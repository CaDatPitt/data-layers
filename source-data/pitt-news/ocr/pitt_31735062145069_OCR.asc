ACTIVITIES BOARD
WILL GET PLAN FOR
STANDA_R_l_)IZED KEYS

Leaders In Campus Activities
Favor Standard Key
Design

i

A report on the designs for a
standard key for all campus activi-
ties will soon be submitted to the

student activities board of student
council,‘ John R. Johnson, acting
dean of men, has announced.

- By this new system one standard
activity key inscribed with the name
of the activity will supplant the in-
dividual keys ‘now awarded by the
variousactivities. A vote on the pro-
posal will be taken by all campus
organizations at the end of the se-
mester, it is announced. Views on
the proposal have been expressed
by campus leaders.

Harold Johnston, Med. '31, chair-
man of the student relation commit-
tee of Student. Council, says “a
standard key will abolish the load-
ing down‘ of students with a string
of various keys. Individual activity
keys are too much like the orna-
ments worn by primitive men.” ,

Joseph Cupp, Col. ’28, chairman of
senior week, believes that the adap-
tation of a standard key will mean
more recognition to activities by
people outside of the University.

, James Lindsay, Bus. Ad. ’30, pres-
ident of Druids, says: “Some keys
are more attractive than others. A
standard key will tend to standard-
ize ,the personal element of all ac-
tivities and do away with individ-
ualism.”

Endicott Batchelder, Bus. Ad. ’30,
member of ‘the student relations
committee, also dislikes the standard
key. He says: -‘

“It will take away the personal
element of activities. No difference
will be shown between a high and

low ranking activity.”- .

.W alt Conrath, Col. ’29, Panther
editor, holds that “the standard key
system cannot work as the stand_-
ard key for Interfraternity Council
membership. Individual taste in
campus activities especially’, of the
publications will be lost if a stand-
ard -key is adopted.”»- _ . _

' Byron Bauer, Col. ’28, president of

college association: “I amiin favor

of the idea. A standard key will keep
‘PWP16 from being overloaded with
a string of keys that do not‘ mean

as mu as they seem gfndica _ .”’
 Retry vnse1xer,~_»Dsiu.~.*» 
o£,,_studen,_t_ council; “I approve of a I

gtgndgrd key ‘for_ c.ain’pl1_S"' activities.
A standard key will-_ bring ‘out the
importance of activities as a whole

»rather than show the rank 01- the
individual activity.”

a... and Gown ‘cm.’
Must Have More Than .
Costume and Lipstick

Rouge, lipstick, silk lingerie and
ﬂimsy costumes may be the attire
of a chorus girl or vaudeville head-
liner, -but the actual qualities and
fine points of a Cap and Gown star
are far more numerous than this in
the opinion of Francis Brantlinger,
recently selected as the “premiere
danseuse” of “Mary-Grow-Round,"
twenty-ﬁrst annual Cap and Gown
production.

Brantlinger, who was a member
of the chorus of “The Red Moon”
and who played the part of Diane
Rlioades in “Miss Mannequin" last
year, has had two years of varied
experience as a “female” in Cap and
Gown. In this year’s production he
will have one of the juvenile danc-
ing roles.

In describing actual requisites of
-a Cap and Gown star, Brantlinger,
frankly, albeit modestly, admitted a
Cap and Gown performer, especially
a “female,” should have stage pres-
ence, a good appearance, poise, and
above all, a pleasing personality that
is spontaneously accepted by an au-
dience.

A Cap and Gown star should not
be one who has been put on the
stage to act mechanically; but one
who combines all these primary
qualities with a true interpretation
and understanding of his role. Very
often, he says, a boy with a com-
paratively good appearance and who
makes up well, fails in his efforts
t9 portray a part, because he lacks
either poise, stage presence, or

 _ a pleasing and impressing
v am’; not least, he believes.

Will Present Pepper Prize
Award At School
Assembly

For the ﬁrst time the Pitt stu-
dent who receives the annual George
Wharton Pepper prize will be in-
cluded in the Owl. Selection of the
student to receive the seventh an-
nual Pepper prize was made last
Friday, C. Stanton _Belfour, chair-
man of the prize committee has de-
clared. Announcement of the name
of the recipient will be made later
at an assembly which will be held
in the middle of May, states Harry

Former Senator George Wharton
Pepper, on being given an, honor-
arium of $100 by the University at
commencement in 1921, used this
amount in creating the Pepper prize.
The sum is given annually by Mr.
Pepper to the student, man or
woman, in any class of any depart-
ment, who shall be designated by a
committee of students as conforming
most closely to the type which in
their judgment is the type that the
University should aim to produce.

,The committee, former Senator
Pepper suggested, should be com-
posed of one representative of each
class in each department, chosen by
students, and each person so chosen
should accept office without previous
commitment respecting the person to
whom the award should be made.
At the request of Chancellor Bow-
man Mr. Pepper has again renewed
the prize oﬁ'er, but due to the late
date and the desire to include the
receiver of the prize in the 1929
Owl, it was decided by the Chancel-
lor to have the members of the prize
committee appointed by deans of the
various schools.

Those previously awarded the Pep-
per prize are Lawrence 1. Kline-
stiver, Charles R. Foster Jr., Ira
Hill, Anna B. Schaab, J. Clyde Bar-
ton and Charles Reginald Wilson.

Lawrence 1. Klinestiver, winner of
the prize in 1922, is now with the
White Motor Corporation of Cleve-
land. Charles R. Foster Jr., win-
ner in 1923, was graduate manager-
of student activities here last year
and is now taking graduate work in
higher education at Harvard Univer-
sity. Ira_Hill, winner in 1924, is a
practicing attorney with an office
in the Commonwealth Building.
Anna B. Schaab, selected in 1925,
is the only woman that has ever re-
ceived the Pepper prize. Miss Schaab
is at present teaching in Union High
School, Knoxville. J. Clyde Barton,

   

1926,  winner, is teaching school.

PERCI VAL HUNT ROOMS WITH CHANCELLOR;
INSPIRESI COUNTRY SMIGGENS TO WRITE

I ﬁrst met him one May morn-
ing down the old wooden steps from
Al mni Hall, between the for-
syt ias. As he went down the steps
the sun shone through the bushes;
it shone on his silver gray suit, on
his silver gray knitted tie, and on
the silver rims of hisglasses. His
head was cocked to one

soms. I was a country boy, and I
looked at him hard, so hard that
when he passed, he looked at me
over the tops of his glasses, and
clipped off a curt “hello.”

Later when I sat in his Shakes-
peare class, I realized who he was.
Here this teacher with silvery gray
words made sixty Pitt students for-
get school, and other things, and
think of old England and the sunny
wind-swept shores of Italy. He
made them realize the reality of sit-
ting in the woods, and watching the
sunlight on a maple leaf. Meticulous
in his speech, in his thoughts, and
even in his dress, never in a rush
to get to or away from class, he
lives in that quiet world of his, and
revels in the poetry of being alive.
When he talks, he draws lines on
the blackboard; sometimes he makes
rows of little stars; and when he
gets excited he constructs a whirl
of circles that looks like a snail.
Often he twirls his watch chain
with a key hooked to the loose
end around his ﬁnger. A fellow
told me once that it was a Phi Beta
Kappa key: but that makes no dif-
ference.

He has organized one of the
best departments of English compo-
sition in the United States that
teaches all the young Smiggins who
come from: the corn ﬁelds, and from
milking cows, to write good sen-
tences. John Fredrick, Roger L.
Sergel, Walter L. Myers, and our
new athletic director, W. Don Har-
rison, were all at one time members
of the English faculty. Mr. Harri-
son learned the rudiments of short
story writin in Mr. Hunt’s class
when Mr. unt was head of the
English department at the Univer-
sity of Iowa. Ruth Suckow and
Walter Muhlenberg, the author of
Prairie, began to write under the
tutelage of Mr. Hunt.

Since 1910 he has done much to

entirely disappeared since then.

Sometimes he tells his friends of
the days he roomed with Chancellor
Bowman when they both were grad-
uate assistants in the English de-
partment at Iowa. The future chan-
cellor of the University of Pitts-
burgh was working on some sketch-
es, and he had some trouble organiz-
ing his material. So in the eve-
nings they used to get together and
do their stuff.

Yes, this is the same man who
awakens his groggy students with,

“Hark hark the lark at heaven's

gate sings,
And Phoebus'giiis arise. . ."

He is thecnian who wears timid
green shirts, and looks so cool and
unruifled in class on May mom-
ings. Yet sometimes on these days
he quotes, :

“Bring me my bow of shining gold,
Bring me my arrows of desire,
Bring me my spear, O clouds ‘unfold
Bring me my chariot of fire.’’,_

PITT WOMEN DEFEAT

1928 intercollegiate season at the
Congress of Women's clubs Satur-
day night debating the question “Re-

should Cease to protect by Armed
Force the Investments of its Citi-

Sylvia Berman, Col. ’30, represented
Pitt. The negative argument was
presented by Emilie Jones, Florence

bers of this year’s graduating class
at Oberlin. Professor W. M. Parrish,
men’s debate coach and head of the
department of public speaking, pre-

CATHEDRAL STEEL ’
WILL GO UP SOON

Raising of Steel Beams to
Start Early In
April

 

 

Over on the Cathedral lot they are
begiiihing preparations for the

raising of the steel superstructure .'

of Pitt’s Cathedral or Learning.
They will have a derrick on the job
in the ﬁrst week of April and a
week later the ﬁrst steel beams will
rise from the concrete foundations,
telling the world that Chancellor
Bowman's dream begun three years
ago is fast becoming a reality. Der-
ricks will swing steel beams into
place amid the noisy rivetings of a
score of workmen and the hopes and
ambitions of a daring pioneer will
become wordly goods.

A ramp is being constructed along
Bigelow Boulevard side of the ‘cathe-
dral lot to provide easy access in
bringing the huge cranes inside of
the foundations. Within the next
week much of the 4,000 tons of steel
needed for the basement and four
ﬂoors above it will already be placed
in a convenient position for the der-
ricks.to raise it up into position so
that workmen may begin the task
of riveting the girders and beams
together.

The John L. Mullen Construction
Company has secured the contract
for the steel erection and will sup-
plement the present force of thirty-
six men until ﬁfty men will be at
work on the structure. Because of
the unusual construction of the
Cathedral of Learning a large part
of the steel had to be specially rolled
at the plant of the Jones and Laugh-
lin Steel Company and then was fab-
ricated by the McClintic-Marshall
Company.

A steam shovel and a Fordson
tractor have been used the past week
to pull out the steel pilings around
parts of the foundation to remove
the ﬁll in order that walls and
foundations can be made accessible
for waterprooﬁng. The Permanent
Waterprooﬁng Company is making
the concrete works water tight by
a process in which ﬁnely divided iron
particles mixed with a sal-ammoniac
paste are used. The paste is painted
over the walls and is drawn into the
small pores in the concrete by capil-
lsryaaction. The iron  thus

“I believe in the resurrection of
Christ because he carried in his
personality those things which are
absolutely be rid the reach of
death,” said i‘. C. Wallace Petty
in his talk to the Y. W. C. A. at a
noon meeting Monday. Dr. Petty
spoke on the third of the pre-Easter
subjects, “He is not here, but is
risen."
Dr. Petty pointed out that from
the mechanist’s vision of the uni-
verse, every thing is governed by
some law, and accordi ~ to these
laws resurrection was impossible.
He believes it is not aseimpossible
as the mechanist’s doctrine that
the universe just happened. Dr.
Petty refuses to believe in the resur-
rection of Christ imgly _on the

round that it is in e Bible and
is a common belief. He believes in
the resurrection because there were
certain values in Christ's life which
were beyond death.
If these can die, there is no pur-
pose in the universe said Dr. Petty.
One of these deathless values was
His co-o eration with the universe.
“Christ ad the powerto tune in‘,
and like the captain _ in Conrad’:
“ boon,” He set His prow in the
teet of the storm and with all the
steam on ‘Ahead.’_”, .-

“Among the first items ‘that’
strike our attention as we re-
’ view the news of the Depart-

include visits to many of the

f “_. umni who have taken
" pride in the gro h and exten- '

it is still growing. There are at

DEAN. THYRSA AMOS, at the

Penn last Saturday, gave her stamp
of'approval to using the funds in

for'the establishment of a Research
Fellowship, and then outlined dan-
ger signals'in the choosing of per-
sons and subjects. She felt, that the
recipient should have had her un-
dergraduate degree for at least ﬁve
years,'sl'lould still have the “ﬁre" of
study and research for the love of
the subject and not for the ﬁnancial
advantages a PhD degree often af-
fords.’ Her suggestions and list of
authoritative sources of information
on the subject of Fellowships will
greatly aid the committee, if it
should decide to recommend theruse
of .the money for such purpose.

Mrs. John 0. Miller, graduate of
Vassar and chairman of the Penn-
sylvania League of Women Voters,
urged the adoption of thesixth and
thirteenth proposed state constitu-
tional amendments to be voted on at
the fall. election, which’ will allow
local sections the option of adopting
and using voting machines.. She ex-
pressed her opinion that if. the meas-
ure is not passed in this election it
will be another ten years before the
people are ‘given another oppor-
tunity to vote on it. She asked the
alumnae to do a little research work
of their own on the various bond
issues‘ to be proposed.’ Requested for
her own opinion of them she] an-
swered that she intended to vote
against all, since the im rovements
wanted and provided for n the bond
issues can all be paid for out.of cur-
rent funds, if public money is more
wisely spent. Her remark that it_ is
not college girls who are. becoming
active in politics and in civic mat-
ters’ of -the community gave food
for thought. » _ ‘ '

‘ lion at close range. KManufactured conditions along

 In “horrible environments.

Attempts have been made
to show the senators’ that the railroads have conspired
to force coal operators to‘ break the union and dis-

 H regard the principle of collective bargaining, a prin-

ciple which‘ in the opinion of Psssmnnr Coouncn is
1 “now accepted in American life.” RocKsr'1:LLnu,

 . Sriiiwal, and R. B. MBLLON-—leaders in coal oper-

ating» circles-——have been quizzed by the committee.

. Operators‘ in the Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana
districts cannot compete with lower cost ﬁelds in Ken-
 and Virginia. and pay the miners $7.50 a day, the
senators hear from CARL E. Lssmzn, rice-president
of fthh Pittsburgh Coal Company. He further charges
that railroads are discriminating against the Penn-
sylvania bituminous producers. To him the J ackson-
ville Agreement was not “morally and legally” bind-
ing and he broke it in 1925 by hiring. miners at $6
a a day. Because it was employing non-union miners
at the time the agreement was signed, the Pittsburgh

I  Coal Company claims it has acted within its legal

rights. Newspaper advertisements, charging the sen-
store’ with partisan feelings and prejudice, have been
‘traced to so many oﬂicials that the senators‘ have

a , ceased to fix the responsibility on- any one person.

Now‘ the “radical” element of the United Mine
.,Workers has come forward to proclaim that the solu-

’ . tion to the problem lies in the unionization _of the en-
 -tire southern coal ﬁeld and the innovation of a six-
 ; hour day and ﬁve-day week program. It has charged

Lewis with disloyalty to the cause of the miners and

” . ~ has supplied streamers to eager newspapers for many
. I a day. It is going to split the miners’ ranks’ at a

 time when closest unity is needed, from all appear-

, V . gpces.

The muddle seems hopeless. There are charges and
Counter-charges; there are conflicting facts which ac-
‘ quit all three sides in the question. ‘

But there is one solution upon which all three fac-

 .‘ tors. almost agree: the coal industry can be legis-

lated back to prosperity. Legislation that is required
to permit the operators to consolidate is an amend-
meat of the anti-trust law, and an amendment to the

l v , Interstate Commerce Act, to prevent « railroads from »

. , crushing operators and miners alike by artiﬁcial coal
price depression resulting from their traﬂic sched-
ules. Such legislation under government supervision
will remove. cut-throat competition which has resulted

‘ in current conditions. _

V . University of Pittsburgh student and faculty au-

have for the past two months heard various
viewpoints expressed at Liberal pnd Oxford Club
meetings. by coal operators, representatives of con-

,  ssrvstive and radical elements of the miners, and
 neutral observers of strike conditions.

The whole sit-
uation is so ‘many-sided that all one can do is listen
to all that isgbeing offered by all sides and wait for
some oﬁcial action by the senate medical corps.

BELATED

RDSWORTH, we once said in

an examination, irritated us
because he emotcd superﬂuously and
indiscriminately. Do you ever think
the same of us? We ask that be-
cause in trying to describe our atti-
tude to Thorton Wilder's Cabals
(Albert J: Charles Boni, $2.50), it
suddenly occurred to us that sev-
eral weeks ago we had used prac-
tically the same degree of praise to-
wards a book that in no way equals
Cabala. To communicate accurately
the distinct shade of appreciation is
one of the hardest things we know
about.

The name Thornton Wilder, in
the above apology, should have
called to your mind the title’ of
a current book that is both popular
and meretricious, The Bridge of San
Luis Rey. So much did this book
impress us that we detefmined to
read its predecessor, Cabala, pub-
lished in April, 1926. Cabala ﬁlled
us, literally, with an authentic glow,

Our desire was to seek out a
number of people who for one rea-
son or another had never read the
books of Thornton Wilder, and,
when. we had guiled them into si-
lence-—much as the mariner Sam-
uel Colerldge bequeathed to high-
school English classes—to picture
to them Antonino taking long de-

gist’s experiment, learning that at
last one is too bruised by the mis-

Though The Bridge of San Luis
Reg is greater because of the su-
periority of what it says, the prose
and the people, reminiscent of those
in books by Carl Van Vechten and
Aldous Huxley, make Cabala much
more than an ordinary “first novel.”

A Goat Is Chosen

(Indiana Daily Student)
THURSDAY the University of

West. Virginia was oustai from
the North Central association of col-
lcges and secondary schools on
charges of inadequate supervision of
athletic, funds, solicitation of pros-
pective students by coaches with of-
fers of reimbursement for ” their
services and kindred complaints.
The association, of which Indiana is

free training tables, payment of ath-

adequate supervision. of athletic
funds. . .

“Let him who is guiltless ﬁrst cast
a stone.”

Somehow, regardless ‘of the fact
that conditions at West Virginia

ing comes to mind as we read of the
indictment of the Mountaineers.
Inadequate supervision of athletic
funds is charged. It is probable that
there are a great many other schools
in the country where there is in-

And there probably are in existence
cases where the opposite condition
is true. Where there is a great deal

is convenient to have lots of book-
keeping, bookkeeping that is almost
too speciﬁc and too certain to be
true. L

The executive committee very
justly stated that the academic
health and character interests should
rank ﬁrst. So far, so good. Then
it condemned free training tables
and paying of athletes.

Without doubt it would be far
more ideal were such practices not
in existence. But the facts are that
they are in existence, because‘ in the
present age the school that does not
practice them in some form and to a
certain degree is out in the cold as
far as getting athletes is concerned.
Those facts are undeniable. .

West Virginia solemnly is charged
with having an alumni fund to en-
courage athletes to attend the uni-
versity. When you read the indict-
ment you struggle to keep from a
horse laugh. Try to enumerate a
string of schools that do not have
just such funds for just such pur-
poses. They may be better disguised
than was West Virginia’s, more
cleverly handled, but nevertheless,
under any other name they still
would be the same. ‘

Many a school in the country con-
ducts what amounts to a free train-
ing table through the backing and
support of the fraternities, which
form the backbone of the athletic
system. Perhaps they are not run
in the same way as West Virginia's,
but they are to all intents and pur-
poses the‘ same thing. To anyone
who knows the facts about the ways

PITTSBURGH SYMPHONY

E LIAS BREESKIN, erst-

while concertmaster, drill-
master, and general handyman
with the Pittsburgh Symphony
Society, conducted his ﬁrst con-
cert with the organization Sun-
day evening. As at the ﬁrst
concert the crowd was large
and enthusiastic, but this time
no one applauded the minister
who asked the invocation.

It is perhaps too soon to ex-
pect any radicsl changes in the
playing, and certainly the per-
fect ensemble will not come for
several Yﬁnrs, but I noticed
fewer ragged attacks than at"
the last concert. The strings‘,
too, seem to have improved in
unity. The lamentable thing
about it all is that it is far
too early to allow the director
free imaginative play, and with
such a program of “war horses”
‘his style was rather cramped.
The soloist of the evening was
Margaret Matzenauer, of the
Metropolitan. She has a pow-
erful, dramatic contralto voice’
that is not, always pleasing be-
cause of a rough top register.
Unfortunately her best voice is‘
gone, and one hearing" her for
the ﬁrst time receives an un-,
favorable impression.

The orchestra program opened
with the Vorspielto Wa‘gner’s+—
Die Meistersinger. This work,
along with parts of Parsifal and
Tristan und Isolde, represent
Wagner at his best.. Despite
some very ragged work-tin. the
fugue section the energy of the
orchestra carried it along.

Bethoven’s Fifth, Symphony
was the major work for the eve-'
ning. -The andanto and the
scherzo went nicely enough but
when it came to the opening. of
the ﬁnal movement, the chords
in the massed orchestra missed
ﬁre and gave a ﬂat ending to
an otherwise good interpreta-
tion. .

The second half of the pro-
gram opened with a group of_

. lighter selections, including the
Adagiettoi from Bizé.t’s L’Ar-A
lesiennc music, an arrangement
of Kreisler’s Tambourin Chin-
ois by Jan Falck of the orches-
tra, and Percy G‘rainger’s Shop‘-'
her-d’s Hey.‘ Perhaps these num-
bers _. gave the orchestra a much
needed rest—-that is the only
excuse I can-.._ see for their being.
on a symphonic program. There
are thousands of works, essen-
tially symphonic in character
and just as light, which could
have been played in place of
these tid-bits. And was the
Shepherd's Hey really impor-
tant enough to be repeated?"

The evening ﬁnished with s
“rip-snorting” interpretation of
Tschaikowsky’s 1812- Overture.
All the inhibited noises of the .
orcihestra had a chance to burst»
forth, and they did. A little-
huskier set of chimes would«
have sounded to advantage ove_r=
the massed brass in’ the rear’
row. '

The next and ﬁnal concert it
to be given April 22,  Eu-
gene Goosensas conductor and
Moritz Rosenthal, pianist, as
soloist. Mr. Goosens was here
last year and he will be most
welcome this year. We have a
much better orchestra to give
him, too. '

it, but it, rather frightens us,
for we laughed so much and
hummed the tunes at the operas
that we failed to get a critical-

LIVES OF‘ GREAT MEN
ACK in,the good old Laurcntian days, a young but

B ambitious tadpole mated with a shad, and, in
the happy days that followed, this union was blessed
with offspring, one dirty little squirt. When the shad
was allowed her ﬁrst look at the lively red-faced son,
her scales turned into arpeggios from disappointment.
She sang Kol Nidre, recited five chapters from
Lamentations, and divorced the tadpole, who took his
disgrace into the bond business where he later rose
to an executive position.

This quaint domestic tragedy left the dirﬁ little
squirt without a home. He grew moody and took to
eating in the cafeteria. He had no love of life.

In the meantime, all his friends, the’ little boys and
girls he had known in Sunday School, were

A greater gambler than the man
who plays the roulette wheel; more
a seeker of romance than Don Quix-
ote is the astronomer who gambles
with fate, and who chases the
“moon's shadow” around the world.
In this role will the day's leadin
astronomers wage several thousan
dollars and six months of eﬂfort on
the chance that it will surely be
clear for live minutes at about mid-
day, on May 9, 1929, at a spot on
the other side of the world in north-
err} hSum1a1.tra. H _ﬂ

oug a 11 cc pee expedx on
means a vast amount of hard work,
it forms, in many ways, one of the
main elements of romance in an as-
tronomer’s life—the journeys to re-
mote and often almost inaccessible
spots, the setting up of the instru-
ments, the meeting and solving of
unexpected diﬁiculties with only the
to ‘s at hand. More by chance, per-
haps, than through deliberate choice,
Dr. Heber D. Curtis, director of Al-
legheny Observatory, has followed
the moon eight separate times, which
is nearly, though not quite, a world
record. It is possible that Dr. Cur-
tis may have theopportunity to go
with some American expedition next
year for the eclipse. Dr. Curtis
states that he hopes to increase his
total number to ten.

Dr. Curtis points out that there is
no postponing a total solar eclipse.
When it is due, it comes and that is
all there is to it-—-on time almost to
the second and as unchangeable as
the motions of the earth, moon and
the sun themselves. Only rarely
does it last as long as seven min-
utes; if the weather is cloudy, or the
astronomer has not succeededin get-
tin his instruments ready, Nature
wil accept no excuse, and the as-
tronomer must wait a year or two at
least for another favorable oppor-
tunity.

“Should we decide to remain in
Pittsbu 11 until the ‘mountain will
come to lahomet,’ we should have to
wait about three hundred and sixty
years, on the average, before a to-
tal eclipse would be seen,” the au-
thority holds.

So it is, shows Dr. Curtis, that
the astronomer is willing to “take a
chance,” to journey thousands of
miles, to set up and equip rather ex-
tensive temporary observatories at
the ends of the earth, and to hope
that a certain three or ﬁve-minute
interval will be free from clouds, all
because there are some things about
that star which we call the sun
which he can study only at the to-
tal solar eclipse.

It is interesting to note that since
modern astronomy has not had
photography for many decades, we
have had only about fifty-four min-
utes since" the world began to study
the corona thoroughly, brings out
Dr. Curtis.

In recent years, another reason
has been added for observing these
total solar eclipses. There has
prung up, claims the astronomer, the
new theory of relativity, which has
divided the scientiﬁc world into two
camps, one accepting, the other re-
jecting the theory. 4

On Dr. Curtis’ voyage to Sumatra
in 1926, he was accompanied by Mrs.
Curtis and his fourteen-year-old son,
Baldwin, both of whom took an ac-
tive part in the eclipse observations.
Of Dr. Curtis’ trips three were con-
ﬁned to the United States, two were
in distant Sumatra, one in Russia,
one on the high plateau of central
Mexico, and the other far north on
the coast of Labrador. These trips
have taken over two years in prep-
aration and in travel, have. meant a
total mileage nearly equal to three
times around the world, and all for
twenty-four minutes of ac tu al
eclipse work.

WILL HOLD SONG
CONTEST APRIL 27

Annual Competition Among
Sororities Aims For
Friendship

 

 

The third annual song contest,
sponsored by a council, which con-
sists of the presidents of the wom-
en's fraternities, will be held Friday,
April 27, at Heinz House. The pur-
pose of the contest is to foster
friendship, inter-fraternity relations,
and at the same time to increase
the spirit within the respective fra-
ternities, states Lottie Reich, Col.
'29, chairman of the contest. Miss
Reich is assisted by Katherine Till,
2%., '28, and Katherine Hazlett, Ed.,

Only eight girls will be permitted
to represent each fraternity. The
words of the song must be written
by an active or by active members
of the fraternities. The music ma
or may not be original; no solos wi
be permitted.

T e judges for the contest will be
Miss Thyrsa Amos, Mrs. J. H.
Greene, and Miss Ellen M. Geyer.
Their judgment will be based upon
group spirit, musical quality, and
originality of ideas contained in the
words. The sorority, which in the
opinion of the judges, best fulﬁlls
these qualiﬁcations will be awarded
a silver loving cup. This cup has
been won in the, last two years by
Delta Delta Delta sorority. The so-
rority, w1n_ning the cup three years
m_ succession, will permanently re-
tain 1t in its possession.

OU wouldn't join the first rt-eternity that gave you a

bid unless you liked it. It should be the same with the
business you cntcr—-don‘t drift into it, just. because it‘
“turned up.“ First, know whether you are interested in a
certain line of work, then ﬁt your-selffor it by proper selec-
tion of courses, and by reading and observation. Having
made your selection, do not let chance propositions deter you.

Apply this test ofﬁtnm to the bond business, ifyou are
considering it. Because it requires a high degree oftraiuing
and ability, the compensation and opportunities for the man
adapted to it are unusually good. It may bejust the ﬁeld
for you.

Assuming that you have made as studied decision to enter
the bond business, the best start you can make is to choose
a conservative, reliable bond house that will provide a sub-
stantial background for your own elfortm. Ally yourself
with a firm that will take pains to train you for effective
work. In the Halsey, Stuart 8: Co. training schools, each

Hyatt Swings From
Hardwoods to Stage

. BL “CHICK” KENNY

ley Hyatt of Uniontown and
Pittsburgh exclusively, A and As mem-
ber in goodstanding with Red Carl-
son’s championsliipquint of Decem-A
ber 1927' to March 1928. will step’
behind the footlights before long in
the 3378154 edition of the Cap and
Gown Frolic. This was made’ known
today and conﬁrmed by reliable
sources. ’

Charley whois aﬁashy blondeiof
the leap-year type will be one of the
features of the cgming burlesque.
Deep mystery shrouds the-heavy role
which the Chipper is slated to pre-
sent. Howe'ver,‘the writer has been
able to delve into the Edmunsonian
archives most thoroughl and is sure
that the Boyfriend wil' be theat-
tendant to the title roler, Herb
Dent, erstwhile funny boy and bi
shot of the campus as far as b
is concerned. A

Master" Charles -will be responsible
for thepart of the Silent suitor, a
character portrayal which only a
Uniontown Hyatt is capable of pro-_
ducing. Concerning the =I'l'.1IIlber of
lines the said Druid is required to
memorize, they will be nil.

As far. as open mouthiatics are
concerned, Charley will be silent un-
less he happens by chance to get
sleepy in the last ‘act and yawns
most profusely. However, we feel

A sure that this malady will ' not come

to pass, for. Mr. Hyatt is "a.
bear..for- long drawn:out dates, and
will be in the mood which-generally
requires late» hours andlate break-
fasts. . .

Basketball willnot be on the menu
or‘ the stage for that matter during
the entire production of the show,
but if Herbie carries a1 basket, watch
out, for a dribble. Thisis not press
gentistuﬁ’ for the coming show,‘ so
don't get me wrong.-

“Although it is impossible to size
up these men at the first tryout,”
says Coach Sutherland, “they look
good, the little ones as well as the
big. The next season may be slow,
but the one -following ought to show
the true merits of experienced men.”

 

Alumni Team Loses

To All-Pitt Sextet

,.One of the fastest‘ girls’ basket-
ball games ever. held in the '1hrees
Gym was staged Saturday-when the
:A1l-Pitt honor team won a victory
over the Pitt Alumnae team of 1924-
25-26, by a score of 46-23._. The co-
eds were preparing for_tlus ult all
season and were well primedfor the
occasion. .

Alice Walton and Grace Austin
starred for the coeds, while_ Venus
Shakarian and Jean Muter did some
stellar shooting for the Alumnae.
An outstanding feature of the game
was the unusual team work dis-
played by both sides. Many sensa-
tionallong shots were tossed by both
teams. The Alumnae Team despite
lack of practise put up a hard ﬁght.

In the preliminary game ‘Cathe-
dral High of Pittsburgh eked out
a 13-9 victory over the Pitt re-

 FOR PHILLY

Wright, Mango Entrain For

Intercollegiate ‘ Swim .
Meet Tonight

 

Captain “Bus” Wright and Al
Mango will leave tonight for~Phila-
delphia, where they will represent
Pitt at the National _Swimrning Iii-
ter-collegiates. Over 28 colleges and
universities V will be represented ‘ at
the championships, which are being
held at the University of Pennsyl-
vania. This event will bring to-
gether the best swimmers of the
nation, and the results "will show
where Uncle Sammay expect to find
his iiatators» for; the 192 ~‘ 801ympics
at ‘Amsterdam, Holland. A _

Captain Wright led the swimming
team through an : undefeated season,
thus making the third‘:Pitt team to
accomplish such‘ a feat ' this year.
Wrighthas taken_ﬁrst place in every
event that he -has been entered ‘in
this year. During the swim season
“Bus” took eighteen ﬁrst places for
a total of seventy-ﬁve points, break-
in’ no less. than six records and
tying another. A1 “Pony” ‘Mango
was also , a consistent scorer for
Pitt. Mango was undefeated in
every» backstroke race in which he
participated this season. A _

Although a full team will not be
se'n.t.t0 Penn, Pitt. will be represented
so far as individual honors are con-
cerned. Judging from the marks
made by both Wright and Mango, as
they come very close to the national
times which have stood for years, it
will not be surprising to have the
Pitt representatives return! with .a
titleorso. ‘ ’ . Q.

sylvania, Ohio and West Virginia

tion took art in t e event; and Dr.
Harry C. cKown, associate profes-
sor of secondary education, chairman

be given, ‘including a comprehensive,
special subject and ﬁnal exam. The
comprehensive test will be two hours
in length and must be taken by all
entrants- It will be given in, the
morning, and its material, drawn
from English, social studies, natural
science and mathematics, will be

A what the average high school senior

may reasonably be expected to know.

The special subject tests will be
given in Latin, English, biology,
chemistry, French, general history,
mathematics, physics and Spanish.
There' will be one test this year in

- each subject.

Gentlemen:

I sure get some riled when I see
where some fellow iscrowing over the
fact that being older, and having run
into Edgeworth sooner than his less
fortunate compatriots, he challenges
the world as the champion long-time

member of the Edgeworth Club.

He_doesn’t deserve any medals. He
got his reward in the enjoyment of his
smokmgor the added number of years.
He was dust lucky in starting sooner,

that's a

However, if you care to delve into
ancient history, look up when they
first started to pull down the old Grand

. Central Station in New York,‘ then
, add at least six months to that, and

you will arrive at the approximate

time when I ﬁrst joined the club.

I have smoked at least one pipeful
of every other tobacco I have seen
advertised, sometimes through neces-
sity, but most of the time to prove to
myself that I have been right in stick-

in: to the old blue tin. »
Yours truly,
