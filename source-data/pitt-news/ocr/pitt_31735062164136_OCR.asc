UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Students Still Favor Johnson  

. Loch Replaces Heller
 Acting  Director

John Robert Loch, a graduate assistant tothe Dean ‘of

Men, has been appointed acting director of the Student
Union, Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor of student

3;. and general affairs, has announced.

Loch is replacing Larry Heller, who resigned last month
to become director of student activities at Harper’ College

in Binghamton; New York.

The key word for Loch is co-operation between planners and

participants in the activities of SU.

_ The SU should.be a University center where the student or pro-
fessor can broaden ‘ himself. The educational and enjoyment op-‘
portunities must be presented and the student must feel a desire to
‘participate. This way, according to Loch, the student will feel a part
of the University and gain identity with himself and the institution.

Loch uses an amended statement -of the "late President Kennedy’s
to describe his commandment “ask not. what the SU can do for you,
but what you can do for the SU.”¢

participating in SU activities can

Loch. The members of the SUB
and its committees should work to

Second ‘News’ Poll Indicates

According to a second Pitt News poll, there has been no trend) towards Barry Gold-__
water. The second poll, like the first,“ indicated that 80% of the students favored Lyndon‘

Johnson for President. . - . r
The following questions were on the poll:

2

1) Are you a registered voter? If so, how? — I 
2) If you are under 21, do you generally lean towards the Democratic or Republican; 

Party? .
3) If you were to vote today, who would you vote for?

4) Who would you like to see as the Democratic Vice—Phesiden-

tial candidate? ’ * “

5) What isyour religion? Color? __ _

Forty per ‘cent of the students polled favored Attorney General
Robert Kennedy as the Vice-Presidential candidate on the Demo-
cratic ticket, 20 per cent favored Hubert Humphrey, eight percent
favored Adlai Stevenson, four per cent favored Sargent Shriver, the _' .'
other 28 percent were either undecided or favored some other A
person. _ » '
‘ ' Republicans Favor Johnson

Registered Republicans favored President Johnson over Barry
Goldwater by a 3-2 margin. Seventy per‘ cent of the students with
Republican leanings favored, Senator Goldwater.-

Ninty-ﬁve per cent of the registered Democrats polled favored
President Johnson to Goldwater.\All of those ‘students who had
Democratic leanings wanted Lyndon Johnson for the Presidency.

The minorities’ polled all were very strong for the Democratic
incumbent. Every Negro polled voted for Johnson. 95 per cent of the .
Jews polled voted for Johnson, and 98 per cent of the Catholics poll-
ed voted for Johnsong A   i  A   " ' “" A" ' '

Protestants Favor Johnson .

The White Protestant vote also favored Johnson, "but only by 60
per cent. , A

Many _of those who voted indicated dissastisfaction with
both candidates. One person polled said, ‘‘I don’t like Johnson,

' but I guess I have to vote for him because ‘Goldwater would
be worse.” - 1

Another said, “They’re both inept, but if I have to have an inept

President, I don’t want one who is going to do any defoliating."
Goldwater Has Ideas _

Others favored Senator Goldwater because they felt President
Johnson was indecisive. “At least Goldwater has some ideas,” an-
other said. “Johnson might have gotten a" lot done, but none of it
was really on his own. I don’t think he has come up with an‘ idea yet
that has really been his own.”

As shown by the poll, the name foremost in the minds of those

polled concerning the Vice-Presidency was Attorney General Ken-
nedy. Most favored him because they agreed with his_liberal ideas.
' One Goldwaterite polled, however, wanted Kennedy on the
Democratic ticket with Johnson becau.se, “it would clinch the South
for Goldwater.” \ ,

  Critic Discusses Film Trends

THE ‘ PITT

 

 

.1".

News -4-’ Monday, July 27, "1964

After his Midday talk on Wednesday, Bosley Crowther mentioned, “I like to talk
about movies.” In his lecture and at the luncheon and informal "discussion which follow-
ed Crowther vividly demonstrated this fact.

The New York Times movie critic brought not only a wide knowledge and under-

ate his popular topic.

Pointing out the significance of
the movie as an art form and a
meons of mass communication,
Crowther encouraged" more for-
mal study and consideration of
the film craft. This would raise
the level of audience understand-

ing and appreciation and would_

eventually increase the quality of
the average film. ' _
Changes in Movies
Crowther then described the
vast changes which the movie in-

dustry has undergone since the

advent of. television.

When the number of tele-
vision sets in the United States
multiplied unt_il ninety per cent
of all homes included one, at-
tendance at movies quite logic-
ally dropped off. Seventy per
cent fewer fans saw movies in
1952 than in,Hollywodo’s rec‘-,
ord year, 1947, when 80 mil-
lion viewers -per week visited
their neighborhood theatre.

Just when things seemed .dark- v

est for movieland, cinerama and
cinemascope were introduced and
with them came the Big Picture.
Movies began their comeback.

Audiences Leave T.V.’s

The huge screen with its spec-
tacular films such as “The Ten
Commandments” and “Ben Hur”
(to date the biggest jackpot of all
with a gross of over ‘70 million
dollars) was enough to lure audi-
ences out of. their T. V. equipped‘
living rooms.

After discussing their transi- '
tion in movies, Crowther point-
ed out signiﬁcant trends in.the

industry today. One is the new. '

comedy craze—that is comedy
on_ a‘ lavish scale with several
stars and lots of sex as opposed
to the family" comedies of the
30’s and 40’s.

Another trend is the decrease
in the number of musicals, which
Crowther attributed to the fact
that today’s audiences, searching

for more realism and sophistica-
tion, no longer enjoy the light,‘

contrived formula -which musi-
cals usually must follow. This is
just the opposite of current fash-
ion on the stage.
Increased Foreign Films

The most significant and re-
warding trend, Crowther indicat-
ed, is the increased interest in the
excellent films being made in Eu-
rope and the Far East. These
films, especially some made re-
cently in England, Italy, France,
Sweden and Japan, have expres-

sed more depth of human under-”

standing and cultural background
than the average American film.

-This, said the Times critic,
is possibly due to the severe}

and realistic approach to lifef;

which these countries have beenj
forced to take as a result of’
World War II. , ' ‘-

. /In

SPEAKING AT last Wednesday’s Midday Series, Bosley Crowther,
movie critic of the New York Times, encouraged more‘ formal
study and consideration of the film craft as a necessary component
toward increasing the quality of the average Hollywood film.

The effects, of the foreign film
on the U. S. movie industry have
been several. First, a more en-
lightenedand educated audience
has been cultivated since the
foreign film requires subtle un-
derstanding and attention. -’

Loosening Code

A second effect has been the
loosening of the American movie
production code. Homosexuality,
nudity, crude language and other
delicate or controversial subjects,
all unheard of in U. S. films a
few years ago, are now becoming
acceptable, _ These ingredients
might be good or vulgar depend-
ing on how they are handled on
the screen. Any scene must add
to the purpose and theme of the
film, not merely seek.to shock or
thrill. '

Censorship, Crowther vigor-
ously explained, is not the meth-
od to determine the difference.

Capable critics and audiences

will eventually point the pro-

ducers in the proper direction.

Movies made in bad taste will

eventually die out on their own.

The lecture closed on an op-
timistic note, indicating the im-
portant future which the movie,
possibly “. . . our most potential
art form,” holds in store.

Strangelove and Cleo
It was interesting that at both

“the luncheon and the afternoon

question session the first ‘two films
Crowther was asked to comment
upon were Dr. Strangelove and
Cleopatra. He felt the first was
ineffective since it dealt withgan
over-worked subject and was “ir-
responsible” rather than merely
satirical in the treatment of its
characters. -

He said that “Cleopatra,” on
‘the other hand, has been mis-

judged due to the unfortunate
publicity given the film. Some
of the picture’s merits, such as
the excellent screen play and
true picture of the leading
characters, were mentioned.

Crowther’s visit to the Univer-
sity brought fresh insight into
one of our most significant forms
of communication and entertain-

ment-—the movies.

University Hospital uses a team of
doctors to care for a pa’oient.in-‘
stead of an individual who cares
exclusively for a patient.

The controversy arose after the
Pennsylvania Medical Society and

sylvania issued a joint statement
procla-iming the right of “all” pa-
tients to choose their own doctor.
Some of the doctors in these or-
ganizations speciﬁcally questioned
the practices of Presbyterian-Uni-
versity Hospital, where Kerr—Mills
patients are classed in the _free-
care category with regard to choice
of physicians.
Care Not Diminished

Dr. Sheps defended the system
against charges that a Kerr-Mills
patient’s freedom or quality of
care would be diminishedunder a
team—care program.

“‘The notion,” Dr. Sheps said,

“that high quality medical care
consistent with the dignity of
the individual can only be ob-
tained if the patient chooses a
"single physician is an over-sim-
plification of the reality of med-
ern day medical care.”
, “It overlooks,” he continued,
“the fact that in the United States
today there are millions of self-
supporting people who freely de-
cide to obtain theirmedical care
by choosing a group of physicians
or an institution for this purpose.”
Choose Institution J
Dr. Sheps cited Mayo Clinic,
Crile Clinic and Leahy Clinic as
examples of institutions where pa-
tients choose “on the basis of their
faith and confidence in the group
of physicians or the reputation of
the institution,” n-ot “on the basis
‘of a single physician.”

In fact, Dr.
that the services provided by
instituions affiliated with medi-

ter than the private services of
many hospitals.
He feels that “the very exist-

Prof Denies Inadequate Care
Given To Kerr-Mills Patients

By,ALEX D’IPPOLITO

Dr. Cecil G. Sheps, Professor of Medical and Hospital
Administration, answered’ charges that patients receiving
medical aid under the Kerr-Mills bill are being denied ade-T
quate care by not being allowed to choose their own physi-
cians at the Presbyterian-University Hospital. I

single doctor.” The Presbyterian- & ‘

stimulus provided by the frame-.
work of teaching and the constant

availability of physicians . . . is in ,

sharp contrast with the conditions
that are often observed on the pri-
vate services of many hospitals.”
Once a patient chooses an in-
stitution with team care, he has al-‘
ready made a choice on the type of
care he desires, Dr. Sheps stated.
The patient could have just as

Student Plays Abstract
But Moods Compelling

Ronald Caplan’s, He-It and She—It and J. M. Crawford’s, The
Creation, opened last Wednesday in a rather arty but crowded The-
atregll. The capacity crowd of forty persons seemed surprised that
both gplays were over In such a short time.

Though written by different authors, the two plays have much
in common: both are short, both are abstract in the extreme, and
both create an air of depression. '

<He-It and She-It opened’ the bill. The opening conversation
purposely excludes the audience from what is going on. We hope
everything is building to-a revelation, but none is forth-coming. It
is not clear whether the characters are moving in a‘ dream, a fantasy,
or. distorted reality.

“ Effective Expression

‘Ann Senning and James Berry effectively express the need and
misunderstanding which the two characters seem to feel for each
other. But we do not discover enough about them to care what
happens. (

_ The play shows a real potential for dialogue, but it leads no-
where in particular; Large portions of conversation are repeated
which may be a meaningful experiment if it could be made to
contribute to the mood or‘ meaning of the play. If the play’s pur-
pose is to express a feeling of despair and unhappiness, it is suc-
cessful, but no uniderstandingis sought and no attitude revealed.
'_The Creation likewise ﬁnds its strong point in smooth ﬂowing

dialogue. There is also some character deﬁnition. But this play also
is quite short and expresses melancholy with no apparent reason.
Various devises such as strange lighting, sheets over the actors, and
obscure lines seem to indicate something, but it is not clear just what.

An Old Couple Trapped I
An oldcouple, played by Ann Senning and John Cunningham,

and a Master, played by Ream Lazaro, are trapped in a sad place. An

old caretaker, Hamish Patrick, quietly looks after them. The young
Master expresses hope, the old lady, despair, the caretaker, empti-

.ness{ Why they feel these emotions, however, is unknown.

The location like the attitudes is unclear and perhaps is meant
to be, Is it a bomb shelter, a mental home, or a man’s mind? We
do. not know and never learn enough to become involved.

Today many playwrights seem to like abstract or absurd forms

and symbols to the neglect of real people and genuine situations.

.Abstract drama can only_ be meaningful against a background. of
reality. ‘Symbols and moods are relevant only‘ if they cast light on
emotions or situations which the audience can experience. ‘

I Audiencewants to Understand

A  audience must be drawn into the action. This is not to say
that"/everything must be spelled out. ‘Unusual effects and esoteric
dialogue can be signiﬁcant. But emotions and intellects must be

.stimulated to such an extent that the audience wants to understand
. and are rewarded for their seeking.

_ He-It and She—It and The Creation have diﬁiculty in com-
municating. They are, however, a most important type of drama
because they reveal the desire to communicate and the beginning
of expression.

The dialogue is good. A point of view is begun if notdeveloped.

Actors, directors and playwrights have co-operated in a difficult but

. worthwhile venture. '

the Negroes polled said they '
would vote for Johnson, 98 per
cent of the Catholics polled said
they would vote for Johnson, and
95 percent of the Jews polled
said they would vote for Johnson.
Such an edge would be impossible ‘
for Senator Goldwater to over-
come in a student election.

The Protestants, however, also

favored President Johnson, but
by a 3-2 margin, not 19-1 or
100-0. . , -

There is a deﬁnite. lack of
awareness of the ﬁght for the
Vice Presidency in the Democratic
party. Many students were not
even aware of the people who
were being considered. -

Also, I feel the apparent de-
sire for Kennedy as the vice-
presidential candidate is a mat-
ter of ignorance. I could not
help but get the impression that
many picked Kennedy because
his name was foremost in their
minds.

It must be remembered that this
is my opinion, and not an indica-
tion of the poll. Indeed, the poll
cannot predict any trend in the
nation, the state, or even-‘the city.

and Governor Nelson Rockefeller, ‘was
booed from the podiu'm,,for daring to

‘propose ‘an amendment which_ .sought
- to repudiate the Birch Society.

— ‘In his acceptance speech Senator ‘
Goldwater rubbed, salt into the
.wounds of the progressives with his
infamous declaration that “extrem-
ism in the" defense of liberty is no
vice,” etc. — a comment, more rhet-
orical than rational, which has since
forced som‘e' Republicans to announce
that they will campaign for re-elec-

After decrying the lawlessness in
our Northern cities (the police states
of the Deep South were not mention-
ed) and insisting that private property
is the foundation of constitutional gov-
ernment (the Negro Revolution and
civil rights were conspicuously ignor-
ed), nominee Goldwater gave the
Yahoos exactly what they ‘wanted: a
militant, anti-Communist address.

It is simple enough, says the can-
didate. There is a struggle in" the
world between free men and enslav-
ed men, between the people of God
and: godless people, between Abso-

Arab Attacks

Pro-Jew Bios

Editor, The Pitt News: .

Your article concerning the de-
bate on American foreign policy
in the Middle East has been in-
jected with an unconcealed anti-
A_rab bias. This lack of objective-
ness in introducing to American
opinion political realities as they
stand today in the Middle East has

purpose‘ of the debate.

I ﬁnd it necessary here to re-
state the issue from a real Arab
perspective to make things clear.
Arabs think that the outstanding
barrier in the way of good Arab-

’ American relations is Israel,'_a

country which ‘they, ﬁrmly believe
was born out of-~~injustice, ‘aggres-
sion, "and the conspiratorial de-
signs of Western imperialism, and
international Zionism against the
Arab world: They feel that they‘
have been victimized by the West
without committing any guilt that
could justify the dispossession of an
entire Arab homeland in favor of

or-.-Australia could. absorb tens of

lem. .

in‘ the Palestine tragedy, is be-
lieved by Arabs to have been,
and continues to be great be-

both ‘moral and material, of Is-
rael in complete deﬁance of their
national sentiments. Arabs are
-also antagonized by the deliber-
_ate and systematic propaganda
‘activities of Zionists, and their
sympathizers among the so-
called liberals and humanitari-
ans who present Israel to
American opinion as a pioneer
and progressive state struggling
fo-r survival against Arab feudal,-
iism and fanaticism _and an. arti-
ﬁcial and imperialistic Arab
nationalism. 5

These liberals have ‘failed’ to real-

solation that‘the thief is socialist

Zionist pressure which . places

American people second to those
of a determined minority with
dual loyalty. It is worth recall-

a leading American Zionist; ‘has
said a few years ago._ He said
that America’s Jews must have
“courage to declare openly that
they have a double loyalty . .0

and to the state of Israe..”_i .. A

By LARRY BERNFELD
A panel of three analysed “South East Asia, Its Pros-
ppects For the Future” last Monday evening before a small,
but inquisitive audience which was in attendance at the In-
ternational Relations Club’s ﬁnal discussion of the spring

trimester.

5?.

A ‘native Vietnamese priest, a soldier and a political

scientist presented their respec-¢

tive positions to the small assem-
bly‘ in the Stephen Foster Social
Room.

Father Joseph H00, 3 Vietna-
mese from _the northern part of
the country who is. presently
teaching Sociology at Duquesne‘
University, represented the view-
point of a typical Viet’ Nam peas-

“. ant.

‘ ‘Father Hoo remarked that his
, country had been in “a dirty
' war for the last twenty years.”
Aftendefeating the French, the
South Vietnamese trained _to fight
the communists. Peasants from
thenorthtmoved south to ‘escape
the commu.nists—but
were forced to pay taxes and tri-
bute to the communist’ insurgents

“who. entered the villages under"
tithe cover of nightfall.

Unsure of Support
The‘ natives want to fight the
communists, Father Hoo said, but

they question whether or not they

have -the full support of their
allies. —Until they are sure of
this support, few will risktheir
lives, their family’s lives and their
property to fight. ,

Major Arthur Brown, U. S..

7: Army, presently studying in the _

Graduate School of Public and

International Affairs, discussed

the problems that the military

encounters‘ in dealing with an
active insurgent in South Viet

Nam. Major Brown, who has

served as advisor to a Civil

Guard Battalion in Viet Nam,

noted the great need for the al-
3legiance of the people.

the level of generality as he pre-
sented three major questions con-
-cerning American policy in South-
east Asia. >
U. S. in Southeast Asia?

The first question raised was

whether or not the U. S. should be

‘in Southeast Asia .-at all. Taking

into account the positivecase set
forth by Major Brown, which in
essence was to "halt the spread

.of the Communist menace, Schul-

man presented the negative case.
The U. S. had never been in this
area in the past; why now‘? This
area is not important to the U. S.
in any immediate sense.

_ In favor of involvement is
the fact that we are in Southeast
Asia now. No president would
have the nerve to remove U. S.
aid from the area. Further 'dis- "
cussion musttherefore be predi- ,
cated on the fact that the U. S.
is involved, Schulm-an said.

The second major question cen-

ters on why the United States has
become involved. Containment -of

"Red China, and setting up a bar-

rier against Communism has been

forwarded as a reason. Schulman
criticized a containment as being
unrealistic. Such a policy as-
sumac that China is the center
of conflict and would demand
long-term involvement on the part
of the United States.

Creates Stronger Regime
The creation of a stronger re-
gime by allowing institutional de-
velopment and promoting econom-
ic integration has also been sug-
gested as a motive for U. S, in-
volvement. Schulman questioned
the political viability of such cre-
ated regimes._ ' . V
The third aspect Schulman.
discussed centered on the meth-
ods the U_. S. uses in achieving
its goals- The area of counter-
insurgencywarfare, even recog-
nizing U. S. advances, is one in
which the U. S. is still far be-
hind the. Asians. Nonetheless,
‘this’ method has been used.
Expressing a personal pessimism
towards United States action in
Southeast Asia,” Schulman sees
such activity as self-defeating. He

feels that in the eyes of the Viet-

Father Hoo commented on the

Mike Elliott; Marc Mal-

linger and Dave Raudman ..

are meaningless names to
Pittsburghers, but they‘ sig-
nify a new era in Pitt foot-
ball.

Elliott; Mallinger and Raudman
are freshmen football players who
come from Arizona, California
and Missouri, respectively, and

_ their appearance on the freshman

roster means the days of a purely
at
Pitt are though.

The far-flung recruiting done by

, coach John Michelosen and his

staff this year is both by necessity
and choice. It is of necessity be-
cause Western Pennsylvania talent
is so nightly sought after that
schools from across the country

, ﬁght for the talent which years
-ago went mainly to Pitt and Penn

State.
It is due tonecessity also be-
cause with rising academic

standards Michelosen is finding

it more and more difficult to ﬁll
out his roster fromsuch a small

area as Western Pennsylvania.

; The Far West players were re-
cruited by choice, because frank-
ly, any football coach would be
nuts not to -get top-grade players
when the opportunity arises. The
opportunity arose last year when
Pitt had a 9-1 record and sudden-
ly became sought by schoolboys
from all over the country.

While players like Elliot, Mal-
linger, Raudman, Bernie I-Iensgen
of Chicago and Mike Coleman of
Farmington, Michigan, are wel-
come additions to the freshman

‘team, the Western Pennsylvania

area was not in the least forgot-
ten. ‘

Included among the 25 players _

recrunted is the most sought-
after quarterback in Pennsyl-
vania if not the entire country,
Bob Bazylak _ of McKeesport.
With Bazylak doing the throw-
ing McKeesport did more throw-
ing than many pro teams last

‘soon be at hand.

Coach John Michelosen will
have a big job on his hands re-
placing 20 letter winners from
last year’s .team including the en-
tire starting line and two mem-
bers of the regular backﬁeld. In-
cluded in that group were All.-
Americans Paul Martha and Ernie
Borghetti.

Michelosen is . not think-
ing of the past but of what will
happen this year. He’ll need
good replacements for the 2
lettermen lost. ‘ «

Bill Howley, a second-stringer
last year and a third-unit player,
John Verkleeren are the only
letter winners returning at end.
Gone are starters Al Grigaliunas
and Joe Kuzneski, along with
John Jenkins, Gene Sobolewski
and Bob Long. _ '

Juniors Mitch Zalnasky and
Phil Dahar will probably back up
Verkleeren and Howley with help
from Brian Generalovich and
some sophomores.

At. tackle‘ the outlook looks-
less promising. Regulars Bor-
ghetti and John Maczuzak are
gone, while second team tackles
Ron Linaburg and Jim Jones
return. The only experience he
hind those two are senior Den-
nis Bernick and junior Tom
Raymond.

At guard and center no such
problems exist even though no
starters return. Despite the loss of
Ed Adamchik and Jeff Ware at
guard Michelosen still has plenty
of experience with Ray Popp,

Coaches Discuss Teams

In recent years the long-
time rivalry of Pitt, Penn
State and West Virginia has
added another team to the
group, Syracuse. These
four -‘teams -play interlacing
schedules in almost all sports
and are_ sometimes regarded as
The Big.Pour. ’_ - ~_.~ W
“Here isa sizeup-of the prospects

_ Corum makes this statement

even’ though he has 2i,1etter-

men coming back from last
year’s team. ,

Corum _adds, .“There will be
no ﬁrst team as such until the
opening game rolls around. All
positions ’-are wide open. We do
have a good number of experi-

enced players, as well as boys
who are ready- to move up;
therefore it should be easy to
have a contest at every posi-
tion.".

A pre-season size-up of the
Mountaineers shows the team
to be strong at ends and guards
and at running backs, but a
shortage of tackles and a ques-
tion at quarterback could pose

real problems. I

See You A t Intermission . . .

By Wayne Claeren

A’ delightful bit or ﬂuff and fun is being
presented by Beck’s Patio Theatre in their new
musical revue titled “Desdamona Fink Meets
the Son of Stagestruck.”
of material from original revues by Bob Mc-

It is a combination

Cully and Joe Negri, who recently appeared
at the University in “Four Hundred Miles Off
Broadway,” and a similar revue by Don Brock-
ett and Joanne Pasquinelli.

None of the material from “Four Hundred
‘Miles Off Broadway” is repeated though it is
similar in tone and subject. This type of revue

‘ is thoroughly successful in the casual patio _

party atmosphere at Beck’s and is more en-
gaging and exciting than when performed in a
-large formal theatre. _ A

' There are six in the new cast at Beck’s and
an exceptional and highly compatible cast they
are. Indeed, the radiance and enthusiasm of
the three guys and three gals is so contagious
you can’t help but have a good time. Betty
Gillett, Shaaron Lape and Judy O’Dea are the

O’Dea is also the comedienne of the group and
is a real talent in this department.

The male half of the cast is also well staffed.
George Ball has a particularly ﬁne baritone-
voice. and a warm personality. Gene Ray, well
known for his performance in _“Naughty Nif-
ties” and other musicals at the Playhouse, adds
his charm and talent. Bob Trow brings a real
style as an almost silent but very effective
comic. -

The revue uses"the talents of its cast in
various combinations and each has a happy
result. It also moves amazingly fast, keeping
one laugh or song movingright into the next.

The music, some original, some borrowed, is
pleasant and extremely well performed.‘ The

' comedy is sometimes satirical, sometimes spon-

taneous and is always carried off expertly.
All in all, anvexcellent cast, a fast moving

show and a relaxed and pleasing atmosphere

make for a most enjoyable evening.

' Beck’s also provides ﬁrst-rate dinners either

on the patio or in the attractive dining room..

Data Center Gets Science Tapes

The Computing and Data Processing Center at

<3 the University recently received tapes of The

Encyclopedia of Science and‘ Technology from
,McGraw-Hill Book Company.

According to the director of the computer cen-

ter, Dr. William B. Kehl, these tapes constitute

the most complete collection of scientiﬁc and en-

gineering terms in machine-readable form. The‘

Center will transfer the information to magnetic
tape, using equipment‘ provided by a project with
the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the
Department ‘of Defense.

The Center will outline a procedure for ob-
taining the scientiﬁc and technical literature cur-
rently being published, under this Defense proj-

ect. In conjunction'with the Knowledge _Availa— p

bility Program this project provides for tape
transference in computer—compatible form for in-
formation retrieval, automatic abstracting, and
general indexing purposes. ’

With this data from McGraw-Hill, the Center
plans to use the IBM 7090 and 7070 computer

systems to prepare various_ word lists and to ex-
periment in "retrieval. V .

These tapes will encourage linguistic studies
such as a frequency study of current word us-
age in science and technology which would re-
veal how many times any given word appears ‘
in the Encyclopedia. A result of such a program
might be a word book for scientiﬁc writing
corresponding to “The Teacher Word Book of
30,000 Words” by Thorndike and Lorge.

Still another use of these tapes would be an
analysis of the usage and context of words. For
example the researcher may desire to ﬁnd all sen-
tences that have the word “radar” in them. The
computer could extract them. In this analysis the
computer would also detect those sentences rely-
ing on relevant words. ‘

From all of this investigation of frequency
usage, readability, and context, researchers are,
spotting and plotting science—grammar trends.

The University’s Center will receive more than
six million words from the EST tapes.

Owing to ‘space limitations, Museum oiﬁcials explain, it was»
decided to- select only two distinct branches of the ﬁeld and -‘-treat '
each in depth. Bridges and tunnels were chosen as best representa-
tive of the varied interests of the public and as most amenable to
