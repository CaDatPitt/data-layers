May 8, 9 and 10 are the new dates

selected for the presentation of “All:

in a Day,” the 1924 varsity produc-
tion, it was announced after arecent
meeting of officials of the -Cap and
Gown Club. The change from the
previously arra.ng.ed dates, April 3, 4
and 5, was made to allow more time
for preparation and cast and chorus
,.re-hears-als, it was announced by
Coach Walter B. Edmundson.

The -annual dance. in the «Hotel

Schenley ‘following the final. presen-

tatio-n is also being arranged,, for.
The change in date will afford an
ertra month of practice during which
‘the participants in the show will 
hearse at V regular intervals. Here-
tofore, ‘lack of su-ﬁicient time for
preparation made [it necessary for
strenuous rehearsals to ‘be held night-

“The Literary Digest” of February

 

review of an article by :W alter Palm-
er Powers, B. s. E. El. '14, in ‘Radio
News” on the subject f‘Wave-Lengths
ﬁn Everything.” ‘Powers is connect
ed with« the Stevens Institute of
Technology, Hoboken,-‘ N. J. The re-
view in question says in part; - . _

“Did you ever notice odld, shadowy
effects when you were _walking past
a . picket fence_ and looking through
the palingis at another similar fence?
When listening to an ‘organ, did you
ever - hear a queer, throbbing in the
tones?-
the pattern got on ‘watered’ silk, and
why it changes when youl move it
about? These are all “examples of
why physicists call ‘beats,’ due to‘
the interference. of, one set of impul-
ses with another. .The condition re-
quired for their DI‘0d~l.'|lClZlOI1 and the
‘possible uses to -whi-clh they may» be
put are described in ‘Radio News’

Stevens Institute of Technology.)
Beats, says Mr.» Powers, are produced
when two regular periodic impulses
exist  simultaneously, ‘ provided the
periods of the imp-ul'se-s are slightly
different. He uses the Word impulse‘,
he explains, to indicate any sort» of
disturbance."  -_
This is followed by ‘extracts from
Mr.‘Powe~rs’ article with illustrations
which appeared originally ' with the
aticle in “Radio News.” We are in-
debted to‘Frank H. Ramsey, Mines

article. ’ V A V ‘

“Campus Beautiful” RCSu1L;t$-LL
When Nature Plies Her

 

During the last week or so, the
pleasing undulations characteristic of
the Pitt campus seem to have joined
hands with Old Man Winter, thereby
causing the ﬁrst bit of lively senti-
ment among the student body since
last semester's grades came out. The
university has much reason to appre-
ciate this stateof affairs, first be-
cause of the natural beauty it offers,
and secondly because it arouses stu-

learned ‘psychologists, anything that
does that is directly conducive to a
heightened mental activity.

Students interested in art had much
reason to be happy. On all sides
could be seen glittering expanses of
lustrous, shining walks, conforming in
every detail with the graceful curves
and dips, so natural to Pitt’s pictur-
esque topography. Even the steps
leading to the upper buildings had
lost_L their usual choppy ‘and inartistic
appearance, but reflected the shroud-

marred by any break in their long
winding perspective. This condition
made descent thereby very simple
though rather hasty, but as a means
of raising _one’s self to greater
heights, . . . . .. we_ll, to tell the honest
truth, it really wouldn't be worth con-
sidering,

ENGINEERING .

Engineering School Association will
meet in the usual place, 105 Thaw
Hall, and at the accustomed hour,
11:50 o’clock. In addition to the reg-
ular proceedings it is intended that
some very deﬁnite measures be out-
lined and considered which will un-
doubtedly be of important concern to
all engineering students.
invitation is here oﬁered all the Jun-
iors requesting their presence and
their consent to enter into the real
spirit. for which “the Engineering
School Association was founded. All
the actual experience that, it will be
possible to get this semester in con-
nection with the continuance and pro-
motion of the present organization
will be exceedingly proﬁtable to those
men who will be elected to direct and

year. ,
It has been proposed by the Execu-
tive Committee for enactment as a
constitutional By-Law after consider-
able discussion that an Engineering
School manager be elected, who will
control the collection and preparation
of all news of any nature which is
deemed suﬁiciently important by him
for publication in the “Weekly." To
insrre eﬁectiveness and provide for a
broad ‘source of, “news” ‘information,
the manager will havethe assistance
of ﬁve reporters whom will be appoint‘.
edi bythe president, one from each
department. Plans so far for sys-
tematic methods of handling news will
be explained. “
Additional changes’in the Chest
Fund policy will be proposed and it is
possible that a new social committee
will be appointed to act. Students
who feel they have no part in the
‘Chest Fund can largely blame them-
selves as ample opportunity is given
for individual suggestion.

present situation as to law enforce-

only ‘a little while to convince the

the Forest ‘Service was straight——that

whoever else could be shoved oﬁ the
sidewalk, the boys of the Forest Serv-
ice could not. But in the end_ it was
convinced, utterly and completely, and
it is so convinced today., ‘

“I am far from meaning that all the
men in the Forest Service were col-
lege men. By no means; The Service
was full of hunters, trappers, cow
‘punchers; prospectors, men who had
been born and bred in the mountains

‘The question of forest conserva-
tion was then (and still remains) a
great ‘national problem in which the

calls for just as high qualities of cour-

“After more than a century of (de-.,_
bate the people of the United States
have solemnly kenacteda new section
of fundamental law. They adopted

largest vote ever given. They did so
because the poverty, misery, economic
loss, and corruption of government
due to the liquor traffic had convinced"
thiscountry that the general welfare
required it to stop. The question is
whether their action is to stand as
the binding decision of free men, or
whether it is to be repealed in spite‘

, of them by the liquor power." I am

putting that question squarely up to
you_ " I I as .

“You? young men would volunteer
without question if the United States
were threatened with invasion. I_ am
_here to ask your help not to prevent,
for it is too late for that, but to drive
out a body" of invaders who are far
more dangerous to our national life
than any foreign enemy, because they
are, undermining our faith in our own
institutions". ‘

“It was the ‘you
this country in the Revolution. They
did the bulk of the ﬁghting. It was
the young men who preserved this
country in the Civil War. Again they
did the bulk of. the ﬁghting, It was
the young men who savedthe world
inthe Great War. If this nation is
to be taken out from under the heel
of,the bootlegger, and have its self-
respect -restored, it is mainly the
young men who must do it.

“If you knew that men were com-
ing on your campus to cripple your
teams or blacken the name of your
university in order to make money out
of doing so, or -for any other reason
whatsoever, every. last one of you
would beup inarms. The bootleg at-
tack is far more dangerous to the
good name of your university, far
Imore dangerous to every legitimate
interest of college life. " '

“Some of -us‘ are doing our level
best outside of aoademic walls to
make our laws respected. We are
ﬁghting a hard ﬁght, and we are win-
ning, but the victory comes slowly.
Will you give me your help to make
the institutions whose dugy it is to
train leaders, stand right in this ‘ﬁght
for everything that is sound andclean
and ﬁne in America‘?

“There is no’,p1ace in the world
where public opinion is 'more power-
ful than’ on a university campus.
jWhatever the faculty may think about
it, the student community is a self-
governing body. What can be done
and what cannot be done is deter-
mined not simply by faculty rules, but
by student opinion. The student body
makes its own unwritten laws and the
student body obeys them. _ g

“The question of law enforcement
among students is, therefore, neither
a question of faculty edicts nor police
regulation. It is‘ a question primar-
ily for the students themselves. , If
they decide for the bootlegger, the
boolegger will hang on for a time. If
they decide against him, he will ‘dis-
appear ‘quick. It is up to you.

the tradition of the past, and are
bound by it. You are not. You rep-
resent the new day. You are the
storm troops in every advance. The.
world gets better because young men
fail to staybehind with their elders
when old men cling to what is wrong.

DEFEAT ALLEGHENY

Pitt’s swimlning team chalked up
another ‘victory on Washington's
Birthday when it, outclassed‘ Alle-
gheny-College 50 t.o‘20. In the famil-
iar surroundings of Tr-ee’s pool and
with the hearty Acheers of a large body
‘of loyal Pitt rooters to spur them on,
the University ‘natators showed their
-real worth, and did not allow the men
from Meadville a ﬁrst place. Steele,
as usual, was high point scorer for
Pitt, winning the 100‘and the 40-yard
free style events, taking third in the
40-yard back-stroke, and swimming on
the winning relay team. Only once
did the visitors’ threaten; to break into.
the first place column, when Hill gave
Butts. a hard, race in the 220-yard free
style. Hill and Vvright, a brother of
the famous Wright of the Erie “Y”,
bore the brunt of the Allegheny at-
tack. .

In ‘an exhibition plunge, Gluck, Pitt
Freshman star, traversed the length
of the po'o1,~a d.istance of 60 feet, in
52 seconds. This is a record plunge,
but unfortunately does not count as
school records must be made in com-
