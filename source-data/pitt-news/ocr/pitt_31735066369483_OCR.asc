Former Aide to Sadat SaysWars Could Not Win

By PATRICIA LANGFORD
Pitt News Staff Writer

Menahem Mllson, a former aide
to Anwar Sadat, said the Egyptian
president realized throughout the
Jerusalem peace talks that the
Penninsula of Sinai could not be
won by means of war. .

Milson, who served with the
Egyptian President through his trip
to Jerusalem, addressed a group of
students at Point Park College,
downtown. '

According to Milson, the Soviet
Union, . without strong relations
with Israel, does not have the
necessary political leverage , to
intervene in the Mideast. Only a
nation maintaining friendly relat-
ions with Israel could persuade its
leaders to make that concession, he

said. Instead, he added, Sadat
sought to gain the good will of the
United States.

“In order to do that he realized
that he must abandon publicly the
course of war, otherwise the United
States would not give him the full
support which he required,”
Milson said.

Milsonsaid Sadat had tomake an
“ideological change, to modify that
ideology which negates the right of
Israel into another ideology, which
perhaps is not very happy with
Israel’s existence, but accepts it as
a fact of the political world of today,
a reality which has to ‘ be
accepted.”

According to Milson, Israel also
had to make great sacriﬁces in its
efforts to achieve peace. Israel was

SGB Votes T
GovernanceA|location

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

An Allocations Committee re-
commendation that would fund
approximately $31,000 to the
Student Government Board's seven
governance groups next year was
rejected by the board Wednesday.

The proposal was defeated by a
5-1 margin.

Dissenting SGB member Helen
Gianella said she believed it was
not fair to leaders of the groups to
delay approval of the budget.

“I don’t think we should make
governance group leaders wait
longer either,” said SGB member

' Kim Watterson, “but I think we

have ther responsibility to take
time in allocating the money

, fairly. ” .

The SGB was expected to meet
"last night with the Allocations
Committee to discuss reasons for
their rejection.

proposals, ﬁve of the governance
‘groups would have increased
funding for the ﬁscal 1979-80. .

Pitt News Staff Writer

“I think it’s quite unfair,”
former Black Action Society chair-
man Mark Holloway said of the
Student Government Board Alloca-
tions Committee’s proposal to cut
$4,248 from that governance
group’s budget over last year's
funding.

a “If in fact, Allocations (Commit-
tee) is equally distributing that
money, why are the lnter-Frater-
nity Council, Panhellenic Associa-
tion and Greek‘Week taking up 45
percent (of the governance group
funding)?”

_ BAS, which last year received
$10,794 from Student Government,
saw’ a $23,095 request for ﬁscal

Allocations Committee.

“I can’t ju'stify all the recom-
mendations (of Allocations Com-
mittee) because I wasn’t in
agreement with all the recom-
mendations,” said SGB President
Stan Galanski.

The SGB Wednesday voted to
reject a first submission by the

"committee, which called for ﬁve of

the seven governance groups
enjoying an increase ‘in funding,
with the Greeks (IFC, Panhell and
Greek Week) collecting $15,505 of
the $30,772 set aside by the
Allocations Committee for the
governance groups.

“We are deﬁnitely going to

appeal this all the way to the ~

board,” Holloway said after

think the board will let that ‘(the
decrease) happen.” .
Allocations Committee chairman
Mike Seitz said Student Goven-
ment could not afford to fund all
the programs BAS had requested.
Aside from telephone service,
BAS’ request was based entirely on‘

‘programming. .

“We go over the budgets and
pick out the good and bad things,”
Seitz said yesterday. “BAS
programs were all major programs
and we couldn’t afford to pay for all
of them.

“We can’t afford to spend all
that money on all those programs.
That’s the main reason (for the
budget cut). The Pitt Union
Program Council is responsible for

campus-—-except for the major
weeks (Greek Week, Engineers’
Week and Black Week).” ‘

Holloway has already made it
clear his group will not work with
the council,‘ an organization the
BAS has opposed since council’—s
inception last spring.

“The credibility of PUPC is no
more,” Holloway told the SGB at
Wednesday’s meeting.

The SGB is scheduled to vote on
a second submission by the
committee next Wednesday and
Holloway said he is conﬁdent the
BAS will receive more money.

If not, however, he said he is
prepared to go through all
“university channels” before‘ giv-

Council Votes In Diagnostic Testing

By TERESA SOKOL

Pitt News Staff Writer

A resolution to administer a

mandatory diagnostic writing exam
to incoming freshmen and transfer
students was passed unanimously
by the College of Arts and Sciences

Council Wednesday.

The proposed exam would
distinguish writing and reading
skill levels and serve as a
mechanism to locate students
needing remedial work in those
areas.

Students diagnosed as such
would be required to enroll in “a
course in basic reading and writing
or a two—term sequence in English
compostion,” according to the
re solution. K .

“These courses,” said David
Bartholomae of the English de-
partment, “are not for ‘bad’
students but for students with
writing problems who need more

Studerits transferring to Oakland
from a branch campus or another
college or university also would be
required to enroll in the courses if
they have not previously taken and
passed a college level course in
English writing with a grade of B’
or better.

Satisfactory completion of a basic
reading and writing sequence also
will be required for graduation.
Those students must also meet the
requirement by the end of their
second year of residence or when
they have compiled 60 credits at
Oakland according to the resolu-
tion.

The council also discussed grade
options for the remedial courses,
opting to use standard ‘A,’ ‘B’ and
‘C’ grades as well as incomplete
and credit/ no entry marks.

Students earning a ‘D’ or ‘F’ in
the courses would be required to
repeat the course, the resolution
states.

In regard to an incomplete grade,
“(it) signifies that the student has
completed all the work for. the

‘ course without having developed

an adequate level of proficiency,”
the resolution ‘reads. “Such
students would be required to take
basic writing in the following term;
successful completion of that
course with a grade of ‘C’ or better

would lead to replacement of the ‘I’ .

grade with the grade earned in
basic writing.”
“This program puts a tremen-
dous obligation on the English
department,” said council member
Ian Campbell, “and any failure (to
meet thisiobligation) would be a
disservice. ’ ’
The resolution now moves to the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences for
approval.

University Senate Discusses School Desegregation

/Continued from page 1)

“Any plans the university can
come up With to assist us are

appreciated, ” Walker said.

The panelists stressed the
importance of continued research
in the area and the cooperative use
of university facilities. Engel cited
a successful program instituted by
the Minneapolis school board.

According to Engel, the success
of .the Minneapolis plan to
desegregate the schools was due to
conditions provided by the follow-
ing factors: consistent administra-
tive leadership, generally positive

board support, strong reinforce- ~

\   of Hope

  On Homefront

Students beleaguered with ever-increasing tuition
and fees’ should be thrilled to learn that ‘one
Allegheny County legislator has found a plan of
salvation, which could curb the spiralling cost of
higher education. State Rep. Ivan" Itkin, D-Green-
field, is thinking of introducing a tuition credit plan
that would help keep tuition stable. Q ’

Under the credit plan, state government. would

_ directly underwrite the tuition of every Penn-

sylvanian attending Pitt and other state-related
universities. Each student would receive a $50 credit
on their invoice each term. The crux of the proposal
that must be seen to determine its true merit also
*must still be decided. That is the method of funding
the tax credit plan. A _

Itkin proposes that the‘money from the credit
scheme be in addition to Gov. Richard Thornburgh’s
proposed appropriation for the state-related in-
stitutions. This might be the best way to fund the
program, but also an impossible way. With Pennsyl-
vania in a tight financial situation, no funds are likely

A to come from Harrisburg to increase aid to resident
e college students. ’

The second avenue for funding the proposal could
prove to be a domestic nightmare for Pitt students.
Some have suggested that money for the credit
program be taken from appropriations to Pitt—an
idea that would in the end defeat the purpose of the
credits. If the legislature reduces appropriations for
the state—related universities to fund tuition credits;

Pitt would feel a strong budget .pinch that it would,

undoubtedly alleviate by raising tuition. In the

, probable event that Pitt raised tuition more than $50
a term, the credit scheme would serve no purpose at

all. » J

\ One alternative method of funding the credit
program that would avoid the pitfall of cutting ap-
propriations to underwrite students’ tuition has been
suggested by Itkin. He has said it might be possible
to amend the appropriations bill to institute a plan,
which would give students a tuition credit only if the
university increased tuition. I

This proposal seemsdthe best possible way to fund
any tuition credits because it would deter the univer-

sity from increasing tuition. If the board of trustees

would increase tuition when this scheme was in
effect, money would be taken from Pitt’s state ap-
propriation to pay students credits to offset the in-
crease. Any tuition increase would cut the univer-
sity’~s own throat because it would also reduce Pitt’s
operating budget by the amount to be gained from an

increase.

In principle, we endorse tuition credits when the
legislature finds some realistic way to fund them.
Merely doling out more money to the university every

year can no longer be considered the answer to Pitt’s
budget problems. Whenever Pitt‘ receives appro-
priations, it arbitrarily decides what the money does
not meet its requests and passes the burden to stu-
dents by increasing tuition.

A tuition credit plan that would punish Pitt for any
tuition increase by reducing the university’s ap-
propriation is the only answer to the spiralling cost of
education here. As long as the administration suffers
no penalty when _it increases tuition, it will feel no
qualms when charging students more money. When
it stands to lose substantially if it increases tuition,
the administration will finally look to cutting the size
of the burgeoning bureaucracy and the flow of ad-
ministrative prerogatives that Pitt students are forced

to support financially.

Quotes Mar Reports on Daniel Speech to Honors Council

Iwas pleased to see that The Pitt
i News “opinion” column shares
some of the concerns I raised in the

. talk I‘ gave at the Inter-Honorary

Council banquet. There are,
however, several items which I feel
must be clariﬁed, including the
accuracy of some of the /quotes
attributed to me in the March 19
The Pitt News. ,
Risking’ the possible loss of
dynamic delivery but being con-
cerned" with accuracy, I had
decided to read from my manu-

*:_‘script. Thus, it was with much

consternation that I read the
misquotes attributed to me. I
changed my initial decision to not
write a letter to the editor after I
read the ‘editorial in the March 21
The Pitt News. The editorial,
“Flight From Humanism,” is
based, in part, on . the initial
misquotes, and it mistakenly notes
me as “dean” of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences.

I spoke on the topic “Academic

Honors and Responsibilities,” and A

not, as The Pitt News reported,
“...-the need for humanism in an
intellectual approach to social

problems.” I raisedwa question
concerning what we ought to
expect from intellectually dis-

tinguished students.

In offering my tentative answers
ot the question. I stressed the need
for the simultaneous development
of the affective and the cognitive
domain. Quoting Gregory Bateson,
I argued that, “Mere purposive
rationality, unaided by such phen-
omena as art, religion, dream and
the like, is necessarily pathogenic
and destructive of life.” I used
remarks from Ererson, Einstein,
Sowande and Darwin to support
this claim.

I repeatedly stated that we
should honor outstanding intellec-
tual development, but that we
ought not honor “...the conversion
of, young people into sterile
mach-ines—one step short of
human computers and‘ divorced
from their sensuous humanity. We
need not honor those photographic
minds that can simply give a
verbatim replay of a professor’s
notes and text materials but have
no more sense to useisuch skills for
the purposes of war than peace.”

Somehow, these remarks were
signiﬁcantly altered in the March
19 and 21 The Pitt News. _

After calling for distinguished
intellectual development accom-
panied by moral, emotional and, in
general, ' affective development, I
held the opinion that we ought to
expect such capable people to make
major contributions to the resolu-
tion of social problems. Speciﬁ-
cally, I asked members of the
Inter-Honorary Council to address
the world-wide energy crisis, the
equitable distribution of food, the
elimination of cancer, the potential
hazards of genetic research, and
the conquest of hate reactions to
“Arab,” “Jew” and “black.”

I asked the intellectually talented
to “...provide means for a more
equitable \ distribution of resources
such that we don’t have people,
living within walking distance of
this university, who don’t have
housing ﬁt for human habitation.”
The Pitt News erroneously indicat-

ed a reference to “...people within‘

the University. without decent
housing.”

I share your frightening concern

with the possibility’ of “narrow
minded” people holding responsi-

differs somewhat fromiyours in that
1, hope for widespread efforts

toward a synergistic development

of both our affective and cognitive
domains.

Stated differently, we must not
only focus on how the world is. We

must also focus on how the world

our efforts to increase objectivity

eventually becomes the servant of

Billions for Peace Burden

After reading your editorial
entitled “No Price for Peace Too
High,” I cannot help put comment

on the billions of United States‘

funds being spent_to achieve peace.
_ The public was led to believe that
President'Carter’s attempts at a
peace settlement were that of a
humanitarian, I seeking world
peace. The fact that the United
States was paying for the peace
settlement was exposed only after
Israel and Egypt agreed to the
settlement, too late to cancel the
whole thing, too latefor’ taxpayers
to gripe.

It is ridiculous that the United
States is “buying peace” from
these two countries when, _as you

state, the Israelis are using the L

funds to “add new weapons to their
arsenals." This does not sound
like a peaceful activity. The

Congress, Senate and the Presi-‘

dent should be aware that there are
programs here in the United-States
which could greatly beneﬁt from
billions of dollars, instead of giving
it away to oil-rich countries. we
the working people must struggle
in ‘every day existence on pot-hole

ridden roads, buying over-priced

food, paying far too much for gas,
and paying outrageous city, state
and federal taxes. ’ There is a
question of priorities here, as well
as unanswerable questions. Will
billions of dollars buy peace? Can
the United States currently running
on deﬁcit spending,
patronize the Mideast with money?

I ﬁnd it difﬁcult to believe there
will be peace in the Mideast
because of a ﬁnancial settlement
from an outside source. There is
more to peace than ‘money. The
power and border differences have
not been truly settled. The only
incentive here for peace is money.

Carter can easily commit funds
for “peace,” but we the working
class are the people who suffer
seeing such a large percentage of
our salaries going to taxes,
especially federal taxes.

‘Time will tell whether the
billions of dollars have bought
peace, but will we be able to
survive the excessive taxes in our
attempt to merely “break-even?"

DePaul Loves Final Four Recognition, Hoopla I

By The Associated Press

SALT LAKE ClTY——Coach Jud
Heathcote and his Michigan State
Spartans ﬂed to Salt Lake City a
day early to escape the hoopla and
attention that comes with being in
the NCAA’s basketball Final Four,
but Ray Meyer is loving every
minute of it. ,

“We’ve never been to the Final
Four, as far as I know,” the
popular DePaul coach said this
week from his ofﬁce in Chicago.
“But I’ve never experienced
anything like this before. I’ve had

*people come into the house at 8

a.m.., follow me around all day to
see what I do. ‘

“It’s been an experience, and I
don’t know quite how to accept it.
But when you consider the

alternative, I guess it’s OK. No

one, including myself, ever expect-
ed anything of DePaul this year.
We lost four out of the top six
gballplayers and we just changed
our whole style, from being a slow
power club to a quick ball.”

De Paul, Indiana State and Penn
were all expected in Salt Lake
yesterday to begin preparations for
Saturday's semiﬁnal games, which
match Michigan State and Penn at
2:45 p.m. and DePaul and Indiana
State at 5:15 p.m. But Michigan
State,»-the tournament favorite, hit
town Wednesday and went into
seclusion.

“We are out here early to get
away from all the distractions
surfacing at this time,” Heathcote
said in a telephone interview with

k the other three coaches. Heathcote

has closed his practices and

 

 

declared his players off-limits to
the media until after their Saturday
game.

Although he hates being cast as
the favorite, Heathcote says
Michigan State, led by playmaker
Earvin Johnson and high-scoring
forward Greg Kelser, has the best
players.

“I honestly think we’re the best
team,” he said. “But in a
tournament it’s not how good you
are, it’s how good you’re playing. I
can’t believe Indiana State can
come into here with a 32-0 record,
having been ranked No. 1 for six or
seven weeks, and suddenly we end
up being the favorite. I can’t
understand that.”

Indiana State probably doesn’t
understand it either, but the
much-maligned Sycamores are

getting used to it. They’ve been
criticized all year as a one-man
team with a patsy schedule, and
their ﬁrst-year head coach, Bill
Hodges, recently received a letter
from North Carolina’s Dean Smith
addressed to “Bill Hansen.”

‘ ‘I’m sure it was just a secretarial
error,” Hodges said. “It isn’t easy
for a ﬁrst-year coach to receive the
recognition that I’ve received and
still maintain the low proﬁle I had
before.” 5

Penn Coach Bob Weinhauer said
the Quakers, who played almost
strictly a man-to-man defense
during the regular season, will
probably go to a zone against the
Michigan State fast break.

“The thing that’s important for
us to remember is they are not a
two-man team,” he said.

Evans Knows Pressure 

By JEFF DUROSKO

Freshman gymnast Roxanne
Evans is preparing to compete in
the Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women national
championships next weekend at
Penn State.

-This is not herﬁrst competition
at the national level. She
participated in the United States
Gymnastics Federation’s senior
championships in Arizona in 1977.
Evans just missed placing in the
top,36 out of 187 competitors in
what she called “a good meet” for
her. _ ,

In this national competition,
however, Evans will be competing
in a different situation; along with
her Pantherette teammates whom
she said have become very close
since the season began.

“I’m really glad the whole team
made it,” she said. “Everybody’s
really psyched.”

Evans said competing with a
college team is very different than
any previous gymnastics exper-
ience she has had.

“When you’re out there, every-
one is cheering you on,” she said,
“and you know that they really
mean it. I found this especially
true at regionals.”

Evans was sixth in the uneven
bars at regionals, which earned her
a spot on the all-East team. She
said the bars are her favorite and
strongest event.

Evans, who was also recruited by
several small colleges came to Pitt
for one big reason: coach Donna
DeMarino Sanft.

“Donna made me feel really
welcome,” she said. “The other
schools showed a little bit of
interest, but nothing like the
interest Donna showed.”

Sanft said she knew Evans‘ would
ﬁt in with the rest of the Pitt team,
which is an important part of her
recruiting process.

“I knew Roxanne hadn’t peaked
mentally or physically,” said Sanft.
“aild that was exciting to me. I
don’t like to get a_ girl in here who
either thinks that she has peaked or
actually has. It’s no good for
morale.” '

Evans said Sanft and assistant
coach Ed Swerlo are a big help
before she competes in each event.

“Donna and Eddie tell me what
to do during each event before I
begin and it helps me a lot in my
mental preparation,” she said.

  Hurdles No Obstacle to Record-Holder Candy Young

Nothing like a world record holder to add a little

Alfreda Goff.

“As far as I know, our invitational is the only one

Last year, a 15-year-old sophomore from Beaver
Falls entered‘ the University of Pittsburgh’s annual
high school Indoor/Invitational track meet. ,

Her name:. Candy Young. The events: 50-yard
hurdles, 220-yard dash and 880-yard relay. While
Beaver Falls did nottset any records in the relay,
Young outclassed a vast field of schoolgirl com-
petitors by winning her individual events in the Field
House and setting a meet record time. Young had
been favored in the hurdles; after all, she had set the

high school girls’ national record in the outdoor 80-
' yard event as a freshman.

Young breezed through trials, semis and the final

in hurdles. When finished, she set a record of 6.4

v which has not yet been surpassed by either high

school or college women at the Field House. (In all
fairness to collegiate women, however, it should be
noted women’s high schoolhurdles are three inches
shorter than the 33-inch high college hurdles.)

At the time, her accomplishment was about as im-
pressive as any coach or athlete could wish, but
Young was just getting started. ‘

Several weeks ago at the Amateur Athletic Union

Oh the RUN

By MARIA SCIULLO

 

Indoor National championships, Young defeated
previous world record holder Debi LaP1ante in the
ﬁnals of the 60-yard hurdles and also tied her own
world record of 7.5. Earlier that day, she had set the
record in a trial heat (60-yard hurdles are’ 33-inches
high).

Less than two weeks ago, Young competed for the
United States against the Soviet Union and came
away with yet another impressive victory.

So much has been accomplished by Young since

her appearance at the Pitt Invitational last year, and

tomorrow she returns to the Field House to defend
her titles.

Fifty-six schools from the Tri-state area will par-
ticipate in the meet, the fourth annual.

-“I think this meet will be one of the finest collec-
tions of talents you’ll find in the Tri-State area,” said
Pitt women’s track coach and meet coordinator

of it’s kind for high school women in that it brings
together athletes from such a wide area,” Goff said.
“In fact, we’ve had schools from as far away as_New
Jersey and Maryland getting in touch and asking if
they can compete in it. I think for now that would be
a bit much, though. ” *

Over nine women currently competing for Pitt
were once participants in the meet. High school
women run basically the same events as in college,
except for the high school triple jump, college inter-
mediate hurdles and three—mile run.

Goff looks for Western Pennsylvania Inter-
scholastic League (WPIAL) cross-country champion
Bethel Park to be strong in many events tomorrow,
although a team score will not be kept. Individuals
of note include two-miler Shannon Cline of Upper
Arlington (Ohio) High School and Bethel Park shot
putter Mary Majesick. Favored in the two-mile relay
is Perkiomen Valley (Pa.) High School.

Field events will begin tomorrow morning at 9
a.m. with running to begin at 10:30. Admittance
charge is $1, but students with I.D.’s may watch the
meet for free. - '

Mile ReIay’s Shippen Aiming for 46-Second Barrier

A By KAREN KADILAK

Pitt News Staff Writer

Panther Larry Shippen considers «

himself “a good sprinter," but
believes he can become even
better.

“Last year, I ran the 440-yard
run in 47.3 seconds,” explained
Shippen, anticipating the start of
the outdoor track season. “This
year, I'd like to run it in 46
seconds.”

“My dad was a really good
sprinter and he’s always instilling

in me that 46 is sort of a magic
mark,” Shippen said. “Fortyseven
or 48 is average or even good for a
collegiate sprinter. But 46
separates the men from the boys.”

Shippen, a junior from the
Philadelphia area, will get his first
chance to break the~46 second
barrier when Pitt travels to
Richmond to compete in the
Virginia Invitational.

It will be the Panthers’ first
outdoor meet of the season.

‘‘I’m looking forward to it,”

Valley Gains PIAA Final,

Stuns Beaver Falls, 66-60

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH-——Bill Varner, a_

’ 6-foot-6 senior, scored 20 points,

grabbed 16 rebounds, and helped
turn back a late rally to lead Valley
to a 66-60 victory over Beaver Falls
last night in the semifinals of the
PIAA Class AAA basketball play-
offs.

Valley, which placed ﬁfth behind
ﬁrst-place Beaver Falls in the
District 7 tournament, will play for
the PIAA title here Saturday night
against the finalist from the East.

Vamer, a highly-recruited sen-

Coach Resigns
By The Associated Press
«UCLA’s head basketball
coach Gary. Cunningham
resigned yesterday, stressing
his desire to spend more time
with his family. UCLA was
ousted from ‘the NCAA
tournament by the surprising
DePaul Blue Demons, 95-91
last Saturday in the Western
Regional Championship
game. I
Cunningham took control
of the Bruins following the
1976-77 season when Gene
‘ Bartow resigned. Bartow had
replaced the highly success-
ful John Wooden, who won
10 NCAA‘ titles while at
UCLA. The Bruins have
failed to win a championship
since 1974-75,. Wooden’s last
year.

ior, scored 13 of his 20 points in the
second half. He had six of them in
the last four minutes after Beaver
Falls had battled back to gain a
54-54 tie. »

Senior guard Gosby “Goose”
Pryor added 18 points for Valley,
which will take a 27-5 record into
the championship.

Previously once-beaten Beaver
Falls was toppedby 6-foot-3 senior
Damon Bryant with 22_ points.
Dwight Collins, a muscular 6-foot-2
junior, had 18 points and" led his
team’s second-half comeback.

Valley was on top 52-46 into the
ﬁnal quarter, but Collins went to
work for Beaver Falls.

Although be sustained his fourth
personal foul late in the third
quarter, Collins scored six straight
points in the fourth quarter to give
Beaver Falls a 54-54 tie with 3:55
left in the game.

Shippen said about'the upcoming
season. “I have my personal goal
(improving in the 440), plus
outdoor track is always fun.

“Our schedule being the way it
is, the team has to stay for part of
the spring session. Some guys
take classes, some don’t. But
anyway, we hang around together
because there aren’t so many
people around. We build a lot of
team unity that way.”

Unity is important to Shippen.
The junior economics major uses
the word frequently when discuss-
ing the track team.

“It’s really important that you
have that unity,” Shippen said.
“For example, when I’m running
in the mile relay, it’s important that
I know what the other guys are
going to do; what the second or
third man on the team can do. That

way, we can run’ better and def

better as a team.”

Shippen said he “can’t wait to
compete outdoors.‘

“I’m really looking forward to
the Penn Relays because all my
family and friend will be there.

“Track’s a big thing in my
family,” Shippen added. “’my
father probably could have ran in
college, and my sister Cheryl
triple-jumps and runs the 100-yard
dash. .She’s broken a few records
at Lower Merion High School. I
think she's going to Maryland next
year.”

Shippen was also recruited by
Maryland, but fortunately for the
Pitt mile relay team, he will be
wearing blue and gold in Virginia.
