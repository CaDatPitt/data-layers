Astronomers Offer
Wagman Support

Astronomers throughout the United States have pledged
their support to Dr. Nicholas Wagman, director of the
Allegheny Observatory, in an effort to preserve that insti-
tution. .' ‘

. ‘ Chancellor, Edward H. Litchﬁeld announced last week
that the observatory would be “phased out of operation.”
In an economy move, the Chancellor insisted that the 9b-
servatory’s equipment was obso-
lete and that its research—pri-

servation-_vvas not related to the

University Drops 1 50 Employees;
Academic Program, Faculty Not Hit

By LARRY BERNFHJD

More than 150 University workers have been dropped from the payroll in an at-
tempt to alleviate current ﬁnancial difficulties. The conservation move entails large-scale
budget cutbacks in the physical overhead as Well as in personnel, a highly placed spokes-

man said on Wednesday.

“There are no cuts in the faculty and noneiin the academic program—at least none

that count,’j* he explained.

Five thousand people are on the total University payroll. Most of those whose positions have
been terminated are already gone, and have been going over the past couple months, according to the

Dorm, Health
Fees Change

An increase in housing
charges and a decrease in
the student -health fee. will
be put into effect this fall,
announced Dr.'Alan C. Ran-
kin, vice-chancellor of stu-
dent and general affairs, and

Lawrence L. Monnett, vice-chan-
cellor for Business Affairs.

Dormitory rates will be raised
$10 per trimester, while the stu-
dent health fee will be lowered
from $26.50 to $26 per year.

“The reason for the adjust-
ment in dorm rates is rising costs.
The average costs go up from
two and a half to three per cent
a year. This is the ﬁrst increase
in Pitt dorm rates in two years,”
stated Dr. Rankin.

The new rates represent an in-
crease of five per cent for un-
dergraduates and four per cent
for graduate students, which is
a cost of $10 in both cases.

However, no increases in tui-
tion will be forthcoming, nor will
food service charges be changed.

Dr. Rankin was to‘ make the
official announcement of student
rate changes at a meeting of the
Student Affairs Committee.

L

, spokesman.

Changes have been evidenced in ‘the areas of development, main-
tenance, clerical services and the chancellor’s activities. The biggest
change has come in the office of the chancellor. The’ curtailments
here aﬁect travel, entertainment and personnel. The official use of

, his own residence, which has been the subject of controversy among

Allegheny County officials who want to tax it, will be cut back to
an absolute  ’ '

The spokesman indicated that the chancellor intends to spend
more time than he has on the problems of University costs and less
on the development of new programs. He described the Chancellor
as feeling that the University is in a period of “stabilization,” that

its promotional activities over the past ten years have given it the .

momentum it needs to keep it moving‘.
The Chancellor and members of the administrative committee

have gone over thousands of items in every department. Public Re- _

lations Director Joe Colangelo ‘documented the results of a concrete
cut-back in his department. “We have lost ﬁve people including sec-
retaries,” he said. “The public relations office here encompasses what
at another University would be two offices, Public Relations and
Publications. It sometimes sounds like we have a lot of people here,
but the pamphlets, bulletins and other publications extend far beyond
what the title of the office would indicate. —

The maintenance cuts, the spokesman said, will mean that “we
will not wash our windows as often, or get our desks dusted as often,
or have the lawn cut as often, or plant as many lovely ﬂowers as
we once did.”

Some have expressed concern that the Chancellor has been overly
concerned with the businessman’s view of the University. The spokes-
man commented that “this situation clearly shows that the Chancellor
is concerned with education rather than business.” \

“There has been no affect on the quality of the education as
a result of the cuts,” he noted.

In a December letter to the faculty appearing in the faculty news,
the Chancellor had indicated the general problem confronting the
administration and the general method of solution. “Our immediate
thought, when the likehood of a deﬁcitrbecame clear, was not to let
it happen, to recover these funds in a single, hopefully brief period
of economy before the end of the current ﬁscal year on July 31, 1965.
Such a cost-cutting program has now been instituted."

The University's action, how- '
ever, has produced a deluge of
sympathetic letters and tele-
phone calls to Professor Wagman.
Dr. K. A. Str.and, scientiﬁc di-D
rector of the U.S. Naval Observa-
tory in Washington, D. C., has
assured Dr. Wagman that the in-
ﬂuential American Association
for the Advancement of Science

Piersall Comments

(AAAS) is concerned, and that

AAAS representatives may visit

Pittsburgh to review the situa-

tion.
« Further correspondence has
been received from Dr. Gerald
Clements, former director of the
U. S. Naval Observatory; Dr.
Lawrence Frederick, director of
the University of Virginia’s Ob-
servatory, and Dr. Peter Van de
Comp or the Swarthmore Obser-
vatory.

Also, Dr. Frank Edrnondson,

PIERSALL, Wednesday’s Midday speaker, at the eoiree

day’s SU

  

on Baseball Career
Midday Program

By J. D. GLASSER medium, pointing to his‘ oi!-sea-
‘Tm the greatest diaper son jobs as salesman and pro-

changer in the history of
baseball,” Los Angeles out-
ﬁelder Jimmy Piersall des-
cribed himself at Wednes-
day's Midday lecture. '

Piersall was referring, of course
to his nine children. Among the
anecdotes he related, in typical
after-dinner manner, was his ad-
vice to Yogi Berra when the for-
mer Yankee manager was await-
ing the return of his wife from
the hospital with their first baby.
Piersall described the process of
changing a diaper for Berra in
terms of a baseball diamond,
adding, “The only difference is,
when it rains in this game there’s
no postponement.”

Although most of the time he
told stories about other well
known ballplayers, Piersall made
a few points in a serious vein.
He stressed the importance of

‘sewn: -yonrselt-in m9rs=..*han one  

moter. No matter what you do
you must produce for your em-

« ployer, whether he is a coach or

a teacher, he remonstrated.

One thing he has noticed both
on and off the ball ﬁeld is that
those who try to show up the
mistakes of others are usually
not successful themselves.

This realization was a great
help to him when he suffered a
nervous breakdown. He turned
the taunts of other players to his
advantage in becoming a better
player: the more he was insult-
ed, the better he played.

  Symphony

Previewed I

Guest conductor John Prit-
chard in putting together
this week's program for the
Pittsburgh Symphony will
give an interesting study in
diversity and uniformity for
his fourth and final concert
at Syria Mosque He presents a
uniﬁed program of essentially
impressionist music.

“The Mozart Divertimento in
B-ﬂat” was written to be played
in the garden at tea-time while
people chatted pleasantly. Thus,
Mozart here was not concerned
with melodic development but
rather with tonal texture and
color.

Likewise in the “Three Noc-
turnes” the composer is primarily
concerned with creating a mood
through orchestral and vocal tex-
tures and colors. Pritchard is
once again in his element, as he
is for the “Britten Variations,"
the primary interest of which is
tonal texture and color. This ac-
counts for the particularly in--
teresting writing for the brass
during which Pritchard will show
his true ability as a conductor if
he succeeds in keeping it within"
the bounds of textural reason-
ability.

Betters Expect Girls to Win

Heavy betting on Chi
Omega sorority, originally
installed as a six-point fav-
orite over Circle K, has
forced the odds - makers to
raise the spread on the game
_to 13 points, a Las Vegas
source disclosed today.

The football game between the
Chi Omega Owls and the Circle
K Chargers will be played Satur-
day afternoon at 1 p.m. at Trees
Field. Tickets for the game are
50 cents, and they may be pur-
chased from any member of Cir-
cle K or Chi Omega. Circle K
will provide rides to the football
game. Cars will leave from the
front of the Student Union and
from the Quadrangle.

“This game shouldn't give us
too much trouble,” Chi O captain
Barbara Beam said, lifting 200
pound barbells over her head.
“After all, Circle K is just a
bunch of‘boys. I don’t see how
they can possibly contain our
attack.” .

Grads Get Grants

The University has received a
$29,108 National Science Foun-
dation grant for ﬁve graduate
traineeships in engineering. The
current grant matches on equal
gift received last year for grad-
uate traineeships.

A new grant for $56,938 was
also received. It will provide
funds for all graduate trainee-

ships in engineering and the nat-"’

ural sciences. T
- The grants will be. adminis-
tered under the direction of Dr.

Richard McCoy, professor of’

chemistry and associate dean of
the Division of the Natural Sci-

charity game, expressed his con-
cern at the size of the Chi 0's
line. “We don’t have anything
like that,” he said, shaking his
head. “All we have in the front
line is Dennis ‘Chicken’ Bergman
and he wanted to quit the team
after he saw Barbara Beam lift
weights.

“Our best chance,” continued
Mazzola, “is our secret weapon,
“Adonis.” Mazzola was referring
to Circle K’s star halfback Mar-
vin “Adonis” Zelkowitz. “That
kid is a natural athlete,” Mazzola
continued, “but it’s hard to keep
those girls away from him. Be-
cause of that, he might be our
best asset if he sits on the bench.”

“Mazzo1a’s just looking for a

. way out,” Adonis explained, run-

ning his ﬁngers through his long
dark hair. But asked if he
thought Mazzola could coach.

éitonsolidation  

  

Since Chancellor Edward Litchﬁeld has arrived on the scene, the University of
Pittsburgh has glittered with national comment because of his grandiose strides to raise
the level of this institution. What once seem ed an undergraduate extension of Allderdice

' High School is now sparked by three circular towers for a primarily resident student body

and such_ impressive acade

phy Program.

mic programs as the Space Research Center and Oceanogra-

The academic level of the institution has made a signiﬁcant jump, in the quality
of both faculty and students, aside from physical expansion itself. But in all these areas
of growth, the glitter -has not been free. Expansion has bounded forth, regardless of ris-
ing costs and competitive prices for desired professors, and the ﬁnancial backing has not

been coming in proportion. Even the depend able state allocation did not come through at
1 its expected ﬁgure this year.

The University, as news reports have repeated over the past couple months, is
having ﬁnancial difficulty. Chancellor Litch ﬁeld, in short, is in a pickle. He has a beau-
tiful shell here, an impressive prospectus, but it seems that the school has ﬁnally crossed
that narrow line between growth and extravagance, and it has to pay for it—now.

It is most difficult not to hit a tender spot when you're cutting expenses and
almost impossible in a University not to cut something that someone will label academic.
But according to all reports, the Chancellor is fiercely holding on to the academic re-
sources and is trying to cut from areas that will affect the least number Of Students and
faculty, for instance—maintenance and his own office expenses. Similarly he has’ not
brought many new people into administrative positions: Director of Student Aid Jack
Critchﬁeld took a co-position as head of Admissions when Everard Pinneo left; Dr. War-
ren Hill moved up to assume Dr. Roy Heath ’s position as Director of the'Counseling Ser-
ice; Dean Putnam Jones is doubling as Dean of the Graduate Faculties and the under-
graduate School of Liberal Arts; and so on in several other jobs.

Harsh necessity has forced both the Chancellor and the. Board of Trustees to
realize that it is time for the University to consolidate, not to expand. Such a severe cut
is a hard way to learn but a discipline that might catch us from losing our foothold.

Biggest Game

 N CUIC3’ uChS

The Chi Omega Owls meet
the Circle K Chargers in
what could be the biggest up-
set of the year tomorrow at
Trees Field. (I'm not going
to say who will do the upset-

ting. Like the weatherman,

"I prefer to keep a loophole
in my prediction.) In any

’ event, if the players are not -

blown off the ﬁeld by the 50
mile per hour
winds that
ravage t h e
hilltop, foot-
ball enthusi-
asts will see
a touch foot-
ball game be-
tween the so-
‘ rority women
nnssrucus (Owls) and
Junior Kiwanis Clubbers
(Circle K Chargers).

When the Owls were ﬁrst
challenged, there was great
speculation concerning the
size of the Chargers. “How
big are they?” was the ﬁrst
question posed. “What are
you worried about their size
for—it’s touch football, not
tackle,” one of her sisters
reminded. “Maybe so but

 

I some of those guys have a

pretty strong touch.” An-
other sister sounded the
warning: “Remember Mrs.
Kennedy.”

“BUT IT’S for charity,
girls,” someone chimed in.

“Do you mean people are
going to pay to watch us?"
The President's‘ gavel clear-
ed the air of dissension and
11 hardy Owls offered them-
selves for the “Cause” —
fully aware of the bruised
knees and battered ankles to
come. -

. Football was in the air the
last two weeks before the
game. To get in shape. some
girls did exercises late at
night in the hall of the Chi
Omega suite. Others took
three laps daily around the

"  , for exercise. or-..

   

ran up the hill to their Alum-
ni Hall chemistry classes. It
was considered “sissy” to

take the elevator. « After all, ‘

whatwere legs made for. So
they wore thin more shoe
leather climbing up to the
24th ﬂoor to pay their bills.

Football was a constant
topic of conversation. When
rushees came for rush par-
‘ties in the suite, the actives
looked them over carefully.
One of the sisters had warn-
ed the rest: “From the looks
of things, our ﬁrst string
isn't going to survive prac-
tice, much less the game, so
we’ll need a second string
team.” As the actives scru-
tinized the rushees, they
asked each other: “What
kind of football player do
you think she would make.”
“I hear she can throw a
30 - yard. pass. That's good
enough for us."

A TYPICAL dinner-table
conversation went like this:
“Are you really playing?”
“Oh, yes. I don't know a
thing -about the game but as
long as I -don’t lose a contact
or break a leg, I'll be all
right. Why aren’t you play-
ing? 4 -

“Well, my boyfriend is
coming 3000 miles to see me
in the next few weeks and
I'd like to be in one piece.”
Another chimed in: “I’m
saving myself for the ski
weekend.” -

I SOON became enthusi-

astic about the game, and‘

considered playing even
though I couldn’t tell a half-
back from a full-back. I ask-
ed the advice of a few guys

~ that I knew. “Oh, sure, why

not play. It would be good
for you,” they told me. I
soon learned that their ad-
vice to play was like sug-
gesting that I should jump

off Panther Hollow Bride.’

Marvin “Isiah” Zelkowitz
of Yogi fame told me that
he would be playing against
me. He was so overjoyed
that I knew he must be plan-
ning to pay me back for cri-
ticizing his‘ singing and. de-
manding that he put wom-
en's sports‘ on the sports
page.

When the day of the ﬁrst
practice finally arrived, the
coaches got to see what the
Owls could do or to be more
speciﬁc, what the Owls could
not do. Our captain, Bar-
bara Beam, having already
achieved fame for her pass-
ing ability, learned how to
kick. (Her bruised ankle still
reminds her. of that day).
The coaches announced,
“They’re going to win.”
They (the girls) staggered
backto their rooms (via the
elevators, after all, what are
elevators made for), and
hoped their wounds would
heal before the big game.

Students Take
Responsibility

Editor, The Pitt News:

In the Jan. 25 edition the fol-
lowing statement was attributed
to Leonard Schwartz, president
of Men’s Council: “The ﬁrst step
in solving the problem (lack of
academic integrity) must come‘
from the faculty."

We wish to make it known
that there are some on campus
who are willing to take respon-
sibility for their own actions. To
foist the responsibility for eradi-
cating student dishonesty onto
the - faculty is a rank injustice
and indicative of an appalling
lack of maturity and responsi-
bility. .

The‘ faculty's obligation to us,
though it is large, does not and)
should not, extend to giving us
something we should have
acquired long before we came
here: a sense of honor. Asking
the faculty to set up punitive
measures as a deterrent to cheat-
ing is a step, but it very neatly
skirts the fundamental problem:
a prevailing student belief -that
cheating is not morally wrong.

Assuming that a student is free
to choose whether he will cheat
or not, we submit that the re-
sponsibility for that choice lies
with the individual. In asking
the faculty to take the ﬁrst step
in solving what is undoubtedly
a question of individual consci-
ence, Mr. Schwartz is showing a
reprehensible la'ck,of willingness
to stand accountable for his con-
duct. The burden is our’s not
theirs! -

Reader Disputes.
‘News’ Stories

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Pitt News hit an all time
high for inept writing in the Jan. '
25 issue. ‘

On page two we ﬁnd an at-
tempt, if a feeble one, at re-
viewing Ideas and Figures. In-
stead of a compact precise re-
view, we get a personal insight
into the strife between Editor
Ron Caplan and his staff. This
appears to be just so much pad-
ding in a plain downright poor
piece of writing.

Martha Fry has used so many
cliches and inserted so many
useless statements that, although
I think I agree with her opinion
of the magazine, I will never
really be certain.

Really, Miss Fry, can we des-
cribe Ed Roberson’s book as “lov-
ing care?"

Turning to page four, we hap-
pen upon an editorial on the tri-
mester system by’ Joel Beeler."
Mr. Beeler feels that we stu-
dents not getting enough “in-
tellectual stirnulation" under
our present educational system.
Is it necessary for a student to fall
behind every time he has an
exam? I think not. Mr. Beeler
suggests a fantastic change in

- system whereby we would at-

tend classes for a few weeks, and
then spend several weeks “read-
ing, writing papers, and assirn- l
ilating material.”

Are we not to read during the
ﬁrst portion of our term? Per-
haps we are to attend class with
the hope of being injected by the
professor with some magical
term? Perhaps we are to attend

class with the hope of being in- --
iected I? the nraisssorswith some 

Letters to the Editor

magical serum called knowledge.
And during this period of “no
more classes” are we really go-
ing to do all this work, or would
the ﬁnal week become one big
cram session?

I wonder how many social
functions Mr. Beeler attends
which rob him of his valuable
time for “stimulation of intellec-
tual curiosity?”

On page six (you’ll notice the
bad news writing appears only
on even numbered pages) Mar-

 

vin Zelkowitz honors us with I“
one of his “With It” columns. If ~

this writing is with it, then we
prefer being without it.

It seems that Mr. Zelkowitz
only writes a column when Asso-
ciate Editor Bob Smizik writes
one on the same topic two issues
before. Must we be subjected to
this same gibberish twice over.

And perhaps Mr. Zelkowitz
would stop trying to imitate Jim
O’Brien with his analogies which
leave much to be desired. Is there
any chance that we'll see some-
thing original soon in Mr. Zelko-
witz’s column? It's certainly time
to get “with it.”

Randy Cohen
Liberal Arts ’67

(Editor: Mr. Cohen might be
interested to know that the syr
tem described by Joel Beeler is

--1

basically the same one used at p -

Oxford and we must say, with a
fair amount of success. In addi-

_dz'tion, Marvin Zelkowitz has

written 26 columns in thesports
pages since September, while Bob
Smizilc has written but five on

’-" the sports pages.)

 

I S: F .Mystifies
Reader

Editor, The Pitt News:

In the winter Ideas’ and Fig-
ures, item number four under
the heading: “A Sampler/for L,”
reads, in part, as follows:

“Eyes’, for a time/sky/a play-
er’s lip/plights trust/mind of
sky/hearcl ﬁrst world/offer
words’ . . .”

Wo_rds without context and ob-

:-

D

scure sense images come tumb- ” ‘

ling over one and other and seem
to fall on the page at random, to

be called poetry. Without ap- '

pearing facetious, I should like
to present some other lines:

“Gold sequins swing/back and‘
forth/pretty/I like gold ladies/
like stars. . ."

The subject here is a circus
aerial performer. The author is
not a professional poet but a dis-

turbed schizophrenic, .unfortun-
ately conﬁned in a state mental
hospital.

It seems unfortunate to me

5 '

P

that unrelated thoughts bobbled "

by a person out of touch with
reality should be so similar to
what we call our representative
poetry. I do not wish to call mod-
ern poets madmen. I am conﬁ-
dent that they are capable of
organization and rationality.

I do wonder if the public,
which supports this poetry, may
not be a victim of some mass de-
lusion. I think it is time for peo-
ple who ﬁnd such collections as
Ideas and Figures a strange mix-
ture of good and had work to
stand up and shout something
equivilent to “the emperor has
not clothes on.”

The one game home stand

as the hoopsters left yester-
day for the University of
Massachusetts for a game

’ tonight. Then they travel

for a game with Dartmouth
tomorrow night.

‘ Massachusetts wasn't on the
Panther’s schedule last year and
this year have a 7-4 record and

.7 are 4-1 in the Yankee Confer-

ence. They won their first ﬁve

, games and then dropped one to

Fordham and two in the Queens
City Tournament. Leading scorer
on the team is guard Clarence
Hill with center Tim Edwards
and forward Charley O’Rourke
as the other major scoring

‘ threats.

Dartmouth has a similar rec-
ord to Pitt having won three
games and lost nine. Two play-‘
ers who scored well against the

- _ Panthers last year, Davis Blaine

(26) and Victor Mair (20) will be
back for Dartmouth. The Pan-
thers won the game that was

Barr Shows Little Concern
Over Road Trip Competition

On the gymnastics _team’s road trip to Army and
Springﬁeld this‘ weekend, it will encounter some of the best
trampolinists in the country but this fact will have no effect -
on Panther specialist Gary Barr.

“Gymnastics isn’t a sport where you’re really concerned
about the other guys,” said Barr. “You work toward perfec--

tion for yourself and it doesn’t do any good to know about I

the other person.”
Trampolining as an event was
just added to the gymnastic rou-
tine this year. Since it is a new
event the judges are rating on

ity as in the other events.
Much criticism has been level-

on the trampoline. This has in-

“It’s a new sport and past ex-
perience is very important,” said
Barr. “I have to be realistic about

ter than me. It hurts my pride
but there's nothing I can do
about it except work harder." .

Ron Wedemeyer and Dave Jus-
tus in the breast while Tom

Frank Reed and Mike Olesak

Grady said all the boys, includ-
ing Reed, are in good physical

Maryland Opposes

Matmen Tomorrow

, By BILL CABINE
Captain Lee Hall leads the matmen against Maryland
tomorrow at 2 :00 p.m. at the Field House. The matmen are
winless this season, but have never lost a dual meet to Mary-

land in eight years.

‘Hall faces Mary1and’s promising sophomore Bob Karch
in the 177-pound match. Karch, a native of Mill Hall, Pa.,

had an undefeated freshman sea-
son, and coach Rex Peery des-
cribes him as “a good wrestler.”
Hall has a 2-0-1 record. .

The Terrapins also pose a
strong lineup in the other upper
weight divisions, Co-captain Bob
Kopnisky leads the heavier
weight wrestlers in the 157-pound
division. Kopnisky, a native of
Shaler Township, won the 157-
pound title in the Coast Guard
Academy Tournament the past
two years, and ﬁnished ﬁfth in
the 1964 NCCA Tournament.

Clair Riley makes his first ap-
pearance of the season in the
167-pound match against the Ter-
raDin’s Amando Soto. Soto won
the 167-pound championship in
the Atlantic Coast Conference
last year.

Bill Beck faces another tough
heavyweight match against Olaf

Track Coach Expects»
Easy Win Tomorrow

The Panther track team travels to Slippery Rock Col-

lege tomorrow afternoon for a meet beginning at 1 :30 
This will probably be the easiest meet all season for the
tracksters. “I don’t want to sound too conﬁdent,” stated
Coach Rees, “but We will probably hold Jim Flanigan, who
has a bad wrist, and Dave Sallach, with a bruised hip, out of

the meet. We do not expect too
much difficulty with Slippery
Rock.”

The Rockets have three key
men returning from last year’s
squad which lost to the Panthers,
53-38. Dave Puris runs the 50-
yard dash and is probably their
best runner. Chuck Robertson
competes in the 600-yard run,
but Bill DelVecchio ran this dis-
tance faster last Saturday by
three seconds than Robertson did
last year. The third letterman
back for the Rockets this year is
Fred Crissman, who won the
pole valult by clearing 13 feet.
Mort Stanﬁeld cleared this height
in winning the event against
Kent State last Saturday.

“Unless Slippery Rock comes
up with some outstanding fresh-
men, who they are allowed to
used in varsity competition, we
should have an easy time of it,”
said Rees. Luddy Hayden, who
was a bit disappointed with his
showing against Kent State when
he kept hitting hurdles, agreed.
“We have put in .. hard week
of practice, but it wasn’t for Slip-
pery Rock. We have two tough
meets after this one, with Army
and Navy, and we’re getting
ready for them.”

The freshmen will not be com-
peting in this meet, which will
make it harder for the fellows
who run more than one event.

F rosh Battle
Youngstown

A combination of continued
hustling and improved officiating
could enable the freshman bas-
ketball team to snap a ﬁve game
losing streak at Youngstown to-
morrow night.

The Cubs reached the high
point of their season Tuesday
night against West Virginia.

Drozdov. Drozdov ﬁnished second
in the 1964 ACC tournament, and
is the ﬁrst three-sport letterman
at Maryland since 1946. He has
lettered in football, track, and
wrestling.

“They have their best men in ‘

the 147-pound and up divisions,”
said Peery, contemplating an-
other rough week in the upper
weights. Frank O’Kom faces Nel-
son Aurand in the 147-pound

smatch. Aurand won the 157-

pound ACC title in 1964.

Dino Boni, however, returns to
the 137-pound division to bolster
the matmen’s hopes. Boni had
missed the Syracuse meet, and

had a draw with Michigan State’s 5

Dick Cook last week, in the 147-
pound -match.
