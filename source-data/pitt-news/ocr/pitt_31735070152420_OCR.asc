gram Council’s annual Battle of the Bands

‘competition, held on March 20, will open

Bigelow Bash. Bands MisterWives and
The Mowgli’s are scheduled to perform

2010, after surveying random students to
determine interest and consulting with
various parties within PPC. According

of stepping in and stopping aggressive
behavior when necessary,” she said.

According to Pitt’s 2012 Jeanne Clery
Act statistics report, sexual assault is
deﬁned as-nonconsensual, but nonforc-
ible sexual intercourse. Forcible sexual
offenses includesforcible rape, sodomy,
sexual assault with an object, forcible
fondling and sexual assault.

Pitt’s campus crime report stated that
there were six reports of forcible sexual
offenses that occurred on campus, one
on noncampus property and three on
public property in 2012.

Ruiz explained that the Office of
Sexual Assault Services, which is part
of the Counseling Center, develops and
disseminates educational information

throughout campus about sexual assault
and how to prevent it. 

In addition, Ruiz said "that peer edu-
cators are trained to present _programs
on sexual assault, dating violence and
stalking. _ .

“Speciﬁc programming is provided
for all first-year and transfer students.
The programs involve the use of skits,‘

role plays, videos and interactive discus-'1

sions,” she said. “Bystander prevention

approaches are included in .the.preven-.

tion curriculum.” >
According to‘Ruiz, peer educators
work to “make themselves available to
students in residence halls, to sorority
and fraternity chapters and as requested
by other campus groups. _ ”

Assault Awareness Week,” Ruiz said.

At Carnegie Mellon University, faculty‘
members have taken a similar approach
to combating sexual assault.

Jessica Klein, coordinator of Gender
Programs and Sexual Violence Preven-
tion at Carnegie Mellon University, be-
lieves that bystander intervention is one
of thebest tactics.

“We do not have a separate ‘bystander
intervention program at CMU, but there

’ is a bystander component in training

[our students]. Our training is centered
around individuals being an ‘active
change,” Klein said. V R

Klein said she believes that to make
an “active change” in their community,
studentshave to step in and help when
theynotice a situation that doesn’t seem
right, rather than just stand by.

Klein has only been a part of the Sex-

 

ual.Assault Services at CMU for seven
months, but she has already brought
forth important changes. ’

“We strive for a healthy balance in_
students when it comes to sexuality,”

‘ she said. “For me, I think that teaching

students critically about how to prevent
sexual assault in the first place, both for
themselves and others, should be the_
main focus [of preventing sexual abuse] .”

According to CMU’s annual Security .
and Fire Safety Report, there were five re-

corded forcible sexual offenses in 2008,

but in 2012 there were 17. ’
Klein said that there has been a sig-

nificant increase in sexual abuse report-

ings over the past six months at CMU not ‘ R

because there have been more cases,but
because the University has become a saf-

Reviewing Pitt’s decision: Gallagher“ mysterious choice until

Yusuf Dorner
For The Pitt News

Not long ago, a secretive chan-

cellor selection committee an-.
nounced Patrick D. Gallagher
as its choice to succeedthe cur-
rent University of Pittsburgh,
chancellor, Mark A. Norden—
berg. On Aug. 1, Gallagher will

down from his current post at

merce and as director" of the
National Institute of Science

and Technology, which he

was appointed to by President
Barack Obama himself.

While‘ the assembly mind-
lessly follows and greets any
new leader who is graciously
and unanimously bestowed.
upon it, my natural reaction.
is skepticism. It would be rude
to throw about inquiries based
on gutfeeling, so instead, let

us resort toyreason.

In lieu of specialized dean
hours, speeches of things yet

to pass, petty meet and greets,

dry jokes and void appeals to
youth, it is important that

lwetconsider the rhetoric and
‘previous experiences of the

chancellor-electand compare
it to the academic, social and
economic ci_rcumstances in
which our University currently

 

stands.

. The secrecy of the afore-
mentioned appointment pan-
el is actually quite ‘admirable.
This allowed it to conduct an
important decision.free from
unnecessary public interfer-
ence. But now that the process
is over, I believe the public, stu-
dents and faculty should have
full access to the minutes of
every session the committee
held and a list of names of the

-top choices of successors‘ for
our University.
The availability of this in-
formation will allow us, the
public, to follow the method

and thought stream that led to °

the placement of the chancel-

OPINIONS s

lor-elect. It will act as a proof
of why the Board of Trustees
felt Gallagher was more ca-
pable than what, according
to Bill Schackner of the Pitts-
burgh P0st—Gazette, University
officials say were “hundreds”.
of candidates. ' _ A -
Gallagher, through his re-
cent appearances at Pitt gath-
erings, including aimeet and
greet in the William Pitt Union
and a pregame introduction at

‘a basketball game, has prom-

ised many things to students.
In terms of tuition, Galla-
gher noted, “What you really
need to ensure is the afford-
ability of the college doesn’t
affect access and education.”

. ' V v 0 '
further notice
This statement is almost
hard to digest in light of his

set salary of more than half a
million dollars a year with “re—

° tention incentive payments of

$100,000.” ,
Moreover, Pitt ranked first
in anunfortunate category in
2013, the-Department of Edu-
cation Data listed Pitt as the
most expensive public uni-
versity in the country. The
University Times reports that
this year students were slapped
with a whopping 3.25—percent
increase in tuition, bringing
the annual in-state total for
full-time students to more than

$16,000 and the out-of-state total to a
whopping $26,000. .
Gallagher, in seemingly genuine
good-heartedness, vowed to strengthen
ties with various local Pittsburgh insti-
tutions, including our medical system.
The University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, one of those entities, has long

since been marred by controversy. It‘

has been accused of a wide variety of
misdeeds ranging from poor worker
treatment to poverty wages and was_
criticized for its recent decision to

close down one of its branches in an’

impoverished neighborhood only to
open another in a wealthier area by
groups representing UPMC employees..

1 In his acceptance speech, Gallagher
said that he wanted to prioritize stu-
dents. Conversely, through my eyes as
a student who’s -both employed by and
attends Pitt, I see nothing but empty

grandiloquence from a man who was

elected CEO by a collection of individu-
als who, in and of- themselves, donot
fully represent the actual modern ra-
cial and socioeconomic diversity of our

‘great school. Namely, these individu-

als, though some have direct academic
experiences at Pitt, donot adequately
represent the current student body
and local community.‘ Although their
achievements have proved them worthy

V of their positions, there is no adequate

representation of the student body and

5

community, which is necessary to make

a more cohesive decision.

So, until Gallagher proves otherwise,
he does not have my full support. I sup-
port him inasmuch as his office holds
due respect from students, but I refuse
to give my full personal support to any

man “just because.” This is especially ‘

true of someone of his positionbecause
his choices will affect our lives not only
here at University of Pittsburgh, but
after. I

Former Steelers” sta encourages studenlisto rise above challenges

Andrew Fishman
Staff Writer

Aside from the multiple Super Bowl champi-

M onships, a Super Bowl MVP award, winning

“Dancing with the Stars” and other feats,

. most people recognize Steelers great Hines

Ward for his unique ﬁrst name. -
But on Wednesday night at the Pitt Pro-
gram Council—sponsored lecture he gave
in front of 375 students, Ward said his last
name is where, he gets his motto.
“Will Always Rise above Difﬁculty,” said
Ward “I was never raised to be a quitter.”

Ward preached this mantra to the stu— '

dents in attendance and discussed his strug-
gles with growing up biracial — his father
is black and his mother is Korean —- and
ﬁghting through other adversities, all while
staying positive. _
“At some point, I think everyone faces‘

. some adversities,’-’ said Ward in an inter-

view he gave before the lecture. “It’s how

_you handle it. That’s what builds character.”

Jon Lehan, the executive board director
of PPC, said that Ward‘ was chosen for the
lecture on the basis of his legacy in Pitts-
burgh as well as the important issues he was

planning on discussing.
‘‘Hines_ Ward, being an almost legendary

 B  community and city itself,” Lehan said.

Ward spoke about his childhood ‘grow-»
ing up in a single-parent household and the

if T . teasing he faced because he was biracial. .

“Everyone knows me for my smile, but
to get to know the guy behind the smile,
you have fo_ know a little bit about my life,”
said Ward. W l . '

After the Disco
Broken Bells
-Grade» B-

Sounds like: the last track

at ‘an ‘-803 dance party,- '
soothingly playing while a sad
man in a crumpled tuxedo

stumbles out and the janitor

begins sweeping up confetti.

Broken Bells’ second LP has all the ele-
ments of grooving dance music, but the

. album plays out like a soothing, almost

wearying comedown — this is a true

post-party album, literally what'you_
‘ listen to after the disco.

Four years after the band’s playful
self-titled debut, the collaboration be-
tween producer Brian Burton (Danger
Mouse), who has‘ worked with artists
such as Beck and The Black Keys, and
James Mercer, frontman of the popular

' indie band The Shins, continues with

After the Disco. The new album is less
like the mellow electronics-infused
hipster alt-rock of its predecessor and
more of an ‘80s homage, though the

_ stylistic differences between the two

records is, unfortunately, minimal.

_ Every song on this album has the‘
potential to be a single, and.-while points
will always be awarded for consistency,

- this project is just a bit too clean, calcu-

lated and safe for its own good. As the
sound reaches back to the ‘80s,‘ there’s
just not enough soul to ‘pay respect to
the style it imitates. . e

That being said, After the Disco is ’

effortlessly listenable,‘and, because it

- doesn’t quite warrant unbroken atten-
tion, it makes for the ‘best background

music around. What worked on the
duo’s debut album — the_ shimmer-
ing synths, Danger Mouse’s insistent

Broken Bells goes for  post—party feel on Afterthe Disco

beats and Mercer’s pleasantly simple
vocal melodies — is still present here,
particularly on the album’s indulgently
long opening track “Perfect World,” but
sadly there are no sureﬁre highlights
like “The Ghost Inside” or “October.”
Many other tracks harken back to

the amusing pomp of mu_sic as it ex- A'

isted three decades ago, successfully
and sometimes less so —_ the choir-
heavy choruses of “Leave It Alone” and
“The Changing Lights” are afcharming
trick, but while the former scores with
church—gospel sensibilities and dra-
matic strings, the latter is repetitive

Recently, solo artist Mike Doughty re-
leased some of his old demos from an
apparent late-1990s foray into electronic
dance music, or EDM, featuring a cap-
pella vocals by none other than the late
Elliott Smith. ‘

That’s right, Elliott Smith: the master
of sweet, sad acoustic tracks that make

miser'y.sound appealing. Um, what?
A‘ ’ Unfortunately, this is not ‘a.joke..

Doughty has put three awful songs on
his Bandcamp account with the equally

: repellent titles f‘The Record,” “Dogs”

and “Burn (Aah.F*ck).”

Apart -from ‘reeking of amateurish
underproduction, Doughty’s songs —
and EDM in general —— are stylistically
opposite of the work of the perpetually
melancholy Smith and clash horribly
with his soft—spoken approach to singing.

$This'doesn’t mean that two opposite-
sounding artists can’t collaborate to

'make somethinglbeautiful, which has

been proven with the rise of sampling
in music, but Smith had a reputation

It’s hard to distinguish one songfrom
the other two, since all three are made up
of the same hazy formula. In “Burn (Aa_h
F*ck),’? we hear a disorienting drum-
beat synthesizer backing annoyingly

redundant Smith vocals, which sound

more like a whiny, skipping record than
anything else. What’s more frustrating,
however, is that the lyrics aren’t even

' comprehendible. We get the impression
* that Smith was used just for the appeal

of his name. ,

There’s only two things worth_ not-
ing about these bizarre hybrid anach-
ronisms: the ﬁrst being Smith singing
an early version of his song “BottleUp
and_Explode!” before it had been ofﬁ—
cially released in “The Record” and the

,, second, hearing some in—studio banter

from him on “Dogs.” As a fan of Smith,
I always ﬁnd it to be a rare treat to hear
him speak conversationally and to re-
member him as the human being who
lived apart from his music. '

. As is the casefor each of these songs,
“The Record” would sound a whole lot

better if there were fewer gimmicks in- ~

and easily the most disposable-track
ofthe 11. However, on.“Ho1ding on for

Life,” arguably the standout track, these ’

styles are utilized to their full, corny
potential. .
M,ercer, despite delivering sweet
vocals, is rather inconsistent in terms
of the quality of his lyrics. Many are
forgettable —— just thechorus of the
very first song features the less—than—
inspired line, “I thought love would al-
ways find a way, but I know better now”
— though on several tracks he proves

' his capability to be clever without being ‘

cutesy or trying too hard.

Thé closing song, “The Remains of
Rock and Roll,”-features hisbest lyrics
on the album, eloquently describing

the path to paradise where “suddenly.
earth is far below,” as Mercer declares,
“I’m off to the promised land if anyone

p needs a ride, it’s a small car but we’ll
l ﬁt inside if weleave our bags behind.”

Sure, if it isn’t broken why bother

ﬁxing it, but despite the success Mer— '

Mercer and Burtonyhave enormous '

talent, and it shows, but their limits

 the infectious title track, _as Mercer in

pleading falsetto wonders, “How did I

sounds might be familiar, but we will

songs is their simplicity — a man and
his acoustic guitar. But as Smith sings
on this track, his precious words and
signature shaky voice are soiled by Auto-
Tune, chopped up into tiny pieces and
mercilessly repeated, resulting in an
electronic stew of noise.

irritations, just Smith offering sugges-
tions for the song. This lasts 20 sec—
onds or so before defaulting back to the
same formula as the other two songs and
quickly becomes too irritating to ﬁnish.
Not long after Smith ceases speaking, his
words are contorted, echoing, ‘fDogs,

dogs, dogs,” to a few spastic keyboard»

notes, like an animated YouTube video
with dancing animals.

In between listens to “Dogs,” “The '

Record” and “Burn (Aah F*ck),” I actually
had to pause and put on some of Smith’s
own music in an attempt to persuade
myself that this had all just been some
bad dream. - ~

But of course it wasn’t. These songs
are anabomination to Smith’s name. If
Doughty wanted to release these songs to
Smith’s fans, he should have respectfully

Ward’s talk was not entirely advice-based.
He kept the audience laughing by joking

_ about his lack of hair, his work with Bob Cos-

tas and the questionable choices he made
along the way, such as blowing money on a
convertible while living in chilly Pittsburgh.

In addition, Ward talked about his other
adventures since retiring from the NFL,
such as performing on —— and winning —
“Dancing with the Stars,” acting in “The
W_alkingDea ” and “The Dark Knight Rises”
as well as competing in an Iron Man com-
petition. '

“I wanted to always beknown-as more
than just a footballplayer, but really an all-
around guy,” Ward said.

Ward compared himself to Forrest Gump
in that he can’t really explain all the success
he has had in his life, but he took what was
given to him and made the most out of it.

“He’s got a shrimping boat company, I
don’t have that,” Ward joked with the crowd.
“But I’ve had success.”

Ward’s many fans in the audience were
buzzing before he came out to speak, don-
ning “86” jerseys and cheering as he walked
on stage. Steelers fan Lisle Weaver, a junior

’ A English writing major at Pitt, enjoyed seeing

one of his childhood idols in person.

“I think for a popular athlete to come
back to Pittsburgh and give advice to stu-
dents, I think that’s someone they will listen
to,” Weaver said.

Ward’s ﬁnal message stressed the im-
portance social media plays in our society.

“I really just want to challenge you guys
to be careﬁil how you brand yourself,” said.
Ward. “Let your brand stand for something.”

FOOTBALL _

C Pitt  former-NFL

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football head coachlPaul Chryst ﬁlled

his coaching staff ’s vacancy at the wide '

receiver coaching position with former
National Football League wideout Greg

' Lewis. Lewis replaces Bobby Engram,

also a former NFL wide receiver, who
departed earlier this month to work as

' a wide receivers coach for the Baltimore -

Ravens. , .
Lewis spent eight seasons in the NFL,
playing six for the Philadelphia Eagles

. and two with the Minnesota Vikings. In

his career, Lewis caught 152 passes for
1,992 yards and eight touchdowns.
“Greg really impressed us with his

, knowledge, energy and desire to teach

the game,” Chryst said. “Hisbackground

as a college and NFL receiver willserve

our players‘ and staff well.” '

F - Lewis, who is originally from Chicago,
played his collegiate football at the Uni-
versity of illinois, where he caught 103
passes for 1,456 yards and 12 touchdowns
from 1999 to 2002. In his junior season,

  — SPORTS  

the Illini went 12-2 to win the Big Ten
Championship and reach the Sugar Bowl.
After retiring from the NFL, Lewis

spent a year at the University ‘of San Di- g

ego in 2012 and coached Sanjose State’s

receiving corps in 2013. Under Lewis,.

receiver Chandlerjones was named to the
first-team All-Mountain West Conference

team, and Tyler Winston was named the P

MWC Freshman of the Year.

Jones set a school record with 15
receiving touchdowns —. a total that
tied for third-best in the nation’ — and
caught 79 passes for 1,356 yards. Win-
ston amassed four 100—yard receiving

games and recorded 58 receptions for -

858 total yards.

Lewis -is the fourth new coach to join
Chryst’s staff this offseason, joining
strength and conditioning coach Ross

. ‘Kolodziej, secondary coach Troy Douglas
. and running backs coach Johnisettle.

“It is a tremendous opportunity to
work with agreat coach in Paul Chryst at
a storiedprogramlike Pitt,” Lewis said.
“We are going to work very hard to build
on the great" history that Pitt has.” I

Coming offa Senior Daywinover Clemson on
Sunday, Pitt women’s basketball has a chance
to do something it has not accomplished since
February 2011 —— win two conference games

.inarow. « -

Following the Sunday victory,’ Pitt (11-15,
3-9 ACC) travels to Blacksburg, Va., Thursday
night to take on the ACC’s worst team, the
Virginia Tech Hokies. '

Virginia Tech (11-14, 1-11 ACC), picked to

- 1 ﬁnish13th——-two spotsaheadofthePanthers

— in the ACC preseason media and coaches
poll, lost its ﬁrst seven conference games this
season and enters Thursday night’s contest
looking to snap a four-game losing streak.
“This game is pivotal for us because we

' \

are looking at Virginia Tech, ranked lowest
in the standings. We have three wins — they
have one,” head coach Suzie McConnell-Serio
said. “We talked about not ﬁnishing last in

the conference where we have been picked. .
We put a big emphasis on both the Clemson’ _
. game and this Virginia Tech game'in that we

are able to win one at home and another big
one on the road.” ' ‘ '
The game has seeding implications for the
Panthers, who currently sitin 12th place out of
15 ACC teams. Pitt is currently matched up to

playthe 13th—seeded Boston College Eaglesin -

the ﬁrst round of the ACC Tournament, which
begins March 5 in Greensboro, N.C.

Coming off a 16-point loss Sunday at Vir-
ginia Tech, the Hokies need to beat Pitt and
receive help to avoid being seeded the last of

15 teams in the ACC Tournament. —

Virginia Tech is led by senior forwardUju
Ugoka, who averages 19.4 points per game.
Ugoka, a native ofLagos, Nigeria, ranks third
in the ACC in scoring behind Wake Forest’s
Dearica Hamby (21.4 ppg) and Georgia Tech’s
Tyaunna Marshall (20.0 ppg).

Ugoka also ranks third in the conference

' in rebounding, pulling down 9.8 boards per

game- ‘ .

Slowing down Ugoka will be a point of
emphasis for McConnell-Serio’s Panthers.The

6-foot—1 forward presents a matchup problem

similar to the one Hamby did less than two

‘weeks ago.

After picking up three fouls in-the ﬁrst

’ half, Hamby came out in the second half and

dominated Pitt, posting 23 points and nine

ch for niatchup with last-place Hokies

rebounds in erasing a 17-point lead and ex-
ploiting the Panthers’ biggest weakness ——
post defense.

“We are going to mix up our defenses -
some zone and some manwith a key on her,f’
McConnell-Serio said. “We are going to have
to choose our spots to double-team her inman
and in zone, just making sure we know where
she is because she loves the short comer and
the high post.”

Hamby shot 9-of-12 from the ﬁeld in that
second-half comeback. On that night, she ex-
ploited undersized senior forward Asia Logan
and the other Pitt bigs in the middle of the 2-3
zone and fought through a defense that was
slow to double-team the talented forward.

Panthers into grueling ACC  

John DeMarco
For The Pitt News

With the Pitt baseball team coming off its
winningest season in program history,
duplicating similar results might prove
difficult. On top of that, the Panthers will
begin play in the ACC in the 2014 season,
facing entirely new competition.

But Pitt’s coaching staff thinks its
pitching rotation can ease the transi-
tion into one of the country’s toughest
conferences for baseball. .

Last year, the ACC sept eight teams to
the NCAA Tournament, and it seems this
season will be no different. According to

_ preseason polls, six conference foes will
* begin the year in the Top 25.

In their new conference, though, the
Panthers were picked to ﬁnish last in their
division by the ACC’s preseason coaches’
poll. 1 V '

‘~‘It is a completely different level of A
baseball,” head coach Joe Jordano said‘. .

“I say that with complete respect to my
friends and colleagues in the Big East

_ last season and to both the new Big East —

and the American Athletic Conference.”

Pitt’s baseball team won a program-
record 42 games in 2013 because of a
variety of factors. Seven hitters ﬁnished

A the year with a batting average above

.300. The pitching staif had three starters

. with eight wins or more. . _

But in baseball, good pitching alway
beats good hitting.
The steps the Pitt coaching staff takes

to ensure pitcher development, not only

this year, but for years to come, will be

,_ crucial in sustaining the success of the

prograni. Moreover, the exceptional
growth of Pi-tt’s pitching staff over the

’ past three years must remain consistent

for the program to ﬂourish in the ACC.
Dating back to the 2010 season, the
Panthers’ pitching staff has lowered its

' tea_m earned run average each season

under Jordano’s direction, from 5.95 in
2010 to 3.59 in 2013.

‘ Without a doubt, baseball’s distinct di-
vision of offense and defense gives pitch-
ers complete control of the game. It’s the

only major sport where the defense (the
pitcher) begins play with possession of
the ball. This alone makes the pitcher the
most powerful player on the diamond.
Just as development has proved vital
to the Pitt baseball program over.the past

.16 seasons, it functions similarly when

assessinglthe value of a pitcher.

College baseball, for a greater part
of the last decade, has fostered growth
for young, talented arms. The athletes
who decide to remain in college for all
four years become mpre in-tune with the
game before advancing to the profes-
sional level.

, Becoming a successful starting pitcher
is a process that does not exclude the
need for direction. For the Pitt coaching
unit, developing a well—rounded pitching
staff falls primarily on the shoulders of
pitching coach Jerry Oakes.’

While that process might take multiple
seasons — see recent MLB draftee Ethan
Mildren —- Oakes’ primary focus is on
putting his pitchers in the best possible
position to succeed.’ ‘

“I will always put our guys in the best
situation for them to have success,’5 Oakes
said. “I’ll never put a guy out there in a
role where he doesn’t feel comfortable.”

The most glaring obstacle the Panthers
face in the 2014 season is how Oakes and
the team will ﬁnd a way to compensate
forthe loss of Mildren to t°he'Minnesota
Twins. Without Mildren, there is a huge
gap to ﬁll in the third spot of the rotation.

Last year, Mildren combined with Matt
Wotherspoon and Rhys Aldenhoven for 27
wins on the mound. The synergy the start-
ing rotation developed in the course of
the season allowed the Panthers to thump
many opponents, and Wotherspoon and
Aldenhoven each recorded eight—game
winning streaks on the mound.

Finding the right replacement to keep
the rotation strong will be key this season.

Last season, the Panthers‘ went 35-7 when ,

the starting pitcher went ﬁve or more in-
nings. Similarly, the team ﬁnished with
an astounding 35-1 record when leading

after six innings. With that said, the im-
portance of the starting staff’s ability to
last deep into games can’t be overstated.

Considering the large amount of pitch-
ers on the roster entering the season,
who will ﬁll this openvoid is a mystery

   

at the moment.
i “It may very well be a freshman,”Jor- *

dano said. “We have some solid arms that
will be ready, but a few that lack any col-
lege experience.” i -

Sunday in Myrtle Beach, S.C., fresh-
man T._]. Zeuch started the ﬁnal game
of Pitt’s three-game set against Coastal
Carolina. Zeuch allowed four unearned
runsand lasted only two and two—thirds
innings in his collegiate debut.

A lack of familiarity with the college
game could be a big hurdle for an inex-
perienced arm to overcome, especially
when Pitt begins facing ACC opponents.
Dependable arms and longevitywill b_e
crucialfor Pitt this season.

Because of this, a change in philosophy

might be necessary to sustain Pitt’s suc-
cess on the mound.

“Each year I go off what I have, so if
it’s a year like last year, I will go off the
starters,” Oakes said. “But a year like this
where we have a little more options, I will
probably use the bullpen more. Either

. way, each game Iwill go inning by inning

to give our team the best situation towin.”
. In Wotherspoon’s case, steady devel-
opment was key to his_ascent in his ﬁrst

‘three years as a Panther and will continue

to be important as he enters his senior

season. In 2013, he matched his win total

from the previous two seasons.
This type of achievement explains why
he was selected in the MLB draft a year

‘ago, though he opted to return to Pitt

for his senior season rather than signing
with the Detroit Tigers. Wotherspoon
will anchor Pitt’s weekend rotation as
the Friday starter and lead the team as it
faces new challenges in the ACC.‘
“Everyone has their expectations pret-
ty high for this season,” he said. “We are
looking forward to going out and playing
hard, clean, fundamental baseball.” i

Ugoka will present a very similar matchup
problem for the Pitt forwards. Injanuary, she
posted 29 points against No. 3 Duke and is
similar to Hamby in that she can completely
take over a game.

“We just have to recognize where the help
defense is coming from and prevent her from

catchingthe ball down the block,” McConnell- '

Serio said. “Putting pressure on the passer

. will help. Wehave to be active when we do go
. to the zone.” P

Ugoka teams with freshman guard Vanessa
Panousis, who averages 12.1 points per game.

_The Sydney, Australia, product is ﬁfth in the

ACC in assists, with 4.1 per game.

McConnell-Serio said this might be the
most important game to date in Pitt’s inaugural
ACC season.

“'I‘l1is would be a huge win for us,” McCo— I h

nnell-Serio said. “To be able to get four con-
ference wins and gain some separationfrom
VirginiaTéch and having only three conference
games left after this, it would really solidily us
in the standings.” 3
