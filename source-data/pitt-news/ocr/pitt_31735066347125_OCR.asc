The controversial new plan for
the academic governance of Pitt’s
School of Medicine failed to achieve
enough support at a recent meeting
of the medical school ‘faculty,
causing a delay in the ﬁnal vote on
the plan.

The new governance ~ plan, if
approved, will replace the present
plan of governance which has been
in effect since 1964, and it would
provide for closer intergration of the
intern and resident programs at the
hospitals associated with the
University Health Center of Pitts-
burgh, Inc. (UHCP),

The five member hospitals
afﬁliated with UHCP are ‘Monte-

Assistant sociology professor
Paul Nyden presented a letter
written by two Soviet educators in
support of the Marxist professor’s
battle to remain at Pitt during a
second -hearing before the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Tenure
and Promotion Review Board
Monday.

Q The‘Soviets referred to.Nyden as
“an active champion of the vital
interests of American miners, a true
democrat and opponent of any
discrimination. ’ ’

They said they believed his

political reasons and said such .

action “contradicts the letter and
spirit of the Final Act of the Helsinki
Summit Conference.” I
The Helsinki Act referredto is
concerned with freedom of thought
‘and belief.
Nyden also said articles concern-

ing his contract battle are appearing ‘
in various ‘Soviet publications and

that the publicity is causing concern

0. among some Pitt ofﬁcials that the

proposed exchange program be-
tween Pitt .and Moscow and
Leningrad state universities will be
jeopardized.

Assistant history professor Eu-
gene Vinogradoff, coordinator of
.the exchange program, has said,
however, that the Soviet press

converage of the N yden case will not

hurt negotiations.‘ — _

Pitt and the State University of
New York are both seen as likely
choices for the exchange program,
which was suggested by the U.S.
State Department. _

The Soviet’s letter, adressed to
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, was
signed by G.V. Sharapov, corres-
ponding member of the U.S.S.R.

Part of the controversy centers

- around a provision that would give

each med school department
chairman the responsibility of
designing a uniform program for
intern and resident training at all
hospitals rather than each staff
designing its own program.

The new plan also would set up
guidelines for the Executive
Committee of Faculty in the School
of Medicine, as well as guidelines
for conferring tenure on full-time
faculty. ,

After -the new plan was reviewed
at the meeting, a motion to vote on
the document failed to receive the
necessary two-thirds majority" thus

making a vote on the plan itself 

impossible. Later in the meeting, a
vote to approve a watered-down
version failed by a small margin.

Peter Camejo, the Socialist
Workers Party presidential candi-

date, in a campaign speech last 0‘
~night at Squirrel Hill's Linden

School, said this nation’s‘policy puts
proﬁtsbefore human needs. _

‘ ‘Corporation proﬁts this year are
the highest we’ve ever seen, and
the Gross National Product output
will probably be, too. Yet American
workers are making six per cent less
this year,” Camejo said.

The 36-year-old Socialist candi-

date criticized the projected cut-
-backs in social programs to‘ keep
inﬂation in line. “We are the
richest country in the world but
eight million people are out of work
and 26 million live below the
poverty line. And still they are
announcing cutbacks.”

Camejo said that six years ago,
blacks and women were ﬁnancially

discriminated against, but that now»

this wage differential has deteriora-
ted even_more. '
“Six years -- ago blacks were

“ . .Camejo panned the Ford/“Cart

percentage has droppedto 56%.

' Women, too, have dropped ﬁve per

cent against their 54% in 1970.”.
The existing power structure

‘diverts blame from the true

economic reasons for America’s
plight, Camejo said, by dividing the
peoplelagainst one another. “They
say they have to increase taxes
because of swelled welfare rolls, but
the truth is the average worker pays
four dollars in ‘taxes each day“fo’r the
-war fund, two dollars for interest

_ payments for the rich with only 40

cents for welfare subsity.”
Camejo said the most important
election this year for the workers is
not the -presidential race but the
United Steelworkers (USW) union
presidential election. “Those
elections will have a lot of bearing

on the future of the American »

worker.”
_ Camejo called for the democrati-
zation of unions .and said Ed

Sadlowski, a rebel steelworker who“

heads the USW local’ in Chicago, is
the -best of the two candidates.

the hearing to obtain student input

into the remunerations procedure _

by which some student leaders are

immediately as a result of last .~

$15,000 of student activity fee to 25

student leaders, including student’

Nyden Review Hearing Held

(Continued from _Paoe 1)
Trade Union Movement; and V. A.
Korolkov, professor at the High
School of Trade Union Movement.

During questioning by the FAS
Review Board Monday afternoon,
Nyden claimed he could produce
evidence that Posvar intervened in
the decision to renew his contract,
citing two meetings between
Posvar, FAS Dean Jerome Rosen-
gerg and members of the sociology
faculty.

Speech professor Trevor Melia, a
member of the ﬁve-man Review
Board, asked Nyden why the
department had hired him (in
January, 1973) if they were as
anti-Marxist as some have claimed.

“I think their concept of what a
Marxist is was flawed,” Nyden
responded. “I was shocked, for
example, when they asked me to
attend a conference sponsored by
the Office of Naval Research.

_ Perhaps‘ they knew I was a Marxist

when they hierd me, but when they

got to know me, they found I was
also an activist.”

The Naval Research conference
Nyden referred to has been cited by
sociology department chairman
Burkart Holzner as an example of
“unprofessional conduct” on the
part of Nyden. Nyden admits to
missing a morning session of the
conference and dozing in his chair
during another session, but he said

- it was his way of protesting the

military atmosphere “without
creating a distairbance.”

At the close of the hearing, James
Logan, an attorney representing
Nyden, asked that he and Nyden be
present when witnesses appear to
give testimony against Nyden and
pointed out that a member of the
University’s legal staff had been
present at Monday's hearing.

Review Board chairman Michael
Margolis, as associate science
professor, said the request would be
taken into consideration.

Governance Vote Delayed .7

(Continued from Page 1)

According to Nathan Stark, vice
chancellor of the Health Profes-
sions, who supports the new plan,
the>_University must better. inte-
grate its graduate programs in
medicine or face a possible decline
in teaching standards at the medical
school.

Strong opposition to the new
governance plan was voiced by Dr.
Richard Kalla, president of the staff
at Monteﬁore Hospital and a faculty
member in the School of Medicine.

“While I don't see anything at all
wrong with the Medical School
controlling the undergraduate med-
ical program in. the UHCP training
_iospita1s,’I’m against anything that
interferes with the internal affairs of
each hospital, and I consider the
post graduate training of interns
and residents an internal affair.

“The University is trying to
control the post-graduate training
in each hospital even ‘though that
training is funded by the hospital
itself and not the University. As a

A Pat Gleason In Race

For Auditor General ,

BY MAGGIE MCKAY . .
The outcome of this year's

presidential race will determine the
election of Pennsylvania's next
auditor general, Pat Gleason,
Republican candidate for auditor
general said in .a speech at Pitt
yesterday.

“My own chances for auditor
general depend in a large part on
the presidential race. If the gap
between Ford and Carter is not
great,‘ then I'm going to win,"
Gleason said.

The auditor general is up for
election every four years and,
according to Gleason, with the
exception of Pennsylvania's current
Democratic auditor general Bob
‘Casey elected in 1972, it has been a
trend that the auditor general's race
has gone the way of the presidency.

The auditor general's office is one
of the most important in the state,
according to Gleason. “It is
charged under law to see that tax’
money is spent appropriately and
can audit any group receiving state
money. _The audit is a powerful tool
which can uncover fraud and
criminality," Gleason said.

The auditor general's position is
to not only concern himself with the
legality of the means in which tax
money is spent, Gleason said, but

also to determine effective use of
,the money. _

“He should be concerned with
such things as how state tax dollars
are used on education. We are
spending two to three times as
much money on children's educa-
tion, but their attainment level is
going ddwn,"‘ Gleason, said.

Gleason charged that the Shapp

, administration created a corrupt

power monopoly in Harrisburg and

the only office it doesn't control is:

the auditor general’s office.
"One of the worst things is
corruption in government whether
with Nixon, in D.C., or in
Harrisb_urg. Nobody can accuse me
of being an ally ofShapp. Shapp has
control of the Pennsylvania House,
the ; Senate, the Public Utility
Commission, 26 state agencies, the
state Treasurer's Office, and now
he wants the Auditor General’s
office as well," Gleason, a state
representativr from Cambria Coun-
ty, said. I
Gelason called Casey a “happy
accident” who runs“ the offic
independently of Shapp. «“The-
changes I would make in the office
are evoluationary, rather than
revolutionary. I want to build on
what Casey's done," he said.
Gleason also charged_ his Demo-
cratic opponent, Al Benedict, ‘ a
former television news anchorman
in Erie, had promised to work “in
close cooperation with the gover-
nor,“ if elected auditor general.
“If Benedict is successful, we will
have a deadening, glorified book-
keeper in Harrisburg," he said.
The Republican Party, according
to Gleason, is,‘ behind in voter
registration and so he plans to

spend most of his time campaigning _

in the following areas: Erie County,
Allegheny County, Johnstown-Al-
toona area, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre
area and the Greater Harrisburg
area. ,

matter of fact, we’re getting less

. support from the_University each

year,” Kalla said.

Stark also said-that a surveyteam
from the ‘American Medical Assoc-
iation and the -American Association

[I

of Medical Colleges recommended K

closer organizational ties between
the Medical School and the
hospitals of the University Health
Center.

“We, were told that we’d have to

get our house in order or face a ,

harder test for accreditation in the
future,” Stark said.

The findings of the accreditation
team did not reveal anything to the
School of Medicine that it didn’t
already know, said Gerhard Wer-
ner, dean of the School of Medicine.

“The findings of the accredita-
tion team just support the ﬁndings
of the committee that has been
working on the new governance
plan for the past year and a half,”
Werner said. . h .

According to Kaila, however, the °

accreditation team never officially
said that the University had to
integrate its postgraduate training
program. ' .
y “We never actually received an
official written report of the survey
team’s ﬁndings, but I understand
we were rated very favorably.
Someone did make an offhand
remark that integrating the post-
graduate program would ‘be some-
thing nice to work for, but certainly,
it wasn't a threat to deny us
accreditation in the future,” Kalla
said. . ‘ '

Werner pointed out that the new
governance plan is independent of
the Pitt ‘Board of Trustees’
resolution authorizing a new
afﬁliation agreement between the
University Health Center and its
member hospitals, which would
result in the closer coordination of
clinical care. The governance plan
deals solely with the academic
program in the hospital.

As -well as opposing the new
governance plan, Monteﬁore op-V’
poses the new afﬁliation agreement
because both plans would give the
University too much control over
each member hospital in UHCP,
according to Kaila.

‘Among the options open to
Monteﬁore if it declines to concur
with the affiliation agreement is
resignation from UHCP.

Energy Conservation Inquiry  

BY RICH HARRY

Problems of energy conservation
in Pitt buildings are currently being
considered by a newly established
energy conservation committee,
Arthur Fedel, associate dean and
the committee’s chairman, dis-
closed at a University Senate
Council meeting Monday.

The Joint Sub-Committee on
Energy Conservation," developed in

conjunction with the Senate’s Plant

Utilization and Planning Committee
and the Chancellor's Advisory
Committee on Energy and Envir-
uument, has been meeting regular-
ly to work on a three-step plan for
energy conservation at Pitt, Fedel
said.

Fedel told Council members

Babcock Room that the ad-hoc

thing but cash.”

School of General Studies Stu-
dent Cabinet member John Della-
vella refuted O’Neill’s support of
the referendum. “If we hold a
referendum for remunerations, why
not hold one for all organization

A allocations? ’ "

Remunerations board member
Tom McAndrew said remunera-

_ tions originally were allocated not

only to -compensate for the time
leaders sacriﬁce, but also to pay for
other expenses incurred by the jobs.
SGB President Barry Weisband
also stressed ‘,“remunerations are
essential to attract responsible
people to responsible positions.”
‘Suggestions to improve the
current remunerations procedure,
in the event remunerations are
retained, alsowere voiced. . _
Assistant Director of Student
Activities Nancy Evans said she felt

. deeper investigation of the credi-

bility of applicants was necessary
and questioned the importance of
advisor input in the application

_ procedure. She said advisers may

prepare their students before the
remunerations. interview and help
them ﬁll out their applications,
giving some students an unfair

advantage.

One student said leaders should
be remunerated on the criteria of
personal ﬁnancial need. Under this
system, the Committee on ‘Student
Organizations would evaluate the
workvput into a position and the

_ Remunerations Board would assign

a dollar value to that . job. The

The committee also will propose

said.

Fedel called on the University to
help offset increasing energy costs
in the future. “Compared to last
year, the University has saved 17.5
million kilowatt hours of electricity
and 25 million pounds of steam,” he
said.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar spoke

‘in favor of the committee and
indicated the possibility of realloca-

_ ting funds for energy conservation.
Posvar’ also reported to the

Council that student registration at -

Oakland has increased .77% and
jumped .72% -for the entire
University system, contrary ‘to
“rumors that enrollment has
dropped drastically at Pitt’? ~

Posvar announced funds for
furnishing the new School of
Nursing are forthcoming and
renovation of Clapp, Langley and
Crawford Halls is underway.

In a comprehensive report,
Herbert Chesler, chairman of the
Senate Athletic. Committee, said
steps have been taken to notify
athletic team coaches of the
academic and eligibility status of
each student athletes-

Chesler added,‘ “In the current
year, the committee will examine
the reasons for a students’ inability
to meet eligibility criteria. The

' committee’s plans call for a review
of the current credits rule.

“Also, the committee plans to
explore the possibility of coding the
transcripts of student athletes to
facilitate retrieval of information-,
making it possible to track academic
achievement on a continuous basis
to make sure there is no abuse of
students or debasement of aca-

. demic values in the University.”

On Secretary of State Henry-

rule in South Africa, Camejo said
that Kissinger is calling for majority
rule to protect American business
interest.

“If Kissinger is interested in the
rights of blacks, why doesn't he call

Camejo-said Kissinger supports
African majority rule to avoid a
national revolt in Africa. “His

replace whice faces with seven
blacks on a 13-member cabinet,”
Camejo said. '

Massey Pompous In Attack

It is unusual for me to take the
any
dispute with faculty members but,
when administrators function as
faculty, their academic freedom is
as important as anyone else’s.
Professor Gerald Massey‘-s attack
on the General Studies course
offered by Associate Provost
Robert Nossen cannot stand
unchallenged. Having = pompously
chosen to write his letter “over his
title”'as President of the Faculty
Senate (not as a mere “philosophy
professor"), Massey has violated
every tenet of democr'atic proce-
dure-and academic freedom. In
order:

‘One: -Perhaps Massey sees
himself as empowered to deter-
mine, on behalf of the entire
faculty, what i course offerings
should be discarded as “rubbish”
and “intellectual corruption” (his
categories). I do not see how any
one faculty member (or 11 for that
matter) can or should be permitted
to take on that task. I have seen no

analysis, no discussion, no record.

of proceedings and no other
evidence to ‘indicate that this
course, apparently offered by a
faculty member in good standing,
should by abolished. I am not
aware that Massey's position of
eminence as the headof the Pitt
Coven of modern scientists entitles
him to issue encyclicals of this sort.

If Massey believes he can use his
office to throw roundhouse punches

at the course offerings of other.

faculty members, he has something
to learn. Has he ever heard of
“due process?” ‘We are in for
some terrible experiences if this is

his approach to Senate “oversight"
of university curricula.

Two: There is a widespread
attempt these days to expand our
knowledge by uniting the meta-
physical and the scientific. Much
of modern science is based solely
on faith anyway, some of it is
directly traceable to alchemist
Isaac Newton, and serious scholars
have described scientists as_ a
secular priesthood laced with
tinges of sorcery. However
defined, sources of evil are a
legitimate field of academic
inquiry. Academic freedom, if it
means anything at all, requires that
qualiﬁed scholars pursue unusual
lines of inquiry (with students)
which seem promising.

I am horriﬁed and shamed by
Massey‘s letter. Having been
elected to a prominent position, he
seems overcome by the “respon-
sibility” and “authority” of his

post. The most dangerous people
are those who believe that they.
and only they, can define ultimate
truth, and that heretics must be
burned at the stake. Massey, in a
few paragraphs, had forfeited any

. bureaucrat to tell them how to fight’

George Murray, in his letter to
the Pitt News of 10/6/76, raises a
number of issues regarding Pitts-
burgh city government that, if not
weak attempts at humor or put-on,
deserve further exploration: °

First, the “teaching" that full
employinent should be reached
through city employment. This will
delight the country's eight million
unemployed, who may now throng
to city halls across the nation, where
they can perform suchuseful tasks
as fixing parking tickets, standing
on street corners and, occasionally,
remodeling Frank Rizzo's home.

Second, the "insanity" of a city
not having a public safety -director.
Since obviously the professional
police and ﬁre chiefs need a

Tenure Alternative

Take notice, associate college
professors, we have an alternate
form of tenure on the rise. All you
need do is affiliate yourself with the
Socialist cause’ or, even better,
teach classes on Marxism. There is_

i very little to remember except that

anyone ‘who opposes you is
pro-industry and pro-military. We
can have a “student” committee
supporting you in a week of your
dismissal.

College is a forum for all political
opinions, that I will grant. But if
any party, minority or majority, can
pressure a college into keeping a
teacher, then not only is tenure
worthless, but so is the whole
review system. I will wait before I
speak further, but let me add this:
Let the Socialists have their say but

.not their way.

l2-ll. lleft immediately. Why?
How the hell can the better of two
players be determined in such a
ridiculously short space of time?

. What is worse is that if you were

victorious, you had to wait around
for hours to play- your next
“match."‘~ It was definitely not
worth the time. To add insult to

injury, the players were allotted no

time for warm-up (althoughimost

had the sense to warm-up). °
The obvious response would be:

“because of the number ‘of

feasible method to play the
tournament." Bull! Isuggest that

crimes and fires, then it follows to
set up an entirely new level of
“supervisors"—a parks supervisor

over the parks director, a public ‘ ‘

works supervisor over the public
works director, etc. This may not
necessarily be more efficient, but at
least it will help provide many of the
eight million jobs needed to reach
full employment, as noted above.
Third, the “demand” for in-
creased taxes. Here Murray raises
an issue of such immense popularity"
that indeed nothing more need be
said aboutit. Those behind this
popular idea can, of course, mail
their checks to the treasury
department, or meet in the phone
booth at Forbes and Bouquet.
Fourth, the senior citizens being
“robbed and maimed" in -their

untaxed homes. Hereit is not clear I

if Murray is referring to the state

program of property tax relief for '

the elderly, in which case Gov.
Shapp also is responsible for this
outrage, or if he merely feels the
elderly would be better robbed and
maimed in TAXED homes. He also,

in this regard, overlooks the similar _

problems of nuns and priests being
ravished and defiled in their
untaxed churches and small chil-
dren being molested and beaten in
their untaxed schools. .

In summary, it seems that
Murray is wasting his time and
talent on such local affairs. I would
suggest his attc:-‘ii-1: be devoted,
instead, to state, -even national
problems, where his incisive
analysis and clear thinking would

provide much needed amusement-

and entertainment.
That is, of course, if there is any

Simple Sensitivity
Is— Not Enough

I am writing to disagree with the
suggestions offered by G. Lee to
deal with the crisis of rape. Simply
being sensitive to women’s feelings
is not enough. Neither is escorting

-. women to their cars and bus stops

the answer to preventing rapes.
By suggesting that women ask
men to escort them to prevent a

‘rape, the author is looking to

increase women’s dependence
upon men for protection and safety.
Men are supposed to be women’s
protectors; men are also the rapists.

His ﬁnal suggestion for increas-
ing security, especially after dark,
was the most valid. Another point
that I would like to make is that the
majority of rapes occur in the
victim's home. So how would the
author's suggestion of escorting
women to cars help to prevent the
majority of rapes?

Lee Misses In
Two Respects

Although I am glad to see that G.
Lee's “rage and horror" have
driven him to express his thoughts
about rape, his article in the Oct. 11
Pitt News misses the point in two
respects._

First: I should have thought that
there was no need even to mention
the “historical myth” that victims
of rape “incite” the rape, or find it
“thrilling or exciting.” This myth is
utterly preposterous. To suggest
that it is controversial by arguing
against it seriously and at length is
insulting to any woman, and’
probably absolutely infuriating to
any woman who has been raped.

Second: The “solution” that Lee
offers to the problem is no less
It is A outrageous to
suggest that women should have to
rely upon the paternalistic benevo-
lence of their "male friends if they
are to be protected from violent
attack. Freedom from violent attack
should not be a favor that one
receives from a friend. It is a right

Presumably, Breton’s list could
be expanded to include the rational
and the irrational.
by placing a supreme emphasis on
reason and science, you place a
major barrier in the way of the
integration of the various aspects of
human conciousness.

Never having been one to take the

- attack on irrationality lightly, Ioffer

the following—

In case you are interested, I have
just invoked a particularly horren-
dous species of demon whose sole
function is to cause the brains of
rationalists to shrivel up and fall
from their cranial cavities like
over-ripe mangoes’. But since you
don’t believe any of this clap-trap,
have a nice day.

J On Intellectual

Corruption

Eleven-professors signed “Astro-
logy—a Question of Intellectual
Corruption" Pitt News (10-4-76)
and I differ somewhat.

“Superstition" is invective, but
is it always‘_ a “burden?” Just
maybe that rabbit foot or conjurer’s
root or lucky number does more to
make life bearable for some people
than might the theory of probabili-
ties. Just maybe the student
interested in astrology or in the
occulty sincerely reads and studies
something to his own liking
(however unscientific) and progres-
ses to reading literature with the .
same attitude. I’ve known parallel
situations. Just maybe someone
casting a horoscope, working with
two bodies of data, learns
something about comparison.-

We can’t be sure’ about
“intellectual corruption” anyway.
With those term paper services the
Pitt News advertises all the time,

,, we’ll never know whether we're
reading . the “intellectual corrupti-

' on” of Pittstudents or of some hack
writer in California who's doing his
bit for moral corruption. If we
assume that academic freedom an.d
all of Pitt’s resources -for learning
will eventually end, such services,
can’t we make the same genial,
sanguine, young assumption about
these old, dark interests of
humankind?

BY BETSY NORMAN

“If you want something done
right, do it yourself” could be the
motto for many Pitt students.

‘,Diss'atif1ed with the Universities

Ftraditional majors, an increasing
number of students prefer to

Vgdesign their own majors.

‘According to Susanna Downie,
advisor for College of Arts and
Sciences self-designed majors, and
Marcia Landy, assistant dean for
Interdisciplinary Studies, a self-
designed major is one of the least
bureaucratic and conﬁning pro-
grams at Pitt.

“This program is designed for
students who don’t want to take all
'30 of their credits toward a major in
one single department. In general,

‘it requires more maturity and the
ability to integrate the diversity of
several different disciplines,”
Downie said.

‘.‘One of our priorities this year is
publicity, through 'the advisors,
residence halls and information
parties, Downie said.

“No one is ever systematically
informed about self-designed ma-
jjors,” Landy said.

-To try to solve that problem, an
information party is going to be
held‘ at 4 p.m. October 20 in the
Student Union, Dining Rooms A
and B, and is speciﬁcally for
freshman and sophomores who
aren't sure of what they want to
major in.

Since the program was intro-
duced in 1971, about 300 Students

  Self-Designed Majors   hrive At P /

have created their own majors.
There are about 100 students
working for self-designed majors
now.

Students who are interested in
self-designed majors usually begin
planning at the end of their junior
year A, according to fandy and
Downie. Each student must submit
a detailed proposal explaining what
particular program the student
wants to study and why. The
student also must find a faculty
member to serve as his academic
advisor. The proposal must then
be approved by the dean.

“Proposals are sometimes

. turned down," Downie said. Some

students according to Downie,
submit proposals that can be
satisﬁed within a standard depart-
ment. Other proposals are turned
down if they are too vague in what
they are trying to accomplish.

“Without exception, these stu-
dents are generally interested in a
subject which is not dealt with to
their own satisfaction within a
single department.” Downie said.

“Some students are very idealis-
tic, but most are down to earth,
with very realistic ideas about their
interests and what education
should do for them. They want to
maximize the ways they can go
about a career by broadening their
undergraduate experience,” she
said. A

The programs of study pursued

‘by self-desined majors are as

diverse as the College of Arts and
Sciences itself. One student
designed a major in meteorology,

combining courses in math, phy-
sics, chemistry and geography.
Another student had aspirations of
becoming a rabbi so he designed a
religious studies major. He took
courses in Jewish studies, black
studies, history, anthropology,
philosophy and political science.
Other self-designed majors are in
the areas of environmental studies,
psychobiology, film studies, mass
media and journalism.

“The self-designed major pro-
gram is an integral part of the
changing curriculum along with

Sheep To The Shears

Like a Biblical sheep being led to _

the slaughter, these young women
meekly submitted themselves to the
stylist’s shears and in a short time,
they emerged from the ordeal with a
new “fall look.” ‘

A crowd gathered around to
watch as Saks Fifth Avenue stylists
efﬁciently snipped and shaped men
and women’s hair for two hours

_ yesterday in the main Towers lobby.

Those who recently paid for a cut
($12 in most area salons) bemoaned
their bad luck. If only they had
waited, they could’ve had a free
styling job. But such is life. Besides
how many people can two stylists do
in as many hours? -

volved with their education, as
each student has the responsibility
to set up his’ own program,"
Downie said.

Independent study plays a large
role in self-designed majors. . One
student took, an entire year to
produce and direct his own
television show while pursuing a
major in communication. Another
student created a major in
consumerprotection and spent a
term serving as an intern to a
legislator in Harrisburg.

While the number of students
choosing -a self-designed major
steadily increases each year,
Downie stresses that. the program
is notfor everyone. The majority of
students, according to Downie,sti_ll
will be capable of finding what they
wzint in the traditional disciplines.

Internships--Great For Job Resumes

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

Applying for a job is difficult at .

best. The password forwinning ajob
seems to be experience.

Internships and fellowships are
one way to get the work experience
necessary for a job upon graduation
andmay be oneway to find out if it's
the type ofljob you want.

There is a place on campus that I

caters to Pitt students internship and
fellowship needs—the Counseling
and Placement Center.

The Counseling and Placement
Center, located on the second ﬂoor of
the Student Union, is a clearing
house for information of this type,
according to Steve Peuquet,
internship coordinator. Counselors
at the Center ‘advise students of
programs and facilitate the applica-
tion process.

Peuquet said the Center tries to
place students in programs that will
provide quality experience. Last
year, more than 150 students sought
help in internship placement at the
center——between 70 and 80 received
their internships through the
Counseling Center.

Peuquet reported that many
students get internships on their

’own, through letters and resumes

sent to various agencies and
companies. For example, many
students receive government in-

Part of the intern’s duties
included researching legislation,
answering constituent letters, at-
tending meetings and running
errands.

.. Besides congressional intern-
ships. major internship programs in
journalism and law are available
through the Center.

' Journalism internships include
working for local newspapers, wire
services, radio ortelevision stations.

Law internships often include
running errandsand doingresearch.

Many internships have stipends,
Peuquet said, varying from between
$25 and $150 per week, depending
on the agency.

Fellowship programs providing

_funds for graduate study also are

available through the Counseling
Center.

“To receive a fellowship, a
student must be enrolled in a
graduate degree granting program
andhaveaminimumQ.P.A.of3.0,”
Roberta Egelston, fellowship advi-
sor, said. She said different
programs may require letters of
recommendation and screening by a
faculty committee.

Students applying for fellowships
should allow one full year for
processing. This means they should
apply by the end ofthejunior year or
the first month of the senior fall
term. Egelston said.

SWINEFLU suors. ‘

PITTSBURGH (AP)—_Med_ical
authorities yesterday reconstructed
events leading to the deaths of
three elderly people who died
within hours of receiving free swine
ﬂu shots in Pittsburgh.

All 13 innoculation sites in
Allegheny County were quickly
‘shut ‘down and Wisconsin authori-
ties suspended the swine ﬂu
program in that state following the

- deaths Monday.

Federal authorities said there
was no evidence to link the vaccine
to the deaths and added that there

” were no plans to discontinue the

“We have absolutely no reason
to believe‘ there R. is as specific
problem with the vaccine,’_’ Dr. W.
Delano Meriwether, the national
director of the ‘innoculation pro-
gram, said in Washington.
. But Allegheny County Health
Department Director Frank Clack
said, “Until we ﬁnd out conclu-
sively whether the vaccine is
involved, we will be studying such
things as the vials the vaccine was
in and surveying other people who
were innoculated from the same lot
as those who died.”

Pennsylvania Health Secretary
Leonard Bachman said he did not

between the shots and the deaths -

and said the state’s vaccination
program would continue.

The three victims all received an
injection to prevent swine flu and

  Bob
  The sto

Bob Dylan was twenty years old when his
first Columbia album,“Bob Dylan.}’was re-
leased. It caused its biggest stir in New
York’s Greenwich.Village where Bob was
a local favorite.The liner notes included a
' reprint of Robert Shelton’s 1961 piece in
The New York Times entitled,“Bob Dylan:
A Distinctive Folk-Song Stylist.”It included
this memora-
ble description
of Bob Dylan:
“Resembling a
cross between
achoirboy and _
a beatnick, Mr.
Dylan has a 
cherubic look
and a mop of
tousled hair he
partly covers with a Huck Finn black cor-
duroy cap. His clothes may need a bit of
tailoring but when he works his guitar,
harmonica or piano and composes new
songs faster than he can remember them,
there is no doubt that he is bursting at the
seams with talent?’ The first album con-
tained a few originals like “Talkin’ New
York” and “Song to Woody” and a lot of
traditional and composed folk tunes
adapted to the emerging Bob Dylan style,
including “House of the Risin’SunI’ “Man
of Constant Sorrow,”“Fixin'to DieZ’“Pretty
Peggy-OI’ “Gospel Plow” and “Freight
Train Blues” -

 

It took Peter, Paul and Mary's recording

of“Blowin' in the WindZ’a tune from Bob -

Dylan’s second album, to direct some na-
tional attention to this new songwriter.
Peter, Paul and Mary followed up their
biggest hit with another tune from “The
Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" album, “Don’t
Think Twice, It’s All Right?’ And the move-
ment was under way. As soon as people got
Bob Dylan’s album and heard songs like “A
Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall’,’ “Masters of

spread. Here

was somebody

who could put

it into words.
Someone that

there

wasn’tmuchof "  

a chance to hear Bob Dylan’s most powerful
songs on the radio, an underground was
born.

The latest words from Bob Dylan disap-
poin_ted no one. His “The Times They Are
A-ChangiJn”’ album took the concept of
“protest music” still another step farther.
And by now the stark Bob Dylan style of
guitar, harmonica,half-singing,half-talking,
was known and accepted (and was being
c o p i e d ) b y ' -
people every
where. The
n e w s o n g s
were exciting:
“With God on
O u r S id e ,”
“One Too Many

“OnlyaPawn in 
Their Game,” ‘

   

'“The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,”

“When,the Ship Comes InZ’“North Country
Blues’,’“Ballad of Hollis Brown” and “Rest-

In the song “My Back Pages” Bob Dylan
questions his role as the guru of young
America. He seems intent on changing his

image with the explanation,“I was so much ”
older then, I’m younger than that now.”
Most of the new songs on“Another Side of
Bob Dylan”are less political,more personal.
“It Ain't Me Babe” drives home the point.
‘All I Really
Want‘ to Doi’
‘Motorpsycho

Blues” and “I
Don’t Believe You” all seem declarations
of freedom from his past. Clues to his
future. Bob Dylan fans wonder what’s next.
Little do they suspect...

Bob Dylan’s first commercial single,
“Subterranean Homesick Blues,”and a half-

. electric,half-acoustic album of“enigmatic,

rocking, funny, great new tunes.That was
next. And with “Bringing It Aﬂ Back
Home," the legend of the ever changing,
always pioneering musical ‘force was born.
The songs confused a lot of people who
thought they

“Highway 61 Revisited” was Bob Dylan’s

And it declared for all the world to hear’

In a 1976 issue of Crawdaddy,-Peter Knobler
said, “No question about it, ‘Blonde on

made.” He’s not the first to feel that way.

probably more wom-out copies of“Blonde

album in American music history.

The first album of “Bob Dylan’s Greatest

Hits” was released during the long interim
- between. “Blonde on Blonde” and “John

Wesley Harding.” It summed up all that had

. gone before, in-

cluding all of
Bob Dylan’s
own hit singles
and some of
his songs that
other people
 had turned in-
to giant hits.
Also, it’s the
onlyBobDylan
album containing his underground classic
single, “Positively 4th Street.” And it comes
‘complete with another classic: The Milton
Glaser/ Bob Dylan poster.

“John Wesley Harding” was a return to sim-
pler things for Bob Dylan. And soon after,
for the entire music scene. It’s a mellow al-
bum with some of the best Bob Dylan vocals
e v e r. A n d .
some of his
most durable
songs, includ-
ing_“All Along
th e W a t c h-
tower,” “Dear
L a n d l o r d,”

“The Ballad of
Frankie Lee
a n d J u d a s
Priest,” “I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,”

“As I Went Out OneMoming,” “The Wicked,»
Messenger,” “I Pity the Poor Immigrant,”

“Down Along the Cove,” “I’ll Be Your Baby
Tonight,” “Drifter’s Escape” and “I Am a
Lonesome Hobo.” .

 

tilt-

The cover of “Nashville Skyline" tells its
story. It's Bob Dylan relaxed, unwound, lay-
ing down his latest country-flavored ditties.
Once again, the music scene quickly picked
up on Bob Dylan’s lead and country-
inﬂugnced mu- . ..  .. . .. ..
sic became the
right direction
to be headed in.
On “Nashville
Skyline,” a new
B o b D y l a n
sings, “Girl
F r o m t h e.
N o r t h C o u n-
try,” with - '

Johnny Cash, “Lay, Lady, Lay,” “I Threw It_
All Away,” “Tonight I’ll Be Staying Here
With You” and “Country Pie.” All very laid
back and enjoyable.

“Self Portrait” tells the story of the conflict
between the old Bob Dylan, the new Bob
Dylan, and the Bob Dylans in between.
They’re all here, including new Bob Dylan
originals, some Bob Dylan oldies revisited

at the Isle of Wight, and, for the first time
in years, some non-original material (like
Paul Simon’s “The Boxer,” Gordon Light-
foot’s “Early
Momin’ Rain,”
“Copper Ket-
tle,” “Alberta,”
“Gotta Travel
On,” “Blue
Moon,” and
“Take a Mes-
sage to Mary”).
Songs that fit
the story Bob
Dylan seems to be telling here._Also on
“Self Portrait” (it’s a two-record set): “Days
of 49,”“All the Tired Horses,” “Living the
Blues,” “Wigwam,” “I Forgot More Than

 

You’ll. Ever Know,” “Little Sadie,” “The A

‘ Mighty Quinn (Quinn the Eskimo) ,”“Let It
Be MeZ’“Belle Isle,”“It Hurts Me Too,”“Min-
strel Boy,” “Take Me as I Am (Or Let Me
Go) ,” among others. _

* * 1!

Every Bob'Dylan hit that wasn't included

’ on the first “Greatest Hits”_album and every

hit that came since is included here, in this‘
two-record set, “Bob Dylan’s Greatest Hits/
Volume II.” There are even a bunch of

songs never before on any Bob Dylan al-

 

bum: “Watch-
ing-the River
Flow,” the

corded with

Leon Russell.
“When I Paint

M y M a s t e r-

piece” and “I

Shall Be Re-

leased,” songs
recorded by The Band. “You 'Ain’t Goin’
Nowhere” and“Tomorrow Is a Long Time,”
recorded by countless people, but never
Bob Dylan. And “Down in the Flood,” an
old favorite from Bob Dylan’s concert days.
Twenty-one great hits in all.’If you have all
the other albums it’s a beautiful luxury. If
you don’t, it’s a necessity.

' 1: It It
In “New Morning" it seems as if the old
Bob Dylan has 
won out. Bob
-Dylanvnever
sounded more
like Bob Dylan.
Andeverysong
is a jewel: “If
Not for You,”
“Sign on the
Window,’ "Day
of the Locusts?
“Time Passes Slowly,” “Went to See the
Gypsy,” “Winterlude,” “If Dogs Run Free,”
“One More Weekend,” “The Man in Me,”
“Three Angels” and “Father of Night.” The

 

/ songs run the Bob Dylan gamut from bitter

to romantic. . .something to _make everyone
realize that despite a decade of changes,

‘ Bob Dylan, and nobody else, is Bob Dylan.

t is It

“Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid” heralds a new

loosening‘-up period for Bob Dylan. With
this album, the
man who shied
away from the

of the public
for so long pre-
-sents his first

 

- movie that lists
among its cast one Bob Dylan, in the role of
Alias. Unlike any other soundtrack in his-

   

single re-.

snooping eye ’

    weaaesaay.   1,3

tory, this one is completely composed and
performed by Bob Dylan, so it’s not like any
soundtrack you've ever heard. Most of it
sounds like Bob Dylan, sitting around with
a few friends, making real nice music. And
as it_ turned out, one of the real nice songs
turned into one of Bob Dylan’s biggest
singles, “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door.”

# It #

No individual in rock has ever heard more

— different interpretations of his songs than

Bob Dylan. On“Dylan;’ Bob reversed roles

with people like Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez,
Jerry Jeff Walker and even Elvis, singing

songs associ-
ated with them

...son gs no-
body would

have expected

him to sing...

and having a .2
good time, '
making it all
sound like...
wonder of , _
wonders...a Bob Dylan album! Here’s the
line-up of tunes: “A Fool Such as I," “Can’t
Help Falling in LoveZ’“Mr. Bojangles? “Big
Yellow Taxi? “Mary Anni’ “Spanish Is the
Loving Tongue? “Lily of the West,” ‘-‘The
Ballad of Ira‘ Hayes” and“Sarah Jane?"

 

t t I

’ “Bob Dylan is back." “Bob Dylan has come
home.”“Album of the century.” The critics
couldn’t say enough about “Blood on the
Tracks? the start of a new period of brutally

personal music making for Bob Dylan. All ‘

that talk about Bob Dylan coming home
was literally (in addition to spiritually) true.

“Idiot Wind”

“Tangled Up in
Blue? and“Lily,
Rosemary and
th e J a c k of
HeartsZ’among
others, were
r e c o r d e d i n
M i n n e s o t a
u sing lo c al
m u s i c i a rt s.
The owner of a local guitar store dropped
by to sell Bob Dylan a guitar and wound up
playing on the session. And the bass player
had to leave mid-session to play a bar date,
so “You’re a Big Girl Now” was recorded
sans bass. Other classics on the “album of
the century” include: “Simple Twist of Fate?

“You're Gonna'Make Me Lonesome When
You Go,”“MeetMe in the Morning,”“If You
See Her, Say Hello? “Shelter From the
Storm” and“Buckets of Rain?’ .

Rolling Stone declared seven albums as
“Albums of the Year” in 1975. Two of them
are on this page...“Blood on the Tracks"
and“The Basement Tapes!’ Though it was,
indeed, released in ’75, the legendary“Base-
ment Tapes”were recorded on a home tape

“Blonde on Blonde” and “John, Wesley

Who could have predicted that the b’ est '

thing to happen to music in 1976 woul be
_Bob Dylan?’ The Rolling Thunder Revue
was headline news as it barnstormed across ~
the country. “Desire? with its haunting new
sound,was the #1 album in the nation for a

' full month. And each of the songs was
treated like a separate, special event by -

reviewers and
radio folk.
“Hurricane? a
hit single and
the theme_ of
some benefit
concerts that
later evolved
into the Roll-
A _ ing Thunder

about underworld figure Joey Gallo. “Sara”
about a girl with the same name as Bob
Dylan’s wife. “IsisZ’ an enigmatic epic.
“Mozambique? the single that was stopped ,
cold in its airplay tracks when a war broke
out in the real Mozambique. “Oh, Sister,"
with the violin of Scarlet Rivera singing

 
   

co-lead. “One More Cup of Coffee?’ ‘‘Ro- ‘

mance In Durangof’ “Black Diamond Bay."
How much more real than this can Bob
Dylan be?

faculty from all the schools of 'the University came to hear a number of outstanding
scholar-teachers talk about their ownareas of research, give personal (and sometimes
controversial) views, and communicate the excitement of learning to the University
community. The talks were followed by lively discussions. —

Encouraged by the reception given to last year’s series, the ofﬁcers of Phi

Chicago Trumpets Old Style

BY TOM WASELESKI

Tuesday Night—What do you say
about a band that’s just blown its
guts out before a near-capacity
Arena, and how do you say it quickly
and succinctly enough for an editor

and a copy desk that’s up waiting to .

put the story to bed?

Do you start by saying Chicago
has rightly inherited the via the
Beach Boys’ default that vast
middle ground of clean, All-Ameri-
can rock?

Do you say that Chicago live is not
Chicago taped, that the band is not
soaked in saccharin as its more
recent albums would have us
believe?

Or do you just go on and on,

‘forget your can of warm Pepsi, and

hammer out on those faded
typewriter keys every cut they
played...

...Like the opener, _ “Begin-
nings.” I would have thought‘ the
band was beyond the days when
they would begin a show with such a
sentimentally appropos song. But it
didn't hurt, despite the fact that the
guitars and drums were much
heavier than the brass section.

Maybe they were in their drive to
let us know they haven’t forgotten
the old days when Chicago and
Blood, Sweat, and Tears used to
bad-mouth each’ other over who had
the toughest brass in'America; we
all know who won that one, but
lately it’s been nice to be reminded.

Keys man ‘Robert Lamm went

into some light introductions,’

announcing trumpeter Lee Lough-
nane was a new daddy, to which
Loughnane replied, “It was oneof
the most important egents of my

life.” Lamm quipped back, ‘.‘And_

it’s all because of this song,” which

cued the band for a dragging
versionof “You Get It Up,” a rocker
from their latest album.

Also from Chicago X was James
Pankow’s “Skin Tight,” a brassy,
full-blown version, a throwback to
the group’s old style.

Lamm introduced a song written
by Terry Kath for the late great Otis
Redding, an unassuming no-holds-
barred rocker called “Once or
Twice,” which blows open X. Lamm
played his ﬁngers ragged on the
piano while the brass backed him to
the hilt with some of their strongest
stuff.

“Old Days” was a disappoint-
ment, ‘the guitars and drums once
again forcing the horns to take a
back seat. This is a problem
Chicago’s had the second half of
their decade. They keep forgetting
that they're primarily a brass band.
‘El don’t think they’ve evolved into
anything else. They think they
have, and have loused a couple of
albums proving" themselves
wrong.',-

On this one the horns didn’t even
play the ﬁnal refrain, the crowning
piece to the whole song; they let
Kath carry it through on his electric
guitar.’ In a nine-man band that’s
called ‘dogging it.

“Ballet for a Girl in Buchanan”
(written for a girl in Buchanan
County, West Virginia), the suite
that contains “Make Me Smile”
and “Colour My World,” brought
the crowd to its feet for the
intermission, which, by the way,
was a great idea.

Saying a lot about wliat kind of
audience Chicago’s drawing these
days, the old applause meter went
haywire, when the group slipped
into their current hit, “If You Leave

Good-Times, Music

BY M. PATRICK MONAHANN

With Cavanaugh and Haygood
out for the season, mid-terms
approaching, and the mundane
reality of attending classes testing
the patience of the most‘devoted
Pitt student, It’s no wonder people
are crooning the blues.

They’ve hit me and you, but what
can we do to drive them away for a

‘ few precious minutes of tranquility?

Crawl the walls of our cramped dorn
rooms? Kick the stray dog who used
our feet as his personal toilet?
Shove a bottle of Jim Beam down
our thrill-starved throats?

Too violent, and not
satisfying, you say. Well how about
trying. Doc Monahan’s clinically
tested remedy, a quick blast of
good-time music.

That’s right, good-time music.
Music that lets us forget our

A. burdens, assignments and woes,

taking us to that foreign plane of
personal joy and contentment.

My personal dosage comes in
many wrappings and sizes. It could
be-"a song by Rod Stewart and the
Faces, a whole side of rock n’roll
delivered by.Foqghat, early Beatles,
of cowboy tales by the New-Riders of

the Purple Sage, but it always works «

won ders.

really’

 

Of course there is so much‘ mass
produced crap that doesn't fall into
the category of good-times songs.

Disco is out; we only like it because ’

we’re told to like it by radio stations.

Protest songs make us think; but 4

don’t release the happy beast within
us. They were written for the 60s,

when people thought they had a‘.

chance to‘ change the system.
Good-times music is universal, it is

unique to each of us, without .

shoving messages down our
throats, _
We feel safe with good-time
music. The content 1S light and the
de“Ve1‘Y Pleasing. When was the
last time you heard Foghat trying to
solve the world’s problems in a
5lX‘minllte. high-energy piece? Or
Rod Stewart discussing the prob.
lems of growing up at age 17?
N_eVer. These guys are concerned
with partying all night long, having
a goodtime and recovering so they
can do it again at tomorrow night's
party. ‘

Whales may.be dying all over the
world at an extinction pace, the city
government may be raising taxes
and Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
may be debating in front of millions
°f A-me1'1C3nS._ but what can we do‘

.(C0.nti7iz.zed an ‘Page 18)

"Me Now,” which is actually a

deplorable song. ,
But one readily noticed the canes

tapping against arena ‘seats and

hearing aids being adjusted for

-“Twenty-Five or Six to Four,” the

selection that seemed to appeal
most «to. oldtimers._

“I’ve Been Searching So Long”
went along, ﬁne until they tried to
replace that long orchestral section
with heavy metal, a mistake of the
first degree.

As an encore, the band took on
the Beatles in the kind of song these
guys should be attempting, “Got to
Get You Into My Life.” It could’ve
been tailor-made for Chicago. The
brass came through, Kath hung
back on lead guitar, and we were all
the happier for it.

And then. “Feelin’ Stronger
Every Day” has a sentimental
attachment to me that won’t be
gone into here. The cl‘ock’s passed
into the twilight zone, it’s a new
day, and my editor has begun
chewing on ﬁle cabinets. The copy
desk stomped out long ago.
Anyway, they ended the evening
with this, the most driving piece this
band’s done to date, and if I had to

do it over, I’d pay the $7.50 justto .

see them do this song.
Goodnight, Pitt. '

The Mellowing of the Bigot

BY RON NYSWANER

Archie Bunker, t'elevision’s ﬁrst
prime time bigot, had a controver-
sial beginning in 1969 as a loud, and
very funny, anti-hero. Some’
declared that he and his show, All in
the Family, would revolutionize
television.

Its premise, according to the
disclaimer that preceded each
installment during the ﬁrst year,
was to illustrate that bigotry comes

the ratings scale. , '
But something happened: We
began to like Archie Bunker. Carrol
O’Connor, too good -an actor to
depend upon easy patterns, added
more dimensions to the bigot. We
saw him hold Edith’s hand, or smile
at his daughter, and we came to
know a gentler, more understand-
able Archie. '

In the house across the street,

      Pitt'Ponders erback Dilema

BY CRIS HALL

The question to Johnny Majors at
yesterday's Pitt football luncheon
was, "Are you going to make any
changes in your offense?” .

A good question, considering that
the Panthers do not have an
experienced quarterback available
for Saturday's date with Miami
(Fla.) and that Pitt's present setup,
the veer, demands a great deal from
that position. ' .

Although Pitt has enjoyed grea

success recently using the vecr,_

.Majors’ ﬁrst two Panther teams
attacked out the of I formation.

So, Majors was asked, can Pitt
f'ans expect tolsee anything new at
Pitt Stadium Saturday? Maybe the
I? is Majors ready to abandon the
veer? '

“I think we'd be crazy to do
that," the Pitt coach said. “There's
a limit to what you can do with
young men, and you can't just junk
an offensive setup.",

Does that mean there will be no
new wrinkles in the offense, veer or
no veer? I

 page)-zdxrnr§i2ir*r'i<1i€ws;Wéa'ii¢my;'oct¢i3e;’f'i'3'."197s 

“I haven't fully decided that
yet."

Ohi. _

What Majors has decided is that
he isn't going to say anything about
his offense before Miami's Hur-
ricanes whirl into Pitt Stadium. And
he'd be crazy if he did. So, two
answers to approximately the same
question.

Not only is Majors not saying
anything, but also he doesn't want
anyone else spilling the formations
either. So, for the first time since
the Notre Dame game, practices are
closed.- Not even the Golden
Panthers can attend this week's
practices.

Down to three inexperienced
quarterbacks, one of whom must
lead the offense Saturday, Majors is
taking no chances. None of the
three will take part in Friday's JV
game, and no one on the squad will

. - scrimmage this week.

 

‘ ‘We can’t afford to scrimmage, ".
Majors said, mindful of the fact
many second- and third- (and even‘
fourth-) teamers may see action
against Miami.

 

Pitt’s TonyDorsett, shown sliding through one of the many puddles at

the Louisville game last Saturday, will need to stay on his feet more for
the rest of the year if he is to keep pace with Southern CaI’s Ricky Bell,

 who has outrushed him, 1,075 yards to 660 so far.

'1} Q»

in

When the 1976 season began for the Pitt Panthers
and Robert. Haygood and Matt Cavanaugh were
running the offense, not a son] would have guessed

Another thing Pitt cannot afford
to do is allow Miami to score many
points. Senior linebacker Arnie
Weatherington, who will leave Pitt
with the school record for career
tackles, said the defense is ready.

"We've been playing well all
year," Weatherington said of the
defense. “But we'll have to play
our best game of the year because
we know Matt (Cavanaugh) won't
be in there." .

The offensive line also will be
counted upon to perform will
against Miami, since Pitt’s running
pair of Tony Dorsett and Elliot
Walker should work overtime
Saturday.

“We'll have a little more
pressure on us than is usual because
we'll have to keep Miami off
whoever is back there (at quarter-
back)," tackle John Hanhauser
said.

Hanhauser, a senior from Erie,
said the offensive line's job will be
made harder by the adjustment to a
new signal-caller.

“You have to ‘get used to a
quarterback," he said. There are
different cadences and differences
in the huddle...but we’ll’be ready‘

after a week of preparation."

Majors used to use the word
acceleration to describe Dorsett’s
gift of knifing through the line (and
secondary). Now he employs it

Golfers Go Out Swinging

BY JIM PANE

The Panther golf team ended its
fall season in style Monday by
defeating Rober Morris and St.
Francis in a three-team inatch.

After a poor showing in last
Tuesday's Allegheny College Tour-
nament in Meadville, Pitt came
back to shoot a 401, easily beating
out host team Robert Morris (421)
and leaving St. Francis 42 strokes
back.

Pitt's effort was led by Jim

Pitzsimons and Bill Burkhardt, both
shooting 78s to tie with Robert
Morris‘ Don Emeric for medalist
honors. The Panthers‘ Bob Kurey
finished "three shots off the pace
with an 81.
' Through the first six matches, the
Panthers had their troubles in
tournament play (fifth place being
their best finish), but they looked
impressive when up against head
head competition in’ dual- or
three-team matches.

Commenting on his squad's up
and down performances, coach
Steve Petro said, “I'm happy in that

they've improved and were a little

more competitive than last year."

that every player on the team knew
he could be beaten out of the
starting six.

The women's cross countfy
program at Penn State reminds one
of the way its football program, until

‘recently, dominated the eastern‘

collegiate scene. ' Last Sunday's
Ninth Annual Kettering, Ohio,
Invitational gave the Lady Lions yet
another opportunity to show their
claws as they won the 14-and-over
women's team title by 78 points.
Generally,
slower than usual. The combination
of 45-degree weather, sharp winds
and an\often treacherous course

the 1976-77 campaign by mid-
March with the next match slated to
be sometime in early April.

Sciullo, Karen Cerutti and Sue
Miller placed 45th, 64th, 74th and
77th, respectively, for the Panther-
ettes. .

Of the 94 runners entered in the
women's-category, about 14 found
the course to be too much of a
challenge. The path included
-several streams and angular hills
which resembled the equestrian
Grand National.

“I kind of liked the course,”
remarked Cerutti. “Of course, it
was very hard, but it was different
fora change.’p’.

‘ A total of 33' teams representing

Pitt Takestllie “West” out
or wvu And West l.iberty

BY JIM LEWIS

When Horace Greeley uttered his
famous‘ quote, "Go West, young
man," he must have been talking
to the Pitt men's tennis team.

The Panthers “weiit West" over’

the weekend, facing t_wo western
teams in their fall season o'peners--
West Virginia and West Liberty--
and the outcome was more golden
than the hills of California.

On Friday, Pitt squeaked by the
Iuugh Mountaineers, ‘for the first
time sii_ice'l972, 5-4, then squashed

Liberty, 8-1, at "the Trees‘ Hall’

courts on Sunday.

At WVU, rain forced the match 7

indoors, .wh'ere they-decided to play
by pro set rules (the first player to
win eight games wins the set).

And so the Panthers played like

-pros. in singles play, sophomore
sensation Joe Sakalik started things
off by dodging Dart Meadows, 8-5,
for a quick 1-0 lead.

I-reshman Tom Liebenguth, the
P.l.A.A. State Tennis champ last
year, padded the lead to 2-0 with an
8-6 victory over Eddie Parker.

After the Mountaineers closed
the gap to 2-1, freshman Kevin
Quay crushed WVU's Steve Lauria,
8-4, and Harry Habbel downed
Mark Leherre, 8-6, for a 4-1 lead
which Pitt held on,-' despite a late
Mountaineer surge.

' lhe doubles play, however, was
not quite as impressive. The
number one doubles team of Sakalik
and Mike H_abbel came back‘ to steal
a 2-6, 7-6, 7-5 heartthrobber for a
S-2 lead, but it was the only doubles

because the number ' two and

much chance to play together," Pitt

Sunday, however, was a different
story. .

number two and three doubles
teams,’ branded helpless West,.:,,_,

The number two doubles team of

Hank Olsyesky, 7-5, 6-3. ,

It was the same old story in -1!

tion. Sakalik, Liebenguth} Mike
Habbel, Quay, Harry Habbel and »
Gary Mosso each devastated their’ ' '

0-Udlead and theirrsecond fall win in
two attempts. ,

All in all Dieffenbach was pleased;
withhis team's (2-0) performances
as they executed everything they
had been practicing.

"in our practices, we've been
working on teamwork, strategy and  
volleys after serves," Dieffenbaciij. 
said. “We've been takiifg a look at if
a lot of new players." '

it that's the case, then Dieffe‘n-

BYSTEVESYBERT

With the northeastern section of
the United States all but conquered,
the Pitt water polo team will travel
to Michigan this weekendfto play in
a tournament said to be representa-
tive of the best water polo teams in
the nation outside of the far west.

The Panthers upped their 1976
record to 5-1 (5-0 in the.
Mid-Atlantic Water Polo confer-
ence) by sweeping through the
Cornell Tournament last ‘weekend,
three of their

_ opponents, among them somervery

fine competition. . . A

Pitt rolled over LaSalle, 32-10, on
Friday with Jorge Machicote
leading the way with‘ eight goals.
Luis Toro added five and Butch
Silva contributed four t_allies against
LaSalle, playing its first season in
NCAA Division I after winning the '
Division II championship in 1975,
The entire Pitt squad scored in the
game and committed no turnovers.
A day later, the Panthers faced
Richmond, whose coach is from
Hungary where water polo is’ a

national sport, and again won rather .

handily, -16-8, with Toro taking
command this time with six goals,

‘BY DAVE MeDONALD

1 Pitt's cross country team
started its dual meet season Friday

,on the right foot, but it was slippery

going. The Panthers ﬂoated into
Morgantown. in a cool, breezy
drizzle and drifted- to a. 19-43
victory. A

Mel Boyd outsloshed the ‘rest of
the field to win in a _slow,
rainsoaked 25:33 for individual
honors in the ﬁve-mile race.

The hilly, grassy goal course was
well saturated prior to thestart of
the meet and the swamps on the
course made for a tougher race.

    Cox Alive And Kicking

BY KAREN KADILAK

As Tony Dorsett continues his
assault on the NCAA record books,
another Pitt product, unknown to
many, is playing havoc with the pro
football record manual.

Fred Cox, to the casual football
fan, is the placekicker for the
Mininesota Vikings. The occasional
fan probably also knows that the

- Vikings are perennial - participants
in the National Football League
post-season extravaganza popularly
known as _“the play-offs” and that
Cox and his golden right toe, PITT
PRODUCTS, are two of the
principal reasons why the Vikings
find themselves in such an
advantageous position year in and
year out. _

What generally eludes even the
astute eye of the true football freak,
however, is the fact that Cox ranks
third in NFL lifetime ‘scoring with
1,227 points behind such legendary

A ﬁgures as recently retired George

Blanda, of the Geritol set, and the

' Cleveland Browns’ powerful place-

kicker and tackle Lou “The Toe”
Groza.

Although those close to the pro .

football beat assume that Blanda’s
plus 2,000-point career mark is-' out
of reach for Cox’s 37-year old toe,
Groza’s 1,608 career point total
appears within reach of the
Monongahela native. '

If Cox Continues to boot the
pigskin through NFL uprights with
the consistency his lifetime, .638
ﬁeld goal percentage suggests, he
should in fact overtake Groza within
the next few seasons.

Of course, whether the 14-year
veteran does depends on his ability
to escape serious injury or any other
unforeseeable circumstance which
may occur; “unforeseeable circum-

stances” -in this case include Cox

turning"his attention and energy
full-time to his chiropractic practice
in Buffalo, Minn.

‘ “At my age, I’m just taking one

' season at a time,” Cox said with a

chuckle following an early pre-

season game with the Dolphins in
Miami's Orange Bowl.

“I’m kicking the ball reasonably
well,” Cox continued, a serious
expression replacing the smile
which adorned his face. “Hope-
fully, we’ll be able to challenge for
the play-offs again this year.”

It's a fact of NFL life that Super
Bowl talk doesn’t enter into the
picture until the necessary play-off
games are won. To the football
pros, it’s nice to think about a Super
Bowl ring, but to discuss it freely,
well, that’s a different matter.

    
  

Pitt News

Sports  

With Minnesota, however, poss-
essing the cool and smarts of head
coach Bud Grant, the golden arm of
1975 NFL MVP Fran Tarkenton
and_, of course, last but not least, the
goldentoe of Cox, such conversation
doesn it seem really premature."Add
Super Bowl experience "(the Vikes
were two-time Super Bowl visitors,
only to be defeated twice; once‘by
two-time winner Pittsburgh) and
the Vikings are genuine contenders

* for the Lombardi Trophy, symbollic

of pro football excellence.

To Cox, it must be refreshing to
achieve the success he has so far,
yet alone be able to perform for a
Super Bowl -contender such as
Minnesota.‘

‘his pro career was hardly conducive
to such success.

' After a successful‘ varsity stint
under John Michelosen from 1960

to 1962 at Pitt, where he was a back.

in addition‘ to .his punting and

Westminster (1-0 prior to playing

Slippery Rock, but the Pantherettes
had put forth a ﬁne effort. It looked

The early going found Westmin-

couple of times, they actually came
close to scoring. When the
Pantherettes got control of the ball
midwaythrough the half, they did
no better. The halftime score was
0-0.

The second half consisted of a lot
of racing back and forth. Finally
when it looked like neither team
would score, Pitt left wing Sue
Swick slammed in the winning

not hide her disappointment.
“We played very poorly,” she
‘said. ‘‘It was a poorly executed
game. Wevweren’t thinking. We

to score what we did. Westminster

normally." ‘

such NFL nonentities as Tom
Franckhauser, Charley Ferguson
and Errol Linden for a sixth round
draft choice. Ironically, the Browns
traded Cox since they already had a

kicker with a pretty good reputa- V

tion—none other than Groza.
Cox was cut that same year, but
with the determination and verve
which were to become trademarks
of his distinguished pro career, Cox
returned to make the Vikings in
1963 and kicked off what has been
the essence of the Great American
Dream. The underdog who made
good.
Now, 255 ﬁeld goals and 462
conversions later, Cox is a remnant
of that 1962 Panther squad, which
also produced future pro standouts
Mike Ditka and Ed Sharockman in
addition to Cox, still playing for pay.
A twist or irony, in fact,
surrounds the above triumvirate
and their respective pro careers.
Ditka, considered by many to be the
ﬁnest tight end to play profession-
ally and certainly the ﬁrst to
revolutionize the position to- the
ultrasophistication we identify it
with today, was one of the main cogs
of the Pitt offensive line which
provided the holes for the 5-10, 200 '
pound Cox. ’ ' ‘
Meanwhile, Sharockman was
selected by the Vikings the same
year Cox was grabbed by the
Browns. Unlike, Cox, however,
Sharockman had a successful rookie
season and eventually become one
of the mainstays of the famed
Viking “Purple People Eaters”
defense before .- his retirement in
’72.
Although Cox makes his home on
a farm in Delano, Minn. and runs
his chiropractic office in nearly
Buffalo,.he makes it a point to keep
up his ties with the Pittsburgh area.

In fact, this past June, Cox and
his wife Elaine and their four
children visited Monongahela,

where Cox, who holds .a degree in

education in addition to his Doctor
of Chiropractic certiﬁcate, once
taught school.

DEBATES EXEMPT FROM
“EQUAL TIME“ DEMANDS

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
Supreme Court yesterday declined
to consider an “equal time”
challenge to this year’s televised
presidential debates and to news
conference held by candidates.

The court refused to review a
Federal Communications Commis-
sion ruling that political debates

‘ and news conferences by candi-
dates are exempt from the equal

time principle.

The equal time doc_trine shaped
by Congress in 1934, says that if
one candidate is given use of
broadcast facilities, other qualified

7"’:
2::

candidates for the same Ofﬁce must .

be given the same Ofﬁce must be
given the same opportunity.

The court, with only Justice
Byron R. White recording his
disagreement with the decision,
said it will not consider an apeal to
it by the Democratic National

«.2»:

Committee, Rep. Shirley Chisholm, _

D-N.Y., the Naitonal Organization
of Women and the Ofﬁce of
Communication of the United

. Church of Christ.»

The television networks, the‘FCC.
and the League of Women Voters,

sponsor of the debates between the 9

presidential and vice presidential
and vice presidential candidates,
had urged the court to let the FCC
ruling stand. '

CLIMBERS REACH ._ 4
MT. EVEREST SUMMIT '

EVEREST BA’SE CAMP,
Nepal (AP)—-—When Bob Cormack
finally got to the summitﬁof Mt.
Everest, he looked around to the
edge of the world while hurricane
winds howled and said to himself:
“I better get the hell out of here.”

Something similar passed
through the mind‘ of Chris Chandler
as he, too, » skirted 10,000-foot
drops and reached the top last
Friday. .

“The winds were over 100 miles
per hour and we could hardly stand
up. It was late in the afternoon. I

- asked myself what am I doin

here," Chandler said. -

Chandler, 28, of!Seattle, Wash.,
and Cormack; 30, or Boulder,
Colo., said they were too concerned
with survival to spend much time
on the- summit savoring the
triumph of the U.S. Bicentennial
Everest Expedition.

‘‘It was a crumby day to climb
Everest,” Cormack said. The wind

‘ was so strong, he said, that on the

way up he had to squat down for. a
few minutes every 10 step '

The two men, roped about 100
feet apart, were helped up‘ the
steep Hillary Step just below the
summit by a ﬁxed rope they found
left over from another expedition.
“If either of us had made a mistake
it would have been‘ all over because
there were 10,000-foot drops on
either side," said Chandler.

Exhausted and ‘cold, ' the two
nevertheless spent half an hour on
the summit at 29,028 feet taking
pictures and gazing down into the
clouds over Nepal and on. to the
plains of Tibet. . ‘

- “Here I am on the‘ summitof

»: Everest,” Cormack r_ern_embered..
‘,-‘I could hardly _believ_e.
