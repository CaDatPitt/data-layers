Abolished For Student

ByALJANEZIC

Student Government may help save college students   

 

throughout the state over a million dollars this years and 1  __;>
at the same time funnel $3200 proﬁt from the Universi'ty’s’3. ; 
athletic department to more directly beneﬁt students. —  

By so doing, University students may receive a 15 per :7 V

$1 identiﬁcation card fee to student organizations.
At its ﬁrst meeting Thursday night, President John Vrana in-

structed SG senators to get 1,500 students signatures protesting the "

high amount of sales tax on

PRESIDENT John. Vrana explains by gesturing at Student Govern-
ment’s ﬁrst fall meeting on Thursday when SG discussed abolishing
the state’s ﬁve per cent sales tax on text books and getting a ten per

cent discount at the Book Store.

Players Hold Open House

“An Evening with Chekhov and
Benchley” will be the theme of
Pitt Players’ open house tonight
at 8 p.m. in the Steven Foster

Memorial Auditorium. The pro-_

gram will feature two one-act
monologues: Anton Chekov’s On
the Harmful Effects of Tobacco
a-nd Robert Benchley’s The Treas-
urer’s Report.

The monologues will be de-
livered by Wandalie Henshaw, a
member of the University The-
atre staff, and Lawrence Bloom,
a ‘speech pathologist presently

taking his doctorate at the Uni-
versity. ‘ '
Main purpose of the open house

is to attract more participants in‘

the Pitt Player's expanding the-
atre program. “The University
Theatre will be undertaking an
ambitious project when it pro-
duces Measure for Measure,” pre-
dicted William Kingsley, advisor
to Pitt Players. “We will need the
help of many people to make
this show a success. We hope that
our open house will attract all
of them,” Kingsley concluded.

books and supplies sold in the
Book Store and asking for a ten
per cent reduction for graduate
and undergraduate students.

Sampling Opinion

By sampling student opinion,
SG hopes to generate enough en-
thusiasm to lodge an official pro-
test of the state’s sales tax with
Gov. William Scranton.

Interest in the program was
kept alive when Senator Jerry
Hogan told SG that two years
ago there was no sales tax on
books and supplies sold here.

Hogan explained that the state’s
total sales tax revenue per year
is $517 million. Of this, he said,
college textbook intake amounts
to $1,059,000.-

 

Frat QPA Higher
Than All Men’s

_ By JACKI KATZ

For the ﬁrst time in the history of the University,
the all fraternity scholastic average is higher than the all
men’s scholastic average. According ‘to statistics, the all
fraternity Quality Point Average for the last Winter term
Was 2.440, While the all men’s was 2.438.

Of the 13 fraternities on the University campus, 11 improved,
according to Parker Enwright, assistant dean of men. “This is almost
unprecedented improvement,” Enwright commented.

‘ This fraternities with the highest averages receive scholarship
awards which are divided into three classes; the highest chapter
average, the highest pledge-class average, and the greatest im-
provement.

Pi Lam Highest

Pi Lambda Phi won the highest chapter average and the highest
pledge class average awards. Other winners in these two divisions
are: highest chapter average—Theta Chi, second; and Delta Tau
Delta, third; and highest pledge-class average——Delta Sigma Phi, sec-
ond; and Delta Tau Delta, third.

Delta Tau Delta won the «award for showing the greatest im-
provement with Pi Lambda Phi second and Theta Chi third. First
place winners in all three divisions will receive plaques.

A new custom is being started this year in order to broaden the
base of recognition for scholarship, according to Enwright. Any
fraternity whose active chapter, pledge class, or full chapter (actives
and pledges) QPA is above 2.5 will be accorded Honors by the Dean
of Men’s Office.

Commendations Given

If a chapter’s QPA is below 2.5, but is still above the all frater-
nity or the all men’s average, they will be accorded comm.endations,
according to Enwright.

Those fraternities receiving Honors for the winter trimester,
1964, are: active chapter—Alpha. Phi Alpha, Delta Tau Delta,
Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi Lambda Phi, Sigma Alpha, Epsilon, Theta Chi,
and Delta Beta Tau. Delta Sigma Phi and Pi Lambda Phi won
Honors for pledge class average and Pi Lambda Phi and Theta
Chi won full chapter Honors.

Full chapter Commendations went to Delta Tau Delta, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau. Delta Tau Delta also received a
pledge class Comendation.

Notiﬁcations Sent

Official notiﬁcation of Honors or Commendations received will.

be sent to the individual fraternity, its national, and its alumni. The

notiﬁcation will also be entered ‘on the fraternity’vs official record
. with the University. ‘       ‘ I."  ‘.1

Withdrawal, Change Payments Differ

Policy Switched

The University has inaugurated a new policy in regard to with-
drawing from and changing courses. Students who withdraw from
a course on or prior to September 19, the second Saturday after com-
mencement the regular term, will be refunded the amount of tuition

noted Hogan.
With a reduction of the state’s

ﬁve per cent sales tax on col- 0.
lege books and supplies, he es- »

timated that students could
save approximately $2 on a

$410 purchase. This reduction, i

he claimed, coupled with the

Book Store's tenpercentdis-i 

count, would save a student
about $6 on a $40 purchase.

A motion was then unanimous-
ly passed to oppose Pennsyl-
vania’s sales taxon school sup-
plies.

cation cards came in for criti-
cism from Senator John Dugan.

Notes Cost
He, along with Vrana, cited the
department for charging each

student $1 for an ID card which _ VS --

costs $.62 apiece.

This resulted in a proﬁtiof  7
$3,200 to the athletic depart» I

ment last yeaa',“Dugan said.
He therefore proopsed a mo-
tion, passed unanimously, to ask

be paid when applicable. ' -

Withdrawal by students from
a course after the second Satur-
day after the regular term be-
gins prevents them from receiv- . 
ing a refund of tuition and. fees  ‘V
applicable to the course. Stu-
dents who withdraw from short-
term programs will not receive
any refunds either.

Students are permitted to  
change courses or sections until
the ﬁrst day of the term without
imposition of a change of course  -
charge. Afterwards a fee of $1.00  
per credit is charged, with »_a 
minimum charge of $5.00 and a,
maximum charge of_ $15.00.

For students enrolled in grad-
uate and professional programs,
there will be a change of course W
charge imposed, -based on resi-
dence.

Students wil not be charged
for course or section changes that
are initiated by the University.

OFFICE SPACE
Applications for office space
in the Student Union are avail-
able at the SU desk through

Reviews:

By VIJAY JAIN

The 1964 Owl will not
bring the sensational com-
ments that last year’s
prompted; for the present
book seeks to present col-
lege life as it occurred without
superimposing upon it the edi-
torial comment about loneliness
at the University, which pervaded
the previous issue.

_ The University has been spared
biting comments about its in-
adequacy and the book is one of
sufficiently high quality that the
Hierarchy will be able to present
it to their inﬂuential friends as
a true student impression of the
year.

The yearbook. follows the es-
tablished organization in present-
ing its abbreviated subject mat-
ter with .a few minor variations
from the past years. The “Great
Professor” section has been elim-
inated, which is unfortunate since
it gave the teachers much de-
served credit for their valuable
contribution to the student’s edu-
cation process.

The greater depth and quality
of picture reproduction in part
of the introductory section shows
the scope of the sophisticated FM

CHOIR REHARSALS

sic for the 11 am interdenom-
inational University Service, is

printing process employed.

The pictures used, however, do
not warrant the more expensive
process. The introduction section
is one of the best parts of the
book.

The addition of a section on
regional campuses, though a very
good idea does not really give a
view of the campus to the Oak-
land student by the choice of the
pictures or the essay accompany-
ing it. The section on schools,
however, is well executed, but
with a little weakness in the
writing.

The “Organization” section has
the best pictures and the problem’

, of group photographs is very

well handled by variation in
poses. The athletic section of
good action shots, but some of
them are too light.

.“Owl’ Hall of Fame” pictures
are of good quality both in ap-
pearance and in posing the per-
sons. “Senior” section, too, is
good, as usual, and the idea of

' giving full names rather than last

name and initials is an improve-
ment.

student handbook, contains
the sundry facts, faces, in-
formation and messages
that are requisites of such a
publication. The presentation and
arrangement of the information
distinguishes one year’s publica-
tion from another; this year’s
efforts compare rather unfavor-
ably with past publications.
With a few exceptions, the
freshmen photos are of uniform
quality and have been cropped to
size properly. The elimination of
a separate section in which fresh-
men addresses were given and
the incorporation of them with
the pictures is a good innovation.
The change from a vertical book
to one that is horizontal pro-
vides more space in the calendar
section and is welcome.
Additional illustrations add col-
or to the book. The color pictures,
however, detract from the .ap-
pearance of the book. Most color
pictures are off register and
fuzzy. The pictures themselves
have not been tastefully selected
to warrant the additional cost
incurred. "

Information Placement Good

The placement of all informa-
tion together before the calendar
is a basically good idea; the ar-
rangement of the information,
however, is not in the most or-
ganized manner, Two pages of
copy in blue is an unfortunate
decision.

Except for the action athletic
shots, the photography is in
need of improvement. The lay-
out is not of a high quality: it
alternates between crowding
the copy into too little space so

that segments of information ‘

are lost, and wasting space that

could have been valuably em-

ployed.
Dabbled Cover

What should have" been left
out instead is the cover. The
printers could have replaced the
dabbings by anything and 911'
hanced the quality of the C0V€I‘
a hundred per cent.

The book could have been a
ﬁrst class one had color been
excluded and had services of a
staff with more insight been em-
ployed in all departments.

, The chancellor wants to improve
the educational plight of the women.
. With this View in mind more Women
are being encouraged to go into ca-

’ - attached to the
‘dean of Women’s
office. Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld’s concept of
what a woman’s
education should
consist of and
that of Dean Hel-
en Poole Rush are
quite different. So
it is interesting
- that the objective
" JAIN of the ﬁrst has
been entrusted in the care of the
, second. '
 The fact that nearly 40 per cent
of the incoming freshmen class are
‘women attests to the fact that wom-
,_- ~en and their parents agree, at least
Tin part, with Dr. Litchﬁeld’s vision

 women in every ﬁeld of knowledge
and endeavor.
~ The increase in- the number of
women seeking post graduate work
 and their entrance in many of the

"recently been considered the protec-
torate of the men alone, all point
to the changing tide. Thus it is of

has the interest of the’ University
at heart and would no doubt like to
see the women play an ever increas-
ing role of importance in the affairs
of this country. Her version of the
type of education that the coed
should have, none the less doe-s not
coincide with that of the chancellor.

Dean Rush’s type of education
would stress the Women’s role in
the capacity as mother and home
maker ﬁrst and that of leader in
business and administration of the
country second. This View is a fair
and correct one to an extent due
to the biological attributes of a
woman. But it comes in conﬂict with
the views of Betty Friedan, author
of The Feminine Mystique, who con-
tends that women do not have any
conﬂict of interest in having both a
career and being a housewife.

The very fact that emphasis has
to be placed on Women’s education
proves that it is different from that
of the men. It alsoipoints to the fal-
lacy that both the roles are of‘ equal
importance. Both roles have been
successfully undertaken by women
but the emphasis has been by no
means equal f‘or both in any case.
Some career women have been home-
makers ﬁrst and career women sec-
ond or vica versa.

THE CHANCELLOR and Dean
Rush are thus approaching the
same problem with the same ob-
jective in mind but have different
views on the matter of emphasis
between the two alternate and often
complementary roles that a woman
can and often does play.’

A second proposal in the same vein asks a ten per
cent reduction for the University community at The Book
Center. Staff members and University employees already
enjoy this privilege, but as far as the students are con-
cerned, they hear high words in the classroom about
building libraries and ﬁnd prices to match in their Uni-
versity book store.

Finally, the proposal to rechannel the profit the Ath-
letic Department is making on the Student ID cards back
into student activities will not mean a 28 cent return to
each individual student. Rather a $3200 bundle will be
distributed to student organizations.

If the ﬁrst SG meeting is a true indication of the
serious tenor of this year’s student leadership, the winter

easy answer to which of the -two ap-
proaches is the best. Dr. Litchﬁeld
Wouid provide the University facil-
ities to women and encourage them
to utilize them to the utmost and
leave the problem of Whether the
coed should be a housewife ﬁrst
unanswered and up to the the indi-
vidual student. Dr. Rush, on the
other hand, in her role as dean of
women faces the problem and has
her view on it which she passes on
to the coeds from her actions.

Thus the aspirations for women
of Chancellor Litchﬁeld as shared
by President Johnson are high and
commendable. The problem that has
been posed for Dean Rush and does
exist must be faced squarely before
this or any other university’s proj-
ect to promise higher education for
women can prove to be of value and
meet with success. It may be impor-
tant to do something about higher
education for women at an early
date but it is even more important
that the proper emphasis that
should be placed upon Women’s role
as a homemaker and a career wo-
man be resolved.

It is therefore necessary that

‘Chancellor Litchﬁeld and Dean Rush

sit down together and discuss the
matter and through an exchange of
ideas and problems faced in imple-
menting them come up with a uni-
form policy in the matter of what
should be done in the matter of

Student Government has opened both barrels on what
promises to be a year-long battle for student rights. The
three major proposals at the ﬁrst fall meeting—-one a
bill -opposing Pennsylvania sales tax on school supplies,
another asking for a student discount at The Book Center,
and a third advocating the return to the students of the
$3200 proﬁt from Student Identiﬁcation cards through
additional allocation to their own student organizations———
leave no doubt as to the direction and sound intentions of
this year’s senate.

The bill opposing the sales tax notes that less than
one-third of one per cent of all revenue from the Penn-
sylvania ﬁve per cent sales tax comes from text books

and school supplies. It thus declares that “a paradox
exists, at a time when higher education is being encour-
aged by our society, that not only is the cost of education

too high, but thestate imposes a ﬁve per cent tax upon
the supplies of those very students whom it ‘encourages.”

This bill addressed to the Governor and General As-
sembly of the State of Pennsylvania is a strong one,
backed by a logical rationale and more importantly by a
student body which recognizes the importance of a uni-

position of the party platform
to the performance by Carol

Channing of “Hello, Lyndon,"
President Johnson had a nearly
monarchical control over the pro-
ceedings in Atlantic City.

There were, nevertheless, two
potentially disruptive challenges
to the Johnsonian script: Notably
the contest over the seating of
the Mississippi delegation and
the tumultuous reception given
Robert Kennedy.

THE STRUGGLE in the Cre-
dentials Committee between the
rival delegations from Mississippi
threatened to shatter the Presi-
dent’s hopes for a uniﬁed front.
In the pre-convention hearings
the Freedom Democratic party
stated forcefully and eloquently
the moral ‘case for the seating of
its delegation, while the Missis-
sippi regulars developed an argu-
ment based solely upon the legal
efficiency of their party.

On could see Chairman David
Lawrence, whose unenviable re-
sponsibility it was to preserve the
image of Democratic solidarity
and brotherhood, grimace as Jo-
seph Rauh called witness after
witness to the stand, each of
whom contributed a chapter of
testimony to “the story of moral
agony” so central to Negro life
in Mississippi. A

By Monday the other three
challenges to come before the
committee had been disposed of,
but the Mississippi contest wouid_
not be resolved until Tuesday
afternoon, at which time the com-
mittee would reconvene.

BUT WHILE Senator P.ast_ore
delivered his impassioned key-H”
note address, a meeting was held,
virtually unnoticed and intention-
ally unpublicized, at the Shel-
burne Hotel on Michigan Avenue,
headquarters for the Minnesota-\
delegation (and Hubert Hum-
phrey).

The participants in this strategy
conference had been assigned by
the President the delicate task of
producing a workable compromise
on the Mississippi problem. It was
this meeting at which the fabric
of compromise was woven.

The convention in general and
the Mississippi squable in particu-
lar constitute a case study in the-
political style of President John-
son. It is ironic that Lyndon
Johnson, not his “conservative”
opponent for the Presidency, is
in fact the heir to Edmund
Burke’s maxim that “.311 govem-_
ment . . . is founded on com-
promise.” The Presidént’s Real-
politik stands in marked contrast "

gence and negativism in legisla‘-w

 VERY DAY I HAVE TO CRY
SATURDAY’S GAME with UCLA pointed up several weak-
nesses in the Panther line that will have to be repaired if
 the Panthers want a winning season. UCLA had no trou-
j ble moving through the Panther right side, especially
‘ '-through «glen Linaburg and Bill Howley _
 After the game, Coach Michelosen admitted that
 the tackles’ and ends would be hlS biggest problem in the
next few weeks. Football players cannot be taught ex-
perience, and lack of experience, according to Michelosen,
.is the Panthers’ biggest problem. “They’re inexperi-

 1. enced,” Michelosen said, “so they made mistakes. They

  

  



  

stayed away from it.

  

 ‘-just don’t have the know-how yet.” .

NEXPERIENCE can explain the lack of strong hne play,
it cannot explain dropped passes. ‘Panther receivers
treated the football like a friend with halitosis. They

In the fourth quarter, Bill Howley dropped a pass

I P on the UCLA 14-yard line that would have given the

   

    

  

  

 

Panthers a ﬁrst down. Later in the same quarter, How-

ley dropped another pass thrown by Kenny Lucas that

a would have given the Panthers a ﬁrst down on the UCLA
"40-yard line. In addition to the passes Howley dropped,

.Mitch Zalnasky dropped two passes, Eric Crabtree drop-

, ped -a pass, and Dale Stewart dropped a pass.

“The receivers dropped more passes today than any

 ‘I other game I can remember,” Michelosen said. But the
, game reminds us of the 1962 opener with Miami of

a to the other team.

  

’ Florida. Panther receivers dropped perfect passes from
quarterback Jim Traﬁcant. By the ﬁfth game, the quar-
terback lost conﬁdence in his receivers, and hestitated
to pass. We hope that doesn’t happen this year.

‘THE -"PANTHERS have a‘ much longer way to go for a
_-good season than we thought. Oregon, Miami, Army, Navy,
 and Penn State should all be better teams than UCLA.
And West Virginia always plays their best game against

But Coach Michelosen is still optimistic, and with
good reason. “We can still have a tremendous ball club.
We just made too many mistakes. We gave theball up
ﬁve times. Three times on fumbles and twice on inter-
-ceptions.” You can’t win if you keep handing the ball

;,W'E AGREE with Coach Michelosen that it’s still too early
to panic. The Panthers have an explosive offense, when
' they don’t fumble. They have eight good backs on the
ﬁrst two units. They showed good breakaway speed, and
can score against any team in the country. This team
"will improve with age. So will the opposition.
. UCLA COACH Billy Barns says Fred Mazurek is .a great
-quarterback. “We won’t play against a better pass-run
. . ‘quarterback all year. He’s a wonderful ballplayer. He
. hasgreat speed, he’s_a ﬁne passer, and he’s an excep-
 tional -runner. He is deﬁnitely Pitt’s key man.”
’WE,,WONDER why, with fourth down and inches, and only
1:08 left in the game, Kenny Lucas did -not call two plays in
. the huddle. Not calling two plays cost the Panthers 38
seconds. Not calling two plays cost the Panthers at least
two more plays in the last minutes of the game, and they
 ran out of time on the UCLA 21. ‘

Last  Minute Bid Dies
On Bruin 2 1 -Yard Line

 

By BOB SMIZIK
More than 41,000 persons sat back at 1 p.m. Saturday
at the Stadium to see the Panthers whip UCLA. Some two
hours later, with the Panthers trailing, 17-6, the conﬁdence
of the crowd was still high. Visions of Paul Martha dashing
off tackle for a couple of long scoring runs danced in their

heads.

But Paul Martha does not play
for Pitt this year and neither

‘does Rick Leeson, or Ernie Bor-

ghetti, or Jeff W.are, or Ed Adam-
chik, or John Maczuzak, or Al
Griguliunas, or Joe Kuzneski; so
the Panthers were beaten, 17-12.

There was a trace of last sea-
son’s heroics, but a late drive
ran out of time on the UCLA
23-yard line.

UCLA coach Bill Barnes sum-
med up the Panther problems in
one sentence: “Obviously Pitt
missed some of those ﬁne line-
men,” he said.

John Michelosen put it another
way. He said, “We made a lot
of mistakes. We gave them some
touchdowns they didn’t have to
go too far to get.”

The Panthers’ inexperience was
most evident at end where ﬁve
lettermen were lost from the 1963
team. Bill Howley, Mitch Zal-
nasky and Eric Crabtree all drop-
ped important passes for the
Panthers. Zalnasky once gave the
ball up when he threw away a
lateral to Crabtree after receiv-
ing a pass.

But it was more than a weak
passing game which ruined the
Panthers. Their defense failed to
stop UCLA on the big plays. On
the Bruins ﬁrst touchdown drive
quarterback Larry Zeno com-
pleted a third and eight pass to
the Pitt 16. Another time the

P.anthers had UCLA third and‘

eight near the midﬁeld stripe
when Zeno, who was brilliant all
afternoon, broke through for a
33 yard run to set up a ﬁeld goal
at the close of the ﬁrst half.

Excellent defensive play by
linebacker Marty Schottenheim-
er saved the Panthers from an
even more embarrassing after-
noon. Schottenheimer made a
lasting impression on several pro
scouts in the stands who came to
see him perform.

last year.” Freshman coach Bob

McNulty, who played for the
alumni, conﬁrmed Bemis’ view
saying, “I didn’t hear any argu-
ing among the varsity players
during‘ the game.”

Beyond the high monale
which permeated the team, good
player potential was shown.
George Sommer’s 30 yard goal
from his right halfback posi-
tions shows that the booters
will have an outside offensive
threat. Bemis said, “Now we
will be able to shoot from the
outside as ‘well as the inside,
which will give us the distri-
buted attack we lacked last
year.”

Bemis was pleased with the
play of several sophomores who
he is counting on to give the
team good substitution depth.
Ferd. Sauer played most of the
game at right wing in place of
injured starter Aldo Zortea. Zor-

. pulled a "hamstring" muscle‘ in.

Sal Tavares, another sopho-

' more, alternated with letterman

Jim Meyers at inside right. Ta-
vares scored one of the goals,
and with Meyers and him there
will be good versatility at that
position; Al Trautensteiner and
Jim. Snyder .alternated at center
halfback during the game, and
will provide added depth to start-
ers Andy McGraw and George
Sommer.

Vince Bartolotta, a 6 foot
sophomore from Monongahela,
played the entire game at in-
side left, and seems to have the
best crack at the starting posi-
tion. » '

“The goalie position is still
open,” said Bemis. Although the
two. top prospects, Ken Lang and
Dom Millilo, both played an
equal amount ‘ of time, neither

» was  outstanding; -“They’re both '-
fi ‘-8005? and’  ‘f"’e.°k'S 33”“? ..‘“’.“.1.s

Even Schottenheimer’s strong
play could not stop the Bruins
from marching 63 yards for a
score the ﬁrst time they got the
ball with halfback Steve Durbin
scoring on a seven yard pass from
Zeno. '

Dale Stewart picked up 38

/yards of a 75-yard Panther scor-

ing drive in the second period
which was ended by quarterback
Fred Mazurek’s four yard run, A
Mazurek to Howley pass for the
conversion was intercepted.

UCLA scored a touchdown and
a ﬁeld goal before the half end-
ed to take a 17-6 lead after the
ﬁrst 30 minutes of play.

It stood that way until late in
the third quarter when fullback
Barry McKnight closed .a 38 yard
drive with a two yard plunge.

The Panthers’ ﬁnal effort,
which was highlighted by an out-
standing catch by Stewart, may
have made it with a physically
sound Mazurek. The Panthers’
All-American candidate sat out
much of the ﬁnal quarter after
being shaken up by UCLA line-
men.

Mazurek admitted after‘ the
game he could not remember any-
thing he had called after he was
injured. He was alternating with
Kenny Lucas at the end of the
game. It Was Lucas who led the
Panthers to their second score
while Mazurek sat dazed on the
bench.

Michelosen, whose cries-of lack
of experience had fallen on deaf
ears, had his point proven the
hard way. “We knew they had
the experience on us,” he said,

“but our mistakes still were frus-'

trating. Last year we were catch-
ing those balls. But our boys will
come along.”

There was one point where
Michelosen quarreled with his
players. While the Panthers were
moving for their ill-fated last
minute scoring attempt they ran
into a fourth and one situation
which necessitated McKnight hit-
ting the line, a move which gave
them the ﬁrst down but also used
up a lot of time.

Michelosen admitted his quar-

call two plays in the huddle in
such a situation and said they
should have done so Saturday.

The Panthers’ mistakes tended

from Zeno who rushed for 106
yards and passed for two more
than that while completing 12 of

(See story, page 6.)

The outlook for this year’s soccer team is one of
optimism. According to coach Leo Bemis, “Although we
have a tough schedule, we have twelve returning letter-
men which gives us the potential for a good season.” The
only players lost were Tom Staab, a goalie and co-captain

Bruno Schwartz, .a lineman and co-captain; Gene
Balkovec,’a fullback, and Jay Speecher, a halfback.

The booters have good experienced players at
every position except goalie. Currently the top
prospects are Ken Lang and Dom Millilo, both of
whom are lettermen. Since Staab played.most of
last year, neither Lang nor Millilo have had much

experience at the position.

“Our strongest positions are the fullbacks and i ,
halfbacks where we have excellent depth,” said .1
Bemis. Cal Bonawitz, Jim Cuddy, and "co-captain

    

neiche .. .. -

Andy McGraw all lettered asfullbacks last year and will be the
probable starters. Art Richardson, a sophomore, is also vying for the
position and will probably see some action.

The same situation exists with the halfbacks as with full-
backs. George Sommer, Dave Schaﬁer, and" Gene McGrevin all
lettered as halfbacks and will provide the needed experience.
Another strong contender at halfback is sophomore Jim Snyder,
who earned a numeral on last year’s freshman

team.

One of the things on which the team’s success
will depend will be the switching of George Shim-
pino, a two-year letterman, from outside right to
center-forward. Bemis feels this move ‘‘will give
us more punch and the scoring thrust we lacked

last year.”-

Aldo Zortea, who lettered at center-forward
last year, has switched with Shimpino and will
be playing outside right. Zortea, however, will
have stiff competition from sophomore Ferd Sauer.

   

.

McGraw” A

Co-captain and All-American Dave Reichenbach has the outside

left position secured.

Jim Meyers, a one-year let-

terman is the top prospect at

inside right, while there is
presently no definite starter at
inside left. Last year’s starter,
Sam Donatelli, will not be play-
ing this year, and Vince Barto-
lotta, a sophomore, is the top
contender.

Although Bemis could%,conceiv-

ably start at all-letterman teain,
he says “there is an opportunity
for several sophomores to move
up to starting positions and give

us added depth in the line.”

This year’s Panther cross
country team will face a
stiff schedule of five dual

meets and one triangular
meet. The season started

Saturday with a dual meet
against Slippery Rock State at the
Panther’s home course in Schen-
ley Park.

In _an appraisal of this y_ear’s
team,
“Our two top men should be John
Baily and Damion Koch. Dave
Eichenlaub will be of some help
when he gets into shape.”

When asked about help from
his three promising men from
last year’s frosh squad, Banner
expressed" some optimism. He
mid, “Fran Shor, Larry Huber,
and Frank Handleman will be
valuable help to the squad
when they get into shape.”

season and what chances his team

will have in coming up with a

good season, Banner couldn’t say.
He ‘has only one week to
get his team into shape. The
squad worked" out twice a day
for four days, but this iwas
hardly enough time to work

E out the kinks, he said. Banner

is counting on Baily and Koch
because of past performances
and because they worked to
stay in shape over the summer.
As for the others, Banner has
hopes that Eichenlaub will
come around fast and that
sophs Shot and Handleman can
be strong runners.
