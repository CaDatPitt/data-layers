University closed today
Classes, activities cancelled to help conserve energy

By Stephen Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

Last night, Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor made the decision to close
the university today except for all
essential services.

A blast of arctic air that sent shivers
up spines and killed car batteries
from Kentucky to Maine has caused
an emergency power shortage
that has all but paralyzed Pennsyl-
vania. _

Students
encounter

with buses,
shuttles

By Amy Fink
Staff Writer

Since the university decided
to close the campus yesterday
early in the afternoon, students
have encountered several prob-
lems with the shuttle system.
With everybody trying to leave
the campus at once, it was “too
close for comfort” on the shut-
tles.

According to John Morgan,
assistant director for transporta-
tion, “The main problem was
overcrowding because the
classes let out early, and the stu-
dents were not cooperating.”

Several athletes who waited
in the lobby of the William Pitt
Union had be at their team
practices at certain times and
were unable to rely on the shut-
tles to get them there. They had
to make alternate plans.

Student Keith Metz said, “,It’s
like a herd of cattle out there.”
He waited over half an hour try-
ing to get on a shu_ttle.

Morgan stated that the depart-
ment added several shuttles to
the route, to compensate for the

DeNardo said temperatures are getting
“progressively better,” Lt. Governor
Mark Singel asked city and county offi-
cials, commercial businesses and school
districts to remain closed today to con-
serve energy.

“It is necessary to conserve power in
any way we can,” Singel said. “lThe
Pennsylvania government] has autho-
rized power companies to reduce
power to a need basis.”

Classes were also cancelled on
Wednesday at approximately 1 p.m.
when O’Connor issued a statement that

Bus or bust...

Students wait to get on a campus bus outside the William Pitt Union yesterday in frigid temperatures after classes were
cancelled. Records were set with the bone chilling temperature reaching negative 22 degrees yesterday. A-fter Lt.
Governor Mark Singel declared Pennsylvania a state of emergency, classes were cancelled yesterday afternoon and
today. ' '

the university would comply with the
need to conserve energy.

Some students were angry that the
university had waited that long and
risked the health of the students.

“I think they should have cancelled
classes [Tuesday night],” Pitt junior
Stephanie Halupa said. “It was entirely
too cold to go outside lWednesdayl
morning.”

First-year student Erica Sentz said that
she trekked to her Wednesday morning
classes in two pairs of pants, two pairs
of socks, a sweater, a scarf, a jacket,

gloves, etc. “And I was still cold,” Sentz
said.

“[Classes] should have been cancelled
Wednesday morning," Sentz said.

“I don’t think it was handled very
well.”

While others ventured into the deep
freeze to go to classes, some students,
like first—year student Chad Alexander,
got lucky.

“I didn’t have class until 2 p.m.,
and they cancelled classes at 1 pm. so
I stayed inside all day,” Alexander

overcrowding, making it quick-
er and easier to get a shuttle.

Overcrowding was not the
only immediate problem that
the Department of
Transportation had to attend to.
A water main brake in
Shadyside on Ellsworth Avenue
prevented any travel, and the
department had to change bus
routes.

Poor street conditions, due to
snow and ice, also delayed
shuttles and prevented them
from being on time at their
appropriate stops.

Choice Dollars will buy stu-
dents more than a trip to a self-
service cafeteria line. Now stu-
dents may dine in a more
sophisticated atmosphere with
the White Linen Series located
at the Pitt Club on Thackeray
Avenue.

The dining service at Pitt has
expanded students’ eating
options with its opening this
week. On Mondays and
Wednesdays, (when the uni-

versity is opened) the Pitt Club
will be open from 5 p.m. to 7
p.m. Choice Dollars and Dinner
Cash Equivalency of $5 are
accepted. However, students
should make sure they have
extra cash with them because
the average meal price ranges
from $6.95 to $14.95.

“It’s a nice change, but you
have to be willing to spend
more money,” said sophomore
Danielle Krause.

Some students said they
believe the higher prices for
better food should be compati-

ble with the cafeteria. Junior
Cory Eckert said, “If the [cafete-
ria] dinner Costs $6.95, then
why don’t we get the same
food as the White Linen
Series?”

For now, the choice for stu-
dents to make is where to eat.

“We wanted to offer students
a more upscale and different
dining experience,” said Lori
Armstrong, supervisor for the
White‘Linen Series.

There is no specific dress
code, but because the White
Linen Series is more sophisti-

cated, sweats might look out of
place with the white linen
tablecloths.

“Students are tired of the
same cafeteria food  we offer
a change from the bar attire.
Also, for the price, I think the
portions are a nice size,” head
chef Don Kiser said.

First-year student Tara Niglio
agreed. “I think it is a good
idea because you can use your
meal card in a restaurant-like
atmosphere.”

Come to the Health Fair and
find out!!!

Each year the Student Health
Service sponsors a campus-
wide health fair that hosts over
2,000 participants. The purpose
of the Health Fair is to increase
student awareness of health
related programs and services at
Pitt’s campus and in the sur-
rounding community.

The fair introduces students
to disease prevention and
health promotion concepts and
activities. This is a great oppor-
tunity to check out your own

 

health and discover strategies
for adopting healthier lifestyles

and achieving optimal wellness.

Through the participation of
the many campus and commu-
nity organizations that will be
represented, we hope you will

  

not only gain knowledge about
healthy lifestyles but will have
fun doing it as well.

Each of the health related
organizations is asked to create
upbeat, interactive exhibits that
will stimulate student interest in
disease prevention and health
promotion.

Because the Student Health
Service believes fun and enter-
tainment are health promoting,
this year we are featuring
Beautiful Hands, the Pitt Dance
Ensemble, the Black Dance
Workshop and aerobic demon-
strations.

The Pirate Parrot will also be
mingling around in the crowd.

When checking to see
whether classes are can-
celled or not, what do
you do? Listen to the
entire closings list on the
radio and wait until the
DJ gets to the letter “u”?

No, just call Telefact,
the people who can
answer most of your
questions if you can get
past the busy signal.

Between noon and 2
p.m. Wednesday, Telefact
received over 900 calls
asking about cancella-
tions, according to opera-
tor Kathleen Sweeney.

Wednesday afternoon
the five Telefact operators
answered the phones by
saying, “All classes are
cancelled today and
tonight.” Some callers still
asked whether school
was cancelled or not.

“What part of all can’t
you understand?” opera-
tor Kevin Docherty said.

Because their tele-
phones could not be used
to call out during part of
Wednesday afternoon, all
Telefact could do was
give callers nuiiibeis to
find answers for them-

Junior Ed Leacht said, “I like

no other fine restaurant uses it.
Plus, I think the entrees sound

The sub-zero temperatures
have been some of the coldest
ever recorded in Pittsburgh.

The all-time low in Pittsburgh
of minus 22 degrees was
set at 6:45 a.m. on Wednes-
day.

The previous low was
minus 20 degrees on Feb. 10,
1899.

Temperatures are expected
to rise today into the teens and
will be accompanied by flurries
for most of the day.

WTAE reported that state

officials are asking that
residents postpone using
their dishwashers and washing
their clothes.

State officials also requested
that residents keep their ther-
mostats set in the low— to mid-
60 degree range.

Singel said that several hours
after the first call for conserving
energy was made yesterday
afternoon, a sizeable difference
could be seen in the decreased
usage of power.

Singel also said that all state
and federal government offices
will be closed today.

It’s not the cold, it's the wind chill

Oh the weather outside is frightful 

At 6:45 a.m. yesterday morning, Oakland experienced
a temperature of minus 22 degrees, the lowest ever
recorded in Pittsburgh.

At 8 a.m. yesterday morning students went to class at
the University of Pittsburgh.

The temperature did not shoot up to make their walk
any easier. Even though the sun was glaring in their
eyes, it didn’t help to melt the ice that made the walk
rather slick.

Although the night before local news broadcasts
warned of the dangers of venturing out in the cold.
Today many students did not have running water, not
to mention that they were freezing and risking frost-
bite, Pitt did not cancel classes yesterday.

At least not until until 1:10 p.m.

It’s a shame that technology hasn’t provided us with
the means of knowing beforehand what weather con-
ditions might be. Then they could broadcast the infor-
mation on the television and radio, and classes could
have been cancelled earlier.

“In light of the extreme weather conditions and the
request that we take steps to preserve regional power
supplies, classes and programs at the University of
Pittsburgh are cancelled for the remainder of the day,”
said Pitt Cancellorj. Dennis O’Connor.

Perhaps O’Connor didn’t want to exercize his power
to close the school because he was conserving it.

This is not the first time Pitt students have risked
their safety to attend classes. The university did not
cancel classes on the first day of classes after Christmas
break even -though students from outlying areas and
especially those coming from out of state had a treach-
erous trip back to Oakland. When the temperatures
cause frostbite in a matter of minutes, Pitt should not
hesitate to cancel classes, especially when there are
students who have to ‘trek across campus for classes.

When the weather is as severe as it has been the past
few. days, the number of people who miss classes often
makes professors reluctant to move ahead. As a result,
classes are disrupted. Worse yet is the case of the stu-
dents who have ventured out in the weather only to
find their professors couldn’t make the trip to campus.

England’s universities once canceled classes for a
term because of the plague. While on this hiatus, Isaac
Newton made one of the greatest leaps in scientific
thought in history. He developed calculus. While the
students studying this mathematical stroke of genius
may groan at this example, the administration should
consider how committed they are to the advancement
of knowledge. Closing for bad weather shows intelli-
gence and consideration for faculty, staff and students.
We are relieved that Pitt’s administrators decided to
cancel today’s classes last night. We only wish they had
been as reasonable yesterday morning. '

Elders Wrong on strategy for drug War

Several weeks ago at the
National Press Club, Surgeon
General Joycelyn Elders said
that. the U.S. should consider
legalizing the sale and use of
drugs. Elders supported her

argument by saying that ‘‘we ,

would markedly reduce our
crime rate if drugs were legal-
ized.I feel that we need to do
some studies.” Elders’ remarks
came within days of President
Clinton's meeting with many of

the nation’s top mayors who

are calling for more money to
fight the war on drugs. Once
again Clinton was blindsided
from the Left by one of his
controversial and incompetent
appointees. Within hours of
Elders’ statements, the White
House released a statement of
its own which said that the
president would not consider
legalizing drugs. The issue,
however, is not so easily for-
gotten.

It seems to me that there is
much more to this debate than
that which was put forth by
Elders. I have yet to hear the
liberals question what effects
the legalization of drugs would
have on the nation’s children.

For the past decade we have,

been teaching our children in
the schools to “just say no” to
drugs. What do we tell them if
drugs are suddenly (and stupid-
ly) legalized? It would be the
ultimate betrayal to our chil-
dren and our nation if we
make drugs as readily available

I am glad to be graduating on May 2. I proba-
bly would go insane if I had to spend one more
term in this “politically correct” cesspool. The
straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back in
this case is the Lambda Chi poster. This school is
very close to picking up where Vladimir Lenin
left off. The CWO likes to tout choice. That ‘is, a
WOMAN’S right to choose. A fraternity posts a
woman in a bikini as a part of a rush. So what?
Is this violating the morals of society as a whole?
No. How is this THREATENING? It is not as if
she is being beaten by three Lambda Chi broth-
ers. She is posing for this poster out of her own
compensated for posing.
WHAT THE IS WRONG WITH THAT? I thought I

free will. She was

as alcohol is now. Loss of pro-
ductivity in the workplace and
deaths on the highways would
increase drastically if people
could buy drugs without the
fear of punishment, not to
mention the increase in AIDS
through intravenous drug use.
Moreover, the legalization of
drugs would take away the
social stigma that now accom-
panies its inherent evilness.

Tony .
Dickensheets

This is yet another attempt by
liberals to downplay deviance
and lower the values which this
nation was founded on. The
people who support legalized
drugs say that they do so
because it would lead to a
lower crime rate and fewer
murders. This is unproven and
highly disputable logic. While it
is true that approximately 60
percent of all crime is drug
related, the legalizing of drugs
would give many more people
the access to them, and more
people on drugs can only
increase the crime rate, not
lower it. Once something is
legalized, consumption is
NEVER decreased. Instead,
consumption is invariably
increased. That is something
that an America on the brink of

Pitt’

losing its civility doesn’t need.
If America really wants to
win the war on drugs we need
to ‘take a two-pronged
approach. First of all, we must
educate the young in the hopes
that we can steer them away
from drugs. If they are in fami-
lies where drug use is happen-
ing, we need to take them out
of that situation. Drug addicts
shouldn’t have the right to raise
children. Secondly, we need to
put more police on the streets,
particularly in those neighbor-

. hoods that are currently being
- controlled by drug dealers. Itis

an indisputable fact that the
larger the show of force, ‘the
less chance there is for crime to
occur. Finally, we MUST pass
laws which require stricter
mandatory sentences for drug
dealers and a mandatory death
penalty for repeat offenders
and for the major drug distribu-
tors and suppliers.

Whether the U.S. wins the
war on drugs is largely depen-
dent on if we are willing to
spend the money to educate
our children in addition to
eliminating the criminals that
prey on them. Running away
from the problem by legalizing
drugs is not a solution; it is a
recipe for a future disaster
greater than the one this coun-
try already faces, along with
the further fraying of the social
fabric of America.

Photographers look out

We thought it was a little too cold to be tak-
ing pictures today, so we sat down at the trusty com-
puter to share with you our thoughts on some of the
issues that have been on our minds this week.

Earthquake or bitterly cold’ The age old
debate heated up (in a matter of speaking) this week
as the Los Angeles area was hit with a major earth- A
quake and the northeast was hit with the coldest arctic
air we’ve seen in.ften—years. Where’s the Greenhouse
Effect now boys? , _

The question remains: would you rather be
tossed from your bed at 4 o’clock in the morning or
walk to class in sub zero temps. While LA is a great
place to be, the photogs both agree that we’ll take this
kind of weather any day. One defining factor is that
Joe said it would be cold, but when it comes to earth-
quakes Joe don’t know. The bottom line is you can
wear layers to keep the cold out but there’s little you ‘
can do to protect your self from a 6.6 wake-up call.

This cold weather will soon be forgotten
come the summertime but the threat of earthquakes is
always a concern of the residents of Southern
California. The effects of this weeks earthquake will
be around for years to come as several freeways in the
LA area will take months to re-build, but the icy side- _
walks are sure to melt with a dose of salt and sun.

A Court TV dream come true has been played
out in a Manassas, Virginia courtroom this week as the

Lorena Bobbitt trial continued. As Mrs. Bobbitt testified
as to how her abusive husband repeatedly raped her
several times, the free flow of tears is sure to have an
affect on the jury.

While the verdict is not yet in, may we go on
record as saying it will be a crying shame if this
woman is not convicted and put into jail. She is a
lying, cheating thief who attempted to take her hus-
band’s manhood. A woman like this has no place in a
civilized society. We applaud John Bobbitt for attempt-

ing to keep his dignity throughout these difficult times.
If she had any class, Tonya Harding would
step down from the Olympic team. But it appears as
though it is going to take a forced removal by United
States Olympic officials to get her off the team. The
arrest of her ex—husband raises further speculation that
Ms. Harding had no idea of the attack on her biggest
rival. Already two of the men arrested for plotting the
attack have implicated her, yet she continues to deny
any wrong—doing. An athlete with any ties at all to this
sort of behavior should not be representing our coun-

try in the Olympics.
Micheal Jackson should send Tonya a note

' thanking her for taking the media spotlight off of him

for a few weeks.

This week has been dominated by huge front
page stories about death, destruction, and trials.
Thumbs up this week go to the men and women out
in LA that put their lives on the line to rescue others.
Thumbs down go to all the knucklheads who took
advantage of the earthquake by thinking the broken
store front windows were an invitation to do a little
unauthorized shopping.

Thumbs up go to the defense team of Erik
Menendez for getting half of the jury to believe his
fantasy of a story. Thumbs down go to the DA’s office
who says they will prosecute him again. Let the boy
take his $14 million and save the California tax payer
some much needed money.

Our sympathy goes out to folks on both the
east and west coast as they continue to deal with what
mother nature hands out. Traffic problems will turn LA
into a gridlock nightmare, and icy roads will presum-
ably be a problem for the rest of the winter.

With a little patience everyone will get
through the problems this past week has brought
about, and remember only 60 days of winter left.

Interracial relationships a Way for people to understand one another

Three summers ago Carol, an
engineering student at a mid-
western university, joined a dis-

‘ cussion group that I had been a

part of for about two years. She
was in Pittsburgh for an intern-
ship with Westinghouse. She
was lonely in a strange city and
had recently lost a grandfather,
so she was looking for a friend.
She chose me.

As it turned out, we had a lot

in con1mon._ We had mutual
interests in theology and‘ cul-

ture, plus we were able early
on to share" our deepest feel-
ings and needs without feeling
exploited. We’ve kept in touch
ever since, even though we
didn’t see each other for two-
and-a-half years and have
dated other people in that time.

Last Valentine’s weekend,
she drove all the way from
Chicago, where she lives now,
just to see me. She lets me
know when she’s in Pittsburgh
on business so that we can
hook up. I’ve been to Chicago
recently to ring in the new
year. We hold hands in public
and cuddle in private. She is a
neat person who has become a
special friend. Yet there are
people who say that our rela-
tionship is illegitimat or even
morally wrong.

I’m black. Carol is white.

If you want to find the real
reason that racism-is still a
major problem in our society,

Conservatives must leeep from being

look no further. With all the
talk about “sensitivity” and
“diversity” that’s been thrown
about over the past few years,
very few people are willing to
ignore racial lines in cultivating
relationships. It seems society
even wants to remain ignorant

so that the war that race rela— -

tions has become can continue
—-— sick, isn’t it?

While I didn’t see Spike Lee’s
movie “_Iu'ngle“Fever,” I have

 heard» that--it — tried -to -promjote

the stereotype that interracial
relationships ‘are based solely
onlust. The storyline centered
aro'und"a_n affair between a
married black man and his
Italian—American secretary. I
remember the old stereotypes
about black men, that we are
all sex machines who lust after
white women. The truth be
told, “jungle fever” is a myth
perpetrated by a racist ideology

Part of the problem is people
from different races and cul-
tures are expected to lead dif-
ferent lifestyles in order to
“keep the heritage.” I don’t
think there’s anything wrong
with promoting one’s culture,
but when having relationships
outside of it is disallowed, I
think that the meaning of the
culture gets lost because peo-

ple become less than human._

That’s where it leads to racism,
which I define as an attitude of
“us—and-them” —— which ulti-

mately leads to “us—against-
them.” Instead of having seri-
ous dialogue that fosters under-
standing, what actually hap-
pens is that both sides attack
each other for not “seeing the
other side.”

Interracial relationships are
especially frightening because
the very existence of them
forces racist people to question
their own thinking, and they
don’t want to do that} How did
you react" 9 the last ‘time you saw
an interracial couple together?

  Rick
Nowlin

I learned early in life about
the ramifications of interracial
relating. I attended a number of
private, predominantly white
schools growing up, and as I
was usually the only black
male in my class, I had to learn
how to deal with whites. I did
remarkably well, too. As an
eighth-grader, I graduated sec-
ond in my class, won a major
award and was elected home-
room president. I found I was
the only black who was
involved in school activitie. At
the time I didn’t care.

To complicate things further,
I always had considerable con-
tact with white girls, some of

which they initiated. Just two
weeks after entering the fifth
grade, I was set upon by a
blonde first-grader who rode
the same bus home as I did
and in the process developed
an annoyingly massive crush
on me. She used to kiss me,
hold me and on one occasion
she played with my hair. She
wasn’t the only white girl who
was fond ofme. Among my

A other admirers‘ werea ‘popular 9

blonde classmate, the "two
youngest sisters of another
classmate and a girl that I met
at church camp,

The black girls I knew either
ignored or harassed me, and

A while I’ll never know for sure,

I’ve always suspected this had
to do with my affinity for white
society in general and white
girls in particular. That was fine
with me, as I wanted nothing
to do with them —— not because
they were black but because of
howthey treated me.

That was 20 years ago, I’ve
seen absolutely no change in
attitude since then, and to this
day, I have never dated a black
woman. I have absolutely no
sympathy for black women
who complain that black men
are going after white women.
As a black female co-worker
once told me, the whiners tend
to drive men away as it is.

That’s the other reason why
“jungle fever” is a myth. '

Despite the attention that black
men dating white women get,
the truth is that, despite (or
perhaps in reaction to) the
European cultural standard _of
beauty, over 95 percent of
black men say they prefer
black women. Only two per-
cent of marriages nationwide
are interracial. We should
understand that a black man
who is good-looking, intelligent
and seems to have something

“going for him will be attractive

-to women, even white women.

I have to be honest in saying
that being black does have an
impact on how I see the world,
and I think Ilwould be a differ-
ent person altogether if I
belonged to another race. But,
I accept myself as I am, and
'I’m able to accept other people
as they are without trying to
force or manipulate them into
my mold. That’s the key to hav-
ing a healthy relationship with
anyone, no matter what race .

I don’t know if Carol and I
have a future together.
However, if we do, we (and
not social pressure to conform)
will determine that in its time.
We really do enjoy each other’s
company, and if you have a
problem with that, you have a
problem.

”BI/t1’}’t-R7/tS/98 ” by self-named voices

Welcome to the liberal voice of the
University of Pittsburgh. I know many
have been eagerly waiting for this col-
umn to appear, and its time has come.

I, take this opportunity to discuss my
opinions on Rush Limbaugh, the most
inﬂuential (in his own mind) voice of
the conservative cry-baby class of 1994,
and “shed the light of truth” on the self-
made individual that he has become.

Simply put, the man is the late 20th
century version of P.T. Barnum. He
shows his listeners a lot of smoke and
“talent on loan from God,” but does not
offer any solutions. If the man really
had God-given talent to see and pass on
the truth, I would think that Godwould
not leave him grasping for the answers!

  

  

not have the answers, but he refuses to
have any kind of intelligent debate on
the issues. One would think that if he is
so correct, he would be eager to prove
his theories. Rush has never invited any-
one from the
C 1 i n t o n
Administration
or even that
mouse Micheal
Kinsley to debate him, either on his
show or at a neutral site.

My main beef with Rush is his self-
righteous attitude. If he is so right about
everything then why does he not have
any experience in public office or even
in an advising role to the last two con-
servative presidents? I listen to conserv-

because they have political experience.
Rush Limbaugh is unqualified to be the
voice of conservatism, and it has
amazed me that the Republican
N a t i o n a l
C o m m i t t e e
hasn’t told him
to stand down
and let their
candidates for public office be the con-
servative voices of the country.

Finally, the idea of Rush Limbaugh
running for the presidency is simply
ludicrous. Ex—President Richard Nixon,
Senator Ted Kennedy and Ross Perot
have a better chance of winning than
Rush. The men I have mentioned above

possess, a political personality and a-

track record of self-made success. Nixon
and Kennedy have won political cam-
paigns, Perot has built two multi-million
dollar companies and has advised presi-
dents. Rush has none of these attributes
and would finish last in a three-person
field consisting of him, Senator Dole
and Jack Kemp.

Here is something to consider’ for
1996: only two percent of Rush’s listen-
ers stated that the reason why they lis-
ten to him was an implied measure of
trust! Never forget that little “Rusty”
Limbaugh is all about entertainment,
and that and a quarter will buy you a

gm rs 5/oirze in 
NFL 1: firzozl

By Brady Slater and
Sean Duncan
The Pitt News

The stars will be out this weekend in the
NFL: Emmitt Smith, Troy Aikman, Neil Smith,
Bruce Smith, Marcus Allen, Jerry Rice, Steve
Young, Thurman Thomas, Michael Irvin,
Ricky Watters, Jim Kelly and of course one of
the brightest novas in NFL history, Joe
Montana.

It’s no surprise that with talent like this the
Cowboys, 49ers, Bills and Chiefs are the best
teams in the NFL. And each of these teams
carries with it a special story.

Can Kelly and the Bills get back to a fourth
consecutive Super Bowl? ,

Can Montana use his playoff experience to
carry the Chiefs to a long- awaited Super Bowl
berth? Will the Cowboys earn the chance to
repeat?

Can Steve Young win the big one? It’s our
job to look at this star—studded atmosphere
and see who will be left after these teams col-
lide.

In other words, these are The Pitt News’
analyses and predictions for this weekend's
playoffs. Lets start with the AFC.

Kansas City Chiefs at Buffalo Bills

All eyes watching this game will be on
Montana and the Chiefs’ offense. Against
Houston last weekend, Montana proved
against Buddy I{yan’s 46 that he is the master
of reading defenses. He threw three fourth-

quarter touchdown passes against an Oilers’ as

scheme that had been murder on offenses for
the previous eleven games. Montana will have
no trouble finding Willie Davis, Keith Cash,
and J.J. Birden against a Bills’ defense that is

North Hills ' Kasperowicz latest of Pittfootball ’s

\\   \

Local talent joins 16 others to commit to Majors program

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

The No. 1 high school football player in
Pennsylvania last year, Eric Kasperowicz, commit-
ted to Pitt on Tuesday.

Kasperowicz, a 6—foot—1-inch, 200 pound quarter-
back from North Hills High School, was voted the
Associated Press Pennsylvania Player of the Year
after leading North Hills (15-0) to WPLAL and state
championships in Quad A last year.

Kasperowicz chose Pitt over Georgia Tech,
Michigan State, North Carolina St. and North
Carolina. He said that Pitt is where he wanted to go
all along.

“I feel I have a pretty good opportunity to play
early and play for a great group of coaches,"
Kasperowicz said.

“Because it was close to home was a factor and
their [assistant] coaches Ken Karcher and Matt
Cavanaugh, who was in the NFL for 14 years [was
another]. They have real high enthusiasm, and I
just want to be a part of that."

Kasperowicz, a four—year starter at North Hills,
led a storybook comeback against Central Bucks
West in the state finals by throwing a 25-yard
touchdown pass with less than two minutes
remaining in the game. Kasperowicz then ran in
the ensuing two-point conversion that put North
Hills on top 15-14.

“That was the greatest feeling of my life,”
Kasperowicz said.

“It was an indescribable feeling. I just wanted to
stay out on the field all 

Kasperowicz’s career high school numbers were
5,550 yards passing and 1,369 yards rushing. He

likes his chances to play next year.

“I have as good a shot as anyone coming in,”
Kasperowic'/. said.

“[Pitt quarterback] John Ryan is the starter and
there are three of us coming in. All you can ask
for is a chance to start, and that’s what I’m looking
forward to in the fall.”

In all, Pitt has commitments from 17 recruits
including three junior college players. It is no
secret which side of the ball needs the most
improvement for the Panthers.

Pitt averaged only 14 points per game last year,
and head coach Johnny Majors has targeted that
area by landing 11 offensive players to help put
some points on the scoreboard.

In November, Majors stressed the need to sign
local recruits saying, “I need to win in my own
backyard." The Panthers have landed seven
Pennsylvania players, three of whom are from the
\VPlAL.

In addition to Kasperowicz, Pitt has commit-
ments from All—\VPIA"L running back Chris
Schneider (6-1, 240) from Penn—Trafford High
School and offensive lineman Jason Dugger (6-4,
255) from Wilmington H.S.

The remaining Pennsylvanian Pitt recruits are
quarterback Matt Lytle (6-4, 210) from
'\X/yomissing, Pa. who chose the Panthers despite
West Virginia coach Don Nehlen’s urging to the
contrary; defensive lineman C.J. Leeds (6-4, 245)
from Cheltenham, Pa.; tight end/linebacker John
Jones (6-4, 220) from Glen Mills, Pa. and lineman
Brock Holland (6-5, 273) from Bangor H.S. Pitt
was the only Division I school to offer Holland a
scholarship.

A year ’s passing makes huge dzff'erence for Pitt Hockey

Flash forward  after last year's formality, this year's Pitt/PSU-West match-up more heavily anticipated

By Tom Schneider
Staff” Writer

Oh what a difference a year
makes.

Last season, the Pitt Hockey
Club —— firmly entrenched in
sixth place in the WPCHA and
long since eliminated from the
playoffs —— had little to play for
in their final game of the season
against Penn State-West.

That game, which closed out
the 1992-95 season for both
clubs, offered the dead—in-the-
water Panthers little more than a
chance for a final hurrah to
close out a dreadful campaign.

The contest held much more
importance to the playoff-
bound Saints, however.

With a victory over the
Panthers, Penn State-West could
have finished the regular season
in third place ahead of Carnegie
Mellon, and in a much better

position heading into the post-
season.

The Panthers, however,
played the role of spoiler with a
9-7 victory, sending the Saints
into the WPCI-IA playoffs with a
big frown and an even bigger
fourth—place finish.

The Saints wound up losing
to first—place WVU in the first
round of the playoffs, while
third-place CMU defeated sec-
ond-place Indiana Universtiy of
Pa. and advanced to the cham-
pionship game.

Flash foiward 

The 1993-94 Panthers —
stronger, more determined and
with perhaps the deepest talent
pool in the league — are one of
the \X/PCHA’s hottest teams.
Though they currently stand in
fourth place with a league

record of 2-3, the addition of
some new talent over the break
should guide them to a strong
finish

Indeed the Panthers are one
of the most improved teams in
the league.

But, if there is any team that
has improved as much as or
more than Pitt, it is Penn State-
West.

This year’s Saints team is
stronger, more disciplined and
ultimately much more success-
ful than they were in ‘92-’93.
Though they have not proven to
be quite as talented as some ‘of
the other teams in the league,
they are certainly a much more
experienced crew and have
used their savvy to coast to a 5-
1 record so far this season. Their
4-5 victory over WVU last week

ing point in Pitt’s rollercoaster
season, and since then, they
have rolled off a 2-0-1 record,
with wins of 12-2 over.Lock
Haven and 8-4 over division-
rival IUP.

Now, the Panthers are look-
ing to show that they are a force
in the league with a victory over
the \Y/PCHA’s top team.

For the Panthers to defeat
PSW and pull even in the divi-
sion, they will need a big contri-
bution from their number-one
scoring line of center Bill Elliott
and wingers Brad Rizzo and

vaulted them into first place in
Division I.

In their first meeting — one
the Panthers would very much
like to forget —— the Saints came
back from two separate one-
goal deficits with five power
play goals to defeat the visiting
Panthers, 9-7.

In that game, the bench in the
visitor’s penalty box was kept
toasty and warm, as penalty
after penalty kept the Panthers
shorthanded for much of the
third period, allowing the
inevitable comeback.

That appeared to be the turn-

Matt White.

Elliott, with 35 points (19
goals, 16 assists) in 10 games,
leads the Panthers in scoring
with a 3.5 points per game aver-
age.

White, a freight train on
skates, works the offensive cor-
ner boards to perfection, and
has helped set up nearly half of
linemate Elliott’s goals while
scoring six himself. Rizzo, a
teammate of Whites at
Allderdice High School and a
new addition to the Panther
team, has excellent puckhan~
dling skills and a deft scoring
tough, which he has used to
score two goals and two assists
in his first two games.

On defense, the breakaway
speed and scoring of Tony
Trovato and the excellent play-
making abilities and defensive
awareness of Scott Giordano
make for one of the best one-
two punches in the league.

The Panthers ventured to
Florida (the land of speed) in
search of some of that much-
needed quality and came home
with three wide receivers.
Teammates Vital Joseph (6-3,
200) and Terrell Dantzler (6-1,
175) from Miami H.S. commit-
ted on the same day as a pack-
age deal. The duo spurned
Florida St. and Miami in the
process. ’

The Early
Years of

Pitt also got an oral commit-
ment from wide receiver Dante
Bryant (6-0, 185) from Largo,
Fla.

Bryant was a third-team all-
state selection, and chose Pitt
over Boston College, Rutgers
and Temple.

Majors went to California to
sign a couple of junior college
players, one of whom is already
enrolled at Pitt. -

Quarterback Sean Fitzgerald

NFL

Continued from page 8
nowhere near as good as the
Oilers was. And if the Chiefs’
passing game is on then
there will be plenty of run-
ning lanes for Allen. Allen
shines in the playoffs and
last week’s pretty touchdown
run was just a preview of
what he’s capable of. The
plain fact is the Chiefs are
going to score some points.

The pressure is going to be
on the Bills’ no-huddle
offense to keep up with
Montana and company. And
they’re going to have to con-
tend with a rejuvenated
Chiefs’ defense that sacked
Warren Moon seven times
last week.If Thomas is able
to run the ball, it will open
up Kelly’s passing attack and
the Bills might have a
chance. But if Thomas is
stuffed, Neil Smith and
Derrick,Thomas will put
Kelly on his back for most of
the afternoon.

You probably think we’re
going with the Chiefs here
and we are. But a note of
caution: If Bruce Smith can
get to Montana enough and
hurt him, the Bills win.

Chiefs-27, Bills-21

Now the NFC.

San Francisco 49ers at
Dallas Cowboys.

Everyone talks about how
important Emmitt Smith is to
the Cowboys, and they are
right. But the fact is, the
adrenaline from the fairy tale
regular-season finale against
the Giants is gone and the
pain in his shoulder is very
real. He’s playing gimpy. But
on the other side of the ball

. isone of the cockiest players

in football coming off the
best game of his career.

Watters is going to ride his
ﬁve-touchdown performance
against the Giants last week
right through Ken Norton
and the Cowboys’ defense.
And with Watters’ wearing
down the Cowboys’ D,
expect to see bombs-away
from Young to Rice and John
Taylor.

With the 49ers’ offense
clicking and a valiant-but-
hurt Emmitt Smith, look for
Aikman to put the ball in the
air about 40 times. Irvin,
Alvin Harper, Jay Novacek,
and Darryl Johnston will
catch a lot of balls as the
Cowboys try to keep up with
the 49ers. And it’s something
they should be able to do
against a suspect 49ers’
defense.

It’s going to be an ole-
fashioned shootout in
Cowboy country. But this
time forget about the past,
because in the end the gold-
miners will have a little too
much for the outgunned
Cowboys to contend with.

49ers-34, Cowboys-31

So after this weekend’s
showcase of the NFL’s
brightest is over, it’ll leave
the classic match—up for
Super Bowl XXVIII that
everyone has been waiting
for. Joe Montana goes for
one for his thumb against the
team his shadow still
enshrouds.

It’s the matchup everyone
has been waiting for. 49ers
Vs. Chiefs.

Mentor vs. apprentice.

A chance for Young to
finally establish his name
among the all-time greats,
and a chance for an all-time
great to become an immor-
tal.

University of Mississippi at

Pitt received a commitment
from another defensive back,
E.C. Varoutsos, from Montreal,
Canada.

Varoutsos, who is also cur-
rently attending classes at Pitt,

runs the 40-yard dash in 4.4
seconds. Varoutsos was rated
as one of the top three players
in Canada and chose Pitt over
a pair of Big Ten schools —
Illinois and Iowa — and
Syracuse.

The Panthers’ four remaining
recruits are all linemen. Two of

the four are from Ohio.
Andrew Grischow (6-3, 260)
from Warren Harding H.S.
chose Pitt over West Virginia
and Virginia. Fady Chamoun
(6-4, 265) from Canfield, Ohio
also chose Pitt over the
University of Virginia.

Pitt also got a commitment

from Jeff Traversy (6-6, 265), a
junior college player from
Arizona Western College in
Yuma, Ariz.

Traversy is considered an
impact player on the defensive
line. He had eight sacks last
year and chose Pitt over the
University of Texas, Texas

Tech and Syracuse.

Pitt’s last recruit, Mike
Schultz (6-7, 290) from Bethel
High in Hampton, Virginia,
was a second-team all-region
selection in Virginia. Schultz
can play on both sides of the
line and chose Pitt over
Virginia and Virginia Tech.
