University Under Evaluation

by MARY ANN MARKO
Assistant News Editor

“Response of the University to
Change” is the focus of an evalua-
tion of the University by the Mid-
dle States Association of Colleges
and Secondary Schools, according
to Mrs. Hilda Jones, director of
Institutional Research and Plan-
ning Studies and chairman of the
Steering Committee for the eval-
uation.

_The first phase of the evalua-
tlon, an institutional self-study,
was completed recently.

The second phase, to begin Feb.
28, consists of an evaluation of
the University based on the self-
study by a team of the Middle
States Association.

“The University is being eval-
uated in a different way,” explain-
ed Jones. “The self-study usually
involves an in-depth look at the
schools of the University, the
characteristics of the student
body, the faculty, the physical
plant, and so. This type of evalua-
tion is being done at the regional
campuses but not here.”

The se1f—examination, conduct-
ed by subcommittees appointed
by Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
and coordinated by the Steering
Committee, began last January.

The three categories studied
were “changes which have alter-
ed the way the traditional student
body is served and the Universi-

ty’s internal responses as to min-
ority groups, curricular systems,
and international education and
relationships; changes which have
involved the University’s serv-

ices to the broader community of -

which it is a part, and the Univer-
sity’s external responses as to
community requirements for ed-

ucational services and commun-
ity requirements for other serv-
ices, and changes in University
governance and administration
which affect the University’s in-
ternal and external responses, in-
cluding demands for changes in

University governance and in-
creasing pressures to control
costs.

The subcommittees, including
governance, faculty teaching pro-
ductivity, international pro-
grams, curricular change, public
service, continuing education,
programs for minority group stu-
dents, and regional campuses,
have completed their study and
prepared reports.

The reports have been present- »
ed to the evaluation team who    K 

will have four weeks to study
them.

According to Jones, the evalua-
tion team will arrive here on Feb.
28 and remain until March 3.
“They will talk to faculty, stu-
dents and administrators at ran-
dom, ” she remarked.

“At the end of all that,” Jones
said, “we hope we’re reacredited.

“The decision concerning re-
affirmation of accreditation
should be made shortly after the
visiting team’s evaluation,” she
added. “The indication will be
very strong in their report.”

The same procedure will be fol-
lowed at the University’s four re-
gional campuses.

The University has been ac-
credited byvthe Middle States As-
sociation since 1921. Approxi-
mately every ten years it is eval-
uated for reaccreditation.

Freeman Calls Pitt City’s 'Asset’

by BILLGORMLEY
News Editor

Executive Assistant Chancellor 1

Jack Freeman termed the Univer-

sity an economic “asset” to Pitts- --

burgh and “a major instrument of
social mobility” in a speech be-
fore Business School alumni Mon-
day.

“While Pitt serves its students
and the Commonwealth by fulfill-
ing its principal mission of teach-
ing, research and public service,”
Freeman said, “it also serves the
economy of this community in a
variety’ of direct and tangible
ways.”

Quoting a study by Dr. Richard
Wynn of the School of Education,
Freeman argued that “the cost of

education must be viewed . . . as a I

high yield investment.”

He also offered evidence of the
University’s role in promoting so-
cial mobility: “Since Pitt became
a state-related university in 1965,
the number of entering students
whose fathers had no college ed-
ucation whatsoever has risen
from approximately 55 per cent
to more than 63.5 per cent and the
percentage of students with an-
nual family incomes below $10,-
000 has risen from 41 per cent to
53 per cent.”

Emphasizing that the Universi-
ty “constitutes a principal force
in the economic and industrial
growth of Western Pennsylvania,”
Freeman summed up the services
it provides.

RESEARCH BOOSTER

“Pittsburgh is the hub for one
of the largest research and devel-

opment complexes in the nation,”
he noted, adding that many local
scientists have been educated
here.

Freeman also observed that 52
per cent of Allegheny County’s
physicians are graduates of the
University’s Medical School.
Ninety-five per cent of local,
dentists, he said, are graduates of

O the University’s Dental School.

Listing the University’s com-
munity health programs and fa-
cilities, Freeman told the busi-
nessmen that 1,600 community
residents are treated daily in the
University Health Center.

“The University also staffs
community health facilities and
clinics, such as Terrace Village,
providing needed health care to
many families in economically
deprived neighborhoods,” be de-
clared. -

20 CORPORATE HEADS

According to Freeman, the Uni-
versity continues to pump num-
erous graduates into jobs with
Pittsburgh corporations. He men-
tioned graduates of the School of
Business and the School of Engi-
neering in particular, and added
that “the board chairmen or
presidents of 20 leading corpora-
tions in the area are graduates
of the University of Pittsburgh.”

The public school system in
Western Pennsylvania also prof-
its from the University, Freeman
said. “Eighty per cent of all school
administrators in Allegheny Coun-
ty have at least one earned de-
gree from the University of
Pittsburgh,” he stated. “And

more than one-third of all Alle-
gheny County teachers hold at
least one degree from the Univer-
sity.” .
Because of the tax revenue it
generates, the University also
benefits indirectly city and coun-
ty government. “In 1969,” Free-
man pointed out, “the wages and
salaries paid to the University’s
employees were $63 million.”

Local businesses also profit
from the spending of University
employees, "as well as students.

* Plans ‘Social Events

by MICHAEL SIMON
To create campus activism among Pitt commuters, the Commuter
Association (CA) is sponsoring a mixer starring the rock group Virgin
Friday in the SU Ballroom from 8 p.m. to 12 midnight. There is anom-

inal admission fee.

Tom Gainan, president of CA, explained the reasoning behind the 1

dance. “Our purpose is to have some sort of social activities on campus
for commuters,” he said. “Perhaps this is the way to get commuters

to stay on campus.

The CA social program is still considered “experimental.” Gain-
an added that if the mixer proves successful, “The CA will continue
to sponsor and ideally co-sponsor social events on campus with organ-
izations such as the Student Association (SA), formerly Student Gov-
ernment and the Student Union Board.

Gainan explaned that co-sponsorship was needed because his or-
ganization could receive only limited funds from the Allocations Com-
mittee and that a joint effort could result in more activities over a
broad scope at a lower cost per organization.

Scheduled by CA for Feb. 16 are five continuously running
films from 12 noon to 4 in the afternoon in the SU Ballroom. There is no

admission charge.

2-S Endangered

Nixon Asks Draft
Extension Until ’73

by BOB BONN
Assistant News Editor

Although the present draft law
expires on June 30, a new propos-
al by President Richard Nixon
asks‘that it be extended until mid-
1973.

In a message presented to the
Senate Subcommittee on the Draft
yesterday, the President called
for the abolition of undergraduate
deferments and a 50 per cent pay
raise for military personnel.

Congressman Edward Hebert,
head of the House Armed Services
Committee, was pleased with the
proposal. “I’m glad to see that
the President has finally come
around to my way of thinking,” he
said.

Other points in the proposal in-
clude a greater emphasis on re-
cruiting and ROTC, a uniform na-
tional call in the lottery system
and a provision for adjustments
in military pay should civilian
rates change significantly.

An alternate bill, co-sponsor-
ed by Senators Barry Goldwater
and Mark Hatfield, has been re-
submitted from the last Congress.
According to a Goldwater aide,
Terry Emerson, the bill will allow
$1.2 billion more in pay and fringe
benefits from Nixon’s plan.

“If their program is imple-
mented immediately,” Emerson
said, “the draft can end much
sooner than the two-year date pro-
posed by President Nixon.”

Hatfield and’ Goldwater’s bill  

attempts to make the military
more attractive through increas-
ed pay scales, thus rendering the
draft unnecessary. The Nixon plan
also does this, but on a smaller
scale.

In case of a national emergen-
cy, however, the Goldwater-Hat
field bill provides for a standby
draft system that could be tem-
porarily implemented.

Congressman Hebert indicated
that open hearings would take

place in the House as soon as the 
new Armed Services Committee 1

is organized. He could give no
date as to when the legislation
would reach the floor, however.

“Knowing this Congress and
how they like to talk, I couldn’t
hazard a guess,” he said.

An organizational meeting
of a Student Tenants Union
will be held Thursday at 7 p.m
in 305 SU. Students desiring to

register valid complaints or to
participate in initiating Iega
action are invited to attend.

 Before concluding, Freeman

condemned suggestions that the

- city levy a tax on the University

. and other non-profit institutions.
 “It must be recognized,” Free-

 man said, “that non-profit insti-

 tutions have a very close margin

_ ' between expenses and income.”

for payment of local taxes,” the

 Shelters Nearly Ready
 PPHISBS -F0llowing L0ngDelay

by BOB GEDEKOH

Relief is apparently near for-
the shivering commuters who
wait daily for buses on Forbes and
.Fifth Aves. The first bus shelter
should be erected this week and
the second will follow shortly.

According to Alex Kaminsky,
acting head of the Project Service
Department, the year-old project
is nearly complete.

The building of the structures
was proposed early last year by
the Commuter Association (CA),
but completion was delayed by
procedural red tape within the
city and the University.

Estimates were received from
various companies, including one
from United Plate Glass for $3,-
800. The project was frozen until
April, however, because of the
University's financial crisis.

Later, it was discovered that
the estimate was for smaller
shelters and that $6,200 more was

needed. Paul Hensler, then presi-

dent of the CA, applied for and re-
ceived this money from the Uni-
versity.

An enlarged Freshman Year
Committee (FYC) is expected to
develop a new alternative to the
defeated Prologue Program by

early Fall.

Dean Jerome Schneewind of
the College of Arts and Sciences
said that he hopes the committee
will include three objectives in a
flexible, perhaps Credit/No En-
try, curriculum proposal.

“A small class resource, some
self-directed classwork and a
method of evaluating student ac-
complishment,” he-said, “would
produce a genuine organic pack-
age for curriculum reform.”

Each department here has been
asked to submit the names of two
faculty members interested in
curriculum change for freshmen.
The College of Arts and Sciences
Cabinet ‘has also been asked to
appoint student members to a new
FYC.

Dr. Steven Rosen, Political Sci-
ence, said that the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences vote on the Pro-
logue Program was “a vote of no
confidence for the Arts and Sci-
ences Review Committeef What
we need now,” he said, “are ser-
ious representatives of all stu-

dents and faculty. We’ve got to

make it the business of every fac- 

ulty member to know what’s go—
ing on.” —

Professor David Bramhall, Eco-
nomics, is less optimistic about
the possible program plans that
the FYC will suggest. “They’ll
come up with something along the

same lines as the present curri—'-

clum,” he predicted.

Bramhall is pessimistic about
the curriculum reforms “in the
short run,” though. “The Univer-
sity will eventually initiate some-
thing like the Prologue Program
in the future,” he said. ‘

“The issue is not what is taught,
but how learning happens. We
wanted to create a new environ-
ment for learning to happen,” he
said. “Now we won’t have the
benefit of trying something new,
and having the assurance that it
iS—-or isn’t-conducive to learn-'
ing.” -

Rosen has already outlined a
new proposal which utilizes the
Prologue Group idea. Distribu-
tion-like courses are planned for
morning sessions, with a Prolo-
gue group in early afternoon to

‘serve as a discussion session. A

regular, term-long course, or per-
haps two six-week courses are
planned for the afternoon.

“I feel that this type of curri-
culum will put the Prologue Group

‘ into a relative structure—maybe

it will click,” he said. “With a
serious group of truly interested
faculty and staff to evaluatethis,
along with other suggestions, I

. feel curriculum reform is immin-

ent. The time for studies is quick-
ly coming to an end,” he added,

“and the time for action is soon‘-

coming. ”

Handicapped Study Underway,

by JIM MAC

The University’s Special Edu-
cation and Rehabilitation De-
partment is conducting a study
to improve conditions for phy-
sically handicapped students.

“One of our purposes,” said
Dr. Robert Newman, Chairman
of the Department, “is to deter-
mine the accessibility of each
building on campus to the phy-
sically-handicapped student. The
main problems we’ve looked at
so far are architectural barriers
such as curbs, entrances, stairs,
and toilet facilities.

Inaccessible Toilets

“Did you know,” asked Dr.
Newman, “that many University
buildings have toilet areas com-
pletely inaccessible to the wheel-
chaired student? Or that a wheel-
chaired student cannot get to
the second floor of the Cathedral,
or cross from Schenley Hall to
Hillman Library‘? Probably you
haven‘t looked at things this
way, but the handicapped stu-
dent does.”

A physically handicapped per-
son, as defined by the study, is
anyone lacking full use or con-
trol of any part of his body. This
includes wheelchair students,
those with crutches or braces,
students who have lost one or
more limb, those with back in-
juries or heart conditions, or
those having a visual or hearing
deficiency.

According to David Weir,
Special Education and Rehabili-
tation research assistant and co-
worker on the study, the lack of
curb-cuts is among the more ser-
ious physical obstacles that be-
set handicapped students.

“We have only three within
the University, and we certainly
need more.”

When asked why there aren’t
more, Weir replied, “One big
reason is that the City requires
a single permit for each cut
made . . . they will not grant a
blanket permit. Single permits
needlessly require additional
time and money.”

Bus System Lambasted

Mentioning the difficulties to
the handicapped afforded by the
University’s many revolving and
narrow doors, Weir also deplor-
ed the lack of special elevator
service. In addition, he criti-
cized the University’s bus sys-
tem.

“Although the athletic and
physical developmental depart-
ments encourage the disadvan-
taged. it is difficult and often
times impossible for the serious-
ly handicapped to use the Hill
complex. What is needed is a
bus system_that can accommo-
date the wheelchair student."

Part One of the Department’s
report—-dealing with architectural
barriers — is finished.

Part Two—-on attitudes—is still
to be completed.

“We surveyed each instructor,“
said Weir, “and although all the
questionnaires have not been re-
turned, some impressions can be
formed. It seems that most facul-
ty members have a favorable at-
titude toward the handicapped
student.
in their classes and most take
them to be as competent (all
things being equal) as the non-
handicapped student.

“Instructors in certain areas,”
he continued‘ “such as fine arts
or engineering, are reluctant to
encourage the blind or seriously
disabled to take up, for example,
sculpture or mechanical engin-
eering. But on the whole, the

- faculty’s attitude is favorable.”

Public Uninformed

Weir believes the major prob-
lem is attitude is the public‘s
lack of knowledge. “Many people
shy away from the handicapped
person, because they do not
know how to deal with them.
Education of the non-handicap-
ped about the handicapped may
be needed.”

The purpose of the present stu-
dy is solely to enumerate the
problems of the physically han-
dicapped and report these find-
ings to the Administration, which
may then act upon them. The
study is to be completed and
printed before the end of the
winter term.

helters Almost Read

(Continued from Page 2)

Cost of the shelters is now es-
timated at around $14,500, $4,000
of which is for the cement pads
erected by the Physical Plant.

The erection of the shelters
was contracted outside of the
Physical Plant because they
employ no members of the Gla-
ziers and Steel Erectors-Unions.

In addition to financial worries,
planners of the project needed two
variances, one from the City Plan-
ning Commission and one from the
Department of Public Works, in ’
order to erect the shelters.

Applications for these vari-
ances were submitted last spring,
but over the summer, the staffs
of the city departments changed
due to the 1969 mayoralty elec-
tion and the city lost track of the
applications.

This fall, Dan McFadden, exe-
cutive assistant to the Vice-Chan-
cellor for Student Affairs, and

John Baginski, chairman of the

Shelter Committee of the CA, re- ,1 I

applied for the variances and the
hearing was set for Nov. 6.

On Nov. 9, the project was plac-
ed onthe production schedule of A
United Plate Glass, which esti-
mated completion in six weeks,
Permission of _the city was re-

ceived in late November and the  I

project was underway, under the

direction of Kaminsky, who had 

the cement slabs prepared.
After a seriesiof deadlines and,

postponements, the “final” dead-.

line for completion was set as the
week~of Jan. 18. Then a wall, col-

lapsed at a local school and the 

contractor was forced to make

emergency repairs there in lieu  

of working on the shelters.

Kaminsky has received a prom-
ise from United Plate Glas that

the first shelter will be completed .- 9“ ” '

Go Beyond Words to Curb Social Injustice

by PAUL LE BLANC
“You are what you eat,” wrote
the German naturalist—philoso-
pher, Ludwig Feuerbach in the
first half of the 19th century. A
supporter of the Irish national

. liberation struggle, he lamented

that the diet of potatoes preva-
lent in Ireland was sapping that
country's vitality. After all, how
can you make a revolution if
you have “sluggish potato blood”?
His solution was —— beans!

While this sounds rather silly,
perhaps it was an improvement
over some of his fellow philoso-
phers who adhered to the pro-
position: “You are what you

, think.”

Exasperated with the Prussian
authoritarianism to which they
were subject, they persuaded

themselves that by telling each
other how irrational the status
quo was, they were actually
' bringing about a momentous re-
volution. Yet somehow Prussian
authoritarianism survived the on-
slaught of their various “critical
philosophies. ’ ’ .

A hundred years later, Jean-
Paul Sartre insisted: “You are
your life and nothing else.”
While not the first man to say
this, he said it with particular
force, and it was tested in the
fire of resistance to the Nazi
occupation of France.

If you believe in the need for
freedom. and social ‘ justice, you
must live your life according to
these beliefs or they mean noth-
ing; words divorced from action
are nothing more than words. It’s
what you do that counts.

 

Students who are aware of var-
ious irrationalities and profound
injustices can object that they
don’t have the power to change
the world. Even after‘ several

years of much-publicized social

protest, injustice persists.

Why should people take risks
or tire themselves out when so
little is accomplished? One
might just as well try to change
the world by eating Feuerbach’s
beans!

What To Do

But there are two flaws in this
argument. First, it fails to deal
with Sartre’s challenge. If we do
nothing to oppose horror and in-
justice, by default we condone
and — in a sense/— become a part
of them,

Second, there are relevant and

Repression ‘Bigger’ than Kent

(The letter that follows is
from Tom Lough, Associate Pro-
fessor of Sociology at Kent State
University and one of 25 indicted
byﬁthe grand jury after the shoot-
ings .last May. It was written
to a friend, Daniel Havens, in-
structor of English at Southern
-Illinois University and forward-
ed to the Pitt News by Maynard
Duncan, representative of the
Human Relations commission.

1, too, have decided, on bal-
ance, to trust the jury system . .
Otherwise I would not have been
around to receive your letter.
But I also know that it is only
because I am white and middle-

. class that I can hope to arrange -

for that luxury. Legal justice is
a luxury of the rich, and al-

.e though most of us will probab-
, ly be acquitted once the cases
, . are tried outside of Ohio, and per-

haps once outside of Portage
County, the cost of trials and ap-
peals will probably run into six
figures. And it may take as long
as five years.

It is an important case here,
which concerns academic free-
dom and the rights of dissent
everywhere. The

American University. I was sin-
gled out not for inciting to riot
(however that might be constru-

I am a visible symbol of free
dissent in the classroom and on
campus.

COLLEGE PRESS SERVICE
Ever heard of Qui Tam?

No, you can’t get it at a Chin-
ese restaurant. And it’s not a vil-

lage in South Vietnam.

Qui Tam is a venerable old
legal principal "which allows you,
the individual citizen, to file suit
in the name of the government
against people who break certain
laws, and then collect half of the
fine for a conviction.

The idea has been getting a
lot of attention lately coupled
with another crusty old law call-
ed the Refuse Act of 1899, which
forbids anyone or any group from
throwing pollutants into any
navigable waters in the United
States without a permit.

“Navigable waters” are defin-
ed as rivers, lakes, streams, or
their tributaries sufficient to
float a boat or log at high water.

Permits are issued by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, but
since the Corps has traditionally
concerned itself chiefly with
dredging, filling, and construc-

‘indictments P

.. actions

much of a radical, and as for be-_
ing a. “trouble-maker,” all of my
efforts have been within the
“system.” The troubles I have
made have been minor ones to
which the system has accom-
modated (and thus reformed).
Which is to say that the thing

that has happened to me can

happen to anyone who is not
completely orthodox.)

Repression does not happen all
at once. As. the movie of that
title puts it, “The seasons change,”
and people come and go, but the
forces _,of bigotry gradually gain
footholds here and there, on some
days but not others, until‘ the
who1e~-society has moved a not-
iceable and perhaps unretrace—
able step away from freedom.

The Kent State indictments

are symptoms of the ways in
which universities are being at-

tacked everywhere. But our case '

is so blatant that it can and
should serve as a rallying point
for us and others, and as a sig-
nal that we must all take the of-
fense. Our lawyers are begin-
ning that offense now in the
Federal as well as the local
courts, and they must be sup-
ported.

But there is also a need for
political support, nation-wide, in
the form of students and faculty
who self-consciously realize and
exercise their rights. Until and
unless that happens, what hap-
pened to the Kent State 25 will
be repeated more and more fre-

The People can Attack ThekPio||ulter

tion, relatively few permits have
ever been issued. And those who
have them (mostly industries) of-
ten violate permit provisions by
dumping untreated discharges
into the water.

What all this means is that
now you can proceed directly to
your local neighborhood indus-
trial polluter, gather some infor-
mation and samples, and then file
a suit which could bring a fine
of not more than $2,500 or less
than $500 for each day of viola-
tion, of which you get, half. It
could also get the polluter thrown
in jail for not less than 30 days
nor more than 1 year, which is
unlikely but nice to think about.

Use of the 1899 Refuse Act
and the Qui Tam concept have
been strongly advocated recent-
ly by the House Subcommittee
on Conservation and Natural Re-
sources, led by its chairman,
Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wisc.).
Reuss himself has filed Qui Tam
against four polluting
companies in Milwaukee.‘

JThe Subcommittee has just

quently, and less and less revo-
cably.

Perhaps I repeat the obvious,
but the situation here has made
me very much aware that free-
dom presupposes continual con-
flict: It is never won, and each
generation has to fight for it all
over again.

Any generation that stops fight-
ing for it may lose“-"it also for
future generations. And freedom
is the freedom to dissent and to
disagree with those in power. As
I. F. Stone notes, you are free to
agree openly with the govern-
ment everyplace, including Hai-

A ti, Angola, etc.

I think that's what the Kent
State 25 is all about. i

Nostalgia. I too treasure the
old days. But my experience
here has made me realize the oth-
er game is for real. I am no long-
er a person, but a symbol of dis-
sent and academic freedom.

As for straight thinking‘Ameri-
cans, the majority (CBS poll, Oc-
tober 25) thinks the National
Guard did right in murdering
four and wounding nine stu-
dents on May 4, all of the stu-
dents being more than 60 yards
away from them; two (of the
murdered) being casual bystand-
ers, under conditions under
which the FBI has said the shoot-
ing was unnecessary, unwarrant-
ed and inexcusable. ‘

It is bigger than Portage Coun-
ty, and I fear for our survival.

Actions and the 1899 Refuse Act;

exactly how to go about collect-

Besides the Reuss suits, two
other Qui Tam actions have been

filed recently, one by a Seattle 

attorney and the other by an or-
ganization of bass fishermen in
Alabama. Many environmental-
ists are hoping a lot more suits
will be filed this fall.

“This is a beautiful project for
college students and ecology
groups,” asserts Clem Dinsmore,
legal assistant of the Conserva-
tion and Natural Resources Sub-
committee, who helped research
and prepare the report- “It’s a
great way to go after pollu-
ters.” ‘

_ ditionally

intelligent things that concerned
people can_ do. Specific things,
right now, here in Pittsburgh‘.
For example: 4,

1. Last year thousands of tra-
impoverished farm
workers finally won union rec-
ognition as well as greatly im-
proved working conditions and
living conditions from California
grape growers. Thousands more
are now locked in a life-or-death
struggle with the lettuce indus-
try, again using the strike and
the boycott, and again asking for
our help. The University YWCA
(extension 281) has information
on what you can do.

2. Angela Davis is a brilliant

young philosophy professor and
a beautiful human being; she

is also a black activist and mem-

ber of the Communist Party who
is being framed on a murder
charge. She stands in a glorious
tradition — that of Joe Hill, Sac-
co and Vanzetti, Angelo Herndon,
and many other principled radi-
cals who were also victimized by
right-wing politicians and up-
tight government bureaucrats

anxious to intimidate the op-.

pressed and the rebellious.

 

   
   

Dinsmore recommends that stu-
dent groups combine the talents
of law schools and biology de-
partments to keep legal fees at
a minimum and quality of evi-
dence at a maximum.

Basically,‘ once you find" a
polluter to attack, you. should
prepare a (detailed statement,
sworn to before a notary public,
setting forth:

The nature of the refuse mater-
ial discharged:

The source and method of dis-
charge; ‘

The location, name and ad-
dress of the person or persons
causing or contributing to the
discharge;

Each date on which the dis-

' charge occurred;

The names and addresses of
all persons known to you, in-
cluding yourself, who saw or
knows about the discharges and
could testify about them if ne-
cessary;

A statement that the discharge
is not authorized by Corps per-

We must overcome intimida-
tion and ensure Angela Davis’
right to a fair trial and her free-

dom. If you call Jim Ferlo (682-‘

8913), you can learn more about
this case and about how you can
help publicize it.

' 3. In spite of frustration and
confusion among those who op-
pose the continuation of the war
in Southeast Asia, and inspite of
soothing rhetoric from the gov-
ernment, the war continues. The
National Student Association and
other groups throughout the coun-
try have initiated a campaign

for a People’s Peace Treaty to i

help build pressure for an end
to the war. A Pitt People’s Peace
Treaty Committee has been form-
ed to participate in this effort.
Those interested should come to

from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. '

ways, in the advance toward

mit, or, if a permit was granted,

state facts showing that the all- _,

eged violater, is not complying
with any condition of the per-
mit;

If the waterway into which

the discharge occurred is not,

commonly known as navigable,
or as a tributary to a navigable
waterway, state facts to show
such status;

Where possible, photographs
should be taken, and samples of
the pollutant or foreign sub-
stance collected in a clean jar
which is then sealed. These
should be labeled with informa-
tion showing who took the
photograph or sample, where, and
when, and how; and who retain-
ed custody of the film jar. '

This will be your basic am-
munition in the suit, and should
be filed in a U.S. district court,
which apparently have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and decide
such suits. The Supreme Court
has upheld Qui Tam suits in the
past on the basis that the citi-

zen—informer has a financial in-“-M’

terest in "the fine and therefore
can sue to collect it. '

°Love’ Criticism °Heartless’

Editor: The Pitt News:

“Take a Bag-O’-Laughs,” Pat
0’Brien says. Well, for some-
one who obviously has no feel-
ings, he might get a big kick
out of doing something like that.

How anyone can say that the
movie, Love Story is ‘fawful” is
beyond me. Granted, it is mak-
ing a mint, but so have other
good movies. Love Story is a
sight to see, not “Just for people
to say that they have been there.”
but because it is a good book
Segal has written and an even
better movie.

When one sees the movie, the
best lines from. the book have

been used, and the characters '

come alive. Ryan and Ali play
Oliver and Jennifer well.

Ryan O’Neal was not at all the
same type of character portray-
ed in Peyton Place. He learned

‘how to act in the old series, and

made Love Story seem real. As
for All MaGraw, Goodbye Col-
umbus was a far cry from Love
Story, and I doubt very much
whether seeing her in the form-
er makes anyone think of her in
the latter. ‘

Ali certainly plays Jennifer with
aggressiveness; in the book the
lines sound sort of crude, but
when one sees the‘ movie, they
fit right in place. Tell me that,
in the first bedroom-study scene,
when she said, “Oliver, please,

wouldja,” that this wasn’t ag-A

gressive?
Admittedly, there were parts

of the movie that were a little
far-fetched like when the Bar-

. retts went from near poverty to

an exclusive apartment soon af-

ter his graduation. And maybe
people would be a little more up-
set than Ali was when she found
out she was going to die.

This shows what a strong char-
acter she was, though. Both of
them had to be throughout most
of the movie. Their college days
were so realistic, though, - their
studying together, taking an in-
terest in each others’ lives, and
even their sleeping together.
They were in love, and accord-
ing to many open-minded people
today, that makes being in love
even better.

The line, “love is never hav-
ing to say you’re sorry,” may
seem idealistic, but actually we
could learn something from it.
Many of us, as I find myself do-
ing, won’t accept any kind of ap-
ology from loved ones except,
“I’m sorry”.

On the contrary to what Pat
0’Brien says, don’t take a “Bag—
O-Laughs” to Love Story, take a
handkerchief because you’ll need
it. If you have any kind of heart
at all, it will be a sad exper-
ience, but rewarding when you
see the kind of love that is shar-
ed.

Massey’s "Good Wine’ Steamed

Editor: The Pitt News,

Just a few reflections on the
achievement of excellence, its
means and criteria, inspired by
your cover story “Philosophy
Excels”, (The Pitt News,) Jan 20
and Prof. Massey’s letter in your
issue of Jan. 27.

The history of the Philosophy
department is described as a slow
accretion of talent, each new ad-
dition being chronologically de-
fined, as one would date a wine
of good vintage.

The historian cannot help but
ask how such a harmonious or-
der was achieved; how else than
by “the strong, loyal but dis-
criminating and judicious support
of the University Administration”
(the mind boggles at the impli-
cations of the “but”). In other
words, if money and power are
forthcoming, everything is pos-
sible. The rags—to-riches myth
need detain us no longer.

All this is history. The criter-
ion of productivity set by Prof.
Massey’s letter seems to be a
more promising one for discus-
sion, since one might assume that
it could constitute an objective
standard by which departments
measure their progress toward
excellence. -

Various proposals are emanat-

ing at present from administra-

tive circles which tend to evalu-
ate productivity in order to im-

* prove it.

One such project deals with
the concept of “contact hours”,
a term with vaguely obscene
overtones suggesting extra-cur-
ricular activities. In the letter
before me, the term “producti-
vity” is linked with the number
of books published by a faculty
member “at last count”.

It seems to me that a more
rigorous standard could be found,
since monographs may be of
varying sizes and lengths; my
first approach was to consider
weighing as a method of mea-
surement, but then of course the
problem of the quality of paper

and the thickness of the binding‘

intervenes and resists standardi-
zation.

Two opposing basketball styles
will clash tonight at 8 p.m. in
the Field House as the high scor-
ing West Virginia Mountaineers
face the defense-minded Pitt
Panthers in the 113th meeting
between the tri-state rivals.

This season, the Mountaineers
have averaged 87 points a game
in compiling a 6-8 record. They
' have broken the century mark in
five contests.

Coach Buzz Ridl’s squad 9-6
plays a ball control type of of-
fense hitting for an average of
74 points a game and limiting
their opponents to just 69 points.

“They are one of the strongest
teams that we will face all year,”
said Ridl. “They have been scor-
ing a lot in recent games, and
they have great depth on the
bench, using 9 or 10 players in
a game.”

Leading the Mountaineers is
6-2 junior Wil Robinson of near-
by Uniontown.

Last year,._Robins0n was named
to the Tri—State top five players
after he hit 20 points a game as a
sophomore.

This season, Robinson has net-
ted over 23 points a game and has
been WVU’s leading scorer in 9
games. ’

An interesting matchup may
occur between Robinson and Buz-
zy Harrison, the Panther’s super
sub. Both were teammates on the

11.1 shooting average from the field. This year
he is right back around that mark. He is lead-

’ ing the team in rebounding, but he still feels he

could be doing better. On the whole, though,
things seem to be going pretty good for one of
the two tallest men ever to play for Pitt.

“I’m really happy I came to Pitt,” said O’Gor-
ek. “Now that I’m starting to know the players
and the coaching, things are falling into place.”

The big, English major added that he had
been accustomed to a more run-and-shoot game

' in high school, but he prefers the slower, more

disciplined style of Ridl.

A unique feature of Paul’( playing style is his
tendency to push off the wrong foot when" he
shoots. “It’s something I’ve tried to change,” he

said “but it keeps coming back. ‘The coaches feel ’

it’s too late to change.” ‘

it will depend upon -how the
game goes.”

In addition to Robinson, Sam
Ogelsby, a junior college trans-
fer, poses a strong offensive
threat. He presently is scoring 16
points per game.

“Ogelsby is very impressive
and he is an exceptionally fine
player,” said Ridl.

The two teams have faced four
common opponents this season.

last year is 51.7 per cent.

Last year, the two teams split
their home and away series, with
each squad winning on the away
court. Both games were extreme-
ly close, with the margins being
one and five points.

Ridl recognizes the importance
of this game of keeping any Pan-

WVU Coach Chuck Winsor and his little Mountaineers are
coming off of a 94-78 victory over the Penn State Frosh and are
sporting a 4-1 record. As pleased as he is with the performance of

his freshmen to date, the coach
anticipates more difficult games
coming up.

“It is always’ nice to win on
the road,” said Winsor, “but we
anticipate the more difficult
games this year remain before
us.” He includes Pitt, who the
little Mountaineers play twice,
as one of the tougher schools
they will encounter.

“Pitt is a strong, physical
club,” Winsor commented. “They
have boys 6-9, 6-7, and 6-5 along
with a couple of good, aggres-
sive guards. And they play real
well together.

West Virginia, at the same
time, is coming into Pittsburgh
with a team that has averaged
86.4 points per game in their
first five contests. Leading their
balanced attack is guard John
Vidovich who has averaged 21.2
points a game.

Bob Hornstein, WVU’s center
is averaging 9.8 and is flanked
by forwards, Bernie Kirchner,
and Charlie Hickox. Kirchner is
averaging 14.7 while Hickox
chips in with a 13 point per game
average.- Rounding out the start-
ing five for the Little Mountain-
eers is Chris Sprenger.

“We haven't had a chance to
scout West Virginia,” said Cub
Coach Tim Grgurich. “Every-
time we went down there we
arrived just in time to see the
varsity play.”

In any event, the Cubs will go

into the contest withthe same

basic game plan as in previous
games.

“We’re going to play our regu-
lar man-to—man defense,” said
Grgurich. “The offense has been
up and down this year. A lot of
the boys are coming along well.
(Bill) Swartzman has shown great
improvement. Mickey Martin and
our inside guys did a real fine
job against Robert Morris. Our
offense just didn’t get up the
momentum.

“Jim Bolla has been out with
a knee‘ injury,” “He didn’t

don't know whether he’ll be

Keystone Overcomes
Madhouse H oopsters

by MIKE ZONIS

One of its most exciting games of the.Intramural basketball sea-
son was played Monday night at Trees Hall Gym when undefeated
Keystone took on the once-beaten Madhouse.

Madhouse jumped out to an early lead and kept it until the last min-
ute of play. It was only then that the aroused Keystone players could

take the lead and hold on to win, 41-39.

In the early moments of the game it looked as if Madhouse would

be too tough for the cold Keystone
team. Steve Tritch, captain of
Madhouse scored six straight
points while his defensive team
shut out Keystone. At the end of
the first half, Tritch had 10 points

but was in foul trouble. The high

scorer for Keystone had only
three points. Madhouse led at
halftime, 20-15.

In the second half the outlook
remained bleak for Keystone. The
foul shooting of Tony Preidis and
Randy Young’s hot hand kept
Madhouse in the lead by a margin
of five points. Chuck Heward, a
Keystone ace, fouled out with five
minutes remaining in the game.

Then Keystone came back. With

four minutes left, John Fedorka ‘

and Joe Brown developed hot
hands and cut the lead to one
point. Three minutes later, Prei-
dis of Madhouse put in two foul
shots and again the game appear-
ed to be going in Mad’s favor.

which could only tally one point on

score 41-39.

 Girl On Track Team? 

by VINCE Di NARDO

With the success that track coach Jim Banner has been having
with his track team, one might begin to wonder if he employs some sort
of mysterious training technique for his athletes.

Well, the secret it out.

Banner has a runner by the name of Martin running with the track

team daily.

What’s so strange about that? Nothing, except that Martin’s first

name is Kitty, and Kitty is a girl.

Actually, Miss Martin is not on
the track team. She loves track,
and Banner permits her to run
with his team as a training device
for her.

“When I first approached him,
he hit the ceiling,” she said, “but.
when he saw I was serious, he
consented.” ‘

Serious? She’s very serious.

“I want to go to the nationals in
the women’s quarter mile,” she
said. “To qualify you have to run
the quarter in 57.0. Right now,
I’m running it at 61.0.”

Miss Martin has to shave four
seconds from her time to qualify
and she seems confident of attain-
ing it. Kitty is delighted that she
is training with the male mem-
bers of a track team, and she
doesn’t seem to care that there is
no women’s-track team.

“I like guys (well, she’s a girl
isn’t she?),” she said. “To train
with, that is. These guys like to
run. Girls belly-ache and com-
plain all the time and aren’t seri-
ous in training.”

Miss Martin first became in-
terested in track as she observed
her brother running. “He was on
a track team, and I like it so I
triedit.”

, She also denies that track and

femininity don’t jive.

“I like track,” she stated. “It’s
good conditioning, and besides I
don’t think that running track
makes me less of a girl.”

Her femininity is not to be de-
nied. The looks on some of the
faces that observe her as she runs
can verify that she’s a female.

A woman training with a group
of men could concievably present
occasional problems. But Kitty’s
determination in achieving her
goal seems to make them worth
while.

Has anybody tried to make a
pass at her?

“I’ll never tell,” she jokingly
answers.

Since she began her training,
Kitty has had a comple of good
performances. She made the trip
to the Washington CYO meet with
the track team at her own expense
and finished fourth in the wom-
en’s quarter mile.

‘.‘My mother and I went to
Washington,” she said. “I finish-
ed fourth, but it was the best time
I ever did.

Last Saturday, Miss Martin
also ran in the Pitt Track Classic
and finished second in the quarter
mile. Her time has also been im-
proving. At the Field House she
ran the quarter mile in 60.0.
