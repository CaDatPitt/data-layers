Speaker tries to dispel myths about rape

By Chris Kocher
For The Pitt News

One in four women are sexually assaulted
before leaving college, and 84 percent know

9 their attacker, according to Julie Evans of

Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.

Evans spoke Thursday at Pitt’s Campus
Women’s Organization meeting to make
members aware of the prevalence of rape on
college campuses and to give advice on
avoiding attacks.

She also tried to dispel some of the myths
about rape in our society. .

“The big one is that the woman was askin
for it,” Evans said. “Even if you made a bad
choice, that doesn’t mean you deserve to be
raped.”

Another myth is that rape is an act of sex,
while it is really a way to have power over
the victim. A third myth is that a woman who

doesn’t resist hasn’t been raped, Evans said.
Evans said she sees victims reporting sexu-

- al assaults as very important, since it may

give other women the courage to come for-
ward.

If no one talks, then “it becomes an endless
cycle of people not saying anything,” Evans
said. 9

Preventing sexual assault requires women
to remember that “until men stopraping,

every man is a potential rapist,” Evanssaid.

Of course, she added, such a statement “isn’t
looking at men as individuals, since not all
men do.”

“Unfortunately, statistics and studies show
that there isn’t really anywhere that is ‘safe’
all the time,” Evans said.

Better communication between partners can
be crucial in stopping date rape. Defining
limits beforehand, for example, can prevent

As a governance group representing

Changing the Channel 

American TV programm

By Nicole Walz
For The Pitt News

For some Pitt students,
American television program-
ming just isn’t appealing. Some
of these students are members
of Pitt’s British Television
Society.

According to one of the co-
presidents of the organization,
John Dulin, “This is now the
only source where you can
watch British television.”

The British Television Society
began in 1991, when two stu-
dents,_ now-seniors Joe Foner
and Chris Kocher, found each
other by word of mouth and
realized they shared a common
interest in a British program
called “The Prisoner.”

Foner said, “It started as four
of us in the Tower’s TV lounge
watching it on WQEX.”

Got a
HOT
news
tip? We
know
they're
out
there.
Call
Steve,
John or
Mark at
648-
7983.

As the group expanded from
four members to seven, the stu-
dents said they decided to form
an official Pitt organization.

“Chris and Joe made up a
constitution and went to the
[Student Government Board] to
find out the procedures,” said
Dulin.

They then had 10 people to
start the organization. Since they
had originally began watching
the only 17 episodes of “The
Prisoner” in existence, it was
called The Prisoner Club up
until this year.

“‘The Prisoner’ drew us all
together, but we were interested
in other British television
shows,” Foner said.

According to members, there
has been a positive response to
the group’s name change.

The British Television
Society now shows additional

mg no

programs such as “Red Dwarf,”
“Doctor Who,” “Blackadder,”
“‘Allo ‘Allo” and movies by
Monty Python.

Now in its sixth semester, the
British Television Society meets
once a week, has a membership
of over 25 students and 3 co-
presidents — Dulin, Kocher and
Matt Green.

“We have co-presidents
because it is a pretty loose
club,” Dulin said. “We don’t
want power ego trips.”

The members of The British
Television Society not only
watch these programs but dis-

- cusses them as well. For exam-

ple, with “The Prisoner,’-’ “it
leaves everything open to
debate,” said Foner. “We appre-

ciate British TV for being higher

quality than American televi-
sion.”
Some members did mention

American programs such as
“Picket Fences” ,”Twin Peaks”
and “Star Trek” as ones that
were slightly comparative to
British shows but said their
main focus remains on British
programming.

“We expanded the scope of
the club. We’ll try anything
[British] once, and if people like
it, we’ll continue to show it,”
said Dulin.

Although its only had two
meetings so far this semester,
the British Television Society
has drawn in new members.

Freshman Ingrid Mercer said,
“I saw them at the activities fair
and thought they were funny. I
like British T.V. American T.V.
is really formula and hokie for

tappealing to some Pitt students

me.”

Kocher, Dulin and Foner are
all seniors. They worry about
the ‘future of the club.

“We are looking for newer
people to take the reigns and
push the club into the future,”
Foner said.

“My main focus is getting
more people to carry on the
administrative focus of it. I
would like to see people like
Ingrid continue this,” said Dulin.

Dulin said the organization is
important because “it exposes
people to British culture.”

The British Television Society
is always looking for new mem-
bers, Dulin said.

“The interest is strong enough
that people will come.”

Telescope

°From page I

enable Pitt faculty to partici-
pate more in‘ space projects,
Hazard said. Researchers
in Pittsburgh can receive
data from the telescope in
Chile through telescope
links.

“It would make Pittsburgh
an extremely attractive place
for aspiring astronomers,”
Hazard said. It would also
impart important analytical
skills to researchers, he said.
According to Hazard, these
skills would benefit anybody
involved in subjects ranging
from the general sciences to
business. «

“We’re not just talking
about a toy for a few
astronomers,” he said.

The project is a good sci-
entific investment, said Pitt
physics professor Richard
Pratt. But the question is
whether it’s “better to spend

the money on such a big pro-
ject, or is it better to spread it
around?”

Wion said there are “con-
siderable needs” in the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
and throughout the uni-
versity, that need more fund-
ing. During the UPBC
meeting, FAS Dean Peter
Koehler voiced concerns
about the state of existing
undergraduate physics labo-
ratories.

But “it may be that some
donors would give only for
the telescope” and not for
other purposes, Wion said.

The astronomy department
has tried to‘ obtain a large
telescope for the past 15
years, Hazard said. The study
of astrophysics is one of the
‘most exciting in science and
one of the high priorities of
Pitt’s physics department, he
said.

“We tried desperately for
many years to get access to a
large telescope,” he said.

The chancellor has had an
interest in strengthening the
astronomy program at Pitt
ever since he arrived on cam-
pus, Wion said.

“[There’s] nothing wrong
with that,” Wion said. “I
don’t think the chancellor
has a hidden agenda — he
has been very open and frank
about it.”

O’Connor said at the
UPBC meeting that he
will seek outside
donations to fund the pro-
ject, but will use his discre-
tionary funds, which amount
to $4 million, if outside
donations do not meet the
cost.

Any project that costs more
than $1 million must be
referred to the board of
trustees budget committee,

said Leon Haley, vice-chan-
cellor for student and public
affairs.

The budget committee will
review the telescope project
within the context of two
principles, Haley said.

First, the project should
be incorporated into the
long-range academic plan
of the university. Secondly,
the project will have to
be liquidated with
funding outside of the uni-
versity.

“We shouldn’t go ahead
[with the project] until there
is strong evidence that it can
be funded by gifts,” Wion
said.

The Magellan Project is
one of a list of eight capital
projects. This list, along with
Pitt’s long-range academic
plan, will be presented to the
board of trustees on Oct. 21,
Haley said.

The fish, which can

which looks like a tee-
tering walk. Scientists say
the fish travel across land

dence halls].” ‘ " I’ 1‘

Miller also said that RSA ‘:

is planning to provide stu-
dents with more social activ-
ities this semester. RSA has
begun working on the Fall
Fling, a “small carnival”
which will be held in the
Schenley Quadrangle park-
ing lot on Oct. 17. Moss said
the Fall Fling would have
games and free items.

An annual project of RSA

which is currently being

planned is the haunted house
in Holland Hall. Miller said
the event will be open to all
students, as well as children
from Special Olympics and
the Make-A-Wish
Foundation.

In addition, RSA will soon
begin its annual Lothrop
Challenge. Miller said the
challenge is a fundraising
contest between the resi-
dence halls. Each hall selects
a charity and develops a pro-
ject to raise money for their
charity. Miller also said that
he hopes to create a new
committee, the Resident
Activity Committee, to
develop more social pro-
grams for students.

Miller said that in past
years, RSA has not received
a great deal of recognition
and has had problems getting
students involved, but Miller
believes the key to changing
the reputation of RSA is
through planning social
events and finding answers
for students with concerns.

“If we get something done,
or people have fun at an
event, they’ll see our name
and maybe get involved.”

Miller said participation in
RSA is open to any student
who lives in the residence
halls. Each building has a
Hall Council, which holds

weekly meetingsto hear sug— _

gestions and concerns. These
comments are then passed on
to the Executive Board.
Miller said he believes par-
ticipation in Hall Councils is
an important element in the
success of RSA.

“The thing I want to stress
this year is teamwork 
through teamwork, things
get done, and that’s impor-
tant.”

Another telescope project

A telescope project could produce another controversy at Pitt,
a la Mt. Graham. However this time the issue is not environ-
mental, but simply monetary.

Chancellor J. Dennis O.’Connor wants Pitt to join a telescope
project in Chile which would require $8 million in funding.
Some faculty members believe the university should focus more
on funding projects at Pitt.

O’Connor believes the telescope project would make Pitt
more competitive. It could increase Pitt’s astrophysics depart-
ment’s ability to generate research funding, which has been
hampered by the lack of guaranteed telescope time. The astrono-
my department has tried to obtain a large telescope for the past
15 years.

Those who oppose the project believe the money could be
more beneficially spent by “spreading it around.” Phillip Wion,
the chair of the Senate Budget Policies Committee, says that
there are “considerable needs” in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences. The question is whether or not the money can be bet-
ter spent in one large project or in several smaller projects.

O’Connor though has said he will seek outside donations to
fund the project, but will use his discretionary funds, totaling $4
million, if necessary.

The Pitt News agrees with Wion’s statement that, “we
shouldn’t go ahead [with the project] until there is strong evi-
dence that it can be funded by gifts.” If Chancellor O’Connor
can fund this program through outside donations, that would be
great; however if he cannot, then the viability and benefits of
this program must be more closely reviewed.

Homecoming week begins

Today officially marks the start of Pitt’s 1994 Homecoming
Week. Though we wrote an editorial last week calling for the
reformation/abolishment of the Homecoming King and Queen
election, this-should in no way be construed as an "attack by The
Pitt News on Homecoming week itself.

We believe the Homecoming election to be a rather archaic
contest which only has relevance to a minority of Pitt students.
On the other hand, many of the other events provide entertain-
ment and stress relief for all.

Highlighting the week is of course the football game against
West Virginia. The Mountaineers have struggled this season,
and strong home support could help propel Pitt to its second
victory of the season. .

But the football game is~far from the only event this week.
Pitt Program Council is sponsoring. a keg roll, a fireworks and
laser show and other fun events. Highlighting Friday night is

' another installment of Midnight Madness, which marks the offi-

cial beginning of Pitt’s men’s and women’s basketball seasons.

Come to Fitzgerald Field House to cheer on new coach Ralph ’

Willard and get lots of free stuff.

All in all it promises to be an exciting week and The Pitt
News applauds the university for providing such events and
encourages students to take part in the fun.

Double standard for Homecoming contest  

Walking around campus has recently been
a disturbing experience for me. It seems that
no matter where I gol see a sign for a candi-
date for Homecoming King or Queen.

What disturbs me is not so much the fact
that the election is taking place, but that
these signs are, as I said before, everywhere.
I see them inside the Cathedral, outside the
Cathedral, inside the Union, outside the
Union and in just about every other imagin-
able place on campus. These signs have been
put up and have stayed there, even on trees,
longer than I have ever seen a sign stay up. I
have been a member of the University
Democrats for the past three years, and one
of the ongoing struggles of the group is the
tearing down of our signs advertising meet-
ings or political candidates. And we are not
the only group that has had this problem.

Numerous other student groups, namely
the Campus Women’s Organization and
College Republicans have had problems with

Senator Wofford's
campaign vindicated

In a letter to the editor printed in the Oct. 6
issue of The Pitt News, a woman criticized the
Student Government Board for running a parti-
san voter registration table.

She claimed that the table run by SGB was
decorated with signs for Senator Harris
Wofford, who is running for re-election. If she
had bothered to talk to someone at the table
before crying foul, she would have discovered
that the table was actually being run by the
University Democrats, with absolutely no
involvement by the SGB. In fact, the two
groups had separate tables running all week,
which resulted in over 500 students registering
to vote. I extend my thanks to members to
members of the University Democrats and the
SGB, and applaud their efforts.

Furthermore, the Wofford signs did not seem
to deter several Republicans from registering at
our table. In fact, I instructed members of the
University Democrats who were working the
table to register people regardless of party,
despite the fact that our table was partisan. To
do otherwise would be to compromise the
integrity of our group because besides certain
ideological beliefs we may hold, our purpose is
to raise political awareness on campus. It seems
to me that the SGB was trying to do the same
thing.

the removal or defacement of their signs.
These are groups that talk about issues that
mean something. We work for candidates
who have platforms, beliefs, and are trying
to make a difference in this country. We do
not advertise meaningless popularity con-
tests. .

So I implore the administration to do
something about the blanket of paper that
seems to be growing larger every day and is
manifesting itself in places it shouldn’t. If a
student group were to be so bold as to post a
sign on a tree, they would surely be repri-
manded..If we cannot place signs in certain
places on campus, why should a fraternity or
sorority be able to? If they can be assured a
janitor won’t tear down their signs, why
can’t we? There‘ is a double standard at
work, and as I said before, it disturbs me.

Honors frat is for the
Homecoming contest

In response to your editorial of Tuesday, Oct.
4, I would like to say that there was a bit of a
generalization made in your comments about
the Homecoming King/Queen contest, calling
it “little more than a Greek popularity contest.”
In the past, and also for some of the partici-
pants this year, this may be true. But this is not
necessarily the case for all candidates.

There are other organizations out there who
are competing for the titles not necessarily to
gain superficial popularity, but using the con-
test as a form of publicity and public relations,
and also to show that the longtime
monopoly of the Greeks over contests such as
Homecoming can and should be challenged.
Phi Sigma Pi, a national co-ed honor frater-
nity which is in no way related to the Greek
system on campus, is taking up this challenge
by nominating both male and female candi-
dates.

The contest may be outdated, but it is a
way to show school spirit, and get an organiza-
tion’s name known on campus. If other organi-
zations would realize this, and use this oppor-
tunity to get campus-wide exposure, it would
no longer be considered a “Greek popularity
contest.”

Columnist takes a satirical look at fast food service

Q QWelcome to O’Burgers,
sir. May I take your
order?”

“Actually,” I said, “I just got
my order. You gave it to me,
remember?”

A faint glimmer of recogni-
tion crossed his face just
briefly but was immediately
replaced by the familiar
O’Face: happy, smiling and
plastic. “Oh, yes sir. Was there
something else I could help
you with?”

“Um. Yeah. I ordered your
bacon, egg and cheese
O’Biscuit SuperDuper Value
Breakfast Meal, and  well,
here. Look for yourself.” I
pointed to a hard, brown lump
that crumbled as I poked at it.

“Yes, that’s our NEW ‘and
IMPROVED O’Biscuit.” 9

‘‘Improved? How?”

“Well, sir, we here at
O’Burgers are committed to
providing you with only the

safest possible meal. First, we
no lon.ger use any form of lard
or fat in our dough. Nope,
nope, nope. We wouldn’t want
your fragile arteries getting all
clogged up with that vile stuff,
now would we? Secondly, we
use only whole wheat flour.
Unprocessed, unrefined and
ever so much better for you.”
“But it tastes horrible,” I

said.

He continued, undaunted.
“Finally, we no longer use
those disgusting, cholesterol-
laden, salmone11a—infested
eggs. Only the freshest, health-
iest, safest egg ‘substitutes go
into those biscuits.” .

I picked up the thin yellow"
. rectangle that quivered on the

biscuit and stretched it.. “Egg
substitute? That explains this, I
guess.” I let go of one rubbery
end of the rectangle, and it
snapped at the fingertips of my
other hand.

“Oh, Heavens, sir! You
didn’t hurt yourself, did you?”

“Uh, no. I’m fine, really.”

“Thank goodness.” He trem-
bled, obviously shaken by the
close call. “Please be careful,
sir.” _ “

I picked up the thin orange
rectangle. “What about this
cheese?”

“We prefer to think of it as

‘cheese—like,’ sir. Completely,

free of any dairy products.
Healthier, really.”

I lifted the thin brown rec-
tangle. “Let me guess. This

1 isn’t real bacon, either.”

“Ho, ho,” he chortled. It was
the first time I’d everbeen
chortled at in a fast food

, restaurant. Oh sure, I’ve been

chortled at by fine dining
establishments (try ordering
your Steak Tartar well done
and see if you don’t get a chor-

tle or two), but I’d paid extra ‘

for that privilege. “Oh, really,

sir. You’re too, too much. Real
bacon? Would we risk your
cardiovascular health that
way? Of course not. Only top-
grade bacon-flavored soybean
patties will do, you see.”

“Probably keeps the militant
vegetarians happy, too.”

“Bravo, sir! Now,.you’re
catching on!”

I nodded. “Okay, but what
about these hash browns?”

He looked crestfallen. “Oh,
dear. And you were making
such progress, too. Now,
would we endanger your safe-
ty with salt or sugary
ketchup?”

“I understand,” I said. “But
couldn’t you at least cook the
potatoes?”

“Really, sir. You know veg-
etables lo-se their nutritional
value when cooked. Besides,
we couldn’t have you scalding
your tongue on hot, greasy
fried potatoes!”

7

“Heaven forbid,” I muttered.
“Wait. Don’t tell me. This isn’t
real coffee. It’s soybean, right?

None of the nasty side effects a

of caffeine?”

His face glowed with pride.
“Oh, sir! I think you’ve finally
got it!”

“And of course,” I added,
“it’s served at room tempera-
ture to keep me from burning
myself.”

He smiled and whispered.
“Of course, that also keeps our
cost per cup down.”

“I can see why,” I said.
winking conspiratorially.
“Eight million bucks per cup
gets pretty expensive.”

He gave me a brisk, proud
salute. “Have a safe breakfast.
sir.”

“I will,” I said. “But I think
I’ll skip lunch.”

SGB president says voter registration is not biased

In reference to Erika Kendra’s let-
ter published in the Oct. 6 issue of
The Pitt News (“SGB voter drive
shows partisanship”), I would like to
explain the Register Once project and
its targeted audience.

As stated in the letter to the editor
in the Oct. 6 issue of The Pitt News,
Register Once is a project designed
by the non-partisan organization
Lead or Leave, and the Student
Government Board’s intention was to
make voter registration available to
all 14,000 of its constituents, regard-
less of party affiliation or other bias-
es. I would like to thank Ms. Kendra
for her concern.

Ms. Kendra accused the SGB of
having a “blatant bias” toward a par-

ticular candidate since there “were
signs screaming ‘WOFFORD ‘94”’
in a nearby location. The SGB has no
control over what

ticular candidate. Had there been any,
I would have removed them.
Ironically, I was staffing at the same

time as students identi-

groups in the

Register Once pro-
ject was informed
that a political party
would COINCIDENTALLY be regis-
tering voters in the same area. Since I
personal staffed a table at the Union,
I am able to inform you that there
were NO SIGNS on our registration
table displaying the names of a par~

aware that its position
would be compromised
if it took a side in parti-
san politics. Furthermore, the dissen-
sion among Student Government
leaders concerning partisan politics
would disallow the SGB taking a
united stand for one party over
another.

Without united support within
SGB, such an effort would undoubt-
edly fail.

While I have no control over your

interpretation of the volunteer‘

working our registration table, I
would like to thank you for recogniz-
ing her as being “thrilled” to help
you. 7

In the future. please feel free to
bring your concerns directly to the
SGB concerning alleged biases. I am
sure that these concerns would have
been given deserved attention from
the board members working on the
project and/or myself.

Columnist says new Smithsonian exhibit a cultural treason

ebrate the 50th anniversary of the
rid of the Pacific War. In com-
memoration of this historic event the
S.mithsonian’s National Air and Space
Museum in Washington has a display
which will include the Enola Gay, the
B-29 which dropped the bomb. The

I: August 1995, the world will cel-

 

Columnist original script forthe display set off
Tony such controversy and prompted the
Dickensheets outrage of veterans’ groups that the

museum had to appoint an internal
review team. When one looks at the content of the origi-
nal script, the outrage should come as no surprise. Of the
Pacific War it said that “for most Americans  it was a
war of vengeance. For most Japanese, it was a war to
defend their unique culture against western imperialism”
(The Washington Post 8/19/94).

This statement has been changed, but the exhibit still
grossly downplays the barbarous actions of Japan upon
its Asian neighbors from its 1937 invasion of China to
the end of WWII and the downfall of its Greater East
Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere; That Japan’s culture is
unique is undeniable, but to say that Western imperial-
ism was threatening it is simply absurd. Let’s look at the
facts.

There is no doubt that there was a U.S. racism against
the Japanese put forth by both the media and the govem-
ment that simply was much more vicious than that used
against the Gennans. A classic example is the portrayal
of the Japanese soldiers as looking like half-monkey,
half—human while carrying a nude white woman on his
back marching through the streets of America.

However, it is wrong to assert, as some people have,
that the United States decided to drop the bomb on

Hiroshima and Nagasaki purely out of racial hatred
toward the Japanese. In fact, I would argue that it was
just the opposite.

President Truman and those in his administration real-
ized that, although the population was heavily indoctri-
nated with militaristic propaganda, the majority of the
Japanese civilian population were very much unlike
those in the Imperial Army who committed so many
atrocious acts of violence. It seems to me that there were
two very concrete reasons for dropping the atomic
bombs on Japan, both of which are interlinked.

The first reason was to end the war quicker, which the
bombs undoubtedly accomplished. The United States
had only two options to choose from: Truman could
either have sent our military onto the main islands of
Japan to fight hand-to-hand with the Imperial Army,
which at the time still numbered 2 million strong, which
would have delayed the war for probably a year or more.
One need only look at the carnage that happened when
the U.S. Marines captured Okinawa. The human loss of
life was phenomenal with more than 12,000 U.S. sol-
diers being killed along with around 110,000 Japanese
military deaths. In addition, approximately 150,000
civilians died, many of whom chose suicide over surren-
der to an occupying army. p

This leads to the second reason for Truman’s decision
to drop the bomb. Truman clearly did not want to see a
protracted ground war on the Japanese islands which, by
some estimates, may have led to as many as 250,000
deaths and a half a million wounded. While it is clear
that Truman’s first concern was in saving American
lives, it also seems clear that there was no desire to see
millions of Japanese civilians committing seppuku. The
need and timing of the second bombing may be ques-
tioned, but in the final analysis there is little doubt that

Truman’s decision saved many lives on both sides.

That an American museum was, and to an extent still
is, attempting to portray the Americans as bloodthirsty,
culturaldestroyers and the Japanese as being purely vic-
tims is nothing short of an act of treason. Furthermore.
this sort of historical revisionism goes beyond just mere-
ly how to portray American and Japanese actions in
WWII. These kinds of historical lies are being propagat-
ed by this generation’s liberal elite in an attempt at push-
ing their “multicultur ” agenda unto the mainstream by
Orwellian means. This type of revisionism does nothing
at all to educate our children about our past. I saw this
very clearly when I visited the Hiroshima Peace
Museum several years ago. While the Japanese vividly
and accurately display the horrors of the atom bomb.
there was not a single picture or word about Japanese
atrocities such as Pearl Harbor, the Nanking Massacre or
the Bataan Death March. And this is why many
Japanese continue to see themselves as victims of the
war.

Under pressure from veterans’ groups, the
Smithsonian has added a section to its exhibit which
shows Japanese aggression. However, many veterans’

. groups are still waiting to see the entire exhibit before

making their final judgment on its accuracy in portray-
ing America’s and Japan’s role in the Pacific War. If the
United States, Japan and the nations of the Pacific are to
come to grips with the Pacific War, and put the events of
the past behind them so that they can move forward.
they must present historically accurate information to
the children of both Japan and the United States so that
the tragedies of the past will not be repeated in the
future.

YRA-
CUSE,
_ N.Y. —
i In some
eyes, Pitt’s
31-7 loss to
Syracuse on
Saturday was

 

as bad a
Columnist thrashing as a
Sean team will
Duncan ever receive.

The game

was so blatantly lopsided sta-
tistically that the Panthers
couldn’t find their team stats if
they searched with a magnify-
ing glass.

In retrospect, however,
things could have been worse.

The Pitt defense stymied the
Orangeman offense for only
618 total yards, as opposed to
Pitt’s attack of 233 yards.
That’s onlyja difference of 385
yards.

Syracuse’s lackluster offen-
sive output ranked third high-
est in its school history, behind
East Carolina and Rutgers. At
least the Panthers are not on
the top of the list, for that
would be devastating.

The Pitt run defense, which
has been under fire by coach
Johnny Majors, gripped SU’s
running game for 415 yards
and limited running back
Kirby Dar Dar and quarter-
back Kevin Mason to career
rushing games. Dar Dar’s 136
yards beat his last week’s
career-high performance
against Virginia Tech by 18
yards

Mason, who has been
labeled an erratic QB, contin-
ued that trend. He only
amassed 351 total yards,
which tied him for fifth on
SU’s single-game record list
with Marvin Graves. Mason
rushed for 147 yards and had
two rushing touchdowns,
which were both career
records for him.

Another bright spot for Pitt
was that they refused to be
shut out. Notorious for having
offensive problems, especially
against a swarming defense
like Syracuse’s —— dead last in
the Big East in totaldefense
(433.4 yards per game
allowed) — the Panthers ral-
lied for seven points. Pitt’s 80-
yard scoring drive culminated
with Billy West’s 3—yard
touchdown scamper with 4:26
left in the game.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. — The
Pitt Panthers were never in the
driver’s seat on Saturday.

Instead, Syracuse quarterback
Kevin Mason optioned for the
wheel and drove the Orangemen
right over the Panthers, 31-7, in
front of 47,622
witnesses at the
Carrier Dome. ~

“They hit us
inside, they hit us
outside, they hit us
passing, they hit
us everywhere,”
Pitt head coach Johnny Majors
said of the rout.

Syracuse piled up 618 yards,
414 rushing, in taking it to the
Pitt defense. Twenty—four of the
Orangemen’s 90 offensive plays
went for 10 yards or more.

Mason handled Syracuse’s
option offense perfectly, oft

“Their option scheme is very,
very good,” Majors said. “It
takes tremendous discipline and
real good speed to defend, but
their speed was dominating,
much more so than what ours
was.”

Neither team pushed the
accelerator in a feeling out first
quarter. They exchanged punts
until Syracuse got close enough
to miss a 33-yard field goal.

But the Syracuse offense put
the pedal to the turf in their
peeling out 17-point second
quarter.

The Orangemen drove 91
yards on 14 plays on their way
to their first score, a pitch from
Mason to Dar Dar, who popped
to the outside and scampered 14
yards into the end zone. The

Soccer shut out in crucial Big East contest

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

Midway through the second
half, Pitt trailed Seton Hall 1-0.
A high, almost floating, ball
arched directly across the goal
crease. Panther midfielder John
Lopus leaped high above a
defender and cracked a_ perfect

header over the sprawling
Pirate goalie toward a seem-
ingly open net.

At the last second, however,
a defender stepped in and
headed the ball out the net. As
the ball bounded harmlessly
away, so did Pitt’s chances for
victory. Seton Hall would add
another goal a few minutes

later as the Panthers were
shutout by the Pirates 2-0 at
Pitt Stadium Saturday.

It was a particularly stinging

defeat for Pitt (6-5), which had‘

won three of four and was
coming off a 7-0 thrashing of
St. Francis Saturday night.

The word “letdown” was
never mentioned as a charac-

teristic of play Saturday. The
Panthers found themselves in a
tight game and simply could
not convert when the opportu-
nity arose.

Pitt missed a good chance to
get on the scoreboard in the
first few minutes of the game.

Pitt stakes superiority i nfrence

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

For the ﬁrst time all season the
Pitt volleyball team has taken
over the role as the top team in
the Big East, a role Pitt has
proudly held for the past six
years.

Going into this weekend, the
Lady Panthers were ranked third
in the Big East. However, after
taking care of conference foes
Providence (12-4 overall, 0-2 Big
East) and Seton Hall (18-3, 2-1),
they are back on top and as confi-
dent as they have been all season.

“We know now that if we play
at our level, we are just going to
beat everyone else on our sched-
ule, ‘and I think that is going to be
the goal,” Pitt assistant coach
Brian Begor said. “I just give all
the credit to the team. They took
it upon themselves to play
relaxed. and they got the job
done.”

Pitt (10-6, 3-0) played visiting
Providence on Friday night and
quickly disposed of the Friars in
three straight games. The Lady
Panthers won 15-9. 15-12. and
15-8. to raise themselves into a
first-place tie with Seton Hall.
who they would meet in less than
24 hours.

Coming into Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse on Saturday night, the
Pirates had been the team to beat
in the Big East this year, and Pitt
did just that. Pitt won the match
in four sets,15-13, 17-19, 15-4,
and 15-5.

“We just played great volley-
ball,” Begor said. “Providence is
a good team, and we just blew
them out of the gym. Seton Hall
is athletic as any team we’ve
played other than Stanford or
Nebraska, and other than a battle
in the second game, they were
really never in the match. We just
completely outplayed them.”

Junior outside and middle hitter
Sarah Mikla had a solid weekend.
Friday against Providence, Mikla
had 15 kills and a .444 hitting
percentage, plus 14 digs and 6

’ block assists. She followed with

an equally impressive match on
Saturday night with 16 kills and
13 digs.

“Sarah Mikla has arrived as a
player,” Begor said. “She has
really struggled all year long, and
it was tough for her because she
is one of the hardest working kids
I have ever worked with. She
does everything possible to put
herself in position to perform.
She had some shoulder soreness

Mason strikes Heisman pose against Panthers

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

SYRACUSE, N.Y.
Syracuse quarterback Kevin
Mason did everything but
pose for the Heisman in the
Orangemen’s 31-7 rout over
Pitt Saturday at the Carrier
Dome.

But it’s not
like he couldn’t
have.

“We probably
made him look
like a Heisman
Trophy candi-
date the-way we
played today,”
Pitt coach Johnny Majors
said. “We didn’t do much to
stop him, but he’s a wonder-
ful athlete.”

Although Mason’s four pre-
vious games don’t merit a
Heisman watch, his perfor-
mance against Pitt should.
Mason compiled 351 total
yards, which tied him for
fifth on Syracuse’s all-time

 

,list with his predecessor

Marvin Graves. He also ran
for two touchdowns and
threw for another.

Mason’s 147 yards rushing
on 17 carries opened up the
field for the pass, as he com-
pleted l2 of 23 passes for
204 yards, all of which are
career bests for him. His
rushing total surpassed his
season total of 101 yards, and
he passed for 65 more yards
than his average.

“Kevin Mason, I am certain
that he had his best effort of
his career,” Syracuse head
coach Paul Pasqualoni said.

The 6—foot-3-inch, fifth-
year senior QB accounted for
18 of Syracuse’s points. With
4:33 left in the second quar-
ter, Mason struck for a 12-
yard touchdown run on an
option keeper. Then in the
third quarter he hit running
back Kirby Dar Dar for a 5-
yard touchdown strike.
Mason drove the final stake

in Pitt’s heart on a 2-yard TD
scamper. Mason’s success
was mostly due to his effec-
tiveness to run Syracuse’s
trademark option offense.
Baffled by Mason’s poise.
Pitt didn’t know whether he
was going to pitch the ball or
keep it himself.

“I love the option game as
a coach.” Majors said. “If
you got a quarterback that
can move the ball, it adds a
special dimension that opens
up the whole offense, particu-

_ larly if he can throw.”

Mason did all of that
against Pitt. But all of his
games this year weren’t gold-
en. In his first game of the
year against Oklahoma,
Mason completed a lowly
two of 11 passes in the first
half and constantly misread
the defense, which caused a
nose—to-nose confrontation
with Pasqualoni, who loudly
offered some advice. '

S'econd—leading scorer in the
Big East, broke free on a
breakaway but was turned
away on a tremendous save by
Pirate goalie Eric Shaw.

“Usually I just settle the ball,
bring it to the turf and slide it
by the keeper,” Prex said. “I
just volleyed it. It was a bad
decision.”

From Prex’s description of
the play, you get the feeling
that nine out of 10 times he
would have easily beaten
Shaw. It was that kind of after-
noon for Pitt.

Neither team was able to get
its offense on track. Shaw only
had to make four saves, and
Panther keeper Kirk Brodows
only faced six shots total.

The difference was that
Seton Hall took advantage of
crucial moments and Pitt

 

* didn’t. or

‘-5_?;..'.!,;’

“I thought that in the first
half we played well,” coach
Joe Luxbacher said. “We made
one mistake, and they got a
breakaway and scored.”

The breakaway, which was
really all that Seton Hall would
need on the afternoon, was
scored by midfielder Torn
Houston. Houston outran the
Panther defense down the right
side and beat a sprawling

Brodows on a well-placed shot

to the upper right comer.

The second and final goal of
the contest was scored after the
headerby Lopus. A foul was
called on Pitt defender Brett
Stezoski near the Panther net
which resulted in a free kick 10
feet out from the left side. The
Pirates’ Steve Whelan scooted
the ball in front of the net, and
Steve McKee buried a well-

Both times that Seton Hall

scored, Brodows was left out to
dry. .« ‘
“They just played it right
across the crease on the second
goal,” Brodows said. “The guy
was wide open. There was real-
ly nothing that I could do. The
breakaway was generally the
same thing.”

“Kirk did a good job,”
Luxbacher said. “The goals
weren’t his fault. The break-
away, he tried to play it, and
the free kick, they got a guy
near post and that was it.”

The defeat left Pitt at 1-4 in
the Big East with only four
conference games remaining.

“This was a game that we
really needed,” Brodows said.
“It’s gonna be tough to make
the playoffs. Other teams are
going to lose and things are

going to have to fall into place
in order for us to get to where
we want.” _, , .~ . .‘_

Pitt has a much needed week
off before it faces Connecticut
in a crucial game Friday night.

“We’re not out of it yet,”
Luxbacher said.

“We just got to get ready for
UConn. They are very big and
physical as compared to Seton
Hall who is very skilled. I think
that they are on a six or seven
game winning streak. We're
just going to have to step it
up.”

So, it can be said that the
season is on the brink Friday
night. A win will keep the faint
postseason hopes alive, and a
loss may have people looking
toward next year.

“We just have to respond,”
Prex said. “We just can’t lose
any more games.”

she wasn’t able to kill the ball, and
that really affects your conﬁdence.
and as -she has gotten healthier she
has started driving through the
ball and killing the ball for us. She
just had a really solid weekend
and played great volleyball.”

Pitt has been erratic all year
long, and at no time had it been
more obvious then after Tuesday
night’s loss to Akron. It is a loss
the team may look back on later in
the year as the turning point of the
season if it can continue this
weekend’s success.

“I think you are going to see
this team take off,” Begor said. ‘‘I
think they were wondering for a
long time if they were any good,
and I think they found out that
they are and are excited to get
after it.

“After that Akron match we
didn’t know where we were going
to go from there. We hoped we
would play good and we felt we
could, but when you play a match
like that you will either use it as a
springboard to motivate you or
you will just put your tail between
your legs and run away.”

Much of the Lady Panthers’ up
and down play has been due to the
fact that they have not been able
to dictate their style of play.

“We kind of had a theme for the
weekend and that was to get into a
rhythm and play relaxed.” Begor
said. “We are not the kind of team
that has to be emotional. We are
really a ball control team and real-
ly in a lot of ways a finesse team,
and if you are over-emotional it is
really hard to ball control and do
those things. You really need to be
relaxed to play the way we do.

“Seton Hall is a physical team.
a team that terminates the ball a
lot, and we just felt that if we were
emotional we would play into
their hands. We made a commit-
ment to play a long match and be
relaxed and balanced, and that is
exactly what happened.”

The team definitely gained
some confidence this weekend
and seems to have found its iden-
tity.

“We are the kind of team that
doesn’t have to have anybody play
great. We don’t expect that kind of
performance from anybody, we

just ask that everybody play a role
and as a team be balanced. I think
we are the kind of team that wears
other teams out. We just keep the
ball coming up and siding'out and
we wait for opportunities and we
take them. I think we are kind of a
team of attrition,” _

“We played with poise, and we

“That is the thing we haven’t done
this year. No magic words were
spoken. we didn’t put a spell on
anybody in the locker room. or

°From page 10

drive was fueled by a pair of
second-and-long, 19-yard com-
pletions. The first was a strike
from Mason, who was hit while
throwing off his back foot, to
receiver Will Walker, which
ignited a previously stagnant
Syracuse homecoming crowd.

One Pitt three-and-out series,
and the Orangemen were
revving their offensive machine
once again.

Starting at their own 25,
Mason completed a 19-yard
pass to wideout Deon Maddox
and followed that with a 16-
yard keeper two plays later.
Already at the Pitt 35, Mason
hit his» favorite target, receiver
Marvin Harrison, on a quick
slant good for 20 yards down to
the Pitt 15. Harrison would fin-
ish with five clutch catches for
107 yards.

Two plays later, Mason raced
untouched around right end for
12 yards and a Syracuse touch-
down.

“It seemed like we played the
option well,” Pitt defensive line-
man Tyler Young said. “We
strung it out well, but [Mason]
cut back a lot and it seemed like
that’s where a lot of his yards
came from.”

Down 14-0, John Ryan
replaced an injured Sean
Fitzgerald at quarterback for the
Panthers. Majors said Fitzgerald
re-aggravated a foot sprain. I

“I know if I would have
stayed out there I would have
just hurt the team,” Fitzgerald
said.

After his first play, it looked
as if Ryan may have finally had
Pitt moving in the right direc-
tion. His 33-yard completion to
receiver Curtis Anderson moved
Pitt across midfield to the
Syracuse 47.

But Orangeman defensive
tackle Wilky Bazile detoured
the Pitt attack, sacking Ryan
three plays later on a third-and-
eight for a loss of 10.

“We had no semblance of
offensive continuity or regulari-
ty whatsoever,” Majors said.

Following the Pitt punt,
Syracuse began its third scoring
drive of the quarter at its 27
with 2:25 left in the half.

A 21-yard completion from
Mason to Harrison on the
drive’s second play quickly had
the Orangemen across midfield.
Six plays later on first-and-20,
Mason kept the ball on a busted
hand-off attempt to Dar Dar. He
squirted past center, jumped to
the outside, and was 28 yards
downfield to the Pitt seven
before being pushed out of
bounds by Pitt cornerback
Denorse Mosley.

On the next play, with just :14
left in the half, Mason tried to
hit Harrison crossing in the end
zone, but overthrew him.
Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni
opted for the field goal. It was
good. and the Orangemen had a
commanding 17-0 halftime lead.

The Orangemen put it on
cruise control in the second half.

After missing a field goal on
their first drive, a 13-play effort,
Syracuse took a Pittfpunt and
drove 81 yards in 14 plays on its

second possession of the half.

The drive culminated with
Dar Dar’s second touchdown,
when on third-and-goal from the
Pitt five, Mason lofted a pass
over linebacker Gerald Simpson
to the backpedalling Dar Dar,
who jumped up and made the
catch in the back corner of the
end zone.

Up 24-0, Syracuse started its
last scoring drive at the begin-
ning of the fourth quarter, fol-
lowing Pitt’s seventh punt.
Highlighted by a 27-yard com-
pletion from Mason to Harrison,
a 15-yard facemask call against
Pitt linebacker Hayes Clark and
some grinding Dar Dar running,
the drive covered 88 yards on
nine plays.

Mason capped the drive with
a 2-yard keeper around right
end for his second touchdown.

Down 31-0 and having taken
a back seat to the Syracuse
offense the entire game, the Pitt
offense finally put together a
drive, albeit in garbage time.

The Panthers went 80 yards in
11 plays behind some pretty
nifty passing from Ryan, who
was 5-for-5 on the drive for 58
yards. Tailback Billy West
plowed three yards across the
goal line for the only Pitt score.

“I’d love to have a team as
good as they were today,”
Majors said of the Orangemen.
“It’d be a lot of fun.”

Kind of like a nice and easy
Saturday drive through upstate
New York.

“We need to see the last quar-
ter on film,” Syracuse head
coach Paul Pasqualoni said.
“We’re not going to be too
happy with it.”

Come on coach, it was your
second-string.

Besides proving that SU’s
second-string is a complete fail-
ure, the Panthers did dominate
one offensive category. Punter
Nate Cochran humiliated SU’s
punter Sean Reali. Cochran’s
punts rained with frequency
and fury. He punted seven
times for an average of 41 .7
yards (292 total yards) and a
long of 60, opposed to Reali,
who squibbed one measly punt
for 35 yards.

There were some other
notable positives for the
Panthers. Pitt didn’t have any
turnovers. The Panther air
attack improved when backup
QB John Ryan checked in the
game for bruised Sean
Fitzgerald. Ryan completed
nine of 12 passes for 125 yards.
Conversely, Fitzgerald was
three-for- seven for 20 yards.
Linebacker Jason Chavis led
the game in tackles with 16, ll
of which were unassisted.
Finally, at least the loss didn’t
come against Temple.

Pitt’s loss just proves that no
matter what happens, you can
always find solace in every-
thing you do. 2

As a result, Syracuse is last
in the Big East in passing
offense. Conversely, Mason
leads the conference in pass-
ing efficiency with a .570
percentage. That’s the thing,
Mason has been labeled as
an inconsistent quarterback.

Mason avoided the rush, sat
in the pocket and executed
the option like a seasoned
veteran. Kind of like his
mentor Graves, whom Mason
sat behind for three years
and learned.

“I think if he was anywhere
else in the country in a differ-

better player,” he said. “I just
have to make the best out of
my opportunity.”

Mason’s steady improve-
