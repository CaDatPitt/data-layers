SGB wants
increase in
minority

 retention

By William Young

News Editor

Retention of minority students,
especially blacks, is one of the
main problems the Student
Government Board is going to
tackle in the upcoming fall term.

According to SGB president
Craig Jackson, retention of black
students at Pitt does not remain

constant with the level of black

students who enroll each year.
Some of the factors that cause
black students to leave the
university are money, grades and
atmosphere.

”First we've got to try and get
the racial aspect taken out,” said
Jackson. "We want to try and
make everyone feel more com-
fortable on campus, especially
the blacks with the whites and
the whites with the blacks."

”We want to get a dialogue
together,” said Melanie Berg, a
former SGB member. ”A black
and white thing.”

One of the things to be done
differently this upcoming year
will be with the Black Action So-
ciety sponsoring Get Acquainted
Weekend. Rather than billing it as
a BAS function, Jackson wants to
include the SGB in the function
to eliminate the conception that
it is geared specifically towards
black students.

”We are going to try and bill
it asthe ’picnic on the lawn’ as
a Black Action Society-Student
Government thing,” said Jackson.

One of the main problems
Jackson faces is getting white stu-
dents to go to BAS sponsored
events. The problem, as he sees
it, is that white students feel that
BAS events are only for blacks.

”We’re going to try and start
making people feel that the Black
Action Society isn't just for
blacks,’’ Jackson said. ”We want
to start people going to the meet-
ings and to the programs so that
we can get a cross-over going.

’’If we can get them [blacks and
whites] talking, get them used to
seeing each other on campus and
talking, that's the first step,” Jack-
son said. ”|t’s going to be tough.
It's not going to be an easy thing
to try to get rid of'the racial
problems.”

Another goal the SGB has set

. for the fall term is the installation

of computer terminals in Hillman
Library. The terminals would be
solely for word-processing oper-
ations, the intent being to free ter-

Massey to keep up the good work

By Scot Ross

Assistant News Editor

Dr. Gerald J. Massey, newly
appointed director of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh's Center for the
Philosophy of Science, said he is
satisfied with the department's
operation and plans no major
changes.

Massey is filling the vacancy
created by Dr. Nicholas Resch-
er's resignation.

Massey, the Center's present
associate director for academic
programs, will assume the posi-
tion July 1, while Rescher will be-
come vice-chairman of the
Center.

..Ma.ssey was selected by the

officers of the Center, founder
and chairman Dr. Adolph Grun-
baum and former director
Rescher. '

”My first objective is to main-
tain the quality of the Center and,
where possible, even advance
it,” said Massey.

’’I’m delighted about it and
confident [Massey] will do a su-
perb job,” Rescher said. ”The
university "is fortunate to have
such an able person.” ‘

He added that Massey is ”a'

good administrator, capable
philosopher and an enthusiastic
practitioner.”

Rescher said of his own depar-

Jture, ”l've done it for seven years,

and I wanted to find time for a
major writing project I've got.”

The new director's credentials
include extensive work in logic,
scientific methodology, the
philosophy of language and the
history of philosophy.

He was educated at Notre
Dame and received his Ph.D. at
Princeton.

Massey arrived at Pitt in 1970,
holding the position of chairman
of the department of philosophy
for seven years. He also acted as
associate dean of the faculty of
arts and sciences.

challenge of the job. The center

NSN plans

NYC march
to protest
nukes

By Mindy Boffemmyer

Assistant News Editor

As the United Nations begins
its third special session on
nuclear disarmament, members
of Pitt's New Student Network
will join thousands of people
from the U.S. and other countries
to protest nuclear weapons and
U.S. military intervention in for-
eign nations.

According to NSN President
Angie Hirsh, five years ago, when
the U.N. held its last disarma-
ment session, nearly a million
people participated in a demon-
stration against nuclear arms.

The demonstration, scheduled
to take place in New York City on
Saturday, will include a march to
Central Park. Another protest will
take place simultaneously in San
Francisco.

’’I think when people first
heard about the demonstration,
they tended to think we just had
a vague opposition to nuclear
weapons. Actually, our main fo-
cus is economics. Three million
people in this country don't have
a place to live or food to eat, and
our government is spending bil-
lions of dollars on weapons,”
Hirsh said.

Peter Shell, a CMU student _

who is also involved in the
demonstration, said that one of its
most important objectives is so-
cial justice.

The NSN is also working on
the Sister City Project. Through
this project, Pittsburghers send
humanitarian aid to their ”adopt-
ed” Nicaraguan city, San Icidro.

”Since the Reagan policy was
unacceptable, we decided to be-
gin a sort of local foreign policy
of our own,” said Todd May, a
Penn State student and a local or-
ganizer of the Sister City Project.

The mayor of San lcidro, Louis
Antonio Martinez, recently visit-
ed Pittsburgh and met with peo-
ple across the city, including the
NSN. ‘

According to Shell, CMU stu-
dents used money donated by
Noam Chomska, a linguist and
political writer, to provide school
supplies for elementary school
students in San Icidro. Chomska
recieved the money through a
CMU honorarium when he
spoke at the university. _

Hirsch said the NSN will dis-
cuss and plan a demonstration
against an execution to take place
June 14 atgtheir next meeting.

Dukakis, Bush seek party unity and running mates

WASHINGTON (AP) —
Primaries behind them, Michael
Dukakis and George Bush now
turn to unifying their parties and
picking running mates, chores
that are complicated for Dukakis
by the persistent claims of Jesse
Jackson.

Party unity is a big theme this
week for the likely general elec-
tion opponents as both Dukakis
and Bush reach out to their van-
quished opponents.

In the closing hours of the cam-
paigning for Tuesday's primaries
in California, Montana, New Jer-
sey and New Mexico, Jackson
also talked of challenges on the
convention floor on such issues
as South Africa. it ,

He gave his most definitive an?
swer yet to the question of
whether he would like to be
Dukakis’ running mate.

Asked about that Tuesday, in
an interview on ABC—TV, Jackson
said of Dukakis, ”If he were to
win, extending the invitation to
me is his option.” He said he did
not know whether he would ac-
cept, but then added, ’’It is an op-
tion my constituency has
earned.”

Saturday, 4,059 were housed in
the city's four prisons.

If a threat to exceed the capac-

unable to imprison any but the
most serious criminals.

Sarah Vandenbraak, an attor-
ney representing the district attor-

the city footing the bill to put dan-
gerous criminals back on the

The city will be barred from ad-

those charged with the most seri-
ous crimes, including murder, at-

Pitt to hold AIDS awareness programs in the fall

By Celeste E. Steffen
For the Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Health Education Department
and several student organizations
are planning to hold extensive
AIDS awareness programs for
next fall in an effort to better edu-
cate students about the deadly
disease.

”Since we started AIDS educa-
tion programs, there has been no
decline in the number of students
we treat each month for sexually
transmitted diseases,” saidjsheryl
Miller of the university's Student
Health Services. ”Obviou§ly, stu-
dents aren't protecting;'them-
selves and aren't taking the threat
of AIDS very seriously.”§

Every month, approxifnately
25-30 students are treated for

chlamydia, according to stlatistics L

Miller has kept since 1986; when
cultures for chlamydia became
routine. ‘-

Approximately 15-20 students
test positive for gonorrhea each
month also. Since the AIDS
awareness programs began,
Miller has not seen any decrease
in the number of positive cultures
for chlamydia or gonorrhea.

”There’s a general attitude
among college students that
things can't happen to them,”
Miller said. ”They think they

can't get pregnant, can't get V.D.
 won't get AIDS. We're trying
to break through to them, but it's
difficult.”

It is believed by some experts
that college students are very vul-
nerable to contracting the AIDS
virus because of their lifestyles.

’’If a person comes in contact
with the virus, recent studies
show that their lifestyle can de-
termine whether or not they'll ac-
tually come down with AIDS,"
said Gary Bonas, director of stu-
dent activities at Villanova
University.

Stress; alcohol, smoking, lack
of rest and drug use all seem to
have an effect on the body's
ability to fight the virus.

”All of those elements are a
part of many college students’
lives,” said Bonas. ”Anyone who
is sleeping around and not pro-
tecting themselves is playing Rus-
sian roulette.”

Since 1982, there have been
53,000 AIDS-related deaths in
the United States. It is believed
that 3 to 4 million people are cur-
rently infected with the virus and
do not know it.

In Allegheny County last year,
73 cases of AIDS were reported.
A total of 166 people have test-
ed positive for the virus since
1981.

”Last year, we had 3 cases of
AIDS involving heterosexuals,”

minals in the computer labs for
use by students who need them
for programming purposes.

Putting terminals in the library
would also allow students doing
papers to be closer to their
sources, which would allow
books to remain in the library and
make them more available to

other students.

The plan calls for the installa-
tion of fifty terminals the first year
and an additonal fifty terminals
the following year. Jackson feels
that placing these computers in
the library would allow more stu-
dents to use computers to type
their papers and would keep
them closer to their source
materials.

”The details of this execution
are not as important as the fact
that a man is being executed,"
Hirsh said. Hirsh said that she is
against the death penalty because
”it has been proven not to be an
effective deterrent. In states

where capital punishment is le-
gal, the crime rate isn't any low-
er than in other states."

People who wish to participate
in the demonstration for nuclear
disarmament may contact the
Thomas Merton Center by calling
361-3022 for information.

said Guillermo Kole of the Al-
legheny County Health Depart-
ment. ”We expect that number to
keep rising.”

As the statistics climb, various
student organizations are begin-
ning to plan programs to warn
students about the threat of AIDS.
The university's fraternities and
sororities are taking large strides
to better inform the entire cam-
pus community.

”An AIDS awareness seminar is
going to be a mandatory part of
rush next year,” said Chuck
Farinella, president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council. ”I want to
bring in some excellent speakers

and make the seminar open to
the entire community, not just to
those inovlved in the Greek
system.”

Farinella has attended pro-
grams and seminars concerning
AIDS and believes AIDS educa-
tion should be top priority next
yeah

’’I have the support of most of
the fraternities and sororities to
make AIDS awareness part of
rush,” said Farinella. ”A few
fraternities are also‘ planning to
install condom machines in their
houses as well. I feel students are
finally going to realize the threat
AIDS poses to the college com-

munity.”

Farinella hopes to include the
entire community and other stu-
dent groups in the Creek's AIDS
programs through posters and
contact with the leaders of vari-
ous student organizations.

”By making an AIDS program
a mandatory part of rush, I want
to reach more than just pledges
from the various fraternities and
sororities,” said Farinella. ’’AIDS
is everybody’s problem. I know
no one really wants to sit and
listen to a bunch of bad news, but
people have to. College students
have to realize now the threat
AIDS really is to all of us.”

Exercise stimulates woman

Q: After four years of sex with
my boyfriend, I am not sure that
I have ever had an orgasm with
him. I know that lots of women
don't know what an orgasm is
like and are wondering if they
ever had one and sort of missed
it. But in my case, it does sound
weird because I have had some
sensations that I am pretty sure
must be orgasmic. -

Only not from sex with my
boyfriend or from stimulating my-
self. I had them doing exercises.
In particular, doing leg lifts seems
to do it for me. Is that my sexual
future? Is it possible to have or-
gasms that way and not from sex?

And can a woman enjoy 

without having orgasms?
A: Women definitely can have
orgasms from vigorously perform-

DR. RIl'I'I'I

\NES'I'I-IEIMER A

ing certain exercises. And not just
from the classic way, which is
during the rope-climb in gym.
Doing the leg lift is a perfectly
plausible way since it involves
strenuously tightning the right
muscles.

Of course there is pleasure in
sharing sex apart from reaching
orgasm — but it is better to be
able to decide for yourself
whether to have an orgasm or
not, and to have the option for
having one. I think you should
get a copy of Lonnie Barbach’s
book, ”For Yourself,” and learn

how to reach orgasm, and then
use that ability when you want
during shared sex.

Mentioning Dr. Barbach’s book
reminds me of a woman who
said in my presence, very recent-
ly, that she couldn't ask for a sex
book in a store because it would
be so embarassing, 

Q: I have my eye on a guy. Be-
fore I do anything, what do you
think about girls asking guys out
on dates?

A: I think it's a great idea, I'm
all for it, but you have to be ready
for the turndown in case it comes
— the same as a guy has to be
ready for it when he asks you out
on a date. As a matter of cunning,
I think you should not ask him to
take part in a full—scale dating
event the first time.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June 8, W88

By Mark R. Brown
AP Wire Editor

John Heinz, Pennsylvania's
senior Senator, recently called
for a restructuring of NATO in
an address to a luncheon au-
dience in the William Penn
Hotel's Grand Ballroom, spon-
sored by the World Affairs
Council._

Senator Heinz spoke on
Western security and U.S. pri-
orities for the 19905.

”Senate ratification of the
INF treaty is history,” said
Heinz. ”The Truman Doctrine
assumed that the U.S. would
bear the brunt of defense of
the West. The Marshall plan
rebuilt Europe, and NATO
was created when America
was holding two-thirds of the
world's gold and our GNP was
60 percent of the non-
communist world. Today, we
have a different economic and
strategic reality."

Heinz said that the INF
treaty has caused the Senate to
re—examine NATO strategy
without Pershing and Cruise
missiles in the allied arsenals.
According to Heinz, ”A fun-
damental issue that must -be
addressed is burden sharing in
NATO defense.

 

Sen. Heinz wants a
restructured NATO

ment would mean a neutralist
Europe in a domino effect with
the end of NATO. That might
be the case only if the with-
drawal was unilateral and sud-
den, without a commitment
by Europe,” said Heinz, who
was a member of the Helsinki
Commission. The Helsinki
Commission was charged with
oversight of the international
treaty establishing basic hu-
man rights in Europe.

Heinz stated that the United
States should remain strong in
commitment to defense, as
evidenced by situations in the
past in Libya, Afghanistan and
the Persian Gulf.

”We need to start a cooper-
ative restructuring of NATO. It
can only begin with a U.S.
president who is firm in reduc-
tion of cost in Europe, along
with a commitment from our
allies,” said Heinz, who point-
ed out to the audience that the
United States spends seven
percent of its GNP on NATO
defense, whereas European

countries each spend three

percent. A
”We have five divisions in
Europe, and five stateside for
backup, which is ten out of
our 16 divisions. That costs us
over $100 billion a year; some

Underage drinking

C0m€5 IMO f0CUS They know not what they say

It would appear that the days of Fitzgeraldesque drunken
revelries on thecampuses of Pennsylvania's institutions of
higher learning are coming to a close. On July I, a new under-
age drinking law will go into effect.

Under the new statute, which provides a $1,000 fine for any-
one providing an alcoholic beverage for a minor, fraternity and
sorority members may find themselves responsible for the ac-
tions of underage members and guests.

As a result of the new law, Greek organizations are between
the proverbial rock and a hard place. It is no secret that in the
past, drinking has been a large part of, some go as far as to
say motivation for, the fraternity and sorority experience. We've
all seen movies of the Animal House variety, depicting Greek
life as little more than a long party broken by short, intense
intervals of cramming.

However, the raid last year on the fraternity at Carnegie Mel-
Ion University that resulted in more than 100 students’ being
detained by police officers clearly shows that local law enforce-
ment officials have increasingly less tolerance for the sowing
of wild-oats on college campuses.

To their credit, members of various Greek organizations on
campus are working to sponsor an alcohol awareness program
for the fall. Education is certainly a useful tool, both for the bet-
terment of a community and the for the enhancement of an
admittedly tarnished image. If the motivation for sponsoring
the program is to decrease the frequency of underage drinking
on campus, it may prove to be of little value. As Michelle Jed-
lica, Panhel president, said, ”We don't want to tell people what
to do; we'd only like to try to guide them."

Repeatedly, the fraternities and sororities have expressed an
interest in policing themselves. Now that the responsibility for
underage drinking is falling increasingly on the shoulders of
the officers of campus groups, it seems that self-discipline in
those organizations will have to mean more than an alcohol
awareness seminar. .

To act as a guiding influence, perhaps it would be reasona-
ble for the fraternities and sororities to begin carding guests at
their parties. Or, parties open to underage guests could, con-
ceivably, be alcohol-free.

All of which is not to say, however, that the new law is a
good one. It includes a provision to take the driving privileges
of a minor caught drinking, even if the offence had nothing
to do with an automobile. Such a move seems to have serious
implications in terms of civil rights.

The law, though, regardless of any opinion one might have
of it, still remains on the books. Either the greek organizations
will have to eliminate underage drinking from their buildings
or the police, with the gracious assistance of Kevin Mellot, will
do it for them.

Enough said.

In a nutshell...

”Beware the temptation of pride ... to ignore the facts
of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire,
to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and
thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right
and wrong and good and evil.

—— Ronald Reagan

I'm an atheist. I don't believe
in God. V

For a lot of people, the almost
automatic response to the above
declaration would be something
like; ”Why? What justification do
you have for your atheism? Can
you prove God doesn't exist?”

But this is an invalid response.
Atheism is not a positive
philosophical position -— it is the
absence of one. In saying that I'm
an atheist, I'm saying that I don't
posess a belief in God (or in
Gods). I'm not saying anything
about what I do believe in. And
where no belief is asserted, no
justification is required or possi-
ble. There is nothing to justify.

It is the theist who is asserting
a positive belief — so the burden
of proof is on him. The theist
must face the responsibility of
providing a coherent description
of what he means by ”God” and
proving that his God exists.

In an attempt to escape this
responsibility, many theists state:
”God is so great, He cannot be
grasped by the human mind." As-
suming that the theist who says
this is a human being, this theist
is admitting that he doesn't know
the meaning of a word he is us-
ing, that he literally doesn't know
what he's talking about.

Many theists provide some

BRIAN
SAMENT

meaning for the usage of ”God,”
and then one must actively find
the contradiction. For example,
”God is the creator of the
universe.” The universe is the to-
tal of that which exists. In order
for something to take any action,
including ”creating the
universe," it must exist — but
then it is a part of the universe.
The fact is that the universe as a
whole simply does not require a
causal explanation. Causality
presupposes existence —— not the
other way around.

The theist must either ”define”
God outside the bounds of hu-
man understanding — and thus
evict himself from the realm of
language and thought, or he must
rewrite the nature of reality in
order to make room for God -
and thus evict himself from the
realm of rationality. As I obvious-
ly cannot examine every theistic
argument presented here, I would
suggest that those interested read
the arguments of some of the best
and most intellectual theologians,
such as St. Anselm and Thomas
Aquinas, and you will be able to

verify this for yourself.

Many theists would reply at this
point that all of the above is ir-
relevant, because they have faith.
Faith is worse than blindness, be-
cause it is the willful refusal to
see; the faithful believe what they
wish to believe, without regard to
evidence or fact.

If this sounds attractive to you,
then realize that the most consis-
tent practitioners of this anti-
rational ideal are psychotics. Psy-
chotics suffer a complete break

between*’their:mental processes "3 ..
..,, ,5 

and reality.‘

It was not the practitioners of
faith who led mankind out of the
primordial cave and into the in-
dustrial civilization that we can
all benefit from. And it is not the
practitioners of reason who fight
against every this-worldly, life-
enhancing value (e.g. self-esteem,
personal achievement, material
wealth, sex, etc.) because these
values do not measure up to al-
legedly superior, supernatural
standards. If we are to survive at

all, let alone achieve any degree

of serenity and happiness, we
must keep our eyes and minds
firmly fixed on this earth, on the
radiant reality that lies before us.

philosophy student.

like a cheesy rock'n’roll song by
a group named The Marvelettes,

The view was terrible, the back
of a large truck hurtling down the

made me think.

What's the point?

Sculpture exhibition awakens artistic debate

Photos by John Wells

Deciding what's art and what's not is just another
part of the artistic process. Earl Edwards, from
Coraopolis, seems to be deciding for himself

whether Another Kind of Growth by Nancy Rubins
qualifies. In the future, the Festival planners hope
to commision three to five artists annually.

Wednesday, June 8, l988

By ‘Susan Washburn

Entertainment Editor

is this garbage for the junkman or the
museum? Figuring out just what all that
stuff is in Point State Park has become a
recent topic of debate. In deciding
whether the pile of old washers and dent-
ed trucks (entitled Another Kind of
Growth) is sculpture or not, those visiting
the Three Rivers Arts Festival are being
forced to think about their art. The con-
troversial sculpture exhibition is part of
this year's Three Rivers Arts Festival and
is entitled Sculpture at the Point.

The exhibition has brought site-specific
sculpture to the Golden Triangle. Sculp-
ture at the Point is a challenge to the Pitts-
burgh community, according to John
Brice, the Executive Director of the Three
Rivers Arts Festival.

”Art is successful when it evokes a
response,” he said. By his own standards,
then, the exhibition must be a success.
Literally hundreds of people can be seen
surrounding the sculptures created in the
park. While onlookers debate whether or
not the object is art, Brice listens en-
thusiastically. ”Art has the intention of
making you consider something — a per-
spective,” he said.

The 1988 sculpture exhibition is the
first step in the Festival's plan to commit
its resources to the annual commission-
ing of major contemporary outdoor pub-
lic works as the centerpiece. Sculpture at
the Point marks the first time in its 29
years of existence that the Three Rivers
Arts Festival has commissioned such a
group of aritsts.

A huge undertaking (a total budget of
$175,000), the exhibition utilized the best
curators in addition to well—known sculp-
tors. The planning committee conscious-
ly decided to go with many artists in order
to generate interest in the project, accord-
ing to Brice.

The works included range from a fan-
ciful house-like structure complete with
French windows to electronic messages
programmed into the ALCOA sign on Mt.
Washington.

Bringing a new kind of industry to Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh is long overdue for
a cultural awakening.

The artistic endeavors of its
citizens have not kept pace with
the technological growth that the
city has experienced. That's why
commmercial dinosaurs like
Springsteen and Pink Floyd sell
out here, while the small galler-
ies and concerts promoting the
newest innovative music and art
struggle for attention. The com-
mercial radio stations don’t help
much by feeding their listeners a
diet of nostalgia and instant
gratification rather than any
thought—provoking content.

However, the war against cul-
tural conservatism has begun,
and one of its most potent
weapons is this summer's Ex-
perimental Music Series. Unfor-
tunately, to most people the term
”experimenta|” connotes the
unknown, something to be avoid-
ed for more familiar surround-
ings. But the adventurous already
know what the timid must yet dis-

cover -’ that all music is accessi-
ble provided one has an open
mind and a willingness to
explore.

The first opportunity for explo-
ration will occur on June 18 at
Squirrel Hill's Wightman School
in a concert titled Part 1: The
Sounds of Industry. The audience
will have a chance to sample the
wide range of styles lurking wi-
thin the genre called ”industrial.”

The story of industrial music
began with the academic ex-
perimentation of composers such
as Stockhausen and Xenakis and
entered its popular stage in the
late seventies with the advent of
pioneering outfits like Cabaret
Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle.
But the saga didn't end there.

New and inexpensive record-
ing technologies enabled the mu-
sicians to produce and release
their own records and cassettes
without having to rely on the
whims of major companies. This
development put more and more

MANNY
THEINER

artists in control of their own
creative destinies, and the explo-
sion of independent sounds and
video is more powerful today
than ever before.

The influence of the worldwide
experimental movement and a
belief in artistic progress is a com-
mon thread among the three
groups particpating inSounds of
Industry. First to take the stage will
be Pittsburgh's own P Children.
Their presentation easily falls wi-
thin the realm of performance art,
as CMU students Michael Parker
and Harold Walls employ syn-
chronized video and other visual
aspects such as oxygen tanks and
piano innards in combination

-with their harsh, grating pieces.

Multimedia overload may occur. ’
VP Children previously per-

formed three times at CMU and
once in Washington, D.C. Last
year's limited edition cassette
PCh1 will shortly be followed by
the release of PCh2, a plexig|ass-
packaged 7-inch containing
remixed versions of their pieces
”Social Life" and ”Slow Blue
Bite” which will be formally
released at the June 18 show.
The next group, Batz Without
Flesh from Delaware, take a
slightly different tack, preferring
to move people's feet to industri-
al dance music. Those who have
visited avant-garde dance floors
and heard the likes of Front 242
and Skinny Puppy may already
enjoy Batz. If not, imagining a
deadly, gruff voice over pound-
ing beats and throbbing electron-
ics might give the novice an idea
of what he or she is walking into.
At least that's what their new
eponymous record sounds like.
Batz member Claude Willey
describes their purpose as ”e|c—
tronic masturbation - sonic ar-

chitecture - psychological
torture.” A fair amount of signal
processing and tape manipula-
tion is used as well, adding up to
a disturbing yet enlightening ons-
laught for the senses.

Finally, the room will be filled
with a wall of inescapable noise,
an apocalyptic horror that unfurls
its sonic tendrils under the
moniker of IDF - Industrial Domi-
nation Faktion from Cincinnati.
Likened to the crunch and moan

of the Swans, the members of IDF ‘

reach beyond the grave for a
more diversified sound.

IDF is only a subdivision of
Atavistic, one of the most promis-
ing independent conglomerates
promoting experimental music.
Atavistic Video releases have in-
cluded live concerts from such
underground legends as Sonic
Youth, Live Skull and Savage
Republic, while founder Kurt Kel-

.lison released a solo album of in-

triguing treatments for guitar, bass

.,Untaming

the Bard

By Patricia Lomando White
Staff Writer

If you've never seen
Shakespeare performed on stage
A-gnd you're a little timid at the
prospect, a bright and fast-
moving Taming of the Shrew, this
year’s opening play at the Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival, just
could be for you.

Under W. Stephen Coleman's
direction there are pratfalls, slap-
stick and humor reminiscent of
vaudeville beginning with the
opening scene and ending with
the final curtain.

Coleman cleverly uses the in-
duction of Christopher Sly (Alex
Coleman), the drunken tinker

~%‘—who’s made a fool of under the

Lord of Wincot’s (Don Wad-
sworth) direction, to open the
play. His inventiveness is espe-
cially apparent with Sly’s appear-
ance in the closing scene.

But as the play within the play
begins, the action centers on the
question Katherina (Mary Robb
Jackson) must ask herself — ”to
be tame or not to be?" Yet there
is also Bianca's (Maria Barney)
dilemma — even though she has
many suitors, she must writ to
marry until her shrewish older sis-
ter has found a husband.
Bianca's happiness?

While it's obvious that Kate
and Petruchio have fallen for one

Tim Hartman is Grumio in The Taming of the Shrew.

another, it is certain that neither
will willingly succumb to their
feelings, setting the stage for the
battle.

While there is frivolity, there is
also an underlying seriousness.
The battle that rages between
Kate and Petruchio is an outward
sign of the battle that rages within
Kate. While touted as a play
about the ’’battle of the sexes,”
the story is also replete with si-

bling rivalry. This is clear as Kate
furiously thrashes about the stage
and at her sister, upset at the at-
tention given Bianca by their
father.

The cast works exceptionally
well together as they bring

character and ‘life to this already :
substantive work. Coleman is an 4
excellent Petruchio whose matu-
rity makes him a capable shrew-gr
tamer. The pretty Jackson aptly
gives us a Kate who is feisty, an-
gry and demure.

Other standouts in the produc-
tion include Wadsworth as a
strong and commanding Tranio
and Barney as a spoiled and pitia-
ble Bianca.

This fanciful production is filled I
with plenty of energy and humor,
holding the audience and keep-
ing them laughing throughout-,
almost the entire three hours. So, -
if you've never been, this Taming
‘of the Shrew is a great intro-
duction to classical theater.

Industrial

Meanwhile, Kellison’s group
has also been busy producing the
Convulsion record and then the
recent Carcass Party.Their perfor-
mances also include the use of
video projection, but IDF con-
tinues to improve musically and
are now planted firmly in the top

echelon of American industrial
groups.

An evening of experimental
music like this could not occur in
a local club, where the owners
want their patrons to dance hap-
pily in a sea of alcohol. Nor could
it occur in a concert hall, where
tuxedoed trustees would prefer
not to rattle theirichandeliers.

Celtics: Is it the end or just beginning?

If it is true that history always
repeats itself, then the National
Basketball Association should
take advantage of the time that
has been delivered to it through
the hard work of the Detroit
Pistons.

The Motown menaces defeat-
ed the Celtics four games to two
in the Eastern Conference Finals,
becoming the first team to
dethrone the Celtics prior to the
NBA Final since the Philadelphia
76ers in 1983.

But before the league rejoices
in the onrush of the NBA’s new-
found parity, one thing should be
brought to mind: the Celtics will
be back.

Not that anyone is taking them

lightly next year, of course. Larry

Bird, Kevin McHa|e, Robert Par-
ish, Dennis Johnson and Danny
Ainge are perhaps the premiere
starting quintet in the land, pos-
sibly one of the greatest starting
fives of all time. As long as any
number of those players, as old
as they may be, continue to
produce for Boston, as they un-
doubtedly will, the Celtics will
still be the most feared team in
the NBA.

But the one thing that will be
missing from Boston's famed par-
quet floor is the ingredient that
has made the Celtics one of the
greatest sports franchises of all
time — the Boston mystique.

By losing three home games in
the 1988 NBA playoffs — one to

MATT
MARTIN

the Atlanta Hawks and two to the
Pistons — the Celtics also lost the
the home-court advantage they
have had for so many years.

Pardon the cliche, but although
any team can win on any given
night, the Celtics had a supreme
psychological edge over their
peers when games, especially all-
important playoff games, were
played in the Boston Garden.
Opposing teams just knew that
somehow the Celtics would win
even the most seemingly out-of-
range game.

But with the aging of the
Boston starters and the incompe-
tence of their bench, the magic
the Celtics were once capable of
working is now nothing but a
memory. .

Memories, however, may be
the most important weapon the
Celtics have in their arsenal right

now. It wasn't so long ago that.

Boston was at the bottom of the
Atlantic Division of the NBA’s
Eastern Conference.

But through a series of trades
and draft choices by ”Red” Auer-
bach, the Celtics rose to the up-
per echelon of the NBA, once
again attaining the mystique that
has dominated the franchise
since the days of Bill Russell, Bob
Cousy and John Havlicek.

And as long as Auerbach is still
the main man in Boston, you can
bet the house that the North will
rise again.

A few years of mediocrity may
be just what the doctor ordered
for the ailing Celtics. The more

losses they rack up, the highergg

their draft choices become. Bet-
ter players make for a better team,
and the Celtics have always been
known for making good players
better.

It will be a long time until a Lar-
ry Bird is once again available in
the draft, but somehow the Cel-
tics will manage to dig deep into
the pot of gold buried under the
Garden floor and rekindle the
spirit that brought them to the
forefront of professional sports.

will direct the 1988 Big East
All-Star basketball team during
its 10-day competitive tour of
Yugoslavia and Italy. The
squad will train in Chestnut
Hill for three days prior to its
June 9 departure for Zagreb,
Yugoslavia, home of the
powerful Cibona club team.

The All—Stars will play seven
games, including three against
the Yugoslavian National
Team, which is expected to
challenge the United States for
the gold medal during the
1988 Olympic Games in
Seoul, South Korea. The Big
East will also face several club
teams in Italy in addition to
games against Cibona.

Since 1980, the Big East has
conducted an annual competi-

team abroad each summer
and then sponsoring a visiting
team in the fall. Last summer,
the Big East toured Australia
before hosting the Canadian

Sportswomen gaining new image

By Rick Warner
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK —— Most parents
believe sports are as important for
their daughters as their sons, ac-
cording to a national study
released Tuesday.

Eighty-seven percent of the par-
ents surveyed said they agreed
that "sports are equally important
for boys and girls."

"It shows the word ‘tomboy’
no longer exists in the athletic
dictionary,” said Dorothy Harris,
education director of the Wom-
en's Sports Foundation, which
commissioned the study.

"Girls who participate in sports
are no longer laughed at and
ridiculed. In fact, it's popular for
girls to play sports. It's the sexy
thing to do.”

However, the study indicates
that girls tend to drop out of
sports as they get older. While 87
percent of those in the 7-to-10
age grouptsaid they participate in

sports, the figure dropped to 75
percent in the 15-to-18 group.

According to the study, the
drop-off is primarily due to in-
terest in other activities and lack
of time, or interest in boys. Many
black girls cited additional rea-
sons for quitting sports, including
transportation problems and in-
adequate funds to pay for equip-
ment and lessons.

Many girls stop participating in
sports during their mid-teens, the
study shows.

”The puberty barrier appears to
exist,” said Harris, a professor of
exercise and sport science at
Penn State University. "When
girls become more interested in
boys, they tend to become less
interested in sports.”

The survey was based on tele-
phone interviews last November
and December with 1,004 par-
ents and 513 of their 7- to-18
year-old daughters. It was co-
sponsored by the Wilson Sport-
ing Goods Co.

Among the findings:

0 Girls whose parents are in-
volved in sports are more likely
to participate themselves.

0 While most parents believe
better health is the best reason for
their daughters to play sports,
girls say the biggest motivator is
"fun.”

0 Girls participating in sports
receive more encouragement
from their mothers than fathers.

Deborah Anderson, executive
director of the Women's Sports
Foundation, said attitudes about
female participation in sports be-
gan to change in 1972 when
Congress passed a law guarantee-
ing women equal educational op-
portunity. The Title IX legislation
sparked a dramatic increase in
girls’ high school teams and col-
lege scholarships for female
athletes.

The foundation, established in
1974, is a non-profit, education-
al organization that encourages
females to participate in sports.

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — The
owner of a downtown book-
store said Tuesday that charg-
ing $10 for a Willie Mays
autograph during a book-
signing session was a mistake.

Robert Haft, president of
Crown Books, said he wasn't
quite sure how the Hall of
Fame outfielder came to be
collecting money while au-
tographing copies of his new
book, ”Say Hey: The Autobi-
ography of Willie Mays.”

”I think what happened is
he had signed about 700
books in our store,” said Haft
of the incident which took
place May 20. ”Some people
apparently came in with base-

wanted him to sign.”

Mays confused over
selling autographs

Mays, when contacted by
the Associated Press, said he
was tired of talking about the
incident and complained that
reports about it didn't seem to
get the story straight.

But in Tuesday's editions of
the New York Post, Mays was
quoted as saying, ”I didn't take
a dime. Everything went to the
bookstore.” _

Mays, 57, said he was work-'
ing for the publisher, Simon &
Schuster, and was there to sign
only books.

”They tell you when the
books run out, you get up and
walk out,” Mays told the Post.
"But when the books ran out,
there were about 50 to 100
people still in line.

”Rather than leave the peo-
ple hanging there, I said, ‘Give
the bookstore $10 and I'll sign

Mays said the store's president

’’All he had to do was tap me

Haft said Crown's policy is not
to pay authors for promotional
appearances and not to charge
for autographs.

a signing where an author

we would not have allowed it.”

Mays didn't take any money

Haft said.

seven months. Former club
general manager and manager
Paul Owens takes over Baumer’s
role. Both assignments are on an
interim basis.

’’It is my intention to fill these
two positions on a permanent ba-
sis as soon as I can find the right
man,” Giles said at a news con-
ference.

The Phillies’ farm system under
Baumer has been under constant
criticism in the media for its ina-
bility to produce players for the
major-league club, which is in
last place in the National League
East.

”We have some work to do to
get the Phillies back into serious
permanent contention, and my
partners and |_just do not feel that
Woody and Jim are the right peo-
ple to lead the way,” Giles said.

Woodward .joined the Phillies
Oct. 28, 1987, one week after
resigning as vice president and
general manager of the New York
Yankees.

At the time, Giles listed Wood-
ward"s duties as recommending
and negotiating player trades,
evaluating minor-league players,
analyzing major-league person-
nel and gathering information on
every other player in major-
league baseball.

Woodward made three trades
for the Phillies. He traded out-
fielder Glenn Wilson to Seattle
for outfielder Phil Bradley; sent
utility infielder Rick Schu and
outfielders Jeff Stone and Keith
Hughes to Baltimore for out-
fielder Mike Young; and acquired
utility infielder Bill Almon from
the New York Mets for two
minor-league pitchers.

He also signed free-agent pitch-
er David Palmer.

Baumer joined the Phillies in
1978 as a special assignment
scout and became director of
minor-league and scouting in
1981. A former major-league
player, he began scouting with
Houston in 1968 and moved in
1972 to Milwaukee, where two
years later he became director of
player development and
scouting.

Giles said he was satisfied with
Baumer as a judge of talent but
felt he failed in the area of player
development.

Giles refused to comment on

his reasons for firing Woodward.‘-‘it —

’’I guess you live with people
for six months and you learn
more about them,” Giles said.

’’I feel it is best for the organi-
zation to get somebody else in
that role.

Giles was asked if the firing of
Woodward was because the de-
posed personnel director wanted
to go in one direction and Giles
in another. 45!

”No comment,” he responded.

ThePhillies, believed by many
in preseason to be a contender in
the NL East, entered Tuesday
night's game in Montreal in last
place, 15 games behind the
division-leading New York Mets.

Shore, a former major-league
pitcher and for many years a
scout with the Cincinnati Reds,
joined the Phillies two years ago
and has been the club's chief
scout.

”He is a good judge of talent,”

Giles said. ”He will examine the?’ ~

minor-league system, talk with
the major-league managers and
coaches and have recommenda-
tions ready for the new man
when he comes on board.

Giles defended the club's re-
cent free-agent player drafts. He
claimed the drafts had been bet-
ter than in the mid-1970s and ear-
ly 1980s, when the Phillies were
a perennial contender, winning
five division titles from 1976 to
1983, two NL championships
and one World Series.

Giles said he preferred that
Woodward's successor have a
National League background and
said his choice must be a player-
development person.

‘'1 have people in mind,” Giles .or

said. ”Most of them are working
for other clubs. And I have a
hunch people will apply that I am
not aware of.”

Dallas Green, former Phillies
manager and farm director who
resigned as president of the
Chicago Cubs last year, was not
a candidate for either job, Giles
said.

He said the same of Larry
Bowa, a former Phillies and Cubs
shortstop fired last month as
manager of the San Diego Padres.
He added, however, that Bowa
was being considered for a job in
another capacity.

Her sheepskin as white as snow.
Now she can afford her BMW
And her brand new condo.

They all ended up, down at the S.O.D.
Did you ever see such a sight,

As three MBA’s?
