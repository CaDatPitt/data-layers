Chinese
nationals

may stay
in U.S.A.

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

People’s Republic of China
nationals in the United States are
writing congressmen, hoping
that recently-introduced
legislation will enable them to
remain in the United States.

On June 6, Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh authorized
an Extended Deferred Departure
status, which allows Chinese
nationals to stay in the United
States until at least June 5, 1990.
In accepting EDD status, however,
Chinese nationals become
ineligible for visa adjustment or
application for permanent
resident status. The EDD status
creates a catch—22 situation for
the Chinese students and other
nationals, who feel they would
be in danger if required to return
to China.

“EDD requires that it is the
applicants’ responsibility to

indicate their unwillingness to .

return to [The People’s Republic
of China] at this time. This puts
the applicants in direct
confrontation with the Chinese
government, and it will inevitably
become an excuse for the Chinese
government to persecute the
Chinese students and scholars in
the program who do return to
China later,” wrote Bing Yu in a

letter to Pennsylvania
representatives. Yu is the
president of Pitt’s Chinese

Students and Scholars Friendship
Association.

Another current problem faced
by Chinese nationals in the United
States. is that China requires its
students and scholars to seek _]-1
exchange visas, which oblige the
holder to return to China for at
least two years before applying
for a change to any other non-
immigrant status or obtaining an
immigrant visa.

According to Yu, “The vast

’ majority of the Chinese students

and scholars who hold J-1 visas

‘were forced by, the Chinese

government to apply for [them]
against their will.”

l W grants $1.5 millin toward
Campaign for the Third Century

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

The Alcoa Foundation
presented the University of

Pittsburgh with a $1.5 million

grant to be used toward various
scientific and humanities

P programs. According to Bruce

’_.

Loessin, Pitt’s vice president for
University Relations and
Development, the grant
represents the Alcoa Fou ndation’s
main commitment to the
university’s Campaign for the
Third Century, which started in
1986 with zfgoal of $225 million.
The campaign has currently
generated. $149 million.

“This is not only a big
commitment, but" is also well
focused and organized to meet
the needs of the university. The
Alcoa Foundation is one of the
best in the country. [It] did studies
to determine what the university’s
needs were and how to ﬁll them,"
he said.

One beneficiary is the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, which
will receive funding for its
immunological monitoring and
diagnostic laboratory. The lab is
one.of two facilities in the United
States engaged in... developing

methods to evaluate the effects _

   

of various cancer therapies.
“We’re very pleased about
corporate support and generosity.

[The grant] has a very positive .

impact on the institute. It’s an
indication of corporate support

. for the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute

and [its] progress and growth,”

said Dr. Jules Heisler," the

institute’s associate director for
Administration Research. and
Treatment.

~ Another target area is funding
for the establishment of the
Manufacturing Systems
Engineering Program in the
School of Engineering. Dr. John
Manley, directorof the program,

_ views it as an industry-university

partnership.

“Alcoa was one of the original
partners in the development of
the program,” he said. “The
products are educated engineers.
It’s an exciting program, and I’m
constantly anxious [about] that
first class.”

Although its primary thrust is
on the technical aspects of
manufacturing ‘ systems,
candidates for the program's
master of science in engineering
degree will study related
governmental, environmental,

economic and cross-cultural
in. both . American and - 

   

  

foreign manufacturing systems.
This additional information will
be provided by research
performed by two non-
engineering programs,- the
Institute for Industrial
Competitiveness at theJoseph M.
Katz Graduate School of Business

and the University Center for ,

International Studies. Both are
recipients of funds from the grant.-
Shahidulla Muhammed, the
research associate ' for
international science and
technology at the Center. for
International Studies, said that
the center’s portion of thegrant
will fund the study of
organizational ‘strategies and
technical innovations of industrial
centers in Japan and Western
Europe. The study will involve
visits to these industrial centers
“to gain first-hand knowledge of
how science and technology are
organized in those centers. I see
[the study] in the context of

increased , [American]
competitiveness with these
countries.”

The Center for Latin American
Studies will also receive funding

tocarry out its own international .

studies programs-. According to
center Director Mitchel Seligson,

in room

By Jerome ibehmann
Staff Writer

The dreams of Pittsburgh
Ukrainians, who have struggled
since the 19505 to have their
ethnic heritage enshrined at the
Cathedral ofLearning, will finally
come true this summer, when
construction will begin on Pitt’s
23rd nationality room.

Director of Nationality Rooms
Programs Maxine Bruhns said '
she is overjoyed “at the Ukrainian
effort to raise funds for the new
room. The Ukrainians don’t have
an angel, or large su m contributor,
and [have] to raise the estimated
$250,000 project cost through
bake sales .and radiothons."

Until 1975, university policy
speciﬁed that only officially
recognized countries, not ethnic _ ' i '
groups, could be represented by
a room in the Cathedral. Since the‘-
policy was changed, there have
been two other Soviet republic ‘

I

 
 

and the Armenians, who hav
erected rooms.

, Eugene Manasterski, a member A
of the Ukrainian room fund'-’,
raising committee, said that “the ' i
university has a Russian room,
though Ukrainians have been irate ;
for centuries when identified as“.
Russians. Ukrainians are distinctly, '
different in language and culture.
from the other 18 Soviet“
republics." . . S I 

The project will be designed _
by Lubomyr Kalynych of New-”
Jersey, and the architect is Walter"
a professor at
Carnegie Mellon University. The
construction is expected to last _,
six to nine months _and will be
performed by four local artisans;
who are skilled in woodworking.‘
and ceramics. \' 1 9  if

The room will feature a large» 
ceramic fireplace, carved wood. .
icons, and a hammered copper
mural around the circumference
of the room with inscriptions-*’
depicting the four major periods:
of_ Ukrainian history. The _de.'sign=_j
of the room displays a common '
Ukrainian house duringthe 17th 
and 18th centuries. Bruhnsfsaid
that university guidelines for the,‘
rooms stipulate that they must
portray a period ‘before 1'787‘;

WASHINGTONCAP)
President Bush, declaring the
American flag a “unique national
symbol,” Tuesday called for a
constitutional amendment to set

. aside last week's Supreme Court

decision and forbid flag
desecration.
“As president, I will uphold our
precious right to dissent, but
burning the flag goes too far, and
‘I want to see that matter
remedied,” said Bush, at a news
conference. A
His announcement came as
efforts were already advancing in
Congress to condemn last week's
decision extending First
Amendment free speech rights to
protestors who burn the flag.
The House was expected to act
on a resolution later in the day,
denouncing the 5-4 ruling. The
Senate has already voted
“profound disappointment” with
it.
Bush, who made patriotism,
the ﬂag and the pledge of
allegiance a central theme in his

1988 presidential campaign,
asserted, “I think respect for the
flag transcends political party and
I think what I've said here is
American. It isn't Republican or
Democrat, it isn't liberal or
conservative."

He said adding an amendment
to the Constitution would be the
only foolproof way to set aside
the Supreme Court ruling, which
nullified ﬂag-desecration laws in
48 states. _

New ‘Contact Team‘ to improve communications
between campus cops and Oakland community

By Erik Kridle
Asst. News Editor

To attain his goal of improved
communications between Pitt's
Department of Public Safety and
other segments of the university
and Oakland community, Public
Safety Director Bill Brennan has
created a new two-member force
he calls the “contact team” to take
this challenge head—on.

“The whole purpose of the
Public Safety Department is not
just to make arrests,” Brennan
said. “Our job is to service the
people."

One aspect of service which
cannot be ignored by the Campus
Police, according to Brennan, is
going out into the university and
Oakland commuriities, askingfor
complaints as well as suggestions,
and acting upon them in a
“reasonable” time period. This is
the job of the 2-month—old Pitt

'0 ur ame Say
It An... ‘

Police Contact Team.

Karen McKee Jones, team
member, said she loves the
challenge.

“We’re trouble—shooters,” she
said of herself and her vacationing
partner Mark Smith. “You give us
a problem, and we’ll take care of
it.”

Jones said herjob involves more
“proactive” crime prevention, as
opposed to “reactive” law
enforcement.

“We go to groups and ask them
‘What can we do for you to make
this campus safer for you?’ “ she
said. A

According toJones, the answers
she receives to that question vary
with the type of person she asks,
and if they are staff, with the
position they hold at the
university.

Within the next few months,
Jones and her partner plan on
giving lessons on hold-up

IlA‘lll FASHIONS

procedure to employees at the
cashier’s office, instruction on
personal safety to this fall’s
incoming law students, and
seminars on the problems of rape
to both employees and students.
All of these services will be
provided at the request of campus
community groups.

Jones added that poorly lighted
areas on campus are also her
personal concern. When she
meets with students or staff
members, she encourages them
to make her aware of any areas
on campus where additional
lighting is needed.

 Prior to their appointment to
the contact team, bothjones and
Srnithlserved as Campus Police

field officers. Jones said she

enjoyed field duty but enjoys
contact team work even more.‘
“I love it,” Jones said‘. “This is a
great way to meet people,” which
is something she has enjoyed

     

doing all of her life.

By showing concern for the
safety needs of the community
which they serve, Brennan said
he believes the Campus Police
will grow in stature in the eyes of
the public.

Brennan is proud of his team.
According to him, both members
of the contact team recently
attended the grand opening of a
housing development nearby to
meet with the new residents and

‘discuss any concerns they might
have about living so close to the
Pitt campus.

“They went on their off day,”
he said proudly. “This is a great
example of the kind of dedication
these people possess”

-However, Brennan said that
student perception of Pitt police
officers must improve.

g “If students know they can
count on Pitt police officers for
help, even if it’s just for directions

<

.

around campus, students will be
more likely to report crimes to
us,” he said.

He also feels that although
increases in the reporting of
crimes will initially look like an
increase in the amount of crime
on campus, the opposite will
occur. With more time and effort
going into solving crimes,
Brennan believes crime rates on
campus will eventually decrease.

“I want people
comfortable with us,” he said.

With all these present plans
and expectations for firm rc results
Brennan has placed on himself
and the department, it seems

only naturalthat he shou_-ldl'.'feel ‘

some pressure. But not Brennan.
“There is no pressure,” he said.
“We are all having fun doing this.
‘ “This is the way
enforcement should be.”

most effective methods of raising
money has been two radiothons,
organized by Michael Komochak,
manager of WPIT radio station.
His efforts raised $15,000 at a

Bruhns commented that the

sponsored by local Ukrainians,
with no collaboration from any
of the 55 million people living in
the actual Soviet republic.

Manasterski said that “the Soviet
government is changing, but
Ukrainia is still under communist
subjugation, and the government
would not be thrilled with what
[it] would perceive as our attempt
to encourage Ukrainian
nationality.”

Jaszcun added, “The Ukrainian
nationality room at the university
will be an expression ofour love
and sacrifice for the culture and
history of Ukrainia, and of our
wish to pass on this love to future
generations.”

Pelosi would modify the EDD
status to allow Chinese nationals,
if otherwise eligible, to change
status and to apply for permanent
resident status if they qualify.
This legislation would also
provide for a blanket waiver of
the J—1 visa’s two-year return
resident requirement for PRC

nationals.

“We have gotten calls, even
visits, from students all over the
country, and everyone seems to
be supportive,” said Craig
Middleton, a press aide to Pelosi.

The legislation is scheduled to

be heard July 19 by the House
subcommittee on immigration.
There are currently 125 co-
sponsors for Pe1osi’s bill.

“We’d like to have 200 to 300
co-sponsors," said Middleton. “If
we get more people to write to
their congressmen, we can get
this thing moving faster.”

If the bill is passed, will the
Chinese government be willing
to grant future visas, knowing
that their stipulations will be

.waived in the United States?

According to Middleton, “that’s a
good question.” _

THE P|'lT NEWS

Since 1939, the pages of comic
books have been stalked by
Batman, a dark figure who stands
for justice, even though he often
works outside the law. Now, 50
years later, the character is still
going strong, with the debut of
the film, Batman.

Batman, as directed by Timothy
Burton and written by Sam Hamm,
is a dark and moody story set in
Gotham City, a modern—day urban
nightmare. Crime is spiralling out
of control, and neither the efforts
of Commissioner James Gordon
(played by actor Pat Hingle) nor
those of District Attorney Harvey
Dent (Billy Dee Williams) are
enough to put a dent in Gotham’s
crime syndicate. That syndicate
is run by a man named Carl
Grissom, played byJack Palance,
and his right-hand man Jack
Napier. Napier isportrayed by
Jack Nicholson and later, in a
hideous accident, Napier
becomes the Joker. ,

This stellar—supporting cast
surrounds one of the most
controversial casting decisions
ever made. To play the role of
Batman, Burton chose Michael
Keaton. There was a huge
controversy over this decision, as
many fansof the comic book felt
that Keaton did not have the
build or the capacity for grimness
that they expected from the Dark
Knight. Premiere magazine
quoted one angry letter to Warner
Bros. Inc. that accused the ﬁlm
makers of “defecating” on
Batman’s history and tradition by
casting a “clown” to play the part.

But Warner Bros. Inc. stood by
Burton's decision (after all, this
sort of controversy generally
makes for big box-ofﬁce returns),
and Michael Keaton proved the
doornsayers wrong.

Batman is a magnificent ﬁlm.

It seems fitting that Metallica

. and The Cult are touring together.

Both groups are excellent
examples of bands that started at
the extreme edges of the musical
‘cosmos and slowly twisted their
way to the brink of the center of
that cosmos; the swirling void
known as the mainstream.

The Cult emerged from the
British psychedelic/Gothic rock
underground, and Metallica was
delivered up from the saturated

' West Coast metal scene. Both

bands have converged on the
“popular”_ music vista" like a
turbulent natural disaster, creating
an uproar among longtime fans
and finding acceptance from the
less dedicated who want to be
part of the “hottest” musical trend.

Dabbling in the mainstream is
a double- edged sword for bands
in this class. Devoted fans are
happy to see their favorites get
some well-deserved recognition,
but hearing their songs played in

Wednesday, June 28, 1989

Although it suffers from some
serious problems, it is hard not to
like the ﬁlm.

The biggest problem that the
film seems to have is more of a
mixed blessing than a curse. Jack
Nicholson is unbelievably good
as the Joker. His performance is
potentially Oscar material, if the
academy can overcome the stigma
of the role’s comic book origin.
The problem here is that
Nicholson overshadows every

single other aspect of the film._

Michael Keaton gives an
outstanding performance that, on
a first viewing of the film, could
almost go unnoticed.

The Joker has almost twice as
much time on—screen as Batman,
and Nicholson is inspired in his
portrait of insanity. Credit (or
blame) for the power of theJoker’s
part must also be given to Sam
Hamm and Warren Skaareh, who
wrote the screenplay. Their
version of the Joker seems taken
from the Batman comics of the
’70s, written by Steve Englehart
and drawn by Marshall Rogers.
There is the same brand of
homicidal insanity with a twisted
theatrical ﬂair.

But it is important to stress that
Michael Keaton does an
extraordinary job as Bruce
Wayne/Batrnan. It is easy to fail
to see the strength of it for a
number of reasons. Bruce
Wayne’s parents were gunned
down in front of him when he

.was,a boy. Because_,of this, ‘_l:i,e,__._

"spent his life trairiingfhimself in

. the arts of combat, so that he can

spend his life avenging‘their

deaths and punishing criminals. S

The character is withdrawn and
almost psychotic (some would
say completely psychotic). The
nature of the character is much
more grim than that of The Joker
and the performance may seem

less powerful. Just keep in mind. I

playing more articulate and well-
deﬁned rock without losing any
of the speed and power they
based the band on.

But if Metallica fans think that
the band has overcome great
obstacles, then a look at The
Cult’s achievements would leave
them envious.

Starting with the Southern
Death Cult in 1982, singer/
founder Ian Astbury began
weaving a mysterious musical
atmosphere through the British
pop underground. This
atmosphere carried over to Death
Cult, which Astbury formed in

1983 with current Cult members
Billy Duffy (guitar) and Jamie
Stewart (bass).

Both bands became known for
their ﬂamboyant and fiery outlook
as well as a sound filled with
imagery, texture and internal
contrasts. '

After a short-lived success with
the predecessors, the group
became known simply as The
Cult in 1984 with the release of
their debut album, Dream Time.

Their previous releases (with
Southern Death Cult and Death
Cult) faired well on the
independent charts, and Dream

Time brought The Cult critical
acclaim in Britain, but the group
had only received moderate
attention here in the states (mostly
on college radio).

It was the 1985 release of Love
and the single “She Sells
Sanctuary,” that edged The Cult
into the US. charts.

Electric was released in 1986,
and it contained heavy overtones
of hard rock, American style, a
touch that the band had picked
up while spending time here.
The album’s metal edge could
also be attributed to the
involvement of Def Jamheavy
Rick Rubin, known for his work

- with Slayer and Danzig. This

album was also a milestone in
that it uncovered many of The
Cult’s inﬂuences — Janis Joplin,

Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, AC/ .

DC, Motorhead and the Rolling
Stones — andibrought them to
the front along with the bands
own personal style.

1989 broughtwhat critics claim
is The 'Cult’s most impressive
album yet, Sonic Temple. The-
recording embodies an overall
musical feel for The Cult since it
fuses the foreboding, cerebral

why Burton chose Keaton for the
role. In several interviews, Burton
stated that he chose Keaton for
his eyes, claiming, “if you look at
this guy’s eyes, you know he’s
crazy.”

It’s true. Watch Keaton’s eyes
during the film, if you want to
understand the character a bit
more.

The film has several aspects
that will make the die—hard comic
book fan cringe. Some of these
are merely throwbacks to the
1959 Batman mythos (Batman's
creator, Bob Kane, was technical
consultant for the ﬁlm, and it

  

shows), others are serious
violations of the comic book
tradition. These parts of the film
are not just carelessness. The
changes from the comic book
reﬂect the necessary changes in
format, from a monthly comic
book to feature film. So, it’s
important that Bat—fanatics contain
their outrage and try" to look at
the film as a film, and not as a
comic book on a screen.

Basinger as Vicki Vale yet because
there isn’t much to mention. With

A. Bartlett Giamatti is find-
ing himself in an unenviable
position. As the newly appointed
commissioner of Major League
Baseball, Giamatti is attempting
to prove himself to baseball per-
sonnel and fans as at worthy
replacement to Peter Ueberroth,
who guided pro baseball to new
heights as the previous commis-
sioner.

But as the Pete Rose gam-
bling debacle began to unfold
before Giamatti’s eyes, as well as
those of baseball fans, Giamatti
was faced with the prospect of
the first major decision of his
short-lived baseball career. A
report filed to Giamatti by inter-
nal investigators stated that Rose
did indeed bet on baseball, and

went so far as to say he bet on the

Reds.
Betting on baseball carries
a one-yearsuspension, and bet-
ting on the Reds would mean a.
lifetime suspension for Rose,
should he. be found guilty. , I
Fully, knowing his chances

t rs_hou1cc_l~hé_ appear at , a hearing . .~

 

     
 

before Giamatti, Rose filed last
Friday for a temporary restrain-
ing order that would allow him
two more weeks — until July 14
— to find a different course of
action.

When the order was filed
Sunday by OhioJudge Norbert A.

Nadel, Rose had won a battle
with Giamatti, who he claimed
was prejudiced against him in the
first place and had already de-
cided that Rose was guilty. Rose’s
legal action was the first in an
attempt to move the hearing into

' a court of law and out of the

office the commissioner.

Rose’s contention is that he
will not get a fair trial from
Giamatti. And even if Rose is
found innocent, Giamaui’s deci-

sion will surely affect the game

much more than the outcome of

Rose’s trial. ' _ . _
For example,t.70 years ago’ V.

 

in what is now known as the
Black Sox scandal, eight mem-
bers of the Chicago White Sox,
including Shoeless Joe Jackson,
were accused of throwing the
1919 World Series. Before a
grand jury, the eight were found
innocent and acquitted of all
charges. But Kenisaw Mountain
Landis, who had taken the office
of the commissioner with the
overwhelming approval of the
club owners, decided that, in
order to uphold the integrity of
baseball, and as well as to display

his new power, banned all eight-

from baseball for life.

With the resurrection of
Jackson in the movies Eight Men
Out and Field of Dreams, the
nation’s interest has turned to-
ward seeing Jackson enshrined
in the Hall of Fame. Despite the
ban, Jackson is considered one
of the greatest players of this
century, holding the third-high-

est batting average of the cen-’ _

of the Igrseatest ;P1aY€:I$ 

   

  

century. He broke Ty Cobb’s all-
time hit record, in 1985, and is
also the all-time singles leader.
The question is not if Pete Rose
will make it to Cooperstown, but
when. ‘

_ But is Pete Rose bigger than
baseball? Is the commissio-ner
bigger than the game?

No, on both counts. The
game will endure after this epi-
sode, although more dirtied than
before. '

But as this incident quickly
becomes a battle of wills and
egos, it is apparent that the case
simply cannot be decided by
Giamatti. The case must go to
court, and Giamatti must allow
the ruling to stand and not use his
power to counter the court’s find-
ings. Giamatti will surely suffer

more for it than Rose, should‘

Ask any kid what the best thing

Ask any coach what the most

important thing about basketball
is and he’ll tell you it’s fundamen-
tals.
, The Pitt coaching staff is spon-
soring a basketball camp held in
Fitzgerald Field House that com-
bines these two aspects of the
sport.

The camp is in its second ses-
sion of the summer. Next week
there is an overnight camp and
there is a day camp during the
first week of August.

“We put a lot of emphasis an

tals, team play and that type of

, to return  

U‘.

in July

On Friday, July 14, the Pitts-
burgh Gladiators will host the
Denver Dynamite in the return of
arena football to Pittsbu rgh’s Civic
Arena.

It is the only Pittsburgh appear-
ance scheduled in the Gladiators’
four-game 1989 season. The
Gladiators play Chicago in Sacra-
mento on July 22, Denver at
Cleveland’s Richfield Coliseum
on July 28, and Maryland in the
final regular season game in
Washington, D.C., on Aug. 5.

Joe Haering will be back as the
Gladiators’ coach. “It’s a pleasure
to be coaching again in Pitts-
burgh,” said Haering. “I wish we
had more than one home game
for our fans, but I enjoy coaching
these players — they've got to go
