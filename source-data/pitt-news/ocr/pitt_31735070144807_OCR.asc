He said that while asbestos is embedded
in building materials, it’s not a danger.

Exposure to asbestos only occurs when

 Smoking tax puts  
  tobacco to’ good use 

Smoking has taken a beating in
public recently. From the widely

: criticized smoking ban in Pennsyl-
V Vania restaurants and workplaces to
. so—called “15-foot” rules that force
smokers to stand a certain distance
away from doors, it’s never been

less popular to light up. And now

3 being a smoker is going to cost a lot

more, thanks to a 156 percent tax
increase on packs of cigarettes.
On Wednesday, a new tax hike
is set to take effect that will raise
the per-pack tax on cigarettes from
39 cents to $1.01. Other tobacco
products will see a signiﬁcant bump
in taxes, as well. The revenue from

i the tax will go toward funding a ma-
I jor expansion of health insurance

for children through the Children’s
Health Insurance Program.
i Some people will argue that this

I places an undue burden on smok-
.: ers, and that it isn’t fair to heavily
; tax a product to which many people
' are addicted. But the facts suggest
i differently, and a logical analysis of
V the problem bears this out.

The government has clearly ,
5 established smoking as a public
. health risk. Smoking bans and 15-

foot rules show a clear legislative
preference for labeling secondhand

‘ smoke as a detriment to public

health. Also, the health problems

 related to smoking drive health care

costs up, increasing the burden for

 health care programs across the
= entire population, non—smokers
‘ included. '

This tax represents what is

I known as a Pigovian tax, in which

an activity that creates a negative

. external effect is taxed to balance

out that negative effect in the mar- i
ket ——- or society in general. In this ‘
case, the negative health effects of
smoking are being balanced out by
a tax that is used to beneﬁt chil- 
dren’s health insurance. One could .
see the tax as a way for smokers to
pay their accrued debts to society
for creating a health risk with their :
activities. V

There’s also the added beneﬁt
that this tax could prompt more :
people to quit smoking now that ,
the costs are signiﬁcantly higher. j
A portion of people will always be i
willing to pay the extra money, but 
this tax could be a severe discour— 
agement for a large portion of the ,
smoking population. ’

In a way, this tax is really pay- 
ing for itself twice: not only is it 
creating extra revenue for CHIP,
it’s also reducing the public health 
costs of smoking by giving more 
people an incentive to quit. _

Quitting isn’t always aneasy 

V prospect for people who smoke. To -

combatthe possibility that people 
addicted to cigarettes — or any ;
tobacco product — might not be 
able to handle it on their own, the ;
government should also support an 
increase in the presence and avail- 3
ability of programs and materials 
designed to help people quit, such A
as telephone “quit lines” and sup-
port groups.

In the end, the tax might be a
burden to smokers. But smoking is I
a burden to everyone around who i
doesn’t smoke, and it’s' only fair that
the people responsible for creating
that problem help shoulder some ;
of the cost to pay it off.

U2’s Claw shows Bono’s hypocritical attitude

by the band. The set will straddle a
circular stage and allow ravenous fans
to View the band from all angles.
Designed by U2’s show director, a
man with the distinct misfortune to be
named Willie \Williams, and reportedly

previous record—holder for the largest
stadium set from The Rolling Stones’

2005 “A Bigger Bang” tour.

The l64—foot-tall set will be made ‘

of solid steel, with each arm housing
18 subwoofers and requiring the same
amount of electricity needed to power
an entire arena. Fans will be merci-
lessly assaulted by The Edge’s 
guitars and Bono’s great unglassed
activism. ” 0

But speaking of Bono’s activism,
what happened to Africa?

He’s well,-known for his philan-
thropy and advocacy. As the co-

founder of multiple humanitarian ’

organizations and brands like Product
Red and the ONE Campaign, he’s
been nominated for a Nobel Prize

and awarded an honorary knighthood. '

He’s brought millions of dollars to
the African continent to help with
AIDS relief; fair wages, labor ethics
and refugee support.

. Bono seems, surprisingly, like a
rock star with a conscience, like some-
one who hasn’t forgotten about people
with two names or their problems.

But as much as Bono has nied to

model himself and, more importantly,
his image after the socially aware mu-
sicians of the past  big ﬁsh who
fought for the guppies of . the world
like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger
— he can’t seem to’ shake the idea

i of being -Bono. And The Claw is the

most recent and colossal example.‘
The estimated cost of The Claw
hasn’t been released, but one can safely
assume it doesn’t fall in the three- or
four-digitrange. Moneywill undoubt-
edlyibe poured into it and in large
amounts. They’ll have to pay for the
steel framework and the scores of
speakers, plus the electticity needed to

power the set and the fuel for the 120'

trucks required to transport it between
cities, not to mention the personnel
needed to design, manufacture, move,
assemble, disassemble and oversee
the behemoth,  appears to have
been styled after either a crab or one
of Isaac Asimov/s nightmares.
Taking this into account, Bono
appears to be the worst  of hypo-
crite — one who isn’t at all aware that

he is one. His band is spending untold
thousands on something designed
purely to make them look cool, all
as he supposedly crusades to rescue
a continent.

I’m not the first to bash Bono.

A He has attracted criticism for his hu-
manitaiian work over the past few '

decades from those who think rock
stars should stick to drugs, sex and
 music about select subjects,
namely drugs and sex.

But there’s no need for him to
abandon his efforts. I am not sug-

' gesting that he play to the stereotype

of the musician, and I have no 
with a celebrity  their fame to
beneﬁt others. Eddie Vedder of Pearl
Jam and the powerhouse duo that
is Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie seem
to manage without sacrificing their
stardom. Bono is simply attempting
to live two lives that do not get along
well, and soon, one of themwill have
to end. ' 0
Singers rely on their audience

believing the words they warble.

If Bono wants his listeners to take
kindly to tunes about life in Dublin,
he shouldn’t drop his Irish accent. If
he wants them to tolerate the idealistic
ramblings of songs like “One,” he
should continue blathering about the
mystery and magic of rock ’n’ roll in
countless interviews.

And if he wants anyone to believe
that he actually cares about Aﬁica and
its people, he should stop spending
extraordinary amounts of money on
gargantuan and, in all honesty, absurd
concert sets

Bono has a choice. He can cement
himself as a humanitarian hero by
continuing to champion human rights
and global awareness Or he can keep
on -under soaring sets and
join Kiss and Spinal Tap in the realm
of the ridiculous.

Unless The Claw has a cure for
AIDS, poverty, hunger and war, he
can’t choose both.

Lettertotheeditor

To the Editor,

I am writing in regards to the article in the paper for Monday, March 29 about Greek
Sing titled, “Oompa Loompas, James Bond take over stage.” I was very disappointed
_that all of the houses that won awards were not mentioned. It seemed very unfair that
there was room for four extensive paragraphs about a house that didn’t place and com-
ments about “fluttering skirts,” but somehow the writer could not even fit in the name
of all the houses that won awards. This is including Theta Phi Alpha and Lambda Chi
Alpha, which won third place and most original, and Tri Sigma and Phi Delta Theta,
which won the best vocals award. ,
I am aware that the purpose of the event is not to win awards but to raise money for
the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, which I do believe is a great cause. Houses
spend ‘months preparing elaborate shows to make this event truly great so others will
want to attend and support that great cause. It is absolutely unacceptable when they
succeed in this and their efforts go unnoticed by your staff writers.

BLIND PILOT
Wednesday, 9 p.m.
Club Cafe, South Side

412-431-4950

In a musical climate where the
biggest tours roll around the coun-
try with ‘dozens of massive buses,
trucks and planes further blasting
the environment to damnation, it’s
refreshing to hear about an act like
Blind Pilot. The acoustic folk band
spent last summer on tour, just like
countless other bands -— but-these
guys did it all on their bikes.

‘We went from Washington to
San Diego. From just below Canada
to just above Mexico,” said Blind
Pilot’s singer Israel Nebeker. “And
it wasn’t the ﬁrst time. We’d planned
a bike tour before but didn’t make
it so far. We got our bikes stolen in
San Francisco.”

Nebeker’s freewheeling, almost
whimsical spirit carries through, per-
fectly in his music. His high, 
voice taps out melodies like The
Shins’ James Mercer over his own
gently strummed  and college

Rev your engines, Vin Diesel is back in action

 

' by Tom VaI_1Buren.

Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

 

I had a dream about Vin Die-

_ sel the other .night.

I had somewhere to be — as
it is in dreams, it wasn’t relevant
either where or why —— and he
pulled up in his shining black ‘stal-
lion, the 1970 Dodge.Charger

from “The Fast and the Furious” ~

with the engine protruding out
of the hood. I only remember

were at our destination within
10 seconds. ' _ V

The time, it would seem, is
upon us —— After eight long years,
the cast of the original movie is
reuniting in this Friday’s glori-
ously titled “Fast & Furious.” Paul
Walker recently conﬁrmed j that
‘studio execs want a ﬁfth install-
ment in the illegal street-racing
series, and I can’t be surprised

—— the series is _both a lucrative

action franchise and an engaging,
unwitting satire.

Yes, satire. A

but the series is blatant, uninten-
tional irony T-— an inadvertent joke
with itself for a punchline. Over
eight years it has transformed

from something barely serious_

to a fearfully brilliant, self—ref—

To make myself clear, the se-

ries is still stupid. It is a brainless‘

parade of fast cars‘, babes and
D-list rappers. But in a time when
making something so absurd is
considered hip, the series dares
to take itself seriously. In the past
few years, bad action movies have

of the willfully stupid. Instead
they motor on, zipping around
the streets of Los Angeles, Mi-
ami, Tokyo or wherever else they
can meet their need for speed,
or a life without rules, or what-
ever. It’s frivolous and cliche’, it’s
unconscious stupidity —— unlike

erentially derisive
mockery of itself,
its genre and its
audience.

tiates its need for

Nebeker and Dobrowski prove that two

guys and two bikes can .equal greatmusic
and an unforgettable journey. ' i

‘the band has even booked it’s ‘biggest tour

ever —— with prog—folk heroes The December.-
ists, a band whose humble sound on its first
record wasn’t unlike the unassuming beauty
of Blind Pilot. ’

Blind Pilot’s debut album, 3 Rounds and A
Sound, collects the ﬂowing vibe of life on the
road, weaving in -and out of ethereal melodies
just like the band weaved in and out of Cali—'
fornia towns. Tracks like the nothing—short—of—

lovely “The Story I Heard” ﬁnd Nebeker’s voice -

soaring with melodies that’ll stick with you all

, day — and likely put a smile on your face.-

Shades of Iron and Wine, Neutral Milk
Hotel and even Simon & Garfunkel show up

throughout 3 Rounds, all with a ﬁnge more '

urgency and carried by steady shuffle beats
and rhythrnic guitar. '

But if you hear something completely dif-
ferent, said Nebeker, that’s just ﬁne. Much like
his sentiment toward touring, Nebeker’s feelings
on his fans are free and easy. V

"‘I think it’s important to remember that
when “people are hearing my songs, it’s. a two-
part process. I’m writing the songs, but the
process isn’t complete until they hear it,” said
Nebeker. “So if they hear something there,
it’s there.” i A

But whatever fans hear, only one  mat—
ters to the Portland crew: Just hear it.

The Pitt baseball team knew its three-
game weekend against Notre Dame would
be important, but knowing wasn’t enough.

Execution would be what mattered.

So, Pitt let its bats do the talking, scor-
ing a combined 29 runs to take the last
two games of the series after falling in the

opener.

ensured that pitching, defense and timely hit-
ting would determine -the game’s outcome.

Despite entering the weekend on a ﬁve—game

to Syracuse and St. John’s on the road trip.

The defeats lowered Pitt’s record to 14-13

Adams—Borza tandem stays
unbeaten, but Panthers lose

by Robbie Kleinmuntz
Staﬂ Writer

Pitt tennis has a No. 1 doubles tandem
that just will not lose. But on Sunday against
Syracuse, the Panthers’ singles just couldn’t
win.

Sophomore Elizabeth Adams and senior
Kristy Borza improved their doubles record
to 14-0 on the season with a win on Sunday,
but Pitt didn’t ﬁnd much success elsewhere on
the court in its 6-1 defeat to the Orange.

Pitt’s highlight once again was the Adams-
Borza duo. It took out Emily Harman and
Christina Tan from Syracuse, 8-6.

“This was deﬁnitely a great match to win
because their coach is known for doubles
and we always expect them to be good,” said
Adams. “I think [Borza] and I get better with
every match.”

At No. 3 doubles, senior Christie D’Achille
and junior Shannon Benic are now 7-0 to-
gether as a team. They blended together to
put forth an impressive performance to beat
Alessondra Parra and Simone Kalhorn, 8-2.

“[D’Achille and Benic] are awesome to-
gether,” said Adams. “They are great to have
at the No. 3 spot.”

Unfortunately, those were all of the posi-
tives that can be taken out of the Syracuse
match. It was one of those matches where
the players want to have a short—term memory
and forget about it the next day.

After winning the doubles point for the
13th time this season, the Panthers undefeated
Big East run came to an end as they lost all
six singles matches. It was payback for the
Orange (12-5, 6-2 Big East), who lost to Pitt
4-3 last year.

After losing at doubles, Harman and Tan
got their revenge on the Panthers in singles.
Harman stayed alive to beat Borza 6-3, 3-6,
6-2 at No. 1 singles, and Tan beat Adams 6-3,
6-4 at No. 2.

At No. 3 singles, freshman Minh Evans
lost to Kalhorn 6-1, 6-2. D’Achille lost to
Parra 7-6 (2), 6-2 at No. 4 singles.

“[Syracuse] just came out ready to play,”
said Adams. “We can deﬁnitely do better. It
was just a bad day for the Panthers.”

The Panthers are still conﬁdent that they
can ﬁnish near the top in the Big East. Adams
said that if the team is playing its best, they
can beat anyone.

Pitt (10—4, 5-1) will try to bounce back at
Duquesne on Wednesday at 12:30 p.m.
