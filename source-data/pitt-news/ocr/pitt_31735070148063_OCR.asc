Libya native Mahmoud Jibril
might have become the most
important Pitt graduate in the
world of politics.

in political science from -Pitt in
1985, has garnered international

media attention over the p_ast few ‘

weeks for his work with the Inter-
im National Council of Libya — a
rebel group based in the east-
ern Libyan city of Benghazi that

_ is currently locked in a bloody P.
' power struggle with" longtime
Jibril, who earned a doctorate '

dictator Moammar Gadhaﬁ.
Jibril has functioned as the

council’s main international dip- ‘

lomat. Many of the political sci—-
ence professors who knewjibril

‘ at Pitt said "he is an excellent fi

for the job. '

“If Libya can ever become a S
democratic society, this is the

kind of guy they need,” said Bert

Rockman, a former political sci— "

ence professor-at Pitt.

Rockman, who now heads the‘ ‘

political science department at
Purdue University, pointed to Ji-

- bril’s intelligence, foreign policy

expertise, western background
and eloquence as qualifications

Survey shows Pa. professors’

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (MCT) .

Professors at Pennsylvania’s 18 state—owned

paychecks last year compared to colleagues
at ‘comparable schools across the country,
according to a new survey. _
The survey by the American Association ‘

of University Professors looked at salaries

colleges. It found salary increases failed to
keep pace with inﬂation over the past two

_ years when salaries grew by 1.4 percent and
' 1.2 percent, respectively.

The numbers also showed average sala-
ries at Pennsylvania’s four state-related
schools —— the University of Pittsburgh,

for full professors ranged from $133,500 at

“We were working at Central

10 students at the school for a month

Butbecause of schedulingconﬂicts

was Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance through

surrounding stereotypes in both the

hassan said hewasverypleasedthatan
event like this took place.

Zammerilla agreed that becoming

on campus. As part of her platform,
Zammerilla ran with the intention of
spreading knowledge of her and "her
sororit.y’s work with St. Jude Hospital
in Squirrel Hill.

as well as all her efforts following her
victory to the success she has had ﬁ1r-
thering her work with St.]ude’s.

“Iamproudto saythat Pitt’s Tri—De1t
Chapter has raised over $17,000 this
yearfor St.]ude’s, making us one of the
top fundraisingchapters inthe nation,”
Zammerilla said in an e—mail.

This feat was accomplished by
numerous ﬁmdraising events, as well
as Zamrnerilla’s involvement in other
school clubs.

“Ithasbeen really relreshingto see
everyone unitefor such aworthy cause,”
Zammerilla said.

The idea behind the election of

presidentoftraditionsforthe Blueand '

homecoming. .

“The purpose of being elected
Homecoming king or queen is to be
recognized by your peers as an exem-
plary member of the undergraduate
student bodywho excelsinmanyfacets

Maryjean Lovett, manager of st11— I
dentand alumniprograms and adviser A

of the Blue and Gold Society, said that
there is a long-standing tradition be-
hind the positions of king and queen.
Lovett said that the responsibility of
overseeing the homecoming elections
used to fall under the Office of Student
Affairs.

The process was turned over to
the Alumni Association about seven
years ago. —

“There is always a large emphasis
placed on community service, and often
times, there will be a lot of work done
with Children’s Hospital ofPittsburgh,”
Lovett said.

book published by the University of Pitts-
burgh Press in 1988.

Alberta Sbragia, the vice provost of .

graduate students and former political sci-
ence professor who knewjibril during his
time at Pitt, said that having a dissertation
turned into a book is a good indication that
his dissertation was particularly strong.
Another Pitt professor who knewjibril
was Charles Gochman, an expert on world

a politics, international relations and con-

ﬂict studies. Gochman said that he remem-
bers havingjibril in class but thought that
his experience after leaving the University
was much more relevant to his new role
than any classroom work.
‘Rockmanvsaid that after graduation,

that rebels were “civilians with no skills

To achieve asatisfactory end to the -

option than the air strikes that NATO has

He suggested the possibility of a stale-

$92,200 at Temple to $73,800 at Lincoln.

Although professors at the 14 State Sys-
tem of Higher Education schools earned
slightly less than most of those at the state-

“You need to look at schools in the mid-

EDITORIAL‘

Thanks, but Pell

Grants aren’t enough

ooray?
’ - When Congress in-
deed approves the last-

minute budget compromise it
hammered out last Friday night,
then perhaps we can put aside
some of our fears, at least for now.
If you picked up the The Pitt News
in February, then you might re-
member our lamenting over the
House Republicans’ plan to cut
the‘ maximum Pell Grant by $845
in their 2011 budget bill. The good

news is in — Friday’s legislation 8

maintained the maximum Pell
Grant at its 2010 level, or $5,550
over an academic year. Good thing
we spoke up.

According to the Pitt Fact Book,
Pitt students got $22.2 million in
Pell Grants last year alone. In all,
10 million students studying at
American institutions receive
Pell Grants, need-based mon-
eys from the U.S. Department of
Education aimed to make college
more affordable for low—income
students.

If the Pell survives today’s vot-
ing session, it marks a clear and
laudable victory for Team Obama,
which fought for Pell Grants ear-
lier this year. It’s a victory that
deserves praise even as President
Barack Obama’s other education
priorities — like funding for the
National Institutes of Health or
National Science Foundation —
have lost ground.

But it’s too early to pop cham-

pagnein the Oval Office. And it’s -
not just because.Congress is pre-

paring to war with itself over yet
another budget -— yes, as much
as we’d like to ignore it, the 2012
ﬁscal year begins on Oct. 1.

No matter how many years
Obama extends programs like Pell
at ﬁxed levels, the central prob-
lem remains untouched — college
costs and the resulting debts are

» loans to pay off. _

skyrocketing, year after year. The
Pell Grant might be saved, but col-
lege affordability is not.

Reality check: Students of
American education are_riddled
with debt, unable to pay it off and
frustrated with an unyielding job
market. '

Fastwe‘b.com, a website that
helps students ﬁnd ﬁnancial aid,
reports that overall student loan
‘debt in 2010 not only surpassed
$800 billion, but it also surpassed
what once was the primary worry
among college students, credit
card debt. The average 2008 grad-
uate left campus with $27,000 in

Student debt like this, at least
in principle, isn’t the worst — af-
ter all, more students should ap-
proach college as the investment
that it is. But such philosophizing
becomes irrelevant when you look
at some more numbers: At the end
of 2009, according to the Depart-
ment of Education, $50.8 billion
of loans were in.default. In addi-
tion, a study from the Institute for
Higher Education Policy recently
found that two out of ﬁve student

borrowers become delinquent af-

ter beginning to repay loans.

As well, The New York Times
reported last month that the un-
employment rate among college
graduates under 25 years old has
risen to 11.2. percent, 2.2 percent
higher than the national aver-
age. I
' hile we hope the Pell Grant
extensions remain in place as bud-
getary votes are cast on Capitol
Hill today, we’re notgetting giddy
just yet. Congress still seems to be
ignoring the primary problem that
make Pell Grants necessary —
exorbitant college costs. Maybe,
when legislators convince schools
to drop their fees,’ we’ll actually

congratulate our legislators. I

The symptoms include a tingling

a strong desire to hula-hoop in

clude drowsiness, lack of motiva- _

disease is Pennsylvania sunshine,

' a mythical ailment that makes an »

appearance 10 days or so a year

versity into a damaging spiral of

frivolous socializing and delayed

As a Pittsburgh native, I knew

of the syndrome, and now that one’ _

day of sunshine has occurred, the
rest of campus knows it, too.‘
But I am fully aware that many

tence of Pennsylvania sunshine,
and many are probablycaughtby
surprise. Some might not know
what to do with themselves now.
that going outside doesn’t require
three wool layers and an indus-
trial-strength umbrella. For this
reason, I am offering a sugges-
tion _on how to spend your nine

‘other days of sunshine — a good,

old-fashioned Pennsylvania road

trip. . .
Many out—of—staters have likely

not even considered suchan op- ’

tion, as many are probably content

like partying and hanging with
friends on South Oakland porches.
But considering that this state is
actually one of the top 50 in the

true freedom and happiness that
these states could only dream of
offering.

Once you have been properly
enthralled, you should head east

ment the name suggests, but the

I recommend starting any
Pennsylvania road trip. by driv-

‘ Atwisted love triangle, complicated .

past and Charlie Sheen references all
weave together to form the plot of the
new play “Speak Now.”

This weekend, the Duquesne ,
— University Red‘Masquers, one of the

school’s theater groups, will present
the piece in the Peter Mills Theater
in Rockwell Hall on the Duquesne

campus. This will be the ﬁrst time -

this work by playwright and Pitt
alumnus Robert Isenberg, who is in
his 30s, will be performed.

The play tells the story of a
young couple’s wedding getaway to
a remote island that quickly takes a
dramatic turn. The majority of the

play takes place in one -location, but

there is aﬂashback scene to provide ’
' background information,helpingthe

audience understand the story.

The characters are all played by g

Duquesne University students and
assume fairly stereotypical roles that
the audience could potentially see in
other productions, like Kat, played by
Becca Hosier. Kat is both the female
protagonist and bossy ﬁancee of Ste-
fan, her pushover future husband,
played byjacob Wadsworth. Still, the
enthusiasm of the cast keeps the play
lively and carries the somewhat dull
and predictable characters through
the show. .

The play begins with a well-
decorated set and a-group of three
people casually drinking on a dimly
lit stage, accented with a set of col-
orful string lights. Dory, the maid of
honor played by Leighjohnson, sits
with Kat and Stefan, the soon-to —be—
married couple, on the night before
their wedding at a beachfront bar
late into the night. '

Dory seems crafted for comedic
relief but comes off as more loud and
obnoxious than funny. Numerous

times through the show, she irritat-
ingly brings up her lack of friends
other than the engaged couple. When
she interacts with the couple, which is
less than enthused about its upcom-
ing nuptials, —Dory seems like an
attention—seeking third wheel. This
gives the group an awkward dynamic
The trio comes off as too immature
to be realistic young adults.

During the ﬁrst act, a man sits
across the stage from the group in an
unlit area and sends a drink to Dory.
The audience laterlearns the gesture
was for Kat, who had a past relation-
ship with the mysterious man, Yuri
— the hotel owner —— played by T.].
Fimeno. There are multiple twists
like this that let the audience peek
into the relationships between the
characters as they reﬂect on roman-
tic entanglements and friendships
and the effect these interactions have
had on their lives.

The plot of “Speak Now” seems
reminiscent ofthe classic movie “Cas-
ablanca” at many points throughout
the play. Although it is set in modern

What do a young, inner-city black
man, a middle-age Polish-American
and a donut shop in Chicago have to
do with Pittsburgh?

According to actor Wali Jamal,
a lot. Jamal, who plays a straight-
laced black cop in the play “Supe-
rior Donuts,” calls the Windy City
in the production a carbon copy of
the Steel City. '

Pittsburgh Public Theater will
present Chicago playwright Tra-
cy Letts’ play as it aims to get the
Pennsylvania city to embrace its
history. _

“Superior Donuts” is set in the
declining era of the last independent
donut shop in Chicago’s Uptown. The

shop is now forced to compete with
the likes of Starbucks and other big
corporations.» . » .  -  ~ - 

“‘The shop, Superior Donuts,

itself is reminiscent of any [steel] .

mill or business in Homestead or
Braddock, PA’s Steel Valley,” Jamal
said. “Those businesses were mak-
ing strides and taking care of their

own. And that isn’t happening any-.

more with the decline of the steel
industry.”

Rob Zellers, director of education
at Pittsburgh Public Theater, said,
“[The play] could just as easily have
been set in Pittsburgh.”

In that regard, he said that in “Su-

perior Donuts,” “Pittsburghers will
ﬁnd the setting, the characters and
the situation very relatable.”
Jamal, who was born and raised
in Pittsburgh, agrees. “Pittsburghers

are going to identify very much with I

the‘ plight of these people and the

V struggle that goes on in the play,”

he said. _
For actor Brandon Gill, who

~ splays.-Franco Wicks; the optimistic
black assistant to the Polish donut _

shop owner, this story is also about
two unlikely characters becoming
friends. ' Z

— “The friendship between my
character, Franco, and this Polish
man inspires people from the neigh-
borhood who are not blood family
to form their own  family through
the two of them,” Gill said. “In how
these two characters interact in this
small town, it makes the big city of

MOVIE COLUMN

 

‘Dark Knight’ might not B
brighten ’Burgh’s reputation

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E. Editor

 

Local criminals, take heed: Batman will sweep
into Pittsburgh this summer. Whether he’ll be
our saving grace, however, should be called into
question.

The news that the Steel City will host a por-
tion of“The Dark Knight Rises,”thethirdBatrnan
installment, inspired avid and almost rapturous
excitement, buoyed inlarge partby local authori-
ties: Mayor Luke Ravenstahl promised in a state-
ment that the city would be “rolling out the red
carpet” for the ﬁlmmakers; and Dawn Keezer,
director of tlie Pittsburgh Film Oﬂice, assured
the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette that “A franchise as
prestigious as Batman opens our region up to an
entirely new audience.’-’

Online users also joinedinonthe fervor. “Pitts-
burgh has come a long way since the days of the
booming steel mills,” one commenter said on
the movie site ComingSoon.net. “When people
see Piusburgh transformed into Goth[a]m City,
I KNOW they will be very pleased with the out-
come.”

In many ways, of course, such anticipation
is understandable: Our city has set the stage for
countlessblockbusters before, includingthe Oscar-
winning‘”1“heDeerHunter” andthe macabre “The
Silence of the Lambs,” but never has it enjoyed
such a pivotal role in realizing, even deﬁning, the
capstone of a successful Hollywood franchise.

Beforethe hype spirals outof control, however,
it seems necessary to reevaluate how much Pitts-
burghwill actuallybeneﬁtfrom its “Dark Knight”
spotlight and whether that spotlight will be the
public relations miracle some have hoped for. I,
for one, doubt that the ﬁlm will lead audiences to
revise their perceptions of our city; that —— at the
riskofsoundinglikeadowner-—thisﬁlmisreally
our ticket to long-overdue respect. .

Asmuchaslhateto deﬂate the excitement, th
extent to which Pittsburghwill even be recogniz- V
able shouldbe called into question. _ »

It’s tempting, certainlygtofantasize about ayin
zer Batman ﬁlm — to envision our hero perched
solemnly atop, say, the  our

‘buildings rendered as majestic as Hong Kong’s in
‘.‘The Dark Knight.” But Hong Kong, quite clearly
the exception to the rule in this franchise, was
chosen speciﬁcally to evoke exoticism and a dis-
tinct sense of place. Pittsburgh, on the other hand,
will likely lose much of its aesthetic identity; pared
down like Chicago in the previous two ﬁlms to
resemble that anonymous gothic metropolis,
Gotham. That is, presumingPittsburghwillstand
in as Gotham — one would be hard pressed to
imagine a plotline calling for Batman to visit the
Steel City.

Evenifaudiencesweretocatchglimpsesoflo- V

callandmarks amidstaCGI—doctored cityscape——
certainly, PPG Place looks too sinisterforﬁlmmak-
ersto overlook—these glimpseswouldbe ﬂeeting
at best: Most of the action in Batman ﬁlms tran-
spires insordid alleyways, ramshackle tenements
and other dour locales. At the very least, Christo-
pher Nolanwouldbe wise, ifhe hopestopreserve
the series’ aesthetic, to portray Pittsburgh’s sleek,
inviting Golden Triangle sparingly.

All this underscores the fact that our city, if
Gotham-ized, will most likely not come across
asanice place. .

On the contrary, Batmar1’s habitat is one gov-
ernedbycorruption, violence andpoverty. Paired
with the smog-laden outer regions that set the
backdrop fortheﬁnalﬁgl1tin“Bat1nanBegins,” the
result might be something closer to 1920s Pitts-
burgh — not, as many would hope, a revamped
21st centmyPittsbu1gh. _ .

Finally, it shouldbe notedthatthe Steel Cityhas
anythingbutamonopoly onthethirdmovie’s set-
tingzplnadditionto Pittsburgh, I1VlDblistsRomania,
England and Los Angeles as ﬁlming locations.

Pittsburghers are right to hail the Batman
production as an economic boom: An invading
army of castand crewwill doubtlesslybeneﬁtlocal
businesses. The Chicago Tribune, infact, estimates
that the ﬁrst two ﬁlms spent more than $50 mil-
lion on “crews, vendors and hotels, among other
expenses” inchicago andasuccessful shoot might
attract ﬁirther big-name productions that are
equally enthused about our tax incentives. When
it comes to how our city’s image will ultimately
change, however, the answer is disheartening:
Either itwon’t, or it’ll be for the worse. I

FEATURE

Pirates look to attract ‘lost generation’

Gwen Barney‘

Senior Staff Writer A

The smack of a bat lumbering against

a baseball rumbles through PNC
Park. Pirates second baseman Neil
Walker steps in the’ path of a ground
ball hit by Colorado Rockies batter
Carlos Gonzalez.

Walker throws the basebal’ to-
ward second for what should b 3 an
easy out. But the toss falls short,
bouncing off the dirt and in the di-
rection of left ﬁeld. The error leads to
the ﬁrst two runs in the inning forthe
Rockies in what would become a 7-1
home opener loss for the Pirates.

Far above Walker, in the penul-

‘utimate row of the stadium, Pitt se-

nior Eve Bandi sits with her brother
Brian, 27, a Pitt alumnus. The pair is
relatively unfazed by the unfortu-
nate tum of events. They don’t yell
at Walker, stomp on their hats or spit
out every curse they can think of. It’s

just another mistake that willlead
to another loss in a string of losing
seasons.

“You kind of get used to that [los-
ing] feeling after a while,” Brian said.
“It’s not a surprise when they make
mistakes now.” -

The Bandi siblings are part of a
lost generation of Pirates fans. They
are too young to have hailed Roberto
Clemente calling, “Arriba! Arriba!” or
to have-seen Bill Mazeroski’s famous
ninth—inning heroics. At 22, Eve even
missed out on pre-watermelon—sized
head Barry Bonds swinging for the
Ohio River in 1992, the Pirates’ last
winning season. . .

It’s not that the Bandis don’twan

to care about whether or not the Pi-

rates win, it’s_that they don’t know ‘

how to care. -
That’s one of the reasons why
Brian Chiera might have the most

charged with making a lost generation of fans
care again and bringing the college-aged crowd
back aboard the Pirates’ ship.

“It is a huge market,” Chiera said of the
young adult age group. “It’s developing the
next generation of fans, so that once they have
disposable incomes, they will come to Pirates‘
games.” _

The problem with drawing young fans to

baseball is that the marketing must go beyond‘
simply discounting tickets. Whereas the Pen-

guins draw in the college crowd with their Stu-
dent Rush discount — which halves the price of
the cheapest arenaiseat — the cheapest seats
in PNC Park are already $9. _ 1
Instead of discounting tickets, Chiera and
his marketing team have to think more cre-
atively to bring students into their stadium.
One of their newest marketing-strategies in-
volves taking their product to the streets —

_ literally. Before every Friday home game this

season, The Pirates will host a block party on
Federal Street that includes food, games and
music. ' ' ‘

“It’s kind of a tailgating atmosphere geared
towards young adults,” Chiera said.

The Pirates are inﬁltrating campuses across
the city to spread word of their product, as well.
The team currently has Pirates ambassadors,

for a group of students willing to take on the
project during the summer semester. A
The Pirates are also using activities‘ inside
the stadium to draw the college crowd, includ-
ing ﬁreworks shows and hiring bands that are
popular among young adults. Chiera said that
the band 'I‘rain will play a post-game concert

on Aug. 6 in part to attract this younger audi-

ence.’

Some fans don’t buy into the bells-and-
whistles attempt to win them back.

“They’re just distracting you with all the
ﬁreworks and free stuff because they’re suck-
ing,” Pitt sophornore Tyler Crock said.

Chiera recognized that no matter how pop-

" ular the bands are or how many ﬁreworks the

Pirates set off, it’s difficult to bring fans into
the ballpark-if the team isn’t winning.

“The tough part is that a lot of it relates to
team performance,” Chiera said. 9

Pirates President Frank Coonelly agreed
that poor performances on the Pirates part in
the past have made it difficult to attractyoung
adult fans.

“We work really hard to engage all of our
potential fan base, and we have to work harder
than other clubs to engage that group.” Coo-
nelly said. ' '
