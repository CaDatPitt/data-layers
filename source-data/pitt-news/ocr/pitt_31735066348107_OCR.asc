Debate Continues

; On UAR Benefits

At SGB Meeting

BY BILL MOORE

Discussion continued over the
purposes and procedures. of the
Undergraduate Academic Review
(UAR) at Wednesday's Student
Government Board (SGB) meeting
when the board members dis-
agreed on whom the UAR is
designed to beneﬁt.

Board members Pat Kablach and
Paul Herneky contended the UAR’s
primary obligation is to “aid the
student in choosing courses.”

SGB president Mike Furick dis-
agreed. “The UAR is meant to
improve teaching by allowing in-
structors to gauge student reaction

to their courses,”, he said. K _,

,..._' .

   

among administrators, University
Senate committees and student
leaders requires the adoption of
codes and procedures dealing with
student responsibilities and corre-
sponding obligations of faculty
members.

“The policy is the ﬁrst of its kind
in a major university,” Posvar said.

 Structured Minors   Plan

Draws Adviser's Support

\

BY PETE BUTCH

Proposed structuring of depart-
mental minors drew general sup-
port Thursday from Advising Cen-
ter Director Frank Koloc.

“I think it’s ‘a good idea, a minor,
which should be related ti) a
student’s'rnajoror goals, gives the
student familiarity with a related
subject." P

The Student Cabinet of the Col-

A ‘ lege of Arts and Sciences [CAS]

agreed Monday to submit a pro-
posal to CAS Dean,Robert Marshal
to introduce structured
departmental minors into the
curriculum. A department would
be required to set aside certain
courses as prerequisites for a minor.
plus a certain number of electives.
A student and his major adviser
would choose the student’s minor
and pick from ‘these required
courses. ‘

“While a student needs 120
-credits to graduate orgy 30 credits
are directed towards a major,’ said
Kolac. “This leaves a student with
90 credits to play around with. A
minor would help students choose
classes around his subject area. It
would prevent haphazard course
choosing which usually causes a
lack of continuity in the students’
education,” Koloc said.

This scheduling of unrelated
courses causes the st).1dent confu-
sion and disillusionment with high-
er education. A student can sche-
dule a package of related courses
making his ‘education m_ore rele-
vant."

-Koloc said he was against pre-re-
quisites for minor subjects. “A
student must be able to choose
their own courses,” he said. “They
need ﬂexibility to be able to relate
to career plans. Minors would be
designed that go with today’s job
market. For example, we’ve found
that in today’s job market a

Computer Science minor goes best
with an Economics major.”
‘flt wouldn't be necessary to have

u

 

wlrustees Okay Integrity Policy

“It will dispense proper channels
for making decisions in academic
life and will lead to a higher degree
of responsibility on the parts of
both students and faculty.”

Posvar admitted some imperfec-
tions in the statement. “We’re
expecting a good deal of bugs in
the first year of operation,” he
said, “but all in all we’re very
pleased.” ‘ ' A
Board Chairman William Rea
requested a definition of “aca-
demic evaluation” as called for in
the statement, with the action to be
taken before the policy goes into
effect no later than January 1,
1975. _ , ,

Student Government Board Presi-
dent Mike Furick said afterward he
intends to purchase space in the
Pitt News for the full policy
statement.

Vice Chancellor of Business and
Finance Joseph Dutton reported
payment of a $27 million debt
incurred by the University in a
ﬁnancial crisis almost a decade
ago, is newly complete.

“As of April 1, 1976, the Univer-
sity can burn the mortgage on the
financial crisis of l966,” Dutton
said.

“It's ﬁtting that we put this
chapter to a close,” Posvar said.

Pitt Requests $7.3 Million,

From State Legislature

BY CAL RITCHEY
The University has requested an
extra $1.3 million in the form of a
“supplemental appropriation”
from the state legislature, accord-

‘ ing to Jack Freeman, vice chancel-
‘ lor of the Ofﬁce of Planning and

Budget.
The money, not included in the
$51.7 million the University receiv-

ed from the state last June, will be]

used to “cover inﬂationary costs
within the institution,” Freeman’
said. The appropriationbill is now
before the legislature.

“We are very hopeful that the bill
will be passed,” Freeman said.
“The regular appropriation has not
been sufﬁcient to cover our operat-
ing costs.” He noted that while the
University actually asked for $1.3
million, -the bill now before the
legislature seeks to allocate $1.5
million. ,

Much of the additional, money, if
granted, will be used for “physical
plant operations and mainten-
ance," according to Freeman.

“There’s been a tremendous es-
calation in energy costs,”. said
Physical Plant Director Hunt Mar-
tin. “The cost for steam, for
example has gone up 50% over last
year. .

“We weren't aware of the need V.
until after the original budget»?
request was made,” Martin said. 

“Since then, gas prices have risen‘
somewhat, and we’ve been us_iri

 

more electricity since we put those;

chillers in last year.” * _
Martin said extra funds would
allow some much needed repairs" on A
University buildings. “We’ve- got.
to do some important things like’

‘ roof repair,” he said.

“If we don’t get the money,."’..i
Freeman said, “we’ll just have to
pull in our belts another notch. Our
physical plant and maintenanc __
budget is already very austere.”_

 

Pitt’s request for additional mo
ney is “notiunusual” according «to,-
Freeman, although he was uncer. ,
tain whether the University ,ha"cl"'
been required to ask for extr
money last, year since he had not

then been involved in budget‘

problems. He pointed out -ma’
“Temple has received $2.5 million.
for their hospital and Penn Sta‘_te"1
has asked for $1.7 for their retire

Magic : Art for Everyman:

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

The smiling man on the stage
produced a long silver needle and
slipped it into his‘ forearm. The
point stuck out the other side.
Blood welled up around the point.
Then, still smiling, he tied a hemp
thread to the needle and drew the
string through his arm. Finally,
raising his eyebrows in concentra-
tion and gripping both endsof the

’ string, he ripped it out of his arm.

A short time later, the wound was
gone. Magic?

\ The same man stopped his heart
for the audience, produced cards
out of thin air, removed his thumb
and put it back again and ﬁred a lot

The UAR is funded by the Center
for Improvement of Teaching, who
asked the Board's recommenda-
tions for questions in future UAR
surveys.

Possible questions to be added to
or omitted were discussed by the
SGB with the uncertainty of pur-
pose of raising major differences of
opinion. ' '

Hertneky argued the question
“What grade do you expect from
this course?” should be omitted
because’ all students expect the
highest possible grade. “Do stu-
dents take courses they don’t
expect to do well in?” Hertneliy
asked the Board.

Furick answered that such infor-
mation was helpful to the instruc-
tor. .

Questions concerning how well a
student's grade reflects what was
learned and how well it reflects
what the student deserved were
also discussed.

Kablach motioned that the ques-
tion read: Did the teacher grade...
too easily, fairly, or too difficult-
ly?” Kablach’s motion was passed»
by the board.

The Board agreed to eliminate a
question asking if new or different
teaching methods were utilized in
the course. ‘‘It is the concensus of
the board that all new or different
teaching methods have been used
up by now," Furick explained.

As recently as the Fall of 1973, over
100 teaching slots occupied by the
graduate employees at Pitt -were
'wiped out. Those teachers were
utterly powerless to prevent it.

Only unionization can stop the
deterioratingjob security problem.

On the question of the governance
of the University, the Pitt Profes-
sional Union will seek some real
input into the decisions made here
on campus.- ~'l3he Pitt-‘News depicts
the unions as uniquely self inter-
ested, but all the editors would
have to do is take a look at the
composition of the Board of Trust-
ees and the top administrative
officers at Pitt and they would see
what special interest groups really
are. Work here for a while and
then decide just how much real
input the faculty have in decisions
that shape their careers, the lives
of students and the University as a
whole.

Finally, the Pitt News retreats into
that last refuge of management
when dealing with white collar
workers, the idea that unions are
OK for the masses, but you are too
“professional” for such working’

The Concept of the Major

BY ROBERT MARSHALL

Editor’s Note: ’ Due to printer’s
error the last paragraph of Dean
Marshall’s column, the second in a
series on the Liberal Arts,
appearing in Wednesday’s Pitt
News was eliminated. His column
today on the concept of the major
will include the eliminated para-
graph. _

I think that there is one ideal for
those two Liberal Arts institutions,

but that to accomplish it at a

university, there must be a vigilant
effort to keep the college's mission
,from being swallowed up in that of
the University. I believe the answer
to be purposeful and careful
defferenti-..tion,' variety, diversity
in faculty and program develop-
ment. ,
What I’m concerned about, then,

» in the defense.of the Liberal Arts

begun in the last issue is the
question of whether or not it fails to
work precisely because it has been
compromised from within.

Take, for example, the concept of
the major. In my judgment, the
idea of the major in a Liberal Arts
structure is that in the junior year.
after two years of general and
broad experience in a number of
areas of study, one chooses almost
casually and arbitrarily a particular
major only for the purpose of
having the experience of studying
something in depth and in detail, of
discovering not only how broad the
ranges of knowledge may be, but of
how interrelated and coherent, of
developing the skills involved in

detract from it. It is also foolish to
make a dichotomy a la Pitta News,
between bread-and-butter de-

_ mands and professionalism. How

long will quality teachers stay at a
school with low salaries, uncertain
tenure and lack of power to
participate in crucial decisons?

The Pitt News hints that students
will bear the burden of unioniza-
tion. We suggest that joint lights
can be waged for such questions as
no tuition hikes and better educa-
tional counseling and programs.
Pitt students will pay for the
absence by‘ a union of bigger
classed, declining faculty stan-
dards and uncertain and harassed
professors. It is unfortunate that

the Pitt News has chosen to echo,

the administration’s position so
faithfully. Mercifully, their opinion
is not shared by many students
here. ‘

Pitt Professional Union

the consistent, persistent, concen-
trated study of one subject area.-

The assumption is that the content
of any particular discipline is not
the focus of the major, but the
means to an end, the end being the
process of developing certain skills,
certainways of handling material,
certain sets of attitudes and values.

I think that our system has
developed a very contrary sense of
the major. Students largely seem
"convinced that they are choosing a
career when they choose a major. I
talked to several groups of students
last April on the eve of graduation.
A number of them admitted that
they had only recently become
aware that they weren’t about to
become psychologists ‘or political
scientists or sociologists.

I talked to many Freshman at’
June’s orientation. They already
feelguilty about not having a major
clearly in mind. They’ve been lying
to high school counselors since they
were freshmen in high school,
because they know they will be
considered aimless and immature if
they admit that they don't know
what they want to be.

Our application forms for Pitt ask
students to- indicate a possible

‘major. Our curriculum is encour-

aging people more and more to
major,-earlier and earlier.‘ The gaps
caused by the absence of require-
ments are being filled by expand-
ing requirements or co-requisites
or pre-requisites in some majors
(more on that later). A “faculty
member’ said to me, when I was
ranting about all this, that all this
may be true, but thatthe “mature
student" who knows what he wants
has rights, too.

See what I mean? Maturity is
knowing early what you want to do.
I submit that the Liberal Arts ideal
says that it isalso a sign of maturity
to be willing to put aside for awhile
the practical concerns of career and
to concentrate on developing one’s
potential as a full and rich and
liberal and humane person.

I'm a little bit concerned that this
will be ‘seen by those in the '
undergraduate professional schools
as a put-down. It isn't meant to be. _
We are a system that thrives on
variety. I am trying to suggest the
best way to foster‘ variety is for
each part to be as intent as possible
on pursuing the implications of its
own philosophy. That’s the way to
provide students true alternatives.
I don’t think the Liberal Arts school
is doing that.

As a matter of fact, in some ways
the professional schools are truer to
the Liberal Arts scheme, either by
postponing entrance into the
professional school until the junior
year (though'it must be granted
that in some cases much of these
first two years consists of pre-re- .
quisites) or by requiring a certain
amount of work in the Liberal Arts.
And I also want to grant the
obvious point that many who have

had earlier professional training
continue to grow and diversify and
become that 35-year-old who is
doing something creative and
productive in life. But I’ll bet that
person has also grown beyond the
limitations of the original skill.
My point, then, is that to a large
extent a misunderstanding of the
concept of the major has caused a
professionalization and pre-profes-
sionalization of the Liberal Arts.
From a somewhat different stand-
point, this identity problem of the
Liberal Arts schools is well
illustrated by the phenomenon of
the great body of pre-medical and

TA

pre-dental majors. There seems to _

be good reason to say that
something like 1000 of the 1840
freshman in CAS see themselves as
pre-med or pre-dent majors
[though we don’t actually have
such majors]. /That fact more than
any other dismays and puzzles me.
It dismays me because there is no
way these 1000 students have all
made that same choice for good
reasons (though many, of course,
have). I fear that many of them are
not asking these two‘ most
important questions for people of
their ages, ie, what do they like to
~ do and what are they good at, with

1%

‘\
.-.‘‘‘°k.-v;

the goal of putting these two'_

factors together someday some-
how. I

I fear they are letting external

"' factors, something in thevalues of

society and of parents or an anxiety

about career possibilities, make’

their decisions." The situation
puzzles me because I really don’t
know whatit means to be Dean of a
Liberal Arts school that has that
large a body of clearly intended
pre-professionals. I think’we have
at least two very different schools
going.

Please don’t see this as an attack
on pre-professional education ei-
ther. As I will suggest in a later
article, I am quite prepared to go
pre-professional and professional

completely on the undergraduate ‘

level, with- the liberal arts
re-identifying themselves purpose-
fully as what they have now
become -accidentally, i.e., suppor-
tive, supplementary,,and [I would
hope] subversive. I simply have
trouble with our being in some
senses very strictly Liberal Arts‘ [eg
strict observance of the rule that no
more than 12 credits may be taken

. outside of CAS,-or long debates in

CAS Council as to whether or not
Computer Science is too profes-
sional to be an undergraduate CAS
major] and in other senses very
vaguely Liberal Arts.) A

But, if I am prepared to abandon
the Liberal Arts ideal, it is because
it has already been abandoned. I
still believe in its value, but it is the
kind of thing that has to be done
very well to be done at all. If it ever



had a value for young people trying ‘

to grow and develop, it does now i
more than ever. We are apparently
headed in this country fora long
period of no growth. I don’t really
understand what that-means in
economic and sociological terms,
but I think that, in educational
terms, it means that we have to
teach people how to feel fulﬁlled
and rewarded in ways that don’t
depend on getting ahead or
climbing a ladder.. It means,
strangely enough, really deﬁning
and accepting the challenge of
liberating people, of making them

Zappa Review

I

Termed Tasteless

Dear Mr. Editor:

Ed Townshend, in his review of
“Roxy and Elsewhere" (Pitt News,
9/30/74), claims to know a lot
about Zappa as he dropped album
titles in his column like pigeons
dropping dirt in Schenley Plaza.
But, Ithink the pigeons know their

' shit better than Townshend knows

his. Anyone who has-heard the
“Hot’Rats” album, which Town-
shend describes as “tasteless,”
would realize that this album is .a
ﬁne, and, for the most part, an
unusually serious jazz work by a
group that has proven that they are
very capable jazz-rock musicians.

On “Hot Rats" and “Waka/
Jawaka,” Zappa makes no V
attempts at bizarre humor.‘ They

are the least commercial of Zappa’s
offerings and can't be categorized
with “Burnt Weenie Sandwich” or
his most recent albums.

But, of course, I haven’t ruled out
the possibility that Townshend
never heard “Hot Rats” and just
threw in the name to fill out column
space, sound authoritative or even

up the parallel structure in his’

classification of Zappa’s work. In
this case, Townshend is guilty of
irresponsible journalism. But in

any case, I can only advise him to
try butchering meat instead of the
Mothers. “Who you jivin’...”

Wasting Money

on New Pitt Logo

Dear Editor, /

It was with reserved awe that I

read the story concerning the
University’s new logo (Pitt News,
October 14) and the conditions
surrounding its institution. As was
stated in the article, many students
didn’t even know that a new logo
existed, much less that great sums
of money had been spent on it.
. The reasons cited for updating it
were to provide an identifying
symbol for the campus and because
the candle-within-the-shield logo
was “trite and simple” [which
means the administrative person-
nel got tired of looking at the same
letterhead over the years]. The
former reason isn’t totally ground-
less; however, it certainly is a
shame that it took two years of
research and in excess of $39,000
for a bunch of bozos in New York to
decide that the best way for a
design to be representative of the
University and the area was to use
part of the seal common to both the
City of Pittsburgh’s & Chatam
College’s seal.

 Lette rs to th e E d i to r

And now that it's been approved
and put into use, those employed
by Pitt don't really care that they
have a new logo, the students think
it looks like a gloriﬁed gas mask
and the designers got away without
really “designing” anything.

Couldn’t the money have been

better spent? '

First: it is unfortunate that
through literary devices like,
“Karen,...once that egg gets

distantly patronizing and holier-

some Pitt faculty members, either
because of good manners or

Second: in my opinion it is a

There was Nancy Ling Perry, a
highschool cheerleader who trans-
ferred from Whittier College to
Berkeley in 1966 to join the student
scene. In Patty Hearst’s words,
Perry was “wise and bad, and I’ll
always love her.” There was
Angela Atwood, Bill Harris, and
Emily, the sister from Chi Qmega

the ex-con Donald DeFreeze. And
there is Patricia Hearst.

Marilyn Baker dug out the facts of
the SLA step-by-step, making con-
tacts in the Berkeley underground
with the help of her son Jeff,
staking out suspected SLA retreats
by night, tracking down every lead
that could help spring the cobra
from its lair. The chase is thrilling,
gutsy, and when Baker is ham-

report the ﬁrestorm denouement in

story anyway, over the telephone
from policecontacts in LA and an

supplying Baker with on-scene

let him get away. Her story is a

he Patty Hearst kidnapping and
the story of the Symbionese Li-
beration Army will enter history as
one of the most bizarre chapters in

story. Staying on top of that story
for KQED-T V as the horror unfold-
ed, Marilyn Baker scooped the F BI,

tnedia; with her reports on the

membership of the SLA and pin-
pointing its -female leaders, and‘
reporting the names of the two men

who abducted Hearst—two months
before the FBI would conﬁrm her
report._

The target -of repeated death
threats from the SLA, as the

‘ journalist wrote her story a new

terror, a death poster from the
Black Liberation Army, appeared
on buildings in the San Francisco
area, demanding the immediate
execution of Marilyn Baker.

Yet Charles Bates, the FBI special
agent in charge of the Hearst case,
paid her the highest compliment a
journalist can receive: “I wish we

had that broad’s connections.”

Marilyn Baker is a woman of rare
and true courage. ‘

Baker, now 44, has been tracking
down news leads since she was 15,
working both print and electronic
reporting. Her brand of profes-
sionalism shuns “press conference
Journalism” and her investigative
reports have won her, among other
awards, the Medallion of Honor for
Outstanding Investigative Report-
ing from the National Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences, and a
citation from President Lyndon B.
Johnson.’ ~

She also lost journalism jobs, and
quit them, in her search for
editorial freedom, the freedom to
publish the information she col-
lected. “It's the competition,”
Baker says, ‘eyes flashing. “Ilove
it.”

There were many news stories,
including an ‘exposition of Black
Maﬁa operation in the Bay Area,
but it was the national notoriety of
the SLA that brought Baker job

offers from CBS and NBC and

naming of her own package with
San Francisco’s Group W affiliate
KPIX-TV.

fill it in—the editorial freedom is
what she had come for.

Courage, Baker says, paraphras-
ing, is not running from fear, but
standing your ground and facing it.

It was that kind of courage
implanted in her sons that brought
Jeff and Chris Baker to their
mother's home during the harass-
ment, waiting through the night
with riﬂes across their knees.

Asked if he had heard about the
amazing powers of Israeli psycho-

asked for a spoon. T

Geller is famous for his alleged

spoons by simply rubbing them

This gentle magician doesn’t do

such as sawing women into

He is satisfied with reproducing

A , BY BARB MUROCK
,“"Boycotts have a way of winding
down in the public’s mind. After
the initial appeal has subsided, it is
difficult to convince people their
ong-term support is still needed.
In-the summer of 1973, the United
Farm Workers (UFW) appealed to
theiAmerican public to participate
n‘ a nationwide boycott
‘on-union grapes and iceberg
ettuce.

The Pittsburgh faction of UFW,
"217" North Craig Street, has carried
_e’ front to Pittsburgh. The UFW
s” striking in opposition to labor
ontracts agreed upon by growers
and The Western Conference of
Teamsters, signed without the

ifarmworker.

. “Strikes and boycotts are our only
 on-violent tool in gaining justice,
ince farmworkers were excluded
;-from coverage under the Federal
labor Laws” said Sue Ardisson,
_ rganizer for the Pittsburgh United
~‘ "Farm Workers. House hearings in
4 972 on Migrant Manpower Pro-
-ceedings before the Subcommittee
 21 Agricultural Labor set an
{average annual income for a
farmworker family at $3350,
providing both parents and six
‘children were working, according
 the testimony of Assistant
‘Secretary of Labor Malcolm R.
_J2.ovell. Testimony from the US
»-‘Sen-ate Subcommittee of Migrant
v-Labor reveals that farmworkers live
in housing so substandard,‘it is
dangerous to health and safety.
The report went on to state that
imuch of this housing is operated on
gttproﬁt making basis.

Farrnworlters have a life expec-
tancy of 49 years, and death from
disease and accident are at léast
200% higher than the national rate,
according to the National Safety
Council.

The U? W is seeking secret ballot
elections of farmworker represen-
tatives to negotiate contracts with
the growers on their behalf.

“Through past experience,‘ the
UFW has found that striking,
combined with a boycott is the most
effective means by which growers
can be forced to negotiate with
farmworkers. The growers have
been forced to negotiate with farm
workers in the past because of
effective boycotting,” Ardisson
explained. '

She feels recent information has
led the public to believe that the
boycott is losing momentum, and
that people are not responding as
they had in the past.

Ardisson, however, claimed “The
UFW has firm support and the
boycott is very effective.” She said
recent information indicates the
number of carlots of lettuce being
shipped into Pittsburgh is currently
lower than the 1969 level, which
was shortly before the growers
negotiated with the Farmworkers.

The current boycott has been
endorsed and supported by reli-

gious groups, students and labor»

officials, including the AFL-CIO
Executive Council, the National
Council of Churches, the National
Conference of Catholic bishops and
the National Student Association.

In the past years some Pitt
students in support of the United
Farm Workers, expressed a desire

to have only union lettuce served in
the cafeteria, and the policy was
instituted because the administra-

tion felt’ enough students wanted .

the policy to warrant it. “Through
periodally checking the crates of
lettuce in the cafeteria this fall,”
Ardisson said, “students have
found no evidence «of non-union
brands being served.”

The Gallo family, according. to‘

Time magazine ﬁgures, owns a $40
million a year wine industry, which
produces more wine than any other
company in the world with

Pennsylvania as their largest- single
customer_. “_If all college students
would just boycott Gallo wines, and
drink something else, then the
cutback would be effective enough
to probably force Gallo to negotiate
with his workers. Currently, Gallo
controls 90% of the market of pop
wines, and also sells other wines
under many different labels.”

The Gallo name does not appear
on all labels of -the company’s
wines, but the Gallo Headquarters
of Modesto, California is a key to
identifying Gallo products. Gallo is
the only wine company operating
out of Modesto.

Support for the United Farm
Workers in the Pittsburgh area is
centralized at the North Craig
Street Ofﬁce. Organizers work
with Pittsburgh communities in
providing literature, holding lec-
tures and picketing local grocery

Double Elpee Review

   

Deia Vu for the Pocketbook

WALLS AND BRIDGES, John
Lennon, Apple (SW 3416) "

I bought John Lennon's new
album hoping it would answer for
me a now nearly-eternal question:
what the hell is John Lennon
doing? As a public ﬁgure, Lennon
has recently distinguished himself
in an uphill battle against the US
Immigration Service, as well as the
front lines at the Whiskey a Go-Go,
heckling the Smothers Brothers
and modeling the latest headwear
by Kotex. .

The past year also witnessed the
«dumping of Yoko Ono(surely a sign
of some sort) and out of this
collection of stresses and insanity I
was expecting a major out-pouring
of creative juices and truly tasty
new album from John.

This, of course, .. is not what
happened (never underestimate
the naivity of a Beatle-weaned
record reviewer). I still don’t know
what John Lennon is doing, and
unforturnately, neither does he.
Lennon has been plumbing the
depths of mediocrity ever since
Imagine, and is either too apathetic
or too "deteriorated to offer us
anything but more of the same.

Walls and Bridges does contain a
few bright spots, but for the most
part it ﬂuctuates between ponder-
ous, cliche-ridden confessions an_d
manic rock episodes with grafﬁtti-
like lyrics. “What You Got,”

“Beef Jerky” and “Surprise, Sur-
prise" ﬁt the latter category and
nothing much else could be said
about them. “Going Down "on
Love” has some nice intrumentals

but the lyrics sound like Ringo.

wrote them. “Old Dirt Road” has
some slick back-up vocals by Harry
Nilsson and «reminds me of a Van
Morrison song for a reason I can’t
pin-point (I think he stole part of
the melody from Van),

“#9 Dream” has a big, full sound,
spacy vocals (backed by “The 44th
Street Fairies”) and a foreign
chorus reminiscent of “Across the
Universe;” I don’t know what it’s
all about but it’s sort of growing on
me. My only othermajor criticism

 is the horrendous cover art, which I

E’? \

hope Lennon really did when he
was eleven.

Now for some of the bright spots:
first, it’s all produced and arrang-
ed rather nicelv, and Lennon's
friends, as always, play their
instruments well. Lennon at his
worst is still only mediocre; he
sings and screams as well as ever
and seems to have learned to

record his voice for ‘maximum V

 

effect. Finally, Walls and Bridges
contains a song called “Whatever
Gets You Through the Night”
which still sounds as good to me as
when I first heard it on the radio a
few weeks ago.

With Elton John on harmonies
and keyboards, it’s three minutes
and 20 seconds of crisp, high
energy pop music which may just
be enough to get withdrawing
Beatles addicts through‘ until the
next album. Maybe then we’ll find
out what Lennon is doing.

GOOD OLD BOYS, Randy New-I
man, Reprise [MS 2193]

“Yes baby I been drinkin’/And I
shouldn't comeby I know/ But I
found myself in trouble/And I had
nowhere else to go.” That’s the
first verse of “Guilty” one of the
finest songs from Randy Newman’s
latest album Good Old Boys. Don’t
spill any ‘beer on this one fans,
cause it’s gonna get some good
playing time. . \

Randy newman was inspired by
the Lestor Maddox incident on the
Cavett show in which the audience
and Cavett laughed at Lestor and
Lestor walked off and Randy
Newman...well he was outraged at
the fact that some Northemers had
had the nerve to laugh at a guy‘ who

was at least being honest...huh? So
went Randy Newman with the ol’
South in his heart from whence he
hails and wrote this here song. As a
matter of a face he had had the idea
of an album concerning the South
for a while...so now he’s unleashed
it. .
Good Old Boys marks a departure
from Newman’s previous records.
This LP is basically a thematic one
(or concept). Although his other
albums are ﬁlled with memorable
songs, their diversity in style and
subject matter make them more of
a collection. '
Earlier Newman songs fall into
several categories: strangely" funny
songs like “Political Science"
which urges the dropping of the
atomic bomb, pleasant nostalgic
songs like “Simon Smith” and the
“Amazing Dancing Bear,” com-
passionate songs like the one sung
to the dying “Old Man,” and songs
made famous by others such as
“Mama Told Me Not To Come”
(done tastelessly by Three Dog .
Night). '
Good 01’ Boys. Even the album
title conveys thesalbum’s uniform-
ity in content. It is about the South,
the past and the present. It’s about
Huey Long. It’s about drinking. A

I roller in a steel mill. “We drink too

much and we laugh too loud/We’ire
too dumb to make it in no northern
town” says the narrator in
“Rednecks.” His, affection for the
South and the common man blends
with his usual biting wit and
compassion. He even extends
himself in his sympathy to the
“Naked Man” who terrorizes the
streets. _ . E

friend/I just had to keep mov-

Football Fans Score

With “The Longest Yard"

BY M. C. PILECKI
Autumn can be the /most
nauseating season of the entire

year unless you’re one of those’

strange creatures who has pigskin
for hide. ' — .

Football season really overkills
the sport with high school, college,
NFC, AFC and WFL games
inundating the tube, the screen and
a lot of the conversation. And not
just the games, but pre-game
shows, post-game discussions and
even re-broadcasts of old games.

It’s.‘ enough to drive you right up
a wall, and very possibly into a
movie theatre to escape the
hailstorm of ﬂying footballs. Just
don’t go into a theatre that's
showing The Longest Yard. Yep,
it’s a football movie.

Actually, it’s not a bad ﬂick, and
would be rather enjoyable in the
spring, far from the current glut of
‘football. And Robert’ Aldrich,
probably the most brutal American
director with The Dirty Dozen and

Emperor of the North has toned-

down the gore enough so that
emetrol is not necessary for
watching this‘ ﬂick.

It’s still pretty gruesome, of
course, and if you’re one of those
anti-football persons who con-
demns the game as an empty
macho trip into mindless violence
played by amoral brutes, you’ll
love -this ﬂick for reinforcing all
your prejudices. The title is a pun,
of course, not only for the “longest
yard?" of the climactic football
game, but also for the prison yard
where much of the action takes
place.

Burt Reynolds stars as a Joe
Namath type (colorful quarterback
who was paid $10,000 once for
shaving off his mustache) who,

The movie is, in many senses, a
comedy on the American fanatici

who either loves the game or
despises it. Most of Reynold’s ‘lines
in the first half of the ﬁlm are‘,

Even. though he’s a former pro -‘

hundreds of years ago, let alone
within the decade. .

But, on the other hand the real,
unadulterated, home-grown and
alive and kicking’ Fleetwood Mac
proved what creativity does to the
right people. .

Minus the second guitarist they
have worked with throughout the
years, Fleetwood Mac (as proven
on their newest LP) Heroes Are
Hard To Find made a tremendous
showing to , quite a group of
loyalists...without going too far
back in‘ their music. The masterful
guitar work of Bob Welch and the

better than ever drumming of Mick

Fleetwood kept a voice in my other
ear saying "It sounds a lot like the
old band.”

Chris Vc Vies' vocals were as
tempting as ever, as was Welch’s
familiar" vocalizing. Adding the
bottom was John Mc Vie. And
believe it or not, if I've got it right
now, that makes it the real one plus
Doug Graves on additional key-
boards...no fakes. “The parallels
of Watergate, and you know who,
and our manager’s rip off is
amazingly similar,"~ Welch said
after the show. Throughout, the
performance he made references to

‘the counterfeit Mac put out last

Newman assumes the role of a
hoopie. Like “guilty’-”s broken
lover, some deal with personal
situations. “A Wedding in Chero-

Others deal with topics that are
political as well. Huey Long’s
“Every Man A King” is revived;
other songs are deliberately archaic

common man in the past for it’s
relevance to the present.

The first time you listen to
“Rednecks” you may hate it; You
may be offended. But this brave,
controversial song grows on you.
Newman shows that subtle racism,
of the North which imprisons the
blacks in ghettos is as insidious as
Southern racism which calls the
black a nigger (can you hear me
sweet home Alabama?).

“Guilty, baby, I’m’guiIty/And l’lI

together a team of a few guys who

Premier of Morris Work

Ends Weel<'s Concerts

The premiere performance of a
work by Robert Morris will be the
highlight of the second public
concert in the First Annual Collo-
quium for Contemporary Music.
The concert is scheduled for 8:30
pm, Oct. 18, in Carnegie Music
Hall. A i

The Colloquium is a week-long

residency of the Pittsburgh Sym-'

phony Chamber Orchestra, under
the direction of Donald Johanos.

Morris describes his composition’,
“Streams and Willows:  Concerto
for Flute and Orchestra,” as “an
exploration of the relationship of a
soloist to his accompaniment.”

Morris’ music is written’ for a
variety of forces and media, and of
late he has become interested in
composing pieces blending musical
styles from many different cultures
and historical periods.

The virtuosie’ flute solo in the
Morris composition will be per-
formed by Bernard Goldberg, prin-
cipal flutist with the Pittsburgh
Symphony since 1947. Thirty-
seven student instrumentalists

from the four participating schools

will perform with the 33 regular’

members of the Chamber Orche-
stra on the Morris piece.

The concert will include perfor-
mance of the composition which
won the 1973 BMI (Broadcast
Music, Inc.) Award to Student
Composers. The piece, “Ophelia
Diffusion,” was written by Roanld
Braunstcin while he was a student
a Carnegie-Mellon University.

The Chamber Orchestra also will
perform “Flos Campi” (The Flo-
wér of the Field), by Vaughan-Wil-
liams, and Ives’ Symphony No. 3,
“The Camp Meeting.” The
Vaughan-Williams composition
features a viola solo by Jerry
Horner, principal violist with the
Pittsburgh Symphony.

A Combined Colloquium Chorus
consisting of students from choirs
at Carnegie-Mellon, Pitt, and Du-
quesne also will appear in the
Vaughan-Williams piece. The
chorus is being prepared under the
direction of Donald Wilkins. .

manages to hold your interest.
Boredom is the cardinal sin of
movies, and one too prevalent
these days. Reynold’s role doesn't
call for much, and he’s quite good
at that, actually making a halfway
decent comic actor. He sort of
crumbles at the end when he has to
be dramatic, but by then the movie
picks up so much you don't even
care.

If you're a diehard football fan,
you might like this ﬂick for all the
action, and if you hate the sport,
you may still like The Longest Yard
for playing up all the game’s bad
points to your heart’s content.

. _ pretenses. _,_If~-he does,

 ‘(North Carolina two weeks ago. Nobody would admit it because those

men working in close situations, coaches and administrators alike,
don’t like to talk about it.

But it was an extra quiet Jackie Sherrill [Johny Majors’ defensive
coordinator] after the Tarheels gave his defensive unit the beating of
its life. Sherrill made no bones about it, he accepted the full

‘ responsibility for not preparing his players adequately. That was not

A. physical conditioning he was mournfully contemplating, it was his

squad’s mental attitude. _

a bad attitude, not cockiness, but not a fully positive perspective.
“Against Carolina we were looking for the big_play to be made,”

 Sherrill said. “Weneeded somebody to come up with the play to stop
 them and give us the momentum. We just didn't get it."

The offense, on the other hand, couldn’t do much against USC in the

 .15 minutes of possession, but came through against the Tarheels in

fine fashion. Twenty~nine points is certainly enough to win a ball game
and the members of the offensive unit couldn’t help but wonder despite

.. Majors’ constant reminders that every win or loss is a team effort.
. Coaches always say that.

The problem might have been called dissension, if anybody is radical
enough to think that way. lfd prefer to call it a lack of communication.
That’s what Majors and his assistants felt it was and promptly
administered the remedy shortly after that “ass-whipping” in North
Carolina.

The following Monday, the start of practices for the West Virginia
game, Majors sat his team down and had what might be termed a frank
conversation session, player to player with the coaches monitoring.

 What resulted was the exchange of personal feelings, opinions of what

was wrong, why the Carolina game was lost, or who wasn’t doing his
part.

Yes, even Tony Dorsett admitted he wasn’t running up to par through
the first four games. The offense got gripes held against its defensive
team mates off its chest and vice versa. '

And last weekend against West Virginia, both squads exhibited the
effects of Majors therapy with a total team "effort, a total team victory.
True, West Virginia is not North Carolina, but the rivalry involved
made up the difference. '

Majors has spewn his realistic and often pessimistic southern drawl
all along, knowing well the potential the Panthers possess. Now he’s

 faced with another opponent, Boston College, whose caliber lies

somewhere in that mythical Eastern category, as does West Virginia’s.

In fact, the next four games, BC, Navy, Syracuse and Temple, all fall
into that “Pitt will definitely be the favorite” category. You may
recall, the Cats were given the nod over the Tarheels, carting a 2-1
slate" into the game.

And with Notre Dame and Penn State representing quite a jump in
scheduled caliber, it will be tough for Majors to keep his players
concentrating through the middle of those four games. There are a lot
of people around. including team-members, who_can’t wait till Joe
Paternocomes to town. '

But, as Sherrill put it rather bluntly, “North Carolina taught us never
to look past anybody.”

The aspect of what the rest of the season holds for the Panthers has
changed for those who had rosy visions of an 8-3 or even 9-2 season.
For Pitt to remain immune to the rash of upsets that have paced the
season wasn’t realistic thinking.

“You always hope to go to a bowl game,” Gary Burley said, smiling
after the WVU game, “but now we just want to win. Winning,
recognition, the Lambert Trophy; those would have to be my goals
right now.” .

It's only‘ natural and logical that one follows the other.

\The loss to North Carolina had to_ set the Panthers back on their
timetable of progress. Their return to rehabilitation began in the
second half against the Mountaineers. Pitt will need every one of those

_ four “easy” "opponents to get it together for Ara Parseighan and

teams would certainly bring the top
honors back to Pitt.

The game deciding who will
capture the Lambert Trophy could
easily be Pitt’s ﬁnal game of the
season, against Penn State. But
Pitt will have to get by some
stubborn opponents before then,
especially tomorrow when Boston
College in‘vades Pitt Stadium.

The eagles have been improving
steadily after being trounced in
their opening two games by Texas
and Temple. They have come on in
the last two weeks to overpower

, Navy and William & Mary, not

exactly powerhouses but teams
who were nonetheless outclassed
by the Eagles.

Nevertheless, Boston College will
come to Pittsburgh ready to play
and Majors had quite a bit of praise

for the Eagles, although praising,

his opponents seems to be standard
Major’s procedure.

“We will see a well coached
football team,” said Majors. “I
have a lot of respect for Joe Yukika
(BC head coach). They have one of
the best offensive lines we’ll face.

MIKE ESPOSITO, Boston College’s 1000-yard runner, executes a
successful end sweep. Esposito suffered a knee injury last Saturday
after gaining 71 yards in the first quarter. He is expected to be ready

for tomorrow’s game. .

Their size and strength compares
favorably with Southern Cal, Notre
Dame, and Penn State.”

The anchor of the BC front line is
6-5-, 265 pound Al Krevis. Many
consider him to be better than any
of the six Eagle offensive lineman
who signed pro contracts at the end
of last season. Krevis had consis-
tently dominated his defensive
opponents and Majors landed him
highly.

I M C To make a mistake in the world of
sports is one thing. To cost your
team a victory is quite another. On
Friday afternoon, Nick Martin
walked (or should we say ran) on
that tenuous ground between
winning and losing. The danger
luckily enough was never really
there for his coach, and his team as
the Pitt cross-countrymen, led by
Mel Boyd, crushed WVU, 24-33.

“I have had bad luck before and
today was no exception,” ex-
plained Martin. Luck indeed had
run out on Nick as he took a wrong
turn with a quarter mile to go in the

 six miles race.

from a sure victory to a third place

efforts of freshman Mel Boyd and
vastly improved Dave McDonald.

both said they had planned to “go

completion mark, for 401 yards and
three touchdowns. However, he
has thrown six interceptions.

An important facet of the BC
scoring attack is the foot of Fred
Steinfort who has kicked two
50-yard field goals during the past
two weeks. He is four for ﬁve in
the field goal kicking department
and is eight for nine in extra point
attempts. V

Unfortunately for the Eagles, the
quality of their defense is not what
Coach Yukika would like it to be.
They have given up 92 points so far
this season although they did earn
a shutout against Navy.

The Eagles have three returning
starters from last year’s from four.
Tackles Steve Turner and Pete
Cronan anchor the front backed up
by three veteran linebackers head-
ed by All East award winner Alex
MacLellan.

BY YAIER LEHRER .

Pitt fans marvelled last Saturday
as a blue streak blew past a lone
West Virginia defender to haul in a
41-yard Bill Daniels pass and break
the game open, giving the Panthers
a 24-14 lead.

The “blue streak” was Karl
Farmer and the play was definitely
no fluke. As a matter of fact, that
same scenario ‘may become more
and more familiar in the near
future as the Panthers rediscover
the passing game and take advan-
tage of their newest offensive
weapon in the form of the Daniels-
Farmer pass combination.

Farmer has caught 12 passes for
152 yards‘ and three touchdowns,
10 of those receptions coming in
the last two games. He has already
caught as many touchdown passes
as Daniels threw all of last year, "an
indication the Cats will be going to
the air a lot more, probably to
Farmer.

“Daniels tried that same play in
the first half, but overthrew me,"
said the speedy junior college
transfer. “'1 know that I can beat
my man on a streak two times out
of three, and if the ball is where it’s
supposed to be. I'll catch it."

Farmer relies primarily on his
speed, and for good reason. He is a
world class sprinter with a list of
accomplishments as long as Lucius
Keese’s arm. He was the National
Junior College champion in the
440, and second only to Maurice
Peoples in the National AAU 440. .
His time was the ﬁfth fastest in the
world.

His football accomplishments are
no less impressive. In his freshman
year at Southwest Los Angeles
Junior College, Farmer caught 36
passes, and was an outstanding
punt and kickoff return specialist.
A collarbone injury sidelined him
after three games last 'year, but
until that time he had been leading
the state in scoring. Farmer is also
here to run track, and should have
a stellar year. There's just one
hitch to this double participation. -

Karl Farmer does not like track.

“I started running in high school
to prove a point to someone,”
Farmer claimed, “and I’ve been
running ever since.”

KARL FARMER has added a whole new facet to the Panther offensive
attack reviving the shacky passing’ /game. Farmer has caught 12 passes
so far this season including a 41-yarder against WVU. '

His only reason for staying with
track is to prove just one more
point.

“I want to run in the 1976
Olympics," he said. “i think I can
break‘the‘world’s record. After that
I'll hang it up.”_

The belief in his own ability is a
result of confidence, not cockiness.
Farmer recently won the Los
Angeles Times 500 sprint with a
time one second off the world’s
record. .

“I'd never run the 500 sprint
before," he says, “and I really
didn't know what I was doing. I just
ran."

Although the type of football
played at Pitt is a lot different from
the game Farmer is used to, his
attitude still exudes enough of the
same confidence to make himself
believe he is a possibility for
All-American honors.

“In junior college, I never had to
do any downfield blocking,” said
Farmer. “At Pitt, the game is
completely different, with a lot
more blocking, but if they keep on
throwing. the ball to me, I think I

,-

have a chance to be an All-Ameri-
can.” b

The fine line between cockiness
and conﬁdence in one’s oivn ability
is one that Farmer is quite aware
of, but has _not crossed, yet.

“I've made some good accom-
plishments in both football and
track and haven’t gotten a swelled
head yet,” Farmer said. “IfI make
All-American‘, I might get a swelled
head, but the swelling will come
down before the beginning of next
season."

The season looks good so far for
the Daniels-Farmer combination,
and if the passing- attack can
succeed, not only will the Panthers
gain a lot of yards through the air,
but they will take a lot of the
pressure off tailback, Tony Dorsett.
Defenses won’t be able to key on
him" so rigidly, thereby springing
him forlonger gains.

Fiat Doesn't Finish

It was a win, but a loss. orjust not
a total victory. But anyway you look
at it, Tome Bakin-is still happy.

Bakin, behind the wheel of the
Pitt Road R_acing -Team's Fiat 124,
posted the top qualifying time in
last Saturday’s run at Nelson
Ledges, Ohio, but blew a tire in
Sunday’s race to settle for third
place.

At the start of the qualifiers,
Bakin was in"third position, but
grabbed the lead over Bill Mur-

ing the Fiat in front of Murray,
Bakin used a new strategy obtained
from his previous runs at Nelsen
Ledges over the summer.

He led all the way,_ manuevering
out and eventually around
slower cars he lapped. The check-
ered flag was only the second Bakin

and the Pitt Crew had ever seen..

They went into Sunday’s run well
prepared and “high” on‘ pure
optimism and pleasure. '

I Saturday's qualifying trophy gave-A
‘Bakin the pole position, and he

used it well, taking off from the

him a complete sweep on the
weekent. ’

Bakin turned seven laps still
holding the lead but spun out in the
carousel and dropped to _sixth ‘by
the time he pulled back on the
track. Marking a 1:32.] lap, his
fastest of the day, Bakin was
making time on the pack and just
five seconds behind the leaders
when he was side-swiped by a car
comingout of the pits, sending him

spinning into the carousel turn.‘
For Bakin, the qualiﬁers trophy
would have to do. But it was
another race under his belt, more
experience gained. And as Bill
Heddinger said last August after
barely edging Bakin at Nelson
Ledges,“One of these days Tom’s
going to find out what he can really
do, and when he does, he’s going
to be one man that's hard to keep
out of the top places.” ' '
