Pitt safety dismissed from team

Liz Navratil
Editor in chief

Jeff Knox, a Pitt safety who was dismissed
from the football team last week, has been
accused of disorderly conduct, simple as-
sault and recklessly endangering another
person.

A complaint ﬁled in Pittsburgh Municipal
Court says Knox, 18, assaulted a woman who
told him she was pregnant.

Chatham University and city police re-
sponded to Chatham University’s Fickes Hall
Wednesday for a report of a man choking a
woman. ‘ S '" ‘

Police found a woman sitting on a porch
crying outside the residence hall. The woman
told police that after she told Knox she'was

pregnant, the two yelled expletives at each
other. Knox then told the victim, “I hope
you try to f***ing hit me,” according to the
complaint. ' L

The two continued to yell at each other,
and then the victim tried to hit Knox. The

victim told police Knox then slapped her in .
the head with an open hand, “with such_force a

that she was thrown to the ground,” according
to the complaint.

The document says Knox then jumped on
the victim, grabbed her by the throat, picked
her up by the throat and slammed her head
into the wall, where he held her and continued

to choke her. v

Knox then ﬂed the scene, according to
the report. i

Knox could not immediately be reached

for comment, and spokespeople for the Ath-
letic Department declined to comment be—
yond the Statement announcing his dismissal
last week. i

Knox is the fourth football player to have
a run—in with police sincejuly. Defensive end
Jabaal Sheard pleaded guilty to disorderly
conduct after ajuly incident in the South Side,
and has been reinstated to the team.

Running back Jason Douglas is currently
on suspension after he was arrested earlier
this month and charged with driving under
the inﬂuence. Offensive lineman Keith Cole-
man is also on suspension after police charged
him with aggravated assault and disorderly
conduct. a 4 » T

The Pitt
News

celebrates

100 years

Liz Navratil
Editor in chief

For a century now, Pitt students have
skipped class, deprived themselves of sleep
and hustled to make deadlines so they could
provide you with the University’s news.

The Pitt News marked the 100th anni-
versary of its debut issue yesterday and will
hold a formal celebration during homecom-
ing weekend next month.

i The paper premiered as The Pitt Weekly
on Sept. 26, 1910. News that day included a
note suggesting freshmen “learn the foot-
ball yells as soon as possible” and advising
students that the Engineering and Mines
building had been renamed Thaw Hall and
State Hall, a change that “is much more
digniﬁed and is a ﬁtting ‘compliment to a
staunch admirer of the University.”

The paper produced an issue once aweek
until Sept. 20, 1932, when students woke up
to a newspaper called The Pitt ?????. Twice-
weekly publication began that year, but the
staff didn’t know what to call the paper.
So they held a contest in which students
competed to name it. ' -

“The Board has named, named and re-
named, but to no avail  a name signiﬁcant
of the semi-weekly has failed to appear out
of the maze of suggested titles and names,”
the staff wrote when it announced the con—'
test. . .

won $10, the equivalent of about $160 to-
day, when he submitted the winning name:
The Pitt News. V

The paper gradually began producing is-
sues more frequently and went daily in 1997,,
when it began producing the Impulse weekly
entertainment magazine on Fridays. Impulse
won the highest award in the prestigious
Associated Collegiate Press’s Pacemaker
competition. ’

In November 1999, it dropped the maga-
zine and began producing a more traditional
Friday issue in an effort to produce “in-depth
news, exciting sports and provocative opin-
ions ﬁve days a week.” '

Around the same time, The Pitt News .

began a ﬁve-year legal battle that would
eventually win the paper back its right to
publish ads for alcohol, which the paper
had done for many years before a 1996 state

3 law banned it. The paper argued that a state

ban on alcohol advertisements in college
publications violated its First Amendment
rights. a

“The issue was whether the government
can make it a crime to publish information,”
Vic Walczak, an American Civil Liberties

' Union attorney representing the paper, said .

at the time.

The Pitt News set a precedent. again last
year when it used the social media site Twit-
.ter to break news about the G—20 Summit,
outpacing professional papers such as the

Sweetlgets shady
with corn sugar

Reading ingredient lists is a good step in
the right direction toward eating healthy.
That is, until groups try to change the
names of their unhealthy ingredients to
appeal to consumers. _

The Corn Reﬁners Association applied
to the Food and Drug Administration this
month to change the name of high—fructose
corn syrup to’“corn sugar.” -

Audrae Erickson, president of the CRA,
said the purpose of the new name is to help
people understand the sweetener, accord-
ing to the Associated Press.

More likely, the CRA is responding to a
drop in high—fructose corn syrup (HFCS)
consumption, which is down 21 percent
from 10 years ago, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. » ‘

A study conducted at Princeton in
Marchof this year showed that “rats with
access to high-fructose corn syrup gained
signiﬁcantly more weight than those with
access to table sugar, ‘even when their over-
all caloric intake was the same.”

While the HFCS’s name change has not
yet been approved and could take up to two
years, the industry is already" using the
phrase “corn sugar” in its new marketing
campaign._ Perhaps you’ve seen the new
commercials that say “whether»it’s corn
sugar or cane sugar, your body can’t tell
the difference. Sugar is sugar.”

Not according to the Princeton study.
While sucrose is composed of 50‘percent
fructose and 50 percent glucose, the typi-
cal HFCS contains 55 percent fructose,
42 percent glucose and 3 percent higher
saccharides._Inladdition, the fructose
molecules in regular sugar are bound and
require an extra metabolic step before

unbound and ready for instant absorption,
says Princeton. _

The Associated ‘Press reports that
“Americans are increasingly blaming high-
fructose corn syrup and avoiding it.” In
addition, many companies such as Sara
Lee, Gatorade and Snapple have switched
from HFCS to sugar in their products.

It is very clear that the Corn Reﬁners
Association is attempting to throw away a
name with a negative association in favor
for a new, more innocent-sounding label.
And unfortunately, we think consumers
will fall for it.

Renaming products has been successful
in the past. “‘Low-erucic acid rapeseed oil’
became much more popular after becom-
ing ‘canola oil’ in 1988. Prunes tried to
shed a stodgy _image by becoming ‘driéd
plums’ in 2000,” according to the Associ-
ated Press. . - 7 V

College students are already in an un-
healthy environment without the CRA
attempting to deceive them with ingredi-
ent labeling. Students are also vulnerable
because they often have to buy what is
readily available to them. Because of this,

"we would like Pitt studentsfto be wise of

the potential name change, just in case
the FDA permits this sort of deceptive
marketing.

Students should also keep in mind that
sugaris no saint either. Keeping your sweet
tooth in control will deﬁnitely help in keep-
ing college weight off. While we hope that
your future husband or wife will like you

for things like your personality and your .

super sexy Pitt education and not just your
rockin’ hard bod, it deﬁnitely doesn’t hurt
to look good naked, nor does it hurt, in the

Scramble for Chicago

Columnist

 

. There is something to be said for getting
to know someone well. Sure, you can go

and party and have a good time with people .

you see for maybe three hours every week.
However, is there not also a pleasure in
getting to know someone thoroughly?
Eventually, this leads two bodies to ex-
treme familiarity, and one friend can of-
ten predict what the other is going to do.

The two become, in a sense, joined at the I

hip. ,

The 21 years Richard M. Daley has
ruled Chicago have given the residents
of Cook County plenty of time to get to
know all of his idiosyncrasies, from his

to'do? Take my pants off?” to “Go scruti-
nize yourself! I get scrootened every day,
don’t worry, from each and every one of
you. It doesn’t bother me.”_Those 21 years
have also let everyone in Cook County get
comfortable with him running the show
— until recently. With irritation rising
at high parking—meter rates, taxes and
everything. else plaguing Chicago, Mayor
Daley decided not to run for re—election,
triggering a scramble in the political world
that has not been seen since the last time
an incumbent mayor wasn’t in the mix in
Chicago, way back in 1947. In this second

LEX AND THE CITY

Lexie Bond

Assistant Opinions Editor.

I’m a health and ﬁtness blogger. On an
almost daily basis, I read, research, Tweet
and blog about health and ﬁtness. But
sometimes, I don’t necessarily “live”
health and ﬁtness.

You see, while I am a health and
fitness blogger, I also somehow fre-
quently find myself- at buffets.
I’m picturing your expression right now. I
looked that surprised once. Then again, I
had overarched my eyebrows while tweez-
ing.

Moving on.

~ A buffet sounds like a health conscious
person’s worst nightmare, right? The con-
cept of the buffet basically spits in the
face of eating sensibly and in moderation.
So this summer, when I somehow found
myself at a buffet on more than a dozen
occasions, I decided I was going to have
to ﬁnd a way to keep gluttony at bay at an
all-you-can-eat establishment. S

Therefore, I’ve developed a few steps
on how to eat healthy at a buffet.

Step 1: Don’t go to a buffet.

There are very few reasons to go to a
buffet. One of them being that many buf-
fets are Chinese. For some reason, Chinese
buffets rise above the rest, offering buffet-
priced, all-you-can—eat delights that are
still extremely high quality.

The only other circumstance warrant-
ing your presence and participation at a

buffet would be that your boyfriend made '

you go. All good girlfriends accompany
their boyfriends to buffets. Other than
that, the only “good” thing about a buffet
is the high quantity "of a variety of foods.
If those dishes were high quality, I’d be in
heaven. But most buffets remind me more
of a trough full of slop for human pigs.

Step 2: Wear tight clothes.

Observe Golden Corral’s dinner crowd
and notice their apparel. As much as I

ﬁtting clothes, you will be more conscious
of your body and what you put in it. With

every bite, you’ll be aware of how snug"

your clothes are on your body. Being in this
state of slight discomfort should keep you
from gorging yourself. Now I’m not say-
ing you should show up to Golden Corral
in your favorite little black dress. Skinny
jeans should do the trick just ﬁne.
Step 3: Drink water.

“Eating a high amount of low-calorie.
  foods like vegetables is a satisfying Way

to eat a lot and feel satiated Without be-

coming pregnant With a food baby. ”

know you’re probably thinking that adults
should not wear Tweety Bird shirts and
that you haven’t seen this many mullets
since your last country music concert,
let’s concentrate on what’s below the
waist. Pants, perverts, pants. Other than
the always fashionable stretch pants com-
plete with stirrups, you’ll notice that the
tautness of most people’s jeans is enough
to create a nice shelf of belly fat. I’m imag-
ining that overtweezed—eyebrow expres-
sion again when I tell you that we can learn
something from these Harley—Davidson-
T—shirt—wearing—people. By wearing form-

No need to start wasting precious calo-
ries on what you drink. Look at it this
way: If you were allotted 250 calories, you
could either drink a Pepsi and eat noth-
ing, or you could wash down a reasonably
sized piece of cheesecakeewith some water.
Which would you rather have? I for one
would probably choose cheesecake over
sex, unless I hadn’t worked out yet that
day, in which case.I’d have sex so that I
could justify it as a workout. Actually no,
I’d still probably choose cheesecake.

Step 4: Eat your greens.

Starting off withva salad is a great way

Is all-you-can-eatan invitation to be unhealthy?

to make sure you don’t overdo it on more
calorie-dense foods. Eating a high amount
of low—calorie‘foods like vegetables is a

' satisfying way to eat a lot and feel satiated

without becoming pregnant with a food
baby. I will warn you though, vegetables at
buffets are notoriously disgusting, likely
because more love is put into the fried
chicken and macaroni and cheese. But it’s
your fault.for being at a buffet to begin
with. Or your boyfriend’s. '

Step 5: Get your money’s worth.

There’s no point in shelling out $10 or
$12 to go to a buffet if you’re not going to

Daley’s replacement can take his seat, but not his crown

Kozlowski< 5

sede vacante in an ofﬁce that had been
considered, in Daley’s case at least, his
position for life. The candidates and po-

' tential candidates are far—ranging, from

Alderman Brendan Reilly of the upscale
42nd Ward; to U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-

111. 4th District), perpetual self-appointed .

Latino spokesman; to Miguel del Valle, city
clerk; to White House Chief of Staff Rahm
Emanuel; to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart;
and possibly U.S. Rep.Jesse]ackson]r. (D-
111 2nd District). Oprah Winfrey is about
the only prominent Chicagoan somebody
hasn’t suggested is running for mayor, but
with The Oprah Winfrey Show winding
down this year, who knows?

Each of the seriously discussed candi-
dates has his or her own advantages and
disadvantages, and in the case of a three-
way race we could see Chicago’s large po-
litical blocs collide with each other.

‘Personally, I think the next mayor of

Chicago is going to be black. Why? The"

last time we had a lively three—way race
was 1983, which resulted in the white vote

being split and Harold Washington win- '
ning the mayor’s ofﬁce, making him the_

first black man to do so.

This time, my hunch is that we end
up with a Latino candidate splitting the
North Side votes with Emanuel or Bren-
dan Reilly, the Southwest Side votes going
to Tom Dart — leaving the city’s blacks
the only undivided constituency. At 36.8
percent of the city according to -the U.S.
Census Bureau, this makes the black vote
decisive. '

‘ Who can deliver it? I’m guessing state
Sen. Rev._]ames Meeks, who has the politi-
cal organization and likely the support of
black churches. So, Meeks will either be
mayor, or kingmaker.

This election is also likely to mark the
end of the era when one person was able

to wield political power for so long. Daley
was able to remain mayor partly through
deft control of patronage, p_artly through
lack of serious candidates in opposition,
and partly by maintaining political or-
ganizations in each of the major ethnic
groups of the city.

The next mayor will inherit few of these
advantages. With the city bankrupt and
a federal prosecutor that has convicted

‘prominent Daley aides, candidates now

have little money to spread around and
strong incentives not to try too much
funny business. . V
Political organizations will likely be
in disarray following this election. There
will be groups set up to deliver the votes
of certain voting blocs for one candidate
or another, none of which will be keen on
going away or helping the eventual mayor
when all the shouting is over. With the
less oﬁpplitical 12a.t1r°nage.t.he 1.16.“: maxor

.Wr.it.es.k9z.th°ugbt@gmail:c9m.!

will have little available to persuade these
political groups to simply desist.

So, instead of one city Democratic Ma-
chine running the show from City Hall,
you will have several that might see more
to gain by remaining in opposition and
working for the overthrow of the mayor
rather than serving docilely and taking
what little the mayor can offer them.

With so many candidates entering the
race, we see that there are enough people
in Chicago interested in the position to
make it less secure.

It also suggests that the mayor hasn’t
been able to anoint a successor of some
kind, knocking the idle ‘speculators aside.
If Daley can’t do this now, future mayors

won’t be able to either. “The City That _, _

Works” is hard at work ﬁnding a new
mayor. But this time, he won’t be king.

Wandering through the “DIY: A Revolu-

an explorer’s eyes are met with a brightly

In their works ranging from bikes made out

creators have combined usefulness and art

Each piece has its own meaning. Red-
wood’s “Dumponaut” is what he describes as
an “urban Winnebago”. It’s a Dumpster that
has been converted to include seating and

“[I wanted to prove that I] could make

_ Andy Tybout
Assistant A6'E Editor

When it comes to movie reviews, who will
critique the critics?

Whilewatching a trailer for upcoming
Facebook ﬂick “The Social Network,” in
which quotes of praise ﬂare up every three
seconds, I was struck by a notion both
revelatory and obvious: Not all critical en-
dorsements should carry the same weight.
A stamp of approval from Fox News is
not the same as a thumbs—up from Roger

‘Ebert.

In short, all critics are not equal.

With this resolution-in mind, I set out to
give movie reviewers a taste of their own
medicine: I reviewed them. Below, you’ll
find my judgments on ﬁve film pundits
~— conveyed, I hope, with the acumen of
Leonard Maltin.

Roger Ebert/The Chicago Sun-Times:
B+

Ebert possesses that most essential qual-
ity of critics: passion. Whether or not you
agree with his endorsements -.—— I know I
don’t always -— you have to ‘acknowledge
that Ebert’s in the right profession. And
while you may furrow your brow at some
of his judgments, you’d be hard—pressed
to keep from giggling at his zingers.
Unfortunately, I can’t appreciate some
of his play calling. Unlike most critics,
Ebert seems to judge ﬁlms by what they
strive for, rather than whether they actu-
ally succeed. This leads him to bestow--his
stamp of approval upon some ambitious
but truly wretched movies — see “Know-

ing” and “W.” Thankfully, roughly four _

times out of five, Ebert’s keen intellect
does him, and his fans, justice.

MOVIE REVIEW

lWorse than your first time

Anna Weldon
Stajfwri ter

“The Virginity Hit” .
Starring Matt Bennett and Zack Pearlman
Directed by Huck Botko and Andrew Gur-
land . '
Grade: B

Losing your virginity is never simple, but when
a series of bizarre and. unforttmate circum-
stances are thrown into the mix — a cheat-
ing girlfriend, a group of nosy friends and a
hermaphroditic blow—up doll — things really
get complicated. ’

Such is the case in “The Virginity Hit,”
which explores one teenage boy’s quest to lose
his virginity and the obstacles in his way. Direc-
tors Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland team up
to dramatize an already awkward situation and
make it completely absurd — in a totally funny

. way. Though the ﬁlm doesn’t hold back on of-
fensive language or illegal activity, its vulgarity
only serves to further propel the humor.

The movie follows Matt, ateenage boy who
is the last among his friends to cash in his v-
card. Whether he’s getting thrown into a bush

4 v by his girlfriend’s dad or stealing a Ralph Lau-

ren Black Label suit, Matt’s journey is anything
but the traditional ﬁimbling-for-a-condom
process. '
Referenced in -the movie title, Matt and
Zack— Matt’s adopted brother and bestfriend
—— share a virginity-losing ritual with their
friends. After each one does the deed, they
light their red “virginity bong” — obviously
shaped like a woman — and take a hit, How-

ever, Matt is the only virgin left and Zack is
determined to get him to bed his girlfriend of
two years, Nicole.

Unfortunately for our protagonist, _his -

girlfriend cheats on him one night at a party
before they can have sex. In an effort to seek ‘
revenge, Matt and his friends decide to tape.

~ their ﬁrst time, but Matt’s conscience gets in

the way and he ends up with a video of her
furious father hurling him into bushes that
inevitably goes viral. "

' As if the situation weren’t complex enough,

. the boys manage to muddle it all more. As ‘
Matt falls further into shame, Zack continues

with his Well-intentioned antics that serve to
worsen the situation. The duo — comparable
to Seth and Evan of “Superba ” — manages
to pull out ofbad situations and keep the audi-
ence laughing. '
Though it’s pegged as a comedy and most

’ of the movie will make you laugh, some senti-

mental moments inhibit the ongoing humor.
Matt and his father’s poor relationship and
his mother’s earlier death are totally sober-
ing. It gives you the feeling that this kid just
can’t catch abreak. These moments obviously
stall the pace of the movie’s humor — it’s just
fortunate that with a few bottles of liquor, the
boys manage to reclaim their mission and bring
the movie back to a quick clip.

. “The Virginity Hit,” like many coming—of-
age comedies, employs the predictable charac-
terizations of horny teenage boys. Fortunately,
the likeability of the characters endears them
enough toyovercome the typicality.

Matt’s sexless life will intrigue the audi-
ence and make losing it even more random
than before. I

T ybout graduates at the top-of the critics’ class

Tybout 4 7

Do you enjoy having your favorite films
razed by a man who speaks of the Zeitgeist
and media—savvy like a street preacher on
acid? Armond White may fit your fancy.
For the rest of us, however, he’s a most
unfathomable reviewer, eviscerating cer-
tiﬁably good ﬁlms — “District 9,” for in-
stance —— while exalting stink bombs like
“Norbit.” This might be forgivable if he
made judgments within a clearly deﬁned
modus operandi, but his critical philoso-
phy remains, at best, nebulous. '
Predictably, many charges have been
leveled against White, from “hypocrite”
to “contrarian” to today’s new ‘Internet-
ism, “troll.” More effective,‘ however, than
any name-calling was a single July article
from Slant Magazine, entitled “Hating
the Player, Losing the Game,” which re-
spectfully but devastatingly deconstructs
White’s scathing review of “Toy Story 3,”
exposing both factual and critical/logical
errors. -

Peter Travers/ Rolling Stone! B

There are two reasons why Travers’ _b1urbs
appear in seemingly more trailers than
any other critic’s. One — he’s a snappy
writer and inﬁnitely quotable. Two — he’s
a generous critic, much like his Rolling
Stone colleague David Fricke in the music
department. If there’s one populist movie
reviewer, it’s Travers.

Fittingly, he’s in the same camp as Ebyertz
impassioned, hilarious, but often quick tb
surrender to sentiment. More than any
other prominent reviewer, Travers is a
sucker for cheeky violence — see “Kick-
Ass” — and popcorn—movie fun. It should
be noted, however, that this doesn’t stop
him from bringing the hammer down on
his mortal enemy, Michael Bay — see his
zero-star review of “Transformers: Re-
venge of the Fallen,” in many ways the
antithesis of Armond White’s review.

A. 0. Scott/The New York Times: A

The most levelheaded of The New York

. Times’ critics — on the other side of the

spectrum is the blistering Manohla Dar-
gis -— Scott isn’t known for snappy one-
liners or novel methods ofjudgment a

- la Roger Ebert’s thumb system, but he -

digs deep in the space allotted him, even
when his source material is seemingly
void of opportunities for insight —- see
“Piranha 3-D.” - '

Granted, Scott can sometimes be un-
necessarily scathing — he seems to have
little to no tolerance of “fun” movies —
but in a world of humoring Eberts and
Traverses, he provides somemuch-needed
groundedness.

Panthers drop first two in Big East

H” V n Elstrhrr

Ashley Cuba tries to control the ball in the team’s game against Marquette. The Panthers lost to the Golden Eagles, 2-1.

The women’s soccer team lost its ﬁrst.

two “Big East games this weekend when it
opened both with a strong defense during
the ﬁrst half but lost momentum in the
second half.

The Panthers started the conference
season on the road,’falling to South Florida
2-0 on Friday. On Sunday, Pitt returned
home, where Marquette pulled out a _2—1
victory. _ -

South Florida 2, Pitt 0 .

Pitt kept the game scoreless against South

Florida in the ﬁrst half, but couldn’t hold "

off the Bulls in the second half.

“South Florida was kind of upsetting,”
Pitt junior Katelyn Ruhe said. “We’re just
missing a last piece. We believe that we can
do it, but we just. need to push harder for

.90 minutes.” '
The ﬁrst goal came in the 50“‘ minute,

when Chelsea Klotz took a shot from the .

middle of the box and slipped the ball by

Pitt goalkeeper Morie Kephart in the lower

right hand corner of the goal. ‘
But the Panthers had several chances

. to tie‘ the game in the second,half._’ In_the

615‘ minute, Ashley Cuba’s .shot hit off the
crossbar. Then, in the 74“‘ minute, Cuba
ﬁred again, but South Florida goalkeeper
Nicole McClure’s diving save prevented

Q the score.

Katelyn Lippert took a shot at tying the

‘ score in the 83"’ minute, but McClure made

another diving stop and deﬂected the ball
wide.

The Bulls pushed the game out of Pitt’s
reach in the 88“‘.minute, when Taylor Pat-
terson drilled a pass from Venicia Reid
into the net. i

“It was a good game,” Ruhe said. “_It

shouldn’t have been 2-0 any means. They.

didn’t outplay us at all, we played well.”
South Florida out—shot the Panthers

15-10, including 8-5 in shots, on goal. At

halftime, the shot totals were more even,

with the Bulls managing six shots to Pitt’s

ﬁve.

“I thought we did well against South
Florida creating some corner kicks,” Pitt
‘head coach Sue—Moy Chin said. “We put
them under pressure, but that was after
we were already down a goal.”

Kephart had a season—high six saves,
rirzcluding$f99I>,i1!g;a.sh9tfr9r!119Yards out

\

in the ﬁrst half to prevent the Bulls from
gaining an early advantage. V ‘
Cuba ﬁnished with a team—high four
shots, including two on goal.
. Chin said the Panthers need to work on
ﬁnishing chances and starting stronger,
the latter of which she saidthey. achieved

‘against Marquette.

Marquette 2,Pitt 1

Pitt kept Marquette’s offense in check in
the ﬁrst half, but second half goals were
again the Pathers’ undoing. The Golden
Eagles scored twice in the second half to
defeat the Panthers 2-1.

"‘We started out strong against Mar—'

quette with our intensity and the play was
very good,” Chin said. “We almost scored
on a corner kick early.” -

Early in the ‘second half, Rachel Brown
scored her second goal of the season after

she collected a"lo'ose ball off a corner kick i

and put Marquetteiup 1-0. A

AN’ 0LTMANN’S OPINION

Pitt football

if

Willbounce
back

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

_,,

I think it’s safe to say that this is not the way Pitt
football fans envisioned their team starting off
the season.

A 1-2 record, fresh off a 28-point beating at
the hands of Miami, All—American defensive
end Greg Romeus out forthe foreseeable future
with an injury and preseason Heisman Trophy
candidate Dion Lewis struggling to ﬁnd any
kind of running room. And they’re not the only
problems.

But what fans seem to have forgotten amidst
Pitt’s struggles through its three nonconference
games is this: the Big East schedule hasn’t even!
begun yet. i ' ‘ .

In a league that is as up for grabs as the Big

, East is this year, the Panthers still have a great

chance to win the league and automatically
qualify for a coveted BCS bowl game if theycan
improve and make some changes before the Oct.
16 league opener at Syracuse.

And changes are already in the works. It’s

- looking like senior safety Dom DeCicco will

be moved to strong-side linebacker to shake
things up there. The coaches seem conﬁdent

, with redshirt freshmanjason Hendricks starting; .

at safety after he started in that position during
DeCicco’s injury.

In an attempt to ﬁx the problems along the
interior of the offensive line, which has been
a major site of the team’s glaring weaknesses
so far, starting right tackle Lucas Nix might be

' moving inside to take over at right guard for ‘

Greg Gaskins, while Jordan Gibbs would step
in at right tackle. '
Yes, quarterback Tino Sunseri has struggled
this season, but he’ll only improve as he gets
more game experience. He’s a smart player with
a strong arm, and as the season goes along, Pittg

, fans will _see marked improvement fromhim.

‘Pitt struggled against Utah and Miami, two
teams ranked in the Top 20 in this week’s poll.
But from here on, the Panthers won’t face any
teams that are currently ranked. .

There isn’ta Big East game on their schedule

that isn’t winnable. , if

The Pitt football team looked overwhelmed

some serious shake—ups if they’re going to
contend for the Big East Championship,
or get above .500 by the time conference
season rolls around.

“We are not in sync in some areas of our
football team,” Pitt coach Dave Wannst—
edt said. “When you have ﬁve sacks, nine
tackles for loss and three turnovers, you
are not going to beat anybody.”

Many people are wondering what’s

rushed for 100 yards on 14 carries, but it
wasn’t easy, and Graham can’t carry the
offense alone. Lewis and Graham need

the sidelines, and some lethargic plays
from the receivers. If the coaches want
the balanced offense they’re always talk-
ing about, they’re going to have to take a
few more chances and become a little less
predictable.

‘For almost all of the game, the play-

Panthers
should
win league

Oltmanns 4 11

Syracuse has been terrible forthe last decade
and that hasn’t changed this year. Pitt should
hand them a beat—down in their league opener.

Then Rutgers comes to town. The-Scarlet
Knights already lost to a North Carolina team
that’s missing about half its starters due to sus-
pension, so that tells you all you need to know
about Rutgers. Another win for Pitt.

After that, the Panthers play Louisville, a
team which has actually kept close with some
quality teams early this season after havingpro—
duced some bad teams the past few years.

But Pitt beat the Cardinals 35-10 last season
and Panther fans can expect more of the same
this year.

Then the Panthers travel to Connecticut to
take on the Huskies who, after getting some pre-
season hype, have fallen Hat on their faces after
getting embarrassed by Michigan and Temple.

Losing to Temple? Enough said. Pitt’s abetter
team than the Huskies and should beat them in
the Thursday night primetime game.

In case you’re counting, that would push the
Panthers conference record to 4-0.

Their ﬁfth league game will be against South ‘

Florida, which has been average at best the last
few years. They have a lot of athletes, but not
enough to beat Pitt. 5-0.

Thatwill set the stage for the Backyard Brawl
against West Virginia, the toughest game re-
maining on Pitt_’s schedule. B

At this point, WVU looks betterthan Pitt, but
in a rivalry game like that, you can throw all the
stats out the window.Just ask the Mountaineers
about their infamous 13-9 loss to Pitt in the 2007
edition of the Brawl when they were» clearly a
better team that year.

So that game could go either way, setting the
Panthers up at either 6-0 or 5-1 in Big East play
heading into the season ﬁnale_at Cincinnati.

The Bearcats are not the same elite squad
they were last year. They still have offensive
weapons, but the loss of former coach Brian
Kelly seems to have really made an impact, as
Cincinnati already has three losses.

Add to that how Pitt wants revenge after the
Bearcats edged them out to win the Big East
crown last year, and the Panthers should leave
Ohio with either their sixth or seventh league
win. ‘

Pitt might lose a game ortwo that it shouldn’t,
but that happens to almost every team. So ﬁve
wins is apossibility, but I would put my money on
six wins and a Big East crown for the Panthers.

So cheer up, Panther fans. Wins are on the

way. I

Panthers lose on late penalty kick

Team looks to get their first Big East win on Friday against Louisville.

Women’s Soccer 4 11

Pitt’s ‘Alexandra Jaffe answered in the
68”‘ minute when she headed a corner kick
from Ruhe into the net. It was Jaffe’s ﬁrst
goal of the season and Ruhe picked up an
assist on the play. v

Lauren Thut’s ﬁrst goal of the season was
also the game winner. She sealed the game
for the Golden Eagles in the 83”‘ minute off
a penalty kick.

The team will be focusing on keeping

' their composure before the next game,

Chin said.

V “We got a little but better on ball, but
we were panicky at times and then we turn
the ball over,” she said. “It was a tough one
to lose.”

Marquette out-shot Pitt by a slight 5-3
margin in the ﬁrst half, but held a 12-2 ad-
vantage in the second half.

Ruhe said she’s conﬁdent the Panthers

have the skill to continue improving as the
season goes on, hopefully ﬁnding their way
to more scoring opportunities.

“We’re very talented this year, we just
can’t seem to ﬁnd the goal as much as we‘
should be,” Ruhe said. “If we ﬁnd that, we’ll
be good.”

Pitt receives its next opportunity to put
up a Big East win on Oct. 1, when the Pan-
thers take on Louisville in Kentucky. 3

calling remained the same: run, run (and
probably lose a few yards), run again and
then attempt to throw a pass approximate-
ly ﬁve yards and end up short of the ﬁrst
down. A shot down the ﬁeld to Baldwin
would have been nice to see, especially
considering he’s one of the most gifted
athletes in the Big‘East.

“We have a good play on offense and
then two bad plays,” Wannstedt said.
“That’s where we are‘. We are inconsis-
tent on offense and that’s theway we’ve
been all year.”

Against the Hurricanes, the Pitt offense
was lucky if it managed the one good play
before the two bad plays.

After the ﬁrst series of the game, the
defense played well and kept the Panthers
in the game for longer than they prob-
ably should have been._]abaa1 Sheard and
Jarred Holley were bright spots for Pitt on
a dreary night at Heinz Field. '

Sheard consistently put pressure on
Miami quarterbackjacory Harris, record-
ing two sacks. Holley ﬁnished with an in-
terception and broke up two passes. But
their strong performances need to carry
over to the rest of the Panthers, especially
the pass defense. ‘ ,

This group hasn’t impressed in any
game this season, but left players com-
pletely exposed against Miami. The faster
and seemingly more athletic Hurricanes
didn’t have any trouble moving the ball
down the ﬁeld, while the Panthers strug-
gled to keep up and make an impact.

Aside from the defensive line that
showed heart, the Panthers appeared list-
less overall. One has to wonder whether
off-the-ﬁeld issues are ﬁnding their way
onto the ﬁeld. With Greg Romeus out after
back surgery, ﬁve football players disci-
plined for offathe-ﬁeld actions since July
and now Dan .Mason’s dislocated knee,
Pitt could be struggling for leadership and-
direction.

When Bill Stull, Gus Mustakas and Mick
Williams stood on the ﬁeld for the Meineke
Car Care Bowl recognition on Thursday
night, attention was drawn to more than
just the bowl win last season. The question
on many fans’ minds had to be, “Where’s
that leadership this season?”

‘fWe have tremendous players but we
have to play as a team,” Sheard said. “I
don’t know.what the problem is, but we

h h have to ﬁnd out and wevhave to ﬁx it. t
“For iﬁysetf," I‘ just ‘need ‘to practicew v ,> .

harder. I’m not the most vocal player, but
if I have to step up, I will.” I
