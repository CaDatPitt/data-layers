.  to Orange Bowl

r Dims for Panthers

, _ By BOB SMIZIK - _
j A Gator Bowl bidappears the best the Panther-. football team
‘will come -up with this year. Chances of the team receiving a

bid "to the Orange Bowl were reduced drastically following
last weekend’s events. '

‘Athletic director Frank Carver cited three reasons which
he feels have all but eliminated the Panthers from the ‘Orange
Bowl running.

Carver labeled Nebraska’s win. over Oklahoma last Saturday,
the fact that the Panthers play in Miami, the home of the Orange
Bowl, Saturday and the team’s late ending schedule as factors
which will probably ‘cost the Panthers the ‘Orange Bowl bid.

The biggest factor could be Nebraska’s win over Oklahoma.
The victory gav_e Nebraska the Big Eight title which automatical-
ly gives the man Orange Bowl bid. '

Carver said, “Nebraska is not the draw in Miami that Okla.-
homa would be. Because of this the selection committee will
probably invite a Southern team as Nebraska’s opponent in hopes
of drawing a bigger crowd. G '

“A Birmingham paper reported that Auburn will ‘get the
Orange Bowl bid,” Carver continued, “and they were probably
right. Had Oklahoma won _the Big Eight" title our chances~of
getting the Orange ‘Bowl bid would be much better.” 2

Pitt’s appearance Saturday night in the Orange Bowl‘ to play"
Miami also will hurt the Panthers’ chances, according to Carver._

Carver said, “The fact that we play in Miami Saturday is not
going to help us. It’s happened before and I don’t think they like
to invite a team to play in the Orange Bowl if they have recently
played in Miami.” '

The Panthers’ Dec. 7 date with Penn Stateat the Stadium is
not going to help the team either. “Our toughest game has been
put back to the end of the season,” Carver said. “They’d like to
see how well we do against Sate, but they don’t want to wait
that long. If we had played and beaten Penn State last weekend
our chances would have been better.” -

Carver said, “The Gatdr Bowl has not made its decision yet.”
But as the country’s number four team, it appears the Panthers
could have the bid for the asking.

Med School Dean Seeks Law Clarification

Dr. Francis S. Cheever, Dean of the

  

University’s medical school, sought a clar-
iﬁcation of the law concerning the medical
students, obligations -in Philadelphia ‘last
week. ,

Under the state’s new Medical Prac-
tices Act signed into" law Aug.‘ 14, third
and fourth year medical students are per-
mitted “to make unoiﬁcial notes upon
patient histories and physical examina-
tions and to perform certain laboratory
tests for instruction and experience.”

It is widely known, however, that
many students are being allowed —even
encouraged — to go farther than this.
Medical students are serving as inter-
mediaries between nurses and doctors.

one hospital only every four or ﬁve nights,
some hold jobs at four or ﬁve hospitals
and work every night. It is not uncommon
for a student to derive his sole means of
support from this source.

Dean Cheever said the University has
adopted a hands-off policy on the matter,

and added:
“We may re-examine our policy in

, the light of what we hear from the Med-

ical Examining Board.”

Dr. Cheever said it would be “inter-
esting to see how deep and extensive the
situation is. I do not consider it our busi-

. Cartoonist Talks on ‘Life, Times, and FunnyPapers’  

Satirist Jules Feiffer Speaks
At Midday ‘Series Wednesday

Cartoonist-satirist Jules Feilfer will speak at the Midday
Series Wednesday. ~
His topic will be “Life, Times and the Funny Papers."
Feiffer delights in controversies stirred up by his cartoons. .
His favorite topics include “the baﬂlement of love in the city,"

“hypocrisy in political morality,” and, simply enough, “nuclear

destruction.” 

A Brooklyn resident, Feiffer has recently had published his
novel,‘ Harry, the Rat with Women. The book is one of the
most talked-about of the year, being as widely attacked as_ it
has been highly praised. .

Feiffer started in art at the age of ﬁve when he won
an art contest. He proceeded to find that art. was not so 
easy and discovered that an appropriate caption under a
bad drawing can enhance that drawing immeasurably. From
that moment, he claims, the decision to become a cartoonist
was easy. 3 ' .

“The Village Voice,” a Greenwich Village weekly, was the
ﬁrst publication to feature the work of Feiffer. That paper's
readers are an intellectual group and the impetus gained from
establishing himself with that, group pushed him into the lime-
light of. cartoonists. He, now regular contributes to" Playboy,
Holiday, and Sports'Illustrat_ed magazines as well as‘the London

' Observer, the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune 7

and newspapers in’ Rome and Stockholm. .
His collected cartoons include “Sick, Sick, Sickf’

and-“Feiﬁer’s Album.” '
One of the prides of Feiffer is that he has made the top
grade of his profession without sellinganything but his mes-

sage — strictly on his own terms. He is one of the few whose‘

contract includes the provision that not a single word of ‘his
-submitted material may bechanged. _ _ .
. Feiffer is “alone and unafraid in a ,world made of . . . just
about all of the intellectual shams and shibboleths to which our.
culture subscribes,” according-to critic Gilbert Millstein. '
The early work of Feiffer was acclaimed by editors but none
wouldupublish it,.'saying that it was unmarketable. The car-
toonist, ﬁguringthat if his work could be so highly regarded and
still be unmarketable he should make himself known, offered

that work free — his best offer at that date -— and the Village. '

Voice" published it to high reader acclaim.
’ His work consists of plainly drawn panels accompanied «
by ‘captions in .the form of a soliloquy or dialogue. The Pitt '
News ran his cartoons in its..publica_tions_?last year.

A coffee hour will beheld in the SU Lower Lounge at

A SMILING and energetic John F. Kennedy attracted many Pitts-

S

burgh residents, including a large number of students, when he
spoke at the Feld House last October. His personality made his
death even more of a personal loss to many.

The news of President Ken-
nedy’s assassination brought
University events to a grind-
ing halt. On Friday after-
noon rnany professors called
off their classes. That night
Dick Gregory’s performance at
Soldiers and Sailors
was cancelled.

Chancellor Litchﬁeld announced
that .Saturday’s game with Penn
State was to be postponed until

of activity with the party sched-

little action; the party had been

torn down. _
With the news that Monday's
classes had been cancelled in

Scranton’s suggestion of state-
wide schoolclosings, the mass
exodus began. _A great number
of students who had not plan-

How can one begin to describe and evaluate the events of the past ﬁve days? In
the issue of The Pitt News which appeared yesterday, we attempted to present an ac-
curate portrayal of the University? as the tragic news of the assassination of President
Kennedy reached Pittsburgh. Since then, however, the shock has well worn off, and
the initial impressions of disbelief and sorrow have been replaced with a more ma-
ture feeling of personal loss. a -

John Fitzgerald Kennedy was perhaps agreatpresident, but this is a statement
‘which can only be justiﬁed by time. Perhaps even an ‘entire generation will pass

 away before the true impact of this man’s personality and accomplishments will be

I’ completely and accurately analyzed.

To speculate upon the outcome of this analysis is not within our power; how-"

ever, it is clearthat we all lost something of great value when John Kennedy was
buried in Arlington Cemetery two days ago. ' ' , . A

His burial was the symbolic burial of, the great symbol of youth that was JFK.
It was his yitality, imagination, and determination that endeared him to the hearts

"of his fellow Americans. And it was his youth that endeared him especially to the ,

generation of which we are a part. , _ _
He was not one of those grand oldfelder statesmen whose. age and demeanor
so far remove them‘from us that there can never be any personal identiﬁcation. JFK

was much closer. He went about things ‘in a manner and with an enthusiasm which V

younger people all over the country could appreciate. ' r .

. Even in his family life, there was a se nseof identiﬁcation. Jacki Kennedywas the
-perfect college girl turned wife and mother, and his two children were young enough
-to be our own. ' K v

John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the perfect man. He. was a war hero but not of the
god‘-like variety such as Eisenhower. He was a Pulitzer Prize winning author, and a
man whose close friends ranged from emperors to movie actors. He Was a college
graduate and a statesman without par in an era of great statesmen. He was the head
of a powerful family that could‘ almost be called a dynasty. He was an athlete, father,

lThe

and orator. He was,'in fact, the American ideal moulded into human form. V
Unlike Lincoln, he did not belong to the ages. He belonged to and was the per-
soniﬁcation of the spirit of America. And now he is dead and that spirit has died with

  

Somebody mentioned Friday
night that that afternoon’s
tragedy was the first of such
universal importance to affect
‘our generation. Our parents

II, and had grieved at the death.

of Roosevelt, and when they
said,'we’ve seen more than y-Ail,
so take our word for it, we
sometimes mused what it would
be like to live through a na-
tional disaster.

For many, especially after
Monday classes were cancelled,
it meant getting home as fast
as they could. Automatically,
family unity seemed quite im-
portant. For most, it shook

, them from their seemingly

endless security as the unvan-
_quished youth — kids who had
gone through personal troubles

as something objective a n d
apart,’ something t h a t really
didn’t concern them as individ-
uals. '

' Indeed we were immature
because we had n e v e r been
challenged. Our parents, gener-
ation frequently regarded us as
spoiled because we had never

_undergone such experience —

we had never tramped on tin >

us lamb chops on bi-weekly
uisits; we had never seen our
whole high school class rnarch
off to war and hear that the.
guy we had sat next to in Eng-
lish class was now dead. ,

Last year’s Cuban’ crisis
brought a scare, but a month
later the impact on our per-
sonal lives was non—existent.
Friday brought ‘a reality.

One friend of mine told me
a story that is so fraught with
irony it seems unreal,‘yet« in a
sense it symbolizes this shake-
up and the tragic maturing of
our generation as a whole.

Four years ago in a history
class, he relates, he remem-
bered watching his little old
teacher describe the death of
Lincoln, tears ‘falling over ‘her
cheeks as she -acted‘ out Booth’s
stance in the box in Ford Thea-
tre, the shot, and the collapse
of the President.

She. kept emphasizing re-
sponsibility, he said, the re-
sponsibility of Booth, of Lin-
coln, and of her students as
citizens, of the United States.

This overs.entimental-
ity nauseated- him. ‘fln boyish

my imagination a chance to get

So four ye a rs later, after

"hearing the ﬁrst news over an” .

bumped into that former A teach-'

er. crossing Fifth Avenue.
There »-w e r e smiles, hand-

shakes, an d a‘ ‘‘What’s- your-

-He‘ sat in our ofﬁce a few

‘days ‘ago’ mulling this irony.

Suddenly _the romantic idea of
tragedy had disappeared: no

, longer did it seem dramatic and
exciting that our fathers fought ‘
.- in a war; no longer did the

grief attached/to a national dis-
aster affect only‘ other people.

Tragedy doesn’t work that
way. It’s harsh. When it’s of

a personal nature, the individ-

ual grows. When it’s of a na-
tional. nature, a generation be-
gins to mature.

Perhaps President John Ken-
nedy’s death stung even more
frantically’ because, in a sense,
he represented the vigor and
optismism of his people, par-
ticularly this generation of
youth. His death meant a dis-

heartening of our own in-

nocence; self - identiﬁcation
plunged the level of homage
into a sincere individual loss.
It’s not the kind of experi-
ence you welcome with open
arms; there is no romantic aura
of an incipient maturity for a
generation. I think, in fact, it
wishes it were still spoiled -

the, third stage of the disease. They can

be found trying on last summer’s bathing

I think it ﬁtting and appropriate
to the Thanksgiving holiday to re-
port on a motion picture which,
in the jargon of the show world,
can be referred to as a “turkey.”
A turkey _is any- type of show
business venture that is not suc-
cessful from either the creative or

' ‘the box office levels that have

been set forth by the muhatmas
of the mass media." Such a turkey
seen currently at the
Warner Theatre. under the label
of “family—situation—type comedy.”
It is “Take Her, She’s Mine,” a
movie adaptation of a Broadway
comedy hit of the 1962-63 season,
but everything that was charming
and delightful on the stage has
been lost _completely in this miser-
able screen version.

The latest chapter to the “father
is an idiot” epic poem shows
James Stewart as the dad of a
beautiful student played by San-
dra Dee, who has grown into an
independent young woman and
appears to be cutting away all
family ties. .Mr. Stewart and
spouse Audrey Meadows . send
their child. off to college although
they can’t believe that she has
grown up and is no longer .a

“V4 skinny adolescent in bluejeans.

Miss Dee gets into all sorts of
escapades at college, and then as
an art student in Paris, while
Dear Old Dad shows up each time
to bail‘ his little daughter out of
trouble and gain some embarras-
sing front page news on each oc-
casion.

“Embarrassing” seems to be the

keynote of this technicolor rehash '

of about three hundred similar

O’, story lines. Stewart gives his usual

folksy performance as the bum-
bling boob»of a father whose con-
stant action ends on an embarras-
sing note. Audrey Meadows looks
A so bored and blase

B°"ed, about the proceed-
and ings that the only
“use compensation for

her seemingly em-
barrassed state would be her pay-

-*‘check. The dialogue, supplied by

Nunnally Johnson, a normally in--

ventive and amusing scenarist, is_

neither inventive, amusing, nor,
for that matter, normal. Here we
are faced with the same fantastic
lines and actions that have made
television "viewing such a joy.
Take any episode from such
shows as “Bachelor Father,”
‘Ozzie and Harriet,” “My Three
Sons,” “The Donna Reed Show,”
et. al. Put them all into a blender
of -some sort. Add color, scenery,

fore you can say “Hedda Hopper,”
out comes the ﬁnished product,

which on this occasion happens to

be “Take Her, She’s Mine.”

Also in the cast of the comedy
being dissected are Robert Morley
and -Phillipe Forquet. The former
is one of the funniest actors in
motion pictures today, and has
been for more than 25 years; He

‘gives an amusing‘ performance in

this movie as he is able to’over-
come the banal script and make

‘his style felt strongly. The latter

luxury to the concotion, and be- .

supporting performer is a young.

and handsome French actor who
can’t act. Since he is young and
handsome and has that irresistible
Gallic charm, I think he may suc-
ceed in Hollywood. If he should
ever learn how to act, his career
may be’ in jeopardy. However, at
this point, M. Forquet stands as
the French equivalent of Troy
Donahue and similar “talents.”

Now for Miss Sandra Dee. She
looks very healthy in a bikini and
there is no doubt but that she has
grown immeasurably since her
movie career. began about six
years ago. Her little girl voice at
the age of 16 was cute and viv-
acious. She played the type of
parts that didn’t require any great
level of emoting -ability and
achieved instant popularitY- M155
Dee still has that same style "of
talking and acting and hasn’t im_-
proved one iota. She is still that
sweeter-than—sugar young lover

By ART FLEISCHNER
Fairfield University,‘ mainly- known as
the training place of the New York
Giants, will open the Panthers’ basket-
ball season Saturday night at the Field
House. The game begins at 7:15 and
will precede the Duquesne-American

/contest. —»
Despite the fact that they are a small

school, Fairﬁeld plays a diﬂicult sched- \

ule in basketball. After the game with
Pitt, they play Boston College and
Providence. They also have scheduled
Holy Cross, Seton Hall, St. Joseph and
Fordham.

The fact that Fairﬁeld is a’ small
school keeps them from being put in
the national ratings, but like West-
minster, they usually come up with a
strong team.

This season might be the exception.

 

best possible starting lineup, is experi-
menting with various combinations. All
of these combinations have one thing in
common —- at least three sophs.
Leading the list of talented sopho-
mores are the three who paced last
season’s freshman team to a 17-4 mark.
This trio of Pat Burke, Mike Branch
and Stan Poole averaged 55 points a
game as frosh. . ' I
Burke, a 6—foot-4 center, averaged
21 points a game last season. Branch
possesses a deadly outside jump shot
and rebounds well.
_ The other sophomore, Poole plays
both forward and guard. If he plays

start at forward. *

In contrast to Fairﬁeld’s dependenea

hopes on six experienced seniors. All

years and all have started at one time

or another.

Coach Bob Timmons has still not de-J
cided on who will start at guard with‘
Dave Roman. Both Cal Sheﬁield and
Tim Grgurich are ﬁghting for that posi-
tion. Sheffield started the scrimmage
against St. Francis, but Grgurich‘ saw as

much action as Roman and Sheffield.
With Sheffield in the lineup, the

Panthers have ﬁve men who are cap- -1 ,.

able of averaging in double ﬁgures.
However, Grgurich makes the teagm
stronger defensively. * Timmons said,

"AS ,Gridder,s Se-ek Eighth Victory

Victory number eight will be the goal of the Panther
gridders Saturday night as they take on the Miami Hur-
ricanes at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.

V The Panthers may be affected by the layoff that was

I incurred due to the assassination of President Kennedy
and the postponement of the Penn State game to Decem-
ber 7. Most of the Panther ballplayers -wanted to play Penn State
as scheduled. Halfback Dale Stewart said, “We were really up‘
for this one. I don't know if we can get up again.”

Aside from the shock and disappointment suffered last week-
'end the team is‘in good shape. They worked out Tuesday‘ at Trees
Field in preparation for the Saturday night encounter with the
Hurricanes. A

Miami has been one. of the major disappointments of the

college football season this year. From last year’s 7-4, record the

. Hurricanes have faded to a poor 3-5. They have defeated Tulane,

Purdue, and Kentucky, none of which can be classiﬁed as powers.

They were beaten by Florida State, L.S.U., North Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida.

"The Hurricanes are coached by Andy Gustafson, a Pitt grad-
uate who is in his sixteenth and ﬁnal year as head coach. He '
will assume the post of athletic director after the current season. i,
In his ﬁfteen previous seasons Miami has had‘ only four losing
records. They have participated in four bowl games.

The biggest name on the Miami team is George Mira, their
all-America quarterback.l“Mira is a greater passer and football

player than he was last year, despite our record,”‘said Gustaf-
son. In his first six games, Mira completed 96 passes for 1054
yards. He is the nation’s number two passer.

Mira’s record wouldbe even better than it is if his receivers
would learn to hold on to the ball. In the Hurricanes’ ﬁrst six
games 26 perfect tosses were dropped by his receivers._In the
Kentucky game, halfback Nick Spinelli dropped one two yards

. from the end zone with nobody near him.‘This bad luck has

plagued the Hurricanes all year.

Hawks Hold Lead
With One Triumph
In Writers’ (Loop

The Pitt News Hawks, uride—

' feated in their only outing this

year, are in the unique position

of possibly winning the Eastern

Journalism Conference title af-
.ter only playing one game.

The Hawks’ game Saturday

with Penn State Daily Collegian
Cowards was postponed arid ‘if
-the game cannot be replayed,
the Hawks will take the Con-
ference title on the basis‘ of
having the best percentage.

Jim “Juggernaut” O’Brien
said he did'not-want to win the
title under such circumstances.
“It would be a hollow victory,”
O’Brien said. “I could not take
pride in the accomplishment if‘
such were the case. After all,”
O’Brien continued, “it matters
not'if you’ve won or lost, but
‘how you played the game.”

Because of President John F.

week’s yogi contest were played.

Josey Grossman, who picked for
the girls last week, had the ﬁrst
perfect record of the season, 4-0.

Marvin “Isaiah” Zelkowi_tz_.re-
mained one game behind the
players, as they each had 3-1
marks. Bob “Sage” Smizik was
also 3-1,.

_ ,The coaches, Jim ' “Jugger-

head Swetonic had 2-2 records
last week. I

With twoiweeks still remaining
in the yogi contest, the players
have a close to .750 mark, 91-37.
Bob Roeder picks for the athletes

this week in an attempt topull
them further ahead of Zelkowitz.

Nancy Delaney picks for the
girls, who now only trail the
players by four games.

Frank_ Carver picks for the

players by 11 games.

This week’s‘ contest consists of
