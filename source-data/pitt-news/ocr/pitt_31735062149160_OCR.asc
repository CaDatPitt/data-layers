Fifth of the 17 nationalities rooms
designed for the Cathedral, the Cze-
choslovak Room is the ﬁrst of the
second series of four rooms to be

sentative of Czecho-Slovakia to the
United States after the post-war
founding of the republic. He was
later made minister to Great Britain
and held this post until the Munich
agreement. His radio speech on the
crisis was regarded as the high point
of the _ pre—pact arguments.

At present he is on a lecture tour

or at the anniversary dinner which
will be held in the Hotel Schenley at
6 o’clock Tuesday. The dinner is

committee. Plans for the room were
drawn by Bohumil Slama, one of the
leading architects of Prague.

‘Beware of Colds,’

Warns Dr. Carlson

Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, director of
the Student Health Service, warns
all students to beware of colds. Ac-
cording to the good doctor, you don't

house plant to
avoid colds, in-
stead, just keep
up your resist-
ance.

To do this, drink
plenty of water,

a v 0 id quick
change in temper-
ature, keep .regu-
lar, and get plenty
of rest, he advises.

“C olds,” the
doctor-coach says,
“are most preval-
ent this time of
year. partly because of the lack in
the diet of sufﬁcient fresh fruits and
vegetables.”

320,000 to the University was in.-
troduced Wednesday in the state

Students to Try Out
For Individual Spots
Before Fallon, Miller

Specialty acts of all kinds are
“desperately needed for “At Your
|Service,” the new Cap and Gown
ishow, Henry DeRocher, M40, pro-
iduction manager, says.

 “Any kind of an idea will be ex-
’amined, appraised, improved, and
;given a chance to be in the show,”
iDeRocher said.
; Tryouts for specialty ideas are be-
g ing held almost every day. Appoint-
jments for tryouts are made each day
Fafter 1:30 o’clock by the production
Estas in 323 Cathedral.
.' Acts are judged and suggestions
;for improvement are given by Mar-

iproduction, and by Ruth Miller,
jdance director. ,
& Specialties may be of any kind, ac-
cording to Fallon, as long as there
,is the remotest chance of their ﬁt-
Eting into the plot. “Don’t worry
about the ease of working the spec-
-ialty in,” he said, “for if the act is
;good enough, we’ll work the plot in.”

éllhunls’ Sweetles

Those uniforms seen in the Com-
mons Room are not to be associated
with another hell week. This time
the Pitt Riﬂe boys have a much
more pleasant duty, that of shadow-
ing several of the young ladies who
are the girl friends of three cast
members of “Brother Ra.t,” which
will be presented by Pitt Players
at the Foster Memorial March 9
and 10.

The reason for the military es-
cort is to prevent these coeds from
conversing with males other than
their steadies, an old VMI custom.

ton Moskovitz, C42, follow Ger-
trude Foreman. C41; Phyllis Post,

Another Dodo
0n the Way (Put?

NEE upon a time, as the old line goes, a dance
chairman was an individual held in high honor
and esteem. his position coveted and envied by
the student masses, his en1inent personage pointed
out to incoming freshmen as the pinnacle of Uni-
versity achievement.

‘We, who may have. in our time, been unkind to
this supreme species of activity man, have always
been aware of this hero-worshipping attitude, this
continual emphasis on the importance of his
position.

Lately, however, we have been worried by dis-
comﬁting evidence that the dance chairman, as a
campus institution. is slipping from his lofty place
i11 student activities. This evidence, strangely
enough, comes not from any indirect source, such
as a supervising dean"s oflice, independent party
leader, disg"r1n1t'le<.l “comp-seeke1',” etc.

Our source is a statement. printed in this very
newspaper the other day, credited to the chairman
of the current I-F ball, and reading as follows: “It”
seems foolish to have dance chairnien, if they are
only to be piippcts in the hands of administrative
ofﬁcers.”

Can it be that. the dance cliairinan has stumbled
from his former heights, is now really a mere “pup-
pet,” responding to jerks of the string’? Can it be
that the species is tlireatened with extiiiction, and
faces the same unkind fate as the legendzmv dodo
bird?

1*‘ranl~:l_v, we don ‘t know, and we don’t particu-
larly care. \Vc have always n1aintain_ed that there
are more important things in a Unive1'sit_\' than
dance c;-.l1airmanships.

But we 're just curious, and, at the same time,
sozncwliat reluctant to witness the possible smash-
ing of all of our carefully built-up illusions.

Sclnoiaws may
Brings to Nﬁinci . . ..

OR SOME weeks now, the columns of The News

have been deluged with advance poblicity on
_Schoiars‘ Day. More will come later, no doubt.

L-lot. don't get us wrong. We think Scholars’
Day Iloscrvcs ever_v bit. of news space it has been
given. serving as it does as the one day in the school
year when scholastic merit is acknowledged and
p1‘()pz‘1'l_\' honored.

In reading over this Scholars' Day business,
however. we suddenl_v became aware of the absence
of an old practice. Not so long ago. it used to be
the custom to print in The News, twice a year, a11
“Honor Roll,” listing the names of all students
who had acliicvcd a 2.2 average or better the pre-
vious semester.

It is now almost two _\‘ea1‘s since the last honor
roll was printed in The News. The regular biennial
request‘ lnatlc by this paper of the Registrar's of-
vce for such a list has been custon1aril_v met with
the reply that none has been made up.

Now. of course, we realize that the laborious
preparation of an honors list merely adds another
burden to an already hard pressed staff in the Reg-
istrar’s office. And we are aware that, in the long
run, mere grades are inconsequential in the scheme
of education.

Yet. we hate to see the old honor roll tradition
die out because of the specter of a twice—_vearly
clerical stint. All too little honor is paid to those
old-fashioned souls who still insist that the main
purpose of a University is to disseminate education.

Maybe we’re just being sentimental. Anyway,
we’d still like to see the old honor roll revived so
that a few hard-working students can read their
names in six-point. bold face type once a semester.

Well stooodents the Inter-fraternity has certainly
turned into an “I-F” brawl so we wait anxiously to see
if Shaw and his cats will make up for some of the hec-
tics and question marks of the past days . . it’s a
cinch if Shaw doesn't, the Greeks will . .' and will
probably have several new words foruit besides. A’

One dance-couplet who won’t be 0 among the
rasslers are Bill Smale and Jane Coll for they have
ffffffttt at the current writing. Al Abronovic, the
much ﬂuted harmonica swingster, is so anxious to get
into Cap and Gown that in case of failure he threat-

dow. A good bet for Hi Yo, the “At Your Service”
native chief, is Eddie Ziff who does a Rochester bet-
ter than the original.

A Good Deal

With apologies to Fran Durkin we note that Bernie
Mayer denies that he started the erroneous report of
Fran’s pledging to the DTD’s . . . we sigh with this re-
traction, for leaving just one chick out in the cold is
hardly cricket. Bob Good recently jingled the kappa
house and asked one of the kuties if she wanted to take
him to her dance .

SAE formal . . . desperate good agreed.

Continuing on its quest for the

The victory was a double one for
the Phi Kaps as it advanced them

playoff and topped off the birthday
celebration of one of their star play-
ers, Jim "Rollo” Herron.

In the first half neither team

night to give the Newman Club its

evening, dropped in two baskets in
a row to put his team back in the
lead from where it coasted in to
win.

Joe Kristufek tied Cassiano for the
individual scoring leadership in the
fray.

Approves Slash
In Work-Relief

AUSTIN. Texas, March 3.—Per-
haps pointing to future trends in the
important American problem of
work-relief, college students of to-
day who may be the nation’s leaders
of tomorrow have declared themsel-
ves in accord with Congress’ slash in
WPA appropriations, a nation-wide
survey shows.

During the closing days of Janu-
ary Congress rebelled at President
Roosevelt’s spending policies and or-
dered a $150,000,000 cut in relief ap-
propriations. That left $725,000,000
to ﬁnance the WPA from February 7
to June 30, instead of the $875,000,-
000 proposed by the administration.

In a poll of college youth taken
for The News and eighty-two other
college newspapers, the Student
Opinion Surveys of America asked
students, “Do you agree with Con-
gress in reducing relief appropria-
tions?”

Yes, answered. . . . .63.3 per cent

No, answered . . . . . .36.’! per cent

In keeping with this tendency to
oppose the President’s policies, the
Surveys’ percentages showing stu-
dent approval of Franklin D. Roose-
velt as chief executive dropped more
than two points from the showing
during January. College approval of
the President has varied during the
last three months as follows:

Dec. Jan. Feb.
Approve of

F. D. R. . . . .62.8% 65.5% 63.2%

However, despite the drop in his
popularity during the month, which
was probably due to administration
bickerings with Congress, Roosevelt

still paradoxically has almost exact-
ly as many who approve of him per- l
sonally as he has opponents to his!

and 200 yard shuttle race, placedl
second behind the fast moving Phi;
Gams in the eight lap relay, medley;

and took a third in the broad jump. 

The Fijis won the above three!
ﬁrsts, placed second in the 200 yard
shuttle race, and showed in the high
jump.

Bad Break

Phi Delta Theta captured the
broad jump and placed second in the
shot put and high jump.

Kappa Sigma was the recipient of
a bad break in the medley relay.
Racing in the same heat with the
winning Phi Gam quartet of Bow-
man, Smith, Roberts, and Pressell,
Kappa Sigma’s_Wuertenberger “quit”
at the end of the third lap with one
lap remaining. “Wuert”. led Phi
Gam Pressell by three lengths at the
termination of the third lap and
thought the gun signifying the com-
ing of the ﬁnal lap meant the ﬁnish
of the race. .

g. , » Good Race _ _ _ ,

Although the Delt team of Ken-
nedy, Geiger, Downie, and. Hawkins
eventually won the 200-yard shuttle
relay, Phi Kappa and Phi Gamma
Delta put on the best race of. the
evening in their heat-. Al Gurczen-,
ski, 220-pound footballer, toppled
over at the end of the race but was
unable to nip Joe Roberts at the
tape.

Five men tied for the individual
championship in the high jump at»5
feet 8 inches. Included in the ﬁve
were Grimm, Kappa Sigma; Naric,
Delta Tau Delta; Reis, Phi Delta
Theta; Pressell, Phi Gamma Delta;
and Cassiano, Phi Kappa.

The meet was bas,_e,d,.on, the aver-'

age of four contestants from each

house in the high jump, broad jump, :

.1o_p-step-and-jump, and shot put.

Individual championships in the
shot put, hop-step-and-jump, and
broad jump went to Benghauser of
Delta Tau Delta in the shot with a
heave of 48 feet 5 inches; Quick,
Phi Gamma Delta, placed ﬁrst in the
hop-step-and-jump by a half-shoe
length over Shepley of Phi Kappa
with a leap of 38 feet 5 inches; and
Jim Kennedy over-shadowed “Cur-
ly” Stebbins by 1% inches in the
broad jump with a “float through
the air” of 19 feet 8 inches.

Delta Tau Delta had the broad
jump well under control except for

the fact that Red Crunkelton failed
to leave the ground and fouled in
three consecutive tries. The Delts
averaged an even 16 feet with
Crunke1ton’s zero giving little help.
Close Finish

All three relays left the spectators
in doubt‘ as to the winners. All
three were run in two separate heats
and‘ only the otﬁcial timers had an
idea of the comparative times of
each heat. - '

-- Exactly one second separated ﬁrst
and second place in the medley relay
(10 laps). The eight ‘lap’ relay was
even closer with nine-tenths of _a
second separating--the winning Fijis
from the Delts. And not to be out-
done by -the other relays, the 200
yard shuttle race was clocked with
eight-tenths of a second showing be-
tween the winners and the runners
up» — 6- 1 - -

The ﬁnal scoring showed Delta
Tau Delta Delta with 50 points; Phi
Gamma Delta, 38 points; Phi Delta
Theta, 22 points; Phi Kappa, eight
points; Lambda Chi, six points; and
Kappa Sigma, two points.

l

The game was the second of a

doubleheader in the first match of
which Duqnesne took over a stub-
‘born Fenn team, 5-0.
gwere turned back scoreless in the
{first two periods largely because of
:43 of goalie Barney Taylor’s 62
3 saves.

Pitt opened the second game ap-
parently bent on slaughtering the
hapless Tartans, but, although Mc-
Sorley’s proteges held a 4-0 lead at
the first buzzer, the Cathedral six
punched in only one goal in each
of the remaining periods.

Walter Lovett opened the scoring
with the second point of his col-
legiate career, slipping in Schi1deck-
er’s pass at 1:42. The Panthers went
scoreless for the next three minutes,
although Fieler made a neat save
of Bob Schooley’s shot at 4:12.

The respite was only temporary
for at 5:08 Schooley lifted the puck
into the net after taking Dick Fri-
day’s pass. Two minutes and two
seconds later, Shiring passed out
from the left corner of the arena
to Tatey Brittain who shoved the
disc past Fieler.

When Tech’s Barker went out for
checking Briodo into the boards at
8:54, the Panthers turned on the pow-_
er, ,but nothing happened. Barker
was back on the ice only six sec-
onds when"he tripped" Conick ‘ and
the heat was on again. Just ‘ as
Barker climbed out of the box," at
11:01, Ozzie Artz took Schooley’s
"pass, slithered around the back of
the Tech cage and edged in a score.

Friday set up the puck for Artz’s
score at 6:36 of the second period,
and Cusick backhanded a perfect
pass to Schooley at 3:25 of the final
12 minutes.

§Home Schedule

Pitts swimmers will close their
home season when they exchange
strokes with the Western Reserve
natators in the Metropolitan pool at
§~l:30 o’clock this afternoon.

The Western Reserve meet will be
 the ﬁnal Panther competitive prepar-
E ation for the defense of their Eastern

out their local varsity swimming ac-
tivities.

Otis and Pfnnder are the big wigs

Lederstein who has been beaten to
the tape only twice all season will
have trouble winning from Otis in
the -1-10. Pfunder will give Nowotny
plenty of trouble in the sprints.

.'~\.fte1- the Reserve meet, the Panth-

Eastern Championship, and a possi-
ble shot at the National Intercolle-
giates.

Winners and runner—ups in the
Eastern Championships will meet
the one-two men of the New Eng-
land championships. First and sec-
onds in this meet will be invited to
compete in the National Intercollegi-
ates. So while the Eastern Intercol-
legiates may be the season’s ﬁnal for
the Pitt swimming team, individual
members may continue competition.

Classical Club Entertains Dr. Ullman

The Classical Club headed by Doris Bauer, Ed40, held one of the

highlite teas of the year on Friday.

Dr. Ullman, head of the Classical De-

partment at the University of Chicago, and Dr. and Mrs. Scribner were the

guests of honor.

The deep fragrance of jonquils and tulips, which per-

vaded the hall, invited a steady stream of cooky-eaters to the twelfth ﬂoor

lounge. The classicists ask all those

Owl to Make Nationality Rooms
Theme of 1939 Student Yearbook

Theme of the 1939 Owl, now be-9

ing sold to undergraduate students, is
the Nationality Rooms and their sig-
niﬁcance to the students and the
community, explains Harold Vieh-
man, C39, editor.

“Featured with the book will be
25 extra pages devoted to the rooms,
ﬁve pages concerning Heinz Chapel,
and a greatly enlarged athletic sec-
tion explaining the ‘new intra-mural
sports program,’ ” he says.

“Most every undergraduate stu-
dent who has participated in Uni-
versity life will be represented.”
says Viehman.

USED THROUGHOUT

The Nationality Room theme will
be carried out throughout the book.
The Owl will try to further acquaint
all who read it with the Nationality
Rooms and their signiﬁcance.

The section especially devoted to
Nationality Rooms will feature pho-
tographs of the rooms and the na-
tionality committees, plus descrip-
tions of the rooms, their construc-
tion. and the color, art, and culture
in each. The pages of this section
will be decorated with the various
art motives from the rooms.

The athletic section will be en-
larged to permit several pages of in-
tra—mural pictures showing student
participation.

HUMAN INTEREST

According to Viehman, most of
group pictures have been taken in
informal poses and all stories are
being written with emphasis on the
human interest features of each or-
ganization. This is a distinct depart-
ure from the standard type photos
and stories of previous years.

Chapel Series Explained

“The Christian Tradition” will be
the theme of the Sunday University
chapel program to be conducted by
Dr. William R. Farmer. professor of
theology and new director of the ser-
ies, at the Heinz Memorial Chapel at
.2:30 o’clock.

“Inside every tradition, is a faith
which embodies a living person,”
commented Dr. Farmer. “Our duty
is to hand on a still richer tradition;
tradition is merely a shell for a liv-
ing faith.”

tute of Technology leaders is suc-

cessful.

Sixteen selected students of the
institute are now spending a fourth}
of their time in a program which will
ultimately require every student
there to study the social science as
well as technical engineering.

Dr. Robert E. Doherty, president of
Carnegie Tech, believes that the com-
plexities of modern life need profes-
sional men who can, ﬁrst of all, grap-
ple intelligently with intricate social
problems.

“Engineers who understand tech-
nology,” Dr. Doherty says “must give
more thought to the social consequen-
ces of their sciences. Engineering
adds fuel to the technological ﬂames
that illuminate and warm the whole
social community with physical com-
fort and convenience, but apparently
it has not occurred to the profession
that the ﬂame, though beautiful and
interesting, may yet consume us.”

“In feature writing you continue
your education, and you do meet a
great many interesting people,” said
Gilbert Love Wednesday at a con-
ference on journalism sponsored by
the Vocational Information commit-
tee of WSGA.

Love pointed out that the feature

article has a place between the
straight news story and ﬁction. In
the newspaper ﬁeld, there is the

news story with the feature lead, the
straight feature which is based on
interest rather than on timeliness or
importance, and the color story. _

Although he admitted that feature
writing is a limited ﬁeld, Love went
on to say that there is always room
for free lance features, particularly
in magazine work.

Stressing the importance of a gen-
eral education, he mentioned the
value of English, psychology, jour-
nalism, -and science courses.

Grace Bonaro, C41, introduced the
speaker.

School of Dentistry Reiereiice '1
l_.iln'ary Moves to New Q11a1'ters

By Lewis Riley
This year for the ﬁrst time the li-
brary’s 21,000 volumes of the Univer-
sity’s School of Dentistry library,

,have been brought together into one
‘building, the former Mellon Insti-

tute. Though this move the collec-

tion has been made available to all
University students and faculty mem-
bers, and residents and interns in
University hospitals.

RARE VOLUMES

Collected over a period of nearly
a half-century, the library today
ranks among the nation's outstanding
sources for medical and dental ref-
erence.

Included in the comprehensive col-
lection are such rare historical works
as a 1576 volume by a German, Zene
Artzney, which is the first known
work to be published pertaining to
the teeth. Also included is the first
general treatise ever written on the
anatomy of the teeth, a 1563 contri-
bution of Eusachius.

Interesting (and typical of early
American literary style) is “A Treat-
ise on the Human Teeth,” believed to

1 be the ﬁrst book on dentistry ever

published in America.
‘ON TEETH’

Its conscientious author, R. C.
Skinner, endeavors to “concisely ex-
plain their structure . . to which
is added, the most beneﬁcial and ef-
fectual method of treating all disor-
ders incident to the teeth and gums;
with directions for their judicious
extraction, and proper mode of pre-
servation interspersed with observa-
tions interesting to, and worthy of
the attention of every individual.”

Francis Bacon, van Leeuwenhoek,
Walther H. Ryff, Nicolaus Bertruc-
cius, J een Liebau1t—all outstanding

0

jpioneers in the dental professions
';struggle in alleviation of man‘s
;pain—are among the sixteenth and
5seventeenth century authors repre-
sented in the University collection.
Much of the credit for the rare and
expensive collection belongs to Dr.
H. Edmund Friesell, dean of the
school of dentistry, who presented
his private library of dental books
to the school in 1912. Since that
time Dr. Friesell has directed the ex-
pansion of the library, drawing
heavily upon European sources.
