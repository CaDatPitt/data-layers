Pittites Disinterested

As Bond Sales Lag;

The Student War Finance committee has announced that the
Seventh War Loan drive on campus will be extended until Friday,
This extension is made necessary by the fact that student

There have been many accusations recently that Pitt students are

man said, “Judging from the re-
sultslso far in the Seventh War
Loan, ‘Pitt _students are evidently
not aware that the United States
is still carrying .-on an expensive
war against Japan. This week is
their last chance to redeem them-
selves and to prove that they are
adult enough to realizethe gravity
of the situation and to shoulder
their share of responsibility in
bringing a quick and decisive end
to the war in the Pacilc.”

In another comment on the
situation, vice-chairman Louise
Johnson said, “The Allegheny
County War Finance committee,
under which the Pitt student com-
mittee operates, is .pleased with
the results of the Sixth War Loan
drive at Pitt -and is counting on us
to ﬁll our present quota of $9,200
-—less than one third of the $28,000
raised last fall. To fail them would
be to fail our country and disgrace
the University.”

Students are urged to have
their parents and friends buy
bonds through them and to put
every extra dime and quarter into
war sta-mps this week. A set of
six drawings of -the Commons
Room by Dr. Andrey Avinoif, di-
rector of -Carnegie Museum, and

Exhibition Shown
In Art Gallery

Yesterday afternoon marked the
openin-g of an exhibition of water
-col-ors ‘by Carol Bates in the sev-
enth ﬂoor art gallery. The work
of Miss Bates is well known
throughout the country. Her paint-
ings have been displayed in the
Pennsylvania Academy in Phila-
delphia an-d at the Cor-c-oran Art
gallery in Washington.

Robert Steen, art critic of the
Pitt News, -said that in many of
her examples, this artist has suc-
cessfully combined the natural
forms of reality with unreal forms
of the world of fantasy.

“The combination of delicate
pastel shades and vivid heavy
colors has been achieved with an
intense -degree of -sensitivity and
beauty,” said Bob. “The composi-
tion of most -of her pictures, as in
her Undersea types an-d as exem-
pliﬁed in Mystery, Fligh._t_ into
Eternity, Primeval, an-d Nostalgia,
reveal a dreamy, pristine quality
which characterizes the artistry of
Carol Bates.”

tion to the Essential Amino Acids.”
The ‘meeting is open to the public.

Dr. Murlin is professor of physi-
ology and director of the depart-
ment of vital economics at the
University of Rochester School of
Medicine and Dentistry.

Since so much attention is be-
in-g given to the importance of
protein feeding in the treatment
of various diseases, along with the
feeding of proteins to vi-ctims of
prolonged starvation, prisoners of
war and civilians in conquered
countries, his "topic is especially
timely.

Dr. ‘Murlin served as a lieuten-
ant-col-onel in the sanitary corps-
and was
‘appointed director of the food and
nutrition division of the medical
department of the United States
Army. At -present, he is a member

- many normal years.

 

The Editor,
The Pitt News

There are—or were——durin-g the
last two years only two activities
on the campus of this University
which presented the slightest chal-
lenge to students with intellectual
capacity, or at least pretensions
of such capacity. These activities
were the Men’s Debating associa-
tion and the Pitt News. We were
informed several days ago that
Men’s Debating association has
been sentenced to death.

These words, and those to fol-
low, -are undoubtedly colored by
passion, but we assure you that
the foundation for any such pas-
sion is logic and FACTS. Let us
examine the reasons suggested as
justiﬁcation for the elimination of
Debate: (1) its high cost; (2) the
small number of .participants; (3)

a coach cannot be spared from the,
(4) the speech depart- ’

faculty;
ment has been cut down by war
circumstances; (5) the war probi-
lems.

First, the paltry debate appro-.
priation of $200 is as nothing com-
pared to debate appropriations
during the depression.

Second, considering the total
enrollment of men under-graduates
more students actively participat-
ed in Debate this year than in
In normal
years the enrollment of men in
above ‘2‘0'0~0, and never more than
30 boys are active on the debate
team. At present the enrollment
is about 700», and about a dozen
‘boys have been active in Debate.

Fourth, all the more reason for
maintaining .a debate team —to
provide students interested in put -

lic speaking at least an informal,

opportunity to do so, if the Uni-
versity is unable to provide a
formal and accredited opportunity
for speech instruction.

Fifth, yes, but the crisis is past.
if we are to believe the news-
papers; the end is in sight; we

are approaching normalcy. If the .

authorities see ﬁt to maintain
Debate in the worst months of the

crisis, why kill it at the very,

moment the clouds begin to dis-
solve?

What do you say, students and
faculty? Debate represents ideas.
Ideas are America’s—-—the world’s
greatest resource. Eliminate them,

if you must, but consider the con-

sequences.
Sincerely yours,

Herman Feldman,
Gerald Stern.

Italian Class

In response to a petition pre-'
sented by a number of students,

J Professor W. H. Shelton, head of

the department of modern lan-
guages, has. announced that an in-
tensive course in beginning Italian
will be offered during the six

, weeks summer session, beginning

June 26. The class will meet three

hours daily, 8:30 to 10:00 o’clock
and 10:30“ to 12:00 o’clock, five days
a week. The language will be in
the curriculum for the ﬁrst time
since the United States entered
the war. The course will be taught
by Dr. Joseph A. Mastronie and
will stress the development of a

.speaking knowledge, but will in-

clude the essentials of grammar,

..presented in a functional, rather

than formal way.

Dr. Shelton has: also announced
that courses in elementary Rus-
sian (S1, 2) will ‘be given at the
summer sessions. This is the first
time such a course has ever been
oﬂfered in the daytime for regular
campus students. ’

them, so let’s not waste any more
space.

The Beta Sigs will award a ring
to the most outstanding senior

the Roosevelt hotel. Their spring
formal will take place Saturday
night, and as for vacation, several

will be on May 26, and the ﬁrst
week in June will ﬁnd the whole
fraternity at J amison’s cottage on
Lake Erie.

A big week end is in store for
the Delta Zetas over the 26th. On
Friday thy will have a formal at
the house; and on Saturday, Do-

Mary Jane Walko, Marilyn Pat-
terson, Betty Griffin, Roseann
Gianelli, Ruth Barton, and Mar-
gery Heinlein will be initiated. A
banquet at the Roosevelt will end
the evening, and every one will
stay at the house both nights.

The Phi Mus couldn’t decide
between a vacation at Asbury Park

mer so_me of the girls will be
found at both places.

Last Tuesday the Kappas held

their scholarship dinner at the-

Fort Pitt hotel when awards were
made to the most outstanding girl,

Profile Man

This week the chief Proﬁle man
on The Pitt News is doing a turn-

about, for, despite the fact that ".7:

he successfully hid his light under
a bushel, it has at last shone
through. Jim is far from new at
‘Pitt. By the time he was called to
the army in June, 1942, he had

completed his freshman year here.
After his induction he was sent
to Keesler Field, Miss., and from
there to Gulfport Miss. He serv-
ed as a personnel clerk in the
Air Corps and was later sent to
Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He
was discharged in June, 1943; now
he is a student at Pitt under the
veterans program.

Jim, who is an English major,
is interested mostly in writing; he
is a reporter on The Pitt News,
has written several songs which
are copyrighted, ‘but not yet pub-
lished, and intends to write ad-
vertising copy after the war.

Several weeks ago, Jim won a

staff member -of the school paper,
and the dramatic club.

Here at Pitt, J-une boasts a
string of activities as long as un-

she was copy -editor of the News
in addition to being assistant
editor of the Owl. In 19-43, June
and Ginny V-olk-ay were co-chair-
men of the Spring Festival, an
event which broke two precedents.
First of all, they were the ﬁrst
sophomores to have charge of
this annu-al event, and secondly,
the position in the past had al-
ways been monopolized by males
—-so that. shattered another tradi-
tion. ‘In this, her senior year,
June was tapped to the Hall of
Fame.

there any place on campus you

he was at the Pan-Hel Ball with
one woman and the Three-ring
Swing with another. If that isn’t
strictly big time, what is it?
BMOC? John’s list of activities in
the four years he’s been at Pitt
speaks for itself. There is space
here to mention only a few of
J ohn’s many activities. He worked
on dance «committees including the
freshman and sophomore dances
in 1942 and 1943. He was busi-
ness manager for 1942-43 Spring
Festival.

He served on Student congress
and was a Junior Worthy and
honorary Druid. J-ohn is past
treasurer of Phi Epsilon Pi social
fraternity and at present is presi-
-dent. However, the activity for
which he will be remembered
longest at Pitt is his work on the
Pitt News. John has been business
manager for the News for the past
two years.

‘On the Tap Day past, May» 4,
John was named the Senior
Awardee, an honor bestowed upon
the outstanding senior man "by the
Omicron Delta Kappa fraternity
of which he is the president. His ’
name is inscribed on ODK walk
leading to the Cathedral from
Heinz chapel.

John feels at home at Pitt and

certainly friendly and co-oper.a-

Page" sévian" T

By Larry Bondy

Thirty members of last year’s
football team attended a special
meeting called by Coach Clark
Shaughnessy on May 8, to ﬁnd
out what’s in store for them this
coming season. Tentative plans
put forth by Shaughnessy opens
the‘ practice season for all in-
coming freshmen on June 11,
along with the veteran quarter-
backs. The varsity men will get
under way July 2, with practice
lasting until August 3.

If practice makes perfect, Pitt
might have a team that -has at
last mastered the ‘T formation.
Practice sessions are scheduled
each. week day morning, with the
exception of Monday, from 9 to
11:30 o’-clock, and from 2:30 to
5:30 o’clock every afternoon.

Coach‘ .Shaughnessy emphasized
in his short talk that strict dis-
cipline‘ will be demanded and
each and every player must work

. hard. Shaughnessy added, “We are

not going to be the laughing stock
any 1-onger and use the war situa-
tion as an alibi; we are out to win
-games and will either get a foot-
ball team or die in the attempt.”

Pitt has done a lot of stumbling

Plans

in the last few years and it is
about time we get a winner. It
takes more than spirit and de-
termination to win, to gain vic-
tory; it takes material. Quite a
few years ago Southern California
handed ‘Stanford a 75 to 0 shel-
lacking. The next year the Stan-
ford team took an oath that
Southern California would never
beat them again, and they
haven't. ‘This Stanford team gain-
ed the name the Oath Team. It
isn’t the oath that has beaten
Southern Cal, but players. It will
take a .miracle man to make a
winner out of the present crop of
ball players. They haven’t the will
to win. Look at the Notre Dame
score of last year and that of
Ohio State; it shows that the boys
gave up after they were behin-d by
a couple of touchdowns. If we
intend to win we must start from
scratch. ‘

Shaughnessy inends to have a
varsity squad not to exceed 40
and give the members of the B
squad a chance to get on the
varsity, if they meet speciﬁcations.
Coaches for the coming season
are Stan Olenn, -Doc Hartwig, and
Bob Hoel.

With half the season gone, the
Panther baseball squad still seeks
its first vi-ctory of the current
campaign. Three contests have
gone into the books on the red
side of the ledger, Penn State,
Navy, and Bucknell. However the
Panthermen have been constantly
improving with experience and
before Coach -Mitterling’s men

hang up their spikes for the sea-
son, they may be able to produce
a victory or two. Games at home
with Bucknell this afternoon and
with Penn ‘State on Saturday, and
a trip to West Point on June 2still
remain on the local card. In pre-
vious engagements, the men of
Pitt dropped a 10-2 encounter t-o
Penn State in an ill-fated affair
lasting only ﬁve innings. Last
week the Blue and Gold’ dropped
games to Navy 12-8 in a very
close contest, and to Bucknell 5-2
in an equally close scrape.

Coach Mitterling will likely
start lefthander Bob Lucchino in
one of this week’s battles and
possibly lanky righthander Fred
Klein in the other. Bucknell will
likely send Mike McGuire to the
mound -again, McGuire owning
the Bison victory over Pitt. Coach
Bedenk pf the Nittany Lions may
counter with freshman Billy Hill,
his ace moundsman. The encoun-
ter with Bucknell starts at 3:30
o’clock at the stadium and the
State tilt at 2:00 o’clock on Sat-
urday afternoon.

HIGAIY-ILIGHTS or roux YEARS

It was a chill, grey November day.

‘7/te p  

By Ed Citron, Sports Editor

l+“ordham invaded the

Sit:-adiulm shouting, “Rose Hill to Rose Bowl;” even at 5-1, the

Panther was a bad bet.

Then Edgar ‘Special Delivery’ Jones

put on one of the greatest individual performances even seen in

the Bowl above Boquet street.

The Rain was taggetl with (

13-0 upset . . . Headlines of the game vied with the war nevi!
of the day. Pitt basked in the glory of its iteain.

1943 rolled around and the Blue and Gold had a tough time

ﬁelding a track‘ team. However,’

they organized one with Hap
Stickel as student-coach. That
spring they entered the Drake Re-
lays. Hap trotted his boys up to
Cleveland and entered himself in
the low hurdles. All he did was
to tie the world’s record in the
ﬁrst heat only to be disqualiﬁed
from the meet ‘because he was
listed as coach of the Panther out-
zﬁt.
* * *

Westminster rolled in boasting
a jinx. It was last February and
a Carlson-coached team hadn’t
beaten the Titans in their last
.eight encounters. That night court
history was made. ‘With Dodo Can-
terna pouring 37 points through
the hoop, the ice cream eaters wal-
loped Westminster 68-47. Can-
terna set a new city scoring mark
with his almost astronomical to-
tal. It was sweet. . . . Pitt snap-
ped a jinx and Dodo cracked a
record.

I'LL REMEMBER ,
Guys like: “Win ’em all” Carl-
son, the coach who won’t take
defeat for an answer; Frank Car-
ver, the one-man publicity de-

partment . . in the days when
we believed in publicity; and
genial Clark “T” Shaugnessy,

with that “T” meaning tops . .
stick with him, he’s going to have
a winner here.
ONE LAST TIME

Finally I turn to that peer of

seers, the Yogi:

Leaving this place, I’m worn and
wan,

As I look back on semesters gone.

I’ll miss the Gold Bar and nights
of fun,

’Specially Max, that son-of-a-gun.

And kids like Urs who made my
team,

I’ll always see in my ice cream.

For some things I’vc learned, I
must forget,

And frequenting bars is one, you
can bet.

Here’s to fond memories of the
past——

How’s this epitaph? Will it last?

“To start off this story, ~
Widespread was his glory.
First he only picked the games,
And then he dealt in names.
Next he chose one squad of
femmes,
Indeed, they were some gems,
Yet he must be cloaked in
shame,
In spite of former fame.
He prefaced stuff with his face,

Pal, that’s what clinched the,

case.”

1946 Publication Heads Named For Coming Year

Jim Johns

“Prez” would be an appropriate
nickname for James Johns, BA,
who will serve as business man-
ager for next year’s Owl. As of
this writing, genial Jim is presi-
-dent of Druids, president of Men’s
council, and newly elected presi-
dent of Delta Tau «Delta fraternity.

In addition to ‘being -a mem-
ber of IF council and a recent
ODK tappee, he has just com-
pleted a successful year as Owl
advertising manager. Jim came to
Pitt from Peabody high school,
where his activities included Bi-
ology club, Motor Trafﬁc club, and
Hi-Y.

‘This top-n-otch activities man
is also a veteran of World War II.
[After serving with an anti-tank
company of the 387th Infantry,
Camp Swift, Texas, Jim received
an honorable discharge and has
now returned to his studies like
many other Pitt Veterans.

g 49th and Harrison

LaRue Moss

Quiet hazel- eyed unassu-ming
LaRue Moss, C, has a genuine
interest in writing which will
serve her in -good stead as editor

of next year’s Owl. La‘Rue came
to Pitt from Wilkinsrburg High
School where she was sports
editor of the school paper, in ad-
dition to being .a member of the
Leader’s Club, acapella choir, and
other organizations.

Her activities here on campus
include Xylon, Heinz Chapel
choir, YWCA, and Pitkin club.
LaRue is also president of the
Lutheran Stu-dent association. She
has been working for the Owl
ever since her freshman year.

LaRue IS very fond of all sports
and enjoys a fast game of tennis
now and then in her spare time.
She also boasts a sizeable record
collection—which ranges fro-m
Bach to boogie woogie. Her tastes
in music are many and varied. As
a part-time job.

Betty Wolfe

Possessing ability way out of
proportion to her size (vshe’s ex-
actly ﬁve feet tall with heels on),
Betty Wolfe, BA, is admirably
suited to assume the editorship of
the News next fall.

Betty attended Verona High
School where she was edit-or of the
school year book and also Post-
Gazette reporter for the sch-ool.
Here at Pitt such activities as Phi
Mu fraternity, Xylon, Mort-ar
Board, an-d YWCA take up what-

ever spare time is left after her
weekly chores on the News.

‘Starting out as a reporter, she
was feature editor last fall, took
over the camp-us desk at mid-
term and has now succeeded to
the job of editor. Betty’s hobbies
are dancing and playing the piano,
and, according to those who should
know, she beats out some mean
Boogie Woogie on occasion.

Jack Bloom

The new business manager of
the Pitt News is Jack (Let’s-keep-
it-out-of-the-red) Bloom. A grad-
uate of Taylor Allderdice High
school, Jack studied pre-law at
the University of Michigan before
transferring to Pitt. At Michigan
U. Jack worked on the business
staff of the Michigan Daily.

At Taylor Allderdice he belong-
ed to the AAA, the Allderdice Ad-
justment association, an organiza-
tion similar to the Student congress
at Pitt. He also s-ang in the high
school choir.

VWhen Jack came to Pitt in June,
1944, he changed from pre-law
to business administration. On
May 11 he was initiated into the
Phi Epsilon Pi social fraternity.

As a pastime, when he has time
to pass, Jack writes to his many
friends in the service. He says,
“Believe me, that" takes a lot of
time. But every minute of it is

worth it.”
