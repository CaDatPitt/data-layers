Modeled From History

There has never been a need for
prompting lines in any Coronation ’
ceremony. , -

Pitt’s annual Coronation is mod-
eled from the ancient English cer-
emonies of the same type. Over the
years garments and other proper-
ties have been collected.

All members of the Senior Class
will wear white including 'Mis_s
Ritz. Miss Adele Marraccini will

ascend the throne in her royal robe .

and then place the orb, ring, sep-
ter, robe, and ﬁnally the crown
upon the new Queen.

the clinching proof: The Wright & Ditson is the only
oﬂicial tennis ball usé’d in all U.S.L.T.A. National
Championships (since, 1887). Official, too,‘ in all U.S.
Davis Cup Matches. Official adoptions of its twin,
the Spalding, in other leading tournaments" assure
their championship stature in American tennis. Play

Old Newsies Don"r Die’

TheyJust Get Drafted

By Tim Kovar

This may be the ﬁrst and last of the written “Goodbye’s to
Pitt” this year. It may get sentimental, I hope it won’t be bitter.
I hope it will express a few of the thoughts of the 1000—o1d students
who will soon, be graduating although it may reﬂect only the
personality of one person who has? enjoyed a full and complete
college life. I will not express the desire to repeat these last four
years since they could never be repeated under the ' ~

Years ago, several seniors were asked if they
would send their offspring to Pitt. There were
positive replies that verged on idyllic concep-
‘tions of what college life might be and negative
answers ‘that reflected the bitterness of frustra-
tion accumulated over four years of striving to

article may be a combination of both views tem-
pered with an_“in between” expression that must ~
be qualiﬁed by circumstances. Frankly, my kids will ’have their

"choice -of colleges if I can afford it, but I’ll certainly not discourage"

them from coming to Pitt. I’m not regretting my choice.

My experiences at Pitt have been varied; at times ‘they have
been little short of wonderful, at times they have been uneventful,
and of course there are some bitter memories. But as I said, I
won’t be bitter and I’m not sorry for any of it. Naturally, my under-’
graduate days were inﬂuenced by fellow students but perhaps peo-
ple.on the faculty and administrative staff had, more to do with
myeducation than can_be said for_ most students. Through the work
on The—Pitt News and other activities, I_ was fortunate enough to

A be closely associated with many of these older people during the

formal hours of the working day and the informal times oftheir

"social life. I enjoyed the privilege of calling many of "them by their

first names- and ‘I'm thankful that their personalities were large
enough to include the association of a far younger and less ma-

_’ fture person. Those experiences wereof such nature that they could
not be duplicated in classroom work or evening study and their

value cannot be disputed in,‘ the computation of acquired knowl-
edge. , A _. I ' ‘
Some of these people are gone from Pitt now, They will be
remembered by some but merely names  others. Robert X. Graham
died last year and left an irreplaceable gap in the ranks of the really

A outstanding members of this University. Lester Brailey and Dick

Cassiano have gone on to‘other ﬁelds and they will be joined ‘by
the likes of Al ‘Payne and a few others who have held special
places in the hearts of students and faculty alike. In ‘our opinion,
they cannot be replaced for their individual worth but their posi-
tions will be filled by men who may assume like_ proportions to
students still here and those yet to come.

There are others who will remain at Pitt after this year and
will continue to aid and instruct the students under them. Dr,.Don
Swarts, Charles Elliott, Dick Cunningham, and -Dean Biddle will
beback next year to cope with the endless problems of streams ‘of
students. And they’ll impart their special and human guidance to
the individual people rather than set up rules for the leadership
of masses. ' ' -

'Fran Pray, Max Elder and Jane Shaw will continue to work
quietly and effectively in the Public Relations Oﬁ‘ice and continue
to be unknown to the great number. of students. And only the
ones who know them and work with them will really appreciate
their eﬁorts for the University. There are others, too numerous
to mention, who have contributed more than was required in the
daily lesson plans and though they are not named here, they will
be remembered for what they did and what they tried to do for us.
There. are others. too, who will be remembered for opposite reasons
and will not be named here and will be forgotten’ as soon as possi-

‘ble. But I’m being bitter and I said I wouldn’t be bitter.

There are many students who‘ have contributed to the excite-
ment of the college years but namingthern here would be an im-
possible task. Their worth will be remembered by the things they
have done for ~Pitt and the records they have left on the‘ walks,

’on the plaques in the halls, the ‘pages of the Owl and Pitt News

and the minutes of . many Student. Congress, WSGA, and Men’s
Council meetings. _ A _

. They may be vague faces to the students who are taking their
places but to we who worked with them they.will be recollections of-

events, Christmas Formals, Religion—In—Life, Notre Dame rallies, '

trips to Michigan State and Army, the ﬁght for "political parties,
the naming of various Queens, nights in the Greeks and days in
the Tuck'Shop and dean of men’s oﬂice. They will be remembered
with sentiment and the knowledge that knowing these people, was
part of our education.

Even closer and moreipersonal to me areithe associations gained
from spending four years on a college newspaper. Pitt News mem-
bers are traditionally accused of operating in a tight little world of
their own that refuses admission to the majority of the students.
That is true in one sense of the, world. The News is completely
diﬁferent from any other college organization and its members must
be different. - ’ .

We, are thrown together constantly by our work and we must
adjust to inumerable personalities and impossible situations. Our

Aworkgoes on all day and far=into the night when tempers are

short and the hours drag endlessly. This year, we were a younger
group because the veterans who had previously guided the paper

had gone and only one or two “grandaddies” remained to temper.

the exuberance that knew no limits. We worked hard but played

.even harder. We were crazy idiots one minute and deadly efficient

newsrnen the next. We cut classes, stayed  all night, borrowed
notes, went to exams cold, skipped meals, sweated over term papers
at the end of the years, borrowd money for lunches and carfare,»
argued violently over sex, virtue and politics and got roaring drunk

on occasion. There were tears and beers and wild escapades. There
«were plenty of serious moments when we ‘were “let in” on Uni-

versity doing and given tremendous. responsibility by the Chancellor

or the-deansg Wehad our fun and plenty-of worries and still put.

were the closest bunch of people
at Pitt and wehadahellilva good
time; _ ’
Now there is another, group
taking over for us-“on the News,

r just as every organization is be-

ing revamped with new and
younger people. They will en-
counter similar circumstances,
work with comparable People

and experience the same things
» we did but in their own way.

Right now, they cannot see them-
selves as we remember ourselves
last year; and we are, in their
eyes, stale, old-fashioned seniors
who are reluctant to give up their
college years in spite of vigorous
avowals that “I’ll never miss the
old joint.”

Allof us are leaving something
behind that we do not wish to
lose, but, atthe same time, we
are making way for other people
to try their hands at running the
University. We hope they won’t
be discouraged by red tape and
restrictions, frustrations and dis-
appointments and complete fail-
ure at some stage of the game.
Its all necessary-and tremend-
ously maturing and now we can
say that it was all fun, too. Even

I ime I 0 Put Away    A
Th Th’ S ' f Ch°|c|  
By Jim Bender I 4  P"

“When I was a child, I spoke as a child," I understood as a child,

I thought as a child. But,2when I became a man, I ‘put away they-_'
things of a child.” ’ 
The Spring which came around so quickly in other years'meaI1;’e'."i 
nothing more than a pause in the process of education, but 
Spring there is ‘a different feeling;-"for now it is time for _the,_

senior to put away the things of a child and accept the role of
man; Naturally, there is no sharp transition between col1ege..and333’;

-tr

   

   
  
  
      

that is set off as marking the end of the formal period of l_e_;arn-.-‘ 
ing of the child. - .. l = ‘7
These things of a child—-all theV'happen-
ings, all ‘the incidents, all the joys, all the
. plans of college life——are‘ not childish; in-
stead they are childlike, for it is only by /
their_innocent quality that they become dis-
tinguished from the world of_ the mature.
College is the season for the young tree to
blossom, but the harvest will come only in
the Fall of manhood. ‘

It is_ now: time for an evaluation of these ,_
lastfour years, and after much probing and weighing I have de
cided_ that any fair evaluation I make must be able to answer thes
three questions: _ ' A "

1. /What .have I accomplished? ,,

2. What» would I change? , 

3. What impressions am I carrying away? — 4 ’ "V , ll,“

My accomplishments‘ are meager in the academic oledgeroand-,5
my’ activities would not. make, an impressive list, yet.I still |;fe_'e H 
that I have accomplished by main purpose h_ere:'to' get an eddga-,4 
tion. This education has been a" composite of formal lectures,‘ ; .
formal bu1l—sessions, coffee in the "Tuck Shop, nights -without" sleep 
to ﬁnish assignments, dancesin the Commons Room, and, strangely” ‘'
enough, cutting classes. - "I  ‘ 

 

There was one activity, too, and to me it was the best part‘  ' 
of college. That activity_ was the Pitt News. ‘Technically, it,’  I A ‘
taught me as much, if not more, than any class I, attended. .- j~
Mentally, ' it taught me how to think and _i_iow to act. 'P,syg, 
cholbgically, the News taught me how.to get along with people.‘-f ,;v'
I don’t mean that it ”taught me how to avoid frictionewe had.
some of that-—but it did teach me "not to allow friction to  
disrupt the organization. We had squabbles and ‘pettiness ‘at:;.,_'
times but in the end we always ‘united"forv the ultimate end.-‘— “F”
to put out the best student newspaper we could. .  

The second point of the evaluationoisz What would I c‘hang,e?5':_
I cwould not -attempt to list the ,minor irritations which  have’; -
found at Pitt. The crowded elevators,-‘the silly ~housing’rules fo_r7 ‘
women, and ‘the crowded Tuck Shops are only three of the doizensvfo.
of things which could be changed;‘_but whether they continue 
exist or not isn’t important in the overall picture. What I W.OCl1d:‘»
try to change is some of the broader aspects of University _lif,e,.".-A I
First, I would strive to promote a closer relationship betweeri‘ '
student and instructor. With ‘few exceptions the student now knovsfs

 

v.

 
 

This is not to suggest that the student should call the instructor, 
by his ﬁrst name in class or that the instructor should inquire 

 

a person. A ,.
The second change which is needed‘ is more harmony be-. ‘V -.
tween the individual instructors and between the departments. ”
It is common knowledge around Pitt that certain departments. 1. ,
carry on “feuds” and that certain instructors, feel that they  
are overworked. -Obviously, this is n%t good for the ,Univers'ity,?, _ 
and what affects the University eventually islpassed down the’ /I7 to

impression willobe that of the magnitude of Pitt. I admit that-lthis‘,
is not an original observation, but it seems to be one that s_trikés

founduhere. No matter how noisy or bustling it is on the streets
the_interior of the University always seems serene. V A 
My last impression will be one of sadness, ‘but it will n0t,.b_e -

Enlarged Tourney This Season
Gives Panthers New Chance. -

By STEVE BUTCHOK
Although the Panther mittmen have a mediocre record

 

based on pre-season predictions, their chances of reaching

the NCAA playoffs for the second straight year may be better
than most observers think. _
This year, due to the fact that the ﬁeld of the tourna-

ment is to be expanded to allow moresteams to participate,
Coach Sarge Mitterling’s squad could get an invite with a
good showing against tough east-¢

 

ern foe, Navy, this Saturday at
Annapolis, Md., and in the ﬁnal
three games of
the season.

Duquesne will
be met in the

gagement Mon-
day, May 25,
and Penn State

But in all
these games, the
Panthers will be

their ﬁrst game over the Mittmen
in the past three seasons by a 4-3
score. ‘

And in Monday’s game with Du-
quesne, fastballing Dick Ricketts
hurled his fourth consecutive win
of the season. allowing the Pan-
thers only three scattered hits in
shutting them out, 8-0.

So, it appears that the loss of
Kyle has hampered the offense of
the Mittmen considerably. They
have been able to collect only eight
hits in the last two games while
scoring a total of three runs, and
with the remainder of the schedule
showing games against the bigger
narn__e schools, the Mittmen will be
pressed to win. , ' '

One bright spot with the willow,
however,..has been catcher Milt
Emery who is currently batting
.333 with 17 hits out of 51 trips to
the platter.

golf squads have important

matches in theoﬁing tomorrow as the netters take on W.&J.
at Mellon Park and the duffers travel to Annapolis where

they meet Navy in a crucial tilt.

Both squads were successful in
their latest outings as they racked
up impressive victories.

Coach Jim Tully’s tennis squad
decisively beat the Washington &
Jeﬁerson netmen 8-1, Saturday at
the Mellon Park courts. The Pan-
thers swept all but one singles
match as they showed excellent
form.’

The Panther linksrnen beat St.

Journey to Puerto Rico
Floor Card Feature

A long between—semesters road trip climaxed by two
games with the University of'P_uerto Rico is the feature of
the University of Pittsburgh’s‘l95/1-55 basketball schedule

MANAGERS MEET
Interfraternity athletic man-
agers will meet today in room
236 C1 at 3:30 p.m. Discussion
will center around a golf and

tennis tournament and man-
agers are requested to come to

   

What I learned. in. four years of college ought to ﬁll a
book, though a very thin one, and what I did not learn ought

/_, to ﬁll several ‘more (the same books to be found under a

ﬁlm of dust on my shelf), but three years on this paper af-

-( ' forded_ a chance to -learn a little "more than I would have

otherwise.‘ ~ , , . ,
Although geology taught me not to take every rock

for granite, history revealed that bygone politicians be-
haved as shabbily as they do today, and psychology
proved that infantfsohave 1ess.fu_n in infancy than adults
have in adultery, my best experiences came in observing
and reporting the elements of the sports scene.

7 For one who hopes to go into professional writing, it is
said that newspaper .work, even on a student journal, is
the best possible training for the beginner. Thefreporter learns how
to evaluate people and events and thus he supplements his class-
Work with actual experience. '

He makes mistakes at ﬁrst, though. I recall the time I asked

, Red Dawson what- he planned in preparation for a game the
season before last. He answered with the classic: “Well, I’m'
going to work on owe-fense a little, and some on defense.” I
consoled myself later, however, when one of the downtown
writers fell into the same trap. -

I found, too, that theoathletic policy in regard to scholarship is
one that Pitt followers can be proud of, especially when you consider
the low academic standards required in other schools, even though
it’s tough on the coach when one of the boys he is counting on
ﬁnds the book more cumbersome than the ball.

These ‘are by no means the only important things I have
picked up here-—I only mention them in passing—but space limits
us to only general observations. Chieﬂy, it might be pointed out
that if these sports pages—-or the whole paper, for that matter—
sometimes does not come up to standard, it is due not to. lack of

A conscientious effort but more because of the pressure of studies
- and lackof sleep.

cation,‘- not to everemphasize ‘extra-curricular activities, which is
preciaselythe reason why I am so well—versed in geology, history, and
psychology_ -

released today.

In addition to the Puerto Rico trip, which will mark the
ﬁrst time a Pitt team has appeared outside the continental
limits of the United States, games also are scheduled with

the Universities of Miami and
Tampa. Tampa is a new name on
the Pitt schedule, while Miami has
not been met since 1950-51.

In December, Duquesne, Ford-
ham and George Washington will
be guests at the fourth annual
Steel.Bowl at the Pitt Field House.
It will be the third Steel Bowl ap-
pearance for the Dukes and the
ﬁrst for Fordham and George
Washington.

Colgate and Duke University
also return to the Pitt schedule
after absences of several years.

Holdovers from the 1953-54'sea—
son include Ohio State, Michigan,
NYU, Syracuse, Army and Navy.

A unique feature of the sched-
ule is the fact that the basketeers
will not miss any classes because
of trips. The big journey will be
at mid—year and the other away

the meeting with rosters of
those who will participate in
these sp arts.

Thinclads Will Try for Another
Record-Breaker at Ohio State  

By , GENE AROMATORIO

Fresh from a convincing 712/3-591/3 victory over Notre
Dame, Acting Coach Lloyd Duff and the Panther thinclads
invade Ohio State University Saturday to seek their third
dual meet victory of the season. Since Ohio State is Duff’s
alma mater, the ‘youthful tutor is looking forward to this
meet. “ . .

In their most recent meet, the Buckeyes lost by a wide
margin to Miami of Ohio while 7
managing to .\cop only four ﬁrsts
out of 14 events. Pitt fans will re-
member that the Panthers dropped
their meet with Miami by only 1%
points. If this is any indication of

Ohio’s strength, the Pittites should

noon.

Last Saturday, the Blue and
Gold thrilled" an estimated 500
track enthusiasts at the Stadium
with a record—shattering perform-
ance against the power-packed No-
tre Dame trackers.‘

Leading the record breakers,
and there were nine, was ace
