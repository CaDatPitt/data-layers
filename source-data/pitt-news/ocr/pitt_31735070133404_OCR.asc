board director of PPC. “I think that one
thing that will make the trip is all the Pitt
students going down to support the team.
It’s estimated that there willbe over 200
students in attendance.” _

Also included in the trip’s expenses
are discounts on Universal Studios tickets,
free shuttles to Pleasure Island and
Universal Studios’ City Walk and free
shuttles to the various theme parks in
Orlando.

According to PPC adviser Tom

You’ll be down there with a lot of other Pitt
fans to cheer the team on to victory,”
Wydra added.

A refundable $25 damage deposit per
person is required- Sign-ups started
Monday in the PPC Oﬂice, M-30 WPU.

your checkbook ready. .

Through Council Travel, located at
118 A Meyran Ave., a ﬂight leaving

Pittsburgh on Dec. 19 and returning on

Dec. 23 is about $230.

Students who wish to return sooner are
going to have to dish out a lot more cash.
A ﬂight departing Pittsburgh on Dec. 19
and returning on Dec. 21 costs more than
$900. Flights are limited, so act fast.

Travelocity estimates that the cheapest
ﬂight leaving Dec. 19 and returning Dec.
21 was $293, but the ﬂight departs Orlando
at 5:30 am. A later afternoon ﬂight, non-
stop through USAirways, is $928.50.

Another option on making the voyage
down to Orlando for the Tangerine Bowl is
a road trip with friends. This requires a
comfortable vehicle for the long drive, a lot

of gas money, an ample supply of food and .

beverages and the patience to weather traf-
ﬁc jams, breakdowns and the other passen-
gers in the car.

And for those who wish to arrive in
Orlando armed with fruit, there are several
stores around Oakland to sell you -that cit-
rus delight The Giant Eagle on Centre
Avenue, Groceria Merante on Bates Street
and the Oakland Community Deli on
Atwood Street are a few stores where you
can ﬁnd your tangerines and other citrus
fruits.

The annual Cathedral of Learning
Commons Room Holiday Open House
on Sunday afternoon celebrated cultural
diversity and featured Pitt’s 26 nationality
rooms adorned in traditional holiday
style. V

The third ﬂoor of the Cathedral has
more to offer than the initial heaving
lungs and shortness of breath most feel as
they’ scale the ﬁnal set of stairs. The
nationality rooms there and on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor were transformed to reﬂect their
respective ethnic holiday customs, and
tours have been open to the public since
Nov. 18. V

Jen Stephan, a tour guide stationed
for the afternoon in the Chinese class-
room, explained some of the Chinese cus-
toms to curious children, including the
fact that a Mickey Mouse ornament hangs

, on the Christmas tree to represent the year

of the mouse. -

“What’s great about doing this is that
everyone is soenthusiastic about learn-
ing, whether they’re young or old,”
Stephan said.

Sunday’s open house also included a
food festival with treats from countries all
over the world such as spinach pies and
hummus from the Syria-Lebanon table,
Indian sarnosas and Chinese lo mein.
Along with representatives from ethnic
restaurants, people sold jewelry and other
crafts. .

For those who don’t go to cultural
events just for the food, the entertainment

was also a draw. Dancers representing six _'

different areas of the world performed a
wide variety of shows. From the Chinese
children doing the -“Melody of
Movement” to the older Scandinavians

- executing what resembled an early form

of the square dance.
For many of these groups, the holi-
day open house is just one out of many

MTV looking for a few unique souls

‘ RICK NEFF.
Staff Writer

They came in droves.

Black, white, preppy, punk, bald
and bleached — they arrived search-
ing for their 15 minutes of fame and a
chance to cavort naked in a hot tub on

a cable television.

Saturday afternoon, Bunim—

Murray, the production company

responsible for MTV’s hit shows
“The Real World” and “Road Rules,”
took over Rock Jungle at Station
Square to hold auditions for “Real
World: Las Vegas” and “Road Rules
11.”

After 10 on-air seasons, the
granddaddy of reality television
showed no sign of declining popular-
ity. The auditions were held between
10 a.m. and 5 p.m., but some people
claimed to have been in line since 1
a.m. Friday.

By 10 a.m., Rock Jungle’s park-
ing lot was the hippest place in
Pittsburgh. Gray skies and a chilly
breeze couldn’t stop the line that
stretched the length of the building
and around two red and black dump-
sters. Women wearing tiny skirts with

' knee-high boots huddled together to

stay warm, while swaying to the

  

 
  

 

  

 

music that was being played by a

Chevy Blazer with “105.9 The X”

painted on the side.

No one pushed and shoved, but
bouncers guarded the doors as they
let people slowly trickle into the
empty club. Throughout the day, the
line did not shrink. More and more
18- to 24-year-olds stepped out of
their cars and into the back of the
line. Those who finally stepped inside
were shocked to see that they were
only halfway through the wait. There
the line“, wove past the piranha tanks,
slithered past the pythons and con-
strictors before ending behind the
faux waterfalls.

Auditioners were given applica-

tions to ﬁll out that included ques-

tions such as, “What is your most
embarrassing moment?” and “How do
you approach a relationship?”

At the end of the line, “The Real
World” wannabes were greeted by
Mike, a cast member of “The Real
World: New York.” With boy band
looks and a friendly smile, women
screamed his name and ran up to hug
him.

Pitt Juniors Monika Puranik and
Sara Burton waited in line for nearly
four hours, but said that seeing Mike
helped. Both students are fans of the

show and try to watch every episode.

“When I saw him, I was freakin’
out,” Burton said.

When people reached the end of
the line, they sat at a table 12 at a time
for their interviews. The interviewing
process was done in one of three
round-table discussion groups.

At one table, Morgan Fahey con-
ducted the mass interview. Fahey is
the supervising casting director for
“The Real World.” Arniable and out-

going, she appears to harbor a love

for the show.
Fahey’ gushed about how people
should watch the just completed

' “Real World: Chicago” in January.

When pressed for details, all she
would say is that it is the first house
with both a Jacuzzi and a doublehead-
ed shower. ‘

“Look for the best ‘Too Hot for
TV’ Real World tapes,” she said.
J Still, sex ddesn’t always sell — at
least not in the interviewing process.

One group of auditioners includ-
ed a gorgeous woman who claimed to
have a large porn collection. She tried
to dominate the entire discussion
group by professing her love for all
things pornographic. -

In between talking about ho
much pot they smoke, almost every-

one else in the group agreed that porn
was “just great.” One girl disagreed.

She called pornography degrad-
ing to women.

Every one around her seemed
shocked at the suggestion. Still, the
girl held her ground. When the inter-
view was over, Fahey liked her the
best.

Fahey explained that most people 

auditioning try to put on a show. They
talk about how much drugs they do or
how much sex they have. Most of it
isn’t true, she said.

“We like people who -» are both
interesting and sincere, I felt that the
girl who had such strong /views
against pornography wasn’t putting
on an act and was the most interesting
person of that group,” she said.

By 3230 p.m. more than 800 peo-
ple auditioned. The bouncers let
another 100 into the club then locked
the doors. -As the line inside dwindled
down, the bouncers cleaned up the
signs on the walls and grabbed a beer.
Fahey said she would make the deci-
sion about who to call back later that
night.

When asked about their chances
for being picked for the show,
Puranik and Burton chanted in unison
“slim to none.”

Women find allies in

SYDNEY BERGMAN
Staff Writer i

. Fourteen women met in the Kurtzman
Room of. the William Pitt Union Sunday to
talk about grief, sadness and fear.

Carol Hershey and others at the
Women’s Resource Center of Greater
Pittsburgh saw “Woman to Woman:
Developing allies, resources and strength
in a time of international crisis” as a way

,for women to voice concerns about the
Sept. 11 attacks.

Woman to Woman included young
and middle—aged women, who gathered to
speak both in large groups and one—on-one

_ about their emotions following the attacks.
The Women’s Resource Center, Pitt’s
‘Women’s studies program and Campus
Women’s Organization co—sponsored the
forum.

Hershey said that the forum’s goals
were “self—awareness cross-cultural
awareness, awareness ‘ of existing
resources and support for identifying and

' creating goals, resources and actions.”

Topics of discussion ranged from fear
of teenage sons being sent to war to need-
ed changes in national policy to a spiritual
response to Sept. 11 events.— '

 

  time of grief, sadness

Cultural sensitivity and ways to
respond to ethnic intimidation also ﬁgured
highly on the agenda. One of the organiz-
ers, local activist Janet Syphan, said that
the discrimination against Arabs hit home
for her. In response to racist remarks said
to her after the tragedy, the 1999 Pitt alum-
na said, “Excuse me, I’m Syrian. Why do
you think you can talk to me that way?”

As part of a psychological, spiritual
and emotional reaction to Sept. 11 and the
bombings in Afghanistan, the attendees
also mentioned their anger, pain and feel-
ings of isolation.

“People in my generation — we’ve
never been afraid,” said junior Julia
Shahda. She recounted her experience Vis-
iting New York City. “I looked to the sky-
line and thought,. ‘This is New York
now.”’ - .

. Others expressed their frustration with
the U.S. government.

Christine Haas, president of the
Women’s Resource Center, commented
that the current policy was to tell people to

-visit New York and go shopping. Eliciting

laughter from the others, she said of the
message to the public, “[It means] let the
government bomb, we’1l shop.”

  Indian ambassador—at-
large celebrates unity

1

GREG HELLER—LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

When Bhishma Agnihotri left
his post as the only Indian dean of a
United States law school, he had a
vision.

“The vision was: In the new
world, in our global perspective,
boundaries are losing their mean-
ings,” he said.

Now Agnihotri is India’s ambas-
sador-at-large, working, as he said,
“part—time for India.” He and other
community political figures came
together to celebrate the acts of the
Indian community both before and
after Sept. 11 at the Speak Out
Against Terrorism at the Soldiers’
and Sailors’ Memorial on Saturday.

Agnihotri, who was chancellor
of the Southern University Law
School, said /that the offer of a posi-
tion as an ambassador came as a
surprise to him, since he had worked
in the United States for more than
25 years. He said that, as an Indian,
he felt ‘a close tie to the ‘United

States.

“We have similar experiences
that America has,” he said, pointing
out that democracy, free elections
and “freedom of spirit,” are charac-
teristics common to both countries.
These similarities, he said, made
Sept. 11 — which he called “the
most tragic experience of my life”
-— even harder on the Indian com-
munity. ’

“We as Indians were doubly
pained,” Agnihotri said.

Joining him as a speaker was
county executive Jim Roddey, who
recounted his experience on Sept.
11.

An emotional Roddey recalled
the phone call during which he
heard that a hijacked plane was 10
minutes outside of Pittsburgh, and
his reaction to the idea that it was
his choice whether to evacuate the
larger buildings in the city.

“Never did I think that I’d be
faced with a decision like that,”

play bingo with students

JAMES DEWEESE
Senior Staff Writer

In a corner of C—side Cafeteria

Thursday night, bingo did what
lightning rarely does: It struck
twice in the same spot.

A_s Hyniea Gardner, the
evening’s first — and second/—
winner approached the front of the
room to claim her prize,» she joked
that winning at bingo had always
been one of her dreams.

She kept the first prize, a glow-
in-the-dark bubble—blowing putty
kit, for herself, and let one of her

__-friends have the other, a shower

lotion set.

Gardner, a freshman — who by
her own admission would otherwise
have been in the library doing
research and who eventually took
home four prizes‘ —- said, “It’s
always been a dream for me to
shout ‘Bingo!’ at the top of my
lungs.” H

Deborah Walker, communit
relations and crime prevention offi-

cer for the Pitt police wanted to be_

a winner too, calling out to
Gardner, “Can you get me some

numbers for the Super 6 [lottery] on

Saturday?”

This type of friendly interaction
between students and police offi-
cers forms an important part of a
new initiative from the Pitt police
called the Residence Officer
Program. . .

. Walker, an 18-year veteran of
the Pitt police force, said she devel-

. oped the program to bring officers

and students together in a way that
badges and citations
wouldn’t.

“I wanted for our students to get

. to know us other than in our official

capacity,” Walker said. “We’re not
onlyihere to arrest you, but also. to
be your friend.”

According to Walker, the pro-
gram assigns officers and supervi-
sors to each of the student residence
halls. The officers then organize
meetings and ask for student‘ input

with regard to what they would like ’

to get from police presence,
Students go to the meetings for
different’ reasons. Most go out of
personal interest, but according to
officer Michelle Spolnik, who vol-
unteered to call bingo numbers
along with fellow officer Tracy
Harasyn, the Judicial Board some-
times orders students to attend the
R.O.P. meetings as punishments.

q Spolnik added that she believes stu-

dents have responded well to the
program. -

Student input from these meet-
ings has already helped shape the
program, Walker said, pointing to
the collared shirts that she and the
other officers wore instead‘ of their
regular uniforms. Walker said stu-
dents requested the change to create
a friendlier atmosphere.

Walker said input from students
and,Residence Life will continue to
shape the program to a largeextent.
She also said that different student
desires will make for a variety of
programs at each of the residence
halls.

For instance, Walker said stu-
dents in Sutherland Hall expressed
an interest in developing an

amnesty program at Pitt, similar to .

the one already in place at Carnegie
Mellon University.

As ‘the amnesty program oper-
ates -at CMU, if students are
involved in a drinking incident
where medical attention becomes
necessary, students can call the
police without themselves being
cited for underage drinking.

In response to the request,
Walker said Pitt police would con-
tact the CMU officials to discuss
their‘ policy. But she said any
change in policy would be subject
to approval from Pitt police and
University administrators. .

According to Walker, students

. from Forbes Hall requested a mock

trial program. The program, which
Walker’. said would probably take

place sometime after winter break, G

will educate students about the var-

-ious aspects of police work from

arrest to trial. .

Emily Aubele, assistant director
of Residence Life, stressed the
importance of. this educational com-
ponent of the program.‘ _

“Police officers are about more
than crime,” she said. ‘‘They’re
about education and community

.involvement'.’’ _ _
Aubele has also requested, that

the R.O.P. officers assist in some of
the hour-long study breaks
Residence Life has organized to
entertain students during exam
week. :. ‘ ‘

Walker said she hopes to expand
the program beyond» the residence
halls; Although she said Bouquet
Gardens and. other off-campus
venues might pose logistical diffi-
culties, shesaid she is excited “for

Unlimited, had a contact with the
Make-A-Wish Foundation and when
they were combined with LTDbo.oks,
it just came together,” Haas said.

“Fairies and Pixiedust” is an
illustrated collection of poetry that
Haas wrote in high school while she
was being home-schooled.

“The book is happy, just plain
old happy,” Haas said. “I think that a
lot of people don’t appreciate what
they have. This is my way of show-
ing that I do. I thought about adding
to the book, but it just didn’t add
anything to the theme. I wrote it
when I was 16 and now I’m 21, sol
thought it sounded better the Way it
was.”

“‘Fairies and Pixiedust’ is dedi-
cated to all of the people who have
helped me live this life, loving every
minute of it. This work is also

yours.”

Haas is writing another poetry
book called “Now That We Are
Starting,” about surviving college
and how.to handle college life.

Two other books that Haas wrote
are also in the works. “Life, the Stuff
That Art is Made Of” is up for review
by Simon Schuster/Harper Collins.

Agent Katinka Matson, co-
founder of Edge magazine, is

reviewing the other, titled “Breath of

Angels.” “Breath of Angels” is co-
authored by Roger Zahab and focus-
es on the idea that music has the abil-
ity to make people happy.

For “Breath of Angels,” Haas‘

studied music performance at the
Vienna Conservatory in Austria for
about six weeks. I

“The project has a very interna-
tional scope in that we’re looking at
doctors in France, Canada, [the]
U.S., a few in Spain, England and
China,” Haas said. _

Haas went to Vienna on the
Austria Nationality Room scholar-
ship over the summer of 2000.

Haas is working on her bache-
lor’s degree with a triple major in
music, interdisciplinary studies and
natural sciences with a focus on mol-
ecular genetics. _

A music lover for years, Haas
plays the piano and the violin.

“I’m also the director of the First V

Degree, the school newspaper for the
College of General Studies for non-
traditional students,” she said. “I was
a staff writer for about a year, then I
was asked to be the director this
year.” '

Roddey said.

Roddey and the speakers were
quick to find a hope in the communi-
ty’s response.

“The most gratifying thing that has
come from this horrible tragedy is to
see our community come together and

stand together,” Roddey said, “and this .

is a great example here today.”

U.S. iRep. Mike Doyle, a
Democrat from the Pittsburgh area,
also spoke of unity and praised the
Indian community’s involvement.

“The magnitude of this moment in
our history calls us to come together,”
he said. , ’

A common theme of the speakers
was preventing prejudice in the wake
of the attacks.

Sunil Wadhwani, CEO and co-

founder of iGate Corporation, spoke of
the fear and anger directed toward
“people who merely looked like those
who committed the attacks.”

State Sen. Tim Murphy, who rep-
resents parts of Allegheny County and
Pittsburgh, ' said that the government
can only achieve somuch, and that it
was up to individuals to make a differ-
ence. '

“We can not mandate compas-'

sion,” he said. “We cannot legislate
understanding.”

Wadhwani ‘and host Anju Chopra
urged the Indian community to volun-

' teer their time and energy to help those
in need. Wadhwani presented Roddey
with a list of volunteers who had

pledged their help should the county
evervencounter a disaster, and passed
out forms for audience members to

prevent prejudice

add their names to the list. Wadhwani.
- also presented a" check for $30,000 to
United Way‘ of Allegheny County,

Executive Director Bill Meyer for the
United Way’s Sept. 11 fund.

Chopra said that the Indian-
American community, which numbers

more than 8,000 in Pittsburgh, “stands -

shoulder to shoulder with the United
States community in the battle against
terrorism.” "She also praised the
national Indian-American community,-
which she said is one of the "fastest-

growing immigrant communities and _ s

also one of the most successful.

When hearing that there were 1.7
million Indian-Americans in the coun-
try, roughly the equivalent of the pop-
ulation of Nebraska, Roddey said
“maybe we should swap Nebraska for
another 1.7 million.”

Council should passliving wage

Today the Allegheny County Council
can make progress by voting to implement
a living wage — $9.12 per hour with bene-
ﬁts and $10.62 per hour without — for
employees of the county, its contractors
and businesses that receive Allegheny
County economic development assis-
tance.

The bill garnered its share of contro-
versy during the last several months. Both
sides of the struggle showered the Council
with statistics supporting their respective
positions. But as the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported yesterday, little is proven
about its effect either way.

Allegheny County should try it from a
standpoint of fairness, if nothing else.

Imagine that you work 40 hours per
week, 51 weeks per year at the current
minimum wage of $5.15 per hour. Based
on our calculations, you would earn
$10,506 in a year — before deductions for
taxes, Social Security and Medicare.

It’s hard to survive on $10, 506 a year
as a single person. According to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services (www.hhs.gov), the poverty line
for a single person household is $8,590.

It’s even harder if you have a family.
Health and Human Services calculate the
poverty line for a family of four at
$17,650.

Imagine having to work all year and
still being unable to make ends meet.
Based on 2000 Census data, which can be

found at www.census. gov, that’s how 12.5
percent of the population in this developed
country lives.

That’s how the living wage can help.
It varies for different areas of the country
depending on the cost of living. It is cal-
culated based on the amount of hourly
income it takes to support a family of four
at or above the poverty line for that area,
according to the Living Wage Campaign.

Opponents of this idea charge it will
cause inﬂation, force governments to raise
taxes and hurt the economy. But the dol-
lar’s strength rests on the strength of the
global economy. Its value would likely not
be affected. _

As those against President George W.
Bush’s tax cut plan noted, those at the bot-
tom of the economic scale tend to spend
more. Our economy is based on consump-
tion. So it stands to reason that putting
more money into the hands of those more
likely to spend it will boost the economy.

One can also argue that a living wage
will increase the quality of services ren-
dered, because it could cause more com-
petition for jobs and thus give workers
more incentive to perform to their best
capability. . V

Today, the Allegheny County Council
can take a stand against poverty. While no
one knows how it will work out, it is well
worth the uy. Doing something to combat
recession and poverty, as the New Deal
showed us, is betterthan nothing at all.

  Focus: Reparations for slavery

Reparations fair, needed    

On the issue of reparations I agree with
the National Coalition Of Blacks for
Reparations in America (NCOBRA), the
organization that for the past two decades
has been the leading voice for reparations.

I believe that black people should be
compensated for the unjust, brutal and inhu-
mane practice of slavery and the racial dis-

Blacks ‘— and Racist Too” advertisement, he
basically publicizes shared sentiments across

America about reparations. -

We are well, aware that there were
Africans who practiced slavery, sold
Africans into slavery and even that: there
were black slaveholders in America.

But all that is light-years from the point.

crirnination and oppression
imposed upon our people since.

Reparations are not only a
moral imperative for America,
but it should also be a legal
mandate.

The issue is not vengeance
or making whites “pay” for the
atrocity called slavery. Instead,
this is an issue of political and
economic warrant.

 

Brentin Mock
Columnist

Yes, Africans held a slave
class just like the Romans and
Greeks. But the slave class
that existed in Africa, as in
Europe, was nowhere near_ as
atrocious, dehumanizing or
rapacious as the one that exist-
ed on American soil.
Affirmative action and
welfare beneﬁts don’t even
scratch the surface when com-

Whites don’t owe blacks.

The U.S. govemment and its robust econo- ,

my is responsible for compensating descen-
dants of slaves for over 400 years of arduous
labor, rape, torture, lynchings and discrimi-
nation thrust upon blacks without so much
as an apology.

No one —— white, black or otherwise —
could have participated in the barbaric act of
slaveholding without the protection of the
U.S. government. I

Whites are almost unison, though, in
their opposition to it. Hell, there are black
people who are against it

Arguments, almost outdated at this
point, revolve mainly around the time and
space of the claim. They feel we are so many
years removed from theseracial crimes that
arguments for reparations are obsolete.

They’re right only if you assume that
the call for reparations is recent. In fact,
blacks have called for reparations since their
emancipation from slavery.

It’s well-known that the U.S. govern-
ment decided to award blacks 40 acres of
U.S. land and a mule for their “inconve-
nience,” but as the famous tale goes, we
never received it. Blacks could not take their
case to court because legally we were not
considered citizens.

Because we were not able to represent
ourselves in court under laws ﬂrat voided our
citizenship, statutes of limitation cannot be
enforced in the argument against reparations.

Further, our court system provides the
cy pres doctrine that, in both trust and com-
mercial law, grants the power to determine
alternative beneﬁciaries if named trust bene-
ﬁciaries are absent.

Bear in mind that the slave trade affect-
ed not only blacks in the United States but
also those of South America, Africa and
parts of Europe. Irnrrrigrant or not, I would
bet a majority of blacks can be traced back to
s1avery’s estimated 25 million victims.

In David Horowitz’s now infamous and
vornit-inducing “Ten Reasons Why
Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for

, pared with reparations
because neither are race-speciﬁc and, con-
trary to popular belief, blacks are not the
chief beneﬁciaries of either provision.

Arguing that America doesn’t have the

ftmds to foot the bill doesn’t-hold much
weight either in light of the fact that the fed-
era1_govemment annually pumps billions of
dollars into ﬂourishing companies, like
Microsoft, through a. {whispered scheme
Time magazine calls “corporate welfare.”

If it were any other people, reparations
would not be an issue. Reparations have
been awarded to Jews, .lapanese—Americans
(Nisei), Hawaiian natives, Ute Indians and
almost all of Western Europe after World
War II. The list goes on.

As Mari Matsuda states in the book
“Critical Race Theory,” “The grant of repa-
rations declares: ‘You exist. Your experience
of deprivation is real. You are entitled‘ to
compensation for .that deprivation. This
nation and its laws acknowledge you.”’

Why are black people constantly denied
their self-worth? Why do we feel that the
white citizens of this country do not respect
our grievances and losses?

‘ We all openly abhor the Atlantic slave
trade, the institution of slavery and Jim
Crow. We leave the Andy Warhol Museum
gagging from the “VV1thout Sanctuary”
lynching exhibit. We can read from numer-
ous sources about continued housing and job
discrimination against blacks.

What else do we need to legitimize

blacks’ claim for reparations?

Is the issue protecting pocketbooks or
saving face? Are we truly not respected by

-the majority race of this country?

- I really want to believe that the afﬁnn-
ing answers to these questions are not the
reality. But when I come across those who
scoff at the idea of reparations for blacks ...

q, I can’t help but wonder.

Columnist Brentin Mock will be donating his
share of reparation money to charity since
The Pitt News pays him so well.

the effects of slavery. But I _ '

.won’t.

Questions plague reparations issue

Should the govemment pay repara-
tions for slavery? The answer doesn’t mat-
ter as much as the questions it raises. Why
should they, or should they not, be given?
Who should receive them? How will they
be ftmded? What will be cut as a result?
What are the intangible side effects? '

The ﬁrst of those questions exists out-

need. If so, would only lower class people
be eligible for the beneﬁts, since one of the
arguments for reparations is that blacks
have been kept economically suppressed?
Would middle ‘and upper class blacks be
excluded? Would the black eyes reading
this newspaper be denied beneﬁts since
they are privileged enough to be attending

side the scope of this column
since it contains enough argu-
ments and counterargurnents
to ﬁll a book. _ ‘

For example, I could
argue that, unlike Holocaust
survivors and Japanese-
Americans forced into intem-

 

amajor university? ‘

The debate moves into
the_most heated arena when
the question of reparations
becomes, “How will they be
fimded and what will be cut?”

irnproving education. While _a more feasi-

e ble idea than giving reparations to individ-

uals, this creates a whole different set C of
problematic issues. Would the groups work
primarily in the South or inner cities,. where
black people are more likely to be descen-
dants of slaves? If so, what about people in

suburban, and rural areas?

Once set up, would programs devised
to help descendants of slaves be created
exclusively for their use? If Latinos living
in the same inner cities were to try to utilize
the programs, would they be told, “Sorry,
we don’t allow your kind here”?

Perhaps the programs would be set up
so that beneﬁts are dispersed on basis of

which are to address an injus-
tice committed by people who
are long since dead to people who are long
since dead, must compete with a host of
other - more immediate, contemporary
issues. ’

Do you cut Medicare payments for the —

elderly so that reparations can be made?
Would blacks, who among certain seg-
ments_of the population are now the high-
est group at risk for HIV contraction, be
better served by reparations than by AIDS
research?

Homeland security. Education. Social
security. Which problem that affects the liv-
ing" do you shortchange for the sake of the
justice for the dead?

The most interesting question repara-
tions raise is, what are the intangible side
effects? Paying reparations will likely
cause new and “bitter resentment among

. whites, Latinos, Asians‘ and all the other
groups that would be taxed for the sake of

an enonnous expenditure of which they

would receive no beneﬁt.

Politicians have viciously long memo-
ries, and the liberals and moderates that
previously supportedafﬁrrnative action and

_inner city education programs may be I

swayed both by their own beliefs and that
of their constituents to pass over other more
relevant black interests. No decision is

V made in a vacuum, especially when such

tremendous amounts of money are
involved.

The ‘argument for reparations is one
that gets shakier with every question asked
and every issue raised. Slavery was no
doubt a terrible wrong, a time when
America proved that it too could be one of
the dark places of the world. But the ques-
tion of whether the memory of the .dead
should‘ be considered before the needs of

the living_ is a one that no one has a right to ’

answer in the affirmative.

Sponrs Vuzw

Kenneth Paul

I don’t feel pity for too many
people but if you’ve got a‘ heart, you
kind of have to feel for the now for-
mer Notre Dame coach, Bob Davie.

As I watched the Notre Dame-
Purdue game on Saturday, it was
impossible to pay attention to the
game, because ABC’s announcing
team would not stop talking about
the‘ fact that Davie was about to be
fired.

Everybody in the nation knew
that it was going to happen,yet the
commentators and every other col-
lege football know-it-all talked them-
selves breathless discussing Davie’s
axeing. ~ 4

It was as.if when the final whistle
blew, Davie was going to have to run
out of the stadium dodging bullets —
a fugitive on the run. And as great

and storied as Notre Dame’s winning

tradition is, I can think of a few other
events out there that are more crucial
than a football coachgetting. fired.

I don’t know if any of you have
heard about it but I think there’s a
war going on. As a matter of fact, I’m
pretty sure of it. —

Yes, the school’s recruiting did
not prosper with Davie at the helm
and the team struggled to a 5-6
record this season. I realize that his
record was not acceptable for a Notre
Dame coach but neither was the
media’s or Notre Dame’s handling of
the situation. Let’s not forget that he
won nine games just a year ago.

Notre Dame athletic director
Kevin White did not enlighten any-
one about the situation in the days

Pitt gets split in Arizona

MATT MILOSZEWSKI
Staff Writer

The Panthers women’s basketball team split two games
while playing in the Arizona Basketball Classic last week-
end.

On Friday the Panthers took on No. 20 Vﬁsconsin in the
first round of the tournament. The bigger, stronger, more
experienced Badgers out—rebounded (37-30) and outplayed
the Panthers to an easy 92-75 victory. The Badgers had an
18-11 rebounding edge in the first half and used their front-
court size to attain an early 11-0 lead that they never relin-
quished.

Tamara Moore led the Badgers with 21 points and eight
assists, while helping the Badgers, now 4-1 overall advance
to an Arizona Basketball Classic championship matchup
with Holy Cross.

Brooke Stewart led the Panthers in the loss, scoring a
team-high 16 points. Three other Panthers joined Stewart in
double’ ﬁgures as Mandy VV1ttenmyer netted 11 points and
Jackie Campbell and Sheila Stufﬂet each put up 10. The loss
sent the Panthers into a consolation game with tournament
host Arizona. '

The entire weekend served as a homecoming for
Panthers-’ head coach Traci Waites. Before taking the job in
1999, Waites was the assistant head coach at Arizona from
1994-1998. ‘In her return, Waites did her job to spoil the
occasion for the host Arizona Wildcats. '

On Saturday, the Panthers upset Arizona 81-80.

The Panthers came out strong, dominating the entire
first half and began to do the same early in the second. With

Joe Lydic played third base for the
Panthers before he was drafted by Houston.

 

CHRIS PAPST
Staff Writer

Former Pitt baseball standout Joe
Lydic is not only living his dream, but
he is al-so living the dream of millions
of boys throughout this country. The
Houston Astros drafted Lydic in the
seventh round of the 2000 amateur
major league baseball draft. .

After graduating from Bethel Park
High School in 1998, 6—foot-4-inch,
215-pound Lydic never envisioned

playing third base for Pitt. The team

did not recruit Lydic, even though he
was just 30 minutes away. He decided
to sign with Miami University of
Ohio, where he spent only his fresh-
man year, before transferring to Pitt,

whose new coaching staff finally
recruited him. Lydic wasn’t sure if he
would like his new home.

“At first I did not think I would
like the city,” Lydic said, “but
Pittsburgh is a fun place with a lot to
do. ‘I was also very happy with the
school and the baseball program.”

Lydic knows that playing baseball
for Pitt’s head coach Joe Jordano was
a good experience that taught him a
lot.

“I liked playing for Jordano after
coming from Miami,” Lydic said.
“The coach there always yelled and
embarrassed you when you made a
mistake, J ordano kept the atmosphere

CONNOR FLAHERTY
The Pitt News

The No. 19—ranked Panthers
wrestling team came away from the Cliff
Keen Las Vegas Invitational last week-‘
end with a sixth place ﬁnish in one of the
top intercollegiate tournaments in the
nation.

Five Panthers in-particular placed in

their weight classes, with Blaise Mucci
(141 lbs.) and ‘Dan Stine (184 lbs.)
advancing to the ﬁnals of their respec-
tive classes.

Mucci made headway ' through the
competition, chalking up ﬁve victories,
including at forfeit victory over third-
ranked David Douglas of Arizona State.
Mucci’s run ended’ with a ﬁnals loss
against No. 8-ranked Cedric Haymon of
Cal Poly.

Dan Stine’s path tothe ﬁnal seemed
somewhat more daunting as he. would
have to score victories over No. I2
Jeremy VV1lson of Portland State and N o.
10 Rob Rohn of Lehigh. Accomplishing
both, Stine’s run ended with a 4-1 ﬁnals
loss against No. 4—ranked Andrew
Hrovat of Michigan.

Several other {Panthers prevailed
with strong showings, including redshirt
freshman Mike May, who posted a 5-2
record, on his way to earning a fourth
place ﬁnish in the g125—pound Weight

May won three consecutive matches
including‘ a 5-1 victory over Mario
Stuart of perennial powerhouse Lehigh,
before dropping a match in the semiﬁ-
nals to the " nation’s No. l-ranked
wrestler "in Stephan Abas of - Fresno
State. ’

Carl’ Fronhofer at 165 pounds and
David Sandberg at 197 pounds alsogput
forth place winning efforts as Fronhofer

produced a 5-2 record for the weekend, 0

only to lose in the quarterﬁnals, putting
him at seventh for_his respective weight
class. 

Sandberg came out blazing to win

his ﬁrst three matches, including a 5-3

victory over the No. 5—ranked wrestler in
the nation, Justin Ruiz of Nebraska.
Sandberg lost to No. 3 Jon Trenge of
Lehigh and No. 7 David Shunafnon of

, Edinboro to ﬁnish in sixth place.

Other Panthers contributing to an
overall successful effort were Shawn
Amistade and Jacob Lininger, who com-
bined for _a.7-4 record, which included
onemajor decision and three pinfalls. ;

, Justin Giovinco, out previously with
a shoulder injury, came back strong to
ﬁnish above .500 with a,3—2 record at
149 pounds. ~

The Panthers, who are 1-1 on the
season, will travel to Bloomsburg on
Dec. 6 for adual meet at 7:30 pm. _

Gildon and Holmes need to remain Steelers

It’s the first week of December. It’s
supposed to start snowing soon. VV1th that
in mind, let’s talk football.

- The Steelers are off to their best start
since 1983, mainly because their defense is
No. 1 in the NFL.

The reason their defense is No. 1 is
because they have the best‘ group of line-

« backers in the NFL.

Jason Gildon is well on his way to
another Pro Bowl and Earl Holmes will
likely follow 

But that game could very much be

p their last as members of the Steelers. Both
players will be free agents after this season, *

and if the past tells us anything, both could
be playing in different uniforms next sea-
son.

A defense without Gildon and Holmes
sounds much like a defense without Greg
Lloyd and Rod Woodson sounded six
years ago.

Not only would it be beneﬁcial for the
Steelers to re-sign both, it would be a good
idea for both to come back to Pittsburgh.

Gildon has become an excellent pass

rusher as an outside linebacker in a 3-4
defense. In a 4-3 defense, which every
team except the Steelers plays, he would
be required to drop into coverage more
often, rather than rush the passer.

The only way Gildon could continue

Jerry Jones recently said he would not ﬁre
coach Dave Campo after this season,
despite Dallas’ abysmal performance on
the ﬁeld. Jones admitted that two years was
not enough time for Campo to be success-
ful.

his success in a 4-3 defense
would be moving to defensive
end, a position that he is too
small to play on'every down.

Meanwhile, Holmes .
might have a better chance to
succeed in the 4-3, but much
of his success comes from the
play of the inside linebacker
next to him in the 3-4.

If the Steelers have to
choose between the two,
Holmes would be the better
choice. ' S

 

Sports Vlsw

Joe Marchilena

What about CaInpo’s
predecessor, Chan Gailey? In
the two years that Gailey was
coach, the Cowboys were 18-
14, made the playoffs both
years and even won a divi-
sion title. His era was easily
more successful than
Campo’s. '

0 Randy Moss should do
the right thing and return his
entire paycheck for this sea-
son.

Not only would he com-
mand less money than Gildon, but the
Steelers have more options at outside line-
backer, where they could stick Mike Jones
or even move Kendrell Bell.

0 Cowboys owner/general manager

that he takes some plays off, proving what
most of us already knew.

Unfortunately, Moss is right about the
Vikings never winning a Super Bowl, but
not because they aren’t talented enough,
but because quitters never win.

Moss recently admitted

0 What is the matter with Teny Glenn?

The Patriots’ wide receiver was sus-
pended again and sent to his room with no
team dirmer, this time for not saying “Hi”
to owner Bob Kraft when the two passed
each other in the hall.

Glenn is arguably the most talented
athlete in the NFL, yet he has failed to live
up to the expectations he set after his rook-
ie season. That year, the man who Bill
Parcells once referred to as “she,T’ set a
record with 90 receptions and helped the
Patiiots reach the Super Bowl.

Since then, Glenn has become a for-
gotten man and wants out of New England
just as much as the Patriots want him out.
Many teammates have even gone as far as
to call him a cancer.

What team would willingly infect ‘

themselves with Glenn-itis?

Joe Marchilena is a columnist for The Pitt

— News and is hoping that Terry Glennis oﬁ’—

ﬁeld problems will give him an opportuni-
ty to try out for the Patriots during the
break.

Former Pitt player working towards dream in minors

Lydic, page 11

here more professional , and that
enabled me learn the game better.”

Lydic attributes most of his suc-
cess to his parents and his best friend
Marty Rini’s competitive spirit. Rini
plays baseball for Marshall University
and hopes to join his friend in the
minor leagues this year.

“My parents were hard workers
and they instilled that in me,” Lydic
said. “My dad and I worked together
so much that he cannot even throw a
baseball now. And when my dad was
busy, Marty and I would play and
always push each other. If he did 50
push-ups I would do 55, if he ran a
mile I would run it faster. That com-
petitiveness got both of us a long
way.” I

While most people on draft day
have parties, and invite’ friends and
family members to await the phone
call, Lydic decided to take a more
relaxed approach. _

“I was home by myself because

- my parents were at work,” Lydic said

with a slight laugh. “I was instant
messaging my friend from school and
he was watching the ESPN News Web
site that was covering the draft. Out of

nowhere he said to -me, ‘Joe you just

_ got drafted.’ I didn’t believe him. and

then just like one or two minutes later
I got a call saying, ‘Hi, Joe this is
Mike Maggert from the Houston
Astros. We just selected you in the
seventh round.’ It was the ‘happiest
moment of my life.”

“For the next few days, people’

that I have not talked to in years were
calling me and congratulating me,” he

said. “Little league coaches, distant

family members, they were all calling
me. Fox‘ Sports even came to my
house to interview me. It was a pretty
exciting couple of days.”

But things got hard quickly; going
into the minors for the ﬁrsttime was
not an easy adjustment for him.

“When I ﬁrst got to the club house
I was the ﬁrst American there,” he
said. “There was about 15 Latin
American players looking at me and
rambling something off in Spanish.
All I could say to myself was, ‘what
did I get myself into?”’

The atmosphere was not the only‘

adjustment he had to make because
the differences between the college
game and the professional game were
huge.

“The pitching was the toughest

adjustment. Every pitcher you see was
the best pitchers during their college
careers,_” he said; “Plus, everyone runs
a little bit faster, hits a little bit better
and throws a little bit harder. ‘It’s a dif-
ferent game from college.”

The ‘life of a professional baseball
player is not the life everyone thinks it
is according to Lydic. The average day
begins at 9 a.m.,with a small breakfast
and from there the players have to
report to the weight roomby 10.

After lifting for an hour, the play-
ers are expected to eat and be at‘ the

field and ready by 2 p.m. From 2 to 5

3:30 p.m. the entire team practices the
fundamentals of the game and from 4
to 5 p.m.the team takes batting prac-

tice and then ' retires to‘ the locker ‘

room, where they will have peanut
butter sandwiches and fruifwaiting for
them. I , ,

The schedule includes no breaks
as .they are back on the field taking
inﬁeld-outﬁeld practice in their game
uniforms at 6 p.m. _ .

The games usually begin at 7 p.m.
and end around 10:30 p.m. After eat-
ing and showering, the players can
expect to be in bed by midnight, then

wake up a few hours later and do it all

over again. On average, the team may

have one day off a month. The players’

are always expected to play their best,
according to Lydic.

“The game is very cut-throat,”
Lydic said. “If you don’t produce you
are gone. Its not like college where
you can have a few bad games and
still’ play, if you are in a slump you
will get cut. It’s not uncommon to see
a 30-year-old man leave the locker
room bawling his eyes out and the
worse part is that the coaches don’t
care at all.

“The major leagues is not the
game we played as kids,” Lydic said,
“it’s a business. They are in it to make
money. They don’t care about you.”

Lydic’s goal is to.be in the major
leagues‘ by the tirne:hevis 25 years of
age.
“I can do it,” he said. "‘There is a
lot of luck involved, but if I stay
healthy and stay focused, I can makeit
to the show.” . . , ’

Lydic played this past year with
the single-A Michigan Battlecats
where he broke a rib running overna
catcher, putting him on the disabled
list for the majority of the season. He
will to return to the field in March to
pursue his ultimate goal of making it
to the major leagues.

Davie debacle handled poorly by media and Irish -

Davie, page 11

preceding the firing. Neither the players or
Davie, nor the fans nor the media. 

' So under arguably the hottest spotlight in
sports, Davie was tied to the stake, while the fir-
ing squad darted questions toward a man that had
no knowledge and was just trying to keep his
team and staff focused.

And now, just one year removed from hand-
ing Davie a new five-year contract, White and his
employer must eat the length of the contract.
Poor Bob Davie, right? I don’t think so.

While Davie is relaxing and waiting for his
paychecks that will be signed by White for the

next four years, he can entertain offers from other a

schools. At the same time, his former employer is
scurrying for a replacement.

And even with all of the fame and tradition,
it’s not going to be easy to land a new coach and

not disrupt recruiting.‘-

The first thing a high school recruit needs to .

see before signing with a school is stability.
Nobody wants a coach to abandon them after a
year or two. Recruits need to feel ’a sense of trust
between themselves, the coaching staff and the
school. Notre Dame has no coaching staff as of
today. It’s called being in limbo. Recruiting takes
place 365 days a year and Notre Dame currently
is unable to hit the trail’.

The rumor mill brings up the-names of V
.Oklahoma’s Bob Stoops, and the NFL’s Tom

Coughlin, Steve Mariucci and Jon Gruden as pos-
sible replacements.

Stoops just». signed a big contract with
Oklahoma and I don’t see the Sooners even let-
ting the Irish get close to their man. Coughlin
could possibly be an option since his Jacksonville
club is struggling but Gruden’s Raiders and
Mariucci’s 49ers are going to still be playing

football well into January.
With Gruden and Mariucci leading teams into

the playoffs and in Gruden’s case, probably deep

into them, .that will leave too large of a gap in
recruiting. Plus, both coaches currently have job
security, a rarity in the NFL. ..

-Notre Dame is not the school that it once was.

Trust me Iiwas there for the Pitt game and once ,
you go five miles outside of campus, your top I

option for Friday night entertainment is to see
who can punt the possum the farthest through the
Confederate ﬂag. Not fun.

Notre Dame is a school that prides itself on
winning but as of late, it appears that they pride
themselves on running coaches out of town. Just
ask Lou Holtz. . '

Kenneth Paul is the sports editor for The Pitt :

News and in his first and only attempt, shanked
the possum wide-left.

Waites gets win over former team Cg1~;~e¢;§gn;

Arizona, page 11

about 14 minutes to play, Arizona guard Julie Brase was
injured and was taken off the court on a stretcher with a back
injury.

With the Panthers leading 56-42, it appeared that the 10-
minute delay killed the Panthers’ momentum as Arizona
banded together following the injury timeout and played
inspired basketball.

The Wildcats went on a 30-15 run and took a 72-71 lead
with just under four minutes to play. However, the Panthers
responded to the Wildcat run with a 10-0 run of their own
and did not look back, completing their comeback victory
81-80. .

Bolstered by her five three—pointers, Stewart’s 23 points
led the Panthers. Stewart’s scoring not only helped her team
win, it also helped her win all—tournament team honors,
behind he average of 19.5 points per game.

Also in double figures for the game was Laine Selwyn
with 21 points and Bettina Love and freshman Haley
Harguth with 12 each. Harguth’s scoring came via four
three—pointers.

The Wildcats, now 3-3 overall, were led in scoring by
