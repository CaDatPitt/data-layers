Gala mimics Cathedral country club

The Black Action Society’s In-

daba inspired Cousin Jeff John?

son, Black Entertainment Tele-
vision regular and Pitt alumnus,
to take Africana studies courses
and becomemore involved in
the black community. ,
“That event alone inﬂuenced

jmy path for the rest of my Pitt

career,” said Pitt junior Jahmaiah
Lewis.

johnsonwas the guest speak-
er at the Indaba, which means
“meeting” in Zulu, last Satur-
day in the \William Pitt Union
Assembly Room. Former CNN
news anchor and keynote speak-
er Jacque Reid also spoke at the
event regarding issues affecting

black people‘with respect to the
media.

“Indaba is just a gathering of
people to promote awareness
about the BAS on campus. A lot
of freshmen come to the event
and are introduced to the BAS
members at Pitt,” said Lewis.

Kicking off its 2008-09 term,
BAS welcomed students and

V faculty to a new executive board

and a new year of promising
leadership. .

The new BA_S_ president,
Lesley Adewunmi, revealed this
year’s BAS theme: A United Peo-
ple is the Catalyst for Change.

In her inaugural address, Ad-

ewunmi. challenged students to
be active members of the Pitt
community. A

Diveraily reporter

Director of the Office of
Cross-Cultural and Leadership
Development, ‘Linda Williams-
Moore, came out to show her
support after helping the soci-

ety’s leaders to coordinate the

event.

“It’s a good opportunity for
the campus" to get together,” she
said. “The event isn’t just about
BAS, it’s about bringing together

the entire Pitt campus.”

Also in attendance was Dean A

of Students Kathy Humphrey,
who said she appreciates the op-
portunities that Indaba offers.
“BAS hosts Indaba each year
to pull its community. together

‘and allow students to listen to
words of motivation and wis—-

dom,” said Humphrey.

It was a swanky Sunday on the
Cathedral Lawn where students
donning pearls and argyle partook
in a variety of country club games
while at the Gala at the Cathedral
Lawn.

This first-time event, hosted by
the Pi Kappa Alpha and Phi Delta
Theta fraterriities, raised funds for
the Universityof Pittsburgh Can-
cer Institute. I

Spread across the area desig-

nated as the east lawn were games
of bocce, badminton and croquet.
Teams played several rounds,
eventually advancing to the ﬁnals.
In all, more than 70 teams signed
up beforehand, whose registration

fees went directly to the Cancer

Institute.

On the first bocce court, a team
of four girls took turns bowling
their bocce balls closest to the jack,

Onorato appeals drink

tax referendum ruling

by‘Keith Gillogly I
Staﬂ Wrder

The future of the drink, tax
remains murky as another appeal
has been put on the table.

County Council launched a ref-
erendum for the November ballot
"earlier this summer that asked if

voters would prefer raised proper- i

ty taxes in exchange for a repeal of
the drink tax. The County Board
of . Elections denied the question
previously this month, but Allegh-
eny County Executive Dan On-
orato recently made an appeal for
the question. I

_County Council is not respon-

V sible for the appeal, said district
seven County Council member.
Nicholas Futules. Rather. Onorato’

made the appeal in the Common

Pleas Court last Tuesday on his
own accord. ,

Futules believes Onorato acted
independently because the major-
ity of County Council members
likely would nothave supported
the appeal. Furthermore, Futules
thinks Onorato chose to appeal as
a safeguard, in case FACT’s appeal
passes. , S I

“In my opinion [Onorato is
appealing] just because 
appealed,” said Futules.

'-The Friends Against Coun-
terproductive Taxation group ap-

A pealed a ruling made by the Coun-

ty Board of Elections beforehand
this month. Composed of a group
of Allegheny County restaurant
owners opposed to the drink tax,
FACT’s appeal is pushing for a

Port Authority strike

could occur any Week  

by Jessel August Costa III
Staff WrL'[er

Nearly one week after the release of an 
mediation proposal by a fact—ﬁnder, the Port Au-
thority of Allegheny County and Amalgamated
Transit Union Local 85 have made their respec-
tive decisions 0

The authoiity’s board voted unanimously this
Friday to approve fact—ﬁnder]at1e Riglefs recom-
mendations, which included a 3—percent annual
wage increase for employees and the condition
that said employees pay a larger percentage to-
ward their health and pension benefits

Only hours after the Port Authoiity’s board
voted to accept the proposals, the Union rejected

V the proposal, voiding the ﬁct-f1nder’s recommen-

dations — in the fact—ﬁnding stage, recommen-
dations must be accepted by both sides, en masse,
in order to become  T

The next step in negotiations is unclear,
though it could come as soon as Monday. The
authority and the union are next slated to con-
tinue negotiations, possibly in front of state and
federal mediators. The possibility of a labor stop-

is not made

A labor stoppage would affect some 220,000
daily riders,  of whom are entirely depen-
dent on various forms of public transportationto
get to school or work

In order to lessen the impact a stiike may have
on Pitt students, the University has issued a'state—
ment outlining ways that  affected com-
muters canget to campus in the event of strike

“Campus bus service may be expanded in
an effort to provide transportation to students,
faculty and staff  [it] may extend two to three
miles in radius and include areas such as Shady-
side and Squirrel Hill  The University is 
to provide service to neighborhoods outside of
the city with a possibility of creating a series of
neighborhood gathering points where University
passengers can board a Pitt bus to campus,” said a
statement ﬁromthe University.

Furthermore, the University suggests that
students take advantage of expanded  or
pa1k—and—ride services,  with friends or
family, or, weather  students can ride a
bicycle to campus, because the-campus bike racks
can accommodate more than 500 bicycles

he is assured County Council’s

“I am confident that their ques-_

he said. Graf added that County

they will not actually raise prop-

‘"‘['-The County Council’s ref-

While both outcomes of

both appeals are unnecessary at
this point.

“I believe both of these [refer-

Futules. “FACT was complain-

lndaba helps
promote BAS

and change

Diversity, page 1

Eager freshmen and older students
waited to see what the new BAS board
would bring.

Opening this year’s ceremony, BAS Ac-
ademic Affairs Vice—Chair Arielle Spivey
led the crowd in singing a rendition of
“The Black National Anthem.”

Then, former BAS leaders Larry Miller
and Sheila Isong delivered speeches.

Isong, last year’s BAS president, told the
history of the BAS’s formation in 1968.

The main goal of the BAS back then
was to achieve black freedom, both physi-
cally and mentally.

“The Indaba observance began as an
informal rap session that allowed mem-
bers and those interested in the organiza-
tion to express themselves in a communal
environment,” said Isong in her speech.

Pitt senior Marcus Simpson came to
Indaba for that very reason.

“I always like to go to events where
there are a lot of individuals that I can re-
late to and talk about issues that are affect-
ing us,” said Simpson.

Equality and freedom are still crucial
elements of our society, the tone of the
event would later reﬂect.

The Assembly Room shook not only
with symbolism as campus organizations
Anointed Steps of Faith, Some of Gods
Children Gospel Choir and the Black
Dance W/orkshop gave rousing perfor-
mances.

A presentation of the various BAS
steering committees was one of the main
highlights of lndaba. Every chairperson
spoke and gave details about meeting
times and what positions entail.

One of the pillars of this term’s BAS
executive board is promoting positive
change both on campus and in the world.

Adewunrni encouraged all students to
get the most out of their education and to
strive for greatness in all aspects of life.

“These four years will become the most
deﬁning time of your life,” said Adewun-
mi.

FACT: Petitions ﬁltered this summer

Drink tax, page 6

Composed mainly of lawyers, realtors and
business leaders, the group ﬁled the chal-
lenge against FACT in court last Tuesday.

FACT spent the summer collecting sig-
natures of Allegheny County citizens and
turned in a stack of about 45,000 signed
petitions to the County Board of Elections
last August. Though 45,000 were handed in,
the president of Citizens Against Raising
Property Taxes, Shawn Flaherty, said that
only 16,794 are actually valid.

be a registered voter in Allegheny County,
living and residing in Allegheny County at
the time he signed the petition, Flaherty
said.

Flaherty explained the steps of filling
out one of .the petitions.

“It’s not rocket science. Print your name,
print your address, apply your signature, and
put the date on it,” he said.

Members of Flaherty’s group went
through all 45,000 petitions line by line to
check their accuracy. Flaherty described the

task as “miserable.”

“\We painstakingly went through them
and matched every name with a voter ID
registration card,” Flaherty said.

In the process, CARTOP reported ﬁnd-
ing a plethora of errors. In addition to
coming across signatures from characters
such as “Steely McBeam” and “Henry Da-
vid Thoreau,” they found some petitions
incompletely or incorrectly filled out. Peti-
tions were found with blank sections and

Another problem stemmed from certain
signatures belonging to non-residents of
Allegheny County. Some signers were from
as far away as California and Canada, Fla-
herty said.

FACT did not intentionally collect such
“sloppily put together” petitions, Flaherty
said, but he believes the group did not put
effort into checking the signatures.

“The FACT individuals didn’t go through
them. They ﬁgured they would throw 44,000
signatures up there and that nobody would
take the time or the effort to see who all was
capable of signing them,” said Flaherty.

But Graf said FACT vetted the petitions
as they came in.

“We were looking at them to check their
validity as they came in, and based on those
counts we feel pretty confident that we have
more than enough signatures,” he said. “If
we came across a joke signature, we crossed
it out. We’re not going to turn something in
with a ‘Captain Crunch’ signature on it.”

Flaherty also reported that some circu-
lators of the petitions were not themselves
registered Voters living in Allegheny County.
If the name and address of the circulator
on the back of the petition did not check,
his collected signatures were invalidated.

Graf answered, however, that there were
possibly a few circulators who had only
recently registered to vote and that their
names were not yet in the system.

Soon after FACT turned the petition sig-
natures in, they were checked by the Allegh-
eny County’s Elections Division. Though
they certiﬁed approximately 40,000 signa-

tures, Flaherty said their review was cursory,

and by no means exhaustive.

If FACT does not have enough signa-
tures, it will be unable to advance its refer-
endurn.

“At the end of the day if there’s not
23,006 signatures on the petition, then we’re
not going to be able to move forward with
the referendum,” said Graf.

  EDITORIAL   ~
 College students smoked out
PASSHE bans smoking, but Pitt should wait

There are no 15-foot rules, no
20 percent compromises, no des-
ignated areas. For about 110,000
students and 12,000 employees
at all of Pennsylvania’s 14 state-
‘owned universities, smoking is
banned completely on school

property.

Higher Education, which owns
and operates the 14 state-owned
schools across Pennsylvania, as
an interpretation of the state-
wide smoking ban that went into
effect on Thursday. The state
ban extends to educational facili-
ties, and according to PASSHE,
campuses are considered edu-
, cational facilities “inside and
 out,” meaning students and staff
 can’t smoke anywhere on school
 property, inside or outside. '
The. move doesn’t affect Pitt,
1 or‘ the other state-related schools
j such as Penn State or Temple.
: However, an argument could
 be made that, given that Pitt ac-
’ cepted nearly 190' million dollars
’ from the state last year alone,

'9 there are_grounds for applying

it on_ our- campus as well. And
1 while Pitt’s stance on the issue
3 isn’t known at this time, there are
several additional factors to con-
I sider.
First and foremost, Pitt’s cam-
- pus is not so much a campus as a
loose collection of buildings and
1 lawns owned by the University
and scattered among public and
V private property. Public streets
 cut across the “campus” at al-
 most every turn, and storefronts
3 and private buildings share the
i sidewalk with University building
 entrances.
, Because of this, it would be
 nearly impossible to adequately
 ban smoking on Pitt’s campus

 because the campus is cut into.

 public property, where it would

so many nearby alternatives to

 Colum/zidt

that it would be effectively use- j

less, as being on campus at Pitt is
so difficult to differentiate from
being off campus.

Second, Pitt isn’t populated
solelyrby students and staff. Tens
of thousands of people walk,
bus or drive around and across

. Pitt’s grounds every day. Not

only would it be _nearly impos-
sible to get all of these people
to stop smoking on school prop-
erty, but it would also be grossly

unfair to people who need to tra- 5‘

Verse Oakland to get to their jobs 5

or homes.
In many ways, the question of

whether Pitt should enact the ban i
is a question of where to draw 
the line between a state-owned 3
school, a state-related school and;
a private school. Pitt, which -falls i
into the second category, is really- 1
just a blend of the other two —— 
we accept state money and fall 

. under some limited’ state juris-,1

diction, but for the most part we 
 polluted air, I’m a legitimate victim

operate as a private institution.

Other state laws, such-as the ‘
Right—to—Know law, don’t ap— ‘
ply to Pitt precisely because of 3
this odd relationship. Judging‘
solely by this precedent, it would ;
be hard for Pitt to implement 
the ‘ban based on legal stand— E
ing with the state, because the i
school could just as easily claim 
the same exemption that makes 3

it immune to other state laws.

Pitt, of course, could irnple- 
ment the ban on its own accord.»
And while the new law could, 
with some legal wrangling, be '

applied to Pitt and othefstate-re-

1 c

lated schools, the nature of Pitt’s l
campus and its relationship with §
the surrounding community and 
the rest of the state should un- 
equivocally dictate that the ban i

Ban not in line with liberty

   

On the coverage surrounding the
smoking ban, the lack of a coun-
ter viewpoint is, ironically, stifling I
want to make two  clear:

First, I know that’s not an ex-
ample of proper irony, except to the
extent that I knew it was stiﬂing and
the public was as yet unawares

Second, reasonable‘ people can
oppose the smoking ban. I do. -

the smoking ban’s sup-

. porters play off the correct public

perception that government regula-
tion is justiﬁed in the former cases,
by  a mental comparison
between smoking in privately owned
restaurants and polluting Earth’s air:
The ban is called the Clean Indoor
AirAct.It’slikeifwe calledthewar
in Iraq, “\World War H—B” and the
fiscal stimulus “The Newer Deal”
In this sense, the smoking ban prob-

fact shows how~proﬁt-seeking res-
taurants were already catering to the
majority preference that allegedly ne-

‘ cessitates the smoking ban, as well as

that choices for our tyrannical diners
are not much expanded by the ban.
Second, people want smokers
to quit smoking, so they want to
make a,smoke1’s life harder. Con-
sider the University policy that pro-
hibits smoking within 15 feet of an
entrance: I recognize secondhand
smoke is unhealthy, but I deny

The progressive consensus and  
' all news reporting, however, as-

sume as a matter offact that a
smoking ban is simply the kind 1
of  that civilized and rea-
sonable people support, like go-
ing to college, or not smoking
The smoking ban is sold
under the banner of protect- '
ing innocent bystanders from
secondhand smoke. In this
sense, it’s allegedly equivalent to 0

In reality, the smoking ban is not

People like the smoking ban for two .

reasons.

First, it universalizes a prefer-

‘ It’s as simple as someone  “I

ban on trans-fats: We’re culturally

Show puts Steelers’ fun it  

by Tony J ovenitti
Staﬂ Wrder

“The Chief”

Starring: Tom Atkins

Director: Ted Pappas

Pittsburgh Public Theater

O’Reilly Theater, Downtown‘
Tuesday, Sept. 16 - Sunday, Sept. 21
$15.50 Students, through Pitt Arts

What do the Steelers, boxing,

gambling, religion and family all"

have in common?

They all made up the life of
one of the most inﬂuential people
in Pittsburgh history: I\lFL Hall
of Farmer and Steelers founder
_Arthur  Rooney.

His life will be acted out by
Tom Atkins in the ' Pittsburgh
Public Theater’s sixth reprisal of
the one-man—show “The Chief.”

“The Chief” is the most suc-
cessful play in the 34-year history
of the PPT.Not only does it depict

Rooney’s founding of the Steelers,’

but it also provides some history
aboutthe city and its people. ,
“If you are new to Pittsburgh,
or you just moved here, there is
nothing like ‘The Chief’ to give

you a crash course in all that’s real-

ly fun about the city,” said produc- A

ing artistic director Ted Pappas.

_ And you don’tine'ed to be a
Steelers fan to enjoy the show, ac-
cording to Pappas.

I “I didn’t know very much
about the Steelers when I first
started working on the play,” said
Pappas.

Still, Steelers fans will certainly

‘enjoy reminiscing their team’s

beginnings. In fact, some of
Rooney’s original furniture adorns
theistage. L .

Pappas is from Manhattan,
where he worked on_ Broadway
and other projects before coming
to Pittsburgh. One of those other
projects was working as a chore-
ographer for Saturday Night Live
the early 1980s for comedians
such as Eddie Murphy and Julia
Louis Dreyfus. I

“It was really one of the most

I thrilling times of my career,” he

said. “Every Saturday night I get a
little nervous feeling in the pit of
my stomach like we’re about to go
on live.” i g —

Pappas said he always enjoys
working on one-actor plays be-
cause of ' the unique challenges
and advantages that it presents.

“[One—actor plays] are a really
unique and very friendly way of
telling a story because you speak
directly to the audience,” he said.
“It’s different because you estab-

A lish a relationship between the ac-

tor and the audience, rather than
between actors.”

“The Chief,” which was writ-
ten by Rob Zellers  Gene Col-
lier, debuted in‘_2003 and will soon

a be published in.book form by the

University of Pittsburgh Press.

i According to Pappas, the PPT
will produce many more exciting
plays later this year, several of
which he will be directing. They

, include a one—woman show, “The

Lady \With All The Answers,”
about the life of columnist 
Landers, and “Metamorphioses,’-’
which will be set entirely in water.
A pool will be built on the stage of
the O’Reilly Theater, which will be
city’s first "ever play in the water.

Students have a unique oppor-
tunity to purchase tickets to any or
all of these shows for $1 5.50. Pap-
pas calls this the “best deal in the
country” for students.

“We love our student audiences
here.” ‘

De Niro and Pacino fail M

to heat up the screen

by Noah Levinson
Staﬂ W/riter

Righteous Kill

Starring: Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Curtis
Jackson ‘

Directed by: Jon Avnet

Studio: Overture Films and Lions Gate
Entertainment

   

I hate to ask, but are Robert

  
   

57 ’
." -'  old to bebadass anymore?
ii’ ‘:55? It’s true that the films they
were in together were con-
sidered monumental. No one will ever forget
“Godfather II” or “Heat” -— theywill go down
in ﬁlm history as _ landmarks of badassery

Unfortunately, “Righteous Kill”is far from
a masterpiece. In fact, it’ll be lucky if it stays in
the theater longer than three weeks.

“Righteous I ' ” is an extremely disap-
pointing ciime drama with a weak twist; The
serial killer whom the cops (De Niro and Pa-
cino) are after is actually ridding the streets of
rapists anddope dealers who squeeze their way
out of court. ‘

So, the only  advertisers had going for
them when creating media hype were two big
Academy Award-winning names. When these
two star in the same movie, you’re guaranteed
box office gold, right? ' f

Too bad it isn’t that -easy anymore.

Even though De Niro was actually the
person who convinced Pacino to join “Righ-
teous,” neither actor has the stuff to pull off a
roll like this anymore. Yet, even if three more
big-name stars were put on the cast, this movie
would still come short

De Niro comes in front of Pacino, how-
ever, in that anger and aggression come “oh so

natural” to him + espe’cially in the hardcore

sex scene between De Niro and his fellow cop

who could be his daughter.
It sounds like something nasty sexual devi-

“~ ‘;~. De Niro, and Al,Pacino just too,

ants would Google — “Hardcore Robert De

‘Niro XEOC,” not something that draws crowds

to a theater.
Pacino, on the other hand, is  to be
something he isn’t: the eager partner who re-

, spects and follows his mentor (De Niro) like

Daniel Larusso emulating Mr. in “The

Karate Ki .” l ‘

The only performance that was serni—no-
ticeable was the character Spider portrayed by
Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent. Even

I though Jackson played a rough, down—to—busi—

ness, street thug boss, he really did a decent
job. Maybe he’s meant for acting, or maybe it
helped that Jackson was a rough street thug in
real life. 7 ' J

When  about experience, though, it

must be noted that “Righteous” was writer Rus-A

sell Gewirtz’s second screenplay. “Inside Man,”
the 2006 film starring Denzel \Washington and

Clive Owen, was Gewirtz’s breakthrough into

Hollywood and so far his only hit.

Additionally, director Jon Avnet debuted in
1991 and has had such “hits” as ‘The Mighty
Ducks,” “The Three Musketeers” and “George
of the Jungle.” If Avnetneeds to make a Dis-
ney family ﬂick, it’s an instant success, but his
most recent ﬁlm, “88 Minutes,” also starring Al
Pacino, ﬂopped beyond belief. , V

The last time De Niro and Pacino worked
together was in the Michael Mann thriller
“Heat” as good guy versus bad guy. Even
though they were the biggest stars in the mov-
ie, they appeared together for only one seven-
minute confrontation in a coffee shop.

This scene is emotionally charged because
De Niro and Pacino were emotionally charged
actors at the time. Now, it seems as if that pow-
er’ and feeling could not be elicited in “Righ—
teous Kill”

Maybe it was the inexperienced director

and writer combo or the ages of De Niro and A

Pacino, but “Righteous Kill” ends up dead on

The Avett Brothers '4 latest is
a short and sweet folk gem

by Larissa Gula
For Tbe Pitt New

The Gleam II

The Avett Brothers

Record Label: Ramseur Records

Rocks like: Iron and Wine, Whis-
' keytown '

 

“_  Indie roots. Folk-punk.
Nix Grunge—grass. Call it what
 you want, but The Avett

' Brothers mix rock and folk

like few others. .

The band’s acoustic origins lie in experi-

 
 

mental songs that Scott Avett played with‘

friends while the band Nemo was still togeth-
er. Seth Avett joined in the experimentations
brieﬂy before Nemo disbanded, and the two
brothers continuedwith their ideas.

During the last eight years the band has
released eight albums, with the newly released
EP hitting the shelves earlier this year. Tbs
Second Gleam is truly the middle child —— it’s
longer than a single but shorter than a full al-
bum, with only six acoustic songs occupying
a grand total of just over 20 minutes of play-
ing time. ‘ — p

The only other instruments in the group
‘are the occasional piano, drums and a banjo.

V A cello joins them in concert But this lack of

hard rock sound sh0uldn’t dissuade potential
listeners. In fact, the quiet, relaxing music is
perfect in that it Works with the lyrics rather
than distracts. _ i

The lyrics themselves are more advanced
than the average “emotions only?’ song -
the words are-quite poetic and even take on a
slight scripture feel as they ﬂow together. The
entire composition overall sounds a bit like
21 Simon and Garﬁinkel work with updated
instruments. I V _

The EP launches off with “Tear Down
The House,” an account of losing one’s
house. That almost sounds like one recent
situation in America, doesn’t it? Except our

 

houses weren’t scheduled for demolition. As

his house is considered for destruction, the

narrator remembers his childhood and all of
the memories he made within his old home’s
walls.

There’s a touch of civility with the stanza:
“Ever since I learned how to curse ,/ I’ve
been using those sorry old words / But, I’m
talkin’ to these children / And I’m keeping
it clean / I don’t need those words / To say
what I mean.” _ _

A handshake ought to be offered to the
Avett Brothers for reminding society that the
young don’t have to be brought up in a sea of

- low—quality language.

Tranquility and peace occurs two times
over because “Murder in the ’ is noth-
ing _more than a will and remembrance as
the singer says his feelings to those he would
leave behind if he were murdered. Not only
that, but the first two lines are a blatant plea
for revenge to stop and for people to live
peacefully even if one of the Avett Brothers
die. I ' .

And no hippie setting is complete without
a sense of loveto go with the peace. “Bella

Donna” is the love song all albums must _

contain somewhere on their track listing —
and this one has the singing Avett Brother
begging a young girl to listen to what one
man has to say. “The Greatest Sum” follows
“Bella Donna” in that it preaches to a loved
one about how nothing could hold the singer

‘ away from her. _
However, the setup and words used to de-

scribe the story in both songs is different than
the usual whiney boy in pop mainstream. It’s
much more mature, and this is what makes
the Avett Brothers’ music better than aver-
age.

Twenty minutes of listening are well spent
on this album. In an age when lyrics are more

often than not mindless repeats of simple V

human emotions, the depths that the Avett
Brothers explore is indeed ablessing,

the bread and cheese proved a fantastic be-

The wine selection, although impressive,
is a little bit pricey, so we opted to bring our
own and swallow the fl$15‘corking fee. As
the waitress poured, the merlot into long-
stemmed wine glasses, I tried a bit of aged
goat cheese on the olive bread.

The cheese was creamy and complement-
ed nicely by the olive tapenade. I don’t nor-

mally like bleu cheeses, but I ttied the bleu .

d’Auvergne simply because of its name. I
added a bit of grape and cheese to my palate
and surprisingly found myself enjoying the
explosion of taste in my mouth. The sweet
juice from the grape, blended with the bitter,
tart taste of the cheese, created a ﬁreworks
display around my mind similar to that in
“Ratatouille.”

As I listened to the music, I looked around
at the rich cardinal red walls, which lead up to
a cobalt blue ceiling dotted with white clouds.
It is a recreation of an outside patio, com-
plete with wine and cheese. This is a "slow
food" experience. Patrons enjoy every piece
of the meal while conversing and laugh-
ing. Ma Provence provides students with a
chance to get away from schoolwork, and go
on the world’s least expensive trip to France.
I was glad to be away from Pittsburgh for the
evening.

My date ordered the poisson du jour
($23), which was a red snapper served in a
red pepper reduction sauce beneath a zuc-
chini boat filled with carrot puree. The fish
was perfectly cooked —— every piece bursting
with ﬂavor. The wine, red pepper and butter
sauce was fantastic. Not too overpowering or
heavy, the sauce gave the fish its own needed
space, adding ﬂavorful spiced undertones.
The puree was incredibly simple: butter, salt
and other spices. We delighted in its straight-
forward elegance. It was beautifully arranged
in the zucchini boat, sails spread for its belly

I enjoyed Magret de canard aux Frarnboi—
ses ($27): roast duck pan seared, served below
a thick raspberry sauce with green beans and
potatoes aligot on the side. The duck’s cen-
ter was left pink, the juices secured beneath
the skin. The raspberry sauce was heavenly
because it highlighted the meat’s sweetness.
The potatoes aligot were my favorite: garlic
infused potatoes, with butter and Gruyere
cheese. They were light, and packed with ﬂa-
vor. .

Delighted by our entrees we continued on
to the crepe suzette. The sauce was sweet and
infused with the perfect amount of citrus,
although the actual crepe was a bit rubbery.
We ended the evening with two espressos,
perfectly pulled with the cream of the shot
layered on top of the drink.

The food was fantastic, but even more
importantly, so was the atmosphere. Ma

cold, rainy steel city. We need every escape
we can get.

Cavanaugh, Pitt h

ope to open u offense  

K_ by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Eaitor

With the weekend off from
games, the Pitt football team took
the time to prepare for Saturday’s
Iowa game and get healthy.

Pitt offensive coordinator
Matt Cavanaugh said late last
week that‘it was a good chance
for his offense to look at what
it’s been doing wrong and take an
extra step.

But history isn’t on the Pan-
thers’ side.

Since Pitt coach Dave Warmst—
edt arrived for the 2005 season,
the Panthers are 0-5 in games fol-
lowing bye weeks.

The Panthers hope this trend
will change when the Hawkeyes
come to Heinz Field Saturday at
noon.

Play-calling woes

Offensive coordinator Matt
Cavanaugh, who was criticized by
some for his play-calling in Pitt’s
opener against Bowling Green,
said that while he was disappoint-
ed with his play-calling in the
opener, he thought it improved

/

 

against Buffalo and thinks it will
continue to improve next week.
‘‘[It wasn’t] that much better,”
said Cavanaugh of the play-call-
ing against Buffalo. “But I think

we executed better.”

Cavanaugh said he’s looking a

forward to the matchup Saturday
against Iowa, and he thinks fresh-
man wide receiver Jonathan Bald-
win will see more action.

“We rotated our receiv-
ers a little bit more [against
Buffalo],” said Cavanaugh.

“We will rotate him in more. And a

I think with each week he’s learn-
ing more of the offense. He’s
certainly becoming more capable
of running more things. He’s get-
ting more comfortable and we’re
getting more comfortable with
him.”

Quarterback Greg Cross, a ju-
nior college transfer with speed,
could also see his ﬂrst action. But
only if the time is right.

Because Cross is more of a
running quarterback and has little
experience, Cavanaugh said he’ll
only be comfortable putting him
in if Pitt is in a certain situation.
He said that it’ll likely happen in

Lance Armstrong, who put together a string of seven straight Tour
de France wins, announced recently he's coming out of retirement.

the middle of the ﬁeld when Pitt
needs a change of pace.

“He’s been getting some more
reps,” said Cavanaugh. “We do
have a little package that we’ll in-
troduce. And need be or not, it’ll
show up this week.”

Have you heard the great
news?

Lance Armstrong recently an-
nounced he’s coming out of re-
tirement and will race in the Tour

de France next summer!

I’ll let that marinate in your
mind for a little bit and allow
you time to stop jumping up and
down and shrieking.

OK, you good now? It was a
nice feeling though, right?

In an interview with Vanity
Fair, a world—renowned_ fashion
and cycling magazine, Armstrong

With the Iowa game ap-
proaching, he said the team could
use the bye week to clean up the
offense and put together a solid
game plan.

And if Pitt begins executing
well on offense, he said the play-

said, “I’m going back to profes-
sional cycling. I’m going to try and
win an eighth Tour de France.”
If you didn’t already know,
Armstrong won every Tour de
France from 1999 through 2005
and then retired. I’m pretty sure
there’s at least one question about
that on the U.S. citizenship test,
just in case you ever have to take

. it. Not to cheat, but if you have

test form B, the answer is D.
This all came after he survived
a bout with testicular cancer in
1996. He also dated Sheryl Crow,
which probably won’t be on the
citizenship test, but if People
Magazine happens to e-mail you
a quiz, now you know. '

calls would immediately seem
better.

“If we’re doing things well,
then you feel comfortable calling
pretty much anything on the call-
sheet,” he said.

Notebook, page 14

 Lance is back-

The guy is like Superman, but
without a weakness and need for
an alter ego.

Next summer Armstrong will
be 37. The Tour de France, or
Le Tour de France in the native
tongue of the host country, is a
23-day «race, covering more than
2,000 miles. It also apparently
doesn’t allow cyclists to use ste-
roids anymore. So not only is ﬁn-
ishing it an accomplishment, but
watching it is pretty impressive._as
well.

Should Armstrong win, he
would be the oldest Tour de
France champion ever.

The current record is held by
Belgium’s Firrnin Lambot, who

  University of Pittsburgh

Armstrong could win eighth
straight, make America care

Littman, pagel-’-l

won the race at age 36. That was in 1922.

This news couldn’t have come at a better
time. The Olympics are over, and Shaquille
O_’Neal announced he’s retiring in a little
more than 700 days. Tiger Woods is injured
and hasn’t played golf in a few months,
and he won’t be back until next year. Tom
Brady is also out for the season. And just
this past weekend, Charlie Weis tore his left
ACL and MCL. '

A few bum knees and now we’re look-
ing at the American sports equivalent of
the Great Depression. We need something
to unite the country.

The Brady injury came close, but you
don’r want to unite the country through
one guy’s injury, do you? Well, maybe if it
was Curt Schilling, speciﬁcally (something
in the jaw region), that might do it.

America needs one athlete it could rally
behind, and who better than Lance Arm-
strong? -

The guy stands for all America loves.
He survived cancer, came into the Tour
de France as an underdog because of said
cancer and then won it. And he kept win-
ning it until they named the bicycle after
him (it hasn’t been announced yet — just
don’t tell anyone I told you). To top it off,
he dated a rock star.

If there’s one thing America loves, it’s
a great underdog story. And if there’s one
thing the country loves even more, it’s
complete and utter domination, speciﬁcally
when it comes to contests against competi-
tors from all over the world.

Still not amped up about this? He’s also
friends with Matthew McConaughey, the
guy who made, well, never mind. Imagine
if Armstrong won the race while McCon-
aughey rode in a basket on the front of the
bike, waving an American ﬂag the whole
race.

I know there’s this big election coming

up in November and the race isn’t until
next year, but I think we should all just take
a little bit of time each day to think about
him. Not a lot of time, but just for like two
hours, sit and thank Armstrong for gracing
this country with his supreme cycling skills
once again.

If you have an Armstrong poster, may-
be sit facing it.

It’s easy for me because I put one up on
every wall in my room. I also wear yellow
when I thank him.

Just to note, I’ve been doing this daily
since he won his fourth Tour de Force on
July 28, 2002, as a way to show him respect
for all he’s done for my faith in American
athletics.

If we all send him positive vibes, there’s
no reason he can’t win his eighth next sum-
mer. Then again, he’s such a superior hu-
man being that he doesn’t need any help
winning.

Not like those other fools, who thought
they could dope their way to the title. Who
won the Tour de France during any of the
years since Armstrong retired?

I’m not even sure they held the race
since he’s been gone. If they did, it didn’t
matter. Congrats to whoever won in those
years and all, but just know, your reign is
over.

lt’s not even fair that Armstrong is go-
ing to race again this year. To even the play-
ing ﬁeld, let all those guys take steroids. Or
make Armstrong race on a unicycle. Blind-
folded.

Make Armstrong start in America. If
there’s one guy who can bike the Atlantic,
it’s Lance Armstrong. A

There’s no doubt in my mind he could
still win it. He beat cancer. And while ‘not
as impressive, but quite close, he made
Americans pretend to care about cycling
for seven years.
