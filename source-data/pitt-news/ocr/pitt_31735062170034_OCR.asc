Statement

The following statement was issued by Chancellor Wesley Posvar:

    

These are turbulent times in universities across the land and
around the world. In some places. the action has taken the form
of physical obstruction and crime that led. in turn. to sever
counter-measures. This has understandably captured the atten-
tion and aroused the anxiety of many; in a few places abroad.
academic institutions have been permanently crippled or des-
troyed by internal disorder. ’

In the face of these dismal events. it is essential to remind
ourselves that far more often, and on the part of countless more
students and faculty. the prime purposes if: these times are con-
structive re-examinations of the aims of society. of the mission of
the university. and of the content of higher education. This vast
majority is dedicated not only to progress. but to the preserva-
tion of the free academic environment that is necessary to prog-
ress, and for the rule of law that is the safeguard of the right to
dissent.

This is certainly true at the University of Pittsburgh. Many
students and faculty express the positive wish to imporve the uni-
versity in order to make it more responsive to contemporary
needs. I share their objective. I also believe that actions taken
in the past year and other actions now being considered are evi-
dence that progress can be made in a rational manner and that
it can be made rapidly.

Let me briefly review the past year. A primary concern has
been the need to broaden student participation, not just in the
regulation of student activities, but also to involve students more
widely in the various phases of the university policy-making
process. Thus, at their own request, students are now represent-
ed on all committees of the Faculty Senate and in cabinets and
councils of schools. Students have also accepted broad responsi-
bility for establishing, enforcing and adjudicating regulations
that cover social life and conduct. Student leaders on the Stu-
dent Affairs Advisory Committee meet regularly with me and
other university officers, and the president of Student Govern-
ment regularly attends sessions of the Faculty Senate and the
Senate Council. I

To involve students more effectively in academic matters.
last fall the university organized, under the leadership of Asso-
ciate Provost J. Steele Gow, Jr., and Undergraduate Academic
Council, including students from all the undergraduate schools.
A similar Graduate Aca'demic4Council is now being developed.

  

   
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
   
   
   
   
   
 
   
    
    
  
   
   
    
    
  
 
  
 
   
  
   
   
     
   
  
  
    
  
   
  
  
    
   
   
 
   
    
 
   
   
   
  
    
 
 
  
   
   
   
   
  
  
    
    
 

' ' As a further step, trustees, students and faculty have held
several informal meetings recently and more such meetings are
now being planned. William H. Rea, chairman of the university’s
Board of Trustees, has proposed, and I concur, that students, fac-
ulty, administrators and trustees should be brought together on
a more regular basis to discuss and suggest improvements in
structure and communication. These efforts. I believe, are de-
veloping more full and free discussion. and I expect that the ef-
fort to find still better methods will continue.

Of particular concern to studentsand faculty is the need for
reform in such matters as curriculum, grading practices, degree
requirements and academic standards. Specific proposals are now
being considered in several schools and departments. I consider
it important that the faculties, which have basic prerogatives in
academic matters, recognize that student contributions to aca-
demic decisions can be insightful and creative. I urge both. stu-
dents and faculty to work together to enable student contribu-
tions to become useful elements in this fundamental academic
area.

Recently it has been suggested that a space be made readily
available to students and faculty to conduct educational activ-
ities of their own devising and. on a spontaneous basis. I believe
this ideas has merit, and I am pleased to announce that tem-
porary space has been assigned for this purpose in the Social
Sciences Building until the end of the current term. Subsequent-
ly, the Provost will attempt to identify permanent space avail-
able for such use.

Aside from the vital issues of the character and meaning of
the educational process, other kinds of issues are being discussed
involving, for example, university employment practices and our
relationships with the general community. One example is the
question of wages for university employees. I have been inform-
ed that amoung out 5.300 full—time staff members. no one earns
less than the Federal minimum wage for non—profit institutions.
which is $1.30 per hour, and only a few earn less than $1.60 per
hour, which is the Federal minimum for commercial concerns.
Prior plans call for bringing all wages up to the latter level by
September 1.

I have repeatedly stressed that this university will not tol-
erate any prejudicial hiring practices. Beyond that, we are mak-
ing strong efforts to employ more black persons in the faculty
and staff. Recently, the U.S. Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, reviewing compliance with Federal anti-discrim-
ination laws, commended this university’s black recruitment ef-
forts as notably effective among universities around the nation.

The university’s relationship with its neighbors and the gen-
eral community are vitally important. One step has been’ that. on
February 10. a program to open Trees Hall to the immediate
community was resumed and expanded. Under this program.
funded by the university and others. we estimate that 25.000 per-
sons will use’ the swimming pools and gymnasium facilities be-
tween February and June. and 55.000 will use them in the subse-
quent fiscal year. A committee including persons from the im-
mediate community plans and supervises these activities. In ad-
dition to recreational programs. the university has a number of
educational. cultural and medical programs that serve our neigh-
borhood.

On a related topic. we are very much aware that the physi-
cal growth of an urban university must take place in harmony
with its community. We do attempt to work closely with com-
munity agencies in developing ourplans. In the past. the uni-
versityhas purchased few private dwellings that displaced fam-

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Program Gives Credit, Grades

Watson Explains ‘Exchange’

by HARRIS MILLER
Staff News Writer

Juniors and seniors in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences will
next year be able to travel to four
other colleges and universitites in
order to expand their liberal arts
program. In an exclusive inter-
view with The Pitt News, Dr.
James G. Watson, assistant dean
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences, said that upperclassmen
from the University, Carlow Col-
lege (the new name that Mt.
Mercy soon will take), Chatham
College, Duquesne University,
and Carnegie-Mellon University
will be able to take one course

per term at any of the other four

cooperating schools.

Dr. Watson pointed out that
the Pittsburgh Council of Higher
Education, a local organization
dedicated to improving the qual-
ity of the education in the area,
had presented this plan. (Dr.
Daniel Rathbone is the Univer-
sity representative on the Co-
cil. ) The assistant dean stated that
the program will definitely be-
gin with the Fall term, but he

. added, “The machinery is still in

the process of being worked out."

Commenting on the conse-
quences of the exchange, Dr. Wat-
son related, “The University has

the largest and most prestigous
liberal arts school so that the stu-
dents at other schools will give
the University the largest load of
students.” He went on to say that

only certain courses at each‘

school will be open and that none
of the schools have yet finalized
this open list including the Uni-
versity.

While lacking some details, Dr.
Watson was able to explain a few
of the new rules. For instance,
there is a new cross-registration
form that will have to be com-
pleted. Since many upperclass-
men are registered or will be reg-
istering before the program is
ready for implementation, some

MONDAY, MARCH 24, 1 9459, "

students may have to re-register
if they wish to take advantage of
this offer. Also, full credit and
a grade will be given for each
course. Each student’s transcript
will note that the course has been
taken at another school. *

According to Dr. Watson, this

program is already in progress be-
tween Carnegie — Mellon and

Chatham. Also, “Amherst, Smith ’

and the University of Massachu-
setts work together on a similar
program.” While Dr. Watson did
term the exchange “experimen-
tal,” he expressed hope that the
program would work for the mu-
tual benefit of the schools in-
volved.

The Judicial Problem

by TONI GROSSI
Contributing Columinist

A fine example of administrative in-
eptitude was displayed Tuesday night in
the University Housing Office when eight
students were given 48 hour notice of their
suspension from the dormitories. (The sus-
pensions were later lifted in seven of the
eight cases.)

This ruling was not within the legal
jurisdiction of the Housing Office. It was
obviously made at a time when the Hous-
ing Office was under a great deal of pres-
sure and didn’t have adequate time to con-
sider the individual situations of the stu-
dents. Sound legal practice was blatantly
ignored by making the ruling on the night
of the alleged “crimes.”

Their actions, further, casually'disre-
garded the four-and-a-half year old Wom-
en’s Judicial Board and the newly recog-
nized Men’s Judicial Board. The Women's
Judicial Board is the University rec-
ognized (as clarified in the Judicial Board
Housing Office jurisdictions agreement in

" I October, 1968)‘ first step for violations,

other than civil arrests, within the wom-
en’s dormitory area. This Board had the

' legal jurisdiction in the cases of the wom-

en students Tudesday night by due pro-
cess of the judicial system at Pitt.

EQUALLY SO, if the Men’s Judicial
Board was organized enough to have their
by-laws and constitution approved two
weeks ago by Dean Pease, dean of stu-
dents, they should be organized enough to
have been contacted concerning the sus-
pensions of the men students by the Hous-
ing Office.

The Housing Office had no right to
make any legally binding decisions con-
cerning the students. The cases should
have been referred immediately to action
by the respective judicial boards. Appeal
action should be to the University Review
Board.

This available mechanism was not util-
ized and even worse, those people, i.e.
Dean Pease; Dr. Critchfield, vice-chancel-
lor of Student Affairs; and Scott Baum,
SG president, who should be aware ofthe
correct procedures, were not. The situa-
tion which actually occurred caused un-

necessary anguish for the eight students
involved.

—Women’s Judicial Board members con-
tacted the Housing Office to inquire who
had made the suspension decision. They
were informed that the Housing Office
had made it the preceding evening and
that the decision was final. The Board
members refused to support the Housing
Office's decision and criticized the Hous-

ing Office for not going through the prop-

er student boards. /
—AFTER SOME delay, due to the rec-_
ommendations of the Legal Awareness
Committee, the girls had their hearings be-
fore the Judicial Board. A final decision
was made in each case, subject ot appeal.

The confusion so evident in the above
proceedings was avoidable if the correct
channels had been deployed in the first
place. The student Judicial Boards should
have handled the cases which were not in
the jurisdiction of the Housing Office.

Appeals should be made to the Univer-
sity Review Board (until the time, hope-
fully, that an intermediate all University
co—ed board is established) not to Dean
Pease or Dr. Critchfield and not to the
_Judicial Boards as it appears that the Hous-
ing Office thought.

THE WOMEN'S Housing Board, cred-
ited by the Houing Office and Dean
Pease as not wishing to hear the case, is
not a Judicial Board and has no such pow-
er to hear cases, therefore, it had no right
to hear the cases.

The recommendations and actions of
SG and the Legal Awareness Committee
makes it apparent that they do not have
an accurate picture of the judicial system
at Pitt.

There is no attempt here to debate the
issue of punishing students during parity
raids—that is another very larege question
in itself. The issue, as I see it, is that of
the right of the University to set an exam-
ple by suspending students from the dor-
mitories without giving the students: a) A_
hearing by their peers; b) Adequate time
to prepare a defense, and c) A clear defin-
ition of_ the legal procedure involved.

lies. As we view expansion in the decade ahead, few families are expected to be dis-

placed. Nevertheless, the university recognizes that its presence may aggravate housing A

conditions; for_example, when students act_ individually to acquire housing, other per-
sons may be displaced. We have a responsibility in this regard. Our housing office is
examining how it could help those in the community who may need housing assistance.

As the university moves ahead to act on these and other issues, it is important to
keep in mind that the academic environment and the decision-making process must be
held free of disruption, threats and intimidation that have interfered with the educa-

tional process at other institutions. It is clearly my

Anti-Ballistic Missile Defenclecl

Editor, The Pitt News:

Bob Bonn would have done his read-
ers a greater service last Friday if, in his
article on the anti-ballistic missile, he had
reported what was said at the meeting he
attended rather than devoting a consider-
able portion of his article to an attack on
hate and a eulogy of love. The fact is that
the article fails to bring out some of the
important poi-nts made at the meeting.

All members of the panel were opposed
to bloodshed. The question discussed was
whether an anti-ballistic missile system
might, at some reasonable cost, be expect-
ed to appreciably reduce bloodshed. It is
strange that Mr. Bonn concluded, “I guess
we need the ABM,” because two of the

Relocating Problems

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to express my concern over
the housing shortage for relocating stu-
dents. I  in the process of relocating to
the Oak,la"-;:;:I;:;:l Campus from the regional
campus at "E-Bradford, Pa. On March 12, a
meeting of relocating students was held,
at which time an announcement was made
concerning University housing. We were
notified that only 12 rooms were available
for relocating men and 15 for ‘women.

I question the fairness of these pro-
ceedings. I feel that if the University of
Pittsburgh maintains regional campuses,
it should take the responsibility for assur-

ing the students attending them University ,

housing at the time of their relocation.
Preference should be given to relocating
students over all incoming freshmen and
transfer students. '

The inavailability of University hous-
ing places students incuncalled-for finan-
cial difficulties. .,Livin"g off—campus may
change the amount awarded through state
and various local scholarships. Obviously,
students would be penalized becuase of
circumstances beyond their control.

I am not voicing this complaint solely
because of the present situation;--‘Even if,
by chance, all of our relocating students
are eventually‘ given University housing,
I feel that the matter still should not be
dropped. Some decision must be reached
in regard to the proper consideration to-be
given to students attending regional cam-
puses.

three speakers on the panel to which he
listened (?) concluded that, at least under
the present circumstances, we do not need
the ABM.

Grave doubts were expressed about the
technical reliability of the system. Serious
questions were raised about the original-
ly expressed purpose of the thin Sentinel
system, i.e. to protect us against a “mad-
dog” Chinese attack. (The new line is that
the system is supposed to protect our coun-

terforce missiles, not our cities. And it is ,'
supposed to protect them from the Rus-'

sians, not the Chinese.) The likelihood that
deployment of an ABM system would sim-
ply provoke a beefing—up of offensive mis-
sile systems in the U.S. and USSR was
discussed. These are points which should
cause the most devoted military man, not
to speak of Mr. Bonn, to doubt that “we
need the ABM.”

There are circumstances in which those
of us who would like to see international
problems settled by negotiation rather
warfare might conceivably welcome bal-
listic missile defense. For example, at one

 
  
 
   
 

stage in a phased world disarmament it’

might greatly add to security of all nations
if offensive missile sites were replaced by
defensive sites. The issue of ballistic mis-
sile defense should be considered, there-

fore, in the broader context of arms control-,a;

and the world political situation.

It is true, as Mr. Bonnsuggests, that
we must love, love and hate, hate, but this
is not enough. Even for men of good will
it is difficult to achieve cconc/liation.
There are technical and political problems
to be solved. The mind has a role to play
as well as the heart. Those of us in univer-
sities have a special duty to try to think
and speak clearly on the complex issues
facing mankind.

LaPietra Will Be Missed

 

 
 

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Associate Editor

I’m going to miss Jack LaPietra.

Jack is a sincere individual whose in-
tegrity can never be questioned. He has
always displayed a great moral sense of
right and wrong and willingness to follow
the rules. Always conducting himself in a

genltlemanly manner, Jack rarely loses his
coo .

We first met last
summer. A genuine
friendship quickly de-
veloped between us be-
cause of our mutual in-
terest in working for
the student at the Uni- '
versity. Unfortunately,
our philosophies toward
achieving this end were
entirely different.

Mr. levenson

IT PROBABLY CAME as a surprise to
both of us that we ended up on opposing
sides of nearly every campus issue. But, I
don’t think that this ever interfered with
our friendship or respect for each other.

Not too long ago I wrote an article
damning the Commuter Association, an or-
ganization in which Jack served as presi-
dent. Jack immediatelyreplied to my ac-
cusations in a letter .publishe._c_l in _,Th__e Pitt.

   

 

  
    

mitted to many of the shortcomings out-
lined in the article. He also voiced dis-
agreement with other parts of it. Jack
could have denounced the column entire-
ly, whether he believed that or not. He
could have resorted to some name-calling
as lS quite often done in similar situations.
Instead, he stuck to the issues and was
willing to put his beliefts on the line, as
I had mine.

At the recent Commuter Association
elections meeting, I was part of a group
that revealed many weaknesses in the As-
sociation’s Constitution and procedures,
Jack never lost his temper or his sense of
justice during these proceedings. I be-
lieve that he tried to do what was morally
right under these trying circumstances.

THE ONLY FAULT that I found in
Jack was that he spread himself too thin.
He served as SG senator, president of the
Commuter Association, head of the Cadet
Brigade, and a few other things simul-
taneously. On a couple of his activities,
he didn’t accomplish as much as he would
have liked, but I don't believe that it was
because of apathy or laziness. He just did-

 

n’t have the time. Jack is far from being?‘

an apathetic student.
He is my kind of person—an .activ1gt_

Outdoor Track Season Open

‘We Have Quality, Need

More uantit ’-Banner
V

by BOB LEDERMAN

If you should see Jim Banner walking around with a rab-
bit’s foot these days, don’t be too surprised. It’s not that he’s
overly superstitious, it’s just that he’s wary of the one thing
that could destroy an otherwise bright season — injuries. Ban-
ner’s toughest job seems to be getting more depth. _

“Overall we’re pretty strong, but the biggest thing is lack

of depth. We just don’t have any
depth yet. What we have is qual-
ity and we don’t have the quan-
tity yet.”

The 120 yard high hurdles is
one such event where Banner
feels the lack of depth may make
"its mark. Elliot Drysdale, who
normally runs in this event, will
not be competing this year due
to injuries he suffered in an auto-
mobile accident. As a result,
Dave Brinn will be the thinclads’
lone entrant in the hurdles com-
petition.

“Dave will do a good job, but
there's nobody to back him up,”

JERRY RICHEY
Old Reliable

With a successful winter cam-
paign behind them, the tracksters
are eager to “tear up” the out-
door track. The five week sched-
ule will send the thinclads on to
the KentuckyyRelays during the
first week in April, then the West
Virginia and Ohio State Relays,
followed by the Penn Relays. Af-
ter the relays, the thinclads will
begin running in the Stadium,
first hosting the Big Four Meet
(Pitt, Penn State, West Virginia
and Syracuse), then Wayne Uni-
versity and finally Temple.

In the 440—yard intermediate,
hurdles, the trackmen have a,
strong offering in Carlos Reisen,

Smitty Brown and Wall Swiger.
Reisen, who finished sixth in the
IC4A’s last year, could be one of

the top runners in the East.

The half mile will probably see
Dick Werner and John Aiden,

while the mile event will offer

the familiar faces of Jerry Rich-

ey, Mark Vornhagen, Craig Rod-

 gers and Mike Nolan.

Spring Practices Begin Friday;
DePasqua Studies Players Live

It may seem a bit early, but the
football team will begin tw 0
weeks of practice Friday after-
noon at Pitt Stadium.

Spring drills will be devoted
to fundamentals. Coach Carl De-
Pasqua will use the drills to eval-
uate the nearly 100 players slated
to participate.

“We are trying to get our pro-
gram organized and evaluate the
squad,” said DePasqua recently.
“We have to learn, the players in-
side and out during spring prac-

tice so we can reach some im-
portant decisions.”

DePasqua has already started
the unenviable task of [learning
the players “inside and out.” He
has been studying films of cur-
rent gridders. Returning from
last year's miserable, l-9, cam-
paign are 34 lettermen.

s April 5th  

Smitty Brown is one of the big reasons for trackster success in the 440

yard intermediate hurdles. The sophomore speedster has a supporting

Wally Swiger.

Brynat Salter will be handling
the chores in the high jump and
the triple jump, while the long
jump will be capably taken care
of by John Geron and Rudy Huf-
nagle.

Other field entrants are Dan
_Kouvolo in the javelin toss, Jeff
Snyder in the pole valult, and
Greg Ellis in both the shot put
and discuss competitions.

‘ cast of Carlos Reisen (who finished sixth in the IC4A’s last year) and

The tracksters appear pretty

strong. If the lack of depth does

not become a problem, then there
is no reason why the thinclads
won’t continue the success they
enjoyed this past winter. Jim Ban-
ner, however, is careful not to
look too far ahead at this time.

“We’ll do it like we did in-
doors,” said Banner. “We’ll take
it one meet at a time and see what
happens.”

Miami Tourney Begins

Bobby Lewis and his Panther baseball squad made it to
Miami over the weekend without being hijacked. So, they won’t
need any one to interpret Spanish. They will, however, need
a little help to figure out the set-up of the University of Miami
Tournament that they’re competing in starting today when they
go nine innings against Michigan State. -

Lewis thought that the tourney
would be an easy-to-understand
“round robin” type — one where
all the teams play each other once
and the team with the best record
takes the title. But,._ the mitters
won’t play all the teams entered.
In fact, they’ll only play three of
them.

Today’s game against the Spar-
tans will be the first of three en-
counter’s with Coach Dan Litwyl-
er’s team; the mitters will battle
the Miami Hurricanes three
times during the next three days.
The A baseballers ‘will also take one
shot at Coach Costa Kittle’s Flor-
ida A. & M. nine.

As if that scheduling isn’t bad
enough, Michigan State has al-
ready been in Coral Gables (lo-
cale of the ball park) for a week.

Lewis doesn’t pretend to under-
stand any of this. He admitted, “I

just don’t see how they’re going
to pick a champion.”

That doesn’t concern him,
though. The main purpose for this
trip is not to come home a cham-
pion. I

“Some people might think so,
but we're not going on a vaca-
tion,” the coach said. “We’re go-
ing to play.”

It’s a good guess that every-
body on the 25-man Panther
squad will get to play during the
busy week of seven games in six
days, too. Today’s starters: Earl
Bellisario, Cliff Brown, Ron
Howie, and Rock Snyder in the
infield; Bob Kohl, Joe McCain,
and either John Fredland, Rick
Wermuth, or Jeff Barr in the out-
field; and Sammy Glass behind
the plate receiving the tosses from
from George Medich.
