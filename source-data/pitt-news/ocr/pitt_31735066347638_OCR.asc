years, and tuition increased 25-

administrative costs have been cut

‘ ' back about as far as possiblejand
this year’s deﬁcit will hit even

harder. ‘
In basic ﬁgures, Pitt asked
Governor Milton Shapp for an

 _ overall appropriation of $69.5

million; Shapp countered with a
suggestion of $61 .9 million, and the
state legislature began last week to
consider a compromise.

It is possible the legislators will
decidelto grant Pitt all of its $9.1
million increase request‘, but highly
unlikely. In past years, the -state

i f house and senate committees
A usually hiked Pitt’s allocation over

the Governor’s measly proposal,
butthe legislature's revision never
met Pitt’_s original request.

scenario optimistically or realisti-

Irvis Pushes Tenant Rights

BY JOSEPH HAYDEN ‘

Landlordretaliation against ten-
ants who report lease violations to
government agencies may be
eliminated by legislation currently
under scrutiny -in the state house.

. House -Bill 402, sponsored by.

Oakland representative K. Leroy
Irvis, requires landlords to comply
with building and housing codes,
maintain efﬁcient utilities and
provide for emergency repairs

within 48 hours pending notiﬁcation -

by the County Board of Health.

According to Irvis staff member

Deborah Madvick, the legislation -

would attempt to clarify existing
-landlord-tenant laws. “We are
trying to establish a baseline for
rules and regulations that would
correlate both sides of landlord-
tenant issues,” Madvicék said.- “
There, deﬁnitely would be an
‘ improvement in terms of giving the
student more legal rights, accord-
ing to Legal Awareness Committee
member Bruce Stephens.

“One of the problems inthe past ,

lack of student

has been a

awareness,” Stephens said, in'dica- .

would ‘ spur

“Students can now take ‘legal

” action even if minor repairs are not

completed,” Stephens said.

“Usually students‘ take their

services at face value and do not

want to go through all the legal.

hassle,” Stephens said.

He said students are urged to go
to the County Board of ‘Health to ﬁle
complaints, but the time lag is too
long and discourages their involve-
ment.

The bill also requires tenants to‘

comply with countybuilding codes,
provide clean living conditions,
prevent property damage and
regularly pay rent.

' Daniel Mosse, a Pittsburgh
realtor, feels the bill could help
students and landlords to. interact
with each other.

“Students and landlords must
always work together’ in cleaning
and repairing their apartments, and
it looks like the proposal will
continue these good relations,”

Mosse said.

Under the bill tenants can
terminate a lease through legal
means if a_ landlord fails to comply

Malicious mischief is the cause of
problems with the ﬁre alarm system
in the Towers, according to Housing
Director Donovan Hughes.

Although false ﬁre alarms were

. on the rise this year, most incidents

in the quadrangle are triggered by
the sensitivity of the newly installed '
smoke detectors. The Towers,
classiﬁed as ﬁre proof by the
building codes, have no smoke
detectors.

‘ ‘Someone has to set off those ﬁre

alarms in the Towers,” Hughes

said. “I think there’s been more
trouble with the .alarms in the

corridors there.”

Pitt Tuition Increase Lik

going to be spending the next»
month or two looking for ways to ﬁll
in the $5-9 million budgetary gap.

Taking $5’million as the ﬁgure
Pitt must come up - with, and
dividing it by the 26,000 ﬁgure for
full—time equivalent enrollment, a
tuition hike slightly under $200
would be necessary. But nothing is
that simple; and at this point,
anything is possible.

Posvar has stated time and time
again he takes no pride in having to
raise tuition. Given the choice, he
has said, Pitt would be free.
Students can assume he will be
looking for other ways to pay the
heat b_ills than socking the students
with a hefty bill of their own.

But on the other hand, Posvar and
administrators repeatedly
insist there is little or no cutable
excess in the Pitt budget, and any

_ further cuts are going to negatively .

effect the quality of education here.
Either way, it seems, Pitt students
are going to be paying more for less.
Those that can pay, that is. Some,
no doubt, will be dropping out
before next September is here.
Between 1973 and 1975, Pitt’s
tuition jumped 14 percent and in the
same period, the number of
freshmen from families below the

national median income dropped‘

ﬁve percentage points. This year’s
six percent tuition hike didn’t,help,
and another one, of course, won’t
help either.

Pitt tuition ($1,210 for undergrad-
uates) already towers above that of
neighboring state universities. Ohio
students pay $825 per year, West
Virginians pay only $403. New
York, New Jersey, Virginia, Indi-
ana, Maryland, Kentucky; they all
educate their students for less than
Pennsylvania.

The reason . for this, stated
simply, is the administration, if you
ask students; the stingy state
government, if you ask administra-
tors; or the penny-pinching taxpay-
ers, if you care to ask Governor
Shapp or your state legislators.

alarm service. During a false ﬁre
alarm on Tower A's 17th floor, the
building was not properly evacu-
ated, Hughes said.

“As I understand it, someone tore
the cover off the alarm on the
seventh ﬂoor and rewired the bell so
it short circuited the alarm,”
Hughes said. “It concerns me that
peoplethink it is amusing ‘enough to
risk jeopardizing the lives of other
people.”

“It’s nearly impossible to ﬁnd out
who did this,” admitted campus

A security investigator Charles Bre-

vard.

‘Brevard said steps are being
taken to prevent further incidents. -

:

This is nothing new. It happens
year after year, and it ishdifﬁcult to

predict the end‘ result until all the ,

ﬁgures are in and the budget’
ofﬁcers are given some time to

brood over them. In the past few A

years, student representatives have
been allowed to play a larger part in
the budgetary process, but little
else has changed.

Unless the improbable miracle in
"Harrisburg develops, tradition will

continue with yet another increase"

ROTC—Still No Credit

Air Force and Army ROTC students have started another drive '

to obtain accreditation for ROTC courses taken through the

College of Arts and Sciences.

ROTC lost CAS accreditation in 1968, and attempts" to regain it
over the past nine years have failed. This time the backers hope
the anti-military sentiment among students and faculty has
changed sufficiently to remove accreditation opposition.

The decision to keep ROTC on this campus, with or without
credit, should not be based on short term trends. Instead, it must
reflect a University examination of facts and how ROTC facts

support or conflict with the moral and educational obligations of ;

this institution of higher education.

It has been and still is the opinion of The Pitt News that the
decision to deny ROTC course accreditation is based on reﬂection
and consideration of facts, and therefore a commitment by the

CAS they cannot renege.

 

Campus sentiment may have
changed in two years, but the
military hasn’t.

Two years ago we supported
the idea of having an army of
college educated military
officers, but felt that this was no
excuse to keep ROTC on a
university campus. The military
courses can be taught elsewhere,
perhaps at a nearby federal
institution or Officers
Candidates School while liberal
arts credits are earned on a
college campus.

Keeping ROTC on campus compromised Pitt’s humanitarian
beliefs and provided ROTC with a public relations department,

we said.

Though the humanities augment officer training, nothing
requires Pitt to espouse the military arts and serve as a base for

their instruction, we concluded.

No matter how compassionately

ROTC candidates learn military service, Pitt could have no pride
in the fact that they learned it here.

The above points were true two years ago and still hold true
today. The spirit of ROTC and the humanitarian beliefs of this
University were diametrically opposed two years ago.. Nothing.
has changed in the interim. Therefore, ROTC still conflicts with
the interests of the University and has no place on this -campus.

Points Behind

‘ BY BOB PELLEGRINI

V. It has been nine years since
ROTC was denied academic credit
for its courses. At the time. the
United States was just entering the
worst period of the Vietnam war and
the draft was in full swing. It was a
time of protest and ROTC was an
easily'"-Wdentiﬁable target‘:' its
members wore uniforms, they

marched and they were a constant.

reminder of the war of the

government that fought that war.
Critics of ROTC like to remember
it as a time when thestudents got
together and dealt a blow to
militarism on campus. Actually, at
the time, most students were in
favor of ROTC retaining credit. In
the only referendum ever taken on
accreditation for ROTC in January,
1968, the vote was 1,686 to 494 in
favor of ROTC. Admittedly, only a
small portion of the student
population voted, but it has never

been shown that the majority of Pitt
students, or even a large -minority,
were ever opposed to ROTC
receiving credit. ‘

Since 1968, the ROTC depart-
ments have been trying to get credit
reinstated, but even after the end of
the war and the end of the draft,
ROTC is still receiving criticism
from various groups. This is not to

arguments against ROTC receiving -'

credit—there are—but' in the ' end,
the case for giving credit to ROTC is
stronger. .
A prevalent argument against
I ROTC throughout the years of
debate was that ROTC was part of a
military establishment that was
somehow immoral. In an article
appearing last week in the Pitt
News,'one author felt that, in the
present political context, a ‘military
career was morally unacceptable.
As a society usually ends up with
the kind of government it deserves,
it also ends up with the.‘ kind of
military it deserves._, If the military

is immoral, it is because the society
that sustains it is immoral. If a
career in the military is morally
unacceptable. in

the American people have allowed
that political context to be corrupt.

ROTC is that the University of

logy and psychology. To be sure,
each course is taught with military
objectives in mind, such as the
psychology of leadership and group
dynamics. The history taught is
military history. Military science
courses are listed in the course
catalog and are open for attendance
by any individual at any time
without notice.

A major objection that some
people have toward ROTC is that
the goals of the University and the
goals of the military are different, or
even opposed. In truth, this
argument has some merit. '

Higher education is an optimistic
part of society because it tries to
build up our level of culture and
improve the way we live. The
is a
pessimistic part of society; its role is
to defend us from those who we

believe, sometimes rightly, often,

wrongly, are trying to‘ destroy our
culture. By having a military
establishment we acknowledge the
fact that men are sometimes evil.
So, in a sense, the purpose of the
University and the purpose of the
military (and ROTC) are opposed.
But another purpose of the
University is to prepare its students

for a career in society; a society that
includes doctors, lawyers, engin-
eers—for better or worse——soldiers.

7 Letters to the Editor

UGE Responds to
’ Harman Points

In the March 7 issue of the Pitt
News, the University's Director of
Legal Services, William J. Hannan,
is quoted as saying that the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board (PLRB) ruled that teaching
assistants (TA’s), teaching fellows
(TF’s), and graduate student
assistants (GSA’s) are not em-
ployes.

“The PLRB decided they were
students,” he said, “and until this
decision changes, we will treat them
as students.” ,

The Union of Graduate Employ-
es (UGE) would like to point out that
Mr. Hannan’s explanation of the
PLRB decision is a serious
distortion of the truth. The PLRB
ruled explicitly that TA’s, T F ’.s, and
GSA’s are employes. Its decision
says: “TA’s, TF’s and GSA’s are
graduate students of the University
who are employed by the University
to teach or to engage in research.
They are paid up to $3,000 per year
and work the equivalent of one-third

or two-thirds the time of a full-time
faculty member...They are covered
by Social Security, workman’s
compensation and all other indicia
of employes, but are not treated like
faculty, and are not given beneﬁts
usually accorded to faculty mem-
bers or even to staff members
(PLRB Decision “University of
Pittsburgh of the Commonwealth
System of Higher Education, Case
#PERA-R-S237W, Jan. 22,.l976, pp.
5-6).” Yet although the board .
acknowledges that we are employ-
es, it will not sponsor a collective
bargaining election for us because it
is not sure that employes who are
also enrolled as students fall under
its jurisdiction (see p. 13 of same
decision).

There is yet another distortion in
Mr. Hannan’s comments. . He says
that the Chancellor is on record that
until such time as the law classiﬁes
graduate students who are paid by
the University as employes rather
than students the University will
continue to consider them students.

On Feb. 28, members of the UGE
talked with Chancellor Posvar in a
meeting arranged through the
Graduate and Professional Student
Association. At this meeting the

UGE members asked Chancellor
Posvar how he would respond if a

majority of TA’s, TF’s, GSA’s and

graduate student researchers

(GSR’s) vote in favor of collective
bargaining in the March 23 and 24
election. Initially he responded by
saying that we were asking him a
“what if” question, which in all
fairness he could not answer at the
time. Then during a more general
discussion of collective bargaining,
the Chancellor said that if any
section of the University is
confronted with the question of
unionization, the decision should be
made by that constituency. Clearly

the Chancellor is adopting a “wait .

and see” attitude which Mr.
Hannan’s remarks fail to take into
account.

All of Pitt's TA’s, TF’s, GSA’s
and GSR's should keep these
remarks by the Chancellor in mind
as the March 23 and 24 collective
bargaining election approaches.
Once the results of the election
become public, UGE trusts that
Chancellor Posvar will deal in a
responsible way with the democrat-
ically-expressed will of the graduate
employes.

$-

 

BY DAVE McDONALD

In the landlord-verses-tenant
battle there is only one legal
weapon—-the lease. In the ﬁnal
battleground, the courts, the law
will uphold just about anything
included in a written lease, whether
it be in the landlord’s or tenant’s
favor. Because of this, it is _very
important to read and understand

“the lease before you sign for an

apartment.
Leases come
ﬂavors: standard form, private and

‘ oral. The standard formlease is the

most widely used type of lease. This
is a typed lease—all the person
renting has to do is to ﬁll in .the
blanks. .

The standard lease is -very
contract-like and states the condi-
tions the landlord and tenant must
follow. Be very careful to read all
parts of this type of lease, for the
stipulations often are more beneﬁ-
cial to the landlord thari_the tenant.
Once you sign the lease, you are
bound by its conditions. *

Another type of lease, the private

agreement, is a hand-written,

in three basic-

informal document stating the
terms of the lease. This homemade
lease is just as binding as the
standard form, but is more ﬂexible
with less stipulations. Also, make
sure all terms in a lease of this type
are clear.

. The third type of lease, the oral
agreement, is as legally binding as
the other two. A disadvantage with
this type of lease is that the landlord
may attempt to demand performan-
ces not originally agreed upon. A
plus on the tenant’s side is that with
an oral lease he can pack his bags
and move without giving the
landlorda notice. When leaving, as
with any contractual arrangement,
it is best to get the agreement put on
paper. 

The ﬁrst thing with which the
tenant should concern himself is the
duration of the lease--when the
term of occupancy begins and ends.
For students, there are - usually
three lengths of leases: month-to-
month, year-to-year, and school-
term. ‘

A month-to-month lease is
renewed by continued occupancy,

' and a 30-day notice must be given to

leave.

A year-to-year lease is the same .

as the month-to-month lease, but is
renewed annually. The Off-Campus
Housing Ofﬁce warns that contin-
_ued occupancy beyond the given
year may obligate the lessee to an
additional year’s rent payment. The
school-term lease covers the length
of the school year.

Almost all leasespspecify rent is to
be paid in monthly installments.

One of the most important
clauses in the lease, and one that
often causes headaches at lease’s
end, is the security’ deposit. The
security deposit is the legal weapon
the landlord can hold over a tenant
who damages an apartment or
doesn’t pay rent.

I poyjr REMEMBER SEEDJC. ANYTHMC
Rmuf ms IN THE. LEASE ., . .

 

lit

The amount of the deposit varies,
but it usually is close to one month's
rent. Two months’ rent is the legal
maximum. Damage in an apartment
is deﬁned as anything that goes
beyond the normal wear and tear of
daily living.

A smart lessee will go through the
apartment before listing all dama-
ges and having the landlord sign the
list, to avoid being billed for already
present damage. .

The landlord must return the
security deposit within 30 days of a
lease’s termination, provided no
damages were incurred. If he
believes there are damages, the
landlord must provide a listing,
along with payment of the money
remaining after payment for the
damages.

Ex-Panther SmithNow All-A merica

BY STEVEHSYBERT A

When Curtis Smith performed on
the Pitt specialty teams from 1973 to
1975, he never even came close to
attaining All-American status. This

 year, however, though. his college-

eligibility had expired, he ﬁnally
reached that‘ goal. His accomplish-
ment came not on the gridiron, but
_on the mats in the third annual
Taekwondo Amateur Athletic Union
(AAU)_ national championships
March 5-6 in Berkeley, California.
. Smith, a Pitt graduate student,
.went to California with only one idea
in mind—to rank ﬁrst in the nation
in martial arts and attain the elusive

All-American honor.
And he did well. Not only did

the same club and the club did so _

well, I guess that’s good. Our

Smith ﬁnish second in ﬁghting and 3 -

third in forms (the ﬁrst three 
ﬁnishers in each event became "5

All-America in the eyes of the
AAU), his team, the Lake Erie
Association. (LEA), captured the
team national title.

LEA did so well in the
competition that Smith was even-
tually paired with and lost to
teammate “Chappy” Johnson in
the ﬁghting’ ﬁnals after

throughout‘ the match, but was
assessed a penalty late in the match
because of a kick to Johnson’s

groin. That penalty cost him points, , ‘

and, subsequently, the match, but
Smith was not overly disturbed.

the forms competition, but a scoring
mix-up may have cost him a higher
ﬁnish in that event.

“The officials really screwed up
badly on all the scores,” Smith
explained, “and the Grand Master

- of the tournament came and kicked
out the judges and named new ones. _

But he didn’t start the competition
over; we kept out same scores.”

Nevertheless, Smith is proud of
his All-American attainment, es-
pecially since it came in the ﬁnals of
competition between thousands of
‘martial arts performers across the
country. V ,

Two of Smith’s LEA teammates,
Tony Lewis and Asa Knowles, also
qualiﬁed for the United States team
that will compete in the World
Tournament in Chicago this Sep-

 tember.

Smith is also headed for other

 competition. He will be a member of

 S.utch’s United Students team,

tourney there.

For his accomplishments in
California, Smith was awarded two

On
February 26, Smith received a local
honor as Bill Brice of the Tri-State
Karate Association, based in East -

"Liberty, named him f‘the out_stand- s

It didn’t matter to Smith how he
became All-America, whether in
football or martial arts. What counts
is that he made it and is not yet
through reaping the rewards.

Leaving a forwarding address
with the landlord will enable him to
return the deposit or the damage
list. If the landlord doesn’t respond
within 30 days, a former tenant has
the right to sue for double the
amount of the security deposit plus
interest.

Another area of the lease that can
cause conflict is the section
concerning repairs. The
should clearly state who is
responsible for repairs. Most often,
it is the landlord. The landlord can
enter your apartment and inspect
and make repairs at any reasonable
time he pleases, unless the lease
states otherwise.

If the lease states the landlord is
required to make the neededrepairs
on the apartment and he is reluctant
to carry out his part of the contract,
the lessee has two courses of action.

One course of action is to withhold

rent. This doesn’t mean the lessee
gets out_ of paying his rent——it .is,
rather, a system whereby the rent is
paid to an escrow account at a local
bank until the landlord makes the
necessary repairs. If, at the end of a
six-month period, the accomodation
is still unﬁt, the monev will _be
returned, minus any amount
withdrawn to pay for necessary
repairs.

4 The second method of having
repairs made involves the tenant’s
making the repairs and later
deducting the cost from his rent.
This tactic should only be used as a
last resort. And a tenant who uses
this method of getting the job done
should be sure to save all receipts.

For many students with a
year-to-year lease, it is important to
be able to sublet in the summer. If it

lease is to be ended or renewed.
Some leases renew themselves if
there is no notice of termination by
the lessor or lessee, so if you are
planning to move out at the end‘of
your lease it is a good idea to let the
landlord know. I

The shifty landlord trying to pull a
fast one may have some clauses in
the lease that won’t favor the tenant
very much and possibly, some that
are illegal. One of the illegal clauses

states that if rent isn’t paid on time ‘

the landlord can take any of the
tenant’s belongings.

Another clause to look out for is
the maintenance of premise clause,
which gives the tenant all
responsibility for maintaining the

_

apartment. This may include such
things as cleaning the cellar,
removal of snow or fixing the
plumbing, all at the tenant’s
expense.

A third clause you won’t want to
have in your lease releases the
lessor from any liability. The lease
may state something to the effect
that the landlord is not responsible
for any accidents or defective
facilities in the building even if it is
because of his negligence.

When the landlord-versus-tenant
battle starts to get juicy, the word
eviction pops up. A tenant with a
lease can be evicted for the slightest
violation of that lease. '

tenant either by a registered letter
or by placing a notice that is easily
viewed by the tenant of his order
from the court to evict.

An order from the magistrate
gives the tenant 10 days to reach an
agreement with the landlord or
move out. An order from the
Common Pleas Court gives the
tenant three days to do something.
The tenant can appeal to the court
from which the summons was
served if the two parties can’t come
to terms. If the tenant won’t budge,

the Sheriff will come out and move
all the tenant’s belongings to the
street.

If the landlord tries to, or does
boot someone out without an order

from the courts, it is illegal. If the
landlord threatens to change the
locks or shuts the utilities off, tell
him to go play on the _Parkway and
that he needs permission from the
court.

If the landlord fails to observe the
terms of agreement in the lease, or
wrongfully evicts, the tenant can
sue..

This should only be used as a very
last resort, for it takes a lot of time
and can cost a lot of money if the

tenant would lose the suit.

To get back less than $1 ,O00, go to
the Justice of the Peace; if

the disputed amount_is more than .

$1,000, sue in Common Pleas Court.

.   Rehearsal’: ReturnTo18th CenturyFrance

BY LEN ROMBERG

The Rehearsal
University of Pittsburgh Theatre
Directed by Kathleen George

“The Rehearsal?’ is a clever
play, ﬁlled with many peculiarities
and a few surprises. Taking a witty
script, the University of Pittsburgh
Theatre has staged a well
designed} superbly acted play.The
performance was quite impressive.

Jean Anouilh wrote the play
which takes place in 1951 but at an
18th century mansion. This play
within a play is about Tiger, the
Count, played by Daniel Frezza,
whose newly inherited mansion
becomes the scene for some
humorous but tragic events.

Tiger, whose life knows only
pleasure, is forced to turn part of
his mansion into an orphanage by
agreement. He decides to present
a surprise play during a costume
ball honoring the orphanage.

  

Make and

Genesis:

Clancy

The entire. stage action takes
place in a ﬁve-day period before
the ball. The action is an unusual
combination of rehearsals (the
characters have playscripts in their
hands) and normal dialogue.

Tiger gives himself and Lucille;
the governess of his orphans, the
lead roles in the performance.
Tiger doesn’t hide his love for
Lucille, even though his wife,

Eliane, is close by and aware. A
small incident leads to an evening of
friction and uncomfortable events.

From the start, the small cast is
in its elegant costumes of the 18th
century, complete with wigs for the
gentlemen. They soon not only act
their roles of 18th century
characters. but live and speak like

them as well.

From this viewpoint the acting
was excellent. During a scene
where ‘Tiger and Lucille are
rehearsing, Tiger has trouble
sticking with the script, showing a
greater interest in Lucille. His
wandering from the rehearsing

themselves to try and capture
acceptance in the United States,
something that had eluded them all
the way up until Gabriel’s
departure.

And if the response Genesis
received Thursday night at the Civic
Arena is any indication. they're well
on their way to becoming a
household word for progressive
music lovers, throughout America.

play or just talking.

Tiger. along with the other actors
and actresses, handled his role
commendably. Characters were
highly developed in this show.

‘Mimi O'Connor played Elaine, the

Countess, who is just a little upset
over her husband’s actions. David
Kuhns portrayed Hero, who is
sometimes sarcastic, sometimes
foolish. but always troubled and
attached to his bottle.

other problems, just doesn't get to

mistress, is portrayed by Nancy

Blum, a character who is also well .

polished.

As the story unwinds, more
scandals are revealed and more
games are played. The play builds
a myriad of situations that leave
one confused, at times trying to
catch up with the story.

Set design is another strong
aspect of “The Rehearsal.” Henry
Heymann’s set ‘contained an
abundance of furniture with a
golden paneled background, using
all available space. His giant
mansion room was stunning and
rich looking. reﬂecting upon the

class and elegance of the charac- 

ters involved. 4
Several small parts added up to

make the set shine. An “invisible”

door on one side of the room added
a surprise when it first opened.
The trees in the back yard, which
could be seen through the French
doors‘, also enhanced the scenery.
The set also proved mobile
enough to pull in a separate
bedroom scene through the.middle
of the main setting. Except for the
beginning of the third act, the large

~ room was used exclusively.

However, staring at the same
room was not monotonous or

a problem for the audience in this
show because the play moved rather

Pittsburgh City Players
Directed by Jewel Walker

William Inge’s “Bus Stop” was
offered to Pittsburghers this week
as the opening production of the
Pittsburgh City Players’ (CP) third
season at Allegheny Community
Theater. '

The play uses a common
vehicle—travelling‘ people being
unexpectedly stranded together for
several hours in a— small area—-but it
containslenough plot levels and
such a variety of interesting and

well-rounded characters that the
viewer becomes completely invol-
ved in the situations that unfold.

As the title suggests, the people ‘

in this story are travelling by bus
and are forced to stop for four or ﬁve
‘hours at a small restaurant during a
snow storm on their'way to Topeka,
Kansas. The backgrounds and

. personalities of the characters are

revealed to the audience one by one,
which means that several of the cast
are sitting or standing by idle while
attention is focused on different
persons in turn. _ .

Seeking the Irish Shores

BY SABRINA SIGAL

Bursting into song the moment
they appear on stage, their voices
come through the microphones
strong and clear. Liam Clancy asks,
'“Do we have any sound on these
bloody things at all?" The
audience laughs and claps to the
beat Tommy Makem strums out on
a guitar.

After a jolly round of “Real 01'
Mountain Dew,"
everyone that the French poet
Baudelaire wrote, “One should
always be drunk, that's all that
matters." ~

But Liam adds, “With wine, or
with poetry, or with virtue-—as you
choose."_ _

These two Irishmen. Clancy and

Liam reminds =

Makem, have been welcome. in
Pittsburgh many times before this
St. Patrick’s Day concert- Touring
Canada, Australia, the United
States and their native Ireland, they
sing the old anonymous songs and
ballads of their people, the poetry of
O’Casey, Yeats, Joyce and Behan,
and some that they write them-
selves. - '

They create a deep-felt rapport
with the audience. Wearing a
white cap and brown leather vest
and singing to the accompaniment
of a guitar, Clancy takes his
audience beyond the limits of the
ornate Carnegie Music Hall, out of

. the rainy Pittsburgh night, into an

emerald green ﬁeld where “With
the wind in the willows and the
birdsin the sky/ Weﬂve a bright run

to warm us wherever we lie.”

Clancy’s- eyes laugh. When he
raises his face toward the upper
balconies, his ruddy cheeks shine
and hegbounces and sways to the
rhythms.

By contrast, Makem—-with long
bushy sideburns and gentle wink-
ing eyes—stands. straight, one
shoulder forward, one foot stamp-
ing the beat. He switches from
guitar to banjo to recorder to
drum—whichever suits the song. '

He asks us if we know what a
“navvy" is. ‘Only a few in the
audience shout, "Yes." Disap-

Players Spend Time at a ’Bus Stop’p

{Continued from Page 10)
tempo that can result from this type
of situation, however, because it
seems natural enough in the
restaurant setting and because Inge
weaves the parts together delicately
enough to keep the plot moving
right along.

Characters include naive and
idealistic high-school waitress Elma
(played by Maureen Moore) and
older and wiser restaurant owner
Grace (Barbara Knowles). A local
sheriff is on hand, played by Ian
Schneiderman. The bus brings with
it a dance-hall singer (played by
Diane Heles) and her persistent
kidnapper-suitor—a21-year-old
cowboy who is accompanied by his
buddy. The bus driver‘ and a
thrice-divorced lecher complete the
cast.

Turning points occur within the
two-hour drama for all the
characters in ways that are
believable and uncontrived. The
only exception to change is the
sheriff, who remains pretty con-
stant throughout the plot. This role

is nonetheless a sizeable one and
he figures heavily in the situations
of the other people in the
restaurant.

Claude Purdy, a new CP member,

gave an outstanding performance
as the lecher, Dr. Lyman, a complex
man who is at once filled with
conﬁdence, self-hate and a sense of
failure. The part, which calls for
everything from drunkenmumblin g
to lucid philosophizing to ad-libbing
Shakespeare to falling asleep, is an
excellent opportunity for any actor
to display versatility, but it could

‘not have been utilizied so totally by

someone with lesser talents than
those of Purdy.

The lover-cowboy is played by S.
Dan Manning. While this role is not
as elastic as that of Lyman in mood
changes, it is dynamic and Manning
carried it off extremely well without
overreacting—something that’s
rare in “loudmouth” parts. His
transition into adulthood toward the
end of the play is convincing.

Other parts were equally well

done. Knowles’ Grace was low-key-

ed and natural. Naive Elma became
tedious at times, but Inge manages

to balance her part so well with’

Lyman’s that a touching moment of
clean and beautiful feeling evolves
between this unlikely duo.

The performance of “Bus Stop”
was directed by Camegie-Mellon
University drama professor Jewel
Walker. It is polished and
professional in every way, from the
characters to the costumes to the
set design and props. Only one
small ﬂaw marred the production-
a recording of “Black Magic” was
dubbed in for Heles’ singing, and
though she blended her voice
perfectly into and out of the record,
the recording was a little fuzzy and

‘obviously not her voice. Unfortu-

nately, it took away from her
performance slightly and the
audience laughed a little when they
shouldn’t have. ‘

Heles regained her ground,
however, with the resounding slap
she gave her cowboy-abductor for
interrupting hersong with cheers.

This is the turning point in their
relationship.

The serious themes of “Bus
Stop” are plesantly punctuated
with humor and the play is
decidedly light. The ending is
especially touching as audience
attention is suddenly focused on the
cowboy’s friend, Virgil (played by
Warren C. Bowles). '

Steve Pearson, who plays bus
driver Carl, is one of the original CP
members and is on the faculty of the
Pitt theater department. He will
direct CP’s next endeavor, “The
Fox” which is due to open this
Thursday and run for two weeks. it
is an adaptation of‘Ben Johnson’s
“Volpone.” '

According to CP director Mar-
jorie Walker, “Bus Stop” was

originally scheduled to open March "

3lbut was delayed because of the
illness of Elva Branson, who was to
play Elma. Walker said, however,
that the lost week may be made up
in about.a month—perhaps right
after “The Fox” ﬁnishes in two

weeks.

‘ Gymnasts Looking Up  

BY MARK MURPHY

Showing that their winning days are
still sometime in the future, the Pitt
women gymnasts finished seventh in the
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (AIAW) Eastern Regional
tournament, placing well behind
champion Clarion.

Improving only slightly on their eighth
seeding, the Pantherettes hurdled
seventh-seeded and archrival Slippery
Rock, _ narrowly edging the Lady
Rockets, 130.55-130.40. Clarion’s
winning total was 149.0 and runnerup
Penn State scored 147.50. A

“I thought the scoring was a little
low,” Pitt coach Donna DeMarino said.
“We started at 9:30 at night and the
judges had been judging since 1:00 in the
afternoon. I think if we would have
competed in the round before ours (with
Clarion and Penn State) we would have
been around 132 or l33.”

» Despite DeMarino’s claim of low
scoring, some of the Pantherettes turned
in more than respectable performances.
Pitt’s leading competitor was Regina
Carson who finished with an all-around
score of 33.60. The freshman from Belle
Vernon, Pa., also managed the

Pantherettes’ highest individual score of.
the night with an 8.8 in vaulting.

Following Carson’s lead was another
freshman, Alison Hoburg. The Alison
Park,‘-Pa., native compiled an all-around
score of 32.7, including a tally of 8.75 on
the uneven parallel bars. Despite the

The Pitt rifle team ended its 1976-77
season with a 10-4 record following a
decisive 1,284-1,267 victory Friday
evening at Geneva to boost the Panther
shooters into third place in the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Rifle
League (WPIRL) standings. ‘ -

The Pitt Riﬂe Club-sponsored team
was led by team captain Mike Heck, who
fired a 272 out of a possible perfect 300
score. Also, qualifying for the Panthers
were juniors Rob Yankes (262), Lloyd
Sayman (255), Steve Sisak [(254) and
senior Debbie Mitchell (241).

Facing a schedule which included

nationally-ranked West Virginia and

Youngstown State, the Panthers could

post only a 1-3 record in exhibition.

her proteges were shortchanged on many
of their routines.

“I don’t think there was enough of a
distinction between difficult
performances,” the third-year coach
complained. “The judges gave some

high scores in the round before us. They
were a little leery of giving high scores in
our round.

“In their own minds,‘ the judges

"thought theyhad seen the best teams

earlier and we were marked down,”
DeMarino continued. “When we are as
good as Clarion and Penn State we can

expect that, too. But until you are there
you have to expect a few knocks along
the way.”

Other Pantherettes turning in fine
routines were Cyndee Severyn with an
8.3 on the balance beam, Germaine
Zubritsky with an 8.25 in vaulting,
Diane Miller with an 8.1 in vaulting and
Kim Phelan and Kathy Spine who both
garnered personal bests in the day-long
tournament. DeMarino is quick to point
out that of the above team members,
only Severyn and Miller are non-

«freshmen, leaving the future of women’s '

gymnastics at Pitt very, very bright.

“With all these freshmen coming back
the future looks really good,” DeMarino
happily stated.‘ “Our recruiting is
coming along really well, also. Next year
we should be able to compete with both
Clarion and Penn State. We will not be
an easy meet for anyone next year."

If some of this year’s performances
are any indication of what Pitt
gymnastic fans can expect in the future,
the winning days could come soon, and
stay around for a long time.

s Pantherettes Run Like
The Dickens, End 1 1th  

I-IANQVER, N.H.—With apologies
to Charles Dickens, “Pitt had thebest of
times, Pitthad theworst of times...”

The Pantherette track team,
competing against 39 other schools in the
Eastern Association for Intercollegiate

Athletics for Women (EAIAW) indoor «
' championships,
overjoyed and disappointed with their.

were alternately

showings at Dartmouth College.

For the best of times, three Pittindoor
records were set and one tied as the team
finished 11th overall.
Lewis, Janice Irwin and Karen Krichko
won the Pantherettes’ highestiaward of
theday, bronze third-_place medals in the
880-yard relay. The foursome won the
first of two final heats by 45 yards in
1:47.58, a new school record. Earlier,
Irwin had surpassed her own Pitt record
in the 440 with a 60.7, eighth-best in the
competition. 1 ’

Also setting a new school standard
was Brenda Chorpenning, who bettered
her own 880 record by five seconds with
a 2:21.9 clocking. Tying Lewis’ 60-yard
hurdle mark was Michelle Bressant with
an 8.5 in her quarterfinal heat; she then
placed seventh overall.

As usual, the Pitt jumpers were fairly
successful. "Long jumper Shaw finished
fifth, while Marie Ribik and Krichko

’ tied Vickie Cosen of _Penn State and

Cathy Loisellé of Springfield, but were
awarded fifth- and sixth~places because

' of passes in the competition. ‘

Running their best mile relay-this year

were Irwin, Lewis, Maria Sciullo and"

Bressant who combined for. seventh
place. Taking eighth places were
Carmen Scherich (shot put), Lisa Sciullo
(long-jump) and Lewis (hurdles).

For the worst of times, the mile relay,
Scherich and Lisa Sciullo all failed to
make the finals by one place. Similarly
frustrated were Chorpenning,-Lewis and.
Bressant. Although they all had good

clockings. the EAIAW’s method -of
advancing contestants to finals kept

' these runners from making it into the top
Chorpenning, for example, was '

six.
third in her 880 heat, where only the top
two advanced to the finals, yet some trial
heats were faster than others. ' As a

result, several runners who advanced to '

the finals actually had slower times than

‘ Chorpenning.

The meet, however, was not without
its national-caliber performances. Long
Island Uni_versity’s Lorna Forde won, the

‘440 in 54.21, less than one second off

Roslyn Bryant"s indoor American
record. Morgan State’s mile relay,
which ‘had easily -won the Pitt
Invitational, again totally outclassed the
competition with a 3:49.6, only five
seconds off the American record. MSU
finished seven seconds ahead of runner-
up Maryland.-

Olympic high jumper Paula Girven of
Maryland captured her event at 5’l0”.

The final team scoring yielded
somewhat of an upset. Heavily-favored
Penn State was edged out by Maryland’s
Terrapins, 66-64, for the EAIAW title.

 In Recmiting Interest    

BY JIM LEWIS

Prejudice. It’s found in every phase of life. Sports is no exception.

While articles abound with tales of how one wide receiver who has caught more-
passes than colds has visited Pitt 12 different times, or how a basketball center from
Knobsville, Mississippi, who bumps his head against birds in ﬂight shook hands
with a Panther coach, minor sports coaches are busy at work trying to recruit top

players in their respective fields.

Not that football and basketball recruiting is unimportant, but minor sports
prospects—no matter how high caliber of athlete they are——are ignored by the press

and just about everyone else.

At Pitt the situation is no different. Everyone waits with baited breath for the list
of prospective. football finds or double-figure roundball shooters. But that's not the
case with the likes of soccer, gymnastics, swimming, wrestling or any other

quashed sport force—fed the label “minor.”

It’s sad, because minor sports coaches
work just as hard (if not harder) on
recruiting to keep their squads on the

same level of excellence. These coaches, ,

both men and women, have perhaps a
rougher time; they have less money to
wave in front of ‘top high school
prodigies as’ football and basketball

commanders—all they have to pursuade I

recruits is the University, the program,
the community. And if you think that

the niceness of a campus outtalks huge_

sums of money, you’re wrong.

 

_ was this athlete recruited...

So if you think that a football or basketball coach is living the “hard life” because
he is traveling all over the United States for top-notch players for the future, just
imagine what troubles minor sports coaches have in trying to get something for

nothing.
basketball recruits only.

Yet newspapers run stories on the names of the latest football and

By the way, how many_soccer recruits can you name?

Since lam the one who writes the majority of the wrestling articles, I might as well
throw my hat into the current grappler “controvcrsy" by generalizing my beliefs

and intentions as a journalist.

When I write an article, I strive for quality writing——not. excessive space. Who
cares how long an article is if it’s so bad the reader refuses to even finish it‘? Size does

not impress—quality does.

' ...as heavily as this one?

 

So, when the wrestling team
complains that the size of an article on
them appears smaller than that of other

sports, they may be right; I don’t try_

penning a sports page “War and
Peace.” '

It’s not that I hate the wrestling team;
I don't. But just like the Panther
grapplers I try to do something that
earns praise. I may fail, but that's the
objective behind my sportswriting.

If one of my articles, or any Pitt News
sportswriters’, appears shorter than the
involved c0ach’s estimation, it’s not
because we abhor thatparticular sport;
it's because we try to emphasize quality.

Saleski Tricks
Penguins, 4-0

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—Right
winger Don Saleski turned his first_
National Hockey League hat trick to
give the Philadelphia Flyers a 4-0 win
over the Pittsburgh Penguins last night.

Saleski’s first goal came on‘ a shot
from the right circle that hit a skate in
front of the net and trickled by Penguin
goalie Dennis Herron with just 1:20 left
in the first period. ‘

Bob Kelly made it 2-0 by sliding the
puck past a roving Herron at 10:03 of
the second period. Saleski blasted a 35--
footer into the net at 8:30 of the final
period before putting in his 20th of the
season on a 15-foot backhander at 15:48‘.

Linemate Orest Kindrachuk assisted _

on all three of Saleski’s goals and
Harvey Bennett assisted on two.

Goalie Wayne Stephenson faced 22
shots in recording his third shutout of
the season, including only one in the first
period. ' » «
