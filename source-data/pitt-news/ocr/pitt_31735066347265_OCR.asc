BAS Charges

SGB Ignores

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Black,Action Society (BAS)

- Co-chairman Doug Guy charged

yesterday the present Student

. ‘Government does not allow, stud-

as

U

ents any access or input into
decisions that affect students.

Guy said this was one of the
reasons behind last Wednesday
night's heated three-hour confron-
tation between BAS members and
members of the Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB). Over 150
members of the‘ BAS stormed an
SGB meeting holding SGB mem-
bers and Student Affairs personnel
hostage during the heated three-
hour protest.

‘ ‘Students aren’t apathetic, they
just don’t re pect the SGB as an

-9 effective vehicle for students to

communicate their concerns,” Guy
said, ‘ ‘What happened Wednesday
night is saying Student Government
is - not ‘a representative govem-
ment.”

‘ ‘Students are not apathetic, Guy
said, “They just don’t_ have any
vehicle to communicate the pres-
sures they face-to a representative
group.”

SGB President Barry Weisband,
however, maintains the current
system provides the framework to
allow students to become involved.

“The Board represents students
only when they want to represent
themselves,” Weisband said.
“The processes work if everyone
cooperates.” I

Weisband said yesterday the

BAS actions at the board meeting a

last Wednesday were “absurdity at
its highest.” He also said BAS
should have brought their demands
to the Board’s attention in a more
respectable fashion.

“The only thing shouting ac-I

complishes is hoarseness,” Weis-
band said.

Guy said BAS would have
brought its demands to the SGB in
accordance with Roberts Rules of
Orders if the board were truly
representative and’ responsive to
their needs.

The demands BAS presented to
the Board were included demands
the SGB begin to deal with political
situations such as racism in South
Africa, and the SGB take public
stances on issues such as a
non-commissioned police force, the
Pitt treatment of the community and
_Pitt’s treatment of students in the
residence halls. A I

In a statement released Thurs-
day,_ Weisband reported the SGB
will not consider demands that do

- not take the interests of the entire

student body into consideration.
The statement also said the Board
would not review demands accom-
panied by violent threats.

Weisband and SGB members
reported they felt their safety was
jeopardized during the meeting.
“Wednesday night was organized
chaos‘--and in that type of situation
there is the potential for violence,”
Weisband said.

Commuters Preparing
a For PAT Bus Strike

BY DEANNA LOUISE

While the county commis-
sioners hold a silver cruciﬁx to the
impending Port Authority Transit
(PAT) strike, JoAnn Levison,
Chairman of Student Govemment’s
Emergency Carpool Committee, is
“banking her bottom dollar” the
drivers will strike, creating a
commuting dilemna for some 18,
719 off-campus Pitt students.

5 The Dec.l strike would leave

most Pitt commuters abandoned
but not lonely, at bus stops as far

away as North Hills, where Levison »

lives.

Levison said carpooling costs no
more than her two-way bus ride to
Pitt, which totals $1.90 every day.

“Gas plus parking expenses,
with three people in each car
couldn’t amount to more than
that,” Levison said.

HAPPY THANKSGIVING

The Pitt News suspends publica-
tion for the Thanksgiving holidays
with this issue. The next issue will

’ be published Wednesday, Dec. 1.

About 50 commuters have
expressed interest in the carpool.
Levison said she expects many more
will ﬂood the Student Union Lobby
where the carpool station will be
located, in the event of a PAT strike.

Maps of Oakland parking lots will
be available at the carpool station.
Commuters can ‘ﬁle information
about their schedules and bus
routes and bus stops, and their
ability to provide a car at the station .
Carpool participants will be expect-
ed to share gas and parking
expenses, Levison said.

The committee will try to provide
last minute rides for commuters
who ﬁnd themselves in— a bind,
Levison added.

Levison said she sees working
conditions, security, and pay raises
as the three main points of
dissension in the Amalgamated
Transit Union contract between
PAT and Division 85.

Drivers now receive a minimum
hourly wage of $7.01 and average
more than $15,000 annually.

The Country Commissioners
have stressed during meetings in
the past several weeks that a pay

safety was in jeopardy during the
confrontation.

Guy also said the demonstration
and the nonviolent protest march
preceding the meeting were aimed
at bringing the heightening con-
cerns over treatment of blacks at the
university into the public view.

“We have a number one football
team, and the number one college
rusher in the coutry. We don’t want
to take away from the team, but it
creates a false impression of the
position of black students at the
University when Tony Dorsett’s
name is connected with the
University." ‘

Guy said the SGB members
should voluntarily resign, and
students representing various con-
stituencies on campus should meet
together to form a _‘ ‘different type of
decision making process.” Guy

~ said the new system should involve

an extensive system of polling to
insure that all students have an
opportunity to voice their opinions
on issues. According to Guy there
should also be open -forums for
students to discuss issues.

Sfudenf Needs   Sugar Bowl Official,  
  But Penn State Awaits

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

‘ ‘Regardless of our national ranking
and regardless of any bowl, we
won’t be able to reach our ultimate
goal if we don’t beat our last
opponent. ’ ’ --Words of wisdom from
Pitt Head Coach Johnny Majors.

Now, let's take a careful look at
that quote, /spoken by Majors
following last week’s unofficial
announcement, which was con-
firmed just after6 p.m. Saturday, of
Pitt’s invitation and acceptance to
play in the Sugar Bowl in New
Orleans against six-ranked Georgia
on New Year’s Day. ‘

THE NATIONAL RANKING:
Unless you’ve been searching for a
cotton swab at the North Pole, of
course, you know it’s number one.
But the distinction the Panthers
earned after the upset of previously
top-ranked Michigan several weeks‘
ago has dwindled--first, by the
Associated Press vote. last week

which put UCLA a close second,
and, now with Southern Cal’s easy
handling of the Bruins on Saturday
and Michigan's dominance of Ohio
State, it will again be close when
this week’s poll appears later today.

I‘m not going to stick my ﬁnger
up (with a number one gesture)
until the ﬁnal game, ” iMajors said.
“If we earn it then, I might do it one
time." I

THE BOWL: According to some
veteran partygoers, Bourbon Street
sure throws a great New Year’s Eve
celebration, but that won’t concern

Vaccine Leaves Faint Traces

BY MAGGIE McKAY

A few people felt, faint after‘
receiving their swine ﬂu innocula-
tion last week at Pitt’s Swine Flu
but none had serious
reactions from the shots according
to Karen Farber, organizer of the
clinic. ’

“Some people felt faint after-
wards, but more from the idea of
getting a shot than from anything
else,” Farber said.

Approximately 15 percent ”dr
6,000 members of the Pitt

community including faculty, staff ,
and students received swine ﬂu _:§
vaccines during last week’s three ii
day clinic. This ﬁgure is‘ better, :

Farber said, than the County
Health Department's seven per-
cent average priorto its last clinic
on November 14. '
Possible reactions to the vaccine,
according to the U.S. Public Health

Service, are redness and tender-’

ness at theinjection site, fever,‘
chills, nausea, loss of appetite,
muscle ache,’ joint pain, headache
or fatigue. These reactions are
usually short-lived, lasting less
than 48 hours.

Trained medical personnel from
the university supervised the
vaccines, . Farber said. Besides
employing many full time’person-
nel, the clinic utilized nurses from
the School of Nursing and the
University Health Center as well as
students from the School of
Pharmacy. Everyone who worked
at the clinic was paid for his
services, she added.

Prior to being vaccinated,

individuals had to sign a statement L

releasing the University and area
hospitals participating in the
innoculation drive from responsi-
bility for the vaccine’s effects. The
participants, "however, did retain
the - right to sue the U.S.
government in the event problem

did occur. --

“People made their own deci-
sions regarding the swine ‘ﬂu shot
given the data. People weighed the
pros and cons and some just said,
‘I don’t want to get the shot,’ ”

Hyner, along with Student
Health Center director Dr. Joanne
Robinson and the center’s staff
doctors were on hand at the clinic’s

answer questions about the swine
ﬂu. '

Vaccine Leaves Faint Traces

information about the ﬂu. The
doctors made recommendations to
people on whether or not to get the
shot if they thought they were
getting colds,” Hyner said.

The vaccine given at Pitt’s clinic,
Hyner emphasized, was the mono-
valent vaccine for those from ages
18 to 64. It is only for swine ﬂu. The
government is also distributing a
bivalent vaccine which isintended
to immunize against both the swine

‘»flu and the A/Victoria ﬂu. This

vaccine is given primarily to the
elderly and certain other high-risk
groups. The A/Victoria ﬂu is the
same variety of ﬂu experienced last
winter. Few Americans have been
innoculated against it.

The innoculation program held at

Pitt and many other area colleges is
party of the federal government's
crash program to innoculate as
many Americans as possible
against the swine ﬂu, a suspected
variant of the inﬂuenza virus that

killed hundreds of thousands of
people in the great pandemic of

1918-1919.

Authorities fear that while
Americans have been exposed to
other inﬂuenza strains, they do not
have the antibodies to fight the
swine ﬂu virus.‘

The swine ﬂu panic started last be effective against it. A mutation

Understanding

The Demonstration

As the furor over last week’s Black Action 50Ci‘3tY (BAS)
demonstration subsides, it is clear manypeople still don’t understand

what it all means.

Numerous people still view the protest as 150 black students greedily
asking for more special privileges, when they already have enough to
warrant the term “reverse discrimination.”

Others see the protest solely as an attack on the Student Government

Board (SGB).

As far as special privileges are concerned, that is not what the
majority of blacks want. Ultimately, most desire a day when the
special privileges are not needed. But as long as blacks remain
unemployed, due to lingering prejudice, they are poor; and the P001‘ 111
this country are sent to inferior elementary and high schools. ‘Because
of that injustice, there is a need for U-CEP programs ‘and other
“special” programs to give black students what they didn't have

access to before college.

As far asthe protest being directed solely atthe SGB; that isthe easy
way out. The truth is, all sharethevblame for the black students’
frustration-the student leaders, the administration, the faculty, this
newspaper, and the many students who still mutter racist jokes

‘ thinking no one hears.

’ It is unfortunate that the sevenxmembers of the SGBhavehadtobear

BAS Action Draws

UV\LU Supports  
Wed. Night

The Undergraduate Women’s
Union at Pitt supports the Black
Action Society’s demonstration
against the insensitivity of Student
Government Board to the needs of
students. We feel that SGB as
presently assembled doesn't ade-
quately represent the student
body, particularly blacks and
women. SGB fails to meet its’
duties as a student organization by
disregarding the needs of many
students. .

Therefore, we feel that BAS was

' justiﬁed in its unusual means of

expressing their dissatisfaction
with SGB. We are also dissatisfied
with SGB’s response to our needs.

Use Minds,
Not Fists

As a member of this university
community, I am disgusted at the
blatant arrogance of the Black
Action Society in dealing with the
presentation and orientation of
their grievances. I am equally
dismayed at the Pitt News for

justifynrg their -actions and’ beliefs: ~ *

Although there are many speciﬁc
views with which I disagree, it is
more important to look at the
broader, underlying philosophy.

As black students at this

university, you are part of an

academic community, not a politi-
cal bandstand from which dem-
ands, threats, and other authoritar-
ian motives are made into
‘ ‘immediate public actions. ’ ’

As black students of an academic
community, you must certainly be
concerned with individual rights of
everyone, not just a minority. Your
grievances show otherwise. The
grievances sight the fact that, ‘ ‘Pitt
is supported by each and every
taxpayer...”, but you demand that
this money should be under “full
control” of “those involved in the
recruitment of minority students.”
Would this be acceptable to the
community? No. It is an infring-
ment of the community's -rights, as
a whole, to have their money used
this way. It is wrong to the tax
paying community for, in your
words, “all (other) functions
oriented toward minority students
be given top priority by the Univ. of

Pittsburgh. ’ ’

A university has academic
priorities in the ﬁelds of chemistry,
physics, medicine, etc., suited to
help the whole community, as well
as the minorities. You believe that
your individual wants should be the
university's most important goals,
but you fail to realize that a
learning institution has much

higher - goals; . goals ...pcinte.d. .at. ..

disagree with the fact that civil

The epitome of your biased

It states, “Tuition hikes have hit

university must insure the right of
cultural uniqueness, and even
support this right through concrete
action, but it cannot allow one
group its egotistical whims. I feel
that a university should not be

feel strongly that the blacks should

Her baby was born September 6,
a 5 pound and 6 ounce, red-haired,
blue-eyed .... ..girl.

The father’s wife at first was “a
bit dubious,” but now she says
“she loves the baby like it was her

9!

IMPRESSIONS

 .-..1hey,yv_5;re

The baby’s mother took $7,000
for her labors, and the father said
he'd still like a son, but can’t afford
one right now. “I may try again,”
he said. _,

Though some readily point out
that the case is no more bizarre than
the reverse of artiﬁcial insemination
in a woman whose husband’s sperm
count is too low to cause conception,
there _is something here that smacks
of General Motors.

Assuming that artiﬁcial insemi-
nation of any type is moral (if indeed
it is), there is a stark difference
between the woman who conceives
and nourishes to birth a child that
will be her own and the woman who
goes through the motions of labor

like some Detroit assembly line,
receiving steel and rubber and glass
in December to turn out a red or a

blue Pinto in September. Taxes and ‘

destination charges, whitewalls,
pin—striping and other options
extra.

Now we have mail order babies

. like the mail order brides of a

century ago. “WANTED--Good-
looking, healthy Boston woman of
breeding to marry Dodge City
rancher and produce a tribe of

strapplin’ cowpokes. ’ ’

It could become a lucrative
second job for single, female office
workers. Imagine doubling your
yearly salary for a little nine-month
moonlighting. You could no doubt
collect your sick beneﬁts toward the
end, too. Maybe even set up a small
union, like the UAW.

And all to carry on some
chauvinist’s family name. May the
man have ten more artiﬁcially
inseminated daughters, and may
they all marry their maiden names
into obliteration.

CAE Supports BAS  
Against Student Gov't  

BY DEBORAH EIIRLICH

In response to the question in the

November 10th Pitt News,
“SCATH where are you?”, it
should be understood that SCATH
(Student Coalition Against Tuition
Hikes) was a student coalition
formed to ﬁght tuition hikes. A
coalition is various groups working
towards a common goal. The major
conflict which weakened SCATH
was the inability of certain student
groups to work collectively. The
Student Government Board (SGB)
saw its role, not as an equal
member of the coalition, but as its
leader, dictating what could and
would be done by the organization.
When this was not accepted by the
rest of the coalition, SGB left the
group and for the remainder of the
term spent moreenergy ﬁghting
}S‘_(ll‘ATH than the impending tuition
1 e.

Since the spring term (and even
earlier), the Black Action Society
(BAS) has tried to convey the needs
of Black students on campus. Once
again, SGB felt compelled to

. dictate whatethese needs should be.

‘Because of the SGB’s supportive
attitude toward administrative pol-
icies, students are not and do not
feel represented. If the representa-
tion were there, BAS would not
have had to force SGB to listen to
their demands in the manner which
occured last Wednesday.

Rather, SGB would have been
aware of most, if not.all of their
demands—-e.g. the problem with
housing, campus police, and the
curtailment of Black Studies
Programs. It may have been that
. . 9???? ;°If."i‘i‘i .P.“°"“‘-'““5

i ‘events is,

but chose to ignore them, by not
viewing them as high priorities of
problems faced by students. In
either case it is clear that SGB only
represents its own members,
rather than the entire student
body.

So where is SCATH? It is not
“haunting” SGB; that was never
its function or purpose. Its purpose
was to inform students of the
University's misdirected priorities
and then" try to change these
priorities. The CAE as a member of
SCATH, agrees with and still
upholds this purpose. CAE is now
expending energy educating and
informing the student body of
campus issues.

We support BAS, and all student
groups struggling to voice their
needs. As part of our support we

I!‘

0'!”

5}‘

distribute leaflets, letting students‘

know what is actually happening.
This is very important. Despite the
Pitt News’ claim to be objective and
nonbiased; their reporting of
in fact, biased and
misleading.

An example is their coverage of
the Wednesday night SGB meet-
ing. The Pitt News described the
actions of BAS as a “violent
threat” directed towards SGB,
when in fact no violence existed.
They continually ask why students
take no action on campus, but
always condemn all action as
wrong. *

CAE will continue helping
students see what the real issues
are, and will oppose the dictatorial
methods of SGB’s relationship with
students.

BAS History One Of Progress And Setbacks .

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The protest last week by the Black
Action Society (BAS) was only one
link in a chain of efforts to improve
conditions for black students at Pitt.
BAS was founded in 1968, a time
when Pitt’s black population
totalled 165 students (1.5 percent of
the total student body).

In May of 1968, BAS‘ presented a
list of demands to Chancellor
Wesley Posvar that provided for the
following: the Black Studies
Program, increased enrollment of
black‘ students (aiming for 20
percent of the student population)
and the -Afro-American research
center at Hillman library. They also
demanded that all news releases
and publicity affecting the campus’
black community be screened

A through BAS, and that the number

of black faculty members be
increased. I

Meanwhile, the Chancellor and a
small group of administrators who
were concerned about the lack of
minority enrollment, developed
“Project A” which later developed
into the current University-Com-
munity Educational Programs
(UCEP) program. Initially, Project
A was a plan to recruit approximat-
ely 50 minority students who would
enter the University in the fall as an
experimental basis (meaning that
many of the usual admissions
requirements would be waived.)

During the 1968-1969 term, BAS
expanded because of the increased
number of black students enrolled
under Project A, and their
recognition as a student group
representing blacks on campus
grew. BAS then became more
action oriented.

On Martin Luther King’s birth-
day, over 200 people, including

xstudents, members of the Black

Panthers, BAS, and Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) entered
the Chancellor’s ofﬁce to present a
series of demands. Posvar refused
to give in to what he referred to as
“pressure tactics” and eventually,
the group left. Later, however, they
occupied the computing center and

' negotiations between the Chancel-

lor and BAS quickly resumed.
Despite differing reports on the
take-over, the fact remains that no
equipment was damaged, and
Posvar signed an agreement with
the students which provided for the
May 1968 demands of BAS and for
no repercussions towards the
demonstrators.

UCEP expanded to include a
greater num_ber of students in a
series of three programs: the
Malcolm--Martin--Marcus Scholars
(Tri M), the Developmental Scho-
lars Program (DSP), and the New
Careers Education’ Program
(NCEP).

Currently, BAS is subdivided into
several committees including pro-
gramming, news information, and
public relations which includes the
BAS newspaper. It is a member of
the Black Activist Students Intercol-
legiate Statewide Organization
(BASICS). V

The BAS serves not only Pitt
students but also goes out into the
Oakland community and keeps in
contact with prisoners at Western
Penitentiary, according to BAS
member Carl Redwood.

But despite the changes BAS has
negotiated, setbacks will occur.
The Black Studies Program (which,
next to the Women’s Studies
program, receives the least funding
in the university) was hit hard; it has
lost eight faculty members.

“I really feel that we’ll have to
take the initiative, ” Redwood said.
“It’s just a general trend. Student
Government is still supposed to be

supporting us. There is some
(support) but notenough.”

A basic purpose of the BAS is to
preserve cultural identification for
students. This idea is embodied by
the Black Studies program.

“There are so many things when
you go through development that
you attack too many things at one
time,” said former BAS chairper-
son George Van Hook. “The
organization is trying to maintain
the enthusiasm and progress that is
part of the tradition that was set
eight years ago. We're looking at
an organization that is trying to
stabilize.”

“The organization hasn’t moved
too far from the original goals, ’ ’ Van
Hook said, “but it’s moved more
into dealing with the interests of the
students.”

Van Hook stressed the need for
continuity and “responsibility to
self and community.”

“It’s a matter of developing the
potential of these ideas to their
highest,” he said. “I think, getting

— back to observation, of having more

black students in the organization
has done a lot in accomplishing that.

Now, in the area of programi

development, I would evaluate
these efforts as being of moderate
success over all, but very successful
when you consider that it’s taken
eight years to develop the
program.”

Van Hook - feels that the
University was surprised by the
quality of the Black Studies
programs and that student enthu-
siasm did not slacken. Most of the
credit, he emphasizes, must go to
the high amount of student
feedback in the program.

“It’s a system of dialogue
between the faculty and students,”
Van Hook elaborated. “It’s a very
positive thing towards development
of better programs. I think that the

“Leftoverture” is the newest album from one of America’s
premier rock and roll bands. Kansas’ brand of progressive
rock has been honed to its sharpest and most musical on

“Leftoverture? and it’s sweeping the country on the heels of
Kansas’ intensive touring schedule and rave concert reviews.

programs that exist now are the
results of that kind of dialogue.”
“A distressing aspect would be
the amount of community impact
they’ve had,” he said. “They are
not satisﬁed with the type of
community impact we’ve had,
whether the community be in the
Hill District or Western Peniten-
tiary.” ,
.“I think we have to step up the
kinds of things we started," Van
Hook said. He lists recruitment as
the top priority, and the need for a

more active role with the adminis-
tration. Van Hook also pointed out
that things must work both ways.

A “When the students wanted the
programs, they didn’t foreseerthat
they would have so much responsi-
bility,” he recalled.

Clearly, BAS is not afraid to
tackle responsibility. Or activism.

“BAS has to concentrate on
programs that were formed and
move closer as students,” Van
Hook said. '

raise would necessitate ﬁnding
funds beyond these which were
appropriated to PAT this year.

The union is asking for about a 10
percent increase in the base wage,
plus complete cost-of-living protec-
tion and triple pay for holidays.

Levison said the drivers are also
concerned about improperly main-
tained equipment and additional
security for drivers.

Although the County Commis-
sioners are pushing for binding
arbitration,» both sides conceded
only to daily negotiations for a
quicker contract resolution.

V Levison said since the carpool

funded by the student activities fee,
this is the ﬁrst time ‘commuters

“It's a shame the Commuter

Association had to fold when it

did,” Levison said. “But they
couldn’t even get enough people to
elect ofﬁcers.”

The Commuter Association vol-
untarily dissolved this summer after
a controversial June election of
ofﬁcers.

“This committee will give
commuters a chance to show their
interest and get involved, ’ ’ Levison
said.

Arizona's First Album

Strikes Broad Range

BY TOM WASELESKI

Arizona, Arizona.

If this what the Arizona sun feels
like, I'm going.

You can do just about anything to
this album: disco, harmonize,
swoon, rock, remember.

Arizona is a new band with an
unusually broad range to sound.
They open with a couple of cuts
that appear to be a resurrection of
Sly Stone, but by the time they’re
through, you've heard good tracks
in the styles of Heart, Olivia
Newton-John, Steve Miller, and
Kool and the Gang. Strange
bedfellows, indeed.

The band has guts. How many
groups do you think would attempt
a remake of the heretofore
untouchable “Suite: Judy Blue
Eyes,” and on a ﬁrst album, too?
Rock suicide, that’s what it might
be for someone else.

Of course, they don’t do Crosby,
Stills, and Nash one better, but
then neither did Elton John put one
over on the Beatles with “Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds.” The idea
is not to copy, but to add a._ new
twist. ,

With a female lead, soul backup
‘vocals, and funkier beat, Arizona
explores a new possibility with the
tune that’spositively impressive for
a‘ new group. From the electric
guitars to the pounding percussion,
Judy’s not quite the same.

The rest of the album is
originally written, though.

“Dance If You Wanna Dance,”
“Have a Good Time,” and
“Johnny O” are tight soul teasers
written by Pat Murphy. All three

  
    
  

use full group vocals and have
deﬁnite pop ﬂavor.
Murphy doesn't want to get too

._ heavily into soul, or else he’d most
‘ likely make his stretch of the record

a little overbearing for the pop fans

_ that are eating up the rest of it.

Ken Ashby is Murphy’s disco
counterpart. writing good dance
stuff in the way of “Don’t It Feel
Good," “Sweet Fantasy,” and
“Take It Slow." Here, too,
Arizona captures the beat and
ﬂavor of the biggest music craze

_ since Liverpool made its contrib-

ution to the world.

And “Mary’s Waltz,” which
closes the album off, is sheerly
moving. Dobbins is seductive as
she sings the first verse a cappella,
eventually using only the piano for
accompaniment.

This soft, plaintive voice is about
as tender as music can get. But
then, they tell me that’s what the
evenings are like in this place
where the group got it’s name--
where thorny cacti mingle with cool
twilight shadows, like disco bed-
ding down with love ballads--Ariz-
ona.

Jackson Plays Circle Game

BY GREG EBERHARD

I think a lot of people will agree
that most things seem to go in
cycles...not just seasonal changes
but emotions, good-days/bad-days
feelings, in-one-ear-out-the-other
days, fail on a test-day and all the
other facets of our living day in day
out. -

Is there any reason we can’t
apply those cycles to art trends?
Say painting...cubism synthezises
to abstract and around we go
surrealism and data...now we have
a rebirth in structuralism.

How about political cycles? How
about musical cycles? There is a
rebirth in rooting one’s music in
oneself, I think. Jackson Browne
has rooted himself and has come
full circle back to himself.

The Pretender is the morose
story of life in America...not the
blood and guts of Vietnamese
napalm or Watts burning in the
summer heat. No. It is much sicker
than that. It is about shopping and
Madison Avenue; it is about vets
after the “joust.” as Tom Wolfe
now calls it; it is about the
nondescript fondling of human
minds and bodies we each perform;
it is about Jackson Browne.

Late For The Sky proved to be
the introspective album for all the
stars in the world." Its pity and
self-demeaning attitude help up
the person who sang the tender yet
shocking songs on the album.

For Everyman was a little of
everything about this man Jackson
Browne who wrote the hits
included on the album. We all had
heard and loved “Takin' it Easy"
and “Theses Days” by the other
famous stars; we didn’t know how
he saw those songs live.

Jackson Browne (otherwise
known as ‘Saturate Before Using’)
was a clear cut picture of Southern
California life—not the vision the
Eagles have perpetrated on us, but
the late and love, the peace and
war, the lovers and the killers. This
album ‘was us.

We have now reclaimed oursel-
ves...so has Jackson Browne. The
beattitudes of these days and their
follow up have swamped as with
too much positivism...we need the
life of the Pretender. “And when
the evenings rolls around each day,
I’ll go home and lay my body
down...". The Pretender is the
body who goes to work, comes
home, sips on a beer, puts his feet

Urban Designs Look at Life

BY MICHAEL COHEN
D-

Urbanites of all sorts should not
let the “Conﬂuences” architecture
exhibit go by unexplored.

The urban design projects
prescribe an appealing antidote to
a decaying fabric of social life,
without invoking comprehensive
political/ social reform.

If you remain in awe of,
frustrated by or just plain confused
as to man’s role in shaping his
environment, stroll through “Con-
ﬂuences.” Pessimism and futility
will be rescued by renewed faith
and man’s ability to pull together.

Divided into seven galleries, the
exhibit opens with a meager
display of folk architecture through
the use of photographs, models,
graphic arts and a slide show to

illuminate various Urban Design

', city is his most intricate social

projects.

Aesthetically, the architecture
doesn't overwhelm. But I laud
their egalitarian design process.

‘U.D.A. first approaches the affect-

ed residents in order to gain
personal input before any plans or
designs are initiated. A critical
path is drawn with various steps
outlining an agreed time frame.
Active citizen participation is
essential.

In modern architecture, it is
unusual to ﬁnd citizen participation
in the design of their environment.
The history of architecture is
replete with man-made environ-
ments as normal and traditional.
Culture, the physical environment,
materials and craftsmanship, and
personal aspirations all helped

achieve a particular urban form.
Man is a social animal and the

image. In a sense every city is a
living organism with a bodylike
structure.

“If a city’s streets and alleys are
sinews drawn tightly across con-
tours of the land, its parks may play
the equivalent of lungs and in its
plazas more than one heart.

In another sense a city is a series
of transitions: intricate conﬂuen-
ces of walkways and traffic lanes
expressing the daily routes and
spontaneous events of its citizens
and the relation of every man and
woman to the metropolis as a
whole, across the thresholds from
private to public places.”

“Conﬂuences” will remain on
display at the Frick Fine Arts
_B_gilding through December 5.

up on footstool-and later puts his
feet up on his wife...” And when
the morning light comes streaming
in, We’ll get up and do it again,
Get it up again, Amen...”.

This body that trudges through
the streets looking for a little bit of
himself and everything else in the
people on the street. But Jackson
Browne walking around has deeper
fountains of sorrow that this simple
pretender.

A series of five songs that seem
to fit together...all about “you"
make a darker picture than we
would like to think for this minstrel
of the.fountain of light. “The Only
Child” (about his son Ethan),
“Daddy's Tune" (about Jackson),
“Your Bright Baby Blues” “Linda
Paloma” and “Here Comes Those
Tears Again” are stories about a
depressed man...a man who is left
with a child after his loved one
leaves him. (Amen).

These ﬁve tunes do not concern
me now; it is the others that are
intriguing. Particularly the open-
ing tract entitled “The Fuse”.

It is a travel piece...not your
normal travel piece but a time-
travel piece. Using metaphors
closest to the musician “...Fall
away leaving only the sound of the
drum, life a part of me, It speaks to
the heart of me...” he draws time
into his comfort. But it is not
pleasant feeling I like “Time runs
like a fuse, and the fuse is burning,
and the earth is turning...".

The crumbing walls and raging
rivers, starvation and civilizations
dying gives us no hope. “The
.fuse’s last line gives us children
laughing. The laughing stops in the
“Sleep’s Dark and Silent Gate”. “I
don’t know what love has got to do
with happiness...” Why? Why do
we have to hear of all this doom
(the reviewer asks)? Don’t,hit me
again... the only thing that
makes me cry, Is the kindness in
my baby's eyes”. '

This album is a solid approach to
depression...it is sad...it is dark...it
has a picture of his kid running on
the beach with a poem of Pablo
Naruda...it is about you in ten
maybe ﬁve years from now. This
album is about this man: “I’m
going to be a happy idiot,
Struggling for the legal tender.
Where the ads take aim and lay
their claim, To the heart of the
spender...”

Indeed we have to “say a prayer
for the pretender” but I don’t think
it’s wrong or in bad taste to say a
prayer for Jackson or Ethan.

Top-Ranked Pitt In Tough Finale  

Panther booter Carson Long, who has scored more points than any
kicker in the history of major college football, is determined that this is
the year Pitt ﬁnally defeats the Penn State Nittany Lions. Wilson photo

(Continued from Page 1) '
Athletic Director Casimir Myslin-
ski, after unofﬁcial reports earlier in
the week had the pact already
made. -

‘‘It’s a great privilege and we’re
proud to be a part of it, ’ ’ Majors said
of what he termed a “great” bowl.
‘ ‘We’re delighted to go down there.
I was in the Sugar ‘Bowl years ago
and I know any young man would be
proud to take this bid.”

» THE ULTIMATE GOAL: Let’s
just say it's not the championship of
the Bottom Ten.

THE LAST OPPONENT: Un-
doubtedly, the Penn State Nittany

Lions, whom Pitt will meet
November 26, are the best 7-3
squad _in the country right now. A
whole bagfull of lapses cost Penn
State an upset of Ohio State earlier
in the season when the Nittany
Lions fell to a horrendous 1-3 start.
But six wins in a row later, the
football factory from Mt. Nittany
would like nothing better than to
knock off Pitt, a deed’ it has

Roundballers Ready L

For Dress

BY JOHN FEYDO

The Pitt basketball team will
raise the curtain on what promises
to be a very exciting season with an
exhibition game against the Ath-
letes  Action Challengers (AIA)
at Fitzgerald Field House tonight at
‘8 p.m.

The AIA squad is a touring group
of Christian athletes made up of
former college players, most
notable of whom is 6-4 guard Harry
Sheehy, who last season averaged
24.5 points per game while hitting
49% from the ﬁeld. Also a member
of the AIA team is ,former West
Virginia University star Bob
Hornstein.

The Pitt roundballers are chomp-
ing at the bit for their ﬁrst action
after five weeks of grueling
practice sessions, which have seen
no set starting ﬁve emerge.

“We probably won’t start the
same ﬁve guys from game to
game,” head coach Tim Grgurich
said. .

“We have ten or eleven fellows
who will share playing time this
year—we’re going to be very
ﬂexible.”

Although centers Ed Scheuer-
mann (ankle injury) and Kelvin
Smith (knee problems) aren’t 100

e per cent healthy, both should see

action in tonight's opener. Mean-
while, freshman swingman Sonny
Lewis is out of action for at least a
week, having sustained an ankle
injury in practice last week,
necessitating a cast on the ankle.

Everyone else is ready to go,
however, and sure to see action. A
probably starter at one forward
spot is 6-6 junior Larry Harris, last
year’s leading scorer (22.1 ppg)

Rehearsal

and an all-American candidate. At
the other forward look for 6-8
freshman strongman Mike Rice to
be crashing’ the boards along with
6-6 junior Wayne Talbot, also a
power-type performer.

At guard, where most of the

Panther depth seems to lie,.

Grgurich can choose among Pete
Strickland, a slick 6-0 sophomore
ball-handler and 5-10 sophomore
David Washington, who is noted
for his quickness.

Expected to see action as the‘

second guard or as swingmen are
6-3 junior Scott Nedrow», 6-2
sophomore Wayne Williams, and
6-1 senior captain Frank Boyd.
With speed and quickness on
their side, look for the Cats to be
running more on offense this year,
while on defense Pitt will continue
to employ the famed “amoeba” a
constantly changing combination
man-to-man and zone affair, which
is the brainchild of defensive coach
Fran Webster. Although this
defense can be hard to learn,
Grgurich claimed “The new boys
are working into the system real
well. I don’t anticipate any

' problems. ”

So,'as the Panthers set out to
improve last year’s disappointing
12-15 showing and regain the form
which led to 25-4 and 18-11 records
in the two previous campaigns,
they are keeping in mind their
goal——winning the newly formed
East Indies Conference, thus
earning a trip to the NCAA
Tournament.

FOUL SHOTS: A preliminary
game at 6:15 will feature the Pitt
Pantherettes, coached by Pat
Wallace, against Robert Morris in
women’s exhibition action.

tablesvare turned--it will be the

Panthers who will be favored going
into the Three Rivers Stadium test
(kickoff 9 p.m., televised nationally
on ABC-TV) and the Lions who will
be looking for an “upset.”

Yet, like the Pitt-West Virginia
game, records don’t mean a thing.
In a rivalry which dates back to 1893
(Penn State leads the series 37-35-3,
including wins in the last ten
games) anything could happen.

“I think the game would be rock
’em, sock ’em even if it were played
in some cow pasture between
Pittsburgh and State College,”
Majors said. “They (the Lions) are
probably the most improved team in

. the country and at this time, one of

the best in the nation. It will take an
outstanding effort on our part to win
the ballgame. ”

Notonly is the national champ-
ionship at stake, at least for the
Panthers, the ‘Lambert Trophy,
symbolic of Eastern football supre-
macy, will be up for grabs in the

. affair, which, last year, drew the

largest audience ever for an ABC
regular season telecast. The

Panthers have not captured the .

Lambert for over a decade.

“This should be an exciting game
for Eastern football and for
everyone watching it, ’ ’ Majors said.
“This rivalry between Pitt and
Penn State is of the. utmost

importance to the continued revival '

of Eastern football on the national
level.”

But what Majors is undoubtedly
putting before that is the continued
revival of Pitt football on the
national level. After leading the

Panthers to two bowl games in three
years (1973 Fiesta Bowl and 1975
Sun Bowl), Majors will be directing
Pitt in its first major bowl
appearance since 1955, when i the
Panthers lost to Georgia Tech in the
Sugar Bowl and in the Gator Bowl a
year later. Not only does Majors
want to win the Sugar Bowl this time
around, he wants to enter the game
withan 11-0 record, the finest ever
in Pitt football history.

And speaking of ﬁnest, tailback
Tony Dorsett, deemed by many to
be the ﬁnest runner ever to race
down _a football ﬁeld and the holder
ofvnine NCAA rushing records, will
be after an additional six marks in
the Panthers’ ﬁnal regular season
game. Dorsett needs only 157 yards
to surpass Ed Marinaro’s record of
1,881 yards gained in one season,
and 142 yards to become the ﬁrst
player ever to reach 6,000 yards.
The Panther senior, who will be
making his last appearance in
Pittsburgh as a collegiate player,

F

' will also be after records for the

most 100-yard games in a season
and career and three scoring
records. .

But the outcome of last season’s

Pitt"-Penin State slugfest has to be
high on the Panthers’ list of reasons
of why they would like to down the
Nittany Lions. The 7-6 heartbreaker
of 1975 may mean nothing now,

except for that certain element of '

revenge in the hearts of the Pitt
players.

The Panthers “deserved” to win,
but a 28-yard touchdown run by
tailback Steve Geise with less than

V seven minutes remaining gave the

Lions their one-point lead. Still Pitt
had a chance to pull out a victory,
but kicker Carson Long missed on
three field goals (what would be
considered chip shots for the
nation’s all-time leading scorer by
kicking) in the ﬁnal minutes,
including a 23-yard attempt with
seconds remaining.

  Spikers Fourth In East

BY JOHN FINN

The Pantherette Volleyball team
won’t be going to Nationals in
Austin, Texas this year.

Dreams of a possible national
championship were erased this
past weekend at Edinboro State
College when Pitt failed to ﬁnish in
the top at the regionals and qualify
for the Nationals.

But all was not lost as the young
spikers finished fourth in a
sixteen-team tournament.

‘Pitt begain impressively V on
Friday by defeating William
Patterson College and surprising
second-seeded Southern Connecti-
cut. Then the Pantherettes faced
Slippery Rock, a team with far less

‘talent than Pitt. The only trouble

was that no one told Slippery .«Rock,
and they upset Pitt two games to
one.

With a 2-1 record, Pitt qualiﬁed
for Saturday’s playoff and began by
defeating fourth-seeded Brockport,
3-15, 15-12, 15-13. But hopes for a
trip were obliterated by a powerful
Cortland team from New York, the
eventual runners-up in the tourna-
ment. Nontheless, the Pantherettes
made it close, losing 12-15 and
13-15.

In the playoff for third place, the
disheartened Pitt spikers lost to
Delaware and wound up fourth.

While Maryland and Cortland
represent the East at Nationals,
December 8-11, it will be more than

just “Wait ’til next year for Pitt.”
Many of the women will be staying
in shape and gaining more
experience by participating in
USVBA competition which begins
in December. S

PITT SPIKES: The tournament
was well run but the facilities left
something to be desired. McComb
Fieldhouse contained two beautiful
courts, but the third and fourth
courts were housed in an old gym
with a low ceiling. This caused
many of the players, coaches and
fans to ask ‘why another site with
better facilities wasn't chosen.

Pitt wasn’t well represented in
terms of fan support, however, but
those who did make the trip were
treated to angoutstanding display of
women’s volleyball. 1

Icers ’ Tom Gives Pitt Sher- Win, 1 1 -0

BY JIM PANE

Pitt’s “new look” hockey club
trounced a hapless Cleveland State
University.squad, 11-0, at the Civic
Arena Saturday without the ser-
vices of Captain Rick Vernon.

Vernon was suspended “indeﬁn-
itely” by Head Coach Len Barcalow L
after an‘incident with team coaches

 

following last Sunday's 8-8 tie with
Penn State.

Vernon's absence was hardly
missed as Tom Sherwin led the way
with ﬁve goals, and goalie Marty
Bradley made his initial start to
record Pitt’s first shutout of the
young season and boost the team
record to 2-0-1.

The scoring onslaught began
midway through the ﬁrst p riod

When the Panthrs pu or kick off, you can be sure that one man

will be around that ball when it comes down. Randy Reutershan has

Bowlers Strike,
Poison Colonials

BY JERRY VILLELLA

The Pitt bowling team turned in
its most solid, consistent perfor-
mance of the season by taking one
of three games and the total match
pins from Robert Morris College at
the Strand Lanes Saturday.

Shaking off a tough, 831-823. ﬁrst
game loss, the Panthers stormed to
an 854-786 second game victory,
highlighted by freshman Mark
Randall’s 221. With the two other
starting freshmen—-Mark Suekoff
and Steve Fendler——having good
series (505 and 512 respectively),
the team is conﬁdent of’ better
things to come in the second half of
the season.

It was the third game of the
match which demonstrated the
growing conﬁdence of the young
Pitt squad. The aroused Robert
Morris team came on strong, ﬁring
an early barrage of strikes in an
effort to blow the Panthers out.
Pitt, though, refused to be
intimidated and calmly put forth an
excellent game, building momen-
tum throughout and nearly winning
it in the ﬁnal frame. Robert Morris

ﬁnally won 879-853, but Pitt
maintained their lead in the
three-game pin total 2530-

- 2496.

Having completed half their
season, the bowlers will play four
of their remaining five matches on
the road.

Their next match, at Washington
and Jefferson on December 4 will
be a good test of the team’s
improvement, since W&J took two
of three games from Pitt last Oct.
23.

when defenseman Bob Arturo
whistled a slapshot from the right
face-off circle over Cleveland
goaltender Bruce Pajcic’s left
shoulder. Sherwin made it 2-0 with
his fourth goals of the season on
assists by linemates Bill Gedeon
and Larry Gallick, and a Rick Stein
slapshot ended the period's scoring
with 1:40 to go.

At 00:27 of the second period,
Curt Hetz, who is making a habit of
scoring withing the ﬁrst minute of a
period, punched home his ﬁfth goal
of the season. Two minutes later,
Sherwin’s short-handed goal to
make the score 5-0 forced Cleveland
to make a goalie switch, replacing
Pajcic with Bob Grundstein.

Grundstein couldn’t escape the
Sherwin hex, however, as the Pitt
left winger added three straight
goals to Grundstein’s goals against
average and eventually led to the
departure of the reserve netminder

the second period, and the third,

eighth of the year, came at 5:15 of
the ﬁnal period.

inued when Grundstein was rep-
laced by Tom Razka, who was
promptly introduced to a shot on
goal. It took only seven seconds for
Razka to look at a Gedeon shot that
found its way into the net. Gedeon
wasted little time again when he
scored his second goal within 48
seconds.

Barcalow, rating the Gallick-Ged-
eon-Sherwin line against the
combination of Hetz, Jeff Saunders,
and Gary Fries, said they’re so close
that the line on the ice at the time is
the ﬁrst line. “They work like

chime clocks,” he said, “They’re
always ringing the bell.”
Defenseman Russ Stump rang

the last bell of the game with his
ﬁrst goal of the year at 13:57 on
assists by Sherwin and Gallick.

“Like I always say," Bacalow
said after the game, “This is a
class team and their skating today
proved it. We've made some
changes, we have some discipline
now, a new morale, and a new
look.”

PANTHERS PUCKS: Pitt’s next
home game, December 12th, will be
part of a hockey double header at
theCivic Arena. The Panthers will
take on the Philadelphia Jr. Flyers
at 1:30 p.m. followed by a contest
between Duquesne University and
