Panthers
ready to
tip off

by Adam Littman
Se/zior Staﬁ’ Writer

Neither the Pitt men’s nor
women’s basketball team is sat-
isﬁed. Both went to the NCAA
Tournament last year, but each is
ready to start a new season and
improve upon successful years
that ultimately ended in disap-
pointrnent.

“We thought -we were going
to the Final Four,” said women’s
coach Agnus Berenato yesterday
at basketball media day. “We were
crushed when we lost to Stanford
[in the Sweet 16]. I told my crew
to pack for two weeks.”

It was the best‘ showing in
school history for the women’s
team, improving from the year
before, when the Panthers made
their first ‘Tournament appear-
ance, losing in the second round
to eventual champion Tennessee.

Pitt hopes to change a few
things this year, mainly its tempo.
Berenato said the team expects to
push the ball on offense and use
its depth at the guard position to
imp_rove the defense as well.

“The thing we’ll add this year
that’s different from past years is
we will be a full-court pressing
team,” said Berenato.

Also helping make the team
quicker will be the return of point
guard Jania Sims, who started 13
games for Pitt last year before be-
ing forced to sit out because of
academic ineligibility.

“I was happy they made it as
far as they did,” said Sims. “But
now that I’m back, we’ve got to
make it further.”

Coming into the season, the

Panthers havebeen either left out

of most preseason rankings or
included at the tail end of them.
“We just want other teams to
know that Pitt is still here,” said
senior guard and All-American
candidate Shavonte Zellous. “I

Pitt ceremony celebrates new W0

by Jayson Myers

Staﬂ Writer

Pitt celebrated the opening of
its World History Center yester-
day in the Frick Fine Arts Audi-
torium.

Set within the Department of
History, the World History Center
is dedicated to research, teaching
and international collaboration
on analysis of the global past,
with the intention of affecting fu-
ture global policies and practices,
according to a news release.

“Our biggest project is going
to be a world history databank,”
said Patrick Manning, an Andrew
W. Mellon professor of world
history at Pitt and the center’s di-
rector. This database will provide

information on a variety of sub-
jects from around the world.
Manning said having the cen-
ter will allow the Department of
History to add an undergraduate
survey course in world history.
Marcus Rediker, the chairper-
son of the Department of Histo-
ry, said changes will also be made
to the graduate history program.
Rediker, the celebration’s mas-
ter of ceremonies, said the cen-
ter is part of a trend happening
around the globe and that it will
help make more sense of national
stories. With the creation of the
World History Center, Rediker
said, “We’re now ahead of the
game. This is a very far-sighted
thing for‘ Pitt to have done.” .

“Someone, I believe it was
Voltaire, said that history is a pack
of tricks we play on dead people,”
said Rediker. “I’ve actually taken
the opposite view in that I believe
history is what we learn so that
people don’t play tricks on us. It
is crucial to be playing an active
role in modern society.”

How history comes into'exis-
tence, Rediker said, is a difﬁcult
question to answer.

“It depends on how people
in'the past look back on it,” said
Rediker. “We emphasize different
things.”

It» is especially important to
take the global approach, Redik-
er said, “because human beings
impose all kinds of divisions on

Economic crisis has Various effects

/Hi/29 over matter for cawb wow La wa oz éleaaing an? a came

by Mary Hancock
Stzzﬁ’ Wrder

The stock market is plummeting, peo-
ple are losing their jobs, and companies are
going bankrupt left and right. But don’t
worry.

While 91 million Americans individually
invested in stocks and 50.3 percent of all
households in the United States had some
sort of stock ownership, according to the
2005 census, fretting can only make things
worse, said Pitt psychology professor An-
drew Koffmann.

“We need to reassess our relationship
with money,” said Koffmann.

‘ “It’s important not to panic,” said Koff-
mann, who also directs the School of Arts
and Sciences’ Clinical Psychology Center.
“People can ﬁnd themselves feeling anx-
ious for many reasons right now.”

In addition to making the economic
situation worse, getting too upset about it
could be damaging to one’s health, he said.

_ According to Koffmann, citizens should
avoid letting anxious feelings take over their

lives and instead become more educated on-

what is truly going on in the economy.

“For students, this is an opportunity to
get back to the fundamentals of money
management,” he said.

Koffman said that the crisis shouldn’t
give anyone an excuse to neglect regular
habits and routines. Good habits should
continue, such as healthy eating, exercising
and sleeping regularly.

He also warned Americans not to eat
or drink in excess because of econornic-
related reservations. Nervous Americans
may be enticed touse other stimulants to
feel better, such as drugs or tobacco. Ner-
vous habits like these are detrimental and
might lead to bigger health problems in the
future, said Koffmann.» '

Pitt marketing and ﬁnance major Chad
Jaggard said that people can look to the
past for a solution.

“The only way to get out of this is’to
spend money,” he said. ‘‘I’m worried about

_ the economy in some aspects, but it should

work itself out. It has in the past, and it will

in the future.”
jaggard said he hasn’t changed his

While some regulatory laws might have
caused the economyfs current state of crisis,
other laws have been keeping it aﬂoat, a Pitt
professor says. A

“We have a_ long way to go before we
reach another Great Depression,” said Pitt
business law professor Douglas M. Branson.
“During the Great Depression, more than
35 percent of people were out of work af-
ter the market crash, as compared to today,
where only about 6 percent of people are
out of wor .”

Branson said that today’s monetary sys-
tems give the government a better chance
to intervene and that the Federal Reserve

_is more ﬁrmly established today than it was

during the Great Depression.

At the same time, Branson said he be-
lieves that today’s' crisis ' occurred because
American law gave companies too much le-
verage. Businesses have borrowed too much
money and then not been able to pull them-
selves out of debt. ,

“We are trying to get back in the middle

of accounting manipulation and accounting
conservatism,” said Branson.

Accounting manipulation occurs, Bran-
son said, when companies take measures
that make it look like their costs seem lower.
They therefore have more money to do busi-
ness with.

Companies that are economically con-
servative, however, tend to not depend on
money until it’s sitting in their bank account.

Washington to the rescue

The government reacted to the crisis by
proposing large-scale interventions. The
Bush administration proposed, and Con-
gress eventually passed, a $700'billion plan
that uses taxpayers’ money to bail out Wall
Street by buying bad mortgages from ﬁnan-
cial institutions. ' "

This week, the Bush administration an- 4
nounced that it would use at least 3525i) bil- ,

lion to buy shares in failing banks.
Both plans have been controversial.

“What caused‘ the main concern over [the -

plan] was the way the money could be
spent,” said Haider Ala Hamoudi, an associ-

Columniot

 

Sean Hannity’s pronouncement that
journalism died during this year’s presi-
dential election might be the only bit of

A truth uttered on a major news network in

the last 20 months: If you are not con-
vinced that this is true, consider the bla-
tantly unbalanced and petty coverage that
has beset the McCain—Palin campaign this
week, and contrast it with the media’s
treatment of the alleged Voter registra-
tion fraud perpetrated by the Association
of Community Organizations for Reform
Now, a group that Sen. Barack Obama has
been connected with since the 1990s.

A front page article in The New York
Times on Oct. 11 reported that “Gov._Sar-
ah Palin abused the powers of her office
by pressuring subordinates to try to get
her former brother-in-law, a state trooper,
ﬁred, an investigation by the Alaska Legis-
lature has concluded.” . R

The controversy that precipitated this
investigation centers on Palin’s ﬁring of

Alaska’s former public‘ safety commis— _

sioner Walt Monegan. It was not the law-
ful dismissal of the public safety com-
missioner that was unethical, but rather
the actions of Palin’s husband Todd and

other subordinates who pressured state

employees working under Mohegan to lay
down ‘harsher punishments on the state
trooper whose conduct was in question.
However, the undue inﬂuence of her hus-
band and staffers failed in extending the
punishment of the state trooper, making
the whole investigation seem frivolous to
begin with. .

When considered alongside the attacks
on Palin’s pregnant daughter and the left’s
derision of Alaska, which apparently is
not cosmopolitan enough of a ‘state to
produce a politician worthy to work in
the White House, it is not surprising that
amedia outlet like the Times would exag-
gerate such ﬂimsy charges regarding the
mere suspension of a state trooper.

Contrast the distorted coverage of a
trivial investigation regarding Palin with
the allegations of voter registration fraud
that have been brought against ACORN
in several key election states this past
week. ACORN, a nongovernmental orga-
nization that targets low-income people to
affect political outcomes, has supposedly
turned in fraudulent voter registration

 
 

cards by the thousands in counties across
the United States.

National Review’s Stanley Kurtz has
unveiled troves of Obama’s links to
ACORN that date back to when Obama
was a so-called “community organizer”
in the South Si'de of Chicago. In his May
29 article “InsideiObama’s Acorn,” Kurtz
shows how Obama not only represented
this radical association of community
organizers in 1995 as a lawyer, but also
trained ACORN staffers who went on to
both enlist thousands of low-income vot-
ers for elections and lead political demon-
strations in the Chicago area. 9

Unfortunately, people are only now
delving into this story, which broke in

»‘ Kurtz’s May article, with less than three

weeks left before the _election. Just as
Obama’s more than 20-year member-
ship in a radical church congregation and
his political partnership with Pentagon
bomber and Weathermen terrorist Bill Ay-

. ers have receded to the background as the

media continue to fawn over the Obama
mystique; his connection to ACORN will
likely fall to the wayside in a similarfash-

100..

The disparity in coverage of these two If

recent stories illustrates the unreliability of
the news media in the hyper—inforrnation
age that'we live in. Voters trying to get
an honest interpretation of the news can
only expect the hyperbolic coverage exem_—
pliﬁed by the so-called Palin Troopergate
scandal on the one hand, and the outright

' repression of the truth seen in the Rev.

Wright, Bill Ayers and ACORN coverage
of Obama on the other. ’

Why have the media refused to elab-
orate on Obama’s sketchy work for a
radical organization like ACORN while
continuously blowing out of proportion
stories about Palin’s record as governor?

The answer is obvious: The fair and un-.

biased investigative journalism that might
have existed in previous campaigns is
most certainly dead in this election year,
as commentator Hannity has reiterated in
past weeks. It speaks for itself when the
outrage portrayed on the front page of
the Times over the five—day suspension of
an Alaskan state trooper is placed on par
with Obama’s ties to an organization like
ACORN —_ an organization that espouses
ideals that are diametrically opposed to
those of the American Founders.

Whether‘ comforting or terrifying, chances are
that everyone remembers puppets in their child-
hood. if it wasn't through Saturday morning televi-
sion, it was through ventriloquists at camivals and
birthday parties or giggle-inducing shadow pup-
pets shown in elementary school.

But in Pittsburgh, puppets are more than just
child’s play. . T

Avant-garde puppetry comes to the city for
the 10th Annual Black Sheep Puppet Festival this
month, and with more than 25 events, includ-
ing performances, films, workshops and lectures,
there is something for everyone, no matter what
their puppeteering past ,

The Black Sheep Puppet Festival is the country’s
longest festival for marionettes, shadow puppets
and everything in between.

Like puppets themselves, the world of puppetry
festivals is a small one.

Mike Cuccaro, the managing director of the
Black Sheep Puppet Festival, and a group of his
friends associated with the Brew House witnessed
various puppet exhibitions across the county, and
they were intrigued. -

“This is really different, we -should try to do this in
Pittsburgh,” said Cuccaro. '

Even though the festival will include some hand
and shadow puppets, the Black Sheep is known
for combining and skewing many fomts of pup-

- petry in nontraditional ways. Several puppeteers

will put on cantastoria puppet shows, a style of
puppetry that drops the “fourth wall,” a theatrical
conceit that usually exists between the performers
and audience. Additionally, toy theater puppeﬂy,
a puppet art form from the Victorian era in which
immobile objects are attached to sticks and ani-
mated, will be big in this years festival.

“We’ve never done this much,” said Cuccaro.

Along with the performances and lectures, two
events are of particular interest. Handmade Pup-
pet Dreams, a collection of puppet films put to-

gether by Heather Henson, the daughter of Jim

Henson, will be shown from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. atthe
Melwood Screening Room in North Oakland on
Sunday, with the help of Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

The 24-Hour Puppet Reality Experiment perfor-

mance is a new venture at the festival, too. Taking
place tonight from 7 to 1 O at the Brew House, three
teams of five puppeteers each perfonn shows that
they created from scratch in me 24 hours before-
hand. .

Now a decade old, the festival has gotten bigger
each time around. This year brings local, national
and international puppeteers to the South Side.

Puppeteer Laura Heit, who hails from  An- '

geles, will display her uniquely named Matchbox

worlds and are attached with glue to matchsticks.

Even though she's been doing this cabaret
Matchbox Show for nine years, Heit has been add-
ing new shows to the lineup since.

This year, she brings a Matchbox Show to the
festival with a circus theme for kids.

“All of the little acts are circus acts, and they all
come out of a little matchbox train, a circus train.”

Heit does all the voices and sounds of the char-
acters, and while the display is tiny, the perfor-
mance is projected live onto a giant screen behind
her. i ‘

‘‘I’m playing with scale.
You see me on stage per-
forming these little, tiny
shows, but then you see
my hands and the pup-
pets huge behind me. My
thumb can be 3 feet tall,”
she said. "

Beyond scale, Heit said
thatbecause she playswith
small toys and puppets,
it brings about a sense of
play in the audience.

Tavia La Follette, a local perfonner and the

that gets its name from the tradition of one of the

 

.puppeteers from Germany making his own bread

“Puppetry has been commenting on society

without political tensions, though.

“You have someone who wants to protest
against the king. They can't hire messengers to
send out a royal proclamation everywhere, but
they can get some cloth and a stick and go stand
in the market square and put on a little puppet
show about how the taxes are unfair.” ,

So if taxes are too high, roads are too poor, or
wars are too deadly, hither come the puppet

“W.” isn’t about President George‘
W Bush, the man we know as our current
president. It’s about the idea of this man
—-— the spirit, not the details. Like a paint-
by-numbers completed using the wrong
colors, the film is a creative and surprising
interpretation, if not always an accurate
one. A ,

Unfortunately, speculation can lend
itself to exaggeration, and Oliver Stone
sometimes gets carried away.- Bush’s mo-
ments of divine inﬂuence, his tearful col-
lapse during a morning jog, his various
public humiliations — these scenes cer-
tainly make him a sympathetic character,

The great success of the film, and
Josh Brolin especially, is portraying Bush
as a likeable but mediocre man. After eight
years of public mockery and declining
approval ratings, remembering that Bush
wasn’t born president can be difficult. But
he was 54 when he moved into the
White House, and his assumption
of power was inﬂuenced by a life-
time of personal and professional

nonlinear structure.

Bush yearns for the approval of
his father but ﬁnds solace in the at-

However well you know the story, though,
the film’s agenda is open to interpretation.
Seeing Bush’s good intentions, as well as
his mistakes, will make you feel sorry either
for him or for us. After his Christian re-
birth, he transforms from being a simple,
confrontational alcoholic to a simple, in-
nocent child. His foibles and foolish be-
havior would be endearing if the repercus-

sions weren’t so ‘serious. When he drapes

Is it fair? Well, that’s relative. Corn-

Shelf the Uggs this fall for new boot styles

Boots, page 17
ing selection of boots, including all colors, heel
heights, materials, shapes and styles Even choos-
ing which category to browse first on the Web
site proves difﬁcult; Whats the difference be-
tween City Fashion, Sport Fashion, Dress Fash-
ion, Dress Classics, Career Classics and Casual
Classics? I have no idea. But I do know that I love
what I see when I click on each one

Channel your inner ’90s child and throw
on “Mumpower” boots, a Doc Martens—esque
ankle high—laced style selling in Carmel or black.
Pair with a grunge-perfect plaid ﬂannel or 
ﬂoral print dress, and you’re ready to walk out the
door ‘

The “Flokezi” boot  do they get these
names?) is the quintessential “hippie—chic bootie,”
as the Web site describes it The suede flat boot

 a moccasin is outﬁtted with  V

and metallic studding to keep it stylish.

Turn heads in “Tamisha,” a high-heeled,
knee-high boot in the must—have color of the
season: purple

For everydaywear, nothing beats “Cassella,” a
Hat leather boot that you can ﬁnd in dark brown,
camel or black. The description reads “urban
chic meets comfort,”  that you can run
to class while still looking fabulous in this slouchy
boot with an almond-shaped toe

Park Mall are the places to go for these shoe sen-
sations

Now this may seem a little silly, considering
that I’m giving alternatives to Classic Ugg boots,
but the reality is[thatUgg Australia does have ah.
er stylish substitutes to its overdone basic boot.

Exposed sheepskin, tich leather and a bold
buckle all make “Langley” a necessity. These tall
boots zip up the back for easy accessibility and
come in either black or brown to match every
outﬁt.

The “Totten” style evokes a more masculine,
equestrian feel,  that even the girliest
of outﬁts stay grounded Leather and suede-in
brown on black or black on black are stitched to-
gether to create a unique boot that you can trot all
over town wearing

Don’t think just because “Raya” has a high-
heel that this style isn’t oomfy— a sheepskin foot
bed ensures that your tootsies have a luxurious
place to stay the clay. Suede, leather, two metal
buckles and sheepskin trim ﬁnish off this stylish

boot ,

The “Caroline” style, featuiing a strap that
buckles around the shaft of the boot and supple
black or  colored leather, make this high-
heeled boot a deﬁnite fashion favorite of mine A
sheepskin foot bed is an added extra to an already;
stellar shoe,

I’m not  up my Classic Uggs anytime
soon, and I wouldn’t advise you to, either — they
are just too warm! But a girls got to have options

Navy defense giving up yards

Football, page 22

“I think it’s very difficult [to stop
them on offense],” said Wannstedt
“You have to be a lot more 
because they understand the option
and they are highly disciplined and ef-
ficient at executing”

“Theyfve got it all It’s triple option.
It’s load option.  run the lead play
with the quarterback following them
up They'll run the trap option that gets
you  one way, come back the oth-

"The guy is a playmaker,” said
Wannstedt. “I-Ie’s averygood athlete I

last year.

While Pitt’s defense currently -

ranks 27th, the Panthers’ running de-
fense  drops to 40th,  up
more than 115 yards pergame on the
ground

The good news for the Panthers is
that Navy has been less than exception-
al on the defensive side of the ball this
year,  85th in the nation (384.17
yards pergame).

in a monster effort, with 165 
yards on 32 carries and three touch-
downs in the Panther loss

Wannstedt gave credit to his offen-
sive line, in addition no McCoy, for the
improvement in the  game

for McCoy’s success Pitt  backs

“I think it’s a combination of all
