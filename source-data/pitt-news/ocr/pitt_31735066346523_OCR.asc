STUDENTS OF FRATERNITY'

Big Business Keeps

Sammies Sleepless

By JACKI KATZ and HM HUFNAGEL

Goldﬁsh—swallowing, phone booth-stuffing and even bed-
pushing are entirely passe now that the University chapter
of Sigma Alpha Mu has launched its Monopoly marathon.

The marathon, which began last Monday, had its origin
Eddie Leeds, Howard Finkel,’
Allen Paulenoff and Sherman Fogel. Before too long the
game became between rather thanO

in a “friendly” game among

among when the four players
merged into two teams — an un-
precedented bit of ﬁnancial strat-
egy.

By dawn of Tuesday morning,
the brothers decided that perhaps
a new record was in the offing and
turned their pawns over to pledge
substitutes. Fraternity ﬁnanciers
had been passing “go” round the
clock for well over 80 hours when
the Pitt News went to press-
with no sign of victory for either
team. .

Complications arose, however,
on Wednesday evening when the
brothers “broke the bank.” A
call to the president of Parker
Brothers, originators of t h e
game, elicited the reply, “Im-
possible. No one has ever brok-
en the bank. But the game must
go on so I’ll send you one mil-
lion dollars immediately -— one
million monopoly dollars, that
Is.”

The brothers came to the game’s
rescue and loaned money (inter-
est-free) to the bank until the
new supply of currency could
arrive.

By this time the air-express
shipment of money arrived Thurs-
day night, the shrewd Sammies
had broken the bank again. Be-
fore it was replenished the bank

To Highlight
Holiday Dance

Band ‘Will Handle
All Requests,’ MC
Chairman Promises

Final arrangements for this
year's All University Christmas
Dance have been announced by
Charles Lucas, general chairman
of the Christmas Dance Commit-
tee of Men’s Council. ”

‘‘This will be a Christmas Dance
that will surpass. your wildest
imaginations,” commented Lucas,
"it will be held Friday from 9
p.m. to midnight in the Cathedral
Commons Room.”

Music for the dance will be
provided by Ernie Bastin and
his orchestra. This group is well
known on the University of
West Virginia campus and is
composed of 14 members in-
cluding a male vocalist.

“The dance committee heard

. dozens of tapes from many or-

chestras trying to decide on a
band that appeal to University
students, and we know that we
have a hit with this group. They
will play your favorite songs and
will handle all requests,” said
Lucas.

“If you have been looking
for an opportunity to go to a
swinging affair, this will be it.
All students are urged to buy
their tickets early so as to avoid
the last minute rush."

Tickets for the dance will cost
$2.75 and will be on sale at the
Student Union Desk, the Student
Desk in the Cathedral, the Stu-
dent Desk in Scaife Hall, in the

tion $30,000 and their opponents
$20,000..

Local newspapers and radio
and television stations accom-
panied fraternity members to
the airport to record the historic
arrival of the brothers’ badly
needed funds.

The marathon has an academic

A special ticket booth will also
be set up in the SU main lobby
starting Wednesday.

The dance this year will be

morrow at 3 p.m. in the Alldred
Room, 609 CL.

Dr. Crouch. an instructor of

and holds AB. and M..A. degrees
from the University and a Ph.D.
from Princeton.

Except for time spent at

All cﬂmzernment Leivels Represented

Careers Conference Opens Friday

Representatives from agencies in all levels of
government will present an all Government Ca-
reers Conference in the Student Union Friday and
Saturday for interested. students. Federal repre-
sentatives will represent individual ﬁelds of en-
deavor as well as their agencies.

A kick-off dinner at 6:30 p.m. Friday in the SU
cafeteria will begin with a welcome by Wendell
Shoeffer from the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs. Dr. Stephen Ryder, regional
director of the U.S. Civil Service, will be the prin-
cipal speaker.

His topic, opportunities for the “generalist” in
government careers, ﬁts in well with the confer-
ence’s main objective —— career counseling.

Faculty members will attend orientation

meetings before the counseling sessions take
- place. Usually, students who are most desirable
as employees are placed through the personal

efforts of faculty members, according to Dr.

 

 

Walter M. Ritenour, director of the placement
service at the University. and executive director
of the conference.

He emphasized that immediate employment for
students who decide upon government service is
not necessarily urged over graduate study, that
each case must be considered separately.

Visiting student and faculty members will stay
at the Professional Center. Some of the schools that

have accepted the invitation extended to the tri-

state area are, from Pennsylvania: Gannon College,
Erie; Duquesne University, Pittsburgh; Carnegie
Tech, Pittsburgh; Grove City College, Grove City;
Allegheny College, Meadville; and Waynesburg
College.

From Ohio are: Marietta College, Marietta;
College of Stubenville, Stubenville; and ‘Youngs-
town University, Youngstown. About II more
schools are expected to attend.

Program
Humorist

By JUDY MEISLIK

Humorist and social satirist Ogden Nash will be featur-
ed at the ﬁnal Midday Series program of the trimester
Wednesday at noon in the Student Union Ballroom.

Nash, who attributes his career to “the sudden and sub-
conscious idea of writing bad verse deliberately,” has written
for the New York and the Saturday Evening Post maga-
'9zines as well as a dozen books of

poetry.

After leaving Harvard after one
year Nash went to New York and,
as he put it, attempted to “make
my fortune as a bond salesman
and in two years sold one bond—
to my godmother."

V ‘Doubledayed’

Leaving this failure behind him
Nash went on to more failures in
advertising and in‘ the publishing
business.

In 1925 he joined the adver-
tising department of the Double-
day Publishing House where he
“doubledayed until the begin-
ning of 1931.”

While working at this job Nash

began to develop his particular F

brand of humorous verse as he
doodled at his desk. The first
Nashism which he will acknowl-
edge concerns the scene in which
he finds himself: “I sit in an ofli,c:*e
at 244 Madison Avenue and soy
to myself ‘You have a responsi-
ble job. havenue?"

Except for a tenure as managing
editor of “The New Yorker” in
1931 Nash has been producing his
distinctive light verses at a prodi-
gious rate.

Twists Words
His first book of light verses
“Hard Lines" published in 1931
showed his technique of starting
with fabulously twisted words and
working them into an idea or
starting with an idea and letting
the tortured words fall into place.
His second book “I’m A
Stranger Here Myself” published
in 1936 was a best seller
throughout the world. Nash has
also written “Good Intentions,”
“Many Long Years Ago,” “The
Face Is Familiar,” and the lyrics
of “One Touch of Venus" with
S. J. Perelman.

In 1950 Columbia commissioned
Nash to write a verse accompani-
ment to Saint-Saens “The Carni.
val of Animals” which became a
best selling recording.

In addition to his writing Nash

“Masquerade Party" and to tour

Men’s Council Expresses
‘Discontent’ With Book Policies

By MATT SWETONIC

Members of Men’s Council re-
cently expressed their discontent.
at the manner in which the Uni-
versity Book Store has handled
the buying and selling of used
books.

This discussion xv-as brought up
during the Councils consideration
of transferring operation of the
Student Book Exchange from Stu-
dent Government to MC.

Jay Fingerot. the present head
of the Book Exchange, told the
Council that at a meeting on Sept.
27, Paul R. Boltacz, general man-
ager of the Book Store, explained
to SG that used books in good
condition were bought back from
the students at 50 per cent of their
original cost and resold at 75 per

cent of that price.
Never in Good Shape
Members of the council im-
mediately complained that al-

though this may be the policy of
the Book Store, it is not carried
out in practice.

“You never get 50 per cent
for a book,” remarked Charles
Lucas. “For a book that was
still being used in the Univer-

sity they gave me two dollars
which was far from being half
price.”

"They never find a book in good
c o n d i t i o n," complained Jay
Strunk. “but they still charge
their 75 per cent.”

Boltacz Complains

Fingeret attempted to defend
the Book Store’s policy. “They
won’t give 50 per cent if the
book is not going to be used in
any courses,” he said. However
many members of the Council
cited the example of the fresh-
man English text for which the
Book Store offered 50 uzznts at the
end of last trimester.

Fingeret also commented that
Boltacz complained to him say-
ing that “the Book Exchange
is helping to further the idea
that the Book Store is gyping
the students.” _

In response to this, Steve John-
son, president of Men’s Council,
remarked that if the Council de-
cides to take over the Exchange
their “idea will not be to cut the
book store’s throat but to help the
students."

WI1yN0t Go vernment?

With the“ fourth annual Federal Careers Conference

opening this week, students should seriously consider the
A opportunities it offers. A

Each year graduating seniors face the same problems
of job—ﬁnding,. and each year unemployment ﬁgures are
quoted and requoted to emphasize the employment scarcity
in the United States. But the federal government continues
to employ two and a half million people with challenging
and satisfying careers. Many of these are far above the
clerical positions so shunned by University graduates.

For graduates with a Liberal Arts background in area
studies and‘ language programs, for example, opportunities
with an international or intercultural dimension are avail-
able. In addition, in the past five years the amount of red
tape required to secure such a position has been cut to a
considerable extent. _

But jobs are by no means limited to these students.
Those educated in the professions, the physical, natural,
and social sciences or engineering are eligible.

Too often students have bypassed this area for what
they considered more lucrative positions. But the fact re-
mains that a top student in any ﬁeld can start with an at-
tractive salary, and advance according to this ability, and
it should be remembered that top notch men are needed
to enable the federal government to better meet its over-
seaslcommitments in the future. ,

In addition, a prospective government employee norm-
ally ‘has two paths from which to choose to acquire special-
ized knowledge. He may enroll in a graduate professional
school or he may enter public service immediately following
graduation. Schools such as the GraduateSchool of Public
and International Affairs on campus can give the specialized
education advantageous for the position.

But evenif he does enter public service immediately
following his bachelor’s degree, a graduate can ‘continue
hi: formal educatiqn with the government assuming whole
or part of expenses.-

The above is only a brief sketch of the opportunities
possible in the federal service. With. such a background in
mind it might be wise for those students, seniors‘or not,
who are yet undecided what their future work will be, to
take advantage of the two day conference this weekend. It
is just one example of the job being done by the University
Placement Servicein an effort to defeat the job scarcity
which seems to grow worse with each graduating class.

Pressure On Professors . . .

 

  . Publishor Perish

Bl lna Aimdur

One would like to think that the academic
world was free of the life-killing mottoes of Madi-
son Avenue. The values of the social and business
world which are reﬂected in thepadvertising of the
nation should have no place in the “groves of
world

academe.” Unfortunately, the academic
seems to have succumbed to the
malaise of the societywhich it
is its function to criticize. The
pernicious academic motto “pub-
lish or perish” reveals the goals
for which some members of the
academic community have de-
cided to strive. ’

For those who are not ac-
quainted with the meaning of
this motto, a short explanation is
necessary. The professor is ad-
vised that either he publishes
books or articles, or he does not advance as a pro-
fessor either in position or salary. Unfortunately
this doctrine expresses some confusion on the part

“of its authors as to the function of a college pro-

fessor. The research which a professor does is

‘neither a necessary nor a sufficient prerequisite

for good teaching. _

Every student knows that the value which the
academic world places upon professional publica-
tions is a great hindrance to the professor who

wishes to be an inspiring teacher. Teaching, in the»

best sense of the word, is the personal after-class

communication between teacher and student. But

this kind of teaching, takes time. Many hours each

_.week which could be spent on research are spent

in talking to students. The professor who does not
talk to students andwho is not seriously concern-

‘ ed about their progress does not deserve the title

which has been given to him. He may be a scholar,
but he is certainly not a teacher.
Easy Remedy .

The colleges could easily remedy the dilemma
of the professor. They could begin to devise a sys-

 

tem whereby the professor who is a conscientious
teacher and an inspiring lecturer receives some
kind of acclaim which would also entitle him to a
higher position and a raise in salary. Admittedly
this system would be hard to originate because of
the difficulty of determining the quality of_a pro-
fessor’s teaching and the extent of his interest in
students. However, if some more equitable system
is not devised for the rating of professors, the aca-
demic world will have demonstrated that it, in
imitation of the business world, places no value on
the intangible and cares only about the produc-
tion rates of its members.

The only people ’truly competent enough to
judge the teaching ability of, a professor are his
students. The scholarly journals cannot; the dean
cannot; his colleagues cannot. There are “‘certain
gesturee of the spirit” whichvan inspiring professor
makes to his students that leads them to believe
that they are in the presence of greatness. Those
gestures of the spirit are revealed when the pro-
fessor shows his disciples a way of looking at the
world which they have never seen before,.or when
he removes for a moment the blinders of laziness,
blindness, and prejudice in order to show the stu.
dents a vision of the world as he sees it, a commit-
ment to the truth as he knows it. And for a
moment the student and the professor have ‘met
and have experienced the true meaning of human
communication.

Rarely Happens

It happens rarely, because the blinders of the
students and the indifference of the professors
make theexperience an infrequent one. But if any-
one is to be rewarded, it is precisely that professor
who 1 causes this experienceto happen, either in
class or out of it, perhaps at the expense of his
personal aggrandizement and scholarly prestige.

Greatness in a teacher is just as diﬂicult to ﬁnd
as greatness in any man. But it is certain that the
academic community is paving.the way to its own
self—destruction if it does not begin to emphasize
teaching and to de—emphasize publishing.

Student Raps Le"r’rer
From Penn State Girl

Editor, The Pitt News,

Ever since Jim O’Brien wrote
his first
against the football team, I have

article -of criticism

sat back and watched the critical

letters stream in.
I had wantedto write and de-
fend your able sports editor and

finally, decided to do so when I
read the illogical and incorrect
letter from a Penn State co-ed,
Mary Higgins, concerning the
O’Brien articles.

In Miss Higgins’ letter and in

most of the others, the chief.

complaint was that Mr. O’Brien
singled out one player for criti-

-cism. This seemed to be a mortal

Sln.

What I want to knowis where
have all these defenders of fair
play been when Mr. O’Brien
praised a member of the football
team, as he did so frequently
this season?

Not a word was said about the
articles praising the football
players even though this con-
stitutes the same thing that ev-
complaining‘ about:
placing the doings of the team
at the feet of one “player.

Miss Higgins further states
that Mr. O’Brien is trying to
shield coach Michelosen. Any-
one who read “It Goes On” on
November 29 realized the folly
of this statement.

One last detail of Miss Hig-
gin‘s letter must be clariﬁed. She
spoke of Mr. O‘Brien’s remarks
concerning Mike Ditka. The re-
marks about Ditka were quotes
from a player and not from the
writer.

It is about time someone re-

' it

cognizes the ﬁne columns that

Jim O’Brien is turning out and

give credit where credit is due.

Alumnus Adds Defense

For O'Brien's_ Columns

Editor, The Pitt News;

As a recent alumnus of the
University of Pittsburgh, I have’
‘maintained an interest in the
school partly through reading
The Pitt News. V P

Lately, I have read a number
of letters harshly criticizing
sports editor Jim O’Brien for his
views as expressed in his col-
umns. V

I feel it is time to disagree

with these letter writers and

write a few words of praise for
Mr. O’Brien, which he justly de-
serves.

Mr. O’Brien’s columns, rather.
than being out of place and‘

1aCkiY1g in “good taste and fair
play,” are refreshing, learned
and just plain excellent. Perhaps
it is a sad commentary ‘on If the
ability of his professional col-
leagues, but Mr. O’Brien’s writ-
ings at this time are better and
more itrteresting than those of
any sports writer on Pittsburgh’s
two daily papers.

Perhaps‘ Mr. O’Brien’s views
are contrary to those of many
of his readers. To my knowledge,
this is a sign of success. Many
great writers have expressed
great satisfaction at having the
ability to arouse the readers’ in-

 terest to the point that one seg-

ment of them agrees" with the
writer while the other segment
disagrees.

The students of the University
of Pittsburgh and all of the

readers of the studpnt p ap er

  

should express great satisfaction
that they are’ able to open the
paper twice a week and read the

work of such an excellent
writer.

SC President Urged
To Follow Own Plan

Editor, The Pitt News,

Congratulations are in order to
Richard Sobota for his most
thought—provoking and dynamic
proposal to re—organize Student
Government.

I ﬁnd much merit in his sug-
gestion that certain members of
the Student Government should
“remove themselves from office”
(The Pitt News, 11/29/61).

After being virtually ‘inspired
by the self-realization of Mr. So-
bota, my only suggestion as an
interested member of student life
and progress is that he can ex-
emplify himself as the “true”

, student leader by being the first

to follow through with his pro-
posal.

No Classes Scheduled For Former Library

Unique Syria-Lebanon Room

Brought Intact from Old World

By JIM NELSON
The Syria-Lebanon Room
is the most "unique of all the

Nationality classrooms be-
cause it is the only one
brought’. intact. from the old
World. It is also the only Na-
tionality Room in which there are
no student classes.

The room, oi'i:_4_:nally the library
of a wealthy citizen, was salvaged
by a Syrian antique dealer from
one of the homes In Damascus
during the construction of a mod-
ern highway through the ancie.11t
city.

Each section or‘ paneling was
taken apart, reinforced, number-
ed. and crated for transportation
over the high mountains of Leba-
non and the Atlantic Ocean to the
Fifty-seventh Street. Art Gallery
in New York City.

Shows Two Cultures

The Syria - Lebanon Room
shows the interchange between
Oriental and European art forms.
The room's individualistic and
distinctive style is km)w.n as “Dan-
mascus Style."

Gesso paint ornaments the
walls and cabinet doors. A mix-
ture of chalk and glue, gesso. is
a creamy substance applied to in
wood surface with a brush. In a
few hours the gcsso dries out to
a fine smooth white surface
which can be easily ‘and effec-
tively covered with any kind of
paint or gold leaf.

lt was customary to paint reli-
gious pictures on the wood panels
covered with this thin gesso base.

The wall opposite the entrance
door houses the Mihrab, a recess-
ed prayer niche with a stalactite
vault lacquered in gold. The
Mihrab in a mosque corresponds
to the altar in a church.

Contained Library

Small cabinets flank the Mihrab
on each side. On the side walls
the panels have been designed to
emphasize open recesses in which
art objects were displayed and to
emphasize the large closed cabinet
which housed the main collection
of books.

The ﬂoor of the Syria-Leba-
non Room is laid with blocks
of white marble. In front of the
Mihrab the white marble is in-
laid with a geometric pattern
in red. marble. This is the spot
on which the devout Mohamme-
dan unrolls his prayer rug for
his daily devotions. I

Built-in divans, or sofas. ex-
tend along two sides of the room
from wall to wall. The low marble
foundations support mattresses
which, although "twelve inches
thick, are not soft.

An old mosque lamp of per-.

forated copper hangs from the
stalactite in the center of the ceil-
ing. Originally the green glass
drops from this light gave a soft
light from the wicks ﬂoating in
oil. This seems to be the only
thing in the room which has been
cl'..angc»:l with a modern invention
-—electr‘icity.

By BARRY GROSS

A conlidence man is roaming the
Pittsburgh area, posing as a rep-
resentative oi‘ foreign student or-
ganizations, and taking money
from gullible people.

Miss Rene l..lCl’ll6l'l..\‘l(:‘ll'l, Univer-
sity adviser to foreign students.
said that last week at least two

people gave money to a man whoi

calls himself.’ Raul Garibay.
M0T1d‘c1}’ he appeared at the Car-

told the secretar_v there that he
was a representative or the New-

money for a conceit and dinner;
the Club was supposedly holding?

to honor foreign students.
Secretary gave him $14.
Appears Annually
Last Wednesday at the Evan-
gilan Residence. at home for for-
eign students, he reserved six
rooms for students he said would
be in the city for the United We
Sing Program. He posed as a rep-
resentative of the l‘nternat.ional
Club of Pittsburgh.
At the Evangilan Home, he
collected seven dollars from a

Four years‘ ago he told Miss
Lichtenstein that he was a rep-
resentative of the Mexican Con-

found that he had been asking

Julius Caesar is one of the
earliest of Shakespeare’s plays. It
was originally performed on an
open stage, and the players have
tried to preserve a feeling of
space with a forestalge constructed
in the orchestra pit and a set
composed of many steps and
rnultiple levels.

According to Dr. Ralph Allen,
director, a fluid production style
is being used with no interruption

‘het\A:'een scenes. The play, origin-
ally divided into ﬁve acts, has
been reduced to three.

Advance sale for the play has
been good, according to Gil
Lazier, publicity man for ‘the pro-
duction. “Wednesday evening and
Thursday afternoon and evening
are almost completely sold out,
with heavy advance sales for the
other days.” Tickets are on sale
at the Student Desk, CL, at Scaife
Hall and at the bookstore. Price
of admission is $1.50.

The technical ‘part of the show
has been directed by Phili, Eek,
a newcomer to the University this
year.

Commenting on future plans,
Dr. Allen said that as many styles
of productions as possible will be
produced over each four year
period.

 

JOCK BEACHLER, freshman pre-med student,
easily won top prize of $100 in the third Viceroy

OSU Seeking
New Wiiining
Streak At Pitt

Student Ducats Available
For Feature Attraction;

Reduced Rate Offered
If the student ticket sales

for the forthcoming Ohio
State basketball game at the

Civic Auditorium on VVednes-
day night are indicative of the

enthusiasm that has been gen-
rated by the student body for the
1961-62 hoop campaign, the squad
members had better get used to
‘playing before friends and family
members at the Field House.
Both Carnegie Tech and Du-
quesne, the two schools which
meet in the other segment of the
double—header program, have sold
out their allotment of tickets. In
fact, some of the ducats originally
assigned to Pitt were transferred
across Forbes Avenue where they
were promptly purchased.
There are still tickets available,
however, at the Student Desk for
. $2.00. Th feaured games are well
worth the discount price, and the
proceeds are being turned over
to the Scoreboard Children’s Hos-
pital Fund.
Price Is Steal
The price of admission is a
“steal” when the magical name of
Jerry Lucas appears on the mar-
quee. Lucas, of course, can be
discussed only in superlatives, and
his Buckeye teammates are just
" as All-American as the 6-8 senior
himself.

The nucleus of Coach Fred
Taylor’s crew is formed by Lu-
cas, 6-5 John Havlicek and 6-2
Mel Nowell-—-all seniors, who are

playing their fourth season to-
g'ether..a.

They are augmented by some
big, talented sophomores who
range from 6-3 to 6-8 and the
Buckeyes could be even stronger
than they have been during the
last two years. These big’ sophs
could mean a lot more rest for
Lucas, who was plainlytired as
last season wore to a close.

Had Big Skein

All the Buckeye regulars had
reason to be weary. They carried
a 27-game winning" streak (plus

, five from the previous season) into

the NCAA against an aggressive,
tenacious Cincinnati defense.
The game went into overtime

before the Buckeyes bowed,
70-65. The nature of such a
score becomes all the more

meaningful when you consider

that for the 28-games season

Ohio State averaged 85.1 ppg

to rank fifth in the nation.

Among its other accomplish-
ments, Ohio State led the nation
in shooting with 49.8 per cent, was
second in free throws with 75.3
per cent and sixth in rebounding.
As far as oiTensive—del'ensive bal-
ance was concerned, the Buck-
eyes averaged 19.4 ppg more than
the opposition——-the second best
mark in that department.

No matter where you look, you
can’t spot a weak chink in the
Buckeye armor. They are strong
favorites for their third straight
Big Ten title. That should make
them slight favorites to beat Pitt.

especially when your target is All-

They found out why the betting

the home club some advantage
points. They understood what
Coach Bob Timmons meant when
he told reporters before the game,
“Well we’ll give Dischinger his 25
points, and hope to hold the rest
of their men down.”

Charity Helps

“Give” was an appropriate
verbal description, as the gaunt
Boilermaker capitalized on 13 of
18 “charity tosses” to enhance his
total output to 31 for the night.

Still, Brian Gereralovich, Dave
Sauer, Paul Krieger and Calvin.
Sheﬂ"ie1d—-the prime sophomores
-learned that Dischinger’ is
truly a bona-ﬁde All-America,
even if the officials are light-
ning fast to protect him from
mayhem.

Purdue Coach Ray Eddy, who
still shudders when he recalls last
year’s 81-80 loss to Pitt after his
team had rolled up an apparent
insurmountable lead of 22 points
in thesecond half, founc out
something, too —— “Pitt is gonna
be a line basketball team this
year.”

“In my opinion," Eddy remark-
ed, “this is a better club than the
one that beat us last year. I
thought that they were a ‘little too
aggressive (Purdue had 48 free
throw chances to Pitt’s 23), but
they have a ﬁne oﬁensive forma-
tion, and they're hard to stop.

Eddy cited the play of the
Panthers’ sophomores as being
particularly impressive. “But
there were so doggone many
fouls that you can’t really tell
how good they are. They swish
that net pretty well though.”

On Dischinger he said: “We
didn’t set him up as we should

that you almost foul him every
time.”

Cleans “Dish”

The gent who had the task of
guarding Dischinger, carrot-crest-
ed Paul Krieger, the gangling new
center of the Cats, did a com-
mendable job. He grabbed nine
rebounds in the ﬁI‘St half, and
blocked three of “Dish’s” shots
after the star had made his faking
moves around the pivot.

Generalovich, the muscular
miracle of Farrel fame, whom.
the crowd told to “get your
pads on” wrestled the ball loose
from many a Boilermaker, be-
fore he was called for “pushing

off uder the boards” for the
fifth time.
The Panthers outrebounded

Captain Tom Maloney had a few
baskets nulliﬁed by the refs, but
he salvaged 14 to lead his mates.
Sheffield and Sauer each scored
13 points, the latter hitting on six
of ten shots.

Co-Captain Bob Sankey, a sen-
ior who was bothered by aysiege
of “sophomoritis” in the first half,
clicked in the second canto for 11
points. Ben Jinks added eight to
the count.

In all, the Cats accounted for
one more ﬁeld goal than the win-
ners, but 34 free throws are too
much.

Brown TopSqashmen

Led by returning veterans Joe Brown and Dave
O’Loughlin, the Panther squash team is hopeful of improv-

ing last year’s 2-2 mark. Brown and’O’Loughlin are both
Juniors and went undefeated in Pitt’s all too brief squash
schedule last season.

Head Coach Ben Pope is also

Many Reserves Behind Starters

Mat Squad Deep

’Being a second string wrestler is not a happy lot. The
reserve grapplers rarely get a chance to perform in a meet,
but must ‘go through the rigors of daily practice like the

regulars do.

Despite the seeming insigniﬁcance attached to the sub

as was pointed out by the
wrestling team.

Last season Coach Rex Peery
had to get along with only three
reserves, 123-pounder Harry Dick,
l30—pounder Dave Osmun and
157-pounder Paul Wilson.

b Not Many Subs

The spare number of reserves
was pointed up on many occa-
sions. In the Lehigh match Peery
had to insert Jim Harrison in the
191 pound class, which is 24
pounds above Harrison’s level. In
the Penn State meet Wilson
wrestled 34 pounds above his nor-
mal weight. In both cases the
Panthers were defeated.

The situation was so bad last
year that Peery never had a
natural 177 pounder. Two 157
poundeis, Augie Arrigone and
Bill Robb shared the heavier
assignment.

This season depth should be no
problem for the matmen. It will
be especially pointed out if Sopho-
more Tim Gay earns the starting
berth at 157 pounds. In that case

two lettermen, Arrigone and Robb

will be on the bench and ready
for use in case of injury.

The soccer season otlicially l All~Ame3.‘iezm honors.

as the Pitt soccermen downed
their traditional rivals Penn
State, 1-0. Bob “Corky” Cuth-

With the lh'1a.l win, the l?’am:h-

mark. 'l.‘his record is an excep-

recognition.
Speaking: elf this year‘s team,

C.'.oach. Leo Bemls "had this to say:
