‘nonplussed by 'luck’

“Hello. Could you tell me what number your birthdate pulled in the
1973 lottery calendar and your reaction to your draft number?“

“‘I'm,Feb. 19—that’s 127. And I really have no reaction to it." ,
“Are you afraid of being drafted?” ‘
“It really makes no difference to me.”

A random questioning of University men who will turn 19 this year
revealed just such an unconcerned attitude toward the draft lottery
held Feb. 2. , _ .

The tone of those men unfortunate enough to draw a low spot on the
calendar—those first to be drafted—was one of acquiescence .‘

Though one freshman resident of Tower A said that he was not hap-
py with his position as number six on the list, he remarked. "What can
I say‘? That‘s the way inductees have tolbe picked. I guess it‘s the only
fair way. Ijust wish my luck would have been better.”

Although many responding felt that their draftability was beyond

' their control and totally inevitable, all were concerned about the fu-

ture of their college careers; The University ROTC_program was one
of the most prevalent alternatives cited by students with low numbers.-

March 7. the birthdate of one 11th ‘floor Tower A freshman, was the
second date to be pulled out of the drums. Preferring to remain name-
less, the student said that his parents were not too impressed with his
fortune and that he was even less enthused. '

‘fl guess I‘ll keep on here until I am drafted.“ he said. ‘‘I‘m going to
try and get into the ROTC program if I can. If I do enlist. I think the
Navy’willgetme." A V ‘

One student hunched over a book in «Hillman Library said that he
was quitting school after this term. ,

“Ionly came to college to..have something to do until lwould be
drafted.” he said. “I knew that I would get a low number.“

‘He was number 23. ~ ~ - p

Although the cut-off point for this year’s draft is not known, Draft
-Director"Curtis Tarr expects it to be far below last year's number of
125. A ‘ - '

While men born March 6. March 7,iand June 21 pondered their al-

Dollar for dollar, what are the
professors at Pitt worth?

Four hearings delving into the
question of faculty productivity
have been held within the last two
weeks, by the University Senate.

Dr. Alex Ducanis of the Depart-
ment of Higher Education chair-
ed the ad hoc committee which
presented the original study. He
was charged to do so by Univer-
sity Senate President Dr. Jack
Matthews in response to rising
expectations and, as Matthews
put it, .“more and more mention
of accountability, more and more
insistence on justification of the
use of money.

Collegiate pot smoking mounts

A recent Gallup poll reveals
that marijuana use among Amer-
ican college students is on the in-
crease with 51 per cent reporting

' yielding- to progress.‘ Demolition o
ed by the end ofthis month. '

   

 
  
  

ognize that much being done is '

looking at papers, counseling and

. just ‘talking to‘ students. Produc-
tivity might be measured as arbi-
trarily as‘the number of hours a
faculty ’ member put in each
week.” -

A modified definition of the stan-
dards to be used in measurement
of productivity included such cat-
egories as teaching, research,
personal production of works,
public service, administration and
personal education.

Recommendations were present-
ed at a Feb. 4: hearing by E. Ger-

juoy, Department of Physics and '

chairman, Senate Educational and
Budget Policies Committee.

., When the report is‘ rewrit-
ten following suggestions at the
hearings, Gerjuoy asked that it
contain six ofhis revisions, in-
cluding “a firm statement that the
measure of University Faculty
members is not the hours he says
he puts in, but what he ‘accom-
plishes, : and , at second inclusion
that anaffirmation that the ex-

' gpected cost~~per student should be

computed for each department,”
on a mutually agreeable basis. _

Ata hearing Monday,’ the com-
mittee continued its discussion of

criteria for ‘evaluating faculty. '

One participantnoted the need for‘
a faculty member to look good in
the eyes of his neighbors. Though
a faculty member may put in
many hours, neighbors see him
home at peculiartimes. Unhappy
with their pay or wo_rk clock, they .

that they have used the drug at

least once. _

begin wondering about the 1%-

mate cost of education. “Maybe

we will have to put in something ' A

that approaches 9 to 5,” a parti-
cipant speculated. -

TEACHING VS. PUBLICATION

One objection to this proposal
was voiced by another faculty
member. “I don’t get paid for the
amount of teaching I do,” he said,
“I get paid for publication. It’s
my way of negotiating.” '

Indeed, Ducanis closed the meet-

-ing, saying we m-ust “examine the - . - 1

goal of the University—it may
well not be teaching.” ,

Only about 20 people partici-j
pated in Monday’s session, and '
Ducanis noted wryly that “atten-
dance has not been overwhelm-
ing.” ' ..
SCREECHING HALT FEARED~

Despite the attendance, how-
ever, a number of concerned vis--
itors expressed the feeling that

the report was indeed a good C ,,

study. They were afraid “of things
coming to a screeching halt,” now

be ‘discharged and now that the‘,
report is nearing completion.

Asked whether the University-
Senate may take the committee’s,
conclusions and do something‘
about them, Ducanis reminded
that a “strong faculty commit- ‘
ment to goals” is necessary. '

The findings of the study are to
be sent to Harrisburg, once the
Senate agrees and acts on spe-
cific details. '

   

pot at least once, a 1969 survey;

showed this figure increasing to I

22 per cent. The figure nearly--'

doubled between 1969 and 1970;-_ ..

when it jumped to 42 per cent.
The results of the surveylare

. based on personal interviews with  
1,063 college students on 57 cam-"V _ ,

puses. V I
According to the survey, many ,

of those trying the drug forthe “ "

first time had used it recently.

Amongthe 51 per cent who had I

tried the drug, four out of five had
used it in the last year, and three‘
out of five had used it within the
last 30 days. ‘

Students who had smoked mari-y A

juana within the last 30 days used
it on an average of nine times a
month. -

Five per cent of this student
population reported using mari-
juana on at least 25 of the 30 days
preceding the interview.

Social science and humanities

majors, the survey indicated,-

were more likely to have used the

drug’ within the 30 day period than _  -.

students majoring in other areas.

It was also found that students
whose fathers had attended col‘-.

lege were more likely to be users 

than students whose fathers had
not gone beyond high school.

Remaining names would be

dents’, two from the health pro-

students. '

Chairman "of Legal Aware-
ness. Bob Ging. said "By oper-

inate the alleged inequities and
unconstitutionalities in the Ju-
dicial Code and the manual of
Student Rights. In the present

to reverse.

Walt Wills, representing the

mented, “The Committee's claims
are valid, and I approve of them.
Students should back this pro-
posal by telling administrators.
or by coming to the Legal Aware-
ness office."

mountain climber who was miss-
ing for five days in the equator-

game reserve warden and a self-
proclaimed wanderer, Ed Rober-
son just happens to be a poet and
an instructor at Pitt.

Prior to, assuming a

‘teaching position in the English

Department .two-and-a-half years
ago, Roberson was a Pitt student.
“Myﬂacademic history is prob-
ably the worst of anyone here,”
he says, eyes laughing.
V “At one point, my friends
were 'college.” _I guess every-
body goes through it. One of my ’

- friends was in charge of history.

We’d be talking about Whitman.
and he’d pop in about the Civil

'War. It's an unbelievably valid

education.” ‘

“You get into a lonelinessif
you don’t find somebody to teach
you,”~ he said quietly. “Notice
the people who have gotten to
65 and have something to teach
—they’ll ask you back.”

 

 

, ROBERSON _
You Get into Loneliness

In the teaching situation Rober-
son differentiates between the
"classroom people" and the "com-
munity of learning people." He,
said that his night classes are
especially fun, because these
students share their thoughts
to a greater degree than others.

He said that he’d_ like people

to “wander through books,
through college. and ask ques-
tions.“

earn transportation money.

Roberson's enthusiasm over
Van Peebles’ Ain't Supposed to
Die a Natural Death has the
whole class reading and prepar-
ing for the play.

“You don’t mind reading eight
or nine books for Roberson’.s
class,” one of his students said.
“In fact, after he discusses them
in class, I find myself reading
them over again, just to get more

do that,” the student said, laugh-

ing and shaking his head.

serve liquor until a ruling on the
appeal is handed down. ‘

The dispute over Mory’s poli-
cies toward women has raged
since Yale accepted a limited
number of female students three
years ago. At that time. two
Yale administrators urged Mory’s
to serve liquor to women. whe-
ther accompanied or not.

Mory’s refused, on the grounds.

that it is a private club, and pri-
vate clubs are free to discrimin-
ate against any group, including
women.

Outraged. someliwomen and a
group of Yale faculty members.
students. and alumni organized
a movement to break down sex
barriers at Mory's ‘

In its plea before _the Con-
necticut State Liquor Commis-
sion. the group successfully con-
tended that Mory’s is not a pri-
vate club. because its Board of
Directors is self-perpetuating
and is not elected by the gener-
al membership.

Despite the uproar over Mory’s
the Whiffenpoofs continue to sing
there eyery Monday night. in
keeping with a tradition that is
over 60 yearsold. .

Since ’1909, the Whiffenpoofs
have sung the famous Whiffen-
poof Song at Mory's along with
and.
more recently, folk and rock num-
bers.

Asked if the Whiffenpoofs have
taken a stand on the Mory‘s dis-
pute. Whiffenpoof Spencer Har-
rison replied that the Whiffen-
poofs are strictlynoncommital
on the question.

However, Harrison indicated
that some Whiffenpoofs do sym-
pathize with the women who
want to be served. "Many of
us would love to have the wo-
men at Mory‘s ” Harrison said.

Loyal to Mory’s the»Whiffen-
poofs sang at the tavern Mon-
day night, despite the Liquor
Commission’s ruling.

But time will tell how loyal to
the Whiffenpoofs are, if they
find they must choose between

Moscow lAP)—Once a Soviet
citizen gets his own refrigerator
he‘s in real trouble if it breaks
down. Pravda reported Monday.

The paper said its investiga-
tion showed approximately 11,-
000. refrigerator owners on the
Ukraine . waiting lists for ‘ re-
pairs. It added that the situation
in the Ukraine is not rare.

The Communist party organ
looked into the repair problem
after it received several letters
of complaint.

“I called in a. mechanic and
he established the source of the
failure and never appeared
again,”. wrote one irate refriger-
ator owner. ’

One letter writer said he .sent
his guarantee documents to the
plant three times in an effort
to get his refrigerator fixed and
each time the documents were
returned to him.

 

Area workshops are supposed to
fix refrigerators under the
guarantee. but they have no
spare parts. A shortage of repair
parts plagues many branches of
the Soviet consumer industry.

While all this is going on, 11,-
000 Ukrainian families wait to
get their refrigerators repaired.

The Soviet Union has stepped

President Nixon has.made a compre-
hensive and reasonable attempt towin
peace in Southeast Asia. Recently, the
President revealed his eight point peace
I’ plan. He proposed: ,
 -1,); Total U.S. andgallied withdrawal from
~iSouth Vietnam within six months of an
"agreement; 2) Release of all prisoners in
jndem with the troop withdrawals; 3) In-
ternationally supervised elections, with
,1,-the~ resignation of the Thieu government
--gone month before balloting and a pledge of
neutrality from. the U.S.; 4) A returnto
h_e?spirit of 1954 Geneva agreement on ‘In-
dochina and the 1962-agreement on no
more foreign intervention in Indochina; 5)

ry Kissinger, the President‘s national se-
curity advisor, revealed that the United
States also offered North Vietnam $2.5
billion as part of a’ $7.5 billion Indochina
reconstruction program when the war ends.

a All of these sweeping proposals were

made public after months.of secret nego-

tiations to unite the American.people and

world opinion behind a peace program. 4

This unity of opinion would hopefully pres-

, sure Hanoi to begin bargaining in earnest.

At home. the President’s announcement
did achieve part of.its purpose. Most Amer-

-icans have tentatively supported the.eight
‘. point peace plan as at le_ast a fruitful start-

ing point. .

Democratic presidential" hopefuls
Humphrey and Jackson indicated support.‘

Families‘ of POWS gave the plan a quali-
fied endorsement. Some ‘presidential .as-

pirants, Senator McGovern. former.-Sen-_

ator McCarthy, and Representative‘ Mc-
Closky attacked the speech. McGovern

-- called it a“clever political performance.” .

However, it appears that Hanoi, in the
short run, will not be pressured into peace.
The North Vietnamese are still determined
to gainpolitical control of South Vietnam.
The Hanoi leadership seems ‘to believe

anything less than guaranteed control of
the South affronts the dignity and honor of
their cause of national liberation.

For decades. they have been dedi-
cated to this .cause: to drive out all for-
eign soldiersand unify the nation under
control of the Workers (Communist) Par-
ty of Vietnam. ‘

Convinced that their cause is right. they
deeply distrust all outsiders who try to

' preach compromise. They probably feel
that North Vietnam has sacrificed too,

much in blood and national wealth to give
up the struggle now, especially so close to
what they hope expect is total victory. So
anything less remains unacceptable.

This was indicated last week when the
National Liberation Front, or Vietcong,

delegation dismissed the President’s eight- _ .

point proposal as mere “electoral propa-
ganda” to ‘.‘feel public opinion.” _

They said»-the plan wouldn‘t stop Viet-
namization or U.S. military aid to the
Saigon government and would maintain the

"puppet regime” of President Nguyen Van _

Thieu in office. Instead. North Vietnam
wants the U.S. to stop aiding Saigon and
wants the American government to over-
throw President Thieu.

lation ?  

"They have asked us . . . to change the
government directly. generously leaving
the method to us." Mr. Kissinger explain-
ed after the demand was made. And yield-
ing to that demand. he asserted. is “some-
thing on which there can be no question."

Of course, we should be willing to ne-
gotiate with the North Vietnamese.But that
does not mean we should necessarily have
to capitulate to the enemy. ’

However. our long and divisive debate
over‘ the tragedy in Vietnam has blurred
and clouded the obvious. We are now so
willing to right our wrongs in this war that

we are ready to seek any “reasonable"

political compromise.

But the North Vietnamese are not. In the"

foreseeable future, they will not readily
bargain away any chance of gainir_ig,pol1-
tical control of the South.

They smell victory as more American_

troops come home and as more “reason-

able” Americans demand that ‘we cut off- -

support of the Thieu government.

We should remember, though, that out-
right Capitulation and surrender of our

-position is not reasonable. That would
. make the Vietnam tragedy absurd.

- The following was written as an open letter to

5. This letter is our reaction to remarks ‘attri-
‘.bu'ted to you in a Pitt News interview, Friday, Jan.
V28,”1972, entitled “Professor Scores Reverse Ra-

tive,Action."

A We ignore those personality needs of yours
: whichcause you to state that you enjoy hostilities.
_‘What does concern us, however, are your views of
racism. Universities throughout the country are
accused of racism. Your statement that the Uni-
-.versity of Pittsburgh is racist. is in no way novel.
"The Chancellor, the Board of Trustees and faculty
1 recognize. these problems. ’ —

s%2%sPage of Opinion;

 

’ black racism exists at this University. We must
_ ‘take exception to your definition of being “pro-
 ;Black, pro-Jewish, or pro-Southern" as racism. In
1 fact, we question whether being “pro-anything" is
i in itself racist. ‘ “V ._
‘ Racism, we believe, has been well defined by
" Carmichael and Hamilton in Black Power as ac-
_ tions (not views) taken by one race against an-
,"other which has the effect of dehumanizing the
“latter. It is not possible to‘ascertain what you
V“ mean by reverse racism.
_ But we do positively assert that there is no
 reverse racism at Pitt in which Blacks are threat-
 ening, or mistreating or dehumanizing whites. In-
' deed the charge is ludicrous on its face.

’ g_ - You are quoted as being in opposition to the
" destandardization of admission policies as regards
 blacks and other minority groups. "It is easier,“
you say, “to bring men up to institutional values
V ,rather than to bring an institution down to ill-
’ ‘equipped men.”

This statement, probably more than any other
 enlightens us about your real views. You see in-
I stitutions as static, sacrosanct and existing apart
from people. -

We think not.

In the first place change is inherent in all in-
stitutional process. Secondly by innuendo -you
suggest that a “change" of admission policy be-
comes “destandardization.” Yet it must be ob-
 vious that all admissions policies are temporal in
 “nature. Society would not be better served if it
were otherwise. - .

  
 
 
 
 
  
  
    

  

We think that institutions are designed and
_ "created to meet the needs of people and abhor that
, situation where people must rearrange them-
selves in order to be in harmony with their (?) in-I
stitutions.*We, therefore, commend those institu-

What is novel is your insuation that a pro--

1’ tions which have re-examined their operations and

nic, the disadvantaged. women, and others find
opportunities .to contribute to our society. We
think much too much is yet to be done: But we ap-
prove of the direction. ‘

We suggest that “it is entirely possible to ini-
tiate the education of the American Indian, black
and‘any others into community colleges and small-
er colleges to the degree that theyshow even mini-
mal , capacities.” We agree and

go one step further and say that community col-b

leges are capable of teaching all of the undergrad-
uates i'or the first two years. Conceivably, the
community colleges do a better job than is pre-
sently observed in many of the larger institutions.

But that really isn’t the issue here. Again by .
innuendo you have relegated community colleges

to an inferior position as an educational institu-
tions. Consistently you then consign “inferior”

« students to them. We say that while it is true that

‘community colleges may educate those of “mini-
mal capacities” so can the,University“of Pitts-
burgh. The many successful programslof UCEP
provide-ample evidence of this. . . ‘ -

Further,‘ does the addition of capable persons
to the faculty without Ph.D.-‘s destandardize the
educational process, Mr. Lee? ' - 

_ We find’ it no surprise that you resurrect that
high priest of racism. Thomas Jefferson,as your
patron saint; F.or he, too, espoused an effete in-
tellectualism which consisted of speaking and
writing of the rights ofmen but practiced slavery.
As for his statement to prospective teachers at

the University of Virginia alleging their lack of _

fear for following the truth. we believe that the.

racial exclusionary policy of that institution is suf-

ficient commentary on the “truth” followed.

' Finally, Mr. Lee, we do not question your
right to your views, we go even further and insist
upon them._ What we do deplore is the misconcep-
tions which occur from poorly defined positions.
Your attack upon life experience equivalences and
earning a Master’s degree before ,-the completion
of the Baccalaureate degree are cases in point.

The issue of life experience itself is ‘a rela-
tively new idea. It is being discussed in various
schools at Pitt to add quality to our programs. It
is not possible to do it justice by a discussion
here. I

I No one of us. Mr. Lee. can us’urp the function
of all of us. There can be no ultimate arbiter of the
roles and policies of a university lest it be the so-
ciety. This University is here to serve society in
ways that provide all of our citizens opportunities
for life-enriching experiences in order to contri-
bute to a better community. Our aim is to provide
both quality and equality.

We hope we can realize that dream for all our
citizens.

PIRG’S ‘coercgive’

 

I / ’ . .

Editori A - x 1 ‘ _- \

Recently Ralph Nader‘s Public Interest Research Group has been
petitioning Pitt students to have a “tax” of two dollars per term placed
on the academic invoice. the monies to be used by PIRG for some rath-
er ill-defined purpose. ‘

Although we‘have no quarrel with PI-RG’s motives. we do find fault .
with its methods for procuring funds. » . . i

I 4 Over 6.000 students have signed the PIRG petition so far. When we
considerthe amount of consideration most students gave the issue be-
fore signing, how many might be students not returning to the Univer- .
sity after thisterm, orhow many students just gave into the hard—sell -3.»
of PIRG soliciters, the number isnot as impressive. The issue does per-‘ "

 

- haps merit a student vote, but it should not be decided on the basis of a

petition alone.

More important, however, than the mere parliamentary question
of the petition, is the real issue of the position of a non-university group
with the University. ' -

This University never has. nor should it have, endorsed’ any poli-. . - l‘.
tical or qua si-political organization. _ ‘ ‘ 
Students may join or f_or_rr_i organizations“ with the support of the  
student activities fee. .The allocations forthese groups are.decided by ﬁg

the student government. not by the organizations themselves, as PIRG
is trying to do. g_ V ‘ g
If PIRG does not choose to be an official University organization ..

receiving funds from the student activities_fee, it should accept its stat-
us as an independent group with independent financial resources.

‘ Again-we emphasize that we support PIRG’s idealsiand motives.’

Campaigninglulie visits "children,
smiles at herded -newsmen

by LOIS LEVINSON

It was up against the wall for the
reporters and camermen who
lined the auditorium of the West
Penn School for the Blind on Bay-
ard St. last Tuesday.

“Why the hell are we here?"
moaned’ a cameraman and the
sentiment echoed on down the
line. "Whats the broad do that
makes her so special?” '

Special or not, when Julie Nixon

Eisenhower walked down the mid- ‘

dle aisle of the auditorium. she
was her father’s daughter, so the
lights flashed around her and the
disgruntled cameramen went to

. work. " ‘ ‘

And everyone kept on working
that way for the next few hours
to show Pittsburghers how lucky
they are to have been visited by
the President’s concerned daugh-
ter.

After the school choir lauded
her presence, a small boy, picked
because “he is so‘ handsome,"
handed Julie a gift which she ac-
cepted with sincere gratitude,

‘ Then the boy was given back the

gift which he had‘ to hand her
again so that the photographers
could snap the scene from another
angle.

Julie said that she too had
brought them a gift but had mis-

‘ takenly left it at the airport. It

was a record composed by Pat
Nixon. called A Tour of the White-
house for the Visually Handicap-
ped. She invited them all to come

to the White House so they could’,

sit on Lincoln’s bed.

A whistle-stop tour of the school I

ensued so thatnlulie could satiate
what her advance release‘ called
“her keen interest in the educa-
tion of the visually handicapped.'''

‘ Name '
City

 
  
 

In an art class. third graders
stitching together paper fish
complained of the bright lights
when Julie and her entourage
moved in on them.

One child she talked to kept yell-,

ing, "Wow! I’m on TV." Another

asked. "How do you know Presi-

dent Nixon?" She told him. “I’m
his daughter.“ “Ooo,” the child
replied, “then I'm getting out of
here."

The children were toldthey could

ask questions and obediently rais-_ ‘

ed their hands. Q‘.‘What isit like to

live in the White House?” A. “It’s.

exciting like'living‘in' a bighotel.
You are always running into im-
portant people.” Q. “How does it

"feel to be the daughter of the Pres-

iden_t?'{ A. ""‘Just'iike'it does to be
the child of any man who does
good things that you’re very proud
of,—like your daddies!”

During the melee, secret serv-
icemen grimly directed the big.
production with a ‘firm hand. They
led the press through passage-
ways. short cuts and back en-
trances but under no circum-
stances did they allow reporters
to get close enough to Julie‘ to
catch her off guard with a ques-
tion. . .

The highlight of the day; and
just what all we herded reporters

had been waiting for wasthe five-

minute press conference ‘we were
granted inthe library of the Wash-
ington Educational Center in Law-
renceville.

Eisenhower said she is
ignoring her‘ career for a while
to accept engagements her par-
ents. couldn’t attend, just as .“Da-

’vid and I campaigned for my fa-

ther in 37 states in the last elec-

tion.” This at least gave me.
more of an idea about why we
_were there. ‘

y Eisenhower said she didn't
think much of surprise anti-war
protests like the one_recently
staged by a singer at a White
House gathering. "It was not the
right place ortime and so it back-
fired.“', she said. Referring to the
singer, Julie concluded that she
"was totally irrational in saying ’
that the bombing in Vietnam is
killing people, wildlife. and veg-
etation." '

How‘s that again?

When you're typing the big one, the 30-page
paper you've been sweating for weeks, that's when
mistakes bug.you the most. So you slow down.

the more you clutch up. Mess up now and you've _

Unfortunately, the quality
of network programming has fail-
ed to grow with the audience
size. The basic forms remain un-
changed: the Western, the situa-

tion comedy, the doctor show,

the variety hour, the old good
movie, the new, not-so-good
movie, the detective or police
show, the soap opera, the game
show. ,. . and that’s about it.
Amazing how much time we spend
watching so little.

How many times has Little
Joe been framed for: murder in
a strange town? How many times
has Matt Dillon been shot? Al-
most as often as Miss Kitty has
been kidnapped by nefarious des-
perados. How many drug push-

 can't thinkof anything less

amusing than ‘the death of a

parent in a young family, but I.
must have a warped sense of
humor, according to American
TV standards.

Clearly television programming
reflects the mood of the country.

of war movies being shown on
TV. The Longest Day, Bridge
on the River Kwai, In Harm’s
Way, Where Eagles Dare._and
so on ad nauseum. It seems that

mediocre.

 

This is not to infer that Ameri-

This year, everyone is watch-
ing programs with themes of
law and order. Cops and detec-

just any old fuzz. This year you
have to be handicapped. Iron-

blind. Calumbo has the charm of
a bulldog, Cannon is fat, McMil-
Ian has a moron for a wife, Mc-
Cloud is a hick ‘in the big city

 if  that all there is?

Fake funk ﬂunks Copeland

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Ruth Copeland is what she is—-
an enigmatic entity, a question
mark. The recently released I Am
What I Am glimmers faintly as a
reflection of the artiste. a vague
creation devoid of genuine sub-
stance. Her undeveloped stylis-
tic traits surface all too noisily.
with the inherent flaws unfortun-
ately gaining the upper hand.

Regretfully, Copeland must be
condemned for the sin of artificial
funk: grappling with the demands
of/soul, struggling vainly to ex-
press anguished emotion. and suc-
cumbing with a sigh under the
thumb of her innate pretensions.
Evidently. the flesh is willing. but
the spirit is weak—or something
to thateffect. .

For while Ruth is an unquestion-
ably gifted chanteuse. this parti-
cular attempt may merely be
credited with two rather qualified
successes. In what is perhaps the
most meritorious cut, "The Med-
al." some pleasant piano-backed
softness is set off with a rocking
chorus and awarded a gold star

I for effort.’ But the pitifully inade-

quate lyrics suffice to stiflejan al-
most believable vocal.

And therein lies the rub. Each
vocal comes acrossas generally
affected and ineffective, particu-
larly where the phrasing is con-

cerned. While slick control re-.

mains no substitute ' for -soul,
Copeland appears unaware of this
glaring fault; consequently, her

renditions lack spontaneity and
fire. -

Though the bluesy “Crying Has
Made Me Stronger” is "delivered
unfeelingly. it stands out as
among the finer cuts on the disc.
"Gimmie Shelter“ is mediocre.
with Copeland's wailing failing to
capture the intensity developed in
versions by the Rolling Stones and
Merry Clayton.

Another Stones‘ composition.
"Play with Fire." sputters and is

extinguished in the forced breath-'

iness of the drawn-out vocal. If
Copeland would just sit back and
do what comes naturally. such
performances could profit consi-
derably. '

Instead, songs like “Hare Krish-

na” strive to become a soul-gos-
pelish, hand-clapping proclama-
tion of God’s universality, and
come off as trite, bothersome ex-
ercises, not worth half the listen-
ing effort. The wages of sin, I
presume.

"Suburban Family Lament"
may feature the albums worst.

most contrived vocal, while
"Don’t You Wish You Had" has
absolutely nothing.

Meanhwile, some of us have it
and others do not—and though
Copeland definitely does, the ques-
tion remains-—what is she going to
do with it? For Ruth Copeland is
what she is—and that’s all that
she is, which ultimately is not
quite enough. Not yet.

'Farragan’s Retreat’ hailed -

as tart American satire

by DEVERA BERGER
Farragan’s Retreat, Bantam, $1.50 paperback.

What do you say about a 46-year-old man asked to murder his draft-
dodging son? That his family is super‘-patriotic? That they are driven
semi-insane by bigotry and religious hypocrisy?

After reading Tom McHale’s biting novel, Farragan’s Retreat, you
could say all these things. McHale’s novel has been placed on the same
level as Catch 22 and his Reinhartnovels. and hailed as a m"ajor'Amer-

ican work.

The book starts out as a bizarre characterization of an Irish-Amer-
ican family. andends as a macabre whodunit. Arthur Farragan. the
principle character, is goaded into participating in the murder of his
peacenik son by his hawkish brother and sister.

Instead of following through, Arthur pretends to go on retreat, en-
abling him to warn his son of the murder plot. While Arthur does this,
the portraits of his highly demented family and acquaintances develop.

There is Arthur’s other brother who is a "priest in a cage," Ar-
thur’s saintly wife, his depraved mistress, and his eunuch friend.

' Binky Applebaum. just to name a few.

As the action gains momentum through McHale’s tartness and
energy, new developments take place turning the novel into a full-blown

mystery.
pieces.) V

(Arthu’f‘s brother and sister are systematically blown to

Living in suspicion of everyone, Arthur finally discovers the whos,
the whys,,and the wherefores of the murders. But in doing so, all of
Arthur Farragan’s life is tragically mangled. - I

This is Tom McHale’s second novel—his first was Principate, writ-
ten in a similar satiric and energetic vein. . 

McHale’s black comedy jokes peppered with perverse comment
meant to satirize the American way are invigorating. This is one story

you just might love.

stretch to their basketball season and very little motivation to
attack it. ‘ , 1 - I

An 8-9 record for a team that was supposedly tournament.
bound does not sit well in the minds of many people in theUni-
versity community, especially the large number of loyalffans
hungry for, a winner. Now i these fans are looking for
answers to the problems, getting more .and more ‘tired of the

excuses. One of the answers-. an  that was never‘ given as '

Few Panther fans will remem-
ber last year’s Pitt-Kent State
contest. but holdovers from last
year’s squad probably can‘t for-
get it. The Panthers’ Christmas
vacation loss last season was one
of their biggest heartbreakers of
the campaign.

Tonight at 8 p.m. at the Field
House; the cagers get their
?chance to avenge that 67-60 loss
at KSU’s gym.

With over four minutes remain-
'ing in that meeting.the Panthers
held a 60-56 margin’. Aided by four
personal fouls and a technical. the
Golden Flashes stole the victory
from the‘Panthers‘ grasp.

.' The Flashes’ hero in those clos-
ing minutes was 6-2 guard Ruben

'Vanée, who hit eight straight

points, to finish with 20.

Nowca senior. -Vance is aver-
aging 19.4 per game to lead the

_ team in scoring. His strength lies

in his driving ability and his ac-
curate shot from deep in the back-
court - -

However; KSU has fared poorly
for most of the season. The Flash-_
eshave a 4-12 record with their-
only victories over Cleveland
State. Miami of Ohio. Bowling

‘Green, and Ohio,University.»

Among their ‘losses are defeats
to Ball State, ‘Northern Illinois,
Western Michigan, and Akron.

A Pennsylvania state runnerup at 168 pounds
,from MountLebanon. Jim Fleming has already
.whipped nine mat foes this season and hopes
to add to that total in the near future.

‘ . ‘"1 have a good shot at placing in the East-
.;erns." said Fleming. "There is only one 167
pounder definitely better than I am, and that is
"Penn State's Andy Matter. Concerning the na-
tionals, we’ll just have to wait and see.

 "Asa ‘team. we should not «finish lower than
thirdin the EIWA tournament (Easternsl. George

gBryant (-118), Randy Payne (126), Kevin Love

(150), and John Chatman (158) could all win

individual titles. Every man on the team is cap-

iable of placing. We just cannot afford any injur-
..ies." ' " _

.. Third in the 1969 Plebe Tournament at 167
and fourth in last‘ year’s EIWA tourney at 158,

Fleming is enjoying’ his most successful season

-as a senior. Nevertheless his sophomore year was
‘one he would like to forget.

_ "I stunk as a soph." related Fleming. “I
~ was second string to both Bobby Kuhn (167) and
i~ Buddy Morris (158). I just never got going. You
j-can-’t«.improve if you don't wrestle. and I just
‘_lf'7’could not break into the starting lineup. I think
- the experience _has helped me tremendously the
, last two seasons." ‘

A Throughout his mat career at Pitt. Jim "has
always been switching weight classes. He wants
;‘  to stick to one.

.‘‘Although I‘ am stronger at 158, and ‘would

Ferns, I still would rather compete at 167. I hate
.to cut weight. My normal weight is up around

“We can beat Penn State,” asserted Fleming.
‘-‘We have the personnel to match them man-

life to come close to Matter. I’ll wrestle Andy

Jim was very pleased at the team‘s .21-17.

victory over Clarion last month. The Golden

- Eagles plastered the Panthers in 1971. 30-5. and

Fleming was pinned by Bill Simpson in that
meet. January's rematch was sweet revenge.

I "I looked forward to Clarion f'or a, whole
year." explained Fleming. "Beating Les Bressler
(Clarion) was the most satisfying win I've ever
had at Pitt. except maybe for the 1971 Easterns."

Due to disciplinary reasons, Jim did not com-

one," says assistant coach Ig
Perez. and “'when he recovers
completely from the ligament
injury in his right hand he will
get a chance to prove it.“

Dan hails from Delaware, a
state not particularly noted for
its gymnastic teams, but he and
fellow teammate Chris Gardner
tried to change that image three
years ago when they were sel-
ected to perform for Pitt.

At the time’ Pitt was rebuild-

be part of the new thrust. But
things never seemed to jell and
the result was a bunch of frus-

else." says Campbell. "but it‘s

fa mi In backcourt role

‘Shaft’ Cardot spells Cub thins

by VINCE DiNARDO
At the helm of the successful season the Cubs have put together
so far this year is Willis Cardot. A classy guy both on and off the
court. Cardot is to the Cubs what Cleveland Edwards is to the var-

sity basketball squad.

At 5-10/. Cardot is not a giant in basketball circles. but Willis

has developed into the quarter-
backing playmaker of Tim Grg-
urich‘s gutty squad. Aside from

playing a major role in the
frosh‘s pressing zone defense
and the playmaking. the Erie

Prep guard has been the most
consistent scorer on the fresh-

man team with a 17.4 average‘

per game.

To come to Pitt, Willis turned
down offers from Nevada. Kent
State. and Gannon College as
well as a number of smaller
colleges around the Erie area.

“I was very impressed with
Pitt’s program,” said the hope-
ful Med student “It’s close to
home and the coaches were very
honest. They didn’t hand me any
bull like some of the other
coaches I talked to.” '

"Inthe past, I've been blessed I

with good backcourt men,” noted
frosh coach Tim Grgurich. "Wil-
lis is no different. He has gain-
ed the respect of his’ teammates.
They don’t have to worry about
the ball coming upcourt, they
know Cardot will do it.”

Grgurich also indicated that
Willis knows what, to «do with
the ball once it’s upcourt.

“He runs the offense,” con-

tinued Grgurich, “he has the
ability to find the open man and
is also able to hit the big shot
when we need one. He is learn-

ing to be a leader and is a good
competitor.”

Will has been playing basket-
ball since he was in sixth grade.
He insists that he still has a lot
to learn, but believes he is mak-
ing progress. "

"Practice has helped me. a lot
and I‘m getting more confi-
dent with each game.”

Playing fine basketball isn't
the only thing that Cardot has
done since his arrival in Oak-
land. Recently Will purchased a
knee length leather coat which
earned him the rather dubious
nickname of John Shaft, from
the recent movie Shaft.

Ironically. Cardot seemed, to
have gotten the shaft in a recent
comparison of guards by one of
the local city newspapers.

In the Robert —Morris game.
which the Cubs lost 64-57, Jesse
Hutson, the Colonials’ playmak-
er, was made to sound as the su-

—perior ballplayer. Hutson- scor-
ed 22 points in that game—the .

high scorer—to Cardot’s 10 points.
Actually, Hutson, scored four
field goals and 13 of 16 shots
from the charity stripe. Cardot.
on theother hand scored all his
points from the field, and had no
foul tries. \

The Cubs were in a situation
where theyhad «to foul to get

the ball and Hutson, unfortunate-
ly was the wrong man to foul.

I

"We're glad we’ve got Cardot."
said Grgurich, "I wouldn‘t trade
him for a million bucks. He is
a key to our program. He shoots
well, plays defense, and has good
driving ability. He also has a
little fight in him. which is good.

— I think he got a raw deal in the

—photo by Matis
newspaper story."

Aside from being a little dis-
gruntled, Cardot took the story
in stride.

The_ Cubs will get another
shot at avenging the loss to R0-
bert Morris later in the schedule.
Of course they will be eager to
win. but for ‘Shaft' Cardot, more
than the final score will be rele-
vant.

Q

A PAULIST DOESN'T
WAIT TO BE
ORDAINED
TO GET
INVOLVED.

If you think
that ordination
is something
like graduation
——and the time
in between is  . ‘
similar to marking time—theh
you couldn‘tbe more mistake.n.

The Paulists were founded
with the belief that each man is _
a member of the community and
he contributes his own thing. —
Each is an individual«with his
own talents and he is given the
freedom to use them in his own
way. But not later. Now. »

For instance, during _the no-
vitiate, novices work in such
diverse areas as hospitals, voca-
tional rehabilitation centers and
Universities.They serve as assist-
ant chaplains, co-retreat masters,
student teachers and psychiatric
aides.

Paulist Seminarians create
recreational programs, direct
“Days of Recollection” for CCD
students, direct film series, e7_(-
periment with the use of media
in the liturgy as a preaching tool,
originate and edit the Paulist
Free Press, coordinate Lenten

-lectures and orga_nize Home.
Masses, to mention Just a few.

When you commit yourself to
the Paulists, it isn’t a someday
thing. It’s now. Today.-

For more information about
the Paulists write to: Rev. Don-
ald C. Campbell, C.S.P., Voca-
tion Director, Room 300.
