News Editor

Students rallied outside of the William Pitt Union
for Lynn Yeakel, Pennsylvania’s Democratic senato-
rial candidate, yesterday afternoon.

“[The student turnout] is wonderful and everyone
seems so positive,” Yeakel said. “And everyone
seems registered to vote.” She said that out of all
the people she talked to, only two said they were

not registered to vote.

Yeakel, along with U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, talked with press and students on the
Fifth Avenue side of the Union. The crowd of
approximately 100 held signs and chanted her

name .

Yeakel and Kerrey walked through the Union
and down Forbes Avenue, on their way to the
Original Hot Dog Shop, shaking hands of passers-

by.

While at the “O,”
Kerrey tried a hot dog.
“Fifty-five is a good
year for hot dogs. I
love them,” he said
with a smear of mus-
tard on his face.
Yeakel said that her .
vanilla milk shake was delicious. Linda Simon

Panelists predict

election

By John Temple
Staff Writer

A panel of Pitt-political
science and economic
experts had few positive
words to offer about
President Bush and little to
say about Bill Clinton.

Last night the panel mem-
bers predicted the election’s
outcome, discussed the
media’s role in the election
and evaluated the candi-
dates’ health care, economic
and foreign policy proposals.

The panel discussion,
sponsored by the political
science honorary society Pi
Sigma Alpha, was moderated
by the society’s president,
Doug McKalip. He read
audience questions to the
panel members after each
had given their perspectives
on particular subjects.

Unless Ross Perot draws
many more voters away from
Bill Clinton, Bush’s chances
are nil, political science’
Professor William J. Keefe
said. \ P

support from Democrats to

O7/tllCO7”}”l€

Keefe said that although
there is still a possibility for
Bush — especially with Ross
Perot in the race — it is not
likely that he will win.

“lBush’sl fall in popularity
is unprecedented in the 54
years since the Gallup poll
began measuring public
opinion,” he said.

On the other hand, over-
reliance on these ubiquitous
polls has been a problem
during this year’s campaign,
said political science
Professor Jeff Mondak, who
evaluated ‘the media’s
performance in the cam-
paign..

The media played a more
active role this year than it
did in 1988, investigating the
candidates’ charges and
advertisements rather than
just reporting them, Mondak
said. This has deterred the
presidential hopefuls from
making false statements
about their own or their
opponents’ records, he said.

Mondak also criticized the
format of the presidential
debates in which journalists
posed questions to the can-
didates, saying that this for-
mat did no.t challenge the
candidates with tough ques-
tions.

Political science Professors
Brian Ripley and R. E.
Owen addressed foreign pol-
icy choices and health care
while economics Professor
Jack Ochs discussed eco-
nomic issues.

An advisor from Governor
Bill Clinton’s campaign encour-
aged BiGALA members to
voice concerns they have for
the future of bisexual, gay and
lesbian communities.

Clinton’s Environmental
Advisor Bob Hattoy spoke yes-
terday to the students as a
member of the gay community.
He is also HIV-positive.

“This year, those of us in the
gay, lesbian and bisexual com-
munity have a candidate for
president that believes that we

should be part of whatever
plans there are for changing
America.” ‘

Hattoy said that it was a pos-
itive sign that an openly gay
staff member was working on
something besides gay and les-
bian rights.

“I happen to be an environ-
mental expert who happens to
be gay too,” he said.

Among the three presidential
candidates, Clinton supports
what the gay community cares
about, Hattoy said.

“You either vote for the
good, bad or the indifferent,”
he said.

Ross Perot has not addressed
gay and lesbian issues, Hattoy
said. And President George
Bush has done everything he
could to stand in the way.

Hattoy lashed out at Bush,
saying it is time to stop the
“politics of denial.”

“The policies for the last 12
years have, first of all, divided
people,” Hattoy said. “They’ve
denied the existence of the epi-
demic, they’ve allowed right-
wing moral bigots to set health

Oh I wish I were an Oscar

truly want to be; ‘cause if I were
an Oscar Mayer wiener; every-

one would be in love with me.

People do not have to be an
Oscar Mayer wiener for every-

but it does help if they drive
the 23-foot Oscar Mayer
wienermobile. (In hot dog
terms, the wienermobile is 52

one of the drivers, said that this
job is making her “a star for a

Oscar Mayer is looking for
college graduates with good
driving records to drive the
wienermobile, wave, smile and
pass out wienie whistles for a

year’s internship.

The interns travel over 50,000
miles in the wienermobile dur-

so that people have died.

“If I see anybody that’s gay
wearing a Bush T—shirt, I usual—
ly go up to them and say ‘you
obviously don’t have any
friends HIV—positive;’ If they
say [they] do, then I say ‘why
do you want to kill them?”

Members of BiGALA agreed
with Hattoy that although the
AIDS epidemic started in the
gay community, it is no longer
only a gay disease. Teenagers
are becoming one of the main
groups feeling the impact from
AIDS.

“[Right now] this country

would rather have teenagers
die of AIDS than teach them
about condoms,” Hattoy said.
“By electing someone to the
White House who cares about
us [the gay community]  all of
us can have hope.”

Hattoy praised Clinton’s
work in Arkansas, where con-
doms are distributed in high
schools.

Clinton supports an end to
military discrimination of gays
and lesbians, Hattoy said.

“As president, Clinton within
the first few weeks can say ‘we
shall end discrimination against
gays and lesbians in the mili-
tary,”’ Hattoy said. “You don’t

have to have Congress pass
anything  it’s done. That’s
probably one of the first things
we’ll see.”

Hattoy was asked to clear up
conflicting reports of Clinton’s
stand on Oregon’s Measure
Nine.

Measure Nine, if passed,
would define homosexuality in
that state as “abnormal, wrong,
unnatural and perverse.”
Homosexuals would not be
considered as a minority for
protection under anti-discrimi-
nation laws.

Hattoy assured BiGALA that

Clinton is opposed to such a

referendum and that Clinton

segment of society in that way.

“[Clinton’s] clearly on our
side in the issue,” Hattoy said.

The informal meeting was
arranged by BiGALA member
Sharon Davis, and the Pitt stop
was one of many for the
Clinton campaign advisor.

“I’ve been in 14 cities in nine
days talking to college stu-
dents, _ talking to environmen-
talists, talking to the gay and
lesbian community, talking to
people that Clinton wants as
part of the new America. He
thinks you’re important,”
Hattoy said.

After‘ the meeting, one
BiGALA member thanked
Hattoy for speaking openly.

Cdhen, daughter of the owner of the “O” said that her father
was very thrilled that they picked his store as the place to stop.

Yeakel said that she wants to put education at the top of the
nation’s agenda. T ,

She supports Clinton’s prospective program, the National
Service Trust Fund, for college students. The program involves
guaranteed student loans, which students will pay back through
community service. A *

“Anybody who wants to go to college can go to college,”
Yeakel said.

Kerrey said that if President George Bush had Ross Perot’s'
eats then maybe he would hear the needs for education. ‘

He urged the students to find as many of their friends as they
could to send the message of change to Washington, D.C. by
voting for Yeakel.

“The future is yours, you have to go vote,” Keney said.

He said that Dan Quayle’s last job will be swearing Yeakel in
as Pennsylvania’s next junior senator.

Pitt senior Jennifer Swoboda said she thinks it is wonderful
that Yeakel came on campus. “It reﬂects her interest in what
students have to say. She is interested in our futures.”

“I think Pennsylvania needs a change, and she is going to be
a great asset to the Senate,” Pitt sophomore Danielle Roe said
as she held up a sign in support of Yeakel.

said that he attended the rally to show his support for Arlen

Cline, another driver, said that
they go to festivals and parades.
“We’re a 24-hour parade that

said.

Ragsdale said they even meet
celebrities. She shuttled Leslie

hotel in Minneapolis.

The wienermobile was creat-
ed in 1956. There are now six
of them in the United States,

one in Spain, one in Portugal

The wienermobile is

Drivers earn a little over

Getting out the vote

The 1988 election was significant for two reasons.
The first, and most obvious, reason is that we had
elected a new president to serve us for the next four
years. The second reason is that the voter turnout
that year was the lowest in the history of this great
nation. America, the countrywhich prides itself on
being the epitome of democracy, was anything but
representative of that which it preaches. This time
though, the politicians were hardly to blame. No, get-
ting out to vote is the responsibility of one person
and one person alone — you.

On Nov. 3 we will be choosing between Bush,

. Clinton and Perot; Yeakel and Specter; Coyne and

King. Regardless of the boxes you choose, choose
one. ’ -

When a country has twice the voter turnout for a
referendum than we do for the most important gener-
al election in the world, there is a problem. When we
are trying to serve as a model for the newly-formed
delicate Democracies of Eastern Europe and can only
achieve a 40-percent voter turnout, the signal we
send is ominous. Fortunately, this can be solved quite
easily.

As the “safeguard” of Democracy [it is particularly it

important for college students to vote, since we are
the future leaders of this country. According to
Professor Ted Windt, 68 percent of all college stu-
dents vote, and their lifelong voting patterns are
formed the first few times they cast their ballot.
Therefore, it is imperative that you take the fate of
this country into your own hands and vote on Nov. 5.
If there is a strong turnout, talks about term limita-
tions will become blasé. Confidence of the political
system will be restored. Democracy will remain in the
hands of the voters, and legislatures will be held
more accountable. But for this to happen, you must
vote. _ ‘
Look at what has happened since the last presiden-
tial election. There has been good and bad. Abroad
— there was a war in the Middle East, freedom came
to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, there
is crisis in the Balkans and Somalia, and the growth

[ of the European Community downplays our role in

the world. Home — we are in the midst of a severe
recession, NAFTA signifies hope for the U.S., Canada
and Mexico, drugs and crime are running rampant
through the cities of America, and the environment is
now on everybody’s agenda.

What all of these events have in common is the role
our country plays. No other country in the world, for
now, exerts as much inﬂuence as ours does. Given
the circumstances, you have a duty — to yourself,
your children and your country. On Nov. 3 we don’t
care whom you vote for, just as long as you vote.

Congress is no longer a boy's club

1992 is not the Year of the
Woman. It is true that there are
116 women running for
Congress this year, 10 in the
Senate and 106 in the House. It
is also true that in the past two
years there has been a 49 per-
cent increase in the number of
women winning nominations
to Congress. This constitutes a
significant breakthrough for
women into a male-dominated
arena — politics. Butso what?
It may be a breakthrough, but
women candidates are viewed
by many as a novelty, they
have become political tokens.

1992 is still not the Year of
the Woman, but candidates are
showing that they are anything
but toys.

Why have women been kept
out of the political arena for so
long, and Why are they finally
being let in? Running for a
political office and being
female is enough of a barrier.

Women are breaking
through the male-dominated
political barriers, and issues

‘which normally wouldn’t be
considered relevant are now
on voters’ minds. A woman is
questioned about her status as
a woman, her position on fem-
inism and her family’s and hus-
band’s business dealings and
financial status.

If the truth be told, irrelevant
issues about
Ferraro’s husband’s financial
dealings brought about her
demise in the New York sena-
torial primary.

Women candidates also typi-
cally run against white male
incumbents. Beating an incum-
bent is difficult, but doubly so
if the opponent is a woman.
National positions in govern-
ment prefer candidates who
have experience. Again, most
women are at a disadvantage
because they begin their career

' in politics at a later age - after‘

most of their childrearing
duties are over. That affects
their level of experience.

So what has changed the

American political culture and
America’s public opinion?
Implicit inthe platforms in sev-
eral female candidates, wom-
en’s breakthrough into politics
can largely be attributed to the
general discontent people have
for the government and the
people — namely the men
who run government.

Lynn Yeakel is a Democrat
running for the Pennsylvania
Senate against incumbent Arlen
Specter. Her slogan is

Rachel

Haynes

Geraldine -

“Courage for a Change” and
the American public is looking

‘for a change -— a way out of

troubled economic times and
government scandals. A second
factor in the breakthrough is
that in 1992 preparation met
opportunity.

Because of the 1990 Census,
redistricting occurred, which
opened more political seats.
The growing pool for women
candidates coincided with the
increase in positions. More
women are obtaining law
degrees and the necessary edu-
cation to run for office. They
also have“~Tr1e community and
organizational ties that many
men don't have.

These factors have led to the
nomination of more women.
But it still isn’t enough. If all of
the wome-n running for
Congress were elected, which
is unlikely, women would still
only constitute about 10 per-
cent of the congressional pop-
ulation.

While that is a 50 percent
increase in Congress, it still
won’t allow women to signifi-
cantly affect legislation. Sure,
women will make some noise,
but what good is noise when.
no one listens to it?

Women are empowering
themselves and the feminiza—
tion of power is occurring.
Women have made a major.

crack in the political glass ceil-
ing this year. And women are
mad about the 12-year
Reagan/Bush legacy that has
created a backlash against
them, conservatized the federal
judiciary, which severely
restricted a woman’s right to
an abortion, and limited affir-
mative action and minority
rights. Yeakel’s initial reason
for running against Specter was
because of the way he handled
the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas
trials.

Claire Sargent, a Democrat
running for the Senate in
Arizona, won an upset primary
victory. She is now in a three-
way race against Conservative
incumbent John McCain (a
member of the Keating 5) and
former Governor, Evan
Mecham. Her opponents

attacked her and claimed that q

she was running on the slogan,
“I’ve' got breasts, vote for me.”

Sar-gent replied, “I think that
it’s time we voted for senators
with breasts.-After all, we’ve
been voting for boobs long
enough.”

1992 is not the Year of the

Woman, but it is a start. There
shouldn’t just be one year
reserved for women, instead
the goal should be to make the
19905 the Decade of the
Woman. At the rate that
women are entering Congress,
by the year 2000 they could
constitute 50 percent of the
congressional population; .
A By articulating women’s
issues, they are speaking for
themselves and using -their
voice in politics. When a_ bal-
ance of their new—found power
is combined with political
equality only then will a funda-
mental change occur in public
attitudes and public policy.

And this year, led by head

er powerful squad.

‘-Knoles’ team will be
anchored by its quad-cap-
tains, seniors Don Boyd,
James Austin, Kevin
.McLaughlin an_d junior Sean
Braud, along with last year’s
first—year se'n_sation, Matt
Brady. 8

“I’ll compare the talent on
our team with anyone else’s
talent. As far as talent goes,
we’re as talented a team as

' we’ve ever h-ad here at Pitt,”

Knoles said. “But desire is
another game. Desire is usu-

ally something that takes a
little maturity, and maturity
right now is somethingwe
just don’t have.” V

With only three seniors on
the squad, Knoles will be
counting heavily on a good
recruiting class.

“I’m very confident with
our recruiting class. We’ve
got a lot of kids with a hel-
luva lot of talent,” said

‘Knoles.

Some of those new kids
who should contribute to
this year’s team are High

swimmers Steve Salvi and
Tony .Sunseri along with
breaststroker Pete Gage.

.With the lack of experi-
ence on the team, Knoles
said he feels that molding
this year’s squad gives him a
personal challenge.

“I’m very optimistic about
what we can do,” Knoles
said. “This year is going to
test my ability as a coach to
pull a team together without

a lot of experience and try
to repeat, or do an 11—peat
or whatever, in the Big East.
I’m“c‘onfident' we can do
some damage there.”

Because of the amount of
success the men’s team has
had in the past and the level
of talent on the team,
Knoles said he is not only
looking to win the Big East
again, but also toward quali-
fying swimmers for the
NCAA Championships in

Rebuilt ‘Rome finds a home in Cleveland

By Rob Pugliese
Sports Assistant

It was a homecoming of sorts.

Yes, it was a far cry from the glory
days when fans in the rafters of
Fitzgerald Field House kept running
counts of his rebounds and chanted his
name piously. But the machine known as
Rome stirred memories of the old days.

Rome running the Civic Arena floor,
aggressively attacking the glass — and
still missing the free‘ throws. Entering and
exiting to spirited ovations. He has not
been forgotten here.

Looking slightly bulkier and significant-
ly stronger than he did in his Pitt Panther
days, Jerome Lane returned to the Steel
City Monday night as a member of the
Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavs and New
Jersey Nets were in town for the NBA’s
annual preseason visit to Pittsburgh.
While playing a modest 10‘ minutes, Lane
contributed in every way Cavs’ Coach
Lenny Wilkens asked. He finished with
five points, three rebounds, two assists

‘and a sense of appreciation for his old

stomping grounds.
“I’ve just been trying to concentrate on
fitting in basically,” Lane said of his new

setting. “It’s nice to come here and play
in front of thepeople that cheered you
on when you were in college  Not too
many people make it in the NBA from
Pitt either.”

It did not take Lane long to score,
quickly posting up Nets’ forward Jayson
William§,.and firing in a nifty hook shot.
But the two assists were the night’s high-
lights for Lane and most of the 8,230 in
attendance. _

First, a posting-up Lane dished a beau-
tiful no—look feed to a cutting Terrell
Brandon for an easy lay—up. ‘The next
possession Lane softly delivered a text-
book touch pass to Craig Ehlo for anoth-
er easy two. This sequence proved to be

one of the game’s most exciting

moments, igniting the crowd.

“I know I’m a terrific passer, and if I
see you, I’m gonna give you the ball -—
no problem,” Lane said. “I see the whole
ﬂoor great.” i l

‘He displayed vintage Rome rebounding
position, snapping down an offensive
board off a Gerald Wilkins’ miss and
strongly following to the hoop. On this
night, Lane proved he is a legitimate
NBA rebounder who could potentially
provide that missing piece-the Cavs need

to reach the ‘pinnacle — an NBA champi-
onship. '
“I feel that in the long haul I can help
this team out, and right now I think I’m a
little back,” Lane said. “T here’s 82 games,

and I think there’s some chances for.

H -

me.

“Jerome’s a good rebounder, he’s a
physical player, and he gives us a little
bit of a dimension now that we don’t
have on our team,” Cavs’ all-star guard
Mark Price said. “Lenny’s a ‘situational
coach, and I’m sure there’s gonna be sit-
uations where he’s gonna want to throw
[Lane] out on the floor. Jerome’s shooting
needs to improve a little bit, so he won’t
be able to play all the time  but there’s

gonna be situations.”

Since leaving Pitt after his junior sea-
son in 1988, Lane has not been able to
make his mark in three NBA seasons. A
first—round selection of the Denver
Nuggets in the ‘88 draft, Lane appeared a
perfect fit for then Nuggets Coach Paul
Westhead’s fast-breaking system. But
Lane’s stint in Denver was unproductive
— as were subsequent chances in
Indiana and Milwaukee. '

This, his fourth and possibly final

Pitt divers

need to
fill holes

By Josh Roth
Tbe Pitt News

For the Pitt men’s div-
ing team, overcoming
adversity may be the
key for this year’s group
to hold on to its status
as a powerhouse in the
Big East.

The loss of Phil Cruz
to graduation was
expected, but the unan-
ticipated loss of Mike
Naylor to academic diffi-
culties leaves head
coach Julian Krug with
some big shoes to fill.

“We lost Phil to gradu-
ation this fall, his eligi-
bility is all used up. But
he still comes around to
give the guys moral sup-
port,” Krug said. “We
also lost Mike Naylor to
academic problems.
Although he will be
back in school in
January, he will not be
eligible to dive for us
again.”

Both Cruz and Naylor
qualified for‘the NCAA
Championship pre-quali-

’ ‘ fications last year.

The main new man
diving for the Panthers
this year is first—year stu-
dent Jeremy McClean.
Krug is very high on
McClean and said that
he feels he should help
fill the holes left by the
loss ‘of two excellent
divers.

“McClean is in a posi-

_ tion to immediately help

out and make his pres-
ence felt in dual meets
and inevitably in the Big
East Championships,”
Krug said.

Also looking to make
their presence felt are
top returning divers

Steve Wolfe and team

captain Sean Braud.

Braud, who qualified
for the NCAA Cham-
pionships last year, will
be looked upon not
only as the top diver on
Krug’s squad but as the
mainstay and leader of
this year’s group.

“Sean, a junior, is cer-
tainly our top returning
diver from last year and
will be the leader of
our team,” Krug said.
“Steve, also a junior,
should also help lead
this year’s squad. We
do not have quite as
young a team as does

opportunity, might be Lane’s
best chance to contribute and
establish himself.

“I feel that I’m starting to fit
in better. I still have a lot of
things to work on, but I think
I’ll be all right,” he said.

Lane said he needs to get

‘ his rebounding timing back

and work on his free-throw
shooting — something he did
religiously during the off—sea—
son. Lane said he shot about
300-400 free throws and 150-
200 jump shots eveiy day over
the summer. His hard work

has resulted in the chance of

a lifetime.

“I always wanted to play for
the Cavs, even when I was a
little one,” Lane said.”  It’s a
dream come true.

“I just worked up there all
summer. I just worked with
their trainer the whole sum-
mer. They liked me and they
signed me.”

Lane said Wilkens has pro-
vided him with more teaching
than he has received at any
time since high school,

“The system I was in before
was just basically ‘if you don’t
know it now you won’t ever
know ‘it,’ and now it’s just a
whole different situation as far
as technique,” he said. “You
might have the skills but
there’s still some technique
that you need to maybe help
that skill that you have  This
is very comfortable for me. No
question about it.”

Thus far Lane has played
mostly small forward, with
some time at power forward,
logging 10 to 12 minutes a
game. His strength is still
working close to the basket,
posting up and, most of all,
rebounding. Lane’s 6—foot—6—
inch frame appears consider-
ably thicker with his weight
comfortably at 245 pounds.
Lane said Wilkens’ setting has
smoothed the transition and
motivated him to improve.

“When you’re with an older
team  you have players that
are already there  you have
time to work with the younger
players,” Lane said.

“This is a team that just
needs me to come off ...,just
work hard to relieve the play-

er that’s in front of: me so we?

can help win these ball-
games.”

Also OK for now are the
divers from Miami. Miami is
returning three of the top
divers in the country from last
year, and with the top three
Big East divers returning, they
will surely be tough.

Coach Krug, however,
said he is not worrying about
Miami.

Rather, he said he is trying
to get his team focused on his
ultimate goals, winning the
Big East with the swim team
and having some divers quali-
fy for the NCAA
Championships in March.

“Miami is going to be tough
to deal with. But we will be
very solid again this year,”
Krug said. “I would like to
narrow the gap between us
and Miami, but we will be
hard-pressed to do so with
the quality of their returning
divers.”

“Our focus in any dual
meet, however, is always only
on the championship end of
the year,” Krug said. “We
want to win the Big East,

  
     

 

 
 

   
 
 
     
  

qualify for the NCAAs and
score at the NCAAS. So I use
dual meets all as preparation
for that.”

The first dual meet for the
season will be this Saturday
morning in Syracuse. Coach
Krug said his team is pulling
together and does not foresee
any major problems against
the Orange.

“This is an early season
meet against a very tough
opponent overall in swim-
ming and diving,” Krug’ said.
“But there is a great deal of
pride in our athletes, and they
should hold together very
well.”

Krug said he is very pleased
with his team’s attitude thus
far and feels it is only a mat-
ter of time before someone
steps up and fills the shoes of
Cruz and Naylor.

“We have a good team, and
on a good team facing adver-
sity, someone always steps up
to fill the voids and con-
tribute. We have those people
on this team,” Krug said.
“We’ll be OK.”

East Championship,” Knoles
said. “But the big meet is at
the end of March in
Indianapolis, and that’s the
NCAA Championships. The
job is going. to be trying to
get to the big meet, which is
where I want to go.” A

Last year Don, Boyd was
Pitt’s only NCAA representa-
tive, swimming in two
breaststroke events.

Although Knoles said that
this year’s team is ahead of
schedule compared to last
year’s team, injuries, first-
year athlete eligibility prob-
lems and fewer coaches this
year are a few of the prob-
lems facing the Panthers’
squad.

“We’ve had a few injuries
to people so far,” Knoles
said. “But our biggest con-
cern is help on deck. The
NCAA cut back our number
of coaches on deck from
three totwo and we are in
desperate need of team
managers to help out on
deck.”

Miami, Syracuse and
Villanova should be the
Panthers’ toughest competi-
tion in the Big East this
year.

All

three schools had

' excellent recruiting classes,

and none lost as much tal-
ent to graduation as did
Knoles’ squad.

“Syracuse, Miami and
Villanova are all going to be
real tough this year,” Knoles
said.

“Right now it is just a horse
race to see who can get
their young kids to respond
and focus on'what they
need to do.”

The Panthers’ first meet of
the season is this Saturday
at Syracuse.

Their first home meet of

A the season is Nov. 6 when

James Madison will visit

- Trees Pool.
