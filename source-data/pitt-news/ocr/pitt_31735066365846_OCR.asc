For an editorial on the adminis-
tration's PIRG decision, see page
four.

The Chancellor’s office re-
ceived phone calls today

from PIRG supporters urging ;

the Chancellor to meet with
PIRG representatives to re-
view the recent administrative
refusal to act as collection
agent for PIRG fees.

The callers also requested PIRG
be given an opportunity to present
its proposal at the next Board
of Trustees meeting March 14.

’70’s strategy

Despite PIRG’s accumulation

of more than 9,000 signatures on
petitions asking the administra-
tion to act as a conduit for PIRG
funds. the administration has re-

fused on the basis of questionable .
responsibil- V

legality, fiduciary
ities, and the matter of precedent.

PIRG supporters have counter-
ed that PIRG’s status as an inde-
pendent corporation relieves the
University of liability and that
precedent for University funding
of organizations has already been
set.

Vice Chancellor for Operations
Joseph Dutton presented the Uni-
versity‘s rationale to PIRG work-

er Linda Varrenti in a Feb. 7 let-
ter:

 . . Our attorneys advise us it
would be improper for the Univer-
sity to act as an agent for collec-
tion of the proposed fees,” he said.

TRUSTEE ACCOUNTABILITY
Dutton contended that because
the Trustees are accountable for
the use of funds they collect,
"they may not authorize these
funds to be spent by outside or-
_ganizations whose activities they
neitherdirect or audit.”

Var renti argues that Pitt "would
not have to be responsible” for
PIRG expenditures because PIRG
is an independent corporate en-
tity. ,

The administration " is 1- “raising
the legal issues to cloud the
area,” says PIRG lawyer, Bern-
ard Marcus.

"‘The Trustees are accountable '

for funds they collect for the Uni-
versity. but I don't think Trustees
are accountable for all funds they
collect." Marcus said. "If the
University acts as a conduit for
PIRG it should not be held re-

Postman offers education reforms

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Our public schools "are not
working and cannot work as they
are presently constructed,” re-
marked Neil Postman to kick off
the Encounter II education con-
ference last Friday evening.

The co-author of Teaching as a.
Subversive Activity and The Soft
Revolution outlined a seven point
proposal as “an attempt to-des-
cribe a kind of game plan for the
70's."

Calling for the “elimination of
procedures," Postman proposed
modeling schools as convivial
communities. maintaining an at-
mosphere of warmth and accep-
tance in institutions run by what
he termed “people like us."

“We must eliminate or drastic-
ally change the grading system,”

   
 

 

Supporters of the Public
Interest Research ‘ Group
(PIRG) will gather at an

‘important meeting Wednes-
day night.

POSTMAN AT ENCOUNTER ll: “Children are better teachers than adults.”

.he argued, “which forces even the

youngest (child) into unholy com-
petition and acceptance of cheat-
ing as a virtue.”

In line with this policy, Post-
man advocated the abolition of
homogeneous grouping, as well as
detailing the need to “let' all stu-
dents know what their civil rights
are."

Since grades may eventually af-
fect earning ability. he said, low
marks in a sense constitute libel-
ous statements. In one instance. a
teacher was even being sued after
assigning a student a low grade.
he noted.

The second point “concerns

adopting serious responsibility for
thegemotional life of children.”
Toward this end, Postman sug-
gested the adoption of the study
of feelings as a legitimate aca-
demic subject.

Less concern

ed to stop at the PIRG office

regarding time and

achievement than on feelings
about the self as a learner, he
said.

Another of Postman‘s priorities
involves the "extension of the con-
cept of literacy” and a reconsi-
deration of the “present definition
of intellectual competence.

ability are not necessarily re-
lated," Postman pointed out. of-
fering the concept of "multi me-
dia literacy."

Thus, he said, competence could
be demonstrated in any of a num-
ber of areas, including film and
video tape. ‘—

Postman also advocated less
crowded schools; Citing the "law
of group ecology." he said that
once beyond a certain size. class-
es "deteriorate into a group bu-
reaucracy." Discovering maxi-

.mum and optimum class num-
bers would be one step toward a
solution. he stated.

Postman asked for an "expand-
ed definition of the concept of
learning.” to devise and experi-
ment with the learning environ-
ment, and testing the validity of
theoretical constructs in alterna-
tive schools.

An additional alternative might
be to “take students out of schools
altogether,” suggested Postman.

"Learning should not be sep-

arated from action." he argued..

"It is necessary to arrange
things so that students can really

be involved in social and political .

life." stated Postman.

The final point involves getting
"significant people into school as
teachers regardless of creden-
tials." Almost anyone capable of
conveying some valuable learning
experie/nce could be acceptable.
noted Postman.

He cited studies indicating that
“children are better teachers
than adults, and learn more when
they are teaching.”

"America is presently wasting
its most effective group of teach-
ers." concluded Postman.

Another reason for the Univer-

sity veto, Dutton said, was the.

Two speeches Saturday. one praising and one criticizing the so—call- '

ed Jesus revival, highlighted a weekend symposium on the movement.

In a speech entitled “Stop the World. I Want to Get Off” Joseph
Garlington, a minister at large from Penn Hills, said, “The world IS a 
a trip and if you stay on too long you won’tf1nd yourself.”

_ People become so compressed into a way of thinking that they

want to get out of it. he explained.

"Then someone passed out literature and we have had a ‘spiritual
restoration. The Jesus people have seen it and» have said "Stop the.

world I want to get off," he said.

Garlington depicted the world today as inia state of impending. ‘

doom.

“I don’t know if you know how reckless the world is. It is on a di- 

s.

rect collision with trouble,” he commented.

According to Garlington, the world’s woes stem from constantly _'
succumbing to society's temptations. If people are to overcome these; ht

temptations. he said. they must first realize they exist.

“The first thing we have to see is the devil is all around us in this.
world.“ he said. "The system is going to fail because it is under the

power of the evil one.’

Lowell Streiker, a Temple University Ph.D., viewed the Jesus

movement more harshly.

“Basically we are dealing with a groupthat is based on mass emo- : 

tion and not objective viewing." he said.

The people in the movement are looking for something emotional

rather than ethical or intellectual, commented Streiker. " .__

‘ .

“Instead of building a stable society the Jesus freaks are getting”

aboard an ark,” said Streiker.

The majority of Jesus freaks lack a sense of responsibility and 

citizenship, he_ added.

fl-For almost two hours Saturday
night, Jeanne Frein, an educa-
tor with the New School for Be-
havioral Studies, discussed the
concept of the open class-
room.

Finally, a somewhat skeptical
‘member of the audience asked
the most important question ‘con.-
cerning. the new teaching meth-

schools compare with those from

conventional schools? I

"The teacher more than the
student makes the difference in
whether it works or not,” she
said.“’I‘hey need time to make
the transition."

Frein compared “a _teacher’s
function in an open classroom
and a parent’s function in an
open home.” -

She said that the open class-
room ‘,‘doesn’t apply to every-
body.” A teacher must decide
which approach to use with each
child in each subject area, she
said, and sometimes conven-
tional methods are best for cer-
tain students.

Subverting Them

Although Frein holds no de-
gree in education (she has a B.A.
in English and a post—graduate
degree in Theology), right now
she “can’t imagine doing any-
thing else” but teaching.

Four years ago, before her in-
volvement with the New School,
Frein taught in a conventional
elementary school. Her philoso-
phy at thetime was: “.1 wish I

She also said that the PIRG
proposal of an optional fee on the

POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Kathy Kadane, PIRG coordina-
tor, has stated the University is
suffering from "hysteria.” She
indicated that Pitt administrators
fear losing state subsidies.

Although this rationale did not
appear in Dutton’s memo, Coble
said the University always risks
"incurring the ire of the state and
losing funds when you get- into
partisan politics.”

Because of Pitt's relationship~

to the state, Coble said. "we can-—
not channel funds into something
of a political character.” Though‘
PIRG claims to be non-partisan,
he theorized that its goals will
eventually cause it to enter the
political arena.

Even by simply acting as a fee
collecting, Coble said, the Univer-
sity lends “the coloration of con-
doning the activity.”

Dutton, however, denies that
this reason entered the Universi-
ty’s decision making process.

"Our state-relatedness of the.
University as opposed to the re-
lationships of other private uni-I
versities, did not enter into the
decision that was made.”

TRUSTEE DECISION
PIRG members say they were
led to believe that the final deci-
sion would be made not by admin-

A istrators, but by the Trustees.

They further contend they were

Alfred Move.

Dutton argued that the mem-
bers misunderstood the letter,

Petition circulated I  

‘for Women’s Studies

. by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

Faced with a possible crumb-
ling of their efforts to institute a V
Women’s Studies program, the
Undergraduate Wom_en’s Union
decided at a Wednesday night
meeting to circulate a petition
gathering student support for the
program.

Union member Cathy Davis ex-
plained to the small gathering
that the difficulties stemmed
from the priority decisions of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS). '

_ Davis said that, according to
FAS" Dean Dr. Jerome Rosen-
berg, the Freshman Studies Pro-

.gram, already passed by the
-FAS'..', would receive financial

priority.

Previously, Davis stated, the
original hiring resolution passed
by the FAS called for the selection
of five new faculty members.

ed proceedings to find five people

said, reserved the right to refuse

with the proper qualifications.

Because the Freshman Studies‘
Program is to receive priority,
Davis continued, the committee
has been told to think in terms of
three, not five faculty members.

“I, myself,Z’ Davis said, “can—
not see how a program can be de-
veloped with only three people.
Something must be done—Wom-
en’s Studies will crumble if we
don’t get the five.”

Jan Miller, a member of the
group, noted that, since the Uni-
versity budget has not yet been
prepared, the most important
thing is to show sufficient sup-
port to prevent the programs be-
ing cut in half.

Davis stressed that the efforts
of the Undergraduate Women‘s
Union should not be construed as
an attempt at undermining Fresh-
man Studies, but merely a propos-
al for the reshuffling of time and
energy.

Those present at the meeting
recommended a visit to Rosen-
berg and Provost Rhoten Smith
to present the group’s grievances.

'  ,' With startling impunity, the administration
?'has defied the wishes of a majority of the stu-
; dentbody.

In an extraordinary display of student solidar-
.over 9,000 Pitt undergraduates signed peti-
-ftions" calling for the establishment of a Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG) chapter at Pitt,
, through a refundable $2 per term addition to the
."invoice. -

. Despite this virtually unparalleled expression
a of student unity, the administration has vetoed the
petitioner's'plea, blatantly disregarding student
 opinion.

' The administration reached its decision last
month, with the blessing of the Board of Trustees.
,No one represented PIRG at the Board meeting
 or advanced PIRG’s side of the case.

_ Now, PIRG’s backers are asking for the right
3»-to appeal to the Board of Trustees‘ at its March
, 14 meeting.

 _~"‘lThis,is a request." that will be refused only
by an intransigent administration.

At the very least, the PIRG people, represent-
ing a majority of the student body, should have
 the right of appeal. . , .
. In justifying its decision, the administration
has clutched at straws, offering excuses that are
flimsy at best. '

According to Ray Coble, Executive Assistant
to the Chancellor,‘ the administration made its de-
: cision for several reasons. The administration al-
_ leges: ‘

y; 1) (That the University, because of its fiduciary
"responsibilities, cannot collect money for a group
‘it does not control;

;. 2) that adding a $2 per term PIRG fee to the

=invoice would jeopardize the University’s tax-

exempt status because PIRG is "political“ in
"nature;

I 3) that a viable mechanism for funding PIRG
;-—through the Student Activities Fee—already ex-

-~istS.;

, , 4) that adding a $2 per term PIRG fee to the
invoice would set a dangerous precedent; and

 - 5) that billing costs for PIRG would be prohib-
gitive. _ I
I All the above arguments are specious.

First of all, the University does collect money
‘ for groups it does not control in the areas of in-
’ siirance and food service.

i  . The University is already serving as a conduit
.’for funds which provide services to the student
‘body. Thus, funding PIRG would not represent
“a dramatic departure from current procedure.

 _ ‘ Second, the University’s tax-exempt status would
,.t_§ot be jeopardized by the addition of $2 per term
 BIRG fee to the invoice. 1

 In other states (Minnesota, Vermont, and Ore-
éon); PIRG chapters have been established under

niversity auspices, and in no instance has a uni-
§§ersity’s tax-exempt status been jeopardized.

*:.l . .
1’ The danger, in short, is a manufactured one.

Besides, if the University’s arrangement with
PIRG
the IRS, the University could easily sever connec-
it'i,’ons with PIRG.

,_ ‘.‘Even if the IRS decided against the arrange-
fr1ent,” PIRG lawyer Bernard Marcus notes. “they
liioluld first tell the Universitv that its tax status

iiyvas in jeopardy.”
'  The PIRG organizers are prepared to sign a
contract with the University freeing the Univer-
sity of all responsibilities to PIRG if its tax-exempt
"Status should be jeopardized.

.1 This escape batch is ample, and the adminis-
._ tration’s reference to non-existent legal prob-
’,-lems serves only to camouflage the real issues
-“involved. '

=1 . Third, it is true that a possible funding me-
chanism for PIRG - namely, the Student Activi-
ties Fee - does exist. ‘

However, the Student Activities Fee is coer-
' cive, whereas the PIRG fee would not be. Any
‘student who did not support PIRG would be eli-

gible for a full no-questions-asked refund. In
'  contrast, Activities Fee payments are not refund-
able. ,
__vMoreover, if PIRG is to have a firm footing.
it cannot be subject to the whims of ‘Student
Governments.

This is not to say that PIRG should be per-
,anentlypfunded./When a majority of‘ students
"monstra‘te theirppposition to PIRG by securing

their $2 refund, PIRG should be abolished or
handled differently.

But a PIRG dependent on Student Activities

i Fee‘ money for its existence is a PIRG doomed to

relative impotence. As PIRG enthusiast Linda
Varrenti puts it, “What they’re doing is asking us
to be ineffective.”

Fourth, adding a $2 per term‘ PIRG fee to the

‘ invoice would not set a dangerous precedent.

In raisingvthe specter of groups flocking to
the University and asking for a similar arrange-
ment, the administration is playing a cute hypo-
thetical game.

But even. if the groups should stampede the
University. so what?

If a group obtains the support of the student
body and is prepared to pay for billing expenses.
why shouldn’t the University serve as a conduit?

This prospect is highly unlikely, but insofar
as the PIRG setup might set a precedent. it
would not be a dangerous one.

Moreover, the precedent of financing a stu-

dent activity through a means other than the Stu-
dent Activities Fee has already been set by the
Chancellor, who decided several years ago to

fund the“Black Action Society through the Pro-

vost’s office rather than through Student Govern-
ment. .

Finally, it is difficult to estimate the cost of
additional billing procedures to accommodate
PIRG because Vice Chancellor of Operations Jo-
seph Dutton has yet to provide P_IRGrV's backers
with a detailed, substantiated cost estimate.

However, this concern should not worry the
administration, since PIRG’s organizers have of-
fered to underwrite additional billing costs, should
the University decide that the costs are pro-
hibitive.

Actually, the administrations arguments are
rationalizations obscuring the real reason for
the administration's decision— fear of PIRG it-
self.

The fact of the matter is that PIRG would be- I
come an institutionalized gadfly under Univer--

sity auspices.

While many of PIRG’s activities would be
beneficial to all sectors of the community (ob-
taining better statistical indicators of pollution

levels, for example), some of PIRG’s activities

would place various groups on the spot.

Among groups that might be challenged by
PIRG are state legislators and corporate execu-

tives, both of. whom provide the University with

financial support.

The administration is undoubtedly afraid that.

PIRG might arouse the ire of wealthy financiers
and powerful state legislators, who might un-
leash their fury by taking reprisals against the
University. .

Kathy Kadane of PIRG appropriately la_bels
this attitude 'fhysteria” and those familiar with
the administration are well aware of how easily
the phrases “State Legislature“ and “corporate
executives” trigger this response.

Ultimately, it boils down to whether or not
the University will take the risk of providing
technical assistance to a group devoted to commun-
ity betterment which may spotlight the malprac-
tices or foot-dragging of powerful people.

The Pitt News believes that such risks must be
taken. .

It is proper for the administration to consider
the sensibilities of state legislators and corporate
executives.

But it is improper for the administration to
capitulate to them.

And it is absurd for the administration to make
policy.on the basis of an anticipated vindictive-

ness which may very well exist only in the minds
of the administration.

PIRG may ’very well step on some toes, but‘

capable administrators would be able to make a
case for PIRG’s right to do so. if the student bodv
supportsit. "

Traditionally, risk-taking has been portraved
as irresponsi-bility. ‘‘

But this University, will

Student Government
aims toward credibility

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD

What do you do when you find yourself a newly elected
Student Government Board member with a new constitution, a
new government structure and a student body consensus that
student government is a complete travesty?

You try harder. which is exactly what the new Board members
are doing.

Board members are allrelatively new to government. A few
have had limited experience in Men‘s Dorm Council or fraternity
government.

, All are relatively uninitiated to the problems of co-operation
and procedure. The Board members seemed almost buoyantly ideal-
istic at their first meetings.

Maybe a little awed with the responsibility, their discussion
was frequently weighed down with trivialities and formalities.

Organization left a lot to be desired and time was lost reading
proposals and policies.

It took only a few meetings for the board members to get fed
up with some members not "doing -their homework.“ Getting the
meetings underway because of late arrivals was another problem.

Motions were made urging diligence in reading memos on
Board business before the meetings so that discussion could begin
without wasting time. Agreements were voiced about the necessity
of starting meetings promptly. .

There are still a few problems with late arrivals. One Board
member seems to have an irregular sense of direction.

But the reading and re-reading of issues has ended.

The meetings as yet have failed to generate any real student
interest. Peak attendance has been four students and even that is
misleading since two were there on behalf of _organizations dealt
with at the meeting. ' «

Maybe the studen_t_body is waiting /for a bulletin rapping the

wild, table-standing, circus-like atmosphere‘ often rumored to be‘

typical of the last student government’s meetings.
If so, students are likely to be disappointed.

The new SG is to be commended .for its ease of fitting into the
groove. They have accomplished a lot of the basic groundwork in
their first month but they still
have quite a long way to go.

Co—operation is achieved by
anlinformal courtesy rule and
no-one seems to mind when the
President finds him outof order

ended and moves on to new business.

Procedure is haphazard at times but generally. formal enough
to require order and respect for the floor.

It seems the new student government is very. much concerned
about the natural compa.rison to the previous SG, which was an ob-
ject of scorn in many circles.

They seem to be aiming at establishing credibility in student
government.

If current trends continue, they just may succeed.

A large percentage of the people in the movmentfas many as 90
per cent are former “druggers or dopers," said Streiker.

He said that many of the teenagers wanting to get into the move- ..

ment lie about their former involvement in drugs. The deeper they
were into drugs before they were saved, he said, the better status they

have in the group.

Streiker said that those involved in the movement are from the.

middle and lower classes and minority groups. Specifically. he found a
large number of Jews in the movement.

Involved in the movement when he was 15. Streiker said he grew

disillusioned as he aged. I

"The interpretation of reality that I had at 15 or 16," he said. "is

no longer adequate at 15."

Streiker based his assumptions on interviews with hundreds of
Jesus freaks. He lived among them for two weeks.

"Nose holders’ plug. new musicli

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
I Entertainment Editor

"A Month of New Music,"
our music department’s "pro-
motion” of the latest in avant
.garde, has finally arrived» and
has already proven itself with

its first concert Thursday to be .

t

"all things to all men.“

I sa-y “all things” because of
the utter impossibility of any
listener to retain any sort of
indifference to this “music.“
after hearing it, or if you prefer,
after being subjected to it.

To the progressive looking for i

new sounds and media, a pro-
gram dedicated to new percus-
sion music (as this program was)
must seem like ambrosia sent
from Olympus. On the other

‘ hand, to the orthodox music lover
who feels that music ceased to
be written after 1900, the mad-
ness that takes place in the con-
cert hall on occasions such as
_this leaves the head aching and
the mind searching for the mean-
ing of the whole mess-.

.,In former years, the persus-
sionist was largely relegated to
the place of the underdog as far
as musicianship was concerned
but the new music ‘movement’
has changedall that.

Now, as this concert certain-
ly testified, the percussionist
has become the most important
piece in the entire new music
“puzzle.” Getting as many un-
usual sounds as possible out of
vibraphones, bells, drums, and

‘ pianos is the-composers'plan and
the percussionist has become the

\masterbuilder in regard to the
blueprint.

composers‘ intentions across to

I  ._.Although Morgantown, W. Va., is only 80 or so miles south
‘ of Pittsburgh, it may as well be a thousand. When youreach
West Virginia, you just know you’re in a different part of the
country. ‘
 Maybe it’s the condition of the road immediately after
i, crossing the Pa’.—W.Va.» border; maybe it’s the drawl of _the peo-
< pie thatpass you on the street; or maybe it’s the lack of some-.

f_.lack of class. Class is a hard thing to define; it’s something you
sense about a place, something you can feel about a person.
, When I walked into the ultra-modern WVU Coliseum, the cup-
’. cake shaped edifice which houses the Mountaineers, I couldn’t
help but be impressed. It didn’t take long for the fascination to
wear off.

With the Pitt Cubs-Little Mounties game in progress I took
my seat. The Little Mountaineers were leading, 64-60. An an-
nouncement came over the loudspeaker. “According the West
xVirginia rules, all freshmen games must be over by 7:30. If
..-they’re not, then running time will prevail for the remainder of
: the game after 7: 30, through foul call and time-outs.”

_ No sooner had theannouncement ceased than did the Little
: Mountie Coach Chuck Windsor call a time-out. As precious sec-
onds ticked away (80 of them). the WVU freshmen, stood around"
" discussing strategy. _
"We agreed to the rule before the game, but the first time
I leard that time-outs were a part of this was when they made
the announcement," indicated the Cubs’ incensed Coach Tim

V’

the question here. How can you call a time out? Now that's bush.

i . Winning is certainly a cruciallvariable in any rivalry and
'- as WVU Head Coach Sonny Moran put it, “We told Chuck we

 classless method, somehow questions the sophistication of a
_school. ' - ’

“He calls a time-out and says he’s changing defenses,"
f commented Grgurich, “and then comes out in the same defense.
; What’s he think, were stupid?”

_ , And so the list of abuses continue, as irritating and trying
as the evening was long. Fans throwing ice filled cups on the

._' , after they had committed fouls or missed shots, near-sighted
/7‘? " referees missing violations all over the court, and Sonny Moran
C beaming about how they "had it done," all added to the over-all
 V impression which pervaded the Coliseum.

;~ I guess, as the season draws to a close, injustice should be
 the theme of Pitt's last basketball game. The Panthers have
been forced to endure some of the most overt “homers” in col-
,_‘ ‘ lege basketball this year. At the same time, Pitt fans complain
6'" that the Cats don’t even get a fair shake on their own home
court. Where the guilt lies is hard.to say, but an equalizer must
be instituted to take the power to win or lose away from the refs.

 

.A WVU fan commented after the freshmen game, "You
take ’em anyway you can get ’em,” but somehow there’s more to
itthan that.

All-American status before Saturday night’s Pitt-
West Virginia game should have changed their

-minds after WVU‘s 104-90 victory in the finalefor

1971-72.

Robinson delighted the ‘greater portion of the
9,000 plus crowd (which included several hundred
Pitt loyalists) at WVU’s beautiful -Coliseum with a
42 point performance to conclude a brilliant ca-
reer for the Mountaineers.

In the waning moments ofthe game he co_n—
verted two free throws which allowed him to sur-
pass Jerry West’s all-time season scoring average

_ mark at WVU with a 29.4 mark, another stellar ac- .

complishment.

Robinson, whoﬁmoves to his right with great
alacrity and speed, I-canned 12 of his points dur-

ing a crucial period in the second half when the ,

Mounties upped a one point lead to 13, with‘ 10

minutes left. .
From then on, the Panthers (12-12) tried

valiantly to cut the lead but the high scoring

WVU offense didn’t allow the Cats to get any clos-

er than 10 poin-ts. -

‘fRobinson definitely played his best game
ever against us," admitted Pitt ‘Coach Buzz Ridl‘
"He got the key baskets when we needed them."
agreed an elated WVU Coach Sonny Moran.

Robinson’s 42 points were undoubtably brutal
to the Panthers’ but seven footer Mike Heitz’ 24
tallies proved devastating. Though not a great of-
fensive threat, Heitzwas able to take many lob
passes over the Cat defenders for easy layups.

Several Panthers alternated on the flat-
footed Heitz—first Billy Knight, then Bill Sulkow-
ski and Paul O’Gorek. Heitz also ‘collected 15 re-
bounds, high in the game. Ridl chose to have his
defense front Heitz, trying for intercepted
passes, but the strategy was rarely successful.

Moran attributed his squad’s second half surge

to a switch in defense. ‘After using a 2-3 zone the ‘
first period, he assigned man—to-man coverage on"

Mike Paul (16) and Kent Scott (22). and zoned the
rest of the Panthers.

Knight (20) suffered a bad eye injury at the
start of the second half and missed several min-
utes of action. Ironically, without Knight, the
Panthers cut a six point lead to one, but upon
his re-entry, the Mountaineers hit their hot spell
and broke the game open.

Bill finished the season with a plus 20 point
scoring average, the first in years for a Panther.
Additionally, hisseason shooting percentage was
over 54 per cent, breaking Kent Scott’s old Pitt rec-
ord of 52 per cent.

The victory for WVU gave themla 13-11 record,
a fine accomplishment considering the squad lost
five players through the course of the season.

For the second time in Buzz Ridl’s four year

stint at Pitt, the Panthers concluded their sea-

son at ‘.500 with the 12-12 mark.

In the closing minutes of the game, the Pan-
thers’ concern for Robinson’s shot proved costly.
On several occasions, other Mountaineers were

For a while, the Panthers managed to play even
with the Mounties in their run and shoot offense, un-
til Robinson did what he does best—shooting the
eyes out of the basket enroute to his All-American
acclaim. .

The freshmen were beaten, agreed Coach
Tim Grgurich but WVU’s tactics remain ques-
tionable (see column). One thing’s for sure,
time did run out. I

The Mountaineers, reputed to have one of the
finest frosh teams in their history, avenged an ear-
lier defeat at the hands of Tim Grgurich’s hustling
hoopers, 13-5. this year.

Guard Rick Coles had a brilliant game in lead-
ing the West Virginians. Coles scored a game high
[of 24 points and also had eight rebounds.

The Pitt track team was hoping
to play the part of the spoiler this
past weekend but a few unexpect-
ed twists of fate quickly shatter-
ed that dream as Pitt landed in
seventh place in the 51st IC4Al
Track and Field championship.

"Everything‘happened to us. it
was just one of those days." com-

mented Pitt’s Coach Jim Banner _ _ 
on the weekend's contest in_ ‘

Princeton, as Penn upset Villa-

_ nova, 26-24, to break the Wildcats’

five-year winning streak.

"The (Pitt) boys really tried
hard, but it was just one of those
days when they couldn‘t get -the
breaks. They did a heck of a job,
they just weren’t getting the
breaks which are. needed in that
k-ind of meet." '

members of the team have run to-
gether as a group.

Mickey Collins, Bob ‘Steele,
John Black, and Ken Silay, the
two-mile relay team, ran into
catastrophe when Steele fell
and landed on his shoulder and
knee which prevented the team
from completing the race.

"Bill did a great job in the
long jump," related Banner. "I
was disappointed in his perform-
ance in the triple jump but I
guess it was just a combination

‘of lack of experience and just

trying so hard.” Rea failed to
place in the event.

The other Pitt tracksters who
placed in the meet was Steve Hein
who finished fourth in the shot put
event with a 56-4.

Over-all Pitt was only able to
collect 10 points which was far
below the amount the tracksters

But strong swimming by Penn
