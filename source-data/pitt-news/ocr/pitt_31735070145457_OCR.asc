Google Fiber  
not for dorms

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Pittsburgh might win a contest to get
one of the fastest Internet networks
in history, but for Pitt students living
on campus, that might mean almost
nothing. .

Google, the Internet search giant,
announced on its public blog earlier
this month that it intends to create
a network with 1-gigabit—per—second
speed — several times what is avail-
able through other companies — for
a U.S. city. Pittsburgh and other U.S.
cities jumped into the contest, “Google
Fiber for Communities,” for a chance
to win the high-speed network.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
spoke up aswell. He posted amessage
on my.pitt.edu and sent an e-mail last
week, encouraging students to recom-
mend Pittsburgh for the network.

But Pitt provides the Internet ac-
cess for the dormitories and the Uni-
versity itself. So all of that speed won’t
be coming to a Pitt dorm, even if the
city does win.

Morgan Kelly, aspokesmanfor Pitt,
said that if Google’s network came to
Pittsburgh, itwould bringno change to
students inthe dorms. Neitherwould
the super-fast Internet connection
come to the University as-a whole.

of one to 10 megabytes per second.

That’s about one hundredth of the

speed offered by the Google contest.
Fiber-optic Internet connections

offered byVen'zon reach 50 megabytes ‘

per second, according to Verizon’s
website. ,

Googlewquld offerthe service ata
“competiﬁve price” to at least5o,000
people and potentially 500,000, ac-
cording to the company’s blog.

The mayor of Duluth, Minn.,
jumped into Lake Superior as part of
the city’s bid for the Google network.
Topeka, Kan., renamed itself“Google,
Kansas” for the month of March. But
somethinglike“Googlesburgh”is not
in the works for the city.

Joarma Doven, a spokeswoman
for Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, said the
city wasn’t looking for anything that
drastic yet. i

Ravenstahl declared last Friday —
the contest’s registration deadline —
“Google Day” in Pittsburgh. People
lined up on Forbes Avenue, Down-
town, that day to spell out “Google,”
holding signs saying “Reserved For
Google” with alawn chair on it.

The sign, which is also on the
website, serves as the city’s logo for
the contest. The lawn chair is some-
thing distinctly Pittsburgh — Doven
said it comes from the practice of
Pittsburghers putting lawn chairs

Students take a hike on the campaign trail

Despite meager statistics of political involvement, some Pitt studentswork to elect candidates for Pennsylvania governor.

Michael Macagnone

Senior Staff Writer -

Charles “Chazz” Aden remembers
walkingaroundhis house withaGore/
Lieberman button on his chest during
the 2000 presidential election.

' Ever since then, politics have in-
trigued Aden, a PitI freshman studying
history and political science.

Several hundred miles separate
Aden from his home in northern New

Jersey. But nothing— not even 10 years
of passing time — can separate him
ﬁ'om politics.

“It’s whatl do,” Aden said. “I never
even thought about not being active
here.”

Aden works for the gubernatorial
campaign of Democrat Joe Hoeffel,
the current Montgomery County com-
missioner. Even though he’s not reg-
istered to vote in Pennsylvania, Aden
couldn’t imagine not being involved
in campaigns. 1' .

ButAden does notfollowthe trends
his generation has set. Statistics show
that few college-aged students vote in
primary elections or join Pitt political
organizations. This is despite the fact
that several campaign employees say
college-aged studentswillplayaninte-
gral role in their work as they prepare
for the state’s primary elections, which
will be held May 18. Some volunteers
even turn. their work into ﬁill-time
jobs. C

An (almost) no-show genera-
tion

Moststudents do notbecomepoliti—
cally active incollege, butthosewho do
tend to go at it full force.

Turnout among young voters is

, lowerthananyotherdemographic,and

tumout rates on Pitt’s campus were less

than 10 percent in the last election.

Lessthanspercent ofthe morethan
3,600 people registered to vote in the
area including Bouquet Street and the
Forbes QuadranglevotedinNovember
2009, when people chose their mayor
and other local representatives.

Less than 1 percent of the students
on Pitt’s campus are actively involved
in the Pit College Republicans or the
Pitt Collge Democrats.

AliciaHarris, the program director
forthe Pitt College Democrats, said that
the club has about 50 active members
and that about20 ofthemwork on gu-

bernatorial orsenatorial campaigns at

any given time.

Rachel Feinstein, president of the’

Pitt College Republicans, said that she
sees between 30 and 35 students at
most of their meetings. Her club sup-
portedAttomeyGeneralTomCorbett’s
campaignforgovemor. State Rep. Sam
Rohrer, R-128th, isalso runningforthe
Republican nomination.

Since the College Republicans en-
dorsed Corbett, they have focused on
working on individual events rather
than on campaigns, Feinstein said.
Ten to 15 people might volunteer for
a campaign event that the club hears
about, she said.

College-aged students, or at least ‘

those at Pitt, appearto be less involved
inpoliticsthan members of older gen-
erations. ‘

Just prior to the 2008 presidential
election, when Democratic candidates
were heavily courting young voters,
people ages 18 to 24 had the lowest
tumout rate of any age group, at 48
percent, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau website. People ages 25 to 44
hadthe nextlowest rates, at60 percent.
Voters o1derthan65 hadaturnout rate
of more than 65 percent.

“Ifwejust voted in the same num-
bersas those over 65,” Aden said, “we

could change the government.” 1

_ All this occurs despite the fact that
campaigns rely heavily on college vol-
unteers. *
' - ' Matt Merriman-Preston, Hoeﬂ°el’s

' Western Pennsylvaniacoordinator, said

about 70 percent of their volunteers
are college-aged. Preston, who began
working in politics as a student, said
that volunteering  “more fun than
stressﬁil” for students.

Student volunteers can make “a
huge impactonthe community,” Pres-
ton ~ —

Anexceptiontothe low-turnout
rule‘ ' .

Aden spends much of his time on
the Hoeffel campaign doing door-to-
door canvassing, makingphone calls,
organizingphone banks andﬁllingout
paperwork. .

His work is similar to that ofthe
people who volunteer for Corbett by

blowing up balloons or handing out

pamphlets, Feinstein said.

Aden, a Democrat, grewup i_nMor-
ris County, N.]., where current Gov.
Chris Christie, a Republican, won by
more than 25 percent in the last elec-

-tion. For Aden, it was strange to vote

as an absentee after being so heavily
involved in his hometown polities.

“It feltweird not workingin acam-
paign in November,” Aden said.

Aden ﬁrst volunteered with John
Kerry’s presidentialcampaignin2004,

and the next year he volunteered for .

Democrat Thom ]ackson’s campaign
for the Newjersey State Assembly. Over
the next few years, Aden worked on a
number of campaigns —— local, state
and federal —— before coming to Pitt.
Growing up inaheavily Republican
district made him “appreciate the vic-
tories we could g ” Working on the
campaigns tied his and his fellow vol-

unteers’ emotions tightlyto the results,
Aden said.

“We learned to associate election

After practice comes the pay

Some students who have worked
likeAdenhas have turned their intern-
ships and volunteer work into jobs.

’ Pitt senior Aleigha Cavalier began

.working for Allegheny County Ex-

ecutive Dan Onorato as an intern in
October 2008 and was hired for the
gubematorial campaignlastDecember.
She currently serves as the operations
manager for his campaign, handling

the purchase and shipping of ofﬁce *
supplies and coordinating communi-‘"

caﬁons between the campaign’s four
regional oﬁices. She also supervises

' and hires the interns that work in the

Pittsburgh oﬁice, all but two of whom
are college-aged.

. The staff furnished the campaign a

office with temporary furniture. Each

office door had a paper sheet taped ‘

outside with the occupants name on

it. All of the staffers work on laptops
that rest on the folding tables they use
for desks.

The intemsworkinaseries ofparti-
tions inthe middle ofthe oflice.Alarge
section of wall holds taped sheets of
paperwiththe names ofPennsylvania’s
counties. '

The entire campaign could come

to a halt if Onorato loses the primary _

in May. It could also run through the
November general election. Cavalier
said she hasn’t thought about what
she might do if Onorato loses the pri-
mary. .

Whileworkingonacampaignmight
justbe aforrn ofvolunteeringfor others,

it is different for her.

“’I‘his is the ﬁrst job of my career,” -

she said.

Cavalier still has a ﬁill class load.
She works in Onorato’s office during
the day and takes most of her classes
at night.

, The campaign and classes could get
a little crazy, but the hectic lifestyle of a
campaign worker doesn’t always slow
downafter graduation.

Ashley Chunko graduated from
Kutztown University in eastern Penn-

sylvania this past May. She has been .

working On Attorney General Tom
Corbett’s campaign sincejune.

Her job grew out of an internship.
She interned for a semester in Cor-
bett’s office her senior year. When she
graduated and the internship ended,
the campaign hired her.

" “Icouldn’tthinkofabet1:erﬁrstjob,”

-‘she said. . ' -

The job has grown to ﬁll the space

- classwork left behind. ‘‘It’s a seven-

days—a-Week, always-on—call kind of

Pitt close to meeting goals for university recycling competition

Schools across the nation compete in RecycleMania, an effort to reduce campus waste.

Olivia Garber
Staﬁ’Wri ter

Pitt ended its waste—reduction com-
petition last week andthinks it might
have come close to meeting its goal

" of recycling 15 pounds of material’
’ per person.

The University has yet to conﬁg-
ure its ﬁnal. data from the 10-week
RecycleMania competition, which
ended Friday, but it has recycled an
average of 1.47 pounds of material
per student, staff and faculty mem-
ber on campus since RecycleMania
beganjan. 17, bringing the projected
total to 13.24 pounds per person.

Pitt students and faculty mem-
bers placed additional recycling con-

V tainers across campus for the Recy-

cleMania competition, in which 607
schools across the nation competed
to see who could help the environ-
ment the most. Of those schools, 382

chose to formally compete against .

each other in ﬁve categories: Grand

Champion, Per Capita, Gorilla Prize, .
Targeted Material and Waste Mini-

mization. The ﬁrst four focus on
the amount of material recycled,
but Waste Minimization focuses on
reducing and reusing. The winner of
the category will have produced the
least amount of ‘municipal waste.
The non-competing chose to par-
ticipate simply to conserve.
‘ Alec Cooley, program manager
for RecycleMania, which is spon-

Sony Rane, a senior environmen-

‘ tal studies and business dual major at

Pitt, worked with Facilities Manage-

University Recycling Council, said

that it takes multiple sources to re-'

Recycling is something that’s easy
and accessible to many people, but
RecycleMania attempts to encourage
reduction as well, hence the waste
minimization category, he said. ‘ .

they placed more than 100 boxes
in dorms, Rane said. i

The boxes, made of recyclable
material, are white to make them
more visible, Rane said. Pitt also
has brown plastic containers for
recycling, butpmore receptacles

were needed to accommodate Re-

cycleMania.

Both containers counted toward
the RecycleMania statistics.
RecycleMania’s website will post

"the ﬁnal results April 16, but until

then, Free the Planet co-president
Seth Bush estimates that Pitt will be
pretty close to the goal of 15 pounds
per capita. Free the Planet is a stu-
dent organization that focuses on
awareness about important envi-

Tabiing is not i s effective as we’d like on Pitt’s

campus. People put on the horse blinders and just

ronmental issues. V
A Rane said this year’s participa-
tion is not really comparable to last

‘year’s because Pitt is actually com-

peting this year. Last year, Pitt was
in the Benchmark Division and was
not competing for any prizes. Last
year’s results were also calculated
per student, instead of per capita,

though the goal was equivalent: 15
pounds per student. With a total of
21.69 pounds per student, Pitt well
exceeded its goal.

Laura Zullo, senior manager of

capital and special projects with the
department of Facilities Manage-
ment, said Facilities Management
was responsible for collecting and
measuringthe material as well as re-
porting the results to RecycleMania.
While some statistics were estimates
based on the size of containers and
the number of times the contain-
ers were emptied, certain materials
like paper were actually'measured,
Zullo said.

Facilities Management left the
publicity of the event to Free the

V Planet, Zullo said.

Bush said Free the Planet began
promoﬁng RecycleMania in early
September. The group began by ta-
bling at various locations — includ-
ing wrestling games — but looked
for other ways when tabling proved
somewhat unsuccessful.

“Tabling is not as effective as we’d
like on Pitt’s campus. People put on

The color green ﬁlled Nordy’s Place last night
when students at the Student Government Board

 meetingshowed support of Board member Phil

LaRue’s proposal to create a Green Fund.
A group of 1,618 Pitt students —-— 10 per-

cent of the student body — signed the petition *

for the resolution as of March 18, LaRue said.

LaRue said.

The Green Fund mission statement states
that the project intends to promote “sustainable
growth,.practices and education at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh with the expressed intent of
improving the quality oflife for all undergradu-
ate students at the University.” ‘ T

“With the establishment of a pilot program
for the University of Pittsburgh Green Fund,
we usher in a new era of sustainability for our
campus,” LaRue said to applause from the au-

dience.
LaRue said the project will make Pitt an ex-
ample for other schools across the country for

environmental sustainability through student— .

driven projects.

Optional projects, LaRue said, might include
energy efficiency improvements in existing
buildings as well as installation of energy man-
agement systems and energy—efficient surge
protectors in residence halls.

“The_ operations of this fundwillbe 100 per-

cent transparent and accountable to the student

body. It’s your money, and therefore, it deserves v

your input,” LaRue said.

LaRue called the initiative a “bold step.” He
hopes to demonstrate the viability of the sys-
tem and show the process is concrete and will
work well;

The ﬁrst goal of the initiative will be deter-
mined by the soon—to—be—formed Student Sus-

The selection for members of Student Sus-

r by a separate committee which has not been
‘formed yet, LaRue said, and the members of that
committee have not been determined.

LaRue said his aimfor the selection commit-

mentally aware leaders on campus and student
leaders on campus who have programming ex-
perience and qualiﬁed leadership experience.”

Pitt currently has a C rating on the College

versities on campus sustainability efforts. The
report gave Pitt a C for student involvement,
LaRue said. —

However, LaRue said he received contact

volunteers wanting to help with the campaign.

’ “All the students we have spokento have just

been so positive on it. They really want to see it
happen,” said LaRue. . ‘

Board President Charlie Shull said the reso-

lution will be postponed until the next meet-

V proposal.

The pending document will be available
on the SGB website, and Shull encouraged
students to speak with Board members about
any questions they might have regarding the
resolution. ‘ —

Oakland crimes

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Police responded to a robbery and a sep-
arate home invasion in Oakland yester-
day. ,
City police said they are looking for
two men suspected of a home invasion
that occurred around 12:30 p.m. yester-

day near Wellsford and Zulema streets.
The suspects are a black man who is about
6-foot—1, 220 pounds and wore a baseball
cap with a black ski mask and a white man
who looked about 25 years old, 5—foot—1O
and 165 pounds. The white man wore a_
green, two-toned hoodie.

Six people we're at home at the time of
the home invasion, and none appeared
to be hurt.

City police said that Pitt.police were
handling the robbery, which occurred
around 4 or 5 p.m. Pitt police declined to
comment, referring all questions to their
public information officer who would not
be available until this morning.

City police said they did not think the
two incidents were connected. They said '
they did not know whether the victims
were Pitt students.

The publicity worked, and at the ﬁve-week
marker, Pitt was ranked ﬁrst in the Big East in
the Gorilla Prize and the paper and cardboard
Targeted Material divisions. The Gorilla Prize
division measures the gross amount of recy-
clable material, and the paper and cardboard
divisions target the recycled amount of the spe-
ciﬁc material. The ﬁnal rankings will be posted

    

on the RecycleMania website after every school
has turned in its last week of statistics.

Despite Pitt’s rankings, Rane said that re-
gardless of how much publicity RecycleMania
receives, it’s impossible to reach out to every
student. The lack of a central mode of com-
munication prevents everyone from knowing
about RecycleMania, she said.

the Planet, went through a trash can after a

Cooley said that ﬁnding something that
resonated with students is important in en-
couraging them to recycle. He said that form-
ing RecycleMania into a competition was away
to communicate the importance of recycling
in a way that would encourage student par-
ticipation.

“Some people respond when you talk about
saving the earth,” Cooley said. “For others,
that’s not relevant.”

professor just ignores it, but oth-
er times he cares a little more.

A This kind of cheating has been
assessed in technical classes,
which require lists of mathemati-
cal problems to be done online.
Dr. David Pritchard, a physics
professor at the Massachusetts

Institute of Technology, set up a .

detection system on his assigned
homework to look for abnormal
behavior patterns, according to
The Chronicle of Higher Educa-
tion.

The system looked for an-'

swers submitted within a min-
ute of viewing the question and
marked them as cheating for
statistics’ sake. In Pritchard’s
view, it is impossible to read the
problem and type in the answer,
let alone work it out, within a
minute. With this standard, Dr.
Pritchard found that 50 percent
more students cheated than they
let be revealed in anonymous sur-
veys, over a period of two years.

Class procedure
prompts cheating

Along with copying homework,
these labeled cheaters also per-
formed two letter grades lower
on tests than their classmates.

This is no surprise. Students‘

who didn’t put in the effort did
poorly, and that is their own
choice. -

But what is more expected
than corollary exam performance
is the original sin — cheating
on homework. It is no secret
on a school campus that online

resources which can help with
assignments are abundant in‘

quantity and quality. For exam-
ple, websites like Cramster.com

quite literally provide worked «

out solutions to problems for a
great number of popular college
textbooks. Quick information
exchanges via texting and so-
cial networking websites make
a troubling physics problem a
simple stroke of the keys. _

Part of a college education is
learning how to be resourceful,
and students are doing just that.
Searching the web is as equal a
response as opening the textbook
for assistance on homework. It
would be naive to expect students
to simply ignore the wealth to be
had. This is how the Internet is
used, and it has become a sub-
stantial part of life. .

What is more important is to
understand why students copy
homework.

Sometimes it is a time issue.
There are deadlines for home-
work assignments, and it is not
rare for someone to have forgot-
ten them, so they look for a quick
fix. Other times, students just
see the homework as busy work.
They see it as a simple churning
of numbers.

But. the greatest reason is
probably classroom structure.
One professor lectures three
hundred students on the theory
of electromagnetism while they
shufﬂe about, quietly participat-
ing in a unilateral conversation.
Some will resort to their phones,
as the lecture is not inviting, but

Columnist

The legislative battle over health care
reform is over. Through procedural
tricks, the Obama administration
succeeded in passing historically in-
trusive legislation.

Recognizing that Congress failed

Appropriately, 13 states ﬁled. suit
against the federal government last
Tuesday assertingthat, “the Constitu-
tion nowhere authorizes the,United
States to mandate, eitherdirectly or
under threat of penalty, that all citi-
zens and legal residents have qualify-

Over the past week, other states
continued to join the fray, either by

candidate in the Republican guberna-
torial primary, Corbett said he is pur-
suing the suit as “a 10th Amendment
issue” and that he would be doing so
whether he were runningfor governor
or not. ,

Predictably, Corbett’s critics on
the left —— ‘many of whom are pos-
sible opponents in the gubernatorial
election — refused to accept this ex-
planation. Notably, Allegheny County

Mindthat clause 

Lawsuits against Oba/macare highlight its inherent unconstitutionality.

Gov. Ed Rendell joined the leftist ridi-
cule of Corbett when he said that the

suit would fail “because any lawyer _

worth their saltwill tell the governors
that there’s something called the fed-
eral Supremacy Clause.”
Regrettably, Rendell’s‘education
appears to have faﬂed him because,
as any worthy former district attorney

a suit alleging that the 10th Amend— '

ment from mandating that citizens a ‘

Whatever Rendell thinks, Corbett I
i has a point. The 10th Amendment

reads as follows: “The powers not
delegated to the United States by. the
Constitution, not prohibited by it to
the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.”

Since nowhere in the Constitution
did the Founders give the United States

or — more likely — the people.

Lawsuits forward fidelity to Founders

Howard 4 6

In this way, Corbett and his co-
plaintiffs clearly have the Constitution
on theirfside. It is, after all, a document
dedicated to limited government and
created by the Founders with the goal
ofprotectingthe people and the states
from burdensome intrusions into
their respective spheres. ‘

p The reason that so many legal
scholars pronounced that the suit
has little chance is that precedent
demonstrates that the courts are un-

. willingto use the Constitution — and
especiallythe1othAmendment—to '

limit federal powers. I
Instead, over the last 100 years,
courts interpreted the Commerce
Clause as a sort of blank check for
federal power that justiﬁes every-
thing from wheat quotas to the War

. on Drugs. .
Importantly, the Roberts Court is

positionedto tumthe page onthis era

federal powerthrough a more faithful
reading of both the Constitution and
the intent of the Founders.

Texas Attorney General Greg Ab-

bottbest represented such hopeswhen

enrich the lives of some citizens.
Thereis aslim chance thatthe Rob-
erts Court will heed such arguments,
and itis sadlythe best chance we have

“It is sadly the bestchance
we have of breathing new life
intoour Constitution.”  

he said, “No public policy goal — no
matter how important or well inten-
tioned — can be allowed to trample
the protections and rights guaranteed

4 by our Constitution.” No matter the
arguments in favor of health care re- p .

form, no matter how many millions of
Americans such legislation is poised

ofbreathing new life into our Consti-

tution. Corbett should be lauded for
attempting to restore the balance of
powerbetween the people, the states

and the federalgovemment.

CONCERT PREVIEW

 

 

‘Serpents’ to dance into Pittsburgh

‘ Sierra Starks
’ Senior Staff Writer

Le Serpent Rouge is French for “the
red snake.” But tonight, it will mean
a hybrid of music and movement
for the city of Pittsburgh.

The Le Serpent Rouge Tour
brings together three acts not
commonly seen together on one
stage.

The tour features The Crow
Quill Night.Owls, who make music
with instruments such as banjos
and harmonicas to odds and ends
like washboards and spokes of a
bicycle.

Adding to the lineup are The
Gallus Brothers, Devin Champlin
and Lucas Hicks, who are known

FASHION COLUMN

for adding humor to their variety
of music.

Last but not least are the ladies
of The Indigo: Rachel Brice, Mardi
Love and Zoe Jakes. These three
are known for their innovative
style of belly dancing and 1920s
burlesque.

According to Brice, founder
of The Indigo, an" arrangement as
diverse as this can only mean one
thing — a good time. _

“It’s not really a sit down, be
quiet and hold your hat kind of
show,” Brice said, explaining that
a Le Serpent Rouge show is more
involved. From experience in past
tours, she warned that “people go
kind of nuts.”

Fellow belly dancer Love, who

i has been with The Indigo for ﬁve ,

years, calls Le Serpent Rouge ava-
riety show.

Yes, The Indigo has a belly
dance background, but “we went
for more of a variety show feel in
collaboration with these musicians
so that we can appeal to a larger
audience,” Love said.

“In total there are seven per-
formers,” Brice_said. “And we all
wear different hats during the
show.”

Scandal raises

Samantha Stahl
‘ Columnist

‘ I guess the fashion world thought

it wasn’t fair for ESPN to hog all the
sex—scandal media. Good news, Tiger
Woods — you have someone here to
steal your spotlight.

Famed fashion photographerTerry
Richardson was recently accused of
sexual misconduct. After he published
a photo of Danish model Rie Rasmus-
sen inhisbook“TerryWorld”without
herpemiission, she told Page Six that

Richardson “takes girls who are young,
manipulates themto take their clothes
off andtakes pictures ofthemtheywill
be ashamed of. They are too aﬁaid to
say no because their agency booked
them on the job and are too young to
stand up for themselves.” Richardson
has since denied the allegations.

Since then, an article in the Huff-
ington Post reported that anumber of
other models have come forward to
complain about Richardson’s alleged
creepy behavior:

allegations are ‘ urtﬁil” and “false”

The important issue here isn’t
whetherthe allegations are true or not
— it’s what the scandal has brought
into the public eye as faras the model-
ing industry goes.

Now, Richardsoniswell knownfor
his sexually provocative work. This is a
guy who doesn’t shy away from nudity
or explicit images. Ifyou’re notfamiliar
with his work, know that his photo
style is probably the inspiration for

American Apparel’s ads. That should '

give you a visual.

Here’s the thing -— Richardson is
abig deal. He’s shot ad campaigns for
everyone from Gucci‘ to Miu Miu and
features for every fashion publication

that matters. Celebrities and models’

Two weeks ago, every major fash-

“Sometimes we play music, sometimes we
do burlesque with props, sometimes we belly

“Our aesthetic has sort of a 19205, 19305

ed that since the trio’s acts tend to borrow a
lot from the early twentieth century, it was

only right to incorporate The Gallus Brothers 1

we wanted to share that by exposing [audi-

said, adding that most of the belly dancing
shows she has been exposed to have been
strictly centered on belly dancing and its
surrounding culture. , I

have live musicians or tend to strictly play
music suited for belly dancing,” Love said.
“This show is a collaboration with musi-
cians who aren’t after that,” she said. “We

V ﬁnd [The Gallus Brothers and The Crow‘Quill

Night Owl] to be very talented‘ performers
who we’re excited to work with,” she said.

For Brice, belly dancing is ﬁrst and fore-
most, but she loves that Le Serpent Rouge of-
fers a wide spectrum and a variety of different
acts. “As a performer, I love doing belly dance,
but I also love watching the crazy antics that
go on and listening to the music,” she said.

Though in the past she’s seen shows that
range from strictly belly dancing to those of
Vaudevillian style, she said Le Serpent Rouge
is a show like no other. “I’ve never actually
seen a show. quite like this one because it
involves so many different elements,” she
said.

Love calls the show a “well—rounded bucket
of entertainment.” She added that she thinks
the tour has been received well thus far.

“In most of the reviews I’ve seen people
are excited thatit wasn’t just two hours of
straight belly dance,” she said. “In general,
I think people ﬁnd the bands quite delight-
ful as well.’’ i . '

Love encourages the Pittsburgh area to
come to the show to “see something a little
different than they typically see.” She says she
can “almost guarantee” that statement. What

she can deﬁnitely guarantee is that this tour ' l

raises the bar for traveling shows.
“The music is great, the performers are

incredibly entertaining and the dancers are e i

very good at what theydo,” she said. r .

sarcastic Dr. O’Hara (Eve Best) — interacted in
such realistic ways, and the tired concept of the
medical drama took on a humanity (and a sense
of realism)’that made “Grey’s Anatomy’ ’ look like
a telenovela. A A

In this new season, however; while the writing
is still sharp and the performances still on point,
the show is starting to exhibit the faintest hints
of faltering. An odd addition to the cast (more
so a replacement, because of the departure of
Haaz Sleirnan) has a rehabilitated nurse from
the first season back with the‘ sole intention of

being a plot tool to explore Jackie’s addiction in
upcoming episodes. s

Wever and O’Hara aren’t given muchto do, and
pharmacist Eddie (Paul Schulze) wanders in and

' out ofscenes,tota1lyunaware thathisstorylineis

no longer compelling for viewers.

At this point, however; the good heavily out-
weighs the bad. Peter Facinelli’s Dr. Cooper— or
Coop, as he prefersto be called —— is developing
naturally, though he is stillsomewhat of a doofus.
In the second episode, he defends his tweeting
of hospital goings-on by saying, “People follow

my life online. I’m sharing my thoughts with the
world,” and then, “It’s not blogging —-— it’s Twit-
ter.”

And Twitter users everywhere shoutahearty,
“Thank you!”

Ihave faith thatthe showcancatch itselfbefore
it slips past the point of no return.

The Eddie storyline needs to be resolved, stat, ‘

and let’s bring the supporting characters back
into the foreground, because although Falco is
incredible, “Nursejackie” isbestwhen itperforms
as a team.

But sometimes saying no is easier in theory

These models shouldn’t be put (or put tl1em-

WRESTLING



Panther wrestler an All-American

Atﬁrst, Tyler Nauman disliked the sport, but now he has ‘hopes for ct national championship.

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

When Tyler Nauman started 4
wrestling in ﬁrst grade he
didn’t really like it.

“I had a coach that would just
show moves, it was real hard to
learn anything just watching him.
I was hoping for something more

hands on,” Nauman said. “It was '

tough, and I didn’t like it.”

He stuck with it, though,
and his persistence paid off two
weeks ago, when he became an
All-American by ﬁnishing ﬁfth at
the NCAA Championships

. Nauman said that the support
of his family has powered his suc-
cess more than anything else.

V “My dad was a single parent

and took me to tournaments
every weekend since I was five
or six, and my stepmom is just
amazing, whether it be ‘sending
me texts or e—mails to get me
through tough times or just to
say hello.” ,

“It really helps but also makes
it hard because I wantto perform
at my best always to not let them
or myselfdown. It’s deﬁnitely
a huge part of my success,” he
said.

Coach Rande Stottlemyer
agreed that .Nauman’s family has
played an important role in his
development.

“Tyler really ha_s a great sup-

port system behind him, with a . ‘

family that travels all over the
place to see him wrestle,” Sto-

Nauman > 19

After makinghistorylastyearbywin-
ningaﬁrst-round matchinthe BigEast

Championship, the Pitt women’s ten— _

nis team looks to repeat history.

With a 2-1 weekend record, includ-
ing wins over Seton Hall and winless
Villanova, head coach George Dief-
fenbach is conﬁdent the Panthers (7-4,
3-3 BigEast) can qualify forthe regular
season ﬁnale tournament.

“They take the top 12 teams in a
16-team league, and the [Seton Hall]
win really enhanced our chances of
qualifying for it,” Dieffenbach said.

Dieffenbach said the Panthers
would most likely have to win the rest
of their conference matches to ﬁnish
inninth place inthe BigEast, the same
seed they earned last season.

But by earningalow seed, the_Pan-
thers would still need to face the elite
ofthe conference inearly rounds, such
as Rutgers.

Pitt won matches against Seton.
Hall (4-0) and Villanova (4-2) but lost

Senior Staﬁ Writer -

7-0 to Rutgers on Sunday. It’s been a
theme for Pitt, which has never beat
Rutgers, losing all 15 matches to the
Scarlet Knights. , .

“Rutgers is always very strong.
They have a lot of talent, and we
played a lot of close matches against
them,” Dieffenbach said. “It was a
7-0 loss but a fairly close 7-0 loss. Our
number-one doubles played very well
and [freshman Karma] Parbhulostin
three sets.”

Pitt bounced back on Sunday to
beat Seton Hall in a match that, due
to time constraints, was played in Big
East Conference tournament format.
The winner of the match is the first
team to earn the fourth point.

Junior Adela Aprodu and fresh-
man Gabrielle Catanzariti clinched
the match for Pitt with singles victo-
ries over the No. 2 and No. 4 singles
opponents respectively.

The Panthers move onto face Car-
negie Mellon next Tuesday. Dieffen—
bach said the match will be a difﬁcult
one considering the extended break
and the Tartans’ strong team.

“CMU will be a good match for

ent in sight for Pitt

us; they’re ranked in the top 10 in the
countzy in Division III,” Dieffenbach
said.

The week off will help the team
recuperate after a season of wear and
“The tennis season is a very long’
year. Unlike most of the other Big East
sports, itstarts inearly September, and
it goes the whole way through until
April,” Dieffenbach said. “That’s along
time to keep your team focused and
injury-free and rested.” we

The hardworkis done. He said the
team is getting a couple days off over
Easter to make sure they “stay out of
the training room.”

The hiatus could prove valuable if
the Panthers hittheir stride and 
for the Big East Championship. ‘ ”

“I would saywe’re going to need at
least four more BigEastwinsto qualify
forthe conference toumament,”Dief—
fenbach said.

It’s abigtaskathand, he added, but
the experience from last year’s seveﬁﬂ.

Don’t be surprised if you see the Seattle
Mariners’ Milton Bradley playing outﬁeld
on a sunny day this season wearing glasses
that look more like Venetian blinds than
your typical pair of shades.

According to Bradley, who’s about to

play for his eighth team in 11 years, he’s

baseball’s version of everyone’s favorite — ,

or least favorite — rapper who popularized
a very ridiculous—looking pair of glasses.
“If I was a musician, I’d be Kanye West. If
I was in the NBA, I’d be Ron Artest,” Bradley
told the Associated Press last week. “In
“baseball, they’ve got Milton Bradley. I’m

the bad guy.”’

First off, kudos to Bradley for knowing
exactly how to play this role: There is no
easier wayto ﬁgure out who the bad guy is
than to, listen for someone talking about
themselves in third person. Unless it’s The
Rock, who was a bad guy on occasion but
is still kind of awesome thanks to that eye-
brow thing he did.

There are plenty of reasons some might
think Bradley is baseball’s bad guy. For
starters, he was ejected from two spring
training games last week. While that’s quite
impressive to some — spring training re—_
ally doesn’t count for anything, and it’s
ridiculous to argue over calls in an exhibi-
tion game — others se_e that as being overly
aggressive. ,

In an interview with The New York
Times earlier in the spring, Bradley blamed

Nauman 4 15

ttlemyer said. L
That support pushed Nauman to very

impressive distances at Middletown High ‘

School, in Harrisburg, compiling a career
win total of 156, with 75 pins (both school

‘records). Nauman’s impressive numbers

propelled him to become a four-time
Pennsylvania state place-winner, includ-

ed , ing a state championship his senior year
~ in the 130—pound weight class. _
With the impressive wrestling resume

that Nauman compiled during high school,
he was actively recruited by many col-
leges. But Nauman knew all along that
Pitt was the place for him. And it was the
only school where he took an ofﬁcial ath-
letic visit. . ’

Nauman said that he had a minor in-
terest in both Penn State and North Caro-
lina.

“But when PI got here, I just liked the‘

whole city and liked the team when I got

the two days to-hang-out with them,” he

said.

But there was already someone in his
weight class when he arrived on cam-
pus. ‘

“Most people wouldn’t like that the
team had a ﬁfth—year senior in Drew Head-
lee that was in the spot that'I wanted to
wrestle,’’ he said. “I really saw it as an op-_
portunity  Igot to work with him every
day and get myself that much better.”

Nauman entered Pitt as a redslhirt, tak-
ing the first season to practice with the
team and compete at open tournaments.

At those tournaments he garnered an
impressive 21-8 record, and after that ﬁrst
year, he still had four years of eligibility

' remaining.

“Doing five years, it’s not for every-
body. It really is a year—round'commit-
ment. If you don’t [commit], you just won’t
be competitive,” Stottlemyer said. '

“Tyler is one of [those]. guys that can '
be productive throughout five years of V

wrestling, he’s a kid that does wrestling

' all the time. During the summer he does

camps,” he said.

As Stottlemyer put it, there’s simply
something in the mindset of Nauman that
drives him to succeed on the mat.

“He is arguably our best guy. You want
him out there on the mat,” Stottlemyer,
said. “When the lights go on something
goes off inside that brings out the best in.
[guys like Nauman]-.” —

During his second year at Pitt, as a red-
shirt freshman, Naumanfound himself
in the starting lineup at 141 pounds. He
achieved a 29-9 record on the season,
including an individual Eastern Wrestling
League title and earning a bid to the NCAA
Championships. A -

Nauman went 1-2 at the Champion-
ships, but it was in hisﬁrst loss. of the
tournament where Nauman built a lot of
confidence.

In this match Nauman lost 6-4 in sud-
den victory — during an overtime period
—, to the eventual champion,J.Jaggers of
Ohio State. '

c “That guy goes on to win the national
championship,” Stottlemyer said. “But
you know, if you ask [Jaggers] who his
toughest match was, he’ll tell you Tyler
Nauman.” ' . ‘ ' . '

Nauman described his mentality before
matches as always conﬁdent;

“Some people get really nervous before



big matches. I don’t,” Nauman said. “I’ve '

been nervous, but never really nervous.
That match [againstjaggers] was the ﬁrst
time I had ever felt any of that.”

c This year,- Nauman improved-to a 36-5
record, including a perfect 1830' record
during-team dual meets. This led Nauman
to be named a team captain in only his
second year as a starter.

This leadership contributed to Pitt’s .

run to its first ever EWL team champion-
ship.

  Team captain led Pitt to its first EWL title‘

‘at

“Every year the goal was an EWL title,”‘
Nauman said. “But this year we made
small goals, which we knew in the long
run would bring in that title. As a team
we dedicated [ourselves] to improving
our work ethic to win.”

Stottlemyer said Nauman’s experiences’-
as an All—American can only give him more
determination to succeed.

“Now he has two chances for the na-
tional title,” Stottlemyer said. “Obviously,
that’s his goal.”

March '31, 2010 I The Pitt News I’ WWw.pittnews.com

Bradley should interrupt Taylor Swift to be like Kanye

Littman 4 16 °

” with the Cubs, on the city of Chicago. The

Cubs also suspended Bradley for the last
few weeks of the season last year after he
was scratched from the starting lineup with

’ a sore knee. After this, he said to a news-

er-

I -g.-.

1%

paper, “You understand why they haven’t
won in 100 years here.” The last time the
Cubs won the World Series was 1908.
There were other incidents too, like the
time in 2008 when Bradley tried to chase
down a Kansas City Royals announcer after
a game because the announcer said some

unﬂattering things about Bradley, accord-
ing to ESPN. Or the time in the season be-
fore that when Bradley was so adamant that
an umpire made a wrong call that he had to
be held back by his manager, then tripped
and tore his ACL, ending his season. And

. then there has been broken bats, battered

water coolers and other little slip—ups.
While all of that is great, Bradley isn’t
approaching Artest’s level. Artest is,unpar—
alleled. Fans don’t like Artest because one
time he ran into the stands and punched

a guy. Like, during a game, ran into the
stands and fought people. It was amaz-
ing. The chances of that happening again
are slim, if existent at all, but you really
only have to ﬁght a fan once to make your
point. So in my estimation, Artest is a bit
of a stretch._ '

But does that really make Bradley base-
>ball’s Kanye West? Let’s not crown him yet,
but he’s certainly in the lead. According to
my standings, Hideki Matsui is currently in
second, followed by David Eckstein.

So if Bradley really wants to earn his
self—declared comparison, he’s got some

A‘ work to do. Luckily, The Pitt News is here

to show him the way. . *

First, West got his break as a producer.
Bradley’s already well known, so this can’t
be how he gets his break, but if he wanted
to sit out part of the season to coach, tha

‘ would be step one. ‘

Next, West ﬁrst caught attention as a
rapper after getting in a car accident and
recording a song with his jaw wired shut.

Since Bradley being unable to talk might ‘

actually beneﬁt him in the public eye but
wouldn’t be impressive on the baseball
ﬁeld, he should play a few games with one
of his arms in a sling.

During an interview, Bradley should say

i that Major League Baseball commissioner

Bud Selig doesn’t care about right ﬁelders.
It wouldn’t be the ﬁrst time he made such
a remark. 7

Bradley, then with the Dodgers, criti-
cized teammate Jeff Kent of- being a bad

if team leader because Kent “doesn’t know

how to deal with African-American peo-
ple,” as he told the Associated Press. Of

course, Bradley’s comments were made a _

couple of months before West’s, so perhaps
West is the Bradley of music.

While»Taylor Swift is accepting the Na-
tional League MVP award,.Bradley has to
barge on stage, steal a microphone and say,
“Albert Pujols had one of the best seasons
of all time.” Then he has to humorously
shrug.

Maybe Bradley can get really upset after
losing a few games and only do interviews
in Auto—Tune, as well.

If Bradley wants to say “fam” a lot dur-
ing conversations and see if he can get
Louis Vuitton Mariners uniforms, that
could only help.

. .So there you have it, Milton Bradley,

i your “Become Kanye West Starter Kit.”

Perhaps just one more piece of advice
for Bradley, this one courtesy of his kindred
spirit, Mr. West: _

“You need to pump your brakes and
drive slow, homie.”
