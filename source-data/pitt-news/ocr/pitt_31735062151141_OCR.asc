Pitt-in-China
Campaign On

 

Coeds Soliciting Funds
For Chinese School

A concentrated drive for funds
to send to the support of Lingnan
University, leading Chinese school
supported by American institutions,
is being waged on the campus to-
day.

More than 30 coeds, members of
Owens and ‘Mortar Board, honorary
fraternities, are stationed at prom-
iment points on campus this morn-
ing ready to approach student and
faculty members for contributions.

According to the “Pitt-in-China”
Continuation Committee members,
who are directing the one-day
drive here, the University has a
special interest in the Chinese
school because of Charles Seidle,
a. prominent graduate of last year,
who has been on the Lingnan facul-
ty since September.

In letters received recently from
Seidle he stressed the inadequate
equipment of the chemistry de-
partment at Lingnan, and suggested
that any funds obtained in the
campus drive should be used in
purchase of text books for this
course.

Pitt has contributed to the sup-
port of Lingnan for the past eight
years, and in the drive last spring
more than $200 was obtained from

May Appoint
Future Dean
Before Fall

Will Import Eastern Man
To Fi1l.Post Vacated
-By Clothier

 

 

‘ Pitt will have a new dean of

men by the opening of the fall .

term. This information was re-
viiiled to the Pitt Weekly yester-
,-day. by John ~Weber, University
business manager.

Negotiations which are expected
to reach a climax during the next
few days are now under way with
several prominent educational ad-
ministrators in Eastern schools.
Mr. Weber declined to reveal the
identity of the men under consid-
eration pending the outcome of
the present ‘negotiations.

In the event that a successor to
Dr. Robert C.%-Clothier, former dean
who resigned March 1 to become
president of Rutger's University,
is selected within the next two
weeks, ‘it is not likely, according
to Mr. Weber, that he will assume
his duties here until September 1.

Walter J. Rome, who has been
conducting the work of Dean Cloth-
ier since the latter’s resignation,
will return next fall to his former
duties as Graduate Manager of

tudent Activities.

_ Clothier will ‘be. formally in-
sta led as president of Rutgers on
June 11, following the annual con-
-vocation exercises of the school.
Chancellor John G. Bowman will
officially represent the University
at the inauguration ceremony. Sev-
eral other members of the Pitt ad-
ministration are expected to ac-
company Dr. Bowmzaan.

May Shorten
Rush Season

 

Temporary Change Sought
For Fraternity Relief

At a special meeeting of interfra-
ternity Council, held last evening
in the Delta Tau Delta house, a
recommendation was placed before
council members to amend the fra-
ternity rushing period at the Uni-
versity next year.

The recommendation was the re-
sult of a meeting of the fraternity
advisery association, composed of
faculty advisers. and alumni, held
in the ‘Omega Delta house last Fri-
day to discuss the matter of
strengthening weaker fraternities
on the campus.

Several fraternities, by gradua-
tion, will lose the greater extent
of their membership. In order that
these houses may carry on next
year, new members must be install-
ed as soon as possible in the re-
spective houses.

The fraternity advisery commit-
tee will meet this afternoon to dis-
cuss the results of Council's recom.
mendation, and will approve or
amend the changes proposed. ,

In creating a shorter deferred
rushing season next fall it was ar-
gued by those in favor of the tem-
porary change that the smaller
fraternities would have an almost
equal chance in competing against
the larger fraternities for enlisting
new men.

Results of the proposal will be
announced within the next two

weeks.

N Seventh . Queen

Her Majesty Louise Linn will
receive her crown next Tuesday as
regally and graciously as ever did
the Anglo-Saxon Queen Victoria,
from whose ancient coronation cer-
emony Miss Amos has adapted
our Pitt Senior Queen Coronation.

Heralds and herb-strewers will
clear the way for the queen as she
marches in the royal procession
from State Hall to Heinz House,
where robed in the regal purple,
she will be the seventh such to be
added to the royal lineage of Pitt.

Four years of excellent work in
curricular and extra-curricular ac-
tivities have merited for Louise
Linn this highest honor that can
come to any senior woman.

Her outstanding activity during

_, ﬂ   seltﬁéd as President and

   

the four years has ‘ been debating. ,

manager of the team, participated

in the highest number of debates
of any coed, and received member-
ship in Delta Sigma Rho, an hon-
orary debating fraternity of high
requirements.

This year she has acted as Chief
Justice of the Senior Court, one of
the highest positions on campus.
She was recently awarded a book
of poetry by Panhellenic for hav-
ing the highest scholastic record
of any senior fraternity woman.
The social side of her college edu-
cation has not been neglected, for
she proved herself a capable com-
mittee member of Soph Hop.. In
addition to all these things she
has worked part time all during
her four years as a cashier, govern-
ess and salesgirl.

In recognition of these well bal-
anced achievements she will have
the Anglo-Saxon crown of dull gold
placed upon her brow by Chri tine

Adopt Many Innovations

“A deﬁnitely matured perspec-
tive toward fraternity problems
has been the prime factor in mak-
ing Panhellenic Association suc-
cessful this year," according to
Miss Helen P. Rush, extra-curricu-
lar advisor and assistant to the
dean of women. “Routine details
such as rushing rules and technical
business have been so effciently
cared for,” says Miss Rush, “that
Panhellenic has had more time
than ever before to devote to inter-
fraternity cooperation.”

Perhaps the most striking inno-
vation in this year’s Panhellenic
program has been the decree that
for the common good of all wo-
men's fraternities must by 1935
have approximately equal member-
ship not exceeding twenty-four.
The close cooperation of Panh~el-
lenic with President’s Council, be-
ginning with a joint conference at
the Shannopin Country‘, Club last
fall, contributed much to make
such ruling possible.

Other plans inaugurated for the

eciﬁc purpose of lessening the
burden on the small fraternity,
which requires all of its resources
increase its
‘membership to the desired number,
include the placing of Panhellenic
dues on a numerical scale with a
minimum rate of twenty dollars a
fraternity instead of the former
thirty dollars, and a per capita
tax of two dollars extra per mem-
ber of a fraternity numbering
more than ﬁfteen-

The banning of. men from we-
men’s fraternity rushing, which
proved effective both economically
and socially, the substitution of a
Bid Day for fall rushing, the inclu-
sion of Panhellenic and fraternity
information in the mentor train-
ing for freshmen women were
among the highlights of the inno-
vations in Panhellenic’s program.

Chemistry Club?-Names
Officers for Next Year‘

At the chemistry faculty lunch-
eon given for the members of the
-Chemistry Club and the special
students in chemistry last Friday

ert Ferguson, Col. ’33, president;

of the game and made it my main interest at Pitt even though
ma and pa thought that I came to get an education.

The natural result of such a condition is a tendency on the part of

Netmen Win
Seven, Lose

One Match

Conclude Season With
. Grove City On
' Saturday

The powerful Pitt varsity racquet
array of Dr. Billy McElroy has en-
joyed a very successful season to

date. They rank by their con-
quests as one of the greatest ten-
nis aggregations in. the.country.
.The team ends the season with a
record of seven victories ‘against
one setback.

The seven victories
Panthers boast of are
quesne, 9-0; Bethany, 9-0;
City, 6-1; Duquesne again,
Carnegie Tech, 8-1;
6-3, and Maryland, 7-2.

Navy Wins

The only reverse
suffered came at the hands of the
Midmenship of Navy. The service-
men handled the boys roughly and
came out on the long end of a 5%-
31;§ count.

In the eight matches the Pan-
thers played, they annexed a total
of 57% pointy while their oppo-
nents registered 121,5 points. In
percentages, that means that the
racqueteers won 78.1 per cent of
the sets they played. That is pret-
ty fair tennis playing in any man's
section of this country.

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
four other matches scheduled with
local teams were rained out and
remain as unﬁnished business. One
of these matcheswas scheduled
with Bethany, two of them with
the Presidents from Washington
and Jefferson, and one with the
Plaid of Carnegie Tech. These
four matches, had they been play-
ed would have resulted in about 35
additional points for Pitt.

Ganger Undefeated

Of the six regular varsity play-
ers Nate Ganger, the Forest City
Public Courts Champ, was the only
man to win all his singles match-
es. Jacobs and Wald each lost one
while Captain Ed. Alcorn, O’Lough.
lin and Goodman each dropped
two.

On the other hand the only dou-
bles pair to go undefeated was the
team of Goodman and Wald. They
were in a tie with Navy represen-
tatives when darkness halted one
of the frays. Jacobs and Ganger
lost once; Jacobs and Alcorn drop-
ped one; and O’Loughlin and Al-
corn lost two times.

Prospects Bright

Next year the prospects for the
Panthers tennis_ team will be un-
usually bright. Billy Jacobs, Billy
O’Loughlin, and Nate Ganger are
all sophomores and have two more
years of varsity competition before
them. Also, Vollmer, a member of
last. year’s team who was ineligible
this year, will be back on deck
and eligible. The other two “var-
sity berths will probably be ﬁlled
by two members of this season's
high class freshman aggregation.

Captain Ed. Alcorn, Irving Good-
man, and ’Harry Wald, numbers 4,
5 and 6 respectively on this year’s
team will play their last matches
for the Blue and Gold on Saturday

Alpha Phi Delta
Meets .Winner In
Tournament Final

 

Delta Tau Delta and Sigma ‘Alpha Mu, two men ’s national
social fraternities, will clash tonight at 6 o’clock at Trees gym
ﬁeld in the semi—ﬁna1s of the second annual interfraternity mush-

ball tournament.

The game originally scheduled for Monday night was post-
ponedand repostponed until the two teams ﬁnally agreed to

meet tonight.

The winner of this game will clash with Alpha

Phi Delta. in the title battle latei¢

in the week.
Grand Old Finish.

Incidentally, the Alpha Phi Delts
passed through the semi-ﬁnal stage
by virtue of an old fashioned’ com-
bination of 9. Garrison, Merriwell,
and Rover Boy ﬁnish to nose out
the ﬁghting furies from the Phi
Kappa lodge,.7-6.

A run in the ninth inning proved
the margin of victory for the Daw-
son street boys, Johnny Adonizio,
shortstop and a. former player in
the New York-Pennsylvania league,
and Gambatese, left-ﬁelder, featur-
ed the play of the victors.

Last year, the tournament was
sponsored by the Pitt Weekly,
which presented a silver statuette
to Theta Chi, the ultimate winner
of the tournament. Interfraternity
council is sponsoring this year’s
tournament and is awarding a sil-
ver cup to the championship team.

New Teams in Finals.

Last year’s ﬁnalist, Theta Chi
and Omega Delta, were both elim-
inated in the ﬁrst round of com-
petition and the dark horses are
ﬁghting it out for the cup and the
honor of the lodge.

All three teams remaining in the
tournament had tough times get-
ting through the second round.
Alpha Phi Delta came through in
the ﬁnal two innings after trailing
1-0 and batted its way to a 5-2
triumph over Howdy O’Dell and his
Phi Delt fraters. ,

Sigma Alpha Mu scored three
runs in the eighth to nose_out
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 12-11, in a
wild hitting battle. Baker featured
on the mound for the victors, al-
lowing but one run in four innings
after relieving Drazen.

Delta Tau Delta defeated Kappa
Sigma, one of the early favorites,
6-4, in a surprise match of the sec-
ond round. '

held last Saturday by Kappa Phi

the mushball game played in the
afternoon. The faculty members
starring for the graduate frater-
nity included those hard-hitting
left-handers, Dr. Franklin and Jim
Potts; Dr. Nietz, the fumbling
short-stop; “Heavy” Siedle, ﬁrst-
baseman extraordinary; and that
hot-corner artist, Dr. Goldberger.

The rest of th lineup altered
with the whims of the various
players, but it always sparkled. A
glngery inﬁeld kept up a snappy
line of chatter—-with the pups pre-

Hold Frosh
Swim Meet

Stage Annual Phys Ed

Intramural Contest

 

Freshmen and Phys Ed swim-
mers had their day last Friday aft-
ernoon at Trees Pool, when the
annual Freshman Physical Educa-
tion Intramural Swimming Meet
was held.

The meet was under the direc-
tion of the Trees Gym physical
educational directors, and was at-
tended by one of the largest crowds
ever to witness this event. A

The meet was run off very effi-
ciently, and quite quickly consid-

ering the size of the entry list.
The swimmers were divided into
four classes: beginners, swimmers,
intermediates, and advanced.
Those in the beginners’ class were
freshmen who could not swim at
the beginning of the year, a.nd the
class of swimmers improved in the
succeeding stages, with the ad-
vanced swimmers heading the list.
The results of the meet were
very pleasing to the various in-
structors, and in most cases
eclipsed the time set by those
swimming in last year’s meet.

The results were as follows:

Beginners’ 20-yard dash —— Won by
Storey; second, Aiken; third, Wintner.
Time-l2.3 seconds.

Swimmers’ 20-yard dash—Won by Chet!-
ner; second. Spanogians: third, Bales.

Intermediates’ 20-yard dash——-Won by
Krause; second, Elbaum; third, Gurney.
Time—ll.2 seconds.

 Pant/zegr Sport Heroes To Graduate In June

Hopes Bright
For Spikers
Next Season

Expect Great Deal From
Brilliant Freshmen;

Beat W. Va.

His track team having concluded

snappy victory over West Virginia,
Coach Frank Shea can now begin
to make plans for next year.

The Panthers compiled a. record
of three losses and two triumphs
during the past season. Ohio
State, Penn State, and Notre Dame
smeared the Pitt boys in their
ﬁrst three meets. Then, the
Panthers grasped a new lease on
life, whipped themselves back into
form, and came through with two
smashing conquests of Carnegie
Tech and, last Saturday, West Vir-
ginia.

With a number of brilliant young-
sters coming up from the fresh-
man squad to join those remaining
on the varsity team, next year’s
group should be fairly powerful.
In the sprints Milligan is the best
of the present varsity boys who
aren't leaving, Troubled by a
-perennially bad thigh, Mike never
got going this year, but a long
layoff should help him.‘ From the
freshmen, Menaker, Jacobson, and
Schlossberg are all very fast, The
ﬁrst two are the most 1ikely'look-
ing young sprinters in this district.

In the quarter and half mile runs,
Keller and Watkins remain. Kel-
ler ﬁnally regained his speed at
the end of this season and was
moving along in great style. Wat-
kins showed up well from begin-
ning to end. Kiger and McDonald
are coming from the cubs. The
former is one sweet runner and
should pair up beautifully with
Keller. .

Middle Distance Men.

Wagenhouser and Kirkpatrick, of
the frosh, will likely bear the bur-
den of the mile run next year.
Wagenhouser has been pacing the
distance consistently in about 4:40
and should shade off enough sec-
onds next year to drive him into
the ranks of constant winners.
Bill Lawrence, of the varsity, with
Albright and Hepner, of the frosh,
will handle the two mile. Law-
rence, who holds the Pittsburgh
interscholastic record, for the mile,
won the two mile run last Satur-
day and should develop ﬁnally the
possibilities which he possesses.

The weights next year will be ex.
cellent. From the varsity, Johnny
Luch, Valenti, Tormey, Carver,
Harder, and Craft will all be back.
To augment this collection of shin-
ing lights will be the freshmen
Bonavita, Gongloff, “Red” Wilkins,
Smith, and Seiffert.

Jumps, Hurdles Weak. I ‘

As in the past, the jumps and
the hurdles next year will probably
be the weakest part of the team.
Wainio, of the cubs, has shown
great promise as a high jumper
and pole vaulter, however, and may
become a full-ﬂedged star. Some
of the others may also develop into

. point getters.

The score of the Pitt-West Vir-
ginia meet was 76-59. The Moun-
taineersc took a majority of the
ﬁrst places. conning eight,‘ while
the Panthers got seven, but the
[Pitt boys were able, to snare most

of the second and third places.
The great streak of “Woody” Har-
ris in the sprints was finally
broken when Fraserbeat him out
in the 100 and 220 yard dashes.
“Woody” forced the Mountaineer
to cover the shorter distance in
the sparkling time of"9.6, however.

Bill Keller tool; th_e.440 and 880
and Lawrence beat the field in the
two mile for_,the__Panth_e_,rs, Lewis,

.thousand seniors" will receive a piece of parchment . . .
‘,3. badge of academic attainment  . and then, the bread-

lines. Of all the students who have struggled manfully with

masses of statistics, problems of grave economic import-
, ance, principles of ethics and the rights and wrongs of
government, only a few will enjoy the fruits of their aca-
demic labors by ﬁnding something to do after graduation.
, But perhaps it will be one of these young economists, soon
 to be turned loose on the world, who will ﬁnd the solution.
to our. economic ills. ’

 

For the first time in years, all the proud

f fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, and cousins who want to see

the youthful offspring receive their college degrees will

ﬁnd seats for themselves when the exercises are held in

the Stadium. Jupiter Pluvius has treated Pitt kindly for

’ lithe past 28 years by absenting himself on convocation day,

I and the old boy will hardly ﬁnd it in his heart to take ad-
7vantage of Pitt ’s exposed condition this year.

 

Students participating in activities this year
are entitled to congratulations for the success with which

V the extra-curricular program has been run off. When it -
-was. announced last Fall that the appropriation for activi-

- ties had been cut something in excess of $7,000, things
looked pretty gloomy. But because of the ﬁne spirit of
cooperation existing among students taking part in the ac-
tivities, not one of them has been abandoned.

 

Fraternities are frankly worried. Economic

 conditions were bad enough this year, but unless prosperity
makes a sudden recovery, the Greeks are going to ﬁnd it
diﬁicult to ﬁll the larder next Fall. Already one hears
rumors of doing away with the present system of deferred
rushing and making it a free-for-all. Well, it appears that

the time has almost come for drastic action.

 

Although several hundred miles distant, Pitt

students will not be unmindful of the inauguration of ‘Dr.
' Robert C. Clothier as president of Rutgers University on
‘June 11. Those who knew Dr. Clothier intimately will
not soon forget his kindness and sympathetic aid which he
was ever ready to give to the undergraduates. Mr. Weber
has announced that Dr. Cl0thier’s successor will be -chosen
during thesummer months, a development which the stu-
dent body will watch with interest.

 

Tradition is undoubtedly a powerful force,

and perhaps rightly so. Take this Senior Queen procession,
for instance. As one observer put it, “A.nd so ye herb
strewers merrily (and tritely) wended their way, bcdecking
the path of the Senior Queen with gaysome garlands of
if " 1 beautifully scented ﬂowers and n-osegays, that she and her
handmaidens might trod a path of sweet fragrance in their
‘ .colorfu,l procession.” Heigh he and heigh ho! Yet why
.;should’cynica1 males scoff? No doubt we do things equally -

Students at Stanford University

a. clean track suit to an important

Co-ed Capers

An expelled co-ed of Miami Uni-
versity sued for reinstatement on
the grounds that a state-supported
school could not put her out for
low grades. She won the case in
Common Pleas, but the decision
was reversed by the Circuit Court,
on the grounds that she was re-

v tarding other students.

The Stanford University student
paper charges that co-eds get good
grades because professors are not
proof against the wiles of Cleo-
patra, while men students must
“toil unceasingly” to pass.

A group of males, “The Society
of Female Aid,” at Vvashington
University are renting their frater-
nity pins to unadorned and un-

Several Tulane coeds have found

pennies from students and faculty
to buy some gum. -

Reviewer Praises Entire

(C

By SUNNY WESLAGER

After suffering with “He" in the
Andreyev tragedy, and smirking at-
Molnar’s satirical “The Swan," I
am almost convinced that “Hay
Fever” is Pitt Pla.yer’s 1932 “mag-
num opus." Carl Cass, in his third
production, presented a vehicle
that is pleasantly different from
any of his other stage offerings this
year.
“Hay Fever" is characteristic of
Noel Coward's pen; modern, so-
phisticated, and witty. The action
is minimized, and the situations
commonplace, but character badm-
age provides the humor. The Bliss
family, Sorel, Simon, Judith, and
David, are a temperamental lot;
the play is concerned with a week-
end party at their Cookham (Eng-
land) country home. Four guests,
each invited by one of the B1iss's,
ﬁnd themselves in an almost in-
sane environment; each ﬂnds him-
self inadvertently having an affair
with one of the hosts. Before the
ﬁnal curtain, these guests, resolved
to make an exit from their “malson
de sante,” steal away in the morn-
ing sunlight without making

‘noisily!

The play, as interpreted by the
Player's cast, was a triﬂe artiﬁcial.
It seemed that someone had said,
“~C’mon, gang, let's get modern."
And then distributed “damns” and
cigarettes to furnish lurid and
risque details. Oh, yes, the ladies
smoked, drank, and blurted naugh-
ty words.

Gestures Surprise.

Jean Stotler, as Sorel Bliss, and
Dan Sutter, as her brother, were
acceptable as ultra-modern chil-

Fraternities

 

18 Alumni Members Meet,
Discuss Problems

 

Eighteen alumni representatives
of the campus social fraternities,
organized as the University Fra-
ternity Advisory Association, met
last Friday evening and formulat-
ed plans for a, program designed
to improve the present fraternity
system.

Organized purely as an advisory
body, the group will attempt to
solve problems concerning coop,-
erative buying, resident house moth-
ers, membership increase and prop-
erty taxation. Prominent business
and professional men, in addition
to several members of the Univer-
sity faoulty, comprise the associa-
tion.

Each of the men’s social fraterni-
ties is represented by one of its
alumni members, elected by the
students to serve in an advisory
capacity in the organization-. A
An executive board was announc.
ed this week, and includes Clar-
ence L. Van Sickle, assistant pro-
fessor of accounting in the School
of Business Administration, presi-
dent; Ira R. Hill, attorney, vice
president; Dr. W. N. St. Peter,
professor of phy.sic.s in the College,
secretary; J. G. Quick, University
registrar, and Dr. Alexander Lowy,
professor of chemistry in the Col-
lege.

Pitt Player Offering of Season

 

Bowman, the artistic parents, car-
ried away the acting laurels with
bk-illful delineations. Doug’s ‘big
audience moment came when he
was interrupted by his wife in an
embrace with Myra. His manual
gestures during that embrace
would have startled Mr. Comstock
or any Y. M. C. A. secretaries in
the audience. His weak excuse:
“Are there any chocolates inqthe
house,~ dear?" went over like a
thunder shower. Miss Bowman's
impersonation of the feminine star
of “Love's Whirlwind,” and her
lines from that Thespian gem,
coaxed the most laughs from the
amiable audience.

Charles Foreman, even though
his English accent was undecided
at times, and James McCormick
show promise for future shows;
they were ﬁne as the two perplexed
male visitors.

Helen Bair and Emmy Lou Hal-
ler, portraying opposite feminine
types, one the woman of affairs,
the other a timid ﬂapper, carried
on nobly. Mary Elizabeth Robert-
son, as the impolite maid who had
been her mistress’ dressing room
attendant in the good old, days of
“Love's Whirlwind,” was as crazy
as the rest of the family. Her
change in attitude after her palm
had been lined with, shillings de-
lighted the audience."

Typical Crowd.

As is Pitt's tradition, a pitifully
small audience received the Play-
ers’ offering. This reviewer is sin-
core in his belief that a. function-
ing publlclty staff could remedy
the situation. I pray for a con-
tinuance of the calibre of this
year's shows, and bigger, better
audiences for next year.

Can you make people work? Can
you express your ideas succinctly?
Are you, ideas original? Have you
the ability to inspire others with
your enthusiasrns? This is not a
political questionnaire, but merely

part of the achievement report
which heads of all campus activi-
ties submit to W. S. G. A. at the
conclusion of their yearly program.

With the idea of selecting women
for committee work-next, year, this
week women who have participated
in activities will be evaluated on
the basis of leadership ability and
accomplishment. This survey is
being conducted for the ﬁfth time
through the Dean of Women's Of-
ﬁces 1

“We attempt to put the emphasis
on the quality rather than quanti-
ty of work done,” Miss Helen P.
‘Rush, assistant to the Dean of Wo-
men, explains. “Students are esti-
mated -by other students A with
whom they work, and,a composite
of their ability and attitude is ob-
tained.” Incidentally, this system,
used in conjunction with the point
scale system, is original with Pitt.

The reports are divided into two
parts. One section deals with the

pus with ‘respect to women stu-
dents, and suggestions for improve-
ments. . The other part evaluates

What a whale of a difference just
a few drops will make—-should they
fall two weeks from today, while
the seniors are dusting off their
caps and gowns for the Commence-
ment exercises.

For twenty-eight years, according

to Miss Mildred E. Smith, secretary
to the Chancellor, commencement
day has been a splendid example
of Russell Lowell's rare day in
June. For twenty-eight years Ju-
piter Pluvius has withheld his
showers on the occasion. Now
comes the twenty-ninth. “Will the
weatherman follow the precedent?”
graduates are asking.
C For, should the clouds decide to
unburden. themselves Commence-
ment day, each graduate’s quota of
guests, since Memorial Hall's seat-
ing capacity is 3,500,- will be 1.8 per-
sons. Realizing that the subdivi-
sion of a single parent is an ex-
tremely delicate. and difficult pro-
cess, at best, the University has
limited each senior to a single
guest ticket in the event of rain.

In initiating the custom of out-
door convocation, the University is

13 Initiated into Druids

falling in line with the practice of I ‘

numerous large colleges. At the
Unlverslties of Pennsylvania.-"and,
Harvard, the diplomas are’ present-;
ed to the graduates on the same
ﬁelds on which the football war-
riors fought for the glory of their
respective Alma Maters. At Co-
lumbia University the exercises are
held on the library steps, in the

shadow of the statue of ’ Alma» T

Mater.

At the open air exercises at the i
United States Military Academy at
West Point, the highest ranking
graduating cadet‘ was, until recent-
ly, kissed by his “best girl." Which’
gives us the idea of starting the
custom of having the University.

may be some objections.

One advantage of the unlimited
supply of seats in the stadium will
be the opportunity for a multiplic-

leaders have offered to organize
