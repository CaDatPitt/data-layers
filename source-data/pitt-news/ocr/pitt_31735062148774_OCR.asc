Faculty, Students Favor
Hospitalization Project

By Lewis Riley
As a pioneering drive against the ﬁnancial shock of student
hospital expenses swung into action on campus this morning, student

and faculty spokesmen combined to give the group insurance plan
the unqualiﬁed support of the entire University. -

Rufus H-. Fitzgerald, provost of University, led the united ex-
pression of praise when he termed the h0.spitali.zation plan “a ﬁne

thing.”_ 1 T  >-
Provost" Fitzgerald» said: '

.4.

“I: have heard a g=reat—deal<* of enthusiasm on the part of the faculty
for the" pl‘an.I~It hasjce.rtainl3t~ demonstrated‘ ‘--tor: me that the group plan of
hospitalization is a ﬁne thing. It is a. great advantage for both students

and faculty.” --

‘The campus -drive for hospital. insurance got under way this morning

when students were given an op-
portunity to express their interest
in the plan at-a-;groundkﬂoorséboot-h.
Detailed information concerning the
hospitalization plan will be avail-
able at the booth. throughout the
week.

Designed to end the “dread of
hospital bills,” the hospitalization
plan is open to all regularly-en-
rolled undergraduate students who
may share in the extensive hospital
beneﬁts provided for members. The
beneﬁts will be provided by a pure-
ly voluntary insurance plan spon-
sored jointly by the Pitt News and
the Student Health Serv:ice. Co-
operating with these organizations
is the Hospital Service Association
of Pittsburgh. 5

Many University faculty mem-
bers are already insured by the
Hospital Service association, it was

revealed this week. During the ﬁrst

year of faculty hospitalization, 64
persons used the service and "over
$3,000 in hospital" beneﬁts was made
available. Individual beneﬁts _var-

ied from $4.50 to $147.25.

Miss Thrysa W. Amos, dean of
women, was enthusiastic in her
support of the movement.

Miss Amos said: , «

“I- think it, is something that
every «student should take advan-
tage of. 1

“It should be welcomed for two
reasons: (1) it safeguards the stu-
dents, themselves, and (2) permits
us all to work together to help the

unfortunate student who becomes
suddenly’ ill.”

In voicing student opinion on the
movement, Jack Hoeveler said:

“It is the finest thing that has
hit-the campus in a. long ‘time. Any
student who doesn’t take advan-
tage of it is making a serious mis-
take. I congratulate the News
upon their sponsorship- of such a.
worthy project.”

Said Pat Cusick, past president
of Student Faculty Association:

“From what I know of the hos-
pitalization plan I am» certainly
heartily in favor of it. It is some-
thing that the students need very
greatly.”

Auleene M. Jamison, director of
the women’s student health service,
said Monday: —

“Since hospitalization has proved
of so much help to the faculty and
to the general public, it will be a
genuine benefit to students, most
of,_whom are too old toube included
in family hospitalization. My re-

sponse to the drive for hospitali- 1

zation is one of deﬁnite approval.“
» Speaking from experience, Allen
I-Iolbrook, dean of the school of en-
gineering, = said‘ in behalf of the
plan:
i“I’»m one hundred per cent for
it. In the course of the last four-
teen years I have seen, not once

Designer Speeds Work on Window

Two-thirds of the work on the medallion casement windows, senior
memorial to be constructed in the alcove above the Fifth avenue entrance,
will be completed before one piece of glass is put into place.

An actual size sketch, explains Dr. John Weber, ‘secretary of the

Univerrsitygﬁrst is made from'the
original drawings of the artist.

Each of the 100 pieces of stained
and tinted glass are cut and colored
to match the design beforethe act-
ual construction of the window be-
gins.

A staff of expert craftsmen and
artists work under Charles J. Con-
nick, designer of the windows who
also originated the elaborate and
intricate designs of the Heinz
Chapel medallions.

A group of artists copy the de-
tails of the orginal drawing and en-
large them to actual size. After
Connick checks the sketch, glass
cutters ﬁt the pieces to coincide
with the drawing and the glass is
stained to the desired colors.

The assembling of the glass, “like
a jig-saw puzzle except that the
pieces are numbered,” requires ex-
pert precision and extreme care.
Strips of lead cement the glass
panes in place.

The design of the windows will
represent springtime-——modernized.

A baseball player, a track man,
a hunter and a ﬁsherman will be
pictured in the center of the dia-
mond shaped medallion which rep-
resents the “masculine attitude.”

The “feminine suggestion” will be
represented by “birds, flowers, and
slender growing things.”

Both medallions, the masculine
on the left and the feminine on the
right, will be surrounded by panes
of tinted water glass, semi-trans-
parent and etched with other pic-
tures of spring. .

At the base of each window the
class inscription will be etched.

The ‘Weiss’
Owl Swoops Today

Over Pitt Campus

The 1940 Owl will blink its eyes
for the ﬁrst time on the University
campus at precisely 9 o’clock this
morning, says Dick Weiss, C40, edi-
tor.

University students may obtain
their copies of the year book in 828
Cathedral any time beginning to-
day. A receipt must be presented,
and any amount due may be paid
at that time.

A few extra copes have been
printed, according to Sam White-
man, BA40, business manager of
the Senior Publication. Any stu-
dent who neglected to put in his
reservation for the Owl may pur-
chase a copy of the private lives of
Polly and Peter Pitt for the sum
of $5.

To All Graduating Seniors:

The administration each year
orders engraved Commencement
announcements to send to other
colleges and universities. This is
merely a formal announcement of
the time and place of the Com-
mencement exercises, and does not
contain the names of the members
of the graduating class.

For the convenience of the grad-
uating seniors we have ordered a
limited quantity of these announce-
ments which are now on sale,
while the supply lasts, at the Uni-
versity Bookstore, at 75 cents per
dozen.

at a number of other Pennsylvania
schools.

The hospitalization plan, co-spon-
sored by the Pitt News and Student
Health Service, was seen to have
two features that, should the plan
be adopted and supported, would

give to the University:

1. A cheaper method of group

hospitalization than is had, at
most.,se,l:1o,pls,,, includj;ng..those who
have similar hospitali-zation plans.
, 2. ‘A more functional health
preservation program than is bad
by any school whose health‘serv-
ice was studied—.one‘that will do
more, materially, for‘ the patient
than any "existing hospitalization
plan that has been investigated in
the survey.

The survey,Which took-into con-
sideration the health’ services of
Duquesne university,‘ Carnegie
Tech, Temple -university, Pennsyl-
vania State college, and the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, showed
that the proposed hospitalization in-
surance fee of $2.50 is as low as any
of the health fees alone of the above
‘schools, none of which has a com-
plete hospitalization plan.

At Duquesne, each student is as-
sessed $2.50 as a “health fee,” in-
cluding only an examination, and
the consultation of a physician, but
no hospitalization. An examina-

Parke to Act as Head
‘ Of“"Gronp Next’ Year

Encountering little opposition
from the minority of Independents
in Men’s Council, the Fraternity
party swept a complete slate of
candidates into ofﬁce last night at
the annual election of oﬂicers.

Donald Parke, C41, a member of
the group for the past year and a
members of Kappa Sigma fraternity,
was elected president of the men’s
governing group. He succeeds Hen-
ry DeRocher, M40, Pi Kappa Alpha,
retiring president. M

Originally slated for the top post
was Alvin Ludwig, BA41, Theta
Chi, but his election to the presiden-

_cy of Interfraternity Council caused

him to withdraw and make room

for Parke.

, Vice president of Men’s Council
for 1940-41 will be Richard Gardi-
ner, C41, Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He
was to have gotten the oiﬁce of sec-
retary, before the shift was made.
Parke was to have been vice presi-
dent.

George Hill, BA42, Phi Delta
Theta, will be secretary of the
group. Andy Marshall, BA43, The-
ta Chi, was elected treasurer.

Men’s Council supervises the cus-
toms program for freshman and
transfer men and tmaintains the
used book exchange at the beginn-
ing of each semester. All proceeds

We Preview 1940 Yearbook

By Robert C. Adams

Polly and Peter Pitt arrive at the University this
morning in the pages of the 1940 Owl.

Labeled last October by the Pitt News as a pub-
licity stunt for the Owl, Polly and Peter Pitt have
turned Out to be two mythical Pitt students who furn-
ish an excellent theme for the liveliest yearbook which
has appeared on the University campus.

Streamlined is the word to describe the 1940 Owl,
looking at the University through the eyes of Polly
and Peter and reproducing an informal picture of

student life.

Owl editor Dick Weiss need have no qualms about
his “good natured, tongue-in-cheek, modern treat-
ment” of University life. This year’s Owl combines
excellent I3h0’f0gI“aphy, clever layouts, and effective
use of C0101“ int‘) 3 Sp1‘i?;ht1y, interesting yearbook. The

1940 Owl is a ﬁrst-rate job.

Writeups on the campus organizations are short
and snappy, decidedly on the informal side. Mem-
bers of Interfraternity Council, according to the Owl,
“Issue booklets and have dinners and make rules and
have dinners and break rules and have dinners . . .”

We like this attitude toward campus groups, in spite
of the nasty things the Owl says about the Pitt News.

Best feature of this year’s book is the photography.
Campus views and candid shots of students and fac-
ulty make the Owl a personalized book instead of a
University prospectus.

Prize for the highest number of appearances in the
Owl should go to Dandy Dick Cassiano, whose hand-
some mug decorates the ODK Senior Award page,
graces the Hall of Fame, sneaks into several informal
classroom and campus scenes, hits the football action

pages, appears as a member of Pitt’s cafe society,

and grins from a TWA advertisement.

Even the endless rows of senior pictures are given
a fresh touch by including informal campus scenes
on each page. But the names and activity records of
the seniors are blocked into unattractive masses of

type which no one but the seniors and their parents

should be.

will read. And that, the Owl staff will tell us, is as it

Peter and Polly Pitt have broken away from tra-
ditional yearbook style, and made the 1940 Owl a

top post and consequently given
the vice-presidency was David
Tucker, 041, Independent party
choice.

Other ofﬁcers elected by the

ﬁrst meeting of the new assem-

bly last night were: Gene Pyle, C41,

C41, treasurer. The remaining

and Fred Robie,Ed41.

The composition of the executive
committee is three Fraternity and
three Independent members. This
division was assured by the 19-11
representation of the two groups on
the assembly. The ten faculty votes
were the deciding factors in the
election, as was expected.

Found: A Remedy
For ‘llospitalitis’  

Immediate reaction to our campaign to bring a
student hospitalization plan on campus has been
unaniinous approval by student leaders and Im-
vers.it_v oﬁicials.

That, this was to be expected was at. no time
doubted inasniur-li as this plan would make possible
one of the inostcoinpletc student health services in
the C—,;,mv1fn~~,r/a\'ailablc at a lllllllllllllll of expense to
the student.

A rough survey of such services in neigjliboring
Pennsylvania. colleges clcar.ly_deinoiistrates the su-

periority of the proposal under consideration here.

In other schools it is coininon practice to assess each .

student a certain fee for services of a school phy-
sician. At Pitt such medical attention is included

in the price of tuition.

‘Another revelation from the survey concerns the

a,va.ilability and cost of ‘(hospital service at other
schools.“ No other institution boasts so complete a
program of‘ anything_ approa_c'l1i1'ig the insigniﬁcant
feegof $2.50 a semester. . M _ I

But. the merits of the plan do not lie in the fact
that Pitt will be the pioneer in a new ﬁeld of
providing “ extensivebut inexpensive” hospital ‘care
The real issue is that some form of
protection is needed.

for students.

‘Typical of the remarks pi.-ai-siiig student hos-
pitaliza,tion this week was that of Dean Holbrook of
the Schools of Engiiiceriiig and Mines who said:

‘:‘-In the ‘course ofthe last fourtceii years I have
seen, not once but niany times, students in ‘serious
difficulty ‘because of lack of funds for hospitaliza-
tion.~ That’s why I’m 100 per cent for the proposed

That ’s why we are too. That ’s wliy we not only
endorse group hosp.ital_iza.t.ion, but urge every stu-
dent to sign up for the program.

A Newcomer to this Page ,
Sees ‘The American Empire’

By Edgar Beige]

   

The United States is due to expand on a large scale
during the next few years.

This is the consensus among economists, political
scientists, and historians in the University, all of whom
are turning internationalist in a big way—contrar_v to
recent trends in American public and college student
opinion.

I met two University political scientists lolling on
the steps of Carnegie Library last Friday afternoon.
The triple-blitzkrieg was just being advertised in
America. With a basis of many years of study and
observation, with a sketchy outline of what was hap-
pening at that moment, and with a freedom of thought
and imagination, we conjectured .

Mystical Americana

To begin with, the old swinging-door German drive
through Belgium——now extended to I-Iolland—has been
greatly modified since 1914.
tack were revealed in the Pittsburgh Pressof last
November 12 (complete maps and all!) when the
“triple oﬂensive against Belgium, Holland, and France,
with the object of ﬂanking the Maginot Line . . and
cutting off the Channel_ports”' was not carried out as
scheduled. The Gerinanattacl«: of May 10——predicted

for that date by Oswald Villard in his “Inside, ‘Ger-

many” printed last January, and later substaiitiated by

Pearson & Allen——-has substantially followed the plans

printed last November. V
While the headlines have been confusing, the Ger-

man method is obvious: I) aerial bombardment. of the «

enemies’ interiors, especially centers of troop concen-
tration and communication; 2) peppering enemy troops
with aerial machine-gun operations; 3) frontal land
attacks led by mechanized units. This orthodox method
was used in Poland and Norway, just as it is being used
in Belgium and Holand. Allied resistance may check
the land advance, but the entire venture depends
upon the success of aircraft. Indeed German aircraft
may be the deciding factor in the world’s history dur-
ing the next few years, for by destroying Allied land
positions--by sheer air superiority-—-the Germans can
pave the way for subsequent land invasion of the low
countries and France, driving through to the Atlantic.

Last June ‘l\/Iajor Elliot reported Germany had 8,000
airplanes, and was building 1,000 a month; France and
Britain, he contended, had 6,000, and could replace 800
a month (since supplemented by Americanproduction).
At that rate Germany may put 10,000 aircraft in the
air at one time, for a mass attack anywhere.

of E’urope——whi.ch is a 'disti’inictpVossibility, iconsiderinig
German activity during the past six years. Or let
us just suppose that the Italo-German alliance is de-

feated after four or ﬁve years ofstiff ﬁghting. At any ii

rate the British and French will either be obliterated
or so weakened that they no longer will control: 1)
their world naval supremacy; 2) their ,world,empires,

International expert Edward M. "Earle (Princeton) be-y

lieves “it may be virtually impossible to preserve the
,Br,itish, Frenchaiid Dutch colonial empires ~i-'"ega.rdless

of the ultimate military decision”. Such a decline will

place the United States in the unique position of deal-
ing with and/or controlling all of the non.-European
world. Consequences may well parallel the following
outline:

1. To save their navies, the British‘ and French
governments, sooner than scuttle or surrender them,
would transfer them to American control and/or
ownership. ,.

2. The British Commonwealth of Nations would
dissolve. Canada would join Greater America—for
the United States would meanwhile form. a Greater
American Confederation, incorporating all of the re-
public of the North, South, and Central Americas.’ ..

3. The locale of world history would become’en-
trenched in the Paciﬁc basin (having shifted from the
ancient Mediterranean basin to the modern Atlantic
basin to the future Paciﬁc basin). , Subsequently
Australia and New Zealand——both defenseless against
any land or sea invasion from, for instance, Japan——
would adhere to the American union as part {of ,our
Paciﬁc orbit of protection. '

4. Three of the, continents, the two .Amcricas and
Australasia (most of it) are accounted for. Africa
would be a sore spot. All of the continent could well
be abandoned to European. exploitation. The Germans
and Italians would push southward tothe desert. The
American confederation could most proﬁtably support
independence for all of Africa--in an attempt to pre-

vent fascist invasion, (of all of that continent) if only
to protect South America from proximity to attack
from" the west African coast. '

5. American isolationists shy from inquiry. into
European problems. Clarence Streit’s plan should
therefore be revised. Instead of a world federation to
protect the ‘staggering British and French empires,
there should be a non-European world federation to
protect the new, fresh American empire, thus 1) elim-
inating any further historical concern for the dith-
culties of the French and British by relieving them
of their empires; 2) forgetting European war prob-
lems by leaving Europe to become an isolated, self-
sufficient, happy, geographical unit, divorced from
seeking places-in-the—sun, colonial problems, and wars
for world domination; 3) placing the United States in
its obvious historical role during the coming New Era.

6. Thefnon-European world, would have one prob-
lem: .Tap2ui.' But by offering Japan several billion
dollars worth of gold bullion, by furnishing them
greater raw material resources-—Which would be di-
vorced from European control, and by enforcing our
gifts with the Grand Navy, the United States could
easily solve the Oriental problem. At the same time

America’s stake in the Far East could be realized———=

China could be rehabilitated and industrialized by
Japan and the United States.

of Australasia could easily be protected by American
sea power, in cooperation with a placated Japan. The
American Council Institute of Paciﬁc Relations be-
lieves that “America holds the balance in the Far
East; what America does or does not do in 1940 may
determine the destiny of the peoples of the Pacific.”
So this World War II may be seen as the American
messiah. Europe may disentangle itself from the world,
and allow the American nations to play their trumps,
which they have unknowingly been holding for twenty
years. The great American Empire will see peace for
many generations, while the erstwhile European part-
ners in plunder will meanwhile be stabbing each other
in the back. Should Europe ever again revitalize itself
to face Greater America, we will control six seas, and
receive the support of ﬁve continents.

‘Big J eff’ Advice ‘
. To the Love~lori1
By’ Bob Cestrich
More of Big Jeff.

On my way to Big Jeﬁ”’s the other
night, I wandered. a little after
dusk along the country road which
leads through the very center of
Deep Glen woods. As I tramped
along, it was my misfortune to pass

- several parked cars causing young

men and women to disentangle
themselves hurriedly and glare
half-deﬁantly, half-guiltily at my
retreating back, and this led me to
thinking on one of the major prob-
lems of youth.

It caused me to thinkthpat it was
a crying shame that youngsters in
love should have to feel and be-
have like criminals. It caused -me

to think that this furtivity was en- _

gendered by the narrow-minded
arrogance of parents who thought
they should both choose their off-'

 spring’s mate and the hour of inat-
It made «me wonder that hvu-’

ing.
man memory could be so faulty. as

to not be able to recall. its own .

youthful experience, and proﬁt by
the recollection through the free-
dom it might give to sons and
daughters .

Tough Reasoning _

Tliis was tough reasoning and I
feltthat I should get someone else’s
opinion on the matter,. so I hurried

‘on to Big _Jeff’s.
I found him sprawled on his back
in the middle of the lawn. ‘He sur-
veyed me with mild distaste. “You,”
he informed me, “should take a. hint.
_A locked gate is 1 not an ,invitation
to ape-likeathletics but rather a
notice that the owner of said gate
desires to be considered absent from
home. What’s,on your mind?”

, ‘‘I’ve got to write another col-
umn,” I told him, “and need help.”
I explained the situation briefly.
Jeff nodded and ﬁlled his pipe with
fingers that trembled. .

Remembering

“This hits me between the eyes,”
he said slowly, “I was just thinking
of my (own marriage before you
came. That’s why the gatewas
locked. Your problem is youthful
inarriage, isn’t it? You want to
know whether or not young people
should marry in spite of economic
dif‘ﬁcu].ties and in the face of par-
ental objection. My answer is . .
yes, if they are sure. You see .
marriage is the molding of one per-
sonality with another until both are
in tune with the universe. This
molding process is best carried on
in youth, because habits, l.ike ce-
ment, harden with time. I know
very well what two people can
mean to each other . . Because
twenty years ago this spring I mar-
ried Her. Eight years ago,
she got tired and went away.

Insigniﬁcant Man,

“It was a night just like this. I
remember coming out of the house
and walking up to our hill so I could
think. I hadn’t been to bed in for-
ty-eight hours. I lit a cigarette and
watched the red beacon. light over
town, ﬂash on and off, on and off,
like it’s doing tonight, and every-
thing was quiet. So very quiet. I
got to thinking about the stars up
there shining night after night, al-
we..Vs in the same old way in the
same old place and I got to ﬁguring
how insignificant a man was. com-
pared with them. The thought was
comforting and yet it scared iris,
and I wanted to tell Marion. I stood
up and called her—-once, t.wicc—-
thrce times. She didn’t answer me
and for the first time I really under-
stood what Dr. Saunders had
meant when he said that she was

_ . dead.”

Big Jeff sat very still, as The
Spectator, much like the Arabs,
folded his tent and stole away into
the night.

Severe Slump
Grips Panther
Golfing Team

Linksmen to Attempt
Revival with Victory
Over Navy Saturday

By Vince Matera

While the Hot. Hoyas of
Georgetown were taking the
steam out of five Eastern Inter-
c,ollegiat.e Golf association teams
at Oakmont last week-end, the
Pitt. Panthers st‘r11gglecl through
three of their worst matches this
year.

Bill Kramer posted the ﬁrst loss
for Pitt as he went 16 holes before
bowing to Penn’s Bunnell, 3 and 2.
In-the second foursome Jim Ken-
nedy went 17 holes with D. Crosson,
winning, 2 and 1. The Panthers
made it two on this one by taking
the best ball, 1 up. .

Penn Triumphs

The Jungle Cats took two more
points out of the next foursome.
‘Bob Seybold defeated Moore, 3 and
2, and H. Crossen stopped Bill Reil-
ly on the eighteenth green, 1 up.
The Panthers made their two by
taking the best ball, 3 and 2.

Muend downed Homer McClin-
‘took. 6 and 5, Huredutt licked Lar-
ry Geyer, 4 and 2. and Penn took
the best ball, 6 and 5, to clinch the
‘foursome and the .match.

The Panthers weren’t expected to
do much against Georgetown and
prediction rang true as Jim Ken-
nedy defeated Harris, one up on
the nineteenth hole, for Pitt’s only
point. '

-Hoyas Clean Up

In the same foursome former
Ilational Collegiate champ Johnny
Burke stopped Kramer,6 and 5,.and
the Hoyas took the best ball,’ 3
and 2, . .

When the next foursome was
over, Pitt dropped ‘three more
markers. Shea downed Seybold, 4
and 3, Galvin.;stoppe.d Reilly, 2 up,
and best ball went to Georgetown,
4 and 3. p , ,

The_ Hoyas made another clean

C intock lost to Sh_arkey, 6 and 5,
Geyer was stopped by Higgins, 6

_the last hole, 2 up. _

Bill C-Reilly went 17 holes with
Rockwood but lost, 2 and 1, and
Selby stopped Seybold, 5 and 4.

Wolverines Appear as Sturnbling Black
To National Prestige for Panthers

Captain Ralph Schwarzkopf, heir-
apparent to the college two mile
throne vacated by Greg Rice of
Notre Dame. tops the list of big
names. . d

On the basis of Pitt perform-
ances in the Penn State meet last
Saturday, it seems safe to say that
the Wolverines will know they are
in a battle every inch ofevery
event.

Larry Tregoning, the blonde jun-
ior power—machine, indicated that
the things predicted for him after
his sensational sophomore perform-
ances in the Penn Relays last spring
are ﬁnally becoming realities.

Trigger ripped off a 50.2 quar-
ter on the slow Stadium oval with
no competition. With the natural
speed he possesses along with his
robust, six feet-two inch frame, he
has all the physical equipment
necessary for a champion quarter
miler. Added conﬁdence in himself
should put him "over the top.

Happy Stickel’s sudden improve-
ment in the 220 yard low hurdles
bolsters the aggregation’s all-around
strength. The handsome sophomore
clicked with a 24.4 second clocking,
ﬁve-tenths of a second from Ken
Ryden’s University record.

In wining the pole vault last Sat-
urday sophomore Dusty Rhoades
took but three jumps. He passed
up the ﬁrst leap at 11 feet six
inches, and made 12, 12-6 and 13
on his ﬁrst attempts. Vic Pic-'I<ard"s
University mark of 13 feet 71/2
inches won’t stand much longer.

("oat-l1 Ralph Mitcrling and

blit2:krieg when they invade the
l'nite(l States Naval acadeniy
Saturday to meet the equally un-
successflil Navy nine.

Pitt will be out to capture its
second win of the season. On the
basis of their respective showings
this year, the Panthers should rate
something of a favorite. Both
teams have been defeated several
times, which should make for a
closely fought contest.‘

Four Lettermen

Former Philadelphia Athletic in-
ﬁelder Max Bishop is in charge of
the sailors and will have his team
in top condit.ion for the Pittites.
Bishop’s record as coach at Annap-
olis showns 15 victories against 13
losses. — A

The"backbone _of the Middie nine
is built on four ‘lettermen. f__Return-
ping. fromithe 1939 tiearnl are ‘Captain
Bob Wooding, Dick Niles, Andy An-
derson, ancl'Lefty Schoenbaum. All
but Wooding are regulars" on‘ this
year’s club. S A A '’

Win Only One if 

Up to the present time the Mid-
shipmen have -been successful in
only one baseball war, that against
Dartmouth -college. Among those
dealing, the. future admirals set-
backs were Vermont, Harvard,
l\/Iichigan, Fordham, Georgetown,
and. North Carolina,  , __ _

Mainstays for the Middies are
pitcher Schoenbaum and catcher
Anderson. Schoénbaum has per-
formed well in his work this season
while ...catcher Anderson is one of
the leading hitters for the Navy
team. '

Pitt will be forced to tighten its
defense if ityhopes to register its

second win of the season. In all the ,

games this year, with the exception
of the Michigan fray, the Navy team
has played exceptionally 'well. de-
fensively. The‘ Panthers on the
other hand-have been bothered by

In all probability the same team
which almost upset a favored ‘Penn
'State nine will represent the Panth-
ers Saturday afternoon. Although
no deﬁnite word’ has been recieived
concerning the pitcher, it is expect-
ed that southpaw Andy .J..0hnS0I1
will hurl for the Mitterling team.

The probable starting line-up for
the Naval Academy is as follows:
Clark, third base; Blue, second
base; Niles,‘cent.érﬁeld; Werner, left

Seems as if the Delta Tau Deltas throw some kind of a party every
Saturday. ’Last‘w‘eefkc__x_id it was an, all» day affair at South Park and as
usual included the girl-friends of the Delts. In. the afternoon there was
a. -mushball gamc_.,betwcgm ‘the, ﬁne,-lance boys,  $119. boys. who go

gteady.

Needless to say, the former’ could better devote themselves to

the game and for’ this reason won. After that there was dinner and an

evening under the stars.

 Hopeless Pirates Bring Hope

‘Traitor’ Lielilich Deserts Bucs’ Sinking Ship

By Gertrude Lieblich

Whenever we feel discouraged,
we look at the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Then we feel much better. Little
else in this serio-comic wo:ld is as
absurd as the sight of grown men
in knee-pants racing between white
markers. Where is it all getting
them? And how fast?

Now, we know this is not the
proper attitude to take toward the
venerable sport of baseball. And,

to be truthful, the thing that irri-
tates us is that they run the bases
so badly.

Ever since the 1938 fall ﬁasco,
when the Pirates shot a six-game
lead, we have cared for the Pirates
less and less. Oh-ho, you say, we’re
the kind of a fan that supports the
team only when they're winning.
Of course. Why else should they
play the silly game? After all, they
spend all afternoon working at the
thing, and what have they achieved

by 5:15? A couple of numbers on
a scoreboard.

Since the Pirates destroyed a
young girl’s ideals in 1938, we see
little in baseball but the triumph
of routine thinking. It’s this way.
In 1938 the Pirates had their one
big chance—-and they refused it
with gusto. Ever since, they have
been rounding the bases and hitting
long ﬂies with a dogged determina-
tion to make the same mistake they
have always made.

It is understood, of course, that
we wouldn’t attack the logic of base-
ball if the Pirates ever got out of
the second division. In that case,
we would regard baseball as the
highest type of ﬁne competitive
sport, designed to bring out the best
qualities in man and beast.

George Simeonoif, ’37, has set the
pace for this year’s senior subscrip-

75-cent reduction from the regular
$2.25 subscription rate, will be giv-

en to graduating seniors. The cou-

F or Greek N ationality Room  

The Greek marbles, upholding
the nationality room tradition of
slipping "treasures from countries
on the brink of war, arrived at the
University Friday.

The Polish room painting, the
Lithuanian linens and‘ oak Wains-
coating, the coat of arms from
Prague Uuniversity, and the'draw-
ing-‘of the Norwegian ~room—al1 won
a race with war blockades.

The marbles, which weigh 2,500
pounds, will be unpacked and
checked. This will take two or
three days, claims Mrs. Ruth C.
Mitchell, adviser to the nationality
rooms, because of the weight and
value, requiring careful handling.

The shipment, which left Greece
April 2, includes two single shafted
white columns and rectangular slabs
of marble carved by Constantine
Mastoris, expert marble carver in
Athens.

Designed by John Travlos,
Athenian architect who is “the
ﬁnest architect of classical Greek
style in the world,” the marbles
will be erected as soon as possible
to facilitate completion of the room
before the fall semester begins.

i’I‘hg;.',GI:‘-e,ek..Roem«committee pur-'
chased the marbles from one of the
finest Greek quarries, and the Gre-
cian government gave $1,250 for
the carving.

1 One of the greatest difficulties in
shipping the marbles was getting
insurance. The American Express

company, however, ﬁnally accepted
