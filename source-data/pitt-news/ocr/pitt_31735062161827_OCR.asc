.“Racism is not something to be
intellectually considered but
fought,’-’ said Kwane_SalterA,
director of the University -of
Wisconsin’s Afro-American, center.

Salter made his remark yes-

A terday as guest speaker during a

teach-in conducted by the Univer-
sity.Senate’s Ad hoc Committee on
Racism in. the Student Union
Ballroom.

Salter said to consider a racist
attitude, as ‘something unusual or
abnormal is a_‘~‘mistaken notion.”
“Anyone who is white and is not a
racist is abnormal. Racism is"not a

psychological flaw, not a _ment_al «

quirk, not an abnormality.” ‘ A

According to Salter, racism
fostered by our capitalist system,
has penetrated virtually every level
of our culture. 1ABu‘t “the
university,” he says, “is the main
culprit.”

An institution of learning which

i’ is supported by public taxes, said

University of Wisconsin’s Afro--

Otherwise, he reasoned, there is

“taxation without’ representation.
“The fact that there are 25,000

students at Pitt and only 1,000

- blacks shows racial bias,” he said.

The speaker also pointed out a

current -“resurgence of ’ scientiﬁc g
, racism.”

institutions as well as the President
of the United States, who, he said,
has “completely, sold out to the

“Jensen,” he said, “is an
advisor on the government’s ‘Head
Start’ program.” He added that a
Stanford University professor who
proposes “Negro women be paid
for voluntary sterilization” sits on
the National Science Foundation.

Salter then discussed racial. bias
in testing. , He described IQ tests as

Non—resicient Tuition Rates:A,,L

« ’ BY LEE MARKOVITZ

' ‘Members of‘ the Pennsylvania

House Sub-Committee on Higher
Education held an open hearing

Wednesday to her views on a“

proposal to make non-resident
students’ tuition twice that of
Pennsylvania residents.

The proposal, House Bill 733,

would make mandatory for state

colleges and universities “the fee
charged per credit for non-resi-

dents of Pennsylvania for tuition‘

shall be at least two times the fee
charged,‘for residents of Pennsyl-
vania.”

At present,

Pitt’ out-of-state

' students pay $980 per term while

Pennsylvanians pay $500, however,

 the per credit rate for‘non-resident

undergraduates is $75 compared to
$35 for residents.

The per, credit rate /for non-resi- '

dent graduates is $90 and for.

Aresidents $44. The bill would make

Court Records Dispute

Pitt's Claim in Sex Suit

BY MARC’ RUDOLPH -

Court records reveal, contrary to
University claims, that Dr. Sharon
Johnson was denied access to the
composition of the Executive
Committee of the Board of
Trustees. f '

Atty. Charles Arensberg, lawyer
for the University, stated Johnson
was never denied access to the
names of members of the Executive
Committee. This reporter called
the University and was given the
names of Committee members.
However, Johnson was deniedthis
information, according to files

i which are public record. ,

A motion to produce this

information . was presented by

Johnson's lawyers. The motion
states: '

‘fPlaintiff counsel Sylvia Ro-
berts. Esq. requested production of
these documents in the course of-
Depositions taken Oct. 2, 3, and 4
of 1973 of Dr. A William Rea,
chairman of the Board of Trustees,
and Dr. Wesley Posvar, Chancellor
of the University of Pittsburgh.
Upon such ’ requests Defendents
stated a Motion to Produce was
necessary." A

The motion requests the Univer-
sity produce certain documents.
Listed among the requested docu-
ments was “an accurate -listing of
the Board of Trustees committees, .

rights and responsibilities of a
publisher.”  Z ‘

Approved by the Committee
October 1.8, the ‘proposal V went
before a Board meeting first on
October 31 and again last Wednes-

Tom‘ Smith, the statement reaf-
firms an inherent duty of the
‘Allocations Committee so’_there will

A‘ be no misunderstanding about

their functions in "the future.
“There were conflicts last year in
the investigation of publications’
budgets,” Smith said. “We asked
questions in our-interviews with
publication representatives, and
sometimes they felt it infringed

'- upon their editorial policy.

He related last year's struggle
with Ideas and Figures, the student
literary magazine. “They wanted
to change their cover to a gloss and
we asked them why. For some
unknown reason they got upset and
said we didn't have the authority to
ask that.” »

Smith said the Committee does
have the right to check into the
publications because they are .
funded by Student Government.
He listed three reasons for the
proposal. _. A ' .

“First to make ‘clear that we have

’ the right. It was being argued that

we didn’t have the right to make
recommendations about the publi-
cations. ‘ :  A"
“Anothe1"reason is for the benefit
of future Allocations comrnittees.

It is difficult fora new Alloca_tAionsA

Committee to understand what
their duties_are.. This is so new

members can look at the by-laws’

and see what they can or cannot

5 do."' Smith explained.

He‘ said a third reason was for the
publications themselves.

when they come befofe the
Committee. Some people have
misunderstood what our functions
are and we’d like to clear it up.”

/I _ Smith said the policy could not

affect editorial policy because the
wording “.in..'the disbursement of
funds" precedes and therefore
clariﬁes the point of “publishers’
responsibilities."

The proposal reads those publica-
tions with adequate staffs and with
ideas must be
given the opportunity to communi-

cate these to the student body, and

that these investigatory and evalu-
atory processes will make this
possible. .. ‘

The group raised specific objec-
tion to the Miller-Analogy Test
which is currently administered at
Pitt and elsewhere for admission to
some graduate schools. Campbell
said he found questions on this test
to be particularly biased with
respect to students’ ethnic back-
grounds.

Dichter-asked, “I don’t think your

think the Undergraduate Academic
Review is putting out up to par.

“There is an exorbitant amount of
AP (Associated Press) stories in
your paper that in no way beneﬁts
the University. I can read that stuff
in the New York Times.

“Here we have a chance .to get
problems out to the students and
then we have a Student Govern-
ment article in one column on page
three. ‘ '

Dichter stressed_ ‘the ‘proposal

wouldWonl_y affect the publications_

in ‘terms of quality._V‘TWe aren’t
saying we want this article in your
newspaper or yearbook,- but we
want these kinds of articles.— We
want quality.”

Pitt News Editor Sharon Sexton
felt the ‘ proposal may give the‘
Committee the power to exercise
publishers rights over the publica-
tions.

“They argue this is not their
intent. However, their motion can
potentially give the Allocations
Committee authorization to censor
publications. Their proposal is an
overt threat to our independence
and to free speech, ” Sexton said.

‘ Student Government Board Presi-

dent Rege Kaufman was asked
why, since the proposal was passed
by Committee October 18, the
information wasn't relayed to the

~ editors until.Wednesday.

“Had I thought this was being
acted upon right away, I would
have informed the publications.

SGB Urges Lower Pci.iDrinkin/g Age.

BY DREW PROVAZNIK
A resolution supporting a lower
state drinking age was passed by
the Student Government Board
(SGB) Wednesday, relating to two

. House of Representatives bills.
One bill would lower the age to 18,

the... other to 19.

The SGB resolution favors: “any
legislation of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania that lowers the
drinking age from its present
status, 21 years, to a status which
is comparable with and coincides
with=most legal privileges afforded
by citizens of the state.”

Board President Rege Kaufman,
said, “The purpose of ' the
resolution is to show the legislators
that we are concerned about
citizens’ privileges.” D

The resolution will be sent to “all
state representatives and sena-

‘tors, ” _K_aufman added.

Board member Bob Heister

reported on a meeting with
representatives of commuter stu-
dents, Director of the Advising

That was my intent. I’m getting a
memo but to them tomorrow.

“I don’t want to create any crisis.

want to see the best publications on

Dear Editor:~ . . .
.While watching’ the ' election A
returns Tuesday night, I was
surprised and shocked, that there
was no information given con-

for Paul LeBlanc, Socialist Workers
Party _ Candidate for mayor of ‘
Pittsburgh: Although he was (a

— write-in candidate, he was the only
. alternative to Pete Flaherty.

His-
campaign E for ‘mayor’ received
excellent publicity via the Pitts-
burgh Press, speeches ‘before
various organized‘ groups, tele-
vision coverage, and widespread
coverage in various "college news-
papers, includingthe Pitt News.‘ It
seems tome that ‘voters should .
have been aware‘ of the write‘-in
votes for~Paul LeBlanc, if only for
the reason that he was the only
alternative to Mayor Flaherty. Let E
us not forget that Mayor Flaherty
won the Republican and Constitu-
tional Party nominations through a
write-in campaign. In a so-called
democracy which wants to make.’
the citizens politically aware, I feel
that there was no excuse for such
one-sided’ coverage.

Sincerely,

Dear -Editor’: '

[Several recent editions of The
Pitt News have carried complaints
regarding the treatment of appli-.

~ cants for ﬁnancial assistance by the

Pitt Student Aid Ofﬁce. I would
like to add myown experience to
the list.

Although I applied for ﬁnancial
assistance in ‘March, 1973, and

 

"'66 Your: otcouogran lourndiun”

 

  Tlﬁbe

' maintained contact with the Stu-

dent Aid ‘Ofﬁce throughout the
spring and summer months, it was
not until four days after fall classes
had begun that I was notiﬁed that
my request for . funds had been
denied because “...an analysis of
your application indicates that you
do_ not have ﬁnancial need.”

Believing that a mistakemust have
been made, and faced with only 12
days in which to pay my tuition or
withdraw from school, I made an

E appointment (or thought I did) with

Mr. Charles R. Dees. Associate
Dean of Admissions and Student
Aid.

When I appeared for the
appointment, I was told that Mr.
Dees was too busy to see me, i.e.,
‘he had “another commitment”,

B‘ but that I might ‘speak to a staff
member concerning my problem.

The staff member,‘ who had
reviewed my application, said he
had rejected it on the grounds that,

despite the low personal income

claimed on the form, the accom-

panying copy of my 1972 Federal,
' A income tax return indicated sub-
stantially higher earnings.

ever, after I explained to him that
the latter‘ statement’ was based
upon the calendar year, 1 January -

cerning the number of votes‘ cast Lg. 31 December: 1972 [the first Six '

(months of which I had been

employed], while the former
covered only the 1972-73 academic
year [during which" I was not
employed], he saw the light and

_agreed to reprocess my application
. as quickly as possible. 

Three ‘weeks ‘later, having
received nothing regarding my

"application, Iagain visited the

How.- 5

Student Aid Ofﬁce and was told
that an offer of financial assistance,
in the form of a National Direct

Student Loan. had been mailed to it

me 9 days earlier. Since I had not
received it, however. a secretary
typedme a duplicate letter which I

,' signed and left at the Ofﬁce with

the understanding that I should
return in one week to pick up my
promissory note. A week later
when I returned for the note, ofﬁce
personnel were unable to locate it,

nor could they produce the signed ,

letter of acceptance or any of the
contents of my application ﬁle. All
had quite mysteriously disappear-
ed! . '

Finally, with _a new promissory
note safely deposited in .the
Student Accounts Office,’ I then,
waited 2‘/2 weeks before my check
arrived, a month and a half after
the beginning of the fall term. As a
result of these ridiculous delays-, I

was forced to borrow a substantial .

sum, at a higher rate of interest,
from another source in order to
continue my education. Conse-
quently, I am planning to take
steps to try to bring about some
changes in the way
students are dealt with by the
Student Aid Ofﬁce, and I would
welcome the supportof other
persons who have suffered similar
mistreatment and wish to do
something ‘about it. I can be
reached during weekdays at ext.

Man wanted a faster way of
traveling, to feel the wind beating
against his face. So he invented
the car not realizing the wind that
would be beating against his face
would be unbreathable. '
But has man learned yet? One
man has. Doctor Frederick
Kaufman has put on his glasses
to read the fine: print behind one
of man’s newest inventions, the
super sonic transport (SST).
Doctor Kaufman, professor at
Pitt, is the only chemist on the
Committee of the National Acad-

oversees Climatic Impact Assess-
ment Program (CIAP), athree-year

Abortion views aired

BY BILL HADUCK .

“Don’t get pregnant.” That,
according to two local doctors, is
the best way to prevent‘ compli-
cations in abortion.

In a debate on the after-effects of
abortion last night, Drs. John
Walker ' and Harry Dailey, both
obstetricians and gynecologists at
local hospitals, agreed “responsi-
ble action” on the part of potential
parents would eliminate a need for

with the membership of those
committees as they arevpresent.”

The University refused to pro-
vide the information requested in
J ohnson’s_ Motion to Produce.- The;
following document states, under

. _ the title "Certification, Under Rules’

37:

‘ “The
certify that the parties in theabove
captioned matter, (Dr. Sharon.
Johnson , ‘and; The University ..of
'Pittsburgh) are unable to come to

Doctor Kaufman is investigating
ecological affects of the SST.
“Mostplanes ﬂy in the tropos-

phere, a fast changing layer of the’

atmosphere. SST’s, however, ﬂy in
the stratosphere.” The stratos-
phere changes much slower than
the lower region. This means "any
substance released in this region
remains for a few years.

“There are two classses of

problems with this. The first is jet‘

fuel contains sulfer which oxidizes
in the air and gives off little
particles, sulfuric acid. « Some
people believe these particles may
have a serious affect in blocking
solar radiation and in changing the
amount of rainfall. I feel these are
greatly exaggerated,"
added.

abortions. “The safest abortion,”
Walker said, “is birth control.”

- The debate, sparked by a series ’

of letters published in the Pitt
News pitted James A. Buzonas,;‘_a
member of Students for Human
‘Life at Pitt and Dailey" against
Roger Johnson, a student_in the
Graduate School of Public Health--
Population Division and Walker.
"One of the things that bothers
me,” Johnson said, “is people
going around talking about abor-
tion without having any conception
of what abortion is all about.”
He‘then informed _the crowd of

about 50 of the types ‘of abortion,_

dangers involved, and cited a
number of sources giving statistics

involving a relatively small number I

of deaths and complications re-

- sulting from abortion. »

Taking a" pr;-.a_b~o—i:t_iori stand,
Johnson noted the doctoring of
statistics that he said occured in
zanti-abortion literature. ' He called

“You can’t prove anything by’

He said however, “You can’t_say

Anti-abortionist Buzonas said no .

The second class is the one Doctor
Kaufman is working on. ‘

“Planes give off nitrogen oxides
[NO]. Regularplanes spew NO in
troposphere, where it is
constantly changing; no. harm is
done. SST’s, however, spew out
NO in the stratosphere where there
is little change so it just stays
there.” Kaufmann went on to
discuss theldangersn ‘of nitrogen
oxides. _

“There is a ‘layer of ozone in the
stratosphere. .Ozone absorbs‘ the
ultraviolet rays of the sun. Without
ozone, these rays would strike the
Earth and burn everything.

“NO catalystically decomposes
the ozone. If 500 present-day
SST’s-‘would fly on the average of
seven hours a day, they would put

statistics have no relevance, they
do.” He then proceeded to give his
own set of statistics quoting various
studies on abortion.

Dailey and Johnson prevented
the debate from turning into a ‘
questioning of the credibility of
-statistics and evidence by agreeing "
thatabiortion is a risk. ‘ According to

. them, the problem lies in whether .

or not the risk is wanted.

Dailey warned, “-The risk may be '-
IOO to .1 that _complications may . -

arise, but suppose that one is you.” -_

“But,” Walker said," “I could ‘
walk out of here and get hit byga
car. The point is" there is always a ..
risk, no matter "what the circum-
stances.’-’ ' ‘

into the stratosphere enough NO
that by the _1990’s the natural
amount of NO could as much as
double, thus seriously decreasing
the amount of ozone.”

Such ,a decrease would allow
enough ultraviolet rays to strike the
Earth to ‘cause skin cancer.
Kaufman explained that it is
possible to economically reduce the
amount of NO given off by a factor
of ten, but that this will require
several years.— _ _

Other problems withthe SST are
that it uses up more fuel than other
planes, it is uneconomical, and it
uses money that could be used for
more important causes. .

But SST’s possible affect on life
goes deeper than ozone. The extra

[about Ric Masten is: if you are
reading this article on Friday, Nov,
7 ‘10, go see him tonight at 8:00 in the

about a lot of things and his
medium is the oral presentation

I ‘every year creating his experience,
sharing his wisdom, with groups as

‘ Ric is often heard objecting to
 the title of “poet”. He would
"rather be called a “professional

and what happens with them at one
of his readings, as he does about
the poems themselves.

His writings are meant to be read
or sung. He speaks of the “magic”
of oral poetry”--magic because
when poems are spoken the
listener is creative too and becomes
involved. ‘His subjects include
things that everyone can relate
to--love, loneliness, death, suicide,
marriage, social problems, joy in
life--it seems like there are few
themes he doesn’t talk about.

Ane he fits every ‘presentation to
the particular audience before him.

Some of those experiences are
flunking out of five colleges--(a
thing about which he is happy; in
one poem he says schools are fine
for technicians and tradesmen, but
“leave the dreamers be”)--making
$40,000 a year in Hollywood,
“dropping out, building my own
home_ and doing a hippie thing”--
(about which he adds though, “The
way you drop out is to be able to
afford to.”)--working ‘as a day-
laborer with cement, and being
married and raising four children.

Ric has a lot of wisdom to share,

with the world. He's especially

interested in, and devotes time to, '

education and. of course, inter-
personal communications. He says
about the United States that it’s
been a spring and summertime
nation. Now it's time to move into
fall and do some maintenance
work. He feels that we are now
beginning a period of peace in the
world, but that we should
remember that this entire universe
is terminal, and we should all work
toward living a better Now.

One of the qualities_ of Ric
Masten’s work is his use of clear,
strong metaphors. One of the
metaphors I think I’ll always
remember is the one he used for
human society: a hive of bees.
And how does he see himself as a
member of that hive? He says, “I
am it's voice.” lt’s true.

It's a 50/50 deal, good and bad, a
two sided coin. The road is curvy
and bumpy, straight and narrow.
The trip is Carlow College

Strindberg’s The Father.
The Captain [James Berry],
leading character in The Father, is
much like Strindberg himself.

BY JOHN SMITH
ARTS EDITOR

The words “press conference”
or “press luncheon” can bring
niany pictures to the minds of most
news people. They range from the
tedious to the exciting. On
Wednesday afternoon, I was lucky
enough to attend one that fell into

the latter group.
Chinese High Tea was pulled off

‘beautifully at the elegant Squirrel

Hill .home of Mrs. Sydele Kessler.
The affair was neither a conference
or a luncheon, but a gala fete,
complete with champagne and
tasty hor d’ouvres.

Entertainment people from sev-
eral area newspaper, -selected
Heinz Hall and WQED-FM repre-
sentatives, as—well as the lovely
ladies of the _Chinese Opera

‘\ .

Committee composed the guest‘

list. (One of these ladies, I'll call
her Madam X, had me so intrigued
that I could hardly swallow my
shrimp toast. She offered
champagne and spoke of her
project in the most charming
accent. Ah, falling in love again...)

Despite the festivities, this
mini-bash did have a. deﬁnite
purpose. That is, to announce the
meeting of East and West. The
world-renowned Chinese Opera is
hitting Pittsburgh on its American
tour.

The part most of us will not be
able to attend (hopefullyydue to lack
of funds and not lack of interest) is
a benefit for WQED-FM. For a
cost of $50, there will be a
gourmet dinner and wine, courtesy
of the Great Wall Restaurant, with

an exhibit of oriental art from the
collection of Senator Hugh Scott.

The donation also includes tickets
to the performance. November 29
is the date of this extravaganza. If
you can make it for the whole
event, Contact WQED-FM for
reservations.

Students of Oriental culture and
just culture in general will, I think,
find the Chinese Opera fascinating.

It is a total theatrical form that
combines the arts of singing,
dancing and acrobatics, with a

-spectacular array of costumes

and make up. An informative
brochure has also been compiled‘.

This is to familiarize our Eastern
minds with some of the differences
and similarities between Chinese

.drama and the drama we know.

For example, black face represents

a virtuous type, .. and white is
sinister.

Judging from a brief film on the
troupe, I’d say that this promises to
be quite a show. For those of you
who love pageantry and color as
well as fine music and dance, this
gives it out in large helpings.

So, one last word to Madame X,
wherever you are: I look forward to
sipping champagne with you again
in the near future, preferably under
a pagoda, but if that's not possible,
I'll settle for before or after the
Chinese Opera. A

  Martin Mullis Fabulous Furniture  

AUGHTER and the rock
generation have not

rubbed elbows very
frequently. The heavy
social concerns of the mid.-
sixties did not encourage
much humor, while the coun-
ter-culture blossoming of the

I late sixties took itself far too

seriously to allow laughter to
-ja-‘r the sacred trinity of

.peasoe-"love-drugs. The music

and the vibes were so heavy,
-man, that the rock crowd
forgot, how to turn their lips’

’ up into a smile unless it was
, of i the vacant, drug-glazed

variety. . _
5 - Now, however, a sizable
portion of that rock audience

, has reached the 25-35 age’

range. While they’re not

 about to give up rock and

roll in -favor of Tony Bennett»
or Peter Nero, this audience's
sense of humor has returned.
Artists like . Bette Midler,
Randy Newrna-n and London
Wainwright III: are all spik-

hlng their music, with wit.

Even so,. there's an acute

shortage of contemporary. '

 Major
  Upset

BY RON SIEGEL .
SPORTS EDITOR .

   

 

Despite all the Major changes that’. have oc_cured since the last ,-

Pitt-Notre Dame game, the oddsmakers have made Pitt a 21-point

‘ underdog, "not much less than the.spread of lastyear.

Johnny Majors-doesn’t liketo talk about point spreads, but beingja
21-point underdog must upset Majors. It may upset .him enough to
cause a Major upset tomorrow. ' '

Pitt went into, its opening game against Georgia as a 17-point “ I

uiiderdlogjbut outplayedpthe Bulldogs and tied them, 7-7. Notre Dame
is _a much better team than Georgia,‘ but Pitt has improved greatly since
then. a , - . ' ‘ ‘

There are other factors that make the "game ripe for an upset. Pitt

has fared well when rated an underdog, and thedefensive line, which ' ‘

seems to be affected _by this more than the rest’ of the squad, will have
to play at its best if Pitt.\is to win.

' Pitt was favored in its pasttwo outings‘, and the defense did not play .

as well as it did earlier in the season.- Lineback Rod Kirby, who missed

the past two games, will play tomorrow, and the entire defensive unit is -

healthy.
' » , CONDITIONING ,

6 ‘This is a direct result of the conditioning program that the Panthers

' went through in'pre-season drills. In addition to_the extra strength that

I -the team hashad in the fourth quarter, the fact that there" are so few

serious injuries at this late stage of the season is-a tribute to Majors
and his staff. ' '

Pitt has played well in hostile’ environments (usually: road,games,)”

but the’ sellout crowd in the stadium tomorrow ‘will not all be cheering

for Pitt. The long’ student “tunnel” that_will greet the team may be ’
one of the few signsthat the -Cats. are at home, because more than half .

of the fans will be cheering on Old Notre Dame.

~— The ‘Notre Dame fight song is not unfamiliar to any of the Panthers.

Majors has been blaring it at practice sessions this week as one of his

psyching procedures. The last time he played music was in

preparation for the West Virginia game, in which Pitt upset the

Mountaineers. \ A ' '
Last week, the “Major” served Orange drink to the squad in

a preparation for Syracuse. It turned cold this week, so the team finished ‘,
‘ off each workout with a. hot cup of “lrish” stew.

One year ago today,‘ Majors’ Iowa State Cyclones battled a heavily

/ favored Nebraska to a 10-10 tie. That game propelled Iowa State into

its first bowl game ever.‘ A

There will plenty of bowl game people watching tomorrow’s game.
Most of them will be looking at Notre /Dame. If ‘Pitt should pull off an
upset it would immediately bring the Cats serious considerationpfrom

I all of the bowls, including the Major ones. .

The game is the most important contest that Pitt has been in a
decade. Majors has this habit of winning the big ones. If he doesn't
engineer an upset, well, Pitt’s way ahead-of schedule anyhow. If he

* does, the schedule gets accelerated that much more, which would

please many of his hard-working.senio_rs'. One thing’s for certain, Pitt
is vastly improved over last year, and the oddsmakers haven’t noticed
it‘ yet. They will after the game. - '

“We should beat Indiana," said
Coach Bemis of tomorrow’s soccer
game at Indiana University,»and
the booters are going to have to do
just that if they want to keep alive
some hope of a winning season.
There are only two games left in
the season and the Cats have to win
both of those to reach that winning
record.

Bemis finds his position much
reversed now‘ as his team was
two-time defending champs in the

A Western Penn Soccer League and
undefeated in league play. Now

I  iir—§i'HE pm NHE.WS.——Fri"day, November 9, 1973

it’s a little different with the
Panthers being completely out of
the running for West Penn Honors,
beaten by both Edinboro and
Slippery Rock.

The Indiana game, therefore, is a
must to win for the Panthers and
they’re not going to have an easy
time of it. Pitt’s opponent plays a
very physical game but Coach
Bemis says that “Indiana will not
beat us by being physical.”

Bob Kohlmyer will be well for
the game and should be able to
resume his position at defense. He
and his brother will have their

1

hands full with the Indiana point
men. They, Tremont and F enando
Carriguiry, will have to stop the
“cherry picking” tactics of the
Indiana front men. , '

Indiana has the same offensive
lineupas the Panthers, using the
4-3-3 game plan, only their game is
geared to a shorter ﬁeld. A
controversy with the Indiana coach
has-developed because his field is
ten yards too short on either side
making it a 100-yard ﬁeld instead
of regulation 120. p

The shorter ﬁeld gives Indiana
an advantage because the goalie

can punt ten yards beyond what he
usually would and therefore getting
the ball into his opposition’s zone
and into scoring range for his
forwards. V

“We’re just going to have to

pass the ball, get shots off, and

score,” said Bemis. It seems like
an easy way to win if they can do it.
It’s not Panther talent that’s
lacking and it’s only a question of
whether they can put it all together
for this game. ’

“There is no question that but
that Indiana is going to be up for
this game,” commented Bemis,

“but I also think that we’re going
to beat them.” .

The Panthers had better win this
one, because Penn State is right

around the corner.

The Pitt Law School Rugby Club
will host Indiana (Pa.) Sunday at
the auxliary soccer field behind

Trees Hall, at 2:00 p.m. The match»;-s..

Buffalo, N.Y. —— The Canisius

all was Pitt's distance ace, Nick

The low placing of Pitt's Nick

course Nick developed stomach
cramps that have kept him from
satisfying his potential. This
problem is presently under physi-

Why? Because it’s good business. Helping to clean '

onlygreduces pollution...but just about pays for itself in
