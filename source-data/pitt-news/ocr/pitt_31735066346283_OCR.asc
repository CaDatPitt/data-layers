present this year.

Marge Capous, chairman of the
Midday Series, recently stated
that “. . . the Midday programs
were among the most successful
projects at the University last
year. We feel that its popularity
will be even greater this season.”

The new University Theater, directed by Dr. John Ulrich,
is an attempt for a closer co-ordination of theater activities

in the University and a more‘

compact program of dramatics.

Pit Players will continue to host
the major theatrical productions
as they have donein the past.
Bernard Engel, newly appointed
advisor of Pitt Players, hopes to
emphasize a totally dynamic stu-
dent theater in this year’s pro-
ductions.

Experienced Leader
Engel brings years of experience

with him. He created the role of

Satan (Nicholas) in Archibald
MacLeish’s “J.B.” and has ap-
peared in the off-Broadway pro-
duction of “John Brown’s Body."

He has been director of the
theater activities at the Great
Lakes Naval Base. Engel was also
connected with the Pasedena
Playhouse and Peppertree Theater
in California.

'While studying‘ at Yale Uni-
versity in speech and drama,
Engel toured Europe and per-
formed at the Brussel’s World
Fair. 1

Dr. Allen is advisor of Theater:

Eleven, an experimental dramatic
group on campus. This group will
present three productions each tri-
mester. The first one will be given
October 12, 13 and 14.

ipetition Killed

By Governor

The reading of a letter from the
!Governor's office opened the ﬁrst
A meeting of the University Student
,3 Senate Monday.

The letter was a reply to peti-

moval of the three and aihalf per-
cent sales tax on text books and
' school supplies.

The petition read: “Obtaining an

education is, in itself, a very ex-
pensive proposition, and with the
added burden of the rising cost of
text books and supplies and the
rising percentage of taxes, the
burden is becoming more difficult
, every year."
'§ The Governor's reply stated
I that the revenue of one million
dollars from taxesion texts and
supplies is too important to the
state budget to be eliminated.
He mentioned that the state is.
now three million dollars in the
hole.

Band Banned

_The purpose of the University Marching Band is pri-
A-marily to perform at football games, according to Robert
L. Arthur, director of University Bands.

0 ’ Yet with the increased number of games played on
the ,West Coast this year, few students, band members in-
cluded, expect the‘ University to contribute close to $40,000
to fly the 100 piece band to California. »

But flying to the University of Miami is another story.
Not only is it the ﬁrst game of the season, but the Miami-
Pitt game has merited national television acclaim. To have
the University band perform at halftime before millions of
viewers would not only be good for University public
relations, but would give added prestige -to band members
?who train so hard throughout the season. While not ranked
0 ashigh as football, a good band which has been rated among
the top bands of the country certainly cannot be considered
a detriment to the cause. _

Scheduling difficulties lead off the list of reasons for
the band’s failure to appear at one of the most important
games of the season. First slated to be played sometime in
December, the Miami game was moved to close’ the gap
between football training which ended September 4 and
the first regularly. scheduled game September 23. It was
, felt by some that the three week interval would be too long
for the football players between practiceand act_ual com-
petition. ‘ , A

In addition, the added revenue provided by ABC-TV
for the TV performance prompted the schedule revision.
A national magazine stated that the University stands to
gain $100,000 for its athletic fund for its approval to ap-
pear as the Game of the .Week.- .

Of course, the band itself bowed out of the service be-
cause of the short time it had to reorganize before school
, started in September. Band camp could not be conducted

at iullstrength this year, Arthur stated, because bf the
number of students who had to work during the August
vacation period. 4
’ And so the University of Miami Marching Band will
go ‘through its routines September 16 while four or maybe
six Pitt cheerleaders lead the kids back home in a sound-
less University Chant. V A

The situation described above can hardly be consid-

ered a University crisis, yet it typiﬁes the series of un-

Down With Rhinos : . .

A Broad Subject

By Tom Bry/out
I hate women.
Well, maybe I don’t really hate the femmes, but
a person must have an_answer ready when asked
“Why are ya a conﬁrmed bachelor?”
Theifeminine collegiate population is dedicated
to draining the pocketbooks of
poor male students and ‘main-
taining. an appearance re-
sembling the creature from the
black lagoon‘. 0
Tour any college campus and
observe the stringy, uncombed

ter), the colorless faces, the
green blouses with orange skirts
with maroon _shoes with pale
blue hair (bleached blond’ is
taboo this year), ad inﬁnitum.

Are these girls or circus clowns?

Relax in any studentiunion lounge and watch
the boy-chasing, money-hungry, Coke—drinking,
cigar-smoking felines, slinking about the couches.
Inspect the knobby knees and fat bow legs re-
vealed below those short, short skirts that one
group‘ of university secretaries calls “ridiculous.”

The skirts are ﬁne, but those knees have to go.

Co—eds group themselves into four distinct
classes, found on any university campus:

Bums Thumbs

First, the Brigitte Bardot type. You’ve seen one
of them,~glued to the same chair ‘month after
month, never seemingly attending class; squatting,
pouting, radiating those “come ride with me on my
motorcycle, big boy” expressions, and sucking a
thumb (though not necessarily her own). Only

-Bri.gitte’s famous towel is missing.

Next are those obnoxious lovelies labeled the

' “university ﬂirts,” devoted‘ to teaching‘ conﬁrmed

bachelors that the opposite sex is not as bad as
presupposed. Resoi-ting to few of the Bardot tac-
tics, they endeavor to appear as the innocent (?)

Wherefore The Artist . . .

On Letters  

By Ina Amdur
Dear Freshmen:

At sometime in /your college career, you will
probably ask yourself the question, “What am I
doing in college?” After the furor of the ﬁrst
weeks has died, and some of the tedium has, begun,
this question will hopefully arise
in your mind. V

Sometimes sensitive poets, if
this is not redundant, can cap-
ture in a few simple lines, what
advisors, professors, and other
lesser mortals can realize un-
consciously and yet cannot ar-
ticulate. One poet unintention-
ally answered our question.
Emily.Dickinson, with her char-
acteristic acuity, once wrote a
poem beginning with these two
lines: I

This is my. letter to the world
Which never wrote to me.

These are simple, almost child-like lines which
might well be inscribed over every door of every
university in the country. For this business of
goingto college, in its ideal state, consists of the
reading of posthumous letters written to the world.
And what we sometimes forget is that the letter
is a form of communication between, two people.
The great novels, poems, symphonies, and paint-
ings, are only the carefully thought-out letters of
a handful of people addressed only to those who
want to open "them.

Magic Sadness

Art is the attempt to communicate something,
some sound, some emotion or some insight. The
magic and‘ the sadness of it all is that the insights
are frozen in canvas, in print, or on record, while
the human being who fathered the object of com-
munication has long since bowed, as everyone
must, to the demands of mortality. The product
of his loneliness, his attempt to cominunicate with
the world that never wrote to him. his attempt to
bring order to chaos, lives on to make others less
lonely than he was. One cannot propose that all
art is the lack of the artist’s-inability to communi-
cate with the "people around him. One can only

 

 

 

“girl-next-door.” University ﬂirts thrive on mak-
ing nuisances of themselves and are particularly
fond of disrupting Pitt News offices on deadline
days. I
Rhino Not Fino

Then there are the "‘rhinos." Thick gobs of
runny make-up, bulky clothing over an already
bulky frame, bare feet or sandals personify this

clique. At least rhinos could paint all their toes

the same color.

Finally there is the “A—OK” category: an All-,0
tAmerican blessing to any campus.

An “A-OK”
physically resembles Miss America, aware of the
ﬁnancial limitations of the male col1egiate’s pocket-
book, afriend, not ‘an opponent likg. Li‘l Abner’s
Daisy Mac or the university ﬂirts. '

 
  

Judging by the appearance of freshman and

sophomore co-eds, the old adage that “99 per cent

of the girls in Pittsburgh are beautiful; the other;
one per cent goes to Pitt” coud be amending itself.

Missing Misses _ .

With sweeping curriculum revisions being in-
augurated by the University, prospective co-eds
are ﬁnding “Husband-‘Hunting 92,” “Tuck Shop
Fraternization 104,” and other such courses missing
from the time schedules and are staying away. The
admissiones ofﬁce must also be given credit for
their recently ﬁne co~ed selections (I’m only
kidding, gentlemen). _ , »

One factor favoring the university-level hus-_
band-hunters is registration. How romantic —-
meeting “the great dreamy one” while standing
in line for nine hours on the 18th ﬂoor. If nothing
else, that confusion must do »a great deal of match-
making. ‘ g '

So, fellow bachelors, until there are enough
“A-—OK’s” for everyone: rest in peace - at least
temporarily.

Ladies, if you are now thoroughly infuriated
and insulted, if your lawyer ‘is on the phone, and
if a law suit is on the way please stop at once.

It’s said that we really can’t do without you.
But I’m tryinv.

desire to escape from solitude and to speak to those
who are willing to listen.

Noble Attempt ‘
The attempt of every artist is a noble one, be.

cause in some»-sense it is doomed from the be-

ginning. His l.etter can be forgotten, his letter
can be misconstrued, his letter can be lost, or worst
of all his letter can be ridiculed. But “he takes the
chance —— he forgets the human image, he tries to
pluck Out the mystery, and he sends his answer
to the world, come what may.

Whahstudents and their professors so often for-‘

get is that the author of the letter once “lived.

Keats €0t up in the m0YDin§. loved, suffered,

laughed, and died, He shared in the
human experiences of human beings. And when
he wrote letters like “Ode to a Nightingale?’ he
wished to remind. us that he once heard a nightin-
gale whose immortal song was so beautiful, whose

world was so foreign to the one that Keats knew,

it-Uovthe one that we know; that he fell in -love while
tstening to it. He could very easily have written
of this experience to a close friend in a letter, just
as we write letters to others describing expe,.i_
ences which have been meaningful to us,
Tomb Watchers ,

In our society the professiofial academicians and
the students are the appointed, though not always

the responsible. caretakers of the tombs of the

artists. They resurrect‘ them more frequently than
others. If one could forget‘ the cliches on the
matlchbook covers for a moment, perhaps‘ then (me
coud say that one is going to college to serve a.
four year term the object of which is to wage
battle with mortality, not one’s own but someone
else’s. If one is lucky, the four year term can be
expanded to a life sentence. "

S. G. Book
Exchange

Successful

Volume Doubles

Summer Totals

By MATT SWETONIC

The student book exchange, lo-
cated in the checkroom of the
Student Union, made its serv-
ices available to more students
thisyear than ever before.

The checkroom was described
as an ideal location because of the
heavy ﬂow of student traffic pass-
ing by each day going in and out
of the cafeteria. ,

More than 1000 students made
use of the exchange’s facilities for
buying and selling books. Jay
Fingeret, head of the exchange,
reported that 668 books were han-
dled by his organization this tri-
mester. This is double the volume
of business transacted last term.

Exchange Increased

More than $2100 passed through
the exchange this year and exact
ﬁgures, available sometime next
week, should show net gain of
almost $150. The money will be
placed into the Student Govern-
mtn budget to offset the losses
caused by business failures among
their activities.

"Students who were unable to
pick up either their money or un-
sold books yesterday may do so at
the Book Exchange ofﬁce in room
325 of the Student Union. Oﬁice

hours may be had by inquiring at

the Student Union desk.

Any books not claimed by
students before Friday will be
held until next trimester.

There have been some com-
plaints from students that the
prices which they paid for books
bought through the exchange were
higher than those charged by the
book store. This was not an in-
tentional attempt on the part of
the exchange to cheat the students
according to Fingeret.

The prices on the new books
were not available to the sellers
working in the checkroom and
therefore, in a number of cases,
the prices charged the students
were too high. The price list put
out by the book store was not
compiled in time to be of use to
SG, ,which has no control over
prices itself.

 

SERVICE AREA

The Student Union has ex-
panded its Student Service area
in response to increasing needs
of campus groups for supplying
students with information. They
will supply printed posters, in-
formal signs, letters, and post-
cards, at cost.

Samples and information will
be available at the Student Un-
ion Desk.

 

Eas Livin’

 

ALMOST TWO WEEKS of school have elapsed and students still act
as if it were spring. Perhaps they should live it up while the weather
is nice and there is no slushy snow on the ground; yet, the tri-
mesters go awfully fast. It really is time to hit those books.

 

 

Homecoming Plans Shaping

For November 18 Weekend

Plans for this year’s annual
Homecoming activities are still in
the tentative stage, according to
John Newell, chairman of the ev-
ent.

Slated for the weekend of the
Southern California football game,
the Homecoming dance will be
held November 18.

In its attempt to make Home-
coming campuswide, SG suggest-
ed that the dorms as well as In-
terfraternity Council and Pan-
Hellenic Council participate in the
float and house front competition.

In the past fraternities and so-
rorities were the chief contribu-
tors to the three day activities. No
definite plan to incorporate more
University activities was decided
upon at the committee's meeting
last week.

Positions‘ on the various com-
mittees can be obtained in the
Dean of Men’s Office on the 8th
floor, C1.

Committee chairmen have been
appointed. Accepting the respon-
sibility as business manager was
Bob Erlich. The executive secre-
tary position has been ﬁlled by
Mary Alice Polyak while Fyrne
Pearlstein will serve as publicity
manager. Chairman of the general

House From: committee will be

Bob Slotkin.

Students Urged to Eat
At Less Crowded Times

Saga Food Service has recently
announced that students using the
Schenley Cafeteria should, if _at
all possible, try to avoid eating
during peak periods of service at
the noon hour and from 5 p.m. to
6 p.m. at dinner.

When possible students are
urged to eat during less congested
hours.

Saga has introduced several
new facilities this term: machines
dispensing Pepsi—Cola and orange
soda, and high ﬁdelity music will
be piped into the eating areas
from WRYT-FM and WWSW
radio station.

advantages in their new office. 1.
The Cubicles will provide more
privacy for student and advisor.
2. The -new office will have added

assistance with increased office "

personnel 3. Since the Board will
handle only Liberal Arts stu-
dents, the Cathedral office will
be more accessible to the students
involved. 4. The full—time advisors
will be able to devote more time
to the problems of the individual
student. A

an According to Anthony Athens,

many of the questions commonly
asked by students may be an-
swered by reading the student
handbook, which is available in

1028 D Cl.

Mr. Athens also mentioned that
it is of prime importance to the
students that they keep in con-
tact with their advisors through-

out the~school year. Because each.

advisor has so many students to
assist, he can not check everyone’s
progress and he must be kept
aware of the current conditions by
the studentsthemselves. I

VlKING MIGRATION SOUTHWARD

Peering precariously from the pinnacle of the Cathe-
dral of Learning, past the roofs of Mellon Institute and the
Fairfax‘-Hotel, one can see a black skeletal tower or weather-
vane that stands atop Central District Catholic High School.

Within this brick ediﬁce, the Christian;Broth.ers, famous
for their California wines, instruct cherubs in the ﬁne arts
of Latin, theology and football. Their prodigie-s-——-1,300 in
number—have all been siphoned from Pittsburgh area grade
schools, with a close eye to their scholarship and size.

These parochial contributors, incidentally, all boast of
miniature-size football teams whichcompete in a vast, well-
populated league. Central gets the shrimps for science and
the monolithic variety for Friday night ﬁsticuifs.

Our interest in reporting
on the football frivolities of
Central High is because Mi-
ami, obviously, has an un-
derground railroa_d between
here and their Biscayne Bay
campus, by which they transport the ‘rare’ ones, ‘called Vik-
ings by name. The intellectually-inclined Norsemen go to
South Bend, ﬁrst, Pitt, second.

Some of Miami’s footballers hail from Childersburg, Al-
abama; Agawam, Massachusetts, and Palatine. Illinois, but .
eighteen of their staffers are boys from Penn’s woods, west,
east, north, south.

A half-dozen of these were plucked right off the Pitt
campus in the hamlets of Pittsburgh (Oops! There I go
letting out Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s plans for expansion).

Of these (the fractions are getting me down) four have
squeezed through the hands of the Christian Brothers. Cen-
tral Catholic claims only three ofﬁcially, however, for one
of the quartet, fouled up on the Latin and theology seg-
ments of the school program.

ter position. At the left-tackle slot, Stan Maluty holds forth.

All V’il_;ings, at one time or another. O’Mahony, a toughie
from Oakland, devoured Pitt runners last [year at the
Stadium. This irked the Panther coaches to no end _since
O’Mahony was pledged here originally. He skipped out on
Pitt on the day before school opened, preferring the balmy
breezes of Cape Coral.

A fourth-string guard, Dennis McGroarty, matriculated
from South Hills Catholic in Pittsburgh. A few others trav-
eled from Natrona Heights, Coraopolis, Bovard, Allentown,
and Philadelphia. Oh, and they have a fella named Bill Mil-
ler from McKeesport who is tabbed for All-American End.

l\/IcKeesport’s too far, so if we should lose, perish the
thought, fanatic Panther boosters should climb all 34 ﬂights
of stairs, and hurl grenades at Central Catholic High School.

Backfield Iniuries
Foil Hurricanes

By WILBERT BACH
Miami Publicity Director

CORAL GABLES, F1orida——When the University of‘Pittsb,urgh’s
Panthers roar out onto the turf of the Orange Bowl in Miami the after-

, noon of September 16, they’ll smash head-on into the University of

Miami football team which is doing considerable hedging from early

 predictions of greatness.

The Hurricanes had their share of “ifs” with which to cope as

 they looked through rose-colored glasses at thei.r 1961 prospects,

ut now they are wondering whether they will be able to see clay-
light. at all in their heavy schedule.
. A sharp change.in plans and prospects has followed the re-
‘injury of Eddie "Johns" knee,‘ an injury which will sideline the
Bovard, Pa. junior at least until mid—season, possibly for the whole
campaign. _
A year ago, as a sophomore quarterback, Johns had passed for

 657 yards and ran for 521 more, highest total offense for any Miam.i
j sophomore in history and second highesttotal ever.

With a couple of capable ‘sophomore quarterbacks-—-George Mira

 of Key West, Fla. and John Benn_ett of Clifton’ Heights, Pa. coming
, up for this fall, the Miami coaching staff «elected to shift Johns
I to left halfback to take better advantage

V of his great running ability
‘and also to add diversity to the p f I — I 1
Miami oﬁense by adding halfback

  
 

‘4 As a result of Johns’ injury,
of the offense the Hurri-
canes had planned to use this
fall _has been scrapped. Nick
Ryder, a right ‘halfback of note
‘last season, has had. to take over

I/sz:l:O--*

sophomore from Coraopolis, Pa.
and John Bahen, a junior from
Frostburg, Md., who saw little

defense, are doing the right halfbackingu --
Miami’ coaches believe the new backﬁeld will jell in time, but
V they just have not‘ had enough time to get it working smoothly for
the early opener. They will ‘have to go" into an important opener
with a bare two weeks of practice against a toe which had a nine-
‘day jump. in starting pre-season training. ' g

M They will be depending upon sophomores in half the four back-
1 Yield slots. In the two remaining positions, veterans will be making
their debuts.’ Nick Ryder, a right halfback in 1960, is now at left

 

 halfback, and Jim Vollenweider, left halfback last year, is now the
 fullback. There isn’t much depth in the backﬁeld.

Up front, the team lost a center and its two top tackles from

 1960 along with Jack Novak, top guard,‘ who started against Pitt last
~; year. Miami’s defense was not very potent a year ago and with

virtually the same cast back, it
is hard to see where much im-

 

provement can be expected.

Three sophomores may give

the line a boost. All of them are
now on the second shift, and
after a few games may move up.
Leo Lillimagi, 212 pound center
from Highland, N.Y.; Daniel
Conners, 225-pound tackle from
St. Marys, Pa. and Joe Smerdel,
215-pound tackle from Pittsburgh
are promising rookies.
_   The strength of the return-
ing line lies in its ends with Bill Miller, who made Look All-America,
as the top man. He is a brilliant pass-receiver and is helping young
George Mira gain the poise heineeds to click at quarterback.

Stan Maluty, a senior who has not lettered, will open at one
tackle, and Bob Dentel, a junior letter-man, will start at center. Both
are Pittsburghers. Miller is from McKeesport. Jim. O’Mahony, an-
other Pittsburgher, is guard on the second-unit.

Because of the wholesale shifts in the backﬁeld, Miami is ex-
pecting to get off to a slow start this year, but is counting on be-

 

ginning to click by mid-season had the Pitt game remained. where it

was originally scheduled--December 9-Miami would have been
ready for whatever the Panthers could offer, but the September 16
opener comes just too soon for the revamped Miami backﬁeld to jell.

H is Buddy Agrees
That Pitt’s Tough

The little round fellow
ambled, through the singed
grass, straw—like strands lac-
ing his bare feet. A typical
country bumpkin, one would
surmise. This wasno hayseed
character, however. He was on his
way to chow, just as hungry as a
boy who had toiled in the ﬁelds
all day. -

His appetite had been whetted
by his initial working day on the
ﬁelds of Allegheny College in
Meadville, Pennsylvania, The
husky fellow with the bucolic grin
was Larry Vignali, Pitt’s No. 1
guard. . ‘

Moments later. seated at a near-
empty table in the Allegheny
College cafeteria, nibbling on
some salad now, Vignali paused
from his meal to express his an-
xiety about the upcoming season.

“I feelthat we’ll have a good

year despite what the cynics have

been saying,” Vignali remarked.
“As for myself. I feel real good
and I am confident that I’ll have
a good year.” A

Injuries Hurt Rating

“That is barring all injuries,”
he added with foresight. In 1960,
Larry separated his shoulder in
the first quarter of the season
opener with UCLA. Before. the
TCU game he was ‘hospitalized
for five days because of an in-
fection. After the finale against
Penn State, the chunky guard was
hobbled for four weeks with his
leg in a cast.

Theseinjuries prevented Vig-
nali from gaining the glory that
was his. He was picked on many
pre-season All-America. teams
last year. ‘Only Stanley Wood-
lward, who does research before
writing, has stuck by his side
this year. ‘

When informed that Nick Sko-
rich of the pro-champion Phila-
delphia Eagles of the NFL had
expressed interest in him, Vignali
said, “I’d like to give it a try.”
He glanced at his buddy, Rege
Coustillac, who mans the other
first-string guard position, for ap-
proval. Coustillac just grinned im-
pishly.

Would Make Good Pro

Some connoisseurs of the pay»,
for-play circuit have stated that
“with his ﬁre-plug build and
ﬁghting savvy,” that he’d make a
fine pro guard. The Pittsburgh
Steelers won’t draft him, how-
ever, for he has been hurt in the
past.

They’ll ﬁgure that he’s injury-
prone like former Panther Joe
Schmidt, now of the Lions, was.
And Lenny Moore of Penn State.
now with the Colts, was another
collegiate thought to be too brit- ‘

tie for the rough pro contact
work.

“We’ll have the usual rough
schedule,” Vignali said, “but I like
it that way. At least some day I .
can say that I played against
such and such a school, and this
All-American and that one. I
won’t have to tell someone that I
played against Fluke University.
Right, Rege?” /J

“Yeh,” Coustillac smiled, “but
that quote ought to make you real
popular with your small.-college
friends.”

“I still think we’ll be better
than last year,” Vignali said em-

Pitt Field House. He and his wife, 
Carole, live in Robinson Court in

Terrace Village, the red-bricked‘ T 
project plan behind the Pitt ath- >
letic fields. 

“I have a boy who’ll be seven
months old on September 7,”
Larry said, glowingly. “If he’s
real good, he’ll play for Pitt, but
I won’t put him on the spot.”
His baby boy may never know
it, but his rugged ol’ man still
cries. Last year before the Syra-
cuse game, Larry’s eyes were
streaming with tears, he was so
worked up over the game. Pitt
went on to dump the heralded
Orange, 10-0, in a major upset.
- Pitt backers are hoping that the
Miami game will be a real tear-
jerker, a pre-game sob that is. The
interview culminated. Vign ali
went back ‘to munching on his
salad. He’s on a diet. Right,
Rege?—--0’BRIEN. '
