Campus Parties

Twenty—ﬁve students turned out at last Tuesday’s meet-
ing‘ to organize a Young Democrats chapter on the Uni-

versity campus. Although they may not realize it, they

have formed the nucleus for a constructive, thinking body
o_f students concerned with United States domestic affairs
and foreign policy. _ ’ C
We hope that eventually a Young Republicans group
will soon be organized to meet the demands of a two-party
system on this campus. Yes, eventually we may ﬁnd other
interested groups on campus; NAACP, for example.
Presently, the political organizations will concern them-

‘ selves with the Presidential election, but on off-years they

may just as vehemently promote those planks and programs
which the professional parties do throughout the country.
In a practical sense, it is this ability to evaluate the coun-
try’s station within itself and in the world that the parties
will promote among students.  " 

" Wisely, the Democratic group has formed,-as a party
organization, although within it may be special interest

_groups supporting individual Presidential candidates. This

basic stability will assure it not being-a “ﬂash in the pan,_”
but rather a permanent inﬂuentialbody‘ at Pitt. So should
the other groups form. ' -

We look forward to seeing both parties established in
oﬁices in ‘this University, soon, and located permanently in
the Student Union, next year. ’

Re traction_ 

When the editorincluded the parking pool story in last

'l\‘/londay’s paper, he- erroneously stated both in the article

and’i”n the headline that the project was sponsored by Stu-
dent Congress. It is a Men’s-Council program._ -
Aside from blaming him for poor journalism, .we must

chastize him for using simple‘ logic. Without checking,‘ he
unconsciously imagined thatan all—school parking‘ pool was i

being conducted by SC. _ .
Even ~freshmen realize that all student government

‘I groups overlap in- responsibility. Men’s Council, despite‘
that\1t 1S designated only for men’s'activity, will sponsor

any project to which it may lay‘ claim. Struggle for sur-

_. By IRV ROTHMAN

Seldom do personalities we interview for fea-
ture stories return to chat with the staff; but when
they do, the stories they bring with them are
often more interesting than those we printed?

World—trave1er English teacher Mrs. Beatrice
Freedman, whom we interviewed in January, stop-
ped in to tell about some ‘little-knov’ facts of
Pittsburgh.. She‘ recently had ‘
.completed a’ student teaching
course at a local high school to
get her state certiﬁcate, although
she had taught English to for- :
eign students for many years.

One of Mrs. Freedman’s prié
mary interests has been theater.
She was dismayed to ﬁnd at ‘
her assigned high ‘school an un-
usually well—equipped stage that_ y ?
had not been used for theatrical productions in

 

Y » almost ﬁve years. She asked why. Being a trained

professional she was certainly more prepared for
the ensuing experience than we were to hear about
it. . ' . '
There was clear-cut opposition from the school
administration because of fear of racial conﬂicts—
even in northern Pittsburgh..

Because theschool population had grown to in-
clude approximately 50 per cent negroes; the prin-
cipal quietly stopped stage productions for fear
that the eventual mixing of play characters would

One thing was proven at the
recent Inter—F»raternity Council
elections-fraternity men at Pitt
aren’t always men —- they gave
the impression that they’re just
boys. ”

T h e y childlessly permitted
.cheap political chicanery and
stubborn plartisan voting to de-
prive them of the chanceto elect
the most vlogicalcandidates for
the IF offices. , - ' :

Before going any further, i-t
should be stated that this writer
feels each of the newly—elected

officers is capable and serious
and should be able to provide IF
with "competent; ‘ careful lead-

in ers_h_ip.

Deserving Candidates‘: ,.
Nevertheless, . Larry Miller,
an"d Bob M_cCabe, members of the
Panther Party, deserved to have
been elected officers on the basis
of their experience in Council
and its Executive Committee.
The fact that Miller. attended
the National Interfraternity
Council convention in .‘Sl2. Louis
last year cannot be overlooked;

he may not'have yet taken it to heart.’ An
“It’s a way to solve a naughty problem the jpagi
way.” Mrs. -Freedmanstated that day ‘she,

to us.

A

be absorbed ideas there which
"he could have channeled into
practice at Pitt. .
Bob McCabe, a member of the
All—'Pit_t, is the 1956 “S” Awar-
dee, and that single fact should
have been enough recommenda-
tion for his sitting on the IF Ex-
ecutive Committee. 
, I Both of these fellows weren’t
elected because Pitt’s fraternity
men have made no effort to re-
concile ‘the petty differences
which have split them into two
factions. This is pathetic, be-
cause the fraternities will soon
have to face a powerful new
political foe—the independents.
New University Power
University officials tell us that
the newly-acquired‘ Schenley‘
.Apartments will at least be par-,
tially occupied by September of
1957. We can ,assume that a
large percentage of "these occu-
pants will be non-Greeks, and
they won’t be apathetic toward
student affairs, because ‘they
.won’t have to spend so much
of their time commuting.
They will be in a‘ position to
change the current situation in

| Letters to
Resolution '

.Editor, The Pitt News
The ideas expounded by Mr.
Kirsch in his article last week
will not‘ bring about advance-
ment of race relations. Nobody
can disagree with the author
that it is high time for the Negro
to throw off the mantle of sec-
ond—class citizenship. But let’s
' consider what will happen if the
Monroe _ Resolution is passed.
Does anyonejthink the South will
accept this -meekly?. More than
likely there will be more White
Citizens’ ,(_;ounci1s' formed, more
Klanism-, " and more _ violence.
Radical measures breed radical

measures. ‘ ~

'-Moderation has already.

brought »a great deal of progress.
The victory of principle already
belongs to the Negro. It is only
a matter of time until the prin-
'ciple' governs completely in the
South. . ’ ‘  ' ' ‘

Seventeen states in the recent»

past. barred ‘Negroes _from"co1-
leges but only ﬁve still‘ do‘ so.
The younger element, as illus-

 

th Ed ‘tor 
trated by the actions of the
Georgia Tech student body, are

rejecting segregation. '
The eventual integration‘ of the
Negro in the South is inevitable.
A recent Gallup Poll shows that
8 out‘ of 10 white Southerners
oppose integration but the ma-
jority feel ‘it will eventually
come. This integration will not
come because of extreme .meas-'
ures of either side( but will come
when the South acepts the Negro
as a person rather than a cipher

. bearing ‘a ’ writ’ of ‘mandamus.

. Dear Mr. Bloom:
Most simply, the Monroe Res-

actors were guilty of was the

the fact that the number of states

Ours is a government of pres-

sure by writing to their repre-
sentatives on the State Legisla-
ture, letting them know their
feelings on the Monroe Resolu-

on the Federal Government to

Returned After

Since last Monday, March 13,
Vice Chancellor Nutting’s book-

casecontaining his law books, a‘

telephone directory and other re-
ferences, was stolen and returned.

Although Dr. Nutting’s secre'- _

doesn’t need the books in the
stolen case right away,” Miss
Young also stated that Dr. Nut-

_ ting advised her to call Buildings

and Grounds-Department to dis-
cover the whereabouts of the

The Vice Chancellor asked his

Harper and the Phi Gams, who

Watson was referring to the re-

Panther Party and was expected
to be elected -president. Harper
received the support of the All-

ed that Harper was “the best man”
for the presidency.

Dissension Created

Most of the Panthers think that
the All-Pitts ‘backed Harper in an
attempt to create dissension in the
Panther ranks. ' I
, Harper attended a , recent

Panther Party meeting, Watson
said and “Tried to justify what
he had done by saying that
since Larry Miller -was‘ a Pan-

“He just couldn’t’ seem to see,”
Watson continued, ‘.‘that he had

Given SC Members

By SHELLY WEISS \

Harbaugh Miller, member of the Board of Trustees and
an alumnus of the University of Pittsburgh, was guest speak-
er at the Student Congress meeting, last Monday afternoon.

In his introductoryremarks Miller explained the struc-
ture of the board as being comprised of 32 members-—t_en
alumnae, 20 civic, professional and industrial community

- leaders, the ‘mayor of Pittsburgh and the chancellor of the

,University. The
ing board” members are elected
for three year terms. A

Functioning committees" of the
board include buildings and prop-
erty, faculty and curriculum, hon-
orary degrees, athletics, nominat-
ing the trustees, and the Medical
Center

_, Miller these committees have been
“far more active in recent years.”

New Outlook Taken '

A new outlook has been taken
on the concept of a “University
to serve the community” and care-
ful consideration is being given ‘to

the possible implication that this
may mean quality of students
rather than quantity.
Following the trustee’s brief
explanation ‘of the board, SC
members presented questions to

» him:

.What are your views and that
of the board’s concerning Dr.
Litchﬁeld’s statement of “Pitt as
an organic part of the commu-
nity” and yet a university of qual-
ity? ~

Answer: “It is not a matter of
dissatisfaction with what has been
done, but we are going to be a
quality University. It will take
time. We are going to try to meet
the needs of this community in the
best way we know how . . . by
producing the leadership in the
community it hasn’t had before.”

Saturday, March 10," only to leave
without making a single arrest.

Dithridge St. which’ featured
roulette wheels, dice tables and
card games. All this action took
place behind a specially construct-

‘ ed peep-hole door. The only dif-

ference between the fraternity af-
fair and a genuine casino was that
the large stacks of gambling chips
scattered around the rooms were
nbt redeemable for cash. _

Late in the evening, Oakland

call complaint about the suspicious
behavior in and -around the fra-
ternity house. 5
Rushing to the scene in prowl
cars, the police were prepared to
handle a full-scale gambling raid.
They stormed the house and found

ing a shady character who called
himself Nathan Detroit. Shouts of
“raid, raid!” were heard from the
street. ‘ »

After the investigation the po-
lice were convinced that the
“gamblers” were operating within
the law.  ‘

ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: No.3:

Today, ranging again into the fascinating world _
science,.let us take up the subject of anthropology — the study
of man and his origins. _ p _

The origin of man was indeed a vexing question until the
Frenchman, J ean-Louis Sigafoos, discovered the skull and shin"-é
bone of Pithecanthropus Erectus in Java in 1891. ‘(What Sig
foos was doing in J ava~is, incidentally, quite an odd little stor ,_
Sigafoos was a Parisian born and bred. By day one could always’,

_ find him at a boulevard cafe, sipping Biére de Racine and_ ogl.ing'_
the girls; each night he went to a fashionable casino where he
gambled heavily at roulette and jacks; in between timesfhe‘
worked on his stamp collection. ‘ ' ' ' 

 

Stud/I l<l_7l1’I77..'7'/zlc1v3.<z'/Z. . I ‘   

C.‘

. (Well sir, one summer Sigafoos lost his entire fortune gam-
. , bling at the casino, and he was seriously contemplating suicide
when a ray of hope appeared in an unexpected quarter.’ It seems
that,Sigaf,oos, through the international stamp collectors j.ou1f.-
nal, hadlong been in correspondence -with a girl in Java,.‘a}
mission-educated savage named Lotus ‘Petal McGinnis, herself
an enthusiastic stamp collector. -The nature of their correspond-
ence, though friendly,‘ had been entirely philatelic. Now, sud-
denly, a new kind of letter came from Lotus Petal. She declared 
that although she had _never laid eyes on Sigafoos, she loved
him and wanted to marry him. She said she was eighteenvyears
old, beautiful, and her father, the richest man in his tribe, would
givehalf his fortune to the husband of her choice. Sigafoos‘,
in his reduced circumstances, had no alternative; he- sold his
last few belongings and booked passage for Java. *
.(The ﬁrst sight of his prospective bride failed to delight
Sigafoos. She was, as she said, beau-tiful—but only by local
standards. Sigafoos had serious doubts that her bright red
pointed teeth and the chicken bones hanging from her earlobess
would be considered chic along the Champs Elysées. .. _ _
(But.sobering as was the sight of Lotus Petal, Sigafoos had
an even greater disappointment coming when he met her father."
The old ‘gentleman was, as Lotus Petal had represented, the
richest man in his tribe, but, unfortunately, the medium of ex-'
change in his tribe was prune pits. "
(Sigafoos took one look at the mound ‘of’ prune pits, which
was his dowry, gnashed his teeth, and stomped off intotthe
jungle, swearing vilely and kicking at sticks and stones and
-whatever else lay- in his path. Stomping thus, swearing thus,‘
kicking thus, Sigafoos kicked over a heap of old bones which..-,
what do you know! —turned out to be the skull and shin of.
Pithecanthropus Erectus.) . I '  . 2

But I digress... From the brutish Pithecanthropus, "man
evolved slowly upward, growing more intelligent and resource-
ful, By“ the Middle Paleolithic-period man had invented the
leash, which ,_ was _a remarkable technical achievement, but:

Michelosen Opens
Spring Grid Drills
This Afternoon

In the spring the sportsman’s
thoughts turn to baseball, but not
those of John Michelosen and. his
football squad.

This afternoon the squad will
start ﬁlling the air at Ellsworth
Center with footballs as they be-
gin spring training for the 1956
campaign.

Back to try their skills for an-
other season are. 29 lettermen, a
raft of hopefuls up from the fresh-
man squad, and any other eligible
male students who may ‘desire to
play the game.

Coach Michelosen lost seven of
his starring team but only 12 from
the entire squad, which capped
the successful 1955 season with a
trip to the Sugar.Bowl..

“Michelson feels that live play-
ers, Corny Salvaterra, Tom J euk-
ins, Dick Bowen, Corky Cost, and
Ralph Jelic, who rotated with the
graduated members of the team,
are capable of ‘ﬁlling the vacant
positions. ‘

The coach said he will stress
conditioning and stamina as the
basis of the team. At 4 p.m~. this
afternoon, this conditioning, which

Young Democrats
Pledge Support

In keeping with the coming presidential race, Pitt .stu-
dents have petitioned and are organizing Young -Democrat
and Young Republican clubs. _

Bob Sedler, student conAgress president and organizer

of the Young Democrats, stated
that the Young Democrats will

generally support the Democratic
Party. This club will not actively
back any speciﬁc Democratic
candidate, but will support the
candidate who wins the Demo-
cratic n_omination'th'is year; i
Sedler announced that this -or-

 development of anew airplane such as the Crusader, the World’s Fastest
in Navy Fighter, cannot be credited to any on’e engineer. Each -engineer, how-
ever, is invaluable because _this truly new high-performance airplane is only the

‘ﬁnal resnlt of the creative thought and teamwork of a large number of engineers.

\ .

The individual ideas of each engineer are most

important. In aircraft design, -the time lag between
discovery and the utilization of knowledge is
extremely short, shorter perhaps than in any other
major industry. The solutions to the most stimu-
lating problems which arise in the. industry are

frequently dependent upon the daily utilization of

new ideas and new knowledge.

The graduating engineer considering his ﬁrst
career decision may choose whether he will enter
this ﬁeld of» work—-the design of airplanes and

missiles —-' that progresses hand in hand with new '

discoveries in all facets of science and engineering,
or choose a less aggressive industry. Of course, it

follows logically’ that greater and more rapid ad- A

vancement opportunities_ lie in a ﬁeld that does not
stagnate, in a ﬁeld that is bounded by the creative
imagination of man alone. At'Chance Vought, air-
craft design draws capable engineers to positions
of greater responsibility in developing new ideas
and supervising the additional technical manpower

- needed to “practicalize’-’ the ideas. Starting sala-

ries are commensurate with education and ‘expe-

rience for particular specialization and are also

competitive with other industries as well as
other companies. Advancement, as one would

expect, is based upon demonstrated performance,
not seniority. T

The future of the aircraft industry is equal to, if ,. \.
not brighter than, that of other industries. The
complexity" of modern aircraftandimissiles, the t ._—-l._}
investigation of new ﬁelds of knowledge as air-

man’s further use of science and engineering’ for» ’
conquest of the air in the second half of the 20th ‘

century, all emphasize the challenge and oppor-

tunity to the young graduate.

We urge the graduating engineer to investigate -
these opportunities at Chance Vought’. He will ’
ﬁnd a stable, 38-year-old aircraft designer and
builder with young ideas, adesigner and builder

‘craft and guided missile design. He will discover , ’  j   /"M
that Chance Vought offers career opportunities,
not merely impressive, titles, and that he will
join an engineering organization that thinks
and operates" as alteam rather than as a random
collection of individual engineers. A
