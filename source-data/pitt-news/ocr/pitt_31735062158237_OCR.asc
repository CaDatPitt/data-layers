U1 s Indefinite

One of last yearis student
political parties has revealed
that it will reorganize for this
year’s election, but the other
is doubtful that it will do the

same.

Chris Gillotti, chairman -of the
Allied Collegiate party, said that
his group has scheduled a meet-
ing for tomorrow evening to
make plans forthis year’s party.
The meeting will begin at 8 p.m.
in Apt. 4D, Belleﬁeld Dwellings.
- The unlikely participant in “the
campaign is the United Indepen-
dent party. Spokesman Richard
Mattern said that he. has been
unable to ﬁnd anyone who wants
to run for the government‘ posi-
tions. ‘

“In light of-the few outstand-
ing candidates from the present
SGA who are willing to run-for
another term, there is little rea-
son to reorganize, any party,”
Mattern stated. “If the present
members_ will not support SGA,
what hope is there to attract
new students?’

Mattern‘ did, however, leave
the way open-for a reformation
of the U15. “If there are students
who are willing to run on an
United Independent slate, our
central committee will be more
than happy to organize, such stu-
dents for a winning ticket.”

Gillotti, on the other hand, was
deﬁnite in his ideas about this
year’s AC party. “The Allied
Collegiate’ party realizes‘ that in
the pa-stit has been dominated

Parties Reactivate  
As Elections Near;

One Man for Prexy
‘ A , By MURRAY CI-[ASS ‘ I ’

With the announcement on Monday that party and in-
dividual petitions for March 18’s student election ‘are availa-
ble, political aspirants got busy. The resultstof the ﬁrst two
‘days show that there is one candidate for the presidency- of
Student Government Association and that the two political
parties are beginning to stir——one in a positive manner, the
other in a rather iuisure fashion. I

J. Kent J arrell, treasurer of
Student Government Associa-
tion, has announced that he
isa candidate for president of

SGA. Jarrell thus becomes __

the ﬁrst entrant in the race

which will be decided on March
18 in a school-wide election.

In announcing his candidacy,
Jarrell said that he will not affi-
liate nwith any of the political
parties which existed last year.
“I have talked with members of
both of the parties about by af-
ﬁliation with ‘them, and I feel that
under their present means. of
slating and their policies, Icah-
not join with them,” he said.’

“Unless this situation changes,
I feel I must ask individual
members of the student body
,'for_ their support.” The presi-
dential candidate said that he
is‘ interested in running with
“competent” people, “no matter
what their fraternity or inde-
pendent status may be.”

Jarrell further stated that he
would like anyone who is inter-
ested in running for any office or
in “working for better student
government” to contact him.

Last year» Jarrell was » an un-
successful candidate for a junior
class position on the Allied Col-
lcgiate party ticket. He .event-
ually was appointed to the posi-
tion after- two of the electedire-
presentatives resigned. In

Working Students ' Finance  

One of the basic problems confronting many students is
that of ﬁnance. Several hunclred are working for the _Uni- ‘
versity in various capacities, not for “kicks” but for f00d~ consistency. Other smaller ones, stood - in glass

and necessities.

These students now are paid once a month t
Often the actual date-itof payment is not on the ﬁrst of the
-month, but the ﬁfth or sixth. So a student may be without

payfor even longer than. a full month.

We submit that student ‘employees should be paid every

heoretically.

two weeks, even if this causes some inconvenience in the

payroll office. It is difficult for a student with gnawing any ‘repeated
I ﬁnancial worries to do his best work in school. I

This is a pressing problem and one that demands the
immediate attention of those in charge of payroll distribu-

tion. It may not be necessary for a professor to have a pay-
check more oftentha-n once a month, although at times this

too is doubtful, but it is imperative that a student eat.

Many large corporations pay once every two weeks (or

-even once a week) and there is. no good reason that the
University cannot pay its student employees on this basis.

To do so would be a humanitarian gesture,

Students are an uncomplaining lot in general. Some-
times one gets the impression that they just don’t care
about very much. But this is one subject which has many
of them hollering and thus far no one has responded.

The student body is an important segment of any Uni‘-
versity and to make a large number of students more con-
tent, the payroll heads should be willing to make adjust-

ments. »

\

Apatlzyrlrises gain)

The election campaign grows near once more and this
year one problem overshadows all others. Anunwillingness
on the part of many of. the best potential candidates to run
creates a situation in which some may step in unopposed.

It is never a healthy situation‘ to have only one person
for whom to vote for major positions in Student Govern-
ment. The ositions -might lose their values even_to the good
-candidates running.’ for oﬁice, if they must do nothing to

' achieve them.

Again, a clear case of apathy in the student body. Few

regard student governmenteas more importantthan other -

commitments activity-wise at the University.

r Under the new constitution as under previous ones, stu-

it is necessary that they do.

   

' dents fail to feel that student government is important.
There is still time for some of the hold—out candidates to
cha.nge their minds. For a ﬂourishing government ‘next year, I

By David Breaks!-one"'

- .Every.evening just before the curfew, the mu-
seum guards shufﬂed through the» exhibition rooms
quietly ‘announcing, “The” show is closing,\please.”
So it was ‘last Sunday when, except for a little
more cgaxing, the_ crowd mus-
ingly tramped out of the gallery
for the last ‘time. The gigantic
1 9 5 8 Pittsburgh International

Painting- and Sculpture had  ’
come to a close after _a two '
month run. . ,

The Forty-ﬁrst International
was undoubtedly the ‘most im-
portant event of the Bicenten-r = , A §‘<.,,,
nial celebration; thus far. Bringing together-- 589

 

, -paintings and, sculptural works from‘ over 30

countries, the International focused‘ international

, artistic attention, critical and appreciative, upon
Pittsburgh. When the statistics are compiled, as_

inevitably all statistics _must be, records will Tprob.-
~ably have been set for the largestattendance and

greatest number" of sales, to go along with the ‘rec- ’

ord number of works which were .0n'displa_y.
The paintings were curiously grouped according
to specie, rather than by nationalityor school.
Thus,. wholefrooms gave a disconcerting feeling,
at times, that the same artist had done every can-
vas in sight. - ,
7The sculpture, another “first” for the Carnegie
Prix, was scattered judiciously about, to provide
an occasional ﬂight back to reality and recogniz-
able form. Most of the large works were “planted”
in gravelbéds -— a touclr of stony horticulture for

display cases, defying circum=inspection but adding
the illusion‘-of priceless value. ’ '
Expressionism or Impressionism

The paintings emphatically affirmed the con-
temporary shift to the abstract — call it expres-
sionism or‘ timpressionism, as you choose. The
human form was indeed difficult to ﬁnd as’ was
semblance of representational
expression. '‘

Stated simply, ‘if you were trying to spot a col-
umn, a‘ cat, or a cloud, you were in real trouble.
But despite this direction -toward. the. completely
imaginative and purely subjective, the exhibition
was anexciting-one, and for several reasons.

First, the ‘American artists appeared to be forg-
ing into the vanguard of contemporary art. Franz
Kline’s enormous “Siegfried,” Mark Tobey’s- orien-
tal» “Symbols Over the West,”, Andrew ’Wyeth’s

popular landscape, ‘_‘Brown Swiss,” eMark Rothko’s ,

Strike the First Blow

   
   
 

“Number: 10,” were among the” most regularly
praised works in the show.

Second, the Japanese had given up much of
the delicatepast and turned to forceful expres-
sions ofmassive color and continual line. Hase-
'gawa’s bloody-"'"“Work,” and Shimomura’s ghostly
“Swamp” were examples of both. ,

Third, it was possible to ' distinguish, subjec-

abstraction.

_tl1at:-,a jsinglej work was no’ better than any other, in

.‘-the‘pl.irftely abstract. Inferior works and studied in-

difference, even boredom, were clearly onmdisplay.
The movement does seem to be slowly setting up

. béundaries and tentative values for itself, blasi

phemy though this may be to a concept predicated
V upon relativity. '
~.. Ridiculous to Sublime.
The sculpture ran the gamut from ridiculous to
almost sublime, V with Stanki'ewicz’s “Unlucky
House,” inthe ﬁrst category and,Pietro Consagra’s
.‘.‘Deep Colloquy,” in the second, for instance. The
retrospective display of 95 works from previous
Internationals was a superb review of 50 years of

’ I

modern art. The Bonnard’s, Picasso’s and our own’

“Old King,” by Rouault were particularly pleasing.

These three of the acknowledged masters of
the modern idiom were by no means they only
“famous” painters on display in the second ﬂoor
hall of history. The Winslow Homer and Johrr?

\ Singer Sargeant and "J ames Whistler pieces brought

back the images of -earlier heroes in_ American art.

Another of the virtues of the Retrospective was
that it‘ enabled_ the interested spectator to make
comparisons with works in,-the contemporary ex-
hibitions. No fewer than eight artists had works in
both shows. The admirer of the expressionism of
Oscar Kokoschka was able to visually place his
“Vienna Opera House” against the haunting ﬁgure
of Thomas Masaryk.

The legion of Chagall devotees were delighted
by the're—appearance of “The Betrotha1,” a whim-
sical (what else?) study of a bride and groom, and
they could also ponder the newer features of his
ﬂoral display in the Contemporary.

, Gordon Washburn, Director of Carnegie Insti-
tute,‘and his Staff have done the city an immense
service with the International. Not only did the
show put Pittsburgh in the news ‘(a “sine qua
non” requirement for Bicentennial events), but it
made multitudes of people “art-conscious” for the
present moment. A continuation of such a feeling
is the necessary starting point forthe. long—awaited
awakening of art in Pittsburgh. '

Soviet Defense Minister Ro-

What this announcement
means, of course, is that we
Americans must: tighten our
belts and work harder to catch
up. That’s what some enthusi-
astic spokesman of the people

is going to say sometime next.

week.
Unending Race

The »only trouble, however, '

is that by the time we have a
pinpoint accuracy. missile with
a hydrogen warhead the Rus-
sians will undoubtedly have
advanced to the ‘cobalt_fwgi'rhe_ad

‘ stage. And then,"whenV -we" equal

that pinnacle of progress,‘-— they
will deceitefully and «ingenious-
ly roll off some sortof double-
warheaded ‘affair -— you know,
something that could add to_ the

ward march of y

»This -is ‘not an attempt to
sound irreverent or contemptu-
ous of world affairs, or doubt-
ful of our country’s capabilities,
or unpatriotic, or sacriligious, or
anything like that. All it is, is
an expression of the already
stale feeling that the arms race

has reached the point of futil-..

ity.' ,

Moreover, it has reached the
point where boasts of new de-
velopments on either side read-

13'-

ily induce a dull pang of nausea. .

Not‘ because of fear —— being in
the vicinity of a discharged“h’y-
drogen warhead would result in
less pain -than a hangnail —- but
because of the realization of the
-developments themselves.

Need For Speech
Occasionally certain men of
world achievement look around

and ﬁnd need to speak of the

situation. Men‘ such as Albert
Schweitzer and, Linus Pauling
talk about conscience, ‘morals,
ethics, and human responsibil-

ity. They are sincere,‘ they see-.
room for improvements -and new .

approaches, but unfortunately
their words quickly fade in a
realm ,whe_re nearly "everything
is either black_ or white.

‘Pauline says, “There is no
such thing ._as a clean bomb”
. . . Schweitzer says, “Superhu-
man reason must balance the
possession of superhuman
force,” — and the officials turn
their heads to watch another
blast. off. ' - A

Indeed, individuals with ideal-

" istic attitudes ﬁnd little place. in
 thecurrent scheme of things. In

 

Russia they probably pound
salt. Over here, in a country

founded on high principles, they

are subtly ignored or often sus-
piciously eyed as potential sub;
versives. -
Much more respected are the
hard-boiled realists, the men
who do not speculate about
what could be, or what should
be, but who vigorously jump
right into the existing confusion
and help keep the gears mesh-
ed. Like the top Air Force stra-
tegists who, according to “News-
week,” are urging our State De-

~ partment to adopt the following

policy: ,

“Stop promising piously that
the U.S. will not strike the ﬁrst
blow and never start a war.
Make it clear that we will do

‘just that if forced to by the),

Soviets.”
War Is Senseless
Now it is generallyconceded

1 that any modern war would re-

sult in two immediate losers and
an eventual dissipation of the
entire planet. Yet here are re-
sponsible leaders who, “if forced
to by the Soviets,” would be
willing to forego such considera-
tions and start pushing buttons.
Apparently they would see no
other alternatives. '

And this, with many varia-
tions, is the tragedy of the-evi-
dently purposeful arin’s race. It
not only'furthers the growth of
distrust and ‘ hatred. It kills
idealism and discourages new
ideas, and thus is capable o
obscuring anything but a force-
ful settlement to future differ-_
ences. 7  ~,  --

Big Play of ‘Pops’ Mesher ‘Cited

_   .As Current Bright Spot of Team
By LARRY HAGGERTY

The Panther basketeers will have an inactive weekend
as they await the invasion of highly rated: West Virginia and
its All—American candidate, Jerry West, a week from tonight
at the Field House. The Mountaineers captured the ﬁrst meet-
ing at Morgantown last’ week by‘ a 73-64 score.

“I’ll havethe varsity practice a few defenses. that we’ll

use against"West{ Virginia and?’

teams to give them e rk”
Coach Bob Tim- " ' ‘
mons ‘announced.
S0 ' far this
season the Blue
and Gold" have
-been able to win
—only seven of 19
contests. (They
played Carnegie
Tech at the
‘Skibo Gym last *3
night.) After the

V Panthers face Navy, Westminster

and Penn State to complete the

.1958-59 season. .

Simpson Returns
Lloyd Simpson, a 6-1 junior
from Irwin has rejoined the team
and is taking part in" light drills.
‘Simpson suﬁferedjan injury to the
cartilage in his left kneelin the
Panthers’ ﬁrst game of the cam-
paign against Michigan and has
been out of action.ever since.
“Simpson was my ﬁfth man
at the time and we sure have
missed his services,” Timmons
said. “He must develop an out-
side shot to be a good scorer,
but is a good driver and excel-
lent rebounder‘ for his size,” he
continued. - '
First-string forward‘ John Mills
is still favoring an ankle injury
that he suffered in practice before

the Holy Cross gamerbut will be

ready for duty against West Vir-
ginia. «\ ' .
, Mesher Bright Spot,
Although the Blue and Gold
hoopsters are not doing as well_
as they did last-season, one of the
brighter sides of the campaign has
been John (Pops) Mesher. The

6-1 senior from Donora started"
against Carnegie Tech about a_

month ago, after sitting on the
bench for. nine games.

He scored 16 points and
played a good all-around game.
“It was nice to see’ Mesher play
so well,” Timmons said after
the game. Mesher‘ has started

- every game since then andihas
teamed up with All-American
Don I-Iennon in the backcourt.
A father of ﬁve children,
Mesher, now 26, started school in
1949 and after quitting for a’ few
years, returned. “I admire a kid
like that,” declared ‘Athletic’ Di-
rector Tom Hamilton. _Even when
Mesher was proclaimed ineligible
last year, there was never any

questionabout taking his scholar-
ship because he,couldn’t play.
“Everything to Help”'
“When a boy wants to go to

V school that bad and is willing to.‘
sacriﬁce to do it, you want to do

everything to help him,’.’ Hamil-

ton added. “John is a credit not \

only to Pitt but also to Donora.”
Mesher has been nicknamed
“Pops”' by the local hoop
writers who also take their hats
“off to the kid from the Valley.‘
Timmons plans to keep Mesher
in the lineup for the remainder
of the year.
“Maybe. Mesher isn’t an All-
American. but ‘ recently Hennon

said, “A guy’ like Mesher deserves .

much. more credit Qian many

_players do, Maybe the‘ best word

to describe my running—mate,
would be ‘class.’ He sure has it
in my estimation.”

The Panthers have shown

(5-2 to date) is much_ improved

University Ad
For Exhibitiort

A University advertisement car-
ried in district papers last fall has
been accepted for exhibition by
the New York Art Directors Club.

The winning Pitt ad is the work

of Richard Oden, University artist _

in the department of publications.
Oden, a 1957 graduate of Carnegie

_( Institute of Technology, did both
' the art work and the copy for the

ad which was prepared for the
Pitt Evening division‘.

The advertisement will be ex-
hibited in the thirty—eighth an-
nual National Exhibition of Ad-
vertising and Editorial Art and
Design and will be reproduced‘ in
the Art Directors Club Annual
which will be published in the

’ "fall of 1959. ‘

The New York exhibition,
which will open March 31, is
considered the top printing de-
sign show of the year and the
Annual is distributed through-
out the country and abroad.

The winning ad was entered in
the categoi-gc“Design 01’ Complete

‘ Advertisement or Editorial Unit:

small space newspuper'ads.”‘ Se-
lectionk was based on the excel-
lence of the visual concept and in-
terpretation of the design problem
with awareness of its function in.
the particular category.
