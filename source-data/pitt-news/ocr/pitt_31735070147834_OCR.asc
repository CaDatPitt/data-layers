A Pitt professor resigned Satur-

with those of the University. ‘

Conrad “Dan” Volzjr. said that
he-is resigning over a “difference
of opinion between the University
and me of the proper advocacy in

Volz, the director of the Center
for,Healthy Environments & Com-

In the ﬁnal moments of the Pitt
Dance Marathon, everyone was
exhausted.

The once-energetic dance
moves had slowly waned until
the 66 dancers participating just
swayed to the music. But in the
last minutes of the 24-hour char-

ity event, “Sweet Caroline” burst I

over the speakerphone, spurring
a ﬁnal rally amongst the crowd.

Despite being tired and hun—
gry, the dancers huddled together
and sang along to the Pitt tradi-
tion.

The marathon was over,
and they had raised more than
$30,000. It was $20,000 less

than the organizers’ goal, and

they attributed it to a change in
the marathon’s format. Matthew
Balsbaugh, one of the organizers,
said that they lowered the spon-
soring fees for dancers —— their
main source of donations — to
try and make it more accessible
to non— Greek organizations.
The annual Pitt Dance Mara-
thon, sponsored by Greek Life,
took place this weekend from 6
p.m. Friday to 6 p.m. Saturday in a
tent on Bigelow Boulevard. Danc-
ers from 29 Greek organizations
— and for the first time, non—
Greek organizations like Black
Action Society —— spent 24 hours
on a temporary dance ﬂoor in the
middle of Bigelow Boulevard.
All proceeds generated from

fees — paid by organizations to .

sponsor.dancers — went to the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute, which plans to use
the money to’ build a lung and
thoracic cancer laboratory. It is
part of a six-year long $500,000

Pitt students danced for 24 hours over the weekend’ to raise money for the University- of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

fundraising drive from the Greek
community.

Stacey Gnora, one of the event’s

organizers, said that before this
year’s PDM, the Greek community
had passed the $425,000 mark.
By the end of this year, it might
reach its goal. .
. Since 2005, Greek Life has
been the main group involved in
PDM,. This year, however, more
organizations participated in
sponsoring dancers.

Freshman Carmen Mitchell-
sponsored by the Black Action
Society — said she had a personal
reason for participating.

“I’m doing this for my grand-

mother and aunt who both had
cancer. Also, for the people who
died of cancer and the people who
survived like my aunt,” Mitchell
said. She added that her aunt’s
breast cancer is in remission.
PDM will continue as a part
of Greek Week, but after the
$500,000 is met, its revenue
mightbenefit another charity,
Balsbaugh said. He said that any

. change to where the-money goes

will be determined by next year’s
organizers. ;
“Hopefully by the end of the

year with all of our fundraising’
efforts we will reach that goal,”
Gnora said.

Because this year’s location
was outside on the Boulevard, the
event attracted moreattention
from non—Greek students, said
Matt Balsbaugh, one of the event’s
organizers. V

During the Techno I-Iour, from
2 a.m. to 4 a.m. Saturday, “it was
literally packed from the front of
the stage to the back of the tent,”
‘one of the event’s organizers, Ni-
cole Elfner said. I V -

“It looked like an exclusive
club with everyone lined up and
security guards at the door,” she
added. '

But the dance party wasn’t
necessarily the highlight of the

night.

Zach Weber said his favorite
part was listening to Shawn Berry
speak. Berry was a former patient
at UPCI and came to talk about
the importance of donating to
cancer research. -_ .

“He was a graduate from Pitt,
so it was very personal. The mood
went from intense dancing to

, shock and awe and then back to

intense dancing,” he said.

1 Despite being awake for so
long, many dancers were able
to stay energetic throughout the
event.

GPSA delays election

The Graduate and Professional Student

Assembly is withholding the results of last
week’s elections until todaybecause of a
number of unspeciﬁed “complications.”
“There’s a really good reason for this,”
chairman of the elections committee Kaw_a
Shwaish said. The Joseph M. Katz Gradu-
ate School of business student added that
lie was.“not at liberty” to say more on the
situation. .

Saturday morning. ,

The candidates will now ﬁnd out the
results some timetoday. Shwaish said the
committee chose to delay the decision _—
typically made the Saturday after the elec-
tion — partly because of last year’s con-

. troversy.

When N ila Devanath won the presidency
last year, some people, including other can-
didates, questioned Devanath’s eligibility
because she was an undergraduate at the
time of the election.

The elections committee members, whose
terms had already ended, were forced to re-
convene and discuss the issue at hand.

As current chairman of the elections com-
mittee, it is Shwaish’s job to notify all of the
candidates this morning. .

The Assembly Board, composed of repre-

sentatives from each graduate school, will be

notiﬁed next, Shwaish said. The announce-

ment will then be posted on the GPSA website

for the public sometime in the afternoon.
The candidates had different responses

‘ to the delayed results.

Student relay raises  
money to ﬁght cancer

Tegan Hanlon
Staﬁ Writer

Trey Draude attended Pitt’s Relay For Life to
walk for his sister.

The Pitt sophomore walked on Friday for

juniorjordyn Martin, who was diagnosed with
leukemia when she was only 13 years old.

“I saw my sister become a different person
emotionally and physically,” he said.

Draude stood onya stage on the Cathedral
of Learning’s mud- covered lawn to share how
cancer personally affected his family, while
participants in the Relay walked around the
perimeter to ﬁindraise for the American Can'-
cer Society. _ '

The ACS sponsored a shopping spree for
Jordyn after she was diagnosed, and Draude
said that for the ﬁrst time since she found out

she had the disease, he saw his sister smile. ~ '

Martin fully recovered from the disease and
is currently studying abroad in-Spain. Draude

’ said his sister sent him to the Relay with a

message for the walkers. _
“She wanted to say: Thanks for saving my
life,” he said. — . .
It was inspirational stories like Draude’s

 

to 8 a.m. Saturday. -

that motivated participants in Colleges Against
Cancer’s Fourth Annual Relay For Life to brave
the cold weather and walk for a cure.

By the end of the weekend the participants
collectively raised more than $105,000 for

. the American Cancer Society, surpassing their

$100,000 goal.

Ninety-ﬁve teams of students and Pitts-
burgh community members, many dressed
in rain boots, hats and sweatshirts, walked
around the path between the Cathedral and
Heinz Memorial Chapel from Friday at 5 p.m.

Junior Taylor McKelvie,who co-chairs the
Relay For Life committee, said that despite the
weather,_around 400 people attended the event

_ throughout the night. While 1,000 participants

were originally signed up, most did not stay
the entire 15 hours. ~

“We had a lot of people going inand out,”

she said. '

McKelvie said most teams planned it out so
that one person from each team would walk
two to three hours during the night — leav-

ing about 100 participants constantly on the .

path. . . ‘

“Cancer never sleeps, so we stayed up all

The rain subsided for most of the night, but
showers prior to the event left the walkways
and the grass area muddy. ’ _
“Although the ground wasn’t ideal, at least
water wasn’t falling on us,” McKelvie said:
Participants set up their tents and on—site
fundraisers around the pathways — bake sales,

corn hole and non—alcoholic pong were just a .

few of the ways participants brought in some
extra money. _
McKelvie said the Relay For Life Committee
was very pleased at the amount of teams that
decorated their tents with the Las Vegas theme
to go along with the “Beat the Odds” Relay.

graduate students. For $2, Elvis would not only
“marry” two people, but also provide them with
photo evidence of the matrimony.

Captain Sarah Hainer said the team had

‘raised $1,600 prior to the event through a de-
partment happy hour and e-mails to friends

and family. They hoped. to raise more at their
“wedding” fundraiser. , '

“We even have props — top hats, veils, a
bow—tie,” she said. ~

Members of Pitt’s Nursing School also made’

an appearance at the event. The team of 20
students had two members running a bake sale
and taking blood pressure for $1 while the rest
of the team walked the path.

“If their blood pressure is within the normal

« safe range, they get a piece of candy,” junior
Michael DiTommaso said. '

His team prepared for its overnight stay
with “a lot of extra socks.” ‘

Team Homo Sapiens set up its tent-‘afew feet
away from team Nursing School. The team of
11 students from Pitt, IUP and Carnegie Mellon
also held a bake sale with homemadecookies

._ and brownies.

To capture the essence of Las Vegas,'the
team members served non—alcoholic mocktails.
Their best seller was the one dollar Shirley
Temple, said co-captain sophomore Emily
Rowe.

VanArsdale said her team members re-
mained enthusiastic despite the weather as they
took turns running home to change clothes.

“Luckily we set the tent up in the middle of
the rain,” VanArsdale joked.

In the past four years, the Relay has grown .

from 19 teams raising $13,000 to 95 teams
raising more, than $100,000 this weekend.

. The chair of the committee, seniorjade
Holtzinger, said the event continues to grow
every year —— this year’s Relay raised $25,000
more than last year’s. . _

“I hope to see it as big as Thon someday,” she
said, referring to Penn State’s dance marathon,
which raised more than $9 million this year for

Is all inﬁdelity

equal?

Apparently Ke$ha’s not the only
one getting sleazy.

CNN blogger Ian Kerner, a sex
counselor and New York Times
best—selling author, reported last
week that experts agree that fe-
male inﬁdelity is on the rise.

Before you question what your
girlfriend actually does on “girls’

night,” know that Kerner admits '

that he knows of no actual sta-
tistics supporting the idea that
more women are cheating.

Nonetheless, Kerner argues
that female inﬁdelity is more
damaging and more. likely to
ruin a relationship than male
inﬁdelity. .

“Male cheating is deﬁnitely
harmful,” Kerner said. “But when
a woman fools around, it’s often
the death knell to a couple’s re-
lationship.” l

He backs this up with the as-
sumption that men cheat for sex
while women cheat for love. But
from what we’ve encountered
through exposure to the college
hookup culture, we don’t think

‘ this assumption is accurate

enough for any argument.
With no statistics on which
to base his claims, we feel Kern-

‘ er makes wide generalizations

about cheating that are poten-
tially damaging to both sexes.
Not only are his ideas antiquated,
but he also stereotypes men and
women, and in doing so promotes
a double standard for cheating.
We’d be more willing to for-
give Kerner if he had a message
other than, “If you think your girl
would never cheat, think again.
Here are some signs she might
be playing you.” '
We agree that changing social

' dynamics might cause a surge in

unfaithful wo men. Even our expe-
riences on campus demonstrate a

hookup culture in which it’s not
just the guys who are looking to
score.

, A University of Washington
study found that those who
earned $75,000 or more a year
were 1.5 times more likely to
cheat than those earning less
than $30,000 a year. Accord-

ing to Kerner, the fact that more _
women are in the workforce and.

asserting ﬁnancial independence
might mean more women cheat-
ing. Instead of focusing on the
fact that women are occupation-

ally and economically gaining ‘

ground and in some instances
surpassing their male counter-
parts, Kerner focuses on the fact
that this is turning women into
cheaters. ' A ‘

In addition, he argues that the
Internet is responsible for the
rise in female affairs. But we feel
that not only women’s ﬁdelity is
compromised with the onslaught
of social -networking and even
cheating dating services. Aren’t
men also tempted bythe ease of
online lovers?

Regardless of changing social
dynamics or whether or not more

women are indeed straying from '

their boos, it’s still unfair to say

that female inﬁdelity is differ- .

ent — and according to Kerner
— worse than male inﬁdelity. We
feel this simply cannot be gen-
eralized.

And rather than analyzing

guesswork on the differences,
= between unfaithful guys and gals,

maybe instead we could focus on
what types of relationships are
prone to cheating. ’

Of course, every individual
has a different idea of what even
constitutes cheating. What’s slea-
zy to you might not be sleazy to

tion value of the music video is 3.Cl1l-
ally pretty good, and Black is on—key
throughout. Say what you will, but ei-
ther Black or whoever did the mixing
is not tone—deaf. Whatis objectionable
is the young phenom’s execrable tone
qua1ity- . I
So, we have a bad music video,
one of many. What makes Black’s hit
uniqueisthatthis is apopularbad mu-
sic video that has gotten all the way
up to number 26 on the list of most
popular iTunes downloads. Bad music
videos areeasytounderstand. Whatis
not easyto understandiswhy so many
people feel compelled to throw good
money after bad music.

teurish andpotentiallybad psychology.
Not that I mind engaging in bad psy-
chology: Ifit’s bad enough, maybethis

don’t want to be less hip because we

So, why people listen to her song

,What doesn’t make sense is why so

many people who hate Blackwill gladly

I’ve ‘spent a lot of time wishing that _

Tina Fey could write my life story.
I know that she’s probably busy
taking down Regina George and
calling out the girls who don’t even
go to this school, but I’m sure that
she could ﬁnd some time for me.

, Between her being Liz Lemon and
' keeping Alec Baldwin from self-

my love. ’ '

There’s a reason that I admire ~

Fey’s talents so much —' she makes

Of course today, there’s more
to be concerned with than what
someone wrote about youin a burn
book. What with Libya’s leader Col-
onel Gadhaﬁ ruining facial hair for
every still-going—through—puberty

college guy and Japan ‘on nuclear

that could distract us from global
stresses.. You know, not too much

coming up on the agenda in the ‘

world other than the whole Mayan
apocalypse thing. ,
Well, there is something going

awesome. Who needs suspense

doing ﬂips. She also is over the age
of 12, but that should be irrelevant.
Cough, China, cough.

Olympics are like the season ﬁ-
nale of Lost -— everyone decides to
watch something that they would
never sit down and watch other-
wise, all the while pretending to
understand what’s going on: see

a Libertarian.

If the Olympics were in Pitts-

event (the real American kind),
and baseball would be played in
a gorgeous stadium. Granted, the

I’ve recently spent a lot of time
-around the location of the up-
coming 2012 Olympic Games in

v London. Unfortunately, I haven’t

been able to go swimming with

a. Michael Phelps. The weird thing

is that British people just don’t
seem to understand exactly what
matters in the Olympics. The bas-
ketball stadium looks like a gigan-
tic tent, but the cycling arena is
immaculate. Seriously Brits? They
actually care about rowing for this
Olympics! Rowing? Rowing? If I

That’s right: If America isn’t go-
ing to win it, then it doesn’t matter
in my opinion. The Vietnam War -
won’t ﬁnd it in my history book.

Though I hate that London

So as much as I love America
and am already planning the vic-
tory party, I must say that living
in London has given me a chance
to see the Olympics preparation
done right. The Beijing Olympics
were full of stories about the side-
effects of the games. People were
relocated and the country’s human
rights issues were brought to the
forefront of media attention.

London, as was inevitable, has
had its issues with creating space
to house the games. But the efforts
have been entirely centered on re-

d development of poorer areas of

the city. Instead of the endless sto-
ries we hear about the rich getting

all over the world, these Olympic
Games provide us with an excel-
lent opportunity to remember why
these events mean so much.-

The Olympics -harbor meaning '
_ beyond just the medals awarded

to the athletes. These games are
the human race’s chance to show
how fast, strong and skilled we can
be. They also offer us a chance to
show how humane, supportive and

cooperative our world can be. The»-

London Olympics will be giving
back to the British communities
that need it most. So even if the
actual games are still a ways off,
continue to plan yourvictory par-
ties for the U.S. Remember though,
there’s more to the Olympics than
just kicking China’s butt. '

Songbird talks abou baan musical -rowth

Emma Kilcup
Staff Writer

Sara Bareilles with Elizabeth
and the Catapult and Ximena
Sariﬁana S
Carnegie Music Hall of Home-
stead

7:30 p.m. today

Tickets Sold Out

Sara Bareilles’ latest hit, “Unchart-
ed,” is — contrary to its title —-
climbing up the charts, already at
No. 8 on VH1’s Top 20.

Currently on the tour for her-
latest album, Kaleidoscope Heart,

the “Love Song” singer still tries to i

stay connected with fans through
her blog and has remained involved
in her philanthropic efforts by liv-
ing without shoes for a day to raise
awareness about children without
footwear and by recording a song
for a tsunami relief album.

-The singer is performing at Car— '

negie Music Hall of Homestead to-
day at 7:30 p.m. She will be joined
by acts Elizabeth and the Catapult
and Ximena Sariﬁana. Before she
arrives, The Pitt News got the chance
to talk with her about playing for
the President, her philanthropic
works and growing musically with
her newest album.

The Pitt News: The last time
you were in Pittsburgh was during
the G—20 summit to perform for the
diplomats. How was that experi-
ence? ‘

Sara Bareilles: It was amaz-
ing, just totally fascinating. It was
the ﬁrst time that I was involved in
anything on the political spectrum
and it was so great to be a part of
it. Getting to know the ﬁrst lady
was such an honor. It was also so
nerve—wracking. I was shaking in
my boots. I was just so terriﬁed to

perform for them -—— I’m not usually .

that nervous.

TPN: I know that you have

opened for Barack Obama on nu-
merous occasions and Billboard.
com described you as_aWhite House
favorite. How do you feel about this
title?

SB: Aw, that makes me smile,
but it’s so silly. I can’t believe that

I’ve performed for the presidential
family on multiple occasions — it’s
such an honor. I’ve always been a
supporter of Obama so it’s great to
be able to show my support in that
way and it’s an honor that they enjoy
my music.

TPN: Well, along with being
politically active, I see from your
blog that you are also, very philan-
thropically active with causes like
TOMS’ One Day Without Shoes and
a tsunami relief album. How do you
make time for it all?

SB: The philanthropic efforts are
one of the most important parts of

my career. They are one of the most ,

important places you can put your
energy. I feel that it’s my duty to be
active — it’s an amazing platform
to bring awareness and inspiration.
We all have ways to contribute and
not all are ﬁnancial, but everybody

can help in their own way. I would 
‘be selﬁsh to not beinvolved.

TPN: You seem to update your
blog often with bits of news and

personal messages to those who '

keep up with your website. Do you
ﬁnd that helps connect you to your
fans? ‘

SB: Most deﬁnitely. I love the
one—on—one interactions most. I
didn’t get Twitter initially, I didn’t
understand the purpose. But it’s a
great way to stay connected. I’ve
been a stickler about writing public
messages myself. I don’t like to feel
like there is anybody speaking for
me. I like to feel like I have the con-
trol and power to speak for myself.

TPN: Your ﬁrst megahit, “Love
Song,” makes some sarcastic jabs at
relationships. The sassy messages
are similar to those in your latest

hit, “King of Anything.” What is your _

inspiration behind these songs?

SB: (laughs a bit) Well, my inspi-
ration comes from a creative place.
There was a lot of pressure to write,
and “King of Anything’? was about
getting feedback. I was out of prac-
tice with receiving criticism. So I

. received feedback and then went

back and recorded the song in an
hour and a half. Everybody can re-
ally relate —- we’ve all met people
who think they can run our lives.

April i1, 2011 I The Pitt News I Wvvw.pittneWs;com

TPN: In an. interview with
Billboard you describe your lat-
est album, Kaleidoscope Heart,
as “interesting” and “a little more
quirky-sounding.” How do you
think your music has changed or
progressed since your ﬁrst album?

SB: I think it’s more mature

sounding. I took risks and made a
conscious choice to branch out as
a piano player and singer. I tried to
make strides forward. I never want
to compromise my music. The bot-
tom line is that the song has to be

great alone. I care about these songs .

and I’m proud of the way they turned
out. -

TPN: You also mention that

you worked with Neal Avron who

is known for working with artists‘

like Weezer and Say Anything who
have more of a rock sound. How did
this inﬂuence your latest record?

SB: We were both dedicated to
the idea that the song comes ﬁrst
— we had to love it. And the pair-
ing worked- because I have a more
conservative side and he is known

‘to have a harder edge, which helped

dictate the path for the album. I re-

ally loved working with him — he .

is so talented.

TPN: As you continue to collabo-
rate with various artists, including
Pharrell Williams recently, are there
any who have been particularly in-
ﬂuential?

A ~ ‘ - MCT Campus
Singer Sara Bareilles‘ will sing and play songs from her album Kaleidoscope Heart in Pittsburgh tonight.

SB: I’ve had some amazing ex-

’ periences.-I hada great weekend in

New York with the‘Roots and I’ve

.written a song via e—mail. There
is not one in particular that I can

choose. They have all been inspir-
ing and great learning experiences.
I came away feeling like a stronger
artist after each. I’ve collaborated

_ ‘with some great artists so far, and I

think that there will be more collab-
oration during my next chapter.

:-

TPN: Dolyouhave any ideas of

people you’d like to collaborate with

up

in the future?

SB: Yes, I’d love to collaborate

with Chris Martin from Coldplay ‘

and Cee L0 Green.

MOVIE REVIEW

Movie shows animal and human connection

Swama Sunkara
For The Pitt News

“Born to Be Wild”
Directed by: David Lickley

 Starring: Morgan Freeman, Birute Galdi-
kas and Daphne Sheldrick
Grade: B+
If you can’t go see real wild orangutans,
you can still see them in 3-D.

“Bom to Be Wild” is a ﬁlm that is surprisingly
simplistic but exceptionally effective in its
delivery. It is a 40-minute movie that centers
on the rescue stories of young orangutans
and elephant orphans raised in captivity with

the hope that rescuers will one day be able,

to release them back into the wild.

The cinematography of the ﬁlm ~— a na-
ture documentary in 3-D — is breathtak-
ing. The audience members feel like they are
personally escorted on a long stroll through
the forests of Borneo and Nairobi, Kenya.

Yet what captivates the audience right away
is the booming voice of the narrator, Mor-
gan Freeman.‘ Opening the movie with the
line, “This story is like a fairy tale, except
it’s entirely true,” Freeman’s warm voice
brings phenomenal storytelling and a per-
sonal quality to the stories of these young
endangered orphans. He hooks viewers in
with his candidness and humor, taking the
animals’ behavior and relating it to humans
or life philosophies.

While it is easy to claim that the movie is

no more entertaining than most nature docu-
mentaries, it is considerably lighter and more
upbeat than a National Geographic movie.
The addition of pop songs like Hank Wil-
liams’ “Jambalaya,” and Mel Tormé’s “Comin’
Home Baby!” adds some personality to the
animals’ lives. V

In essence, the ﬁlm celebrates the struggle
of two courageous women who live across
the globe from each other. They have their
own stories to share about their rescues of
orphaned animals and their experiences in
raising them for the wild.

Birute Galdikas, a researcher on the island
of Borneo whose career) progressed from
studying orangutans to saving them, is the
central ﬁgure of one story depicted in the
movie. The orangutans’ homes are being
destroyed to make room for palm oil planta-
tions. Galdikas’ team rescues the surviving
apes — a few of which have'even been taken
by the local population as pets — and raises
the young to be suited for life in the wild.

Her-staifis composed of humans who
become mothers to the orphaned orang-
utans, feeding, bonding with and singing
lullabies to the young animals. They keep just

enough distance to let the orangutans remain _
‘ i“wild,” while at the same time being close

enough to build “life—long friendships,” as the
ﬁlm 5eautiﬁi113i'i1ru'§trates.‘once th'ey’i*e old
enough, the animals are taken to a national
park and released.

Daphne Sheldrick represents the other

side of the story: She takes care of elephant
orphans because their moms are being

poached for their ivory tusks. For half a cen-
tury, Sheldrick has been attempting to perfect
anelephant baby formula and has dedicated
her life to raising healthy orphan elephants
so they can- return to the wild as a herd.

On the one side, as a simple and education-
al movie about the bonding between humans
and animals, this ﬁlm is probably best suited
for kids. On the other side, it is an optimistic
narrative of rescued endangered orphans
that combines nature and philosophy with
a twist of humor and makes- for a pleasantly

V satisfying ride through what Galdikas calls

the “original Garden of Eden.” I

Freshman pitcher Karlyn Jones (N o. 26) set a Pitt record by winning eightof her ﬁrst 10 starts.

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ" Writer

With eight wins in her ﬁrst 10 ap-
pearances, Pitt freshman Karlyn
Jones boasts the best start for any
freshman pitcher in the history of
the Pitt softball program.
‘ So far this season, Jones has
‘racked up an 8-3 record and a 1.22
ERA, which ranks her second in
the Big East.Jones didn’t predict
the early successes or the wide-
open opportunity to lead Pitt to
victory when she arrived on cam-
pus" this year.
“Coming in as a freshman,
I had an idea that I would play,
but not to the extent that I have,”
Jones said. ‘.‘I am grateﬁil for the
trust that Coach [Holly Aprile]
puts in me with ‘each start.”
Aprile said that she sees Jones

as a perfect ﬁt for her starting

pitcher rotation, especially given

Jones’ demeanor on the mound.
“Karlyn never gets too high or

too low,” Aprile said. “That at- A

titude allows her to focus on her

pitching.”

Jones’ pitching statistics put

her in the top tier of the Big East, A

and she is no stranger to such suc-
cess. She earned many accolades

during her high school pitching‘

career at ‘Spanish Springs High

' School in Nevada.

As a senior,Jones led her team

to the 2010 Class 4A state title V

and wasnarned the Las Vegas
Review-J'ou,rnal’s Class 4A State
Player of the Year. She ﬁnished

with a 24-1 record and recorded I

229 strikeouts.

ButJones considers the honors .

and awards simply a byproduct

of diligence,-as she. chooses to.

place her focus on the details of
her game. i .

“When I had my eighthrwin

was a freshman record through 10

. ence in the style of play between

high school and college. ’

“In high school, I just went af—
ter the batter and the strikeout,”
Jones said. “Now I see that I need
to be more concerned with pitch
placement and focus in on each
batter.”

GuidingJones through the sea-

’ son are two pitchers with more

collegiate experience. J _
The other two starters in the

I ' Panther pitching rotation, Alyssa

0’Connell_and Cory Berliner, are

_ both experienced seniors who are

passing on their knowledge to a
grateful Jones.

“Alyssa and'Cory have been in-
credibly helpful in guiding me so
far this year,”Jones said. “When—
ever I struggle with something,
even my mechanics, I knowl can
go to them for advice.”

Aprile said she’s also noticed
O’Connell’s and Berliner’s lead-
ership. 

“Karlyn is able to learn so
much from Alyssa and Cory, and
hopefully that will continue to
be an advantage,” Aprile said.-
“Anything Karlyn can take from
their experiences will help her as
a pitcher.”

Berliner recently became the
leader in career wins in Pitt his-
tory, and O’Connell«leads the‘ Big
East in ERA and opponent batting
average.» '-

As the two senior pitchers fo-

cus on the last season of their im-
pressive careers, they also recog-
nize the responsibility they have
to share their experiences with
younger players like Jones.

. and it will prove even more valu-

able in the future after Berliner
and O’Connell graduate, leaving
Jones the only member of the”
pitching staff with college-level
experience.

The experience she gains this
season will allowJones to take on
the role of mentor for incoming
Pantherpitchers.

“We have two freshman pitch-

, ers coming in next,season,”Aprile ‘

said. “With Karlyn learning so
much this year, she will be able

_ to lead the newest members of

the rotation.”

Jones knows that her role wilfz ’

change in the coming years as she
emerges as the Panthers’ veteran
pitcher. .

“I understand that I will have to
take on the leadership role for the
pitching staff,”Jones said. “Right
now, I am just taking in everything
I can from Alyssa and Cory in
preparation for that time.” '

Currently though,Jones is still
a freshman adjusting to leaving
home and entering a new stage of__
life. With plenty to keep her busy,
she doesn’t spend time speculat-
ing about the future.

“It is deﬁnitely an adjustment
in transitioning to college, and
not just in terms of softball,”Jones
said. “Pittsburgh is a much bigger
city than Reno, Nev., and just get-
ting used to that is different.”

' z The move to the East Coast also
separated Jones from her family
members, but that does not stop
them from catching a. game when‘,
they can. _

“My family will be able to see
me pitch when they travel here
for the DePaul series on April 14,”
Jones said. “It’s nice to be in a new
place, but it’s also nice to have

family around sometimes.” I ’~"~"

When Jones’ family arrives to
watch her play, they’ll sit in the
new Petersen Sports Complex that
houses Panther softball, baseball
and soccer. The complex on up-

per campus ofﬁcially opened in.“

mid-March. _

Jones is the part of the ﬁrst class
that will spend all four years in the
state-of-the-artfacility, which she
calls a special opportunity. W

“The new ﬁeld is just awe-
some,” Jones said. “To be able t6‘¥”
play in a place that nice for my

. entire career is somethingl am re-
ally looking forward to doing.”I

Staﬁ” Writer

It has been a week of redemption for NFL

quarterbacks.

Two embattled professional QBs, Ben Ro-
ethlisberger and Erik Ainge, are trying to put
their ugly pasts in the rearview mirror. And as
members of a culture that loves the underdog,
we’re hoping to see them succeed. _

Roethlisberger, who has been accused by
not convicted of sexual assault twice since
2008, is engaged to be married. The engage-
ment conﬁrms a rumor that has been ﬂoating
around since beforelthe Super Bowl.

Ainge, the New Yorkjets backup, publicly
discussed a past alcohol and drug addiction
that has plagued him since he was 12 years
old. ~
The two-time Super Bowl champ Roethlis-

berger is less than ayear removed from facing ,

a sexual-assault complaint from a 20-year-old
college student who met him at a Georgia
nightclub. Although the authorities didn’t
bring charges against the Steelers quarter-
back, he did serve a four-game suspension

. at the beginning of this season.

Now Roethlisberger intends to marry girl-
friend Ashley Harlan onjuly 23.

The intended date of the’ wedding is a
week from the expected beginning of train-

. ing camp, pending the resolution of the N FL’s
_ current lockout.

“ “I think a small part of her is hoping we
hold out for a week so we can honeymoon,”
Roethlisberger told the Post— Gazette. “I told
her I was laughing with Coach [Mike] Tomlin;

he said, ‘You guys might have to have the ‘

honeymoon suite at Saint Vincent [College,
site of the Steelers’ camp.]”’ '

Roethlisberger met Harlan, a physician’s
assistant, at training camp in 2005, and they
havebeen friends ever since. He announced
that he expects 500 people to attend the wed-
ding, and instead of bringing gifts they will
be asked to make donations to a charitable
foundation.

While Roethlisberger’s past troubles have

been well documented, Ainge’s have been _

private, known only to close friends, family

Quarterbacks earn redemption

and a few of his teammates on the Jets. Ac-
cording to a ﬁrst—person account published
on ESPN .com, Ainge has been sober for nine
months, the longest such stretch since he
ﬁrst used drugs.

Ainge started using drugs when he was
young and continued to use through high
school and college, when his usage hit a peak.

- Having abused cocaine, heroin, prescrip-

tion painkillers and alcohol, Ainge said he
“would’ve made Charlie Sheen look like Miss
Daisy.” The quarterback claims to have taken
25 Percocet three times a day when he was
at his worst.

Ainge developed his painkiller addiction
in college, when he battled avariety of injuries
while starting at the University of Tenn_es—
see, where he played for four years During
the 2008 season — his rookie year — he
was suspended after failing a drug test. Last
season, he did not play because he was in and
out of rehab. ~ I '

Now, Ainge is living in Boston with his
uncle, former NBA player and current Execu-
tive Director of Basketball Operations for the
Boston Celtics Danny Ainge and has been
taking medication for bipolar disorder, some-
thing he says has helped tremendously. ‘

Erik Ainge has several tattoos that remind
him of his past and keep him moving in the
right direction — and not ‘all of the markings
are good. Ainge-claims to have no memory of
having “Crazy White Boy” seared across his
shoulder blades, but the tattoos on his wrists
he d_oes remember, and they are comforting.

Those read O.D.A.T., T.T.S.-P. andJ.F.T. —— “One a

Day At a Time,” “This Too Shall Pass,” and
“Just For Today.” I

If one young athlete “hears this interview
and sees that it’s OK to ask for help, it’s OK to
be vulnerable,”. Erik Ainge says, his decision
to go public will have been worth it.

As both quarterbacks continue down the
road to recovery and redemption, America
will watch them closely. There’s nothing
fans love more than a good comeback story,
whether it involves a maturing lifestyle or a
recovery from a lifelong addiction to drugs
and alcohol. . _

I know I’ll keep pulling for the under-

dog. I

ished with a season-high three hits, while

Pitt took the lead in the third inning
when senior Travis Whitmore scored John
