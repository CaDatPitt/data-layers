Woshington—“Hope|ess|y ldeolistic?"

by KARK BALDYS
Pitt News Feature Writer

WASHINGTON — Countryside.
Small towns. The Pennsylvania
Turnpike. My anxious anticipa-
tion that had develped before this
trip to Washington began was only
heightened by the rising of the sun
over peaceful surroundings. Yel-
low porch lights, the kind that
glare at you in the darkness, be-
gan to pale. I wondered how these
people. who everyone is fighting
to protect. would react to the In-.
tor the “Inhogura-‘
tion“ designed by the yippies) of
.Richard Nixon. Perhaps the eve-
ning news would bring both to
their attention. '

Following the directions pro-
vided to me by the SDS at Pitt, I
found a demonstration already in
progress at Washington‘s Union
Station. The SDS marchers hadn‘t

arrived yet. It was about 10:15.’

The protesters were chanting slo-
gans and a speaker was attacking
Nixon as  . . the greatest killer
since Adolf Hitler." Along the
street corner, at a reasonable dis-
tance, was a long line of helmeted
police officers. They smilled oc-

casionally an_d politely refrained

I Political Parody Highlights  

by JOHN A. CAPITMAN

"Peace is in your hands. Presi-
dent Nixon. so we say to you. stop
the war. sign the treaty. get out of
Vietnam!“ said John Harre of the
\l.ew American Movement (NAM)
at a 12 noon rally held in Market
Square on Friday.

The anti-war protest. sponsor-
ed by a coalition of various local
organizations. including the NAM.
Medical Aid for Indochina. Na-
tional Peace Action Coalition. and
the Indochina Peace Campaign.
was preceeded by a “funeral
march."

The march started at 11 a.m. at
the Federal Building and went to
the offices of United States Steel,
North American Rockwell, Gulf
Oil, and _ Alcoa, Alumonum. Lead-
ing the procession were two stu-

. dents in black cloaks and white

circus‘ make-up, followed -by

“DON'T PAROVOKE the police.”

a leaflet. Police photographers
were clicking away. A kind of pa-

ranoia settled over me as I read ,

the opening lines.

"Thousands of crazed YIPsters
are bringing the theatre of the
streets to the Capitol Jan. 20 to
mimic Nixon's theatre of the sew-
er; ‘Ratsketeer‘\ suits from the
black markets of Disneyland will
be distributed and a 30 foot "King
Rat‘ float (named milhaus)‘ will
be pulled by the tail in a ‘Super
Cheese Bowl‘ style parade . . . to
Union Station.“

North Vietnames flags unfurled.
the demonstration began to heat
up as “the pigs" were verbally

assaulted. There were police in-

every direction. approximately
one officer every 20 feet. One
speaker called Washington "a

» minimum security jail.‘-‘ Another

demonstrator masquerading ‘as
Nixon with Mousketeer ears

thrust his hands up in victory as

the American flag was set on fire.

The flag was used to light a
bonfire of garbage and dead rats.
As the crowd grew more energet-
ic, the suggestion was made to
march through the streets. I
walked over to a sergeant for an
official police reaction.

"Yes". sir. May I help you? Oh.
I'd say about 450-500 yippies are
here. . . but the SDS is on the way.

Later. at the Market Square
Rally. speakers Anne Hill from
Medical Aid for Indochina and
Dave Urbaitis from the Pitts-
burgh Anti-War Coalition urged
the audience “to become involved
in the struggle in their own com-
munities."

A. new speaker rises. “Some
people have suggested building a
giant ratrap to putgthe squeeze
on Nixon. . . . The reason he spent
billions of dollars to get to the
moon is because he still believes
its made of cheese. " ‘

The National Peace Action Coal-
tion (NPAC) was sponsoring ‘a big
rally at the Washington Monu-
ment. The SDS was marching.
The yippies finally became rest-
less when the Women's Strike
for Peace came into view. The
women had no banners or signs.
No “Remember Kent State” or
“Heil King Rat.” The group of
predominately middle-aged men
and women walked silently by and
a yippie yelled. “Take the rat to
Nixon.” '

. War whoops gathered force.
and. falling in behind the women.
the yippes moved forward. They
walked about two blocks before a
few hundred police on motor
scooters, in squad cars, and on
foot. cut the yippies and myself
off from the march.

A black man standing next to
me started repeating. "This is it.
They drew the line.“ I hurried out
of the way before a string of po-
lice finally faced off the demon-
strators. It all looked frightening.
The police confiscated the rat

M and set ‘him on the corner of the

lawn surrounding the VFW na-
tional. headquarters. The yippies
were cut in half. The police herded
some onto the sidewalk with their
backs to a five foot hedge. Others
could still move back to the orig-

.inal protest site. and more police

began to shove them in that direc-

tion.

Suddenly the war whoops gain-
ed strength and the yippies jump-
ed through the hedge towards the
Capitol. More police, on motor
scooters headed the group off" at
the next corner, and the rally was
effectively dispersed.

I then tried to cross Pennsyl-
vania Ave. to get to the NPAC ral-
ly at the Washington Monument.
But. the police firmly refused to

allow anyone without credentials '

to cross. The inaugural parade
slowly marched down .Pennsyl-
vania Ave. The President went
y and there was a mixture of
cheers and insults. The crowd
was ‘peppered with protestors

along the route. Silent protesters

held signs reading "Sign Now,"
“End the War,“ “Impeach Mad
Dog.“ At one point a group of pro-
test/ers beganto chant "Ho. Ho,
Ho Chi Minh, the NLF Is Gonna
Win." . -

About two hours later I finally
circumvented the parade route
and the security police and ar-
rived at the main demonstration
in front of the Washington Monu-
ment. Here the speakers urged
peaceful protest. but‘a few of the
demonstrators began tearing
down the flags surrounding the
monument and setting them on

scrawled in red on the obelisk.

asked the people to “. . . come

LTeach-in Held to Prevent Fut

by LARRY PANSINO

With the signing of a Vietnam
peace treaty impending in Paris.
the anti-war teach—in held last
Thiirsday at 4 p.m. in the Student
Union Ballroom focused on chang-
ing American society so as to pre-
vent future Vietnams.

The speakers expressed bitter-
ness over the prolongment of the
war and the resulting misery for
the Vietnamese people, blaming
Nixon for imposing the will of the
United States government on
what the speakers viewed as a
civil conflict.

Eight speakers addressed an
audience of about 300 people who
attended the 90 minute session.
The eight included Monsignor
Charles Owen Rice of the Holy
Rosary Church, Audrey Holland
of the College of Arts and Sci-
ences, Robert Colodny of the His-
tory Department, Marcia Landy
of the English Department, Jack
Hayes of the Office of Veterans
Affairs, undergraduate Kathy Da-
vis, David Montgomery of the
History Department, and Theo-
dore Windt of the Speech Depart-
ment.

_-x Monsignor Rice, a long-time 10-

A cal anti-war priest, began the pro-

 [gram with an invocation. Compar-

ing the President with Hitler, At-
tila the Hun, and the biblical_King
Herod,_he encourage his listeners
to attend the inauguration pro-
tests in Washington, D. C., prom-
ising, “There will not be a quiet
' inaugural. He (Nixon) has flim-
flammed everyone once more.”

Rice said that if he were asked
to give the inaugural invocation
in Washington, “I would pray for
this country because this country
is in trouble. If there is ever to
be a‘ decent country, if there is
ever to be peace again, the power

will rest with the younger genera- I
,R,tion." -

Holland, who served as modera-
tor for the teach-in, started the
speeches with a call for a revision
of the domestic system. “We have
been pleading with our rules these
past years rather than confront-
ing the economic realities.”

She defined the goal of the peace
movement now as ending the war
and- then transforming society so

another Vietnam cannot occur.
Describing the Nixon,administra.-
tion as practioners of racism. op-
pression, and imperialism, Hol-
land applauded the National Lib-
eration Front, the politcal arm of
the Viet Cong, for resisting the
U.S.

“Vietnam was not a unique ac-
cident," Holland said. “It was a
product of U.S. economic, politi-
cal, and social goals for the rest
of the world. We must change the
society, economy, and politics
of America to avoid another Viet-

)7

nam.

Colodny began by considering
the current expectations for a
cease fire by Feb. 3. “If this be
peace, let there be no ceIebrants,”
he declared, sighting the seven
millions tons of bombs that U.S.
planes have dropped on North
Vietnam.

“Whenever we look at Vietnam,
we look into the very soul of this
country. It is America that ,_'lies
in wreckage,” he explained.

Colody traced the history of the
fighting of the Vietnames com-
munists to Ho Chi Minh’s ‘call on
Sept. 19, 1946, to “rise up to
fight" the French colonialists.
“The French and then we made
war againstgthe people,” Colodny
said. “Because it was a war of
the people, out across lines of so-
cial division, we could not win it.”

He then attacked President Nix-
on and “linked foreign policy mis-
takes with domestic policies."
Colodny suggested that Nixon’s
decisions “massacre those who
dissent. Is he (Nixon) notiengaged
in reversing the decision at Appo-
mattox?”

Colodny warned his audience of
the existance of a domestic secret
service and that citizens must
“struggle to guard our own do-
mestic rights. We have a Presi-
dent who leads a‘ frontal assault
on the Bill of Rights and who will

not hesitate to stiffle and oppress

Colodny’s speech was followed .

by long applause.

Landy’s short address consist-
ed of quoting in its entirety a
poem, entitled “To Posterity."
Written in 1938, the verses warn-
ed of political oppression. Landy

concluded with a resolve to “re-
sist a situation that I find intoler-
able."

Next on the speaking agenda
was Hayes, a Vietnam veteran,
who told ofihis experiences there
and the events afterwards which
turned him against the U.S. in-
volvement. He related vivid im-
pressions of death, then turned to
statistics in order to show the ex-
tent of the scars left upon Amer-
ican veterans by the war.

In addition to the 45.000 killed.
Hayes described the “horrors of
Vietnam of those who survived."
Hundreds of thousands of vets suf-
fered casualties. and many of
them remain in Veterans Admin-
istration hospitals. Moreover,
drug addition was prevalent

among U.S. soldiers in Vietnam,

and often the problem returned
home with the veterans.

After his 12-month tour in Viet-
nam, Hayes attended a teach-in at
Pitt in the spring of 1967 and start-
ed to change his mind on the war.
He investigated the history of the
conflict. In October, 1968, he turn-
ed in his medals to Monsignor
Rice at an anti-war demonstra-
tion and made his first public
statement against the war. Then

Hayes began supporting the ef-.

forts of draft evaders.
He said that the peace move-

'ment now must “go beyond public

protest and political action. We
must put the fragments back to-
gether.”

Davis, an undergraduate, out-
lined the history of U.S. involve-
ment in Indochina and domestic
protests against it. She cried that
by the time of the tragedies at
Kent State University and Jack-

son State University in 1970. the
war had become a “distant real-
ity” to most students. She exorted
her fellow Pitt students to be-
come more active‘ in the anti-war
movement. "How much longer
can we betray Kent State? Cn we
risk four more years of silence?"
she demanded.

Montgome traced the history
of the Vietnam protest movement
to a pamphlet published in May,
1950, by French veterans. In his
discussion of U.S. protests, he
noted the change in their intention
and direction ‘since Pitt‘s first
teach—in in 1965. At that session,
Montgomery said that pro-war
speakers participated and that
the anti-war people believed they
could convince the government of
their mistakes by petition.

“Today, to find an answer to
this carnage, this ripping apart of
our society, we must look to our
country,” he said. “The real war
has come home to us; we can
solve it only if we change the
structure of our country.”

/He branded Nixon a dman
and called the Christmastime
bombings of North Vetnam a
Presidential “temper tantrum."

"There is a _sickness in“ this
country which belongs to us all,
and we must root it out. We have
learned a lot since 1965. The bat-
tle must be a daily one,” Mont-
gomery said.

One thing-we learned is the im-
portance of mobilizing every soul
we can reach because it is only
there that we have been able to

stop Nixon there _and that we can

dream of turning ‘around the des-
tinies of the country.

“If peacecomes, the credit be-

longs to the people who were
demonstrating against him (Nix-
on). The society that Nixon rep-
resents made the war. That is why

our war has just begun. We must’

turn this country around so that
we may never againbe blighted
by such a war." ‘

Windt was the final speaker and ' 0

deviated from the dominant
theme of the program to express

his views on the relationships of

the Nixon administration with
Congress, the Supreme Court, the
media, and the people. He called
this the “underlying problem of
the war.” ‘

He described the “unchecked

power now concentrating in the _,

office of the President,” and add-
ed that the problem will continue

no matter who becomes Presi-

dent. Windt expressed “a per-

verse sense of gratitude to Nixon

for showing us this problem.”
Windt mentioned the special

assistants to the President ,—' Ni_x- '_

A Column and a Half

by JOHN ME'I‘CALFE

_ Everyone who had the stomach for it has probably had enough of
the inauguration by now. Those without the stomach would likely rather
not be annoyed with it at this late date. They may be excused.

If anybody is left in between, a few notes on the event.

First a point in Nixon’s favor. I had thought his contempt for~any-
thing that was not RMN was perfect, but it is not. A careful look at
. the television screen showed the flags in Washington all at half-staff in
honor of Truman’s death. Mr. Nixon’s motives may not be entirely
pure; one day he too will be a former president, and eventually he may
a , finally die. After all that, he will expect at least the courtesy of lowered
‘ flags. “
To some of us, it was curiously appropriate for the inauguration to
take place under conditions of official mourning.

CBS did its best to prove administration charges that the network
is biased. It was all right for Senator Kennedy to wince at Nixon’s clum-
sy paraphrase of his brother’s inaugural address. It was biased to show
him doing so. No one expects Dr. Kissinger to go through life without
yawning; it is biased to show him doing so during the address.

Secretary\Rodgers always looks unemployed. Why show him look-
ing useless while the boss outlinesthe next four years of world history?

a _ And it was pointless to show a dozen demonstrators, even if there
were a hundred thousand. Surely a man who plans to ignore the 30 mil-
lion who voted against him will not be swayed by such a small group.

All in all it was a fine, though not surprising, entertainment. If we

.- are not corporations, we are on our own.

_ Though we are told it is silly, a few of us will continue to criticize
Nixon, and his horks, and his pomps. He’s the only President we’ve got.
~. There’s little point in criticizing those who are out of power.

Hang on Dick! As long as you give me a target, I’ll give you some

i A, adversity to bear up nobly under.

  r   Mailing Lists

A recent column in the Pitt News raised an interesting question.

9" one which has disturbed the University community from time to time.

Is the University selling our names to the highest bidder?

_ V It has become a commonplace that each of us, every time it is ne-
1 ‘cessary to fill out a form, may expect to receive junk mail as a conse-

Now’ it seems possible the University is in the business and that

 if each of us, whether student, faculty member, staff member, or casual
 ‘visitor is having his name sold to the highest bidder.

Letters to the Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

In Mr. Zrust‘s article "Wrong-
ness, Liberals, and Maturity" of
January 10. 1973. he tried to pull
himself off as a knowledgeable
judge of political events who rose
above name calling and mud sling-
ing. He claimed that his attackers
were "emotion-charged" who
took their wrath out on him. This
I don't dispute—maybe he has re-
ceived Agnewest treatment. But
now let’s look at his defense, for
in this he should surely rise above
such frivolity.

In the article, Mr. Zrust uses a
selection of words which I suspect
he means to use in a political fash-
ion: young-left, McGovern left,

"pointy-headed” liberals, politi-I,

cally pure, left, liberal, radical
liberal, intelligent liberal, matur-
ity, and our country’s blood.
Please Mr. Zrust, explain — or
don’t you know either. Does any-
one doubt that in recent years, es-
pecially in the context of the past
Presidential campaign that these
words had become emotional. In
Zrust’s analysis McGovern was
both too far ,to the left and
"wrong” for America (whatever
that means). Being far to the left
may be politically unsuccessful,
but wrong. Mr. Zrust, how could
you! '

In one part of the article a ref-
erence was made to democrats

v_ deserting the. “radical Presiden-

tial ticket” so as not to be viewed
as radical liberals. According to
this, Zrust has either fallen into
the emotional habit of using “rad-
ical liberal” to mean liberals who
are “wrong” for America, or he
fails to understand the makeup of
the McGovern campaign and the
ideals“ he expressed, which may
be labeled liberal, but hardly rad-
ical. My feeling is that Mr. Zrust

"may be along with many other

people reacting gutterally, emo-’

tionally, and mayberwith their
flags over their eyes and ears-
but not politically.

Later on there is the appeal to
and gratitude expressed for the
“intelligent liberals.“ This is a
real point of confusion. What is an
“intelligent liberal"? Is an intelli-
gent liberal a “good“ liberal? Are
they “pointy-headed“ or "ma-
ture"? My feeling is that what
Zrust has referred to as an intelli-
gent liberal may not really be
what even he could define as a
liberal. But at least whoever or
whatever they are they’ll have the
comfort of knowing that Zrust ap-
proves of them. I seem to doubt
Mr. Zrust’s delight in seeing the
"intelligent liberals” rebuilt the
democratic party.

Concerning Zrust‘s reference
to the belief of McGovern sup-
porters that they represented
most liberals and Democrats.
Zrust seemed to read too much
into local Democratic victories as
well as the reason for McGov-
ern’s defeat. I suspect that there
is much more to it than the liberal
vs. conservative analysis.

In response to Zrust’s defense
of his maturity he resorts to the
same category of opinionation.
He claims that the black Pitt
News front page as well as the
wearing of buttons, etc. is child-

‘ ish. Apparently he sets himself

up as some sort of “adult” au-

thority. Really Zrust, is the mark
of “maturity” being able to ac-
cept defeat gracefully .(how is it
that you do that anyway)?

Those of us who believe that
the policies of the Nixon admin-
istration have been and will likely
continue to be detrimental to the
U.S. aspire to something much
higher than .mere maturity. By
wearing buttons, etc. there is the
feeling that the administration
will be brought to understand that

‘them with a response? -

despite the landslide victory it
won not all people consent to its
policies and that this’ opposition
will continue to be vocal and vis-
ual. The discontent felt my many
McGovern supporters stems not
from the fact that their candidate
lost the contest for the big prize
or that he lost it by such a big
margin.

There is concern. however. that
the policies of the Nixon "admin-
istration whether popular or not
are detrimental to the welfare of
the U.S. So long as this feeling is
felt there can be no cause to join
in "Hall to the Chief” and forget
the protest. This is not being a
sore loser. It is more on the order
of dedication to a cause. Zrust has
said that the wearing of buttons
and “trinkets” is useless. Ac-
cordingly the displaying of the
flag should be equally as useless.
Let’s see Zrust write an article
calling the flag displayers child-
ish. That minority of people who
continue to wear their buttons.
etc., apparently do not adhere to
the belief that because a major-
ity or even a landslide has ap-
proved something that it is neces-
sarily correct.

Please Zrust, if you wish to re-
act to or attack the McGovern
supporters do not attack us on the
grounds of maturity of political
activity, innuendoes and labels. If
you want to show yourself as, a
political analyst, then argue po-
licy and stance, not something as
nebulous as labels——especially the
ill defined ones you’ve used.

If you really were so much
above the scathing rebuttals you
received and if they were that
childish, then why did you gratify

Rhetoric Is   Dead

by RALPH DEAN

“When Demosthenes was asked
what was the first part of ofatory,
he answered, ‘Action’; and which
was the second, he replied,"Ac-
tion’; and which was the third, he

still answered, ‘Action.”’

—P|utarch

It wasn’t much of a speech, was
it? The inaugural address, Imean.
Oh the text didn’t seem bad, es-
pecially to those who still thrill to
the Protestant ethic, but the de-
livery was dreadful. The Presi-
dent seemed almost apologetic
throughout, and displayed none of
the power that a man in his posi-
tion holds. One could see the cau-
tious manner with which he de-
livered the rephrase of John Ken-
neddy’s 1061 quotation. Any self-
respecting used car salesman
could have delivered the same
speech and had the applause echo-
ing from Washington’s monu-
merit.

This raises an interesting ques-
tion. Where have all the great ora-

. tors gone? What has happened to

is simply the_nature of the times
we live in. They’re cool, baby.
People don’t get enthused over
«anything anybody has to say. Po-
.liticians can’t even get enthused
about what they themselves have
to say. About a year ago Ed Mus-
kie was moved to tears in a public
reply to some nearly libelous
news stories and was branded a
cry baby, and unstale. George
Romney was wiped out politically
four years ago when he used a lit-
tle hyperbole in his famous
“brainwashed” speech. One hun-

- dred years ago they would have

loved it.

The other obvious reason is
television. The “cool” medium.
One must exercise restraint on
the tube or come across like a po-
litical Paul Lynde. Can you imag-
ine William Jennings Bryan giving
his famous “Cross of a Gold”

speech on TV. It would be hilari-
ous.

All of this means a change in
the type of man who now rises to
the top of the political. world. The
hypnotists who could ywrap a
crowd around their little finger,
the Roosevelts and Churchills are
gone, replaced by the McGoverns
and the Nixons, who could main-
tain their outercalmness if their
coats were on fire. They are able
to make a basset hound look like
it has hypertension by compari-
son.

One could argue whether this is

Today’s politicians may be dread-
ful bores, but the man who said,
“I know that one is able to win
people far more by the spoken
than by the written word” wasn’t
exactly my idea of a statesman
either.

Tosca qWrought with
Romantic Stickiness

by ANDREW-J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

The romantic stickiness pro-
duced by the syrup which flowed
from Giacomo Puccini’s pen was
evident in this past weeks Pitts-
burgh Opera production of Tosca
at Heinz Hall. Likewise, there
was many a sticky moment during
the course of the evening, pro-
duced not by the score but by the
artists involved. -

And when we speak of stickiness
in this regard, we mean, quite
frankly, that there were many
musical instances that did not
come off as well as one may have
hoped.

Evelyn Lear is not a Tosca in
the tradition of Nilsson and Price;
that was evident from her
screeches during the course of the
musical action. Having little
sense of control over her voice

‘she punched at most high notes

.’

i_’_f'

and left us without any, real sense
of feeling for Floria Tosca’s char-
acter.

Needless to say, she is an ac-
tress of some repute on the stage.
Her acting during the scene with-
in Scarpials apartment was a vir-
tual tour de force, unfortunately.
her singing was not. Where Lear
has succeeded in the 20th centruy
opera of Berg and Bartok, she has
"struck out” in regard to Puccini.

Thomas Stewart’s Scarpia, al-
though diabolical to the nth de-
gree, was very often devoid of mu-
sicality. His range was tarnished
by muddy tones, and he very often
swallowed his notes.

Tenor William Johns as .Cavar-
adossi, receives the laurels for
the evening’s best performance,
however. Virtually unknown to
this listener, Johns proved him-
self to have a tenorial purity and

” lightness. which have not been

heard around this city in some
time. Dr. Karp struck gold when
he assigned Johns to this role,
and we can certainly be grateful
for his foresight. '

The duets shared by Lear and
Johns were little more than av-
erage throught most of the opera.
But their duet in Act II, rang so
true that we must confest it to be
the virtual highpoint of the eve-
ning.

The name of Napoleon Bisson
must also be added to the “plus"
column for his role as the sumb-
ling sacristan of Act I. Bringing
a knowledgable sense of humor to
his role, he garnered many a
chuckle. from the audience. An
honorable mention also goes to
boy soprano Daniel Day for his
portrayal of the shepherd boy.

Not surprisingly, the Pittsburgh
Opera Chorus produced its usual
mediocre attempts. The stickiest
and most problematic moment of
the evening had to be the Te Deum
scene at the conclusion of Act I.
Dr. Karp swung his arms wildly,
but alas, to no avail—the.chorus
was not with the orchestra until
the concluding notes. Luckily
enough, the chorus plays no large
role in this work -and we were
spared further choral errors fol-
lowing this scene.

Act I’s scenery must certainly
receive the uncoveted award for
the tackiest set of the season.
Supposedly portraying the Church
of Sant Andrea della Valle, the set
dependended upon the crudest ma-
terials imaginable and also the
worst art work. We could hardly
help but notice that Cadvarados-
si’s unfinished painting was hard-
ly the sort we would expect paint-
ed in the Home of 1800; quite
frankly, it appeared to be a pur-
loined El Greco.

Some of the special effects- were
noteworthy. The approach of
dawn at the beginning of Act III,
with its somewhat abrupt disap-
pearance of stars, pleased the au-
dience (which usually goes wild
over special lighting effects).

/In the final analysis, this pro-
duction was a mediocre, middle-
of-the-road attempts. No truly
glorious moments here, only the
usual operatic production which
Pittsburgh has learned to grin
and bear. ’

Discussions on revising the for-
mat of the Undergraduate Re-
view highlighted CAS Cabinet

meetingheld last Thursday night. -

According to Mary Szvetecz, as-
sistant editor of the Review, the
present policy has been to allow
each professor the option of hav-
ing his course evalation printed
or not.

One proposal would allow a pro-
fessor the option of haing his class
evaluated. If the professor refuses
evaluation the fact would be noted
in the UAR. After evaluation, the
professor wouldbe given the op-
tion to look over the review and
state reasons whyythe evaluation
was inaccurate. These statements
would also appear in the UAR.

John Capitman, member of the
CAS Council, submitted a second
proposal that all courses be eval-
uated and then the "professor be

given three options: 1) the eval——

uation be presented as it; 2) the
evaluation be published with the
professor’s comments, and 3)
the evaluation be vetoed by the
professor and this would be noted
in the UAR.

The two policies will be intro-
duced as alternate plans at the
next Faculty of Arts and Sciences
meeting.

Unclergroicluciie Review

In other business, the Cabinet
listened to a complaint from
Michael Meyer, a student at the
University, on a specific require-
ment for Psychology 80 course.

Meyer stated thathe objected
to the fact that students were re-
quired to spend four hours as
“guinea pigs” in experiments for
the Psychology Department. He
added, it was a "non-ethical and
crude way to dig up fodder for
graduate students.”

Some speculation was made as
to whether this policy had been re-
vised for the current semester,
and Ron Eskin, chairman of the
CAS Cabinet, promised to meet

. with the chairman of the Psychol-

ogy Department to discuss the
problem.

possibilities for financing the pay-

from the student activities fee.
She said her committee investi-
gated other possibilities, such as
University funds or scholarships,

and found that they were not avail- -

able. Her recommendation was to
use the activities fee.

Board members Dave Bluey
and Terry Sadler opposed the us-
age of such funds, saying that
there were ways to avoid using
them.

“The Dean is covering your
eyes.“ Bluey retorted when Weav-
er said she had checked Dean
Moye’s office on the possibility of
University scholarships for those
involved in time-consuming stu-

dent activities. *- ' '

 ; As it turned out Saturday, Pitt‘s
wrestling team probably should
have stayed at home, as the Pan-

bypowerful Lehigh, 21-9, at the
‘Field House.

For the Cats, it was a case of
jfmight have been." Pitt had
chances for an upset, three big
ones in the 158, 167, and 177 pound
classes. In all three matches Pan-
ther wrestlers were beaten late
in the third period, costing them
a possible nine team points.

the cagers shooting percentage
from the floor in the first half was
an impressive .551. And by the end
of the half the Pitt squad had ac-
cumulated a 40-27 lead over its
opponents.

The scoring power of the Pan-
thers did not cool off in the second
half as they continued to shoot
above ‘.500. On the other hand the
St. Francis hoopsters were only
able to average .300 in the first
half and a .329 percentage in the
second half of play.

With a constant stream of sub-
stitutes going in and out of the
game for Pitt. many Panthers
were given the opportunity to
score in the double figures.

Freshmen Tom Richards prov-

ed to be the real scrambler for
the Panthers as-he sparked the

team with his 24 points, the high-

est by" any player in’ the game.
Richards grabbed 12 of these
points in the first half to help se-
cure a solid lead for the Pitt team.

The Panthers’ top scorer, Billy
Knight, ran second to Richards
against St. Francis. The star cag-
er collected a total of 18 points
and 12 rebounds on the evening.

The meet had started well for
Pitt, as little Dave DeMarino shut
out Tom Hirsch. 7-0. DeMarino
racked up his first win in four
tries and primed the Panther fans
to the possibility of an upset.

' George “Fuddy” Bryant lost to
Lehigh’s freshman All-American
‘candidate Mike Frick at 126.
Frick looked quick and strong, but
Bryant made him work for his
points. "

Bob Beck’ and Ron Selfridge
were beaten at 134 and 142, re-
spectively, by the other two mem-
bers of Lehigh’s squad, Tom Scul-
ly and Kim Hogedorn.

Still, Pitt hada shot at the up-
set after John Buzzat0's 4-0 shut-
out of last year’s PIAA champ
Dan Santoro, in the 150 pound
class. The team score at the time
was 9-6, with Chatman up.

But Lehigh swept four of the
last five matches, with only Craig
Tritch gaining a win. 7-3. over
Paul Farsetta.

The loss dropped the Cats‘ rec-
ord to a dismal 2-4, with their
next performance being at the
Field House Wednesday against
WVU. Lehigh upped its mark to
8-4. with all four losses to top 10
schools.

’ Sports ‘Shorts

Co-ed intramural swimming
season is just around the corner
and the planned competition
events promise to offer all parti-

_cipants a maximum of challenge

while assuring a maximum of fun.

The rules are simple. Each

team must consist of eight mem-

bers—four girls and four boys.
(Any team not composed as such
will be counted as a forfeit.) The
time during which competitions
will take place is 6:30 p.m. to 8
p.m. every weekday night.

The meets will consist of four

fun relays: inner tube relay, un-
derwear relay. umbrella relay.

freshman Keith Starr also pro-
vided ample support for the Cats.
scoring 14 and eight points. re-
spectively.

While the Cats may have had a
little difficulty getting insideon
St. Francis early in the first half.
the Frankies found it impossible
to penetrate the Pitt defense until
a few minutes before the end of
the first half.

“They (St. Francis) had to de-
pend on the outside shots because
we were hitting so well,” com-
mented Pitt’s head basketball
coach Buzz Ridl on his squad’s
effective defensing of the
Frankies.

St. Francis’ head coach Dick’

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.-Just ask the Pitt
Hockey Club what the sweetest thing in the world is
and they'll reply instantly and unanimously——re-
venge. The Pitt skaters reaped ‘revenge on Penn
State by completely outskating the Lions enroute to
a 6-1 victory Saturday on the loster’s home ice.

Last season. Penn State dealt the skaters a
pair of defeats and the Pitt players talked of noth-
ing but avenging_ those losses on the bus ride to
State College. Pitt took the ice psyched higher than
they ever have been before and proceeded to play
their finest team effort of the season.

No single star could be picked out from the Pitt
lineup, but goaltender Mark Lieberman came up
with his finest game. Lieberman turned away 28 of
29 shots and made several key stops to keep his
team in the lead. .

Penn State came out like gangbusters and for

- the first part of the initial period, it looked like Pitt

was in for a hectic afternoon. Playing under NCAA
rules, without -a red line, Penn State used the fami-
liarility of the their home rink to apply some early
pressure in the Pitt.end. - I

The Pittdefense held the attack off long enough
for the offense to get going. Denny_Browne, recover-
ing from the flu, tallied the initial goal of the con-

,test midway through the first period.

Second vline center Dave Bahnson, just off a
two game-two hat trick scoring spree, put Pitt
ahead to stay late in the first period. The Pitt de-
fense and Lieberman held Penn State off the score-
board in the first period as play went from end to
end.

Pitt’s third goal came on a beautiful setup by .

Rich Baginski. Taking a hard check along the left
wing boards, Baglinski fed a picture perfect pass to
Tom Lang, who was cruising in on the right side of
the crease. Lang merely tapped the pass by John
Stoken, the Penn State netminder. '

Penn State battled back with their only goal of
the contest midway through the second period. Tom
Oleksa wound up and fired a blazing slapshot from
25 foot out that beat Lieberman along the ice on his
glove side.

and ping-pong relay. There are
two games per meet, the tug-of-
war and water polo.

at the Intramural Office at Trees

Joe Testa made his debut for Pitt at the center
slot and netted a goal for his efforts. Testa usually
could be found at the blue but roamed too much from
his position. Coach"Tom Myers suggested that Testa
try himself at a forward’s spot and Testa seems to
like his new home. ‘

By the third period Penn State had to replace
Stoken with backup goalie Bob Kuvinka. The Pitt
shooters showed no preference for either netmind-
er. In all, Pitt outshot Penn State by 11152-29 margin.

Phil Clarke banged in the rebound of a Billy
Glanville shot to provide Pitt with a comfortable
lead. Glanville’s shot was from an extremely-sharp
angle but the rebound lay in the crease undisturbed
for Clarke. ‘

Glanville put the finishing touches on the game
with the final score. Glanville’s goal gave each
member of the first line, the “lush line," a tally
for the afternoon. -

The scheduled game between Pittand Penn
State on Feb. 3 at the Civic Arena has been can-
celled. Pitt will 'continue their exhibition schedule
next Saturday against Navy at the Alpine Ice Chalet.

More Rules

POINT CLEAR, "Ala. (AP) -
The National Collegiate Athletic
Association’s Football Rules
Committee voted Friday to per-
mit unlimited substitution when
the ball is dead, and also approved
a modification of the fair catch
rule.

The 16 voting members of the
committee approved 14 changes,
including a number of minor revi-
sions, which will be placed in ef-
fect for the'1973 season.

Committee Chairman John Wal-
dorf of Kansas City, Mo., and
commissioner of officials for the
Big Eight, said the changes ap-
proved were all non-controver-
sial. He: added, however, “I be-
lieve these rules will have some
impact on the game of football.

Waldorf and. Committee Secre-
tary Davey Nelson, University of
Delaware athletic director, ex-
plained the changes during a news
conference at the close of a three-

,, day session of the group.

The fair catch rule revision re-
quires. Waldorf said. that the
player so signaling must raise his
arm over his head and wave it
from one side to the other at least
one time. ,

He said this would force the re-
ceiver to make his fair catch sig-
nal a little earlierithan if he mere-
ly raised his arm as required in
the past. Failure of the receiver
to make the side to side motion
with his hand would result in a 15-
yard penalty.

The free substitution change
will permit a coach to send in any
number‘ of eligible substitutes
when the ball is dead, and offi-
cials will not be required to re-

cord who the subs are.‘

Previously. only two changes
were permitted when the ball is
dead. except on a change of pos-
session. .

Waldorf said the change would
be of considerable advantage to
teams with more limited squads.
He said it would also result in the
easing of limitationson athletic
scholarships voted on by the
NCAA at its annual meeting in
Chicago early last week.

The new NCAA rule requires _

that only 30 new football scholar-
ships can be awarded per year,
with an over-all limit of 105.
Many major conferences have an
over-all limit of 120 or more.

The rules committee voted to
set up a six—foot area on the side-
lines in front of each team area
and players and coaches would be
required to stay in back of that
clear area.

Waldorf and Nelson said the
changewas made in an effort to
keep the sidelines clear. No pen-
alty would be charged, but offi-
cials could stop the game and re-
quest that coaches and players
move back from the clear area.

The committee also banned the
use of non-theraputic drugs—non-
healing drugs—before or during a
game as “not in keeping within
the aims of amateur athletics.
