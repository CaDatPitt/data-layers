Kent Finds Nlcn Emotional  
But Pittitcs A ren ’t Worried

Are girls _less emotional than
men?

In a recent experiment conduct-
ed by Kent University Psychology
club members on a woman and man
student, they found out that this
was the case.

Using respiration, blood pressure,
and electrical changes of the skin
as measurements, the students were
tested as to their reactions to dif-
ferent types of music. Music rang-
ing from Artie Sh:J.w’s “Night
Ride” to a Debussy funeral march
were played, and the reaction of
the “guinea pigs” recorded.

ment was reliable enough to merit
serious consideration. In surveys,
she continued, the difference be-
tween the media of the different
sexes is always smaller than the
differences between the lowest and
greatest tendencies of each sepa-
rate sex. However as yet no one
deﬁnitely knows which of the sexes
is more or less emotional.

Dr. George Jones, professor of
psychology, said that in surveys
which can be found in reliable
psychology books the tendency
seems to be in line with those
found at Kent university.

Insufficient data to comment up-
on was the reaction of Dr. J. S.
Gray, assistant professor of psy-
chology, while Dr. A. G. Dietze,

Tentative ‘Faced-=Lifting’ Plan

For SFA Being Circulated 

By S. F. Ayers

A revolutionary plan for student
government at Pitt is being circu-
lated this week by David Tucker,
C41, vice president of the Student-
Faculty association. It is not in
deﬁnite shape yet and is only being
circulated as a trial balloon to check
the drift of student attitude to-
wards student government or the
lack of it.

The basis of the plan is the set-
ting-up of a new organ of govern-
ment representative of activities
rather than of the students them-
selves. A cabinet of about 12 or
14 members would be the central
governing body, and at the most
four members would be elected by
the student body at large.

The philosophy behind the plan
is simple. Certain members of SFA
and other activities feel that the
present electoral system is not very
good. They propose to remedy it
by placing control of student gov-
ernment in the hands of repre-
sentzxtives of activities, declaring
‘bat. the only ones who do any vot-
ing or are interested in government
are the students who participate
in activities.

Representatives would be select-
ed irom the publications, dramatic.
forensic, and musical groups, the
YIVICA, the YWCA, WSGA, WAA,
and the like. These represent..-
tives would constitute the cabinet
of the new governing body, along
with four students elected. at larﬁe

Board Seats Thirteen Nominees;
27,000 Graduates to Name Others

By Fred Lange

The lioarrl of 'l.‘rustces ofﬁcially approved a plan for alumni
.2-epreseiitz-ltion and elected 13 a.lu1nni-noniinees to Board rnen:1be1'-
ship l*‘rir_lay, ending a prolonged controversy between the Geiieral
Alumni association and the Board over the election. of 21lllllllll—
trustees.

Subinitted by a co1n1nitt_ee composed of Board members and
alumni, the plan previously was adopted by the Alumni council. Both
alumni and Board representatives agrees that the measure was a com-
promise, not a victory for either side.

Formerly the alumni contended that 15 members of the Board should
be elected by the association, according to a provision of the plan pro-
posed by Governor George H. Earle in 1937.

University officials asserted that such an arrangement conﬂicted
with the University charter, and
negotiatioons between the alumni
and university continued without
success until the approval of the
present plan.

According to the adopted plan, the
alumni are entitled to ten members
on the Board, three of whom will
be elected in alternate election
years, and four in intermediate
elections.

All persons who hold degrees in
course may vote for alumni-trust-
ees. Members of the Alumni asso-
ciation who do not have University
degrees are also entitled to vote.
The electorate will include approxi-
mately 27,000.

Each school alumni group will
submit a nominee for election and
the total number of nominees will
exceed the number of vacanies,
eliminating any possibility of “nom-
inations” tantamount to election.

Because of two vacancies caused
by death and change of Governor

University Will Offer
Course in Meteorology

Next semester the University will
offer a course in the elements of
meteorology. This will be the ﬁrst
time that such a course has been
given, announces Donald C. Brad-
ford, University seismologist.

Students taking meteorology will
study humidity, wind forces and
structure, precipitation, solar radi-
ation, forecasting, and climate. The
course will carry two credits, and
there will be no laboratory. No
pre requisites will be required, and
the subject will be open to every-
one.

Service association of Pittsburgh
advised.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
Men’s Student Health service and
Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, director of
the Women’s Health service, have
enthusiastically endorsed the pro-
gram, sponsored jointly by the Pitt
News and the Student Health serv-
ice. They urge all students to take
advantage of the plan.

Although ﬁgures are not availa-
ble on the number of students who
were hospitalized during the ﬁrst
semester, the Health service reports
that many students were given free
medical attention under the plan.

Twenty-ﬁve local hospitals are
members of the program. The stu-
dent may be admitted to any one of
them upon the approval of Dr.
Carlson.

Dr. Jamison, discussing this phase
of the plan recently, said, “There
are students who believe that they
must receive the certiﬁcation of
their family physician in order to
receive hospitalization. This is not
correct. A studentcneed only have
the approval of the Health service.”

The hospitalization plan, now in
its second year on the campus, is
the first of its kind ever conducted
by a college or university. It has
become increasingly popular as its
beneﬁts have become known.

The Third Tel‘!!!
And [IR 1776

THE PRESIDENT of the United States of
America will be inaugurated in Washington to-
day. And. he will be crowned as soon as HR 1776
is passed under the pressure of the hysteria of
“National Defense.”

It is an interesting sign of democratic pro-
cedure that the majority of the people of the
United States el.ect a single man to serve for
three terms. It is a sign of grat sagacity that
the democratic peoples recognize a strong man
and continue to use him.

But the president has asked for extraordinary
powers in managing the national defense of our
country. And he has not asked that these pow-
ers be limited, or that they be clariﬁed to any
great extent. And many people feel that a dem-
ocratic president would never want such wide
and unclariﬁed powers.

The president says that a great emergency
faces the country. And these powers, unclari-
ﬁed and implied, are necessary for a strong de-
fense of America.

Now we believe the president, of course.
What we don’t do is trust him. Way back in
1917 there were some 100,000,000 people in the
U. S. alone who believed a liberal president.
Of course it was ﬁne to believe him. But they
trusted him too.

It’s Criminal

Do you like Gammon’s waffles‘?
My name isn’t wafﬁes.

That was on the last test.

Have a test.

No thanks, just had one.

Are you sure?

I’m positive.

I don’t think criminals should be
punished. After all, if a man’s a
criminal, he has something in his
makeup that makes him a criminal,
and therefore there is nothing he
can do about it.

Then you’ve got to look at it from
a functional standpoint. You must
say. This man has criminal makeup
and therefore he can’t do anything
about it. Then you eliminate the
criminal, gently muttering, This
won’t hurt a bit chappie, but so---
ciety has a makeup, too, that says
you are on the detrimental side and
it is to the best advantage of the
group that you be dispensed with.

This Could Happen To You, But

By the Anti-Elevator Editor

There were 43 of us in the ele-
vator,

The operator said, “Step back in
the car please.”

The door started to close, but
thought better of it.

The door said, “Step back in the
car, please.” There was a slight
nasal twang to the command.

Somebody on the ﬂoor said, “I
can’t move an inch.”

Another voice on thet ﬂoor came
back, “Y’oughta get some more ex-
ercise.” Gag.

The dispatch box thundered out,

“Step back in the car, please,
you . . .”
The back wall of the elevator
fell through, the door shut violent-
ly, and a janitor was called to sweep
up the three arms, and a complete
shoulder—arm clutching a book on
American Government, Poli Sci 1.
I‘ remember distinctly the complete
shoulder. It was mine.

“Floor, please,” muttered the op-
erator.

What was ieit of a short black
haired girl indicated that she would
like to get oil‘ at five by raising her

forces.)

There was the great mistake.
Never trust a man you believe.

(Expeditionary

And most important, the young men and wo-

men of America want to know what’s going on
now, and what will go on. And they want to
know why. Because the last time they trusted
a man in a crisis as great as the present one,
they were thoroughly raked over the coals.

The young men of the U. S. are going to be
the ones who are going to do the killing in this
next war and the getting killed. And so they’re
the ones who have the say so as to whether they

want this little job.

Today is Pittsburgh’s National unity day.
Let’s all unite and think this out. Thinking is a
lot easier than following the leader if you have

to march to Europe.

Foreign Policy Group Gives ‘Balance Sheet’ 

Survey of U. S. Aid to Embattled Engl and A”

. From Army stocks: 970,000
riﬂes; 80,000 machine guns; 800
75-mm ﬁeld guns; 12,000,000
rounds of ammunition; 240 at-
tack and dive bombers; mostly
obsolete; 229 World war model
light tanks, (to Canada); 250,000
revolvers; 18 million pounds of
TNT. Exports of current Amer-
ican plane production, from Sep-
tember to 1939 to last November:
1,912 planes went to England,
Canada and the Empire (out of
an export total of 3,669 planes).

From the beginning of the war
to January 1, 1941, 175 merchant
vessels with a gross tonnage of
532,000 tons were transferred to
Britain and Canada (mostly old
ships). Fifty overage World war
model destroyers were traded in
the well known naval base deal
of last September.

This is the total revealed
amount of American aid to Brit-
ain during the ﬁrst 16 months of
the second World war.

Taking full account of the bal-

ance sheets to the right and left,

the Foreign Policy association fol-
lows through by pointing out below
what the U. S. can do to aid Bri-
tain more.

“Short of direct participation in
the war,” the following innovations
are suggested, and the respective
risks involved in each action are
noted:

More effective mobilization of the
American peacetime war. effort:
(1) Better coordination and more
efficient direction —- super-defense
commission; (2) Fuller inventories
——such as the shocking Philip Mur-
ray steel surveys; (3) compulsory
priority for British and U. S. Army
orders—not now in effect.

Allocate a larger share of Amer-
ican production for direct delivery
to Britain—e. g., while the U. S.
gets most of the training planes
that are built, at present 80% of
all combat planes go to Britain.

Standardize mass production on
a small number of plane models
and set up a Director of Aircraft
Production. Mobilize ‘auto indus-
try for plane production.‘ Under
the present set-up, American aid
for Britain in all ﬁelds will 11013 13¢?-

With the increasing tempo in the
development by the president and
congress of a deﬁnite war policy, a
summarization of United States aid
to Britain is most instructive as
factual information upon which stu-
dents can rationally interpret their
own opinion, as well as attempt to
keep abreast of the headlines.

The material for this article was
revealed in the report of the For-
eign Policy association (New York)
for January 1, 1941.

The boa: to the left contains the
answer to the question, What have

and difficulties are involved?

the war.

Construct merchant vessels for
British account; sell boats to Bri-
tain; seize idle foreign tonnage in
U. S. ports for the beneﬁt of the
British—l00 vessels in all, half
Danish; form shipping pool under
which U. S. boats could relieve
British ships in the Paciﬁc for duty
in Atlantic convoys.

Transfer additional destroyers
(the U. S. now has 160 aﬂoat, 200
projected). Difficulty is lack of Brit-
ish crews. Send torpedo boats and
motor submarine Chasers held up
by Congress last June. Utilize
Pan-American neutrality patrol to
insist on freedom of the seas, as
laid down in the President’s Colum-
bus day address—-thus extending
the patrol to rid the seas of German
submarines and raiders; or use
American warcraft as convoy es-
corts, by extending the neutrality
patrol to the mid—Atlantic, or to Ire-
land. The American Atlantic pa-
trol has 125 ships. Such a move
“entails serious risk of battle with
German warcraft, and hence of in-
volvement in the conﬂict. Yet both
sides, having little to gain by formal
hostilities, might conceivably give
tacit sanction to a status of quasi-
belligerency . . .”

that it had nothing to say for pub-
lication.

The elevator operator said, “I’m

reality it only fell two inches. Those

Tucker’s plan represents the be-
ginning of the work of the SFA
constitution revision committee,
which he heads. He has pointed
out that it is only his own idea for
student government taken from the
forms of government established at
other colleges and universities.

One evening last week Tucker de-
tailed the plan to a small group of
fraternity men who had shown an
interest in his ideas. It is stated
that several leading fraternity men
in SFA have given their support to
this tentative frame of government.

Tucker continues to ask for sug-
gestioiis from the student body on
the type of an association they wish
for the handling of student govern-
ment problems, claiming that work
is still i.n a tentative and indeﬁnite
stage.

Some ineasure of control of the
cabinet over activities which elect
representatives to it is planned.
This stage of the system has not
been fully developed yet and work
is still under way to perfect that
item, among others.

Perfect Records in Jeopardy

Invade Stadium

On Wednesday

Pitt’-s senior ﬁve will be out for
revenge when Waynesburgs Yellow
Jackets invade the Stadium court
Wednesday night. Playing the
Jackets for the first time since 1929,
the hot-and-cold Panthers were
~..u1.';orised last year by the decisive
count at 41-28.

'«Vaynesburg‘s coach Frank Wolf
has put together another of the
smart basketball teams that have
borne his stamp for the past 12
years. Despite the loss of Bob Sim-
mers, who scored 335 points last
year to establish a school scoring
rec-oi'cl. the Yellow Jackets have
copped five out of their first eight
:9tai‘ts in this campaign.

lv‘1'cKeesp:>i.'t products Jack Bcislci'
and Diamond Jim Brady, veteran
.<:pee-::l..=;tcr J'e.cl<. Byer, big Johnny
C1'JLllSOll, and freshman ﬂash Marky
1\/lclocchi make up the ﬁrst ﬁve. Al-
W‘:1§/‘S a great money player, Brady
has s:leveloped into a consistently
bi‘illiant shotmaker. Beislcr is rated
one of the smartest basketball play-
ers in the district.

But though their ﬁve and three
record almost matches Pitt’s, the
Waynesburg quintet hasn’t faced
the same kind of competition that
has forced Pitt to ﬁght for every
victory. St. Vincent and West Lib-
erty are not Illinois and Penn State.

Fired by the spirit of revenge
and rapidly gaining valuable expe-
rience, Doc Carlson’s passers will
be good bets to turn in their seventh
win of the season in their last home
stand until February 11, when West
Virginia’s Mountaineers come to
the Stadium. Between these two
home offerings, the Panthers will
journey to Durham and West Point
during vacation to meet Duke and
Army.

In a fast—movii*.-g, lowv-scoring
game Thursday the sophomore vol-
leyball team edged out the fresh-

been a double elimination tourna-

other chance at the title this being
their first loss.

On Wednesday, at 3:30 o’clock in
the Cathedral gym, the ﬁnal and de-

tween the two teams.

Otey Composes Five

Male Choir Selections

Dr. Wendell Otey, instructor in
music appreciation, has just pub-
lished a group of ﬁve compositions
for male choir. These compositions
are based on folk songs of the Ken-
tucky region and were composed
at the request of Theodore M. Fin-
ney. associate professor and head
of the department of music appre-
ciation.

The ﬁrst piece, “Lady Isabelle
and the Elf Knight,” is dedicated
to Finney, another to the Univer-
sity Glee club, while a third is
dedicated to David S. Mclntosh to
whom Dr. Otey is indebted for the
original collection of folk songs.

there will be a two week layoff
because of exams, recess, and reg-

completing arrangements with their
opponents and then notifying the

Sammies and the Phi Gains, both of
whc.n1 are undefeated. Led by

The Sports Staff

Sp(?(lhS.' Now is the Time . . .

by Vince Matera

When Pitt athletic authorities
voluntarily put themselves under
the guidance of Major Griffith and
his Big Ten rules in 1939, they put
freshman sports in a precarious po-
sition.

Big Ten rules forbid freshman in-
tercollegiate competition on the
grounds that it is too much of a
burden to the men who must take
trips. This rule automatically
caused an abrupt cessation of fresh-
man competition here and left
various and sundry coaches with
the formidable question of what to
do with their ﬁrst year Granges,
Ruths, etc.

Basketball took this stumbling
block in its stride and immediately
made plans for its frosh. Drs.
Carlson and Zehfuss ﬁrst originated
the idea of placing teams into regu-
lar intramural competition.

This overt act immediately caused
an epidemic of hemorrhages among
the ranks of less capable intramural
aspirants. Public opinion being
what it is, the doctors realized that
they should, as it were, take their
dishes and go play in their own
back yard.

And they did. With great alacrity,
Dr. Zehfuss set up a six team
league with the most likely men at

the helm in each team. The suc-
cess of this league probably over-
whelmed even Zehfuss and Carl-
son.

They played ball far exceeding
the best one can see in intramural
struggles, improved as the season
ran on, and ended with a bang-up
double elimination series for the
championship.

This year while Dr. Zehfuss was
peacefully planning the second an-
nual league, the army stepped in
and caused a change of mind on his
part.

Still the plight of the freshmen
didn’t look so bad. Zehfuss’ duties
were put into the capable hands of
football trainer Howard Waite, who
expected to duplicate Zehfuss’ suc-
cess.

But, and now we come to the
point of this long winded discourse,
what has become of the spirit that
pervaded the 40 young gentlemen
who made up the pioneer league?

To date only 18 youths have pre-
sented themselves to Waite, and
many of these are there because
they are aspiring for varsity posi-
tions. Now by no stretching of the
imagination can anyone conceive of
an 18-man league.

Surely there are more than a

dozen and a half freshmen who like
to play basketball, and a desire to
play is the only pre-requisite to en-
trance.

So there’s the challenge, class of
’44. Are you going to let those
sophomores say you weren’t good
enough to take on where they left
off or are you going to beat them at
their own game?

When we count the noses at the
stadium today at 4:30 oclock, we’ll
know.

joined the also-ran group. Led by
Jack Glenn and Joe Connell, the
Phi Kaps have thus far successfully
defended their championship and
look like a good bet to keep it after
the curtain has been rung down on
the current campaign,

The tilt between the Phi Eps and
the PiKA ﬁve should be one of the
better games of the evening despite
the fact that neither team is going
anywhere in the race for the crown.
Tiiese two teams are pretty equally
balanced and with the addition of a
star or two they could easily be-
Come Championship outﬁts.

The Pilam-Kappa Sig affair is
another instance of two teams just
playing out the schedule, as are the
gain.es between the Phi Delts and
E>A_E, and Lambda Chi and Theta
Chi. However, all of these teams
 capable of making life miserable
for the leaders by scoring an upset
win over them. Although it isn‘t
very probable that it will happen,
its a possibility.

Tonight the independents and en-
gineers will again attempt to get
going. They still haven’t played
enough games to really be correctly
analyzed.

Dr. Cleven Claims Danger

Comes to Hemisphere

From Economic Pacts

“Because of the recent Russo-
German economic alliances,” Dr. N.
Andrew N. Cleven, professor of his-
tory, explained to the General A1-
umni association sponsored forum
in Foster Memorial last Friday
evening that “the danger of the to-
talitarian dictators is increasing
from day to day and as a result our
present national defense program
must make our country the arsenal
of democracy.”

In speaking of the possibility of
political solidarity in the western
hemisphere, Dr. Cleven declared
that our main fault lay in our habit
of thinking of the welfare of the
peoples of the western hemisphere
as our peculiar concern and that
our “big brother” attitude is the
most dangerous.

“We still boast about our great
"wealth, our great and powerful po-
sition as a nation and our benevo-
lent intentions towards the smaller
and weaker nations. of the Amer--
ica,” he declared, “and it has about
it the same old acid of our apparent
superiority over other nations.”

Dr. Cleven believes that nothing
is more galling to the American of
Latin America than just this way
of doing things in which they are
concerned and “such conduct on our
part and more especially on the
part of our government will go a
long way to remove some of the
gilt edge from the Good Neighbor
policy.”

Exploitation of the natural re-
sourcesand hidden wealth of the
Latin Americas is included on the
list of hindrances for solidarity and
Dr. Cleven said that “avaricious-

with the anticipation that the.
“di’cermined status of the Western
Hemisphere will no doubt be an
important factor in the course of in-

Bar association is conducting a na-
tion-wide contest, the subject of
which is the “Prospective Develop-
ment of International Law in the

Those eligible to. participate in
the contest are members in good

ciation. ’ ,

ness has been a potent factor in
keeping them apart in the past and
may be counted upon to do so in
the future.”

Singling out the peoples of Span-
ish America as an example, Dr.

Cleven pointed out that they are
not inferior to us and in many ways
their culture and civilization are
superior to ours. “The art of liv-
ing is not summed up in a mania
for the accumulation of material
wealth, but rather in having leisure
time in which to actually live.”
“Fortunately Spain and Spanish
America bot.h produced thinkers
capable of analysing the human
element among their own people
and they have sought the cause for
the unsatisfactory role which the
Spanish people have played in hu-
man affairs for the last several cen-
turies,” explained Dr. Cleven.

“The thinkers whom I have
chosen to present some of the more
important results of their investiga-
tions are not to be looked upon as
mere whining destructive critics.
They are men whose loyal.ty to and
unswerving faith in the Spanish
race is unquestioned. They are
proud of the race to which they be-
long, they believe in the latest
genuine ability of that race. They
go about the introspective process
in a most searching manner, with
hammer and tongs, calling a spade
a spade. A spade a spade.”

Spaniards of the new worl.d have
also produced thinkers like Dr.
Manuel Ugarte of Argentina, who
is one of the most brilliant think-
ers of Spanish America. Dr. Cleven
explained that many of the people
who do not understand Dr. Ugarte
consider him an irrationalist and
unsound in his conclusions.

But regardless of hindering fac-
tors social revolution may be an ex-
tremely important factor, according
to Dr. Cleven, in bringing together
the peoples of the western hemis-
phere and welding into shape an
American nationality which may,
in due time, become the basis of a
United States of the Americas.

Nurses to Sign
For Meetings

A five-day maternity institute
will be held today through Friday
at the Eleanor Gillespie hall, Magee
hospital, as a step in developing the
first line of home defense, the
health of the people.

Anita Jones of the Maternity cen-

ter in New York will conduct the
meeting. The institute will be held
from 10 to 12 o’clock and 2 to 4
o’cloci~: each day. All nurses in the
Vestern Pennsylvania area should
register for the institute by calling
the School of Nursing. There is no
registration charge.

The increased activity in our de-
fense industries makes a maternity
institute pertinent in this area. In-
creasing emp]_oy1nent attracts many
new families. They are likely to be
unfamiliar with facilities in a new
community for the care of mothers
and babies, and this may cause de-
lay in obtaining proper care.

A vital need in the nation’s
health is the reduction of the high
maternal mortality rate. A high
proportion of these deaths are pre-
ventible. The maternity institute
will serve as a refresher course to
nurses to emphasize the methods of
prevention.

Trustees Accept

All for Defense

‘Knudsen Shoaid ﬁe .-lppointed

baa;

By Robert Cook

It is the hope of Dr. John W.
Oliver, professor and head of the
department of history, that Congress
pass the lease-lend program at once
and that the president appoint Wil-
liam S. Knudson, former president
of General Motors corporation, de-
fense-dictator with ﬁnal and com-
plete authority over the entire de-
fense program.

Mr. Knudson is now director-
general of the Office of Production
l‘/lanagcment recently created by
President Roosevelt. Sidney Hill-
man is associate director-general,
and the secretaries of war and the
navy are the other two members.

The moral effect that would fol-
low the passage of such acts upon
countries such  Britain, Greece.
Free France, and the conquered
people in Nazi governed nations
would be impossible to calculate,
Dr. Oliver states.

He believes that if we pledge
“all-out” support to Britain, and
keep our pledge, we will throw

Alumni Representatioit .-Pillars

Continued from page one

Arthur H. James to an ex-ofﬁcio
member, thirteen alumni nominees
were elected to the Board, includ-
ing E. V. Babcock, A. E. Braun,
Graham Bright, Leon Falk J r., Hol-
gar Johnson, Frank R. Phillips,
William Watson Smith, J . G. Rich-
ardson, J. B. Nicklas, Alan M.
Scaife, Herbert N. Riley, William
C. Arthur.

Fifteen members of the alumni
have seats on the Board, but as
terms expire ten alumni trustee-
ships will be established.

One of the provisions of the new-
ly adopted measures is that alumni
representatives whose terms expire
will not hold over or be re-elected
by the Board as alumni-trustees
unless re-nominated by the alumni.
They, however, may be re-elected
as regular members of the Board.

Two trustees were expected to
consider the plan at the meeting of
December 30 but adjourned to at-
tend the funeral of Dr. Ogden M.
Edwards Jr., Board member who
died December 28. '

Numbering 30 members and three
ex-oﬂicio trustees, the governor of
Pennsylvania, the mayor of Pitts-
burgh and the chancellor, the Board
is divided into three classes, the
terms of which expire one group a
year.

Concerning alumni nomination,
the plan reads, “Beginning in 1941
and each first and third year there-
after the alumni shall nominate
three persons, and beginning in 1943
and each third year thereafter they
shall nominate four persons, to be
representatives of the alumni on the
Board of Trustees in the class whose

“Each of the constituent schools

. . may, under the rules and reg-
ulations prescribed by its own re-
spective alumni association, name
-one nominee or waive its right to
do so and shall certify such name
or waiver to the secretary of the
Alumni council . . The Alumni
council shall have the right to name
four nominees and, in addition, to
naming a nominee or nominees to
fill any vacancy created by failure
of a constituent school. of itsright
to name a nominee or waiver of its
right to do so . . .” is another pro-
vision of the plan.

Wright to ..A(ldr'css

Political Conclave

Dr. Thomas H. Wright, national
director of New America, an or-
ganization of liberal socialism, will
speak to students and faculty mem-
bers Friday night, in room 203,
Frick school, announces Hugh Wing,
instructor in English and Pittsburgh
chairman of New America.

Dr. Wright will discuss the ques-
tion of whether America can ex-
pand her democracy while building
up a total defense. “New America,”
explained Mr. Wing, “believes that
our own safety demands all-out aid
to England and encouragement of
democratic forces in England and
elsewhere. Without expansion of
democracy and progressive social
change in the democratic countries,
it will not be possible to conquer
Hitler, Dr. Wright will argue,”
stated Mr. Wing.

tense program. We would there-
fore be months ahead of any pro-
gram proposed for mere home de-
fcnsc. And if Britain should be de-
feated, we will have stepped up our
own defense program to such an
extent that we will be far safer
than if we merely build a program
for national defense only.

Dr. Oliver’s ﬁnal hope is that the
president be given power to draft
labor and industry, as, in his opin-
ion, the occasion demands.

Also commenting on the world
situation, Dr. John Geise, associate
professor of history, contends that
the world is faced with the same
problem which confronted the
classical Greeks. Greek weakness
lay in particularism, the refusal to
yield any portion of the independ-
ence even to strengthen Greece.

Today, national states will not
yield any independence to enable
the creation of a world-wide com-
monwealth of nations. Although
the Greeks failed, we have the ben-
cfit of their example.
