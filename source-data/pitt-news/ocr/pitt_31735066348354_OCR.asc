Proposal: Few
Files Blosed ,

BY CONNTE GIEL

Chancellor Wesley Posvar clari-
ﬁed several points of the so-called
Buckley Amendment during yes-
terday's Board of Trustees "meet-
ing. Elaborating on areas which
may _cause confusion concerning
the University’s policy on the
conﬁdentiality of student records,

_, Posvar stressed that students and

parents do not have the right to
examine all ﬁles. ,
Posvar noted that only the
academic section of a student’s
record is open to examination. The
conﬁdentiality of notes, letters and
other material submitted in conﬁ-

dence remains confidential.

~ covered,” Posvar said.

is not
“People
don’t have the right to see it.”
A The Amendment provides that
past students, or graduates, do
have accessvto their ﬁles, Posvar
said. “But future students, or
applicants, don't. The University
doesn’t have to explain the denial
of admission.” -

Students can question the accur-
acy of a grade or a record to the
extent that an error in transcribing
it may have taken place, but may
not appeal the grade itself or the
professional judgment that went
into the grade, Posvar said. The
Amendment permits parents the
opportunity to call for a hearing to
challenge the contents of their
children’s records.

A provision of the Education

“Personal material -

Amendments of 1974 Act, the‘

Buckley Amendment has. not

significantly affected University
operations. The Amendment,

signed by President Ford last
August, went into effect last
November 19. Since then, few
students and fewer parents have
taken the opportunity to examine
their ﬁles. .

“I guess they’re waiting for
someone to explain it (the
Amendment) to them,” Assistant

7 to the Chancellor David Powers

7 said.

Powers said no problems have

arisen, probably because not
enough students are aware of all
the amendment’s provisions.

Faculty   union hearing.

FAS Rosenberg

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

FAS dean Jerome Rosenberg took
the stand yesterday morning in the
continuing testimonyof adminis-
trative witnesses in the University
faculty A union hearings‘.

Pennsylvania State Educational

‘Association (PSEA) lawyer Ron -

Watzman demanded the University
deﬁne the term “faculty” for the
record during the cross-examina

tion of Rosenberg. He moved to

have all testimony referring to or
using the word “faculty” stricken
from the record after Pitt lawyer
Scott Zimmerman objected to the
question.

“One of the problems with this
case is we have had no definition of
the word ‘faculty.’. The record is
‘replete with witnesses referring to
‘faculty’ with no one knowing what
they’re talking about,” Watzman

Engineers-Greeks
Back Candidates

BY BILL MOORE.

Endorsements for.the SG Elec-
tions have been made by the
Engineering Student Cabinet,
lnter-fraternity Council, and Pan-
hellenic Association, and the three
groups are also appealing a Stu-
dent Government Election Com-
mittee (SGEDC) ruling.

The three organizations have en-
dorsed Larry Platt for SG presi-
dent, and Tyrone Hubbard, Mary
Schwarz, Stephen Tarnock, and
Dan Stifiler for SG Board.

The endorsing groups wish to
contribute $7.50 each to each of the
five candidates, but ,the SGEC
interprets the election code as
permitting a total of $7.50 for
endorsed candidates, not $7.50 per
endorsing group.

The SGEC refused to comment on
the appeal because the matter is

“They (the University adminis-

with their cross-examination.

' The petition, which was ﬁled last

Until now, the PPU has advocated
one bargaining to be comprised of

Editor’s Note: Following is the
ﬁnal installment .of Pitt News
-‘-.3 interviews with Board candidates.
5"‘-The order of appearance was
chosen at random.

Bhuck Davidson

Chuck Davidson was let down
with “the lack of efficiency in
Student Government.”

He described the SG Allocations _
committee as‘ “very unorganized,
and always arguing about things
that seem banal and trivial.” ’

Davidson proposed starting what
he called “Greek Freak Week” to
allow more students to have a
“good time.”

“_The Greeks aren’t getting

‘enough money for Greek Week.
The Board should sponsor Greek
Freak Week to get the whole
student body involved and then
give the Greeks more money,”
Davidson said.

Davidson described “Greek Freak. .
Week” as being similar to the
present Greek Week, but open to
all students. a
Davidson" also proposed restruct-
uring the Undergraduate Academic
Review, student discounts on ‘PAT
busses, and an Oakland apartment
consumer survey. _ . «-

    Stephen Tarnock

Stephen Tarnock said he would
“get out to the students and get
them involved."

He proposed a new set of
priorities for Allocations and a task
force to search out student opinion
on the issue.

Tarnock. complained of “vague
questions” on the Undergraduate
Academic Review. “The UAR
doesn’t present what the students
want to know,” he said. “The
surveys should be taken outside of
the classrooms.” ~
A He proposed a separate course
review for faculty and administra-
/tors aimed at meeting their needs.

He stressed problems of com-
muters. “The Commuter Associa-
tion and SGB should work together
to sponsor more programs during
the day to get commuter involve-
ment,” he said.

   

Tarnock said he would work on

more and lesslexpensive parking
facilities. -

Mary Schwarz

Mary Schwarz said she feels she
could “represent the greatest
number of students” if elected to
the SGB._

She said the Board should have
input from all major organizations
and -‘proposed an. SG senate
comprised of representatives from
all student groups.

Schwarz complimented the Allo-
cations Committee on a “ﬁne job”-
and said “they should make .sure
organizations that do the most get
the most money.”

The Board, Schwarz said, should
look-into student discounts on PAT
busses, consumer surveys, tran- "
script and registration red-tape,
and the possibility of turning the
campus Book. Store into a ‘co-op.’
She was opposed to charging
students for football tickets and
said more students should be
involved in deciding which enter-
tainers are presented at SG
programming 'events. A

Mark Satinoff  
Mark Satinoff said he would work
on the economic issues facing
students if elected to the Board.

“Over the ‘past few ‘years the
federal government has made

substantive cutbacks in educational
aid while at the same time inﬂation
has worsened,” he said.

Satinoff cited tuition increases,
large class sizes, book price
increases, and food costs as

“problems facing Pitt students.

He said his actions on the Board
would depend on student opinion.
“It depends on what they want to
do and I will help them,” Satinoff
stated. '

Concerning economic problems,
Satinoff said he would initiate
educational campaigns to inform
students on the causes and effects
of inﬂation as it concerns students,

He opposed closed-door sessions
of the present SGB and executive
sessions held by the SG Elections
Committee.-

MARK SATINOFF

Bob Ferraro.

Bob Ferraro called for a speed-up
in the Allocations process to aid
organizations which need to know
their budget early.

He said the present SGB was
replicating the work done by the
Allocations Committee. .‘‘It is ‘not
in the constitution for the Board to
do the committee’s work over, just’
endorse it,” he said. '

Ferraro said he would work on the

' resurrection of the Undergraduate ‘

A Academic Review and also said the
Pitt SGB should play an active role
in the Pennsylvania Student Lobby.

Concerning the SU ‘ Annex",
Ferraro blamed the Board "for
“acting too late after the problem
was already blown out of control.”
He said students should have been
involved with the Oakland com-
munity groups.

He also called for more involve-
ment in_ Student Government by
blacks, women, and foreign stu-

ents. '

_ tions meetings.

BOB FERRARO

Tyrone Hubbard

Tyrone Hubbard criticized the

“spectors” in the present SGB and’

pledged to improve the govern-
s ment’s relations with the student
body.

“This year-the Board was full of
phantom representatives. Most
students didn’t know who the
Board members were or what they
did.”

He said he was in favor of giving
credits for ROTC courses.
“Students should have the right to

decide for themselves if they want A

to be in ROTC,”he said.

Hubbard said he feels his election
to the Boardwould encourage more
blacks and minority students to
become involved in Student Gov-
ernment and criticized the SGB for
not becoming involved in the Black
Studies problem last term.

He said the Allocations committee
has little contacttwith the‘ student
body and called for open Alloca-
“If their discus-
sion is going to be truthful and
honest, there is no reason for the
door to be closed,” he said.

to see the ideas are acted on.’

He said he would decide student
needs through surveys, F

Glister was in favor of credits for‘
ROTC courses, and opposed to the
possibility of students being

He said he would look into the
possibility of eight-month leases
for Oakland . apartments and
stressed the importance of building
up a ‘ ‘strong intramural program.”

Evaluation

 A BY HARRIS LEVY
._:Ha;ving a” regular schedule, can
result , in living day-to-day and
losing sight of the larger perspec-
tive. This certainly applies to
college students. When work is
due each week, one tends to go
from assignment to assignment
without a long-range view or plan.
 The frame of mind that college
courses produce also affects think-
ing on political issues.

The real issues can be ignored.
Superﬁciality has plagued exam-

ranging from national issues such
.a’s_,_Watergate, to the Pitt tenure
controversy.
WWha‘t do the Watergate trials
prove? Most people have been
 ‘-content to deal with the guilt or
' innocence of Nixon and his sub-
ordinates. For them the American
political system is a success. After
‘all, many people resigned, were
tried and found guilty.
tThe,_Watergate trials once again
‘demonstrated the inadequacies of
this system. What is really
éoutrageous is the slowness of a
I /process that would let Nixon main-
-vtain his post from the summer of
@1972 to the summer of 1974.
gﬁCong“ress’ cautiousness only pro-
_‘longed the process, as did the
Ccomplicated system of checks and
“balances which creates compro-
, A mise instead of action.
 7‘ ‘ The checks and balances system
‘allowed Nixon to shift the focus of
‘discussion: evaluation of his role in
 Watergate was sidetracked by a
  debate on executive privilege. And

i   The Last Perspective

in a scandal, is sti-ll stable. The real
lesson of Watergate is that we have
sacrificed the government's ability
to act for slavish ﬁdelity to stabi-
lity.

The tenure controversy shows that
teachers are no better off than
students. They too are forced to
produce a certain quantity of
tangible achievements ‘for favor-
able evaluation. This is inevit-
able, considering the means of
ﬁnancial support behind most uni-
versities.

University funding is obtained
from governments, industry and
wealthy industrialists, in many
cases. Industry exerts a lot of
control on government because
only businesses are wealthy
enough to support enormous ex-
penditures for political campaigns.
In turn, government expenditures,
which keeps. our economy, includ-
ing our educational system, aﬂoat
reﬂect industry’s ethics‘and ideals.

Industry evaluates workers in
terms of how much they "produce.
And it’s natural that the same
standards would be applied to
college faculty members. Pitt’s
Board of Trustees is composed of
representatives from government
and industry. which insure the
business-like. running of the Uni-
versity. So through no fault of Pitt
administrators and faculty the Uni-

versity is no “ivory tower” but in
many ways just another business.

If students sometimes get the
feeling they're in a diploma mill, I
suspect faculty members aren’t
getting any better treatment. Since
a main goal of business and
government in supporting colleges
is to turn out skilled workers for
themselves, it’s not surprising that
teachers as well as students are
evaluated by their production.

These are just two instances
which show how easy -it is to
concentrate on the immediate is-
sues instead of the larger struc-
tures behind them. But we must
see the whole picture to challenge
the validity of the rules and their
creators instead of whether they’re

' .bei_ng carried out properly.

  

BY TOM SMITH

Gerald Ford ascended to the
presidency at a time when
Americans were desperately seek-
ing a change in the nation’s'
leadership. Upon taking the oath of
ofﬁce in August, Ford pledged to
end the hostility and divisiveness
characteristic of the Nixon years
and to open government for public
scrutiny. .

Ford was hailed for his openness,
candor and his Mr.‘ Clean image, a
contrast to his disgraced predeces-
sor. And the American people
responded in kind. Early polls
showed Ford’s performance in
ofﬁce was acceptable to about 70%
of Americans. Though the ﬁgure
itself is stunning, it is completely
understandable since the public
usually reacts favorably to vice
presidents who through fate must
assume the - highest’ ofﬁce in the
land. , I

In ﬁve months, however, Ford’s
popularity has decreased alarm-
ingly. Recent polls show only 42%

approve of the way Ford is V,

handling the job. ‘

A quick look at Ford’s ﬁrst months
in ofﬁce‘ can easily explain this
popularity decline. ‘

Whether he liked it or not Ford
had to take on the terrible burdens
of a dec@ing economy -- one which
many think is heading for collapse.
Since 1967 the nation has been
plagued with inﬂation." Nixon was
unable, to handle it and Ford
seemed unable to distinguish
among inflation, stagﬂation, and
recession. His failure to devise
quick solutions for America’s
economic ills has certainly been the ’
most signiﬁcant reason for his
popularity decline.

While declaring it as Public
Enemy No. 1, most analysts say
Ford is fighting inﬂation with a
powder puff. The President has left
the clear impression among most
Americans he doesn’t know what to
do about the economy. However,
he is expected to devise a new
battle plan available soon for public
scrutiny. His press secretary
comments nearly on a regular basis i
that delay is far better than error.

The economy is not A the ' sole
reason for th_e President’s declining
ratings. . ‘

Since August Ford has had to deal
with some of the most serious and
complex problems ever to face this

- nation. Refusing to ignore the
peculiar ‘position of ex-president
Nixon as a A potential convict,
President Ford decided to pardon
Nixon for all Watergate related
crimes. While W basking in the
applause of most fellow Republi-

cans and conservatives, Ford took a

heating at the polls for his action

and gave the Democratic congress
reason to take exception to the new
administration in hopes of occupy-

ing that ofﬁce in ‘76.

At the same time, Ford pledged to
decide the fate of thousands of
Vietnam draft evaders and deser-
ters. He did not appoint a
commission to study the question
of amnesty to report back to him in
two years. After much thought and
careful political scrutiny Ford
provided for a limited amnesty plan
which required that evaders and
deserters work their way back into
the good graces of the country.

Had Ford approved a more liberal
amnesty plan he would have
forever alienated the conservatives
who are the bulwark of the
Republican party. No amnesty plan
at all would have only resurrected
images of his predecessordecrying
junkets \in the peace corps. for
criminals instead -of jail sentences.
This would also have encouraged
Congress to take the initiative for

the amnesty plan. , A
But Ford did act on an amnesty
plan. It brought few cheers,
especially from such groups as the
VFW and the American Legion. It

‘has failed miserably /g_as statistics

from the Justice Department
indicate few deserters and evaders
have taken taken advantage of this
chance to reenter the country.

Many Americans were chagrined
when Ford took to the campaign
trail deriding Democrats with
language reminiscent of‘ earlier
Nixon tactics. This provoked strong
condemnations from Democratic
leaders especially Chairman Robert
Strauss. More thananything this
led to the divorce /of the
Ford-Congress marriage.

In an effort to continue, expand
and personalize foreign relations
President Ford embarked on a
series of diplomatic visits which
many considered to besuperﬂuous.

,He has been criticized for his visits"
_ to Asia, the Soviet Union and his"

summit with French President
Valery Giscard d’Estaing. Even
Barry Goldwater has suggested
that Air Force One be confined to a
hangar. ‘i

Now Ford will be plagued with
revelations of the illegal CIA
activities perpetrated during the
Nixon years. Investigations in the
Congress are sure_ to end in
resolutions which will call for more
regulation of CIA activities forcing

Ford once again to make a decision

unacceptable to someone.
In brief, no matter how hard he
tries,-Ford just cannot win. It will

- take a long time for the American

people /to forget the errors and
deceptions of ‘the Nixon admini-
stration. Ford’s relationship to the
ex-president will affect his popu-

larity for the rest of his term of .

ofﬁce.
Richard Nixon is now perceived by

. the public,as a man who considered

himself untouchable by the people.

— Their disapproval late in his term

failed to have. any affect on his
policies, since he consistently
deﬁed Congress as well as the
courts. His protestations of inno-
cence on national television will not
be easily erased from Americans’
memories.

’ The nation is not likely in the near

future to -put such trust in an
American president. Gerald Ford’s
popularity ‘will suffer because the
American people are determined to
force public officials to realize they
are also public servants. Unless he
can be transformed into a modern
day Jesus Christ, all Ford’s actions
and words will be met with
suspicion and even distaste. He
will be plagued by the fact that he
succeeded. Richard M. Nixon.
Because the ghosts of Watergate
still haunt the nation, Gerald Ford

‘doesn’t have a chance.

Paternoster, director of city plan-
ning, said St. Paul’s is opposed to
having a bar and commercial
facilities located across the street
from the cathedral.’

“The strongest opposition. has
come from the church,” he said.

ln response to Webster Hall’s
objection, supporters of the project
stress the “marginal” situation of
the hotel, which has been on the
market about two years, and the
competitive impact a new -hotel
would have. \ ’

Constantin, whose repair ‘garage
and home is at 4510 Henry-Street,
said, “I feel this ground is just
crying to be put to good use, but I
don’t want to be put to good use,
but I don’t want to be put out of
business and I don’t want their
dream to become my nightmare,”,
he said.

He objects to the change in
existing street patterns which
would limit access to his business.
“lf they shut off Henry Street, they
might just as well take away the
key to my front door,” he said.

Lack of needed parking space for
the area concern him as well as the
possibility a sagging economy may
halt construction midway.

He has rejected two offers to buy
his land as inadequate, Constantin
said, and another to relocate his

business because his garage, pre-.

viously run by his father, has been
in its present location for fifty years
and services a neighborhood client-
ele. His attorney will represent
him at the hearing and vows to take
his objections to “the highest

Edward E. Smuts, real estate
consultant for both CMU and the

support of all the other community
groups we know of.” He added
that every effort has been made to
work with the planning commission
and “our neighbors.” In response
to St. Paul’s concerns, the plans
“were redesigned to minimize
exposure on Fifth Avenue front-
age,” hesaid.

“We frankly just can’t understand
what it is that bothers them,” he
said.

Developer Christner emphasized
the value of the project to the city.
The property, presently, tax
exempt, would produce revenue for
the city. The complex could be
used by Oakland’d universities,
including Pitt. “institutions in the
area tell us they lack ﬁrst-rate
conference, seminar and transient
facilities," Christner said.

it would also make an aesthetic
contribution, he added. “We’re
talking about a very fine set of
structures, architecturally beauti-
ful, whereas presently there is very
marginal and unsightly use of the
area,‘f’ he said.

Both sides in the controversy are
predicting victory. If the planning
commission's long delayed deci-
sion recommends rezoning, the
tight may resume in City Council
chambers or the courts. Onlthe
otheighand, the developer said he
will not execute his option to lease
the land if the decision is against
mixed-usage rezoning. Present
zoing would allow a new hotel, but
not the entire complex asplanned.

  A Faculty Union   for  

 

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
A conversation between two

_ professors was overheard in the

Tuck Shop the other day. “Well, is
there going to be a faculty union on
this campus or not?” asked the
older, more distinguished looking,
teacher. His younger associate who
was eating lunch -- a hamburger
and coke -- replied, ‘‘I really don’t

know anything about it, do you?”.

He didn’t, and the pair switched
topics. ‘

The elder professor’s lack of
knowledge is almost understanda-
ble -- he is probably tenured, living
on a comfortable salary, and could
even be interested in keeping a
faculty union off campus, because
hesees it as a potential threat to
the collegial atmosphere which
exists at Pitt-

But the attitude of the younger
professor is atypical.‘ Chances are
he is not tenured [which means he
does not have job security], and
makes considerably less than his
colleague. Faculty unionization, to
many’ younger faculty members,
means a better shot at a regular
teaching position and an opportun-
ity to have a'contract negotiated .by
the union, which frequently in-
cludes hefty dividends.

These two teachers are only a

0 small fraction of the estimated 2200

currently being recruited for
support by the three. major unions
organizing at Pitt -- American
Association of University Profes-
sorsj (AAUP), Pitt Professional
Union (PPU), and the Pennsylvania
State Educational Association
(PSEA). Three more -‘ unions are
likewise organizing here, but they
seek to represent’ only special
interest groups such as the law or
medical faculty while the main

three want to bargain for all those
faculty who teach inthe College of
Arts and Sciences, plus in a _few
other places. ‘ S

The question being asked by a
majority of these 2200 teachers is:
Well, is there going to be a faculty
union on this campus or not?

The only data on the subject is
now being compiled by Michael
Gold, alGSPIA professor who has
worked with statistical analysis for
more than 10 years. Gold, assisted
by graduate student Dave Phillips,

 

Pitt AAUP President Ray Richman:
Any unions has one strike against

' it-- they’re a threst to the estab-

lished system of governance.

is analyzing the figures from two
questionnaires -- one culled from
telephone interviews in January
1974, and the other by mail. last
October. The results?

“It’s really a toss-up,” Gold Says.
“Statistically and logically, there is
no way of knowing whether the
faculty will vote for ‘unions or
against them. You might as well
ﬂip a coin. It will all depend on

' ionization,

 

 


what happens between now and the
election.” _ A '

Sidney Lawrence, the labor board
hearing examiner who presides at
the hearings downtown-, indicated
last week he expects an election
early next fall semester.

Gold explained there were no
important differences in the results
of the two surveys, both which
questioned 200 faculty and re-
ceived approximately 100 re-
sponses, A final report written by
Gold and Phillips will be available
for the asking in a few weeks.

But just because, as Gold pointed
out, hundreds of faculty did not
make up or change their minds in

the past year whether to vote for or . S

againsta union, (and then which

one?), doesn’t mean there,won’t be '

a few decisive factors sure to ‘be
debated in an election campaign.
Here is a run-down on some of

‘those factors:

THE ECONOMY: It is widely
thought that the economic situation

at Pitt, and how it affects faculty ,_
T. salaries, will be the most influential

of all the factors which might

contract negotiated by a union will A

have "pay-offs -_far
considerations against faculty un-
the unionizers ' just
might get the majority vote needed
to win. ’

Faculty members will also keep an

eye on Philadelphia’s Temple
University, a state-related urban

institution much like Pitt, where
unionized faculty received a 12%
cost of living increase last year,
compared to 7‘/2 "/0 here.

Ray Richman, president of Pitt’s
AAUP chapter, says‘ if Chancellor

_.,‘

Wesley Posvar is ~ successful’ * in A

’ obtaining a 10% increase in’faculty_é-_ .
‘salaries from the state llegislatufe

this year, “it will take a lot of the

recently stepped up their plans for
an informational and recruitment
campaign.

There is no question, however,
that faculty unionization has far
less support at Pitt, some nine
months to a year before an election,
than it did at Temple University at
the comparable time.

“Unions are a way of life in
Philadelphia,” said Temple’s
president Marvin Wachman last
week. “And Pittsburgh is not
Philadelphia. You'll have to expect
different things to happen at Pitt.”

Wachman explained those in
favor of unionization at Temple
were in a majority more than one
year before‘the election. “And the
momentum just kept building up,”
he added.

In Temple’s election in October
1972, the three unions together
pulled more than 1000 votes while
merely 183 teachers voted for no
union representation. The AAUP
was elected bargaining agent in a
run-off election held later.

According to Leroy Dubeck,
president of Temple’s AAUP, there
was two-to-one support for a
faculty union at" Temple even
before the “card campaign” (when
teachers were asked to sign cards
indicating siipport for a union
election.) . 0

“There was never any doubt that
Temple would elect a collective

bargaining agent,” Dubeck said.

ble election: Pitt’-s conservatism
and Temple’s liberalism. There
just might be enough professors,

some say, who are content with

Pitt’s governance process, and

enough who believe the admini-

stration “will take care of the .g‘§
faculty” ﬁnancially, to vote “No” "
at election time and keep a union

If he were eligible to vote, Pitt’s
chief faculty member, Chancellor

« Wesley W. Posvar, would voteno.

undergo the risks involved and face
the possible penalties of a faculty
union,” Posvar said. “In ﬁve years
I may feel differently. There might
be an entirely different environ-
ment here then. My mind is
certainly not closed.”

What is Posvar’s prediction on the
outcome of an election? “I really
don’t know how the faculty
perceives the present conditions.‘
But I think it is. obvious that those
in favor of a union are in the
minority. But what the outcome of
an election might be is something I
can’t predict.” 0 ‘ .

Whether you take Michael Gold’s
advice and “flip a coin,” or heed
the caution of Temple’s president,

“Critics Contest ‘Godfather II’

  
      

BY DREW PORVAZNIK.
The lust for ruthless, absolute
power to control people’s lives
dominates the much publicized and

I "long awaited movie, The Godfather

‘/1

Throughout the movie Michael
Corleone (Al Pacino) comes to
value one thing above everything
else—his unquestionable, absolute»

“his family” and spread its in-

What comes off very effectively is

domain, is angered by hissbrother John Cazale in The Godfather, Part

ike cancer.

Unfortunately, Michael pays a
heavy price for his authority. /He
must sacrifice everything he loves
most, ‘including the happiness and
sometimes lives of his family as in
the case of his weak elder brother
Fredo (John Cazale). His wife Kay
(Diane Keaton) refuses to bear him

“children and she eventually leaves
him because ‘ of “this Sicilian
thing." -

Godfather 11 represents that rarely .

achieved goal in the filmmaking
industry’s ,split personality bet-

ween art and commercialism—that— .

A K‘ of a -movie which will be a box office



bonanza and a work of highly
innovative craftsmanship which
even eclipses the quality of its
predecessor, ' The Godfather.

In part two, director Francis Ford
Coppola juxtaposes the rise of the
Corleone family with that of Mic-
hael's struggle tokeep control over

the “family" and its power told in _

rich, vivid detail.

'I‘h‘e movie ‘opens with Michael's
father Vito (played by Marlon
Brandoin The Godfather) as- a kid
in Sicily having his first encounter
with the Mafia as his family is
murdered by *-the local don. As a
fugitive and an orphan Vito ﬂees to
America.

Later in flashback, Vito (now
played by Robert De Niro) is seen
as a young man in New York who

volved with “the Black Hand." In

and then corrupted by power and
revenge. . i

The film is one of the year’s best
in 1974, a year of mediocre movies.
In addition to flawless, innovative

directing and scriptwriting by Cop-‘

pola, the, picture’s acting stands
out as a landmark. Pacino is
outstanding as he loses his human-
ity and becomes cold and hard as
stone. De Niro is excellent as he
successfully imitates Brando"s

‘mumbling raspy voice and man-

nerisms. Keaton, Cazale and

Strasberg are all also worthy of

Oscar nominiations.

BY M.C. PILECKI

And speaking of disaster ﬁlms [as
we were earlier], there’s an old
saying in Hollywood that “any-
thing worth doing is worth doing a
sequel to.” And so we got

Godfather II, the obvious sequelto.

The Godfather, the all-time box
office [and audience] grosser.
Which leads to another old saying:
“anything that makes that much
money has got to be good.” _
If nothing else, Godfather II will
certainly increase the national
consumption of pasta and tomato
sauce. With nothing to do for three
hours and twenty minutes but
watch a horde of Italians gorge

themselves on spaghetti and vino, '
audiences are bound to leave the .

th_eatres,hungry. For a plot, if not
for food.

Every time the plot bogs down,
somebody gets killed, so by the end
of the flick there are a lot of dead
bgdies littering the screen (includ-
ing one bloodily dismembered
chick who is quite obviously still
breathing). -

Actually, there is no plot in the
conventional sense, just the seem-
ingly interminable tale of post-
Marlon- Brando Corleone family
fighting the war for crime,
juxtaposed with the story of the

‘young Vito Corleone starting the

empire "in the earlier part of the
century. _

.But for three hours and twenty
minutes?! That is real punishment.
An hour could (and should) have
been trimmed easily from this
movie with no loss except to the
director’s ego. "There is just not
enough plot to justify 200 minutes

V of suffering in the average movie

theatre seat. One reviewer for a top
national magazine had to go to
three screenings and piece it
together, rather than
through the whole thing at once.
The story has a number of various

crises, like an attempt on Michael '

Corleone’s life (Al Pacino), his
wife’s (Diane Keaton) threatening

BY JESS M.‘BRALLlER
Arts Editor.

It really doesn’t matter, sorta, whether New Journalism ,or7-" .
Documentary Theatre are art forms. . . 
Of course it'd be interesting to know but why worry? After all, except;
for a few exceptionally brilliant Pitt students and-Webster (who .didn’t-
have much of a choice), the world’s still stumped by the word, “art_’.:’-.. 
But I love the thought of studying both forms as they tend to move" 
things just a bit closer to the renowned “thin line” between art [please
permit me to use the term] and non-fiction, journalism, life or; '_
whatever. . 4 _
Now a discussion of either form presents a lot of problems like, what ;

  
   
   
  
   
  

the structuring offacts in an accepted art form, ﬁction or theatre.- 
Oops, right away w‘e’ve gotten another problem but an important one, es ,
it can’t be art or non-art. First, because if it’s a factual presentation of ] L
life, then life's being presented and that ain't art. But again, if you’re: 
going to use all the elements of an art form, perfect their usage and; ,
mess around with the facts long enough, there’s a damn good chance
that you’re going to end up with an art form. But if we go back, a-
sentence or two we ought to remember that that’s impossible.   '
So all we have is conﬂict which calls for a short story, right Taube?‘
But more than a short story, we’ve got something tremendously:
interesting lying between art. and_ non. art that’s awful near ' the
previously mentioned and notorious “thin line.” Now if you discount
the obvious failures of this column, yon’ve really got something pretty 
interesting and full_of promising study. ‘ 
‘But now we have to be really careful or else we’ll pretend to be
intellectual ‘and end up missing the beauty of this whole mess. Sure,
there’s a tremendous amount of promise * in the study of New
J ournalism or Documentary Theatre. Like maybe, just maybe, it'll lead-__ L .
to the deﬁnition of “art”, or maybe such study will blow wide open the 
garage door. for each form itself, or maybe numerous professors will.be‘~ 
hired throughout the world to lead accredited discussion, or...a‘w hell,--:..i_
the possibilities are unlimited. ‘ '_ H
BUT!! All of this isn’t important. ’ - i 
Because New Journalism and Documentary Theatre have the
potential to replace God, ‘mountains, eternity, time and the Kinks [ye_s,i
even the Kinks] in all those weekend and weekday, homiﬁed, drunken,»
discussion periods. You know, the ones where we enjoy listening to i_ 5
ourselves talk and the ultimate bozo of the group simply busies himself ~ "
with keeping the albums going and where you just might have to make 7
a couple of trips to the Original “O” for the weekly special. Yes, the _ »
potential is tremendous and mainly because I think there’s no answers ‘A
to the questioning of the subject. -
You see, that way we can all go to bed happy, no answers, no _ , 
frustrations just drunk and pleased with ourselves. ‘ ‘ ‘-
All in all, the thought’s a lot like spam, “I love it.”

Hello out there.
Studio Theatre, are you listening?
Theatre in ‘the round, when done

well, creates exciting (and often ~

nerve-racking) moments. An actor
positioned six inches from , your
nose, firing a piercing glance into
your eyes and bellowing at the top
of his larynx is enough to cause an
epidemic of fumbling fingers and
painful glances. I ,

And with a play such as William
Saroyan’s Hello Out There, its
success or failure depends on
audience awareness. Not oflthe

 Lear, also responsible for the

senic design, kept his direction

tightly bound on the play’s subtext. _

He relentlessly chiseled away at
the lines to expose what Hello as a
piece of social commentary, had to
offer.

Hello Out There abounded in its
offering of meaty parts to capable
actors. As the young man, Vlado
Bendevski latched onto all of the
anguish, torment and social injus-
tice to produce a healthy character-
ization. Mimi Skoog protrayed the
young girl not as skillfully perhaps,
but bursting with sincerity.

were well thought out.

Battles between Flora and Ed-
ward raged over the breakfast
table. She was armed with
ﬂower-Button earrings and inde-

structable Timex and he with a,

English accent. Their relationship
vied between at Macy’s bargain-
basement hunter and the compla-
cent English country liver.

Ache dove into the vulgarity and_
disgust of human relationships.
The sheer exultant pleasure deriv-
ed from killing a wasp in a jar of
marmalade provided insight into
man and hid animal instinct.

All of these, Cooprider,incorpor-
ated into her ‘directorial interpreta-
tion of A Slight Ache. But Pinter

had ideas for a director to gorge

himself on.

The problem Pinter’s A Slight
Ache presents is that it hands the
director a birage of sexual, psycho-
logical paraphernalia that must be
focused and molded by skillful
hands.

As a piece of literature, A Slight
Ache contains bits and crumbs of
earthy dialogue, beautifully con-
structed scenes with implied (never
stated) messages. But Studio
Theatre's production, plagued with
cast replacements, worked against
the vitality and strength of the
play. Mediocrity resulted. -

"‘hfas,tovad'rnire the courage and oersistance of Pittsburgh’s “Grand Old
: Man” in his quest to accomplish a feat whichhas come with a lot less
work and in a much shorter time in other NFL cities.
1' So the Steelers are now on top and in the year to come the rest of the
. league will attempt to knock them off their mound and claim the title of
f‘.‘.§lcing‘ of the hill.” As Ara Parseghian was fond of saying, “It is much
more difficult to stay on top than it is to get there in the ﬁrst place.”
» 'j¥B'_ut‘ upon close analysis, it can be argued that this statement does not
7 apply to ‘the Steelers. If it does, we can expect the Gold and Black to go
§~.j_nowhere next season for it would be virtually impossible to put forth as
 much energy in one-half a year as was expended by the Steelers in
their» four decade rise to victory in Super Bowl IX. .
, Of course, no one need fear a collapse on the part of the Steelers.
 Pittsburgh fans should instead expect the establishment of a dynasty at

 3 least on the order of that of the Miami Dolphins.

 ‘The ‘Steelers are still a relatively young team; many of the players
"have not even reached their full potential yet. And as the threat of

'. A» N losing L.C. Greenwood and Frenchy Fuqua to the _WFL becomes less as
i ~ the rival leagues ﬁnancial situation becomes more dismal, it ‘appears
V.-, ; that the Steelers will enter the coming season with an improved team. "

- There is no reason to expect the awesome defense to lose anything in

' 4 _theoff-season. The Steel Curtain should return intact which in itself
'_ is enough to assure at least a winning season.‘ The Steeler linebackers

should show improvement over last season as rookie Jack Lambert

I gains maturity and experience. The defensive secondary is solid and

‘ withithe assistance thev 2et from the front-four, opposing offenses may
,___find it next to impossible to get into the end zone.

 ' , As for the Steeler offense, there lies the key to’ the dynasty. Terry ‘,7
3 ‘.1 Bradshaw has proved his worth but whether he was just on a winning

. streak‘ or has really come into his own remains to be seen. What is

.-=5‘ interesting about the offense is that the championship was won with

only two running backs. The talents of Preston Pearson, Frenchy

in .,Fuqua, and Sam Davis can not be over-looked when discussing the

future of the Steelers. ~
-As for Franco Harris and Rockey Blier, they are just getting started.
Harris’ is only a third year nlaver and hasn’t reached his prime. Blier

' ~ has finally/found a place in the starting backfield, and only a super

speedsterback will be able to remove him.

: :But all is not roses for the “Super” Steelers. Professional ‘athletes
», , have a tendency to ask for (or should I say demand) large increases in

salary after a very successful season. Fortunately for the Rooney’s

"A .. go up next year giving them more money for the inﬂated operating
cost.
. Professional athletes with large pay checks can get somewhat lazy and

[a team of overpaid superstars isn’t always the best bet to win a league
title, as the New York Rangers have recently shown-

I " j ; Of course there is always an unknown variable which could hinder the

e establishment of a football dynasty. Injuries are very important in this
' respect and were very much responsible for this year’s demise of the

The Steelers will be drafting for depth again this year which puts
them in a very good position. They are strengthening their team now

lt’s hard to tell these days
whether the Pitt basketball team is
playing hoop or riding a merry-go-
round. Some games they’re up...
and sometimes they're down.
Monday night they definitely were
up as they took the fight out of the
“Fighting Irish” 88-77 in overtime.
Keith Starr was the big gun for
the Panthers as he hit for 22 points
incuding eight of Pitt’s last 13.
“Keith just did an outstanding

8 job," said the smiling elder states-

man of basketball, Buzz Ridl. “He
was out there playing his own
game, his own style of ball. During
theovertime he became our ball

‘handler because our smaller

guards were on the bench.” _
. Starr seemed to be the man to go

to in the overtime period as he tore -

up the Notre Dame defense with

’ two great drives to the hoop plus

canning all of his foul shots.

“We wanted’ to drive on them
during the overtime because their
big men were in foul trouble.” said

v Ridl.

If Starr was the big gun offensive-
ly, look to Lew Hill and J-im Bolla as
the defensive stalwarts for the

game. ,.

Hill had the unenviable task of_

guarding the leading scorer in
college basketball, ND’s Adrian
Dantley. , .
Dantley had been devastating in
the ﬁrst half hitting for 17 points on
six field goals and four "of four from
the charity strips. _
'."Dantley, did almost the same
thing every time Notre Dame got th
ball,” said.Ridl. “He was moving
to the same place on .the floor

‘ constantly making our plan just to

keep him possibly a step or two
beyond it.”

“Lew’s job was to beat Dantley to
his spot and stick to him,” Ridl
continued. The idea must have

more ﬁeld goals the remainder of
the game including an easy bucket
at the end ‘which meant nothing but
helped his average.
.Bolla on the other hand came in
and played the. inspired game
reminding" many of his great per-
formance against another giant of
the top 20, Marquette. ‘
Using his experience and body
like a brick wall, Bolla set more
than one mean picks along with

. going to the hoop to both score and

bring down some badly needed
rebounds.

“Jim is finally playing his game '

the way he should,” said Ridl.

“He's using more finesse in his’

shooting and not trying to slam the
ball through the net. , Basically he
is being Jim Bolla and if he can just
keep doing the things he does best
he can only help us.”

The game started out with Notre.

Dame looking like the highly rated
team they are (and probably will
remain). Dwight Clay, a name
familiar to anyone who knows

Pittsburgh ball (he is a graduate of -

Fifth Avenue High) hit /forsix of the
lrish’s first ten points. With chants
of, "Go D.C. go,’,’ the six foot
playmaker known as the “Iceman”
blistered the nets_. The rooters
must have jinxed the little man for

Pitt Swimmers Host
Improved Penn State

, BY TOM HALL

Penn State invades Trees A Pool
Saturday afternoon with a 2 pm
meeting with the Pitt swimmers.
The question is, will it be a contest?

“Last week’s meet with Bucknell
was one of the most exciting I’ve
ever seen,” Coach Dick Bradshaw
said. As for Penn State Bradshaw
said, “They are much improved
over last year.”’

Set For
  Action

This week will mark the opening
of. the season for the Women's
Basketball and Gymnastics teams.

Tonight at 7 the Basketball team,
under the direction of Jean Condo
and Jan Kasnevich host Allegheny
Community College at the Field
House.

The Gymnastics team, coached by
Donna DeMarino and Becky Zuc-
carelli travel to, Ohio to compete in
a tri-meet with host Kent State and
West Virginia University.

After dropping a heartbreaker to
Bucknell the Pitt record now stands
at 1-1,, their victory coming over

, Temple by a score of 98-15. Penn

State is undefeated this year with a
1-0 record,'their_ win over Lehigh.
Coach Bradshaw expects the
toughest competition to come in the
diving events. State’s Rich Mau-
rone set team and pool scoring
records in the one-meter diving
event, and -is’ also strong in the
three-meter diving. .

‘fWe can also expect some com-5
petition in the 100 and 200 yard
freestyle,” Coach Bradshaw said.
This will give sprint-swimmer and
team MVP John Schepner a chance
to avenge two split-second losses
‘he suffered in the Bucknell meet.

Penn State is coached by Lou
'MacNeill, who in seven years as
headmentor at PSU has compiled a
record of 21-48. Since Coach
Bradshaw took over. at Pitt, he is
3-1 against the Nittany Lions.

“In a meet like this, strange
things can happen and usually do,”
he said in reference to competing
against his team’s arch rival. “We
tend to swim better against Penn
State than other teams, and they go
out a little more against us.” ‘

The overall record since dual meet
competition started in 1936, stands

 

provided by Dantley, Bill Paterno,
and Freshman Dave Batton who
always seemed to be near the ball.

With Dantley scoring in close and

Paterno and Batton playing toug_lI;<.‘7</ii..-

also, the Irish kept shaving the
Panthers down as they struggled to
find the range with the men from
South Bend leading by _l0.

lhe second half started out much
like the first with Paterno hitting a
25 footer making the score 46-34..

But then things started to turn
around. Pitt tried to run more with
the ball, something they can do
because of Ridl’s conditioning pro-
gram. Notre Dame on the other
hand appearedito run out of gas as
‘the half progressed’.

ADRIAN DANTLEY and
LEW HILL

Lew Hillknown for coming off the
bench to score a ton did just that
scoring 13 second half points._

With the score 56-43 the Panthers 1
rolled off six unanswered points
and the Civic Arena really came
alive as people saw an upset in the
making. \ ‘

At the 2:34 lrnark Bolla hit on a
rebounded Lew Hill shot and sunk-
a pair of foul shots to pull within
two. '

Dantley hit two foul shots and

things looked bleak in the Super/

Bowl City. But Larry Harris hit
from outside to again pull’ within
two. ND got the ball but the big
man Dantley charged’ handing the
ball over to the Cats.

With just six seconds left in
‘regulation the Panther’s own ver-
sion of an ice cube, Lew Hill hit a
twisting jumper to knot the score
and» send the game into overtime.
"l he adrenalin .was ﬂowing for the
Cats as they blew the Irish right out
of the Igloo in the ﬁve minutes to
win going away.

“We can’t really see this game as
a turnaround,” said a happy Ridl.
“Until we win a game away from
home we won’t have a real turn-
around. We just have to be
consistent.”

If the Notre Dame game is any
indication of the type of ball the
Panther’s are capable ‘of, the
opposition had better watch out.

1-edheaded wonder compiled all “On -take-downs‘, we had Navy '

12-14-1 record en route to a spot on
the All-American. team as a 126
pounder.

This year, Adams has Stottlemyer

' wrestling in the 134 class, and so

far he’s handled the switch well,
winning his first match when
Temple wasin town a month ago,
and his second last Saturday night
against tough Tom Bauer of Navy,
on a 2-0 decision.

But it won’t be getting any easier
for Stottlemyer.

“For one thing,” ‘ he notes,
“Wrestlers are much stronger at

134. And then there’ll be guys f
.- . saying, ‘I can make a name for

myself if I beat an All-American.’
They’ll really be gunning for me.”

From Hickory High in Sharpsville,
Rande‘, was one of the best
wrestlers in this state. He chose
Pitt over the successful program at
Clarion State, citing a ‘building
program and academics as main
factors.

He credits Adams and Abajace
with improving his techniques,
especially. on his feet.

Surprisingly, Stottlemyer. ever
the perfectionist, is dissatisﬁed

with his early ‘season peiformancee ,

“I don’t think I’m wrestling well
yet.‘ We had a long layoff (the Navy
meet was the squad’s first in over a
month), so I haven’t had enough
conditionin g . ’ ’ .

Adams’ optimism for this year’s
season is substantiated by the
sophomore.

“We have a lot of potential on this
team,” he said, continuing his
exaltation by pointing out the
grapplers’ good showing against
Navy, despite a misleading score.

reversals. It’s "just gonna take a
little time to gel.” —

Getting back to his own style,
Rande says, “My style isn’t just
laying back and letting the other
guy do the shooting. I’ve' got to
come out and take charge of the
match_.\,’,’_ . ’

The one “wealmess” of Stottle-
myer’s wrestling is that he’s not a
pinner as often as he and the
coaches would like.

“I’m not aggressive enough when
I'm on top. I never was much of a
pinner in high school. I could
usually have a man on his back, but
I just can't always stud him to the
ma .”

But that’s hardly going to hold
back the Panthers’ grappling
fortunes, because, as the ~ All-
American says, “We’re going to be
all right. All we need is a little
experience. ’ ’

It’s 1975 and the basketball office
in Fitzgerald Field House, but it

-feels like the Oval Office in the

50’s. Charles “Buzz” Ridl may be
simply Pitt’s winningest basketball
coach, but ﬁve minutes with him is
enough to bring‘ “I like Ike” to the
lips of the staunchest Democrat.
“My main coaching philosophy is
trying to be myself, not imitating
other coaches, using gimmicks,”
says Ridl, who has been called “the
only honest coach in the country.”
He talks of the need for gaining the
confidence of his players. Hard to
believe anyone could‘ -mistrust a

iman who looks and talks so much

like a cross between Eisenhower
and your favorite uncle.

Ridl’s preoccupation with sports,
basketball in particular, began with,
four years of varsity basketball at
Norwin High School near Irwin.
After a four-year Army term, he
returned to his Alma Mater,
Westminster College for 12 years
of outstanding coaching. During
that time the Titans captured seven
West Penn Conference cham-
pionships in‘ nine years, and

established a total record of 216
wins, 90 losses. P

“He was coaching several sports
at Westminster,” said Ridl’s wife,
Betty. ‘fWe thought he’d relax
here, but it turns out he’s working
even harder at only one sport.”

Well, the hard work has paid off.

When Ridl came to Pitt, seven '

years ago, losing seasons were the
order of the day. Last year, the
Panthers made it 25-4. They’_ve
come a long way, baby. -
The rewards and honors have
been pretty good ‘along the way.
Ridl won NAIA Coach-of-the-Year
at Westminster in 1962 and was
awarded the District II Coach-of-
the-Year Award for the 1973-74
season at Pitt. But more important
to Ridl are the human rewards

‘ involved.

“Enjoying the happiness of the
players after a big win is the best
thing about it. Of course, if we fall
short, I feel that disappointment,
too. When you lose, you disappoint
so many people--the players, your-
self, the spectators. But, the more
people show up for a game, the
more I like it.” He smiles, the blue
Eisenhower eyes radiating the
remembrance of past ‘excitement.

The excitement of the game is life
itself for Ridl. He started working

how skier:

 

 

 

The never-tried-it-befoybut-always-wanted-to-leam-

Fred (from the office) goes every season, and you’re in a

lot better shape than he is—and three years younger. His
wife, Ethel, keeps telling you how much fun it is and how easy,
_and if she can ski on those legs—well . . .

' ‘ Whatever your age or athletic ability, learning to
ski at Snowshoe is easier than learning to swim or play tennis
or golf —and it’s a lot more fun besides.
You see, using our GLM—Graduated Length Method

skis. And under the patient guidance of our expertly trained
instructors, you learn at your own pace. .
Starting with ‘your first lesson after breakfast, b

lunchtime, you'll be skiing down our wide, gentle slopes

A WINTER VACATION AT SNOWSHOE WAS
DESIGNED FOR TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE.

They moming-noon-and-night-sho w-me-some-slopes-
and-po wder-and-Ill-be-ready-in-a-minute skier:

Snowshoe was made for you. With 4% miles of super
slopes coming off a suirnnit of 4,850 feet down through a
vertical fall of 1,500 feet—both the highest in the region.
When you come off the lift and start down 7,500-foot Cup
Run, you can feel the voltage snap, crackle and pop right
down to your boots. Zowie! You’re on the glory trail.

‘Best of all, Snowshoe has more snow than any other --
resort in the region. Our average armual fall is 180 inches
(National Weather Service Data) and if Mother Nature skimps
a little, we've got a snowmaking system that won’t quit.

It makes an acre of snow 12 inches deep, every hour. And at.
Snowshoe, the temperatures are cold enough to hold it.

By the wayfwhen you’re at Snowshoe, if you see.

CHARLES ‘BUZZ’ RIDL

“It takes me about 24 hours to get
over a loss,” says Ridl, and the
wrinkles look a little deeper as he
thinks of the losses. Kind of like
Eisenhower thinking of lost -battles.

“You have to study yourself, what
you could have done, what you

’ should have played differently.

Even as I’ve gotten older, losses

t still bother me as much.”

But,‘like the tempo of his sports
life, the weiariness passes, and Ridl
is enthusiastic again. His passion
for sports and his whole-hearted
approval of the ideals of athletics is
evident when he talks about his
players. I '

“A good basketball player is a
tremendous athlete. There’s no

 place to hide on the court. You

have to be part of everything...
physical power, courage...quick
thinking.”

He's proud of this year’s team,
too. The team is much better than
the record indicates, because
according to Ridl, the away teams
played the best games of the
present season againstthe Pan-
thers.

It’s hard to picture Ridl as a jock.
He uses metaphors continually, the
low-pitched reassuring voice com-
paring basketball players with
actors, coaches’ with symphony
conductors. He urges everyone to
at least try a sport, “something

/adventurous--hiking, bike-riding or
" swimming,” but a fanatic he’s not.

BY CONNIE GIEL

The Man has ﬁnally done it. After
months of denials and discussion
and dissent, General Manager Jack

,,«\Button has reverted to his ways of

" ‘I  His latest move was to rattle

some not—so-old skeletons in the
Penq_uin’s closet.

The Pens’. lacklustre performance
in Atlanta last Friday posted a 3-3
final score and the news that
defenseman Jean Guy Lagace and
goaltender Dennis Herron were
skating to Kansas City. No cause

for alarm in itself, the trade to"

bring goalie Michel Plasse to the
Steel City_ came on the heels of
a mid-season interview in which

Button assured the hockey locals of V

the stability of the club.
Pragmatic but noncommittal, But-
. _; ton said (1) rookie goalies Herron,
./A?‘ 1-Gary Inness, and ‘Bob Johnson
' enjoyed the A “complete confi-
dence” of the Penquin ‘manage-
ment but (2) if another goaltender
was somehow made available, the
Pens wouldn't think twice in grab-

». bing him.

While prefacing the trade of

Herron for Plasse with remarks
perhaps intended to soften the
abruptness, Button made it clear
that negotiations were not of the
spur of the moment variety. The
l?{i‘t:sburgh Press said the talks
nan early in the week. Button

_t the scrappy Lagace in the
ands for the Atlanta-game, which
.:»had the Pens skating tightly using

just five defensemen. The decision '

also signaled trade to those who

know how to speak the language of

GMS. _ A
Lagace, nearly 30, is an on-again,

off-again player who delighted in
the cheers for his spectacular hip
checks but endured booing for his
strange positional play. _He played
with the Pens in 17 games during

’ the 68-69 season, was drafted by

several other teams, and returned
to the Pittsburgh system in 1971.’

His inconsistency prevented him .

from ever playing a full NHL
season; last year's 31 games mark-
ed his high point. Lagace shuffled
constantly from Pittsburgh to Her-
shey, ﬁnally getting themessage
last Friday when Button booted
him out of the Pittsburgh system
completely.

Herron’s Pittsburgh stint was
similarly short-lived and undistin-
guished. He ‘saw action in 18
games during the 72-73 season,
posting a 3.41 average in his first
pro year. .Just 22 years old, he
started with the Pens last season
but, left to work for the Hershey
Bears. .His shaky ‘number two
status, tied with Bob Johns-(>\n for
the honors behind Inness, allowed
him to play‘in only three games
with Pittsburgh. He was bombed

unmercifully in those 108 minutes.

and left the Pens clutching a 6.11
average. ‘
While it’s too early to gauge the
effect of the trade on Pittsburgh,
the Kansas City Scouts must be
happy-with their end of the deal-
Lagace suited up for Saturday
night’s game against the Washing-
ton Capitols and got.an assist and a
penalty. Herron didn’t pl_ay,«but at
least is sure of’ his status; number
two behind Peter McDuffe.
Newcomer Plasse got either a vote
of confidence or a nerve-wracking
trial when he arrived in Pittsburgh
in the nick of time for the Pens’
Saturday night game. The Califor-
nia Seals pushed and poked at
Plasse in his first start for the Pens.
Inness, undoubtedly worn-out
after playing in 34 of.41 games, got

a deserved rest as he ,watched from

the Pittsburgh bench.

V As graceful and mobile as Inness  if
‘is solid, Plasse made enough big

saves to help the‘Pens pull out a 6-3
game. Although Button insists

every save is a “big” one, capable 

of turning the game around’, Plas-
se’s performance pleased the fans
immensely. His efforts netted him’

third star selection after the game,
an honor in this instance given
more for ability and merit rather
than courtesy toward a newcomer.

The first selection in the expan-
sion draft for the Scouts, Plasse is a
product .of the Montreal organiza-
tion. At 26 one year_older than
Inness, Plasse is shorter and

‘ lighter. His 23 games with Kansas

City gave him regular work. The

3.97 average he brought with him’

reflects to a large extent the play of
the expansionist Scouts, and not
sloppiness in the nets.
