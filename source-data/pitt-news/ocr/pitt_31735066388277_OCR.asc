WASHINGTON, D.C. — As the crowd crossed Constitution Avenue,
John Bates delivered clear instructions to them.

“The anti-choice people will try to engage you in arguments,” said
Bates, a member of Oppression Under Target, a gay and lesbian
group that fights for abortion rights. “They thrive on confrontation.
1 gets them all their media coverage, so please, as you walk by, chant,

Co something else positive. Don’t argue with them.”
.ut as the crowd continued on its way to the pro—choice rally at the
LIDCOIII Memorial yesterday, past the pro-life supporters who lined
g"- the way — waving signs depicting aborted fetuses, shaking baby
' rattles and shouting — many found it difficult to follow Bates’ -advice.

“Live in harmony with the natural law,” Marjory Van Meter, a
member of Alexandrians for Life, a Washington area anti-abortion
group, yelled at the crowd. “Abortion is violent, unnatural and ugly.
It’s prorniscuity. You watch too many Jane Fonda movies."

A woman broke from the crowd and handed Van Meter a pamphlet
on the French abortion drug RU846.

“What is this?” Van Meter asked. “I don’t want this.” _

“Ignorance is bliss,” replied the woman, as she scurried back into
the crowd. I _

With a crowd estimated at 300,000 by National Organization for
Women President Molly Yard, the pro—choice rally featured speeches

 several congressmen, activists and members of the international
medical community. According to the Associated Press, U.S. Park
police estimated the crowd at 150,000.
Many‘ speakers noted the victories of pro—choice candidates last
/eek, especially in the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New
Jersey, and the election of David Dinkins as mayor of New York City.

 Over 150,000 converge on D.C. for Pro-Choice rally

1'‘ Obscenities

Cradling a globe in her arms,
Jessica Caplin seemed somewhat
overwhelmed by the chaos of
the crowd huddled around her
on the lawn near Carnegie
Mellon University’s Fine Arts
Building.
and political
statements rang out from the
protestors in the background.
Struggling. to maintain her
composure, Caplin, a CMU art
student, chose her words
carefully as she tried to satisfy
questions from those polite
enough to speak without
shouting ather.

 “I am an artist. This is the way

My freedom of expression has

been taken away from me,”

I l.ynn Caterino
Maura Coyne

The Sisters and Pledge f

would like to congratulate
I their newest initiates!

A Mary Grenevicki Michelle Robinson

Caplin said to the crowd.

Moments after the petite, 20-
year—old artist began her
performance art display
scheduled for 12:30 p.m.
Thursday, CMU police pulled
the charcoal ﬂuid—soaked ﬂags,
which Caplin intended to burn,
down from ropes set up for the
performance.

Through her performance,
which involved burning ﬂags of
the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Israel, South
Africa, Chili, El Salvador and
Pakistan, and then mixing the
ashes inside a globe to symbolize
a new beginning for the world,
Caplin hoped to convey her
expression of personal freedom,
as well as her desire for global
unity.

While some of Caplin’s

supporters shouted, “Go back ,

to Nazi Germany,” members of

Pam Kosco
Nicole Lazarus

CMU’s College Republican Club,
armed with ﬂre extinguishers,
voiced their opposition to ﬂag
desecration by singing "The Star-
Spangled Banner,” as the police
acted out the orders of Ron
Campana, assistant dean of
student affairs, and Bob
Anderegg, senior facility safety
analyst‘ for CMU.

“The safety- conditions

involved in this event forced us '

to cancel it. With the wind,
ﬂammable liquid and crowd
here, someone could really get
hurt,” Campana said.

As the police confiscated the
ﬂags, the crowd, which had
grown to about 200 people in a

matter, of minutes, quickly _
converged on Caplin and her ,

display. Some offered support
and “ encouragement, while

others ridiculed her impression
of artistic freedom.

Before the the performance
started, Caplin was approached
by Campana and Anderegg.
They told her she would not be
permitted to burn theﬂags on
university property. ’

“We’re not so much concerned
about the political aspect of the
display, it’s just not a safe thing
to do on a college campus. We
won’t let anyone burn anything
on the ‘cut,’ regardless of what it

is — tissue paper or ﬂags,”

Anderegg said.

Although university officials
gave their approval for the
performance beforehand, both
Caplin and Campana agreed that
she failed to mention that she
would be burning ﬂags.

“I told them that I would be

-   3
CM U student attempts ﬂag burning as performance art

burning pieces of 100 percent
cotton material. I just didn't say
that the material would be ﬂags, "
Caplin said.

Though Caplin did not achieve
her goal of completing her
performance, she said she gained
a sense of satisfaction from the
reaction of the crowd.

“Making the attempt was a
large part of this piece. If the
intended message reached one
person, I’ve done what I set out
to do,” Caplin said.

“She was ‘not able to
communicate her intended
message of artistic freedom and
world peace because some of
the people failed to see the art
aspect and reacted only to the

political side of the issue,” said '

Paula Giovannitti, a student in_
Caplin’s sculpture class.

-‘Twas no money in those days. My
parents just couldn't afford
another child.”

“It’s horrifying for us to see a
victory [such as] Roe vs. Wade
obtained, and now to possibly
have it stripped from us," said her
friend, Audrey Meyer from
Manhattan, with tears in her eyes.

The other woman, who also

{Would not be named, recalled
the era of the 19503, when she
was teaching sociology at Hunter

“I personally escorted a student
to San Juan so she could have an
abortion,” she said. “I also went
with a friend to Puerto Rico to
hold her hand during one.

“There was always a grapevine
in the colleges, always somebody
knew someone who would be
willing to do an abortion.”

“Students were always asking
mewhere to go,” added the first

,woman, who is also a founding

member of NOW.
Many Republicans gathered at
the rally to express disgust with

views. One of them, Nancy Watt,
traveled from Los Angeles and
held a sign that said, “Another
middle-class, middle-aged, ex-
Bush supporting W.A.S.P. for
choice.” '

“This is going to be the big
issue in elections now," said Watt.
“This time, we’re going to vote
for the candidates who will
preserve our right to safe, legal
abortions. After Roe vs. Wade,
we never expected this. We were
simply stunned; Bush never told

of support because of it.”
Student presence at the rally
was marked with enthusiasm with

college groups from as far away_

as the west coast participating.

“We are trying to put out a
national message that pro-choice
is the majority opinion," said Gina
Olson of Illinois State University.
Olson was a member of the
Midwest's Progressive Student
Network, which was represented
by 400 members at the rally.

don't exist or know what we
want,” said Melissa Ackroyd-
Livingston of the 350-member
group from Bryn Mar University.
She said she wants to see the U.S.
Congress pass a constitutional
amendment making provision of
abortion on demand mandatory.

“We’re showing our elected
officials thatwe believe in choice,”
said Joy Cobb of George
Washington University. “There is
not a single poll that I know ofin

which the pro-life [position] is in »

  Local fmtemity raises

money for youth bome

Former Steeler Mel Blount wishes to help the troubled
youth by creating a home for boyswho have committed
minor crimes or have hadtproblems with social adjust-
ment. ,

The Ku Klux Klan has other plans. It wantsto make sure
that this home never opens its doors.

Washington &jefferson College’s chapter of Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity has taken action to assure that Mel Blount
and his Youth Home get the financial backing and
emotional support needed to roll out the welcome mat
for these troubled boys. I .

Phi Gamma Delta brothers managed to raise $2,500 for

H. the home by holding a tr_ee—sitting marathon outside their

fraternity house. The event began on Tuesday and lasted
until 7‘p.m. on Saturday, reﬂecting the abundant support
of Washington County, where the home is to be built.
Unfortunately, the tree-sit was not the only event

Violence not a solution to racism

OK, I know what you’re
thinking: another article on
racism — big deal. In the past, I
have moanedwith the rest of

_ you. Racism is one of those

topics that you hear oodles and
oodles about, but nobody ever
has an answer for it. Most are

inﬂammatory and probably just *

make the-whole situation a lot
worse. P
Nevertheless, I feel compelled

to" comment on an event I wit- _

nessed on Oct. 29. It was about
2:30 a.m., and I was returning
from an off-campus Halloween

party. I was shoved from behind ,
by a police officer/track star. It

seemed that the entire city—po-
lice squad had decided to take
up jogging. All were headed for
the towers. Curiosity overcame
me, so I joined the race. And so
did everyone else in the imme-
diate vicinity. Lots of cops meant
something big was afoot. (Or

else 7-eleven was having a half- ‘

off sale on doughnuts.)
Unfortunately, the former was

the case. When I arrived, I saw ,

the officers cornering about 20
black students and a few white
students in the dead-end sec-
tion on the Forbes Avenue side

. of the towers. As explained to

me, and verified by sources of
both races at the scene, what
had happened was this: a white
male student (who may or may

I not have been drunk) had ’
punched a black male student -

in the ‘head. The black student
and one of his companions then

proceeded to beat the’ white .

student. The »— black student’s
other companionran into the

I towers’ lobby to ' “sound the
. ‘V alarm.” ‘In a matter of seconds,
I . several more black students (the

number was said to have varied
between 6 and 40, but I person-
ally saw only 12 to 15) emerged

from the lobby. They then pro-'

ceeded to beat the tar out of the
white student.

While the number of specta- in

tors grew, the ﬁght quickly
ended. As soon as the police

appeared the brawlers ﬂed, but ‘

they were rounded up, _ and

. procedures were followed.. _
With the crisis» contained, I I

,—_>_.‘,-~.. . t.__.__.._ ,.'_,,,.,...,.

approached one of the officers
to get a full account of the event.
She told me to “move along” in
no uncertain terms. Instead, I
hung around to see what could

' be seen. The white student was
’ arrested. Two burly officers

escorted him down the stairs.

(One of them punched the stu- _

dent in the face while saying,

V “Don’t look at me!” I don’t know

what the story behind that was,
so I won’t guess.) After ques-
tioning, the black students re-
turned to the lobby. I heard one
of the brawlers (identified by the
crowd as the onewho had been
punched in the head to, begin
this scene) say that if he ever saw
that white student again, he
would kill him.

I know it was probably just an

vexpression, but I was pretty
V unnerved by the whole thing.

So, I discussed the event with
the remainder of the" crowd; The
reactions I got from them wor-

‘ried me more than the fight

itself. Some comments were“‘I
think we ought to kick all-of
their asses,” “It took 40 of them
to get him — what are they,

scared of him?" and “It's all their

[the black students’l fault.”
‘Wait a minute; I didn't see_ it
like that. Isaw a couple of friends
helping out a buddy being at-
tacked by a drunk. Okay, so the
odds were ridiculous — even to

- thepoint of cowardice. (Some of
_ them couldn't even get a hit in '

because others were in the way.)
It still doesn’t mean anybody
should ‘declare war on anybody
else. It is thatattitude that just
perpetuates the problem. ,
The crowd would do well to

realize that it was the white _

student who started it all. His

" motives may have been racist, _

but they may have just been
rambunctious. The black

 

 

right or maybe they were over-

' reacting. If so, who can really

/

blame them? If the crowd had
had their way, there may have

been a much bigger problemf?

Another sentiment aired dur-

ing the post-combat conversa- .

tion was that if you had a prob-
lem with one black student, then
you automatically had a prob-
lem with all black people. That
was whynobody stepped in to

help the guy getting his brains/__

smashed in. . ‘

I don’t buy that either. I know
a couple of black students that I
call friends who want to see an
end to racism justas much ‘as I

do. The way I see it, all of this -

racism is a result of the paranoia
that has been passed down from
generation to generation. This
event seems to ' support my
theory. ' ' ‘ 2*;
The ironic thing is that the
very groups that claim to exist
in order to fight racism are some
of the largest reasons why it still
persists. In order to “help,” they
draw attention to the very thing
that they want everyone to for-
get — namely that there are
important differences between

— these races. Their propaganda

only increases everyone’s aware-
ness of the trivial differences
and encourages -social segrega-
tion. It’s a no-win situation.

Reverend Harvey
states his views

In response to the account of
my talk in the cathedral hall on
the evening of October 18, I note
that Chantal Evans did not pres-
ent either accurately or com-
pletely what I actually said. Mr.
Mark Smith’s remarks do not
really address the subject. I was
amused by his series of cliches,
particularly that “the Church is
preoccupied with sex.” I thought,
as so many writers have pointed
out, that our American culture
was obsessed with genital sex. .

I invite Mr. Smith to read my
book, The Homosexual Person,
published by Ignantius Press, if
he really wants to know what I
hold. Speaking of “evidence,”
Mr. Smith presents no evidence
that he had heard my presenta-
tion, knowing only what Chantal
Evans imperfectly understood.

porary biblical scholarship,
as the work of Robin Scrog gs,
John McNeill, and John
Boswell, clearly demon-
strates that the Bible does
not condemn what we pres-
ently know of as a Lesbian or
Gay lifestyle. Instead, clear
prohibitions are levied
against sins of inhospitaliy
(as in the case of Sodom),
cultic prostitution (referred
to in Leviticus 18:22 and
20:23), andidolarty (Romans
1: 18-52). Further, scholarship
in ancient languages dem-
onstrates nothing short of
miss translations of the origi-
nal texts of 1 Timothy 1:10
and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 as
referring to homosexuality.
Accurate translation points
to references in these texts

that I did not

: did not discriminate against les-

bians. Like Mr. Smith, Laura
presumes to make accusations
without having been present to
hear the lecture. Furthermore, I
did not say that she was ‘dismal.’
I never used the word ‘dismal.’ I
said that if homosexual activity
made people “happy,” how come
Greenwich Village in New York
City has so many sad faces?

‘Why is it that everyone is al-
lowed to have an opinion except
a Roman Catholic theologian who
must be held up for ridicule for
his faith position? One could
hope that a student newspaper
at such a ‘distinguished Univer-
sity would have higher standards
of joumalism than are manifested
in reporting my lecture.

John F. Harvey, OSFS

Director of Courage
St. Michael's Rectory

I was suprised to note your

cover story of Monday, October

23 on the work of Rev. John
Harvey. My surprise is this: I
would have assumed that a
publication at an institution of
higher learning would not con-
vey the narrowness of Harvey’s
position without addressing the
diversity of theological opinion
within contemporary Christian-
ity on the topic of homosexual-
ity. A

For over twenty years, my own
denomination, the Universal
Fellowship of Metropolitan

‘"1 ’ Community Churches, has main-

tained a special ministry to Gay

‘and Lesbian people. It is the

belief of UFMCC that all people
are created in the image and‘
likeness of God and are there-
fore profoundly good —— includ-
ing Gay men and Lesbians.
Contrary to the belief of ‘many

conservative Christians, contem- 

noted that within Roman Ca-
tholicism, moral teaching is
based on dualistic attitudes
which view the body and the
material world as evil and
the mind and things consid-
ered spiritual as good. There-
fore, any sexual expression
which does not meet what is
considered in this view as
the appropriate end (pro-

: creation) is deemed sinful.

This view is lacking for all
people, heterosexual and
homosexual alike.

Of particular interest to
Rev. Harvey’s work is the
removal of homosexuality
from the Diagnostic Statisti-
cal Manual — the handbook
of diagnosis for mental ill-
ness. The current edition of

this manual lists only -the .

dystonic homosexual. This
is the‘ individual who pres-
ents a clear self-hatred be-

‘ cause of their sexual orienta- -
tion. It would appear that ,

these are the people with
whom Harvey works. These
are clearly disturbed indi-
viduals. if ‘

My point is this: as a rnin- ‘

ster and a PhD candidate in
a mental health field, I ﬁnd
Gay and Lesbian people _to
be neither sinful not sick.
Those who can affirm their
sexual orientation are people
to ‘be admired and congratu-

_ lated because they have been

open to receive and cele-
brate the unique grace with

which God has given them. ‘

I strongly encourage Tbe'Pitt
Newsto equally address other
Christian views of homosexu-
ality beyond that of Rev.

‘Harvey’s.

One hundred and sixteen thou-
sand victirns of the Praise The
Lord scandal breathed a sigh of
relief when the jury found Jim
Bakker guilty as charged on all
23 counts. On Oct. 24, 1989, the
defrocked televangelist was sen-
tenced to 45 years in prison and
ordered to pay $500,000. In re-
sponse to Jim’s plight, Tammy
Faye Bakker cried, sang a song
and cried some more on the Phil
Donahue Show. Jim Bakker’s

mother called the trial judge A

“mean.” However ridiculous the
Jim and T ammy Faye ﬁasco may
seem, people suffered.

After the PTL scandal broke,
thousands more elderly, retired
and infirm people. joined the
thousands of victims of Amer-
ica’s religious right. Many of them,
like 74-year-old Estelle Pollard,
afﬂicted with Crohn’s Disease,
contributed heavily to PTL. She
sacrificed food money for Jim
and Tammy’s ﬁnancial pleas, and
she saved enough over the years
from her $300 monthly income
to purchase a stay at PTL’s Heri-
tage Park.

Jim used this money for his
personal gain, and to pay off
Jessica Hahn and others. Remem-
ber a few years back —- the news
media toured Jim and Tammy’s

- home. Five cars, gold-plated ﬁx-

tures and lots of make-up were

just a few of the things that filled

the Bakker’s humble abode.

Free University Press not a newspaper 1

According to the Free Univer-
sity Press, Tbe Pitt News is noth-
ing but a conservative, closed-
minded publication. According
to 779ePittNews, the Free Univer-
sity Press is nothing more than a
newsletter -for the‘ Common
Ground Coalition, not the alter-
native newspaper it claims to be.

Both sides have been argued in V

print numerous times.

the argument is not over. The

Under the flag of each issue of
FUPare three lines of writing that
read: “Free From Advertising —
And Free To You,” “Some Of
What TbePittNewsWill Not Print”

. and “Reporting And Affecting The

News.” :

All three are muddled, if not
mistaken notions. Sure, there are
no paid advertisements in FUP,
namely because the publication
is an advertisement in itself. It
was founded and staffed by
members of the Common Ground
Coalition. Simply read the names

she got screwed. Like many oth-

In their own words, FA is a
national organization chartered
to do two things: 1) support those
who have been burned by the
fundamentalist mindset, experi-
ence and agenda, and 2) educate
the public on the dangers of this
experience, mindset and agenda
—— not only to the individual, but
to American society as well.

After writing 'a letter to their
office in New York, I hoped to
find out what kind of people

includes former fundamentalists
and the adult children of funda-

There is more to the University

the organization may have a large

constituency, it is no more or less-

“anti-fundamentalist.” Moreover,
they fight [tie fundamentalist

 PHT NEWS, Monday, November 13, 1989 T

SGB voter turnout increases in two candidate mce

By Kathie Roth
Staff Writer

Approximately 28 percent of
the College of Arts and Science's
student body showed up at the
polls of the 1990 SGB elections,

«but the turnout was still good

according to Nicole Vitale,
elections committee chairwoman.

“I was very pleased with [voter
turnoutl,” said Vitale.

Of the CAS’s estimated 8,000
eligible voters, 2,215 took part in
Tuesday’s and Wednesday's
polling. Students of the College
of General Studies and graduate
students may not take part in CA3
elections. Each of these groups
has its own governing body,
according to Vitale.

The number of students who
voted is much higher than last
year’s 1,219 bids.,Vitale attributed
the poor showing in 1989 to the
unopposed running of Kent
Baldauf, the current SGB

president.

"I think [this year’s increase] is
due to having two presidential
candidates," she said.

In the past, more students have
turned out when there was a
choice of candidates. For
example, the largest number of
students using their voting
privileges in recentyears occurred
in 1985 when 2,747 students were
drawn to the polls. In that year
three students were seeking to
lead the SGB.

Since that time, voting had
suffered a steady drop to less
than half of that number. In 1986,
2,321 students took part in the
elections. No statistics are
available for the election of 1987,
but in 1988 only 1,751 students
voted. Turnout at the polls hit its
lowest point lastyear with 1,219
bids, or approximately 15 percent
of the student body.

Vitale said that the end of that
downward trend in voting could

also be attributed to the fact that
“all of the candidates worked
hard this year making everyone
aware of the elections through
dorm-storming and such."
Newly—elected President Julie
Shepard said that she encouraged
student participation throughout
her campaign. “Instead of just
saying ‘Vote for me,’ I was just in

Shepard also felt that the
increased involvement of the
Black Action Society had a big
inﬂuence on this year’s elections.
“BAS was very active in their
endorsements and their
campaigning. Once they
endorsed us they introduced us
[to their members] and really
encouraged members to vote, as
well as putting up posters on

explaining the elections process
and the function of SGB to
students.

He said, “When I did speak in
the dorms, a lot of the students
were not aware that you could
vote for more than just one board
candidate and one presidential
candidate.

“Many students were kind of
angry that the candidates were
posters, not people. It was more
of bringing the campaign to a
personal level."

The candidates are not the only

students interested in increasing

the number of voters. Each year
the elections committee works to
organize such events as Meet the
Candidates and the Presidential
Debate which are designed to
increase student awareness and
voting, according to Vitale.

Presently, she is considering a
plan withjoyce Giangarlo, adviser
to the elections committee, to
revise the format of the election
itself.

“We are thinking of changing
the voting to one day with 10 or
11 polling locations,” she said.

This set-up would eliminate theh

present two-day voting period
which makes use of seven voting
sights.

According to Vitale, this plan
would make it easier for students,
particularly for those not living
near or passing by the polling
locations, to take part in the
election. She feels students are

more likely to vote if it is more ,.

convenient for them.

Vitale mentioned “adding a
voting sight up on the hill [near
the fraternity housesl” as an
example of the plan.

She said that changing the

voting period from the present _

two days to only a single day
should not have a negative effect
on the number of students voting.

“The best turnout is on Tuesday, '
1 though this year it was the same

in the towers on both days.
Towers always has the best
turnout.”

The proposed plan is hoped to
increase student participation in
the selection of SGB members.

want to raise the voting turnout.”

Panthers swept away by Hurricane balanced attack    

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

If the old expression says “Get
it in gear!” then the Panthers
could not find first gear on
Saturday afternoon.

Pitt compiled 28 yards rushing
on 30 attempts for a .94 yards-
per—carry mark, netted five total
return yards and had its freshman
quarterback Alex Van Pelt sacked
four times as the offense sputtered
all day long in a 24-3 loss to the
Miami Hurricanes.

The Panthers held the ball for
25:02 of the game and kept an
initially strong defense on the
field long enough to the point
where they finally wore
themselves down.

Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried was

not upset by the team's most
recent losses to Notre Dame and
Miami, teams which he labels as
being “on a different plane.”

“I think we just [have] to keep
working. Notre Dame has not
lost a ball game in two years, and
Miami has won 49 out of 51. If
you question whether or not you

V get beat by somebody like this,
_ that’s for you to question. As far

as I’m concerned, we played hard
and got beat by good teams.

We’re not a failure because we‘

‘lost to these two teams," Cottlried
said.

Hurricane fullback Steve
McGuire, formerly a third stringer,
replaced starter Leonard Conley
and tore up the turf, recording
114 yards on 25 carries with one
touchdown. McGuire, after his
second consecutive 100-yard
game, was surprised and
unimpressed with the way the
Panthers came out -to play in a
game which both teams "needed
to stay in_ contention for a major
bowl bid.

“Pitt just came off a 45-7 loss to

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News

The Pitt offense fell ﬂat on their faces making numerous, big mistakes in their 24-3 loss to the Hurricanes on Saturday.

Notre Dame. I thought they were

. going to come out hitting hard,

but they didn’t I think they lied
down late in the first quarter  I
think that’s when they gave up,”
McGuire/said.

Pitt has not won a game in a
month, due to consecutive weeks
off before Notre Dame and Miami,
and McGuire thinks the time Pitt
claims to use to “regroup, heal
and get ready for the next game”
worked to its disadvantage. -

“That’s kind of hardfor them to
come off a week off and /come
out and play hard against a good
team like Miami," McGuire said.

“That was like us going against
Florida State [Miami’s only loss of
the season on Oct. 28]. We had
that week off and that really set
us back, so I figure that’s what
happened to Pitt.”

Pitt has lost the past two games
by a score of 69:10, atone time
allowing 67‘-unanswered points.

Saturday’s game was marred
by mistakes, missed opportunities
and still more penalties; problems
which have been plaguing the
Panthers all season long against
every opponent.The Panther
defense dodged a bullet early in
the first quarter by executing an

impressive goal—line stand. Pitt

punter Brian Greenfield fumbled
"a bad snap and recovered the
ball on the Pitt 3—yard line instead
of taking a safety in the end zone.

Miami failed to score a touchdown
from the Pitt 3 and had to settle
fora Carlos Huerta ﬁeld goal.

Miami’s next drive of the first

quarter was a textbook 10_ play,
81-yard romp capped by an 8-
yard McGuire touchdown run as
they took the lead 10-0.

Pitt’s defense came up big to,

See 24-3, page 12

Pitt football in need of fresh, new leadership

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
had one very correct analysis,
and at the same time one very
pathetically unﬁnished analysis
of his team's recent uninspired
losses to the powerful Notre Dame
Fighting Irish and the equally
powerful Miami Hurricanes, the
latter occurring this past Saturday
afternoon.

“We're not a failure because
we lost to these two teams,""the
disheartened Gottfried
announced.

That, in a way, is a very true
statement, when considering just
how good the Irish and the ‘Canes
are. Miami simply has been the
most successful football program
of the ’80s, while the Irish, well,

they simply haven't lost a game

-,4

in nearly two years.
But now —'—  apologies to
those’ who subscribe to. the

“Winning isn't everything; it’s the I

only thing” theory of sporting

event outcomes —' let us examine
Gottfried’s statement in light of
another school of thought: the
“It's not whether you win. or lose;
it’s how you play the game” view.
Continuing where Gottfried left
off, Pitt is a failure because of_
how it lost to those two teams.
In both games, the Panthers
made glaring mistakes, dropped
easy passes, committed
inexcusable penalties, tackled
poorly, dug themselves into hole .
after hole and basically were
unbelievably lousy. Considering
the ‘ talent that the Pittsburgh
Panthers possess, they have been

I failures.-

Granted, there have beensome
solid individual performances for

"Pitt over the past two games.

Alex ‘Van. Pelt, the young
quarterback of the team, has

* performed admirably considering

_.............. . . . . .... . . . . . A . -.

the amount of dropped passes
and the lack of pass protection
that he has received and has
been forced to deal with. The
defensive line as a unit has lived

 

up to its expectations.’VEven the
defense as a whole has been
respectable for the most part.
But for a team that is supposedly
one of the most talented in the

nation, the Panthers have been A

destroyed 45-7 and 24-3 against
the only true competition Pitthas

faced all season? Somethi_n'g'is 

once again --'- seriously wrong

with the Pitt Panthers.

Fans and media speculated that
the reason for the Panthers’. poor
start — win—loss records aside -
was that the Pitt coaching staff
was hiding the playbook, trying
not to show the whole package,
so that , when the Irish and
Hurricanes arrived on the
schedule, the Panthers could
surprise them with the one—two
punch to the chops for the
knockout, the old ‘Howard
Schnellenberger way.

Evidently, Pitt was showing the
whole package all along, penalties
and poor execution and
sloppiness included.

In the past four seasons, Pitt

has managed to beat only‘ six

teams that finished the year "with-

_winning ._rec.ords- Two of those,

teams" were ' ‘Kent’ State’ and

Rutgers. That is not the mark of a A

 

good Division I college football
team, let alone an outstanding
one.

Mike Gottfried has been the

Panthers’ head coach during all
four of those years. His teams
have made the same mistakes
over and over, lost in the same
ways over and over. They have
simply not gotten any better in
any obvious capacity.

Pitt is not a good football team,
despite misleading records filled

with the wins over Paciﬁc,’-

Syracuse, Boston College, Navy

and Temple and the tie with West '

Virginia.

It is time to seriously step back
and look in the direction this
program  headed. It is also
possibly time to go out and once
againlook for a new compass.

Miami fullback Stephen McGuire (30) rushed for 114 yards against the Pitt defense.

 

McGuire stars for Canes

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

In September, Stephen McGuire
didn’t stand a chance.

The Miami freshman was the
fourth-string fullback playing for
a pass—oriented football team. But
when starting fullback Leonard
Conley went down with an ankle
injury two games ago and the
Hurricane coaches designed more
running plays, McGuire, who was
redshirted last season, got his
chance to prove himself.

Prove himself indeed. In his
first game with substantial playing
time against East Carolina last
weekend, McGuire rumbled for
136 yards on just 14 carries and
added three touchdowns. Pitt was

the next victim of McGuire ’s rough

running style.

Hurricanes 24-Swin over Pitt. He
also caught a big 18-yard pass in
from quarterback Craig Erickson
on a third-and-11 situation. Most
of McGuire’s damage came in the
first half as he racked up 73 yards
rushing, including an &yard
touchdown run in the first quarter
giving Miami a 10-0 lead. Pitt had
84 total offensive yards in the first
half; McGuire had 91.

“I just wanted an opportunity
to show my talent in a big game
like this,” said McGuire. “I didn’t
expect to play the role I did today
because the coaches told me that
I might not get the ball that much.”

According to Miami head coach
Dennis Erickson, MCGuire’s tough

running style fits perfectly into

the one-back formation that the
Hurricanes often use. “Stephen
really came to the forefront this
week. His ability to run inside
helped him tremendously,”‘said
Erickson. -
“I just take advantage of th
good blocks and run over people,
perhaps,” said McGuire. “I didn’t
really like the one-back formation
at first. I didn’t think I would get
much of a chance to run the ball,
but it's worked out real well so
far. Once we start running the
ball well, we could setup defenses
with S play—action fakes and
different formations."

Lady Panthers downed by PSU  

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

It was deja vu for the Lady
Panther volleyball team last
weekend when it traveled to State
College I for the Penn State
Volleyball Classic.

In an almost exact repeat of a
match three weeks ago at home,
the Lady Panthers won handily
15-5 in the first game, but then
lost their composure and three
straight games to the Lady Lions
(9-15, 4-15, 7-15). Pitt defeated
the‘ Tennessee Lady _Vols (15-8,
15-15, 15-8) and the Central
Michigan Chippewas (15-7, 15-
15, 15-12) at the tournament,
pushing its record to 26-7.

“I think we have a mental block
against Penn State. We committed
a lot of unforced errors, and they
[Penn State} didn’t play particularly
well either,” said Pitt head coach
Sue Woodstra.

Julie Sheils and Lori Silk led the
Panthers with 11 and 10 kills
respectively against Penn State.
The Panthers hit for a .144 kill
percentage against the Lady Lions
(kills minus errors divided by
total attempts) who turned in a
.227 clip against Pitt.

“That's not the only [negative]
stat. We also served 12 balls out
and only had three aces. We have
to do better than that,” Woodstra
said.

Pitt had ‘a much easier time
against the Lady Vols, holding
them to a .065 kill percent and
hitting .325 themselves. Silk led
the way with 10 kills, and Dee
MacAuley and Sheils contributed
seven apiece. Sue Zonneville and

MacAuley were named to the All-
Tournament team.

Lady Panther Notes: This
weekend Pitt travels to
Providence for the Big East
championships. The Lady
Panthers are the defending
champs and will probably be the
No. 1 seed again this year.
According to Woodstra, Syracuse

should be the second—seeded

MacAuley each punched in eight .

kills in the Central Michigan
Victory.

team. The Lady Panthers have
already defeated
Orangewomen this year.

Woodstra also said that her
team will probably need some
outside help if it is to receive an
NCAA tournament bid.

“Right now, we’re right on the
edge. If there’s an upset in a
conference tournament
somewhere, then we have a good
chance, but-right now I think our
chances are slim."

  “I16 have three important objectives in going for graduate
‘ studiesin the arts and sciences: academic achievement,
I prolessional advancement and personal enrichment.
Fordham satisﬁes all three.” é‘:;:..“.“.:1:*;£;*;.*’:.‘7.',.*:=*.::i::::::::“"'“

A Master's, Doctorate or a course for
personal enrichment from Fordham’s
Graduate School of Arts 81 Sciences is
everything it should be.

As Peter Hatlie says, ”It’s very
rewarding—the professors demand a lot,
but they give back a lot—they’re very
accessible.’ ’

. It carries with it a respect which has
been earned through Fordham’s long-
standing commitment to excellence.

The Fordham tradition, plus our broad
curriculum, will help you achieve ‘the
goal you've set for yourself—enrichment,
scholarship or professional reward.

And if you prefer to start with enrich-
ment courses now, you may take as
many as 12 credits which will count
towards your degree once you're accepted.

We invite all undergraduate degree
holders to discover more about our
numerous and varied programs. They
range from the natural and social sci-

_ ences to the humanities and include
such programs as our multi-disciplinary
International Political Economy and

Continued from page 9
receiver Lamar Thomas into the
hands of a diving Louis Riddick.

However, the offense could not
get anything going, running three

plays and punting.

The ensuing Hurricane
possession resulted in a 12 play,
SO-yard drive with Huerta kicking
a 27-yard field goal as Miami
went up 13-O.

Midway through the second
quarter, the blunders started to
haunt the Panthers. On second
and nine from the Panther 42,
Van Pelt attempted his first long

air strike of the game to Henry
Tuten. Tuten had his defender
beaten by 10 yards and literally
waited for the pass to come down,
but wound up dropping it on the
Hurricane’s 8.

On Pitt’s next drive, the ball
was moved all the way to the
Hurricane’s 16. But on second
and six, Van Pelt’s pass intended
for Tuten was picked off in the
end zone by Kenny Berry, stalling
the first real offensive threat by
the Panthers on the day.

The half ended with Pitt
amassing minus 15 yards rushing

and 84 total yards. McGuire
alreadyihad 73 yards, and the
Hurricane offense went to the
locker room with a healthy 203
total yards.

Panther fullback Ronald
Redmon, who somehow wound
up as Pitt’s leading receiver, said,
“We tried to establish the running
game, but we were never able to
get it going. We tried to go with
short passes and passes to the
tight end.”

Van Pelt, who went 19 for 35
with two interceptions, suggested
that the Panther offense may suffer

from a lack of confidence against
the exceptional teams in the
nation.

“We have the plays to beat any
team. We just need to have a little
more confidence in ourselves.
We have to stop worrying about
how good the defense is and get
the idea that the plays are going
to work]? Van Pelt said.

A Huerta ﬁeld goal and an
Erickson pass to wide receiver
Dale Dawkins was all the scoring
in the third quarter as the

.Hurricanes entered the final 15

minutes with a comfortable 22-O

Panther place-kicker Ed Frazier
booted a 29-yard field goal early
in the fourth quarter to put all of
Pitt’s points on the board for the
afternoon.

On Pitt’s next drive, Van Pelt
was sacked in the end zone by
Lombardi Trophy finalist Greg
Mark for a safety to complete all
the scoring that was to be done.

The Hurricanes have
consistently been a team whose
offense has been in the spotlight.
But the defense may be earning
its credibility this season.

“The [Miami] defense has played
as well as [it has] all year,”
Hurricane Coach Dennis Erickson
said.

“Offensively we played
conservatively because I didn’t
want to screw the defensive
effort.”

“We showed today that we are
a team to contend with. i feel the
only way we can hurt ourselves is
by our own poor play,” Mark
said.

The Panthers will most‘ likely
play in the John Hancock Bowl
on Dec. 30 in El Paso, Texas,
provided they beat East Carolina

Swimmers remain unbeaten

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s swimming and
diving team, led by two victories
apiece from Eric Mattson, David
Schepner and Kevin McLaughlin,
defeated Clarion University on
Friday at Trees Pool, 185~110.

Mattson won both the 200—yard
butterﬂy 0:56:59) and the 400-
yard individual medley (4: 13:27).

“I was very happy with my

times,” Mattson said. “Clarion ‘

wasn’t much competition, but
our team still swam very well.”

Schepner was victorious in the
500 and 1,650 freestyle events
with times of4:42:11 and 15:53:91
respectively. In- the 1,650 he
clearly dominated with the nearest
ﬁnisher over a minute behind
him.

McLaughlin’s two wins came in
the 100 and 200 breaststrokes

with times of 1:00:80 and 2:12:35.

One of the few negatives for
the Panthers was that their perfect
streak of winning every event
this season was broken, largely
because of Clarion’s Greg
Cunningham. He won the 50
freestyle, the 100 butterfly and
was a member of the victorious
200 medley relay team.

Clarion’s team victory total was
four, with its other win coming
from the 400 freestyle relay.

The other winning swimmers
for Pitt were TJ. Erdos (200
freestyle), Mike Kozlina (100
backstroke), William Folger (100
freestyle) and Alfred Constantini
(200 backstroke).

Pitt also won both diving events;
1-meter and 3—meter. John
Sharkey and Michael Naylor were
the winners.

stands at 3-0. They will be facing
their toughest competition of the

"season this Saturday when they

travel to the University of Virginia.
Pitt Coach Dick Bradshaw
compared the magnitude of this
meet to a college football matchup
between two top 20
powerhouses.

“They are a very outstanding
team,” he said. “That’s going to
be a real match.” '

Mattson, who realizes the added
strength of Virginia thanks to a
great recruiting class, still
expressed optimism for the meet.

“If we swim really well, I think
we can beat them,” he said.

McGuire  

Continued from page 10

The varied offensive looks
the Hurricanes showed Pitt
often had the Panther defense
confused and not knowing
what ‘to expect. Miami, a
traditionally great passing
team, ran the ball 44 times in
the game and attempted 42
passes. Coming into the Pitt

‘game, Miami had attempted

349 passes andjust 520 rushes.
Theytotaled 199 yards rushing
and 217 passing against the
Panthers.

“I give all the credit to the
offensive line,-” said Erickson.
“They made all the plays work
well today. It was a good
game, and Pitt has a very
good team, especially their
defensive line. We missed
some good opportunities to.

score, but that’s the game of
football."

McGuire was surprised at
the margin of victory,’ but
agrees with Erickson that the
score could have been even
more lopsided.

“We didn't expect to win
by this much, but it just
happens sometimes,” said

 McGuire. “It could have been

a blow—out, but we had too
many mistakes and penalties.”

McGuire, although soft-
spoken in the post-game
interviews, displayed that he
could also fit in with-the
tradition of cockiness that the
Hufricanes have built. After
his‘ 8-yard "touchdown

scamper, he casually ﬂipped‘

the ball to the Panther mascot.
