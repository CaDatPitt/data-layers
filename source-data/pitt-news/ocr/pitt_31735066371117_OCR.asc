Bulimia claims greater numbers

continued from page one

bulimics fall into their pattern of

behavior. .

' Phelps treats her patients by help-
ingthem find other ways to deal with
their problems. - -

Dr. Francis Harris, clinical psy-
chologist at Western Psychiatric
Clinic, takes a different approach to
treating bulimics. He believes that it
is important to help patients plan
balanced diets. This may..include
having the patient see a dietician to
correct myths about calorie intake.

At Western Psychiatric. patients
are alsotreated with behavior modi-
fication thera'py and anti-
depressants such as lithium, Harris
said.

Because many of the eating dis-
order patients are seriously under-
weight, they are treated as
in-patients to monitor their food
intake, Harris said.

The success rate for curing in-
patient bulimics isn‘t as good as the
50 percent success rate with out-
patients due to the severity of their
conditions. But once a person
becomes bulimic, even if doctors
have helped her to discontinue her
behavior, there is always the chance
that under stress, the binge-purge
behavior will reoccur, Harris said.

Harris sees a wider variety of

A patients than Phelps does in her

practice, «which is restricted to the

, Pitt campus. The majority of buli-

mia patients at Western Psychiatric
are women between the ages of I6

presents A

and 30. However, they do see
patients that are as old as ‘50. In
addition, 5 to T0 percent of their
patients are men, according to Har-
ris, who adds that many of the
bulimics that he sees have drinking
problems as well.

For The Pitt News

If you have ever considered apply-
ing for financial aid at Pitt but were
discouraged by the assorted acro-
nyms -- PHEAA. PELL. SEOG.
‘CWSP. NDSL. FAForGSI. -- fear
not. —

Applying for financial aid
requires nothing more than an
investment of time. patience and
faith. according to Suzanne McCol-
loch. associate director of student
aid.

PROCEDURES

Staff members at the Student Aid
Office offer the following tips for
financial aid applicants:

0 Students must complete a Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh application for
financial aid. All applications may
be obtained at the financial aid
office in Bruce Hall.

0 Dependent students must send a
copy oftheirfamily’s I040. I040A or
I040EZ form to the financial aid
office. Independent students must
send a copy of their own I040 form.

0 Students must fill out/the FAF.
or financial aid form. and forward it
to the College Scholarship Service in
Princeton. N.J. On this form. the
student should indicate that infor-
mation provided should be sent to
Pitt and to the Pell Grant program.

IN STATE/OUT OF STATE

Pennsylvania residents must com-
plete the PHEAA. Pell Grant and
Pitt financial aid applications. Stu-
dents are then automatically eligible
for consideration by each of the
agencies.

Out—of—state students should write
to their states grant agency and
request an application.

These students must also fill out
an FAF form and indicate that the
information provided should be sent
to Pitt and the Pell Grant program.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT‘?

The financial aid office then esti-
mates the amount of PHEAA and
Pell grants the student is eligible to
receive. A letter from the financial
aid office informs the student of his
award:

The total award must not exceed
the demonstrated need of the stu-
dent. This is adjusted by Pitt.

Application deadline is April I for
returning Pitt students.

WHO GETS IT‘?

Family size. medical expenses,
number of children in post-
secondary education. assets and
debts are all considered by the finan-
cial aid office. According to statis-
tics prepared for the New Faculty
Orientation. 65 percent ofall incom-
ing freshmen at Pitt receive financial
aid.

Applicants for federal financial
aid must satisfy the following
requirements:

0 Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-
citizen.

0 Be registered for the draft with 4

Selective Service if you are a man

'0‘ who is at least I8 years old and born

Lady sprinters win three

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -«R
Lady Panther track coach Elbert
I(ennedy‘s commitment to quality
rather than quantity was. made evi-
dent at Saturday’s West Virginia
Invitational.

The Pitt team, composed of six
members, finished with 42 points.
Penn State walked away with first
place (148), George Mason and host
West Virginia were second (106) and
third (78), respectively.

Led by junior Renee Henderson
and freshman Edith Butler, the Lady
Panthers won three events ~ the
400—meter dash, the 300—meter dash
and the I600-meter (4x400) relay.

Henderson won the 300-meter
dash by more than a full second as
she was clocked in 40.16. She fin-
ished second in the 55-meter dash to
another Henderson, this one
Tammy Henderson of West Virgi-
nia. Despite not winning the event,
Henderson's time of 6.99 officially

qualified her
championships.
“Earlier in the year, I qualified by
hand time [stop watch]," Renee
Henderson said. “But you have to
qualify by an automatic timer.
Today, I did that. [I’m ahead of last
season’s pace because] I didn’t even
qualify for nationals last year."
Butler went under 57 seconds in
the 400-meter dash for the first time
in her brief indoor track career. She
beat a pair of George Mason girls
while breaking the tape in 56.96.
“A week ago at East Tennessee, I
had lane six, and I didn’t know how
to use it,” Butler said. “During this
past week, Ken [coach Kennedy]
taught me how to use it. I stayed
relaxed the whole race. This was my
second time at West Virginia, and I
lowered my time by two seconds.”
The most thrilling ofthe three vic—
tories came in the final event, the
l600—meter (4x400) relay. The Pitt
team of Felicia Blake, Henderson,
Gail Counts and Butler covered the
distance in 3:50.23 nipping George
Mason by .08 seconds.
The anchor leg was run by Butler.

straight away, Butler was being
chased by the George Mason anchor
but was able to hold her off.

“I had a lot of anchoring experi-
ence in high school,” Butler said. “I
heard her footstepbut kept going.
When you run a relay, it’s like you
have four people running inside of
you instead ofjust one.”

“I think you found out today that
Edie [Butler] doesn’t give up,”
Kennedy said. “That girl [from
George Mason] thought she was
gonna catch her.”

Sophomore Sue Torre and
Counts also competed in the 55-
meter dash. Torre made it to the
semi-finals but failed to reach the
finals while Counts placed fourth
(7.23) in the finals.

Blake fell in the 800-meter run but
was able to beat two competitors
after regaining her feet.

The ladies appear to be headed in
the right direction with the Big East
conference championships only
three weeks away.

This week, the team travels to the
Princeton Invitational.

Panther

, swimmers

bumped
at WVU

By Mary Daigle
For The Pitt News

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — It
would be easy to make up those
excuses that supposedly justify los-
ing, but the Panther swimming and
diving team made none following
the crushing 69-44 defeat at West
Virginia.

“We were beaten by a better
team,“ Pitt swimming coach Fred
Lewis said Saturday, “and we‘re
going to have to work a lot harderto
beat these guys."

The Mountaineers (6-6) handed
Pitt its first loss of the dual-meet
season after the Panthers had reeled
off five straight wins.

“We go for the duals." Lewis
added. “Our goal was to go unde-
feated' throughout the dual-meet
season."

West Virginia put the pressure on
Pitt from the opening event and
built on’ it until the Panthers were
too far behind to make a run.

“They attacked us mentally from
the start," Pitt senior Ed Bergan
said. “I know that when they took
one-two in the 200 [-yard] and 1000
[-yard] free[style], it affected’ us
mentally, especially our younger
guys."

“After the first few events. every-
one gave up, and we fell apart.“jun-
fior diver Jeff Luffey said.

The Mounties were able to take
full advantage of two important fac-
tors: home pool and underdog
status.

“You guys bring out the best in

us." a Mountaineer said to Lewis

Distance freestyler Tom
against. West Virginia.
following the meet.

“Since we beat LaSalle so easily
[last week] and they [West Virginia]
just barely beat them. we figured
that we shouldn‘t have too much ofa
problem today," Bergan said.

Throughout the competition, it
seemed as if Pitt was missing that
little extra momentum that kept it
from winning the events to which it
has become accustomed to winning.

Senior Ed Bahan's hex over Penn
State. LaSalle and WVU was even
broken. The anchor leg of the 400-
yard freestyle relay is Bahan’s spe-
cialty spanning over two seasons,
having defeated the same three
teams five consecutive times.

In typical fashion, Bahan hit the
water trailing his’ Mountaineer
counterpart. and it was assumed
that he would overtake the leader
and win.

Neither Bahan’s performance nor
the team‘s resembled anything typi-
cal —— at least according to 1984
standards.

In the one- and three-meter diving
events, the Panthers held their own
but were unable to get either top
spot.

‘‘I’m not real thrilled about today,
but I'm not down.” Pitt diving coach
Julian Krug said. “I said before the

Shaulinski competing

meet that they have one very good
kid and that we would have four
guys going after him.“

Panther Todd Mulzet placed
second in the one—meter event. West
Virginia senior Bill Treasurer held
on to win by a mere seven points.

“I’m looking forward to East-
erns." Mulzet said, “because well
have a chance to get revenge."

Treasurer also won the three-
meter board. Mike McCalley came
close as he fell two points short 275-
273.

“I felt I dove consistently."
McCalley said. “but nothing really
sharp."

“We did not taper or rest at all for
this meet,“ Krug said. “We worked
hard on the weights. In my mind. we
want to be well prepared for the Big
East championships. then the East-
erns and. hopefully, put our foot in
the door nationally."

This week, the Panthers travel to
Cleveland State for their final dual-
meet test of the season. Pitt must
then prepare for the championship
portion ofthe season that starts Feb.
16 with the Big East conference meet
at Trees Hall.

“Everyone‘s fired up for the Big
East.” Luffey said in an attempt to
block out the defeat.

Sportlines

Colas nearly misses

Senior 1000-meter specialist Todd Colas placed second at the Bally-
Rosemont Invitational in Chicago, Illinois. Colas was the only colle-
giate in the race. His NCAA qualifying time of 2:21.86 was bettered
only by Mark Belger who ran a blistering time of 2:20.97. Colas ran a
personal best time. His former best time was recorded at the Big East
championships in 1983 when he was ranked llth in the world.

Pitt’s Roger Kingdom did not fare as well at the Wanamaker-
Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden. Kingdom placed fifth in
against a field considered to be one the all-time best. His time in the
finals was 7.35 while the winner of the 60-yard hurdle event was Greg
Foster. He broke the tape in 7.07. Kingdom's best time of the indoor
season thus far is 7.02. He ran it at the George Mason Christmas

Invitational.

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.

Pitts women’s swimming and diving
team (5-1) created quite a turbulence
in West Virginia by setting four pool
records in route to an 80-60 washing
of the Mountaineers on Saturday.

[)iverTrieia Schultz qualified for

the NCAA pre—qualifiers with a
246.6 score in the one-meter and
258.2 points in the three-meter.

“We could have made the score

anything we wanted,” said swim-
ming coach David Belowich. “l was
happy with our [performance]; we
were really aggressive. The medley
relay set the tone of the meet.”

Anchored by freshman Susan
Hickman, who recently qualified for

the NCAA trials in the 50-yard free-
style, Pitt dashed to a 7-0 lead by
winning the relay with a time of

l:50.59. Tracy Pfister, Wendy Mor-

gan and Denise Sedlacek swam the
firs; three legs.

Pitt’s success in a pool whose rela-

“We had a lot of consistent

swims,” Hickman said. “We were
more relaxed -- not slacking off. but
calmer. Mentally, [the slow pool]
had no effect. You ignore the nega-
tive and tack on to the positive.”

Hickman set two WV-U pool

records on Saturday, winning the
50-
times of 23.46 and 5l.88, respec-
tively. Stacey Moller took the ‘L000
freestyle in l0:29.84, and four events
later, he also won the 200 butterfly in

ment, according to Belowich.

thought we’d have some good com-
petition. I am extremely pleased
with our top three divers.“

Shultx, Jennifer Brown and Tricia
Ney took top honors in both the
one- and three-meter dives.

“The courage award goes to
[Ney],” said Krug. Ney is legally
deaf, and she dove with a cast on her’
finger, which she broke on the board
only last week.

Schultz was not overly impressed
with her own diving.

“This is the way it should be. l‘ve
done better. but it was OK,“ said
Schultz. “I do better at away games,
especially when there are separate
pools for diving. The water's
warmer.“

Cold water has not affected Hick-
man, who has long and short-term
goals.

“All year long, I think about
nationals." Hickman said. “Each
meet l ask myself, “Is this where I
want to be?” Its almost trial and
error the first year, but l’ve no
complaints.

“Each meet, the team as a whole
learns something. We’re like a fam-
ily. We have our differences, but we
work them out."

Climbing
Lady gymnasts set mark

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

MOR(iANT()WN.W.Va. The
Lady Panther gymnasts took a giant
step in establishing themselves as
one of the true contenders for the
Eastern championship as they
creamed host West Virginia l78.l—
l64.65.

‘‘I’m extremely happy with this
performance." Pitt coach l)onna
Sanft said Saturday. “I78 is an
excellent score. l know Ohio State
[the early-season favorite] hasn’t
gone over 179 yet.”

Pitt (3—l) had the top four all-
around scores. Senior Lisa Shirk
won the competition with a total of
36.85. Freshman Alisa Spector was
second (35.8), while seniors Babbie
Flock (35.65) and Karen Martin
(34.75) completed the scoring for
Pitt.

“I said before the season that we
had a shot to become a very solid
team if we don‘t have the injury
problems." Sanft said.

ln the opening event. the vault.
Pitt opened a two-point gap 44.45-
42.45. Shirk proved to be heads and
shoulders above all of the competi-
tion as she was awarded a 9.5 on her
first attempt. She decided against a
second try figuring it would not be
worth the risk of injury.

‘‘I‘m very pleased with my vault-
ing." Shirk said. “I added a lot of
new tricks to my routines today. and
things were pretty successful."

' Martin and Flock recorded marks
of 8.85 while Shari Retton received
an 8.8 for West Virginia.

In the parallel bars competition,
the ladies from Pittsburgh began to
provide the onlookers with proof
that their depth is composed ofqual-
ity. Four scores between 9.35 and 8.9
were definitely proof enough.

Shirk registered the 9.35. Sopho—
more Debbie I)abkowski was
second with a 9.0 mark, as Spector
and Flock received scores of 8.9.

“The team competition is great,‘
Spector said. “l’m trying to get all
my scores to count [top five scores in
each event comprise the team‘s
total]. Its great to participate on a
team where the competition to have
the scores count is this tough.“

On the balance beam, the Lady
Panthers lengthened their lead to
l2.l5 points. -

Spector had the high score in the
event, 9.l5. while Hock and Shirk
posted 8.9 scores.

“There’s a totally different pres-
sure on this season‘s team." Flock
said. “Last year. Karen [ Martin] and
I had to hit our routinesjust to make
the team look respectable. This sea-

9

son. we have to have it all together if

we just want to score.“

The ladies from Pitt waited until
the fourth and final event to post
three individual scores at or above
the 9.() mark. The team may well
have gained the competitive boost
from the boisterous cheering of the
Lady Panther swimming and diving
team. who moments before had dis-
mantled their Mountaineer foes.

Spector won the floor exercise
(9.25), and Shirk was second (9.l).

Both tried one of the most diffi-
cult tricks on the floor. lt is referred
to as the “double—back“ by gym-
nasts, and what it appears to the
reporter‘s eyes as is amazing.

At the end of a tumble run, which

is a series of flips and twists. the pi

gymnast attempts to complete two
full revolutions in mid—air.

Neither was totally successful, but
both were close.

“'l‘hat’s the first time l’ve tried it
since my freshman year." Shirk said.
“The judges give you a couple extra
[point] tenths for risk."

Hock received a 9.0 for her
“floor" routine. while Martin and
Kristy Pieters were awarded scores
of 8.7.

“It took me a while to get my head
together.” Flock said. “But l believe
l have the determination now. It
feels good to do well, but inside, I
know therc‘s still a lot of improving
to be done.“

Pitt‘s final team point total of
|78.l establishes a new school
record. This marks the third time in
four meets that the Lady Panthers
have rewritten the books.

“They did what we knew they
could from the start.“ Pitt assistant
coach Frank Klein said. “They did a
great job today. and they‘re gonna
continue to a betterjob as the season
progresses.“

Next weekend. the lady gymnasts
are off. but they resume their dual-
meet competition on Feb. l0 when
they visit Clarion.

Panther gymnasts
nip Golden Flashes

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

The Pitt men gymnasts
squeaked by Kent State 261.6-
2594 Friday evening at Trees
Hall.

The Panthers entered the meet
with the idea that the Golden
Flashes would pose little threat
to their unblemished record.

“The meet should not have
been this close.” Pitt coach
Frank D’Amico said. “We pulled
it out on the high bar [the last of
the six events]. They almost beat
us.

Pitt sophomore Mark Klafter
established a new school all-
around scoring record with
55. l 5. He broke his old record of
54.45.

He hit his routines well
throughout the meet. In the floor
exercise. he posted the highest
mark. 9.65. On the side horse. he
totalled 8.9. In the still rings. the
vault and the parallel bars com-
petitions. he went on to post
scores of 9.3. 8.85 and 9.15.
respectively.

He closed out his all-around
performance with a high bar rou-

exercise.

As the competition headed for
the pommel horse. Pitt managed
a second and a third from Klafter
and freshman Mike Mealie (8.7).
Ken Ruffer won the event for
Kent State with a score of 8.95.

With the Panthers trailing
85.85-85.7 after two events. the
still rings competition was next.

Pitt swept the top three spots
with Klafter and seniors Frank
Krat'1. (9.2) and Smith (8.85).

The vault was again too close
for Pitt‘s liking. Kratz and Smith
took first and second with 9.25
and 9.2. but two Golden Flashes
tied Matt Peters for third with
9.1.

Klafter. Peters (8.95) and
Smith (8.85) gave Pitt a one—two-
three sweep in the parallel bars.

The Panthers carried a slim .95
lead into the final event. It was
time to find out whether Kent
State was up to the task.

Smith answered the call and
posted a 9.35. which won the
event. Not far behind. Klafter
took second. A hoard tied for
third. Kratz and Kent State’s
Mark Jankovek, Greg Francis
and Lee Pluhowski posted scores
of 9.1.

Matt and Pat at it again

The Pitt News

66 P ,
AATRICK... PAATRICK
PAAtrick...PAAtrick...“

Like a frustrated mother waiting
to complete her dinner calls, a crowd
of some 7,000 Pitt fans called out to
the most recognizable seven feet of
basketball player in the land Satur-
day afternoon during Georgetown's
63-52 win.

The university’s public speaking
course requirement paid off ——
“PAAAtrick, PAAAt_rick,” ~-
although style rated above overall
content.

. They hoped for a response.
Instead, they got an explanation of
why Georgetown’s Patrick Ewing
may be the best non-salaried basket-
ball player in the world.

Ewing reacted with a game-high
20 ‘points. His only retaliation —-
nine points and his general restruc-
turing of the jump shot as Pitt
players knew it.

He so dominates a game that even
the Fitzgerald forensic section hated
to see him take a rest. An advertiser
might say, “A game without Patrick
is just another five on five."

Ewing also blocked five shots, but
that statistic pales alongside Pitt’s 37
percent shooting percentage.
Ewing’s presence instills in other-
wise accurate shooters a fear of

Early in the game, Pitt’s head
coach Roy Chipman sent out a def-
ensive bunker named Matthew Mik-
lasevich to try to distract Ewing, but
the designated-player move which
helped the Panthers upset Patrick
and the Hoyas last season did
neither on Saturday.

Down in the stomach of the Field
House, where players and press
gather after the game, the two games
— last years 65-63 Panther win and
this year’s Georgetown redemption
- and what might become known as
the Miklasevich move dominated
the discussion.

Georgetown head coach John
Thompson stood with a carton of
milk buried somewhere in his grip
and offered his appraisal.

“What’s his job?”
asked of the seldom-seen,6—7 Pitt
sophomore who in the past two
years has collected a lifetime full of
Ewing stories to share with his kids
or bar mates.

“Mainly, I'm a defensive player,"
Miklasevich said with a touch of the
understated. And the Tasmanian
Devil mainly likes to eat.

“He’s not a scorer, but he doesn’t
make mistakes,” Chipman said. “He
has been playing well in practice.

“Our problem is as much passing
as it is shooting,” Chipman con-
tinued, trying to build an argument.
“Miklasevich is probably the best
inside passer we have."

Miklasevich is also the one
Panther who would not hesitate at
the idea of running through brick
walls in practice.

Ewing and Miklasevich first met
last year at the Field House. Mik-
lasevich had undergone pre-game
hypnosis before draping himself

over Ewing’s back for half a game. H

Eventually, Ewing turned and
delived one of his patented “that is
enough" stares in the Pitt sopho-
more’s direction.

The two repeated their introduc-
tions Saturday, sans the hypnosis,
and again, Ewing took things into
his own eyes and hands.

“He hit me with an elbow to the
neck,” Miklasevich said, happy to
have lived to remember it. “He was
trying to stare me down."

Ewing feigned indifference.

“Who?” he asked when someone
mentioned Miklasevich.

Miklasevich took the battle a little
more personally.

“I just seem to have that effect on
people,” he said.

Ewing‘s effect on the Panthers
became most visible late in the
second half as he roamed out
beyond the key to peddle his defen-
sive wares.

“He made some blocks late in the
game that were crucial,” Thompson
said.

Ewing has been doing that since
he was freshman. Saturday, be
unveiled a shooting touch from I5
feet and beyond that surprised some
people.

“He’s much better offensively and
as a passer than he was last year,”
Chipman said, pressed to offer a new
superlative for Ewing.

“He picks the time to block a shot
now, he doesn‘t try to block every-
thing. He sure as hell was effective
today.”

The Panthers might be excused if
they misunderstood Ewing‘s desire
not to block everything.

“I went inside, and all I could see
was Ewing," said Pitt’s George
Allen.

Chipman thought briefly about
what Georgetown might be like
without him.

“If you took him out of the lineup
today, they would be an average
team,” Chipman said. “They would
need a year to develop a different
style.”

Fans around the Big East would
also need a year to develop another
cheer.

For now, “PAAAtrick" will do.

Hoyas

continued from page sixteen

“They hack the hell out of you,”
guard Billy Culbertson said. “But
that’s the breaks."

The first break in the game came
during the last three minutes of the
first half. Georgetown’s shifting
zone created problems for the
Panthers’ half-court offense. Several

times, Pitt held the ball for until thew

shot clock reached 10 and then
forced up shots.

“They were changing it up, com-
ing up on the ball,” Culbertson said.
“We took a couple bad shots and
made some dumb mistakes.”

Such mistakes can sometimes be
masked with a player of Ewing’s
caliber.

“If they didn’t have him and they
had a defense error, they’d give up a
score,” Chipman said. “A lot of what
he does inspires the other players.“

What the Panthers need now is a
little inspiration. A winless week
puts Pitt 2-5 in the Big East going
into Providence Wednesday night.

“We're not looking by the little
sisters of the poor,” Chipman said.
“We need a win badly.”

Karl Kobil/ 7719 Pitt News

Georgetown guard Gene Smith (22) eludes the trap set by Pitt’s Andre Williams (left) and George Allen. The Hoyas raised their record
to 16-2 with a 63-52 win Saturday.

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

It was like the game was being
replayed on a Betamax.

Here was Georgetown, nationally
ranked and highly respected with
seven high school All-Americas,
including seven-foot center Patrick
Ewing, losing a double-digit lead to
Pitt, a squad that's not as talented
but scrappy. And a full-house home
crowd doesn’t hurt.

When Clyde Vaughan hit a 20-
footer over the outstretched hand of
Ewing with 8:5l remaining, he
capped a run in which Pitt outscored
the Hoyas 9-2.

The 6,686 fans who piled into the

Breaking records I

The Lady Panther gymnastic team set a school
scoring record in Pitt's victory over West Virginia
Saturday in Morgantown ...page 9

Fitzgerald Field House saw sweet
visions of another Panther miracle.

But the story did not ring true this
year. The Hoyas, a year wiser and
more mature, held off Pitt’s rally,
defeating the Panthers 63-52 on Sat-
urday afternoon.

“This year, we still maintain a cer-
tain amount of composure when
teams make a run at us," George-
town head coach John Thompson
said. “The crowd got back into the

"game, but unlike last year, we were

able to maintain our composure. lt
was a game we would have lost last
year. We were proud of that."
Defense is what gave the win to
the Hoyas, stalling the Panthers’
momentum. After tying the game,
Georgetown’s harassing 2-1-2 full-
court press forced five consecutive

Pitt turnovers.

The first came on a freshman mis-
take. Guard Curtis Aiken, instead of
throwing over the pressure, attemp-
ted to dribble through it. The result,
a Hoya steal. '

Then Billy Culbertson tried a
three-quarter court pass to Vaughan
downcourt. The agile Ewing easily
picked off the aerial.

As a result ofa tie-up between Pitt
forward Andre Williams and
Georgetown forward Billy Martin,
which went to the Hoyas on alterna-
tive possession, a throwaway pass by
George Allen and an Ewing block on
Vaughan, the Hoya lead went to
eight with 5:44 left, leaving even less
time for Pitt to make another mira-
cle comeback.

“We could have been smarter with

the ball,” Panther head coach Roy
Chipman said, “but everything is
due to their defense."

Ewing deserves his part of the
credit. Primarily known for his de-
fensive skills rather than for his abil-
ity to put the ball into the hoops, the
junior center put together All-
America statistics across the board.
Ewing scored 20 points on eight-for-
ll shooting, nine rebounds and five
blocked shots. It was unlike last
year‘s encounter at Pitt, where
Ewing, intimidated by the rabid
Panther fans. scored ll points, three
in the second half.

Ewing was also responsible for
Vaughan‘s worst performance this
season. Vaughan missed 14 of his 20
shots from the floor, some of which
were deflected when the seven-foot

  Ewing, Ci’town maintain poise, 63-52

Hoya ventured outside the paint to
challenge Vaughan.

The 6-4 senior was held scoreless
for the first 13 minutes, ending the
drought when he converted a techni-
cal foul shot. The technical foul was
charged to Georgetown’s Reggie
Williams, who grabbed the rim
fighting for a rebound, _

“Patrick seemed to bother Clyde."
Chipman said. “He didn‘t play with
the same type of confidence.“

Neither did the Panther offense.
Pitt only shot 37 percent, some
which can be attributed to a team
shooting slump. but credit also must
be given to the aggressive George-

town defense, which had held oppo— S

nents to 39.3 percent from the field
this season before this game.

Calling, Mr. Ewing

The echo of Patrick rang clear in. the Fitzgerald
Field House as Georgetown's famed big man
made more than one impression on the Panther

basketball team....page 14
