Committee
Urges Rac.ial
Discussions A

Finding no discrimination
in overall University policy,
the University Human Rela-
tions Committee suggested
that personal prejudices can
best be combatted by educa-
tion through group discussions.

At a meeting of the committee
Wednesday, Jerry Whalen, head of
Men’s Housing, stressed that an
awareness of the eliccts of
dividual

in-
racial prejudices on a
is needed if
students want to take any positive

action.

University campus

A specific anea where discrimi-
nation was noted was in of’f—cam—
pus housing Whalen explained
that students may not realize that,
as head of men’s housing, he can
keep track of discrimination in
that area.

Renters Questioned

When prospective landlords call
the University, they are asked if
they will rent to any student, de-
spite race. color, or creed. Those
who will not are not placed on
the University’s list. Also, when
they find instances of discrimina-
tion. the University can notify the
Mayor’s Commission on Human
Relations, which can take the
proper legal steps if necessary.

lvhalen suggests that students
who have had anything to do
with oﬁ‘-campus housing and
have seen evidences of discrimi-
nation check with the University
list. that the University can re-
move names of renters who have
practiced discrimination.

He’ also suggested that the Uni-
versity check with mcn’s housing
at Carnegie Tech so that both
schools can compare their lists of
renters. T

Men’s Council Votes
To Revise Constitution

-In a twenty minute meeting last
Thursday, attended by six mem--
bers, Men’s Council decided to re-
vise their constitution next tri-
mester, to accept whatever de-
cision their commit.tee on continu-
ing the Student Book Exchange
reaches, and to hold no meeting
this week.

Present at the meeting
Steve Johnson——president, Charles
Lebovitz—vice president, Tom
Mellers, Jay Strunck, Dan John-
son. and Howard Soloman.

“Whatever Student Government
does in their re-organization, our
constitution is no longer ade-
quate.” MC president, Steve John-
son said. and he announced that
the Council would revise their
constitution next trimester.

Reporting on MC investigations
as to the advisability of taking

W€l'()I

over the Student Book Exchange
from SG, Howard Soloman called
the problem “so vital, that the MC

 

committee will discuss it with
each MC member.”

“I ‘think we can come to a
gentleman’s agreement to uphold
whatever action the committee
decides upon,” Johnson suggested.

Then the members present re-
viewed their plans for the new
trimester. Johnson called the con-
stitution revision necessary, “be-
cause we’ve built MC up to more
than it was before, so we need a
constitution which is more con-
crete. It must keep the number of
officers to a minimum. This will
make voting easy and will enable
MC to attract the type of student
who will work for the organi-
zation."

Other projects for the winter
trimester include a possible MC
-AWS dinner, preparation of a
list of typists for term papers,
preparation of alist of professors
willing to speak at fraternity pro-
grams, and a new IBM scored

 

questionnaire for students;

 

ing Hall on December 18, 19,

20, and 21 between 9 a.m.
8:30 p.m.

Mechanical Engineers may ob-
tain their kits on the same dates
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. in the
Mechanical Engineering Office,
201 Engineering Hall. After 5
p.m. their kits will be available in
508 Engineering Hall. -

Students Separate
vThe University has adopted a
“post-billing” system of registra-
tion beginning with the Winter
Trimester in order to alleviate the
difficulties of the students regis-
tering after the normal period.
In essence, it was decided that
“ﬂoor registration” be treated
as an extension of the present
invoicing system rather than
treating the two as separate

and

problems.
Students will be divided into
four categories and segregated

either in time, location, or both,
in order to limit the numbers in
the Commons Room.

These four groups are (1) un-
dergraduates, (2) graduates, (3)
General Studies students, and (4)
all invoiced and registered stu-
dents wishing to make a change
in their program.

Change Procedures Listed

Graduate students will complete
a Course Election Record with
their advisor and take it to 1817

tional Exchange, Amos Hall.

According to William Hosick,
chairman of the award committee,
prepar;.tions tor the selection of
the recipient of the $500 grant for
foreign travel and study are now
underway. ,

The award, which is given in
co—operation with the Internati -9-
al Association for Exchange of
Students for Technical Experi-
ence, will allow a junior or senior
Engineering student to spend the
summer of 1962 in travel and on-
the-job training abroad. 0

The winning applicant will be
selected on the basis . of his
QPA, industrial experience, Uni-
versity and civic activities, and
his desire to utilize the experi-
ences which he will gain in his
travels with his associates.

The eight men who will select
the EMITT awardee are William
Hosick, chairman and 1961 EMITT
winner; Bill Singleton, president

Ogden Nash

‘Harvard Sopli’
F1'igl1tc1'1ed by
College Audience

By JIM HUFNAGEL

“Poets aren’t very useful
because they aren’t very con-
sumeful or very produceful.”

Whether or not he has been 
useful, consumeful or pro- "
duceful, Ogden Nash has
been, at the very least, funnyful.
Anyone who has had even a pass-
ing acquaintance with him (and
who hasn’t‘.’) is aware of this —-
but University students discover- 
ed it all over again at Wednes-  
day’s Midday program where the
bard of contemporary doggerel re- ’
galed the biggest Midday crowd
since Senator Ke'nnedy’s visit.

In spite of a public address sys-
tem failure, Nash managed to ’
“Moo my very best.” After ex
plaining that “A diploma audi-
ence frightens me because I left

OCEE Aids ‘in Presenting

Roundtable Discussions

On African -

A roundtable discussion on
“Africa and America: Social and
Political Patterns” was presented
last Saturday by the University

« Office of Cultural and Education-

al Exchange in cooperation with
the Intercollegiate Regional Coun-
cil and the Pittsburgh Council for
International Visitors.

It’s purpose was to give stu-
dents from Sub—Saharan Africa
and the United States an oppor-
tunity to explore some of the dif-
ferences in the social and political
patterns of their respective so-

American Politics

The discussions were informal,
with no prepared statements or
lectures. Students were asked to

give their point of view on the
other group’s system at the be-
ginning of each session. Then the
group attempted a systematic an-
alysis of the subject. Participa-
tion was limited to 25 students.

“The Individual in African and
American Society” was discussed
in the morning, and “Political
Patterns in Sub—Saharan Africa
and the United States” in the
afternoon. ’

technically, I am still a sopho-
more at Harvard,” Nash began to
exlpain a few of the theories be-
hind his ludicrous limmericks.
“Although my work looks like
it was written in 30 seconds by
an idiot child, it is really a bit
more difficult that that. But ev-

erything I do has been said and
said better; I have been able to
support a family by saying the
same thing" and saying it worse.”

Peppering his presentation with
excerpts from his more famous
poems — “Marriage is more inter-
esting than divorce/’ because it’s
the only known meeting of. the
immovable object and the unre-
sisting force” and “Candy is
dandy/But liquor is quicker” ——
“the Portable Nash” considered
topics ranging from matrimony
and fatherhood to plagiarism and
travel.

About travel, he said, “It must
be evident by now that I am an
old fogey. One of my old fogey—
isms is that I consider that the
airplane, or more correctly the
ﬂying machine, is not here to
stay. This was one case when two t
Wrights made a wrong.” l

At the 3 p.m. coffee hour. Nash
attributed much of his inspira-
tion to apredilection for rephras- ‘
ing and updating the classics. As - F
example of this fondness he cit-
ed, “I think that I shall never
see./a Billboard as lovely as a.
tree/In fact unless the Billboard
fall/I may never see a tree at
all.” t

Even if he never does see a tree.
however, Nash will remain one of
the greatest poetic punnymen of
our day.

Must tomorrow's travelers resort to howdahs and

our Ford Motor Company scientists.

First—aslde trom the unlikely depletion of our
natural sources of gasollne—the prospects for
. higher-etﬁciency internal combustion engines

Second. while gasoline still appears the best con-
ceivable automotive tuel, our scientists are study-
ing the outlook for new energy sources for cars.

Among intriguing possibilities: new energy cone

version systems using degraded

fuels, or fuels

--synthesized from low—cost power produced by
nuclear fusion. Magneto-hydrodynamic gener-
ators and solid-state thermoelectric and electro-
chemical converters offer other possibilities.

This is all part of a broad quest for fundamental
knowledge, earning Ford its place of leadership
through scientiﬁc research and engineering.

Time For T es ts

The problem of scheduling exams‘ could easily be solved
by reinstituting a ﬁnal" exam week. As the system now
stands, the last two weeks of the term are crammed with
all manner of testing procedures. By returning to the old
system, each section would have itsown day of testing,
all in one week‘, with each test requiring a maximum of two
orthree hours for completion.

With the system as it is now, an hour in not enough
time to test a student in his comprehension of the course’s
total problem. The essay question must either be so broad
or so narrow that it loses it validity, for it is not an accu-
rate test either of the student’s understanding of the term
problem or of his ability to reason out a logical and readable
answer. The objective or true and false test does little more
to determine a student’s basic grasp [of the subject. Such
tests become, instead, the College Bowl test of quick recall

, and speed reactions.

For this reason, many professors have replaced the ﬁnal
with a major test which includes material from the mid-
term‘ or from the last test given. But the ﬁnal should do
more than test skill which covers only a half or a quarter
of the term. The exam should pool the units of learning
into a concrete whole which gives the student the total
picture and allows him to transpose the essentials of that
picture onto various situations and creating a new one

_ from it.

In the languages this would mean, at the very least, a
paragraph in English which must be translated into the
language being studied. The vocabulary of the student and
his ability to conjugate a verb will be easily discernible
in his ﬁnal product. ‘

The social sciences, also, could test a student’s knowl-
edge of speciﬁcs by presenting him with one or two prob-
lems in which he must transfer himself into a particular
situation or period in order to find the solution. And so it
should be in all areas of the University.

But, if the system is to be at all practical, the student
must be given an opportunity to collect his thoughts to
formulate a coherent and reasonable answer. It should not
be a race with the clock. A ﬁnals week of two to three hour
comprehensive exams, then, would best accomplish the aims
of an educative system.

Smoke Gets in My Lungs . . .

Idiot's Delight?

By Matthew Nesvisky

America is going up in smoke.

And we are doing absolutely nothing about it.
Indeed, we are smoking more cigarettes every
year. After we roll out of our bunks in the morn-
ing, we grope for our cigarettes before we even be-
gin to look for our clothes. And it seems that
breakfast is no longer really a
breakfast without a smoke be-
tween each segment of our
grapefruit. And the hand which ,_ ‘
holds a cup of coffee without a
smoldering stick between its
knuckles is a rarity these days. A

Smoking has become an in-
tegral part of our American way
of life; we just cannot seem to
live without the after-dinner A
cigarette, the after-class cigar- 
ette, the after-movie cigarette,
the after—bus ride cigarette or, in too many cases,
the after—cigarette cigarette. ‘

Oh, I know that a few non—smokers do exist in
the United States, but this is because they prob-
ably do not have the $90 to $165 which the average
puffer “burns” annually.

But our number of non-smokers is overwhelm-
ingly surpassed by the number of people who do
indulge. As a yard—stick of the popularity of to-
bacco, one only has to consider the amount of ash-
trays to be found in this country.oThink about it
for a moment. With the possible exception of the
ﬂoor of a swimming pool, ashtrays are just about
everywhere. Locate a home, car, theatre, opera
house, restaurant, bar, museum or bowling alley
that has no ashtray and I would bet Mr. Barnum
would be begging to buy it.

Why? Why? Why?

So it has been established that the greater ma-
jority of us smoke, and smoke a good deal. The
question which logically occurs is: Why? Why, for
God’s sake, do we do it?

With heads lowered in reverence, we can turn
to the omniscient Madison Avenue advertising ex-
ecutives for an answer. They know everything.
But the Madmen’s messages reveal to. us only one

.thing:~we smoke ‘for the flavor. Flavor! Would

somebody please tell me what the hell kind of
flavor there is in a cigarette? Vanilla? Chocolate?
Thyme? Not in my cigarette, buddy. ‘After a hard

 

day of chain smoking over -a hot typewriter, the
only ﬂavor that I can taste is something akin to
having had the entire Russian Army walk bare-
footed over my tongue. I’

So if we cannot determine the reason for smok-
ing with the aid of the cigarette salesmen, perhaps
it is time to look at the object itself.

Cigarettes are white-papered tubes ﬁlled with
shredded, toasted tobacco (Virginius Irritationus),
They are affectionately known as smokes, butts,
fags, weeds, coﬁin nails, chokers, cancer sticks and

clinic keys. They may be purchased by the package’,

(often called deck or herd), or by the carton, or
by the case, or by the lung ward. "

.As noted, the main part of the cigarette is the 

tobacco, which was King Cotton in the South until
cotton came along. Tobacco has only one use: it

smoulders when ignited. And as it would be rather‘,

silly to purchase a product for the purpose of
watching it smoulder, it is only logical that we
should wrap it up in paper, place it between our
lips and inhale the Smoke. , I
Magical Inhalation

And what happens when we inhale that smoke?
Ah, there is the true magic. of smoking! We feel
the rich clouds rolling across our tongues. We feel

the billows of relaxation spill into our lungs. We"

feel the assuring, womby warmth elevate our spir-
its. And we feel sick and we cough until our
throats practically invert themselves.

This is not to ‘say, however, that smoking is an
idiotic practice. For one must not overlook the so-
cial values of the habit. How else, for example,
could thirteen-year—old boys create a “tough” ap-
pearance? And how else. could a freshmenette
prove herself sophisticated enough to be sorority
material if she had no cigarette to wave, even
though she holds it as if it were a jelly doughnut?
And I submit that Frank Sinatra would not enjoy
half of the popularity which he does it he crooned
while holding a lollipop, for instance, rather than
a Chesterfield.

So it can be seen, therefore, that smoking is not
really a senseless custom. It keeps the little hoods
of tomorrow secure. It keeps the sorority sisters of
next term secure. It keeps the Sinatra fans secure.
And it keeps the lung specialists secure.

And it is just about time for our after—column
cigarette. Everybody ready‘? Set‘? Start coughing!

O'Brien's Work Found Good, Good, Good

Editor, The Pitt News,

The defenses of Mr. Jim O’Brien’s columns in
your December fourth issue of The Pitt News are
most able, but since quantity of noise exerts more
pressure upon most of us than quality of thought,

I want to add my own praises just as loudly as I.

can.

THE COLUMNS ARE GOOD! Mr. O’Brien not
only shows a gittof style ~—— without cliche, with-
out the sophomoric witticisms by which many
sportswriters maintain interest —— but he manages
to say something interesting about sports and the
people who engage in them.

Sports lovers who object to the honesty of re-
portorial viewpoint achieved by direct quotation

and other objective techniques should remember
that they can’t.love their sport unless they know
her, and that she is not entirely composed of touch-
downs. A

“M. C.” remarked that it was perhaps a sad
commentary on sports writing in general that Mr.
O’Brien’s writing excelled what is being done in
the downtown papers.

It is also a sad commentary on University life
that it cannot apparently provide the audience for
such writing as this.

THE COLUMNS ARE GOOD!

They are probably toogood.

Student Avoids Chapel

Because Of Messages
Editor, The Pitt. News,

In a recent editioniof The Pitt
News, “An Interested Student”

commented on the poor atten-
dance at
Service. Religion means very
much to me, but I -no longer
regularly attend the Chapel be-
cause I do not agree with the
letter writer about the inspira-
tional ministers.

If it would be the polite thing
to do, I would come to the
Chapel for the inspiration and
calming effect of the excellent
music in the very beautiful set-
ting and then leave before the
messages which are as appro-
priate to the setting as a pea-
nut vendor would be at one of
the Convocations.

These Services are supposed to
be Christian services, but the
ministers do not deliver Chris-
tian .do»ctrines, but secular ones.

the Tuesday Chapel

The fundamental Christian doc-
trines can be preached, without
being denominational in char-
acter as C. S. Lewis has done
so excellently in his book, Mere
Christianity.

I remember one message de-
livered at the Chapel when the

— references to Christ did not seem

to belong in the message and
were only present to keep up
appearances.

These speakers seem to have
no convictions and to be trying
to give a message to which even
an atheist could agree‘.

Yes, on my part it is a lack of
interest in a weak, watered-
down message with the claim of

»» being Christian.

Transfer Student Says

Fencing Team Needed
Editor, The Pitt News,

One of the most beautiful and

. enjoyable sports that I have ever

seen or had the good fortune to
take part in is fencing. Why
there isn’t a team in a Univer-
sity as large as this one is be-
yond my comprehension.“

As a transfer student from a
smaller college in New York, I
can attest to the popularity of
fencing as a spectator sport
among many of our largest East-
ern institutions.» '

I have observed that our Pitt
Fencing Club consists of en-
thusiastic members, but they
must operate without instruc-
tion from the University and
only with the materials which

they can muster for themselves.

The sponsorship of a fencing
team would assist these indivi-
duals and at the same time give
a fresh, exciting spectator sport

to all interested students.

Printing Service Provides Forms,”

Diplomas, Signs, But NOT EXIIIS

By MATT SWETONIC

From. application forms to
graduation diplomas, it is the
University Printing Service
that supplies the printed ma-
terial so necessary to the
running of a large University.

In fact. many of the University
organization.s" could not possibly
carry on their activities without
the assistance of the personnel
and xnachines which occupy the
two story lll‘l(_‘l( l.mil<ling on Sen»-
atc Street.

The 16 people who work for
the Printing‘ Service do the vast
majority of the pr.inting. dupli-
cating and mimeographing with-
out which the University would
be a voice without words.

Obtains Mailer

Although the task of printing
up examinations is no longer

handled by the Service; brochures

for Public Relations, thesis for the
Graduate. Schools, all manners of
books for the various depart-

'ments, and signs for around cam-

pus are among the many print-
ing: jobs handled  a part of the
Services activities.

At‘ the present time. they are p

in the process of printing upl

5.000 announcements and 50,000

attaclied applications for a

Teaching Internship to be spon-

sored by the Public; Relations

department. 0

The Service is also printing
55,000 letters for the Alumni As-
sociation which are to be address-
ed by a revolutionary new ma-
chine called the Cheshire Mailer
which can handle 16,000 letters
an hour instead of the previous
2,000 by the old method.

Costs Thousands

The mailer. which cost: approxi-
mately $8.000. makes use of IBM
cards to attach addressed labels to
the envelopes.

This will make obsolete the
vast filing‘ cabinet which was
formerly necessary in order to
hold the nearly 100,000 nfetal
plates which contained the ad-
dresses of University personnel.

The Service handles approxi-
mately $7:3(),000 worth of business
a year.

Of this amount. $350,000 is
handled by the shop on Senate
Street and the rest is alloted to
larger concerns which have spec-
ialized equipment that the Uni-
versity Service lacks.

College Queens make
great discovery inNew York!

Of course, they loved the city——the fun and the excitement.
But they also learned about diamond rings-discovered there
is a way to be sure of the diamond you buy. They saw how
Artcarved guarantees every diamond in writing for color,
cut, clarity and carat weight. They were impressed by the
proof of value offered by Artcarved's nationally-advertised
Permanent V aluc Plan, hacked by the quality reputation of
this 110 year old firm. And, they were most delighted with
Artcarved’s magniﬁcent assortment of awardwinning styles.

Visit your local Artcarved jeweler and see all the wooden

In his message to the E & ‘M

great need in the Latin American
Nations for engineers, quoting
Rostow‘s “Stages of Economic
Growth” to underscore the need.
He suggests how thisAUniversity
could help develop engineers for
these nations.

Kenneth E. Weber, an E.E.
freshman, and Bob Lisce, an

merical controls, electronic de-
vices used to control machines
by using punched tapes. They
explain how the devices work~
and their savings to industry in
time and money.

A Ch. E. sophomore who is also
interested in amateur rocketry,
James Falk, explains the varied
uses of ﬂuorocarbons, their limita-
tions and outstanding character-
istics.

Two articles cover EMITT, a

Arts Director
Begins Talks

On Exhibits
Gordon B. \Va'shl)urn
Initiates Lectures

On ‘Pgh. International’

Gordon Bailey Washburn,
Fine Arts Director of Car-
negie Institute, has begun a
series of lectures, “Enjoying
the International” free to the
public at Carnegie Lecture
Hall. The slide talks started last
Thursday and will continue until
January '7.

“New records for attendance . . .
have indicated suchbroad inter-
est :in the exhibition that I am
delighted to discuss the exhibition
again,” said Washburn, who has
previously given a series of three
lectures on the 1961 Pittsburgh
International Exhibition of Con-
temporary Painting and Sculpture.

Washburn called the exhibition
both a presentation of “artists of
talent whom we have known over
the years” and a breaking of new
ground which introduces “new
figures who promise to be im-
portant in the future.”

“I am happy to see how many
visitors return again and again to
enrich their knowledge and ex-
perience of the works that are‘ex-
hibited," he continued. “One can

scarcely become acquainted with \

a show of this size in two months.
We are one of the -most fortunate
cities in the world in being able
to have the world's art of our time
here." '
The slide talks are co—sponsored
by the Women's Committee and
its Junior Council. of the Fine Arts
Department, Carnegie Institute.
They are held in Carnegie Lecture
Hall and begin at 8:30 pm. The
International is open at Carnegie
Institute from 10 a.m. to 10 pm.
weekdays. and from 2 until 5 pm.
Sundays through January 7, 1962.

will then be processed like normal
registration.

Students wishing to make a
change in their program will
first see their advisor to com-
plete a Course Election Change
request after which they will
comeoto the “change area” of
procure a new class card or
the Commons Room in order to
have any old cards made over.

They will then secure a term
card Change-in-Course set. When
this has been done the student
will then go to the casliier-‘s area
to make such} ﬁnancial adjust-
ments as may be necessary.

The school of General Studies
will follow essentially the same
pattern as is now in effect for
them. ‘

A late registration fee will be
charged to all students initiating
registration on January 2. with
the exception of new or readmit-
ted students and students in the
School of General Studies.

   

Invoices Streamlined

The invoices will be delivered
to the dean’s offices on January 3
for distribution to the students,
or will be mailed to the students
as the various deans prefer.

A course may be added up to
January 13, and the last date on
which it may be dropped is
January 27. Changes should be
completed during these two pe-
riods rather than January 2.

The chief benefits to be deriv-
ed from the adoption of the above
procedure are two: first, it should
materially relieve the pressure on
the Commons Room, eliminating
masses of students from any need
to appear there for more than a
few minutes,.and second, it should
provide all students with one in-
voice for use in the library, ath-
letic department and others.

As of last Thursday there were
still 973 graduate ‘registrations and
1,400 undergraduate registrations
outstanding.

The world of entertainment may seem somewhat spe»- ’

cial, but it’s a case in point. These days, it demands more
of its people than ever before. ’Foday’s musical comedy
score is often as sophisticated as grand opera. Drama
draws heavily on psychology and history. Television pro-
ductions are concerned with nuclear science and political
science. If you’ve ever watched ‘Omnibus’ you may have
seen how our productions have run the gamut of a wide

range of man’s interests.

So I suggest to you that even though you may’ concen-
trate on one special field of interest, keep your viewpoint
broad. Keep your college curriculum as diversified as pos-
sible. Attend lectures and concerts, the theatres and mu-
seums. Above all, read and read, and listen and listen!
But pay scant heed to the oracle who says there’s no route

~“i|’r Goes On..."

FACE TO FACE ‘WITH A DEADPAN

I shoved back the grey door of the Ohio State dressing room, and
slid into the privacy of the No. 1 basketball team in the country. To
my left, draped across a wooden chair were the size 14 shoes of Jerry
Lucas. 9

Draped across his shoulders was a damp towel; in his hand was
half a bottle of Coke. He raised his deadpan face toward me.

Congratulations, Jeer,” I said, grasping his big hand with a
firm handshake, which almost prevented this story from being
written in the first person.

“Thank you, Mr. O’Brien,” he acknowledged my greeting.”

“. . . Mr. O’.Brien. Why l’ve only met the man once,” I thought.
“And he remembers my name. How about that . . .” A

Lucas had just scored 23 points against Pitt in a 99-79 win, but
he had moved so gracefully up and down the court, scored so effort-
lessly, and had been rested so often, that people were wondering aloud
just how great he can be. In the ﬁrst half, his shooting presence was

E hardly perceptible.

“Jcer, why did you have such a had first half,°’ﬂ I said, bracing
my leg on the bench which he was sitting on.

“[l?i_.<;‘lit here!" he said, pointing a ﬁnger toward his right knee.

“That caused all my trouble.” Then Lucas removed an elastic knee

b§:irl(l}\},,"0,, revealing a reddcncd knee cap which looked like a steak

(lone rare. '

Had Shots In Knee

"l <lidu‘t even think that I was going to play ball tonight,” Lucas
said. "I had a shot of cortisone in my knee Tuesday morning.”

“I have inﬂamed knees, ﬂuid from cells runs around in there,”
Lucas explained, directing our attention. to his mueh—publicizcd

anatomy. "I have something called ‘synovitis’.”

“Didn‘t your bad knees almost keep you ofi the Olympic squad a
few years ago." another reporter asked him.
,,_,» “. . . What a stupid qu.(’sti.())I,” I tlzouglzt. “He lcnows damn well
the mz.s"u~c'r is yes. He read it in a spo1'l.s magazi-he . . .”
Lucas merely nodded his head.

“How had were your knees lOl1i§.-’-'ht'?’, I inquired Of LUCEIS,
speaking in hushed tones. somewhat disturbed by the press con-
ference atmosphere as other writers around me poised their pens.

“They were stiff and weak," he replied. “The pain was worse to-

night than it’s ever been in my life." i

“C. . . Jccr. I wished you wou.ld'n't tall: so loud and clear. I don’t
uvant these other guys to get this stuff . . .” A
“Hey, Leroy," Lucas called to a manager, “get me another Coke.”

“Pardon me, fellas," a gent, whom I know to be a million-
aire alumnus of Ohio State from Mt. Lebanon, said, edging his
way toward Lucas.

“Jerry,” he says, “I want you to meet Bob Bennett, a local bas-
ketball player and Tom Trelhcway. a line swiimner." ~
»..r\Recrui+ing Race On

Two wide-eyed Ohio State prospects step forward, shake Lucas’
hand, and half. the recruiting battle is over if their joyous expres-
sions meant anything‘.

“Be glad to have you both come out and see our school,” Lucas,
the ambassador. said. '

“Jeer,” I said, trying to ignite another cross-examination, “Jeer.”

“Mr. Lucas, Mr. Lucas," 21 tall. awkward—looking hayseed
character burst into our midst, “I‘m from Columbus, my daddy
used to be the mayor there.”

“I want you to meet,” he said,

A tiny—-about five foot Indian gentleman — with a Ch8StI1Ut

preaching Lucas. “This is Zsa Zsa G-aborslamb (at least that’s what
it sounded like),” the ex-1nay(>i"s son said.

A poet once scrawled,
“We’re poor little sheep who

have lost our way, baa, baa,

baa.” His editor should have
assigned him to cover the
Pitt-Carnegie Tech basketball
game Saturday night. His lead
could have been: “We’re poor lit-
tle teams who didn’t come to play,
boo, boo, boo.”

those subs in there and get them
some experience.”

It appeared that the Panthers

There was only one team in
the country last year —— Cin-

Cat Quick

Jinks wasn‘t the only darling
to capture the hearts of the Pitt

Brian Generalovich awed the

the second largest ever to see
Pitt this year, with his. strength

If computers process data in mathematical terms,’how
can they be instructed to handle information and ap-

cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, is‘ fihding some
answers through research in automatic language

us a great deal about information processing. An idio-

the sum of its individual words, and a system that mere-

It. One solution is an "expanded electronic dictionary"
that contains idioms and grammatical instructions as
well as single words. Work is now under way-to clarify
meaning further by automatic syntactical analysis.

FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA

America is a great country. Ame1'ica’s cities are full of houses.
Americz1t's forests are full of trees. America’s rivers are full of
water. But it is not houses and trees and water that make
America great; it is curiosity~—the const-ant. quest to ﬁnd
answers—the endless, restless “Why?” “Why'?" “Why?”.

Therefore, when I vvzis told that Marlboro was it top seller
at colleges from USU to _Yale, I vvas not content merely to
accept this gmtifyiiig fact, I had to ﬁnd out why.

I hicd Iny.-‘ell to campu;-ies in every sector of this mi,<_{hty land.
First, I went to the Ivy I.e:1g\1e«—dressed, of course, in an
appropriate costume: :1 skull-aud—bones in one hand, a tria.ng'le
in the other, a ma..<k—and—\vig on my head, a lmsty pudding in
my chops. “Sir,” I cried, seizing an Ivy .l:6tlg'll€‘I‘ by the lapels,
which is no mean task considering the I1a1'rownes-s of Ivy League
lapels, but, I, fortunately, happen to have little tiny hands; in

fact, I spent the last War working in a small arms plant where, I I

am proud to say, I was awarded a Navy “E” for excellence and
won many friends-“Sir,” I cried, seizing an Ivy l.e:1guer by the
lapcls, “how come Marlboro is your favorite ﬁlter cigaret-he?"

“I’m glad you asked that question, Shorty,” he replied.
“Marlboro is my favorite ﬁlter cigarette because it is the ﬁlter
cigarette with the unﬁltered taste."

“Oh, thank you, sir!” I cried and ran posthaste to several
campuses in the Big Ten, wearing, of course, the appropriate
cost-ume: a plaid Mackinaw, birling boots, 3. Kodiak bear and
frost-bitten ears.

Spying an apple-checked young coed, I tugged my forelock
and said, “Excuse me, miss, but how come »Ma.rlboro is your
favorite ﬁlter cigarette?” '

“I’m glad you asked that question, Shorty," she replied.
“Marlboro is my favorite ﬁlter cigarette because the ﬂavor is
ﬂavorful, the ﬂip-top box ﬂips and the soft-pack is soft."

“Oh, thank you, apple-checked young coed," I cried and
bobbed a curtsey and sped as fast as my little fat legs. would
carry me to several campuses in the Southwest, wearing,.of
course, the appropriate costume: chaps, canteen, and several oil
leases. Spying a group of undergraduates singing “Strawberry
Roan,”- I removed my hat and said, “Excuse me, friends, but
why is Marlboro your favorite ﬁlter cigarette?”

“We are glad youasked that question, Shorty,” they replied.
“Marlboro is our favorite ﬁlter cigarette because we, native sons
and daughters of the wide open spaces, want a cigarette that is
frank and forthright and honest. We want, in short, Marlboro}!

“Oh, thank you, all,” I cried and, donning a muu muu, I set
sail for Hawaii, because in Hawaii, as in every state where Old
Glory ﬂies, Marlboro is the leading seller in ﬂip-top box, On
campus, off campus, in all ﬁfty states, wherever people smoke for
pleasure in this great land of ours, you will ﬁnd Marlboro.
