“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism ”

Vol. 72, No.30

By RICH HARRY
Pin News Staff Writer

At least 200 Pitt students will
embark for a student rally in
Harrisburg tomorrow to protest the
State’s delay in funding its four
ﬁnancially strapped state-related
universities. V

The Student Government Board,
in a special meeting Friday,
approved some $2,500 in travel
funds for the lobby headed by the
Student Government Task Force on
Higher Education.

The SGB’s 4-2 vote will allow
Pitt’s delegation to meet with other

‘ student lobbyists to respond to the
‘Legislature's funding impasse,

which has led to growing financial

hardship at Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln universities.

“This will be the only chance for
students to have any input before
the budget decision goes one way
or the other,” task force co-chair-
man Ed Bowers said of the rally.
“It'll pressure the Legislature to
resolve the issue as quickly as
possible." '

“We won't put up with the
closing of Temple before we take
action,” added task force co-chair-
man Kathy McCauley.

There were strong indications
before Friday that the SGB vote
would be narrow—three members
said they would vote against it and
one said he could be persuaded

Pitt Problems Priority,
Payne Tells Coalition

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pill News Staff Writer _

Pitt’s students should direct
their energies toward solving the
appropriations crisis in Harrisburg
ﬁrst, and not the Kent State
controversy, according to opinions
expressed by Student Government
Board members at their meeting

é-‘Wednesday. -

Representatives of the May 4th
Coalition criticised the board for

 not taking a stronger stand on the

Kent State issue.
President Bernie Payne asserted
the board must first confront

‘ problems that have a direct

influence on Pitt before venturing
into other areas.

“It is important that we set
priorities in what we are going to
do,” Payne said. “I think the
Harrisburg situation needs to be a
priority over the May 4th Coalition.
Idon’t mean to invalidate or to play

 

validity of the May 4th Coalition.

The Harrisburg situation is just

more important right now.”
Board member Chip Hubbard

‘ agreed.

“We are having enough pro-
blems mobilizing people to go to
Harrisburg,” Hubbard. said.
“Let’s clean up our own backyard
before we go off on, somebody
else’s regardless of how much we

support them,” he said.

The board approved a statement
written by board member Josh
Baylson supporting the student
body of Kent State in its struggle
against the administration over a
proposed gym site.

“Be it resolved this 9th day of
November, 1977.” the statement
reads, “that the Student Govern-
ment Board of the University of
Pittsburgh supports the aspirations
of our fellow students at Kent State

to—but the request passed easily,
with no modiﬁcation and after only
little deliberation.

SGB member Dave Hesidence
alone voiced diss_ent against the
request, saying the rally is the
“wrong move at the wrong time.”

However, Hesidence lauded the
efforts of the Task Force, and said
he would support any final decision
handed down by the board. He
added:

“l’ll be there like everybody
else."

All seven board members are
expected to be with the six-bus
caravan when_ it leaves the Bigelow
Avenue side of the Student Union
at 7:30 tomorrow morning.

Students are scheduled to arrive
before noon at the Capitol campus
of Penn State, where they will leave
for nearby Harrisburg with other
student lobbyists and a police
motorcade.

A The lobbyists will rally on the
Capitol steps while the Legislature
is in session, until about 2 p.m.
They will distribute to representa-
tives letters and petitions from
their constituents.

Pitt’s administration has rejected

a request to allow ofﬁcial leaves of

absence to student lobbyists, but

CAS Requirements Reviewed

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Changes in the College of Arts
and Sciences distribution of studies
(DOS) requirement dominated
discussion at last we_,ek’s meeting of
the College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) Council.

Pitt students presently are
required to take three courses in
each of the these divisions: natural
science, humanities and social
science. '

Citing the need for a change in
the current structure of the
distribution of studies requirement,
CAS Dean Robert Marshall said an
ad hoc committee, formed last
winter, has studied the present
strucuture of course distribution.

‘ ‘The distribution of studies is the
one existing curriculum require-

ment we have,” Marshall told
council members. “The dominant
thrust of the committee right now is
distrubution requirement. One
proposal introduced by committee
members dealt with departmental
courses numbered in the 80’s.

Citing students’ dependence on
80’s courses to fulﬁll course
distribution requirements, the com-
mittee said it will review current
80’s courses for their value, and will
develop additional 80-numbered
courses in all departments.

“The defects of the current
structure of the course distribution
program are too large,” committee
member Irwin Schulman said.
“The distribution of courses has
to get interaction between the
departments of the College of Arts
and Science.”

The committee introduced its
report, which included several
proposals that could change the
current structure of the course
degenerated into mere recruiting
grounds. A disproportionate
number are taught by graduate
teaching assistants. '

“This is only a mild proposal,”
Schulman said of the report. “We
can ’t predict how it will work. But it
is a constructive beginning.”

The report also includes plans for
the eventual development of a
standing committee to develop and
oversee the distribution require-
ment, the implementation of more
freshman seminars and a two-stage
distribution requirements that
would require the CAS students to

'p take at least nine credits in one
department outside major.

Temple Faculty

 

 SG OKs Lobby Funds;

May Not be Paid

With its state appropriation
gathering moss in the legislature,
Temple University faculty now face
the ultimate test of loyalty.

Will they stay on the job past
mid-December when Temple‘s last
nickel falls out of its pockets‘?

James D. Logan. Temple's vice
president for ﬁnancial affairs.
warned the university's 5,900
faculty and staff emplo_ves last
month that they won’t see a
paycheck in December unless
lawmakers free Temple's $66
million slice of the state's higher
education appropriation.

If needed. he said the university
would issue scrip. a type of
promissorynote, until state money
is forthcoming.

Temple’s education faculty voted
Wednesday to table a proposal to
close the university Dec. 1 if the
approoriation has not been passed.

Task force members also ex-

"I will consider the lobby a
failure." Payne said. “ifthere 15 no
media coverage. and if the people
of Penns_vlvania fail to talk about
the rally."

Asked what he would consider to
be a successful lobby. Bowers
replied. “Just getting this many
people from all the schools shows it
to be a success. Previous efforts
were disjointed."

Both Payne and Bowers expres-

‘ sed doubt that the rally. designed

as _"peaceful." would be marred by
outbreaks of radical behavior.
They noted police and student
marshall teams will be posted
throughout the crowd.

'‘I don't see any organized
radical movement trying to use the
lobby to further its cause." Payne
said. "I don't think they'd allow
it."

The rally will be followed by
continued letter-writing and lobby-
ing by student representatives.

“We urge all parties involved

University to strive with all
conceivable diligence to resolve
this matter peacefully and equi-

Representatives of the May 4th

against the language of the
statement, declaring it is not bold
enough in its failure to condemn
the Kent State Administration.

Hubbard defended the state-
ment.

“We know how much support we
can give." he said. “and that is
what this statement says. Most of
the members of the board are not in
favor of what the administration
has done at Kent State, but W€.t,.,.,o

we can do. Once Harrisburg is over
with maybe we can turn to this

Bernie Payne says
Harrisburg will be a failure if it

doesn’t get adequate media coverage and doesn’t set people to

talking.

We agree—we only hope it doesn’t become a topic of interest for
the wrongreasons. If the rally were to break down into violence or
confusion, it could only be counter-productive.

Tomorrow’s demonstration is serious business. Last Friday, the
Student Government Board rose to the occasion by approving tran-

sportation funding. Since the Un

iversity’s official lobbying process

has failed to drag “non-preferred’? appropriations out of the

legislature perhaps the Administr

to draw a crowd of 3,000—in-

cluding over 200 Pitt students—and it should give the legislators

cause to sit up and take notice.

Security precautions have been

arranged to ensure the rally is a peaceful one. Still, we feel the im-
portance of “keeping in line” cannot be over-emphasized. The
legislators have shown that, if given any opportunity whatsoever,
they can effectively write-off any individual or group that tries to
prod them out of their budgetary stupor. A disorderly demon-
stration would give them just that opportunity.

Dow and Precedent

Dow Chemical Corporation’s disenchantment with Jane Fonda’s
denunciations of American capitalism had some interesting——and

significant——results last week.

Dow’s decision to cut off con-

i'fiB'titi6‘r'i§ t6 Cétltfal Michigan University after an appearance by

the activist actress there raises

the question of whether Dow’s

commitment is to higher education or only to the promotion of its

own point of view.
organization here——The Pitt

More important, what if some campus
News, for instance—found it,

necessary to criticize one of the major contributors to this Univer-

sity?

We feel the Dow decision sets a dangerous precedent.

Apathy Leads To Activism

As I read the latest about
developments and the downhill
slide of the crisis facing Pitt and
other state institutions, I can’t help
but remember the letter from
Chancellor Posvar I received last
summer. It contained a list of state
‘representatives and senators and a
statement of concern urging me to
write these state officials to support
the appropriations bill and a
no-hike tuition policy for Pitt. Like
many of myifellow students, I put
this “waste of paper” in the
garbage. “What good would it
do?" I asked. “Anyway, I’m a
lousy typist.” And now, here I am,
no less interested in continuing my
education at Pitt, but deﬁnitely less
apathetic. Ican’t help but think if a
little more paper had been

“wasted” (on my part), maybe a
lot of time and money could have
been saved by all involved’in the
effort to obtain the appropriations.
I am teaching part-time and
going to Pitt part-time, but if I can
take time from my job on Tuesday
to go to Harrisburg, I'll go and
work for the nine stitches I might
have saved last summer. I ask the
faculty to support this effort by
excusing students from classes
Tuesday to show their concern for
Pitt and for their jobs. Regardless
of faculty support, if I can, I’m
going. i
Goodbye

New Distribution Requirement Questioned

Presently, the CAS Council has
before it a proposal to change the
distribution of studies require-
ment. The DOS requirement is
actually the only requirement in
CAS. As a result, Dean Robert
Marshall asked the ad hoc
committee on the Distribution of
Studies Requirement to study the
state of the current DOS require-
ment and its, relationship to the
goals of the Freshman Seminar
Program. The Committee was to
then submit a proposal to CAS
Council for deliberations.

In its report, the committee
identiﬁed a number of problems
with the current DOS requirement.
First of all, since students are
permitted to use virtually any
course in CAS to complete their
requirement, neither students nor
faculty have a coherent sense of
purpose. Many students don’t
even know what the DOS require-
ment is. It was intended to give
students a broad, well rounded
liberal arts education, but, because
of a lack of focus and coherence, it
hasn’t completely succeeded.

The DOS requirement was
originally intended to be fulﬁlled
"by courses in the 80’s and 180's.
Unfortunately, different depart-
ments had different ideas as to the
kind of courses needed by
non-majors. This had led to ‘a lack
of common purpose between
departments and the 80’s and 180's
courses they offered. The‘

“ non-major is thus given little of the ’
inter-relatedness _

sense of the
among the ﬁelds of study. A few
departments use 80’s courses to
serve as both an introductory

Reader Charges ‘Atwood’

course for majors and as a DOS
course for non-majors.

The ad hoc committee also
pointed out that many of the 80’s
courses have become large lectures
relying on graduate students for
instruction. This seems to indicate
a maldistribution of University
resources that favors graduate and
advanced undergraduate students
at the expense of freshmen and
sophomores. In some depart-
ments, there has been virtually no
attempt to provide non-majors with

- any moderately advanced instruc-
tion.

After pointing out these prob-
lems associated with the present
DOS requirement, the ad hoc
committee submitted its recom-
mendations to the CAS Council.
The following is a summary of
these recommendations:

1. The dean of CAS will set up a
committee of faculty and students
responsible for developing and
overviewing the DOS requirement.

2. The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences shall offer at least 40
Freshman Seminars per term.
They should remain limited to 20
students, and strongly recom-
mended rather than required.

3. CAS students will be required
to satisfy a two-stage DOS
requirement. They must complete
nine credits in each of the 3
divisions of the College.
nine credits per division must be
spread over 3 departments (this is
the present DOS requirement).
They» must then take 6 additional
credits in one of the departments

they have taken a previous DOS-

These I

course in. This department milst be
out of their major division.

4. DOS ﬁrst-stage requirement
(see above) may be satisﬁed by any
course recognized by the DOS
committee as appropriate. DOS
second-stage requirements may be
satisﬁed by any departmental

courses. although a sequence is

recommended. '

5. The DOS committee shall
define the purposes and rationale
of DOS. They will encourage
individual departments as well as
the division councils to identify
DOS courses.

Finally, tit‘
committee will review cur%
courses and encourage the deve -

opment of inter-disciplinary
courses designed to give students a
well-rounded liberal arts educa-
tion. a

I am a student member of the
CAS Council. In my opinion, the ad
hoc committee identiﬁed some real
problems here at Pitt, but I don’t
think the imposition of an
additional six credit requirement
will solve these problems. We as
students would beneﬁt much more
from increased quality in the
available courses, and not from a
two course requirement increase. I
don’t think the ad hoc committees
recommendations really deal I
tively with the problem. However,
I need the opinions of as many CAS
students as possible before making
a decision. What do you think?

I can be contacted through

The “Atwood” cartoon that ran
in the November 4 issue marks the

has sunk. Betsy Norman and Matt

described as outright theft. The

subject of his cartoon can only be
campus police do not care what
illegal or illicit acts occur in the

not a hotplate being used. This
exact topic is part of a routine of a
young comedian from Boston
named David Sayh. He performed
this routine on a comedy special
seen in Pittsburgh on. Channell 53
on October 22 and on the Tonight

Show on October 27. The routine is
excellent and Sayh has a great deal
of talent and imagination.

If Kambic and Norman did not '

highly unlikely because of the facts,

earlier written by another person.

On Tuesday (Election Day,

you blew it! You showed the
Legislature that you have no
power; yet now you're willing to
expend time, effort, resources and
money (approximately $30,000 to
$50,000 to cover costs for the 3,000

participants) to go to Harrisburg to

Legislature’s lack of concern for

the state.

Where were you when the power
was being handed out? I didn't see
you registering to vote, nor did I
see you Tuesday at the polls.

When you go to Harrisburg, I
hope you'll have a nice, safe trip
and possibly even learn some-
thing—but I doubt it. You haven't
learned from past experiences. It's
really too bad you have no sense of
history.

When will you learn that a
political ofﬁcer holds his office by
your consent (vote)? He well knows
that you can take away that consent

That is not the point, for I
sincerely doubt Sayh or any other

Even if Kambic and Norman
chose to steal Sayh’s routine and

be a party to such an act by an act of
ommission on their own part;

Closer scrutiny of the paper’s
contents, assurances that this type
of action will be avoided in the
future and apologies to the readers

are all in order.

Ever since the Supreme Court
heard the oral arguments in the
celebrated Bakke case. we have
been innundated with a barrage of
facts and ﬁgures from both sides
purporting to prove why Mr. Bakke
should or should not be admitted to
medical school. At the same time,
an army of self-styled “experts"
has been speculating at length on

 

   

the ramifications of the various
decisions that might be rendered.
But when one pierces the clouds of
rhetoric, it becomes apparent very
few commentators have wrestled
with the fundamental issue: what
afﬁrmative action really means.
‘Affirmative action is nothing
more than discrimination. No

honest individual, even its staunch-
est supporter, could say otherwise.
It is a policy by which the
government and private entities
are not only permitted, but
required. to favor one group of
individuals over another merely
because the members of the first
group have a certain skin color,
surname or physiology. It does not
allow for individual merit to be
taken into account. It is patently
dehumanizing.

It is also illegal. The 14th
amendment clearly prohibits the
denial of equal protection of law to
any person. Yet affirmative action
does just that. While paying lip
service to the proposition that all
men are created equal, it takes an
Orwellian turn by declaring “some
are more equal than others.”

Why, then, is it allowed to
continue? “It is necessary," we are
told by those who have nothing to
lose since they are already well
established, “to atone for the past
injustices we have inflicted upon
minority groups.” Baloneyl Be-
cause a handful of southern
aristocrats in the early 19th century
owned black slaves does not mean
the white of today must take a back
seat while members of minority
groups who may be less qualiﬁed
than them are given greater

or Affirmative Action And Discr

opportunities. Even if it were true
that we must pay for the sins of our
forefathers, the vast majority of
white people today. whose parents
and grandparents came over from
the old country long after the Civil
War freed the slaves and who were
often treated more harshly than the
blacks, would have to be excluded
from this mass exercise in
collective guilt.

But whites aren't the only ones
hurt by affirmative action. lts
supposed beneficiaries are hurt
even more by its degrading nature.

Sexual harassment—it’s scary,
embarrassing, degrading and di-
rected against women. At Pitt, it
thrives among the stacks at Hillman
Library and behind the pillars in the
Cathedral of Learning. Although
the number of rapes are few, hardly
a week goes by without a reported
incidence of an indecent exposure
or an obscene phone call on campus.

Don't Take Billy Seriously

By LEONARD ROMBERG

The only favor Newsweek could
do for President Carter, larger than
putting brother Billy on its cover
this past week, is to do this three
years from now, when Carter may

.for his second term...

’ Appearing soon on grocery
shelves in seven states, next to
Bud, Michelob, Coors, Schmidts,
will be “Billy Beer,” according to
Newsweek. What an excellent early
start for a re-election campaign.

No matter what the stiff-necked
political analysts and editorial
writers say about Billy's effect on
Jimmy, little brother is the greatest
campaign asset Jimmy could
have—beer and all.

No question about it—-Billy is a
nut, but he stands for ideals greatly
admired by many people in this
country. He is a prime example of a
successful, individual business-
man. Though he hates commercial-
‘ _nd has moved miles out of

touristy Plains, Georgia, to prove
it, Billy makes numerous appear-
ances at state fairs and auto races,

‘ and markets “Billy Beer.”

So much for anti-commercialism
and “Hee Haw” appearances.
Billy evidently- appeals to the
hearts of the beer guzzlers, country
folk and all those who believe in
“doing their own thing.”- His
half-million dollar road trip, which
will gross much more than his
brother’s Presidential salary, is
proof Billy is a drawing card.

The scene is the 1980 presiden-
tial election: Jimmy Carter is
playing it safe by staying in the
White House and keeping quiet.
The Republican candidate is busy
blasting away at the incumbent
Democrat’s stands on the issues.

Articulate Walter Mondale is
campaigning throughout the North-
east. appealing to the liberals and
big city voters who cannot stomach

—Billy. Billy Carter is taking care of

the rest of the nation.

p“

The Republican pushes renego-
tiation of the Panama Canal treaty:
Billy advocates the sale of
peanut-flavored liquor on Sunday.
The GOP offers tax cuts; the
Democrats offer “Bi11y Beer.” The
issues are clear cut—the people
want beer.

Politics is out-—it is boring,
confusing and full of unkept
promises. No one is taking Billy
seriously, but no one is taking
politics—period. The campaign
strategy has changed since 1976;
instead of taking three sides on
each issue, the issue will not even
be discussed. Why put people in a
bad mood with talk about un-
employment, inflation, crime and
war?

It is election day. The people are
showing up at the polls in record
numbers. As the votes are counted,
64 to 75 percent is estimated. The
crucial’ question is: Will the
six-pack determine the election’s
outcome?

Afﬁrmative action says to the
black, chicano or women: “Be-
cause you are what you are, you are
inherently incapable of making it
on your own. Therefore, you must
be given special help by Big
Brother. You're not good enough to
succeed by yourself." As Senator
S.I. Hayakawa recently remarked,
this kind of condescending attitude
has stripped many minority group
members and women of their self
respect, so that more and more
they have come to rely on special
favors from the government rather

said‘Deputy chief Sam Conte of the
campus police. “The exhibitionist
gets his thrills from the reaction of
the victim. She should stay calm,
immediately leave the area, and call
the police.” The “ﬂasher,” he said,
is psychologically disturbed, but
usually not violent. He must be
reported to be stopped.

Obscene phone calls are a part of
the dormitory experience. “This
guy would call me up and then the
room next to me, one after, the
other, at four in the morning, and
ask all kinds of weird questions.”
one woman resident recounted.
This form of harassment must be

'dealt with in the same way as the

others; it must be reported. The
police can monitor the calls and try
to track down the offenders. If the
caller thinks the police are in on the
game, he will stop.

ienced sexual harassment express
fear about the repercussions of
reporting the crime. “You have to

Afﬁrmative action is
wrong,
with employment practices or
admissions policies. That is why
nothing less than a sweeping ban of
all forms of discrimination will be
acceptable when the Supreme
Court hands down its decision in
the Bakke case. Until that day

to realize its most basic goal: equal
opportunity for all.

said another victim. Deputy Conte
said most forms of sexual harass-
ment, except assault and rape, are
misdemeanors carrying sentences
that range from ﬁnes to short jail
terms. However, due to the nature
of these crimes, most offenders are
sent to Western Psychiatric Insti-
tute for psychiatric help, to clear up
their problems. “But if a woman is
not willing to press charges, ’ ’ Conte
said, “the man is released.”

The answer to the problem is not
easy, but it's clear. To eliminate
harassment of women on campus, it
is necessary to stop the men who
commit the crimes. Once the
offenders know women are starting
to point fingers, they will think
twicebefore continuing this degen-
erate behavior, at the expense of
Pitt women's peace of mind.

Pm .\C\\\ Slart \\ riicr

It was an exceptionally busy
October morning in the Field House_
ofﬁce of Pitt's director of athletics.
Two female employees from the
football officer" sat in the small
waiting room, giggling nervously.
One wore a football uniform and the
other was clad in a clown costume.

“Is he too busy to see us?” one
asked.

“Well, it is a hectic morning,”
the secretary replied, ”but I’m sure
he’ll appreciate the time you took
out to stop in.”

She reached over and pressed the
intercom button‘.

“Mr. Myslinski, a footballl
recruit and his father are here to see
you.”

“Have they talked to anyone
else?” answered a low voice.

“No sir—they wanted to speak
with you ﬁrst.”

“I’ll be right out.”

Afew seconds later, the door
opened, and Casimir J. Myslinski
entered the waiting room. The tall,
stern-looking man glanced brieﬂy at
the girls and burst out laughing.

W} “He really got a big kick out of
it, ’ ’ said Arleen Carpenter, Myslin-
ski’s pleasant middle-aged secre-
tary. “And take my word for it—it
was a really busy day for him. He
had a lot on his mind.

‘ ‘Wecan do things like that at the
office,” she continued. “He’s not
at all the mean person some people
think he is.

“When I first started working for
him three and a half years ago, I was
terrified of him. He seemed so
strict. When he'd walk into the
office without saying much to me,

‘x

I thought I did something wrong.
But gradually, I got to know what
he's really like.

“The thing about him that
impresses me the most is that he’s
an extremely fair man," Carpenter
said. “He always looks at all sides of
an issue presented to him. Sure, he
can be a leader and exert his
authority when he needs to, but he
examines the details first.

“From a secretarial standpoint,
I'd say he’s a fantastic boss,” she
explained. “Ifhe wasn’t, Iwouldn’t
be here. I previously worked for the
School of Medicine and had a great
boss—so Mr. Myslinski had large
shoes to ﬁll. And he ﬁlled them."

Carpenter admitted Myslinski
sometimes gives people the impres-
sion he is a harsh person. “It may
be because of his athletic and
military background,” she specu-
lated.

These areas have composed a
large part of Myslinski’s life, so
Carpenter’s assumption may hold
some truth.

While attending Steubenville High
School, Myslinski lettered in
baseball; track and football. He
went on to enter the last pre-World
War II class at West Point. There,
he wrestled, and captained the 1943
Army football team. That year, he
earned the Most Valuable Player
award and was named to every
ﬁrst-team all-American squad, at
center. He also received the Knute
Rockne Award . as /i the nation’s
outstanding lineman.

Myslinski graduated in 1944 with
a degree in engineering and
military science. Myslinski then
entered the Air Force, and became
the assistant coach of its football
team.

“It was a natural jump, because
all through my academic and
military career I was dealing with
people, ” said Myslinski. “Anytime
you’re thinking of people, you have
to think of their welfare. And when
you think of lots of people,
athletics are usually mixed in.”

According to Myslinski, his ﬁrst
major concern at Pitt was to clean up

there was controversy over the

Friday, it won’t be Matt
Cavanaugh or Hugh Green leading
Pitt against Penn State, but Sigma
Chi’s Alan Brader and Robert
Kurey.

The game is MasterMind, not
football, and these two students
were winners in recently-held
intramural competition.

Sixty-four players from 31 Greek
organizations, plus The Pitt News,
competed last Wednesday and
Thursday for the chance to
represent Pitt. MasterMind, a
strategy board game manufactured
by Invicta Plastics Inc., has become
the biggest international game
craze since backgammon.

Invicta has organized a nation-
wide competition, in which 16
universities, most of them longtime
rivals in football brawn, are pitting
their logical minds against each
other this fall, for the opportunity to
represent the United States in the
Second Annual International Mas-
terMind tournament in London Dec.
3.”

The victor of this clash with Penn
State will not go to the Orange Bowl,

National tournament. Other
matches are:Northeastem-Boston.
Texas Christian-Southern Metho-
dist, Rice-University of Houston,
Michigan-Ohio State, Illinois-
Northwestern, Purdue-Indiana and
Berkely-Stanford.

Five of these interscholastic
matches originally were scheduled
for the weekends of the competitors
football matchups, in order to
intensify rivalries. Unfortunately,
Pennsylvania's matchup no longer
coincides. Nonetheless, any
competition with Penn State
becomes a matter of pride, and at
least one local news program has
agreed to report on Friday’s
four-hour match. Starting at ll a.m.~
in the Student Unionolpower Lounge,
the four players, fwill attempt to
decipher their opponents’ hidden
“Code” in 10 moves, by advancing
small plastic pegs of various colors
along a game board.

Over four million MasterMind
sets have been sold in 63 countries;
350,000 games boards are manu-
factured by the company each week.

The game oornes in a variety of
sizes and versions, There is a more

Under 21 ’s Welcome

ByMARKHALE

Antonino’s on South Craig
Street, in Pittsburgh’s new music
club, comparable to New York’s
Bottom Line, Philadelphia’s Main
Point and Cinncinati’s Bogart’s.
Because alcohol is not served,
Antonino’ s entertainment is open to
those under 21.

Antonino’s said ﬂoor manager
Terrell Funk, is establishing itself
as a showcase club where food is
served and performees can be seen
up close, providing more interaction
between artist and audience.

Funk believes Antonino’s pur-
pose is to present national recording
talent in a small, comfortable
setting. Crowds at the theater, The
Syria Mosque and the Civic Arena
often number in the thousands.

“Antonino’s is building a name
within the industry as an excep-
tional club for the atmosphere,”
Funk said. “We have found that
audiences are extremely coopera-
tive, making it more and more a
listening room-type atmosphere.”

The possibility exists alcohol will
be served with future shows if the
under-21 crowd does not support the
club. Yet even with a liquor license,
Funk said alcohol could simply not
be served during shows.

“If we ﬁnd Antonino’s and the
talent are not enough to bring
people in, and serving alcohol is the
only way we can get the people to
come in order to stay open, that’s
the course we’ll have to take.”

Funk would prefer shows without

Antonino’s audiences usually
have been over 21, but the club will

Nazareth Is Back On The Right Track

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
PilI.lN'ews Stall Writer
Nazareth lead singer Dan
McCafferty seems to be -your

typical Scot-fun-loving, hard-
drinking and refreshingly opinion-
ated.

His hand, the four-piece hard
rock group Nazareth, opened the
bill for Kansas Thursday night
before a capacity Civic Arena
crowd.

A hardworking band, Scotland’s
Nazareth has toured all over North
America for the last 18 months,
trying to regain an audience that
has waned_in recent years.

The group seemed on the verge
of breaking big in the States with
the 1976 success of its AM hit,
“Love Hurts," and its gold album
“Hair of the Dog.” However,
things have slipped a bit since
then.

“I feel the music we do and the

set we play is an entertaining one
for kids who like to rock’n’ roll,”
said McCafferty. “not some
middle-aged program director
playing the Carpenters and all the
other rubbish that seems to be
ﬂooding the air waves of late."

With the stance of a basic,
hard-rocking, street band,
Nazareth has run into complica-
tions because airplay for its music
has become limited.

However, McCafferty said he
didn’t feel the band would be
pushed out by lack of airplay or the
punk rock movement.

“American radio seems to be in
sad shape because of this emphasis
on middle—of-the-road music, which
is played because it is not annoying
or stark enough to take away from
the real interest of radio stations,
which is to make money from
commercials,” said McCafferty.

“As far as these punk rockers

\

go—who in the hell are they trying
to kid? The Sex Pistols and the
Johnny Rottens and ~the Rat
Scabies and all the other weird
bullocks the_v’re‘trying to come up
with.

“Who in their right mind would
want to go and see some so-called
punk rock musician get up onstage
with a safety pin through his nose
or a bolt through his jaw. splt on

K

the audience, and play dismal rock

music? Cartainly not me,”
McCafferty said.
Since McCafferty seemed so

down on radio and punk rockers, it
seemed inevitable to ask him what
Nazareth had to offer.

“For one thing, entertaining
rock ‘n’ roll," he said. “That is at
the core of everything we do. We
try to make it entertainment.

” RT S/
entertainment

People should not pay money to go
see a band that is going to burn
them out with its ‘be all and end
all‘ visions of apocalypse, if there
isn’t political change.

“ljust don't think it is proper, at
all times, to use rock music as a
political forum. Sometimes its
appropriate and much needed. But
most of the time its deadly

boring."

    Public TheaterA Hit In Show Farce

By TOBI ROSEN
Pitt News Sufi‘ Writer

You always can tell with the
Pittsburgh Public Theater.

In the opening seasons of
Pittsburgh's resident professional
company, general director Ben
Shaktman served the finest assort-
ment of classical and contemporary
theater in town.

Its latest venture, George
Bernard Shaw’s “You Never Can
Tell,” cements the theater’s
reputation by breaking away from
the mediocre pap that passes’for
“culture. ' ’

The wildly entertaining play
charts the upsurge of human
emotion, spilling love and laughter

- into the lives of a family tied to

social convention.

In the play, set at the turn of the
century, Shaw tackles the timeless
question of adhering too strictly to
any moral code—even a seemingly
sensible one.

Mrs. Clandon heads a fatherless
family of three, carefully following
directions from books on 20th
century living, which she herself
has compiled. Her eldest daughter
Gloria has been nurtured with a
correct amount of sensibility,
chieﬂy a pledge to “modern
womanhood.”

Human nature prevails, as Gloria
succumbs to the provincial emotion
of love. Shaw’s witty dialogue ﬂirts

with sacred issues of the day:
motherhood, marriage, ﬁdelity,
lineage. He drags his characters to
their inevitable fates. Despite
avowed protests, each rejoices at
the outcome. '

Aside from the love interest,
Shaw reunites Mr. Crampton with
Crampton’s unconventional house-

hold, from which he has been
separated for 18 years. In a
beautifully scripted and directed
scene, Shaw sets the potentially
explosive reconciliation at luncheon
in an elegant hotel. In an
atmosphere of crystal, silver and
well-mannered waiters, director

John Going captures the scene’s

squeamish tension with marvelous
subtlety.

Going, returning to the Public
Theater after scoring a success
with “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest,” in the theater’s inaugral
season, sets the Shavian humor
close to the edge. Occassionally, he

.does fall from the sublime to the
absurd."

Going punctuates the dialogue

with knowing glances and thought-

ful sighs to underline the humoufil
This technique interrupts the ’

play’s natural ﬂow.

A beautifully crafted set
heightens the realistic ﬂavor of the
play, while sculpted lighting
fixtures hanging from the rafters
give the traditional setting an airy
feeling.

strata, while light, summery colors
emphasize the infectious frivolity of
the action.

Erika Petersen’s romantic Gloria
scores a stunning success, as she
wrestles with the pangs of a girlish
first love.

As the gregarious twin brother
and sister, Gun-Marie Nilsson and
John Seidman abound with unlimit-
ed energy.

Bravado permeates Robert
Blackburn's Mr. Crampton, adding
vulnerability to his craggy exterior.

As a special student recruitment
policy, the Public Theater reduces
ticket prices to $2.50, and makes

Sex Pistols Give Best In Punk Rock

By JIM FARERI
Pill News Staff Writer
Never Mind The Bullocks Here’s
The Sex Pistols '
Sex Pistols
Virgin

At present, this long awaited
ﬁrst album by the Sex Pistols is
available only as an import on
Virgin records. However, Warner
Brothers has recently signed the
band and “Never Mind The
Bullocks Here's The Sex Pistols”
will soon be released in America.

Much information about the Sex
Pistols has been transmitted from
England to America by a seemingly
ambivalent and confused American
press. Rolling Stone, for instance,
did a cover story on the Pistols,
derogatorily entitled “Rock Is Sick
And Living In London.” The
article, however, was not deroga-
tory, and even concluded in
qualiﬁed praise of the hand.

But now the press may be duly

- ignored and the ~p1joduct, itself

sampled. Some advice: Don’t be
scared off by self-righteous critics
who have neatly wrapped-up punk
rock and chucked it in the garbage.
To judge the Sex Pistols, or any
other band, on the basis of how
they look or act, or on false

appraisals of their music, is just as v

simpleminded as calling the
Rolling Stones anarchists was a
decade ago. Some rock writers, and
many more self-proclaimed critics,
have gotten away with this kind of
journalism because, until now,
British punk bands have been
largely inaccessible to American
audiences. “Never.Mind The
Bullock” will change all that.
The Sex Pistols are: Paul Cook.
beating the drums with the
energies of all past drummers;
Steve Jones, mincing his guitar
into power chords; Sid Vicious, who
recently replaced original bassist
Glen Matlock and learned his
instrument only upon joining the
group, and, of course, Johnny
Rotten. '

 

With his pale, sickly complexion,
bent form and half-nasal scream of
a voice, Johnny Rotten is the lead
singer and front man of the Sex
Pistols. In both voice and
demeanor, Rotten symbolizes the
Sex Pistols’ attitude: a reveling in
what they believe to be the
boredom and vacuousness of lower
class English lives. At the end of
one of the best numbers on “Never
Mind The Bullocks," the infamous
“God Save The Queen,” Rotten
yells, “No future, No future, ‘no
future for you!" The “you" is
himself, the Sex Pistols, the British
punk rockers. and all poor English
youths strangling in the contracting
British economy.

Of course, the listener can take
the Pistols philosophy to heart or

The album is a history of the Sex
Pistols from its inception to the
present. It contains all four of its
singles, from “Anarchy in the
U.K.,” first performed in July,
1976 and promptly banned by the
BBC, to “Holidays In The Sun,” its
latest single. The other two
numbers previously released are
“God Save The Queen,” a scathing
indictment of the “boring” Queen
and her “boring" Jubilee, and
“Pretty Vacant,” with its chorus of
“We’re so pretty, oh, so pretty
vac—ant." It can be said, without
fear of sounding presumptuous
“Anarchy in the U.K." and “God
Save the Queen” are two of the
best rock songs ever recorded.
They alone make this album a
necessity for anyone with a taste
for rock.

All l1.of the numbers on “Never
Mind The Bullocks” are quality
chord rockers: the Pistols concen-
trate their energies on one_ good
rhythm rather than on a hodge-

,podge, of. melody and: instrumental

solos. They prove that whether a
rock song be rudimentary or
ornate, it must have an intangible,
lyrical quality to be a good song.
The Sex Pistols possess such
qualities in abundance.

Songs not previously releasedﬂ
singles are as good as those that 

were. Particularly fine in this lot
are “Bodies,” a graphic item on
abortion; “New York,” disdaining
the city while poking fun at the
New York Dolls, and “EMI,” the
Pistols‘ revenge on their ﬁrst
reactionary recording‘ company.
Other numbers are “Liar,” “No
Feeling," “Problems” and
“Seventeen (previously “I'm a
Lazy Sod”). All tracks are about
three minutes long, sparing the
excess and bringing home the fury.

I?

The title of this LP is. like the _

music it offers. basic but apt.

you're looking for the best in hard 

rock ‘n’ roll, and perhaps some
ﬁery and pertinent lyrics to boot,
never mind a lot of the sludge
ﬁlling record store racks.

The problem with “Bobby
Deerﬁeld" is that it has been told
much better many times before.

The basic premise is boy meets
girl, they fall in love and the girl
dies. But. of course, not until she
has influenced his life in such a way
that he will be inspired by her
death and be a better person for it.
Amen.

The boy in this case is the
internationally famous race care
driver. Bobby Deerﬁeld (played by
Al Pacino). Deerﬁeld is a sophis-
tocated. bored-with-it-all type—in
short. just waiting for someone to
come and change his life. Natural-
ly. he has a gorgeous mistress (well
played by Anny Duperey), but.
despite her looks and doting
affection. Deerﬁeld just stays his
blase self until Lillian (Marthe
Keller) comes into his life.

What exactly he sees in
Lillian—and it’s not her looks
because, next to Duperey, Keller

Pitt Too Much for Army,   2-26 

Orange Committee Divided; Pitt Hopes Rise

By CRISTOPHERC. HOEL
Pitt News Stan Wrucr
Pitt, which last week appeared
to be locked out of the major bowl
picture, may have new life in what
has become a three-team race for an
Orange Bowl bid, The Pitt News has
learned. ~
A Miami source close to the bowl
situation said the change in Pitt’s
prospects came at a meeting of the
Orange Bowl team selection
committee last night. '
Committee chairman Bob Laf-
ferty had ‘been quoted as saying his
bowl would pick an opponent for the
Big Eight champion Nov. 19, and
that he preferred Penn State. That
centered Pitt's bowl hopes largely
around the Gator"Bowl.
But, the source said, Lafferty left
last night's meeting uncertain as to
what his committee would do.

Larry Sims awaits pitch out en route to his second-quarter Tb.

“He had said earlier that the
Orange would not wait past Nov.
19, ” the source said. ‘ ‘But when we
talked to him tonight, he hedged on
that.

“He said the committee was
divided on what to do,” the source
added. “The committee has not
made a decision on what it will
do...it’s now possible that they’ll
wait past Saturday.”

The source also said Penn State
may no longer be ahead of a pack
that includes the Lions, Pitt and
Arkansas on the Orange “wanted”
list.

“That may have been true earlier
in the week,” he said of Penn
State's lead, “but all that changed
when Arkansas beat (Texas) A&M
in College Station.

“Arkansas has become a very
attractive team,” he said. “The

Srakocic photo

Orange Bowl is well aware that
Arkansas brought 38,000 and
33.000 people with them on their
last two bowl trips.

. “On top of that, they’re ranked
high. I’d say it is a good two-team
race, and Arkansas and Penn State

‘are on the inside.”

Pitt chances rest with the chance
Lafferty’s committee will wait until
after the Thanksgiving weekend to
extend its invitation. Should Pitt,
the favorite, beat Penn State at Pitt
Stadium Nov. 26, the Panthers
would be Arkansas’s competition
for the Orange bid.

Pitt officials, mindful of their
need to impress, have told the
Orange Bowl they would guarantee
sale of 12,500 tickets to the game if
invited, and that they would
guarantee that more people than
that would make the trip to Miami,

Jones Leaves Army. Cold

ByJIMLEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.--
“Id1dn’t plan it. ’ ’ Pitt wide receiver
Gordon Jones said of his fumble
fourth-quarter kickoff reception
that he turned into a 93-yard
touchdown run. “But I think it
helped. Army saw the ball bounce
and tried to recover the fumble. I

just grabbed it and ran.”

-A run that enabled the Panthers
to beat the 25-point spread bettors
predicted the ninth-ranked squad
would win by—but it wasn’t easy.
Although Jones romped for 60 yards
in punt returns, 68 yards in pass
receptions and 112 yards in kickoff
returns, the junior fumbled three
times-——losing one.

“They (the Cadets) were calling
me names on the sidelines after

 it each fumb_le,”pJones remembered.

‘ ‘Ithink Iwas a little over anxious to
do well. And it was kind of
chilly—my hands were kind of cold.
“But don’t get me wrong—I’m
not making any excuses for my
fumbles,” he continued. “Hope-
fully, it won’t happen again.”

When it didn’t happen, Jones
was spectacular. A S4-yard punt
return set up a seven-yard
touchdown run by Larry Sims that
put Pitt ahead 24-0, and two key
receptions of Matt Cavanaugh
passes—one of 21 yards, the other
26 yards—led to 21 of the Panthers’
31 second-quarter points. The
Cavanaugh-to-Jones game plan
worked perfectly all afternoon and
is beginning to dominate space in
scoring summaries.

“It’s hard to say whether or not
Matt’s one of the best quarterbacks

in the country.” Jones said,‘ ‘but he .

is deﬁnitely a very good quarter-
back. He managed to come back
after his injury and take command.
Ithink we'd have been undefeated
today if he hadn't have gotten
hurt.”

But Cavanaugh did get hurt, thus
costing Pitt a win or two and a clear
bowl picture.

“We’re not looking past Penn
State,” Jones said quickly. “Right
now, I’m looking forward to Penn
State--they should give us all we
can handle and I think we'll give
them all they can handle. I’d just
like them to wait until after that
game to give out bowl bids. We

have one of the best teams in the’

country, if not the best.

Personally, I'd like to go to the
Orange Bowl—I’ve never been to
Miami.”

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ.--
There was just too much Pitt
offense for Army to handle
Saturday, as the Panthers stomped
the Cadets, 52-26, at sparkling
Meadowland Stadium.

The overdose came in the form of
Matt Cavanaugh’s passing, a
two-touchdown performance by
Willie Taylor, a Pitt team rushing
average of better than ﬁve yards
and the multi-purpose talents of
Gordon “Too Much” Jones.

As a disappointing crowd of
35,387 looked on, the Panthers won
the toss and elected to receive-
something Pitt has refused to do for
most of the season. Greg McCray
returned Mark Hargis’ kickoff 31
yards, enabling Cavanaugh and
Company to set up shop in decent
ﬁeld position at the 36-yard line.

Pitt netted 27 yards rushing on
the ﬁrst four plays, but Chuck
D’Amico forced a Fred Jacobs
fumble that Steve Miller recovered

‘at the Army 37-yard line. The

Cadets were unable to do anything
with their ground game, but

‘quarterback Leamon Hall cooly

converted four consecutive third
downs, and Army was in business
with a ﬁrst and goal at the Pitt
3-yard line. On the next play, Greg
King, Army’s leading rusher,
rescued the Panthers with a fumble
that was recovered by Panther
Dave DiCiccio at the seven-yard
line.

Cavanaugh marched the
Panthers 93 yards on nine plays,
the drive capped by a 38-yard strike
to Taylor to put Pitt on the

according to a Miami sports writer
who said Penn State had made
similar pledges. .

The schools could guarantee
ticket sales by offering to buy (and
eat) any unsold tickets. How they
would guarantee a number of
bodies was not explained.

Another Miami source said the
Orange Bowl, still hurting from
being spurned by Pitt a year ago,
would not invite Pitt under any
circumstances butthes orts writer

 

‘ scoreboard ﬁrst. Mark Schubert's

kick made the lead 7-0 with 4:44
left in the ﬁrst period.

Army gained 33 yards'on the
ensuing exchange of punts, but
Hall momentarily lost his touch and
the Cadets’ Mike Castilli was wide
to the left with a 42-yard ﬁeld goal
attempt.

Pitt immediately cranked up its
offense, needing only seven plays
to march the ball down to the Army
seven-yard line, but the drive
stalled there. The Panthers settled
for three points, as
connected on a 24-yard ﬁeld goal
for a 10-0 margin with 12:38 left in
the half.

Moments later, Pitt struck again
as J .C. Wilson notched his second
interception of the season, and a
24-yard return placed the Panthers
at the Army 14. On the next play,
Elliott Walker burst up the middle
for _the touchdown, and Pitt had 10
points in 86 seconds and a 17-0
cushion.

Army was able to muster nothing
on its next series, and the Cadets
prepared to punt from their own
20-yard line. The Panthers counter-
ed with the kamikaze return
formation that places the two
defensive ends on the line of
scrimmage while the" remaining
rushers stand ﬁve yards away in an
upright position. At the snap, the
Panthers slowed the coverage by
cutting the Cadets down in their
tracks. Jones fielded Ward
Whyte’s punt, reversed his ﬁeld
and outran the pursuit on the way
to a 54-yard return.

ByBOBLABRIOLA
Pill News Staff Writer

It was a heartbreaking way to
end the season, as the Pitt water
polo team bowed to Bucknell, 21-20,
in sudden death overtime in the
ﬁnals of the Eastern Champion-
ships, held at Trees Pool this
weekend.

The match was another of the
continuing classics between the
Panthers and Bisons, and it was
ﬁtting the Eastern representative
was one of these teams. Pitt fought
back from seemingly insurmount-
able Bucknell leads several times,
but lost a chahce to put the
championship away in the fourth
period of regulation play.

Pitt and Bucknell exchanged
goals throughout the first period;
both teams displayed balanced
scoring, with seven different
players registering goals. The
Bisons led, 4-3, after the first

period.
The second quarter was a scoring
extravaganza, as Bucknell out-

scored Pitt, 8-6, in the period, and
took a 12-9 lead into the locker room
at the half. Scott Schulte scored
goals in the period to pace the Bison
attack. Butch Silva and George
Machicote kept the Panthers close
with their scoring and passing, but
turnovers and defensive lapses
enabled Bucknell to increase its
lead.

In the third period, the Panthers
tightened their defense, holding
Bucknell to -only one goal,’ and
narrowing the margin to 13-12 by
the end of the quarter. Silva scored
two of the three Panther goals in the
period, the last one coming at the
gun to put Pitt within striking
distance.

Machicote took over in the fourth
period, scoring three goals in a row

to bring Pitt from a two-goal deﬁcit
into the lead, 15-14, with a little
more than two minutes remaining.

Barry Ford scored what appeared to '

be the clinching goal moments
later. putting Pitt in front, 16-14.

With 1:20 left in regulation, goalie
Steve Feller blocked a penalty shot
to Rick Renner, but Schulte came
right back to score, making it a

pone-goal differential for the 12th

time in the match.

Feller committed a costly turn-
over with 18 seconds remaining,
and Jay Fisette capitalized to send
the game into overtime.

The overtime period was a
continuation of what happened
during the first four periods, as»
neither team was ever ahead by
more than one goal and there were
four different ties. Silva again was
the Panthers’ major offensive
threat, scoring three goals, but the
Panthers were not able to hold on to
the lead.

Bucknell won the faceoff at the
beginning of the sudden death
period, but Feller blocked Renner’s
attempt to turn the ball over to Pitt.
The Panthers never got a shot on
goal in sudden death, as Schulte’s
steal gave the ball right back to the
Bisons. After a 30-second penalty
to Ford, Ken Genscheimer scored
on the power play, after one minute
had elapsed, to give Bucknell a
21-20 victory, the Eastern cham-
pionship and a bid to the NCAA
tournament.

Machicote, Pitt's leading scorer
throughout the season, led the way
with six goals, followed by Silva and
Mike Mere, who added five apiece.
Feller did a commendable job in
goal, with 14 saves in the marathon
ﬁnal. The loss squelched Pitt's
hopes of improving on last year's
ranking of eighth in the nation.

Aerials Gun Down Army

Army took the second-half
kickoff and marched to the
Panthers‘ 29-yard line where the
Cadets were faced with a fourth
and four situation. With nothing to
gamble. Army elected to go for it,
but DiCissio broke through to sack
Hall for an eight-yard loss, turning
the ball over to Pitt.

Penalties, which have plagued
the Panthers throughout the
season, stiﬂed the Pitt drive. and
Joe Gasparovic's 45-yard punt
turned the ball over to the Cadets
at midfield.

Army finally put its offense in
gear, with Hall twice finding his
favorite _ receiver, Clennie
Brundidge, on third down situa-
tions. Hall scored the touchdown
on a sneak, and then passed to
Brundidge for the two-point con-
version as Army closed the gap to
38-8.

Jackie Sherrill countered with
several substitutes, giving the
entire starting backﬁeld the rest of
the afternoon off. Rick Trocano
directed the Panthers on a 16-play,
71-yard drive, keeping the ball on
the ground to allow the seconds to
tick away. Trocano then went to the
air for the touchdown, hitting Benjy
Pryor with a two-yard pass. Trout
converted. and the count was 45-8.

With Pitt’s offense and defense
riddled with inexperience, it
appeared most of the game’s
theatrics had come to a conclusion.
On his final pass of the day, Hall hit
Brundidge with a 52-yard scoring
strike. making it 45-14. Hall was
then replaced at quarterback by
Earle Mulrane who was unable to

move the Cadets on his first series. ‘

Jones fumbled the punt, however,
at the Pitt 30,‘ and Jon Dwyer
‘bolted around rightend for Army’s

second score on the next play. The
two—point attempt was broken up
by Carlton Williamson, and Pitt
was clinging to a 45-20 lead.

On the ensuing kickoff, Jones
capped the afternoon’s activities by
going 93 yards for the score after
initially fumbling the ball.

“My hands were getting kind of‘

cold out there,” Jones explained,
“but I wanted to make up for the
touchdown 1 cost the team by
fumbling that punt.”

The final score of the game was
set up by Lindsay Delaney’is_
fumble, Pitt’s sixth of the day, as
Mulrane escaped the outside
contain__ment and ran 10 yards into
the end zone. Willie Marsh broke
up Army’s attempt for two points,
making the ﬁnal score, 52-26.

Sherrill was pleased with the
performance,
allowed’ Army to make the game
appear closer than it was in the
second half.

“We didn't play very well in the
second half," Sherrill said. “We
had some busts on defense, but we
played 61 people out there today.
We gave a good account of
ourselves in the first half, and I feel
we’re deserving of a major bowl
bid. We have some great individual
talent, which makes us one of the
finest teams in the country.”

“Right now, we’re not looking
past Penn State,” Jones added.
"They'll be ready for us since we
beat them last year, and I ﬁgure
Penn State will give us all we can
handle.” .

Army coach Homer Smith put
the entire day in perspective, “I

Steelers Hold Off Cleveland Rally

«PITTSBURGH (AP)—Terry
Bradshaw passed for three touch-
downs before he was knocked from
the game with a shoulder injury,
and the Pittsburgh Steelers held off
a fourth-quarter rally to beat the
Cleveland Browns 35-31 Sunday.

It was a season-high point total
for the Steelers, who jumped into a
tie with Cleveland atop the
National Football League’s
American Conference Central
Division. Both teams are 5-4.

The Browns trailed 35-10 in the
ﬁnal quarter before backup quar-
terback Dave Mays combined with
running back Larry Poole for three
touchdown passes.

Bradshaw hit 13 of 21 passes for
a season-high of 283 yards despite
a cast on his left wrist he fractured
ﬁve weeks ago.

He was helped to the sidelines in
the last quarter when belted from
the blind side by Cleveland
linebacker Gerald Irons. Bradshaw
injured his right shoulder on the
play and lost a fumble, but he
remained on the sideline the rest of
the game.

MEN SPIKERS MEET

There will be a meeting tonight
for any undergraduate interested in
joining Pitt’s men’s volleyball club.
The meeting will be held at 6:30
p.m. in Trees Hall‘s small gym.

Ca vaugh '5 Individual Honors Unlikely   e

 

Pitt senior quarterback Matt Cavanaugh.

Cleveland, which lost starting
quarterback Brian Sipe midway in

the second period with an injured 2

shoulder, remained winless in
eight games at Three Rivers
Stadium, where light snow fell
during Sunday’s game.

“Everyone decided to play
football. They left the streetﬂght at
home,” said Pittsburgh Coach
Chuck Noll, who has watched bitter
exchanges between the two teams
in recent seasons.

“It wasn’t a typical Cleveland-
Pittsburgh game,” echoed Browns’
Coach Forrest Gregg.

It wasn’t a totally placid
afternoon. Cleveland defensive end
Joe “Turkey” Jones stomped
around angrily after an offsides call
against him, and Steeler defensive
end Dwight “Mad Dog” White
screamed at the ofﬁcials after
somebody allegedly twisted his
face mask. But, all in all, chivalry
prevailed.

“It was hard-hitting football, but
overall there were very few
penalties,” said Gregg. “I think
that was a credit to both football
teams. I think both of us wanted to
play football and the heck with
everything else.”

The Browns took a 3-0 ﬁrst-
quarter lead on a 45-yard ﬁeld goal
by Don Cockroft, but Bradshaw
erased that with a 27-yard pass to
Lynn Swann to put Pittsburgh
ahead to stay. \‘

Before halftime, Pittsburgh had
a 28-3 edge with the help of three
more touchdowns that came on a

nu s o A A ~ . ~ . . ; A . . A . . . . . . . . . . . ..

So you think Matt Cavanaugh can still win
the Heisman Trophy. You still think there
might be some outside chance the Panther
quarterback will walk away with the
prestigious award and give Pitt the
distinction of having the best college football
players in the nation for two consecutive
years.

Well, if you’re thinking along those lines,
you probably thought there was a slim
chance the recent warm weather would last
until February.

Hate to disappoint you, but it just isn’t so.
Another disturbing fact——-Cavanaugh

 

   

selection. You heard right; he may not even
make the all-East team.

In a day and age when quantity sometimes
counts more than quality, Cavanaugh has
looked impressive since coming back from
the infamous broken left wrist he suffered
earlier this season. However, because of the

layoff, he just hasn’t thrown the ball enough
to collect the kind of statistics post—season

committees like to look at.

Over the years, it hasibeen proved post-
season selection committees take a look at
NCAA stat sheets to see who is doing great
things running, catching or throwing the
ball, and make their conclusions from there.

The situation is no different this year. The
three top candidates for the Heisman right
now are Earl Campbell, the big fullback
from the number-one ranked Texas

Longhorns; Terry Miller, a Dorsett—type‘

running back from Oklahoma State; and,
surprisingly, Notre Dame tight end Ken
MacAfee. Looking at this week’s official
NCAA stat sheet, you’ll notice all three are
listed near the top of their respective
categories.

2-yard run by Rocky Bleier, a
38-yard pass from Bradshaw to
John Stallworth and a 16-yard run
by Franco Harris.

Cleo Miller ran 5 yards for a
Cleveland touchdown in the third
quarter, but Bradshaw followed in
the ﬁnal period with a 9-yard
scoring toss to Stallworth.

The 21-point Cleveland surge,
directed by Mays in the ﬁnal
quarter, began with Poole’s 5-yard
scoring grab. That capped a
56-yard drive that included a
33-yard pass to Reggie Rucker.

Bradshaw was injured and
fumbled at the Pittsburgh 27-yard
line a series later, setting up
Poole’s 12th touchdown reception.

Later, Harris lost a fumble at the
Pittsburgh 24-yard line, four plays
later,’ Mays hit Poole with a 3-yard
scoring toss.

“A victory over Dallas, I think,
would carry us through the season.
I don't think we'd lose another
game,” Bradshaw said.

“Beating Dallas would be the
emotional stimulus that would
really explode this football team...
if we could pull one off on Dallas, I
think it's going to be the key to the
entire season."

There was no doubt in the mind
of Cleveland safety Thom Darden
about the key to Sunday’s game.

“It seems everytime we play
Terry Bradshaw here in Pittsburgh
he’s hot. and he was definitely not
today."

Campbell, the top candidate for the
trophy, is leading the NCAA in rushing.
Miller is second, and MaAfee is listed as the
nation’s fifth-ranked pass receiver.

Then, take a look at the top two
quarterbacks with a shot at beating out
Cavanaugh for all-East honors. Both
Army’s Leamon Hall and Chuck Fusina of
Penn State are listed among the national
leaders in passing.

Post-season selectors take a look at the
tangible things, like how many yards a
player has gained, and go hog wild marking
down his name on their ballots. They don’t
look at the intangibles Cavanaugh has—the
guts, the determination, the character, the
ability to bounce back from injury—things
Pitt head coach Jackie Sherrill says makes
Cavanaugh better than Joe Namath or Ken
Stabler.

lt’s a sad situation, but, according to Pitt
sports information director Dean Billick, it’s
just another fact of life.

Billick, part of whosejob is to publicize an
all-American candidate like Cavanaugh,
takes a realistic view of the situation_

“Matt just. doesn’t have the impressive
stats,” Billick said. “Although Matt, and
our team, have performed well since he came
back, he just doesn’t have the stats to make
him a candidate for the Heisman Trophy.
He might not even make it on the all-East
team. Statistically, Leamon Hall and Fusina

are having better years than Matt,

“Being hurt, he hasn’t passed the ball that
much to rank him among the national
passing leaders now,” Billick continued,

“although he has to be considered one of the

top four or five quarterbacks right now.”
lt’s a sad situation. Probably noother
football player in America today is more
deserving of post-season recognition than
Cavanaugh. But the senior quarterback
from Youngstown, Ohio, won’t be making
any acceptance speeches at the Heisman
Trophy dinner come December. He might

«even be beat out for all-East honors.

Quantity ranks above quality in this
special case. Matt Cavanaugh probably will
be shorlchanged.

lcers Notch First Win

By JIM PANE

Pill News Malt V\ rilcr
The Pitt Hockey Club scored
three unanswered goals last night
at the Civic Arena, en route to a 3-1

iihiictory over the University of

Virginia and its first win of the
season.

After Virginia took a short-lived
lead midway through the first
period, the Panthers rebounded
with one goal in each of the three
periods to raise their record to 1-1.

“Our lines are really starting to
jell now,” said Pitt head coach Len
Barcalow. “They are really coming

along nice.”
F8‘r'W'aftl Jittl O’Rt3t1rke gave

Virginia a 1-0 lead seven minutes
into the game, and had a chance to
widen the gap three minutes later
when Panther Dave Elson was
called for interference. Tom
Sherwin ended Virginia’s hopes of
a powerplay goal when he
intercepted the puck, and tallied
his ﬁrst goal of the season to knot
the score. A

Tim Duffy tallied the game
winner in the second period on an
assist from Larry Gallick. Duffy
took the pass and beat Virginia
goalie Dan Looney to make it 2-1
going into the ﬁnal period.

With the outcome still hanging in
the balance, the two clubs fought a
scoreless battle for 12 ‘and a half

   ITH THE PANTHERS

No matter where the Panthers go for
a bowl, you ’1lﬂythere with a friend if

you turn out to be the best guesser of
the Pitt-Penn State game’s outcome in
the Pitt News bowl contest.

Look for details and an entry blank

net. Wayne Bianchin made it 2-0
with a short-handed goal late in the
period.

But a little more than a minute
later, Craig Ramsay scored a
short-handed goal for Buffalo after
goalie Don Edwards started the
play following a save on Pierre
Larouche. .

Rene Roberttied the score early
in the third period when his pass
from behind the goal hit Pittsburgh
defenseman Dave Borrows and
bounced into the net.

in the Pitt News soon.

Hetz beat Looney for his third
redlighter of the campaign on
assists from Gallick and Gary Fries.

Pitt blasted Looney for 41 shots
in the contest, and deserved more
than three goals, but the Virginia
netminder stood ﬁrm. In the
Panther cage, Larry Newell made
his initial start of the season, and
made 14 saves despite being
hampered by a bruised toe. ‘

“We had trainer Bob Osborne
tape it up and put some Lucky
Indian pennies in there to get rid of
any bad hexes,” Barcalow joked.

But the hex turned out to be in
Virginia's corner, as the Southern
foe lost its second game in as many
days, bowing Saturday to
Carnegie-Mellon, 4-3.

“They have a big, strong team,”
Barcalow said of Virginia. “They
skate and they force the play right
at you.”

Second Season Underway
Thirteen Bids in Balance

The warm-ups are over and it's
time for college football’s second
season.

The second season is not to be
confused with the third season,
alias the post-season bowl games.
The second season is that ﬁnal step
to one of those holiday excursions,
of which there are now 13.

The invitations go out next
Saturday and that sigh of relief
emanating from Dallas comes to
you courtesy of the Cotton Bowl,
which sweated out ﬁfth-ranked
Notre Dame’s 21-17 come-from-
behind victory over No. 15 Clemson
and a probable match-up with No.
1-ranked Texas.

The top-rated Longhorns wallop-
ed Texas Christian, 44-14, but must
still play Baylor and llth-ranked
Texas A&M in the Southwest
Conference showdown.

The Aggies dropped a 26-20
squeaker to eighth-ranked
Arkansas, a triumph that left the
Orange Bowl with the problem of
inviting Arkansas or the Nov. 26
Penn State-Pitt winner to face the
Big Eight champ. Arkansas still
must face Southern Methodist and
Texas Tech.

The host spot in the Orange Bowl
will be up for grabs Nov. 25 when
third-ranked Oklahoma entertains

No. 12 Nebraska. The Sooners
pummeled Colorado, 52-14, while
Nebraska battered Kansas, 52-7.1

Meanwhile, second-ranked
Alabama, already assured of the
Southeastern Conference crown
and a berth in the Sugar Bowl,
trimmed Miami of Florida, 36-0.

The Sugar can probably assure
itself of a team with a likely higher
ranking by going for the Penn
State-Pitt victor. However, the
Sugar has never had a Big Ten
team while Pitt went to New
Orleans last season and Penn State
the year before.

Both teams won handily
Saturday. Ninth-ranked Penn State
clobbered Temple, 44-7, while No.
10 Pitt crushed Army, 52-26.

Meanwhile, seventh-ranked
Kentucky, on probation and head-
ed home for the holidays, shaded
Florida, 14-7.

No. 14 Southern California, a
Rose Bowl team eight times in 11
seasons, bowed out of this year's
race by losing to Washington,
28-10. The Paciﬁc-8’s Rose Bowl’s
representative will be either
Washington, which meets
Washington State next Saturday,
or UCLA, which beat Oregon State,
48-18, but must also beat Southern
Cal on Nov. 25.

four years.The weekend event at
Trees Hall featured seven teams,
including a Pitt squad that ﬁnished

Despite the Panthers’ poor
showing, Saurer reserved praise for
her unit.

“My fencers from Pitt were
simply marvelous,” she said.
“Considering the fact that they only
had since Sept. 6 to prepare for the
tournament, they did quite well.
You have to give them a hand.”

Though the Pitt squad on the
whole failed to give an impressive

Pantherfencer Bill Johnston agreed
with Saurer, who feels the Pitt
performance, because of an exper-

ience gap, wasn’t as degrading as it
may seem.

“We’ve only had two months of
experience,”Johnston noted, “and
that’s come from a Fencing I class.

“But on the whole, the tourna-

ment was pretty impressive,” he ~

added. “Everyone had a terriﬁc

time.”

Besides Johnston and Mandell,
the Panther squad consisted of
Carolyn Fenner, Bobi Eggleston,
Scott Fadzen, Fernando Salazar,
Ron Broadhead, Ray Intriere, Matt
Thorpe and Bob Melder.

“Nobody from Pitt did that
badly,” Saurer said. “Everybody
was beautiful.”
