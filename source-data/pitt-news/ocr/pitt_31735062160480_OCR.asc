Pitttvtakes Bid forWorldUniiv. PresidentNix0nN0me$ 

Pitt may become part of ,a world
university being considered by the
United Nations.

The University is bidding to
become a regional research and
training center with an internation-
al theme, which would be one of
several such centers ' in the
proposed United Nations Univer-
sity. ~

The UN General Assembly over-
whelmingly approved the world

"university concept "last December

and is now considering the
structure for such an institution.

According to Dr. Carl Beck, one of
the concepts cheif proponents at’
Pitt, the idea has been in the

planning stages for three years.

“It is very close to being adopted,”
Beck added.

The proposed institution is‘ not a
campus, Beck explained, but would
“make use of existing institutes. It

wouldn't be organized around the ‘

traditional American concept of- a
university." .

Beck added that the UN Univer-
sity _may not even be totally
composed of universities, but will
probably include institutes as
centers also.

According to the Post-Gazette,
Chancellor Wesley Posvar ap-
proved a blueprint of Pitt’s
program, including theme and
director, Monday, but officials
declined to release specifics.

Beck’s chief cohort in trying to
win a center for Pitt is Dr. Seth
Spaulding, professor of social
sciences here. Spaulding was
formerly director of the department
of school and higher education in
Paris.
University Center for International
Studies.

Despite the financial squeeze
facing the University, Beck fore-
sees no problem in handling the
proposed program, should it be
accepted.‘ He feels by utilizing
existing personnel and facilities,

. and seeking private support for the‘

new foreign faculty who will be
needed, no University funds will be
necessary. '

Beck is director of the“

Beck.said the center would permit
Pitt to expand _its interest in
international affairs and would
provide- a better communication»
lison with foreign universities.

The proposal is supported by the
United States,‘ Beck said, and
interest init has been high. He did
not name speciﬁc US schools
competing with Pitt, but feels the
Univesity may be ahead of the rest
in planning for the center.

’He said’ Pitt may already be the
most international of all American
universities, as a result of its
growing foreign affiliations and
programs. , H I

Beck claims this international

A emphasis at/Pitt, coupled with Dr.
Spaulding’s earlier participiationin
UNESCO and Beck and Posvar’s
participation in the planning of the
original UN University idea, places
Pitt in a favorable position;

Pitt’s proposal, for participation ,

will determine whether or not the
University is accepted as part of the
program, Beck said.

"A director and university council
would oversee the global, decen-
tralized network of centers and
programs for research and training
under the UN proposal. The idea
was first suggested in 1969 by U
Thant, former secretary-general.

Ansejo Resolution Seeks

Control ofDept. Chairmen

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

“The chairman's _, authority
should be preceived as primarily
derived from the faculty.” This is
the first paragraph of the contro-
versial Asenjoj Resolution. The
resolution has been*in discussion

again at the Faculty of Arts and
\ Sciences Coundil (FASC) yester-

day.

The resolution is an attempt to set
overall rules for the operation of
traditionally autonomous depart-
ments. Under it the chairmen of
these departments would face a
secret ballot vote by their col-
leagues. The bill would allow the
junior faculty to act on their
opinions without fear of reprisal by
their departmenthead. A

Dr. Florencio ‘Asenjo, for whom
thebill is named, sees a need for
such action in the academic
community. He sai , “We hope it

(the bill) will -control the excesses in

departments."

on University politics.
Dr.’ William Keefe, chairman of

‘the Political Science department

said, ‘‘I- think it's a, threat to
departmental consensus...I am
simply fearful that this will be
corrosive to departmental unity.

“The emphasis in this is the
voting a‘spect...voting can inhibit

negotiation in what is essentially a

political decision.”

Dr. Robert Marshall, Dean of CAS
doubtedthe usefulness of consen-
sus in delicate department matters.

“The whole ' point of getting
written legislation," he noted, “is
that you can’t argue with circum-
stances."

The meeting adjourned with no .

definite’ decision, except" to mee

Some of God's Children, a new
gospel choir is singing the praises
of God.

“The group sings gospel pieces
that most people know but are
arranged differently," says Paul-
ette Ma'nning, the group’s director.
“I teach it the way they can sing it
best. There’s a basic format to any
song. It’s just that you can do so
many things with it that it doesn’t
sound‘ like the same song,”
explained Manning.

Larry Woodson, the group’s I

co-director, says he joined the choir
because, “I believe in the Lord,
Jesus Christ.” Woodson said he
welcomed I an opportunity “to
praise his name.” He is optimistic
about the group’s success.
“No/thing great has happened that
we couldn’t conquer. I believe that
the best is going to come through.

“We've been asked to be on
television, and one man wanted to
sponsor us in New York. These are
just offers,” Woodson stressed.
“We haven't really sat down and
discussed them yet.”

Some of God’s Children was
recently recognized by Student

‘Government. The choir is open to

all Pitt undergraduates. No
previous singing experience is
necessary; but Manning said, “I
ask that they can sing a bit -- that
they’re not tone deaf.”

The group organized in January,
1972. “A few.of us were sitting
around talking,”
son. “There was a piano player
and we started singing.” Since

sung in Philadelphia, local chur-
ches and on campus.

1972, but was denied. Manning
felt it was because, “our constitu-
tion was not complete. We had to
rewrite it. At first they’ said they
would recognize us but wouldn’t
give us any money. Tom Bailey, of
Student Government said that was
unfair, so now we can ask for
money.”

Student Government suggested

but the group decided to remain‘

independent. “If you’re indepen-
dent you can go where you choose.
If we were under BAS we’d have to

weeks of any semester. The choir

ber added, “The University ad-
ministration has been unfair in its
dealing with" the Young Socialist
Alliance." She said the ban on a
socialist campaign rally was “an
encroachment of the right of free

LeBlanc concluded the 20 minute
rally saying, “The only way to
defend free speech is to make
vigorous use of free speech.”

In the past, Cuba has used a
‘historical salary system’ which
pegged a, worker’s income at his
highest previous salary. Even if a
worker was demoted he would
continue earning his previous
salary. The Workers Union
Congress will propose making
salaries dependant up on produc-
tion. ' 1

According to Casal, Cuba has.
experienced economic problems
stemming from inflation and a
severe labor shortage. To ease the
labor shortage, the Workers Union
Congress will modify female labor
laws and the mandatory retirement
policy. A ’ .

To relieve a critical. housing
shortage, Cuba has been building
housing projects. One such project
will house 150,000’people by'1975.
“There is a great amount of
construction." Casal said. “I
didn't turn a corner without seeing
something being built."

The Cuban government Casals
retorts has recently ‘eased con-
sumption restrictions by lowering
the rate of reinvestment, allowing a
rise in the quantity of consumer
goods. ’

science is made the plaything of
"political ideology. I don’t wish to
discuss the “balance” of your story
on the meeting which precipitated

"the letter; although it seems to me
» that when two ‘qualiﬁed Pitt profs

speak out in ‘favor of academic
freedom for “Jensenism,” this is
more newsworthy than another
stale airing of PLP’s views, which
are well known already. I was even
morestunned. though, by PLP’s

logic in their “refutation” of

“Jensenism.”

In an _exclamation-ridden dissec-
tion of Dr. Jensen's Harvard
Educational Review study, PLP
questioned “the implicit’ premise
that IQ measures intelligence.”
Instead, they maintained, IQ

probably measures other traits’

such as “docility, positive attitudes
toward school, willingness to
please school authorities, etc.”~

This is a very under-handed sort of

logic; it involved switching the '

argument to pre-determine the.

A conclusions. Even so, anyone who

has thoroughly read the Jensen
report knows that Jensen did not
base his findings on so shady an
entity as -“IQ,” but rather on a
psychological unit of measurement
which he called “g.” The qualities
inherent in “g” are the abilities to
think in abstract terms, to see how
the part implies the whole, and how
the whole can be reduced, ‘to the
part. It was on this ability to
perceive “g,’-’ not on any arbitrary

, measurements of IQ, that Jensen’s

findings were based.

. PLP, as well as most of the liberal
’ educational/establishment, has

answered a Dr. Jensen's ‘ﬁndings
with a great_amount of verbiage,
and little more. Jensen has
compiled a lengthy and impressive
list of sources to document his
study,_ and the least one could
expect would be that his conclu-
sions would be answered in a cool,
clear-headed scientiﬁc manner.

‘Instead, he has been subjected to
, physical and mental abuse,
, endless propaganda barrage, and

an

conduct that seems peculiarly’ out
of place in an academic community.

No one can be sure whether Dr.
Jensen is right.,But his ideas will
neither be proven nor disproven
until they have been thoroughly
examined in an atmosphere free
from impassioned politics. An

consistently called upon the Na-

Teach4n

Dear Ms. Sextonz‘

By almost any ‘objective’ criterion
blacks, in the main, fare worse than
whites in . American society.
According to the 1970 Censusuthe
median income in the Northeastfor
whites was $10,721 while the ﬁgure
for blacks is $7,409; 55.3% of black
households have incomes less than
$7,000 while the corresponding V
ﬁgure for whites is’ 29.5%; infant as

’mortality (1968) for blacks was 34.5

deaths per 1000 live births and for"
whites the ﬁgure was_ 19.2 deaths
per 1000 live births. For each age
category (except for the very old),
the age speciﬁc death rate for
blacks is well above that for whites.
Even if these ﬁgures come as no
surprise they should make us pause
and ask about the social processes
generating them. Controversy is
immediate; for some people these

ﬁgures are simply a fact of life, for ‘F

others they are a reﬁection of how
things should be, and for others
they indicate how much social
change is necessary. 1 I

In trying to account for these
differentials_the topicof racism is
inevitably brought up. But what is
racism? And if we can deﬁne it,
how do wejuse it to explain such‘
social phenomena? How does
racism operate in the labor market?
In tlfe housing market? And how
does it operate in the academic
market place? Particularly, does it
operate here at Pitt? Should it be

eradicated? Can it be eradicated,

and if so, how?

These are allissues we would like
to thoughtfully explore and ex-
change ideas about. To this end we

philosophy and the need of
accurate reporting by this news-
paper. -However, with one point of
the letter, I take issue.

An analogy between racism and a ‘

poison drug was made; an analogy
that for some purposes may be
deemed valid. But the unlimited
extension of this analogy may be
more harmful than racism itself.

The Progressive Labor Party, in its
letter, advocates the prohibition ‘of

the teaching of Jensenism, or any ’

racially tinged thesis ‘ on, this
campus, thereby neglecting V com-
pletely the major tenets of
academic freedom. The purpose of
a university is not to teach and
expound on matters the student
already knows,
opposing as well as concurring
views in an objective manner so
that the student may question and
think, and then come to conclusions
based on reason instead of mere
gut reaction. The Progressive
Labor Party seems to be so caught
up in their conception of truth that
they fear any introduction of ideas
they consider false. If all groups
were allowed to restrict curriculum
as they advocate, no controversial
ideas would be allowed on campus.

I would not advocate the teaching
of .I_ensen’s theses in elementary or
even high schools, but the
exclusion of such teaching on the
university level would "be an
injustice to students. We must
assume that by the time- an
individual reaches the university,
his thought process has matured
enough to view what is taught in an

objective manner and will not‘

merely be swayed by any particular
point of view. .

> Semple Sf. Co-op-39¢o head

l3Y DAVE MAJERNIK

Everyone is talking about high
food prices these days, but few

people are doing anything about.‘
Some of the people in

them.
Pittsburgh who are doing some-
thing about food prices belong to
the Semple Street Food coopera-
tive. '

The Co-op, now with over 650
members, opened its doors at the
corner of Semple and Ward Streets
in Oakland last December. Four
employees and member volunteers
assist customers during store hours
from 12 noon until 6:00 p.m. on
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,
and Friday, 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.

on Tuesday, and 10:00 a.m. to 5:00

p.m. on Saturday.

According to Marc Schwartz, a
founder of the Co-op, the stock-
holders_, or members, come from a
variety of backgrounds and include
college‘ students and nearby
Oakland residents.

Membership in the Co-op costs
five dollars per share, and
members may purchase more than
one share. In addition, a_ member
must work in the store one hour per

month if single and two hours if.

married, or pay a one or two dollar
fee to be relieved of the work.
Schwartz noted that the food
cooperative differs from a regular
corporate organization in one major
aspect. ' “The Co-op principle is
one member, one vote. No matter

how -many shares a person owns,

he only gets one yote,” he said.
_Members get approximately.a 10

l per cent discount on the store's

merchandise, and also get to
decide store policy at the member-

ship meetings held four times a

year. Non-members. can also
purchase at the Co-op.

“We encourage our customers to
become members,“ said Schwartz.
“Because it is rediculous, not to
since you can save the $5.00 cost of
membership in a short time
through the membership dis-
count." H ,

An example of prices of items at
the Co-op is that of iceberg lettuce.
When it was selling for 89 cents in
supermarkets, the Co-op had it for
39 cents. Schwartz refused to
compare in detail Co-op prices to
supermarket prices because, he
maintained, food prices change so
frequently that such information
could quickly become outdated.‘

“We’re not competing with "the
supermarkets, we're just‘ cooper-
ating. We don’t sell very many
items they (10 anyway,” said
Schwartz. . " _

What the Co-op does sell,
however, is basic whole and
unprocessed foods such as grains
(spring wheat,‘ buckwheat, soy-
beans), seeds, beans, nuts, fruits,

vegetables, and natural sweeteners
(honey, molasses and maple
syrup). The store also sells cheese
without artificial coloring, eggs,
unfiltered apple cider and juice,
unprocessed peanut butter, and
many other items sold in a natural
food store.

“We don’t sell any meat because

it is too expensive and we don’t.

have a freezer ”, said Schwartz.
1

“Besides, most of our members are .

vegetarians.”

_ The interior of the Co-op has the
appearance of.an old-time general
store. There are two vegetable
coolers, a cheese case, and an egg
cooler along three of the _walls.,

Worm Depictions of Frozen Life

BY HARRIS LEVY

. Back To. The Top of the World

By Hans Ruesch
202 pp. New York:
Scribner & Sons $6.95

Hans Ruesch’s Back to the Top of
the World is a novel about Eskimo
life.’ A sequel to Ruesch’s Top of
the World [1950], this marvelous
novel follows the adventures of
Papik and his wife, Vivi.

Ruesch, lives in Switzerland, but
has written his ﬁve novels in
English. In Back to the Top, he has
told an exciting plausible story.

Papik and Vivi and (as their
daughter estimates) about 200
others live further north than any
other people. They can go a whole
year without meeting another
human being. ‘

It is a hard, nomadic life for the
frigid duo. Ruesch describes their
“normal hazards”-icequakes and
icebreaks, freezing in the winter,
drowning in the summer, starva-
tion, bears, and their own spirits’
capriciousness. Papik and Vivi
must sometimes slaughter their
dogs to prevent starvation.

Charles

Although Papik and "Vivi hope for
a son to help with the hunting, they
reluctantly raise a daughter,
leaving her out in the cold to die

once, but then reconsidering.

Several years later a son is born
and the novel follows the family
until he is in his late teens.

The family has several disastrous
meetingiwith whites. They try to
impose their values on the
Eskimos. A white minister
preaches communal property,
[which the Eskimos have always
practiced] but this doesn’t apply to
whites.

‘ Papik’s family temporarily suc-

cumb’s to the temptations of the
white man's way of life but in the
end opt for the difficult but
satisfying Eskim'o life. 0

Ruesch describes Eskimo life in
detail, hunting practices, supersti-

tions, child-raising, and hiber-
nating.
The author has also shown

considerable skill in showing life
and events from the Eskimo point
of view. The story is believable and
enriched with fascinating informa-
tive detail. The reader will

STUDENT GOVERNMENT SYMPATHETIC I
TO STUDENT MEAT-EATERS

Regis Kaufman, president of SG,_at Pitt, lastnight concurred.
with a group of protesting students. The group, calling themselves
Students That Eat All Kinds (STEAK) have demanded that govern-
ment action be taken, to lower the high cost of meat. Many stud-
ents are no longer capable of meeting the rising costs, of meat eat-
ing and have involuntarily turned to vegetarianism. "All student
consumers have been adversely affected,” the group beefed, "Oak-
land residents, dormitory tenants. commuters and fraternity house

members.“

||||||l|ll|l|I||ll||'-'

SG Board, headed by Kaufman, proved sympathetic to student

demands and agreed to lend a helping hand to hungry students.

Free.Meat will be distributed at the Student Government monthly
meeting, promised the Board. "We want all students to know that
we’re here to help. No problem is too small for SG to handle.”

“The meeting, to be held Nov. 7th at 8 p.m. in..the lower lobby » A

sympathize with the Eskimos, who,

although they ‘must bend their"

morals for the sake of the family’s
survival, have fewer vices than the
whites" in the ‘novel. V

Ruesch’s description of a newborn
boy denumerates the traits needed
for survival on the ice. He had:

“A stocky body and blunt hands
designed to retain heat, large jaws
-prepared for strong teeth, close-
lying ears and ﬂat feature to foil
frostbite, the Mongolic fold over
deep-set slit-eyes to reduce the
exposed surface, narrow nose
channels to forewarm the ‘inhaled
a1r.’’ ’ 

foregoing any stylistic-innovations.

The wording is occasionally awk- A.
ward. Sometimesthequality of his -

writing is diminished of his writing
by his frequent use of slang.

The Eskimo’s speak about them-
selves in the third person in the
same fine language generally
found in the descriptive passages.

This novel is not distinguished by

its style but by its engrossing,-
informative story which the author
uses to make comments on the life
of all men.

The tables have been reversed for
tomorrow’s Pitt-Syracuse clash at
Pitt Stadium. For the first time in
many years, Pitt has been rated an
overwhelming favorite for a foot-
ball game.

The oddsmakers say that- the
Panthers will be 17 points better
t-han Ben Schwartzwalder’s troops
when they take the field at 1:30. It
is Syracuse that is seeking its ﬁrst
win of the season. -

What does a coach do when his
team is 0-7? “I considered slitting

my throat,” said Schwartzwalder,

“but I decided against it."
Injuries have depleted a Syra-

. cuse squad that didn’t have very

much to begin with. “We have had
more injuries than normal,” said
the 65-year-old mentor.‘ “We lost

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

Sorry  
Ben...

Oh how soon we forget. Last year it took the University of Pittsburgh
half the season to win a ball game. With a record of 1-10, Pitt shared
the honors for being the worst squad in the nation with teams like
Colorado. State and, well there wasn’t a major college team around that

didn’t win at least one.

But right now, that’s where Ben Schwartzwalder and the Syracuse 1
Orange stand.‘ They are 0-7_and the possibility’ that they just might
finish the season without a victory to show for their efforts is rapidly _

becoming a reality.

You’ve just got to feel sorry for Ben. He's been the head coach at

Syracuse for a. quarter of a century.

In fact, ‘at Tuesday’s press

luncheon Ben spoke to the crowd in a rather joking manner about his

predicament.

He joked about his turnover rate.

He joked about

psyching his team up for the games. He joked about the fact the_ only.
consistency his team has shown is the consistency to lose ball games.

“Tell Johnny Majors not to be a pig.”

Well, that’s just too bad Ben, because I sincerely hope that the Pitt
Panthers score so many touchdowns that you won’t want to take the .
field next week against Holy Cross. That game looks like the only real
opportunity that the Orange will get to win a game. ’ . B " ’

If Schwartzwalder had intended some psychological ploy in his 3
remarks over the phone on Tuesday, they aren’t going to work. ‘The
statistics of the past six games speak louder.

Syracuse has been everyone’s doormat this year and I hope Pitt will

R wipe their feel thoroughly over them tomorrow._ After all, we here at
Pitt know how Ben must feel and it’s about time that the Panthers ran

I upthe score for a change. It does wonders for the team ego to win by
30 points with some regularity. '

Three or four years ago (I can’t really remember when) I was listening
to a Penn State game in whichthe Nittany Lions were romping over one
of their usual undermatched opponents. There wasn’t much time left

in the game and Penn State had 'ju

around midﬁeld.

st received the ball via a turnover

"Naturally the sporting thing to do is run the clock out in such a
situation. Joe Paterno probably had that in mind when he sent in his

third string quarterback.

Solthis kid went in and ran an off tackle run on first down, but then
came back on the next play and threw a bomb for another Penn State
score. Paterno was outraged on the sidelines. When Penn State got
the ball back againon the first play after the kickoff, Paterno. sent his

A fourth string quarterback in to run out the clock. ;

That’s what I want to "see tomorrow at Pitt Stadium.

I want to see Tony Dorsett break a few records in the first half and not
have to play at all in the second. I want some freshman to get in at
quarterback, or better yet, let all the freshmen quarterbacks get some
experience during the second half. Give the starters a breather, ’cause
they're going to needit for next week. .. -

It's a shame that Ben Schwartzwalder has to fade away one such a
pathetic note. Gook luck to Syracuse next week against Holy Cross:

' they'll need it. And if the Orange can’t beat them, well it’s too bad

they don't play Army.

For those students interested in attending the Pitt Hockey Club
games this year, the Club would sincerely appreciate it if all tickets
would be purchased in advance on campus. That way the Club can
make a few bucks- and keep hockey alive here at the University. '

 ..At the Pitt summer football camp
“' f7'in Jo-hnstown way back in August,

 his new team was going to win one
ballgame in ’73, there were very

to entertain the upperclassmen and

Abruptly, in the middle of the

Hjbehind him.

He was wearing a

Perry (his replacement) was hurt
and could barely walk. I had to stay
in."i

And, his ‘staying in’ was not
because there was no one else

around. Stoner graded 81 per cent.

for the game, one of the highest
grades offensive line coach Joe
Avazzano has given out this year.

“Reynold plays with a lot of.

pain,” Avazzano noted. “It’s a
credit to him that he plays. He
sacriﬁces a lot. He’s not the most
super athlete on this team, but he
gets by on excellent effort and
technique. He’s also one of the
most enthusiastic guys on the
team. He’s always jumping
around." _ ~

Stoner agrees. ‘‘I’m not the
fastest or the strongest guy on the
team," he said, “so I have to ask a
lot of questions and make sure I’m

at the right place at the right time..

“Avazzano is a good coach. He
gets the most out of his ballplayers.
And as a unit the offensive line is a
pretty ‘close bunch. Ray Olsen
[guard] is the big clown. With his
insanity, he keeps everybody sane.
Dﬁe Wannstedt [tackle] is one of
the best offensive linemen in the
_country. He makes me look alot
better, playing next to him.
“With Mike (Carey) anchoring us
in the middle and with Dave
Blandino-'-he’s the subtle comedian
of the group--at the other tackle,
we're pretty good.»

“We have a bet with Avazzano"

this week,” he noted. “If we ‘rush

for 200 ‘yards Saturday against '

Syracuse, he's going to cook us
lasajgna. He's a damn good cook
too.

“Syracuse reminds me of last

Women Swimmers

Tomorrow marks the beginning of
a new era in Pitt Women's Varsity
swimming. In their opening meet
with Ashland College. the “Pir-
anhas" hope to ‘prove that the
major change at Pitt is not only in
football. The women's swimming
season has been expanded, run-

/ ning from October through March,

aiming the team towards the
esatern and national champion-
ships.

Another factor in the women's
favor is the benefit of two coaches.
Mrs. Virginia Grindle, returning

from a successful season last year .

is being assisted by Ms. Kate
Mathison, a Pitt graduate in
physical therapy and a former

swimmer. Grindle expressed
optimism about this meet in
particular and ‘the season in
general.

“I am pleased with the quality
and aggressiveness of the swim-
mers on the team this year. The
returning girls have shown marked
improvement and the freshmen are
certainly holding their own. We
are facing this season on a one
meetvat a time basis. "We are out to
win each meet this year, rather
than just try to make a good
showing, as in previous years. I’m
looking forward to a successful
meet this weekend in Ashland.”

Newly elected team captain
Mamie Heretick shares Grindle’s
optimism._ “Our girls look really

TORONTO, AP--Aside from the
prospects of ,p1ayoff money or
contract bonuses, members of the
National Hockey Leagu Toronto
Maple Leafs have a change ‘at

year. They have some potential but

"can’t seem to put it together. We

can’t afford, to look ahead. Right
now, Syracuse is the rest of the
season for us,” ‘Stoner said. V
Hopefully, Ren-Ren will be able to‘
enjoy his lasagna on Wednesday,
with the fifth Pitt win under his belt

and without the -help of a shoulder

harness."

A STOIIBI‘ ‘Braces’ Himself   apen At Ashland

strong this year,” explained the
pharmacy student. “The past
month has involved many hours of
long and diligent practives. I feel
very confident’that this time and
energy will prove rewarding when
the Pitt “Piranhas” take on
Ashland.”

Heretick was a key swimmer last
season, representing'Pitt at the
women’s intercollegiate Eastern
championship meet in West Ches-
ter, Pa. Accompanying her at
Easterns and returning this year
are co-captain Sue Price, Anna-
marie Crelli, Kitty Martin and
Anne Wallisch. ,

Other returning veterans include
Eloise Kester, Sharon Schoelkopf,
Donna Kell and diver Sandee Lipp.
The team welcomes the return of
Glynnis Lyons and Linda Bender,
who missed last ’ season to
concentrate on their ’ studies.
Incoming freshmen include diver
Bert Snoznik, Vicki Coleman,
Michele Chamberlain and Michele
Knoll.

But the surprise factor of the team
this year, is freshman Angela
Lopez, who has just returned from
Belgrade, Yugoslavia where she
competed in the World Games.
Lopez should indeed prove to be an
asset to the team.

Taking all into consideration, the

Pitt “Piranhas" should look
forward to a very successful
season.

Star

$8,500 in prize money awarded the I

“three stars" of each game. .
The stars most valuable players of
each game are given points which

are totaled after segments of the

season.

There are five segments, with the H

leader winning $1,000 and the
runner-up $500.‘ The over-all

' leader at the end ofthe season wins

another $1,000. ,

After the first 10 games of the
NHL season, rookie forward Inge
Hammarstrom leads the Leafs in
the prize running, with Paul
Henderson the runner-up.
