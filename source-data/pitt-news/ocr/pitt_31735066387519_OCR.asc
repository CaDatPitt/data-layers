PHILADELPHIA — A decision
is likely this week on whether the
$2.5 million Constitution Pavil-
ion will be torn down after host-
ing a summerlong series of events
honoring the bicentennial of the
Constitution, one official says.

City tourism officials want the
open-air, metal-and—fabric struc-
ture to stay atleast a little longer,
and, are scheduled to meet with

 

National Park Service officials
Thursday.

Hobart Cawood, superinten-
dent of Independence National
Historical Park, said a decision
Thursday is important because
winter is approaching.

”When this wasidesigned, ‘it
was designed for five months, not
for five years,” -Cawood‘ said.

”We didn't anticipate we'd have »

Thames were introduced as the
nominees to the crowd of over
100 people in attendance.

A lecture was given on the
topic of male and female relation-
ships. Dr. Ellie El|is—Wright talked
for 50 minutes about the respon-

‘ sibilities of males and females in

a relationship, .

After the lecture there was a
question and answer session. The
lecture, Sims said, "Went very
well. It was a topic that everyone
wanted to discuss. We want to

Cawood said he has mixed
feelings and plenty of questions
about any plan to keep the pavil-

ion in the park, where it hosted ‘

a dinner for members of Congress
and other glittery bicentennial
events across the street from the
Liberty Bell.

”We could live with a tem-
porary structure for a little longer

Also discussed at the meeting
was the QPA Program, a new
program to inform students about
minority scholarships and finan-
cial aid.

Reminders were made to the
membership about the Minority
Jobs Fair on November 12 and
the performance of African Danc-
ing Masks, a dance and poetry

want pavilion to stay

We the People 200 Inc., the
chief organizers of the city's Con-
stitution celebration, erected the
pavilion last spring for bicenten-
nial events. Its removal was due
to begin Nov. 1.

”Why not just try it out for a
while?” said Meryl Levitz, a vice
president at the Philadelphia
Convention and Visitors Bureau,

which has backed off earlier sug-"

sessions scheduled for Tuesday
and Wednesday, the House is ex-

Senate Republican Whip F.

Paoli parachuter dies
in accident on bridge

FAYETTEVILLE, W.Va. — A
Pennsylvania man died Saturday
after his parachute failed to open
during an annual sky‘ divers’
jump from the New River Gorge

nessed the dive.

Its ”response has been an ineffec-

AIDS.” ,

Suzanne Phillips of Brooklyn,
N.Y., a medical student who
works with AIDS victims, carried
a bumper sticker reading ”Fight
AIDS, not people with AIDS.”

”I can't do anything for the pa-

Activists began their day Sun-

the unfurling of a 7,000—pound
quilt bearing the names, personal
effects and, in some cases, the
ashes of victims of AIDS.

The quilt bears 1,920 panels
made by companions or relatives
of people who have died from
the disease. Among the panels on
the quilt were familiar names: ac-

Filmmaker in town to

By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

. It is difficult to try to critique a film like

"We Were So Beloved. Really, what is

there to be said of its delicate and mov-
ing subject matter of Jews who've sur-

vived the Holocaust and immigrated to .

America? The sorrow and pity is enough;

. l i the horror does not need to be publicized

 

.4 .,g_, ...,_...,.,._ ...

again. Rather, the focus here is on the

V filmmaking itself.

New York independent filmmaker
Manny Kirchheimer was at the Fulton
Theatre yesterday to introduce his

I ' documentary. He interviewed mainly his

family and neighbors who reside in Man-
hattan's Washington Heights, the area in
which many Jews settled after their im-
migration to this country. '

There will never be a rea-
wakening of the German na-

tion without the realization

of its Jewish population.
— Manny Kirchheimer

if Kirchheimer, like many thousands of‘

others from his German homeland, fled

- ‘to_America in the 19305 to escape Hitler's
persecution. 3
 Many of those interviewed were as

close to the director as his own father,
while others were as prominent as New

— York Times editorialist Max Frankel.

The documentary is filmed in a
question-answer format, using head shots
of the speakers with wartime snapshots
occasionally mixed in. The technique us-
ing the old photos is very effective; the
viewer sees the speakers at the time of
WWII and hears the voices tell of their

‘, time _in Germany. The result is a very

realistic and convincing testimony.
Those interviewed speak not so much

of their New York neighborhood but talk

more about what it was like to live in Ger-

’, many both before and after Hitler came

to power.

Kirchheimer offers provocative ques-
tions and asks his father, if he were not
a Jew, would he have hidden those who

i were? The father's response is an honest

lln.O‘II
The filmmaker later added, during a

post—film discussion that he believed his
father but also knew the man gave in eas-
ily. Kirchheimer said that his father would
probably have hidden the Jews from Hi-
t|er’s men, if put into that situation.

Kirchheimer has fittingly added the
music of German classical composers
Bach and Strauss, which helps break up
the monotony of plain dialogue.

One woman interviewed tells of her at-
tempt to reach America in the late 1930s.
The ocean liner on which she was a pas-
senger reached Cuba, but the boat was
not permitted to dock. It was there, she
explains, that she first heard the Spanish
expression ”manana” (tomorrow), when
asked when the passengers could leave
the boat.

After a week of attempting to gain port
of entry, the boat then went to Belgium.
There, the woman was separated from her
family, never to see them again. She was
one of the lucky, though; she made it to
America, away from the persecution.

Kirchheimer shows distressful excerpts
of Hitler's Mein Kampf, as an attempt to
figure out what the ruler had in mind in
using the German hatred of Jews as the
force through which he could accomplish
his goals.

Some comments are shocking in this
film. One is Frankel’s feeling of being left

‘out when, as a-six-year—o|d child, he

could not be in the Hitler youth parades
since he was a Jew. This, as_.Franke| ex-

- *pla’ins,fw.as,his'yiew as a~~c’hi’l‘d an‘d"much1’
~ has'changed'=-since then. ‘ »  '

Kirchheimer strives. fordetail in his film.

-This is evident is his lengthy camera pans ’

of the Washington Heights neighborhood
or his close-ups of his'fami|y’s passports.
He notes the large, red letter ”J” stamped
by the German government in each one
to firmly indicate the family was Jewish.

The director relates an interesting com-
ment in the film which serves as a point
on which to reflect: there will never be
a reawakening of the German nation
without the realization of its Jewish popu-
lation. '

Those of you who viewed We Were 50
Beloved not only saw a finedocumentary

of what it was like to be both German and g

a Jew. You were able to catch a special
peek at this film, as it has yet to be
released.

_ Director Manny Ki_rchheimer an-
nounced that the documentry will also be
available on Videocassettes. The film is
scheduled to be released early this winter.

Going baroque?

If so, this society is for you

By Frances Sansig

Contributing Editor ,
The Renaissance & Baroque Society of

Pittsburgh presented an extraordinary

concert Sunday night, performing before

an audience of about 1,000 in Synod Hall

of St. Paul's Cathedral.

The Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra,
Canada's baroque orchestra on original
instruments, played selections from Vival-
di, Pietro Locatelli and Francesco
Geminiani.

The instrument that perfectly provided
a theme ”backdrop” for the strings. was
a French harpischord borrowed from the

music department of the University of
Pittsburgh. It is a copy of a I741 instru-
ment crafted by Etienne Blanchet.
Under the animated directon ofJean La-
mon, also a violinist,» the orchestra per-

formed three concertos during the first '
. half of the program: Concerto grosso in

D Minor, op.3, no. 77 from L’Estro Ar-
monico by Antonio Vivaldi; Concerto
grosso, op. 7, no. 6 ”ll pianto d’Arianna”
by Locatelli, an_d Concerto Grosso ”La
FolIia”, by Francesco Geminiani.

Besides the harpischord and seven vio-
lins, two Violas, two cellos and a violone
comprised the orchestra.

Staff Writer

Graffiti, Oakland's chic
night spot, plays host to the
reggae group Mutabaruka this
coming Monday night.
Mutabaruka was named ”best
reggae dub poet” at the 1986
International Reggae Awards
in Chicago last May.

Mutabaruka Just released his
third album,The Mystery Un-
folds, on Shanachie Records
label and is doing a coast to
coast U.S. tour.

With his ovv.n_ sense of style,

1 he packs ad‘;-sociopolitical

punch with his rap and lyrics.
His songs range from the
haunting electronic ”Bun
Dung Babylon”(Burn Down
Babylon), its message being to
destroy corrupt political sys-
tems, to ”The Leaders Speak,”
which is a start/stop rhythm

rampage. The title cut of his.
_ latest album, The Mystery Un-

folds, explores past prophesy
for an explanation of current
events.

Mutabaruka also employs
poetry by folks like Allen Gins-

. berg. and Gregory Corso to
tease. the listener into ending-_
_p_assivit_y._ J  ‘

Mutabaruka’s debut LP,
Check It, was released in
1983, and it immediately
jumped to the toptof the reg-
gae charts. His second album,
Outcry, goes a step beyond his
first by making lots of
wisecracks. Mutabaruka lash-
es out against P.W. Botha, not
to mention famine, nuclear
contamination and Jamaican
emigration.

The show at Graffiti starts at
8 p.m tonight; also appearing
with Mutabaruka are the reg-
gae groups Chill Factor and
Norris Reid.

The flying nun is still in

By Kiley Armstrong

Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — Sally Field has
fared well on the choppy sea of
stardom, but she says it still takes
guts to put her work before th
public. '

The productive Academy
Award-winning actress is about to
deliver a baby in December and
has two new romantic comedies
coming out: Surrender, out this
month; and Punchline, out early
next year.

”Some people say that come-
dy is harder,” she said. ”Proba—

.bly it's harder because when you

fall, you fall so broadly — without
any sort of saving grace. When
you fall in drama it seems a little
more graceful. When you fall in
comedy, you splat.” \

Such insight is squeezed from
a lifetime spent in show business:
as the daughter of Paramount ac-
tress Maggie Field Mahoney; the
stepdaughter of lock Mahoney, a
star of Westerns and two Tarzan
films; and now, as the wife of
producer Alan Greisman (Fletch,
Modern Problems and ’night,
Mother.

Field also seems entrenched in
her domestic role with her close-

, cropped hair and casual materni-

ty clothes — the flip side" of her
provocative pose on the cover of
a 1986 Playboy magazine. Al-
ready the mother of Peter, 17,
and Eli, 14, she plans to ”play it
by ear” about ending her next
maternity leave.

”Even in the past, I would only
do a picture every one to two
years,” she said. ’’I did two pic-
tures this year, which was un-
usual for me.”

What's it like to go back onto
the set after such a hiatus?

’’It’s always hard,” she said.‘

”And every actor I've ever talked
to feels this way.

”You always, the first day of
shooting, are a nervous wreck.
You're trembling all over, be-
cause you're saying, ’I once knew
how to do this but I've forgotten
it now,’ ” she said. ”Then you get
up and you start to work and it
sort of goes away.”

Such admissions of human
frailties have brought her grief in
the past. Critics and fans alike
groaned after she gushed during
her 1985 Oscar acceptance
speech: ”You like me. You real-
ly like me."

But in an August interview,
Field's own favorite actress,
Katharine Hepburn, expressed a
similar revelation. Hepburn said
she was surprised that the au-
dience was not out to shoot her
after she sang in the 1970 Broad-
way production of Coco.

’’It was a warm  discovery to
me. And I thought, ’They must
like me. ‘That's why they're
here.’ ”

After‘ hearing Hepburn’s re-
marks, Field laughed heartily.
”Aha. There it is. She said it much
more clearly than I did. Had I said
that, I wouldn't be in. trouble.”

The 40-year-old actress began
her career in 1965 on television
as the perky surfer in Cidget." Af—'
ter soaring in her second silly sit-
com, The Flying Nun (1967-70),
Field longed for meatier roles.

In 1976, she earned critical
plaudits opposite Jeff Bridges in
Stay Hungry. That same year, she
won an Emmy award for the TV

movie Sybil.
Then she reverted to lighter fare
with the Burt Reynolds action-

TheCars  

By Larry McShane

' Associated Press Writer

. NEW YORK — After three
years apart and an assortment of
solo projects, the Cars reunited to
follow up their platinum smash,
Heartbeat City — a project that
relocated the band in London for
most of a year. a

Door to Door returns the
Boston group somewhat to its
bar—band roots, with two of the

 

cuts dating back to a session for
the band's first album and most
of the songs done live in the stu-
dio, says songwriter/singer Ric
Ocasek.

”Leave or Stay,” the first cut
done for the new album, ”is a
club song from our club days,”
Ocasek recalled in an interview
at a Manhattan studio where the

Cars were rehearsing for a world.

tour — their first shows since
1984.

”That song is like a trip into the
past," said Ocasek, dressed in
black from head to toe. ”We used
to open up the show with that in
bars.” V

The song was recorded in one
afternoon — an indication of the
relaxed, speedy sessions which
produced the new record in three
months at a Manhattan studio,
Ocasek said. A second song, ”Ta
Ta Wayo Wayo,” also dates back
to the late 1970s.

  THEii>iTr News, Manda’, ociatiiér 12, TI937

The sound on Door to Door,
while featuring less of the over-
dubs and electronics of the past,
is still easily identifiable as the
Cars.

For Heartbeat City they head-
ed to Britain and worked with
producer Mutt Lange for eight
months. The resulting album
produced four hit singles, but

-there was no rush to follow up.

In the three-year interim, Oca-
sek worked on his solo record,

recapture originality on latest album

This Side of Paradise; bas-
sist/vocalist Benjamin Orr
released his successful album The
Lace; guitarist Elliot Easton com-
pleted his solo Change No
Change LP; keyboardist Greg
Hawkes composed a pair of film
scores; and drummer David
Robinson worked on tracks with
Semper Fi, a local Boston band.

Once reassembled, ”every-
body was thoroughly enthusias-
tic about coming back and
making the records,” said Oca-
sek. ’’It seemed like just yesterday
we had started the band.”

Despite all the songwriters in
the band, Ocasek wrote all the
material for Door to Door — a
task he's handled since the Cars’
debut album in 1978.

While the Cars are set to start
a world tour this month, Ocasek
is also looking forward to the
release later this year of Hair
Spray, the new film by cult movie
favorite John Waters.

’’I played the part of a raving
beatnik painter with Pia Zadora,
and we’re‘in, this sort of tiny
said Ocasek, who
returned to his home state of
Maryland for the filming. ”lt’s
quite funny.”

The collaboration with Waters
came close toproducing the ul-
timate video oddity for the new
album's first single, ”You Are the
Girl”: Waters directs and the
300—pound transvestite Divine
plays the lead role.’

Bernhard

brings wit
to town

By Susan Washburn

Entertainment Editor

Dressed in’ black with her hair
teased and sprayed, Sandra Bern-
hard looked more like a Bon Jovi
groupie than a successful come-
dienne.

The hour—and-a-half long show
not only gave Sandra Bernhard a
chance to perform, but also the
opportunity to take a look at Pitts-.
burgh residents.

The show opened with Bern-
hard poking fun at heavy metal
bands as well as their groupies
and went on to cover everything
from Christmas to vegetarian air-

plane food. Following her mono- ,

logue, Bernhard allowed‘ the

_audience to come forward and

ask her questions.

While the monologue was fun-
ny in itself, the dialogue with the
audience was outstanding. Bern-
hard answered some questions
honestly while others she used as
a stepping stone for her own
stories.

The second half of the program

panied by four sonnets.

If Columbus could
only see us today

In 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered America, a new
world of dreams and resources. But now, in 1987, The United
States of America has lostmany of her dreams (natural resources
are being depleted at unprecedented rates.) We, as one—third
of the world population, carelessly consume two-thirds of the
world's resources. We abuse the natural beauty of the land-
scapewith litter and strip mining. - '

It is time to step back and realize that not only are there many -

people in need here and now, but there is a future to consider
also. It is necessary to conserve not only our own resources
but those throughout the world for two reasons. First, to "keep
America beautiful” butmost importantly to preserve the future
of the human race. If 495 years ago Columbus had discovered
the dirty slums and littered countrysides which characterize
America today, he probably would have turned his ships

 LETTER .
Religious maturity

Marc Duchin's editorial on Oct.9 explains his drift to atheism as
the result of "the reality of society.” He opposes these "mature" mores
to "child|ike" religion.

But is society really mature?» In America last year (I assume that our
culture is what he means) 27 percent of people 1.8‘ to 24 years old
attended a college or university. Forty percent of the population at-
tended religious services regularly (not the vast majority of that he
assumes). Nearly 18 million people read Readers’ Digest, and near-
ly five million read National Enquirer. The student next to you is there
because of his or her class schedule, not because of exceptional good-
ness or intellectual "maturity" [  ] If society's interests are either
amoral or actively evil, then its views on ”child’ish" religion may be
wrong. -

' whatever

Over the past few months, I've
experienced a change of heart

which has really thrown me. If-

you'd have told me 10 years ago
this would happen, I'd have said,
"No way.” But at the risk of
ridicule and censure, I'll "admit it
here, now and without shame —
I've had it with city living and I'm
headed for the suburbs.
Though it has, at times, embar-
rassed me to say so, my roots are
in suburbia. I grew up in an area
where traffic was just the name of
an old British rock group, and to

' be street-wise meant that you

knew how to get to the mall and
back without losing your way.
Admittedly, I'd been raised in
a comfortable home on a lazy
street with lots of trees, birds and
other kids to mess around with.
But when I finally left for college
a number of years ago, I vowed
that I'd never return to the subur-

‘ ban life I knew as akid.

To me, suburbia was too slow,
not hip. And for a kid with his
heart set on a writing career, it ap-
peared to be devoid of the stuff
from which great literature is
made. What would provide the
creative spark I craved? Shopping
malls? Spotless burger joints?

In college, I transformed myself
into an urbanite of sorts —,a real
"George of the Asphalt Jungle,"

- as a friend once put it. If I wasn't

an urbanite by background, I cer-
tainly was one at heart. At least
that's what I told myself.

But to_ twist a cliche, you can
take the boy out of the suburbs,
but you can never really take the
suburbs out of the boy. As a
writer, this was my curse. I'd have
to. live with the fact that, unlike
poet Allen Ginsberg, I'd never be
like the guys who drank turpen-
tine in Paradise Alley. Who wants
to do that anyway?

There's love and peace in the
world today!

I'm certainly not one for sap.
I'm crude in manner and I'm
notorious for writing about
sucks worst. ' In
response to a reader's request,
|’ve»decided to try and write
about nothing but good things.
And if you get bored, you can al-
ways read that Sewald guy. Oh,
happy day! And let the joyous
celebration begin.. A

0 Michael Jackson has said his
mission in life is to save the chil-
dren of the world. That's so sweet

beloved) SGB president (whose
name I'm not going to use be-
cause it would be unfair because
I'm not naming everybody else
on the SG B) has honestly been an
asset to the campus this year. Af-
ter looking at some of his cam-
paign promises and those he
fulfilled, he stacks up pretty well
(except for the under—2I night
club which I can't mention‘ be-
cause that would be bad). But it's
about time somebody finally
gives recognition to the entire
Student Government Board.

JEFF SEWALD
BETWEEN me Lines

For some reason, the past few
months have awakened me from
my urbanite'sfantasy. I'm really
tired of the crowds. I'm tired of
the noise. I'm tired of accepting
the fact that everything, from get-
ting a hamburger at a fast food
restaurant to parking my car, has
to be armajor challenge.

One evening, while-visiting
friends in deepest, darkest subur-
bia, something strange and won-
derful happened.

I was standing at a curb watch-
ing a bunch of children play wif-
fle ball in a neighbor's backyard.

I studied one of the kids for a
while. He was of slight build, tall
and lanky, with a set of feet that

had obviously jumped out in

in high school. .

One of the other kids, I ob-

followed around this stocky little
guy who possessed what seemed
to be a natural gift for verbal ex-
pression, though thoroughly un-
restrained and not altogether
modest. The two could have
been my friend Drew and I,
respectively.

As I watched the group further,
similarities to other characters

proud to announce Crazy Nights,
Kiss’s long—awaited album is hot
off the press. Wow! After all these
years, Kiss can still crank ’em out.

One of the reasons that it's
taken so long for this album to be
released is because Gene Sim-

busy producing albums for

All in All, Kiss has been around

These dedicated musicians have
paid their dues. They take pride

The first single off the album is
”Crazy Crazy Nights.” This one
isn't just hot, it's steamin’. The
video for ”Crazy Crazy Nights”
was released two weeks ago on
MTV and it has already made a
niche for itself. It kicks more ass
than an old donkey.

I have to warn you about
another song called ”Bang Bang

sounds like it's going straight to
the top of the charts to camp out

The tracks ”Good Girl Gone

their Animalize LP. These tunes

measure up but‘ they just don't

them into the smash hit category.
The song ”When Your Walls

porating such cliches as:

-Liar, liar got your pants on fire é

they're pleasing to my taste, it's

THE PITT NEWS

The Pitt Women's Volleyball
team travelled to the Tennessee
Classic Tournament this past
weekend. The Lady Panthers im-
proved their record to an impres-
sive 21-2 by winning the
tournament.

Pitt defeated three power-
houses from the South: Tennes-
see, Texas Tech, and Florida. The

Lady Panthers have now won 13
matches in a row. Pitt opened the
tournament with a h_ard-fought
win over Tennessee with Pitt stag-
ing a major comeback and win-
ning the match 3-1.

Pitt then faced Texas Tech and
won 3-0 over one of the highly
regarded Southwest Conference
teams. -

In the championship match,
the Lady Panthers went up
against the Lady Gators of Flori-

 

da, which is one-of the top teams
in the South. After splitting the
first two games (15—7,3—15), Pitt
and Florida were even at 12-12
when Florida was awarded a
point because head coach Shel-
ton Collier was flagrantly arguing
a disputed call. Collier said,”That
could have cost us the game and
possibly the match, but a good
team can make up for something
like that and I certainly appreciat-
ed mine for doing so.”

Pitt came back to win 15-13 in
what Collier called”The most im-
portant game of our season.” The

Lady Panthers went on to win the

fourth and final game 15-9.
Collier said,”We have some
great competitors on our team
right now. I feel that's the main
factor in our wins, our intensity
and our competitiveness.”
Strong performances for Pitt
came from Denise Frawley and
Lisa Stewart. Collier said/‘They

 

played great. They had the two . if
top performances of any players‘.
at the tournament. Before, they .'

were good spikers, butthey have
worked real hard and are ‘now
great players. They can be as

good as any two players in the_.

country on a given day.”

of opportunity. We couldn't do it,

A bewildered Lou Holtz,
head coach of the Notre Dame
Fighting Irish, said it all in one
sentence.

”Pitt played a perfect
game.”

Little can be said to argue

this point_when the 30-22 Pan—
ther victory over the No. 4
ranked Irish is brought into
retrospect. In fact, it would be
hard to find anybody to argue
the po_i_nt at all. - _,
' "This is certainly a bi.g'win
forthe program, to beat the
number fourteam in the coun-
try,” Pitt head coach ,Mike
‘Gottfried said with subdued
ecstasy. ”It’s a lot better being
4-2 than 3-3 at this point in the
season.”

”We scored 27 pointsin the
first half on a pretty good
defense,” he continued. ”You
have to give credit to the guys
like Craig Heyward, Louis Rid-
dick and the offensive line.
We came out in an un-
balanced line and it gave them
some problems. We told our
players we were going to do
this, but we never really prac-
ticed it all week, we just
walked through it. Even at the
hotel this morning.”

”I think I'm happiest about
the fact we went down on the
penalties and the mistakes this

'week.”

But Gottfried is not the only
person with the Panther team
who is happy about the win. .
His players were equally as
delirious.

”We’re sky high,” said quar-
terback Sal Genilla, whose sta-
tus was-unknown up and until
the first play of the game. Gott-

 

Bill Osborn heads for the endzone with Pitt's first touchdown after catching a pass from Sal Genilla in the first quarter.

fried confessed he had decid-
ed on putting Genilla into the
starting position again Wed-
nesday, but declined to tell the
press because of possible ef-
fects it might have had on the
passer, and the bad press
which might have surfaced be-
cause of Genilla’s recent mis-
fortunes. He commented ' he
was happy with his decision.
_ ‘fl just thought our best shot
in this ballgame was with Sal,”

Change of pace

’Sky hig’ Pantr upset t Dae,

he said. ”I felt he could han-

‘ dle the pressure better than the

younger quarterbacks. I'm
very happy for Sal — he just
hung in there all week.”

”-Maybe this will quiet down
some therpeople out there.”

And, in sync with his coach,
Genilla also was able to sing
his own praises for the first
time in weeks.

’’I wanted to prove to every-
body that I can do the job,” he

said. “Everything seemed to
work. The first -touchdown
pass did it. It gave me the con-
fidence I needed."

This certainly seemed evi-
dent. After a 17-yard kickoff
return by Michael Hadley, the
Panther offense appeared to
be doing the same as always
in running Craig -”lronhead”
Heyward for aparadigm of
plays. But after the first two
sets, something happened —

Soccer team
loses, 7-0, 
to 4th-ranked

Seton Hall

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team saw its
record fall to 3-5-1 after a 7-0 loss
to No. 4 ranked Seton Hall on
Saturday.

”We played them tough for
about 55 or 60 minutes,” said Pitt
head coach Joe Luxbacher.
”Then we just sort of fell apart.”

The Panthers fell behind early,
2-0, but the defense was able to
hold the Pirates off after that.
With about 15 minutes left, Seton

Hall made it 3-0, and never

looked back.
”We came apart at the end,”

said Luxbacher. ”We were able A

to hold them off for awhile, but
it kind of snowballed on us; We'll
just have to regroup thisweek in
practice.”

Pitt also had to overcome a few
injuries. Bryan Hammond was in-

-jured at the end of the Canisius

game. He tried to play this week,
but had to leave. Matt Segedy has
been hurt for the last few weeks,
and didn't make the trip. Scott
Armstrong twisted his ankle in
the second halfagainst Seton Hall
and had to leave the game.

”We were a little thin in the
back line, but still stayed with
them for awhile,” said Lux-
bachen

Pitt’s next game is Saturday af-
ternoon against Big East rival
Georgetown at Pitt Stadium.
Game time is 1:15.

”Georgetown is another tough
team,” said Luxbacher. ”They
beat us last year, and their coach
says they are improved this year.
Based on what we have done,
we're not. This week was an em-

lriSh’S Brown doesn't like Heisman talk. A

rare match—ups where each team
has a player with a shot at win-
ning the Heisman Trophy.

‘Craig ”|ronhead” Heyward,
still a darkhorse candidate for the
prize, rushed for 132 yards, giv-
ing him TOO or more yards in all
six games this season. For the sea-
son, Heyward has 780 yards
rushing with five games re-
maining. .

As for Notre Dame senior Tim
Brown, he entered the game as

bled twice, one of which was on
the tail end of a 39-yard pass
play.

Brown has not put up the major
figures you would expect for a
Heisman candidate, but his ver-
satility has made him an asset to
the team.

Brown tied the NCAA record
by returning two punts for touch-
downs against Michigan State.

He has been averaging 168.3
all-purpose yards-per-game so far
in 1987, which is eighth in the

nation, but his 226 total yards -

against Pitt should bring that
ranking higher. He now has 15
receptions for 328 yards in four
games.

Whether Tim Brown wins the
Heisman or not, he feels it really
won't matter. Brown seems to

with himself or the Heisman

’’I don't think about that junk.
I have to go out and help Notre
Dame,” said Brown.

Brown feels this loss has hurt
the Irish, but all they can do now
is to try and regroup.

”The team will look at the film
and try to come back. We have
to go ahead and play good ball.
This loss really hurts. A

”When you're number four in

 

the country, everyone comes at
you. We're Notre Dame —— every-

fully everyone else will do the

same.”

Although Notre Dame trailed
27—O at the half, Brown never
thought the Fighting Irish were

out of the game, and he knew he ‘
would play an important role in ‘

the second half.

”It [the comeback] wasn't that   
hard at all. We were down 27-0’,  
we had to come back. Down 27‘

points, we had the attitude ‘Hey,

we can come back,”' Brown said.

was only called for seven penal-
ties the whole game, and none in
really crucial situations which
had been the norm. Notre Dame
was flagged six times, but almost
everyone was big. ,

”Our penalties were absolute-
ly ridiculous and asinine. |’m anx-
ious to see the film,” said Holtz.

0 The Pitt offense may have
come up with the play of the year
— the old shovel pass. Last week
against BC, it was used well. This
week Heyward took it for a 23-
yard gain. The play is a simple lit-
tle offensive move where the QB
takes a few steps back, then push-
es the ball to a receiver. It fools
the defense almost every time,
and is hard to mess up.

0 Notre Dame came out with
a new quarterback in the second
half, Tony Rice. He is in the mold
of the new style of QB that seems
to be around — tall, fast and very
athletic.

”We expected it to be a little
easier with the backup quarter-
back in, but it wasn’t,” said Burt
Grossman. ”He completely
turned it around for them.”

0 This was a record—breaking
day for the team. lronhead
moved up to number four on the

all-time Pitt rushing list. He only ‘

needs 4,452 yards to move ahead
of Tony Dorsett and become No.
1. He also broke his own record
for carries with 42.

’’I don't keep track of_those
things,” said Heyward. ’’I just let
them fall as they may.”

Ezekial Gadson recorded his
19th sack of the season, breaking
Randy Hol|oway’s record set in
1976.
