Pitt News Announces w'73-'74 Editorial Stair‘ "r

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

As of Sunday, the Pitt News has
a new editorial staff. The new edi-
tor in chief is Sharon Sexton. a
junior, majoring in Mass Com-
munications; "the new business
manager is Barry Judd. a senior.
' majoring in Psychology.

Both of the editors would like
to see the Pitt News take more of
a stand on the issues and prob-
lems that face students at an ur-
ban university. Yet Sexton
stresses the need for more inves-
-tigative reporting and intends to
try out possible changes in the
paper before saying that they are
the policy of the paper. A I

Judd, a native of Squirrel Hill,
stated that “everybody seems to
enjoy working up here and I would
like to maintain that atmos-
phere.” He made clear, however,
his-major goal is making the pa-

per “run as efficiently as possi-g I

ble.” A‘

Sexton. agreeing with this need
for efficiency, believed that one
possible result would be the’“use
of the paper as an effective for-
um for student ideas." She ex-
plained that many students feel
"disenfranchised” by the Pitt
News, and therefore oneiof the
most "important tasks" before
the new editors is to "make “em-
phatically clear" the papers de-

‘ sire to "serve every student on

campus."

The newbusiness manager also
believes that the paper can be-
come a better forum for student

opinion through the “kinds of ad-

vertising we sollicit.“ Judd stat-
ed that “I _don’t like the idea of
censorship as long as something
is not clearly harmful to the stu-
dents."

,/\/lcCorduicl< Speaks on
 ‘Women and Words’

by LOIS ELDER

"Noteson Women and Words"
was the topic of ‘a colloquium Mon-
day, sponsored by the \Women‘s
Studies Program. Pam\ McCor-
duck. assistant professor of Eng-
lish at Pitt, was the speaker.

McCorduck said. "Women have
always been -associated. at least
in English. with words such as
scold. gossip, nag. and chatter-
box. Talkative men. however. are
alwayscalled just that,+talkative‘

_ men.

Women are now being taken
more seriously in the field of
writing than in any of the other
arts. according to McCorduck.

“The authoress Virginia Woolf

. . . said women write because the
material of ,the art, paper, is
cheap, and writing is an unobstru-
sive profession. Women can write
at home without, disturbing _ any-

      

‘ alized.

   

.. wr't' g .creates no 

gent need to set up a studio, as
painting does,” McCorduck ex-
plained. .

McCorduck sees herself. in the
role of a writer. as “a storyteller
and explicator of the real world
and imagination." She sees wom-
en writers "as currently being at
the point of creating new myths
and archtypes. ‘~‘I‘m glad to be in
on it." she said.

McCorduck said she does not
pattern her writing after any cer-
tain author. “I use no models for

vwriting. The situation is my own

and I must do as I see fit. which
is kind of scary s,ometi_mes."

Organizations to"

be Rerecognized P

"A majority of large organiza-
tions have refiled for recognition
in time for the reevaluation of
student organizations." Dave
W,ahl. chairman of the Commit-'
tee of "Student Organizations..has
reported.

"Assoon as recognition is fin-
room allocations. under
Union Manager Terri Melani can
begin. probably sometime around
the beginning of April." he said‘.

Wahl added that all organiza-
tions that have not met the March
9 deadline for filing will have to
reapply for recognition in the fall.
All those who have met the dead-
line will ‘be given priority con-
cerning room and funding alloca-
tions.

The primary reason for the

'“house cleaning‘ is to eliminate

the large number of student or-

' ganizations. and to merge organ-

izations that do essentially ‘the
samething, as in the case; 0f~’the
.Interfratern‘ity? Council and the;

He explained, however, that

the decision about the value of a t

given ad would be made by him
alone, but that the entire business
staff would try to be as objective
as possible in such decisions.

The new editors alsostressed
the implications of proposed new
composition machines that would‘
enable the Pitt News to do its own
preparation of copy. paste-up. and
preparation of “advertisements.
They both believe that the equip-
ment is economically feasible

Tito Aids’

Bar BQ restaurants . . . insur-
ance agencies . . . watch makers
. . . youth organizations. These are
just a" few of the listings found in
the Black Business Directory for
the Hill District. a publication
started by the Student Consultant

Project (SCP) to “develop minor- _

ity enterprise" in Pittsburgh.

The directory is one approach\
by SCP. a non-profit student or-
ganization associated with Pitt‘s
Graduate School of Business. to
‘provide management assistance
and growth opportunity’ for
“small. primarily black. ‘busi-
nesses." The program is directed‘
by William Tita. who is currently
working on his doctorate in busi-
ness administration.

Tita points out a number of
problems peculiar to the black

business community. He says _the I
- amount of business transacted be-

tween black firms and white buy-
ers is very small. The reason, he-
explains, is that most black busi-
nesses are either retail stores
or services located in‘ black resi-
dential areas -“which*whites don’t
go into.” In addition. to these lim-
itations, Tita says the manage-
ment of these small businesses is
frequently too inefficient for the
owner to compete for'buyers out-
side of his neighborhood.

To ov_ercome some of these ob-‘
stacles. SCP volunteers have or-
ganized themselves into teams
of consultants which :go ‘out and.’

 

 

“Riaclical Presence" Is 

Goal of New Group    

.by;DAVE MAJERNIK _ _

A dozen persons from the Uni-
versity. community, who labeled
themselves”i.‘radicals.“ gathered
for the third in a,series'of‘meet-
ings on Monday to discuss forming
an organization to meet their
common needs; A ‘

Some of those present proposed
that the parent group be divided
into smaller committees. each to
work on a specific project or re-
search work. These specialized
"circles,” they said. would com-
prise theloosely structured “um-
brella”\.organization.

Suggested projects for the com-
mittees were: discussing social-
ist, feminism, and researching
area health facilities to see how
they deal with-women.

Others proposed that the organ-
ization take on an educating role.
The University, they said. should

.be exposed to political issues

"now that the antiwar movement
is phasing out" and politically un-
conscious. students should be ‘
made aware of important issues.

{There ought to be a “radical pre-

sence" on campus. they said.
Another member of -the group

said she would like ‘to learn about

policies at.the University like the

- grading system and how Univer_- ’ ‘

sity money isspent, and perhaps‘. 
work to change these policies. ‘

A proposal "was made -toiset  

. a forum in which. speakers would.’ 

be invited to discuss issues for the‘;
political education in an”o'pen-_ 
meeting. Others said this sugges;-I , 
tion was too grandiose for this " ‘__
late in the term, andsuggested ,1 1;
that such a public forum could be 7 
planned for the summer or fall. 
terms. They said ‘a more modest: 
group discussion could ‘be plan-_ 
ned, based upon a specific topic, 
article, or book. Somesuggested. 
topics were “Work in America’, 
and the Class Structure” and? 
“What Happened to the Student 
Movement?” . ‘g 

One member sa_id he preferred: i_ 
the organization have a theoreti- 
cal basis so that its goal could''.}''
be clear—cut. But others disagreed’ 
saying that it would be better to , 
allow thetheoretical structure to v 
develop. ‘ 

The group decided to meet again? 1
on March 19' at 7:30 p.m. in 425.,

ods of marketing, accounting. and
financing. "The objective,” says
Tita. "is to enhance the pro-

prietor's growth potential.”

Tita maintains that through the
efforts of SCP, corporations. uni-
versities. and other contract ne-
gotiators have become ‘more

aware :of-, the black business com-. ,

then had the capacity to relocate

‘ to.an area which was accessible: .. ,~::.

to whites, thus doubly.'benefiting’f:'?§ i,';.'
from SCP’s assistance. 1 * vi?

 

The next step of the program,’ ' jé
says Tita, will be its institutional-l 
ization. During the first three"
years of its existence, “we got_ 
our hands dirty; we found out't.;éj;:-
where our ‘businesses are and’,i..\_f_.,),
where there is growth poten,tial.”~ _ i
What is needed now is a “lot.of.':~. 
careful thinking and planning.”

  

More research into the re-I 

sources whereby the program .. .~:..‘=-7.1

could be expanded is nowjneces-ji _
sary, says Tita. Currently, he is i "
teaching a course in the Graduate

School of Business called “The  

,-

Theory and Problems of Black
Business Development.”

According to Tita,‘ the work of 

_‘ the . Student Consultant Project-_., 

should be looked upon as "a social
program of the University, one
which is “capable of changing at-

‘:‘Dr.- Robert Perloff, director of

Business-and Psychology.

 Speaking before a group of about
20 students and faculty members,
Dr. Perloff described the Ameri-
can-_work ethic as a “hot issue”
because of the national interest
that the problems of the work
ethic has generated lately. He

‘Health, Education and :Welfare
and HEW Secretary Elliot Rich-
ardson.

The HEW study included a Task
Force set up to discover the ideals
and problems of the American
Work Ethic, and to explain the re-
cent change in the attitudes of the
American workers towards their
jobs. As Perloff pointed out, the
Task Force found that there was
a definite change in the attitudes
of many workers which mani-
fested itself in five different
ways: 1) the growth in the num-
ber of‘ communes; 2) the greater
emergence of panhandling; .3) the
increasing acceptance of the idea
of the four day work week; 4) the
increase in the number of welfare

recipients; and?5) the decrease in
productivity. ‘

Quoting from the book, Work in
America, Perloff -defined “work”
as “an act that produces some-
thing of value for somebody.” He
hesitated, however, about using
the term “work ethic,” which he
felt was perhaps too misleading
and restrictive a term. In its place
he suggested the term “living

iethic“ because he believes the
term “looks at man as a total per-
"son and that includes everything-
work and recreation.”

Another pointthat Perloff made
was that when most groups study
the American worker they “look

1 at the chief and not the indian.”
That is, instead of looking at the

production worker, the studies
have concentrated on members of
high and middle management
groups. According to Perloff,
“When we look at the worker,
rarely do we look at the work so
far as the worker is concerned.
They are trying to make manage-
ment better but maybe manage-
ment would be better if they un-
derstood the worker more.”

Furthermore, Perloff asked,
“When the American blue collar
worker is studied, why is it that
we have this thing about assembly
lines? Only two per cent of the
American labor force is on the
assembly line.”

Referring back to the HEW
Task Force, Perloff pointed out

that the group reached the deci-
sion that the restructuring of jobs,
the increased participation of
workers in decision making, and
the increase of interest of the
worker in his job were the heart,
and the central thesis of the study.

“It seems reasonable to me,”

said Perloff, “to want to make

jobs more interesting and fullfill-
ing.” But he also pointed out the
need for leadership if the Ameri-
can worker is going to seek
change for himself. “When people
see that there is an opportunity to
change, they will make a greater
effort to do so. It takes leadership
to show what life is like on'the
other side of the tracks.”

udcl,Announced Editors Elect

Sexton‘ also believes that the
_composition machines would
“enable us all to get a lot more
experience in the business of ac-
. tually putting\a paper out.” She
then pointed out that the new sys-
’tem “would make operating the
paper easier since it will give us
a chance to oversee the lay-out
of the paper and make ‘corrections
and innovations.”

The discussion of the_.new equip-
ment lead Judd to mention his

desire for more "interaction be-
tween the business office and the
editorial office—the better we
know-how the paper is run the
more smoothly it will run.”

Sexton, though concerned with
how smoothly the paper is run, is
more. interested in the quality
of the materials that it contains.
She believes, for example, that
the, paper must give much more
coverage to the “whole realm of
the theater and the cinema."

At the same time‘,-however, the
new editor in chief believes that
as a woman “there are certain is-
sues, like the role of woman on
campus” that she is both more in-

>volved with and more concerned

about “than a. male editor might
be‘?! 1

The T. Rev. Msgr. John M. Bi-
lock, vicar general of the Byzan-
tine Catholic Archdiocese in Pitts-
burgh has been named an auxi-
liary bishop for the archdiocese.

The appointment was announced
by Pope Paul VI at a consistory of
cardinals in Rome ’ on. Friday.
March 2.

In an exclusive interview with
the Pitt News, Bishop-designate
Bilock stated that he intends to
plan new innovations for thearch-

\ ’ diocese including establishment of

an organization for young people
and students. A ‘

The goals of this organization
would be “to bring students closer
to their faith and to develop lead-
ership abilities in them.” Biship-
elect Bilock stressed that this new
organization would help to get
students involved in community
affairs by working together with
various campus and community
groups.

When asked ifhe saw the possi-

”__bility of having a Byzantine Rite
" chaplain here’ at Pitt to serve the

needs of ‘the Byzantine Rite‘stu-
dents, Bilock said that the ap-
pointment of a chaplain to serve

all of the Pittsburgh area colleges _‘

is the most likely alternative. He
explained that a shortage of
priests makes having a chaplain.

‘ at each college almost impossible.

May 15 has been tentatively set
as the date for Msgr. Bilock to be
installed as auxiliary bishop. The
consecration will take place in

the Holy Spirit Church here in '

Oakland.

During the week of his installa-
tion. Bishop-elect Bilock plans to
have a cultural exhibition at the
Hotel Webster on the Byzantine
Rite. He hopes the exhibit will in-
crease people’s awareness of
the Byzantine Rite, Ruthenian
people and their culture. The ex-
hibition will be open to the Oak-
land community. '

The bishop-elect was to comment
on the liklihood of Archbishop Ko-
cisko being elevated to cardinal
in 1974 to coincide with the 50th
anniversary of the establishment
of the first Byzantine diocese in
the United States, Bilock said. he
"would not rule out the possibil-

City." ,

He added that when one consi-
ders that there is no Byzantine

Ruthenian Rite cardinal in the

world, and that the Byzantine dio-
cese in the U.S. are rapidly grow-
ing, the likelihood of a Byzantine
Rite cardinal in Pittsburgh is in-
deed very possible.

Msgr. Bilock also wants to ex-
plore the possibility of a Ruthen-
ian Nationality Room- in the Ca-
thedral of Learning. .

_petition characteristic of En-
gineers’ Week, '

by LARRY PANSINO

The 20th annual Engineers‘
Week festivities began Monday
afternoon with the Arrival Pa-
rade. which featured the appear-
ance of St. Patrick and floats rep-
resenting the various depart-
ments of the School of Engineer-
ing. ’ _

Saint Patrick. the patron saint
of engineers. made his yearly sur-
prise arrival by popping out of a
large artificial egg on wheels that
appeared at the start of the pa-
rade route at Forbes Ave._ and
Bigelow Blvd.

After appearing, St. Pat mount-

"ed the parade’s lead convertible,

which preceded the floats. He
was accompanied by the queen of
Engineers’ Week in the green
convertible. -

Following St. Pat was freshman
engineers’ entry in Thursdays

:Soap Box Derby. The car was car-

ried by its builders.

Next came a decorated telephone
pole repair truck. brightly trans-
formed with paper flowers and
ridden by several engineering stu-
dents clad in white sheets.

Then, the Civil Engineers’ float
crusied by, a pickup truck also
adorned with bright paper flowers
and followed by several unicyc-
ling engineering students.

By JOHN METCALFE

, The election season is upon us once again in
the City of Pittsburgh and the County of Alle-
gheny. Some of us have probably only recently
begun to recover from the strain of Presidential

' 1  and Congressional elections, and a new game has

V already started.

3 This is probably to the good, though. We are
not distracted from more important issues by such
trivialities as Richard Milhous Nixon and our
two Republican Senators (the Walrus and the
other one. Can he be a Carpenter?) or even the
great swarm of representatives this Sovereign
State sends off to Washington every two years.

Our.State Senators and Representatives are either.

in Harrisburg or being very quiet here at home.
The udders of the Commonwealth‘ are long; these
officials can be equally well nourished in either
case. ‘

 

When they are at home they are at least un-A

 able to legislate a greater flow or more frequent
= nursing. _

, Thus the field is clear, and local politics can
 take its rightful place as one of the finest, if not
" ﬁhighest, forms of entertainment available invpub-

lie.

 

Some of the offices at stake are clearly quite a

  important, and involve_ specific duties. The May-
 :"7‘_orality, for instance, would command respect even
if it were not so handy for sniping at the Zoo,
 the Conservatory, all of'City Council and certain
, ‘privately owned enterprises which imagine they
{are permitted to submit bids for City projects. City

'  Council I will pass for the moment.

School. Most are in the Party. though there are
a few daredevil Republicans. They will likely
at least win the primary.

There is a Republican candidate for Mayor.
He is really a Democrat who does not like
crowds. When the carnage of the Primary Elec-
tion has been cleared away, he will take on the
victor.

I have no idea how many candidates there are
altogether for all these various positions. The sim-
ple list of their names occupies an entire page of
the evening newspaper. and is a list only of names.
There are no sly allusions to the past exploits or
current conditions of most of the individuals list-

ed.

All this ‘is going on in a period when the pop-,
ulation of the_city is dwindling. and the county
is about stable. Such a great outpouring of poli-
tical ambition is a stirring testimony to a_ ground-
swell of interest in public service, as well as a
deep tribute to recent efforts to improve the pen-
sion status of public servants. It suggests a new
area in which economies could be practiced. V

‘Elections, even primary elections, are horren-
dously expensive \ts they are now conducted. Just
the trouble of getting all the names spelled right
on the ballots must cost/a pretty. In addition, all
political ‘parties hire persons to watch the polls,
always alert to. irregularities and chicanery on the
part of their political opponents. Coffee is some-
times served, and rides provided to some voters.
Persons generally believed to be reliable are en-
gaged to- count the votes. None of this comes
cheap.

A single law could solve the problem and save
the money, at least locally. ~'

The law would simply prohibit anyone who
is a candidate from voting. While this legislation

_ would deprive newspapers of one of their favorite

subjects‘ — the candidate voting early and often —
it would not materially alter the results of the

election. The privacy of the booth is sacred; how—'

ever,_ there‘ are only two possible outcomes when
a politician votes. I

If all politicians are vile creatures who would
indeed vote for themselves. the loss of one vote
by each would affect‘the result not at all. On the
other hand,,if all politicians are altruistic. and

scatter their votes among the opposition, statis- 

tical analysis suggests that the net effect could be
disregarded. ' r

A With this in mind. our course is clear.
Once all the candidates are removed from the rolls

'of eligible voters, it will be simple to identifythe

seven or eight enfranchised citizens who are left.

The candidates could concentrate their at-
tentions on this select group. Broadcast and news-
paper campaigning would no longer be neces-
sary. Posters would not deface the city. 4

On the appointed day, the eight electors (nine,
if Harry Blandig is back in town and isn’t running
for anything) could gather together and make their
choices. Coffee and rolls might be served, and the
press would be invited. They would announce their

if selections, congratulate the winners and wish the

losers luck for the future.
The whole thing could be over before noon.

and not a trolley institution. as

Rightist America

By LARRY PANSINO

Attempting to ascertain the sentiments and opinions of the Am-
erican public on a general range of social and political issues is al-
ways a tentative endeavor. Even the most professional polling agen-
cies asking specific questions of a "representative sample” of citizens
cannot determine with complete accuracy just what the views of all
Americans are. -

Therefore, any general conclusions made from individual obser-
vations with regard to something as emmense and diverse as Ameri-
ca must not be held to be universally or unalterably true.

It is with these qualifications that I wish to make some observa-.
tions on the directions of American opinion and leadership over the
past six_years and try to locate just where the medium of our ideolo-
gies lies today and where it may take us in the future. -

I need not contrast the objectives of the domestic programs of
the Johnson Administration with those_of President Nixon. The dif-
ferences grow from some of the most deeply held ethical beliefs of
the two men. President Johnson sought to construct his Great Society
around helping those who needed help. It is true that some of his
programs were wasteful or unproductive. but the goal of trying to
raise the poor out of their misery and eliminate economic suffering
in this land of abundance was always clear.

But President Nixon — leading exponent of self-determination
that he is——seeking_ to untangle much of the Washington bureaucracy
and shift the decision-making power over what Federal domestic
funds are used for _to local governments. The problem with such an

’ approach is the local politicians; it is most doubtful that much Fed-
eral money will not go where it is most needed but instead will be

alloted to improvement of areas which most serve those people who
are already financially comfortable——those that most influence poli-
-ticians.

F‘.

Accompanying this charge in‘ the uses of Federal moneys are
other more conservative stands on numerous social issues. About 708?,

. of the American people have registered their disapproval of court-

ordered busing of public school students to achieve racial integration.
The public and its representatives in state legislatures have express-
ed trends contrary to other high court decisions—specifically, the leg-
alization of abortion and the rejection of capital punishment (at
least as it had been applied). ,

These nationwide illiberal trends ,were graphically demon-
strated in the past two presidential elections‘. In 1968, about.%58% of
the electorate voted for either Richard Nixon or George Wallace.
And, of course, the President won reelection last November with an
overwhelming 61%. The “Silent Majority” is very real and has been
mobilized by the politics and policies of the 37th Chief Executive.

Unfortunately, such politics have tended to polarize many seg-
ments of the public. Members of these segments increasingly find
their interests to conflict with those of ‘other groups. In a broader
sense, members of ‘the “Silent Majority” —— people who tend to be
economically successful in life — are becoming less silent in their ef-
fect upon politicians. Because they do constitute a majority, thet
Nixon Administration has tried‘ to please them at the expense of less
advantaged Americans. »

These policies do little to help improve the sections of society
most needful of improvement. Questions of justice are reduced to,
politics by the President and his supporters——as reflected in last
weekend’s disclosure of Nixon’s stance of criminal justice. The Ad-
ministration seeks to punish the criminals and appease those citi-
zens who‘ demand retribution for crimes rather than confront the so-
cial conditions which engender much of this crime. Indeed, the Pre-

sident holds little stock in such sociological reasoning but regards ev-

ery man as the only controller of his own behavior.

’ Where such a situation will lead us is debateable, but I see lit-
tle reason to hope that social _i1ls——especially.the problems of the
cities—can be remedied under such policies. Ultimately, the blame for
continued poverty. inequity. crime’ and immoral leadership rests
with the people who elect the politicians that offer such ineffective
programs. Since politicians crave power, they will execute the dic-
tates of their constituencies as best they can in order to gain reelec-
tion. It is the selfishness of the American people—the idea that "If

I made it, why should I have to carry along someone too lazy to suc- __"

ceed‘_? ”—which has produced the governmental policies of today.

Only a more sympathetic, more intelligent populace can change
the tide of the times. '

To -fill you in on a little his-

,4  tory, Pitt was at one time refer-

‘red to as a “trolley college” be-
f. cause of the largely commuting
 nature of the student body, and

the students’ reliance on street-

 cars for this transportation. But
 to use a favorite adult phrase,
a  times have changed.

 rfWhile looking through some
"old issues of the Pitt News, I
 uncovered in the March 1, 1967

replacement that January 27 of
the remaining East End trolley
lines with buses. This “bustitu-

tion” affected seven routes, all of

which served Pitt.

You would think, because the
Pitt News is such a respected
campus authority, that this would
have finished off the University's
reputation as a trolley college.
Think again.

For some reason. unbeknownst
to me. Pitt remains attached to
the streetcar despite Pete Fla-
herty's low-quality asphalt cov-
ering the tracks on Forbes and
Fifth Avenues. Witness the
“Streetcar College" homecoming
float depicted just this last De-
cember in the Magic Bus.

Yet in an accompanying arti-
cle. one member. of the Bus’s
motley crew claimed they were
trying to rid Pitt of this label.
Egad. what contradiction!

Admittedly. though. these peo-
ple deserve. a little‘ credit for

.1 _ca_lling‘Pitt a streetcarfinstitution.- {-1 it

 

has been the case in other local
publications. Unfortunately, I’m
at a loss to cite these other offen-
ders, but well I remember them.

You see, the problem with us-
ing “trolley” is that you sound
like you’re from Philadelphia.
This is bad, because we call
them “streetcars” around this
town. It just ruins the effect of
a Pittsburgh school. Besides, no-
body wants to imitate Philadel-
phians -— they are the funny peo-
ple who say “soda” for ?‘pop”,.
and “wadda” for “water.”

Enough of this digression.

Pitt's streetcar image. even
when it is not given the specific
title. has survived in other ways.
The University Times, back in
September of_1971, ran an illus-
trated feature on streetcars. al-

though I‘ve failed to find the,

"trolley College" moniker any-
where in it.

This year's most recent Magic

at the American Legion Post -Five

was aifailure of the worst sort.
an-abomination that was barely
worth the time that it took to get
to. and one of the most disappoint-
ing and shocking experiences of
this reporter's life. '

At this point. however. several
should be made: I
am not a member of the Army or
the Air Force Reserve Officer
Training Corps (ROTC). nor do I
have any close friends involved
with the program. So these com-
ments come from an objective ob-

server who may very well have

missed the camaraderie and the
excitement of the occasion.

I do, on the other hand, ask the
reader to imagine a formal attire
gathering held on the second floor
of an American Legion Hall, while
there is a bingo game in process
on the first floor, and a policeman
guarding the door to make sure
that no “hippie, commie faggots”
sneak in to make trouble.

But, on the’ other hand. I ask
the reader to consider what it

and one’s own date.

One must certainly be shocked
by the last phrase—"bad food and

who could imagine an affair —

women have always been forced
todefer to men. thus even in lan-
guage women are secondary and
deferential when in doubt. Lan-
guage changes to meet society‘s
needs. “Arbitrary introductions

to the English vocabulary" are ‘

what make the living language and
what makes the revision of dic-
tionaries necessary.

Jeff McGee’s comment, that the
impact of the Women’s Rights
Amendment -“will be minor,” was
obviously ignorant of the facts and
sheer opinion. In the Feb. 19,
1973, issue of Time there is an ar-

ticle entitled “Trouble for ERA.”

It deals with the recent rising op-
position to this amendment. The
stop ERA movement is terrified
that “ERA would abolish many
legal safeguards that, in the. past
have established and protected
woman’s place in the home.” The
stop ERA movement has been
campaigning against the ratifica-
tion of the amendment and is
even pressuring those legislatures
who have voted yes to change
their votes. Kansas and Nebraska
are reconsidering their decisions.
Why all this scrambling if it's so
minor an issue? Jeff McGee ex-
hibits an attitude typical of the
traditional approach toward wom-
en workers. Arguments such as
his comment that “. . . many men

mouthing about equality. It took
an appeal to the Supreme Court
which deals with constitutional
matters. for women to win back
the right to control their own

get the respect of the feminists
and a real understanding of the
often-thankless role
they've held for centuries. Patern-

‘ maternity leaves). day care. and

an equal division of household
labor can give both men and wom-
en the satisfactions of homemak-
ing. child-rearing. andilabor out-
side the home.

It’s very informative to hear
that Jeff McGee thinks “men are
interesting because they have
traveled, met other people, or
have been educated.” I take it
that means that a male dishwash-
er, garbageman, or floorsweep-
er is inherently more interesting
than women doctors, writers, and
executives.

Also.~ name me the date and
place of one bra-burning. That‘s
one historical date I‘ve never been
able to pin down. As for the "high
visibility of lesbian members."
I'm sure there are lesbian fem-

can lesbians. This does not mean
that feminists are lesbians as
Jeff McGee tries to imply.

ihl(ibbufzim Members Discuss Collective Living

_NOTE: Joseph Shimron and Dr.
Reuben Chayouth will be two
of the panelists Wednesday
evening in the Kibbutz Sym-
poseum.

By STEVE LUBETSKY

Israelis Joseph Shimron and
Dr. Reuben Chayouth currently
are involved in affairs of the
University’s academic commun-
ity. But not long ago, while in
their native countrygboth gentle-

men lived in a much different .

environment.

Formerly members of kib_but-
zim (collective settlements). nei-
ther Shimron nor Chayouth admit
to problems in adjusting to Am-

‘ erican life. According to Shimron, I

he had only “the language dif-
ficulty, but this'i-s true for any-
one from a foreign country. I

was accepted almost everywhere."

For Dr. Chayouth, on the other
hand, a professor of Biochemistry,
althoughthe transition to Ameri-
can life was not problematic, he
admits to experiencing difficul-

_ties once he left his kibbutz for
the city. f‘My conflict between

the kubbutz and the outside world
was strongest during the first
year after I had left, and I criti-
cized many things about city
life. In the city, everyone is liv-
ing for himself, while life in the
kibbutz is living together with
others.”

Shimron, a candidate for a Phd.
in Psychology. finds similar dif-
ferences. Contrasting kibbutz life
with American society. he ex-
plained that a kibbutz is compris-
ed of “a group of people who
make a commitment to satisfy
each other’s optimal needs. It is

the commitment of the group

members to exert their best ef-
forts in their jobs and their feel-
ings for the community.”

. "The difference with American
socie_t_v'." he said. lies in “the

level of commitment. The Ameri- -
can government assumes a com-

mitment for members of the com-
munity,” he granted, “but it is
not ready to take;such responsi-
bility as does the kibbutz.“ Cit-
ing health care as an example,
Shimron asserted that hospitals
and doctors in the United States
service those who can afford" to
pay, which is "a commitment on
the basic level.” Kibbutzim, on
the other hand. furnish health
care “regardless "of the ability
to pay.”

Ideologically, the kibbutz
movement is characterized essen-
tially by three schools of thought
— right, center, and Ieft—but, ac-
cording to Shimron, in practice
these variations are not clearly

‘visible. The differences in ap- \
proach he described as degrees in
leftist

orientation, varying in
emphasis ‘on individual versus
group identity.

During the early 50‘s. howev-
er, these varying ideologies boil-
ed to the surface. creating ser-
ious splits within the various kib-
butzim throughout Israel. Ac-
cording to Chayouth. there was
a dispute concerning identifica-
tion of kibbutzim with Com-
munist ideas. for which the three
major movements -had different
solutions. “Mapam lthen the
largest movement) stated as its
ideal the realization of socialism
and actively identified with cer-
tain Communist principals.“

The center movement. Hamuch-
ed. Chayouth said. identified
with the realization of socialism
according to communism. but not
‘identification with communism
itself. I

The third movement. Ichod.‘

from where he comes. Chayouth
said was the most flexible ideo-
logically. -

In .all kibbutzim, this issue,
he said, created internal frag-
mentation. “People began to
hate others with whom they had
to share. Children and fathers
wouldn't talk to each other.”

Hamuchad. Chayouth related,
finally took the initiative in the
movement against the Soviet Un-

- ion as a result of increased dis-

crimination against Russian Jews.
Subsequently. the problem subsid-
ed, and now "the dependence on

“Communism is only ideological /

rather than practical.”

Whatever diversity there is in
kinds of kibbutzim is no less ap-
parent, and probablyimore exten-
sive. among members of these
collectives. which. according

of increased emphasis on the in-;;'

threats to the institution’s exist- 
ence. A

“Creation of institutions in it-
self is not enough. Kibbutz mem-
bers are not happy only with
achievement of quality, but are
seeking a better quality of social

interaction. Before 1948, it was
ideologically justifiable for kib-
butz members who attended uni-
versities to give up academic ca-
reers for agriculture,” because of
the need then for land develop-
ment, for which kibbutzim pro-
vided volunteers.

“The Kibbutz Movement is 667,75
years old, “asserted Chayouth,’ 

es in this time. But it is sti1l.rea-' 
lizing the same ideals as then,’ 
and has achieved prosperity”. ‘ ‘

. Despite the winds of progreS_.s*,‘
the decision to live in a kibbutz, 
nevertheless requires a.certain,“‘«
amount_of self-sacrifice. “To live’
in a kibbutz,” commented Shim-
. ron, “every person must make the 
commitment of his future to th_e,f-._.
rest of the group,” which, he ad,--~
mitted, was why he abandoned,
kibbutz living. “One must‘ b
ready to compromise his own 'de-'-
sires with the needs of the kib-3
butz.” _ _. 1 

But since the establishment of
the State, “the government today
can provide many services not
based only on voluntarism. ‘It is
now difficult to justify giving up
intellectual development.- for there
is no reason why a member
shouldn’t develop his talents to
the fullest."

 
   
    
 
 
  
   
  

Shimron acknowledged that kib-
butzim are not unaware of their
problems, and many are indeed
meeting demands for change,
“Members can now have occupa-

passing a point. or spending the
night in a stranger's bed.

The failure and incredible nai-
vete of the sixties is the framework
for Michael Weller's play. Moon-
children one of theTheatre de-
partment's major productions
this winter. Director Richard
Mennen has chosen a play which
is too bound up with the special
circumstances and mythology of
the past decade to be a great work.

But it is a brilliant statement of
history painfully recent enough to
touch and perhaps change us a
bit. The play is structured around
the growth and relationships be-'
tween seven' college students
living together during their last
year of school in a run-down
apartment complete with posters,
a wandering cat, a stash, and al-
most free love.

Mennen scarcely ever permits
us to break our sense of identifi-
cation with the actors although

their inability to deal sensitively.

with each other is embarrassing.
The witty dialogue is paced com-
fortably so one is enjoyably drawn
into the fray. at the same time re-
cognizing the real hostilities and
small cruelties that the actors ex-
change under the guise of hon-
esty and friendly fun.

The rock music which was the
code of truth of the children of
the fifties ties the scenes together
and becomes increasingly ironic
along with the tone of the play.
Niles Sayre‘s sound design sets
the opening tenderly with the
whistful plea from Tomm_v. "See
me. hear me. touch me. feel me.“
Later the Beatles “A Little Help
from my Friends" takes on an ab-
surd quality viewed in the light
of the irresponsible behavior of
the seven so—called friends.

Henry Heymann’s familiarly
shabby set split the audience in
half so they could see through
the playing area’ directly across
rpm the rest of the viewers, the
s allow depth subtly suggesting
the superficial fabric of the play-
ers’ philosophies and relations.

Thus the coordination of the
technical- business by Richard
Knowles and Mennen‘s direction
catch us in a bind. the same
W'ell_er_used in constructing the_

play. Just as the actors fabricate
lengthy stoned tales and raps to
"put-on" each other. we are put-
on b_y the entire production.

After all. they represent us.
the people we knew and perhaps
know. the way of life we lived.
The joke. however. is on us. be-
cause as much as we identify
with them. we see through them.
The intervention of time has
been just short enough to allow
us to feel close and just long en-
ough to allow us to be Cynics.
Mennen utilizes this critical dis-
tance tojinvolve us and force us
then to judge ourselves as we
judge them.

Our feelings toward the last
decade are so ambivalent, and we
are yet so much a part of it that
most plays about the period tend
to be full of very negative or very
positive stereotypes. Moonchi|-
dren rarely falls into that trap

and when it does, they’re not ter-

ribly untrue, just a bit exaggerat-
ed. This is the case with Ron
Sopyla’s Norman, an introverted
mathematics grad‘ student who gets
thrown "out of grade school" for
carrying a gun to his first demon-

people as we wanted to_believe.
As Mike says with a sneer. “Ev-
erything's cool now that everyone
trusts one another. right?" It
isn't that Mike and Cootie are
cold inhuman people either. They
simply use comedy routines as a
defense against caring too much.
Dick. the body beautiful of the
group. is self-centered enough not
to worry about getting involved.

David Zeigler is Dick. good-—

looking with a hard—surt'ace qual-
ity that makes him absolutely in-
violate to the needs of others.
except when it serves his own
purpose. Sharon Landes as Ruth
is the only one sensitive to the

cries of the others. She perceives

quietly that the power of youth
is illusory. that somehow the

world twists you into a _niche or

crushes you to bits. Knowing it
doesn‘t stop her suffering for
those she loves who the mythical
sixties have failed.

Layne Williams ‘Kathy’/tries
to hang onto her relationship
with her boyfriend Bob played by
Rich Johnston. She’s the kind
of woman, despite liberation, who
lives through her man. When re-
jected she turns to Dick to touch

— Bob, even if it’s a hurting touch.

Like a little girl intellectualizing
her dependence, Layne is soft
and selfish at the sameitime.

The cameo roles are all well-

cast with the actors who fill them

identities. The most easily accept-
ed is Frank Serrao as Mr. Wil-
lis the obese landlord. Most of
the steam for his sexual fantasies

are provided by his image of the

kids. and he gets his ego grati-
fication from visiting them. This
does not mean he will replace
the dangerous water heater in
their apart.ment. A guy-is gotta
make a livin’. ya know. 5

The actor who is the focus for
how all these people live and who
makes sense of the three-ring cir-
cus is Rich Johnston. Like the
Joni Mitchell song “Electricity”
he sees "the breakdown of the
century”. His pain has little to
do with the loss of Kathy or his
mother's death. or the fear of an

. army induction.

He understands that the sixties
are not what they‘re supposed to
be. When he asks. "Just what the
fuck are we doing here?“ he's say-
ing that Woodstock was four days
outlof a million. that Vietnam is
one war out of many. that no
matter how many marchers you
hold hands with. you still hold in-
side you the eternal loneliness of
humanlife.

What we find in Moonchildren
is that no power group co-opted
the movement. but that we have
failed ourselves and each other.
With the perspective of 1973.

Awe find sadly enough that the

funniest line in the play is Ser-
rao‘s. "You kids are the future
of this country."

Exliibition's Quality Declines

by DEAN SIEGAL

What is art? The making or do-
ing of things that have form and
beauty has long been accepted
as a definition for this abstract
concept. What makes one work of
art better than another liesin the
artists interpretation of what
beauty really is to him.

The Sixty-Third Annual Exhi-
bition of the Associated'Artists
of Pittsburgh. for the most part.
is not an agreement by concept
of beauty in art. For the most part.
it is a poor representation of the
artists living -here in Pittsburgh.
and last years‘ show displayed
many more artistic achievements.

I was especially surprised at
Mr. and Mrs. H. J. Heinz II’s con-
cept of beauty, when they award-
ed artist Troy West for his “sculp-
ture” called “Toot to be Pushed”
. . . . However, two awards were
superbly deserved and granted
to Raymond De Fazio for his
“Triptych: Late March, Early Ap-
ril” and Katherine Boykowycz
for her “Monstera Deliciosa.”

De Fazio. winner of the Rachel

'McMaster Hunt memorial award

shows three different views from
three wondows. and does so with
complete clarity of form. His use
of shadow and contrasts are exe-
cuted with a great amount ofcare
and talent. Miss Boykowycz. who

shows color and forms resemblant
to those of Matisse in her tapestry.

Last year's winner of the Katz
Foundation award was Harry
Scheuch. a native Pittsburgher.
who again displayed two fine oil
paintings with that same inherent
theme of solitude and calm. His
two works shown. entitled “Pitts-
burgh. Suburbia" and "Studio"
Wall" are fine representations of
his artistic talents.

One of the best parts of the ex-
hibit lies- outside the main room
in “Gallery K” of the museum.
It is a small room containing many
very interesting crafts such as jew-
elry, pottery, and fabric-work. The
jewelry by Alexander Speyer II
and John Fix is magnificent and
the silver, ivory, and stone work
must be seen to be appreciated.
The “Alphabet” tapestry of Helen
Worseny is a fine fabric tapestry.
Each ‘connected square holds an-
otherletter of the alphabet in a

creative and artistic way.

I have mentioned several ofthe
artists whom I feel have done out-
standing work that has not yet
been recognized or awarded.
Some of the awards for this show

went .to the wrong people. and)

one begins to question ,.the val-
idity of the jurors. . '

In the final analysis. the exhi-
bition as a whole was not equal
to that of last year. With the help

of the talented artists mentioned A

above. perhaps the Associated
Artists of Pittsburgh will improve
their show for 1974.

‘Dinner Thief’-Disappointing Fare)

By M. C. PILECKI

Often the “name" of a film
producer has great box office
appeal. regardless of the specifics
of the movie. It's usually a sound
bet that a "name” with a good
track record will produce a win-
ner. or at least finish in the mon-
ey. Because of this. it‘s especially
disappointing when his nag runs
dead last.

Such is the misfortune of Tan-
dem Productions. the people who
have liberated TV with All In The
Family, Maude and Sanford and

‘Son. Tandem partner Bud York-

in, assisted by some fine people
who “should have known better,
produced and directed the cur-
rent eelluloid mishmosh at the
King Court. The Thief Who Came
To Dinner. By the looks of this
film, he must dine at Winky’s.

The -story concerns a. computer
analyst who realizes the hypocrisy
of the world and decides to be-
come an “honest” jewel thief.
Right. Through blackmail, he

manages to‘ associate himself ~

with Houston’s wealthy elite, his
eventual victims. In the process
he obtains a mistress/cohort and
repeatedly foils the police and a
suspicious insurance investigator
as the “Chess Burglar.” ‘

The plot has more holes than
would fill Albert Hall. Take for
example the‘ one caper which has
our dashing thief stealing a 350

carat diamond from a well-forti-

fied museum. He wears no glov-

es (just a flimsy disguise), is pho-
tographed by surveillance camer-
as and is seen by no less than
four guards, one of whom scuf-
fles with him and shoots him in
the shoulder. Even though he
is already heavily suspected, the
police can’t scrape up enough

evidence for a warrant. Aw. c‘mon.

This thief bungles so much a K-9
dog could bring him in.

It‘s_hard to believe that screen-
writer Walter Hill, who wrote
the action-p_acked Getaway, ever
got involved in this thing.

As if the plot weren’t bad
enough, Ryan O’Neal portrays

thethief (it's impossible to la-‘

bel him the “hero”. In his grat-
ing performance, O’Neal gener-
ates no sympathy from the aud-
ience, who soon hopes this snotty
sonuvabitch will get his comeup-
pance. O’Neal’s idea of savoir
faire is boated smugness flair is
cheap flashiness and repartee is
slimy condescension. I

- His girlfriend is Jacqueline
Bisset, whose acting talent lies

solely in a pretty face (sorry
guys. no body shots). "

As the dogged insurance invest-
igator, Warren Oates is the real
protagonist, with his usual fine
performance. Unfortunately. with
this story—line and O’Neal’s snob-
bishness, the audience tends to
respond with pity.

Despite some isolated good ef-
forts from east and crew. The
Thief Who Came To Dinner in-

A spires mostly indigestion.

If the former flick is a “must
miss.” one film .that should be
seen (but probably will be miss-

ed) is Charles Chaplin’s Lime-

light, a 1952 release at the Shady-'

side. It is the sometimes-too-
sweet story of an aged, washed-
up comedian (Chaplin) and an
‘aspiring, though insecure, baller-
ina (Claire Bloom).

The film has less comedy than
early Chaplin, and is heavy on the
philosophizing. But it’s an enjoy-
able way to spend some time. and
it gives the audience some good
laughs, healthy optimism and a
few tears.

'Joe Testa. a defenseman last
season. converted to the center
spot this year and moved into
Bahnson's vacated position. Rich
Ba-ginski moved up to the second
line to take Williams’ place.

Pitt suffered more personnel
problems when first line right

’ wing Phil Clarke left the team im-

mediately after Myers and Carole

did. Fortunately, Phil Gefsky

moved in just in time to take

Clarke’s spot. Gefsky played on

the first line of last season’s

championship team but could not

work out regularly during the fall

term. Clarke has since rejoined

the squad, "returning to it more of-.

when they met C-MU as the skat-

ers battled the Tartans to "a 2-2
tie. C—MU went into the game
with the chance to put the wraps
on the City Division but ran into
some trouble a_ week before the
-contest. The Tartans lost a close
decision to. Indiana. giving Pitt
the possible two point advantage
of their final meeting.

C-MU had also shown inconsis-
tency earlier in thejseason, tying
both St. Vincents_ and Indiana». Af-
ter Pitt failed to clinch the divi-
sion with a win over C-MU. the
skaters faced the task of beating
ortying arch-rival Duquesne.

’ The game featured the rematch
of the rough style of the two
squads’ previous meetingfa game
that saw almost as many fights
as goals scored. After losing an
early 2-0 lead, Pitt put the con-
test away in the thirdperiod with

a pair of unaswered tallies. With
about three minutes left in the
game, a brawl erupted after Gary
Cummings was on his way"to the
penalty box after manhandling
the Dukes’ star C. H. Bender.
Referee Randy Chapman called

the game after the ice had been
cleared. fearing that another

ICE CHIPS: For his stick swing-

ing on Sunday night, Gary Cum-

mings will probably receive a

. suspension for the playoffs. Offi-

cial word will come shortly. Pitt
was without three regular de-
fensemen for the Duquesne game;
Kerry Browne sat out a one game
suspension after he had attacked
the referee in the C.-MU contest.

 

Glenn Hyde was out of town on
personal business and Greg Mintz
entered Presybterian Hospital
suddently over the weekend.

Browne will now have to post a
$25 bond, ‘insuring that he will
«not attempt to accost a referee
in the upcoming playoffs. Glenn
Hyde will be back for the St. Vin-
cents game but there has been no
word on the condition of Mintz.

C-MU has a game coming
against Penn State (McKeesport)
this week. If PSU can score two
goals or more, then Pitt will wind
up with the lowest goals against
average.’ Currently, Pitt has al-
lowed one more goal than the

Highlight Of Coaching Career

Bmtner. Mans Yanks I

by LYNN HARRIS

The head coach of the track pro-
gram here at the University. Jim
Banner, is a real winner.

The most recent evidence of

this is the selection of Banner as ‘

head coach of the U.S. m\en’s
squad which will compete against
the Russians on March 16 in Rich-
mond, Va.

A graduate of Cannonsburg_High
School Banner ran on the track
teams coached by ex-Pitt star
Dick Mason. After high school he
went into the Merchat Marines
for two years. The coach entered
Pitt in 1947 and was a varsity
quartermiler under Carl Olson for
two seasons. " ’ v

In 1950, he joined the._Marines
and ended up in Korea where he
earned a Silver Star‘ and the Pur-
ple Heart. Back in the States, he
refused a commission as a second

- lieutenant and returned to a coach-

ing position, high school‘ track
at Cannonsburg. ‘

At Canonsburg he compiled a
winning record of 69 wins against
11 losses and took his team to sec-
tion championships many times.
Banner remained at Canonsburg
from 1953 to'1961 when he was
named assistant track coach at
Pitt. .

In 1964. he was named interim
coach of cross country and led the
Panthers to an undefeated sea-
son. Banner dropped out of coach-
ing 1965 to teach and coordinate
at Tree’s Hall. .

In July of r1966 Banner was
named head coach of‘ the track
and field program at Pitt.

Posting a 50-19 record overall
this man. is indeed a winner. In

“.1972--, a1bne~»..h¢.‘ guided. th. e Pam

 

_thers to an undefeated indoor. sea-

son (6-0), cross country (2-0). and

a perfect outdoor record (1-0 ).

Presidentof the National '1‘.-rack
Coaches Association, Banner was
chosen by the AAU to direct U.S.
Olympians as well as outstanding
collegians in this second dual
meet between the two world pow-
ers.

Having no idea he.was being

considered for the job, Banner.

“couldn’t believe it.”
"It’s the greatestthing that has

ever happened to me,” comment-.

ed the happy Pitt coach.

“I'll be representing the -coun-
try. the University, and the ath-
letes as well as myself." he con-
ﬁnued.

The top collegians in the U.S.. « A.»

have been named to the team
whic include Pitt's Olympic al-

ternate and All-American Bill'

Rea. Rea ,placed third just this
past weekend in the NCAA indoor
track and field meet in Detroit.

Other top collegians named to
the team are Rodney Milburn.
high hurdle gold medalist; Ran-
dy Williams. Olympic long jump
winner and NCAA champion of
1973; and Barry McClure. an out-
standing triple jumper.

While these athletes have been
named to the team. the NCAA has
not sanctioned their participation
‘in themeet.

“They are very important peo-
ple and represent quite a few

The winner of the meet is the to-

“Coaching one division of the

Youth has certainly been the out-
standing feature on the '72-"73
Pitt basketball team. Young play-
ers such as Kirk Bruce and Tom
Richards were prominent figures
in the year’s confrontations.

Not least among the list of im-
pressive young cagers is a fresh"-
man Panther guard — Keith Starr.

As with other unseasoned play-
ers who advanced to the varsity
level—Bruce and Richards. for
example—Starr felt that at some
point. during the season he would

KEITH STARR, a 6-6, T85 pound freshman guard, was one of the
Panthers’ outstanding young talent on the Pitt basketball squad. Dis-
appointed with this season's team showing, he is looking for a ‘dyn-

amite’ year in ‘73.

get his chance to exhibit his abil-
ities on the court but was amazed
at the record time in which this
was accomplished.

“I thought I could play but I
didn’t think I would on a regular
basis,”— remarked Starr. “But I
didn’t think it would be so soon.”

Starr. however. quickly found
himself a berth on the varsity
squad and saw some action in 21
of the Panthers’ 26 games.

Possibly Starr’s most outstand-
ing performance of the season
came about in the second meeting

In that contest Starr seemed un-
usually sure of himself and al-
ways seemed to be at the right
place at the right time. The Pitt
eager collected a total of seven
points and came through in grand
style at the free throw line. Starr

made good. on three out of four’

attempts to gain for the Panthers
some very crucial points.

The reason for Starrfs impres-
sive showing against the PSU
Lions is two-fold—it was a combin-
ation of self-confidence and the
fact that Bruce had been ejected
from the game after he was
charged with committing a flag-
rant foul that injured the Lions
Ron Brown‘.

“It was both — because Kirk
was out I new I had-to produce
and also it was because I felt con-
fident in myself.“ related Starr. ‘

As far as next season is con-
cerned the Sewickley, Pa. native
would like to see even more ac-
tion than he did this year. The
one area that Starr feels he must
improve on is his shooting. The
freshman only averaged 3.8 points
per game and would like to see
this figure up around the 11 mark
along with a possible six assists
per game average.

There is one thing that Starr
does not want to change and that
is his position. At 6-6, 185 pounds

Starr-Bright Spot In Cats’ Future

Starr enjoys playingguard and
has no desire to switch to a for-
ward position.

"I like it right were I'm at.
I like to handle the ball." stated
the young Panther hoopster.

Reflecting on the outcome of
the season, Starr feels that the
Panthers were a much better
team than the 12-14 record indi-

‘ cates.

"We had a better team than
showed. We played some tough
teams and often lost by only one
point." said Starr.

“The Notre Dame game was our
best game.“ he continued. "We're
a young team. ‘though. and when
we got into tight situations like
the one at Notre Dame we just
messed up."

There to help the Panthers along
in just such struggling moments
this season was cheerleader ‘Tig-
er’ Paul Auslander.

Starr believes that Tiger was

one of the best things to come -‘

along during the season. “Tigers A 
great. Sometimes the fans wouldn’t , 2’

be with us and then Tiger would
get up.“ commented the cager. .\

With the return of essentially: is

iors were lost this year) that now’ .

  NIT Pickings

(Continued from Page 12)

" . Somewhere in the country there is a team that deserved
5to go to the NIT more than the Irish did. Undoubtedly, there
farea whole lot of teams that deserved the shot more. The
j-‘_ Irish had to go into overtime to defeat the Pitt Panthers (12-
5—I4) and they were soundly defeated by the Duquesne Dukes
 (16-8)", ‘one of the teams that deserved the bid before the

South Benders. But, they beat Marquette by one point and that

intakes them ‘giant killers’.

_ You couldn‘t expect the Irish to refuse the bid. In fact.

,they hold over the world of sports. What other team can you

NEW YORK (AP) — Minnesota
and North Carolina were estab-
lished Monday as clearcut favor-
ites in a strong National Invita-
tion Tournament field.

But several other college bas-
ketball teams, although taking a
back seat. warned that they were-
n‘t coming to New York this week
just for the fun of it.

The positions of the entrants in
the 16-team field were well de-

l fined at a drum-beating luncheon

for the nation's oldest post—sea-
son basketball tournament, sched-
uled for Saturday, March 117.
through Sunday, March 25.

‘-‘It’s an outstanding field-—the
strongest in my memory,” said
Dick Phelps, the coach of Notre
Dame. “Of course, North Caro-
lina and Minnesota should be fav-
ored—but there might be some
major upsets in the first round.”

The meaning was clear that
Phelps had intentions of sticking
around past the first round when
his team meets Southern Califor-
ma.

The Fighting Irish appropriate-
ly play the opener of this week-
long affair on Saturday. which is
St. Patrick's Day.

“We’ll be wearing green sneak-
ers and carrying shamrocks —
anything to win,” Phelps said,
grinning. '
