President Barack Obama asked

. voters for another four years to ﬁx

the economy. Last night, America
granted Obama his wish by giving
him a second term in the White
House.

Obama was re—elected last
night, having won 290 electoral
votes as of 12:20 a.m. Wednesday.
This will be the ﬁrst time an Afri-
can-American president resides in
the White House for two consecu-
tive terms. V

The president’s ofﬁcial Twit-
ter account immediately posted a
message to supporters. “This hap-
pened because of you. Thank you.”

But Obama’s victory was no sure
bet for much of the night.

After polls started closing at 7
p.m., Mitt Romney, -the former gov-
ernor of Massachusetts, seemed to
be taking the lead with most of the
southeastern and central states.
He conquered big states, such as
Arizona and Texas, giving him
more electoral Votes than Obama

But Obama came back by win-
ning most of the northeastern
states, including Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachu-

many other surrounding states.

a The tide started to turn in
Obama’s favor when the presi-
dent not only won his home state

of Illinois, butalso Republican H

Furthermore, Obamagsnatchedp
Massachusetts away from Rom-

formerly governor.

Even though Romney stopped
in Moon Township, Pa., yesterday,
Obama still won the electoral votes
for the Keystone State.

The election turned blue for
good when Obama surpassed 200
electoral votes by winning Califor-

Students flock to the polls on Election Day

Poll workers at campuspolling [ocntionsns/e

students to ﬁll ontprovisionol ballots

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

While some students encountered long lines V

at the polls, others were unable to cast an
ofﬁcial vote.

Poll workers asked more than 100 stu-
dents to cast provisional ballots, or ballots
that are not counted with the popular vote
on Election Day, at voting locations on cam-
pus. Poll workers can ask a voter to fill out
a provisional ballot if the voter isn’t on the
list of registered voters at a polling place,
if the voter doesn’t have required ID or if a
voter’s registration is questionable for any
other reason. Within seven to 10 days after
the polls close, election officials will go over
each provisional ballot to determine if the
ballot is legal and should ofﬁcially count.

Anne Morrice, a campus organizer for
Pittsburgh United, an activist group that
advocates for social and economic justice,
monitored voting locations‘ across campus
for any issues students faced in casting their
ballot. '

By 2 p.m., Morrice noticed asigniﬁcant
problem for a number of students trying to
vote in the William Pitt Union and Soldiers
& Sailors Memorial Hall. She had recorded
that poll workers asked several dozen stu-

dents to cast provisional ballots at these

two locations because their names were not
in the book of expected voters for the site.
According to Morrice, many of the voters

' asked to cast provisional ballots claimed that

they had registered to vote from their Pitt
addresses before the registration deadline,
but that upon arrival at the polls, they were
told their names were not in the book of vot-
ers registered for the William Pitt Union and

Soldiers 8: Sailors polling locations.

Senior Rich White, a poll monitor for
PennPirg, another voter advocacy group,
reported that he witnessed problems related
to provisional votes in Posvar Hall as well.

Poll workers released thetotal number of
provisional voters after the polls closed at

8 p.m. Eighty provisional ballots were cast .

in the Union, 31 at Soldiers 8: Sailors and 25
for Posvar Hall.

“I’m really frustrated,” Morrice said. “I
had a girl coming out of [voting in the Union]

crying because she was a ﬁrst—time voter, and

they asked her to cast a provisional ballot.”-
Freshman Victoria Meglio was one stu-
dent who was asked to cast a provisional
ballot while voting in the Union. .
Meglio, a resident of Holland Hall, said.
she applied for a change of address the last
week before the voter registration dead-

"line but never received conﬁrmation for

this change. When she arrived to vote at the
Union,‘Meglio said poll workers informed
her that her name was not in the books and
that she couldonly voteprovisionally.

“It’s an American right to vote, so it’s kind
of a bummer,” Meglio said. V V

Morrice said sheobserved at least one
case in which a student’s lregistrationseard

‘ indicated that thestudent shouldivote at the
Union, but the student’s-name was not in the A

Union book, and the student was asked to

"cast a provisional ballot. " 1

Workers for Pittsburgh United encour-
aged those who cast a provisional ballot to
ﬁll out a form outlining the reason they were
asked to cast a provisional ballot and told
them to call nonpartisan coalition Election
Protection to document their provisional
ballot.

Voting goes smoot/71)/for students at most on-

cnmpns voting locations

The Pitt News Staff

Although an early-afternoon technologi-
cal blip at the William Pitt Union caused a
few voters stress on Election Day, voting
at polling locations across campus seemed
otherwise to go smoothly.

_ Students casting their ballots Tuesday in
the 2012 presidential and local elections ex-
perienced medium-sized lines to the voting
booths. But although temporary back-ups
occasionally interfered with class schedules,
the Election Day procedures didn’t run into
many issues —— the only reported exception
being a quickly resolved technical difﬁculty
at the Union.

At Posvar Hall, students endured hour-
long waits to vote in the morning, before
poll workers expedited the process by divid-
ing voters into two lines. Students who cast
their votes at Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial
Hall similarly withstood 40 minute‘ waits
in line aroundl p.m., disrupting their class
schedules. , M

“It was hard to schedule class-wise. Now
I’m late,” freshman accounting major Dave
Barr said. - ,

_ The polling lines snaked through the Ball-
room on the Union’s ground ﬂoor, and stu-

 dents grimaced when volunteers announced

machine malfunctions around 12:45 p.m.
. _ According to a polling place volunteer,

— all 18 machines inthe Ballroom shut down
_ just before 1 p.m., several with Personal

Electronic Ballots —1 the technology used
to vote electronically — up on the screen.
On the machines that were in use, the last
votes froze so that the next students could
not cast their ballots.

The problem was resolved withins min-

I 5 utes of its arising, however, as volunteers
rushed to replace the PEBs and restart all

   

of the ballots. Volunteers assured students
who had already voted that the process was
back to running smoothly and that their
votes would be counted. ;

Despite some inconvenient waits and the
minor delay at the Union, students seemed
to be satisﬁed with Tuesday’s polling pro-
cedures.

“I liked that they made it idiot—proof.
There was always someone there instruct-

ing you what to do,” said Barr, who voted at

Soldiers 8: Sailors.

First—time voters agreed. -

“I’m not really worried about not know-
ing what to do,” freshman Kaitlyn Saylor
said. “It seems like an organized process.”

Around 7:30 p.m., as the polls neared
their 8 p.m. closing time, a slew of Obama
supporters marched down Forbes Avenue
holding pro—Obama signs and calling out
slogans. 4

Although the streets were loud, the Pitts-
burgh Bureau of Fire on McKee Place was
mostly quiet and practically empty by that
time, with the exception of poll workers and
a couple of voters.

‘ According to Lauren Branson; a Pitt Law
student and poll worker atthe Pittsburgh Bu-
reau of Fire, the state still told poll workers
to ask voters for identiﬁcation, even though
Pennsylvania’s voter ID law was halted by
the state’s supreme court. Branson said
that identiﬁcation has “not been a prob-
lem” this year and that “almost every voter
has showed” identiﬁcation, although they
weren’t required to do so.

After voting for the ﬁrst time, some stu-

_ dents felt as if they had matured in some way.

“It was my ﬁrst time voting,” said Brit-
tany Robinson, a junior sociology major who
voted at Soldiers & Sailors. “I feel good. I feel
like an adult.” I

Voting at the William Pitt Union might have
slowed around 5 p.m. yesterday, but the
atmosphere of electoral enthusiasm didn’t
waver. ‘

City Councilman Bill Peduto visited the '

Union’s Tansky Lounge late Tuesday af-
ternoon, bringing along pizza anda few
performers to keep late-wave student voters
in the Election Day spirit.

The Democratic mayoral-candidate ar-
rived at the Union around 4:45 p.m. with
two musicians from local bands accompa-
nying him in his effort to encourage stu-
dents to come to the polls.

Peduto said he didn’t want students to
get fed up with the lines, _so he brought them
pizza and music to help with the wait. The
councilman espoused the merits of voting
as he talked one—on—one with students dur-
ing the event.

“The only time you see the overwhelm-
ing power of students voting.is during
presidential elections,” Peduto said, not-
ing that Ward 8, District 4 — the area that
includes the Litchﬁeld Towers — repre-
sents an extremely dense concentration

of potential voters. He said that during
the 2008 presidential election, voters in
the district turned out in,numbers’- higher
than expected.

Around 5:15 p.m., Mike Waalkes, the
Pitt Democrats’ media and public relations
ofﬁcer, said that he had witnessed around
60 voters come through the lobby within
the 20 minutes he had been in the lounge.
While students arriving to vote at the Union
between 4:45 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. did not
encounter the same winding lines from

, earlier in the day, they represented a later

wave of the 1,974 Voters who cast their bal-

‘ lots at the Union Tuesday.

Musicians Josh Verbanets and Greg
Dutton of local bands A Meeting of Im-
portant People and Lohio, respectively,

also performed individuallywhile Peduto_
_ was present.

Verbanets, who graduated from Pitt in
2006 with a degree in finance, said that he
and Dutton came to perform because they
are friends of Peduto. _

The councilman, who left the Union af-
ter about an hour, emphasized that he was
not there to campaign, but to encourage
students to vote. I

Senate

Despite facing a challenger who greatly
outspent him in the months leading up to the
election, incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob
Casey was re-elected Tuesday night, accord-
ing to an Associated Press report.

As of 10:15 p.m., Casey led Republican Tom
Smith 58 to 48 percent with 60 percent of pre-

cincts reporting. Smith conceded the election ~

to Casey just minutes later.

Smith, an Armstrong County coal—mine
owner, spent $17 million of his own money
on the race in addition to over $2 million in
outside_ spending, greatly surpassing Casey,
who pulled in $90_o,0o0. But it wasn’t enough
to overcome the socially conservative Casey,
who held a wide lead until late in the summer,
when Smithsurged in the polls.

Gordon Louderback and Natalie Rothen-
berger both agreed that the Student Gov-
ernment Board president must represent
students, but the two Board members held
different opinions on the degree to which
the Board should pressure the administra-
tion and assume public stances.

The two" Student Government Board
presidential candidates addressed these
issues, among others, in a debate forum

Tuesday night before about 40 people gath- -

ered in Nordy’s Place of the William Pitt
Union. The debate was hosted by SGB and
co-moderated by SGB Elections Committee
Chairwoman Annie Brown, WPTS News Di-
rector Tom Visco, and Pitt Political Review
Senior Editor Alex Zimmerman.

Over the course of the hour-long debate,
the candidates discussed the University’s
transgender policy, the Collegiate Reader-
ship Program, differing leadership styles,
project feasibility, the Student Activities
Fee overhead fund, allocating processes
and the SGB election process. Each candi-
date was granted two minutes to answer
each question, with a minute for follow—up.

Students can vote for the SGB president
and ﬁve Board members during the SGB
election on,,Nov. 17.

November 7, 2012 1 The Pitt News l vvvvw.pitihevvs.comg

  SGB presidential candidates face off on issues in debate

Is the University’s current transgen-
der policy appropriate? And is it SGB’s
responsibility to pressure the admin-
istration if its views are not in line with
students’?

Louderback said-that while he admits
that he is not fully informed on transgender
issues, the University takes the right steps
in assessing issues and dealing with them.

“[Transgender issues] are not some-
thing SGB should be able to decide on, or
have a public opinion on, as a whole,” he
said, adding that he would not share his
personal opinion, but that he trusts the
University’s way of approaching issues.

Rothenberger disagreed, saying that the
transgender issue became a student issue
and praised" current Board member Julie
Hallinan for assisting concerned students
affected by the policy. She added that SGB
members continually take public stances
through approved referendums.

“SGB as an organization can’t always
effectively change [Univer.sity]'policy,” she
said. “But we must make sure we are there
for students in terms of assistance.”

Louderback countered that the Board
should provide all the means to represent
a student and to ﬁght for students across
campus, but argued that it is not SGB’s role
to release a public opinion.

Collegiate Readership Program:
Would you continue to support the pro-
gram as president?

Louderback said that while students
should have the ability to read the paper of
their choice, the Student Activities Fee is
for activities and not meant to supplement
student learning. He said that he voted in
support of the contract renewal at Mon-
day’s meeting, because if the program was

. not approved, that it would not be “realis—

tic” to invite the program back.

Louderback said that as president, he _

would make it a point within his ﬁrst six
months to ﬁnd alternative funding for the
program.

“I feel obligated to ﬁnd a permanent
home for this, one not under SGB, and

students can still get their newspapers,” a

he said.

Rothenberger said that as president,
she would create a committee to hold
regular meetings about the program and
do more than holding planning sessions
once a month at which the program may
be mentioned.

“We, as a Board, did not work enough
on this project,” she said, before suggest-
ing that SGB should approach groups such
as the University Honors College to aid in
funding the program and reminding stu-
dents that the Board does not pay for those

papers that are not picked up.

“I think reading is an activity,” she said. '
“If no other source can be found, then
[SGB] is a feasible resource [for funding] .”

Allocations and budgeting: Would you
support making budget deliberations
public?

Rothenberger said she is not sure that
budgets would be of interest to students,
but that each budgeting is personal to the
requesting organization. ‘

“[Requesting is] nerve-racking,” she
said. “It’s important that organizations
have that one-on—one time to sit down and
explain what they are requesting for.”

Rothenberger said that publicly an-
nouncing the amounts funded may be
“more confusing and abrupt tostudents”
and that students may be permitted to see ’
the numbers dealt with in budgets.

Louderback said that while he agrees

V with Rothenberger that going “line item

by line item would be ridiculous” in public
meeting, the bottom-line approval should
be shared with the public. He added that he
feels that Student Affairs-affiliated groups
should be given the option to submit sup-
plementals along with their yearly budgets.

He said that‘ while budgets might deal

with big numbers, anyone could run the
numbers themselves, and because it is the
Student Activities Fee, it should be made
public to students.

“It could be as simple as reading off the
bottom lines at the following public meet-
ing,” he said.

Rothenberger criticized Louderback’s
argument and said that he was “missing an
important factor” and the situation must
be comfortable for all involved.

The rollover and overhead: Would you
consider making changes to the Alloca-
tions Manual to handle unused Student
Activities Fee funds, reduce the Student
Activities Fee or readjust funding caps?

Louderback said that the overhead is

not merely “sitting in a fund that is just _

accessible to [SGB],” but that it serves a
necessary function.

. Rothenberger said the overhead is a
“mystery fund” and-, as president, she
would work to educate SGB members about
it. Shewsaid it’s important to continue ana-
lyzing the Allocations Manual, but that
the Board needs to transition to a “more
working budget,” relying less on the sur-
plus funds. '

.Unfeasible projects: How’ do you plan
to help Board members reinvent projects
and circumvent dead ends?

November 7, 2012 I The Pitt News { wvvvv.pittnevve.com

Louderback cited his green roofs initia-
tive that hit a dead end and described how
he reworked it into a focus on ensuring the
Green Fund Advisory Board as a permanent
ﬁxture in Student Affairs.

“You may hit a wall, but use it to your
advantage,” he said. '

Rothenberger said she quickly learned
her safe-walker program initiative was not
feasible, but believes it’s important to keep
trying and work to eliminate the learning
curve that new‘Boards face by creating a
smoother transition period.

“It’s important to remember that proj-
ects in SGB take longer than a semester,”
she said. “I’m'a ﬁrm believer that if for some
reason you hit a wall, help other Board
members with their projects and continue
to listen to the students and what they think
is important oncampus.”

Allocations decisions: Should they be
governed by precedent? ’ ‘

' Rothenberger said that precedence is
important to create a “ballpark ﬁgure for
funding,” and said that she is a “strong
proponent that, depending on the situa-
tions, exceptions can be made.” She said
that in terms of spring break, exceptions
can be made for group funding as long as
they are of a “necessity.”

Louderback agreed that precedents are
important in terms of checks and balances
and gauging funding.

_“Spring break wasn’t funded as to not
compete with alternative spring break or

RECIE 10% or:   WITH

fund a group’s personal vacation,” he said.
“But I agree that we need to look at this by
a case—by-base basis.”

SGB election process: Is the current
slate system ideal?

Rothenberger said she voted against the
referendum that would allow students to
vote for all nine members of the Board to
avoid the-creation of “super sister slates”
and that it is important to have diversity
on the Board.

“At the end of the day, when you are
looking to run, it’s difficult to know all on
campus who are interested in running,” she
said. “It’s important to have people who
bring new ideas to the table.”

Louderback said that he also voted down
the referendum to vote for eight Board
members and a president because the
Board “needs to be represented by people
who are not on slates, as well.” He said that
voting for ﬁve members allows for three
spots to create diversity on the Board.

SGB election process: Does the cur-
rent system marginalize independent
candidates?

Rothenberger said that, as president,
she will work to stop marginalization that
may occur each year and work to get more
students involved.

“[SGB is] kind of still a bit of an insiders
c1ub,” she said.

Louderback said that running indepen-
dently “can be done, and can be done well,”

but said that one of his initiatives is meant
to get more students involved with projects
and grant them access to SGB resources to
create successful projects.

For Natalie: You have an initiative to
set up regular meetings with commit-
tees and Board members. Why was this
not addressed during your tenure as a
Board member? How would you address
resistant Board members?

Rothenberger said that some current
Board members are averse to “tons and
tons” of meetings, and that she believes
that “committees are the least-utilized
members of SGB.”

She said that by the time that members
are elected, they will work together as a
team and setting aside meeting times from
the beginning will produce a more effec-
tive Board.

‘ For Gordon: When you were putting
your slate and sister slate together, did
you conduct an assessment of project
feasibility?

Louderback said that he would notfeel
comfortable endorsing candidates with
unfeasible projects and that he ensured
that candidates were passionate about their
initiatives and could accomplish them.

“It is very important to not just throw
up projects,” he said. “Even if it does sound
good to the student body, if the project is
not doable, that is wrong.” I

ELECTION A

Maggi, a Washington County commis-
sioner, couldn’t overcome the experienced
Murphy, who has held his seat since.2003.
Overall, the campaign between the two men
was rather tame, featuring small contentions
over President Barack Obama’s Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act.

State Attorney General

Former District Attorney Kathleen Kane
won the election to become the ﬁrst Democrat
and woman elected to the position in Penn-
sylvania. A

Prior to 1990, the position of attorney gen-
eral was an appointed position, rather than an
independent political ofﬁce.

Throughout her campaign, Kane constantly
referred to herself as “a prosecutor, not a poli-
tician.” Her opponent, David Freed, touted his

experience as a former Cumberland County
district attorney, as well as his endorsement
by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a former
state attorney general.

State Treasurer

Democrat Rob McCord won re—election
Tuesday evening, defeating Washington
County Commissioner Diana Irey—Vaughan.
He will be responsible for managing govern-
ment investment and keeping track of budget
surpluses and deﬁcits.

State Auditor General

Democratic State Representative Eugene
DePasquale, R-Manchester Township, won

‘ the position of state auditor general Tuesday

evening. .

Depasquale, who has been aﬁerce advocate
of including Pennsylvania’s state-related uni-
versities — including Pitt — under the state’s
Right to Know Law, defeated State Rep. John

well, with Ryan and Romney making stops
in the state the week before and even the
day of the election. Former President Bill
Clinton stumped for Obama the day before
the election in Pennsylvania, which held 20
electoral votes.

The narrow race featured a sharply di-
vided country. Obama’s campaign, which was
expensive and at times bitter, strayed away
from the 2008 theme of hope and change.
The election included more than $2 billion
spent in campaigning and unprecendented
hours of TV ads. ‘

At about 11:15 p.m., when media outlets
began to declare Obama’s second term, cries
of “four more years” and hoots of elation be-
gan to erupt from Organizing for America’s
Oakland office. A crowd of about 40 people
from the office began to ﬁll the nearby inter-

— section of Forbes Avenue and Atwood Street.

Sarah Procario, a junior political science

major who worked for the Obama campaign

as a fellow up until Election Day, was among._

those awaiting the results at the ofﬁce.
Looking back on the long Election Day,
which Procario said began at 5 a.m., she felt
pleased with the campaign’s efforts.
“We were expecting to have to push the

youth to go vote, but there was actually a
really strong turnout,” she said. ‘ -

About 100 Obama supporters took to the
Oakland streets in celebration, holding signs
and cheering as they made their way down
Forbes Avenue on foot. Car horns blared
through the night in unity with celebrators’
messages. A

Eliza Kaye, a freshman who is undecided
about her major, participated in the street
celebration. 7

Before Kaye descended to the street after
the announcement of Obama’s second term,
she had been watching the state tallies from
her room in Towers. She said that she was
“relieved” about Obama’s re—election.

“It was the ﬁrst election I got to vote in,
so I feel like I did my part and played my
role in something that made a difference,”
Kaye said. ‘

Chris Bonneau, an associate professor
of political science at Pitt, said he was not
surprised by these election results.

“This is exactly what I was expecting,”
Bonneau said.

Looking toward the future of our country,
Bonneau said he believes Obama will try
to advance his jobs program and decrease
unemployment. -

Despite Obama being projected to win
the election, Romney still had not conceded
the election as of 12:20 a.m. Wednesday. The
state of Ohio was still ‘tied at this time, and
its electoral votes were key to the Republi-
can party in this election, as no Republican
candidate has won the election without the
support of Ohio. _

However, Republicans did, in fact, win
in terms of keeping control of the House
of Representatives. On the other side of

Congress, the Democrats predictably kept -

control of the Senate. I

GOING MENTAL

To meet increasing demand, Counseling
Center needs more resources

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

The good news is,.Pitt students
do want to Talk About It.

The bad news is, we don’t have
enough staff to listen to them all.

The Talk About It program’s
goal, according to group presi-
dent Michael Deckebach, is
not to advertise the University
Counseling Center’s services,
but to emphasize “prevention
and stigma reduction.” However,
Deckebach has been approached
on multiple occasions — such
as while tabling for Talk bout

mental health troubles, and his
response is always to refer them
to the Counseling Center.

The fact is, the efforts of the
Talk About It program have re-
sulted in students seeking help
who weren’t seeking help before,
and that’s awesome — except
that the resources allotted to ac-
tually helping them haven’t kept
pace with the outreach effort. As
student demand for counseling
services has exploded, the Coun-
seling Center has struggled to ac-
commodate the increased need,

According to Tevya Zukor,

the 2,000 students not being seen for on-
going treatment either have short—term
problems or have been able to meet their
needs elsewhere — but I’m not convinced.

The counseling center currently staffs
six psychologists for counseling services,
plus two licensed psychologists who di-
rect the program. If you add two psychia-
trists, two post-doctorates and four pre-
doctoral interns, you have a counseling
staff consisting of 16 people. Meanwhile,
the University of Pittsburgh is home to a
total of 26,350 students. It is impossible
for a staff of 16 people, including interns,
to meet the mental health needs of a stu-
dent body that size, even if the center had
expanded hours and hired a handful of ad-
ditional staff to deal with the increase in
need.

Although Pitt tries to refer the students
with the greatest need to other providers
in the area, many students can’t afford to
go off-campus. Until recently, my mother’s
insurance didn’t cover any services more
than a few miles from my family home

in eastern Pennsylvania, and I couldn’t
even buy prescriptions in Pittsburgh. I’ve
gone a ﬁve-day stretch without my anti-
depressants because of the time it took
for Mom to mail them across the state.

fights and deaths among prisoners than
in the public system and a hidden con-
sequence: long—term contracts with pri-
vate corporations that cost the govern-
ment more in the long run than publicly
ﬁnanced prisons, even those that add to
governmental debt.

A study conducted by the Bureau of
Justice Assistance concluded that there
is no evidence that private prisons save
the government any money. Privatizing
government services doesn’t promote
free-market values, because conserva-
tive politicians are creating private en-
terprise that is dependent on govern-
ment contracts for their existence. The
case of prisons in New Jersey is indica-
tive of the growing conservative move-
ment to privatize government and un-
dermine necessary public services.

Public programs, if run correctly

and efficiently, can provide necessary
services and operate at a fraction of
the cost of privately run enterprise. By
maintaining necessary and basic servic-
es within the public realm and therefore
removing the profit motive, you remove
any possibility of cutting corners in or-
der to maximize proﬁts. Certain aspects
of society should not be subjected to the
corrosive repercussions of proﬁt-seek-
ing entities.

In Sweden, the pinnacle of the effec-
tive welfare state, all things deemed in
the public interest are controlled, ﬁ-
nanced and maintained by government.
Education, research, health care, social
services, infrastructure, military, pris-
ons and a plethora of ample social pro-
grams that would never be considered

for public funding in the United States A

are subsidized partially or in their en-
tirety in Sweden. This is funded through
a progressive tax system. Combined
local and central taxes amount to a 55

percent effective tax rate alongside a
25 percent sales tax. Total spending on
public programs amounts to 53 percent
of GDP and makes Sweden the country
with the second—highest tax burden in
the developed world, behind Denmark.
Most conservatives and even some mod-
erate liberals may cringe at this, but the
beneﬁts of this system are‘astronomi—
cal. Universal health care, totally subsi-
dized education at the K-12 and univer-
sity levels, five weeks of paid vacation
annually, and 480 days of paid materni-
ty and paternity leave for parents with
newborns, not to mention subsidized
daycare and subsidized public transit
are guaranteed to every citizen. Taxes
and big government aren’t tyranny if
you are getting your money’s worth and
government is effective and efficient.

In this country, there is an indoctri-
nated notion of radical individualism
that leads us to believe that dependence
on anyone else or on government is

parasitic and should be stopped. This
idea makes us believethat government
has no place in maintaining, improv-
iﬂg, and restoring people’s lives. Even
though government programs aren’t as
visible in the U.S. as in other industri-
alized countries, government agencies
ensure that our food is safe, our planes
won’t crash, our bridges won’t collapse
and that embassies abroad are available
to help citizens.

If the path in this country is to priva-

. tize essential services, then we can ex-

pect inadequate FEMA_ responses when
people need them the most, worsened
prison conditions, more E. coli con-

tamination and more plane crashes. We '

need to break away from radical indi-
vidualism and think of the collective in-
terest. It shouldn’t require major disas-
ters over the course of the past 20 years
for us to realize that big government is
sensible. I

"WRESTLING

SPORTS  

Core of motivated seniors ready to lead Panthers

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

' Every wrestler on this year’s Pitt squad wants

to become an All—American, and this -shared
desire is the greatest impact the class of 2012
has made on Pitt wrestling.

It’s not as though the senior class hasn’t

4 had success. Combined between the four se— *

niors are eight trips to the NCAA tournament
and six individual Eastern Wrestling League
(EWL) championships. But despite what it
has already achieved, Pitt’s 2012 senior class
has even more achievements planned for the
upcoming season.

When head coach Rande Stottlemyer’s
Panthers, ranked 18th in the NWCA—USA 8
Today Coaches’ Poll, take to the mat for their
ﬁrst dual meet of the season at Michigan on
Sunday, they will have four talented and ex-
perienced seniors in the starting lineup of 10
— one of the best classes he’s ever had.

Matt Wilps (197 pounds), Anthony Zanet-
ta (125 pounds), Zac Thomusseit (heavy-
weight or under 285 pounds) and Donnie
Tasser (149 pounds) have a combined over-
all record of 296-132 and have helped Pitt to
three straight EWL team championships.

Despite all of that success, this senior
class has only had one wrestler earn All-
American status, which comes from a top-
eight ﬁnish at the national tournament. Wil-
ps ﬁnished in fourth place last year.

“No one cares about how many wins
you have in wrestling, it’s about what you
do at nationals that everyone remembers,”

Pitt opens its season Sunday against No. 18 Michigan Huailei Wang | Senior Staff Photographer

Thomusseit said. “My personal goal is to be
wrestling in the national ﬁnals on Saturday
night, March 23. I think that’s every wres-
tler’s goal. Why wrestle to take third place? I
want to be a national champ, so that’s What
I’m training to do.”

Wilps himself acknowledges that he ac-
complished some of his goals in 2011, but the
biggest one remains in his sights this year.

“Some of my personal goals I have
achieved is yearly improvement and garner-
ing All-American status,” Wilps said. “This
year I hope to improve further by winning it

all.”

The senior, who wasranked No. 3 nation-
ally by InterMat, pinned then—No. 2 Quentin
Wright of Penn State at the NWCA All-Star
Classic last Saturday. The two wrestlers have
since swapped spots in the rankings.

With a win of that magnitude, it is easy to
see why several of the wrestlers look to their
teammates for inspiration. While wrestling
is a team sport, individuals need to attain
success for the team to win.

A startling new trend is taking the National
Football League by storm. No, it’s not the
two—running back system, or the hurry-
up offense or even the inundation of rules
reminiscent of ﬂag football. It’s the success
of the rookie quarterback.

The old thought process went like so:
Draft your “franchise QB,” ‘sit him on the
bench behind a learned veteran for several
years while the former grew accustomed
to the speed of the NFL, learned the intri-
cacies of his team’s offensive playbook and
the complexity of NFL defenses, wore his
headset properly, incited the sufficient is-
he-ready-or-not watercooler talk around
the city and all the rest of that jazz. The
Green Bay Packers, for example, used this
strategy to great effect with their Super
Bowl-winning and Discount Double Check-
dancing MVP quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.

That said, some teams preferred to

  Md. t.h¢.r<?iI;1s over right away; throwing

their rookie quarterbacks into the ﬁre, al-
beit with a much less condensed playbook.
This strategy worked for teams with low
expectations and a solid group of veterans
for the rookie to lean on while he learned
on the ﬂy, with the goal of progressing to a
solid team after a few years. The Colts did
this in Peyton Manning’s ﬁrst season in In-
dianapolis. '

The new trend has rendered the “adjust—
ment period” belief about as overrated as
the one-inning closer in baseball. Teams
are now drafting quarterbacks, tinkering
the playbook to [their particular strengths
and saying, “go have fun,” like moms drop-
ping their kids off at kindergarten. And it is
working.

Last season, Carolina Panthers quar-
terback Cam Newton destroyed ﬁrst-year
quarterback records, and an unheralded
redhead, Andy “—The Red Riﬂe” Dalton — a
second-round pick out of Texas Christian
University, a non-Bowl Championship Se-

ries school —— led the Cincinnati Bengals

ks playing with poise

(The Bengals!) to the playoffs.

A greater number of rookie signal call-
ers have found success this season. While
quarterbacks Andrew Luck (Indianapolis)
and Robert Grifﬁn III (Washington) — the
ﬁrst two picks in this year’s draft — have
been discussed, dissected and analyzed
more than the 2012 presidential election,
other rookie quarterbacks have made huge
impacts for their teams, as well.

Ryan Tannehill, the eighth overall pick
out of Texas A&M, and Russell Wilson, se—
lected in the third round out of Wisconsin,
have both opened eyes with their leader-

A ship qualities; each of their so-so teams

are in playoff contention. While it is true
that both quarterbacks have beneﬁted from
a strong running game and surprisingly
stout defenses, neither has wilted under
the pressure.

The lilliputian Wilson — standing a
mere 5-foot-11 — has shown moxie that

PITT IN THE NFL

McCoy hits
century mark

Sean _Corrado
Staff Wrz'ter

Former Panther LeSean McCoy led the Pitt
alumni to a successful week nine in the
NFL. Although none of their teams won,
the former Panthers put up some ﬁne per-
formances.

McCoy (Pitt 2007-2008) had close to
100 yards rushing for his Philadelphia Ea-
gles by halftime Monday, and just barely
eclipsed that mark before he was ‘dropped

from the game plan once the Eagles fell be- C

hind early in the second half. He ﬁnished
his day with 103 yards rushing and anoth-
er 14 yards receiving in a 28-13 loss to New
Orleans.

The former Pitt running back that lost
his starting job to McCoy back in his Pan-
thers days also had a solid showing.

Arizona Cardinal LaRod Stephens-
Howling (Pitt 2006-2008) carried thefball
17 times for 51 yards and added another 8
yards with a couple catches. He also scored

one of Arizona’s two touchdowns in a 17-31 __

loss to Green Bay.

Howlinghas ‘occupied the starting po-
sition since the Cardinals’ running back
core was hit with the injury bug. Opening-
day starter Beanie Wells should return
to practice next week and will be eligible
to play in week 12 against St. Louis. Once
Wells returns, look to ﬁnd Stephens—Howl-
ing’s role in the backﬁeld to diminish.

Wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt
2002-2003) scored Arizona’s other touch-
down against the Packers. He reeled in six
receptions for 74 yards — both of these
stats are his highest totals in four weeks.
Quarterback John Skelton has begun to
throw Fitzgerald’s way a bit more in recent
weeks, targeting him 12 times on Sunday.
The Cardinals’ bye next week gives the pair
an extended opportunity to work on their
chemistry in practice.

jabaal Sheard (Pitt 2007-2008) played
a strong game defensively against the
Baltimore Ravens, tallying a season-high
eight tackles for the Cleveland Browns.
Sheard also managed half of a sack in the
third quarter, which set up a scoring drive
for the Browns. Unfortunately, Baltimore
came out on top, 25-15.

Some Pitt alumni that rarely see pro-
fessional action made the box scores in
week nine.

Dorin Dickerson (Pitt 2006-2009) re— _
ceived some playing time for the Buffalo

2.

Bills at wide receiver last weekend and was
able to snag one catch for 13 yards.

That catch raised his season total to
three. I

and that is importan 3’-

» "The current streak of three straight reg-
ular-season EWL championships and two
straight EWL tournament championships
will come to an end after this season, even if
the Panthers take both crowns in 2012. Pitt
wrestling, like every other Pitt NCAA Divi-
sion I sport, will be moving to the ACC in
2013. ‘ ' '

In InterMat’s 2012 ‘preseason team rank-
ings, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)

' and EWL placed four teams in the top 50.

The EWL and ACC’s average rankings for its
top four squads were 26 and 28.25,_ respec-
tively. Pitt is No. 15 this year, only two spots
behind the ACC’s best team, No. 13 Virginia
Tech. While the conferences are similar, the
ACC will leap ahead of the EWL by adding
the Panthers, providing them with a greater
challenge.

“The ACC has great competition, and that
will facilitate our program in an iron-sharp-
ens—iron fashion,” Wilps said.

With the same “iron-sharpens-iron” mot-
to, the Blue and Gold’s wrestlers train and
practice near their limits to gain the greatest

beneﬁt. - \

“I would just say that our recent success
has come from hard W01‘. ” Thomusseit said.
“We have pushed our training to probably the
highest it can go and the coaches are around
making sure we are pushing ourselves to the
physical limit. The coaches gear practice
towards the caliber of guys we have on the
team. On average, a guy loses six to eight
pounds in a practice. We have a hard practice
and condition right after so that we get the
feeling of being physically drained and still
being able to wrestle.”

That hard work isn’t something that
comes naturally, and the senior class is step-
ping up as the leaders of the team to ensure
the successful ﬁiture of Pitt wrestling.

“It’s a hard road to travel along, and for
some of these kids, it will be one of the tough-
est life tasks they will face,” Zanetta said.
“You need to be mentally strong and always

have a positive mindset, or else it can be a-

rough roa .”

Pitt’s seniors have managed that rough
road so far, but with one ﬁnal season in the
EWL left, the Panthers still control what their
legacy will be.

“Our senior class is an example of where
the program is headed,” Wilps said. “The
outcome of the season will determine how
big of a legacy we leave with Pi .”

The 2008 class, which graduated the year
before Thomusseit and Wilps arrived on
campus, had a national champion and sev-
eral All-Americans. Despite the success of
their teammates, not everyone on that team
or the one the year after was striving to be the
greatest.

“The mood and the atmosphere [since
freshman year] has been more positive,”
Thomusseit said. “My freshmen year, we had
a team that had a few individuals that were

_ actually trying to place at nationals, and now

We pretty much have to get the whole lineup
hungry to get on the podium at the NCAA
tournament.” I

made sportswriters like Grantland editor
Bill Simmons fall in love with him by lead-
ing the Seattle Seahawks to gutsy wins over
Green Bay and New England and a near up-
set of San Francisco; the Seahawks are 5-4
and clinging to the ﬁnal playoff spot in the
NFC.

Tannehill, meanwhile, inherited a 6-10
Miami Dolphins team and currently has
them on the verge of the playoffs, too. Fol-
lowing Miami’s extremely entertaining loss
to Indianapolis —— when rookies Luck and
Tannehill combined for 723 yards passing
and three touchdowns in a 23-20 Colts vic-
tory — the Dolphins sit at 4-4 and only one
spot out of the playoffs in the muddle of me-
diocrity that is the AFC.

Old myths are being destroyed with the
inﬂux of talented college football quar-
terbacks. The reasons are two—fold, and

they perpetuate each other. For one, NCAA

football has advanced to the point that
NFL coaches are looking to university pro-
grams for innovations — not the other way
around. Teams like Oregon and Oklahoma
State are allowing their athletic players a
new level of freedom on the ﬁeld; the result
is scoring in bunches and a quickened ma-
turity at the most crucial decision-making
position, quarterback. Meanwhile, . NFL

head coaches are quicker to brush off the '

old myths about quarterbacks, placing less
emphasis on height and pocket: passing. In-
stead, they are trusting their quarterbacks’
instincts and natural athletic abilities.
Football is evolving. Quarterbacks are
now extremely athletic and are allowed to
freestyle the way Evgeni Malkin does on
ice for the Pittsburgh Penguins. Because
of these game—changing abilities, coaches
are less apt to give them structured plays,
thus allowing for free and unburdened play

while simultaneously putting the game in.

the hands of their young charges. And, boy,
is it fun to watch. I -
