Rainbow Alliance hosts its legendary annual Drag Show as part of Pride Week festivities.

For The Pitt News

Last night after the sun went down
in Oakland, the William Pitt Union
saw showers of glitter, condoms
and money. ,_

Thirteen drag performances by
Pitt students and alumni turned
gender, a concept commonly
viewed as black and white, into
a spectrum running the rainbow
from masculi_ne.to feminine and
everything in between.

Members of the Rainbow Al‘-
liance, Pitt’s student advocacy

..\, ﬂax: .\ —L:v..

group for lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgendered students, per-
formed their annual Drag Show in
the Assembly Room to a packed
student audience.

Each spring, the Rainbow Al-

liance hosts Pride Week, a string a

of events to increase the aware-

»-ness and acceptance of Pitt’s LGBT

community. It’s a natural follow-
up to National Coming Out Week,
Rainbow Alliance Presidentjames
Weaver said.

“National Coming Out Week is
about comingout, and Pride Week
is to celebrate the fact that you’re
able to live out of the closet,”

he Rainbow Alliance’s Pride Week Drag Show. The

organization raised $1,396 for charity at the show.

Weaver said.

This year’s ninth annual Pride
Week included events ranging
from lectures to speak—outs to
dodgeball tournaments, but its
Drag Show was inarguably the
most popular.

And for former Pitt students
and drag show legends Veronica
Bleaus and Dani Lamorte, it was a
ﬁnal performance. 4

‘The center of attention’

By 5 p.m. yesterday, Dempsey
Young’s eyebrows were covered in

white makeup.

’By 8:45 p.m. his eyelids were

painted blue, and when the show '

began at 9 p.m., he emerged from
the curtain in a high-slit pink
gown, his black bra exposed.
. He was a she —— Young-had be-
come Dominique Da’Hoe. 6 V
For Young,’ senior co-host of
this year’s drag show, dressing in
drag is all about gender subver-
sion. “It’s about showing what our
society creates asgender as some-
thing that can be put on and per-
formed and not something that’s
innate that you are born with,”
he said. ’ ’
“Gender is an act. It’s a verb,”

Pitt to repair library
patio leaks by fall

Katie Campbell

For The Pitt‘News ‘

By the end of this summer, the fences
on the I-Iillrnan Library’s patio might
ﬁnally come down.

Though workers blocked off the
construction site this past fall, Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele anticipated
that “repair work will start in late
spring.” .

Workers putfences around the pa-
tio so they could begin testingto ﬁnd
out where the leaks were located and
to prevent people from tripping over
construction materials, Pitt spokes-
woman Patricia White said.

Theywill repair leaks in the “wa-
terprooﬁngmembrane surface,”arub—
bery layer of material underthe stone
patio, which is meant to keep water
from seeping into the ground ﬂoor of
Hillman Library. They hope to ﬁnish
repairs by the end of the summer.

The waterprooﬁng membrane
surface is a rubberized material that
comes in sheets and is bonded to-
gether, White said. “Lack of bonding
maybe causing the leaks.”

The damage is limited to ceiling
tiles and paint on the ground ﬂoor of
the library, she said.

Facilities Management is looking
forawayto repairthe damaged sheets
insteadof completely replacingthem,
she said.

It has taken a while to research
and to develop a plan for the repair
solution, but Fedele predicted “the
project will be completed by the end
of summer.” '

The construction “will not involve
substantial demolition, and repair
noise will be limited,” Fedele said.

A bookyou can’t put down

Does the popularity of e—books signal the end of printed text for students?

. John Manganaro
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

The ﬁllllre of the written word came
under scrutinylastnightinroom G—24
of the Cathedral of Learning.

There, essayist Sven Birkerts and
blogger Maud Newton participated in
aforumtitled “The Future ofthe Book.”
The two discussed electronic reading

technology, like Amazon’s Kindle and
the Sony Reader, andwhatimpact such

devices couldhave onPittandthe major v

publishing companies.
Birkerts wore a demure tweed
jacket, putting him in stark contrast
with Newton and her ﬁre engine red
dress. Botharguedthe movement into
electronic media is equallypositive and
negative—though Birkerts’ comments
had a distinctly apocalyptic ﬂavor.

“IfI have areputationinthewriting
world, it is that of a Luddite,” Birkerts
said. “Solitude, subjectivity, focus and
the cultural novel are being destroyed
by the myriad screen tools we all de-
pend on  I see these e-readers as a
kind of gateway drug. Individuality and
meditation are at stake.”

In‘ anticipation of this discussion,
English professorjeff Oaks explored
the pros and cons of elecuonic readers.

Everyﬂatsurfacewas coveredbybooks ‘

stacked ﬁve deep.

Oaks doesn’t own an e-reader,
but he frequently uses the Kindle ap-
plication on his phone. He sat back at
his desk, at ease among the scholarly
splendor. '

“I boughtthe Kindle application irn-
mediately after I went for the iPhone,”
Oaks said. “I was all giddy, like ‘Oh my
God,’ I have access to all of literature
on here.’ That’s the appeal of the e-
readers, you can have so much at your
ﬁngertips.” ’

Inatime dorninatedbythe Internet
and cable television —where audiences

cannavigatethousands of channels and
millions- of web pages — the appeal of
reading often gets overlooked, Oaks
said. Butwhen you factorinan e-read-
er’s ability to receive e-mails and even
daily newspapers, the written word
might once again be able to compete.

Oaks adjustedhis glasses and satup
inhis chair, heftingan ancient-looking
volume of Chinese poetry.

“Onlythebookasanartifactisin ‘

trouble,” Oaks said, thumbingthrough

thepages.“Ifabookwereonlywordswe ’

would have no issue  the tran-‘
sition to e-readers. But a book is also

the cover art, the weight, the turning
of pages.”

Hours later, in a slightly less-
cluttered office in the Writing Center,
English professorGeetaKathari mo
agreed with Oaks. '

Flanked on one side by a Mac and
iPhone, completewithe-readerapplica-

tion,and onthe otherbyseveral shelves '

ofbooks, Katharialso speculated about
the future of the written word.

“It’s the turning of pages thing that
makes thetransitionseemso dramatic,”
Kathari said. “Right now I’m reading a
digital copy of ‘The Nether World’ by
George Gissing, and it's pretty great.
I can carry a 400-page novel in my
pocket, one I can’t even ﬁnd in prin ”

Scrolling through the digital pag-
es, Kathari said she can see e-readers
catching on as an attractive option for

travelers, or those who don’t have the
space foradecent library.

Molly Stieber, a Pitt student and .

Student Government Board member,
seems wise to the professors’ predic-
tions. She is working on a project to
educate policy~making University of-
ﬁcials about electronic textbooks. '

. Stieber wants Pitt to get on board ‘

with a ‘company calledjumpbooks, a

_ digitaltextbookaggregatewhichwodcs
withsome oftoday’s largestbookpub—

lishing companies.

Jumpbooks deals books in atotally
ditl'erentwayﬁ'omacampus bookstore,
she said, similar to textbook renting.

With the bookstore, students typi— l

cally purchase aprinted book atanew
or lightly used price and then hope to
sell itbackto get aﬁactionalremrn. But
withjumpbooks, the buyer purchases a
180.-day subscription to an electronic
textbook that can be downloaded di-
_rectly to a laptop, usually for less than
halfthe cost. -

Stieberwarned of the dramatic con-
sequences facing Pitt if the University
ignores electronic textbooks.

“If Pitt waits much longer to cut a
dealto workwithjumpbooks they risk

_ losingtextbook revenues alltogether,”

Stiebersaid. “When studentsturnaway
fromthe bookstoreto outside electron-
ic textbook vendors, as they will when
they can pay $99 for a textbook that
would normally cost $230, the Univer-

' sitywillfalloutofthe marke ”

No one from the University Book
Centerwas available for comment about
the issue of e-textbooks yesterday, but
Stieber said she thinks the trend is a
sign. . .
“If14 of the biggest printed-book
publishing companies are moving into
e—textbooks and e-books, isn’t that a
good indicator that Pitt should too?”
she asked. “Who knows the ﬁiture of
books betterthanthe publishing com-
panies?” A . ’

Drag Show director and co-host Dylan
Drobish explained. And during the show,

Drobishcontinued to point out the rigidity I

of gender-related pronouns.

Dempsey Young:

 

rushed the stage to deposit donations in
sagging pants, bras ﬁlled with socks and
open mouths.

The goal was to raise $1,500 this year,

 m:ajoriis..ue not only  

    

    

Drobish and Young teamed up, one king
and one queen, to co-host the event which
raises money for the Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force, an organization dedicated to pre-
venting the spread of HIV and improving
the quality of life for people living with the

' disease. Admission to the show was free, but

students were encouraged to donate money
both during and after the performances,
Weaver said.

Throughout the performances — Ve-A

ronica Bleaus’ high-kicking to “Fame,”

Suki Sudoku’s hip-popping to Ciara and .’

Josh Long’s -thrusting to Sisqo — students

$200 more than last year’s total, Weaver
said. _

Throughout the year, the Pittsburgh
AIDS Task Force has worked on campus to
provide safe sex workshops, HIV testing
and counseling services. This is our way of

' thanking them, Weaver said. .

“AIDS is a major issue not only in the
queer community but also in the overall
community. As part of Pride Week, you have
to take into account the good things and the
badthings that come along with, you know,
life,” Young said. I

  Drag Show raises money, skirts

\

ing the event to represent both king and
queen culture.

¢“Pittsburg_h has a pretty decentdrag
community, and there’s a lot of drag shows,
but normally they don’t include drag kings,”
Young said. ' T

To Weaver, drag is valued for its nov-
elty —— something that is harder for kings
to create. ' s

“It has to do with how society is, because
it’s a lot more acceptable for females to
dress up as guys than it is for guys to dress
up as girls. So kings just have to work that
much harder to show that they’re not just up
there dressed up like a guy and that they’re
actually putting on a different persona,”
Weaver said.

In the end when the lights dimmed, nei-
ther Drobish nor Young appeared on stage.

Instead the audience was greeted by their .

‘alter egos —— Dominique Da’Hoe and Dylan
-Dickhersoon.

' V Da’Hoe ﬂittered around in a blonde wig
and heels impersonating Taylor Swift, and
Dickhersoon arrived in studded pants,
crotch-grabbing and ﬁnger—gun wielding

his way down the runway. W

_ When you’re on stage, you get to a certain
point, Young said. “You are fabulous. You
are it-. You are the center of attention.”

“The biggest challenges are in keeping the
disruption to library patrons from the noise at a
minimum,” keeping entrances openwhile work-

For now, the construction site remains fenced

still has not been ﬁnalized,” White said.

Toyota seeks cosmic aid

The ailing car manufacturer tries to blame malfunctions. on cosmic rays.

Jacob Brown
Columnist

   

If you haven’t been paying attention
to the automotive industry lately,
Toyota has currently led a campaign
toward alienating its customers,
recalling nearly 8 million vehicles
worldwide.

With cars that have reportedly
had failing brakes, sticking accel-
erator pedals and brand-new trucks

that are already rusting apart, the
once-invincible Tokyo-based manu-
facturer has done everything a com-
pany could possibly do to sink itself
into ruin. I _

Even Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniak made headlines back in
February when he reported a soft-
ware glitch that made his 2010 Prius
accelerate up to 97 mph without his
foot on the pedal.

But in the midst of Toyota’s
woes, the company has recently
reported increased stock prices
even before March’s strong sales

numbers were released. Why? Well,
they’ve increased incentives for
customers, and loyal Toyota buy-
ers haven’t abandoned the brand.
But as strange as it might sound,
the answer could in part be cosmic
rays from outer space. A

Yes, the federal government
recently turned over Toyota’s un-
intended-acceleration case to NASA

A to see if cosmic rays could be inter-

fering with the electronic throttles
found in many Toyotas. That bit
suggests that maybe the company
didn’t under-' engineer their cars —
excellent news for investors. Rather,

the universe’s invisible frequencies”

have created miniature Bermuda
Triangles that hover around Toyo-
tas. And Satan recently purchased
a Zamboni, too.

NASA is supposed to publish a
conclusive study detailing its ﬁnd-
ings, but I’m a bit skeptical about
its methodology. Toyota officials
told the Detroit Free Press that its
electronics systems should be able
to withstand such radiation, but the

ﬁndings won’t be ofﬁcial until July
when this “sudden acceleration”
ﬁasco will be less in the minds of
the buying public. Still, history has
shown it takes time for an auto com-
pany’s image to make a comeback
after a shameful situation.

Back in 1983, Volkswagen’s
Audi luxury brand faced a similar
situation, and it ended up needing
a decade to recover from its un-
intended acceleration brouhaha,
which stemmed from the gas pedal’s

proximity to the brake and owners '

confusing the two. And Ford failed
to retain sales leadership with its
Explorer after the 1990s when it
had to recall 4 million trucks with
defective tires.

So what makes Toyota so spe-
cial? Chock it up to an amazing re-
covery team. 4

Initially when CEO Akio Toyoda I

came out of hiding back injanuary
to meet with the media, he drove off
in a brand-new Audi after his inter-
view instead of one of his own cars.
A month later, word broke that the

Brown > 5

PRcampaign

Brown 4 4

company allegedly had‘ withheld
evidence of safety problems with
its cars as earlyas 2004.

Then the PR team came to the
rescue with an aggressive $1 billion
incentive plan for new cars on top
of the $2 billion Toyota had already
thrown at recall ﬁxes.

It probably didn’t hurt matters,-

either, that Toyota’s Chris Tinto,

vice president of the company’s'

regulatory affairs in Washington,

Trafﬁc Safety Administration’s Of-

ﬁce of Defects Investigation.

So there’s a real chance we might
never know what the ofﬁcial cause
of Toyota’s recent quality woes have
been. Toyota has become a cowboy,
successﬁilly wrangling its problems
in a lasso of obfuscation and tossing
them down a gorge where no one
will ﬁnd them.

And like it or not, this will prob-
ably become a textbook lesson for
business students on how to remain
successful in spite of mixed mes-
sages andseveral initial blunders

during the investigation in which
Toyota representatives claimed
nothing was wrong with their
cars. '
As the world’s economic cli-
mate still sits in a state of ﬂux, any
company could quickly ﬁnd itself
crippled by any sort of defect to
a point where recovery might not
be possible without bankruptcy,
so self-defense is essential. These
companies have a responsibility
to their shareholders to minimize
expenses and maximize proﬁts,

which could be why Toyota uses a
cheaper, inferior gaspedal in many
of their North American-sold prod-
ucts from the CTS Corp. instead of
a unit made by Denso that hasn’t
caused any problems.

Toyota uses what it calls kaizen
manufacturing, giving line work-
ers a pull cord so they can stop the
assembly line to ﬁx defects. But
Toyota should have done the same
thing on a corporate level in 2004
when its quality started slipping.

To allude to Kanye West, I don’t

Workingfor embattled Toyota  

_think Toyota has cared about its

customers until now. If they did,
they wouldn’t have let these rela-
tively easy-to-ﬁxproblems acceler-
ate out of control.

For now, federal heel—dragging
will surely help Toyota polish up its
now-tarnished reputation. But if
Toyota really wants to regain con-
sumer trust, it should keep its col-
lective head to the ground searching
for ﬁxes -— not up at the cosmos.

PROFILE

Pitt alumna starts a ‘beautiful’ movement

Lexie Band
For The Pitt News

Pitt alumna Caitlin Boyle’s mes-
sage to the world is simple: you
are beautiful.

Her mission to spread that
message evolved into a movement
called Operation Beautiful that has
women across the country posting
anonymous Post-it notes with pos-
itive and encouraging messages on
the mirrors of public bathrooms.

Fans of the Operation Beautiful
blog post messages like, “Hi there
beautiful,” “Never forget to respect

- and love yourself” and “I KNOW

you are beautiful in every way.”
“The goal of Operation Beau-

tiful is to transform the way you

see yourself, one Post-it at a time,”

. Boyle said.

And Operation Beautiful cer-
tainly has transformed many
things — including Boyle’s own
life. '

According to Boyle, who gradu-
ated from Pitt as a nonﬁction writ-
ing and political science major in

2006, Operation Beautiful began,

as a random act of kindness and
has since evolved into a popular

blog and a book, almost uninten—’

tionally. ,

“One night I was inspired to
write ‘You are beautiful’ on a Post-
it and stick it to a mirror in a public
bathroom,” she said.

She took a picture of the note
and posted it on her blog, Healthy-
TippingPoint.com, and asked her
readers to participate.

“Withinla few days, my inbox
was ﬂooded with similar pictures.
I knew right away I had something
special" on my hands and launched

‘fl was so overstretched work-
wise that I was making myself
miserable,” she said. “I landed
the book deal so I could quit my
job.” . i .

The book, which comes out this
August, will feature 125 Operation
Beautiful notes and interviews
with the women who posted them.
The book will also include Boyle’s
tips‘ on how to lead a more positive
and fulﬁlling life.

“I would love to see women,

_ and men too, thinking_ more

positively about themselves and
how they can help other people,”
Boyle said. “I think that, by post-
ing notes, we’re spreading posi-
tive self image. Also, I think the

posters are really writing notes
to themselves, and it gives them
conﬁdence, too.” ’

Since starting the movement, A"
Boyle has received many unique .

Operation Beautiful notes. Her fa-
vorites are the ones written in the
snow or in sand at the beach.

v Operation Beautiful also helps
Boyle see the beauty in others.
She said the movement helped
her learn that “people are so much
nicer than you think they are.”

“I really believe most people
want to help others,” she said.
“Some women stay up all night
writing hundreds of Operation
Beautiful notes to post. It’s amaz-I
ing how dedicated people are to
the idea of random acts .of kind-
ness.”

ANALYSIS

Anti — giracy intern
recruited at UK. school

Warmer Bros. calls in a. student to bust his torrenting peers.

Kelsey Shea
Assistant A&E Editor

I like to romanticize the ongoing battle
between record labels and torrent sites.
With the big players on the torrent side
of things having names like Mininova and

t The Pirate Bay, it isn’t hard to imagine that

the guys running the BitTorrent sites are
young Robin Hoods or Luke Skywalkers
with a noble mission to deliver music to
the masses, battling through the Internet
to spread their good will’. ~

But in reality, it isn’t nearly that exciting.
It’s completely free of light sabers, spies,
cannon-equipped pirate ships and dashing
archers dressed in green. L ’

It’s paper pushing. It’s motherboards.
It’s straight—up boring. .

But now at least these torrenters’ oppo— A‘

nent, the music industry, has developed a
controversial weapon against piracy that’s
slightly less dull — an anti-piracy intern. .
Warner Bros. UK is recruiting a young,
bright, up-and-coming member of our tor-
rent—loving, free—music generation to help
them put a stop to illegal downloading.
It’s an interesting move for the media
giant..For a_computer science major looking

for employment, it’s an appealing offer. The
year-long internship pays about $26,000
(17,500 pounds), and is anice credential
on any resumé. ’

But the downside is pretty obvious —
in playground talk, the intern would be a
total snitch. .

The ad for the position stated that the
job would entail “monitoring local Internet
forums and IRC for pirated [Warner Bros.
and NBC Universal] content in orderto
gather information on pirate sites, pirate
groups and other pirate activities,” as well

‘ as various other anti-piracy duties. M

An unidentified Warner Brother’s
‘spokesman told PC World, that hiring stu-
dent spies is, “legal and it is avery common
practice.”

Warner Bros. is recruiting from the Uni-
versity of Manchester for a computer savvy
student to ﬁll the position. The deadline was
yesterday, so pretty soon some (debatably)
lucky student will have secured the spot.

Torrent news site TorrentFreak wel-
comed any of its users to apply for the in-
ternship and feed them information about
Warner Bros.’ anti-piracy efforts. It’s a bit
far-fetched, but maybe there will be some
‘dvouble—agent?spy business happening after
all. One can only hope for that kind of plot
twist. b

Spy or not, I don’t envy whoever ﬁlls the
position. Being a professional tattletale is a
tough spot to put yourself in, and backlash
from peers is a guarantee. One commenter
calling himself “dude” on TorrentFreak
posted, “Only a low-life “would sell his/her
soul to the MAAFIA 8: Co.” ,

But money talks, and when there’s
$26,000 on the line, people are bound to

A start lining up.

_ he ﬁnal rounds of the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament will occur this weekend, and believe it or not, Pitt is once again not a part of the action. But wait, Pitt fans, there’s

still hope to be had. Start at the Pitt logo atop this page and follow each colored path downward, and you’ll ﬁnd that our Panthers are a lot closer to the Final Four than they
may seem. Once this page has you feeling better; e—mail -

sports@pittnews.com with your best shot at linking Pitt to a
Final Four team (using a minimum of ﬁve degrees ofsepara—
tion), and ﬁnd outifyou’re better than Coach Dixon at making
it to the Final Four. You might just see it in print.

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
      
  
 
    

  

In 2010, Pitt gave the
then-undefeated Syracuse

1994.
