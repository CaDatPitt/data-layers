SGB member calls
l> for resignations
at The Pitt News

By Christine Hanna
Asst. News Editor

The calling of the resigna-
tions of several members of
The Pitt News and the recent
controversy of the presidential
scholarships held precedence
at ‘ Friday’s Student
Government Board meeting.

“This past week on
Thursday, The Pitt News ran
two articles: one on sexual
assault and one dealing with
police excessive force and
brutality. My problem with
these two articles is the lack
of responsibility on the news-
paper’s part,” SGB member
Jacob Brody said.

Brody said that the headline
of the article, “Police accused
of using excessive force,” was
misleading.

“Because this is a campus
newspaper, the assumption
can be made that this is cam-
pus police using excessive
force. In fact, the article deals
with the Pittsburgh Police, but
most students will probably

not spend the tinie to read the
whole article thoroughly. The
irresponsibility of the
reporters in this article is dis-

turbing, not just to myself, but

to many students as well as
the administration,” Brody
said. ' V

Brody said that the second
and greater problem was that
The Pitt News reporters pub-
lished the name of a sexually
assaulted victim.

“This is something that most
newspapers, probably all of
them, do not do and should
not be done,” Brody said.
“What they have caused for
this individual is a lot of trau-
ma now that is probably going
to continue. The suspect or
whoever committed this crime
now knows who this person is
and where they can probably
find them, not that they knew
where they lived before,” he
said.

Brody said, “I was told that
the City of Pittsburgh Police
was very disturbed and feels

Campus groups come together to examine intolerance

By Christine Hanna
Asst. News Editor

Panelists of diverse campus organiza-
tions discussed alternatives to intoler-
ance at Thursday night’s cultural diversi-
ty forum.

“We have to move away from point-’

ing the finger and take a deep look into
ourselves,” Bruce Anthony Jones,
Assistant Professor in the Graduate
School of Education, said. S
Jones said that there is a need to

change the behavior within ourselves
and the institutions. It is simply not
enough to just implement programs, but
there is a need for change in attitudes
and beliefs.

Members from the Affirmative Action
Office, Bisexual Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, Black Action Society,’ B’n_ai
B’Rith Hillel, Campus Women’s
Organization, Disabled Student Services,

GPSA confronting TA problems

By Matt Groff
For the Pitt News

Facing a problem of shrink-
ing resources and a greater
workload for Teaching
and Teaching
Fellowships, the Graduate
and Professional Student
Association is taking steps to
deal with these issues.

Recently, GPSA announced
that it will make office space
available to TAs and TF5 to
meet with undergraduate stu-
dents.

“We think that, in order for
TAs and TF5 to do a good
job, they must be given ade-
quate resources. We often
hear complaints about TAs
and TF5 meeting with stu-
dents in hallways or Roy

Rogers.

“The purpose of this plan is
to offer a professional atmos-
phere for them to work
with their students. A confer-
ence room in the William Pitt
Union will be‘ available to
TAs/TF5 on Wednesday and
Friday mornings, 9 a.m. to
1 p.m., upon request,” busi-
ness manager of GPSA and
organizer of this plan David
Fitz said.

Fitz said that this program
will also help determine the
scope of the office space
problem at Pitt, “Depending
on how many TAs and TF5
reserve space, we will have a
better grasp on the size of this
problem and what needs to
be done in the future.”

“This is really an undergrad-

uate issue, even though it
isn’t perceived that way yet.
Undergraduate students pay a
lot of money for their classes
and they should expect to be
taught by people with basic
resources such as office
It should be the
department’s responsibility to
be certain there is space for
TAs/TF5 to meet with their
students,” GPSA President
Steve Parks said.

“I know of many professors
who have the luxury of two
offices, I don’t see why this is
necessary

cubicle with three other peo— S

Parks said this plan will

ance.

An act of intolerance is defined as
“any attempt to injure, harm, malign, or
harass a person because of race, reli-
gion, color, national origin, handicap,
age, sex, or sexual orientation. Such
behavior includes acts or attempts
which may pose physical or psychologi-
cal harm or threat to individuals, to
groups, to the university or to the com-

munity. An act of intolerance differs-

from other acts of intimidation or crimi-
nal behavior because it is motivated by

hatred of the characteristics or beliefs in
contrast to insensitive acts, which may
be the result of lack of awareness.

“We can never have enough forums
or dialogues like this,” Jones said.

Lois O’Donnell said that the handi-
capped have a more difficult problem.
“We don’t have one thing that binds us
together, except disability, not one race,
religion or ethnicity.”

O’Donnell said that it is difficult to
promote the idea that there is a prob-

Last week, due to a late night mix-up in pro-
duction, The Pitt News unintentionally printed
the name of a sexually assaulted victim. This is
not and never has been our normal policy. Our
policy is to never print the name of a rape or
sexual assault victim. We are sorry for the error
and apologize to the woman involved.-

We want to stress to the university community
that a victim’s name will not_be published in
our newspaper again. We have installed more
checks and balances into our production sys-
tem to ensure that something of such a nature
can never go through to print.

All staff members have been informed of the
policy not to publish names of victims and all
new writers will receive the policy before they
begin to write for us.

We have settled the matter internally with our
staff. If anyone would like to express their opin-
ion on the matter, we encourage them to write a
letter to the editor at 434 William Pitt Union.

Cultural Peﬁa raises spirits and funds for Cuba

By Beth Kovaly
Staff Writer

The lights were dimmed as the salsa
band Guaracha took the stage — maracas
beatinga meringue rhythm. The dance
ﬂoor soon ﬁlled with people moving to the
beat, some even singing along with the
Spanish words.

The music was only one part of Cultural
Pena, a benefit to raise funds for sending

_ medical aid to Cuba.

Cultural Pena was sponsored by the
Pittsburgh Committee for Medical Aid to
Cuba. Co-chair Melanie Bozic said the
event is aimed at drawing attention to the
embargo the United States has had on
Cuba since 1961.

' The cultural event was held in the base-
ment rooms of the Church of
Reconciliation in Oakland. Greg Anderson
said he came to Cultural Pena partly
because he was a member of the church
but also out of interest.

The embargo prohibits any trade or
exchange with the U.S. or any trading part-
ners of the U.S. — -

“We have chosen to take this route to
protest in our own way the discriminatory
embargo,” Bozic said. “We thought it

very specifically in this case, medical aid to
Cuba.” . .

For a donation of ten dollars, guests
were treated to a variety of Cuban culture,
dance, music, poetry, food and lecture.
José Correal, also co-chair for the
Pittsburgh committee, described the history
of a peﬁa as he served up gallo pinto, a
dish of black beans and rice.

“The word comes from Chile. There you
could not have any political groups gather-
ing, it had to be a social gathering. It’s a
get-together where you mix culture and
politics,” Correal said.

After the meal Dr. Jose Moreno, from the

Pitt Department of Sociology, spoke on the

Cuban health system.

“The problem is indeed a humanitarian
problem — sending drugs and medication
to Cuba,” Moreno said. “But we cannot

ignore the political problem that we are

facing and that Cuba faces. The stronghold

'lof the United States] on Cuba grows

tighter and tighter.”

The Pitt professor said Cuba is in need
of medical supplies now more than ever.
Its relationships with countries it has trad-
ed with in the past, such as
Czechoslovakia, the former East Germany
and the former Soviet Union, are not on
the best of terms. Some are no longer even
countries.

Moreno said whether or not Cuban
leader Fidel Castro is in power should not
be an issue to the United States but rather
to aid various children’s hospitals with
much—needed supplies. He highlighted his
recent personal trips to Cuba as well as
experiences from living there.

After the lecture, there was Cuban danc-
ing to the salsa band, a poetry reading and
a salsa dance workshop for what Correal
called teasingly the “dancing impaired.”

“A Cuban event is good. We don’t get to
see always a balanced picture of Cuba. We
get to see what the Bush administration
and the government put in the news,”
Anderson said. “Tm interested in hearing
more from people who’ve been to Cuba
— in celebrating a culture that is basically
closed to us.”

Not all attending were mainly interested
in the political aspect of Cuba. Gail
Gregory, who said she was from Pittsburgh
and planet Earth, said she came because,
“I’m always receptive to benefits for caus-
es. It just intrigued me.” One student from
Carnegie Mellon said she came because
she was very interested in Cuban music
and dance.

Aid to Cuba is a sub-committee of the larg-

larger one,‘she said.

The handicapped have to
have a political voice.
Otherwise, people outside will
not know what is happening,
O’Donnell said.

Adam Novak, a member of
BiGALA, said the gay commu-
nity is also diverse, it is not one
sexuality, race, religion or gen-
der.

“In a lot of ways we are
invisible,” Novak said.

Novak said that people need
to find some way within them-

comments pass by.

Intolerance occurs daily in
the resident halls, Director of
the Office of Residence Life Jo
Ann Woodson said.

She said that there is a lot of
education to be taught and
many adjustments to be made
to help the intolerance prob-
lem.

“I believe making a change
requires two kinds of actions:
taking a stand and working in
the institution,” Woodson said.

Geoffrey R. Wood, director of
the International Student
Services, said that the United
States does not know enough

' about the rest of the world

because of "that “we—are—
the-greatest-that—there-is” atti-
tude.

Many Jewish jokes are forms I

of subtle and overt ethnovio-
lence, things that people say or
do unintentionally, said Cindy
Goodman Leib, acting director
of B’nai B’rith Hillel.

“Racism has had most devas-
tating impact  on many of us
sitting in this room,” BAS
President Marcus Guy said.

Guy said that the most
important area to attack is the
curriculum. Cultural diversity
has to have an institution
behind it that shows commit-
ment. X

Jen Swoboda, co—president of
CWO, said that women face the
big problem of sexual harass-
ment on campus. People need
to know what it is and what
can be done.

“Date and acquaintance rape ‘

is a problem on many campus-
es and here at Pitt,” Swoboda
said.

Swoboda said that the
Women’s Studies Department
needs to be expanded, there is
not enough faculty in the pro-
gram.

CWO _co-President Jenna
Ferrara said that the problems
for women at Pitt range from
the need for child care, sexual
assault and the minority rate of
the small number of women
professors.

Ferrara said that in the
Anthropology Department only
10 percent of the faculty are
women and the Chemistry
Department has no women at
all.

William Savage of the
Affirmative Action Office said
that pamphlets on sexual
harassment and discrimination
on sexual orientation will be
out for distribution in three to
four weeks.

problems with which grad students must deal. He said a
recent survey taken by the GPSA showed the details of
which will be released at their first meeting. The study
found 40 percent of TAs/TFs work more than 20 hours per
week while their departments require them to report 20
hours of work or less. Also, the survey shows that 31 per-
cent of TAs/TF5’ said their workload was “negatively”
impacting on their progress. Parks insisted that undergrads
are directly affected by these burdens as well as a lack of
other resources, such as training.

“Many undergraduates don’t realize that most depart-
ments, with the exception of English, don’t train TA/TF5 to
be teachers When an undergrad goes to class, it can be
very frustrating for him to try to learn from someone with
no teaching experience or training. It is mutually frustrat-
ing to the TA when he sees poor results from students,”
Parks said.

Fitz hopes that by providing office space, GPSA will be
more in touch with Pitt grad students..Parks said with
more involvement and feedback, GPSA can better serve
the needs of grad students and raise awareness of the
issues they encounter.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 21, 1992

SGB

insulted and cheated and probably
most likely will not deal with [The Pitt
News] again.

“I am not sure how The Pitt News
will handle this entirely. The reporters,
or The Pitt News staff members and the
whole editorial board should seriously
reconsider the positions of the
reporters on this matter and them-
selves, because it is a blatant lack of
responsibility on their part and the fact
they represent the media of this uni-
versitydisturbs us greatly,” Brody said.

Brody also addressed the controver-
sy surrounding the giving of scholar-
ships to student government presi-
dents. He explained that the money
for the scholarship comes from the
Student Activities fee, but that the stu-
dent body does not have control over
that allocation.

“When we pay our student activities
fees to the University of Pittsburgh,

that money belongs to the University «.

of Pittsburgh to do as they see fit. It is
there specifically to be used for stu-
dent activities. There is approximately
$800,000, I believe, in the student
activity fund,” Brody said.

Brody said, “The idea for this presi-
dential scholarship as it is, is not a
remuneration, not a reimbursement,
not a remission, but a presidential
scholarship coming directly from the
vice chancellor for Student Affairs, Dr.
William Harmon. This does not come
from the Allocations Committee, it
does not come from SGB, it comes
from the Administration who feel that
the office of president, not Gil Golden
personally, not presidents of the past
or presidents of the future, but the
office of president should receive the
presidential scholarship.

“Half will be funded by the Office of
Student Affairs and the other half from
the remuneration fund that we never
touch nor do we see nor does the stu-

dent body see or touch,” Brody said.
“It comes from the remuneration pack-
age which other student groups
receive their remunerations from.”

According to Brody, various student
leaders of student groups receive a
remuneration for their services ren-
dered.

The SGB president, the SGB, the
CGS Student Government Council, the
CGS President, the GPSA president,
the Black Action Society, The Pitt
News, WPTS—FM, the Engineering
Student Cabinet, the Nursing Student
Association, the Academic Students for
Pharmacy, Interfraternity Council,
Panhellenic Association and various
other student groups receive remuner-
ations from the University of
Pittsburgh and not the Allocations
Committee.

“This is highest student office that
any student can attain, and with that
office of president comes a lot of

respect, but a lot of hard work,” Brody
said.

The principle is that anyﬂstudent
who wants to hold the office should
have the opportun‘ity*withoﬁt worrying
about financial responsibility, Brody
said.

Kevin Docherty, president of College
Republicans, said that if Golden had

’ any sense of what the average student

feels about this presidential scholar-
ship, he should give the money back.
This is money that could be going
anywhere in this university.

SGB. member Christopher Skutches
said, “Allocations is not and has never
been a system open to debate. It is
closed to keep the integrity of the
decisions of the committees. To open
it would prevent the committees from
doing their jobs.”

“Our board has worked hard to
maintain the‘ allocations process and
be fair to everyone,” Skutches said.

however, was only formed in
July.

“We’re doing this to stand in
solidarity with Cuba,” Bozic
said. “Four of us made an
active decision to_ get things
going, to rally around this
issue.”

“We saw the need for Cuba.
lt’s an immediate need,” she
added.

All proceeds from the event
go directly to the U.S. and
Cuba‘ Medical Project,‘ Inc.,
according to Bozic.

“It’s a group in New York
that’s doing well. In July they
delivered tons of pediatric
medical supplies to Cuba,”
Bozic said. “It is legal. I believe
they’ve been granted a second
shipment of not only medical

Thought Police

The protectors of law and order, who at the same time
seem to be-above it, are at it once again. No,we are not
speaking of the Los Angeles Police Department and its
treatment of Rodney King. This is just slightly closer to
home. Welcome to the Pittsburgh Police Department,
where its members are determined not to let their coun-
terparts on the West Coast upstage them too much.

Wednesday afternoon outside the Beehive
Coffeehouse, two employees were first beaten and then
arrested without obvious cause by two members of the
city police department. The brutality incident began
when one of the ‘employees snidely said to an officer,
for the towing away of a motorcycle, “I hope the world
treats you well.” The smart remark was immediately met
with the police officer grabbing the employee by the
neck and throwing him against the van door.

This incident is terribly frightning —- not only for the
incident itself, but also for the reminder that police ofﬁ-
cers themselves seem to be above the law. There are
too many cases of police brutality, and unfortunately
nothing is being done about it. Los Angeles, New York,
and now Pittsburgh.

But look at why this employee was beaten.. He was
brutalized for that oh-so very heinous crime of talking
back to a police officer. We are surprised that they
merely beat this man and did not stop to do something
more brutal. And since one ofﬁcer made the comment,
“there is no press,” one has to wonder since the
Pittsburgh papers have been on strike, how often these
cases of brutality occur?

Police ofﬁcers, it seems, feel that it is now their divine
right to do all that is necessary to maintain order and
keep people from saying horrid things such as “I hope
the world treats you well.”

In all seriousness, the violence itself is an extremely
disturbing act. The job of a police officer is to enforce

the law and protect citizens from that which may

infringe on one’s own health and well being. But the
only harm that was cause to the police officer, maybe,
was a slight blow to the ego. To respond with such an
act of violence as squeezing ones throat to the point
that they have difficulty breathing is inexcusable for
anyone — but especially a police officer.

It would be nice to think that these two officers would
get what they deserve — dismissal from the police
force and proper justice. The police serve a valuable
purpose in society. But they should certainly not be
above society, even though it seems as if more and
more they are. All this person did was make a smart
remark. Nothing more. To meet with that kind of

“C response is not only inexcusable, in and of itself, but it

also brings to mind George Orwell’s Thought Police
and, ironically enough, the possibility of having to live
in constant fear of the “protectors of law and order.”

SGB tuition payback benefits students

I am writing to voice my
opinion on the issue of tuition
reimbursement for the office of
Student Government Board
President. First of all, let me say
that I applaud the idea without
reservation, and I commend the
Student Government Board for
having the wisdom, foresight
and guts to instate such a poli-
cy.

According to Wednesday’s
Pitt News, several influential
and respectable campus organi-
zations do not agree. In their
opinion, we, the students,
should not have to pay for
another students tuition from
our Student Activity account.
They’ve even gone so far as to
create a new “Committee to
Rally Against Presidential
Perks.” Besides being counter-
productive to the SGB’s goals, I
feel these organizations have
completely missed the point.

Allow me to clarify the situa-
tion. It is not Gil Golden’s last
ditch effort in an attempt to
gain some sympathy for all the
long hours he’s put in. On the
contrary, it is SGB’s attempt at
resuscitating a campus which is
otherwise showing all the signs
of rigor mortis.

Is such a policy really that
outrageous? In my opinion, any
efforts to foster student involve-
ment on a campus such as this
one, where apathy is running
rampant, deserves the support
of the constituency: i.e., you
and I. »

Lets face_ it, last year’s Student
Government elections were
pitiful. Luckily, the few candi-
dates that did run were well
qualified. And how about voter
turn out? There were almost
more candidates than there

were voters. This policy could.

feasibly take care of both prob-

_ lems at once. By using the
V C money from our student activi-
' _ ty_fee, it. forcesthe students to
_ take interest in the situation. It
_ also opens the door for stu-
' dents who don’t have time for

Student Government because

they must work to pay tuition.

I find it hard to believe that
such politically active people
fail to see the wisdom in this
decision. As I have spent time
working with the SGB, I can
attest to the fact that the posi-
tion of SGB president is noth-
ing short of a full time job.
Suppose campus political orga-
nizations are the first ones to
shoot down this policy, and yet

Letters

not one of them fully spon-
sored a candidate to run for
office in the last elections?

My advice for these and other
campus organizations who are
ready to jump on the protest
bandwagon: It’s time for a big
dose of reality. You can’t get
something for nothing.

Education cry "elitist"
Mr. Silverman’s cry for “dis-

bandment” of the education

system is a fine example of its

shortcomings. To what extent

the education system is also
responsible for Mr. Silverman’s
self—centered, elitist attitudes is
difficult to asses, but his Cliff-

the illuminating impact of

Porn doesn't promote rape

Playboy contains pictures of
naked women just as Playgirl‘
displays naked men; / The - first
fact ‘may hurt Mr‘. Tajchman’s
feelings, but Tajchman has

failed to produce any evidence 

of the causal relevance of

"~35.

pornography to the incidence
of rape. The study that Mr.
Tajchman did cite is useless,
unless it contrasts the attitudes
of men who rape with those of
men who don’t rape. Find a
book that will tell you about
Mill's cannons of induction. So,
Mr. Tajchman’s article amounts
to little more than the declera-
tion —- “The pictures of naked
women hurt my feelings!” Well,
you have the right to express
yourself, but that doesn’t make
the part of your self that you’re
expressing too exciting or inter-
esting.

Toward the end of the piece
—- “  respect women. Don’t
rape women.” Let me remind
anyone concerned that most
men don’t rape women," and
those who do aren’t going to
be too attentive to Mr.
T achjman’s ministrations about
it. But don’t let that fact get in
the way of any tasty sensation
of self—righteousness attendant

upon writing this kind of heart- —

felt and brilliant prose.

Boycotting is censorship

[Regarding Porn and Men: the
naked truth (Sept. 14)]

I don’t mean to belabor a
point as important as how to
construct a logical argument,
but the author was in fact
advocating censorship while at
the same time denying doing it.
The author stated that mer-
chants stock their magazine

Welcome to the
'burgh's mallport

Leave it to Americans to expand an idea
so out of proportion that it becomes use-
less. The newest commercial craze seems
to be integrating retail shops and runways.
If there were ever two things that need not
be combined, it is these.

An article in the Sept. 15 issue of U.S.A.
Today, by Linda Dono Reeves, describes
certain airports and their plans. As
Pittsburghers eagerly await the opening of
the Midﬁeld Terminal on October first, they
cannot possibly imagine the new twist -that
is sure to surprise them.

Tim Desmond

It seems the new airport will also contain
100 retail outlets. My personal favorite has
to be Ciro — a jeweler with branches in
London, Switzerland and Beverly Hills.
Imagine how all the panic-stricken people
who desperately need to buy that $5,000
Rolex after the ﬂight will be saved.

Ihad always thought of the airport as a
temporary stop; a kind of transition
between point A and point B. Hanging
around the “mallport” after a long ﬂight has
about as much appeal as hanging around
and chatting with Dr. Fail-’em-all after a 10
hour final. L .

Pittsburgh, however, is not the only city

. with the master plan. Portland, Toronto,

New York, Denver and Atlanta are all
either opening outlet malls or building
them. Most of these airports already have
eateries or snack bars. While food in the
airport might not be a bad idea, bring your

money. Pittsburgh International has the-

same bargain prices on junk food as say,
Three Rivers Stadium. 0

Las Vegas’ McCarran International sells T-
shirts and guides to gambling. It also has
an area where you can gamble. This is
such a convenience. Instead of taking all
the time to go to all those casinos in Vegas,
you can simply lose all your money in the
airport. A typical phone call to your parents
may sound like this: “Hello Dad? Hi, it’s
your son and I lost my, my  plane ticket.
Yeah, my plane ticket! I need $3,000 wired
to the airport right away.” . '

Portland International Airport actually has
a Nike shop. I cannot tell you how many

0 times I have gotten off a flight, looked

down and realized I forgot my shoes. Face
it, if you need to buy shoes at the airport,
you probably should not be on a plane in
the first place. While some of these shops
seem ridiculous, consider this: 4S0’million
air travelers per year.. Now consider that
the estimated salary of these travelers can
exceed $100,000 per year and the picture
becomes clear — MONEY. It is quite pos-
sible that the airport malls may do well, but
do not be fooled. The shops are not to
make the life of the air traveler a more

money-hungry, corporate monster that
owns malls and sports teams is simply find-

' .ing a new way to become disgustingly

wealthy.

* pleasant one. Rather, the same type of -

One last detail about “mallports” that is I

overlooked is their location. Airports of the

Pcaliberﬁof Kennedy International or

LaGuardia do not sit in the middle of an

,Iowa corn field. These airports are usually

in close proximity to major urban centers.

1 If the Midfield Terminal was opening ‘in
Papua, ' New Guinea rather? than ,TPi.ttsburgh._
“ " j then maybe the stores could be justified. A

Perhaps it is in our blood to push every- n

. thing to the excess or maybe‘ we have a lik-

ing for expensive, useless ideas. Whatever

“ the reason, I will be happy to people-

watch at my local mall. If, however, the air-
ports stait importing big hair, my opinion
might change.

How is this not censorship? Also,
society loses an economic benefit. If
the “invisible hand” of the market-
place is not making resource alloca-
tion decisions, then a distortion has
occurred. This distortion is not _a ‘sin
tax’ such as those placed on alcohol
and tobacco, it is an-act of censor-
ship. On the other hand, a boycott
which hurts X’s owner to the point
where she must remove Playboy

from the shelves is a valid instru-
ment with which to effect a decision
on purely economic grounds.
However, this only disguises the fact
that the intent to censor has shifted
from X’s owner to the boycotters,
who have altered their economic
behaviors in order to achieve their
moral values.

The point of the preceding discus-
sion is that I have never been able to
draw a fine line between censorship
and self-censorship. They are one

and the same. One person’s
“degrading pornography” is anoth-
er’s “artistic erotica” — and who are
we to judge the difference between
obscenity and free expression?
Educating people as to what Playboy
means (itself a form of free expres-
sion) is quite different from restrict-
ing its availabilty (which is censor-
ship writ small).

Leave it to Beaver: the lie of family values

What are family values? Those two
words have become the catchphrase

‘of the 1992 presidential election. We

know what family Values are not:

Murphy Brown and Hillary Clinton,’

who won’t stay home to bake cook-
ies. And we know what family val-
ues are: George, Barbara (who is
America’s favorite grandmother) -and
their dog, Millie.

The Republican party is feeding off
the American public’s desire to
return to simple, more conventional,
and economically stable times. They
would like to see a nation full of
working dads and moms that stay
home with their 2.5 kids, a white
picket fence, a dog and a Volvo.
In other words, it would be a nation
of Cleavers . living .next to
Cunninghams. .

But guess what? That ain’t gonna
happen. In the midst of ‘its feeding
frenzy the Republican party is trying
tolswallow up and spit out the
democrats by collectively depicting
them as valueless and amoral. In
other words, its the same old story
with a different non—issue. Last time
it was flag burning, this time its fami-
ly values._ The problem here is that,

like the whole “issue” of ﬂag burn- 1

ing, family values cannot be defined
into a standard that can be integrated
and workable for an entire popula-
tion.

This is the 19905, not the 1950s.
Divorce and the single—parent family
is a common situation, and teenage
pregnancies are rampant. The tradi-
tional family unit is fast becoming a
myth and the American population is

re—defining the “American family.”
Today multi—racial, homosexual
and lesbian family units exist. Does
that make them any less of a “fami-
ly?” Are they not capable of provid-
ing the same love and care for their

Rachel Haynes

children that “normal” families pro-
vide?

In many cases, these “not normal”
families may provide more love, by
teaching their children what it means
to be tolerant of bigotry. Throughout
history, dysfunctional, or not “nor-
mal,” families have existed.
President Bush can try to define a
normal family. But he cannot have
America conform to a standard that
he feels is correct.

Does Bush think that he can lead
America back to something that it
never had? Bush can talk about fami-
ly values as much as he wants. He
and Quayle can condemn the single-
parent, and blast the working moth-
er. But what can he do to change the
family structure? There is nothing
dictated in his powers as president
that will enable him to transform
families. The only way that he can
attempt to change families is by
doing what he has been doing since
the beginning of the election cam-
paign: directing guilt at his version of
the untraditional family.

Is it .a coincidence that Vice-
President Quayle singled out the
popular sitcom Murphy Brown,
which depicts a strong, single and

independent female who has a child
out of wedlock, to label it as wrong
and un—American? Instead of trying
to help the single parent or applaud
his or her struggle the Bush adminis-
tration points ﬁngers.

A question that is bigger than fami-
ly values is the question of why this
issue is taking the spotlight in the
election campaign? The economy is
bleak, unemployment is a major
problem, and there is general dis-
content with the government. Bush
needed an issue that he could use to
relate to most of the voting popula-
tion. Family values is the issue that
he has manipulated and used to
overshadow the bigger and more
important questions — like the econ-
omy and unemployment.

So what do the voters prefer? A
grandmotherly Barbara with her hus-
band Ward (whoops, I meant
George) and their dog Millie? Or do
the voters prefer the working lawyer

. and mom, Hillary, and Bill?

But does this question really even
matter? Voter preference on presi-
dential nominee families is irrelevant.
Choosing between Barbara or Hillary
is not the way to choose family val-
ues. Voters shouldn’t look to presi-
dential candidates to find out what a
traditional family should be, instead
they should look to them for solu-
tions to the budget deficit, AIDS and
homelessness. Voters should then
look to their own families and their
own ideals and decide what kind of
traditions they want.

Students beware of the evil employer

Tuition, rent and food. These are
the three basic needs in a students

a life. In order to sustain one’s self

within the realm of academia, these
needs must be met in a fashion as to
actually induce learning and deflect
mononucleosis. As the recession hits
every corner of the economy, it is not
surprising that many students find
themselves in the grim position of
having to supplement financial aid
packages with alternative sources of
income. However, it is becoming dif-

ficult to maintain a respectable ,Q.P.A. -

and hold downra job. The solution?

Accepting a job with the university, of

course.
Most university employers tend to

" _be quite sympathetic to_the..demands

of their student employees: requiring
minimal number .of hours, allocating
time off for finals and ‘encouraging
students to hit the books when on-
the-job free time crops up. Getting
paid while still being able to study
sounds rather appealing, ‘eh? Before

you go to Hillman to apply for a
book-stacking position consider the 4

following:
A friend of mine has held a job
within the university ‘hospital system

as a receptionist. She answers
phones, does a paltry amount of ﬁl-
ing and runs photocopies. In general,
she enjoys a great deal of free time
to study or stare off into space
whilst pondering the finer aspects of
life. '

She reports to an administrative
assistant (henceforth called Cruella)
who, although having seen her 50th

Megan Heard

birthday come and go several times,
dyes her hair platinum, visits a tan-
ning bed regularly and wears enough
make-up to alarm an Avon lady, is a
stunning picture of. youth, if the truth
be told. She enjoys an active social

life, taking“three-hour...li.quid _lunch ..

breaks, frequently leaving early for
the weekend and cackling to" her

It friends in between __Sl~im-‘Past snack

bar breaks. -

Now, I ask you, for her "to be able
to do this, to whom does ‘she dele-
gate her responsibilities? As the other
secretaries already have a full work-
load and have tenure with the boss,
the work-study student is the choice.
Rest assured that when the occasional
crisis situation crops up (i.e., her hus-

band calls at four and is told that she
has yet to return from a 12:30 lun-
cheon) Cruella knows exactly whom
to scapegoat.
Although this story is horrifyingly
true, it by no means reﬂects the gen-
eral behavior of the majority of uni-
versity employers. It is meant to serve
as a cautionary tale to those of
you who are seeking employment
in order to put yourself through
school. Be sure to find out a bit about
the job before you apply for it, talk
to other students who work there
or who have worked there in the
past. t
If you do find yourself being degrad-
ed while on the job because you are
a student or feel that you are being
taken advantage of do not hesitate to
assert yourself. You cannot be fired
for voicing your ‘concerns in ,a' mature
and organized manner. ‘ , G
Above all, by accepting a job to
supplement the costs of college, be it
within or outside of the university,
you are plotting a course toward self-
cultivation. Spending the money you
earn on an educationtindicates the-
maturity and diligence which compa-
nies find appealing.

p Pitt falls to Scarlet Knights 2] -16_for second straight loss

PISCATAWAY, NJ. — Jackie
Sherrill, where are you?
After Pitt’s second straight

Big East defeat last Thursday —-

this time to Rutgers University
-—— that’s the question likely to
cross the minds of loyal
Panthers’ fans that endured the
four-hour mess of afootball
game. A few may even call for
. Foge Fazio. ,

It’s that desperate, folks. That
is the feeling when a team
loses to a team for the first time
ever. Pitt had won all nine pre-
vious meetings with the Scarlet
Knights. -

Rutgers tailback Bruce
Presley scored two second-half
touchdowns and quarterback
Brian Fortay passed for 207
yards as the Scarlet Knights
beat Pitt 21-16 before 26,017 at
Rutgers Stadium last Thursday. ’

The win improved the Scarlet

Knights’ overall record to 2-1
(1-0 in the Big East). The
Panthers dropped to 1-2 over-
all, their only win coming
against non—conference Kent.
The 1-2 start for a squad

known as a fast-starting’ football -

team is both puzzling and frus-
trating for head coach Paul
Hackett, who displayed unusu-
al bluntness and candor about
the loss_and the play of his
squad following the game.“ In
Hackett’s first two seasons at
Pitt, his teams sprinted to" 2-0
and 5-0 starts, respectively.

“I’1n very disappointed with
our start,” Hackett said. “We’ve
always been a fast-starting foot-
ball team. For some reason, not
this year.

West Virginia, now this loss —

The Pitt women’s tennis
team continued its
unbeaten streak yesterday
after it gathered an impres-

sive 6-3 win over the
Lady Griffs of Canisius_
College.

The Panthers’ record is 4-0,
with their third win coming at
St. Francis (Pa) on
Wednesday.

Sunday’s contest at the
Cost Center was possibly
to be Pitt’s most difficult

test in this early part of the
‘92 fall season. However, the
Panthers showed they
were up to the challenge by
winning four of the six singles
matches and taking two
of three in doubles competi-
tion.

No. 1 singles player
Julie LoPrinzi again set
the tone n for a Pitt victory
by defeating Jennifer Nickell
of Canisius in straight sets
(6-4, 6-3). Pitt’s Erika Devins
showed that she may
be ready to return to the
second spot after she demol-

ished Canisius’ Anne
Magaurro (6-0, 6-0). First—year
student Marla Zielinski beat
Jill Luther in No. 4 singles (6-
5, 6-3), and Josie Neiswenter
defeated her No. 6 singles
opponent, Renée Rocchio [6-
4, 6-3].

In doubles competition, the
team of LoPrinzi and Devins
made short work of Jennifer
Nickell and Lesley Broadbelt,
winning in straight sets (6-1,
6-0).

The number two doubles
tandem of Baker/Zielinski
defeated the Canisius

5, 7-5).

Pitt’s win over the Lady
Griffs comes after a trip to St.
Francis (Pa), where they shut
out the Red Flash 9-0.

The Panthers were never
challenged in this contest
as they dropped only one
set to their opponents
in singles competition and
won all three doubles match-
es. '

Singles victories were
recorded by LoPrinzi, Baker,

Women's tennis team Wins fourth in a row W/Omen/5 XC

g€tS 7”‘!/£71 07/67”

inﬁrst meet

By Jim Clark
Staff Writer

“Terrible” is how head coach
Jim Lear described the women’s

cross country team’s perfor- -
mance in its season opener at ‘

Slippery Rock University last
Saturday. “We should have
won, but we didn’t even come
close.”

Indeed. Pitt finished fifth as a
team behind Millersville,
Slippery Rock, Duquesne and
Kutztown. Lear’s remarks were
understandable considering no
Big East teams participated in
the meet and that the other
schools running were “not real
strong,” according to Lear.

The best performance from
Pitt at the meet was by senior
co-captain Carmela Mariani.
She finished fourth by posting
a time of 19:44. Two other
runners for Pitt placed in the

top 25. They were first-year

student Melanie Ishman, finish-
ing 22nd with a time of 21:14,
and senior co-captain Judy
Facey finishing 23rd with a
time of 21:15. Rounding out
Pitt’s top five runners for the
day were junior Mary Caceras
(47th, 21:58) and first—year stu-
dent Tonia, Malloy (52nd,

Red hot Pitt soccer team shocks Seton Hall 3-2

By George Klimis
Staff Writer

game
against nationally-ranked and
Big East favorite Seton Hall was
a perfect opportunity for the
Pitt soccer team to gain respect
from its conference foes.
Instead, Pitt commanded
respect, manhandling the Hall
3-2.

Pitt started off 2-0 in confer-
ence play by beating
Providence and Boston
College, and now after a major
upset over the Hall (O-3-2, 0-1
in Big East), the Panthers are a
red hot 5-0 (4-2 overall) and
atop the Big East conference.

This is a big difference from
last year’s Panther team that
finished 0-6-2 in the Big East
and picked in the preseason to
bring up the rear of the confer-
ence, according to midfielder
Eric Prex.

“Last year we had a good
team,’ but I guess we just
couldn’t get it together,” said
Prex, a sophomore. “This year
it’s just unbelievable, everyone
is just clicking.”

Prex came up big for the
Panthers scoring two goals,
including the go—ahead with
11:11 left in the- game. Being
the key man is nothing new for
Prex, who scored the winning
overtime goal against Geneva
College last Wednesday night.
He was last year’s leading scor-
er and is quickly becoming one
of the most feared players in
the Big East.

And if Prex was the big man,
than Pitt’s freshman forward
Dean Astorino was the spark
plug, getting the Panthers’ first
score late in the first half.

Astorino, who had three
shots, including a blistering 31-
yard blast which just banked

off the left post, was constantly
on the ball at both ends of the
field. He also was never reluc-
tant to attack the net, some-
thing for which Pitt will rely on
him.

“Going into this game .
there has got to be some doubt
in our minds if we would play
with Seton Hall,” a smiling
Coach Joe Luxbacher said. “But
I think after the first half it sunk
in our head that we could play
with these guys.”

“We’re the underdogs every
game — it doesn’t matter, but
this was a big, big win,” said
Luxbacher. “Any team can beat

us, /but our guys know they can .

win too.”

In the first half, Pitt
maintained a constant attack on
the Seton Hall goal, but
one too many touches inside
the Hall goal mouth caused
many of Pitt’s missed opportu-
nities.

Although Pitt out shot Seton
Hall early on, and throughout
the game 11-5, a 25-foot
shot by Seton Hall’s star for-
ward Gerson Echeverry beat
Pitt’s keeper Adam Spitzer to
the left corner 18:10 into the
first half.

'Seton Hall’s goalie Steve
Armenti came up big for the
Pirates, turning away a low
shot to the left corner by Prex.

But Pitt’s relentless offensive‘
attack never ceased. The team’s
hard work paid Off when
Astorino put Eric Duffy’s cross
from the right side of the field
past Seton Hall’s Armenti, 40:50
intothe first half. That tied the
game at halftime 1-1.

' Early in the second half,

senior forward Scott Alexander
beat Hall defender Alex
Echeverry to the goal, and
Echeverry tripped him inside
the box setting up a Pitt penal-

ty shot. Prex pushed the ball to
the left of Armenti for a 2-1
lead.

But just over a minute later, a
Pitt defender returned the favor
on a very questionable holding
call that set up a Seton Hall
penalty shot. Pirate All-Big East
forward Gerson Echeverry went
right to beat Spitzer and tie the
game at 2-2.

The Panthers’, who contin-
ued to hustle on the field,
answered back to take the lead,
this time for good with only
11:11 remaining. Alexander
passed to Prex who found the
back of the net to give Pitt a 3-
2 win.

Echeverry left the field at the
end of the game with his shirt
over his head in a sign of dis-
belief.

“It’s incredible, but it’s real,”
said Seton Hall head coach
Manny Schellscheidt about
Pitt’s turnaround in the last
year. “They deserve everything
they have accomplished so far,
and they came off the field a
deserving winner.” .

Pitt looked good throughout
the game, winning most loose
balls and constantly Clearing
their defensive zone and
attacking the Hall’s net. First-
year player J. L. Gorsin had a
superb defensive game, limiting
the offensive involvement of
the Hall’s Echeverry.

Probably the biggest differ-
ence on this Pitt team is the
first-year student. With the
goalie Spitzer and Gorsin start-

ing and Jeff Porter and Astorino

coming off the bench, Pitt has a
new look which has given the
team the boost it needed.

‘‘I’m just trying to contribute
like all the freshman, pitch in
however we can to help the
team out,” Astorino said.

Staff Writer

Any ideas that this year’s
Pitt women’s volleyball team
would be made up of noth-
ing more than an All-
America candidate and nine

other players clinging to the ~

back of her jersey were sig-
nificantly erased Saturday
night in the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse.

9 Playing most of‘ the match
without the services of
star outside hitter Ann
Marie Lucanie, the Panthers

easily defeated a scrappy but

overmatched American
University team in three
straight games 15-9, 15-5, 15-

. 9 I

» Pitt improved its record to

4-4, while

University dropped to 7-1.
.“We played a solid game,”

Pitt Coach Sue Woodstra’

said.

“I was very pleased with
the play ofour younger
players. Theygall played
well.” - ’

Although Pitt got a great
effort from Lucanie in the

‘ first game (sixkills, eight»
‘- digs), _ the f5.-foot-10-inch‘

junior and All.-American can-‘

didate was taken out of th

game by Woodstra. '
“It was completely my

decision,” Woodstra said. “I

wanted to see the other kids
play without Ann and see

.how they would perform.

They gelled very well togeth-

look at” is the Panthers’
offense, which has sputtered
and misfired inside the 30-
yard line more often than a
‘74 Pinto.

“Offensively, we don’t have
any consistency,” I‘Iackett
said. “I think, at times, we
know how to move the foot-
ball. But  as far as putting
-together a full football game,
we’re not capable of doing
that yet.” .

Despite racking up 558

A total yards against the Scarlet
Knights’ defense, Hackett’s
offense shot itself in the
foot at critical junctures of
the game — snatching a loss
from the outreaching hands
of victory. L

In the first three .quarters,
Pitt penetrated inside the
Rutgers 30-yard line six times,
but could only muster a 44-
yard field goal by kicker Sean
Conley. I _

“I’m not sure we have
much of an offense inside the
30-yard line,”’ Hackett said.
“We can’t- run the ball, the
quarterback misses passes or
throws interceptions. Our
offense inside the red zone is
in disarray.” I

Hackett singled out the
erratic play of quarterback
Alex Van Pelt as a key factor
in the inconsistent play of the

Pitt attack.

Despite throwing for 395
yards and breaking Dan
Marino’s school record for
total passing yardage, Van
Pelt threw two fourth-quarter
interceptions inside the “red
zone,” squelching prime scor-
ing opportunities for Pitt.

“I don’t know how you
cannot be displeased [with
Van Pelt’s playl,” Hackett
said. “All over the place,
were missing passes that are
wide open, we’re throwing
interceptions, we're lobbing
balls into coverage.”

“When your quarterback
plays as erratically as ours
does, the game’s going to be
in the balance.”

The game was in the bal-
ance for most of three quar-
ters, though Rutgers never
relinquished the lead after
Fortay connected with wide-
out Jim Guarantano in the
second quarter on a 33-yard
touchdown pass — staking
Rutgers to a 7-0 halftime lead.

Pitt matched score-for-score
twice in the second half -

.Van Pelt touchdown passes

following Presley touch-
downs.

Afte~r'a Van Pelt-to-Chris
Bouyer touchdown connec-
tion made it 21-16 with 2:42
remaining in the fourth, Pitt

decided to kickoff through

the endzone rather than try
an onside kick — relying on
the defense to force a punt.

“I felt there was some con-
fidence that we had in the
defense.”

The defense did force
a punt  but only after
allowing a 60-yard run by
Presley on second—and—
long. The offense got the ball

with no timeouts at the twen-

ty, but fell short on a Van Pelt
desperation pass as time
expired.

“I felt that‘ if we could get
the ball at midfield with
no timeouts, I thought we
could get in the end zone,”
Hackett said. “You have to
let '[the defense] have a
chance to win thelgame — to
stop them. [But] it wasn’t to
be.-”

Rutgersjvaulted to a 14-3
third-quarter lead courtesy
of a 58-yard TD reception
by tailback- Presley. Pitt
jumped back in the game
with the longest touchdown
pass in school history — 91
yards, Van Pelt to Dietrich
Jells. A failed two-point con-
version attempt made it 14-9,
RU.

After the defense forced a
three-and-out on Fortay’s
offense, the Pitt offense got
another chance.

Unfortunately, a 10-play, 62-

yard drive dissolved when
Van Pelt threw an intercep-
tion in the end zone. Rutgers
countered with an 80-yard
touchdown drive — the big
play a 41-yard dash by tail-
back Craig Mitter — that
ended with a two-yard
plunge by Presley for a 21-9
spread.

Mitter led the Scarlet
Knights with 108 yards rush-
ing on 16 carries.

Pitt was forced into an all-
aerial assault when tailback
Curtis Martin left the game
with a bruised Achilles ten-
don. Though Vince Williams,
Jermaine Williams and Tim
Colicchio showed flashes of
success, the Panther running
game was non-existent for
most of the night, according
to Hackett. ”

“We missed on two third-
and—ones,” Hackett said.
“That’s tough to stomach as a
running team.

“I just don’t think we run
the ball as a team.”

Martin led Pitt in rushing
with 49 yards. Vince Williams
checked in with 42 yards.

A lone bright spot for the
Pitt offense was the receiving
duo of Jells and Bouyer. Jells
had a career day with eight
catches for 184 yards. Bouyer
also had eight grabs, netting
70 yards.

we’ve gotta re-evaluate what
We’re asking him to do.”

Both of the interceptions
came at the worst possible
time: in the fourth quarter and
in the “red zone,” inside the
Rutgers 30-yard line. .

“You take away two of my

‘ stupid plays and it’s a whole

different ballgame,” Van Pelt
said. “For a fifth-year senior to
be making those errors is
ridiculous and I’ve gotta go
back and re-evaluate.”

The up side of this game
came early. Midway through
the second quarter, Van Pelt hit
Chris Bouyer on a 15-yard
crossing route and claimed the
title of Pitt’s. all—time leading

Van Pelt two records in one

. night since this was the longest

pass play in Pitt history.

“I thought the timing was real
good. They called the play in
the huddle and my eyes got
real big,” __Iells said. “I knew if
the right coverage was called
this might be a home run.”

Jells’ electrifying score
brought the Panthers to within
14-9, but Van Pelt was picked
off by linebacker Robert
Sneathen on the two-point con-
version attempt.

Just when it seemed Van Pelt
and the Panther offense was
finally clicking, miscues set
them back once again. After the
91-yard Jells bombshell, the
Panther defense quickly stuffed
Rutgers and Pitt seemingly
grabbed a wave of momentum.

Van Pelt drove Pitt from its
own 12 to the Rutgers 26 as the
third quarter expired. It was
one of the few times the
Panthers looked crisp -all sea-
son. But it was on second
down and 11 from the 16 that
Van Pelt misfired. Rolling to his

right he lofted a poor pass
toward the right corner of the
end zone. Cornerback Jay
Bellamy had Junior Green blan-
keted and easily stepped up for
the interception.

Rutgers converted this
turnover into a six-play, 80-yard
touchdown drive that apparent-
ly closed the lid on the
Panthers. But Pitt battled back
once again and had several
chances right downto the bitter
end.

After an exchange of punts,
the Panthers took over at their

i own 33, and once again, Van

Pelt marched them up field.
The entire game slipped away
on third down and five from
the Rutgers 20. Rutgers stacked
the line, showing blitz. Malik
Jackson shot up the middle and
Van Pelt escaped, but stumbled,
and lobbed a shaky pass off his
back foot. Doug Adkins
swooped in on it like a vulture
at the 15 and scampered 36
yards into Pitt territory.

Blitzing played a key role in
the Rutgers scheme all night,

with heavy pressure contribut-
ing to PittTs demise. Despite all
of his criticism, Hackett did
defend his quarterback con-
cerning’ the difficult scheme
Rutgers used.

“I don’t want to put it all on
Alex,” Hackett said. “We were
put in a tough position some of
the times there, with some of
the fronts that they did. Some
of the blitzing they did put him
in a tough position a number of
times. And that’s as much the
play call as anything else. It’s a
collective effort.

“The thing about that quarter-
back position is he’s the guy
that’s out front,” Hackett said.
“He’s the guy that everybody
sees do it, and he did not have
a good night. That’s the way it’s
been this year. We’ve had 0-for-
3 in terms. of quarterback per-

U formance in three weeks. We’ve

just gotta get better there.”

"Van Pelt dodged any talk of
the record, discounting any
comparisons to Marino.

“It doesn’t matter. Look at the
games he won,” Van Pelt said.

“He went to the Sugar Bowl
continuously. He went at least
10-2 every year. It doesn’t mat-
ter.”

He bluntly discounted the
heavy media criticism of the
Panthers while adamantly stat-
ing the Panthers gave it all they
had.

“To hell with all of them. I

' don’t give a damn about what

anyone says on the outside
world,” Van Pelt said. “We
know we’ve got a football
team. We know we’ve got a
coaching staff that’s tops. The
hell with anyone else.

"You guys may have your
own opinions. We have ours.
We’re still a hell of a football
team  We battled our asses off
tonight from the start,” Van Pelt
said.

Hackett appeared extremely
disappointed and did not try to
mask his frustration, but is
already looking ahead for Van
Pelt’s better days. .

‘‘He’ll right back to ﬁght anoth-
er day," Hackett said. "I’m sure
of that.”

THE 1’>rrr NEWS, Monday; September 21, 1992

—Wa1born

Continued from page 7
Pitt. Pitt fans were salivating
at the thrill of having “anoth-
er” Dan Marino here to light
up the scoreboard. But
“another” Dan Marino was
not born in reality. He was
born in the fantasies of fans
starving to have a winner.

The actual Marino threw for
8,597 yards at Pitt and had 79
touchdown passes throughout
his career, but more impor-
tantly he was a leader and he
won. Marino was 36-5 in his
four years at the helm of the
Panthers and led them to four
straight bowl games. He was
solid and very efficient, game-
in and game-out.

For Van Pelt the story is
very different. During the past
three seasons, his touchdown
passes fluctuated from an
amazing 17 his first year to 14
his sophomore year and to 15
in his junior season.

But while all these numbers
are good, they are still just
average. Interceptions also
ﬂuctuated for Van Pelt: throw-
ing 12 his first year to 17 the
year after, to 14 last season.
Any interceptions that attain
that double figure status in a
single season are very disap-
pointing.

Van Pelt’s stats for ‘throwing
yardage are tremendous, but
these stats do not win football
games, they just make you
look like “Heisman material”
in the program before the
game.

Stats are Alex Van Pelt. The
Pitt quarterback has tremen-
dous athletic ability but
has continually ‘come up

short when big games are
on the line. Van Pelt and
Pitt are a whopping 0-9
against the perennial Top 10
teams of Notre Dame, Miami,
Oklahoma and Penn
State.

Against these teams the
Panthers have needed good
leadership but obviously
lacked it from their quarter-
back.

A good example of stats
misleading the fans, the
media and anyone else who
reads the papers, comes from
our arch-rivals Penn State.
During the 1985 and 1986
seasons, Penn State had a no-
name quarterback by the
name of John Shaffer.

He did not have the stats
that Van Pelt has and he
never threw as many touch-
downs as our Van Pelt has.
And he definitely had no
chance of making a National
Football League team as peo-
ple say Van Pelt does.

But Shaffer quietly went 23-
1 in those two seasons and
captured a national champi-
onship in the process. No
stats, just wins.

Shaffer also had great teams
around him. The kind of
teams that Van Pelt has not
had. But talent—wise, Pitt has
had plenty of greats in the
Van Pelt years. Olanda T ruitt,
Henry Tuten, Curvin Richards,
Eric Seaman and Dave Moore
were all reliable ball handlers
that Van Pelt could count
on. -_

The offensive line has
always been an effective unit
and this year will probably be

at the top of its game.

Van Pelt has always had
time to pass, and this year
will be no different (he has
only been sacked once so far
in '92). With Chris Sestili
and Mark Livorio protecting
him, Van Pelt should stay in
the pocket as long as he
wants.

But enough with the
names, Pitt has the talent
plain and simple. As the
media puts it, Pitt only has
one player and that is Van
Pelt. The preseason gurus
write their articles and regur-
gitate the same outstanding
stats that I have already writ-
ten about

They somehow forget that
Van Pelt and company are
not winning. These stats only
make the Pitt fans hungry and
their opponents eager to
play and shut down this
“god-on—paper” of a quarter-
back.

Van Pelt has thrown for
many yards here at Pitt. Most
of his yards have come when
Pitt’s rushing attack was
churning out the yards. That
is fine and good, a balanced
attack in college football is a

necessity.
But there comes a time in
close games when the

defense stops the run and the
Big O is faced with a third
and long, passing situation.
This is when good defenses
key on the pass and good
offenses still pass on them
anyway.

Pitt has problems passing in
these vital situations. Why?

Not because the lack of talent

that "sensational first year he

around Van Pelt, but because
of Van Pelt himself.

No. 10 might be a great ‘
quarterback when he is
rolling out and dumping off
passes to his tight ends or
running backs, but when it
comes down to passing
upfield for 15 to 20 yards, he
has problems.

Van Pelt also tends to focus
on one receiver, thus
accounting for the 43 inter-
ceptions thrown over
his career. A top—notch quar-
terback not only can throw
the crucial third—and-20
ball downfield, he can look
off his primary receivers and
hit his secondary ones as
well.

Teams know this and have
continually stopped Pitt_’s run-
ning game to put Van Pelt in
those third-and-long situa-
tions.

If teams know Van Pelt is i
going to pass, they will stop
him and stop Pitt — it doesn’t
take a brain surgeon to figure
this one out.

So why has Pitt’s offensive
woes been cast aside like an
old rag? I’ll tell you: nobody
wants to blame Van Pelt after

had.

Well it is time to look past
that great season and look to
what has been a problem that
has so carefully been over-
looked or covered—up: Alex
Van Pelt.

Alex, you gave us the stats,
now give us the wins.

Writer forTbe Pitt News.

well as Andrea Passarelo
and Carrie Voda. Passarelo’s
match at No. 5 singles went
into a third set after Stacey
Spence of St. Francis won the
second set, but Passarelo
rebounded to win the match
(6-1, 3-6, 6-0).

Wins in doubles com— peti-
tion went to the teams of
LoPrinzi/Devins,
Baker/Zielinski and
Passarelo/Tammy Keister.

“This victory gave the team

a lot of confidence,” head
coach George Dieffenbach
said.

This confidence attained from
the 9-0 thrashing of St. Francis
was an integral part in Pitt’s
victory against Canisius yester-
day.

The Panthers will now try
to increase their winning
streak to five matches when
they host the Youngs-
town State Lady Penguins
today at 3 p.m. in the Cost
Center.

er. This game should be a
big confidence builder.”

Among those players who
performed very well were
first-year player Sara
Mitchell, a 5’9” outside hit-
ter, and sophomore Melanie
Gustafson, a 6” middle hitter.

Mitchell kept American off
balance with her attacks,
consistently nailing key
spikes and digging well after
long rallies late in the first
and second games. She
finished with 10 kills and
nine digs.

“I thought our team did
well,” Mitchell said.

“I still think I could’ve hit
harder though.”

Gustafson was effective
as well in her overall game.
She lead the team in kills
(13) and intimidated
American on defense, clog-
ging up the middle and forc-
ing the Eagles to dump the
ball on their attack.

Pitt got off to a slow. start
early in game one, falling
behind 3-2, but consecutive
kills by Lucanie and Mitchell
propelled Pitt on a 6-0 run.
American called time out.

The Panthers continued
their attack after the time
out, jumping out to a 14-4
lead. American fought back,
digging well and out hustling
Pitt to make the score 14-9
and forcing Pitt to use a time
out.

The Panthers quickly got

' side-out after the time out
however and finally finished K’

off the Eagles to take the
first game.
“They were a very

unorthodox team to play
against,” Woodstra said.
“They used a lot of offballs
(dinks), and that can make
it tough to play against.

‘We’re used to practicing to

get ready against teams that
hit hard, and against a team
like American, we just need-
ed to get into the flow of the
match.”

Pitt did just the opposite
early in game two. Serving
poorly and looking lethar-
gic, the Panthers fell behind
5-2.

But Pitt then took control
of the tempo, completely
shutting down the Eagles
and taking the second game,
15-5.

“We started to talk more,
and when you communicate
well, you do well,” Woodstra
said.

Pitt picked up right where
it left off in game
three, moving‘ well in
the backcourt and over-
powering American with
strong serving and good
hitting. American committed
numerous unforced errors
which Pitt capitalized on to
take the final game,"15-9.

Woodstra was happy
with the overall effort of her
team. A

 “We have excellent atti-_

tudes and “work. habits,” she
said. “Weare right where we

. want to ._be at this point in
the season?’
