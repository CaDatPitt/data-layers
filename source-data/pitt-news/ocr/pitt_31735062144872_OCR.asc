DR. NEWTON GIVES
SERMON TO SENIORS

Overhrook Pastor Preaches
On “The Religion Of
' Brotherhood”

Showing the value of aiding one’s
fellows and pointing out the diffi-
culties of effecting a world brother-
hood, Dr. Joseph F. Newton, rector
of the Memorial Church of St. Paul,
Overbrook, spoke to approximately
1,000 graduating seniors at bacca-
laureate services Sunday in Car-
negie Music Hall. He spoke on the
“Religion of Brotherhood.”

Dr. Samuel B. Linhart, secretary
of the University, read the scrip-
ture lesson, and Dr. William J. Hol-
land, former chancellor of the Uni-
versity _ and director emeritus of
Carnegie " Museum, offered the
prayer.

The Menls Glee Club sang under
the direction of Dr. W. H. Wright,
director, with John M. St. Peter, ac-
companying. Dr. Charles N. Boyd,
a graduate from the college in 1804,
was organist.

Choosing the well known parable
of the “Good Samaritan” as his
text, Dr. Newton emphasized in his
sermon the value of givingaid to
those in distress, whether ﬁnancial,
physical, mental or spiritual. Any
man, out in business only to get the
best of his "opponent, is nothing but
a bandit, he said.

“If there is to be a religion of
brotherhood, there must ﬁrst be a
brotherhood of reli ions/I’, he said,
showing. how each re igion was striv-
for the same endalthough through
differentvmediums and sometimes to
the detriment of other creeds; “Such
opposition must cease,” said Dr.
Newton,. “before world brotherhood
can be accomplished.” '

In hisparaphrase of the parable,
Dr. Newton ‘showed how the good
samaritan, although he took care of
the robbed and beaten man, did not
make the road any safer than it was
before; and that more robberies
could only be prohibited by the ex-
termination of the perpetrators. He
suggested that society go a step
further than the good samaritan ex-
ample and not only aid its unfortu-
nate victims but make the road
safe by seeking .out the “bandits”
and driving them away. One man
can not accomplish so great a feat,
nor oneecountry, but if every nation
of the world will lend a hand, the
bandits of industry, commerce and
religion will easily be disposed of,
and the religion of brotherhood will
dominate the world, he said. .

In .introd  theme... Dr...
Newton poln d out “t at the. lawyer
and Jesus wei-ein agreement as to
the general statement of ‘the. duties
of religion,-—'that the greatest com-
mandments of the law were these:
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind——and
thy neighbor as thyself.”, _But their
difference arose over the fact that
the lawyer thought Of. religion as
primarily concerned with God, as if
it could be a thing apart from.his
love- of men and a ministration to
men.

Three Attitudes Toward Human Life
. _In the discussion of the parable,
Dr. Newton distinguished three at-
titudes toward human life,—the
bandit attitude, the “blind~spot” at-

ACHIEVEMENT TESTS
SHOWED ABILITIES

Dr. Jones Says “Examinations
-Were Real Tests Of
Persons” .

 

 

The recent senior examinations
given under the supervision of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Teaching were a real
test of the ability of the persons
taking them, Dr. Walter B. Jones,
professor of research education, in
charge of -the tests, has found.

The achievement tests were given
in the early part of May to seniors
in all colleges and universities in
Pennsylvania. They included ques-
tions in all ﬁelds of knowledge, and
were designed to indicate just what
a bachelor’s degree represented in
terms of actual knowledge and in
the ability to discriminate exactly
among ideas and use them accur-
ately in thinking. The tests were
divided roughly into four parts, the
ﬁrst based on the physical science,
the second and third on social sci-
ences, languages and history, and
the fourth, on economics, industrial
technique and legal institutions and
concepts.

Using the college as a typical il-
lustration of all the schools, it was
found, for example, that of the thir-
ty-one seniors on the honor roll for
the ﬁrst semester of 1927-8, twenty,

upper-one fourth (the upper quar-
tile of the educationalists) of those
taking the senior examinations, that
twenty-four of them were above the
median of those taking the tests, and
that only one ranked in the lower
quartile of those taking the tests.
Honor Students Show Up Well.

lege, education, engineering
mines, and business administration,
three-fifths of the seniors on the
honor roll were in the upper quar-
tile of those taking the tests, and
four-ﬁfths were above the median.
From these facts, the conclusion is
drawn that tests as well as grades
measured the same types of infor-
mation, and that those students

making the best grades also made
the best marks in the senior exami-
nations.

The seniors on the honor roll for
the ﬁrst semester were those who
had quality point averages of 2.2
or better. In obtaining a student’s

PHI GAMMA DELTA
WINS SWEEPSTAKES

Kathryn Young, Elizabeth
Matthews Take Skating,
Scooter Events

A ﬁnal burst of speed that en-
abled it to hold an early lead won
for Phi Gamma Delta, national so-
cial fraternity, the University
sweepstakes for the Second succes-
sive year last Saturday in the open-
ing events of the second day of Se-
nior Week. Phi Kappa fraternity
was second and the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon entry took third place and
the third-place trophy offered for the
event.

Lester Whitmore, Col. ’30, drove

the Phi Gam entry to victory. Push-
ers on the winning team were
Charles Hyatt, Col. ’29; Lester An-
-derson, Col. ’31; Karl Klinger, Dent.
’30, and James W. Hagan, -who
shoved the car over the line to win
the‘ event in a close ﬁnish.
In the women’s events, Kathryn
Young, Col. ’28, Alpha Delta Pi fra-
ternity entry, won first place in the
roller skating event and Elizabeth
Matthews, Col. ’30, Pi Beta Phi en-
try, won the scooter race for the
second time in two years. Sigma
Pi, national social fraternity, won
the trophy offered for the best en-
try_in the annual Poverty Parade,
exhlbiting an old worn Out auto
drawn by a horse.

Fifteen entries were made in the
sweepstakes which got underway
about noon Saturday, following a
heavy rain which prevented the
events of the morning from getting
started on time. Trophies were
awarded for ﬁrst, second and third
places in the sweepstakes.

The committee in charge of the
races was John Hewitt, Bus Ad., ’28,
Pittsburgh, and Theodore‘ Biddle,
Bus. Ad., ’29, Pittsburgh.

quality poi_nt_average, each credit of
A 1s_multIpl1ed by three (a three-
cregdlt course giving nine points),
each of B by two, each of C by
One, and each of F by a minus two.
The total number of points is di-
vided by the number of credits car-
rIe_d, and the result is the quality
pomt average.

Commenting on the tests in gen-
eral, Dr_. Jones believes that they
showed Just exactly what was to be
expected In a large university such
as PItt. They showed that a stu-
dent’s grade in the test was depend-
ent. on the courses he had taken at
the University, the college students
ranking higher In general informa-
tion, and _the “technical school stu-
dents. hav1ng higher marks in the
techmcal parts of the tests. In the
college it was found, using the me-
dians for the basis of comparison,
that the grades in the four divisions
of the test vary but a few points,
showing that the typical college Stu-
dent has a broad general knowledge
of all ﬁelds of learning. In the
schools of engineering and mines the
median in part one was the highest.
The business administration school
showed the highest median in part
four, yvhile the school of education
had high medians in parts two and
three.

Will Compare Test-School Grades

An attempt is now being made,
Dr. Jones stated, to ﬁnd the rela-
tion between the grade at senior
made In any particular part of the
test with his past grades in high
school and college in the subjects
covered in that part of the test. This
survey will take into consideration

in the tests. The results will not be
available for some time, Dr. Jones
believes, although judging by the re-
lationship found in the examination
grades of the honor roll students,
the survey Wlll reveal a deﬁnite ‘cor-,
relation between the student’s
gratdes” and his knowledge of a sub-

titude, and the attitude of conscious
brotherhood.

V The second attitude is illustrated by
the acts of religious leaders them-
selves. The priest and the Levite
saw the wounded traveler, but
passed by on the other Side‘ and
gave no relief. Such men are not
always hypocrites—-they may be
blind to the real meaning of their
Own religion, said Dr. Newton. In
this connection Dr. Newton pointed
out that at the very time that Sir

the Cross of Christ I Glory,’-’-he was
an oﬂicial of the English government
and was. engaged in “forc.ing'opium
down the throats of the Chinese at
the mouth of British gunS.”'

against the idea that one should
think of America as a “Melting-pOt”
for the races in which all are to be
reduced to uniformity in thought
and belief.
no’ one is thinking. When I go into
various parts‘ of the country and see
young people doing the same things,
and hear them saying the same
things, I am suspicious.”

The true work of religion is to
‘reﬁne. men’s spirits, to cure the in-
iquities that are all too prevalent in
all affairs of human living, to make
people know their own inner and

better life. Not to ﬁnd this greatest
ofall opportunities that are open to
us in the nearness of men, in the

is indeed to miss God, said Dr.

he says,‘ fall into unconscious ar-

er, headed by More and Babbitt, is
"classical in spirit: the Middle-
Dreisfer, Mencken, Anderson, 9’Neill,
etc.-—is romantic; the Younger-
Ernest Hemingway, Cummings,
Burke, and others-—is more pre-

more intellectual” than emotional.
Other writers fall within noI,groups.-

“inﬂuencing writers.” Edna St.

 .-He» sat’ on the rocks for a long time.‘ -And‘ he didn’t think,

'‘ he watched» a greenish-pink snake twist over and "over untilit’

 down a crack in the rock. Barbon peered‘ ‘down after "it,"
 into a queer place, queerer even" than Trisca with its maples’
and palms. He heard a bell‘ ring and sawrooms’ and rooms with

;open doors, rooms, where people sat peering at watches. Then a

«man would run A" along the hall. and close one of the. doors and begin
rtalking. The. people would slide their watches into their pockets,

 either go to sleep or write words that they couldn’t read.

“Barbon knew they couldn’t read them, for he saw.other people in
"other rooms trying to decipher notes. Out -in the halls more people

 on benches. They talked about themselves and about all that

irfaa happening in the little rooms; they talkedas if they wished they

 ‘go home to bed or do something else. They never ‘looked at.
 huge stacks of books that they carried, and Barbon wondered."

 they had anything but thelrlunchea in their brief cases. Another

 everything was much the same. Barbon grew tired and wished he

Down in the shade beneath the palms and maples that waited

another shell. When he held it to his ear, the music jumbled *to-'

say, “That’s very modern!” And then he heard this voice ask one

Dr.‘I-Iolland; Speaks - .

“Fifty-four years ago,_”.-said Dr.

-Holland, in his commencement ad-

dress, ‘'1 came to Pittsblrgh with a
letter of introduction’ in I'll . pocket
to Samuel Pierpont. Lang ey, .who
then was the professor of astronomy
and physics in ‘the’ University. and
director of Allegheny Observatory.”
From that time‘ until the present
Dr. Holland has been connected with
the University and in close touch
with its leaders."

“It is with deep: emotion that I
call to mind at this hour the mem-
ory of that great and» good man, Dr.
Samuel Black McCormick,” con-
tinued Dr. Holland in his reminis-
cences,"‘whose— recent passage to the
home of ‘just men made perfect’ has
robbed this community of one whom

' blinked his _eyes, and listened again. The thing sy'nc_op.ated,.‘and'not

avail myself of this privilegefor a ,

we all loved and admired. So: you
,see I have some claim to be a link
gbetwecn the past and the present of
Qthis great school.” . T. ‘ y ’
;f in advice to those graduating he
salcl, “Remember that your are just
lucginning the, real struggle of life
i.ouay. You came to this school not
lmerely to cram‘ your minds with
ltacts but to, acquire -mental disci-
ypnnc. keep up the process.”-
I in conclusion Dr. Holland quoted
the message that his. father had
given to him when he had: taken his
son to the train‘which.was’ to carry
him to college: “Trust in the Lord
with all thy heart, in all thy ways
acknowledge Him, and I-Ieshall di-'
rect thy paths.” ‘ ‘ ~ ;

honorary insignias for freshmen co-

eds, women’s oﬁicials and various
committees are active with plans for
next fall. .

Next year as before freshmen
will become acquainted with the

a, campus under the guidance of se-

nior mentors, says Miss Helen Bat-
trick, .Y. W. C. A. secretary.

. The women’s self government as-
sociation has taken over the entire
supervision of the orientationﬁof
freshmen women ‘and approximately

-twenty-ﬁve senior women chosen by

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of wom-
en,_- on the basis of personality,
scholarship and leadership, will con-
duct weekly meetings for groups of
freshmen."

Panthers offered co-ed.a.,¢luality of
activities rather than quantity will
be the basis of the selection of the
recipients of ‘the merit awards, says
Hermine Ruoﬂ’, Col. ’31, chairman of
the committee‘ in charge.

The new method of senior men-
tors which supplants the big and
little sister project. discarded last
year because‘ of the greater harm
than good it was doing was conduct-
ed. on a small scale last fall. it
aims. to’: acquaint new girls with
school customs and‘ proper conduct
on the campus through discussion
groups and a deﬁnite course of study
based. on Jameson Lockwood’s “The
Freshman Girl,” says Miss Helen
Rush, assistant to the dean of
women; ,

_ The senior mentors will be given
intensive training by Miss Amos be-
fore‘they take charge of freshmen
groups. The plan will discover the
individual needsof the freshmen and
will be better prepared to assist tb!
new. freshmen in adjusting them-
selves to campus life, those in
charge‘ believe.

Committee Ends Work This Summer

Pittfs varsity tennis team brought
to a close its .1928 season a week
£30.. -last Saturday, with a victory

°V’~‘-1' WGSIID-mater. "This makes the ‘

fourth. consecutive victory of the sea-

two over their defeats for the sea-

the ﬁvelosses of the Panthers were
at the hands of teams which are top

serving much praise. _

With the: passing of the courts ‘on
Frick.-Acres, Doctor Stephens saw

' one of his dreams of ’msA.n!yg'yeara

mAaAAterialize.. Three tennis courts‘ have
been constructed in the. stadium, one
behind each of thegoal posts,-' and

gamed the cancellation of the open-

Ohio State suffered a similar fate.

-Nutrei Dame, 0 ening the season,
defeated . the -Pant ers in the closest
match of the season, 3-2. The ‘Pan-

matches- although they had out-
pointed the Irish in’ the singles.

'I'he_ first victory of the campaign

The Panthers journey-ed toAWash-

. 'l‘erenty-nine athletes forsook the
standards of the Blue and Gold to-
day when they received their sheep-
skins in the grand ﬁnale of their
colegiate career. The Panther ﬁnds
that ‘fourteen of his championship
football team, three members of his
memorable “Carlson Steamrollers,”
eight of his spikers, one swimmer,
and three netmen have passed on.

The loss of these men is one of
the severest blows that the Panther
has felt in years. He is optimistic,
however, for his den is full of new
material in theform of this season's
cube, and his reputation this year
should bring to his fold many ath-
letes of prep-school fame. Next
year's program will probably be one
of rcconnoitering, and the following
season will see the kill.

. So Longf Gibby‘!
We’ll Miss You

By Robert Remaley

Gilbert. “Gibby? ‘Welch, captain
and outstanding star of the varsity
football and-track: teams, has grad-
uated. With his going, the Panther
loses the greatest athlete that ever
upheld the colors of the Blue and
Gold. “Gibby” has been known about
the campus ever since his freshman
year as the driving spirit of the
teams of which he was a member.

Welch came to the University in
1924 from Bellefonte Academy with
a remarkable record as a track star
and a fair reputation as a football
player. Under the coaching of “J ock"
Sutherland, “Gibby”' has blossomed
out into one_ of the greatest half-
backs in the country and perhaps
the greatest Pitt ever had, while
Shea“ has developed him into an

lympic discus man. ' '
Gilbert Welch has played football
for four consecutive. years, three
with the varsity and one with the
freshmen, under the Blue and Gold,
developing each year until in 1926
he held the national record for the
number of yards gained during the
entire’ season, chalking up 1964
yards, and in 1927 he led a cham-
pionship team to the coast and
gained for himself the most unani-
imous choice of a position on the All-
American squad of any man since
1sRed:; :Grange. .

In track “Gibby” now holds the
University records for the javelin,
discus, and" shot‘ put, while. he is a
most formidable opponent in any
field event. He is entered for the
Olympic try-outs in Cincinnati, J une

.22 and 23, and in a preliminary

meet, the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet,
May 27, he placed third in the dis-
cus, his» specialty. .

With the passing of Welch, the
older, Welch thej youﬁger, Carlton
Welch, kid brother of the famed
“Gibby,” will come to swell the ranks
of the Gold and Blue. Carlton Welch
will come to the .University from
arkersburg High School, a former
Alma Mater of “Gibby’s,” and will
endeavor to duplicate" his big
«brother’s record. A

Twenty-Nine Pitt Athletes F orsake
Blue and Gold Sport Realm Today

Those graduating from the cham-
pionship football squad are: Cap-
tain “Gibby” Welch, Andy Salata,
Dick Booth, Chester Wasmuth, Andy
Cutler, John Roberts, Felix Demois,
Pa.ul‘Fischer, James Hagan, Walter
Hoban, Bill Kern, Phil Sargent, Dick
Goldberg and Ed Seifert.

From the “steamrollers” the uni-
versity loses Captain Sykes Reed,
Stanley Wrobleski, and John Mc-
Mahon. The swimming squad sees
the passing of Captain William

,Wright, and the netmen the losing

of Captain John O’Loughlin,' John
Lauler, and Byron Baur.

The varsity spikers lose eight man
today as a result of graduation:
Captain Welch, 'Wibecan, Long,
Hoffman, Voight, Adams, Williams,
and Brinker. -  ~
