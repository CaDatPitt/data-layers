What do these two local-11niver-
sities have that Pitt does not have?
The answer: an FM radio sta-
tion—at least not yet. There have
been attempts, struggles, but mostly
let-downs for the past eight years in
bringing an open-air FM station to
Pitt, but none successful until now.

On Monday: June 16, a license
application was submitted to the

. Federal Communications Commis-
sion where injthe next six months
the regulatory agency will review
and T approve _or reject the license
permitting Pitt to build an FM sta-
tion. .

Pittalready has an AM station,
WPGH, which can be heard on sta-
tion 64 AM,'but only if the listener
is in the Student Union, the Litch-
ﬁeld Towers, or Lothrop Hall. That
has been WPGH’s problem ever

WPGH is limited in_ its ability to
reach more radios in the area
because it is acarrier current "sta-

signals into the open airways, which *

could resultxin an FCC sanction of
up to $10,000 in fines and possible
license suspension, WPGH sends its

signals through phone lines from ,

the station’s location in the Student
Union and into transmitters in the
various campus’ ‘buildings. The
signal then goes from the transmit-
ter into electrical outlets within the
building andacan be heard on 64
AM, if the radio is plugged in.

But now there is a possibility that
WPGH will be broadcasting on the
FM dial within the next two years,
if the last of three -major hurdles is

. cleared: finding/space on the educa-

tional FM band.
The first two hurdles, getting the

funds necessary to start operation.

university administration approval,

Bush Calls Reagan  
‘Candidate for Peace’

By JANE HOLAHAN
. Pitt News Staff Writer

“Ronald Reagan is the true can-

didate for peace,” said George
Bush, the Republican vice presiden-
tial candidate, in a speech to the
Pittsburgh chapter of the World
Affairs Council Friday at the Hilton
Hotel. '
‘ Throughout his speech and the
question and answer period that
followed, Bush stressed the need for
a strong defense.

“Our best hope of persuading the
Soviets to live in peace,” according
to~Bush, “is to convince them they
can’t win in war.” L

He ‘also stressed the United
States’ need to keep its word of
honor with ‘its allies.

“Foreign policy will proceed
from strength, not simply military
strength, hut the strength of our
alliances and the reinforcement of
those alliances by America’s keep-
ing its word of honor in dealing
with other nations,” Bush said.

It’s,.basically a neighborhood place,

where you can .go-and pump Iron ‘

with Pittsburghers. There’s the
‘ usual color TV at the bar, and a
billiard table; Draft beers, and
~ drinks in general, are slightly
cheaper than in bars closer to cam-
‘pus. I ' i

The former United Nations am-
bassador began his speech by draw-
ing an analogy between today’s
world events and the beginnings of
World War II, commenting that
Western democracies made the
tragic mistake of ignoring the build

up of Hitler’s armies and may be -

doing the same thing now in deal-
ings with the Soviet Union.

This, said Bush, was demon-
strated by the Soviet Union’s inva-
sion of Afghanistan, the military

brigade in Cuba, and its attack on '

the labor strikes in Poland.

“Leaders of the Soviet Union-

don’t seek military confrontation

with the U.S.,’_’ said Bush, “but .

rather with an easy,

The danger then, according to

the state government to try to main-

_tain those levels of funding for
facilities in the City of Pittsburgh
and of course this includes the
university.

Q \ What do you mean by
“where I can try to influence?”

A) Well, talking with the state
legislators. There’s a county
delegation that represents Pitt-
sburgh and I am in touch with that
delegation from time to time about

issues connected with Pittsburgh,

funding process that are connected
with Pittsburgh, funding processes
that are.‘ connected with Western
Pennsylvania and the city, and
things of that nature. So the city of
Pittsburgh has to lobby" govern-
ment. I’ve got people working for
me in Harrsburg and in
Washington. And I've got to try to
secure funding for this city the same
as anyone else tries to secure fun-
ding for their special interest.

So, in this case here I try to lobby

for the University of Pittsburgh.

I'm sure you have people out of. the
university to do just that, to talk
with the legislators, the senators,
and the Governor, the Governor's
office—to. try to maintain the fun-
ding levels. ~ Being sympathetic

toward the unversity, Ido. the same

thing. I don't have, as you. say,
direct control over the budget.-I can
only say Pd like to see Pitt maintain
its funding level.

Q Do you think a conﬂict might
arise, as the university‘ and the sur-
rounding community begin to in-
teract more often as the university

’expands, and as it creates new

demands for facilities and the need
for space? I

A) Do I think a conflict is going
to arise? It already has. It’s been a
continuing conﬂict out there for the
last 20 years or so since Pitt and the
medical complex started to expand,
because it’s situated within a
neighborhood complex and the
neighborhood obviously felt
threatened, every time a new
building would go up, that it was
' some . of its
neighborhood. So what I initiated
was a committee composed of both
the university complex, the business
community, and_ of course the
neighborhood people themselves.

. So that when the universityedecided

they wanted to do. something, it
wasn't a surprise to the
neighborhood. The neighborhood
could work out their differences
before it got -into the confrontation
stage—-whether it be in the com-
munity, whether it be in the unversi-
ty board rooms, or whether it be
before City Council in the planning
department. Now, there are still
going to be certain conflicts.
Things that the university may want
to do that the neighborhood does

not want.‘ We have to try to be the
force in between to try to work out
those differences if at all possible. I
think in the last couple of years,
we’ve been able to do that with a
number of things. There’s a situa-
tion right now, as an example, with
a new parking garage that the
medical complex wants. And they
want to put it adjacent to, almost
continuous with, people that have
private homes up there. Obviously
they’re a little concerned and upset
about it. So we're trying to work
out maybe a design or a format that
would be acceptable ‘to both sides.
As yet, that hasn’t been able to
work out.

Q Do you think that perhaps ex- '

pansion of the University Health
Center and complex is an effort on
the part of Pitt to prove more
tangibly useful to the surrounding
community?

A) Oh, I don't know that they
have to expand to prove their use,

streets,’ our bridges, our sewer and
water, lines, things that have been
neglected over the years are very
much a part of Renaissance II. Our
recreational facilities. The keystone
to Renaissance II is the housing
programs. Now,
can't be one without people. People
go to school, people work at the
university, they work in the health
facilities. So that, in a sense, has to
be a part of Renaissance II.

The development of the universi-
ty, the development of all of
Oakland is part of Renaissance 11.

‘How can we be of help? That’s a
matter for them to come in to see us
about, or for us from time to time
to go out there and ﬁnd out what
their needs are, so that nobody is

the renaissance *5

excluded from it because it takes in J '

the entire city of Pittsburgh. And
beyond, really. Renaissance II is
just not within the 57 square miles
of what is considered Pittsburgh. It
takes up, really, Western Penn-

fPitt is now the largest employer inthe city

of Pittsburgh, above J&L Steel. So they
have proven their use, not only for what

they prooidebut for the economy of the H

city... .’

they’re already useful now. The

Health Center I think is a great
asset to" this community as well as
the university complex. They don't
have to prove themselves anymore.
The only reasonfor expansion is the
utilization of those complexes,
whether it’ be the-university itself or
the health facilities. The difficulty
again is how do you expand and
where _do you ‘expand.

Pittsburgh has been moving away

from a large industrial city to one of ' planning department to determine 1

research ‘ and development. The
university and the health facilities
are taking over where the steel in-
dustry , has been decreasing in a
number of jobs. So there is a very
definite use as I said earlier—Pitt is
now the largest employer in the city
of Pittsburgh, above J & L Steel. So
they have proven their use, not only
for what they provide but_ for the
economy of the city. So it behooves
us to try to work where we can with
the university but yet be sensitive to
the needs of the’ neighborhood
around the ‘university complex.

Q How exactly does Pitt fit into
Renaissance II ?

A) Well, let me say this: Any
facility, any activity within the City
of Pittsburgh is part of Renaissance
II in the sense that if they want to
do something, if they want to in-
itiate any new activities, programs,
projects, we're here to help. The
idea of Renaissance II was to get us
out of the doldrums of living on our
past reputation and once again
beginning to develop this city and
its neighborhoods. Most of the
glamour projects. that are happen-

- ing in the Golden Triangle are the

things you read about-. But our

effect of -what we're doing right.
here in the Golden Triangle in Pitt-
sburgh, ripples clear out to the five

_Pitts__bufgh region. A __ _
» Q ”‘What eiactly are the details
of Pitt ’s and the city ’s working rela-
tionship? How do you work
together, _ h_ow will you work
‘together?
A) Well, Pitt obviously has a

what their future plans and needs
are going to be, and they work very
closely with our own planning
department. That’s the best way.-
And through the Mavor’s Develop-
ment Committee that I have form-~
ed, any new major construction
projects that may go on goes
through this development team. It’s
"comprised of all of my agencies,
planning departments, such as ob-
visously, the planning department
itself, the’ urban redevelopment
authority, the parking authority,
economic development departments
-—any department that has anything
to do with planning or can affect
planning or has an impact on it.
When a project, whether it’s

through the -University of Pitts-Q’

burgh or whatever the project may
be, goes through this committee, we
— determine the feasibility of the pro-
ject,.and also what impact it’s going
to have on that community and on

Pittsburgh as a whole. And then we a

try to work together to make ‘it
work—not only for the people that
want to develop the project, but
also for the people who live in the
neighborhood.

So that’s the working relation-
ship we have, so that Pitt is not out
there working in a vacuum for mon-
ths or years and then come running
down here and say: ‘This is what
we want to do.’ We want to be in
on the initial stages, the initial
thoughts and ideas of what their
needs are going to be, tomorrow
and into the future, 20 years from
now. So we can begin -to set the
stage for this and to make it work.
Otherwise, you get into confronta-
tion and then there’s no discipline
in the planning. And pretty soon
you just got a helter-skelter sort of a
development going on in this city

. and nothig makes sense, and you

can’t have that. It’s a big puzzle
and everything has its place, and
you try to fit each piece into the
puzzle. Hopefully, when it’s com-
pleted—and I don’t know when it

' will ever be completed_because it’s

always ongoing—at least you can
see the picture and hopefully it’s a .
good one. _ ‘ '0

Q What about some of the pro-
blems of the urban university? For
instance, the large litter problem in
Oakland. How do you realistically '
plan to enforce the litter code?

A) I’m going to shout and yell
because I’m so frustrated with the
litter problem.’ It’s a matter of
pride. If somehow I was able‘ to put
out a resolution that said there was
going to be a moritorium on throw-
ing litter on the streets for 24 hours.
I want everybody in this city, in-
cluding the students around our
universities, not to throw litter. We,
could clean up the city within one
day, because we clean the streets
every day. And we get the mer-
chants to clean their sidewalks
everyday, that problem can be solv-
ed.
So it’s not a matter of me putting
out another 300 workers,1another
two dozen trucks, or putting more
receptacles all around the city which
‘we’re doing—the people can solve
this one themselves. How we get to
the people I have to figure out,’ and
I don’t know if anybody has. It can
be done because there are cities,
there are countries in this world
where you wouldn’t see a piece of
litter. If they can-do it, we can do
it. -
It has to start though with the

. generation that’s coming up in our

schools and our universities. My
kids wouldn’t think of throwing lit-
ter on the streets because I instill it
into their heads. Well, their kids
won’t do it either. But we don_’t
have enough of that happening. t
,It’s a small segment of our socie-
ty that litters.‘ Some people will
always litter, that’s the way they’re
always going to be. But most peo-
ple are just not aware that they’re
throwing their litter’ on-the streets,
that the streets should notbe the
recipient of their litter. And if we
can begin to get through to our
young people through the school
system—the public school system/,
the private school system, the
university complex—that’s where it
has to be done. It has to be driven
home day after day after day until
we solve the problem. It’s not the
city pickingup and emptying cans. '

We will do that if it gets into the

;ans. But I am frustrated with it

save tremendous amounts of money
in road repair that won’t be
necessary anymore if we can get the
automobile off the highway. P" So E
we’ll. make upthe difference. E And
we’ve got to get people back on that
transit system and get out of the
love affair that we have with the
American automobile. Not that
you shouldn't own one——there’s
always going to be a place for the
automobile, a place that you can__
use it. So I’m not saying that the
automobile industry is going to go
under, but there is a time and place
to use a transit system——coming in-
to'work here, going into Oakland.
So the two can be very compatible.

 :. :-.~:..} .. er!  ., 
M ‘ pient of a closed circuit Skybus, to
 respond around the hill where you
have to go to the various buildings,
all the way tothe stadium.
Mass transit, you know, when I
talked earlier about subway systems
‘A and the PATway east, is for the_en-
tirecity. People come from other
parts of the city, the county, where
have you, into the Oakland area.
But within that mass transit system
there should be a system for
Oakland itself, sort of a closed cir-
cular system because, I guess, aside
from_ downtown, there’s probably
no other community that -has as
many major facilities in it, and you
think of the Carnegie Library, the
-stadium, the university complex,
the medical complex that people go
to—all of those facilities should
somehow be connected by a transit
system. And these are things I’ve
indicated to the PORT Authority
and, of course, it’s up to them to
come up with that system.

We can provide the best system
ever, a sophisticated system, but the
only way we’re really going to get
people into_ the transit system-—even
though the‘ PORT Authority has
seen increases in ridership—is that
we’ve got to get the fare box down
to a minimum. In fact, maybe at
some point-in the future the transit
system should be free, no fee at all.
You might say ‘well Mayor, how in
the world do you make that up,
how’ is it subsidized?’ It has to be
subsidized through the federal and
state governments. You’re going to

know, we’re ready to embark upon
a subway system in the Golden
Triangle which will support an ex-
clusive busway coming from the
south, and by next year we will have
an exclusive busway going east
which will help the Oakland area,
because it’s going to penetrate parts
_ of the Oakland area.

_ Oakland has to be one of the
areas that receive the mass transit,
as does the downtown area, ‘because
aside from he Golden Triangle,
Oakland has- to be one of the busiest
areas in the cityof Pittsburgh, one
of the most active. Yet it’s concen-‘
trated in such a small area that it
makes it hard for people to get in
and out of there.

So we must sell the problem of
moving people in and out of the
Oakland complex, no matter where
they’re going, whether it’s to shop,
whether it’s. to the university,‘ to
health and medical complex-
es—whatever. And we’re in the
process of doing just that.

Q) -"Do you think it would link
everything together——aIl the institu-
tions, the building complexes... ? V

— A) Oh sure, it should, yes. And
-any new development that goes on
should have underground connec-

_ tions to it. In fact, you might even
think of Oakland as being the reci-

obviously, but I won’t give up until
we clean up the city like I know it
can be clean. _

The bulk of the city streets are
clean because the citizens keep their
streets clean. You go into places in
the Southside and you -won’t ﬁnd a

,piece of litter on the street or the
sidewalk because people out there
clean it up. It’s parts of the
downtown area, it’s obviously
Forbes and Fifth Avenue around
the university complex, that’s just
an ugly mess. ,

So if we can get those sections
cleaned up,'and we have made some
impact—it’s cleaner than it has .
been—-but not what I know it can
be. i .

Q) . Considering Pitt has approx-
imately 28,000 I commuting;
students, what are your opinions on
the future of a central mass transit
system? ’ i

A)_ Well, there’s no doubt that
we need a rapid mass transit system
in the city of Pittsburgh and we’re
finally getting _that. For years they .
discussed it, they talked‘ about it,

, they couldn’t agree on ‘a
technology, they couldn’t agree on
the route of the system and, unfor-
tunately, we lost a, lot of time and a
lot of money and effort. That can’t
deter us or stop us. As you well

point across?

A) Everywhere that I have an op-
portunity to say it, I say it, between
the PORT Authority and the coun-
ty, and the federal government
I’ve testified before the Congress at
some point. There isn’t a transit
system in this country, a major-
transit system, that makes money.
We’re all subsidized in one sense or
another. And, when they lose their
subsidies and they raise the fares,
the ridership goes down. So‘ it’s a '
sort of negative effect that goes the
other way. We’ve got to bring it
back. You just can’t keep raising ’ '
your cost and expect people to get
on the system. They’re just not ‘go-

» ing to do it.

Q) Referring to the future, what

would you urge Pitt graduates to '

Carter,” commented Bush, who
pointed to Carter’s “erratic

response” to the Soviet brigade in
Cuba, and his “sudden” reversal
on military defense.

He went on to say that the Soviet

Union is “all too aware’ of our
country’s diminished military
power.”
- After his speech, Bush answered
questions from the audience. He
spent most of this time defending
Reagan’s stand on various foreign
policy issues. ,

Bush explained in detail Reagan’s
stand on China, claiming he and
Reagan hold identical views. How-
ever, he admitted that they have not
always agreed about U.S. - Chinese
relations. . .

According to Bush, Reagan has
no objections to taking American
troops out of Taiwan, or having the
ambassador’s ﬂag moved to Pek-

V ing, two of China’s demands, but a

third—to break the neutral defense
treaty with Taiwan—is unaccep-

table. Bush pointed out that

_ Presidents Ford and Nixon also.

found his demand unacceptable.

The controversy involved in
Bush's trip was, he stated, misinter-
preted. He went on to stress that
‘both he and Reaganbelieve there is
only one China.

. When asked how Reagan would
handle the hostage crisis in Iran,

Bush first commented he was glad .

that the hostages had not been for-
gotten. He said that he did not
want to second guess the president,
but he added that the United States
should have acted right after the
World Court expressed its disap-
proval of holding American
hostages in Tehran because “we
had world opinion on our side.” ‘

Bush stated that the United States
should have moved more promptly
and that other countries must know
the United States will never bow
down to terrorists.

Bush also reaffirmed Reagan’s
opposition to a peace time draft,
saying that he is committed to in-
creasing benefits for,‘ soldiers to

strengthen the military rather than '

instituting a draft.

When asked how Bush could find
fault with Carter for an unclear
foreign policy when Reagan himself
had made anumber of inaccurate
remarks, Bush said that everyone
makes_mistakes but that Reagan at
least had apologized for his. He
then commented on Carter’s
remark in Mexico last year about
-“Montezuma’s revenge” and his
failure to apologize for it. ‘

In the final question of the after-
noon, Bush was asked to comment

on former Republican president '

Richard Nixon. Stressing that he
had nothing but disdain for Water-
gate, Bush went on to say, “He
(Nixon).has made a contribution to
peace. I think it’s time we under-
stand that.”

  FM Contingenton Negotiations with Other Stations

(Continued from page 1)

based in Duxbury, Massachusetts,
the only FM channels potentially
available to Pitt in this area are:
88.1 MHz, 88.3 MHz, and 88.7
MHz.. However, all of these fre-
quencies are impacted by WRCT,
operated by CMU on 88.3 as a
10-watt (Class __D) facility.

“The FCC has certain frequency
allocations that they make, ‘and
sometimes when they’re made in-
itially they’re made on what's called
a demand basis. That means it’s
first come first serve. They get to
keep it regardless of what frequency
they’re on,” said Edward Perry of

W sag, lg  V

      
 

Educational AM Associates.

According to Perry, this is not
the “most efficient way” to allocate
frequencies because, “one station
can tie up more channels than it
needs to.” T, .

In the case of WRCT, they are
located at 88.3 MHz, and that ties
up 88.1 through 88.7 MHz. “Basic-
ally, the conflict is that there’s
space that might potentially accom-
modate two stations, but right now
it only accommodates one and there
isn't much Pitt can doabout it,”
Perry said.

Hoping WRCT would agree to
“relinquish” their facility in favor

of Pitt, Educational FM Associates
went ahead in preparing an
engineering exhibit in 1978 to sup- 2

.port WPGH‘s application for 900 I

watts on 88.3. Engineering exhibits
are included in any FCC application
and include such data as antenna
and site information, facilities re-
quested, and potential impact _on
other stations. '

However, WRCT continued to
operate and decide‘d to increase
their power to 100 watts.

According to an informedsource .
‘ at Pitt, “an engineer on WRCT’s

executive board a_dvised.WPGH in
1978 that rather than increasing

. MHz.

WRCT’s‘ power to 100 watts» as

imandated by a recent FCC ruling,

the station (WRCT) would shut
down because of a lack of funds to
make the power increase.” .

It was with this lead that the ex
ecutive’ board of WPGH, consisting
of General Manager Jeff Couch,
Chief Engineer Ken Pierrehumbert,
Program Director Renee Pike, and
Business Manager Ric Franzi decid-
ed to go ahead -with the ‘$1,200
engineering exhibit in 1978.

But the exhibitcould not be used
and an application could not be fill-
ed by WPGH when WRCT decided
to comply with the proposed FCC
ruling. The ruling, Docket 20735
adopted in ‘June, 1978, is an overall
proposal under which various rules
changes were implemented for all
non-commercial educational FM
broadcast stations, centering on the
low-powered 10-watt FM stations
found on many college campuses.

Options Open To Pitt and CMU

The option presented to CMU by

' Pitt was the subject of a May 11,

1979, letter from past General
Manager Dan Shalenko and Media
Advisor Larry Lunsford:

“WRCT currently operates on
channel 202, 88.3 MHz. It would

i be possible to locate a new facility‘

on channel 201, 88.1 MHz if WRCT
were to move to channel 204, 88.7
Stations must be at least
three channels apart to minimize in-
terference. ”

-FCC regulations require a

currently negotiating with C U and other "radio stations in an attempt to find’ a spot on the ’“‘i“i““"“ °f f°“’ °ha““°1s betwee“

\FM. dial for WPGH.

interference of neighboring
transmissions. The letter also re-
quested that WRCT sign a waiver
of the rule that stations’ be
separated by four channels- so
WPGH could move within three
channels of ‘WRCT. ' 
Edward Perry of Educational FM .
Associates suggested another op-
tion which would benefit both radio
stations. .. —
Perry suggested finding WRCT a
frequency in the commercial band
(the band where stations are p_ermit-
ted advertising and do not have to
restrict themselves to a certain level

‘. .

of educational programming) which 5’

would allow them to continue to’
operate as a 10-watt station.

And then, Pitt would permit
WRCT to place their antenna on
top of the Cathedral of Learning,
519 feet ab_ove ground.

“That would give them greater
coverage than they’re proposing to
get now at 100 watts, and would let

‘them retain the ease of operation

that you‘ get with a ten watt
station,” Perry said. _
When upgrading to 100 watts or

more, stations assume additional 5'

responsibilities, such as regular in-
spections and ascertainment of
community needs.
f‘They could operate just as they ,

do now, except they’d reach an area
which is approximately twice as
great as they’re proposing to reach
with 100 watts,” Perry said.

Pub, 214 Oakland Ave., can prove
an enjoyable place to spend an
evening. The wildest night of the
year. at Darmy’s is St. Patrick’s
Day, when the Irish pub pours
green beer.

DECADE: The Decade's draw-
ing card is a live band every night of
the week. Most are local groups,
but last year the Decade also drew
performances from The Pretenders,
The Fabulous Poodles, and other
up and coming musicians, as well as
serving as the home base of Pitts-
burgh’s Iron City House Rockers.
Advance tickets are sold for some
shows, but generally cover is paid ‘at
the door, and often the bar is sold
out.’ The Decade is located at 233
Atwood St. _,

GUSTINE’S: Frankie Gustine’s
Restaurant is a good place to go for
a quiet evening of conversation.
Mixed drinks cost slightly more

PETER’S PUB: Peter’s, 116.‘
Oakland Ave., is the largest bar in
the area. It was remodeled and ex-

for its weekly specials which feature
q_uarter drafts. Peter's also has
mixed drinks and food.

PITT ‘TAVERN: The A Pitt
Tavern, at Fifth and Bouquet, is
another sit around and talk bar.
The decor is really kind of bland
and, the only beer they serve is
bottled. One could probably study_
in this bar, and evening school in-
structors have been known to drift
over to the place after classes for in-
formal discussions.

SANCTUARY: The Sanctuary
used to be THE Oakland disco.
Those days are gone, but it is still a
nice place to hang out and dance a

--little. More recent events at the
Sanctuary have been wet T-Shirt
contests, and this fall, the bar will
probably catch up with whatever
new craze is going around.

Food Specialty of the house is the
potato boat, a big baked potato
filled with creamy meats and

between Oakland Avenue and Bou-

onto both streets. .

SHANNON’S: Shannon’s has
the rather unique distinction of be-
ing, a restaurant with an Irish name
and ‘an Italian menu.

People Talk

. T By the Associated Press
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.—The
new Miss America, Susan Powell of
Oklahoma, described herself Sun-
day as a deeply religious person
who has never used drugs, has no
boyfriends, and considers pre-'

'marital sex “not right” for her.

The 21-year-old brunette from
Elk City, Okla., meeting with
reporters the morning after being
crowned the 54th Miss America,
likened her victory to “a wild black
stallion coming off the plains into
the -big city.”

Miss Powell, a senior vocal per-
formance major at Oklahoma City

' University, defeated 49 pageant

rivals partly on the strength of her
expressive and amusing rendition of

-“Lucy’s .Aria” with an antique

telephone.

‘-‘-I feel my greatest asset is my
singing...my voice is a gift from
God,” said Miss Powll, who hopes
to earn a ‘master’s degree and be
come an opera star.

She attributed her victory to

ew Miss America is 0

America. . ~
Miss Powell emphasized her '
smalltown, “middle—class”

background, implying that real suc-
cess has been difficult. On her of-
ficial pageant resume, for example,
she underlined that she once “chop-

- p_ed cotton.”

Yet, - Miss Powe1l’s friends in

Atlantic City said her divorced‘

parents are well=to-do, thanks to
her father's success as a landman in
Oklahoma’s booming oil and gas
industry. Her family also breeds
race horses, and Miss Powell has
had a total of 25 years of training in
piano, trumpet, voice, theater,
dance and acting.

Like her predecessor, Missis‘ssip-
pi's Cheryl Prewitt, Miss Powell
said she is a deeply religious person
who can -express “my love for
Christ through my ; singing.

, Religion ismy life,” she said. -

Asked about her presidential
preference, she replied, “I always

posed Equal Rights Amendment to

Moscow-An Ohio man who waved
a U.S. ﬂag at opening ceremonies
of the Moscow Olympic Games
tried to take anti-Soviet literature

into the country, according to the

government newspaper Izvestia.
The publication on Saturday
claimed Dan Patterson of Howard,

Ohio, arrived in Moscow last July _

“Carrying an entire library-154

volumes of ‘religious’ ‘literature-
which naturally had a strong anti-
Soviet flavor.”

, The report indicated the publica-
tions were confiscated by customs
inspectors at Moscow’s airport

Patterson could not be reached

He attracted worldwide attention
when he unfurled an American flag
during opening ceremonies July 19.
He later said he wanted to show
that some Americans disagreed with
the U.S. boycott of the Moscow
Games and said Soviet customs
authorities had noticed his ﬂag but
allowed him to take it into the

‘ -Carter, MondaIeReTst;   J    A   
GOP TickefCampaignsi

as

   

While President Carter and his
running mate took the day off,

Republican challenger Ronald‘

Reagan promised a “strong and
reliable” Social Security system
Sunday and his vice presidential

a nominee, Georgr Bush, portrayed

Reagan as “the peace candidate” of
the 1980 campaign. '
Both assertions, by Reagan and
Bush, were intended to’ counter
Democratic attacks based at least in
one instance on a-past statement by

— e the GOP presidential candidate.

The assertions served to illustrate
Reagan’s recent difficulty in shif-
ting from a posture of serf-defense
to an offensive against Carter’s
handling of the economy, which
Reagan’s advisors see as the critical
issue of the campaign. '

Carter spent most of the day at
Camp David, Md., before he
rerurend to the White House, and
Vice President Walter F. Mondale
relased at his Washington home
before returning to the campaign
trail Tuesday with an appearance in
Chicago. The president is to visit a
New Jersey steel plant the same
day.

Tuesday also is the date of "13
gubernatorial and congressional
primaries across the country,
highlighted by - a four—way
Democratic contest for the nomina-
tion to unseat Sen. Jacob K. Javits,
R-N.Y., who is seeking a fifth
Senate term.

Independent candidate John B.
Anderson, interviewed on televi-
sion, predicted he will debate Carter
and then his campaign will take off.

Reagan began a four-day cam-
paign tour in Philadelphia, where
he pledged as president to “build a
growing commitment” to the needs
of the elderly.

Speaking at a senior citizens’ rally
from the steps of the Philadelphia
Museum of Art,» Reagan sought to
offset a Carter charge last week that
he had once suggested making
Social Security voluntary.

Reagan has denied the allegation
repeatedly. He promised Sunday to
“defend the integrity _of the Social
Security system” and said it would
be “strong and reliable and pro-
tected under a Reagan administra-
tion.” .

Reagan, speaking
1964 in behalf of GOP presidential
candidate Barry M. Golgwater, had
asked rhetorically in discussing
Social Security whether it would be
possible to “introduce voluntary
features that would permit a citizen
to do better on his own...’.’

In Pennsylvania, one of several ,

major industrial states of the_ Nor-
theast and Middle‘ West that he will
visit this week, Reagan said Carter
had made a “Declaration of Indif-
ference” to the needs of
homeowners, workers, young peo-
ple and the elderly.

PHILADELPHIA—Keke
Anderson, wife of independent
presidential candidate John D.
Anderson, said Sunday that
America’s traditional two-party
system"is no.longer effective in run-
ningthe country.

Campaigning for her husband at
an outdoor senior citizens’ festival,
Mrs. Anderson said the United
States had- arrived “at a time and
place in its history when only an in-
dependent president can govern.”-

She said the election of an in-

dependent candidate “would signal.

Congress that the country is sick

and tired of the two-party fightirig,
the political supremacy. . . ’ ’

The election of her husband, she
said, would “bring to the Cabinet
Democrats, Republicans and In-
dependents, and would be very dif-
ficult for Congress to criticize the
executive branch when it’s made up
of all three. ' S

“John Anderson wants to put his
country above mere petty, party
partisanship,” Mrs. Anderson said.

-Calling her husband “a man who
speaks the truth to America,” Mrs.
Anderson said the other candidates

, were simply making, promises that
wouldn’tbe fulfilled.

She said America is in an
economic crisis and that this is’ no
time to cut taxes." -

“Anyone who tells you they’re
going to balance the budget and in-

crease defense spending is simply e

not leveling with the American peo-
ple,” she said. '
Although she _didn’t mention him

by name, Mrs. Anderson criticized‘ e
Republican Ronald Reagan’s tax—'

reduction plan.
“A 30-percent tax e ‘cut would

meann nothing to the 8 million peo- '

ple who do not have a paycheck and

would mean very little to those on » 7

the lower economic rung of the lad-
der,” she said.

Vs.‘Pitt  

No matter what views one holds about fraternities
and the Greek system, the current battle between the
university and two frats residing in university-owned

A ‘houses deserves more than, a “Who cares?” attitude

by the university community. . _
Delta Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha, two fraternities
located on N. Bellefield Avenue, have had to comply

.. with new health and saftey regulations drawn up by

the frats’ landlord—'—Pitt. These Greeks are pro-

. hibited from living or sleeping in the basements or on -
 the third floors of the houses they rent, and the total

number of residents in each house must be no fewer
than eight and no more than 14.'Since these measures

- supposedly have been implemented by the university
to insure the well-being of the residents, the restric-
tions do not seem out of line.

‘  However, another new regulation,. set forth in a
letter to Delta Phi and Pika this summer by Assistant
Vice Chancellor for Business and Finance John

Vrana, requires themonthly rent for the houses to be -
’ charged on a “per-resident_” basis. This unusual

method of determining rent, predicated on a charge
of $80 per resident, would mean that both fraternities
could pay anywhere from $640 to $1,120 on a given
month to live in the houses. Implied in such a system
is that the fraternities may decide to cut costs by urg-
ing some of their fellow frat members to seek housing

elsewhere. It is doubtful that such a scenario would ‘

take place, however; brotherhood is stressed in
fraternities. The university’s adoption of the new
rent plan undoubtedly means that Pitt, too, is aware
of fraternity brotherhood. _ '

In addition, the university plans to send personnel
to Delta Phi and Pika “no less than once a month”

to verify that both houses are abiding by Pitt’s newly ‘

set rules. The university officials will check to make
sure the number of residents in each house ranges
from eight to 14, as well as to verify that other saftey
measures arebeing' carried out. Apparently, students
who live in official campus housing should live at
Delta Phi of Pika to insure their health and saftey;
veteran residents of the Towers are hard pressed for
an answer when asked to remember the last time their
accommodations were thoroughly checked for saftey
purposes. , L \

and-ram News

Page 12—Monday, September 8, 1980

Considering the university’s position that the two
houses have aged markedly in recent years, it is
unusual that Pitt would not accept offers from the
two fraternaties to purchase the houses. Assuming
that.Delta Phi and Pika would offer fair prices for
the buildings, Pitt would be able to rid itself of two

properties that. would likely require considerable

renoyation before they could be rented to a family.
(The university considers the‘ two houses “single
family dwellings.”)

Will the Delta Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha brothers be
uprooted soon? Because the university will only grant
month-to-month leases to the fraternities, they are
constantly in limbo. That’s anything but a comfor-
ting feeling to the Delta Phis and Pikas who may
have to find alternative housing in already crowded
Oakland. ,

The fraternity system prides itself on brotherhood.
A couple of the fraternities may be on the verge of
extenction, and the future of these frats may depend
on the,degree of support and the sense of common
purpose provided by the rest of the Greek -s'ystem.
After all, another “fraternity” on campus, otherwise
known as the university adminstration, has a sense of

-brotherhood too—-a powerful, brotherhood that

always seems to have a common goal.

I’m tired of seeing silent faces
around the campus. Tomorrow,

' ' September 9, 1980, is Say Hello Day

at- Pitt. Here’s how it works: As
you’re strolling through the Towers
lobby, running down Forbes to
catch a bus, or squeezing into any
of the crowded elevators on cam-
Say it with a

in a lousy mood, pretend.

There are many acceptable sub-
stitutes for “Hello!” Any of the
following will do:

'1. Howdy—quick and to
point. — , '
‘ -'2. How ya doin’?—fast, but
familiar.

3. Good morning, afternoon, or
evening—formal, but suitable ‘for
chancellors and campus dignitaries,
ex-lovers, and others at whom

{he

you’d ,normally,. sneer.

4. How’ve you been?—veryv

familiar, demands a response,
could even lead to a conversation.

5. Bonjour—-adds a foreign
ﬂavor. '

6. Greetings—acceptable only if
you’re in a three-piece suit or tux-
edo. _ _

7. Hi!--simple and direct.

8. Aloha—shows you traveled

I this summer.

Naturally there are other suitable
greetings and salutations, any. of

— which will do the trick if uttered

sincerely with a smile. The trick is
to stick’ with it. Don’t just say hello
to familiar faces. Don’t give up
after the first hour. Say Hello Day
won’t work unless everyone sticks
with it all day. .

There will be some situations
which will require cleverness on

your part. For example, if you’re
making your way from the
Cathedral toward the Student
Union while classes are changing,
there will be a lot of people to greet.
Rather than trying to say hello to
each individually, avoid exhausting
yourself by giving one’ big
“HELLO!” every minute or so.
One large greeting can take care of
10 or 20 people.
Three hundred people saying
“Hi” quietly won’t be noticeable,
‘ but three hundred “HELLOs!” will
probably stop traffic. Perhaps
local news media will be alerted and
we’ll appear on the six o'clock
news. Imagine a ‘smiling face on

 Column/Fewer Open ‘ Parties
Will Improve Fraternity Rush

\.

By LARRY LUNSFORD

E The Interfraternity Council at
Pitt has enacted a new rule effective
this fall which will place a ‘restric-
tion on the number of open parties
that each individual fraternity
chapter may host each term. This
long overdue rule will be good for
the system.

"Undoubtedly there will be
‘opposition to the new rule from

P will be allowed to host but one par-

ty each term to which non-members
can attend. Certain fraternity men
believe that this will hurt a fraterni-
ty’s chances of gaining public ex-

‘ posure ‘and thus hurting their rush

within and without the system. To _

the fraternity chapters, the regula-

' tion means that each chapter house

effort. Others cite the money that
will be lost from the admission fees
fraternities charge non-members.
The regulation certainly will not
be met with pleasure by the non--
Greek Pitt community in that they
no longer will be able to find a
fraternity house every weekend of
the academic year where they can

go and drink to their heart’s content
for a mere dollar or two.

The biggest welcome is given the
new rule by the various neighbors in
the seven different areas in which
fraternity housing is located in
Oakland. By having all but one of
each fraternity’s parties closed to
non-members each term, the
numbers -of people attending the
parties will or should be much less.
That means a possible drop in the
noise level, fewer people to cause

damage as they leave the parties and

less of the general riffraff that
makes a’ habit of fraternity party
hopping. ‘

The biggest advantage, however,
is to each fraternity chapter. The
same advantages given to the
neighbors of the houses are also en-
joyed by the fraternities. The open
parties that have been going on in
the fraternity houses . practically
every weekend find ‘too many peo-
ple in the houses for the members to
keep under control—both on the
premises and off once the guests
depart. Some _ of these outside
guests have been causing extensive
damages to the host "fraternity
houses as well as to the properties
of fraternity neighbors. Much theft
has also been discovered at frater-
nity houses following these open
parties.

The main reason that should be
most advantageous forthe frater-
nities in the long run should be an
increase in’ rush—not the feared

- decrease. With ‘open parties, non-
members are enjoying one of the
major selling points of fraternity
membership—the social aspect-
for a very small amount of money.
They avoid the high cost of partying

in Oakland as well as the chance of

being busted by the Liquor Control
Board. With this chance to. find a

place to party so cheaply every

weekend, it’s no wonder that the
majority of these folks decide not to
pledge a single fraternity.

By closing the parties, the frater-

V nities will have to specifically plan
parties geared for the purpose of
rushing potential members. The

open parties, in some cases called
zoo parties, have become so large
that it is virtually impossible to con-
duct? any organized rush activities.
Most people are concentrating on

getting drunk and picking up a
date. No one is talking and selling

brotherhood and the other beneﬁts
of’ fraternity membership. Rush
parties should be just that and

social privileges deserve to enjoy
those activities for which they are
paying to the fullest. These

privileges can be preserved by\c1os- »

The opportunity should now
avail itself for potential members to
attend fraternity functions as in-
vited guests and hopefully the
fraternity members will have better
organized rush functions to give a
realistic picture of what fraternity

"membership is all about. Im-

mediate acceptance of the rule by
the fraternity members will enable
them to take advantage of a regula-
tion which is designed for_ their
potential benefit. Non-adherence
not only hinders an‘ individual
house but hurts the entire system
which needs total cooperation by

every group to enforce the rule and

make it successful. V

penalty area. Prior to that shot and

shot on the Akron goalkeeper. That

-. ‘Tiedtke.

Pitt played along with the very
tough Akron team in the first half
of the game looking as if the win
could possibly be the Panthers.
Akron had a few different thoughts
in mind. The Zips took 15 shots on
goal in the initial 45 minutes com-
pared to zero for the Panthers.

1

If it had not been for the superb .

play of goalkeeper Scott Thunberg
a few of those shots would have

materialized into goals. X Thunberg,‘

a junior," was given the nod for
Saturdays regular season opener
and proved that he came back for a
year of real business of guarding the
nets for Pitt. Thunberg’s improve-

ment in front of the nets was spec- l

' tacular. His performance showed

that he will be a tough person to
beat at the nets. '
Akrons first score came on an
own goal situation when a bit of a

play, a number of Zip offenders
gathered around the Pitt goal. In

head the ball out of play. Instead
of clearing the net it went in and

Akron was on the board 1-0. Joe
Pierrira was credited with the goal.

Twenty minutes went by before
the _ second Akron_ _ goa_l.
Throughout that time the Panther
defense of Don Bowen,
Hackworth, Tom Kunkel, and Tom
Trempus played superbly in war-
ding off the Akron offenders for
any further scoring.

Then at 76:18 of the game, Tony
Phillipe of Akron broke through
the lines and successfully passed off
to teammate Matt English. English
accurately placed one past the
outstretched arms of Thunberg ad-
ding another to the Akron score.
Less than a minute later Bowen and
Hackworth were called on a sand-
wich play within the penalty area
and Akron received its chance at
shooting one from twelve yards out.
Again it was English who scored for
the penalty kick and put the Zips up
by three with thirteen minutes re-
maining in the contest.

Just 37 seconds after that penalty

kick it was Phillipe "who put the ball ‘

in the nets for Akron. The ball
came from the right wing side of the
field and crossed over to hit the far
side of the ‘goal. Within a matter of

81 seconds Akron went from a 1-0 '

ball game to 4-0. Needless to say, '

the Panther momentum was broken

down.

One thing inthe Panthers favor is

towards points for the end‘ of the
season tabulation. A number of
newcomers were able to see action
in the opener and head coach Leo
Bernis had the chance to see who
should fit into what spots when Pitt
plays its home opener next Friday

b against conference foe St. Vincent.

Five days of hard practice may
prepare the Panthers to take on this

‘ next opponent. By Friday evening

most of the wrinkles should be iron-
ed out in the tactics that the Pan-
thers are using. Maybe a re-evalua-
tion of the offense that is being used
may be a beginning.

“Last year we used three people

ByThe Associated Press ,
P-ITTSBURGH—Terry Brad-
shaw plunged one yard for the tie-

breaking touchdown in the fourth‘

‘_ period, then threw a 50-yard
’ desperation scoring pass to John

- Stallworth yesterday as the Pitts-

burgh Steelers heat back a Houston

‘ rally and defeated Ken Stabler and
the Oilers 31-17 in their National
Football League opener.

The Steelers struck for 17 points
in the first period with touchdowns
coming on Bradshaw’s 29-yard pass
to Sidney Thornton and a one-yard
run by Franco Harris, who became
the NFL’s third leading al1-time

» rusher. -

But the Oilers, unable to cross
midfield in the first half, erupted
for 17 points in the third quarter.

" Their first touchdown came on an
electrifying 57-yard option pass
play from Earl Campbell—his first
pass as a pro-to Billy “White

. Shoes” Johnson. Then Campbell

2  plunged in from the one to tie it.

~‘ .'u'. -‘ .\\’.\v’.'«‘ u\.',\' -

 

But with 3:06 remaining in the 9

third period, Bradshaw began what.
turned out to be the decisive
80-yard TD drive. It took 10 plays,
including passes of 25 yards to
Stallworth, 15 to Thornton and 20'
to a leaping Lynn Swann at the
Houston two. Two plays later,
Bradshaw squirted over to put
Pittsburgh,up 24-17.

Stabler, who threw five intercep-
tions in his first regular season game
since coming \ to Houston from
Oakland, was unable to get the
Oilers going again—then Bradshaw
drove the final nail into their coffin.

On a third and 15 at midfield, he
dropped back, sprinted out of the
grasp of defensive ends Andy Dor-
ris and Jesse Baker, then unloaded
a desperation bomb toward the left
corner of the end zone. Stallworth
and cornerback Greg Stemrick,

side-by-side, leaped for the ball. _

Stallworth came down with it and
took the two steps into the end zone
for the score. ‘

Stabler, pressured all afternoon
and victimized by dropped passes as
well as the interceptions, finished
with completions on 24 of 43 at-
tempts for 196 yards, while Brad-
shaw, under heavy protection from
his line most of the time, hit on 12'
of 24 passes for 254 yards. "

Harris, who finished the game
with 46 yards on 20 carries, has
8,609 yards in this, his ninth year. It
put him past Jim Taylor's 8,597 and
leaves him behind only Jim Brown
12,312 and O.J. Simpson’ 11,236.

Campbell, carrying virtually the
entire ground game for the Oilers,
finished with 57 yards on 13 carries.-
It ended his string of seven con-
secutive 100-yard, regular season
games and left ‘him in a tie with
Simpson for the NFL record.

Bradshaw’s~TD pass to Thorn-
ton, jsut 1:44 into the game, came
three plays after Larry Anderson
ran the opening kickoff 63 yards to

      
 

‘Pittsburgh. cornerback Ron

Stabler’s first pass’ was dropped
by Campbell and his second was
picked off by Mel Blount, the first
of two by Pittsburgh’s right corner-
back. Later in the period, Brad-
shaw marched the Steelers 68 yards
in 12 plays, highlighted by his
passes of 18 yards to Stallworth and
11 to Swann, and Thornton's bursts
of 11 and 16 yards before Harris
went in from the one. _

Again Stabler went to the air, and
again Blount came away with the
ball—this time at the Houston 40.
Bradshaw and Swann teamed for a
30-yard pass play, but the Steelers
stalled and Matt Bahr kicked a
27-yard field goal.

Toni Fritsch’s 31-yard field goal
began Houston's comeback in the
third period, then came Campbell's
dazzling pass. He took the handoff
from Stabler, raced toward the
right sideline and suddenly whipped
a bullet to Johnson at the Pitts-
burgh 25. Johnson spun away from

Johnson and completed the 57-yard
play. '

Theo Bell fumbled the kick-off,
and Houston had the ball on the
Steeler 21. In six plays, Stabler
drove the Oilers to a 17-17 tie,
Campbell bulling in for the final
yard.

An interesting little booklet came in the mail the
other day. It lists anything (and everything) you’d
ever want to know about college football in the last
10 years, but were too uninterested to ask. ‘

Sometimes, it seems as though the people at the.
NCAA are just a little bored and have nothing better
to do with their time but compile statistics. When the
NCAA isn’t searching out offenders of its codes, it

Out of Bounds

By Jeff Durosko

Really though, for an avid sports fan, the booklet
is very useful. That is, if he’d like to know what ac-
tive Division III coach is the winningest in the‘ 1970s.

In addition to the ‘stats, a survey of college coaches
in all four divisions was conducted and the NCAA -
got ideas on five different aspects of college football:
the game, safety, practice, recruiting and playoffs.
Some‘, of the better reactions follow. 2 ‘ I

A pessimistic view of college football was givenby
Southern Oregon’s coach Chuck Mills who said,
“Football is under great pressure, but it won’t be
murdered. It can only commit suicide.” '

One of the biggest issues was the possibility of
‘eliminating facemasks or making them softer and
cushioning helmets. The coaches were asdifferent as
Howard Cosell and Woody Hayes on this subject.

 

the elimination of face masks. Dentists might,
though,” while Troy State’s Charlie Bradshaw felt
differently and said, “Take the face mask off and
you willhave a safer game.” ' 3 ‘
From right up Forbes Avenue, Carnegie Mellon’s
Chuck Klausing said, “In my first nine years of
coaching there were no face masks and we had one.
nose fracture in all that time. Over the next 23 years,
sincemputting on the nose bar, teams I have been
associated with average about one nose fracture per .-
year.’’ , ~
' Boots Donnelly of Middle Tennessee said, “If they
eliminated the face mask some of our pretty players
would become ugly players.”
‘ On playoffs, _ a subject which has been argued
about for years, coaches were again divided on as to
which side of the field their opinions rested. V "
Washington State’s Jim Walden said, -“Absolutely _ '
‘no playoffs—who said we need only one winner?”
Brian Colleary, the coach at Iona, a team which

statistics, specifically Pitt statistics. The Panthers are
the 36th winningest team of the 1970s because of
somefdismal seasons early in the decade. But, when
the time period is cut down to the last five years, Pitt
ranks fifth with a record of 48-11-1 since 1975. The
Panthers .rank behind Alabama, Oklahoma,
. Southern California and Central Michigan.

Pitt ‘is 23rd in scoring offense averaging 23.77
points in the last 10 years. The Panthers also rank in
total defense for the decade, 20th holding opponents
to an average of 291.1 total yards.

Attendance is another area where the NCAA keeps
extensive statistics. The top 89 schools in attendance
are listed. The list is headed by Michigan which
averaged 94,120 persons per game while Pitt is 39th
with 38,995.

Chances are" that the average Pitt student doesn’t
know that the Panthers have. played in the Rose
Bowl. ' Yep, “The Granddaddy of them All.” Pitt
was there in 1928, 1930, 1933 and 1937. The Pan- i
. thers lost all but the 1937 contest when they defeated
Washington 21-0. Now Joe Pitt knows.

Two individuals on the Pitt squad made the

A _ “Leading returning players in each category for

' l980” list.

. Quarterback Dan Marinois fourth on the list of
passing efficiency and 15th on the list of total offense
with 160.7 yards. The other Panther to make the list
is Benjie Pryor who is 16th on the receiving list.

Some other fun facts pointed out by the publica-
tion include the fact that Pitt has the second longest
current winning streat in Division I-A. Alabama
heads the list with 21 games and Pitt is second _with
10. Penn State leads all NCAA divisions in con-
secutive non-losing seasons with 41, its last losing

_ season being 1938. I

Only three teams in history have gone to a bowl
after a losing season. They are Wake Forest (last
season), Missouri (1972) and Pitt in 1973: Hugh
Green is only one of five consensus all-America
players returning in 1980.

That’s aboutall the statistics this writer can handle
and the same can probably be said for the reader. In-
cidentally, for those fanatics out ‘there, the winn-
ingest coach in Division III football in the 1970s is
Dave Maurer of Wittenberg college. So what? Close
behind in second place is neighbor CMU’s Klausing.

By The Associated Press
The Houston Oilers huffed and
But the door that
Coach Bum Phillips talked about
refused to budge again yesterday.

Phillips had vowed to kick the
door in this season after losing
twice to Pittsburgh in the playoffs.
And he was asked if the door was as
solid as ever after Terry Bradshaw
and the Steelers engineered a,3l-l7
victory. I

“I don’t know how to answer
that. I’ll answer that when we get
to Houston,” ‘said Phillips, sitting
on a blue locker. “Y’all kind of
caught me off guard. I didn’t have
my losing speech prepared.”

1.-

Steeler defensive tackle Joe

Greene refused to get drawn into S

the door game too.

“I’ll bet Bum wishes he never
said that,” Greene smiled. “We
don’t talk about it and I haven’t
heaTd~anyone over there talk about
it since the championship game.
That’s a hot potato that's being
passed around between you guys
who don’t block and tackle.”

Oiler emotions ebbed and ﬂowed
greatly Sunday. Houston staged a
furious, 17-point rally in the third
period after failing to cross midfield
in the first half. But Bradshaw

'~capped an 80-yard drive with a oIie- ,
yard plunge, then floated a 50-yard"-

touchdown to John Stallworth on a

“That was a killer there, in more
ways than one,” said Oiler tight end
Mike Barber.

But to a man, the Oilers showed
no dismay at having failed to dent
the steel door standing between
them and the Super Bowl.

“We know in our hearts we can
beat Pittsburgh. In my opinion, it’s
just a loss,” said Barber.

Cornerback Greg Stemrick, who
tipped the ball before Stallworth
hauled in the touchdown, con-
curred.

“They know for a fact we're not
going to give up. They got to play
-us in Houston. This game is over.

You cannot dwell on it,” Stemrick
said.‘

“You just got to get up. You
can’t give up,” said running back
Earl Campbell, whose first pass in
his three-year career went 57 yards
for an Oiler touchdown.

“It’s one game. There's 15 to
go,” added Phillips, angry at more
than a half dozen »Ken Stabler
passes that Oiler receivers dropped.

“It would have made a whole lot

.of difference if we could have hung

onto the ball," the Houston coach
added.

Late in the third quarter, Phillips
electedlto punt from the Houston
45 on a third-and-inches situation.
But the Steelers marched right back
for the 80-yard drive that broke the
tie.

“The odds are just better when
you go on and punt the football and
not take the chance of really giving
the ball game away,” Phillips said.

Phillips also gave the Steelers
their due.

“They're a great football team.
They don’t have any weaknesses. If
they do, we haven’t discovered

them or we haven’t exploited them, ,

one or the other,” he said.

Pittsburgh Will Afford Students A
Good Opportunity in the Next Ten Years

/Continued from Page 3)
do? would you urge them to stay
here in Pittsburgh?

A) Stay here in Pittsburgh—ab-
solutely. Now obviously, all of
them can’t stay or depending on
your field of endeavor, I don’t
know what’s here. But what I’m
saying is that you have ‘a strong
community, you have one of the
more liveable communities in this
country. You have a strong cor-
porate community, the third largest
in the country, the second largest in
the revenues that these corporations
gen_erate. A lot of them are interna-
tional. If I were a student, I would
first give Pittsburgh an opportunity
to provide that student with some
place to settle. You have a strong
academic and health community if
you’re in that field.

So before you graduate, anyone
who graduates here, I would cer-
tainly give Pittsburgh a chance.
Obviously, if you exhaust the
means of trying to find something
here, then alright, you move on.
But I think Pittsburgh is going to
afford students a" good opportunity.
We’re becoming a strong research

and development community for .

engineers. Some of the things that
are coming down the pike from
Washington—synfue1s and things
like that—Pittsburgh is trying to get
out front very quickly. So the ex-
pansion of that will grow. There
are other things that are beginning

‘to grow in Pittsburgh.

So these next 10 years are going
to_be very exciting years in Pitts-
burgh. And if you’re in on the
ground floor, you can certainly ap-
preciate it by getting a job, but also
by being excited about it and doing
something that you might enjoy be-
ing a part. _

Q) As an ex officio member of
Pitt ’s board of trustees, and also as
the mayor of Pittsburgh, do you I
ever encounter conflicts of in-
terest——like when you make deci-
sions concerning CMU or Du-
quesne or one of the other private

f colleges?

A) Well, that’s bound to hap-
pen. They have me on so many

-boards, ex officio member, and

sure, from time to time there can be
conflict. A board of ‘trustees may
see a project one way, but as mayor
of the city, I’ve got to look not only
at the university, but I’ve got.to be

~ responsible for the entire city. And

that is always going to be foremost
in my mind.
First I’m the mayor, second I’m a

trustee of all these various univer-
sities and hospitals and things of
that nature. But when I find myself
in conflict, I just remove myself
from that issue and I act as the
mayor. Because what’s good for
the entire city will ultimately be

‘ good for the university. Some may

not see it that way, but at least I
think it’s that way.

Q) As long-time resident of Pitts-
burgh, how have your perceptions
of Pitt changed as you ’ve become
older? For instance, how did you
react during the late sixties when the
protests were going on?

A) Well I think Pitt.’ s growing up
quite a bit—not only the people

that work there, but the students’

themselves. T here’s a way of get-
ting a message across, changing
issues, changing the way our society
works. And it doesn’t have to be
through violent confrontation at
all. \.

During the first few years of my
term here, there were neighborhood

organizations that were run bv nn_t-'
' side professional people, and their

theory was: confrontation was the
only way you get something. Well
they found out very quickly, not in

my administration, and I literally
threw them out of the office.
Because my door is open. There’s.
no need for confrontation. There’s
no need to yell and scream and
come here and insist, because I
don’t have a magic wand. As long-
as I am sincerely trying, my ad-
ministration is sincerely trying, and
the overall record is one for the city,
then you don’t need confrontation.
I think that ‘whatever issue it might
be, you must take a look at: what
does the university represent

overall? There may be certain ,

isolated issues that you may take‘
issue with and so you make your
voice heard—it should be that way.
One thing we whould never do is to
try to isolate or silence the voice of
our students, our college students.
Because I find more and more that

you can provide this -city,‘ our soc1e- V

ty, with a lot of good thoughts,
ideas, recommendations that we.
should be very much aware of an_d

'to use those things. But it«doesn’t

have to be through extreme con-
frontation.

Q) If there was one thing you
could recommend to a freshman
entering Pitt, what would that be? .
