Fraternity Men

Form Society

An organization ‘of the national
fraternity men attending Pitt, whose
fraternities are not represented" here,
has recently been formed. These men,
come
from other colleges, have taken this
step for the welfare of this Universi-
ty. One of their chief aiins is to in-
crease the school spirit at Pitt. This
they ‘WOul’_l like to do by encouraging
a more friendly, relationship between
the various fraternities. * They also
desire to give their assistance and ad-
vice, provided it is properly received,
to the local °fraternities who are peti-
tioning national chapters. This or-
ganization, because of the experience
and inﬂuence of its members, can ac-
complish much and should be sup-
ported by the students.' The faculty
heartily endorses the action taken by
these men. ~ ’

night, November 28th, when the an-

nual joint’ Pitt-State concert is held",

in Carnegie Music Hall. Those hold
and _Blue musicians, both mandol-in
and glee clubmen, numbering about
‘80 men, have put-in several in-terest-
ing rehearsals during the past two
weeks, and are fast rounding into
concert form under the direction of
J.»w. Cratty and H. P. ‘Ashe, a for-
mer“ Pitt gleeman. Within the next
two weeks both clubs will be in read-
iness to give a most pleasing enter-
tainment consisting of new and lively

“. songs and instrumental selections ap-

propriate to college life. .

The men are pulling hard for old
Uni, and realize that with the large
Mandolin and Glee" Clubs of Penn
State as their opponents on the stage
they will have to sing with all that is
in them-to gain the favor and loyalty
of the many friends, students and
alumni of both institutions that will
turn out by the hundreds .that night.
Penn State College will bring over

. forty men with them this year in-
- both clubs to participate in this big

annualmusical entertainment, which
is easily the most important college
musical function of the year. Re-
ports from the Blue and Wlhite col-
lege indicate that their clubs are of
rare musical _merit this year, they
having held two very successful con-
certs thus far. ‘

During the next three Weeks both
Pitt ‘clubs will gather twice a "week
for rehearsals so that additional num-
bers may -be learned, as well as the
regular numbers be given considera-
ble brushing ﬂip. A few men who
have been absent during the last two
weeks are to be considered as non-
candidates for these organizations, it

' being necessary to draw this string-
ent measurc unless every practice is
attended: “ I .

Tickets for this concert will be
‘placed on sale next week in the book
store and in the hands of many of
the members of both these organiza-
tions for the advance sale. These
tickets may be exchanged on and after
November 23rd at Hamilton’s Music

Store, Wood" street, but it is essential «

that you buy early, since the Penn
State men have asked for a large res-
ervation. Tickets for the concert will
range from _50 cents to $1.00.
Dance.tickets will also be sold————
though only a few .may be accommo-

clubs, so it is

CERELE FRANCAIS
‘ HOLDS MEETING

 

The initial meeting of‘th'e Cercle
Francais was held in.room 403 Thaw
Hall, 10:30 Monday morning. Many
important plans for the coming year
were discussed. The society is going
to make this year a land mark for all
its future history.

Owing to the diﬁiculties in scouring ‘

a time for meeting it was’ suggested
to h3_Id evening meetings. These will
consist of lectures both in French
and about French for the ﬁrst half of
the meeting, and an enioyable social
to complete the entertainment. The
ﬁrst lecture will be an illustrated re-
view of the City of Paris, which will
be given in Thaw Hall at 10:30 Mon-

day morning within the next few
weeks. .
A- program committee was ap-

pointed consisting of Dr. Harry, Miss
Moldenhauer and Mr. Bier.
The meeting had a large attend-

ance, and everybody who is anxious "

to get into the spirit of French in any
line is earnestly invited to join.

GOOD SPEAKERS
. FOR COLLEGE

 

Prof. Gibbs has engaged several
good speakers for future college as-
semblies.‘ On next Wednesday, J.
Byron Beacon," the new secretary of
the Associated Charities of Pitts-
burgh, will address the students. His
‘subject has notyet been announced,
but‘ from available reports the stu-
dents will be given a rare treat. An-
other notable speaker to address the
students in the near future is Mr.
Webster, City Ornitholog»ist.- The
latter’s lecture is illustrated by many
interesting slides, and promises to be
very instructive and entertaining.

With such men as the above two to
address them the students should all
strive to attend Assembly Wednesday
mornings and make use of the oppor-
tunity as well as show their appre-
ciation for the speaker. ‘ .

"Mr. .Knowles, representative of the
University to the Twentieth Century

the student assembly last” Friday
morning, spoke of his western trip,
describing the different important
events of the Congress.

“It may seem odd,” ‘he said, “that
we should have sent a delegate to an
Irrigationv‘ Congress. But there the
ﬂood question was broughtup and
this is a problem which is attracting,
the attention of all those interested

burgh. For this reason  was sent to
Salt Lake City. M

“On our waywestward we stopped
at Denver and gave that beautiful.
city a hasty visit. From here we
made no stop until we reached the
goal of our mission.

“Here... the first day was spent in
t'he Mormon Cathedral, discussing
many vital problems with which the
western cities are confronted.’On the
following days we visited other large
assembly rooms where the same line
of work was conducted.”

The assembly ‘was ‘concluded with

pr. M. c. A. MEETING -

The  M. C. A-. meeting ‘in ’{Thaw

Hall chapel Monday mor'ning_ , was

addressed by Mr. Lyman H. Pierce,
Pit-tsburgh Commissioner of Y.“ M. C,
,A.’s, and Mr. Edward’ Lockwood, an-
other well-known .worker_. 0]. ‘G-.

‘Quick, presidentof the College Asso-_'
ciation, presided.

Mr. Pierce gave the students a
meaty address, mentioning some of
the lines alongwhich college  M.
C. A.imen can work. He showed the’

necessity for an association, because.

there are. some Christian men in
every college who’ should band_to-
gether, and the religious life of the

college must not be‘under denoniina-_

tional control, even ima denomina-
tional... school. A college ‘association

‘ in a large city has the advantage of

nearness tothe citywassociation with
its well-developed organization. The
college m.an,’however; usually joins
the Y. M. C. A. from a sense of duty
and for the service ‘he can give, rather
than for the membership privileges
which a city association affords.
Among the mahy opportunities for
service which Mr. Pierce’ tpuched
upon.is thework. of getting hold -of
prospective students before they
come to tlieollniversity, the fall cam-
paign after school opens—meeting
new men at the stations, making

them feel at home, dispelling that‘

feeling,’ ’ and otherwise 0‘
aiding them to get their bearings— j
needy stu- A

“lonesome

ﬁnding employment for

dents,’ etc. Then there is the relig-

ious work, for "the association is pri— '

marily a Ch tian Association. In

this regard Mr. Pierce spoke of the‘ 

increasingly large number of students
in" Bible study classes. The social
life of the students is, of course, im,-‘
portant, but the. thing that
claim their attention aboveall others
is social service, and the place the
college student should occupy in the
life ‘bf the coinmunity. Playground
work, po r
visiting the associated charities,
immigrant and negro problem, and

all ‘sorts of Y. M. C. A. work are M

only different phases of the great
‘social service movement.
an impossible dream, said Mr. Pierce,
that Pitt may soon have its own Y.

that he will ever be anything but‘ a 1

life. He urged every student to get

tions have been held at the same time
on :1 certain day, so that the student
that would have othe wise been ' at

‘both meetings_was compelled to take

his choice of the two. A little fore-
thought by the men that got up the
meetingswould have made it possible
for the student to have been present.
at both gatherings. -

The same ,thing,ap'plies to the sale
of the sjeudent activity books.’ It
seemsso farithat the managers of the

, student activities that'the book'rep-'

resents areinot pushing thesale of it
in as systematic a’ manner as they
might, and that they are rather trying
to. push the sale of their own indi-
vidual activity with a great deal more
energy. This is foolish in the ex-
treme. Much more good can be ac-

complished f-or each individual organ-

ization, as well as for 'the University
at large, by all the managers getting
together and pushing the sale_ of the
student activity books. Theserbooks
are a bargain to the students, and the
students. should have every opportun-
ity to _proﬁt, even if each individual
organization’ in the University has to
cut down its rates a little: It will
pay in the end. ‘

A committee has been appointed to
help along the various activities of
the University, and it is up to the
managers of these organizations to
come to the committee from time to
time _and get suggestions as to how to
solve all thevexing problems that
they may run up against. This com-
,mittee*has ‘the interests of the entire
University at heart and will be only
too willing to help out at an ytime, to
the extent of their ability, in problems
of common interest. ’

STOCK GoI1_\fG UP

'Since the game:with ‘the. Notre
Dame team on last‘ Saturday, the
chances of the Blue and Gold in the
big games of the year have gone up
over one hundred per cent. Those
members of the student body -that
had become pessimists by the con‘-
tinual reverses of the team since the
start of -the season have changed
their’ tune and are now*very conﬁ-
dent that the rest of the season is go-
ing to produce some of the ‘greatest
football struggles that have everbeen
played on any gridiron; those that
have always been optimists, evenf 
the face cf facts that were any thing
but of an encoura_ging~nature, are all
smiles and areiunable to see anything-
but victory for the Pitt warriors from
now on. In short, the change that
has been wrought by the great game
that Pitt played against the team
from Indiana has been almost mirac-
ulous, and has put new life into
every loyal follower of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. . - i

Football, like baseball, is one of
-the most uncertain sports that ‘is’
known.” Therecanlbe no better proof
of the fact than the game of last
week. 1 ‘A most discouragin“g's'easori

Gold, w'hil.3‘iNotre Dame had enjoyed
one of the'b'est_ seasons in‘ the history
of the University, and were claiming
that they would be the,real cham-
pions of the West. T‘hey“~came to
Pittsburgh willing to wage! their last
cent that they would simply smother
our gridiron heroes, ascore of not
less than 30-0 being the aim of the
visitors.’ However, the dppe all went
wrong, and they were more than glad
to quit a held with a 3-0 victory that
came very close (a few inches) to
being a tie game. Vi/how shall arise to

‘venturean opinion as to the‘ outcome

of, the rest of the games this season?
Not the Pitt VWeekly.i‘ But we will
say that in one week the Pitt foot-’
ball squad by a great exhibition of
football has caused all its friends to

to bring the,ichampionship, of West-.

has "rested for the last three years.

ATTENDANCE AT ASSEMBLIES

Many complaints have been ﬁled by
the students to the Pitt Weekly con-
cerning t'hc new requirements that
have recently been issued from head-
quarters to the effect. that every stu-
dent ‘must attend the exercises that
areﬂheld in Memorial Hall every Fri-

tion: '

“It was just as I had expected from
the ﬁrst. Thege was never a question
in my mind as tour the outcome of the
election. The great plurality that Mr.
VVilson received indicates the c.o1iﬁ—
dence that the American people have
in his ability to make good, ‘and to

bauchery. *1 look for four years of

SIDE LINES

 

With the exception of Captain Galvin
and Hockensmith, the Pitt players
are all in splendid condition and will
give a good account of themselves
from now on_.

“Polly” will not play against Mary-
land, but will be saved for the W.i&
If and State contests. His injured
arm is all right now_ and he will do
light work all this week. ”

“Dutch” Hockensmith is‘ still in
bed as a resiilt of the Navy-game two
weeks ago. He received 'a dislocation
of the knee early in the game and to
add “insult to injury” ‘was taken with
tonsilitis the day he arrived in Pitts-
burgh from the Annapolis trip. He
will not play for the Gold and Blue
again this season.

Billy McEllroy has recovered from
the attack of grip that has kept him
out of practice for othe past week or
so. He will get in ‘the .Maryland
game. . '

,Shapira did very well at center
against Notre Dame, which made up
for the reversal of form he showed at
Annapolis. He will hold down the
center position to-morrow.

the game up to a certain extent. A
game is oftenispoiled by officials be-
ing t0_o'technical in theirhrulings, and
this seemed ‘to be theacase last Satur-
day.

The most pleasing part of the game
to the Pitt boosters was the sterling
game played by Shof, who was placed
at quarter by Coach Joe Thompson.
One of the greatestitroiiblesithis year
has been the lack of ‘a reliable'piv'ota1
man and it looks as though the prob-
lem is at last solved. McEllroy has
not been. -in the best of shape this
season on account of training for

FEW IMPORTANT GAMES‘-
-SCHEDULED TO-MORROW

South and East Will Clash When
Harvard Meéts Van'derbiIt—Ind.'ians
Will Meet Strong Army Team——_
State and W.. & J. Should Win.

0

 

The game which will be most in
the « limelight next Saturday is the
clash between Harvard and the Van-
derbilt team at Cambridge. Vander-
bilt has the greatest team" of their
history this year, as they have .de—
featgd the best'teams in the South by
large scores and their‘ goal line has
not been crossed since the season
opened. ‘ -They won from 511' oppo-
nents last year until they’ bucked‘ the
Michigan team and were forced to
taste defeat,‘ 9-8. The Vanderbilt
team is said to be light,but very fast
and it will be brawn against speed
next Saturday when they meet Har-
vard. The Crimson team ‘showed-a
lot of strength in their game with
Princeton principally through the ﬁne
playing of Brickley. who" negotiated
three ﬁeld goals and tore the Orange
and Black,;line to shreds. He was in-
jured in this game andpwill probably
grace -the sidelines in the Vanderbilt
contest which may slow the Harvard
machine up to a certain extent, but
at.~that the Crimson eleven _should
win‘ byseveral touchdowns. V

The Army’ team is ‘said to have a
very strong ﬁfense this seasonand
they sure will need it to-morrovw
when Jim Thorpe and his husky gang
invade West Point. No
succeeded in stopping Thorpe, Arcasa
and Welsh this year excepting W. &
I., and the Army defense will have
their hands full if they do so. How-
ever the Indian team is. due’ fora
slumpabout ‘now and it may appear
in the next game. They are very un-
certain players and,-it is very difﬁcult
to dope out just how they will per-
form at «any time. ' ~ '

Wash. -& Jeff; meets 'Western Re-
serve" at W'ashington to-morrow, and
while the latter team has shown class
this year, we look to see them de-
feated with points to spare. ,They
played Navy a good game following
Pitt, bu-t lost by a score of 7-0.

Penn State should have a cinch
with Villa Nova and will probably use
this team to prepare for Ohio State,

when they meet on the 16th at Co- »

lumbus. This game will not be an
easy onepfor State as the Ohio eleven
is strongerth-is year than usual and
will give the Cente; County aggre-
gation a stiff argument. ’ '

His chief trouble lay in the fact that
he lacked aggressiveness, but Coach
Thompson has, at last managed to put
a lot of ﬁght into the big fellow and
he will give all his opponents-trouble

Hoag did well‘ at the other tackle and

Hube Wagner played a star game
again arid will‘ be the man most feared
by W. & ‘J. and State. He has been
able to gain against all the lines he
has bucked this year and it is doubt-
ful either of the above teams will
be able to stop Pitt’s speedy fullback.
The Notre Dame coach remarked

after the game that Wagner has some-«

thing on Eichenlaub, which is quite a
tribute in itself. Dillon played a good
game at half and will hold down this
berth for the r,est of the season, he
was unfortunate in fumbling several
punts but they were recovered by one
of the other -Pitt backs each time.‘
“Steve” seems to have the goods when
it comes to open ﬁeld running and if

. he can overcome his tendency to fum-

ble punts will‘be a great asset to the
team.‘ Ward, Corboy and Kernohan
played the other half in turn and all
showed up well, particularly the latter

score in the last quarter when he
passed the balltaccurately to Reese

Leahy went -into t'he game with a sore
arm but both he and “Cupid” Smith
escaped unscathed from the fray.
Several times in the game they drop-
ped Messrs. Eichgnlaub, Pliska, Dorias

.& Co. for losses and played a bang

up game from start to finish. With
Capt. Galvin‘ in the lineup, Pitt will
have one of the strongest center trios
in ‘the country. I Shapira took Gal-
vin’s place at center against Notre
Dame and played a fast aggressive
game. He will have to surrender his
place to Polly after tomorrow’s game
and will be held in reserve with Blair.

THE POINT OF VIEW

 

Pitt has beaten W. & J. decisively
for the past -three years, but have we
“rubbed it in?” 'VVell, not exactly.
They havegalways proven worthy op-
ponents and the V\Ieekly has never up
to this year said anything that could
be construed as a knock at W. & J.,
their team, or the spirit exhibited at
our annual game. In our descriptions
of the game, editorials, etc., only the
best traits of our nearby rivals have
been mentioned; we have dwelt on
what a game showing they have made
and on how the wearers of‘ the Red
and Black have stuck with the team
till the ﬁnish and showed good spirit
in the face of -defeat.

This year the VV. & J. followers
think that they are sure to win and
one can note the change that has
taken place in their weekly, “The
Red and Black.” They think they
will win and consequently are “run-
ning down” t'he Pitt team as much as
possible. One
ticles from 'under a heading which

should be called “Rave-ings” -instead I

of “Ravellings” is as follows:

“A coincidence-Galvin was put out
of the Pitt—Indian game last year for
slugging. He was so badly disabled
in the same game this year that he
has‘ not been able to play since. In
the previous issue they inferred that
the Pitt team was yellow.”

The game this year is not yet de- ‘ 

ci-ded, and on the 16th we expect to
again ‘have a small goat bedecked in
Red and Black. .-

 

PUBLIC SPEAKING TEACHER

' ADDRESSES COLLEGE CHAPEL

 

The college chafpel Wednesday was
again in charge of the faculty. Prof.
F. H. Lane of the Public Speaking
Department‘ gave a ‘very amusing
reading of the wooing scene from
Henry V. The broken attempts of
Katherine to express herself in Eng-
lish, and the equally ludicrous efforts
of King Harry. to speak respectable
French were admirably read by Prof.
Lane. '

THE LYCEUM

 

“Life’s Shop Window,” which will be
seen at the Lyceum Theater next
week, is said to be just the sort of
play to please a sympathetic spec.-

whole affair, the beautiful wild
plunges of the playwright into these
depths where souls are tried, where
the problems of life are grappled with
until they are solved, ase suﬂficient en-
vironments to make quiteundeniable

$20,000. In L-1871 Mr. Thaw made an
offer of $100,000 toward the 'perma,-
nanet ‘endowment of the Un-ivers-ity,
on con-dition that a like amount
should be contributecl by the citizens
of Pittsburgh, and this fund was com-
pleted in 1875. Other movements in
more recent years‘ are familiar,
through which the University was
mofe fully‘ equipped for its work. '
The time has come, however, ‘when,
since it is doing the'same ‘work the»
larger universities of the countr.y are
doing, it must ‘have a larger equip-
mentof buildings and endowment.
When the -fund of $3,000,000 has been
completed the university will‘ be put
upon.a foundation of pciwer and of ex-
cellence, insuring a career of enlarged
usefulness. Additional buildings have
become an imperative necessity.' Their
erection can no longer be deferred, as
the student body has‘ overcrowded the
present capacity. VVith the comple-
tion of this fund these pressing needs
will be served, and the western part
of the great commonwealth‘ will have
