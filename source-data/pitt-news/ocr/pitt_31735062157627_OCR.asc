Committee

  Completes

The eUniversit,'y’s Committee on Educational Exchange hgs com-
pleted formulating plans to aid students and faculty members seek-
ing information in regards to study abroad, according to, Dr. Sam-

of the committee.

' uel’ P. Franklin, dean of the School of Education, who is chairman

Chosen in the fall of 1948 by Chancellor Rufus, Fitzgerald, the
committee has four main purposes. They are:

1. To further opportunities fore

faculty members and both gradu-
ate and undergraduate students
for study abroad;

2. To eﬁect a wise'selection of
foreign students for admission to
the university;

3. To develop ﬁles on educa-
tional institutions abroad, organ-
izations which oﬁer exchange fel-
lowships, and on government reg-
ulations regarding study abroad;

4. To suggest to schools of the
university the development of
courses and curriculum along in-
ternational lines. ~ ‘

Serving with Dr. Franklin on
the committee are Mrs. Ruth C.
Mitchell, head of the Nationality
Rooms, as executive secretary; J.
G. Quick, head of the Registrar’s
Office, as secretary, and a number
of other administrative officers and
faculty members of the university,

To aid in arousing interest in
this program, the committee plans
to have distinguished speakers
from foreign countries,'and stu-
dents who have studied in for-
eign countries address the student
body. The ﬁrst speaker will be
Dr. Elizabeth Waelti, visiting pro-
fessor in modern languages from
Switzerland who will speak on
Jan. 13. Time and place of this
-first address will be announced
later. '

Class cards for students en-
tering new courses in the
Spring semester will be avail-
able on Monday in the Com-
monsgltoom. Students are re-
quested to refrain from re-
questing cards from the vari-
ous departmtnts ‘before Mon-

, day. NO cards will begiven out

 

 
 

Check Credits
Seniors Told

Thursday is the deadline for
February graduates’ grades, which
means that they should have
checked their balance sheet in the
college oﬁice for credits and ﬁeld
pr_e-requisites.

June graduates should begin
now to have appointments with
their deans to check their bal-
ance sheet. Too often a senior is
unable to graduate because he has

failed to take the proper amount
of creditsor the proper subjects
for his ﬁeld.

The various schools have stu-
dent records available for check-
ing. To insure graduation seniors
should begin now to check their
balance sheets.

Several hundred Pitt advanced
ROTC students received a late
visit‘*from Santa Claus this week
when they were handed a raise
in subsistence.

The cadet pay is now 90 cents a
day, an increase of 11 cents over
the former rate. But the best news

is retroactive to July 1, 1948, and

the cadets found with their De-
cember checks a back pay draft
averaging $16.00.

\The pay increase was made by
order of the Secretary of Defense
and will make the average month-
ly checks read $27.00 or $28.00.

The ROTC checks are paid to all
regularly enrolled advanced mili-
tary science students for the days
they actually attend class. The
pay is the same amount as the fur-
lough rations which servicemen
remember were paid to GPS while
on leave. The commutation in lieu
of rations used to be about 65
cents per day. Now it is 90 cents.

—AnvisoRs AT LAST

* Student Congress is currently at work on a program to
provide faculty advice for University students. That doesn’t
sound like such a-‘revolutionary idea, and indeed, it isn’t.

  

, Up until the deluge of students swamped the University
after the late _war, it was the customary thing for faculty
imembers to advise students in their choice of courses and aid
them in overcomingthe difficulties common to any person sud-
denly thrust into a different sort of life.  I

7-smariii 1114 iii

\

V Unfortunately, the sudden ‘swelling of the University
population made such a couiiselling program impractical. There
were too many students and too little time for the faculty.

VVhat the Student Congress has in mind is probably coun-
selling on a much smallerscale than that which went on prior
to 1945. But ,any kind of a program which will bring the stu-

 

gz eseg--3i.{,51 ‘L £1-enuep ‘A.‘epi.1,.1

permit the students to receivethte beneﬁt of experienced advice,
can ’t help but be of great beneﬁt to the students.

So far the arrangements have proceeded to the conference
‘stage with representatives of Congress and the faculty discuss-
in"g_the matter. First reports are encouraging. The faculty seems
notonly willing, but‘ very eager, to revive the advisor. system

»  some form.

 

It can’t come too soon. Right now- students have the feel-

ing (and not without cause) that they are caught in some

sort of an academic assembly line which picks them up as fresh-

.men and carries them through school, turning them out as

, “graduates with a diploma. Personal contact with the men and
womenfwho teach them is almost unknown.

 

If that personal contact can be restored the University
will have gone quitepa way toward returning to its "role of an

educational‘ institution. 4

iCrossvvord Puzzle  

   

 

The other day somebody asked
me what was the purpose of this
column. In the ﬁrst place it was
none of his business but when he
pummeled me to the ground ‘and
was kicking the living be-jaybers
out of me, I reversed my former
attitude and with all of the smug-
ness and aloofness which one can
muster while having his nosed
rubbed in the concrete, I explain-
ed the situation.

3

“My good man,” I breathed, “the ,

purpose of this column is to ﬁll’

space.”
He appeared satisﬁed with this

because he poked me a parting,

and\walked oﬁ down the street.

To the above incident there is
no moral, no inference, no noth-
ing; I just thought you’d like to
hear obout it.

punch, ‘sort of a one-to—grow-on.f

But now on to the sermon for’

today. I went to a cocktail party
_‘the other nigh-t. I scrubbed my

to-see-the-dead—suit. I arrived at
the door '4 with my. . invitation
clutched in my grubby digets and
had all of the outward appearances
of ‘the college ,bred Amale in the
social whirl. But as the party
progressed-‘I saw that my Uni-ver-

these thin stems of culture and
grace. ' 8 ,
Out of This World I _ ,

The whole of the aristocratic
conversations‘ was built around
modern art, books of the month,‘
traveling to little arty colonies in
New Englandand what the ﬁrst
nighters were saying about Broad-
way’s latest. If I tried once I tried
on numerous occasions to inject
gmy -sparkling ' personality and
witty patter‘ into the various con-
versations going on about me. I
refused to ‘be silenced but the
gathered gentry observed me from
the bridge of theirlong thin noses
as somewhat of 23 dull number.

A fear ﬁlled my breast-when.I
realized that if these people didn’t
care -for my company I probably
wouldn’t 'be invited to any more
of these functions and to be.‘re—
jected from all future free booze
events wasa’ situation not to be
considered lightly.

' I" tied to recall things which I
‘had heard in class. I ran up to a

small group which was discussing

the political Views of a current
Broadway hit. I reached into my
reserve of knowledge from Polit-
ical Science 2 and recited the Pre-
able to the Constitution;"undaunt-
ed. I recited it backwards, then
offered to wrestle anyone in the
house. They didn‘t bat an eye-
lash. So I did a soft shoe shuffle
toward the_ punch—bow1 while re-
citing every third line of the Get-
tysburg Address with an intermit-
tant list of presidents since Mon-
roe. It was a ﬂop‘. , .
Down on Hands and Knees
They looked at. me with min-
gled emotions of understanding
and pity, sort of thetlook that lov-
ing parents reserve for their
addled children. I remained un-_
daunted. I ran madly toward an-
other group proclaiming that I
knew how to use a slide rule.

luckily I just happened to have

my slide rule with me. Nobody
was interested. I got down on all
fours and“ took a piece. of chalk
from my pocket, I just happened
to have a piece of chalk with me,
and with my hunk of chalk I car-
ried “pi” to the thirtenth place on
thekitchen linoleum. There was a
polite smattering of applause but
still their eyes werecoldand dis-
tant, there was no friendship. De-
jected, I put on my coat and ma-
roon tam and went out into the
winter streets.

Moral of the story:. There
should be a course here. at the
University called, Cocktail 102.
The object of this class would be
to teach the college st'udent how
to act at a cocktail party. The
cocktail party in recent years has
become the most important single
event in the histories of many
men. Business acquaintances’ are
made, deals are signed, sealed,
and delivered. Nations are made
and broken while all that the col-

.,[’ette.». to
Editor,» Pitt News: ‘
iAs is well known to most people
‘ admittance to
medical schools is extremely diffi-
cult. Competitionbis keen and the
places available are few. Thus, it
1S absolutely essential, in" most 2
cases, for a pre-medical student to
spend much time, effort and money
in ﬁlling out applications and in
securing the other material re-
quired by the medical schools.
One (of the speciﬁc demands of
most medical colleges is that the
applicant have the registrar of his.
university forward, post-haste, _a
transcript of all his grades, so that
evaluation of the application will
not be‘ delayed. In fact, tardiness
in the receipt of the transcript can
easily invalidate an _«application..
Now, for the hundreds of pre-
meds at Pitt, the registrar’s oﬂice
will magnanimously send out, a
transcript toiany medical college’

upon receipt of a request, and the
payment of one dollar. These
transcripts are.,'su‘pposed to be sent
out within ten days. I, for one,
naively accepted the word’ of the
registrar's mptlyl for-

in a university,

     
 
  

  

ismilingly consoled me that, “'1_‘here‘
are a lot of others in the same

transcripts 8

script had not been received. Quite

angry with the apparent deception. -

of the school oﬂicials, I rushed to

the ofﬁce and inquired about 
matter. The woman in charge
said it was true that my traIi- .

scripts had" not gone out, but she

boat.” i Frankly, I was ﬁlled with

indignation, and I’m sure my‘:

“shipmates” .would’ have ‘felt the

same. My grades were iﬁnal1_;y'.‘sent,

out that week, nearly six‘ weeks
after therequest. ‘

The whole situation, it seems:

to me, is a» deplorable one, and

one ,which‘ ‘needs immediate: im- I

provement. The registrar’s otlice
should not give out false informa-
tion upon which students “must-

rely. If they can’t get the tran-

scripts out within tendays,‘ ‘more
people should be hired to do 

  

 

  

in early December I learned -frornl .
_.one medical school that my rtran-fit

work. After all, they charge ‘one

dollar for each transcript. At?
rate, the pre-meds deserve an ‘

planation. They “expect anyt I,
but‘ a stab in the back from: .

Enrollment Up

To 20.000

Going against predictions seems
to be Pitt’s style.

Pitt’s total fall registration ﬁg-
ures, according to the registrar’s
office, are the largest ever at this
university. A total of 20,571 stu-
dents, of which 51 per cent are
veterans, make up this enroll-
ment. This is an all around in-
crease of 453 students.

Men students still outnumber
women students at Pitt three to
one, about the reverse of what it
was during 1944-1945.

According to Olson there have
been no standout performers in
the array, but the quarter-mile
combinations are bent on bring-
ing to Pitt a few mile-relay
trophys from the early spring
meets.

Final arrangements have not
been made for the opening indoor

Olson’s proteges wil be in Wash-

Other possible mile events on
the indoor agenda are a meet in
Philadelphia, sponsored by the
Philadelphia Inquirer, the Boston

IC4A’s, which come late next
month.

Olson also hopes to take the
team to Cleveland for the Knights

Panthéiénated
Over Allegheny
Saturday Night

By MYRON KOPELMAN

Basketball fans who like their
ﬁeld goals looped in from 45 feet
out had better stay away from to-
morrow night’s Stadium presen-
tation between Pitt and Allegheny.
‘ On the other hand, those who
appreciate a scientiﬁc bal1-weav-
ing exhibition culminating in a
driving lay-up shot, may have a
pleasant evening. The game
stacks up as a battle of the bunny.

Both teams depend out of ne-
cessity on close-in shots for their
points.

A1legheny’s dependence is due
to its lack of a player who can
shoot from afar. Pitt boasts set-
shot artist Sammy David, but
when Sammy misses there are no
Panthers around who are big
enough to retrieve the rebound.

The win-conscious Pitts, with
their carefully calculated ﬁgure-

drive through to the hoop more
than their opponents, however.
Only once in four starts have the
Gators won this season.

. Lack of height is one big reason
why Allegheny does not appear
tough. A 6-4 center, Bill Potter,
is the only long man on the vis-
iting team, and as basketball cen-

eight system of play, ﬁgure to

ters go nowadays, Potter is a
shorty.

Allegheny’s lack of height is
not expected to tempt Pitt into
trying a set shot attack. Even in
trouncing Miami U, 80-48, the
Panthers did very little outside
arching. I

The star of the Allegheny cast
is Co-captain Paul (Easy) Miller,
a speedy 5-11 forward. He ranks
among the Tri—State district’s
leading scorers.

As a shooter of. set shots Miller
is nothing to rave about, but he

‘spells trouble when he is on the

scoring end of a fast break, Coach
Al Werner’s oﬁensive forte.

If Pitt stops the break, it should
win its ﬁfth in a row.

Tomorow night’s prelim, start-
ing at 7:15, shows the Pitt J ayvees
against the Educators, a strong in-
tramural ﬁve.

Pitt’s continuity cagers, regulat-

Wednesday night.

Despite a Plaid rally in the ﬁnal
minutes of the game, the Pan-

the Skibo hardwood.

Toeing the foul line occupied
much of the basketeers’ time. The

However, Pitt’s Sammy David

After First Victory At Allegheny

While the Allegheny basketball ﬁve ‘tangles with the red-hot

swimming team, travels to the Gators’ Meadville campus to pay

a return engagement.

Fenn College, always a strong
foe, will offer the ﬁrst real test
for Pitt in the home opener Jan.
19.

can call upon Captain Paul Brug-
ger and Dick Petro to spearhead
the free—style sprinters. On hand
to back them up are Don Wilde
and Ed Bruener, while Mike Le-
vine and Walt Jackson are top
distance free—sty1ers.

Petro recently set a 150-yard
individual medley record in a
junior AAU meet at the YMHA.

Best bet as 3 winner in his spe-
cialty is Bill Manko, ace back-
stroker, who owns a victory skein
of ten in a row, covering two years
of dual meet competition.

In the breaststroke event, last
year’s,number.one and two men,
Bob McHale and Harry Lucas re-
turn, bolstering the bright outlook
in the Saturday opener.

Diving will be out at Allegheny
due to the lack of a board, but
diver Bill Cochran will double as
a backstroker. However, another
diver, Howard Sadowsky, will
have to wait for the meet at Edin-
boro next week to see action.

lead is Jack Doyle, Theta Chi ace,
with 32 points. Behind Doyle
is little Don Letizia with 31 points.
