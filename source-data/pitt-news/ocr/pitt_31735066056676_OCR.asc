Brody challenges

SGB candidates to

refocus platforms  

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

In less than two months
from now, the 1994 Student
Government Board will take
office.

Jacob Brody, president of
1993’s board, expressed hope
that the new officers will
bring some "new ideas with
them. '

Citing board and presiden-
Tial candidates’ references’ to
public safety as a central
issue, Brody said the candi-
dates must take a new direc-
tion withtheir platforms.

“We need to-move away
from the issues we’ve seen the
last couple of elections,”
Brody said. “We need to see
some new ideas.”

Brody said while issues
such as public safety and

A communication are “impor-

tant” candidates should take
other student concerns into
account when ycomposing
their platforms.

“I’m sort of disappointed to
see 14 board candidates
come out and keep talking
about safety,” Brody said.
“There’s no need, in my opin-
ion, for someone to try to
change everything that’s

‘ going on.”

“He or she can work with
the Safety Committee and say,
‘I have some new ideas for
safety. How can we work on
this?” he added.

However, SGB Safety
Committee Chair Derek
Majikas said only four candi-
dates have discussed safety
concerns with him.

“lCandidatesl keep saying
‘safety, safety, safety,” Majikas
said, “but, I’m the safety com-
mittee chairperson_and not
many people have come and
talked to me about it.”

Brody advised students to
look for originality in candi-
dates’ platforms when they

vote on Nov. 17.

“I’m asking the students 
to look for those candidates
with new issues,” he said.
“Don’t look for the same old
rehashing of safety and com-
munication.”

“There are all kinds of prob-
lems,” Brody added. “I’m
challenging [the candidates] to
find those problems.” _

Brody also commented on
last week’s public safety semi-
nar, which only four people
attended. He said he was “dis—
heartened” by the turnout,
since safety has been fre-
quently discussed during this
year’s campaign.

“Four people going just
shows a lack of interest on the
students’ part of how to make
themselves more aware of
problems facing our campus,"
he said.

' Brody said -SGB’ will -contin-
ue sponsoring safety semi-
nars, “but we’re not going to
baby—sit you and carry you by
the hand to these events.”

Board Member Tom Grassia
said candidates should
research problems before
including them in their plat-
forms. According to Grassia,
one board candidate dis-
cussed starting a committee to
identify poor performance by
Pitt professors while SGB’s
Academic Affairs Committee
has been doing the same
thing over the past year.

“This is an example of
board candidates and even, in
some instances, presidential
candidates running without
actually checking what’s
being done and that’s pretty
sad,” Grassia said.

In other SGB activity, Board
Member Joe Foner said a new
computer survey program will
begin operation soon. Foner
said a test run of the
Computerized Survey
Initiative will take place in

Due to crowded parking con-
ditions, some students find park-
ing as difﬁcult as they find some
of their classes. To solve this
problem, Pitt’s Department of
Parking and Transportation has
recently created 200 parking
spaces available for Pitt graduate
students.

The Biotech lot will host day-

New parking openfor grad students

time parking for graduate stu-
dents. The Graduate and
Professional Students
Association has been working
with Student Government Board
member Tony Moody to provide
parking for graduate students.
“The parking office is being very
cooperative with us and the SGB
to set up whatever we need,”
GPSA President Steve Parks said.

Graduate student parking is
one of several student issues that

GPSA has been working on late-
ly, and according to Parks, the
results are positive.

A spot in the Biotech lot will
cost students $40 a month, but it
will “pay for itself in the long
run,” Parks said. “If you get three
tickets, it adds up to at least that

much.” In addition to helping .

True—life story informs CWO members about breast cancer

By Randy Knapick
Staff‘ Writer

Self breast examinations and aware-

ness are the best weapons against breast ‘

cancer, according to Susan Harkins, who
spoke at Thursday’s Campus Women’s
Organization meeting.

Harkins, who experienced the tragedy
of breast cancer two—and-a—half years
ago, said “breast cancer right now is at
epidemic proportions.”

Harkins said 180,000 women will
develop breast cancer in the next year

and 46,000 of those Women will die.

She compared those statistics with the
American involvememt in Vietnam",
where 57,000 soldiers lost their lives.

Over the same period of time, she said
350,000 women died of breast cancer.

Those women are not all older
women, the group typically associated
with breast cancer.

“Breast cancer  was thought to be an
old woman’s disease,” she said.
“[Victimsl are getting younger and
younger.”

Just as breast cancer is no longer con-

sidered a disease of the old, it is no
longer taboo to discuss openly.

“Twenty years ago we whispered
about it,” she said. “My generation was

the first to start shouting about it.” 9

“The bad news is that there is no "pre-
vention and there is no cure,” she said.

However, if detected early enough,
“most people can go on to live a long,
healthy life,” she said.

Because of surgical advances, Harkins
said, “many, many women do not have
to lose a breast.”

Using “breast preservation” tech-

niques, surgeons remove the cancerous
tumor and radiate the rest of the breast.
This procedure has the same survival
rate as a traditional masectomy.

Harkins said women should begin
doing monthly self breast examinations
at age 22.

Some breast lumps are normal,
Harkins said, and through regular exami-
nations, women will recognize new
lumps “which should not be there.”

Eighty percent of all breast cancers are
found by the woman or her partner, she

Unable to practice, band changes halftime show

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

A last minute paint job of the
lines on the Pitt Stadium ﬁeld
wiped out the Pitt marching
band’s practice time last week,
causing a cancellation of their
scheduled halftime show at the
Pitt—Miami football game on
Saturday. ‘

Instead of performing the

show, the band marched
around the track leaving many
of the fans in attendance con-
fused.
__,“The band sounded good, but
I like to see marching and danc-
ing in a show,” Chris Jackson
said. “The ﬁeld was completely
empty and no one knew why.”

According to marching band
director Dr. O’Neill Sanford, the
band was not permitted to prac-
tice in Pitt Stadium since
Monday and most members did
not feel confident performing a
show they had barely practiced.
Pitt Athletic Department
spokesperson Larry Eldridge
had no comment.

“If you are going to perform a
program in front of 30,000 peo-
ple, you should feel comfort-

able,” Sanford said.

“We had only practiced two
hours compared to our regular
14, but we still wanted to enter-
tain people at halftime. Playing
to people from the track was
the best we could do at that
point.”

Sanford said that before half-
time, the band reached a con-
sensus on that day’s perfor-
mance.

“We voted to not perform the
show,” band member Danielle
Elias said. “I didn’t feel pre-
pared, and I can’t perform with-
out being prepared.”

According to Sanford,

this incident and other recent I

setbacks have left some
band members frustrated
with the administration at
Pitt.

“It’s unfair; everyone else has
some sort of facilities. We were
sent to practice on the tennis
courts at the Cost Center,” band
member Lorna Ertle said.

“We had to put down mask-
ing tape for yard lines and some
of the courts were being used
while we practiced.”

Sanford said when he
showed up for practice
Thursday evening, he was told
by Pitt’s facilities coordinator
that the ﬁeld was being painted
and could not be used by
the band that night.‘ Friday
he learned that the field
was still being painted and
lines would also be put down
in the Cost center for the band
practice that evening. When
he showed up at the Cost
Center and no lines were
there, the band was forced to
mark the field with masking
tape.

According to Sanford,
the band was counting
on Thursday, Friday and

Saturday practices due to a soc-
cer game in ‘the stadium on
Tuesday. When they were
prevented from using the stadi-
um Saturday morning and

cheerleaders were using the

Cost center, several band mem-

bers were left extremely unhap-
PY-

“The band goes to all kinds of
functions to represent Pitt on
very short notice, yet we don’t
even have a band room,” Carrie
McManus said.

“The stadium is the only
place we have to practice and
meet.”

According to Danielle Elias,
the athletic department has little
respect for its biggest support-
ers. _

“On Saturday, it seemed like
half of the student section was
rooting for Miami,” Elias said.
“We are at every game for the
entire game and support Pitt.
We do it because we enjoy it,
but it takes some the fun out of
band when it seems like the
athletic department doesn’t
care.” I

An announcement by the ath-
letic department last ,week
dashed hopes fora band facility
within Pitt Stadium, according
to drum major Alex Alspach.

Slovak Festival sbowcasesfooa’, dance, clothing and culture

Byjohn B. Moore
For The Pitt News

I The Gothic architecture of the
Cathedral of Learning commons
room served as backdrop to the
Third Annual Slovak Heritage
Festival yesterday afternoon.

The University Slavic
Department, home to the only
permanent Slovak Studies
Program in the United States,
hosted the festival which gave
the public a taste of Slovak cul-
ture, crafts and food.

Among those in attendance at
the first festival since Slovakia’s
independence was Helene
Cincebeaux, director of the

A Slovak Heritage and Folklore
Society International. Cince-
beaux, of Rochester, N.Y., said
she comes to the festivals in
Pittsburgh because “people here
just seem so responsive to what
we have to share.”

Dressed in the traditional
Slovak bridal outﬁt, a dress made
of embroidered linen with pleats
hand—creased with the fingernail,
Cincebeaux said that “a lot of
people think that the Slovak
immigrants who came here were

ignorant people, but they
weren’t. They came from a beau-
tiful country and made beautiful
things, like their clothing.”

Also at the festival was Greg
Smith from the Historical Society
of Western Pennsyl—vania. In
1995, the Historical Society will
open the Pittsburgh Regional
History Center in the Strip
District. Smith said, “Pittsburgh
has been a center for the Slovak
people for a long time, and
we’re here to make sure that
they’re represented in our
Regional Center.”

The Historical Society was also
asking for donations from the
Slovak—American community of
household goods to add to their
exhibit of a,Slovak neighbor—
hood. On display were decorat-
ed ceremonial eggs. ' In Slovakia,

the eggs were placed on the‘

graves of the dead as an offering
to the gods. The ancient Slavs
believed that the dead could be

carried by birds andcome to rest‘

in the trees.

Veronica Ratica-Hipp, the
artist who decorated the eggs on
display, learned the technique of
decorating from her father.

Many of those at the festival
had moved to Pittsburgh from
Slovakia and see the festival as a
way to reunite with the past and
the culture they left behind.
Frank Pochyba, standing in front
of a map of Slovakia looking for
the town in which he grew up,
has been in Pittsburgh for the
past 26 years. “The festival is a
good way to keep in Contact
with your roots,” he said. “When
people hear the music and see
the dances and displays, they are
seeing their roots.”

In addition to those with ties
to Slovakia, other people just
came out of interest. Kisiko
Hasegawa, a student at Pitt,
showed up with her Slovakian
friend. “I’m Korean and I’m just
amazed. There are just so many
people from other countries
here,” she said. She said this
country really was a melting pot
and that a ‘festival like this

.wouldn’t occur in her country.

“There are many people here
that don’t know the language of
their [native] country, but here
they can learn about it, they can
learn about their culture,” she
said. I

said.

Many women avoid self— examinations, howev-
er, afraid of what they might find, Harkins said.
“We’ve got to turn our thinking around,” she

said.

Up to 90 percentiof the lumps found are not
C cancerous, especially in young women, she said.

Harkins noted that about 2 percent of breast

cancer occurs in men. The most tragic effect on‘

men, however, is the emotional trauma which
occurs when a spouse, girlfriend or family mem-
ber develops the disease.

David Deluliis, a lifelong resi-
dent of Oakland, addressed the
decline of the community in
recent years.“This community
has gone downhill,” he said.

DeIuliis, a member of
Students United for Responsible
Government, proposed a “com—
munity credit class,”’‘ which
wouldoffer Pitt students credit
for serving the community.

Such a program would be
“incentive to do something that
may make a positive inﬂuence,”
he said.

Roger Hattman, another SURG
member, said a similar program

works “quite well” at Southern
Methodist University in Dallas.

SURG member Paul Prirozzola
advocated “safe haven” build-
ings in North and South
Oakland. 'These facilities,
equipped with campus phones
and located on shuttle routes,
would provide peace of mind
for students who live off cam-
pus while they are waiting for a
shuttle to take them to campus. A.

Guin Grogan, another SURG
candidate, supports women’s
concerns for safety.

“I want the university to

. implement ‘a self-defense class

which is held regularly,” she

said.’

Grogan also said campus
shuttle stops should be marked
with signs so riders know if they
are waiting at the right place.

Deena Buchanan said better
communications are needed
between‘ both the SGB and the
administration and between the
student body and the adminis-
uaﬁon. ~

Buchanan wants to establish
“automatic E-mail referendums.”
Any time a student logs into
Internet through Pitt, they could
vote yes or no on current con-

troversial issues.

SGB wouldlreceive the results

in about a week, she said.

Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape should also establish office
hours at Pitt to provide counsel-
ing and education, Buchanan
said. PAAR’s main office on the
South Side is inconvenient for
students seeking their services,
she said. '

Eric McKinley advocated the
establishment of a Women’s
Studies major, as well as a
women’s center. A

He said he would serve
“under-represented students,”
such as African Americans and
bisexuals, gays and lesbians.

Julie Crowell said she is also

interested in women’s issues
and wants‘ to “implement 2
nighttime escort service.”

‘Crowell also said she supports
an “adult women students’ orga-
nization,” which would address
the unique concerns of older
female students. .

Ross Pasquale, candidate for
SGB president, also addressec
women’s concerns at the meet-
ing. -

“I don't consider feminist 2

myself a feminist.”

Pasquale, active in SGB’:

encourage other victims tc
come forward and prosecute
their attackers. . _

“Right now, the system is
working against women,” he

model  it would hopefully
help solve a very large prob-

lem.”

students.

Parks said the legal service
program has significantly
expanded this year. The pro-

, gram began last year and pro-

vides free legal service to grad-
uate students.

According to Parks, problems
brought to GPSA range any-
where from landlord and tenant
disputes to immigration prob-
lems for international students.
“Students get a 20-minute
appointment for any legal prob-

lem a graduate student has,”
Parks said. Dennis Cline, who
practices general law locally,
serves as the attorney. Since
“the problems are so broad, it
didn’t make sense to get a spe-
cialist,” Parks said.

Parks also said the GPSA trav-
el fund has recently named two
recipients of S100 scholarships
to help with travel expenses
when a. student attends a con-
ference in their field of study.

Recipients of the scholarships
are chosen on a first come, first

Pitt’s computing labs over
the next few weeks.

According to Foner, the
survey will contain a series
of yes/no questions about
problems with the universi-
ty, knowledge of Pitt and
SGB programs and events
and involvement in student
groups.

Foner said students will
possibly be able to access
the survey as a folder under
the Telnet application on
Pitt’s mainframe, and
instructions will be available
in computer labs for the sur-
Vey’s users and lab consul-
tants.

Foner said he expects 400
to 500 students to eventually
take part in the survey. He
said he started the program
in an effort to receive stu-
dent input as quickly and
efficiently as possible.

“It’s too time consuming
to hand out surveys,” Foner
said. “It’s a lot easier
to fill [the computerized sur-
vey] out than if we were
to hand a survey to every-
one.

“The benefits of [the sur-
veyl are endless,” Foner said.
“Professors can benefit from
this because they’ll get a
general feeling of what they
should be teaching.”

Board Members Tara
Miunkatchy and August
Imholtz said they have been
working with Pitt Law
School Provost Mark
Nordenberg in an effort to
find a pre—law advisor at Pitt.

‘‘We’re looking for an-
« advisor who can help stu-

dents choose their classes,
set their goals  and help
them with the application
process, which is pretty
tough,” Imholtz said. .

Talle the talle,   walle —

The Student Government Board races have begun,

and fourteen board candidates have entered the race

on one bandwagon. They are all promising to do
something to increase the safety of the Pitt campus. It

has come to light, however, that although the candi-

dates all say they want to do something about safety,

, few are actually acting on it.

SGB Safety Committee Chair Derek Majika-s told The
Pitt News that only four of the candidates have actual-
ly met with him to discuss the problems of safety on
this campus. What this shows is that there is very little
substance behind the rhetoric. The candidates need to
find out what has already been tried so that they don’t

- start from scratch and repeat ineffective actions when

attempting to solve a problem.

While safety is an important concern for all members
of the campus community, there are a number of other
issues that remain unaddressed despite their impor-
tance. These issues include, but are not limited to

. parking, registration by telephone, racial tensions, and

professor evaluations. These are issues board members
could research and realistically take action on. .

SGB president Jacob Brody brought up an important
point when he said, “We need to see some new ideas.”
His advice is to “look for those candidates with new
issues.” ‘

It is time for the candidates to_ stop just talkinghabout
communication and to begin doing something about it.
Their base is the student body, whom they are elected
to serve. It is time for the candidates to begin speaking

0 to the students during the campaign to find out what

needs to be done, This way they can begin to
research and develop solutions to problems before
they are elected. O _

While the issues mentioned are a- start, the list is by
no means exhaustive. It is not enoughlfor the members
of the SGB to merely be aware that a problem exists;
they must have wellthought-out plans that can be
used to lead the student body. It is up to them to do

- their homework and address these problems. As won-

derful as large scale plans sound, reality must be con-
sidered as well. We would all like to hire more police
officers and add more shuttles but budget constraints
often tie into the decision making process. Candidates

* should look into all aspects of a situation and then find

new angles to approach it. Look at past proposals, talk
to people already involved, contact past and present
board members to find out exactly how they
approached problems.

With that, The Pitt News issues a challenge to the
fourteen candidates running for the SGB. Find out
what the students need. Develop well constructed
plans to help meet these needs and carry them out. Let
the students know before they give you their vote on
November 17 what you will do for them besides
promising them a safe place to live. Most importantly,
let them know exactly how you will do it.

Top Ten Reasons Why Waste Technologies
Industries Should Be Shut Down:

10. It’s European-owned and built to dispose of
European hazardous waste.

9. There is no need for this incinerator; we
already have an overcapacity.

8. \VI‘I doesn’t have a valid permit; the company
that presently owns the facility is
not the company to which a permit
was issued.

7. WTI failed its last test burn.

6. The WTI incinerator is illegal.

WTI illegal, dangerous, needs to go

Kissel

losing their hair.
1. This toxic waste incinerator is located less than
400 yards from an elementary school.

WTI, the world’s largest capacity commercial
hazardous waste incinerator, has been proven
unsafe, illegal, unneeded and unwanted, yet it
still exists and has begun commercial burning. If
you think that this disposal plant is
someone else’s problem, think
again. This facility is located only
35 miles upwind from you. Tons
of toxic waste will be traveling up

It is located 300 feet from homes

‘(Ohio state law requires a 2,000

footbuffer zone.).

5. We have the technology to provide at least 18
alternatives to -incineration.

4. Over 40 organizations have protested this pro-
ject, only one has advocated it — the town’s
Chamber of Commerce. (Personal financial inter-
est or what? You decide.)

3. During optimal performance, WTI will spew
out 4.7 tons of lead per year (which causes brain
damage, especially in chi1dren)'plus thousands o
pounds of ‘dioxins, furans and PCB’s. ' '
2. Since it started burning at partial capacity in
March, women workers have already reported

our rivers, on our roads and
through our backyards to facilitate
this monster incinerator.

A rally was held in Washington, D.C., this
Saturday to protest the incinerator and discuss
progressive alternatives.WTI sits on what can
only bedescribed as the worst possible site for a
toxic waste incinerator (save the San Andreas
fault). If an incinerator can be built at this site,
then one can be built anywhere. WTI should be
shut down.

The health and safety of many people, includ-

ing yourself, depends on it.

LETTERS

Not all conspirators

For the past two months, I
have read article after article
and letter after letter in The Pitt
News regarding racism on cam-
pus and conflicts between vari-
ous student groups. Often, I
have been outraged and
appalled by comments from all
sides, but until now, I felt that
my distance from the situation
gave me no right to comment.
Having read the latest com-
ments by Oscar Eybers, howev-
er, I must voice my disgust.

I fully realize that racism is a
problem on this campus, as it is
on many campuses.

It is a problem that needs to
be actively pursued and elimi-
nated. but giving in to paranoia
and generalizations just increas-
es the difficulty of the task. I
apologize to Eybers if he is
offended by my opinion that
his comment, “Everyone knows
that Pitt is part of the conspira-
cy against the African nation,” is
based in paranoia. However, I
was greatly offended by the
obvious indication that each
and every student and faculty

member at this university is
involved in such a conspiracy. I
consider myself to be a part of
Pitt, but I most definitely do not
consider myself a conspirator
against African-Americans, here
or anywhere else. I cannot tol-
erate the accusation that Eybers
is making.As for the rest of
Eybers’ letter, it is cryptic and
confusing. I ‘don’t know what
his ultimate goal is, but racial
harmony does not seem to be
the most important part of his
plan.This may not be my call to
make. Next time, Mr. Eybers,
specify your target, or you"ll
soon alienate those who would
have fought for your cause.

Gun laws needed
Recently, The Pitt News has
been printing articles express-
ing opposition to Councilman
Wagner’s proposed ban on
assault weapons in the city of
Pittsburgh. These writers keep
using old arguments that simply
don’t work anymore.
”Bureaucratic legislation is
not the panacea for social
problems”. Quit using lawyerly

crap, we are talking about
human life here! If this bill
saves ONE life, it is worth it.

“(Name of city here) has
some of the toughest gun laws
in the country and their murder
rate is rising.” That is because
you can get guns outside the
city limits. That is why Congress
should pass this law.

“Criminals get their guns from
the black market, they don’t
buy weapons from gun stores.”
Talk to John Hinkley.

‘.‘Outlawing alcohol and drugs
hasn’t stopped their sales, it
won’t with guns either.” You
can’t compare these issues.
Why? Because if I buy Alcohol
and Drugs, I am choosing to
destroy my own life. With Smith
and Wesson, somebody else is
choosing to destroy me.

Unfortunately, Mr. Wagner is
out of office after this year. I
never liked him before. I’m
starting to like him now. I’m
beginning to think that the
wrong Democratic candidate for
Mayor won.

Miami ovrwhelms 

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Early in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s I

Pitt—Miami game, Hurricane running back
Lany Jones cut right on an innocent-look-
ing run up the middle.

Pitt safety Doug Whaley took a pursuit
angle, but the 255-pound fullback blew
right by the 185-pound safety and cruised
the rest of the way to an 88-yard touch-
down. : .

“I saw a hole open up on the inside,
and I went in.the hole,” Jones said. “I saw
the free safety coming. I stepped on the
hammer and I just went off to the races.”

Miami took advantage of adramatic
edge in. team speed on both sides of the
football as they_stormed out to a 28-0
halftime lead and held on to a 35-7 victo-
ry.
“We were prepared, but they are just
good athletes,” junior offensive tackle
Reuben Brown said. “They’re not as
strong as they are fast. [I am] not sur-

prised that they were as fast as they .

were.”
“Speed puts them up top [in the

nation],” said Pitt quarterback John Ryan. \

Pitt ran the ball effectively and protect-
ed Ryan well in recent weeks, but could
do neither against the quick Hurricane
defense. Pitt ran for only 19 yards on 38
attempts. The number is somewhat mis-
leading because it includes Miami’s nine
sacks for 56 yards in losses.

“A sack is the ultimate sin,” Brown said.
“It really sticks with you ‘more than miss-

‘ing a block on a run. You try to fight ~

through those things.”

One of “those things” for Miami had
been slow starts, but that changed on
Saturday. Dexter Seigler returned the
opening kickoff to the Miami 41. Two
plays later, Hurricane tailback James
Stewart took in a screen pass, broke loose
behind the block of center K.C. Jones, cut
all the ‘way across the field and rumbled
in for a 55-yard touchdown.

The Panthers were down 7-0 only 53

seconds into the game.

“We finally started to get some big
plays the last three weeks,” Miami head
coach Dennis Erickson said. “That’s
something we need to do to be success-
ful. You need those to score points.”

Pitt responded with a quick three-plays-
and-punt, and Miami was on the move
again. The Panthers blew achance to
stop the advance when cornerback
Denorse Mosley droppedan interception.
Hurricane quarterback Ryan Collins hit
reserve tight end Dietrick Clausell for a

nine-yard touchdown to cap a nine-play,
53-yard scoring drive.

Miami extended its lead to 21-0 with
another long drive (4:42) as the second
quarter began. ‘Canes’ rookie Jammi
German returned a punt 30 yards to set
Miami up at its own 43. Collins completed
four of five passes on the 11—play, 57-yard
drive, including an eight-yard toss to a
leaping Chris Jones for the score.

The Pitt volleyball team
has had trouble with let-

teams like the lowly

teams that they visited
this weekend. I

“It may not be pretty,
but we can get a couple
W’s,” Pitt head coach
Cindy Bra'ziel said before
the team left for New
England.

The Panthers (19-8)
took care of business this
time, taking out bo.th
opponents with 3-0 match
victories. Saturday’s victo-
ry at Boston College
scaled up a perfect regu-
lar_ Big East record (7-0),
giving them the title and
the top seed in the con-
ference tournament. '

Pitt opened, at Rhode
Island Friday’ night, win-
ning three tight games,
,15—12, 15-10, 15-11.,The
‘Panthers at-tacked at an
efficient .351 clip for the
match; far above their
.249 season average. Four
Pitt players reached dou-
ble figures in kills. In
addition to top hitters Ann
Marie Lucanie (18 kills)
and Jennie Driscoll (11),
middle hitter Sarah Mikla
and outside hitter Sara
Mitchell continued their
recent hot streaks with 14
kills each. Setter Annie
Mernagh dished out 54
assists (18 per game, five
above her season aver-
age).

Pitt was not as effective
serving, with a relatively
low three aces and 11 ser-
vice errors. _ i

The Rams served better
(seven aces, nine service
errors), but had a typical-
ly low .165 attack per-
centage. Sophomore
Sabrina Pozzi had a solid
match with 17 kills and a
.361 hitting percentage,
but had little help.

Saturday’s match started
with more of the same for
the Panthers, a tight 15-13
game one victory. Pitt dis-
mantled the Eagles in the
second game, 15-6, with
16 kills and only two
errors on 22 attacks (.636

and downthe field in an
effort to keep warm.

This was especially true of

ing rusher, running for 135
yards and one touchdown on
eight carries. 3

fourth quarter by way of an
88-yard burst of speed for a
touchdown.

Miamiphad the ball on its
own 12-yard line following a

ing penalty on.Miami on the
runback.

“The play was originally
designed to go outside. I saw
the hole open up inside, so I
went for it," Jones said.
"When I hit the hole cleanly, I
spotted the free safety out of

' the corner of my eye.
’"I just stepped on the gas

with Miami, thinking. along _

' However, it seemed as if
Miami used the cold tempera- '

kickoff from Pitt and a hold- '

and I was off to the races,”
Jones said.

Jones’ 88-yard touchdown
run came at an opportune
time for Miami, as Pitt had just
scored a touchdown on the
previous play from scrimmage
to make it 28-7. The big play
-for Miami served to squash
any momentum the Panthers
might have started to acquire.
This sentiment was shared by
some Miami fans who were at
the game.

“Pitt had just scored a
touchdown and were starting
to get back into the game.
Miami answered back to push
the lead back to‘four touch-

for that big play,” Matthew

to be successful,” Erickson
said.

The big play is something
Larry Jones always hason his
mind. “I line upon everyplay
thinking to myself that I’m
going to break it big,” he said.

Jones is a six-foot, 235-
pound junior fullback from

' Gainesville, Florida. He is one

of the strongest of the
Hurricane fullbacks who can
benchpress andsquat over
400 pounds.

_ Jones came into this season
as a projected starter at full-

back, but has been forced to’

share playing time with other
Miami fullbacks this season

due to the Hurricanes’ depth
at running backs.

“He has shared time this
season with Donnell Bennett
and the other backs," Jim
Maitz, editor of the University
of Miami publication
Canesport, said. "This was
his best game of the season so
far." , _

Jones hopes his perfor-
mance against Pitt will con-
vince the coaches to give him
more playing time.

“We have so many good

lbacks here, it’s hard not to

keep some people out of the
Same- .

"Hopefully, , after today, the
coaches will pay a little more
attention to me,” he said.

He may not have been one

of the offensive centers-of- 3

attention for Miami this year,
but last Saturday against Pitt
was definitely Jones’ day.

In Miami's locker room after
the game, there were newspa-

. per reporters and television

cameras huddled around
Jones’ pounding him with
questions. _

Other Miami players walk-
ing by set the tone -for the
post-game analysis shouting
out, “He's the star today —
he’s the star.”

rookie tailback Billy West took
a directsnap on a_ fake punt.
West bobbled the snap and two
Hurricane defenders smothered
him for a loss of two yards.

Miami took over on the Pitt 38.
The Hurricanes took just over
a minute to convert. Miami got
first downs on a 12-yard reverse
by ﬂanker Jonathan Harris and a

nine-yard burst up the middle '

by Jones. On first—and—ten at the
Pitt 13, Whaley saved a touch-
down by tipping away a pass
intended for German, German
got revenge on the ensuing
third down, pulling in a touch-3
down pass on a similar play.
“My first touchdown [is]
something I will always remem-

golden teeth. “[It’sl something

. that will always be in my heart.”

.The Hurricanes nearly scored

the Panther defense held at its

Miami took a 28-0 lead into

On the first play from the two,

stopped short of the goal line.

“‘I jumped like it was a

West got those few inches on

tor, announced the upgrading of the facilities for
use by athletes.

According to Sanford, he drew up a proposal for
a band room in the stadium seven years ago, but
the administration was not responsive.

“I understand that cuts are being made every-
where, but if [the administra— tion] keeps taking
away from us, soon we’ll be left with nothing,”
band member Christy Slifky said.

Sanford said some band members were also
upset by Pitt’s denial of a request for two parent
tickets for the Boston College game on November
13 instead of the usual one alloted to each band
member.

The band gives a parent’s day performance dur-
ing the game and a concert in the Cost Center after
the game. In the past, Pitt has given each band

member two tickets for the parents’ day game.

“How can I justify to the band that they are only
given one ticket, when football players can get

several?” Sanford said.

“We don’t complain about the various benefits
given athletes, but ‘we do put in just as many
hours, and I think they deserve an extra ticket for

parents’ day.”
