pressed Minorities” will be today’s
Inquiry Forum topic with Dr. Her-
bert Hudnut, pastor of the Bellevue
Presbyterian Church leading the
discussion in 129 Cathedral at 1
o’clock.

Dr. Hudnut’s observations on the

voted much time to a study of condi-
tions about which he is speaking to-
day.

For two years, from 1933-1935, Dr.
Hudnut served as‘ president of the
board of trustees of the Children’s
Service bureau of Pittsburgh. Prior
to that time he was a member of the
board of National Missions of the
Presbyterian church.

V Before coming to Bellevue, he held
pastorates in Dallas and Cleveland.
He has been at his present post since
1932.

Inquiry Forum sessions are held
every Monday and are sponsored
jointly _by YM-YWCA. During the
ﬁrst half of the hour the speaker de-
livers his viewpoint. Members of
the audience qu‘estion him during
the remainder of the period.

Heading the Inquiry Forum exec-
utive committee is John Fritzmeier,
C39. Alice Rotzsche, C39, and Dor-
othy Cleleand, C40 are included on

Boston Educator

Raps Colleges’

Lox Registration Requirements

BOSTON, Mass, Dec. 12.-—Nearly‘>

half of the boys and girls who regis-
tered in the nation’s colleges this
fall will. fail to receive their diplo-
mas and degrees four years from
now. a study just released by Dean
Everett W. Lord, noted Boston uni-
versity educator, reveals.

The article entitled “Student Per-
sistence in American Colleges” ap-
pears in the November number of
The Diary, official magazine of Al-
pha Kappa Psi, international com-
merce fraternity, for which the
study was made.

Reduced to barest arithmetical es- -

sentials, Dean Lord’s report shows
that of 214,000 freshmen who regis-
tered in 241 of the nation’s colleges,
including the University of Pitts-
burgh which cooperated in the sur-
vey, 99,644 failed to graduate with-
in their four-year period of collegi-
ate work.

Partially at fault for this appall-
ing student mortality are the col-
leges, Dean Lord’s survey states,
since 5,000 of the “detached” fresh-
men, failed their courses so com-
pletely it
should have been admitted to col-
lege in the first place.

IS

apparent that they .

In all, between 25,000 and 30,000
students are dropped from college
for scholastic deﬁciencies or failures.
The tragedy which befalls these stu-
dents, writes Dean Lord, is not suf-
ﬁciently appreciated by colleges or
society.

These students are, in effect,
blacklisted by all other colleges and,
to a certain extent, by business.
They have been deﬁnitely -labeled
as “failures” and are likely to bear
the stigma of their shortcomings for
years.

“Reclamation departments” or di-
visions of remedial education are
suggested by Dean Lord to help
these students.

Academic mortality is highest
among freshmen (60,000) and lowest
among juniors (15,000), the report
shows. Startling is the fact that
19,000 boys and girls who have com-
pleted three years of college work
fail in their senior year.

Nor are there any “safe” instistu—
tions, from the undergraduates’

likely to. fail in a large institution
as in a small one. Mortality  col-

l,,284 Scientists Sign Manifesto

For Preservation of Democracy 

Signed by 1,284 American scien-¢

tists, including three University fac-
ulty rnembers, a manifesto summon-
ing their colleagues to participate

is-.ctiv::)ly in the defense of democracy

as the sole means of preserving,in-
tellectual freedom and insuring sci-
entific progress was released yes-
terday.

Dr. Alexaiicler Silverman, head of
the chemistry department, Dr. A. L.
Robinson, assistant professor of
chemistry, and Dr. A. G. Worthing,
professor of physics, were among
those taking the anti-fascist stand.

Based on :1 resolution passed last
December by the American Associa-
tirn for the Advancement of Science,
the manifesto declares, “Science is
wholly independent of national

5 boundaries and races and creeds and

can ﬂourish only when there is peace
oml intellectual freedom.”

Dr. John P. Peters, professor of
Internal Medicine at Yale university;
Dr. Henry E. Sigerist, director of the
Intstitute of the History of Medicine
at Johns Hopkins university; D. J.
Struik, professor of mathematics at
M. ,1. T. and editor of “Science and

Society”; Harold C. Urey; and Dr.‘

Milton C. Winternitz, professor of

pathology and former dean of the
Yale Medical School.

Members of the committee releas-
ing the statement are Professor
Boaz; Dr, Karl M. Bowman, profes-
sor of psychiatry at New York uni-
rel’.-zity and director of the division
of psychiatry in the New York City
department of hospitals; Wesley
Clair Mitchell, professor of econom-
ice at Columbia university and di-
rector of research for the National
,Bureau of Economic Research.

“The present outrages in Ger-
many,” said Chairman Franz Boaz,
of Columbia university, “have made
it necessary for American scien-
‘:'i:.~"r.s to take this firm anti-fascist
stand. Our manifesto declares
that we scientists have the moral ob-
ligation to educate the American
people against all false and unscien-
tiﬁc doctrines, such as the racial
nonsense of the Nazis.”

Theymanifesto stated that any at-
tack upon freedom of thought in one
sphere is in effect an attack on de-
mocracyitself; that when men like
Albert,‘ Einstein may no longer con-
tinue their. work, whether the reason
is ‘race, creed, or belief, all mankind
suffers.

An Educator
‘ 0

Suggests Reclamation’
IT is common knowledge that a large percentage

of college freshmen who enter American aca-
demic halls witl1 high hopes fail to last out the
regulation four years.

The report, therefore, of a survey made for
Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity by Dean Everett WV.
Lord of Boston university is not at all startling.
In its revelation that nearly half of the students
admitted to colleges in the United States fail to
complete the course, the survey is merely backing
up a foregone conclusion with deﬁnite and authen-

tic ﬁgures.
Dean Lord, in his study entitled “Student Per-

sistence in American Colleges” performs an im-

portant service in breaking down the ﬁgures sub-
mitted by 241 colleges and universities throughout
the country, and drawing from them conclusions
as to the decided inadequacy of certain aspects _of
American education.

The survey, for instance, deplores the fact that
an average of 25,000 students are dropped every
year for scholastic deﬁciency—or. as we would
say it, ﬂunked. These unfortunate students, the
report explains, “have learned to distrust‘ their
own abilities,” few of them can enter another
school, and even less are wanted by employers.

As a possible solution to this problem, Dean Lord
suggests rather casually that there might be'1n
every college a “Reclamation department,” -which
“can undertake to save the large proportion of
good—intentioned students who fall by the way-

side before they are able to acclimate themselves

to an academic atmosphere.”

It is possible that such a._“reclamation,’ or ad-
vanced orientation plan n11gl1t have some’ eﬁect,

7

although it appears quite obvious that the idea
twould not provide a solution for the problem.

seems to us, rather, that it would be merely a case
of trying to make the best of a bad situation.
Lord ’s report, however, hints a.t the underlying
cause, which must be remedied before any last-
ing solution can be achieved. “Probably the great-

est number of these young people should never

7?

have been admitted to college, says he, and then
goes on to declare that until some more satisfactory
method of evaluating the qualiﬁcations of appli-
cants is devised there seems to be little hope of re-
ducing the number of misﬁts.”

VVe don’t see how Dean Lord, with a straight
face, can possibly say that we lack methods of
evaluating educational qualiﬁcations. ’l‘h.ere_are,
after all, such things as entrance examinations,
previous academic records, and other methods,
which, though not at all perfect or fool—proof,
can probably do a good weeding—out job of educa-
tional misﬁts.

\Vl1at the Boston educator seems to be referring
to is the entirely too large group of mediocre hitch-
hikers on our educational bandwagon. He de-
plores the fact that so many of these hangers-on
clutter up our academic processes.

But he seems to be attacking the problem from
the standpoint of practical necessity. There
seems to be in the back of his mind the common
conviction that this miscast element is necessary
if our huge educational plants are to continue in
their process of mass production.

It’s the old, old story that the under-average
students help to pay the way of many of the more
able students who must be admitted on free schol-
arships, as well as helping to round out‘ the full
quota of students an institution of higher learning
must have if it is to continue in the blue book.

According to this formula, stiff entrance exams
and a general tightening up of academic stand-
ards would seem to be at present highly “imprac-
tical” in the American scheme of education.

Dean Lord rather hesitantly attempts to com-
promise on a “reclamation” scheme. All things
considered, it seems to us to be a pretty feeble sub-
stitutc.

American Scientists
Go On Record

NEVV and powerful voice in the rising tide of

protest against Fascism and dictatorship is
heard in the manifesto just signed by 1,284 Ameri-
can scientists.

To deplore suppression of intellectual freedom
and advocate the defense of democracy is nothing
new on the present muddled horizon of interna-
tional affairs. That such a numerous and inﬂuential
group of educators should make a joint manifesto,
however, makes this protest all the more import-
ant, coming, as it does, from most of the best‘ minds
in American scientiﬁc circles.

We wish to add our relatively unimportant voice
to those of Professor Franz Boas of Columbia uni-
versity, all thcﬂsigners, and especially those mem-
bers of the ‘University, faculty who ,have _added

their names in appropriate protest. _ ,  .

Emil “Yippee for the Jr. Prom” Naric took the whole
thing seriously and tried to revive Hoffman. The farce
broke when Bud, who is very ticklish, giggled.

Brown Study . . .

by Robert Brown

The petitions circulating about the campus for the
passage of the Ludlow referendum are meeting up
with some terriﬁc opposition. It is not the usual resist-
ance encountered against anything even mildly “pro-
gressive.” It is opposition of a sincere and honest sort.

The opposition advances three chief arguments
against the passage of the referendum. Summarized,
they are: (1) The President alone should be allowed
to hold the threat of war in his hands, in order that his
foreign policy may have some strength behind its de-
mands; (2) Congressmen, because of their training and

experience, are less likely to be swayed towards war

than an irresponsible populace; and (3) people do not
think rationally in times of stress, as was proven just
before our entrance into the Great War.

President in Emergency

Perhaps the Presidents should be given dictatorial
powers, but have not done very well in the past in
cases of emergency. They have played a leading hand
in involving the country into war. McKinley, a puppet
of big sugar interests, was led to declare war on the
Phillipines that “our little brown brothers might see the
light.” After Wilson made up his mind, his eloquent
phrases got this country in the right psychological state
for ﬁghting. And there are other examples of Pres-
idential mismanagement; the Mexican, Spanish-Ameri-
can, and Nicarauguan ﬁascos—pure travesties on weak
nations.

And there are our Congressman, shining examples
of unbiased thinking. How well they understand the
tariff and world trade and the host of unponderables
which make for war. With what unctous righteousness
did they declare war in 1917, even though only two
of them did any ﬁghting. I suppose they did their bit
by making four minute speeches about “our brave
boys,” visiting the hospitals, and then spending money
hand over fist after the war in an attempt to save
American civilization from slipping out from under
them.

The third argument is the most powerful one offered
by the opposition. Won’t the people be swayed by mass
hysteria and propaganda during a crisis, as they were
in 1917.

The People and Propaganda

I don’t think so. For one thing, they could not make
a worse muddle of things than their statesmen and rep-
resentatives. But there are other evidences which lead
me to believe that the people will do some straight
thinking.

For there are soldiers living today who know that
war is no tea party. They have heard the thud of mor-
tars hitting the trenches, and they remember the white
faces of men draped over tangled wire. The
unemployed realize that a greater force than the Re-
publicans brought on the depression. The younger
generation has been reading and thinking and study-
ing. They have visited hospitals where men whose
faces were partly blown away scream in the darkened
wards. They have seen the frightened faces of chil-
dren under ﬁre in the Spanish streets.

Of course, there were peace movements before the
Great War. But they were unorganized sentiments, a
vague sort of Gestalt against war.

I am not saying that a thing like the Ludlow bill
will stop war. War’s great forces, economic and psy-
chological, are not stopped easily. They can only be
halted by a deﬁnite program that will ‘ﬁrst outlaw war,
and then make it as outmoded as duelling. The Lud-
low referendum is a chance to makes-the -people peace-
conscious before they are swept into unreasoning hys-

teria. Western civilization may then rise to greater‘

things, instead of beinga smoking ruin, desolate in its
gleam. .. V q . . ’ .. q .

Marquee . . . *

By Bill Colker

Emerging from make-believe into
very much of a reality, Frances
Farmer and a group of screen and
stage notables were guests of honor
at a gathering of the “Friends of
the Abraham Lincoln Brigade” «'a
few nights ago to help raise money
for the rehabilitation of Americans
who fought for Loyalist Spain.

Sam Jaffe, whom you all remem-
ber as the Grand Lama in “Lost

_Horizon” was there.
I

Sylvia Sidney was there.

Irwin Shaw, author of that now
famous play “Bury the Dead” was
there. He has written “Gentle Peo-
ple” scheduled for a Broadway pre-
miere January 5.

The entire cast of the Group The-
ater’s “Golden Boy” was there.

And it was all for a very serious
occasion. Miss Farmer stated it
concisely when she said, “You all
know Why we’re here. For Spain!”

She then vigorously denounced
Fascism and all that it represents.
Concluding her short talk she said,
“In those of you who do not under-
stand and feel as deeply as we do,
we hope to create a similar desire.”

Touching was that part of the
program where the audience and
the guests of honor voiced the song
the Loyalists sang at Madrid, “No
Pasaran,” they shall not pass. It
was an expression of a sincere and
honest emotion.

Kind-faced Sam Jalfe is direct-
ing and playing a role in Shaw’s
“Gentle People.” So is Sylvia Sid-
ney, Miss Farmer, and Franchot
Tone who would have been at the
gathering but for retakes on his last
picture,- but who will join the Group
Theater in New York.

In the time I spent with them at
their table, I tried in every way to
determine the basic significance of
the new play. I got flashing smiles
and evasive answers. It seems they
are withholding any reference to the
play until it opens. But through a
“source,” I can say if it turns out to
be anti-"fascist in tone, say you read

it here.

Art Cinema . . .

“Mamlock” the picturebeing held
over at the Art Cinema delivers the
greatest indictment against Nazism
yet dared to be shown on the screen.
For the first time in my life I be-
came so thoroughly immersed in the
intense story—in the suffering of Dr.
Mamlock’ and in the underground
campaign—that even though the ac-
tcrs,spoke in Russian, I needed no
translation. The emotion projected
by beautifully capable actors was
in itself so universal a language, one
could not help but catch that pas-
sion and be thrilled and terrified
by it. .

If you haven’t as yet thoroughly
understood what has happened in
Germany, you’ll be chilled and
shocked into the realization. Even
more so when you know that the
story is based on actuality, having
been written by a doctor who ﬂed
Germany after cheating the firing
squad.

Words seem so pitifully inade-
quate aftcr having watched the
fright‘. on the faces of all races and
creeds who witnessed the picture.
It is an expression of fear that says,
“After all, it is a picture represen-
tative of the plight of a foreign

people, but who knows . .”

Pittsburgh Playhouse . . .

Tom Wilmot, proud parent of num-
ber one child, “And Niobe Wept,”
now playing at the Pittsburgh Play-
house, has done a good job of play
Writing. But the first attempt of
Mr. Wilmot (former Joe Penner gag-
man) at a three-act play is detract-
ed a bit by choice of morbid topic——
a family weaned on gall and vine-
gar displaying violent hatred one for
the other.

In The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News

Dear Sir:
The Ludlow amendment would ac-
complish nothing. Congressmen

never declare war unless public sen-
timent is overwhelmingly in favor
of taking up arms. They are too
smart to risk their political and cor-
poral necks.

Besides, politicians on the whole
are better informed on such ‘matters
than the average voter. These men
in Congress, especially the Senators,
really know what issues are at stake
and so cannot be propagandized out
of all reason.

Debate in Congress would pro-
vide all time necessary for due con-

sideration, the point stressed so ap-
pealingly by proponents of the
amendment. Nor would this move-
ment unite all peace advocates; it
would turn their peace councils into
councils of war due to endless bick-
erings over matters of policy.

So why waste the taxpayers’
money to merely give them the right
to declare war when Congress can

do _tl1e_declaring just as well as the

vot_e1js_. themselves‘ ,wou_1d do at the

iéhii’ is. Burnham, on.

BY LEONARD LEVISON

Sports Editor

From the clippings that have been wandering in these past hectic
days, we may assume for ‘the purpose of ge11eralizatio11_. that‘ the
present state of intercollegiate athletics is fraught with 1nstal)1l1t_\'.
‘“.'hV else, if the situation were not acute. would that thoroughly
alai-lining phrase, “dangerous precedent” be bandied about as much

as it has been?

_ - L
From two different sources, one 111'

the misrepresented south and the
other on the shores of the Paciﬁc, we
have received reports that describe
the state of affairs in terms of that
horrid phrase. But, in both cases it
seems apparent that nothing is go-
ing to be done about the thing ex-
cept call it the bad name.

The first report comes from Rich-
mond, Virginia, the campus site of
the University of Richmond, which
has been well plastered on the sports
map by that able propagandist, Leon-
ard Littman, C37. The “dangerous
precedent” in this case is that the
Richmond students have been asked
by athletic director Glenn Thistle-
waite to pay to see Pitt play Rich-
mond in basketball on Monday, De-
cember 19.

Asks Book Voids

In more detail, Thistlewaite has
asked the campus to void its athletic
books and help balance the athletic
budget by kicking through to see
the Panthers in action. That this has
not met with a favorable response is
evident by the way in which the
Richmond Collegian refers to it—
“dangerous precedent.”

A student vote has been ordered
and we are still waiting for the re-
sults. According to the Collegian, if
the students rebuke the Thistlewaite
proposal as it has asked them to,
Thistlewaite can call the game off.
Thistlewaite says the game hasn’t
been deﬁnitely scheduled, according
to the campus sheet.

Carlson's Puffers

VVhen Dr. Carlson and his ice cream
puffers left for the West, they were
still under the impression that they
were going to play in old Virginny
during the holiday recess. This leads
us to believe that the game will be
played, names or no names, admission
or no admissions. '

We believe moreover that the
southerners have a good point and
that the student body is quite right
in not wanting to allow itself to be
exploited by the athletic department.

Al Masters, graduate manager of
athletics at Stanford, was the gen-
tleman who found a “dangerous
precedent” being established on the
Pacific Coast. He was referring to
such personal matter as summer va-
cations.

Good Company

It seems that the University of

Southern California and UCLA have

a rather chummy lot when it comes-

to their football players. And when
the time came for a summer vaca-
tion the boys of each respective
school got together for a few weeks
of relaxation.

The Rose Bowl boys at USC all
decided to go fishing at Virginia
Lake, California. Strange coinci-
dence as it may be, when they ar-
rived there was head varsity coach

Howard Jones and some of his

staff.

They were all together so the con-
versation naturally drifted to foot-
ball. Before long, they were run-
ing through some plays.

About the same time a similar
situation occurred at Lake Arrow-
head where the UCLA boys bumped
into coach Bill Spaulding. Of course,
this could not be referred to as a
summer camp, for such an idea is
outlawed in the Pacific Coast Con-
ference rules.

All that is going to be done about
the matter is that Masters has called
it a dangerous precedent.

Kappa Sigs Win,

Basketball found itself in the
limelight Thursday night as the
Greeks opened the ﬁght to unseat
Kappa Sigma from the basketball
championship it has held for the
past four consecutive years.

However, the defending champs
continued their winning ways by
eking out a 15-14 victory over Delta
Tau Delta. Ben Kish paced the
leaders with six points. -Emil Naric
ended up as the “goat“ when he
failed to sink a free throw at the

termination of the game with a
chance to tie the score. A

Phi Delta Theta whipped Lambda
Chi Alpha rather easily on the Trees
ﬂoor, 37-18. Bob Dannies led the
winners’ scoring with ‘six ﬁeld goals
for a total of 12 points. Thescore
at half was 15-9 with the Phi Delts
holding the upper hand.

Bill Edmunds starred as Phi

Gamma Delta defeated Phi Epsilon '

Pi, 22-12.

The scene shifts to the stadium
where the ﬁnal three games of the
evening were played. Phi Kappa
went wild in the second half to win
over Pi Kappa Alpha, 34-18. At half-
time, the score read 12-10 with the
ultimate winners‘ ahead. Glenn and
Halloran were leading score for the
winners with 10 and 8 points re-
spectively. - . .

Donald “Duck” Ceferratti led the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon -to a victory
over Pi Lambda Phi as he scored 18
of his team’s 27 points and the Pi-
Lams were only able to come
through with 15. '

Tying Ceferratti as leading scorer
for the night was Jimmy Stark of
Sigma Alpha Mu. Jim also had 18
points, 10 more than the combined
total of Sigma Chi, his opponents.
“Tut” Feldman was second high with
10 points as the SAM’S won, 48-8.
Dziekiewicze had six of Sigma Chi’s
eight points.

McSorley to Start New Line Trio
Against Baldwin-Wallace Skaters

1938

PAGE THREE

Joe Kristufek, Panther net star,
was ranked sixth in Western Penn-
sylvania this year according to re-
ports released by the Pittsburgh
Tennis association.

He was ranked ﬁrst in men’s dou-
bles along with Ralph Bald, who
captained the Pitt varsity team last

Finally realizing on two years,
effort to mold a COlIlpl€l9l_\' bal-l
anced hockey team. Coach John!
3IcSorley announced over the?
week-end that he would start 
brand new line of Shiring, Broidai
and Cusick against Baldwin-Wallace;
tomorrow night. This gives Pitt nc-S
fewer than three lines capable of 
starting a game. 5

All three of the new front liners
are ex-defense men. Except for}
goalie Ellis the starting line-up will.‘
show the burliest team yet to take;
the ice for Pitt with Chuck Connick:
and Walt Lovett rounding out thel
combination on defense. 

Defense to Score

Besides putting the Panthers on a
par physically with the big Baldwin-
Wallace sextet, Mcsorley means to‘
give the defense men a chance to get
a scoring “complex” -— something
they’ve always lacked, although Shir-
ing has scored twice from his defense
position in the last two games.

Walt Lovett, known as the “score-
less wonder,” because of his inability
to score or even register so much as
an assist in his two years on the
Panther varsity, is an example of
this. He’s still a good defense man
in McSorley’s little book.

Shiring and Lovett are the two ex-
tremes, the other defense men hav-
ing only one or two points to their
credit.

“Dream Line”

I It’s not yet deﬁnite what role the
"dream line” of Schooley, Friday and
Brittain will play in the game, but
McSorley will probably not use them
much against the bruising Bereai
Tigers. The fast lightweight ﬁrst
line is too valuable to be wasted on
this in-the—bag game.

The second line, Artz, Schildecker,
and Lowe, which has so far been the
most valuable as far as all-around,
scoring and ruggedness is concerned,-'
willbear the brunt of the attack.

These three boys, who go along
without fan—fare or fancy nicknames
are the ideal type of shock-troopers.
Frequently, in. practice they play
“mighty mites” to a standstill and
more often beat them.

Baptism of Fire ,

Schildecker, playing his ﬁrst sea-
son in organized hockey, has espe-
cially pleased his coach. Mcsorley
gave him a baptism of ﬁre in the
very ﬁrst game by starting him
against John Carroll. He has started
every game since.

Pitt News Sports Staﬂ Names; Marshall Goldberg
As Captain of 1938 All-Pittsburgh Football Eleven

By Bill Mazefsky

Unfortunately someone said, “Let’s
pick an All-City football team,” and
the sports staff of the Pitt News
started an argument that sounded as
confused as the City Council debate
on the tax boost.

There were seven different selec-
tors trying to ram their selections in-
to 11 positions — maybe if there
were 33 posts available on the
team, the matter
would have been
settled in a qui-
eter fashion.

Maybe if Frank
S c o t t , football
manager, hadn’t
wandered in just
when a satisfac-
tory compromise
had been reach-
ed, the matter
would have been
settled. Scott had
to be placated,

leges which admit from 101 to 200
freshmen annually is slightly high-
er than that of other institutions but,
Dean Lord points out, the difference
is not large enough to be sig-
nilicant.

Fully 29 per cent of freshmen and
25 per cent of upperclass students
drop out of college for ﬁnancial rea-
sons, the repozt shows; this, despite
the millions of dollars available in
most colleges for scholarships, loans
and jobs. Even the National Youth
Administration’s aid does not change
this percentile, although prior to
NYA, withdrawals for reasons of
financial difficulties were unques-
tionably more numerous than they
are now.

Dean Lord expresses his regret
that so many competent students aze
obliged to wiihclraw for financial
iieasons, but he points out that they
have probably beneﬁted from their

"artial college work and that they

are not “marked,” as is the case with
academic failures.

Colleges have varying gauges of
academic failure, ranging from dis-
missal fcr failing one course during
any half—term at the United States
Naval academy to systems of proba-
tion or restricted college programs
at other institutions.

Girls’ colleges and technical
schools, the survey shows, are most
hesitant about re-admitting students
previously dropped or suspended for
acaderriic shortcomings. Many col-
leges re-admit students who can
prove greater earnestness, increased
maturity or success in business-
after a year or more has elapsed
since they were detached.

And seniors will be interested to
know that one student in nine who
has survived the academic rigors for
three years will not graduate next
June.

Psychology Students Investigate
%Pcrso11ality-Energy Eorrclation

By Nancy Welfer
Are you a voluntary wall-ﬂower‘?

 to Open
Calendar Sale

Opening its annual calendar sale,
ithe YWCA offers on campus today a
icardboard calendar bearing an ink
latching of Heinz Chapel.
l These calendars are different
from last year’s which were smaller
and made of celluloid with a sketch
of the Cathedral on one side.

As usual, the price of the calen-
dar is ten cents. Copies may be ob-

ltainecl in the YWCA office, 1232
Cathedral.
In charge of the sale is Ruth

Manns, Ed40. Assisting her as calen-
dar captains: Marion Miller, Ed40;
Priscilla Dean, C40; Betty MacQueen
C41; Lenora Steele, Ed40; Betty
Cerra, Ed40; Ruth Searle, Ed40; Kay
Stultz, Ed=l-1; Pauline Yatzko, Ed39;
Regina Shipman, C40.

Each of the above girls has ten
assistants, making a total of 110
girls selling the calendar on campus.

rect exposure, latent image and its
development, and correct rendering
and scientiﬁc application of color.
Developing and printing will also be
studied.

There will be no set laboratory
Work. Typical assignments will be
to photograph certain types of sub-
jects. According. to Dr. Hutchisison,
no expensive camera or equipment
will be needed. He said a two dollar
box camera would be an adequate

tool. Probable text will be Mack
and Martin’s “The Photographic
Process.”

“The course is not for fun,” de-
clared Dr. I-Iutchisson, “but for prin-
ciples, and it is a legitimate college
course. Its purpose is to treat pho-
tography as a method of expression
just as writing is. _Many things can
be more accurately said by photos
th_a_n by words.”

He pointed out that newspapers
and magazines are emphasizing
pictures more and more, and that
the course would particularly help
science, engineering, and journalism
students. “Pictures of the project
and the progress of the work are as
an important part of engineering
data as a written report,” he said.

€’women, and Dr. Joseph H. Bar-ach,
lmedical director of the Fall»: Clinic,

on the medical aspects, and Dr. Harry
V‘-.7. Iiarn, instruct r in psychology, on
the psychological aspects.
Possible Explanation

“We feel that minor differences in
personality are due to minor differ-
ences in metabolism,” states Rosen.
“If our experiments are successful,
we believe that they will aid in per-
sonality adjustment and will lead to
a better understanding of behavior.”

Many characteristics of glandular
disturbances, causing changes in
metabolism, are already known. For
example, in hypothyroid conditions,
because of the insufﬁcient liberation
of the gland secretion into the blood
stream, metabolism is lowered and
there is a decrease of energy. The
patient displays extreme apathy, in-
diﬁerence, and sluggishness.

In hyperthyroid conditions, on the
other hand, there is an increase of
energy, and the characteristics appear
of restlessness, irritability, nervous-
ness, speedy reaction time, and to
some extent gregariousness.

‘Yes-No’ Answers

For the one part of the experiment,
the two students, who are specializ-
ing in clinical psychology, are using
th e well-standardized Neymann-
Kohlstedt Diagnostic test for Intro-
version-Extroversion, consisting of
questions to be answered “yes” or
“I10.”

Basal metabolism ‘tests for the
wo_men subjects are being conducted
now by Dr. Jamison. This is deter-
mined by the Du Bois formula, which
takes into consideration age, sex,
blood-pressure, and pulse rate. The
latter two are measured after the
subject, having had a good night’s
sleep, but no breakfast, has rested in
a prone position for 20 minutes.

Therapeutic Value

“In cases of abnormal metabolism,”
states Rosen, “we feel that modiﬁca-
tion of the physical condition with
therapy will bring about desirable
changes in personality and behavior.”

“If, because of these experiments,”
adds Rotstein, “the reader can get a
better understanding of the reasons
behind personality differences, we
will be satisﬁed.”

Fifty coeds are now being tested by
Dr. Jamison. They may obtain their
results at the conclusion of the ex-
periments.

Men students will be tested at the
Fall: Clinic after Christmas vacation.
