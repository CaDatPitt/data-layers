PAT bus hits 7

Pin student

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

A male Pitt student crossing Fifth
Avenue near the Cathedral of
Learning was struck in the leg by a
Port Authority bus yesterday.

The 7lD Hamilton passenger bus
was traveling near the Pitt Oakland
campus in the bus lane of Fifth
Avenue when it hit the student.

The victim is currently under eval-
uation at Presbyterian Hospital.

Pitt student Fred Rossi said he saw

the bus swerve around some stopped _ _

cars just before it hit the pedestrian.

University of Pittsburgh

Thursday, September 28, 1995

 

 

“There were a couple cars stopped » C C

in trafﬁc when the bus went around
them. Right after that, I saw it hit the
pedestrian,” Rossi said.

- Rossi said the bus driver immedi-
ately stopped and got out of the vehi-
cle after impact and that the victim
was on the ground near the bus lane,
screaming and clutching at his leg.

Police and witnesses said that the '

victim was struck in the leg by the
bus, and apparently the only injury
was to the victim’s ankle.

“I don’t know what he was doing,
but he was on the ground, and his
ankle was definitely hurt,” said Pitt
student Robyn Katz.

Police officer David Mack said a
concentration of officers on campus
allowed help to arrive immediately.

“This is my beat, and there were
several other officers nearby, so we
had a police and medical response
within three minutes,” Mack said.

Mack described the injury as a
crushing-type wound, where the
excessive weight of the bus com-
pressed and squeezed the affected
area, rupturing all nearby blood ves-
sels. .

Staci Vernick, spokesperson for the
Pittsburgh Port Authority, said the
pedestrian was struck by the right rear
wheel of the bus. The driver was held
off work with pay pending investiga-
tion.

“This is standard procedure until
we determine the actual cause of the
accident,” Vernick said.

Mack said this type of accident was
common on the Pitt campus before

IFC questions drinking citations

By Vicky Palombizio
For The Pitt News

Feelings of anger and frustration filled the room
Tuesday night as Pitt fraternities kicked off the
semester with their ﬁrst Inter-Fraternity Council
meeting.

Chasing rapists, catching robbers and arresting
killers —— these are just a few ways fraternity
brothers believe Pitt Police should be spending
their time. They are concemed police are devot-
ing too much time to citing minors for underage
drinking.

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd was at the meeting
to answer any questions Greeks had about enforc-
ing the alcohol law. in addition to any other con-
cems.

“I’m told that there are some people in the
Greek system that feel frustration and anger this
semester concerning [underage alcohol] citations"
written on the Hill,” Boyd said.

Boyd said that after the alcohol-related deaths
of a Pitt and then a Carnegie Mellon University
student, the chancellor called Pitt Police and
asked them to crack down on alcohol abuse and

Possible financial aid cuts alarm students

By Danielle E. Shuster
For The Pitt News

Kevin Chakos, a Pitt student from Ohio,
hopes to get into the School of Pharmacy.
Academically, he thinks he has a good
chance, but financially he may be in trouble.

If his grants are taken away or his loans
reduced, he may have to enter into a four-
year program or return to Youngstown State
University in Ohio.

Amanda Keller worries that she may have
to leave Pitt, get a job at home and go to
community college part time if her ﬁnancial
aid is reduced. .

Sean Labuda, a senior biology major, is
hoping to go to dental school. As one of ll
children, he has relied heavily upon finan-
cial aid and will need it for graduate school.

Labuda sees the proposed financial aid
cuts in a different light than some other Pitt
students.

“I think many students are misinformed.
They will continue to aid students who need
it; the problem is some don’t deserve it."
Labuda said. “The standards of who gets
into college have decreased. The govem-
ment is paying for kids who shouldn’t be
here.” -

The confusion of ﬁnancial aid has many

students scared. These fears may be
unfounded, said Mike I-lorak, press secre-
tary to Republican Senator Nancy
Kassebaum of Kansas.

“Nothing in the plan passed limits loans.
nothing limits a student’s ability to qualify
for a federal loan and nothing will increase
cost to a student currently enrolled." said
Horak.

Bosnia oigrees to shore power with Serb republic

V
ﬁg World Events

BOSNIA — After days of
negotiations. the three dueling
enemies who fought for con-
trol over Bosnia for more than

, three years — Bosnia, Croatia

and Serbian—dominated
Yugoslavia — signed a two-
page statement endorsing a
structured government in
which the Bosnian govern-
ment and its Bosnian-Croat
allies will share power with a
new Serb republic.

Although the three govern-
ments discussed peace with
hope, as well as respect for
human rights and restitution
for displaced families, they
did not agree on a cease-fire.

The continued fighting has
caused more civilians in
Bosnia to ﬂee their homes. —

SICILY — Political power-
broker Giulio Andreotti, who
served seven times as the
Italian Prime Minister, is fac-
ing charges that he secretly

_acted as political godfather

for the Sicilian Mafia. ,
The trial, which began
Monday, will examine links
between politics and orga-
nized crime in modern Italy.
Because Andreotti held
power for so long, many
Italian citizens view the case
as postwar Italian history on
trial. — The New York Times

RAMALLAH — Now that
an agreement has been
reached between Israel and
the Palestinians concerning
the West Bank city of
Ramallah, natives are wonder-
ing whether the economy will
start moving once the
Palestinians take control.

All agree that the removal
of the Israeli army patrols
along with the barbed wire
and barriers will be wel-
comed, but many question
whether life will actually
change, especially since no
one has seen the fine print of
the agreement. — The New

WASHINGTON — Senators
from both parties agreed yes-
terday that one plausible solu-
tion to the govemment’s bud-
get problems could be slow-
ing the growth of the Social
Security benefits paid to 43
million people.

The proposal is an alterna-
tive to the Republican plans to
slash projected spending on
Medicare and Medicaid, a
plan President Clinton has
made clear he would veto.

Both parties see the propos-
al as a means to reduce the

WASHINGTON — Ross
Perot announced that he will
establish a third party, stealing
some of the steam released
from political name-of-the-

The new question on the
horizon asks_if Powell will
endorse the Perot agenda and,
in turn, encase himself in a
structured campaign jaunt
across the country.

If Powell decides not to run,
or not to join Perot’s ticket,
the door is left wide open for
Perot to do the honors. Perot’s
track record tallies 19 percent

Romanian mail: champs visit campus

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

They come to America seeking a new
opportunity, the chance to continue
their education, and maybe to live life
better than their ancestors.

These people are not refugees seeking
shelter; they are world champions in the
realm of academics.

Forty-three Romanian high school
students, some of whom belong to the
country’s champion Math Olympiad
team, arrived at Pitt yesterday for the
first stop in a month-long tour designed
to introduce these students to American
colleges.

Gregory Constantine, Pitt math
department professor and Romanian
native, said this is a chance for some of
Romania’s finest students to make edu-
cational contacts in the United States.

“These students have consistently
performed in the highest levels during
worldwide academic competition, and

Pitt celebrates
Primary Care
Day

By Linda Wisniewski
Staff Writer

The university community
will come together with med-
ical students from all over the
nation today to celebrate Pitt's
second annual National
Primary Care Day.

“The purpose of itis to get
students and faculty to come
together to learn about primary
care,” said Tammy Dennis, co-

chairman of General
Physicians in Training and co-
coordinator of National
Primary Care Day.

National Primary Care Day
is held to provide information
and encourage interest in pri-
mary care careers, including-
family medicine, internal med-
icine, pediatrics and OB-GYN.

“If students want to get
hands-on experience, this is a
great opportunity,” she said.

She said that organizations
such as the Pittsburgh
Women’s Shelter, the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and
Pittsburgh AIDS Center for
Treatment, along with many
others, will hold an informa-
tion session to provide stu-
dents with possibilities of vol-
unteer work.

“We also have doctors com-
ing from each primary care
field who will be answering
questions,” she said. “People
should really come and take
advantage of that opportunity.”

Dennis said that there are a
lot of administrative changes
taking place in managed care
facilities, and it is important
for people to understand those

Pitt professor Charles Hall said he
hopes that some of these students will
consider making Pitt their home for
next year.

“These types of visits really allow us
to get close with these high—quality for-
eign students,” Hall said. “I hope that
by showing them our facilities that
some will come here for their studies.”

The Math Olympiad has been in exis-
tence since l959, and coincidentally,
the first competition was held in
Romania.

In addition to the math students, the
visiting Romanians also have physics
and science scholars in their group.
They will be visiting several major uni-
versities across the country.

“I think these students have earned a
right to make these contacts in
America,” Constantine said. “We would
be very lucky to have any of them join

Loans

°From page I

cent. put an origination fee on student
loan volume at 0.85 percent and increase
the interest rates on PLUS loans. These
changes are not final; they must go
through conference committee.

“Eliminating the six—month grace peri-
od will be hard on students. Students
who graduate will be expected to start
repaying their loans right away, which
may prove to be impossible since many
don’t have a job waiting for them,” said
Keith Campbell, member of Student
Government Board and United States
Student Association.

The direct lending program gives loans
to students from the federal government.
Students do not have to go through

banks or other institutions for the
loan,eliminating the middleman.

Capping direct lending at 20 percent
means 20 percent of federal loans can be
given through the direct lending pro-
gram.

The origination fee —— or tax, as
Democrats call it — will be an assess-
ment to universities on their student
loans. This will not affect students direct-
ly, unless universities decide to pass the
cost along to the student.

The House has proposed cutting subsi-
dized loans. Subsidized loans —— loans in
which the federal government pays the
interest rate until the student finishes
school — are safe for undergraduates
this year. However, this is not the case

for graduate students.

All loans for graduate students may
become unsubsidized. In the past, gradu-
ate students have been able to borrow
$8,500 of subsidized money and $10,000
of unsubsidized money. If the loans
become unsubsidized, graduate students
would have to pay interest on $18,500
while they are still in school.

Originally Pell Grants were to be
reduced by 7 percent. Now that number
has been cut down to only a half of a per-
cent reduction.

How many Pitt students does financial
aid effect? For the 1993-1994 academic
year there were 16,721 undergraduates
enrolled at Pitt. Of those students, 12,901
(77 percent) were eligible to apply for

ﬁnancial aid. Seventy percent of the stu-
dents who applied actually received aid.

This breaks down into
°3,695 recipients of Pell Grants
-4,414 recipients of PHEAA Grants
02,380 Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grants
-2074 Perkins Loans
07,771 Guaranteed Student Loans
(including subsidized and unsubsidized
Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans)
-1,171 College Work Study Grants.

The recipients of these awards may
receive more than one kind of award.

“Lots of hurdles still need to be
crossed before any changes occur,” said
Horak, “but there will be changes. There
must be savings."

Bulletproof Heart

directed by Mark Malone

With Anthony LaPaglia, Mimi
Rogers, Matt Craven, Peter
Boyle, Joseph Maher and
Monika Schnarre

Bulletproof Heart starts out
with all the right ingredients for
creating a film which brilliantly
blends the classic elements of
film noir with erotic, modern
twists. But somewhere along
the way, the movie loses itself.
What’s left at the end is a set
of well-developed, superbly
acted characters in an empty
framework.

lt’s not the direction that fails
this film. In his directorial
debut, Mark Malone uses all
the techniques of the film noir
genre — the shadows, the hid-
den faces, the development of
the dangerous seductress and
the hard-hearted bad boy —
coupled with the on—screen
eroticism of the modern film
age to create what could be a
fresh, spicy tribute to the cine-
ma of the past.

Nor is i the actos wh fail
this film. The cast delivers inti-
mate performances that bring

to life each and every charac- _

ter, working together so natu-
rally we almost believe these

characters are real people.

From a mere glance of their
eyes, we feel their every
heartache, fear and anxiety.
What we can’t believe, howev-
er, is their story. This is what
fails the film. Even the strong
wall of richly developed char-
acters is not enough to hide
the paper-thin storyline that
drapes the background of this
film.

The film begins with the
cold-hearted, but not evil,
assassin, Mick, played by
Anthony LaPaglia, patiently
waiting in the closet for his lat-
est victim to fall asleep. When
the job is done, Mick sits on
the bed and heaves a subtle
sigh, his face revealing a long-
ing for something more than
what he has become. Too bad
his hardened heart can't figure
out what that is. Back at home,
Mick hasn’t even got the emo-

  

tion to warm up to a sexy call
girl (Monika Schnarre) sent
from his boss George, played
by Peter Boyle, as a treat for a
job well done. Mick is spared
the hassle, however, when his
friend Archie, played by Matt
Craven, interrupts the ren-
dezvous. Edgy, nervous
Archie, sent away to Florida by
George after fumbling up a
job, has returned to beg Mick
to take him back and give him
another chance. His timing is
perfect. George has a last-
minute job for Mick to be done
that evening. V
Tonight's kill is Fiona, a mys

terious seductress played by
Mimi Rogers. She_knows they
are coming for her; in fact she
wants to die, but hasn’t had
the courage to do it herself.
She graciously welcomes Mick
into her house and then into
her bedroom. This is just the
first of many clues that this
woman has lost it. Predictably,
Fiona’s mysterious, yet psy-
chotic, nature is irresistible to
Mick. The bedroom scene is
brutally erotic, reminiscent of

  

  is . eDecI I

scenes -from Basic Instinct,
complete with a little S&M and
psychological manipulation.
Needless to say, after years
of swearing off physical and
emotional intimacy, Mick’s
heart begins to soften up; He
finds he is unable to keep him-
self from falling in love with
Fiona. -
Here the story's weakness is
exposed, as the sappy, sugary
love affair begins to ooze all
over the film. Mick violates his
own golden rule of “never hesi-
tate, never confide” and goes
as far as to give Fiona a last
request — a Chinese-food pic-
nic in the cemetery. After a
romantic interlude behind a
tombstone and a little walk
down a cemetery lane, Fiona
breaks down in an attack of
paranoia and takes refuge in a
mausoleum where she blacks
out. Instead of taking this
chance to off Fiona painlessly,
Mick feels the need to find her
a cure. He takes her to her
shrink (James Maher) to find
out what is wrong with his new
love and how he can save her.

 

TheP1avers Getmayea    

 

 

  

Mick never does get a diagno-
sis of Fiona’s condition, and
why he would want to save her
only to kill her is beyond
understanding.

Fiona regains conscious-
ness on the way to the docks
where she is to be shot, deliv-
ered to the tugboat man and
made into fish food. Mick tries
to complete his mission, but
can’t seem to pull the trigger.
When George shows up, Mick
professes his love for Fiona
and his refusal to kill her, end-
ing his struggle between loyal-
ty and desire. In the end,
Archie who has been along for
the whole ride, finds away to
prove his manhood to Mick,
taking the choice out of Mick’s
hands.

Bulletproof Heart is sup-
posed to be a moving example
of the power of love. It can
move mountains and turn ten-
der the hardened heart of an
assassin. The problem comes
in believing it can all happen in
one night.

1g's Butﬂ iii; lltfi

Anyone who has been in
Pittsburgh for a few years has
probably heard the name Kelly
Affair tossed around hither and
thither — or possibly even
walled hysterically from the
back of a smoky club. In any
respect, these past local
favorites are launching their
long-awaited debut back into
the scene with lead singer
number tour. A brief band his-
tory, not to be mistaken for a
soap opera, will lend some
insight as to what is keeping
the backbone of this band so
tight. They’ve used artistic and
even tragic setbacks to
strengthen and improve their
music and style. .

Eric Fox, bassist extraor-
dinare, and Mike Michalski,
guitarist, hooked up at the
1989 Rock Challenge, both
playing with different bands.
Although neither of them took
home the trophy, losing to
Rusted Root, they bonded
artistically and decided to start
something new. Joining talents
with drummer Jack Schmitt
and vocalist Bob Petri, they
became Kelly Affair. The suc-
cess of the band was cut short
after a year by the tragic death
of Bob on New Year’s Eve of
1991. Although the band was
pretty shaken, it tried another
round with the Affair, giving
Nick Kerr the microphone.
After a year of forcing it, they
broke up due to some artistic
differences. Jack and Mike
ventured off to Europe to do
the “Learn to Lose” tour with
the Cynics but reunited with
bassist Eric Fox in the fall of
‘92. Round three of the Kelly
Affair took off, this time with
John Bechtol as the man with

the mic.

John Bechtol, Eric Fox, Mike
Michalski and Jack Schmitt
made up the Kelly Affair for the
following two years. Fox
describes this as “the most
successful we ever where. But
success for a local band is
when you don’t have to pay for
your strings anymore or your
rehearsal space.” The band
won the ‘93 Hard Hitters and
the Rock n’ Roll Reporter
Competition, which boosted
their success. They werealso

.turning some heads for a

record contract at this time.
Everything came to a stop,
however, when John Bechtol
and the remaining Kelly Affair
parted ways.

After seven months of prac-
tice, auditions, and an attempt
to reestablish the band identity

as Honeyburst, and auditions,

t ey unite wit t e new man
on stage, John Schishler.
From there they decided to
reverse their reactionary deci-
sion to change the name and
stuck with the “Beyond the
Valley of the Dolls” spin-off ——
The Kelly Affair.

Following my private.show-
ing in the Kelly Affair practice
space located in the Strip
District, I had a chance to talk
to the guys about what we can
expect from their debut this
Friday at Nick’s Fat City. “The
material we have will be crush-
ing,” described Schmitt. The
band was supposed to make
its debut about a month ago at
a Riverplex show but canceled
due to John’s strep throat. ‘‘I
have more to prove than these
guys do, and I didn’t want to
do it half—assed.” From the pre-
view I received, I’m preparing

myse or an excitingy over-
whelming and powerful perfor-
mance.

Fox described the changes
in the Kelly Affair by saying,
“We are still the same people,
so it’s three-quarters of the
same vision — just a continua-
tion of that vision.” They are
writing songs now as a band
and practice four to five times
a week. After debating about
doing the old stuff, they’ve
decided to stick to the new
material. With all the practicing
and writing together, the music
flows more naturally. “We just
want it to be second nature
and feel totally organic,”

-described Jack and John. “The

band is"‘mo‘re melodic now,
and I think people will walk
away singing what John
sings,” suggested Jack.
Comparing what I've heard

live in the practice space with
Schishler to the former Kelly
Affair, I have to agree. The
notes are not as blended, and
it sounds like focused singing.
John attributes the changes in
the band to “being genuine, we
don’t put on airs. I really care if
people dig our music, but
when people say they hate us,
I get a charge out of that too.”
The band is prepared to do
what comes naturally. The
image John Bechtol illuminat-
ed from the stage by using
candles, flowers and paint is
not them anymore. “I’m not an
actor, and none of us are
actors. We’re not going to go
out there and fake lt," stated
Fox. “We actually don’t know
what the next thing is until the
sparks start. I don’t know what
I want ‘till I see it,” added Jack.
From the taste of the band I
got, I suspect it will have no
problem establishing itself
again. They are all very unique
and even more talented. If an
image is what they need, then
their sex appeal (some more
androgynous than others)
should appease most crowds.
Their first show as the new
and improved Kelly Affair will
be this Friday, Sept. 29, at
Nick’s Fat City on the South
Side. They are playing with the
funk/jazz/rock stars of Java
Bean. This will be an early
show, so get there before 10
p.m. You can also catch them
either Oct. 14 at the Electric
Banana or Oct. 31 at Cloud
Nine — Halloween Night. But,
don ’t miss this “perfect mixture
of chaos and order” at Nick’s
this Friday with the new Affair.

  THIS   NTA
RICE

Bridge Tavern hosts an Igor
Records Extravaganza and
homage: The Minimalist Love Gods
CD release party and the Vivian
Stanshall Memorial Orchestra.

The Love Gods celebrate their
second release, Devolver. Between
the two of them, members Rob
Rayshich and Ed Boytin somehow
pull off a full-band sound and multi-
tracks aren't the only secret. This
pleasingly quirky, poppy, (bitter-)
sweet duo is so honest on stage
you want to kiss them on the cheek.

The Vivian Stanshall Memorial
Orchestra is an innovative collabo-
ration of Minimalist Love Gods,
Blogurt, Bone of Contention, and
Indecision members. Vivian himself
was the singer for the Bonzo Dog
Band, a mock-'20s jazzlrock band
with Monty Python-esque Dadaist
humor. He was killed in a fire in
London last March. Comprised of
three clarinets, bassoon, sax, gui-
tar, bass, and drums, the memorial
orchestra plays scores transcribed
from Bonzo Dog Band records.

That's The Minimalist Love Gods
CD release party with the Vivian
Stanshall Memorial Orchestra at the
BBT, Saturday, 10 PM. Over 21.

Jawbreaker

Dear You
DGC

When I looked through the
pile of CDs to review, the first
one that got any reaction was
Jawbreaker’s Dear You. “Ah,” I
thought, “this should be easy. I
like Jawbreaker.” Then I lis-
tened to it. Yeah, well, it's not
all bad, but it sure doesn't
measure up to their prior
efforts. ’

My first Jawbreaker experi- .
ence was last year at WPTS. I
found a 12" ep called
Chesterfield King. It was all
good —— just noisy enough,
rockin’ with sing-a-long melod-
ic hooks, but not so weak as to
be pop. I really got into their
use of dynamics and Blake
Schwarzenbach’s raspy,
cracking voice. This summer, I
bought more albums and start-
ed to notice a slightly annoying
trend to poppiness. I guess it
shouldn’t have surprised me
that Dear You continues logi-
cally in this progression, espe-
cially since it’s on DGC and,
not the Tupelo Communion
label.

The leadoff track on the disc,
“Save Your Generation,” gets
the album rolling in
Jawbreaker’s apparent new
style: commercial straight-
ahead punk rock, a la many
late-breaking California punk
bands. ‘‘I Love‘-.‘You So Much
It’s Killing Us Both” sounds
slightly angry, but not nearly
angry enough. “Lurker ||”
sounds like Green Day cov-
ered by a cancer patient.
Indeed, some of the tracks on I
this disc are just plain losers. |

Why? Musically, much of!
Jawbreaker’s comp|exity'
seems lacking. Drum fills are '
sparse. Guitar tracks, which I
previously featured overdubs |
and dissonance, are now I
straight rhythmic strumming. It I
just sounds really produced. In
fact, it sounds overproduced. A
consequence of DGC? I don’t |
know. The album that preced— I
ed this (on Tupelo) was fairly I
clean-sounding as well. This.
album, however, is strangled. j,
The vocals suffer especially. I j
loved Chesterfield King and .I
Bivouac so much because, I

 

fact

despite the that
Schwarzenbach couIdn’t sing,
he damn sure was trying his
best to make up for talent with
emotion. Now he just rasps
quietly in a monotone, never
exploding the tension the band
or lyrics create.

Right now, you’re probably
asking yourself why I said the
album wasn’t all bad. It’s
because some tracks redeem
the album, tracks that show
that Jawbreaker has not for-
gotten completely what makes
it tick.

“Accident Prone” features
tonal contrast, with sweet-
sounding guitars held just a
few dB away from full fuzz
howl. On the refrains, the vio-
lent emotions come out and
the band blows ' up.
Dissonance, unique cues, a
nicely voiced bridge’ and full-
throated hits make the song
rock.

“Million” continues in the
same vein, using tempo
changes, dynamic tricks and
voicing to drive the point
home. One of the emotions
Jawbreaker is best at is wistful
longing, and this song delivers
it in spades both sonically and
lyrically. It makes me feel bad
for them, it’s that good."

- Finally, “Jet Black” does all
this and more, with perhaps
the best lyrics of all the songs

and movie dialogue samples. ‘

The band depresses you, then
takes you through catharsis. If
the end of a relationship could
be a song, this would be it.

But three good tracks do -not

the whole album for highlights,
it’s possible to be fooled into
thinking the whole thing is just
OK. But just one song from a

makes it clear that this album

The Grassy Knoll
Antilles

I don’t know much about
“acid jazz,” but I think that this
may be a mock version of it —
it’s definitely not RPM. Okay,
well maybe not acid jazz,
rather it’s ambient with a sax.
An annoying sax.

I was casually perusing the
two trance albums available in

the so-called “techno-rave”
section at the electro-deficient
local hipster music store and
Grassy Knoll is what I came
across with curious interest. I
listened to it. Twisty. Noisy.
Nuisance. These musicians
obviously never made first
chair in high school. I could
give them the benefit of the
doubt and say that their sound
is experimental, while scholas-
tically rubbing my chin and
staring reflectively into my
speakers. But I won’t. Its a
quirky, qworksy admixture of
natural instruments, a mixer,
some turntables and, thank
God, no vocals. Put this all
together and you get weird
stuff and a headache.

I don’t know. Although

Grassy Knoll is almost purely
experimental mojo-crap, there
is a certain nauseating nostal-

5 _‘_,

 

gia about it that makes me feel
as though I've been here
before and left immediately.
And that sax! Get it outta here!
It jaggedly flutters around like
a maimed_butterfIy in every
song. “The Beauty Within,”
which consisted of background
brimstone screaming, accom-
panied by electro-helicoptic
choppiness, averted my atten-
tion back to the stereo. (That
was the good song.)

This album left a bad taste in
my ears. After 30 minutes of
listening, I was screaming and
droolingfor my temporarily
possessed stereo to shut the
hell up, and I wasn’t even in a
bad mood. If you happen to
pick up The Grassy Knoll,

throw in a box of Excedrin _

along with it.

Diary of a Madman?

The Washington Post and
The New York Times faced an
ethical dilemma. Should they
publish the text of a serial

1. bomber in exchange for his

promise that he would not kill

* anyone in the future? Was the

decision to publish giving in to
a madman, or was it printing a

«newsworthy item while at the -

same time performing a public
service?
That dilemma was resolved,

, at least on the surface, last

week when The Post pub-
lished the entire manifesto as
an 8-page supplement. Since

' then, The Post has been bom-

barded with requests for extra
copies, and by the Sept. 24, it
had run out of copies, accord-

ing to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

The manifesto was pub-
lished at the recommendation
of the FBI. The hope on the
part of the press is that this will
help to stop the killings. The
FBI hopes that it will gain
some leads, but the ethical
questions involved go much
deeper than this. The freedom
and integrity of the press are
stake. 5

The two extremes in thought
about publishing the manifesto
range from not publishing it,
which one might accuse the
The New York Times of doing
by leaving it to The Post, to
publishing it and offering the
bomber regular media access,
as in the case of Bob
Guccione. Guccione offered to
publish the Unabomber uncen-

sored in the pages of
Penthouse magazine. In a let-
ter to Guccione, the
Unabomber said that FC did
not want to publish in
Penthouse because it was an
entertainment magazine and
wasn’t considered
“respectable.” Despite this, the
Unabomber agreed to let
Penthouse publish it The
Times and The Post refused.
However, the deal was differ-
ent — the Unabomber
resen/ed the right to “plant one
(and only one) bomb intended
to kill," after the manuscript
had been published
(Penthouse, October 1995).
The FBI has claimed that
this is the first time the
Unabomber has tried to
explain why he bombs people
ranging from timber industry
lobbyists to computer store
owners. Yet, in an exclusive to
Penthouse, the Unabomber
claims that in 1985, FC sent a
letter to The San Francisco
Chronicle explaining its
motives. FC’s theory was that
the FBI stopped its publication.
In the excerpts from the same
letter that FC provided to

Presented by Pittsburgh Symphony Society, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and PACE Theatrical Group.

Guccione, they explain that FC
stands for “Freedom Club,”
and describe their group as
being “apolitical. Politics only
distracts from the real issue.”

In terms of integrity of the
press, what publishing the
Unabomber text means is turn-
ing over the press to a murder-
er. Printing his manifesto turns
him from a murderer into a rev-
olutionary. Allowing him to
publish his views this way sets
a bad precedent. Publishing
excerpts, as The Times did on
Aug. 2 of this year, is only
valuable as it relates to the
story. The New York Times
claims that this was its motive
in publishing them, yet it
looked suspiciously like an
effort to meet the Unabomber
halfway.

The text should have been
available to those who were
interested in seeing it. It is now
on the Internet, which must
make a Luddite like the
Unabomber gnash his teeth.
That probably ought to have
been the first place it was‘
released. Alternately, The

- Times and The Post could

have made it available to those

’ who wanted to write in and pay

a fee to cover the costs.

The manifesto was clearly of
interest to some. Not only has
The Post run out of copies, but
The Oakland Tribune, in
response to reader requests,

‘ has reprinted the text in

response to reader requests.
There wasn’t a copy of The
Post to be found on the news-
stands in Oakland by about
midday the day it was printed.
It may not have been the kind
of exposure the bomber want-
ed, but acceding to terrorists’.
demands and publishing their

I 5  platforms is not the job of the

press. The media is also not a
tool for the federal government
to get information about citi-
zens.

The role of the FBI in all of
this has been unclear at best.

The final printing decision was
made with the “recommenda-
tion” of FBI.

Time magazine reports that
different professors had
received copies of the mani-
festo in the hopes that they
might be able to provide some
clues to the identity of the
Unabomber. One professor
said that the FBI was “fanati-
cal” that it not be released. The
FBI was worried about the
investigation receiving false
tips. A final concern has been
that the Unabomber might
actually convince someone to
engage in sabotage.

The one constant in this
whole situation is that the
Unabomber’s text should be
available to those who are
interested in it. It is important
to have access to dissenting
ideas in order for a free
exchange of ideas to occur.
Luddites and technophiles
alike both have a stake in what
he has to say. Those of us
caught in between must pay
attention to this debate,
because as technology
increasingly shapes our world,
we need information to decide
what effects we want it to
have.

With that in mind, the press
has an obligation to avoid
manipulation in this and all
other matters. Whether it is the
government, big business or
terrorists, there are groups
who will try to shape the world
by manipulating the press. The
press must give the people
accurate information so that
we have the power to control
our environments.

Kiss of the Spider Woman
directed by Harold Prince

at the Benedum Center,
downtown

Pittsburgh gets a taste of
mainsteam avant-garde with
The Kiss Of The Spider
Woman’s clever interpretation
of Argentina’s political turmoil
in the late '70s and early '80s.
Despite the obvious glamour
a show of this size presents,
there is a mysterious mes-
sage also being portrayed. I
found out through an exclu-
sive interview with Juan
Chioran (who plays Molina)
that the context of the script
furthers the political theme by
exposing Pittsburgh's conser-
vative crowds to liberal ideas.

When I asked Chioran what
a show of this size has to
offer Joe College, he told me
the message being portrayed
will challenge and expose the
audience to politically
charged moments in
Argentian culture. Chioran
said that through the per-
spective of his character,
Molina, you can-understand
other incidents in the world
where the people are in politi-
cal exile.

“This isn't about fluff, and
we don’t try to present it in a
fluffy context. Although this
piece may make people
uncomfortable, it touches
them and makes them look at
that part of themselves that
they may not understand,”
said Chioran.

Chioran said he can some-

squirming in their seats at
explicit scenes. Molina’s
balls-out homosexuality will
be hard-hitting for most of the
highbrow Benedum crowd.
“The show breaks into those
ideas of an audience seeking
pure enjoyment in homosexu-
ality.”

Prisoners of conscience
were tortured and killed in
Argentina’s overcrowded pris-
ons. Molina pronouces,
“Deaf, dumb, and blind, Mr.
Revolutionary sir!” saying that
sometimes you’ve got to turn
a cheek to chaos and pain to
survive. Molina finds later it
is inpossible to stay immune
to political involvment when it
resides close to home.

Dorian Harewood, best
known for his part in ‘‘Full
Metal Jacket” and “Roots:
The Next Generation,” was
also on hand hamming it up
with a full schedule of inter-
viewers. Later that night I
experienced the famed
Broadway. Chioran’s perfor-
mance with Harewood was
impressive and hard-hitting.
Chita Rivera’s presence
heightened the performance
with glamour, but Harewood’s

' performance of Valentin, the
imprisoned political leader,
kept the audience focused on
the underlying seriousness.

The show runs at the
Benedum Center till Sunday,
Oct. 1. For ticket information
call 456-6666. Tickets are
$40. Each.

the guard rails were put up on

Dennis said that many peo-
ple are going to hospital emer-
gency rooms when there is no
urgency to their problem. She
said that to stop this from hap-
pening, insurance providers are
starting to crack down on the
system.

“Within the next two years,
you will need your doctor’s
permission beforegyou can go
to the emergency room,” she
said. “Everyone will need to
have a family doctor.”

“This is really going to open
up positions in the primary
care field.” Dennis said.
“Primary care physicians are
going to start serving as gate-
keepers.”

All events of the day are
scheduled to take place on the
fourth floor of Scaife Hall.
Besides the information ses-
sion that will take place from
11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., there
will be two lectures.

Dr. Richard Steinman, co-
founder of the Rainbow Clinic,
will speak at noon on commu-
nity opportunities available to
medical students. Also, Dr.
Barbara Barnes will ‘deliver the
Key Note speech at 4:30 p.m.

Opinions
Dump the curfew

Pittsburgh City Councilman Joe Cusick, rejuvenated from his
trip to the Big Easy, is back in the ‘Burgh, and he’s got teen cur-
few on his mind.

Cusick studied the teenage curfew in New Orleans and figured
that if it works for them, it will work for us. Not so fast, Joe.

He’s calling the plan the “parental responsibility ordinance.”
Sounds nice and peachy, but it seems Cusick did not bring com-
mon sense into his plan.

The curfew calls for minors 16 and under to be accompanied by

.. an adult after 10 p.m. during the school year and after ll p.m.

during the summer. Failure to comply will result in stiff penalties,
including a maximum $300 fine and 100 hours of community ser-
vice.

What Cusick fails to realize is that this curfew can hurt more
then it helps._What about 14-, 15- and 16-year-olds who are work-
ing at the local burger joint until midnight? What if you’re
babysitting on a Friday night, and you have to ride your bike
home at l a.m.? '

In addition, this curfew will likely result in more rebellion from
teenagers. Just like drinking alcohol and smoking pot, they will
disobey the law because they can.

Maybe Cusick and his buddies should stop taking trips to the
Mardi Gras headquarters and worry about their own village.
Maybe instead of focusing on every teenager, they could concen-
trate their laws and regulations on. the gangs that are destroying
our streets.

  Save Americorps

One of President Clinton’s only programs that has actually
worked, Americorps, was voted down by the Senate earlier in the
week. It was a close call, falling 52-47. I

This is too bad. The program enables students to payoff school
loans, or sometimes to pay for schools while also volunteering in
needy areas across the country. It’s kind of like a national Peace
Corps. _

The Senate voted down a bill that would have restored $425
million to fund the program (New York Times, Sept. 27). Some
senators say the ﬁght isn’t over, because this is just a small part of
an overall bill that President Clinton will likely veto.

This program is only two years old, andwhile it deﬁnelty is not
ﬂawless, it deserves a better chancetto succeed. When working
properly it can kill two birds with one stone — college -students
can begin to pay back their enormous debts, and -some of the
problems of America’s inner cities can receive more attention.

This has been an on-going act in the Senate — cut, out, cut.
While The Pitt News supports the efforts of both parties to bal-
ance the budget and reduce the federal deﬁcit, there has to be a
point where these politicians stop and look at what they are

' destroying.

Fitness center

I am writing in response to the
editorial in the Sept. 27 edition of
The Pitt News entitled “Finish
Lothrop Gym,” for the purpose
of clarifying any misunderstand-
ings left by the article.

First, on behalf of the Ofﬁces
of Student and Public Affairs,
Business and Finance, the
Provost and the School of
Education -— all of which are
cooperatively involved in the
planning and construction of the
Student Fitness Center in Lothrop
— I want to assure our student
community that the university’s
commitment to this project is
ﬁrm. Second, the project is mov-
ing ahead, in spite of some

unavoidable delays due to obliga-_

tions to follow required bidding
procedures. Further, we now
anticipate that actual construction
will begin within 10 days and that
the order for new equipment for
the center has been placed. At the
outset, we now anticipate the cen-
ter will be fully operational no
later than the‘ beginning of

January, and possibly before the

end of the current tenn.

Further, it should be under-
stood that the new Student
Fitness Center — though more
widely publicized — is only one
element of a larger investment
the university is making in stu-
dent recreation. At Trees Hall, for
example, the university will be
expending additional funds to
increase the number of hours that
facility will be open, for the pur-
chase of additional aerobic exer-
cise equipment, to open a stu-
dent-operated equipment lending
service and to add the new sport
of Wallyball.

We believe this combined
investment in expanding recre-
ational opportunities for our stu-
dents, even though the cost is
slightly more than originally pro-
jected, is a wise one, and one

made with the goal of improving
the quality of student life as the
paramount consideration. V

The Lothrop Fitness Center
will be a beautiful facility and
one in which students can take
pride in helping to accomplish.
We ask your patience and under-
standing during the next several
months.

Leon L. Haley
Vice Chancellor for Student
and Public Affairs

Pitt highly ranked

Good news is always welcome
— there is precious little of it. So
we can all take pride in the stellar
ranking of Pitt’s Philosophy
Department, second in the nation
according to the latest National
Research Council assessment
(“Pitt philosophy ranks high,”
The Pitt News, Sept. 26). But
there is more very good news that
somehow slipped past your
reporter’s notice. The Department
of History and Philosophy of
Science is ranked fifth among the
72 evaluated philosophy depart-
ments. What makes this all the
more remarkable is that the
Department of HPS is not evena
pure philosophy of science. Thus,
Pitt has two of the country’s top
ﬁve philosophy departments. We

hope the News’ readers will cele-.

brate this further item of good
news!

Justice for Mumia

Anyone looking into the
Mumia Abu-Jamal case quickly
discovers that there is an over-
whelming amount of evidence on
the public record proving that Mr.
Jamal did not have a fair trial. We
are shocked that your editorial of

Sept. 13, which calls for the exe-
cution of Mr. Jamal, makes no
effort whatsoever to engage with
or refute any of this evidence. It
does not even acknowledge that
any of it exists. Instead, and in
characteristic fashion, the evi-
dence it does cite for its own
bloodthirsty position is riddled
with errors and falsehoods.

We condemn your editorial as a
dishonest and vicious piece of
journalism. This is not a debating
game. Life, death and the moral
foundations of our society are at
stake. Your brand of journalism
has very serious consequences.
Since Mr. Jamal did not have a
fair trial, since you feel no obliga-
tion to provide reasonable argu-
ment otherwise, your call for his
execution adds your voice to all
the other vicious voices in our
society calling for the rule of
lynch law.

Dorseﬂ finds his home at corne

*)\II\\\‘.\'-!\‘.\\.\ \ \ \ I . . trill, . . . . . . . \ \\_
~»-\'\,~~x  »..e.......\..,_,_

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

During 1992, he played special teams, a little
linebacker and cornerback.
During 1993, he moved to wide.receiver after

_ starting the year at cornerback.

During 1994, he once again moved to cornerback.

Earlier this season, head coach Johnny Majors
said he wished he would have been here one year
sooner to see what this guy could do at running
backj

The position shuffling is over now, and Anthony
Dorsett Jr. has settled in as Pitt’s starting right cor~
nerback.

“He’s home,” said Pitt defensive back coach Tony

Pierce. .

With Denorse Mosley out with an ankle injury,
Dorsett has been catapulted into the position of
coveringithe opponents’ top receiver.

“When Denorse went down, Anthony and John
Jenkins have been the glue in this secondary,”
Pierce said. I

The 5-foot—ll, l90—pound Aliquippa native has
responded with his best season to date, despite suf-
fering a hip pointer against Eastern Michigan and

several instances of leg cramps against the Texas‘

Longhorns.

Through the first four games this year, Dorsett
has compiled 16 unassisted tackles (including eight
last week against Ohio State) and three assisted
tackles. for a total of 19 tackles, which is second
among defensive backs to Jenkins’ 24 tackles.

Dorsett leads the team with four passes broken up
and is tied with Jenkins for the team lead with two
interceptions.

“He’s been knocking the ball down, and his play
has improved,” said Pierce. “But there’s room for
improvement, and we definitely haven’t seen the
best of him, yet.” *

 I-A--STUDENT
GVERNMENT

    

Dorsett’s two picks this season both came last
week against the Buckeyes, and they were the first
two picks of his college career. Both came in the
first half of Pitt’s 54-14 blowout loss, with one tak-
ing away what could have been an Ohio State
touchdown. At halftime, Pitt only trailed by six.

“Right now, Dorsett has that attitude that he’ll

i make the big play,” Pierce said.

Last fall, Dorsett started to make big plays. He
emerged as the starting right cornerback following
the third game against Ohio Stateand performed

‘ solidly for the remainder of the year.

Dorsett registered 33 total tackles, recovered a
fumble against Boston College and was second on
the team with seven passes broken up.

His best performance as a Panther may have been
last year in the»Panthers near—upset of the Miami
(Fla.) Hurricanes. He registered eight tackles
(seven solo) and deflected three passes against the
vaunted Hurricane receivers.

During Dorsett’s sophomore season, former
coach Paul Hackett decided to utilize Dorsett’s
blazing speed and 38.5-inch vertical leap as a
receiver, because of several injuries to other Pitt
players. .

Mostly, Dorsett played special teams that year.

He entered Pitt in 1991 as the most notable Pitt
football player since his father, Heisman Trophy
winner Tony Dorsett, even though Anthony played
only one year of high school football at J .J . Pierce
High School in Texas, where he played defensive
back and wide receiver. He was selected Dallas
Morning News Player of the Week and earned All-
District honorable mention honors.

“It had to be a hassle for him coming here,”
Pierce said. “But he’s handled everything very well,
and he continues to handle everything very well.”

In high school, Dorsett also lettered three years in
track, a sport he participates in at Pitt.

After playing linebacker and receiver early in his

- career at Pitt, Dorsett has developed into one of

the conference’s best cornerbacks.

Princeton, Dorsett won the 55—meter dash in the
time of 6.28 seconds. He also was a member of
Pitt’s winning 400—meter relay team at the 1995 Big
East Outdoor Track Championships, along with
football teammates Jay Jones and Dietrich J ells.

Tennis and volleyball conquer Penguins OSU

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

The depth of Pitt’s women tennis team paid off in its match
against the Youngstown State Penguins last night, as the Lady
Panthers won 5-2.

"We were solid from one through six. They were solid in at the
top. and then they dropped off,” head coach George Dieffenbach
said.

The match started off with Pitt picking up its first point of the
day on doubles. after taking two of three matches from the Lady
Penguins. 5

The pair of Erin Shalbrack and Jen Bible defeated Allison Gatta
and Amy Garchar 8-3, and the No. 3 team of Alison Baker and
Kristen Siegel won 8-1 over Kristy Zagotta and Corey Ingham.

“It was important to get the doubles point,” Dieffenbach said.
“It’s a psychological boost going into the singles matches.”

The No. 1 team of Fran Davis and Marla Zielinski lost a close
match to Santi Nalluri and Amy Garchar by a score of 8-6.

“Davis and Zielinski played well against two very fine players,"
Dieffenbach said. “Nalluri is one of the best players in the
Midwest, and Hall is a fine player out of Canada. They are a solid
team, and [Davis and Zielinski] almost beat them. It was a close
match.”

In singles action, Nalluri and Hall notched the only points of the
day for YSU.

Nalluri beat Shabrack in straight sets 6-1, 6-1, but it was a much

It was an entire team effort last night as the Pitt Lady
Panthers volleyball team swept host Youngstown State in
three games, 15-5, 15-9, 15-4. g

Coach Cindy Alvear said, “I’m happy that everyone played
so very, very well tonight. As a team we hit over .300, which
is great.”

The Lady Panthers were once again led by Jennie Driscoll,
who had 10 kills and hit .348 on the evening. Freshman
Annemarie Tarara continued playing well, as she had nine
kills against the Lady Penguins. '

Jill Raslevich led Youngstown State with eight kills. while
Amy Herman added seven. Jaime Pirotte hit .667 for the
Lady Penguins. -

Youngstown State came into the match with a 10-2 record,
but hit only .067, and the Lady Panthers proved to be too
much for them to handle. ‘

“We were clearly the stronger team on the court tonight,”
Alvear said. “Just like in the match last Saturday against
American, we came out aggressive. We took care of business
and got out of there.”

The Lady Panthers used a few new looks in the win over
YSU. Freshmen Tara Haefner and Jessica Van Der Maille
each saw action at new positions. Coach Alvear was pleasant-
ly surprised with their performance.

some firsts.

Majors and Co. are in
search of their first win since
the 66-30 whipping of
Eastern Michigan." They are
also looking to beat the
Hokies for the first time since
Tech joined the Big Least in
1993. That year, Tech gained
675 yards of total offense,
including 500 on the ground,
in the 63-21 win. Tailback
Dwayne Thomas led the
Hokies with 170 yards on 19
carries and scored twice.

The game was overby half-

_ time, as the Hokies scored 42

points in the first half. Those
42 points tied a school record
set in 1920 when Tech beat
Emory & Henry 75-6.

Last year, Pitt traveled to
Blacksburg, Va., and came
home with a 45-7 loss.
Thomas led the way for the
Hokies again with 82 yards
on 14 carries and two scores.
Antonio Freeman also
returned a punt 70 yards for a
TD.

The Panther’s circus of
QBs —— Ryan, Gonzalez and
Fitzgerald —— combined for a
pitiful 130 yards passing. On
the ground, the Panthers
gained only 128 yards.

Last week Pitt played well
against Ohio State for one
half, but got outscored 35-0
in the second half. The
Buckeyes held Pitt to 284
yards total offense on the day,
and John Ryan threw three
interceptions.

The Hokies beat Miami last
week 13-7 and knocked the
‘Canes out of the Top 25 for
the first time since 1985.
Thomas rushed for 165 yards
on 24 carries and scored once
on a 1-yard run. As at team,
Tech gained 300 yards on the
ground.

Virginia Tech enters the
game a two-point favorite
over Pitt. Usually we have
the Tale of the Tape at this
point in the column, but Ohio
State used up all the tape last
week with their 54 points and
636 total yards. This week we
have something new, some-
thing you’ve never seen from

Virginia Tech quaterbclck
hopes to pick up where
his predecessor left off

By Mike Kovak

Asst. Sports Editor

The 1-2 Virginia Tech Hokies will have a new quarterback look from last sea-
son when they enter Pitt Stadium at noon on Saturday to play the Panthers.
Hokies to 63-21 and 45-7

Gone is quarterback Maurice DeShazo, who led the
victories over Pitt the last two sea- -~
sons.

“They were very unpleasant games
to be associated with, because
frankly, they mauled us. They
whipped us every way we could be ‘
whipped,” said Pitt head coach ’
Johnny Majors.

The last two seasons, DeShazo also
led the Hokies to two bowl appear-
ances, including last year’s 45-23
loss to the Tennessee Volunteers in
the Gator Bowl. The Hokies ﬁnished
second in the Big East last year with
a 9-4 record.

DeShazo set the all-time Hokie
marks for career total offense with
6,105 yards and touchdown passes
with 47.

The new Tech signal caller is Jim 
Druckenmiller.

Although Druckenmiller will not
be a proliﬁc passer like DeShazo, the ..
Hokie coaching staff thinks the 6-
foot-4, 220-pound dropback passer
can do many of the same things.

“We run basically about the same
number of plays, just some plays we
run a little more of and some plays
we run a little less. But it is basically
the same type of offense,” said Hokie

 

Last season, Druckenmiller saw
limited duty. He completed 10 of 20
passes for 75 yards, one touchdown
and one interception.

This season, Druckenmiller has struggled. Through three games, he has com-
pleted 46 percent of his passes (42-_9l) for 528 yards, one touchdown and three
interceptions. He ranks last in the Big East Conference in passing efficiency.

After coming under fire for Tech’s opening losses against Boston College and
Cincinnati, the critics were silenced by Tech’s stunning 13-7 upset victory over

the Miami Hurricanes last Saturday.

“He took some criticism and people were down on him, but he hung in there,
had a great week of practice and came out playing very well,” Beamer said.

Beamer credits the victory over Miami to the lack of Hokie turnovers and
penalties. Virginia Tech hadn’t beat the Hurricanes in 13 previous tries, and it was

Miarni’s ﬁrst loss to an unrarrked opponent since 1984.

“They will probably be coming in here with an extreme amount of conﬁdence,

What a week for the Panthers to lose two starting offensive linemen.
In last week’s game against Ohio State, center Reggie Thomas and tackle Tony Oriandini left

will probably be out indeﬁnitely,” coach
Johrmy Majors said “The assessments do not
sound good”

Making the trip up to Pitt Stadium from
Blacksburg, Va, is the Big East’s No. l and
the nation’s No. 2 rushing defense. It’s a
defense that held Miami to only 51 yards
mshing last week, as the Hokies downed the
‘Canes 13-7. On the season, they are only
giving up 66.3 yards a game on the ground

“[V1rginia Tech] is leading in rushing
defense. They are leading in scoring defense.
Those are two great places to be number
one,” Majors said

On the bus will be the Big East
Defensive Player of the Week, J .C. Price. He
had nine tackles, two assists and forced a
fumble. He also had seven quarterback hur-
nes.

There is also perhaps the conference’s
best defensive end in Cornell Brown.
Ruben’s little brother. Brown leads Tech’s
linemen with 27 tackles.

“Comell has been playing excellent,”
Hokie head coach Frank Beamer said “He is
a real player, just like Ruben was. Cornell is
alsoaguywhomeansalottoourdefense.”

Stepping in for the Panthers to take on
Brown and Price are center Tim Glass and
tackle Tim Robbins.

Virginia Tech runs to victory over Hurricanes

By Mark Wolff
Sports Editor

Editor's note: Mark Wolf)‘ is the sports editor for
the Collegiate Times, the Virginia Tech student
newspaper.

Somewhere Vince Lombardi must have
approved the Virginia Tech game plan against the
University of Miami Saturday. To the man who
once said, “football is a running game, first and
foremost,” a plan designed around execution
from talented running backs and an offensive line
opening holes helicopters could land in would
havevbeen just the right prescription.

For the Hokies, this translated into a staggering
300 yards rushing.

For the Hurricanes, it translated to a 13-7
defeat. ‘

The first 11 plays from scrimmage were runs
totalling 62 yards.

At the end of the first quarter, the statistics
showed a 14-1 pass-run ratio for the Hokies.

This is all coming against the team that a year
ago was the seventh-ranked defense against the

run. A big part of that national ranking came
when Miami held Tech to -14 yards on the
ground en route to a 24-3 win against the Hokies.

Part of the difference between this year and last
was the control of Miami linebacker Ray Lewis.

' While Lewis’ statistics show 15 tackles and a

sack on the day, he was effectively held in check
and was unable to make the big plays he is
accustomed to making. _

“He’s a great player, probably the best we’ll
play all year,” assistant head coach and running
backs coach Billy Hite said. “We concentrated on
trying to block him. [Center] Billy Conaty did a
great job. He blocked him the majority of the
day.”

This attack was a team effort, with each mem-
ber earning his share of the success.

“The holes the offensive line opened up
seemed like a Mack truck could go through
them,” Thomas said. “Our offensive line was
hyped up.” -

Another key to the game was the blocking of
fullbacks Brian Edmonds and Marcus Parker.

“Every time I looked up [Edmonds] was in the
secondary clearing out linebackers,” Thomas

said.

“Number one, the offensive line did a great
job,” Hite said. “Number two, Edmonds and
Parker did a great job.” ’

The average per attempt on the day was 6.1
yards. The total marked the first time since Sept.
25, 1993, against Maryland that Tech reached the
300-yard mark.

The Hokie tailbacks combined for 247 yards.
Sophomore Ken Oxendine tallied 82 of them in
his first game back from a fractured bone in his
hand. But the biggest star of the afternoon was
Thomas.

Thomas rolled up 165 yards, seven shy of his
career high. Four times Thomas broke into the
Miami secondary for gains of 15 yards or more,
including a 39-yard burst in the second quarter.

“We wanted to run ‘Ox,’ but Thomas was so
hot today,” Hite said. “I stayed with him for most
of the day.” _

For Thomas, there were personal reasons
behind his performance Saturday.

“We’ve lost to this team three years in a row,”
Thomas said. “This is my last one, so this was
kind of a going away present for me."

Virginia Tech gains confidence after beating Miami

By Bill Ray

Associate Sports Editor

Editor's note: Bill Ray is the
Associate Sports Editor for the
Collegiate Times, the Virginia
Tech student newspaper.

After weathering the
Hurricanes of Miami, the Hokies
must not rest on their laurels, as
they begin an arduous road
schedule playing the University
of Pittsburgh Panthers.

The painful memories of 12
consecutive losses since 1953 and
being outscored 45-5 in their last
two meetings were erased last
Saturday when Tech defeated the
Miami Hurricanes, 13-7. The
game marked only the second
time Miami had been beaten by a
Big East opponent and dropped
the ‘Canes unceremoniously from
the polls.

“I think what this win does,”
Tech head coach Frank Beamer
said, “it gives us an opportunity
to get right back into the thick of
the Big East race.”

The Panthers currently have the
top offense in the Big East and

are a far cry from the team that
the Hokies have manhandled in
their previous two meetings,
outscoring the Panthers 108-28.
Thus far this season, quarter-
back John Ryan is leading the Big
East in total yardage, having
racked up 942 yards in the air,
despite being picked off 11 times.
“‘We have just got to get to
him,” Big East Defensive Player
of the Week J.C. Price said. “He
is a great quarterback. If he sits
back there and gets his feet set,
he will pick us apart. He is defi-
nitely good enough to beat us if
we don’t get good pressure on
him.”
Another Panther offensive

‘threat. will be tailback Billy West,

who will likely return this week
from an injured shoulder. Last
season West ran for 1,358 yards
as a sophomore and averaged
124.5 yards per game.

“I guess [West] is going to be

back,” Price said." “It wouldn’t
hurt my feelings if coach
[Johnny] Majors kept him out
another week.

“He’s got legs like tree trunks;
one guy isn’t going to bring. him

down very often.”

To counter this offensive attack, ‘ , _
the Hokies will field one of the 
top—rated defenses in the confer- E
ence. Giving up 66.3 yards per .
game on the ground, the Hokies 7
have the second-rated rushing :
defense in the country. However, 8

they will need to concentrate on
their secondary, which is current-
ly ranked 79th and has been sus-
pect at times during their first
three games.

To achieve this, the defense
will continue to make use of
alternating cornerbacks. With
starter Antonio Banks our for the
next few weeks, the emphasis is
on keeping the secondary fresh.

In last week’s win against
Miami,
allowed 55 yards rushing, but
gave up 320 yards passing, even
after starting quarterback Ryan
Collins left the game with an
injury. The squad was led by
Price, who racked up a career-
high 11 tackles and four quarter-
back sacks.

Offensively, Tech hopes to have
continued success running the

closer match than the score
showed.

“Shabrack had very close
games. even though the score
doesn’t show it,” Dieffenbach
said. “There were several
games that went to deuce, and
Erin just couldn’t close
[Nalluri] out. It was definitely
Erin’s best match of the year.”

In No. 2 singles, Hall beat
Davis 3-6, 6-4; 6-3.

"‘Hall was very tenacious and
played very well in the third
set. She used a lot of underspin
and topspin,” Dieffenbach said.
“She got Fran out of position a
lot.

“It was a good loss; those
three-setters toughen up a play-
er. They pay off down the road
at the end of the season.”

From there it was all Lady
Panthers. as they won 48 of the
next 52 games to take the vic-
tory.

In third singles, Baker domi-
nated Gatta, winning 6-0, 6-0.
Zielinski defeated Ingham 6-1,
6-0 in No. 4 action. At No. 5
singles, it was Bible beating
Zagatti 6-1, 6-3, and getting
Pitt’s final point was Tamara
Kalesnik by defeating Garchar
6-4, 6-0.

Dieffenbach credits the Lady
Panthers’ success on compet-
ing in early season tourna-
ments.

“The tournaments show
players very fine competition
that gets us ready for singles
matches,” Dieffenbach said.

This victory also shows
where Pitt stands compared to
other local teams, as YSU

I “defeated Duquesne and Robert

Morris earlier this season.

The Lady Panthers take to
the road this weekend, travel-
ling to Canisius on Saturday

‘and to SUNY Buffalo on

remembering the last two
games over us, and also after
that big conference win over
Miami,” Majors said.

Lucky for Beamer, running
back Dwayne Thomas is there
to help lighten the load on
Druckenmiller’s shoulders.
Thomas is third in the Big East
with 87.7 yards per game and
averages 4.6 yards per carry.

Thomas was named Big East
Co—Offensive Player of the
Week after his 165-yard, 25-
carry performance against the
Hurricanes. He scored Tech’s
lone touchdown. He set the
tone early in that game, carry-
ing seven straight times for 43

‘yards on the opening posses-

sion of the game. It was his
seventh career 100—yard rush-
ing game.

“Offensively, we ran the ball
a heck of a lot better, and that
took pressure off of our quar-
terback,” Bearner said.

If Virginia Tech is able to run
well against the Panthers, look
for Druckenmiller to have a
nice game against a depleted
Pitt secondary.

plays are mixed up.

3. Injuries — Can Billy West
and Denorse Mosely return
from injuries suffered in the
first game of the season? A
backfield with West, Harris
and Patton could be danger-
ous. The secondary has been
troubled lately, and Moseley’s
return would help.

Tech lost starting corner-
back Antonio Banks for three
to six weeks with a knee
injury suffered in practice.
This could open up the pass-
ing game for the Ryan and the
Panthers.

Tim Glass, in for Reggie
Thomas at center, and Tim
Robbins, in for Tony
Orlandini at tackle, must play
well on the line and open up
holes for the backs.

4. Third Down conversions .

— Pitt is only 18 of 47 on
third down conversions so far
on the year, including only
four of 10 last week against
Ohio State. The Panthers ran
the ball on all six failed third
downs. On three of the four
successful attempts, Ryan
threw to Jells, once for a 24-
yard score.

5. Prevent the big play -
Pitt gave up three touchdown
passes over 35 yards to Ohio
State last week, including a
75—yarder to Terry Glenn.
Glenn burned the Pitt defense
for 253 yards receiving and
four scores on only nine
catches. Tech’s Jim
Druckenmiller does not have
the arm that OSU’s Bobby
Hoying does, though.

6. Balance the offense — Pitt
had only two rushing first
downs last week against‘OSU
compared to 12 through the
air. The Panthers must estab-
lish the running game in order
to open up the aerial attack.
Tech did hold the ‘Canes to 51
yards on the ground last week,
so this will be very important.
7. Win the fourth quarter -
Pitt has given up 50 fourth
quarter points (12.5 avg.) in
four games and scored only 28
(7.0 avg.). Against Texas,
Ryan threw three intercep-
tions, including one on the last
drive of the game, when Pitt
trailed 31-27.

8. Crowd — The first two
home games had respectable
attendance. 35,513 and
28,329, respectively. Last
week there were 54,917 at Pitt
Stadium, but about 30,000
made the trip from Columbus.
A rowdy crowd could make
the difference in what looks to
be a close game.

Throw objectivity out the
window for a moment. Pitt
played well against Texas on
TV, but then got blown out
last week. To keep bowl hopes
alive, they have to beat the
Hokies on TV, even though it
is only on the Big East net-
work.

Pitt bounces back this week
and beats Virginia'Tech for the
first time, Pitt 27 — Virginia
Tech 21.

“Tara and Jessica got to do
some things that they hadn’t

. been doing much lately. Tara

did a good job setting, and
Jessica got some work at
right outside hitter.”

This victory upped Pitt’s
overall record against
Youngstown State to 10-0.

The Lady Panthers will try
to even their record at 7-7
when cross-town rival
Duquesne comes to the Field
House for a 7 p.m. start

ball.

Last week, Co—Offensive
Player of the Week Dwayne
Thomas ran for l65'yards
and scored the Hokies lone
touchdown on a l-yard dive
into the end zone. Overall,
Tech’s offense amassed 397
yards of total offense against
Miami, coming off a game in
which they gained only 41 in
the entire second half versus
Cincinatti.

One nearly fatal shortcom-
ing of the Hokies which
almost did them in last
weekend was the kicking
game. Although punter John

Thomas was much improved’

in the punting department,
placekicker Atle Larsen had
a rough day, missing 4 of 6
field goals.

“It is just not Atle,”
Beamer said. “Atle Larsen is
a good kicker. The opinion
of the field goal team is not
a quality team for us right
now.”

The problem, according to
the coaching staff after
reviewing the game film,
was a technical error that the
holder, Thomas, was mak-
ing. As Larsen approached
the ball, Thomas was inad-
vertently lifting his finger
from the ball, allowing it to
move.
