Dorm
guests
can now
swipe in

Gretchen Andersen
Staff Writer

Students can say goodbyeto the
long lines of residents waiting to
sign guests into their Litchﬁeld

- Towers and Sutherland dorms.
The start of the fall semester ‘

brought a new electronic swipe-
in system to all three Towers and
Sutherland East and West. The new
setup allows residents to sign in
Pitt—student guests by simply hav-

» ing the guard swipe their Pitt IDs.

For non-Pitt students, the pro-
cess remains the same. Guests are
still required to showtheir license
to the security guard and sign in
with their name, address. and time
in before entering the building.
However, by spring semester the
swipe—in system. should read li-
censes as well. .’

For student’s with Pitt IDs that
do not scan, the traditional sign-in
process will continue to be used.‘

‘ SGB Board memberjames Lan-

‘dreneau began working on getting

the system installed in spring 2010

after former Board member David A

Gau approached him to sign _a pe-
tition pushingfor an electronic
system. '

From 2010 on, Landreneau said
he worked to make it his own proj-
ect, using the new sign-in system

as part of his campaign for Board

elections last fall. ..
“I told the students this is not an
absolutely original idea, but I prom-
ise this will happen. I’ve had my
feet wet in this project since I was

Palm that the garden is already

it’s something worthwhile,” he said.

The new system includes a computer

at each guard stand and an electronic card
reader.

Now with the electronic system, the resi-
dent student will hand his ID to the guard,
who will swipe the guest’s student ID. The
guest’s information pops up on the computer
screen after the swipe.

Landreneau said students will check back
with the guard when they leave the building

Electronic system allows guests to swipe IDs

swipe their guests’ cards, so that the guards
can still keep track of who comes in and goes
out of the dorms. .

He said the system will beneﬁt Pitt stu-
dents in two ways: convenience and secu-
rity. .

“If it wasn’t a ridiculous name like Bugs
Bunny or Mario signed in, it was a phony
address,” Landreneau said. “A lot of times
students who lived off campus didn’t want to
take the time to write their whole address so
they would claim they still lived on campus
 and that right there is a huge violation of
the signing—in approach.”

Dakota Eggletan, a security guard in Tower
B, said the traditional sign—in system left stu-
dents waiting in line for a long time, and she
often couldn’t read their handwriting.

University spokeswoman Patricia White
said the swipe—in system will help with these
security concerns., -’ - '

“Additionally, because the swipe—in pro-
cessrecords the information from the student
ID, it eliminates issues of handwriting that is
illegible,” White said. '

White said the system is also secure be-_

cause guards, who trained to use that system
over the summer, will “continue their normal
procedures by checking the students’ IDs and
their photos.” ' B

Landreneau said the electronic swipe-in
is something that both students and admin-
istration have wanted. “

For two years he has been meeting with
James Earle, director of Housing Services,
and Shawn Brooks, associate dean of stu-
dents and director of Residence Life, about
the system. ' S

White said in an email that the electronic
system cost less than $15,000, an investment
made by Pitt’s Housing Services. .

The electronic swipe—in system hasn’t

expanded‘ to alldorms yet because Hous—_

_ing “wanted to ensure thesystem‘ is func-
tioning properly as well as «training all the
security guards efficiently and effectively,”
White said. ‘ H ..

Landreneau said that by next semester the
program will expand to all of the dorms on
campus and will read guests’'1icenses.

‘ Eggletan said she thinks the electronic

system is a good thing for students, but did '
mention that it occasionally crashes and re— ‘

quires rebooting. .

“It is very convenient with time,” Eggle—
tan said. “It is very accurate, automatically
bringing up students’ basic information [on
the computer] .” . p 9 A

Landreneau said that he spoke with three
different guards on Wednesday, and received
similar responses. ‘

A If the computers crash, a slow system re-
boot is required before electronic sign in can
resume. He said if this happens, the guards go
back to the traditional way of signing in.

“It’s really been a collaborative effort to

', get this project done, and I’m really excited,”

Landreneau said..“Hopefully this fall it is a
smooth transition-.” ﬂ -

Preserving 9/11’s
significance

For most Pitt students, early Sep-
tember consists of raucous house
parties, new classes, warm weather
and reunions with friends. This
upcoming weekend, though, might
inspire more melancholy than ex-
citement.

As most readers are aware, this
Sunday marks the 10th anniversa-
ry of Sept. 11. Accordingly, today’s
magazine —— alongside countless
other publications across the coun-
try — will re—examine the tragedy
and its still—affecting aftermath.

Despite the pervasive coverage,
however, one observation risks go-
ing unmentioned: Ours is the last
generation that will remember ac-
tually living through 9/11. Those
born after, say, 1996, will know
of the day’s panic only through
their elders and the media. This
is both a blessing -— at the very
least, younger Americans won’t
witness the same Islamophobia
—-— and a cause for concern.

The more chronologically re-
mote a disaster becomes, the less
emotional resonance it retains.
Pearl Harbor, we suspect, does
not disturb students in nearly the
same way 9/11 does; and the 1906
San Francisco earthquake likely
registers even less profoundly.
Sure, we have images to remem-
ber these events by, images which
might arouse sympathy, but there’s
no substitute for living through the
ordeal and experiencing ﬁrsthand
the resulting panic.

As earth-shattering as it was
for us, 9/ 11 will inevitably undergo
the same sterilization. In fact, it
would be astounding if the event’s
20th or 30th anniversaries were to
be as hallowed as this one. By its

 

1ooth anniversary, Sept. 11, 2001,
will be lucky to garner mention
at all.

But rather than despairing,
our generation, as witnesses to
history, can still protract the di-
saster’s signiﬁcance by retelling
our experiences of it as vividly,
as faithfully and as regularly as
possible to those born after the
mid—1990s. Solemn anniversaries
and perfunctory moments of si-
lence aren’t enough; in order to
remain relevant, the event must

retain its human element, which ,

is contained chieﬂy in individuals’
accounts.

Already, a robust catalogue of
artwork — Don DeLillo’s “Falling
Man,” Paul Greengrass’s “United
93,” Bruce Springsteen’s T/ye Rising
—— exists for just such a purpose.
But the obligation to tell stories
extends beyond artists. Everyone
who remembers watching the cha-
os unfold on TV or who, God for-
bid, saw it happen ﬁrsthand, must
work to ensure that those who
weren’t yet born or aware enough
in 2001 nevertheless understand
its psychological impact.

Ground zero has been cleared
of rubble. Osama bin Laden is
dead. One World Trade Center is
rising to ﬁll the void left by the
Twin Towers. In light of these
developments, it’s all too easy to
neglect the memory of Sept. 11,
and to forge forward with.a clear
conscious. -

But if we carry out our duty as
storytellers — if we treat history
as a matter of personal experience
—-— then, perhaps, the potency of
9/11 will endure beyond our life-
times. :11:

The riot policeman’s dilemma

 

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Why do people decide to riot? And
what is the proper response by au-
thorities? I I I
Both of these questions are easy
to answer in a totalitarian regime.
. People are rioting because they
don’t like how things are going.
The authorities, without the rule of
law and respect for human rights to
restrain them, respond in the most
heavy-handed manner possible.
However, when it comes to the
recent riots in a Western democracy
such as the United Kingdom, both
of these questions have complex
answers. Depending on whom you
ask, you’ll hear that the riots were
caused by anything from frustration
at government beneﬁt cuts to rage
at income inequality, the shooting
death of a resident, the breakdown
of the family or general moral de-
generation. The response from
police has been roundly bashed by
those who saw the bobbies unable
to control four nights of mayhem.
I have experienced four riots
here in Oakland: when the Phillies

football game.

Chris Neverman I For The Pitt News

Riot police are criticized both when they employ strong force —- as they did during the G-20 (above) —

and when they don’t, writes columnist Mark Kozlowski.

won the World Series; when the
Steelers won the AFC and then the
Super Bowl, and the G—2o confer-
ence. Although I’m not anything
more than an armchair psycholo-
gist, I noticed a few things about the
behavior of crowds that might help
analyze the trouble in England.
The most important thing to
recognize about a mob — especially
an angry one — is that it is mostly
disorganized and mostly does noth-
ing. Most of those caught up in the
G—2o were out on Forbes because

_ they heard something was going

on and didn’t want to miss the ex-
citement. Second, riots easily devi-
ate from their supposed purpose.
During one of the Steelers riots,
although there was much waving
of Terrible Towels, I noted that a
couple of enterprising gentlemen
had no luck selling commemora-
tive Super Bowl T—shirts. Though
much of the crowd members were
wearing Steelers gear, a lot of them
weren’t. And there is no explanation
as to why smashing street signs,
destroying a bus stop, breaking
windows and bending parking
meters -has anythingto do with a

Now consider the mayhem in

England. The explanation that the

riots were caused by government
austerity is preposterous. The cuts

to government beneﬁts were pro-
posed months ago, but have yet
to take effect. Furthermore, the
targets of the rioters.‘— high-end
shops with plenty of valuable stuff
to steal —— are not consistent with
an anti-austerity narrative. Shops

are not the primary targets of po-

litical protesters who dislike what
the government is doing to them.

If the mob focused on coherent
political objectives, we would see

more damage to structures visibly
associated with government, such
as party headquarters and police

stations. Indeed, when protesters

were explicitly protesting austerity

measures months ago, they saved

their most destructive impulses for

the headquarters of the Conserva-

tive Party.

So why did the rioters cause so
much mayhem? Because they could.
The beneﬁts to joining in the riots,
such as shopping without the hassle
of having to pay, outweighed the

consequences of unlikely arrest.

Happy medium of police action elusive during riots

Once in a mob, a person feels a sense of in-
vulnerability. With ‘protesters doing illegal
things right and left, odds are not all of them
are going to get caught. The rioters’ thought
process turns to: why not do something il-
legal ourselves? ‘ .

Now that we understand the rioters, we
have to understand the impossible position
of the police. Compare the English riots to
our G-20 riots. During that “crowd-control

. incident,” the police were not at all squeamish
' about the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, sonic

rioters, bystanders or reporters. Although
there was widespread and justiﬁable outrage
about violations of civil rights expressed in
this paper and elsewhere, you have to admit
that property damage was minimal.Anarchist
websites-are only boasting about $50,000
in damages, and there were only about 200
arrests. The numbers comparequite favor-
ably to morethan 500 arrests and at least
$750,000 in damages incurred when Toronto
hosted the same event.

0 In a Western. society which values civil

during the G—20 had exercised more restraint
in exchange for more damage, we would have

heard a chorus of complaints about howthe

cops let anarchists loose on the streets. If the
police in London had immediately turned to
rubber bullets, tear gas, stun guns and water
cannons, there would have been weeks if not
months of editorials about how the police are
a bunch of Nazis.

Is there ‘a happy medium between too
much force and too little? Maybe. But can

‘ that happy medium be found in the heat of

of hindsight, nobody knows the exact amount
of force that would have been needed to keep
Oakland peaceful during the G-20 and Steel-
ers riots. This is not to say thatthe police
shouldn’t be held accountable when abuses
occur —-— they should. It’s just to say that the
answer as to why people rioted so viciously
in Britain is simple —— because they could
— and the answer as to what the correct

response from the police should have been

is complicated and unknowable.

The attacks on Sept. 11, 2011,
sent reverberations throughout the
United States, particularly through
the Muslim community after great

emphasiswas put on the religion
of the offenders. Today, Muslim-

Americans still face increased

scrutiny because of their religion.
The Pitt News sat down with four
people with ties to the Muslim
community to discuss their personal
experiences after the 9/11 attacks —
from racial proﬁling to their abilities
to engage in open discussions about
religion. Living in the United States
in the wake of the tragedy, these
four individuals witnessed the word
“Muslim” take on new connotations
and the national perception of the
community change.

on the USA, like, “Let’s bomb them and get

them back,” but I didrftrealize the people we’re , .
A bombingare notnecessarilyresponsible,thatthe

peoplethatwere beingtargetedweren’t criminals

‘ orterrorists. _ ‘-

' - 'I'PN: Whatare some ways that 9/1'1 impacted
your life, either directly or indirectly?

Louie Al-Hashimi: As for me, I feel like I
wasn’t a victim of discrimination  It’s" not as

apparent that I’m a practicing Muslim, a lot of -

people aren’t aware of that until I tell them. But
looking back on it now, it seems that 9/11 opened
the door for discussion on Islam; it opened the

doorforclearingup those misconceptions. Lots -

of Americans didn’t know much about Islam,
and after these attacks occurred, it seemed like
there was a collective drive to learn more abou
Islam. . , '

'I_‘PN: How do you  that has been posi-
tive or negative?

MY:Ithinkit’sbeenadouble—edgedsword.It ‘

has opened a discussion about Islam, but at the
same time, most people in that discussion do not
want to know. They really don’t care about what

‘ Islam is; they care about what Islam pertains
to. So they ﬁndtkey words, key passages that '

say, “Attack the nonbelievers” or “Do this” or
“Do that.” They take it out of context," and then

people believe that this is Islam when it isn’t. If
you read the passages where it says “Destroy the
nonbelievers,” you’ll ‘see a passage right after
that says, “...in selfdefense,” or, ‘.‘If they give up,
don’t attack anymore.” We are areligion of peace,
but people take it out of context, and I wish that

9/11 wasn’t the event that brought Islam to the < '

forefront, because now it’s subconscious.
For the ﬁrst ﬁve years or so after 9/11, we all

assumed that 9/11 happened andwe did nothing ,
V wrong. It just happened because “they’re bad

people and we’re the good people,” and “we’re
uyingto right the wrongthat they did.” But then
you look at history, and you look at the,Cold War
with Russia and how we used Afghanistan and
completely did nothing to help their schooling,
their way of living. And that is whyterrorists

get bred, because they have resentment. Be— .

cause if we use a person to an end, people feel

disgruntled.

TPN: What about the people around you?
How has it changed their  of their ‘country
and of you? '

RB: We have a few friends, mutual friends,
that the day after 9/11 they had their homes

raided by the FBI. Of course, they weren’t con— 0
nected, they were simply Muslim and they had

Yacoub: New conversation on Muslim faith
brings more scrutiny than‘ acceptance

9/11 Discussion < 10

Arab names, but their homes were raided and
were being questioned. Most of these people

‘ were the same age we were, so it was like im-

mediately they were not only “the other” — they
were a threat. And I don’t think most people
even considered that they -would be a threat to
their own society, and I don’t think people liv-

ing in these communities that had high Muslim

populations ever thought of them as the enemy.

' I think that’s caused a lot of tension and a lot of

the anti-Muslim crusades that are going on right
now  throughout the country. ‘

TG:  [9/11] led to ﬁeld work where I lived
in a Muslim commtmity for almost two years
conductingﬁeld work looking atthe impactthe
USA PATRIOT Act had on Muslim communities
in Florida, and I continue to still Write about it
today. ' A

at the indigenous Muslirn—American community
or the immigrant Muslim—American community,
there’s a sense of fear. If you carmot trust the

f police, which is an extension of the government,

it makes an entire community really close down

[and] become isolated. And we still struggle

with that today. Outreach is simply not enough
for these communities. It has to be a genuine,

respectﬁil, almost humbling experience for law
enforcement... to say, “We need your help on
this war on terror,”  It becomes a matter of
respect — respectwho you are as people, respect
your faith. - '

TPN: What were some ofthe things you faced

’ whenyoudealtwithlaw-enforcementpersonnel

and you were doing your research?

TG: Walking simply. through the mall and
having someone, a law_ enforcement agent, stare

at you '—— and you have to keep in mind when I 1»

[Law enforcement] couldn’t care less about

youas aperson, andthey automatically associate ’ ‘i
you with knowing information about political "

violence  But you have to understand, fear is a
very strange emotion. It  people do things

that they would _normally never do. So I don’t _

does have its ramiﬁcations, aiidlong  

youcan see.

MY: On a very personal it affected  
family. [About] four years ago;-'tl1ere was an‘at— -
tempted bomb threat at my younger brother’s '

middle school, and the ﬁrst thing  they did

   

" was they called up three Muslims and he was

one of them. And they raided their lockers, and
they made them look like terrorist suspects in
front of everybody. Everyone knew who was
being called, and he was one of the people being

' called. He was about 12. How do you ﬁx that?

That’s damaging to a 12-year—old.~How does he
reconcile that he is not the enemy anymore if
he’s put out on a line?

LA: I’ve never experienced anything quite
on a personal level like Mahmoud has  There’s
obviously asense of fear that built up after 9/11,
but the Islamic community in Pittsburgh, it does

feel like we are kind of under a microscope lens -

at times, like we are always being watched. We

have to monitor our own behavior. A sense of .

respect when it comes to law enforcement would
make that enforcement more in eﬁect and more
practical. ‘

‘TPN: What do you think could have been

. done differently? How could the government

have handled it better? How could police have
handled it better? ' '

MY: After the attacks, [the government]
could have clariﬁed that it wasn’t all Muslims
that didthis. Because they did avery bad PR job,
they said “al-Qaida,” but they said, “It’s aMuslim
group, it’s a_ Muslim group, it’s a Muslim group.”
So all of a sudden, Muslim is bad, it’s terrorist 
But it’s not like that, but the government didn’t
clarify. So the only thing [the public] knew was
extreme. So the law enforcement, obviouslythey
had.to act like every Muslimwas an extremist, a
terrorist that could possibly attack America.

TPN: I-Iow do you  since most l?itt un-

 Assimilating:

Advice from aveteran

Welcome to the (civilian) life,
soldier.

So there you are. You’ve had
this feeling before, this feeling
of anxiety — only this time, it’s
different.

This time it’s not about wak-

ing up on time, making sure your .
boots are shined, uniform pressed I

and haircut squared away. For us
combat veterans, it’s not worrying
if your weapon is clean and will

ﬁre or if the security team cleared .

the route properly. This is not that
feeling you get right before you

’ ' leave the wire — that feeling of

excitement churned with a dash
of worry and a dab of doubt.

But it’s there — different, but
there.

There are thousands of us
veterans making the transition
from soldier to student every year.
Thousands of confused, anxious
and excited former soldiers, ready
to take the leap, ready to enjoy
civilian life once again.

Be excited; be confused. Enjoy

next great adventure. Trust me,
you’re prepared.

When I am asked to describe
the biggest challenge in assirnilat—
ing back into‘ civilianlife, I never
really hesitate to say, “The peo-
ple.” It just seemed like everyone
was apathetic to what was going
on in the world.

I’ve learned over the years that
this isn’t necessarily true. But, at
the same time, it sometimes is.

People still have their agendas,

and they go about their business, '

but I never saw that sense of ur-

_ gency we were trained to have in

the military. I also noticed that
kids my age —_I was 23 when I left
the service — seemed to be the
worst offenders of this apathy. <

I couldn’t wrap my mind
around this.

But-that question probably
isn’t fair.

In the military, we had a differ-

_ ent mission —— one that required T

the sense of urgencyl am sure you

are feeling right now. The mission ’

of protecting America and her val-
ues depends on this.

To be fair, we all signed the
dotted line and had a fairly good
idea of what we volunteered for.

This is a trait you should em-
brace, as it is a trait we veterans
have ingrained in our skulls. I
have found it far more beneﬁcial

to embrace this proﬁciency than '

to harbor resentment toward our
newly acquired compatriots.
This tool, discipline, is perhaps

one we took for granted while

serving because most everyone
had it. Now you ﬁnd yourself
surrounded by young adults who
haven’t yet had the beneﬁt of at-
taining such a skill. A

You might also ﬁnd that some ‘
don’t appreciate your service as
much you would like: Key in the
Westboro Baptist Church. , 

Again, I have to bring up that
word “vo1unteer.”

You see, some people will never
get it. They will never understand
what you had to endure; they will T
never have to see or do what you
have seen and done; they will
never have the honor of serving
this country.

Perhaps they are too ‘scared,
perhaps they feel like they _are
too good, perhaps they are even
jealous because you were able
to accomplish something they
could never dream of doing _—
or perhaps they don’t possess
that feeling of obligation we felt
to protect this great nation. One
might never know the military dis-
senters’. motivations for feeling
the way they do.

One thing we know for sure:

are very detached from any kind of violence. We
have troops in Afghanistan right now, but we’re
hardly aware of itwhenwe live our daily lives just

as students, so we don’t feel the consequences of d

war, of violence. And that’s another reason why
9/11 was a wake—up call, in many ways.

MY: Like Louie said, if you look at CNN or
somethingandyou see the deathtoll orwhatever,
it’s not a big thing — it’s like this little blurb that

   

passes by. And we have twowars goingon, wars
where people die, but we don’t see death on our
screens, we see it in numbers. '
[For example], 100 Iraqis died today and
then one troop died, but these numbers, they’re
intangible. What does it mean to us? I brought
up Vietnam again —— it’s not like then when they
showed you this is what’s happening, these peo-
ple are dying. Because if they showed you that,
people would not be as docile. People would be

like, “OK, if that’s happening, we can’t,have that
happen.” Because if you see the woman in her
hijab protecting her child because bombs are
hitting down, that’s powerful. But we don’t see
that, in our head we just see a bunch of Osama
bin Ladens running around, and that’s the only

.thing that we’re killing. But that’s not the truth.

For every one Osama bin Laden, there are prob-
ably 20 women or 20 children that are dying.
That’s the truth. Ejg

TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SAUL

New system
needs fine-tuning

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

When the Pitt football team
stormed out of its home tunnel on
Saturday night, the members of
the blue and gold donned an aura
of uncertainty about what kind of

‘team they were going to be.

After 60 minutes of football,

. the questions still linger.

During an offseason when talk
of Pitt’s new high-octane strategy

was so redundant that most fans '

were ready for a new catchphrase,
Pitt ﬁnally opened up the season
and put the new product on the

. ﬁeld. There was some good and

some bad, but all of it was incon-
sistent. I I
In a tribute to Todd Graham’s fu-
eled-up new system, here are your
watery, regular and diesel moments

from this Saturday’s home opener.

against Buffalo.

Water

The Panthers looked like they
had the pedal to the ﬂoor but little
control of the vehicle at ﬁrst, and
the result was a seven—point ﬁrst
half against a MAC team that won
two games last season.

To be blunt, the ﬁrst half of Pitt’s

up-tempo and exciting brand of

football was more reminiscent of
paint drying than play by any kind
of offensive powerhouse. ,

“We ran 43 plays in the ﬁrst
half and only scored seven points,”
Graham said after the game. “That
might be a record.” _ _

In 30 minutes of football, Pitt
had missed two ﬁeld goals and
scored only once, and quarterback
Tino Sunseri had punted twice from
inside Buffalo’s territory. _

The reality check came on the
first play of the game when Sunseri
overthrew wide receiver Mike Sha-
nahan by about 5 yards. Shanahan
—- who could’ve scored on the play
— brought everyone back down
to earth when the ball dropped at
his feet.

Sunseri struggled with his ‘accu- .

racy for most of the game, complet-

ing 16 of 28 passes. The problems

came on the deep-ball, where suc-

cess was nonexistent. Almost all of

the passing production came on
underneath routes that the receiv-
ers turned into big gains.

Regular

Without question, Graham lived
up to his word that the Panthers

would move quickly. For the most . .— 

part, Pitt never took more than 15
to 20 seconds between offensive
plays. The problem was that the
quality of the snaps didn’t match
the quantity. .

Despite some of the struggles, (
signs of the new systemgwere deﬁ— . 1

nitely there, and some of them
were deﬁnitely positive. Pitt ran
66 plays and put the ball in the end
zone ﬁve times.

In the ﬁrst half,‘ the new 3-4 de-

fense was ﬂying allover the ﬁeld
and spent a ton of clock in Buffa-
lo’s backﬁeld. Although they only
produced one turnover —— a; Chas
Alecxih interception — it was a
timely one. . ‘
After the game, Alecxih said
that he played 80 snaps on Satur-‘

.day, the most he’s ever played in a

single game.

Diesel

Two words: Ray Graham.

In his ﬁrst game as the feature
running back, Ray Graham stole the
show and went off for 201 yards on

29 carries and found the end zone V

three times. He also added 50 yards
receiving out of the backﬁeld.

For a guy following in the foot- ‘

steps of Tony Dorsett, Curtis Mar-
tin, LeSean McCoy and Dion Lewis,
he sure looked ready to carry the
torch of great Pitt running backs.

Once he could smell the end
zone, Graham was pretty much
unstoppable against a leaky Buffalo
defense that had trouble wrapping
up the 5-foot—9 back.

Not all the players could keep
up. Combined with Buffalo’s simi-
larly up-tempo style, many players
we're left out of breath and ﬂus-
tered by the quick pace of the game.
Jordan Gibbs, Pitt’s startingright
tackle whom coach Graham said
had trouble breathing, didn’t play
much after the second half. . n‘

junior Ray Graham started the season strong on Saturday. The running back rushed for 201 yards and
scored three touchdowns on his way to earning the selection as Big East Offensive Player of the Week.

Panthers g

et ﬁrst win in

Johnston’s goalie debut

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Panther freshman Lee Johnston’s

ﬁrst career start in goal for the Pitt ‘

men’s soccer team couldn’t have
gone any better.

Johnston’s shutout Friday night
gave Pitt its ﬁrst win of the season, as
the team defeated Stony Brook 1-0

at the Duquesne Invitational. Led_

by Johnston’s goalkeeping and two
goals from sophomore Nico Wrobel,
the Panthers (1-2-1) left Pittsburgh
1-0-1 in the tournament and feel-
ing much better about themselves
after a rocky start to the year that
included a 2-1 loss to Robert Morris
and a 3-0 loss to St. Francis.

_ “Things can change from game
to game, but right now Lee’s playing

‘well and the team is playing well

behind him,” head coach Joe Lux-

.;__,.__,. 

bacher said after Sunday’s game, a
1-1 tie with Valparaiso. “So obviously
we stick with Lee.” .

The team reliedon signiﬁcant
minutes from Johnston and four
other freshmen against Stony Brook
and Valparaiso, as they have for
much of this year. Johnston made
seven saves in the ﬁrst half Friday
against Stony Brook (0-1-2), as the
Seawolves out-shot Pitt 12-7 and
out-comered them 5-0 before in-
terrnission.

Stony Brook ﬁnished with im-
pressive stat lines — 19 shots and
11 corner kicks — but in the 59th
minute the Panthers jumped on
their chance to take control. Wro-
bel buried a rebound into the net
from senior Terry Akpua’s shot
past Seawolves junior goalkeeper
Stefan Manz forthe eventual game-
winning goal.

Wrobel accounted for Pitt’s of-

fense again Sunday afternoon, as he ““~

scored the Panthers’ lone goal in the
draw with Valparaiso (1- -1). Wrobel
converted a penalty kick in the 20th
minute to put his team up '1-0.
“He’s been very, very important

to the offense,” Akpua said after the .,

game. “He’s been working hard.
He’s a huge part of our offense fo
sure.” ‘

Two of Wrobel’s three goals this
season have been on penalty kicks.
He has scored every Panthers goal
of the regular season.

“We need to score more goals

on the ﬁeld, obviously, not just on '

penalties,” Luxbacher said.
Although Pitt’s offense hasn’t
created and converted as many
chances as it would like, senior de-
fender Shane Flowers said that the

forwards and midﬁelders have been

riding strong defensive play. .

“It all really starts up top,” he said after
Sunday’s game. “I thought we got pressure
from our forwards, and our midﬁelders were
a lot better. We checked our man, and that
helped us out on the defense  and helped

. us reduce shots on net.’-’

3»

The Panthers defense stymied the Crusad-
ers for most of Sunday’s game, allowing just
one shot on goal in the game’s ﬁrst 70 minutes.
But Valparaiso only needed a second shot
on target to knot the game at one, when the
Crusaders’ sophomore Todd Vervynckt put
one pastjohnston in the 73rd minute.

“It was a set piece,” Flowers said. “They
played along ball in, and the defender came
in and tried cutting up the pass, and the of_—
fender just had a little bit of time  just a little
miscommunication there.”

In overtime, Pitt’s Daniel Mark had a
chance to win the game from close range,
but his shot sailed high.

“We deﬁnitely made strides forward,” Lux-
bacher said. “I’m disappointed we didn’t get
the result. We had the 1~0 lead and gave up
the tying goal. And then we had a chance in
overtime — ball’s sitting on the 5—yard line,
open net, hit it over top.” - ‘

Valparaiso out-cornered Pitt 10-1 on Sun-
day. The Panthers surrendered 21 comer kicks
at the invitational while taking only two.

“What we’re not doing is getting wide play

and getting in behind their defense,” Luxbach-
er said. “That’s what usually results in corner
kicks  They have to get it out and they put it
over the goal line for a corner [kick]. On the
other end, we’ve been too passive defensively
on the wide areas. We’re letting players get
wide on us defensively.”

Flowers said that the margin of corner
kicks, while not ﬂattering, is better than some
alternatives. ' A

“The formations that we’re playing, the
formations that the other teams are playing,
you get a lot of 1—v—1s,” he said. “Rather than
give a shot on net, you want to block it, and
usually that leads to corners. It would be nice
to reduce our comers and reduce the hassle
of always coming back and worrying about
set pieces.”

Flowers said the younger players showed
improvement at the invitational.

“Deﬁnitely the freshmen came in and

A played a big role and helped us out there,” he

said. “We’re still playing to ﬁgure out different
formations and different positions for each
player, but I think now we’re starting to mesh
a lot better and trying to play as a team.”

Flowers added thatjohnston, one of those
freshmen, hasn’t looked out of place in his ﬁrst
regular—season collegiate action.

“Coming in as a freshman, it’s always ner-
vous playing in the Big East,” he said. “He’s
done wel .” I '

Pitt football starts slow,  

Sports Editor

The ﬁrst half of Todd Graham’s inaugural
game looked more 87 unleaded than high-
octane._ '

‘ Pitt defeated Buffalo 35-16 on Satur-
day night at Heinz Field, but the Panthers

" played like a team still adjusting to a system

overhaul, especially in the ﬁrst half when
Pitt managed to put up just seven p.oints.
“It didn’t surprise me. I wasn’t in a panic
where we were,” Graham said of his team’s
slow start. “I thought we responded well,
offensively infthe second half. I thought we
responded the other way‘defensive1y.”
The Panthers wentiinto the break with.

V "a slim 7-3 advantage, running 43 plays but

scoring just one touchdown. ‘

Pitt quarterback Tino Sunseri couldn’t
[ﬁnd his mark in the ﬁrst half and over-
-threw, receivers on several occasions as
theystreaked downﬁeld. g 4 g

“We’re really, really close,’’ Graham said.
“If we hit those two long balls when we got
a guy running with nobody on him, then
everyone is excited.”

Sunseri ﬁnished the opening half with
91 yards on 10—of—21 passing, looking like a
quarterback in his ﬁrst half running a new
offensive system. ,

“The biggest thing  the ﬁrst half was ’
., that all my reads‘ and everything were

right,” Sunseri said. “‘That’s the positive
thing that came out of the ﬁrst half  We
were able to go into halftime really just
focusing on us. We came out in the second
half feeling like if we were just able to focus
[and] just ﬁnish plays, we were going to be

V able to score points.”

In the second half, both Sunseri and
the rest of the Pitt offense appeared more
comfortable, and Sunseri ﬁnishedthe game
with 179 yards on-16-28 passing and one
touchdown. -V P.

Ray Graham led the rushing attack with
201 yards on 29 carries and three touch-
downs’. He averaged 6.9 yards per carry.

Pitt couldn’t establish much of a running
game in the ﬁrst half, as Graham led the
Panthers with 59 yards on 15 carries. .

“There were holes [in the defense] ,” Ray ‘

Graham said; “It was me being hesitant.

half, there was a lot of pressure coming.

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt’s junior running back Ray Graham was
named Big East Offensive Player of the Week
on Monday for his performance against Buf-
falo. ’ V T ‘

Graham was a clear standout in the game
after rushing for 201 yards and three touch-
downs on 29 carries. The N ewjersey native
also had 50 receiving yards to go with his
dominance on the ground. If .

His rushing total was the second-best of
his career, trailing only a 277-yard perfor-
mance against FIU last season. That mark
was second-best all-time at Pitt, behind
only Tony .Dorsett’s 3o3—yard performance
against Notre Dame in 1975. L

Graham’s 201 yards were also second-
best on the ground in college football’s open-
ing week, coming in behind Malcolm Agnew
of Oregon State who -rushed for 223 yards.

Graham will get a chance to. impress the g

. home crowd again this weekend when Pitt

hosts Maine on Saturday at Heinz Field.

team settled down in the second half. A

“Even though we’ve tried_to simulate
games inpractice, that was our ﬁrst time
runningbour offense in a game,” he said.‘ “I
think we’ll get a lot better.” '

The Panthers’ only points in the ﬁrst half

running back Zach Brown with 9:10 remain-
ing in the ﬁrst quarter. _ - _ _

“Coach [Graham] said after the game.
[that] I played 80 snaps, which is the most

. I’ve ever played,” Alecxih said.

Buff'alo’s similar speed, left many of the play-
