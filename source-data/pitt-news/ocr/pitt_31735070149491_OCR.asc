Santorum
ahead in Pa.,
if not at Pitt

Byjon Anzer
Staff Writer

The Pitt College Republicans
group at Rick Santorum’s alma
mater doesn’t include a single
member who supports him in
the Republican primary, but
polls suggest that Santorum
would have a home-ﬁeld advan-
tage when the primary comes to

Pennsylvania. . S

In his poll of the Pitt club’s
members on Jan. 31, Casey
Rankin, president of the Pitt
College Republicans, said that
among the presidential contend-
ers, former Massachusetts Gov.
Mitt Romney received 93 percent
of the vote, and former Speaker
of the House Newt Gingrich re-
ceived 7 percent, while former
Pennsylvania Sen. Santorum,
who is from suburban Pittsburgh,
did not receive a single vote. This
was the ﬁrst time the group voted
to endorse a primary candidate.

The Pitt College Republicans’
vote stands in stark contrast to a
Franklin 8: Marshall College poll
released Thursday, which shows
Santorum leading Romney by 39
points among Pennsylvania Re-
publicans. Santorum’s national
stock has surged in the wake of
his Feb. 7 wins in Minnesota, Mis-
souri and Colorado. According to
the poll, that momentum has dif-
fused east to his home state.

Rankin cited Santorum’s
spending record in the Senate —
his votes to raise the debt ceiling
and to oppose the National Right
to Work Act, for example —— as
a reason for his lack of support
within the student_organization.

“And he’s outside the main-
stream American thought, espe-
cially on college campuses, with
regard to social issues and some
of the more homophobic state-
ments. But it’s deﬁnitely a two-
sided thing,” he said.

Today, Arizona and Michi-
gan — Romney’s home state --

State Senate
Republican
against cuts

By Andrew Shull
Assistant News Editor

The ranking Republican in
the state Senate Appropriations
Committee came out against Gov.
Tom Corbett’s proposed 30 per;

cent cuts to three state—related”

universities on Monday.

Senator Jake Corman, a Re-
publicanwhose
district in cen-
tral Pennsyl-
vania includes ,
Centre County,
home to Penn 1
State Universi-
ty’s main cam-
pus,, said that -—
after? a decade f";
of decreased
state funding
and last year’s
19 percent funding cut, the state-
related universities should be
spared further cuts. _

“Fm going to do my best to not
have any cuts this year,” he said.

Corman maintained that the
funding the state gives to state-
related universities is “mod-
est” compared to the positive
economic force the institutions
bring to the state.

“My district has one of the
lowest unemployment rates in
the state, and that’s fueled by
Penn State,” he said, pointing to
the jobs that the university cre-
ates both directly and indirectly.

Corman said that the same
could be applied to Pittsburgh
and Philadelphia, home to Pitt
and Temple, the other two state-
related universities facing cuts.

“They all have tremendous».-

economic impacts on the area
they serve,” he said. “You can’t
put a ﬁgure on that.”

In addition to direct job cre-
ation, Corman said the universi-
ties have a positive effect on the
state by giving Pennsylvania re'si— ‘
dents access to higher education.

will hold primaries. Three polls
released Monday had Romney
ahead in Michigan by an average
of four points, whereas a fourth
poll showed Santorum ahead by
two points. The last four Arizona
polls showed Romney with a 13 to
17 point lead in the state. .

Though he was born in Vir-
ginia, Santorum has spent most
of his life in Pennsylvania, partic-
ularly in the Pittsburgh area. He
grew up in nearby Butler County
and received his MBA from Pitt’s
Katz Graduate:- School of Busi-
ness. After working as a lawyer in
Pittsburgh, Santorum was elected
to the House of Representatives
in Pennsylvania’s 018th congres-
sional: . district, which included
Allegheny County, in 1990. He
then made the jump to the Sen-
ate, winning races in 1994 and
2000.

But, as a two-term incumbent
in 2006, Santorum lost his sen-
ate seat to Bob Casey Jr., the son
of a popular former governor, by
a decisive 18 points —— the largest
margin for an incumbent senator
since 1980.

“Santorum, yes, he got clob—
bered by Casey in 2006,” said
Terry Madonna, director of
Franklin 8: Marshall’s Center for
Politics & Public Affairs. “But he’s
still got the hometown—boy thing
going for him, and he has a lot
of support among Pennsylvania

Republicans. After all, he was
elected twice to the United States
Senate here.”
Santorum’s drubbing in 2006
was the result of multiple fac-
tors, Madonna wrote in an article
published Feb. 14 on Franklin &
\Marshall’s website. For one, the
Republican Senator was caught
in a political environment hos-
tile to his party. Public opinion
had turned against the Iraq War
and the Bush administration,
to which Santorum was closely
linked. Santorum himself stoked
public outrage with his “contro-
versial comments on homosexu-
ality and his questioning of the
role of women in the workplace.
On the other hand, Madonna
wrote that Santorum’s growing
conﬁdence,
and “cunning politician” per-

sona suggest that he has a real -

shot at the presidency. He added
that the Republican party at least
once before gave the presidential
nomination to a polarizing,icandi—
date who had recently lost a Sen-
ate race. “The year was 1860,”

Madonna wrote, and “his name

was Abraham Lincoln.” i . .
But Rick Hill, the Pitt College
Republicans’ public relations
chair, said that Santorum’s local
ties hold no bearing over his or-

ganization’s members because,_
like the rest of Pitt’s student- .

body, not everyone in the group
is from Pennsylvania.

“We’re from all over the place,”
said Hill, a resident of William-
sport, in the center of the state.
“If everybody was from Pitts-

disciplined focus

burgh, it may verywell be that
way. But our club is composed of
such a diverse bunch in terms of
where everyone is from, that the
western PA and Pitt thing doesn’t
‘matter as much as you might
think.” ‘
Hill said the Republican nom-
inee’s chances at beating Presi-

dent Barack Obama in the general -

election in November is the most
important issue for the group,
and _in his opinion, Santorum is
not electable’.

“For me, while I do agree with
Sen. Santorum on a lot of things, I
just don’t think he can win a gen-
eral election,” Hill said. “There
are just so many thingslthat he
can be maligned for. Things can
be twisted’ that he’s said or done
in the past that it’s too difficult

to elect him in the general elec- I

Santorum’s campaign did not

Madonna cautioned that the

0 ‘Franklin & Marshall poll results‘

are subject to change, given that
the Pennsylvania primary is not
until April 24. Additionally, 46
percent of respondents in the
poll said they could switch the
candidate they support between
now and the primary.

“Inother words, there could
still be a change once things hap-
pen,” Madonna said. “Now, _it

‘contests in other states. The pri-
mary race will hit 31 more states

But _ according to. Madonna,
when the ‘campaigns ﬁnally heat
up in Pennsylvania, Santorum’s

Michigan that label Santorum a,

“big spender” who “brought all

that money home to Pennsylva-

nia.” .
“Somehow, I don’t think that’s

1 going to work here,” he said.

Rankin added that the College
Republicans will support the Re-
publican candidate regardless of
who wins the nomination, even
though he thinks that it’d be most
difficult to convince members to
“go out and knock on doors and
make phone calls for Rick Santo-

“Pouring Tea” to debut at charity Randa||Theatre Wednesday

By Gwen Barney
Senior Staﬁ Writer

E. Patrickjohnson has ﬁelded the same
unusual question several times following
the performance of his one—man show,
“Pouring Tea: Black Gay Men of the South
Tell Their Tales.” '

_ “People come up to me after the show
and they ask me, ‘Are you schizophren-
ic?’” Johnson said with a chuckle. Johnson
doesn’t suffer from any type of multiple
personality disorder, but he does embrace

multiple personalities — nine. to be exact.

—- for “Pouring Tea.”

Johnson, the Carlos Montezuma ‘Pro-
fessor of Performance Studies and African
American Studies at Northwestern, Uni-
versity, will debut a one-night-only perfor-

.mance of his show at the Charity Randall

Theatre in Pitt’s Stephen Foster Memorial
Wednesday at 8 p.m. In the piece, he reen-
acts the life stories of nine black, southern
gay men between the ages of 21 and 93.
“Pouring Tea” has its roots in a book
Johnson completed nine years ago, “Sweet

Tea: Black Gay Men of the South.” For that

book, he conducted 63 interviews with
black gay men from 15 different southern
states. His research amounted to about
3,000 pages of transcription. '

“[These stories] haven’t been told
before. No one has ever chronicled this
segment of the population. But these sto-
ries are an important part of history and
southern history,”Johnson said;

“When I started interviewing the men
for the project, a lot of them were great
storytellers and just really had me capti-
vated,” Johnson said. ‘,‘When I started‘ to

determined that a lot of the stories felt ﬂat
on thegpage and the readerreally wouldn’t
get a sense of how this person sounded,
how they put stress on this word or that
phrase. And also a lot of regions of the
south have different dialects, and so I said,
‘There has to be a way that I can sort of
recreate the interview experience for the
reader.’ And that’s when I came up with
the idea for doing a show.” '
Johnson said that in the black gay com-
munity, pouring tea is slang for sharing

gossip.

The nine stories Johnson chose to per-
form as oral histories for “Pouring Tea”
center on the experiences of livingas a
southern black gay man, but, Johnson
said, they encompass universal themes to
which anyone; can relate. v

“I',think;;anyone can. ;_see -‘part; of. them-

While Corman said that he would try to
reverse anyfurther cuts to higher educa-
tion, he wasn’t ready to point to another

" area of the state budget he would cut fur-

ther. But he did say that he is opposed to
raising current taxes or enacting_any new

" ones.

Corman did not have any timetable for
when he or the Senate Republicans would
release their own budget proposal.

Members of Pitt’s administration are
scheduled to meet with the Senate Appro-

.priations Committee on Wednesday for a_

hearing regarding the University’s state

funding cut. .

Last year, Corbett initially asked for a
50 percent funding cut to the state—related
universities, while House Republicans pro-

posed a budget that would have cut fund-h

ing 25 "percent and the Senate proposed a
15 percent cut.

The state ultimately passed a 19 percent
cut in its ﬁnal budget inJune. H

Over the eight years that Johnson has
performed’ and perfected his impressions
of the men he portrays, they’ve become a
part of him.

“I feel that I really carry these men in-
side me. I think when I come to Pitt it will
be my 83rd performance, so by now they
are inside me,” he said.

EstherBush, a member of the graduate
student society of Pitt’s Theatre Arts De-

she met him at a conference inJune.

The Duse Society sponsored Johnson’s
upcomingappearance in cooperation with

ment of Theatre Arts, The Dietrich School
of Arts 8: Sciences, the Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Assembly, the Humani-
ties Center and the Performance Collab-
orative. _ _
Bush said the importancefofJohnson’s
show rests in the hidden face of American
history that it reveals. She said it ﬁlls in
“gaps in southern regional history, as well
as a queer and black American history.”
She describes “Pouring Tea” as “a com-
pelling combination of theater, history,
race, class, gender and.everyday life.”
This summer, Johnson plans to begin
a companion project to “Sweet Tea,” in
which he will collect oral histories of black
lesbians of the south.
“Initially, I was going to include lesbi-

ans in my ﬁrst book, but I realized I had
too much information. Now I’m going

back,” he said.
Presently though, he’s focused on

-Wednesday night’s performance at Pitt.

“I’m really excited about performing at
Pitt. I’ve never been to the University of

_ Pittsburgh ever before. I really like inter-

acting with students at the different cam-

- puses I’ve been visiting.”

In addition to his performance, John-
son will present a lecture earlier on
Wednesday titled ,“Border Intellectual:

The lecture, scheduled to run from 2:30
to 4 p.m., will take place in the Humani-

A OPINIONS

‘Flipped’ classrooms should  

meet criteria to be effective

Have you ever been in a ﬂipped
classroom?

We don’t mean in an “Alice in
Wonderland,” up—is—down-and-
down-is-up way .'— we mean the
new technique that’s a hot topic
of discussion among profes-
sors.

The idea isthat “ﬂipping” the
classroom shifts the focus from
professor to student. It forces

‘ students to work together in
groups while - monitored or
guided by a professor. Suppos-
edly, it allows students to forgo
their passive-learning tenden-
cies and tap; into their critical-
thinking skills. “

If done effectively, ﬂipping a
classroom could correct misun-
derstandings immediately and
give students more than one
way to think about a concept or
solve a problem.

But that’s a big “if.”

In trying to ﬂip a class of, say,
200 students, a professor would
never be able to give the right
amount of attention to each stu-
dent. But assuming he could —
with the help of several teach-
ing assistants — we still think a
lot must fall into place before a
ﬂipped classroom could be con-
ducive to learning.

Consider this: A recitation —
mandatory or optional —- is
usually assigned with these big-
ger classes, and that’s where
students can convene in small
groups to go over material. For
most, the small meeting isn’t

where the actual learning pro-
cess takes place, but’ it works
to supplement the material in a
way similar to the ﬂipped- class-
room model.

But assuming that a classroom

does not have a recitation, let’s ' a
consider what steps a professor 

would have to take to make sure
this learning process would
help, not hinder, his students.
The class subject must be the-
ory —— .or j application-based.

We don’t think this method of ;

teaching could be too helpful in

_ massive introductory courses
_ that primarily study core infor-
' mation that involves little criti-

cal thinking. ,

A better outlet for classroom-
ﬂipping would be a subject
like philosophy, where think-
ing through -— and criticizing
—— texts is integral to the ap-
plication of the subject matter.
Therefore, upper—level courses
could beneﬁt from students
working through ideas togeth-
er. -

The professor must serve as
facilitator. It would take a keen
instructor with a fair amount of
experience to make this work.
He would need a solid under-
standing of what academic level
his students are coming in at
and if they would respond fa-
vorably to group activity.

. He would also need to ac-

knowledge that sometimes he
is not the authority on the _is-
sue, and his beliefs and lean-
ings could hinder the ﬂow of
information in «the classroom.
Self—awareness. and the ability
to answerquestions quickly are
integral to this class format.
Finally, the students in a
ﬂipped class must be comfort-
able with subject matter and
open to experimentation. It’s
likely that the student who
falls asleep in the back of the
classroom wouldn’-t exactly be
thrilled with this amount of
group work. ,
Making sure that these are up-
per-level students and clearing
the idea with them ﬁrst would
prevent poor professor ratings
and student absences. Students
eager to learn and discuss ideas

are key to integrating this class- -

room format. , A .
We see the potential of ﬂip-
ping the classroom: It increases

communication skills and could V

produce students who are fa-
miliar» with small—group col-
laboration, a skill essential for
success in the workplace. A

It could be an effective way to
enhance learning, especially at

large research’ institutions like '
. "Pitt. I ‘

But professors should think
before they flip. I

SGB follows strict rules for areason

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

I get it —— rules are stupid
sometimes. We all spent most '
of our adolescence navigating
what seemed to be nothing
more than a maze of regula-
tions governing everything
from clothing choices to bath-
room breaks. Restrictions like
these often seem unnecessary
and counterproductive —
every “no turn on red” sign
makes a little part of me die.

It’s little wonder, then, that
some people might regard two
recent SGB decisions with dis-~
taste. Increasingly, the Board
seems to resemble the cranky
old teacher not allowing any-
body to use the bathroom be-
cause the hall pass is out, ig-
noring common sense while a
seventh grader writhes on the
ﬂoor waiting to relieve himself.

The two rules acting as hall
passes are the restrictions on
funding for international travel
and the restriction on funding
for events that conﬂict with Al-
ternative Spring Break. The two
organizations applying for the
affected allocations — the Afri-
can Students Organization and
the Pitt club baseball/softball
teams —— both requested allot-
ments for events that probably
met. basic standards for allo-
cation funding; they had his-
torical precedent and provided
broad beneﬁts to students. Both
proposals, however, had to be
withdrawn: the former because
Board members said ASO had
asked a comedian to include in-
ternational airfafe in his speak-
er’s fee, and the latter because
it would interfere with the Al-
ternative Break program. (On
Tuesday, SGB approved more
than half of ASO’s revised fund-
ing request, which didn’t include
international travel.)

From the high school anti—rules
perspective, it seems like rules
are once again making life overly
difﬁcult. Completely legitimate

-activities are losing funding be-
cause the SGB is not making ex—'

ceptions —— they’re not allowing
for any grey area.

But this is where the Board
deserves praise. Just as high

see would
need to make
decisions on a
case-by—case
basis, a process
rich in fraud
potential, to try
and justify
the costs.

schools need restrictive rules
to keep things in order, the SGB
needs restrictive rules to main-
tain an atmosphere and appear-
ance of impartiality. Without
strict following of the rules, the
Board would need to resort to
messy, value-based decision

_ making that could easily be-

come manipulated and subject
to favoritism.

Take the Alternative Spring
Break issue. The rule is in the
book because one thing is inar-

guable — most trips over Spring .
‘Break are a bad use of funds.

There are exceptions, of course,
but beneﬁts are generally al-
most entirely concentrated to
those enjoying the time off from
school. The» reasoning behind
the rule is that if a club decides
thatvit has nothing to do over
the break, the Allocations fund
should not act as a purse for
saunters down to Florida.

If an exception is granted for
the baseball and softball teams,
however, the Board can no lon-
ger default to the position that
funding trips over Spring Break
is wasteful. Instead, allowing an
exception for the teams would
set»a precedent that every club
has the ability to try to debate
the merits of a Spring Break trip.
With the number of requests
likely to go way up, the Board
would be in quite a pickle.

SGB would need to make deci-

sions on a case-by-case basis, a
process rich in fraud potential,
to try to see if the beneﬁts would
justify the_costs. Although many
decisions would undoubtedly
be impartial, chances are just
as high that many more would
be weighed down ‘by conﬂicts
of interest. A particularly ath-
letic Board would have different
preferences than a particularly
Greek board; decisions would
be reduced to a reﬂection of the
interests of the members.

And because SGB largely gov-
erns in a bubble, with very little
feedback in terms of voting or
even student interest, there
would be nothing to provide a
basis for what is justiﬁable and
what is not. At the end of the
day, for allocations over $500,
we would just have nine possibly
well—intentioned students mak-
ing decisions that could easily
be slanted, consciously or un-
consciously.

I believe this is why this Board
is so strictly following the rules.
It could, of course, observe the
rule that allows it to scrap the
rules, but it is choosing not to: a
process’ that helps keep all deci-
sions above the Board.

The strict adherence to rules
could be seen as too conserva-
tive. The students of the base—‘

ball/softball teams and ASO

probably feel this way. Indeed,
these two instances show that
good projects sometimes lose.”
But even if this is the case, the
overall decision-making process
when taken together is much
more efficient and cost-effective
than when we have gray areas.

This is, after all, how we feel.

about our own spending; I know
I’d much rather have a Kindle,
after spending $100 than two
Kindles and a bag full of chewed
sunﬂower seeds for $500 dol-
lars. Most should feel the same
about allocation dollars.

Yes, following the rules often is
unwieldy and troublesome. Hall
passes and unnecessary traf-
ﬁc signals are a pain. But there
is no middle ground in student
government. Either we "have a
restrictive system that predict-
ably follows the rules as we do
now, or we have a system that
unpredictably throws decisions
to a group of students. I

For The Pitt News

Every few Saturdays, a group of local high
school teens gathers in East Liberty to pro-
duce a one—hour live—television hip—hop
talk show. They dance, they sing, they rap
and they do it all over a delicious plate of
waffles.

“The Waffle Wopp” has been meeting and
performing at The Waffle Shop on South
Highland Avenue since August 2010. The
restaurant is a typical diner with a dash
of performance art thrown in. Started in
2008 through the Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity arts department, the program offers a
diverse assortment of content that encour-
ages community members to be an active
part of the shows being put on.

The billboard on top of The Waffle Shop
frequently requests the presence of magi-
cians, zoo keepers and talk show hosts,
blurring the line between audience mem—
bet and performer. The shop is a great
place to grab some breakfast, a cup of cof-
fee and a completely unique performance
from talented locals. A

Launched in 2007, “Waffle Wopp” is a
sister project of the ﬂagship program Hip-
Hop on L.O.C.K., an arts education and
mentoring vehicle that educates students
using hip—hop ‘and the music business.
“Waffle Wopp” is a special twist on an in-
teractive live talk show, making it speciﬁc
to the teens involved in the program.

Student participants come from a variety
of Pittsburgh schools, Pittsburgh Public
Schools, Winchester Thurston and The E1-
lis School. Working on the show, they are
able to interact with each other and build
genuine friendships while making music
and learning about possible careers in the
music industry;

After entering the program, studentsare
tasked with developing a music project
from conception to creation. They learn
about all aspects of the music business,
from album cover design and marketing
to lyrical content of songs. This knowledge
has the potential to translate into a job in
the music industry. Somenotable alumni
of the program include Mac Miller’s ﬁrst
manager and current tour manager ‘Quen-

Waﬁles > 10

The Waffle Shop will soon close its doors, leaving “The Waffle Wopp” without a place to ﬁlm its show.

_»The Do—It—Yourself movement isn’t
new. People create handicrafts frequently
as hobbies or even careers, and today the
Internet helps designers connect with
‘ buyers and curious viewers through vari-
ous websites. '

Pittsburgh’s Vincent DeAndrea designs,

jewelry and sells it in the store he owns in
Mt. Washington. There, he’s not only sold
his personal designs, he’s also developed a
speciﬁc clientele.

_ ' DeAndrea uses a traditional means of '

purchasing and selling his supplies. He
goes’ to’ craft shows with thousands of ven-

dors to buy the particular items he needs._
“You can’t help but be inspired. by the,

range of color, sizes and‘ artists. It’s over-

other option. Online marketplaces provide
a virtual storefront for crafters at little to

Sellers often use websites like Etsy'to
reach potential customers. On the site,
artists post their information pic-

needing"a physical location from which to
sell theircrafts, creating a community that
is geared toward very small businesses and
entrepreneurs. _

-‘Roby: ,Ka.1in_ started Etsy in 2005.: With

has now sold more than $467.8 billion of
merchandise. Etsy has quickly grown to
become a popular and effective means for
artist—to—buyer communication. For many
artists, this means exposure to a broad au-
dience, often larger than what an personal
site would garner on its own.

To use Etsy, artists and designers must
create online accounts, which give them
access to buying, selling and showing their
creations in an Internet marketplace. V

For DeAndrea, it was’ simple to, begin
using both Etsy and ArtFire —I another
online craft marketplace —— because of the

I sites’ pre-made template constructions.

The online stores make it easy to upload
photographs with descriptions, and tutori-
als walk users through the process so they
can make their products more public.
Online stores are vital for artists who
look tomake a living off of their designs,
DeAndrea explained. They help artists

erwise have the opportunity to sell to.

The biggest advantage comes from the
direct connection an artist has with his or
her clients, said Sherrard Bostwick, the
education director at the Society for Con-
temporary Craft. Many of the artists that

T teach craft ‘courses at the Society for Con-

temporary Craft have some sort of affilia-
tion with Etsy, which creates space for an
online discussion and a broader ﬁeld for
potential business opportunities.

“Artists have a lot more opportunities
to create discussionand create revenue
options [online]. They’re all ‘different.
Some are more revenue based. Some are
just about being part‘ of the discussion,”
Bostwick said. ’ ~ ‘

And the Society for Contemporary Craft
has even carved its own niche in the online
world. The group has just begun to offer its
classes online, givinginterested individu-
als more access to the information. The
site also includes biographies of the art-
ists and teachers, allowing viewers to gain
more knowledge about the programs.

“I think that art is a discussion, a dia-
logue. I think that anytime you can have
a dialogue with the public, you can learn

I more about their response,” Bostwick

said.
Some sites have a corner speciﬁcally
on this kind of dialogue. Often, they allow

novices to discover patterns and instruc-
tions’ for things they’d like to" make and
share their ideas with friends.

Shannon Krohe, a Pitt junior, has been
on Pinterest since November and has mul-
tiple boards she frequently visits. Pinterest
is an online community that offers digital
open space for members to “pin” photos
of various interests they have. Crowded
onto multiple boards that members create
to tack up their interests, there are often
crafts, recipes and clothing ideas for oth-
ers to enjoy and share. _

In this space, Krohe has the opportu-
nity to post pictures-and links pertinent
to her various interests, re—pin previously
posted material and comment or like the
things on other members’ boards.

Krohe used the website recently to as-
sist in her sorority’s recruitment process.
She most enjoyed craftinga balloon'deco-
ration that hung upside-down from the
ceiling. She made this for a speciﬁc event
and the design became popular on the
website. , Q

Like other blogging websites, Pinterest
is open to the public. Anyone, regardless
of membership, is able to View the website
and have access to the copious amount of
information posted there. There are topics
that allow viewers, to narrow their inter-
ests to a« speciﬁc set of material, ranging
from craft ideas to fashion tips.

But unlike other easily accessible web-
sites, Pinterest is fairly exclusive. Initially,
when looking to join, prospective" members

A must request an invitation and provide

their email addresses. They then wait until
their invitations arrive, permitting them to
create their own spaces and have access to
the spaces of others as well. '

Though it has circulated in more public
spheres, the DIY discussion has also been
joined by curators and educators, and
now a younger generation is interested in
the phenomenon. Bostwick said that, in a
world where everything has been branded,
DIY gives people the chance to make things
personal again. . .

Although the Internet has given craft-
makers a wider venue from which to share
and discuss, the Drop—In Studio at the So-
ciety for Contemporary Craft gives indi-
viduals the chance to get off their comput-
ers and begin creating something. Anyone

‘can go to the Drop-In Studio and create a

personal adornment out of the array of
supplies, which include safety pins, leather
and paper clips. ﬂ

Foods co-ops offer local options, opportunities to students  

By Emma Kilcup
Staﬁ" Writer ‘

When Christopher Leidenand John McEl—
hattan cook, they don’t make microwav-
able ‘mac and cheese, leftover pizza or any
of the usual college staples.

Instead, they make homemade meals
with ingredients that appease their sus-
tainable consciences. The Pitt juniors
agree that the best place to ﬁnd their cook-
ing ingredients is at a food co—op — essen-
tially a grocery store that’s owned and op-
erated by its shareholders and offers local,
organic products and produce.

Pittsburgh has only one established co-
op: the East End Food Co—op. It’s located
in the Point Breeze neighborhood, hidden
beneath a rock—climbing gym. A welcoming
sign outside lures customers with veggie
frittatas and vegan french toast served at
the corner cafe every weekend for brunch.

The market is not huge, but it is full.
Colorful produce lines the wall that leads
to the variety of bulk granola: raspberry,
chocolate, maple nut. The center is packed
with organic products, from local honey to
fair—trade coffees. ‘

The co-op has been around for 35 years
and is part of the National Cooperative
Business Association. The association
connects co-ops throughout the country

produce suppliers and leverage buying
power. There are about 120 working to-
gether now. Although each one has a dif-
ferent system, EEFC General Manager Rob
Baran explained that all co-ops operate
with a nine-person Board of Directors and
an elected general manager.

Baran has been the East End Food Co-
op’s general manager for six years now. He
emphasized the cooperative aspect of the
store: It is a community that participates
in philanthropic efforts and represents

an alternative to large corporation gro—.

cery stores. The store does not just donate
money —~ it tries to be involved. Baran
talked about a redevelopment project he’d
just gotten involved in.

“It’s different for everybody —— they all
have reasons to shop at a food co—op. For
some, it’s that we’re community—owned.
For others, it’s because it’s local, organic
and sustainable. Some businesses put
those philosophies out there and do not
live up to it,” Baran said. “Everyone has
their reasons, but what it comes down to

‘ is that we have great products and are an

organization that is walking the walk.”
Baran sees the co-op as a community
and explained that people come to hang
out — the market’s not just a place to buy
groceries. ’ '

than about the future,” Baran said. “We are
the other guys.” ‘
Baran explained that co-ops are ﬁght-
ing a battle against domineering systems
that select seed strains and threaten the
diversity of food. According to him, it is a
hard battle and the co—ops.are on the losing
side,,but they still put up a ﬁght. They want
choice. The local farmers choose seeds that
work best in their speciﬁc climates — a
right that he said has become endangered.

Hop on L.O.C.K., which is racial diversity.
Our program is for everyone.”

Hip-Hop on L.O.C.K. is. in the process of
organizing a fundraiser to aid the produc-
tion; however, saving the program might
mean modifying it slightly. If organizers
are unable to ﬁnd a brick-and—mortar ven-
ue for the ‘Waffle Wopp,’ then other meth-
ods of producing the show, such as solely
streaming it online, might be on the table.

Presently, the show’s hosts are able to
interview prominent members of the com-
munity and other guests while live, stream-
ing their show on YouTube andthrough
The Waffle Shop’s website, waffleshop.org.

“It’s a shame they’re in this situation,”
Purcell said. “There are not enough spaces
in Pittsburgh for youths to engage in posi-
tive and creative activities. What Hip-Hop
On L.O.C.K. has done atgthe Waffle Shop is
create such a place.” ‘ _

Other programs that regularly perform
or are associated with The Waffle Shop,
like “Cookspeak” and Conﬂict. Kitchen,
will also be affected by its closing.

“The Waffle Shop staff has been great, and
I’m sorry to hear that it’s coming to an end,”
said Tom Totin, the host of “Cookspeak.”
“The guests. I’Ve been lucky enough to land
have been amazing — chefs, cookbook
authors, scientists, musicians, an anchor-
woman and a former astronaut.” After the

T closing, Totin will most likely begin host-

ing the show from either his house, guests’

homes or at various restaurants in thexarea. -

Hip-Hop on L.O.C.K. is keeping its op-
tions open for “The Waffle Wopp.” ,

“We’re hoping that something works out
so we can keep the show going,” Thrasher
said. “It is important for organizations like
ours to continue because we work closely
with students and drive them toward their

the store’s produce is local during the win-
ter, but that percentage increases duringthe
summer. Besides local meat and cheese, the
EE_FC has many local products too: bread,
pasta, tea and even beauty products.

Baran explained that there is a pe-
riphery and a center of the store. The pe-
riphery includes the bulk and perishable
products that offer customers great deals.
The center displays the brand—name prod-
ucts. Although store "organizers buy the

brand—name items through a distributor, .

it’s harder to compete in that area. It’s the
periphery that sets them apart. ,

A member of the co-op pays $100 each
year to receive store discounts and the
power to vote for the Board of Directors.
Members may volunteer in the store and
participate in co-op committees as well.
There are more than 8,000 shareholders
in the East End Food Co-op. Non—members
are welcome to shop at the co-op, but they
do not receive the discounts.

This is why Leiden shops at the co-op
— it’s all more local and accessible. He can
go directly to thestaff, or even the general
manager, to ask questions about products
instead of having to go through 20 differ-
ent corporate offices. F

“Thesame idea you have for local food is
applied to the co-op rather than any mass-
market chain, in that you want local infra-
structure, local buying power, and local
ideas able to be thrown at people and not
just instantly thrown away,” Leiden said.

Leiden acknowledged that this access
is exceptional for most of the institutions
that dominate our day—to—day activities.
Food, though, is a big part of our lives.

7 “I would say my interest in food — and
ﬁnding cool places to buy cool food — is
that food affects the world more than any-
thing. Everyone eats. Food is the largest
factor of environmental degradation. It’s
one of the largest factors of third—world
disempowerment,” Leiden said.

“It’s one of the largest factors of — ob-
viously — animal cruelty. It plays a part
in every infrastructure, whether you’re in
central Pennsylvania or San Francisco, and
it should really be something that adds a
solution rather than more problems 
And_I think the co-op is one of the best so-
lutions ever.” _ .

Christine Johnson would agree — she
is the Northeast regional organizer of the
Cooperative Food Empowerment Direc-
tive, and she travels to different univer-
siti_es to help students start up co-ops at
their schools. Johnson visited Pittsburgh

to help a student at Chatham University *

begin developing a food co-op. . . ‘

“We don’t necessarily demand that stu-
dents focus on local foods,” Johnson said.

“We have no overarching demands: Some

non—local and some do 50 percent organic

and maybe 20 percent that is not organic,

to make pricing more affordable.”

Johnson explained that she is usually

February 28, 20W 2 | The Pitt News fl vx/vwv.piitoevvs.Com

contacted by interested students and pro-
vides them with information to help their
game plans: She provides information on

grants, money, space — everything that

makes a food co-op feasible. She explained
that it varies depending on the school: the
campus structure and the food stores avail—.
able. For universities with urban environ-
ments, it is harder to ﬁnd the space needed.

Chatham University’s newly acquired
Eden Hall now houses the School of Sus-
tainability and the Environment. The uni-
versity offers a master’s program in food
studies that focuses on food systems: sus-
tainable agriculture, food production and
culinary examination. With a welcoming
environment for a co-op, Chatham is one
university where Johnson plans to extend

her efforts. _

CoFED began the Real Food Challenge,
a campaign spearheaded by students, to
increase the amount of “real food” on col-
lege campuses by creating a network to le-
verage buying power and increase control
of food. The challenge’s organizers want to
shift industrial-junk-food budgets at uni-
versities toward healthy, local, sustainable
food sources. ,

There are some large corporation gro-
cery stores that boast organic selection,

and Johnson explained that they can rely.

on marketing. The university co-ops that
she helps are not for proﬁt, and any proﬁt
garnered is used to help build up other co-
ops or to improve the co-op rather than to
produce future proﬁt through marketing.

ii

“There is cooperation among the coop-

_erative,” Johnson said. “In the co-op com-

munity, those who are more attracted to it
are more empowered.”

On East End Food Co—ops’s website,
there are speciﬁc farms with their exact lo—»
cation listed under “Where Our ___ Comes
From” for produce, meat and cheese. This
is more information than most consumers
get from other food suppliers.

According to Baran and Leiden, who
both choose to participate in a food co-_
op, they do not preach about it and do not
think such promotion would help. They
each choose to live the way they do and
hope others see the beneﬁts as well. As
parting advice, Leiden offered: “Cook with
your friends — it’s fun.” ﬂ ’

=A GRAIN OF _SAliI.

 

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Over the last few years, fandom
has been under attack.
Die—hard sports fans have been
called crazy. Their morals are in
question. The general public feels
"fhey have too many emotional
ties to their teams. But what goes
into this fandom? * f

In the last decade, we’ve seen it
all. - ' I .
In 2011, a Phillies fan was tased
:-at center ﬁeld after running onto

the diamond in the middle of a

game.

Between 19'97 and 2003, West
Virginia fans led the nation in
intentionally—set street ﬁres with

.m1,12o of them.

Less than a month ago, 79 fans
in Egypt were killed during a
soccer riot. Just two weeks ago,
those same Egyptians rioted
against police after reports of
“inadequate” security at the

':»arena. _

’ While the reaction to these
headlines has been a combination
of “How could they?” and “What
are_ they thinking?” the real

The sacrifices

question people should be asking
is, “Why?” .
Why are fans so attached to
their teams? Why are they so
emotionally invested in their
sports?Whatcouldpossiblycause
a person to hate an opposing
fan to the point of beating him,
causing a coma, in the parking lot
of a pre-seasonfootball game?
The sports world isn’t “just a
game” anymore. A saying like

that, today, doesn’t apply,

Fans ’ invest time, money,
emotions and pride into the
team they follow. These things all
have real~life value. Think about

.the other things you put time,

money, emotions and pride into:
relationships, politics, religion,
family, and even education.

Seldom are we asked to take
these things lightly. Yet , just
because it is an arena of wins and
losses, sports fans are assumed to
be “over—invested” in their teams
because they care enough to act
stupidly, violently or irrationally
at a moment of sports crisis.

As a fan, I can’t say I understand
— or can even fathom ~ putting
myself in a life or death situation
over a sporting event. The 79 dead

reveled in

and repercussions of la

in Egypt is an anomaly to me. But,
ifI were to tell you that I’d never
acted out in aviolent or emotional
way over sports, I’d be lying.
Enough can’t be said about the
connection a person can feel
for their sports teams. They

' aren’t just a representation of

the players, but they are also a
representation of the city. If that
city is somewhere you call home,
then those players become a

"representation of you, yourfamily
' and sometimes your character.

In the 1970’s, the Broadstreet
Bullies put Philadelphia Flyers
hockeyonthemap.Butatthesame
time, everyone in Philadelphia
this tough-guy
mentality that the Flyers brought

to the ice. The orange and black,

wasn’t just representing the city,
but they were representing the
character of the city. I ‘

In Philadelphia, who do you
think people care more about,
the mayor or the quarterback? It’s,
not just there — it’s every major
city in America. I bet there are
more people in Pittsburgh who
know who Ben Roethlisberger is
than Luke Ravenstahl.

The reason for this is simple:

eing a fan

 

Bobby Mizia I Senior ‘otafl"I‘lm1 mg:-nj)l1e:*
The Oakland Zoo is known to be one ofthe rowdiest crowds in college basketball. But where should fans d1*a\\r'.tl1e line?

Mayor Ravenstahl puts the
Steelers on a pedestal (i.e. doing
things like temporarily changing
his last name to avoid connection
with Steelers’ rival the Baltimore
Ravens), but you never hear the
Steelers talk local politics. We
ﬁnd pride in our players, not our
politicians.

As a die—hard Redskins fan, I’ve
had to live in fandom depression
for 20 years. The Redskins stink.

They haven’t won a Super Bowl ’

since the year I was born, and the
last time‘ they even threatened to
be good I was wearing braces.
But when somebody insults
the Redskins, I feel the pain and

frustration of all those losses;

I think of what a great city
Washington D.Cl, is and what a
prideful institution the Redskins
once were, and: I actually feel

a real, tangible emotional
connection to that team. V
Aside from ‘the emotional

investment is the monetary one.
A ticket for an: NFL game can
cost as much as $300. For most
Americans, that”isn’t an hour’s
worth of work._jSo when they
get to the game,yyou know what
those paying fans want to see?

“A triumph. A victory. A good
product.

After all, professional sports
have turned into nothing more
than a product. The players
are motivated by money. The
coaches are motivated by money.
The networks are motivated by
money. In some cases, even the
referees are motivated by money.

So while the owners can scold
their fans and ask - for better
behavior, maybe they should
consider this: if you want people
to be less invested, they should
make being a fan less of an
investment.

If it weren’t impossible to meet
afavorite player or get a ticket for

a reasonable price, these events ’

wouldn’t be a once-in-a—lifetime
experience with so much riding
on them.

As the word “athlete” continues
to become synonymous with
the word “celebrity,” those in
the sports world need to start

thinking about how to ﬁx our ,

fans, rather than just scold them
for misbehaving. ‘

Of course, they could always just
cut down on the alcohol  but
who am I kidding? I

Panthers club hockey season ends abruptly in the Backyard Brawl

By Pete Blais
Staff Writer

One goal separated the Pitt men’s hockey
team from continuing its season Sunday
afternoon -5 and; it was West Virginia’s.
WVU scoredthe only goal of the game
to knock Pitt out of the College Hockey
Mid—America Playoff Tournament
championship, marking the third Pitt loss
to the Mountaineers in-four meetings this
season. 9

’_ Pitt ﬁnished the season 21—10—1 overall, a

with an in-conference‘ “record of 10-
5. Instead of the Panthers, it’ll be the
Mountaineers moving on to the American
Collegiate Hockey AssociationlDivision I
Tournament to face Rutgers this weekend.
“Last time we played, they /scored in the
last “minute and it went to a shootout,”
West Virginia goalie Rob Borcky said. “I’m
glad it ended when it did this time.” _A
A Despitethe tough loss, Pitt couldn’tlhelp
but "reﬂect positively on a strong season.

 at the

 

setlE‘iri‘g':i.a..season for right wing Robby
McDyre‘(now Pitt’s all—time points leader
with 116 career points, 66 of them, this
season"), the Panthers worked their way to
third place in the conference and a chance
to play for the CHMA title.

As a _ senior and captain of the squad,
McDyre said he couldn’t ask for anything
more from his teammates.

“I’m. really proud of these guys and what
were able to do this season,” McDyre said.

After beating up on both Slippery Rock
University (8-1) andjohn Carroll University
(5-1) in consecutive nights, the Panthers
knew they had a tough opponent ahead of

am" ‘ornpete with ,

them in Sunday’s matchup.

The Panthers were 1-2 against WVU in
the regular season, and Pitt Head Coach
Stu Rulnick expected another hard—fought
game.

“They [West Virginia] have some great

speed, and they’re real physical,” Rulnick ,

said before the game. “Last time we played,‘
we had a lot of trouble getting the puck out
of our own end.” I 1‘

His words‘ would ultimately come true
again for Pitt, as the Mountaineers seemed
to controjl}5,tirney,on attack for much of the
game antﬂf-ont¢shot Pitt 39-24. But much
credit is due to.Panther goalie Rob Behling
who — despite taking 39 shots — only let
one get by him. ,_

Behling, was unavailable for cdmment
after the?g;-nae. '  I

That oneand only goal of the game came
at the 10548 mark in the ﬁrst period as
Mountaineer forward Conor Frei‘ skated

1 across theiniicldle of Pitt’s zone yandyripped
a wrist shotffrom about 15 ‘feet away, ‘

and into the goal.

‘As ’a result, Freilwas awarded with the
tournament’s Most Valuable Player award,

" - acknowledged the quality hockey that had ‘

been played. .
“It was a great hockey game for both
teams,” Mecs said. “You all should be real

_ proud of yourse1ves.”

Rulnick also acknowledged his team’s
play after the game. ‘

“There’s nothing we could do,” Rulnick
said. “We fought. This game didn’t come
from a lack of effort.”

Pitt thought it had tied the score when,
on a power play early in the third period,
forward Phil Trombetta found the back of
the net with a mid—range forehand.

However, the referee waved off the goal

because McDyre had interfered with
Borcky on the shot.

. “The goalie went to go change positions

and bumped me, then gave a nice little ﬂop
which caught the ref ’s eye,” said McDyre. “It
was kind of incidental contact. I was trying

to gain position and he ran into me.”

Coach Rulnick was also a bit mystified by
the call.

“My guy said the goalie wasn’t in the
crease,” Rulnick said.’ “I didn’t think
interference could be called.”

Regardless of the call, Pitt kept its energy
up and created chances for much of the

teammates possessed a strong sense of
urgency after the second iritermission.

“I knew coming into thisweekend this was
going to be my last hockey game,” McDyre
said. “I think we left it all out there.” 3

‘ FOOTBALL

Chryst complet

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt" football head coach Paul
Chryst completed his ‘coaching
staff on Monday by hiring
Desmond Robinson as running
backs coach and Brooks Bollinger
as quarterbacks coach. '

Robinson will be returning
to Pittsburgh after playing

ﬁve seasons with the Panthers
(1974-1978) as a linebacker
and defensive end. He was a
member of the 1976 team that
was unanimously selected the
National Champions.

The Pitt alumnus has racked up
30 years of coaching experience

since leaving Pitt. He has coached ‘

at Notre Dame, Syracuse,
Connecticut,WestVirginia,Tulane
and Dartmouth. He also had
experience coaching professional

football with NFL Europe.
“Desmond’s Pitt ties and

extensive coaching experience

are going to be invaluable to
our program on and off the
ﬁeld,” Chryst said in a statement
released by the University. “He is
an excellent teacher of the game,
and our running backs will greatly
beneﬁt from his guidance.”
Bollinger, who started at
quarterback for four years at
Wisconsin (1999-2002) — the

last school Chryst coached at —
is coming in after eight years in
professional football. .1

He played three seasons for the
New York Jets after they drafted
him in 2003 and then spent time
with both Minnesota and Dallas
before ﬁnishing his pro career

-‘with the Florida Tuskers of the

UFL. _
His only coaching experience
comes from his one—year tenure

‘as , Minnesota’s .Hill—Murray

es coaching staff with Robinson, Bollinger  

School, where he served as head
coach and led the team to a‘ 9-3
record and its first state playoﬁi
berth in 24 years.

“Brooks knows ﬁrsthand the
mental and physical preparation
neededforsuccessfulquarterback
p1ay,” Chryst said. “He was a
consummate leader for us at
Wisconsin before going on to pro '
football, and those experiences
are going to be assets for our
players and staff.” I
