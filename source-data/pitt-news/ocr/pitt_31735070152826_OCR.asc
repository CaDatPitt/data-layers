Rich Engler reflects on career in music industry

Rich Engler saved his ‘backstage passes and
a few ticket stubs from the ﬁrst four years
of his musical career, but after receiving a
signed guitar from Bob Dylan, he came to
a realization.

“I should have been doing this all along,”
Engler said.

And for the next 40 years, he did.

Since the late 1970s, Engler, 67, has been
collecting signed guitars while working as
a booking agent and promoter throughout

Pittsburgh. Engler’s collection, which in-
cludes 18 guitars and four museum pieces,
were on display in the William Pitt Union
Kimbo Art Gallery on Monday. Pitt Program
Council organized and hosted the event.

Each instrument featured signatures
from musical artists such as Paul Mccart—
ney and ‘N Sync.

Engler’s recent memoir, Behind Stage
Doors: A Promoter’s Life Behind the Scenes,
which was published last December, was
also available for purchase at the exhibit.

Inspiration for the memoir came from
his colorful career in the music industry.

“Every time I’m around people, they’re
like, ‘Rich, tell me a story,”’ he said.

After 30 years of his /friends recommend-
ing he write a book, Engler spent three years
documenting almost half a century in the
music industry. S _

The memoir depicts how Engler launched
his own booking agency at age 21. A native
of western Pennsylvania, Engler grewyup
in Creighton, located in Allegheny County,
and attended Carnegie Mellon University
in 1966.

Chancellor

Nordenberg

to speak at
commencement

Natalie Daher
News Editor

Contrary to recent news, Mark Nordenberg
will be Patrick Gallagher’s successor — as Pitt’s
commencement speaker this spring.

The Pitt community didn’t know Gallagher
-would succeed Nordenberg when the recently
announced Chancellor-elect spoke at Pitt’s
graduation last year. 1

Nordenberg, whose 37-year career at Pitt
will conclude with retirement in August, will
deliver remarks at this year’s ceremonies on
April 27. _

Nordenberghas served as the University’s
chancellor for 19 years. Provost Patricia Bee-
son recommended him to the Special Comrnit—
tee for Honors Convocation and Commence-
ment Speakers, according to a University
press release, and the committee endorsed
the proposal.

“Given his strong and sustained comrnit-
ment to enhancing the overall student expe-
rience at Pitt, we agreed that he would be the
ideal choice to deliver remarks at what will
be his ﬁnal commencement as chancellor,”
Associate Chancellor Vijai Singh, who chairs
the special committee, said in the release.

Nordenberg joined the faculty of Pitt’s
School of Law in 1977. He gradually moved up

ENGLER

Scheduling rising stars such as Janis Jop-
lin, Chicago and Santana, Engler brought
fresh talent to colleges, fraternities and high
school venues around Pittsburgh in the late
19605.

“Some of these acts nobody had ever
heard of, but they’re coming —— they’re com-
ing up fast,” Engler said.

Engler transitioned to his job as a pro-
moter in 1973, forming DiCesare-Engler
productions to publicize concerts and fes-
tivals primarily in the Pittsburgh area with
his partner, Pat DiCesare, 76. He booked
acts, paid for the necessary expenses of the
venue, including stage fees, and sold tickets.
Clear Channel Media and Entertainment, a
divisionof the private mass media company
based in San Antonio, Texas, bought the
company in 1998.

Engler currently operates his own com-
pany, Engler Entertainment, Inc., based in
Sewickley, Pa. He continues to search for
breakout artists in today’s music scene. He
follows young European bands and Elec-
tronic Dance Music acts, such as Daft Punk.

By the end of a show, he receives approxi-
mately 15 to 20 percent of the leftover rev-
enue from an event.

“So it’s a sink, swim operation — being
a promoter,” Engler said.

Engler has become accustomed to taking
risks, including DiCesare—Engler’s purchase
of a Downtown theater more than three
decades ago.

While working in the unpredictable mar-
ket, Engler took a gamble in 1977 on the
Stanley Theater, located on Liberty Avenue,
which reopened as the Benedum Center in
1987.

“The Stanley was a 3,900 seat, beautiful,
beautiﬁil, theater and no one could ﬁll it,
but us,” he said.

By bringing in rock and jazz acts, Engler
ﬂipped the ﬂoundering movie theater into
the number one theater in the country, ac-
cording to Billboard Magazine.

While working with countless legendary
acts, including Bruce Springsteen, The Who
and Guns ‘n Roses, Engler experienced an
array of interesting encounters. '

Among the numerous fascinating acts
was Bob Marley. He produced the last Mar-
ley show in Pittsburgh at the Stanley Theater

in 1980.

“Its and dear to my heart,” Engler said. “I
wrote avery heartfelt story in my book about
how he got through the show. He just seemed
to know in his mind that it was his last.”

After the show, Marley left for Germany
to treat a brain tumor, which took his life
in 1981.

Engler will never forget promoting the
Rolling Stones on their “Steel Wheels” tour,
which took place in the summer of 1990, in
which the band brought “gigantic” inﬂat-
able women.

“WhenI say gigantic — these inﬂatables
had to be three stories tall. They were like
ﬂoats at a Macy’s Day Parade, but, although
they were cartoonish, they were very lifelike.
One was smoking a cigarette with holes in
her stockings... It was like Godzilla!”

Students entering the exhibit at Pitt were

ﬂoored by the quantity and quality of the ’

artists featured on the guitars.

Mya Hogan-, PPC’s lecture director, and
Maddie Blom, PPC’s advertising director, left
the exhibit in shock.

“He has legends in there,” Hogan, a se-
nior majoring in psychology, said.

Blom, a senior studying marketing and
ﬁnance, agreed, adding that she found her
one—on-one exchange with Engler enlight-
ening.

“I think it’s cool that [Engler’s] here so
that you can talk to him if you have any ques-
tions about these amazing legends,” Blom
said. V

Ben Wahlberg, ajunior majoring in psy-
chology, plans to revisit the exhibit when
Engler returns to the gallery on March 26"

Nordenberg has been credited with bol-
stering the University’s reputation for high—cal-
iber research, increasing student enrollment
numbers, acquiring substantial philanthropic
support and leading Pittas its Athletic Depart-
ment’s prestige increased.

He’s extended the University’s reach be-
yond its campus, too, by cultivating relation-

ships with UPMC, the Pittsburgh Steelers and

Carnegie Mellon University. I V

Through thesepartnerships, Nordenberg
has gained recognition that surpassed his role
as an academic leader.

Nordenberg was selected as Pittsburgh’s
Person of the Year in 1998 based on a poll of
1,800 corporate and civic leaders. Pittsburgh
Magazine named Nordenberg “Pittsburgher
of the Year”'in 1999 for his leadership and
regional connections. He was awarded the
title again two years laterfor his collaborative
work  then-Camegie Mellon President

Besides his other achievements, the pres-
ence of Nordenberg’s name on campus will
remain beyond his tenure at the University.

The 2007 Student Government Board dedi-

Rohith Palli
Columnist

No one wants to tax the middle class.
Conservatives generally don’t believe in
taxes, and liberals often believe in taxing
the wealthiest citizens. We can and should,
however, raise taxes for everyone —— but not
income taxes.

Taxation in the United States must be
utilized to rearrange incentives. This re-
arrangement can be leveraged to not only
raise revenues but also effect positive soci-
etal outcomes such as less smoking, less car-
bon emission and healthier eating habits.

The market may correct itself in terms
of monetary costs of goods and services,
but these monetary costs will not always
reﬂect the true costs, which is to say that the
amount of money paid for something does
not reﬂect the ﬁill toll it takes. On a small
scale, buying an ice cream cone might cost

$2, but if it takes 20 minutes to get to the
ice cream store, the true cost of that cone
should include those 20 minutes. On a larger
scale, the price of gasoline reﬂects the value
on the global market, transportation costs,
reﬁnement costs and taxes, but not the toll
that burning that gasoline will take on the
environment.

In the case of carbon emissions, a carbon
tax could rearrange incentives to reﬂect the
true costs, rather than merely the monetary
cost, of gasoline and other emissions. Brit-
ish Columbia has already implemented such
atax of $30 per metric ton of carbon dioxide
emitted. With this tax, they have reduced
emissions almost 10 percent without any
economic consequences.

I think such innovations could take place
in other industries, as well. We should tax
anything that has a higher social cost than
ﬁnancial cost: bullets, carbon emissions and
especially high fructose corn syrup. Extant

evidence from studies involving rats sug-
gests that high fructose corn syrup can be
addictive and that it can be more fattening
than an equal caloric intake of table sugar.

Both of these facts make sense. It is well
known that fructose activates sweet recep-
tors at a greater level per unit than table
sugar. Additionally, fructose cannot be uti-
lized by the body like glucose and must ﬁrst
go to the liver to be processed, often ﬁrst
into liver fat. Hence, epiderniologically, the
consumption of high fructose corn syrup is
bad and carries a signiﬁcant medical and
human cost.

. The key to effective policy here is to
make this cost felt ﬁnancially. Producers
who choose to use high fructose corn syrup
should be forced to take this additional cost
into consideration when choosing whether
to add sugar or corn syrup to their products.

In this manner, we bring into line the
current “cost” of an action (how much the

souls of corporations with effective tax systems

materials to make the item cost) and the
more important societal cost (the net effect
of the creation of the product that includes
the use of the initial materials and the nega-
tive consequences).

The ﬁrst counterargument is clearly that
these taxes will lower consumption and
thereby lower gross domestic product. This
theory, however, rests on the idea that GDP
effectively reﬂects value in society. In reality,
GDP only reﬂects material value; it tells us
how much stuff we made, but not how much
it hurt the planet or our health to do so.

As conservative voices such as David
Brooks have long pointed out, with in-
creased societal freedom has come the
corollary decrease in societal ties. Previ-
ously, these social bonds ensured that busi-
nesses, which were made up of individual
community members, kept the best inter-

ests of the collective in mind. Loosened of
these shackles, corporations are no longer
collections of people from a community,
but themselves industrious people blindly
reaping proﬁt.

Hence, these taxes must seek not only
to raise revenue — though they will —— but

rather to create a business culture that ac- »

counts for extra material costs. In essence,
they should aim to imbue a soul unto the

soulless corporate persons who inhabit the
global business landscape.

But why should this rearrangement stop
at disincentivizing bad behavior? Don’t
sticks work better when paired with carrots?

For businesses, creating value for cus-
tomers is always rewarded. When a busi-
ness is perceived as providing beneﬁts for
society, it is often rewarded by the market.
Though this is not always the case ‘— con-
sider all the failed solar companies I— it

can be, as seen in the cases of Chipotle and

Toms. When it sells a pair of shoes, Toms

donates a pair. This is a selling point that
helps attract customers. In the case of
Chipotle, whose ingredients are organic,
local1y~grown and sustainably raised, the
business is able to reap proﬁts by going
against the typical restaurant-chain proto—,
col. In both these cases, it seems as if good
behavior is rewarded to the extent that it is
economically viable. - if '7

Apart from this, a deeper reason for onlyil

having disincentives via taxation is that our
laws work the same way. People are expected

not to cause others harm, but not to allbe g

7 model citizens. In fact, the law builds in

no special privileges for model citizens.
Hence, in applying tax pressure upon the
economy, the same principles should apply.

._ We use ﬁnancial consequences to enforce
, 5 the principle of “do no harm” rather than the

-principle that everyone should be the ideal.
All that is to say we should pay more

In ‘The Last of Us: Left Behind,’ players are encouraged to use stealth and firearms while playing as 14-year-old Ellie. Photo courtesy of Naughty Dog

‘The Last of Us’ continues with a compelling origin story

Stephanie Roman
For The Pitt News

“The Last of Us: Left
Behind” expansion
Developer: Naughty
Dog, ‘

Grade: A

Snow lightly covers piles of dead leaves as the A

season shifts from fall to winter, andJoel’s just
been hurled from asecond—story window by
a rival human survivor. He lands on a piece
of wreckage, a metal beam that impales him
straight through the gut. It’s 2033, 20 years
after the apocalypse, and resources are so
important that people kill for them. But
Joel, hardened as he is, can’t live long with
his abdomen punctured. His only source of
salvation comes in the form of 14-year-old

Ellie, whom he has been hired to protect and

* transport.

“Left Behind” picks up right in this mo-
ment — in the unexplained segment transi-
tioning between the fall and winter chapters
of “The Last of Us.” Though it’s tempting to
write 'off"‘Left Behind” as an afterthought, it
ﬁilly embraces the best aspects of “The Last of
Us” ~— its story, direction, voiceovers, music
and art design. Basically, everything.

“Left Behind” is the download-only
additional content to developer Naughty
Dog’s PlayStation 3 exclusive “The Last of
Us,” which originally launched injune 2013
to universal critical acclaim. Set in a post-
apocalyptic United States, the main storyline
spans from east—coast locales such as Boston
and Pittsburgh to Colorado. The apocalypse
was caused by the Cordyceps fungus, which
gradually turns people into violent, zombie-
like monsters. A corrupt, authoritarian police

force presides over quarantine zones that
serve to protect the remains of humanity
from the infected, but the police are opposed
by a resistance group called the Fireﬂies. The
leader of this resistance force, Marlene, asks

Joel to transport Ellie —— who is immune to
Cordyceps and could be the only hope for a
cure — to Colorado.

In the “Left Behind” expansion, the player
controls only Ellie, but otherwise the game
retains the same mechanics from the main
campaign, such as crafting Molotov cocktails,
smoke bombs and health kits to increase ef-
fectiveness against enemies and collecting
artifacts, handwritten notes and photographs
to piece together unseen characters’ stories
(in this case, it’s the tragedy of four military
commandos). Ellie is younger, smaller and
weaker than the game’s protagonist,]oel, and
experiences difﬁculty with melee combat,
which makes the game more about stealth

than bludgeoning. Fortunately, for those
disinclined to be sneaky, there are many
sizeable caches of gun and bow ammuni-
tion to discover. But the best combat twist is
that ﬁmgus-infested monsters now populate
the same areas as the humans hunting Ellie,
something unseen in the original game, and
a small noise such as dropping a brick or a
bottle can send the two groups into a slugfest.

The settings, which include two malls (one
in Boston and one in Colorado) harken back
to the imagery of George Romero’s zombie
classic “Dawn of the Dead,” and “Left Behind”
beautiﬁilly captures the decay, overgrowth
and waterlogging a shopping mall would
experience over 20 years of abandonment.
Similarly to the full game, “Left Behind” la-
boriously details billboards, stores, posters

Arcade Fire plays Pittsburgh, formal dressrequest a success

Shawn Cooke
Staﬂ Writer

When Arcade Fire announced its massive
2014 arena tour last November, they band
members attached a special request for
their fans: “Night of show: Please wear
formal attire or costume.” But not every-
one was charmed by the request.

Many cynics described this as yet
more posturing from one of the biggest,
and in their eyes, most pretentious bands
in the world. “Who are they to tell me
what to wear? I’m an independent person
who loves ‘independent’ music,” some

might have thought.

Part of what seemed off-putting about
Arcade Fire’s dress—up party was that it
initially looked like a domineering man-
datory order from people who should
be concerned with the music, ﬁrst and
foremost.

They stressed how “super not manda-
tory” the whole affair was after the initial
backlash, but still highly encouraged fans
to join them. In an interview with the
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, band member

Arcade Fire created an uproar when they asked fans to show up in costume.

Richard Reed Parry had a playful analogy
for detractors: “You can also not bring
Christmas presents to Christmas and see
how fun that is.”

But something funny happened last
Wednesday night at Arcade Fire’s Con-

sol Energy Center show: Hardly any of
those naysayers showed up. Either that,
or they gave into the mania and wore a
costume anyway.

By the always-reliable eyeball esti-
mate, about 70 percent of Pittsburgh con-

cert-goers were in some type of costume
or formal dress, a ﬁgure thatfar exceeded
my expectations. Sure, I was standing
at the front of the ﬂoor — a place often
reserved for the most devoted megafans
and disciples — but even a majority of
the seated section was sporting black-
tie apparel. A -

My friend and I both opted for the for-
mal—attire masquerade look, with skinny
ties and decorated white masks. With
my limited artistic ability, Ijust taped a
ghostly visage of frontman Win Butler cut
out of paper over the white mask, which
others thought might lead to my arrest
due to its Michael Myers resemblance.

Some may have participated begrudg-
ingly, just to not feel out of place or get
dirty looks from the more dedicated mas-
queraders, but everyone who dressed
up seemed to be enjoying themselves in
what was one of the more relaxed concert
environments I’ve ever witnessed.

taking the time to poke into every corner and

-collect the scattered stories, especially early

on in Ellie and her best friend Riley’s excur-
sion.

A What differentiates “Left Behind” from
simply being a cheap add—on is that its sto-
rytelling is partly retrospective. In short, it’s
Ellie’s origin story. “Left Behind” alternates
between current-day sequences full of com-
bat and hunts for medical supplies and the
events in Ellie’s life prior to the “The Last of
Us.” It begins when Riley, Ellie’s roommate
at military boarding ‘school, returns after a

than just a concert,l5ut a real event‘? High ‘

school proms, banquets and Halloween
parties have demanded a particular type of
dress long before indie-rock bands started
playing arena shows. T

A huge costume party ﬁts remarkably
well into Arcade Fire’s ethos. The band has
always made huge communal songs with a
“we’re all in this together” mantra, so why
not unite together in dress? The Reﬂektor
Tour is meant to be a dance party for the
misﬁts —— those who wouldn’t necessarily
feel comfortable at a 21st-century bump-
and-grind. This is their prom — a prom
where attendees are allowed to look like
they just came from a_]ay Gatsby bash, a
long day at the office or the universe of
Robot Unicorn Attack.

As it did on its masterful ﬁrst record,
Funeral, the band wants to create the
most inclusive environment imaginable,

Once the dancing was over, the confetti

from all the screaming and shouting, the
Arcade Fire show left plenty of room for,
well, reﬂection. For fans of the band, it
can be a life—aﬂirming event —— one that

whatever “it” may be. The dry cleaning’s

girls’ relationship after afalling out they’d had
beforehand. The two roam through an aban-
doned mall in the Boston quarantine zone as
a means of farewell, as Riley tells Ellie she’s
being sent away permanently. The charisma
Riley carries makes her immediately likable.
She’s just as, if not more, badass than Ellie,
and the narrative that unfolds during their
exploratory adventure is heart-wrenching,

beautiﬁil and as horrifying as the original
game’s best moments. Most surprisingly, the q

scenes with Riley -4 though never relaxing
4 produce the closest thing to tension-free

fun in “Left Behind.”

While Ellie’s banter with Joel gradually
becomes endearing over the course of the
original game’s 10-hour main storyline, see-
ing her witticisms play off another girl her
age from the outset of the expansion shows
an entirely different side of EHie’s personality.
Ashleyjohnson reprises her voice and mo-
tion capture as Ellie, reviving the character’s
spunky spiritwithas much fervoraswas pres-
ent in the original story. But, because this is
partly a prequel, Neil Druckmann’s writing
and Johnson’s performance craft Ellie into
a typical teenage girl who has time to worry

about her relationships and her body because
her survival isn’t immediately threatened.
Newcomer Yaani King provides Riley’s like-
ness and delivers her with as much ﬁnesse
as every previous supporting character. As
is the case with everything Naughty Dog has
developed, the quality is impeccable.

Though “Leﬁ: Behind” costs a hefty $14.99
on the PlayStation Store, the extrathree hours
of gameplay tell a nuanced and heart—crushing
story on parwith the source material. Riley’s
dialogue and Ellie’s drive to rescuejoel stick
with you, even after the system’s been pow-
ered off. I

JUCO transfers help one another aketra

Jasper Wilson
Senior Staff Writer

Whenever junior transfer Hobie Harris takes
the mound this season for the Pit baseball
team, chances are afamiliar personwill stand
crouched on the inﬁeld dirt over his left shoul-
der — Matt Johnson, a Pitt inﬁelder and a
fellow transfer.

But the two are more than teammates or
even fellow “JUCO” players -—— they’re room-
mates.

The pair played and roomed together the
past two years at ParisJunior College inTexas
and are now continuingtheir college careers

as Panthers. They remain roommates, albeit ‘

no longer in a dorm room the size of “a little
box”\but in a house at 422 Atwood St.

And now, that bond has taken on.even
greater importance with all of the_adjust-

ments they have had to make, especially the J

increased distance from home. i
“It helps having a dude that you’ve spent
two years with that’s kind of almost family,”

. Harris said.

His friend agrees. -

“I don’tthinkthe transition would’ve been
easy without having somebody from home,”
Johnson said.

Both have adjusted to the new surround- .

ings and team well and are likely to feature in

\ Pitt’s 3 p.m. home opener at Cost Field against

Youngstown State. The two made their ﬁrst «

official joint appearance as Panthers when
Harris pitched in the team’s second game of
the season against Coastal Carolina.

The Panthers clinched the series, and the

players remained conﬁdent in the formula .

they had already established.
“Coming out of the bullpen, after my

warrnup pitches, getting the ball and just
looking around and looking back and see-
ing the shortstop I’ve had behind me for two
years was anotherthing to ease my mind,”
Harris said. “This is what we came here for.”

While the players were initially brought

together at Paris through coach—decided

living arrangements, Harris and Johnson
calledtheirpairinglogical. The two hail from

the same area of Texas — the Dallas-Fort -

Worth Metroplex —- with their hometowns
just 15 minutes apart. They played against
each other countless times during summers
in their teenage years as well as once in high

. school tl1eir senior year.

But while they knew of each other,’ they
didn’t meet until the summer prior to fresh-
man year of college, amonth before they
began their time on campus together.

“It really worked out,” Harris said.

The stats show that they have settled in
on the ﬁeld, as well. V

Johnson started at Pitt at shortstop but
moved to play mostly second base, where
head coach Joe Jordano said he is doing a
“great jo .”

Harris, who played center ﬁeld occasion-
allyhisfreshmanyearinaddition to pitching,

nsition toPitt

is at Pitt solely as a pitcher. He has served a
relief role thus far, making the most appear-
ances of any pitcher on staff (eight), all of
them coming out of the bullpen.
He has a record of 2-3 with one save and
an earned run average of 3.15. '
The academic aspect of the move has gone
well, according to both. Each ﬁnished the
majority of their general education require-
ments while at Paris, allowing them to jump
right into” coursework for their respective
majors — ﬁnance forjohnson and exercise
science for Harris.
' Paris head coach Deron Clark said the aca-
demic facet of making the jump from junior
college to Divisionl is crucial. V
“You gotta give yourself a chance to be
eligible at the next level,” Clark said. “Both
of these guys are off the chart. They just did
a great job of themselves that oppor-

V tunity.’_’ ' ‘ i

The talent and the ability. necessary to

compete at the highest level is not something . 4
 junior college players lack, generally.

“For mostof them, the baseball part is

already there. They’re good players,” he said. 2
“Granted, they have to improve and develop ‘

their skills.”
According to Clark, the whole thing was

made possible by a recruiting service called »

Field Level, which Paris had begun using and
Pitt also used. The service brought the players
to Pittsburgh, more than 15 hours from home.

“As we started to put our roster and play-
ers up there and keeping it updated, Pitt be-
gan to communicate with us on a regular
basis about our guys,” he said. “And of course

Virginia conﬁrms status as conference’s top team in Greensboro

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

One of the biggest conundrums heading

1 Selection Sunday was determining
the team hy of claiming the ﬁnal No.

1 seed. After following up its regular-

season title with winning its first ACC
Tournament championship in 38 years,
Virginia took it without controversy.
The Cavaliers lost four nonconfer-
ence games before the new year, and they
saw a drop in the offensive production
of senior sharpshooter and preseason

all—ACC honoree Joe Harris.

Harris’ scoring hasn’t increased, but
Virginia has escaped losses in all but two
games since.

His point totals may have actually
been tweaked due to Virginia’s slow-
paced offensive attack — or lack there-

of. Virginia owns the 345th—fastest ad-
justed offensive tempo in the country,
according to KenPom.com, so it natu-
rally doesn’t attempt an overwhelming
amount of shots.

things that are immediately pertinent to the
status of a kid.”

Pitt began trying to recruitjohnson in Oc-
tober 2012, and he signed his letter of intent in
November. His ﬁrst contact with Pitt resulted
from a round—robin tournament where Pitt
pitching coachjerry Oakes sawjohnson play.

The process accelerated quickly, a surprise
at ﬁrst tojohnson, who said it often happens
in a long, drawn outfashion for some players.
The forward and direct nature of the approach
was something he came to appreciate.

“If they’re showing that much interest in
me, Iwant to show it back. You gotta go some-
where where you’re needed, not wanted,”
he said.

Harris wasn’t contacted by the coaching
staff until the beginning of spring. An assis-
tant coachtold himto expectto hearfrom the
school because they needed a pitcher. Coach
Oakes had seen him pitch back in the fall dur-
ingthe same game in which he sawjohnson.

Harris’ parents, Bob and Amy Harris, both
attended Pitt-Johnstown andgrew up in west-

land.

After settlingin afewweeks before fresh-
men arrived for orientation, the pair had a
month to get familiar with their new sur-
roundings.

“We were able to get all our stuff up here
and kinda get on our own schedule as far as

going and throwing, working out and getting g

our bodies back in shape,” Harris said. “It
was deﬁnitely a good transition period that
helped us down the road to get used to what
we were doing up here.” 6

They found housing with other baseball
players and have more as neighbors.

“Some of the  that were already here
and the upperclassmen _kind.of took us in,”
Johnson said. “Having them  next door,
too, is really convenientasfarashaving people

‘ over, meeting new people or just having the

em Pennsylvania, butthey didn’texpectt_heir “

son to end up at the main campus some years
later —— and neither did he. '

“I never saw myself going out of Texas,”
he said. .

Right aﬁerjohnson made his decision, the
emotion and attachment he displayed toward
his future school made a positive impression

team in one area to kind of bond and stuff. I
think that’s one of the coolest things about
where we live.’’ 6

One of the biggest adjustments of all, how-
ever, wouldn’t make itselfapparent until later
in the semester: snow.

Following a pleasant fall, the two were in
for a shock upon returning after break. .

“I came back injanuary and was like, ‘This
polar vortex’s gotta go,”’ Johnson said.

. But in truth, the Texansembraced the
snow while it lasted. An example:They made
use of their houses roof to keep their arms
limber. V ‘ ’

_ “We were so intrigued by the snow,”John-
son said. “On Atwood Street, we just made it

A known that it’s a danger zone. If you walk by

on his roommate — a feeling that remained .

when Pitt began targeting him, as well.
“You could just tell [Johnson] was ﬁred

- up. It wasn’t less than a week that we had a

Pitt barmer hanging on the wall of our dorm
room,” Harris said. “This dude is not one
to settle. So there must be something good
going on up there.”

Sitting across from Harris at a table in
the media work room inside the Petersen
Iayents Center, Johnson begins to chuckle at
the memory, intetjecting between laughs that
he made a point that fall to buy a “H2P” block

. letter T-shirt.

Jordano acknowledged that having some-
one familiar on the roster serves as a helpful
recruiting pitch.

“It is obviously easier to get two players
from the same team coming to adifferent part
of the country to play,”_]ordano said.

With both players decided on where they
would head next, the journey would pick back
up in the summer when they arrived in Oak-

our house, you might get a snowball thrown
at you or your car.” '

This child-like joy made the two easy
targets for ribbing from teammates more
accustomed to northern winters.

“Starting injanuary, any time we were
walking back from the Cost Center [after prac-
tice] all the guys from around here were like
‘Do you guys have to make snow balls again?
Grow up,”’ Johnson said.-“We’re like ‘I don’t
care what you say, it’s snown 22 times here,
that’s the 22 ﬁrst snow days we’ve ever ha .”’

Harris said that fromthe time they re-
tumed to campus after holiday break until
the team’s opening day, the team’s ﬁeld was
covered in snow, leading him to anticipate
the Feb. 15 season opener against Coastal
Carolina. He was interested to see just how
everything would go after practicing indoor
for a month.

After the ﬁrst few innings, he had seen
enough.

“We’re ﬁne,” Harris said. I"
