g a m e s , but
' coach Bobby
Lewis remem-
bers that in
1959 his team
received a bid
with a 14-3 rec-
ord. “I don't
think 2010 is
better than 14-
3,” speculated
Lewis. “Just to

 

LEWIS‘
play games shouldn’:t mean that
much.” But Lewis admitted that
anything under 17 or 18 games
is bound to hurt a team’s

chances. —
The‘ mitters ran their reco
to 6-0 with a 2-0 win over Grove

. City and have 12 games left to

play. They already have been
rained out eight times. Lewis
realizes they cannot afford many
more washouts.

Thus, despite constant rain
over the weekend and threaten-
ing weather predicted for this
week, every attempt is being
made to get in the scheduled
games today with St. Francis
and tomorrow with Kent State,
‘both to be played at Leech
Farm. .

The Panthers need these games
not only to try and bolster their
record,,but also to protect their
pitchers, Don Stock and Dave
Welsty. “Its been nine days since
Don pitched, and Dave hadn’~t
pitched for nine days before last
week. It's hard to stay sharp

with this kind of layoff,” ex-

plained Lewis.

Stock is "scheduled to Work
against the Frankies, and Wel-
ty will hurl against Kent. Weath-

er permitting. of course.

Unbeaten   Mitters Face
St. Francis, .Kent State

by MIKE BROURMAN .

In 1948, hampered by what was essentally a two man
pitching staff, the chant of the then Boston Braves was
“Spahn and Sain and a day of rain.” The weatherman co-
operated; Boston won the pennant.

Times have changed; poetry must no longer rhyme, and rain
is all too frequent. Thus, the chant of this year’s Panther’s base-
ball team has become “We1ty and Stock and hope for sunshine.”

Loosely translated, this free verse underlines the fact, that if
the mitters are to reach the NCAA playoffs, they need good pitch-
ing and good weather. And one is as important as the other.

Four teams from the Middle Atlantic area will be chosen for
the NCAA’s, and there are two major qualiﬁcations: a good record
and a reasonable nulnber of games played.

To make the playoffs a team normally must play at least 20
