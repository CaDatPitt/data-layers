UnionsReiect Study Plan

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Three unions vying to represent
the Pitt faculty have rejected a
Senate Council proposal to estab-
lish a study committee on the
impact of faculty unionization at
Pitt.

The Pennsylvania State Educa-
tion Association (PSEA), the Pitt
Professional Union (PPU) and the
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP) all turned down
an offer to participate on thetpanel
for fear of possible legal ramiﬁca-
tions.

The Senate Council proposal
would have established a six-seat
commission composed of three
pro-union faculty, three anti-union
faculty and one Student, and
funded by the University adminis-
tration to undertake an analysis of

the impact of collective bargaining

on Pitt.

According to several union
representatives, the contribution of
University funds to the study
project could create grounds for an
unfair labor practice suit after
elections were held.

“We believe there is a large
possibility that a study as designed
by the Senate Council would be
a violation of Article 12 of Act 195.
The University funding could be
seen, in this particular case, as
interference in the formation of a
bargaining unit,” said PSEA

representative Michael Butera.

“Now the effects of that violation
could be a court case, which might
mean a delay or postponement of
the conclusion of- the collective
bargaining election at Pitt,” Butera
added.

The PSEA, as advised by its
lawyers, decided to remove itself

from participation in the study,‘

although it has offered to pay a
chunk of the cost of a study
committee without the University
monies.

The PPU, which also declined to
participate, was faced by the same

uncertainty about the effects of

University funding of the project.

“To be an employe organization,
you must demonstrate that you are
not dominated by the employer (in
this case the University),” said
PPU’s Van Beck Hall.- “If the
employer gives ﬁnancial aid it
leaves the way open for legal
action.

“To be candid, I simply do not
know if it would be an unfair labor
practice or not, but you can’t take
the chance.”

Hall said there was also some
question of the method by which
the Senate Council’s proposal was
arrived at, and the composition of
the study panel.

“There was no effort to contact
the union or clear this up with us.
Where did the idea came from?
Besides, the PPU has taken a

different position concerning grad-
uate employes than the other two
petitioning agents, and we felt grad
students should’ve been included
on the panel,” Hallsaid.

Hall said the true forums for
issues of faculty unionization are
the ballot box and the upcoming
election campaign.

“I think most of the unions
would go along with some form of
debate on the issues, and I think
the campaign will ventilate all of
the issues,” he said. ‘ '

No representative from the
AAUP was available for comment,
although it has been reported it
also withdrew from any participa-

Fire System To Be Installed

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

A half-million-dollar ﬁre safety
system will be installed in the
Schenley Quadrangle dorms by
September, 1976, according to
Director of Health, Safety and
Parking Joseph Gil.

Resident students .will face an
increase of between $30 and $35
per year over a 10-year period to
pay for the improvements, Gil

explained.
“lnitial funding for the ﬁre,

safety system will come from

borrowing fromexternal or internal
University funds,” said Vice

Chancellor of Budget and Finance
Joe Dutton.

One major improvement on the
existing ﬁre safety system will be
the addition of alternate emergency
exits in the Quadrangle buildings.

“We explored a number of

non-combustible fire hoses--but‘by September 1976, improvements
totaling a half-million dollars will bring the Quadrangle systems up to

alternatives regarding additional
exits,” Gil said. “The one we are
most interested in at this time is
the concept of building bridges at
rooftop level between buildings in
the Quad.” ,

According to Gil, construction on
the alternate exits and other
improvements will begin as soon as
city,approval is received.

Other improvements will include
pressurization of the stair towers to
prevent smoke and gases from
entering the stairways, emergency
lighting, a sprinkling system in the
storage areas and a communica-
tions system allowing communica-
tion from the lobby to ﬂoors.

The new communications system
would be an improvement on the
current ﬁre alarms, Gil Explained.
It would enable residents to be
notiﬁed of exactly where in the
building the ﬁre is located. I

The Quadrangle Residence halls
presently meet legal ﬁre safety
standards due to a grandfather
clause in the law, Dutton said.

The grandfather clause refers to
ﬁre safety regulations set at the
time of the building’s construction.

“Although the Quad area is
legally adequate, it was brought to
our attention they do not meet the

present ﬁre codes,” Dutton said. l

The recommended improve-
ments to the residence halls are the
result of a seven-month study and a
State Board of Labor and Industry
engineering analysis.

The MCNR and Towers residen-
ces meet ﬁre safety regulations,
and the improvements in the Quad
area are expected to bring these
residence halls up to current
standards, Dutton said. V "

students going right along.

It all began with. a Student
Affairs Advisory Council (SAAC)
meeting two weeks past with the

Chancellor and his men introducing ,

the plan.

A few student leaders objected;
the majority agreed.

But student opinion ran opposite
the leaders", and within a day or
two the uproar began.

’ Within the space of a week,
student leaders called for Athletic
Director Casimir Myslinski’s resig-
nation, tapes of the SAAC meeting
were analyzed’ and alleged “.‘Mys-
linski inconsistencies” were re-
vealed, Chancellor Wesley Posvar
and Myslinski released late-night
responses to the student charges, a
possible 810 additional free student
tickets were made available, and a
list of inﬂated demands was
forgotten. '

The SAAC meeting, perhaps,

was the start. For reasons still in

CA3 Advising Director    ;
Appointment Announced‘

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

In hopes of bringing unity to the
fragmented CAS advising system,
the position of Director at Advising
has been newly created and ﬁlled
by Fred Koloc, according to CAS
Dean Robert Marshall.

“There is one advising center on
the freshman-sophomore level,
while on the junior-senior level
there are 33. or more advising
centers,” Marshall said. “Advis-
ing depends largely on the flow of
information and it is feasible that
all these centers are not receiving
the same information.”

The position of Director _ of
Advising was recommended by the
students and faculty of an ad hoc
committee on CAS advising two
years ago. V

advisingfrom the freshman to the
senior level. He hopes the four
years of advising ‘will become a.

Fringe Benefits . . . A

In one way or another, money is the topic that seems to underlie just
about every issue on campus. The two most recent items to surface are
tuition remission and student renumerations.

Currently afringe beneﬁt for Pitt faculty and staﬁ, tuition remission
provides free or lowered tuition for employes and their dependents.
Thepolicywillfaceatoughtestinﬂarrisburg, however,asa,bill
intrudueedbyRepresentativeBillShane[D-Indiana] seekstoeliminate
theprivilege atlall state-ownedandstate-related colleges and

» universities.

I Those who see things in Shane’s view believe the plan costs schools
too much money--money that could be better spent on more worthwhile

items for the student body at large.

While this is possible, it’s also true that tuition remission is one of
those beneﬁts that workers accept in lieu of salary increases. Should
the Shane bill' succeed in the state capital, then those who lose the
beneﬁt undoubtedly will call for a pay raise. And who can blame them?

. . . Activity Benefits

” V, ‘I ~ Not subject to state approval, but an important ﬁnancial program at

Pitt nonetheless, is the new plan to compensate students for work in
extracurricular activities through remunerations. ‘

So far only for student government, and yearbook officers, the policy
may be extended to cover other student leaders, depending on their

volume of work.

will beneﬁt the organizations that benefit students most.

It is wrong, however, to assume, as the Remuneration Board

C chairman does, that remunerations will attract more quality students

. and better leaders to the organizations. _ It goes without saying that
those who really are interested in working at an activity have been

working all along without compensation.

Whomever the new

remunerations attract, it is likely the group will be equally divided into

good workers and bad.

Nevertheless, the extension of remunerations to all worthy groups

has been long overdue.

‘Letter

 

In Defense of UN

Dan Mulholland, in the Pitt
News of 9/10/75, wrote an article

 blasting the UN as a “Fearful

Master'.’ and “Trojan Horse," and
urged the US to get out of the UN.

I  ~-I-leseolds the UN as having been
"unfair -to Israel, Rhodesia, South

Africa, and “Free China." He

‘‘ protests UN inaction at the Russian
I A invasions of Hungary and Czecho-

Slovakia, but expresses no concern

V‘ , about the US invasion of Vietnam.

Much of the article indicates regret
at “no win" wars and blames this

.on a Soviet conspiracy in the UN.

He then indicates that the purpose
of the UN is a conspiracy by
“international bankers and com-
missars" to establish a world

. dictatorship.

With such villainy at the UN and"
unmentionable individuals plan-
ing a conspiracy since 1945, I am
not sure what or whom the
supposed “patriot” Mulholland
espouses. -

At this 30-year juncture of the
UN a closer study might illuminate
Mulholland's selective perspective.

The UN's adequacy as a peace
organization rests on the ability to

_ agree by the superpowers. Though

the UN has been inadequate in
peacemaking, it has achieved much
in peacekeeping.

The US and the West European

, ‘big powers after WWII had their

way in UN affairs for most of the
-.UN's life. Now that the
developing, new nations of the
Southern hemisphere are demand-
ing a greater say in the utilization
of their own resources. the
developed, industrial nations no
longer want to play -the game. No

_ issue could elicit more emotional

backlash in the,US than the threat
that other nations may not share
the uncritical romance the US has
.with the State _of Israel. _which

,g-an.» ..--...4 ,....-..s..-.... ...>.. .. .4 .. ,.>.....,...w. .

denies basic human "rights ‘to the

Palestinian people under its mili-
tary occupation.

The UN specialized agencies,
numbering about 43, have wide
international responsibilities in

economic, social, cultural, educa-

tional, health and related fields.

There are many issues that cannot
and should not be dealt with on a
strictly nationalisticor even region-
al basis: eg, ‘-the international
economic order, population, food,
racial discrimination, the law of the
sea, the human environment, the
role of women in society, transnati-

onal corporations, human settleé -

mcnts, natural resources, energy,
human rights, etc. We are not only
physically and economically inter-
dependent, but we must also face
up to our political interdependence.
Up to now each nation individually
has determined alliances strictly on
nationalistic interests. 
The present task is no longer
properly focused on whether or not
the UN; the present fact of our
interdependence demands it.
Rather the focus should be on how
the UN charter's procedures and
institutions can more effectively
allow the UN to accomplish its
purpose of fostering harmony and
justice among nations. Rather than
retreat to an impractical nationali-
sm or inevitable international
conflict and confusion, we need to
adapt the existing UN institutions
and invent better ones for the
humanistic management of our
international interdependence.
Would Mulholland also advocate
the dissolution of the US govern-
mental structure and a return to
independent States, or municipali-
-tics, or family clans? Or does he
just want to be left alone as a
hermit who sees, reads, and knows
nothing, interacting with himself?

Games in the Mideast

Pass Sinai, Collect $200

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

Amidst the smiles, cheers and
clinking of champagne-filled glas-
ses; Dr. Henry Kissinger basks in
the light of his latest fete, the new
interim peace agreement in the
Middle East. But this golden aura
shrouds the reality of the Middle
East--that any created situation is
wholly dependent on a series of
interlocking and intricate games.‘

The stakes are high, human
life;the players must play with
great elan or run the risk of being
eliminated. Intrigue and suspense
are at their peak, enough to make
the mouths of Milton Bradley and

the Parker Brothers water with .

envy.

The most familiar game, at least
to the American people, is called
“Political Football." Its principle
players are the members of
Congress, with key cameos by
Kissinger and President Ford. The
situation is as - follows: the
Democratic Congress must decide
whether to allow American techni-
cians into Sinai to man Israel's
early warning detection devices.

Passage of this measure could
hand a big political victory to
President Ford. However, if they
do not pass the act, the Democrats
might appear as obstacles to peace
in the eyes of the American public.
Further, the Democrats surely
would lose the support of American
Jewry, a traditional backbone of
the party. So the Democrats are
really in the position of deciding
which play will cost them the least
yardage.

Of course there are a few options
open to them. They could amend
the agreement so that Congress
has the authority to withdraw the
technicians. Or they could pass the
agreement as is and hope that war
breaks out anyway, thus making
Ford look like a fool and causing a
real threat of a second “Vietnam.”
The value of this measure as a step
towards peace never really enters
their calculations.

The Egyptians are playing a
totally different game. Itsname is
“Brcakaway" because the Egyp-
tians are trying to do just that,
break away from the rest of the
Arab world and the influence of the

Pitt, Money, and
_ Football Nlania

Thursday night’s disruption of
Hillman Library by the Pitt
Marching Band (rallying support
for the football team) only adds
further evidence to the fact that at
the University of Pittsburgh foot-
ball takes priority over academics.

The most important question of
the day appears to be which color
coupon will be necessary to get into
the Notre Dame game. Meanwhile
the Athletic Department has the
honor of being the only department
in the University with a blank check
budget, while films for classes are
cancelled due to insufficient funds.

The rationale that the die-hard
jock supporters invariably fall back
on is that Pitt Football brings a lot
of money into Pitt’s coffers; that
the overwhelming amount of this
money is reinvested into football is
mysteriously overlooked. If the
necessity for Pitt Football is to
bring additional revenues into the
University, why not raze the
Cathedral and build a second
stadium? That way Pitt Football
could be expanded and bring in
twice the revenue.

During the depression when
money was tight, the University of
Illinois, like many other colleges
and universities, was faced with

the question of continuing a"

successful football program and
cutting back on academics or
suspending their .football_progt ‘m

A. and concentrating their money into

Soviet Union.

The Eg_yptians want to break
away from the Arab world because
there is no profit in fighting
fruitless war after fruitless war

with Israel. The Egyptians have no
reason to fight for the Palestinians

academics; Illinois chose the latter.
I fear that .if the administration of
Pitt .were faced with the same
choice that academics would be

. suspended in order to maintain

football. It’s time for Pitt to come
to its senses. A. V - v .

No Environment

For the past three or four years,
trudging drearily or racing frantic-
ally to and from classes, I have
been reading those little signposts
on some of the Pitt grounds--“This
shortcut saves only a few steps;
Is_n’t your environment worth
more than that?" Read in a
preoccupied state , of mind, the
words never entered any of the
deeper levels of my mind, but left
me with a feeling similar to the one
I get while noting some of the
scrawlings on the insides of toilet
stalls, that Something Is Wrong
Here. And for three or four years,
it had escaped me. j

Today, in a wild rush of
adrenaline on the Cathedral lawn, I
experienced the Knowledge of
What is Wrong Here. No, my
insight was not amphet_amine-in-
duced, but came while watching a

student in hot pursuit of a Frisbee
run at full speed directly at one of

the above-mentioned signposts.

, forbidden grass,

except humanitarianism, and how
many countries‘ foreign policies
are based on humanitarianism?

Besides, the Egyptians don't even
like the Palestinians. If they did.

.

they would not have kept them '

penned up in “relief" camps for all
those years.

The breakaway from the Soviet
Union is even more desirable
because, as the Egyptians have
learned, Soviet aid comes with too
many strings attached. The
Egyptians would rather play the
middle of the road,‘ milking both
the United States and the Soviet
Union.

Finally, the Egyptians
nothing more to prove by ﬁghting
the Israelis. Honor was satisfied by
a decent showing in the last war, as
a timely ceasefire kept the
Egyptian Fourth army from being
obliterated.

The Israelis are playing a game
called “You Don’t Say," since
lsrael’s policy is being determined
more by what is not being said than
by what is being said. Rabin knows
that the Egyptians do not want
another war, and while he doesnot

‘say so, this is a major reason for his
signing another interim agree-
ment.

He is, in a sense, a party to‘the

Egypt's step-by-step breakaway.

‘Meanwhile, Rabin is playing his
own game, which is best described

turbulent political waters." But
Rabin's doggy paddle usually
leaves him floundering.

All of these games coalesce into
the all-encompassing game of
trying to reach an a'greement. If
the agreement fails, then Rabin
will be sunk and the Egyptians will
come under a barrage of “I told you
so's" from other Arab countries.
And no one ever really knows what-
V is going to happen on the American
political scene anyway.

In any case, be assured that all
players particip te with the full
knowledge that it's alljust a game.
Which, I guess is pretty fright-
ening. A

Blueprints on paper, detailing

Does a beaten path through the

Granted, these paths get muddy
after a thaw or heavy rains, and so I
invite the people who dreamed up
Project Meatcleaver in the Lawn to
take note of the paths that the

several articles in recent Pitt News
concerning the new football ticket.-

walking up Cardiac Hill for too_
many years when Pitt was
mediocre at best to be told that my
opportunity to view a winning,
exciting football team depends
upon my luck in some multi-colored
lottery system.

I am also angered by Chancellor
Posvar’s statement regarding the
demand of several student leaders

"ﬁ_:’r‘esignation. Posvar stated that the

University responds to dialogue,
not to intimidation. I question
strongly whether any true “dia-
logue” was involved in the
announcement of the plan. The

system was presented to many of _

the same student leaders as an
accomplished fact, not to be
modified by any “dialogue.” This
was intimidation on the part of the
University directed upon the
students.

large sense she has been of age for

and intellectual capacity.

These last three qualities seem
to be reserved for determining
one’s (snicker!] manhood. If that
be so, then my daughter is ‘quite a
man. But she is also a lovely,
budding young woman, and the

juxtaposition of all these qualities?
into one person is going to be quite

bewildering to the dummies who
have rigidly constructed narrow
stereotypes of what is “womanly”

and what is “manly.”

But I speak of the formal
recognition of her “coming of
age,” which is that she has gone to
Poland with her father and will be
separated from me for three
months. I don’t ever worry about
her and whether she will be able to
deal with this situation. The
frightening truth is that she is far
better at dealing with the experi-
ence of a foreign country‘ and
separation from her mother than I
was at thirteen--or even at 20.

But, what is she like in Poland,
what is she learning, what will she
know when she comes back, what
will she be when she comes
back--and the far larger question,
will my world be able to accept her
as she is? Will my daughter be
able to come home?

especially the coming of age of our.
young women.
competing with and losing out to__
our young people; we are desper-
ately afraid of being bested by a
young woman. I am no longer a
young woman, butl have never felt

as though I belonged in my own,

country, as. though". were wanted
and accepted the way I am as a
person.

No. We cannot deal with our
young people. We cannot accept
our young womenas persons-. We
try to keep them in limbo in
universities, separated from- the
real world. Or, we send our young
men off to foreign wars without
consulting them, or we try to turn
our young women into “domestic
goddesses,” baby machines, con-

sumers of washers, appliances, »

detergents, muck, garbage and
tranquilizers in order to keep our
faltering economy going and to
feed our war machine with a new
crop of young men.

It is insane, isn’t it? And my
daughter is terribly, terribly sane.
But will she be able to bring her
great sense of sanity into this chaos
of insanity; will she be able tocomc
back? Will my daughter be able tc
come home? Will my country ever
come of age?

What the hell...if you were in
New Ken, what did you come to
Pitt for?

It’s the only school I applied for.
When you went to Pitt did you
have any idea what you went for?
Well, initially I was going to be
an architect (smickers). —I don’t
know why. But I got to Pitt and saw
it just wasn’t what I wanted, ya_’
know? The math and all the

' jive...it just wasn’t me. And I was

always interested in radio because I
lived in New Ken and knew the

‘ people at WYDD and then got to

Pitt and sw there was WPGH and

started there. The good thing
about WPGH is the fact that you
can really learn there if you want
to. You can really learn radio. It’s
not a matter of people listening to
you, but it’s a matter of you
learning it. Which is good.

Why doesn’t anyone listen to
WPGH?

WPGH did really well during the
Kit Baron years because there was
nothing else. There was KQV and
WIXZ but there wasn’t anything
really progressive and people
weren't really into radio back then
like they are now. They did pretty
good. But now ’PGH is up against

-WDUQ (Duquesne’s station),

WYDD and WDVE and everybody
else.

When did you get behind a
microphone, is it weird? _

Let me tell ya’ about when I first
started. I had worked at Pitt for
three years, had done a show there
and did a lot of tapes and Kit had
heard me before at WPGH. I‘ was
always really at ease. My raps
come easily, even more easily at
WPGH than at WYDD. When I
came to WYDD I was so
scared...shitless. I could hardly

even cue up my records my first,

hour, that’s how scared I was.

Why? lmean...

It was just...do you remember
the ﬁrst time you played in front of
peole?

Herschel; WYDD disc jockey and Pitt senior, is a familiar voice, but
an unfamiliar face. His radio career started here on Pitt’s WPGH-, but
as WYDD personnel grew accustomed to his presence, they signed him

on. Now, some say, he is a Star.

them enjoy it. There’s just nothing
else synthetic or organic that you
can put inside of yourself that
makes you feel as good and when I
get that call at the end of my show,
somebody says ‘Hey Hersh, that
was really nice,’ and just leaves it
at that -- an honest compliment,
man it just makes your day. It
makes you feel good because I
really always wanted to perform in
front of people. You know I'm a
superham but I can’t really do it if
somebody’s lookin’ at me. In radio
it’s so easy for me to be able to do

We’re working right now to

and then from there we'll work it

There’s a lot of people at school

Oh, well that was the way I was

Camelot presents . . .

‘Kismet’: A Fisttull of Olives

BY ALAN REHNER

Kismet, presenfed by Camelot
Productions, is a musical Arabian
Nights. Set in ancient Bagdad, it is
the story of Kismet (fate) and the
ways it plays with the lives of a poet

fiend his daughter. Basically, it is an
"-..’3ld-fashioned musical, full of

mistaken identities and love
intrigues.
The score is the kind of music,
whether you like it or not, that
buzzes around in your head hours
after having heard it. Based on the
themes of Alexander Borodin, it
includes such gems as, “Baubles,
lBangles and Beads,” “Stranger in
lParadise,” and “And This is My
Beloved.” When performed,
though, many of the songs are done
with a total lack of energy and
projection. The production ‘num-
bers do not become show stoppers,
but remain as numbers. The
orchestra should be commended.

/,'/“'15,-‘iconsists of a piano, and a set of

.1‘

l‘s..

drums, and no lack of spirit is
evident here.

Some of the ‘low energy is
balanced by the sets and the
costumes. The scenery itself is
quite functional,
painted with bright day-glo colors.
The costumes by Don Difonso, as
well as the characters, burst with
color, making the production a
treat for the eyes.-

As the ‘poet, Jerry Comunale, Jr.
is in ﬁne voice, and stands out of
this production. He plays the
poet/ beggar/ court magician with a
polish and a high level of voltage.

33%-Ie comes across as a real person in

simple and «

popular . music.

the fairytale world that surrounds
him.

His lovely daughter Marsina is
played with charm by Evey
Kehner. She does not project well
on most of her songs, but with the
assistance of a microphone, she
proves that she possesses a fine
voice. Her dancing is done as if she
were in a trance, but she is not
called upon to dance often.

Her lover is Lee Moorehouse, as
the Caliph. When they do
“Stranger in Paradise” together,
the moment itself is almost a touch
of paradise. His voice is quite
capable.and very clear. Their

second number, “And This is My
Beloved,” is well staged and
performed, despite the fact that
she is barely audible until reprising
it as a solo. Their romantic scenes
are played with the innocence
necessary for the fantasy world of
love they exist in.
(Continued on Page 10) .

The autumnal equinox this year
will occur at 11:55 am on Tuesday,
September 23rd. At that moment
the sun will cross the celestial
equator on its journey south
marking the arrival of the fall
season.

‘Grass Roots’ Growing

BY BURR BEARD

It seems that too often in our
strain for bigger and better, shinier
and neater-packaged sound, we
ignore those musicians who are at
the roots of our popular music
trends. Like Joni Mitchell and her
clarinet-playing inspiration by the
quick lunch stand: One gains

recognition and the other satisfac- .

tion of hearing his own tune.
Maybe the traditional musician
does not want to become popular.
But these people do not wish to be
compared to a scene where
pop-musicians are escorted off to
engagements by gentlemen in
limosines. '
,A barrier is created between
these inspirated forerunners and
The traditional

musician is turned off to the
glamour of folk-rock superstars. In
turn, these musicians do not have
the chance to meet and hear their
predecessors in a productive
atmosphere. This absence of equal
exchange creates a state of
embitterment, contradictory to the
true spirit of music.

To these eyes and ears, it seems
someone is being exploited. But
then many of these traditional
musicians come from traditionally
exploited backgrounds in the ﬁrst
place--so why not rip them for their
music too?

There can be though, a fair
exchange created between grass-
roots musician and interpreter.
But it cannot ﬂourish without
respect for each other’s context, for

traditional music can be carried on,

' and brought out from those hills,

deltas and plains and given to some
of us, who crave understanding of
those parts of our heritage worthy

David Bromberg has said it
would have been nice to have been
born another color or in the
southern mountains, because his
favorite music just wasn't being
played in suburban New York.

But just because society has
many traditional
aspects of life, it does not mean
that we cannot continue to play and
hear folk music in a realistic
fashion. It is there: to be listened/
to and to be learned.

tional songs and styles. Here lies
music in its original form, as it has
followed up across the oceans.

One place you might not find
worthwhile visiting, is the local
record buying market. Because
this music is not popular, you will
not find its obscure labels in the
commercial stalls. But if you can
track down these musicians carry-
ing heavy cardboard boxes along
with the familiar instruments, you
may be able to make someone.

happy.

A Get in touch with the record
companies that deal in the material
of these people. These labels
represent a spirit committed to
getting the music listened to, and
their usual non-profit status makes
for a nice atmosphere of trade.
Here are some possible outlets--a
few notes in the mail will yield
some catalogs and some real music
in your ears.

CameIot's ‘Kismet’:

A Handfull of Olives  

(Continued from Page 9)

The play itself shows no signs of
aging thanks to the clever‘ use of
schmaltz in the characters of the
Wazir,~and his wife Lalume. G.
Fred Thickey has his moment in a
song wherein he sings a joyful
summary of'the tortures he has put
countless people through. He
camps his way through this song
and dance with a slight touch of
effeminateness, quite the opposite
vein for this song.

Lalume also has a number that

Lalume is a sultry vamp, though
slightly toned down as portrayed by
Nan Sumner. Her one moment of
shining glory comes in the latter
half of the show when she dons a
costume that would seem very
appropriate at a LaBelle concert, if
not in ancient Bagdad.

some very intricate solo parts the
music remains warm and colorful in
a romantic way.

It opens without the usual
introduction before the entrance of
the soloist, rather the main theme
is stated immediately by the oboe
and echoed by the piano and

Soon the piano asserts its
dominance in the -usual struggle

score is light at this point with rich,

There is quite a bit of dialogue
within the orchestra now changing‘
constantly from clarinet to piano to
viola to violins. Again the oboe
declares the‘ main theme in
recapitulation. After a brief climax
an exciting coda breaks in on a
poetic piano section.

The second movement, andante
in nature is led by the piano into

some tender passages recalling the ‘

theme of the first movement.
Lush, slow-moving string parts
alternate with the theme of the

Anton Bruckner’s Romantic
Symphony got off to a slow start in
the nineteenth century. Bruckner’s
Third Symphony was a dismal
failure and the Vienna Philhar-

After a rehearsal
Bruckner rushed up to the
conductor Hans Richter and gave

great success.

A picturesque horn solo sings’

over the tremelo of the strings as
the symphony opens. Brass and
strings build to ‘a point where they
soar and sail on the wings of a
majestic theme. An important

and recalled again and again.

Peaceful moods are alternated
with exciting moments where the
orchestra rushes to life. The brass

Panthers; rushing for 166 yards on 23 carries. The Sooners dominated
the Panthers and clearly showed why they are ranked number one in

the country.

Oklahoma Setback

No Cause for Alarm

BY JIM SPANOS

Though the 46-10 defeat that the
Oklahoma Sooners inflicted on the
Pitt Panthers certainly was dis-
heartening, it should not be viewed
with alarm. As Johnny Majors and
everybody else on both sides of the
Mississippi River knew prior to

Saturday, Oklahoma is the best

collegiate team in the nation, by
far. All the discussion about the
famed wishbone offense, Joe
Washington, the Selmons, Tinker
Owens and others, proved to be

well-founded.

It will be a shock of earthquake

A  proportions if Oklahoma loses a

game this year. Offensively, it was v

" as good as expected, but defen-

sively, wow! Tony Dorsett rushed
fora mere 17 yards on 12 carries,
and that tells the game story. That

 -Dorsett was inhibited so drastically
_ is not a measure of his ability, nor
 of the Panther’s offensive line, but
‘of the superiority of the Oklahoma

defense.
There is’ no substitute for
and no doubt the

70,000, 1400 miles from home and
against a great team is invaluable.
By comparison, when the Pan-

'7 ‘thers travel to Army, Temple, West
Virginia and Syracuse, the thought

  of playing, on the road will be

considerably less nerve-wracking.
In retrospect, it is clear that no

  V matter how badly Pitt could have

, lost the game, it would have meant

little. Losing by a score of 21-10 is
the same as losing 46-10, at least in
the loss column, and the setback
probably won’t damage the Pan-

‘ thers’ standing in the top twenty or

prospects for a post-season bowl
game.

The 1975 season is only just
beginning, and it still can be a very
good year. “I’m certainly not

the game. “I didn’t see anybody.
quitting out there today, and I hope
we cameout of the game with
some conﬁdence.”

In the next six games, against
William and Mary, Duke, Temple,
Army, Navy and Syracuse, Pitts-
burgh will be the favorite. The

William and Mary game on'

Saturday is a very important game. .
The time has come in the Majors
era when, to win certain games is
not enough. to win them impres-
sively is certainly more preferable;
it’s what-builds a team’s conﬁ-
dence. Sure, it will be easy for Pitt
to take the game too lightly, and
this is exactly what it doesn’t need.
There is too much at stake.

With the proper attitude, enthu-
siasm, hard work and a certain
amount of luck, there is good
reason to believe Pitt can enter the
West Virginia game with a 6-1
record. You cancall-it counting the

NORMAN, Oklahoma...Fear
not, football fanatics, the Okla-
homa Sooners DO have a weakness,
--their fourth-string ball boy is only
6-6, 270. Other than that they are
every superlative cliche that has
ever been said.

Saturday before a sellout crowd,
a very good Pitt team met a
fantastic, awesome, etc. Sooner
team and the score told the story as
the Big Red won, 46-10.

“I’ve never seen a better team in

«the eight years I’ve been a head
coach,” Johnny Majors said.
“They not only have quality
personnel at every position but
they have quantity at all spots
also.”

Pitt won the opening toss--
always a seemingly good sign--and
elected to receive. Tony Dorsett
took the boot and made it back to
the 14. Unfortunately that was
about as far as the Panthers got on
the series and they were forced to
punt. .

On the Sooners’ first contact wit
the ball, quarterback Steve Davis,
who probably belongs to the

In college football

Magicians of America because of
his deft ball handling, came out
throwing and kept the ball away
from “Slippery” Joe Washington,
the Sooners’ Heisman Trophy
candidate.

Pitt’s second possession reveal-
ed a small weakness in the Sooner
defense. On a third and ﬁve pass,
quarterback Robert Haygood threw
a bomb to split end Karl Farmer to
the 0U 30 and the Cats were
moving.

Just three plays later, via a bad
handoff, the Sooners got the ball
back on their own 19. ’

From there the Sooner offensive
machine began to churn out the
yardage for which it is so widely,
known. In 12 plays the ball moved
entirely on the ground to the Pitt
seven. I

And from there it was all up to
sophomore Elvis Peacock to scam- A

beautiful pitch from a falling Davis.

The point after was‘ good and
Oklaliomaled, 7-0, with 3:47 left in ‘
the first quarter-

After Tony DiRienzo’s boot out
of the end zone, the Panthers'were
aided by two major penalties
against the Sooners, getting first
and 10 at the 0U 49.

With 10 seconds left in the
stanza, Haygood threw a quick
pass over the middle to tight end
Jim Corbett for 14 and the ﬁrst
down.

Four plays later the toe--Carson
Long--came in _to try a 45-yard ﬁeld

oal.

The ball had plenty of range but
was just wide left, so the score
remaineii seven-zip. '

Once again the turf eaters came

on and eight plays later the Sooners
were on the Panther 15 with a ﬁrst
and ten.

It was during this series that
some Oklahomans nearly suffered
coronary arrest. Pushed out of
bounds by Pitt’s James Farley
following a seven-yard gain,
“Jukin” Joe slid off the ﬁeld and
ended up with his head hitting the
players’ bench. Immediately every
doctor in the state was on hand to
administer ﬁrst aid to the Sooner
States greatest resource.

Rather than sputter, OU kept on
moving, with Davis masterfully
mixing halfback plunges with end
sweeps. _

Suddenly number 24 reappeared
unscathed as the Sooner band
played “Boomer Sooner” and the
redshirts cheered. -

Following a perfect Peacock
block, Washington scampered the
remaining 15 yards and OU led,
13-0. DiRienzo’s kick was good and
the Sooners led, 14-0, with 11:57
left in the half.

Again Pitt made little progress
against the immovable Sooner
defense, giving the ball back at the
9:34 mark. “

This time Davis tryed something
new--he passed the ball. Tinker
Qwens,_known to Sooner fans as
“Old Glue Fingers” because he’s .
dropped just one pass in three
years, took a third and 13 pass from
the Pitt 36 down to the Panther 10
and things looked gray again.

Washington danced and pranced,
the ﬁnal 30 feet, the PAT was good
and the machine led, 20-0.

The Panthers began to move the
ball on their next series, with

In a similar situation last year,
Southern California drained the
Panthers of everything it had.
Then North Carolina ambushed the
weary Cats on the next week. That
North Carolina loss, more than
anything else, cost the Panthers a
bowl bid, and for that reason you
can be sure the coaches will

William and Mary contest.

Ali Interrupts Frazier  

MANILA AP--Dressed in black
and shouting insults, heavyweight
champion Muhammad Ali emerged
from the shadows near the ceiling
of the Folk Arts Theater training
site Sunday in an attempt to
interrupt challenger Joe Frazier’s
workout.

Frazier appeared more amused
than upset when he stretched out
on the floor for sit-ups and spotted
All almost directly above him on a
catwalk. _

Frazier laughed and ended his

'1 gym session as All screamed
. taunts, waved his ‘arms and led
_p spectators in chanting, ‘-‘Ali, Ali,

 

Ali..." Ali had no microphone, and
most of what he shouted was lost to
posterity. _

A smiling Frazier took a ring
mike to punctuate Ali's spiel.

“I hope you are ready to go,
slick...ls everything all right?
Don’t exert yourself now. Take it
easy...don’t get excited. it’s kind
of hot and I don't want you to have
a heart attack before the fight.”

Frazier likened Ali to a chicken
roosting in the roof before strolling
to his room.

“When a chicken goes to roost, it
means he’s tired. He's justlike a
chicken up in the roof, roosting, my

man." . . J ,

this weekend was no exception.

The number-two ranked Ohio’

State Buckeyes defeated number-
eight Penn State before a sellout
crowd in Columbus by a 17-9
margin. The Nittany Lions, who
were designated 16-point under-
dogs before the game, had early

‘difficulty in stopping the Ohio State

Offense. On its ﬁrst possession of

» the day, the Buckeyes rambled 80

yards in eight plays, with fullback
Pete. Johnson plowing over from
the one-yard lane for the score.
Then the Penn State defense
settled down, and the game rapidly
turned into a defensive struggle.
Penn State never crossed the goal
line; the only points it could
‘manage came from the toe of Chris
Bahr, who booted field goals in the
ﬁrst, second and third quarter.
Archie Griffin scampered for 128
yards for the afternoon, and
teammate Johnson added an
additional 112 yards. For Penn
State, fullback Duane Taylor picked
up 113 yards on 16 carries, leading
the Lion attack.

Ohio State, shut out during the"

second and third quarter, scored
the game-winning touchdown late
in the fourth quarter on an 11-yard
Johnson_ run. 0

Ohio State’s Big Ten counterpart
ranked third in the
nation, found Paciﬁc Eight Power-
house Stanford too much to handle,
as the Cardinals fought Michigan
to a 19-19 standstill. Stanford
ﬁeld-goal kicker Mike Langford
booted a 33-yard field goal with just
nine seconds remaining on the
clock.. Michigan, playing in its
home stadium, had taken a 7-6
halftime lead on a 48-yard
touchdown pass‘ from Leach to Jim
Smith. The Wolverines added _two

~. _third-quarterﬁeldgoals, and led-at 7

that point 13-6. But Stanford
scored a touchdown and a ﬁeld goal
in the fourth quarter, setting up
Langford’s heroics.

THE WEEK BEFORE, PENN
STATE’ HAD BEATEN THE
CARDINALS, 34-24, IN STATE
COLLEGE.* ’

In yet another surprising-
game, the Auburn War Eagles’
were tied by the Baylor Golden
Bears, 10-10.‘ Auburn, who was
supposed to mount a still challenge

Conference this year, has yet to win

Auburn had taken a commanding.

44-yard punt return but was held
scoreless the rest of the game.
Baylor tied the game in the third
‘quarter 'on a two—yard pass from
quarterback Charlie Parker to
tight-end Ron Lee.

Twelfth-ranked Florida found the
seond game of the season as
horrendous as Penn State, Michi-
gan and Auburn, by losing to North
Carolina State, 8-7. Things looked
promising for Florida in the first
quarter when it scored its first
touchdown on a 17-yard run by
Larry Brinson. North Carolina-
State, who had been shut_ out for
three quarters, finally discovered
paydirt late in the fourth quarter
when Elijah Marshall caught a
38-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Dave Buckey. The
Wolfpack got the two-point conver-
sion when fullback Johnny Evans
blasted through the Florida de-
fense. North Carolina State, who
lost to Wake Forest last week,
upped its record to 2-1, while
Florida dropped to 1-1.

_ West_Virginia proved that its
impressive victory over Temple last
week was no fluke, as it pounded
the slightly favored University of

time, 17-0. Notre Dame, ranked
ninth, has yielded only three points
all year, and that should give some
indication of where the Irish
strength lies. Offensively, the Irish
could manage just a 29-yard -ﬁeld
goal in the first quarter to make the
score 3-0 after three quarters.
Then, safety Luther Bradley
intercepted a pass by Purdue
quarterback Scott Dierking and
returned the ball 99 yards for the
ﬁrst touchdown of the game.

Luther ﬁgured he’d do his bit
again. Moments after his ﬁrst
interception, he picked off another.
The Irish drove for their second
touchdown and the game was
clearly out of reach. ‘

' Temple University is quickly
discovering what Eastern football
is all about, as it lost its third
consecutive game of the season.
This time it came at the hands of

Booter Offense Rolls
 As Panthers Win, 5-3

BY JIM LEWIS

You’ve heard the expression,
“Let sleeping dogs lie?”

It definitely does not apply to Pitt
Soccer coach Leo Bemis.

In preparation for last Saturday’s
soccer match between Pitt and
Point Park, Bemis ordered special
shooting practices to wake up the
“sleeping dog” offense Pitt dis-
played in<>its ﬁrst two matches--you
know, the same two matches in

e which the Pitt offense didn’t score
/"a goal.

Bemis even went as far as
hinting that there would be a few
“changes” made in Saturday’s
game. .

Well, there certainly were.

The offense woke-up, and it was
Point Park’s defense that was
ﬂea-bitten, as Pitt’s ominous
offensive display . defeated the
perilous Point Park Pioneers, S-3.

Don’t let the narrow two-goal
margin of victory fool you, though.

The score wasn’t close as it seemed. '

Pitt drew first blood early in the
game when Al Jutca scored his first
goal on ‘a penalty shot after he had
been knocked down by a Point Park
defenseman. Pitt took an early 1-0
lead. '

Pitt put pressure on the Point
Park goal from that point on, but it
was the Pioneers who scored next
on a lucky goal. A deﬂected pass
rolled out in front of the Pitt goal,
right to a Point Park forward who
kicked it past a fallen Frank ’Bucci.-
The score was tied, 1-1. I

But Pitt kept the pressure on--so
strongly, in fact, Point Park’s
defense suddenly rolled over and
played dead shortly after it had put
itself back in the game.

John .Morahan put Pitt 'out in
front to stay midway through the

At Cal St.

The Pitt Cross Country Team
opened the season Saturday with a
substantial victory at the California
State Invitational. Pitt avenged its
loss last year by rolling over the
competition. In a sport in which
low score wins, Pi_tt’s 20 points was
sufﬁcient to win over the two
closest opponents--West Virginia
with 78_ and last year’s champs,

S Indiana, with 86.

‘Senior Nick Martin . was the
individual winner, setting a new

course record of 25:20.7 for the 5.1 .

mile race. Martin also received the
Blanc Award for the outstanding
runner of the meet.

Head Coach Mike Agostinella,
commenting on his team’s perfor-
mance, said: “It was a nice start. It
gavethe freshmen and other team
members a chance to find
themselves in respect to the others
on the Pitt team.

“But the teams here are no way
comparable to the powers ot the
Midwest which Pitt will have to
contend-with next. We got the ball
rolling! I

V “The. team has a lot of maturing
to do,” Agostinella continued,
“but when you place eight runners
in the first 14, you must be doing
something well.”

Revenge is sweet!

first half when a Jutca pass found
him alone to the left of the Point
Park goal. He had no trouble
beating the surprised goalie cleanly
to put the Panthers in the lead 2-1.

Tom Murphy made it 3-1 at
halftime with a beautiful goal set
up by Morahan. Morahan kicked a
high pass from the left of the net to
Murphy, who was waiting in front.
Murphy then stung the ball into the
net with his head, leaving the Point
Park goalie and two other
defensemen helplessly frozen in
their tracks.

As the second half started, Pitt
once_ again took control of the game
with relentless pressure on the
opposition’s defense.

Despite the pressure, however,

A Point Park scored first early in the

second period on a nice pass in
front of the Pitt net to an onrushing
Pioneer forward. The Pitt lead was
whittledidown to 3-2.

Pitt got that goal just a few
minutes later, as John Curley’s
pass from the right of the Point
Park net found Murphy open in
front. It was Murphy’s second goal
of the game and Pittvtook what
looked like a commanding 4-2 lead.

But Point Park, though totally
outplayed, still wasn’t out of it.
This time it used its unique speed,
as a Pioneer forward zipped past
the Pitt defense to close the gap to
4-3.

Point Park, with visions of
comeback in its head, tried putting
all the pressure it could muster on
the Pitt defense. That didn’t last
too long, however, as with only one
minute left in the game and just a
few minutes after the Pioneer’s
goal, Jutca killed all chances of a
comeback with his second goal of
the game. He took a headman pass
and slipped by the drawn-up Point

sensation Gordon Jones to the 0U
34, where the Panthers gambled on
a fourth and one. _

Unfortunately the gamble didn’t
work. Dorsett was caught for a
three-yard loss and Oklahoma took
over on its own 37.

Churning out more yardage,
including another 16 yards in the
air, the Sooner offense set up the
final score of the half as DiRienzo
hit on a 37-yard ﬁeld goal. The half
ended: Ou 23, Pitt 0.

The third quarter was much like
the first. The Panthers played well
defensively although the only
offense was a 46-yard Long field
goal. One thing remained
steady--Washington was virtually
unstoppable. Whether it was
running back kicks just executing
plays from scrimmage, the senior
seemed constantly in the Panther
secondary.

The Sooners only touchdown of
the stanza was the result of a
Panther miscue. With a ﬁrst and
10 on the Panther 42, Haygood
dropped back to pass but was hit
blindly by defensive end Jimbo
Elrod and fumbled the ball. Elrod
recovered, (one of two for the day),
and the Sooners were once again at-
the door. ,

Three plays later Peacock ran the
final 19 for the TD. The point after
was good and the score was 0U 37,
Pitt 3.

At the 51-second mark, the
Panthers committed another costly
fumble and once more the Big Red
began to move, this time from the
Pitt 47. 1

Moving continually on the
ground, with the most exciting play
a Washington leapfrog over a Pitt
defender, the Sooners went in on a
one-yard plunge by “Slippery
Joe.”

. Two plays later, following still

, ano_ther Panther fumble, OU had

-terback Dean Blevins,

the ball at the Pitt 14. This time a
new character, second-string quar-
took the
honors, upping the score with the
PAT to 44-3.

The brightest spot of the whole
afternoon for the Panthers came on

- the next series when, on a third and

seven at the Pitt 46,‘ Haygood found
Farmer over the middle. Going to
the far-side sideline and pouring on
his world class sprinting speed to
elude two Red defenders, Farmer
gave the Panthers their first
touchdown of the day. Long added
the point and the score read 0U 44,
Pitt 10.

> The last score was an unimpor-
tant safety on a blocked Swider
punt, again emphasizing the
awesome Sooner rush.

Although the ﬁnal score seemed
so lopsided, Majors was realistic.

“l’ve come out of many
ballygames where the score was a
lot closer and didn’t feel as good as
I do after this one. OU has a

“Their personnel is excellent,”-

probably the best tackle in college - . 2

and Tinker Owens is trememdous.‘

BY TOM HALL.

Why might an all-star high
school football player choose Pitt
over the likes of North Carolina,
Iowa and Maryland? To ﬁnd the

I answer, you might ask Matt
Cavanaugh, who received offers
from all_ of the above institutions.

“Well, there were two reasons,”
Cavanaugh said. “Primarily, I
chose Pitt because this is what

 ’ ‘_ you’d-call the big-time of college
- football.” With an opponent no
less than Oklahoma staring him in‘
' the face, most would consider that
an understatement.
Af“The other reason was the
situation the Pitt football program
was in. They had two senior
quarterbacks (Bob Medwid and Bill
Daniels) and lﬁgured Pitt would be

a good opportunity for me to play.”

Cavanaugh overlooked one thing
however. He is primarily known as
a passing quarterback, and when
spring drills came around, Coach
Johnny Majors decided it was time
to launch what will be known in Pitt
football history as “the. age of the
veer.”

The veer, as everyone who
follows football knows, is a
designated running game, tailor-
made for a running quarterback.
Running with the football is not
Matt Cavanaugh’s forte. ‘ '

‘‘I knew I was at a disadvantage
with the veer offense, ‘but 1 unlike

‘ the wishbone, there is more of a

passing element involved.”

'And so the veer ‘marches on, and
on, and on. Is it a better offense
than the basic “I” formation, in the

eyes of a passer?

“I like the veer actually,”
Cavanaugh said. “I think we
showed that it can be run, and run
successfully, in the second half
against Georgia. We had a little
trouble getting on track in the first
‘half with the rain and the poor ﬁeld
position we usually had, but it did
work for us.” . . ‘ -'

So what does the future hold for
Matt Cavanaugh? . I l ‘

“I’d like to play, and I think I’ll
get a chance this year. Right now

lRobert Haygood is the starting

quarterback, and the best way I can
help is to give him any encourage-
ment he needs to help him get

I through the rough spots. He knows

what he’s doing; he’s reading the
defensive line better all the time.’

‘‘I knew he was the one I’d be
fighting for the starting job, and I
think he deserves to be where he is.

It’s quite a transition from the
junior varsity team to the varsity
team. l’ve had to learn a lot, and
I’m learning a lot now. Robert has
had varsity experience, and now
he’s building the confidence he
needs to go out and get the job
done. I'll just have to wait. for my
turn to come up and show what I
can do.”

But when will that time arise?
George Haffner, the quarterback
coach of the Pitt Panthers,. shed
some light on the matter.

“Matt Cavanaugh is a_ remark-
able individual, both as a football
player and as.a human. being.
When the time and situation are
right, Matt is going to play. I He is a
deﬁnite asset «to the team, and an

outstanding quarterback. H_e’s got ‘

the character and dedication I look

' for in a footbal player. -He is a

winning football player. He is

, getting a lot of work in practice and
VI know he'll get a chance to play -

real soon. V — -

He knows he’s gotta be ready for
whenever we need him.‘ He’s a
hard worker, and I think when the

time comes, he’ll be'“ready. "we ’

could well go to a two-quarterback
system. this I, year, and that’s
something to think about.” r I ~

It would not be too sarcastic to
say “stay in there pitching, Matt,”
because his timeeis gonna come.

  ‘ Offense Awakeins For

Pitt Soccer Team

(Continued from Page 13)
Despite the close score, the
game was extremely lopsided in
Pitt's favor.

Looking at the game from an_

offensive standpoint, it could easily

. be said that Pitt’s offense attacked
like a K-9 police dog, while Point

Park’s offense resembled Huckle-
berry Hound. _ .

Looking at the game from’ a
defensive standpoint, Pitt held the
unusually quick and agile West

African offense of Point Park to,

only three goals while the Pioneer’s
defense looked like it was sitting up
and begging for a better fate than

the barrage of’ Pitt goals it was
getting.

A good crowd of wet,‘ loyal fans

NORMAN, Oklahoma--After
watching the Pitt-Oklahoma foot-
ba.. game in person, I thought
about everything written and said
about the Sooner team: awesome,
tremendous, fantastic. And
without a doubt all that was said
was true many times over.
Oklahoma is the number-one team
in the nation and rightly so.

Domination was the name of the
game in Norman and the Sooners
showed why they aren’t bothered
by any team that shows up to play."
Pitt went into the game with one of

‘.'m}‘iie fastest backfields in the nation
,_ in Tony Dorsett, Elliott Walker and
-Robert Haygood, a group that was
called “three Greg Pruitts in one
backfield” by OU Head Coach
Barry Switzer.

If the Sooner defense was in awe,
it didn’t show it once the entire
afternoon. Many times you hear of
the pursuit of a defense, or how it
follows the ball. Oklahoma has
excellent pursuit. In the Selmon

' brothers, Leroy and Dewey, OU
could have the toughest interior
line in the country. Dewey ended
the afternoon with one solo and five
assisted tackles for the day, while
big twin Leroy had seven unas-

_._,,/"”,_;i_sted and one assist. ’

Don’t look now, but it’s hockey
time again.

2 ,..., A total of 30 veterans and rookies
,4’. -“took up Pittsburgh Penguin train-
ing camp last Monday in hopes of
improving on last year’s record-set-

.__‘ _ing performance." ‘

" The thigh-flying Penguins wel-
come back a ﬂock of goal-scoring
forwards, including 30-plus goal-
men Vic Hadﬁeld, Rick Kehoe and
Pierre LaRouche, along with Jean
Pronovost, who led the team with
43 lamplighters. 4

In fact, all nine forwards reached
the coveted I20-goal mark.

The Pens put 326 pucks into the
opposing net, ninth highest in
National Hockey League History.

The defense, seemingly a weak
,_»/..»..._point last year, returns with all the

‘regulars, including all-star Dave
Burrows and a young blue-line
corps.

Also buoying the defense is the
return of ‘ Steve Durbano, the
promising youngster who sat out all
last year with a broken wrist.

The goal will be guarded
adequately by Gary lnness, who
improved rapidly at the end of last
season and through the playoffs,
and Michel Plasse, the ex-Montreal
Canadien obtained from Kansas
City at midseason.

Pushing these returnees will be a
flock of rookies led by forward
Jacques Cossette, second-round
draft pick a year ago behind super
rookie LaRouche.

Joining him will be defenseman

“’ ‘action last season, and this year’s

number-one pick, Gordon Laxton, a
goaltender.

Gone from last year, though, is
an entire set of owners. It seems as
if financial troubles have left with
them.

“The new owners are committed
for a long time,” ‘says Public
Relations Director Terry Schiff-
hauer. ,“They were pleased with
fan reaction .last season and that’s ‘
why they got involved.”

The first job of the new owners,

the field for 60 minutes, was
defensive end Jimbo Elrod.
Number 54 ﬁnished with five solo
and five assisted tackles plus two
fumble recoveries (including one
he caused) and a pass break-up.

How much can be said about Joe
Washington? He is all that the
writers say about him and much
more. Whether running -up the
middle or around the end as the
wishbone dictates, Washington
could not be stopped by anything
less than a .38.

Even with Washington out of the
game, the quality diminishes little
when the likes of Elvis Peacock‘,
Horace Ivory or Jim Littrell are
available. These four rushed for a
total of 307 of the total 378 for the
Sooners. ..

The OU offensive line ﬁres out
and controls the defense to an
excellent degree. The wishbone
demands an excellent front, and
with people like “Battleship”
Vaughn and Terry Webb to run

behind, backs don’t need much,

time to break clear.

Head Coach Johnny Majors
speaks highly of the kicking game
and its importance and in Tony
DiRienzo the Sooners have a very
steady performer. Even if he
didn’t kick the ball out of the end
zone, it was deep enough to put the
Panthers in the hole from the start.

Perhaps the only weakness on
the Sooners’ team was punting.
With four punts, their average was
a measly 29 yards, compared to
Pitt’s 40.8. After you think of it,
the reason for such a poor showing
becomes evident--the Sooners have
no use for a good punter because,
with their offensive strength, they
never punt the ball. '

“OU has a great recruiting
program, they have great coaching
plus unlimited ﬁnances,” Majors
said. “Pitt once had the kind of
tradition the Sooners are famous
