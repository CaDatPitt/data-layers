meet until the latter part of April,
the work to be done on the technical
side of the convention, the actual re-
writing of the constitution, will take
time and research on the part of the
delegates.

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, head of the
department of political science, when
c0.m1ncnting_.on the probable faculty
co-operation with the student dele-
ga.tion’s work on the revising of the
constitution stated, “The danger the
Pitt students may run into on the
technical side of the convention is
of waiting until the last minute to
put Ill any work on the actual con-

hazard document a.nd make fools of
themselves at Harrisburg. It is the
desire of my department and of the
economic department to lead student
discussions on the present constitu-
tion and its weak points, but not to
‘rewrite’ the constitution for them.”
The actual convention will be carried
on by students and no advisers will
be permitted to sit on committees

so that a completely student written
and devised constitution will be as-
sured. ’l‘o further this end, all schools
sending delegates have been advised
to prepare their work completely in
their local seminars. No faculty 1uem—
bers will participate in the discussions
at Harrisburg. In all matters put to
vote in the convention committees
each school will have one vote, and
in the general meeting, according to
the number of delegates.

Two
:meetin.g, both of which were continu-
iations of Drevious council arguments.
i'l‘he ﬁrst, concerning the latest action
iof student relations committee, cen-
itered about the forced resignation of
{Edward McBride. -34, from the social
1 ciiairn1a"if§hi1i" of the Co‘.lege‘a’s‘socia-
‘ tion.

According to Ray McCune. E34,
chairman of the relations body, the
College association had failed to reg-
ister any of its three Grotto dances
with the con1'mitt.ee. “Although we
had repeatedly asked for cooperation
5 from Mr. Grove. president of the asso-

l
l

matter. As a last resort, we informed:
the group that they must either re-
move their social chairman or cancel’
their April formal dance.”

! “That action of student relations,”

{said l\lcParland, “was one of the best.

;t.hings they have done this year. The
tremoval of the responsible man, rath-
ier than the penalization of the entire
[student body, was the right thing to
' do.”

McCune's report did not go unchal-
llenged. James Danahey, C34, protest-
Eed against “the inﬂuence of the dean
‘of women's ofiice over the actions of
',student relations.” “The relations
movement again the Junior prom,” he
asserted, “was activated not by right-
eousness but by a personal quarrel. I
dare say there was the same situation
in regard to the College association."

After Danahey had criticized the
committee for having no standing on
the campus, “with so little attention
paid it that no one ever asks for its
authority.” McCune invited him to
next Monday's meeting of the body
“to help revise the rules.”

Once more the Pitt News “took it
on the chin” from McParland. “We
cannot count on ethics from the
News,” he said, “after the article in
Tuesday's issue.” The article in ques-
tion summarized the work of the new
government committee, but ga\'e T10
inkling of the type of activity being
planned.

“The editor of the News,” the pres-
ident claimt-’-d. “had no authority to
print that story. He broke his prom-
ise to the committee regarding pub-
licity. I should like to reassure you
that Student council, no matter what
the committee reports, will not be
abolished.”

EVERAL PITT UNDERGRADUATES have recently
announced their candidacies for political oflice in the

approaching primaries. These lads

names to a bewildered electorate this spring and will

compete with experienced, hardened
job.

The interest in governmental and political affairs which
our fellow students display is heartening in that it is an

indication that the entire temper of

governmental affairs has changed. College students are
in step with the citizens of the nation in the awakening
of public interest in national and international political

problems.

VVhether or not the voters in this district will care to
elect one of our fellow students is problematical.
is the election of these men really important.
portant question which arises is whether or not these
men intend to follow the political footsteps of the men
who have held political office in the past.

The days of “playing politics” merel
bition are past.

The public servant henceforth will be
measured by his service to his people, to the society
which elected him. Society will demand a lot more from

Army Sends Wittan.

To Fly Southern
2 AiriMai-l Route

By Charles B. Holstein

If George Havlak, chairman.- of the
coming Military Ball, is a respector
of tradition, he should make arrange-
ments to enter the United States
Army air service in Texas.

For the chairmen or the past two
Military Balls (including last year’s,
which never took place) are _“ﬂying
to town”) as the saying has it, in that
brancli of government service.

Eddie Wittan, C32, cha_irman of the
affair two years ago, is today. 3S
Lieut. Edgar M. VVittan, flying the

 

regular airmail route between Louis-
ville, Kentucky, and Memphis, Tennes-

see, and has been doing so since the
Army took over the routes from pri-
vate companies last month. And
George Hatcher, C33, who, although
chairniau of the Ball last year, never
did get to lead any grand march, was,
on Saturday. transferred from the
Army preliminary ﬂying school at
Randolph ﬁeld, Texas, to the advanc-

ed school at Kelly ﬁeld in the same
state. He recently had the signal
honor of being chosen to complete his ,
training in pursuit ﬂying, a type 0f
schooling which goes only to the out-
standing members of the cadet class.

Both men are well known among
upperclassmen at the University-
V\"ittan, whose home is in P01‘tage.
was a member of Phi Epsilon Pi fra-
ternity; Hatcher, a Pittsburgher, be-
longed to Phi Delta Theta.

VI/ittan, until his assignment to
mail duty, had been stationed at
Langley ﬁeld, Virginia, after his com-
pletion of training in Texas. He fre-
quently made ﬂights to Portage and
to Pittsburgh from the Virginia ﬁeld,
and flew here in the fall to see the
Pitt-Duquesne football game.

While in school, X-Vittan was noted
for an inherent love of sleeping. C91‘-
tuin of his fraternity brothers al-
leged that he always ran home from
classes so that he could begin his
nap earlier. As for Hatcher, it is
doubtful if he will ever forget or live
down that memorable period of last
year, one day before the Kalmends of
April (or March 31, if you refuse to
be classical) when the “Biggest and
39st Dance of the Year” never took
place——rigl1t after George and his
“Queen” had been widely photo-
graphed as grand march leaders.

I Twenty Years Ago Today

From the Files of the Pitt Weekly:

“Starting at the sound of the gong,
a band of earnest young men and
young women yesterday launched the
movement to secure the name of every
Pitt student upon a manimoth petition
to grant no liquor licenses in the
Oakland district.”

 

“A new oiqranization of great value
which has assisted in recent student
meetings, is the student orchestra.

“The orchestra is composed of Wil-
liam T. Canon, piano; H, G. W’. Smith,
violin;  Love, Cornet; R. S. Ten-
nant, bass violin, and Joe Replogle,
cello.”

 

“On next Monday night the Univer-
sity will hold the ﬁrst wrestling meet
in the history of the institution. An
orchestra and a quartet will furnish
the music for the occasion. Athletic
books will be good at this event and

the students are urged to be present.”

The title Meda will be conferred
upon freshman and upperclass wo-
men this Tuesday in compliance with
the new requirements granting the
t.itle, drawn up by Miss Thyrsa Amos,
dean of women, and the three con- ,
venors of the group, Merle Metzgel‘.
C34, Mary G. Herroli, Ed35, and Car-
olyn Hall, C36.

The title Meda, Shawnee Indian for
"wise man,” was first used six years
ago by Miss Amos, to designate wo-
men who had attained high scholar-E
ship in their freshman year. The ﬁrst ;
group so honored decided to carry!
over their titles into their sophomore, ;
junior and senior years.

Hereafter it has been decided the
title of Meda shall be given an11ual--
ly, in February, to all women who
have maintained the high scholastic
average necessary during the previous
year, This new qualiﬁcation not only
gives upperclass women, who were
unable to make high enough grades
in their freshman year, an opportunity
to become members of the organiza-
iion; but it also makes it necessary
that old members maintaining their
scholastic record every year to con-
'..inue to be known as Medas.

Raising the minimum scholastic
standard to a new high average of
2.5 and designating three degrees of
scllolarsliip by the titles, Meda, cum
laude, Meda, magna cum laude, and‘
Meda, suinina cum laude, the new,
Meda group will approximate the‘;
standards of Phi Beta Kappa.

Pitt Interscholastic Swimming
Pool Tomorrow

Meet At Trees

 

Varsity Team In
Championships

 

Tomorrow afternoon at 1 o’clock in
Trees pool the twentieth annual Inter-

scholastic swimming meet sponsored
by the University will get under way.
Some of the
b e s t p r e p
school swim-
ming teams in
this section of
the c o u n t r y
will compete
for the team
trophy spon-
sored by the 
University. Pat ‘
Corr, varsity
swimming
coach, and di-
rector of the
meet, believes
t h a t tomor-
row's a f f a i r
will even sur-
pass the high-
ly successful
meet of last _year. Corr, making his
prediction from the list of entries, be-
lieves that a few of the present scho-Al
lastic pool records will fall. 

Some of the strongest teams ini
\Vestern Pennsylvania, Vvest Virginia,
and Ohio are bringing large squads to ,
Pittsburgh for the meet. McKinley;
high school of Canton, winner of the‘
meet last year will be on hand with]
a strong team trying to retain the
championship. Erie Strong Vincent,
1932 champions have entered a well-
balanced team which may swim off
with another ﬁrst place.

Other contenders in the meet in-
cludes swimmers from Taylor Allder-
dice, Turtle Creek, Schenley, South,
Langley, W'arwood, Wheeling, Tria-
delphia, Erie Tech, Erie East, Mun-
hall, Duquesne, and Oakmont.

The trial heats will take place in
the afternoon, starting at 1 o’clock.
The evening program, which will
start at 8 o'clock promises to be even
more entertaining than the afternoon
program. Besides swimming off the
scholastic ﬁnals, the Pitt champion-
ships will take place.

There is plenty of competition be-
tween members of the varsity team
for the individual championships.
Practically all of the swimmers en-3
tered in the short distance sprintsl
stand an even chance of winning.
The Pitt championships will take
place in conjunction with the scho-
lastic ﬁnals, starting at 8 o’clock.

Order of events for Saturday even-
ing:

Golf Coach Anticipates
Six Man Team This Year

Record made

Record

 

With a wealth of material at his
command, Regis Wolff, Varsity golf
coach, is expecting to be able to have
a six-man golf team this year instead
of the four-man squad which repre-
sented the University last season.
Although the squad will lose Art
Sekay, member of last year’s team,
who alternated with McKee at the
number one position, it will be
strengthened by the addition of Wolff,
who was ineligible for competition
last year.

Three of the fourteen candidates,
who reported to Wolff last week.
played on the Varsity last year. These
men are Claude McKee, Sammy Deck-
er and Albert Ferarro.

Five Pitt Boxers
Seek Conference

Individual Titlesl

Carmella, Gongloﬁ", Schricker, Kc- I

nick And. Gianatti Fight
For Championships

 

Five Panther boxers will compete

in the Eastern Intercollegiate boxing

conference championships which will
take place at VVest Virginia univer-
sity, Morgantown, West Virginia. The
semi-ﬁnals will take place tonight.
The *inners of the semi—ﬁnals will
meet Saturday evening to decide the
champions in each weight class.

The boxers competing in the cham-
pionship matches are selected from
past performances, and are supposedly

the best fighters in the various weight '

classes. The Mountaineers lead in
the number of candidates entered
with seven men, one in each weight
class. Five Pitt men were selected,
four Carnegie Tech, Duquesne, Tem-
ple, Bucknell, and VVashington and
Jefferson will be represented in three.
weight classes.

The five Pitt entries are: Charles
Carmella, 115 pounds; Abe Konick,

135 pounds; Jimmy Gianatti, 145
pounds; Captain Jack Schricker, 155
pounds; and Charles Gongloff, 175-

pound division.
It is quite doubtful that the Pan-
thers will win the team championship
trophy, for the team cannot come
near to matching the Mountaineers.
who have an exceptionally strong and
well balanced team in quest of the
title, however the Panthers do stand
a ﬁne chance of winning at least two
of the individual matches,
Captain Schricker, present confer-
ence 155-pound champ stands a good
chance to win the 155-pound title even
though he has already lost one de-
cision to Gallo, V\7est Virginia entry
in the 155—pound class. Jimmy Gia-
natti will be rather severely handi-
capped in as much as he is ﬁghting in
the 145—pound class, which is exactly
10 pounds above his normal weight.
Konick, Carmella, and Gongloff al-
though they have not shown much so
far this season may come through and
defeat their opponents.

Clothes Expert States
Americans Must I
Learn Styles

 

“American men are self-conscious
about their clothes,” says Major
Charles H. Tebay, W. C_, distinguished
,English stylist, and now stylist for
the Fintex Corporation.

in the opinion of Major Tebay, the
American male looks to the women
for color and freedom in dress, while
he neglects his own appearance. That
status, the major believes, is all wrong.
In his opinion the male of the species
should dress up externally as much
.as they zrepare their inward self be-
;fore embarking on a new venture,
lcareer or business deal.

 The major does know his clothes.
For the past two years he has been
quite active in Hollywood, an ac-,
knowiedged style center, where he;
was employed as technical director in}
the production, “Calvacade,” as welll
as many other successes. He also
had an important part in “Queen
Christina,” the current Garbo success.

Prior to his engagement in Holly-
wood, Major Tc-bay was actively con-
nected with the famous English tail-
oring houses both in London and New
York, a connection he established soon
after he retired from active service;
in the British army. 1

Since his retirement from the army
the major has been instrumental in
setting men’s wear styling throughout
America and Europe and it appears
as though his acquisition by the Fin-
tox company will mean a rebirth of
a more colorful American gentleman,
and the casting off of the age-old
fetish towards conservatism,

Resin, Gloves, a11d Glory?

One of the finest athletes in Pitt history will say farewell to a Panther

‘uniform tomorrow night when Jack Schricker hangs up the gloves after his

defense of his Conference 155-pound title at Morgantown.

The Carrick boy has been a. real credit to the collegiate boxing game in
this district, and to the University as well. Starting out as a freshman, with
absolutely no boxing knowledge whatsoever, the present boxing captain ap-

plied himself studiously to an analysis of the game, and the results have

been quite pleasing to everyone who has had the pleasure of his friendship.
The fact that he was rated the outstanding prospect in the district ‘while still
a freshman, has not turned Schricker’s head. Any Pitt student interested in
boxing could always be sure of help and advice.

Probably the greatest tribute that could be offered this boy is the
fact that his teammates as well as his opponents regard him highly.
Just as no man is a hero to his valet, so is no man a hero to his
teammates unless he has proven himself so in their minds. Needless
to say, Schricker has more than enough of “what it takes,” and every
member of the Pitt squad, as well as every man he has fought will
vouch for that. No more could he asked of any man.

It seems a shame that the Panthers will be without his services for the
next boxing season. There isn’t a raw freshman or varsity man on the Pitt

,-squad that would not like to see Carrick, in the person of Jack Schricker,
§represented in Pitt boxing next year, in some capacity.
ldone to give additional recognition to thelman who has DONE ;\l()P.T£ THAN
{ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL TO POPULARIZE BOXING AT Pll"l‘, Captain
:Jack Schricker.

NO two people in the world look
alike . . . act alike. So it is with
tobacco . . . just like folks.

No two leaves are the same.

And it’s the same with cigarettes . . .
no two brands are alike.
Furthermore, not only are the to-
baccos different, but the Way the to-
baccos are handled is different.

This, you can understand.

You know just as Well as we do
that no two manufacturers use the
same kinds of tobaccos, or blend them
or cross-blend them or weld them
together in the same manner.

We do everything that science
knows and that money can buy to
make CHESTERFIELD as good a
cigarette as can be made.

We hope you like them. They are
"not like others.”
