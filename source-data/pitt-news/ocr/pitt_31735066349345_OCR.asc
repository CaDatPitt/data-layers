“Gronsky Appeal Hearing

To Ruleon SG Election

c BY BILL MOORE

Whether a second Student
Government Board presidential
election will be held tomorrow will
be decided today at a hearing
before the Student Government
Judicial Board (SGJB).

The SGJB will meet in Student
,/,.?Union Dining Room A at 3 p.m. to
1" //hear presidential candidate Joe

Gronsky’s appeal of last week’s
Student Government Election Com-
mittee (SGEC) ruling invalidating
the previous election and schedul-
ing ‘ voting again tomorrow.

[Editor’s note: For interviews
with the four presidential candi-
dates, see story below.]

_ Gronsky will argue that no
evidence was presented at the
SGEC hearing to prove anyone
tried to vote for Barry Weisband,
but couldn’t. Weisband, who ﬁled
the successful appeal to have the

second-‘place vote-getter in that
election. ‘

"His appeal concerned pieces of
paper on the voting machines that
slipped and covered his name.‘

“Not one witness said they had
tried to vote for Barry, but couldn’t
ﬁnd his name,” Gronsky said.
“And no witness said they had
talked with anyone who tried, but
couldn’t ﬁnd his name.”

He also opposes thenew election
because many students won’t be on-
campus Tuesday, and won’t be
able to vote. “A one-day election
won’t solve anything,” he claimed

- last night.

Gronsky won the original presi-
dential election by 32 votes. .

“‘I am not just appealing this
because it is the only thing I can
do,” Gronsky explained. “I
honestly don’t feel there was
enough evidence given to justify

holding a second election.”

Congress has _the power to
decide what information legitimat-
ely may‘ be withheld from the
public in the interest of national
security, but is afraid to use that
power, according to an American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
lawyer. '

John Shattuck, the coordinator of
all ACLU suits against the CIA,

discussed the recent House Intelli- '

gence Committee report before
speaking at the annual member-
ship meeting of the Pittsburgh
ACLU in the new Law School

_building last Friday.

The House committee, chaired
by‘ Otis Pike, D-N.Y., was
overruled last week when the
House as a whole voted to forbid
publication of the committee’s
report on U.S. intelligence agen-
cies until the President has deleted
information he feels is detrimental
to national security.

“The House lost faith in Pike,”
Shattuck said. “The CIA is using

“Everybody used to point ﬁngers at Kissinger or Nixon when the ‘
wiretaps were disclosed and say, ‘They did it,’ ” ACLU lawyer John

Shattuck said.

Should Pitt faculty be unionized,
and what role. should Student
Government play?

“It depends on theoutlook of the
union. You have to analyze them
before you decide. The SGB should
look at all the unions involved, and

_either support the union they think

would be most beneﬁcial, or
support unionization in general.”

Should students pay for football
tickets?

“No. We’ve been supporting
the football team for years. They
don’t need the money, they don’t
know what they want to do with the
money, so they shouldn’t tax" us.”.

What can the SGB do if the Ticket
Distribution Committee recom-
mends payment?

“If it comes down to it, we can
rally in front of the Cathedral, or
the Chancellor’s office.”

Can you see any circumstances
under which you would support a
tuition hike?

“As the situation is now, the
student body should not support a
hike unless we know why they need
the money. We can't make an
intelligent decision whether or not
to. support until we see the
budget.”

What tactics would you advocate
for battling a tuition bike you
deemed unjust? -
“You ‘have‘to use the student
member on the Board of Trustees
‘and on the State ‘Budget Policies
Committee. If that doesn’t work,
students and faculty"‘s'hould ‘band
together and ﬁght it with ‘demon-
strations——possibly a strike. ”

Would you consider raising the

JOE GRONSKY

Should Pitt faculty be unionized,
and what role should Student
Government play?

“I think thereal point is to get
students in there on the decisions.
There are many pros and cons to
unionization, but the main point is
getting the students at the
bargaining table. We should also
talk with the unions involved and
see which one has the most to offer
students.”

Should students pay for football,

tickets?

‘‘If the students accept a pay
system, I will. If they don’t, I
won’t. If the students say they
don’t want to pay for tickets,
Student Government should ﬁght
so they don’t.” .

What can the SGB do if th
Ticket Distribution Committee rec-
ommends payment?

“Whatever we have to do to ﬁght
it, if that is what the students
want."

Can you see any circumstances
under which you would support a
tuition hike?

“No. I don’t think any good
reason has been proposed.”

What tactics would you advocate
for battling in tuition bike you
deemed uniust?

“I would use student power, but
direct it here against the adminis-
tration. START-UP‘was good, but it
was aimed at the wrong people.
You have to let the administration
know students are opposed. If we
have to, possibly we could hold
some sort of rally.”

Would you consider raising the
activities fee?

“It's not that we need a bigger
activities fee; we need-to watch

« closer where the money goes. W5:

need a tighter control on the money
we "now have."

MARK SATINOF F

Should Pitt faculty be unionized,
and what role should Student
Government play?

“Yes. I don’t think students will,
for legal and other reasons, be able
to sit in on negotiations. Aside from
that, the SGB should be involved as
much as possible. And the unions
want that, or at least some of them
do.” I

Should students pay for football
tickets?

“No.”

What can the SGB do if the
Ticket Distribution Committee rec-
ommends payment?

“I would organize students,
either independently or through
organizations, in activities such as
the type used by the Graduate
Union. It 'wouldn’t be hard to get
students behind it, if they really
don’t want to pay.”

Can you see any circumstances
under which you would support a
tuition hike?

“No. I think tuition should be
lowered, and ultimately, higher
education should be free. In fact, I
believe students should be payed a
stipend. Poorer high school stu-
dents can't attend college because
they have to get jobs to support
themselves and their families.”

What tactics would you advocate
for battling a tuition bike you
deemed uniust?

“We all oppose tuition hikes.
The difference is how we go about
it. Change can only be achieved

through the masses of students on —

campus. Whether we use teach-
ins, sit-ins, rallies, or whatever,
depends on the speciﬁc situation."

Would you consider raising the
activities fee? '

“It’s true the $300,000. some-
times d_oesn’t seem like enough,
but students are taxed enough as it
is. No. not without a referendum.”

his committee."

Shattuck insisted the value of
investigations such as those under-
taken by the Pike committee lies
“not in the naming of names, but
in the establishment of the same
three objectives the ACLU is trying
to bring about."

The ACLU, in ﬁve separate
lawsuits headed by Shattuck
against the CIA, wants to establish
the principle that certain kinds of
intelligence operations are illegal,
Shattuck said.

The lawsuits may accomplish the
disclosure of the nature and extent
of those intelligence abuses,
Shattuck insisted, aswell as make
the persons involved accountable.

“The ACLU hasn’t yet filed suit

soon under the Freedom of

Speaking before a large crowd in

the ACLU “has sued everybody,
except the CIA, which until last
year had been shrouded in
secrecy." He said the continued
use of law enforcement agencies as
forms of social and political
repression forced the ACLU’s
hand:

“We had not even been allowed
to contemplate such kinds of things
before Watergate; we were just
cries in the wilderness,” Shattuck

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Time toV0te . . . Again

Tornorrow’s election will mark the second time within ‘two weeks that
Pitt students go to the polls to vote for a Student Government Board

(SGB) president. '

From the moment the Student Government Election Committee
ruled in favor of the appeal ﬁled by candidate Barry Weisband, thus
prescribing a new election, a lethargic electorate had little about which

to cheer.

VV1th the winner of the ﬁrst election, Joe Gronsky, contesting the
results of Weisband’s appeal, the Student Government Judicial Board
could very well decide this evening to cancel the second election and
allow the tallies of the ﬁrst one to stand.

At any rate, students should be prepared to vote once again

tomorrow.

A second disappointing turnout could spell defeat for the new Board
and its president, even before their ﬁrst meeting.‘

An SGB president deserves/more of a mandate than ﬁve percent of
the student body\—not just for his own peace of mind, but, more

importantly, for a show of support he can carry with him into the ofﬁce

of every administrator with ‘whom he will deal in the coming year.
Since the new Board has been safely elected, student voters will
have more time to study the proﬁles of the prospective presidents the

night before the election.

The little time it" takes to review a.candidate’s qualiﬁcations, or at
least to vote for the same candidate aga.in,.will save the new  a year
that it would otherwise need for re-establishing its credibility in the

7 face of the administration.»

F riends, All of alSudden

BY DAN MULHOLLAND _

During the past few weeks, we
have been subjected to numerous
eulogies occasionedlby the passing
of a famous personality. This
individual has been hailed as one of
the most important ﬁgures of the
twentieth century, as a farsighted
statesman, and as a leader of
unimpeachable integrity. One
nationally syndicated columnist
even went so far as to berate the
United Statesfor not following his
lead in the area of foreign policy.

The man is, of course, the late

premier of China, Chou En lai. But
an objective look at the record will
reveal that the current praises are

not only misdirected, but grossly
-unwarranted as well. -

Chou and his eminent associate
Mao Tse-tung were responsible for

the most savage and widespread

atrocities ever seen in the course of

_ human history. A report from the

House Judiciary Committee in 1971
deinonstrathed the scope of the
barbarity when it conﬁrmed that 64
million people had been executed
by. the Chinese Communists during
their long reign of terror.- This is
almost eleven times the number
put to death in the Nazi
concentration camps! This ﬁgure

; Letter.

i  Shutoff:

I am somewhat puzzled by the

~ letter on .“gas vshutoffs” in The Pitt

News signed (anonymously)

“Third World People's Coalition,
Political Action Society,» Black
Action Society," and I wonder if
anyone will be able to clear up my

“ v » difficulties with it. _
. . As I understand the letter. the
_ views it advocates can be general-

ized as follows to bring out their

r full implications: (1) If any person

A (or group of persons) has a need
for something. and if any other
person B (or group of persons) has
got what it takes to satisfy A’s
need, then B must (morally
speaking) satisfy A's need (e.g. let
A = “old \\‘om:m" and B =
“Equitable Gas Company").

Furtl1ct'morc. (2) It I! does not
want to, or otherwise doesn't.
satisfy A's need. then A has the
moral right to demand that B
satisfy his (her) need.

Again, (3) A can even morally

. resort not only to rational persua-

I leaders ‘ for.

. otherwi_se 

 

. .

means that nearly ten percent: of
the Chinese people have lost their
lives because they dared to hold
beliefs contrary to those of the
power elite. Few would denv when
confronted with these facts that
Mac and Chou have an undisputed
claim to the title of greatest mass
murderers of all time.

Even those within the Commu-
nist party were not spared. A Life
magazine story in 1954 tells of an
incident in the 305 where Chou had
a political rival killed along with the
‘man's eight relatives. These
hapless victims, including women
and children, were ruthlessly
beaten to death-by Chou’s personal
operatives. But one need not go

"back that far for evidence of such

reprehensible deeds. In the mid
sixties during the Great Cultural
Revolution, - over 3,000,000 people
were slaughtered by the fanatical

‘ Red Guard, who were unleashed by

Mao and Chou to purge the country
of any opposition, be it real or
imagined.

Even those Chinese who were
spared have little to thank: their
Political freedom is
nonexistent. Torture and brutality
are still the accepted means of
dealing with dissenters. And

sion but also to forceful means
which go against the voluntary
consent of B, to obtain those things
from B which will satisfy A’s
needs.

Finally, (4) If B does not want to

satisfy A's needs because, in
particular, B doesn't think (cor-
rectly or incorrectly) that he (she)
will “proﬁt" from doing so, then B
is being “insensitive" and -.“ruth-
less" in regard to'A’s needs.

Now my difﬁculties with these
four positions lie in the following. I
have an extremely strong need for
sex with intelligent and beautiful
women. And itjust so_happens that
there are many intelligent and
beautiful women around. Thus,
by_ positions (1). since such women
“have got what it takes" to satisfy
my need. then they must satisfy my
need; otherwise, they are acting
immorally. However. most of these
women don’t want to satisfy my
need, and/or most of them
on't satisfy my need

bodies are still found quite
frequently, washed up on the
beaches of Hong Kong. The
‘members of the press who are so
eager to praise the Red Chinese
paradise are quick to forget that
those same Reds were directly
responsible for 50,000 American
deaths in the Korean ,_War, and
even more in I)/ietnam as the result
of their constant aid to Hanoi. In
addition, Red Chineseaggression
has taken ito toll in India, Russia,
Tibet, and Taiwan, the home of the
true government of China, not to
mention the stirring up of
subversives throughout Asia and
the rest of the third World.

When one stops to reflect on the

depravity of the Communist regime .

in Peking, it is almost sickening to ,

listen to the news media fawn over '
‘ the “visionary qualities” of Mac or

the “personal warmth" of ‘Chou.
But far more disconcerting is the
fact that both the Nixon and Ford
administrations have pursued an
active‘ policy of increasing friendli-,_
ness toward these butchers. If we
are to allow our leaders to condone

‘such. a nightmarish system -of

government, how long can it be
before asimilar one_is imposed on
us here? ‘

   Moral Qu es tion  

(for whatever reasons).

But, by position (2), I have the
moral right to demand that any
intelligent and beautiful woman
satisfy my need. ~-

And. by position (3), lam acting
morally, not only if I try to
rationally persuade them to have
sex with me, but also if I use-force
against their voluntary consent to
obtain sex with them. That is, I am
morally permitted to rape" them. .
 Finally: by position (4), those
intelligent and beautiful women
who don't want to satisfy my needs
since they think (correctly or
incorrectly) that they won't “pro-
ﬁt" from having sex with me are,
thereby, “insensitive" and “ruth-
less" toward my needs.‘ In fact,

r they are “forcing" me into severe

states of depression in which I am
slowly smoking my way into death
by lung cancer. Thus, Ican say that
they are “murdering" me.

The implications which I have
sketchedout above from the four

at La Guardia Airport),' but an
honest-to-goodness wave of terror,

the kind that drives men to sell,

their homes and run off to the
mountains to await the apocalypse.

There is really only one reason

we need hysteria. Look around you. A

All you see is millions of normal
people going normally about their
normallives with nothing to divert
them from the trap of normality.

They are bored, so that makes me
bored, so let’s light a fire under
humanity’s collective rear end and
get things moving again. A

Tragic news events simply are
not rousing enough. Terrorist
bombings, ﬂoods, storms and wars
happen every day, and, they
always can be shrugged off as
affecting merely some other guy.
Only the strange, the unthinkable
will wake people from lethargy. No
one really cares about the pollution
in the Hudson River, but spread
the word that the Loch Ness
Monster is making it with’ the
Statue of Liberty and see how many
flock to the waterfront.

True hysteria, however, can be
bred only by the threat of common
disaster. When Orson Welles’
broadcast The War of the Worlds in

1938,. millions 5huddled in their‘

homes and waited for a martian to
come knocking‘ at. their doors.

Others began fleeing to the
countryside, and farmers started
shooting at their neighbors’ water

towers, thinking they were Martian
tripods. ‘

Of course, there was no real
danger, and soon people went back

> to their routine lives. But for those

few hours, millions were united by
the belief '- there would be no

. tomorrow.

' This hysteria was brief because
the threat was patently false.\It was
hysteria through hoax. Far more
effectiveis an hysteria produced by‘

"a real danger,» or at least what \

appears to be real.

My personal favorite occured in
1910, when much of the world
thought the Earth was about to be
plastered by I-lalley‘s Comet. The
chances of this are infinitesimally
small, lint the comet did sco_re a
near-miss. coming within aimillion
or so miles. . . ‘ .

This event did-more ‘than breed
sheer terror. It ‘caused the world to
engage in all '
debates. Was doomsday coming?

sorts of moral‘

A positions go very much against my

basic “intuitions” of what is
“morally acceptable." And my
resolution of the difﬁculties is that
these four positions have incorrect
notions of “force," “murder,"
“proﬁt." “insensitivity," “ruth-
lessness" and “responsibility.”

Iwould. nevertheless. love to see
any ot"r"r attempted resolutions of
nw ‘ 'lties.

elell _ A
 of history and
A _x:,of science

 

Would last-minute piety stay the
blow of the comet? Was this man’s_ _
last chance at salvation?

The doomsday hysteria has also
provided us with some of our finest
literature, from H.G. Wells’ 
Days of the Comet (based on‘ 
1910 near-disaster) to When

Worlds Collide, which graciously

permitted a few men to escape the 9

big bash.

But the hysteria saga does not
end here. There are those who
would try to create hysteria out of
their own personal biases. William
and Paul Paddock p_ublished a book
ominously titled, Famine: 1975.
This attempt at hysteria is easily
exposed, for everyone knows that it
is not our famine, but their famine.
Besides, the famine never came.
The only people starving ar , e
Asians and Africans, who alvl-.t..g:;_’s
have been "starving.

There is.a word for people‘ like
the Paddocks—crackpots.

— Just as there are people trying to
promote unworthy events to
hysteria, there are many excellent
candidates for hysteria that pass

without a stir. Nevil Shute (author «
, of On the Beach) predicted that

Earth’s ﬁnal -war would be "in 1968,
starting with an Egyptian attack on

«Tel,.Aviv. Shute had awhole string .

of accurate predictions concerning
World War II and the Cold War. So
when I heard of his prediction in
1967, I lived the next year 63
half in mortal fear. ‘-ii

-But I was alone. While ‘I awaited I

the end of the world in 1968,
everyone else was talking about the.

dangers of pollution, *overpopula- *

tion and poverty. Yet look at the
results. Pollution, overpopulation
and poverty still exist, and people
still talk about them. But my
vigilance in waiting for the end
paid off, for theend never came.

There is a-.simple moral to all of I

this. It is the duty of each of us to
promote true hysteria-producing
events. Be wary of those who
would have us go bananas over

‘ anything short of ultimate disaster.

Finally, begin making your own
preparations for the end. Whet J;

it is a fallout shelter or an island , 

the South, Pacific, find your own
hole to crawl for when the disaster

really does come. Then, when the » l '

Martians ﬁnally do attack Bayonne,‘ A I

President fl-lopefulsspeak Out Again

(Continued from Page 1)
LARRY CHABAN

“Yes, but not without a
referendum. Also, there is a
question whether the SG allocates
its money properly now. There
may be some reasons to raise it $1
or $2, but we'll have to look closely
at how we spend the money now.”

What experience do you have that
would make you a strong SGB
president?

“I have attended SGB meetings
for the past three years, and I feel I
know how it functions. This past
year I was president of the
Commuter Association and dealt

 with administrators.”

How would you increase student

involvement in SGB activities?
“That’s a big problem. Since

I’ve become involved, I’ve advo-

cated the Board members go out ‘

and talk more with the students.
You have to go sit down with them
and ask their opinions. They are
willing to talk, and tell you what
they feel is wrong. They just
haven’t been asked.”

fContinued from Page I) I
JOE GRONSKY

What experience do you have
that would make you a strong SGB
president?

“I served on the University
Athletic Committee, "where I had to
work with students, administration
and faculty. I got to know how the
University works and how Student
Government works as well."

How would you increase student
involvement in SGB activities? _

“I would like to see'a leaflet
published telling students exactly
what we are doing and how we can
help them. Once they see how we
affect them they would get
involved." '

How would you insure coopera-
tion of other major student groups?

“I would work closely with all the
leaders of other groups. This also
helps answer the last question,
because the leaders could go back
and tell students in their groups
what we are doing, and they could
all become involved that way.

 

{Continued from Page 1)
MARK SATINOFF

What experience do you have
that would make you a strong SGB
president?

“I've been on the SGB this past
year, and I've been involved in
political activity sine»: 1970. I'm
familiar with University red tape."

How would you increase student
involvement in SGB activities?

“If we deal with real problems,
such as those of women and blacks,
we will gradually pick up support.
The apathy we see now is
understandable;_not desirable, but
understandable.”

How would you insure coopera-
tion of other major student groups?
' “The gap isn’t between the
groups, but between the SGB and
the groups combined. We have
common interests—such as tuition
hikes, room and board—and I
would work to close the gap. They
see the Board as a privileged
clique. The Board has to stop
playing this game of privileges.”

(Continuedfrom Page I)
BARRY WEISBAND

What experience do you have that:
would make you a strong SGB
president?

“I've had two years involvement
on SGB committees, including
Legal Awareness,. Pitt Tenant
Union and Allocations (Commit-
tee). I think I am the most
experienced candidate at this
point. I have dealt with the
administration at all levels, and I
have assisted the Board on many
occasions."

How would you increase student
involvementin SGB activities?

“By showing exactly what we
can do, and doing something for
the students directly. One of my
ideas is to form a co—op, offering
reduced prices on such things as
food and records. When students
see how much we can do, they will
get involved. Also, we have to
keep contact with our committees.
This past year, they hardly ever
came to SGB meetings and gave
reports of any type.”

GROUNDHOG PHIL
STILL TOP DOG

Punxsutawney, Pa. (AP)——It’s
been cancelled by war, scoffed at

" by /meteorologists and rainedout.

Groundhog Day has survived it all

. ?for decades and today will again

feature Punxsutawney Phil, the
groundhog who supposedly pre-
dicts more winter -or an early

. spring.

A crowd will wait on Gobbler’s
Knob here, about 100 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh; to see if

‘ the hibernating Phil leaves his
‘burrow. Tradition says if he sees

his shadow, it's six more weeks of

' winter; if not, spring is not far off.

Weather predictions favor a
quick spring; today’s forecast is for_
snow. ‘

Censorship during World War II
restricted Phil’s predictions in

~ 1953, according to reports of the
~ time. During the 1950's, Pittsburgh
,_ -meteorologist Henry Rockwood
3 announced that in the six weeks

after Phil supposedly had seen his

Corrupt Race 3

shadow, temperatures were warm-
er and snow fall lighter.

The idea of a groundhog
predicting weather was brought to
this country by German settlers,

who ﬁgured if the sun shown on -

February 2, a smart animal would
see his shadow and race back to his /
burrow for six more weeks.

Punxsutawney became the focal
point for the groundhog’ predictions
about 75 years ago, when a group
of men called the Groundhog Club
met on this Knob to drink beer and
eat groundhog.

Pitt’s Own Watergate In ‘7O

BY BILL MOORE

Editor’s note: The invalidation of
and confusion surrounding the
recent Student Government Board
[SGB] presidential election does
not set a precedent. The Pitt News
checked its files and came up with a
brief history of one of Pitt’s more
memorable elections.

Unlike the loftier issues of
today—faculty unionization, foot-
ball tickets—Pitt’s student leaders
in 1970 had but one issue on which
to base their campaigns: Student
Government’s ineffectiveness.

I-Iarris Miller used two full-page
ads in The Pitt News and a
campaign manager named “Brook-
lyn” Sy Adler to defeat Steve
Cundra by 18 votes on Jan. 23. He
succeeded his friend Scott Baum as
head of Student Government.

It was a time of party politics,
and Cundra’s United Student
Coalition (USC) party rejected the
bitter taste of defeat. A foul-up in

the Registrar’s Office left a large‘

part of the student body without
validated IDs, so the USC claimed
that many students cou1dn’t vote.

On Feb. 4, a second election was
held.

Fewer students voted the second
time around, and Cundra snatched
Miller’s title of president-elect by
33 votes. This time, Miller’s
"Student Community Union (SCU)
party protested. _

The SCU provided photographic
evidence proving Cundra had left

his signs upon election day—a»

clear violation of campaign rules.’

Then Assistant Chancellor of
Student Affairs Bernard ‘Kobosky
(now vice chancellor for Public
Affairs), called the two candidates
together. The three agreed to allow
an impartial board of faculty and
administration arbiters to decide
the question.

On February. 16, they gave the
election to Cundra and scheduled

PLEASE STAND

his inauguration for the Feb. 27.
Cundra thought that was great.

And it was—until the day of his
inauguration. That afternoon, as
Cundra returned from a Harrisburg
meeting with state legislators to
talk about tuition hikes, his USC
Party treasurer Susan Davis
dropped the bombshell. Cundra,
she said, had spent $1,000 over the-
$200 he was legally allowed to shell
out for his campaign. Davis knew
this, she said, because he had kept
it in her bank account. The money,
she alleged, was a gift from
corporate executives.

She claimed- guilt and far had
forced.her to confess. Cundra had
paid for a Pitt News ad with a
check, and it had bounced.

“I realized what I did was wrong,
and I realized that if Cundra and
the others ‘agreed to mismanage
money campaign funds, they would
very likely do the same with Sudent
Government funds,” ‘Davis said.

The inauguration banquet had
been planned already. By the time
Davis revealed the dirt, it was too
late to call it off. So, with a ﬂair for
the dramatic, Cundra went through
with the noninaugural and denied
the charges in between bites of
undercooked chicken. -

‘‘I will not resign,” he said later.

“I fully intend to stand my ground,
and in. answer to many queries, I

up?

will never give up the ﬁght to
better this University.” _

He didn't resign. He’ served as
Student Government president
right up to April 26, when the
Student Government Senate mem-
bers decided to elect one of their
own—Lenny Klavonic-—to the posi-
tion. In early May,’ Klavonic listed
a number of things on which he
wanted to work "during his term.
The major change, he said, would
be to revamp the election code;

Cundra, presumably, just sulked
after he was dethroned.No one
seems to know where he is now.

Miller, the winner in the ﬁrst
election, is now studying interna-
tional politics at Yale.

And Klavonic, who spent ‘his
term in ofﬁce making administra-

of his own, recently graduated from

' Pitt Law School and is working for a

Pittsburgh law ﬁrm.

As for the election code, the code
Klavonic vowed to change, it has
been vamped, ‘ revamped, and
revamped. But the "post-election
battles; with all their nit-picking
contests and ﬁne-point appeals,
still erupt with unfortunate regular-
ity. _ ,

And the voters? Well, they still
watch with mild amusement and
wonder why the. Millers and the
Cundras want the job at all.

Buffy—Folk Singing Breed

BY VLISA RUBENSTEIN

. , A long time ago (way back in the

made use of their music to plug
causes and ﬁght against wars and
other evil things.. 1

Saturday night, at Carnegie

showed the crowd that social

Sainte-Marie never let her

audience forget her Indian extrac-

the American Indian movement.
No one could forget, from the
moment she stepped out with
‘Indian feathers tied to her hair to
her singing of

“He’s an Indian Cowboy in the
Rodeo” with the lusty, sometimes
shrill vibrato that can be described
only as Buffy.

The best parts of the concert
were the few songs on which

Sainte-Marie stood alone on the,

stage‘, using her finest instrument
—her voice—to send electric
shivers through the audience with
songs like “Soldier Blue” and
“Cripple Creek,” which she sang
while accompanying herself on a
mouth bow.

Chamber Concert mixes

Music, Styles on Bill gt

, BY PAMELA EUSI

A program of German “dinner
music,” an early Romantic piece,
and contemporary Swiss and
American compositions fit the bill
for the Pittsburgh Symphony’s
Chamber Music concert this
weekend. * ~

Haydn’s Symphony No. 7. in C
Major belongs to the Baroque,
concerto grosso style of Bach.
Haydn started composing a cycle of
symphonies to illustrate with music
the divisions of the day from
morning to night. Three of the
scores (bearing French subtitles)
are preserved—the fourth is lost.

The cgsy chamber orchestra
(including harpsichord) under the
direction of Donald Johanos attack-
ed ‘the piece with its typical
professional frenzy. Haydn wrote
for the royal Austrian court and this
part of the “day” cycle was
performed as dinner music during
the grand midday meal. The

orchestra Friday night breathed life

into the work, and it seemed like
something more than “dinner
music.” .

Piano soloist Lorin Hollander
presented a vigorous artistic

, picture in the Concerto No. 2 in

B-flat Major for Piano and
Orchestra, Opus 19 by Beethoven.

Nowithat the strike is over . . . . .

Hollander had just the right touch
for Beethoven and didn’t go
overboard in his dramatics like a lot
of pianists have a tendency to do.
The second movement contained
sections of tenderness, warmth and
expression. The piece needed
something extra to make a ‘better
overall impression than it did.
Appalachian Spring by Aaron
Copland premiered in 1944 as a
ballet written for Martha Graham.
The form used in concert is a
Concert Suite extracted by Copland
from the ballet. The story concerns

a young farming couple in the;

Appalachian countryside.
hymn-like beginning to the majes-
tic theme of a Shaker tune, “The
Gift To be Simple,” Copland lifted
the orchestra on the wings of
superb harmonics and mood
changes. The ﬁnale expressed a
muted prayer effect. '
The last piece, Concerto for
Seven Wind Instruments, Strings
and Percussion by Frank Martin,
left a vacuum in the program. The
themes evolved from revolutionary
tone patterns and the result was
well-performed but ﬂat. The
energy came from the percussion
instruments in the third movement,
but that still wasn’t enough to leave
with the best impression possible.

But her finest song of the
evening was “Universal Soldier,”
a classic anti-war song and
Sainte-Marie's first hit. She sang it
with the sort of intensity that
makes the song as true today as it
was in the ’60s.

And that’s Sainte-Marie’s sec-
ret. Other performers may sing as
well or compose more complicated
arrangements, but they’re singing
about rainy days and lost loves.
Buffy Sainte-Marie may have
evolved, but she’s still as emotional
and meaningful as she ever was.

Everyone expects to see an
encore at a rock concert, and
Sainte-Marie obliged by singing
“Until It’s Time For You to Go,” a
song made famous by Bobby Darin.
There had to be a lot of energy in
Sainte-Marie’s performance for the
audience to insist she came out
again.

And she came out the second

time with a song from her Sweet
America album, to be released in
the spring. And the new material
is as explosive and moving as
anything she has written. ~
. Pitt Programming and -th
Undergraduate Women’s Union
brought Pitt another treat Saturday
night when they brought in Linda
Cohen, billed as a “virtuoso guitar
player.” The audience didn’t quite
expect Cohen’s all-instrumental
performance, but it got a taste of a
musical genre that is hard to come
by in Pittsburgh.

Cohen is amazingly versatile, as
she showed in such diverse tunes
as the light-ﬂowing “Mononga-
hela” and the more flashy,
earthy-sounding “Mad vMan
Samba,” played in open G tuning.

Although Cohen could have used
’a little more spice and energy in an
act that dwelt heavily on classical
guitar, she is no doubt one of the
most skilled guitar players seen at.

Where can you go on a Friday
night in Oakland for a relaxing
evening? How about the Lutheran
University Magic Theatre Cafe
Coffeehouse (sic)? Admission is
only 50 cents per person, and the
drinks and snacks are priced quite
reasonably.

Although the entertainment is
far from excellent, it is nonetheless
enjoyable. There were banjo
players singing Irish folk son gs and
English, Irish and Australian lyric
songs. _

A good stand-up comedian and a

‘young magician, along with several
other acts, provided entertainment
for the friendly, relaxed audience.
About the time one tired of live
entertainment, a short ﬁlm such as

W.C. Fields’ The Big Thumb was’

shown.
I asked several of those present

B””Y 3i”95 i°' C'°Wii E Relax at YMCA coffeehouse

why they came and got answers
such as “Nothing else to do,” and
“It looked interesting.” One
member of the audience said, “lt’s
a change from the fraternity rush
parties.” 7

The crowd was mostly young
people from about the upper-teens
to the mid-twenties. Most seemed

to be enjoying themselves——they A

joked with the performers. Once in
a while, a familiar song would be
played and the crowd would sing
along.

If you are thinking about
attending the next Lutheran
University Coffeehouse, I would
suggest you go early to get one of
the 50 seats (although there_ is
space to sit on the ﬂoor).

Most people would find the
entertainment and atmosphere
enjoyable, while at the same time
knowing their money is going to a A
good cause.

Lose, 21-14  

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

In the words of wrestling Coach
Dave Adams: “Theroof caved in.”
An adequate appraisal, as Millers-
ville State “managed” a 21-14 win
over the injury-riddled Panthers
(10-2).

“We, were wrestling with a
patchwork lineup. Craig Phillips
(126) is out with the ﬂu. Rande
Stottlemyer (134) has a back injury
and won’t be ‘around for at least
another week,” Adams said. ,

S_kip Bolin, who wrestles in the
158-pound class, suffered an
emergency appendectomy and is
deﬁnitely out for the rest of the

_season. If that isn't enough, you

can also find Ray Dallatore (167) in
the emergency ward. -
, “We’ve had our share of

. hardships,-but I’m not offering that

as an excuse,” a dejected Adams
said.

Regulars Kevin Nellis (118), Bob
Bailey (142), Bill Korth (150) and
Bill Bailey (190) won their matches,
but without their usual teammates’
support, their efforts were to no
avail.

“Rob Myers, our team manager,
had to wrestle at 126.» He deserves
_a lot of credit,” Adams said.

  Tankers Top Terps,
Keep Streak Alive

BY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

The meet started innocently
enough. The undefeated Panther
swim team marched out of the
locker room single ﬁle, clapping
hands in unison and shouting “We
want Maryland."

The Cats had not rested well for
the meet but were pretty conﬁdent
that Maryland would present a

weak challenge at best. The Terps,’

though, had rested arid wanted to
win very badly. So they gave the
Panthers a run for their money, but
fell short, 63-50. .

Maryland's challenge became
evident in the first event as in the
400-yard medley relay. Neal
Wallace took a slight lead in the
backstroke, but Bob Hasset of
Maryland took the lead over
Orlando Catinchi in the breast-
stroke. Carlos Santiago couldn’t
make up the lost distance in the
butterﬂy, leaving it all up to Dave

‘ Civis.

Civis had helped stage an upset
of Kent State’s relay only a week
before with a ﬁne effort in the
freestyle anchor of the race. This
time though, Civis could not quite
make up all the distance between
himself and the Terrapin.

“I should ‘have had him,”

‘mumbled Civis to’ Coach Dick

Bradshaw. Bradshaw smiled ‘be-
cause he knew that in the next
event he could easily make up the
7-0 deﬁcit. ‘

Jerry DeMuro, as he has all year,
took a commanding lead in the

1,000-yard freestyle and never.

gave it up, double-lapping his
nearest competitor. Bob Green-
wald’s second place for the
Panthers helped even the score at
eight. A

The euphoria that came with the
win in the distance event ended
quickly when Paul Kozicki of

Maryland captured ﬁrst place in

the 200-yard freestyle, ﬁnishing
ahead of Pitt’s John Schepner_ and
Bob Clemmer.

Kozicki’s effort put the Terrapins
ahead, 13-12. but Pitt took over in
the 50-yard freestyle sprint when
Steve Leach and Civid “one-
twoed” Maryland to take the lead
right back. 20-14'.

Pitt's divers dominated the
one-meter board; Dave Reeder took
first place while teammate Tom
Fatyol took second.

DeMuro followed the divers’
performance with a ﬁrst-place

‘ﬁnish in the butterﬁy——the second

of his three ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes of
the day—but the Maryland team
was not down yet.

They attempted one last —grasp at
victory when Hasset spoiled
another team record performance.
This time it was Catinchi that came
in second place; he couldn’t catch
up to the Maryland breaststroker.

The swimmers looked at the
scoreboard confidently because
they“‘knew” the divers would ice
the’ victory for them, but whatever
happened on that three-meter

diving board, the‘ Panthers sure ’

didn’t win. «

Fatyol garnered a second-place
behind freshman Steve Shinholzer
of Maryland, but the other divers
were conspicuous in their absence

“It’s very rare that you can
afford to lose both relays (14
points) and still win a meet,”
Bradshaw said. “They really
surprised us.”

The Panthers had still won,
63-50, but they had been caught
looking ahead. Looking ahead to a
meet with Ohio State, the Panthers
had relented slightly in their
pursuit of a Maryland victory, but
maybe they can be forgiving for
looking ahead just this

Invitational A Success

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Seventh Annual Pitt Invita-
tional Track Meet on Friday and
Saturday was successful in many
ways. Three meet records were
broken and many personal bests
were recorded by both the male
and female athletes.

Friday night saw Keith Neff of
Virginia‘ Tech smash the meet
record by nearly two feet in the
pole vault. Neff was awarded the
1976 Outstanding Field Athlete
award for his 17-foot vault.

\~.~
_./

West Virginia’s Alex Kasich was
in pre-Olympic form as he ran his
opposition into the track with

meet-record performances in the -

two- and three-mile runs. His
eforts earned him the 1976
Outstanding Track Athlete award.

The Panthers had a productive
afternoon; many did well against
stiff competition.

In the mile run, Pitt’s Nick
Martin set the pace for most of the
race, but lost to Kent State’s Mike
Dubina, who edged Martin on the
ﬁnal lap. Martin’s 4:06.7 was his
fastest open indoor mile, and Dave
McDonald also ﬁnished strong with
a mark of 4212.2.

Karl Farmer successfully de-
fended his 440-yard dash title in a
close race, with a time of 49.5_.
The Panthers had an exceptional
day- in the ﬁeld events. They
captured one first- and two
second-place ﬁnishes. Sophomore
Keith Taylor was in matchless
form, winning the high jump and
placing second in the triple jump.

Freshman Eric Drescher was

runner-up in the 16-pound shot put A

with a toss of 53-7.

The Pitt Tracksters ended the
meet on a good note and, despite a
power failure, won both the one-
and two-mile relays. Willie Walker

and Farmer combined to form an
unbeatable duo in the mile relay,
and in the 2-mile event, Martin
gave Pitt the edge it needed to
score Pitt’s second victory in as
many events.

Gymnasts Lose Again .

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pitt gymnastics teams both
wound up on the losing end
Saturday night, this time falling
victim to Slippery Rock. The men’s
team, now 0-4 for the season, went
down, 166.65-158.25. The Rock
also held ﬁrm against the Panther-
ettes, 96.0-88.9.

The Panthers’ loss, though, is
deceptive. Injuries and all, they are
improving. Cold facts back it up:
against Temple, Pitt lost by nearly
25 points; against Slippery Rock,
the lead was sliced to nearly a third

.of that ﬁgure.
Moreover, traditional Pitt
‘strongholds such as the pommel

horse and horizontal bars are
winning even more points for the
team.

Saturday night saw the usual
performance from team captain
Don Stevenson. Still hampered by a
shoulder injury, Stevenson was
back in old form, winning the
parallel bar competition _with 7.15
points. -

\ Whereas the men actually had a
chance for victory until their weak
spot—the rings——came up, the
Pantherettes were out of it from the

. opening moments.

Slippery Rock has one of the best
women’s gymnastics squads in the
country, and its performances at
Pitt reinforced the reputation.

The Panthers took the lead on

because they failed to adequately
clear the puck and gave.Ohio too

score tied.

But with goaltender Larry Newill

the Bearcat attack and raise its
record to 6-3-1.

“Newill kept us in the game,”
said coach Len Barcalow. “We

Larry was tough to heat. It was
unfortunate to see that penalty on

A YABLONSKI MURDI:.‘R’S
CONVICTION UPHELD

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—Penn-
sylvania Supreme Court yesterday
upheld the murder conviction of
Albert E. Pass in the 1969
Shootings of United Mine Workers

leader Joseph “Jock" Yablonski-X/-,‘i,,,

and his wife and daughter.

Pass. 55, was accused of
accepting the murder contract from
W.A. “Tony" Boyle, then national
president of the UMW, and setting
up the slayings through a fund
ﬁnanced out of the union treasury.

Boyle also was convicted of the
three murders in 1974 and like
Pass, now is serving life imprison-
ment. .

The seven justices of the state’s
rejected Pass’
appeal that Pennsylvania courts
lacked proper jurisdiction to try
him to murder.

/

Pass claimed he was arresteT§“7~’

first by federal agents on a charge
of conspiring to deprive Yablonski
of his civil rights and was taken to
Pittsburgh for arraignment. There,
in May 1972, Pass was arrested by
state ofﬁcials and charged with

. murder.

HOUSE VETOS FORD’S
SECOND BILL

WASHINGTON (AP)—By a 4-1
margin, the House yesterday
approved a $6.1 billion antire-
cession bill President Ford has
vowed to veto.

The measure was the second
administration-opposed bill win-
ning House approval in two days.

Congress overrode Ford’s earliegf.
veto of a $45 billion labor, health,"‘7"

education and welfare spending bill
on Wednesday.

KISSINGER GIVESTOUGH.
SOVIET LINE

WASHINGTON (AP)—Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger yes-
terday outlined an intensiﬁed hard
line anti-Soviet foreign policy,
saying the United States must be
prepared to react against any
massive Russian adventure.

He told a Senate subcommittee

(studying Angola that ‘‘I am not

saying we will police every area in

the world. . .but wherever the Sovie'xE_C‘I"T_
Union moves hostilely, we must "

commit ourselves.

“I believe we must discourage
the view that the Soviet Union can
move anywhere it wants without
serious risk," Kissinger said.
