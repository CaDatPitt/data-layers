Fortner state house speaker addresses excellence in law  

Pitta drinking ‘campus according to SHS survey

By Mike Hudson
Staff Writer

Approximately one-third of Pitt
students are virgins, another one-
third has engaged in unintended
sex as a result of drinking alcohol
and one—fourth have admitted to
driving while drunk, according
to a study by a University of
Pittsburgh health educator.

“I’m concerned with the way
students neglect their health. I
get the impression that a lot of
times students don’t realize the
long—term effects of what they do
to themselves,” said Dr. Shirley
Haberman of Student Health
Services.

Haberman conducted her
survey on substance abuse,

V sexual practices, dietary habits,
stress management and other

emotional problems in an effort
to learn more about the health-
compromising behaviors of Pitt
students. The results of the survey
of undergraduate students’
lifestyles will be used as a basis
for future health-promotion
programs to be aimed at helping
students deal with the pressures
associated with college life.

“It's a fairly good assessment
of [student] behaviors. We found

- that most of the practices follow

national trends. In fact, Pitt
students seem to be a bit more
conservative," said Frank W.

Carter, director of Student Health
Services.

According to the results of the
survey, students perceive classes,
tests and grades as the greatest
cause of stress in their lives.
Relationships rank second, and
financial problems are third on
the list. .

To relieve stress, according to
the survey, 24 percent of the
respondents say they exercise.
Eighteen percent resort to drugs.
Seventeen percent eat food and 5
percent drink alcohol.

Other popular forms of stress
management include: taking a
bath or shower (19 percent),
breathing or relaxation exercises
(14 percent), talking to a friend (2
percent) and reading or watching
television (2 percent).

The survey revealed that even
though drug use among students
is declining, alcohol consumption
remains relatively high, despite
the prevalent attitude that college
students consider themselves
responsible drinkers.

“We’re not a heavy illicit drug-
using campus,” said Haberman.
“However, I’m concerned with
the destructive way alcohol is
used by students.” ,

According to Haberman, 85

percent of the students have used,

alcohol in the past and 56 percent
consider themselves to be regular
drinkers (drinking once a week

Racial suit against Pitt, economics chairman to be tried

  

Christopher McCall
Staff Writer

A former Pitt doctoral candidate and
teaching fellow has filed a civil—rights
action against the university and the
economics department chairman, alleging
that he was unlawfully terminated from
his position as a result of racial
discrimination and expressing his rights of
free speech.

Suresh Denam claims that Kevin
Sontheimer, chairman of the department
of economics, had implemented a
discriminatory policy.

 

  ll ll)),l[’y T

      

“He [Denam] was fired because he was
expressing his right to free speech. The
university was promoting only white
Americans to positions of teaching fellows.
At that time, all of the advanced teaching
fellows in their fourth and fifth years were
held exclusively to white Americans, ” said
Denam’s lawyer Richard Johnson.

According to Denam, he first noticed
racial discrimination as a student of
Sontheimer when “foreign students would
receive inferior grades [compared to those
of] white students.” But Denam did not
begin to complain until July of 1987‘ after
his mailbox was moved away from his

office, and Sontheimer had ordered that
his phone messages not be taken.

Denam then accused Sontheimer of
issuing an “exception” which resulted in
two white Americans receiving fifth-Yltar
teaching appointments.

Denam began to publish a series of A»

News Views newsletters in the economics
department describing what he saw as the
racially motivated actions of Sontheimer.
He also filed a formal “grievance” with the
University Review Board, seeking
justification for his charges against
Sontheimer of racial discrimination.

In December of 1987, Sontheimer filed

an appeal of the grievance and asked the
board to consider a disciplinary dismissal
of Denam. He charged that Denam’s

newsletters had been unlawfully published A

on university letterheads and that Denam
was a threat to the secure fumre of the
economics department.

Sontheimer had no’ comment when
reached at his office but was quoted
during the trial as saying, “The way things
stand now, an individual cannot walk
down the hall without concern that some
encounter with Mr. Denam will be turned‘

and fabricated into an incident that will

Survey

Continued from page 1
encouraging, but the fact that 25
percent of the sexually active
respondents say they “take their
chances" and do not use any
form of contrace ption is alarming.

Haberman was also interested
in the fact that even though the
percentage of virgins reported by
both sexes was almost equal (35
percent for men and 32 percent
for women), twice the number of
men than women reported having
multiple sexual partners (two or
more) within the six-month
period prior to the survey.

“It wasn’t surprising that men
have had more sexual partners
than women, but it does concern
me that so many people have
multiple partners, because the
chances of transmitting sexual
diseases increases with the
number of partners you have,”
Haberman said. A

She said that 22 percent of the
respondents reported having
multiple partners. ’

Results of the survey also
revealed that 12 percent of the
female respondents reported
being victims of rape by date or
acquaintance. And 19 percent
admitted to being victims of
attempted rape by a relative or
acquaintance. 0

Comparing the results of her
survey with national statistics,

Habe-rman saidPitt is pretty much »

on par with the rest of the country.

“Though it’s difficult to find
exact comparisons between my
survey and other studies
conducted at other schools, the
comparisons that I could make

show Pitt to be on average with

national trends,” she said.

According to Haberman, drug
use at Pitt is on the lower end of
the spectrum and ' alcohol
consumption seems to be
consistent with national trends.

“I was impressed with the
findings. We seem to be a fairly
conservative campus. It turns out
that Pitt is not the den of iniquity
that some people might have
thought it to be," she said.

Haberman conducted the
survey of 1,000 students during
the winter term of 1989. The
subjects were randomly selected
by computer from a list of full-
time students.

Each student was mailed a
packet containing a cover letter
explaining the "purpose of the
study and a questionnaire. The
subjects were instructed to remain

anonymous regarding the
questionnaire.
As an incentive to the

respondents, they were instructed

affairs to the black lawyers; to the

continued. “If you don't defend

The packets were mailed to
700 undergraduates and 300
graduate students. A response
rate of 40 percent (254
undergraduates and 146
graduates) was reported by
Haberman.

Since the focus of the study
was to learn more about the
lifestyles of traditional college
students, Haberman used only
the research obtained from the
undergraduate respondents.

Based on the demographic
information obtained from the
survey, a profile of the average
respondent is a white female,
between the ages of 18 and 22,
who comes from a middle-
income family and lives off
campus. H

Haberman believes her. survey
represents “to a “ large degree”
the overall response, of the

student population.
“I’m not saying my survey is a
perfect representation of all the

students at Pitt, but I believe it is ,

good sample of how the
‘traditional student’ would
respond to the survey.”

The findings thatwere the most
disturbing to Haberman was the
fact that so many students
continue to drink and drive,
despite all the public-awareness
programs aimed at preventing
drunk driving.

“Students have to realize that
some of the habits they acquire
as young adults will more than
likely affect the way they live the
rest of their lives,” she said.

Commenting on the results of
the survey, Carter said, “Overall,
the findings are pretty much what
we expected. It gives an idea on
how to develop educational
programs. I think we need to
focus more attention on alcohol
abuse and contraceptive usage.”

Kappa Alpha Psi ’steps ’
into entertainment light

By Joseph Bruce
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh's chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity, a leader in step shows, performed in front of a packed
audience Friday night at the Benedum Auditorium.

Stepping could be described as rapping to a beat created by
the performers stomping on the stage. Kappa Alpha Psi takes
this to a higher level by introducing canes. They maneuver the
canes in a way comparable to that of a precision drill team.

Stepping and Kappa Alpha Psi go as far back as the fraternity’s 1

founding in 1911. The Kappa Alpha Psi chapter at Pitt opened
in 1937.

The Nupes, as they refer to themselves, have never lost a step
contest, according to Anthony Booth, a brother of Kappa Alpha
Psi. Their two months’ preparation time was evident, and the
audience appreciated it. Kappa Alpha Psi’s unique style of using
canes with their stepping is a trademark of not only their
stepping, but also a symbol of their fraternity. The show opened
with the Kappa sweethearts from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania. After this, Pitt's own Kappa sweethearts came out
and stepped. The.Nupes then came out and pumped up the
crowd.

University Counsel Andrew
Hughey explains that “the
university, under the Buckley
Amendment, can’t go into detail
about the case unless Mr. Denam
waives the right.” The Buckley
Amendment says that releasing a
student’s record, or even
discussing a student's record, is
illegal without the student’s
permission. '

given full due process. The
university did not discriminate
against Mr. Denam. On the
contrary, we encourage foreign
students to attend. We believe
that we’ll be fully vindicated when

we go to trial," said Hughey.

“Mr. Denam began drawing
attention to the fact

a discriminatory fashion. He blew
the whistle on the economics

Economics professor Rueben
Slesinger, Ph.D, disagrees, “In
our department, about two-thirds

complaints, that there aren’t
enough Americans, and students
can’t understand them." He was
not sure, however, if those non-

A Pitt Varsity Lacrosse T eam

Former Cleveland Brown greatJim Brown, arguably the
greatest running back ever to put on an NFL uniform, was

. an excellent lacrosse player at Syracuse University. Not-

withstanding the numerous rushing records that he broke,

I Brown once remarked that his true love was the sport of

lacrosse and that if there would’ve been as professional

lacrosse league, he would’ve opted for that profession
instead of pro—football.

Pitt’s lacrosse-club, which finished its last season with a

10-4 record in the Allegheny Valley Lacrosse League, is

currently seeking varsity status from the university athletic I

department. This would enable the team to receive
financial support from the university. But financial con-
cerns are the principal reason why there are no plans for

.elevating the team to varsity status, which would allowiit
the opportunity to compete in the prospective Big East
lacrosse conference.

, f However, financial problems should not be a barrier -to
the lacrosse club's aspirations. There are 18 varsity sports
at Pitt, and a new one has not been added in 24 years.

. Coach Gary Neft said that the team's budget added up to

only about $5,000; tennis is the least- expensive university
sport with a cost of $15,000. Additionally, he noted that
he would not ask for any new scholarships, obviously
considering the fact that Pitt gives less than 60 percent of
the amount of scholarships that the NCAA permits,
according to-associate director of athletics, Dean Billick.

‘This is a noble sacrifice by N eft, considering that lacrosse
is the second most popular sport at Pitt in number of
participants, next to football, and that the team will add
18 freshmen and several transfers this year.

Among the benefits of adding lacrosse to the university’s
varsity curriculum is that it would allow the team the
possibility to compete with the Big East lacrosse power-

house, Syracuse. This would eventually catapult the team
to respectability merely by rivaling against such apromi-
nent school. 0
’ Also, Pittsburgh has become one of a limited number of
cities to enter a franchise in the Major Indoor Soccer
League, which has attracted some decent numbers this
year in terms of fan attendance.

A top priority for any major university is to recognize
and respond to the desires of its students. It is quite
evident that there is a strong student interest at the
University of Pittsburgh for a varsity lacrosse team. Pitt
should capitalize on the’ popularity of this potential sport
of the future by elevating it to the serious position of
varsity status.

Will the real

Recently, my roommates and I
were involved in a hearing in
which we sued our former land-
lord, Charles J. Greve & Co.
Although we have proof, in the
form of cancelled checks,‘that we

paid our rent, he decided to-

withhold our security deposit.
The letter we received informing
us of his decision said simply,
“S.D. withheld for rent.” By the
way, a security deposit can only
be withheld for damages — not
unpaid rent. Thirty days after a
lease is over, the landlord must
return the security deposit. If
deductions were made, the re-
maining money must be sent
along with an itemized list of
damages for which the‘ tenants
were held responsible. After 30
days a landlord can be sued for
double the security deposit. This
is what we did, and we won.
To prevent future problems for
yourself, here is a suggestion.
Before signing a lease, research
the reputation of the landlord.
This can easily be done by ques-
tioning the current tenants of the
place you wish to rent. Do this
on your own time, not in the
presence of the landlord. We
were suckered into our “student
housing” last year by a landlord
who promised new furniture,
kitchen appliances and new car-
peting. The rent was cheap, the
place was big, and he seemed
honest. We gotthe new furni-
ture, including a new stove. Was
it our fault that we didn't have
him specify in the lease that the
stove would be hooked up? This
minor operation required us call-
ing and/or stopping in his office
on McKee Place every day for
one month. How about leaks?
We had them. Not only was our
kitchen flooded when the snow
thawed, but our hallway always
had buckets collecting drips and
downpours from the upstairs
bathroom. “The cleaning crew
will have your apartment ready.”
If so, then why did we have to
S.O.S the shower walls, vacuum
the cobwebs from the brick and
scrub the grease from the kitchen
with Lestoil? “lf you need any-
thing to insulate your place, stop
by the of lice and pick itup. If we

Greve please stand up? it

don’t have it, buy it yourself, and
we’ll reimburse you.” I person-
ally mailed copies, of receipts
twice and stopped in the office
once to give them a third copy.
Tothis day I'm still minus at least
$50. I paid for a new deadbolt,
and my dad installed it in our

  Letters

front door. The one that was
there broke, and after being
robbed oncealready, I wasn’t
about to rely on their speedy
servicemen to promptly put in a
new one. Then there was that
one evening when we were all
downstairs and heard a loud
BOOM! What could it be this
time? Oh, it was only an upstairs
bedroom’s drop ceiling — drop-
ping. This took two months to
replace. _

Enough complaining. I can go
on for hours. The bottom line is
to take your time when finding
an apartment, and most impor-
tantly, talk to people who have
lived in “student housing.” Our
former landlord is appealing the
decision which was in our favor,
so our problems haven't ended
yet. -
“We specialize in student hous-
ing"??? “We've got our hands on
student housing”??? The only thing
they've got their hands on is our
money, and we're still Greve-ing
about it.

I was very disappointed by
your Feb. 13, 1990 article entitled
“Greve—ances” and your editorial
entitled “On the freedom of
speech.” Oakland Real Property
Associates, L.P., of which I am
the managing partner, owns in
excess of 250 student rental units

in Oakland and has employed
Charles J. Greve & Co. to manage
those units. Oakland Real Prop-
erty is committed to providing
quality housing to students, and
I believe Charles}. Greve & Co. is
equally committed to that prin-
ciple. My inspections of the rental
units (I stayed in a unit during a
January 1990 visit) and the ex-
penditures by Oakland Real
Property for capital improve-
ments and maintenance during
the past 12 months contradict the
position taken by The Pitt News
in thelGreve-ances article, to wit,
that Charles J. Greve 8: Co. is
providing inadequate orinferior
housing to students.

Student housing is at best a
difficult undertaking — vandal-
ism and destruction of property
by students is commonplace, and
an inordinate amount of time is
spent collecting rents and suing
students who have damaged their
rental units or departed without
fulﬁlling their rental obligations.
Of course, all rental properties
can be improved. The problem is
that the cost to eliminate all the
shortcomings related to student

housing would result in dramati-

cally higher rents. To achieve a
balance between quality housing
and reasonable rental rates in the
student housing context is ex-
tremely difficult. In view of the
difficult nature of the business, I
believe Charles J. Greve & Co.
has done a very good job of
providing quality student hous-
ing at a reasonable cost.

The disconcerting aspect of
your article and editorial is that
they present a view of Charles J.
Greve & Co. ’s performance which
was not subjected to objective
testing and scrutiny or a careful
editorial process. Printing a story
constitutes an implicit endorse-
ment of the “facts” contained in
the story. Readers believe the
facts have been tested and that
the report is professional and
objective. The power to so sway
public opinion carries with it the
responsibility to objectively and
accurately report the facts. In
order to do so, I believe The Pitt‘
News should have investigated

Protectionist measures are not good for America...

A recent ad purchased by the
powerful sugar lobby in this
country claimed that Americans
pay far less for sugar than their
counterparts in most European
nations and that sugar costs are
only a small percentage of the
average food bill. The reality,
though, is that consumers in this
country pay more than six times
the world price for sugar, due to
stringent import controls de-
signed to protect American grow-
ers of expensive sugar beets.

Sugar beets are a very ineffi-
cient source of sugar compared
to sugar cane, which is grown in
more tropical regions than can
be found in most of the United
States. The production of sugar
cane is concentrated mostly in
developing countries, which have
been hurt badly by such quotas
in this country. Consequently,
these nations have required huge
amounts of American aid to stay
aﬂoat, and several have recently

defaulted on payments of their
debts. It is obvious that not only
do American consumers suffer
from these import restrictions,
but so do the U.S. government
and the citizens of these less-
developed nations.

The preceding real—life example
demonstrates clearly why pro-
tecting American industries does
not work. While the small num-
ber of Americans who work in
the protected industry appear to
benefit initially from this action
by the government, millions more
pay with higher prices, not to
mention the cost to other na-
tions’ economies. Also, ironically,
this protectionism often proves
to be the downfall of the pro-
tected industry in the end. As
proof of that fact, I offer an
example closer to home: the
American steel industry.

That the United States, with its
large deposits of iron ore, coal
and lime (the essential ingredi-

ents for steel making), should be
outdone in price by Japan, with
none of these resources, is mind-
boggling. The reason is, of course,
that American steel companies
had essentially no foreign com-

Lewis

petition in the domestic market
for many years because of ex-
tremely high tariffs and quotas.
The steel mills in this country

were not modernized and as a
result became extremely ineffi-
cient and costly. When the Japa-
nese steel industry became effi-
cient enough to sell steel at prices
that even undercut domestic steel
without tariffs, the Americans
simply found themselves in a
position in which they couldn’t
compete. This, more than any-
thing else, caused the crisis in the
American steel industry in the
early 19805.

Most economists, including
Nobel laureate Milton Friedman,
assert that import quotas are
counterproductive. Yet certain
more liberal politicians keep
insisting that they are needed.
Pat Schroeder, for one, recently
stated on national television that
this country had to “find the right
mix” between government and
private control of the economy
that would include stifling import
restrictions. Governor Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts made

this point a central feature in his
recent presidential campaign.
Their embrace of this ﬂawed
theory is motivated entirely by
the desire to woo labor unions
and other working-class voters,
with total disregard for free—en-
terprise policies that would truly
be in the best interests of the
working class.

Only by letting American in-
dustry fail or succeed according
to how efficiently the industry is
run and not artificially protecting
them through import quotas and
taxes can the government guar-
antee that domestic industries
remain competitive. Any eco-
nomic policy for this country that
does not acknowledge this simple
tenet of free enterprise is bound
for failure at the expense of mil-
lions in the United States and
abroad.

It is “tit for tat” time, America.

On Feb. 16, a major news
network revealed that the trade
deficit has dropped to $108 bil-
lion, its lowest level in 5 years. It
is no gainsaying that the United
States has the freest trade policy
in the world. However, the cham-
pion of democracy is no longer a
creditor but a net debtor. Opin-
ions on and sources of this prob-
lem are diverse, but a substantial
section of the U.S., if not the
majority, believe that America's
troubles simultaneously rise with
the sun in Nippon (i.e., Japan).

Scanning matters critically is
not Japanese bashing. One does
not need to subscribe to any
particular school of thought to
see America mortgaging her
destiny to Japan.

It is true that with competition
from abroad, U.S. firms are bound
to ameliorate the quality of their
products. Nobody disputes that.

. But the dark side of the problem

lies in other factors. A quarter of
Silicon Valley is now owned by
the Japanese. Examine the auto-
mobiles on our highways —-— one
out every five are Japanese-made,
they aren’t even made in Sweden
(who retains the best automobile
record, according to a recent
survey). Ford Escort has ceded
her position as best seller to the
Honda Accord. The Walkman,
VCR and other electronic con-
sumer goods from Nippon per-
fume households, people and
streets in America. There is need
for concern, for the economic
domination and threat from Nip-

pon is even physically perceived '

before that from Bonn, London
or Brazil.

An African proverb goes: a
toad does not jump in the day-
time for nothing.” Fine. But who
owns Rockefeller Centre, Waikiki
Beach and CBS Records? Who

has exacerbated the closing of
many domestic plants by the big
three (i.e., Ford, Chrysler and

    

Boe
N demping

GM)? Any investor knows what
he reaps. Ventures from Nippon
are consequently not for noth-
ing.

If every nation restricts trade,
who will buy? Well, it is restricted

in Japan, and they expect Ameri-
cans to keep on burying Sears,
General Electric and other firms
while propping up Sharp,
Toshiba, Hitachi, Toyota and
Mitsubishi. And not only Ameri-
cans are acerbic on Japan, but
Europeans are as well. The French
recently told Japan Prime Minis-
ter Kaifu, that they are out to
dominate the world. When West-
ern firms withdrew from South
Africa to usher in. a wind of
change, the Japanese replaced
them and were conferred the
status of “honorary whites” ac-
cording to an article in a major
magazine. To divide and sell here
in the United States, some of our
smart guys made derogatory
remarks about blacks and his-
panics. Back in Nippon, they
unanimously branded the United
States — a nation of more than
240 million souls —-— racist Ironi-
cally, darker-skinned Asians from

Pakistan and other countries suffer
unbridled racist hurdles in Japan.
Where do we go from here? A
good solution is for the United
States to deal with the potential
Japanese threat on a “tit for tat”
basis. The Japanese kiss trade
restrictions when dealing with
us. We have to reciprocate.
By 1995 Japan will pass the
United , States in worldwide
computer sales; so predicts a
Commerce Department white
paper on the subject. An EPI
analysis predicts that maintain-
ing current hands—off policies
could lock the United States into
a technological decline that would
add $225 billion to the trade
deficit on an annual scale by the
year 2010 and could put 2 million
Americans out of work.
Therefore, it is our patriotic
duty to buy American! '

Soviets and U.S. ﬂying the friendly skies.

Francis Gary Powers was born
at the wrong time. ,

Powers, as you may or may not
know, was the American pilot
who was shot down in his U-2
reconnaissance plane over the
Soviet Union. This happened af-
ter then-President Dwight Eisen-
hower and General Secretary
Nikita Khrushchev had agreed to
ban these_types of ﬂights over
each other’s countries.

After a large, widely publicized
trial held in the Soviet Union,
Powers was convicted of espio-
nage and sent to a Soviet prison.
Later, he was traded to the West
for other high-ranking spies.

Now, President George Bush
has offered a plan to the Soviets
called the “open-skies policy." If
agreedon, the plan would open
the airspace above the United
States and the Soviet Union to
these reconnaissance ﬂights.

Unfortunately, the Soviets don't,

seem too receptive of the idea.
Since this incident occurred
back in the 1950s, both countries

have entered the space age. The
main reason: to spy on one an-
other. Both sides have long since
had satellites hovering thousands
of miles above the ‘planet, col-
lecting information for their re-
spective intelligence agencies.

Jeff
Tatusko

The Soviets lenowwe have these
satellites spying on them. We
/mow that the Soviets have their
satellites aimed at us. So why not
open up the areas in the lower
atmosphere and make things
easier for both sides?

Bush wants this plan for verifi-
cation of treaties like the recently
signed INF Treaty. The Soviets
feel that this would be an inva-
sion of their privacy. Why?

The KH-11 is one of our most
advanced satellite systems.
Though I don't know the actual
capabilities of it, I do know that

it is advanced enough to watch
01’ Gorby pick his nose if we so
desired.

Now the Soviets are worried
that, if we start sending our re-
connaissance planes over their
territory again, we'll start to learn
too much about what they actu-
ally have.

Verification is the major reason
why it takes so long for treaties to
be signed. Neither side wants to
open up its missile sites for in-
spection by a horde of enemy
intelligence-types, just searching
for any small violation of some
treaty. With the open-skies pol-
icy, honesty (gasp!) would be-
come the rule, and paranoia
would be tamed.

When he was shot down,
Powers was ﬂying in a U-2, a
plane (actually, a glider is more
correct) thatsailed over its target
and took pictures that were kind
of vague but could still detect
large objects like missile silos.
Today, we have the SR-71 Black-
bird. This jet can speed along at

four times the speed of sound
and can out-race almost anything
shot at it. It can also take detailed
pictures of a tin can from ap-
proximately 70,000 feet. And the
Soviets are worried that we will
learn too much.

Now, some people might worry 0'

about security. “What happens,”
they say, “if the Soviets launch an
air raid against us? What happens
to the policy then?” Well, rest
assured — our radar systems are
sophisticated enough to tell the
difference between one Soviet
spy plane and S0 Blackjack
bombers. Security won't be a
problem. (Of course, it might be

for the Soviets, who thought a

Mathias Rust was just some large
bird.)

The open-skies policy is the‘
first step toward building trust
between our two countries. Yet
the Soviets, with all their talk of
glasnost, or openness, are un-
willing to take that step. Well, it's
always nice to see that they
haven't lost all of their paranoia.

Heartbreak...

’ Night last night to ﬁnish the year

some quality defensive play,

Panthers lose to St.  

John's in final seconds

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

Whenjason Matthews streaked downcourt, the roles were reversed.
When Matthews freed the ball from a St. John’s defender, the roles
were reversed. As the game clock wound down to zero and Matthews
went up, released his shot and the announced crowd of 15,522
followed the arc of the ball with a singular eye, the roles were
reversed.

But the basketball teetered about the iron rim, rolled out and
Matthews fell to the ﬂoor. True identities were established once
again, and Greg “Boo” Harvey, he of the last—second heroics for the
Redmen game in and game out, was once again the prime force
behind a tight victory, this time a 76-75 win over Pitt at the Civic Arena
last night in a nationally televised game. _

-With the Panthers leading 73-72 with one minute remaining to play,
Pitt inbounded and senior forward Rod Brookin, playing in his last
“home” game, found himself in a one—on—one situation in front of the
St. John’s basket. Although the Panthers could have run the clock
down to nearly :15 without taking a shot, Brookin put the ball up,
missed and fouled Redmen center Robert Werdann with :39 remaining.

Werdann missed the front end of his one-and-one, but Panther

center Bobby Martin’s lane violation allowed Werdann an extra’

opportunity, and he hit both shots.
Brookin again found himself with the ball with :11 remaining, and
this time connected to lift the Panthers to a 75-74 lead.

But Harvey, the diminutive point guard who has taken control of

the Redmen since Jayson Williams’ season-ending injury on February

3, broke through Pitt’s full-court pressure defense and pulled up for

what would be the game-winning basket with just three seconds

coach Harry Parretta. “We hit the
shots early, and then we stopped
hitting them.”

The man-to—man strategy coach
Bruce implemented at the start
gave the Lady Panthers some
trouble.

“In th man-to-man, they were
setting a lot of picks, [when we

played in] the zone

place in the Big East
conference with a
record of 6-10.

Pitt's three seniors,
Rita Anderson, Lorri
Johnson, andjennifer
Shingler, were

 

it was easier for us
because they
weren’t setting a lot
of picks,” said Hurt.

Johnson said
the team felt more
comfortable in the

honored along with
their parents before
the game for their contributions
to Lady Panther basketball.

“I was a little shaken up before
the game,” said co-captain
Johnson. “But after I hit my first
shot I was alright.”

“It gave us a little more incentive
for us to win,” said Anderson.

Johnson and Shingler were Pitt’s
leading scorers with 24 and 18
points respectively. Johnson
added 19 rebounds and Shingler
grabbed seven.

Anderson totalled two points
and two rebounds and added

Villanova jumped to a 16-9
lead in the first eight minutes.

Coach Bruce called a time-out
to settle his players. Pitt then
came out playing more aggressive
and evened the score at 18 on a

with 8:56 left in the first half.

“We weren’t moving the ball
on offense, we got very stagnant,”
said Bruce. “There was no
emotion coming from anyone,
from the crowd or from the
players.”

Villanova was hitting outside
shots which put them in front
early.

Pitt abandoned their man-to-
man early and showed a variety

which is her normal role.
“Rita hit a clutch basket and
played good defense,”V said head

Maureen McConnell three-pointer

zone defense.

“We like that 1-
2-2 (full court press) that we
used, it’s better for us than a man-
to—man.”

Pitt and Villanova played even
for most of the game. But the
Lady Panthers pulled away just in
time to win.

Center Connie Hurt made a
lay-up with 5:12 to play to put Pitt
ahead for good. 5

Maureen McConnell made
another three-pointer with 1:39
left to give Pitt a 78-70 lead and
finish off the Lady Wildcats.

Pitt will open the Big East
tournament against third place

THE Pl'I'I' NEWS, Tuesday, February 27, 1990

By John Iabriola
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers gymnastics
team defeated the Bowling Green
State University Lady Falcons with
a lot of help from their bench.

“What can you say?” asked head
coach Debbie Yohman. “I have
the last of my bench out on the
ﬂoor; there is nobody else to put
out on the ﬂoor, and these guys
did as well as the strongest lineups
we’ve had out there. That’s
incredible.” 

Pitt’s problems began against
the University of Rhode Island
and James Madison University
two weekends ago, when Kim
Miller fell during her dismount
and injured her knee.

Yohman said that Miller tore a
ligament and will have surgery
on the first day of spring break.
She is expected to be out for the
rest of the season.

Last week, the Lady Panthers
received two more
disappointments when both Tina
Taylor and Shelly Sleith were
unable to practice. Yohman said
that Taylor went to have her knee
checked on Tuesday, only to
hear that it was a slight sprain she
received during Sunday's
competition.

Sleith was pulled from practice
because of her shoulders. “She
has shoulder problems, and
they’re trying to figure out what
the problem is,” said Yohman.
“She has just lost strength, and
she's not able to work out right
now."

The Lady Panthers are also
missing Jennifer Butkovich, who
is out of the lineup with
mononucleosis.

To replace both Miller and Sleith
in last Friday’s meet, Yohman put
Beth Dyson and Hope Celani in
the lineup.

Yohman said that on Thursday
of last week she had a talk with
the team members about their
morale.

“I just got real mad in practice,
at myself mostly, and I got real
hot, because we spent the week
being depressed because we had
lost people out of the lineup,”
said Yohman.

“And crying and [saying] ‘Pitt
just has such bad luck,’ and ‘blah
blah blah.’ And I told them, ‘You
guys just knock it off; that’s tough.
We still have a good team here;
this is the team we have to work
with. Get out and do the job. This
team that I’m going to put on the
ﬂoor tomorrow night can score
as high as what we’ve been
scoring. And if you don’t believe
that, then I'm not going to come
to the meet.’ Well they believed
it, and I came, and they did it."

Both Dyson and Celani turned
in strong bar performances, but
there were still a few errors.

“On bars I need a little more
work on my dismount," said
Celani.

The Lady Panthers went into
their beam routines with the same
enthusiasm as they always do.
Although the Lady Panthers did
experience a few falls, they were
able to hold themselves together
and break their high score of this
season on beam. Kristen Brown
broke the school’s beam record
of 9.55 by scoring a 9.65, while
Gina Venezia, who set the record
last month, tied her old score.
“The turn that Beth did and fell
off on was a very difficult turn; I’d
say that 50 percent of the time
you are going to fall off, and
there’s a point in the season where
you take that out if you’re falling
that much," said Yohman.

Even though the Lady Panthers
had some difficulties that they
had to adjust to, they were able to
pull out a 183.55, which is their
sixth-highest score on record.

It looked like the perfect ending
for senior night. Rod Brookin
appeared to hit the game winning
shot with 11 seconds left as he
and fellow seniors Pat Cavanaugh
and Gilbert Johnson were
completing their ﬁnal game in
front of the Pittsburgh fans. But
Redman ‘Boo Harvey’s jumper
with three seconds left ruined it.

Brookin’s shot appeared to be
a redemption for his earlier miss
on a questionable shot with 39
seconds to go. Although he did
feel he had an open shot, he
admitted it was one he probably
shouldn’t have taken.

“I did force the issue. Seniors
take shots like that,” said Brookin.

» “Being a senior I should know

better.” Brookin said he was not
thinking about it being his ﬁnal
home game towards the end.

Pitt Coach Paul Evans called
Brookin’s last minute shooting a
case of senior syndrome. He said
he went with the attitude that,
“It’s my last game and I’m going
to take the last shot.”

The night started off on a high
note for Brookin as his mother

Ethel escorted him to center court
for his senior presentation. The
senior from Steelton was
obviously feeling emotional for
the night ahead as he appeared
to be ﬁghting back tears as he
waved to the crowd..

After scoring only three points
in the first half Brookin took over

was also 2 for 5 on three pointers.

Free throws are an area which
could be Brookin’s largest
improvement this season. Coming
in to the year a career 68 percent
shooter, he entered the night at
83 percent, good for fourth in the
in the Big East. His career

 

in the second with 11 points.
With 7:38 remaining, he hit the
front end of a one-and-one,
making‘ him a member of Pitt’s
1000 point club and joining
teammates Jason Matthews and
Brian Shorter as this year’s
entrants.

Brookin ﬁnished with 14 points,
including 5 for 12 from the field
and 2 for 3 on free throws. He

average of 10.4 points per game
should see an increase as he
currently averages 12.7 points
per contest.

Brookin, always a fan favorite
for his hardnosed play and crowd
acknowledgement will probably
be best remembered by Pitt fans
for his role as the sixth man.
Many times when the Panthers

would get off to a slow start,
Evans would insert Brookin into
the game to provide a much
needed spark.

Although Brookin only started
22 out of his 91 games at Pitt he
often plays as many or more
minutes than some of the starters

and usually is a big factor in the
outcome. One of his most
memorable games was his career
high 24 points in Pitt’s victory
over third ranked Oklahoma on
January 15, 1989.

A Pitt fans will always remember
Brookin’s 15 points off the bench
in their dramatic double—overtime
victory against Boston College
on February 14, 1987; highlighted
by a shot from the corner sending

the game into it’s second extra

period.

Brookin, who is serving as co-
captain with Cavanaugh in his
ﬁnal season, ended the night with
an act of leadership. As a highly
dejected Matthews lay on the
court after missing his attempt for
the winning shot at the buzzer,
he helped him up and walked off
the court with him.

“Luck’s got a lot to do with it,”
said a smiling Harvey, whose
Redmen improved to 23-7 and
10-5 in the Big East on the strength
of his 20 points and Malik Sealy’s
22. “We don’t practice thatshot in
practice every day.”

The luck has run the other way
for the Panthers, whose record
dropped to 11-15, 5-10 in the
conference. “Jason’s last shot just
about typiﬁes how the season
has gone,” said Panther coach
Paul Evans.

Brian Shorter scored 24 points
and grabbed 13 rebounds for the
Panthers, while Brookin scored
14 to give him 1,003 for his career.

But the luster was peeled from
Brookin’s accomplishment by his
untimely play. “I did force the
issue. It was a terrible shot. Being
a senior, I shouldn’t take shots
like that,” he said. “It was just a
poor shot.”

But the game still wasn’t over
at that point. Not until Matthews,
who scored 14 points, fell face-
down on the hardwood in despair
after his missed shot, did the
Panthers quit.

“Anytime Jason shoots the ball,
I just know it’s going in,” said
Brookin. “He just got one of
those unlucky bounces there at
the end.”

“I thought it was going in,” said
Matthews.

The Panthers turned a 36-34
halftime lead
advantage with only three minutes
gone inthe second half, but St.
John’s Billy Singleton scored
seven points, Jason Buchanan
five and Sealy four to help the
Redmen to a 62-55 lead at 10:01.
The Panthers then went on a 14-
2 run to take a five-point, 69-64
lead with only 3:37 to play.

Sealy and the Panthers traded
three straight baskets before
Werdann gave the Redmen four
straight points and the 74-73 lead
at :39.

Shorter scored 16 points in the
ﬁrst half and Harvey ten for the
Redmen, who had an eight-point
lead, 18-10, at 11:40. Shorter,
Matthews and Martin combined
for 19 of Pitt’s next 26 points
before Harvey gave a preview of
things to come, shooting over
Darelle Porter with :15 left in the
half to reduce Pitt’s lead to two.

and Gilbert Johnson as well as
managers Rob Greenleaf, Dave
Schwartzberg and Derrick Vent
