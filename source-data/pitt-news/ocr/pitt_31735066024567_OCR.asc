The University Retention Com-

into practice its analysis of many of

. the reasons students drop’ out of the

university, according (to Associate
Provost Robert Nossen, chairper-
son of the Committee.-

“We’re not witch—hu‘ntin_g,”-said
Nossen. “We’re looking for facts.
We’re concerned about every abuse.

“You can’t dismantle Forbes Quad
now," saidiia ‘graduate’ student in‘
Political Science here recently, “but
that is essentially what Reagan is
asking us to do."'

He was referring to the growing
fear within the university over Rea-
gan’s budget proposals for student
aid. ’ C

If Rea‘gan’s cuts go through, it will
mean reductions and restrictions in
nearly all financial aid, including
basic grants, guaranteed student
loans, subsidies for the health pro-
fessions, libraries, research pro-
grams; teaching. assistants, and
social security benefits to students.

Concern is foremost over the‘

changes in GSLS and Pell
'formerly_1BEOG. . -. \
Under the 'R'ea_gan ’proposals,

Grants,

~ loans would be paid only to those

who can demonstrate “need,” and
then the amount would be limited to
“remaining ne.ed”+educatio'nal
costs minus other aid plus expected
family contribution. ,. i ' 0
Under the present system, any
undergraduate can borrow up to
$2,500 per year.
‘ Currently, 10,000 Pitt students
receive guaranteed loans in egccess of

"352: million. ~ '

DanielvMay, Pi_tt’s director of

 

‘past five years. _ f ,

“Although numerous ‘reasons’
have been offered, there is at concen-
sus that~"rarely does a student drop

out for any single reason; it is’ an"
_ accumulation and combination of

factors," says the report. , , .

administrators, faculty, staff '. and

‘students, consists of seven task'for— ‘

Can television networks survive

the coming technological onslaught? {

According to Herb Stein, contri-
buting editor to Pittsburgh Maga-
’ zine, the answer is no. Speaking at
an honors program lecture “TV: is
There Life After Technology‘?,"
Stein said the networks have the
world to themselves, but “soon,
something will take their place.“

That “something," according to
Stein, is cable TV. Not the kind that
exists in the towns outside of Pitts-
burgh, but a totally different kind,

soon install in the city.

Warner will offer some 60 chan-
nels to Pittsburgh viewers via a “tier
system." Subscribers will be able to
pick from among five different levels
of programming, ranging from tier

‘one, the economy "package, to tier -

five, the most elaborate.

Tier one will offer all local chan-
nels plus Home Box Office -and
news, sports, and weather supple-
ments, while tier five features
QUBE, which allows for viewer
feedback on programming through
a pushbutton_ box. Stein called it
“interactive television.”

Costs of the specialized program-
ming, “narrowcasting,” range from

      Can TV- Survive the Cable Onslaught?

the kind that- Warner. Cable will i

tier one‘s $6 monthly fee to tier five’s
charge of $25. Special‘ programming
could also be obtained for an addi-
tional charge.

Stein warned that there are some
“problems and dangers" with cable
systems, one of which is privacy.

» “Will they (cable system operators) »_

keep all the information they could
collect? And if they do_, how would:
theyuse it?” '

Another problem Stein menti-
oned .was corruption. “Cable TV
does not have'a good reputation."

_He cited the fact that several law- ;

suits have been brought against_
Warner for illegal activities in
attempts to secureadditionale
franchises. ' '

would have “significant harm" on
middle income students. He charged
that Reagan's changes in Title IV of
the education act—middle income
assistance—would make the act self-
defeating.

Reagan's changes in basic grant
eligibility would require families to
contribute 20 percent of their “dis-
cretionary income”’ income
remaining after essential bills have
been paid, and students to contrib-
ute $750 towards theireducation.

Also being pushed is an eligibility
ceiling of $30,000 for aid.

A Tronzo said, “with inflation, even
those families won‘t be able to pay."

 

In other areas of financial assist-
ance the “New Beginning" proposes
to:

*. End subsidies to the health
professions.

* Reduce or eliminate some pro-
grams ofthe National Science Foun-
dation, affecting research programs
and science and engineering
education. '

* Reduce funding for arts and
humanities endowments, affecting
libraries, teaching assistants and
teaching fellows.

booth devised by the campus police,
highlighted last year‘s festival. The

_»stage show included pantomimes,

‘sing-a-longs, magic acts and clowns.
‘-‘lt’s like going to the circus," for
handicapped children, Snyder said.
Booths are “the kind you’d find at
any penny carnival,” he added.

The festival gives Pitt students a
chance to interact with those less
fortunate in the community, he said.

“Interacting with anyone who is
disabled is not a mainline thing. It is
difficult to know how to talk to
somebody, to understand them,"
Snyder said.

A total of 1,500 Pitt students are
expected to participate in some way;
500 in a one-on-one relationship
with the children, and others in sup-
port roles such as booth construc-
tion and food preparation.

During the 1979 and 1980 festi-
vals, booths were sponsored by
members of resident halls, nurses,

_ student» organizations, academic

groups, honoraries and administra-
tive offices such as the campus
police. _ I’

“Whatever group wants to do a
booth, can." Snyder said.

Institutions housing handicapped
children have debated what is best
for their people, specifically their

interaction with others and their
relationship with society, he said.

Some, especially thosewvho release
their clients on weekends, have been
reluctant to participate.

“Thev don‘t want their kids to be
used. You don’t want to use any-
body. You don‘t want to usethe kids
for thevUniversity of Pittsburgh to
get offsome oftheir frustrations,” he
said. “There’s some of that is
society,”,he added.

’ But those conditions have not
existed at the Hand-in-Hand Festi-
val, which has an excellent reputa-
tion for providing the handicapped a
pleasant afternoon filled with enter-
tainment, Snyder said. '

study resulted in the following
findings: _

"88 percent have had a class can-
celled. or the instructor didn’t show
up, at least once;

“52 ‘percent have had at least one
instructor who did not adequately

The task force also evaluated a

Students usually attribute this.

concern for their own research or

regular faculty members are said to
appear disdainful of Pitt undergrad-

Tlie CGS Study also cites poor
‘teaching skills: “Students perceive
some faculty members, while pre-
sumably being highly knowledgea-
ble in their fields. to be grossly inept
in their teaching techniques, to be
unable to explain matters articu-

when they do not have a foreign
accent that is difficult to decipher.-
There is, some students say, almost a
disdain for instructional
methodology.“

be devoted exclusively to student
conferences; a maximum number of"

The report recommends interac-

“Students so involved will more
likely greet and ‘relate to each other

The report encourages better
information access and meeting pla-
ces, and proposes “a concerted effort
to get students involved invarious

L t Questions

_The Student Government Board has begun their
allocation process. But there seems to be a- question
concerning the university policy used in distributing '.
the dollars to the student organizations. C ‘

Organizations are not required to provide any spe-
cifics regarding’ the size'or the student support their
organization receives. To qual'ify for’ part of thestu-
dent activity fee, a‘ group must only assert thatjt has at
least 25 members, and that 75 percent of‘ those

members" are undergraduates. This assertion 'of'rnern- L ,
’ bership need not be pro.Ven, so the«orga_nizations.app- “

lying for fundsneed only tostate it to be eligible for .

allocations.

The fairness in question here recently arose when
the SGB began considering the status of-t_he_lnterna-
tional Committee Against Racism (lnCAR). The
membership in- the organization is hardlydefined,
since their constitution states that “Any student,
faculty member’ or employee who agrees with‘...the

purposes-' of Pitt lnCAR

organization.”

can be a memberof this

' This is a rather broad ‘membership requirement, and
other reports from lnCAR conc/erningxthe size of the

I organization have been inconsistent.

It would be difficult to allocate money to an organi-
zation without a knowle\dge.of its size or its usefulness.
Arising from this questionof difficulty is alsoa ques— .

,_ ‘ tion of fairness. With larger, more established organ_i..— 3-"
7 ' -zations, it should ‘not be a problem determiningttheir _
" needs for the coming year. But -for the newer, smaller
ones, how many may get short-changed because off-

inaccurate information or inter'pretation?_.How many
organizations not deservipg of the money theygreceive A

will ‘take a slice from the pic of others. » -

legitimacy. The student activity money i_s‘.'there_;-the

Greek Notes

By o/{N SAINT

This coming Saturday evening,
March 21, is perhaps the most
important night of the year for the
Greeks. For this is the night ofGreek
Sing, and the beginning of Greek
Week. Weeks of practice, sweat, sac-
rifice and neglect of evening classes
will end, as the Greeks perform their
polished acts’ front of the many
spectators at Carnegie Music Hall.
This.year‘s show promises to be one
of the finest ever. '

More time is spent in preparation -

.for Greek Sing, a mere six minute
production, than in any other indi-
vidual event. More emotion and
passion is shown in Greek Sing than
in anything else. This is where the

Greeks -become” serious about,

competition. . K .
There is-a great deal of specula-
tion concerning this year’s show. A

gentleman from FIJI stated that first i

Pantherette iswimmersiand diver compete at Nationals

Jackson, Pantherettes Shoot for More Honors H

   .. as

‘The Pantherette swim team continues its competition at the National Championships at
South Carolina today through Saturday. The Pantherettes qualified a team-record nine
swimmers and one diver for the meet. ' '

By SEAN BARNES

Pitt News Sports Writer

Pitt Pantherette Amy Jackson
gained her sixth career All-Am_”erica
honor, and first this year, as she fin-

ished seventh in the nation in the

l00-yard butterﬂy at AlAW Cham-
pionship preliminaries at South
Carolina yesterday. The finish pro-
pelled Jackson into the finals, which
were held last_ night. Coach Dick
Bradshaw said he expected Jackson,
the Eastern record,-holder in the 100
butterfly, to place even higher in the
finals. '

Jackson, who qualified in the 50-
and I00-yard butterfly as well as the
50- and I00-yard freestyle, missed
placing in the 50-yard butterfly yes-
terday, but her two freestyle events
have yet to come. Swimming with-
Jackson in the freestyle will be’
another former. Pantherette All-
America, Jan Ujevich.

Ujevich, qualified in eight individ-
ual events, is Pitt’s strongest hope
besides Jackson to gain ‘All-America
status. Ujevich recently broke four
Eastern records at the EAIA Cham-
pionships at Pitt, and as only a
sophomore, she codld break more

Eastern ‘records and possibly
National records if her career con-
tinues its amazing pace. -Ujevich will
swim her individual events and her
relays today and tomorrow.
Bradshaw is waiting for finals
tonight and tomorrow, when Pitt's
400- and 800-yard freestyle relays
will swim. The 400-yardrelay has a
good chance of placing within the
top eight teams in the nation. The
relay was ranked eleventh during the
regluar season. The 800-yard frees-
tyle relay team was ranked No. 2 in
the country, and with swimmers

Jackson, Linda Frankenbach, Sue»

Heon, and Ujevich. Pitt will go for it

all tomorrow night.

Also tomorrow will be the diving
finals in which‘Pitt’s Julie DeHaven
is the only Eastern diver to qualify.
Saturday night will conclude four
long days ofchampionships with the
top girls in the nation competing for
No. I both individually and as a
team. Pitt has had an excellent regu-
lar‘ season preceding nationals, and
the team hopes to extend its success
at the Championships. The Pan-
therettes have qualified ‘the most
girls ever, in the most events ever,
under coach Bradshaw this year.

By ANNA ARLOTTA 

Pitt News Sports Writer

If someone had asked Panther
spiker Gary Groshner a question
about volleyball five years ago, he
would have shrugged his shoulders
and said, “I don’t know." Nowthe
shoe seems to be on the other foot.
Pitt‘s volleyball opponents are the
ones shaking their heads about
Groshner and the Panthers and say-
ing, “I don’t know.” This time, the

_question being asked. is, “How do

you contain Groshner out on the
court?" Many teams have yet to find
the answer, and they never will, if
the Panthers-have anything to do
about it. '

Freshman standout‘ Groshner
came to Pitt from Maplewood High,
a lmall northern Pennsylvania
school. He was a much sought-after
athlete last year, and not only in the
sport of volleyball. In high school,
he lettered in four sports--baseball,
hasketball, golf and volleyball. He
combined two ofthe sports, baseball
and volleyball,~in one season. A typi-

_ cal day of high school practice in the

spring consisted of baseball from
3:30-6 p.m., and volleyball practice
from 7-9 p.m.

Groshner had been heavily recru-
ited both in state and out. One ofthe
schools that recruited Groshner was
the University of Cincinnati, which,
through a stroke ofluck, is what sent
Groshner to Pitt head coach Ray
Reilly and the Panthers.

“l was recruiting at the PIAA
state championships in Shippens-
burg last year," said Reilly, “when
the coach from Cincinnati came up
to me and told me about this young
man who he had been trying to
recruit for his team. Gary had made"
the decision not to attend Cincy‘
because of financial reasons, being
an out-of-state student.

“The Cincy,_coach told, me that if
he wasn't able to get Gary to play for

()pponents nowThere’s o topping Groshner

his team then he didn’t even want’
him in the state ofOhio. That way he
wouldn't have to . face him in
competition.” ‘ V

“A gift“ to the Panthers is how
Reilly labels Groshner. Andwhat a
gift he hasyturned out to be. His
teammates already consider him one

‘ of the top freshmen in Eastern men's
. volleyball.

r

“He has really good fundamental
ability," said Danny O’Donnell,
“enough that I would think that he is
probably.one ofthe best freshmen in

the East. I remember playing against 1

him in high school tournaments. He
was outstanding_——a good all-
around athlete."

, After layingfor one season in
junior high, Groshner quit the vol-

‘ ,-leyball team because he hated the

sport. Fortunately for the Panthers,
there was someone there who took
the time to encourage him to play
‘again. i -

“After-one year I quitrbecause I
hated it, I just wasn’t interested,”_
said_ — Groshner. -.‘‘But. my coach,
George Schroeder, kept me into it
and got me to play the next season. I
didn’t know what the game was until
I started playing for Coach

Schroeder; ‘I give him the credit for 4

teaching me the fundamentals of the
sport. We had him as a coach until I
was a high school junior.i‘That‘s the '
year we took second place in.;tr|ve
PIAA state championships.” ’ A

That season, the first time in_ l5
years that Maplewood went to the
state championships, found
Groshner ‘being named to the
second-team .All-PIAA squad.‘ A

“year” later his team didn’t make it out

of the double elimination round of

States, but Gfoshner was named to?

the first team All-PlAA squad. 1

The Pitt Panther basketball sea-
son is over, and now it’s time for the
report card.

CARLTON NEVERSON B
plus

Neverson gets an ‘A for defense, but
his offensive performances were
inconsistent. The senior from New
York tended to get too much out of
control sometimes, especially on fast
breaks, but his play at the point on
defense was invaluable.

 

SAM CLANCY A

What else? Did everything wel1—
rebounded, played defense, scored
and provided much-needed leader-
ship. His shooting touch has greatly
improved, which may help him in
the pro draft’. It will be a long time
before Pitt gets another player of his
caliber. In the clutch, give Sam the
ball. a

DARRELL GISSENDANNER
B

Last five games helped him out a
great deal. Hungriest and quickest’
player on the team. Playing time"
gave him confidence, and his tur-
novers decreased quite a bit. Strong
candidate for a startingjob if he can
keep himself under control on the
ﬂoon

LENNIE MCMILLIAN A
minus

The most valuable man on defense.
His quick hands and reﬂexes made
the defense jell during mid-season.
Most of his points came off his play
on defense. Didn’t get an A because
of his shooting, which was not great.
McMillian did commit some over-

zealous fols '

 

CLYDE VAUGHN B
Best pure scorer on the team. Can
shoot with anybody. Still has to
learn to put the ball on the floor and
must acquire some quickness. With
improvement, he could be team’s
leading scorer next year.

PAUL BROZOVICH ,B minus
Most improved player. Not afraid to
put the ball on the floor and take it
to the hoop. Needs to develop a
shooting touch and to concentrate
on getting some defensive position.
His knack for foul trouble was often
becauserhe was caught out of posi-

tion too many times.

Has good tools. Intelligent, fluid,

' vault into'the starting line-up. Has

to put on.some weight and learn to
play better defense. Not afraid to
throw his body around, but with
extra poundage, he could be more

very good, but his shooting touch is
inconsistent. A consistent shooting

Of all centers, Scheuermann gets the

while in the back row and hit when
in the front row. Upon coming to
the Panthers this past fall; Groshner
became an outside hitter. He broke
into a solid lineup of young. expe-
rienced Panther spikers that had
only two players. captain Jeff Beav-
ers, and hitter Don Hardin. depart
from the Division II title team.

“We have a young team, but eve-
ryone has .a tremendous volleyball
background." said Reilly. “Western
Pennsylvania is one of the better
areas in the country ‘for men’s
volleyball." '

There was a need for outside hit-
ters coming into the Panthers’ first
season of play in Division I of the
Eastern Volleyball‘ Collegiae
League. So Reilly took this “gift” of
his and shared it with his team.

“He earned the position from day
one," said Reilly. “He was funda-
mentally sound when he got here, so
he didn‘t need much work. He has a
36-inch vertical leap.

“I think that we have one of the
strongest outside hitters iii the East
in Gary. Sure he makes some fresh-
man mistakes, but they are nothing
that can’t be overcome in a year.
He’s dominating even with those
mistakes.“

“He has good potential," said
teammate and captain Dave Baird.
“He needs more experience reading
blocks, but once he learns that, I
think that he is going to surface as an
unstoppable power hitter.”

Groshner visited Pitt only three
weeks before the team started last

fall. Besides volleyball. everything
that he was exposed to was very dif-
ferent from what he had been used to
in the past. Groshner comes from a
small country area near Meadville.
Pittsburgh loomed ahead as a big
change.

“Pitt turned out to be a good
place," said Groshner. “Everything
is so different than the country that I
had been used to; it’s all so fast-
paced. It was a late decision to come
to Pitt but I‘m happythat I madethe
right choice. I‘ve been able to see
some of the other schools that I was
thinking of going to, and I made the
right choice to come and play for
Pitt.”

Groshner and the Panthers will be
facing one of their toughest oppo-
nents this season Monday night
when the Penn State Nittany Lions,
No.2 in the East, come to‘ visit for a
league match. A win for No. 3 Pitt
could very well mean a giant stepup
the ladder of Division I ECVL play.

“We got killed by Rutgers last Fri-
day, then we had a very important
meeting that produced a whole new
team when we played in the ECVL
tournament last Saturday." siad
Groshner. “What happened in the
first half of the year was immaterial,
if the way we played to win that
tournament holds up. We’ll be tough
against the remainder of our
opposition."

That opposition includes Penn
State on Monday night. The best-of-
five match has now been moved to
the Field House and ‘will begin at 7
p.m

pikers Briefs

You ’re Invited. . .

The Pitt Pantherette basketball
team has been invited to play in the
National Women’s Invitational
Tournament (NWIT). Pitt (20-7)
will face Georgia (24-I0) in Ama-
rillo, Texas on Thursday, March
25th. ‘

Three Pantherettes have been
selected as nominees for balloting on
the
America Ballot.‘ They are sopho-
more forward Pam Miklasevich.
junior point guard Debbie “Day”
Lewis. and junior center Gail
Aughburns. V

The NWIT bid gave the Pan-
therettes a second chance in post-
season play this year. Pitt dropped
its first playoff game in the opening
round of the EAIAW Regional
Championships to No. 4 Rutgers,
9l-80. two weeks ago at Piscataway.

The Kirby Derby. . .

A report that" Pitt basketball
recruit Roosevelt Kirby is reconsid-
ering attending Pitt is “inaccurate”
according to Pitt sports information
director Dean Billick.

‘The story, which first appeared in
the Beaver County Times, reported
that Kirby, a 6-foot 8 forward and
junior college All-American, had
made only a “verbal commitment”
to attend Pitt and has not signed an
Eastern 8 letter of intent.

Billick denied the report.

“Kirby did sign an Eastern 8 letter
of intent, and to the best of our
knowledge, he will be attending
Pitt,” Billick said yesterday. “Coach
(Roy) Chipman spoke to him two
days ago and nothing is changed.”
