Sickness isn‘t a thing to look
forward to, but in the event of ill-
ness. you may need some of the
following information.

The University Health Center.
located on the main floor of
Brackenridge Hall, is the best
place for students to go for medi-
cal care. -By subscribing to the
University Medical Insurance

Plan, almost all bills will be cov- V

ered by Blue Cross-Blue Shield-
Major Medical. On an out-pa-
tient basis, 80 per cent of medical
bills incurred will be paid‘ by

K ‘/-the insurance.
\ _.

-4.

K
\

From experience, one can’t
stress enough that the $56.16 for
the cost of the insurance is the
wisest way for a student to se-
cure good medical; care at low
cost. No other place in the City-
offers this service plus the con-
venience of being located on the
campus.

The Health Center offers ap-
pointments with general practi-
cioners, gynecologists, psychia-
trists, internists. dermatologists.
surgeons and orthopedic surgeons.

Students who do not subscribe
to the Health Service may use
their facilities, however, they will
be charged at cost. Consultation

, with a nurse on duty is done for
" free.

The Pittsburgh Free Clinic no
longer encourages students to
use their facilities located in
Shadyside, because the operation
is currently treating patients to
their capacity.

Falk Clinic. on Fifth Ave., next
to Children’s Hospital. provides
low cost health care with physi-
cians from the University com-
munity. However. be advised that
waiting lines are long.

Oakland Shopping: Beware

by CHRIS CIEPLY

It's not easy being a shopper.
Especially in the Oakland area.

If you still wonder why your
mommy always comes home
from a shopping trip with a few
more furrows in her brow. stop
wondering. As a student on your
own in Oakland. providing‘your-
self with life‘s’ necessities means
learning the shopping game.

Unlike mommy, ‘who may be
able to drive to the best bargains
in _town, you can only shop, prac-

tically speaking, in places within‘

walking distance of your resi-
dence, be it house,dorm, or what-
ever. Paying bus fare to shop in
another part of town defeats the
purpose (saving money) and hik-
ing or hitching there is taking the

risk that your milk will be sour"

and your beef will turn brown by
the time you get back home.‘

The best /you. can do. then. is
to find the lowest prices within
the area.

First of all. no matter how your
parents may lament the passing of
the neighborhood corner store. it
is an economic fact that chain
storesdo provide a greater selec-
tion of items at the same or lower

Eating in Pittsburgh

Szabo Cot

- by RITA VITOLO

Eating is a biological necessi-
ty; eating cheaply, but well. is of-
ten an economic necessity. Des-
cribed below are several Oak-
land area restaurants that don't
serve Szabo hamburgers, yet still
manage to return more than
change for a game of pinball.

Weinstein’s in Squirrel Hill is- a
family-style restaurant whose
strongest appeal is good food
served in a quiet atmosphere.
The cheesecake (95C‘l is claimed
to be the best in Pittsburgh. and

- is one of a large selection of des-
. serts. —*' ‘

The luncheon menu ranges from
corned beef ($1.33) to kosher
weiners (95¢) to meat borscht
with sour cream (50¢).

Canter‘s. a restaurant that
serves the same kind of food at
similar prices. is located in Oak-
land on Atwood St.

On the other hand. a wide va-
riety of pancakes. sausages. and
omelets is the specialty of Pan-
cake Kitchen. Eggs and bacon.

cost. Here‘s one example: Skip-
py Peanut Butter at the Modern
Food Market on Atwood St. cost
630 for a 12-02. jar and 890 for 18-
oz. Skippy was the only brand the
small market carried.

Comparing prices at Oakland’s
two major food markets reveals
few surprises. Going back to the
peanut butter, the cost for all
name brands at both stores was
the same: 49¢ for 12-oz., 69¢ for

18-02. and $1.05 for 28-oz. Chain .

brands, it should be noted, were
far cheaper. Ann Page (A&P)‘ and_
Food Cub (Giant Eagle) peanut
butter were 47¢ for 12-oz., 99¢
for 28-oz., and for 18-oz.,'Food
Coub was 65¢ and Ann Page 66¢.

A comparison of the cost of 12
types of Campbell's soups show-
ed prices the same at both stores
for six types: tomato. bean and
bacon. vegetable, chicken noodle.

Drinking Around Pitt:

Answer to

by JOHN SMITH

The bar scene in Oakland is as
diversified as the various groups
that frequent these bars. Stu-
dents. old men. ethnic groups and
young sophisticates will have no
trouble finding a watering-hole
that suits their particular needs.

Before I go into specifics. let
me preface this article with a
couple of helpful hints. First. for
you out-of-staters. the drinking
age here is 21. Although some of
the salons I mention will serve
anyone who can carry his money
to the bar. cards should be handy
at all times. Some places require
one.card .wiath,:age,pl’us_some other;

Pedantry

ID. Second. the bars all close at
2 a.m. every night of the week.
So. make sure you allow yourself
plentylof time to get tanked be-
fore last call.

This does not pretend to be -a

‘complete listing of all the, bars in

the area. Rather, those that will
appeal most to the college set as
far as price range and atmosphere
Now, with these preliminaries out
of the way, let’s sample what the
vicinity has to offer in the way of
liquid refreshments.

Starting in lower Oakland. Sam

chicken rice, and cream of mush-

pancy was for Chicken and Stars,
which cost 22¢ at A&P and 17¢
at Giant Eagle-. A close second
was chicken gumbo, 17¢ at A&+
and 21¢ at Giant Eagle.

the way it's packaged. Both stores
sold butter in a one-pound block
for 73¢, but wrapped in quarter

You don't need to shop around

But watch for packaging here, too,-

Located near the Pitt campus is
the Carnegielnstitute which main-
tains a Film Section curated by
Sally Dixon._

The film section began in 1970
and operates on grants from
four sources, according to Dixon.

On Sunday evenings the Film
Section offers a History of Film
series.'free to the public. in the
Lecture Hall behind Carnegie‘

‘ Library.

Starting in September this ser-

' ies will feature silent classics by

George Melies. Edwin S. Porter.
and D. W. Griffith and later pre-

sent more recent films such as

The Golem,' Variety, Zero for
Conduct, G‘oddard‘s Breathless,
and Bunuel's El Nazarin.

Another program sponsored by
the Film". Section is the Inde-
pendent Filmmakers series which
features a well-known -filmmaker
who screens his films and then

discusses them with the audience ,

afterwards. There is a $1.50 stu-

dent admission’ charge for each‘

program in. this series. Stan Brak-
hage and Jonas Mekas are two
filmmakers to be featured in the
fall series, according to Dixon.

 The Film section also sponsors
-a directors series. .which is an

"in depth. retrospectiveilook at‘

the films of one director." This
fall. Danish director. Carl Dreyer.
will be the subject of the pro-
gram. Admission is also $1.50
perfilm. _ .
Dixon said the Film Section
will also sponsor a mini-course
by famous filmmakers at the

Pittsbtggh Filmmakers Coopera-

tive in East Liberty. This pro-
include an editing
course by Bruce" Connors. a ‘cre-
ative visual course by Stan Brak-
hage. and an animation course
by Bob>Breer. . .
' Schultz maintained that film
deserves serious academic study.

depth and complexity as the other

art forms. Jean Renoir’s fi_lms are .

Black Action Society -

BAS Explains Emphasis

by WILLIAM KILSON
As a black student organization; the Black Action Society has taken
a new approach to its roles and functions in relation to the University
community.

Crisis orientation and force tactics are not useful today. Instead,
we’ve adopted a threefold emphasis: making an effective input into
the planning and decision-making processes of the University in the
interest of black students, improving and increasing the social, cul-
tural, and academic programming for black students, and solidifying
the black.student’s black community relationship.

In order to accomplish these things we need the imput of each
and every black student at Pitt. We need to know what you think is
wrong—or what is right. We want to hear about what yourproblems
are, and your needs, and youriinterests. That‘s what we've about.
First and foremost, we want to be a service organization for _vou. the

 gAn evaluation ofgthe Oakland security situation

Many students who come to
Pitt are either coming to a big
city for the first time or coming

{ 7 ‘to a new big city. Those who come
"W~from other cities know what to
i ‘expect but not where; those who
.. -come’ to the city from a smaller
  7 town often don‘t know what to ex-
 pect. -

‘ One must face the realityvof

' Pitt's identity as an urban uni-
students‘
- learn to lock their doors at all
f times and many come to avoid

Oakland streets at night. Although

versity. While here.

it is better to go out in the com-

‘ pany of others. there are those

times when one finds himself
walking somewhere late at night
and alone. The Pitt News has
compiled an evaluation of the
relative safety of walking the var-
ious streets in Oakland at night.

‘ While many students will never

have a problem during their stay

L in Oakland. it  hoped that this

evaluation will help all the stu-
dents who will make Oakland
home for the next four years.

Several things to keep in mind
to make your stay a memorable
one ,are: 1) Always lock your
house and car when in.Oakland;
2) Try to walk with friends when
walking at night; 3) And if your‘
must walk alone, keep on the

streets that are well lit, and 4) .

Enjoy your stay in Oakland!
* * *

The following analysis of the
incidence of crime in the Oakland
area was compiled in collabora-
tion with the officers of No. 4 Po-
lice Station.

Halkat St.—Magee Hospital: local
residential; relatively safe for
walking except late at night; not
well lit. .

Coltart St.-—A&P; local residen-
tial; fair lighting; fairly safe.

T Reckoning with the Realities of

idential housing; small shop-
ping district at Bates; fairly
safe walking to Bates; stay in a
group after Bates to Dawson.

Meyran Ave.——Student and local
residential; fairly safe most
times.

Oakland—Forbes to Bates: fairly
safe most of the time; women
should expect some verbal har-
assment between Forbes and
Fifth and just below Forbes:
some dark spots close to Bates:
student and local residential.

Bouquet St.—Fairly safe walking:
women can expect verbal har-
assment near Forbes due to all
the bars.

Ward St.—Some student housing;
no place to take a liesurely eve-
ning stroll. In

Dawson—Mixed residential; good
housing; poor housing; fairly
safe walking; some burglaries.

bar and booths.

Moving up to Forbes Ave., the
first place of note is Sunny Daye’s
Stage Door. This one features a
good jazz ensemble on weekends
and one day a week. The atmos-
phere here is lounge-like, and
mixed drinks seem more in order
than pitchers of beer. Eric Kloss,
world renowned saxaponist is of-
ten featured on Wednesday, Fri-

Serving the immediate towers
area are Wolfarth’s and the Wood-
en Keg. Tight security in the eve-
nings makes these two virtually

inaccessible to the cardless. Wol- _

farth's is more stand-up with a
bar and few tables jammed along
one wall and corner. The crowd
is almost pure freak-student. es-
pecially in the fall and winter.
There was a rumor that the gay
clientelle is increasing there, but
it seemed to me that the crowd
was still mainly hetero with plen-
ty of straight cruising. Good pin-

,3 .5“. balls, good beer and in the after-

noons, pretty good food. However.
the bathroom is downright repul-
sive.

The Keg is much the same story,
only from what -I've seen, less
freaks and more of the secretary
fraternity group. Seating fairly
plentiful, and food served at night.
Porky Chedwick (a leftover DJ
from thei50s) spins platters for
dancers on weekends.

gay with a few straights wander-
ing in and out occasionally: Beer
here is $1.50 a pitcher. Cruising
is on the up and up. The bar is fair-
ly big, but other seating is atro-
cious—everyone seems to prefer
leaning against one of the walls.
The juke is also outrageous. fe-
male torch singers are the big

hit. A must for gays. but I would

think that straight people could
find better.

Veering from our course on
Forbes. we move eastward to
Center Ave. There are three bars
worth a visit, whenever. in this
area.

Chief’s is another well-lit hang-
out. Although it caters mainly to
the old man set, the cozy booths,
cheap, cold drafts, general quiet
makes this a nice place to go
on a week night for a chat with
the boys. I say boys because it
could be classified as masculine.

The Luna, corner of‘ Craig and
Center, is another one ‘of those
lively student places. similar to
Wolfarth‘s. '

Further up center is the Had-
don Hall. This establishment bor-
ders on the classy, and is not the
best place to swill beer and raise
hell. Again, it is more of the mix-
ed-drink, lounge atmosphere. It's
the kind of place you'd take a date.
maybe before or after a show or
some other event.

If you care to make a trip to

Squirrel Hill. drop by the Squirrel

Hill Cafe. This is one of those old-
er folks bars. but is fast becom-
ing a popular hang-out for CMU
and Pitt students. It‘s not the
riotous good—time place. but once
again, the quiet beer with the
gang. (Not as masculine in tem-
perment as Chiefs.) Located on
Forbes Ave.. a little past Murray
Ave. '

Last but not least is Walshe’s.

This is an Irish pub in East Lib-
erty, whose claim to fame is the
performance of Bluegrass Mu-
sic on the weekends. It’s become
high on the list of Friday night
activities for several people I

-have spoken to.

Thus ends the list of bars I have
known and gotten drunk in. But
since I haven‘t included all the
bars around, I'll give brief men-
tion to some which I have never
gone to. but which they tell me
are worth the space.

Pink Panther—Jock bar located
on Oakland Ave.» I

Craig St. Inn—Straight young
exec, secretary set.

The Original Hot Dog Shop —
Notable for its beer on Sundays.

U-CEP Seeks Input

by TERRI A. SEAMON

For the past‘? four months, students of the University—Community
Education Program, a program oriented toward preparing disadvan-
taged students for college work. have been meeting with U-CEP ad-
ministrators concerning the lack of motivation among its students, as
well as the communication gaps throughout the entire program. Dur-
ing these meetings questions were raised as to the ability of the U-CEP
department to deal with and reflect the ideas of its students.

At present. due to the increased numbers of students in the pro- .

gram, it has not been able to adequately cope with the problems of
minority students. There is a lack of incentive on the students part.
exemplified in boredom and poor performance.

The only unifying factor of the program is that every student is
required to take the same courses, which are often repetitions of ma-
terials taught in high school. -

We, the students. realize the need to strength basic skills so that

. good performance and graduation from the University can be assured.

However, it is our opinion that if U-CEP students could be brought

together under a Student Government many problems might be solved.

We look to the incoming freshmen for their support and for innova-
tive ideas.

Change the World

Ralph Nader, long-time defender
of the consumer and the citizen, has
developed a new force for dealing
with the 70’s. This force is the Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG).
PIRGS are now deployed across the.
country, from Oregon to Florida.

But a PIRG is not just any kind
of group dealing with research in the
public interest. A_ PIRG is speciﬁc-
ally a student group on the college
level, andiit is a chartered corpora-
tion with contingents at several
schools. And, of course, they are form-
ed with the help‘ of Nader’s Washing-
ton headquarters, although they are
each independent. »

- The typical PIRG raises funds from
a retumable fee on the academic in-
voice of participating schools. The fee
(around ‘$2 a term) is used to a pro-
fessional H.Q. and field staff which
works with student volunteers on
problems such as:

o CONSUMER PROTECTION

0 ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
o SEXISM AND RACISM

0 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
o STUDENT RIGHTS

A PIRG is completely under stu-
dent command-—the Board of Direc-
tors on each campus is elected by the
members.

are brought in to discuss‘ social
issues revolving around homo-
sexuality.

Past activities of the organiza-
tion have included a statewide
convention. Gay Pride Week. and
the maintaining and staffing of
the Persad Center in Shadyside.
which is a mental health center
for sexual minorities.

One of the main goals of the or-
ganization is to try and educate
the different levels of society on
homosexuality.

Other gay groups in the'Pitts-g
burgh area are Gay Students at
Pitt and the Lesbian/Feminists
Association.

Environmental,

Back in the 1960's. Americans
finally realized that they were
killing themselves.$a '

Polluted skies. waterways filled
with industrial waste. and many
areas fast becoming wasteland.
the death of bires, animals. and

‘fish were the_result of years of

an ignorance and neglect which
threatened the existence of man.

Now in the l970’s, ecology is
more than just a fad issue, it has

‘ evolved into" a very serious cru-

sade. Environmentalists have be-

‘come more in demand, people

have become more aware of their
environment and most important,
industry and business have begun
to slowly understand the necessity
for environmental control. ' * ‘

Although not everyone is in the

position to make environmental de-

cisions, three serious organiza-
tions are available for those who
merely have a public interest in
matters concerning the environ-
ment. " - »

Environment: Pittsburgh 1EPi
the Group Against Smog and P01-
lution ¢GASP). and the Pennsyl-
vania Interest Research Group
(PIHG) have open membership
for any concerned citizens.$a

E:P

Environment: Pittsburgh is a
non-profit. tax exempt. educa-
tional foundation that dealswith
environmental problems in and
around the Pittsburgh area.

Founded in 1970, by David
Marshall, the group deals in clean-
ups of parks and riverbanks, re-
habilitation of the ghetto, and
battling energy and‘ industrial
problems.

With no newspaper or organ-
ized meeting place. EP considers
itself an action group." In fact.
Marshall. explained that "we‘re
too active to be involved in beau-
raucratic matters of that sort."

Membership fee for EP is $1
annually and open to anyone
interested in_ Pittsburgh or the en-
vironment. '

GASP

In 1969. 43 concerned citizens
who had testified at a public
hearing on Air pollution, became
"an ecological David and set out

to the Goliath of environmental

pollution."

These citizens are now known as
GASP, Group Against "Smog and
Pollution.

Primarily, GASP works within
the Pittsburgh Community to lobby
for and enforce safe environmen-
tal legislation. In t-heirfirst year,
the organization saw the need to
make the public aware of the
goals of a clean air, and to ac?
complish this goal, introduced

“clean air cans,” buttons, bumper .

sticker, and decals.

A spokesman for GASP. Gloria
Anderson. sa_vs that the club is
"extremely interested" in begin-
ning a "new“ group at Pitt. The
old Pitt chapter dissolved a few
years back when interested stu-
dents graduated.

PIRG _

The Pennsylvania Interest Re-
search Group (PIRG). Ralph
Nader inspired, is an organiza-
tion that represents the concerns
of college students and necessary

social change for the benefit of.

all citizens.

Members deal with issues such
as consumer protection, resource
planning, environmental control,
and attempt to present the facts
to the academic community.

Pitt PIRG has recentlyworked
with Dr. Ernest S. Sternglass of
the School of Medicine, helping
to gather data on whether or not
nuclear power plants are safe

enough to operate without de-

The group maintains that before
Pitt's chapter can be in full force,
however, a $2 a term fee must be
added to each student’s‘academic
invoice. Until the administration
accepts this proposal, PIRG can-
not function at its fullest force,
according to its leaders. '

the foundation for our present
political system of democracy.
Nations have battled each other
over how to govern their citizens
and kingdoms have believed in
the divine rights of their royal
monarchs. There have been dic-
tatorships and coups. socialism
and communism. fascism and de-
mocracy.

Many times there has been noth-
ing more than chaos. Whatever the
system, the debate of politics will
go on forever.$a

While great men set guidelines
on how to rule, we as citizens try
to influence our legislators and
countrymen on how government
should be. Many political groups
are organized around the campus
and each one serves an important
function in local and national
elections and policy-making.

The following is a run-down
of so.me of the most active poli-
tically-oriented groups around
Pittsburgh. . '

DEMOCRATS

The College Young Democrats
(CYD) have been the leading
Democratic organization on Pitts
campus since their birth in 1961.
and recently have played a lead-
ing role in Pittsburgh politics.

In the spring primaries, the
CYD’s endorsed and worked vigor-
ously for Councilman, Richard

Caliguiri, mayoral candidate,
and council candidate, Frank
Lucchino.

According to Lucchino. "t_he
Pitt CYD's helped him because
the only independent to win a
Democratic nomination for_ City
Council in the May primary."

Ing1972» the CYD’s were active
in George McGovern‘s campaign

for the presidency. During that
period, the club worked hard on
registration drives, (concentrating
on Pitt students.) and lobbying

efforts directed towards important ’

legislation.

For this year, CYD plans to.

expand its efforts ‘by campaign-
ing for Democratic nominees and
placing club members into candi-

dacy for minor posts such as‘

committeeman.
sos

Students for a Democratic (SDS) ’ V
society is one of the largest political '
United _
States, but according to Kathy Lind-, V

organizations in the

sley. an SDS spokesman, Pitt's

chapter is'not doing extremely 

well in membership.

Most. notably, SDS isopposed».

to._ racism, and most of their
activity is sparked by a racist act
or policy. Among SD_S activities

their activities aren’t so “‘wild-

On Pittsburgh’s South Side, like
many sections of the city are the
“descendants ofimmigrants who
built up Pittsburgh in the l800’s.
-Poles, Slavs, Irishmen, Germans,
Scots,’and Russians, along with
arious other ethnic groups sweat-
ed-- in" the- mills and factories to
build a highly-productive city.
{In_Iearlier times, each ethnic group
jiabited their own community,
spreading an Old World flavor
across the city. Some of the ethnic
‘c_ommuniti'es still exist in areas
—su(;li. as Polish Hill, Lawrence-
lle,’ and McKees Rocks. But as
\, Frank J. Wenslovas, a Lithuanian
 _o_rtician_ on the South Side point-»
.%€.=e? ged out, “as a city grows and ex-
‘"a_nds, people of different ethnic

moving away from their parti-
._cu_lar community, slowly breaking
_down the strong ethnic commun-
ities thatonce existed.”

These are the people who built
Pittsburgh. the ones who sweat in
glass factories and behind blast
furnafces. These are the people
who made other Pittsburghers‘
gmongrthe nation's most rich and
ofwerful. .

slowly being demolished and re-
placed by malls and town-houses.

Once Pittsburgh grew. pollution
and smog began to cover the town.
causing a darkness to cover the
city practically 24 hours a day.
It was nicknamed the Smoky
City. Grimesville. and known
throughout most of America as
an ugly steel town.

In the postwar years however.
Pittsburgh planners and entre-
preneurs planned a transforma-
tion for the city. A smoke-
abatement drive wiped the black
shroud from the skies and for the
first time in many years. clear
skies occasionally appear above
the city. which. nevertheless is
still one of the most polluted in
the country. Old buildings were
cleaned. and the whole lower
city known as the Point area was
completely re—built. The whole‘
project was called Pittsburgh's
Renaissance Program. and,that‘s
exactly what had happened——the
smoky city had been re-born
and was actually transformed to
a city with much less soot. smog.
and ugliness.

Many areas were forgotten in

-the Renaissance program how-

ever,_ such as the Hill District
and Homewood-Brushton. These

. are Pittsburgh’s two largest black

ghetto communities. The “Hill”
is situated directly uptown from
the city, while Homewood-Brush-
ton _is further east. Both sections
add to the tempo of the city and
have contributed to the growth of
Pittsburgh. I

university area called Oakland has
numerous museums and art

galleries. parks and lecture halls.

It is in this throbbing section of
the city. where Dr. Jonas Salk
discovered a cure for polio and
where Henry Mancini and Gene
Kelly developed their talents.
Andrew Carnegie opened the
first free library to the public

' in Oakland. and here too is where

bitter quarrels between the uni-
versity and the Oakland commun-
ity create tension, as the institu-
tion grows and continues to force

_ residents from their homes.

Just east of the Oakland area
are where most of the students
live and where the fashionable
districts of Pittsburgh are located.
Communities such as Shadyside,
Squirrel Hill, and'Point Breeze
are small sections of academics
and more affluent Pittsburghers,
situated within the city limits,
yet carrying a small town peace-
fulness «and tranquility through-
out their neighborhoods.

Shadyside not only contains
enormous mansions of splendid
architectural design. but is also
the center of the city‘s more bo-
hemian type of people. Walnut
Street, the main street of Shady-
side provides a potpourri of bou-
tiques, art.galleries. head shops.
and emporiums. Bards and Jes-
ters Coffeehouse adds to the
tempo of the neighborhood. along
with human growth centers and
waterbed shops.

Squirrel Hill. the section follow-
ing Shadyside is primarily a
Jewish community. another com-
munity of ethnic and religious
pride. as well as a student area
for the city’s large population of
students.

Some parks just don‘t have

-.charm, but Pittsburgh3s oldest

has what it takes to attract hund-
reds ‘of college students “daily.
"And its only 'a' fiverminute walk
from Pitt's campus. ‘

Schenley Park, a 300-acre stretch

of land donated to the city by
Mary‘E. Schenley in. 1889, has
become one of the. most popular
"do anything" areas in Pittsburgh-

v-‘Two ‘years, before .Pitt moved

V its campus from North Side» to

Oakland in .1907, Schenley Park

had gained notorietyfor racing.

The first automobile race in Pitts-,
burgh was conducted there July

4,1899, and in 1907, a matinee

race track was completed-—the san
year that the Schenley Park

Oval opened:  " '

-Phipp’s ‘Conserva tory, and in front’
of Carnegie-Mellon, _Unive.rsity's

The concerts, which sometimes
feature local groups such. as
Gravel, are a far ,cry from the

‘first municipal band‘ concert held '

.in, the city there on July 2, 1911.
The atmosphere is definitely very
‘ _relaxed, but usually overcrowded.

. .Concer_tst_here have the makings ,'

emplified by "real" rock concerts.

At the top of the Oval hill are

groups throughout the city—isn‘t
anything to crow about. then again.
it's not the worst.

If you're out looking to have a
good time. then meander up there
some afternoon or night.

The park also provides a touch

of history with another of its‘
'landmarks——the Panther Hollow

in memory of old George West-
inghouse. It is" a gathering place

‘for thinkers, lovers, and even

And ‘horses? Try {riding them

Speaking of. riding, special

New Brunswick that weekend.
And as the ride progressed. it
was obvious that Williams was a
football fan.

“Oh,” he said, when told about
the track meet.

"Well. you have to understand
that I am a football fan. You could
say that I particularly follow East-
ern football. And. I'm glad to see
Pitt. once for all, trying to get
off its feet. Or should I say. get
out from under the feet of major
Eastern football.

 
  
 
  
   
  
   
  
   
  
   
  
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  
 

L; Riggs believes"that women in sports receive too much at-
tention and too much money. He was out to prove that his argu-
Frnent was legitimate. But did he prove his point?

 7 Hardly! Mr. Riggs missed the mark entirely. What he did
as rattle one ‘of the best women tennis players through such
ntics as constant talking. attracting undue attention and ingen-
ral being obnoxious. He could have put as much pressure on a
el_lo.w male player and the results could have been the same and
any‘ top male pros are afraid to play him. —

' " At the end of the match he declared an all out battle against
be female segment of the tennis world... Riggs declared him-
elfa ?‘specialist” on the issue of women in sports. He will
a‘ve_ the opportunity to test his theory again as Chris Everet
Billy Jean King have challenged him. The match with Ever-

. I To be fair to Bobby Riggs, however. we must concede that
alone does not hold the opinion that men are superior to wom-
 in sports or for that matter in everything. But right now I am
ealing with the sports aspect. Many an athlete. coach. athletic
i’rector—-the list goes on, feel this way. A ,

I say that given the same opportunities as men. women
an be just as good if not superior to men. But these opportun-
ﬁrs have not existed to any large extent. Because they are
_omen they do not receive the money. facilities. and training

- The reasons listed for not receiving these benefits are many.
omen are supposedly biologically inferior, not sports oriented
nd in general not good enough to deserve sports equality.

_ .After investigating the subject (although common sense
.Vp_oints to the same conclusion) it has been scientifically proven
;._that women are biologically superior to men and a sizable per-
._§e.,Iitage are interested in sports. And given the opportunities.
‘ _omen can and will excell in athletics.

‘Don't get me wrong. I feel that there has been some change
oward equality. An example of this is the outstanding girl's
p_o__rt_s program in the state of Iowa. The man responsible for
hisprogram is Wayne Cooley. former assistant to the presi-
ent of Grinnell College. He is new chief executive officer of
he Iowa Girl's High School Athletic Union.

. This association sanctions 17 championships in 13 dif-
‘rent sports for women and operate on an annual budget of $600,-
 Most of this money comes from gate receipts collected at

E -. This is just one of many possible programs set up for wom-
nin ‘athletics. My hope is that programs like Iowa's will enter
every facet of life from grade school to professional sports.
Thenif people feel it "necessary" to stage various "Battle of
\t,he.Sexes" we will see who is superior. But isntthat really a
waste of time and energy Bobby Riggs’? . — —

Skyscraper U. has won
eight national championships and
trails‘ only Southern Cal and
UCLA in the department. Consi-
dering how Oakland athletics have
fared the last 10 years, this is
amazing. '

The University of Pittsburgh

vhasn’t won anything the last 10

years, let alone national titles.
After the fabulous 1963 season, in
which Pitt achieved a 9-1 mark, a
No. 2 ranking in the nation, and
(by a quirk) ‘received no bowl bid,
the program has been on the
slide. ‘ -

After John Micholoson was fired
in 1964, Pitt had hired Dave Hart
to again make the Panther growl
and Carl DePasqua to return Pitt
to fundamentals. Hart accumu-
lated a 3-27 mark in his three
years and "DePasqua’s fate was
not too much better. And after the
1-10 mark in ’72, the roof had cav-
ed in. I

But the groundwork for the
cavein had taken place at the
same time the Cats were enjoy-.

ing their last moment of glory-
1963. At that time Pitt, Penn
State, West. Virginia, and Syra-
cuse formed the Big Four Agree-
ment. This agreement called for
a reassessment of recruiting
practices and was supposed to
set a model for the rest of the
collegiate football world to fol-
low. It called for 25 football schol-
arships a year and set more rigid
requirements for incoming ath-
letes. After Michelosen was fired,
Pitt went further by deeempha-
sizing the importance of football.
Not even the slick recruiting of
Hart could offset this. Not even
DePasqua’s fundamentals could
pick up the slack. The created
manpower shortage and the pen-
ny pinching administration made
failures of these two coaches.

Now, this same administration
fully expects Majors to win (big)
and return Pitt to where it was in
1963. But, Majors will have help.

The Big Four was smashed last
Thanksgiving and Majors — re-
puted to be the best young coach
available—was hired in Decem-
ber. And Dean Billick has under-
taken the most awesome publi-

‘city campaign ever in the Pitt'

Athletic Department.

At last- report Majors had ac-
cumulated somewhere near 60 re-
cruits and money was pouring in
from interested sources. Also.
get this. Season ticket sales have
already surpassed last years to-
tal (so far over 8,100 season tix
have been sold. That total is 1,800
over last year’s 7,800 mark).

In this year’s spring Blue-Gold

game, Majors had 60 player-st

available to play. Georgia the
"73 opening opponent had over
120 players at its disposal. This
has been the Pitt problem all
along. If nothing else, Majors has
come close to equaling numbers.

"Pitt is one of the greatest op-
portunities around for a coach,"
Majors has said. “It has a reputa-
tion and it has something to sell.
I’m not going to say that we are
going to win right away, but we
are going to play with pride and
we are going to win."

Majors took over- a pitiful pro-
gram at Iowa State five years ago
and brought that school its only
two bowl game appearances in
its history the last two years.
Now the same is asked of him
here.

Just the other day, Majors was
quizzed about the possibility that
Pitt might not win the first cou-
ple of years. Majors replied: “I
have a five year contract.”

But let’s just say that Pitt does
not win and the Majors magic
does not work here. What then?

Robert H. Williams had an an-
swer for that as he was opening,

‘the cab door for his passenger to

get out.

“If you guys don’t win this time
around, you had better -hang them
up.‘ If Majors can't do it, no one
can.” ‘

Robert H. Williams would hate
to see that happen.

In tramurals Flourish -

by G. W. STEVENS
Participation in organized sports

. here at the University is not lim-

ited to only those students who
participate in the varsity pro-
gram. The University also offers
a very broad and competitive pro-
gram of intramural sports. The
program is desinged to give those
students who may not have extra-
ordinary physical ability or a

' great deal of free time, a chance

to compete in a wide range of
sporting events.

Under the direction of Intramur-
al Director Leo Bemis, thou-
sands of students, faculty, and
staff members_partici'pate in the
program every year. All of the
University’s facilities are made
available. to competing teams.
There is no cost for entering in
any of the intramural sports. and
the Intramural Department
makes every effort to make the
program an enjoyable and worth- .
while experience.

A wide range of sports are of-
_‘ fered through the Intramural, De-I

 

 

partment. Competition in softball,
touch football, basketball, soccer,
wrestling, and numerous other
sports is set up with the non-
athlete in mind. Six divisions are
established for each sport—fra-
ternity, dormitory, graduate-fac-
ulty, engineering, club, and inde-
pendent—and teams compete for
the division championship as well
as an overall vhampionship.

Students interested in partici-

pating in the intramural program -

should watch the Pitt News as
well as, bulletin boards through-
out the campus for important no-
tices. Team entry blanks are
available for every sport in the
Intramural office. If you are not
a member of any group or organ-
ization which bas a team in one
of the divisions listed above, join
one or get a group together and
form a team of your own. Or, it is
possible for a student to sign up
as an unattached player at the
IM office. .v .

The students are paying for the
facilities here at the University

. and they f_s"hould‘ take‘, advantage

   

of every opportunity to use them.
Those who have participated in
the program in the past have got-
ten more than a good physical
workout for their efforts. Parti-
cipants also have an opportunity
to meet new people and have
themselves a good -time.

THE large increase in the foot-
ball squad this season has re- .
sulted in an urgent need for
managers. A total of eight posi-
tions must be filled, which is
more oepnings than there have
ever been at one time.

Benefits to managers include
free tickets to games, varsity
letters, free books, free meals
at the training table, and even-
tually, traveling with the team
to some road games.

’ Anyone interested’in becom-i
ing a manager should call head
manager Jim Gervase at 682-
9702, or write to him at the Pitt

'‘ Field House, Pittsburgh, Pa.

ant KNIGHT

Pitt basketball doesn't get un-
der way until late November. but
when it does. you will hear more
about Billy Knight than almost
everybody else combined.

For the past two seasons. Pitt
basketball has centered around
Billy Knight. and it should do so
again this season. As a junior
last season. Knight led the team
in just about every category. in-
cluding shooting. rebounding. and
foul shooting. An honorable men-
tion on some All-American teams
last year. he stands a good shot at
making the first or second team
this season.

Beginning his sixth year as
head coach will be Charles

 

 

 iK...t.T.R.m.mb..

'Buzz” Ridl. Rid] is joined by as-

sistants Fran Webster and Tim
Grgurich to form a staff that will
try to brake the .500 hurdle this
season. -

This season offers Ridl the most
talented team he's ever had. and
with Knight improving each sea-
son. Ridl hopes that this will be
the year his Panthers can get it
all together. V

Also returning as seniors will
be Sam Fleming. a guard-forward
from Fifth Avenue High: Mickey
Martin. 6-5 forward who averaged
12.5 points per game; Ken Wagon-
er. a defensive-type guard. and
big man Lucius Keese. who at 6-10
was the tallest player to ever

 

wear a Pitt uniform. until this
season when Ridl recruited a big-
get‘ one. '

Other returnees who have seen V
plenty of action previously include,

sophomore guards Tom Richards
and Keith Starr, guard-forward
Kirk Bruce, and forward Jim
Bolla.

In addition. a junior varsity
squad that lost only twice will be
battling for positions on the squad.

The schedule promises a lot of
excitement. with Pitt meeting
many top-ranked teams. both at
home and away.

Home game opponents include
Cornell, Army, Bucknell, Duke,

U 2 iMenday,i a......;1s; 1973 QTHEA pm mivrs'—Page,-K13.

George Washington, Penn State,
Kent State, Syracuse, Temple,
and West Virginia. _

Road games find the Panthers
meeting Rutgers. Virginia. Dav-
idson. William and Mary. West
Virginia. Penn State. and South
Carolina.

In addition. Pitt will compete
in two tournaments during the

  

season. the Steel Bowl. which is : 
held at the Civic Arena -and in-

cludes Duquesne. and the Razor-
back Tournament. held in Little
Rock. which includes Arkansas.

Hockey is alive and well here at
the University. The Pitt Hockey
Club is at the services of the -stu-
dents. Note the name “Club";
hockey is not a varsity sport here
at Pitt but the University does

, compete in the Western Pennsyl- _

Vania Intercollegiate Hockey As-
sociation, all member teams be-
ingjof the club status.

Pitt has been the champion of

the WPIHA for the last two years,

or since the leagues origin, and
the hockey program at Pitt is de-
veloping quite rapidly. Funds are
allocated to the_ team by Student

 

Government and with the recent
success, student support may

well help to project the sport to a '

varsity status within the, next
few years.

Currently the club is open to‘
any and all interested students,
providing that they have the pro-
per.e_quipment- and a slight back- ‘
ground of hockey experience. The
latter is minimal. During fall and _

winter terms, the-team, which is
- comprised of the best members

of the club chosen by coaches,

practices twice a ‘week. The prac-

tices are open to all members and

the .18 team members are chosen

by the coaches to represent Pitt
in the games. ..

We can help you.

 As you may suspect, selecting a stereo
‘system is more than just a matter of taste. It
 isfirst and foremost the process of discover-
ing just how much performance you can get
for your dollar. How much sound will a
1-ysystem produce? How much of the full
gmusical range does it cover? How clean and
"detailed is the overallsound?

: We at Audio Warehouse are uniquely able to
_;demonstrate sound in our stores and show the
_-[easily audible differences that may be im-
portant to you. But we can be of help even
before you come in. Because we spend a good
fdeal of our time evaluating all kinds of stereo
?:equipment for‘ ourselves, we can supply a
. {good preliminary summary of what perfor-
 ance characteristics can be had at what
'"“ri’ce, what you will gain if you spend more,
hat characteristics you might want to see
 mphasized at a given price level.

What your dollars buy: A Summary.

With alimited budget ($200-$300), you can
get a system of reasonable accuracy, but
some sacrifices are necessary at the ex-

tremes of the musical range to get satis-

factory acoustic output (loudness). A system
in this price range is‘ most appropriate to
small listening areas.

With a moderate ‘ budget ($400-500). you
have two choices. On one hand,-you can get a
system which provides accurate musical re-
production in every respect, with sufficient
sound output for medium size rooms (2000
cubic feet or less). Alternatively, if you like to
play music very loud in a large room, you can
select a different kind of system in this price
range that sacrifices some musical accuracy
(bass response in particular) to lget extra
sound. output.

With somewhat more to spend ($550-$700),
you will be able to get a system that combines
completely satisfying accuracy with ample
output for even very large listening areas and
very loud musical levels. In addition, it will
include features which add to ease and flex-
ibility of operation, and which help to pre-
serve your records. For mo_st people, the
point of diminishing returns is in this price
range.
