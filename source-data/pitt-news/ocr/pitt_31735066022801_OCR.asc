Affirmative Action On The Campus
Total Equality Is The Ultimate Goal

By SETH H. LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

When affirmative action was im-
plcmented on the college campus in
the early 1970’s, women’s and
minority groups viewed, the non-
discrimination programs as_ a
monumental step in their battle for
total equality. Finally there was a
method to overcome past discrimin-
atory practices. .

Yet it was an explosive issue.
Some critics saw the federally man-
dated programs as intrusions into
academic freedom. Other
academics paralleled their criticisms
with the conservatives in the private
sector of the economy, who claimed
federal prohibitions against
discrimination would lead to the
destruction of the free enterprise
system.

Another controversy arose over
the development and implementa-
tion of these programs, as large
resources are required to gather and
process data, make massive reports,
and conduct constant communica-
tions with different federal agencies

-and officials.

AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION

Whateventhe arguments, pro or
con. adherence to an active affirma-
tive action program weighs heavily
in institutions dependent on federal
funds for research. Sanctions in the
form of delays or termination of
federal contracts can cause long-
range damage to a university. The
results in layoffs of non-tenured
faculty or restrictions of training
for graduate students wreaks havoc
on university standing and
prestige—not to mention the
adverse publicity of discrimination
suits.

Briefly stated, affirmative action
within the higher education system
is a legally binding doctrine requir-
ing a . university to develop and
implement non-discriminatory pro-
cedures, andto ensure the equitable
treatment of women and minorities
in hiring and promotion.

Even after the passage . of

ing discovered on the campus.
Up until 1975, when civil rights
legislation had been in effect for

V over a decade, charges of sex

discrimination in institutions of
higher learning outnumbered those
in any other industry in America.
More than 500 institutions were
charged under Executive Order
11246; about 1,600 charges were fil-
ed under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964; and close to
1,000 charges were filed under the
Equal Pay Act. In 1973, 1 out of
every 40 charges submitted to the
late Department of Health, Educa-
tion, and Welfare were against an
institution of higher learning.
Massive federalinvolvement in

the‘ enforcement of affirmative ac- '

tion in higher education began in
January, 1970, when a relatively
unknown ’women’s /civil rights
group, the Women’s Equity Action
League (WEAL) filed a class action
suit against the nation’s colleges
and university community, charg-
ing an “industry-wide” pattern of
sex discrimination.

,_ Women Claim Pornography Causes

By JANE HOLAHAN

This past Saturday, Women
Against Sexist Violence in Por-
nography and Media sponsored “A
Conference on Pornography: A
Feminist Perspective” at the
Graduate School of Public Health.
Such topics as child pornography,
and the effects of pornography on
male aggression were discussed.
The Falk Medical Fund contributed
$1,000 to the conference, and the
University of Pittsburgh Office of
Urban and Community ‘Services
and Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape ‘helped in planning the con-
ference.

Dr. Norman N. Miller, a

recently spoke at Pitt on “Politics

Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA), and the University Center
for International Studies (UCIS).
Addressing an audience largely of
foreign and graduate students,

research on the effects of porn-
ography on male aggression.
According to Donnerstein, “There
is a direct correlation between por-
nography and violence against
women. The more violent the por-
nography, the more aggressive the
man viewing the pornography
becomes.” '

Other speakers included Florence
Rush, a social worker and therapist
who spoke on child pornography.
According to Rush, 1.2 million
children, some as young as three
years old, are forced into por-
nography. '

Tanzania and Kenya.

Miller cited two models of
development, using Kenya and Tan-
zania as the basis of research he has
conducted for more than two
decades while in Africa.

Miller explained that Kenya and
Tanzania are two different experi-
ments in -political development.
Depicting Kenya as the anthropol-
ogical beginnings of man, Miller

outlined the

of this vastly agricultural country.

There were also a number of
workshops that dealt with such
issues as, “Pornography and First
Amendment Rights,” “Rape and
P°T_“03YaPhY.” and “Toward a
Definition of Pornography,”

development is pro-Western, he
said, “The Kenya model allows for
a free enterprise system which has
‘ little government control and a-class
system of development.’ ’ '

He also described some of the
hardships Kenya has encountered
since modeling its government on a
free enterprise system; adding that
Kenya. is “victimized by world
prices for industrial purposes, ’ ’ -and
due to Kenya_’s model of political
development, “economic disrup-
tion and political unrest is likely to
develop.”

Violence

.“What’s frightening,” said Mary
Kiernan-Stearn, who conducted a
workshop on family violence, “is
that these thingsare becoming com-
mon practice in the media. Violence
is more tolerated now, and we are

becoming desensitized.’ ’
Donnerstein refutes the idea that

pornography works as a “safety.

valve” on society.

“Pornography does not have a
releasing effect, our research shows
just the opposite. People act out
Pornography is

if people sit down, and talk about

‘the lies inherent in much por-

Miller states, “Tanzania is‘

' Nyerere; Nyerere is Tanzania.”

Nyerere’s policy is a mixture of col-
lectivization, decentralization of
government, and most of all,
educational and agricultural self-

reliance.

Miller points out that “Nyerere’s
economic policy has still to be
worked out.” Miller cited various
examples of the pressing economic

roads and bridges which are vital in
the transportation of Tanzania’s
food produce, and also Tanzania’s
heavy dependence on foreign oil.

Miller went on to discuss the
strategic importance of East Africa.
He described the horn of Africa as a
“zone of crisis,” _referring to the
current world situation in the Mid-
dle East, adding that “Saudi Arabia
is the center of big political develop-
ments.” '

Criticizing U.S. foreign policy,
Miller said that the present policy
for Africa is “outdated.” He ex-
plained that the view that 51

i .../

Africanistates are a homogenous
contine’nt rather than 51 nations
with diverse political and economic
interests is an “enormous mis-
understanding in the U.S. State
Department of East Africa.” Ac-
tually, the politics in East Africa are
of class, with a tremendous focus
on agriculture and development,’
Miller added.

Miller sensed a need for the
United States to make policy with
Africa. ‘

“The smartest thing America can
do is become African-centric.” He
added that “President Carter

With an impending economic’

But unlike the turbulence of the
sixties, the Americans of the 80's

only results of the last six and a

the hostages might be released

With open arms we welcomed
upwards of 30,000 Cuban
refugees and in the next breath,
there were racial tensions
throughout, the refugee centers.
Florida seems to have more than
its share of troubles this summer,
and more than a few hotel
owners have to bite the bullet as
tourists are warned to stay away

from Miami. Even the schools
are closed.
There seems to ’be a

reawakening of several values
as this decade has begun to un-
fold. After an appropriate period

of silence after Vietnam, there is
a new, out-of-the-closet
patriotism. The best evidence of
which is. an abundance of stores
selling T-shirts with American
flags on them. I

But at the same time there is a
heightened sense of responsi-

- bility and involvement. This more

knowledgable, and perhaps
more personal, sense of commit-
ment « unfolding in many
Americans heralds anew kind of

“demonstrator,” one who is go- .
ing to change the system from

the inside, not the outside. And if
they get at the problems from
the weakest point inside,
perhaps we have a second
chance to affect some change.

should take a strong stand on
Africa.”

Viewing the Soviet Union as a
major factor in the importance of
his “zone of crisis,” Miller predicts‘
that the Soviet Union‘ will run out
of its own oil reserves by 1987 and
thus “conflict begins.’ "

“The Soviet design is to bracket
the Red Sea area, to centrally block
or control Red Sea access.”

Miller sees the Soviets attempting
to influence and "set up a league of
states centering around the Red Sea
and Africa’s horn. Of the states
mentioned, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
South Yeman, Somali, and others
are areas where the “arc of’
conﬂict’ ’ exists.

He also views the liberation strug-
gles as the focus of the Soviet
threat, of which Miller terms the
“race weapon.” He related his
view to the ongoing liberation
struggles currently taking place in
Africa, saying that many of these
struggles are Soviet induced.

“Since 1977 the Soviets have only
given military aid, while aid for
development given to African na-
tions has ceased.” _

Miller stated that he “doesn’t

‘think the Soviets have a major

design on Africa,” because of the
difficulties that the Soviets are ex-
periencing with many of the
African nations. ‘
During a question and answer
session that followed the lecture,

sor Describes Horn  Africa As ‘Zone Of Crisis"

Miller was asked if the U.S. foreign/

policy towards Africa was racist. ’
uyes, -

He responded by saying
towards South Africa” and added
that the “racist policy of South
Africa seems to support U.S.
economic interests there.’ ’

Many of the questions asked dur-
ing this session focused on U.S.
policy towards Africa. Students
questioned Miller’s criticisms on
Tanzania’s economic priorities and
also the indicators Miller used to
support his findings. One student
questioned if U.S. foreign policy
towards Africa forces Soviet align-

ment with African countries. 5}

ecutive Order 11246. which pro-
hibits any contractor from receiving
federal funds if the employer
discriminates in any fashion,
WEAL started a national campaign
to end discrimination on college
campuses.

Shortly thereafter, HEW inves-
tigated a number of leading institu-
tions,’while WEAL and other civil
rights groups continued to file
charges against a number of univer-

'*;..2;'.ties.

In J'une, 1970, Representative
Edith Green began the first hearings
concerning discrimination against
women in institutions of higher
learning. ' _

The 92nd Congress subsequently
passed new legislation extending
beyond minority concerns to end
sex discrimination in all educational

’ institutions "at all levels, to encom-

pass any forms of discrimination
that’ might exist. ,

It was during this time’ that
affirmative action programs came
of age. The basic laws-applying to
academia are a series of amend-

‘ ments to existing laws to "include

education.

by Executive Order 11375

The initial Executive Order No.
11246 was signed by President‘ Lyn-

I‘

This extensive series of regula-
tions have been quite controversial
in the past, particularly relating to
athletics. Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 states that
“no person in the United States
shall, on the basis of sex, be exclud-
ed from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any educa-
tional program or activity recieving
Federal financial assistance,”

Affirmative action in the institu-
tion is not required, but a program
can be imposed after the discovery
of discrimination.

, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of

I964, ‘as amended by the Equal
Employment ‘Opportunity’ Act of
1972

Title VII was amended on March ‘ii

24, 1972 to include educational in-
stitutions and state and local
government employees. It prohibits
discrimination in employment on
the basis of sex, race color, religion
and national origin. _

Enforced‘ by the Equal -Employ-

ment Opportunity Commission, Ti-

tle VII does. not require affirmative .-

action but employers must
recognize and correct discrimina-
tion in employment.

Affirmative‘ action may be re-

. quired by a court, but only after a

stipulations not to
“discriminate against any employee-
or applicant ‘for employment
because of race, color, religion, or
national origifi.” .
Executive Order 11375, effective
October 13, 1967, was later added
to end sex discrimination. E _
Enforced by the»Office for Civil
Rights (OCR), the order’s main
stipulation is that the contractor
must have a written affirmative ac-
tion plan to “remedy the effects of
past discrimination,” including
numerical goals and timetables for
the hiring of women and minorities
in positions where they previously
lacked representation. -
Contracts can be suspended or
cancelled if the contractor cannot

“show cause” for its failure to im- '

Actually, the Equal Pay Act of

tion, and in July 1972, it was
amended to include executive, ad-
ministrative and professional
employees.

Thus, where the Court had
previously applied its decisions on

Although similar in the_g0al of
nationwide non-discrimination,
there exists an important distinction

between affirmative action and-

“The primary thrust would be
not only increasing the access, but
fuller inclusion in A

Coffey, director of Pitt’s affir-

mative action program.

Coffey said the problem her staff
must try to tackle is “how can you

Campus Calendar

 

FIVE YEARS AGO

Lee Gutl{ind's “The Best Seat in Baseball, But You have to Stand!:
The Game as Umpires See It” was the subject of a Pitt News book
review...the Pitt professor’s book “tells how umpires feel about the
men they judge”...Campus police chief announced that crime on the
Pitt campus drops- “drastically” during the summer months due to

, students going home...The Gray Panthers, an Age and Youth in Ac-

tion Volunteers organization were advertising to help “victims of

_ crime.”

  TEN YEARS AGO _‘

Senator Edmund Muskie was in Pittsburgh to address local

democrats...he was urging “that we reach out for an open
society”...It was announced that the installation of “bright green

 "f Astroturf” was to carpet the Pitt Stadium...Allstate basketball star
L , Billy Knight from Braddock signed with the Panthers.

TEN YEARS AGO

, The Computer Center’s IBM machines were “impressing people with
, their rapidity in solving problems”...“It can do in ten seconds what

it,-takes ten years from the American Cancer Society for cancer
research. . .Little man on Campus, a cartoon feature, showed a pro-
fessor leaving the dean’s office as the dean remarked, “Splendid in-

terview! He’s eccentric, bigoted and conservative. He’ll make a fine

addition to the faculty.”
THIRTY YEARS AGO

Two cheating offences meant a dismissal from the university. . .The
controversial issue of Euthanasia was the subject of debate at the
local Bellefield Church. . .College Fun Magazine, a publication of-
fering “uncensored, uninhibited cartoons, verses, gags, and stories
was available on newsstands. . .General Joseph T. McNarney,
former commanding general of U.S. forces in Europe, led the annual
Armed Forces Day Parade. .
