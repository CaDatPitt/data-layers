“‘Real Stuff,” Says Chan-
cellor Bowman

 

A scene long to ‘be rememberel by
'23 men, and one which touched tender
chords in the recollection of many
old grads present, was the ﬁrst an-
nual stag banquet of the Sophomore
class held last Wednesday  the
Hotel Chatham. 

The banquetters were treated to
old stories of by-gone class scraps
and campus life, to word pictures of
the noisy banquets held when Pitt
was Wup, directly from the old
grads who had been there, and to

men now in the making.

The principal speeches were made
by the toastmaster, Walther Riddle,
’93; Chancellor John G. Bowman, Dean

president of the Sophomore class.
Dr. Bowman, in speaking of the
banquet after it was over, said:

tended which was ,exactly like it;
everything was done so sincerely and
the boysexpressed their purposes so
clearly. There was nothing poor or
foolish about il}—it was all ‘igeal
stuff.’ I want to. see more things like
that around here-. It ought to ‘be
continued by this class next year and
every year. Such things as that‘ are
the making of the whole place.”

“Tom” Holleran expressed his be-
lief in ’23 and what it is doing. He
pleaded for the continuance of the
activities‘ the class has started, and
told how much the football team ap-
preciated support from the stands. He
was greeted, as was the chancellor,-
with many cheers and applause.

Dean Wright, discussing the class
and school spirit from the academic
standpoint, pointed out how closely
the two features of college life are
allied. He emphasized the fact that in
the days before the war Pitt classes

were all well organized--and told of

how, because of military preparation,
class organization and fellowship
melted away. He declared his pleasure
in seeing" that ’23 was

the class, reiterating the

gym for the Bucknell’ basket
game.

Sophs carried the evening away.
When Chancellor
Toastmaster Riddle asked to be in

vited to the banquet next year, the
Sophomores took action right away
and unanimously invited -them. The
S University “Jazz Four" furnished the

music at the banquet.

The debaters representing Pennsyl-
"vania -State College, Robert F. Sterner,

Thaw Hall, WhereHard-
ing’s ‘Address Was Deliv-
-ered . by Wireless Tele-
phone—-Pitt Only School In
Tri-State District to-Obtain
Speech

 

 

 

For the ﬁrst time‘ in the history of
science a President’s inaugural ad-
dress wasdelivered last Friday to the
leading cities. of the country by means
of the wireless telephone and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, through the ef-
forts of the Department of Electrical
Engineering, was the only school in
the tri-state district to receive the
speech in this manner. The appara-
tus for recording was installed in
room 105, Thaw Hall, under the sup-
ervision of Prof. H. E. Dycke, E. B.
Rath and H. C. Krapf, the latter oper-
ating the loud-speaking telephone.
The transmitted address provided
n\oyel amusement for nearly 200 stu-
dents, many being turned away owing
to lack of accommodations in the
room. It. was not until late Friday
‘morning ‘that Prof, Dycke had the
slightest intimation that Pitt could»
have the opportunity to hear Presi-
dent Harding in his own voice. Begin-
- ning,sliortly after 11 a. m., and con-
tinuing to 12:40 o’clock, the audience
of Pitt men was entertained by musi-
cal selections, the President’s address
coming  at noon, being 40 minutes
in lengthzx, The reproduction of the
music and‘-of President Harding's
voice was clearly audible at all times.
A large megaphone was constructed to
serve as an ampliﬁer. ‘
When asked how Pitt was able to
get exclusive wireless service Prof.
Rath ‘said that the Electrical Engin-
eering Department was exceedingly
fortunate in obtaining one of the loud
speaking reproducing telephones,
there being only three of these instru-
ments in the city, the other two oper-
ating downtown.
“Furthermore,” he said, .“we have
one of the largest wireless outﬁts in
operation here. Often times our op-
erator picks up messages from Bor-

tions in and outside of this country.”

SELECTED  

“Done and Undone” to be
Presented in Schenley The-
ater, April 7,8 and 9+
New York Musical House‘
to Publish Several Numbers

The Cap and Gown Club is complet-
ing arrangements to stage its thir-
teenth annual offering, “Done and Un-
done.” The production is scheduled to
run at the Schenley Theater Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday, April 7, 8
and 9, with a matinee on ‘Saturday,
April 9. The play offers a sustained
thrill in which attention is riveted at
the start and not releasedpuntil the
very end. amid a rapid succession of
laughter and jollity.

Cyril Lang, director of’ the cast, says
“Done and Undone" is a genuine and
‘bright musical adventure with music
and a plot that gives credit to the
authors. Its spirited fun, music and
dancing, its merry travesties and
specialties, he declares, typify the best
that musical novelties offer.

A New York musical publishing
house has applied to the -Cap and
Gown club for permission to publish
several of the musical numbers. The
composer, Bennie Levant, Med. '21, is
recalled as furnishing the. music and
directing the orchestra for “Dr.
Divorce,” 1917; “Vaudeville,” 1918,
and “As You Were,” 1919. Bennie has
given many song and dance hits to the
Cap and Gown stage, “MY K01'e3n
Maid,” “My Dev-onshire Maid','=' “Moth-
er Nature’s Chile,” “Love’s Sweet
Melody”. and “When Parson Sims
Sings Ragtime Hymns” being a few of
these. »

The individual‘ and sprakling lyrics,
set to music, tell 11 interesting stories,
of which “Maid of My Dreams,” “Aud-
rey,” “Those Telephonin’ Blues” and
“Vampin" arethe outstanding. “Maid
of My Dreams” is the theme song that
runs through the play now in solo,
then in dust and again in chorus. It
is a simple and_,appealing love song .111
which the hero ﬁnds his dreamgirl
at last. “Audrey” is termed to bud
into a bright hit. “Those Telephonin’
Blues" is a- telephone specialty
described as the bluest of blues.
“Vampin” is a weird song with an
eccentric tune. A large syncopated or-
chestra is being assembled to give

 

tings.

pealing, and others that were weird _
and grotesque were combined at the
entertainment given by the Pitt ‘Cos-
mopolitan club last Thursday; even-
ing, in Carnegie Music ‘Hall. In the
latter category belong the numbers/
given .by the troup of four Chinese.
The program was varied and truly
cosmopolitan, as was also the audi- ,
ence. {  ~

Naturally, some of the numbers
made a bigger hitwith the audience
than others; but all were liberally ap-I
plauded, so that it is really diﬂicult to
say which carried off the high honors.
The exhibitions by the Pitt Dancers,
bits of Scotch humor by Ian Forbes,
and the piano solo by Prof. Toch Di
Leo and the vocal numbers by Mrs.
Romaine Smith Russell were among
those which recieiived the loudest ‘ac-
claim. ’ ‘

~ The program opened with ‘a classic
overture by the Pitt orchestra. A sort
of medley and babel of tongues, aryan
and semitic, oriental and ‘occidental,
was brought to the ears of the audi-
ence when the not unfamiliar stanzas
of “Mary Had a Little Lamb” were re-
cited ﬁrst in English, and then in 10
other languages, each by some mem-
ber of the: Cosmopolitan club. Possi-
bly lacking in aesthetic as well as in
“jazzy” qualities, but strikingly ex-
pressive of the monotonous placidity
of the Chinese and their oriental'mys-
ticism were the qiiaint and uncanny
numbers played by a Chinese troupe
on instruments equally j quaint. The
fact that one of the Chinese songs
given as -an encore ‘had been in the
original 21. popular German student
song, did not detract from its intrin-
sic merits. " *
Airs from ‘Mass-enet, Dvorak and
Landon Ronald were sung by ‘Mrs.
Romaine Smith Russell. Her encore
number was well received. A violin
quartet consisting; of Messrs. Isadore ,
Levine, Mark Mciguiggan; Joe Re-‘
plogle and Thomas 'Smink, , gave an
interpretation of Beethoven's solemn
and somewhat plaintive, Andante Re-
ligios-o. “Largheti§0" and ‘ “Grave”
adaptations from“ Kreis1er-Tartin.i’s
- “The Devil's Trill~,~*=" were- rendered by
Isadore Levine with Ethlyn Brown at
the piano. .
Robert Grauer, Harry Guthbertson
and Gertrude Friedlander of the Pitt
Play.ers,‘under the direction of Prof.
I. C. Raines, presented a one-act play-
let, entitled “A Pot of Broth.” The
sketch, written «by W. B. Yeats, is
based on a fairy tale of a similar
name. A French one act comedy by

given by Mlle. Juliette Perrusset,«and
Messrs. I. Gardescu and M. C. Tar-
cauanu, all of the Pitt Cosmopolitan
club. The twopiano solos, Trotto di
Cavalleria, of his own composition,
and Jeaux d’Ea.u by Maurice Rave1,. by
Prof. di Leo, were warmly received, as
was also his encore ’num=ber. Ian
Forbes, an alumnus of the University,
and a member of the Cosmopolitan’
club, out-Laudered Harry Lauder, in
his illustrations of bits of ‘Scotch
‘humor. He was twice summoned
from “behind the curtains” by in-
sistent applause of the crowd, which
chimed in with the singing of the
favorite Scotch ballad, “Oh, I Love
My Lassie."
Karl Heinrich and Lillian Rose
danced a s.erenade valse by Drigo.
Lucy Brown in her_ representaion of
Lack’s Summer Nymph, Olga Chal-
mers illustrating ‘Shackle of War,
and Marie v-Muench as the Slave Girl,
all made a pleasing impression. ‘Sch
Nymphs, by Strauss, danced ensem-
ble by the Heinrich Dancers, and an
illustration of Liszt’s Hungarian Rhap-
sodie No. 2 by Karl Heinrich, -closed
the evening's program.
