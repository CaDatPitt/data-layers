Cheating consequences too simple for some

By Melissa Blackwood,
Paul Kogut,

Chris Lombardo

and Kristen Siegel

For The Pitt News

(Editor’s note: This is the third part of a
three-part series.)

As a University of Pittsburgh professor
listened dumbfounded, a student repre-
sentative on an Academic Integrity Board
began aggressively interrogating the wit-
ness and not the student who was
accused of cheating.

The professor began to wonder just
who was on trial.

‘‘I’ve seen cheating and I didn’t turn the

just dew it 

person in. Why would you?” the represen-
tative asked the witness.

Looking back, the professor said he
feels this question summed up the prevail-
ing atmosphere of the hearing —— that the
person in the wrong was not the student
accused of cheating but the person who
reported it.

He is one of a growing number of Pitt
faculty members who are reluctant to
spend the time and energy pursuing a
cheating student in a system which many
feel too often results in little or no action
being taken against students.

Each college or school at the university
has its own academic integrity board and
holds its own hearings.

Robert W. Comfort, interim dean of

Pitt’s College of General Studies (which
consists of roughly 25 percent of Pitt’s
undergraduates), said about one case
makes it to a hearing every two years in
CGS. W.E. Deskins, the associate dean
and an academic integrity officer for the
College of Arts and Sciences, said about
two cases a semester reach hearings in
CA8, (roughly 55 percent of Pitt’s under-
graduates).

Jack Daniel, vice—provost for Academic
Affairs, reported he did not know how
many cases were heard yearly at the uni-

B versity as a whole, and did not want to try

to estimate.
The system is designed to encourage
professors to deal with matters of cheating

Isaac Walters stands in front of the Dew Crew's massive collection of cans in his Tower A room. The Crew —
Walters, his roommate Jorge Gil and friends Ron Bonacci, Kirk Edleman, Mike Kessler and Jay Demartino (all ﬁrst—
year students) -—- drank and saved a total of 1,632 Mountain Dew cans. Walters said they started saving the cans Aug.
29 to recycle, but then the group got the idea to see how many they could collect over their four years of college
and then recycle. Most of the Crew will be moving into a suite in Sutherland Hall in the fall and will take the collec-
tion of cans with them. Between the six guys, who said they are all Dew addicts, they drink 120 cans a week. The
wall of cans will come down Wednesday of ﬁnals week.

 

Honor
codes  
decrease
cheating,
study
shows

By David Saliba

For The Pitt News

Honor codes have been
found to be the most effective
deterrent to cheating, accord-
ing to a study published March
1993 in Thejournal of Student
Development.

The study found the cheat-
ing rate in schools with honor
codes was 23.7 percent, while
in schools without codes it was
54.1 percent.

Honor code systems range
from policies that require stu-
dents to sign a pledge stating
they will not cheat, to mandat-
ing that students report offend-
ers, to administering unproc-
tored exams.

Although the number of
institutions enforcing honor
codes is rising, they are still a
significant minority. A few
large schools such as the
University of Virginia and the
University of Alabama School
of Medicine have honor codes,
but the majority of universities,
including the University of
Pittsburgh, do not.

Some honor codes, such as
the one at the University of
Virginia, use severe “sanction
systems” that require expulsion
of the student for serious viola-
tions. Other schools try to cre-
ate a positive attitude in stu-
dents and a strong supportive
ground for academic integrity.

Derek Bok, former president
of Harvard University, in his
book University and the
Future of America, describes

Final exam tahes students to the streets of South Oakland

By Tahnee Rygielski

For The Pitt News

Have you ever heard of a
final exam held in the streets of
South Oakland’

Small groups of students walk
around Oakland Avenue,
Centre Avenue and Bouquet
Street nervously waiting for
their final.

As the tension mounts, they
stay alert, knowing that at every
moment a lurking stranger
plans his attack.

t.,

Suddenly, the predator makes
his move. The students quickly
recall the knowledge and tech-
niques learned from their per-
sonal-defense class to fight off
the attacker and ﬂee. 9

In less than a minute, their
exam is over.

To pass this personal—defense

mock—simulation final, students .

must function and act accord-
ingly, said Curtis Smith, a
University of Pittsburgh police

officer and state-certified police

and self—defense instructor who

teaches the personal-defense
class at Pitt.

By walking closely behind the
group, Smith evaluates each
student based on his or her
reaction to the situation.

Smith coordinates the exam
by planting people who are
strangers to the students around
the testing area.

The mock—attackers act
out different dangerous scenar-
ios assigned by Smith.
For example, an attacker may
pose as a purse snatcher or a

rapist.

“We’re told that something is
going to happen, we just don’t
know exactly what or when,”
said Tara Ruggiero, a junior
who took the exam last semes-
ter.

“It is very safe-oriented,” said
Smith. Students do not get hurt;
it’s all pretend.

Before the exam takes place,
Smith teaches the students how
reading into certain situations
can help identify possible
predators.

“The test made me alert of all
the factors in the environment,”
said Ruggiero.

“Being able to spot the attack-
ers made me more prepared to
react when they made their
move.”

Smith explains that his per-
sonal—defense course instructs
students in the most efficient
methods of defeating an oppo-
nent through the use of the
mind and body. ‘

ROTC passes battalion -

ed to cadets who showed excel-
lence in the various forms of
military science throughout the
year. The Ranger Team was rec-
ognized for its efforts that led to
a second-place finish at the
Brigade National Challenge.

Cassetori, the leader of the
battalion, said he was especially
pleased with the Rangers’
efforts.

“Coming in second place, that
was a real accomplishment,”
Cassetori said.

One of the first awards of the
ceremony was presented to the
Cadet Battalion Commander
Gregory Dutka. Dutka received
the Veterans of Foreign Wars
of the USA award, given to
the cadet who has excelled in
military science or an ROTC
activity.

Dutka said he was pleased
with the progress shown by the
cadets this year.

“It is with confidence that I
can say Panther Battalion
accomplished its mission this
year,” he said.

There was a changing of the
guard and a passing of the ﬂags
yesterday at the ROTC Panther
Battalion Inactivation Ceremony
in the Cathedral of Learning.

The inactivation ceremony,
according to Carnegie Mellon
University student Nick
Alexander, is a “combination of
a deactivation of the battalion
and a ceremony [for] the passing
of the battalion flag.”

The ceremony signifies the
closing of the year for the
Panther Battalion, as the flag
gets put away until next fall, and
it is the last ceremony for gradu-
ating cadets before graduation.
Lt. Col. Michael Cassetori was in
charge of the passing of the col-
ors of the ﬂag.

“Ultimately, each person is
closer to their goal of [becom-
ing] a commissioned officer,”
Cassetori said.

In addition to the passing of
the ﬂags, awards were present-

Honor

Continued from page 1
the honor system as perhaps
the most effective approach
in matters of academic
integrity, in that it creates a
sense of community lacking
on many campuses.

“Small homogeneous cam-
puses have generally given
way to large, culturally
diverse institutions which
lack any apparent sense of
community or common pur-
pose among students other
than getting a credential and
a job,” said Bok.

In large universities where
there are large classrooms,
the percentage of students
caught cheating is less than 1
percent. The threat of being
caught and punished signifi-
cantly deterred test cheating
among college students in
smaller colleges.

“The perceived probability
of punishment and the per-
ceived severity of punish-
ment were inversely correlat-
ed with cheating in an honor

code setting,” according to a
study published in The
journal of Higher Education.

As for the perspectives of
the faculty, research has
shown that faculty members
are reluctant to follow “insti-
tutional policies” when they
observe a student cheating;
they prefer to settle the mat-
ter “one-on-one” with the
accused party.

Linda Klebe Trevino, asso-
ciate professor at the Smeal
College of Business
Administration, discussed the
relevance of honor codes in
a study on academic cheat-
ing.

“Whether or not an explicit
honor code exists, academic
dishonesty may depend
upon the sanction system,
particularly how effectively
academic integrity rules and
guidelines are enforced,”
said Trevino.

Cheating

Continued from page 1

on their own, using the hearing
process only as a last resort.
Pitt’s “Guidelines on Academic
Integrity” state that the general
intent is to resolve issues of
cheat-ing at the lowest possible
level.

The guidelines suggest that a
professor first attempt to make
an accused student accept a
specific resolution and sign a
written agreement to that effect.

The agreement typically
includes an admission of guilt
on the part of the student along
with acceptance of a sanction,
usually a failing grade either
for the course or for the particu-
lar assignment or exam
on which the cheating
occurred. A copy is kept on
file in the dean’s office, and
the matter is considered closed.
The form does not go on
the student’s record and is
discarded when the student
graduates or leaves the universi-
ty.

Many faculty members find
this procedure inadequate.

“The problem is that it’s so
easy for kids to withdraw from
the course,” said David
Brumble, an English professor.
If accused of plagiarism or
cheating, “they just walk down

the hall and withdraw.”

Or, as in the case of an assis-
tant professor in CA8, a student
can refuse to sign the agree-
ment.

In this case, the student
denied cheating and the profes-
sor elected to pursue the case

‘since there was a student eye-

witness, the professor and a
teaching assistant had seen the
notes protruding from a note-
book at the student’s feet and
the evidence of phrases on the
exam — answers that matched
the student’s notes verbatim. He
felt he had no choice but to
send the matter to an Academic
Integrity Hearing Board, taking

on the burden of proving her
guilt to a board of faculty,
administration and student rep-
resentatives.

As soon as the hearing began,
the professor said, he had the
feeling that nobody was familiar
with the procedure, he assumed
because it doesn’t occur fre-
quenﬂy.

Despite the fact that universi-
ty guidelines specify that
only persons within the univer-
sity community may question
witnesses, the student’s father
was given the right to question
all -involved. The professor
felt that at least one of the stu-
dent representatives was

“not suited” for the position,
because the student indicated
that it was a bigger crime to
report cheating than to actually
cheat.

A few weeks after the hear-
ing, the professor was informed
that “the case had not been
proven,” and the student was
allowed to withdraw from the
course.

Cases without eyewitnesses
are even less likely to result in
sanctions, or even be brought to
a hearing, as an instructor in the
CGS discovered a few years
ago.

When she graded the tests of
four football players who had

been sitting together during an
exam, she found several dupli-
cate wrong answers, including
one answer with an identical
misspelling on all four exams.
One student confessed immedi-
ately when she confronted him,
but the other three denied any
wrongdoing.

The instructor’s dean discour-
aged her from pursuing the
matter, saying that it was statisti-
cally possible for the four stu-
dents to have identical wrong
answers. The students eventual-
ly were pemiitted to retake the
exam.

Instances such as these have

End of the year   

This year was by no means an uneventful one. From
the Attorney General to the red squirrels, the campus
has seen a lot. Before the year winds down, there are a
few accolades to go to members of the university com-
munity for their accomplishments throughout the year.

The first cheer goes up for the administration for hir-
ing a sexual assault coordinator — finally. Sexual
assault is a serious problem which must be recognized
and dealt with by the campus and new Sexual Assault
Services Coordinator Mary Koch Ruiz is initiating a
peer—training group which many students will hopeful-
ly become involved in. She and everyone else at the
Counseling Center deserve a cheer for their commit-
ment to helping students deal with various problems.

High voter turnout made this one of the more inter-
esting Student Government Board elections. So much
so, that a rush into the Sutherland Hall voting booth
nearly stuffed the president into the ballot box.
However, it was nice to see a broad range of people
running for office; we can only hope they actually act
on their promises.

Increased volunteerism on the part of the students
deserves praise as well. This year saw over $100,000
raised by the Greeks for the Pennsylvania Special
Olympics. The Hand-in-Hand Festival activities, coordi-
nated by the Collegiate YMCA, Pitt Project Tutor and
many other service activities show students do want to
contribute back to their community. Who is it that says
college students are self-centered anyway?

After years of criticizing Food Services, it’s now their
turn to receive some praise. While those who are hav-
ing their first go at Pitt dining may think it doesn’t
stack up against home cooking, Pitt’s old hats will
assure them things have improved. Rumor has it the
Tower C cafeteria may become a food court offering
the “delicacies” of Taco Bell or Burger King.
Convenience stores are also tentatively planned for
Lothrop and Sutherland halls. Here’s hoping that these
ideas actually come to fruition.

Praise also goes out to the Office of Transportation
for the implementation of an expanded shuttle service.
Although crime still seems to be rising, students at least
have a safe way to and from the campus.

And our final praise  the end of the Mount Graham
saga has finally come, deserving three cheers of its
own. As interesting as it was to see six—foot red squir-
rels on the Cathedral Lawn, it’s much more satisfying
knowing that perhaps, just perhaps, students did have
some impact on the decision.

Yes, it has been an exciting year. While this could not
possibly cover all of the weird and wonderful things
Pitt students saw this year, these are our picks as some
of the best.

The tiny city-state of Singapore has been in
the news recently because of the punishment
that will be dealt to an 18-year-old American citi-
zen who lives there with his parents. Michael
Fay was found guilty of 67 acts of vandalism for
spray painting, throwing eggs at cars and tearing
down traffic signs. In America, he would have
been slapped on the wrist, but he is in
Singapore where they actually enforce the laws
and punish criminals. So he was sentenced to
four months in prison, a $2,000 fine and a ﬂog-
ging of six strokes on the bare buttocks with a
bamboo stick by a martial arts expert. This is an
act called caning, and this part of the punish-
ment has been questioned by some in the
United States.

Reaction to the sentence has been mixed in
America. President Clinton, the U.S. State
Department and others have spoken out against

Caning fulfills most basic duty

when they break the law, the government of
Singapore is fulfilling the most basic duty of any
government —— the protection of its people. The
U.S. government has failed that duty and cannot
even provide our citizens with the most basic of
human rights —- to be able to work, live and go
to school in a safe environment.

This fact is not lost on Asian leaders, which is
why America has absolutely no credibility in
Asia when it comes to talking about crime. The
government and people of the United States
must begin to understand just how important
social order and stability are to Asian nations.
This is most certainly true when dealing with
China’s “human rights” situation or when trying
to understand the outrage in Japan over two
more Japanese students being gunned down in
America. 3

For those Americans who are outraged over
this punishment, it should be

it. The harshest denouncement
came from the Human Rights sec-
tion of the State Department who
called the sentence “... cruel,
inhuman and degrading  (NBC

as the United States became more

Clinton protested and was told to

mind his own business. Doesn’t Clinton realize
that Americans no longer have the right of
extraterritoriality while they are overseas?

If there is any case study on earth which clear-
ly and irrefutably shows that deterrence works in
limiting crime, it can be found in Singapore.
Singapore has harsh punishments to deter peo-
ple from committing crimes and disturbing social
order, and its system is working. Two people
per 100,000 are murdered in Singapore; in
Washington, D.C., there are 84 murdered for
every 100,000. Case closed. It is an indisputable
fact that the people of Singapore live in one of
the cleanest, safest and economically vibrant
nations on earth. This is accomplished by
enforcing the laws and not having some liberal
look for the “root causes” of the criminal as we
do in America.

By deterring crime and locking criminals up

liberal during the 1960s, criminals
were coddled and excuses were made for them’
as to why they had committed the crime in the
first place. Today, many psychologists say that
spanking children (ordoing much else to disci-
pline them) will mentally scar them for life. If
this were true, children up until the ‘60s should
have been running wild in the streets since they
were definitely punished severely in most cases.
But they weren’t. They were hard—working, law-
abiding citizens who made America great. Today
we no longer punish children and they are
increasingly committing more and more crimes,
many of them violent. When it comes to control-
ling crime and punishing criminals we need to
learn from nations such as Singapore, not criti-
cize them. If we are too proud to do that, then
at least we can learn from our own history.

Sean Fitzgerald completed 15 of 20 passes for 135 yards in Saturday's Blue-Gold game.

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

Being given a shot to chal-
lenge John Ryan for Pitt’s start-
ing quarterback job is a pretty
good opportunity. Ryan only
threw for 1,284 yards and had
eight interceptions to go with a
paltry six touchdowns last sea-
son. And joining redshirt fresh-

man Pete Gonzalez in attempt-
ing to unseat Ryan is newcomer
Sean Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald must have smelled
a situation ripe for change, com-
ing all the way from California
for the opportunity. He’s a
junior college transfer from Los
Angeles Valley College, where
he threw for 3,100 yards last
year in 11 games.

“I didn’t come for the weath-
er, that’s for sure,” he said. “I’m
here because I wanted to play
with the big boys.”

At 6—feet-4—inches and 210
pounds, he’s the biggest of the
Pitt quarterbacks, taller than
Ryan by an inch and Gonzalez
by three. Fitzgerald is hoping
that in the end he’ll be standing

Ralph Willard, Pitt’s new basketball coach, must have been
salivating like Pavlov’s dog last weekend at the Civic Arena’s
annual Roundball Classic, where some of the nation’s top
high school basketball stars played the Pennsylvania All-
Stars.

The Pennsylvania All—Stars showed that they can play with
the nation’s best, but in the long run, the USA All—Stars had
too much talent as they held off a late comeback to win 119-
113.

Down by 21 points with seven minutes left, the
Pennsylvania All—Stars started bombing three-pointers.

Led by Penn State signee Pete Lisicky, who hit three three-
pointers and had 17 second~half points, and soon-to-be
Temple Owl Johnny Miller, who buried five threes, the
Pennsylvania All—Stars cut the lead to two points — but it
wasn’t enough to overcome the immense talent of team USA.

USA MVP Michael Spruell from Albany, Ga., was just too
much to handle. The 6-foot—2—inch guard went 10-for-13 from
the field and ﬁnished with a game-high 21 points.

Pitt fans could be seeing Spruell in the near future because
he is leaning toward Providence over his hometown Georgia.

Spruell said Pitt tried to recruit him, but he “really liked the
way the Providence coaches approached me in recruiting.”

That’s a huge question for Pitt basketball —— recruits.

So far Pitt has signed no one, and the talent is quickly
being sucked up by other schools. 

The only Roundball player Pitt has the inside track to is 6-4
guard Mosezell Peterson from Ballard High School in
Louisville, Ky. '

Peterson averaged 20 points, nine rebounds and five assists
per game his senior year. Hoop Scoop magazine rates him as
“the No. 1 sleeper in the U.S.”

He was a two—time All-State selection and a USA Today
honorable mention.

In the game, Peterson wasn’t as impressive as his creden-
tials. He went one-for—seven from the field with four points
and four rebounds.

“I like the coach and the coaching staff,” Peterson said of
Willard. “I liked them at Western Kentucky, and I like them
here.”

Peterson was considering Western Kentucky before

From dead octopi to rabid dogs to All-Star cartoon
characters: The Pitt News’ Western Conference preview

By Tom Schneider
Stajf Writer

Bet you thought we forgot the NHL’s Western
Conference. No chance!

#1 Detroit Red Wings vs. #8 San Jose Sharks

Merchandising mania meets the dead octopus fac-
tor.

The Wings, who were more than happy to scoop
up Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman after he was
drummed out of Pittsburgh, have taken ﬂight after a
rocky start to become the Western Conference
favorite. '

Bowman, a pure tactician without equal in the his-
tory of the NHL, has maximized the talents of third-
year sensation Sergei Fedorov to make him a candi-
date for the Hart Trophy. Expect Fedorov and former
Penguin defenseman Paul Coffey to be the keys in
this series. Coffey’s speed is still there, though it has
waned slightly, and it will give the Wings a decisive
edge over the slower Sharks.

San Jose, in just its third season in the NHL, has
done exactly what it needed to do this year in order
to make their first appearance in the playoffs. Under
the sharp tactical skills of U.S.-born coach Kevin
Constantine and the excellent on-ice leadership of
longtime Pens forward Bob Errey, the Sharks
improved by an astonishing 58 points from last year.

The Sharks’ success in this series will hinge on the
performance of Russian-born goaltender Arturs Irbe.
Irbe keyed the Sharks’ stretch run, leading them to a
11-5-5 record in their last 21 games.

An important intangible factor in this series is
scheduling, which differs from all others this year.
The traditional format calls for the two teams to play
games one, two, five and seven at Detroit and games
three, four and six at San Jose. Instead, because of the
amount of travel time involved, they will play games
one and two in Detroit, travel to San Jose for the next
three, and head back to Detroit for the final two if
needed.

This makes the Sharks’ surprising 5-4 game-one
victory in Detroit very important, since three of the
next four games will be played in San Jose.

Even so, the Wings’ overpowering offense should
propel them over the outrnanned Sharks, especially if
this one goes the distance.

Red Wings in seven.

#2 Calgary Flames vs. #7 Vancouver Canucks

This is probably the most difficult series this year to
predict.

The Flames, who have been one of the hottest
teams recently after having struggled through a peri-
od of mediocrity, can go all the way —— if all pistons
are ﬁring.

Goaltender Mike Vernon, who has struggled in the

playoffs along with the rest of the team since its
Stanley Cup season of 1989, will have to be at the top
of his game if the Flames are to prevail.

They will also need steady production from their
big three of Robert Reichel, Theo Fleury and Al
Maclnnis. Maclnnis, who is Calgary’s most consistent
scorer, will need to produce regularly.

Vancouver’s performance, on the other hand, will
depend completely on the play of the Russian
Rocket, Pavel Bure. When Bure is on his game, the
Cliff Ronnings and Russ Courtnalls pick it up a notch
and the Canucks’ offense is nearly unstoppable.
When he is off, or an opposing goaltender is on his
game, the big rig slips out of gear.

The goaltending of Kirk McLean will make the dif-
ference in a close game.

When Bure and the offense are firing on all cylin-
ders, the Canucks are nearly unbeatable — even if
McLean is off and the contest turns into a shootout.
McLean will have to rise to the occasion when the
chips are down if Vancouver hopes to
advance.

This series could go either way, but my guess is
that the Calgary defense won’t be able to hold off
Bure over the course of a seven-game series.

NHL

Continued from page 6
Blackhawks

A battle between the pipes.

Toronto goaltender Felix
Potvin is hands-down the rea-
son the Maple Leafs were able
to finish with the No. 5 seed in
the Western Conference. His
.907 save percentage was one of
the tops among starting NHL
netminders, and his 2.89 goals-
against average in 66 games
showed his durability.

But don’t mail the Stanley
Cup to Toronto just yet —— you
still need to score goals in order
to win a playoff series.

Toronto has little to worry

about in that department, with
the tournament-tough Doug
Gilmour and Wendel Clark
ready to spark the Leafs’ offen-
sive attack. Expect Clark to be
the pivotal player on Toronto's
offense in this series.

For Chicago, the on—again,
off-again play of Ed Belfour will
have to improve.

Belfour is a great goaltender
in the regular season, but come
crunch time, he is not always
100 percent. His streaky perfor—
mance in the 1992 finals against
the Pens was proof positive of
that.

The ‘Hawks improved by

leaps and bounds by making
some big moves before the trad-
ing deadline.

The addition of Tony Amonte,
Gary Suter and Paul Ysebaert
helped them win eight of their
last 12.

In the end, however, the late-
season trades won't make the
‘Hawks any more likely to neu-
tralize the Toronto offense and
solve the riddle of Felix the Cat.

that’s why they brought me

There’s been some buzz
around campus that Fitzgerald

' is the man. He was listed as one

of the top 10 junior college QBs
in the country. But if he’s sup-
posed to be so good, why was
he playing juco?

Well, Fitzgerald did sign with
Idaho State out of high school.
But the coach that recruited him
was fired, and the new guy

threw him in the defensive
backfield.

“I just got lost at free safety,”
Fitzgerald said. “So I decided to
go to JC and play a year down
there.” ,

After the season he had at
Valley, Fitzgerald said that he
was recruited by as many as 15
Division I schools. He says he
narrowed it down to UNLV,
Memphis State, Ole Miss and
Pitt before coming here.

He has had to make adjust—
ments while playing with the
“big boys” for the first time at
Pitt’s spring practice. He said
the tempo of practices is very

quick compared to last year’s,
and so are the receivers.

“The speed of the receivers is
much greater here,” he said.
“And it’s tougher to pick up
defenses.”

And how does Fitzgerald read
Johnny Majors? .

“He’s got everyone in good
spirits, and everyone wants to
turn this program around,” he
said

“And I’m for sure up for
that.”

And all of Pitt would sure be
up if Fitzgerald could bring
3,100 yards to the Panther pass—
ing game.
