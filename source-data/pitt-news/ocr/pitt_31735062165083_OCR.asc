 OnStudcI1ts

/’ The City of Pittsburgh has

”" ‘sentseveral weeks ago, pro-
testing the parking situation

‘prior to the Eucharistic Rally,’

-Sept._30. __ . , p ,
- . David Olbum, fdirector ‘of the f
Department of Public Safety,’

Inspector ‘Thomas Martin of the
Traffic, Division, after making a
' ‘-.‘very thorough investigation,” re-'
'j,_po1.'ted, ‘.‘A1l,o1' the temporary ‘No

_ _Tliur'sday, Sept. 29, and in no area
‘ were’ any such signs posted after

_(__)lbum said. “It would appear
the only persons who might have
become enmeshed in this situa-
tion were those who had parked
their cars at certain points all:
night, and expected them to re-

I. Qlbum said he understands the

“If, in the course of our prepa-
,_1_jat_,ions, some people were incom-
‘_ moded that one day,” he con-
tinued, “that is simply one of the
- /' incidents which must be en-
A countered from time to time in a
if ' congested area.” _ -

In the future Olbum hopes for
more cooperation from‘ the Stu:
dents and faculty so that traffic’
congestion for such “‘1musual”‘
occasions. may be minimized.

_’ _ " Since the Department of Public

» Safety has no power or means ‘to
recall traffic tags after they have
been issued, the matter of the
complaints is one that must be
addressed to the Traffic Court.

their tags as Olbum assured a “fair

It Defense Policy Mappe
        Meeting Held After
Six   Months Delayit

By GORDON CLOWNEY

It took six months, butiﬁnally the University’s
fense Committee met last Thursday to revamp old po'1_1c.
As the result of this meeting, it was decided by the co
mittee to make certain revisions in the present CD pol 55
and then make this policy known throughout the Universi-

community.

In an ‘interview last” Friday with Louis W. H. John
ston, Director of Civil Defense at Pitt, it was learned that th_
committee found the present policy basically sound, but,re‘
ommended certain augmentations before the policy was made‘

Johnston stated that the policy
has not been made public before,
because it has not been sufficiently

was constantly making Changes,

to release an incomplete policy.

V Theodore W. Biddle, Dean of

x should receive the student sup-
port. The student doesn’t fulﬁll
his obligation by just giving to the
zcornmunity Chest, but should also
 give to the Pitt Chest as well.

_ Miss Helen Pool Rush, Dean of

"give is more important than how
much they give. It is important
not only to the Chest, which gets
the money, but also to the stu-
;’.dent giving the money, since this

20- Confused Defense e

If ever an air’ raid [sounds in, on, or about this campus,
walk do not _ run to the nearest exist.’ You won’t know
where to go anyway. But for the beneﬁt of those who Wait,
a’ lot of faculty members and administration -will rush with
signs to the nearest bulletin boards to post-directions.

This is about the extent of-Civil Defense preparation

- that the University of Pittsburgh has now made. Presently,

however, we have beeniinformed, new? policy will be es-
tablished. This is reassuring although. few at‘ the _Uni-

‘ versity seem aware that there ever was an old one.

The “truth of the matter is, Civil Defense is hardly civil
here. - A '

Friday afternoon, the Civil Defense committee, head-
ed by Louis W. H. Johnston, met to talk over CD plans.
Eventually, the news developed that new policy was be-
ing formed. However, neither Dean of Men Theodore Biddle
nor Col. William D. Eister, professor of Military Science
and Tactics, both of whom are on the committee, were
aware of any old policy. Eister, a new member of the group,
told the Pitt News at the end of last semester that, although
he was not aware of any formal University policy, he would
be willing to serve on any committeethat might be estab-
lished _ to develop such necessary coordination.

Biddle stated in informal discussion as ‘late as last
Wednesday that his part on the committee’ was ‘a vague
one. -/ ,

The meeting, however, was originally scheduled to be

I held last May. Because he could not obtain -a quorum, ,

Johnston cancelled it until this month. Six months to or-
ganize an initial coordinating meeting is incredible. It is
a mockery of administration. ' A
Since the semester began, the News has been trying
to contact Johnston to ﬁnd. out "what. is the situation
with Civil Defense procedure. Finally, when the meeting
was called, reporters were not permitted to sit in on it.
The fact that they were permitted to review minutes the
very next day, only to discover that the business conducted
was primarily of an orientativenature, makes the whole
secretive affair ludicrous. - ‘
However, to the committee’s credit, signs have, been
printed and are ready to be posted. But they are being
held back, Johnston’ stated, because arrangements are
yet uncertain. There is no reason to post them where they
can be torn or mutilated until all planning is completed.

_But when the time comes for an air raid, ﬂoor wardens‘

will run out into the hall with them to post them for
student information _ , V
There are lots of wardens, too, we understand. Sixty-
nine men were appointed, last ‘year. Their names are being
kept secret for the unacceptable reason that they should"
not be “bothered” with people who would probably want

to make recommendations to them about procedure. Even‘

these 69 are not certain, this year. Because of staff changes,
some have been moved to floors already designated to

other personnel. But it’s nothing too much to worry about. '

We can be relatively conﬁdent they don’t know what to
do either.

Of.course, we may be building a mountain out of a
mole hill. After all, ﬁghting’s only inthe Middle East, Viet
Nam, and Morocco.

last week’s successful Homecoming celebration.
Now Pittites may see what actually can be ac-

Spirit was high, though slightly wet, at the
game, the PAA attendance on Saturday evening
was spectacular under the reign

and the Varsity Marching Band
was in tip-top shape.

It is evident, however, that
the success of the weekend was
-very much dependent on the pre-
cedin‘g"‘ﬁve days of Greek Week.
Homecoming with its returning
alums was augmented by the
energy ,and skills demonstrated »
by the Greeks in ﬂoats and decorations. ~

Color was present during the entire week be-
cause of the Greek’s clever idea of wearing dinks.
It brought back memories of the past blue and gold
beanies worn last in ’5l. Perhaps this fashion can

Having the ﬂoats viewed before the game was

Trophies, although not going to more than _a
few, were eagerly awaited by all participants. "
Queen Handled Nicely - 
The past week deﬁnitely pointed up ‘the ability

and wisely by the committee in charge. It was so

These subjects, the remaining
ones on study improvement,/and

an explanation of the beneﬁts of

the various extra-curricular ac-
tivities, are presented by instruc-
tors appointed by the Dean of-
Men’s Ofﬁce. -These conference
instructors are assisted by upper-
class counselors, chosen by Men’s
Council.

Starting the ‘ﬁrst week of
school, the new student is beset
by glad handing fraternity men
inviting‘ him to every conceivible
type of social event, making plans
to attend all the big ‘ football
games, and trying to date every
pretty female they have a class
with.

The conference program at-
tempt to keep the student’s mind
on the fact that everything has
its place, but attention to class-
work, especially during the ﬁrst
weeks, is imperative. It also pro-
vides a reliable source of infor-
mation concerning p r-o b 1 e ms
which theinewcomer may incur
during his ﬁrst semester.

.-Poor Orientation Elsewhere

Most colleges, and universities
conduct an orientation week that
immediately precedes the open-
ing of school, in which‘they»at-
tempt to hurriedly cover all the
topics\n,oW being introduced in
the conference’s semester pro-
gram. So‘ it can readily be seen

Robert Mitchum plays the in-
famous Preacher Powell, whose
hands are tattooed “Love” and
“Hate,” in the Penn’s current bill,
“The Night of the Hunter,” does
perhaps his ﬁnest acting ever un-
der Director Charles Laughton.
Laughton turned Renoriresque
after the - French cinemaestro,
makes a" much-needed camera

study in modern American cin-

ematography, which has been
crying for an “art” crusader for
quite a long while noyv.

“The Night ofpthe Hunter” is
healthfully conscious of many
almost-forgotten movie effects,
such as creating a fantastic
dream-world in this world’s real-
ity_ through contrast in depth
and texture of closeups, in light
and shadow play, and inverted
perspective as when the grizzled
old boat captain (James Gleas-
on) stares in horror down into
the quiet water, seeing Wi1la’s
blond-haired corpse.

Most of these effects as well
as the experimenting in scene
cuts by blacking out to a pin-

point, bringing in closeups of ‘

In addition to Swarts and

 Saturday

, Coach Leo Bemis’ Booters travel
‘. to Leechburg Saturday in an effort
A to notch win number six of the
, current campaign at the expense
of,-Franklin & Marshall.
 The F & M booters, who were

defeated last ,year by the Pan-
»'i_ thers, should be victims today if
"the Pittites follow the precedent
they have set to date.‘The Blue and
“Gold have been unable to win
"‘_m"ore than two in a row all year
‘and the win over Denison was
5-number one following a loss to
'Navy. 9 
 The Bemismen, who have
(been able to win only one out
of four games played away
from home this campaign, may
be without the services of Mike
Culhane this Saturday. The big
center halfback has been unable
_ to take time from his dental
’ studiesto make road trips. His
absence from the lineup was
-' considered a contributing factor
‘ "in the losses to Duke, North Car-
« olina State , and Navy.

H’-lbe practically the same lineup that
V?«,;.,began the ‘campaign. Bob Cherry,
nthough, may move from left _in-
side to take Culhane’s spot at cen-
ﬂter -halfback if Culhane doesn’t
make the trip.

' Upon further checking, it was
found that the commotion was
caused when the selecting seers
ﬁnally cleared up their crystal
balls and came up with Toug-
aloo over Tuskegee in the “Game
of the Weak.” V -

An interesting election took
place among the seers of the
select circle when the swamis

‘voted on whether to permit
Rosemary Ray, who replaced
Rothman last week, to take over

_Rothman’s spot permanently.

The election wasn’t even
close since 44 nays andtwo ayes
were cast. There has been some
speculation as how 46 votes were
cast when only four yogis were
voting. Rumor has it that Arom-
atorio and Butchock (both top-
ped in the selections by Rose-
mary last week) were seen mad-
ly stutﬁng the ballot box.

Aromatorio and B u t c h o'c k
deny this rumor vehemently,
however. As Butchock says,
“Just because we put extra~v6tes
in doesn’t mean anything except
that we’i-.e patriotic.” . Aroma-
torio commented, “Merely doing
our duty.”

A slight shakeup in the yogi
standings took place when the
results of three games played
earlier this year ﬁnally reached
this department. The Pitt News
special messenger who was
bringing in the results got mixed
in onthe way with a cross—coun-

which he wasn’t even entered

,lWo’man orgotten in Italy, Honored Here

Mural Hangs in Hall

The University’s Italian Classroom has rekindled a spark
of pride which has lain dormant off and on over a period of
300 years in Italy. This has been accomplished by Mrs. Ruth
Crawford Mitchell, National Rooms Program Chairman.

During Mrs. Mitchell’s trip abroad this summer, she
visited the University of Padova where Elena Lucrezia Cor-
naro Piscopia, the first woman to be admitted anywhere

to a school of higher education,¢

received a doctorate in philosophy
in 1678. Anxious to see the statue
of the woman whose mural
adorns the Italian Classroom, Mrs.
Mitchell inquired of a graduate
student of the University the site
of this monument.-

His unfamiliarity with its loca-
tion wasn’t so surprising as was
his curiosity as to whom Miss
Piscopia was. ,

Student Accompanies

Accompanied by the Italian stu-
dent, Mrs. Mitchell found the
image of Elena Piscopia at the
base’ of a stairway, covered with
pigeon feathers and wont of the
care usually ‘tendered a famous

\‘

personality. _
These unexpected and certain-
ly not anticipated incidents

prompted further investigation
by the Nationality Rooms’ chair-
man. From the University she
went to the Basilica of the Bene-
dictine Fathers of Saint Gius-
tina, where the remains of Elena
Piscopia were buried in a chapel. ,
Mrs. Mitchell found the chapel
in great disorder, strewn with
papers. ' '
At this point, Mrs. Mitchell in-
quired of Reverend P. D. Timoteo
Campi, abbbt of Saint Giustina, if
she may read the biography of
the ﬁrst woman laureate of the

-world. Reverend Campi admitted

that though they had realized the
signiﬁcance of Miss Piscopia’s
biography, actual work had not
begun on it. - /; '
Received Letter

.. Last month Mrs. Mitchell re-
ceived a letter from the abbot
advising her that research on the
biography had begun, and that
Mrs. Mitchell would be the ﬁrst

In their trips to Italy, Mrs.
Mitchell, individual members of

scholarship students of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh have left
an awareness in Italy that, though
the honor and tribute due the ﬁrst
woman laureate wasn’t recognized
by her own Italian neighbors, the
signiﬁcance of Elena Lucrezia
Cornaro Piscopia’s accomplish-
ment is preserved in the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh ‘within a mural

7Former Pitt Prof’s Wife
Commits Suicide Sunday

The pages of University

history were turned back 21

years last Sunday, with the news of a New England suicide.
Victim was the wife of a former Pitt professor, whose ﬁring
in 1934 from the school created a blackmark on Pitt which

lasted until 1945.

Returning from a trip abroad Sunday, Ralph Turner, a

history professor here from 1925 to 1934, found his

old wife dead in their New Haven,
Co_nn., apartment. With death
caused by poison, Mrs. Turner had
left a note nearby, but the con-
tents were undisclosed.
Fired by Bowma1

But this is not the iirst time that
the Turner name has been in the

news. ,
Back in 1934 Dr. Turner be-
p came the center of a controversy

when he was fired by then-
Chancellor John G. Bowman.
' Chancellor Bowman attributed

the dismissal to the professor's
“irreverent" attitude.

Students — who had voted
Turner their most popular pro-
fessor—also protested his outser.
and a. legislative committee in-

After his dismissal, the doctor

' headed a CIO/school in Washing-

versity of Minnesota, worked for
the Government and later became
