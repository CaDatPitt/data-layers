Carlson Announces Final

Hospitalization Extension

Students Must Sign-up, Pay $2.50

Second Semester Fee by Monday

Declaring that Monday will be the ﬁnal extension of the deadline
for payment of hospitalization insurance fees, Dr. H. C. Carlson, director
of the Men’s Student Health service, has issued what he called “his last

appeal to the student body to sign up.”
Dr. Carlson described the hospitalization plan as a measure designed
to further the student health program on campus, and one which has

given the student health service a
greater etﬁciency in the checking of
serious illness than ever before
known.

The policy fee for the second
semester is $2.50, payable in the
treasurer’s oﬁice, in State hall. New
signees, as well as those already
protected under the plan, will be
accepted for the second semester,
Dr. Carlson emphasized.

The plan, introduced on campus
last spring, by the Pitt News and
the Student Health service, provides
21 days of hospitalization during ill-
ness inany of Pittsburgh 25 largest
hospitals, in addition to several
other beneﬁts.

Other services offered by the plan
are:

(1) _Use of the operating room
as often as necessary.

(2) Anesthesia as often as neces-
sary.

The above points are outstanding

, beneﬁts in the University plan, Dr.

Carlson points out, since many other
hospitalization plans call for the
use of the operating room and anes-
thesia equipment but once during
the course of a conﬁnement.

(3) Ordinary drugs and medica-
tions.
(4) Necessary dressings and
casts.
(5) Routine laboratory services.
(6) Ordinary x-ray.

Officials Deny
Pitt Produces
Excess Smoke

Accusations of smoke violations by
the University in an information
from the city health director’s of-
ﬁce were discounted Wednesday
when faculty members and per-
sons of the buildings and grounds
department pointed out that the
University doesn’t supply all of its
own heat.

In a page one story, the Pitts-
burgh Sun-Telegraph on Tuesday

named the University as one of the ..

14 commercial buildings and plants
that were chronic violators of the
city’s 60 per cent black smoke or-
dinance. The Post-Gazette on Wed-
nesday named the 14 violators but
the University wasn" listed among
them. The Press did not run the
story.

Steam heat for the Cathedral,
Foster memorial, Heinz Chapel, and
Mellon institute is supplied by the
Belleﬁeld Boiler plant, located
under the Schenley bridge in Schen-
ley park. This plant supplies steam
heat also for the Carnegie museum
and library and Phipps conserva-
tory. Although the plant uses soft
coal, it puts only very light smoke
into the atmosphere, on account of
the adequate process of re-burn-
ing the coal, plant officials ex-
plained.

Heat for Thaw hall, State hall,
Alumni hall, Old Mellon institute
and other University buildings on
the upper campus is supplied by
boilers in Thaw hall. By proper
steam engineering, smoke is con-
trolled so that no soot contaminates
the atmosphere. Nearest building
to the University that was actually
named in the information was the
Medical Arts building, Fifth avenue.

The smoke ordinance, dragged out
of dormancy for the current anti-
smog campaign, forbids commer-
cial buildings producing smoke
greater than 60 per cent black. Most
Oakland buildings are well within
the limit.

Panther Squad
Battles Staters

Seniors Bid Farewell
To College Basketball

The greatest Pitt basketball team
in six years reaches the end of a

triumphant season tomorrow night
on the Penn State court.

Shooting for their seventh straight
win, Pitt’s ﬁghting Panthers will be
out to stretch their record to 13 vic-
tories and four defeats, and to add
the Penn State pelt to their victory
string for the second time this sea-
son.

Doc Carlson’s all-senior starting
ﬁve, reaching the climax of a some-
times brilliant basketball cam-
paign, romps out against the hot-
and-cold Lions, conﬁdent of stop-
ping Johnny Barr and company as
neatly as they stopped the burly
Staters earlier in the season. And
the Panthers will be a sharper bas-
ketball machine tomorrow night
than they were the night they rush-
ed John Lawther’s boys all over the
court to roll up a 36-27 victory.

Starting for the Panthers tomor-
row for the last time in their col-
lege careers are Eddie Straloski,
Mel Port, Sam Milanovich, George
Kocheran, and Jimmy Klein, ﬁve
boys, who have progessed from er-
ratic sophomore “wonders” to smart-
passing, hard-ﬁghting seniors cap-
able of holding their own with any
college quintet in the country.

Scoring leader for Pitt is little
Ed Straloski, long-range pitcher
who has led the Panther assault on
enemy baskets for the past two

‘You Can’t Be Very

These YW girls are insistent.

One of them hustled into the

little article,” describing the
YWCA “cocoa. live;” an innocuos
cocoa and cakes party to be held
this afternoon from 3:30 until 5
o’clock in the YW office on the
twelfth ﬂoor.

We said it’s hard to be clever
about cocoa parties.

“Not this one,” she beamed, “just
say we’re calling it the cocoa. jive,
because we love cocoa and cakes
instead of java and tea, like in the
popular song.”

Questions on University Policy

Queries Submitted by Student Body
Will Feature Assembly i11 Memorial

\Vhcn the stuclent. body gathers in Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Me-
morial hall at 10 :40 o’clock this morning, Chancellor John G. Bow-
man .will answer the questions on Uiiivcrsity policy which are
uppermost in the miiuls of the men and women attending Pitt.

Dr. Bowman will answer as many questions as time permits
from the list subniittcd by students and a1'1'a1iged in order of their
importance as determined by Student-Faculty association poll.

Third hour classes will not meet to permit every student to attend

the assembly.

Because Dr. Bowman’s talk will
continue only until the end of the
third hour, students have been asked
to assemble in the hall as soon as
possible to permit a maximum pe-
riodpduring the third hour for the
chancellor to answer the questions.

Following a brief introduction
by Joseph Roberts, BA41, SFA pres-
ident, Dr. Bowman ﬁrst will answer
the question concerning plans for a
student union building.

According to the tabulations of
the poll taken by the SFA statistics
committee, this question received
the most votes and is therefore of
primary interest to most students.

Questions concerning the percent-
age of the student education cost
that comes from appropriation, en-
dowment, and tuition will be an-
swered next and the future of fra-
ternities on campus will be the third
topic discussed by Dr. Bowman.

Plans for dormitories on camp-
us, function and responsibility of
administration, including student
government, and alumni relations
are some of the subjects which the
chancellor will discuss if time per-
mits.

Other questions on the list to be
answered by Dr. Bowman concern
possibility of increase of student
activity funds, at Commons room
lounge, University good will as
manifested through students, ﬁ-
nancing of nationality rooms, and
the administrative opinions in re-
gard to athletics.

The importance of the order of
questions on the list was determin-
ed by the number of votes received
by each question on a questionnaire
circulated by the statistics com-
mittee.

Items on the questionnaire were
taken from questions submitted to
the dean of men’s office by any stu-
dent who turned them in, and from
subjects gathered by SFA members
in discussion with students
throughout the University.

After the poll was taken, per-
centages of the votes received by
each question were tabulated and
the questions were listed accord-
ingly.

Dr. Bowman, at the request of
the SFA which also asked for the
assembly today, addressed the en-
tire student body in February of
1938. He also spoke in November
of that year.

Dr. Cleven Attends
New York Conclave

Dr. Andrew N. Cleven, professor
of history, is attending the first in-
ternational conference of the School
of the Air of the Americas being
held in New York today and to-
morrow.

The Columbia broadcasting sys-
tem and the National Education As-
sociation of the United States are
sponsoring the conference with the
cooperation of the Pan-American
union.

The purpose of the meeting, ac-
cording to Dr. Cleven, is to facili-
tate wider and more effective utili-
zation of these broadcasts through-
out the western hemisphere in sup-
plementing the classroom instruc-
tion of American children.

Bowman Answers
Following Queries

Questions concerning the follow-
ing topics will be answered in
order by the chancellor during the
SFA assembly third hour today:

1. Immediate plans for a stu-
dent union building.

2. Percentage of student educa-
tion cost that is derived from ap-
propriation, endowment, and tui-
tion.

Debate Team
To Meet Case

The debating team of the Case
School of Applied Science from
Cleveland, Ohio, will meet the Uni-
versity team this morning at 9:30
o’clock in 229 Cathedral to debate
the question “Resolved: That a per-
manent union of the nations of the
western hemisphere should imme-
diately be established.”

Fred Roth, Ed4l, and Irwin Ros-
en, C43, will represent the Uni-
versity, upholding the negative
side of the debate.

Approximately 50 delegates from
four district schools assembled on
campus yesterday afternoon to take
part in the round of debates, ac-
cording to Samuel Rodgers, C41,
who presided at the assembly held
at 1:30 o'clock in the Cathedral.

The schools represented were
Carnegie Tech, Mt. Mercy, Geneva,
and PCW, as well as our varsity
and freshmen debate squads.

This is the first time the Univer-
sity debaters have deviated from a
formal debate presentation while
on campus. The large number of
participants engaging in the discus-
sion indicated that they would have
to abandon the formal presentation
of arguments and substitute the
convention type, or discussion from
the floor. Rodgers explained that
the plan has met with repeated suc-
cess elsewhere.

Cap & Gown’ s Edward A. Morgan Praises George H yde’ 3 Script
Talks About Vauideville Circuits, Song Writing, Ballet Dancing

. By or-zoacm snvsrr

Cap and Gown"s new director,
Ed Morgan, looked out the window
of his eighth ﬂoor office, but he
didn’t see the gray buildings and
the trafﬁc speeding from Fifth
avenue.

He was seeing “the old days”——-
the years he spent in vaudeville,

re time he and his pals brought
three songs to New York in hopes
of having them published.

“At eight o‘clock in the morning
we were waiting at the door of a
publishing house. We waited all
right—-until one in the afternoon,"
Ivlr. i‘./lorgan. declared. “Those
places don't open their eyes till
about twelvei”

The tall, gray-haired director
from Springﬁeld, Mass., went to
Harvard, class of ’22, but had to

drop out during his second year,
upon the death of his father.

He never thought much about
show business until 1922, when he
turned toward Broadway, and
danced for three years in Shubert
units and Fox vaudeville circuits.

One of his best friends during
this time was Ralph Sanford, who
danced for some time as Ray Bol-
ger's partner.

l\Iorgan’s vocation consists of
operating a dancing school in Hart-
ford, Conn.

His partner in this venture is one
Anatole Bourman, whose back-
ground in ballet dates from his days
in the Imperial Ballet school in Pe-
trograd. where he was a classmate
of the famous Nijinsky.

“Anatole is a typical Russian,”
Mr. Morgan said. grinning. “As a

matter of fact, I was reminded of
him when I read one of the lines
in this book of George Hyde’s
we’re going to put on, which, inci-
dentally, is a very well-written mu-
sical comedy.”

The gag he referred to is the line
a Russian character speaks in the
production: “Let's not talk about me
any more. Let’s talk about you.
How do you like it 3; new ballet?”

In 1934. Mr. Morgan was asked
to write and direct the first Am-
herst—Smith-Mount Holyoke com-
bined production, and the show met
vcith such a favorable reception that
in 1936 he wrote and produced a
second show for them.

"We had some pretty snappy ac-
tion in those dance scenes,” he ce-
called, “There's a score of rivalry
existing between Smith and Mount

Holyoke, and we used to have the
girls dancing in a kind of competi-
tive fashion. They were on their
toes. all right.”

Last year he had published a song
entitled “A Little Cape Cod Cot-
tage,” and lately he has been writ-
ing special material for Frank
Crumit and Julia Sanderson, who
have used some 30 of his songs.

When asked how one goes about
writing a song, the amiable show-
man expiained that the idea's the
thing.

"You have to have a darn good
idea. and then it has to be set up
right,” he explained. “A lot of
high-salaried song-writers today,
however, are writing music and ly-
rics with direct steals from other
hits. I wouldn't recommend that
method though."

A Little Light
On the Subject

WHEN CHANCELLOR Bowman steps to
the microphone in Memorial Hall this morning
for the Sl’+‘A-sponsored "Information Please.” he
will make an appearance long anticipated by the
Pitt student body.

His position will diifer from that of the com-
panions oi’ quizman Fadiman because he will be
supplied in advance with the questions. But
there should be little doubt that he ﬁlls the bill
as  “expert," for no man is better qualiﬁed to
inform the students on the speciﬁc problems that
will be presented.

Long criticized for lack of personal Contact
with his studerts. Dr. Bowman. at the request of
the 1937-38 Senior court, has since rebuffed this
charge by meeting with student groups in week-
ly informal teas. These ﬁreside chats have been
noted for their astonishing frankness. And it is
expected that the same spirit will prevail at this
morning’s chat.

According to the SFA statistics committee,
the most important question in Pitt student
minds concerns the plans for a student union.
We have a hunch that Dr. Bowman will not only
say that such plans do exist but we think he
will elaborate and describe in detail what the
administration has in mind.
~ '1 He will probably spend some time on this
question, because, We feel sure, he is sincerely
interested in it. I__f.j-for _, no other reason, the
Chancellor has an""able exponent in this ﬁeld
in: the person of University, provost Rufus H.
Fitzgerald, one. of the country’s leading author-
ities on student unions..;,_

‘f; Placing second in the SFA poll was the ques-
tionconcerning whatmoney goes where. This
will probably be dismiss'ed with a few, curt state-
ments of facts. Something like this:

Q. ‘ Wh-at- is the division of the cost of educa-
tion?

A. According to this year’s report of G.
Stanley Rupp (assistant treasurer and bursar of
the University) published last month in the
magazine Pitt and the Pitt News, here’s the set-
up: student tuition and fees, 61.8%; state appro-
priations, 23.8’/é; endowments and gifts, 9.275.;
sundry, 5.2’,

We are especially interested in the question
dealing with the function and responsibility of
the V€ll.‘TlC)?..lS administrative offices, from the
Board of 'l‘rustees down to student government.

Thor is a hazy student conception of what
the oiiice of chancellor entails, what the provost
does, what duties are associated with the sec-
retary’s office; student government notwith-
standing. Neither orientation classes nor pub-
lic statements have presented a clearly-defiined
e>:plana'tio_n of the spheres of authority.

It may be that these lines of responsibility
have not yet been. set up and it may be that even
if tliey are, the entire matter is not of much im--
portance to the average student. We don’t know.
In fact, we don’t lmow whether we students have
a righ to know the detailed duties of the ad-
mini strative oﬂices.

V\7e’ll settle for simply Dr. Bowman’s frank
opinion on the _place of student government at
Pitt.

It  for thi:-: that we  listen. attentively
at 10:40 this inorn:in_g in Memorial Hall. I

\Vhithe1' Are
We Whence?

As it must to all men, death may soon over-
come lots and lots of Americans, 21 to 36.

The next few months may reveal whether
(if the weather is good over the North sea) Ger-
many wins the war before September, or (if
the weather is bad) whether the war drags on
for a few years with Anglo—American victory.
The American Choice on the question “Where
Do We Go From Here?” may mean New Direc-
tions in the New World accompanied by Chang-
ing Patterns in International Economic Rela-
tions. (Reading these four books by Wallace,
Laski, Berle, Feis, would make good activity.)

However, foreign and domestic military-dip-
lomatic—economic policy in the many months to
come will, on the whole, be decided by the State
department, the President, and his advisers. The
American Choice today should not be one of
“discussing” policy, either in forums, or edi-
torials, but rather a choice deciding upon: (1)
study in detail of world history, 1914-1939; (2)
trying to assemble uncensored information on
world history, 1939-1941; (3) using under-the-
skin-tactics of embarrassing policy-discussers
through pointed questions revealing weaknesses
in knowledge or reasoning.

The purposes of the above program, for stu-
dents especially, are to (1.) furnish a real back-
ground; (2) provide the public with a skepticism
as to the inevitability of being led by principles
of economics-politics—socic-logy, by events, or by
leaders.

For those genuinely interested, this program
will consume all the energies put forth. But
fEn.di_ng those genuinely interested, we believe, is
like hunting for the needle.

Phi Gams Outlast Kappa Sigs;
Phi Kappa Crushes SAE Five

Forfeits last Tuesday hit the only
sport that had been unblemished
in Fraternity competition, as the
Delts, Theta Chi, and the Sammies
won the easy way in basketball
competition over the Pilams. Sigma
Chi, and Lambda Chis, respec-
tively.

The best game of the few that
were played was the one in which
the Phi Gams, although victorious,
25-20, were almost upset by the un-
predictable Kappa Sigs. The Kap-
pa Sig’s quintet, which has been ice

been cut from the game. they
might have been conquerers, not
conquered.

Bob Quick played a good game
for the Phi Gains and his five ﬁeld
goals copped top scoring honors.
Delle Donne stood out for the Kap-
pa Sigs, but the Phi Gams‘ defence
tightened. in the crisis and his ef-
forts were in vain.

The second place Phi Kaps were
recipients of another honor as they
amassed the highest team total of
the season in beating SAE, 62-14.

The Phi Kaps dependable star,
Jack Glenn, scored 11 ﬁeld goals and
three fouls for the highest individ-
ual point making of the season.

Poorest game of the evening was

years. Number one play—make1
and ball-hawk is Mel Port, red-
headed, poker-faced ﬁghter whose
specialty is breaking up enemy
plays, turning them into scores for
Pitt.

Sam Milanovich, rugged defen-
sive star and cool-headed passer;
Jimmy Klein, sometimes spectacu-
lar shot-maker; and George Koch-
eran, aggressive little ﬂoorman
whose sudden spurt, paced the
Panthers home stretch drive, round
out the Carlson quintet.

Key man in the Penn State at-

tack, neatly side-tracked by the
fast-moving Panthers in the first
Pitt—State battle, is captain Johnny
Barr, big Lion forward.

With Barr, forward Red Moffat,
and gangling center Herky Balti-
more rolling up the points, coach
John Lawther’s gang has compiled
a highly respectable record of 11
victories and ﬁve defeats.

Both Pitt and Penn State have
had their ups and downs this sea-
son, one State low point being a hu-
miliating 35-21 defeat by West Vir-
ginia, but comparative records point
to another win for Pitt.

Pitt Track Team Shoots
For ICAAAA Laurels

g By BEN room:

Coach Carl Olson’s talented
spil~:e-<.vea1‘ei's have been declared.
the team to beat in tomorrow’s an-
nual ICAAAA indoor champion-
ships at l‘./ladison Square garden, ac-
cording to track experts Jesse
Abramson and Art Daley of the New
York Times and Tribune, respec-
tively.

The list of contenders has been
narrowed to Pitt, NYU, and Ford-
ham, but of these Pitt has more
certain scorers han either of the
other two teams. A great Fordham
mile relay team and the Violets’
Les MacMitchell overshadow any
Pitt individuals, but neither of the
two Metropolitan schools boasts the
all-around strength of the Panth-
ers.

Practically Unanimous

Abramson has worked out a pos-
sible scoring chart that gives the
Pitt team 24 points and each of the
others exactly the same. The usu-
ally conservative Olson gives his
Charges 28 points. The News prog-
nosticator, who has seldom gone
wrong, sees the Pitt team winning
with about 30 points.

When Dusty Rhoades and Red
Jessup both soared 13 feet 6%
inches at Michigan last Saturday,
they easily leaped into the favor-
ites’ slot in that event. No Eastern
college man has yet gone past 13
feet. With ﬁrst plac: scoring ﬁve
points and second place four points
these junior pole vaulting stars
should get the Panthers nine points.
Carter to Score Twice

The other famous funior twins,
Hap Stickel arid Bill Carter, may
possibly upset Barney Ewen in the
60-yard‘ sprint, but there isno rea-
son in the wide world‘ why they

shouldn‘t at least take second and
third and net seven points.

Carter also is a broad jumper of
no mean ability and his leap of 22
feet 111/4 inches last Saturday must
put him in at least second position.
Again he has a chance to upset
Ewell in the event, but four points
is enough to give ililll here.

The senior half-miler, who has
come along so fast in the last few
\v<:cl:r., Del Anderson, figures to
surprise even the New York scribes
in the 600. They rate him no bet-
te: than ﬁfth, but if he keeps on
clipping oil" seconds, with the speed
he has he must be rated. at least
third, netting him three points.

Dave McDowell is capable of
scoring third in the high jump, thus
adding three points to the Pitt total.
Zeke Sterner can score two points
and fourth place in the two-mile
if he runs no better than he did last
Friday at Michigan. These points
would swell the Pitt total to 28.
Newman May Count

For the remaining two points,
there are at least three possible
sources. Joe Newman, senior high
hurdler, skimmed over the 50-yard
tall timbers in 6.6 seconds last Tues-
day, the best time of his career. If
he is in the same form Saturday,
he should place.

The mile relay team, although
striving for its ﬁrst good perform-
ance, has the talent to place. Stickel,
Regis Larkin, Bud Graf, and cap-
tain Larry Tregoning will probably
run in that order. Bill Benghauser
also is possible place winner in the
shot put, but he's having his de-
ferment discussed with his local
draft board this Saturday and may
not be able to- make the trip to New
York.

Fraternities Postpone
Scheduled Pledging

Pledge night. the formal induc-
tion of the new men into fraternity
life. which was scheduled Wednes-
day evening was postponed to last
night.

Reason for the postponement, ac-
c-ording to Robert R. Corley, assist-
ant dean of men, was lack of time
for making proper fraternity pledge
contacts. Pledges had to be notiﬁed
of their acceptance by the various
fraternities by mail, rather than by
personal interview, necessitating
the one-day delay in the pledging
ceremonies. The list of pledges will
appear in Monday’s News.

Phi E ps Busy

Last Saturday night the Phi Epsi-
lon Pi pledges threw their annual
dance for their fraters. In keeping
with President Roosevelt's defense
program the dance had a nautical
(not naughty) theme. The fun took
place midst anchors, yachting ban-
ners, ﬂsh nets. and sailor hats. As
a remedy for seasickness, the sailors
were treated to ice-cream and cake.
On a more serious note, last week
the actives elected their olﬁcers for
the current year as follows: super-
ior, Jay Silverberg (reelected); vice-
superior, Bob Colton; quarterly rep-
resentative, Alex Zelenski; corre-
sponding secretary, Allen Gould;
and recording secretary, Martin R0-
