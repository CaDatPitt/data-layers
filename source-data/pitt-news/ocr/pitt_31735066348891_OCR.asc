“70 Years of Collegiate Joumalism ” —

Tﬂiljeiattt ﬁrms

University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa. ‘

Vol.70, No. 5

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

A coalition of student leaders has

‘called for the resignation of

Athletic Director Casimir Myslin-
ski, charging he misrepresented
the alledgedly critical shortage of
seating for this season’s home
football games. _ _

The leaders, including the heads‘
of Student Government (SG), the
Interfraternity Council (IFC), the
Panhellenic Society, the Black

_ ction Society and other groups
'  ‘ ,, id Myslinski lied about the status

of seating for the Notre Dame game
when he claimed it was sold out.

Myslinski denied any intentional
fraud on his part to misrepresent

MYSLINSKI

the seating situation for the Notre
Dame game. ,

The sellout of the contest was
citeb as an indication by some
administrators, including Myslin-
ski, that some form of controlled
allocation of football seats way
necessary.

According to members of the
student coalition, tickets to the
Notre Dame game were available
for sale last Friday, despite
Myslinski’s report of a sellout,
leading to the call for his
resignation.

“When we have requests for
more seats in the stadium than we
have, it’s considered a sellout. '1
froze a number of seats in Section
11 so as to provide myself some
ﬂexibility.

“I wasn’t attempting to hide
those seats. Section 11 goes to.the
general public. It has nothing to do

‘with student seats.’ ’ .

A sellout does not mean_ every
seat in the stadium‘ is taken,
according to Myslinski, but means
that the number of requests for
seats equals the supply.

.The resignation demand came

after a student discovered Friday

that tickets were still on sale for the
Notre Dame game.

“The rationale for the coupon
distribution system no longer
exists,” said Student Government
President Larry Platt. “Apparently
Dr. Posvar’s administrators are
lying to him, or heis lying to the
students. There is no need for the
coupon system.” _

The meeting of student leaders
Sunday evening resulted in seven
demands arising from ‘Myslinski’s
alleged misrepresentation:

--Human Concern Group

Disbands in Confusion

BY VALERIE STRUBLE

The Council of Human Concern
(CHC) recommended its termina-
tion to the Senate Council at last
Monday's meeting following three
years of frustration, inaction and
disagreement. .

The Cl-IC was created as an ad
hoc council of the Senate during a
Special Senate Meeting on Racism
in l973, to study racism at Pitt in its
hiring policies, admission stan-
dards, curriculum and ﬁnancial aid

.510 minorities. It was meant to look

"into the issues raised by protesting
black Southern University students
killed by Louisiana ‘National
Guardsmen in November, 1972.

But. according to Senate Clerk
Eva Brosius. “the CHC never got
off the ground."

“We accomplished absolutely
nothing," said CHC member
Cynthia Vanda. “We never
decided how the council would
function. We never knew what
authority we had. We were unsure
of our responsibilities."

“And, no one came to the
meetings. If we did agree on an
action, there weren't enough

-{ ~v~-‘people present to implement it,"
4 "Vanda said.

A CHC member who wished to
remain unidentiﬁed blamed the

, administration tor the sluggishness

a

of the council. “The administra-
tion tried to control the CHC by
appointing vest-pocket liberals,"
he said. “There were sincere
people who really wanted to
investigate and solve the problems,
but the administration controlled
the resources we needed to do it."

In March, 1974, the Senate

Council voted to continue the CHC-

for another year and added the
investigation of sexism to its
jurisdiction. But the uncertainty
and confusion continued, and at
some meetings only two or three

_ members were present. Letters of
resignations cited other commit-
ments, and the CHC dwindled to a
few dedicated members.

“We decided we had not carried
out the charter the Senate had
created and sent letters to the other
members about discontinuing the
CHC. The few responses we got
were in favor of deactivating the
council, and no response was taken
to be agreement," Vanda said.

The Senate Council agreed to
consider the reommendation to
discontinue the CHC and to discuss
possible alternatives for dealing

with the problems of racism and.

sexism at Pitt. Its decision is
expected to be ready for the next
Senate Council meeting on October
l3.

between students and administra-
tion will be weakened because. of
deceit.”

  Dorm Escort Plan DeI<=ve<’

BY BOB MAYO

The full implementation of the
new security system in Pitt dorms
has been postponed indeﬁnitely,
according to Ofﬁce‘ of Residence
Life
Woodson Gibbs.

The deadline for the system was
slated for today, but Gibbs said it
may take-two to three weeks before
all facets of the system. are in full
operation. A ~

After missing one deﬁnite target
day, “it’s hard to set a second
date,” Gibbs said, indicating it
would be better to speak of the
length of the postponement in more
general terms. T

Gibbs outlined four problems
that hindered the system from
moving into full swing today. They
were a wire shortage for ‘electric
security doors, lack of adequate

phone lines to implement the escort’:

system, the need for 200 more
students to be photographed for
identiﬁcation cards, and a delay in
receiving meal ticket card stickers

that would identify which dorms’

students live in.

.Fire,exit doors in the Towers are
being equipped with electric locks
that will open only with the
sounding of a ﬁre alarm. This
move is meant to prevent intruders
from using the doors to gain access
to the dorms and bypass security
guards.

The assistant director also said A
the phone lines necessary to make,

calls to rooms to clear visitors were
not yet installed. Regular “long
lines" were undesirable because
the frequent use would tie them up.
Private phone installation has been
receiving priority.

An estimated 200 students were
not a part of the regular dormitory
meal plan and did not have meal
ticket identiﬁcation. Since these

"cards also will be used to gain

entrance to the dorms, the security
plan was further stalled until these
_ students are photographed for IDs.
_, The Assistant Director went on
to say when the meal tickets

students’ dorm areas arrived from

Ofﬁce of Residence Life was then
forced to recontact the printer to
correct the error. i

The decision to postpone the full
implementation came about in a

Survey to Measu re

Quality of Ed ucatiorj;  ,

BY W. JACK ROIVTBERG

In a drive to improve the quality of
education at-Pitt, Assistant to the
Dean of CAS Jack Daniel is
preparing to launch an information-
gathering survey on the education-
al needs of Pitt students.

The quality of education is
declining because of a change in
the character of the student
population, according to Daniel.

Since becoming state-related,
Pitt has accepted more blacks,
women, under-privileged and ﬁrst-
generation college students, that
is, students whose parents never
went to college. Daniel says that
the faculty and administration have
not responded adequately to these
changes.

The survey will translate infor-
mation about the student body into
a usuable~form for the faculty..

“Sixty per cent of Pitt students
are ﬁrst-generation people,” Dan-
iel said. “But this statistic doesn’t
mean much to a faculty member_.”
Daniel's goal is to present the

implications of this statistic to the

faculty. - . ,

   
   

analyzing the senior surveys and
annual freshmen reports. These_

 Temporary,Apathy

The recent Pitt News survey on the issues students consider most
 reflects a nationwide trend that shows students heading
toward a renewed sense of complacency like that which was prevalent.
during the 1950s.

L tAccordingtothesurvey’sﬁndings, 36% ofstudentsoncanyuswere

suggested that the cause for such apathy lies in a reaction to the

 vehemence that prevailed on the campuses of the Sixties.

Vlﬁth thecivil rights movement in full swing, women’s liberation just
catching on, and deceptions continuing in the Vietnam War, the
college campus was another world 10 years ago, to say the least.

As a hotbed of political thought, it gave an audience to many new
and too-often “controversial” ideas. As a forum for public speakers, it

invited the world’s greatest minds to address the country’s. most.

Letter to the editor  

Boost for Union of Students

In your article, “The Faculty
Unions, Money and Power”
(September 5), you state: “it seems
the student is not of central concern
to either the University or the
Faculty in the great debate of
faculty unionization.” I draw your
attention and that of your readers
to the statement “An Open Letter
to the Pitt Student Body,” from the
Executive Committee of the
PPU/AFT published in the Pitt
News June 30.

In that statement, we noted that
the University already changed the
third .highest tuition of all
state-related universities, that this
hurt especially students from
working class and low-income
families, and that the PPU/AFT
through the AFT and AFL-ClO
“will bring -pressure to" bear on

officials, leaders of state and
lnunicipal governments, boards of
trustees and the administration
itself to....reduce or eliminate
tuition at institutions of higher
learning in the United States.”
We noted that the representative:

of organized labor on the Board of
Trustees voted against the tuition
increase here. We pointed out that
“there is simply no correlation
between high tuition levels and
unionization.” We argued that
“students and faculty have a
common interest in preserving and
improving" the quality of Pitt
education, and that we are both
threatened‘ by the budgetary
crisis.” (Salaries for most Pitt
faculty have fallen in that last two
years because of inﬂation, and they

experience and resources to help
make this. possible. Todav we
have neither student power nor

Student Leaders Call for Myslinski Resignation

(Continued from Page I)

' _-r of us are vehemently upset."

According to student in the
coalition. the soldout status of the
Notre Dame game was the key to
administration arguments that a
coupon distribution system was
necessary.

In a taped conversation. with
student leaders at the September 5
Student Affairs Council meeting
attended by Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Alfred Moye and
Chancellor Wesley Posvar. Mys-
linski said the Notre Dame game
had been sold out. sparking his
concern for an equitable ticket

__pl an .

*“So far as the South Carolina
game goes last year, we had the
space so we could and did move
students into Section 11.

“In the case of the Notre Dame
game, we do not have the space.
“We are sold out completely.”

The record early sellout of the
Notre Dame game was an
indicator. administrators said at

the meeting. that a similar
situation could be foreseen with
student attendance.

To cope with this situation. some
form of equitable ticket allocation
plan was necessary. according to
the administrators at the meeting.

"There could be violence, there
could be injury. and therefore I
cannot accept a solution that does
not stop that possibility of
violence," Posvar told the meeting.

From this meeting grew the ﬁnal
coupon distribution system as it
exists now, with students picking
up their five-color, coded booklets
and exchanging them for tickets
according to a random priority
assigned to certain colors.

According to the Student Affairs
office, which developed the plan
along with University officials. the
system is organized to give every
student with a coupon book a
significant statistical chance of
seeing at least one game this
season.

“Most students have a chance to
see one of the two popular games
(Notre Dame and Penn State) and
probably all of the rest," Moye
commented at a Senate Council

meeting last Monday.
Some students commented
throughout the week that the

system was unnecessary and

Section 11 is regularly used for

the paying public and has never
been considered a student section,
Myslinski added. His action to set
aside a number of seats in that
section for his own operational
flexibility was within the bounds of
his responsibility. Myslinski said.

“Section ll isn’t student seating

at all. Those are handled through
my office just like any other seats,
but I made special arrangements
for dates and parents, that's all."

Myslinski added that the Student

Affairs office had purchased 300
seats in Section 11 on Friday,
following the reports of opened
seating for the Notre Dame game.

Myslinski had no comment on

why tickets in sections for the Notre
Dame game were on sale Friday,
although he had requested a freeze

on sales in that area nearly two
weeks before.

Posvar had no comment on
demands for Myslinski's removal
from his post except to note that
the University reacts solely to
dialogue and not to intimidation.

Members of the student leader
coalition requested that students
register their feelings on their
seven demands with the Chancel-
lor's office today.

member said.

altered to suit the needs of the

students.

“In any class you have students
of all different learning styles,
habits and abilities. Walking in and
lecturing is not always the most
effective wa_v of reaching stu-
dents." Daniel said.

A second motive of Daniel’s work
is to restore students’ confidence in
the value of a liberal arts degree.

“Because of the job market,"
Daniel said, “students are aware of
what engineering and business
degrees can get but not of what can
be done with a liberal arts degree.”

Daniel asserted that this confu-
sion is another deﬁciency at Pitt.
After learning what the needs of
the students are, Daniel suggested
they also should be taught how a
liberal arts degree is relevant to
their needs.

ATHLETES ROW

BY STEVE FINE

Athlete’s Row? Varsity Walk?
This obscure Pitt landmark is of no
concern to most students, preoc-
cupied with their own survival in
the academic whirlpool.

There is’ a distinct possibility,
though, that once the bad weather
arrives and students begin walk-
ing with their heads bowed (a Pitt
tradition in itself), they will notice
inscriptions on the walkway be-
tween the Cathedral and Bellefield
Avenue--names and dates, headed
by the inscription, “Dedicated To
Students Who Are Promoting The‘
University Of Pittsburgh Through
Varsity Athletics.”

No, they are not graves. George
Radosevich, honored in 1951, is
remembered by many Peabody
High School alumni as being very
much alive. He was the possessor
of a deadly forehand exhibited
frequently during swim class,
which was taken in the nude.

Assistant,Athletic Director Steve
Petro, a veteran of Pitt’s glory days
of football and a member of the
1937 Rose Bowl champions, ex-

- plained the awards as an attempt to

establish a tradition on campus.
Two awards were given at the close
of the 1950 season. The Charles C.
“Doc” Hartwig Award, named for
the former Pitt All-American guard
and coach, was awarded to the
outstanding varsitv athlete of the
year. This usually meant a football
player. The Athletic Committee
Award was given to the outstand-
ing student athlete, enabling
members of other teams to gain
recognition. 

“We have had over 80 All-Am-
ericans in football, as well as men
like Pop Warner and Jock
Sutherland associated with the
University,” Petro explained.
“Varsity Walk was instituted to
instill a sense of pride in the
athletic tradition here.’ ’

The late sixties witness a shift in
the interests of students, as well as
some amazingly poor football
teams. Politics and drugs left no
room for competition from the
athletic department. Awareness
was accompanied by apathy.
Nobody cared to notice the hapless

Pitt teams, mired in mediocrity.
The awards were discontinued in
1969, as Casimir Myslinski put it,
“because they were no longer in
the best interests of the University
body.”

The award will go to the
outstanding student-athlete.

Possibly, this award will signal

the beginning once again of ai

visible athlete tradition at Pitt.
Instead of the constant complaints

/

 

Now that the Majors era is upon
us, though,
regained its respectability, the
interest of the student body is
ballooning. Turnaway crowds are
expected this year if the tickets are
ever distributed. The Golden
Panthers, a booster club founded
three years ago, has swelled from
300 members to over 2,000, with
chapters planned throughout the
state.

In addition to pre-game lunches

‘and fund-raising activities, the

Golden Panthers are initiating a
Golden Panther Award to be given
at th_e All-Sports Banquet in April.

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

John Eibl, a sophomore in
engineering, trudges into Bene-
dum Hall between eight and nine
every morning after ﬁghting the

I traffic from his home in Baldwin

Borough and beating some other
commuter out of a parking space.
He walks into class, deposits his
homework on the instructor’s table
and takes a seat. He spreads his
600-page, hardback textbook, a
notebook and a pencil out on the
desk, removes his calculator from
its case, and prepares for another
day in the School of Engineering.
As in most of Eibl’s classes, the
professor goes over the problems
that had been assigned for the
previous ‘ night. He sketches dia-
grams on the board, explains how
the problems should be worked out
and answers an occasional question
from one of the 40 faces watching
him. After 50 minutes have passed
and another set of problems has
been assigned, class ends.
“Attendance isn’t mandatory in
most classes, but a lot of the profs
give unannounced quizzes that
can’t be made up,” Eibl says.
“Also, we have problems to do
practically every night. That’s the
bad thing about engineering--you

;__  know you have to turn something in

“av;

every class and can’t put it off.”

Eibl says he spends about 20
hours per week in class and three
or four doing domework every
night. Like many other engineers,
he "spends most of his day in
Benedum.

“Everyone stays in their own
little circle--close to where they
have classes. That’s the bad thing
about commuting--you can’t get
involved. I stop in the Union every
now and then to see if anything is
going on, but everybody I know is
up here," Eibl complains.

Each division within the School

of Engineering has its own lounge,
intramural teams and activiaties.
Eibl says now that he’s chosen
his area--mechanical engineering--
he wants to start participating in
his group’s functions.

But for now, he and his friends
spend their free time sitting around
Benedum’s first-floor lounge with
their feet on the tables--talking,
eating Saran-Wrapped sandwiches
or, sometimes, getting a little work
out of the way.

“When I was a freshman, all my
friends had the same courses so
we'd plow through the problems
together between classes. That
made it a lot easier, but we can’t do
that now.”

Some instructors encourage stu-
dents to work together on
assignments for a couple -of
reasons, according to Eibl. “Alfew
suggest it because it just makes
more sense to have everyone
understand all the work instead of
spending a whole evening on one
part of it.

“But with others--you get good.

profs, but there are some pretty
terrible ones, too--they want you to
figure it out any way you can. Just
so you don’t bother them in their
offices.”

Freshman year in engineering
can be a frustrating one, Eibl says.

“When you’re a freshman you
get a block schedule. Everyone
takes the same classes and has the
same advisor--one advisor‘ for 400
kids.

‘‘It’s like you’re just dropped in a
stream and you get dragged along
with it. You don’t have time to look
around and see if this is what you
want,” Eibl explains. “Around the
end of your first year, you have to
grab for a pole along the way--a
department you hope you’ll be
happy in.” Eibl says “Mechani-
cal” is his pole because it’s the

broadest division within the School. '

7- 9-  Selptemlber .15 , ll 

Engineers—Different Classes, Same People

In addition to his engineering
and math courses, Eibl is taking an
anthropology course this term to
fulﬁll the distribution-of-studies
requirement.

“I wish I could just spend one
whole term in CAS and take
courses I feel like taking. Just to
see what it’s like."

When one of his friends suggests
it would make an easy term, Eibl
disagrees. ‘‘I’m sure it’s probably
just as _much work, but the pressure
is different. You’re pressured
around exam time and when You
have to get papers done. But it’s_
pretty easy to let things slide for a
week or two.

“CAS classes are a nice break

after all the engineering and math.
I get a certain amount of
satisfaction or sense of accom-
plishment in working out the
problems, but it’s nice to go to a
lecture, hear somebody talking,
and know you ‘won’t have a load of
problems to work out when you get
home."

Engineers spend a lot of time
working out problems. They also
spend a lot of money on books. Eibl
says his books usually cost about
$80 per term. One course this year
will run close to $50 for books and
lab instruments.

And it’s difficult to find used
engineering books. Most students
save them for when they’re

working, to be used for reference.‘

Another expense most engineers
incur is the price of an electronic
calculator. Eibl claims that, even
though he couldn’t really afford the
transistorized mathematician when
he bought it, it is just one of those
things he needs to get by. He says
he could work out most of the
computations without the machine,
but it would take so long he
probably would never complete an
exam.

Anticipation...hushed excite-
ment...last-minute crowd pouring
.in..’.everyone’s settled...the lights
dim.‘
f Then the maestro makes his way
fto the platform. The orchestra is
standing now as the ovation from
3 the audience continues. Suddenly
the opening bars of the “Star
Spangled Banner” fill the air and
the 1975 season of the Pittsburgh
-. Symphony is underway.

William Steinberg opened his
last season as music director on
_ Friday night with works by Richard
; Strauss before intermission and

I ’ Richard Wagner after.

 'The 76-year-old Steinberg was
‘ i not in the best of health and sat on
K a high stool for most of the concert.
He did, however, “rise to the
occasion” several times when the
intensity of the music seemed to
sweep him off his feet.

‘The orchestra appeared over-
eager in its desire to perform well
for its conductor. Aided by the
addition of five new, young
players, it succeeded in a splendid
» display of musical talent.

Don Juan, Opus 20 was the ﬁrst
work on the program. It was
inspired by an 1844 poem by
Nikolaus Lenau, who psychoanal-
zyed the legend of Don Juan,
 ~. ladykiller. What emerges is not the
 -selfish seducer but a man
" ;< conquered by his own anxieties,
.._.j fears and insecurities. This is just

, ' what Strauss portrays in his
' , musical portrait.

In the opening of the piece, Don
Juan appears in all his splendor,
hailed by one and all through a
sparking score set off by flamboy-
ant violin melodies.

Some later themes display the
_ ‘tender moments of romance as the
5 various rendezvous occur. These
.‘ moments are captured in the solos
. .of,__ an oboe, the ﬂutes, the horns
and the cellos, as the melodies leap
and dance from one section to
— another.

   
  
  
  
 
   
   
 

 announce echoes of past courtships

of the ﬁrst theme, the second
theme, that of Till the rogue, is
established.

In and out of these various
themes are intertwined little
motives from the first theme. ‘
Some are bright and mischievous;
others represent Till’s emotions
and are more solemn.

Till’s death is represented in two
notes only. And his past pranks are
recaptured and gloriﬁed in a
section that returns to the charm of
the ﬁrst folklore theme. In the end
Till is saluted as a true hero.

In the Prelude to Lohengrin, Act
I Wagner presents a picture ofthe
heavens unfolding as an angel
offers a view of the sacred Grail to
the hero Lohengrin.

The lush two-part violin section
sings out, the woodwinds enter and
the Wagnerian leifmotives appear
throughout. Heavy , chords are
heard‘ from the brass and the
percussion resounds within the
hall. The fury lasts temporarily
and "serenity reigns in the final
strains.

Wagner's opera ‘Siegfried con-
tains more idyllic scenes than
anywhere else in the entire ring
cycle. The “Forest Murmurs”
from Siegfried is very poetic, as the
orchestra hints at the whispers of
the trees in the string section and
the songs of the birds in the
woodwinds.

The final work of the night‘ was
the . Kaisermarch. intended by
Wagner as an anthem-type com-
position. Triumphant, jubilant,
and patriotic are the only terms to
describe this vivid music.

the woodwinds, strings later join
in, and the strength of the piece is
in the brass section.

tell jokes.”

Is this man blowing his own
horn? Judge for yourself, he’s a
flutist. _

A common preconception that
goes with the world of professional
musicians is the presence of
‘hotheads’ and ‘grouches.’

“No, there aren’t any hotheads
here,” stated one long-time mem-
ber. “We are a family orchestra,
really close-knit.”

The same member of the
orchestra discussed the subjects
musicians talk about during the
concert intermissions. .

“Sports. lt’s not music we talk
about. We even have our _own
baseball team. On tours we play
other orchestras’ teams. Like
Philly. They have a good team,
even if the orchestra is cliquish.”

This is not to say the musicians
don’t consider their music impor-
tant, they do. Most members of
the orchestra never kid each other
about theirplaying; music is all
very serious to_ them.

There appears a correlation
between the personalities of
players and their instruments.
“The second violas are much
mellower people, as opposed to
others, who are intense,” says a
younger member of the orchestra.

“For instance, the ﬁrst ﬁddles
are very emotional.” -

One thing in common «with all the
musicians in the orchestra, is their
great admiration and respect for
Steinberg. Most of the members
seem to be in awe of him, although
he isn’t a slavedriver with a
bullwhipin one hand'and a baton

in the other. -
In the event that you can ever

drag yourself away from TV long
enough to go down to Heinz Hall
and see the orchestra, you may rest
assured that while none of the
performers are suddenly going to
stand up, waver and collapse under
the strain, the music will be firmly
conducted by Steinberg in the
tradition of the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony Orchestra.

‘Ridin' High’
On New LP

BY DOUG GEBHARD

“Ridin’ High,” Jerry Jeff Walker,

“Yeah, lguess it's better to be
known by your name instead of by a
song you wrote..." Jerry Jeff

Walker in The Improbable Rise of
Red-Neck Rock.

. 3 1;;

  

It is hard to describe to you
where Jerry‘ Jeff comes from
because like he said, he comes
from everywhere. He’s been living
in cities and bars and bus stations
and big homes all his life just
singing and playing...and getting
thrown in the can. i ‘

His music is country. It is also
rock-oriented with bluegrass roots.
It is also, from personal testimony
and that of other observers, drunk
music. When he does an album, it
is done loosely and one can ﬁnd in
the recording a certain air of
rowdiness. Many times harmonies
will not be in key’ and playing won't
be up to par but the feel will be

there with-his incredible lyrical

sense.

Ridin’ High is inthe tradition of
loose albums but departs with it in
production. In past efforts he has
incorporated a live performance or
it has been a live performance
(Viva Terlingua) with production
coming off as such...live. as
opposed to studio. This

An admirable medley followed
about the drag of living on the road
with‘David Bromberg's “New Lee
Highway Blues," on which the

‘bass speeded up as the guitar

slipped into the tension-desperate
high chords of “Coaltown Red," an
Irish folk tune.

The band played well together,
but lacked magic to bring the crowd
together. This was also true of the
second act, Grinderswitch, and the
hour it took to set up because of a
late arrival didn’t help to warm up
the crowd. ,

Stew. In the lengthy improvisa-
tions, it shifted from delicate
melodies to ear-battering electric
blues, often drowning out the
vocals. Steve Miller on organ
handled complimentary playing
well, at times using call-and-res-
ponse with other members instead
of picking up the usual solo.

The final number, Elmore
James’ “Pickin the Blues,” got
some people on their feet, daring
the ass-chilled crowd in song, “You
think you can’t take a chance.”

Late in the afternoon, the Earl
Scruggs Revue appeared to warm
applause. The crowd had thinned

Earlorganized the Revue about ‘

Released," “Swimmin’Song," and
Billy Joel's “Traveling Prayer,”
among many others. The sound
was very good over-all without a
lick getting lost in a muddle of
sound.

Musical versatility was demon-

p strated when Steve Scruggs left the

piano to pick the instrumental
_ “Earl’s Breakdown,” written after
the birth of son Randy. The Revue
switched easily from bluegrass to
blues to honky-tonk to a gospel
tune honed sharp by bluegrass and
powered by hard electric bass.

The effect was that of a single
mind controlling the band’s move-
ments as it played complimentary
of one another, passing the melody
from member to member, a few
bars at a time, without missing a
beat. This focus on a single
melodic effect, instead of the
combination of many ideas, forged
a power to bring the crowd to its
feet at last, bathing in Scruggs
sunshine.

Following two encore numbers,
the Revue prepared to head for
Bloomsburg, Pa. Buzzing from
wine and good time, the crowd
disappeared within ﬁve minutes.

  Booters Survive Difficult W

BY JIM LEWIS

A You remember the Pitt Soccer
Team of three weeks ago--un-

’ tested, inexperienced, uncertain--

with nothing but a big question
mark ﬁlling its crystal ball of the
future.

‘You also remember the Akron
and Bucknell soccer teams--exper-
ienced, tested--with a list of
championships and other credits
longer than a roll of Scott toilet
tissue.

Even Pitt Coach Leo Bemis was
uncertain about Pitt’s chances in
the two games--giving nothing but
praise to Akron and Bucknell while
being quite unsure about the
"quality of his own team. .

But after all that, guess
what--Pitt answered all questions
about the quality of the team,
losing only 1-0 to Bucknell after
T_YING- Akron 0-0, accomplish-

if " . ments that start a team thinking of
 ' . much better things than a 4-6-2
1 record of a year ago.

Like an
undefeated season the rest of the
way. Or maybe even a soccer
dynasty that could last a couple
decades.

I '1*9'7'5 ‘

(among such notables were the
John Curley Fan Club, the Andy
Behrend Fan Club, the John
Morahan Fan Club, and a lady who
kep yelling “C’mon Pittl”) braved
the cold and threatening skies to
witness one of the best opening
game efforts by a Pitt soccer team
in a long time. When the game was
over, however, the crowd's favor-
itism had to sway towards Pitt
goalie Frank Bucci. who, with the
help ofa solid defense, shut out the
speedy Akron offense.

The first half of the game was
exciting, with both teams racing up
and down the ﬁeld and both
offenses getting good chances to
score. As a matter of fact, Akron
almost did score, hitting the
crossbar on what appeared to be a
sure scoring opportunity. -

In the second half, the Akron
offense kept the same kind of
pressure on the Pitt net, seemingly
playing most of the second half
around the Panthers’ crease.

But, as throughout the whole
game, the Pitt defensethwarted all
Akron opportunities to a point
where you had the feeling the
Akron bench wanted to run out
onto the field and throw the ball

into the net (the Pitt defense
probably would have stopped that.
too).
10-minute overtime periods--a 0-0
tie.

On Saturday, Pitt was matched
up against Bucknell, a team Coach
Leo Bemis described as . “well
coached, in top shape, and tested."

However, all the coaches, shapes
and tests in the world couldn’t help
the Bucknell offense put the ball in
the net in the first half. Every
opportunity was stopped by the Pitt
defense.

Meanwhile, the Pitt offense, a
very questionable part of the team
this year, showed ' signs of
perfection here and there, but
always seemed to pass the ball
away to the opposition when it got
deep into Bucknell territory.
Basically, it was Bucknell in the
first half, just as Akron’s offense
seemed to take the upper hand in
the second half of its game.

Finally, midway through the
second half, Bucknell’s offense
broke through Pitt’s ' defense.
Sophomore sensation Scott Stras-
burg caught up with a pass in Pitt’s
end zone near the net, and before
anyone realized what had hap-

The final result--after two"

pened, he shot a bullet into the far
corner of the goal past fallen goalie
Frank Bucci.

That was all the scoring in the
game.

Despite the 1-0 loss to Bucknell,
Coach Bemis and the team have to
be proud of the outcome of the Pitt

eekend

Soccer Classic. They have proven
they can play with the big soccer
powers and can stir up a little
commotion around the soccer world
this year. They’ve answered any
questions about the quality of their
team.

They are no longer a “mystery
team.”

With Total Devotion

BY TOM HALL

“Instead of ‘Pride of the Lion,
we might rename it ‘Pride of the
Panther,‘ . ’_’, said Ernie Gross,
co-captain of the 1975 Pitt soccer
team. “Pride of the Lion refers to a
unity, a devotion. That’s what our
team has, a devotion to each other
and to the sport of soccer."

Ernie Gross, a product of
Ringgold High in Monongahela, is

—one of four senior members of the‘
 Pitt squad. It has been only in the

past two years, however, that he
has made a name for himself.
“Ernie never lacks on hustle,

never," said Head Coach Leo
Bemis. “He's always in the thick
of thinks. His career in soccer

began a bit late in his life, during
hisjunior year in high school. “It's
too bad Ernie doesn't have a better
ball control game then he does,"
Bemis said. “He really loves the
sport, and his technique has really
come around since he ﬁrst came to
Pitt."

Gross would be the first to agree
with his coach. “I’ve only been

playing soccer for six years, since I
g, was about 16. You can't really dc
that with any sport. You've got to

start young.” ‘

1 His physical attributes adapted
well to soccer. He has good speed,
a sturdy frame, and above all, a
mental attitude that seems to be
spreading like the plague on this
year’s team. .

“We really have to go out and
play as a team. ’ Unity is what
makes a good soccer team, real
devotion to the game and to your

' teammates. This has got to be the

most enthusiastic team we've ever
had here."

Another indication of the prom-
ise, of this year’s booters can be
noticed in their outstanding physi-
cal conditioning. “This team is at
its physical peak right now,” Gross
said. “If we can stay this way for
the rest of the season, we can have
a great year.”

Gross started his conditioning
program early - in the summer,
when he could rise in the wee hours
and run a daily two-mile course. “I

did a lot of extra work this summer
and I think it’s really paying off for
me now. Our practice sessions are

basically exercises, just keeping in .

shape, and they’re a lot easier for

me now than they have been in past

seasons.”

His favorite exercise? “I love to
do what they call six-inchers (lying
flat on your back and holding your
legs six inches in the air). The guys
really used to hate me for them.
But now they’re glad they’re in the
shape they’re in, because soccer is
really a rougher sport than most
people think."

And for a show of team unity?
“Can you dig this,.the coach even
does six-inchers with the team. We
are a really tight group. We eat
together, practice together, and
when we're just standing around,
we even stand around together."
Then that word comes up again.
Devotion. “It really makes the
team what it is, the devotion we
have toward each other.”

“You have to have that unity to
play as a team, and in soccer, you
have to play the whole game.
There is no offense and defense.
Everyone’ has to play the entire
game.”

He has

some interesting

thoughts on soccer at Pitt. “I think '

the game is really starting to catch
on, not only here, but all over the
country, It was a fantastic feeling
to go into last weekend's matches
and play before the biggest crowd
I've ever seen at a Pitt game.

“I think the game is spreading in
this country,” Gross said. “There
are soccer leagues, junior soccer
leagues _and midget soccer leagues.
The kids are starting to play this
game, and that has to improve the
quality of the sport in this country.

“When I went to my first
professional soccer match, I ab-
solutely fell for the game then and
there. If more people would come
out to see it, I know they’d like it
too. ‘

Perhaps the senior co-captain,
who plays the wing-fullback posi-
tion. has a thought. Pitt's next
soccer match is scheduled against
Point Park at Pitt Stadium on
Saturday.

Road Racing Program
  Returns to University

After a year's absence, road

racing has returned to Pitt. Three‘

weeks ago at Nelson’s Ridges
Raceway in Warren, Ohio, the
University’s Javelin (which pre-

‘ viously was owned by the late Mark

Donahue) rolled onto the track
following 12 months of ﬁnancial
difﬁculties for the team.

Although the car started in-

midfield of the 25-car race, the
experienced Pitt driver Bob Fryer
managed to grab second place. A
run for the number-one position
was about to be tried when the
throttle linkage began to stick.

“Trying to ride the brakes and
slow the car‘ down on turns at 130
miles-per-hour just didn't work for
long,” Fryer said. “Finally I
decided it wasn’t worth the risk and
shut it down.’_" ,

“Over-all I’m pleased with the

performance of the car.__, Despite
the fact it was grounded for a year,

it responded marvelousiy and ran
really well,” Fryer continued.

Many students are unaware
there is a Pitt Road Racing Team.
In fact, it is the ﬁrst college racing
team in America and the student
body should encourage it with more
attendance at events.

The team is associated with the
Sports Car Club of America- (SCCA)
and the International Motor Sports
Association (IMSA). Therefore,
the club can compete in world
racing events and all sanctioned
SCCA races. All it needed was a
ﬁnancial backer.

“We were actually contacted by
a major corporation to run in
Warren,” Fryer explained. “We
really think we have found a solid
ﬁnancial base to work from. All we
need is the students’ support.”

Pitt students interested in Pitt
roadracing, rallies and motor-
crosses are invited to attend a
general meeting tonight at 8 pm.

BY JlM.SPANOS

Editor’s Note: The following is
the opinion of one Pitt News Sports
writer and does not reflect the
over-all opinion of the paper.

For quite a,few years, Eastern
football, like a bad cold, had been
something you had to put up with
but really didn’t want to talk about.
Pitt floundered to three consecutive
1-9 seasons in the late sixties, and
West Virginia produced some
decent won-lost records in the late
sixties and early 1970s, though
normally against a bunch of
non-formidable opponents. Boston
College has produced some teams
that would ﬁt into the fair-to-
mediocre range, but generally
wasn’t taken very seriously.

Penn State has occupied a very
eccentric position in the scheme of
things. Though appearing in major
bowl games in seven of the last‘
eight’ years, and winning five of
those, it was normally talked about
scornfully. Critics of Head Coach
Joe Paterno said, rather foolishly,
that because the Lions played such
an easy schedule, they weren’t that
good. It’s just that they could get
psyched up for one or two big
games each year and win.

This year, however, _Eastern
football is ﬁnally gaining some
recognition, and several teams are
in on the bonanza. In one poll after
another, the East has been well
represented. Penn State, as usual,
is normally ranked seventh or
eighth, Pitt gets eighteenth, and
Boston College has been listed as
number 20 by at least one major

‘sports magazine.

This week will determine
whether in fact all the excitement is
well-founded. Tonight, Boston
College hosts Notre Dame. On
Saturday, Pitt travels to Oklahoma
(enough said already), Penn State
visits Ohio State, and West
Virginia goes to the University of
California.

The Notre Dame-Boston college
contest could be very interesting.
BC finished 8-3 last year, and
quarterback Mike Kruczek, who
completed 68.9% of his passes, is
back once again. .

Notre Dame comes off a 10-2

.M0ndﬂYl.Se_ptetnbér 1f5{.’i9§75;.riiE riTT ,NEWs§;Eageiii»P 

I Grosscombines Hustle     East Faces Tough week   

season and an Orange Bowl win
against Alabama, but a new coach
(Dan Devine) and a new s-ystem
may cause some problems. The
Irish lack an experienced quarter-
back. H

Beating Notre Dame could set
the stage for ‘a winning season, a
bowl game and some outstanding
recruits next year. It’s a very
important game for a team still
struggling to grab some of the
spotlight. ,

In much the same way, the Penn
State affair is equally important. A
win against Ohio State would [at
least for a year] silence the
skeptics. I’ve been told that
Paterno has turned just a bit
meaner this year, because he
surely doesn’t want to'come back
from Ohio State looking like some
sort of fool. Whether you like to
admit it or not, Penn State has been
as good as anybody in the country
during the past eight years.

Ohio State is the home’ team, and
surely will be favored by the
oddsmakers. The Buckeyes are led
by quarterback Cornelius Greene,
fullback Pete Johnson and tailback
Archie Griffin, the winner of last
year's Heisman trophy.

Just how good Ohio State is has
not yet been determined. It
defeated, but did not crush,
Michigan State, 21-0. Penn State is
better than Michigan State, how-
ever, and the game will come down
to a battle between the Ohio State
backﬁeld and the Penn State
defense. In recent years, Ohio
States’ schedule has been every bit
as easy as the Lions’, largely
because the Buckeyes are in _the
Big Ten Conference, which might
also have been named the Big Two
and Little Eight.

Penn State has a remarkable way

of getting ready for the really big .
games. lt’s early in the season, but

State was very impressive against
Stanford in its home opener, and it
played without sophomore sensa-
tion Jimmy Ceffalo.

Penn State will win, something
like 22-19, and Eastern football

once again will be taken seriously.

Pitt’s predicament is a cumber-

some one. Oklahoma is so superior
to anybody else in the country that ‘

The baseball team will hold a
meeting on Wednesday, Septem-
ber 17, at 4 pm in Trees Hall.
Anyone interested is invited to
attend.
