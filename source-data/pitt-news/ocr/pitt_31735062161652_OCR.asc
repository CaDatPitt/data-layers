 sections.

One of these contrasts shows
that the two cities '\v:?th. the high-—
est rateof growth today are Do-
troit and Los Angeles and that the
cities with the weakest rate of
growth are Boston and.Pittsb.urgh.

No New Industries

Reasons for Pittsburgh’s pres-
ent-day position are: (1) the city
is mature, having had its greatest.
spurt before the turn of the cen-
tury and (2) that the city i.s high-
ly specialized and has failed to
attract new industries.

ar from being a discouraging,
survey, the book does not claim}
the end of the city’s prosperity or
preeminence in certain industrial
ﬁelds. The author pointed out in
an interview that there is a differ-
-ence between growth and pros-
perity.

Substantiating this point, he
showed that areas are benefited by
a gradual growth; these beneﬁts
being, in part, the lack of “boom-
town evils” and a more ﬁrm com-
mercial and ﬁnancial foundation.

Post- War Changes

Post-war changes in the indus-
trial‘ structure" have been a de-
crease in “coaland ‘coke produc-
tion, slowing down of the expan-
sion of manufacturing output; con-
tinued shift of manufacturing op-

erations from nucleus city to
smaller industrial cities along
rivers . . and decreasing relative

importance of the iron and steel
industry within manufacturing in-
dustries.”g V

Giving an example of how these
factors slowed down Pittsburgh
expansion, Mr. McLaughlin, in his
talk, cited the coke problem. Coke
production, he said, dropped off
because of the innovation of the
by-product method which obviated
the use of the bee.-hive process.
Pittsburgh and environs were the
center of bee-hive coking opera-
tions.

Gaye, played by John Weisbrod,
 Linda, a.s secretary to Steph-
en, has loveﬁd him silently for
years, but he 'is too egocentric to
notice her. So, when handsome
Dickey,  McAdams, C38; ar-
rives, Linda after much persuasion
marries him.

Famous in. “Accent on Youth”
since it took Broadway and Holly-
wood by storm in 1934 are the
scenes in which Dickey is coach-
ed by Stephen Gaye on‘ the art of
making love; and the one in which
Stephen uses Linda’s avowal of
love as the basis of a new play.
He makes Linda repeat the_li‘ne's
while he writes them.  

Carl Cass is directing “Accent
on Youth,” as the’ last‘ show :he
will do for the. University dra-
matic group which he -has led for
eight years. Mr. Cass plans to
leave at the end of the semester
for a position at the University of
Wisconsin,‘ where he will work on
his doctorate degree.

In his years at the University»,
Mr. Cass. has coached, over 250
Players in dramatic shows. In ad-
dition, probably that: many more
have worked on the other staffs.
in‘ connection with the produc-
tions. v

Completing the cast of “Accent
on Youth” are Laura Jean Smith,
C40; Sylvia Shapiro, C38; Bob
King, C38; Oscar G-oodstein, C38;

‘Richard Klemer, C405; and Gilbert

Mellin, C40. The set for the pro-
duction was made by James Lind-
say, local stage designer. Helen
Akerman, C38, and Thelma Nath-
an, C40, are assisting in the pro-
duction. - -

Last in a series of ﬁve vocation-

and economic standing probably
will not be affected by the level-1
ing off of rapid growth, Mr. 1VIc- I
Laughlin believes that growth
could be restarted if new indus-
tries could be settled in this dis-
trict. '

Fails To Attract

However, in the past 3 years,
the city has failed to attract three
of the present day industrial giant
industries. He showed that the
city “slipped up” on the radio in-
dustry, which began here, and on
the airplane and automobile in-
dustries. ‘

Today the signiﬁcant contribu-
tions to industrial growth in this
section are the expansion of elec-
trical apparatus and aluminum in-
dustries. ' .

Work on the book started in
1930. Mr. McLaughlin, who joined
the University in 1929, and the
staff of the Bureau are working on
another book, “Whither Pitts-
burgh?” This book will be a com-
prehensive study of Pittsburgh
alone. It will take up all lines of
industrial, commercial, and ﬁnan-
cial activity.

The course, usually called
“Safety «First Methods,” is of-'
fered by the department of chem-
istry. Forty students have regis-

“The Pirates of Penzance” was

ﬁrst produced in 1879 in New
~ Yo;k, because the authors had be-
come incensed over the theft of
royalties of their previous shows
by American" producers. It was
immediately hailed by the Amer-
ican public of the English operetta
writers. Since then it has be-
come a prominent part of the rep-
ertoire of the D’Oyly Carte com-
pany, original prcducers of the
operettas.
SATIRIZES LOYALTY

A satire, “The Pirates of Pen-
zance” dealslwith young Fred-
erick, who had been apprenticed to
a group of kindly orphan pirates,
who never bother other orphans,

lice and the ope1‘etta “pokes fun at

Graduates
Pay Tribute

To Trustee

Review Carries

Story By Former
Pitt News Editor

The Alumni Review, ofﬁcial
publication of the General Alum-
ni Association, pays tribute to Dr.
George Hubbard Clapp, president
of the University’s Board of Trus-
tees, in the April issue which ap-
peared this Week.

Dr. Clapp has been a member
of the Board of Trustees since
1902, and president of the govern-
ing body since 1907.

DISTRICT‘ LEADER

Besides his University activi-
ties. Dr. Clapp has served for
many years as a civic, social, pa-
t:r;otic, and cultural leader in the
Pittsburgh district. As a pioneer
in the aluminum industry he ha.s
been president of the Pittsburgh

esting Laborato:y and treasurer,
secretar, and vice-president of
the Alumninum Company of
America.

The Review says in its tribute:
“The Alumni Review salutes Dr.
George Hubbard Clapp, Ph. B.,
1877; Sc. D. 1915; a leader in
Pittsburgh business and inclus-
try; a distinguished citizen of
WGSLQTH Pennsylvania; a patron
of science, art, and learning; a
beloved friend of the University
of Pittsburgh.”

The Review’s article is illus-
trated with the portrait, a water
color of Dr. Clapp which Was
painted by Madame Elizabeth
Shoumatofl’. The picture will soon
be hung in the Cathedral.

By LEONARD LEVISON
Sports Editor.

Passing for converastion
during the past few days was
the following:

Big leaguer —- Jerome Her-
man Dean, who has a right arm
that is considered to be rather
an affluent instrument, spent the
past few days on the campus, or
what is generally conceded to be a
campus extension, the Hotel
Schenley, while his newly-acquir-
ed teammates stopped in town to
see wh at the
Pirates had in
the way of a
baseball t -e a m
this year.

He was ob-
served by sev-
eral of the local
student b o d y,
not on Fog-
arty’s knoll in
the lot across
the tracks, but
in one of the
cries, Tito’s
Oakland beer-
Club Casino. by name. All he had
to say was that he would appear
at the Style Show, which he
didn't, and that the Pirates didn’t
have a chance for the pennant,
which they do (it is suspected).

It really doesn’t matter that his
mental processes are not too
sharp, anyway. He never receiv-
ed a diploma, but he is reportedly
enjoying life.

Levison

Baseba.ller—Jimmy Hagan tried
and tried the other afternoon, but
he couldn’t lift the baseball into
the left ﬁeld stands of the Stadium
diamond. Which either proves that
the fence is a long way away from
home plate or that brother Ha-
gan’s batting eye still needs a lit-
tle conditioning.

Long legs—-Just how Jim Her-
bert really can stack up against
Johnny Wodruff may be given an-
other answer in Philadelphia this
’week—end. The two long-striding
middle distancers will probably
meet in the last leg of the mile
relay when Pitt runs against NYU
or OSU, unless the advance info is
askew.

During the indoor season Jim
lost a number of yards to John-
ny in the ﬁnals of the same event
in the IC4A, but it was claimed at
the time that Herbert was in very
poor shape. This seems to be chief
trouble with the NYU long-legg-er.
He is too inconsistent. In a dual
meet with Temple a few weeks ago
he was beaten by a Violet team-
mate, Ed Stripling.

spite his record smearing Alcoma

her 3 position on the Pitt team

Panthers Seek Team

Titles In Penn Relays

By BILL MAZEFSKY
All sorts of national and world track records will probably

be sheared today and tomorrow

at Franklin Field in Philadel-

phia during the annual Penn Relays, and the crack troop of
Panther tracksters will be up in the front trenches when the
standards start slipping. The collection of star cindermen that
has convened in Quakertown for this two day track carnival,

which is always one of the fea-¢
tures of the outdoor track season,
will turn on enough pressure to
blow some of the current records
into history. '
The Panther contingent will be
concerned, primarily, with three
relays, the mile relay, freshman
and Va rs ity,
and the med-
ley relay. The
highlight of
the meet will
be the Class A
mile relay run,
and the win-
ner will have
a strangle hold
on the nation-
al champion-
ship title. — For
the ﬁrst time
Pitt has been
invited to com-

INDOOR RECORD

Their undefeated indoor record

McKee, Ferrara, and Woodruif to
The teams from
Ohio State and NYU’ will offer
the Panthers the stiffest competi-
tion. The Pitt team has already
beaten both in indoor competition.
A victory for the State. or.Violet
team, however, will not nearly
fall into the upset category; each
of these two teams has trotted
around the outdoor mile course in
faster tempo than the Panthers.

The Panther medley team last
year ran off with the Penn Relay
title and set a new world record.
This year the medley team has
been strengthened by the addition
of Frank Ohl and Al McKee with
Dick Mason and Johnny Woodruif
holdovers. Mason and Ohl will
do the 220, McKee will run the
440, and Johnny Woodruff will
again anchor at his specialty,
the 880.

FROSH QUARTETT

A quartet of freshmen will have
the job of retaining another
championship won last year. Last
spring the first year quartet, of
which Ohl, McKee and Farrara
were three-fourths, won the mile
relay in record time. The new
combination of Del Anderson, Bob
Graf. Larry Tregonning, and Al
Boulanger will have the job of
defense.

In the individual events, Cap-
tain Mason will compete in the
special invitational 100. The top-
ﬂight dash men in collegiate circle
will sprint for the title of the 1938
speed king. Indoor performances

links, according to co-golf strate- lpoint to Columbia’s Bob Johnson

gist Hagan.

the century title.

Someone, prob-
ably Johnson, may be pushed to
a new record here.

Pete Bennett in the high jump
and Johnny Bazyk in the shot put
will round out the Panther com-
petition. If Frank Ohl can find
time between his relay duties, he
may take a couple of cracks at the
broad jump activities.

Team Plays 1

Dukes Today

With two victories already
tucked away, Pitt’s net team faces 
its greatest test of the season when 
the Panthers lock racquets with

the powerful Duquesne squad on
the Stadium courts this afternoon.

Both teams have been opposed
by comparatively weak outﬁts in
their matches so far and have won
without extending themselves.
The Dukes stopped West Virginia
8-1, while Pitt overcame Bethany
9-0, and Allegheny 8-1.

The Panthers have swept all
their doubles matches, their only
loss coming when Topper of Alle-
gheny downed Ray Light, 6-1, 6-2.

Interest this afternoon will cen- !
ter around the No. 1 and No. 2‘
contest. McColligan of Duquesne
will oppose Head Panther Ralph
Bald, and Pitt’s Joe Kristufek will
try to put them past Lackner of,
the Dukes. Bald has done a ﬁne '
job in replacing the graduateql
Bobby Madden, but Kristafek
has pressed him continually for
the No. 1 spot.

Hartman will hold down the
third spot in the Panther line-up
and his Duquesne rival will be
Mazer. McKenna, Pitt, opposes
Mazer in the fourth match.

Though Pasqualachio and Kram i
are deﬁnitely the other Duke
starters, Pitt has four aspirants
for the ﬁfth and sixth notches in?
Light, Mogan, Weiss, and Lewis.

last outing for this year at Laurel
Ridge, this week-end.

Instead of the ‘winter sports of
the’ V previous outings which in-
cluded ice-skating and skiing,
summer ones will be substituted if 
the warm weather continues. Ten-

planned. -

The “De-ion” principle is one which breaks arcs into
segments by passing them through a series of grids.
It has completely revolutionized the construction of
such arc-carrying devices as lightning" arresters,
circuit breakers, motor starters, and safety switches.

The “De—ion” principle was discovered and put into
practice by Dr. Joseph Slepian of the Westinghouse
Research Laboratories. A

The “Spencer Disc” is a type of thermostat which
acts on the bi-metallic expansion and contraction
principle to give a riﬂe-like make-and-break in elec-
trical contacts. It is an exclusive VVestinghouse

Westinghouse motors from heat‘ damage.

By Sam Rosenberg

Dr. ."'l'ohn“' A. Nietz ' associate’ rofessor in the
7 .

\

School of Education, by collecting aged text books,

has been unearthing the quaint procedure of teach-
ing that was a part of pioneer America.

Dr. Nietz has molded into his work a hobby that
makes him, daily, the recipient of letters that offer
books ranging in age from the present down to the
days of Henry the Eighth. A ' I

He considers no book less than fifty years old.

. “The philosophy behind the hobby,” stated D
Nietz, “is that by looking into the text books of
the past I can rcconstruc. the educational system 
early America, and thus get a more corrcc't View of
 scheols of the past.” '

, and north as far as New England.‘ “This one,’-’ he

said as he lifted it from the shelf, “had actually a
quarter of an inch of dust on it when I found ‘it in
New Orleans.” '

The content of the elementary reader (of which
the McGui‘fey is the most popular and 30 copies of
which are in the possession of Dr. Nietz) consists
of the alphabet, reading lessons, and the catechism.
The early geography contained no maps but there
was ‘an accompanying Atlas. A complete shelf in
Dr. Nietz’s ofﬁce is occupied by these geography
and Atlas books. A

As the elementary curricula increased arithmetic
and history were added. A typical problem in
arithmetic follows:

A gentleman a Chaife did buy,
 I-iorfé and Harnefs ‘too; .
They coft the Sum of three Score Pounds,
Upon  Word ’tis true;
The I-Iarnefs came to half th’ Horfe
The Horfe twice of the Chaife;
And if you’ﬁnd the Price of them
Take them and go your Way.

The shortest time element in engineering is probably
that encountered in short wave radio tube design -—
an allowance of 1/ 600,000,000 second for an electron
to travel a fraction of an inch.

A Westinghouse steel mill motor of this type can be
reversed from full ahead to full back in 5 seconds.

The -Westinghouse-equipped streamliner “City of
San Francisco” is one of the two most powerful
Diesel—electric locomotives in use at this writing—
5400 horsepower. Three years ago, the most powerful
train of this type was powered by a 1200 H.P. unit.
