SGB again denies funds for waterski club

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

Yesterday, the Student Govern-
ment Board denied for the third
time the Waterski Club's alloca-
tion’s request of $7,094.90 for
the leasing of a boat.

All Board members were
present for the vote except Board
member Pamela Rich who voted
the request down through proxy.

John Huber, next year's presi-

dent of the club, said he intends
on filing another protest.

”I'm going to keep filing it [pro-
tests] until everyone of the Board
hears my argument,” he said.
”Board members keep missing
meetings." I

According to Huber, three
months ago, the allocations com-
mittee approved $7,569.90 for
the club's leasing of a boat, since
then ”it’s been on the Board's
tabIe.”

’ ”This is the fourth time we've
seen this,” said Jackson. ”We al-
located them $3,000 to rent a
boat, lease a boat, anything they
could do. The idea is for them to
fund-raise the money to pick up
the rest."

”That [$3,000] is a pretty ludi-
crous asessment of the situation,”
said Huber. "We're not asking for
an.amount per person. We're ask-
ing for a piece of equipment that
is necessary for the survival of the

club.

Huber said that Joe Cavalla,
director of student activities,
Joyce Giangarlo and Terry Milla-
ni, associate directors of student
activities, recently met with him
about the allocation request and
suggested to the Board to reopen

their appeal. The Board agreed.

”The suggestion was also made

Group wants to lend a ‘helping hand’

By Lorey Kelley

For the Pitt News

A new organization. geared
toward community service is ac-
tively recruiting Pitt students who
are interested in lending a help-
ing hand.

”Our goal is to promote and
enhance knowledge of the com-
munity's needs through volun-
teerism and to serve as a clearing
house to match students with var-
ious social service organizations
in the area,” said Susan Schmid,
a Pitt student who is also the
group coordinator.

The idea for the organization
came about when Terry Millani,
associate director of Student Ac-
tivities, circulated a questionnaire

around campus asking students if
there were any activities not
offered on campus that they were
interested in and if so, would they
be willing to start a club for that
activity, according to Schmid.

Schmid and a few others ex-
pressed an interest in forming an
organization that would provide
volunteer services to the commu-
nity. They are currently attempt-
ing to get chartered with the
university so that they can have
access to student activities funds.
In order to be chartered, an or-
ganization must have 10
members.

”Getting chartered is tricky. It's
really like a catch-22. You need
funds to advertise for member-

l*;5I“;I:P):b7iU1.“‘Y9IJI nead:membershi.n:

~w'¢«b‘st

to get funding,” said Schmid,
who is a senior majoring in com-
munications.

Schmid said that the only re-
quirement necessary to partici-
pate in the community service
program is a willingness to work.

”We want members who are
more than just bodies,” said
Schmid.

The organization, which has
not yet been given an official
name, is researching the possibil-
ities of raising funds to provide
services for the following groups:
the homeless, the elderly, the
handicapped and hospitalized
children.

"As we get more students in-
terested, we will get more sugges-
tions. The organizations we

student interest and feasibility,”
said Schmid.

According to Schmid, student
interest is the key to the success
of this organization.

’’If everyone tried to do a cou-
ple hours, it isn't a whole lot of
effort, but it would make a differ-
ence,” said Christine Gould, a
Pitt student who is also a mem-
ber of the organization.

Schmid said, ”This is one way i

in which we grow: by helping
others.”

If any Pitt student or alumni is
interested in joining the commu-
nity service organization, they
can contact Susan Schmid at
361-2172 or the organizations’s
assistant coordinator, Polly Zer-

Iranian
ship in
fire fight

By Norman Black
AP Military Writer

WASHINGTON — Two Irani-
an navy frigates were attacked
and disabled Monday by Ameri-
can forces in the Persian Gulf af-
ter the Iranian ships fired missiles
at U.S. planes, the Pentagon said.

The Defense Department, in a
brief statement, said the latest in-
cident occurred around 9:40 a.m.
EDT, when an Iranian frigate
identified as the Sabalan fired on
A-6 Intruder attack jets from the
carrier Enterprise.

”The aircraft returned fire and
hit the Sabalan with a single laser-
guided bomb,” the Pentagon
added.

”As darkness fell, the Sabalan

was down by the stem with tugs

fore and aft. We do not intend to
renew attacks on the Sabalan un-
less she exhibits further hostile
intent.”

It was not immediately clear
precisely where in the Gulf the
confrontation occurred,

The fight with the Sabalan
came just 70 minutes after a simi-
lar confrontation with an identi-
cal frigate named the Sahand. It
also was attacked and set afi re af-
ter firing missiles at the U.S. air-
craft, the Pentagon said.

No American injuries or
casualties were reported.

The confrontation with the Sa-
hand occurred in the Strait of
Hormuz, the entrance to the Per-
sian Gulf, around 8:30 a.m. EDT,
about seven hours after the Unit-
ed States bombarded and des-
troyed two Iranian offshore
platforms, said Dan Howard, the
Pentagon's chief spokesman.

The battles with the two frigates
appeared to provide fresh evi-
dence that Iran
respond militarily around the
Gulf to the U.S. attack on its off-
shore platforms.

Earlier, an Iranian patrol boat ‘

was sunk after advancing on U.S.
warships; an American helicop-
ter came under fire from another
gunboat, and one U.S. warship
fired on two approaching Iranian
jetifighters, although it was un-

Israeli court: Demjanjuk is ‘Ivan the Terrible’

JERUSALEM —- An Israeli court
Monday found John Demjanjuk
guilty of being the Nazi death
camp guard ”lvan the Terrible,”
who sent hundreds of thousands
of Jews to their deaths in World
War II.

”We determine decisively and
without hesitation or doubt that
the accused John Demjanjuk
who is on trial before us, is Ivan,
known as ’lvan the Terrible,’ the
operator of gas chambers,” said
presiding Judge Dov Levine.

The finding came as Levine
continued to read the 450-page
summation of the verdict. The
reading entered its 11th hour
when Levine said "Demjanjuk was
”lvan the Terrible.” :

Demjanjuk, 68, was absent
from the court as the guilty ver-
dict was read. He listened from
an adjoining cell, where he lay
on a cot suffering from what his
family said was a back injury.

Demjanjuk could face the
death penalty if convicted of Nazi
war crimes, but observers have
said it was more likely he would
receive a life prison term when
he is sentenced at a later hearing.
Defense attorneys said they will
appeaL

The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk
was charged with war crimes,
crimes against the Jewish people
and crimes against humanity for
allegedly operating gas chambers
that killed 850,000 Jews at the
Treblinka death camp in Nazi-
occupied Poland in 1942 and
1943.

Levine indicated during his
summation that the judges gave
great weight to the testimony of
five survivors who identified
Demjanjuk as the Nazi death
camp guard ”lvan the Terrible.”

The question of identity has
been key during the 14-month tri-
al. Demjanjuk denies he is
”|van” and defense attorneys
questioned the memory of sur-
vivors.

Levine said survivors’ testimo-
ny had persuaded the court
”these experiences are deeply in-
grained on their memories, the
horrors are a deep part of them,
the sights are before their eyes
and the stories areitrue and ac-
curate.”

Polish-born Judge Zvi Tal also
rejected a defense contention that
”lvan” was killed during a
prisoner revolt in August 1943.

lnconsistences in Demjanjuk’s
testimony, Tal added, ”lead us
not to believe the version of the
accused that he spent 18
months [at a prisoner-of-war
camp] is totally unsupportable
and implausible.”

Amish give in, let
kids get measles shots

NEW WILMINGTON, Pa. -
Normally opposed to immuniza-
tions, Amish communities in
northwestern Pennsylvania have

clinics for shots to fight an out-

break of measles.

”Our concern right now is
mainly with the Amish,” said
Bruce Reimer, spokesman for the
state Health Department. ”Most
do not accept immunizations,
and our fear is that it will get into
other pockets of Amish.

”This is the time of year when
many will travel to other areas to
visit family and friends, and a lot
of weddings will be going on.
There is a potential for spread-
ing,” Reimer said.

Reimer said the first reports of
measles among Amish occurred
in Lawrence and Mercer counties
in early December. He said the
outbreak is apparently ”pretty
much nipped” after 142 con-
firmed cases in four months.

State officials believe the dis-
ease in northwestern Pennsylva-
nia was passed on to Amish
students who use public school
buses and vans for transportation
to their own schools, he said.

Commission calls for
major FAA changes

WASHINGTON —— A presiden-
tial commission called Monday
for major changes in the way the
government regulates the airlines,
including more inspections of air

carriers and appointment of an
aviation ”safety czar” with broad
authority.

After months of examining avi-
ation safety, the seven—member
panel concluded that ”the air
transportation system is safe" but
added ”safety is being main--
tained to an increasing extent
through delays and other incon-
veniences.”

And the commission said,
”While the [air transport] system
is safe for now, the present
governmental structure is not
working effectively enough to en-
sure its safety in the future."

The panel urged Congress to
enact legislation that would split
the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion away from the Transporta-
tion Department into an
independent agency with power
shared by an administrator and a
director of aviation safety.

This director would be ”in ef-
fect a ‘safety czar’ whose sole
responsibility would be to ensure
the safety of the [aviation] sys-
tem,” said John Albertine, the
commission’s chairman, in an-
nouncing the recommendations.

After recolonization, ZBT emerges as a strong house  

0 By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

Since the recolonization of
Zeta Beta Tau in fall of 1986, the
"new ZBTs" have been in the
process of making themselves a
strong force on Pitt’s campus.

This year alone, they had the
largest winter-term pledge class
of all the fraternities (10 pledges).
They did well in Greek Week,
placing third in charity contribu-
tions, first in the chariot race and
Greek God contest and first in in-
tramural basketball competition
between the fraternities.

ZBT’s membership has grown
from five "founding fathers” to
50 brothers.

They have their own house and
are planning a black-tie affair to
celebrate the charter they
received last month.

All of these accomplishments
have been achieved since the
’'old Zebes" had their charter
taken away in 1986,_ leaving a
shell of a house, an almost emp-
ty treasury and no real hope of
the ZBT being a strong house at
Pitt again.

Z‘

Pitt sophomore Mike Neuman,
one of the "founding fathers,”
said that during the 1986 Greek
"watermelon picnic” (which
offers students a chance to sign
up for rush), a representative from
the national chapter of ZBT was
standing among the other frater-
nities advocating the fraternity.
Neuman said he and his friends
went over to him to ask why he
was representing ZBT when there
was_n’t a ZBT chapter at Pitt
anymore.

"He told us he was looking for
a group of men to start a fraterni-
ty at Pitt to enrich their college
years and lives," said Neuman.

Sophomore Mike O'Brien,
another ”founding father” who
was with Neuman at the time,
said, ”We thought it would be
kind of neat to start our own
fraternity, so we made plans with
this rep and got things started.”

O'Brien said he and Neuman
were with a few, other men
whom they'd met during the ad-
vising session. They all decided
to get together and revive the ZBT
chapter. ,

”We figured if we started our

own fraternity, it would suit our
needs,” said O'Brien.

Neuman added that they had a
”strong network group” from the
beginning. ”We just kept meet-
ing new people and expanding
the organization.”

’’I never thought we'd be as ad-
vanced in the Greek system as we
are,” said O'Brien. ”| just think

we gave a lot of people a lot of

pride.”
Zeta Beta Tau did not receive

their house until the September
of 1987 due to a lack of organi-

zation and funds for upkeep.
When they did get their house
back from Pitt, "all that was

downstairs was the sofas that are

therenow," said Darren Wider,
the ZBT historian and chairman

of both purchasing and fund-

raising.
Wider said, ”Six of us put it all
together in about a week and a

half..I didn't open a book that en-
tire time. All I did was go to class

and work downstairs.”
Included in the needs for the

house were a new bar and tap
system, furniture, a pool table

and a paint iob.

"We started with nothing,”
said newly elected internal vice-
president Sam Teolis. ”Now it
seems like_ we have everything.”

”Once we got our house, it
really took a load off our backs,”
said Neuman. ”When we had no
access to our house, it led to a
lack of communication between
brothers. It was a big problem.”

Now that the brothers of ZBT
have rebuilt their house, they
have set their sights on increas-
ing their presence on campus.

"We plan on getting some
power inside,” said Neuman of
ZBT’s plans for the future. ”We
want to hold Greek Week chairs
and positions in IFC. We think
the Greek system is not that close
and could be closer. We have a
lot of good ideas to do that.”

Wider agreed. "We want
offices. In the past, it seems as
though the Greek system has
been run by a few fraternities. We
want to have our say, too."

Wider also added that he feels
Zeta Beta Tau’s relationship with
the other fraternities has been a
positive one.

”At first, the other fraternities

3

looked down on us,” said Wider.
”Now, we're on par with them."
Wider said one of the highest
compliments he got was from the
Phi Kappa Theta house.
”They’ve always been known
to wear their letters [Phi Kappa

Theta] a lot around campus," said I

Wider. ”One of the brothers said
that he'd noticed a lot of ZBT let-
ters around Pitt. He said we had
a lot of spirit and showed it. That
really meant a lot.”

The connections between the

I ”old Zebes” and the ”new ZBT”

chapter is nonexistent, according
to Neuman.

"The problems they had don't
exist here,” said Neuman.

"We really didn't know any-
thing about the history of ZBT un-
til we got involved,” said
O'Brien. ‘'1 was appalled at the
whole thing. It kind of turns me
off to see them [old ZBTs] wear-
ing letters around campus. It's not
that we don't care for them,
though, because we really don't
know them.”

Wider said, ”We don't have a
strong alumni group — if. any at
all.”

According to Karen Bohichik,

support the request was "very
strong.”

”We realized there was a need

the organization to fold,” she
said.

that they would certify the club

Huber.

It is refreshing to see that the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity has got-
ten itself reorganized. After the alleged improprieties concern-

, ing the old chapter's ﬁnances and accusations of continued drug

use at the house, the new ZBT group seems to have shaken
the image of the ”bad” fraternity.

Now, the new brothers have refurbished their house on the
hill, become involved in the Greek Week activities — winning
some -— and have made plans to pursue positions within the
Greek organization at Pitt. A r

We find it commendable that in the short space of two years,
the ‘new ZBT brothers have made such progress in getting_their
house in order. Hopefully, they will continue to improve their
organization and their contributions to Pitt greek life.

The administration
acted responsibly

Yesterday's daybreak ‘raid on two offshore oil platforms by
United States navy forces was a regrettable, but possibly un-
avoidable, new chapter in the Iranian-U.S. conflict saga. Dur-
ing the course of the battle yesterday, U.S. forces destroyed
at least four Iranian naval vessels and incapacitated the oil
platforms.

While an initial reaction of dismay at another military involve-
ment is an easy reaction, it would seem that there was some
justification in this case.

According to Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, the adminis-
tration obtained evidence that the mine which struck a U.S.
frigate on Thursday, injuring I0 U.S. servicemen, was of Irani-
an manufacture, and that it had been set by the Iranian mili-
tary. Having received this evidence, President Reagan decided
early yesterday morning to retaliate, after conferring with mem-
bers of his cabinet. . A

Before the order for the raid was given, Reagan consulted
various members of the Congress, including Democratic Majori-
ty Leader Robert Byrd. As a result of Reagan's willingness to
inform Congress of his decision, there has been nearly unani-
mous support for the action. . 

Assuming the evidence to which Carlucci referred is accurate,
there seems to be little else the United States, given its stated
position onterrorism, could have done. Apparently, judging
from the Iranian military response, in which the four Iranian
ships were destroyed, there will be a more serious reaction than
tothe October bombing.

We can only hope that the situation in the Persian Gulf does
not continue to worsen. The United States has committed it-
self to military action in hopes that a show of force will be suffi-
cient to halt the mining of international waters, that much is
unchangeable. We trust that the administration will continue

. to keep the Congress, as well as the Americanpeople, closely

informed of new developments.
Thus far, the administration has conducted itself admirably,
and we hope that behavior continues.

I'm writing in response to Marc
Duchin’s article ”Babies don't
grow on genetic trees” in the
Wednesday, April 6, 1988, issue
of The Pitt News. My initial
response was one of total dis-
belief. I am not sure what Mr. Du-
chin was basing his information
on, but it was obviously not fact.

As a bio-sci major and one who
intends to attend graduate school
for genetics, I have been keeping
up with the current research be-
ing done in the field today, and
I can assure you, Mr. Duchin, that
the goal of today's research is far
from having the ability and using
it to produce ”designer babies.”
As a matter of fact, the major
goals include such things as
reducing or even possibly
eliminating hideous afflictions
such as Down Syndrome, various
nerve disorders, i.e. Tay Sachs
Syndrome, dwarfism and many
others which can lead to early
deaths or a life of pain and
suffering.

Although you may not realize
it, scientists do have morals, per-
sonal and professional, which do
not lend themselves to creating
life for personal gains. The whole
idea of your suggesting that
research is being conducted for
the purposes of creating geniuses
or ”super athletes” is totally
absurd.

Before you condemn the
research being done, find out
about the facts, and the next time
you see a mother going into Chil-
dren’s Hospital with her child
that has no control of his or her
bodily functions or you read
statistics about the alarmingly
high percentage of children born
with Down Syndrome and other
birth defects each year, I want
you to think twice about it. Be it
a boy or a girl is not the main
concern here, but a happy viable
life is.

Buslane blues

It makes my heart sick to hear
our officials defend the bus lane
on the grounds that it does not
kill or cripple people very often.
Who's going to explain the eco-

LETTERS

nomic benefit of the counter-flow
bus lane to poor Mr. Rairick's
widow in the hospital? The
university and the hospitals have
made Oakland a national center
for science and medicine. Pitt is
the second largest employer in
the county, and Oakland has the
third largest bus ridership in the
state, behind only Philadelphia
and downtown Pittsburgh.

Pitt has enormous, power,
money and influence, but has ve-
hemently refused to lift a finger
to protect students from the dan-
gerous traffic on [Forbes and Fifth
Avenues.]. Every week, the
university buys more expensive
Oakland property, but they refuse
to back changes for pedestrian
safety such as full—stop walklights
or changes in the bus lane. None
of the further changes promoted
at public bus lane meetings three
years ago have been implement-
ed. They've put up a few railings
near the Towers, and in Septem-
ber they stenciled a few warnings
on the sidewalk. But incredibly,
last year, when Dr. Posvar went
on TV to complain about traffic
near his expensive house on
Darlington, it took the city less
than 24 hours to come [and] erect
stop signs.

The buslane is a constant
danger for anyone but even more
so here in Oakland. Oakland is
acommunity of young students
running to and from classes, old
people, hospital and psychiatric

patients, and visitors, all of whom

are more distracted and are more
likely to require extra caution on
the part of all drivers.

The buslane here is an absurd
cruelty, an insult to human car-
ing and concern. It was installed
without any debate or due
process; one day they just came
in and tore out all the meters on
the southern side of Fifth, and in
went the single bus lane. After six
years of school here, I don't know
how many times I've caught my-

self starting to take that step into-
.the buslane when I see no traffic

coming from one-way Fifth Ave.
The four lanes one way and the
long intervals without a bus cre-

ate a deadly illusion of safety,
while a bus is careening down
from behind. Why do we have it?
As Bill Millar of the Port Authori-
ty explains, the bus lane means
a lot to PAT: the buses move
through Oakland more easily,
they increase ridership, they keep
schedules more easily than when
all buses obeyed the regular
traffic laws and stayed on Forbes.
It means a lot of money to the

Port Authority, and by extension, ‘

it is argued, to all of Oakland.
But, where are our priorities?
Traffic of Fifth and Forbes was
never intolerable, we never had
one New York-style traffic jam,
even back when they were tear-
ing out streetcar tracks. What's
more important, the risk to hu-
man life or the small added an-
noyance of slightly slower traffic
and bus service back on Forbes?
The university is making a lot of
money in Oakland, Oakland
makes all its money from the
university, and PAT makes mil-
lions from both. But what good
is all the power and prestige ifwe
forget our most basic principle: to
love and care for each other?

People must come first. Wesley Q

Posvar and Bill Millar knew all
about the dangers of the buslane,

I and still they defend it, they de-

fend the reports of how it is eco-
nomically better for them, and
how relatively few the accidents
are. They could have changed
things if they wanted. Mr. Rai-
rick’s death is on the Wesley Pos-
vars. His death is on the Bill
Millars. This one is on everyone
who puts the value of a few dol-
lars over even one human life.

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, April I9, I988

 

Last Saturday, while recovering
from my usual Friday night drink-
ing binge (a guy's got to relax
somehow), I stopped by Mitch-
e||s' Restaurant in North Oakland
to have dinner.

After I ordered, I sat down, fac-
ing away from four nice girls (or
so I thought). I didn't feel like
looking at them because I was in

‘Va sullen mood. That's one of the
typical after-effects of drinking
heavily. And I'm your typical
masochist when it comes to feel-
ing lousy. I would rather sit
around and mope than do any-
thing to make myself feel better.

There was a big party taking
place in the bar side of Mitchells,
and by the looks of it, everyone
was getting sloshed.

The four girls who were sitting
adjacent to me in the dining
room appeared to be getting
sloshed as well. They weren't eat-
ing any food, and they had drinks
at their table. These four had
other devious plans.

While still contemplating how
to pass my final exams, why Pitt
didn't foul and how to entertain
myself that evening, one of these
four girls threw something on my
table. »

I didn't make a fast inspection
of the object because it appeared
to be a pack of matches. Why
these girls would throw matches
escaped me. I don’t even smoke.

After a minute of listening to
these young ladies giggle child-
ishly over their prank, I decided
to pick up the object.

To my surprise (this had never
happened to me before), the girls
had thrown a condom on my ta-
ble. Yes, the reading on the pack-

 

JOI-IN
ENRIGI-I'I'

age assured me comfort,
satisfaction and many other won-
derful sensations. I think the con-
dom was aptly called the Ultra
Satisfaction Condom. I wouldn't
know. I threw it away. I buy my
own condoms.

But I got hold of my senses, and
sat there trying to examine why
such good-looking bimbos would
do such a thing.

Now before the whole female
race gets on my back, let's try to
be realistic about this. I've pulled
my share of tasteless stunts in the
past, but I never did such an out-
rageous thing. Any girl who
throws a condom at a guy has to
be a bimbo, unless, of course, it's
her boyfriend she's throwing it at.

I could understand if these
puerile girls were in high school,
but I've seen three of them before
on campus. They must go to
school here. So I'd like to discuss
my four possibile conclusions
that have emanated from their
action.

0 Possibility No. 1: These four

They tried a new approach

bimbos really wanted it bad. Or
at least one of them did. But prob-
ably all four. Bimbos are all the
same.

0 Possibility No. 2: These bim-
bos wanted to hook up with me.
Well, girls, if you want to talk to
me, there's more proper ways to
go about it than tossing a con-
dom. I mean, really, I've heard of
both guys and girls moving in
fast, but this is ridiculous. I don't
proclaim to have a sacred past
myself, but I could never respect
a girl who picked me up by
throwing a prophylactic at me.

0 Possibility No. 3: These bim-
bos really are bimbos. You can't
blame them. I mean, if business
is that bad, you have to go after
it yourself.

0 Possibility No. 4: These girls
aren't bimbos. They're actually
honorable members of our soci-
ety who are promoting "Safe
Sex." 1

Yeah, that's the ticket. When
these girls get one good look at
debonaire types like me, they im-
mediately know we probably
stand a good chance to get it ev-
ery night.

They just want to make sure
we're taking adequate precau-
tions. That has to be the reason.
And I've been calling these
altruistic, pure, AIDS-conscious
types such filthy names as
bimbos.

My, oh my, how could I write

‘ such a thing?

Sorry, bimbos —— uhhhhhh,
girls —— keep up the good work.

chief of The Pitt News.

Afghan rebels will continue

First, a correction. A figure
which I gave in my opinion
column last Wednesday was mis-
quoted by $198 million. The
(Hekmaytar) Hezbe party
received $200 million in U.S. aid
last year, not $2 million.

Let's refresh our memories. In
my last column on the subject of
the Russian occupation of Af-
ghanistan, I made the assertion
that the public should keep an
eye on developments there. On
the next day — on the eve of the
signing of the socalled peace ac-
cords — Moscow sent 15,000
more troops into Afghanistan.
That raises their estimated troop
total" from 115,000 to 130,000.

I suppose if I were calling the
shots in Moscow, I may have

with that country. Our satellites
and human intelligence assets
can monitor such a movement,
but no one will stop such a
deployment.

Over the course of the last two
years, modern anti-aircraft
weapons filtered into rebel
hands. This caused the Red Army
to be more cautious about
deploying the feared helicopters
and jets, which changed the
scope of the whole war. Finally,
the rebels could regain some tac-
tical initiative.

evidenced by the widespread use

The crypt is a
monumental waste

Without sounding too in-
sensitive, what should we
do about the dead?

Seriously, for centuries
we have often chosen to
honor fallen comrades by
placing them in a box and
sticking them into the
ground.

But is this truly an
"honor"?

Aside from the implica-
tions of spending eternity

  

encased in a wooden
casket, there are the finan-
cial obligations as well.

The average casket runs
the bereaved approximate-
ly $1 ,500.Not to mention the expenses of buying a plot of land,
as well as the necessary tombstone.

With the pain of death upon oneself, it is almost ludicrous
to take on the monetary burdens of a costly resting place for
a loved one.

I am no stranger to death. And I am as emotional about it
as anyone; however, it seems like an enormous contradiction
to take a person who has lived, breathed and eventually died,

ing down at the ground.

Many times people request to have valuables placed with
them in the coffin for sentimental reasons; however, usually at
least five people are with the body between the time of the view-
ing and the actual burial.

Recognizing the fact that even in the funeral business that
there areypeople devoid of scruples, it is understandable that

never do.

It is important to note that the dead have ceased to exist. They,
quite frankly, should be as low a financial burden to the living
as possible. Considering this, expensive burials appear to be
an infeasible ritual to mark the end of life.

And while the fallen obviously cannot feel it, the eventual
decomposition of the body is a grim step associated with burials.

In no way am I saying that the dead do not deserve respect
and dignity in choosing how to lay them to rest. I ammerely
saying that there are better alternati-ves.

A more suitable means in my opinion is cremation.

With cremation, many of the above expenses are eliminat-
ed.. Subsequently, as the ashes are contained in a vase, this gives
a convenient, non-cumbersome reminder for the dead's loved

‘ones

In ancient times, the funeral pyres were considered an honora-
ble, proper means by which to lay one to rest. ’

Cremation is much less fiscally demanding to the living. As
a funeral package can run sometimes in excess of $10,000, this
process can run less than a few hundred. .

I know some people wouldargue that cost should be the last
thing in mind when paying one's last respects, but in our world,
it must be a consideration. Purchasing a casket with silk pil-
lows and a tombstone visible for miles around seems a bit much.
To cherish the dead is one thing. To seek extravagent means
to store them is another. . ‘

The population of our country is continually expanding. We
need the space to house the citizens of America.

The land used to accomodate the dead is not barren, useless,
contaminated space. It is well-groomed, and often strategically
located and valuable real estate. V ‘ .

There a_re numerous options appropriate to the use of pro-
posed cemetery grounds. When pondering a few of them, bu-
rial plots appear to be a waste. ' -

‘ lncities, use this space to create parks andtplaygrounds for
urban children and- adults. ' : .‘.':_g,;.§ -- ‘ . ..

While these types of moves by our government may not be
the complete answer to the problem, we must recognize the
eliminaton of cemeteries should be a serious consideration.

We need to acknowledge that the dead are in fact dead. They
have no materialistic, social or medical needs. The living do.

When deciding to zone off more land for yet another
cemetery, perhaps local governments could start the process
by considering a few of the points I've brought up.

We need to consider the living.

Ashes to ashes.

THE PITT NEws, Tuesday, April 19, 1988

By Jonathan Wolman
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — On the one
hand, Michael Dukakis has won
all of two elections in a row, and
on a good day, he draws maybe

half the crowd and a quarter of’

the enthusiasm of Jesse Jackson.
On the other hand, over the

Opast 12 days, Dukakis won an in-

visible primary the size of New
Jersey and quietly boosted his
claim on the Democratic
presidential nomination.

In the hiatus between Wiscon-
sin’s primary almost two weeks
ago and Tuesday's voting in New
York, Dukakis picked up pledges
from 105 national convention
delegates, and he won another

22 in
caucuses. .

”He’s being called ‘El Nuevo
Kennedy’ in the barrios around
Phoenix,” the governor's
Western coordinator, Richard
Ybarra, enthused after Dukakis
defeated Jackson and shut out
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. in Arizona.

All told, the Massachusetts
governor stretched his delegate
margin from a measly 36 to a
more substantial 134.

Where did all these delegates
come from?

Half came from Puerto Rico,
where Gov. Rafael Hernandez-
Colon delivered his blessing and
52 previously uncommitted
delegates.

But the 53 other pledges may

Saturday's Arizona

prove to be more significant, for
they may signify the first rum-
blings of an establishment

bandwagon.
They came from among the so-
called super delegates,

Democratic party leaders and
office-holders who are beholden‘
to no one and free to vote their
consciences — or to sniff the po-
litical winds. .

The nomination of Dukakis
seems all but inevitable —- except
when you consider that he faces
a stiff test from Jackson on Tues-
day in New York and his
872—delegate total remains far be-
low the 2,082 needed to win
nomination in Atlanta.

Dukakis, concerned that his
ethnic support may be soft and

his backers must be motivated to
vote, had some influential sur-
rogates campaigning in New
York City on Sunday.

He brought in one of the not-
so-nuevo Kennedys, Sen. Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts, for a
bring—out—the-vote effort, and af-
ter marching in a ”Salute to Is-
rael” parade, he attended a
Gaelic football game and a recep-
tion with Gov. Hernandez-Colon.

Yet for all the attention, New
York is not the only election be-
ing held Tuesday —— congression-
al Democrats will caucus
Tuesday and Wednesday to
choose their super delegates to
the'Atlanta convention.

Most members were ”nominat-
ed” in closed—door party meet-

‘Dukakis quietly boosts his leadover Jackson

ings last week, and Dukakis did
very well on both sides of the
Capitol, even in the Senate.

Most Senate delegates remain
uncommitted, but nine are lined
up with Dukakis. Gore picked up
just four pledges from his col-
leagues, as well as his own, and
Sen. Paul Simon — who dogged-
ly maintains a one—state strategy
—— had two pledges, his own and
that of fellow Illinois Sen. Alan
Dixon.

Jackson won no pledges from
the Senate, but fared better in the
House, where 142 member-
delegates are still uncommitted.
Dukakis has 26 pledges, Jackson
15, Gore 12 and Simon 10 (most
of them from Illinois).

Reagan warns Iran: ’...threaten us, they'll pay a price.’

WASHINGTON (AP) —~ Presi-
dent Reagan said Monday that
the American shelling of two Ira-
nian oil platforms should serve as

a warning to Iran that ”we will
protect our ships and, if they
threaten us, they'll pay a price.”

lusions about the cost of irrespon-
sible behavior," the president
said.

”We aim to deter further Irani-
an aggression, not provoke it,"
Reagan said. ”They must know
that we will protect our ships, and
if they threaten us, they'll pay a
price.”

Reagan's order to send the fleet
into action came after last week's
incident in which the Samuel B.
Roberts, a guided missile frigate,
was severely damaged + and

almost sank -— by a mine that
U.S. officials said had been fresh-
ly laid by Iranians. Ten American
sailors were injured.

His comments came at the start
of a previously scheduled speech .
in the Old Executive Office Build-
ing, next to the White House, to
members of the Associated
General Contractors.

The president said the United
States does desire a more normal
relationship with Iran, ”but such
a relationship is not possible so
long as Iran attacks neutral ships,

threatens its neighbors, supports
terrorism and refuses to end the
bloody war with Iraq.”

At the State Department,
spokesman Charles Redman said
that before today's retaliatory ac-
tion,Vthe United States had noti-
fied Britain, France, Italy, the
Netherlands and Belgium of its
intentions. All have naval vessels
in the Gulf.

Others, including the Soviet
Union, were notified at the time
the action commenced, Redman
said.

Pitt ready to build indoor sports facility

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

With the commitment the ath-
letic administration made to sign
football coach Mike Gottfried to
a long—term contract, the school
took the commitment a little bit
further.

In hopes to help all athletic
teams train during cold or incle-
ment weather, the University of
Pittsburgh has unveiled plans to

build a new indoor sports
complex.

”We would like to an-
nounce a new sports complex
that has been approved by the
university's board of trustees. We
are in the final design stages and
hope that contracts will be met
hopefully within the next
month,” said Athletic Director
Edward Bozik.

”The sports complex will be
built on top of a six—f|oor parking

Gottfried given new
multi—year contract
as Pitt head coach a

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

Over the past year, rumors
have circulated that Panther
coach Mike Gottfried may be
coaching elsewhere next season.
Well, Gottfried has laid any
speculation to rest.

The University of Pittsburgh an-
nounced yesterday that it has
signed Gottfried to a new long-
term, mu|ti—year contract.

”I have made the decision to
remain at the university for a
long—term commitment, one I'm
proud of,” said Gottfried. ’’Last
year, I felt a very strong need to
redefine my goals in the coach-
ing profession.

”_It’s always been my desire to
coach in the NFL, and I won't
deny that. The past year, my
name has been mentioned for an
NFL position and a couple of col-
lege situations,” remarked Gott-
fried, whose name was
mentioned for the head coaching
job for the NFL’s Green Bay Pack-
ers and the University of
Southern California and Ohio
State. '

Gottfried then referred to a let-
ter he received from the Chicago
Bears coach Mike Ditka, a form-
er Panther player.

”[The letter] gave me time to
reassess where I want to be,
where I wanted to be for the rest
of my life. It made an impact on
me,” said Gottfried. g

The letter read, ”You can estab-
lish yourself an identity that will

carry you through a coaching
career. You and Pitt can rise
together.”

”It meant a lot to me that he
would take the time to write to
me," added Gottfried.

Although terms of the contract
were not announced, one stipu-
lation was clear: Gottfried will
receive a potential bonus based
on the graduation rate of the foot-
ball players.

”We have talked to Mike over
several months about this com-

mitment,” said athletic director.

Dr. Edward Bozik. ”The contract
ties incentives into Mike's perfor-
mance and the performance of
his assistants that relates to the
athletic achievements of his
athletes.

”In this day and age where
winning becomes everything 
the long-term contract in collegi-
ate and professional coaching
takes the pressure off. It will take
the pressure off Mike and [will al-
low] him to build program over
a long period of time,” Bozik
said.

’’It enables [Gottfried] to build
the kind of stability we have long
sought  In Mike Gottfried, I
think we've got the right person
to provide that stability,” he
added.

Gottfried feels it's in the
school's best interest as well as
his own that he receive this type
of contract.

”It’s more of an agreement be-
tween both that there won't be a

Philadelphia sports teams not
at top of their game this year

By Ralph Bernstein
AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA — For
Philadelphia sports fans, it isn't
Paris in the springtime.

The Philadelphia Flyers are
out of the NHL playoffs.

The Philadelphia Phillies
last seven straight games.

The Philadelphia 76ers are
about to miss the NBA playoffs
for the first time in 14 years.

‘With this town's luck, the
Philadelphia Eagles probably
will catch a cold in Sunday's
NFL player draft.

And the Atlanta Braves were
concerned over a measly
10-game losing streak.

The Baltimore Orioles
should celebrate if they set an
American League record for
games last from the start of the
season. .

Philadelphia fans are so dis-
combobulated they don't
know which funeral to attend
first. ‘

Remember, this is a town in
which the Phillies. won the
World Series in 1980; the Ea-
gles played in Super Bowl XV
the same year; the Phillies
won the NL pennant in 1983;
and the 76ers took the NBA ti-
tle the same year.

This is the town Bill Giles
promised the team of the '80s,

when he organized the group‘
_that bought the Phillies in

1981.

This is the town Buddy Ryan
promised the NFL playoffs in
his first season, 1986.

This is the town the Flyers
took within one game of the
Stanley Cup championship
last year.

This is the town of Bobby
Clarke and Bernie Parent, Wilt
Chamberlain and Julius Erv—

- ing, Mike Schmidt and Robin

Roberts, Norm Van Brocklin
and Tommy McDonald.
Hey, what goes?,That’s what
callers to local radio talk—show
hosts Howard Eskin and Steve

Frederick want to know.
They have the telephone
lines to the shows ringing busy
with ideas about the Phillies,
Manager Lee Elia and pitcher
Shane Rawley, treating
listeners to such opinions as:
”Yo, Howard, the Phillies
lack fire. There's something

missing.”

”Yo, they ought to dump
that bum Elia.”

”Hey, Schmidt's had it.

Send Von Hayes back to the
American League.”

”Raw|ey couldn't pitchhis
way out of a paper bag.”

They have opinions on the
Flyers, goalie Ron Hextall’s
problems in the playoffs,
general manager Clarke and

in—the-pan. Tell Clarke he blew
it when he traded
McCrimmon.”

Three Panther soccer
players invited toplay 
in Poland for league

By Christopher Bosak

For The Pitt News

Three Pitt soccer players will
travel to Poland next month to
compete against Poland's junior
teams. The players are Mike
Blatz, Scott McCurry and Jay
Kapusta.

They are members of Western
Pennsylvania's summer league
Beadling team. The Beadling
squad, which is making the trip
to Poland, recruits the best soc-
cer players under the age of 19

in the area. The Pitt players are_

three of 11 freshmen from area
colleges on the team.

‘ 

Soccer there is like
football here; every-
thing revolves around
soccer.

—loe Luxbacher

Dennis Kohlmeyer, coach of
the Beadling team, ranks this
year's team in the Top 10 in the
nation. Kohlmeyer said the main
emphasis on the Poland trip is for
experience. He hopes the ex-
perience will help the team win
the McGwire Cup, which goes to
the best summer league team in
the eastern regionals.

”We have the ability to win the
cup,” Kohlmeyer said, "but
sometimes, you just need the

luck to go with it. I'm counting A

on the Pitt players to do big things
for us.”

The assistant coach for the Bea-
dling team is John Kowalski, the
former coach for the Pittsburgh
Spirit professional soccer team.

Pitt soccer coach Joe Lux-
bacher is keeping a close eye on
the three players’ trip. He is hap-
py they will face some good com-
petition.

”The whole thing will be a
good experience for them," Lux-
bacher said. ”Soccer there is like
football here; everything revolves
around soccer.” ‘

Luxbacher also expects a lot
from these players for next year's
Pitt team. Pitt hopes to improve
on last year's 4-10-1 record.

”We’re a young team with a
promising future,” Luxbacher
said, ”and these three will be a
big part of it. _

’’All are good players. Mike is
an attacking player, while Scott is
a very hard, tough, defensive
player. Jay shows a lot of poten-
tial as a goal keeper," Luxbacher
said.

The three look forward to the
competition they will face in
Poland, although they know it
will be very tough. They are also
excited to make the trip with Pitt
teammates.

”|t’s great to play with two
other guys from.the Pitt team,”
Blatz said. ’’I hope this ex-
perience will help us out for next
year's Pitt season.”

Blatz started in the mid—field for
Pitt last season. He also played
for the Beadling team last
summer.

”Conditioning is my weak
point right now,” Blatz said, ”but
skill—wise, I'm doing fine.”

McCurry also played for the
Beadling team last summer. He
started as an outside back for Pitt
last season.

”We’re in for a tough time in
Poland,” said McCurry. ”But the
competition can only help us.”

McCurry has high hopes for
next year's Pitt soccer season.

”We should have a better team
coming up. It will help that Dan
Liberatti is coming back. We'll be
more experienced,” McCurry
said.

’’I’m not the most skilled play-
er," McCurry said, "but I stay in
shape and have good endurance.
I'm a pretty sturdy player.”

Kapusta shared time at
goalkeeper last season for the
Panthers. He played in the South
United summer league last year.

’’I like dominating the air,”
Kapusta said. ”My size [6—foot-2]
is an advantage. It's better for a
goal keeper to be big. I just have
to concentrate more on the ball.”

Kapusta said of the Poland trip,
"I'm looking forward to it a lot.
But now I'm just working on get-
ting through these last two weeks
of school, then I can concentrate
fully on soccer.” 2

The Beadling team leaves for
Poland on May 20 and will stay
for about two weeks. They will
play in Warsaw, Krakow and one
other major city in Poland.

change at head coach.

”|t's a part of what we're doing
here, to tie in the graduation rate
with the contract. When I got into
coaching, I wouldn't do it any
different. When I see what hap-
pens out there, it hurts —— the
pressure to win, the pressure to
succeed, to put people in the
stands 

”To tie academic performance
in there is good. I think our
coaching staff knows it's some-
thing we have to do,” Gottfried
added.

Gottfried, 13-9-1 in his first two
years at Pitt, has pushed away his
goal to someday coach in the
NFL. He's grown attached to the
people in Pittsburgh and enjoys
his current situation.

”I had a goal to be an NFL
coach. I don't have that goal any-
more,” Gottfried said, bluntly.
”My goal is to remain at the
University of Pittsburgh, to be
here and to have a nice program,
to have a program we can be
proud of. Hopefully, I'll spend a
long time here.”

PANTHER NOTES: Gottfried
announced that he will donate
$50,000 for an endowed scholar-
ship for handicapped students to
attend the University of Pitts-
burgh. He will also donate an ad-
ditional $50,000 to help pay for
the construction of a new indoor
sports complex (see related story)
 Sports Information director Lar-
ry Eldridge has turned down a job
offer from ABC-TV and will re-
main at Pitt.

The total cost of the garage and

$13.5 million and is expected to
be completed by December of

Added to the athletic depart-

373-3331

By Vince Longo
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's tennis team,
10-10, ended the season on a
sour note Saturday with a pair of
6-3 losses to Mercyhurst and the
University of Buffalo, but with
four of the top six players return-
ing next season, the future is
bright.

”Any time you end up with a
.500 record, it's a good sign for
next year,” said Coach George
Dieffenbach. 7

’’Next year” rolls around the
third weekend of September
when the Panthers netters will
travel to Misquamicut, R.l., for
the Big East tournament. The
tourney favorite, as usual, will be
Boston College, which has won
it nine of the past 10 years. The
Panthers tied St. Johns for second
place in 1985, but what are their
chances next fall? Jeff Mills says
they're pretty good.

”We have a good foundation
for a couple years. We have a
really good shot at winning the

Big East title next fall.”

But Dieffenbach, ~while not
quite dismissing Mills’ bold
prediction as mere fantasy, is
more realistic, saying, ”We could
win it, we could do mediocre and
we could lose.” Dieffenbach
stressed that the Panthers will
have a shot at the Big East title,
but not exactly "a really good
shot.”

In singles action versus Mercy-
hurst, Neil Meyerowich lost to
Brian Demuth 4-6, 1-6; Jeff Mills
was downed by Gord Quinton
6-4, 3-6, 3-6; and Greg Campbell
defeated Raul Raymundo 6-2,
6-4.

Vivek Kumar fell to Tom Con-
rad 7-5, 1-6, 4-6; Paul Maben
won in three sets. over Tom
Pakulski 6-4, 4-6, 7-5; and Dan
Winicour lost to Donnough
Shaffrey 2-6, 4-6.

In doubles, Mills-Maben were
defeated by Demuth-Quinton
4-6, 2-6; Meyerowich-Campbell
beat Raymundo-Conrad 6-4, 6-1;
and Kumar-Winicour were beat-
en by Pakulski-Shaffrey 2-6, 4-6.

”Last year, Mercyhurst beat us

 

7-2, and this year they are ""’

stronger,” said Dieffenbach.
Against Buffalo, Meyerowich
—- who was voted MVP by his
teammates —- lost to Dave Giovi-
no 6-7, 3-6; Mills was downed by

Dave Schulefand 3-6, 6-4, 4-6; .
and Campbell lost to Mike Gibbs

6-7, 1-6.

Kumar was beaten by Mike
Kreider 4-6, 5-7; Maben garnered
his second victory of the
weekend with a 6-3, 6-3 win over
Rob Greguire; and Winicour lost
to Kevin Gardner 4-6, 3-6.

In doubles, Mills-Maben
defeated Giovino-Kreider 8-6;
Meyerowich-Campbell downed
Schulefand-Gibbs 8-6; and
Kumar-Winicour completed the
doubles sweep with an 8-5 vic-
tory over Greguire-Kirisits.

”[The season] turned out pret-
ty much like I thought it would,”
said Campbell. ”A couple of
matches that were rainedyout we
would have won.” .

Mills was upbeat, as well.

”I think overall we did fairly

well. There were a lot of learning
experiences, especially for me.”
