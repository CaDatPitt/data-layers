pleased that it will now be filled by such
a brilliant administrative and academic

Tuchi ‘said the main reason he accepted
the job at Pitt is because he is concerned
about the future of higher education. He
said when he grew up in the 19505,
universities were thriving and growing
institutions, but in the 1990s they are
constantly under more scrutiny and budget

1991‘-92 year of change

The 1:992‘school year at Pitt can be characterized as" one-of~

R<’«Vi€W

inspiring leadership and embarrassing scandal, of metamorphic
change and unifying tradition, of activist uprising and inactivist
complacency. It was a year of education, recreation, ‘experience
and development. . .
In that respect, at least, some things just never change. _
The activist season began with the last ‘ditch efforts of several
student»ar‘id city groups toxhaltithe imminent destruction, of the
Syria Mosque. Gay—rights and peace groups‘ pressured the O’Connor
administration to remove the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
from .campus. because of Departmentof Defense;:.:policies.,tha4t

Students for Peace held a cookie sale in an effort to defrayz_—_the' costs

of Oakland’s great landmarks, ROTC‘is still around in spite of its
violation of Pitt’s anti-discrimination policy, -and the PSfP only

Judging from the wide-range of scandals that punctuated the
past year, some Pitt organizations seem to be coming up a little
short in the integrity department. The former executive director
and president of the Golden Panthers athletic booster club were
arrested earlier this year for funnelling $41,627 into a private joint
bank account, while the former general manager of Food Services
and theformer director of Housing and Food Services were
indicted for diverting nearly $90,000 from DAKA, the company
which services Pitt’s cafeterias. V

Prof selection
divides music
department 0

By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

The question of who will fill an

empty seat in the music department
is causing internal conflict between
music faculty members, according
to music professor Dr. Nathan
Davis.

Disagreements began when the
question arose of who would
replace Professor Kwabena Nketia,
an internationally known and
respected expert on African music,
when he retired from'Pitt, Davis
said. _

Nketia was a professor in the
ethnomusicology department, and
it- was because of his expertise in
the field that many students came
to Pitt, according to Davis.

After the position opened up,

there was no effort made to find

another expert on African music
who could fill it, Davis said.

“There was a big political move
to de-emphasize the African
aspects of the program and to
generalize it,” he said. “There was

.a thrust to get a generalist, not an
Africaness.”

Davis said he is not referring to
the race ofthe professor at all; that
is not an issue. The issue is whether

V the person is knowledgeable about
African music.

When Nketia retired, the African
ethnomusicology position was
open. But instead of instantly

searching for another expert in the _

field, an attempt was made by
certain faculty members in the
music department to broaden the
search, Davis said.

There never should have been a
question whether we continued
the Africaness position or not, Davis
said.

‘‘If we would have been trying
to replace someone that taught
Jewish music, we would look for
somebody who is an expert in
Jewish music, not a generalist,”
Davis said.

The search committee was not
the cause of the disagreements,
and Davis said he places no blame
with them.

C The problem of violence against
women can be reduced by action
and awareness, according to
Majchael Tajchman, founder of
Men Against Rape and
Pornography.

“Awareness is one thing, but
how we behave in our everyday
lives is important, too,” he said.

with violence against women will
be sponsored by MARAP, the

School of Social Work,-Campus

14 women engineering students
at the University of Montreal in
1989. Brown examines the

“It’s important for other people
to have a grasp on what’s going
on with these issues in other
parts of the world,” said Gina
McFarlin, co-president of Pitt’s
Campus Women’s Organization.
“The Montreal femicide was a
more blatantexample of people's
reactions to feminism and women
who are trying to do something
with their lives,” she said.
McFarlin said many people are
not aware that violence against
women is a problem, especially
when the violence is not obvious.
“It’s almost worse when it’s not
so visible —— people think it

Students Win $250 prize
for completing survey

By John Temple
.S‘ta_[]“ Writer

Three students won $250 and a chance to meet Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs William Harmon after filling out
surveys distributed to residence-hall inhabitants by the Office
of Student Affairs.

Jason T omey and Tara Sullivan, who met Harmon at his
office yesterday, were randomly chosen out of the students
who filled out the surveys last fall. Chantal Kalan also won
money but was unable to meet Harmon.

The office decided to offer chances to win money to
persuade students to fill out the surveys.

“It’s a lot of money. We won’t have any paper clips for six
months,” said Dennis Donham, the assistant vice chancellor
for student affairs.

All three students opted to take .the cash prize rather than the
Pitt Program Council trip to Florida that was also
offered. .

“I would have taken the money, too,” I-Iarmon said.

The survey, first developed at the University of Georgia, was
designed to assess the characteristics of university students in
order to develop programs suited to them.

“Initially, the survey was to look at the quality of services
offered to students, but then we decided that we needed to
know the characteristics of the students that the programs will
involve,” Harmon said. '

Alpha Alpha
sorority suspended
by regional head

By Matt Goldstein
Stajf Wﬁter ' A

Pending an investigation
concerning illegal membership
activities, Pitt’s Alpha Kappa
Alpha sorority has been
suspended by the sorority’s
regional head. ,

According to AKA Vice
President Tiffany Ellis, the
investigation involves approx-
imately 15 inactive sisters,
including members who have
graduated from Pitt but who aren’t
official alumni of the sorority,
and the nine sisters who pledged
last semester when the activities
are believed to have _occurred.

The eight officially—active
sisters, including Ellis, were say
they were unaware at the time
that any such activities were going
on.

suspension but knew nothing
further of the investigation which
began on March 25.

In response to the decision,
Ellis said it was a shame for
“those of us who’ve worked hard
this past year to provide a service
to college women and African-
Americans on campus. Our work
has been jeopardized. Our
membership has been put on the
line because a few can’t follow
instructions. I believe their
concern for AKA was never
genuine.”

Ellis thinks a decision regarding
the sorority’s status may be made
by the fall, though nothing has
been confirmed.

‘Until then, all activities and
events have been put on
hold.

 

Pitt revises non-discrimination policy  

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor acknow-
ledged in a memo that the ROTC’s policy of
excluding gay, lesbian and bisexual students
violates Pitt's revised non-discriminatory policy.

“Note: ROTC programs discriminate against
students on the basis of sexual orientation, and
therefore, are not in compliance with the

university’s non-discrimination policy,”

O’Connor’s memo read.
The non-discrimination policy to be followed
by all university organizations now reads: “The

,University of Pittsburgh, as an educational

institution and as an employer, values equality of
opportunity, human dignity, and racial/ethnic
and cultural diversity. Accordingly, the university
prohibits and will not engage in discrimination
or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion,
national origin, ancestry, sex, age, marital status,
familial status, sexual orientation, disability or
status as a disabled veteran or a veteran of the

Vietnam era. Further, the university will continue

to take affirmative steps to support and advance;

these values, consistent with the university’s
mission. This policy applies to admissions,
employment, access to and treatment in university
programs and activities. This is a commitment
made by the university and is in accordance with
federal, state and/or local laws and regulations.”

“The statement gives a stronger, more positive
statement of policy with respect to nondiscrimin-

ation,” William Savage, assistant to the Chancellor I

and director of affirmative action, said.

The former non-discrimination policy said, “ 
[The university] does not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, religion, ethnicity, national
origin, age, sex, sexual orientation or marital,
veteran or handicapped status. This is a commit-
ment made by the university, and is in accordance
with federal, state and local laws and regulations.”

Savage said that the new beginning sentence
is to give foundation upon which the policy is
based. Using the word “harassment” makes
explicit that harassment is prohibited.

did a goodjob. The problem
wasn't with the search committee;
the problem was with certain
factions of the faculty,” Davis
said.

Founder of the
ethnomusicology program, Davis
said its original purpose was to
provide a place where anybody
from anywhere in the world could
come and study African and
African-American music .as well
as other forms of ethnic
music.

Not having an Africaness
professor defeats part of this
purpose, he said.

“I object to [hiring a generalist
professor] because I feel that we
have an 18- to 20-year tradition
of African music in the
department. 1 We have been a
leader in this area, so I think we

should continue to be,” Davis
said.

“The crucial thing here is that
that position should continue,”
Davis said. “Not only is it causing
a problem among the faculty,
but it’s causing a rift between the
students too,” Davis said.

African and African-American
students were not consulted as
much as they should have been,
Davis said.

He said the students feel their
opinions do not count, and they
will be the ones most affected by

99

the decision made since they will
be learning from the new
professor.

“If we are to become the future
scholars in our field, then certainly
we should be afforded the best
scholars and teachers to prepare
us, and certainly we should have
some meaningful impact in the
selection of that person,”
ethnomusicology student Clifford
Sykes said.

There is one student on the
search committee. However that
student is not in the

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 16, 1992

ethnomusicology program,
according to Davis.

Upon finding this out, Sykes
said, “That is a hideous infraction
of all fairness and justice to the
ethnomusicology students; that
is ignorant.

“We feel very strongly, those of
us who are Concentrating on
African music — we are the
people who will benefit the most
from the person to be appointed
—— that the person should be an
Africaness,” Sykes said.

Many music students come to
Pitt specifically to study with Davis
and Nketia because they are
world—renowned scholars. Now
that Nketia is gone, students feel
an Africaness should replace him,
Sykes said.

“[Nketia] is one of the top five

Sykes said.

It seems there is a movement
or a faction within the music
department that is contrary to the
idea of hiring an Africaness Sykes

CGS plans to continue
Pitt health investigation

By Kellie Burkett
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Continued investigation of the
stu dent-health fee was proposed
by the College ofGeneral Studies
Student Government Council at
the year’s last meeting.

Council members presented
and approved written
recommendations essential to
continue supporting the
traditional and non—traditional
student within CGS, said Marcie
Roberts, current president and
candidate.

“Most CGS students feel the
$46 a semester is a taxing fee that
they will never use,” Roberts said.
“Like myself, many students have
family physicians and have no
need for this service.”

The responses to a survey
conducted this semester by the
council showed that 59 percent
of full—time CGS students didn't
want to pay the health fee.

Over 70 percent said they have
never used any services provided

by Student Health.

The administration has been
very cooperative in trying to come
up with a solution, Roberts said,
adding that she hopes the issue
can be resolved within the next

yeah
The council also hopes to
continue supporting the

administration of justice/legal-
studies major within CGS.

“The A]/legal-studies field has
the fastest-growing student
population, yet the coursework
and overall program has been
shrinking,’_’ Roberts said.

Reinstating the paralegal
program and obtaining
American Bar Association
accreditation for the program are
suggestions supported by the
council.

Other recommendations
included developing a common-
sense safety guideline brochure,
maintaining progress on possible
phone-in registration and support
for the Coalition on Childcare
within the university.

BAS Steering Cornrnittee sets goals

By Alissa Smith
Staff Writer

With an entire school year ahead and new
members appointed, BAS’s Steering Committee
is setting high goals for the future.

The decision—making body, consisting of 12
recently-appointed members, is striving for a
commitment from the university to create a
Black Cultural Center — the implementation of
a financial-aid program equipped with peer
mentors and changes in the low graduation and
faculty rate for black students.

Political Action Chair Darryl Wiley said that the
atmosphere for African-American students at Pitt
is “not where [they] want it to be, but is changing. ”

Wiley said he is positive that the competence
of its new members, and the active roles they are
taking, will help BAS move in the right direction
for all black students. _

The committee hopes to make improvements
inside the BAS as well as throughout the
university. The new members are working to

make BAS more open to black students and
create more of a family atmosphere within the
organization.

Wiley said that the committee plans to do this
by making themselves more accessible to students
as well as making students more awareof the
organization’s accomplishments, goals and
benefits. “if you are a black student at Pitt, you
are already a membereof BAS,” Wiley said.

The committee is not putting boundaries around
the university. Wiley said that the committee is
striving to become more in, tune with the black
community in Pittsburgh. BAS plans to make the
surrounding areas of Pitt more accessible while
strengthening their own Community Outreach
Program.

Wiley said that black students should remember,
“They're not here because they’re a genius or
because the university wants them to be here.
T hey’re here because black people in the past
have shed blood for them to be where they are.
We must realize that we owe a lot to the black
community.”

Concerns for campus safety
dominated several heated SGB
meetings throughout the year. In
response to student fears after the
sexual assault of a Pitt student
this semester, the SGB installed a
new phone-dispatched Van—Call
system. Nowyamidst heightened
safety concerns following another
rape and two armed robberies,
the SGB and the Department of
Public Safety are still searching
for the solution to the campus-
safety problem.

The costs of renovations to
O’Connor’s office and residence
and those associated with his
installation ceremony total nearly
a half million dollars.

This year our campus was
graced by a number of
personalities from political, artistic
and scholarly circles. Margaret

l Reviewing the agenda

American universities occupy a special place in our
society. Critical cultural information is passed along to
generation after generation of students

However the University of Pittsburgh has afforded

students a richer, broader educational opportunity than .

anyone could ever have expected. Cultural experiences
are transmittedvin novel and innovative ways here at Pitt.

Violence in our society is not a myth; it happens in our
own backyard, or at least in the same building as the
campus police office. Last semester, while studying in the
very same building that houses our campus safety forces,
Forbes Quadrangle, a woman was dragged from the
building and sexually assaulted.

Campus safety has occupied the thoughts of students
and the promises of campus leaders and administrators.
However one fact remains: For over 20,000 students, only
two campus shuttles exist. Money is not appropriated for
essential student services. Speaking of appropriations,
students discovered a valuable lesson this year concerning
spending that should help decode some of the mess at
local, state and federal branches of government." Rather
than read political—science textbooks about budgetary
fiascoes, students read about a real-life one in The Pitt
News, Pittsburgh Post—Gazette andlPz'ttshurgh Press. . '

Outgoing Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s retirement
package startled administrators when the information
became public. The Board of Trustees were surprised to
find that Posvar received millions of dollars in benefits.

Continuing the tradition, incoming Pitt President-turned-
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s spending raised a few
eyebrows. First he remodeled his office, which cost
$82,000. Then the Board approved $300,000 in renovations

C to O’Connor’s home. Crowning the moment, O’Connor’s

installation cost $92,550 —— not too bad considering the
Pennsylvania is cutting expenditures for higher education.

University spending debacles continued throughout the
year. Pitt, whining that state funding is low, proceeded to
buy more property in Oakland and to deny the city of
Pittsburgh property taxes. Profits 1 from the Pitt Book
Center were used to purchase Oakland realty. Pitt even
bid against itself to purchase and destroy the Syria
Mosque. That’s putting student dollars to work.

The Mosque, now the dirt lot between Bigelow Boulevard
and Lytton Avenue, was once a cultural center in Oakland.
For over 80 years it served the Oakland and Pitt
communities. Holding graduations, celebrations and great
concerts, the Mosque offered a unique contribution to
campus, and it is missed. _ ‘

Money also set the tone for an interesting ethical issue.
Chancellor O’Connor chose to tolerate organizations
violating school policy and equal—opportunity commitment
by not setting a date by which the Reserve Officers’
Training Corps has to comply with Pitt’s standards. No
one asked the program to get out of town by sundown;
the University Senate only recommended a departure
date to put teeth to Pitt’s resolution to put an end to
conﬂict here. Apparently the Department of Defense
money can buy more than tanks.

Questionable finances, contradictions in messages,
scandal: the University of Pittsburgh offers more of an
education than one could ever imagine.

Fond aff

About a year ago, I was going through
the idyllic college-selection process. After
pouring through the catalogues, I listened
to the sales pitch that portrayed each
college as the ultimate. They each were
the ultimate in everything they offered.

But what kept me coming back to the
Pitt application was the pretty picture it
had on its cover. On a sunny day (Is it
really ever sunny in Pittsburgh?) a
photographer peeked discreetly through

the bushes upon a scene in front of the.

Union. There were students studying,
walking to class and socializing. But in the
center of the picture there were all types
of students: black, Latino, Asian, white,
female and male. And any one of them
could be queer. Inside the application, Pitt
asserted that it was the “ultimate" in
diversity. '
So, based on the ultimate application, I
made my ultimate decision and braced
myself for the ultimate experience.
Upon getting here, though, I found the
exact opposite. I found during my first
year here at Pitt, diversity is one ofthe key
buzz words. From the Cultural Diversity
Workshop to the College Diversity Panel

and on to the Cultural Diversity Fair and so _

forth  yet nothing seems to get done.
Racism, sexism and homophobia are some
of the driving forces that persists.
Chancellor O’Connor set the tone for
diversity and acceptance when he decided
to allow the most

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, April 16, 1992 '

Jpon my ultimate first year.

This year I got the ultimate card. No, it
was not a Citibank Visa or Mastercard —
not even an AT&T calling card. But my Pitt
ID. With it, I swear, came my entire life.
On it was the entrance sticker to my dorm,

Dr. O’Connor when
it comes to the merits of the ROTC program;
it definitely is an asset to the university
community. However it is in complete
violation of Pitt’s discriminatory code and
needs to be stopped unless it welcomes all
students to partake in its offerings.

But to see racism and sexism, one needs
only to look at any one of the bathroom
stalls around campus — or to the elevators
of Tower C. Every day of the year. I woke
up with a sick, aggressive remark that was
directed at any of the minority groups that
tries to exist on this campus. ,

But Pitt’s “diversity,” although an
important factor, only slightly infringed

Mistrusting campus police

As everyone knows, campus crime and, for that matter, crime

, my ultimate shelter,
ultimate food and ultimate entertainment.
Oh, yeah; it also enabled me to check
things outof the library.

Once a week the inevitable happened:
I'd lose my precious lifeline. You could
find me at three in the morning, running
around Oakland trying to retrace my steps

' in an effort to find my ID.

This year was also filled with too many
social get—togethers (there were never
enough people to call it a party), where at
any given minute someone in Oakland is
getting drunk or doing whatever else. The
entire campus is a collection of wacky
people. Case in point: In this year of hard

ectionsfor student ID remembered

economic times, the ULTIMATE party
school threw a $92,000 schebam to
celebrate our new chancellor. Here’s to
the ultimate —— Dr. J. Dennis O’Connor.

I discovered the ultimate driving
experience (or lack thereof) this year. I’d
use the PAT buses to go to friends’ houses,
shopping and entertainment. It was a
disappointment when they decided to do
this strike thing. What did it get us? A
bunch of lost commuters, a couple of bus
drivers -who lived a couple of weeks
without pay and a whiny first—year student.

But to truly take part in the first-year
experience, I’d have to drown myself in
Pitt’s'“ultimate” bureaucracy. After starting
in the engineering school, I switched to
CAS, changed my major, withdrew from
classes, add-dropped  and so on. After
all that B.S., =1 am officially initiated as the
ultimate Pitt student.

But ultimately, there are some decent
things about Pitt——— some really interesting
people, some all right classes and perhaps
an ultimate bowl game next year!

Scott “the Scooter” Nespor is a columnist
forThe Pitt News.

C0lumnist’s prejudice unveiled

in general is not going down. It seems that criminals are getting
away with “murder” — more specifically rapes and armed
robberies. Patrolling problem areas is not enough. Is this going
to make a difference? We will have to wait and see. Crime on
this campus and in the city of Pittsburgh will never cease.

Charles Jacobson

Pittsburgh is a -large, metropolitan area; crime is to be expected.

' However campus crime is something that did not just happen

or appear one day on the doorstep of the William Pitt Union,
like an abandoned child. The two consecutive robberies tha,'t
happened twoweeks ago weren’t flukes. ~. - l . - - 

Our universitysresponse has been to post alerts. These
crime-alert bulletins that are posted on some bulletin boards go
unnoticed. Usually they are next to ads from people trying to
sell textbooks and mountain bikes. Subsequently, we have
book and bike buyers informed about incidents.

In the Monday, April 6, issue of The Pitt News, public—safety
officials and some Student Government Board members said
that apathy is to blame. Board member Christopher Skutches
went on to say, “We have [safety forumsl, and no one shows
up." Seemingly out of frustration, he went on to ask if the Pitt
police should go door to door, giving out personal workshops
.to increase student response. .

In the same article, Student Government Board member Dan
Leichter said he felt that the student body doesn’t care or show
an interest. However these individuals ignore the underlying
reason for the poor turnout. Students who don't feel safe here
have just lost confidence in the campus-police force. Incidents
like last semester’s DUI incident —— reported in the October 10
issue of, The Pitt News— in which a campus-police officer led
city police on a three-block chase, are not easily forgotten.

Undermining confidence in the campus-police force is a
ritual I observe routinely. Studying at various times in the
library, I often take a break togo to the 7—Eleven on Forbes Ave.
On such a Tuesday or Wednesday, around such times as 9 or
12, I have often seen Pitt police enjoying a cup of coffee. This
is great for the 7—Eleven; it will never get held up. But it doesn’t
say much for the doubling of patrols around problem areas.
People cannot be at two places at once; it is either the
convenience store or the hill. According to my surveillance, it
is the convenience store. Another great piece of advice from the
campus authorities is to wait for the shuttles. Students should
do this so they do not have toventure home alone. This does
not always work. I, as a victim of being stranded.

Unfortunately, the only way to be somewhat safe is to come
home during daylight and watch the alcohol consumption
when going out at night. People come to college to learn but
also to have fun — not to get mugged or even raped. The Pitt
police have repeatedly said that there has to be a partnership
between us, the students, and them. First things first — I think
that they are going to have to earn back our trust before we start
listening to what the police call “reason.” Until this time, if
students are in potential trouble, try running to the 7—Eleven. It
might not be a bad idea.

identifiable member of a group

I am writing in response to Joe Babinsack’
column in Monday’ Pitt News. In the middle of
column that seems to insult everybody, he offers
the following definition of homosexual: “an uneasily

as being a “Native or inhabitant of one of serveral
social groups which practice arrogance, elitism,
and plutocracy on any one of the univerisities in the
United States of America.”

' The ironic part of his

with a different sexual orientation
who radically demands to be
treated similarly and won’t stop

inaccurate definition is that in the
_ same issue there is an article that
announces the $125,000.00 that

letting everyone know how
different they are.” As a queer person, who would
probably fit Mr. Babinsack’s definition of a
homosexual, I have several criticism of this deﬁnition.

First, Mr Babinsacﬁildefines a homosexual as a.

person with a “different sexual orientation.’ I am
forced to ask, different from what? I am not a
heterosexual, and heterosexual people are, in some
ways, different from me. Aren’t they then persons
with a “different” sexual orientation? I seems that
Mr. Babinsack believes that societal standards, such
as being white, heterosexual or male, are natural
and anything else is “different,” and not quite as
legitimate. *

Secondly, Mr. Babinsack says that we radically
demand to be treated similarly. Similar to what?
Probably the “normal” heterosexual majority that
we are not a part of (I am assuming that he includes
bisexuals, and other queer people in his definition
of homosexual, since we all are “different"). Since
when is demanding equal rights radical? Of course,
the status quo that is threatened by an oppressed
group demanding equality is going to label that
group and its leaders “radical”, such as Susan B.
Anthony and Martin Luthar King Jr.

Finally, Mr. Babinsack says that we “won’t stop
letting everyone know how different” we are. He
forgot a definition in his column- “assimilationist”.
An assimilationist is someone who thinks that
people should only be treated with respect if they
fit into mainstream culture. During the Civil Rights
movement of the 60's many people thought blacks
should try to work hard and imitate “white” values
to be accepted and gain their rights. Unfortunately,
some people still think that today, and not just
about blacks. People should be allowed to be
different and still deserve respect.

This brings up an interesting point. Joe Babinsack
is the president of St.A.R.(Students Against Racism).
It may surprise Mr. Babinsack to know that many
black people are ‘homosexual’. Perhaps he should
rename the organization “Students Against the
Opprestion of Heterosexual People of Color”. St.A.R.
should be embarrassed to have this person as the
president of their group. ‘

Lifers really lead a Pro-Death movement

I cannot speak for anyone else, but I am sick of
the hypocrisy of the “Right to Life” movement. All
of their talk of the sanctity of human life is just wind
blowing to support their program. Personally, I
think that their movement is the first in a series of
onslaughts against the few human rights that women
have managed to wrest from the hands of politicians.

If they want to base their movement on their
religious faith, then we can have no argument. And

they have no right to tell women whether to abort .

or not. Just as they do not want anyone telling them
how to worship, then their religious viewpoint
should not be used to make legislation regarding
abortion. Women should have the options presently
available (and more); no religious zealots should
program reproduction for others.

I truly believe that removing a woman's right to
choose is the first step in reproductive control. First,
they will tell women that they cannot choose to
abort, and next they will be telling them when to
have babies and, perhaps, who to have them with.
You may well think I have gone around the bend
by now, but consider the “Right to Lifers”’ other
viewpoints on life. A

Have you ever met one not in favor of the death
penalty? How many of them have you heard saying
that welfare mothers should be sterilized? -I’ve
heard some say they would like to see those that
run [abortion] clinics killed. If fact, some see
nothing wrong with blowing up clinics with the
staff and patients inside. , _

Most importantly, they shout all about the “poor
babies killed since Roev. Wade,” yet ignore a bigger
killer — hunger. Each day over 40,000 children
worldwide die from starvation. That’s 292 million
since Roe v. Wadewent into effectin 1973. So if the
efforts of the anti-"a‘B’o'rtio"nists"included fighting
hunger and poverty in America and worldwide, I
might feel better about their movement. But until
then I will continue to believe it is nothing but a
front for pushing their religious beliefs down the
throats of American women.

Men’s track warms up for Penn Relays

By Bill Karahalios
Smﬂ‘ Writer

Pitt’s men’s outdoor track and field team
had its final tuneup in the Dogwood
Relays at the University of Tennessee
before it heads for the Penn Relays, held
in Philadelphia on the campus of the
University of Pennsylvania.

According to head coach John Vasvary,
it is the biggest meet of the year for the
Panthers. “The Penn Relays are the biggest
track and field meet our kids ever run in,’f

he said. “All the major conferences in the ,

country will be represented.”

Gilbert impressi

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

In a recent workout for NFL scouts, Pitt’s
Sean Gilbert ran a 4.84—second 40-yard
dash. Not bad, especially when you
consider that the 6-foot, 6-inch Gilbert
weighs over 500 pounds.

There are certain things that athletic
coaches can’t teach, no matter how good
they are at their given profession. Size and

. speed are among those uncoachable

attributes. Gilbert has both of them. That’s

why he’s expected to be drafted in the first

round of the upcoming NFL draft.
Gilbert, 22, was a highly touted prospect

coming out of high school. In fact, he was :

Year in 1988. He was also a Parade All-
American that year. However at Pitt he

never quite lived up to his expectations 

because he was frequently beset by injuries.

Of course, he had to sit out his first year '

due to Proposition 48. As a sophomore, he
played in only six games and recorded 54
tackles, including 19 unassisted.

Because of injuries, Gilbert only played
in seven games last season, but he still
managed to collect 65 tackles, 37 of which
were unassisted. He was the team’s fifth-
leading tackler. That’s quite impressive
when you consider that all the players
who made more tackles had played in all
11 games. Once again, Gilbert saved his
best for last. His most outstanding effort
occurred in the finale versus Penn State,
where, in front of a nationaltelevision
audience, he made 11 tackles, had two
sacks‘,and recovered a fumble.

Though Gilbert saw limited action, he

still earned several postseason honors. He

Pitt tradition, will feature men and women
from colleges, high schools and elementary
schools participating in this 100-year old
event

Fifty thousand people will pack the
stadium, and it will be aired by ESPN the
weekend of April 24.

Meanwhile Pitt’s performance in the.

Dogwood Relays wasn’t what Vasvary
anticipated. “It wasn’t too bad, but we
obviously need better performances,” he
said.

In the preliminaries, Devvon Bradley
finished third in the 800-meter run with a

time of 1:57.12. Mike Umbleby ﬁnished
fourth in the 1,SOO—me_ter run at 4:01.28,
and the shuttle-relay team finished third
with its best time of the year.

In the finals, senior-Jim Hamilton placed
ninth in the S,O0O—meter' run at 14:47.91,
and fellow senior Brett Shields placed
fourth in the 110—meter hurdles with a
time of 14.28.

While many Panthers were in the top 10
in the preliminaries, only two advanced to
the - finals.

“Everybody was doing what they’ve
been doing, but we were hoping to be a
little better," Vasvary said.

Jeannie Vecchio and Kristin
Brown completed the last leg
of their 1992 campaign last
weekend at the NCAA Northeast
Regional competition held at
State College.

Both of Pitt’s gymnasts
consistently performed strongly
throughout the best of the
competition. However, for
Vecchio, there still remains a
glimmer of hope for the NCAA
National competition. Vecchio’s
qualifying score of 37. S0 placed
her in the number-six spot of
the alternate all-around
competitors for nationals.

There are 12 independent,
all-around competitors that
compete in nationals outside of
the teams that qualify. If any of

those gymnasts declines to
compete, then a spot opens up
for a gymnast on the alternate
list.

There, remains an off-set
chance that Vecchio could be
called upon to compete, but
the chances of that happening

' are unlikely.

Vecchio’s performance at
Regionals was that of a well—
seasoned competitor. Vecchio
is unique in her attitude towards
competition. When competing
with the Lady Panthers, Vecchio
does what is best for the team.

If a trick is not ready and she
has not had the time to really
work on it, she will not preform
it in competition with the team.
For Vecchio the team comes
first. Although she was
competing as an independent,
all-.around competitor, she still

had her mind on the Lady
Panthers.

‘'1 was happy with what I
did,” said Vecchio. “The tricks
I did weren’t consistent [during
Pitt’s season], but I was
conﬁdent with [the tricks] I was
doing.”

While competing in regionals
Vecchio performed a
handspring front vault and
scored .a 9.35 — her career
high. Vecchio has always been
an extremely strong uneven
parallel bars competitor, but at
regionals her strong consistent
performance earned only a
score of 9.55.

“The scores were a little low,
but at that level you just don’t
turn in an inquiry,” said Debbie
Yohman. “Justbecause you turn
in an inquiry doesn’t mean the

-The Steelers continue to refuse
to adjust to the talent on the
roster. They have three
outstanding, young, defensive
players to try to get on the field
together in Greg Lloyd, ‘Jerrol
Williams and Huey Richardson
— all natural outside linebackers.
Last season they tried to moye
Richardson inside, and the”result
was a wasted rookie season for

Ryan
Buncher

the top pick. Now instead of
changing the defensive scheme
to fit them in, Lloyd is being
moved to inside linebacker.

This is not to say that he won’t
be a great inside linebacker; he
might be.

The team could definitely use
the help inside, with David Little
coming off a tough season at age
33, Hardy Nickerson unsigned
andjerry Olsavsky unproven. The

problem is that with the exception
of all-pro cornerback Rod
Woodson, Lloyd is the team’s
best defensive player.

Some people were even
comparing him to the Saints’ All-
Pro Pat Swilling as one of the best
in the business.

to sprint in from the outside to
destroy the ballcarrier in the

Williams was ready last year,
but what about Richardson? He
missed much of last season with
injuries and hasn’t played outside
linebacker in two years —— not at
all in the NFL.

If he falters, Bryan Hinkle steps
back in as a starter outside. Gutty
veteran Hinkle is still a solid
player despite having lost a step
last season, but how much can he
have left?

The Steelers may end up with

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Thursday, April 16, 1992

O 7 ‘ > I
A 7; inside
By Michael Milliron
Staff Writer
_ ll

This year’s National Football
League draft (orAnnual Selection
Meeting, in league jargon) will be
conducted on April 26 and 27.
ESPN will begin its coveragerof
the draft at 11 am. Sunday. It
appears to be a very good draft

» for defensive linemen, defensive

backs and offensive tackles.

As usual, experts’ opinions on
the 1992 crop of players differ.
Undoubtedly the number of
underclassmen coming out has
increased the talent pool. Draftnik
Mel Kiper, ]r., feels that fourth-
and fifth—round selections in ’92
are as good as second- and third-
round picks in ’91. Draftnik Joel
Buchsbaum feels that this draft
lacks strength and depth, and the
infusion of juniors has made the
’92 draft overrated.

Many Pitt players figure
prominently in the first couple
rounds. The most enticing is

look at the NFL draft

defensive lineman Sean Gilbert,
who has decided to give up his
final year of eligibility. Gilbert is
the only Panther considered a
sure number-one pick. The 6-
foot, 5-inch, 315 pounder ran a
4.84 second 40 in private
workouts for scouts a few weeks
ago and did 22 reps at 225 pounds
at the scouting combine in
Indianapolis.

“He has helped himself a great
deal,” said New York Giants
General Manager George Young.
“He is a tough, good football
player. When I saw him against
West Virginia I thought he was
the best lineman on the field. He
is an outstanding prospect.”

Chicago Bears’ Assistant
Director of Player Personnel Rod
Graves agreed. “He’s got a good
chance to be an impressive player
at our level. He really impressed
in the Pitt—Penn State game,”
Graves said.

Other Pitt prospects who ﬁgure
to be off the board by the third

round are defensive end Keith
Hamilton (like Gilbert, giving up
his final year of eligibility),
linebacker Ricardo McDonald and
defensive back Steve Israel. Kiper
and Buchsbaum both have
Hamilton and McDonald going
in the second round of their
mock drafts. NFL scouts like
Hamilton’s pass-rushing ability.
Graves said, “Hamilton has a lot
of potential. It depends on him.”
Young added, “When he was a
freshman, I thought he was the
most exciting player on their
lPitt’sl team.” _
McDonald’s consistency has
enamored scouts. “I don’t know
that he’s missed a game in his
four years there,” Graves said.
“The kid has a lot of physical
ability and is a good pass rusher.”
There is some doubt about
McDonald’s pass-coverage ability,
and that is what may keep him
out of the first round. “He’s a
good blitzer, but we're not sure

was named to the Big East All-
Conference first team as well as
the the Associated Press All-East

second team.

Several newspapers and
magazines have published mock
drafts in which they predict where
a player will be chosen. All the

in the first round. I’ve seen him

listed as going as high as third
and as low as 12th.

The Indianapolis Colts have
the draft’s top two picks and have
suggested that they'll take
Washington defensive tackle
Steve Emtman and Michigan
receiver Desmond Howard, the
1991 Heisman Trophy winner.

ESPN draftnik Mel Kiper expects
the Los Angeles Rams to select
Gilbert with the third pick.

“Gilbert’s a great player,” said
Kiper, who publishes an annual
draft report.

Draftnik Joel Buchsbaum, a
contributing editor for Pro
Football Weekly, said he also sees
Gilbert as a high, first—round draft
pick. I

“lHe has] great size, strength,
athletic ability [and is] a good
leader,” Buchsbaum said. “lHe’s

score is going to change. At
that level a score is a score.”

Vecchio’s‘ shining moment
came while she was competing
on the balance beam. Four
years ago, Vecchio held Pitt's
school beam record of 9.50
but lost it to teammates Brown
and Gina Venezia.

Vecchio’s beam
performance scored a 9.65 and
allowed her to join Brown and
Venezia as holders of Pitt’s
beam record. This was also
the first regional competition
that Vecchio did have a fall
from the beam.

Vecchio’s final event was
the floor exercises, where she
added the double-back ﬂip
that she has not performed in
competition since her senior
year at Fox Chapel High
School. Vecchio’s floor routine
earned her a 9.625.

Vecchio earned a 38.125 in
the all-around event and the
seventh seed of 27 all-around
competitors, while teammate
Brown scored a 36.575 in the
all-around event and the 23
seed.

The regional competition
was a good challenge for
Brown.‘ She was able to go
into a highly competitive arena
and compete a. strong,
consistent all-around

. performance.

Brown had an extremely

,;good warm up and held

together throughout her first

individual regional
performance.
Brown started the

competition on her least
favorite event — the balance
beam.

Although Brown is one of
the three—school record-
holders on this event, she feels
that it is the hardest event
because it requires a great
deal of control.

Brown fell from the beam
on her mount because she
pulled up too quickly after
landing ‘on the beam. She
scored a 8.775 on the beam.

After the beam event Brown
moved onto the floor, which
is one of her favorite events.
Brown performed a very
consistent floor routine, and
scored a 9.575. Yohman said
she" felt that it wasn’t Brown’s
best routine. ‘

Next Brown moved to the
event that she has had the
most laughs with — the vault.
According to Kristin “I Need A
Vault” Brown, vaulting is not i
a really bad event so long as
you have a vault.

“I had challenged her while
vaulting,” said Yohman, “I told
her to just to do the vault as

_ best she could.”

Brown scored a 8.85 for her
vault. Brown’s final event
found her on the uneven
parallel bars. She scored a
9.35 for her bar routine.

THE prrr NEWS, Thursday, April 16, 1992

 

  Buncher

Continued from page 10
capped by a big game against
Penn State. Sean Gilbert came
in as a higher-rated prospect,
then sat out a year due to prop
48.

In the two years he actually
played for Pitt, he was injured
most of the time and didn’t
really show the dominance
expected of him until the Penn
State game. Then he left early.

Since then McDonald’s stock
continues to drop. He is
currently rated as a second-
round pick, and yesterday’s USA
Today said he is dropping.
Gilbert has moved up and is
being rated just behind
consensus top prospect Steve
Emtman. He might go as high
as third to the LA. Rams. Then
the Rams came up with _a novel
approach; they actually
watched tapes of some of
Gilbert’s games in college.
Suddenly they aren’t so high on
him.

The kind of thinking that

makes Gilbert a top prospect and
McDonald a second-rounder is
what has killed the Steelers in
recent years. Aaron Jones was
not a dominant college player
despite playing at a small school,
yet the Steelers took a chance on
a quality athlete whose stock
rose after his college playing days
were over. They got burned.

Tim Worley had a good college
career, but it was his athletic
ability, not production, that sold
the Steelers on him. Yet again
they got burned. Eric Green was
a gamble on an athlete, but at
least he dominated when he
competed against lesser talent in
college. .

The Steelers have got to start
drafting good football players —
not just athletes.

Looking at available players, I
will say it for the lasttime: Carl
Pickens is the man. All indications
are that he will be available when
the Steelers come up in the 11th
spot

This guy is not a burner on the

level of Desmond Howard, but
he can make the big plays. He
has speed, size, moves and
hands reminiscent of former
Steeler greatjohn Stallworth, so
who better to fill the void
opposite Louis Lipps, which has
remained open since Stallworth
retired?

Recent talk has been that
halfback is more of a need than
receiver due to the presence of
Jeff Graham and Ernie Mills, but
Barry Foster did a hell of a lot
more at halfback last season
than Graham or Mills did at
receiver. He fits in very well
with the pound-it-out running
game that new offensive
coordinator Ron Earhart favors.
The team might be better off
sticking with players who have

shown that they can get the job V

done.

Another player who could fit
in very well is Stanfordfullback
Tom Vardell. A

He is a borderline first-
rounder, but if he slips to the

Steelers in the second round,
they should grab him. Another
quality player who has been
talked of as a first-round pick
but is suffering from falling
stock is Greg Skrepenak, who
could be a great replacement
for Tunch llkin at right tackle
as a part ofPittsburgh’s getting
bigger up front.

In later rounds, taking a
chance on a quarterback could
be a good idea. Two prominent
trigger men who could be
around come the third round
are Tony Sacca of Penn State
and Casey Weldon of Florida
State.

_ Sacca is the prototype QB,
but he continually chaffed in
the conservative offensive
system of Joe Paterno’s team
and would probably do the
same in the pros. Weldon is far
from the prototype, but he
moves his team and wins. Hey,
this guy even looks a little like

Joe Montana, so what more do I
.you want?

Williams and Tom Tumulty are
young, as are Doug Whaley and
Curtis Martin. Even seniors Lex
Perkins and Rob Coons are just in
their second year of playing at
Pitt. So here I am, thinking many
of the same things that were
written a year ago, telling Pitt
fans to “be patient.” Just don’t do

it quietly. I
-Item: The Kentucky Supreme

Court ruled that the University of I

Kentucky must release its report
on the NCAA’s investigation of
the Wildcat basketball program
to the public in 20 days.

This report, a document
totalling some 4,000 pages, could
do some serious damage to Eddie
Sutton, the former UK coach and
currently the mentor at Oklahoma
State. Sutton resigned in 1989
after two of his players, Eric

Manuel and Chris Mills, were-

banned from playing at Kentucky.
Manuel, who got a raw deal,
ended up at NAIA school
Oklahoma City, while Mills plays
for Arizona. The public has a
right to see what caused the NCAA
to hit UK with three years of
probation. After Kentucky tried
to shore up its image in the past
few years, it would beconsistent
with the new ideals in the UK
athletic department to open the
records. ,

0 Item: Manhattan hoops Coach

Steve Lappas, a former Villanova .

assistant, looks to be the new
head man at ‘Nova, replacing no
one’s coach of the year, Rollie
Massimino.

What is there to say? I like
Lappas’ style, and I was impressed
with his results at Manhattan.
Anybody’s better than Rollie.

Activists for Social Change

THE ptrr NEWS, Thursday, April 16, 1992

Draft
Continued from page 11
about his pass drops,” Young said.

Opinions differ on Israel. Buchsbaum

has him going in the first round due to his

'43-second 40, while Kiper said he thinks
he will go late in the second. “Speed is his
greatest asset," Graves said. “Everyone’s
looking for a corner that can run.” Young
said, “He’s a good cover guy, adequate
support guy and can return punts.”

Panthers who may go in the later rounds
include offensive linemer1JeffChristy and
Scott Miller and tight ends Eric Seaman
and Dave Moore.

Milliron’s Mock Draft 1992

1. Indianapolis — Steve Emtman, DL,
Washington. GM Jim Irsay is wooing him
to play in Indy with pizza outings. Emtman
is a phenomenal combination of size,
speed, strength and quickness.

2. Indianapolis — Sean Gilbert, DL, Pitt.
Gilbert is meeting with lrsay today and is
one of the Colts’ four to five finalists for
their first two picks._ “You look at what
Reggie White and Jerome Brown do for
the Eagles and we can see Emtman and
Gilbert as Colts,” Irsay said.

3. Los Angeles Rams —— Quentin Coryatt,
LB, Texas A&M. The Rams should trade
down, but if they’don’t Coryatt is the best
defensive player available.

4. Cincinnati — David Klingler, QB,
Houston. Dallas will likely trade up here
for Troy Vincent, CB, Wisconsin. If not,
Klingler is the Bengals’ QB of the ’90s.

5. Green Bay— Desmond Howard,WR,
Michigan. The Pack needs flash and field
position;,Howard will give them both.

6. Washington — Troy Vincent, DB,
Wisconsin. Sixth pick is a luxury for the
‘Skins. Vincent would be the eventual heir
to Darrell Green’s job of covering the
MDR (Most Dangerous Receiver).

Pitt News File Photo

Former Pitt defensive end Keith Hamilton is projected as a second-round pick.

7. Miami — Terrell Buckley, CB, FSU.
The fish need “D” in a big way and must
take Buckley now so the Pats can't.

8. New England — Bob Whitfield, OL,
Stanford. Success of Pat Harlow makes the
Pats unafraid to take an OL this high.

9. Cleveland — Derek Brown, TE, Notre‘

Dame. Kosar misses Ozzie Newsome in
go—to situations. Brown can make the
third—down play.

10. Seattle — Vaughn Dunbar, RB,
Indiana. RBs always have the best chance
of making an immediate impact, and
Dunbar is a good one.

11. Pittsburgh— Leon Searcy, OL, Miami
(Fla). Searcy can play T or G. The Steelers
need the ability to move the pile, and
Searcy can do it.

12. Miami — Chuck Smith, OLB,
Tennessee. The Dolphins need DL, but
Shula loves Smith.

15. Dallas —— Chester McGlockton, DL,

Clemson. The Cowboys need DB3, but
340-pound McGlockton is too good to
pass up.

14. N.Y. Giants—Alonzo Spe1lman,DE,

Ohio State. The Giants are looking to put '

heat back on the passer.

15. N.Y. Jets —- Eugene Chung, OT, Va.
Tech. The Jets seek to maintain their
running game and improve pass protection.

16. L.A. Raiders — Carl Pickens, WR,
Tennessee. Al Davis knows speed kills
and that this guy is “a player.”

17. Atlanta — Tony Smith, RB, Southern
Mississippi. Unless WR Mike Pritchard is
traded for Denver RB Bobby Humphrey.

18. San Francisco —— Dale Carter, DB,
Tennessee. This would give the 49ers an
impact player in the secondary, which
they need.

19. Atlanta—— Billjohnson, DL, Michigan
State. The Falcons have to generate pass
rush without blitzing all the time.

 

20. Kansas City — Kevin Smith, CB,
Texas A&M. The Chiefs’ secondary is
getting older, and they are already strong
at DL and LB.

21. New Orleans — Darryl Williams,'.

DB, Miami (Fla.). Injuries and “Plan B”
plague the Saints’ secondary. Williams
may be the cure.

22. Chicago— Ray Roberts, OT, Virginia.’
Roberts would fulfill the Bears’ need due
to the retirement of Jimbo Covert.

23. San Diego — Chris Mims, DE,
Tennessee. With the trade of Lee Williams,
the Chargers could use a pass rusher.

24. Dallas —— Todd Collins, LB, Carson-
Newman. The Cowboys need an athletic
demon at MLB, and Collins has incredible
raw ability.

25. Denver — Robert Porcher, DL, S.C.
State. Porcher gets after the QB and will be
great playing in front of Mike Croel.

26. Detroit —— Johnny Mitchell, TE,
Nebraska. Mitchell looks like the perfect
HB for new Offensive Coordinator Dan
Henning’s scheme.

27. Buffalo —— Robert Harris, DL,
Southern. An impressive physical
specimen, Harris wowed NFL people
during practice week prior to the Senior
Bowl.

28. Washington — Eddie Blake, OG,
Auburn. At 6-3, 321 pounds, Blake is a
Hog if ever there was one.

Well, that’s my NFL Mock Draft for 1992.
Maybe it will be more accurate than my
NCAA predictions  maybe not. Be sure
to tune in to the draft after finals. It is sure
to be exciting and always controversial.
There are likely to be many big names
traded on draft day this year, names like
Herschel Walker, Steve Young, Charles

l-laley, Eric Dickerson and Bobby '

Humphrey.

important for both men and.

“I think. a lot of men feel

“I would encourage men to
step aside from that feeling and
be open to the fact that men as a

King’s latest Sleepwalkers should have stayed in bed

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

I normally don’t like to dabble
in these sort of “spiritual horror”
genre films, but I must admit the

-trailers caught my attention,

hinting at something
extraterrestrial and unreal yet
bizarre enough that the known
heroic ending wouldn't matter.
And it didn’t, thanks to the awful
plot and an awful lot of poor
acting that made not only the
ending corny but the whole thing
unexcusably pitiful.
Sleepwalleers is Stephen King’s
first screenplay for the big screen.
In past efforts, his novels and

, shorts have been rewritten and

recreated for the pictures,
sometimes allowing the text to
work, while at others drowning
his writing skills into hard-headed
Hollywood schlock. Pet
Semetary, Silver Bullet and
Firestarrercome to mind instantly
as ho~humming disasters, while
Carrie and the more detailed

textual depth of The Dead Zone
and The Shining accomplished
their goals of forcing shrills and
leaving audiences on the edge of
their cliched seats.

King is, of course, known for
his ability to produce fear in even
the bravest of souls, but in
Sleepwal/eers the only fear
acheived would be to sit through
this waste again. The story (and
that’s an insult to most writers)
centers around Charles and Mary
Brady, the vaguely portrayed
Sleepwalkers, who stay alive by
feeding off “virtuous young
women.” After finding a victim in
sunny California and killing a
multitude of cats, the Bradys move
to a small town in Indiana, where
the plot thickens but never boils.

Charles (Brian Krause) is the
lifeblood of the duo, using his
boyish looks to snatch up femmes,
and his Indiana belle of choice is
Tanya Robertson (the beautiful
Madchen Amick, who played
Shelly on “Twin Peaks”). Playing

Musical vignettes triumph in The Pit’s Working

By Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

Working, currently playing at
The Pit, is an eclectic celebration
of America’s work force — from
the president of the company to
the parking—lot attendant.

In a series of unrelated
vignettes, the musical tells the
story of American workers’ search
for self and identity against a
system which often renders them
nameless and faceless. Although
all workers, both white collar
and blue collar, are represented,
the service industries are given
the spotlight in this show.
U!/or/emgwas adapted from Studs
Terkel’s book by the same name,
and it features non-fictional
characters whose names — but
not words— have been changed.

The show features a versatile
cast of undergraduates, all of
whom succeed in several different
roles. Lynn Ann Bernatowicz, the
news girl, sings off—key with relish
and gives an energetic, endearing
performance. She_ plays a hippie
copy girl equally well in the
second act, creating two distinctly
different characters.

Wendy Gigler has impeccable
comic timing as the secretary,
who will try anything to avoid
working. Her facial expressions,
gestures and delivery are all
perfect as she subverts her boss
and files her nails. She later gives
a moving rendition of “Just a
Housewife,” blending humor and
frustration into one of the better
numbers in the show.

Equally funny is Robert J.
Masterson as the gas man.

Masterson plays the thrill—seeking

sings very well in “The Mason.”

Another moment to watch is
Garrin W. Dickinson’s tender

a teacher searching for new ways
to reach her students. Pugliano,
who helped choreograph the
production, performs and dances
well in several scenes.

Laying down Leppard

Def Leppard
Adrenalize
Mercury Records

Summer is the time for kicking
back and forgetting the trivial
problems in your life; be they

' relationships,'school, parents or
whatever. A common, time-
consuming endeavor is catching
both some rays and an earful of
roarin’ tunes. With this in mind,
choosing your audio kicks forthe
summertime becomes THE
responsibility in your life.

To meet the challenge of such
a task, take my advice: Look in
the mirror, long and hard, and
ask yourself, “Do ya wanna get

rocleed?”

If the answer is, “I think not!”
buy some U2, Morrissey or Cure
tapes, lock yourself in a
windowless room with a bottle of
whiskey and wallow in the mire
of reflective lyrics. There’s
summer fun for ya! (That’s
sarcasm.) But if your answer to

the $25,000 question is, “Hell,,

yeah! Rock my world, bud!” then

forget the meaning, forget the.

originality and head for the
romping antics of pop-metal
staple Def Leppard — which
returns after yet another extended
hiatus with the fuel-injected, 10-
track Adrenalize. Leave your
troubles behind ‘til September.

Having established itself in the
rock world in the '80s with classic
(albeit cheesy) rocket assaults
like “Bringing On the Heartbreak,”
“Photograph” and “Pour Some
Sugar On Me,” the now—four—
piece British Lep has perfected
the art of making bedfellows of
pop music and heavy metal. With
Adrenalize, it’s more of the

same—— only tighter, more
accessible and upbeat and just
plain better — an amazing

accomplishment when one
considers the hell these guys have
been through, including
amputation, addiction and death.

With last year’s alcohol-induced
death of lead guitarist, Steve Clark,
serving as the latest tragedy, it’s
nothing short of a miracle that

‘singer Joe Elliott, guitarist Phil

Collen, bassist Rick Savage and
drummer Rick Allen haven’t fallen
into the depth of depression and

lost their raucous, airy attitude’

about rock.

If any rock group has had any
justifiable reasons to transform
their melodramatic, real-life
experiences into politically
correct, critic-friendly music, it’s

Def Leppard. But save for one
track on the latest release
(“White Lightning”), this cagey
quartet has avoided such
obvious sources of inspiration,
choosing rather to focus its
efforts on mastering the raspy,
guitar-driven, Leppard sound
made famous in early albums
Higb ‘N’D2y and Pyromania.
As with the band’s 15—million

selling 1987 release, Hysteria,

the tone and focus of Adrenalize
leans heavy not on whether the
lyrics are meaningful or
prophetic but-on how the licks
and kicks sound.

A prime, mid-tempo giddyup
that personiﬁes the “sound not
lyrics” mentality of the Leps is
the Hysteria-like track, “Stand
Up (Kick Love Into Motion).”
Try to find something blazingly
fresh in the meaning of this
tune. You can’t. It’s a basic “I’m
lonely; you’re available but
apprehensive”-love ballad. But
the patented combination of
ElIiott’s sand—paper yelp with
Savage’s thumping bass riff and
Allen’s simple backbeat
produces four minutes of rocket

certifiable hit.

.Lange 7- is employed by new

producer Mike Shipley and the
boys throughout all 10 tracks.
Another slow—paced smash is the
somber, “Love Bites”-ish, fist-
pumper, “Have You Ever Needed
Someone So Bad,” which drips
with Elliott’s passionate, breathlike
whisper and Collin’s tough string-
tapping.

“Tonight,” a gallup first written
in 1984, regurgitates the passion
of “Have You Ever” and “Stand
Up” and gives the album a solid
base of love ballads to go with the
strength of the band’s power-rock
jaunts. '

In addition to the first single,
“Let’s Get Rocked” (a hurricane of
bouncy beats and ballsy chords
inspired by Bart Simpson, no less),
four other songs leap off the

speakers and grab you around
the throat, demanding to be
played repeatedly.

“Make Love Like A Man” is
typical Leppard groin rocker,
riding the wave of an upbeat
“Honky Tonk Woman”-like drum
pace to oblivion and back, placing
second in the sprint to the song’s
end to killer group vocals. It’s

simply the bestsong on the album.

Another roaring revival comes
alive in “Personal Property,” a
guitar adventure that features the
formidable abilities of double-
duty axe man Collin to the fullest.
Another reference to the Stones
pops up in the “Tear It Down”
(an ’88 b-side), when a lyric hook
from "lt’s Only Rock ‘n’ Roll”

makes a guestappearance. (“You
got the look I'm hammin' for/ I
like it!”)

Two other jabs at lava metal
make the cut: “Heaven Is” and “I
Wanna Touch You.”

This rounds out a work that —
top to bottom -—— is the band's
best yet.

The Leppards may never
present the music world with
ground—breaking meaning in their
tunes, but as long as they sustain
the earth—shaking energy they’ve
created in albums one through
five —— especially Adrenalize —
fans of slick, hard, rock music
will be more than satisfied.

Pussy Galore
Corpse Loz/e— The First Year
Caroline Records

Today, in 1992, when you think
of music in Washington D.C. —
clean, straight edged, non-
alcoholic and narcotic — fast-
tempo guitars that scream about
every imaginable social injustice
are heard loud and strong; lets
not forget the vegan diets too 
In 1985 yeah there was Minor
Threat, Government Issue and
all... but there was Pussy Galore
too; the proverbial one-percenters
who had there start there but
quickly saw what is plain to see
now and rolled to the more fertile
ground of the Alphabet City in

Manhattan in June of ’86. There,
along with Kim Gordon, Don
Flemming and others, they
spewed out noise and semiotic
destruction; sticking the business
end of an AK-47 in everything in
plain sight.

That all being said, this
posthumous release on Caroline
records, Corpse Love The First

Year, is a conglomeration of

outtakes, 4—Tracked practice
sessions, club dates at D.C. Space
and The Hung Jury Pub in D. C.,
The Bone Club in San Antonio
and (their first .two releases —
Exile On Main Street and Pussy
Gold 5000— 28 cuts in all, but
beware of the first 20, it’s a rough
go and might be a bit too abrasive

“Soundcheck,” “Dead Meat” and

“Car Fantasy” — a piece laden

Exife On Main St, “Ventilator
Blues,” and “Just Wanna See I-Iis
Face.” Each generation interprets
the one preceding fundamentally
differently, and these tracks
provide a working example.
The final portion of the disc is

, where the band begins to gell.

“Spin Out,” which previously

V appeared on Pussy Gold 5000, is

a high-velocity, multi-layered
pack of white noise, and topped
with Ha gerty’s psycho-billy guitar,
jackhammers its way through
granite, hurdling shards at you at
mock—3.

Since their own deconstruction »
you can see them play out in
different incarnations. Bob Bert
in Bewitched. Christina fronts for
Boss Hog. And Julia plays in
Action Swingers, and the self-
parodied band that reads like the

two—hour Kojak pilot — The
Velvet Monkeys. Jon Spencer
fronts his band the Blues
Experience. Each piece is worthy
of inspection, and a trip to the
Pyramid or CBGB’s.

Corpse Love isn’t made for the
novice, but what it does is provide
a broader context and an
understanding of how Pussy
Galore formulated its sound from
the barely audible track 3
“Constant Pain” to No. 28 “Get
Out” which clearly shows their
capabilities.

Pussy Galore, call them what
you want — sexist, racist, anti-
semitic  that’s the easy way.
instead of playing on soap boxes,
the idea simply was to pummel
anyone they could find — to bits

Local comedy sceneno joke

By Tonya Hurley
Sla_[fWr1'ler

Movies aren’t the only things
bringing attention to Pittsburgh.
Recently the comedy scene has
exploded, thanks to the national
rise of local, young talents like
Dennis Miller, formerly of
“Saturday Night Live,” and Mario
Joyner of MTV. While the people
of Pittsburgh are laughing at
comedians in clubs like The
Funny Bone in Station Square,
the ownersare laughing all the
way to the bank.

The Funny Bone is open six
nights a week, and the club is
usually packed every night with
people calling in frantically at the
last minute to make a reservation.

The club brings a lot of big names _

to the city, like Phyillis Diller,
Robert Klein,,Tommy Chong,
several acts from ‘.‘Late Night with
David Letterman” and “The
Tonight Show” and Jay Johnson,
the wacky ventriloquist from the

now—syndicated TV series “Soap.” .

‘‘I don’t do many comedy clubs.
In fact, this is the only club I’m
doing outside of Los Angeles this
year,” Johnson said backstage at
The Funny Bone. ‘

Johnson made several jokes
about The Funny Bone: “Here
we are at the world famous  “
He paused as if he was at a loss,
then turned around to read the
sign behind him and said, "Funny

Bone.” HoweverJohnson said he V

enjoys Pittsburgh a great deal
and said the audiences here are
great to perform for. Johnson
recently did six shows at the club
and is heading straight back to

Los Angeles, where he lives.‘

“Pittsburgh is a great city,” he
said.
Johnson played alongside some

-very talented cast members on

“Soap,” including Billy Crystal,
who has performed in the past at
The Funny Bone. Johnson played
Chuck, a looney ventriloquist,
along with his puppet, Bob.
Johnson said ventriloquism is
an art form and one that should

he took the stage with Bob, the
last thing on anyone’s mind was
respect.

“What is the difference between I

a pig and a‘ fox?” Bob asked.
“What?” Johnson asked. “Four
drinks,” replied Bob.

Then Bob spotted a girl in the
audience, and of course he had a
comment.

“She is loving me. She thinks

I’m a stud. She wants my two-by-
four wood pecker,” Bob said.
Johnson looked at him, seeming
embarrassed that he had blurted
out such a thing.

Obviously, Bob gets Johnson
into a lot of trouble even when he
is offstage. Johnson was on the
road, and he was- staying at a
hotel in a two-room suite. He
often sketches while travelling,
and he was working on a cartoon
of a man at a table. Well, Bob just
happened to be the perfect model,
so Johnson propped him up in
the living—room area. Johnson
finished his sketch and locked
the bedroom side of the suite
where he retired for the evening;

Bob was on. In the rnorning,
Johnson was awakened by a
knock at the door.
“Housekeeping,” a voice said.
Johnson said, “I didn’t have
enough clothes on to come out,
so I just stood back and said,
‘Can you come back later because
I’m busy?’ I heard a loud scream,
so I walked out and realized I
had left Bob where I was
sketching him and all the maid
saw was a puppet sitting on the
table, saying, ‘Come back later.
I’m busy,’ So I have this reputation
of being a little spooky on the
road as a guy who keeps his
puppets out,” Johnson said as he
burst into laughter.

Johnson said he views his
puppets as a musician would an
instrument. He is regarded as a
favorite at The Funny Bone and
plans on coming back when he
gets a chance.

The Funny Bone is the only
full—time comedy club in
Pittsburgh, but there are several
bars that hold open stages and

comedy nights, one being Graffiti
in Oakland.

Graffiti gives young talent an
opportunity to show what they’ve
got, and Vince Horvath does just
that. Vince is from Uniontown,
and he moved to Pittsburgh four
years ago.

“I came here because I didn't
know who to launch my career
and a friend of mine showed me
an open stage at Graffiti,” he said.

“Pittsburgh is a good place to
learn about comedy,” he said. He
said it is a small enough town to
be able to grasp the humor that is
being presented.

The Graffiti really packs in the
people when it features
comedians such as Horvath. The
audience especially responded
to his old neighborhood man
impression. Horvath dressed up
in Poindexter glasses and a
Hou ndstooth jacket that he picked
up at a thrift store. He picked up
a baseball that has been
accidentally tossed into his yard
by a youngster next door. Horvath
shouts obscenities and portrays

the stereotype of an old neighbor
who really doesn’t know how to
deal with children and doesn’t
want to.

Some other crowd pleasers are
when Horvath says he uses the
automatic, adjustable seat in his
car as a trash compactor and
explains how he wants to take
his driver’s license picture with a
cigarette and a beer because that
is what he looks like when he
gets pulled over.

“There are a lot of talents that
start out here and make it back
periodically, like your Dennis
Millers,” he said. Vince Horvath
is certainly a talent in this city.
“I’m comfortable here right now,”
he said. And that is lucky for
Pittsburgh.

You don’t have to be as famous
as Jay Johnson to get noticed
here. Local talents are bursting
on to this rapidly growing
industry. There is one thing these
two talents have in common other
than performing in Pittsburgh.
They are funny, and that is all the
Pittsburgh audiences care about.

Mejor Dia Vendr'a,’.’ while Donovan tells their story with graceful
force. In a complete reversal, they are hilariously earthy as the _
truckers in Act II, yet another pair of chameleons in this show:

In “It’s an Art,” Rae Thomas gives an amusing send-up of
waitressing. Thomas excels in this number, taking a wry look at
both herself and her customers. Shannon Kennedy plays several
characters very well and gives a moving tribute to the worker '
with her Song, “Millwork.”

Each member of the cast had a chance to shine in this
production. Jon Erik Sch reiber has a strong tenor voice, showcased
in the number “Fathers and Sons.” Ted Worsley gives a humanistic
portrayal of the firefighter. Rudyard R. Chichlow is a blues-
singing parking attendant, and Brett Weisberger goes overboard
as a young executive.

The construction worker is played with a grin by Robert
McLovich. McI.ovich conveys the joys and sorrows of all
American workers within his monologues. His big eyes seem to

simply radiate sincerity as he sings in the roof-raising finale, ‘

“Something to Point To.”

The musical ensemble features Karen Dever, Vlad Rosco and
Donovan. All three play extremely well — particularly Rosco on
the show’s lyrical guitar numbers. Unfortunately, they sometimes
overpower the soloists. '

Sleep  

Continued from page S-2
on small—town mentality and the
“new in town/no friends”
sympathy rap, it isn’t long before
Charles lands a date with vixen
Tanya. A picnic at the cemetery is
the scene of the date that turns
ugly. After a kiss, Charles
transforms into a sleepwalker,
trying to literally suck the life out
of Tonya, whose not having it.
Stunned yet witful, she smashes
her camera off his face and
everything falls apart, most
notably the script. In what has to
be one ofthe silliest scenes ofthe
year, sleepwalker Charles turns
into a bad comic, spewing out
idiotic lines like, “Why don’t you
just consider yourselflunch,” and
“Just look at this shirt. My mother
is gonna kill me” after it’s covered
with his blood, courtesy of
T onya’s camera.

The scene is so bad it isn’t even
campy or B-horror status. Instead
of laughing at (or with) the script’s
lunacy, the scene is humiliating
to watch. Charles’ lines and acting
are so bad that it’s hard to imagine
this getting by the Columbia
Picture reps who judge the films.
Tanya manages to escape and
runs into a cop, who had earlier
pursued Charles in the f ilm’s token

car chase. The debacle continues
as the cop ﬁres a strike to the gut
of Charles that does nothing
except extract the line: “I don’t
believe you fired a warning shot,
Officer.” If this wasn’t hollow
enough, the only thing capable
of stopping Charles is the now-
dead cop’s cat, Clovis, who senses
he is something unexplainable
and jumps on his head, causing
much damage. Charles is forced
to flee to the homefront, where
Mary (Alice Krige, who played
the sexy, rich publisher in Barﬂy)
is waiting patiently for something
to eat, namely Tanya’s life.

No such. luck. Mary gets nasty
as her son is in an awful way and
she’s starving and wants Tanya,
who’s at home in police custody.
But the police are no match for
this unexplained thing (Mary).
She takes out a dozen or so cops
and drags Tanya to the
homestead, which is surrounded
by hundreds of cats. The ending
is pure predictability, with Tanya
and Clovis trading off as hero and
heroine and the Sleepwalkers
destroyed. Great cultural
schematics at work with the good
girl beating the bad, but this one
deserves no applause — just
sympathy.

A meeting with the enemy: Madehen Amicksmiles at the sleepwalkers.

The real problem with the film
is the script and the way director
Mick Garris brings the script to
life, or in this case fails to. (Garris
is the one who ruined the Psycho
series with the made—for—cable
Psyc/70 4, destroyed Cronen-
berg’s The Fly with the
horrendous sequel and directed
the thrilling Critters 2.) The
Sleepwalkers are never defined
in the film, and you’re not sure
what type of needs they have or
what they are all about. Are they
vampires; are they some offshoot
of cats; what? They are jjncestu al:
dancing, kissing, making love and

showing deep affection for each
other as ifthey were the only two
freaks alive. Are they? The film
briefly hints at it as Mary says, “I
know there are others; I can feel
them.”

Passing their traits off as
unnecessary, only worth a quick
pinch of dialogue, destroys the
films credibility. If we’re supposed
to feel for the Sleepwalkers,
there's no chance, thanks to the
lack of depth they have. Thus,
we must assume that the duo are
ultimately “bad,” and on that level
the film doesn’t work either
because of its outrageous

unappeal to reality and its
ridiculous filmmaking. If they’re
just “bad,” then the film becomes
superficial and can be viewed on
a good/bad level. The acting
(particularly Charles) and action
make it the latter— not to mention
the fact that there isn’t a moment
of fear throughout the flick.

In ascribing a letter grade to
this embarrassment (for me to be
seen in the theater), which is
never a good critical trait, I’d say
this one walked the dog, as in a
big, fat D. Save your dollars; with
a cat as the hero, this film could
have been a'Disney feature.
