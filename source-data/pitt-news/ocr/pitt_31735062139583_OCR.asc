CPSF Considers
Rush,I-F Council
Reports Tonight

Rough Draft Of Constitution For
New Interfraternity Council
May Be Ready

New Rushing Code Up

The Council of Presidents of Social
Fraternities meets tonight—its first
meeting since the group approved
recommendations to institute a new
Interfraternity Council on this campus.

That tonight’s meeting will provide
deﬁnite procedure for establishing
such a council appears to be doubtful.
A committee under the chairmanship
of James VVills, C35, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, by Monday had been unable
to function, but was expected to meet

yesterday afternoon and draw up a
sample constitution for the proposed
body. Leslie Wilkins, C35, Delta Tau
Delta, and CPSF chairman, and N.
Robert Seidle, assistant to the dean
of men and CPSF adviser, were to as-
sist the committee. On Wills’ com-
mittee are’ Louis Snider1nan_ BA35,
Pi Lambda Phi, and Clifton M,cLain,
C35, Sigma Chi.

CPSF will not be able to establish
an I-F Council until a suitable con-
stitution is drawn up, approved by
that body, and approved again by the
fraternity advisory committee. Then
such a council can become a reality.
There has not been an I-F Council
here since last May, when recognition
was withdrawn by the University be-
cause of political strife within the or-
ganization over the election of officers.
CPSF was organized by the oﬂice of
the dean of men as a temporary body
to serve for this year at least, or until
it was deemed practical to organize
another Interfraternity Council. At
its last meeting, CPSF members con-
sidered the time now propitious for
such a change.

Henry George, M35, Pi Kappa
Alpha, chairman of a committee to re-
vise the rushing procedure for next
year. is expected to give the report
of his committee tonight. It was
learned by The News that among the
recommendations was the suggestion
to move rushing season closer to the
beginning of the semester “to help
freshmen feel at home at Pitt and to
get acquainted more easily.” How-
ever, it will be urged that all invita-
tions to rushing affairs in the- begin-
ning of the season be registered
through the oﬂice of the dean of men
to eliminate “super-rushing."

It is understood that the rules will
call for sane rushing and will curb
the number of affairs each fraternity
may sponsor during the earlier—but
protracted—rush season.

At 6 o'clock tonight CP»S\F’s 13 mem-
bers, with Mr. Seidle, will sit down to
dinner at the Phi Epsilon Pi house.

D r u i d Petitions Ready
For Off- Year Sophomores

Only one ﬁrst semester sophomore
had taken out a petition for Druids,
national honorary sophomore activi-
ties fraternity, Monday, when peti-
tions were ﬁrst made available in the
oﬂlce of the dean of men. Room 801,
Cathedral.

mores are eligible.

Elections are scheduled for Febru-
ary 26, at which time at least. two

Pitt May Soon
Be Broadcasting
From Cathedral

“This is the University of Pitts-
burgh short-wave station transmitting
from the top floors of Pitt's 40 -story
Cathedral of Learning.” ,

\Vell, not yet, it's true; but there’s
a chance that the above my be
ﬂashed over air waves shortly.

The University had a short-wave
transmitting set about a year ago and
made -.1 number of experimental broad-
casts from the top floor ‘of-‘the Cathe-
dral. But the longest range obtained
was about fifty miles and the project
was not considered too successful.

Charles C. Miller, EE38, a member
of the American Radio Relay league,
and builder a.11d operator of a 130-
watt station at his home in Frank-
lin, has been investigating the pos-
sibilities of establishing a University
station which should be capable of
extending a range of about 250 miles.
P. E. Rush, assistant professor of
electrical engineering, and G. A. ‘Scott,
assistant professor of physics, are co-
operating with Miller, and have de-
cided on the formation of an under-
graduate radio club to make the plan
feasible.

All students who are licensed am-
ateurs, or are avid experimentersor
set builders, have been invited by Mr.
Rush, Mr. Scott and Miller to register
in the electrical engineering depart-
ment ofﬁce in Thaw hall if they care
to join such a club.

The transmitter used last year was
of ﬁve watts; the contemplated one
for radio club usage will probably be
of 45 watts, Miller said.

On his own set, Miller has com-
municated with fourteen countries.

16 EnteringMen
May Pledge Soon

crsr Poll Shows 37 Freshmen
Willing To oin Fraternities

 

Of a class of approximately 55 men,
only 16 ﬁrst semester freshmen have
signiﬁed intention of pledging a so-
cial fraternity this year.

A questionnaire, distributed by the
CP-SF to all incoming men during
freshman week this month, asking for
answersto the questions: “Do you
intend to pledge a fraternity some
time during your college career?"
and “Do you intend to pledge during
your freshman year?” Included in
each question was the condition, “if

‘you are afforded-the opportunity.”

The results tabulated by The News
show that 37 men intend joining fra-
ternities before they graduate; 16
will join their freshman year; 22 will

-not join this year; and only four are

determined to remain non-fraternity
men. Among the 55 were some who
were undecided, or who had to con-
sult their parents before they could
reach a decision. -

Meanwhile, plans for fraternity
rushing this semester call for the
opening of the season next Wednes-
day morning at 8:30 o'clock. The

period Will extend until 2 o'clock the _ '

following‘ Sunday ‘morning. ‘

Rushing season this semester will
be the shortest in modern history.
Last yearat this time, second semes-
ter rushing extended from a Monday
morning to the following Sunday.
The curtailment of the period is
mainly an economy measure on the
part of the individual fraternities, ac-
cording to N.’ Robert Seidle, assist-
ant. dean of men.

New Faculty Member Will

Howard J. Stephens, newest faculty
appointee in the department of indus-
trial engineering, will speak  a com-
bined industrial a.nd civil engineering
meeting tomorrow morning at 11:30
o’clock.

The new assistant instructor re-
ceived his degree from the depart-
ment of industrial engineering at the
University in 1931. After graduation
he was appointed on a commission in-
vestigating the smoke peril in Pitts-
burgh. Mr. Stephens took up CCC

Cap, Gown Leads
In Men’s Interest

63.5 Per Cent of Men Participate
. In University Activities

 

Of a total of 2.517 undergraduate
men on campus, 63.5 per cent are or
have been in some University activity
during the past year, N. ‘Robert Seidle,
assistant to the dean of men, an-
nounced yesterday.

Only 35.6 per cent of this total,
however, have a point scale -rating in
the dean of men's office. This differ-
ence between the number active and
the number receiving points is ac-
counted for by the scaling system
which, for example, does not give a
fraternity man points, but applies to
fra.ternity officers.

Cap and Gown, with 138 men ac-
tive, was the most popular activity, It
was followed in enrollment by the
University band, in which 124 men
take part.

The Glee club and varsity football
team tie for third place with 70 men
each, followed by Pitt Riﬂes with 59.

The 'Pitt.News, with 57 men on the
staff. takes sixth place. The Owl,
with 46, and the Panther with 40. are
close behind. Pitt Players includes
44, and the cross-country team num-
bers 48.

Grouped together
mark are varsity boxing, orchestra,
swimming, debating, wrestling, the
YMCA Cabinet, and SFA. Major
dance committees averaged 20 to 25
men. Varsity basketball, freshman
‘boxing, and the Quill club end the list
with less than'20 and more than 16
male members. "

The Trailing Purple
Picked Up Plenty

Conflicting engagements have
forced the Classical club to post-
pone its intended Fashion Show
to next semester. Warned by a
Pitt News reporter of the danger
of postponing an event of this
nature, Estella Durkalska, C37,

' president of the club, stated that
she has deﬁnite and positive in-
formation that there will be no
essential change in the designs of
the modish toga. stolla, palla, or
paludamentum this winter.

“The well-dressed Roman,"
avers Miss Dur,ka‘-lska, “was- so
much less ﬁckle about style than
even conservative modern dress-
ers that in the Forum it was con-
sidered an advantage that a gar-
ment could be worn by several
generations without becoming out-
moded."

Holbrook -Submits Paper
Scoring TVA Projects

The National Coal Association has
just published, in pamphlet form, a
paper by E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
School of Engineering, on the Ten-
nessee Valley electric power project.

The paper, which asserts that “the
people of the whole country will pay
for the Tennessee Valley Authority
project at a total cost. greater than
the cost of coal-generated power,” was
originally presented to the electrical
engineering seminar. ,

The proposed St. Lawrence river
project is described as a threat to
Pennsylvania industry, by which 100,-
000 miners would be left without
means of subsistence, 48 per cent of
the trafﬁc of the Pennsylvania rail-
road would be lost, and whole coun-
ties would ultimately be left without
population or taxable property.

   

 

Heart ‘Hop Clears
$ IOO Profit

University women have carried
out their threats, and have shown
the men how to make money on
a dance. The estimated returns
from the Heart Hop, the all-Uni-
versity women's dance, show
probable proﬁt of over $100.

If this amount proves to be cor-
rect, the four classes will have
put over the biggest ﬁnancial suc-
cess of-any; affair- sponsored by a
University organization this year.

No complete report is possible
as yet. Ticket returns have not
yet been made, a.nd all bills have
not been turned in and paid. The
estimate is based on the attend-
ance at the dance, the probable
number of complimentary tickets,
and the known expenses.

When complete returns are re-
ported, the proﬁt will be appor-
tioned to the classes in accordance
with the number of tickets sold by
the representatives of each class.

Schoen Addresses
Psychology Forum

Skill In One Field No» Indication
Of Intelligence, Group Hears

Great skill or specialization in any
one ﬁeld is no criterion of intelli-
gence, according to Dr. Max Schoen,
head of the psychology department
at Catrnegie Tech, speaking at the
ﬁrst meeting of the psychology forum
on Monday. “A man. with the scien-
tiﬁc abilities of an Einstein,” he said,
“can be so dogmatic in the ﬁelds of
economics or sociology because of
-'pr‘e‘judi—ee as to‘ preclude any possibili-
ty of ‘an intelligent classiﬁcation.”

“‘Intelligence’ has been a much.
abused word,” said Dr. Schoen, “and
I have arrived at my concept through
attempts to give my students a
deﬁnition of intelligence without hav-
ing to blush for it.”

“Intelligence. is a habit of fore-
thought,” continued Dr. Schoen, “to-
wards the better adaptability of the
individual to his enviroiinient. It is
the ability to manipulate material
or information in a socially satisfying
manner. The intelligent individual is
the person who has learned habits of
seeking and searching its meaning in
material form.”

"All normal human beings can be
made intelligent,” thinks Dr. Schoen,
“because all intelligence is the result
of acquisition; it is the result of pro-
per education. The idea of intelli-
gence. of course presupposes a normal
learning ability —— an imbecile must
remain an imbecile despite the most
intelligent and thoroughgoing train-
mg.

“A great amount of information
and a great ability to learn do not
determine in themselves the amount
of intelligence, but these are factors
which can indicate a great potential
of intelligence. Information is only
the raw material out of which intelli-
gent or controlled behavior or action
can be built. In a sense intelligence
has an element of creativeness,” he
added.

 

Engineering Foundation

Grants Research Funds ‘

Funds have been granted by the
Engineering Foundation of New York
to aid the engineering research now
being carried out by Dr. A. Nadai,
Research Professor of Mechanical En-
gineering, according to an announce-
ment by E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
School .of- Engineering. «

Dr. Nada.i’s investigations concern
the plasticity or ﬂow of metals at
high temperatures. For the work
now being undertaken, the Westing-
house Electric and Manufacturing
company has made available to Dr.
Nadai the special facilities and appar-
atus of its laboratories. Vvith the
funds granted by the Engineering
Foundation, investigations will be un-
dertaken on plasticity of metals of
special application in the design of
boilers and stills operating at high
temperatures.

Billions For Defense

RMY proposals to the House
Military Affairs Committee
show that President Roosevelt.’s
projected expenditures for na-
tional defense have passed the
billion-dollar mark to provide for
an unprecedented peacetime ex-
pansion in the land, sea and air
service.

In the plan to push America’s
first line of defense 2,000 miles
into the Paciﬁc, an $11,000,000 air
base for Hawaii was recommend-
ed to the House Appropriations
Coiniliittee by the Military Affairs
Committee. This “world’s larg-
est air base,” as termed in Japan,
would be only one of a. chain be-
ginning in Alaska and ending in
the Panama Canal Zone.

The strengthening of military
outposts, in turn, would fit into a
$405,000,000 Army modernization
program involving Army person-
nel expansion by at least one-
third and a. mass increase in air-
craft by 2,320 planes. Congres-
sional leaders said that while the
entire program would constitute
the largest peace—t.ime national
defense program and might take
ﬁrst. rank in size among current
world expenditures, the move was
strictly “defensive” and a source
of large employment.

Students will be interested in
still other implications of the
measure:

In spite of our agreement to
‘liberate the Philippines, the Unit-
ed States is not to renounce the
Far East as a ﬁeld of economic
activity.

On the contrary, the defense
measure, along with the supple-
n'1ent.ary bill to give the United
States “a merchant-marine sec-
ond to none,” means that we shall

‘be competing with Japan for the
diminishing prestige

of Great
Britain and for the increasing
markets of China and I11dia in

the East,

Luied by Japan’s 200 percent

“expansion of foreign trade dur-
[ing the years of the depression,

when other trading countries
were suffering loss of more than
half their business, the United
States will openly cooperate with
Great Britain in snatching chest-
nuts from the Imperial bonﬁre.
The pursuit of overseas mar-
kets, which intensiﬁed the hostili-
ties of the world in 1914, is to be
made again—this time in an area
where American interests will be
very quickly aﬁected. .
The danger signals are ﬂyinv.

More HOLG rum?

ILLS to increase resources of
the Home Owners Loan Cor-
poration by $1,500,000,000 have
been introduced in the House and
Senate by the banking committee
chairmen, and campus fraternity
chapters might lend an ear..

The original limit of $3,000,-
000,000, said to be exhausted,
served to rehabilitate chapter
houses in various states.
fornia colleges, approximately 30'

.frai:ernities made use of Federal

government loans to ﬁx dribbling
plumbing systems, to install im-
proved heating plants, or to make
other concessions to health and
comfort.

Now there is likely to be $1,-
500,000,000 more.

R.-l+2iCE'NT victories of the English
‘Labor party in by-elections have caused
great interest in the probable plat-
form of that party in the general
election expected in 1936. Now comes
Herbert Morrison, chairman of the
London City Council and most influ-
ential of Labor politicians today, to
say it will be best “to put the major
emphasis on the socialization of in-
dustry,” and to hope that the issue
at future British elections will be “a
frank one of socialism versus capl-
talism.”

McNair largely has failed to

Not so long ago, it was Mayor
Kline who had the political op-

zens and the public-spirited press

rugs and supply lists and appoint-
ments became table-talk at every

ner table.

Mayor Herron, who succeeded
Kline, belonged to the same
grand old party, and the taint of
g o v e 1' 11 m c 11 t a. l extravagance
checked his career in the depress-
ion election of 1932.

The present mayor is cliarged
with buffoonery, with being an
economic illiterate, with wanting
to run for Governor, with want-
ing to run for President, and with
furlouglling plumbing inspectors.

Nobody has ever charged him
with being a knave or with wast-
ing the people’s money.

He has shut down the more
obvious rackets, saved money for
taxpayers and injected some ex-
ceedingly lucid intervals into the
conduct of police courts.

He should be elected for a sec-

THE Duquesne ,

night, where the gates were
closed half an hour before game
time because of the crowd, and
where a large number of Uni-

away, is a good example of why
the Athletic Council should re-
store the ticket.-exchange plan.

There may be reasons why the
exchange plan is not feasible, but
they do not come to-mind. It. is
hard to understand why the plan
was ever abandoned; as far as
students were concerned it
worked well enough in 1931 and
1932.

If games are scheduled which

It is a recognition of this fact that,

The task of the teacher is to pre-
pare minds—be they in the primary

education, because they select and su-
pervise the preparation of teachers,
are fact.ors of greatest importance in
accomplishing these results.

It was very pleasant» to meet the

tors a little more democratic, a little
more human and pleasant.

And say, when Russ Connolly and
Lester Horn got together in the inter-
mission, it looked as if somebody was
advertising. But it was swellegant
advertising. Especially for the Prom.

And the ‘idea of‘ advertising the
prom, particularly on the pass out
checks, was clever but uncomfortable".
All in all, the whole affair was lovely.
I haveibeen wondering who paid the
various breakfast, checks.

The junior prom committee is cer-

Advertising has appeared everywhere,
and it is the proper sort, I believe, for
it has no smack of the cheapness so
often attached to campus advertise-

least, substantial and interesting. _

The staff of the Journeyman is

Former Pitt Student Explains One
Of Winchell’s Slips, Lauds Dr. Dafoe

by e. pickering

The following epistle came for this
column Friday as a result of the arti-
cle on the Pitt grad who was named
in VVinchell’s column as being the
Carnegie Hero Fund agent who was
in the Dionne’s part of Canada at the
time of the arrival of the quintuplets.
‘\Vincl1cl1 went on to say that this in-
vestlgator was supposed to be an
active newspapcrman, although he
passed up the biggest story of the
year. In reply we received this letter
which we give you verbatim:

February 5, 1935

Dear Pick:

Tsk! Tsk! I am surprised no
end at youand ‘Walter Winchell!
(get that, me and Winchell).
You and I will both agree that a
‘good’ newspaper man makes his

story accurate. So what? Just
this!
It seems that several days back,

Vvincliell mentioned a Carnegie Hero

9 Fund representative who had a chance

to scoop the world last summer on
the story of the quintuplets’ birth up
there in the Canadian wilds, but didn't
because he had forgotten that he had
once wanted to be a ‘good’ newspaper-
man. You and apparently three score
others on the Pitt campus have iden-
titled that scallion receiver as this
fellow who used to sleep with you in
the same classes. Remember? So,
hereby permit me to enact a Reilly
and enter a, plea for the defense, even
though we may have to substitute an
accurate story for one that was per-
haps more interesting. After all, I
want to be able to walk into a city
room again without hiding behind my
coat collar.

You see, the miracle and I
missed connections by six days.
When I trundled into that Cana-
dian crossroads, the place was so
dense with flea show promoters,
baby foodlspecialists, and Cas-
toria salesmen, that if it hadn’t
been for the dust they kicked up,
it.would have looked like Fifth »
and Smithfield the Saturday be-
fore Christmas. And enough ace
news-hawks had swooped down on
the hamlet, almost before the
sound of the-.stork’s wing flapping
had ceased, to give the place the
appearance of the city room of
the Sun-Tele on election night
with a four alarm fire burning up
the Koppers building at the same

time. There was every chance to
scoop the world . . if you don‘t
count the AP, UP, INS, a Mr.

John Richards of the New York
Times, a Mr. Carl Liscomb of the
Chicago Tribune, and a couple of
Mr. Hearst’s best newsreelers!
But I certainly endorse all that
Winchell says about the Doc. He is
a mighty good fellow. In the course
of my work up there, I had to see him
to get some technical dope on an ac-
cident. His opinion meant a lot to
the prospective hero, but there was
nothing in it for himself. He had" ﬁve
squawling, squirming mites on his
hands and a hungry‘ pack of photo-
getters 0n'his front porch, but that
didn’t make any difference to Doc.
He took enough time out to give me
all the information needed. A And
although he had driven 30 miles over
wash-board roads to look after a fel-
low who had been hurt in the acci-
dent, the Doc had forgotten to send
him a bill. He said, “When'you’re
helping a fellow who is hurt, you
can’t think about cash,” and t.hat,
don't you think, Pick, deserves one

of Mr.
orchids?

VVinchel1's most luscious

As ever,

P. S.—Of course this is confi-
dential, but if you can ﬁnd use for
any of it, please clothe it with
this anonymity you used the first
time. It’s tough to be ﬁred in
mid-winter.

OK, R, we hope that VV. VV. notes
this by some freak of chance and
helps to straighten out his scallion
t0SSi11g- HOWGVGI‘, we don’t think the
Doc would have any use for an orchid
up there in the backwoods, how about
making it a worm sweater?

Trackmen Train
To Break Marks
In indoor Games

Olsonmen Bring Away Plenty
Of Medals From Carnival
Held By Mountaineers

By Harry E. Robinson

Three years ago when Carl
Olson took up l1is duties  track
coach at tile Universit.y, he saw
the possibilities of stimulating’ in-
terest in track by holding invita-
tion meets for university students
who had the desire to participate
in such contests. The indoor track
and ﬁeld meet was the ﬁrst innova-
tion tried, and so successful was the
first one, that this sports carnival has
since occupied one of the choice spots
on Pitt’s winter sports’ card.

On Saturday afternoon the third an-
nual indoor track and ﬁeld meet will
be held, and if that old adage “the
third time’s a charm" comes true, this
coming event promises to be the big-
gest and best of all the indoor open
meets held thus far.

Since the indoor championships
started, only two marks on the rec-
ord board have remained untouched,
those being the two-mile run held by
Gus Moore, and the high jump, held
by Bill Robusch. The other twelve
marks on the board have been set
up within the last two years. ‘

However, all the indications
served out by the trackmen’s perform-
ances last week'in the West Virginia
relays point to another assault on
the records which grace a larger
portion of the side wall in the field
house.

In the freshman events, there should
be plenty of ﬁreworks with a strong
ﬁeld competing in practically every
event. Coffee and Thomas in the
sprints, Brown in the hurdles, Bennett

_in the high jump, Turchilt and Theri-

null: in the mile and half-mile. should
give the freshman marks a good run
for their money.

Novices stand Chance

Despite the fact that it would seem
as though this meet was just made
especially for track team members.
there’s a great opportunity for some
darkhorse, unknown to Coach Olson
at this time, to create a nice upset by
knocking off one of the favorites.

The meet is especially for these
clarkhorses who have never darkened
the track house door. By signing one
of the entry blanks, by getting an
athletic information card, by passing
the physical exam, and by showing
flying feet on Saturday afternoon
rt the track house, the unknown quan-
tities may carve a nice niche on track
record books and also make Olson
very happy.

Score High at Morgantown

Mingling with the cream of the
crop from the Middle Atlantic states’
colleges and universities didn’t seem
to make any difference to Coach Carl
Olson’s Panther track team-at the
‘Nest Virginia indoor track and ﬁeld
meet at Morgantown, West Virginia,
last Saturday afternoon and evening.

The Blue and Gold representatives
captured the majority of honors in
varsity, freshman, and AAU competi-
tion, bringing back to the Smoky City
two new meet records, a tie for a
world's record in another, and plenty‘
of ﬁrsts, seconds, and thirds in the
other events.

The outstanding contributor to the
list of new marks from Pitt was Sol
lvlenaker, who tied the world record
for the 60-meter sprint in the AAU
event for that distance by turning in

, the brilliant time of 6.8 seconds.

His performance was all the more
remarkabie for in the ﬁrst heat of the
70-yard dash for colleges, he crashed
into the cement wall at the end of
the straightaway, putting a deep gash
in his chin and spraining his wrist.
He went on, however, to take a second
in the ﬁnals of this event being nosed
out by Widmyer, Maryland star, to
win the AAU event; and to run the
one-lap part of Pitt's winning one-mile
medley combination which set a new
meet record.

Beside the mile medley mark and
I\Ienaker’s equalling of the 60-meter
record held at the present time by
Percy Williams, Canadian sprint star,
the other meet record set by a Panth-
er went to Irvin Brown. Pitt fresh-
man, who set a new mark of 8.4 sec-
onds in the freshman .70-yard low
hurdles.

Relayers Win Again

Pitt’s crack relay team of Kiger,
Connelly, McDonald, and Groat kept
up its winning ways by taking ﬁrst
honors in the four-ﬁfths mile relay
event. Their time "was 2 minutes,
4.6 seconds.

Bonavita won the 16-pound shot put
event with a throw of 45 feet, 2 inches.

Kirkpatrick, Musico; Tost and Al-
bright, the latter two tied for third
place, crossed the ﬁnish line in the
order mentioned to give Pitt 3. clean
sweep in the AAU 1.000-meter race.
Cy Pelucha vaulted 12 feet, 6 inches
to give Pitt a first in that event.
Johnson, another Panther, tied for
second. Ken Wagenhotiser led the
ﬁeld in the mile run for nine laps but
 last lap sprint by Harvey, Penn
State star, beat out Kenny.

Two freshmen, Thomas and Ben-
nett, won their events. Thomas took
the 70-yard dash, and Bennett jumped
highest in the high jump.

Varsity Wrestlers Meet
Yellow Jackets Saturday

The Panther wrestlers will make
their third start of the season Satur-

The varsity team has done every-
thing except win in the two past
meets, tieing with Wasliington and
Jefferson and losing to Vvest Virginia.

Coach Oster believes that the com»
petitive experience that his squad has
gained in the opening matches will
make it a. much harder team for the
Waynesburg squad.

day promises another hard test for
the Panthers, since Coach George
Keogan and his band of Irelanders
will be out to avenge the 26-22 licking
Pitt handed them when they were in
Pittsburgh last January.

Keogan has had his cagers going
at a great clip since the Panthers last
faced them, sweeping through most
of the mid-western teams that have
met the Irish. Illinois has been one
of the few teams to down the Ramb-
lers lately, nosing out the Notre
Dame outﬁt last week by one point.
Last Saturday, however, the Irish re-
turned to their winning ways by
whipping Northwestern, one of the
four teams to down Pitt this season,
by a. score of 28-26.

As a result of the Panthers’ thrill-
ing win over the Dukes last Friday,
which the local sport world is still,
gasping over, the Pitt cagers tied the.’
city title race into a knot tighter than
a habitual drunk. Both the Panthers
and Dukes show two wins and one
defeat on the city standing at the
present time,,and unless Carnegie
Tech bumps one of these two teams
later on the city title will, for the sec-
ond consecutive year, be shared by
Pitt and Duquesne. ,

Also, over the week-end, the Pan-'
ther cagers again assumed undis-
puted top honors in the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Conference as a result
of Temple decisively whipping the
West Virginia, conference leaders,
40-26. The defeat sent West Virginia
into a second-place tie with Temple
with three games won and two lost,
while the Panthers automatically
moved to the top with two won and
one lost. Three conference games re-
main on the Pitt schedule, the Pan-
thers having to hurdle Temple, Tech,
and Georgetown before clinching
the league title for the third straight
season.

Their Big Chance

Friday will be the day of days for
some of the gridiron artists, the cru-
sading cagers, the tottering track-
men, et al. They are those who are
going to warm up and then go out
there and die for the glory of Alma
Mater.

You’ve guessed it. They are the
ones whom the coaches have been
saving for the Junior Prom.

Kitty, Kitty, Cat
Pat Corr, if he isn't. superstitious,
has all the reason in the world to re-
spect the traditional black cat. On
the way to Ohio State one walked un-

der one of the rear wheels of his car. I

The jinx didn’t begin to work until
Corr neared Columbus when a fan
belt broke. Then on Saturday after-
noon he saw his swimming team get-
ting a large share of bad breaks and

the short end of the score.

Swimming Team
Faces Manhattan

Meets New York Squad Friday,
Buckeyes Down Panthers

Panther swimmers will face their
third league opponent of the season
Friday night when the Manhattan
college natators meet Coach Corr‘s
team in the Metropolitan club cool.

It will be the fourth team ‘in the
Eastern Collegiate swimming associa-
tion that the Panthers have met this
season. In past meets with confer-
ence foes Pitt has defeated Delaware
and Carnegie Tech and lost to Frank-
lin and Marshall.

Although the record of the Manhat-
tan team is not so impressive this
year as it has been in other years,
the Panthers are expecting a very
close meet.

Last Saturday at Columbus, Ohio
State defeated the Panthers 55 to 20.
The Buckeye swimmers won every
first place in piling up their large
number of points. The Pitt swimmers
were touched out of first places by
inches in the backstroke, 10.-0-yard
freestyle, and the 50-yard sprint.

The summary:

400-yard relay——VVon by Ohio State
(Bryant, Hagaman, Kessler, and VVil-

Riﬂers Win Five,
Lose Four Matches

Telegraph Wires Bring Good,
Bad News To Marksmen

During the current shooting season
the Panther varsity riﬂemen have
taken part in nine matches, the Pan-
ther team coming out on top in ﬁve
of the matches while dropping the

other four. All of the matches play-
ed have been of the telegrahpic
variety.

In the ﬁrst two matches at the
start of the season, January 12, the

varsity riﬂers took the measure of
two Brooklyn schools, the Brooklyn
Polytechnical Institute by a score of
1,367 to 1,297 and the Brooklyn Poly-
technical evening school, 1,387 to
1,325.

One week later the riﬂemen engag-
ed in a match with ﬁve other schools,
taking three of them to the cleaners
while bowing to the remaining two.
Georgetown, Boston university, and
John Hopkins fell prey to the Pan-
thers’ guns, while Cornell and V‘Vasl1-
ington were -the outﬁts that aimed
slightly better than the Pitt boys.

Later in the season both Ohio
State and Minnesota proved to be too
much for the varsity, Ohio State
whipping them by the close score,
1,375 to 1,367, and Minnesota, in the
only ten-man team match played by
the Panthers, won by a score of 2,747
to 2,663.

Monday the riﬂemen met
teams; Drexel Institute, Penn State,
VVashington University, Kansas State
College, Carnegie Tech, and the Har-
vard University riﬂe club. Scores
have not yet been determined.
