The Board of Regents, which

today at the request of state Gov-

Surprise Gift Covers
Add   to  Reservation

An unexpected gift to the University has covered the cost
' of the purchase of the Hubbard Reservation, announced last

Week, and will provide some additional funds to begin its
development for educational and other uses. . .

The gift, whichw,as announced last Thursday by acting
.Chanc_ellor Charles B..Nutting, was donated by Mrs. Alan

M. Scaife as an expression of belief in the importance of this

property for the University.

Known Before

Mrs. Scaife, in transmitting the gift, th

was"not announced, indicated that
she had known that acquisition of
this property by the University
had been under consideration for
some time.

After arrangements had been
concluded for the acquisition ‘of
the property from Kthe Boy
Scouts of America,. Allegheny
Council, she decided to‘ make a
gift which would reimburse‘ the
University for the cost of the
property and also provide. ad-
ditional funds toward its de-
velopment for University pur-
poses.

quest is “political and‘ 100‘ per

move “caused disgrace to our state

world.” 1.
Saturday, Georgia Tech stu-
dents paraded through the

streets of, Atlanta, surrounded
the Governor’s .mansion shout- ‘
ing “We want’ to play Pitt,” and
hanged the Governor in effigy.

In acknowledging the gift to

,“This is another ‘evidence of the

In making this gift, Mrs. Scaife
will enable us to realize use of
the property sooner and in a more

,otherwise have been possible. All
of us of the University express
our gratitude.” '

’ Careful Use

B Dr. Nutting also stated that
careful consideration will be given
toithe use of these funds,,so as to
be of greatest beneﬁt to students.

,The purchase of the Hubbard
Reservation. was announced by the
University last week. In telling of
the purchase of the tract of _173

_uses and athletics, physical educa-
tion, and social use by students

THE GIFT HORSE

Today's column is about Christmas gift suggestions, and I
suppose you think I'll begin by suggesting Phlllp Morr1s..Well,
the joke’s on you’. I’ll do no such thing. Why should I? Anyone

' with two brains to knock together,knows that Philip Morris

makes an absolutely smashing Christmas gift. Only a poor

. aﬁiicted soul with atrophied taste buds needs to be told about the’

new Philip Morris; its bracing ﬂavor; its freshness, lightness,
pleasantness, gentleness; its truth, its beauty, its brotherliness
in. this discordant world of ours. So why should I waste time
telling you what you already know? " -'

 

Let us, instead, turn to less obvious giftsuggestions. Here’s
one I bet you never thought of: ,

Christmas is the best time of year, but it..is also the beginning’
of winter. How about a gift that reminds one that though winter‘
has come, spring is not far behind? I refer, of course, to Easter
chicks. (Similarly, on Easter one can give Christmas chicks.)

Next, we take up the problem, common to-vall undergraduates, .
of trying to buy gifts when yo have no money. To this dilemma .

-I say-—F_augh! It is not the price of the gift that counts; it is the
, sentiment behind it. ‘

Take, for example, the case of Outerbridge Sigafoos. Outer--'
bridge,.a sophomore, ﬁnding himself without funds last Christ-
mas, gave his girl a bottle of good clear water and a nice smooth
rock, attaching this touching message to the gift:

‘ 1 H e're’s some water
And h'e're’s'a rock, .
I love you, dauglzter, . r
Around the clock. - A

penny!
I am compelled to’report, however, that Outerbridge’s girl did
not receive these offerings» in the spirit in which they were

tendered. In fact, she ﬂew into a ﬁt of pique, smashed the bottle. ,
"on the rock and stabbed Outerbridge with the jagged edge! But _:

the experience was not without value for Outerbridge. First, he‘

discovered that-the girl was not his type at all. Second, he learned

how to make a tourniquet. , ' 9 9
But I digress. Let’s examine now a common complaint of

And the whole delightful gift -co,st_Outerbridge less than a

Christmas shoppers: “What do you get for someone who has" ’

I everything ?”

To this I reply, ‘:Does he?” Does he, for instance, have a
unicycle? A sled dog? A serf ? Aburnoose? A hairball? A bung‘
starter? (The bung starter, incidentally, was invented by two
enormously talented men, Fred Bung and Otho Starter. Their

. partnership thrived from the very start, and there is no telling

to what heights they might have risen had they not split up
over a silly argument. It seems_that Bung was a ﬁrm believer in

reincarnation; Starter was just as ﬁrm a disbeliever. Bung in- -

sisted so violently on the truth of reincarnation and Starter
scoffed so positively that they ﬁnally decided to go their separate
ways. Singly, alas, the two» fared badly. Starter gave up business
altogether, joined the army, and was killed at San Juan Hill in
1898. He is today buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Bung
drifted from job to job until he died of breakbone fever in
Elizabeth, N. J., in 1902. He istoday a llama in Uruguay.)

Rugged Approach

V A . The South is ﬁghting hard to maintain segregation. The
brutal battle for states’ rights for caucas_1ons—be1_ng con-
ducted in the schools, in transportation, _in housing, has
now been extended to the All-American winter sport of
football. A -leading citizen of the state, of Georgia has spro-
’’tested to Georgia Tech the possibility that _a__ negro football
player may play on the opposing team in the Sugar;Bow1.

, In a telegram. to Coach Bobby Dodd of Tech, Hugl_1-G.
,Grant,_one of the founders of the States Rights Council of
Georgia and a member of the Board of Regents, argued
against “any breakdown of the laws, customs, and traditions”
ofthe Sduth. The States Rights Council is dedicated to the
preservation of racial segregation. ’ __ .

The telegram was to be expected. The replies from the

Pitt athletic department have been just as strong, and, of

course, no less could _be expected. An unidentiﬁed Univer-

sity spokesman stated that Bobby Grier, fullback who show-
ed such great potential mid-season and intercepted a pass

’ in the Penn State vgameto. put Pitt on its way to therSugar
Bowl,~will play. If'he’s good enough in practice he may start.

But the problem involves more than the game. Since

=”3‘é=v/’/{‘;T?.

 

players will be housed in Tulane ' dormitories, they’ll all .

. “sleep, eat, practiceand play together.” We understand that
‘the team will also tour New Orleans after the contest. Be-
— cause we don’t think that the Southern city willchoose as a

New Year’s-resolution to chan e its customs team members"
. 3

may not have the opportunity to see all.the sights.‘ At the
same time, they’ll receive an eyeful. ' _

In light of this problem’, the Sugar Bowl may actually
be the “big” game of the day—_—not only will bowl fans, tele-
vision viewers‘, and the nation’s newspapers View the sports
events, but nations throughout the world --will take ‘.‘time
out” to view the racial implication in New Orleans,through-
out the whole .week. - -. A

There are some people who feel this ‘University should
have refused the Sugar‘Bowl bid on moral grounds in light
of the racial implications. However, this is a stinking prob-
lem. To smother it, we must meet it head on. Segregation
foes and desegragation opponents will have. another ‘concrete
example on whichto argue. .
, Football’s a rugged sport. And the athletic departments
obviously know how to deal with rugged problems. Bobby
Dodd does not expect to have any comment. ‘

Students Against 'McCarran Bill . . .

+ Frightened Students

By Irv Rothman ,
In 19-53 a student who had begun to study the

Russian language at Pitt mentioned it in a. casual it

discussion to a patrolman. Referring to Commu-

Inistic tendenbies, thepoliceman warned him, “That’s

dangerous.”

The big “Red” scare was at its height then, with
both the Jenner and McCarthy
investigating committees con ,
demning persons known to have 
once belonged to front agencies. _

But since both senators have
been quieted down, the tumult
seems to have ceased. However,
the rabble-rouser inﬂuence still
pervades government policy, for
the McCarran Internal Security

   

the courts, lingers as a threat to citizen rights.

. Participation Condemned

It condemns participation in subversive activity
and is geared to Communism. It helps administrators
to judge those activities which are listed as sub-
versive on the “Loyalty Oath.”

Decisions on whether an organization is Com-

munist-front or not are based on criteria set up in’

Section 13, (f_), (4), “the extent to'which the posi-
.tions taken or ‘advanced by it from time to time on

mattersof policy do not deviate from those of a»

Communist-action organization. Communist foreign
government, or the world .Communist movement . .”
— ‘It is difficult to know to what extent organiza-
tions may function before the Securities Activities
Control Board takes action upon them—no deﬁnite
standards are measured; the bill is ambiguous.
There. is little wonder that people today are wary
to attach their names to any cause which may even
-hint of liberal participation—such cause may be
condemned at any time by the Board. ' '

_.Opposition Shown - J

The Bill, especially the Communist-front pro-
visions, is presently being protested by .the Labor
Youth League in the Court of Appealsifor the Dis-

appeal of the Act before the supreme court. ‘

Desegregution Communist-ic

These leaders stated that under the ‘act ‘fa youth »

SACB because the Communists favor desegregation.”
In the Apr. 1954 Redboolc, veteran reporter Andre-
Fontaine wrote: :;

Apparently the Panther grid
team has a couple of pretty .fair
ends. When the International News

came out two weekends ago, Pan-

A" week after the INS picks, the

Associated Press came out with
their All—America, and, to no-
body’s surprise, Panther ‘right end
John Paluck was listed on the
second team.

Paluck will be playing his last.

game for Pitt when. the team
travels to the Sugar Bowl next
month. After that the 220—pound
senior starts ﬂattening pro backs
for the Washington Redskins who
picked him up in the second round
of the NFL draft.

On the AP A1l—America choices,
two other Panthers received hon-

captain John Cenci, a senior, and
quarterback Corny Salvaterra, a

through the ﬁrst half, 29-15.

the half, Fenwick cashed in on a

Oklahoma Tops‘All-Opponent

As Harris Nips Welsh for QB

Oklahoma was not only the numbereone team in the coun-

try this season but the Sooners

also rated tops on the list with

the Panther griddersby placing three players on this year’s

Panther All-Opponent eleven.
West Virginia, Navy, and
placing two men each. Duke

team by placing one gridder apiece.
Bo Bolinger, the hard-hittingO-

Oklahoma guard, was the unani-
mous choice of the Panthers on
the basis of his early season per-
formance at Norman.

Bolinger’s teammate, 'hall‘back
Tommy McDonald, was the other
unanimous choice of the locals.
The 170-pound fleet-footed back
was the main reason the Pan-
thers were toppled in Soonerland
as he raced for two" touchdowns.

The other Sooner selection was
lace quarterback'Jim Harris. In
the voting, Harris just managed
to nose out Navy’s George Welsh
by a scant three ballots.
Altho_ugh‘“Welsh ' failed to make
the_f‘irst team, the Middies did
ﬁll

Ron Beagle at one end post and
Walt Whitmore at center.

Even though the Panthers man— '

aged to humble West Virginia’s'
Mighty Mountaineers_, the Mor-
egantowners did get two places on
the All-Opponent Veleven. Al.l
American Bruce Bosley tied down
one of the tackle positions while
ﬂashy Bobby Moss won the bal-
loting for the halfback ‘post.

, Penn- State’s co—captai.ns, Otto
Kneindinger and Earl Sghumaker,
’ gained positions in the ‘forward
wall byiﬁlling in at tackle and
guard, respectively.

Completing the forward wall
was Duke’s ace end Sonny Sorrell
who won out by only two votes
over‘ West Virginia’s Gene Pa-
petti. V V _

For the fullback slot, the Pan-
ther gridders voted almost unani-
mously for Virginia’s powerful

sophomore Jim Bakhtiar. Bakh-.

quired ‘only four months of ad-
