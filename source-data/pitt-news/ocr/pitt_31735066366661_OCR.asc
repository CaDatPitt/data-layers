UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Governor Fires

Education Head

Governor William W. Scranton has fired Charles G.
Simpson as chairman of the State Council of Higher Educa-
tion. Scranton replaced him with Frank Hawkins, editor of
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a member of the council and

the State Board of Education.

Simpson had been critical of the state adminis'tration’s

school policies, and was strongly
opposed to the work of college
lobbyists in Harrisburg. He also
blasted the State Senate over the
merits of the Senatorial scholar-
ships.

Scranton said, “Charley Simp-
son is very able and hard-work-
ing. Both are important qualities
. . . but you must also have ef-
fectiveness.” Scranton contended
that Simpson's critical statements
had adverse effects on the State
Board, the Superintendent of
Public Instruction, some legisla-
tors, university and college offi-
cials, and “the executive arm of

 " the government.”

The State Board of Education
consists of a seven-member Coun-
cil of Higher Education, a seven-
member Council of Basic Educa-
tion, and three members at large.
Its chief function is to develop
policies for all levels of public
education in Pennsylvania.

“I have not made this decision
lightly,” said Gov. Scranton, “and

5" I concluded that a change was

in order. I want to make it very
clear, however, that this decision
was not because of any attack on
this administration . . . and I
have asked Mr. Simpson to re-
main as a member of the State
Board.”

Simpson has refused to resign
his post. “I have declared loudly

vg». that I don’t quit anything, and

I’m not quitting this thing,” he

declared. Simpson charged that‘

there has been a “vacuum in the
leadership, and there is a rebel-
lion and revolution going on
against political appointments to
State college boards, and sena-
torial scholarships with their pol-
itical patronge plums.” Referring
to himself, he added that “in all

To Discuss
Literature

Colin Wilson, author of The

sider, will be the third Public
Affairs Series lecturer Wednes-
day at noon in the Student Union
Ballroom. His topic will be “The
Revolution in Literature."

Wilson, a native of Leicester,

<3” “England, published his first work,

The Outsider, in his early twen-
ties. The book was a criticism of
modern civilization that became
a major critical success. His latest
book, Beyond the Outsider: The
Philosophy of the Future, is a
continuation of this theme.

worthwhile revolutions there are
casualties.”

He recalled that State Senator
Albert Pechan, Ford City Repub-
lican and Senate Majority Whip.
had called for his resignation be-
cause he (Simpson) couldn’t
“agree with the boss.”

“I presume,” said Simpson, “the
Govemor’s thinking here is re-
ﬂected by what Sen. Pechan said
. . . that I ought to get the hell
out and also, if I couldn’t agree,
I couldn’t be objective. However,
I can take all of this in good
humor.”

Simpson will continue to be a
member of both the Council of.
Higher Education and the State
Board of Education.

The new chairman, Frank Hawk-

- ins, does not require Senate con-

ﬁrmation, as is regularly the case,
since he is already a member of
the Board and Council.

Desires Student Invo

By NANCY FUCHS

New Student Government (SG)
President Ralph Manning gave
a plea for unity in his inaugural
address at the SG Banquet Thurs-
day night. “Tonight, let us try
to think as one rather than as
many,” he said.

Speaking with a conviction that
the new Senate will not become
bogged down, with the formal-
ities of extended debate, Man-
ning told the group: “Senators,
we shall not eliminate debate, but
yet we shall not merely become
a forum for the debating of po-
litical, social, moral, or philoso-
phical ideas with no attempt to
provide practical beneﬁt‘ to the
students.”

He plans to achieve his goals
by having weekly meetings on
Wednesday evenings and coor-
dinating the “work of the various
senate chairmen through the Cab-
inet and the legislative commit-
tee.” This group will consist of
the president, vice-president, spe-
cial assistant to the executive,
president pro tempore, and “any
other cabinet official in charge
of that issue.”

His main purpose in taking this
action is to “reduce the amount
of friction in the senate and to
eliminate the so-called ‘uninform-
ed’ senators.” He urged the reso-
lution of disputes outside the
Senate, “saving both the time
and the dignity of the. Senate.”

Speaking on student involve-
ment, Manning said: “Eric Stern
was condemned on this campus
not because of what he stood for,

speech at installation banquet Thursday night.

but because the idea of student
involvement is a new one.” He
promised “to strive to achieve
the dream of student involvement.
which ﬁrst came to life on this
campus last year.”

Manning’s deﬁnition of student
involvement is “the creation of
a mature, responsible and ration-
al student body capable of gov-
erning itself in an atmosphere,
not charged with emotionalism
but dedicated to clear-headed ac-
tion.” ‘

Following Manning’s talk with

a few brief remarks, outgoing ,

Senator and_Master of Cere-
monies Ludwig Hayden said: .“I
proposed that the progress of the
outgoing SG has been one of
apathy to awareness. He urged
the adoption of the new constitu-
tion.

The new officers and senators
took their oaths of office at the
banquet. Outgoing President
Jerry Hogan presented awards
to Dyanne Hockman as the out-
standing organization vice-presi-
dent on the senate, and to Jim
Janis and John Ruskay as the
most. outstanding senators.

Professors Debate Importance and Goals of Dissent;
Views Differ Concerning the Vietnamese Conflict

‘DR. MORRIS BERKOWITZ
Discusses Viet Question

By HOBART HARRIS

Toward whom debate should
be directed rather than the ex-
tent to which it should be per-
mitted was the discussion of the
Liberal Forum Thursday at the
University Lutheran Center. Dr.
Morris Berkowitz, associate pro-
fessor of sociology, and Dr. Don-
ald Cheever, professor in the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, gave their
views on the “The Limits of De-
bate on Vietnam.”

Berkowitz began the discussion
by disagreeing with the wording
of the resolution on the grounds
that “Freedom of dissent’ is not
related to issues, but to itself”
_ and maintained that the
right to dissent is independent of
the situation which the dissenter
is hoping to inﬂuence. The only
exception Berkowitz saw to this
idea is when the dissent present-
ed, in Justice Oliver Wendel
Holmes’ words “a clear and pre-
ent danger.” Berkowitz believed
that the Vietnam dissent does
not constitute such»a danger.

Deadline for applying—fo-r_tl1~e_'
Army ROTC two-year program
ir March 1st.

Applications must be submit-
ted to Lt. Col. Benjamin Hollis
in 431 C.L. ’

This prognam requires a 6
week Summer Camp this year
instead of a. 6 month camp as
previously reported.

He then turned to what he
considered to be a “severe ero-
sion of controversy in American
society,” which he traced toilthe
Korean War. At that time, he
said, the public, and especially
the Congress, abdicated their

right to dissent over foreign po-‘

licy.

This, according to Berkowitz,
produced a state of affairs where
the executive assumed almost un-
challenged control over Ameri-
can foreign policy—“a limited
constitutional democracy in for-
eign affairs.”

Berkowitz asserted that this ab-
dication led to the general pub-
lic’s placing those people who
have continued to disagree with
the administration in the “. . .
nick” category, since their seem-_
ingly exists no “responsible” seg-
ment of the country which is op-
posed to our policy. This in turn
fosters an atmosphere where
such undemocratic practices as
travel restrictions to Communist
countries, punitive use of the
draft, and the refusal of medi-
care privileges to people who re-
fuse to sign anti-communist oaths
are accepted virtually without
protest, he said.

Finally, he referred to the hy-
steria which he feels has been‘
building up over the war. He felt
this was the main threat to free
speech in that it fosters an in-
tolerant mood among the elec-
torate.

Dr. Cheever began by stating
that he did not want to see free
speech limited any more than Dr.
Berkowitz did, but stressed that

it should be directed towards the -

Congress because the executive
cannot be frank with the public
without jeoparadizing the govem-
ment’s ability to negotiate free of
prior commitments, or engage in

power politics if it cannot main- ‘
tain secrecy over its intentions.

He saw the government’s func-
tion as “the preservation of its

range of options. When we dis-"
sent, we must realize .that we "

are living in a word where A force

is the arbiter of much of what,

happens.”

In this light, Cheever agreed
with Berkowitz that South Viet-
nam was a pawn, but maintained
that the conﬂict was a matter of
“whose pawn?” He felt that-it

was more likely that the Vietna-A ;
mese could get a free choice of

govermnent only if the United
States prevailed in. the war.

Editorial: Regressive Education

The firing of Charles Simpson, chairman of the State Council on Higher Education,
 as another high point in Pennsylvania s regressive educational policy. Simpson was
fired because Governor William Scranton felt he was ineffective. .
 Scranton, however, described SiInpson’s alleged ineffectiveness by saying Simpson
 made critical statements which had adverse effects on several legislators, educational
groups, and “the executive arm of the government.”
Further substantiation of Sirnpson’s alleged ineffectiveness came from the honorable
xxsenatbr Ajbert Pechan, a member of the University’s Board of Trustees. Pechan urged
“Simpson to resign because he “couldn’t agree with the b _ _
‘ In effect, Simpson was not ineffective, he was critical. He pointed to the infringe-
ment of political power plays on the educational policy of the State. He criticized Senators
who abused their state scholarship awards, political appointments to State college boards,
and the fervent work of lobbyists for colleges. . _
 ’ He represented a view trying to give some freedom to education; to give some voice

ance systems for Russian mis-
siles and consorting with the ene-
my. Quite the contrary.
Buying wheat means that mil-
lions of dollars that might have
been spent on anti-missile sys-
tems and other military expendi-
tures are diverted to grain pur-
chases essential — for human and
animal diet. Not only do these
sales reduce our tremendous sur-

 ._ pluses and in mm, grain storage

costs, but they help United States
balance of payments by bring-

. ing gold into this country. If we

don't negotiate more wheat sales,

‘A Canada and some of our allies

will, as they have done in the
past.

Regardless of what the United
States does or hopes, Russia will
not starve. We would deprive
ourselves of this real, positive
way of beneﬁting from Commun-
lsm’s failures. It is not worth put-
ting aside unfounded “conspira-
cy” cries to derive direct econo-

 .mic gain at the expense of our

, enemies?

Compromise Key

To Politics

Editor, The Pitt News:
“Statements lacking in good

' taste or fair play will be reject-

ed.” So -reads your instructions
for writing letters to the editor.
Yet, Jan 28, The Pitt News print-
ed the column by Alan Disler,
“Fight Fire with Fire.” Disler
himself jeers the “Liberal Peanut
Gallery” for condemning anti.
Communist measures.

He asks, “If we resort to their

'. tactics aren't we the same as they
 are?” The answer is really,

 

from either country mean resent-'
ment for the other side.

No country is “inﬁnitely superi-
or” to another, morally or ma-
terially. The Soviet Union “stamp-
ed its character for time in the
bloody streets of Budapest” while
the United States, at the turn
of the century, stamped its char-
acter on the bloody island of
Cuba in the Spanish-American
War. More recently, our people
have shown their morality on
the bloody streets of Birming-
ham. The Soviet Union improves
her standards using Communist
methods she developed in the
past, just as the United States
uses the capitalistic methods she
developed. We just got a 60 year
head start in industrialization.

Disler links the United- States
with “Absolute Good” and Rus-
sia with “Absolute Evil.” This
will hold true if the US. em-
ploys “love your enemies” which
is absolute good, instead of “an
eye for an eye,” as Disler’s title,
“Fight Fire with Fire” implies.
If “realism is the key, we must
face the Soviets at the conference
table with this attitude to solve
problems, instead of provoking

them with ﬁrm stands and ac-

tions.

Continues Cause

Editor, The Pitt News:

The news of the death of Act-
ing Chancellor Stanton Crawford
was a great shock to me and an
even greater disappointment. In
the brief span of time that I was
fortunate enough to Dr- Craw-
ford, I found him to be the sim-
ple, but beautiful person that
Fred Frank painted in his Jan.
28 article. His loss will be felt
especially hard because of the
University’s continued condition
of transition.

The appointment of Dr. David
Kurtzman as his successor is a
Very disturbing move in a _direc-
tion -alluded to  summer by

a short-lived organization named
Students for Litchﬁeld. At that
time we pointed out that unless
the students voiced their con-
cern for the University’s academ-
ic commitment, the next chan-
cellor might be nothing more
than a gloriﬁed bookkeeper. Rec-
ognizing that Dr. Kurtzman’s is
only an interim appointment, it
still points up the ascendency of
ﬁnancial interests with relation
to academic interests.

In memory of the ideals that

Dr. Crawford stood for, and in .

the hope that they are not for-
gotten, I am sending in $6.50,
the last of the money that Stu-
dents for Litchﬁeld collected to
the Stanton C. Crawford Memori-

The Review o «

I personally am in complete accord with the goals of
Project Teach, but I'm not sure that the present plan will
work out for the best.  think the best way to _review cours-
es and faculty is not with polls and questionnaires, but with .
the Time-tested method of the professional critic, writing 
his opinions in the mass media, like The Pitt News, for  ‘

   to read and consider. - _-
Since the reviewer would be a profession-
al, he would not ‘be subject to. pressure from
the faculty he is reviewing, other than the
hate letters and threats of violence that cri-
tics are accustomed to. But professional _re-
viewers in this country are used to working
with movies and the theater,_ not with aca-
demics. How would such a critic fare? Per-
haps somewhat like this . . . ,3
. SCIENCE 80 is a bold /attempt to shed
CIKOSKI light on the age-old question, “Can man find
love among the atoms ?,” and sometimes it succeeds. Pro-
fessor Ed Wingle is at the helm of this long-awaited serio-

"comic portrayal of the White-Coat set, but in this his third ,

appearance at the Clapp Hall podium he lacks much of the
polish of his earlier performances. _

But no one can blame the material. Newton, Aristotle,
and others have managed to pen great lines about subjects
that are boring at best. Newton's Apple scene is a potential 
scream (Best Line: What goes up must come down!), but -4
Wingle -does not rise to the challenge. The old bathtub bit
is given new twists by gagster Archimedes of Greece, but
again Wingle proves that golden lines can fall like lead if
not handled with finesse. U , _ .

IN FACT the slow start suggests that Wingle has turn-
ed Science into Sighence, but about halfway through the
fourth yawn a subtle change takes place. Darwin has entered
the script, and Wingle illustrates the evolution of monkey
to man with heart—felt gusto. This is Wingle’s meat-and-
potatoes and he plays it to the hilt. “Survival,” he cries at "
one point, “Is for the fittest!” and his flunking of half the ,
class is a brilliantly conceived example. . ' ' 1

But the course does not live up to expectations. Wingle’s
monkey portrayal is certainly convincing, but the rest of
science is lost in the shuffle of indifferent delivery and stale_
jokes. In short, one should take this course not for the

‘ essence, but for the ape. '

ROOMMATES: THEIR ‘CAUSE AND CURE

You'd think that with all the progress we have made in
the education game, somebody would have found a cure

for roommates by now. But no.'Roommates remain as big».

a problem today as they were when Ethan Mather founded
the first American college.
(Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was not the ﬁrst.

- Mr. Mather started his institution some 100 years earlier.

And quite an institution it was, let me tell you! Mr. Mather
built schools of -liberal arts, ﬁne arts, dentistry and tan-
ning. He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 200,000.
Everywhere on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin
motto CAVE M USSI —“Watch out for moose.” The stu-
dent union contained a bowling alley, a weighing ma-
chine, and a sixteen-chair barber shop.)

(It was this last feature—~the barber shop—-that, alas,
brought Mr. Mather’s college to an early end. The student
body, being drawn chieﬂy from the nearby countryside,
was composed almost entirely of Pequot and Iroquois In-

dians who, alas, had no need of a barber shop. They,

braided the hair on top of their heads, and as for the hair on
their faces, they had none. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle
by name, grew so depressed staring day after day at 16 emp-

' ty chairs that one day his mind gave way. Seizing his vibra-
tor, he ran outside and shook the entire campus till it crum-
bled to dust. This later became known as Pickett’s Charge.)
But I digress. We were exploring ways for you and your

‘ roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly

A diﬂicult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit,

give a little.

I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz
’O8). My roommate was, I think you will allow-, even less
agreeable than most. He was a Tibetan named Ringading
whose native customs, while indisputably colorful, were
not entirely endearing. Mark you, I didn’t mind so much
the gong he struck on the hour or the string of ﬁrecrack-
ers he set off on the half hour. I didn’t even mind that he
singed chicken feathers every dusk and daybreak. What I
did mind was that he singed them inmy hat.

‘nu  . ‘.

  

'lb be fair, he was not totally taken with some of my
habits either—especially my hobby of collecting water. I
had no jars at the time, so I just had to stack the water
any-old—where.

Well, sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringa-
ding and me, and they might actually have gotten ugly
had we not each happened to receive a package from home
one day. Ringading opened his package, paused, smiled
shyly at me, and offered me a gift.

“Thank you," I said. “What is it?”

“Yak butter,” he said. “You put it in your hair. In Ti-
betan we call it gree see kz'dstu1f.”

“Well now, that's mighty friendly,” I said and offered him
a gift from my package.“Now you must have one of mine.”

“Thank you," he said. “What is this called?”

“Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades,” I said.

“I will try one at once,” he said. And did.

“Wowdow l” he cried. “Never have I had such a smooth,
close, comfortable, shave!" .

“Ah, but the best is yet!” I cried. “For you will get
many, many smooth, close, comfortable shaves from. your
Personna Blade—each one nearly as smooth, close, and
comfortable as the ﬁrst !”

“Wowdow l” he cried.

_ “Moreover,”. I cried, “Personna Blades come lmth in
Double Edge style and Injectorstyle !”
“Sort of makes a man feel humble,” he said.
“Yes,” I said.

We were both silent then, not trusting ourselves to F

speak. Silently we clasped hands, friends at last, and I am‘
proud to say that Ringading and I remain friends to this

day. We exchange cards each Christmas ‘and ﬁrecrackers . I

each Fourth of July.

Being shutout in a wrest-
ng meet is not the most
frequent statistic ever re-
orded, but the wrestling
team has stretched its luck
twice in "that area thus far
 season.
‘A ‘Against Navy the wrestlers nar-
rowly averted a whitewash when
Dino Boni decisioned his oppon-
jent 2-1. The latest escape from
-the zero column came Saturday
 Big Ten champ Michigan
swamped the matmen, 28-3.
I Randy Kahlor’s 5-4 victory over
«Wayne Wentz provided.the only
exception to the Wolverine string
of victories.
, Despite the discouraging score
‘coach Dave Johnson wasn't that
upset. “Even thonfh it doesn't
look like it on paper, the kids
really tried this time,” said John-
son. “They had the right atti-

 

tude, but they were just out-
classed.”
Winner of 37 of its last 38

dual meets, Michigan had solid‘

strength all the way down the
roster. Even Eastern champ Dino
Boni found his opponent, Cal
Jenkins more than he could han-
‘dle, losing 4-1.

“Jenkins is a real good wres-
tler,” said Johnson. “It would
have been a close match no mat-
ter where it was wrestled.”

Michigan picked up 10 of its 28
points at opposite ends of the ros-
ter. In the 123 pound division,
Bob Fehrs pinned Tony Liberati
after a little more than two min-
utes of the ﬁrst period. Fehrs is
the defending Big Ten Confer-
ence champ at 123.

In the heavyweight class, it
only took sophomore Dave Por-
ter one and a half minutes to pin
Terry Hoover. Porter was the
Michigan state ‘champion in high
school.

“Their 123 pounder and heavy-
weight were the best kids they
had,” said Johnson. “I watched
Porter wrestle in the Olympic
summer camp last year and it's
a good bet that he'll be the na-
tional champ in a year or so.”

In the other matches, Dave
Dozeman decisioned Dick Shildt,
11-2, at 130. Team captain Bill
Johannessen (137) handled Ron
Schuchert with ease, 7-0.

In a high scoring match at 152
pounds, Bert Merical outpointed
Jim Rhone, 13-8. Clair Riley drop-
ped a close match, 4-1, to Fred
Spehan in the 160 division, and
Bill Waterman (167) decisioned
Tim Trax, 6- . '

There was no match at 191
since the Big Ten hasn't added
that weight class to their lineup

 "Swimmers Lose Twice
Despite Freestyler Lane

By GEORGE LIFS I

- New York spelled double-trouble for the swimming
' team over the weekend. First at Hamilton, the swimmers
dropped a 64-31 loss to Colgate. On Saturday, they lost to
. Syracuse, 51-44 despite setting two pool records.

In both losses, John Lane did all he could to stem the
‘tide. At Colgate, Lane won the 200 an-d the 500-yard free-

until you can get used to the
pool,” Grady continued. “But in
Lane's case, he did a wonderful-
job.” Commenting on Lane's four
ﬁrst places in two meets, Grady
described him as a “true ath-
lete.”

“We couldn’t get adjusted to
the pool at Colgate,” said Grady,
“but at Syracuse we were worn
out. Syracuse had enough swim-
mers to save their sprinters for
the (400-yard) freestyle relay
which broke the 44-44 tie and
lost it for us.”

“The boys did more than I ex-

~ pected at Syracuse, but I had to
juggle the lineup to get the first
44 points,” Grady said.

Against the Orangemen, the
swimmers broke two pool records.
Backstroker Joe LeViere had a
hand in each. He won his spe-
cialty, beating out teammate Rus
ty Lindberg. LeViere also start-
ed the 400-yard medley’ relay
which resulted in another new
mark.

Dick Hulme, who has not been
swimming very much so far this
season, surprised coach Grady
over the weekend.

Cadets Outclass
Panthers; Off-day
Hurts Gymnasts

The Panther gymnasts
dropped their fifth meet of
the year to an impressive
Army team by the score of
162.80-147.50. The Cadets
defeated the Panthers by
sheer weight of numbers. The
Army squad numbered 23, while
nine men make up the Panther
squad. The Cadets used only two
men, Howie Pontuck, captain of
the squad, and Dick Kent, more
than once.

In a gymnastic meet, the vis-
iting team has the option of us-
ing an all-around man. If the
visiting team uses an all-around

man, each team may enter four ,
men in an event. In the events ,

team can only have three men.

entered. In previous meets, Dave
McKinnis has been the Panther’s
all-around man. Army chose not
to use an all-around man, and in-
stead used specialists in every
event. '

The Panther gymnasts had an
off day, scoring ten points below
the 157 they compiled against
Kent State two weeks ago. Jim
Sacco, who was sixth in the all-
around competition in the East-
ern Intercollegiate Gymnastic
Championships last year, could
do no better than three fourth
places. Dave McKinnis took a

Falenski Sparks Upset
Try Despite Leg Injury

By JAY ROSENSTEIN ,
New York, Feb. 5-Stan Falenski returned to the Pan-

ther lineup Saturday against Fordham, but even his game
efforts weren’t enough to prevent the hoopsters’ fifth

straight loss, 66-60.

Playing on a knee that could have given Way at almost
any time, Falenski scored 16 points in the greuling contest.

He was taken out of the game
with 3:29 left after having hit

seven for 14 key baskets from -

the ﬂoor.
The hoopsters were behind, 62-

54, at the time and it seemed that .

Falenski should have been one
of the last men to be replaced.
When asked about the move,
coach Bob Timmons explained
that “we had to chase the ball.
That involves a lot of quick stops
and starts and I didn't want Stan
to go through that grind.

“We'll need him for the rest of
the season, so there was no rea-
son to risk him tonight,” Tim-
mons added. Falenski himself felt
good during the game. “I hardly
noticed the knee,” Falenski said.
“Maybe it was the trainer’s tape
job.” .

Fordham appeared to have taped
the basketball to the inside of
their basket the way they shot as
compared to the Panthers. The
Rams made 23 ﬁeld goals, the

hoopsters made 23. The differ-

ence was that the cagers took 77
shots. That's less than 30 per cent.

Larry Szykowny scored '20
points, made several clutch steals
and played his usual role as
quarterback of the offense, but
he was one of the prime offend-
ers. Szykowny managed to make
only seven of 23 attempts.

He fouled out with 3:29 re-.

maining with four ‘of the ﬁve
fouls—oﬂ!ensive charging calls.
As both Szykowny and Falenski
departed at the same time, Tim-
mons inserted Pete Smith and
Frank Famularo to press. But
they couldn’t take up the slack.
Outside of Szykowny, Falenski
and Bob Lovett who contributed

20 points of his own, the Pan-
thers had no one else to help.
That trio scored 56 of the 60
point total.

Roth McNally started at the
corner spot for the cagers as
Timmons felt that he could shoot
effectively against’ the Fordham
zone. McNally, however, took

ﬁve shots in the game and didn't

make any. _
“He can’t miss in practice,”
Timmons said. “But when Mc-

.. Nally gets in the game, he tight-

ens up.” ~

The hoopsters jumped into the
lead by playing a tight zone de-
fense that throtled Fordham for
the ﬁrst six or seven minutes.
Szykowney and Lovett gave the
Panthers a seven point edge, 12-5.

But Fordham bounced right
back. Led by Bill Langheld and
Joe Frangipane, they pulled even
and forged ahead, 29-28, at the
half. Both Rams hurt the hoop-
sters all nigh . Both had 20
points. ‘ ‘

“‘FrangiDane kept sneaking in-

side for quick iayups,” Timmons ’

said. “We couldn’t keep him out.”
Frangipane /helped Fordham open
up a seven point lead in the sec-
ond half.

But Szykowny and Falenski
brought the Panthers back to 52-

' 50 with eight minutes to go; Then

Timmons called a timeout to
clarify certain defensive adjust-
ments that the cagers were to
make. The strategy session seem-
ed to snap the hoopsters’ mo-
mentum. After the timeout Ford-
ham widened their lead to 62-52
and were never headed.

Cubs in Point Park Rematch

The freshmen basketball team did it again. They
won (their fifth straight victory), they avenged an early
season defeat, and they almost lost the ball game after

enjoying several comfortable
leads. The Cubs achieved all
three by edging Point Park, 78-
77, Saturday night at Baldwin
High.

During Christmas vacation, the
frosh lost to Point Park,_ 106-105,
in double overtime after leading
ten points.

This time the Cubs hel_d sever-
al leads of nine or ten points,
but each time the other team
whittled the deﬁcit. Frank Cle-
ments, Cubs’ leading scorer with
19, explained, “I guess we lag-
ged a little on defense. They
came down court and caught
Dave (Welty) and I on a couple
of picks. our defense left a lot
to be desired.” Clements also
thought that the week's layoﬂ

"hurt the team.

The game really had a hectic
ﬁnish. Tim Fisher replaced Cle-
ments, who had fouled out, with
Point Park leading by one. He
made a layup to put the frosh
ahead. Point Park regained the
one point edge but missed a free
throw with six seconds left. Al
DiFrischia; who also scored 19
points, cleared the rebound and
ﬁred down court to Dave Welty.
Welty whipped a. great pass to
Fisher, who scored the winning
basket on a short jumper.

You only know
the hallo it.

0ur'business no longer hangs by a ﬁber—cellulosic or otherwise. Far from it. We’re
researching, producing and marketing a rich range of products—chemicals, plastics,
paints and coatings, forest products, petroleum and natural gas products, as.well as a
full family of man~made ﬁbers—all over the world.

“Celanese’ sales growth, its hefty interests in chemicals and its hugely expanded foreign
operations have already moved it into a big new class,” said a CHEMICAL WEEK*
special report.

During the 10 years prior ‘to 1964, sales more than quadrupled, chalking up a growth
rate more than six times that of all U. S. manufacturing industries. And the trend is

_ stronger than ever, with corporate sales for 1965 estimated at 23% higher than last

year’s record of $701 million.
What does this mean to you?

Since our future expansion depends on our continued ability to develop top-notch
people, it is, after all, in our best interest to bring you along as fast as you can take it,
and give you all the support you need— in your technical specialty or in management.
