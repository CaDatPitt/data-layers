SGB VOWS
help on
summer
housing

problems
BYJim Iakely

Managing Editor

Every summer, hundrecls
of students and all their
belongings are stranclecl in
l’itIsburgh for two weeks
when the dorms close
between terms. This stirri-
mer might be cliﬂei‘etit if the
Student (‘.o\'c-mment Boarcl
can help it.

Pitt student \‘('illiam
(.i()ll;ll/. came to the SUB for
help after‘ he said a meeting
with Housing Director‘ Bob
Hopkins to help solve his
problem were fniitless.

(Jollat/. said that he
approached Hopkins about
finding storage space clur—
ing the two, one-week hia-
tus‘ between the summer
tenns but that Hopkins was
insensitive to his plight. He
said that Hopkins told him
that 250 students were
insignificant when there are
many renovations that must
be made in the donns dur-
ing the summer.

Gollatz, a recent transfer
to Pitt, said that he never
had a problem at this when
he was a student at l)rexel.
Hopkins was unavailable
for comment at presstime.

SGB President Jacob
Brrxly said that after Gollatz
submits a written statement
describing his problem, the
SGB will do everything it
can to help him.

Board member Brian
Bolton has plans for revis-
ing the ovemight guest poli-
cy currently in place for the
university dorms. He said
that the current policy is not
beneficial to the students.

“Under the current policy,
the university is being your
parent,” Bolton said. “The
university should be adjust-
ing the students to the adult
world."

He would like to reduce
the number of guests that a
resident could have at one
time from five to three
while increasing the num-
ber of times a resident
could have an overnight
guest.

“Say you're a freshman
and your friends visit Pitt to
see how it is," Bolton said.
“How are they going to see
how Pitt is if they can’t stay?

Major reception...

A reception to welcome back former and current Pitt football coach Johnny Majors was held yesterday in the
William Pitt Union Ballroom. Majors replaces Paul Hackett, who resigned in late November.

"It is very exciting [to be back in Pittsburgh,]" Majors said. "It is most challenging and I have a major job to get

The event, sponsored by the Golden Panthers, was a "good opportunity for Majors to be reunited to those who knew
him during his previous time at Pitt and for other fans to meet him as well," said Mike O'Brien, director of
Development for Athletics.

O'Brien said that the event was very informal and the turnout was nice. Pitt's Blue and Gold Society helped host the

Anti-Harassment Policy
Statement adopted by Pitt

ByThanita Adams
For7bePluNews

Reacting to what Chancellor _].
Dennis O‘Connor called “an
apparent rising tide of bigotry and
intolerance" in a recent memo, the
University of Pittsburgh has adopt-
ed a formal Anti-Harassment
Policy Statement.

The policy states that, “No
University employee, University
student or individual on University
property may intentionally harass
or abuse :1 person (physically or
verbally) with the purpose or
effect of unreasonably interfering
with such persons work or acade-
mic perfomiance, or of creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive
work or academic environment."

Like the University Non-
discrimination Policy Statement,
the new policy prohibits harass-
ment based on, “race, color, reli-
gion, national origin, ancestry, sex,
age, marital status, familial status,

sexual orientation, disability or ve.t—
eran status.”

Working with O'Connor is the
Office of Alfimiative Action, which
has issued several new brochures,
including one titled, “Combatting
Discrimination Based on Sexual
Orientation.”

The prohibition of discrimina-
tion based on sexual preference
was added to University policy in
1988, one year before it was
added to city ordinance, said
William A. Savage, assistant to the
chancellor and director of
Alfimiative Action.

The University Nondis-
crimination Policy itself was
revised in March 1992 to include a
preamble based on a “statement of
value, beyond simply obeying the
law," Savagesaid

“The revised policy explicitly
prohibits harassment and takes a
pro—active approach. We’re going

to do more than just not discrimi-

Campus police arrested
Homewood 15-year-old

By John Temple

Staﬂ Writer

Campus police arrested a 15-year-old from Homewood
Friday at midnight after seeing him beating a male Pitt stu-
dent on Fifth Avenue near Bouquet Street.

The teenager punched the 20-year-old victim in the face
several times, knocking him down and possibly breaking his
jaw. The approaching officers then saw the suspect kick the
prone student repeatedly until one officer pulled him off.

The teenager shoved the officer and ran, but the officers
caught him after a short chase and anested him for aggravat-
ed assault.

“It looks like a pretty cut—ancl-cliy case since the officers
saw the assault," Assistant Director of Public Safety Walt
Waters said. “They took him down to Shuman ll)etention
Centerl since he was a juvenile."

The victim was taken to the hospital for a possible broken
jaw, a cracked tooth and a swollen eye.

In another case, a male student reported on Feb. 5 that he
had been assaulted by three unknown males on University
Drive five (lays earlier.

The three men punched and kicked the student after he
left his fraternity house at midnight, according to the victim,
who said that he went to Forbes Metropolitan Health Center
in Wilkinsburg later in the day for facial injuries.

At a time of greatly need«
ed linancial ;issistaiice for
the massive Jewisli exodus
to Israel and for various
local Jewish community pro-
jects, Jews must lltlllllll their

contributing to charity, said
an Israeli rabbi at a lS‘nai
liritli Hillel teletlion that
started Sunday.

“Jewish people need to be
sensitized to the unique
Jewish concept of charity,"
said Rabbi Dr. Nachum
Amsel, a director of the one-
year program at Bar Ilan
University in Israel.

“We have to give charity
‘cause that is part of the
soul of the Jewish people.
We know all about misfor-
tunes like being slaves
‘cause our history is full of
such things.”

B'nai Brith Hillel has
three-day telethon

Aiiisel spoke about the

philosophical meaning of

charity to Hillel members
during a break front the
phones as an inspiration for
the telethon. He explained
that the concept ot‘ giving
for _]udaisin and (,Ilii'istianity
is dillei‘ent.

The Christian religion
teaches its followers to
donate as a sign of love, but

Jews are obligated to give

charity whether they love
the person ()I' not, according
to Amsel.

To illustrate the differ-
ence, he showed the silent
French movie “Clown"
about a sad 8-year-old boy
looking for his lost dog. He
searched for days vowing
not to give up. Then one
day, he found his dog
claimed by a blind man.
Without much hesitation,
the boy gave up his dog to

Electrical outburst...

Only two days after the Pi lambda Phi fraternity spent $4,000 to replace the electri-
cal work, an electrical outlet burst into ﬂames at the house on North I)ithridge Street
in Oakland.

According to the fraternity’s President Jeremy Weiss, he and other members of the
fraternity were playing a pool game around 9:30 p.m. Sunday when the fire began.

Weiss quickly put out the ﬂames with a nearby fire extinguisher, and then called the
fire department as an added precaution.

Weiss, the lnterfratemity Council president, added that the house was inspected by a
city fire inspector just last week. The electrical work had not been approved by the
city of Pittsburgh at that point. However, the inspection did take place, and according
to Weiss, no deficiencies were noted or brought to light.

In accondance with this empha-
sis on aﬁimiative action, O'Connor
implemented several suggestions
made by a Senate Task Force last
year concerning the ROTC pro-
gram on camptis. Effective last
March, O'Connor directed that the
following statement be printed on
“all appropriate catalogues and
brochures": “ROTC progrants dis-
criminate against students on the
basis of sexual orientation and

therefore are not in compliance
with the University's anti<liscn'mi-
nation policy."

\X/hile O'Connor did not adopt
the Task Force's suggestion of
removing ROTC programs from
campus, he is working with the
American Council on F.ducation,
the American Association of
Universities and the National
Associations of State and Grant
Institutions concerning this issue.

Savage added that the main rea-
son for allowing ROTC programs
to continue on campus is that

many students receive scliolarsliips
and lx'nefit_s through the programs
and would be. adversely affected
by their removal.

As of now, Clinton has signed
an executive order prohibiting
recruiters to ask about the sexual
orientation of new recruits, but the
ban itself is still in place.

on a university committee designed to ensure that stu-
dents’ academic needs are being met. ‘

Gradually he rose to the position of dean when fac-
ulty began to recommend him for the job.

Stewart said he loves to see hard work lead to suc-
cess, and he helps make this possible for students by
opening the university up to them rather than just
help them choose courses.

Stewart drew an interesting parallel between acade-
mics and athletics. “Students are like athletes. If you
want to be all you can be, you have to get out on the
track and run!”

In his spare time, Stewart said he likes to spend time
with his wife and two children backpacking in the
Cascade Mountains.

In his office, Stewart keeps a case of telegraph keys
used for Morse code, his other hobby, on display.

“I used to participate in speed Morse code, where
you are taught to think quickly before you speak. I
can identify a person by the way they send messages.
It’s like recognizing a song,” he said.

the old man.

The most pertinent scene,
according to Amsel, happened

when the boy was reunited‘

with his dog: he made sure the
old man did not hear him as
he said good-bye to the dog.

In interpreting this scene
from a Christian perspective,
Amsel said that the boy did
not have to hide from the old
man, because morally he
already fulfilled his burden.

Conversely, Amsel explained
that by not revealing his pres-
ence to the old man, the kid
acted as a Jew who has a duty
to remain inconspicuous about
donating.

The telethon callers seemed
inspired by the rabbi. “I’m not

really doing this for charity
purposes but more ‘toward
helping Jewish people around
the world,” junior Richard King
said.

“When I see the needs out
there, it makes me realize how
fortunate I am,” junior
Stephanie Zweig said. “I give
as much as I can afford, so
that I feel it and actually feel
the difference.”

At 2 p.m. Sunday the
telethon grossed $770 for local
and international Jewish caus-
es such as the Jewish
Community Center in
Pittsburgh, the Jewish Soviet
and Ethiopian Jewish immigra-
tion to Israel and the war in
Yugoslavia. The three—day
fund raiser will end on

Tuesday with an aspiration of

meeting last year’s sum of

$3,500.

All the donations benefit the
United Jewish Appeal, which
is the nation’s leading philan-
thropic organization. Amsel
said this proves that Jews take
charity seriously since they
total only 2 percent of the

nation’s population but have

the altruism to generate
America’s largest charity fund.

Karen Light, the UJA advisor
for Pitt and Carnegie Mellon
University, agreed. “I think it’s
wonderful that people come
here to make calls and dedi-
cate themselves to this cause.
This sends the message that
what we are doing is impor-
tant,” she said.

That is neglecting your freedom.”

Bolton is contacting Temple, Penn State, Ohio State
and Drexel for ideas for guest policy revision. He said
his goal is to simplify the complicated paper work
involved in signing in an overnight guest.

Plans for a racial diversity workshop are being
spearheaded by Bolton. The workshop will feature
various skits designed to  “each major issue
on campus when it comes to racial and cultural
clashes,” Bolton said. The workshop is designed as a
way for the students to get involved, he said.

Bolton said that any students who would like to
participate in a skit or become involved on any level
should get in touch with him at the SGB oﬂice.

Other selected issues discussed at last nights meet-
ing include:

0 Brody said that he has met with the members of
Pitt’s Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC)
about their concerns over Pitt’s involvement in the
construction of a telescope on Mt. Graham in
Arizona. He said he has scheduled a meeting with

0 Brody said he is talking to Assistant Vice
Chancellor of Business and Finance John Devitto
about putting a MAC machine in Sutherland
Hall.

0 The SGB is conducting a study to determine to
what extent the escort service, in its cunent state, is
needed.

0 Bolton is meeting Wednesday with Ron Brown,
head of the Advising Center’s Athletic Support
Services, to investigate complaints of athletes abusing
the services of the center.

“lAthletesl are students before they are athletes,”
Bolton said. “They have to take their academic
responsibility more seriously. I would like there to be
better supervision.”

0 Board member Joe Foner is stepping up his ran-
dom phone call polls to get a better feeling for stu-
dent concerns and is investigating a way to irnple—
ment the university computer network to reach even
more students.

0 President pro tempore Ted Schroeder said he is
meeting with the SGB lawyer about handling
Oakland landlord problems. He plans to set up a
seminar with Freshman Council to discuss apartment
hunting in Oakland.

campus area. While the powers that be at the University may not realize the dangerousness of the
Oakland streets, the students who risk their lives and property certainly do. Even drivers are no
longer safe as the new form of fun is to physically attack cars that stop for red lights.

While the University of Pittsburgh has continually increased its land size, the number of
University police officers to patrol the area have been decreased. Why not take some of the money
which the State allocates to the University and use it to make the streets of Oakland safe? I
challenge the Board and the Chancellor to come down onto their own campus on a Friday or
Saturday night around 12:30 a.m. to see the seriousness of the problem affecting their students. I
also encourage students, faculty, residents and Oakland business owners to support the city anti-
loitering law that is currently before City Council. It is about time that we gave Pittsburgh and
campus police the muscle necessary to clean up the streets of Oakland.

The Original Hot Dog Shop employs top security ofﬁcers inside the Original to provide all of our

Little right to know

Ever since President Wesley Posvar disclosed information about his
retirement package, the Right to Know Act has been a major issue
among legislators, faculty, alumni and students of the university.
Where and how the university’s money is spent is a concern to
almost everybody involved with the university. Tuition and student
fees are increasing. Faculty departments lobby for extra monies that
aren’t there. And the threat of cutbacks forever lingers. Still, most of
the costs remain the knowledge of a select few.

And we think they should.

House Education Committee Chairman Ron Cowell, D-Wilkins, dis-
agrees. He once again has decided to renew his fight and extend the
Right to Know Act — an act which essentially makes the university’s
budget public — to include Lincoln, Temple, Pitt and Penn State uni-
versities. Hopefully, the act will be defeated in favor of a much more
practical compromise.

The Right to Know Act would help eliminate certain costs and
make administrators more accountable. Expenses such as posh vaca-
tions and elaborate office fumiture would probably be reduced. But
such costs are slight, and with the exception of minor grumbling, do
little to affect the interworkings of the university.

Opening the university's budget, however, would cause serious
problems within the university community. The Right to Know Act as
it stands would make salaries public. Academia is an extremely corn-
petitive market place. Making salaries public could cause internal
strife within departments. between departments and throughout the
entire university. Costs would spiral upwards. and many faculty
members would leave. This is why. with the exception of top execu-
tives. most businesses conceal their internal pay information.

Since tax payers provide the public funding for this university, the
right to know where public funds are spent is a legitimate concern.
But the $153 million which taxpayers spend are but one half of the
funding Pitt receives. The other half is private and it should remain
S()

Extra funds for school

Last I)ecember, Texas Governor Ann Richards proposed a con-
stitutional amendment that would take a percentage of property
tax from the states wealthiest school districts and redistribute it to
the poorest ones. With the quality of education and student per-
formance slipping, our country needs to do something.
Iinfortunately, Richards’ amendment was not passed.

Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, with the same thing in
mind, will request $100 million more for local school districts in
the states 1993-")4 budget. He plans to funnel almost every bit of
it to the states poorest school districts, according to a Casey
Administration official.

In Pennsylvania there is almost an $8,000 difference in spending
per student between a wealthier district and a poorer district.
With this inequality there is no way that students from the poorer
districts can get out of their situations.

Two-hundred and twenty—eight of the state’s 501 school districts
will qualify for a portion of Casey’s request. To qualify for a piece
of the $100 million, a school district must be poor, which is mea-
sured by the incomes of the residents and the value of their prop-
erties; it must be levying comparatively high property taxes; and it
must be spending relatively little per pupil.

When you think of how cmcial an education is in this country
think of the people who were unfortunate enough to be born into
the poorer districts. These kids don't have the same opportunities
as those born in the wealthier ones. Computers, nutrition and
updated books are afforded only by the wealthiest schools. Kids

in poorer schools are condemned to an inferior education that.

may lead to an unfair shot at the future.

Terrorism a part of Israeli history

The article by Mike

Brittingham which appeared in
last Thursday's Pitt Neils requires
a proper response.

 

In seeking to “solve” the prob-
lems of the. Middle East, Mr.
Iirittingham engages in oppor-
tunistic Israel bashing while at
the. same time proclaiming the
innocence of the 400 members of
the terrorist organimtion Hamas
who were rightly thrown out of
Israel — the country they seek to
destroy along with all the Jews in
It.

Mr. Brittingham portrays these
400 murderers and terrorists as
“weary refugees who have no
place to call home.” We have a
news ﬂash for Mr. Brittingham:
Israel is not the “home” of these
or of any Arabs in the sense that
they simply do not and never
accept the fact that the Jews have
any right to the land of -Israel
(including, of course, those lands
that were liberated by the Jews
througharniracleofG-din1967
—Judea, Samaria and Gaza). To
the Arabs, Israel is only a de
facto ‘state which has no‘legitima-
cy—it«-is,,'nei°fect,abandit,rob-

berstatethatsitsonthenrinsof»
what was once “Palestine.” This

is why there will never ‘be any
kind of pennanent peace with
them.

The fact of the matter is that
whether these “weary refugees”
are allowed to ‘retum or not, this

wilhave no  on terrorist '
activities drrecte' d against Israel."

Such activity will continue and
escalate as -long as Israel remains
a sovereign Jewish State in the
midst of the Arab World.

We -do agree with 'Mr.
Brittirrgham on one point: Israel
should not be the recipient of
any economic aid, as this aid
inevitably becomes the wedge by
which Israel is forced to betray

her own national self-interest.
Surely those who appreciate
the principle of “Realpolitik“ will
understand why it is in Israels
longterm self-interest to expel
those who would destroy her.

Sarah Kaden CAS ‘91
Max Kaden CAS ‘()3

Mr. Srulevich, in his article of
Feb. 4, has made several mis-
takes in his depiction of Israel.

To begin with, Arabs living in

LETTERS

 

the occupied lands do not have
the right to vote. One would
think that a “democracy,” which
Israel claims to be, would allow
them a vote.

Mr. Srulevich states, “They
have the right to protest. I do not
see any chains on them.” No, the
Arabs are not in chains, but if
caught protesting, one of several
things could happen to them.
Their children could have their
bones systematically broken by
Israeli soldiers for something as

’minor as throwing a rock. Or

‘perhapsihci/;would get olf
and onlyhfave their -house ‘bull-

: by tlii: Israelis because a

‘family member was suspected" of
protesting the occupation. For
-the past few years, Arabs have
been denied an education
because they made the mistake
of exercising their right to
protest. ' ’

I will -concede to Mr. Smlevich
that Hamas is a radical terrorist
group which the world would ‘be
better off without. However, the

 400 deportees should be put on
trial not, exported. Of course this .

does not happen because there
isn’t enough evidence for a trial.
Like blacks in America, to be
bom an Arab in Israel is to be
born a suspect. Most importantly,

 

it should be noted that the brutal
tactics employed by Hamas were
learned from the Stern Gang and
former terrorists now in the
Israeli govemment. The only dif-
ference is that Israelis hold
power and the Arabs don't.
History is always kind to the win-
ner.

Trends in the job market are always changing, and
Pitt’s student Placement Service can tell you what areas
are up—and—coming.

Job trends are no longer found in the world of the
large corporation.

“It’s the end of an era of large corporations dictating
where students go,” said Bob Perkoski, director of the
Placement Service.

Trends of the ‘90s are in small to mid—size corpora-
tions, retail, the insurance and health care ﬁelds and
entrepreneurship. “Just in the last ﬁve years, retail has
come up,” Perkoski said. There is also a trend in career-
related experience, which can be found in an intern-
ship.

Perkoski said that there are three main reasons that
students go to the Placement Service: 1) to prepare all
necessary tools to get a job, like the résumé, 2) to get
expert advice on their approaches to getting jobs and 3)
to find out if there are any openings. Serving about
2,000 students and alumni per year, the Placement
Service holds job fairs as well as the many basic job
preparation services.

“We work with [students] on the tools, advice and
actually connecting students with opportunities,” said
Jane Denovchek of the Placement Service. “In its best
sense it is a partnership.”

Most of the job opportunities come from “on-campus
recruitment and employers with special needs right

job trends are always changing

now,” Perkoski said. “The Placement Service targets
building relationships with small to mid—size corpora-
tions.”

When contacting companies with openings,
Denovchek said she asks them, “We have talented peo-
ple, what are your needs?”

“Students who take the creative and ﬂexible approach
navigate well in a difﬁcult market. Students who have
the initial extracurriculars have an easier time [in their
job search].”

“We work with the individual to find what’s the best
strategy for your job market,” Denovchek said.
“Nobody looks for a job in the same way.”

“People are not being traditional — interview on
campus and stay with that company,” Perkoski said.
“People are being creative and flexible.”

There are hi-tech fairs for people in the science, busi-
ness and engineering fields and creative career semi-
nars for people in the advertising or writing ﬁelds.

The Placement Service also serves alumni. There is
also Alum-Net, “a group of alums who help other alums
and graduating seniors ﬁnd jobs and make contacts,”
Perkoski said.

The Placement Service conducts focus group discus-
sions to get student input on the jobs they got through
the service. This year, there will be an employer focus
group to get feedback from employers who fill posi-
tions with students through the Placement Service.

There is also a survey to get job information. Perkoski
said this is relevant because “we need to respond to
changes in the economy.”

Job seekers get

' The spring brings high anxiety to graduat-
ing Pitt seniors who have degrees, but not
jobs. During this time, job fairs and campus
recruiting help soon-to-be graduates open
the door to “the real world” by letting them
meet with potential employers.

The University of Pittsburgh Placement
Service sponsors job fairs and on-campus
recruiting events, as well as offers a variety
of other career-planning tools.

The Placement Service offers workshops
on constructing a résumé, a cover letter and
gameplan for a job search. It offers individ-
ual counseling and practice interviews.
There is also a VAX/VMS (E-Mail)_placement
network and an employer library that both
contain vital infomiation on companies and
employment trends.

Betsy has just spent the week-
end perfecting her résumé for an
office job. She is bright, has had a
lot of job experience and her
communication skills are unbe-
lievable.

Betsy scheduled her interview a
half an hour after her last class of
the morning. The class ran over
and she did not have a chance to
change her clothes. That did not
bother her, she was confident in
her resume and herself. So she
rushed to the interview in clean
jeans, a fuschia sweater, fuschia
socks and penny loafers.

The interview was fabulous.
Betsy was intelligent and articu-
late. The interviewer was
impressed with Betsy’s answers
but not with her appearance.
Another applicant got the job.
Mark was just as qualified as
Betsy, but he came dressed
accordingly.

Mark wore a navy blue two-
piece suit, white oxford, red and
blue striped tie, navy blue socks

s to intervi-e-iv attire -and ap

and brown wingtips.

Yes, job seekers, how you dress
for an interview can make or
break your chances of getting the
job. With the help of Kevin
Collins and Bonnie Yellin, place-
ment counselors at Pitt’s
Placement Service, a list was com-
piled of how to dress for the inter-
view.

First and foremost, dress
according to the type of job. If
you are to be interviewed for a
gas station position, don’t wear a
suit. The interviewer will assume
that you do not want to get your
hands dirty. If you are applying
for an office job, you need to
dress in business attire.

After you get the job will be the
time to show a little more of your
personality, but you want to dress
conservative for the interview.

Suits: When it comes to suits
for men, they should stick with
the basic colors —-— navy blue,
black, grey and khaki (depending
on the season). A white oxford is
the most conservative look for a
dress shirt. Solid or striped ties
should be worn — blues and reds

are most commonly suggested.
Save the paisleys, ﬂowered prints,
polka dots and Bugs Bunny for
an evening out on the town.

When it comes to suits for
women, also keep to the basic
colors, just like men. Women
have a little more leeway. The
skin can be either long or knee-
length. Do not wear anything
above the knee. An interview is
not the time to be provocative.
This also means that low—cut
blouses and low—cut camisoles
should not be worn. Blouses and
camisoles should be white or off-
white. Stay away from shiny mate-
rial.

The basic thing to remember is
to be conservative. In some cases,
an applicant may want to wear a
more trendy suit if applying for a
job in retail, but to be safe, check
with Pitt’s Placement Service for
good advice.

Shoes: Shoes are very impor-
tant. That is one thing that inter-
viewers notice. For both men and

@‘.§‘.;
pearance

women, shoes sh()uld be pol-
ished, shined and well—heeled. Do
not go into an interview with
scuffed shoes. For men, shoes
should match the suit. Black and
brown wingtips or penny loafers
are preferable. Women can match
their shoes exactly with the suit.
Pumps are most professional. If
you cannot walk in high heels,
then ﬂats will work. Do not wear
spiked heels. Once again, this is
not the time for being provoca-
tive.

Socks: Men should wear dark
socks. Do not wear white, they
stand out too much. Also, make
sure that the socks are not slouch-
ing around the ankles.

Pantyhose: Never wear panty-
hose darker than your shoes.
Usually it is good to stick with
nude hose. But if you are wearing
light shoes, do not wear dark
hose. Also, do not wear panty-
hose that sag and cause you to
keep pulling them up.

Résumés can be easy With help

Résumé — the very word
sends chills up the spines of
many students. The thought
of sitting down with a blank
piece of paper and produc-
ing a document that will (for
better or worse) significantly
affect your chances for
employment is an intimidat-
ing prospect for a lot of us.

But don’t despair. A good
résumé can be written by

anyone who applies a little
forethought and a lot of com-
mon sense to the task. Let’s
start with the forethought
issue. Keep in mind that the
résumé’s purpose is to/inter-
est employers in your qualifi-
cations enough to call you
for an interview. Also consid-
er that most recruiters only
spend about 30 seconds or
so reviewing a résumé. So

your resume has to commu-
nicate your qualifications to
an employer quickly and
effectively.

The best way to start writ-
ing your résumé is to jot
down everything that you’ve
been doing over the past few
years in school, in extracur-
ricular activities, in part-time
and summer jobs and in any
other area that you feel is
important. Now go back over
what you’ve written. Out of
all the items on your list,
which ones stand out as solid
accomplishments? You may
have maintained a high GPA,
you have had one or two rel-
evant work experiences or
held leadership positions in
school organizations. Write
these type of accomplish-
ments down on a separate
sheet of paper. ’

Go back over your original
list. Can you spot overall
themes that run across differ-
ent items? For example, did
you demonstrate strong orga-
nizational skills in your job
as well as your fraternity? Or
perhaps you’ve always done

solely in charge of something
or you’re a quick learner. Jot
these themes down along
with your accomplishments.

Making
your first
impression

By Christine Birch
Graphics Editor

Congratulations!
You’ve made it this far,
— your resume was
impressive. Now comes
the interview.

Not only is this the
most important part,
because this is the one-
shot-go-for—broke
chance to meet the
boss, — it is also the
scariest part.

There is something
about actually meeting
the person who will
decide your life and the
satisfaction of your
creditors. It can make
even the most seasoned
people-person break
out in a cold sweat.

However, there are
some things you can do
to keep stress to a min-
imum and at least give
the illusion of calm-
ness. Maybe you will
even fool yourself.

First off, make sure
you know exactly
where the interview is,
leave early enough to
allow for delays.
Tardiness for an inter-
view is inexcusable. If
you cannot make it on
time for the all-too-.cru-
cial interview, how will
you make it to work on

time daily?
By getting there
early, you will also

have time to collect
yourself and prepare
for the interview.

As you walk in,
smile, introduce your-
self and give a firm
handshake. This will
show confidence and
honesty.

When the interviewer
invites you to sit down,
sit. Let the interviewer
make the first calls, do
not start the interview
yourself.

Once the interview
begins, make good eye
contact. This is impor-
tant. This shows the
interviewer that you are
interested and you are
not nervous.

During the questions
and answers part of the
interview, avoid using
yes and no answers.
Explain yourself in full.

Some questions may
throw you for a loop,
but breathe and take a
moment and you will
do fine.

Some tough questions
that may be asked of
you are:

Tell me a little
about yourself.

You must be pre-
pared to answer this
question at length. Use

don’t be afraid

It is this sense of hopelessness that
creates stress and anxiety in so
many people, and this anxiety, if
allowed to become overwhelm-
ing, can greatly interfere with the
job search process.

The best antidote to this kind of
stress is personal initiative.
Psychologists have known for a
long time that the most signiﬁcant
growth in individuals occurs when
they overcome a stressful and/or
challenging situation. Those of
you who approach the job search
process energetically and creative-
ly will learn new skills and discov-
er new aspects of yourselves that
will serve you well for a lifetime.

To conduct an effective job
search, be prepared to do the
research necessary to stay on top
of emerging job trends.
Networking is an overused word
but an undenitilized technique in

overqualified
for if it’s in a field where you
eventually hope to prosper. Most
importantly, don’t forget to make
good use of the experts on job
search strategies who work at
your Placement Service (223
W'ﬂliam Pitt Union).

While you are engaged in your
job search it is also important to
reduce your personal stress level.
Take care of yourself physically,
maintain a sense of humor and
develop an image of yourself as a
resilient person who can handle
the temporary disappointments of
life and remain upbeat.

Albert Camus once wrote, “In
the midst of Winter, I finally
learned that there was in me, an
invincible Summer.” Find this
invincible part of you and face the
challenge ahead with courage,
good humor and intelligence.
Good Luck!

Hair and Nails: Men, make sure that your hair is neat and trim
and that you are clean—shaven. Men should get their hair cut
before the interview. If the hair is longer than the nape of the

you have long hair you might want to pull it back so it won’t be

use of career planning tools
offered by the Placement
Service, job seekers should
remember to keep a positive
attitude.

Hundreds of students go to
the Pittsburgh area job fairs,
and Kinney said graduating
seniors should make an effort
to attend them. “It’s great
practice, believe me, to be
among your competition,” she
said.

Kinney said one graduate
who was offered an elemen-
tary school position at a job
fair told her, “You have to go
in there like you are the only
person for that job.”

In addition to having a posi-
tive attitude, Kinney stressed
that candidates must learn to
deal with rejection after inter-
views with potential employ-
ers.

“It is part of the process,”
she said, “and it only takes
one yes to make up for all
lthe nosl.”

Bonnie Yellin, Placement
counselor at Pitt and coordina-
tor for the University of
Pittsburgh's participation in
Western Pennsylvania Career
Services Association
(WestPACS) Job Fair on March
3, said that for graduating
seniors 21 job fair should be

mulation of credits, it should

experiences where you devel-
oped skills that make you
more marketable," Yellin said.
‘'Don’t wait until your senior
year to do this.”

Yellin said employers value
people who take initiative,
achieve results and interact
well with others, and they
look for these skills on poten-
tial employees’ résumés.

“Over all, the resume is a
critical element. You need to
be working on your resume
from the freshman year, look-
ing for opportunities to devel-
op skills through internships,
campus activities and public
speaking,” Yellin said.

Yellin explained that deci-
sion-making, interpersonal
and analytical skills are among
the most important, and she
also said it is never too early
to start developing these skills.

“The earlier you start, the
more confident and sophisti-
cated your overall presenta-
tion will become,” Yellin said.

She added, “That increased
level of sophistication leads to
confidence, which in turn
increases your chances of
making a favorable impression
on an employer."

tion about that field, such as:
what the demand is like, what
preparation is needed and
what steps students should
take to get there. But where
should students go who have
not decided on a career direc-
tion?

Kinney said there is a three-
step process. “In terms of
career exploration and finding
a career that interests them,
they can start at Pitt’s Career
Counseling Center. It has a
more broad-based function.”

She said the Counseling
Center on the third floor of
the William Pitt Union gives
aptitude tests and conducts
personal interviews in order to
draw students out of the ranks
of the “clueless.“

Once students have their
“clue," Kinney said, “I encour-
age them to explore the vari-
ous options out there and talk
to people in the field they're
interested in."

She recommended that stu-
dents ask people working in
the field questions about their
jobs: Do they enjoy it? What
do they do each day? How did
they get to where they are?

Kinney said the third step in
entering a job field is to con-
tact the Placement Service and
to take advantage of the ser-
vices it offers.

“If you don‘t have a job
after graduation. come back
and we'll start again. Take
advantage of the Placement
Center as alumni.”

ond sheet of paper as well.

When you’re done review-
ing your original list several
times you should be left with
at least a partial inventory of
your strengths — or “selling
points” — as a job candidate.
These are the items that
you'll need to highlight on
your résumé.

How you go about present-
ing your selling points on
paper is very important.
There are three major areas
to consider when you begin
working on your résumé’s
first draft (believe me when I
tell you that it'll take more
than one draft). The format
of your resume is your first
decision. The placing of main
headings, the layout of your
text and the sequence in
which items are listed are all
examples of formatting.
While in many cases formats
are a matter of your personal
preference, it is important to
remember that the way in
which information is present-

this to point out things
unique about yourself.

What do you expect for a
starting salary?

Downplay the importance
of a specific salary. It would
be bad judgement to state a
salary preference before you
know the range of the
prospective employer.

What is your weakest
point?

The answer to this ques-
tion should be a strength dis-
guised as a weakness, like
being a perfectionist or get-
ting too involved with work.

The important thing to
keep in mind when answer-
ing questions like these is to
think from the perspective of
the employer. You want to
always present yourself in a
positive light, as a hard-
working and ambitious (but
not too ambitious) employee.

Do not criticize former
employers or places of
employment. That is not tact-
ful.

If asked about salary
expectations, state what you
have learned from research.
If the salary offer is lower
than you wanted, be honest
and speak out if interested or
not.

At the end of the interview,
if you have not been given a
definite answer about the job
or when you will hear from
the interviewer, ask when it
would be possible for you to
call and find out.

Thank the interviewer for
considering you for the job
and taking the time out for
the interview. Before you
leave, once again firmly
shake the interviewer's hand.

Program for two years.

ed on your résumé can have
a big impact on its message
to employers.

Some formats, for example,
emphasize dates and length
of employment. This may or
may not be desirable for
your particular background.
Also, some candidates’
résumés should list activities
before work experience, if
activities are a more mar-
ketable component of their
background. For fogmat ques-
tions, your best bet is to
check with the Placement
Service.

Content is your next step.
Since employers take less
than a minute to look over
your resume, your challenge
is to keep them interested as
long’ as possible. Begin by
emphasizing responsibilities
— not duties — when
describing your experiences
and activities. You may want
to write that you “waited on
customers" in your summer
job, but look beyond the job
description —how did your

. tasks

fit in with the overall
operation of the business,
and what other skills did you
use (customer service, work-
ing under pressure, resolving
complaints)?

When writing your résumé
forget everything you learned
in grade school about proper
sentence construction. You
need to describe your experi-
ences in a “catchy” way that
will grab the reader’s atten-
tion. Begin phrases on your
resume with action verbs (i.e.
managed, coordinated, orga-
nized), and provide some
details —how many people
did you supervise or how
much money were you
responsible for as club trea-
surer? Finally, omit anything
on your résumé that's not rel-
evant to your qualifications.
Listing things like age, height
and weight or marital status
only wastes valuable space.

After you’ve taken care of
format and content, you'll
need to ensure your résumé’s

Think of an assignment that weighs heavily on your mind right now—say, a term paper. With Macintosh, you can bring

outline, change the order of topics, and jot down related ideas at will.

Then you start to write. You don’t like the way you phrased a paragraph? No problem—try something new, without
erasing or retyping a word. Want to move the second page of your first draft to the tail end of your last draft? It only
takes a few seconds.

With Macintosh, you can also have your paper proofread in a minute or two. And you can illustrate it with professional-

And here’s the clincher: You can learn to do all of these things—all of them———in less time than you might spend

Panthers look to knock off reeling Pirates again

By Tom Schneider

Visions of the age-old fable
of I)avid and Goliath roamed
through the Fitzgerald Field
House on Jan. 16 when Pitt
played host to Big East beast
Seton Hall.

In that game, the Panthers
upset the then seventh-ranked
Pirates on first-year player
Garrick Thomas’ three-pointer
with five seconds remaining in
the game. The loss was the
‘Hall’s first in Big East play
and only its second of the sea-
son.

was picked by nearly every
sportswriter in the country to
run away with the Big East
finds itself mired in fourth
place behind Boston College,
St. _Iohn’s and Pitt.

P._]. Carlesimo’s Pirates will
be thrilled to return to the
Meadowlands tonight for their
second matchup of the season
against Pitt. In 12 games there
this season, the Pirates have
saber-slashed their way to an
11-1 record, their only loss
coming to then third-ranked
North Carolina.

“We’ve been struggling late-

“We. have a nice stretch coin-
ing up, with a few home
games  There’s still eight
games left before the Big East
Tournament, so we’re not
worried about anything just
yet.”

The Panthers are coming off
an important 71-69 win on
Saturday over Big East co-
leader St. John’s at the Field
House. It came after consecu-
tive losses to Syracuse and
Villanova at the Civic Arena.

Seton Hall is mulling over its

seniors and six first-year stu-
dents on the team? Would it

Reality ofcracle is real tragedy in case of indicted football players

In the mid 1980s under for-
mer head football coach Barry
Switzer, the University of
Oklahoma had its trouble with
athletes who indeed did not
leave the ghetto at home.

Charles Thompson, a former
quarterback at the University of
Oklahoma, said, “Just because
a coach comes into the ghetto,
makes me wear a new suit and
puts me on his campus doesn’t
mean the ghetto did not come
with me.”

“I recruit only the best play-
ers in the country to come
here,” Switzer said. “They are
also the same players that
Miami and Notre Dame recruit.”

It seems almost impossible to
determine what athlete will or
will not be a law-abiding stu-
dent athlete.

Last week. two current and
one former Pitt football player

failed the law-abiding student
athlete test.

Reuben Brown, Jermaine
Williams and Derrick Hicks
were arrested and charged with
allegedly possessing crack with
the intent to distribute. Their
trial begins Wednesday.

A Pitt football player who
asked that his name be with-

held said, “Some members on

the team knew that they were
doing that since July. It was
only a matter of time before
they got caught.”

Other players said that
Reuben would have been a
millionaire in two years and
that was really stupid.

Brown is a very gifted athlete
with incredible potential. He
has all the tools necessary to be
a first—round draft choice.
Brown surely would be consid-
ered one of the elite offensive-

line prospects in the country

Brown was one of the most
highly recruited defensive line-
men in the country coming out
of E.C. Glass High School in
Lynchburg, Va. He was voted
the most valuable defensive
linemen in Virginia and earned
both All—State and All-American
honors. Brown was also a

American.

When a player is on an ath-
letic scholarship, the only

i expense that is not covered is

his laundry bill.

Were these players greedy,
stupid or both?

Maybe Brown wanted to be
like Nino Brown from the hit
movie New jack City. And
Williams and Hicks wanted to
be the East Liberty version of
the “cash money brothers.”

Former Ohio State All-
American Chris Carter, who is
now with the Minnesota
Vikings, was kicked off the
squad for taking money from
an agent while still an under-
grad.

“I needed money because I
could not even take my girl-
friend out on the weekends,”
Carter said.

If she really liked Carter, then
another year of staying home
on the weekends wouldn’t
have mattered.

prepares for
spring season

Asst. News Editor

The ball is dropped into a
circle of players and there is
chaos.

Growling players locked
together kick and shove try-
ing to knock the ball loose
from the jumble of legs. Then
somehow the ball is freed
from the circle, and the play-
er who comes up with it is
buried beneath a barrage of
bodies.

The game is fast-paced and
the rules are confusing.

It is rugby, a sport that not
many people, including
beginning players, under-
stand.

The Panther Rugby Football
Club is currently preparing
for the second half of its sea-
son, which will begin March 6
against Carnegie Mellon
University. The club is now in
the middle of the biggest
recruiting drive since the
team reappeared four years
ago. Coach Tom Miller said
that many prospective players
show up misinformed on the
sport.

“A lot of people arrive at

the recruiting meeting with a
very stereotypical view of the
game  that it is chaos, that
it is mayhem a crazy
game,” Miller said.

“We try to get people away
from that thinking. It’s a game
that is very demanding,” he
added.

Captain Brian Stevenson
agrees that many of the new
players will start from scratch,
learning everything from how
to catch the ball to the rules
of the match.

“Everything is taught on the
practice field,” Stevenson
said. “It’s not a game like
football where you can learn
everything from jock talk.
You have to get in the game
and play. You don’t really
know a rule until you’ve been
called for it about three times.

it behind them and picked
it up on vault.

On vault the team tallied
a score of 45.0().

This total is represented
by the efforts of Jorgensen
(8.8), Myers (8.8), Kristin
Brown (9.1), Christine
Battista (9.15) and Friend
(9.15).

The judges’ scoring did
not support him, but Rovee
said he believed some of
the gymnasts did the best
vaults he had ever seen
them do.

The team came to life on
floor, where it recorded a
score of 46.75. Top scores
were performed by
Jorgensen (9.45), Bethany
Toellner (9.2), Kristin
Brown (9.65), Friend (9.35)
and a season high for
Battista (9.1).

Pitt finished the meet on
beam with a convincing
46.15. Good scores were
provided by Deena Daller
(9.1) and Myers (9.()5).

Toellner tied her season
high with a 9.15, Kristin
Brown completed her
strong all-around perfor-
mance with a season high
9.5 and Friend finished
with a career high 9.35.

The final scoring has Pitt
losing, 185.65 to 183.15,
but like all gymnastics
meets the score does not
determine the success of
the team.

In gymnastics your
win/loss record is virtually
meaningless. How high the
scores are in those wins
and losses is more signifi-
cant.

The top seven teams
qualify for regionals (play-
offs) in gymnastics.

A team takes its top six
scores, with at least two of
those being home meets
and two being away meets,
averages out the middle
four scores and that is its
qualifying score. Presently
Pitt’s record is 1-6, but its
scores are high enough to

place the team eighth in its
region.

Last year Pitt just missed
regionals by a mere .6 of a
point. That was with a
team hampered by injuries.

“Usually at this point in
the season I am pulling
girls out of the lineup, but
this year I am putting peo-
ple back into the lineup,”
Rovee said. “I am happy
with the scores because
considering what we have
accomplished despite the
injuries, once we are back
to full strength on all
events, our scores can only
escalate.”

Having 12 gymnasts
able to compete instead of
eight will increase the
competition among team
members.

It will make the team
better and it will help to
take off some of the pres-
sure. That could prove to
be the difference between
last year’s failures and this
year’s success.

Then you‘ll know better."

Rugby has only recently
resurfaced at Pitt. After a
shaky first season, the team
has become a force in inter-
collegiate play. Last season
the Panthers went 10-1,
which lead Miller to take
them up to a higher level of
competition.

after it played against strong

opponents such as Penn
State, Slippery Rock and
Indiana University of

Pennsylvania. In two of those
games, defeat came in the
final minutes.

“The team gets a lot more
out of playing tougher teams
than by winning by 5()
points," Miller said. “We're a
much better rugby team, a
much stronger team."

Stevenson called last semes-
ter a tough break.

“It was basically a young
team,” Stevenson said. “We
had guys in key positions
who weren‘t experienced at
all. We always lose guys,
too.”

The team’s spring schedule
includes several regional
opponents and a Spring
Break trip to North Carolina
to face North Carolina State.

at the Mobile Invitational at

Sunday.

“The 4 x 800 improved
their time by seven seconds
at the Mobile Invitational,”
Lewis said. “I think they can
definitely challenge for one
of the top three spots in the

Big East.”
Both the Hardee’s
and Mobile Invitationals

were nonscoring, but the
Panthers made the better
impression at the Hardee’s
Invitational.

Pitt finished eight individu-
als and relay teams in the
top four of the team’s events
against competition from
Maryland, William and Mary
and West Virginia.

Pitt’s Staci Suggs took a
first place in 55-meter hur-
dles, followed closely by
teammate Katina Miles, who
placed third.

They also ran as a the
middle legs of the shuttle
hurdle relay which finished
on top.

The relay also featured
Fletcher on the first leg and
Lakeya Smith as anchor.

Renee Pope contributed to
the effort by running to a
fourth place finish in the 55-
meter dash as well as a
fourth place in the 200-meter
run.

In the field events, Joanne
Warner gave Pitt a lift with a
first place in the shot-put.

Warner threw almost eight
feet past the second—place
finisher from Youngstown
State. Miles placed fourth in
the event.

According to Lewis, the
women's indoor track team
is prepared for the Big East
Championships in Boston on
Feb. 21.

“Most of our problems are
worked out,” Lewis said.
“The way we are running
now is pretty much the same

to fine tune their skills

will be at the Husker

“There is pressure, but I
put it on myself to do good
because I know I can be
successful and I know I want
to,” I.ewandowski said.

Lewandowski's ability to
focus has helped her main-
tain a composure in competi-
tion, but in practice she has
been known to have difficul-
ties. The frustration of a pre-

cision sport like diving,
where concentration is the
key to success and the inner

drive to compete, sometimes
drives Lewandowski to the
edge.

"If I'm standing on
the board and the
on, and I‘m not going with
the rhythm or I don’t sing
the verse before I go, I just
cant do it," Lewandowski
said.

This quirky lack of concen-
tration catches the eyes of
the coach and the other
divers, but her distractions
are all part of her competi-
tive nature.

“It is hard to concentrate
on diving when y()u have a
lot of school work. and it’s
hard to do school work
when you’re thinking about
diving,” Lewandowski said.

Adjustments to being a
first-year student athlete
aside, Lewandowski has
proved to be a valuable cata-
lyst to the entire diving pro-

radio is

gram.

“I believe that Sunday‘s
presence has brought the tal—
ent and abilities of the other
divers up,” Krug said.

Even sophomore teammate
Kara Sixbury, who is often
neck and neck in practice as
well as meets with her first-
year counterpart, under-
stands the true contributions
of Lewandowski’s success on
a team level.

“I think it’s good for me
personally to have Sunday
on the team, because even
though we are teammates we
compete against each other
in a way because we push
each other to get better,“
Sixbury said.

With both her coach and
her teammates harping on
her competitive
Lewandowski says she can-
not figure out why she loses
her concentration at times.

“If I want to do good I
can, but if there is just the
tiniest thing blocking that, I
just can’t do anything,”
Lewandowski said, adding
that school is her number-
one priority.

Lewandowski has been
good -—- very good in her
brief career. She has already
made an attack on the
record books when she set
the 3—meter spring board
record at the Pitt Invitational
earlier this year.

This three-point shot was one of the three Garrick Thomas hit in addition to his game-win-
net in Pitt's ﬂrst meeting with Seton Hall this season.

attempts against the Redmen.
Ice’s travails have translated
into horrendous outside shoot-

ing — the Panthers have made
only 11 of their last 55
attempts from three-point

“lMcCulloughl is a very
strong player, and he’s just
having a tough stretch where
he is having trouble scoring
points,” Seton Hall assistant
coach Bruce Hamburger said.
“He distributes the ball well
and plays very good defense
 he can pressure you and
make your guys miss opportu-
nities.”

Without McCullough’s scor-
ing touch, Pitt Coach Paul
Evans has stressed the inside
game as well as an improving
Panther defense, which had
been rated as the worst in the
Big East.

In addition, Evans is using
the depth of this Panther team
to his full advantage, as was
demonstrated on Saturday
when five Panthers reached
double figures in scoring.

“lPittl has excellent depth,"
Hamburger said. “You can go
to any position and find some-
one who can play well
Gant can pick up for McNeal
or Mobley inside  and Brush
has hurt us every time he’s
played  they have 1() solid
players who can pick it up at
any time.”

The only thing the Panthers
have to look forward to facing
is an All—American guard, an
Olympic bronze medalist and
a gargantuan in the paint.

Pirate guard Terry Dehere is
trying to live up to the status
of preseason All—American. He
is currently averaging 21.1

McNeal killed us on the boards.”

Pitt forward Chris McNeal fired in 22 points 

points per game and 2.4 assists per game.
He was the top scorer when these teams last
ine.t, with 25 points. The matchup between
Dehere and Pitt’s Ahmad Shareef, who’s offensive
production has picked up while McCullough’s
has droppe.d off, should be a key to the outcome
of the game.
“Shareef is playing extremely well right now,” __
Hamburger said. “He’s playing a lot more than he
He’s one of those guys with
good experience that hasn’t been doing much
offensively, bttt now he’s back into form.”
Seton Hall forward Arturas Karnishovas, a 
member of the 1992 Lithuanian National team,
will be another deadly sharpshooter that the
Panthers will have to control.
Karnishovas scored 15 points against Pitt at the 
Field House, to go along with 10 rebounds. .
Luther Wright, Seton Hall’s behemoth center,
will be looking to avenge his poor performance
in the last game against Pitt.
He played that game despite a concussion suf-
fered a few days before during a Pirate practice.
Wright was abused by Panther big men Chris .
McNeal and Eric Mobley all night, while being '
held scoreless. I
“Luther’s feeling much better now, and he’s
playing well,” Hamburger said. ‘‘In that last game, :
we couldn’t guard inside or rebound well
