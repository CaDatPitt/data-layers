University celebrating its bicentennial

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

he university issued a warning to its students that ”no

student shall be permitted to wear a dirk, or to carry any

deadly weapon.” Any dueling or promotion thereof will
be ”punished, in all cases, by expulsion.”

Actually, this was a warning given to students who in 1822
attended the Western University of Pennsylvania, which has since
become the University of Pittsburgh. This is somewhat different from
the warnings about add-drop deadlines and alcohol policy that Pitt

students receive today.

Throughout the history of the university there have been immense
changes, bringing about both accomplishments and setbacks.

In 1849, fire destroyed all of the university buildings. Everything
was put back in place well before 1936, when ﬂoods affected both
students and faculty members. Chancellor Edward H. Litchfield
resigned in 1965 when the university was nearly bankrupt. Pitt's
athletic program also had many rough years, such as 1971, when-
the university contemplated dropping the football program due to
declines in attendance and revenue.

Yet there were those people who believed in Pitt, believing it could

become an institution where people could expand their knowledge
and fulﬁll their dreams. It is because of their efforts that Pitt has
overcome its shortcomings to become a world-class university.

Vvith a collective feeling of history and pride, Pitt celebrates its
200th birthday. The university's bicentennial commission has selected
three weeks of the upcoming year to present special events
celebrating the past, present and future.

"I certainly believe the celebration will give evidence to the
general public and to those interested in higher education that the
University of Pittsburgh has been around for a long time doing ’

IFC ruling forces new rush policy

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

Most people have a certain image
of college fraternity rush parties -
Animal House. Groups of people
swaying their arms and hips to music.
Tubs of beer sloshed on the floor. A
meeting ground for individuals intent
on having fun.

On the other hand, the image most
people have of a dry rush party 
well, that’s just it. There haven’t been
many movies made about fraternities

that get together for a night of
volleyball. Nevertheless, dry rush will
be in effect this year at Pitt.

”I personally hate the idea," said
Delta Sigma Phi brother Matt Dern.
"but I have no choice.”

Phi Delta Theta brother Jeff Flash
had a similar attitude. ”I don’t really
care for the idea but it has to be done.
As a fraternity we voted against it, but

. in general I think the |FC‘[|nterfrater-
nity Council] voted for it. I guess they
just felt that that's how it was going
to be.”

According to the IFC rush chair-
man, Mark Medica, the idea for dry
rush was first brought up in an IFC
meeting. ”Everyone for the most part
first opposed the idea,” said Medica,
”but now it's been accepted. It will

LETTER POLICY

The Pitt News encourages its readers to
write letters. Letters intended for publica-
tion must be typed and must contain the
author's name, university affiliation and
telephone number. Letters can be mailed
or personally delivered to 441 William Pitt
Union, University of Pittsburgh, Pitt-

sburgh, PA 15260. The Pitt News reserves '

 
   
 
  

be a good change and we're going
to make the most of it.”

Mike Trexler, a Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon brother and a recent Pitt
graduate, said that he thinks the idea
of a dry rush is dumb. ”People can
see the point of it so they're for it. But
it adds to the distaste of the feeling
by the fraternities that the university
has too much control over them,”
said Trexler.

This was one of the reasons voiced
by many brothers for initially oppos-
ing dry rush. This reason, as well as
others, does not hold up very well
with former student activities direc-
tor Andy Smith.

”lt’s plain to understand that what
the frats were doing was against the
law," said Smith, since departed for
Texas. ”The whole thing goes back
several years ago. The university was
taking a look at alcohol consumption
on the campus, deciding on several
new policies. One of them said that
the fraternities and the sororities had
to obey the laws of Pennsylvania,
which specifically say that there can
be no alcohol consumption under the
age of 21.

”At this time, {three years ago], we
decided to initiate some form of dry
rush, planning to work up to a full dry
rush. My office felt that we needed
to have a consistent [guideline] for
it,” said Smith. ”Around the first

ALL YOU NEED

week in January of this year I met
with the IFC and told them that there
would be a dry rush in the fall. I ask-
ed them to design it and then to sub-
mit it to us but they refused."

This accounts for the fraternities
having little or no input into this
year's rush guidelines that were
made. Besides the lack of alcohol this
year, other common fraternity prac-
tices will be missing.

”We’re not allowed to have strip-
pers or adult movies this year," said
Pete Yergel, Pi Lambda Phi brother.
”They didn't even want us to have
our hot legs competition. Andy Smith
went to the IFC, Ito design a dry
rush]” said Yergel. ”He could have
contacted the individual fraternities."

One of the problems associated
with this year’s dry rush seems to
have been the lack of communication
between the IFC, the various frater-
nities and the student activities office.

”We tried to provide positive and
negative aspects on how to have a
dry rush,” said Smith, ”but at the time
the president of the IFC [now
graduated] wished to continue to
argue with us about the decision. I
think it was a poor choice on his part
and on others in the IFC."

Welcome (back)
to college, kids

Fall 1986 has arrived, and with it new students, friendships and
experiences. Welcome to college. For" most of you, welcome back

- to college. "lt's gonna be a great year, Gilbert. It sure is, Louis.” For
those of you who didn't see the movie, those are lines from Revenge

of the Nerds. In that movie, as in real campus life, the students go
through good and bad times. They fail and they succeed. Everyone
does.

Welcome seniors. This is your last year. You've mastered the
system. You know how to get your grades with minimal study time.
Some of you don't have to worry about getting carded in bars. You
know better than to eat in the Towers. Enjoy your final year of vaca-
tion. It will pass quickly. Then  gulp  the big step into the real
world and  a real job  and  worst of all  real responsibility.
There are only two answers to this predicament — wake up and face
the music or hide in school for a few more years and get your master's.

Welcome juniors. This is a tough year for you. You're probably
doing your toughest studying this year, so you won't have any serious
classes in your senior year. You will also be doing your toughest par-
tying this year. You know the saying, "You have to play hard to work
hard,” or something like that. You've grown accustomed to life at
Pitt. You're learning new short cuts everyday. Good luck.

Welcome sophomores. Isn't it great not to be freshmen? Congratula-
tions. You've made it through what could be the most mentally tax-
ing year of your lives. You can now walk around without looking
at everything. You can now give directions to someone who asks.
You can be normal people. The hard part about this year for you is
deciding in what exotic subject you will major. There certainly aren't
enough palm tree root specialists in the world — not that you can
get such a degree from Pitt. But you just may end up being one with
any degree you receive from Pitt. Oh, yeah, have fun trying to get
into bars.

Welcome freshmen. You're probably sick of hearing that. isn't col-
lege neato? No parents, no curfew, no dress code. As Pinto said,
"We’re college students, we can do anything we want!" Well, we
certainly can. All your hopes and dreams of higher education are
about to be fulfilled and shattered at the same time. And that, my
friends, is the joy of being a freshman —— a discovery every day. Most
will say of freshman year that it truly is a tough adjustment. No more
magic laundry service, no more home-cooked meals, no more
peaceful surroundings. But remember, you can never be an up-
perclassman without being a freshman first. The best thing to do is
accept that you are a freshman and will make all the mistakes that
freshmen make. Once you do this, half the battle is won. Try many
new things. Have fun. College isn't a place where people learn from
books; they learn from experience. Don't repeat that to your parents.
Speaking of them, don't feel stupid if you get homesick. Everyone
does. Just remember that the entire student body is behind you —
laughing, of course.

If you've made it this far down the column, you may as well know
what you're reading. This column is called the SNED. Only a few.
know why it's called that. It expresses the opinion of a majority of
the editorial staff of The Pitt News. It is the perspective editor's job
to do this.

It is important to know that you too can be part of this page. If you
feel strongly about some topic, write a letter to the editor. This is your
newspaper. Use it. Where else can you get your name in the paper
without being an All-America athlete?

Writing a letter to the editor is pretty easy, but there are a few rules.
First, use good English. If you don't, no matter how well you support
your argument, your credibility is shot. That's point No. 2. Support
your arguments, research your topic, understand before you write.
The third point is the most important. You don't have to disagree with
an argument to write a letter to the editor. If you agree strongly with
someone, let him or her know. Suggest a way to improve an already
strong idea.

Sad news from Graceland:
Dog and horse follow Elvis

I subscribe to many periodicals,
but my current favorite is
something called the Graceland
Express.

The Graceland Express is — as
it says on its front page —— the "of—

ficial news publication of
Graceland.” Graceland, of
course, was the home of the late
Elvis Presley.

Now, you might think that it
would be difficult finding enough
news to publish a regular paper
about the doings at a dead rock
star's former house, but the
Graceland Express is chock-full of
items every issue. The new edi-
tion just arrived in my mailbox —
and sure enough there is break-
ing news in it.

Just about everyone knows that
this month marks the ninth an-
niversary of Presley's death. But
only readers of the Graceland Ex-
press understand that this has

been a true season of renewed
mourning. at Graceland — two of
Elvis’ favorite animals passed
away within days of each other.
So while fans make their annual
August pilgrimage to Graceland
to grieve for Elvis, the real Elvis
insiders are grieving for Edmond
the dog and Rising Sun the horse.

The Graceland Express reports
that Edmond the dog — a
”beautiful honey-colored

Pomeranian" —- was added to the '

Presley household by Elvis just
before the singer died.

"Elvis was widely known for
his love of animals," the paper re-
counts. "Dogs, horses, monkeys,
chimpanzees, peacocks, mules,
you name it —- all have had a
home at Graceland at one time or
another, and most of them seem-
ed to think just as much of Elvis

like Elvis and that he didn't like
to run upstairs many days and
greet Elvis as he awoke. He did.
However, out of the people
around Graceland at the time —
Elvis, his father, his aunts, uncles,
cousins, friend, housekeepers,
employees — Edmond’s heart
belonged to only one person; and
that was Elvis’ Aunt Delta, who
had moved to Graceland at Elvis’
invitation back in 1967. It was
obvious to everyone where Ed-
mond’s affections lay, so Elvis
very soon made a gift of Edmond
to his aunt.

"Through the years Miss Delta
grew to think of Edmond as more
than a pet, particularly after los-
ing Elvis, her brother Vernon
(Elvis’ fatherland her mother. Ed-
mond, as she says, became her
’best friend.’ "

But as presstime approached
for the current edition of the
Graceland Express, Edmond the
dog breathed his last. The Express
ran a news story of the event
under the headline, "Farewell,
Little Friend.”

You'd think that would be
enough bad news. In an effort to
lighten things up, the editors of
the Graceland Express commis-
sioned an "exclusive interview”
with Rising Sun, Elvis’ favorite
horse, on the occasion of Rising
Sun's 25th birthday.

The interview was done in
whimsical question—and-answer
form, with the golden palomino
quarter horse '_’talking” toythe

reporter ‘i n l the manner‘   -
A typical statement by Rising Sun:-

"We|l [blushing], you see, I
was already a gelding when Elvis
asked me to move here in 1967.
Needless to say, my personal life
wasn't all that great at the time,
and ontop of that, my registered
name was ’Midget's Vandy.' I
had a goofy name and a boring
life. Elvis changed all of that."

The Graceland ‘Express gave
the interview with Rising Sun a
nice layout, complete with two
photographs of Elvis riding the
horse. Then, just as the presses
were about to roll, something
terrible happened: Rising Sun,
like Edmond the dog before him,
died. ‘

The Graceland Express handl-
ed this by printing a sidebar
under_ the headline, ”Special
Note." In the sidebar, the editors
announced the death of Rising
Sun, but said that the decision

Edmond’s heart

person; and that was

had been made to run the adja-
cent interview with the horse just
the way it had been written.
”After several discussions
among the staff,” the article said,
”along with a phone call to
several fans, we decided to run
the article as originally planned.
Everyone agreed that a
humorous, lighthearted article
like 'Star of the Pasture’ was in-
deed a most appropriate feature
to do, even now. After all, that is
what Rising Sun was all about —
warmth, fun, laughter and some
very special memories of a hap-
py time in Elvis Presley's life.
"Rising Sun was buried in the
Graceland pasture. He lies facing
the East — toward the rising sun.”

 Why is husband talking in his

0!‘-

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, August 29, I986

Q: Lately my husband has been
talking in his sleep, saying, "Joni, I
love you.” Joni is one of his
customers. He says nothing is going
on there. Is he lying, or could this just
be a fantasy?

A: It could be either, and common
sense will decide which to believe.
Supposing that his behavior while he
is awake is reassuring — no staying
out when he used to be in, no disap-
pearances long enough for phone
calls from a pay phone, nothing like
lipstick on his clothes — then I
wouldn't worry. And don't hold him
responsible for what goes on in his
sleep.

Don't pry into his dreams, or he'll
be afraid to go to sleep for fear of say-
ing, "Joni, Joni," (or maybe "Fred,
Fred”). Sleep deprivation is a well-
known torture. You could drive him
crazy. If he acts OK when he is
awake, let him have whatever comes
his way in his dreams. And consider
this: the more sexual energy that goes
into making love with you, the less
he has for amorous dreams.

How to
be good  
freshmen

Wow, look at all of you freshmen!
Yeah, that's right, lowly freshmen.
How can I tell? Well, it's like this. The
campus maps and Orientation name
tags are a dead giveaway. For me, the
only fool-proof factor in freshman
identification is the eyes. You look so
overwhelmed and at the same time
optimistic. You haven't been hard-
ened by life around here yet, and it's
painted all over your shining young
faces.

I know, I know, the fact that you're
freshmen makes you self-conscious.
The fact that upperclassmen can spot
you from a mile away makes you
even more frantic. Relax, we know
you're just freshmen and we really
don't care. We're too wrapped up in
our own lives and plans to notice
you. _

You're here for orientation, right?
So, orient yourselves. This is a big
place. A new world brimming with
fresh faces and glitter. Many, if not
most, of you are away from home for
the first time. Take advantage of the
activities the university has planned
for you. Sure, I know they're general-
ly beat, and there's no alcohol, but
they are a good way to get a feel for
this place. Besides, you're not going
to get served in a bar around here.
The local tavern-keepers are on a red
alert because they know the only
people in town this early are 18 years
old. You'll have plenty of time to par-

ty over your next four years.

Q: Is it possible that I could sud-
denly and finally lose my hymen after
a whole year of being active sexually?

-A: That would certainly be
unusual. Perhaps you have been sex-
ually active without actually having
intercourse or in any other way stret-
ching the membrane. Nice, big,
seemingly knowledgeable young
women have told me stories that
showed a lot of confusion about their
own sexual behavior, and its pro-
bable consequences. Sometimes they
think they aren't virgins when they
are, and sadly, they can't be pregnant
when they definitely are.

Please have yourself examined by
a gynecologist and explain what is on
your mind — not out of fear, but just
to find out what is going on with your
own body.

Q: After high school graduation my
girl wanted an agreement that we
both could go around with other peo-
ple while we are away at separate
colleges. I exploded, and we broke
up ugly instead of nice and friendly.

  

P

When I was a freshman my biggest
concern for the first month or so was
to pretend I was anything but a
runny-nosed kid from a small town
in western Pennsylvania". I blew off
my orientation because I didn't want
to associate with the other freshmen.
As a result, I missed out on some
good times. I wonder if my freshman,
year would have been different had
I stuck with the orientation program.
So, go to the dances and scavenger
hunts. It sure beats sitting in your
room and watching T.V.

I almost envy you. You've got four
years of relative irresponsibility ahead
of you. Enjoy it while you can. Before
you know it, you'll be in my shoes.
As a 21-year-old senior who's seen
what this place has to offer. I can say
that I've had good and bad ex-
periences here. I'm looking forward
to moving ahead, but at the same
time I'd like to hold on to the past.
I will, and you will make the best
friends of your life here. College is
everything it's cracked up to be, and
more. The only bad thing is how fast
four years can slip by.

been breaking up and making up

about once a week, and it's always

about this agreement she wants that
I don't want. What do you think?

A: I think I've heard this before
somewhere. Maybe you two will be
carrying on like this right up to your

Senior offe

wedding day. Possibly you will

revive the dispute, with heat, right up
to your golden anniversary. And,
then again, it may be that by
Christmas you will be in love with
someone at your college, proving
that she was right and breaking her
heart.

You see, maybe she has made up
her mind to clear the decks for the
new world of college, and she may
come to think she was overdecisive.
Right now, she is not totally commit-
ted, right? My advice is to have a
wonderful freshman year.

Q: I hate to be mean to my best
woman friend, but I don't want to go
on vacation with her because I am
looking for a serious man and I think
I can do better on my own. I don't
want to look like someone who is so
hungry for companionship that she
can't go around by herself. And I
want to be free to move when I want
to, without abandoning my friend. I
want to go to a place where there are
men from my home area, a good

sleep?   

 

selection, so if-I meet. one we _can

continue with each other after wegét - I

home. Am I thinking right, or just be-
ing a rotten friend?

A: I think you have something
there. At least a plan worth trying. By
yourself, you can go around,_with a
guy without dumping your friend,
and he won't be scared off by two
women together who will compare
notes on him. Maybe you can con-
fide your big plan to your good
friend. If not, just tell her that you
have to get off by yourself for a little
while. And definitely plan to take an
extended weekend with her, before
or after vacation. You have to give
some time to a good friend.

exclusive sneak preview ofSept.

According to the two calendars
which hang in my office, September
is only two days away. We all think
we know what the month will offer;
especially me:

0 In September, students faithfully
attend classes —— if only for the first
two weeks. Afterward, students
faithfully attend classes about 50 per-
cent of the time. They figure they on-
ly have to show up enough to take
quizzes and let the instructors see
their faces. See you at the midterm.

0 In September, students faithfully

attend fraternity parties — at least
they did last year. This year may be
different, thanks to dry rush. The fre-
quent trips up the hill may not occur
until the party season — post-rush.
Then the houses will get trashed and
the pledges will clean up the mess.
- 0 In September, Pitt will lose a foot-
ball game. That is a lot better than
previous years when Pitt would lose
two or three football games in
September. Don't get spoiled though;
the Panthers play Miami at home,
and Notre Dame, Syracuse and Penn
State on the road after that. You're in
a game — maybe a long one.

0 In September, if you had an
apartment from the previous year and
your lease just ran out, you'll wonder

why you did not get your security‘

deposit back from your slumlord.
What hurts is that you probably left
the place cleaner that when it was
when you moved in. I guess you
forget to clean the inside of the lamp-
shade. Oh well, you're the one that
wanted to live in Oakland.

 

0 In September, Ted Windt will not
teach Presidential Rhetoric. Instead,
he will write a book and act cynical.
In January, Ted Windt will teach
Presidential Rhetoric. You better ar-
rive early so you can get a seat.

0 In September, you'll celebrate,
but I bet you won't be celebrating
Pitt's bicentennial. Instead, you might
celebrate a good score on an early
test, or a legal victory over your
slumlord. You might even celebrate
your birthday. You won't celebrate
my birthday though — it's not until
February.

0 In September, you might venture
onto the seventh floor of the William
Pitt Union for a party. It is called a
Judicial Board hearing, and you're
the guest or honor.

It turns out to be a little different
than a Tupperware party. I've heard

Maintaining Perspective; it's upto you

Go on. Admit it. You're looking for
amusement and argument, not en-
lightenment. That's probably why
you stopped when you turned to this
section.

There's nothing wrong with that.
The opinion section is like dynamite.
Properly used, it can level mountains
or change the course of rivers. But
one wrong move can cost you some
fingers. Besides, it's the only part of
the paper which is honest enough to
admit that its contents are part view-
point rather than total fact.

To help you enjoy this section safe-
ly, I am offering the following advice:
First, when reading an editorial, a col-
umn or a letter to the editor, avoid
taking it too seriously. Whenever you
read another person's opinion, you
are entering a world which will not
resemble your own. Get used to the
fact that some people disagree with
you,’ perhaps véhémehtly, and they

..1>7~<‘ .'-"_’='.‘ 

will not always express themselves in
writing the way you would.

You may decide that the opinion
page is like sex: It's not a spectator
sport. Perhaps you'll read something
which strikes you as immature — a
distinct probability with a student
newspaper. Its writers and editors are
learning. No one is born knowing all
there is to know about journalism.
Or, your opinion on a certain subject
differs from the one expressed in an
editorial, column or letter. You then
find yourself wanting to write a let-
ter to the editor. If so, reread the ag-
gravating piece when you're in a
better mood. You could be taking it
too seriously, or taking something
literally that was not intended that
way. I like to pull my readers’ legs
once in a while. It helps me maintain
the average college student's short at-
tention span.“ Some ‘people, -have

min_.d's like _’moto"rcyclé's'..' , . .

KEVIN BOLD

If you still want to reply, keep it
short. One typed page is all you'll
need at the most. Don't start with
something like, "This is in response
to Bob Whatsizname's Feb. 31 col-
umn, 'Bring Back Mercantilism.' " It's
flat, unoriginal, too obvious (all let-
ters to editors are responses to
something) and all too typical. " Bob
Whatizname ('Bring Back Mercan-
tilism,’ The Pitt News, Feb. 31,
2001), overlooked some pertinent
facts....” gets your letter rolling nice-
ly. Before sending it in, wait a day or '
two and then rewrite it, removing un-
needed modifiers and name-calling,
clarifying vague points and making
it shorter in general,T,hat way,‘ if your
letter ‘gets publi_shed',' it‘ will ‘appear

with a minimum of editing. Then ask
yourself it you want your name
published. If not, don't bother send-
ing it in. Freedom of speech is for
humans not cowards. A
You may find self-expression addic-
tive. If so, become a regular colum-
nist. It's a lot more fun than writing
letters to the editor. You pick your
own topic, and you can write longer
pieces. The guidelines for writing and
rewriting apply to columns too, so
don't forget them. And for goodness’
sake, don't read replies to your
writings. Most of them will probably
come from people who either
misunderstood you, just want to hurt
your feelings or just get their names
in the paper, and they will often ig-
nore the above guidelines.

0 In September, you'll wait in the
add-drop line at Thackeray Hall.
What makes you do this?

I.) You picked up your syllabus in
your history class and noticed the

following stipulations: weekly ‘S

quizzes, regular roll call, attendance
worth one-third of your grade, a

. 20-page term paper, a midterm and

final exam. Who's kidding whom?
See ya later.

2.)'You bumped into your old bud-
dy and his girlfriend has a work—study

job running off tests for the professors ‘

in a certain department.

You add five classes in that depart- '

ment. Mom and Dad will get the
grades in January and be happy: "See
what happens when you really
buckle down and study,-" Mom will
say. If they only knew.

0 In September, you'll break out

the winter clothing — but not

because it is cold. Sure, the leaves
turn brown, but if you really wanted

to dress like summer, you could. It '

would just be unfashionable.

0 In September, you'll read The Pitt
News — because it is free and easy
to get. You'll read it in your room, in
the restroom and even in class. Too
bad there won't be anything from
The Pitt News on your mid-term.

In October, you'll read The_ Pitt
News and find out what is going to
happen in October.

Dininganol working at the hot dog

-_ By Ava Smetangka
‘ Staff Writer

Ask any Pitt alumnus the best place

. to eat and run in Oakland, and the
answer will usually be the  The

Original Hot Dog Shop — the ”O”
—— has been a legend on campus
since Sid Simon opened it 26 years

' ago on the corner of Bouquet Street

and Forbes Avenue. Then, Forbes
Field, the former home of the Pirates,
was located across the street. The
Pirates may have had losing seasons,

 but the "O” certainly did not follow.

This January a second floor was
added and the ”O” can accom-
modate even more people.

According to Simon's daughter,
Terri Harrigan, the largest group of
people enter the doors during Pitt
football games. ”At last year's Pitt vs.
Penn State game,” Harrigan said,
”football fans were 12 deep from the
counter. Around 40,000 people
entered our doors during that par-
ticular day.”

Even on an ordinary day, ”five to
10,000 people pass through,” accor-
ding to Bruce Simon, the owner's
son.

-What attracts these large masses?
Well, it could be the fries, it could
be the hot dogs or it could be the
been

"All three —— hot dogs, fries and
beer — are equally challenged for the
No. 1 seller," said Bruce Simon.

The hot dogs that made them
famous are as juicy and tender as
ever. And what's even better is the
fact that they can be purchased for
$l.68.

If you thought McDonald’.s lriesl

were top-notch. sample the ”O” fries
and you won't be disappointed. Each
morning, workers carry up 750
pounds of fresh Idaho potatoes. They
are then placed in deep-fryers that
line the.who|e back wall and are sold

in four sizes, the smallest is 97 cents
and the largest is $4.25. And if it
seems expensive for a large fry, be
prepared to split the cost among two
of your friends, because it will pro-
bably take all three of you to finish
them. To give a rough idea of the
amount of fries that are sold a day,
Harrigan estimated that ”at least
1,500 pounds of potatoes are sold on
a slow night.” It's hard to imagine
what a good night would sell.

The third big seller is, of course, the
beer. The ”O” has one of the best im-
ported beer stocks in the city, with
over 325 from which to choose. The

Staff Writer

One night this summer behind the
beer counter at the Original Hot Dog
Shop, Bruce Simon, son of founder
Sid Simon, turned to one of his
workers and said, ’’I really think this
place is a monster. It's just a monster
sometimes.”

And he sighed.

There are times, when in the midst
of a rush, the ”O” can become just
that. There is no time to think of
courtesy or respect for the customer.
The single objective is getting the

daya need.”

It's not disrespect. A lone customer
is simply not what we are accus-
tomed to. On those nights when we
understand there is a slower pace we
are likely to say something like,
”Whaddaya need, sir (or ma’am)?”

which is better.
Because of the change that has

taken place in the past year or so, the
Simons may be looking to make the
”O” more than a weigh station on a
bar—hopping night.

There's a bar upstairs now. Occa-
sionally they'll call down for some
import beer they've run out of. If they

selection ranges from the well-known
Canadian beer Molson Golden, to
highly exotic beers unfamiliar to the
average beer drinker like Mamba, im-
ported from Africa. If you would
rather ”buy American,” you can
choose from a list that begins with
Blatz and ends with Schlitz. These
beers are sold for take-out only, but
they also have six beers on tap

customer away from the counter and
out to the street, where he or she
came from and belongs.

Most of us use a simple, ”Whad—
daya need,” or, as one of the night-

' shift guys likes to say, ”What’s next.

What's on it. Is that for here or to
throw up in the car?”

On the slower nights we are a
more congenial bunch. After several
nights of dealing with customers
three rows deep, however, we forget
that a person might be a little in-
timidated or offended by a ”Whad-

don't have it up there, we certainly
do downstairs.

One night, a guy came to the beer
counter downstairs and said, ’’Is that
all the imports you sell?”

He was serious.

All one can do in this case is turn
around, look at the 3x12 foot panel
listing a couple hundred brands, look
back at the guy and say, ”We||,
yeah.”

I With the bar upstairs came expan-
sion downstairs. There is now

those who want fries only. This
amounts to a lot of people.

A large order of fries weighs about
2% pounds. The boat for the new
extra-large version of fries can easily
be taken along on rainy nights and
used as an umbrella. Not for more
than three people, mind you.

The fries come from Idaho. Idaho-
ans probably have no taxes to pay
and a yearly state budget surplus
funded solely by the sale of potatoes
to this place.

We get them in boxes which hold
50 pounds. Every day they are car-
ried up from stock by the box,
tossed into a peeler/washer one by
one. After a quick rinse in the sink,
they go through an automatic slicer
and into a basket. From here they get
a five-minute blanch in peanut oil
fryers after which they are placed on
racks awaiting your order and a final
fry to golden brown.

All this sounds wonderful and the
fries are the best in these parts, but
it is also some of the grubbiest,
greasiest, pain-in-the-neck work in
the place. If it seems those behind the

fry counter aren't lifting their feet, it's ‘

because they are quietly sliding
through the peanut oil that is in-
evitably splashed around.

The ‘hamburger section sells
‘/2-pound burgers. There are 32

‘varieties to choose from.

’Nuff said.

Breaks are permitted, but not ap-
preciated. Just because we get tired
doesn't mean the customers aren't
out there waiting. This is why we
aren't there to get you with a national
fast-food chain smile. Looking at an
eight to 12 hour shift is not the best
way to bring a smile to one’s face.

Customers sometimes ask, ”Do
you eat the food here?” Well, we do.
It is good food.

It is insane, and it is a monster. We
all know that. We are equally proud
we can handle it.

It is hard to imagine the University
of Pittsburgh as it was 200 years ago.

' When Pitt was formed (first as Pitts-
- burgh Academy, later as Western

University of Pennsylvania) there was
no U.S. Constitution. Several moves,
which ended with the current
Oakland location and becoming
state-related, have changed the
university a great deal.

Now, the university has grown
strong and stable, as has the country.
The following -are some of the
memorable events that brought Pitt
to this point.

_- 1781 — Hugh Henry Brackenridge
left Philadelphia to pioneer in Pitts-
burgh. He started a newspaper that
would one day become the Pitts-
burgh Post-Cazette in 1786, and

' began working on a charter for an in-

stitution of higher learning.

1787 — Pittsburgh Academy, the
institution that fathered the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, received its official
chanen

1794 —— The forerunner of the Pitts-
burgh Theological Seminary is found-
ed. The Whiskey Rebellion, a protest
by Pennsylvaina farmers, was
crushed by the militia.

1816 — The borough of Pittsburgh
was incorporated into a city.

1819 — The Pittsburgh Academy
was replaced by the Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania that received its
charter on Feb. 18.

  Now, ste

1822 — The university enacted a
new policy regarding dueling among
students: ”Dueling, or any concern
in promoting or abetting it, shall be
punished in all cases by expulsion 
No student shall be permitted to wear
a dirk, or to carry any deadly weapon
whatsoever.” (Note: This was a huge
advance for peace on the campus.)

1823 — The first class graduated
from the university under the new
seven year program. Tuition was $25
for the first four years and $30 for the
last three. The first class in 1823
graduated three; 1824, five; 1825,
eight.

1845 — A fire swept through Pitts-
burgh, consuming 56 acres and all of
the university buildings and records.
The university reopened on the site
now occupied by the Horne’s depart-
ment store.

1849 —— Fire again destroyed all the
university buildings, forcing it to tem-
porarily close.

The university constructed a new
building on what would become
Forbes Avenue. Now standing there
is the City-County Building.

1865 —— The university acquired
the Allegheny Observatory. Two
years later, Samuel Pierpoint Langley
was elected the first director.

1869 — Chatham College, original-
ly the Pennsylvania College’ for
Women, was founded in Pittsburgh.

1875 — The university received
$25,000 from the estate of Charles
Avery, a progressive white clergy-
man, to provide free tuition for black
students.

1877 — Rioting railroad workers
broke into the university to steal
weapons used in student drills.
Repairs cost theuniversity $58.59.

1882 — The university moved
across the river to Allegheny City,
now the North Side.

1886 — The young university

awarded its first three doctoral
degrees.
1890 — University enrollment

reached a record high of 95 students.

1894 — Andrew Mellon was
elected to the university's board of
trustees.

1895 —— With the enrollment
swelled to 500, Andrew Carnegie
was elected to the board of trustees.

1896 — Samuel Langley launched
the first successful heavier-than-air
craft over the Potomac River. The
Wright brothers did not achieve
piloted flight for another seven years.
The plane he flew is now on display
in Forbes Quadrangle.

1897 — The university celebrated
its 110th anniversary.

1904 — The Pitt football team went
10 for 10, defeating Penn State for the
first time.

1905 — Mary Schenley, in the
largest real estate transaction in the
history of the city, sold 103 acres of
Schenley Farms to the Nicola syn-
dicate for nearly $3 million. The
university considered a move to
Oakland.

1908 —- The university, now the
University of Pittsburgh, moved to
Oakland. The panther was selected‘
as the Pitt mascot.

1912 — The Carnegie Institute of
Technology became a college in
Pittsburgh.

1920 - America's first radio sta-
tion, KDKA, began broadcasting in
Pittsburgh.

"-THE PITT NEWS, Friday, August 29, 1986

1921 —- Charles Bowman became
the chancellor of Pitt.

1924 —— Bowman described the
proposed Cathedral of Learning to
the architect as ”... the most beautiful
and outstanding building ever
erected. I am confident that Pitts-
burgh will build it.” The name for the
building was first used by a Scottish
architect who, upon seeing the plans
for the building, said, ”|t’s a Cadral
of Larnin’, that's what it is.” At first
the name was not liked, but it stuck.

Work began on the $2.2 million
Pitt Stadium. Covering 10 acres, the
stadium has 67,000 seats in 17 miles
of rows.

1925 — The Heinz family donated
nearly $1 million for the construction
of Heinz Chapel.

Pitt defeated Washington and Lee
in the first game at the new Pitt
Stadium with a score of 28-0.

1929 -— Bowman drove the final
rivet into the frame of the Cathedral
on Oct. 21. Three days after the com-
pletion of the frame, the stock market
crashed, sending the country into its
worst depression.

1931 —— ori Feb. 28,lthe first
classes moved into the Cathedral of
Learning.

1932 — Charles Glenn King, a Pitt
professor, announced that he isolated
vitamin.C. By the following year, he
had synthesized it in the laboratory.

1936 —John Woodruff, a Pitt mid-
dle distance and cross-country run-
ner, won the gold medal for the
800-meter event at the Olympics in
Berlin. He won the race as a
freshman.

Rooms were dedicated.

p back time, won't you?

1939 — Jock Sutherland, the win-
ningest coach in the school's history
with 111 victories, 20 losses and 12
ties, was rated as the best coach in
college football. The Saturday Even-
ing Post called him ”a national
hero.”

Hitler's blitzkrieg fell on Poland, ig-
niting World War II.

1943 — The Cathedral became the
center for the specialized training of
6,850 Army and 201 Navy person-
nel at cost. Of the 9,850 people from
Pitt who served in military service
during the war, 249 were killed.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, August 29, 1986

1956 — Pitt made an important
move toward racial equality when it
insisted that Bobby Grier be allowed
to play against Georgia Tech in the
Sugar Bowl. He was the first black
athlete to play in that bowl game.
Chancellor Nutting sent a pointed
four-word message to the governer of
Georgia: ”No Grier, no game.” Grier
played in the game.

1957 — On Oct. 4, the Soviet
Union launched Sputnik 1. One

1958 — Pitt signed an agreement
to buy Forbes Field, the home of the
Pittsburgh Pirates.

wife. They visited the Nationality
Rooms and saw the city from the top
of the Cathedral.

1960 — Point Park College was
founded in Pittsburgh.

Bill Mazeroski’s solo home run
over the left field wall at Forbes Field

' led the Pirates to a 10-9 victory over

the New York Yankees and a World
-Series championship. The plate that
Mazeroski stepped on is still en-
shrined under glass in Forbes
Quadrangle, and the point the ball
went over the left field wall is marked
by a plaque outside.

1963 — In tribute to assassinated
President John F. Kennedy, the Pitt-
Penn State game was postponed. Pitt

thers won 22-21.

1965 — Chancellor ‘Litchfield
resigned on July 20 when Pitt was
faced with financial crises.

The Pitt faculty dedicated the new
NASA Research Center. Dr. Homer
Newell, in an address at the dedica-

tivities carried on at the nation's
universities require competence and
talent of an extremly high order as
it is here at the University of Pitts-
burgh.”

state-related institution was signed on
Aug. 23. The state support allowed
Pitt to lower its'_tuition by almost 70

that Wesley Posvar would become
the new chancellor of the universi-
ty. Posvar was a political science pro-
fessor and a former Rhodes Scholar.

pressed dispair about the future of
education at the university. Com-
munity endowments were not as
common as in the past and Pitt
struggled for minimum funding.

Wesley’ Posvar outlined his plans for
Pitt. ”Our foremost concern is with
quality. We will become more con-
cerned to know our special
strengths and to reinforce them."

ting the first major cooperative effort
of combining state funds with those
of private donations from the Hillman
Foundation and the Hillman family.

Association of American Universities, -
a select group of 50 of the best "
schools in the country.

sity from the debt that had plagued
the institution since Posvar took
office.

yards to become the leading rusher
in college history. At the end of an
undefeated Panther season, Dorsett

The football team in 1890, a squad of thirteen with a
mascot. The players furnished their own uniforms and
chipped in to buy the football.

In April 1920, on an unknown occasion, the students
and faculty form the Pitt Panther.

This is the history of a major American urban university from its birth on the western frontier in the eighteenth century down to the year in which it celebrates its 200th anniver-
sary. Told mainly through the stories of its energetic and sometimes eccentric Chancellors -— one led his students on bird-hunting expeditions in order to teach them taxidermy,
and another was inspired by the rising crescendos of Wagner's ”Fire Music” to sketch the plans for a skyscraper schoolhouse —-— it is a colorful and readable chronicle of the
University of Pittsburgh.

The story begins in the early spring of 1781, when a young and ambitious lawyer named Hugh Henry Brackenridge took a measured assessment of his opportunities for advance-
ment in Philadelphia. ’’I saw no chance,” he said, ”for being anything in that city, there were such great men before me.”

Brackenridge crossed the Alleghenies and settled in the frontier town of Pittsburgh. "My object," he wrote with characteristic directness, ”was to advance the country [Western
Pennsylvania] and thereby myself.” He founded Pittsburgh Academy — later to be the Western University of Pennsylvania and then the University of Pittsburgh — and lived
to see the school grow along with the city. .

In 1823, the first graduating class of the Western University consisted of three students, and all became clergymen. By 1898, when the first two women were graduated -1--
the Stein sisters — they had only twenty—six classmates. Today, some-7,000 men and women receive undergraduate and graduate degrees each year.

Robert C. Alberts, author of the history, had full access to all the University archives, and he describes many issues for the first time. Among them is the role played by the
Board of Trustees in the conflicts of the administration of Chancellor John Gabbert Bowman, including the firing of a controversial history professor, Ralph Turner; the resignation
of the legendary football coach Jock Sutherland; and a Board investigation into Bowman's handling of faculty and staff.

The book also tells of Pitt's decade of progress under Edward Litchfield (1956-1965) who ”gamb|ed that the millions of dollars that he spent  would be forthcoming from
somewhere or someone; but who, as it turned out, was mistaken.” The Litchfield story has never been told so fully and frankly.

Pitt became a state-related university in August 1966, but financial stability was achieved only gradually-during the administration of Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar. The major
crisis of the 19605 and 19705 to Americansociety as well as the University of Pittsburgh, was the Vietnam War, and the student protests that accompanied it are described in
detail, as they affected Pitt. 1 , .

The history also is concerned with more current matters: Pitt's emergence as a force in international higher education; the institution's role in fostering a cooperative relationship
with business; and its entry into the postindustrial age of high technology. -

As Alberts writes in his preface, in the past of the University, ”There was drama; there was tragedy; there were indeed controversy and politics. There were, unexpectedly,
rich veins of humor, occasionally of comedy." _ ~ -

Freeman expresses optimism and pride

Executive Vice President lack Freeman has, been an ad-
ministrator for the University of Pittsburgh since 1967.

-By Dirk Kaufman
Staff Writer

Jack E. Freeman came to the University of Pittsburgh shortly after the ar-
rival of President Wesley Posvar in 1967. Excluding a brief and controver-
sial two-week tenure as President of the University of Maine System this past
summer, Freeman has been a part of Pitt administration for the past 19 years.

He has served as executive vice president since 1979 and is Posvar’s prin-
cipal adviser in respect to long-range planning, policy analysis and resource
management. A career officer in the U.S. Air Force before coming to Pitt,
Freeman has long been a proponent of furthering ties between industry,
government and higher education.

On August 14, the Pitt News interviewed Freeman for his observations
on the past, present and future of the University of Pittsburgh as the univer-
srtycelebrates its bicentennial.

The Pitt News: How important is
the bicentennial, not only as a
celebration, but in terms of pro-
motion?

Freeman: Obviously the bicenten-
nial alone is not so important. What
it does, it seems to me, is primarily
give us an opportunity to let the
world know what the University of
Pittsburgh is all about today. It gives
us an opportunity to focus upon the
important work that is going on at this
institution: Upon its quality, upon the
growth and improvement at this in-
stitution as an important entity in
higher education. That's the real im-
portance of it.

The Pitt News: There are many
events that have changed the course
of history at Pitt. We'd like to list
some of them and get your comment
on their importance:

On August 23, 1966 Pitt became
a state-related university. Has that

-changed the course of the university?

Freeman: Oh, it was a fundamen-
tal departure, vitally important. Prior
to that time Pitt had been growing in
reputation and standing, but it had
been handicapped because it was a
private institution that had received
some state assistance but not a great
deal.

We became an institution that had
many of the strengths of a private in-
stitution. in a strictly legal sense we
remained a kind of independent in-
stitution. But, as a state-related
university we gained access to state
funding which has permitted us to
greatly strengthen the academic
standing of the university, the
physical facilities, and has enabled-
us, most importantly probably, to
lower tuition, to open up educational

opportunities here at Pitt that,were
formerly closed to a great many able
students from this part of the country.
That was a clear change in direc-
tion for the university, and probably
is the single most significant event in
the last 100 years of its history.

The Pitt News: in January of '67,
Dr. Wesley Posvar came here to
serve as chancellor. How much of a
change has he made?

Freeman: Well, I think Dr. Posvar
came at that point in which one had
to begin to change the university to
coincide with that new set of respon-
sibilities that the university had as
essentially a public university.

Dr. Posvar was faced with a lot of
very enormous problems. We had
close to $30 million in debt at the
time and certainly before he arrived
they went through almost a virtual
bankruptcy. He had 'to figure out
what we were going to do with the
state money, how we were going to
restructure our programs and our
orientation in order to meet the new
obligations as a public institution. He
had to develop new programs, recruit
new faculty and establish a whole
new administrative structure.

I think that the success and growth

'1 It really is the
Posvar era in the his-

tory of the university’ '

-1 V. P. lack Freeman

 
of this university in the last 20 years
has been directly related to the,
leadership that Dr. Posvar has been
able to provide. The strength, the
quality, the stability of the financial
and academic reputation of this in-

stitution will certainly be closely
related to the kind of leadership that
Dr. Posvar has provided during that
period of time.

It really is the Posvar era, if you
will, in the history of the university.

The Pitt News: in 1976 mortgages
that were on university buildings
were finally burned, which is only
nine years after Posvar had arrived.
Are there any mortgages left?

Freeman: There are a lot of mort-
gages left. In that period prior to state
relatedness we had borrowed heavi-
ly both externally and internally. That
kind of internal borrowing is not a
healthy sign in any institution. It
greatly limits your ability to do things.

When Dr. Posvar became
chancellor in 1967, that $27 million,
which doesn't sound like much
money now but represented 50 per-
cent of our whole budget at the time,
was a huge burden for the university
to carry. He recognized early on that
the university's strength depended on
our ability to repay those dollars so
that we could do some more creative
kind of things. And so the manage-
ment of the university's finances and
plans during that period of time from
1967 _to 1976 was very carefully
handled in order to retire that in-
debtedness which was kind of an an-
chor on the future growth of the
university.

So it was a very significant event
that freed us of that burden.

The Pitt News: This is kind of
separate from a lot of the work that
you do but I think it was certainly im-
portant in terms. of national
recognition.

Assistants to co nce nt rate on 0lU3lli’€Yfl 2

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

For as many years as can easily be
remembered, there have been
teaching assistants at Pitt who speak
English as a second language. For
almost as many years, there have
probably been students who have
struggled to understand the material
being presented and the instructor's
speech with equal difficulty.

In the last two years, these prob—
lems of language difficulty have
come to a head at the university. in
the fall of '84 and the winter of '85,
students in the College of General
Studies were so displeased with the
teaching services they received that
they demanded a tuition refund, ac-
cording to CGS Dean John Bolvin.

”However,” Bolvin said, ”since
that time, there have been significant

changes made in the process used to - v

evaluate the non-native TAs”
Bolvin indicated that there have
been new and more strict re-
quirements for the evaluation of the
foreign TAs since those problems.

When asked whether he felt the
system and the quality of instruction
was better now, he replied, ”Yes,
definitely. There have been im-
provements  those problems have
been eliminated.”

Each of the new foreign TAs at Pitt

Campus
activities
By Ava Smetanka

Staff Writer

If after attending numerous parties
and possibly a night consisting of ”a
few too many,” you decide to slow.
down your pace, many activities and
events have been planned within the
Pitt campus.‘ 1

The most publicized activities
around campus at the moment are
those organized by panhellenic rush,
the Greeks. To begin their rush, a
watermelon picnic will be held Sept.
2 on the Cathedral Lawn. Here,
freshmen can meet the different
fraternities and sororities and, if in-
terested, can attend further Greek
gatherings. These include ”meet the
Greeks” in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom on Sept. 3 at 8 p.m. or the
panhellenic rush orientation and
open house in the WPU Assembly
Room at.5 p.m. on Sept. 4. After at-
tending these, registration for rush
can be obtained on Sept. 5.

If the Greeks aren't your style, and
your interest is sports, there is plenty
to watch here at Pitt. The opening Pitt
football game is on Sept. 1 and it is
against Maryland. No loyal Pitt foot-
ball fan should miss this game which

is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. The

next home game is Pitt vs. West
Virginia on Saturday, Sept. 27 at
12:10 p.m. These are the only two
home football games in September,
but there are numerous other sport-
ing events tobe seen. n

The Pitt Program Council has also
scheduled many events for. students
through September (as well as the
school year) if you still find time after
attending Greek affairs and sporting
events. The PPC has arranged two

outings for the month of September, '

a White-Water Rafting trip and a Pitts-
burgh Zoo trip. They will be offered
to the students and possibly guests at
a fee not yet determined. These
outings are new to the PPC and in-
dicate the expansion of the program.
Tom Misuraca, assistant director of
the PPC, said that ”a higher quality
of activities are being planned for this
year.” Besides the two outings
previously mentioned, the PPC has
many movies and lectures planned.
Among the movies being shown dur-
ing September are Rocky IV, Back to
the Future and Jron Eagle.

For the more intellectually in-
clined, lectures are scheduled
throughout the year. The first will be

égiven by Max Weinberg Sept. 18 at

must go through a screening process
that evaluates their ability to convey
ideas to a class, their command of the
language and their ability to field
questions from the students.

As outlined in a memo from the
FAS Graduate Council, the evalua-
tion consists of an interview with
Betsy Davis of the department of
linguistics and a faculty member of
the TA’s department. During this in-

according to evaluation specialist
Debbie Hazlett.

”We are very strict with confiden-
tiality in this office,” she said. ”The
services we offer are mostly voluntary
on the part of the TA and if they knew
that the results of the surveys were
going to be made public, they might
be less willing to have the surveys
performed.

”There should be strict policy to

 

‘terview, the prospective TAs are

given a language test. Any student
with a low score on this test is re-
quired to take a specially designed
course to improve their linguistic and
teaching skills.

After the students have begun
teaching, student surveys are ad-
ministered by the Office of the
Evaluation of Teaching. The results of
these surveys are confidential,

" ‘II? gooo’ for them to

improve the quality of teaching 
students pay tuition and deserve
competent teaching,” Hazlett said.

When asked what she thought of
the program for TA support at Pitt,
Hazlett said, ”We have very strong
services in this and other offices. The
individual departments are making
considerable headway with their pro-
grams. Pitt is lucky in that respect.”

The reports of the surveys she ad-

ministers go to FAS Dean Elizabeth
Baranger, who evaluates the
responses to certain questions to
determine whether there are
language problems with any of the
TAs.

Beyond the initial testing, the
departments have other methods for
keeping the quailty of their TAs
teaching high. Ka-Sing Lau, a pro-
fessor in the math department and the
faculty member charged with super-
vision of the TAs, said that there are
awards in his department each year
for the best TA.

” There is some money included
with the award and that acts as an in-
centive for the people. It's good for
them to know someone notices when
they've done a good job.”

One of the services available to the
TAs is the videotaping of a class ses-
sion for evaluation of their teaching
ability;

Robert Wolke, director of the Of-
fice of Faculty Evaluation, said,
”Quite a few of the teaching
assistants use our services, especial-
ly the videotaping. We also publish
a handbook for teaching services to
inform the TAs about the regulations
for teaching at Pitt.” ‘

He was not able to say whether the
number of TAs using his services in-

creased after the system came u_nder
fire last year.

"The number of__,people_that take
advantage of our office varies con-
siderably from term to term. A 20 or
30 percent increase probably‘

wouldn't even be noticed,” he said. ]

Even with all of the services and re-
quirements for the new foreign TAs,
most of the responsibility falls on the
department the TA is a part of. Wolke
stated, ”We [the evaluation services]
don't insert ourselves into the depart-‘
mental functions.” ‘

He went on to say that a large , 

number of the requests he gets for

video evaluation come from the in 2; 

dividual departments. '

In the chemistry department for ex-

ample, each of the foreign TAs are _ 

evaluated by their classes each term.
These evaluations are reviewed by

Richard Howe. Those TAs with a bet- A 
ter command of the language are put 1' S "

into the recitation sections. while

assistants with more problems with 
the language are assigned to the, labs. _  5

As long as there are foreign 
teaching assistants at the university,- 1

there will probably be language-
related pioblems. Through the efforts
of the faculty and the review services,

though, the majority of difficulties if 

can be eliminated.

Trustees continue
selective divestment

.By Dirk Kaufman
Staff Writer

Despite the year-long efforts of the Pitt group Students for a Free South
Africa, no apparent policy change has occurred in Pitt's South African in-
vestments.'Pitt still has approximately $15 million invested in companies
doing business in South Africa, according to Pitt assistant treasurer Michael
Hagan. = ’

”There hasn't been a change in investment policy since the last board of
trustees meeting,” Hagan said.

At the last board meeting in May, the trustees voted to create an advisory
committee to address the issue of South African investments. This task force
will advise the board's investment committee, who will make a presenta-
tion to the boardtduring the October meeting. '

The board of trustees continues to supporta position of selective divest-
ment, in which Pitt divests from companies that do not adhere to the Sullivan
Principles (see this page).

I The board of trustees voted in May of 1985 to adopt more rigorous stan-
dards of performance from these companies. Pitt reviews the findings of the
Research Consortium on American Corporate Investments in South Africa

and the International Council for Equality of Opportunity Principles Inc.

If these reports find a company is not making satisfactory progress under

‘the «Sullivan Principles, Pitt will divest from that company.

Pitt also subscribes to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, an in-
dependent, non-profit organization that analyzes economic and social issues
in South Africa.

Since subscribing, Pitt has divested of 15 companies not making satisfac-
tory progress following the Sullivan Principles.

The Sullivan Principles

— Non-segregation of the races
in all eating, comfort and work
facilities.

— Equal and fair employment
practices for all employees. a
- Equal pay for all employees
doing equal or comparable work
for the same period of time.

—.— Initiation and development of
training programs that will
prepare, in substantial numbers,
blacks and other non-whites for
supervisory, administrative,
clerical and technical jobs.

— Increasing the number of
blacks and other non-whites in
management and supervisory
positions.

— Improving the quality of

employees’ lives outside the work
environment in such areas as
housing, transportation, educa-
tion, recreation and health
facilities.
The principles were named after
Rev. Leon Sullivan, a minister and
the only black member of the
General Motors board of direc-
tors. They were developed to help
distinguish companies according
to their treatment of blacks. Selec-
tive divestment allows investment
in those companies which follow
these guidelines.

Brutus hoping for
changein pohcy

By Dave Zafris

News Editor

The Pitt group Students for a Free South Africa made a impact on campus
last year. They brought the issue of divestment to the forefront with demonstra-
tions and rallies on the Cathedral Lawn. But the group fell short of its goal
to persuade Pitt's board of trustees to totally divest from companies doing
business with South Africa. *

Dennis Brutus, however, might be able to use his experience to help con-
vince the board to divest. A South African exile and renowned poet, Brutus
will become the head of Pitt's black studies department on September I.
A faculty member at Swarthmore College, Brutus actively lobbied for the
school's total divestment. Swathmore recently divested about $47 million
from companies doing business.

’’I look forward to the day very shortly when Pitt will also vote to divest,”
Brutus said. I . A

Brutus tries to dispel the belief that it would hurt South African blacks if
U.S. companies pulled out.

”As an exile, as a political prisoner, I want to make it clear that I speak
forthe majority of the people in South Africa,” he said. ”We want total divest-
ment immediately. ‘

”Right now the money that is going into South Africa is helping to main-
tain a racist, repressive, ‘minority in power,” he said. ’’If you take away that
money you will weaken their capacity to repress. You will force.them to
negotiate about the sharing of power with the 80 percent [of South Africa's
population] that are now excluded from the political process.”

Brutus was granted political asylum in the United States in 1983.

IMPROVED STUDENT HEALTH ,
INSURANCE

One day in a local hospital can easily cost in
excess of $500! That is a good reason why the pro-
visions of the voluntary student health insurance
plan have been significantly broadened for
1986-87. The recommendations of a student users
committee, The Director of the Student Health Ser-
vice, Frank Carter; The Executive Assistant to the
Vice President for Student Affairs, Robert G.
Houston and the University Risk Manager, Mrs. Nan-
cy Graham, were incorporated into the new plan.

Among the features of the plan are these
benefits: $300 per day hospital room and board,
surgical expenses up to 81,500, physicians fees
when in hospital, $250 emergency out-patient,
$1,200 for in hospital expenses. In addition, 80%
of all other medical expenses for an accident or
sickness are paid to a maximum of 315,000.

All full-time or part-time Pitt students may enroll
in the program before September 30. The pro-
gram should be utilized by any student who does
not have similar protection under a family policy
or their own policy. Since many employer spon-
sored health insurance programs have been revis-
ed in the past several years, every student should
be certain of their present insurance status.

The annual cost of the program for an individual
student is $305. Dependents can also be insured
for additional premiums. No physical examina-
tions are required for participation.

 I AI  study   vol un tee 
 see progress, problems

By Dirk Kaufman
Staff Writer

t’s confidential.
Those words are tagged to nearly every aspectof the Pitt Men's
Study, an AIDS research project in the Graduate School
of Public Health.

The study began in 1983, two years after the viral disease AIDS was
discovered in the United States. It s primary mission is to gather infor-
mation on the natural history of AIDS. The information the study seeks
is ofa very personal nature and must remain confidential, a condition
which inherently conflicts with the goals of public health organizations.

Without confidentiality, there would be no study.

Because of it, some who are documented as carrying the AIDS virus
do not know it.

"It's a real dilemma in that the success and outcome of the study
is very dependent on keeping people in the study," said clinical director
Dr. David Lyter. ”We’re very concerned that forcing people to get

results will have negative effects on the study.”

John is a 22-year-old student at a Pittsburgh area college, who, as
with other participants quoted, volunteered to speak with The Pitt
News. The Pitt Men’s Study does not permit any organization or per-
son outside the study to see the names of subjects.

”The records are not accessible. If they were accessible, they [the
Pitt Men's Study} would lose everything,” he said.

The study seeks to achieve two separate goals. ,

First, it tests and interprets the results of blood and body fluid samples
taken from homosexual males. This data is recorded and kept to help
determine the natural history of the disease.

Second, volunteers in the study are educated in transmission and
prevention of the spread of the virus, now called HIV, Human Immuno-
deficiency Virus. This involves discussion of safe sex practices. Ac-

-cording to Dr. Lawrence Kingsley, an epidemiologist with the study,

the largest single cause of the disease is anal sex.

The study is funded until 1987, but Lyter hopes and expects it to
receive renewed funding. ”If it goes for six years or 10 years, and we
know everybody who developed AIDS at a particular time, at the end
of the study we can take all those people and compare them with peo-
ple that didn't develop AIDS and try to understand what differences
there were,” said Lyter

Because of the study’s confidentiality, volunteers are not required
to attend the educational sessions or to see the results of their tests.

Though the tests may determine a volunteer is carrying the virus,
without consent from him no notification or information is given. ”We
have over 1,900 men in the study,” said Lyter. ”Forty percent have
said, ’Yes, I want the results,’ eight percent have said outright, ‘No,

University placement center says

early registration helps chances

By G.B. Patterson

Perspective Editor

Senior alert: Before all you would-
be-graduates settle into the mode of
relaxed seniordom, take a walk to the
William Pitt Union and make one last
effort to insure that you have
something to do after you leave this
fine institution.

There you will find the University
Placement Service located on these-
cond floor of the student union.
Waiting there is a group with the
knowledge and experience to get
students a job, or at least a start in the
right direction.

Simply put, the University Place-
ment Service provides you with the
tools to get a job. How do they do
this? Well, it's actually a simple, but
very intense process. After all, those
on-campus interviews will start ear-
ly in October. So, now is the time to
start the hunt.

What you will do when you go to
the University Placement Service is
attend an orientation session which
gives an overview of the job hunt
process. Then you will register with
the University Placement Service and
draft your resume and cover letter.

After that, you can attend as many

- workshops as you want. These

workshops range in topic from suc-
cessful interviewing to writing win-
ning resumes. You will then have the
basic tools needed tosign up for and
participate in on-campus interviews.

There are two things to keep in
mind. First, use the services offered.
Only seniors can interview with com-
panies visiting Pitt. '

Second, and more importantly,
start now. September is the month to
get your act together and October is
the month to perform well enough to
get a job.

In 1985 2,014 students registered
with the‘University Placement Ser-
vice. 500 employers visited the cam-

. pus. It was those people who started

their job search early who had the
best shot at landing a job.

One very important service offered
is resume referral. The University
Placement Service will keep your
resume on file and send it to
employers with whom you could not
interview, or employers who did not
send campus representatives but
need people with specific
qualifications.

The Univeristy Placement Service
at Pitt has been successful. In fact, Pitt
was chosen this year to host the
Chrysler Plymouth Career Search
Workshop. This is a program that will
be offered nationally by Business
Week's Careers. It will consist of a
one hour presentation of the steps
students need to take for a successful
job search. There will be several

times when the session will be
offered:

Monday, Sept.15, at 11 a.m., 3 p.m.
and 7 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 16, at 10
a.m. and 2 p.m.

All workshops will be held in the
assembly room in the student union.
There will be job-seeking materials
distributed and time for students to
ask questions.

Your first move toward a future job
should be going tothe University
Placement Service and picking up a
calendar of events. Besides getting
seniors on the road to a job, there are‘
job postings for current openings.

There are counselors assigned to
your specific major who can help
you with any problem you may have.
Also, there is an employer library
with information and addresses of
employers in w_hom you might be in-
terested.

0 Campus life hinders
O dedication to faith

By Rebecca Clothey
For The Pitt News

ncoming freshman Georgia
Petropoulos is flipping through the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences’ fall term
"class schedule while she rests in front
of the William Pitt Union. She’s just
finished her math placement test and is impatient-

 

”Right now I just have to get the placement tests
and making my schedule out of the way,” she said.
”Then I'll worry about everything else.”

”Everything else” that Georgia has to worry about
includes buying books, paying tuition bills and ad-
justing to college classes. Also, she will probably
be confronted with the problem of creating a social
life in a school about 20 times the size of her high
school

Her college life will be a lot different than it was
just a few months ago. Her everyday routines will
be changed. And there's a good chance she won't
go to church as regularly as she used to.

”Students are often apathetic about their religion
while in college because they want to pursue other
avenues, or they have no time or no need for their

. religion,” said the Rabbi Joseph Levine of the B’nai
B’rith Hillel Jewish University Center.

The student's routine of practicing his or her faith
is often one of the first things dropped when living
at college. Some students might be like junior Kirk Smythe, who
said he goes to church only once in a while because now he
doesn't have to.

”| used to get dragged to church when I was a kid,” he said.
”Now that I'm in college I go alone occasionally but I'm usually
too sick on Sunday morning from partying Saturday night.”

Mary White, a Pitt sophomore, said she got out of the habit
of going to church when she came to college.

”I used to go to church with my family when it was very ear-
ly, but now I don't feel like getting up,” she said.

When an 'I 8-year-old lives away from home for the first time,
the temptation is to break from old lifestyles. The Reverend
Bryan Summers, from the Roman Catholic University Oratory
Parish, said students often put their faith on hold until they get
out of college.

”Often students aren’t attentive to their religion because
they're struggling for freedom from their parents,” he said.

Pitt sophomore Karen Shallayda said another reason might
be that students don't have anyone to go to church with.

'1 It’s hard to find a different
church, and there's no one to go with.’ '

— Karen Shallayda.

 

”I go to church regularly when I'm at home, but I never at-
tend when I'm away at school. It's hard to find a different church,
and there's no one to go with,” she said.

But there are campus religious groups who can provide a
sense of community that many students miss after leaving home.
Patty Kumer-, a Pitt senior, is active in the university oratory.

”There’s a social aspect involved,” she said. ’’I’m more ac-
tive with the church while I'm at Pitt than I am at home. Here
I have more of an opportunity to go. Everything is available right
on campus.”

Kumer attends Wednesday night group meetings for

undergraduates at the oratory. The students prepare a meal for
themselves and then hold a question and answer period after
dinner. .

She said that joining a group like the oratory makes you want
to. go to church again.

”l've developed a circle of friends with a common interest.
I've found people I can trust and a place to go.”

Reverend Summers said that more students are turning to
religion than in previous years.

”Students are not as anti—institutiona| as they used to be. They
are more interested in traditional values than they were in the
early ’70s.”

But Rabbi Levine still sees problems with religion at Pitt.

”Al| religious experience ties in with involvement in the com-
munity. This is difficult to achieve at Pitt because of the large,
sprawling campus. There's no single place to hold services as
well as have social gatherings. Therefore it's difficult to find the
heart of the religious community.”

While enduring the crush of col-
lege boredom, nothing buoys the
spirit like the dream of a cruise on an
ocean liner. Imagine taking a break

W from your books to see the pyramids

in Egypt or the ancient cities of China.

Twice each year, the University of
Pittsburgh and the Institute of Ship-
board Education give 500 students
the opportunity to make these dreams
a reality.

Called Semester at Sea, the pro-
gram they offer combines the excite-
ment of a world cruise with quality
instruction to produce a three month
adventure and a lifetime of benefit.

In 1920, James Lough, a professor
at the University of New York,
became interested in the idea of an
ocean-"going university. He felt that
the best path. to a broader under-
standing of the world is firsthand ex-
perience.

group of New York students, Lough

504 college students on the first
journey. The program progressed
steadily until 1936 when the ship and
the idea of a traveling university were
put on hold due to a turbulent world
economic scene.

In 1958, the idea was revived by
Gerald Black, a Whitmore, CaIif.,
dentist and president of the local
Rotary club. The club wanted to take
a definitive step toward world peace,
thus forming a committee to study the
idea, appointing Bill Hughes as its
chairman.

Hughes thought that a mobile
university would give students from

around the world a chance to meet .

each other and study foreign cultures
firsthand. In San Francisco, he met
Raises and began plans to establish
the University of the Seven Seas.

After some problems with finding
a suitable ship, the Seven Seas set sail
from the New York harbor in 1963,

marking the beginning of renewed in- '

terest in a floating university that con-

tinues today.

Q‘  

     

universe

in 1966.

When the Holland America Line
could no longer afford to support the
project, a shipping broker named
Chao-Yung Tung stepped in. When
fire struck the Chapman ship, Tung
purchased a new liner, the Atlantic,
to give to the college. By 1975, Chap-
man was no Ionger able to continue
its support and the search for a new
sponsor was begun.

Two men from the Chapman pro-
gram, David Griffith and John
Tymitz, formed the Institute for Ship-
board Education to continue the pro-
gram. Recalling that time, Tymitz
said, ”We were concerned about the
future of the program. I felt that it
would continue, but we weren't sure
how or where. There were some key
people that were vejy enthusiastic

and very dedicated.”

The present Semester at Sea pro-
gram was conceived by these two
men, and the organization they
formed continues to offer its services
today.

In 1981, Pittsigned an agreement
with the institute, and the ship sailed
in the spring of that year.

Richard Pratt, the academic dean

, on a recent voyage, said he is still

very excited about the semester he
spent on the ship.

’’It was a very good experience,”
he said. ”There was a fantastic rap-
port between the students and the
faculty. There was far more oppor-
tunity for contact at all hours  a
stimulating academic experience.”

Pratt said that the duties of the
academic dean begin about a year

before the program starts with the
course selection process and the hir-
ing of faculty. The dean is also
responsible for designing the pro-
grams for the time the ship is in port,
usually three to five days.

”The students are free to go off on
their own at these stops, but there are
planned trips to points of interest in
the area,” Pratt explained.

Attilio Favorini of the theater arts
department will be the academic
dean on the voyage in the fall.

”We have a good mix of young,
very enthusiastic faculty and older,
more experienced and learned in-
structors,” said Favorini.

When asked if increasing world ter-
rorism has played a part in planning
the schedule for the semester,
Favorini said terrorism has had an
impact.

”We’ve had to make changes due
to actual and perceived dangers.
Parents and students see the Mediter-
ranean as a dangerous place, so we
canceled the stop in Greece. Also,
we won't be going to Egypt because
of the Sri Lankan terrorists who have
been operating there."

Pitt freshman Jennifer Corwin was
on the ship last spring.

’’It was the most wonderful thing
lever did in my entire life,” she said.

”I would recommend the Semester A

at Sea to anyone who can afford it.”

With a cost between $8,000 and’
$10,000, affording the program can
be an obstacle. However, John
Tymitz, the present director of the
program, said, ”there is a lot.of ﬁnan-
cial aid that almost goes begging here
each year. I just don't think people
realize that it's available.”

When asked whether she thought
communication was going to be a
problem for her, Corwin replied that,
”at first, I was scared, but when we
got to the foreign ports, we just used
our hands a lot and always carried
paper to draw pictures. ‘It really
wasn't much of a problem.

’_’Hong Kong was my favorite stop
on the long trip. Most of the people
there spoke English. Also, we hadn't
had any American food for two
months and they had a McDonald's.
I was impressed with how modern
the city was.

”The atmosphere on the ship was
very relaxed. Everyone gotalong real-
ly well. The classes were great and
the only really intense studying was
right around ﬁnals. The students were
more interested in getting to know
each other than in studying."

She remembered the time the ship
was not able to go to Egypt because
terrorists had bombed the harbor.

”The bombing kind of brought us
all back to Earth. When we were on
the ship, there was a feeling of peace,
like the rest of the world didn't exist.
You felt like nobody could touch
you."

A As testimony to the resourcefulness
of the administrators of the program,
the institute changed the schedule of
the cruise so that the students had the
opportunity to spend the remaining
time studying at a university in Israel.

"The university is extremely far-
sighted in sponsoring this program,”
said Favorini. "Students who take ad-
vantage of it will simply be better

By John Benson

Staff Writer
What is the College of General

Studies? Where is it? Who attends it?

Some of Pitt's day students had
some interesting answers to‘ these
questions.

’’I think it's a branch campus,”
answered one. '

”It’s somewhere in the Cathedral,”
answered another.

One CAS student claimed it's for ’

’’people with undecided majors."
Still another said CGS is ”night

school for older people who work-

during the day."
Other answers included: ”|t’s for

transfer students,” ”|t’s in the student

union” and ”I don't know.”

The correct answer to the first ques-
tion is simple: The College of General
Studies is an undergraduate college
within the University of Pittsburgh.

”We’re a self—contained unit,” said
CGS Associate Dean Dr. Robert
Comfort. ”We offer over 500 courses

’ each term, we have our own admis-

sions and registration departments
and we do our own advising with a
staff of nine professional academic
advisors.”

CGS has over 30 departments, and
offers B.S. and B.A. degrees in 26 ma-
jors. The faculty of CGS is assigned
by the respective departments. in the
university. Most of the courses are of-
fered at night, but both day and Satur-

day classes are available.

CGS also has its own student
government and monthly newsletter
that is mailed to all CGS students. It
even has the College for the Over Six-
ty that offers non-credit courses to
senior citizens for $10 per course.

As to the second question, CGS is

‘ ”somewhere in the Cathedral.” The

administration, admissions, registra-
tion and advising departments are all
on the fourth floor of the Cathedral
of Learning, and it was completely
renovated last year. _

CGS students share Pitt's main
buildings and classrooms with CAS
students, but courses are also offered
at off-campus locations. CGS students
can take Pitt classes on a full- or part-
time basis in Penn Hills, Shaler,
South Hills and downtown Pitts-
burgh.

Now as to who are the students,
which is probably the most difficult
question. A

According to Sherry Brown, direc-
tor of registration, CGS students have
a wide variety of backgrounds.
”There are really no typical CGS
students. Some are transfer students,
some want to change or advance
their careers, some are here for per-
sonal enrichment. It varies greatly,"
Brown said.

”CGS is central to the university -
it is the primary means through
which the university is able to meet

the needs of the non-traditional stu-
dent,” according to the 1985 CGS
Annual Report.

According to the annual report,
more than 50 percent of CGS’s 6,000
students have attended college
elsewhere. Betsy Emry is one of
them.

Emry, 22, transferred to CGS three
years ago from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania and considers herself
non-traditional.

”I guess it's non-traditional to
transfer to a university and not know
what courses or major you want,”
Emry said, ”but I did.”

lot of my transferred credits to meet
the requirements when I did decide
on a major.”

Emry is scheduled to graduate from
CGS with a B.A. in communications
in December.

Another student chose CGS
because of its flexible major pro-
grams. Steve Robinson, 21, is
transferring from CAS this fall,

‘because he didn't want a dual major

— a requirement for CAS business
management majors. ”I didn't want
a double major,” he said. ’’I just
wanted a business management
degree and CGS allowed me to do

I I There really is no typical C GS student. Each

student varies greatly. ' '

— Sherry Brown

Director of C GS Registration

CGS was the logical place to go to
sample Pitt, according to Emry. ”The
CGS people made the transition
easy,” Emry said. ”They transferred
more of my credits from IUP than
CAS would have, and they make it
easy to register and start taking
courses right away.”

Emry also said the flexibility of the
CGS currriculum made it easier to
adapt to a new university. ”The ma-
jor programs are designed to be more
adaptable to someone in my situa-
tion,” she said. ”I was able to use a

that.”

Robinson does not see the move as
a sacrifice of educational quality.
”I’ve attended both CGS and CAS
classes before and they were about
the same, except some of the day
classes are larger,” he said.

Nancy George, a CGS student, is
a Councilwoman in the CGS Student
Government and also works in the
CGS registration office. ”There’s a lot
more personal attention in the even-'
ing college," she said. ”Our advisors
and registration people are able to

answer personal questions and take
time to help more because we only
register night students here.” _'

Eighty percent of CGS students
work full-time, and the average age
is 25, according to Comfort.

Dave Gregg is 25, has a full-time
job and recently enrolled at CGS for
the fall semester. Gregg works as a

systems specialist for General E|ec— -

tric, hoping to move on to computer
programming and software develop-‘
ment with the help of a computer
science degree from CGS. ’’I picked
CGS because it's convenient,” said

Gregg. ”I work in Pittsburgh and it's - A

Gregg also said he picked CGS.

Continued from page 3

The current president of the IFC,
Jeff Maffe, said that he can see why

’ the Office of Student Activities acted

as they did. ”I’m sure they had a lot
of pressure on them,” Maffe said.
"Dry rush is the new national trend
and most of the major universities
have it. They [student activities] ask-

1 ed some of our nationals what they

thought of dry rush and they received
positive responses. '
"There was a meeting held a while
back and the presidents of the frater-
nities were invited," said Maffe.
"Nasos Georgiadis [the previous IFC
president] encouraged people not to

go. I mean, it's not his fault, they still
could have gone, _but only a few
did.”

Maffe is optimistic that this year's
dry rush will not bring about a signifi-
cant decrease in the number of peo-
ple who attend the rush functions.

"|t should go pretty well depending
on what each fraternity puts into it,"
said Maffe. "lt's not just beer here;
it's the brotherhood.”

Many of the brothers from the
fraternities are voicing the same op-
timism. ”The people who are going
to come to the parties are going to
come regardless of the alcohol,” said
Flash. ”It will probably just weed out

Triangle brother Mike Rusnock also
does not forsee enrollment decreases
due, to the dry rush. "A good many
of our pledges are friends of people
in the fraternity. A lot of us recruit that
way,” said Rusnock. ”The problem
will probably be up on the hill.
Before, people would just go up to
the hill and go from-party to party."

Then there are those who do an-
ticipate problems. Phi Kappa Alpha
brother Kevin Burns said that his
fraternity has always been one of the
top in getting people signed. ”We're
just going to have to wait to see how
things go,” said Burns, "but I would
think that there will be a decrease.

The parties do bring a lot of people
up who have no intention of joining
the fraternity. The parties do change
some of their minds.”

Trexler was one such person.
"When I first came here my friends
and I were very anti-fraternity. Then
when I went to some of the parties
I changed my mind. People have a
preconceived notion that they don't
want to pay for their friends. I
wouldn't have come to parties to sit
around and talk to the guys.

"There’s no arguing the fact that
drinking underage"is illegal but it's
going to happen,” ‘said Trexler.

the drinkers.”

Study

Continued from page 20
I don't want the results,’ the other 50 percent haven't responded at
all.’' Lyter said those who choose not to receive results most likely
do so out of fear of a positive test for the antibody. There is no cure
for AIDS.

Ron, a 24-year-old student at Pitt, has been with the study for the
past two years. ”I'm not afraid of it, because I can control myself. I'm
more depressed about it. I wish it would go away,” he said. "We can't
control it, there's no cure, but I'm confident I won't get AIDS.

"I really was terrified for a while about it," he said. "A friend of
mine in New York had died from it. It just got very scary.”

Lyter said the study is not required to give out results to subjects,
but it does not mean they aren't available/‘It is somewhat frustrating
to have these results available and then not have the men come in
to find out,” he said. ”Seventy-five percent of the men are healthy and
negative and that's good news to tell them. A quarter of them have
been exposed, however, and my personal feeling is that the men should

 Lyter said. the freedom not to know the results is part of what keeps
‘men coming to the study. - A

The HIV virus itself is not deadly. Part of what the study hopes
to determine is why certain men contract the disease, while others carry
the virus without any adverse affects. None of the three The Pitt News

‘spoke with are carrying the virus. All three have chosen.to remain in

thestudy though it has been determined they are not HIV carriers.

Every six months theyare given a complete physical and have blood

and body fluid tests taken. .

Tom, a 21-year-old double major at Pitt, participates in the study
to ease the concern of his family.

"I guess it was late last year, in fact it was during Christmas break,
I went home and told my parents and the rest of my family I was gay,”

he said. "They were very concerned that I might have or get AIDS.
At that point I joined the study to prove I [did] not have it.

”I also started to feel sensitive to their cause. I read in Out magazine
[a local publication for homosexuals] that they were having trouble

‘with the study — getting the people to stay in it and come to the ap-

pointments, and the study was kind of in danger because of that.”

All three said they were encouraged by others to join the study and
now urge other homosexuals to join. ”That’s our main recruitment
tool, really,” said Lyter. "We've spent thousands of dollars on adver-
tising and all sorts of ’gimmicks,' if you will. But, when we ask people
how they found out about the study, and why they decided to join,
finding out from a friend and being encouraged by a friend is still No.
1.".

Fear and concern motivate the men to encourage others to join the
study. _

"I do have friends who have AIDS and I don't treat them any dif-
ferently from any of my other friends. They go through some real rough
times,” said John. "They need as much support as possible because
they realize as of yet there is no cure. They are dying."

”I’ve never known anybody directly who's had it," said Tom. "But

I . , Ihave friends who have known people who had it and in fact had
I diedfrom it. The way it's spreading so rapidly, that's very frightening.”

Though the study examines only homosexualand bisexual males,
Kingsley said it is impoitant to remember AIDS is not confined to them.
"I think early on there was a high amount of fear and prejudice

directed against the homosexual and bisexual community.” he said. I

"|t’s unfair to blame homosexuals; women and children also have the
disease.”

Researchers. say they are several years away from developing a vac-
cine. Until then, the Pitt Men's Study will continue to test and educate
homosexual and bisexual males.

"There is a whole realm‘ of neurological effects and psychological

ects which we have no idea about,” said Lyter. " We're also look-

at the effect of the virus on the motor system and mental status.”
on has considered leaving the study, fearing what may happen
should his homosexuality be revealed. -

"There are so many zealous factions in this country now,” said Ron.
"If you're gay, it's like you're not sensitive."

"‘!-O1 .__»

This also is a common argument
against having a dry rush. "How
many underage people are there in
the bars?" asked Yurgel. ”And how
many people drink in theirdorm
rooms? If somebody gets trashed at
the frat parties we shut them down.
Nobody hardly drives to the parties
and most people don't get that
messed up anyways. They're here to
meet people.”

According to Smith, it's not just the
parties during rush that have to abide
by the law, but all the parties
throughout the year are required not
to serve alcohol to those underage.

"We realize there are a lot of peo-
ple in fraternities who are 2I," said
Smith, "but if we find out that there
are other people drinking underage
we will take action. Those things do
happen; it happened maybe four
times last year."

Regardless of the controversy sur-
rounding dry rush, all the fraternities
said they are now trying to make the
best of it. '

”Rush registration is free this year,
unlike last year,” said Medica. "Sept.
I is the official kick-off with a
watermelon picnic on the cathedral
lawn and ”Meet the Greeks" is the
big thing on Wednesday in the
William Pitt Union Assembly Room.
There will be representatives from all
the fraternities there. We've also been
in contact with Seven Springs Ski
Resort about having a ski-weekend
raffle. We're hoping that the in-
dividual events the fraternities are
sponsoring will also help this year."

But not all fraternities are planning
on there being a big difference this
year. "I don't really see all that much
changing," said Rusnock. "This year
we're having things like cookouts,
softball games, movie nights, and a
Vegas night.

Most of the fraternities are planning
more . events than they have in
previous years in hopes of gaining the

- interest of prospective pledges.

Accordingto Smith, the successof
dry rush depends on what the frater-
nities make of _it. ”Some of the frater-
nities, who at the very beginning said

‘OK, this is going to be real and we'll

go along with it-, they will do good,"
said Smith. ”Those who bitched and
moaned all along will be the ones to
suffer."

r THE PITT NEWS, Friday, August 29, 1986

Freeman

Continued from page 7 6
When Tony Dorsett got here in
1973 Pitt was recognized as a na-
tional football power. Has that
helped Pitt?

Freeman: Oh, sure it has.
During the period from the mid-'60’s
to the early ’70’s, our football for-
tunes had really waned. Football was
costing us a great deal of money at
the time. We didn't have any atten-
dance and we weren't taking advan-
tage of what was at that time a
growing market for television. So, it
was costing us a lot of money.

We were at the point in 1971
where the university either had to
give up football or we had to get in-
to it in the same way most other
research universities are doing. It's in-
teresting to note that the biggest and
best research universities and
graduate institutions in the country in
the public sector also tend to be the
biggest and best football powers.
There's no inconsistency between
those two things.

At that time the decision was made
to hire Johnny Majors and he was for-
tunate enough to recruit Tony Dorsett
and some other outstanding players.
It certainly has elevated, at least in
Pennsylvania, the support for the in-
stitution.

It has generated a lot of private giv-
ing. to that program as well as to the
rest of the university. Certainly I think
that the restoration of the strength and
national standing of the athletics pro-
gram at the university has been an
important part of our effort to elevate
the general reputation and national

T standing of the institution.

The Pitt News: In 1985, Dr.
Thomas Starzl was recognized for his
work in transplants. What sort of ef-
fect has that had?

Freeman: I think there is little ques-
tion that our transplant program is the
leading one in the whole world,
thanks to Dr. Starzl and Henry
Bahnson and their colleagues; It cer-
tainly has focused a great deal of at-
tention on the university.

There has been some unfavorable
publicity about certain aspects of that
program but, by and large, I think that
it is widely regarded as a fine.pro-
gram. Certainly it has reflected most
favorably on the University of Pitts-
burgh, on the participating hospitals
and on the city of Pittsburgh as a
center for this kind of very exciting
medical procedure.

The Pitt News: Also in 1985, The
Campus of the Future was estab-
lished, although still in the process of
completion. How much of a dif-
ferencedoes it make?

Freeman: Well, I think it
represented not only a marvelous op-
portunity for the University of Pitts-
burgh to greatly improve our
computing and communication and
instructional capabilities here, but it
also represents a kind of partnership
between a major corporate entity like
AT&T and a major research univer-
sity like Pitt that is beneficial to both.

It has not only given us an
outstanding way of dealing with
some of those technical issues, but it
has also done so in a way that has
brought national attention to us, and

‘has permitted us to do that at costs

that are much less than would have
been the’ case if we sould have just
tried to go out and buy those things
on our own. Certainly, it's given us
a lot of national publicity and that
will be important to us.

Everywhere I go, across the nation,
people come up and ask me about
The Campus of the Future. So, it cer-
tainly has enhanced the university's
reputation both in the corporate sec-
tor and in the field of higher
education

The Pitt News: In‘ the last year or
so, the supercomputer has arrived.
What does that mean for us?

Freeman: Perhaps more than
anything else that's happened in the
last two or three years, the supercom-
puter has enhanced the university's
standing as a leader nationally in the

1: ,‘field oftcomputing and those scien-

- ~~-'-:.:' '-I-- ‘

tific activities that are dependent
upon this kind of supercomputing.

We're only one of five centers in
the whole country that is funded by
the National Science Foundation and
that's pretty elite company. Certain-
ly I think that it's vitally important to
us substantively, quite apart from the
public perception. It gives our facul-
ty as well as other researchers in the
Pittsburgh region ready access to a
resource which is not readily
available in most locales.

So, it's going to greatly strengthen
our abiltity to utilize supercomputing
in advanced scientific and mathe-
matical research.

The Pitt News: A lot of the events
important to Pitt in the past have
been based on individuals that have
achieved success in whatever they're
working in. In the next 10 years or
so, do you think there are any par-
ticular areas that Pitt would achieve

success in? _
Freeman: Oh, yes. I think there's

little question that there are several
areas in which we're going to see
some important breakthroughs in the
future. One of which would be in the
area of biotechnology.

We're moving toward the
establishment of a large effort in that
direction with some state funding and
with some strong research support
from a variety of sources. '

I think in other areas such as
materials research and surface
science where we have very strong
suits. In biological sciences and cer-

a lot of movement among deans and

I think the university is going to be
recognized as we move ahead to
Harmarville and the area of applied
research as a center for interfacing the
university's research capabilities with
the needs of industry. I forsee that that
is likely to be an area of great impor-
tance to the university in the future.

going to grow a great deal stronger
over the next 10 years. It's going to
be a very exciting time in the life of
the university.

The Pitt News: What is an

at this time getting that a student was

Freeman: First of all, I think, great-
ly improved academic strength.

There's no question in my mind
that this is a better university as a
teaching institution than it was 15 or
20 years ago. We've been able,

through the successes, to attract to"
this institution some of the best and .

How I spent my

summer vacation

By John Enright
Assistant Sports Editor

Most collegiate basketball players
spend the summer months sharpen-
ing their skills on the asphalt courts
under the grueling heat of the sun.

Some work on their defense.
Others on theirdribbling and pass-
ing skills. Some try to improve their
scoring and rebounding capabilities.

Whatever their focus may be, all
players spend endless hours on the
courts with the goal of improvement
on their minds —— that little extra edge
that will take a player beyond his or
her natural talents to a higher level
of play.

Pitt basketball player Charles Smith
did the same thing this past July.

But Smith wasn't seeking improve-
ment in any specific area of his game,
though he has a few weaknesses.
Rather, he concentrated on only one
thing, playing with confidence on his

‘summer hoop team, the U.S. Na-

tional Team, which competed in the
World Basketball Championships in
Madrid, Spain.

The 6-10 junior was coming off a
disappointing sophomore season for
the mediocre Panthers. He fell short
of fans’ expectations, even though
those hopes were a bit exaggerated.

Smith agrees. ”People were expect-

ing so much more because of my
freshman year. I didn't think I played
that bad, it's just that everyone was
expecting so much. And I can't
blame them for doing that,” com-
mented Smith.

Still, he wasn’t the same player as
he was his freshman year when he
garnered Big East Rookie-of-the-Year
honors. I

But the results of Smith's summer
hoop trip to Spain reinforced in
many’s minds just why Pitt fans ex-
pect so much from ”Mr. Fluid.”

The so-called experts gave the

_ United States little chance of making

the gold-medal round of the 24—team
tournament. But on July 20, the final
day of competition, the Americans
won the gold, defeating the favored
Russians 87-85 — Charles Smith had
arrived as the team’s leading scorer
(15 points per game).

Quite an ironic turn of events for
Smith, who almost was not invited to
the June final tryouts for the squad in
Tucson, Ariz.

Smith was originally selected as
one of 47 players vying for the 12
roster spots. on the team. But he
couldn't make the original tryout in
Colorado because of a scheduling
conflict.

He petitioned the U.S. coaching
staff for another chance, but hea

S

coach Lute Olson and his staff de-
clined. Then’ Kansas’ Danny Mann-
ing withdrew because of a knee
injury. Smith had his chance, and he
made the most of it.

But it wasn't easy.

”I had to do everything extra hard
[at the tryouts],” said Smith. ”They
didn't push me too m_uch. "It was like
I was more or less pushing myself
because I was still out of shape.

’’I played real well in the practices.
We were practicing for two weeks,
two times a day, but I had an injury
that set me back. It came at a pretty
bad time,” added Smith.

It was an injury that almost kept
him off the squad, but when the team
flew overseas for the tournament,
Smith was on the plane, although that
didn't guarantee him any playing
time. He had to prove himself first.
And that was a tough chore with

talented players such as Navy's.

David Robinson, UNLV’s Armon
Gilliam and Syracuse’s Rony Seika-
ly occupying spots on the U.S. squad.
But it didn't take the multi-
dimensional Pitt star long to adjust.

know how much I would be play-
ing,” commented Smith. ”We played
an exhibition game in France, and I
came off the bench and had about 30
points. From then on I started.”
And scored! Twenty pointsin the
opening game victory against Ivory
Coast; 28 against West Germany; 18
against Canada; and 17 against the
Russians. Ah, yes, the Russians.

we weren't playing so well, and the
Russians looked tough on the
highlights,” Smith said. ”So we didn't
know if we could beat them. But after
we kept winning, we had a positive
attitude that we could do it. And we
did.”

Thanks to the strong, consistent
play of Pitt's premier hooper, a
young, inexperienced U.S. ‘team
showed the world who is No. 1 in
basketball.

After the tournament concluded,
Smith was asked if the key for his
own success —- confidence — had
grown.

”Yes. The tournament helped me
out a lot because coming off last year
things were looking pretty bad," said
Smith.

That is no longer true. The tourna-
ment showed the world that Charles
Smith can play. He is one of the best
college players in the country.
Understandably, even the soft-
spoken Smith wasn't surprised by his
fine performance in Spain.

’’I know how well I can play. I
know what type of player I am,”
Smith said. ’’I can get motivated
when I'm playing against the kind of
caliber players I was playing against.
So I went out there and played hard,
and everything fell into place.”

The 1986-87 season should be an
interesting one for the Panthers. The
team has good players in Jerome

A 7'4’ Congemi

as /Cstar

By Jim U rban
Editor-in-Chief

It was a cold November evening
when John Congemi last removed a
Pitt game jersey from his tired body.

\_ The Panthers had just been embar-
"5 rassed by archrival Penn State 31-0
in front of a national television au-
dience and a sold-out Pitt Stadium

crowd of 60,134. The Nittany Lions’

would go on and play for the Na-

tional Championship in the Orange

Bowl against ,Oklahoma. The Pan-

thers would lose their head coach

that following Monday.

Congemi sat in front of his locker
with a very disillusioned look on his
face. Reporters fired questions at him,’

 but Congemi had no answers. Time

‘T  and again, Congemi shook his head
' and said in a soft voice, ’’I don't know
what happened.”

,A victim of nagging injuries and
perhaps an incompetent offensive
coordinator, Congemi had just seen
his football career hit a new low. The
possibility of being able to go back
and change the way his senior year
transpired never occured to him.
Regardless, he would jump at the
chance if the opportunity presented

 itself. _

Santa Claus came early for John
Congemi. The ”senior” from Lauder-
dale Lakes, F|a., petitioned the NCAA
this past spring for an extra year of

eligibility. He had injured his wrist ‘

in a JV game his freshman year and
never saw action that season in a var-

sity game. That meant, as far as the
NCAA is concerned, he had only
played three years of football, all of
which time he was Pitt's starting
quarterback. The NCAA reviewed the
case and gave Congemi the thumbs-
up sign just before spring ball was
about to get under way. Congemi
had his opportunity; the choice was
his. He opted to return for another

. senior year.

”One of the main reasons I came
back was because I was not satisfied
with the way things ended up last
year,” Congemi said. The memory of
Penn-State and other Pitt losses dur-
ing the past two seasons remain fresh
in his mind. ’’If you were going to
write a book about the Pitt football
team, you could finish it a lot better
than the way we finished last year.
This is just a chance for me to go back
and change a few things.”

Basically, that means winning,
something the Panthers have not
done consistently" the past two
seasons. While Pitt's prospects of
winning do look reasonably better,
for Congemi some things never
change. Ever since, he first entered the
Pitt quarterback picture during his
sophomore season, nothing has

come easy. He has had to battle for
his starting spot.

In 1983, Congemi was not even ex-
pected to play. He entered fall camp
as the No. 3 quarterback on Pitt's
depth chart, but two games into the
season he was the starting quarter-
back, thanks in part to an injury to
then-starter John Cummings.

Congemi led the Panthers to a 7-4
record as he passed for 1,940 yards
while completing just under 60 per-
cent of his passes. Pitt lost to Ohio
State in the Fiesta Bowl, but Congemi
was named the Most Valuable Player,
completing 31 passes for 361 yards.

In 1984, incoming freshman Dante
Wiley, since departed for Nebraska,
declared himself the starting quarter-
back before Pitt even entered fall
camp. Congemi won the job going
away, but the Panthers faltered,

~ finishing with a 3-7-1 record. Con-

gemi was nagged by injuries and
threw for only 1,102 yards while
completing 53 percent of his passes.

Last season did not get any easier.
Following the disappointing 1984
campaign, cries of ”Felitsky” were
heard from the Pitt following, refer-
ing to back-up Joe Felitsky, a product
of Pittsburgh's Central Catholicand

  

**'*********‘k

a transfer from Notre Dame. Con-
gemi weathered the storm once again
and kept the starting job. This time
he was trapped inside offensive coor-
dinator Chuck Stobart’s unadaptive
system. The result was an inconsis-
tent offensive unit. Congemi passed
for 1,377 yards and completed 50
percent of his passes as the Panthers
finished 5-5-1. . '

One would figure a three-year
starter would be a lock to start dur-
ing his senior year — guess again.

Enter Sal Genilla, a record-setting,
junior college transfer. Gone is
Stobart and his ex-boss Foge Fazio in
favor of new Pitt head coach Mike
Gottfried, whose middle name, some
say, is ”pass.”.

Gottfried has made it clear that
Congemi will have to win his job
once again.

”Coach Gottfried told me from the
first day after I knew I was going to
have an extra year of eligibility that
I would have to win the job outright,”
Congemi said. ”That makes sense
because he is only going to have me
for one year. He is going to have the
other guys [Genilla and blue-chip
freshman‘ Larry Wanke] for a lot
longer, so it would be to his advan-

Genilla

tage to play someone else. Hopeful-
ly, I can make it a tough decision for
him.”

Gottfried has stressed that ultimate-

ly the starting quarterback will be '

either Genilla or Congemi, with Felit-
sky and Wanke fighting it out for the
third spot.

_ ’’It will probably come out of [Con-
gemi and Geni|la],” Gottfried said.
"Both of them have worked very-
hard this summer, and they are ready
for the challenge -ahead.”

Genilla is the most prolific passer
in junior college history. A straight
dropback passer, he holds-the JC
records for most yards passing in a
season (3,556), most yards total of-
fense in a season (3,607), pass com-
pletions in a season (224) and
touchdowns responsible for (42).

’’If you want the stronger arm,”

Gottfried said, ”you have to go with.

Sal Genilla. But if you are talking-
about experience, John Congemi has

more experience. There is a lot of off- ‘

setting. It really depends on who per-
forms right now."

Both Congemi and*Genilla, regard-
less of who starts, will benefit from
Gottfried's tutelage. He was a
quarterback in college at'Morehead.

State and is a highly respected offen- V

sive coach.

Gottfried has been called in by
several NFL teams, including the
Dallas Cowboys, to help improve
their passing game.

’’I call the offensive plays,” Gott-

The Pitt

 

By John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

3 Editor's note: On Monday night
the Pitt Panthers open the 7986 foot-
ball season against the Maryland Ter-
rapins at Pitt Stadium. The game will
mark the debut of Mike Gottfried, the
30th head coach in Pitt's illustrious
football history.

Gottfried, formerly head coach of

I Kansas, is taking over a troubled pro-

gram, one that is in dire need of
direction. The Panthers have strug-
gled to an 8-12-2 record the past two

g years, but, more importantly, some

players have failed to act like mature
students, as numerous players have
been involved in fights on campus.
Pitt's new coach knows that the
task of putting the Panther football
team back where it belongs, among
the nation's elite, is a difficult one.
"We are in a dogfight here,” said
Gottfried. Although he is cautious,
Gottfried displays an air of extreme
confidence, something which should
soon carry over to his players.
This summer I stopped by
Gottfried’s office on a rather hectic
Monday afternoon. We sat and talked
about the Pitt football program.

Q: Pittsburgh is a very different city
than Lawrence, Kan. What do you
th.ink of Pittsburgh from what you
have seen?

"As far as disci-
pline and rules go,
our players know
what to expect.
We're asking a lot of
them, but we feel
they should be team-
oriented and handle
themselves well as
student-a thIetes.' I
— Mike Gottfried

A: I love Pittsburgh, and I love the
challenge here at Pitt. I'm looking for-
ward to being a part of this football

program.

plagued by a lack of discipline when
you took the job?

A: I found that we have pretty good
people here. I'm impressed with our
players and the kind of people they
are. Of course isolated incidents can
give you a bad reputation. You can
build up a good reputation in five or
six years, but one bad incident can
tear it down. And that happens.

Q: Have the players adjusted to
your style of coaching?

A: I think they have, but we're still
in a transition period. They don't
know what to expect until we go into
the season and play a game. A"

Eventually we'll have a great rela-
tionship with our players because

our players know what to expect.
We're asking a lot of them, but we
feel they should’ be team-oriented
and handle themselves well as
student-athletes.

Q: How do you feel about your
coaching staff? ,

A: I have a great staff. They are a
very loyal group, not just to Mike
Gottfried, but to the University of
Pittsburgh. They're hard working
people. Everywhere I go, people say
how impressed they are with my staff.

Q: The opener with Maryland and
the Temple game will both be played
at night, Pitt's third and fourth home
night games in the last two seasons.
Are permanent lights in the future
plans for Pitt Stadium? '

A: The athletic department is look-

ing into that. When you have a night
game and you bring in MUSCO, [the
company that supplies stadiums with
temporary lights] it takes away from
your TV money. So, I think it is
something which will be strongly
considered.

Q: What about an indoor practice
facility? A -

A: That is something we need a
Pitt, although a lot of people may
view it as a fringe benefit and not a
necessity.

I had the indoor field my last year
at Kansas. It not only helped our foot-
ball team, but also our tennis,
volleyball, baseball and track teams.
The indoor facility gives everybody
a chance to improve their skills in
bad weather. .

It's something that a lot of athletic

Q: Are you pushing for an indoor

everyone agrees on that.

always felt that you take thetalent
you have and fit it into a system that's
best for it.

Q: A lack of overall team-speed has
been quite apparent on Pitt teams of
recent years. Do you agree?

A: Yes and no. Team-speed and
quickness is definitely a concern, but
we have some people who can run.

But overall team speed is something

we need to improve on.

Q: Do you feel there is a lack of

quantity at the running back positionij,

A: When I came hereeverybody
told me that running back was the
strength of the ballclub. But really,
we have only four experienced
backs. Other than those four, there
will be some’ young people behind
them. So we have to stay healthy and
consistent in the backfield.

Q: How do you feel about Craig
Heyward?
A: He works'hard. He enjoys play-

ing. He's one of the first football ‘

"

players I've ever seen play with av T

smile on his face all the time. He
definitely enjoys playing between the
lines. ‘

Q: Heyward, Charles Gladman,
and Tom Brown are three very
talented backs. How do you plan on
keeping them all happy?

A: They'll all play. You can never
get by with just one back. We might
move Heyward to fullback with Tom-

my Brown. And I'm not opposed tag,-

trying some wishbone offense with
all three backs in there at the same
time. ‘

Q: Were you satisfied with your
first recruiting class at Pitt, consider-
ing the late start you and your staff
had?

A: I don't like to‘ use the word:
satisfied. Our recruiting class was
good, but by no meansrwas it where
it would have been ifl had been here
for a year. But I wouldn't trade any
of the kids I have.

Q: Any goals for the year?

A: I set goals. I'm excited and I
know the expectation level is high at
Pitt. There has been so much success
here that I would like to be successful
right away. But it's tough to say
where we stand right now.

We're coming off two lackluster
years. Now, it's a matter of whether
we're willing to pay the price to get
back up there, and, of course, our
schedule is tough. We have a chance
to be a good team, but if we're not
ready to play, we could be not so‘
good.

But the only goal I've set is for us
to playhard, play disciplined and
play unselfishly. That's all you can
ask your team to do. If you do that

_ the wins will take care of themselves.

Out of the Woods ..

Panther defensive ‘end emerges
as prime A|l—America candidate

Bylohn Ennght
Assistant Sports Editor

Tony Woods came to Pitt three
years ago, a Parade All-America

linebacker from Seton Hall Prep in
Newark, NJ.

He was heavily recruited by na-
tional powers Penn State, Notre
Dame, Michigan, USC and
Nebraska. But he chose‘ Pitt, prompt-
ing many people to call him "the
next Hugh Green.”

But after Woods’ sophomore
season he had done little to inspire
comparisons to Pitt's legendary
defensive end.

In fact, the 6-4, 240-pound senior
had only played in eight games after
his first two seasons with the Pan-
thers, recording only three sacks and
40 tackles. Not exactly Hugh Green-
type numbers.

But this wasn't the case of a high
school star who couldn't cut it in the
major college game. Tony Woods
has the talent. '

Rather, this was the story of a great
athlete who couldn't get his chance
on the college gridiron because he
was constantly plagued by nagging
injuries.

PLAYFAIR  
IS COMING    

You’ve just been invited to the
greatest party of all time.

Don’t even thinkabout it —

Woods broke his ankle against
Navy his freshmen year, the injury
still bothered him throughout his
sophomore campaign.

But the 1985 season was a different
story. Woods was healthy throughout
the year and was undoubtedly Pitt's
best defensive player, recording 93
tackles, 20 of those for lost yardage,
and 15 sacks.

Now, Woods is a tri-captain on the
1986 edition of the Panthers. His
stellar play last season has caught the

nation's attention, as Woods is a pre- T

season first team All-America accord-
ing to Game Plan and Playboy
magazines.

Gil Brandt, vice president of the ‘

Dallas Cowboys, is a big fan of Pitt's
premier defensive player. ”‘He’s a
great competitor, and he can
dominate play,” said Brandt. ’’I think
Tony is an excellent football player.”

Brandt isn't the only one. Frank
D’Alonzo is Woods’ defensive end
coach at Pitt. He came to the Pan-
thers last December to join Mike
Gottfried’s staff. D’Alonzo had only
a few weeks in spring ball to evaluate
Woods and came away more than
impressed.

”Tony is one of the hardest workers
and one of the best players on the
team. He enjoys the game,” said
D’Alonzo. ”He exemplifies best what
the Pitt defense is all about.”

”Natura||y, he doesn't get all the
attention some other players receive
because Pitt hasn't done so well the
last two years, but Tony is one of the
best defensive players in the coun-
try.”

Indeed, very high praise for
Woods, who must live up to his press
clippings if the '86 Panthers are to get
back on the winning track. And, win-
ning is all that matters to Woods.

’’I think we definitely had the talent
to be a Top 10 team the past two
years. The problem was a combina-
tion of things,” commented Woods.

”lt seemed like we could never
find the right team chemistry, and we
never had any luck. To go to a bowl
game you have to have a certain
amount of luck, and we didn't have
any. Plus, there was a lack of
discipline on the team.”

Discipline has most assuredly been
a problem for the Pitt football team
the last two seasons. Some players
have had as many troubles off the
field as on "it.

But, whatever the case may be,
Woods won't knock his former coach
Foge Fazio.

”Winning is contagious, but so is
|osing,” said Woods. ”Once you start
to lose, you start to blame things on
each other. So I don't think you can
blame things that happened on
Coach Fazio and his staff.”

But, while Woods has nothing
negative to say about Fazio, he
doesn't seem to want to talk about
him either. That is because Fazio
represents the past. Woods is only
concerned with the future —- the
future is Mike Gottfried.

’’I’m very impressed with Coach

' Gottfried because he came in and

gave us discip|jne,” commented
Woods. ”Some players didn't realize
that he means business. He came in
and felt he had to make some
changes.”

Changes, such as abandoning Pitt's
5-2 defensive system for the 4-3, a
move that should benefit Woods,
whose strength is rushing the passer.

’’I’m happy with the system. The
4-3 is more of an aggressive defense.
Most of the time l’ll be rushing the

‘ quarterback,” added Woods, whose

15 sacks last season amount to the
most by a Panther since 1980 when
Green had 17.

While Pitt continued to be one of
the best teams in the nation against
the run last year (seventh in the na-
tion), the Panthers gave up a stagger-
ing amount of yardage through the air
(2,283 yards to be exact, an infamous
Pitt record).

This needs to be improved drasti-
cally if Pitt hopes to have one of the
better defensive units in the country.
And nobody knows that more than
Woods.

’'I feel we have an opportunity to
be ranked in the top three in the
country in‘ total defense," said
Woods. "But we need a couple of
things to fall into place. The secon-
dary has to play well together. If all
the players do the same, we will have
that opportunity."

And how far does Tony Woods feel
the team can go this season?

’’If everything falls right we could
go to a major bowl game. But we're
going to concentrate on winning
eight games,” said Woods. ”Our
main goal is to go to a bowl game,
but our ultimate goal is to go to a ma-
jor bowl.” - —

If the Panthers are to reach those
heights they will need an extraor-
dinary effort from the defense. And
Coach D’Alonzo knows who will be
the main man on the Pitt ”D."

"Every great defense takes on the
personality of one player — and Tony
Woods is that player,” added
D’Alonzo.

THE PITT News, Friday, August 29, 1986

.,,ACC champ Maryland

looking to rebuild in '86

Pitt opens the 1986 football season
with a nationally televised night
game against Maryland on Labor Day
at Pitt Stadium. Playing the Terrapins
on opening night 1986 should be
considerably easier than playing
them opening night of last year
would have been. In Maryland's
opener last season Penn State won
only because of a Maryland turnover
with less than two minutes to play in
the game.

Last year's Terrapins were picked
by Sport Magazine as preseason na-
tional champs, a position they held
only until the end of the Penn State
game.

While far from being national
champs, Maryland did put together
a fine 9-3 season including an im-
pressive 35-18 win over Syracuse in
the Cherry Bowl. After last season
however, the Terps were devastated
by graduation. Now they are without
long-time quarterback Stan-Cielbaugh
and without the services of the ”Beef
Brothers,” the nickname given to four
Maryland offensive linemen.

The bulk of an already strong
defense returns and, with another full
season under their belts, Maryland
defenders figure to be even better

even more scant when senior Matt

”We’re thin, but we have some
people there who can be-successful,”

g Cottfried said. ”We’re thin only in
 terms of numbers. But I think

whoever starts there will be young
and inexperienced.”

Scales, a converted tailback, led the
Panthers with 34 receptions for 446
yards last season. Williams and
Stewart had 21 catches between
them. Much is expected from

Brasco fiasco.

Mark Brasco, a junior placekicker,
attempted 1-4 field goals last season
— he made five and missed nine.
Although Fazio had a perplexing pro-
blem with the kicking game, Gott-
fried may have corrected it by
recruiting freshman Jeff Van Home
from Cheney, Wash.

Before" departing for Edinboro,
Gottfried touted Van Horne, con-
sidered one of the top five kickers on
the West Coast last season, among
his most promising freshmen. Brasco
entered camp as the projected starter,

Bias cocaine trial and may be
declared ineligible by game time. But
at the present time he is planning to
play, and that could be bad news for
the revamped Pitt passing attack.

On offense the biggest problem is
how to replace Gelbaugh. Coach
Bobby Ross agrees. "We need to set-
tle on a starting quarterback quickly
in order to prepare for the opener
against Pittsburgh,” said Ross. Any
one of four candidates — none of
whom have ever played a down in
college football — could win the job.
The decision probably won't be
reached until the week before the Pitt
game.

if Maryland can find a decent
quarterback they could very well
wind up with a terrific passing game.
Last year's two best receivers, Ziz
Abdur-Ra’oofand James Milling will
again be the primary ‘wide outs. The
two combined last season for over
1,000 yard receiving.

Maryland will live and die with the
defense in 1986. lfthey can hold the
opposition to under three touch-
downs a game, and keep the Terps
from being blown out, Maryland may
find rebuilding an offense need not
be such a painful experience.

but assistant coach Chuck Klausing
had high praise for Van Horne.

”Jeff has an extremely live leg,”
Klausing said. ”l:lis kickoffs average
about 65 yards and he is an excellent
placekicker, extremely accurate
within the 50-yard range. He's real-
ly talented.”

0 You're in for typically strong
defense; now all Pjtt needs is some
offense. ”

Defensive ends Tony Woods, a
senior, and Burt Grossman, a
sophomore, will have more pass-
rushing responsibilities this season.
Pitt forsakes its traditional 5-2
defense. The 4-3 defense places
either Lorenzo Freeman, Walter
Johnson or Tony Siragusa at tackles,

Pitt takes its show on the road for

. the first time in 1986 with a road

game at North Carolina State
September 13. The Wolfpack will be

i ‘Pitt's second consecutive game with

an Atlantic Coast Conference school.

The Panthers are giving themselves

~ a -two-week layoff between the
S Maryland and NC State games, and

they will probably need every minute
to prepare for the aerial exploits of

V the Wolfpack offense.

Like Pitt, State has a new head

7 Coach. He is Dick Sheridan, a former

Division II coach of the year. Unlike
Pitt, the Wolfpack has a quarterback
they know they can count on.

Erik Kramer, a potential All-
America and a certain All-East per-

‘ former, set new Wolfpack passing
records in four categories last season.

He set new marks for most yards in
a season (2,510), total . offense
_-(2,252), touchdown passes (16) and

. passing attempts (339).

And if that weren't enough, Kramer
carries a 3.36 GPA in pre-med.

”Erik possesses all the qualities you
want in a quarterback," Sheridan said
of the three-time letter winner. ”He

-'13 has intelligence, he's a leader, he's

an excellent athlete, and he's an ex-
tremely hard worker.”

wide receivers, though, and State

fried said. ’’I always have and I
always will. I am good at what I do.
I've been doing it for 20 years."

. Many experts believe that Pitt's
problems over the past two years
stem from the offensive scheme. Two
different offensive coordinators in the

' past two years, Stobart last year and

Joe Moore in 1984, ran offenses that
were not very condusive to the per-
sonel Pitt had on its roster. That will

. change this year.

Kramer can look to tight end Ralph

Dwight Frazier.

The defensive secondary will be
another Wolfpack strong point.
Nelson Jones, a three starter at safe-
ty, is back for his final season at NC
State. Jones should be familiar to Pitt
fans — he had seven tackles in last
year's game. Free safety Michael

freedom, and that was the thing I
disagreed with because sometimes
you have to do things on the spur of
the moment out there — you can't

"This will be the fourth offensive

gemi added, ”and this probably rates
with the best of them. Ron Turner

Beyond that N.C. State is in trou-
ble. The offensive line is extremely
inexperienced, and no real game-

breaker has yet emerged at running
back.

The Wolfpack is another team in
transition. More than a dozen players
are at new positions this year. The
Wolfpack possesses excellent skill
players, and to have a successful
season the Pack will have to out-
finesse rather than out-muscle.‘

N.C. State has a long way to go to
improve its program, but Coach
Sheridan is confident they will.‘

”Our goal is to have the best pro-
gram in the ACC — and that's quite
a challenge when you consider the
strength of the conference — but
that's our goal,” said Sheridan. ”lt’s
important to have success, but we
want to go about it in the proper way.
We'll have-pride in our program, and
we will conduct it within the NCAA
rules.

”To build this type of situation, we
need the true student-athletes at N.C.

State. We'll be recruiting the young.

men who are looking for an educa-
tion, and are ready to use football as
a means to provide that education,”

4 added Sheridan. ‘

Sheridan sounds extremely confi-

to now. Coach Gottfried compli-
ments a lot of things Turner did, only
this offense now is much more vast."
Congemi remembers vividly the of-
fensively powerful Pitt teams he
watched when he was being
recruited — the Jackie Sherrill
coached squads that continually
finished ranked in the Top 10. He
wants Pitt to return to those days.
”Talking with John Brown [the
former Pitt tight end who is now a
graduate assistant coach], he
remembered they used to play teams

with a heartbreaking 31-30 loss to
Pitt. This year the Panthers are on the
Boilermakers’ home turf in West
Lafayette, Ind., and be assured last
year's game will be high on the
minds of the Boiler veterans.

 

The problems for head
coach Leon Burtnett do not
end with the signal caller.
Only two players return to
offense, both are linemen.

But before Purdue can avenge any
loss from 1985, it must first solve the
problem of the huge gap left at
quarterback when All-America, and
the Boilermakers’ all-time leading
passer, Jim Everett graduated. Two
redshirted juniors and a freshman are
vying for the position. Doug Down-
ing and Jeff Huber are the juniors,
and Jeff George the freshman. Purdue
coaches have said the starter may not
be named until the Ball State game
September 13.

The problems for head coach Leon
Burnett do not end with the signal
caller. Only two players return to the
offense, both are linemen. The run-
ning back situation for the Boilers
could spell trouble. Gone is last
year's leading rusher and receiver

arm in 1986. All-America Rod Wood-
son returns for his senior season at
cornerback. The 6-0, 195—pound
senior has started since the first game
of his freshman year. Joining Wood-
son in the secondary will be three-
year starter Cris Dishman and

Purdue will need great
defense every week and '
hope the offense can
generate just enough points
to keep the Boilers ahead.

Ray Wallace, but the second leading
runner from a year ago is back, James
Medlock who will be the starting
tailback. The problems are even
greater at fullback. Walt Foster was
expected _to start at fullback, but he
is out due to back surgery. Tony
Grant, a 5-1 1, 226-pound junior, will
probably start in his stead.

Without Everett, Purdue will prob-
ably throw the ball considerably less
often in 1986, which means the wide
receivers — the strong point of Pur-
due’s offense in this year — may be
under-used. Wide outs Rick Brunner
and Jon Hayes are back but may find
themselves longing for the days when
a Jim Everett spiral caught them right
in the chest.

The defense will be Purdue's strong

sophomore Damon Taylor. Last year
Taylor was used as a defensive end.
Inside, the line is bolstered by the
return of Purdue's leading tackler of
a year ago, Kevin Holley. Linebacker
Anthony Rose, all 288 pounds of
him, and DeWayne Penn are expect-
ed to join Holley on the line in 1986.
Last year Purdue finished 5-6 with
what was perhaps the greatest pass-
ing attack in its history, a history that
has included such immortals as Len
Dawson and Bob Greise. This year
the passing gameis gone and the run-
ning game does not appear strong
enough to replace it. Purdue will
need great defense every week and

nope the offense can generate just
enough points to keep the Boilers
ahead.

Leading Purdue this year will be, counter clockwise, Tony Visco, James Medlock, Jonathon
Briggs, Todd Tyrie, Jon Hayes and Rod Woodson.

The Don Nehlen era of success is
firmly entrenched in Morgantown.
That was never made more evident
than by the reactions of fans and
media to last season's 7-3-1 record.

It was, by all accounts, a huge
disappointment. The Mountaineers
were_expected to challenge Penn
State for the Lambert Trophy, the

GAME 4

PITT STADIUM
 
award given annually to the top col-
lege team in the East. Instead, coun-
try roads took the Mountaineers

nowhere last bowl season — it looks
to be quite another story in 1986.

West Virginia is nobody’s choice
to play in the Orange Bowl this year,
and that is just the way Nehlen likes
it —- he can sneak up on you that

way. This is what he did to Boston
College in 1984, ending all of the
Eagle's hopes at a national crown. It
is also what he did to Penn State that
same year, ending a dry spell against
the Nittany Lions that extended all
the way back to the Eisenhower ad-
ministration.

Pitt has not beaten West Virginia
since 1982, and the 1986 game
should be another struggle for the
Panthers. Pitt matches up well with
WVU on offense, but give the edge
to the Mountaineers on defense.

West Virginia is led on defense by
All-America candidates Matt Smith
and Travis Curtis. Smith, a
235-pound linebacker, had 83
tackles in 1985, along with two sacks
and one interception. Curtis, a 5-11,
181-pound defensive back, netted

"four interceptions last season and was

in on 66 tackles.

The defensive line will be an-
chored by 6-7, 282-pound Jeff Lucas.
Lucas is the only returnee from last
year's line, but, in the secondary, four
starters are back.

On offense, the unsettling question
of who will be the quarterback who
plagued the 1985 season has been
resolved. The winner in the Moun-
taineer Quarterback Sweepstakes is
Mike Timko, a 6-2 sophomore who
saw action in six games as a
freshman. Timko was good on 44 of
84 of his throws for 567 yards and
four touchdowns.

The responsibility of running the
ball will primarily be in the hands of

  

WVU linebacker Matt Smith

6-1, 193-pound seniorJohn Holifield.
It was Holifield who led the team in
rushing last season with 595 yards.

Catching the ball for the Moun-
taineers will be veteran wide out
Harvey Smith who had 14 catches in
1985 for 273 yards. Behind Smith
will be four redshirted sophomores
—— Grantis Bell, Calvin Phillips, Keith
Winn and Robert White. The quartet
combined for 81 5 yards receiving in
1985.

One area in which the Moun-
taineers are particularly strong is the
kicking game — the Achilles’ heel of
recent Pitt teams. Sophomore,Char|ie
Baumann was 14 of 20 last season
and was a perfect 21 of 21 with his
extra points.

West Virginia should have another
in a string of excellent seasons in
1986. The big question facing the
Mountaineers concerns the offensive
line. And even that could turn in
WVU’s favor if guards Gary Ponds
and John Barton remain healthy. The
difference between a good season in
Morgantown and a great one could
lie in the continued development of
signal caller Timko and the play of
tailback John Holifield. in any event,
West Virginia will be Pitt's major test
during the 1986 season.

Palmer pumps

Temple's offense  

When Bruce Arians was named
Temple University football coach on
January 3, 1983, he promised to
bring a national championship to that
athletically beleagured school. While
the Owls are now no closer to win-
ning a national championship than
they were when Ben Franklin was
running things in Philly, Temple does
have Heisman Trophy candidate Paul
Palmer.

Palmer rushed for 1,516 yardslast
season, averaging 5.5 yards per carry.
He will have to produce Heisman-

type numbers again if Temple is to «

reverse last year's disappointing 4-7
mark. —

Handing Palmer the ball will be
quarterback Lee Saltz, who threw for
1,875 yards last year along with 13
touchdown passes.

”Lee Saltzlis outstanding and will
push for All-East and All-America
honors,” Arians said.

Saltz, if he remains healthy, will
most likely equal or surpass his 1985
numbers due to the return of his top
two receivers of a year ago.

Wide outs Willie Marshall and
Keith Gloster are back after posting
fine seasons a year ago. Marshall
caught 40 balls for 893 yards, and
Closter pulled in 14 catches for 377
yards, good for a 26.9 per catch
average. -

The biggest problem facing the
Temple offense is the departure of all
five starting linemen of last year, most

notably All-America and Steeler draft
pick John Reinstra. The starters in
1986 have the experience of just 20
games total.

The defense cost Temple a number
of close games in 1985, but that
shouldn't happen this season. Arians
has said the defensive line might be

' GAME 5  
TEMPLE

l""'|

TEMPLE
UNIVERSITY

ocronan 4

the strongest part of the team. Behind
the linemen, all the starting
linebackers of a year ago are back.

The line was notably weak against
the run in 1985, giving up an average

of 233 yards rushing per game. lfthat. -‘

trend continues in 1986, teams like
Pitt which feature strong running
games may just keep the ball ground-
ed all day.

Pitt sports— football is the once and future ki.

I'm sure that during your
senior year in high school, and
even before that, you were in-
undated with brochures from
college after college claiming
that perhaps their greatest at-
tribute is diversity. Never
knowing just what that word
meant to them, you sort of
skipped over it and got to the
important part of the brochure,
like what the drinking age is in
that state.

Well

sports fans, rest

assured, because at Pitt you

will come to learn the mean-
ing of the word diversity.

domination of the Greek
system the way many large
rural schools are. But just
because the Greek system is
not all-pervasive, that does not
mean there are not a lot of
ways to get in trouble.

The easiest way to get in
trouble is by joining the foot-
ball team -— those guys are
always in hot water. No, no
I'm joking. Another thing
you'll learn at Pitt is that the
athletic department has a great
sense of humor. Hail to Pitt!

Seriously, there is something

dent at Pitt, from a quiet

team is the most known of
Pitt's varsity teams and with
good reason. The Panthers
have won nine national cham-
pionships since instituting
football, the first title came in
1915, the most recent in 1976.

In the 10 years since that last
championship, Pitt football has
had its share of ups and downs
to say the least. After Johnny
Majors resigned in the winter
of '77, Jackie Sherrill guided
the Panthers to three straight
11-1 seasons during his years
as head coach. Of course Sher-
rill had the help of such Pitt
legends as Dan Marino, Hugh

Fazio had trouble from the
outset. The 1982 team, ex-
pected to challenge for the na-
tional championship and led
by seniors like Dan Marino

finished 8-3-1, including a Cot-

Minnesota, will have to build at
Notre Dame as well, albeit he will
have much better talent at South
Bend than he ever had at Min-
neapolis.

Despite a bevy of raw talent, Holtz
certainly has his work cut out for him.
His most difficult job will be to find
a replacement for tailback Allen Pin-
ckett, Notre Dame's all-time leading
rusher.

Pinckett’s back-ups of a year ago,
Hiawatha Francisco and Alonzo Jef-
ferson, both underwent off-season
surgery and are not expected to play
this year. That leaves two sopho-
mores to fill the tailback slot —
D’Juan Francisco and Corny Southall.

McCallum, Navy still figures to have
a solid running attack. Senior Matt
Smith, McCa|lum’s back-up, will start
at tailback. Smith rushed for 244
yards last season. At the fullback slot,
both of last year's regulars, 6-O,
226-pound John Bemer and 5-10,
186-pound Chuck Smith, are back.

When Byrne chooses to put the
ball in the air, which figures to be
often this season, he will have a fine
corp of receivers to whom to throw.
Split end Troy Sanders and tight end
John Sniffen are both All-East pros-
pects and should give the Mid-
shipmen a very potent passing attack.

Tranquill said after spring practices’
that the biggest surprise on the team
was the play of the defensive line.
Senior tackles Kent Van Horn and
Bob Plantz will anchor the line and
surround Enoch Blazis at middle
guard.

The Irish look to be very strong at

must be completely rebuilt. All-
America guard Tim Scannell will be
especially tough to replace.

The Notre Dame defense should
be adequate, if not outstanding. The
line will be anchored by tackles
Robert Banks, Wally Kleine and Mike

stops.

Navy should have a fairly good
passing game in 1986, but it probably
won't be enough to make up for the
offensive punch lost with McCa|lum.
The defense is experienced and
could surprise more than a few teams
with its stinginess this year.

Pitt has been snake-bitten against
Navy the past two seasons. In 1984
Navy executed a great fourth quarter
comeback to tie Pitt during the clos-
ing seconds of the game, and last year
the Panthers could generate no of-
fense and lost 21-7 at Annapolis.

Navy was 4-7 last season, but it
must be noted that several of the Mid-
shipmen losses were by only a few
points. The Middies dropped the
opener in 1985 to North Carolina
21-19, then lost to Delaware 16-13,

ou Holtz waking up the echoes

Carney, a senior.

A new attitude will pervade Notre
Dame in 1986. Under Faust, the lrish
were a team that lacked confidence.
That is the one thing they will have
an abundance of under Holtz. But at-
titude alone does not win games. For
the Irish to be successful in 1986,
Burlein will have to show more than
the occasional flashes of brilliance he
has given Notre Dame in the years
he has been the starter. The Irish will
also need a tailback who can rush for
at least 700 yards, plus a great deal
of production from the fullback posi-
tion. To top it all off, the Irish must
have the offensive line play beyond
their years, and the defense must
keep the score down.

Indiana 38-35, Syracuse 24-20 and
South Carolina 34-31.

One of the few blowouts was the
Air Force game, which Navy dropped
24-7. Along with the Air Force
Academy, Navy football teams dur-
ing the 1980s have brought respect

. to service academy athletics such has

not been seen in 30 years.

Helping matters immensely was «

the play of the Navy basketball team
in last year's NCAA tournament.
With Napoleon McCallum, Navy
proved it can recruit great atheletes
in the '80s. While Navy has no player
the caliber of McCa||um in 1986, it
does have several top—notch per-
formers who would be NFL draft

picks were they not required to serve I

in the military. -

Navy plays a very difficult schedule
in 1986, but the Midshipmen have
the talent it takes to climb back over
the .500 mark.

The offensive line lost three starters
from last year's squad, but two
starters do return (center Jim Leible
and guard Tom Watson). Also return-
ing is tackle Shawn Garrity who
would have started last year if not for
a season-ending injury.

The strength of the Syracuse team
is in its defensive unit where five
starters return. The most glaring loss
is Tim Green, the Orangemen’s All-
America tackle. His replacement will
be junior Paul Frase. Standout nose
guard Ted Gregory and Wes Dove
also return to anchor what should be
another tough front line in Syracuse's

3-4 alignment.

All-East candidate Tim Pidgeon, the
team's leading tackler (164), is a lock
at inside linebacker, while Keith
Friberg, Roger Remoand Doug Pina
have the inside track for the remain-
ing spots. Linebacker may well be the
strength of this year’s team.

The defensive backfield should be
much improved this season. In 1985
the Orange started three redshirt
freshmen in the secondary at times.
Those players should all be much
better with a year's experience.

Miami in hunt for No. 1  

Pitt closes its season with two of its
final three games against teams that
are legitimate national championship
contenders.

The Miami Hurricanes are the first
of these two teams. The Hurricanes
are in town for a game November 8
at Pitt Stadium.

Just when you thought it was safe
to blitz the Hurricanes, Coach
Howard Schnellenberger came up
with Bernie Kosar to replace Kelly.
All Kosar did his first season at the
helm was lead Miami to a national
championship when the Hurricanes
upset Nebraska in the 1984 Orange
Bowl.

Schnellenberger left after that na-
tional championship year —- shades
of Johnny Majors .— and wound"up
as head coach at Louisville. Former
Pitt assistant Jimmy Johnson was
given the head coaching job and he
brought the current Miami super-
quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, to the
attention of the sporting public.

Back for his senior year, Testeverde
finds himself directing an offense that
is both deeply talented and exper-
ienced.

Mike lrvin and Brian Blades stepped
in. Blades is also a world class
sprinter. Irvin was a freshman All-
America last season and will prob-
ably be a full-fledged All-America by
the time he leaves Miami. ’

The offensive line returns four
starters,-but there is not much depth
there. If Miami has injury problems
up front, it could find itself in some
trouble.

To complement Heisman Trophy
candidate Testeverde on offense, the
Hurricanes have an Outland Trophy
candidate on defense. He is Jerome
Brown, a 6-3, 275 senior defensive
tackle. A second team All—America
last season, Brown had 75 tackles
and nine sacks. Brown will be aided
on the line by returnees Dervvin Jones
and Daniel Stubbs.

The Hurricanes do not have a weak
spot on the entire team. Miami could
be undefeated and ranked first in the
nation by the time the Pitt game rolls
around. At worst the Hurricanes
should have one loss, that being to
Oklahoma. in either case, look for a
long day at the stadium for the Pan-
thers, and look for Miami on New
Year's Day.

Long climb up
for Scarlet Knights

Pitt gives itself a break between the
two toughest games on its schedule
this year, Miami and Penn State, by
squeezing Rutgers in between those
two powerhouses.

Rutgers was 2-8-1 last season, and
the Scarlet Knights will be hard
pressed to improve much on that
record. Rutgers lost eight starters from
an offense that on its best day last
season scored 28 points. After that,
16 points was the most the Scarlet of-
fense could muster.

And this year could be even worse.

Gone is Rusty Hochberg, Rutgers’
a||—time passing leader. One would
think that a school's all-time leading
passer would be outstanding his
senior year — Dan Marino not-
withstanding — but this is not so at
Rutgers. Hochberg was out-passed by
junior Joe Gagliardi. This year
Gagliardi is a senior and big things
are expected of him. In 1985 the 6-2,
205-pound native of North Babylon,
N.Y., threw for over 1,200 yards and
completed a strong 58.2 percent of
his passes.

When Gagliardi puts the ball in the
air, he will be throwing to an ex-
perienced group of receivers. Juniors
Bruce Campbell and Greg Alvord are
back, and so are flankers Ray Hoover
and Brian Cobb.

The running back corps lost its
leading rusher of the past three
seasons to graduation, but a pair of
mildly experienced backs will at-
tempt to carry the load in 1986.
Junior Matt Prescott and sophomore
Henry Henderson averaged 5.9 and
5 yards per run, respectively, last
season.

The offensive loses four starters and
will have to be completely rebuilt.
The only return'ee is Lee Getz,‘6-3,
245-pounds, and one of the nation's
top wrestlers in the heavyweight
division.

The defense returns eight starters,

including a few good ones like All-

6-2, 225-pound senior out of Passaic,.
N.J., Stowe was voted to AP
honorable mention All-America team
at the end of last season. Helping
Stowe at linebacker will be Butler,
Pa., native Matt Bachman and
veteran Andre Cox. '

Propping up the pass defense is
another senior, Steve Twamley, who
has started every game at cornerback
the past two seasons.

This could be another long season
for Rutgers head coach Dick Ander-
son, a former right-hand man of Joe
Paterno. Anderson has promised to
instill a winning attitude and a win-
ning team at Rutgers, but he has not
delivered during his first two seasons
on the job. Unfortunately for Ander-
son, however, most of the players he
has to work with were recruited by
the old regime.

Rutgers must play wide open foot-
ball and sneak up on teams in 1986
if they are to have a successful year.
After all the Scarlet Knights did tie
Florida last season. 7

Now, if only they could beat them.

Lions even b ette r i n '8 6 1

Pitt closes its season with the
renewal of one of the great
rivalries in college athletics — the
annual Penn State game. The Pan-
thers were blown out by the Nit-
tany Lions 31-0 last year by a
Penn State team that would have
been national champions had it
not lost to Oklahoma in the
Orange Bowl. -

In 1985 Penn State was not so
much a great team as one that
simply would not lose. Of the"Nit-
tany Lions’ 11 wins last year five
were by four points or less, in-
cluding two point squeakers over
Mary|and,’Alabama and Temple.

But a year has passed since
those games, and now Penn State
can deservedly be called a great
team. It is not often that a team
can challenge for the national
championship one year and come
back the next improved, but Penn
State should be one of those
teams.

Penn State lost only five starters
to graduation, although that small
group included such stalwarts as
linebacker Rogers Alexander and
defensive back Lance Hamilton.
But first team All—America Shane
Conlan returns along with poten-
tial All-Americas Tim Johnson and
D.J. Dozier.

Offensively, all the Lions’ skill
players are back including
quarterback John Shaffer, the
tailback Dozier, fullback Steve
Smith, split end Ray Roundtree
and flanker Eric Hamilton.

The offensive line was hit
harder by graduation than any
other part of the Penn State team.
Gone are tight end Dean DiMidio
and guard Todd Moules. ~
Returnees include guards Mitch

Conlins (6-3, 275-pounds) and
Keith Radecic (6-1,
251-pounds).
Penn State has a great deal of
depth on offense as well. Back-
ups such as fullback Tim Manoa,
flanker Michael Timpson and
‘quarterback Matt Kniz ner all
have seen playing time in the past
and will most likely make con-
tributions to the offense this year
as well.‘

Penn State had one of the best
defenses in America in 1985,
ranking fifth in points allowed

(11.9 per game) and 19th in pass ..

defense (156.9 yards per game).

Like the offensive line the
defensive backfield took its lumps
when the class of '86 received
their diplomas. Replacing players
as talented as Michael Zordich,
Hamilton and Alexander will not
be easy, but Joe Paterno has never
been a coach known to let his
well run dry. 1986 should be
another example of Paterno
reloading.

Junior Pete Giftopoulos will
replace Alexander, Marques

 

coaching the Nitany Lions his

_one that produces the most peo-, '

Henderson, ‘a junior, will take
Zordich’s spot at the hero posi-
tion, and sophomore Eddie’
Johnson will step in for Hamilton.

The Nittany Lions are also in
possession of one of America's
better kickers, Massimo Manca.
The senior from Reno, Nev., was ,
21-26 kicking field goals last year
averaging 1.91 field goals per
game, the fourth highest average
in the -nation.

As hard it may be to believe, the
team that came one game away -.
from winning its second national
title in four years last season,
should be even better this year.

The Lions" return their leading . —  I

rusher, passer, receiver and in-
terceptor. The Nittany Lions went
to the Orange Bowl a young team
last year. They are no longer so
young, 16 seniors will start‘ for _
Paterno in 1986.

Joe Paterno has one of the — 0

distinguished records in college
football. In Paterno’s 20 years

teams have gone to Bowl games
17 times. One of his teams has
won a national championship.
Two more should have. And out- "
side of Notre Dame, there is not .
a football program in America .
with a better reputation than Penn —
State's. When asked what his best
ever team was, Paterno gave an
answer only he could give.

’’People ask me what my best f
team has been, and I tell them I
don't know yet,” Paterno observ-
ed. ”Our best team will be the .

Gladman
wants
wins
with stats

By Brian Canning

For The Pitt News

Number 32: It's a number steeped
in football tradition. Even the most
casual of football observers can readi-
ly recognize the names of Franco
Harris, Jim Brown and the immortal
Orenthal James (O.J) Simpson.

The University of Pittsburgh has its
own contribution to that illustrious
list of famous 32s. l-le is Charles
Gladman, a junior tailback out of
Garfield High School in Akron, Ohio,
who led Panther rushers last year
with 1,085 yards.

Gladman has on more than one oc-
casion been compared to The Juice.
In fact, running mate Zeke Gadson
nicknamed him J.U. Ice.

”People say that we are the same
type "of runner,” said Gladman. ‘'1
don't know if I see it. They say that
he saw all of the field and so do I.
We are both slashers. I only hope that
someday I can be as good as he
was.”

That goal is not entirely out of the
question. The 5-11, 205-pound Glad-
man is a natural runner.

“Charles is a hard runner. He
knows what he has to do and he does

‘ it. He always has a positive attitude,”

said backfield coach Tommie Liggins.

Although Simpson and Gladman
are natural runners, each one was
more than happy to share credit for

their feats with their teammates. ‘

Simpson ran behind blockers such as
fullback Jim Braxton, and linemen Joe
DeLamielleure and Reggie
McKenzie. J

Gladman has a similar type of set-
up at Pitt with senior fullback Tom
Brown, sophomore guard Mark Step-
noski and senior tackle Randy Dixon.

”We have got Dixon and Stepnoski
on the same side,” Gladman said.
”Randy will be a certain first-round
draft choice this year and so will
Mark in time. Those two will set the
tone of the game.”

Gladman also has nothing but
praise for backfield-mate Brown.
”Tommy gives his all on every play,”
commented Gladman. ’’I do not want
to let him down. If he creates a hole,
I do not want to miss it.”

Gladman and the Panthers worked
hard at summer training camp at

Edinboro University preparing for the

upcoming season.

Starting Monday night against
Maryland, J.U. Ice and his teammates
will display their talents in what will
hopefully be a successful first year
under Coach Mike Gottfried.

Brown ho

Panther
lineman
set to go

By Mike Bodek

For The Pitt News

University of Pittsburgh offensive
tackle Randy Dixon has a tough act
to follow. He is the Panthers’ first All-
America candidate on the offensive
line since Bill Fralic.

’’I’m hoping to make All-America,”
said Dixon. ’’I played with Fralic and
Jim Sweeney [now of the New York
Jets]. They are different kinds of
players with different kinds of styles.
1 have a style of my own, and I'll try
to uphold my name.”

Dixon, a senior from Clewiston,
Fla., is doing a good job of upholding
his name with the new Pitt coaching
staff. He made a definite impression
during spring practice.

"[Dixon is] the best offensive
lineman in the country,” said Mike
Solari, Pitt's new offensive line coach.
”He is a great run blocker and an ex-
cellent pass blocker. If he isn't the

best,-I would like to see someone bet-.

[I

ter.

The Panthers will rely on the offen-
sive line a great deal this season, and
Dixon appears ready for the
challenge. He will admit, however,
that the line as a unit still has room
for improvement.

”Right now we're not clicking like
we should,” observed Dixon. ”We
have three guys who played a lot last
year in Mark Stepnoski, Bobby Sign
and Chip Baukauskas, but we have
to get two young guys ready to play.
If we work hard at camp, we'll be
ready by Maryland.”

One area of concern for Dixon was
his damaged hand, but he said not to
worry.

By Brian Canning
For The Pitt News

Behind every great running back,
or in front of every great running
back, there is usually a great fullback.
Franco Harris had Rocky Bleier, Jim
Brown had Bobby Mitchell, and O.J.
Simpson had Jim Braxton. At the
University of Pittsburgh, the backfield
is no exception — Charles Gladman
has Tom Brown. ~

Walter Johnson, Pitt's strongest player, will be a key to the success of thedefense.

Brown, a 6-1, 225-pound senior
who hails from Lower Burrell, led the
way for Charles G|adman’s 1,085

down

Every new college student is
warned about the dreaded ”freshmen
15,” which translates into a once
svelte high school frame that is now
carrying an additional 15 pounds of
pizza, cheeseburgers, french fries and
been I

But the University of Pittsburgh's
Roman Matusz, the Newark, N.J.,
native who graduated from Seton
Hall Prep, likes to do things in a big
way. Matusz tried the freshmen 15
and turned it into the freshmen 40.
The once 250-pound, highly
recruited offensive tackle had
become a 290-pound advertising
candidate for Goodyear.

‘'1 was a little over 290 ‘when I
came here,” Matusz said. ’’I was very
much overweight, and I sat down
with Buddy Morris, who is the
strength and conditioning coach, and
he said I would have to lose weight
in order to be a good football player.”

”He weighed 300 pounds, the
liar,” joked Morris. ”Roman had no
strength, no mobility and no condi-
tioning when he came here.”

While at freshmen football camp in
1985, Matusz went down with a
knee injury — an injury that Morris
considered a blessing in disguise —
and was redshirted for the season.

”That injury was the best thing that
could have happened to him,” Mor-
ris said. ’’It gave him the time to learn
blocking techniques while gaining
strength.”

Matusz has now earned his way
into a second string slot behind All-
America candidate Randy Dixon on
the offensive line and is continuing
to gain power while losing pounds.
Matusz now "weighs 250 pounds
while continuing to diet.

”lt’s the ability to work hard that
separates the Bill Fralics [a Pitt
graduate who is now with the Atlan-
ta Falcons] and the Jim Sweeneys
[a Pitt graduate who is now playing
for the New York Jets] from average
football players,” Morris said. ’’If
more people worked out like Roman
Matusz works out, they'd be better
off.”

’’I feel a lot better in terms of be-
ing quicker and being able to move
my feet, especially when playing
tackle, so I can get out and meet the
defensive player using a speed [pass]
rush around the outside,” Matusz
said.

When Matusz was 290 pounds he
would have only watched the pass
rush from the sidelines.

Pitt women's volleyball coach
Shelton Collier is hoping that his
team will come back hungry this
season.

It is not as if the Panthers did poorly
last season. They won 11 matches in

’ a row en route to a 26-11 record. But
-» _ it was that 11th loss, in the finals of
' i the Big East Tournament, that caused

them to fall short of their goal of com-
peting in the NCAA women's volley-
ball tournament for the second

1' 9 . straight year.

’’I hope the sting [of last year's loss]
will make them try even harder,” said
Collier.

Seniors Sue Hoover and Kris Wex-
ell are veterans of Pitt's last Big East
winning squad from '84. They will
lead Pitt's squad — one of the best
in the East.

”Kris is the shortest member of our
squad [5-5], but one of our most
skilled players,” said Collier about his
star outside spiker. Hoover, the team
captain, was last season's Big East
Player of the Year.

Collier knows the play of these two
stars, as he has coached Hoover and
Wexell for the last seven years — the
last four years at Pitt and for three

years while the two were in high
school playing under Collier on
AAU/Junior Olympic teams which
finished in the nation's top five.
Also returning will be the team's

team at 5-11.

outside spiker. However, O’Shaugh-
nessy is recovering from arthroscopic
knee surgery.

most valuable player, Lisa Stewart.
Stewart led the team in kill percen-
tage and number of kills while mak-
ing the All-Big East team in 1985.
Stewart also has the highest vertical
leap on the team at 29 inches.
Looking to step into Stewart's shoes
as the Panthers’ No. 1 middle blocker
is sophomore Nora Mulvihill.
Mulvihill, a high school teammate of
Wexell’s from Norwin High School,

as one of the Volleyball Monthly
”Fabulous Fifty” recruits.

One question in Collier’s mind in-
volves who will play the all-important
setter position. Collier, who was an
All-America setter at Ohio State, com-
pares the position to playing quarter-
back in football.

The leading candidate for the set-
ter position is Louise O’Shaughnessy,
who has started for two seasons as an

use Lori Silk, a freshman setter/out-
side hitter at setter. According to Col-
lier, Silk was ”the best all-around
high school player in Pennsylvania
last year.”

”This year our goal is to win the

Big East again and return to the
NCAA Tournament,” said Collier.
Once they make the NCAAS, the Pan-
thers will be ready for tough competi-
tion. ’’I put on our schedule every

Volleyball team set for another good year

nationally ranked team that we could
expect to face in the first round of the
NCAAs

”We have a really exciting home
opener against Santa Barbara [Sept.
19 —— one of the top-ranked Califor-
nia teams]/’ Collier stated.

The Pitt Volleyball team stands to
have the flavor of the men's and
women's national teams. This sum-
mer Collier went to San Diego to
help his college coach, Terry
Liskevych, as an assistant coach on
the U.S. Women's Team. The coor-
dinator of the U.S. men's and
women's volleyball teams, Doug
Beal coached Collier in his freshman
year at Ohio State.

The national teams have not
chosen any assistant coaches for the
1988 Olympic Games, but if Collier
accepted a spot he would have to
give up his coaching job at Pitt.
However, Collier said that for now,
”My first priority is to have the best
team possible here at Pitt and advis-
ing the national team whenever
possible.

Volleyball coach Shelton Collier
announced that tryouts for this year's
women's volleyball team will be con-
ducted on Monday, Sept. 8, at 4 p.m.
in the small gym at Trees Hall.
Players should come dressed in prac-
tice gear.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, August 29, i986

as freshman makes her bid for top position

By Rob Seitzinger

For The Pitt News

Consistency can be the key to a
successful season in sports. Coaches
swear by it, players harp on it, fans
demand it and teams are
remembered by it.

For example, who will ever forget
The Big Red Machine in baseball in
the '70s orthe Pittsburgh Steelers
glory years in the late '70s.

The Panthers women's tennis team
is also a model of consistency. They
have c'onsistently been inconsistent
since 1979. But, George Dieffenbach
took over as head coach in 1981 and
has been working to steady the Lady
Panthers. Since Dieffenbach has been
at the helm, Pitt has steadied into a
29-29 record.

In 1981, Pitt won only one match
going 1-9 but came back in 1982 to
go 8-2. The next year proved to be
another sub-.500 season, and the pro-
gram seemed to be headed for a
frustrating roller coaster ride of ups
and downs.

Then in 1984, Jodi Levine earned

MVP honors while leading the Lady ’

Panthers to a 9-5 record. And last
season Carrie DeVera was voted

Runners
ready for
'86 race

The 1986 season looks to be a
good one for both’ the men's and
women's cross country teams.

The men are coming off a strong
year finishing 2-1 in dual meets, with
first place finishes at California

University and Fairmont St. lnvita-'

tionals.

”Last year's team was the best
we've had in a long time,” said
Coach John Vasvary. ”l was quite
pleased with the way the team per-
formed as a whole, as well as in-
dividually.”

Returning will be MVP Ken Pic-
ciano. He will be joined by track All-
Americas Bob Weiner and Joe
Daniels, as well as Big East
steeplechase champion Joel Ninos.

”We have a good, experienced
group this year,” Vasvary said. ’’I’m
looking for them to do some good
things. We have a very competitive
schedule, but I think we'll do just
fine. 9 .

”The Big East is a tough con-
ference, but we have the talent to
compete with the best of them.”

On the women's side the outlook
is just as bright. The Lady Panthers
fielded a team last year for the first
time in a while. Going without ex-
perience, they did quite well and
finished with a 3-1 record. They also
took first place at the Fairmont Invita-
tional. A

”The women's team was a big sur-
prise,” Vasvary said. ”They had not
competed in several years, and they
really went out and did a good job.
I'm looking for them to have another
strong year.”

The Lady Panthers will have one
luxury they didn't have last year —
a Big East champion. Lori Wood,
who was All-Big East a year ago, will
return to lead the contingent. She will
be joined by Hannah Russell and
Phyllis Collier, both experienced
competitors.

”We made a lot of progress last
year,” Vasvary said, ”and I expect
that to carry over into this season.”

 

MVP when Pitt went 7-6.
Dieffenbach believes this season
will be very important for the Lady
Panthers in that a successful season
will instill a winning attitude and put
an end to any doubts his players may

which she concentrated on her
studies. In 1984, Levine was an im-
pressive 9-2 in the No. 1 slot. Dief-
fenbach is pleased to have Levine
back and said she will be challenged
by an impressive freshman for the

it should be a good battle.”
Devera will also be an upper-level
singles player for Pitt after going 9-4
last season. DeVera was the only
Lady Panther to win a match in the
Big East championships, in which Pitt

PREVIEW  

 

have about their potential.

”We really need a winning
season,” Dieffenbach said,” but the
main thing that I look for is not
record, but the improvement in their
game and their performance on the
court. A winning season will come
if they stay with it long enough. If
they work hard enough and have the
right attitude, eventually they will
have a winning record.”

Levine, the only senior on the
squad, returns from a year off during

honor of playing in the number one
singles slot.

The challenger is Tracy Feltingoff
from Emmaus High School in Allen-
town, Pa. Feltingoff compiled a 30-3
record while playing for Emmaus and
was the Pocono Mountain Junior
Champion, Lehigh : Valley MSJA
finalist, Scranton MSJA finalist and
Northeastern Junior Open finalist.

”Tracy and Jodi should battle it out
for the No.1 slot,” Dieffenbach said.
"They are both excellent players, and

finished last for the fourth straight
season.

”Our team has never done really
well at the Big East championships,”
Dieffenbach said. ”That’s our goal

this year — to do well there. We need ‘

to develop confidence throughout
the season, produce a winning team
and record, and carry it forward with
a lot of momentum into the Big East
championships [to] get out of last
place. There's only one way we can
go, and that is up.”

Three juniors and a sophomore
round out the young roster for Pitt.
Michelle Hobson, Bridgette Kyle and
Stephanie Nelson enter their junior
year and will be a strong nucleus for
the fourth, fifth and sixth singles slots
and will also strengthen Pitt's doubles
play.

Nelson earned an 8-5 record last

season in singles play; Kyle was 6-2 s

in doubles play; and Hobson was 3-3
in doubles competition.

Karen Meade, the only sophomore

I on the team, is a strong-willed player

and improved consistently in 1985.

The Pitt tennis teams play their
home matches at Trees Courts. The

courts are located behind Trees Hall ‘

near the baseball field. All matches-

are open to the public and no admis- '

sion is charged. The women's team
plays during the autumn months, and
the men play during the spring. V
One thing to keep in mind is that
no Pitt tennis, players are given
athletic scholarships but a number of
schools that Pitt competes against do
have scholarship athletes competing.

Pitt tennis is also handicapped by the .

fact that there are no indoor facilities
on campus. In order to get in a winter

workout,‘the players must travel to .
one of the area racquet clubs, none.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, August 29, 1986

By Douglas Payne

lf you own a VCR, chances
are you have little desire to go
to the cinema. lf you're new to
the Oakland area, you prob-
ably think entertainment is an
evening spent at the Upstage,
right? Well, if so, you're missing
a harvest of great film oppor-
; tunities right in your own back
yard. Aside from the barrage of
video rental outlets, Oakland
. takes great pride in its diverse
I devotion to the arts and enter-

g

 

tainment. There are several
venues nearby which screen as
wide a spectrum of films as the
audience which resides in
Oakland.

First, there is the Pittsburgh
Playhouse on 222 Craft Ave. lts
films run the gamut of popular,
foreign and classics, to the
esoteric art and ever—popular
cult films. For instance, a Marx
Brother's double bill featuring
Duc/< Soup and Horse Feathers
will be shown tonight; the col-
legiate favorite Monty Python
and the Ho/y Graii can be seen
tomorrow night and on Sunday
evening it's cult fun with Woody
Allen's oddball movie Play it
Again Sam. The Playhouse

   

Oakland's wide world   or

high quality films, mostly on a
one-night showing basis, as well
as occasional theater presenta-
tions throughout the year. Free
monthly schedules are available
at the theater or at many
Oakland merchants, and admis-
sion is always $2.95. For morlel
ca

information you can
o2l-4445.
Pittsburgh Filmmakers is

located at 205 Oakland Ave.,
yet most of their films are now
screened downtown at the
Fulton Theater on lOl Sixth St.
They often feature small, in-
dependent films of an unusually
high artistic caliber which never
cross into the cross commer-
cialism of the box-office hits
we've all seen again and again.
Currently, the gripping epic film
from lndia Home and the War/a’
is playing until Sunday evening.
It's highly recommended and in-
dicative of the quality of cinema
they present. Also scheduled is
Laurie Anderson's film Home of
the Brave which will run
sometime in September. The
Pittsburgh Filmmakers is a group
of professionals who offer
courses in film production and
direction as well as filmstudies,

in addition to the remarkable

films they screen. Free

By David Zuchowski

lt’s that time of year when
local scholars hopefully resume
their intellectual pursuits, leaving
behind the golden days of sum-
mer only to begin their voyages
through academia. And while
the warm days of summer may
linger on for a while, gray times
of cold weather, term papers,
lectures and exams certainly lie
ahead. But fear not — there is

relief for these soul-trying times"

in the form of an abundance of
cultural amusements guaranteed
to lift the spirits of even the most
despondent individuals. The lack
of financial wherewithal is no ex-
cuse for failing to indulge in
these diversions, for many of the

concerts and events (such as the

Frick Art Museum concerts, the

" Pitt Concert Series, the St. Paul

Organ recitals and the Chamber
Music Series at Rodef Shalom)
are free. Others (such as the
New Music Ensemble concerts,
the Chamber Music Society can-
certs and the International
Poetry Forum readings) are
available for a mere pittance of
$3. or $4. And most of the
organizations listed below have
low—cost student subscriptions —
a real boon for the financially
strapped scholar. The following
list of some of the city's cultural
organizations, gives a brief
sketch of their repertoire and
focus, as well as their season
highlights. For more detailed in-
formation as to concert dates,
programs, prices and so forth,
the telephone numbers of the
groups have been provided to
enable interested parties to

solicit their season brochures. .

_  Miles Davis is cool again. In

the late ’40s he ushered in a
new generation of jazz with Birth
of the Cool, on album featuring

"  a stellar nine-piece band. The

 '50s brought landmark record-
.-ings with Gil Evans and, of
’_.course, the legendary Kind of
j , B/ue album teaturing Bill Evans,
F " Cannonball Adderly and John

’ Coltrane. The '60s saw the

Prince of Darkness, as he is
known to same, again redefining
the meaning of jazz by plugging

-7.3 A in his rhythm section, which in-
S" cluded Herbie Hancock and
L  Wayne Shorter, on _/Vii/es in the
 Sky and /n a Si/ent Way. Near-
 ly singlehandedly forging new

‘directions in music ranging from

 _ rock and blues to classical and

flamenco, he raised the blood

L’ " ~ Bitches Brew, yet he'd found an
 entire legion of new fans with
A ‘a last year's glossy pop endeavor

 

You're Under Arrest. But now
he's cool. In the last year he's
been seen pushing Honda

coc/< Presents. The fact is that

  Davis is as famous now for his

personality as he is for his music.

Can MTV be far behind?
Tonight he makes an ap-

pearance at the Pittsburgh Jazz

A Festival down at Heinz Hall with

a nine-piece band including new

‘ guitarist Robben Ford, Miles’

nephew, drummer Vincent
Wilburn Jr. and keyboardist

_Robert lrving lll, who's been with

 

 

  9 rebirt'h
of the cool

Miles since his l98l comeback.
Miles Dewey Davis lll was
born May 26, i926 in Alton, lll.,
and began playing trumpet at
l3. Soon thereafter, he began
jamming with Clark Terry in
Chicago, which led to local gigs
with Billy Eckstein and Benny
Carter. After graduating from
high school in l945, he entered
Julliard School of Music but
dropped out after spending time
on 52nd Street in Manhattan
trading riffs with Charlie Parker
and Dizzy Gillespie. Quickly
gaining popularity and
cultivating his talent during the
’40s, he established himself as
the newest major voice on
trumpet since Louis Armstrong
and Gillespie.
He recorded as a leade for

 

 

musical ideas and experiments.
This brought Sketches of Spain,
Mi/es Ahead and Por y and
Bess, all of which are coll7abora—
tions with the gifted Gil Evans,
whom Davis still refers to as ”the
musician for me.” Other Davis
influences include Duke Ellington
(to whom he‘ wrote and
dedicated l974’s ”He Loved
Him Madly") and Ahmad
Jamal, who appeared last night
at the Jazz Festival.

”l didn't get into music for any
competition,” Miles said recent-
ly. ’’If I wanted competition, I
would have become an
athlete.” This philosophy has
been consistent throughout his
career, especially in the '60s as
he successfully recruited the
finest young musicians in jazz to

A incessantly challenge the bar-

riers of music. After Kind of Blue
changed the spectrum of

 modern jazz in l959, Davis,

who has a reputation for attrac-
ting, tutoring and spawning the
most talented musicians, formed
his second brilliant quintet with
Ron Carter on bass, Tony
Williams on drums, Herbie Han-

 cock on piano and Wayne

a series of definitive jazz albums

retrospective, chart the evolution
of jazz in that'period. These
recordings lead to l970’s Bit-

album to date, and christened
the age of fusion in the ’70s.
This decade marked many

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, August 29, I986

ncl ...

barnstorming sets, they wowed

_sell-out audiences and tough-
minded critics alike. Dylan, the
critics continue to declare, is on
a roll. Although hailed as being
in the midst of a comeback,
Dylan exudes such energy and
creativity in his current extended
tour, the hour—long HBO special
and the iust-released Knocked
Out loaded that it is impossible
to believe that all this is just an
attempt at recreating his own
myth.

ll. Visions of Johanna

Dylan on a comeback?
Perhaps he never left.
Regardless of such speculative
concerns, the‘ evidence is strong
that Dylan, now, is in a very pro-
ductive, creative stage —
perhaps even ‘a new peak.
Many fans were disappointed
with Dylan's so—called ’’born
again phase” — but when is his
music not religious in nature? For
less stalwart fans, the new, more
accessible albums have

reawakened their awareness of '

Dylan's prowess as a committed
rock leader.

Petty and the Heartbreakers,
it seems, badly needed the
positive reaction. Coming off of
a lackluster long After Dark, the
band considered breaking up
before the recording of Southern
Accents. The album, his most
self—conscious to date, was a
change of pace for Petty.
Underscoring the success of
Southern Accents, their Pac/< Up
The P/antation tour enioyed the
band's largest crowds to date
and drew wide critical acclaim.

Slow to come out of the ever-
looming shadows of the likes of
Bruce Springsteen and Bob
Seger, Tom Petty may now be
carving out his own niche as a
rock ’n’ roll superstar. The Dylan
tour, which includes seven
stadium dates with the Grateful
Dead, challenged Petty and the
Heartbreakers who were not
used to such huge audiences.
Commenting upon the high ex-
pectations of this fruitful and ex-
tended collaboration with Bob
Dylan, Petty asserted in an inter-
view with Ro//irrg Stone, ”Not
many people can walk into a
room of 20,000, stare at them
and get their attention. That's
not an easy trick.”

Ill. Jokerman

Unlike the inspiration of more
extroverted rockers such as
Bruce Springsteen or The Who,
which emanates from drawing
audiences into hotter and hotter
participation in the perform-
ances, Dylan’s flame of inspira-
tion seems to burn eternal. As a
result, he requires that you at-
tach yourself to him. Dylan's set
in Akron on July 2 was void of
any banal audience banter and
Herculean theatrical posturing,
but high on musical excitement.

We entered the stadium late.
Dylan, in his second song, was
leading a rousing "Clean Cut
Kid.” The sound quality was
distorted and disturbing; we
figured that his sound men were
unprepared for such an outdoor
festival venue. Having floor
tickets, we made our way onto

the field and through the crowd‘

songs continued to fulfill the ob-
iect of relaying truth ‘ to their
listeners. Truth, not merely in-
dividual and local-,'but universal
and operative, carried into the
heart by passion and relying not
upon a festive atmosphere, but
upon the songs themselves for its
testimony. He definitely seemed
more emotionally attached to his
recent material.

These newer songs differed
widely in the nature of their im-
ages, themes and achieve-
ments. At times, Dylan
expressed impassioned thought

" SQUIRREL DHILL EYET|QOE

Yourself" and more oblique
subtleties of "When the Night
Comes_Falling." All of these
songs were propelled by the
four gospel-belting "Queens of

voices elevated the band "and
Dylan to new"dynamic heights.

The Heartbreakers as a
whole, however, positively
overplayed on some Dylan

the strain of the band's overly
loud poundings. Nevertheless,
Mike Campbell's guitar solo on
that song was dazzling. "Like a

Rolling Stone" seemed to rock .

more than it rolled. With three

electric guitars chiming away at -

the song's ascending bass note
riff, the more breezy and rollick-
ing quality of the original version
was lost.

However, "Knockin' on
Heaven's Door" took on an epic
and anthemic stature. The dirge—

greatest pieces, is concerned

They began, in fact, as no more
than an obnoxious and confus-
ing hardcore band following
Black Flag around America and
Europe like an annoying kid
brother.

In the four or so years that
have elapsed since then,
singer/guitarist Curt Kirkwood,
his brother and bass player Cris
and drummer Derrick Bostrom
have changed and evolved as
a band. They progressed steadi-
ly; pursuing different sounds and
attitudes. The chaotic, thrashing
/l/leat Puppets was followed
soon by the acidy, moody but
playful /\_/leat Puppets II. If any
half-disillusioned hardcores hung
hopefully on after //, they surely
fled with last year's Up On the
Sun. This is a stunning record —
complex, murky rock ’n' roll that
after a time blooms into
something utterly positive and
unique. lt succeeded well out-
side the conventions of popular
music and improves with age.

This summer, the Puppets
released a new record, Out/Vly
Way. It is their most straightfor-
ward, rock ’n' roll-oriented
record thus far, as well as their
most accessible. There are only
five new songs on Out My
Way, but they are substantial,
welcome additions to the Pup-
pets’ already expansive psychic
playground. The sound is big-
ger, more forceful and initially
"more striking than in any of their
previous records.. lt’s still not
your average kitsch but it does
have a , melodic, toe—tapping
charm to it. Imagine The
Grateful Dead produced by ZZ
Top. Then imagine what they
could do if they had some im-
agination and guts. That's a vi-
sion that should put you in the
neighborhood of Out/\/ly Way.

The songs all vary in style to
a degree but they are bound by
a certain attitude and
recklessness. The first song,
”She’s Hot" would be the ob-

vious radio single. Because it is
so upbeat and lyrically ridiculous
She’s hot / know/She's hot/She
to/a’ me so — it's a good open-
ing song and sign of things to
come.

"Not Swimming Ground" and
"Mountain Line" both on the se-
cond side, are two more
unusua//y jumpin' songs on the
record. ”l\lot Swimming
Ground," which refers to the
most popular song on their last

album, could be more accurate-
ly titled "A Rock ’n' Roll Varia-
tion on the Peanuts Theme."
And then there's "Mountain
Line,” which begins like some
southern rock anthem and
degenerates(?) into a hiccuping
"Sugar Magnolia" mutation.
This song also sports one of the
‘more happy-go-lucky guitar
solos you're ever likely to hear.
Then, on the less rambling
side, there is. the title track and
”Other Kinds of Love” which
are more easily understood in
relation to Up On the Sun. Out
My Way is much less iumpin’
but very wide-open sounding.
Curt's pleasantly droning voice
stretches, often for miles, across
the rhythmic chord progressions.
Its simple structure
monotone vocals are strange
and somehow alluring. ”Other
Kinds of Love,” however, is a
denser, more atmospheric
piece. lt’s nearly akin to Syd
Barrett's Pink Floyd with its
back round noises and ethereal
moo .

Which bringsus to the end
and a romping, guttural rendition

’ of ”Good Golly Miss Molly.”

This, I suppose, is The Puppets
way of publically touching base
with The Great Spirit and dispell-
ing any doubts about their abili-
ty to get down. No, the Meat
Puppets are not short an ability
or creativity. However, they
may be in need of a new name,
which is the only thing that will
stand between them and the
recognition they deserve. V

The first thing I wondered
when l heard that Genesis was
releasing a new album was
whether it would sound like Phil
Collins or Mike and the
Mechanics. ’

Phil Collins is, of course,
Genesis’ lead singer and drum-
mer who also has been known

to do some solo work. Mike and s

the Mechanics, meanwhile, is
the group headed by Genesis
guitarist Mike Rutherford.

When I heard The album-
opening Title track from /nvisib/e

like Phil Collins.” Then l heard
the rest of The album, and l said,
”Hey, this is Genesis.”

Perhaps Phil Collins could
have included ”|nvisible Touch”
on his No Jacket Required LP,
but Then what would Genesis
have called This album?

The rest of the album is easily
recognizable as Genesis,
however, with a heavy
dependence on Tony Banks’
keyboards. ”TonighT, To_night,
Tonight" is classic Genesis that
makes one recall The trio's last
effort released in l983, simply
called Genesis.

Although all Three band
members have been extremely
busy with outside interests, There
is no evidence of burnout on This
album. Also, one cannot deny it
would be easy for Genesis to
sound like a Phil Collins solo or

Mike and The Mechanics‘

' throughout The entire album, but
. with The exception of ”lnvisib|e
‘ Touch,” They seem to elude that

obstacle.

Genesis is not Phil Collins and
it is not Mike and The Mechanics.
It is Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford
and Tony Banks. Genesis is
Genesis and The /nvisib/e Touch
LP is Genesis at Their best.

THE LEAGUE OF CRAFTY
GUITARISTS LIVE!
Robert Fripp,

E.G. Editions

My fondest recollection of
Robert Fripp was during a lec-
ture in The Claymont Mansion
Ballroom. A mosquito, like a Tiny,
animated specimen of oriental
handiwork, floated around his
eyebrow. He spoke in an
earnest, but amused Wimborne
clip, lightly waving at The
marauder in his brow. He is
without a doubt The gentlest man
I know. Which may come as a
surprise to Those familiar with The

‘holocaustal sounds of King

Crimson.

The Claymont Mansion is
situated on a farm in West
Virginia, near H_'arper’s Ferry,
and is where part of The perfor-
mance pieces on The new record
were recorded. Fripp is a cons-
cientious man in a corrupt and
abusive industry. Claymont
Court is where he reconciles his
relationship To the more deter-
mined members of his listening
crowd. In rock ’n’ roll, like
politics, it is more common for a
star to be The object of

what they would have been had
I been seated in the Abbey
Road studios with the Beatles
during the making of the original
White A/bum tracks.

If this record is intended to
document, rather than to repre-
sent, then I think it fulfills its pur-
pose. The improvisations
demonstrate the very high
degree of organization which
can be attained by the
Fripp/Crafty method in concert.
The spirit of the record, despite
some downrig-ht miserable
moments, is that of a winged
heart. l found fault only in the
use of Frippertronics on the
record, which were added
wholey, and in no manner what-
soever represent the work of the
Crafties.

Frippertronics are Fripp’s
adventure into the modes and

 

 

techniques of Steve Reich and
Phillip Glass. lt is the use_of in-

teracting rhythmic structures for
a surface texture on which to im-

provise and belong to the

l979—8l period of Fripp’s
career, when he distanced
himself from the corporate rock
world with a series of intimate
and poorly attended (by car-
porate standards) concerts, the
best of which was at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania.

Fripp, the odd, demented
Englishman, has exceeded
every competitor in music and
every thinker in philosophy that
l have ever heard, read or
known. But nobody's perfect.

"Built for the Future” is the

vocalist Cy Curnin sings in the
follow-up hit to the album's first
single, ”Secret Separation," but
it's built for the future.

Yes, indeed.

It seems we will no longer hear
the ”Are We Ourselves?"—type
of music that this British act first
introduced us to in the early '80s
when they relied heavily on Cur-
nin's vocal abilities. lnstead, The
Fixx now seems to have shifted
its focus to the talents of the
musicians in the band, especial-
ly guitarist Jamie West-Oram.

lnstead of Curnin dominating
the album like he has on the
band's past efforts, he now
complements the music.

ln terms of lyrics, it is an album
with a very positive attitude in
regard to the future. Some say
the reason for this is because
both Curnin and West—Oram
recently celebrated the birth of
their first children.

The. Fixx wants to build for the
future, and widespread success
could be in The Fixx's future. lf
this album catches on, the future
could be now.

LIKE A Rock  
Bob Seger and The
Silver Bullet Band

capitol Records

This album may not have the
same effect on the American
public that Bruce Springsteen's
Born in the U.S.A. had last year,
but it’ deserves to.

Seger has again released a
powerful album. lt is a strong
comeback after his last effort,
The Distance, which was re-
leased in early i983. The
Distance was a good effort, but
.it does not compare to like a
Pack.

Like a Rock is more easily com-
pared to Seger’s late '70s pro-
ject Against the .Wind. Like
Against the Wind, like a Rock is
fast—paced and easily recog-
nizable as a Seger project. All
the songs except two were writ-
ten by Seger. The exceptions
are "Tightrope" and "The
Aftermath," which Seger co-
wrote with Silver Bullet key-
boardist Craig Frost.

The title track from the album
is a classic mid-tempo Seger
ballad. lt and ”i\/liami,” which
features ex—Eagle Don Henley,
are the only mellow songs on the
entire album. The rest, including
local favorites "American
Storm" and "Sometimes," are
upbeat

Seger fans have been waiting
for this album impatiently for
several years now. Evidently
they approve, especially in Pitts-
burgh. On Aug. 7, Seger sold
out two shows scheduled for
Sept. l l-l 2 at the Civic Arena
(over 32,000 tickets) in less than
eight hours. ln short, Bob Seger
is back. . P '

Billy Joel

pose, Billy Joel neatly per-
sonifies the word unfashionable.
He longs to be taken seriously,
hoping to be considered a big

the same breath as a James

again, the diminutive piano
pounder comes up short.

because The Bridge is Joel's

cond is ”Code df-Silence” with

a chorus that practically takes
flight with Cyndi Lauper’s soar-

his return to the well traveled
theme of ”Running on lce,"
wherein the old-fashioned guy
becomes lost in the automated
age. Most annoying is Joel's
falsetto on the iazzy ”Big Man

his batting average to about

Van Morrison

Mercury

The continuing vitality of Van
Morrison is astonishing. /\/o
Guru is reminiscent of his l9o9
classic Astra/ Weeks in its con-
sistency of texture. Van rarely
strays from the path of Celtic
soulfulness expressed on the disc
opening ”Got to Go Back.” This
performance neatly condenses
the sense of longing for home
that has echoed through his
work for over 20 years. Mor-
rison's voice has improved with
age like a fine rose. His gruff
bellowing belies the warmth and
wisdom of a great prophet and
his vocals are easily the domi-
nant instrument on this album.

Columbia

The loud crash that you heard
near the end of July was the

Knocked Out is an album.with

zconsistency of’-sound; ’’They
' Killed Him" is a Kris Kristoferson-
penned rehash of ”Abraham, ‘

Martin and John” that follows a
colossal and stiff blues shuffle
called ”You Wanna Ramble.”
The hodgepodge continues a
few songs later with ”Precious
Memories," a typically flat
white man's attempt at reggae.

Dylan only comes to life with
"Got My Mind Made Up."

With its modified Bo Diddly beat .

and Mike Campbell's searing
bottleneck guitar, this Dylan-
Petty effort gives'Dylan a rare
opportunity to howl with a pur-
pose on Knocked Out. lt almost
makes the whole effort worth
nine bucks. Almost, but not

WORLD OF WONDERS
Bruce cockburn
MCA

No longer an acoustic folkie
stranded in the Canadian
wilderness, Bruce Cockburn has
become the globally conscious
singer/songwriter of the decade.

‘World continues in the same-

vein as last year's inspired Steal-
ing Fire, with its clever juxtaposi-
tion of erotic and mystical love
songs with sharp-edged indict-
ments of U.S. foreign policy.

After lo albums, Cockburn’s_

musical dexterity has peaked.
"See How I Miss You” features
rich horn work, while ”Santiago
Dawn” and ”Dancing in
Paradise" feature Cockburn on
the charango. The charango is
a stringed instrument from the

' Andes that uses an armadillo

shell as a soundbox. lt’s an in-
strument as harmonious and
distinctive as the singer himself.
This album should not be missed.

Muffy’s

Meal

The taste of the Towers

By Mufty

Welcome back to all returning
Pitt people, and hello! to all Pitt
freshman.

My name is Muffy, and l am
beginning my school year, as
well as yours, with a new addi-
tion to our glorious school
newspaper. lt will be referred to
as "Muffy's Meal" and more
commonly known around the of-
fice as the restaurant review.

 

For those of you who are
returning to Pitt, you may have
experienced some restaurants
that l will be reviewing this year.
But don't give up  l am a
native Pittsburgher and have
years of experience with
restaurants, and places that call
themselves restaurants. I will
hopefully find places that are
new to you.

My first assignment, and ap-
propriately so, is the Towers
cafeteria. OK, OK, some of you
have to eat there because you
are on the meal plan, but for
those of you who don't have to,
it may be a nice change.

Lunch costs a mere $2.95 and
dinner only $4.50. Our illustrious
restaurant serves their meals buf-
fet style — you can go back as
many times as you'd like. There
is a salad bar, a soup bar and
a beverage serving station.

I know it's not mom's cooking,
but hey, it's a great place to
scope!

There are many specialty
nights when fancier cuisine is
served. Of course, you have to
wait until a holiday such as
Halloween for an evening like
this to occur, but the upgraded
chow and the created at-
mosphere are well worth the
wait.

The towers cafeteria rates a
C+. The plus is because the
people there do try. Remember,
if you are nice to the line ladies,
they will be nice to you too.

Off ’til next time. ‘

The prepster, Muffy.

Muf'Fy’s Grading System:

A+ —- Expensive, but terrific. A
Real Atmosphere.

A — Close to A+, but not quite
as great.

B + —— Moderately_priced, fits,in-
to the collegiate budget.

B — A little less expensive, good
food.

B— — Cheaper, but still worth it.
C+ — Decent food, inex-

Born Free
Exotic Atrican cuisine

By Ruth Auscern

When Mr. and Mrs. Fulton,
Pittsburgh natives, decided that
the city needed a restaurant that
was ”a little different,” they‘
bought a few African
cookbooks, learned some
recipes and set up housekeeping
in a converted rowhouse on
Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside,
precariously close to the East
Busway. The result is Born Free,
a restaurant with a dining ex-
perience every bit as exciting as
its conception.

The atmosphere of the
restaurant is simple. In fact, the
building itself is easy to miss.
Located on a sparsely
populated residential street with
only a small sign announcing the
name, Born Free is hardly a
place to attract a walk-in crowd.
Within, this attitude of under-
statement is charming. Rather
than the gaudy and only mar-
ginally authentic looking art that
is the pitfall of many ethnic.
restaurant interiors, here the
walls are dark wood with only
a few paintings and masks. And

the place is small, not more than
a dozen tables in what were
once a living room and
basement.

The service is the most enter-_
taining aspect of a dinner at Born
Free. The owners also cook and
wait tables. Their pride in the
restaurant is evident; interested
customers need only ask to hear
about the restaurant, the menu,
the owners’ trip to Africa and the
ingredients. When my party and
I asked about" a specific spice,
the owner went straight to the
kitchen to show it to us. The
other side of this level of per-
sonal attention is that Born Free
is no place to go for a quick din-
ner. Despite that fact that no
more than four tables were fill-
ed at any time, we spent almost

. three hours over dinner, though

it was a nice change to eat in a
place so small and leisurely that
we were not hurried out.

The same attention to quality
and detail is shown in the cook-
ing. All the food, from bread to
ice cream, is homemade and the
meat ‘is purchased daily and
never frozen. Despite the fact

 

that the menu is not extensive,
everything sounds so unfamiliar
and delicious on paper that it is
hard to choose. We ended up
starting with cold strawberry
mint soup ($l.50). Although it
looked and sounded like a
dessert, this was a sharp and

tangy beginning to the meal. . ’ ‘

Our appetizers were the
Camarao Grelhado Piri Piri
($5.25) from Mozambique,
Ceviche ($3.80) from Ghana
and Fried Plantain Cubes
($2.00) from West Africa. The

first was shrimp, broiled in hot  T. 
chili, garlic and peanut oil, very

THE SMITHS
The Fulton Theater
August I2, I986

By John Mccombe

He might iust die with a
smile on his face. Though it
was apparent from the
show's‘o ener that l\/Iorrissey
is ”Still ll ,” a slight remission
or even a recovery seems
possible. The wordsmith from
Manchester, England, clutch-
ed his mike stand with inten-
sity and emoted with barely
a trace of self—pity. He even
barked a bit too lustily on
”Frankly lvlr. Shankly” from
the new The Queen is Dead
album. The support offered
by lvlarr and Co. left for too
much empty space for l\/lor-
rissey to fill with his creed of
renewed faith in life and love.

The performance peaked
early with the resounding Bo
Diddly thud and Iatticework

 

guitars of "How Soon is
Now.” Never has there been
a greater example of the
power of unreleased tension.
The evening's award for the
song most neatly rescued
from a bog of self-
righteousness was claimed
late in the evening. "Meat is
Murder,” dedicated "to all
you Pittsburgers" was
transformed from the album
version's slap of the hand to
a savage condemnation. of
”the flesh you so fancifully
fry." I waited a full 48 hours
before downing a piece of
barbequedchicken.

What a spectacle it all
was. Marr, Joyce, Rourke
and an additional rhythm
guitarist remained motionless
while lvlorrissey pirouetted,
showered his fans with flower

petals and collapsed into a
heap onto the stage of the
Fulton. At times, the singer

~ spun himself dizzily in circles

at center stage. He reminded
me of Julie Andrews frollick-
ing in the meadows of The
Sound of Music.

The evening roared to its
conclusion as hoards of
I4-year—old ‘girls and boys
stormed the stage during
”Hand in Glove,” the,Smiths
debut U.K. single. It was a fit-
ting conclusion to an evening
that was a testimonial to the
power of pop music.'l\/lor-
rissey cracked a broad smile
and waved goodnight to the
delirious throng. He seemed
to think about life and about
death. At that moment, life
seemed to particularly appeal
to him.

The rest of the meal followed

tasted almost ltalian, was
followed by a separate course
of pineapple and peppermint

entree to refresh the palate. For

the sauces were exciting but

sweet mixture of curry, coconut
and Calvados and the prawns
sauteed and dipped in spiced
