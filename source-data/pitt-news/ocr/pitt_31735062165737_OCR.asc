Navy Sec’y

Assistant. Secretary of the Navy

-for Research and Development,

Dr. James H. Wakelin, Jr., will
present an address concerning
“opportunities for the creative
mind in University life,” Greek
Week theme at the Greek Week
Banquet, and will develop the idea
of working for the federal gov-
ernment. The banquet will be
held February 9 at noon, in the
SU Ballroom.

Since 1939 Dr. Wakelin has been
working on various research proj-
ects, both for the government and
for private industry.

Started ,At B. F. Goodrich

At the Physical Research De-
partment of the B. F. Goodrich
Company, where he started in the
scientiﬁc ﬁeld, Dr. Wakelin
worked on the structure and phy-
sical properties of natural and
synthetic rubber, and with x-ray
diffraction and /electron micro-
scope studies of high polymers.

Aside from other activities in

the scientiﬁc ﬁeld as a Lieuten-
ant Commander in the United
States Naval Reserve during
1945 to 1946, Dr. Wakelin was
active in the planning and "or-
ganization of the Navy’s pro-
gram to sponsor basic scien-
tiﬁc research. This program is
now under the direction of the
Oﬂice of Naval Research.

Dr. Wakelin’s most recent ac-
tivities include heading the United
States delegation to the Intergov-
ernmental Conference on Oceano-
graphic Research in 1960 and the
United States delegation to the
ﬁrst sesion of the Intergovern-
mental Oceanographic‘ Commision
in 1961.

His current science post is the
chairmanship of the Federal
Council for Science and Technol-
ogy’s Interagency Commission on
Oceanography. -

Studied at Cambridge

A graduate of Dartmouth Col-
lege, where he received an A.B.
_degree in physics, Dr. Wakelin
earned a B.A. and an M.A. in the
natural sciences at Cambridge
University, Cambridge, England.
He later specialized in the ﬁeld of
ferro-magnetism at Yale Univer-

For Brother-Sister Program

The Brother-Sister orienta-
tion program of the Interna-
tional Student Committee
will formalize its plans Mon-
day with applications avail-
able for American students
interested in participating. Can-
didates may -pick up forms at the
SU desk, student and information

The program, one of the-_origi-
nal suggestions in Student Gov-
ernment plans. for a foreign stu-

dividual American students to
orient each foreign student to the
University on -a personal basis.

Aimlessness
Main Target

By KATHIE EDWARDS
(See Column, Page Four)

“I see I have exactly 411/2
minutes to change the politi-
cal destiny of the University
of Pittsburgh,” began William
F. Buckly, Jr., a leading ex-
ponent of conservatism, sen-

ior. editor of The National Review,
and author’of four books, speak-

ing at the Midday Series Friday.‘

Amid laughter in the jammed
SU Ballroom, Buckley went on to
discuss the aimlessness of Ameri-
can education.

“It is harder and harder to ﬁnd
anyone who is able or willing to
defend progressive education,” he
declared, “and to protest against
the dehumanization of the species.
Freshly trained intellectual ﬁght-
ers are needed, for the ﬁnal vic-
tory is not assumed.”

Students Treated

universities in America treat stu-
dents as “half-rational biological

he’ll show him the‘ campus, intro-
duce him to his friends and other
foreign students, the community
and our customs.”

Diomedes Liu, a Burmese
student who is co-chairman of
the International Student Com-
mittee with Carrol Smith,
stressed the beneﬁts of the pro-
gram to both American and for-
eign students.

“The _ American students
learn about other countries’
tures, especially important
with America’s increased con-
cern for foreign -affairs. It is -a
good step for interested students to
partake of these activities while
they’re in school.”

At the same time the foreign
students “feel a need for this pro-
gram. When they ﬁrst learn of
their acceptance. to this Univer-
sity they lookvforward . with en-
thusiasm to ‘learning »a technical

An engineering and mines freshman can now have a
1.5 Quality Point Average and still remain at_ ‘the University
as long as he raises it to a 2.0 overall Q.P.A. by the time he
has accummulated 72 credits, according to Walter R. Turkes,
associate dean of the school of Engineering and Mines.

The changing, of the probation

Who just needs a little time to
come along academically.” The
requirements under the new sys-
tem, however, are the same — no
student is graduated who has. less
‘than a 2.0 average. ‘

“In Liberal Arts a student
must maintain a 2.0 QPA to stay
in the University,” Dean”I‘urkes
stated-’ “He (the student) is
given three _ terms to get that
average. I feel that the engin-
eering student should be given
more leeway.

“Most engineering students are
taking 16 or more credits each
trimester, while many Liberal
Arts students take 14 or so. En-
gineering courses are also mor

graduated approach,” Dean Turk-
es ‘continued. “It is also a little
more liberal. It takes an engin-
eering student about four terms
to get the 72 credits.”

Dean Turkes also emphasized
the engineering students need
144 credits to graduate while LA
students need 124. LA students
may consider up to 12 credits
of ROTC in their graduation re-
quirement, but engineering stu-
dents may consider only two
credits in place of a gym course.

Student reaction to this change
has been varied. Jim Falk, a jun-
ior chemical engineering major,
said that “since the freshman who
can’t maintain a 2.0 QPA will pro-

bably fail out sooner or later any-
way.

Basically. Liberal Arts
“The freshman engineers course
is basically liberal arts. Engin-
eering graphics is the only engin-
eering course given and-you can
fail that and still have over a 2.0
QPA. Many engineering students,
however, have a great difficulty
with such liberal arts subjects as
English and political science
which account for greater than

' one third of the freshman curric-

ulum. For these students, ,it is
good.” '

“It appears to be good for the
student who starts off on the
wrong foot and can change and

' raise his grades,” William Sch-

neider, senior chemical engin-
eering major, said. “This way
thestudent can still maintain
good academic standing.”

Larry Tavlarides, president of
Engineering and Mines Cabinet
and a senior chemical ‘engineering
major, explained that many engin-
eering students do well in engin-
eering courses -and not in liberal
arts courses. “Their QPA’s may

Use Talents Better

“This lowering enaoies a stu-
dent who is slow in the liberal
arts courses to remain in the
School of Engineering and Mines
where he can utilize his talents to
produce a QPA greater than 2.0

‘by taking engineering courses.”

Dean Turkes feels “that the ob-
jective of the School of Engineer-
ing and Mines, as well as, every
school, is to endeavor to keep the
student in the school, not to try to
be as rough and tough as pos-
sible.”

Prior to this change the eight

departmentswhich make up the
School of Engineering and Mines
had different standards. The de-
partment heads studied the prob-
lem over the summer and reached
the present decision in July. The
new system became effective last
September.

The committee of department
heads have studied the systems of
other schools of engineering. Dean
Turkes concluded. “The graduated
approach is quite .common.”

Buckley Calls Education

‘Aimless’; Wants ‘Fighters’

beings,” but people blindly con-
tinue to send their children there,
“just as na-tives used to cling to
the tribal witchdoctor.”

“All college presidents sound
the same and make the same
kind of speeches,” Buckley con-
tinued. “Right from the cliche.
factory. Educators are coming to
know what education is not, but
they can’t decide what it is be-
cause they-won’t harken to the
aims of progressive education.

“The world of education has
been cut asunder by a profound
sense of incompleteness,” ob-
served Buckley. He pointed out
that the educated elite are not at
all agreed upon the problems of
education, let alone the solution.

Usually Wrong

“When they do appear to be
taking a fairly combined stand,

’ they are usually wrong,” he said.

“If educators cannot arrive at a
consensus, the lmasses, certainly
cannot be expected to -arrive at
one.

“I would rather live in a
society governed by the ﬁrst E
200 names’ in Boston’s telephone
directory than 200 Harvard fac-
ulty members. '_Those who clam-
or for brave "new solutions ‘usu-
ually give more time to clamor-
ing than, to actually ﬁnding the
solution.” 4

Buckley Pointed out-. that the
aims of education must be stated
more intelligibly to change the
present ways of education. “This
can't be done,” he declared, “until
the modern idea of “academic
freedom’ is done away with. The

main aim of education is. to for- A
‘ward right conduct, but at the ex- A

pense of certain outworn ideas.”
Buckley. then stressed the point

A that colleges should never‘ be neu-

tral. “When colleges give up neu-
trality, a substantial victory will
be won.” He added that “per-
haps it will be the student who

. accomplishes this; perhaps the.
student will be the agent of
reform.”

Bearing Standards

 Changing the "probation level for Engineering freshmen
from the usual 2.0 to 1.5 is a daring manner of dealing with
aproblem which has long plagued the school: an alarming
number of students simply do not make it through the En-
gineering course. i

The associate dean of the School of Engineering and

the approach . . . a change with the ultimate goal-maintain-

 . . . (and) the graduate (or) more liberal approach”.

 ‘But it still appears that standards have been lowered,

*no matter which way one chooses to look at it.

 '' At a time when the University is priding itself on its
increased admission standards, it seems quite surprising

that-the E and M schoolwould make such a decision.

-. , And at a time when the Chancellor is stressing again
and-again the importance of students receiving well-round-
ed, liberal educations, it is even more surprising that the
standards have been dropped, according to the editor of the
, Skyscraper Magazine, because “many students have a great
Vjdifliculty with such liberal arts courses as English and
Vpolitical science which account for greater than one third
 of the. freshmen curriculum.”

 Even though Dean Turkes feels the engineering stu-
dent should “be given more leeway” because he often takes
more credits and needs more to graduate than_does the
liberal arts student, lowering the freshman probation level
will, in no way, raise the student’s desire to work harder. It
is conceivable that it even may give some students a false
sense of security, because they know they have four terms
inwhich to “pull themselves up.” '

The great number of students who have found them-

“slow s_tarters.—” Every school at the University has its slow
starters; and it must be accepted that slow starters are
ffusually slow ﬁnishers.

, "If it is liberal art courses which are hampering the
{engineering student, then this is no excuse. The stereotype
}of the inarticulate, semi-literate “injineer” — no matter how
H: exaggerated it is —-— is something to be ashamed of.

j The professional man who is not oriented to the arts is
I not an educated man; he is merely a trained technician.

 News

 
 

In my conversations with my fellow students
and with the American families I have visited I
have found out that very few of them get an op-
portunity to see much of this country. I feel that
most of these people have '
missed some of the best ex-
periences of their lives. Amer-
ica is a vast and diverse country
and the true beauty of it cannot
be captured by a movie or tele-
vision camera. I also feel that a
student attending college is in‘
the best possible circumstances
to be able to venture upon such ~
an undertaking. I further be-
lieve that such trips must be
made in the company of one’s
friends and classmates.

The University sponsors a trip to Europe dur-
ing the summer for the more fortunate students
and I am told they are very successful in orienting
American students toward the customs and tradi-
tions of these European nations. I feel that such ex-
cursions are very valuable but I also feel that such
an educational undertaking should start at home. I

. believe that the University should sponsor such

trips to numerous places of interest within the
U.S. itself. ‘

An Indian Example ,
My college in India for example, sponsored two
such trips .annually to various tourist attractions in

/.

India. Very few students living .in Bombay have‘

occasion to visit the ‘Taj Mahal, ﬁfteen hundred
miles away, yet thousands of ,tourists ‘ﬂock every
year to View the most expensive monument to a
lady- Through college sponsorship these students
are able to enjoy the beauty of Taj’ by moonlight.

I think the same can be said about tourist at-
tractions like the Grand Canyon National Park or
Mt. Rushmore in the United States- ‘Few feel the
zeal to embark upon such a strenuous journey later
in life with a wife and family, but, given an op-
portunity to take in the sights ‘during their college
life, they would seize the chance. ' g

A few enterprising students maydo the sight-

seeing on their own during/summer but the real
fun of the excursion comes from sharing the ex-
perience with others. The cost of a group under-
taking is also less than that of just a few roughing
it together. A chartered bus, for example, would
provide very economical and some of those who
could not afford to see the country on their own
would be able to join. / i

I am informed that some high schools have a
senior class outing which usually turns out to be a
trip to Washington D.C. I know little about such
trips but would say that what I’have in mind is
an extension of this type of program to a nation-
wide tour at the college level.

Through_ my experiences in the United States I
have found that, during vacations, most dormitor-
ies at local.colleges are empty and are available
free or for a very modest sum. In India the trans-
portation company provide special rates for student
travel and, in addition, provides other services
such as arranging the guides. ‘

Getting _'|'o Know You

Such trips, I have seen, also afford anexcellem.
opportunity for students to know their fellows
and faculty members better. One may meet a stu-
dent in the classes daily or" be on a ﬁrst name
basis with a faculty member, but one’ can not really
claim to know, them intimately. unless _they' are
one’svroom mate. -In a large city institution such
as the University this orientatioln "takes ‘-place for
only a certain segment of the‘University commun-
ity; such sightseeing trips would serve to bring-the
students closer together -and also-‘to improve the
student—faculty communications.

It is wellto know in this modern world how‘

the other half lives, but I,feel it is far more im-
portant‘ to learn about _ones"own country ﬁrst, "and
I feel that -the University should investigate —a

means for starting trips within the’ United States.

and then give the matter‘ serious thought The
gentleman who says that he’ has never been out
of the"Pi_ttsburgh area is not really proud of the
fact’ and if given an opportunity to remedy the
situation’, he, ‘I am sure, will willingly take it. '

Those who speak before college audiences
should, always remember that their listeners are
generally more intelligent, more exact, and more
critical than the everyday public gathering. Stu-
dents today demand substance '
and meaning. in lectures, and
they are not satisﬁed with dema-
gogic tricks ‘nor impressed with
eloquent verbiage alone. Mr.
William F. Buckley Jr., forgot
these crucial facts when he de-
livered his address on Friday. ,

Sifting through Mr. Buckley’s
circumlocuted remarks requires.
many man-hours, and the prod-
ucts of such labor may not be
worth the effort. The topic for -
the lecture was the “Aimlessness of American
Education.” Starting with‘ the college president,
down through the administration to the faculty,
Mr. Buckley ﬁnds a “sameness” in their plans and
policies. A “c1iche’ factory” has been in operation
for some time, turning out reams of propaganda
on “Academic Freedom” and “Liberal Education.”
The colleges of America have sacriﬁced their per-
suasive role to serve as a mere umpire between
conﬂicting concepts and ideas.

‘Reserve Your Judgment

Further, Mr. Buckley argues, knowledge is not
always the key to wisdom; intellectual joys are
not very palpable; and intellectual arrogance is
to be feared. Certainly we can all see some truth in
these statements,‘ but we shouldreserve our judg-
ment on Mr. Buckley until we hear what his solu-

tion to this “aimlessness” is. His answer is “Aim” ,.

instead of aimlessness, indoctrination instead of
“doctrinal parity”, and advocacy instead of neu-
trality. Further, Mr. Buckley appears to know the
answers right down the line.

Traditions and the past are the answers to the
colleges- You can’t decide on what should be
taught? Simple!~What you have learned in the past

cannot be surpassed by what you will learn'in the’

future. One doctrine must be urged over another.

Were among the , many present at the lecture,
several facts become clear. to you:

Determined the Point

First, Mr.‘,Buckley _has determined the point in
history at which human curiosity and questioning
must end. We can discover nothing new in politics,
ethics, or philosophy that is worthy. Luckily for us

that this date was not before 1776, -or we wouldn’t

have a representative democracy; or before 1861, or

we wouldn’t have racial equality; or. before 1925,»

or we wouldn’t have -been able to believe_ The
National Review.

Second, Mr- Buckley, has set down the infallible
rules of life and learning, untouched by liberal
hands, where we will abide by our father’s teach-
ings alone. -

Third, Mr. Buckley proves that it is unneces-
sary to be the son of an oilman or the son of a
department store owner to be “conservative.”
Simply deny the abilities of your fellow human
beings, accept that which is told you without
questioning, and, above all, learn. to evade the is-
sues which divide men. Be, as Max Lerner put it,
“weak-minded” and carry ‘the flag of a True Be-

“aberr ion”, ofrnankin -and a deplo loflre-__,

-I Helping a group of friendswho
were on a student Union Board
dance committee eventually led to
the presidency of SUB for senior
Forrest Cross. '

Forrest, better _known in dmost
University circles as “Woody,” re-
called that “some friends asked
for help on a record dance. They
needed someone to play. records
and make announcements.”
Before that, Woody never had
any intention of joining SUB. Like

sure of its exact function.
Woody Worked

«That dance started Woody
working and, by this year, he ‘had
worked on the dance committee
and the special events committee,
been an informal member» of sev-
eral committees, and then “just
went right on _the board,” in his
words, to ultimately become pres-
ident.

As SUB president, Woody is
a liason -between the admini-
stration and student organiza-
tions. Miss Doreen Dorsey, SUB
advisor, deemed Woody “most
amendable, almost to the point
of being pacifying. This helps to
maintain the even keel Woody
would like to see the SUB run-
ning on.” .
.Woody, in keeping with this,
does not .take much personal
credit. He asserted that “the kids
do most of the Work. I just cement
things together and ﬁnd out what
the others (committees and com-
mittee heads) are doing.” As an
afterthought, he inserted, “I also
make the bigger decisions con-
cerning the allocation of money
and things to_ be done.”

Valuable Experience
Stressed, too, was Woody’s feel-
ing that this “experience on the
SUB was very valuable. The stu-
dents and faculty members work-

many students, he was not even

ing on the board are willing to
give more than most.” ‘
Talking in a more personal
vein, Woody commented that
“on the SUB you learn how to
get along with people and how
to react to different situations.”
_ This is a lesson Woody appears
to have learned well. Miss Irene
Hordubary, SUB ofﬁce secretary,
ﬁnds that “although Woody «is
very moody, and at times, impa-
tient, as a rule he is ‘very friendly
and easy—going. He is very nice. I
like him very much personally
and think a lot of him.”
High Opinion
Tom Mellers, SUB member, also
holds a very high opinion of
Woody. He observed that “Woody
co-ordinates very well. In meet-
ings he odesn’t hesitate to stand
up for what he thinks, but does
not do it in an offensive manner.

SUB, however, is not Woody’s
only interest at the University.
This trimester’s pledge master of
Delta Sigma Tau social fraternity,
he also is a member of Tap Day
committee and Parents’ Weekend
committee in addition to holding
the post of student chairman of
the Constitution Ball of the 175th
Anniversary committee. Last year,
Woody was a member of Parents’
Weekend committee, co-chairman
of Tap Day committee, and on
Student Government.

Following his April graduation,
Woody plans on entering “some
type of graduate school in the
pharmacy field.” ,

Review 0f"Letting Go’ c

Roth Creates Tragic Figure

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Philip Roth's first full-length
novel, Letting Go (Random
House; 630 pp; $5.95), has 108911
compa1'ed’back and forth to his
novelet short story collection,
Goodbye Columbus. But since that
book made such a name for its
author, let's continue the compari-
son for a moment.

The first book was riotously
funny, excruciatingly painful, was
about Jews but still quite uni-
versal and, above all, Told the
Truth. All these things can also
be said about Letting Go.

So much for comparisons. This
book can and should stand alone.
Because it is an outstanding book.

Protagonist Like Himself

Roth‘s protagonist, like himself,
is a Jewish college instructor. The
Story is not always centered on
Gabe Wallach, but all of the char-
acters have their effect on him.

For it is other people that
make Wall-aeh what he is. It is
‘plainly stated that other people
are Gabe’s problems. He has
none of his own; he doesn't
even have to work for a living.

But, because of the kind of
man he is, he continually be-
comes involved. At the beginning
of the novel, he is warned by his
dying mother not to interfere in
other people’s lives. But how can
one help a man who is down
without interfering?

Way

The man who is down is Paul
Herz, a fellow teacher. Her’/. is
really physically battered about
on the tides of life: he marries
Libby, a Gentile, and draws the
wrath of his narrow Brook-
lynese family down on him for
life; he quits teaching to work in
a plant to support himself; he is
forced to spend his last penny
on an abortion for his wife and is
almost blackmailed t'or it; Libby,
meanwhile, proves to be forever
frail and nervous and can no long-
er have children; Paul decides to
leave his wife after five years of
poverty. stagriatioii and Libby’s

himself to do even that; he turns

He does, admittedly, get carried’

away with those Rothisms which
marked his earlier stories:
man who had a fatal heart attack
while riding his lawnmower and
was dragged all over the neigh-

borhood; the little boy strapped to
the commode; the little boy who
said “who?” to everything said to
him; the woman who tried to
drown herself in the toilet; the old
man who stockpiled underwear.

Over 600 pages of this strange
sort of humor is much too much.
But the real warm humor of Roth,
and his truthful pen make this
book exceptional. _

THE BELL TELEPHOANTE COMPANIES
SALUTE: TONY DIGIOIA

Tony DiGioia (RS, 1960) , in less than two years, became
supervisor in one of the Test Centers in the Plant Depart-
ment of Pennsylvania Bell. He manages ﬁfteen people
who are responsible for the installation and repair of
53,000 telephones in the area.

Tony should handle his present assignment with his
customary thoroughness, when you consider his first two
assignments. Shortly after starting work, he proved his

 

capabilities by organizing .a completely new microﬁlm
ﬁling system in the Engineering Department. And, later,
he set up engineering practices covering many phases of

the engineering operation.

Tony DiCioia and other young engineers like him in
Bell Telephone Companies throughout the country help
bring the ﬁne-st communications service in the world to '
the homes and businesses of a growing America.

The Spartan’s high ranking is
somewhat of a surprise since they
have a young team. Their prob-

able starting lineup has only one

senior, with two juniors and ﬁve
sophomores.

The lone senior is 177—pounder
Alex Valcanoff, who has posted a
4-0 record prior to Michigan
State’s meet with Oklahoma last
Saturday night. He was thirdin
theiBig Ten last year.

Sophomore 130-pounder Cecil
Holmes should give Mike‘ Johnson
a far tougher "match than he has
had the past two weeks. Holmes,
one of the ﬁve Spartan starters
who hail from Oklahoma, won his
ﬁrst four matches this season.

Gary Smith, another sopho-
more, owns a 2-1-1 record and
is good enough tohave beaten-

_ tout Okla Johnson, . a Big Ten

champion and a. NCAA third-
place ﬁnisher, for the 123-pound
spot. Smith should prove trou-
blesome for the Panther’s Tom
Heniff.

Other,Spartans who should give’

not be determined until later in
the week when the ﬁnal challenge
matches are held.

The most likely chance for a '

. change in the lineup are in the
137 and’ 147-pound class. Bill
Solominsky will be challenged
by Don Caslow at 137-pounds—
and Frank O’Korn will defend
his spot against Tom Baily at
147—pounds.

Caslow gave Solominsky a tough
match last week and if Baily d1S—
plays the form he showed in win-
ning against Iowa State he could
displace O’Korn. The challengers
jobs are made difficult, however,
because they have to beat the in-

rather easily in practice.

Ware Impressive
Still, Ware’s impressive show-
ing against Army’s Bob Coulson,
who beat Roger Wikander of
Maryland_, who holds a win over
Barr, could influence Peery’s de-
cision. . ‘
Peery is hoping that sopho-
mores Heniﬁ and O’Korn can
continue the winning styles they
displayed against Army when
each scored his initial college
win. ‘
Prior to the Army meet, the
Panthers had won only four of
16 matches in the’ ﬁrst four weight

classes, with Mike Johnson,cop-

ping three of them. This is in far
contrast to recent teams when a
loss in the ﬁrst four weights was
a rare occurance.

More wins from the lower
weights, to go along with the ﬁne
performances shown by Johnson,
John Carr and Jim Harrison and
the improving Lee Hall and Barr;
could give Peery the well-balanc-
ed attack that denoted last year’s

team and make the wrestlers one-

of the favorites for Eastern hon-
ors. '

Hosts Gymnasts

' By AL BLUMKIN

The Temple Owls, sport-
ing a 4-1 record, will play
host to the Panther gymnasts
Saturday at Philadelphia. The
Owls have listed Springﬁeld
and Navy amongtheir Vic-
tims.

Temple is paced by Mark Cohn,
a sophomore who excels in three
events. “He just might win in the
side horse, horizontal bar and
parallels,” said Panther Coach
Warren Neiger. Cohn just missed
a perfect score of 100 in the side
horse against Penn State with a
score of 95.5.

The Owls also have Tim Phil-
lips, son of Navy Coach Chet
Phillips, who works the horizontal
bar, Bill Wright, an excellentlong
horseman, Barry Weissman, a star
on the still rings, and Ed Cumis-
key, a solid side horse man.

Sport 0-3 Record

' The Panthers, meanwhile, will
still be looking for their ﬁrst vic-
tory. The team has an 0-3 record,
105mg '60 Syracuse, Springﬁeld
and Army. '

Improvement is expected from
"Captain Ed Zamecnik, who had
a ﬁfth on the horizontal bar
against Army, and Bob Pinga-
tore, who has not lived up to
last year’s promise in the long
horse.

The Panthers will still be
troubled by ‘ deficiencies in the

“It Goes On..."

 

JUST CONCERNED

Basketball coach Bob Timmons has an inner motive for
his exemplary placid demeanor on the court-side bench. He
has long been involved in the game as. though he were J.
Paul Getty holding a pair of deuces in a penny—ante poker
game. ‘

For. the past twenty-five years Timmons has been
secretly harboring an ulcer in his body.

. “You learn to live with it,” says Timmons. “I have to
worry more about my diet than I do basketball. My doctor
told me to quit coaching or to quit worrying. So I quit
worrying. I let the boys worry. I have concern.”

Timmons is more than just concerned about this Satur-

V day’s test with arch-rival West Virginia at Fitzgerald Field

House- He’s been cream-coating his ulcer. “It warns me when
it’s acting up,” he explains.
Prefers Duquesne Win .

“Living in the same city with Duquesne,” he noted, “you
like to beat them. But if we didn’t play them, I’d want to
beat West Virginia and Penn State the most. But the people
you have to live with remind you of it a little more often
than the people who live 60 or 70 miles away. .

“It would help our prestige,” admitted Timmons,
whose team is dismayed because they have drawn no at-
tention nationally with their ﬁne 12-3 win mark.

The Panthers’ plan to use the Mountaineers as stepping
stones to ranking,‘ however, has been badly shaken by the

two consecutive losses of the visitors to Duke and Furman.

“We’d like to beat West Virginia,” Timmons said.
“We haven’t beaten them since 1955 down there. We’ve
had some close ones but someone always comes through
with some clutch baskets—like (Jerry) West and (Lee)
Patrone-—for them.” .

Saturday’s clash has been a sellout for a week, the ﬁrst
time all the ducats have disappeared since the halcyon days
of All-America West three years ago. The rush to the window
came this year because the status-seeking Panthers have a
chance. -

Figures He'll Be Underdog

“We’ve gone up against them before when we thought
We were going to win,” Timmons conceded. “I think West
Virginia will be favored by four or ﬁve points in our game.

“We want to blow them up as big as possible,” Tim-
mons says of ‘West Virginia. “Let them get overconﬁdent.
I’d like to see them come up here real complacent. But
that’s hard to do. They get up more for Pitt than they do
for their conference games.”

Can we beat West Virginia. “I don’t know,” replied Tim-
mons. “It would take an all-out effort on everyone’s part to
do it.”

I Timmons was queried about his reluctance to put the
Panthers on a game par with the Mountaineers. This
may have agitated his dormant ulcer a bit.

They’ve got good material and a good bench,” Timmons
opined. “They have a different philosophy. No one_’s ever in-
eligible down there. It’s a basketball school and they make no
bones about it.

“What’s (Rod) Thorn doing now?” exclaimed Timmons.
“He Wanted to be a doctor, but they spend more time at
basketball. They just keep them in school. I told Thorn that.
He had one of the best high school transcripts I’ve ever seen
— just one ‘B’, But'he_’s there to play basketball.” And study

A look at the AP or _U.PI ‘weekly polls might, ﬁnd themjhidden somewhere between

Illustrated sees ﬁt to rank them '

third in the East.

West Virginia’, a team that will
come to the Field House this Sat-
urday night is currently 12-5 and
ranked eighth in the country. It
is doubtful that they will retain
this ranking after suffering a 111-
71 defeat to fourth-ranked Duke
and a follow-up loss to Furman
on Monday.

Played Ranked Teams

However, they got this ranking
because they played such teams as
Ohio State,_ Illinois, and Kentucky,
all away from Morgantown, where
they seldom lose.

The Mountaineers are the ﬁrst
nationally-ranked team that the
Panthers have faced ‘all season. V
None of. the remaining’ teams’
on the schedule _are nationally-
ranked either.

Thus it follows if‘ Coach Bob
Timmons and his team are hoping
for any national recognition, they
must win on Saturday night.

Long Time

The last time Pitt scored a win
over West Virginia was the last
game of the .1955-56 season. In
that contest, the Panthers rallied
from a 17 point deficit to win by
the same margin. -

The Mountaineers, coached by
George King, former guard for
the professional Syracuse Na-
tionals, are counting heavily on
All-American Ron Thorn to
break the all-time record be-
tween the two schools, 48-48.

Thorn is leading the team in
scoring, and is at or near the top
in almost every other category.
According to coach Bob Timmons,
“Ben Jinks, who has been our best
defensive player against the big
man, will probably cover Thorn.”

Thorn’s running mate at guard,

Jim McCormick, is second in team
scoring. His 13 point average is
ten points below Thorn’s.

The bulk of the rebounding is
done by 6-8 junior center Tom
Lowry and 6-5 junior forward
Dave Shuck. Gale Catlett, 6-4
senior forward holds the -other
