Appointment questioned

me By Diane Leﬂcowltz
t A ThePitt_ News f

After the recent appointment of
Dr. Thomas Detre as"senior vice
president of health ‘sciences, ques-
tions were raised a-bout the search
process for Pitt-faculty and adminis-

tration at Monday’s meeting of the-

Senate Council.

Professor’ Donald McBurney,
._chairman of the Senate Tenure and
Academic Freedom Committee,
complained to the search committee
for not interviewing the candidates
who -were considered for the posi-

tion, and for not allowing room for A

input by hispcommittee.

“The Tenure and Academic Free-
dom " Committee wanted to have
some input into the selection pro-

cess,” Mc-Barney said. “Specifically,
we wanted to have theicandidates’
attitudes on tenure to be made a con-
sideration. for the search, process.
The fact that there were no inter-
views conducted made this impossi-
ble,-” he explained. - ’ .

“It’s hard for me to understand
how a bonaﬁde search process could
be conducted without ~candidates
being interviewed,” McBurney said.

Although required interviewing
of candidates is not part of the pres-
ent procedure, a new search proce-
dure being proposed before the
Senate Council will require the
search committee to interview can-
didates applying for a faculty or
administration position.

The question was also raised that,
when looking for a successor to cur-
rent Senior Vice President of Health
Sciences Nathan Stark, who has

held that position for 10 years, the
committee concentrated on P-itt

"faculty (of which Detre is a member)
rather than the national scope.

According to Pitt President Wes-
ley Posvar, however, two-thirds'to
three-fourths of all appointments
come’ from outside the university.

“Our search process, generally
speaking, works in every way that it
feasibly can to find the best person,”
Posvar said. “The objective task of
the search committee was to confirm
to themselves and to me that there
simply wasn’t anyone out there with

bettervcredentials.”

Posvar said the search is based on
merit and takes affirmative action
into consideration. He said it
involves an extensive search of all
possible people for the position.

The "Pittsburgh Reagan-Bush re-
election’ headquarters held an elec-
tion eve celebration Monday night
in anticipation of “one of the great-‘
est victories the Republican party
has had in this century.” The guests

. of honor_were Kansas Republican

Senator Robert Dole and his wife,
Secretary of Transportation Eliza-
‘beth Dole.

“Twenty-four hours from now

' we’ll be near a big, big victory all

across the country,”spredicted Sena-
tor Dole. Elizabeth Dole also pre-
dicted a “resounding victory.”

The Doles made these predictions
to an enthusiastic. audience’ of
Reagan-Bush campaign volunteers. T
The event was timed to coincide with
the local television six o’ clock
newscasts. v

The Doles entered flanked by

‘Pennsylvania Republican Senator
Arlen. Specter and Pittsburgh’s
grande dame of Republican politics,
Elsie Hillman. The Doles were
brought through the throng of well-
ewishers as fast as possible and
escorted to a back room and the
waiting electronic media. As Specter_
and Hillman warmed up , the
audience, the Doles answered re-
porter’s questions. _

When asked whygneither Reagan
nor Bush had come to Pittsburgh to
campaign, Elizabeth Dole said that
she was not aware of that fact.

race condemned

books. He went on to saythat we
should be wary of Reagan’s sudden-
i'nterest to sit down and talk wi'th the
Russians because he could be doing

this for re-election purposes. _
Dr. Wiest, a 'self proclaimed ‘
_ nuclear pacifist, is against, nuclear’

war but said that liberation in‘ some
countries can't be achieved without

conflict. “Reagan is so paranoid ~

with Russia that he thinks they are
the cause for all the problems we are
having in Latin America,” Wiest
said. . a

He also said that Reagan thinks
that countries would see things the
United States’ wayiif it weren't for
Soviet propaganda. He said that
dominant power, according to Rea-
gan,- is okay for the U.S. because we
know how to use it for the good of
the world and Russia doesn’t. -

“The deficit can be our. biggest
help in controlling the arms race,"
Dr. Weist said.n“The only place we
can get available money is from the

military because’ people won't stand ‘
in . social '

for any more cuts
programs.”

Dolepredicts win

When it was suggested that
neither the president nor vice presi-
dent had visited Pittsburgh in order
to_avoid the kind ofadverse public-
ity that Vice President Bush had
experienced in New Castle last Sat-
urday when he was confronted by
angry union workers, they refused to
speculate. “He [the President] can’t
be everywhere,” said Elizabeth
Dole.

“They haven’t been to Kansas‘

even once," said the senator. Since‘
the Republican Convention this

summer there has been much specu- V
-lation over the possibility of the
Dole—Dole presidential ticket in

l988. The Doles would neither con-
firm nor deny‘ any presidential
aspirations. "

“I don’t know about that,” said
the secretary of transportation. ‘‘I’m

enjoying the challenge of my present _

job." -

“l'm'going to help Elizabeth,"said_
the senator when asked if he would
resume hispresidential ambition in
four years. “I'll be up here a lot in‘88
carrying Elizabeth’s luggage," he
said. ' .

But
about Tuesday's election, the sena-
tor was happy to oblige. “I think[the
election] will be a wash,”-he said. “If
I was a Democrat, I'd be paralyzed.”

Dole said Mondale made two mis- .

takes in his campaign. The first was
a failure to take advantage of the
momentum he gained after the first
debate. The second mistake he said,
was to promise to raise taxes. He

Morita became interested in the
marketing side of the _business. He ‘
quickly adopted the idea that com-
munication is very important in
marketing. He felt it was necessary
to educate customers in how to use
technology to benefit their lives. He
also thought the company should

decided that the name » must be
changed. “Sony” was. arrived at by
searching through dictionaries. The
“s" ‘was chosen for sound,-which is
what their products dealt with. The
rest of the name was chosen from the
word “sonny” when they found that
it meant cute young boy; since they
were young men, they found this ‘
very appropriate. The second “n”

reasons for the dominance of Japa-

consumer buys Japanese products
and the dollar is much stronger than

emphasizing that Americans and
Japanese should work together to
solve problems, not to throw accusa-

Office of I

By Kate Piatek
The Pitt News

This fall, a wave of 385 new for- .

eign students flooded the Office of
International Services on the sev-
enth floor of the student union in
search of advice on settling into the
American culture. There, they found
friendly faces and ears eager to listen
to what was often broken English.

The big problems of adjusting and
the smaller onesof registration and
getting an ID are given an equal
amount of attention. There, they
know what kind of a stumbling
existence a foreigner is apt to lead in
a new country. For example, Geof-
frey Wood, the director of the inter-
national services, has spent a_ few
years in Greece and was very sur-
prised to find out one hungry after-
noon that the stores closed at 4 p. in.
So that the students can'avoid sim-
ilar surprises, Wood encouraged the
publication of “international Stu-
dent Handbook,” «which among
other things gives conversions of
temperature, weight-and monetary
systems. i

Of course, even conversion fac-
tors for temperature are not_ going to
help those faced with a dull crystal

layer on the windshield on their first
winter morning. Some might try, as
a native of Saudi Arabia, Khalid
Alhamid, a junior chemical engi-
neer, to pour hot water over it. They
are apt to find out to their surprise
that it didn’t do much good because
even though the layer was gone, so
was the windshield.

However, tips on monetary sys-
tems are useful, Wood observed:

“The U.S. is one of thefew countries

thafmakes paper money the same
color and the same size. Coins don't
say 25 cents, but a quarter dollar, or
a dime, or a penny. What is ‘a dime;
how much is that?” ' 4
The office starts cooperating with
foreign applicants long before they
actually arrive in Pittsburgh. Once
the foreign governments or individ-
uals from other countries file appli-
cations to the departments here at

’ Pitt, the offices‘ staff reviews them

for “evaluation of foreign creden-
tials." Accepted students then
receive -a pre-arrival sheet that tells
them how to arrive in Oakland from
the airport and where to check in for
the first night. ' '

Once here, they meet the foreign ,

student advisors Rhea Boudaoud or

Martha Ceiesiclki for five days of-

orientation. During that time, they
take a bus tour of Pittsburgh, go to a
baseball gameand cruise the three
rivers on the Gateway Clipper. Also

The Pitt News. weanegaay, November-7*," 1984

nternational Servicze

provided is information on how to
register, how to open a bank
account, immigration regulations
and issues around things unique to
the U.S._ like health care, which is
difficult to understand, said Bou-
daoud. For example, students who
come from countries where medical
services are free can‘t understand the
“exorbitant costs.”

In general, the purpose of the pro-
gram, according to Wood, is to get
the newcomers to become independ-
ent. “It's like being a parent,” he
admitted. Yet to him, foreign stu-
dents are extraordinarily brave peo-
ple and tend to be ac_ademica_lly
exceptional. He said that most of
them speak two or more languages,
yet American students" hating a per-
son making a mistake will assume
that he is not too smart.

Wood. said that American stu-
dents think of foreigners as“pushy."
To explain why foreigners behave in
a different manner, he recalls that in

Greece, one must “take a fork and.

bang on a glass” to summon the
waiters. In the store, if one doesn't
knock loudly on the counter, one is
apt to stand there all day and the
clerks won't" acknowledge him. To
Wood, “there are different ways of
doing things, one isn't better than
the other." .
This brings up an important prob-
lem with the program. According to

Rhea it lacks the intermixing of the
foreigners with Americans that
would provide a way to find out
more about each other and clear up
misunderstandings. -To fill this gap,
a “community outreach” program
that involves foreign students visit-
ing area high schools and church
groups has been operating in recent
years. “It provides a whole new per-
spective [for the foreign students],"
Rhea said. . .

Another such program allows for-
eign students to visit nursing homes
and become aware of the difference
in caring for the old. “It is shocking
for them. They couldn't believe that
we ship older people away [to the
nursing homes]," Rhea said.

On the Pitt campus, the interna-
tional day celebration serves the
purpose of cultures meeting half-
way. Folk dances and songs, nation-
ality food and items characteristic of
other nations are displayed by dif-
ferent groups from around the Pitts-

burgh area. Rhea would like to see.

this festival as the means for bring-
ing about peace in the world: “An
idealistic peace by token of living
side by side,” she said.

Working for the Office of Interna-

tional Services is an experience in

itself. Rhea said: ‘‘It’s an upbeat kind
of thing. [I] go home happy. lt’s not
all problem solving. [You] can‘t get

bogged down asin counseling.”

..ﬁ...   help,

As for the foreign students, little is
known about how the office really
helps them out. According to Maria-
Luisa Abugattas, a native of Peru

who has beenin the U.S. since late '

August, ‘ the orientation session
explained everything about the uni-
versity, but she only met other for-

eigners during it. Although she now.

has some American friends, deeper
friendships are hard to establish
because, as she said, “We are really
different.” This gain points to the

problem of little possibilities to meet,

American students, especially those

that are interested in foreign cultures b

and might be interested in forming

‘longer-lasting friendships, those

that will not mind little mistakes and
those that are tolerant to different
habits. - _

Strangely, the evaluations that the
office hands out to the foreign stu-
dents bring dubious results. They all
say that everything that the office is
doing is great. This provides no feed-
back and no way for the office to
know what it is doing well and what
it needs to work on more. According
to Rhea, foreign students might be
afraid to offend anyone. Unfortu-
nately, this way they only hurt them-
selves and those to come in the
future, for the office does not know
where it should improve and in what
directions to take the program in the’
future. . ‘

  America’s
Strength  

The election is over now and all we can do is wait. Who won
is, of course, important, but it is not the ﬁnal word "on Ameri-
can politics for the next four, or even the next two years. The
American people must remember that America is not syn-
onymous with l,600 Pennsylvania Avenue. America is nothing
less than the American people; it is New York businessmen,
Dakota farmers, Pittsburgh industrial workers, and western oil
men. It is white collar and blue collar. It is black,.white, Asian

- and Hispanic. It is, in short, a collection of individuals, as‘
‘various as pebbles on the strand, all united by a common

purpose; living togetlfer.

The American people cannot afford to lose sight of the fact
that they are not governed by a president or a Congress.
America is governed by every one of its citizens, all of the time.

< The government did not expand America from sea to shining
_. sea. _The government did not keep America free. The govern-

, Lment does not cure the sick and feed the hungry. The govern-

  

 choice will eventually,

ment does not educate. All that has been done —- good and bad

. — has been done by the will of the American people, translated

by them, into action.

Two Party
  System

What has happened to the “democratic” election process?
We are deceiving ourselves by continuing to believe that we still '
live and work in a democratic, pluralistic society. Two factors
of this year's election serve as disturbing indications of an
undemocratic shift in our electoral process. .

First, we are caught in a power struggle between two political
parties. Even though there are candidates from several parties
on the ballot, the presidential election has become extremely
polarized. This has severely‘ limited voters‘ alternatives by
creating an “either-or”, “win-lose" situation. Citizens who wish

. to vote for a third party, such as the Libertarian or Communist
party, find that their vote loses meaning in the emergent bipo-
larity of issues. i A

Not. only has the election been extremely polarized, but so
have political opinions. Democrats have become “leftists” and
Republicans “right-wing extremists.“ The words “liberal” and
“conservative" have taken on new meaning in this election...

Americans are becoming frighteningly predictable in their pol- ,' 

itical* choices. This phenomenon offers bright prospects for
campaign advertising but a dismal future for a scrutinizing an
independent electorate. ' , ' _

So what became, of pluralism? It seemed _to_' have started
disappearing simultaneously with social responsibility as citi-
zens increasingly placed their faith in unknown officials to
represent their interests. '

This leads to the second disturbing characteristic emergent
of voter behavior, and that is the displacement of responsibility
from the citizen to the bureaucrat. Far too many voters in_this
election were heard commentingon its “inevitable“ outcome.

. Are we returning to an era of “Devine Right" mentality? What

a frightening idea! It is disgraceful for any registered voter to _
give up his or her vote because “so and so will win anyway", or‘,

worse yet, tossacrifice the success of a certain ticket by writing.
in nominations that have absolutely no chance of winning.
We've drawn a vicious circle around our onceauthentic
electoral system: We allow campaign organizers to guide the
formation of our political‘ opinions only to submit to a bipolar

election in which the exercise of free choice becomes disadvan-
‘ tageous. -We need to recognize, now, that the creation of such a p
} situation andits subsequent side effects on the exercise of free _
lead ‘top the 'end of , democratic

  Letters to the Editor ,

HeartTransp1ant ot  Moral Issue

Many people have been talking
and writing emotionally about the
use of a baboon in the Baby»Fae
case. It is important to keep in mind
that the loudest voices we hear, from

the animalrights‘ people on TV to _

the newspaper editor, are only writ-

' ing about their own beliefs. Yester-

day’s Press editorial is a ,good

example. No one on the editorial

staff works in animal research or in

an. operating room, yet they write '

that the “paramount”_ question is
which is more important; a human
oran animal? Dr. Tom Starzl is
absolutely right; there is no moral
issue to speak "of in the death of an
animal to help a human.

Many people try to make it seem
like a very theoretical, religious‘
question. The Press writes that
theologians and philosophers

should be left to "debate it. It is the —

easiest thing in the world to argue
for the life of a baby over the life of
an animal. That, however, is ridicu-
lous. The animal activists and press
people who try to minimize the con-
flict to that simple black-and-white
question are doing great harm to the
millions of animals suffering need-
lessly around the globe.

In nature, animals have been pre-
dators and humans hunters since

-society began. The operation is not

some religious question of the super-
iority of man, or of animals’ destiny
to serve man, but only of a hunter
providing for the life of its offspring.

’ One more animal died, yet every day
. thousands of baby calves'are taken

from their _ mothers and milk-
fattened in small, dark compart-
ments. The press does not_ debate
this. V

One look in a supermarket
reminds us how many millions of
animals are killed for food every
day. We know, however,‘ that»hunt-
ing and providing for our children is
a natural thing. Even though I try to
be a vegetz tan, and live without
meat, I reali sthat there is nothing
wrong with tne hunters‘ beliefs in
eating animals. That doesn't mean,
though, that I should not be con-
cerned" about the inhumane over-
crowding of 'the ‘nation's steer
ranches. Similarly, I understand
perfectly the use of one more animal:

.that baby baboon never suffered a
day and its death saved the life of a?-

baby with a congenital heart defect.
This is an easy question when only a
simple and relatively humane death
is ' involved. Our beliefs about the
humane killing of animals have vir-

_  nothing_.to...do with the real

from a just and compassionate con-
cern for the suffering and anguish

When thousands ‘of dogs are

killed daily in our pounds nation- -

wide (and,.All_egImeny County has a
particularly inhumane way of killing

into a human. They never fed _the

baby carcinogens or toxins, never_

induced any diseases or injuries.
And although primate mothers go
through severe anguish and depres-
sion with the loss of babies, Loma
Lindaﬂospital has nothing in com-
mon with animal research in the real
world. I

It is‘terribly difficult for me to
separate my personal feelings about
animal experimentation, but I know
we must be realists. We name our
pets, but each_ one of the millions of

unnamed animals that suffer every "

day is a feeling, living creature. Their
hearts beat, they arewarm to the
touch and they can feel terror and
pain just as. any human can. ;We
know many animals are going to
sufferin experimental surgery, with

cancer, and burn with pain of chemi-_

cals and medicines right here at Pitt
every day. We know that research
will goon. The horrible crime is
when the people whose money is at
stake use the shrill, emotional argu-
ments like the Baby Fae case to

make any concern over the animals‘
pain seem irrational and dangerous.
Hiding behind sick children is at

, once the easiest and most cowardly

argument the grantees have, and
where sick children are involved, the
American public pours out all of its
compassion.  ; ,

Every year in Pittsburgh, as in
other cities,’ people give millions of
dollars during telethons for child-
rens’ hospitals,- but how many peo-

ple ever give a penny for the sick A

adults at. Presbyterian-University
Hospital? We give and give without
really asking where it goes because

of our love for, children. But the ’

researchers use that love to avoid the
costly and time-consuming process
of answering to. theirs and the pub-
lic’s conscience. It isalmost impossi-
ble_to g'et"through the mountain of
injections and bleedings ifyouthink
of them as animals, and not labora-
tory mice. When we eat meat, we put
the fact that this was once a warm,
living creature out of our minds, and
sadly, the people who do research do

the same thing: They put theisuffer- '

ing they are causing “out of their

' minds” because that is the only way '

they can get through their hundreds

’ of tests that they must do with only a

few animal,workers in the shortest
time. ' . 4

This is the real nightmare: The
researchers refuse to make the
changes to treat theiranimals like
sentient living beings, and they save
themselves this money by hiding.

.bchind images of sick children and

calling all people who care about

‘ animals “ﬂakes.“ We may not think
ourselves enlightened just because

we have made a hard decision con-
demning dogs and cats to suffer and
die, and then close our eyes to the
pain that we caused just because it is '
more time-consuming, more costly,‘

Heart Transplant Not A Moral Issue

and more draining psychologically
to look at them as individual ani-
mals. This would mean reapportion—
ing ﬁxed research budgets. It would
clearly mean establishing more
person-hours for the care of each
animal, and this would cost quantity
and the quality of the care given. The
expense lost, as in the deaths of the
200 rats at Salk Hall, was not in the
price of the animals, but in the
months of work lost with them.
Increased care and attention would
mean bigger ‘spaces for dogs and
cats, more human interaction and a
clear benefit in the better condition
and awareness of each laboratory
animal.

Make no mistake, this would not
mean any less pain to the animals
here, from th/e many related liver
transplant studies to the cancer and
diabetes animals, but we would be
relieving some of the fear and suffer-
ing of these animals, many of which

cause them, as we would accept the
pain of an animal outside of
research. This is why we have the
nearly military setup of production-
line testing and bleeding, to enable
us to get through the pain. Human
psychology allows us to dehumanize
our feelings to deal with the pain,
because we are “just doing ourjob,"
because every one does research that
way. ‘

Great people like Starzl and Salk,
real authority figures, have told us it
is all right to stack the animals into
their cages and, like the people in the
famous obedience experiment, we
can cause’ more pain than we ever
would normally because the author-
ity said it was all right. It has become
an unquestionable operation and
one day when we wake up, it will be

like My Lai all over again; we will

wonder how we ever let that go ‘on
for so long. Taking a baboon’s heart
or killing a cow for food has nothing
to do with the way animals become
dirt once the research starts, with

New program devised
to collect cans for charity

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

Don’t put that empty Coke can in
the trash! Walk yourself to one of
those big blue barrels that have been
sprouting up all over campus, and
make a contribution to Children’s
Hospital. The new drive is part of an
independent project on the Pitt and
CMU campuses, to use the junk-
drink addiction of university stu-
dents to a charitable advantage.

Last week, Joseph Bernot
received authorization from Harlan
Lavin, housing administrator at
Pitt, to set up barrels for his private
recycling corporation in dormitor-
ies, lobbies and hallways throughout
the university. Bernot’s company,
Morgan's Can Recycling, is fairly
new, and is designed speciﬁcally for
large fund-raising projects. Bernot
expects the project to create a firm
starting ground for his company,
but he adds that for every pound of
aluminum cans collected, 10 cents

will be donated to Children’s
Hospital.

Bernot expects success at the uni-
versities, despite the novelty of such
a large project. “I don’t know that
it’s really been tried before," said
Bernot. “Early indications are that it
will be a success.” He added that he
eventually expects to place more
than I00 barrels on the Pitt campus
alone. In the first two days at Pitt, an
installation of only 30 barrels in the
Towers dormitories and the Schen-
Iey Quadrangle managed to collect
over I50 cans.

The recycling drive has not made
a profit yet, according to Bergman‘.
The major hurdle he must jump is
the preliminary expense of cleaning
and painting the barrels. The Press
Old Newsboys Fund, an organiza-
tion dedicated to Bernot’s type of
charity drive, is helping guarantee its
success through’ their funding. Ber-
not stated also that university
authorization for his large project
makes it the only valid recycling pro-
ject on campus. He claimed that bins
placed by independent recyclers, like
the one located on the ground floor

of Thackeray Hall have no authori-
zation and that they should be
removed.

Probably the biggest concern for
both Children’s Hospital and Mor-
gan’s recycling, though, is the
response of students and faculty
toward these bins. “We have to
depend on the students, it'll take a
while to break old habits," said Ber-
not, referring to the need to change
the student tendency to carelessly
discard valuable aluminum cans. He
is attempting to place the bins stra-
tegically in areas that will be conven-
ient and obvious to the university
community. Predicting a Pitt stu-

dent has proved to be rough for Ber-.

not. “A vending location is a good
place to start, but not necessarily to
keep the barrels,” he said. The bar-
rels may be moved periodically to
test more strategic locations.

Bernot is serious about the pro-
ject, and he wants students to be
serious about it, too. “After all,” he
stated, “it’s better to contribute to
Children’s Hospital than to throw
the can away.” ' F

The Pitt News

In order to keep up with the ever
increasing demand in various tech-
nological ﬁelds, Pitt dedicated its
new Surface Science Center on
Monday.

The center, called by Mellon pro-
fessor and center director John T.
Yates, “One of the leading surface
science centers in th'e world,” will
delve into the fields of chemistry,
physics and engineering.

Surface science is concerned with
knowledge about the surfaces of dif-
ferent solids. A surface is the outer
layer of an object. These are very
thin, measured, at less than one-

millionth of an inch in thickness_.H_

Science center opens

’ This is roughly a thickness of 10

atoms or so.
The benefits from this type of

' research are DUIIICIOUS. SOIIIC exam-

ples are: Electronics — aids greatly
in the manufacturing of complex
electronic chips; Biomedical — sur-

‘face science aids in contact lens

manufacturing and also with pace-
maker. technology. _
Consumers may also benefit from

surface science research. Much work
is being done regarding plastics.
Binding plastics to surfaces can
sometimes be a problem, such as
with any cooking appliance with a

Teﬂon coating or the bumper of a -

car.
Numerous corporations and

foundations made the center a real-

ity with their generous donations.

 

1984

Gulf Oil was the leader with a
$500,000 gift. In return, the Gulf
Surface Instrumentation Labora-
tory will be the focal point of the
center. James E. Lee, chairman of
the board of Gulf Corporation,
commented that Gulf is “delighted
to see the center located at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, adding to the
growing technological expertise
available in this area." «

Others who gave financial sup-
port for the center’s development
were the R.K. Mellon Foundation,
the Office of Naval Research,
Dupont Inc., the Air Force Office of
Scientific Research, the National
Science Foundation, the Depart-
ment of Energy and the U.S. Army
Research Office.

“Mondale made a tactical error,”
the senator told his audience, “which
he'll have a long time to reflect on."

Dole further criticized Mondale
for suggesting that Reagan would
cut Social Security in a second
administration. He accused Mon-
dale of frightening senior citizens-.“I
was on the Social Security Commit-
tee,” said Dole and he assured the
audience that there is-“no need to
reduce Social Security.”

Elizabeth Dole preferred to
expound upon Reagan’s record,
rather than criticize the opposition.

“For three and a half years I've been *
at the President’s elbow,” said Mrs.
Dole. “I observed him, at times of

crisis,” she, said, “and I'm in awe of ‘

his strength and ability to lead with
grace and hur_nor.”

Secretary Dole also praised the
president’s record in regard to
women. She cited Reagan’s appoint-
ment of Sandra Day O'Connor to ,
the Supreme Court, Jeane Kirkpa-
trick’s appointment to the United’
Nations, his appointment of three

than at any time in history.” She
accused the Democrats of not know-

movement against hazing

(USPS) — These are good times
for college fraternities. After two
decades of decline, membership in
fraternities has gone way up. But as
more and more students have
joined, the hazing of new pledges has
become a serious problem.

Hazing may seem like harmless
fun, but it can often cause physical

harm. mental distress. discomfort‘

and embarrassment. And it can
sometimes lead to death. Common
causes of hazing deaths include alco-
hol poisoning, heart attack, suffoca-
tion and drowning. New state laws

I prohibit hazing, but dangerous'initi- M
I ation rites are still widespread.

“In the next few years, you're
going to see a larger number of
deaths from hazing," said Jack
Levin, sociology professor at North-
eastern University.

I Eileen Stevens is fighting to keep
this prediction from coming true.
After her son Chuck died in a hazing
incident five years ago, she founded
the Committee to Halt Useless Col-
lege Killings, called CHUCK, in
memory of her son and others who
met senseless deaths in fraternity
initiations.

Stevens’ son died pledging the
Klan Alpine fraternity at Alfred
University. During February in
upstate New York, he was locked in
a car trunk and told he could not
come out until he had consumed
huge amounts of whiskey, wine and
beer. He died several hours later of

‘acute alcohol poisoning and expo-
‘ sure to freezing temperatures.

Stevens was upset when the uni-
versity informed her that her son
had died from an “overdose of alco-
hol at a party," but she was outraged
when she discovered the truth about
the hazing incident. Later Stevens
learned “the college did not even dis-

cipline" the fraternity members
involved. She has campaigned
against hazing ever since.

When Stevens first started her
organization, only five States out-
lawed hazing. Today, l8’states have
laws banning hazing, and bills are
pending in eight other states.
Through her testimony at legislative
hearings and her anti-hazing lobby-
ing efforts, Stevens “has been
involved, either directly or indi-
rectly,” in having laws passed in 13
states. -

“These laws strengthen the hands
of college administrators,” Stevens
said. “Before, hazing was treated
with probation or a slap on the wrist.
Time and time again, the colleges
tried to keep incidents quiet. There
were very few repercussions. Now

hazing will involve severe criminal

penalties, as it should.”

Since founding her organization,
Stevens has lectured to students on
over 240 college campuses. Stevens
stresses her message is not anti-
fraternity, but anti-hazing.

“The fraternities have embraced
my work,” Stevens said. “It's very
gratifying to me that fraternities
have recognized that hazing is a
problem. There’s a great deal of
change going on, and a lot of posi-
tive action on the part of students
and the National lnterfraternity
Conference,” Stevens said.

The NIC, which represents 5,000
fraternity chapters on 650 campuses,
has opposed hazing since the organi-
zation was founded in 1909.

Although Stevens’ goal is to have
anti-hazing laws on the books in all
50 states, she says the laws will not
succeed in ending hazing without
student support.

‘‘I’m not going to change any-

thing, neither are the laws," Stevens
said. “The kids have to make the
changes themselves. There are vows
of secrecv and oaths of silence.
That's what has to change. The
greatest thing students can do to pre-
vent hazing is to educate each other
and bring such incidents, because 
too often, hazing incidents are found

out after the fact, and that’s sad.”"'i

Since 1978, 29 students have died
in hazing incidents. Experts expect
hazing to increase because of the 67
percent increase in fraternity mem-
bership on American campuses
since 1971.

On Aug. 30, 1984, hazing claimed
its latest victim. Texas A&M sopho-
more Bruce Dean Goodrich, 20,
died of heat stroke after three upper-
classmen roused him from his bed at
2:30.a.m., forced him to run around
campus, and finally do 87 sit-ups
and push-ups. Goodrich collapsed
shortly after and later. died. The
upperclassmen were members of
A&M7s Corps of Cadets and Good-
rich, a Webster, N.X,, transfer stu-
dent, was a cadet recruit. The
“motivatipnal exercises” Goodrich
endured are outlawed by the
university.

r

The threelcadets, as well as their '

unit commander, were indicted on

misdemeanor charges of criminally»

negligent homicide and hazing.
They were released on a personal

- recognizance bond in early October.

Two weeks ago, the three cadets
were suspended from A&M for the
remainderof the school year. -

“Hopefully, ‘the university, eve-
rybody will learn from this incident
and make sure that this thing never
happens again," said Bill Kibler,
assistant vice president for student
affairs. I’

W The United States government’s

, hunger for high technology is never

satisﬁed. Most» departments of the

U.S. government require research '

before proposed experiments or
trials can be executed.

Government agencies are not effi-
cient enough to conduct basic tests

‘on their own. Time and money

would be wasted on projects which
have already been researched

7 elsewhere. , -

The government recognizes ., its
inabilities and sells or contracts out
its need for technology to universi-
ties and colleges. A current media
blitz in Pittsburgh focuses on

Carnegie-Mellon University‘s bid _
.for such a contract. But little atten-

tion has been paidto Pit_t‘s involve-
ment with federal contracts.
According to Barbara L. Dip-
pold, assistant director of admis-
sions at the School of Engineering,
Pitt has been “involved with

; research-related federal - contracts

for'a number of years.-"
Prior to the Vietnam police

‘action, Pitt and other universities

were involved with government
research. Many were involved with

-“secret” or “classiﬁed” research,

according to Dippold. Student ac-
tivism at MIT forced administrators

The Pitt; News, Wednesday, ineiegebg; i7;i T984" R

Defense dept. uses research  

to drop their research on campus. -
Most colleges have followed suit.
“Most defense contracts with
government and other agencies were
dropped,”’said Dippold.
“Universities have contributed
major portions of research; they are
a major source of science and tech-
nological information,'.‘ said Dr._
Granger Morgan, department head
of engineering and public policy at
CMU, “not only in the fields of com-
puters but in dozens of other areas.
They [universities] have made
strong contributions to foreign and
domestic policy.” ‘
Public universities no longer per-
form the intricate part of testing, but
do research the parts leading to it.
According to Dr. Frederick Pet-
tit, chairman of metallurgical and
material engineering, “We do the
basic fundamental research. We [at
the university level] are so far away
from the product, there is no need to
classify the information. “Yet
government does not want its tech-

nology evaporated away.”

Pettit gave as an example the sil-
icon chip’s development and how
quickly the idea was stolen through-
out the world. Pettit cited his work
at Pratt & Whitney prior to teaching

at Pitt as similar to working for the '

government. . -
“Nothing worked on was really
classified, but we couldn‘t publish
material on research before it was
copyrighted,"he said.

work surrounds the development
and testing of metal alloys. His study
of thermodynamics will aid in turn-
ing out a barrier between the alloy
and the atmosphere that will allow
the most amount of stress possible of
that alloy. ,

Christine Young of Citizens‘
Forum on Nuclear Arms Control,
recently sponsored a talk at David
Lawrence Hall that dealt with the
question of the college's role in
national defense.

Young said, “The Citizens’ Forum
is not advocating a specific position
but introducing a panel that would

discuss ‘the problems of such~

research.” ’

In the talk, Dr. Morgan stated
that universities must be allowed
more parts of research. As Young
said, “Too much is being handled in
secret.” ‘

Although the group is supported
by other major anti-nuclear groups,
“Our statement is as general as pos-

sible onthe use of universities for

government research." .
Dr. Robert G. Colclaser, profes-
sor of electrical engineering at Pitt,
‘was selected for a project this past
summer. The Southeastern Center.

P of Education chose him out of 500

applicants to work on power-related
systems. _

According to Colclaser, “The con-
tract had [nothing to do with clas-
sifed. information but was more to
develop relations between institu-
tionsand government agencies.” _

Loitering

By Mike Nichol

The.Pitt -l_‘lews_ '

There is a- place for everything.

I One does not sleep in a concert hall,

or play football in. the middle of ‘
Forbes‘ Avenue. Roy Rogers Tuck

, Shop, located on the bottom floor of

the Cathedral, is also beginning to
recognize that there is a place for
-everythinggand-it is making the dis-
tinction between where one should
study and where one should eat.’

The location of the Tuck Shop
and itsafﬁliation with the university
has caused a slight dispute. Should
the students at Pitt be permitted to
use the restaurant as they might use
‘any other university building? The
answer IS yes and no, according to

' - John Miller, manager of the Cathe-

d'ral’s built-in eatery. - .
“During the heavy lunch hours,
_students sometimes try to use the
place as a study spot between
classes, and that sort of thing,” said
Miller. "He added, “We don't mind
this during the hours that the restau-
rant isn’t crowded, but we some-

~ times have 450 people in here at
. lunchtime, and can't deny seats to
.-‘paying customers because someone

_wants to study here.” The regular

I seating capacity for the Tuck Shop is

around 300.

Another problem for the_restau-
rant is that some students like to

bring bag lunches in and eat there.-
One student said, “Roy.Rogers is an ' '

ideal place to eat a bag lunch, espe-
cially when I have consecutive
classes in the Cathedral. 1 think we
[commuters] have as much right to

4 eat here as anyone else, since the
restaurant is inside a Pitt building.

7‘

The University does have a say in I

the operation of the Tuck Shop, and
makes a fair share of the profits,
according. to Miller.- But the

employees are left on their own to.

make a policy and stand by ‘it. And

' they have. -

Terry Milani, head of the Com-

rnuter Association, said that he has -

heard few major. complaints con-
cerning the Roy Rogers policy. “I
understand the Roy Rogers situa-
tion, but we have our own restaurant
here in the Student Union; that usu-
ally solves the problem-’ Milani says‘
that there are “ample amounts of

Pittsburgh’s North Shore Center

This was an innovation architectu-'

The Pitt-News, Wednesday, November 7 1984' “

;

However -much the public relations men and poli-
ticians try to cover Pittsburgh with the oily film of
Renaissance Two, that glittery mesh of corporate
eminence and architectural expansion, the gritty
industrial character of this city cannot be masked.
Towering abovethe sterileskyscrapers that clog

downtown is a primal and honest charm that is-'

uniquely Pit_tsburgh’s. 4

One place that embodiesthe true character of
Pittsburgh and betrays many of its’ paradoxes is
Panther Hollow, also known as simply, “the H01-
low.” Located in the bowels of Oakland, the Hollow
is a place few Pittsburghers see close up. It is a nether

world of weeds and railroad tracks, where the base

s

and industrial converge. _

The Ho11ow’s. rickety traintracks and dilapidated
train cars, perennial rn.etaphors for stagnant indus-
try and commerce, betray the growing city above.
Ironically, they lie in ‘the shadow of the"city’s two
major universities as well as the Carnegie Museum
and Library. This valley of rusted railroad spikes,
broken shoppingcarts and- otherjetsam from the

Them News, WednesdayNovember7.1984 ‘ a 13

urban world literally slices through the cultural and
geographical center of the city.

There is much beauty in and among the wasteand
ugliness that is the Hollow. Beyond its obvious
material decay, the Hollow, possesses a strong and
endearing ambience. From the tired frame houses on
Boundry Street to the pitch-black railroad tunnel at
the other end, it seems aloof and content to exist in
its own unspoiled decadence with no desires, frustra-
tions or pretensions. ' _ _ ,

I Conﬂicting signals emanate from the Hollow. It is
simultaneously a calm sanctuary from the world
i ‘above imbued with an unmistakeable spirituality,
and a‘ swollen gutter on waste and abandonment.
‘ N,gthing’,better comments on this than the giant,
clearly labeled replica of a human nerve, rendered in
.spray paint on the side of a marooned trash dumps-
ter. It sits in the middle of the Hollow, faintly visible ‘
from the Schenley Park Bridge above. ‘Beckoning?.
Warning? Perhaps just a poetic landmark for this
valley of lost nerves.

Winter sports get underway here at Pitt

Swimmers

The University of Pittsburgh
women’s swimming and divingteamg
opens up its regular season tomor-
row when the team travels to Kent '
State __for a dual meet. The Panthers
boast a veteran squad as they begin
their quest for their third consecu-
tive Big East championship.

Coach Dave Belowich’ described
himself as “excited” yes_terday as his
squad wound down preparations for
this weekend, which also features a

gan on Friday. Belowich is entering
his fourth year as women’s head
coach and is looking _for this season
to be his most prosperous. He com-
mented, “We pretty much have the
same team back as we had last year.
They were fun to work with last year
and they're fun this year. The times ‘
have been fast for both the sprinters
- and middle distance swimmers -in
practice. It's a matter of whether or ;
notthey can do it in the dual meets.’-’
Kent State is in the midst of build-
ing their program much the way Pitt
’ built -theirs in the last half decade.
Belowich expects Kent State to pro-
vide a challenge for his swimmers,
but is confident that his troops will
prevail. He explained, “Kent'State is
building a program and has shown
progress and improvement. They
have some really good swimmers.
Kent State will be a good tune-up for
us.” I . '
What is commonly thought of as a
rule of life states, “It never gets any »
easier.” It won't for Belowich,
because Friday he takes his women
up against a Michigan squad that
was ranked l0th in the nation last
year. Michigan will be looking for
revenge of the humiliation they
received at the hands of the Pitt
swimming and diving team last sea-
son. Belowich said about that meet,
“Against Michigan, we swam real
well and they had a bad day.” The
Panthers hope to be undefeated
when they return to host the Pitt
Invitational on the following wee-
kend. A repeat of last year’s opening
victories over Kent State and Michi-
gan will ‘fulfill that wish.

suffered a broken bone in her hand, ‘

' but Belowich is. confident she will

division 3 champ last year. The meet

begins at 3:30 p.m.

C alderone

all-around I

gymnast .

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

Kim Calderone is a name synony-
mous with high school gymnastic
championships in Pennsylvania and
is a name familiar to anybody who
has ever read the sports pages in the
south suburbs during gymnastics

 

season. You simply could not miss .

it. Kim Calderone.

Calderone is now a freshman at
Pitt, enrolling with credentials
impressive enough to make any Pitt
fan wonder just how good she could

get. As a junior at Baldwin High «

School she won both the WPIAL
all-around championship and was
crowned the PIAA champion. Last
year she finished second in the all-
around in the PIAA while taking
first in the beam event at the
competition. ' - -

The strong program and Pitt’s
proximity prompted Calderone to
come here." She said, “Well, for one
thing, it’s close toihome. My sister
goes here, too. I knew the coach and
I liked her a lot.‘ I knew she was a
very good coach and that Pitt had a
strong program academically as
well."

It was, at first, a case of sibling
rivalry that started Kim into the
strange world of uneven parallel
bars and balance beams. “It was my
sister who got me into it [.Iackie, also
a member of the Pitt team]. I was
about l0 years old, and it was what-
ever my sister did I had to do too.”
The younger Calderone also gives
credit to her sister for helping

smooth the way into college life.-

“She has been a big help to me. She
warned me about things like the
_workload, and , just showed me
around the place.”

But the work, Kim had to do on

. her own. “Right now, I practice

about three or four hours a day, and
in the summer I practice for five
hours a day,” said Calderone. I
Kim has noticed differences in the
transition from high school gymnas-
tics to college. “In high school, it was
much more individual. We played as

a team, but the individual _ was’
’ “ stressed heavily, in college it is much

more team oriented.” A lot is
expected of the team this year, and
Calderone shares that optimism. “I
think we'll be very good." Good
enough to win regionals, where the
Lady Panthers finished second last
year‘? “Well, I don't know,” she said,
hesitating for a moment, and then
added-, “Yeah, I think we can win
them”. ' _

“The Eastern Nationals are

benefit them. Plus, the tourna-

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

In these most arresting of times in
recent Pitt football history, few
eyebrows stand on end when debat-
ing the merits or demerits of an
offense. Nine games and seven losses
into this careening season, the
Panthers have 15 touchdowns,
barely 300 total yards per game and
have been decisively outscored in
every quarter. . _

Dawv’ H0Qke’/ The P1” News mind except his own, Foge Fazio
Chris Jelic’s (I6) alternation with John Congemi as quarterback is just one of the problems with the Pitt offense. increasingly runs out of days, [gt

 

alone games, to correct the terminal ’
ills besetting ya once-proud unit. This
week it’s Tulane at home. Time for
the seniors to relish their last home
game. On Thanksgiving weekend,
the Pitt-Penn State rivalry adds a
new chapter to the annals. But will it
really be a ball game?

That’s it. No bowl games this year,
just the thoughts of either trying
their hands at pro ball or ﬁdgeting
until next season for the players. For .'5.>-e
the coaches -— of those still guaran-
teed ajob in ’85 — two games and an
entire off-season await them to rea-
lign an offense caught in stagnation.

Can it be done? Sure, Fazio beams
from eyes surrounded by darkened
creases. As official visit time
approaches (Dec. 1) for those high
school recruits still \ couragious
enough to commit to Pitt, Fazio
« . already intends to haul in enough =4

— linemen to break the limit offensive
coordinator Joe ‘Moore strictly
imposes.- And, for the record, Fazio
talks about making pitches to find
the 11 fastest and 11 strongest blue
chippers possible.

Meantime, he went on record yes-

night alone, Fazio became disgusted
upon ﬁnding no leftovers in the

‘ fridge. ~ When wife Norma and ‘\_
daughter Kristen arrived later that
evening, he cussed them out.

Shelton Collier's advice has thus far been taken well by Pitt’s female spikers, who are 22-6.

The'Pitt News, Wednesday; ‘November 7,’ l'984'”

Penn State rivalry

motivates Pitt

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

So Pitt (22-6) has finally defeated
Penn State. The consequences of
that victory are deeply embedded in
the minds of the players and
coaches, but few others. It will not
make much difference, almost cer-
tainly, to those who tabulate
women's volleyball rankings, which
will be announced today.

Penn State will very likely drop,
and Pitt will very likely remain on
the perimeter of national notice.
Defeating the No. 7 team, which Pitt
did and Penn State was, is no stair-
way to immortality. It is a step in the
right direction, but there are some
very good reasons that the Spikers
will not see themselves on that envia-
ble list.

To begin with, the Lady Lions
defeated the former No.1 team, the
University of the Pacific, in addition
to upsetting a team that defeated
two» Top 10 teams. San Diego,
whom PSU dropped in three
straight games, had knocked off
Southern Caland UCLA.

Pitt, on the other hand, while

tackling some strong opposition and
having at least a fair shot at winning
the conference, has not knocked off
any powerhouses of late. Three
years ago, Pitt traveled to sunny
California and washed out Pepper-
dine and Cal-Berkley to pose a
threat to Western dominance; no
one else in the East has been able to,
according to Pitt head coach Shel-
ton Collier. Until now.

“That [defeating PS U] really gives
us national credibility,” said Collier.
“Are we as good as those teams?” he
asked rhetorically. “No way, but this
team nailed Penn State, and right
now, that's all that matters.”

Collier thinks the PSU win in this
weekend’s Pitt Classic holds a differ-
ent kind of significance from the
Pepperdine and Cal-Berkeley wins.
“This might have been more signifi-
cant because a whole lot of people
from this area saw it. Our players
really gained a lot ofrespect fortheir
efforts.”

Thus, the Pitt-Penn State rivalry
is no longerjust a regional thing; it’s
gone national. However,‘ a rivalry
spices an upset immeasurably.

Junior Sally Gillespie reminded
us of the basics: “It’s always a good

“Sit down and shut up and don't
be rude and interrupt,” said Homer.
“As I was saying; everything is going
just how they want it at Pitt. You
see, F‘oge wants to lose.” A

Now I was beginning to wonder if

old Homer- hadn't had"a few too‘

many “Greenies” when he started to
explain his logic to me. :
“You see, after you win for a few

years l_ike~Pitt has, people expect you
to win and when you win it isn't news‘

-because you were supposed to win
anyways, see. So to make the papers
and stuff, you have to do what peo-
ple don’t expect and lose. Not only
that, in the next year or two you
decide to start winning again and
you get ranked higher_in the polls
and win‘ all kinds of comeback-oil
the-year awards so Foge can collect
all those awards and get his picture
all over the newspaper.”- said
Homer, leaning back on his chair
looking very -proud with himself for
catching on to Foge’s game plan.

Now I was going to open my
mouth, another thing you shouldn’t
do in a Dew Drop Inn.

“Just one thing Homer,” I said.
“How is F oge going to win all those
awards if he gets fired?" _ -

As I picked myself up off the
ground outside the Dew Drop Inn
and checked for any major injuries, I
swore that I would never go'into

another one ever again because 1'

always get thrown out. If you ever
find yourself in a Dew Drop. Inn,
here are .a few things to remember;
Drink your beer out of the bottle,
nod a lot and never ever say aything
that would make Homer think that
you may be questioning his logic.

Penn State’s
rank no matter
to Pitt spikers

continued from page (went y
game, and we’re always geared up
mentally and emotionally,” she said.
“Any time Pitt defeats Penn State,
‘it's always a great win."
Penn State coach Russ Rose said
‘ that the rivalry has been too one-
sided of late in his team's favor. “It's
not good for one team to win all the
time,” Rose remarked. “At Penn
State, we haven‘t lost to Pitt in four
or ﬁve years.-Pitt’s win is good for
the rivalry.

“They had more to gain than we
did,” he continued, “and nothing to
lose. It was just a matter of time
before they won; the last three times
we walked off the court winners. We

expected them to play their best _

match, and they were much better
prepared to play than we were.”
Pitt outside hitter Pat Belcher
pointed out that Pitt is chronically
upset-minded.’ “We have three more
chances to knock -off [highly-
ranked] teams after this. This was
our best chance, being at home and
knowing Penn State the way we do.”
The Pitt players and staff main-
tain atlevel of non-chalarice that per-
mits them to face intimidating teams
with_out trepidation, and they are
able to trample less competitive
teams‘ within the Big East and within
the region. An instance of this was
the Southern Division tournament
held early in the season, at which
Pitt ran up 18 wins against no losses.
Occasionally, the spikers are caught
resting on their laurels, as the Pitt
Invitational three weekends ago.
However, the team was ready for
Penn State Saturday. Just ask any
spectator or player — like senior set-
ter Cathy Rupp. “We emphasized

playing hard and well and to go out
and have fun,” she said. “We just
didn't care -——- we cared about the
outcome of the game, but not that
they were ranked. We wanted it
more than they did. l think they were
scared of us because they know we
don’t care that they’re Penn State.
“Up until this weekend, they

_ deserved to be ranked seventh,"

Rupp said. “They've got excellent
hitters and a good setter, but we
have a lot of things that can rival
that. Our win hasquieted a few PSU
people down. It helps recruiting and
it shows that we can compete with
them — more than compete.”
Rupp said that the win, not sur-
prisingly, gives the team a boost of
confidence. “We had some questions
after the Providence loss, which may

have been the best thing for us. This

PSU win brings our conﬁdence level

back up, but not so high that we‘

don't work hard." ‘
“This match helps them men-
tally,” Rose agreed, adding that Pitt
has a good chance to win the Big
East. Penn State defeated Provi-
dence (33-3), whom Pitt will also

probably need to defeat in order to ~

win the Big East.

“If Pitt plays the way they did
tonight, they will be favored to win
the conference." Rose added that
records. do "not necessarily indicate
who has the better team. “Pitt has
played a better schedule, so it’s hard
to say. If I were a betting man, I’d
pick Pitt to win. Being in Pennsylva-
nia, l’m rooting for Pitt to win
[against Providence].” _

Pitt will be competing. in the
Louisville Classic this weekend and
at Eastern Kentucky on Sunday.
