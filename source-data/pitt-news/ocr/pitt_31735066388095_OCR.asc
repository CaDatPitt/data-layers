Bush callscease-fire

End of war conditional on withdrawal

By Jeff Tatusko

Perspective Editor

Iixactly 100 hours after
launching a massive ground
assault to drive the Iraqi army
from Kuwait, President George
Bush suspended all military
actions against Iraq.

Iiffective at midnight last night,
President Bush declared victory
over Saddam I Iussein, sayingthat
the coalition achieved all of its
obj'ecti\'es. Ile told the national
audience that “soon Ariierica will
be welcoming our troops home.”

“Kuwait has been liberated,"
he said. “lraq’s army has been

defeated."

But Bush also said that the
cease-fire was conditional. He
told the Iraqis that they would
not be fired upon as long as they
withdrew peacefully. I Ie said the
coalition forces would not fire
upon the Iraqis unless fired upon.

Bush gave several conditions
which Iraq must follow for the
ceasefire to remain permanent:

-Iraq must completely
withdraw from Kuwait.

0 Iraq must hand over all ofthe
Kuwaiti detainees which were
taken hours before Kuwait (Iity
was liberated.

IFC announces rush changes, adds committee

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Sta_[)" Writer

The Inter—Fraternity Council
added an amendment to include
a social-monitoring committee in
its by—laws and voted on proposed
rush dates at a meeting Tuesday
evening.

Under Article 1, Section M of
the bylaws, IFC representatives
added the social-monitoring
committee, which is to be under
thewjurisdiction of the IFC judicial
board and “is responsible for
monitoring rush, as well as social
functions,” according to the
amendment.

This committee, which will
include no more than one
member from each house, will

be randomly chosen each week
by the internal vice president to
monitor social functions.

After monitoring the social
functions, the committee
chairman will report his findings
to the chief justice of the IFC
judicial board. The chief justice
will then meet with the entire
judicial board to determine
whether any actions by the houses
were violations of the current
alcohol policy and whether or
not charges will be filed against
chapters.

Patrick Zubrow, rush chairman,
announced the proposed rush
dates for fall term 1991. Several
changes will occur with this rush.
The potential rushees will
participate in an instructional

seminar which explains the rush
process.

"At the seminar we’ll introduce
this [new plan} to the rushees and
explain that they should try to
see as many houses as possible
so that they can choose the best
fraternity for themselves. Since
we are dividing rush by the
geographic areas, it will make it
easier for the rushee to see as
many houses as possible,”
Zubrow said.

For rush, the fraternities have
been divided into three categories:
houses on the hill, houses in
North Oakland and other
fraternities. Each area will have a
specific night on which it will be
permitted to have a formal rush.
“What we have done as a

committee is to schedule events
by geographic regions. Basically
it will be an open house for every
chapter," Zubrow said. J

As part of this new policy, the
IFC will provide the houses with
food and beverages for its formal
rush night so that all houses will
appear more equal. “This allows
smaller houses not to have
competition from other houses,”
Andy Feldman, internal vice
president, said.

The proposed rush dates are
Aug. 27 through Sept. 9, although
no events are to be held between
Aug. 29 and Sept. 3 because of
the holiday weekend.

At the recent Northeastern Inter-
Fraternity Council conference,

PAT cuts would hurt commuter students

By Mike Ertl
Sta_0'W1-tier

Port Authority Transit officials said Gov.
Robert Casey’s proposed budget for 1992
could leave PAT with a revenue shortfall of
$38 million, which could leave many student
commuters on the short end of the stick.

According to PAT spokesperson Debra
Decourcy, many students who rely on public
transportation, especially those who ride in
the evenings, midday hours and weekends,
would be among those most affected by the

budget cuts. “They would be affected
because these are areas in which we would
more than likely have to eliminate service,”
said DeCourcy, PATs assistant manager for
media relations. “It really would be impacting
people that can least afford it (students) both
in terms of financially as well as having no
other option."

DeCourcy said it’s too early to be specific
about where the cutbacks would be made.
However, if the budget cuts were passed,
PAT would probably have to eliminate at
least 80 routes, she said.

“The only thing we could afford to run is
morning and evening rush hour," she said.

According to figures released by PAT the
governor's proposal will cut state aid from
$102.8 million in the current fiscal year to
approximately $82.4 million in fiscal year
1992.

Combined with a $9 million federal cut
proposed by the Bush Administration and $9
million in increased costs because of inﬂation,
this could create a deficit of as much as $38

million.

Gulf War steals attention from Lithuanian struggle

By Jean Lewis
For The Pitt News

While protesters around the
world marched for peace in the
Middle East, the Soviet Union
acted to halt Lithuania’s move
toward independence.

On Jan. 13, 1991, the presence
of Soviet troops was felt in
Lithuania when three people were
crushed to death, 14 died and
many others were injured in
response to Lithuania '5 declaration
of independence in March 1990.

Initially the Soviet Union
announced that it was sending to
Lithuania troops representing the
National Salvation Committee, an
organization comprised of
Lithuanians from the Lithuanian
Communist Party who did not
support the declaration.

However, since that time the
National Salvation Committee has
been banned and disorganized.

Vito Yucius, president of the
Lithuanian Citizens’ Society in
Pittsburgh, said that he was “very
excited” about Lithuania’s
declaration of independence.
After 91 percent of the Lithuanian
voting population voted in favor
of independence, Yucius said, “I
feel in my heart that some kind of
arrangement will have to happen.

john McCloskey, an American
with roots in Lithuania, said,
“While our backs were turned,
innocent people were attacked
using the old Communist trick:
[saying] that they were invited.”

While the world’s attention was

focused on the Middle East, the
Soviet attack commenced under
the shadow of the impending
deadline for Iraq to withdraw
forces from Kuwait.

Lithuanian—born Gintas Vilkelis,
a physics graduate student at the
University of Pittsburgh, said it is
interesting that during the
crackdown in Hungary in 1956,
the world’s attention was on the
Suez Canal. “They find convenient
moments when the world is
looking the other way.”

Jonathan Harris, associate
professor of political science, said
the Soviet Union has never fully
understood the aspirations of the
Baltic states.

Harris said that President
Mikhail Gorbachev believes that
“the unity of the U.S.S.R is essential
for lGorbachev’sl superpower
plan [to work].’' Harris said this
view is an unorthodox vision of
the future. The Soviet government
fears that if Lithuania secedes, it
will encourage other republics to
do the same, causing a domino
effect.

“I don’t see how they can
resolve the issue" as long as
Gorbachev retains the military
presence in Lithuania, said Harris.

However, Harris said, “It
doesn't look like Gorbachev will
declare presidential rule; he is
fearful of alienating Western
support.”

The events leading up to the
attack on Jan. 13 started as early
as 1988, when the popular fronts,
or grass—roots organizations,

began rallying for greater
economic autonomy in the three
Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania.

When their demands for reform
were ignored by the Soviet Union,
Lithuanians began to talk aloud
about independence. On Feb.
16, 1989, Lithuanian citizens cel-
ebrated their independence from
Russia for the first time since
1918. At that time, the republics
of the Soviet Union needed only
a two-thirds majority in their parl-
iament to declare independence.

A law was passed by the Soviet
parliament on March 2, 1990,
which stated that a Soviet republic
needed a two-thirds approving
parliamentary majority in each
republic in order to secede. If the
republic did not secede, then it
would have to wait another 10
years before it would be allowed
to have another vote placed
before the parliament.

Not long after, Soviet tanks
were sent to Lithuania to ensure
its political stability. Vilkelis said
that President Bush made a
mistake by not reacting to the
Soviet oppression; instead, he
gave his approval to Gorbachev.

In April the Soviets
implemented an economic
blockade in Lithuania, and all of
Lithuania’s borders were sealed.

It was not until July 1990 that
Lithuania declared a moratorium
and accepted the declaration of
March as long as the Soviet Union
started negotiating.

The Soviet Union did begin
negotiating in November but also
stipulated that Lithuania rejoin
the Soviet Union.

Since it did not meet the
demands outlined by the
negotiations, Lithuania was
invaded lastjanuary. One of the
many explanations given by the
Soviet Union for the attack was
that it was going in with the
intent to catch draft dodgers.

Vilkelis said he has three pieces
of information which indicate the
invasion was to destroy the
Lithuanian government.

°One of the persons killed on
Jan. 13 was from the seventh
section of the KGB, a top-security
division, and had been wearing a
bulletproof vest. “These agents
can only be activated by a
personal order from President
Gorbachev,” added Vilkelis.

-Vytautas Sakalaukas, former
Soviet ambassador to Mozam-
bique, was called back to Russia
just days before the crackdown
and was offered a seat as prime
minister of Lithuania when the
government was overthrown.
Sakalaukas declined the offer.

0A new delegate was sent to
Lithuania on the eve of the attack
so that he could take his seat as
the general secretary of the
Communist Party of Lithuania.

Vilkelis said there is still a strong
Soviet presence in the streets of
Lithuania after the January attack.

He added that Soviet soldiers
have been told that all Lithuanians
are killers and that they want to
kill Soviet soldiers. “Not that this
is a socialist county that they
have to defend," he said. “Many
Russian soldiers don’t even know
who [Boris] Yeltsin is."

Vilkelis said President
Gorbachev has not delivered his
Nobel Peace Prize speech in Oslo.
“I would like to hear what he has
to say about peace now," he said.

He said President Bush should
support the Lithuanian
government.

Yucius added that in all of the
references Bush made to the Baltic
states, he never once used the
word “independence.”

Yucius has a radio program,
called “Echoes of Lithuania,”
which airs every Sunday at 12:30
p.m. on WPIT, to help keep the
Pittsburgh community informed
about the events in that country.

Stu dents may access documents
published in Lithuania on UNIX
to keep up with new events.

Many people are concerned
with how the gulf war is affecting
children.

The Child Development and
Child Care Program in the School
of Social Work at Pitt is Oonduaing
surveys in public schools to find
out how the children are dealing
with the war, said child
psychologist CarlJohnson, Ph.D.

Johnson said sixth-graders have
been asked to draw pictures
showing what they think about
the war. A high percentage of
boys drew very graphic, detailed
pictures showing ‘Rambo-like

tru<:tion of Saddam Hussein."

However, Johnson said there are I

tremendous individual
differences in how children are
reacting, depending partly On
how their parents deal with the

situation and how vulnerable they
are to the situation.

Linda Stagon, director at
Edgewood Day Care and teacher
of the 2-and—a-half to 3—and-a-
half-year—old class, said that in
general she has not seen much of
a change in the children's
behavior since the war began.
However, one child's mother is
preparing to leave for the Middle
East, and he is having behavioral
problems, she said.

Beth Wilson, a teacher Of a 4-
to S-year-Old class at the day care
Oenter, said that the children talk
about the war among themselves
but do not ask many questions Or
talk with her about it. She also
said that they seem to have a
basic understanding of what is
going on but do not seem
understand how critical the war
is. She said that the children do
not act more aggressive from

hearing and watching information
about the war, and they rarely
even mention weapons when
they talk about the war.

Johnson said some children
are interested in the war, but do
not want to hear too much about
it because they want to be
protected from it. Some children,
Johnson said, feel that “it’s adult
stuff. I can't deal with it. It's over
my head.”

Since children are aware to a
point of the events taking place
in the Middle I-Iast, “not to talk
about it allows children to be
worried.”

The Division of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry at WPIC
has written a pamphlet entitled,
“The War and Your Child." The
pamphlet answers questions that
parents have about what to tell
their children and how to help
them cope with the situation.

unconditional, and they said that
the ground war would continue.

Saddam said Iraq had begun to
withdraw from the country, but
Bush and other military officials
disagreed. Schwarzkopf said, “A
withdrawal is an orderly
movement of troops without
being forced out. The Iraqis are
in a full-scale retreat."

Yesterday, Kuwait City was
liberated by American, Saudi and
Kuwaiti forces. The city
resounded with cheers from
citizens and the Kuwaiti troops.
The celebration followed a bloody
battle at the Kuwaiti International
Airport, where the U.S. lst
Armored Division destroyed an
Iraqi division.

During the 44-day conflict,
Iraq’s only weapon was the Scud
missile, a highly inaccurate
weapon which was fired at both
Israel and Saudi Arabia with little
success. The U.S. Patriot missile

normally destroyed the Scuds ‘

before hitting the ground.

Since Jan. 16, the beginning of
the massive air campaign, 78
American soldiers were killed in
combat and 213 were wounded.
This includes 28 who were killed
by an Iraqi Scud missile which
fell on a military barracks. At least
10 of those who died were with
the 14th Quartermasters, based
in Greensburg, Pa.

The Iraq army had been
suffering heavy losses since the

Over 50,000 Iraqi POW/s had been
taken, most of them since‘
Saturday. As many as 3,700 tanks
were destroyed as of yesterday's
battle inside Iraq, and nearly 2,200
artillery pieces were destroyed as
well.

Many questions will remain
after the shooting has stopped.
Many believe that Saddam will
have to give up power. Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said Saddam cannot stay in power
or Israel will be in danger. Others
in the Arab world agreed with
that assessment.

Schwarzkopf denied reports
that Saddam was the ultimate
target of the war. “There were no
Iraqi troops for 150 miles between
our troops and Baghdad,” he
said. “If we had wanted to destroy
Iraq, nothing could have stopped
us ”

Gay rights challenged. . again

Once again a gay person's right to protection against
discrimination has come under fire in the city of Pittsburgh.

Last week, a group called Citizens for Pittsburgh
handed a petition to the county Board of Elections with
11,572 signatures requesting a referendum on the city’s
recent gay-rights ordinance. This organization is seeking
to strip the power from the mayor or City Council to
designate gay men and women as a minority or protected
class.

The petition’s validity is now being challenged by
another group, called the Pittsburgh Fairness Campaign,
which maintains that 5,510 of signatures were from
people who weren’t registered to vote or who weren’t
residents of the city. ' P "A.

When the law was passed, a lot of controversy and
anger was directed towards the gay community in
Pittsburgh. Some of the ordinance’s foes maintained that
if there were a law to protect gays, it would promote
homosexuality and a corrupt lifestyle.

Eleven months later, there have only been seven
complaints registered, and none have been settled.
Whether the population of Pittsburgh has become more
corrupt and delinquent because of the ordinance is inane
to ponder.

The very argument that these people used is a legitimate
reason to have such a bill.

The question here is not a case of whether one’s sexual
orientation is right or wrong; rather, it is an issue of
human rights. When a group is persecuted for one reason
or another, laws must be made to protect that group from
discrimination.

Although the county law department said voters can
amend city charters, laws concerning human rights have
no right to be questioned. Should this ordinance be
repealed, this would be a dangerous message for all
minorities, including African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians,
those who don't practice the Judeo-Christian faith, etc.

Gays in our country and around the world have been
the victims of horrifying prejudice. Gay-rights activist and
politician Harvey Milk was "shot by Dan White, a San
Francisco city controller. White was an outspoken anti-
gay politician, yet he was found not guilty on the grounds
of temporary insanity.

The incidents of “queer-bashing” have escalated and
are not uncommon in Pittsburgh. Two years ago, a young
Pittsburgh man was beaten to death in Schenley Park, and
the longest sentence received by his assailants was one
year in jail. .

Regardless of whether Citizens for Pittsburgh has enough
legitimate signatures on its petition, the basic right not to
be discriminated against should -never be challenged
under any circumstance.

Campus responds to Yeager

The response to the petition in
The Pitt News concerning
campus police records has been
overwhelming. We have received
nearly 2, 000 signaturw, and we
thank all those who contributed.

Many people felt strongly
enough to put comments on their
petitions. Though we do not have
room to print all of them, we have
decided to print some of them.

We will continfte to ‘accept

petitions and they can be picked’ '

up in 434 WPU.

“The denial of public police
reports does not make sense on
a campus which claims to protect
its students to the best of its
ability.”

Brent Saunders
SGB president

"I find it hard to believe that Pitt
Vice President for Administration
John Yeager can condone denial
of important information from
the public. There could be a
rapist running rampant
throughout the campus, and the
general public would not be
informed — although I'd bet if
Yeager had a daughter living in
Oakland, she would be
informed."

Dennis Knorr

“By not making these reports
public to our students, the student
body is not only unaware of
crimes occurring around them,
but the people outside our
university have got to wonder
how safe the campus is for the
students because of this ridiculous
hindrance of our rights.”

Andrew Gould
SGB member

“First smoking, now this. What’s

next -— no salary increases?"
Rochelle Cook
Staff member

“The denial of public access to
police reports will do nothing but
invite more acts of crime to our
university. It's disappointing to

see how little the administration
really cares about its students

sometimes.”
M. Chad Wertz
SGB member

‘As a woman student and Pitt
staff member, I am furious that
information about assaults on
minority-group members and
women is being hidden from me!
I no longer live“in ademocracy."

Jacqueline Ellis
Staff member

“John Yeager insists that
denying public access to police
reports is not illegal in “Letters”
lFeb. 13]. However, John, it is
unethical. We are teaching ethics
at Pitt, and this case is one prime
example to explore."

Lily Maskew
Staff member

“I feel that The Pitt News has
shown the utmost discretion
until this point with regard to
police reports. Why curb their
ability to report by doing what
you've done?"

Gil Borok

"We, the students of this
institution, pay for our education.
In turn we make this campus a
proud place to be. No information
should be kept from us —— that
includes police reports — for our
safety and information!”

Mark Jakubowski

“I don't see what everyone is
getting so worked up about. After
all, this is just one morelstep
towards total censorship around
here and all across the United
States. What difference should it
make to us if the basic principles
of the Constitution are being
denied to us!...”

Angella Ferry

‘Once again the university and
its officials are treating us, its
students, as children. We do not
pay thousands of dollars for
tuition and expect to be babysat.

We expect to be educated, and
campus-police reports facilitate
our education of our university
and society."

Heather Cameron

‘The only pk: rpose I can see for
this measure is to allow the
university to brag about safety to
prospective students without fear
of possible contradiction." '

' Michael Greensteinv

“I feel that because students
pay a significant amount of money
to attend the University of

_ Pittsburgh, its administration owes

us, its financiers, an honest

account of the crimes that occur

in our campus community.”
Christine Trankiem

“This new policy makes me
wonder what the university has
to hide. For all my tuition money
I have paid, I have the right to
know what is going on at my
school."

Andrew Kies

“This is 1991, not 1984! By
taking away The”Pitt News’ First
Amendment rights, the university
is regressing to an Orwellian
standard.”

Eric Shiner

“It is necessary that students
and faculty be aware of crime on
campus in order to prevent further
problems. It would not look good
that the university is afraid to

print local crimes and news in the '

paper.”
Jennine Brown
Sheila Boes

“Considering the militaristic
mentality and experience of our
administration, this restriction on
the flow of information does not
surprise me, especially because
we have gotten used to it with the
censoring of news of the war in
the Persian Gulf.”

James Fischerkcllcr

Special images enter the mind
when defining the essence of
intensity.

These warriors are a rare and
very elite breed: Lawrence Taylor
of football’s New York Giants,
Charles Barkley of the
Philadelphia 76ers and Roger
Clemens of the Boston Red Sox
epitomize intensity.

So does Pitt wrestler Scott
Hovan.

Hovan, a redshirt junior from
Allentown, Pa., is currently
ranked fourth in the nation at the
158-pound weight class with a
sensational record of 25-2. He is
12-1 in dual-meet competition
and is undefeated in Eastern
Wrestling League competition.
His overall record in three seasons
at Pitt is an impressive 84-252.

In his freshman and sophomore
years, he finished second and
third, respectively, at the EWL
Championships, as well as
qualifying for the NCAAs in both
of those seasons. This season
Hovan is the top seed in the
tournament.

Before this season even began,

' expectations for Hovan were

extremely high. The Pitt varsity
sports yearbook said he ‘could
make a run at the national
championship this season.’

But the heavy burden of lofty
expectations has not deterred
Hovan from reaching his peak.
Hovan is primed and ready for
this weekend's EWL

 

‘BuAtHLErE§w£EK

Championships at Penn State.

“I like the challenge of going
out on the mat —-— it’s all up to
you, whether you win or lose. I
don’t think you can get that out of
many other sports,” he said.

Panther Coach Rande
Stottlemyer described Hovan as
“very focused.” That quality has
become increasingly valuable to
Hovan as he makes his run toward
a national championship.

“He hates to lose. That's an
attribute you find in a lot of
winners. He just hates to lose in
anything, and that can be a hell of
a motivator," said Stottlemyer.

“He’s what you call a
competitor. When you turn the
lights on, he lights up. That's his
time. When he puts the uniform
on, he is what I call ‘a gamer’,"
Stottlemyer added.

Hovan said that his mental
attitude has given him the extra
push that he needed this season.
He has learned to stay focused
and gives 100 percent throughout
the entire match. The results have
been gratifying. Losses are rare,
but Hovan has also learned how
to cope with the feeling of a loss.

‘I am very competitive. I don’t
like to lose, but you also have to
be realistic — it happens. If you
lose, you have to be able to
handle it so you can continue to
perform at the highest level
possible. I know from the
experience that you don’t let the

Pitt's Scott Hovan accumulated a 25-2 record in dual meet competition for the Panther wrestling team.

losses get to you because when it
comes down to it, the national
tournament is what counts.”

Hovan has reached success by
applying his own style on the mat
and attacking his opponent
quickly.

“When that whistle blows, it
only takes three or four seconds
for Scotty to get a shot off," said
Stottlemyer. “He sees nothing but
that guy in front of him, and he’s
ready to pound on him."

As a leader, Hovan tries to

bring out the best in his
teammates. ‘I think we have a lot
of guys with a lot of talent, and
sometimes people just don’t see
it in themselves, but others
around them see it," he said.

Hovan is vocal in practice and
at matches, always shouting
encouragement to his teammates.
By working hard at practice and
becoming mentally tough, he
has also led by example. Hovan
realizes that the Panthers have a
very bright future.

“It hasn't been a very good
season for the team, but I think
the attitude is pretty good. I think
the hard work this year will pay
off next season, even at the EWLs
this season,” he said.

Over the summer Hovan had
arthroscopic surgery on both
knees, which slowed him early in
the season. Mentally he remained
focused, but he wasn't in top
physical condition.

Now that he is healthy, he’s

don’tstart cursing yet; there are definite
advantages, especially in a small market

First of all, the money coming to our

Contracts between local teams and
cable companies will certainly aid the
various organizations financially. And
little of the money they are already
receiving would be lost due to national-
television contracts which provide
substantial revenue.

Baseball team begins Jackson era next week in Florida

By Bob Maselli
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther baseball team
has a new look this season after
the installation of veteran skipper
Mark Jackson. Jackson replaced
Bobby Lewis, who had been Pitt's
coach for 36 years, in August.

Jackson, who is in his 14th year
of coaching, brings a philosophy
to the Panthers that has made
him one of the most successful
coaches in the country. Jackson
compiled an impressive 291-53

record over eight years with the
Point Park College Pioneers. I

His last two teams at Point Park
went 40-5 and 496, respectively,
giving them the best records in
the nation. Jackson also was
named District 18 Coach of the
Year every year from 1985 to
1990.

Jackson realizes that it is going
to be tough changing the team
over to his style of coaching, but
so far he is satisfied with his
players, who have been practicing
since September.

“I’m new to the players, and

I any time you have a new coach,

he’s going to bring a new system,"
said Jackson. ‘'1 just expect the
players to adjust to the system
and have a commitment to the
team.”

The Panthers will be looking to
improve on a dismal 1990
campaign during which they
recorded eight wins and 23 losses.
The Panthers have 13 returning
lettermen, andJackson hopes that
experience will help the team
with its Big East schedule this

spring, especially with No. 25
Villanova. “I‘m not asking
anybody to play beyond their
ability,” said Jackson. “But if
everyone does what they have to
do individually, we can do what
we want to do as a team.

“The Big East is going to be
really tough, and there’s going to

“be strong competition, but if we

play to our ability level, we’ll win
some games.”

The Panthers will start the
season as they do every year,
with a spring-break trip to Florida,

where they will play 11 games in
nine days.

The trip will give Jackson a
chance to get the team ready for
the approximately 60-game
schedule ahead without having
to worry about snow or cold
weather. Pitt will meet with the
likes of Penn State, Northeast
Illinois, Central Florida, Akron,
Northwestern and St. Joseph, just
to name a few, in the “Boardwalk
and Baseball.”

Jackson doesn't want to set any

Women boopsters face Boston College in Big East tourney '

By Rob Mazur
Stag‘ Writer

’lhe Pitt Lady Panther basketball
team travels to Georgetown’s
Mcl)onough Arena for the 1991
\X/omen’s Big liast Basketball
Tournament this weekend. The
Lady Panthers enter the tourna-
ment as the No. 3 seed following
a disappointing 79-55 loss to top-
seeded Connecticut. ’lhe team
finished the regular season with
a 10-6 record in the Big East, 15-
12 overall.

'lhe Lady Panthers had upset
the Huskies 61-59 on Jan. 26 at
1-‘itzgerald Field House, breaking
the Huskies’ 1/r-game winning
streak. ’lhe Huskies, currently in
the Top 20, were out for revenge
Monday night in their re-match
with Pill.

Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce
said, “We ran into a hotbox. It
was their senior-recognition night
for two of the top players —
Kerry Bascom and laura Lishness
— ever to play in their program.
lt was really a hostile atmos-

phere."

The Lady Panthers had
momentum behind them. They
had just beaten the St. John's
lixpress to gain sole possession
of third place in the conference
behind Connecticut and Provi-
dence.

“We thought we could win,”
said Bnice. “We were coming off
our biggest win of the year, and
we had beaten them before. They
just played a great game. lt wasn't
a matter of us playing bad; they
just played great basketball.”

'lhe Huskies held Lady Panther
star Lorri Johnson to only seven
points — this after she burned St.
John's for 31.

“They just doubled up Lorri
and shut her down," said Bruce.

One bright spot for Pitt was
freshman guard Jill Colabrese,
who scored eight points while
playing both the point- and
shooting—guard positions.

“Jill did a really good job coming
in and playing both guard spots
against a top team in the nation,”
said Bruce.

In other scoring for Pitt, Jonna
lluemrich led the team with 12
points; lirin Maloy and Connie
Hurt each scored six.

The Lady Panthers won 10
conference games for the first
time since 1984-85. 'lheir third
place seeding ties the second
best ever for the team since it
joined the Big liast in 1982.

“This year has been quite an
accomplishment for us,” said
Bruce.

“Syracuse is the last—place team
in our conference, and they just

_ beat Rutgers, then ranked No. 12

in the nation," said Bruce. “This
just shows how powerful our
conference really is. It is going to
be hard to beat anyone because
it's a whole new season.”

If Pitt defeats BC in the first
round, it face the winner of the
Providence—Georgetown game.

around this city much longer.
With added revenue, maybe they
will l)e able to pay the tremendous
salaries players demand, which
make our teams as competitive
as they are.

And then there are the local
colleges. Colleges like Pitt or
Penn State could ensure that their
teams could get television
coverage every week. We only
get college football games once
a week, but they are not always
on. Now we can watch Pitt squeak
by Boston College as well as get

demolished by Miami.

But hey, what about us fans?
Ilow are we going to afford pay~
per-view? Well, the costs may not
be as steep as you may think.
One system that is drawing
attention is one where you pay
for what you watch. If you want
to watch the Penguins, you only
have to throw a switch, and then
and only then will you be charged
— sort of like the policy hotels
use for people who want to watch
a pay station. This way if you are
not interested in the Penguins --
maybe just the Pirates — then

you would only have to pay for
the Pirates.

Also, we will be able to listen to
announcers that actually care and
know about our teams.

Imagine watching the Steelers
move down the field and hearing
Myron (lope proclaiming this
drive as the drive that will carry
us to victory. Who cares if we are
losing 28-0?

And for those members of our
community that are not fans
(perish the thought) of the local
teams, you will not have to watch
them anymore. The cable

company can now arrange so
that you can sit back and watch
that all important Buffalo-Miami
matchup instead of sitting throu gh
the Steelers crushing some loser
team.

Once the game is well in hand
(probably by the end of the first
quarter), we can flip back to
catch Kelly and company make
that winning drive.

You have to face up to the
facts. Pay-per—view is on its way
in. And I think that is a whole lot
better than our local teams on
their way out.

Con

Continued from page 8
the rest of that cable junk mail!"
you say, growing intensely
nervous and irritated.

“Well, I did, and I'm watching
the Pirates game, so I’ll talk to
you later, guy,” he says and hangs
up.

Some friend, you think. But
hey, he’s watching the game, and
you're sitting there watching Joe
Shmoe putt from the 14th hole

for a quadruple bogey.

While this may sound a bit
contrived, the truth is that there is
a strong possibility that many
major sports teams are con-
sidering a move to pay—per~view.

Look, I pay my $40 for basic
cable plus installation and all that
jazz, and it's really a bunch of
baloney that I should have to pay
extra for another sports event.
Look at it this way: You’ll have to

pay for every hockey, baseball,
football or basketball game.

If you figure each game will
cost $4, and you want to see 110
games, well, that’s $440 for all of
the games, not including the $40
bill.

Another problem you might
want to consider is what happens
ifyou order a game, and then you
can't be home for that night.
You'll have to plan your evenings

around watching the game, or
you’ll be blowing the money.

My solution is simple. leave
the games on regular cable and
regular 'IV. Let's be realistic here
—— nobody’s going to be able to
watch every game, and no one is
going to carry a Pirates schedule
around with them to make plans.

The choice is rather simple:
Say “no" to pay-per-view, or say
“yes" to college golf.

He returned from this absence

this is a result of llovan’s

believes that if Ilovan stays
healthy, he will be "very
dangerous" at nationals.

The NCAA Championships will
be held March 14 through 16 at
the University oflowa, and Ilovan
is expecting more this time
around.

“I’ve had a chance to wrestle at
nationals twice already, so just
being there doesn't cut it,” he
said. “Tnere’s four or five returning
All-Americans at my weight. The
pressure is on them, not me.

“My goal is to be the national
champion. I know that’s what I
want to be. So mentally all I want
to do is go out and wrestle to the
best of my ability and not worry
about winning or losing."

Continued from page 2
Pitt’s IFC won three awards and
had two members appointed to
NEIFC positions.

One of the awards was for
member recruitment and
excellence in rush. Pitt’s IFC
received an award for its rush
publications and the rush
booklet, the Freshman Record.

The second award was for

publications, and it recognized
excellence in the Freshman
Record, a scholarship booklet
and the IFC newsletter.

Pitt's IFC also earned a special
achievement award for its “G reek
101" program. This program,
which was started last fall, focuses
on educating new members
about the Greek system.

Feldman was elected executive
vice president to the NIZIFC and
Darin McMuIlen, IFC president,
was elected as the area 3 vice
president.

john Demming, external vice

I

president, introduced a program ""

named Brothers and sisters
Against Drunk Driving (BADD).
“This would give us specific
drivers to drive drunk people
home safely, walk them to the
shuttle or call the university taxi
service," Demming said.

This program is already
established in West Virginia and
is working wonderfully, acc-
ording to Demming, Under this
program, two to four represent-
atives would be present at each
social function and be
responsible for anyone at the
party who needed assistance gett-
ing home. This program would
also Iimit liability for fraternities.

Carnegie Museum displays folk art, life in rain forest

By Mindy Boifemmyer
The Put News

The Carnegie Museum will
feature several traveling exhibits
in the coming months, including
a -few in the newly renovated
Natural History Gallery.

The new Natural History
Gallery has state-of—the-art climate
control and better security, which
will allow the museum to attract
traveling exhibitions of rare and
fragile materials that itwas unable
to accommodate before.

The Natural History Museum is
now displaying its own collection
of artifacts, photographs and
drawings .of the Yanomamo
Indians. The exhibit, Spirits of the
Rain Formt, has traveled since
1985 and has expanded since its
last appearance in Pittsburgh.

The Yanomamo live in
doughnut-shaped communal
homes, have no written language,
wear no clothing, use
rudimentary tools and subsist
through farming, hunting and
fishing

The way of life of the
Yanomamo, the. largest
unacculturated tribe in the world,
is in jeopardy because of the
increasing destruction of the
tropical rain forests of northern
Brazil and southern Venezuela.

Until the 19503 the Yanomamo
were virtually undisturbed by
20th-century civilization. They
had since been slowly accepting
the modernizing influence of
missionaries, highway workers
and miners until the arrival of
gold prospectors in 1987.

__ _I:u_red to the area by one of the

world's richest deposits of gold,
the prospectors, or “garimpeiros,"
have denuded large tracts of
forest, poisoned rivers with
mercury and introduced diseases
to which the Yanomamo have no
resistance.

In order to help museu m~goers
gain an understanding of the
Yanomamo, the Carnegie is also
offering a slide-show lecture
series. A lecture entitled, “The
Yanomamo: Can They Survive in
the Forest?" will be presented
today by William Smole, professor
of anthropology at Pitt.

On March 7, Barbara Baker,
director of the Pittsburgh Zoo,
will discuss the rain—forest
complex that will soon open at
the zoo in her lecture, “Building
a Tropical Forest.”

Spirits of the Rain Forestwill run
through June 16 at the Carnegie
Museum of Natural History.

Upcoming temporary exhib-
itions to be shown in the new
gallery will include “Pretty
Deadly: Poisonous Plants of
Forest, Field,” “The Funny Side
of Science: An Exhibition of
Cartoons by Sidney Harris,”
“Garden” and ‘Portraits of Nature:
Paintings of Robert Bateman.”

O O O

The Carnegie Museum of Art is
displaying “Treasure of American
Folk Art," the most important
collection of its kind in the United
States by virtue of its size,
numerous rare works, works by
well-known American folk artists
and its broad geographical
representation.

Folk art is the product of
untrained artists working outside

 

“Everything made from scratch
the old-fashioned way.”

the mainstream of formal and
academic art. Because the artists
are unfamiliar with the academic
ways ofdealing with perspective,
color or anatomy, they solve these
problems intuitively with unique
approaches to color and media.

The traveling exhibition
includes more than 180 of the
most important works in Abby

Aldrich Rockefeller’s collection,
including portraits, weathervanes,
decoys, quilts, toys, trade signs
and painted farm scenes.

lts highlights include paintings
by Edward Hicks of Bucks
County, Pa., portraits by Ammi
Phillips, drawings by Lewis Miller,
table and bed covers, pottery and
furniture.

In light of the impending
depression in the Soviet Union,
you would think that ﬁlmmakers
would take advantage of glasnost
and create films that escape from
tin reality that surrounds them
every day.

‘After all, the Depression at the
end of the 1920s gave way to
Hollywood and movie-making.
That's what's happening in Russia
right now. We don't need any
horror ﬁlms because standing in
linetobuycheese foradayis
enough of a horror,’ said Marina
Zvereva, scriptwriter_ of the film
Defense Council Sedou.

Soviet filmmakers are indeed
taking advantage of glasnost. But
instead of making escapist films,
they are making documentary
films of historical signiﬁcance.
Sometimes exposingthetruth can
be a trying experience for a
ﬂlmmakerlin the Soviet Union.

So What

Zvereva said, “I think that times
now are so psychologically
difficult, that people don't want
to experience what is not
pleasant" In fact, it wasn't until
Zvereva's film won many prizes
and awards at Western film
festivals that it was shown in the
Soviet Union. A‘

At a recent Soviet film
delegation sponsored by the
University of Pittsburgh, four of
the five films shown were
documentaries. The newfound
popularity of the documentary
has stemmed from the desire for
the truth to be told through the
eyes of the filmmakers. Most of
the filmmakers feel that glasnost
has had a positive effect on the
filmmaking process because
many government records that
were once closed are now open
to the public.

Zvereva said, ‘The archives are
just beginning to be opened up,
so there's a bottomless barrel of
infom1ation." Zvereva's film is a
dramatized documentary about
the paranoia that occurred during
the Stalin-era purge trials. The

film became very personal to her
because she was, in a sense,
finishing what her late father had
started.

“My father was a writer. He
wrote a short story about the
trials, and it was only published
once in Brezhnev’s time. I’ve
always felt that I had to continue
what he had started,” she said.

Other filmmakers at the
delegation are also taking
advantage of this newfound
access to once—hidden
documents. Leonid Gurevich,
scriptwriter for the documentary
The Mission of Raoul Wallenberg
looks upon his film as a historical
attempt to research what the
Soviet powers did to Wallenberg.
His use of historical data gives
the film its edge.

Wallenberg, who fought
vehemently for the liberation of
Jews, is viewed as a savior of the
people in Russia, yet there are
many questions surrounding his
death. The most important
question seems to be, “Is he
really dead, or is it just another lie
fed to the people by the

Marina Goldovskaia director of Solovetslzy Power and Tbe Taste of C

Freedom

government?" This question is
what propels the film.

Gurevich said, “When we
made this film, we had to ask
ourselves, ‘Are we going to talk
about who this man was and
where he came from, or are we
going to talk about the crimes of
the Soviet government?”’

The crimes committed by the
Soviet government is a common
theme in these films. Director
Marina Goldovskaia explored
the horrors of the Solovetsky

Her film reveals the frightening
political climate in the '20s and
’30s, when writers, engineers and
many other f ree-thinkers were sent
to Solovetsky to be “re—educated."

Goldovskaia’s other film, A Taste

an outspoken television journalist.
She said, “It is a film about myself,
how I feel when I wake up every

Poets deliver message & beat

 

Monica Novak
Stqﬂ‘ Writer

“There is no basic face to Scratch
Poets fan,” says M. Christian
Robinson, “founding father and
spiritual leader” of the poetic
foursome.

They hushed a crowd of
skinheads. They made a group
of elderly church women get up
and shake their “groove thing."
They attracted fans of house, punk
and rap.

The Scratch Poets appeal to
such a diverse audience because
they draw from many genres.
Call it performance art; call it
experimental music ——their name
says it all. The Scratch Poets
perform scratch poetry, original
poems delivered with a rap beat.

drive home its theme.

Together since May 1990, the
Scratch Poets have experimented

with this relatively new art form,

performing at places such as the
Frick Fine Arts Building, The

Artery and The Turmoil Room.

Robinson, a five—foot bundle of
energy who keeps the group's

show alive with his antics, says,

“Poetry started offwith the masses
the
academia. We are trying to bring

and then elevated to

poetry back to the street.”

The Scratch Poets feel that, in
the words oflce T, they belong to
“the first generation of talking

niggers.”

from U2, Kraftwerk, jello Biafra
and Public Enemy (just to name
a few) to fit a poem’s topic and

“Rap in the ")0s is a viable use
of communication; it helps people
to think,” says Robinson.

Yet, “you hear so much
negativity on rap, the positive
never comes out," says Bang.

“Public linemy was here twice
in 1990 and you never heard that
there was no violence at either
concert,” says Khalil Vennie.
Vennie comes from a family of
writers and began writing
seriously at the age of 13.

The Scratch Poets are trying to
lift the hideous lie that Americans
are living under — the lie hiding
racism, inequality, injustice and
mainly ignorance.

“America is living a lie,” says
newest member ofthe group, 41-
year—old Earl Jones, with a calm
reserve that reflects his wisdom
and maturity. “America is a place
where cowboys always win and
Elvis is king. America was
founded on the lie that we are
better than everyone — that God
is always on our side. We have
to look behind the screen.”

The media manipulates the
minds of Americans and alters
their perceptions about the black
culture, said the Poets. “So much
knowledge is being kicked by
rappers, but there is so much of
it being ignored by white culture
that it doesn't make sense," says
Robinson. “It's like Bobby Porter
from Thin White Line. That man
has been kicking it for years, and
he’s been kicking it damn hard.

Literary magazine
features local talent

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Prom dense aesthetic
caresses to brutal assaults upon
the sensory system, the
premiere issue of The
Pittsburgh Quarterly presents
a literary magazine that is well-
crafted and rich in talent.

Cited as a “community
writing project” by editor and
publisher Prank (Iorrenti, this
magazine is actually a
combination of talent from
the Southwest, New England,
New York and even Greece.

The bulk of this booklet is
poetry, including work from
Pitt’s own Dennis Brutus. The
poems are largely diverse and
thought-provoking (although
some seem to be used as filler
between the more striking
works). Subjects range from
African awareness and lesbian
bars to the omnipresent death
motifs.

Linda Watkins, a poet from
Homewood, contributes one
of the strongest and most
horrifying poems, “Pillage (For
Tawana)”...

Paul Simon's music isn’t heard much on
the radio these days. It doesn’t fit the Top
40 formula well enough for stations like B—
94 to play it. He isn't hip enough for
college radio, and he is all but ignored by
the classic—rock stations.

Today, Paul Simon doesn’t need to rely
on radio to sell his albums. Beginning with
his 1986 release, Graceland, and now with
his most recent album, The Rhythm of the
Saints, Simon has re-established himself
as one of the most respected artists in the
music industry. Along with other inﬂuential
musicians like David Byrne and Peter
Gabriel, he has pushed the boundaries of
popular music to include such previously
ignored sounds as the rhythms of Africa
and Brazil.

With Yhekhytbm oftheSaz'nL§, Simon has
shifted his focus from the African sounds
of Graceland to a more mellow,
percussion-based Brazilian style.

Its opening track (and first single), “The
Obvious Child,” kicks off the album with
a barrage of crisp drumming by a team of
native Brazilians. The percussion, matched

with Simon's simple strumming, prepares
the listener for the rest of the songs.
From there, the next nine tracks stream
together into an intelligent blend of subtle
guitars and upbeat lyrics which combine
to form an album that is every bit as

impressive as his triple—platinum

Graceland.

Simon will be recreating the sound of
his last two albums on his current “Born at
the Right Time" tour, featuring a 17-piece
band. His touring band consists of three
guitarists, five percussionists, three backing
vocalists, two keyboardists, a bassist and
a three—person horn section. In addition to
his recent material, he has been playing
updated versions ofSimon and Garfunkel
classics like “Cecilia,” and the duo’s
signature song, “Bridge Over Troubled
Water.”

Paul Simon and his band will bring this
show to Pittsburgh’s Civic Arena on Sunday,
March 10. lfyou’re looking for a spectacle
of dancers, lights and props, looI<

quality entertainment to end your spring
break, do yourselfa favor. Skip the “Married

interview, conducted by Sue
Powers, an artist in Brooklyn,
N .Y., concentrates on Lardas’ own
poetry and some translation of
Greek mourning songs. “The
kinds of images I use are Greek,

grew up in Pittsburgh, I always

that is not a documentary is a
satire directed by Yuri Mamin
called Sideburns. The film
introduces us to a group of rowdy,
oversexed youths who call
themselves Capella. This group
lives on the streets and destroys
virtually everything with which it
comes in contact.

When another youth group,
possibly more warped than
Capella, establishes itselfin town,
Capella falls by the wayside, and
the Pushkin Club takes over.
This club dresses in 19th-century
garb, grows long sideburns and
establishes poet Alexander

Pushkin as its idol, quoting him
meticulously every time the
opportunity presents itself.

The film becomes a triumph
for the politically right—wing
Pushkin Club over the liberal
Capella. Through the comic
portrayal of the battling youth
groups, Mamin manages to spin
out an entertaining narrative of
the emergence of the right wing.

Even though Mamin chose to
make a satire, documentary films
are still very popular in Russia.
Zvereva said, ‘The documentary
is a way to show new generations
that we are not telling lies."
