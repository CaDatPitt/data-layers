Protdenied tenure despite
favorable student reviews

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Sandy Kita loosens his brown tie
and he rolls up his sleeves, even
though it’s only an hour into the work
day. He scans his desk, his eyes pour-
ing over the papers piled upon papers
in front of him. ‘

His office, tucked away in a corner
of the Frick Fine Arts Building, fits
the bill of one belonging to an over-
worked professor. The shelves are
lined with books, some written in
English, most in Japanese. He leans
back in his reclining chair and studies
the grading chart on his computer
screen.

But Kita doesn’t only look like the
part, he lives it. Long hours spent
researching, writing and teaching are
the norm for Kita, an assistant profes-
sor in the History of Art and
Architecture Department, specializing
in Japanese art history.

Like any other Pitt assistant profes-
sor with the proper qualifications,
Kita recently- applied ,.to become
tenured and thus promoted to an asso-
ciate professor.

But his bid was denied, frustrating
and upsetting many of his students
who have had him before and consid-
er him to be one of the best at the uni-
versity.

“He takes an interest with each

Timber

individual,” says Mary Preston, one
of Kita’s former students who helped
start a letter-writing campaign to
force the department of Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, headed by Peter
Koehler, to reconsider its decision not
to tenure Kita. g

Koehler said he could not comment
directly on Kita’s situation because
every tenure conﬂict at the school is
confidential, but an appeal in these
situations is “not unusual.”

Kita has been teaching at Pitt since
1988, and before that he spent nine
years as an assistant professor at the
University of Wisconsin. He has a
bachelor’s degree from Northwestern
and a master’s and a doctorate from
the University of Chicago. He’s had
eight articles on Japanese art history
published over the last 12 years and
has one book forthcoming in March.
Another book was accepted for publi-
cation last year.

Kita says one of the reasons he was
turned down is because of his unique
teaching style that forces his students

to ....‘5c;orn_e ,to class and be.co_me.

involved in the learning process.”

“As much as possible, I try to get
the students to think by themselves,”
he says. “My teaching style can’t be
evaluated with a one-time faculty
visit. I’m the only person in the
department who does it this way.”

Lon , bumpy

roa to tenure

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

It was designed to ensure academic
freedom, but achieving tenure status
at Pitt for some professors is an emo-
tional climb up a mountain that kept
one untenured professor “up all night
for months.”

And if successful, tenure will give a
professor academic freedom, and the
most important aspect to some —— job
security. But the path taken to reach
tenure can be a minefield for Pitt pro-
fessors. (See story at left.)

Each school at the university .has
different rules and regulations for
giving tenure, but for every professor
at Pitt the tenure process starts when
they are hired by a department to
serve as an assistant professor. That’s
the easy part.

After six years as an assistant in the
College of Arts and Sciences, a pro-
fessor is eligible to become tenured.
According to Pitt’s faculty handbook,
that means the professor is given,a-
“status accorded members of univer-
sity faculty who have demonstrated
high ability and achievement in their
dedication to the growth of human
knowledge.” '

“It’s extremely shattering on the

JERUSALEM — Thousands of
Ethiopian Jews clashed with riot
policemen outside the prime
minister’s office in a protest over
the news that blood they donated
was secretly dumped out of fear
that it was contaminated with the
virus that causes AIDS.

Israeli officials have said the
blood that was accepted was
Ethiopians’ and surreptitiously
thrown out so as not to stigma-
tize the donors publicly. The
realization that their blood was
rejected seemed to unleash a
pent—up sense of humiliation and
discrimination among Israel’s
60,000 Ethiopian Jews, an
ancient branch of the Jewish
people who were brought to
Israel in two airlifts in 1984-85

Tenure

°From page'I

nerves to go through a
process like this,” said one
Pitt tenured professor, who
wished to remain anony-
mous.

Another professor, who’s
not tenured, said, “It’s a
nerve-wracking process,
filled with a lot of anxiety.”

After an assistant profes-
sor becomes eligible for
tenure, the ball is rolling.
Tenured teachers from
his/her department observe
classes. Teaching evalua-
tion scores from the Office
of Teaching and Evaluation
are taken for review, as well
as course syllabi.

The tenured faculty of the
academic department vote
on whether or not to give
the assistant tenure, and the
department chair then
makes a recommendation to
Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Dean Peter
Koehler.

Koehler, who has been at
Pitt for 10 years, then gets
somewhat of a final say.
His decision can be
appealed by the assistant
professor if, according to
Koehler, the appeal is
“based on a violation of
procedure.”

After that appeal, it’s pos-
sible that a final decision

could be made by Pitt

away from tenure can also
turn to the University
Senate for help. The Senate
has a tenure and academic
freedom committee, headed
by English professor
Richard Tobias and medical
school professor Carey
Balaban.

That committee can’t
reverse decisions, but it can
place turned down profes-
sors on the right track.
Some of the more recent
complaints the committee
has heard include inade-
quate consideration and
gender discrimination.

If an assistant professor
gets approved for tenure,
the next step is associate
professor. Besides tenure,
that post comes with a
salary increase and puts the
teacher on the next track to
becoming a full-fledged

. professor.

That final post, professor,
“recognizes the attainment
of authoritative knowledge
and reputation in a recog-
nized field,” according to
the faculty handbook.

Attaining professor status
at Pitt is the summit of the
tenure mountain.

WHAT IS T
FUTURE OF T
TENURE SYSTEM?

HE
HE

‘‘It’s a small price to pay
for academic freedom,”

University Senate president,
summing up why he
believes the idea of tenur-
ing professors must remain
part of academic life at Pitt.

“Tenure is absolutely
essential,” says another Pitt
professor, who despite
already being , tenured,
wished to remain anony-
mous.

While many tenured and
untenured professors agree
with McDuffie, there are
some administrators and
even other professors at Pitt
and across the country who
believe the tenure process
should be abolished.

A plan to abolish tenure
in Oklahoma narrowly
escaped Gov. Frank
Keating’s desk last fall.
According to a recent issue
of Academe, pressure from
the Oklahoma AAUP was a
major factor in saving
tenure. _

McDuffie, who’s in the
middle of hisfirst year as
University Senate president,
realizes the risk of giving
someone “a job for life.”

“If you’re not careful, you
could appoint people to
[tenure] who are not going
to do much after they are
tenured,” he says.

Stephen Trachtenberg,

istration professor at

ing” distaste for tenure.

“Distaste for tenure has
been intensified by a vari-
ety of ‘scandals,’ including
widespread media coverage
on the subjects of grade
inflation and the alleged
failure of some tenured pro-
fessors to pay any attention
to their students at all,”
wrote Trachtenberg.

Trachtenberg could not be
reached for comment, but
he stated in his article a
possible solution to fix
tenure would be “actively
supporting the notion of
defined and limited teach-
ing contracts.”

Pitt is not the only school
that has had controversy
over awarding tenure.

The University of
Pennsylvania ran into
tenure problems last year
when two assistant profes-
sors, one from the English
department and one from
the geology department,
were denied tenure.-

Both professors were
well-liked by most of their
students, but .university
officials cited a lack of
accomplished research as a
reason for their failed
attempt at tenure.

Despite the controversy
tenure brings to college
campuses across the coun-
try, McDuffie believes it’s
here to stay.

“It’s not something I’d

“His teaching style is dif-
ferent, but it’s a much more
valuable way to learn,” says
Todd Williams, a Pitt senior,
who has had Kita for several
classes. “He’s dedicate-J not
only to our learning, but also
our thinking process.”

Williams, along with
Preston and Pitt student
Caryn Holupka, has been
working on a petition of fel-
low classmates who support
Kita. .

In the letter from Koehler
denying Kita tenure,

obtained by The Pitt News, .

the dean states that the
tenured faculty of the HA&A
department voted unani-
mously to reject Kita’s
tenure proposal.

Koehler writes that
although the faculty felt
“through hard work you have
overcome complaints made
by students in the early eval-
uations of your classes,” the

complaints from his col--

leagues linger, such as “lack

of class organization and‘

ineffective use of class
time.”

But besides his “unique
teaching style,” Kita says a
reason for his denial is that
he “doe'sn’-t fit the [depart-
ment’s] image of academia.”

PIKA (Pi Kappa Alpha) fraternity, is a communications
major at Pitt. He said that he has accomplished more
than he ever imagined by his junior year.

He said that he wants people to think of him as the
guy-next—door, regardless of his accomplishments.

“One of the biggest lessons that I learned at a very
early age was humility,” he said. “I believe that every-
one excels in their own area in many different ways.
Nobody is really better than anybody else.”

Zolghadri spent last summer as an intern for ABC
News in New York City.

He said that one of his biggest accomplishments was
covering the highlights of the women’s French Open
tennis ﬁnal between Stefﬁ Graf and Aranxta Sanchez-
Vicario for the ABC evening news.

“I was told by the producer that I had 30 seconds of
air time to cover this event,” he said. “I was given a
great deal of independence to pick the best shots, and he
chose my clips.”

Zolghadri said that living in New York was an unfor-
gettable learning experience for him because it was a
different atmosphere from the Pitt campus that he is
familiar with. _

' “Living in New York broadened my horizons,” he
said. “Things that are different are often seen as odd or
unusual, but I learned to appreciate other people’s talents
rather than to judge by my own standards.”

Zolghadri was one of the 25 interns chosen from over
125 applicants. His employers based their decisions on
the students’ majors, school activities, classes taken and
interviews. His responsibilities included covering high-

lights for the evening news, helping sportscasters write

scripts and assisting with live studio and post-production
procedures.

Zolghadri was recently elected to the Student
Government Board. He said that he decided to run for
SGB because he wanted to be in a position where he
could persuade other students to make the most of their
college experience, both academically and socially.

“I feel that the majority of my activities were Greek,
which was fine,” he said. “But I wanted to be in a posi-
tion where I could inﬂuence a more diverse group of

people on a broader
level, like the entire stu-
dent body.”

Zolghadri said that
one of his goals as an
SGB member is to pre-
pare students for the
competitive job market.

“Something that I’d
like to do is open stu-
dents’ eyes to internship
possibilities,” he said.
“It’s a great experience
and an excellent way to
break into the job mar-
ket, because many com-
panies offer their interns
permanent jobs after
graduation.” ’

Joe Cavalla, director
of Student Activities,
expressed his approval
for Zolghadri’s interest
in obtaining diverse
leadership roles.

“Cyrus has always
been extremely involved

with Greek life, but now
he is expanding his horizons from Greek life to the

‘entire student body with SGB,” he said. “It’s a great path
to take, and I give him a lot of credit.”

Zolghadri said that being a member of the Greek sys-
tem has given him the opportunity and experience he
needs to be a good leader. , I

“The Greek system in general has given me direc-
tion,” he said. “It has given me something to contribute
my time and energy towards and feel a great sense of
accomplishment.”

Zolghadri said that being a member of the Pika frater-
nity has helped him obtain many leadership roles where
he had opportunities to organize events with students
like himself.

He joined Pika when he was a freshman in 1993 and
held the position of Interfraternity Council representa-

tive for his fraternity. .

“Being a Pika member is one of the best experiences
in my life,” he said. “The experiences that I’ve had with
my brothers are the most memorable.”

Matt Sespico, a senior member of Pika, has known
Zolghadri since his freshman year.

“As busy as Cyrus has been, he has always made time
for me when I needed him, and that’s important.” he
said. “I consider him one of my best friends.”

Zolghadri was a member of the IFC Judicial Board
and chairman of a 5k run/walk that raised over $l0.000
for Special Olympics in 1994. He was the Fun and
Games chair for Greek Week, Blood Drive chairman
and IFC vice president of membership recruitment dur-
ing Fall 1995. He proposed a Junior IFC for new mem-

a yearly rise in his evalua-
tions from his students. In
the spring of 1991, he aver-
aged an overall score of
under seven, with 10 being
the highest. In the fall of
1994 for the same class, Kita
averaged just under nine,
scoring a nine nine times. He
was recently inducted into
the Phi Etma Sigma fraterni-
ty for individual teaching
achievements.

“When students get togeth-
er and nominate you for a
teaching award, you’re doing
something right,” says Kita,
who despite the looming
possibly that he will not be
tenured at Pitt, continues to
work hard for his students.

His colleagues in the
HA&A department praise
him, even though they all
voted against his tenure pro-
posal.

“I regard Sandy as a
friend,” says tenured profes-

,:sor Anne H.ar_ris..“'We felt

very sorry that the decision
is what it is, [but] it was a
professionally based deci-
sion.”

Koehler says Kita’s appeal,
like every other one in the
College of Arts and
Sciences, must be based on a
“violation of procedure.”

The root of Kita’s appeal is
based on Koehler’s decision
“not to appoint an ad—hoc
committee to consider [his]
dossier,” Kita wrote in his
appeal letter to the FAS
dean;

Koehler will make a deci-
sion on the appeal soon, but
Kita can appeal again, this
time to the provost’s office.

Kita sayshe would like to
continue teaching even if it
can’t be at Pitt, but he is
aware of the difficulty he’ll
have in landing another pro-
fessor post after being
denied tenure at Pitt-

“I really enjoy teaching,”
he says. “I would like to con-
tinueon.” '

bers and pledges before the end
of his term that would include
educating new members and
promoting group unity. .

Zolghadri said that the Rush
Facilitator Program —— which
stresses Greek unity and
attempts to alleviate competi-
tiveness, and which he helped
organize ——- isn’t doing as well
as he hoped. He said that Pat
Callahan, the new IFC vice
president, is working on irnprov—
ing the program.

Zolghadri said that one of his
major accomplishments within
the Greek system was lobbying
for fraternity housing. He
worked on the program through-
out last semester with Vice
Chancellor John DeVitto and
attended community workshops.

Zolghadri was recently select-
ed to the Greek Life Imperative
Commission set up by Dr. Leon
Haley, vice chancellor for stu-
dent and public affairs, consist-
ing of administrators, alumni
and students. Its purpose is to
perform a comprehensive evalu-
ation of all aspects of Greek life
to acknowledge its weaknesses
and establish improvements.

Zolghadri said that this is the
first year that such a committee
has existed. Pitt is following a
national example set by the
University of Maryland last

year.

Zolghadri was born on Dec. 3,
1974, in Reading, Pa., where he
graduated from Wyomissing
Area High School in 1992. He
was the sports editor of his high
school newspaper, The Chariot,
and a member of the varsity ten-
nis team for four years. He
became involved in theater and
performed in the play
“Oklahoma.”

Zolghadri said that-the people
he admires the most are his par-
ents.

“They’ve been through a lot,”
he said. “I’m really proud of
their accomplishments and have
gained a sense of direction from
them.”

Zolghadri played tennis for
three years at Pitt and was the
recipient of the Pitt Scholar
Athlete Award in 1993 and
1994.

George Dieffenbach, Pitt
men’s tenniscoach, said that
Zolghadri was a dedicated ath-
lete.

“The main thing about Cyrus
is that he is always interested in
helping the community,” he
said. “He made his contribution
on the tennis team as a hard
worker that was always con-
cerned with improvement to
strengthen his game. He gave
everything he had to help Pitt’s
tennis team win.”

Zolghadri said that his admi-

ration and appreciation for the- _

ater has dramatically increased
since high school. He has taken
many acting classes at Pitt. He
also took professional classes
conducted by Steven Black, a
Los Angeles actor, his sopho-
more year through Herbert
Berghov Studio in New York
while he was interning at ABC
News last summer.

Zolghadri said that one of his

‘most rewarding experiences,

ironically, didn’t have anything
to do with Greek life, communi-
cations or acting.

It was working as a camp
counselor over the past three
summers for 12-year-old boys at
camp Na—Sho-Pa in
Bloominburgh, New York in the
Catskill mountains.

“Spending the summer with
those kids was just amazing,” he
said. “It was so much fun, and

the best part was that they. really
look up to you.”

Zolghadri isn’t sure what the
future has in store for him, but
he said that he hopes to become
involved with the mass media

“I’ve always been interested
with the media in general,
because it’s the one thing that
connects everybody’s life
together,” he said. “And to play
a part in that would give me a
great sense of accomplishment.”

Eat, drink & pay taxes

Buy a bottle of vodka in Giant Eagle? A bottle of wine in
PharMor? A single bottle of beer or a wine cooler at the local 7-
ll? If you are from Pennsylvania (or one or two other states)
this probably sounds like a dream. But if you have ever trav-
elled the 45 or so minutes it takes to getto Ohio, you know that
you can walk into any grocery store and buy the alcohol of your
choice.

But not in the grand old Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

If you want to drink anything harder than beer, you have to go
to a state—run liquor store, a “Wine & Spirits Shoppe” (the
archaic spelling is quite appropriate). In order to buy anything
less than a case of beer, you have to buy it from a bar, usually at
top prices. You have to buy a whole case from distributors.
(Doesn’t it seem odd that the state makes it more difficult for
people to purchase smaller amounts of alcoholic beverages?)
And forget it on Sundays. You can’t buy more than two six-
packs on a Sunday, and no hard alcohol (including wine) at all.
Sorry, the Super Bowl will just have to be moved to Monday
next year for those of us in Pennsylvania.

The reasoning behind having state—run liquor stores is really
unclear. Some arguments say that it makes it more difficult for

underage drinkers to get alcohol. What? How many people do

you know never had a mixed drink or glass of wine before their
21st birthday because they couldn’t buy a bottle themselves?
Further, if the LCB is intended to control alcohol sales, there
should be no problem enforcing the law if liquor sales were
expanded beyond the state stores. You have to show ID anyway,
so what difference does it make if you show it to the clerk at the
state store or at Giant Eagle?

State—run liquor stores are one of the only govemment-spon-
sored monopolies left in the country. No one seems to realize
that, by having the only sales outlet for liquor, the state domi-
nates the market. This allows no competition, and therefore no

market-driven pricing. The state can charge whatever it wants to

for a bottle of wine, and consumers are screwed in the process.
_-States. which do not have monopolies on liquor sales (far out-

:-ji nuinberihg-statesi~ which do‘)! sitill“requir‘e liquor sales outlets to
_ apply for and purchase liquor licenses. If Pennsylvania switched

to this plan, the state would gain the income from licensing, and
drop the overhead expenses of running the stores. In 1994, 53
state liquor stores finished the year with significant financial
losses, to be paid for by (you got it) the taxpayers. If the liquor
market were privatized and publicized, taxpayers would not
have to swallow that loss.

Liquor stores were instituted after the end of Prohibition in
order to ease alcohol back into society (or vice versa). But
Prohibition has been gone for a long time, and the state stores
have outlived their usefulness. Monopolies went out around 70
years ago. The state liquor stores should have gone with them.

State of theUnion campaign

0 here I sit with the weight
Sof another column on my

oft times (this is one) over-
taxed brain. I have been follow-
ing the developments in
Bosnia/Croatia quite closely and
as it has faded from the front
page, I fmdvI’m more than a lit-
tle annoyed with the “powers
that be.” It seems (in the opinion

— of the president and his staffers)

that this is the perfect time for
the president to show he’s
“with” the military. I’ve read the
“Peace Agreement” signed in
Dayton and it leaves me with a
number of fears; however, what
frightens me worse is the reac-
tion on the ‘home front” by, you
guessed it, the politicians.

First and foremost, let’s look
at the Republican majority in
Congress. Bob Dole, the
estimable Grand Old Man of the
Grand Old Party, was "a little
slow to back the president.
Seems he had to check the polls
to see if the people were backing
El Presidente. There were some
grumblings in Congress as to
whether or not the finances
would be made available "to con-
tinue the mission, “long term.”
Hey, if you’re a presidential
hopeful you’d better not even
consider leaving our troops out
there without the full support of
our govemment’s resources.

As for the Newter, well you
can guess if Big Bill is for it,
he’s against it unequivocally.
Seems that the supporters of the
Grand Old Party can’t find a
bottom line amount (read cash
advantage) that suits them. Not
to bore any of you who may still
be reading this column with a
history lesson, but does this ring
any bells regarding the Kurds
after Desert Storm? After we
ceased hostilities Saddam pro-
ceeded to kill almost a million
Kurds, and what did the
“Victors” do about it? Nothing
other than say, “Hey, you better
stop that.” The Kurds didn’t
have. anything we needed so 
too bad, so sad. The prevailing
feeling now that their guy isn’t

Patrick!
McKelvey

the Boss is “What’s in it for us?”
No, no little pilgrims, it ain’t
about Money, Oil & Power.
Guess what, campers, there’s
nothing of ﬁnancial value to us
in Bosnia either.

This is not to excuse the-slop-
piness of the president’s presen-
tation of why we should be in
Bosnia. Anybody who has been
in a barroom brawl knows that
the most dangerous place to be
in a ﬁght is between the drunks.
No one wants us there, everyone
hates each other and, to be frank
about it, they have no compunc-
tion about killing Americans.
When exactly we are leaving or
what exactly our “group goal”
here is has yet to be adequately
explained by W.J. Clinton.
Could we be trying to get re-
elected here? Does the name
George Bush ring any bells?

After watching Big 'Bi1l’s
“vote for me!” speech, I was dis-
gusted. Mayhaps I’m an old
fashioned sort of fella, but it
seems to me that the State of the
Union Address should cover
things like the fact that 20,000 of
our soldiers are in an environ-
ment that is a WAR ZONE!!!
Or, if we lack other topics, spe-
cific goals (notice I didn’t‘ say
touchy-feely ideas) of our
national interests and how we
will achieve them. Notice I
didn’t include in this list the
strict admonitions that we
should check homework or be
involved in the community. As
my mother said, “It is unbecom-
ing for Clinton, Dole or Newt to
preach to me about family val-
ues. It’s inappropriate for these
guys to preach family values.”
She is a little more verbose on
that particular subject, but it’s
my column and she can write
about in her own if she wishes.
Sorry. As always, I digress.

For those of you out there
rejoicing my Prodigal Son-esque
return to the Republican party, I
have two words: don’t bother.

The Grand Old Man Dole’s “Big
Bill-is-such-a-liar-and-I’ll-shut-
down-the-government—whenev-
er-I-want-to-’cause-I-can-and-
by-the-way—I’m-the-man-for-
the-job” speech left me equally
repulsed. It seems that these
folks are of the opinion that We
The People are stupid, ignorant
sheep that never read past the
fast paragraph or listen beyond a
30-second sound bite. After all,
we all know that the average
American reads voraciously and
watches 30 hours of TV a week;
mostly high-quality program-
ming on jfgbgfz bkre uq
*67mf#@%&"  sorry, just
checking on your attention span.
My editor, in her own gentle
and nurturing way, tells me I

should get to the point in this '

meandering epistle, so here it is:
my version of the State of the
Union Address:

“Hi! We’re the folks that are
messing up your lives through
painfully high taxes and debts of
unfathomable proportions. We
have sent your daughters and
sons to a far-off land with no
attainable mission, no responsi-
bilities for enforcing the war
crimes they find there and an
opportunity to be despised and
targeted by all indigenous per-
sonnel. We have grossly mis-
managed your money in the past
and, in our squabbling over how
we will spend your money in the
future, have closed down the

- support services of the govem-

ment (excluding, of course, our
own bloated staffs, offices and
all attendant perks). We know
that you’re mad and it’s the other
party’s’ fault. Please elect one of
us (we know that only half of
you vote anyway) so we can all
stick it to you some more. Thank
you for being such suckers, and
goodnight.”

These jokers bear serious
watching don’t they?

thinking Independent who prays

American people.

Voicing their opinions

KOVCll( takes it
on the chin

After reading Mike Kovak’s com-
mentary about the Steelers and the
Super'Bowl, I found that I have to dis-
agree with him on a number of state-
ments that he made.

First, he states that the Steelers have
the best following in organized sports.
For starters, the NY Rangers have a
better following. There are some fans
who waited 54 years before seeing
their team finally bring home the cup
again. What about soccer in foreign
countries? Soccer is life in many of
these countries. The size of the follow-
ings of some teams from Brazil, Italy,
Germany and England are staggering.
More people watch the World Cup than
any other sporting event in the world.

Mike also states that many students
here at Pitt come from cities where
sports fans suck, such as New York.
New York City and the surrounding
area supports two football, two basket-
ball, three hockey and two baseball
teams. Granted, they have many more
people there, but the real fans there are
not “fair weather” fans like most sports
fans from Pittsburgh. How well does
Pittsburgh support the Pirates, and
would they support the Pens if they
weren’t doing so well? I doubt it.

V Finally, Mike ends his illustrious arti-
cle with how he wants “Greg Lloyd to
hurt Deion bad, really bad.”sThis is
pretty twisted. He is actually rooting
for one man to seriously injure another.
There is no place for that in sports. It
just further illustrates my point about
who has the fans who “suck.”

Courts forget the
children

The recent Pitt News editorial
“Courts forget the kids” should be
commended for addressing the issue of
child abuse and neglect. Unfortunately,
however, both the title and content of
the editorial perpetuate some danger-

ous myths about the child welfare sys-

tem.

As the director of a non-profit orga-
nization that trains community volun-
teers to advocate on behalf of abused
andneglected children (Allegheny
County Court Appointed Special
Advocate Program- CASA) in Juvenile
Court, I can attest that the judges
address the best interests of the chil-
dren each and every day in their deci-

sion making. A child’s welfare is the

primary factor in every decision made
in abuse and neglect cases. Judges
must make decisions, however, often
given limited information and limited
financial resources to address the com-
plicated problems of children and fami-
lies. In addition, they are bound by
decisions _made by the Pennsylvania
Legislature that define the role and
scope of the courts in child/family rela-
tionships.

It is tempting to take bits and pieces

of well-publicized cases and leap to
conclusions regarding “the system” and

the motives of the decision makers in
the system. It is dangerous and irre-
sponsible, however, to state that chil-
dren's rights are ignored. The system,
without doubt, needs to improve out-
comes for children and to concentrate
on finding them loving, safe and per-
manent homes in a timely manner. This
can be done through hard work and
through community education on the
complex issues faced by decision mak-
ers. It cannot be done through casual
observation and limited information.

Mary Jo Meenen
Executive Director, CASA Program

Editor’s Note: The editorial in question
was referring to cases where child cus-

tody was in dispute, not neglect or

abuse cases. We addressed that issue,
in a separate editorial, on Thursday,
November 30, 1995.

Same Sex
Marriages

“Why should a state government care
if a man wants to marry a man or if a
woman wants to marry a woman?”
This was the question posed to the
readers of The Pitt News in the
Opinions section of January 23. Let’s
examine this issue from another per-
spective.

Let’s begin by noting that sexuality is
indeed relational and therefore should

develop out of a close personal com-.

mitment of love and companionship
with another human and not merely
from the biological or psychological
desire for some kind of self-indulgence
or fulfillment. God has presented us,
from the outset of canonical testa-
ments, with a model for this relational
interaction in the creation epic posited
in Genesis, whereby God created
humans as male and female to be com-
panions to one another. This would
seem to be the natural, perhaps even
divine, ordination of sexuality in the
scheme of things. Inarguably, this is the
divine nature of sexuality in the man-
ner of procreation. It is obvious that
God has made it possible for us to
reproduce naturally only through the
biological act of the union of male and
female. This is not to be disputed; it is
natural. I would therefore argue that in
God’s plan for humanity, male and
female were created as companions to
each other and that the union of male
and female exemplifies God’s holy
intentions.

When we look at the reasons for why
the state would want to prohibit the
union of same sex partners in marriage,
the above stated divine argument
would then be coupled with the desire
of the state to promote its societal stan-
dards, which are often codified. The
standard of male/female unions pre-
serves the community and thus ensures
societal longevity through the act of
procreation. While individuals may be
permitted to deviate from the societal
norm of male/female union and seek
same-sex companionship, it is still in
the community’s best interest to pro-
mote the union whereby childbirth is
the result. This is not a biblical or
divine notion. This is simply a matter
of survival for the community.

In addition, the promotion of com-
munal survival, the norrn of heterosex-

ual marriage, also seems to be the best
means by which to provide a frame-
work in which the children of these
unions can be reared, ideally, in an
atmosphere of love, support and securi-
ty. The Christian and societal standards
therefore look to the norm of marriage
in this respect as a response to the need
for a structured community whereby
the young can be nurtured most appro-
priately and can grow up with their
own responsible sense of sexuality.
This does not say that homosexual par-
ents cannot provide a nurturing atmos-
phere for children, but in today’s soci-
ety the rearing of children in a hetero-
sexual union is to be promoted as the
best means by which to raise children
in order to promote a healthy and
viable community.

Until there is more definitive evi-
dence that homosexuality is a biologi-
cal result of nature, I’ll have to argue
that it still is a product of nurturance,
and therefore society (or the state in
this instance) has the right to establish
laws prohibiting acts which threaten to
diminish the vitality of the community.
There is no reason why the state should
not promote its general welfare through
the encouragement of acceptable
behaviors and the prevention of those
which are harmful.

Missing Media

How refreshing to return to campus
and the fact-free editorializing of The
Pitt News.’ Let me correct, if you will, a
few more of your obvious recent
errors, contained in your editorial of 11
January on the “Case of the Missing
Media.”

You allege that “the overwhelming
bias of the liberal media” inhibits
reporting on the Clintons, whom you
accuse “of far more [skullduggery]

than Nixon ever thought of doing.” I’m’

curious. Our major news -outlets are
owned by multi-million? dollar corpora-
tions (such as General Electric, owner
of NBC, the home of that noted “red,”
Tom Brokaw); why do they permit
this? Marx did assert that capitalism

would create its own gravediggers; I_

doubt if he expected them to spring
from executive suites and boards of
directors.

On the substance of the
Whitewater/Travelgate “scandal,” do
you really believe that it bears serious
comparison to Watergate? President
Nixon used the apparatus of the White
House to spy on his political oppo-
nents, raised illegal funds to finance it,
and then used the resources of the CIA
and FBI to attempt to cover up the mat-
ter. The scandal posed a serious threat
to such democracy as we presently
enjoy, and warranted Nixon’s impeach-
ment. IF the allegations against Mrs.
Clinton are substantiated, it is a com-
paratively trivial matter of inﬂuence
peddling and cronyism; unsavory, but
hardly agthreat to the Republic. The
only concrete “proof” of Mrs. Clinton’s
involvement in these matters comes
from convicted felons (Mr.

, McDouga1l) or White House operatives

with dirty hands (Mr. Watkins, dis-
charged for abusing White House heli-
copters. His draft memo was composed
well after the facts it purports to relate;
an attempt to lessen his own culpabili-
ty, perhaps?) I would note that the main
accuser, Sen. Alfonse D’Amato, is
hardly a paragon of political virtue. His
own brother was convicted of influ-
ence-peddling (i.e. access to the
Senator) but he luckily escaped censure
by that noted bastion of politicalpro—
bity, the supine Senate Ethics
Committee.

Should The Pitt News wish to lament
an overlooked scandal, let me suggest
Iran/Contra. President Reagan and his
cronies violated both domestic and
international law in their obsessive pur-
suit of the overthrow of the
Sandinistas. Their efforts resulted in a
judgement in Nicaragua’s favor by the
World Court; would that our own jus-
tice system were so capable.
Impeachment of President Reagan was
considered too traumatic, though
Reagan’s irregularities were of far
greater scope than Nixon’s. Our own
pundits and politicians — Democrats
as well as Republicans — shufﬂed the
matter off the political stage. They
feared that the constitutional crisis
impeachment would produce might
justly undermine confidence in our
political institutions.

And what of The Pitt News’ own
bias? Inoted recently a glowing profile
of the campus Republican leader; what
about the Democrats, or even the
Young Socialists? You have abundant

With a possible $3 million

During Sunday’s 27-17
loss to the,Dal1as Cowboys
in Super Bowl XXX, the
Steeler offensive line was
very offensive.

In the opening moments,
as the Cowboys exploded

the Steelers blocking unit
failed to get the offense
going.

It was evident that
Pittsburgh thought they
could run against the
Cowboy defense. But the
line failed to get any holes
for starting running back p
Erric Pegram. Pegram car-
ried the ball six times for a
measly 15 yards.

The inability to get the
running game going early
is what forced O’Donnell
to attempt 49 passes. For
the game the Steelers
rushed 31 times for 103
yards, a pathetic 3.3 yards

No. 3 UConn crushes Lady Panthers

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

In three minutes this past Saturday, the
Pitt Lady Panthers learned why the
Connecticut Huskies are the defending
national champions.

Connecticut stormed out to a 8-0 lead
in the first three rriinutes, setting the tone
for a 91-52 demolition of the Lady
Panther defense.

The four buckets came from Kara
Wolters and Nykesha Sales, who
accounted for a combined 39 points for
the afternoon. The first eight points,
including Sales’ reverse layup at the
17:00 mark, sent Panther Coach Kirk
Bruce scrambling for a 20—second time-
out.

“We just told them to relax and
approach it like a shootaround,” said
Bruce, whose team had trouble from the
ﬂoor the entire contest.

Latia Howard scored Pitt’s ﬁrst bucket
after the timeout to stop the onslaught,
but Connecticut quickly rebounded,
building up a 30-6 lead before the
halfway point of the first period.
Wholesale substitutions and the
Panthers’ 19 percent shooting slowed the
scoring and gave UConn a 45-19 edge at
the break. ’

“We were shooting some misguided
missiles,” said Bruce of the team’s trou-
bles. .

Bruce blamed part of the first half on
the full house at Connecticut’s Harry A.
Gampel Pavilion — the largest crowd
Pitt hasplayed in front of since the City
Game’ versus Duquesne. _ - 1

‘Sales: scored three of her 26 points to
start the second half, taking a pass from
Jennifer Rizzotti and draining a shot
from beyond the arc. Pitt’s Stephanie
Petho answered with a jumper and Latia
Howard made a foul shot to cut the lead

back to 26, but an 18-0 blitz by the
Huskies put the game far out of reach.
Bruce called another timeout to slow
the action, but it couldn’t change the out-
come. The Lady Panthers came within
40 points only twice the rest of the con-

‘ test, with UConn opening the lead as

wide as 46 late in the second half. A last-
second shot by Pitt’s Jamie Warren
brought the deficit down to 39 at the
buzzer.

As if the score doesn’t tell the story
well enough, Connecticut extended their
domination of the Panthers to the stat
sheet. Pitt shot just under 31 percent for
the contest, compared with UConn’s 49
percent clip. Connecticut registered 58
rebounds, scored 20 points on the fast
break, and outscored Pitt in the paint 56-
14.

“It’s really difficult as a coach because
you can’t do much,” said Bruce. “Any
time we play UConn is a challenge.”

Pitt Junior LaTonya Durham, a reserve
who saw 22 minutes of playing time in
the loss, led all Lady Panthers with 12
points. Petho "and junior Melissa
Thompson each registered eight for Pitt.

Starters J oJ 0 Guzman and Tressa Bolferti
' were shut out for the afternoon, while

Howard was held to six points, going 2-
11 from the ﬂoor.

“She’s our toughest player,” said
Bruce of Howard, last week’s Big East
Player of the Week. “They went right
after her.” ‘ ‘

4 The Lady Panthers come back home
for their next contest, facing new Big
East member West Virginia this

. Wednesday at Fitzgerald Field House.

The Mountaineers return four starters
from last year’s 8-20 campaign in the
Atlantic 10 Conference. Earlier this sea-

Wrestling rests sfcirfers, beats Cleveland 31‘.

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

With just three days of rest after the gruel-V 3

ing National Duals in Nebraska, several of
Pitt’s top wrestlers,vincluding seniors Brett
Gould and J.J. Fasnacht, sat out last
Wednesday's meet at Cleveland State
University.

It didn’t matter. Pitt manhandled the
Vikings 23-10.

“They’re a mediocre team,” Head Coach A

Rande Stottlemyer said. “But going into

their gym with a lot of inexperience, we

didn’t have the greatest matchups.”

And there are also the inevitable emotion-
al letdowns after a major event. 

“National Duals was a great event. It’s
deﬁnitely a step down to go to Cleveland
State,” Stottlemyer said. “You’re going to
be at a different level.” V

Early on, the Panthers seemed to be on '

that different level. At 118 pounds, Nelson
Cope gave Cleveland State a 3-0 lead with a
5-3 overtime victory over Pitt’s Chris
Stevens. Mike Ziska, the Panthers’ 126
pounder, returned the favor with a 6-5 over-
time decision over Matt Grucella. Ziska has

been the leader of a freshman class with ,

which Stottlemyer is impressed.

“Ziska continues to do a good job. Joel
Giroski has struggled, but he’s holding his
own for a freshman. And Jacob Schaus has
done a nice job too,” Stottlemyer said.

Pitt’s John Richey scored a 12-4 major
decision over Mike Naugle to put the

Panthers up 7-3, their first lead of the night. -

The lead vanished just as easily. »

With Fasnacht out, freshman Josh
Drewitz was called upon to face Cleveland
State’s Brandon Gibbs. The bout was the
ﬁrst of the season for Drewitz, and the inex-
perience showed. Gibbs won handily, a '10-
1 major decision to even the team score at
7. . ,

After splitting those first_four matches,
Pitt never lost the lead again, winning ﬁve

of the remaining six bouts. Brian Pardini -

began the Panthers’ onslaught with a 4-2
decision over CSU’s Jerome Jones.
“Pardini’s done a nice job lately. He
could’ve won a couple matches at National
Duals,” Stottlemyer said. “He beat a better
kid at Cleveland than the one he lost to

against Michigan State [at National Duals].”

Two of the core of impressive freshmen
were up next to try to shore up the 158 and
167-pound classes. At National Duals, Pitt

Caplan (21.92).

With the Big East Championships less than a month away, the Pitt men’s
swim team beat up on Villanova University, 178-64, and the women lost to the
reigning champs, 123-120, by a touch out in the final event.

The 400-meter freestyle relay team of Melissa Burns, Irene Stergios, Alicia
Tymes and Isabel Dejo lost by .27 of a second, which made the difference in

“That last relay team did an excellent job,” said Coach Marian Keen. “That
was a very exciting finish to an exciting meet. We ended up on the short end
again, but I think this was a great boost to our confidence. It opened
Villanova’s and the rest of the Big East’s eyes that we are an up-and-coming

Both teams started slowly by taking second in the opening event, the 400- -

From that point on, the men never took a breath, winning the next 11 of 12
events. Freshman Bret Collins won by more than 15 seconds in the 1,000 free
(9:50.09) and Eric Stefanski placed second (l0:05.58). Next, senior captain
Sami Vartianen started a 1-2-3 sweep in the 200 free (1143.74) and Preston
Hamontree (1:44.0) and Adam Kotkiewicz (1:44.37) finished it. Pitt swept
again in the 50 free with Eric Stoll (21.24), Bob Nooning (21.71) and" Noah

After the 50 free, Pitt had a tremendous lead and wins by Mike Tortorici in
the 200-meter individual medley (1:57 .27), Eric Stull in the 100 free (46.76),
-Adam Kotkiewicz in the 200-meter backstroke (1253.46), Pete Hezky in the
500 free (4:44.01), and Hakan Kiper in the 200-meter breaststroke (2:08.09)

Senior Jeremy McClean
came one step closer to his
goal of qualifying for NCAA
finals when he won the
men’s three-meter diving
competition against the
Villanova Wildcats at Trees
Pool. McClean finished

with 328.50, 8.63 points
ahead of junior John
Soulakis, 319.87.

“I beat John'all the time,”
McClean joked.

- Soulakis won the one-
meter event 344.70.

“I’m happy,” Soulakis
said. “It was atough week of
practice.”

“We always root for each

finish strong against‘ Villanova

other when we go to the Big
East,” McClean said. “We
want to be beat Miami.”
McClean finished second

credit, they did wear down
the Cowboy defense. By
the fourth quarter Bam
Morris was exposing some
large holes, but how much
of that can be attributed to
the Cowboys playing a
zone defense? Most of
Bam’s big runs were on
draw plays.

Pittsburgh needs to go
out and find one of those
mammoth, yet lightning-
quick, linemen that are
not afraid to do things
like chop block and hit
defenders while they are
down.

See, the problem is that
the Steelers aren’t dirty
enough. It’s not the nice
guys who finish first, it’s
the guys who can cheat .
while getting away with it
that do.

- The Cowboys offensive
line knows how to cheat.
Super-fat Eric Williams
doesn’t rely on his own
skills, of which he is
reported to have plenty.

All season, Williams
whined and denied any
allegations about being a
dirty player. But he IS a
dirty player, and so are
some of his linemates. The
name Larry Allen comes to
mind.

hada combined 1-5 record in the two divisions. At 158
pounds, redshirt freshman Jacob Schaus added to Pitt’s
lead with a 4-2 decision over Brian Sashko. At 167
pounds, Joel Giroski lost a nail—biter, dropping a 3-2
decision to CSU’s James Farley.

Pitt’s Bryan Matusic broke out of a slump at 177
pounds. After going 0-3 at National Duals, Matusic
won a 12-3 major decision against Cleveland State’s
Craig Wise. Despite the impressive showing,
Stottlemyer. wants to move Matusic down to the 167-

' one of these guys.

Imagine this: O’Donnell
hands the ball off to
Morris, who starts running
around the left corner. On
the right side of the line,
Williams delivers a devas-
tating chop-block to
Buffalo Bill defensive end
Bruce Smith, taking him
out of the play.

But Smith has his right
ACL torn to pieces. The
refs didn’t catch the block
because of Williams’ mas-
tery of cheating.

Or how about this: try
and woo Raiders offensive
line coach Joe Bugel to
come to Pittsburgh. Much
was documented this sea-
son of the dirty tactics he
taught his linemen.

Hey, but that’s alright.
Bugel was rewarded with a
$700,000 contract after the
season, the highest ever
for an assistant coach in
the NFL.

Pittsburgh needs to make
a dedication to win at
whatever costs. Chop-
blocking teams like the
Cowboys and 49ers con-
tend for the Super Bowl
year after year.

They may take some
media ﬂak for changed
tactics, but everybody
would love them if they
won the Super Bowl.

Swimming
°From page 8

“I was pleased with the way everyone
swam,” said Coach Chuck Knoles.
“Hamontree had a phenomenal meet
with some season bests and Eric Stull
had a lifetime best in the 50 free. We
expected to dominate because Villanova
doesn’t have scholarships.”

The women came back from the open-
ing relay loss to sweep the 1,000 free
with Samantha Chabotar winning
(l0:l4.l5), Megan McNallen second
(l0:35.08) and Lindsay Swiderski third
(10:46.6l).

From then on, swims by Melissa
Burns, who placed second in the 200
free (l:55.08), and Jill Fletcher, who fin-
ished first in the 200 breast (2:24.08),
helped keep Pitt in the meet.

Also the trio of Irene Stergios
(2:08.00), Jenny Dorah (2:08.26) and
Jenny Banks (2:09.66) finished 2-3-4 in
the 200 ﬂy to make sure the meet would
go down until the final event.

“Burns was not afraid to go out and
race,” said Keen. “In the 200 fly all
three girls went out and took charge of
the race and that’s what I want.”

The teams host Duquesne on February
10th and then the Big East
Championships starting on February
22nd.

“I’m very pleased with where this

team has had the most in season success
since I’ve been here. Right now we are
swimming faster than anyone in the
league. If we swim the way I know we
can, we will do well in the Big East.”

“In a three day meet like the Big East
anything can happen,” said Keen. “We
