Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s
cavalier attitude is troubling the state Senate
Appropriations Committee, according to
state Sen. Tim Schaffer.

“As a representative of the taxpayers, I
was very taken back by the arbitrariness of
O’Connor and his senior staff, [who] made
no apologies [for their excessive
spendingl,” Schaffer said.

Schaffer added that O’Connor told the
committee at the annual appropriations
hearings in Harrisburg yesterday that all
spending since he has entered office has
been justified

“O’Connor and his senior staff cannot
see the error of their ways,” Schaffer said.

At the hearing O’Connor presented
changes made to a budget proposal
presented to the state in September. Among
the changes, O’Connor asked for a 4-

original proposal sought a 10-percent

Association
says medical
incident was

race-based
By Julie Sabol

Asst. News Editor

An African—American Pitt medical
student attending class at the Center
for Emergency Medicine in Oakland
was the target of racial discrimination
lastTuesday, according to The Student
National Medical Association.

A press release from SNMA said an
Africa n—American medical student was
reporting for class and asked a
secretary for the location of the nearest
men’s room. Upon leaving the
restroom, the secretary asked the
student to leave the building.

“For no reason she asked him to
leave," Seth Borquaye, president of
SNMA said.

According to the release, the student
explained that he was a medical
student and showed his identiﬁcation,
but the secretary demanded that he

I leave the building.

The woman called security and
also enlisted the support of a
physician. Another medical student
who witnessed the incident confirmed
the student’s identity, but to no avail‘.
The physician then tried to forcibly
remove the student from the building.
However when security arrived, the
secretary left and the physician
realized that thestudent was in fact a
medical student, according to SNMA.

The SNMA has called a press
conference to be held tonight in
Dining Room A of the William Pitt
Union at 5:30 p.m. It will be an open
forum to discuss the issues of racial
injustice and the need for changes
that will benefit both current and
future students. All of the details
surrounding the incident will be
revealed at this time.

of the racism everywhere. We want
the university to be aware they are

Ten months after allegations of mismanagement of federal

According to Auditor General Barbara Hafer’s office, the final
review of the eight-month study of Pitt’s books was prepared on

Last June, Hafer announced that she was gathering a five-

finances].” Hafer said that for the first time the audit would
analyze salary and retirement packages.

initiating the probe. Marous said he had sent an audit request to

Although women have played
a dominant role in the political
struggles of South Africa, the
feminist movement has thus far
been unsuccessful, according to
Mercia Andrews, a South African
activist who spoke at Pitt
yesterday. ,

Andrews, who has been
imprisoned several times for her
opposition to apartheid, attributed
the unsuccessful feminist
movement to the lack of
autonomy within the movement.

“The women’s movement in

organized along political lines.”

She added that the dominant
organization, the Women’s
League, is too conservative on
the important issues.

“Hundreds of women die from
backstreet abortions daily,”
Andrews said, “and not one
political organization — not one
women’s organization — will
raise the issue of the right for
women to control their own
bodies.”

She said that in South African
culture, large families are seen as
a sign of virility, and therefore the

abortion.

Women’s organizations are also
trying to do away with a traditional
law that requires men to negotiate
with their brides’ families before
getting married, Andrews said.

“The women today are taking
the view that they aren't cattle to
be sold,” she said. “It also
discriminates against working-
class men who cannot afford to
pay.  But women in the women’s
leagues are saying that we cannot
attack this law because it is a

traditional law that must be dealt

Student film festival

showcases amateurs

By Annette Romeo
For T be Pm News

Don't expect hours of Moe,
Curly and Larry at the University
of Pittsburgh’s first-ever Student
.Film Festival.

Plans for a two-hour film festival
on March 19 in the William Pitt
Union, sponsored by Students
for Media and Art Exhibition, will
showcase various films and videos
created by undergraduate student
amateurs and film majors.

Brian Wittle, president of
Students for Media and Art
Exhibition, helped organize the
group with the intent to start a
student-run television station on
campus. Wittle said the original
members realized that there were
other forms of media exhibition
and decided to plan art and film
exhibitions. 'l'he exhibitions will
be run by students and shown by
students every semester.

Wittle, who is also the current
news director of WPTS-FM, said
he expects 25-30 entries in the
film festival and said that most
films are short, ranging from three
to 10 minutes.

Because film production classes
are not offered directly at Pitt,
students interested in film
production must transfer credits
from Pittsburgh Filmmakers.

According to Susan Kachinski
of Pittsburgh Filmmakers, most
student films are not shown in
traditional movie theaters, but
are art films that are shown in

museums, film festivals and

independent film houses, like the
downtown Fulton Theater.
Kachinski said most students
develop a love of the medium
and go on as independent artists
with their own vision. Some may
make it commercially, but that is
not the sole purpose of being in
film, she said.

Alcohol raises estrogen
levels after menopause

By Cassie Smith
For The Pitt News

9 One Pitt researcher’s work shows that post-menopausal
women are able to raise their estrogen levels by consuming
alcohol.

According to Dr. Judith Gavaler, research shows that there is
a statistically significant increase in the levels of estrogen in the
bodies of post-menopausal women who consume three to six
drinks a week. For this research, a drink was equivalent to one
beer, one glass of wine or one highball of liquor. Estrogen levels
were found to rise when three to six drinks per week were
consumed. However there was no more benefit in consuming
additional alcohol. Higher levels of estrogen help reduce some
of the aftereffects of menopause.

Gavaler, whose work was funded by grants from the National
institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol, stressed that these
findings relate solely to post-menopausal women.

Another issue raised by Gavaler was the publishing and
reporting of beneficial findings related to alcohol.

“So many lives have been ruined by alcohol abuse that when
researchers in the ﬁeld find something that may actually be
beneficial related to alcohol consumption, there is some
hesitancy [in reporting those findingsl.”

Wurningfor Michelangelo
computer virus dispatched

By Christine Hanna

News Assistant

The deadly computer virus Michelangelo is triggered to
activate on March 6, the birthday of the Italian Renaissance
painter.

Michelangelo destroys all data on a computer’s hard drive
and has been spread by ﬂoppy disks to MS-DOS—based
personal computers throughout the world. —

“Once your personal computer is infected, every floppy disk
one uses will be infected automatically by the virus. It also
corrupts the root directories of floppy disks it infects, so you can
lose access to your files,” a press release issued by Symantec
company said.

Symptoms of Michelangelo can include a reduction in free/
total memory by 2,048 bytes, and some floppy disks become
unusable or display odd graphic characters during ‘DIR’
commands. Some integrity-management products will report
that the master boot record has been altered.

According to Pitt’s Technical Support Supervisorjay Graham,
‘there have been no reports of the virus on campus.

Computer and Information Systems Director David Schatz
said he is fairly certain the virus cannot get into the campus’
public computer labs, but he is not sure how the virus is written.

“We have taken extreme measures so that DOS computers in
campus labs are not affected,” Graham said.

Schatz said the scanning test and setting the computers’
clocks ahead have shown that every machine is clean in the
public labs, but he cannot speak for other departmental
computer labs.

Philosophy club looms gays, lesbians

By Heather York
Staff Writer

It was not a bashing of the
politically correct movement. It
was not a symbolic protest against
Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s recent refusal to
remove the ROTC program from
campus. Pitt’s philosophy club
simply decided to ban all
bisexuals, gays and lesbians from
its organization.

“This is the real McCoy,” David
Snyder, vice president of Pitt’s
philosophy club, said. “The
question is not, ‘Why did we
decide to expel queers?’ The
question is, ‘Why not?"’

The expulsion was sparked by
O’Connor’s decision not to
remove Pitt’s ROTC program from
campus despite the fact that the
Department of Defense’s policy,
which bans bisexuals, gays and
lesbians, conﬂicts with Pitt’s anti-
discrimination policy.

O’Connor’s recent actions did
not cause the the philosophy
club’s decision, Snyder said.

Rather they were catalysts.

“The problem before was that
we couldn't distance ourselves
for fear of coming up against
university policy,” Doug Eyer,
president ofthe club,.said. “Now
O’Connor has given us the
chance.”

“Political correctness and
cultural diversity are now taken
for granted," Snyder said.
“Unfortunately, the whole
mentality fails to acknowledge
people with other opinions. Don’t
tell me that there aren’t people
who are uncomfortable around
gay people.”

But the reason for the expulsion
was not discomfort, according to
Snyder. ltwas something difficult
to define, Snyder said.

“Here’s the thing. To be gay
now is to be militant. [Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance] is
militant, and that’s fine. But
philosophy has a different agenda.
It’s intellectual, and I’m not saying
gays aren’t intellectual. Homo-
sexuals bring their agendas to the
meeting, which fosters an

 3

environment not conducive to
the agenda of the club,” Snyder
said.

Linda Jarrett, a member of
BiGALA, said the organization is
far from militant. “We serve
educationally, as a support group
and politically, but the type of
politics is not militant."

Gay activism doesn't embody
the ideals of rational discourse
and logical thinking, Eyer said.
He used the debate over AIDS
treatment as an example. Many
gay-rights people are pushing
the medical community to make
experimental drugs more

accessible. But Eyer said there is’ i

a certain rational process
necessary for scientific
experimentation.

“This is just one example of the
way politics can harm rational
thought,” he said.

‘‘I don’t understand the point
of a philosophy club when they
only believe in experimental
paradigm,”Jarrett said. “They are
disregarding some major

 the recent men's basketball season jtist.eompleted,’-  " ‘ ~

fairs now begin to look back upon  past year’s

Aside from the games that should have or could have
been won, one topic that continuously comes up for
debate is the fact that Pitt plays two Big East Conference
games (Georgetown and Syracuse) and has its annual
meeting with cross-town rival Duquesne University at the
Civic Arena.

Fans contend that the precious home—court advantage
that every team in college basketball searches for is
lessened when games are moved to the Civic Arena. In
addition, the games are moved off-campus and away
from easy student access.

The athletic department has defended this policy with
numerous reasons. One of them is the fact that the waiting
list for season tickets to Fitzgerald Field House is up to
1,500 people.

The Civic Arena, which holds 16,000+, gives these
people a chance to see a couple of games in a
season.

Additional student tickets are provided as well, allowing
more students to see the marquee games.

However a more important reason for moving these
games exists: money. According to Pitt Athletic Director
Oval Jaynes, each game that Pitt plays in the Civic Arena
nets $90,000 more than games played at Fitzgerald‘ Field
House.

Under the current plan of two games a year —— plus the
Duq_uesne game, which must be played at the Arena —
the athletic department gains upward of an extra $270,000
a year.

If used properly, this money could be used to strengthen
the entire Pitt athletic program. One game could provide
the funds for almost two full student-athlete scholarships.

Sports like women's basketball, wrestling, soccer, etc.,
can benefit tremendously from the additional inﬂux of
funds.

With new resources, they can possibly even bring in
recruits that a lack of funds would have precluded.

Plans have been made for Pitt to play such nationally
recognized programs as North Carolina, Illinois and UCLA
in the next three seasons. These games will draw larger
crowds, meaning more money at the gate. Also, these
contests will probably be televised, increasing the revenue
even more.

The advantages of playing a couple of select games at
the Civic Arena far outweigh the inconveniences they may
cause.

Until demand for a new, on-campus facility becomes
strong enough to draw action from the administration, the
Civic Arena provides the best alternative.

When I think of all of the problems here at Pitt
(and there are many to think about), my thoughts
always seem to come to one conclusion: money.
Not spending, mind you, but the status of the
university as a whole within a financial setting.

I have come to realize that the university is a
business. It is a big business, the Corporation of
Education, wherein we, the “wage earners” — or
rather, “knowledge earners” —— pay for the privilege
of coming here, sign an agreement that we will not

financial one, and, financially, it was a smart
decision.

In another case, take the remodeling of the
chancellor’s ofﬁce. He-has to look ‘presentable for
the clients: The fact is that only the most wealthy or
powerful clients get to see the chancellor. These
clients bring huge amounts of finances into this
corporation, and the chancellor has to look good.
If the chancellor did not look presentable, he might
jeopardize his standing in his clients’ eyes. In the

work for any other corporations »
and, except for the firing and
quitting of students, are basically
locked into our jobs for at least
four years.

Joshua
Silverman

business world, how you look
and come across matters just as
much as the services you can
offer. So financially, in the long
run, the remodeling made sense.

Like employees of a business,
we, as knowledge earners, have mobility: We must
first prove our mettle in lower level positions
before advancing on to higher positions with more
responsibilities. We spend countless hours preparing
reports for the teachers, or “regional bosses,” and
are checked on periodically by department heads.
Our progress is marked and kept up to date by
these regional bosses, and we get worker evaluations
in the form of grades.

The Corporation of Education does have
significant drawbacks. Like a business, our rules,
regulations and policies are handed down from a
Board of Directors. There is no real worker input,
and except for things like excessive spending and
budget cutbacks, workers are left to their own skills
and devices to try to advance. To be able to register
for new positions, we have to wait in long lines and
transgress a great deal of red tape. Because such
rules and regulations are set down from on high,
the workers have to live with them.

Special interest groups, or “unions,” in the
Corporation of Education, although appreciated
within the corporation, are not a factor in financial
decisions. For example, take the recent decision to
allow the ROTC program to remain on campus.
This is not a moral or ethical decision; it is a
financial decision. Put simply, ROTC is a branch of
the military. The military has money to spend on
research, grants, funds, etc. So therefore ROTC is
bringing in cash.

Without financial gain, the business will not
prosper. If our Board of Directors were to outlaw
ROTC, all of that money would be gone. The
Department of Defense would simply say, “This
corporation does not represent us well — we will
take our business to another corporation.” The
Corporation of Education would begin to falter,
and either huge “privilege to work” expenses
would be pronounced upon the workers or large
administrative cutbacks would be made. One way
or the other, things would get worse without the
money. So the board simply shrugged the workers’
and unions’ opinion and decided to keep the
money coming in. Morally and ethically, the board
may not believe in the DOD policies, but the
decision was not a moral or ethical one. It was a

  i '..v.‘.*‘.-.‘i',.:.*s ;:V;.,,  c; “ya; ',;_.2,  4,,‘,1l§r’!yI:<'\,T'.'!'Vl,"'l'— . . ..

 

.g..

 

 

Finally, we come to the
decision to have a $92,500 installation of the
chancellor. Right away, people said that this was
excessive spending on the part of the institution.
But look at it from a business point of view. Frankly,
you have to spend money to make money. A few
elements arise when you spend so much money so
quickly and blatantly in a time of economic crisis.
First, you get publicity. I realize that most of the
publicity that the school has been getting in the last
few weeks has been negative, but for a business,
any publicity — especially the free kind, like we
have been getting through the mass media — is
good publicity.

Second, we show people that we are willing to
spend that amount of money. Regardless of the
point, teachers, administrators and other clients of
the business will see that we have resources. We
will pull in the big speakers and teachers. The more
we spend, the more competitive we become.
Finally, our current clients see that we are willing
to go the extra mile for them; you do not spend
those amounts of money on just anyone. Only the
biggest clients and best and brightest of the
Corporation of Education will participate. We will
put on a show.

The implications of this one event will not be
seen for a while. I believe that this spending will
enable us to pull in even more money. That
$92,500, when looked at from a business point of
view, is just a small portion of the vast amount of
money that must be spent.

I do not support excessive spending, especially
in times of economic crisis like we are in now. But
look at what is happening here at Pitt —— the
amounts of press, the great speakers, the grand
regalia. Take all of those factors into consideration.
Frankly, when looked at from the Corporation of
Education's point of view, this stance on finance,
the ambivalent board of directors and the status of
the workers in this community, is probably the best
decision that this corporation has made in a long
time.

Perhaps CEO is a better title for Dr. O’Connor.

Women

Continued from page I
with very carefully.”

Andrews said the question
South African women must ask
themselves is whether they are
going to tackle these crucial
women’s issues confronting them
today or continue to concentrate
on more apolitical issues, such as
sexual freedom.

After an introduction by Pitt
Professor Dennis Brutus, Andrews
traced the history of women’s
involvement in South African
activism. Beginning with a
massive demonstration in 1956,
this history illustrates a pattern of
women fighting and demon-
strating for material and non-
gender issues.

“Right up to today, we have not
had a mass demonstration or
boycott or any other conflict that
was waged particularly around
gender struggles,” she said.

As a result, the position of
women today has not changed
significantly in 50 years, she said.
Certain issues, such as sexual
harassment, have begun to be
recognized, but other problems
have arisen from the increasing
political violence and economic
problems.

“The violence has changed the
form of political organizations to
defense committees,” she
explained, “and the nature of
defense committees [implies] that
they are made up mainly of men.”

Furthermore, the massive
unemployment draws rural
women to the cities, where they

are still unable to support,

themselves, Andrews said. most
South African women find
themselves outside the economic
mainstream and begin to support
themselves in illegal ways, such
as prostitution or selling drugs.

Virus

Continued from page 3

CIS is offering a virus-detection software package available in
Room 204 of the Belleﬁeld Annex and in the computing labs in
Forbes Quad and Benedum Hall. “If [software] is run before
March 6, it will detect and destroy the virus so it will not trigger
on March 6," Graham said.

Graham said CIS has received between 200 and 250 calls
concerning the scanning software.

“We are expecting no incidents on campus. [Michelangelo] is
very rare, but deadly,” Graham said.

To date there have been two reported cases in North America,
but they were detected and removed.

“We are hoping that [the nationwide] number will not grow,”
Graham said.

According to Graham, more will be known about the virus
after March 6 because the hard drives infected will be blown
away. .

“Yes, [the virus] is out there. I do not think it will bring the
computer world to its knees. It is not as wide-spread or
catastrophic as the media is making it out to be,” Schatz said.

Michelangelo was detected in April 1991 in Sweden and the
Netherlands. “It is closely related to the Stoned Virus, but very
different in what it does,” Graham said.

philosophical discussions about

experimental medicine.”

Snyder insisted the club’s
reasoning was legitimate, but Eyer
admitted it may be stupid.

“But there are a lot of stupid
laws that people live with. Why
shouldn't we do this?” Eyer asked.

Snyder said he thinks the
philosophy club has started
something other clubs may want
to do. Tonight the pre—law society,
of which Snyder is president, will
also expel its homosexuals.

“This is nothing like the Pitt
Students for Peace protest,"
Snyder insisted. “They kicked out
a member. It was in the paper.
Then he was protesting the
installation a week later. He wasn't
kicked out! This is the real lthingl!”

“If they want a philosophy club,
let them have their own,” he said.

not isolated from it. Racism is
everywhere, and Pitt is no
exception,” Borquaye said.

Copies of the report were sent
to Pitt officials, including
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
and Vice President of Student
Affairs William Harmon.

“I’m not quite sure what all
happened. The statement itself
seemed a little vague,” Harmon
said.

But he said he is planning to
attend the press conference to
learn the details.

“As an institution of higher
learning, we should be more
sensitive to these issues and try to
change them,” Borquaye said.

Budget  

Continued from page 1

Starke said Gov. Robert Casey
estimated that PennSy1vania’s
revenue will fall $325 million

- short of last year.

If the governor’s estimates are
correct, statewide budget cuts
are inevitable.

Starke said it is impossible to
say how much money Pitt will
receive next year since most of
the state revenue is paid in the

form of income tax at the end of A

Apnl
“If the governor’s estimates are
. right,- then Pitt will get what.[Ca-seyl
recommended,” Starke said, but
‘he added that during the month
I-of Febru-arytihe state did garner
:51‘-ightly mo-re-rev‘enue than
‘estimated.

said.

learned of it when she decided to
start the audit.

Marous and Hafer said that
ever since revelations of
questionable spending practices
surfaced at Pitt, a study of state
funds was needed. ~

A federal audit that found
misspent research funds sparked
disclosures of information about
former Pitt President Wesley
Posvar’s retirement package and
a loan plan for top university
administrators.

Pitt spokesperson Bob Reteshka
said Pitt has seen preliminary
copies of the audit but is unable
to comment until it reviews the
final draft.

Throughout the audit, Hafer
had been openly critical of Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s
opposition to State Rep. Ron
Cowell’s “right to know” bill,
which would open Pitt’s financial
records to the public.

She accused O’Connor of
making her job more difficult by
his apparent switch in position.
O’Connor said he opposed the
legislation because he believes it
may jeopardize research projects
at the university.

Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

City Theater’s current production of
Miss Evers’ Boys tells a dark story with
honesty and heart. Set against the backdrop
of a 19303 government study on the effects
of untreated syphilis in black men, the
play focuses on four of the study’s unwilling
participants living in Tuskegee, Ala., and
the nurse responsible for their care, Miss
Eunice Evers.

Miss Evers is superbly played by Monica
C. Farrell. Tying the play together as both
the narrator and a central figure", Farrell

‘ plays Evers with a mix ofstrength, humor

and tenderness that is always right on
target.

She powerfully portrays the inner
conflicts of a _woman dedicated to healing
but who is suddenly forced to document
destruction, particularly’ in her final
monologue. She is one of the best actors
in a show filled with good things.

The men in Miss Evers’ care are played
equally well. As friends, they compete as
a team in folk—dancing competitions, calling
their group “Miss'Evers’ Boys.” They are
all bound together by their participation in
the Tuskegee study, which they believe is
a treatment for their disease. Distrustful of
the government, they accept the different
“treatments” and procedures, including

A mercury rubs and spinal taps, because of

their faith in Evers.

' Jonathan Adams is excellent in the role
of Caleb Humphries. Bitter for a number
of reasons, his character softens and
changes under Miss Evers’ inﬂuence. His
Caleb is often angry but is able to show a
surprisingly vulnerable side as well. One
of the most disturbing scenes in the play
is his, as he receives a spinal tap on stage.
Clutching the table and screaming Bible
verses relevant to oppression, he creates a

Similarly strong are Doug Pona
and Milton E. Thompson Jr. as
Hodman Bryan and Ben
Washington, respectively. Pona is
appropriately superstitious as the
town’s folk healer. Ben Washington,
the “grandpa” of the group, is played
by Thompson with an understated
warmth that is both gentle and
lovable.

The strongest scenes of the play
are those between the men and
Miss Evers. All five actors are masters
of ensemble playing with an
instinctual sense of timing that is
amazing to see. infusing the ﬁrst act
with an infectious sense of joy and
life, their energetic performances
make the second act even more
poignant by comparison.

Tony Ferrieri’s set design and .'
William O’Donnell’s lights help 7

transport the audience to a small
Southern town in the 19305. The
warm earth tones in the set and
lighting cast a golden haze over the
production, creating the effect of a
colorized sepia portrait throughout
the performance.

The Carnegie

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

The festival season is officially
upon us, as the Carnegie Museum
launches two very special
weekend film series. Starting
Friday evening, the first of six
short ﬁlm programs from Latin
America will begin, while
Saturday kicks off the showing of
nine straight Swiss film classics.

Let’s start south of the border,

where American political policies -

have ravaged the region but have
also inspired some classic
narratives and documentaries. Six
years in themaking, the shorts
are grounded in themes. A host
of countries are represented
during the six programs,
including Mexico, Bolivia, Peru
and even Cuba, the only
Caribbean nation in the show.
The shorts were recently shown
at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York, where praise was
given for their political punch.
Non—fiction works, such as Jorge
Ruiz’s 1953 Come Back
Sehastiana, heralded respect for
its historical ‘sense, and
Colombian Gabriela Samper’s The
Most Holy Brotherhood garnered

. support for its subject matter.

This 12-minute piece borders on
the modern and the medieval
with it’s haunting portrait of an
eccentric religious sect and its
leader.

Another interesting piece,

Bielich said. “We get away with
more because people don't expect
as much, but we do get respect as
musicians. Female bands,
especially in the underground
scene, must be better than the
crowd's expectations to overcome
stereotypes,” Bielich said,
describing the sort of difficulties
the all—female band deals with.
Mythic definitely breaks the
female stereotype, as it will be
playing in the Pittsburgh “mini-

Lounge in Oakland. The fest
includes Earache recording artist
Massacre and Century Media artist,
Grave, which hails from Sweden.
Also appearing are Embalmer

Baphomet from Buffalo,
Johnstown’s own Gehenna and
locals Shroud and Bathym.

“We have this opportunity to

brutal bands, including Massacre,

THE PITT NEWS BIG EAST ISSUE

By Derek Willis
Sports Editor

So what do we have in the Big East this
year? As usual, there are many surprises
and lots of points to discuss. So let’s begin
with the idea that has been tossed around
all year: parity.

It's funny how this one word can be the
topic of such debate. Yet there are some
who persist in saying that the Big East is
not having an “up” year and others who
claim that the conference is as strong as
ever

The way I see it, the Big East is definitely
improving, and there is no distinguishable
lack of talent anywhere except perhaps
Miami. Where last year the league had
marquee players Billy Owens, Eric
Murdock and Dikembe Mutombo, this
season has featured Malik Sealy, Chris
Smith and Alonzo Mourning.

In general, the teams have been tougher
this year. The top five teams are extremely
close in terms of ability. The reason for
these results is not a lack of talent, but
rather a diversity of playing styles.

Georgetown features an offense which
no one thought could get uglier than it has
been in the past, but it has. However the
traditionally strong Hoya defense has again
given the team a distinct advantage over
almost all the other teams because of
Alonzo Mourning.

At St. ]ohn’s the sleek Sealy is the
mainstay of an equally sleek offense. The
closest thing to a pro-style offense in the
conference, the Redmen have the capacity
to run teams off the court with amazing
quickness. (The Connecticut game at
Madison Square Garden is just one example
of this.)

The other teams are different in style,

on for Big East basketball

also. Note the use of the three—pointer at
Syracuse, the pressure defense of
Connecticut and the effective three-guard
offense at Boston College. With all these
combinations, there are bound to be more
than a few surprises during the regular
season. Some days, some teams just have
their way with others.

Another reason the conference has been
so upside-down occasionally is the
inexperience and inconsistency of many
of its teams. There are veteran teams, but
some of the “veterans” of these clubs have
just assumed the mantle of leadership this
season. This is true of Seton Hall (Terry
Dehere), Syracuse (Adrian Autry and Dave
Johnson) and especially Boston College
(four sophomore starters).

The Big East has reaped the benefits of
having outstanding young talent this year.
While the nation justifiably focuses on the
Fab Five of Michigan, the Big East has its
share of promising newcomers, too.

The list starts with two forwards:
Lawrence Moten of Syracuse and Michael
Smith of Providence. Either one could be
Newcomer of the Year. Moten was an
absolute astonishment at the start of the
year, and he has kept up his high level of
play throughout the season. Smith, after
sitting out a year because of Proposition
42, has improved his game each night and
is one of the league’s best rebounders, bar
none. -

Other players who are candidates for
the All—Rookie team; Donyell Marshall of
Connecticut, Irvin Church from
Georgetown, Miami’s Ochiel Swaby and
Pitt’s Eric Mobley, Orlando Antigua and
Jerry McCullough.

The Big East is moving away from a
great-player league to a great—team league.

Coming off of their biggest
upset of the year, the Pitt Lady
Panthers travel to Storrs, Conn.,
this weekend for the Big East
Conference women’s basketball
championships at the University
of Connecticut.

Saturday, the Lady Panthers

A came from 17 points behind to

defeat the Georgetown Hoyas,
70-67. The Hoyas were this
season’s surprise team. They had
never finished higher than
seventh in the conference
standings and had not had a
winning season since joining the
Big East. This year Georgetown
entered its game against Pitt
looking to gather its 20th win of
the year.

According to Pitt’s head coach

Kirk Bruce, his team could not
have ended an otherwise rocky
season in a better fashion.
“Anytime you go in with a win
over a team that has been No. 2
in the standings all year long and

looking for their 20th [victory], ‘

you have to feel pretty good,”
Bruce said.

However the Lady Panthers
must now focus their attention
on another opponent — the
Boston College Eagles. In the
two games the squads played
against each other this season,
Pitt won at Boston College and
the Eagles won at Pittsburgh.

In the first meeting between
the two on Jan. 18, Pitt came
from behind to win by three
points, 65-62. The loss was the
start of a Boston College losing
streak which spanned nine
games. Ironically the Eagles’

&

north for Big East Tournament 2

tailspin ended in their Feb. 20
rematch with the Lady Panthers.
Boston College capitalized on
poor Pitt shooting and
questionable officiating for a 76-
63 victory. ‘
“We had all the capabilities to

beat BC,” Bruce said. “However, ' 

we just had some mistakes and
they made the most of them.”
The Eagles two main weapons
this season have been guards
Sarah Behn and Kelly Curran.
Behn, a junior, toasted the
Panthers for 29 points in the
Eagles’ victory. She has been
doing that against other teams as
well. Behn leads all conference
players in scoring average (26.7
per game) and ranks among the
national leaders as well. Behn
also finished fifth in the
conference‘ in rebounding,

In a _/it of madness, we allowed
some of our writers to ponder the
Big East Tournament, and what
we got was a variety of answers
which obviously don ‘i agree.
Enjoy! ..

The Big East is a toug _

conference to ﬁgure out. In the
preseason rankings, Seton Hall,
Connecticut and St. John's were
all ranked in the top 25 with
Georgetown and Syracuse
conspicuously missing. Today, it
is the Hoyas and the Orangemen
giving respectability to the league,
while the preseason favorites have
struggled to hang in the rankings.
No less than six teams have
held the top spot, as they claw for
NCAA Tournament bids. It is this
balance of power that makes
predicting the Big East
Tournament so difficult, but here
it goes.
Connecticut

has been

inconsistent all year. Senior Chris
Smith, who will be a lottery pick
in the draft, looks unstoppable
one night and invisible the next.
When he plays well, he brings
out the best in his young
teammates. UConn lacks a
dominating big man, but the
depth of its frontcourt and the
experience of Smith, Rod Sellers,
Scotty Burrell will carry it to a Big
East championship ahead of St.
John’s.

If you have seen the Redmen
on television within the last two
weeks, you might have noticed
that ugly, hybrid, lime-turquoise
green sweater that Looie
Carnesecca has been wearing.
Ugly or not, that means St. _Iohn’s
is winning.

The team has rallied behind
Malik Sealy to take the Big East
regular-season title and has
appeared to peak. T he, return of

If Georgetown were a fairy

himself. If Mourning gets into I

foul trouble, this top 25 team
turns into a pumpkin — and a
rotten pumpkin at that. (Forgive
me for mixing tales.)

The serious contender with the
toughest road in the tourney is
Pitt. It will probably finish in
seventh place and will need to
win four games to win the
championship — not a likely
scenario. If Chris McNeal sticks to
his promise of staying on the
blocks (where he plays best) and
abandons that 15-footjump shot, -
the Panthers will have a serious
chance.

My choices for surprisingly-
quiet exits are Syracuse and‘
Seton Hall The Orangemen have ,

 

many talented individuals, but,
as is their legacy under Boeheim,
they do not play as a team.
Sometimes great talent will win
you a lot of games, but it will not
produce champions. P.}.
Carlesimo, on the other hand, is
the consummate team coach, but
the Hall will make noise in the
NCAAS — not the Big East
tourney.

As much as could be said about
parity, don’t look for Boston
College, Providence or Miami
to scare away the big boys. They
play the role of Big East doormat
too well. The scariest team in the
tourney is Villanova. The
Wildcats are on a roll, and their
shooters are hot. Anyone who
watched their leap-year thrashing
of Pitt knows how dangerous
they can be. Whoever ‘Nova plays
has to be in top form.

above those mundane and all-
too accurate means.

No, the true way to get an
accurate prediction on who’s left
standing Sunday is by conjuring
up asinine and totally biased
excuses for every team’s chances.
Sounds fair, huh! So here goes.

Let’s get the no-doubters out of
the way: Miami, Boston
College and Providence. For
starters, the ‘Canes boast the
league’s ugliest threads (puke
green and orange). To top it off,
this non-revenue-generating team
is anchored by Constantine “Big,
Tall White Guy" Popa (or, to
Miami fans, “Lerch”). The team is
horrendous and ugly. As for B.C.
and the Friars, both are too young
and boring to want to see on
national TV both Saturday and
Sunday.

As for our beloved Pitt
Panthers, forget about it. After
the euphoria of beating Miami on
Thursday night of the tourney for
that magic “18th” win, Pitt will lay
an egg and hit the friendly skies
on Friday. I resisted ousting Pitt
so early because I flat out love
the names Orlando Antigua and
Ahmad Shareef. Say them with
me: Oooorlando Anteeeguail
Ahhhhmad Shareeeeeil! But great
names aside, Pitt won’t see
Saturday.

Two other squads that won’t
enjoy a Saturday brunch on 33rd
and 6th are Villanova and
Syracuse. Why? Simple.
Overrated, annoying coaches
who get more attention than their
underachieving, one—dimensional
teams. Rollie needs a sedative
and a barber, while Boeheim
could go for a personality checkup
to find out if he actually has one.
I just can’t get past these ill feelings
toward the Rollster and }im—bob
to seriously consider either team
for the tourney crown.

As for the Saturday losers, mark
down Georgetown and St.
John’s. Both are riding high atop
the conference as of press time,
occupying a the one and two
positions. My philosophy is this:
Don't bet on the regular-season
champs or hot teams when it
comes to the Big East
Tournament. Why? I don’t know.
It just sounded demonstrative, I
guess. Write it down: ‘Z0 and Co.
and “Silk” Sealy will need a ticket
to see Sunday’s final.

That leaves UConn and Seton
Hall, two teams with respectable

nothing to crack on. Plain and

tourney title, and Terry Dehere
will be Mr. MVP.

- Brian Gallagher

Monday night's’ win over
Georgetown put St. John’s in first
place in the Big East with one
game remaining. If the Redmen
lose their next game, they will fall
back into a tie with the Hoyas.
Seton Hall is also very much
alive, with wins in its last two
games (at Miami and at'St. John's)
giving it the top seed in the
tournament. The conference has
been a confusing mess all season;

why stop now?

This all leads up to settling
things in the Big East Tournament.
In addition to the conference
title, some teams are playing for
their last shot at the NCAA. Pitt is
on the bubble, and so is Boston
College, after it was throttled by
the Panthers Tuesday night.

Villanova and Providence need
to win the whole thing, while
Miami is just looking for its first
season in the conference to
mercifully end.

St.John’s has established itself
as the best team in the conference.
It has the best defense and just
enough offense to get the job
done. Malik Sealy is as good as
any of the main men in the Big
East at crunch time.

Georgetown has stayed near
the top with strong defense, solid
play at the point by Joey Brown
and dominance inside by Alonzo
Mourning. They are vulnerable
to any team that can handle
Mourning inside.

Seton Hall has come on strong
after struggling early. Terry
Dehere can take over late if he
and a solid supporting cast can
keep it close.

Connecticut could still be a
threat. Things have fallen apart
lately, but it is strong inside. Chris
Smith and Scott Burrel make up a
quality backcourt. '

Pitt and Boston College could
also pull off a few upsets. The
Panthers could be a real threat to
the Hoyas. The Panthers are
strong inside and have had
success against Mourning in the
past, especially with power
forward Chris McNeal. Boston
College has a chance in any game
because of its three—point
shooting.

— Ryan Buncber

Ah, yes, the Big East
Tournament. Who can ever tell

about this four—day whirlwind in '

New York? In years past, the
tourney has had its share of
surprises, and this year holds
even more potential.

St. John’s has to be my favorite,
as long as Rob Werdann doesn’t
mess up the chemistry that has
developed in the past month and
a half. The Redmen have the
ability to outlast the various styles
of play they will face from teams
like Villanova or Syracuse.

Count Georgetown, ‘Nova and
Pitt among the teams which could
make a run, if the brackets are
favorable. Syracuse and Seton
Hall don’t appear to be able to
stick around for the semifinals.
Both rely too much on one or
two options, and it will hurt them.

Providence, Boston College and
Miami are the odd teams out in
this scenario, although one of
them might win its first game.
Chances are, however, that none
of them will. The team I haven’t
mentioned is Connecticut. This
team is a bigger mystery than
Notre Dame. Certainly UConn
has the talent and the work ethic
to win this tournament. Butwill it
put it all together in time? I think
so. Players like Chris Smith, Scott
Burrell and Rod Sellers know
what it takes to win the big game,
and Calhoun is a master motivator.
Smith alone is such an outstanding

shooter and leader that UConn
can’t be counted out.

The end result? St. John's will
win it— unless Connecticut does.
Par for the course once again in
Big East basketball.

- Derele Willis

Monday night St. John’s drilled
Georgetown, 65~49, to clinch a
tie for the regular-season Big East
title. These two clubs will meet
again on March 15 to decide the
Big East Tournament.

St. John’s looks more
impressive each time it steps out
on the floor. The Redmen, taking
Malik Sealy’s cue, are playing
with tremendous cohesiveness
right now. They have received
valuable contributions up front
from role players Lamont
Middleton and Mitchell Foster.
Shawnelle Scott is one of the
most-improved players in the

conference. Sealy and company
are champs.

Why beat around the bush? To
beat Georgetown, someone has
to control — not necessarily
contain — Alonzo Mourning.
Easier said than done. Earlier in
conference play it looked simple:
Pack it in, and take cover because
bricks were flying off the rim at
an alarming rate. But the
emergence of forward Robert
Churchwell as a consistent scoring
threat and the even more
surprising spark from rookie
shooting guard Irvin Church have
given G’town the look of a
dangerous club from here on out.

If Pitt can somehow bottle
whatever it did against Boston
College on Tuesday and to
Connecticut a week, earlier, it
could find itself in the title game.
The Panthers are my dark horse
to prevent a St. ]ohn’s—G’town

final. Sean Miller gives Pitt the
edge in any close contest. The
Panthers’ problem has been
staying close on the road. Chris
McNeal is playing his finest
basketball of the year and needs
to stay on the blocks.
Connecticut is impossible to
figure. The Huskies have world-
class athletes like Scott Burrell
and Chris Smith, but they look
nothing like the dominant team
they were earlier in the season.
The Huskies still scare me, and
they could put it all together. I
still believe they can contend,
but they will fall a little short.
Seton Hall did not disappoint
those who waited for the club to
make a run, but the Pirates don’t
have their usual tournament look.
Luther Wright just hasn’t lived up
to expectations, andjerry Walker
cannot handle the Mournings of
the world down low. Without

Oliver Taylor, Terry Dehere has
struggled to find enough shots
within the offense. The Pirates
will be done early. Here’s another
team that will be a non-factor. I
don’t like Syracuse at all. All I'm

going to say is, “No center, no

defense, no chance.”

Boston College could create
matchup problems for some clubs
with its guard trio of Malcolm
Huckaby, Howard Eisley and
Gerrod Abram.Whoever is
matched against the Eagles can’t
just pencil in a W.

Desperation time. Clichés,
clichés. But it is time for desperate
measures for Villanova and
Providence. The ‘Cats have
quickly pieced themselves
together, but it won’t be enough
for an NCAA bid unless they win
the tourney. The Friars are just
happy to finish ahead of Miami.

made by careful consideration.
OK, so I put the teams’ names up
on a dart board and hit UConn.
Still, I made the pick. Then they
go and lose six of seven —— very
inconsiderate of them.

Pitt’s defense is very
considerate, as far as Villanova
guard Greg Woodard is
concerned. He looks like the
second coming of Larry Bird when
the Panthers go to Philadelphia,
and looks more like Tim “nothing

of the time. He scored a career-

THE PITT NEWS BIG EAST ISSUE

Continued from page B-6
Villanova. The guy can shoot the
lights out, but he only seems to
find openings against Pitt. When
the Panthers held Woodard to
seven points in their meeting at
Fitzgerald Field House, Pitt rolled
over the Wildcats and won by
nine points. He scored 53
Saturday, and the Panthers got
pasted.

Can you say “really weak
perimeter defense?” Losses to
Syracuse and Boston College have
been keyed by treys. Even in the
win over Connecticut, the
Panthers allowed Husky guards
Scott Burrell and Chris Smith "to
have way too many open three-
point shots. Pitt must fix this to
have a chance in the Big East
Tournament. Every top team in
the conference has at least one
top three-point gunner. Even
Syracuse has Davidjohnson, who
is second in the Big East in treys
per contest.

Another area that needs
improvement is consistency.
Yeah, I know, asking the Pitt
basketball team to be consistent
is like asking Pitt Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor to be
conscientious in spending money
on himself. Still, when the team
handles a strong UConn team
one game and forgets to show up
the next, something has to be
done. The problem is that the
team doesn’t have one consistent
go—to guy.

In the team’s biggest win of the
season, a win over then fifth-
ranked Kentucky, the expected
top scorers, Chris McNeal and

. Sean Miller, didn't get it done at

the offensive end. Ahmad Shareef
and Darren Morningstar came up
with 20+—point efforts. All four
are capable of big efforts, as are
Eric Mobley and Jerry

. McCullough, but nobody has

been consistent.

This should have been
expected. Sean Miller is a quality
point guard, but he is mu ch better
at setting up his teammates to
score than finding his own
offense. Anything other than an
open jump ‘shot from him on the
offensive "end is an aberration.
Despite showing flashes of
offensive ability, McNeal scored
in double figures only six times
last season. Morningstar showed
some signs of being consistent
early in the season, but he is a
limited athlete who has made
himself a decent low-post threat.
Shareef, Mobley and McCullough
are young players who might
develop into go—to guys, but they
aren’t there yet.

The other top teams do have
guys who can carry the team at
key moments, such as Smith at
UConn, Johnson at Syracuse,
Malik Sealy at St. John’s, Terry

_Dehere at Seton Hall and

Woodard at Villanova.

Georgetown center Alonzo
Mourning showed Pitt what a
dominant player can do when he
demolished the Panthers inside
earlier this season. When a team
goes into a rut, those dominant
players can take over. Pitt has no
one to do that, and it has shown
an annoying tendency to go into
long scoring droughts, which
have taken the team out ofgames
early all season long.

I guess since Ryne Sandberg just

supposed to lash out either about

Not too much is expected of

suggest that the once—premier

at least one to go further.
Connecticut could revive itself at
any time. I definitely don’t want
to face the Huskies in the first
round. They're a squad that could
roll if it gets by that first game. Pitt
also has a legitimate chance to
create problems if it gets in. The
Panthers are capable of holding
teams to 35- or 40-percent
shooting, and Sean Miller is the
type of steadying influence that
could help steal a game in the
first or second round. The key is
Chris McNeal. He can hammer a
lot of forwards when he gets
nasty on the blocks.

I’m not arguing that there aren’t
better conferences than the Big
East. There are two that are at
least its equal, if not better. One
is the Big T en; the other I’ll get to
later. But leagues like the ACC,
SEC and Pac-10 are overrated.
The two main problems with the
Big East are the officiating and
the six—foul rule. I’ve probably
watched 30 Big East games this
year, and I can count the number
of well—officiated contests on one
hand.

Everyone loves to debate which
conference is the strongest, and
this is a sure-fire way to ignite a
brawl. So here it is: the Big 8.

Two legitimate NCAA title
threats reside here: Kansas and
Missouri. I know the Tigers have
a miserable reputation in the
NCAAs; it’s like a morgue for
them.

Remember the Steve
Stipanovich, Jon Sundvold,‘
Derrick Chievous clubs —
dominant in the regular season
but harmless under the hot lights
of March Madness? Anthony
Peeler and company can change
all that.

Oklahoma State looked like
the club that could slit the throat
of King Duke early on, but it
faded. Now Kansas lurks. If Grant
Hill doesn’t return from a nasty
ankle sprain, I could see the
Jayhawks giving Duke major‘
problems. By the way, anyone
who doesn’t absolutely love
watching Rex Walters play should ‘
refrain from watching anymore.
basketball

Oklahoma State is still a solid
club, but I see Byron Houston
and company getting their tickets
punched in the round of 16.
However the Big 8 should land at

least three additional berths in
Oklahoma, Nebraska and Iowa
State. The Huskers knocked off
Oklahoma State when the
Cowboys were undefeated and
ranked second in the nation. They
gained further credibility by taking
out Kansas a couple of weeks
ago.

Now for a few fun lists:
All-Rim Rattlers: Latrell
Sprewell (Alabama): one of the
meanest dunkers you'll ever see.
Brian Davis (Duke): On a team
with the finest finishers in the
game, he somehow stands out.

Miami favorite inwomen ’s tournament

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

While the men’s Big East
Conference slate continues, the
women have finished their
regular-season slate with some
surprising results.

A newcomer came in and took
the rest of the conference and the
nation by storm, literally. A team
that never had finished above

.500 finished in a tie for second.

place, after winning 20 games.
While first place in the men’s race
has been described as “parity at
its best,” the women’s race for
second on down was just as
unpredictable.

The Miami Hurricanes (26-1
overall, 18-0 in conference action)
have emerged as a strong addition
for Big East women’s basketball.
The Hurricanes currently hold
the nation’s longest winning
streak at 26 games in a row. The
‘Canes come into the tourney as
the No. 1-seeded team.

They lost their first game of the
year to the Florida State Seminoles
in overtime, 71-69. Since then
they have cruised to a 26-1 overall
record, 18-0 in the conference.

They are the first team ever to
complete an entire conference
schedule undefeated. The closest
anyone in the Big East came to
beating them was Providence and
Connecticut in back-to-back
games.

Each time the ‘Canes emerged
as four-pointvictors, 87-85 against
the Friars and 70-66 over the
Huskies.

A large part of the ‘Canes’
success is dueto senior forward
Francis Savage. She finished No.
3 in scoring, netting 23.1 points a
game. Her average rose to 23.9

She led the league in rebounds,
snagging 10.5 boards a game.
She also ranked among
conference leaders in field-goal
percentage, free-throw
percentage and steals.

However she did not act alone
in leading Miami to an impressive
1991-92 campaign. Fellow senior
Jennie Hebert also had an
impressive season, statistically.
The 5-foot, 8-inch guard ranked
among conference leaders in five
categories, including a first place

used to determine the second,
third and fourth seeds after
Connecticut, Georgetown and
Providence all tied with a 13-5
conference mark. While
Connecticut had a lower overall

. winning percentage than either

the Hoyas or the Friars, they
fared better in head-to—head
competition to earn the No. 2
position.

The Connecticut Huskies (20-

THE PITT NEWS BIG EAST ISSUE I

9 overall, 13-5 in the Big East) lost
two starters from last year’s Final
Four squad. However a
tremendous recruiting year
helped bolster head coach Geno
Auriemma’s team.

Rebecca Lobo emerged as the
premier rookie in the league,
winning the weekly award for
best newcomer seven times, far
outdistancing the rest of the pack.
She shattered both UConn and
Big East rookie records, including
blocked shots and field goals
made.

Despite sitting out for four
games with a fractured left wrist,
she still managed to block 25
shots in conference play, 45 in all
games — good for second place.

The Huskies’ go-to player was
Wendy Davis. The senior guard
averaged 15.7 points a game to
lead the balanced UConn attack.
Davis also led the Big East in
three-point percentage, canning
47 percent of her attempts from
trey land.

Entering the last game of the
year, the Georgetown Hoyas
(19-7, 13-5) were looking fortheir
20th victory to lock up second
place with a victory over

Pittsburgh.
After jumping out to a 22-5

lead, things seemed well in hand

for the Hoyas. A 31-8 run by the

Panthers dashed their hopes for

their first 20-win season since
joining the Big East.

The Hoyas’ hopes rest on the
shoulders and the shooting hand
of guard Kris Whitfill. While her
average is down from 23 points a
game a year ago to just over 16,

her efforts combined with that of

three seniors helped lead head
coach Patrick Knapp to his best
season since coming to
Georgetown.

The team receiving the short
end of the stick in the tie-breaker
was the Providence Friars (20-
7, 13-5). Despite winning 20
games while losing only seven,
the Friars’ record against UConn
and Georgetown hurt them,
dropping them down to fourth.

Tracy Lis continued to be the
straw that stirs the Friars’ drink,
exploding out to a huge scoring
lead, only to be caught by Boston

Ho-hum. Greg Woodard scores
35 points for Villanova for the
second year in a row against Pitt
and tosses the Panthers into a
miserable, Saturday-night defeat
on the road again. But wait! It’s
the weekday Panther home game
at the Field House to save Pitt and
lead it to a decisive victory. This
routine is getting very tiring.

Counting Pitt’s victory against
Boston College, the Panthers now
have 17 victories and are on the
infamous NCAA bubble. After
seeing a touching senior night
that had Darren Morningstar give
a speech and Sean Miller so
choked up it brought tears to his

eyes, I don’t think any team could
have busted Pitt’s bubble on
Tuesday night.

Chris McNeal had a career—high
night in two categories with 27
points and 20 rebounds, but you
could tell this Panther squad was
loose and having a good time.
Each Panther wanted to make
sure everybody got in on the fun.
Now the fun is over, and it is time
for the Panthers to get down to
brass tacks.This Saturday Pitt plays
Georgetown, one of the favorites
to win the Big East title this year.
If this is another horrendous
Saturday road defeat for the
Panthers, they may be in trouble.

There are no more weekday home
games to pull them out of the fire.

So here is"a‘rﬁaj'oeque§t_ion for
the Panther fans this season: Do
we have enough wins to go to the
NCAA tournament? This question
has a familiar ring to it because

Pitt finds itself asking it almost i
every year. If the Panthers win on '

Saturday against Georgetown, I
don’t think there is any doubt
they are going to the tournament.
With 17 wins the chances are

 

THE PITT NEWS BIG EAST ISSUE

probably a little higher than 50-
50.The consolation prize for the
Panthers if they don’t get an NCAA
Tournament bid is a high seed in
the NIT Tournament with a
possible first-round game against
Penn State at the Field House.
That may not be so bad —
especially if Pitt can go far in the
NIT Tournament.

How will Pitt do in the Big East
Tournament? That remains to be
seen. Questions, questions,
questions —— the end of the
Panthers’ basketball season is full
of them. After Pitt’s see-saw
season, this is nothing new. We
constantly found ourselves asking

B-11

Seesaw season will decide Panthers’ postseason fate

how Pitt would play from one
night to the next, so a full season
of this has conditioned the Panther
fans, who are now used to
indecision. Pitt seems right at
home on the NCAA fencepost,
falling one way or another —
from good fortune to bad to good
to bad.

With the postseason see-saw
rocking up and down, at least
there is a prize on either end of it
for the Panthers this year: the
NCAA or NIT tournaments with
the Panthers’ performance these
next two weeks carrying all the
weight to rock the see-saw one
way or the other.

Season

Continued from page B-2
Think of the Big East in the 1980s.

There were some awesome-

teams. (Georgetown and St.John’s
in 1985 come to mind.) But even
more memorable are players like
Chris Mullin, Patrick Ewing,
Charles Smith, Dana Barros,
Walter Berry, etc. Now there are
teams that retain quality although
the players change. At
Connecticut, you can see the
system in place that will make
Husky basketball successful for
years to come.

. Now on to other considerations:
The usual cornucopia of awards
and honors aren’t really for me.
However I do have particular
visions in mind from this season
in Big East basketball. Among
them are Sealy’s dunking of an
alley-oop pass from Jason
Buchanan in the game against
,Connecticut; the dunk that Scott
Burrell had at Fitzgerald Field
House last week and Dave
Johnson nailing a long-range
three-pointer in countless games
throughout the season.

Other favorites of mine ——
though not as pretty, perhaps —
are Billy Curley’s 30-point
wrecking of Syracuse in a game
B.C. lost; seeing the rebounding
strength of Providence for the
first time (those guys really get
after the ball!); the uncanny
shooting of UConn’s Smith and
the dominant play of one small
guard from Blackhawk High
School, who admittedly did not
have the body for Big East
basketball, one Sean Miller.

Time and again, opposing
coaches would extoll the virtues
of the steady floor-leader.
Kentucky’s Rick Pitino, Villanova’s
Rollie Massimino, Providence’s
Rick Barnes — those coaches
and more credited the success of
Pitt this season to Miller, and
rightfully so. Miller has more to
do with the success of this team
than anyone.

Of course, what would a
college—hoops overview be
without lists. So here they are, in
no particular order:

The Big East All-Dunk Team:
Sealy, Burrell, Mobley, Ahmad
Shareefof Pitt and Calvin Byrd of
Villanova.

The All-Ball—handling Wizard
