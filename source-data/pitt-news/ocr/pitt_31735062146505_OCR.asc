The action takes place in the coun-
try home of George -Marden, an Eng-
lish gentleman. His wife, Olivia,
when a girl, had married in Australia
a fraud promoter, Telworthy, who had
been arrested, and whom she believed
to have died in jail. The-‘home life
of the Mardens is ideal save that they
slightlydiffer over the proposed mar-
riage of their niece, Dinah, to a young’
artist, Brian Strange. One day, Mr.
Pim, an . aged-and somewhat forget-
ful Englishman recently returned
from Australia, happens into the-' Mar-

is still alive. This, it true, -would

formance oi duties assigned to them

ties which members of_ the student

Field. The next games, Friday
night and Saturday afternoon, are on
the Braddock‘ Field with ‘Penn State.

The game this afternoon, with 'a

‘team that has been 3, ﬁxture on the

Pitt schedule for several years, is
looked upon as a Panther victory.
The Collegians’ club is a local or-
ganization going ?‘’'onto ‘the diamond
for its twenty-fourth year. Besides

meeting Pitt, Kiski Prep, West Vir- .

ginia ‘Universityand a large number
of other Tri-State schools are on its
schedule for thcpopening of the sea-
son. a

The State games are billed for 6
o'clock Friday ' and 3:30 Saturday.
Because these games are the most
important on’ the Panther schedule,
plans are being: laid for the accom-
modation of a.7l~a.rge crowd of fans.-
-In the first game, it is expected
that Istwetonic Willa. face Longhurst

on the mound. Either Lefty Hill or
"Alf Schmidt, ‘

whose ﬂinging ‘arm
has improved, will be in the box
for the second game. Harley will ﬁnd
several local boys from adjoining
towns against his men, Johnny Reed
of.Braddock, Ken Loeffler of Beaver
Falls, and -Norman Mcvieker _of.Mon_
City, playing for 8 Bezdek. Mike
Palm, ‘the Ijfar-sung backﬁeld grid
star, who‘ failed against Pitt last
fall, iscaptainiand will match his
wits against Jakie Bohren in base-
ball. A

one event, the varsity‘ Pitt-Tech golf
match, will be called off on Monday,

On May 12, Monday, the only sched.’

Carnegie Tech golf team is practically
disbanded. As yet, no practice has
caused it to go the way of the Skibo
varsity diamond squad. This. also will
automatically cancel the match billed
for next Monday.

On Tuesday, May 13, the varsity
racqueteers could not play Juniata be-.

The Pitt Freshman nine defeated
Kiski Prep school baseballers, for
the second time this season, last
Saturday afternoon at Saltsburgp.
Pa. The ﬁnal score was 6 .t0 3-
Whitmore, Kiski, broke down in the
eighth, giving two passes and three
hits, Whose four runs cost‘ him the
game. The cubs played ﬂawless
ball, while. Kiski’s errors and the
inability to bunch the hits she got
-from ‘Betti were her weaknesses.
For Pittsburgh, Grindle, Liddle and
M.cMunn each hit once, while Dun-
mire cracked aﬁsingle and a double.
Archibald, the Fresh nine’s center-

ﬁelder, ‘failed to get a hit, but he
tallied two of the six runs.

‘Pitt, however, is not to be‘ so eas-
ily counted out of the running. Early

dope ﬁnds State little stronger than -

last year, and Pitt is as strong, if not
slightly. stronger than she was a year
ago. The Mountaineers must be con-
sidered as possible winners, but last
year they came to Pittsburgh with a
win over Pittxin a dual meet, only
to lose in the excitement before the
ﬁnish. Whether or not West Virginia
will come through stronger in the in-’
tercollegiate competition this year is
not known, but the local critics are
prone to‘ think that the race for ﬁrst
honors lies with Pitt and State. With
Robusch, Johnson, Corbett, Martin,
Cowan, Wadkins and Schroedel going

hard to stop.

The Mountaineers are conﬁdentjotj
doing well but despite their -optimism.
they cherish no hopes ..of ﬁnishing"
ahead of Penn State.
