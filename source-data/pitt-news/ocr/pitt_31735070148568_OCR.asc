national
rankings

Kelly Lyons
For The Pitt News

Pitt moved six spots closer to be-
coming the nation’s best college
this year. _

U.S. News and World report re-
leased its annual 2012 Best College
rankings at midnight on Monday
and put Pitt at the 58th spot, tied
with University of Connecticut,
University of Florida and Texas
A&M-College Station. This is a
bump up from Pitt’s ranking as
64th last year.

When it comes to Big East ri-
vals, Pitt beat out West Virginia,
Syracuse and Rutgers on the list,
but Penn State trailed came out
ahead at spot 45. Carnegie Mel-
lon University came in 23rd and
Princeton and.Harvard tied" for
ﬁrst place.

David Dejong, vice provost for .

academic planning and resources
management in the Office of the
Provost, said that Pitt was happy
with the ranking. S

“We work very hard and in-
vest a lot to ‘achieve continued
improvement in academic pro-
grams,” Dejong said. “So to see
these efforts recognized through
improved rankings, like the U.S.
News and World Report, is very
gratifying.”

According to the U.S. News and
World Report website, the purpose.

‘Board will provide answers

Michael Ringling
For The Pitt News

The allocations process will likely become more
transparent with ‘a new addition to the Student
Government Board website.

Board member Emily Hoover said at Tues-
day’s meeting that her initiative to help student
groups better understand allocations should
be up and running soon. A

' With the help of the Allocations Commit-
tee, Hoover compiled a list of frequently asked
allocation questions and answers to be put on
the site. She said she is waiting for the board
to review the questions before the webmaster
posts them.

Another feature of the FAQ section will al-
low users to submit questions directly to the
committee. -

“Your question will become a frequently
asked question, and then we’ll never have ques-

tions again,” Hoover said, sporting apurple I

shirt worn by many of the board and commit-
tee members. ’ 1

The Board members wore the Pitt Make a
Difference Day shirts to advertise for the armual
event, which takes place on Oct. 22.

“We are going tobe doing some crazy new
marketing ideas,” SGB board member Ryan
Gayman said. “But we are going to be needing

more bodies. We are going to be doing a ﬂash‘.

mob with the purple shirts.’.’ ‘
Gayman urged those in attendance to not
only sign up to participate in both the cam-
pus-wide service day but also aid in spread-
ing awareness by wearing the T-shirts each
week.

SGB president Molly Stieber opened the
weekly meeting with comments on Monday’s
meeting with the Pennsylvania State Appro-
priations Committee where she sat on a Univer-
sity panel with Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and other Pitt ofﬁcials to discuss state budget
cuts. .

“To have the opportunity to do that on Pitt’s

campus was an honor,” she said. “We really
need to continue to have those discussions.”

Stieber expressed gratitude to those who ~

attended the meeting and said it was a way for
Pitt to open up discussion with state senators
about the amount of state funding the Univer-

, sity will receive next year.

The Board discussed SGB elections, which
are set for Nov. 17. Students interested in run-
ning for president or a position on the Board
can pick up a packet outside of the SGB office
starting the second week‘ in October.

Students are required to get 200 signatures
if they are interested in running for board and
250 for potential presidential candidates.

Tricia Dougherty, a member of Rainbow
Alliance, utilized the open ﬂoor to encourage
participation at a “Safer Sex Workshop” that
will take place at 8:45 p.m. on Thursday in

dent. 0 p. ,

“Whenever I’m not in class or doing clinicals,
Fm studying,” Walls said.

But according to one publication, Walls’ Pitt
workload is pretty easy. The Daily Beast, the on-
line home of Newsweek magazine, ranked the
University of Pittsburgh as number 20 on the list
of “Least Rigorous Colleges.”

Patricia Beeson, Pitt’s provost and senior vice
chancellor, said that she didn’t have much to say
about the recently published ranking.

 “Its methodology is difficult to interpret, and
it may contain ﬂawed assumptions about how to
measure academic rigor,” Beeson saidinanemail.
"WhatI canpointoutisthatweareonthis listwith
some of the highest-caliber, rigorous research in-

stitutions inthe country, includingUCLA, Berkeley,
Johns Hopkins, Illinois, UNC, Wisconsin and the
other universities cited in this study.”

U.S. News and World Reports released its
rankings earlyTuesdayforthe 2012 Best Colleges,
where Pitt came in 58th, which is improved from
its 64th I‘aI_1king last year.

- The Daily Beast ranked SUNY at Bingharn-
ton as the least rigorous school in the country.

the University of California-Berkeley, University
of Southern California and George Washington
University. The rankings only include the top 25
least rigorous schools.

Representatives from The Daily Beast could
not be reached for comment.

Walls, who graduated from West Allegheny
High School and ranked ninth out of 243 in her
class, said that she was still wait—listed when she
applied to Pitt. ‘

“When I came to Pitt and began the nursing

program, I realized just how intense our school

is,” Walls said.

The Daily Beast’s 2011 survey, which came out
inlateAugust, rated schools thatadmitted students
with an average SAT score of at least 1250.

The ratings took into accountthe universities’
freshman retention rates, student opinion, stu-
dent-to-faculty ratios, the school’s average Critical
Readingand MathSATscores and RateMyProfes-
sors.com student-posted evaluations.

According to the survey, The Daily Beast
reported Pitt’s student-to-faculty ratio to be 15:1,
witha93 percentfreshman retention rate. It also
reported Pitt’s average SATCritical Reading score
between 570-680 and the SAT Math score be-
tween 590-680. The numbers have gone up this
year though as, accordingto Pitt’s Office ofAdmis-
sions and Financial Aid website, the average SAT
Critical Reading score_ is between 590-700 and

the SAT Math score is between 610-720 for the

2011 freshman class.

, SUNY atBinghamton, the leastrigorous school,
has a student-to-faculty ratio of 20:1, a 90 percent
freshman retention rate, an average SAT Critical
Reading score between 580-660 and an average
SAT Math score between 610-690, according to
the survey. The most rigorous school on the top

to-faculty ratio of 11:1, a 96 percent freshman
retention rate, an average SAT Critical Reading

score between 640-720.

“I think people still think of how Pitt used to
be,” Walls said. “In the past few years it’s become
much harderto get into.” 6

According to Pitt’s Oﬂice of Admissions and
 Aid website, 13,541 of the 23,407 2011
freshman applicants were admitted. Pitt is cat-
egorized as a “more selective” school by the U.S.

57.8% acceptance rate in 2010.

Chris Kyper, ajunior neuroscience major, said

“Between labs, lectures and studying, it’s not
difficult to spend more than 40 hours per week

she does. '

“IfI don’t have a rigorous schedule, I don’t '

college rankings
unimportant  

Take pride, Panthers: Our school
jumped six spots in the national
college rankings.

We think it’s great that Pitt’s
place in the annual U.S. News
and World Report national col-
lege rankings went up to 58th
from 64th. We think administra-
tors, faculty, and current students
should be proud of their positive
collective impact on the univer-
sity. And we think our campus
certainly gets a boost of positive
self-esteemvfrom favorable rank-
ings of any kind.

But we also think it’s nothing

to makea big fuss over.

Many of us have younger sib-
lings who will soon have to make
a decision about which college to
attend. A sizeable number of high
school students in Pennsylvania
will want to remain in the state
because it’_s cheaper, so they’re
likely to compare Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and other in-state colleges
to see which one’s better.

So which school is the best op-
tion‘? '

Is it Pitt at No. 58? How about
Temple, way down the list at No.
132? And wow, did Penn State re-
ally crack the Top 50 at No. 45?

The numbers themselves are
merely representations of one
publication’s speciﬁc algorithms
that attempt to deﬁne academic
excellence and peer —— read: sub-
jective —- surveys from notable
administrators at each school.

But what a quick glance at the
rankings doesn’t tell future college
or graduate school students is how
happy or successful they will be at
their school of choice. A country
valley sandwiched between two

of Pennsylvania’s biggest cities
might be the home of a higher-
ranked university, but what about
the learning environment‘? And
the curriculum? And what about
the intangibles that make students
able to function in society?

No number, ranking or statistic
holds the key to the door of your
dream school.

Even when it comes to grad
schools, ‘which many college
students consider each year, it’s
common for students to opt for a

program that falls in the Top 20. 1

Using that logic, it might be tempt-
ing for some to take up Library
and Information Studies — Pitt’s
programs in this ﬁeld are all within
the Top 10, with Health Librarian-
ship program ranked as No. 1 in
the nation.

_ But no ranking can tell you
what will work for you as an in-

dividual.

Picking a university or a grad
school is one of the more impor-
tant decisions in our lives. Letting
numbers and statistics steer us
one way oranother is detrimental
to our educational experience --
something that should be tailored

- to ﬁt a student’s personality, ambi-

tions and ideas. The perfect school
for a student should be tailored to
his or her needs.

We think numbers have a place
in choosing colleges and grad
schools. But instead of overall
rankings being most important,
it’s ultimately a combination of
numbers that opens the door to a
successful —— or unsuccessful -
future.

We just have to crack that code
for ourselves.r.;I

Toyota team members inspect a Camry last year at the manufacturing plant in Georgetown, Ky.

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

I like to think of myself as a pret-
ty good American. I can fold a ﬂag,
swing a baseball bat and bake an
apple pie with my eyes closed.

Apparently, though, to ﬁilly ex-
press my love for this country, I will
need to do something else when I
graduate: buy a Toyota Camry.

Many consider such statements
treasonous. Through a certain line
of logic, people who buy Camrys are
the ones destroying this country,
sending j obs overseas and millions
to unemployment lines. I might as
well just be shooting bald eagles
with that kind of language.

But according to the 2011 Cars.
corn American-Made Index, which
ranks car models by how Ameri-
can the parts and assembly are, the
Camry, which is manufactured in
Kentucky and Indiana, is the most
American of all models, beating out
the traditional American manufac-
turers in Detroit. Buying American
isn’t necessarily the most American
thing to do. A .

After all, if this list is to be be-
lieved, the $20,195 spent on a Cam-
ry sends more wealth to the United
States than the $20,195 spent on a
domestic car. The Chevy Cruze, for
instance, a similar size and style
car, is manufactured in Russia and

South Korea, meaning that a well-
meaning “buy American” consumer

‘is in this case more likely to be help-

ing a Russian get a Babushka doll
than an American get a meatloaf. In
dollars and cents, the Camry helps
Americans more.

As the world continues to be-
come more globalized, such situ-
ations will continue to occur more
often. Those of us who want to help
the American worker and economy
by buying American can’t simply
rely on our gut instincts to lead us
to the best choices. Our natural and
biological reactive instincts, after
all, are designed to help us avoid
lions on the savarmah, not to help us
navigate a global marketplace.

Producing an even stronger gut

reaction than Toyotas is the label -

“Made in China.” Since China holds
large proportions of our foreign
debt and has a seemingly far more
robust economy, many Americans
consciously avoid trying to buy
products made in the country.
Earlier this year, ABC News emp-
tied a family’s house of imported
items, leaving it almost bare. Then
the program replaced everything
in the house with American-made
products. 4 ' -

But much like how impulsively
not buying Toyota cars isn’t the
best thing for the United States,
impulsively not buying Chinese
products isn’t necessarily the best

thing either. According a report
from the Federal Reserve Bank of
San Francisco, of the 2.7 percent of
all consumer spending that “Made
in China” represents — yes, we only
spend 2.7 percent of our cash on
Chinese-made products — only 1.2

percent represents the costs of the

goods. In otherwords, about 55 per-

cent of our purchase stays inside the

country, going to services provided

by U.S. businesses and workers who

transport, sell and market those

goods..

So people seeking a trade war

' with China and trying to win back

jobs from overseas should realize
that the best way to increase Ameri-
can manufacturing and jobs isn’t to
try to make that 1.2 percent bigger.
Low taxes or handouts won’t bring
back the types of jobs that represent
that 1.2 percent. These line jobs are
gone forever.

Instead, we need to see why
certain jobs are here and grow that
piece of the -pie. Toyota Camrys are
manufactured here for a reason;
after all. American workers are
very productive, and our legal and
economic structure is conducive to
some companies being here. In oth-
er cases, it is engineering and busi-
ness jobs that stay here because of
an intellectual and cultural climate
that supports science and creative
destruction, which allows very high

efficiency in output.

_ In other words, launching im-
pulsive attacks toward foreigners
taking jobs away isn’t a productive
exercise. The arrows of economic
history mean that things will be
made where they are cheapest to
produce relative to other products
in that country. American workers

will never be able to make clothing.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

In regards to Rachel Peters’ re-
sponse to a letter from an atheist
expressing her reluctance to attend
a public memorial in which a pas-
tor was doing a prayer reading, Ms.
Peters has one thing correct: “One
group of people  should not de-
cide proceedings for others.” But Ms.
Peters’ suggestion that we must all

' ‘ “occasionally make sacriﬁces” is dis-
ingenuous and unnecessary. With a
secular ceremony, no sacriﬁces are

rneeded.-.1-.  A‘ I ‘

....-.,-.-~ 4...- . -......._...c._. .

There is-a misunderstanding 

“secular” equals “atheist.” “Secular”

makes no comment on religion. Ex-
pressing a desire for a secular cer-
emony (like Mayor Bloomberg’s New
York City ceremony) is asking that
all religious sentiments be left out,
including an atheist’s lack of religious
beliefs.

It is easier for Christians to ask
others to be tolerant when they are
consistently never the ones asked to
tolerate another Viewpoint. What if,
instead of a pastor, the 9/11 ceremony
had only featured an atheist speaker?
Perhaps this speaker got up and said,
“,I’_rn, glad we are all here to remember

those who died, becauselainemory  I I

is all we have. There is no such thing

Would Ms. Peters be writing
about how we need to make sacri-

only want their own beliefs to be

At a secular university, there
should be secular ceremonies.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Gibbs competes in China at World University Games

R] Sepich
Staff Writer

When Pittar_1.d.Notr9 Dameplay each...

V other on Dec. 27, Ashton Gibbs and

Tim Abromaitis will stand on op-
posite sides of the basketball court.
But for two weeks this summer, the
two Big East standouts played for
the same team. .

Gibbs and Abromaitis played for
the United States at the Men’s World
University Games in Shenzhen, Chi-
na, where the Americans ﬁnished
ﬁfth. Shenzhen, a major city located
just north of Hong Kong, is several
times larger than Pittsburgh.

The trip marked the third time
Gibbs has traveled overseas to play
basketball.

In 2009, he played for Jamie
Dixon’s U19 team in New Zealand.
Last summer, Gibbs spent time in
Ireland on a trip with the rest of the
Pitt basketball team. f

“It was deﬁnitely a culture
shock,” Gibbs said of going to Chi-
na. “I’ve been to Ireland and New
Zealand, but both of those countries
speak English. I learned about their
culture and it was a good experience
on the court and off the court.”

Gibbs said the language barrier
made it difﬁcult for him to com-
municate. l

Abromaitis said bonding with
his teammates was one of the best
aspects of the trip.

“It was pretty cool being around
some of the best players in college
basketball and playing with them
and hanging out with them off the
court,” he said. “As a team, I think
we bonded really well.”

He added that he got along par-
ticularly well with Gibbs.

“It seemed like by the end of
the trip the two of us were pretty
much doing everything together,”
he said. 1

Gibbs and Abromaitis weren’t
the only players on the team from
the Big East: Syracuse guard Scoop
Jardine also made the United States
roster. ~

For all three players, the jour-
ney to. China began with a tryout
process that took place in Colorado
Springs, Colo..

“The tryouts were tough,” Gibbs
said. ‘?It was two-a-days and you’re

‘playing against some of the best

players in the country each and
every day. It was deﬁnitely a good
experience and I think I got better

from it phying against gre§t,p,1§z;,_

ers.”

Once Gibbs made it through the
grueling tryouts and earned a spot
on the roster, he had to adjust to a
coaching staff led by Purdue head
coach Matt Painter.

“Coach Painter’s style was a dif-
ferent one to get used to,” Gibbs

, said. “But [Coach Painter and Coach

Dixon] both expect the same things
— everybody has to play hard and
play unselﬁsh.” A .

Rather than Pitt’s half-court de-
fensive system, Painter frequently
employed the press. Gibbs said that
helped to add another dimension
to his game.

“I deﬁnitely feel like a more ver-

M satile player,” he said. “I’m more

in shape too after playing defense
full court so I’ll bring it back with
me to Pitt.”

Gibbs led the team in several
statistical categories, including
minutes (21.8) and assists per game
(2.3).

He also averaged 11.6 points
per game and ﬁnished with a 46.6
ﬁeld goal percentage and a 95.0 free
throw percentage.

Despite having some of the best
talent in college basketball on their
roster and ﬁnishing with a tourna-
ment-best 7-1 record, the United
States’ team didn’t achieve its goal
of winning the gold medal.

Lithuania handed the United
States its only loss of the tourna-
ment, a 76-74 defeat in the quarter-
ﬁnals, but the loss cost the Ameri-
cans any chance of a medal.

“I feel like we should’ve won it
all,” Gibbs said. “That was a real
tough loss.” .

Painter said in a statement on
the USA Basketball website that he
was proud of the team for continu-
ing to play hard after the loss.

“For these guys, their goal was
to win the goal medal,” he added.
“Then after you stub your toe and
lose in the quarters, a lot of people
would kind of check out and go
through the motions. These guys
didn’t. You have to give them credit
for coming out here and winning
the ﬁght.” n

SOCCER

Pitt men, Women go
winless over weekend  

R] Sepich & Kelly Flanigan
Staﬂ’ Writers

Pitt 1, Air Force 2
Pitt 0, Bowling Green 1

The Pitt men’s soccer team performed well
defensively this weekend, but offensive strug-
gles continued to plague the Panthers as they
dropped two games. _

‘ Pitt (1—4—1) fell to Air Force and Bowling
Green in the Pitt/ Nike Invitational with scores
of 2-1 and 1-0, respectively. I A

“Our biggest problem is putting the ball
in the back of the net,” redshirt senior mid-
ﬁelder Ryan Brode said. “I think besides that
we did a really good job defensively.”

The Panthers haven’t scored more than
one goal in a game all season, but their op-
ponents have only scored more than two
goals once. ,

In 62 shot attempts this year, the Panthers
have scored just four goals. Pitt scores .67 goal
per game, as opposed to 1.5 goals per game
for its opponents. -

Pitt’s shot percentage of .065 also falls

_.....,._......,....,..,.,.. ‘‘ ._.._..__.._...,._,..,_._....

We made a step
forward today in
the way we were

playing.
—Ryan Brode

rrrrr 99 ““*““*“““““”

behind its opponent’s percentage of .106.

In Pitt’s lone win, a 1-0 victory over Stony
Brook, the Seawolves still out shot the Pan-
thers 19-11. Stony Brook also ﬁnished with 11
shots on goal to the Panthers’ seven.

Nine of the 11 Panther starters are fresh-
men or sophomores who will likely develop
as the season progresses. While Pitt played
better in the second game of the weekend,
the team still needs to work on improving
its scoring abilities.

“The goalkeeping has been good,” Brode
said after the game against Bowling Green.
“We made a step forward today in the way
we were playing.”

Friday night’s game against the Air Force
Falcons (2-1) left Pitt with an opportunity to
tie the game in the ﬁnal seconds on a header
by Alex Harrison.

The shot hit the crossbar and missed
crossing the line. Freshman, goalkeeper Lee
Johnston saved four shots for the Panthers
during the match. ’

Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher cited sev—_

eral problems for the loss. G

“We did have a chance to tie it with the one
that hit the cross bar, but we didn’t play like
we’re capable of,” Luxbacher said in a news
release on the Pitt Athletics website. “I do give
Air Force credit‘. They played really hard.”

The Panthers anticipated a tough match-
up with the Falcons, who are known for re-
cording a large amount of shots on goal. Air
Force’s forwards recorded eight shots on goal
in the second half and 14 total, doubling Pitt’s
seven shots.

The Panthers took on Bowling Green Uni-
Versity (4- -0) on Sunday, Bowling Green’s
lone goal came off a through-ballbreakaway
that ricocheted into the net for a score.

Due to a collision, Pitt freshman goal— A

keeper Leejohnson had to leave the game in
the 67”‘ minute and senior Hami Kara played
the remaining minutes. I

Luxbacher didn’t want to use the injury
as an excuse, he said in a news release on
the Pitt Athletics website, but added that the
delay might have affected the Panthers’ play
as Bowling Green scored shortly after. _

“We did play pretty good soccer today, and
I think we will be okay,” he added. “However,
we have to score some goals [to win], so we
are looking for combinations up fron .”

Brode said that despite the team’s early
hardships, the’ goals for the season — to make
the Big East Tournament and the NCAA Tour-
nament — remain the same.

The road won’t be easy for the Panthers. In I

the difficult Big East Conference, Pitt will face
ﬁve teams that competed in the 2010 NCAA
Championship: West Virginia, Providence,
Notre Dame, Connecticut and Georgetown.

Pitt freshman midﬁelder Manny Morgado
and sophomore defender Robert Iledare both
made the All-Tournament team.

The Panthers will take on Duquesne on
Sept. 16 at 5 p.m. at Ambrose Urbanic Field
on Pitt’s upper campus.

“We need to get out of this funk, and we
will,” junior forward Ashley Cuba said. “We’re
looking forward to starting over in confer-
ence play, and we’re determined to come out
strong.”

The. Panthers have scored ﬁve goals in
94 shot attempts this season while their op-
ponents have scored 20 goals in 147 shot at?
tempts. Like the men’s team, the Pitt women
are outscored .62 goals per game to 2.50 goals
per game by their opposition.

Pitt also has a new goalkeeper in senior
Kristina Rioux, who spent previous years
playing behind former standout and current
volunteer assistant coach Morie Kephart.

Pitt has 39 shots on goal in 94 attempts,
while the Panthers’ opponents have 69 shots
on goal in 147 attempts. The opposition is

’ also getting off about seven more shots per

game. .

The road trip got off to a difﬁcult start
Friday against Central Michigan (5-1-0) when
the Chippewas beat the Panthers 2-0.

The two-time defending Mid-American
Conference champions scored one goal in
each half and controlled much of the game
as they outshot the Panthers 17-7, including
11-0 in shots on goal.

“In Friday’s game, it took us 65 minutes
before we really started to play,” Pitt head

coach Sue—Moy Chin said. “You just can’t af- ’

ford to do that.”

Rioux did her best to keep her team in the
game with nine saves.

On Sunday, Oakland (2-5-0) handed Pitt
its third consecutive defeat with a 3-0 result
after scoring one goal in the ﬁrst half and
adding two in the second.

“We knew Pitt had a tough game Friday,
and we wanted to take advantage of tha ,”
head coach Nick O’Shea said in a news release
on Oaldand’s website.

Despite the Panthers’ defeat, Chin said she
saw some positives on Sunday.

“I thought we started out pretty well and

had some good chances to score,” she said. .

“We missed a breakaway, and you just can’t
squander those chances. We left the other
team in the game, and it came back to hurt
us.”

The season will only get tougher for the
Panthers with Big East conference play start-
ing Thursday against Marquette. Last year, the
Pitt had a 4-2 record entering its ﬁrst game of
the conference season. With Kephart in goal,
the Panthers scored 0.94 goal per game to
their opponents’ 0.61 goal per game.

Marquette is currently 7-1, coming off a.

2-1 win over Indiana

“Hopefully this weekend was a wake—up
call for everyone and we can bounce back
strong going forward,” Chin said. I,
