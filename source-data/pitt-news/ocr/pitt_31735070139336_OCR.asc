Republican mayoral candidate Mark Desantis says Pittsburgh needs to get control of its municipal spending.

DeSantis courts students

by Leigh Remizowski

It seems like a valid ques-
tion to ask a mayoral candidate
— who is your favorite past
Pittsburgh mayor?

I Mark DeSantis would
choose William J. Howard, a
name that he admits most prob-

ably have not heard.

Howard was mayor of Pitts-
burgh in 1845. '

On April 10 of that year, at

Downtown ﬁre “left the city
in ashes,” DeSantis said at an
event co—hosted by the Pitt Law
Republicans and the Pitt Col-

t lege Republicans in the Union

yesterday afternoon. ,
Howard lost his home and

was left with very 1itt1e,_the
Republican" mayoral candidate
said, and “if anybody had an
excuse to leave the city, it was
Mr. Howard.” 5
DeSantis parallels the .eco-
nomic disparity that Pittsburgh
faces now with the physical
damage it experienced after

Law applications

down 12 percent

by Emily Lyons
Staﬂ Writer

With applications to the Pitt

_ Law School down 12 percent .
for the ﬁrst time in seven years

— now is the opportune time to
apply.

“This admissions season is
a great time" to’ apply because
although Pitt Law has not low-
ered it’s admission standards,

the competition levels are re— 

of applicants.

“We accepted more to ﬁll
slots,” McCall said.

Despite low application
rates, Pitt Law has maintained
its admission standards. i

In past years Pitt Law had in-
creased standards, but because
of the decline in applications
the standards this admissions
period will remain the same,
with an average LSAT score of
159 and an aver-

duced,” Char-

McCall began in 2005

admission cen-

admission standards nation-

In the 2005-06 school year
Pitt Law accepted 29 percent
of applicants, but last year, Pitt
Law received ‘fewer applica-

_ when the num-
ber of applications submitted to
law schools fell by 4.8 percent.
In 2006 the number fell by-an
additional 7.4 percent.

Both Marietti and McCall
agree that there is no tangible
reason for ’ these immediate
trends.

were increases,” Marietti said,

Forum supplements Africa lessons

by Holden Slattery
Staﬂ Writer

If the only knowledge stu-
dents have of Africa comes
from the daily news and the
average’ high school textbook,
it’s probably not the whole sto-
ry.

At least that’s what the or-
ganizers of yesterday’s Teach
AfricatYout'h Forum, held at
the David L. Lawrence Con-

vention Center Downtown,
maintain. .

About 1,900 middle and
high school students and 100

teachers from Pittsburgh and_

West Virginia attended the fo-
rum, where a panel of ambas-
sadors and government ofﬁ-
cials spoke about both serious

...problems and positive devel-

With election day looming, the Stu-
dent Government Board passed a resolu-
tion last night calling for the amendment
of  Nondiscrimination Policy.

The resolution stated that the “actual

. or perceived gender identity or expres-

sion should be added to the list of terms
on which discrimination is prohibited .
“I think that it was something that

, needed to be done a long time ago,” board
‘ member Lacee Ecker said.

While he commended the board on
its unanimous approval of theresolution,
Rainbow'Alliance president Aaron Arnold
said that the process has only begun.

“The work does not stop here,” Arnold

said. “Rainbow Alliance will take this to
the board of trustees to vote on amending
the actual Nondiscrimination Policy.

SafeRider talks continuing .

SGB president Shady Henien also up-

dated students on his recent talks with:

SafeRider.

Along with board member Alexis Chi-
di, Henien will attend an upcoming trans-
portation committee meeting to request
permission to listen to tapes of student
calls for help.

Until Henien and the transportation
committee determine the root of the prob-
lems riders have been complaining about
-— such as busy signals or denial of service
— Henien called for students to remain pa-
tient and civil. ." 4 '

“Although there __may be many issues
with SafeRider, and the most popular and
easiest route to take in any situation is
to complain and make Facebook groups
lashing out at a certain topic, the bestway
to deal with this situation is in a smart
manner, which means we must take both
diplomatic and respectful approaches

‘with the administration of the department

of transportation,” he said.

Since Monday’s article in The Pitt
News regarding Saferider, the service has
already increased the maximum number
of students who can wait on hold at once
from six to ten.

Statue selection process developing

In preparation for this year’s Light
Up Night, Henien announced that the sev
lection process for the decoration of the
ten ﬁberglass panthers, which the board
purchased over the summer for about

on policy
$60,000, will not be random after all.

Instead of randomly selecting ten stu-
dent organizations to decorate the pan-
thers, SGB will appoint a selection com-
mittee to review applications submitted
by student groups.

Any Student Organization Resource
Center-certiﬁed group can submit a pro-
posal of its painted panther statue. The
committee —— which will consist of rep-

resentatives from the Blue and Gold So— _

ciety, faculty, staff and the art school -
will then select the ten best candidates to
decorate the‘ statues.

.“I feel that this is the most fairand
unbiased group to make :selections,»'' as
well’ asiadd various elemental perspec-
tives; which will be vital in critiquinggtthe
proposals by the student groups,” Henien
said. . ' ‘i A 7 g If P

“I wanted to make this in the most fair
andfun way as possible forsall Pitt stu-
dents.” I

SGB has received permission to place
the decorated statues at Sutherland Hall,
Towers, the Towers patio, Alumni Hall
and the Petersen Events Center. Henien
is also hoping for approval from Hillman

‘Library, Benedum Hall and the Cathedral

of Learning.
“This is going to be an amazing oppor-

. tunity that will instill some pride in this

campus that is surely lacking,” Henien
said.

USA Today program to continue

In addition to instilling pride around
campus, SGB decided to continue Pitt’s
participation in the USA Today Reader-

‘ ship program, which is in its second free-

trial period since the board introduced it
last year.

’ If accepted, the program will bring
both the USA Today and New York Times
to numerous locations around campus
daily. The prograiln will cost $2.50 per

undergraduate student, per semester.

“This is incredible,” Henien said, “as
it will enhance the academic stature of
the University and offer a worldwide per-
spective on current events.” A

The relationship with USA Today
will also bring CEO job fairs to cam-
pus, which the USA Todayiprovides to
its member universities. Both Penn State
and Camegie—Mellon participate in this
program.

Whether or not the SGB decides to
continue this program beyond the latest
trial period hinges on _a student vote cur-
rently being taken online at my.pitt.edu.

Raftis‘ fortune started in cement shack 55 years ago

something-different than some-
one else,” he said.

The event exposed students,
as well 1+1‘; the University com-
munity, to an innovator who
entered a simple industry and
took his abilities and changed
the industry completely, ac-
cordingﬁto Anne Dugan, assis-
tant dean and executive direc-
tor of IEE.

“We really just wanted to
teach students how businesses
start and grow, how hard it is,
how long it takes and what it
takes to succeed,” Dugan said.

Raftis, who has more than
50‘ patents in the United States

and overseas — mostly in the

water and sewage industry —
discussed how he believes one
can successfully start and sus-
tain a company.

The ﬁrst step is reviewing
your own qualiﬁcations. An
entrepreneur must have an ac-
tive imagination and must pur-
sue his ideas — this is what led
Raftis to success in the valve

 

 

equipment industry, he said.
“When I looked at a two

inch valve, I actually saw a 24-

inch one,” he said, citing the

importance of innovation and.

an open mind.

According to Raftis, 90 per-
cent of start—up businesses fail
within the ﬁrst year, and 45
percent fold after ﬁve years.

Raftis associates this high
failure rate with too much dis-

cretionary spending and lack of

persistence.

“If you are sitting in a job
you do not like, just get up and
leave because the only way to
be successful is to have dedica-
tion,” he said. ' p .

Students attended the event
in hopes of learning about en-
trepreneurial ’ success from
Raftis’ personal experiences.

“I really- wanted: to .hear the
back—story, especially because
he was ﬁred for doing a good
job,” Pitt senior Banke Owoeye
said, referring to Raftis losing
his ﬁrst job at a pipe manufac-

“me Umvaasxrv or PITTSBURGH,
STUDENT GOVERNMENT BOARD

turing company.
From such lectures, Raftis
hopes to give studentsvsome di-

rection -— in the way that a men- ' '

tor had once done for him, ul-
timately leading him to pursue
pipe fabrication. '

“When you are young, you

‘don’t know much but you have
a lot of avenues to choose .

from,” he said.

Raftis started his business»

55 years ago in a cement shack
without i the ﬁnancial means
to expand, and today the Red
Valve Company has become
one of the world’s largest
manufacturers and suppliers of
pinch valves and the preferred
supplier for municipalities and
industrial plants worldwide, the
company’s website maintains.

Students hope to ‘apply the
same drive in their future en-
deavors.

“I am not only going to read
the book he wrote but also ap-
ply persistent want to succeed
and dedication,” Owoeye said.

   

Businessman and inventor Spiros Raftis talked to students at the
Athletic Association yesterday about how to be innovative in business.

More than two weeks after a minor leak

water. ,

Ofﬁcials have now secured a contrac-

Bill Dreibelbis, manager of health and en-

The contractor has expencnce. working in
nuclear facilities and will work on both the
north and south ends of the reactor pool.

Dreibelbis said the leak is not harmful
to the Penn State community or the people

Center. A A

” Test results have shown the water to be
“signiﬁcantly below federal drinking water
standards,” according to a press release.

“It’s not considered a health risk at all at

I this point,” Dreibelbis said, adding that it I

won’t become a health risk because of the
low radiation levels. “The radiation level is
just above the drinking water standard. By

would not even be a measurable quantity

At about 1 a.m., ofﬁcers informed crowd

fellow fans, that they were assembled il-

“For any crowd of ﬁve or. more armed or

A lot of the crowds were people being un-

them for everybody’s safety.”

In 2004, "police resorted to using pellet
guns to control crowds following the Red
Sox’ victory over the New York Yankees in

but police did not use such tactics this year.

In the celebrations following the Red

(U -WIRE) LOS AN GELES — The Los

fake clusters of dynamite were found in a
car Monday.

The fake explosives were found to be
part of a suicide bomber Halloween cos-

tume belonging to an Army recruiter work—_

A 911 call at about 12:45 p.m. reported

a suspicious object inside the vehicle in the .

initial ofﬁcer responding to the scene called
the bomb squad, which opened the car door
with a Slim Jim after visually identifying the
objects as fake explosives, Detective J. Chu

The majority of the parking lot remained
closed for about an hour.

“In this day and age, if youlook suspi-
cious with wires sticking out of your back-
pack, ﬁrst responders are taught to take
a head shot,” Chu said. “First responders
have to take these things very seriously.” i

DeSantis draws

DeSantis, page 1

stroyed in the ﬁre.

“We can rebuild this city
like [Howard] did,” he said.
“In an entirely different way,
but we can do it.”

V DeSantis’s plan is based on
reducing the cost of govem—
ment and reducing taxes -
“We are horribly taxed,” he
said — while still being able to
pay the bills. .

The goal of the plan is to
reduce government costs by 1
percent each year for the next
ﬁve years — without layoffs.
“We have to do more with
less,” DeSantis said.

“My opponent proposed a
budget that projects a deﬁcit,”
he said. “You only do that as a
joke or you get ﬁred.” V

DeSantis, who hopes to have
raised more than $350,000

when his campaign is said and
done, has been endorsed by
The Pitt News and both of the
city’s major downtown papers,
and credits this support partly

to the diverse group he sur-
rounds himself with.

“I even have a communist
on my “campaign,” DeSantis
said. A

He confessed that his staff
doesn’t agree on everything -
they can’t talk about national
politics because “a ﬁst ﬁght
would break out.”

The simple fact that they all
have the same goal — pulling
the city out of its virtual bank-
ruptcy — makes it easy to see
eye-to-eye when it comes to
Pittsburgh.

‘‘I propose the modest goal
of having our city government
be engaged in its community,”
DeSantis said. V

His vision for alleviating
the ﬁnancial weight of the city
includes straying away from
development, big subsidies and
taxes. 4

When it comes to develop-
ment Downtown or elsewhere
in the city, DeSantis discour-

ages government spending.

“We’re broke,” he said,
pointing towards “neighbor-
hood—by—neighborhood devel-
opment” as a potential remedy
to this question. “This way, the
people on the receiving end
actually design the develop-
ment.” ‘

DeSantis suggested that the
government should stop being
a developer and hand govern-
ment property that isn’t in use
over to private businesses.

“When you get into the pri-
vate market as _a government,
you skew it,” he said.

And this theory includes
public transportation.

DeSantis said that there isan ,,
urgent need for a “public artery V

of transportation from Down-
town to Oakland,” but that the
problem always leads back to
the city’s lack of money.

“Direct economic contribu-
tion is not going to happen,” he
said.

_ In turn, he said, Pittsburgh
will become a more viable
place to live for college gradu-
ates.

“If there are no growing
businesses in this city, there’s
not much we can do to keep
you folks,” he said.

One idea is to let new busi-
nesses keep some money they
would normally be expected to
dish out to the government.

“I’m not going to write big
checks,” he said. “If that means
eliminating taxes _for new com-
panies, so be it.”

DeSantis said this would
have a “minimal impact” on
the city government.

Another plan that should
. affect city retention of college

students is DeSantis’s plan to
develop a program for minor-
ity-owned businesses, he said.

As for consolidation — com-

It would require starting from

Thomas_Greenﬁeld, an assistant sec- -

retary of the State Department’s Bureau

on a government team in partnership
with African leaders to end wars in six

One of those countries was Liberia,

which was rapt in civil war for 14 years.

In that same year, Greenﬁeld wit-

thousands of people were in line at 4

votes, electing the ﬁrst female president 2

of an African nation.
After the forum, students attended.
sessions on a variety subjects, including

U.S.-Africa relations, howto take ac-

tion in Darfur and African drumming.

At the session on Darfur, David
Rosenberg, of the Pittsburgh Darfur
Emergency Coalition, said this geno-
cide has mobilized more students than
any issue since the Vietnam War. He
challenged students who do not already
have a Darfur awareness group at their
schools to create one.

“When you see people are being

camps, what are you supposed to do

. about it?” Rosenberg asked.

Stacy Reader, a sophomore at Fox
Chapel Area High School, attended two"
previous World Affairs Council forums.
At one, she joined two of her classmates
to give apresentation on AIDS.

Reader recalled how, during the pre-
sentation, two representatives from Af-
rica became angry, interrupted them and
lectured them for not mentioning the
positive aspects of African society.’

“It just shows how much we only see
one side of Africa,” Reader said.

Pittsburgh was the third city to host
the Teach Africa program, following
Washington D.C. and San Francisco.
The Africa Society’s goal is to introduce
it in every state.

The youth forum was the third phase
of the program.'The ﬁrst phase encour-
aged school principals and superinten-
dents to introduce. more lessons about
Africa in their schools, and the second
phase trained teachers new strategies

“The trends are cyclic and students
should try to apply during those declin-
ing years because there is a smaller pool
of applicants.” .

applicants, McCall said, “Competition
was not as tight [this year], but we were
lucky our class was able to stillincrease
quality and minority admissions.” ' .4

First year Pitt Law -School student

(John Burns was surprised to learn that

applications were down for such a com-
petitive ﬁeld.

Burns said that he applied to at least
eight law schools. 0

Marietti clariﬁed that the decrease in
applicants does not correspond to a low-
er quality of admitted students. “

“Every year the overall caliber of ap-
plicants gets better so standards do not
need to lower,” he said.

Past records from the American Bar

Association show that these decline pe-
riods are usually temporary.

McCall said that there has been an in-
crease in the number of admission tests
taken and the number of attendees at law
school application forums -— an indica-
tor that admission levels could be on the
rise again soon. a

Blackwater immunity
grant negligent

Last month, the State Depart-
ment allowed the Federal Bureau
of Investigation to take over its
prosecution of the Blackwater USA
case surrounding a Sept. 16 “esca—
lation of force” incident in which
Blackwater security guards were
allegedly involved in the deaths
of 17 innocent Iraqi civilians. One
month later, the investigation has
proven to be a pointless farce.

According to The New York
Times, State Department investiga-
tors had made seemingly unauthor-
ized immunity offers to Blackwa-
ter guards. With the FBI currently
in control of the investigation, it
has been unable to use any of the
information found during the ques-
tioning process of the departrnent’s
Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

By law, only voluntary state-
ments can be used against govem—
ment workers in a criminal prose-
cution. However, if an employee is
forcibly required to answer under
risk of punitive action, the infor-
mation is worthless to the case.

State Department investigators
had to have known about this when
they granted the guards immunity.
They had to have known that the
responses gleaned could not be
used in the case. So, why didthe
investigators even bother to pros-
ecute, if they knew from the very
start that the supposed wrongdoers
would not face repercussions for
their actions? '

A law enforcement ofﬁcial told
the Washington Post that the im-
munity grants were meant to pro-
tect the jobs of the employees. But
if the statements could prove that
the Blackwater guards cannot law-
fully carry out their jobs, then they
obviously don’t deserve to keep
them.

It is true that, immediately fol-
lowing the Sept. 16 incident, the
State Department was under much
pressure to get to the bottom of the

12

controversy — so much pressure, it
seems, that the investigators failed
to act responsibly in their prosecu-
tion. ‘ I

But this is no excuse. The de-
p‘artment’s outstanding negligence
in handling the case is embarrass-
ing. And we’re not the only ones
who are frustrated with their care-
lessness.

The Iraqi government yester-
day approved a law that would
make foreign security companies
subject to prosecution for wrong-
doing. The Iraqi government is
trying to take control of this issue
because the United States is failing
at it. But, -unfortunately, as long as
the United States is the occupying ~,
power, the Iraqi government can-
not possibly have any force of law.

And so, regrettably, we seem to
be at a standstill. Part of the prob-
lem is that the American public ei-
ther does not know about the gravi-
ty of the Blackwater case or simply
does not care. In contrast to the up-
roar surrounding the Vietnam War
more than 30 years ago, Americans
today are apathetic about what hap-
pens to Iraqis overseas.

As cynical as it may seem, per-
haps more Americans would care
if the Iraqi death count were 370 as
opposed to 17. The devastating My
Lai massacre during the Vietnam
War resulted in the deaths of more
than 300 unarmed Vietnamese ci-
viliansby the U.S. 

After _the details of the massa-
cre reached the American public,

_demonstrations and protests rose

across the country. Eventually, the

—massacre was investigated and its

perpetrators punished.

While it is unfair, at this point,
to draw a comparison between the
Blackwater case and the My Lai
massacre, it is nonetheless impor-
tant to reﬂect upon the power of
the American public to push for

Bottled Water not as harmless as it seems

Plastic bottles hazardous for the
environment and your hankacconnt

     

by Colleen Seidel

Colmmzrbt

With all the talk about global warming and
the environment in the news today, I can’t say
I’ve been particularly persuaded to overtly
change my lifestyle. It’s just simply not one of
the ﬁrst things thatpop into my head when mak-
ing a decision.

Allowmetoclarifyhere:Idothinkthecare~

of the earth is an important issue. I’m not say-
ingglobalwarmingisn’tarealconcern,butIsee
it as another hot-button issue overblown by the
media to create a level of hysteria in the public in"
orderto raise ratings and sell particular items.

Reference point: CNN ’s recent marketing
fortheir special “Planet in Peril.” Even thetitle is
‘chosen speciﬁcally to evoke a sense of panic —
false panic. _

Irefusetogiveintothemedia—createdhys—
teria. I have, however, made one signiﬁcant en-
vironmentally related change in my life because
ofa report I heard on National Public Radio. I
have stopped buying bottled water. Completely.
No more Aquaﬁna for me.

Here’s why. According to Salt Lake City
mayor Rocky Anderson on the July 23, 2007
edition of Talk of the Nation, Americans bought
an estimated $11 billion worth of bottled water
last year. T

In the ﬁscal budget of the country, this _is pen-
ny change. The budget in 2006 for the Allegh-
eny County Health Department, which handles
municipal water, was $41,870,000, as 
on their website. Consider this for every county
inthe stateandthenevery stateinthenation,and
there’s no comparison.

What alarmed me about the bottled—water
ﬁgure, ﬂrough, is what’s behind it.

The plastic bottles sold in stores, holding the
same nutrient that comes from a faucet, are made
from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a non-re-
newable source. I’m not a scientist, but one of the

few things I remember from my environmental ‘

education in grade school is that anything that
starts with “poly” is synthetic. Synthetic materi-
als must be manufactured from something. One
of the main ingredients in manufacturing PET is
petroleum

That’s right. Americans bought $11 billion
worth of manufactured petroleurn-based bottles
todrinksomethingtheycangetforfree,orat
least something they pay for anyway.

Has anyone else noticed the price of gas

L lately?

Whenonebuysabottleofwatenheisnot
paying forthewater. Waterisfree. Instead,l1e
is payingufor what goes into putting the water
into the bottle, including the manufactrning and

14

V transportation costs, both of which involve the

use of petroleum .

So basically, when one buys a bottle of water,
he is paying for the use of petroleum to transport
a free entity contained in ‘ a petI'0leuI’n—baSed
product In other words, he’s paying for the use
of gas to transport something that, in its manu-
facturingprocess,also_usesgas.Thisrnearrsthat
weareusingtwotirnestheamorintofgastopay
for and obtain the same thing that has always
been available for free. Added to that, the NPR
bit held another piece of infomration that sur-
prised rne. Most of the water in bottles is simply
ﬁltered tap water. It’s no different than the water
you pour into your glass from a Brita pitcher.

In fact, tap water in municipalities is rnoni—
tored much rrrore closely in tenns ofpurity and
cleanliness than bottled water. Municipal public
works are required to test water quality three
times a day against Environmental Protection
Agency standards, and all of these testresults are
available to the public.

For instance, to check the quality of Allegh-
enyCounty’swater,allonehastodoisgotothe
Allegheny County Health Depanment website
and click on “Public Drinking Water.” To the
right of the screen are Water Quality Reports for
thediiferentareasofthecounty. Onecanalsoac—
cess information about water pollution controls
taken by the department.

It is a little harder, on the other hand, to ﬁnd
the same information about bottled water. For
one thing, the quality of bottled water is not mon-
itored by the EPA, but by theFood and DrugAd-
ministration because it is considered a food prod-
uct The FDA provides no speciﬁc requirements
for bottled water sources or the bottling process.

At this point, I’m thinking about bottling up
some of my own Brita-ﬁltered water and selling
it on the street. While bottling companies strug-
gle to sell  carbonated beverages in the midst
of the nation’s health craze, bottled water volume
saleshaveincreasedinthepastfewyearsand
continue to do so. ~

Infact, asreportedinanAugust2003 article
by Brian Howard, the U.S. News and World
Report revealed that the water for Aquaﬁna and
Dasani actually comes from ‘municipal water
sources. Aquaﬁna and Dasani also just so «hap-
pentobethetwotopsellingbrandsofbottled
water. '

All cheekiness aside, my point is this: Bot- ~

quite frankly, illogical. It makes no sense to me

vaccines and vitamins. We could wear doc-
tor’s masks and latex gloves, along with hair-
nets, safety goggles, kneepads and protective
jockstraps. I’d say that we could live in-a clear
bubble and play Trivial Pursuit, but it’s plastic
that got us into trouble in the ﬁrst place.

You could be extra safe, but that doesn’t
sound like it would be too much fun. In an
equally crazy answer to this problem, we
could just go completely nuts. >

Shooting over to the otherside of the spec-
trum like a human Cannonball at the circus,
we could rationalize that if everything can kill
you, why not live our lives to an unhealthy ex-
treme? ‘

If walking down the street can kill you,
why not run? If ﬂying in an airplane can be
dangerous,‘ why not Skydive? Ifeating ﬁsh can
give ‘you food poisoning, why not swim with
the sharks? .

Maybe if everything is bad, then nothing
really is. Coffee, while addictive and ﬁlled
witlrcaffeine, is also full of antioxidants and
might ease cirrhosis symptoms. Red wine

Danger is everywhere, even in
your seemingly innocent H20

might reduce gum disease and the chances of
developing Alzheimer’s disease. Pure choco-

. late may help clear arteries and increase blood

ﬂow. Even taking small doses of LSD have
been found to help cure alcoholism, though
possible side effects include, well, having
done LSD.

If danger is everywhere, there is no reason
not to stare it right in the face. I’m not saying
that we should go all go out and pierce our
tongues with rusty nails. But if bottled water
can really kill us, how much could that extra
hot fudge sundae really hurt?

If you want chocolate cake, then go eat
chocolate cake. If you like cigars better than
celery stalks, let everybody know. If you’d
rather watch the “Hogan Knows Best” mara-
tlrontlrangotothegym, sobeit. '

We’re all going to be gone some day, so we
might as well be happy while We’re here. Isn’t

A that the point of living?

Sharingmy mnhrella With her might just score me some eye contact. Alas, denied.
Wei Tang and Tony Leung Chiu star in the draxna, "Lust, Caution."

Aug Lee’s lustful,

cautionary tale

by Dan Vetanovetz
Staff Writer

 

Alternating between brutal and pitiable
character traits, “Lust, Caution” is a long-
winded tale that builds your expectations,
promises delivery and breaks them apart
before the end of the movie.

Set during World War II,“‘Lust, Cau-
tion” follows Wong Chia Chi (Wei Tang)
as she inﬁltrates Japanese puppet govem—
ment bureaucracy in China. Her big target
is Mr. Yee (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), who
progresses from a lower rung post to the
head of the Secret Service.

While Wong intends to simply gain ac-
cess to his compound by befriending his
wife, she ﬁinds that Mr. Yee’s attraction to
her can be used against him, and she be-
comes his rnistress. As she waits for her
comrades to move in, to her own fasci-
nated horror, her loyalties become torn.

Wong lived in Shanghai at the outset of
the war. Her father left for England with
her brother. Wong continues her studies
in Hong Kong, where she joins a drama
troupe with fellow students, led by Kuang
Yu Min (Lee-Horn Wang). Under Kuang’s

tutelage, Wong builds her acting skills, un-
til the perfect opportunity comes along -
a Contact on the inside.

The «group’s ﬁrst attempt on Mr. Yee
has unfavorable results, but Kuang knows
of Mr. Yee’s afﬁnitfy for Wong, and three
years later, he meets her in Shanghai,
where Mr. Yee has relocated, and convinc-
es her to ﬁnish the job.

The trailer for the movie was deceiving
- you expect a femme fatale whose inno-
cence is corrupted by war, and who must
sacriﬁce everything in the name of love.

The ﬁrst hour doesn’t show much of
this — it’s long and interspersed with mu-
sic in all the sentimentally correct places
but doesn’t descend to the level of making
the heroine stereotypically trapped by her
emotions. Don’t get too excited — the plot

‘ is nothing terribly new at this point.

The second hour changes this. The char-
acters gain more credibility. Steadily de-
picted as youthful and naive at the outset,
Kuang expresses it best when he reunites
with Wong in Shanghai and expresses that
they were just children in Hong Kong.

Although Wang’s acting isn’t spectacu-
lar, Tang does an excellent job in her role
of not only Wong, but also as her alter ego
Mak Tai Tai. She must alternate between
the shy and reserved Wong and the spir-
ited and aggressive Mak.

Tony Leung practices his mild-man-
nered style reminiscent of parts in Wong
Kar Wai’s ﬁlms, but this gives way to a vi-
cious denizen of the espionage underworld

Eggers and
Deng raise
awareness

by Colleen Seidel
Staﬁ’ W/riter

 

It was standing room only Monday

night in the intimate New Hazlett The-
ater as Dave Eggers and his collabora-

' tor Valentino Achak Deng discussed the

events behind “What is the What,” Egg-
ers’ most recent book. _

But while it was Eggers’ name that
drew the sell-out crowd to the lecture,
it was undoubtedly Deng who held the
captivation of the audience with his per-
sonal stories and memories of his life’s
journey.

Eggers’ latest work tells a story close-
ly based on the life of Deng, a Sudanese
“Lost Boy,” who was forced from his
home in the village of Marial Bai in
southern Sudan by civil war.

He wandered amid the refugee camps
of Ethiopia and,Kenya for 13 years until

E6 i the running for

longest album title

by Alison Smyth
Staﬁ’ Writer

  

What do you getwhen you combine
synthesizers, split—persona1ity vocals,
lyrics that hardly make sense and some
killer nicknames?

Electric Six, of course. The six band
members each boast a stage name that
matches the band’s'outlandish style. _

On vocalsis Dick Valentine, on guitar
are The Colonel and Johnny Na$hinal,
with Smorgasbord on bass, Tait Nucleus?
on synthesizers and Percussion World on
drums. ‘

Out of Detroit, these true-rock artistes
embrace their scattered and ‘nonsensical
lyrics and back them with an array of in-

vstrumental. and vocal styles.

You may know the band from hits,
such as “I Buy The Drugs” or “Danger!
High Voltage!” With the band’s latest
album, I Shall Exterminate Everything
Around Me That Restricts Me from Being
the Master, its craft is taken to another
level.

If nothing else, Electric Six is probably

title. Thankfully, the band has provided
listeners with more than album titles for
their enjoyment.

" The band’s front man, Dick Valentine,
pens some interesting tales that may con-

, fuse the public, but ‘somehow, the non— .

sense comes together with his vocals and
some strategically placed synthesizers to
create works of musical genius — well,
perhaps not “genius” per se, but deﬁnite-
ly music that gets the toes tapping and
-moods lifted. D
How can one not be utterly intrigued
by the mash—up of warped lyrics and
Both perplexing and noteworthy is
“Showtime,” which urges listeners to
“Put a little mustard on it” and “Put some
mustard on that mustard,” thus ending
the age-old question of whether to use
mustard or ketchup. A
When Electric Six is not answering all
of the important questions, it’s molding
its listeners into perfect citizens. In “Rip
It,” Valentine urges, “Be Nova Scotian,”
one of the many commands at the end of
“Rip It” that really do not make much
sense, only related by their rhymes.
Some lyrics seem to say, “See how
many words I can rhyme? Songwriting is
easy.” Despite the zany, oftenincoherent
lyrics, the end results are humorous com-
positions that are sure to put a smile on
your face. Then again, this is common-

the work, both Deng and Eggers re-
turned to southern Sudan and Marial Bai
in 2003. The main focal points of the
lecture were slides and short movie clips
of Deng and Eggers’ trip — the pair dis-
cussed the political, economic and so-
cial situations of a country disrupted by
25 years of war.

Because he had to ﬂee at such a young
age, Deng explained that “I never had
the chance to see the immediate destruc-
tion of war. I never asked about people
I knew before '[I left] because I knew the
answer would be ‘They’re dead.”’

Eggers continuously emphasized that
the current publicized conﬂict in Dar-
fur is related, but it is not the same-as
the war in southern Sudan that affected
Deng and his family.

After returning from the trip, they
both agreed that the proceeds from the
book would go toward helping.to im-
prove education for the Sudanese peo-
ple. The two established the Valentino
Achak Deng Foundation to begin build-

- ingvsecondary schools ‘in Marial Bai and

the surrounding areas.

I UPMC lea °:::ea

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

Eggers said that he had promised
Deng the book would be ﬁnished within
a year, originally foreseeing a late 2003,‘,
release date.

“I failed miserably at that,” Eggers
joked. “I know some people need dead-
lines — that’s not the right kind of dead-
line,” he said, alluding to Marial Bai im-
provements contingent on his ﬁnishing
the book. .

Eventually, Eggers ﬁnished and the
book was released in late 2006. It has
received critical acclaim and is currently
a New York Times bestseller.

Interestingly enough, Monday night’s
lecture brought Eggers back to Pitts-
burgh for the second time in less than
two weeks, as he accepted this year’s
Heinz Award in the Arts and Humani-
ties at a ceremony last week at the John
Heinz History Center. £1.

The prize, one of six, is given by the
Heinz Family Foundation every year to
individuals who contribute remarkable
achievements to the improvement of
humanity, according to the foundation’s
website.

We are left to wonder what exactly is
going on inside the lead characters’ heads.
Answers are not forthcoming, and this is
what makes things exciting. How does
Wong feel toward her target and fellow
resistance members who are keeping her
in this situation?

It’s nerve wracking to see her suffer at
Mr. Yee’s hands. There is one point where
they are in bed, but all Wong can look at is

Mr. Yee’s handgun across the room. You

Wong explodes in front of her com-

she keeps it together enough to continue.

about apocalyptic pink ﬂamingos and

Songs are accompanied by a variety of
instruments, including piano, saxophone
and clarinet. No two tracks are alike,
ranging from ’70s era disco style with
falsetto vocals to new-wave style with
super ’80s synthesizers to the pure rock

of today.

“Broken Machine” is heavy on the
synthesizers with electric guitars that
bring itto the 21st century.

“Fabulous People” addresses the me-
dia’s obsession with stars and the little
people that fuel their domination of the
world.

Accompanied by a dance beat, this
statement becomes quite fabulous, itself.
“I Don’t Like You” features guitar solos

highlighting “the thrill of philanthropy,”
and after discussing Eggers’ non—proﬁt
young writers’ workshop, 826 Valencia,
claimed that the novelist had both “art
and heart.”

Eggers is probably best known for his
autobiographical ﬁrst novel “A Heart-
breaking Work of Staggering Genius.”
The story tells of his experiences raising
his younger brother after both of his par-
ents died less than a month apart from

“What is the What”:

one another.

Indeed, there were many worn cop-
ies of the book at Monday night’s book
signing following the lecture.

But it’s Eggers latest project, along with
Deng, that received all the attention and
impressed the most importance upon the

crowd Monday night.

For those interested, more informa-
tion on the project is available at www.

At a time when the idea of global
citizenship is becoming increasingly

important, people like Deng serve the

march of progress by bridging national
and cultural gaps in order to help their
disadvantaged countrymen.

“I was never burdened by the war in
Sudan the way I was burdened by my
trip [back] to Marial Bai,” Deng said. ‘fl

them.”

Williams Winds Pitt’s Wheels
      

Five years ago, the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball program was shattered - lying
dormant at the bottom of the Big East.

So when Agnus Berenato left Georgia
Tech to revive Pitt, she knew there was
considerable work to be done.

She said her goodbyes, packed her
bags and headed to Pittsburgh. 1

But she was missing something big.
Something she couldn’t pack into a car-
ry—on bag or throw into her moving van.

5 That something was actually some-
one. That someone was Jeff Williams.

Williams, now heading into his sec-
ond season as the Pitt women’s associate
head coach andﬁfth as an assistant to Be-
renato, worked on Berenato’s coaching
staff at Georgia Tech for two years when
she asked him to follow her to Pittsburgh
to help pick up the pieces of Pitt’s strug-
gling program.

And if Williams hadn’t accepted,
those pieces may still very well still be

“He was the only coach that I wanted
to bring with me to Pittsburgh,” Ber-
enato said. “I didn’t have anyone else in
mind.”

Entering his ﬁfth year at Pitt, Williams
has complemented Berenato’s coaching
skill with a comparable vision of success,
developing into an integral part of a pro-
gram that’s rapidly on the rise.

A great recruiter, Williams has brought
in some of the Big East’s best ’

Williams sets ‘em up, Berenato knocks ‘em down

The dynamic duo of Pitt associate head coach Jeff Williams and Pitt  coach Agnus Berenato
(front) has propelled Pitt wornenslaaslietball to new ground. Wﬂliams is Berenato’s main recruiter.

“He’s like a preacher,” Berenato said. [players],” Zellous said. “We really be-
“He has ‘so much wisdom for the youth of
today. He’s really a great educator.”

His players agree.

“Honestly, he’s a dad to all of us

lieve in him, and he believes in us.”
Williams also works hard with the post
players —- something that really shows in

  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
   
   
   
   
  
   
 
   
   
 
  
   
 
  

few years, including
Marcedes Walker and
Shavonte Zellous (both
pre—season All-Big East
team selections).

“-‘- Redshirt senior Mal-
lorie Winn, who has re-
ceived numerous awards
and recognition, even followed
him to Pitt from Georgia Tech.

Berenato said that as a coach

{and a recruiter, Williams is irre-

placeable.

But it’s not just his‘
knowledge of the game that g3
puts him a notch above the ;
rest, it’s his ability to relate ‘

tial weapons on both
sides of the court.

“He was really -hard
on me as far as playing
and getting in shape,”
Walker said. “But he’s
improved my whole
career. He wants us
to be the best we can
be.”

Williams said that
watching the players
grow mentally and ma-
ure as people is just
s important as their
growth on the court.

Girardi
would have
been nice

by Zack Chakan .
Staff Wr/fer

I was all prepared to lay out the reasons .

and arguments for hiring Joe Girardi as
the next manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Excitement tickled my insides at the op-
portunity. .

So of course, the New York Yankees
decide on Monday to offer Girardi their
vacant position of manager, which he is
expected to take. My excitement reversed
to anger and despair.

Damn Yankees. Again.

But all is not lost. The Pirates still have
to hire a manager and were likely not to
lure the 2006 National League Manager
of the Year, anyway. The job is completely
upfor grabs, and there have been varying
reports on who the frontrunners are and
even who is just interested in the job.

It’s not like Pittsburgh has competition
anymore. The Pirates are the sole remain-
ing club that hasn’t hired a manager after
having a vacancy following the regular

Pitt's season
by]l;Iike.Gladysz 1 P

It was a tale of two halves for the Pitt
women’s soccer team this season, and it
ended in a tough way over the weekend
at Founders Field.

Pitt dropped a 2-1 decision to Mar-‘
quette on Friday night, then capped off a
dreadful second half of its season with a
0-0 double—overtime tie against the South
Florida Bulls.

After a strong start, the Panthers were
6-31 and on the track to the Big East tour-
nament. They couldn’t establish consis-

grow into adults and productive citizens,”
he said.

In order to build an effective program,
Williams only recruits players who will
grow both physically and mentally, and ﬁt
the mold Coach Berenato is looking for.

“It’s important to recruit kids that your
head coach is comfortable with. That’s
when you see the most growth,” Williams
said.

Before coming to Pitt, Williams
brought top—10 and top-15 recruiting
classes at Georgia Tech, and a top-12 _re—
cruiting class at Howard.

He was also the head coach for the At-

ilanta Justice, winning the National Wom-

en’s Basketball League title in 2001.

Berenato is grateful that Williams has
such an understanding of what the pro-
gram needs, and what she personally is
looking for.

“He’s one of the best recruiters in the
country,” Berenato said.

“He understands what I want in a play-
er, and if they don’t ﬁt into my system, he
knows I’m not interested. He only brings
to me the total student-athlete.”

Because of the constant work and com-

Chakan: Tony Pena is  

the man for the Pirates

Chakan, page 22 '
season. Pirates general manager Neal
Huntington has yet to even interview a
candidate.

Huntington has rationalized this as
an act of respect to Major League Base-
ball, so no major announcements would
come out during the World Series (cough,
cough, Alex Rodriguez). This also means

- he intends to bring in some coaches from

the ﬁnal four teams in the playoffs for in-
terviews.

However, my desired candidate for the
job wasn’t a part of those ﬁnal four teams.
He hasn’t managed in over two years, but
he was on the staff of one of the playoff
teams. . .,

It makes me shudder to say this‘, but he
was a coach for the Yankees this past sea-
son. No, it’s not Don Mattingly. T -

My main man is Tony Pena.

He isn’t much of a homer pick, al-
though he played for the Pirates a few
years in the 19805. Some have called for
current coaches and former Pirates Jay
Bell and Andy Van Slyke to manage the
team, but I still blame Van Slyke for the
departure of Barry Bonds from Pittsburgh,
so I could never fathom such a move.

The key here is experience. Pena played
18 years in the majors and is the lone can-
didate with managerial experience.

He led the Kansas City Royals for over
three seasons and headed the squad that
went 83-79 in 2003. That was the only
time Kansas City has breached .500 since
1994.

Oh, and he won American League
Manager of the Year that season also. Not
bad, huh?

Pena has to be disappointed that he was
passed over by the Yankees. He coached
ﬁrst base for New York this year and was
one of three who interviewed for the spot.
George Steinbrenner’s son Hank said that
Pena'had a real chance for the job. I’m
glad he wasn’t offered,it.

Conﬁdence and enthusiasm deﬁne Pe-.
na’s personality and managerial style. He
is also known as being a great motivator
on the ﬁeld and in the clubhouse. All of
these characteristics ﬁt the proﬁle of Hun-
tington’s and new Pirates president Frank
Connelly’s next leader.

Former Pirates manager Jim Tracy
lacked those traits and was promptly
shown the door.

Developing talent was another discrep--
ancy of Tracy’s, but Pena fared much bet-
ter in his tenure at Kansas City.

His 2003 seaso’n in Kansas City fea-
tured breakout seasons from Carlos Bel-

26 The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

tran and Raul Ibanez and a Rookie of the
Year in Angel Berroa. The pitching was
old and terrible, but the Royals still man-
aged to win 83 games. His record the next
two seasons wasn’t pretty, but that was
aided by management’s decision to over-
haul with over-the—hill veterans and wide-
eyed rookies.

Sources have been naming Red Sox
pitching coach and former Indians execu-
tive John Farrell as the favorite, with In-
dians third base coach Joel Skinner close
behind. .

Both are afﬁliated with Huntington,
who used to work in the Cleveland organi-
zation as assistant general manager and an
advance scout. V

But is going with what you are famil-
iar with the best idea? Former Pirates GM
Dave Littleﬁeld worked with Tracy and
scouting director Ed Creech in Montreal,
so he brought them to Pittsburgh with high
hopes, and failed miserably with each at
the helm.

Of course, Littleﬁeld was a bumbling,

incompetent fool as an executive. It seems
like Huntington knows what he is doing.
It’s a bit tough to compare the two.

The truth is you have to go with the
best man for the job. The cost of choosing
Pena should not be a big issue, because he
can be hired for a similar salary to what
Tracy made. 0

Tracy had just left the Dodgers when
the Pirates hired him and didn’t burden the
payroll. Pena’s experience and desire lift
him a notch above the other candidates,
so much so that Huntington should chase
him no matter the price.

If Pena happens to not be interested,
Farrell may be a good second choice. Just
look at what the Boston pitchers accom-
plished in the World Series.

The Pirates Triple-A afﬁliate manager

‘Trent Jewett is worth a look as well. He’s

spent time on the big leagues staff in Pitts-
burgh and is also lauded as a great com-
municator and developer of talent.

But for the complete package, Pena has
to be the guy — as long as he renounces
his association to the Yankees, of course.

The only better option possesses all of
Pena’s qualities, except that he’s managed
in Pittsburgh before. In fact, he led a team
to the World Series last year, and he has a
World Series ring  and he was available
before the 2006 season. He even stated that
he wanted to manage the Pirates again.

Oops. Jim Leyland manages Detroit
now. Neverrnind. I hate you Dave Little-
ﬁeld.

iency, however, going winless in their
last nine to ﬁnish the season at 6-10-2
overall and 1-8-2 in the Big East.

The Panthers will have a lot to look
forward to next year, though, as they
graduate just three seniors from a squad
brimming with young talent.

Sophomore Ashley Habbel, who led
the Panther offense throughout the sea-
son, will return to head what should be
a strong and driven Panther attack next

’fall.
 Pitt head coach Sue-Moy Chin said 4

that with more experience, the team as a

whole will be much improved.

“We’ve learned a lot this year,” Chin
said. “I’m really excited about the future

~ of this program.” ,

 Even with a disappointing end, Chin
said she was proud of the seniors and the
team.

“They’ve kept their heads up,” she

said. “They’ve kept battling all year,
long.” '

 Marquette 2, Pitt 1
In hostile conditions on a mud—cov—

ered ﬁeld, the Panthers couldn’t quite’

ﬁnd their traction as they came out onthe
wrong side of a hard-fought battle against
‘Marquette on Friday night. .
Marquette struck early in -the ninth
minute when a beautiful cross from the
left side found Golden Eagle Michelle
Compty, who lofted a header deep into
the corner of the net past diving Pitt goal-
keeper Morie Kephart. ' i ‘
Pitt’s defense held the rest of the half,
but its offense couldn’t establish much of

anything, registering zero shots on goal. '

The Golden Eagles capitalized early
in the second half when the muddy con-
ditions led to a key Pitt turnover. '

"l“ Immediately after a throw in, Mar- I

quette’s Allison Mallams took a scream-
ing cross from the right side and launched
it past'Kephart to give Marquette a 2-0
lead. A

‘ '‘ Freshman Laura Berbert nearly put

Pitt on the board in the 86th minute, but
her free kick sailed just over the net and
the score remained 2-0.

Pitt continued to battle, though, and
Jennifer Kritch scored just one minute
later for the Panthers off an Ashley Hab-
bel cross. ’

The Panthers kept up their inten-
sity and hustle, creating several scoring
chances in the last couple minutes, but
couldn’t convert as the game drew to a
close. -

After being out-shot 7-3 in the ﬁrst half
and posting no shots on goal, Pitt out-shot
Marquette 8-4 in the second half, putting

four of those chances net. “Our effort was '

really good,” Chin said. “We played hard.
We just had a few mental lapses.”

Pitt 0, South Florida 0 t

On‘ senior recognition day, Pitt looked
to break its eight-game winless streak
and end the season with a bang.

Despite inspired play and several scor-
ing chances, the Panthers couldn’t get
on the board, ending the ‘year with a 0-0
double-overtime deadlock against South

Pitt football coach Dave Wannstedt (right) stands-with injured Pitt lineman Jason
Pinkston before Pitt's 24-17 win over Cincinnati on Oct. 20. Wannstedt ﬁnds out
today if he can have the stitches removed from his surgically repaired foot. If he does,
Wannstedt plans to return to Pitt's sidelines after two Weeks of sitting in the press box.

Helping the program is a
family effort for Williamses

Williams, page 25

mitment, the Panthers went from just six
wins in the 2003-2004 season to 24 wins
and their ﬁrst NCAA tournament win last
year.

Then, just last weekend, they were
picked to ﬁnish fourth in the Very com-
petitive Big East.

“In the Big East we have athletic
teams and we have power teams,” Wil-
liams said.

“You never know what you’re going

to get each night, you really have to pre-
pare.”
Pitt gets help not only from Williams,

but from his entire family as well.

“My wife is probably the loudest per-

son in the arena,” Williams said.

His son, McCoy Zachary, already
sports the Pitt jumpsuit’ to show his sup-
port at just six months old.

“He’ll be a big guard, he’s already got

‘big hands,” Williams said. ‘‘He’ll be _a

linebacker, too.”

As a family man and a coach, Ber-
enato can’t‘ say enough about’ Williams’
importance to the program.

“I trust him literally with my entire

- program, with my soul, with my heart,”

she said.

But even with all of the respect and
admiration his players and coaches give
to him as a coach and a mentor, they’re
not ready to give it to him on the court.

Walker, Zellous and Berenato all said
that in a game of one—on—one, they’d
come out on top against the formeriHow-
ard guard.

“I’d take him,” Walker said.

Williams was surprised.

“Take me where?” he said, laughing.
“I don’t think all three of them together
could take me.” f

Either way, Williams will continue to
teach and inspire his players on and off
the court, and the program will reap the
beneﬁts.
