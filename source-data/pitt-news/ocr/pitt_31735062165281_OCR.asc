St, Patrick? s Arrival

To Highlight Activity

By DORSEY FORTINI

St. Patrick, patron saint of the engineers, will arrive to-'

morrow to highlight the third annual Engineers’ Week at
the University of Pittsburgh. Among the dignitaries partici-
pating in the arrival will be David L. Lawrence, Mayor of
Pittsburgh; General Matthew B. Ridgway, now chairman
of the Board of Trustees at Mellon Institute; Dean of the
School of Engineering and Mines, Dr. G. R: Fitterer, and
Colonel William D. Eister, head of the Reserve Officers Train-

ing Corps.

In 1954, when Pitt ﬁrst assumed the celebration of En-
gineers’ -'Week, St. Pat arrived on the campus via a dump

truck. Last year,St. Pat hopped¢

out of a helicopter waving shille-
laghs especially ﬂown from Ireland
through the courtesy of Trans-‘
World Airlines. “St. Pat’s arrival
this year,” according to general
chairman Tom Ta-rolli,_Ind. Eng.
’57, “will be a neat little package
of surprises.”

Props, too, are out of the ordi-

Harper Voted President
In IF Election Surprise

By AL DONALSON .

An upset win-was registered at the Inter-fraternity Coun-
cil elections, lastweek at the Delta Sigma Phi house, when
Reed Harper, Col. ’57, was elected IF President.

Harper, whohad the support of the_All_-Pitt Party fac-
tion of Council, is a member of Phi Gamma Delta, a fraternity
associated with the Panther party.

. IF Secretary Larry Miller had been expected to be elect-
ed president, but the representatives of Phi Gamma Delta evi-
All-Pitt Party to provide the margin

dently voted with the
needed for Harper to win.
Some ranking members of the
Panthers think that Harper’s
election is- the result of some
‘political maneuvering by the.All-
Pitt party. According to Pan-'
ther Party Chairman Lynn Wat-
son, “Harper was probably ap-
proached by the All-Pitt Party
‘and made, some. sort of deal
-with them. It’s obviously a case
of selﬁshness on the part of
Reed. I think it's the rottenest
political deal ‘ever to occur at
Pitt.” . -

Ted ‘Jamison, chairman of the
All-Pitt Party, said last week that
“some of‘ our boys" saw Reed and
told him that .we would support
him if he in turn would support
Bob Lancaster for Vice-
President.' . .

‘Best Man-for Office’

‘.‘Reed said that. he couldn’t
promise us his support for Lan-
caster because he thought he was-
morally bound to the Panthers,

C _but that he was willing to run if

we would support him. That was
okay with uslthough, because we
thought he was the best man fo
the office,” Jamison said. - —

Meanwhile, the Phi Gains’ fu-

uncertain at the present. Ac-
cording to Watson, the Panthers
probably won’t have “anything
to do with the Phi Gains.”

Don Underwood, newly elected-
president of the, Phi Gams, said
that .“we didn’t make any deals
with the All-Pitts and we didn’t
bolt the Panther Party. Our man
was runningfor oﬂice and we
voted for him. I don’t see why
the fellows are all excited about

Panthers’ Retain Eastern Titles-
lV[ermen _V7in ECSA
Fifth Straight Year

BY JAN SWENSEN .
- -The Panther swimmers displayed strong team depth by
dominating the Eastern Collegiate Swimming Association
championships for the ﬁfth consecutive time, Friday and

Saturday in New York.

The ﬁns rolled up 139 points to out—distance their closest
competitor, Lehigh, who wound up with 71 points.

Ben Grady’s squad took ten ﬁrsts out of 13 events, losing

only the 200-yard butterﬂy and¢
the high and low board diving.

freestyles, Jim
Zurcher broke
two -records.
Zurcher took
t h e 2 2 O i n
2214.2 for a New
Y‘ o 1' k Univer-
sity pool rec-
ord, and he
swam the 440
in 4‘: 56.9 to
s m a s h t h e
ECSA standard
that he set in 1954.

The tankers took -control of
the meet in the first events. The
Gradymen took 61 points on the
ﬁrst day to Lehigh’s 46. Lou
Durbin started the victory pa-
rade by copping the 50-yard,
freestyle. . Team captain Skip
Monsein followed Durbin by
tak_ing the 200-yard backstroke.
He took the 100-yard backstroke
on the second day of the meet.

The Panthers continued to mass,
points by winning four places in
the 220-yard freestyle. In the low
board diving Bert Marks placed
second, and Milo Fisher was ﬁfth.
Fisher took fourth on the high
board, and Marks was sixth.

Middle distance runner Arnie
Sowell broke on_e record himself
and then led the seemingly in-
vincible mile relay team to victory
in a record-setting pace last week-
end. Sowell copped his fourth ma-
jor win in indoor track Saturday
night when he set a new Milwau-
kee Journal meet record in the
1,000 yard run——2:l0. A

It was, however, 1.8 seconds off
the world indoor standard he now
holds jointly with Milwaukee’s
Don Gehrmann.

Relay teammate Perry Jones
‘opened up the lead in the two-
mile relay for the Panthers. With
a ten--yard lead he handed the
baton to Sowell who so far out-
distanced competitors that he won
by 80 yards. The teamset a new-
meet record of 7135.2, only 1.4
seconds off the world record. Un-
officially, Sowell was timed at
1:49.6. ‘ -

Magazine Bowl P011  

By CHRIS
A No one, with the possible

GILLOTTI
exception of the football team,

is happier than the student body over a bowl bid. However,

the “overemphasis,” question

is often raised‘ and recently

college presidents were polled on their feelings about foot-
ball and bowl bids in particular.

Newsweek Magazine polled the
presidents of the colleges involved
in the four major bowl games [last

“plan. 2. Only one, Dr. George L.
1 ”Cross of Oklahoma, indicated any

opposition to piost-season bowls. ,

Pitt’s ‘acting Chancellor, Charles
B. Nutting, stated, “The Sugar
Bowl invitation came as a: sur-

prise to us and we accepted with— ’

out feeling we were selling our-
selves down the river. . . . The
ﬁnancial_ return was very wel-
come.” V ‘
I Captain Tom Hamilton, Pitt Di-
rector of Athletics, in an inter-
.view with Pitt News, gave his
complete approvalto bowl games.
“Well conducted and well estab-
lished bowl games" have a place in
a college sport scene,” Hamilton
asserted. “All who take part. bene-
,ﬁt, because all the income de-
rived is used exclusively for stu-
dents and faculty.”

""“ll?"}:J‘rom the attitudes expressed,

today’s college presidents are
ﬁrmly behind their athletic pro-
gram. It’s a far cry from the day,
in 1881, when .the president of

A THUMPING BIG succns
ON CAMPUS ‘I

6 While up in the attic last week_hiding from a bill collector I
came across a letter, yellow now with age, that dear old Dad had
sent me when I was a freshman. I read the letter again and
recalled, with many a sigh and nota few tears,.what an inspira-

How To BE

tion it had been to me back in my’freshman days. I reproduce it » '

below in the hope that it may light your way as it did mine.

\“Dear Son, (Dad always called me Son. This was short for

~ Sonnenberg, which was originally my ﬁrst name. I later traded '
it with aman named Max. He threw in two outﬁelders and a left- ‘

handed pitcher . . . But I digress.)

“Dear Son, (Dad wrote)

“I suppose you are ﬁnding’ college very bigand bewildering,
and maybe a little frightening too. Well, it need not be that
way if you‘will follow a few simple rules.

“First of all, if you have any problems, take them to your
teachers. They want to help you. That’s what they are there for.
Perhaps they do seem rather aloof and forbidding, but that is
only because they are so busy. You will ﬁnd your teachers warm

as toast and friendly as pups if yo will call on them at an hour _

when they are not overly busy. Fo r a.m., for instance.
“Second, learn to budget your time. What with classes, activi-
ties, studying, and social life all competing for_your‘t§:me, it is
easy to fallinto sloppy habits. You must set up a rigid schedule
and stick to it. Remember, there are only 24 hours in ;a day.
Three of these hours are spent in class. For every hour in class,
you must, _of course, spend two hours studying: So there go six
more ho'urs. Then, as ‘everyone knows, for every hour of study-
_ing, you must spend two hours sleeping. That accounts for an-

- other twelve hours. Then there are meals—-two hours each for
breakfast and lunch, three hours for dinner. Never forget, Son-Z

nenberg, you must chew each mouthful 288 times. You show
me a backward student, and I'll show you a man who bolts
his food. , ' ‘
“But college is more than just sleeping,” eating, and studying.
There are ‘also many interesting and broadening activities, and
you would be cheating yourself if you neglected them. You’ll
want to give at least an hour a day to the campus newspaper and

I ' yearbook, and, of course, another hour each to the dramatic and

music clubs. And let’s say a total of three hours daily to the
stamp club, the foreign affairs club, and the debating society.
Then, of course, a couple of hours for fencing and bird-walking,
‘a couple more for square dancing and basket weaving, and one
‘or two for cribbage and ice-sculpturing. ’

' “Finally, we come to the most important part of each day-—what

' I call"The.Quiet Time.’ This is a peri_od in which you renew_ 

_yoursel'f—y'ust relax and thinlc green thoughts and smoke Philip’
Morris Cigarettes. I ‘ 

    

natural 'comple-.
ment to an active life; they are gentle, they are benign, they
are tranquil, they are a treat to thetired, a boon to the spent, a
haven to the storm-tossed. That’s why.‘ .

“Well, Sonnenberg, I guess that’s about all. Your mother sends ’

, her love. She" has just‘ ﬁnished putting up rather a large batch

of pickles—in fact, 350,000 jars. I told her thatiwith you away

1 at school,.we would not need so many, but lovable old Mother

is such a creature of habit that though I hit her quite hard
several times, she insisted ongoing "ahead. _ ,
