In Happy Valley 29- I4  

fir By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer

It was all Pitt Saturday as the
Panthers won the‘ Lambert Trophy.
with an impressive 29-14 beating of.
Penn State in a game not nearly as.
close as the ﬁnal score indicated.
It was a big win for Jackie Sherrill,
whohad to relish beating Paterno.

What made the victory -more
satisfying wasn't the win itself, but
rather the way it was won. Pitt,
and Randy McMillan, were simply
too strong for Penn State upfront,
and the physical dominance had to
be somewhat surprising to veteran
observers of the Pitt-Penn State
series, who have seen the Panthers
pushed and shoved around all too
many times. A

“Last year, after the game up
here, when our players came into
the locker room, they (made a vow
that they were gonna win this
year,” Jackie Sherrill said in the
jubilant Pitt locker room. “There’s
no question that this is the biggest
day of my coaching Cartier: W?
ﬁnally became number one in the
East after ‘76.«”

Paterno appeared a bit shocked
afterwards, and praised Pitt’s
efforts to no end. “I think Pitt
played an awfully ﬁne football
game,” said Paterno. “The score

could have been worse than it was,
and I was proud of our kids. They
hung inlthere tough, but we were
obviously outclassed today. Pitt
did a great job.”

Both coached agreed as_ to the
deciding factor in Pitt’§ surprising-
ly easy win. /'

“Pitt just dominated the line "of
scrimmage all day,” said Paterno.
“They knocked us off the ball, and
blocked us well. Pitt’s kids
(McMillan, DiBartola and Jbnes)
ran hard. -They obviously were

’ ready to play.”

Sherrill echoed Paterno’s
thoughts. “Our offensive line
dominated their d fensive line,”

Sherrillsaid. “I thought we’d have .

to dominate up front to win, and we
did.” '
Saturday also marked the return
of Pitt’s Big Mac Attack, as
fullback Randy McMillan, appar-
ently saving his best for‘ last,
‘burned the Penn State defense for
117 yards on 26 carries and two
bruising touchdowns. He also

caught two passes, the first one a_ ‘

screen pass in the second quarter

where he broke three or four‘

attempted arm and shoulder

tackles, and a 50-yard pass—run ,

play from Dan Marino in thepfourth

Plauditory statements were the
major content of Vice President
Walter F. Mnda1e’s weekend
address to members of the
Pennsylvania State Education
Association. .

‘Predictably, Mondale. gave
praise to the Carter administration
and educators, and he also had
positive remarks for Americans and
their reaction to the nearly
month-long jlranian crisis.

“In the face of unbelievable
provocation and insult, the Amer-
ican people have "acted quietly,
m_aturely and with respect and
restraint,” Mondale said to -the
capacity crowd gathered in the
Downtown Hilton/' ballroom on
Saturday. “I cannot remember a
time when the American‘ people
have been more united like a
family.” ‘

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer
HARRISBURG—Two university
faculty groups have yet to take a
stand on a controversial “Truth in
Testing” bill though the Educa-

tional Testing Service has already A

begun lobbying against it, accord-
ing to the executive""secretary‘of the
state division of the American
Association of University Profes-
sors (AAUP). .
“With certain issues it’s pretty
clear what the standpoint of our
groups will be, but on this one
there seems to be deﬁnite split,”
said R. David Tive, fulltime
lobbyist for both AAUP and the
Association on Pennsylvania State
College and University Faculties.

, “I’ve talked to people who are

vehemently opposed and vehe-
mently for the bill.”

Senate 994 was introduced to the
education committee in September
by Sen. James R. Kelley (D:
Westmoreland) and may‘signiﬁ-
cantly alter standardized testing
procedures, affecting a large
number of exams devised and
administed by Princeton, N.J.’s
“think tank”-—the Educational
Testing Service.

That nonprofit organization, as
well as the College Board Service
and American ‘Testing Program,
would be required to disclose any
studies of test validity, inform

’ students of the meaning of their

test .scores and provide a copy of
the student’s answers and correct
answers to tests upon his request.

“It’s a philosophical question
involved here,” said Barbara
White, Kelley staff aide. “When
you’re in high school or college,
you always get tests back and_can
ask professors questions about
why this or that is wrong.

“With tests like Scholastic
Aptitude Tests, ACT assessments,
Graduate Record Examinations or

' medical and law school admission

tests, you should be able to do the
same thing, to learn from your
mistakes. These tests determine

whether or not you'll have a career
in the field you choose. They’re too
'important to not have the oppor-
tunity to better your knowledge.”
Another Harrisburg education
lobbyist said ETS has made several
phone calls to Democratic caucus
offices to enlist lobbyists and has
presented their negative stance to
members of the education commit-
tee. The “think tank’s” opposition
to the Pennsylvania proposal is-
essentially that which was voiced in
New York, where legislation that is
the model for Pennsylvania’s bill
was loudly opposed but passed and
scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1,
1980, according to published
reports.

“Right now, ETS re-uses 2/3 of
questions on any standardized test.
Ifthe state’s ‘Truth in Testing’ bill
passes, ETS claims it will cost more
to administer the tests since more
research and development will be
necessary to avoid excessive
replication of questions.” Tive

, said, “ETS also calims the validity

of the tests would be undermined
because students will be able to
determine the nature of test
questions and their true under-
standing of subject matter will not
be measured, just an ability to
effectively conjecture what ques-
tions will be.” ‘i
He added that proponents of the
bill claim that disclosure of correct
answers to the tests will force
testing services to provide exams
that are above board——‘tricky
questions will be avoided-through
public scrutiny when testing
organizations are required to
justify how unobvious answers are
derived. ' - 0,
Persons in favor of the legislation
also claim that providing answers
will eliminate discriminatory test-
ing since the equivalent of ‘test
preparationvclasses’ will be avail-
able to all students, regardless of
income. Currently, only middle
class students can afford to prepare
for standardized entrance tests via
special classes that have an

average cost of $300, leaving lower
middle class students—typical1y
those from minority groups-—
nearly unaware of the style of the
tests and of what subjects are likely
to be covered on the exams, Tive
said..

Members of faculty organiza-
tions must quickly resolve their
differences, he continued, if there
is any majority inclination to

support the bill, which is expected .
. to come up for debate on the Senate

floor in February, or March.
New York's case indicates strong
anti-legislation lobbying with ETS

spending substantial sums of 1

money there to hire lobbyists away
from General Motors Corporation.
The ‘Association of American
Medical Colleges has also spent
thousands of dollars in preparing a
lawsuit against the state of.New
York for okaying legislation that
allegedly would infringe copyright
laws —by requiring widespread
publication of protected exam
material.

Lobbyists from Pitt, contacted at
their Oakland offices, said the
university has not taken a stand on
any legislation aimed at standard-
ized tests.

“We’re really uncertain about
whether we will support the bill or
are against it,” said Dennis
McManus of Pitt’s Office of
Governmental Relations about the
Harrisburg version of “Truth in
Testing.” / McManus added that
his office has received no feedback
from Pitt faculty or staff about the
bill.

In Washington, two exam
disclosure bills are in limbo
because sponsors found there was
not enough support .to move the
bills from subcommittee debate to
a vote "of the parent body, the
House Education and Labor Com-
mittee, according to Lou Tronzo,
Pitt’s Washington lobbyist.

“We’ve been w_atching'the
legislation and we’re interested
because of the repercussions. We
are concerned because of ‘the

esting’BiIl$Pill'ks CynicismInFaculiy      

adverse effects, those possibly
being that we would lose a
principal on which to admit
students.

“In my own opinion—and I
stress that—some requirements of
the bill are capricious and
mischievious, and any legislation

 

that is designed for mischief is‘

bad, ’ ’ Tronzo said.

“It’s a matter of ETS correcting
administrative problems that can
be corrected without legislation to
negotiate with the unhappy pub-
lic.” ’

Mondale Adresses PSEA
Praises American Spirit

(Continued from page 1)
Mondale continued that educ-
ation benefits the country’s de-

fense by expanding technological

know-how; culture, by creating
new art forms and “social justice”
by instructing children “that no
one is born to specific status or
class.”

The vice president received

several standing ovations from

PSEA members, particularly when
commenting on educational theory.

“We must have resources and
good teachers and then we-must
leave them alone to do their work.
(We must‘ not) bury teachers in
paperwork and forms. I will say
that the federal state, and local
governments are responsible for

too much paperwork. H We must‘

stop this.

“It isn't up to the federal
government to tell teachers how to
teach. It is up to the government to
give educators the facilities they
need to instruct (and to) leave
educators alone to teach—they
know how to. do it.” ,

Mondale made no direct com-
ment on the upcoming presidential
race, only remarking at one point to
Jacque Angeles, PSEA director
whose bid for re-election was

‘ tested later that afternoon, that “l

think re-election is a good idea.”

The vice-president was also
optimistic about the steel industry,
recently "shocked by.U.S. Steel’s
decision to eliminate 13,000 jobs

The apparent isolation of

S Media According
To Bemsteinl

On the speaking circuit, Carl Bernstein has
capitalized on his fame as half of the Washington
Post’s Watergate reporting duo to establish himself

automatically qualifies Bernstein for this job’ is
questionable, but Bernstein’s analysis of the present
day state of the press is not. Bernstein, no longer
with the Washington Post, indicts the media on three
counts that long have been recognized as failing of

newspaper writers,
television news teams and radio reporters from the
outside world is the most difficult problem for the

that the press is an “arrogant” institution.

Solutions to this problem are not evident quickly
because it is somewhat necessary that the press
operate in isolation.’ If media are to act as a conveyer
of news, the professionals who run.these institutions

According to Bernstein, the resulting public feeling is

must have enough freedom from the vacilliating
public opinion and interloping government officials
to decide what news items are important enough to

be included in the available space in a newspaper or

role in Watergate

by the media.

in the time of a half-hour television show.
This does not mean media can ignore the public,
and some newspapers have tried different means to
be open to public comment and criticism. Hiring an '
ombudsman who receives complaints and comments
from a newspaper’s readers and tries. to resolve any
problems is one such measure. Perhaps the best step
to avoid isolation is an active news staff that is
constantly in touch with the different groups served
Such a staff not only prevents
‘ isolation, but it also ensures that the media always
are aware of possible »news besides the latest city
council proceedings and the new tally of crime
reports from city police.
Shallow coverage of news, which often consists
only of the‘regurgitation- of public statements by
officials, is a second problem for the modern media.

 

media today. With some justification, much of the
public sees newspapers and television to be
' organizations callously pursuing news without any
-concern about the effects of its reporting. A large

tpart of this attitude grows from the closeted’

operations of news organizations, which are open to
little public input ‘besides letters to the editor.

Although both -newspapers and television are guilty
of thispractice, the predominance of this type of
reporting in television is more glaring. Standard
local televisionareports on a governmentcontroversy

' consist of a microphone being shoved in front of the

mayor or governor and the asking of two or three
very simple questions. Such news reporting fails to

give the audience much’ information and allows
officials to evade questions easily. ,

, To avoid this problem, there must be a radical
change in the approach to newsgathering. Instead of
emphasizing spot news like the most recent
pronouncements ‘of the chancellor or the latest
mugging on LibertyvAv,enue, journalists must report
in-depth on trends like the effect of ‘university-
government ties on education or the causes of an
increasing crime rate. These types of stories are the
ones that truly help people become aware of
problems and the shortcomings of government.

Balance between so-called “soft news” and “hard
news?’ in the media is becoming a growing problem
also. With. the growth of gossip magazines like
People and US, and a wave of massive American
apathy, newspaper and other media have.begun to
emphasize superflous stories, like California Gov.
Jerry Brown and singer Linda Ronstadt ﬂying
together to Africa and the newest antics of Billy
Carter, ’ A it

While Bernstein sees the answer to be the emphasis
of hard news about government and politics over
gossipy stories about superstars, thesolution is not
that simple. If newspapers are going to cater to their
audiences, they must recognize that manypeople care
more about some juicy gossip than they do about the
effectiveness of revenue ‘sharing.
journalists must walk a tightrope, giving attention to

In this area

soft news and making sure the important news of ,

government and politics is not ignored. Media can
do this best by being committed to the reporting of
all news and being less concerned about margins of

Writer Protests Group 'Attacl<" On Newspaper Salespeople

This letter is to protest the attack
on Militant salespeople by mem-
bers of the Communist Workers
Party, (formerly Workers View- .
point Organization). This is the
third in a series of attacks by the
CWP on Militant salespeople.

On Wednesday, November 14th
at 7:45 p.m.. I and three other
members of the Socialist Workers
Party were selling the Militant. the

- weekly newspaper of the SWP. in
- the Graduate School of Public
Health prior to the meeting- on Iran
organized by Iranian Student
Association. Palestine Solidarity
Committee. Anti-lmperialist Stu-
dent Union. and Nicaragua Solidar-
ity Committee. While we were
selling. we were approached by a
. ' member of the CWP who had just
* previously been selling their news-
, ' paper in the same building. He
- ‘ initially indicated he was interested
‘ in ,buying a paper from one of our
salespeople but was immediately
joined by two other members of the
CWP who llll‘CalCnln_<__:l_\' told our
stile .person’ that tl_tc_\' weren‘t

the seller. Our salesperson turned
away and continued to sell the
paper_to people who had come to
attend the meeting. The three
_members of the CWP then accosted

" another of \our salespeople. grab-

bed a bundle of newspapers from
his hand and began to tear them
and throw them on the‘ ground.
They again threatened to physically
stop us selling and declared we
were “pimping on their dead
comrades."

This was a reference to the fact
that ‘one of our lead stories was
entitled: “Brutal Klan Murders.
Were_Cops lnvolved?” This story
dealt with the complicity of the
cops in the massaereby the Klan of
five members of the CWP who
were taking part in an anti-racist
demonstration in Greensboro,
North Carolina on Nov. 3. The
issue also contained the text of a
statement released Nov. 6 by

Andrew Pulley. Socialist Workers‘

Party candidate for President of the
United States which reads in part.
"The Noventber 3 assassination of
five anti-Klan demonstrators in
Greensboro. Ntt-.--h Carttlina was .;t

every working person in this
country.

“I urge the labor movement
nationwide. black and other civil
rights organizations, ' women’s
groups—every decent human
being——1o unite to condemn this

massacre. We must stand up and.

call a halt to Ku Klux" Klan and
Nazi violence and demand that the
murderous scum responsible for

this outrage be brought to justice." .

To the attpmpt to prevent us
from selling our paper we told them
that just as we supported their
right to publish and- sell their
newspaper. we expected them to
support our‘ right to do the same.
At this stage. the confrontation was
broken upsby’ Campus Police and
Pittsburgh Police.

We condemn. and we urge all

other individuals and groups who,

support the right to freedom of
expression: to condemn this attack
on our right to exercise that
freedom. A

What pleased coach Tim Grgur-
ich most about his basketball

hustling herd of Bucknell Bisons?

“We won.” I

For a season-opener, it wasn't
outstanding and it wasn't bad. The
Panthers’ 83-65 win over Bucknell
was a public display of experimen-
tation: "frequent substitutions,
diversity in offenses and for the

. players, chance to face a team that

wasn't wearing blue or white Pitt
practice jerseys.
And for the 2508 fans at Fitz-

- gerald Field House, it Was 8 C0ﬂt€St

Ellis won by hitting on nine of 15
ﬁeld goal attempts and seven of

_ eight free throws for 25 points. The

Bisons’ 6-3 Lesslie, dunking and
driving as if he were four inches

“You use a double formationto
make them spread out their
defense,” Sherrill explained after
the eame. “And vou do it if you
have a player like Randy McMillan.
At times they gave us problems,
but Danny handled them very
well. Danny ‘did’ an excellent
job. I don’t think the weather or
the wind was a factor at all.”

Not all of Pitt’s heroes were on
the offense, though. The Panther
defensive line handled the Lions up
front, limiting them to 142 yards
rushing (65 on a touchdown run by
Matt Suhey), and 11 first downs.

“For now,’ said Grgurich, “we
just have to go out there with out
guards and have them hold people
off until we can get Eddie and our
bigger guys healthy and back into
the game.” ‘

Although Clancy and 6-9 fresh-
man Paul Brozovich were effective
against Bucknell, both are not 100
percent healthy and no where else
but in the rebounding statistics was
this evident. Clancy in good health
is generally good for at least a

but one. ,

to the inside, and contained the

“There were a couple of plays
out there today by Hugh Green that
no one else in the country could
have made,” said Jackie Sherrill.
Besides the long run by Suhey,
Penn State’s other score came on a.
95-yard kickoff return by freshman
running back Curt Warner, Penn
State’s most dangerous runner.

Q)‘

The long drought is over. The Panther victory
over Penn State Saturday ended a 24-year dry spell
for Pitt at Beaver Stadium. The last Panther win in
the'Lion’s den came in 1955 by a 20-0 margin.

Another streak was ended Saturday. Not since the
1977 Gator Bowl victory over Clemson has Pitt been
able to claim victory on a natural surface. — The
Panthers previously had five consecutive losses on a
grass field. i _

A thirdimportant streak also came to a screeching

ryhalt on Saturday. Jackie Sherrill gained his first
victory (as a head coach) over the Nittany Lions and 7

Joe Paterno. -

But, to this writer, a most important streak came
tumbling down. I saw the Panthers down. the Lions
for the first time while a student at Pitt.

While the media and fansiacross the country (this
writer included) were predicting a low-scoring
defensive battle, everyone (this writer included) was
surprised by the great offensive show put on by the

~

Panthers, and in particular, Randy McMillan and-

Dan Marino.

Marino’s talents won’t be questioned again, if in

.. fact they everwere. No one should ever again say
i anything about his freshmanitis or whatever it would

be called. He just doesn’t make the mistakes
expected of a freshman quarterback (barring one
early interception) playing an arch-rival on national

television.

As for Randy McMillan, there is"not much more to‘\
say that hasn’t already been said. He gained over 200

yards in total offense, was named one of ABC’s
players of the game and appeared onthe front sports
page of the New York Times along with Ralph Still,

celebrating the victory. With that photo, the Pitt-I

Penn State game upstaged even the classic battle
between Army and Navy.

- The word arch-rival is a bit of an understatement;
in the case of Pitt-Penn State. The Panthers and

Lions are rivals in every senseof the word...and then
some. _ 
Not only are the football teams great rivals, but
every student and alumnus of each school is a
bonafide hater of the other.‘ Families have broken up

Panthers End Long Drought With Very Happy Valley Victory
over the rivalry. In »fact, mine almost did. Many  
- friendships have evaporated during college years.

‘more than the footballteam would be knocking

Old-timers still have their fights and a ‘standing bet"
on each year’s game. The rivalry, which began with
the football team, has carried over into every sport
from frisbee ‘to volleyball to basketball. Basically,
the two schools hate each other. "' - 9
Examples of this hatred were.rampant Saturday
throughout Beaver Stadium. The Penn State fans
hung signs with every slogan imaginable, including
“Nuke the Ayatollah and Pitt.” Fans of both teams
wore buttons with every obscene derivative of the
others’ name written on them. '

At several points in the game, it looked as though

heads.‘ At halftime, the Penn State majorettes were
provoking the Pitt Golden Girls with taunts and
gestures while the Pitt squad was performing.

Now, that’s a rivalry. When the majorettes start
mixing it up, there is no doubt that the schools don’t
exactly practice brotherly love towards one another.

The Pitt Panther and the Nittany Lion were
tussling (all in fun, of course) directly in front of the
Penn State student section. After a brief "wrestling
match in which the Lion was triumphant, the State
fans went wild. I thought someone scored a
touchdown and I had missed it. The two mascots
then began talking and ‘put their arms around each
other. At this point, the fans went into a chorus of
boos that could have waken the dead. They "were
out for blood and wanted no parts -of any kind 0
friendship. . . —

There is nothing that will make this intense rivalry
any less fervent. The Panthers and the Lions will
always be tough competitors and this kind of
competition is what college football is all about. It
is a healthy aspect of the_ game and differentiates it,‘
from the pro game. When Pitt and Penn State no
longer dislike one another, I, for one, will resort to

isome_'other.pastime besides college football.

By the way, when did Penn State ever win ,a
national championship? I just had «to get in one last
dig. ‘

“At first, it was a blow to the
term." said Sanft. “But. the team
rallied around that point. ' Some of
the people who normally wouldn’t
do/as well as they did performed
well.”

According to Sanft, 50 percent of
the gymnastscompeting in each
event were freshmen, and there
was only one junior on the floor".

“At this time, the team is
stronger than last year at this
time,” the coach said. “Barring
any more injuries, we should get
better.” '

According to Sanft. the eighth-
ranked Pantherettes should im-
prove on last year’s third place
finish at regionals because of a
strange situation at Clarion. The
Clarion coach left to go to the
University of Florida and took most
of her team with her.

“Clarion is pretty much out of

the picture this year,” she said.
“Penn State, Massachusetts and
New Hampshire glong with us,
should be the top four this season.
Our goal is second place.”
However, Sanft said that the
Pantherettes are not barring the
possibility of defeating Penn State.

“We can give them a good run '

1-1

Before Over 76,000 unbelieving Penn State fans,

0 the Pitt Panthersput it all together and humiliated

the Nittany Lions 29-14. The game was marked by
the long awaited rebirth of the running game.

Unlike previous Pitt—-Penn State game which had
a habit of being titanic defensive struggles, this year’s
' affair was high scoring marked by long runs.

The Panther defense did their job and held the
Nittany Lions to just one touchdown—the other
coming on kickoff return by Warner. The key of the
game, however, was the outstanding play of the
offensive line which dismantled the Penn-State
defense.

Having been criticized for not being able to run the
ball, the Panthers were determined coming into the
game to shove the pigskin down the opposition’s
throat. Bob Gruber, starting left tackle explained
this. “We made up our minds to run inside and we
practiced that all week.” Gruber played a superb
game as .he repeatedly stopped PSU’s Larry Kubin
and helped pave the way for those long dashes by the
Big Mac, Pitt’s Randy MacMillan.

It was a most satisfying win for Gruber. “We
finally put it all together and virtually made no
errors. I think we’re better than our ranking indi-
cates but who can you push out of there?” «

As so often happens in key games, a “different
‘look” surprised the opposition. Gruber explained

the tactic that helped to shape the Pitt win: “They
thought .we were‘ mainly a passing team, but we
decided to use__two tight ends and utilize Mac inside.

By AMIN GHOSSE/N

 

The philosophy behind this is mostly to spread out
their defensive line and make it easier torun.”
Having not played well in recent weeks and
criticized for poor running, this was a special game
for MacMillan. In front of a national television
audience, Big Mac snapped out of his slump and
rumbled through the Nittany Lion defense for 115
yards. ‘
It was a happy day for the Big Mac. “I think 1
proved myself as a major college back. I felt well,
nothing hurt and I was really pumped up.”
McMillan’s performance was a blessing to the
beleaguered Pitt running game, which in past weeks-
has been virtually non-existent. The sudden
resurgence of the ground attack took a huge load off
the talented arm of quarterback Dan Marino.
McMillan was quick to point out however that the
key was the offensive line. “They were just super.
They proved that we can run the ball. When asked
about the two tight end offenses McMillan
responded, “It confused them, but we just beat them
off the ball.”
Pitt fans can finally cheer as their team white-.
washed an undermanned and outclassed Penn State

squad. Ahead is a Fiesta Bowl against Arizona
which really should not be a contest. Although a
bowl game is important,-the anticipation for Pitt fans
should be for next season when the Panthers will be a
definite threat to win the national champions-hip.
‘Hang on fans, there’s plenty of good football ahead.

This weekend marked the
beginning of what promises to be a
rewarding season for both Pitt’s
swimming and diving teams. Pitt’s
men defeated North Carolina
Thursday by a 71-42 score.

“We’re very happy with our
showing,” said coach Fred Lewis.
“Our goal was to qualify for
NCAA’s.

“The psych of the men along.
with their adrealine ﬂowing rapidly
gegought good times from many of
our swimmers.” .

On Saturday, Pitt’s men traveled

  -   Swimmers0penSeasonWith

to Penn State for the 11th annual
Swimming and Diving Relays. Pitt
placed fourth in a ﬁeld of 11 teams.

North Carolina State was first,
North Carolinaisecond and West
Virginia third. "

It seemed a concensus of the
team that they lost not because
they weren't better than the other
teams, but because Pitt only had 14
swimmers when 18 was the limit.
They said they felt the team lacks
the necessary depth to be
competitive in major invitationals.
This year, the athletic department
cut their budget, so that scholar-
ships were dropped which limits

the potential of the team. ‘

“We feel we could have beaten
any of the teams in a dual meet but
each of us had to swim six times,”
said Stu Swanson. “An example of
our ability was how we clobbered
UNC. If we had a few more
swimmers, we could have been
much stronger.”

_ Pitt garnered top honors in two
events. Pat Greenwell and Scott
Winkler won the one-meter diving
and the team of Jerry Zeleski, Rick
Carter, Tom McGinley and Scott
Shearer combined to take first in
the 500-meter crescendo relay.

Pitt has been a winner in the
meet for the past three years, so
the team was very disappointed
with this year's ﬁnish;

Pitt’s women lost to North
Carolina 72-59, but beat Eastern
Michigan 110-21.

Amy Jackson had two strong
swims, winning both of her events.
She won the 200-meter freestyle
with a time of 1:52.1 and the
100-meter free in 52.4.

“The team gave a 110 percent
effort,” said Jackson. “We swam
better this ‘year than we- did last
year against UNC. We’ll be ready
to do some national qualifying:
times now.”

Nancy Henry won the 200-meter

the 100-meter fly in 59.0.

“My attitude has changed this
year,” Henry said. “I feel that
we’ll be stronger as a team if we
all swim for each other instead of
for individual times. I am psyched
for a rewarding season.”

Cindy Ferraro won the one-meter
diving with a score of 221.7. Cindy

-said she felt good, but is looking

forward to the rest of the season.

Julie DeHaven won the three-
meter diving and qualiﬁed for
AIAW’s. '

Other strong performances came
from Jackson who placed second in
the 200-meter ﬂy. Freshmen Kay
Mayden and Bonnie Durdy placed
second in one-meter diving and the
400-meter individual medley, res-
pectively. Suzanne Pulley was
second in the SO-meter, freestyle
and Tracy Terrele was second in
three-meter diving.

- “I’m very pleased with the
results,” said coach Dick Brad-
shaw. “Each year, we swim UNC,
we get closer to beating them.
Everyone is swimming well for the
beginning of the season. I look for
their times to be improved
quickly.”
