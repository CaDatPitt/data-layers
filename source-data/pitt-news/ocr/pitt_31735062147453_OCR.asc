Bingham Predicts
National Pl e n ty
Under New Order

Editor Of “Common Sense” Cites
Recent Production Surveys,
Urges New Third Party

 

By James Donoghue

In terms of cold logic, yet backed
by a sympathetic understanding that
amounted almost to eloquence, Alfred
Bingham, editor of “Common Sense,”
stated at Inquiry Forum that there is
an imperative need for a revision of
our national order.

“The most obvious fact today,” said
Mr. Bingham, after a few words‘ of
introduction, “is that there are mil-
lions hungry, millions idle, and much
widespread unrest;
plenty ' potentially
one.”

Citing facts compiled recently by
the National Survey of Potential Pro-
ductive Capacity, "a project carried
on by unemployment relief funds, Mr.
Bingham
there is no doubt that society could
produce far more than enough to go
around if it only chose to do so. For
instance, it was estimated that in
1929, 90 billion dollars worth of food
services and the like were produced.
However, if the productive facilities
in operation at that time were utiliz-
ed to their fullest extent, it was esti-
mated that 135 billion dollars worth
of goods could have been produced.
Further, if all technological improve-
ments in industry were applied today
and our present methods made more
efficient, the statisticians computed
that the amount of goods that could
be produced, in the United States
would be unlimited.

20-Hour Week Possible

ready for

“The survey,” continued Mr. Bing—_

ham, “bore out prophecies to the ef-
fect that we could ﬁood the country
with goods, could bury ourselves be-
neath a pile of food, luxuries, necessi-
ties a.nd every other thing. It is in-
disputable that we have the means of
satisfying all our necessities and com-
forts.”

The possibility of shorter working
hours . was discussed. If such a
scheme of production were put into
effect, an average of 20 Working hours
a week would not be in the least im-
possible.

The problem of adequate housing.
Mr. Bingham conceded, would take
considerably more time for a proper
solution than industrial production.
“Three fourths of the people today
live in slums,”, the speaker maintain-
ed, “and it would take 15 years to
house them adequately. And when
that is done we would have to start
cleaning our backyard.

“Coming into Pittsburgh during the
last hour,” he went on_ “it seemed as
though it was all back yard. There
are many things to be done to make
Pittsburgh—with its green hills and
pleasant valley—the beautiful city
that it ought to be.- Perhaps I am
stepping on some toes in saying this,"
he remarked.

Three or four scattered laughs
answered him from the audience.

“During the depression at least 300
billion dollars have been wasted by
reason of idle factories, idle labor, re-
duced farm acreage, and the like. We
might just as well have piled those
300 billion dollars in a big heap and
burned them. Besides that sum, the
war was insigniﬁcant,” the speaker
Said.

‘With the inauguration of Franklin
Roosevelt in 1933 there was a promise
of “a more abundant life.”

“Capitalism,” said Mr. Bingham in
commenting on this, “will not provide
a more abundant life. Capitalism re-

Students Injured
In Autoﬂiccident
After Irish Game

Eugene Grennan, E36, and Vvilson
A. Griffiths, C37, both members of Phi

Inquiry Presents

Candidate Coyne
.At Forum Today

At 12:30 o’clock today, in Room
107, Alumni Hall, Inquiry Forum will
present State Senator James J. Coyne,
present Republican candidate for
County Commissioner, as its featured
speaker. --

Senator Coyne will give the ﬁrst
in a series of‘ three purely political
speeches to be presented by Inquiry
Forum. The second speaker will be
State Senator George Rankin, pres-
ent candidate for County Commission-
er on the Democratic ticket, who will
speak on Monday, at a special meet-
ing; and Charles C. McGovern, candi-
date on the Square Deal ticket for re-
election as County Commissioner will
‘be the principal speaker, next Wed-
nesday. ‘ _,

Katherine Monori, C36, co-chairman
of Inquiry Forum, issued the follow-
ing statement: “In consideration of
the fact that the meetings of the

Forum for this week and next week
are of a political (campaign) nature,
and therefore highly sensitive to the
political beliefs of the speakers and
the audience, I would ask students
attending the next three meetings to
be especially careful in their ques-
tioning. To preserve the “Forum”
spirit, ask questions for information
only, not to embarrass or heckle
tliefse guests of the University.”

Education Subjectsi Range
Widely At Convention Here

 

By Sydney Horovitz ’

At the joint meeting of the Penn-
sylvania State Education Association
and the Western Pennsylvania Educa-
tion Conference, attended here Thurs-
day, Friday and Saturday by between
8.000 and 10,000 teachers, discussion
ranged through such subjects as pro-
gressive education, development of
character in youth.’ standardized
tests, police ‘administration, and
whether educators should discuss
controversial social problems in the
classroom.

Members of the University faculty

, played a large part in the proceedings
‘ by supervising sessions and deliver-

ing addresses. . ‘
Administration

A School Forum
led by Dr. Charles E. Prall, dean -of
the School of Education, Thurs-

day, was unable -to agree on any def-
inition of progressive education, but
seemed in general accord that the
school program must change and pro-
gress as new demands are made on it.

The discussion panel, when asked
for a vote, disagreed as to whether
the activity program and the con-
struction project methods were es-
sential features of progressive educa-
tion.

Dr. Pickens E. Harris, associate
professor of philosophy and educa-
tion, pointed out that progressives did
not wish to do away with subject
matter, but rather to approach it with
a new and different integration,
which will make it cl Nser and more
meaningful to the life of the student.

In reply to the contention brought
before the group that the pupil can
approach truth and freedom only
through a supervisory discipline.
Dean .Prall stated that the belief in
strength of character developed by
discipline" is nolonger held in wide
repute. ‘ ' -

Dean Prall warned that we must
not be too zealous in “loading up pu-
pils with all ‘the problenis society has
ﬂunked. They merit a more "-optimi-s-,
tic diet.” '
' Dr.” Harris pointed" out the two‘ op-

posing stresses laid on the child as a
creature who thinks, and a creature
who experiences. He asked, “Does a
child learn ﬁrst and then act, or does
he act ﬁrst a.nd then learn?” He then
proceeded to describe the child as -a.
living, moving animal, full of wiggles
and movement and reaction, who ﬁrst
experiences the world and then learns
aboutit, who'is ﬁrst active and then
passively mental. _ -  . ,

The heroe_s,o_f, history have more in-
ﬂuencne o‘n"'st'uden'ts than‘ any formal
course- of character building, '-Dr. S.
P. .Franklin,_ professor of.-education.
told ,a_. _Secondary. Education confer-
ence in Carnegie Music Hall Friday.

“It is easier to teach character
through’ the inﬂuence of lives than in
'the classroom,” Dr. Franklin‘ explain-
ed, declaring that the characters of
George Washington. ‘Abraham Lin-
coln, and other great men should be
emphasized] while history is being
taught. " A

The desires of people ' must be
changed gradually through education,
the speaker affirmed, although reform
movements such as the present ef-
forts to clean up the movies and to in-
stitute better radio programs, are ex-
tremely valuable.

Dr. James S. Taylor, professor of
mathematics, addressed the group on
“Standardized Tests and Normal Dis-
tributioir Laws.” He declared that
some su-bstitute should be found for
the individual opinion of teachers in
the grading of papers.

Dr.’ Elmer D. Graper, head of the
department of political science and
chairma.u of the newly-orga.nized Po-
lice Research Commission, spoke on
“Modern Problems in Police Adminis-
tration” ‘Saturday morning. -

DI‘. Graper told the Social Studies
section that local control of police “is
becoming less important every year.”
He f.av,o,rs _sta.t_e _cont_rol,or at least

McKay Returns
From Convention

 

Believes Association’s Discussions?

Will Inﬂuence Tax Programs

The annual National Tax Associa-
tion meeting, held last week in Okla-
homa City, included among its.600
delegates representatives from .40
states, Canada, Mexico, and HawaEi,
according to Dr. Marion K. McKay,
instructor in economics in-the School
of Business Administration, a.nd_Penn-
sylvania representative at the con-
vention. _,

Delegates represented large groups

of ta.x payers, taxing ofﬁcials, "and
teachers and scholars of public
ﬁnance throughout the land; The

purpose of the. convention was, to re-
view the more important tax problems
of the day through a non-par_tisan', in-
formal discussion. Important prob"-
lems that received,_the attentiQn__.of
the convention were: “The exte“i1t.1:o
which the federal government is.I_nalr-
ing use of tax money which formerly,
for the most part, has been ‘reserved
for state expenditure”_; “Place of" the
income tax in the state rever_me sys-
tems”; “Movement for .exe_mptio_n'}nf
homesteads from taxation”;' and the
“Place that the general property 
will occupy in the tax programs of the
future.” _ , 
Referring to the importance of _1bc
meeting. Dr.’ McKay stated that,
“Some of the discussion reflected the
economic feeling of the country,’_’ and
that. “the deliberations of the con-
vention have a great deal of inﬂuence
in the tax programs of every pro-
gressive state in the country.” Dr.
McKay went on to explain that the
convention never went on record as
recommending any particular program
because of the danger of creating in-'
ternal dissention within the a.<;sc>c‘i;i,-
l‘.iOl'l, and "once more empha.sized‘1.bat
it was purely a discussion group. -p
The 600 delegates were aclrlre.=i.=<ml
by several well-known stndentson the
subject of taxation. including Gov-
ernor Marland of Oklahoma,-a.nd"Scn--
ator Gore, also of Oklahoma. _

Editorial Briefs

Wliile the Monday morning quarterbacks and
the usual second guessers who never miss a tackle
or fumble a punt—are busy explaining what was
wrong with the Panthers against Notre Dame, it ’s
unlikely that any of the coaching staff are losing
sleep.

Those who attribute part of the responsibility
for the defeat to the presence of six sophomores
in the starting lineup may pause to reﬂect how
valuable those boys will be during the next two
years. Few people will balk at trading one for
two.

Those in charge of Inquiry Forum this year cer-
tainly deserve credit for the consistency with
which they are presenting interesting speakers to
University students. They have taken to holding
meetings on Monday to take care of all their at-
tractions. If this keeps up, there will have to be
more days in the week.

‘When better football action pictures are made,
we’re going to compare them with Luke Swank’s
ﬁne photograph appearing in connection with
“Jock” Sutherland ’s football article in “The Sat-
urday Evening Post.”

There appears to be no end to the ingenuity of
the women in concocting ceremonies for the fresh-
man girls. The Hearth Ceremony tonight is re-
ported to be one of the best.

If all the newspaper men who have applied for

press seats for the Army game were laid en.d to
end Frank Carver might get a little sleep.

Bingham Predicts
National Plenty

(Continued From Page One)
quires scarcity. lt demands new
frontiers, both geographical and in-
dustrial, and frontiers today exist
only in the imagination. Installment
selling and practically unlimited
credit before 1929 did provide tem-
porary new frontiers for a time, but
there are no new frontiers today. And
as to war providing a new frontier

that would be a very poor makeshift.”

In an eﬁort to make the present
system function better there have
been attempts to create a scarcity.
The future of such plans, Mr. Bing-
ham believes, would be but “a tem-
porary stabilization at a very low
standard of living.”

“Capitalism can only be kept alive
by feeding it from ﬁve to eight billion
dollars a year. It is interesting to
ponder how the Republicans, if they
get into office, will rationalize about
such spending.

ﬁce,” he resumed, “unless it is as
lavish with money as the business
men won’t be. It will take only half-
a-dozen such years of spending before

the whole preposterous house of
cards will collapse."
And following that: “. there

will possibly be a chaotic, violent
revolution without leadership for no
party today can supply such leader-
ship.”

Mr. Bingham termed a Socialist or
Communist rise to power as “a for-
lorn hope."

“Only three per cent of the votes
cast in the presidential election were
for these parties, regardless of what
Mr. Hearst says."

S-ees Brighter Side

But the national picture is not with-
out a brighter side. According to the
speaker there are three sources of a
sound radical movement. First of
all there is the old Populist tradition,
which has its roots in Jeffersonian
revolt against Hamilton and the
money men and continued down
through Jackson and the Greenback
movement to the Populist movement
proper. That the Populists followed
many “false gods” Mr. Bingham does
not deny, but in the main he believes
that they contributed something vital
to American. life. “Revolutions grow,”
he said. “They are not created out
of the brain. We are in the midst of
revolution now and revolution itself
implies profound change.”

The second cource is the so-called
“technocratic" movement. It em-
bodies the engineering approach to
the problems of society and it had
Thorstein Veblen for its father. Thus
far it has commanded more attention
in the Vifest under Upton Sinclair’s
epic banner, than it has in the East,
despite the Technocracy flurry in
New York several years ago. The
central idea is production for use.

The third source is organized labor.
The heated debate at the recent
American Federation of Labor con-
vention in Atlantic City arose out of
the demand that labor participate di-

the fence and hoping that the victor
in return for support would pass
needful legislation.

Panthers Forget N otre Dame,
Concentrate On State Game

N ittany Lions Will Seek Fo

urth Straight Win Saturday‘

In Renewal Of Football Series With Pitt Team

\Vhile most pigskinadherents were still recovering from the

Ieﬁects of the Pitt-Notre Dame classic last Saturday, Coach Jock

Sutherland’s Panther team went back to work at the practice ﬁeld
to get ready for the next tartar on the schedule, a clash with Penn
State at the Stadium next Saturday afternoon.

The Nittany Lions, missing from theé

Pitt football schedule for the last three
seasons, will bring to Pittsburgh a vet-
eran combination, victorious in the
three games played this fall. Coach
Bob Higgin’s forces opened their sea-
son with a, 14-7 victory over Lebanon
Valley and followed this initial suc-
cess with a 2-0 win over the strong
Western Maryland eleven.

Last Saturday the Lions displayed
their best form of the season by down-
ing Lehigh, 26-0. In this contest
Coach «Higgins uncovered a real scor-
ing threat in Fritz Andrews, a reserve
halfback who has warmed the bench
for the lastvcouple of seasons. An-
drews broke loose for an 80-yard jaunt

in the third quarter for the ﬁnal Lion‘

score.

Fourteen lettermen returned to the
Blue and VVhite squad this year for
gridiron service, and the large number
of promising candidates from last sea-
son's crack freshman team has given
Higgins the best material that he has
had in recent years down at the Center
county school.

State will present- a veteran, heavy
line against the Panthers on Saturday,
with six j experienced men holding
down varsity berths in the forward‘
wall. Bill Miller, a junior, is the only
newcomer to the line this season, and
he has a year’s experience behind him.

Miller and Frank Smith will proba-
bly start at the end posts. Smith, out
with an injury last week, will be in
shape to play against Sutherland’s
team. Smith weighs around the 175-
pound mark while his teammate at
the other terminal position hits the
scales at 195-pounds.

The rest of the State forward wall is
made up of plenty of “beef-trusters.”
A pair of 200-pounders ﬁll the tackle
positions, those being Captain Bob
Weber and Roy Schuyler. At guards,
Higgins has Luther Barth, a 200-pound-
er, and either Johnny Economis, _a
Schenley High product, or IFranc1s
Wismer, another 200-pounder. Chuck
Cherundola handles the center duties,
and he misses the 200 mark by only
ﬁve pounds.

Behind this formidable breastwork,
Higgins uses a quartet of fast, fairly
light backs. In the last game, the
Blue and ‘White eleven started practic-
ally a sophomore foursome, Frank
O’Hara at quarter being the only let-
terman. Sam Donato and Fritz Owens,
a pair of ﬂashy ﬁrst-year speedsters,
shared the halfback posts, and Walt
Kominic, New Castle boy, ﬁlled the
fullback’s shoes. _

Bill Cooper, Mike Kornick, Perry
High School ﬁash,VVendell Wear,;Ron-
nie Knapp, Tom Silvano, Fritz An-
drews, and Bill Rhoda are some of the
other backs who will see plenty of
service next Saturday. VVear, a 142-

“California Here I Come”
Sings Bill Blair Who Will
Go To Coast With Pitt

   

If any of you are selling chances
on a raffle or having a drawing for
a ﬁve-pound box of candy, just drop
around to Bill Blair, he’ll be a sucker
for anything -like that now.

Bill is one of three junior managers
of the varsity football team. Last
week Jimmy Hagan, popular graduate
manager of athletics, confessed to the
three boys that only one of them
could be carried along with the team
on its December trip to California for
the game with USC.

Jimmy decided to put three num-
bers in a hat and have the boys draw
for the right to make the trip. Just

“Jock” Sutherland.
lucky today, Dr. Sutherland?” Bill
asked. Dr. Sutherland did; he
reached in and pulled out slip No. 1,
which carried with it the fragrance
of roses and the vision of movie
queens.

Bill Housel and Jack Bailey, the
other junior managers, prevailed upon
Bill Kern, assistant football coach,
and Frank Carver, director of ath-
letic publicity, to do the drawing for
them. Bailey then got the No. 2 slip
and chose the trip to New York for
the Fordham game. Housel was left
with No. 3, which was worth nothing
more than a free trip to South Bend
the past week-end.

As a result, Blair is acquiring a
taste for orange juice and Dr. Suth-
erland can hold his own with any
magicians who pull rabbits out of
hats by recalling the time when he
pulled a trip to California out of a
felt chapeau.

Panther Harriers
Meet Penn State

Notre Dame Gets Revenge Victory
As Pitt Runners Lose, 25-30

Nicked by the Irish, 25-30, at South
Bend last week, Coach Olson’s har-
riers expect nothing but double trou-

pounder, has averaged approximately
eight yards every time he carried the '
ball thus far this season.

Last season, although losing to both
Syracuse and Penn, the State team
gained more ground in those two
clashes than the victors did. Harvey
‘Harman, Penn coach, is reported to
have said that the Penn State team
showed the best offense of any team
that Penn played last year.

Pitt came out of the Notre Dame
struggles with the usual amount of
bumps and bruises. Hub Randour,
who played exceptionally well, re-‘
ceived more than his share of them.
but he will probably be in there again
next Saturday.

‘When Do We Meet?’
Ask Pitt, Kiski Teams

“When are we going to play?’’ That
is the question being asked by the
freshman gridders in reference to the
Kiski game, The game was originally
scheduled for Friday and later the
date for the contest was shifted to
Saturday. Now the officials are dis-
satisﬁed again and want the game
moved back to Friday.

«Barring injuries, Coach Mike Milli-
gan will probably use the same start-
ing lineup against Kiski, as he did
against the Tech plebes two weeks
ago. Eager to avenge last year’s
surprise setback, the Little Panthers
are working hard in their daily drills
on the practice ﬁeld.

The boys from Saltsburg traveled
to Annapolis last week and were
trounced 27-0 at the hands of the
Navy plebes, while the Little Pan-
thers took things easy. A‘-.. »

‘ole from the Nittany Lions here Sat-
urday.

Last year, Penn State hung up an
undefeated record for the season. Pitt
fell early in November before George
Harvey and his mates over the Saucon
Valley Club course at State. The
ﬁnal score read 24-31.

Harvey is lost to this year’s team,
along with Joe Alexander. But two
other boys, Downey and Book, return
to threaten the Panthers with another
whipping. Coach Olson was not
pleased with the outcome at Notre
Dame, but stated optimistically “VVe’l]
get ’em next year.” Time-trials this
week will show him just where his
men stand in preparation for the sec-
ond dual encounter of the year.

In their first start of the season last
Saturday, the Panthers lost out to
Notre Dame.

Francis. Nicholson's sophomore
star, led the ﬁeld to the tape, negoti-
ating the short course in the fair time
of 18 minutes. 21 seconds. Harold
Tost, veteran Panther, pushed the
leader throughout the race, only to be
nosed out in the ﬁnal stretch.

Another South Bender, McFarland,
followed Tost over the ﬁnish line in
third place with Bud Groat, Pitt, a
few yards behind him in fourth posi-
tion.

Others to ﬁnish in the “money"
were: McKenna, Notre Dame, ﬁfth;
Gormley, Notre Dame, sixth; Leggin,
Pitt, seventh; Cook, Pitt, " eighth;
‘Theriault, Pitt, ninth; -and -Hennesay’,
Notre Dame, tenth.

The Irish, by virtue of the close tri-
umph, gained revenge for a shutout
defeat handed them here by the O1-
sonmen last fall. A crowd of 1,000
‘watched the race.

 Watching

Pitt Foes 

 

Pitt’s future opponents didn’t fare
so badly as a group last Saturday as
they did two Saturdays ago. The
next three foes on the Panther card
all scored victories, the next oppon-
ent tied, and the last two met with
reverses.

The Penn State Lion got up on its
hind legs to show off before a Home-
coming crowd of 10,000 and roared
out with a 26-0 victory over Lehigh.
The Lion attack ﬁnally began to click
and Fritz Andrews, a sub halfback,
raced 80 yards for a score to make
it a great day all around.

Fordham took over the Vanderbilts
and a tackle named Ronnie Throg-
morton by a 13-7 score. The Rams
throttled the Vandy vaunted air at-
tack and pulled a few surprises of
their own to repulse the southern in-
vaders.

Army, led by a little halfback, Monk
Meyer, tur-ned the tide on fair Harvard
by ' scoring a’ 13-0 ‘victory,,'the .fir.st.. the.
Pointers have ever achieved against

Harvard at the West Point ﬁeld.

Nebraska’s Cornhuskers evidently
hadn’t quite recovered from the lick-
ing handed them by Minnesota when
they took on Kansas State Saturday.
Maybe, again, it was the cheers of the
State Homecoming congregation
which helped the Kansas boys to hold
the Nebraska boys to a scoreless tie.
Whatever it was, Lloyd Cardwell,
Jerry Lanoue, and all the other
Huskers didn't do much harvesting.

Carnegie Tech couldn’t do much,
the way these Temple Owls were
screeching at the Stadium, and lost
out to Pop Warner's outﬁt, 13-0.

The Trojan war horse got another
saddle burn when Oregon State
slipped over two touchdowns in the
ﬁrst half and held off USC in the sec-
ond half to net a 13-7 victory. A back
named Bob Mountain, whom Califor-
nians swear must be related to the
Rocky Mountains. rocked the famed
steed with as brilliant a performance
ras they have seen out there on the
coast. '

Patrick Keeps Eastern Scoring Lead
By Making Six-Pointer Against Irish

Fullback Scores 47 Points;
Counts Six Touchdowns,

Two Field Goals

Frank Patrick, Panther fullback who
chalked up the lone touchdown scored
against the Irish, continues to hold
ﬁrst place in the race for individual
scoring honors in the East. _

By the six-pointer last Saturday,
Patrick boosted his total to 47 points
for the season. This would give him
an average of approximately 12 points
per game. Frank has scored six
touchdowns, kicked ﬁve extra points
from placement, and booted two ﬁeld
goals.

Eddie Stanley, of Williams, holds
second place by virtue of seven touch-
downs to his credit while J-aeger, Col-
gate star, with six touchdowns is in
third place. McBurney and Etzwiler,
a couple of W. & J. backs, are the
only other district players among the
ﬁrst 15 scorers, the former tied for
sixth place and the latter deadlocked
for eighth position.

Thehusky Blue and Gold line plung-
er has crossed the goal line at least
one time in each of the four games
that the Panthers have played. In
the Waynesburg contest he tallied
eight markers; against Washington
and Jefferson he contributed 22 points
to the -Panther’s 35; in the Mountain-
eer encounter he added 11 tallies; and
then last Saturday he reached the 47
mark with his line plunge for a touch-
down in the second quarter.

His two ﬁeld goals also makes him
high man in this department.

Dr. Carlson Lets Down Bars,
Invites Upperclass Novices

Any Undergraduate May Enter Basketball Tournament;
Applicants To Indicate Time They Can Play

Entries are already pouring in upon
Dr. H. Clifford Carlson, head basket-
ball coach, for his annual Freshman
Basketball Week tournament, due to

begin Monday.

Along with the ﬂood of entries
came a chorus of cries from upper-
classmen, each of them demanding to
know why this party was strictly a
ﬁrst-year affair. After soothing sev-
eral anxious upperclass novices with
pieces of black and red candy, the
good Doctor ﬁnally decided to let
down the bars and admit all under-
graduates to the fun. All entrants
will be novices, of course.

Dr. Carlson plans to run his tourna-
ment next Monday, Tuesday, Thurs-
day, and Friday. When ﬁlling out the
application blank appearing below, it
is important that each entrant signify
what time is most suitable for him to
play. The ﬁrst games of each day
will begin at 2 o'clock and other
teams will meet at intervals of one
hour.

According to present arrangements,
the various teams will be named after
deans and prominent officials of the
University. Prizes will be awarded
also for the best-dressed and the most
sloppily-dressed basketeer.

A host of other prizes are to be
awarded for anything from the oddest
uniform and socks to the biggest feet

and the most hairy. legs. Thenature

Freshman Basketball Week
Check time best suited for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday

of the prizes is still up Dr. Carlson's
sleeve, along with a few ideas of ﬁnd-
ing some real basketball material
among the novices.

Differing from previous tourna-
ments, Dr. Carlson stresses the point
that this tournament will not accept
any team entries. Individual applica-
tions must be made. "Not only can
we keep the teams fairly evenly
matched in that manner,” pointed out
the doctor, “but also we do our bit in
helping freshmen to become better
acquainted, which is the main idea of
the thing anyhow.”

The Panther coach also stresses the
fact that there is no fee connected
with the tournament. All the equip-
ment that is necessary is a suit, a
pair of shoes, a pair of socks, and a
towel.

One of the entry blanks appearing '

below, when properly ﬁlled out, is the
sole ticket of admission. Dr. Carlson
urges that each contestantremember
to check the time most convenient for
him to play.

All games are to be played upon the
Stadium ﬂoor. Referees will be
chosen from the students of the class
in officiating being given now at the
University.

“C’mon up to the Stadium” is the
Carlson cry, replacing for the nonce
that famed “Win-em-All” -slogan of
basketball seasons. .7

Architect Advises
Polish Committee

Ceiling Plans Deemed Impractical
For Nationality Room Design

 

 

Besides the Bal Tabarin that is be-
ing arranged for the beneﬁt of the
French Nationality Room, plans for
the other ‘nationality rooms -of the
Cathedral are getting on apace, what
with the Polish Room Committee im-
porting an advisory architect and the
Scottish Room committee .I‘€.C11DeTi1t-
ing from a “feast of the" month” held
here last week. '

The “crystal ceiling” that had been
proposed for the Cathedral Polish Na-
tionality Room would be, according to
Julius Nagarski, Polish architect, too
impractical. The “crystal Ceiling.”
modelled after the ceiling of the_Ja-
giellonian Library where Copernicus
studied as a student at the University
of Cracow, would have involved dia-
mond-shaped vaulting ﬁnished with
smooth white plaster, In place of this,
Mr. Nagarski suggests a plain wooden
ceiling as being more suitable to the
structure of the Cathedral rooms.

Mr. Nagarski, who arrived from P0-
land last month on the maiden voyage
of the steamship Pilsudski, will spend
three more weeks in Pittsburgh giv-
ing advice on other architectural
plans for the Polish Room.

Meanwhile a Scottish “feast of the

month” last Thursday night made a
third event to be held in the Cathe-
dral’s Commons Room and opened the
fall activities of the Scottish Room
committee, headed by Dr. John B.
Sutherland, professor of physical edu-
cation and head football coach.
. The program of the Scottish cele-
bration was highlighted by the pre-
sentation to the ‘Scottish Room of a
rare print collection of the works of
Robert T. Burns by Mr. and ‘Mrs.
Henry Fraser. The University Glee
Club Quartet and Trombone Quartet
participated in the musical -program,
while Dr. Sutherland presided until
the arrival of James Brown, vice chair-
man of the Scottish Committee, who
was scheduled to act as chairman of
the affair.

   

Knitting.-Addicts,
Star Remodelers

To Get New Tips

Campus women are going to learn
a lot of new things about fashions, ac-
cording to plans of the academic
dress committee. Tentative plans of
the committee call for an all class
meeting on Wednesday, December 4.

It is probable that the program will
be a showing of knitted fashions, and
still a.nother plan would call for a rep--
resenta.tive from the Retail Training
Bureau who would tell the coeds a
thing or two about “The Art of Re-
modeling.” ‘

In addition, the academic dress com-
mittee, of which Carolyn Hall, Ed36,
is chairman, is considering the possi-
bility of engaging a knitting instructor
from a downtown store to aid women
on campus with knitting problems.
Such a project would be carried out
only if the interest shown by women
students seems to warrant 1t.

Other members of the committee
include: Jane Booth, Ed36; Marguerite
Bogaerts, Ed36; Enez Blackburn, C36;
Frances Goodwin, C36; Velva Seyler,

 

C36; Agnes Wilson, Ed36; Alice
Wright, Ed36; Loretta McElwee,
Ed36.

Maulsby Collaborates With Jock
In .‘-‘Picking The Winner”

Dr. John B. Sutherland, head foot-
ball coach, and William S, Maulsby,
former head‘ of the ‘departmentof
journalism’ at the University, have
collaborated 011 an article appearing
in this week’s issue of “The Saturday
Evening Post.” The account is titled
“Picking the VVinner.”

In its main trend, the article at-
tempts to give the reader some basis
for being able to forecast the winner
of a game before the ﬁrst quarter is
over. It lists the factors which make
for victory or defeat as: morale, per-
sonnel, coaching, and luck.

“If we dismiss luck from our calcu-
lations,’’ Dr. Sutherland writes, “I
should say victory is 30 per cent
morale, 40 per cent material, and 30
per cent coaching.” The director of
Panther football fortunes goes on to
cite from examples of players 011 his
teams in illustrating these points.

Illustrating the article are several
photographs of football action and of
Panther players. The most striking
of these is by Luke Swank, University
photographer.

42-year-old “Iron Man of Tennis.” “Isﬂuoke
Camels, the mild cigarette. They don’t get my
wind or upset my nerves. I’ve smoked Camels
for years, and I never tire of their smooth,
rich taste!” And other tennis stars...Lester

agree with Big Bill about smoking Camels. So
turn to Camels. Yoz/ll like their mildness too!
