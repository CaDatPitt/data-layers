Rauck Takes On
Assembly Duties
Ignored By Hart

SFA Executives Approve Members
Chosen For Student Polling;
Dismissal Follows Warnings

W. Gordon Rauck, C37, has become
the newest member of SFA, according
to a report, issued from the executive
committee meeting Wednesday eve-
ning. Rauck replaces Walter Hart,
D37, who, as was shown at the Janu-
ary meeting of the assembly, was

present at only two SFA meetings
this year, the dinner meeting, and
that in which the picture was taken
bythe Owl. -

Rauck is the newly elected presi-
dent of the Kappa Sigma fraternity,
a former track man, and was a mem-
ber of Druids national sophomore
honorary fraternity last year. He is
a member of the Owl’s editorial staff,
and was one of the last ﬁve to be
sent up from the appointments com-
mittee to the executive committee as
candidates for the Junior Prom
chairmanship in December.

Other business carried out by the
executive committee included the ap-
providing of the survey committee as
submitted by Leonard Seder, C37, and
Herbert Rackoff, C38, co—chairmen.
As approved, the committee consists
of William Schenck, BA37, Russell
Connolly, C36, William Blair, C37,
C-ourtland Leigh, C37, Barbara
Thomas, BA37, Jack Levine, BA39,
Betty Black, BA36, and R. F. Black-
burn, assistant professor of statistics.
This committee will begin to function
immediately.

According to Charles Ebert, C36,
member of the executive committee,
a great deal more was accomplished,
but he stated that before it can be
publicized, it must be approved by
the entire assembly. The unspeciﬁed
matter will probably be taken up
.when SlF4A meets next on Tuesday,
March 10. '

Druids To Select
N€W.Me.n..Su.nday,

Two Second - Semester Freshmen
Will Be Named By Honorary

“I can’t say how many men we
will tap,” said Frank Engel, E38, pres-
ident of Druids, yesterday, “but 1 can
say that we will have a11 election
meeting Sunday afternoon at the Pi
Lambda Phi house, and that we have
interviewed severa.l promising candi-
dates.”

The tapping ceremony, according to

Engel, will be held early in March,
with the number of men to be tapped
limited to two. A proposal to revise
“the constitution and make this ﬁgure
unlimited, however, is on the agenda
as new business for Sunday's meet-
ing.

Also to be discussed before any men
are elected, is the entire question of
election procedure. It is expected that
the proposals to be set forth by the
executive committee will meet with
little opposition. These proposals
’call for an unlimited number of tap-
pees in May and February, to be elect-
ed by an entirely new procedure
based, in some ways, upon that now
used by ODK. In the September tap-
ping, which has always occurred con-
currently with the Druid smoker, the
number will still be limited to four
if the revisions are agreed upon, but
it has been proposed that they be
elected by a preferential ballot.

Engel refused to reveal the number
of sophomores who, either by, peti-
tion or nomination from the ﬂoor,
have been proposed as candidates. All
candidates were interviewed Tues-
day by the interviewing committee,
consisting of Engel, Frank Souchak,
C38, Joseph Morrow, C38, and John
Baker, BA38.

The policy of tapping two mid-
semester students was originated last
winter, and has raised the member-
ship of Druids to 18, its maximum
size under its current constitution.

Iowa Jails Crowded,

Not A New Crime Wave, But Weather

‘Case Of Barefoot Girl’

 

It’s not much of a news story if
a girl leaves a pair of galoshes in
an Alumni Hall locker. But if the
girl leaves a pair of snappy brown
pumps in those galoshes, that
might be something else again.

Two students who have appro-
priated a second-ﬂoor locker were
astonished to discover the strange
rubber footgear there several days
ago. They were astonished fur-
ther to discover the shoes inside.

The more they have thought
about this, the more they’ve won-
dered. Just what has happened to
the little girl? Has the world sud-
denly opened and swallowed her
up? Or is she still going about in
Alumni Hall in her stocking feet?

If she is, her feet must be very
sore. She’s been doing it now for
more than a week.

Dancers To Hear
Bray’s Orchestra
At Winter Formal

Jimmy Bray’s ten-man hand, many
members of which double on various
instruments, has been signed for the
College Association VVinter Formal,
taking place a week from tonight at
the Hotel Schenley.

Paul Keiser, ’36, president, and Wil-
liam Hughes, ’36, social chairman of
the Association, release the informa-
tion with the reminder that all money
cleared by the dance goes right into
the CA loan fund, now sadly in need
of replenishment.

“And don’t let anyone forget that
it’s a formal!” they insist, “even
though The Panther, The Compass,
a11d precedent would make them be-
lieve it’s an informal.” It’s a formal
affair next Friday night, if the above
isn’t clear.

Tickets for the dance are on sale
for $1 a couple, setting the affair as
the most inexpensive formal in all
University history, with the exception
of the ﬁrst semester formal of the
same group, also priced at $1.

Bray’s orchestra has become quite
popular at campus affairs, having
played for the Interfraternity Inform-
al Dance last‘ semester,‘ and for - other
affairs in past years. The leader, a
Penn State alumnus, has stocked his
group with a good share of alumni
from the University.

The $1 tickets may be purchased in
the office of the dean of men, Room
801. Cathedral, in the office of the
College, Room 205, State Hall, and are
also on sale with members of the
cabinet.

The CA loan fund, which will re-
ceive all the beneﬁts of the coming
Winter Formal, is now down to a neg-
ligible amount from a former reserve
of about $600. CA loans have proved
extremely popular over the past se-
mester, with the result that an imme-
diate supply of new funds is required
to keep it functioning effectively. Dr.
Omar C. Held, personnel assistant to
the dean of the College and adviser to
the College Association, administers
the fund.

Eberhart Speaks In Radio
Forum On National Defense

 

E. Kingman Eberhart, instructor in
economics, participated in the round
table discussion of ‘‘National Defense”
at the Town Hall Meeting broadcast
over station KDKA Tuesday evening.
The broadcast was under the direc-
tion of Dr. Bernard 0. Clausen and
included several outstanding Pitts-
burghers who along with Mr. Eber-
hart gave: opinions on the subject.

Progressive Educational ,
Group VVilI Convene Here

The Regional Conference of the
Progressive Educational Association,
of which Dr. Pickens E. Harris, Uni-
versity associate professor of educa-
tion, is president, will meet in Pitts-
burgh on April 17 and 18.

Last year more than 1,100 delegates
from Western Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, and Ohio were registered.

Writes Hobbah ,°

 

So you think it’s cold here! How
would you like to go to school with
the temperature hovering about the
30 degrees below zero mark?

That is exactly the situation which
confronts Reginald V. Hobbah, in-
structor of commerce at the Univer-
sity, who is spending the second se-
mester at the State University of
Iowa as ‘an instructor in transporta-
tion. , In a recent letter to Edgar J.
Dowling, who is teaching Mr. Hob-
bah’s courses in the School of Busi-
ness Administration this semester, he
tells a_ few of the diﬁiculties that the
unprecedented cold wave has brought
on the people of Iowa.

Mr. Hobbah reports that there is
an acute shortage of coalin the state.
The situation is so serious that the
fuel has really become precious and
is being closed out at the rate of one-
half ton per family. The police and

ﬁre stations, he relates, are open to
the cold-suffering public. Anyone
wishing to ﬁnd haven and warmth at
these places is called for by officers
and transported there in a police pa-
trol.

At night, according to Mr. Hobbah,
the cold becomes acute. Toward noon,
however, the mercury climbs to zero.
He describes the weather at this tem-
perature as “warm.”

Since the receipt of Mr. Hobbah’s
last letter, newspaper reports have

stated that temperature of 40 or 50
dgrees below zero have been record-
ed there. As a result, his colleagues
here are eagerly awaiting further
news telling of the unusual situation.

Mr. Hobbah is expected to return
here next fall to resume his courses
in commerce. Meanwhile, Mr. Dowl-
ing, a graduate assistant in econom-
ics last semester, is teaching his two
courses in transportation.

Still Remains Unsolved '

News Reviewer Praises Players’ ‘Candida,’

Doesn/t Care Much For George B. Shaw’s

By Charles B. Holstein
(One Man’s Opinion)

If Carl B. Cass were a student of
mine in a play production class, on
the basis of “Candida,” Pitt Players
second major presentation of the year,
which closed a two—day run at the
Civic Playhouse last night, l1e’d rate
a raft of As, A plusses, A double
checks.

But before the Cass horn is tooted
——nay blared—a few other valves in
the Players horn might be pushed
down a11d some praise thrown round
a11d round. For this is the best thing
the Players have done in some time.

First there’s the case of Louise Mc-
Kirdy-, C36, who held the title role in
the production. Dragging herself from
a sickbed the evening of the opening,
she forgot all about la grippe and
minor contributory ailments: for three
acts of a difficult drama, and gener-
ously succeeded in making an uncon-
vincing character as drawn by play-
wright George Bernard Shaw into a
really charming woman. Natural as
get-out, and as effective.

The importance of her role doesn’t
deserve mention for Betty Knop,
Ed37, in this position, but; her emula-
tion of Miss McKirdy in forsaking the
sickroom after a siege of grippe to
carry off the chief comedy relief of
“Candida” does deserve her all the ap-
plause a.nd appreciation audiences
both nights accorded her. _

Few people thought Herrymon
Maurer, C36, could have had it in him.
Recognized as one of the outstanding
undergraduate intellectuals on this or
any campus, Maurer was usually dis-
missed with that. After his perform-

ance in “Candida,” though, he stands
as a capable actor.

And Marquis Patterson, Ed36. One
feels, somehow, that Director Cass
chose “Candida” as 3. Players vehicle
mainly because he had Patterson
available to play a damnably dilficult
role. Patterson did it damnably well.

Any more? Charles Blaker, E37.
Check up one for the Engineers, who
usually don’t shine in this sort of
thing. Cast as a scoundrelly old
cockney, he put authentic typicality
into his part even down to his walk.
Good for some deserved laughs, too.

Rather than pass the remaining
member of the cast off with “He did
a creditable job,” allow me to say that
Shaw put practically nothing in the
part of Reverend Mills to give Wil-
liam Kunkel, C38, a chance to show
anything more than a pleasing appear-
ance and a good voice.

And now my friend, the director.
First score him perfect again on cast
selection. Then consider the actual
direction itself. No group of amateurs
ever shows as well as the “Candida”
cast did unless there’s a director
around who knows his fundamentals-
and some elaborate incidentals be-
sides——and also knows how to impart
his knowledge. Ably assisted by
Charles VV. L. Foreman, G, Cass “went
to town,” as the college boys and
girls say. But, alas, he let us down
on one thing the selection of
the play itself. It was a low B minus.

It isn’t an important piece, nor is
it consistent, nor does it build up a
good case for any of its characters,
nor does it run too smoothly. It
doesn’t hit the spot.

The main thread of its plot concerns
a sincere Christian Socialist minis-
ter who talks too much and under-
stands too little (Maurer), taking on
a young protege (Patterson) who
writes poetry and dwells in the realms
of idealistic and spiritual thought, and
who falls desperately in love with the
mi11ister’s charming wife, Candida,
(Miss McKirdy). Admitting his un-
conventional love to the husband in
the ﬁrst act, the poet writhes through
the rest of the play (a.nd the minister
writhes with him) with the denoue-
ment arriving in Candida’s sense of
duty and of habit tying her to her hus-
band, and she upbraids the 18-year old
poet for trying to shake her James’
self-conﬁdence. Sympathetic for and
appreciative of the poet, and though
she is “above petty concepts of
morality,” she still clings to her
sometimes boring husband, feeling he
is the weaker of the two characters
and needs her more. A poor synopsis,
but it’s a poor play, so Shaw and I are
even.

And take the ﬁnish:

CANDIDA: Good-‘bye. (She takes his
face in her hands kisses his
forehead. Then he gﬂies -out into the
night. She turns to ‘Moi-.rell .)
Ah, James! (They embrace. But the
do not know the secret in the poet’s
heart.)

Finis

Neither do we. Nor does the cast.
Probably only God and Shaw ever
did, with God perhaps a bit vague
about it all. And, since 1893, Shaw
might have forgotten.

Crane Concludes

An

Hovey Finds Art Exhibition

Develops Social Awakening

DepartmentHeadPoints
To Emphasis Upon
Local Scenes

By Sydney Horovitz

*'I‘he twenty-sixth annual exhibition
of the Associated Artists of Pitts-
burgh strikes Walter R. Hovey, pro-
fessor and acting head of the ﬁne arts
department, as the best show ever
collected by the group. In contrast
was the opinion expressed by Douglas
Naylor, art critic for The Pittsburgh
Press.

The most signiﬁcant feature pointed
out by Mr. Hovey is the trend toward
an awakening of social consciousness
in art. Increased treatment and em-
phasis on the Negro problem and a
directness and reality in the creation
of proletarian and poverty-ridden
scenes were indicated as evidence of
this movement.

“This social consci-ousness arises,”
said Mr. Hovey, “from a realization of
the splendid skill and interest of ar-
tists in the Communist movement, in
cartoons for the New Masses, and in
the picturesqueness of the Negro
problem and the social scene.”

The lack of ﬁgure studies and of
the studio atmosphere, Mr. Hovey felt,
is a healthy sign inasmuch as it re-
veals the artists looking around-at
their local scenes and environment.
“The artiﬁciality of the studio,” he
believes, “is splendid for study, but
not an end in itself.”

Other inﬂuences found in the show
at the Carnegie Institute galleries are
that of John Kane (the primiti-ve im-
pression and the detailed rendering of
loca.l scene) and that of this year’s In-
ternational Art Exhibit.

Approves Prize-Winners

Mr. Hovey regarded the prize
awards as deserving, with the excep-
tion of “Winter Morning” by Godfrey
Biehl. “Autumn in Pittsburgh” by
Samuel Rosenberg. a.nd “Case Rec-
ords” by Leland Knoch impressed him
as particularly meritorious and worthy
of being purchased for the permanent
collection.

Credit should be given to Andrew
Kostellow, Mr. Hovey acknowledged,
as the man who has contributed most
to raise the general level of the ex-
hibits, although his work this year is
not outstanding.

“It is interesting,” said Mr. Hovey,
“to watch the interest and develop-
ment in regard to the crafts, especial-
ly ceramics. The water colors are
not up to the standard of the oils, b-ut
more development is expected in this
ﬁeld since it is not featured in the
International and is a medium more
suited to amateurs. Although more
diflicult technically, it is not so com-
plicated as work with oils.

“Particularly ﬁne pieces are thc
‘Crooked Street’ water color by A.
James Speyer and the ceramic head
by Thomas W. Patterson.”

On the whole, interest in the show
is increasing, according to Mr. Hovey.
The fact that the prizes were of more
or less equal amounts seemed to him
to encourage the entrants and to con-
tribute to the interest in the exhibit
as a whole, rather than as a. few spe-
ciﬁc pictures-

YM- YWCA To Begin
Fellowship Series
For Fifth Hours

‘Fellowship groups sponsored by the
YM-YVVCA will explore the four prin-

picles of “The Christian Revolution”
during Monday ﬁfth hours from Feb-
ruary 24 to March 16, and during
Wednesday ﬁfth hours from February
26 to March 18. This is planned as a
part of the “Do Something About It”
program, begun with Dr. Crane’s ad-
dresses.

These four weeks of discussion will
be conducted to probe into Christian
philosophy and its meaning to people
today and to society. The four prin-
ciples of the Christian Revolution
that have been chosen as the basis

, of the discussions are:

1. That people are the most im-
portant consideration in the world to-
day as they have always necessarily
been. Aside from people the world
is meaningless.

2. That people belong together,
and that anything that separates
-them is wrong.

3. That ambition is best satisﬁed
by service to others.

4. That ‘I goodwill is a method-' of
social progress.

Students interested in attending
either of the discussion groups, ‘may
sign a card at the YWCA office at
Heinz House, or at the YMCA office
in Room 801, Cathedral.

, FREE--But It’s

Women’s Rushing
Crimps Elaborate
Program Of Men

Fraternity Seasons’ Concurrence
Embarrassing To l‘!Ial.e Groups
Sans The Required “Dates”

Once again the men's fraternities
are beginning to realize how unwise
they have been in scheduling their
rushing season in such C1039 prox-
imity, and in fact, concurrence, with
the biggest women’s.social period of
the year.

For while the women go on, more
or less content to obey the injunction
which absolutely prohibits men at‘
their rushing affairs, the fraternity
boys are having a tough time getting
dates for the numerous dances which
stud the week-end. The men may not
have any laws preventing women
from their rushing affairs, but they-
might as well have, from all reports.

At any rate, the last cablegrams
from the front stated that all was
going well, if a little more peacefully
than usual. If there was a little
more quiet than is common in rushing
season, perhaps it was because the
tactics employed xwere of a less
ho.s.tile,na,ture,* or perha.p,s it was be-
cause there are less than 60 new
men for whom the fraternities are
competing.

The commotion, or lack of it, will be
over at 2 o’clock Sunday morning,
whereafter begins a period of silence
which lasts well into Thursday after-
noon. At 5 o’clock, however, the fra-
ternity men will crowd into Room
801, Cathedral, and receive their bids,
either accepted, rejected, or declined.
The rejection indicates that the man
receiving bids did not pledge any fra-
ternity, and the declining shows that
he accepted another bid.

All through silence week the men
who have been bid will be called into
the office of the dean of men and
asked to state their preferences, if
any, in fraternity matters. And on
Thursday afternoon, the silence will
be shattered when all the new pledges
to-be will congregate at their chosen
fraternities.

This all sounds like a huge confu-
sion of whirling and riot, yet to bring
rushing season dpwn to cold hard
ﬁgures,’ any fraternity 'which gets’
more than 3 pledges will have done
twice as well as the’ average house
did last semester.

McKay May Seek  
Seat In Congress

With Democratic Party Support,
Professor Would Make Race

 

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor of
economics, has announced his will-
ingness to-. r-un«on- the -Democratic tick-
et as the representative of the 33rd
district in the national House of Rep-
resentatives.

This statement was veriﬁed by Dr.-
McKay after he had so notiﬁed the
leaders of the Democratic party. So
far no other candidacy has been an-
nounced. The only other person who
has mentioned running in opposition
to McKay is Mayor Milliam N, Mc-
Nair.  The -Mayor;—:-h'owev.,er, .=.has?' not
-yet made his statement official.

In explaining his decision to run
as a. representative to the lower house
of Congress, Dr. McKay said, “A great
many have urged me to run for the
position and 1 have notiﬁed party
leaders of my willingness to do so.
However, I will not run unless the
Democratic organization will back
me.”

Dr. McKay further declared that he
would not run on any -other ticket,
declaring that he did not believe in
changing his party affiliations mere
ly to obtain an office. ~

In referring to his qualiﬁcations for
office Dr, McKay stated that he had
served on the Federal Tax Commit-
tee on Housing under the Hoover
adniinistration, the State Tax Com
mittee from 1924-1927, '-Governor
Eai-le’s Special Tax Committee, and
for four years has been president of

the Allegheny County Civic Club.

’It’s The Schenley Again, It’s Still

Not Till April First

 

It may be that The News was short
of stories of any importance for this
issue and that Ellis H. Tumpson,
BA36, business manager, made his
weekly remark that the semesterly
Pitt News Style Show and Dance
will, ho-hum,'soon‘ be around again.‘

Possibly not.

Regardless, after having done this
same thing for four years now in is-
sue after issue, one can’t write with
too much of a fresh attitude. There’s
a style show and dance, sponsored
by The Pitt News coming up soon, ho
hum, and it’s scheduled for April 1,
if that can be considered soon.

Everyone except brand, brand new
freshmen knows all about Pitt News
Style Shows and Dances . free
of course to all who come, with the
bill taken care of by Tumpson’s busi-
ness staﬁ stooges.

It's all very thrilling to us in‘The
News office. We’re always praised in
print (by ourselves, of course) for
giving this nice, grand, big, swell

party to the campus free. After it’s

over, occasional freshmen thank us
for our treat. But while it’s in ses-
sion, here 'we are up in the oﬂice
banging away on those *!-&-@/$ type-
writers and inserting commas where
carel__ess '_reporters' 1'nsi_st* on -placing
dollar signs" or "something. ' Once the
staff got to a style show and dance
the paper sponsored, but everyone
was ﬁred and the Scriptsists, or some
other freshman unit of those days
put out the paper for an issue. A re-
sulting jump in circulation made us
all worried for our jobs, so we stick
around now,.style show, or what.
Incidentally, in preparation for this
big event, the business staff will soon
print a ballot on which students will
vote for themselves as models in the
show. . ~
But that comes later. For today, may
a weary writer of style show stories
for‘ four‘ years now." (a' long." time in
any language) beg to remind one and
all that The Pitt News, ho hum, has
one of those style show and dance
things coming up April 1.——By Ron.

pass without some sort of editorial comment.
The theme of these collegiate editorials depends
upon-‘whether or not the writer is a fraternity

 

man‘; it’s mighty hard to get away from that. For ,

thisreason, it 's probably just as well that fresh-
men being rushed don ’t always have to turn to the
editorial columns of the paper for advice.

Tlicre are some very beautifully done exposi-
tions which point out to the freshman the ease
and values of fraternity life, so that the average
bewildered young traveler comes into a state of
l‘«elief.that he-mig-lit as well pack up and go back
to Shickshinnv if he can’t afford to Join a frater-
nity. .

There" are also some bristling bits based on the

idea -that the Greek brothers tell you all the good .

and somebody else had better tell you all the bad
things about the fraternity system. They advise

the young fellows to remember that “the fraterni- '

ties are out to get you. They need men as urgent-
ly as Mussolini needs soldier. ."’ Always there is
included the warning to beware of the milk and
l10l1ey~'t‘I‘e2ttl11€‘llt'}'OI1 receive as a rushee; the treat-
ment changes its character, it is averred, after the
pledging.

Nobody seems to care much for the idea of strad-
dling the fence, but this question above all others
is perhaps best approached by that straddling
method. After all, the rushees go into this thing
with eyes wide open and they are almost always
old enough toknow what’s going on.

It should be only natural that a fellow who is
taken alone into the back room or upstairs to
--“meet the bI‘0tlier who is sick in bed” should re-
-”se’fit it lwheii the actives begin to tighten down the
:'screws on him there. He should be apt enough to

rsee through obvious veneer and to understandthat

it isthe _sophomores and freshmen of the house,
‘those with whom he will have to live, upon whom
'-he should direct his scrutiny and make his ap-
'praisals'. 'And it won ’t take a whole lot of brains
for him to realize that fraternity ai’ﬁli'ations on this
campus don't out much. ice in activities or politics.

But he shouldn’t b-e scared away too easily. The
fraternities are serving a purpose or they wouldn’t
be here; If his purse is long enough and he can

"ﬁnd a group to his liking, there are a lot worse ‘I

things that can happen to him in college than join-
ing a fraternity. ” 7 ‘

Maybe the best thing for the undergraduate edi- :

torialwvriters to say is: Take advantage of all

rushing invitations and use your head when you

-attend the functions, don’t be bothered about the

number of bids you do or do not receive, and then
. make up your own mind.

As an experiment, Chicago Uin‘-versit_v’s daily -

paper is doing without any capital letters. Some-
how wc’re more syiiipathetic with the papers
wliicli are getting along without any capital.

Editorial or The Week I

A Campus Viewpoint

 

The true solution of the “no cheating” problem that ‘

has arisen on the campus seems to be clear cut. It lies
with the individual members of the student body who

must, through dictates of their own consciences, see that 3

nothing is to be gained tlircugh cribbing practices. With

the students taking the attack upon their integrity as :1 '
personal affront and determining to prove that they are 
essentially honest in classrooms, what cheating there is 2

will be minimized.

That cheating has reached such a perilous state as
some believe is ratlier doubtful. but it is none the less
present and should be combatted. It does not, however.

seem that it should rest with the faculty alone, or with '

the installation of a vigilante committee, or proctors.

The surest way to foster anything wrong is to make the i

students think that they are being dared to cheat.
this the watchdog system would undoubtedly lead.

It is essentially a personal matter and by such treat-
ment the solution is simple. Inborn honesty would not
allow you to talce ri two-cent newspaper without dropping
the two pennies in the unattended news rack;
much: is it the sincere belief of the leaders of this stu-

To

dent body that you would not “clieapen" yourself by -

cribbing in an exaiiiiiiatioii. The gain is small, if it

exists at all; the loss is great and the blemish on your

integrity as it rests in your own mind is irreparable-

‘ Grades mean little, but you must live with yourself

always.

Harry Robinson, sports editor, didn’t need help, for it
change. in getting a date for the Interfraternity Ball.
He called Allegheny College (45 cents!) and in came
the heart throb. Robinson, by the way, took her to a
recent basketball game, where his assistant, Bill Trosen,
seeing her apparently unescorted, tried to pick her up.
Troseu will go back to the cross country beat, it’s
rumored. .

Chuck Holstein thought seriously of signing up for
Carl B. Cass’ play production class . . He’s the only
witness to a 133 game bowled by the Players‘ director
one afternoon. Holstein, by the by, got a. national cir-
culation this week again (last week it was in Variety,
the theatrical weekly) with his picture on page 15 of
the current issue of Co1lier‘s magazine. Snap was made
three months ago by Co1lier’s Ifor Thomas when Hol-
stein was a eunuch with the Bullet Russe. Pottsville

What little lady with beautiful eyes decided to go
to bed instead of the I-F Ball after a few hours of

she’s a member of Delta Zeta.

Fraternity Fcibles

One of the prize possessions of the Phi Eps is a new-
ly acquired dog which the boys can call almost any
unprintable name and still be accurate.

Goldberg and Tumpson are still eligible rushees, think
the Pi Lambs. (The Phi Eps gave up after three and a
half years.) Maybe it all comes down to the fact that

. ODK Brother Racusin, now Pi Lam president, has been

forced to feel his responsibilities and keep the boys fair-
ly well fed. Maybe not. Phi Kappa is next o-n their
list, say Gold. & Tump.

Why Should it?

Installation of a liquor store on Center Avenue, right
under the alleys at which fraternity teams bowl, hasn't
seemed to make any difference.

Phi Delta Theta’s opening match
high approached the previous tourney

Lambda Chi Alpha had a stiff ﬁght

Classy Irish Five
Tomorrow Night

Notre Dame Passers Top Schools
In Mid-West With Record
Of 10 Straight Victories

Out in South Bend tomorrow night
the Panther basketeers get another
opportunity to break a long winning
streak as they battle Notre Dame’s
crack ﬁve. Under almost similar
circumstances as the Duke affair
Tuesday, the game offers the Pan-
thers a chance to even up the sea-
son’s series with the Irish.

Thus far this season the Notre
Dame boys have been the standout
team of the mid-west. They have
raced through their 19 games with the
loss or only one game, that to Purdue,
.-and an unusual tie game with North-
western. The last ten of the victor-
ies have come in a row, nearly every
one of them in easy fashion.

In the ﬁrst game against the Irish,
the Golden Panthers, playing at the
Stadium, fell under a last half rally,
and the Notre Dame boys went home
with a 43-35 victory. It was rather
a sloppily played game, with each
team putting on ﬂashes of excellent
basketball and then lapsing into a
coma of some sort or another.

Tomorrow night, however, will
probably ﬁnd both teams at their
best. Both of them have turned in
remarkable performances in their
last few games. The Irish dropped
Kentucky, 42-20, and New York US
great team, 38-27, while the Panthers
have come from behind in each of
their last two tilts to wi11 at Tem-
ple last Saturday, and against the
Dukes on Tuesday.

It is probable that both coaches
will start their so-called second teams.

Panther Relayers
Invade New York
For NAAU Meet

Thomas, McConnell, Connelly,
Groat Will Head Eastward
Today For National Event

 

 

Coach Olson’s mile relayers move
into New York tomorrow for their
second assault on the Madison Square
Garden indoor boards. The National
AAU championships mark the second
time in three weeks that the Panther
quartet performs before an expected
crowd of 19.000 Gothamites.

In the Millrose Games three weeks
ago, the Panthers chased a ﬁne Holy
Cross combination, acclaimed by
many as the best in the East, across
the ﬁnish line in the fastest race of
the six-event relay program. At the
same time, the Pitt boys compiled the
second-best mark of the evening in a.
field of 12 collegiate outﬁts.

La.st Tuesday, the University of
Michigan, Big Ten champs, nosed out
the Panther team by inches in a feat-
ure ra.ce at the Michigan Relays. Pitt
led the Ann Arbor boys for the entire
race with the exception of the latter
half of the “gun” lap. In this quarter,
I-Iarold Connelly, indoor record-holder”,
failed to hold a substantial lead es-
tablished by Art Thomas, James Mc-
Connell, and Charles Groat, losing by
less than half a stride.

The Panther party plans to leave
early this morning for the AAU event.
There is a possibility that Pete Ben-
nett, ace high jumper, Dick Mason
and S01 Menaker, sprinters, and sev-
eral other varsity runners may accom-
pany the relay team to the National
championships.

In March, a Panther entry will com-
pete in the IC4A championships, the
Central Intercollegiate track and ﬁeld
championship at South Bend, and ‘sev-
eral possible dual meets in prepara-
tion for the outdoor season.

Noon Whistle Sounds Often
As Cagers Trample Dukes

Johnson, Radvansky, Noon Direct Second-half Uprising
As Panthers Rally To Upset Hilltoppers, 46-41

 

 

Noontime came late Tuesday. at th

the eight-game winning streak of Duquesne’s “perfect” cage team with a

grand and glorious 46-41 victory. But
Pete Noon far out in the limelight w

that netted 19 timely and mighty important points.

e Stadium when the Panthers cracked

once it did come, it placed towering
ith his barrage on the Duke baskets

It was one of those games that willfv‘

not soon be forgotten by the 4,000
spectators that were there. Going
into the last half under a nine-point
handicap, 'Pit't"s Golden Panthers
ﬂashed a whirlwind attack, paced by

Noon, that saw the Cats creep up on
the favored Dukes, pass them, and
then go far out into the front to Win
the sweetest Panther victory of the
year.

Unfortunately for the Dukes and
their ﬁne record, it was one of strap-
ping Pete Noon’s “on” nighl'-S- In the
ﬁrst half Pete tossed in 7 of the Pan-
ther’s total’ of 16 points. In the ﬁnal
ﬁve minutes, Pete ran wild again to
score six more baskets. It was per-
haps Noon’s greatest game.

However the Brownsville boy was
not the only one deserving the hon-
ors, for Bob Johnson and Rags Ra<1Va11'
sky stepped in and made the night
pretty terrible for the Dukes. Each
scored nine points and they came at
timely spots in the game.

Panthers Trail At Half

From the opening shot_of the b_al1
game. the entire 40 minutes were
packed- with more thrills than a
Hindu spike-sitter experiences. Both
the Panthers and the Dukes opened
up strong, with the result that the
score was tied three times, 4-4, 7-7,
11-11, in the first ten minutes. In the
next 10, the sharpshooting.Dukes went
off on one of their habitual scoring
sprees, so that when the half ended,
the Panther cause looked dismal
enough with a 25-16 score against
them.

Coming out of the shower rooms
again, the Panthers began to creep
up on their city rivals. VVith Johnson,
Radvansky, and Noon bearing the
brunt of the basket-making the Pan-
thers had moved up to within four
points of Davies team, 34-30, with ten
minutes gone. Radvansky and M3‘
lackney both popped in a field 8031
and the fun began.

In the next seven minutes the roar-
ing Panthers batted in 14 straight
points while the Dukes did nothing
whatsoever with the ball. It was
Johnson who started it, then Roder-
ick, Johnson again, Noon twice,_Rad-
vansky, and Noon twice more, and
the game was practically over.

Yearlings Whip Duke Frosh

In the preliminary to the ‘game,

Clash Tomorrow Night At Metro
Pool In Important ESA Meet

Two of’ the leading contenders for
the Eastern Swimming Association
title, Pitt and Franklin and Marshall,
will tangle tomorrow night in the
Metropolitan pool, and the chances
are that the winner of the meet will

CYOWD.

Tomorrow’s duel will also settle a‘
private feud that was set up as a re-
sult of last year’s meet. It seems that
there’s a diversity of opinion as to
which team won that contest. When
the meet was concluded, F&M’s out-
ﬁt was announced as winner- by .a
score of 35-33.

A couple of weeks later a new re-
sult ca.me out in the press, whereby
the Panthers were given the nod by
a 36-35 decision. All the trouble was

The Panthers won that particular
race and maintained that it should
count eight points. F&M gave the
Pitt team ﬁve markers for the first
place, and consequently the 35-33 total
resulted. On the recount eight points
were allowed for the relay ﬁrst place
and that change "brought the Pitt
score up to 36.

Lindberg Shifted To Backstroke

Due to the loss of Joe Jones, vet-
eran backstrokeartist who graduated
at mid-semester, Coach Corr has had
to shift Captain Russ Lindberg to the
150-yard backstroke, thus weakening
the Pitt scoring power in the 50-yard
sprint. Lindberg will handle the as-
signment in the century free style
and the anchor position on the relay
quartet.

Tom Locke. sophomore sensation,
will encounter his toughest opposition
since the Ohio State meet in the 220-
yard event where he will bump up
against Oscar Foder. Foder has been
doing this event consistently in the
record time of 2 minutes, 20 seconds.

Ozzie Sola, who won the 50 and ﬁn-
ished second in the 100, will be back
to compete in his favorite events.
Johnny VVet.zel in the breaststroke
and Don Chalmers are a couple of
other F&M stars who are almost cer-
tain point scorers for the eastern
school.

Coach Corr will probably rely on
the same lineup that beat Penn State
last Saturday, using Geyer and Prince
in the 50, Lindberg and Prince in the
100, Anderson in the breaststroke,
Stiranko and Lindberg in the back-
stroke, Locke and Lavine in the dis-
tance events, and McQuillan, Myers,

Wilson Prepares
Swedish Designs

Decorator Submits Two Schemes
For Portrayal Of Nationality

Two different schemes for the de-
signing of the Swedish Room in the
Cathedral have been submitted to the

University by Linton R. Wilson, de-
signer of the room.

The purpose of the Swedish Room
in the Cathedral is expression of
Swedish culture in a foreign land,
and serviceability- as a classroom.

With this purpose in mind, Mr. Wil-
son spent six weeks abroad last sum-
mer to study the Swedish culture.
The designer visited the Northeren
Museum, and Skansen.‘ He selected
the peasant style as the theme for
the room, because it showed variety
and combined the two rock-bottom
charactertistics of simplicity and dig-
nity with bright decorative effects.

One scheme for the room shows a
white-washed wooden room with plain
‘ﬁr planks on the floor, and timbered
ceiling. _The four walls and ceiling
are to be richly decorated in color. A
white-washed ﬁreplace and a dull blue
bench on three sides of the room
would add to its charm. ,

The other scheme which Mr. Wil-
son has prepared shows _a room with
a wooden ceiling, gayly painted. One
wall will be richly decorated, while
the other walls will be of highly paint-
ed brick. This plan (falls for a dull
red bench and a ﬂoor of bright red
brick.

Both plans are predominantly white
in feeling, as a background to the gay
colors of the decorations. Everything
about the room is to be cheerful, but
at the same time digniﬁed.

Mr. Wilson consulted with Carl
Milles, the well known painter, about
the designs for the room before he
submitted them to the University.

Publications Unit Clears
, Deficit By Orange Party

For fun and for money, the fresh-
man publications unit held an orange
party Tuesday. To make up a deficit
in the unit budget, the group decided
to charge admission to the affair ac-
cording to the number of seeds in the
oranges which were presented to each
member as she entered. Persons pos-
sessing oranges without seeds were
assessed 25 cents.

Continuing the theme of the party,
orange juice was served with cookies
donated by the members. The deﬁcit,
which had been 85 cents, is no longer.

The committee in charge of the af-
fair was headed by Mary Lewis, C,
and Betty Jane Martin, C, program
and social chairmen, respectively.

of A LIGHT SMOKE is the pri-

This preheating process at higher
temperatures consists of four main

stages, which involve carefully con-
trolled temperature gradations.
Quantities of undesirable constitu-
ents are removed. In effect, then,
this method of preheating at higher

temperatures constitutes a comple-
