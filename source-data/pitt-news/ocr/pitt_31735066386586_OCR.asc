WPIC opens new schizophrenia center

By Jennifer Spiro
Stajf wmer

Western Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic has opened a Schizophrenia
Treatment and Research Center,
which will treat schizophrenics
and conduct research to find the
origins of schizophrenia.

“We do studies on the problem
of the functioning of the brain —
of other genetic difficulties. We’re
doing research on this because
we really need to know why this
disease occurs. But meantime,
you can't just wait until you find
out in order to provide the best
possible available treatment,” said

Dr. Rohan Ganguli, an associate
professor of psychiatry and
pathology.

The new center, located at 3501
Forbes Ave., will condense several
programs which were previously
housed within different branches
of WPIC.

The treatment available to the
patients includes medication,
individual and group therapy and
art therapy. According to Ganguli,
art is an important key for patients
seeking communication.

“Art is used. It’s not a hobby;
this is not for recreation. This is
really a way of expressing
themselves. It’s making use of the

parts of the brain that are not
affected. Schizophrenia affects
preferentially language function.
Sometimes it’s a very new
experience for patients who have
really shut up because they've
spent years trying to say things
and not having anyone
understand it," Ganguli said.

According to Ganguli, along
with medical and psychiatric
treatment, the center also teaches
the patients various living and
vocational skills.

“[With schizophrenia], it’s not
everything that goes; some things
patients are very skilled at. Using
computers, interestingly enough,

is something some schizophrenics
are very good at. We actually
have employed at the university
several patients who didn't work
for 20 or 50 years. We have set up
here a training center where we
train people in various computer-
related tasks," he said.

The self-expression of art
therapy and the learning of
vocational skills help the patients
deal with the disease, said
Ganguli.

“People have to work at living
with a chronic disability which is
not evident to anybody else. If
you look at somebody with

Pitt business school just misses top rankings

By Lane Hornfeck
saw’ Writer

Pitt just missed Business Week’s Top 20
ranking of graduate business schools.

According to statistics found in the Oct. 29
edition, thejoseph M. Katz School of Business
is the first runner—up to the national Top 20
ranking.

The ranking results consisted of opinions
from 149 corporations who hire graduates
and of 1,339 business graduates themselves.

Carnegie Mellon fell in at the ninth spot,
with its graduates having an average starting
pay of $56,890. Pitt, although it is a national

school, was not too far behind, with the 21st
spot and an average starting pay of $40,100.

Diane Shinn, director of communications
at Pitt’s business school, said, “We don’t
consider Carnegie Mellon to be a competitor.
It is a small, private school; we are not.”

Also according to Shinn, “The school is
gaining in national prominence because the
word is getting out; more people know about
the improvements and changes the school
has made.

“These improvements and changes have
not been all of a sudden. They have been
gradual, and the fact that the school is gaining
such immense publicity just means that the

changes and improvements are also. Good,
solid fund raising has been a great addition to
the effort,” said Shinn.

Shinn said that the business world is taking
notice of Pitt’s business school.

“[CorporationsI come back to get our
students, and the students who graduate
promote us within their own companies,”
she said.

“The prestige is sort of in a circle. Everything
is starting to improve —— gain in prominence.
Everything else should just follow.”

The fact that Pitt has come so close to
making the Top 20 shows that “Pitt is on its
way up,” she said.

Surgeon Wants hospitals to increase community care

.. By Jennifer Skriba

Staﬁ’ Writer

Howard Yonas, M.D., knew
when he was very young that
medicine would play a signiﬁcant
role in his life. He began in high
school working summers at a

“ state mental hospital in Cleveland,

Ohio.

Recently, Yonas was been
appointed chief of neurosurgery
at Monteﬁore Hospital.

“I have always been interested
in medicine —— in junior high and
high school,” said Yonas.
“[Medicine] just felt right for me.”

., Yonas chose neurosurgery as

his specialty because “it’s a
demanding field; it’s an
intellectually challenging field. I
like big challenges.” He said
neurosurgery is thought of by
many to be the queen of the
surgical specialties.

Neurosurgery is one of the more
complicated surgical areas
because one must be not only a
neurologist but also a
neurosurgeon, according to
Yonas. “There is a lot to be done.
There is a whole lot to learn,”
said Yonas. Neurology is the
scientiﬁc study of the nervous
system, while neurosurgery deals
with surgery involving the brain,
spinal cord, nerves and other
nervous—system structures.

New technology is evolving all
the time. Yonas worked as part of
a team on the invention of a new
technology called stable xenon
enhanced computerized
tomographic cerebral blood ﬂow,
a type of blood-ﬂow imaging.

They determined that blood
flow in the brain could be seen
on a CT scanner and could
measure blood ﬂow in any area
of the brain. The group began

work on the project in 1977 and
1978 and since then has sold it
worldwide.

“In the last four or five years we
used it to learn and guide the
management of a lot of very
serious medical problems,” Yonas
said. “We are using some of the
technology as a major building
block to identifying key people
who are at risk for stroke.”

Yonas earned his bachelor of

science degree in chemistry at
Pitt in 1966. He then graduated
from Ohio State Medical School.
After spending one year at Case
Western Reserve University for
an internship, Yonas was drafted
into the Air Force during the
Vietnam War.

Yonas worked as a ﬂight
medical officer/ﬂight surgeon in
the United States Air Force for
two years. He ﬂew with jet-ﬁghter

trainers and took care of the

pilots and their families. “It was a

good time,” Yonas said
Yonas ietumed to Case Western
to complete his four—year
residency in neurosurgery. He
then completed two microsurgery
fellowships —— one in Zurich,
Switzerland and the other at Pitt.
Pittsburgh became Yonas’
home. Prior to his appointment

individuals attempted to enter
the ballroom after the doors were
closed. Harmon added that the
perpetrators were believed to be
some of the visiting students who
were denied entry to the dance.

Cavalla said that the interior
door connecting the WPU’s
Kurtzman Room and Assembly
Room sustained damage to its
frame when the individuals
attempted to use the door as an

alternative entrance.

Later, several individuals
opened an exterior door at the
garage entrance behind the
Schenley Cafe on the ground
level of the WPU, apparently for
the same reason, according to
Cavalla. Cavalla said that these
students may or may not have
been the same ones who
damaged the interior door.

“Individuals did get downstairs
and were running around," said

Harmon. “They weren’t
authorized to be in the area.”
Cavalla said that a ﬁre alarm
located in the catacombs beneath
the WPU was activated at 11:30
p.m. He said that it was probably
another attempt by the individuals
to enter the dance. During the
confusion of the fire alarm,
someone took the admittance
stamp and ink pad that was used
to indicate which persons were
allowed to enter the dance,

Cavalla added.

While the crowd outside the
union waited to be readmitted, a
person or persons administered
hand stamps to other people in
the crowd, conﬁrmed Booth.

“I think [these events] will call
into question whether or not we
want to open our dances to the
general public,” said Harmon.

Cavalla said that a new
identification system involving
wristbands instead of hand stamps
will be introduced in the future to
deter a similar incident. He said
the wristband method has been
used successfully for several years

 

at West Virginia University. 3*

“We hope to have them in by
the dance this Friday,” said
Cavalla.

Harmon said that the actual
damage accrued was nominal and
that Kappa Alpha Psi will be
assessed for the cost. ,,.t

Cavalla said that further
deliberation is necessary before
any action is taken against Kappa
Alpha Psi.

“Some of this, I think, was bey-
ond their control," said Harmon.
He added that an organization
which holds an event must be
able to reasonably protect guests.‘

years and many challenges as
well,” he said. “I take this
opportunity to congratulate the
1991 Student Government Board,
and I ask them, and all of you
here tonight, for your help,
suggestions and support, so we
may meet these challenges.”

This year the 1991 board was
inducted in November 1990
instead of January 1991.
According to Theresa Wilson,
elections-committee chairperson,
the elections committee decided
to change the induction date in

14

order to alleviate any problems
in the transition between the two
boards.

“Our constitution says that [the
new board] should take office on
the first day of the spring term -
Jan. 1. But usually it isn’t until late

January that we actually get them 35"

inducted,” she said.

“It eases the transition,” she
said. “It allows new and old board
members to get a chance to
interact. Often we have a board
member who graduates in
December, so they aren’t around
to help out the new board.”

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, November 28, 1990

Yonas

Continued from page 3
at Montefrore, Yonas worked at
Presbyterian University Hospital,
Children’s Hospital, Eye and Ear
Hospital, the Veterans Hospital
and a hospital in‘Harmarville.

In addition to his duties as
chief of neurosurgery, Yonas is
also the director of Pitt’s Stroke
Prevention Center, which he
describes as “a multi-disciplinary
group of neurologists,
radiologists, vascular surgeons
and neurosurgeons who are
involved in an outpatient clinic
for the evaluation of patients with
cerebrovascular problems.”

The group of doctors reviews
each patient on an outpatient
basis and comes up with a
consensus opinion. The families
get the benefit of four doctors
rather than one.

“A clinic in the university is not
only a treatment; it’s research
based,” Yonas said. “It’s a chance
for following a lot of people and
helping in their care but also
putting together studies to learn
about the diseases these people
have.”

Yonas said he would like to
expand on this outpatient service
and develop an inpatient program
for the treatment of cerebro-
vascular disorders.

“We could provide intensive
care for the acute stroke victim
and interface all the technology
we’ve evolved to be able to treat
people aggressively and see if we
can turn around some strokes
and other bad problems,” he said.

Yonas is also a teacher. He is
associate professor of
neurosurgery and radiology at
the University of Pittsburgh Med-
ical Center.

He teaches residents, fellows
and people from around the world
in the operating room, and he
also travels to lecture about the
stable-xenon technology he
helped to develop. He has
lectured in Japan, Hong Kong,
Germany and Los Angeles.

“One not only provides
hopefully the best of care for
people but one learns how to
provide that and then is able to
share that with clinicians around
the world,” Yonas said.

“That way you not only affect
the care of the few people you
can see in your lifetime, but
hopefully you can affect the care
of thousands of people around
the world,” he said.

Above all, Yonas likes being a
surgeon. “I’m most comfortable
in the operating room, being a
surgeon. There are certain areas
we have gotten very good at,”
Yonas said.

As a new administrator at
Montefiore, Yonas said the
hospital has many missions now
that it is part of the university.
Yonas would like to fill up the
hospital, which he said has not
been fully utilized.“We can fill up
the hospital; half with university
research—directed programs and
the other half with community-
based quality patient care,” Yonas
said.

“This particular facility is

because the esteem has improved.

If the facility doesn't look good,
if they feel left out, then they
obviously will have low self-

Panhel

Continued from page 1
Meyers voiced her concern with
being fair and unbiased.

“The internal vice president of
Panhel has to be unbiased, open
and concerned for all matters
relating to each house in this
association. It is important for
Panhellenic to create and maintain
unity,” Meyers said.

Darya Lehrich, Delta Zeta,
defeated Kathleen Hogle, Kappa
Delta, for the position of external
vice president. Lehrich will
concentrate her time on creating
more inter—sorority mixers, having
sororities take a more active role
in Lantern Night, having an
awards banquet, promoting
intramural sports such as powder-
puff football, creating better
communications between
sororities and having every
member of the board type a copy
of all of their goals for the term.

Increasing the overall quality-
point average of Greeks,
sponsoring non—alcoholic events,
encouraging Greek 101 and
continuing the mystagogue-
mystagee program are also among
her goals.

Tanya Lasher, Kappa Alpha
Theta, succeeded in acquiring
the position of treasurer over
Rebecca Pappas, Kappa Delta.
Creating and maintaining a budget
and communications with each
sorority about how funds are
spent are among her promises.
“You are contributing the dues,
and you should know how [the
money] is being spent. If you
disagree on how it’s being spent,
you should have a voice  I will
always be available to discuss
any discrepancies,” Lasher said.

Laura Fischer, Chi Omega;
Susan Swiderski, Kappa Alpha
Theta; and Alicia Barry, Sigma
Sigma Sigma ran for secretary.
After voting twice and having a
three—way tie on both occasions,
the current executive board chose
Barry, who is currently the
president of her sorority, for the
position. Barry will work to
improve correspondence among
sororities, create a cor-
respondence log, publish a phone
list and phone chain to make
communication easier and
instituting a Panhel history book.

Umon, union, union. ..

One of the strongest bargaining chips available to
workers in this country during negotiations is a union.
When people feel that they are being treated unfairly, they
go to their union leaders, and in turn, their grievances are
brought to the attention of their employers.

Now the University of Pittsburgh is facing this same

"* situation. On Nov. 19, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations

Board gave its approval to Pitt faculty members to vote
whether or not they should unionize.

Previously, a Supreme Court decision in 1980 had
banned the unionization of full-time faculty members
because a group of them were considered to be managerial
employees.

l3itt"§ taeulty members had been attempting to gain the

3 right of unionization since 1982, a move that the university

staunchly opposed. Since they have gained this right, the
faculty members should take full advantage of the situation
now. This is an opportunity for them to show the
university that they will not be taken advantage of.

This is an ideal time for the faculty to vote on unionization.
The university is currently searching for a new president
to succeed Wesley Posvar. If the new president comes to
this university facing a unionized faculty, the union will
have more power than if they unionize during the new
president’s reign.

The University of Pittsburgh administration tends to
operate in a top—down fashion so that many people in the
lower echelon have not had input in administrative
decisions before they are made. An example of this would
be the hiring freeze instituted by Posvar last February.

The day Posvar made the announcement, professors
from across the country were already on their way to Pitt
to be interviewed and also to view the campus and its
working conditions. Unfortunately, the department chairs
were not informed of Posvar’s decision, and therefore,
could not tell these people not to come.

Many people are against faculty unionization because
of the current strike situation at Temple University. But it
was a lack of interest in union demands by the university
that really caused the strike.

‘K The time is now for unionization at Pitt.

Current events...

If anybody cares, here are some
of my views on current events.

0 Here’s a scary thought for Pitt
students: The Pitt faculty now
has the opportunity to unionize.
The Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board, in its inﬁnite wisdom, has
granted Pitt faculty members the
right to vote on whether or not
they want to be in a union.
Previously, they were barred from
doing so because they were
considered managers by the
PLRB.

You know, Temple University
had the chance to unionize. Look
where it’s at now. The faculty
members on strike; the students
are home until the beginning of
next term, and the university
ultimately loses huge amounts of
money. Almost all of the state
colleges in Pennsylvania very
nearly went on strike, which
would have put thousands of
students out of school.

Now Pitt is getting that same
chance. I’m sorry, but I’m
spending money at this university
to get an education in English
writing, not in labor relations. I
don’t feel like sitting around while
unions prod businesses (which
Pitt really is) for more money.
Although unions may have their
place in other areas, they have no
place in higher education.

-It’s a good thing that the
presidential—search committee
only had one open hearing. If it
had any more, the university
might not have a new president
until, say, the turn of the century.

Now, before anybody starts
getting into a tizzy, let me say that
I fully endorse what the Black
Action Society did at the last
meeting. BAS members raised
the question of their own
concerns and demanded that they
be heard. Yes, it would be nice if
students could have more
representation. But if the
committee has to stop now to
include more people in the
process, then there is no possible

 

Jeff
Tatusko

way that it will meet its deadline
for choosing the next president,
and that's just going to mean
hard times for the university.

-Is it me, or is everybody sick
of hearing about budget deficits?

Now Pitt is joining the parade
of organizations with budget
problems. President Wesley
Posvar has determined that Pitt
will be $14.5 million in the red for
the next ﬁscal year. Many people
have brought many possible
sources for extra funds to cover
this debt, like department budgets
and the endowment fund.

Hmm, I wonder where tl1ey’re
really going to get the money to
cover this. OK, everybody now,
so that you’re not surprised later:
HIGHER TUITION.

-Surprise, surprise — there's
another scandal in the athletic
department. This time it's costing
the Golden Panthers $100,000.
Between forged checks and
missing funds, the Golden
Panthers have lost that much
money and, naturally, demanded
somebody’s job. They got this
with the resignation of the
assistant athletic director of
development, Robert Heddleston,
who was caught forging the
checks.

Now, most people who forge
checks go to jail. But athletic
director Ed Bozik allowed him to

bow out gracefully. “Bozik j let

negligence on his part. I don’t

she failed to receive the necessary
214 votes in the British House of
Commons. Though she missed
that number by only four votes,
it was enough. Thatcher was one

Europe for American foreign
policy. She stood by both
Presidents Reagan and Bush
when most of the world
condemned them.

Now she is gone, and it will be

region. But 450,000 American

Grapplers look to improve upon last ys dsap

By Christopher Block
stay‘ Writer

As the Pitt wrestling team
prepares itself for the beginning
of its 1990-91 campaign, the
outlook appears to be excellent
for the squad to improve on last
year’s record. Head coach Rande
Stottlemyer will look to combine
the experience of 12 returning
lettermen and the recent addition
of three strong freshmen to boost
his team past last season’s
disappointing 5-12 dual-
tournament record.

This season marks the second
phase in a rebuilding plan that
began last year and should end
next year. Stottlemyer, in his 12th
season as head coach at Pitt, is
excited about this year’s
campaign. “Last year we took a
step back; we were rebuilding.
This year, we will be more
competitive, but we still have
learning to do,” he said.

The grapplers will rely on the
consistent performances of
seniors Joe Hilferty and Brian
O’Korn to provide leadership and
direction. Both ﬁnished ﬁfth last
year in the Eastern Wrestling
Tournament. Other veterans that
should contribute are 126 pound
junior Sean Moffltt, 158—pound
junior Scott Hovan and

UConn hits jackpot W

heavyweight Perry Miller. Hovan
is a’ two-time letterrnan and has
qualified for the national
tournament twice. Miller, who
also is a two—year letterman,
defeated All-American Erik Shultz
last year.

Another key factor will be the
team’s youth. Among the
probable starters are three
freshmen and one sophomore.
At 118, freshman Mike Moore,
who placed third twice in the
PIAA State Tourney, should start.
Another freshman who looks like
he might break into the starting
lineup is Chad Pines. Wrestling at
150, Pines also placed among the
top three in the PIAA Tourney.
The third freshman to enter the
starting lineup is 190-pound Jeff
Kloiber. Kloiber was a runner—up
in the PIAA.

Rounding out the starters are
juniorJoe Bursick and sophomore
Steve Budman. Budman ﬁnished
sixth last year in the Eastern
Wrestling League and was an
impressive 20-13 as a freshman.

Other wrestlers that will
compete for starting positions are
sophomores Mike Michalic, Jim
Monteleone and Sean Gibbs.
Michalic is a transfer from North
Carolina and wrestles at 134
pounds. Monteleone will wrestle

ith four top 100 hoop recruits

By Derek Willis
Sta_[)" Writer

The season of Thanksgiving is past us, but many
college basketball coaches are still celebrating their
good fortune during this month, as many of the top
high school players in the nation decided on their
college choices.

Two weeks ago, prep players were allowed to
sign national letters of intent with their chosen
schools, and there were several schools who already
have signed impressive recruiting classes.
Connecticut, reaping the benefits of its Big East
championship last year, signed four players rated
among the top 100 in the nation, all from outside
the state.

Kansas did the Huskies one better by bringing in
an entire starting five, featuring S—foot-7 Calvin
Rayford and 6-9 Ben Davis. Davis had narrowed his
choices to the Jayhawks and Pitt.

Speaking of the Panthers, they signed three top-
100 players: 6-0 point guard Jerry McCullough, 6-
6 forward Orlando Antigua and 6-7 forward Chris
Gant. But Pitt was hoping to ink Davis as the
replacement for Brian Shorter. Davis plays at Oak
Hill Academy, a virtual feeding ground for Paul
Evans the past few years.

Both UConn and Pitt are still in the running for

6-8 Donyell Marshall, who is rated as high as eighth
by some scouts, but Connecticut has already signed
a player at his position. Marshall is also being
courted by Syracuse as the successor to Billy
Owens.

The traditional powers of college hoops did well,
although Georgetown was one school which did
not fare well in the early period. Michigan nabbed
two of the top 12 players, while Syracuse inked four
of the top 125 players and is in the running for two
more top—10 prepsters. The rest of the Big East did
not do well, as only UConn, Pitt and the Orangemen
got top-100 players.

Local product Will Macon of Perry joined an
impressive group of recruits at DePaul, including
top-20 players Tom Kleinschmidt and Howard
Nathan.

Other big winners were Duke, which signed two
6-10 centers from California, and Virginia, has three
top players in the fold and is seeking No. 4. Georgia

early returns.

The second signing period comes in April, and
several top players are waiting until then to decide
on a school, including Chris Webber, considered
the top player by Basketball Weekly, Marshall and

Penguins played hockey like turkeys over Thanksgiving holiday

\X/hile everyone was home for
the holiday, enjoying family and
friends, I suffered in the ‘Burgh
and watched the Penguins play
like a bunch of turkeys.

On Friday night the Pens
traveled to the Cap Center to take
on Washington, a team they have
owned in Landover for the past
five years. But Friday night was a

came out hot against Philly and
led 2-1 at the end of one period,
but then the Pens got sloppy and
paid for it; losing 5-4.

This loss raised some interesting
points: The Pens have an awful
tendency to try to showboat at
home in front of the big crowd.
The Flyers’ goaltending shut the
Pens down time and time again,
while the offense converted five
times against Tom Barasso, who
struggled in the pipes. This loss
was a big one because it told the
familiar tale of the “not ready for
prime time Penguins.”

long evening in Washington. The
Caps scored five times in the first
against Frank Pietrangelo,

including three goals in 21
seconds.
Wendell Young relieved

Pietrangelo, but it was too little
too late. The bombs had been
dropped, and a cloud of confusion
swept over a team that had gone
6-3-1 in its last 10 games before
Thanksgiving. Funny thing
though — the Pens should have
won this game. They smothered

than a minute into the overtime
period to give the Penguins a
desperately needed two points.

There is no way the Pens should
have won this game, however.

The Caps played a tremendous
defensive game, as well as I’ve
seen any team play all year. They
forechecked like mad, and for
about 40 minutes the Pens were
totally lost —— not even able to
make a pass out of their own

zone. Pietrangelo held the Caps
at bay while the Pens meandered
around the solid ice as if it were
melting. Then Capitals goaltender
Jim Hrivniak, who stoned the
Pens all weekend, went down
with a leg injury, and in came

nothing to be happy about; they
forgot many of the basic
fundamentals that made them
look so sharp on the road and
paid for it by picking up only two
out of six points against the
division.

It is rather ironic that the only
game they did win is the one in
which they got good goaltending
—— the proof that the most valuable
player on a team is the one with
the most equipment on. The
Penguins need to win a couple of
games in a row in order to climb
back into the hunt for the top
spot in the division, especially
the way the New York Rangers
are playing. But the Patrick
Division season is long and riddle-
filled, and the consistent shall
rise (unless you’re consistently
bad like Quebec and my new
fave Toronto).

This week the Panthers travel
to Las Vegas, Nev., where they
will compete in the Las Vegas
Invitational Tourney. Coach
Stottlemyer looks at this meet as
a good proving ground for this
year's squad, as it will be up
against the best competition in
the country.

“Las Vegas is the second—best
tournament in the country, next
to the NCAA championships at
the end of the season. The
competition there will be
extremely, extremely tough, but
we're excited about it and
definitely looking forward to it.”

For a team that has struggled

over the past year, this seems like .‘

a maverick approach to a
tournament that will obviously
test its skill, but heavyweight Perry
Miller has a good motto that has
stuck with the team: “If you want
to sail with big ships, you have to
get in deep water.”
