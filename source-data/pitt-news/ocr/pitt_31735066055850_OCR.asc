Drawing onher own experiences of
growing up in Alabama during the 1950s
and ‘60s, Mab Segrest challenged her
Friday audience with the questions and
concerns that surround homophobia.

Segrest was the guest speaker for the
lecture “Race, Class, Gender,
Homophobia: Sexuality is the Link,” spon-
sored by the Women’s Studies Program;
the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance;
and the Lesbian. and Gay Academic
Association at Pitt. p

Segrest, author of “My Mama’s Dead
Squirrel: Lesbian Essays on Southern
Culture,” and most recently “Memoirs of a
Race Traitor,” is coordinator of the U.S.
Urban-Rural Mission of the World Council

As she sat along the circle she had
formed with the 30 or so audience mem-

of being homosexual in a small Alabama

culture had not yet found the vocabulary to
address it.

Segrest said she learned to suck it all

Wecht speaks out about Gammage case

Coroner questions
police relations

By Nicole Wilson
Staff Writer

It seemed inevitable that the death
of Johnny Gammage would be the
fuel for debate of such topics as
racial hostility and police brutality.
Allegheny County Coroner Cyril
Wecht said that, more importantly, it
should be a provocation for changes
in police training.

Police are seldom subject to psy-
chological testing during their train-
ing and, according to Wecht, this is
detrimental.

“A lot of [police officers] have
problems going in,” Wecht ‘said. An

officer may be granted authority
despite these problems, either
because they go unrecognized or are
ignored. ‘

“The problem is that the authority
is in the‘ hands of somebody with a

"gun or billy club,” he said. Wecht

said he believes this was the case in
the death of Gammage.

Wecht conveyed his opinions and
clarified the technicalities of the
Gammage case Tuesday night at a
University Democrats meeting. ’

Wecht called the case one of “prob—
ability versus possibility.” In October
of 1995, Gammage was involved in a
low-speed car chase with police.
After being pulled over, a struggle
ensued which resulted in Gammage’s
death. The cause was compressional
asphyxiation according to Wecht,
who examined the body twice.

Wecht said he believes that police

were originally suspicious of
Gammage simply because he was a
young, black man. However. Wecht
noted that incidents of police vio-
lence are not limited to racial bias.

“There aren’t always black and
white issues," he said. “It’s more of a
police/citizen thing.”

The only way to lessen the occur‘-
rence of such -incidents is to monitor
officers-in-training more closely and
to necessitate higher standards for
positions of legal authority. Wecht
said.

“I don’t think the Gammage case is
going to change the situation dramat-
ically,” Wecht said, but he added that
he hopes it will result in a greater
awareness on the part of police.

Police accused in the Gammage
case have faced criminal action thus
far, and will face civil action some
time next year.

CMU, Pitt to read
Nazi victims‘ names

By Tracey Katz
For The Pitt News

History is essential to mankind so that we can remember
what civilization has wrought. Remembrance empowers us
to avoidrepeating the tragedies of the past.

The University of Pittsburgh’s Hillel foundation is spon-
soring the second annual reading of the names of those who
died in the Holocaust, with the help of student activists
from Carnegie Mellon University and Pitt. The reading will
begin at midnight tonight and continue for 24 hours.

This event, which coincides with Yom haShoah I

(Holocaust Remembrance Day), is being coordinated by
CMU students Daniella Topol, Michael Robertson, Jessica
Cobert and Pitt Hillel Program Director Max Gershenoff. It
is part of a community—wide effort to ensure the genocide,
like that committed by the hands of Hitler’s Third Reich, is
neither forgotten or repeated, according to the organizers.

The reading will take place in the middle of the CMU
campus at the painted fence, rain or shine. The event will
also be broadcast over the CMU campus station, WRTC,
live for five hours.

Already, 144 CMU and Pitt faculty and students are par-
ticipating as readers. Among them are CMU Dean of
Students Michael Murphy, CMU President Robert
Mehrabian and Pitt student Amy Silverman.

Each reader will take turns reading for 10 minutes. Those
people still interested in reading who have not signed up
yet are encouraged to volunteer.

Also, there will be a large-scale art installation designed
by Malchus Ganocko accompanying the reading. This has
already been set up, and it runs from CMU at Forbes

tragedy many of us will never be able to

Nordenberg said that sorrow at the loss of.
life in the bus crash reached"all over the
world, from the remaining students on
Semester at Sea, to the family and friends of
the two Indian nationals killed, to the stu-
dents and administrators throughout the
University of Pittsburgh. '

“This unexpected loss of life is a source of
great sorrow  to us all, and especially so in
the lives of the family and friends of those
who died,” Nordenberg said.

Director of the University Center for
International Studies Burkart Bolzner said
that he hoped those gathered at the ceremo-

Matt Finer and Christine Bertauski, each
former Semester at Sea students,,~ spoke at
the ceremony. Both of them related letters
and messages of current Semester at Sea stu-
dents to the family and friends of those who
died.

“‘Everything happens for a reason, they
say,”’ Finer said, reading a letter from
Amato’s roommate to Amato’s parents
which thanked them for allowing their
daughter to go on the voyage. “‘I’m proud to
have known Virginia no matter for how short
a time.”’

That was the overwhelming sentiment of
all the letters read at the ceremony. Many of
them thanked the parents of the deceased for

Holocaust

°From page 2
Avenue past Hunt Library.

Faces of various Holocaust
victims will be presented
along with a pertinent quote.
The goal here is to show that
each victim of Nazi Germany
had a face and a name.

The night will begin with a
short prayer, followed by the
beginning of the reading.
Around noon there will be a
poetry performance to break
up the event.

This performance was
written by CMU student
Leigh Silverman and will be
acted out by Tressa Pope,
Dagmara Domniczyk and
Jenna Kalinowsky, also from
CMU.

The event will end with a
memorial prayer lead by
Hillel Rabbi Art Donsky.

“We are doing this vigil to
remember the names and
faces  we remember by
doing, not just listening,”
Topol said. “This is a chance
for anyone and everyone to
participate and raise aware-
ness.”

Robertson encouraged
everyone to join CMU, Pitt
and the community.in saying
“never forget.”

“Remembering the
Holocaust is about the
tragedy and horror of what
happened and the proactive
stance we must take to pre-
vent such events from occur-
ring again,” he said.

Homophobia

°Frompage1
empathy she felt with the
first African Americans
integrated into her school.
She figured that at that
moment those students,
escorted in by 200 National
Guardsmen, must have
been feeling very powerful,
yet she sensed a loneliness
that connected them.

She said she has travelled
a long road to arrive at
where she is now in her
endeavors of advocacy and
teaching. Once she came
out, she began asking her-
self questions, the same
ones that she posed to the
people seated around her at
the lecture. She asked how
you go from questions of
sexuality to questions of
race. Her memories of the
integration and experiences
of -life in a region histori-
cally known for it racial
tensions urged her to find
the links. She began to see
the connections between
race, class, gender and
homophobia.

She pondered how to

~ bring these theoretical con-

cepts into the community to
start deconstructing barri-
ers. We might think of it in

0 politics of

terms of bodies. We all

have them and they are the .

prime means of individual-
izing and labeling.

What color are you? what
sex are you? What is your
sexuality? Where are you
situated on the economic
scale?

“It’s all about being in a
body, in a culture that hates
bodies,” she said.

When it comes to dealing
with homophobia in our
country, we might take a
cue from the language and
the South
Africans, she suggested.
They have a word that
means “born to belonging”
and have written the first
constitution to include the
protection of sexual orien-
tation.

“Maybe we’ve got a lot
more to learn from them
than they have to learn
from us,” she said.

In our fast-paced culture,-

plagued with ever-changing
ideas of what is an accept-
able political stance, people
sometimes cling to one
thing that offers them psy-
chic stability, she said.

tion that condemns homo-
sexuality as sin.

Segrest said these people
who justify their homopho-
bia on the basis of Biblical
text need to be asked what
parts of the Bible they have
chosen not to follow. Based
on each person’s own per-
sonal experiences, they
throw out some of the
dogma or create their own
interpretations. The ques-
tion becomes why these
parts are up for interpreta-
tion, but homosexuality as
a sin is considered to be an
indisputable fact.

Next wave discrimination?

We've heard of racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and
just about every other kind of discrimination you can imagine. But at
least two people are worried about what could be the next basis for
discrimination - faulty genes. Two Marines in Hawaii are now being
threatened with 60-day imprisomnent, loss of rank and pay, and bad
conduct discharges for refusing to provide blood DNA samples dur-
ing a physical.

The two marines refused because they didn't want their DNA sam-

ple to be catalogued in a Defense Department database. Corporal , V

Joseph Vlacovsky and Lance Corporal John Mayﬁeld felt the DNA
sampling was an invasion of their right to privacy. And their claim is
being backed by civil rights supporters. .

The Pentagon claims that the DNA samples are intended to allow
more accurate identiﬁcation of soldiers killed in the line of duty.
While that may be a very useful source of information and may make
identification easier, it may also lead to a person's DNA records
becoming public information.

Modern technology has given us the ability to identify and isolate
certain genes which make people more prone to illness or disease.
Some civil rights groups fear that this kind of information will lead to
discrimination based on a person's DNA makeup. If a person was
prone to get leukemia (or, for a more discriminatory example, was
genetically inclined to be homosexual) an employer might not hire
them. '

This may sound like a far—fetched idea. But if genetic databases are
universally created and accessible by anyone, there is deﬁnitely a
potential for abuse. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, some
researchers have already found cases of genetic discrimination (April
12). And even if you don't believe those reports, just remember that
Hitler claimed non—Aryan groups to be genetically inferior. That is an

extreme example, but what would happen if someone decided some- '

thing in your DNA made you more susceptible to hostile aggression
or anger? Would that be used against you in someway? Probably. _

Leave blame out of it

For one family, tragedy struck last Friday night, when a plane
ﬂown by 7-year-old Jessica Dubroff crashed, killing her, her father
and a ﬂight instructor. Much debate and innuendo has been thrown
around since the crash. Some argue that the crash was the parents‘
fault, others say it was no one‘s fault. But what difference does it
make whose fault it was? Three people are dead, and blame carmot
change that. ‘

  Qrte argu_m_ent"many seemto -agree with is -that 7-year-olds should-

r:1"t'b"e ﬂying planes. You have to_,be 16 to drive a car (in most states),
'2l "to own a-liandgun,‘but thereis no age restriction on ﬂying.

‘ Jessica's plane crashed during her attempt to be the youngest pilot
to ﬂy non-stop across the country. This is the second argument. There
can be no doubt that some parents push their children too hard, too
young. But whether or not that is the case in Jessica's family is ques-
tionable. Either way, blaming J essica's, parents for the crash serves no
purpose, since both she and her father are dead.

The most important thing to
remember when writing acol-
umn is relevance. If readers
don’t care about a particular
subject, I may as well not write
the piece.

With that creed foremost in
my mind, I carefully chose an
issue for this column, the thing
that was, by far, the most fasci-
nating news of the last few
weeks. Of course, I'm talking
about Britain's cattle problem.

It would have been good too
——I even had a headline picked
out: “Mad- Cows and
Englishmen.” But then I picked
up U.,The National College
Magazine that Makes More
Trash in the Halls Than Credit
Card Applications Inserted in
the Pitt News. The cover story
was about MTV. ’

The gist of the article was
that the channel was not play-
ing enough videos, apparently
causing some anger among
various people. “‘As a college
student, my time is very limit-
ed  I can't turn on MTV and
know that I'm definitely going

_ to see videos anymore. It’s dis-

9!?

appointing won the prize for
funniest quote. Stuff that good
shouldn't be passed over, and
since there was a chance that-
this interesting dilemma may
matter more than I think it
does, I decided to write about
that instead.

The problem was I didn’t
have anything to say about that
great, divisive and important
controversy, other than to say
that MTV plays too many
videos. Sure, “Singled Out”
may be a lousy show, but
Smashing Pumpkins is far
worse. But that opinion, I soon
discovered, wasn't enough to
fill a column. So I turned off
the computer, went into the
kitchen, and had a beer.

Beer! That's it! Everybody at
Pitt cares about beer, even
more than they care about Mad
Cow Disease, and certainly
more than they care about
MTV.

So I went into the living

on
enry

room, turned on the TV, and
tried to think of something

, interesting to say about beer. I

noticed the commercials, espe-
cially the ones for beer.

These ads should be banned,
and not because alcohol use
leads to medical problems,

ruins families and causes peo-

ple to drive their cars into.
poles. They should be banned.

because they’re stupid.

, It didn’t used to be that way.
Frankness was-a trademark of
old beer commercials — for
example, “Schaefer is the One
Beer To Have When You're
Having More Than One.”
Either that, or they were funny,
like the old “Tastes Great/Less
Filling” ads 15 years ago.

Nowadays, it’s horny frogs,
or ants listening to music that
was stupid 20 years ago. As if
they aren’t bad enough, how
about that bulldog who sounds
just like Tommy Lee Jones
when he talks, telling me to
“be my own dog”? This could
mean many things, most of
them insulting, but what I
guess the dog is telling me is
that I shouldn't be fettered by
an authoritarian society, that no
one can tell me what to do. The
pooch, by the way, has been
painted red. So much for the
dignity of being your own dog.

The ads starring humans are
even worse. Those Lite Beer
commercials featuring jerks
transforming sporting events
and karate movies into their
own idiot fantasies, for exam-
ple, are impossible not to
wince at.

Then there's the case of
Samuel Adams. It’s made by a
group calling itself the Boston
Brewing Company, and ads
claim that the beer is made in
small quantities using an old
recipe, and that enjoyment of
the beer bestows instant con-
noisseurship. Yet it is manufac-
tured on Liberty Avenue, in the

same building where American.

  Mad cow disease, MTV and beer

and Old German is pr‘oduced.

The company's ads are noth-
ing but a series of questions,
but they still manage to be
annoying: Do you love beer?
Do you love the taste of beer?
Do you know the difference
between a lager and a pilsner?
Do you know that the water
used in our beer is the same
Allegheny River crud that’s in
your toilet right now?

I invented that last question,
much like the Miller Brewing
Co. invented the Plank Road

Brewery so it could market.

Icehouse and Red Dog as if
they were made in small wood-
en buildings instead of in bil-
lion-gallon vats next to Miller
High Life.
Speaking of cheap beer, how
about Old Milwaukee's “It
, Doesn't Get Any Better Than
This” campaign? The message
here is that the combination of
beer and camping means relax-
ation with friends in an idyllic
setting. In real life, however, it
means that the motor oil and
spare tire that someone dug out
of their trunk is going to be
thrown into the fire, so that the
mud fight that has been going
on for the last eight hours can
continue in the well-lit, if not
toxic, site. ‘
With these and many other
examples, the brewing industry
has demonstrated that they
can't prevent themselves from
producing 30 seconds of bore-
dom, dishonesty and stupidity
whenever they make a com-
mercial. A ban, of course,
would be censorship, and since
nobody wants that, I’ll back off
from my original position with
a compromise: beer ads are
still barmed, but they can return
when they get better. In the
meantime, liquor and wine
companies, who have been
censored for years, can take
their place. That way,

Thunderbird could advertise. -

Now there's a commercial I’d
like to see.

here wasn’t much to

say after last year’s

football season in
which the Panthers started
out 2-0 and managed to drop
the finalnine games of the
year and record the worst
mark since Head Coach
Johnny Majors’ return to Pitt
in 1993. There certainly
weren’t many good things to
say. ’

The Panthers had problems
at many areas on the field
and off. Pitt finished the 1995
campaign — seven in the

turnover category, including ‘ ,

a Big East-high 24 intercep-
tions. Late in the season,

‘Majors voiced his complaints
iibout the ‘lackluster wide- ‘

receiving corps, and it wasn’t
long after his last game as a
Panther that'Dietrich J ells
went public with his criticism
of the Panther staff, especial-
ly Majors. With all that in the
past, the Panthers still have
one problem to worry about,
one which destroyed the
squad last year. Injuries.

I.yfIe Ieucls offense over defense

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

The Pitt offense bested the
Pitt defense 27-22 in the new-
format, game-situation Blue
and Gold scrimmage played
Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

Three touchdown drives
from Matt Lytle and a 91-
yard kickoff return by Curtis
Anderson provided the Blue
offensive scoring, while a
Denorse Mosely interception
return for a touchdown, two
offensive turnovers and nine
stopped drives earned the
Gold defense points under a
specially-designed scoring
system.

“I am pleased overall with
our work today,” said Head
Coach Johnny Majors. “It
was agood finish to an over-
all positive spring practice.”

The game marked the end

of the 15-practice spring

schedule, and helped to settle
some contested spots in the
Pitt lineup. 9 ‘

First and foremost, Lytle’s
performance on the afternoon
prompted coach Majors to
issue this postgame state-
ment: “Matt Lytle is leading
the way at quarterback, and I
anticipate it to finish that
way.”

' While the left-handed, red-
shirt sophomore did not toss
any touchdowns on the after-
noon, he was at the helm for
all the offensive scoring,
including a 16-play drive
which ended with a Billy

.Community

West three-yard touchdown
run. The drive was West’s
only significant action of the
afternoon.

“I’m real happy Billy’s
healthy,” said Lytle. “I think
that’s going to be the key
right now.” '

Lytle described how the 1

running game sets up the pass
in Pitt’s current system,
which explains how Lytle
could nail down a starting job
with three completions on six
attempts for the entire scrim-
mage. Lytle’s reluctant back-
up, redshirt junior Pete
Gonzalez, threw four passes,
completing only one.

“I’ve been behind people
all my career,” said Gonzalez,
who played most of his min-
utes with the second unit. “I
feel I’ve performed. I feel
I’ve done what [the coaches]
have asked me to do. '

“Hopefully, some day I can
open some eyes.”

Opening some eyes in the
race for second-string run-
ning back was Dwayne
Schulters, a 5-foot-7 junior
transfer from Nassau
College.
Schulters scored on a one-
yard dive and cracked off
several big gains on the after-
noon, including an 11-yard
scamper on fourth and two
which set up his touchdown.
He finished the day with 100
yards on’ just - 12- carries, lead-
ing all rushers.

admitted that Pitt’s problem
with depth at running back
was a main factor in his deci-
sion to transfer. His play in
the scrimmage helped push
him ahead of sophomore
Demetrius Harris in the eyes

Schulters “a pleasant addition
to our team.”

Pitt’s other transfer, wide
receiver Jake Hoffart, made
his presence felt by scoring
on a 34-yard end-around play.

Pill runners dominate Panther Relays

Quarterbacks Matt Lytle and Pete Gonzalez share a. laugh

Sunday’s Panther'Relays were supposed to provide a
chance for Pitt’s track and field athletes to win races. Pitt
dominated on the scoreboard, but several of the races were
not the easy victories that were expected.

In one of the day’s more exciting races, Pitt pulled out a
win in the last leg of the women’s shuttle hurdle relay.
After Tonya Mullins, Jennifer Williams and Gennifer.
Washington finished the first three legs, Pitt was in second
place, a few steps behind the team from Eastern Michigan
University. Najuma Fletcher steadily gained ground for
Pitt and took the lead with about 20 meters left. Pitt won
the race by three tenths of a second with a time of 58.4

back Billy West was project-
ed to shoulder the bulk of the
Panther load, but in the sea- '
son opener against
Washington State, West suf-
fered a bizarre strain of liga-
ments in his chest and missed
the next three games. West
returned in Week Five
against Virginia Tech, what
could be remembered as the
closest thing to a M.A.S;H

unit for Pitt. seconds. The race turned out exactly the way Pitt planned
The Panthers had dominat- it.
ed Tech in the first half “We didn’t have our best four legs on one team.”

Fletcher said. “We wanted to try to get everyone to run
their fastest. If the race wasn’t that close. I don’t think I
would’ve run that fast.”

Not everyone was as sure as Fletcher about what hap-
pened in their races. The women’s 400-meter hurdles was
as close as any race of the day. Pitt’s Angie Martin spent
most of the race in second place. She was a few steps off
the. lead going over the last hurdle. but Martin’s fast and
furious finish made the race so close that she admitted she
wasn’t sure who won the race.

Apparently, the finish confused the officials too. as two
different sets of results were reported for the race. When
the dust settled, it turned out that Martin’s finishing kick
came up just three tenths of a second short. She came in
second place overall with a time of 59.7 seconds. The win-
ner was an unattached runner. so Martin was the top colle-
giate finisher. followed by teammates Ayne Allen and

before. In a matter of minutes
the Panthers lost four starting
players, including West with
a fractured fibula, cornerback
Denorse Mosley with a
thumb injury, Dietrich Jells
and freshman running back_
Demetrius Harris.

If this wrath of injuries
wasn’t enough for the
Panthers, their luck got worse
when quarterback Pete
Gonzalez went down against
Rutgers in only his second
start after replacing John
Ryan. As the Panthers strug-
gled through a disappointing
year, minds shifted to next
year and possible improve-
ments were discussed.

Non-Pitt athletes  
enjoy stay in Oakland

By Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

I hope you’re sitting down, because I’m about to say some-
thing that may shock some of you. Here it is:

Pitt doesn’t suck. And people from other schools believe that.

Yesterday, Pitt hosted theAPanther Relays. The nice weather
and laid-back atmosphere at the track meet probably made every-
one a little bit happier, but people from other schools were still
very impressed with Pitt.

First and foremost, Pitt’s track team, both men and women,
dominated much of the meet. That fact did not go unnoticed by
the opposing athletes. The competition was hardly world—class,
but other schools marveled at the way Pitt won race after race.
Nobody gawks at the teams that get noticed around here, but if
you look, you will find successful athletic teams at Pitt.

Even Pitt Stadium earned praise. At a time when there is a lot
of discussion about building a brand-new convocation center, it
seems ironic that visiting athletes like the oldest athletic facility
on our campus.

One runner from the University of Buffalo genuinely enjoyed
running in our stadium. She told a story about how teams actual-
ly walked out in the middle of a meet in Buffalo because the con-
ditions were so bad. Nobody was leaving Pitt Stadium early yes-
terday. Teams seemed to enjoy soaking up the sun on the astro-
turf. ‘ .

Beyond athletics, these people were impressed with Pitt’s
whole campus (and yes, they referred to it as a “campus.”)
Teams of distance runners took warmup runs on the streets of
Oakland just to see the sights.

After taking a sightseeing tour of Oakland, several runners
from Buffalo were practically ready to transfer to Pitt. This is the
same Oakland that we all complain about constantly.

Pitt is hardly perfect. For every successful team here, there is
one that is just as unsuccessful. If Pitt Stadium is really that
great, Trees Field is equally hideous. But if strangers can come
in here for one day and find positive things to say, maybe, just
once in a while, those of us who live here can stop and see what
they’re talking about.

ed scorecard, earned praise from Majors, who
said the unit “has made progress the last week
to 10 days” of practice. The Gold squad took
the early lead thanks to Rasshad Whitmill, who
broke up a Gonzalez pass to Schulters on third
down with a punishing shoulderblock on the

new running back.

West’s touchdown and Chris Ferencik’s
point-after, gave the offense a 7-1 lead, which
lasted until the last play of the first quarter.
Backup quarterback Leon Murray lofted a
sideline pass on second down, which Denorse
Mosely stepped in front of and took 52 yards
for a defensive score. Chris Burnett’s extra-
point gave the defense a 9-7 edge.

- On the play, Mosely was charged with a 15-
yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct after
high-stepping his way untouched into the end
zone. Ferencik boomed the ensuing kickoff to
the nine-yard line anyway, but Anderson still

a huge gap between themselves and the race
leader in the second lap of the race. Curry was
closing fast, but the finish line approached
faster, and he was nosed out by less than a sec-
ond.

A similar fate befell Matt Samuel in the
Steeplechase. Samuel placed third overall and
second among college athletes with a time of
9235.6, just four tenths of a second behind the
second place runner. g

In several races, the closest competition Pitt
faced was other Pitt athletes. In the women’s
100-meter hurdles, Pitt had three runners in the
top four spots. Trecia Smith tied for fourth in
15.07 seconds, Jennifer Williams was second
in 15.04, and Tonya Mullins won the race with
14.47.

Taking the hurdles off the track made no dif-
ference. Pitt took first and second in both the
men’s and women’s 100-meter dash. Williams
was second in the 100 with 12.62 seconds.
Shana Fadis won the race in 12.39, the fastest
time this season by a Pitt runner. For the men,
Jay Jones won the 100 in 10.55 seconds and
Anthony Dorsett was second with 10.81.

Gennifer Washington led the long jump com-

took it the distance, going 91 yards and giving
the Blue team‘ the lead for good.

Other standouts for the defense included red-
shirt junior linebacker Roderick Humphrey,
who led the team with seven tackles in the
scrimmage. Majors called Humphrey “one of
our better leaders,” and praised his work for

petition from the outset. Her first jump of 5.68
meters was the best of the day. Washington
was pleased with the jump at first, but became
disappointed after later, shorter jumps.

“I wanted 70 (5.70 meters). I thought that
first jump was a good start,” Washington said.
