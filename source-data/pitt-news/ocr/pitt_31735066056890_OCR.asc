Pitt gives

$12 million
in library "
expansion
ByPeteKapustynski

Asst. News Editor

Hillman Library will
expand by approximate-
ly 75,000 square feet in
the next three years.
This is one of the many
renovations to the Pitt
campus partly funded by
Governor Robert P.
Casey’s Operation Jump
Start.

“What we hope to cre-
ate is a unified com-
plex,” Interim Libraries
Director Paul
Kobulnicky said. “We
don’t want an addition
that is just another build-
ing sitting off in some
space connected by
some tunnel. We want a
complex that works

together with the build-‘

ings around Hillman
something that works
functionally but invites
people in.”

Architects have been
selected and contracts
will be written by the
state probably within the
next two months,
according to L. Thomas
Hussey, associate vice
chancellor of Facilities
Management. If it hap-
pens on schedule, the
design stage will begin"
around April 1. Hussey
said he estimates it will
take about a year to
design the addition.

“You have about six
months to bid it and get
a construction contract.
Then it will take a little
over two years to build

The "O" disputes Pitt's commitment to safety

By John Temple
and Frank Porco
The Pitt News

Tired of crowds that gather nightly on
the corner outside The Original Hot Dog
Shop, owner Sydney Simon is pushing
for anti-loitering laws and an increase in
Oakland police officers.

Simon charged Pitt administrators with
indifference toward the safety of their
students and the rest of the Oakland
community in advertisements he placed
in The Pitt News and The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette last week.

“There were just as many people there
four years ago as there is now, but Pitt
took away the police force and there is
no supervision on the streets,” said Terry
Simon, Sydney Simon’s daughter who
manages the shop.

  

Splash into shape. . .

“\We’ve put an enormous amount of
time into safety in the last year,” Pitt
Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor said last
week at Pitt’-s Board of Trustees meeting,
in response to Simon’s letter. “\X/e’ve
improved shuttle systems, bus systems
and, on April 1, we will be enhancing the
lighting around Hillman, the Cathedral
and Frick Fine Arts.”

Owner Simon, who employs three off-
duty city police officers as security
guards, criticized Pitt for decreasing its
police force. Pitt’s police force has lost 10
officers and 10 guards since 1989.

Simon said Pitt wields a great deal of
influence in the area and should help the
city beef up the Oakland police pres-
ence. But O’Connor said he does not
believe that Pitt is responsible for the
safety of the Forbes Avenue business dis-
trict.

Although Terry Simon said she is wor-
ried that crowdsare driving away busi-
ness, she is also concerned that safety is
decreasing in general.

“It’s about saving a community, not
The Original,” she said. “The Original can
go anywhere.”

Simon called on Pitt to throw its back-
ing behind anti-loitering ordinances pro-
posed by local public safety officials last
fall.

With the ordinances, police could
arrest a loitering suspect who is a known
drug offender, gang member or is wear-
ing a pager without a legitimate reason.
Suspects could face $300 in fines or 90
days in jail.

“If Pitt administrators put their heads
together, they have the power to push
this thing,” Terry Simon said.

QUASAR reinforces math education while ma/eing itfim

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

Math isn’t just a four letter word.

The University of Pittsburgh
Learning Research and Development
Center (LRDC)' is conducting a pro-
gram designed to work on ways of
reforming mathematics instruction -
in other words, finding ways to make
math interesting and relevant to stu-
dents.

QUASAR (Quantitative
Understanding: Amplifying Student
Achievement and Reasoning),
launched in the fall of 1989, is fund-
ed by a $10 million grant from The
Ford Foundation.

The project’s goal is to increase
students’ capabilities and confidences
in themselves as flexible math prob-
lem solvers, to increase student
achievement in mathematics and pre-
pare students for college prep math
courses in high school.

It is aimed at all American stu-
dents, but emphasizes improving the
level of participation of disadvan-
taged minority students in more
advanced mathematics.

“If we don’t have a fairly mathe-
matically literate population, then it's
unlikely that we are going to be able
to be competitive in a technological-
ly sophisticated world,” said Dr.
Edward Silver, director for QUASAR.

Silver said that a knowledge of
mathematics can also help people
understand everyday issues such as
the economy.

Currently, QUASAR is at work in
six geographically dispersed sites
that represent a diverse cultural and
ethnic studentvpopulation. These
sites are in California, Georgia,
Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin and each have a col-
laborative team working closely with
the teachers and administrators of
the school.

The separate teams communicate
with researchers located at “QUASAR
Central” in Pittsburgh, who in turn
offer financial support, technical

assistance and feedback.

At the individual school level,
QUASAR is working to end the cycle
of repetitive drill and practice of
basic computations that has colored
the “middle school math experience”
for so many years.

Silver said that the teachers at the
school are changing the way they
teach. They are becoming actively
involved in trying to get students to
think about mathematics, not merely
going through the motions.

“The biggest criticism of mathemat-
ics education has been that the form
of instruction is mostly one that has
rewarded memory and imitation

instead of acting as though
they don’t count,” Silver said.

QUASAR is targeting mid-
dle schools, grades 6 through
8, because middle school has
a long history of being a
“mathematics wasteland,” in
which the math curriculum
has no clear direction.

“You have to start some-
where, and the fact is that
middle school is not too

late, the kids are still very
interesting, alive and excit-
ing,” Silver said.

“They haven’t learned com-
pletely at that level that math
is supposed to be isolated

"The excitement about math-
ematics is more of a general
excitement about using your
mind to do interesting
things.”

“The state’s contribution to
the [Hillman expansion] pro-
ject is $7 million. The
University’s is $12 million,”
Hussey said.

Hussey said there is a possi-
bility that the Masonic Temple
(on Fifth Avenue across from
the Cathedral of Learning) will
also be added to Pitt’s library
system.

“[The Temple] has a gross
square footage of around
160,000 square feet,” he said.
“The university has made an
offer of $8.5 million to buy
that building.”

He said this was a prelimi-
nary offer and there must be
more discussion betwee.n both
sides before anything is final-
ized.

“lThe Temple] will be used
for library purposes, like spe-
cial collections," Hussey said.

Kobulnicky said in the short
term it is necessary for the
Hillman addition to be flexi-
ble, considering other activities
such as the renovation of the
interior of Hillman, and the
possible addition of the
Masonic Temple.

"\Ve also want to be flexible
because of the growing impor-
tance of electronics in what
we do, as opposed to print,“
Kobulnicky said.

He said the addition of
wiring and other items neces-
sary for possible additions of
electronic media will have to
be considered. 0

addition will acknowledge the
fact that we are becoming
more and more dependant on

Wednesday,‘ February 24, 1993

Stop complaining
Violent crime on campus is on the increase while the numbers of both
university and city police are on the decrease. Aggravated assault has

I increased steadily since 1988 and it reached a high of 20 last year.

Forcible rapes, less serious assaults and robberies have all risen as well.

The way things look now, it doesn’t seem we can expect any improve-
ments in the near future.

The concem about crime on campus has now spread to local business
owners, such as the owner of The Original Hot Dog Shop who, in a let-
ter to Chancellor O’Connor, questioned the university’s dedication to safe-
ty. Furtherrnore, recent attacks aimed at local convenience stores now
make it look like nobody is safe in the Oakland area.

Attacks aimed at the administration for failing to address the issue of
safety on campus, however, are unfair. “The powers that be” as Mr.
Simon, owner of The Original, so eloquently put it have done a lot to
maintain a high degree safety on Pitt’s campus. An elaborate shuttle sys-
tem has been designed that makes it unnecessary for students to walk
home alone late at night. An escort service is also in the works.

The nurnber-one security issue of the administration was the safety of
its students ——- and that is what it should have been. O’Connor and Safety
Director Wdliam Brennan simply do not have the resources available to
them to protect everyone all of the time. Local businesses are not the
jurisdiction of the university.

City Council President and mayoral candidate Jack Wagner said that, if _

elected, he would substantially increase the city police force. A move like
this could increase the city patrol in the Oakland area and help protect us
students when we are oﬁf campus. But as violent crime is not likely to
decline, Chancellor O’Connor must match that promise to ensure our
safety.

Pitt will never be able to completely solve the crime problem on cam-
pus. Crime is the result of deeper socioeconomic problems, which can
only be dealt with in the long term. There are, no doubt, many professors
working on research projects trying to understand the criminal mind, and
that is the most important priority. For now, the issue of safety and crime
on campus is one that the administration and students, local businesses
and the city of Pittsburgh must work on together to assure maximum

A Welcomed addition

The recent decision of Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor to hire Dr.
Nancy Washington as assistant to the chancellor on issues concerning
underrepresented minority groups will hopefully bring some much-need-
ed changes to Pitt.

As minority retention and equal representation in key administrative
positions become more important issues for the campus community, it
doesn’t look like O’Connor could have hired a more qualified person for
the job. Washington was most recently the assistant dean of Minority
Affairs for Pitt’s School of Medicine. She also has an extensive back-
ground in admissions, recruitment and financial aid.

Her focus will do doubt be on women’s and minority issues, although
all groups should be properly represented. Her appointment couldn’t
have come at a better time, as Pitt looks uneasily toward a cloudy future.
Minority graduation rates average approximately 36 percent, compared to
61 percent for their nonminority counterparts. Furthemrore, there is an
undenepresentation of minorities in graduation and professional pro-
grams at Pitt, which reduces the number of minorities available for pro-
fessorship. “[The underrepresentationl, especially on the doctoral level
here and across the nation, is of great concern,” O’Connor said. “It is from
this small pool we must draw respected faculty.”

Hiring Washington will not solve all of the problems facing underrepre-
sented groups, but it should help. She certainly will have her work cut
out for her, and all we can hope is that the administration will be more
than just cooperative. O’Connor made the first move by hiring her. Lets
hope that they both succeed.

More sex and less violence needed

A few years ago, I was enjoy-
ing a late-night showing of The
Shining on one of Pittsburglfs
UHF stations when something
took me by surprise. In the
scene in which Jack Torrance
(Jack Nicholson) confronts what-
ever secret horror is lurking
behind the door of Room 257 in
the haunted hotel, he encounters
a beautiful nude woman who
rises from the bathtub, crosses
the room to him and embraces
him. Suddenly, a strange mist
arises from the bathrooms not-
very—steamy air and encloses the
woman’s body from
collarbone to thigh.

The film editors in
charge of adapting a
feature film for televi-
sion are enthusiastic
believers in inexplicable
pelvic and abdominal
fog banks. But that
same television screen-
ing of The Shining

and, most recently, footage of
bullets actually striking people.
Sexuality, which is usually left
in the cltunsy hands of half-hour
sitcoms, is restricted to silly plays
on words and, at the most, bare
shoulders above sheets. And talk
shows that try to satisfy the pub-
lic’s most basic sexual interests,
but stilloto remain inside the
boundaries of broadcasting stan-

Brian
Smith

included all of the gore
and violence of the the-
atrical version.

For some years now,
television editors have
been willing to include
scenes of overwhelm-
ing and explicit horror,
even when the scene does not
serve an important dramatic pur-
pose as it does in The Shining.
But we have yet to approach the
same level of explicitness on
television in the area of sexuali-
ty. The inconsistency becomes
even more pronounced when
one realizes that such awful vio-
lence is (thankfully) not a part of
most people’s everyday lives,
while sexuality is something that
very "nearly everyone experi-
ences personally many times
during late adolescence and
adulthood. To concede a point
to the hippie movement, we as
individuals do make love far
more often than we make war.

But television still places far
greater stock in the act of war
than it places in the act of love.
Hour-long action shows feature
exploding cars, massive gunfire

)BJH?-¢- I’. If um:

dards, find that they must choose
topics that are much more con-
troversial in order to weather the
dilution of television. Thus, all
that remains of sexuality on TV
is a sort of frantic flirtation, both
literal and frgurative.iViolence is
up close and personal, but sexu-
ality is an illusion at most.
Perhaps worst of all, UHF sta-
tions in many cities have begun
to show horror films on Saturday
and Sunday afternoons, appar-
ently trying to compete with the
variety offered by cable stations.
Although these films are shown
in the middle of the day, they
are edited on the same standards
as The Shining was on that late
evening that I remember so well.

Usually the weekend horror

matinees are films of far lower
dramatic quality, such as The
Return of the Living Dead, which

has graced television screens on
many a Sunday afternoon.

These films are placed in time

slots that are appropriate for the
youngest children, especially
those who are touring their
remote controls looking for any-
thing other than live golf or
bowling coverage. In’fact,
because of the new pervasive-
ness of the remote control, it
becomes much more likely than
ever before that a child will
stumble onto such a show with-
out meaning to do so. TV pro-
grammers place these shows
fearlessly, even reckless-
ly, into afternoon time
slots, but out of fear of
public pressure, they
hide more sexually sug-
gestive movies in the
late-night hours. And
even in the cloister of
the wee hours of the
morning, these films feel
the influence of jack
Torrance’s lover’s myste-
rious mist.
It is important to realize
that television is
programmed in this
way because that is
the way we will tolerate
it. TV stations bury
sexual situations in the darkest
corners of their schedules,
and they airbrush all offending
body parts out of sight
because they know that their
viewing audiences would be
outraged by a visible nipple at
any hour.

So why is our tolerance for
violence so much higher than
our tolerance for sexuality? Why
are we so desperate to hide sex-
uality from our children in the
daytime and even from ourselves
at night’ Why are we willing to
distract them and ourselves with
violence just to keep from seeing
two people making love? It’s
much like looking at our own
sexuality through an obscuring
mist.

One wonders what Jack
Torrance was getting so excited
about.

K catchs Pi

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team
ended its season last night,
but someone forgotto tell
the Panthers they had to
wrestle.

Leaving their intensity and
emotion with the Penn State
match the weekend before,
the Feb. 23 date with a little
Ohio school named Kent was
definitely not on their minds.

“A lot of people, after the
Penn State match, thought
the season was over,” Jeff
Kloiber said.

“We took the match too
lightly,” Sean Gibbs said. “No
one knows who Kent is.”

After the 23-13 drubbing
Pitt received by the Golden
Flashes, Pitt knew its oppo-
nent too well.

Losing its first three match-
es, the Panthers (9-4-1 overall
and 4-2 in the EWL) dug
themselves an early hole 10-
0. At 118, sophomore Mike
Moore lost a tough 5-3 deci-
sion to Kent’s Tom Manning.
Moore could manage only
three escapes in this nip—and-
tuck match.

Replacing John Richey at
126, Pitt sophomore Louis
Leeds was outclassed by his

opposition, Gary Define.
Define used two takedowns
and two near falls to rack up
an impressive major decision,
13-2, and give the Flash a 7-0
lead.

Expecting super sophomore
J.J. Fasnucht (31-14) to bring

the Panthers first win of the
match should not have been
anticipated. Despite his out-
standing season, he could not
shake the listless blues that
plagued Fasnucht and the
Panthers. Two Kyle Bentley

MCS/acme swims to Big East, stoc/e exchange

By Matt Silver-man
Sta_ﬂ' Writer '

On the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange, men and women
swim among swirls of paper, coin-
puter monitors and bidders’
screams, wheeling and dealing,
trying to buy and sell shares of
stock and racing against the clock
before the market closes -— a bro-
ker’s dream.

In the pool at Trees Hall, men
and women race to touch the wall
first among screams of teammates,
coaches and fans. Outside the
pool, there is the inevitable interac-

tion with those saine people, a
wheeling and dealing of personali-‘
ties — a team captain’s responsi-
bility.

For Clare McShane, the senior
co—captain of the Pitt women’s
swim team, these two worlds are
not too far apart as as she enters
this week’s Big East
Championships for her final colle-
giate challenge before she enters
the business world as an invest-
ment banker.

“With investment banking, you
have to be good at dealing with all
sorts of people,” McShane said. “In
swimming, especially as captain,

you are alsoamong a lot of differ-
ent people and you have to leam
how to interact and to read them,
just like you would in the business
worid.”

The senior from Morristown,
N.J., has learned how to deal with
people and success. In her previ-
ous three years, McShane has
qualified for the finals in nine of
the nine events she has participat-
ed in at the Big East
Championships. She saved her
best performances, after some dili-
gent practices and hard work, for
her final season.

V See McShane, page 10

Spring in February—-it must be baseball

It may be February, but
spring training begins in a
few weeks. Yes, it’s time to
start thinking about baseball.
0 The Pirates, thrice cham-
pions of the NL East, are as
big a question mark as they
have been in three years.
The hopes of the team lie
with its youth: Al Martin
(who has big shoes to fill),
Kevin Young, Carlos Garcia
and phenom Tim Wakefield.
Leyland has to once again
work his magic on these
Pirates, who might have the
fourth or fifth best talent in
the division. If Leyland man-
ages the Pirates to a fourth
title, he deserves the title of
demi—god.

0 On a sad note, this will
be my first year in
Pittsburgh without Barry
-Bonds. He received much

bizarre critcism while he
played here, but know this:
Bonds is the best player in
baseball, and not just
because he is supremely tal-
ented. He is a great outfield-
er and works hard on

Hillman

defense. He is a smart hitter
and knows the strike zone
better than most. Pittsburgh
didn’t always give him the
credit he deserved.

0 Watch out for the
Phillies. Not many people
will back me up on this, but
I like the way the Phils have
recreated their pitching staff.

Curt Schilling showed

'-rpocvu

great potential last year and
could win 18 games this
year. Terry Mulholland,
Tommy Greene and Danny
Jackson are all solid pitch-
ers, with Mulholland and
Jackson as the veterans. Jose
Dejesus was, injured last
year but could have a major
impact when healthy.

Out in the field there are
John Kruk, Darren Daulton,
Dave Hollins and Lenny
Dykstra (when he’s healthy),
who are all great players.
And the rest of the team
ain’t bad either. They might
not beat out the Expos for
the title, but they'll make a
race of it.

effect: Jose will shoot into

The intensity woes caught
up to Pitt again, or maybe it
was the Kent brother tandem
at 158 and 167, which used
some sort of sibling power to
tie up Panthers Joe Plouse

PROVIDENCE -
Nothing has changed.
Mired in a swamp of

inconsistent and lack-
adaisical play, the
Panthers continued to

sink further and further
away fr()m a once-certain
NCAA tournament birth

another critical Big East

this Pitt’s
dramatic
return to
the Big East win column:
a wake-up call of two
consecutive Fitzgerald
Field House losses, a
chance to impress a
national ESPN audience
against a relatively weak
opponent and the fact
that this was a proverbial
“must-win” game.

But instead of using the
opportunity to pick them-
selves up and dust them-
selves off, the Panthers

their way to a third con-
secutive conference loss,
their sixth in eight tries.

“My mother told me ‘If
you can’t say anything
nice, don’t say anything at
all,”’ Pitt head coach Paul
Evans said. “I have noth-
ing to say.”

No phase of the Panther
game-plan clicked.
According to Evans, the
Panthers “set the game [of
basketball] back 50 years”
as they hit only 19 of 63
shots from the floor, five
of 14 from the foul line
and an incredibly futile
five of 24 from beyond
the three-point stripe.

The Panthers could not
manage to jump start their

usually the mainstay of a
successful scheme.

finally put together a team
that looks like a contender
before the season starts.
Three or four years of
grooming a ton of young
pitching talent may finally
pay off big this year.

Mike Mussina has already
arrived, Ben McDonald
struggled but still has out-
standing potential, Rick
Sutcliffe is back, and a few
young pitchers are going to
try to get in the rotation.
The addition of Harold
Reynolds gives the Orioles
scoring punch from second,
a position that was barren
for them last year. And the
lineup is powerful, with
Ripken now only the fourth
most dangerous hitter on the
squad, instead of the sole
threat. Look for them to
challenge the Blue Jays all
year.

isn’t it funny how the domi-
nance of the West seems to
have fallen apart? The Blue
Jays, Orioles, Brewers and
Indians are good enough to
hang with the best of the
West this year, and the
Yankees are improving
steadily, while the Twins
and As took heavy off—sea—
son losses. The East may
even have the upper hand
this year.

have to beat us on
perimeter [to win].” ,

After seeing Pitt’s 50.2 per-
cent average from the floor,
it is obvious that Pitt was not
able to do that.

Panther power forward
Chris McNeal was once again
nonexistent, picking up only
two points on one-of—five
shooting. He played with a
complete lack of intensity
and leadership, placing him-
self in foul trouble early in
the game with a frustration-
driven foul after a missed
opportunity on the offensive
end.

A poor offensive game-
plan was worsened by a lack
of any type of fundamental
game. The Panthers turned
the ball over 13 times, were
victimized by seven steals
and committed 24 fouls —
hardly credentials for a Top-
25 team.

Pitt point guard Jerry
McCullough’s game contin-
ued to slide as he scored
only 12 points on four—of—1-4
shooting from the floor. Not
only did he lead the team in
points, but he was the only
Panther in double figures.

Defensively, McCullough

Abdullah. holding the two to
12 combined points.

But Providence's low score
of 35 was as much a product
of the its own shooting woes
as Pitt's defensive pressure
was. The Friars themselves
shot only 36 percent from
the floor, barely besting the
Panthers‘ inordinately low
percentage..

The only thing the
Panthers took home with
them back to Pittsburgh.
besides a sour taste in their
mouths and a renewed sense
of disappointment, was a
burning question that must
be answered, which
Providence forward Michael
Smith put into words.

Smith blasted McCullough,
knocking him down as he
drove the lane. As the.
Panther point guard lay on
the floor Smith towered over
him with his hands in the air
and a look on his face say-
ing “What are you going to
do now?”

Pitt’s tournament chances
hinge on the answer.

GAME NOTES: The
Panthers’ output of 48 points
is easily the lowest of the
season and the worst in
eight years. Pitt has not
scored fewer than 50 points
since 1985, when it lost to

the

only 10 of their 25 chances.
That’s what makes Evans’
scheme of inserting Brock
Generalovich into the lineup
and instructing his players to

shoot from three-point range
so interesting. Down by four
points with 1:06 left on the
clock, why not continue to
go for easy baskets while
sending the Friars to the line

away with at least a split of
the two shots? How pathetic
was the game? With a little

“\Vliat’s nice about this year is
the fact that not only is she a cap-
tain doing a great job of leading,
but from a pure swimming stand
point, shes further ahead right
now than she has ever been rela-
tive to this time in the season," Pitt

Coach David Belowich said.
Belowich added that an athlete
with McShane’s natural ability
could take her talent for granted.
“Clare has taken a step this year
to really focus and has come to
practice every day with the idea
that she is going to try to make

herself a better
Belowich said.

As a team captain on a young
team, Mcshane has given the
Panthers a unique combination of
a leading role model and a liaison
between coach and team.

“As a team co—captain she has

been a real good role model,” first-
year swimmer Susan Poorbaugh
said. “She’s a hard worker, and I
think she is inspirational for every-
body."

junior Jennifer Burns cites
McShane’s personality, besides her
work ethic, as another key to her

inspirational leadership.

“She is incredible the way she
can just get the team to pull
together,” Bums said. “We have
had a lot of rough times this year
and a lot of bad luck in our meets
and she was always there to smile
and look on the bright side of
everything."

McShane’s personality cuts
through people and touches their
hearts almost as fast as she cuts
through the water to touch the
wall.

“There have been times where
I've yelled at the term and other
times when I’ve praised them,”
McShane said. "You have to be
careful because they are your
friends and you don't want to step
on friends’ toes.”

But from the way her team-
mates and coach talk about her,
you would think she has been
tickling their toes.

“She brings a lot of humor, and
I’d say she has got to be one of
the funniest people on the team,”
Pooibaugh said. “She can break
the tension by making US all laugh.

“She is a rail person. Her per-
sonality lends itself to g(x)d leader-
ship all the way around,”
Belowich said ’I‘liat’s the kind of
swimmers I want —— good people
that happen to be good swim-
mers, and Clare is one of them.”

In the business world, where
dedication to the task at hand dri-
ves the individual to success,
Mcﬁhane should fit in nicely as she
has shown dedication throughout
her swimming career.

Originally joining a swim club
back in New jersey when she was
10 yczirs old, Mcshane was dedi-
cated to a boy she had a Crush on
who also joined the club. By her
first year of high school, she had
aliuidy set her sights on a college
scholarship. Now, with one meet
left, she is dedicated to the Big
Fast Championships.

“I‘m pretty optimistic about
doing well. I’ve had a strong sea-
son throughout and now I’m set-
ting myself up for some good
swims,“ McShane said, adding that
it was around Cliiistmastime when
she reali/ed she had to tum up the
intensity and rcnlly focus.

McShane has been to the Big
Fasts three times, and as a captain,
has tried to prepare the younger
swimmers for what to expect. But
the others already have some
expectations.

“I have been looking forward to
the Big  because I think Clare
is going to have the best meet of
her life,” Pooibaugh said

“Since this is her last meet at Pitt,
I know she’ll want to go out with
a bang.”

Her coach also  a successful
culmination to a fine career.

“She is really focused. You want
your seniors to finish their careers
on a very positive note, and I
think that Clare has done that and
then sortie," Belowich said. “We
are anticipating even more things
to come in the Big Fast meets lthis
weekendl."

McShane, a liberal studies major
whose business career will see her
kicking up the corporate ladder, is
defmitely dedicated to the task at
hand this weekend.

‘ “I’m just looking to kicking
some ass at the Big Easts,”
McShane_ said.

match. At that point Gibbs chose to
let Andrassy escape, for one point,
and go for the two-point takedown
and the win.

“You live and die by the take-
down,” Gibbs said of his gamble. “it
seemed to me he was more tired
than I was. I had to get a takedown
anyway if we went into overtime.”

Gibbs’ choice did not pay off, and
the senior lost a tight 10-7 decision
to Andrassy.

At 177, Pitt took a turn for the

THE PITT NEWS

worse. Sophomore Derek iiurgert
got caught on a takedown move and
was pinned with 32 seconds remain-
ing in the first period.

That loss erased all hopes of a Pitt
victory. Down 25-7, wins by Jeff
Kloiber at 190 and Pat Wiltanger at
heavyweight did not matter, they
only made the match appear closer
than it was.

“it was my responsibility to make
sure the team was ready," Pitt head
coach Rande Stottlemyei‘ said. “And
we weren’t ready.

LASSIFIEDS

“But we got to put it behind us
and not even think about it. We
have a week and a half to get ready
for the F.WLs (Eastern Wrestling
League Championships at Lock
Haven, March 6 and 7)."

Forgetting the bad experience of
the Kent match is what the Pitt
wrestlers will try to do in
their preparation for the league tour-
nament coming up, a therapy of
sorts.

“We have to screw our heads on
right for the F.WLs," Kloiber said.
