halts Voter
ID law

M CT Campus

WASHINGTON — Pennsylvania’s

strict new photo ID requirement,
which critics said could prevent
tens of thousands of eligible voters
from casting ballots, will not be
enforced in the November election.

A state judge blocked the new
rule Tuesday after deciding state
officials had failed to take steps
to make sure all registered voters
would be able to get the identiﬁca-
tion card they would need.

“In the remaining ﬁve weeks
before the general.election, the
gap between the photo IDs issued
and the estimated need will not
be closed,” Judge Robert Simpson
said. p ’

At least 90,000, and as many
758,000, of Pennsylvania’s voters
did not have a current driver’s li-
cense, a U.S. passport or a military
ID card that would allow them to
cast a ballot, according to court
testimony. Not just any photo ID
will work under Pennsylvania’s law.
It has to be a current government-
issued photo card with an expira-
tion date. C V

The decision is the latest —- and
perhaps most signiﬁcant — in a
series of court rulings that have
stopped Republican—sponsored.
laws that tightened the require-
ments for voting.

Last week, the Wisconsin Su-
preme Court said it would not move
to revive that state’s new photo ID
law, a‘ measure championed by Re-
publicans and opposed by Demo-
crats and civil rights advocates.

ELECTION 2012

Polling location moved to William Pitt Union

Megan Trimble
Staff Writer

Students will have a new place
to vote come November, as the
polling location in Posvar Hall has
moved to the William Pitt Union.

Robert Beecher, the Student
Government Board Governmental
Relations Committee chairman,
said that several background
issues motivated the Board to
pursue a change in the polling

location. The previous polling.

location for students residing in
the eighth district of the fourth
ward -—‘,which includes the Li-
tchﬁeld Towers and the Schenley
Quadrangle —— was Posvar Hall,
under the official polling location

titles of the Forbes Quad Lobby
and the Forbes Quad Study Area.
To pursue an official change

in location from the Allegheny.

County Division of Elections,
Beecher said SGB had to prove a
need and express a reason for the
change and University officials
had to agree with the change.

SGB sent a letter in mid-April '

with statistics and an allegorical

history that included informa-

tion on past conflicts —- including
the 2010 voting disputes, which
involved lawyers and concerned
student confusion with the sepa-
rate Posvar voting locations -
once the University ofﬁcials ex-
pressed interest inlmoving the
polling location.

The county response included
a site visit by the county Board of
Elections, and SGB and the Uni-
versity waited .for conﬁrmation
to move forward with the change.

The Division of Elections in-
formed Kenyon Bonner, direc-
tor of Student Life and associate
dean of students, of the official
polling location change on Sept.

28, and Bonner informed the SGB .

members. A

Board memberjulie Hallinan
said that while the ﬁnal deci-
sion was made by the _Division of
Elections, campus collaboration
included various administrators
and members of the Board.

“The process involved so many
people, so there was a lot of mak-

ing sure everyone was aware and
on the same page before the ﬁnal
decision could be made and ap-
proved,” Hallinan said.

Board member Halim Genus,
who was also involved in the plan-
ning to change the polling loca-
tion, did not respond to a request
for comment.

Hallinansaid that while stu-
dents will receive an official
announcement of the location
change from the Division of Elec-
tions, SGB will continue to spread
the information around campus,
and that they believe the Union
will provide an ideal location for
student voting.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGB, committees encourage community outreach

If one Student Government Board mem-
ber has his way, Pitt football games will get
livelier.

“I have a gift suggestion, and I know it’s
something that I’ve been harping on, but I

want a live panther for the football games,” ’

Board member Alex Murdoch said. “People
would go nuts. If anyone is interested in this
and wants to help out, _let me know.” .
This proposal came at Tuesday night’s
SGB public meeting in Nordy’s place, where
Board President James Landreneau an-
nounced that the Board has been discussing
bringing a gift to campus. He said to about
50 people in the audience that the Board
— responsible for distributing funds from
the more than $2 million Student Activities
Fund —— will be looking for gift suggestions
and student support if the initiative is to
move forward. Previous gifts from the Board
include “The Tree of Knowledge” sculpture

SGB also discussed campus safety and
student awareness at the meeting, start-
ing with Board member Megan McGrath,
who gave a shout out to the Pitt and City of
Pittsburgh police departments.

“I had a really scary incident in my house
over the weekend, but the police were su-
per nice and made me and my roommates
feel extremely safe,” she said. “I know we
were thankful for them last spring during
the bomb threats, but it’s also really nice
to know that they are around for us day-
to—day.”

Board member Natalie Rothenberger
reported that she rode the 30C with Trans-

portation and Safety Committee Chairman I ,

Richard White on Monday night to gain a
better understanding of the routes. Encour-
aging students to use the 30C as well as Safe
Rider when necessary, Rothenberger said
she is continuing to discuss safety through-
out South Oakland and is working on im-
proving the current situation. '

 

Community Outreach Chairwoman
Mary Mallampalli stressed the importance
of student involvement in the community.
She said that while Pitt Make A Difference
Day -— which will take place on Oct. 20 and
involve students helping clean Pittsburgh
communities — registration is currently
closed, students can still participate in cam-
pus community service.

One such event Mallampalli talked about
was the Sleep-in For The Homeless event on
Oct. 19, which includes a walkthrough of
Downtown and provides valuable informa-
tion on how to combat homelessness. The
event will provide students with ﬁve to six
community service hours. ..

Board member McGrath also provided
an update on the Pittsburgh area shopping
shuttle system initiative that she ran on in
the previous election. McGrath said that

- while she is having difficulty with the pro-

gram, which would include a shuttle system
to provide student access to shopping areas
in the Pittsburgh area, she is working to

VOTER ID

State trial judges had halted that law as well.

Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a Re-
publican who signed the new law in March,
conceded it will not go into effect this year.

“We’ll continue our efforts for the next
election and all future elections, to make
sure every registered voter has the proper
identiﬁcation in an effort to preserve the
integrity of our voting process in Pennsyl-
vania,” he said.

Four states have had strict photo ID laws
in place: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas and Ten-
nessee. Five others, including Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin, had similar laws due to take
effect this year, but all have now been halted.

“We are very glad voters will not be turned
away from the polls this November if they do
not have an ID,” said Judith Browne Dianis,
co—director of the Advancement Project,
one of several groups that sued to stop the
Pennsylvania law. “The evidence made it

clear to the judge that -this would indeed‘

disenfranchise voters.”.
With little fanfare, states such as Virginia
and New Hampshire put new voter identiﬁ-

cation laws into effect this year — and after‘

winning approval from the Obama adminis-

tration’s Justice Department. The difference
was that those states, unlike Pennsylvania,
allow voters to submit one of many forms of
identiﬁcation. Florida and Ohio, two closely
contested states, have such laws.

By contrast, Pennsylvania adopted a
much narrower ID requirement and sought to
implement the measure in just a few months.
And rather than open centers to help vot-

- ers obtain government photo IDs, it told _

the many elderly, disabled and low-income
citizens who do not drive that they must
travel to a state motor vehicles ofﬁce. They
were also told to bring a birth certiﬁcate, a
Social Security card and two other forms of
identiﬁcation.

State ofﬁcials recently announced new
steps to make it easier for voters to get the
proper ID, but they came too late to satisfy
the courts.

Two weeks ago, the Pennsylvania Su-
preme Court said it would accept “no voter
disenfranchisement” under the new law.
And citing that standard Tuesday, the judge
said the photo ID requirement cannot take
effect this year.

Pennsylvania had once been seen as a

battleground for President Barack Obama ,

and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney,
but recent polls have shown the president
with a substantial lead. I

“The Union has a nice in—and-out ﬂow
to it, and you don’t have to exit every room
the same way you enter, so it clears up a lot
of the traffic,” she said. “Because it’s not an
academic building, the Union won’t have
class traffic, which will hopefully make the
process less confusing, and there will be
fewer stories of students getting confused
or getting in the wrong lines.”

Beecher expressed his optimism about

the change.
“While this election period is more
of a trial run, and it will always be at the

county’s discretion for where polling in
the future will be held, we are anticipating
success,” Beecher said. “We are anticipat-
ing an increase in awareness of voting on
campus, an increase in student voting,
less disruption to student schedules and a
stronger opportunity for student involve-
ment in the civic process.”

During the election day, other opera-
tions in the Union will run as normal, and
Hallinan believes that the WPU location
will represent student voting solidarity.

“The Union is also a central location
on campus, and I really feel that it will be
symbolic of Pitt’s efforts,” Hallinan said.
“It is the student union, and students will
make their voices heard.” I

‘Grant culture’ and ﬁnanci pressures

I harmful to the mission of

Eric Baldwin
Columnist

This is Pitt’s 225th anniversary.‘

I’ve been at Pitt for the past three
of these 225 years. I love this Uni-
versity and its history, and I am
a proponentof education as a
means to a better life. After be-
ing here for three years, my con-
ceptions of academia have shifted
dramatically. This week’s column
is part of my series on issues in
higher education. This week, I
discuss research grants.
I am by no means against
research funding, nor do 1 dis-
value the role of journals that
serve the academic community.
Research funding is imperative
for the future of scholarship and
for producing new information
..in unresearched areas that will
lead to improvements in society.
The groundbreaking work of No-
bel Prize in- Economics laureate
Daniel Kahneman in behavioral
economics and the recent devel-
opment of an HPV vaccine are the
products of substantial funding
from government and private
research agencies. However, the
focus on obtaining grants has
overcome their original purpose,

...-.,.-
..s...-.

   

which was to facilitate research,
thus creating original knowledge
and pragmatic innovations. Now,
the objective is to get more grant
funding for the sake of bringing in
morelrevenue for the university.

As a consequence of this grant-
obsessed academic culture, espe-
cially in the life and health scienc-
es, there are tenured professors at
Pitt and at other research institu-
tions who have contracts that have
no teaching clause, or guarantee
to the professor that he or she
will never have to teach. To put
it simply: professors who don’t
profess. These people are usu-
ally contracted because of their
demonstrated ability to get grant
money and publish proliﬁcally
and are categorized as research
professors. 

To be a professor is to conduct
research and then disseminate
that work through undergraduate
and graduate courses to students
in addition to publishing the work.
By not teaching, research profes-
sors are neglecting _an important
duty of any career academic. I’m
not implying that professors
should spend more time teach-
ing and less time doing research.
I am advocating that all professors
teach at least occasionally, in or-

   

 

universities
der to disseminate their work to
the next generation of scholars.

When a university allows some-
one to carry the coveted title of
professor, yet permits him or her
"to not teach, it is doing a disser-
vice to students. We are providing
funding and a salary to a person
who willconduct research with-
out any desire or obligation to
disseminate that scholarship to
undergraduates or graduates or
promote their work in the public
discourse. Research institutions
such as Pitt are allowing these
professors to lock themselves in
the ivory tower and never come
out. While it is critical that we not
only maintain but also augment
the current rigor of research pro-
grams at Pitt and at other institu-
tions, we cannot forget what we
are here to do in principle: learn
and teach.

In order to better understand
why institutions push professors
so much to continue getting grant
funding and hold those professors
who do in such high regard, it is
critical to look at what the insti-
tutions are receiving. For every
funded research project, the uni-
versity receives a certain percent-

Dropbox makes file storage easy, but consider other options

Tiemoko Ballo
For The Pitt News

“Cloud” is a hot buzzword in technology
today. Apple, Google, Valve, Microsoft and
just about every other industry-leading
tech company has launched some sort of
cloud—based service or feature set. But the
cloud isn’t just for the major players; one
small company has made its entire liveli-
hood by bringing the beneﬁts of the intan-
gible cloud to the everyday user. Dropbox,
founded in 2007, operates a cloud—based
ﬁle hosting service of the same name,
which is now in use by more than 50 mil-
lion people. So what- is all the cloud fuss
about? What does Dropbox do for you? Is
it worth your time and money?

At a fundamental level, the cloud is a

very simple concept: It’s the remote stor— _

age of your ﬁles, meaning copies of your
data are uploaded to distant servers oper-
ated by some company. This has two major
advantages: it means that somewhere out
there exists another copy of your ﬁles (re-
dundancy) and that you can synchronize
your ﬁles across multiple devices (con-
sistency). Storing important ﬁles only
locally, relying solely on the hard drive
of your computer, is risky. Between the
threat of theft and the chance of a coffee
spill, your laptop just isn’t safe. Luckily,
the cloud has your back, giving you a way

to recover those precious spring break
photos. The cloud also gives you the ability
to sync ﬁles between all your devices, so
you can start an essay on your iPad while
waiting for the 10A, then ﬁnish it on your
laptop when you get home. No flash drive
or email-to-self required.

Dropbox is a very popular way to get
these cloud bene-
ﬁts, offering a free

saving precious memory on a phone. You
can also access your ﬁles by logging in
to Dropbox.com from any computer, so
there’s no need to install.the application
if you want to download a Word docu-
ment to a lab machine. Sharing ﬁles with
friends is also easy: you can generate a
download link for a ﬁle in your Dropbox,
and you are free to

2008, it was something new and inno-
vative. The slick interface, ease of use,
sharing capability and practicality made
it a killer package. Dropbox was one of

the first companies to bring automated
cloud ﬁle hosting to the average user; prior
hosting services relied solely on a browser
interface and required manual upload and
download. But times have changed. While
Dropbox still holds a large share of the
market‘, other similar services are pro-
viding serious competition. S'ugarSync
gives you 5GB of free storage, allows you
to pick which folders you want to sync and
lets you password protect ﬁles. Google
Drive, which encapsulates a rebranding

of Google Docs, allows multiple users to

edit a ﬁle simultaneously, lets you open 30
different kinds of documents right inside
your browser and integrates with other
Google services. Microsoft’s redesign of
SkyDrive lacks cross-platform compat-
ibility, but offers 100GB of storage for a
yearly subscription price exactly half that

age of the total grant to cover “facility and
administration costs.” According to a direc-
tive from the office of Pitt’s chief ﬁnancial
ofﬁcer on May 4 of this year, Pitt’s academic
year 2012-2013 will have an effective facil-
ity and administrative rate -— colloquially
known as overhead cost — of 52.5 percent
and is set to increase for year 2013-2014 to
54 percent. Federal money granted to pro-
fessors to conduct serious scholarly work

is more than cut in half .by the University
under the auspices of overhead costs.

To illustrate this: A grant from the Na-
tional Endowment for the Humanities given
to a professor in the history department in
the amount of $50,000 will be cut, down
to $23,750. I am left perplexed as to what
facility and administrative costs a professor
of history could incur that could validate
the extortion of more than half of their

research funds. If the model for how grant _

money is distributed is shifted to a model
where overhead is proportional to the proj-
ect, perhaps universities will reduce the

push for obtaining grant money and allow
professors to focus more ontheir research
interests and teaching, and less on bringing

WOMEN’S soccre  

Pitt fails to pick up ﬁrst Big East win over Weekend

Donnie. Tasser
Staff Wrz'ter

After another disappointing weekend, the
Pitt women’s soccer team remains winless
in conference play through two weeks of
games.

1 This is the team’s last season as a mem-
ber of the Big East.

5 The Panthers lost a pair of home games
last weekend, falling to Villanova on Fri-
day‘ and No. 11 Georgetown on Sunday, 2-1
and 8-0, respectively, at Ambrose Urbanic
Field in the Petersen Sports Complex.

The Weekend began well, as the Pan-
thers (5—9—1, 0-4-1 Big East) took a 1-0 lead
over Villanova just 10 minutes into the

game. But that goal by junior Katie Lippert,

turned out to be the lone positive in what
was otherwise a disastrous weekend, as
Pitt conceded 10 goals without scoring
any in the next 170 minutes of play. '
After opening the year with a 4-1 record

SPORTS  

—— averaging 1.8 goals per game and giving
up just one —— the Panthers are just 1-8-1
and have been outscored 24-4.

“We have been learning a new style of
play all year, and at times' it has been a
struggle,” junior midﬁelder Danielle Ben-
ner said. “A new defensive style is easier
to learn because, in essence, it’s really just
protect the keeper and get the ball out no
matter what style you run. But offensively,
we have had success on set pieces —— but

’that’s it. When we don’t convert on those,

we can’t seem to find a way to score.”

Villanova 2, Pittsburgh 1

_Lippert’s first goal of the season put
Pitt ahead, but the Wildcats responded to
deny the Panthers what would’ve been a
crucial victory. ..

5 ‘‘[Senior Ashley] Cuba beat a girl up
the sideline and crossed the ball to Alex
[Char1ebois],” Lippert said of her goal.

 

The Pitt women's soccer team has struggled mightily since beginning conference play. Huailei Wand | Senior Staff Photographer

“She ‘shot it, and it rebounded to me at
about 18 yards out, and I hit it left—foot
into the top-right corner of the net. I was
just hoping that the defender who was
coming to play me wouldn’t deﬂect it.”

But Villanova (5-6-2, 3-2 Big East)
would come back, tying the game with
eight minutes left in the half and then
taking the lead just eight minutes into
the second half, as Victoria Gersh scored
both goals. ° ’

“It was frustrating,” Lippert said. “We
haven’t had much of an attack all season,
and we ﬁnally did today. To not even get
a tie out of this game was disheartening.”

Pitt outshot Villanova 15-7, and goal-
keeper Nicole D’Agostino made three
saves. ’ * -

First-year Pitt head coach Greg Mille
also expressed his frustration in losing
the game.

COLUMN '

Trout should
win baseball's
MVP

Jeremy Tepper
For The Pitt News

When choosing a side in this season’s Ameri-
can League Most Valuable Player debate,
it’s a matter of new—age logic against old-
age logic. _

Those using the more conventional,
older style of baseball reasoning are ﬁrmly
entrenched on the side of Detroit Tigers
third baseman Miguel Cabrera. They cite
his possible Triple Crown award and deem
this decision an easy one.

On the other side, however, sit the sup-
porters of Los Angeles Angels rookie center
ﬁelder Mike Trout. His_ all-around excel-
lence and incredible numbers make him
worthy of the MVP award.

Count me on the latter side. This one’s a
no-brainer: I would vote for Trout.

-Examining the full body of work of each

-x

player, the decision is rather obvious. Ca— 3.

brera’s candidacy hinges on possibly win-
ning an imaginary award,'the Triple Crown,
which recognizes Cabrera’s leading the

‘league in batting average, home runs and

runs batted in,~while Trout’s case is backed
by overall statistics and his complete excel-
lence in every facet of baseball.

Let’s examine each player’s resumé.

Cabrera is the American League’s best
hitter, I’ll give him that.

The difference between him and Trout,
however, is negligible. Cabrera boasts a .325

batting average, while Trout is hitting .329. 5-

Cabrera’s only real advantage comes in
his power numbers. He leads the league in
home runs (44) and total bases (375), while
Trout has hit'30 home runs and accumu-
lated 311 total bases. The advantage isnot

as signiﬁcant as it seems to be, however, as \,

Trout has played 22 less games. If extrapo-
lated to Cabrera’s 159 games, Trout would
have 35 home runs and 353 total bases,
lowering Cabrera’s advantage considerably.

All things considered, Cabrera is only a
moderately better power hitter than Trout.

The last of the Triple Crown categories
—— RBIs —- is by far my least favorite. This
stat is all about opportunity and where the
player hits in the batting order. Obviously,
Cabrera has more opportunities to drive
in runs, because he hits third.in the order,
while Trout bats ﬁrst.

Needless to say, RBI is an imperfect sta-
tistic.

PITT IN THE NFL

McCoy helps Eagles to
victory over weekend

Dave Uhrmacher
For The Pitt News

Several former Pitt football players
enjoyed successful weekends in the
NFL, highlighted by a 1o0—yard
performance from Philadelphia
Eagles running back LeSean Mc-
Coy. A

McCoy (Pitt running back,
2007-2008) seems to dominate
the New York Giants in the fourth
quarter every time the two meet.
And Sunday night was no different,
as the Eagles held on to a 19-17 vic-
tory against their division rival.

This season, he brought his
average yards per carry in the
fourth quarter up to a whopping
6.4 yards, more than a full yard
greater than his next-best quarter
average. In doing so, the Eagles
also improved their record to 10-
1 in games that M_cCoy gets more
than 20 carries, as compared to a
bleak 20-21 record when he does
not reach that threshold.

“I think we just stuck with it,”

had that feeling —- that feeling that
I wanted the ball.”

The quietest 4-0 team in foot-
ball — the Arizona Cardinals —
received solid contributions from
former Panther Larry Fitzgerald
(Pitt wide receiver, 2002-2003) in
a 24-21 overtime win against the
Miami Dolphins.

Coming off last week, when he
was named NFC Offensive Player
of the Week, Fitzgerald had a key
reception in a fourth-quarter scor-
ing drive that ultimately sent the
game into overtime.

He ﬁnished the day with eight
receptions for 64 yards and a
touchdown.

Meanwhile, LaRod Stephens-
Howling (Pitt running back, 2005-

2008) was sidelined with a groin ,

injury for the Cardinals on Sunday.

Last week, one of the most
inﬂuential Panthers in the NFL,
Darrelle Revis (Pitt defensive back,
2004-2006), suffered a season-
ending ACL tear against Miami.

TEPPER

When base running and defensive sta-
tistics enter the equation, the scale tips in
Trout’s favor.

There’s no perfect way to measure how
capable a player is in these aspects of the
game, but one thing is abundantly clear:
Trout has become arguably the best on
the bases and in the ﬁeld, while Cabrera
remains below average. ’

Trout leads the major leagues with 48
stolen bases. Cabrera can’t threaten de-
fenses with his speed as Trout does’, and
thus, has swiped just four bases.

Finally, Trout is undoubtedly the better

defender. Not only has he made numer— H

ous. remarkable catches this season, but
Trout’s defensive ability has also earned
him-a .987 ﬁelding percentage, compared
to Cabrera’s poor .966. And Trout accom-
plished this while playing an exponentially
more valuable position — center ﬁeld ——
than Cabrera’s third base.

So what do all of these stats mean? Trout

trumps or matches Cabrera in every aspect
except hitting for power, at which Cabrera
is slightly better. A great statistic to quan-
tify all the features of baseball (hitting,
ﬁelding and base—running) is wins above
replacement, or WAR. Basically, WAR is
used to demonstrate how many more wins
any given player is worth than a “replace—
ment level” player — T a minor—league or
bench player —- at his position. According
to Baseba1l—reference.com, Trout leads Ma-
jor League Baseball in WAR at 10.7. Cabrera,
on the other hand, sits ateighth, with a 6.8
WAR. A full four wins is an immense margin
and should clearly paint Trout as the MVP
of the American League. ~ 3- A;

This argument isn’t meant to denounce
the season Cabrera achieved.

He’s had a fantastic season — an MVP-
caliber season, really. 

But Trout is a once—in—a-generation tal-
ent.—— arguably the best ﬁve—too1 player

since Ken Griffey _]r., who lit up basebal-If

with the Seattle Mariners. H
Even'though.it’s his rookie season, Trout
deserves to win this; award. I

“I felt like this was a game we could’ve
won,” Miller said in a press release. ‘‘I felt
like we had a lot of energy, we got an early
goal — a 1-0 lead that we haven’t had for
a while — and we had a great game plan.
Then we made some mistakes that led to
Villanova goals.”

Georgetown 8,) Pittsburgh 0
The Hoyas came into the game ranked

No. 11 in the country, and they lived up to
their ranking in every way.

Georgetown (11-1-1, 5-0 Big East) broke
the game open early with a goal made by
sophomore Daphne Corboz, who scored
two goals in the opening three minutes.

Corboz then completed her hat trick 13
minutes before the half to put Georgetown
up 5-0. She would add two more scores in
the second half to finish with a career-high
ﬁve goals on eight shots.

“The team that was out there wasn’t
us — we didn’t play like ourselves,” Ben-
ner said. “Our heads weren’t in the game,
and the result was embarrassing. We need
to work hard and re-focus this week and
ﬁnd ourselves.”

Lippert thought that allowing the ‘

fected the team Sunday.

“Friday was so frustrating and upset-
ting, and we didn’t have the best post-
game speech. We had a team meeting on
Saturday and tried to talk things out,”
she said. “But we cameout ﬂat, and they
scored two quick goals, and it felt just like
last season again. I think everybody needs
to focus on what they, individually, need
to do better.”

Lippert also added that the only thing
Pitt can-do now is move forward.

“We need to stop pointing fingers and
focus for this weekend, because we have
two very winnable games that we quite
simply have to win,” she said. .

The loss of Revis was evident on Sunday as
thejets were beaten by the San Francisco
49ers, 34-0. '

Aaron Berry (Pitt defensive back, 2006-
2009) was signed by the Jets to a two-year
contract shortly after Revis was injured in
an attempt to ﬁll the void at cornerback_.

Punting the ball for the 49ers was Andy
Lee (Pitt punter, 2000-2003).

In his ninth NFL season, he continues to
show his Pro-Bowl caliber form. Last week-
end, he was able to pin thejets’ offense inside
the 20-yard line twice, while also recording
a booming 61-yard punt, tying his season
record.

Jabaal Sheard (Pitt defensive end, 2007-
2010) recorded his first sack of the year on
Thursday night, in a 23-16 loss to the Balti-

_ more Ravens. He recorded six tackles and
played a key role in containing Baltimore’s
star rusher, Ray Rice, to only 49 yards on
the ground. -

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiverjon Bald-
win (Pitt wide receiver, 2008-2010) logged
four catches for a total of 50 yards in a 37-

20 loss to division-foe San Diego Chargers.
