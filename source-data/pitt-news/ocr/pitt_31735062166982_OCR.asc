Felix Greene To Speak
On Vietnam and China

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

“Instead of the $100 contract
fee due when the housing con-
tract is returned, we are now re-
quiring a $50 fee that must be
returned when the application
for h-ousing is ﬁrst turned in,
with a second $50 due when the
contract is signed,” announced
Ronald Pea-se, director of re-
search and student planning and
acting direct-or of housing.

Pease explained the rationale
behind the change: “First, in
terms of the business operation
of the University we must make
full use of the facilities,” stress-
ed Pease. “We opened last fall
with about 13 beds empty even
after the administration made
last minute calls to commuters
urging them to take d-orm
space.” At approximately $250

day at noon.

how many beds will be open for
commuters‘ and relocates. Third-
ly, we will be able to tell the
admissions oﬁicer earlier how
many free beds there will pos-
sibly be.”

One of the major reasons be-
hind this new policy is that in
the past many students’ who had
no inrtennti-on of returning to the
University requested housing
contracts and then never sign-
ed them. By doing this, they cut

~ off the supply of beds, thereby

making advance planning dif-
ﬁcult.

Applications for housing will
be distributed Wednesday to all
interested students. These appli-
cations with a non-refundable
$50 deposit are ‘due in the Office
of Student Accounts by March
4. Beginning March 1, the Hous-

ing Office, under the direction
of David Ginevan and Miss Lor-
raine Sibbet, new (associate di-
rector of housing, will prepare
contracts until March 31 when
they will be -signed by the stu-
dents, and then sent to parents
of all student applicants. These
contracts must then be signed
and returned to the Office of
Student Accounts with a sec-

ond $50 by May 1, the same due '

date as‘*in previous years. The
entire $100 is then applied to
the following year's room rent-.

Any questions about the new
policies should be directed to
the Office of Student Housing.

“The change in fee deadline
date in no way increases the to-
tal amount of room fee for the
dormitory student," assured
Pease.

Felix Greene will speak Wednesday at noon in the SU Ball-
room on “'l‘-he Czrilses in Vietnam and China.” His speech, spon-
sored by the SUB Pu-blic Affairs Committee, will be followed at
3 p.m. with a Coffee Hour in the Supper Room.

Greene has traveled extensively in China and in 1967 return-
ed from his ﬁﬁth visit there. Chinese officials told him that he has
seen more facets of Chinese life and interviewed more people,

Two University Students

including two interviews with
Prime Minster Chou En-lai, than
any other observer from the
West since Communist rule
came to China. He has written
two books on China, “A Curtain
of Ignorance and Awakened Chi-
na and his ﬁlm, China. won an
award in the 1965 Edinburgh
International Film Festival.

Greene is also an expert in
Southeast Aslian history. He has
been to North Vietnam twice
and has had an exclusive inter-
view with President Ho Chi
Minh, part of which was carried
by CBS. G.reene’s latest book is
entitled Vietnam! Vietnam!

Gamble Rogers
Will Entertain
At Coffee House

After a very successful open-
ing last fall of “The Pit” Cof-
fee House, the Student Union is
looking forward to another week
of conversation, coffee, cokes and
entertainment, today through
Saturday. The Coffee Hou.se wel-
comes all members of the Uni-
versity community. It will be
open from 8-11 p.m. Monday
through Thursday, and from 8
to midnight Friday an-d Satur-
day.

The Hunt Room, turned cof-
fee house by decor and student
waiters and waitresses, will
house and host guitar instru-
mentalist and sin-ger Gamble
Rogers, who comes to the Uni-
versity after a successful week
at Penn State.

Gamble perform-ed for one
year as a member of the Seren-
dipity Singers. Combining back-
grounds in folk-singing, gunitar
instrumental, s-ong writing, story
(tel-ling, and dramatic monolo-
-gues, he has published poetry,
recorded records (including Bev-
erly Believer and Jack Daniels),
and performed at the Bitter End
and Gaslight Coffee Houses in
New York.

lnstituteComputerCompany

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY

Two University undergrad-
uates, Richard Belzer and Ed-
ward Pech_am, have recently
formed the.ir own computer con-
suiting company. The company
was set up to design software
(com-puter programs) to custo-
mers in the Pittsburgh area. Bel-

zer is president and Pech-an
serves as vice-president.

Both Beltzer and Pechan work-
ed at the University Computer
Center before setting up the
business. Beltzer had been at
the center part-time for a year,
while Pechlan was a full-utuime
staff member. “We gained a lot
of experience and training at the
center,” Belzer commented.

In late November, however,
they decided to -start looking for
jobs outside the center. “We
felt we wanted more work,” Bel-
zer said.

By the middle of -December
they found a. job with the Uni-
versity Reseaoh Center and be-
gan writing programs for them.
A short time later, however, they

term jobs. “The rates are high,”
he said, “but we do the job fast-
er, actually saving the company
money in the long run.

“We're really enjoying being
on our own,” Beltzer said. “We
do a variety of work. It's differ-
ent from the center. There's
more pressure and we're expect-
ed to get the job done faster.”

Belzer went to say that “h-av-
ing our own business is a real
challenge to us. In order to build
it bigger we have to go to peo-
ple and sell ourselves and our
services,” he added.

Computer Implementation Sys-
tems (CIS) does not have an
official business office. The com-
pany uses Belzer’s home address.

“i think it’s the best thing to
happen to Inc,” Belzer comment-
ed. “I’m more concerned that
work should be top notch be-
cause it reﬂects on our business
image.”

Representative Speaks

McCartl1yites Rally

by BEVERLY LOU TAYLOR

Calling fo-r an “arsenal in idea-s riot in killpower,”.Representa-
tive Don Edwards of California urged support Olf presidential can-
didate Eugene McCarthy.

Edwards spoke to a compact audience at the McCarthy Rally
held in Carnegie Lecture Hall Friday night. Outside, Pittsburgh
drivers were paralyzed in queues of stopped traffic’ on the snow-
clogged streets.

“We must help to prove that our country is a great demo-
cracy,” said Edwards. “We must transform the polite debate and
the demonstrations in the street into hard political fact. It is ob-
vious the administration will not listen to us.”

Edwards stated that one week of war in ‘Vietnam costs the
same as a year's «total outlay for anti-poverty. Il‘hus, “dependent,
needy American children even «too young to ‘be drafted have be-
come pawns in the war game,” Edwards declared. “The philoso-
phy in Washington is that America is rich, -smart, and strong
enough to have both guns and butter.” But the California repre-
sentative reminded his {audience that rebuilding of jobs, educa-
tion, and housing waits on ‘the end of the war.

“Let there be no mistake about it. This war is Mr. Johnslon‘s
war,” Edwards pointed ou.t. “'Ilhere were no American ﬁghting
ﬂorces or bombings in Vietnam until Jolhnson became Presiden .”

Edwards expressed his fear that unless a new direction is
taken, there will be other Vietnams. Citing the unheavels in Asia.
Aﬁnica, and South America as a search for change from weak
economies and poverty, he said that they are willing to listen to
what the communists have to say. Our bombs aren’t helping. We
should participate in the spirit of these upheavals, offering aid,
guidance, and inspiration as these peoples rid themselves of
colonial bondage. ’

discovered that the center pro-
hibited its employees from ac-
cepting consulting jobs from in-
side the University. Belzer stat-
ed that the two partners “real-
ly appreciated the fact that the
center allowed us to ﬁnish the
job."

The work was so scucce-ssful
that Belzer and Pechan decided
to leave their jobs at the center
and start their own consulting
business on -a full-time basis.
“We were concerned about leav-
ing a steady job," Belzer said,
“-but after checking several pos-
sibilities we decided to try to

ing involves. going out for short ,

The Stronger by August Strind-
berg and Something Unspoken
by Tennessee Williams opened
last weekend in the University
Friday Night Theatre. There
were two performances of the
double bill on Friday night, and
a special performance on Sat-
urday night which was booked
by the Women’s Association of
the University. The plays will
be performed again o-n Feb. 16
and Feb. 23 at both 7:30 and
9:30 p.m. Tickets are currently
on sale for the Feb. 16 perform-
ances at 1117 CL for $1.

Both plays dramatize a pow-
er struggle between two wom-
en. An effective contrast is pro-
vided by the two playwrights
attitudes toward their charac-
ters. Strindberg draws a sharp,
unsentimental picture of wom-
ankind as cruel and possessive,
while Williams tempers the
harshness o-f his female char-
acters by; his insight into their
emotional starvation.

Both productions are directed
by Donna Jean Beiswenger, a
graduate degree candidate in
the University’s Department of
Speech and Theatre Arts. The
cast includes Wandalie Henshaw
and Harriet Allen.

ROTC Initiates Ranger Co.

The ROTC Cadet Brigade has
a new addition to its organiza-
tional chart. It is the Ranger-
Reconn-aissance Company (Coun-
terguerilla), recently formed
among the cadet personnel.

The purpose of the Ranger
Company, says Cade Comman-
der Eric Jessup, are to provide

practical classroom and ﬁeld’

training in order to qualify se-
lected cadet volunteers in scout-
ing and patrolling, small unit
ranger and special warfare op-
erations, and to improve the
leadership in the Corps of Ca-
dets. The cadre of the “Rang-
ers” also try to orient the ca-
dets in the skills and techniques
of ﬁeld craft, survival, escape
and evasion, use of various
weapons and unarmed close
combat.

As presently organized, the
Ranger-Reconnaissance Compa-
ny consists of a Company Head-
quarters and two detachments.
Every perspectilve Ranger mus.t
be a vo-luntter, and be enrolled
in ROTC. He must be in top
physical condition and must also
sign a statement of release from
liability. Each member is re-
quired to maint-a-in a 2.0 over-
all QPA and a 2.5 in ROTC.

Editorial: The Losing Syndrome

The resignation of Varsity Basketball Coach Bob Timmons raises
serious questions concerning the future of “the big times athletics” at
the University.

Last week we indicted Coach Timmons for making a great number
of recruiting faux pas. But we nonetheless question whether it was Tim-
mons who was the instigator of a poor history of basketball recruitment.
We still wonder why Timmons befell the same fate as Coach John
Michelosen? In short, we ask if the decline in sports at the University
has been rooted in poor coaching personnel or in an unfavorable ‘institu-
tional environment?

Far too few of us are aware that Bob Timmons had the awesome
task of simultaneously being head recruiter and head coach. We feel
that this is too much of a burden for any man to handle effectively.

With the dual task of recruiter and coach, it is no wonder that the
basketball team has suffered defeat after defeat. And even Athletic
Director Frank Carver admits “defeat breeds defeat.” If this is the
case why must all head coaches at the University also act in the position
of head recruiter for their sport.

Coaches here, however, have much more to worry about than the
endless task of recruiting—they must work within the quagmire of the
University's institutional framework. While recruiting burdens are a
facet of the athletic problem, we believe that a number of institutional
agreements and decisions are at the grass roots of the problem.

The football program is burdened and immensely‘ slowed down by
the consequences of the Four School Agreement. This agreement between
the University, Syracuse, Penn State, and West Virginia, limits each
school to 100 athletic scholarships over a four year period.‘ This severely

The Viet Story

 

limits the normal growth and development of the freshman ballplayers
for with the limited number of players, they are relegated to practice
against the varsity rather than practicing as a team.

More importantly, the standards at the University are not at all
congruent with those of the schools we compete against. This means
that other schools not only can recruit ballplayers in greater numbers,
but can also enroll an athlete who has" abominable academic qualifica-
tions.

Within this framework, the entire athletic program is at a gross
disadvantage. How can the University recruit scholar-athletes when other
schools maintain a vast network of recruiters, grant more scholarships,
and build more adequate facilities? The simple answer is that under the
present circumstances, we can’t.

We feel that the University is faced with a real dilemma. If the staff
of the University wants the return of “big time athletics”, a number of
changes will have to be made. The University will have to drop out of
the Four School Agreement which will enable more athletic scholarships
to be granted. Moreover, a concerted effort will have to be made to build
a professional recruiting staff with sufficient funds to operate effec-
tively.

The choice that confronts the University is to either maintain the
status quo and suffer from the humiliation of being considered the hotbed
of athletic mediocrity or to make the institutional changes necessary to
procure a viable athletic program that can compete successfully in the
arena. of “big time athletics.” And we ‘strongly suggest that the choice be
made soon.-—P.A.S.

Letters to the Editor

 

First - Hand Horror

The recent Viet Cong all-out assault on the
ci-ties in North Vietnam was a dramatic turn of
events in the war. As Senator Everett Dirkson
said, it is the “death rattle” of the Viet Cong. I
decided to go to Vietnam and ﬁnd out for myself.

I, got off the plane at Saigon and walked into
the city to see what was happening. Almost im-
mediately I noticed a young Vietnamese woman
walking towards me.

“Hey,” she said,” you want ﬁcky-ﬂick? Only
two dollah.”

“Uh, no, not really,’ I said, “I really just want-
ed to ask you some questions.” I was a little
embarrassed.

“You are American, no?”

“Then how come you no want lickey-tick?

“W-ell, I’m a journalist, and I just wanted to
ask you some questions about the latest Viet
Cong offensive. Many of our Government offi-
cials have been saying that the offensive will

‘result in the Vietnamese people hating the Viet

‘Jon , because of all the chaos it has caused.”
“Yes, those miserable Viet Cong; we all hate

V them,” she said vehemently.

“Oh, could I ask why?”

“Well, many years ago when I was a. girl-
livlng in my village, we pushed the French out
of Vietnam. I was so proud! Ho Chi Minh was
our hero, the George Washington of Vietnam.
One day I even saw lrim in person, in a car pass-
in-g through our village. He waved at me.

“But then a terrible thing happened! We were
going to hold elecitiions, and everybody knew that
Ho was going to win. Then, just as we were
about to vote Times Magazine said that Ho was
a Communist! Imagine our s-hock! When Ngo
Dien Diem said there wouldn't be any elections,
we were all really relieved. If you can’t trust
your own army to run your country, who can you
trust? Right then and there, I swore I'd never
trust Ho again.”

“What happened then?” I asked.

“My parents, my three brothers, and myself
moved back to my old village in South Vietnam,
and began to grow rice again. Right after we
moved back we had a little bit of trouble, but it
cleared up. You see, the local landlord, the broth-
er-in-law of our Provaice Chief said that he owned
our land now, and that we were working for
him. Imagine that! We were all mad, because
we loved our land. My brother, V0, left us and
joined the Viet Cong. He said that they were
ﬁghting to get back our land.

“Then your governm-ent said that the Viet

I Oon-g was Communist! We always knew that

the Viet Cong was bad, but Communist! We
may be ignorant peasants, but we know about

, the Communists. They're the ones that want to

take the land away from the landlords.
“But I have to admit I did have some doubts,
since my brother was fighting with them. So

i -the first time he came home to visit, I asked him
about it». I+,I.,esadd that °“”.‘8°"¢““‘“n¢‘"t.Wa'-°- om":

rupt, and that the money we were paying t-o our
landl-om‘ was just lining his pocket, and that we
would never have elections. He said he wanted
us to live in freedom and equality. I have to
admit I had my doubts about him until then,
but everybody knows that ‘Freedom’ is a Com-
znunist line. After all, your President had said
we already were living in Freed-om. If it wasn't
for those dirty Viet Cong, the government would
probably even let us vo-te. So I did what I had
to do. I turned in my brother.”

“I guess after that things calmed down,” I
said.

, “Well, no, not really. There was a corruption
scandal, an.d it turned out that our province chiefs
and village chiefs had collaborated with the
Army to steal our taxes and our AID money
from the United ‘States. Naturally this was up-
setting, bu-t President Johnson pledged that South
Vietnam would be ridded of corruption. That set-
tled it‘; The new Army commander put in his
-brother-in-law, and everything was all night
again.

“Then. right after we got the strategic ham-
let working, we found out that another Army
officer was in charge. You have to realize that
he wasn’t a Communist, but that didn't make my
other -two brothers happy, so they ran away
and joined the Viet Cong too. Thank God they
were killed by your napalm. They said they
wanted to liberate our hamlet, the liars. You
can never trust a Communist.

“We went through a bad spell after that. We
were told that we would have to move into re-
settlement areas. So the Army burned our vil-
lages again and took our belongings to store until
it was safe. An army private is protecting my
bullock, a sergeant has got my cl-othing, and the
lieutenant promised to keep my jewelry safe. So
I moved into the resttlement hamlet right after
your planes napalmed the strategic hamlet to
make sure it didn't fall into the hands of the
Viet Cong. When we got there, however, I dis-
covered that I had no way to make a living. But
then I discovered that you nice Americans liked
ﬁckey-ﬁck. I now live very well, although my
father ran away to join the Viet Cong.”

This brings us up to the current,” I said.
"What do you think is going to happen?”

“Well, General Westmoreland said that 20,000
Viet Cong have been killed so far, so we all know
that the War is almost over. It's a good thing,
too. When those treacherous dogs overran Sai-
gon, you Americans were forced to bomb the
city. Those dirty Viet Con-g! When I saw your
napalm drop on my little cousins, I wanted to
go out and kill them all. If it wasn't for the
Viet C-ong, you Americans would’nt have to kill
my three brothers, destroy my villages, and sup-
port all those Army officers. If you Americans
weren't around, only God knows what my life
would be like. You sure you don't want to ﬁckey-
tick?”

  

 

Senior Knocks
Student Records

Editor, The Pitt News:

This letter might have been
more appropriate if written a
month ago, but as a graduating
senior, there are more impor-
tant things to worry about. I
am talking speciﬁcally about
Pit-t’s registration process. I
could write a small bo-ok about
incidents I and others have had
with Student Records; lost class
cards, misplaced grades (hope-
fully, sometimes), etc. But that
is another problem. The main is-
sue I wish to bring forth is that
I was almost forced to take ﬁve
unwanted courses my last term
at Pitt. I registered the third
possible day, and subsequently,
upon receiving my pre-registra-
tion card, instead of the 15 cred-
its I signed up for, there was
one: Gym 3.

Upon returning to school in
January, I spent four days run-
ning up and down stairs, eleva-
tors, wasiiting in lines, and get-
ting just plain angry. To make
a long story short, after some
fast talking and pleading, I got
into three of the ﬁve cou.rses I
originally registered for, a bet-
ter average than most students
achieve. The point is this: Why
in my last term here must I
take courses which I have no
interest in, but rather takes one-s
which even freshman have turn-
ed down.

As many other -schools do, even
so-called “lesser institutions” like
Penn State, graduating seniors
/have registration priority; so
should Pitt's seniors, if only as
a token gesture from the Ad-
ministration for getting through
three and one-h-alf years of wait-
ing in Student Record lines. I
can’t beneﬁt anymore, but may-
be someone else hopefully will.

Student Hits
Use of Funds

Editor, The Pitt News:
The opening of the Hillman

Library and the new facilities
in the Student Union present a
complex challenge to the future
of our Universi-ty. Obviously,
academic quality cannot be im-
proved by chrome plating, and
therefore it is distressing to see
money diverted into superﬁcial-
ities that will do nothing more
than impress those people least
worth impressing.

I am concernced because the

University is developing facil-
iities that will provide a type o-f
ureceration only the most deca-
dent members of the commun-
 
about current social and politic-
sal crises. Trivial minds can al-
ways say that the Hillman Li-
«brary and the new Student
Union Lounge are signs of “pro-
gress.”

The library, however, just
brings our fa-ciilties up to a gen-

_ eral status quo, while plush

seats and pool tables are simply
a step toward a “Guilded Age"
if-or Pitt. Meanwhile, ideas such
as “The Pit” Coffee House stand
in the wings waiting for funds,
money that looks like it will
never appear. A subtle analysis
of the facts might conclude that

the Adminisntration is trying to
direct the potentials of construc-
tive debate and resulting actions
into a junkyard of of contem-
porary diversions, thus render-
ing the student body impotent.

The events of April, 1967,
which exhibited no social con-
cern, must serve to remind stu-
dents and administrators alike
of the capabilities of irrate stu-
dents-. I take this opportunity
to advise the University com-

‘munity that marble and teak
' improve learning and under-

standing only to a limited de-
gree, and that the so very ur-
gent problems of our society
cannot be solved over a pool
table.

Richey Stuns New York With 8:48.4 Two Mile ,
Frosh Runs Third Behind                   

Lindgren’s 8:43 at Garden

by JAY ROSENSTEIN, sports Editor

Jim Bannersat silently in the coaches’ row along the
Eighth Avenue side of Madison Square Garden, a stop
watch clutched firmly in his hand. He was in that section
for the ﬁrst time and last time Friday night, but it wasn't the nos-
talgia of the Gar-tlenis ﬁnal track meet or the steady roar of the
15,000 buffs which caused him to tighten his grip on the little time

piece.

Rather is was the track an-
nouncer’s call fo-r the two mile
run. Gerry Lindgren’s race. Lind-
tgren, America's best long dis-
tan-ce runner for the past four
years. Lindgren, a m-ember of
the Olympic team before he
ever ran in college. Gerry Lind-
gren, the class of the Garden
Invitat:ional’s two mile.

Banner knew all about Lind-

‘gren. But he also knew all about

the green freshman he brought
to New York to face the best.
And Banner was giving Jerry
Richey a shot at the upset.

The plan called for Richey to

K wherever Lindgren went, like a

linebacker keying on a fullback.
And Richey followed Banner’s
instructions religiously.

V Starting from the outside lane,
Richey avoided the josting of
the 11 man ﬁeld by ‘streaking
into second place behind the
pace-setting Lindgren. At the

Hoover Pins
Foe In 1:58

by ROY JACOBS

Several wrestlers had a
little trouble with the out of
bounds circle in Saturday’s
meet with Franklin and Mar-
shall, but not enough to keep
the maltmen from overwhelm-
ing the Diplomats, 23-9, on High

,, School Wrestling Day at the
Field House.

Bruce Unan-gst, varsity 123
pounder, probably wishes the
28-foot diameter of the wrest-
ling circle was longer, while 152
pounder Jim Rhone would have
been better off if the circle were
not quite so wide. If either had
been the case, the grapplers’
margin of victory would have
been larger.

Unangwst completely domin-
ated F&M’s John Hilliard, 20-2,
in the opening match of the af-
ternoon, but the end line cost
him two chances to pin. his op-
pont. I'IJlS points included three
predicaments and a near fall.

Rhone wasn’t quite as fortun-
ate. Wrestling the Diplomats’
top man. Jim Clair, Rhone held
a slim 54 lead with less than
30 seconds to go. Clair had a
point for riding time, so ‘Rhone
had to avoid being taken down
to ﬁnish ina draw. In his de-

sire to avoid Clair’s takedown

move, Rhone was penalized a
point for deliberately going off
the mat, subsequently losing a
6-5 decision. ,

Afterwards, coach Dave A-dams
had mixed emotions about the
meet.

“It was good to win one,”

commented Adams, “but it was

not our best performance by
any means. On the whole we did
a good job, but we were slu-g-
gish in spots.”

One of the spots where Adams
was quite pleased was with the
upper weights. Although earlier
in theweek Adams was unsure

S how his bigger boys would

wrestle, the matmen took four

I of -thevﬂnal ﬁve bouts.

end of the ﬁrst mile, 4:21.7 later,
Richey still lay second. Each
lap seemed like an instant re-
play of the lap before. Richey,
on the heels of the smooth-strid-
ing Lindgren, and Ethiopia's
Sebsibe Mamo, running easily
in third.

Their positions remvainded un-
changed until the last quarter
when Mamo slipped past Richey
on the turn. But it wasn't until
the last lap that Richey lost
contact with Lindgren as the
Washington senior outkicked
the ﬁeld to win in 9:43 ﬁat. Rich-
ey crossed the ﬁnish line in
8248.4, 20 seconds faster than he
had ever run two miles before,
and 30 seconds faster than any-
one in a Pitt uniform had ever
done.

“Everyone was talking about
it,” Banner ‘bubbled the next
day. “A freshman running 8:484
indoors. They couldn’t believe

Jack Kuhn rides his man out at 167.

“I was pleased with the way
it turned, especilly with (Tony)

Truitt hurt,” remarked Adams.-

“Kuhn’s match (167) did a lot
to restore Ja.ck’s conﬁdence.
Trax did a good job at 160. Tim’s
one of the best kids with a 2-6
record around.” Both Trax and
Kuhn won de-cisi-ons, 5-1 and 5-0,
respectively.

Two wrestlers, whom Adams
didn’t mention, also made key
contributions. With F&M trail-
ing 15-9 and two matches to go,
either Randy Kahler (191), or
Terry Hoover (heavyweight) had
to win to clinch the match. Both
came through.

Kahler, in only his second
match of the season, wrestled
the Diplomats’ top sophomore
Aaron Malinsky. Late in the
second period, he trailed 3-0. Two
takedowns in the last minute
and a half gave him a 7-4 win.

Hoover was taken down in
the ﬁrst minute of his match,
but in the ﬁnal 40 seconds of
the ﬁrst period he escaped, got
a takedovvn, and pinned his man
to send 750 high school guests
home buzzing about Pitt-._

crowd earlier in the meet with

a 3:57.6 mile and Banner -could- a

n’t help but say, “Jerry will be
the one they’ll be cheering next.”

In Baltimore Saturday night,
Richey showed the effects of
the night before. “My legs were
heavy, their were tight before I
started. If I could -have come in
fresh, I could have won,” Rich-
ey said. As it was, he ﬁnished a
strong third once again, with a

Sprinter Dave Garnett also
competed in both meets. And
G«a~rne<tt’~s competition was prob-
ably tougher than Richey’s In
his trial heat at the Garden, Gar-
nett faced the co-hlolder of the
world indoor record at 60 yards,
Charley Greene. In the bmks
to the right of Greene was a
fellow named O. J. Simpson.

Garnett ran well. Banner had
him clocked in 6.4 seconds,
which {put him fourth in his heat
and should have qualiﬁed him
for the ﬁnals. But there was a
dead heat in the second trial
which caused the officials to
cancel the runoff.

“I was unhappy over their
decision,” said Banner. “By
scheduling another race, they
owed it to all the runners to
have it But that’s track.” Gar-
nett also ﬁnished fourth in Bal-
timore. “He was too tight in
N. Y.,” Banner explained, “so I
told him to be looser. And like
any freshman, he took it too
loose and didn't dig. But he
didn't come in last either night,”
Banner smiller.

Bryant Salter high jumped

John Thomas’ seven feet. Ban-
ner was also pleased with Rog-
er Ho-1ly’s losing effort in the

the coach excused.

‘Red’ Bailey Lights A Cigar
As Little Dukes Dump Cubs

by JERRY GRUEBEL

Duquesne freshman basketball coach Al Bailey is be-
coming more and more like ex-Boston Celtic coach Red
Auerbach with each additional game that his team plays.
Since beating the freshman blalsvketball team two weeks and
three games ago, Bailey has become more pompous, more of a

cry baby, and more of a win-
ner. And Bailey reached his
peak yesterday by lighting a
victory cigar in the ﬁn-al min-
utes of Duquesne’s 80-55 win
over the Cubs.

Although the Little Dukes
won easily and were never lead-
ing by less than six (12-6), Bail-
ey continuously complained. He
complained at virtually every
other call made by the referees;
he complained when his team
made one of their rare mistakes,
and he was near t-ears when the
Little Dukes had the ball and
didn’t score.

And Bailey was more ‘pompo-
us in yesterday's trouncing at
the Civic Arena than when his
Duquesne Frosh dumped the
Cubs mat the Field House two

 -weeks ago.

 

“Pitt played a conservative
game of basketball,” s-aid Bailey
in an almost apologetic excuse
for not scoring 100 points.

Late in the second half, Bail-
ey could‘be heard telling every-
one that the Cubs had won a
moral victory by holding his
team to under 100 points. It was
only the third time that the Lit-
tle Dukes didn't reach triple
ﬁgures.

But once again Bailey ﬁnish-
ed the game in the same posi-
tion Red Auerbach often found
himself in i.e. as the whining
coach. And the win was Bailey's
tenth in as many games.

The Cubs will try to recover
tomorrow mght against west-

minster.

Panthers

Titans

by MIKE BROURMAN
Assistant Sports ‘Editor

The Panthers handed re-
tiring coach Bob Timmons
a 74-70 victory Saturday
night at Lafayette, but accord-
mg to co-capt-ain Ken Bollens it
was not the game the players
want to give Timmons as a go-
ing-away present.

“If there’s one I want to win,
it’s Westminster,” said Bollens.
“I think everyone feels the same

way.” The ca-gers host the 

tans tomorrow night at 8:15 in
the Field House.

“That team wasn't rough,”
commented Bollens about Lafay.
ette. “We shouldn't have had
much trouble with them any-
how. I'd m-uch rather bea.-t West-
min-soter for the coach, sdnce
they're a traditional rival and
everything.”

Actually. the Panthers did
have a lot of trouble with Lafay.
et¢e- Led by Tony DeLisio, they
broke open a 36-36 halftime time
and «surged to a 55-46 advantage
before the Leopards began a
strong comeback.

Lafayette _cut the margin to
four points in the closing min-
utes, but was then forced to
foul to try and get the ball. It
was the foul line which saved
the Panthers, just as it had
helped destroy them the week
before at Fordham.

Westminster already owns one
victory over the cagers, «a. 79-70
win at New Wilmington. ,In that
game, the Panthers were hurt
by 8 press. “That shouldn’t hurt
us too much here,” Bollen said.
“They Press much better on
their own court.”

“What we'll have to do to beat
them.” Bollens continued, “Is to
hit the boards better and shoot
better. They killed u-s on the
boards 1113 there. We have to
hustle, more.”

The Lafayette win was the
Panthers sixth against ten loss-
es. After Westmvinster, the op.
position gets rougher until the
ﬁnal game with Carnegie-Me1]0n_
There won't be many more

chances for giving Timmons a_

cagers better make every one
count. ~

Compared to the hallway out-
side, it’s always warmer in Bob
Timmons’ office. And it seems the
office's black wooden arm-chair, imprint-
ed with Pitt’s veritas et virtus symbol, al-
ways feels- more comfortable than other

wooden chairs-

But by next month, the office will be-
come another brick-like feature of the
Fitzgerald Field House. Bob Timmons is

leaving the coaching business.

When he goes, Timmons takes with
him all those pictures hanging in his of-
fice. They represent the better moments
of 15 years of basketball coaching, and
they represent the moments when basket-
ball was still a fun game for Timmons.

“The fun sorta goes out of it when
you get older I guess,” said the 55-year-
old Timmons. “Get a little older, you lose
the enthusiasm and you don’t have the

patience.”

“It isn’t coaching, so much,” Timmons
explained, “but today the effort is on re-

cruiting.”

Mass. Hands OWIS Tack Sixth LOSS
Gym Team On Swimmers, 5945

Ninth Loss

by CHUCK DWORAK

Dave Shidemantle was
sidelined for the second
straight week on the long-
horse as Massachusetts handed
the -gymnasts their ninth straight
loss, 177.35-102.65.

“The le-g is still bothering
him,” said coach Warren Neig-
er. “He has to watch that hard,
ﬁasat run he must make before
the vault to prevent re-injury."

Shidemantle, however, still
managed to grab a second-p-lace
tie in ﬂoor exercise with an 8.80,
and he also scored third on the
trampoline with a 6.95.

Massachusetts was paced by
all-around man Rich Reed, who
took wins on the still rings with
an 8.85 and parallel bars with
an 895. Bob LeClair had the
top performance of the day with
a 9.10 on the s-idehorse, and Bill
Godwin won the ﬂoor exercise
with a 9.0. Mike Kasavana. won
the tramp event with an 8.65.

“Mas-sachuseltts is having its-

best season in six years,” oom-
mented Neiger. “They may wind
up among the t-op ﬁve teams in
the E%IG~L (Eastern Intercollegi-
ate Gymnastic League), and Le-
Clair, Kasavana, and Reed will
be pretty t-ough in the Easterns.”

Varsity gymnasts Tom Fisher
and Bob Dodson brightened
their hopes for the Easterns on
the still rings and the parallel
bars, respectively. D-ods-on scored
-an 8.1 on the bars and Fisher
had an 8.05 on the rings.

After a week layoff, the gym-
nasts’ next meet will be their
season ﬁnale at home Feb. 24
«against Penn State, a team in
contention for the Eastern cham-
pionxsllip.

Two hungry swimming
teams met Saturday after-
noon in Philadelphia. At the
ﬁnal touch, the Temple Owls
proved the hungrier of the two
by just no-sin-g out the swim-
mers, 59-45, -in their closest meet
of the season. .

Hampered by a small pool,
illness, and a long car trip, the
swimmers performed extreme-
ly well, according to coach Bill
Grant. “The kids really had a
good representative showing,”
he -said. “They did real well, and
if Chris Price had been feeling
better, the outcome could have
been reversed.

“Chris seemed to be under the
effects of the ﬂu and was not up
to par,” explained Grant. Price
swam a leg of t-he winning 400-
yard medley team (along with
Rich and Howard Norris and

Gene Hoffman), but didn't fare.

to well in the 200-yard breast-
stroke and 200-yard individual

medley. “I just couldn't turn it
on when I needed it,” noted
Chris.

Grant felt that the turning‘
point of the meet came in the

500-yard freestyle event when '

Temple’s number two man Tom
Morris just edged the swim-

mer’s Pete Ream for third place. I

“That one point gave them the
incentive and a 51-37 lead with

two events left,” said Grant sad- I

lye

Both Ream and Gene Hoffman -' ‘

had their best day of the year.
“Pete swam a 11:50 in‘-the 1000-
yvard freestyle which was his
best time ever,” noted Grant. .
“And in the 500 freestyle, he
gave us quite a thrill for 375
yards as he swam neck and
neck with Temp1e’s top distance-
man, Bob Whelan.

“Gene did a real ﬁne job in
the indiVlid11‘al medley and possi-
bly set a new record in captur-
ing the 200-yard breaststroke.

less job you do coaching,” Timmons said,
and then added in an afterthought, “now
if I had two full-time recruiters . . .”
Effective at the end of the season,
Timmons will be given an instructor’s
job in the Physical Education Program.
He always considered himself a teacher,
even when the former Athletic Director
Tom Hamilton named him head coach in‘

In those years, coaches usually didn't
have contracts, Timmons pointed out. “I
never had a contract. Hamilton said I had
the job until I got ﬂed-up with it,” he said.

Apparently, Timmons did get fed-up.
It’s not easy to lose again and again as
his teams have done the last four years,
and not feel the pressure.

“You get discouraged when you do:nv’t
win. You put pressure on yourself. You
coach harder,” retorted Timmons.

you feel that maybe you’re not doing the
job. Maybe you’re not getting across to
the players,” Timmons added, offering a

But what does it mean to make an ath-
letic personnel change at Pitt? “Defeat
breeds defeat,” claims Athletic Director
Frank Carver. Can a new head coach in-
stitute a winning formula, under the same
setup which forced Timmons to resign?

Right now Carver realizes that ath-
letics are suffering because of the school’s
financial crisis of three years ago. In bas-
ketball, Carver knows the school must
change its face.

But Carver and the Athletic Commit-
tee are in “no hurry” to name a new
coach.

“We can’t conceive of an older, suc-
cessful coach at a major school making
the change,” Carver says. “Our basic
category will be assistant coaches at a
winning school, small college coaches,
former Pitt graduates who coach, and
winning high school coaches.”

And in the same breath, Carver almost
could have said, “And I hope the new
coach can do the job.” '

For even ’I‘immons was once a winner.
He can prove it not only in the record
book, but especially by the picture which
shows the players from his 1962-63 team
carrying Timmons on their shoulders after
beating Duquesne in the Steel Bowl.

Students Announce Results

Survey Has Rocky over LB]

by ELI GOLDMAN

According to the results
of a survey of student poli-
tical opinion, Governor Nel-
son Rockefeller of New
York could defeat Presi'dent
Johnson by a two to one
margin in the upcoming Presi-
dential election. Strong show-
ings were also made by Gov.
Ronald Reagan, Senator Oharles

‘Percy of Illinois, and Senator

Robert Kennedy of New York.
None of these canidlates approx-
imated Gov. Rio-ckerfellerﬁs pap-
ularity although all were close
to that of President Johnson.

Lt should be noted, however,
that the survey, conducted in
early November by Donald E.
Lampert and Paul R. Horns-tein,
junior political science majors,
was taken prior to the announce-
ment of the candidacy of Sena-
tor Eu-gene McCarthy of Minne-
sota.

In one one of the questions
in the survey, students classi-
ﬁed their own political orienta-
tion. According to Lampert,

“About 41 per cent of the 1,010
students sampled considered
themselves liberal or ultra-llib-
eral. On the other hand, 20 per
cent considered themselves con-
servative vvhile 39 per cent were
moderates.”

With this in mind, opinions of
students on certain key issues
were also explored. Of those
sampled, 80 per cent agreed with
the proposition that the United
States should attempt to negoti-
ate a peaceful settlement in Viet-
nam. Similarly, over four-ﬁfths
believe it possible for the US
and the Soviet Union to peace
fully coexist.

On the subject of Black Na-
tionalism, the survey indicated
strong disagreement by all
groups, with the execption of
the ulltra-liberals, to the proposi-
tion that “Black Nationalism
will help the cause of the Ne-
gro in America.”

Lampert believed there was
a “problem of perception re-
garding this question.” He said,
