Pitt Police
Awaiting
Settlement

The contract. proposed by the
Campus Police to the University is
still unresolved as negotiations
continue between the Amalgama-
ted Plant Guards Union Local 502

and Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Labor Relations. 1

The contract offered to the
University is patterned after police
contracts that have been ratiﬁedby
the University of Delaware and
several Pittsburgh area colleges, a
Campus Police spokesman said. In
an effort to put the proposed
contract into a comparative econ-
omic perspective, the models have
been studied and compared with
other contracts recently ratiﬁed by
the University, the spokesman said.

Chief union steward John Forgie
and Pitt’s Labor Relations Manager
Tom Cherry claim headway is being
in settling the contract dispute,
although many Campus Police
ofﬁcers remain disenchanted with
negotiations.

“There is a cooperative negotia-
ting, air now in discussing the
‘issues,’ ” Forgie said.

A clarifying addition to Pitt’s
canvassing policy, recently under

‘ ﬁre from the local American Civil/

Liberties Union (ACLU), has been
issued by the Ofﬁce of Student
Activities.

The statement approves several
exterior locations for canvassing
and several interior locations for
campaign and information tables.

Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Student Activities William Marcus

.-..»-said the locations are “high trafﬁc

areas where the students’ object-
ives can be best achieved.“

According to Pitt’s canvassing
policy “University funds, facilities
or services may not be used for any
participation or intervention in a
political campaign on behalf of any
candid_ate for public ofﬁce."

Despite the working of the policy,
Marcus said the University encour-
ages participation in the presiden-
tial campaigns.

The ACLU recently declared that
Pitt’s canvassing policy violates the
First Amendment by “not allowing
a student to voice his political
support.” -

With‘ the clarifying addendu
organizations’ canvassing should"
be headache-free, "provided the
interior locations are reserved
through the propoer ofﬁce, which is
the Student Union reservations
office in most cases. .

 

Paul Nyden Testifies to Review Board .

BY BILL MOORE

Paul.Nyden, an assistant sociol-
ogy professor currently ﬁghting to
retain his teaching position, deliv-
ered three and a half hours of
testimony before the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences (FAS) Tenure and
Promotion Review Board Friday,
continuing to maintain the non-
renewal of his contract was based on
politics, not scholarship.

Nydenpainted a picture of a
University dominated by pro-

industry, pro-military professors-

interested only in obtaining lucra-_
tive research contracts and said he
is being ousted because he refuses
to conform.
V The FAS Review Board is part of
the University’s appeal system for
faculty members. The board will
hear more testimony on Nyden’s
case,.and then make a recommen-
dation to FAS Dean Jerome
Rosenberg.

Nyden i opened his testimony

Friday by saying the formal ‘appeal,

procedures are “vague, overlap-
ping and guarantee the aggrieved
faculty member few rights.”

He also leveled criticism against V

the University for refusing to
release what he said were ﬁve
secret documents relating‘ to his
case.

Nyden went on to criticize many
of his colleagues in the sociology
department, especially sociology
professors Gilbert Shapiro and
Roland Robertson who sat on a
special review committee assemb-
lbed to consider Nyden in
November, 1975.

He claimed Shapiro and Robert-
son were biased against him at the
outset and alleged Robertson had
made a threatening remark after
Nyden had vigorously fought for the

hiring of black faculty members in

the department. Nyden said he had
asked sociology department chair-
man Burkart Holzner to remove the
two men from the three-man
committee, but they weren’t.

Nyden reminded the Review
Board of the numerous national
scholars who have ' praised his
scholarship and his doctoral disser-
tation, and he said he also thought
his teaching was excellent. “I am
conﬁdent that I am one of the

In the addendum issued to the
Student Government Board ‘I by

_Associate Director of Student

Activities Terry Milani, the Board
was» urged to “Point out the
prohibition against the use of the’
University’s name and resources in

‘support of political activities,” as

well as “reinforce the fact that

department’s better teachers,

' which is also reflected in the high

enrollments in my courses,” he
said. ' A

Nyden, who stresses Marxist
thought in his courses and writings,
said that shortly after being hired he
was sent by the department to
attend two conferences at Columbia
University sponsored by the Ofﬁce
of Naval Research. He said after he
showed little interest in the

conference, and skipped parts of the

second one, he was criticized by
Holzner for ‘ ‘unprofessional behav-
ior.”

“I feeliit is innappropriate to
interpret my refusal to be drawn
into research funded by the military
as betraying any lack of professional
motivation,” he said.

He claimed most of the .senior
sociology faculty members were
proﬁtting from numerous research
contracts with the military, steel
companies and coal companies, and
thus were uneasy with his strong
pro-labor and anti-military stands.

BY PAUL MATHEWS

An open hearing will be held
Tuesday to consider revisions, in
the procedures used to pay
students holding leadership posi-
tions in student organizations,
Dave Tive, assistant director of

student affairs, announced last

week,

Tive said the Remunerations
Board, the Student Affairs com-
mitteewhich determines the

_ amount student leaders are paid,

will solicit opinions from all
interested parties.

“It will be an attempt to reach
beyond the various campus student
governments for ideason how to
handle student funding. Input can

be either written or verbal,” Tive
said. ‘

Tom McAndrews, a Student
Government Board (SGB) appoint-
ee to the Remunerations Board,
said the purpose of the open
meeting would i be to receive
student input to help “_get a better
idea of what the Board’s structure
and function should be.”

SGB President Barry Weisband
supported the Board’s open hear-
ing saying, “We will ﬁnally hear
what the student body has to say
about rerrrunerations.

“Since the SGB has no control
over the policies and procedures of

the Remunerations Board,’ I’m glad

to see the remuneration issue is
ﬁnally going to receive some input

from the people it, affects most-—

‘‘In my opinion, the charges are

“It would cost 5 to 10 times as much

Student Government Board
member Chip Hubbard, who
worked to modify the system of fees
for A-V equipment, said the
modifications offer a workable
compromise.

“Student groups will not actually
be‘paying for an operator if we are
allowed by Pitt Programming to use
one of its members to run the
equipment, ’ ’ Hubbard said.

“Of course, if the A-V depart-
ment attaches an additional guide-

to use one of‘ their .department’s
own projectionists, we have to ﬁght
the whole issue again,” he said.

070 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

     First Step Is Made

. The compromise achieved between Student Government Board (SGB)
‘President Barry Weisband and the administration’s senior 
concerning student input inbudgetary matters is a big step in the right
direction. But the senior staff should not consider this the students’ last

“step.

The administration plan calls for students to sit on individual schools

9

budget committees, which is the farthest student participation has ever
gone. Rejected was Weisband’s plan to include a student on the senior

“ staff level budget hearings.

Student participation on these budget committees will provide SGB
with greater insight into Pitt’s budget formation process. SGB can use
the information obtained as a weapon in its never ending ﬁght to oppose

tuition hikes.

What a student and what an administrator consider wasteful spending
can be as different as two sides of a coin. The student representatives
should realize, when picked, that it is theirjob to steer Pitt’s budget to a
state where it beneﬁts students, not gloriﬁes departments. . .

While Weisband’ s proposal was rejected, a clearer explanation why is
needed. Vice Chancellor of Planning and Budget Jack Freeman claims
that the senior staff should be able to meet, without students, to discuss

"‘ ‘sensitive material. ” What material about a school is so sensitive that a
student paying to attend that school carmot know what it is about?
Perhaps this material is not entirely on the up and up. This material

’ would then be of greater student concern.

Now it is up to the chancellor to see  hisproposal 1S approved.
Granted, Chancellor Posvar’s proposal IS a big step forward. But
present and future Student Government Boards should see this as a
stepping stone. Once students gain valuable experience in contributing

to budgetary decisions; once administrators  get It through the“

heads that students can make valuable contributions to budgetary
decisions; then SGB will have enough power to successfully attempt a
move up. They must make the steps to move closer to student
participation on the senior staﬁ budget hearings.

Although that time is near, it is still in the future. Now that student
parti 'pation in budget fonning has been achieved at a high level, the

SGB must focus on the battle at hand. They must roll up their sleeves
and prepare themselves for the coming tuition hike clash. But this time
they will have a new weapon they must know how to use-information.

  Establishment vs. Stereotype

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
They were two old opponents, as
familiar with each other’s punches
and rolls as Bruno Sammartino and

' George “the Anima ” Steel. There

wasn’t a ring in sight Thursday
morning, just a bubble of incredibly
intense light from the television
news lamp around the podium in the
Kurtzman_ room.

The opponents were Drs. Ernest
Sternglass and Bernard V. Cohen,
both faculty members at Pitt, and
both at opposite poles of an
on-going debate over the dangers of

' radiation to human populations.

Originally, public relations peo-
ple for the University had hoped to
hustle Sternglass out of the room
after his press conference in order
to make room for Cohen who was

expected to rebut most of the .

other’s statements.

It didn’t work out that way, and
the circle of reporters were treated
to an unusual spectacle in their
bubble of light: Two professors
slugging it out with every trick in
the academic book.

iSternglass and Cohen look as
opposite as they sound. Stern-

glass’s dark blue suit, quick fervent «

gestures, glasses and slight accent
all combine to form a picture of the
perfect zealot scientist: A cross
between Werner Von Braun and
Pope Paul.

Cohen in ‘his open-necked shirt
and dark green. slacks with a wide
leather belt looked the epitome of
‘the calm, everyday working scien-
tist. He spoke in careful, calm
words.

was some danger to young and
unborn children. He came armed
with a series of xeroxed hand-outs
for the media: new research and
statistics and his burning concern
over the issue.

Cohen was equally convinced.

there was no dangerand came as a"

voice of rationality, of calm; also, a
voice of the profession against the
upstart Sternglass, a dangerous
man.

There in the bubble of light, while ,

the journalists smiled or strained to
follow the piroettes and statistical
talk, Sternglass and Cohen, refer-
ring to each other as “Ernie” and
“bem” waded into each other.

Cohen wasn’t as whet for battle
as Sternglass. At one point he
uneasily commented that this sort of
debate wasn’t best carried on in
front of the all-consuming and
all-recording gun barrels of the
television cameras.

“But I do think this should be
public, I do think sol” ‘Sternglass
said, arms and legs animated, his
sheets of tests and studies ﬂapping.

And that was the crux of the
matter. The heart of the debate.
Sternglass is an animal far different
than your traditional academic.
Convinced he is on‘ the trail of a
potentially fatal element in Ameri-
can life and technology, he carries
the debate into the realm of the
newspaper headline and the
television special. Controversy and
scorn shed off his back like the
proverbial duck. '

Cohen represented the man of the
committee. The older, more
reflective tradition of‘ scientific
inquiry in which colleagues gather
to critically review the work of their

peers and to deliver well’-thought-‘

BY TOM WASELESKI

The snap-crackle-pop stopped.
The cafeteria was so empty that
he’d actually heard the three most
famous words in cereal lingo. It was
just after six a.m. '

And there it sat before him, on
the red plastic tray, ﬂanked by
juice, coffee, two slices of rye toast
and spotted tab1eware—the bowl
over which Sternglass and Cohen
had taken personal shots at each
other.

There were scrambled eggs on
the menu, so it wasn’t as if he had to
eat that. And there were pancakes,

r too. —

’ He wasn’t a milk drinker by habit, _
much to the detriment of his
calcium-starved bones so taking

of light, the public forums, the
public debates, Cohn seemed to be
less at ease than Sternglass. Less
ready to take a blood‘ and guts
offensive.

One mark of the incredibly
Talmudic commentary which ﬁlled
the Kurtzman room, camera ﬁlm
and notebooks was the references to
the same report by Cohen and
Sternglass, each using it to his own
advantage.

Cohen cited blue-ribbon commit-
tees, as he called them, while
‘Sternglass cited new reports and
studies and.the ominous character
of the Nuclear Establishment.

Two days prior to this wrangle in
Kurtzman room, Cohen complained
that students always seemed to be
familiar with the work of Ernest
Sternglass, but were never familiar
with the massive amount’ of data
thrown against him in professional
circles.

“All students know is Stem-
glass,” Cohen said.

And it makes sense. Students
traditionally (if you believe the talk
"about the liberal-oriented college
student) root for the underdog, the
anti-Establishment, the new. Deci-

sion-makers are not students, and ’

neither are the blue-ribbon panels
which Cohen invokes against the.
alarums of Sternglass. The man’s
appeal is unthinkable to them, and
for obvious reasons. ‘
The confrontation in the bubble of
light faded when the television
people began to unplug their
technology. As the light faded, so
did the heat-of the debate.
T But the conflict’s the thing, and if

‘ _it were within either Cohen’s or‘,

Sternglass’ power to remove- the

coffee, tea or Coke with all of his
meals made this the ﬁrst real
confrontation he was to have with
the controversial drink.

the cereal had sunk further into
the bowl, and he was entertaining
the idea that the stuff looked no
different than on any other day
when he had eaten the same thing.

And yet here were two profes-
sionals charging each other essenti-
ally with scientiﬁc bankrupcy over
whether the milk could cause cancer
or increase the’ number of infant
deaths because of the radioactive
fallout it contained..

IMPRESSIONS

He was more inclined to go
with Sternglass who said that
abstaining from milk for four weeks
was well worth the risk. He could
see himself 30 years from now going
in for a series of cobalt treatments.
Where would Cohen be then to tell

come from his milk but from some
preservative in his toast?

every scaremonger like someone to

He looked again at the mushy A
cereal and it didn’t look at all like
ﬁve days in Colorado. Or like living
in a brick house. There were some
things in Cohen’s rationalizations
that he could not relate. ‘

Suddenlyhhe felt toyed with. A
university student content enough
with his standing in his own ﬁeld,
yet at a loss to explain the other 99%
of the things happening aroun@-
him. A sense of smallness huddledg-'l—
over that breakfast tray; the rare
excitement of achievement in his
own field was comparatively
worthless.

A fourth-year university student,
not opting for grad school, but
diving into the profession where his
prospects seemed good, he was
shamefully brought to his knees
over an act so childishly basic as
whether or not to ‘drink the milk.

It was nearly seven o’clock. He

There’s hardly anywhere a

fall to pieces if he doesn't vote in

November and leaves only after t

putting in a sincere plug for his or

Gow to Massey-
Help Is Wanted

Lest anyone suppose that Senate
President Gerald Massey is abusing
his new office to retaliate against
the School of General Studies
(SGS), let me say that we will
welcome the greater faculty partici-
pation -in SGS affairs which he
mentions in his letter in Friday’s
Pitt News. We have been striving
toward that very end for several
years, with some but not yet nearly
enough success.

There are many ways ‘in which
greater faculty attention—particu-
larly FAS faculty attention—prob-
ably would benefit SGS but I will
suggest only two: ’

1. Although FAS departments are

SGS precisely__as they are for doing
so in CA5, I feel sure SGS gets
disproportionately few regular fac-
ulty and more than its share of
graduate student teachers._ I
acknowledge that the professional
schools which offer undergraduate
majors in SGS, such as the Graduate
School of Business, generally do
better in this regard.

‘ 7. Evening ofﬁce hours by faculty
for SGS evening students are a
rarity in many departments, yet
evening students have quite as
much need for and right to that
beyond-the-classroom faculty func-
tion as to day students, and they pay
the same tuition rate.

While we do have some dedicated
faculty members serving on the SGS
Council, on the SGS Budget Policies

Committee and, incidentally, on the .

‘Committee for the Informal Pro-
gram, I am confident that any
‘further faculty participation in SGS

 

affairs Senate President Massey
can help to generate will lead
toward more equal treatment for
SGS students. This more construc-
tive direction in which Massey has
turned the exchange is most
welcome.

Cops’) Remark

Unsatisfactory

In Friday’s Pitt News there was a
front page article reporting that
three women, at least two of whom
are graduate students at Pitt, were
raped last week in the Oakland area.
In this article, a_ person identiﬁed as

—:_j
“‘a detective with the Pittsburgh

police youth and sex squad” was
reported to have said that
“investigations are continuing”
and to have made, in addition, these
remarks:

“There probably will be one or
two more (rapes in Oakland) before
we can come up with something
definite.”

And, “It works in a series. But it
moves around. One time (police
station) number nine will be busy,
another time it will be number four
(Oakland).”

Ifmd such remarks, or rather, the
attitude reﬂected in them, entirely
unsatisfactory. They seem to reﬂect
the belief that rape, like a viral
infection, or some sort of natural
disaster, is something that merely

‘moves around,’ and so must run its _
course before it can be treated or‘

obliterated. This sort.of view is
unsatisfactory on r two (related)
counts. First: it ignores the fact

that it _isp_eople who rape people. «-

The rape victim is not merely the _ -
victim of a natural disaster. Rapists '  

are persons, not merely inconven-

~iently located natural phenomena.

Second: the remarks that the
detective is quoted as making

reﬂect a passivity that I ﬁnd.‘

alarming. Rather than wait until

there are “one or two more” rapes

in Oakland “before coming up with
anything deﬁnite,’?. or waiting to’
see where “it” moves next;
energies should be spent trying to

insure that is moves nowhere. ’

Energies should be spent trying to

protect the residents, students, and ,

other women of Oakland, trying to

insure that none of them will be the‘

“one or two more.”

I should have thought that an‘

article reporting‘ the rapes of

students in the proximity of Pitt. I
would also report that there was to

be more and better security in the
Pitt area, especially after dark‘. ._I
should have thought that we would

 Rape: Timeto Examine

 

  

 
 

 

Manda?-,-

 



Some of the Issues

BY G. LEE

Rage and horror have driven '

me to speak of a most serious matter
affecting all University of Pitts-
burgh students and, generally,
mankind as well.

In the past week, three Pitt

. women have been sexually abused.
' These tragic crimes, which occurred

on separate occasions, have not only
been sad misfortunes for the ladies
involved, but also have stirred a
number of others. - Boyfriends,
husbands, parents and teachers of

- women, not to mention the women

themselves, have been living in a
most uncomfortable state of anxi-
ety. The question worries all alike,
“Who will be the next victim?”

/' It is time for all of us to examine
some hard issues. While the act of
sexitself connotes pleasure, rape is
not a pleasure, but a grave crime
against ahuman being. Contrary to
historical myths, it is neither
thrilling nor exciting to be raped.
Similarly, most forcible rapes have
not been incited by women
themselves. A rape victim should

. not be.associated With dirt and

shame. What should be associated
with it is the deep emotional upset
that frequently lingers after such an
experience, disturbing a woman for
months. Rarely does a woman
emerge from such an experience

 ’ I without a mark.

' Rape is not the concern of women

- -alone. Rather, it should affect all of
»us, when a fellow human is made to

suffer at the expense of others.
Since we cannot erase the event

once it has occurred, what then can
anyone do in its brutal aftermath?

To begin with, let’s attune
,our:selves to some of the emotional
considerations and problems which
may arise in a rape victim, shortly
after the occurrence. A person who
has been through such an ordeal
might develop reactions or attitudes
which may, in the opinion of others,
seem irrational and unwaranted.
For example, she may distrust
certain encounters on the street,
who might approach with the
innocent question such as, “Ms. do
you know the time?’ In some cases,
a woman might become extremely
fearful, anxious or defensive about
matters which went previously
unattended. Thus, we should be
aware of and sensitive to the
feelings of such women, and not
ridicule their responses.

The next salient issue to which we
must address ourselves, is rape
prevention. It is time to work
together in an effort to protect

A women from this abuse in the near
future. This can be accomplished
by exercising a greater degree of
prudence and caution. Gone are the
days when women can walk down
‘side streets at night, or" Stroll
through the woods of city parks in
the day. Thus, is it too much to ask
"for men to walk women to their ca'r‘s
or bus stops after evening classes?
Women should not be made to feel
,foolish to ask for these extra
precautions, no more than men
should feel that this is unnecessary.

When rape does occur, perhaps
the worst mistake that cn be made is
to let it go unreported. If more

rapists received the penalty that is
their due, fewer rapists would be
eat on the street. Even if only a few
identifying characteristics can be
told to.the police, it would still aid
more than none.

Finally, it might be advantageous
to have more dependable security
on campus. A University of this size
and in this location cannot afford to
go unprotected, from anyone’s
point of view. These three rapes are
not by any means the only rapes that
will ever occur.

Creating a situation where all
eligible voters would actually vote

Don’t Be Surprised At

BY MARK A. SHAW
The recent resignation of Agri-
culture Secretary Earl Butz should
not be surprising to those who
aren’t naive enough to believe our
government does not have racist
fanatics heading its departments.
For those who were surprised, all I
can say is “May God bless you
because you need his blessing.”
Butz resigned last Monday for
what he termed a “gross indis-
cretion” in making a racial slur
against blacks. While talking with
Pat Boone, John Dean and a few
other celebrities on a plane ride last
August, Butz made a ridiculous,
unprintable statement about
blacks.

It is obvious that Butz is a
rednecked- bigot. His remarks
prove that. But even beyond that,

What Happened To Butz

one must question President
Gerald Ford's reaction to the Butz
issue. Ford waited hoping the
media wouldn’t reveal that Butz
made the crude statement which
was attributed to an unnamed
official when it appeared in Rolling
Stone magazine. Ford made no
attempt to ask for Butz’s resign-
ation in order to prevent future
incidents, even after Republican
party members became critical of

~Butz. Maybe Ford believes in what

Butz has said about blacks. I‘ hope
the voters take this into consider-
ation on ,Nov_. 2.

Nevertheless, Earl Butz got what
he deserved for his racist antics.
Don’t be surprised at what

 happened. Just look at it in terms

of seeing a Klu Klux Klan member
(or mentality) stripped of his sheet
for the public to see who he is. '

, Dirty Tricks: No

Place at Pitt

On 'Monday, Oct. 4, there
appeared in your Events calendar, a
notice of a “public hearing” on the
Nyden case to be conducted on
Friday by the FAS Tenure and
Promotions Review Board Panel.
The members of that panel were
amazed to discover this notice,
which, they assert; they did not

- submit and did not authorize, and

they had no plans for such a public
hearing. The Friday edition

contains a simple statement to the
effect that the announcement had
not been placed by any member of
the committee. In fact, the
committee proceeded to hold a
public hearing _ as fraudulently
announced, evidently intimidated
by the fact that the announcement
had been made and would generate
some kind of attendance and
expectations.

The unconscionable trickery of
planting such a false notice reminds

us of Donald Segretti and the creeps '

of the 1972 Committee to Re-elect
the President. . Needless _to say,

such deceit has no more place in a
university than in national politics.
We call upon the Pitt News to go
beyond its simple report of this
fraud, and to take an editorial stand
in condemnation of the party
responsible in this case, and, in
general, of the cynical and immoral

.misuse of its pages for the deceitful I

manipulation of the university

would, in fact, give a substantial
number of people who don’t care
about politics and who are either
unable or unwilling to make a
serious, intelligent choice, a strong
and undeserved hand in politics.

Looking at it from another
perspective, one may point to a
1970 Louis Harris poll which
estimated that 18.5 million adults
16 yéars or older are functionally
illiterate. In other words, they
don’t possess the competency to ﬁll
out a driver's license application.
Another million are totally illiter-
ate, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau. Should they unite, God
forbid, and form a National
Illiterate Coalition, Donald Duck
would indeed be a strong contender
for the presidency, provided that a
duck was drawn on the ballot.

Like it or not, the political game
is relative to Darwin's theory of
natural selection (survivalof the
ﬁttest). The American Constitution
provides an atmosphere where
the voters should have an unlimited
access to information relevant to
their elected officials. The free
press is _a key agent of this process,
allowing the average person to
reach a signiﬁcant
political intelligence by merely
reading a newspaper or listening to
a radio.

It follows that the people
interested in government are
naturally going to rise above the
herds of political illiterates, by

utilizing the information at their '

disposal and eventually come to a
point where they are confident to
express an opinion of the way the

- nation should berun by casting a

vote. Those _masses of political
illiterates, on the other hand, don’t
go to the polls because they do not
feel secure that they have evolved
to a point of sophistication at which
they could cast an intelligent vote.
To try to prod them into voting as
the
Society groups are doing is
unnatural and futile.

If only 55 million people, 38% of
the electorate, go to vote on
Nov. 2, it is for the simple reason
that the other 90 million don’t feel

Project Re-Entry Befriénds Pi-iijsof

BY MAGGIE McKAY p

In many prisons today there is an.
increasing emphasis on prisoner
rehabilitation, on -making the
prisoner ﬁt for “re-entry” into
society. A multitude of vocational
training programs are designed to
help the prisoner ease back into
society as painlessly as possible.

In addition to this, some prisons
provide therapeutic services such as
individual psychological counseling
of prisoners. But some facilities go
beyond individual counseling by
staff psychologists.

The State Regional Correctional
Facility at Greensburg, a minimum
security prison, has begun a
program called Project Re-Entry.
It's purpose is to provide an
effective transition into society for
its prisoners with the aid of
volunteers who will work on a
one-to-one basis with them, provid-
ing friendly, helpful relationships.

Students at Pitt, working in
conjunction with the correctional
facility’s vocational coordinator
John Wersing, are organizing

Project Re-Entry on the Pitt

campus.

“In most . minimum security
facilities the prisoners are from 18
to 25 years of age. They are usually
first offenders and ‘not really

hardened criminals,” Nancy Col-
gan, Pitt YMCA member and
coordinator of Project Re-Entry
said.

“Volunteers will work on a
one-to-one basis with an assigned
resident. We will be trying to
establish a trusting, friendly
relationship. We can be a median,

someone who’s not in the resident’s‘

family and not a probation officer,”
she said.

Volunteers, according to Colgan,
must make a commitment to the
resident for nine months, meeting

with him weekly for three months '

before release and six months after
release on a weekly basis.

“The one thing the people at
Greensburg stress is ‘that as a
volunteer, you are not a psycholo-
gist. You are not a counselor. They
have those people,” Colgan said.
“The resident needs you as an
objective observer, someone to
sound off to.” ‘

The volunteer’ s role, according to
Col gan, also is to link the resident to
agencies and people that could help
get a job or ﬁnish his education.

I Volunteers are trained at the
Greensburg facility in conjunction
with aicounty probation ofﬁcer.

Seminars are held’ on. the first
Saturday of the month and every

These‘-’1nen aren’t being rubbed the wrong way for nothing. The
-residents of the sixth floor of Holland Hall sponsored a massage parlor
for charity last Friday night. One male floor from every dorm was invited
and each male attending was massaged for a $.50 donation. The $31
proﬁt is‘ to be distributed among charities for ﬁve diseases: Cystic
Fibrosis, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation, Blindness and Leukemia.

volunteer is required to attend.

Seminars such as the “Psychology

of a Client,” according to Colgan,-
deal with the problems of building

up a relationship between volunteer
and a resident.

Volunteers in Project Re-Entry
will work closely with Wersing.
Each volunteer must ﬁle biweekly
progress reports to the vocational
coordinator and the resident’s
counselor. Even after the
prisoner’s 1 release, the volunteer
must hand in progress reports to the
institution. _

“It’s initiating institutional con-
tact after release. Most institutions
‘will just release prisoners and
forget about them,” Colgan said.

Both Colgan and Susan Nickels,
the project’s other coordinator, are

S interviewing potential volunteers,

but the ﬁnal judgment is left to
Wersing. _ , y

“We are making sure people
have the time "to commit to the
program. We also have to make
sure they haveino preconceived
notion of what a ‘criminal’ is that
would impede their ability to help
the resident,” Colgan said.

“We have to make sure
volunteers have a stable personal-
ity. Of course, we can’t just ask a
person ‘Are you stable?’ There’s no

Oakland residents would mislead
you to believe.

Ernest Smallis, owner of Chances
R, also owns the Moonraker, a
seafood restaurant in Monroeville
which has its’ ﬁsh ﬂown in fresh
every day from the east coast.

Food is prepared at the
Moonrakerand sent to Chances R_
where it is cooked to order and then
served. Thus the menu consists of
items that can‘ be baked as
casseroles or deep fried on the
premises.

But quality was not lacking in the
hot coquille I sampled. The cream
sherry wine sauce was loaded with
plenty of shrimp, crabmeat and
scallops. One did not have to ‘ ‘ﬁsh”
around the sauce for bits of seafood.
And the scallops were real scallops,

My companion ordered squid

used, not overpowering the delicate

Chances R also serves deep-fried
squid, which is obviously bought
fresh and then breaded. The
breading was ﬂaky and light and

i was not burned and gummed to the

squid like the pre-breaded frozen
style. And the squid inside tasted

The menu reﬂects Smallis’ aim at
the students. All lunch prices run
between $1.25 and $2 and the
dinner entree’s are between $3.50
and $6. Not bad for honest to

project is seeking female as well as

“We’re screening female volun-
teers to see how they’ll feel with
male relationships of this sort,”
Colgan said. “The male volunteers
often are seen as role models, while
female volunteers may meet the
needs of men who have never had
stable relationships.”

Volunteers are required to keep
all information given to them by the
resident conﬁdential. P

“You have to let your resident
know what you can’t handle and
what you don’t want him to tell
you,” Colgan Said- '

But if a resident tells his

volunteer about something which

may endanger the safety of others
or about something which is illegal,
the volunteer has the moral
obligation to tell the authorities,
according to Nickels. ~'

LEADERS ATTACKED

BELFAST, Northern Ireland

(AP)—The two top leaders of the ,

women's peace movement narrow-
ly escaped injury late Sunday from
a club-swinging mob that wrecked
the cars they had been riding in.
Betty Williams, 32-year-old
founder of the movement, and

co-leader, were rushed by the mob '

when they arrived fora meeting at a
community center in a Roman
Catholic district of western Belfast.

Several hundred persons, some

brandishing clubs and sticks, were

waiting outside the hall when the
women drove up in two cars. They
were accompanied by Mrs.

Williams’ husband, a seaman, and_

Ciaran McKeown, a former Dublin
editor now devoting his time to
organizing the peace movement.

The four managed to get safely
inside. A taxi driver who was at the
meeting and had his cab at the back
of the hall later drove them home
safely.

The mob had earlier attacked at

‘S Guilt,

 
   

   

BY TOBI ROSEN
It’s been a while since a Studio
Theatre play has caused an
outrage. The latest production of
The Silver Cord gloriously does so.

The play opens to Mrs. Phelps’
meticulously decorated home.
Warm pinks, crimsons and ma-
roons bombard the livingroom.
Polished brass plates are riveted to
the walls, while the lovely curved
wood adds a smidgen of impene-
trability.

This is the comforting home and
devouring den of Mrs. Phelps and
her grown sons David and Robert.
For years, she has tautly bound
them to her. She “protects” them
from the “other women” in their

. lives.
Christina, David’s new wife, and-

Hester, Robert's ﬁance, become
aware of the process used to
manipulate their bethrothed.
martyrdom and dripping
sweetness blind the men from
“seeing" how their hands are still
cemented to Mama’s apron strings.

Our frustration arises out of
David’s and Robert’s selective
deafness, dumbness and blindness
to the obvious. But they are not to
blame. Or so playwright Sidney
Howard tells us. .

Bl_ame it on Mama, which is a
most tempting proposition. But
they have grown comfortable with
their malady. Too much smother-
ing (or mothering) has robbed them
of the emotional distance crucially
needed to examine the web they
are ‘caught in. They lack the

perception necessary to lead_

autonomous lives. A “loving”
mother has obligated her dutiful
sons to her.

This is how life might have

continued for this Oedipal trio if no-

for Christina. Almost always
dressed in blue, slre"’bffers a“'bit of
fresh air to the Pink Lady. She is a
woman who knows herself and likes
herself. She presents an honest
mind and honest emotions.
Christina is a biologist who isn’t
threatened by her need for David’s
love and affection. Her intelligence
and sensitivity come without

package or pretense.

‘Susan Wright turned in a
sterling portrayal of this heroine.
Wright spanned wide emotional
ground ranging from verbal inter-
rogation to playful loving.

The play’s ‘ other interesting
charactervis Mrs. Phelps. She has
learned the‘ value of a dramatic
glance or timed gesture. As the
braid is entwined around her head.

so are her sons bound to her breast,
ﬁlling the many lonely vessels in
her life.

She employs ‘classic ways of
entrapping her sons’ devotion. The
frail health and failing heart, a
grimace of “motherly” concern are
used to undermine her daughters-
in-law's positions. She’s a
performer in total control of her
vocal and facial facilities: For years
she has played to a “captive”
audience.

Jocelyn Johnson is master of this '
character. Her accurate portrayal
prompted more than one young and
pretty wife to reassess her own
in-law relationship.

The Silver Cord’s direction is as
down pact as Mrs. Phelps’
motherly smile. Henry Heymann
has heightened the drama and
tensions to sizable proportions.‘ He
knows the meaning of a schtick and
how to make it work. His staging

and pacing of the characters is

nearly_ flawless.

Mann's Presley Book
Falls Under His Spell 

BY DEANNA LOUISE
Elvis and The Colonel
May Mann
Pocket Books
$1.95, 294 pages

Elvis Presley whirlwinded the 50s
setting America’s ‘suppressed sex-
uality amuck and female hearts on
ﬁre.

Even today stadium attendants
akin to babysitters changing
diapers ﬁnd odious ﬂoor mopping
and pantie distributing duties
unique to Presley concerts.

Once hysteria sets-in females
swoon, husbands mutter obsceni-
ties and attendants crings. But
everyone’s‘ transﬁxed by Presley,
contorting and swivel-hipping them
into sexual fantasyland.

At the printing of May Mann’s
Elvis and the Colonel, Presley had
50 gold records, set new box-office

records grossing $313,000 a show, '
' which surpassed the one-day record

set the previous year by the Rolling
Stones, been a write-in nominee for

the 1972 presidential election and .

been the creator and Kind of
rocK’n’roll for 20 years, though

many of today’s rocksters scoff at .
that fact, placing the Beatles and .

Stones on a rock_’n’roll pedestal.
Mann was the only reporter ever

authorized by manager Colonel ,

Torn Parker to interview Presley.
She records her confrontations with
the King, the Colonel and people
close to both, with overtones of pure
feminine enchantment.
Mann admits in the book her own

love for Elvis, it’s difﬁcult to say her’

account is objective.
V Mann says, ‘ ‘It _was then that I fell
helplessly in love, on the spot, with
Elvis and with.his talents-.”
Though many of Mann’s state-
ments in the book sound like fuel for
her ‘Hollywood talk columns, she
was one of the few reporters
respected and trusted by the
Presley crew.
Mann’s gossipy inserts tip the
seesaw between a teenybopper

‘infatuation tone and a showing of

her digniﬁed respect for the man
and his accomplishments.

Elvis and the Colonel lavish with
quotes from the King himself goes
beyond the only‘ other published
biography of Presley mentioned by
Mann, Elvis by Jerry Hopkins,
because of the personal perceptions
and closeness of author to subject.

To her discredit, Mann does skip
the cultural and indepth childhood
background that Hopkins scroun-
ged. Without objective speciﬁcs of
his childhood, Mann cannot present

a story that explains as well as.

justiﬁes his reign over women.
Whoever said fairy tales don’t
come true can eat their words.
Presley was born dirt poor in dire
conditions in a one room Tupelo,
Miss. shack. And his rise to
stardom and riches, though his
aspirations were never that high, is
more of a miracle in light of the
social and economic straits of the
post World War II South which

_Mann neglected to mention.

Her’ exclusive interviews ,with
Presley, like her past exclusives;
with Clark Gable, were the basis“

probably because they are the only
people willing to talk openly about

Presley. His staff and the Colonel
are diehard faithfuls to his wish for‘
privacy.

In fact, often the fans were too
willing to talk and caused unprec-

 Victorious Pitt Loses

Pitt quarterback Matt Cavanaugh, shown after scoring the Panthers’
first touchdown Saturday versus Louisville scored twice on keepers and
directed Pitt to a 27-0 lead before fracturing his ankle in the second

quarter.

BY STEVE SYDERT
Sports Editor

Where have all the quarterbacks"

gone?

Only four short weeks ago, the
Pitt Panthers, the nation's number-
two ranked college football team,
possessed possibly the best one-
two quarterbacking combination in
the country. But now that duo is
dissolved--a torn knee ligament to
starter Robert Haygood and" a
fractured ankle to replacement
Matt Cavanaugh within a month
has placed the Panthers again in a
touchy situation.

After losing Haygood against
Georgia Tech, the burden of
running Pitt's /offense went to
Cavanaugh, who did superbly in
his second start of the season last
week against Duke. But in the
Panthers’ 27-6 conquest of the
Louisville Cardinals Saturday at
Pitt Stadium before 20,000 plus
raindrenched fans; Cavanaugh too
fell to an injury.

With 4:22 left in the ﬁrst h_alf an_d
Pitt leading 27-0, Cavanaugh rolled
to his right and kept-the ball for five
yards and ﬁrst down. But a
Louisville tackler fell on Cavan-
augh’s ankle and sudden hush

came over the crowd at as it
appeared still another quarterback
was about to be scratched off the
Pitt depth. chart.

Cavanaugh was wheeled to the

 Pitt locker room where x-rays of the

damage were taken.” According to

 team physician, Dr. James Mc-

Master, Cavanaugh sustained a
hairline fracture of the left ﬁbula
(the top of the ankle) and will be
out for three or four weeks.

Cavanaugh, however, maintains he

V will be back sooner if possible.

It was a day that you might
expect an occurrence like that to
happen. A steady rain all morning
thoroughly soaked the field making
footing on the artificial turf
hazardous and the players, who
slipped and slid through the
puddles, more prone to an injury.

Dave Migliore, a senior with
little experience, replaced Cavan-
augh and was replaced himself by
another senior, Tom Yewcic, after
failing to generate any sort of
offensive drive; Yewcic, pressed
into action in the emergency
situation, looked shaky as did the
entire offense at that point. A

The timing on_ the option just
wasn’t there and the snaps from
center (John Pelusi, with a bruised
knee, was replaced by two
inexperienced centers) were not
connecting either. The result was a
very shoddy second half for the
Panthers, who failed to score in
that span.

“Having two quarterbacks out in
the second half against a very
tough opponent would have been a
very difﬁcult game to have won,
under the conditions of the weather
and the ﬁeld and no experience at
the quarterback position,” said a
worried coach Johnny Majors.

‘‘I’m glad to be 5-0 at this stage

  Women ’s Weekend Busy

BY PATTY TASCA_RELLA

If sticks and stones can break
your bones—what will a rock do? If
the rock in question is the Slippery
Rock women’s ‘ﬁeld hockey team,
you might come back with bones
intact but another bigslash in the‘
loss column.

Which is exactly what happened
to the Pantherettes; the Rockettes
slammed Pitt .6-1 Friday afternoon
at Slippery Rock’s home ﬁeld.

The Rockettes led 3-0 at the half.
Pitt left inner Cindy DiGiacomo got

the lone goal at the beginning of the
ﬁnal period, assisted by Sue Swick.
Slippery Rock took over again,
scoring three more goals to bring
the ﬁnal score to 6-1. ‘

Slippery Rock and Indiana (which
shut out Pitt 10-0) both utilize
system play as opposed to Pitt’s
traditional. System play has a four
forward line, two links, three
thrusts, a sweeper and a goalie
while traditional runs a ﬁve fofward
line, three halfbacks, two fullbacks
_and aﬂgoalie.

While traditional play is the basic
step for ﬁeld hockey players,
especially a ﬂedgling team like the
Pantherettes, system provides
greater mobility——-instead of stay-

. ing in a general area, the team shifts

with the ball. It is obvious that other
squads using system can dominate
Pitt in games, but the Pantherettes
need more experience before they
can utilize system.

“The game showed very much
improvement, more than I expected

When the Panthers lost starting quarterback Robert Haygood in their

' second game of the season, Matt Cavanaugh was deemed a very capable
replacement. But now Cavanaugh has been injured and the Pitt
quarterbacking situation has once again been thrown into turmoil. A
freshman, Woody Jackson, was slightly injured in Friday’s JV game,
but will be counted on, along with senior Tom Yewcic, to lead the
Panthers for the next several weeks. Sie gel photo

WANTED: QUARTERBACKS,
Experience preferred but not
necessary. Must be willin2 to
travel. Health insurance recom-
mended. Apply in person, Pitt
Stadium.

Things aren’t really that des-
perate, but what was at the start of
the season Pitt’s strongest point
besides Tony Dorsett may turn out
to be its Achilles’ Heel.-

Throughout the preseason, about
the only position hotly contested
was quarterback. It was a pleasant
feeling for Johnny Majors: Both
Robert Haygood and Matt Cava-
naugh were experienced and
everybody knew either could do the
job well. /

Behind them? Well shucks,
Johnny Majors tells you, “Very few

‘ teams have two good quarterbacks.

You get the third...”

Into the third is where the
Panthers are, some even say into
the fourth. In Pitt-’s 42-14 win at
Georgia Tech, Haygood’s leg was
exposed after a short gain, and
when a Yellow Jacket landed on it,
snap went the 'ligaments.,
Haygood’s season ended in his
home state.

Injuries Thro w Quarterbacks For Loss

There was no cause for alarm,
though. In came Cavanaugh, and
outside of a, few more passing
plays, nobody could tell the
difference. Certainly not by the
game scores, which remained
‘impressive. . ,

“God bless Matt Cavanaugh,”
Dorsett said at the time. “I don’t
know what we'd do if he got hurt.”

Well, it’s'time to start wondering
and worrying. Cavanaugh had

given the Panthers a 27-0 lead over.

Louisville Saturday when his leg
also was exposed after a ﬁve-yard
gain. It didn't quite snap, but Matt
will be watching from the sidelines
when Pitt hosts one of the great
“upset schools” around, Miami of
Florida, this Saturday at‘ Pitt.
Stadium.

Cavanaugh suffered a hairline
fracture of his left ﬁbula. The leg
will be wrapped, and he will use
crutches for a while. It will not be
placed in a cast. Team doctorssay
he could be back in three to four
weeks. Cavanaugh thinks he could
be ready in two.

Cavanaugh isllucky. Broken
fiblulas average four months in a

Majors is hoping that he can come
up with a suitable replacement
who, coupled with Pitt’s awesome
defense and punting game, will
allow' the Panthers to remain
undefeated.

Freshman Woody Jackson, a 6-0,
175-pounder from Spotslvania, Va.,
is considered by many to be Pitt’s
third best quarterback. He
suffered a bruised shoulder in the
Pitt junior varsity’s 27-7 win over
Potomac .State Friday. Jackson
could be ready for Miami, but it’s
too soon to tell, and he has yet to
throw a pass in a varsity game
anyhow. _

When Jackson was injured
Friday, his replacement was Tom

Yewcic, a 5-11 senior (with another .

year of eligibility left) walk on from
Conemaugh, Pa. Yewcic waswfour
for six in that game, connecting for
145 yards and two touchdowns.
Yewcic played the entire second
half against Louisville. «He quickly
discovered that the Cardinals did
not resemble Potomac state.

Coupled with a wet ball, a wet ﬁeld ‘

and a_ new center, things didn’t go
well for Pitt that second half. The
offense virtually shut down.
Dorsett, who rushed for 109
yards in the first half, got just 21.
Yewcic completed one of ﬁve
passes, and had one intercepted for
what would have been a touchdown
but for a Louisville clipping
penalty. He repeatedly had trouble
taking snaps from /center John
Takacs, who started in place of
John Pelusi. .- .. atfalned knee,
could have played if really needed,
according to Majors. His status for
next week is not clear at this time.
Yewcic, playing in his second

game in as many days, had a‘

bruised shoulder which he didn’t
tell anyone about until after the
game. '

Also seeing action at quarterback
was Dave Migliore, a 5-11 senior
from Dover, Ohio. He played one
set of downs. “Migliore didn’t get
much done,” said_Majors, “so I

‘thought I’d' try something else.

There couldn’t have been a worse
time to call on somebody new.”
The’ only other quarterbacks on

‘the Pitt roster are 6-5 Wayne

Adams, a sophomore, from Eliza-
beth, Pa., and 5-11 freshman
Randy Bentley from Jersey City.

Early speculation is as follows:
Look for Jackson to start if he's
healthy. If not, Yewcic, with a
game of experience, a hard week of
practice and, hopefully, a _ dry
football, will get thecall and will be
much improved. '

“As I get used to the speed of
the first team in practice,” said
Yewcic, ‘‘I can only improve.”

Outside of Friday’s JV game and
a similar game last year, Yewcic
hadn't played as much football as
he did Saturday since high school.
His understandable inexperience
boggled down the Pitt running
game as much as Louisville tacklers
did. .
_ It makes for an exciting week.
Pitt’s top two quarterbacks are out
for sure, and the inexperienced
Yewcic and Jackson both have
minor injuries. It's enough tomake
a coach take out a want ad.

McDowell said. “We had to make
some changes and both of my
fullbacks (Denise Harsen and Kris
Fairbanks) are inexperienced.

“Cindy has picked up the game-»

verynicely,” she continued. “She

McDowell praised goalie Robin

“I feel Janet, if she could have

said. ‘ .
Otherwise, Gordon was more

Fred Jacobs contributed 31 yards on

but also the punting game, from
which Louisville gained its only
touchdown after blocking a Larry
Swider punt with 2:30 elapsed in
the ﬁnal period. Mark Pongonis
batted down the kick and Tom
Abood recovered in the end zone to
break the shutout, the second such
mistake plaguing Pitt in two weeks.
The extra point try was no good.

“I’m very concerned about

' getting that punt blocked,” Majors

said. ‘‘I’m very concerned about
us not taking the slack up
offensively and making more
yardage on Louisville inside when
we needed it. But our defense was
just great. That’s two shutouts our
defense should have had except for
the punting game. That’s
something I’m very disturbed
about.

“I’m‘very proud of our de-

proud of our victory. I thought
there was a great amount of
courage shown by the team
wearing the red and white out there
too and the way they played us with
far overwhelming odds and I'm
proud of the way our defense
played when we had our backs to
the wall.

“I'm very happy we won, but
we've got work to do between now
and our next opponent. I feel very
strongly that Miami quite likely will
be the toughest team we've played
