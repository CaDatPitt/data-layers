Gov't. Studies Weigh Need for Change

by JOHN CAPITMAN
Dr. Joseph James and Chris-

"‘_‘7tine Altenberger, both staff mem-

bers in the Institute for Urban
Policy and Administration, at
the University, were elected
last fall to serve on Government
Study Commissions, made possi-
ble by Pennsylvania Act No. 62
which “permits local government
to revise their form of govern-
ment.”

But according to James, who is
on the Allegheny County Commis-

sion, “Just because the referen-~

dum allowing governmental
studies passed two to one, doesn’t
mean that people want change, it
only means that people are inter-
ested in seeing what other options
are open to them.”

Altenberger, a member of the
Penn Hills Commission, explain-
ed that “we may even find out
that the majority of the responses
say that the municipality's gov-
ernment is sufficient, in which
case our proposal will be to leave
things as they are.

“Our/task is to study the pre-
sent government and decide

whether or not a change in form
and structure of the municipality
is needed—we hope to get . . . a
good sense‘ of what people want.”

James, who sees the purpose
of the Government Study Commis-
sion in similar terms, explained
this need for a consensus by say-
ing, “You got to be aware of the
fact that whatever recommenda-
tions we make, it has to be voted
upon by the citizens of the"county,
thats a hurtle we’ve got to be pre-
pared to overcome.”

‘ Both James and Altenberger ex-
plained the procedure that their
commissions will follow, while

u

trying to arrive at a decision for

“a possible revision of local gov-
ernment,” which will include
careful study of other areas
across the country with similar
populations anti. problems, and
meetings with county and muni-
ipal officials, special organiza-
tions, and private citizens.

The county commission, which
has begun to schedule public
hearings would, according to
James, “Certainly encourage stu-
dents to appear and testify about

Task Force Suggests  
{Student Veteran Grants

HARRISBURG (AP)-—A House
task force recommended that the
state provide direct grants of $50
per month to veterans attending
school under the GI Bill.

The 11-member panel, which
held hearings in four cities last
year on benefits available to re-
turning servicemen, concluded
that federal aid to veterans is in-
sufficient for most who wish to
continue their education.

The chairman of the task force,
Rep. William J._ Lederer, D.-Phil-
adelphia, said: ..

“It is a sad commentary when

only '29 per cent of all eligible .

Pennsylvania veterans utilize
benefits under the GI Bill of
Rights, the principal reason be-

. ing the economic hardship en-

countered by so many veterans."

The group’cited Veterans Ad-
ministration figures showing 373.-
000 Vietnam veterans living'in
Pennsylvania. But only 108,000,
according to the VA, got federal
aid for more education.

“The veteran finds it virtually
impossible to ' sustain himself
with the money he receives from
the federal government through
the school year," the task force
reported. -I '

A Achievements And Goals

\

by ROB OBENREDER

Dr. Alfred Moye, Dean of Stu-.

dent Affairs, addressed the Uni-
versity Board of Trustees Wed-
nesday afternoon concerning his
goals and achievements in the Of-
fice of Student Affairs during the
past year.

Moye said, “My objective-'was
to operate an office which would
be sensitive to the needs of stu-
dents . . . to improve the quality
of education and the climate and
quality of campus life.”

Concerning the student activ-
vities fee, approved by the stu-
dents in a recent referendum,
Moye said, “We prepared a set of
guidelines for expenditure of ac-
tivity fee monies and initiated a
mandatory one day program for
officers‘ of student organizations
receiving activity fee monies . . .
establishing procedures for sound
fiscal management.

“We have developed a compre-
hensive orientation p r o g r a m

their feelings toward present and
future local government.”

“The commission has very spe-
cific issues which it will be con-
tinually asking for their infor-
mants perceptions of, like the
governments responsiveness to
citizen needs, adequacy in the de-
livery of services, and general-
ly fufilling peoples expectations,”
according to.Alternberger.

The Penn Hills study will also
include a survey opinion poll

(Continued from Page 2)

which focuses on the academic
functions of the University. A
credit course . . . presently being
taught by Dr. Jonathan Harris, is
designed to offer students a com-
plete review of educational theory
and philosophy and a look at Uni-
versity governance and structure
in order to enable them to be more
effective in their work with new
students.” '

“We are attempting to expand
opportunities for summer em-
ployment, internships, and work-
shops for our students in local,
state, and national governments.
I will visit government offices . . .
to solicit support from politicians

,for,pr'ograms which have operat-
. ed for years at a few more presti-

gious institutions, but have been
denied students at a majority of
colleges.”

After the address, Board Chair-
man William H. Rea asked Moye
if there were still any problems
with the food service. Moye re-

plied, “If I said there were no i

problems I would be drummed out
of the University, but we’re work-
ing on them.”

Chancellor Posvar addressed
the Board, calling for “parity in
both academic and athletic areas
of the I University, like Penn
State.” He mentioned the appro-
priation of additional scholarship
funds to attract exceptionalxstu-'
dents to Pitt. “Quality lies at the
heart of every effort we exert,"
he said.

The Chancellor also praised the
outgoing student officials, saying,
“This year‘s Student Government
leadership has been outstanding.”

Chairman of the Student Affairs
Committee of the Board of Trus-

tees, the Hon. Judge Ruggero J.i 

Aldisert, described the reports of
various Student Government of-
ficials at the committee’s last

meeting. Aldisert also mentioned —

Terry Sadler’s emphasis on the
importance of more social‘facil-
ities on campus, and a report by
Dennis Dewey, member of Gen-
eral Studies Cabinet, on the for-
mation of a permanent General
Studies office in the Cathedral,
manned by a full time representa-
tive.

In the report of the Health Pro-,
fessions Committee, Vice-Chair-
man George Stenson stated the
committee was pleased with

Western Psych’s improvements '

in clinical services and praised
their efforts in training and re-
search. “

Stenson also said the Dental
School has been accredited with

reservations by the Dental Coun- *

cil because of a lack of faculty in
clinical areas, and that these de-;
ficiences were being corrected.

The Academic Affairs Commit-
tee, report, given by Chairman C.

Holmes Wolfe, Jr., announced the _ ‘

formation of a University Center 1 =

for Urban Research which would
provide for an inter-school study
of urban problems among the area
colleges.

The Financial Development
Committee reported alumni don-
ations for the year were $273,-
000. Though 1,00 new donors
were realized, contributions had
not increased.

The Investment Committee re- .
ports showed investments. at $94‘
million, up $1 million from last
year. ’ 7

Holds Special Meeting

The Student Government Elections Committee (SGEC) met in a
emergency meeting Wednesday night to discuss certain aspects of the

election code.

SGEC originally declared formal business meetings of the frater- ’

nities and sororities off-limits to Student Government candidates ”in
answer to questions raised about the fairness of last years elections,”
according to Barb Jennings, SGEC chairman.

Making a provision that the candidates could visit the fraternitv ,
and sorority houses on three nights other than the business meetings
on Monday, the Elections Committee assumed agreement by the ‘
Greeks when in fact the fraternities were not in agreement.

Members of the Inter—Fraternity Council “complained to the com-

mittee about the fairness of the ruling,” Jennings said.

The Elections Committee decided to rescind the ban of Monda

Greek business meetings.

9   Lord Presents Musical Offering

by ANDREW J. SOPKO

While Mozart felt that the mu-
sic of J. S; Bach had something
new‘) to offer to the listener upon
each additional hearing, some
Bach recitals unfortunately have
not reaped the same auditory re-
wards. The fault in such instances
lies not with the music but with
the way the music is program-
med. Such was the case with the
all Bach recital given by R. S.
Lord upon the Heinz Chapel organ

this past week. The music was in- '

deed present; a properly conceiv-
ed program was not.

Overladen with all six Shuebler
Organ Preludes, three-quarters
of the program explored the
chorale prelude to the utmost.
And as much as I enjoy Bach, all
six chorale preludes left this lis-
tener almost too saturated to ap-
preciate the other work on the
program, the Fantasia and Fugue
in gminor. '

Since almost all of these pre-
ludes are adaptations of church
cantatas, the melodies are more

than familiar. Hearing one or two ‘

of them can be a most enjoyable
experience; hearing all six can
be a less than exhilirating exper-
ience.

/

While we do not mean to sug-
gest that all Bach sounds the
same, we can indeed say that the
mood cast by each of these half
dozen. works is relatively the
same. These works are hardly

overbearing, but they can certain-
ly tax the listener's concentration
span.‘ *

Nonetheless. two of the pre-
ludes were especially well done.

Shakespearean Attempt

By JOHN METCALFE

This would have been a brief
review of the Oxford And Cam-
bridge Shakespeare Company’s
presentation of “As You Like It”,
at the Syria Mosque, presented
by the Student Union Board -—
Committee On The Arts (COTA).

It would have been brief, be-
cause the event is over; there is
little point in praising or recom-
mending something no one has
a chance of seeing for another
year anyway.

However, this will be neither
a review nor brief.

We attended the matinee.
Those who shared this misfortune
need read no further. They know
how disappointingit all was.

I must mention that the com-
pany appeared to do an excellent
job. Though they probably ex-
pected to be heard, they came
across well in pantomime.

The~play was mounted to take

full advantage of the large deep
stage. Grips, dressed in the same
period as the principals, worked
in neat synchronization to shift
the simple drops used to set
scenes. Entrances and exits were
fully visible, and served to fo-
cus attention onthe central sec-
tion used for all the action of the
play.
. I did not like the use of actors
to shift the furniture within sets,
but that may be a matter of taste.
I cannot believe Mr. Shakespeare
meant for us to ever lose our
view of the actors as characters,
involved in magic, and not just
folks. C

Predictably, the curious acous-
tics of the Mosque and the am-
azing sound system_, fed by a sin-
gle microphone located dead cen-
ter among the footlights, conspir-
ed to make all dialogue nearly
vanish. ~

The job was finished by the
audience.

I assume that COTA was re-
sponsible for the promotion of
this cultural event. Advertising
on campus was minimal; many
students may be hearing about
the‘ presentation for the first
time here. No "matter. Every
High School English teacher in
Western Pennsylvania must have
heard about it.

The strategy worked. Bigelow
Boulevard was full of big yellow
buses, and the house was nearly
sold-out.

There was no apparent super-
vision, but many of the infants
present were in uniform dresses,

in the case of girls; an astonish— .

ing number of boys were wear-
ing neckties. They must have
been from good, or at least ~ex-
pensive schools. " ‘

They were there, and they had
tickets, and they occupied seats,
but they were not an audience.

The play started late, due to
horseplay in the lobby. The first
scene was drowned out by scuff-ling
noises. Some of the second
scene would be heard, and it
sounded very good. Then bore-
dom set in. Giggling, shuffling,
conversation and coughing dom-
inated;

At two points, those present
paid attention: a fight at the very
beginning, and a wrestling match.
later. They were inclined to
shout and whistle (an expression
of disfavor to European troupes),
but they looked.

No more detail. COTA adver-
tised this play within the Univer-
sity as a University Cultural
Event. They also invited a zoo.
I hope they made a lot of money.

I have seen the Oxford "and
Cambridge Shakespeare Company.
Someday I hope to hear them.
They are probably great.

Elections Committee Meets

(Continued from Page 1)

' Jennings explained, “We should have taken into_ consideration the
feelings of the fraternities. No one ever wanted to restrict the fraterni-
t1es—only to make it fair to all candidates.

“We decided the committee really had no jurisdiction to do this and

no way of enforcing it.”

The committee also discussed a loan which David Bluey, one of the
presidential candidates, said he received from follow candidate Rege
Kauffman. The loan had been interpreted by some as a bribe. To dis-
prove the allegations, Bluey returned the loan.

The committee ruled that the exchange was an “untimely transac-
tion between friends” and took no action the matter.

Several students were disgruntled with the committee’s decision
and are circulating a petition to have it reconsidered.-

Kinks Release-‘One of Best’

By BARB GERAUD
The Kink’s new album Every-
body's in Show Biz; Everybody’s
a Star (RCA VPS-6065) has
been out for over three.months,

but it’s taken awhile for your-

intrepid music freak to decide
whether she was prejudiced to-
wards Ray Davies and Co. be-

cause Ray has a beautiful body

or because this is simply ‘one of
the best albums put out in re-
cent memory:

I never was much of a Kinks-
freak. I mean, I liked their sin-
gles, and I loved “Lola”, but I
never bought an album until the
Lola one. I wasn’t overly im-
pressed—it was a good album, but
not a great one . . . . . so I ig-
nored Kronikles and Muswell
Hillbillies when they came out.

Then I saw them in concert,
everything was changed.
Davies has to be the consummate

_' showman. Sure, the audience was
“filled with Kink-maniacs (every-

body screaming “God save the
Kinks!” after every song), but
that show was just about the
tightest, most professional and
entertaining show I ever attend-
ed (and that includes everyone
from the Who to the Stones to
CSN&Y). ‘

So I went out and got, the
Greatest'Hits album (they’re al-
ways nice ones to start out a col-
lection “with). .And_ I got the
Live Kinks, which is an old Re-
prise l.p. that you can’t hardly
find no-more—-recorded in the
days when people went to Kink’s
concerts to watch Ray falldown
drunk, which he did a lot.

I couldn’t find Percy, or Ar-

thur, or Village Green Preserva-'

tion Society, so I settled for
Muswell and Kronikles, all the
while digging through old Roll-
ing Stones and Crawdaddys, try-
ing to find out more about this
massive enigma, Ray Davies.

But that‘-.was impossible. He

would write about going off to a‘

is definitely Kinks——sounding cur-

 Student Government

Tom Bailey

- Student Government should ex-
ist mainlyefor the benefit of the
A students it governs. I am now un-
der the impression that if Student
Government works as -an advi-

f.'_-_ = sary of the administration all pro-

2‘..

cesses of change slow down. Sure
we can push wanted changes down
administrative throats, but they

' are also people and people wheth-

er 20-40-60 demand and deserve
respect. I say, if we are rational
and show the respect that we

' ' ,want, to faculty and staff, changes

occur faster and easier.

_»The‘ term student power is’ not

’ far_sicle, it is true entity which
‘ must be reconned with. This term
the student activities fee was
"legitimized for the first time in
the history of the school, by a vote
of nine to one, with more students
voting than any other referendum
or election. Over 200 thousand

' - dents by students. Think about it!

_  "Howie Eichenbaum

_While obtaining signatures for

 my petition, I was hit with many

/junexpected views and queries ,
' about the Student Government

 ' Board \(SGB). The most common

‘one was “What does the Student

t ' Government (SG) at Pitt do? Is it

a farce or what?” I was really

 5, surprised but then thought about

" it for a while. Of course, they

didn’t know about SG; how could
they? '

I've discovered that the only

,' I way to find out about it is to devel-
 op an interest in it. This shouldn't

be, the case! These questions
"should never come up. The stu-

. dents at Pitt should know what’s
‘ going on in SG. This could be done

by a special bi-monthly flyer put
out like the Pitt News.

In addition, I feel it is the SGB
duty to oversee actions of its com-

,'_~mittees—not take action on de-

 f mands and requests not related

-»\to its purpose. In closing, the stu-

 dentbody at Pitt must realize that

the \SG and SGB are here for its

 J welfare'and that it can find solu-

' " tions to major university prob-

" lems with them. Perhaps in the

 A past it hasn’t. In the future-—it
’ will!. «

Mike Furick

Student government, by its very
definition, should be government
by the students. How many times
in the past year have you govern-
ed? If you’re a typical Pitt stu-
dent the opportunities to voice
your opinion are few and far be-
tween. I think that Pitt’s Student
Government has spent enough
time on the third floor of the‘ Stu-
dent Union. It’s about time the
Student Government asks for the
opinion of the student body and
not simply declares that the stu-
dents are apathetic and wouldn’t
care anyhow. (For example: How
many times in the past year have
webeen asked who we’d like to
see in concert?)

If elected to the board I would
like to give the studentsga bigger
voice in campus affairs. Can ev-
eryone’s opinion be effectively
represented by only six students?
Shouldn’t the Student Government
Board be made up of more peo-
ple? Through my involvement in
the mentor program, freshman
fall weekend, and the fraternity
system, I feel that I am kept in
contact with the feelings of the
students. If you vote next week
please consider me. However, the
important thing is that you vote;
let’s show that Pitt students’ real-
ly do care.

Bob Heister

As a sophomore commuter, ma-
joring in writing and communica-
tions, I write for the Magic Bus,
and I am chairman of the Carpool
Committee of the Commuter As-
sociation. I am a member of the
Student Union Task Force, which
was instrumental in getting a
a commitment from the Chancel-
lor for a new Union. As an active
member of the Student‘ Union
Board, Homecoming, Men’s
Council, the Activities Fair, the
Orientation Committee, and
Freshman Camp, I feel I, have
familiarized myself with func-
tions of Student Government.

If elected I will concentrate,
but not limit, my efforts in two
main areas--an Office of Com-
muter Affairs and the planning
board for the new Student Union.

A Commuter Affairs Office will
give commuters a voice in the ad-
ministration that they never had
before. I

As the only commuter on the
Student Union Committee, I feel
I could lend valuable first-hand
information as to the needs of the
commuter. I would like to see a
Student Union designed with the
student in mind, not academic de-
partments.

Mark Lesnick

Since coming to this University

two and a half years ago, my in-.

terests have expanded greatly
and feel I have become more open
minded. '

As a member of the Student
Rights and Responsibilities Com-
mittee, I help to revise the Stu-
dent Conduct Code. I am a brother
of Alpha Phi Omega, a service
fraternity, a mentor, and a broth-
er of Pi Kappa Alpha.

As a member of the board I
would want more students involv-
ed in University decisions relating
to academics and administration.
For commuters and dorm stu-
dents alike I would like to see bet-
ter relations with the Oakland
community. 0

Student Government has taken
a new look in the past year. I want
the opportunity to work for the

students and with the students, _

for a progressive governing body.
I hope you’ll give me that oppor-
tunity. Thank you.

Larry Manoff

There can be more of a social
life at Pitt than movies. I’d like
to see more dance concerts in the
Towers lobby and cafeteria, for
example. Also, I see no reason
why, after hours, the Towers cafe-

terias can’t be opened and used as _

places where students can go and
socialize. There’s a lot more to
Pitt than the social life, though,

Many of the advisors, especial-
ly those for freshmen and sopho-
mores, are really poor. They
should be trained better or re-
placed. The financial aid process
is extremely beauracratic and
should be simplified. The fac-
ulty review should be more com-
prehensive and shouldn’t carry
only the more favorable reviews. ‘

I’d like to see a system worked

out where if a lot of kids are clos- .

ed out of a course, another section

- is opened for them. Why is there

so much drop-adding? In addition
to opposing a fee for drop-adding,
I suggest a study to find out why
it’s so common. I feel, that if
elected, I can serve the school
efficiently in these and other ca-
pacities. I have previously serv-
ed the Legal Awareness Commit-
tee and WPGH radio. Vote num-
ber one on the ballot.

Jim Mershi

There has always been a prob-
lem with the programming of en-
tertainment at Pitt. We should 1)
intiate a central entertainment
programming committee; 2) es-
tablish a separate programming
allocation; 3) block-book bands
and speakers through the Nation-
al Entertainment Conference.
This will revive the Friday eve-
ning dances and bring in big—name
concerts at a lower cost than the
present system.

I believe more communication
is necessary between Student
Government and the average stu-
dent. A short bi-monthly SG
Newsletter or a special SG sec-
tion in the Pitt News (bi-monthly)
would bring about a greater un-

derstanding of the SG Board’s

functions and decisions.

I will work for and support
measures which will: bring about
more,.on-campus parking; change
the on-campus two hour parking
meters to four hour meters; se-
cure a second’ campus bus for
peak-hour travel.

I am looking forward to ex-
panding the present Pitt Coffee
House. and establishing a “Rats-
keller” on campus. «

I feel there is a need for greater
security in the dorms, especially
over extended vacations. I am en-

‘ thusiastic about working ‘with the

MDC and. WHB and am deeply
concerned with the dorm food sit-
uation and other dorm problems.

Sally O’Leary A

A lack_of communication exists
between the ‘administration and
the students. Pitt students need a
continual dialogue with the Uni-
versity administration regarding
academic standards, however, a
greater voice from students and
closer work with the administra-
tion is needed to bring to the at-
tention of the administration the
social needs of the students.

The University is a city cam-
pus, therefore, social activities
tend to blend into city events. But
facilities to meet the social needs
of the students need supplemented
greatly. '

The University system lacks a
social-intellectual environment
which is needed as an outlet for
the pressures of everday school

work. We need a place where stu-
dents can informally get together.
(ex. Bimbos turned into a func-
tional student night spot.)

Working on these problems and
getting the students concerned
with other aspects of University
life would be a great accomplish-
ment.

The greviances concerning the
Student Government should now
be applied to bettering the future
Student Government system.

Michael Poloyac

The Student Government as ex-
ists has potential to be a dynamic
force for the student. To accom-
plish this, the government must
become credible and visible to the
student body. I feel that if elected
I can help to achieve this hopeful-
ly initiate programs for the good
of the student community.

Various goals are always men-
tioned but a few key goals are as
follows: Hopefully, the format of
the bookstore could be changed
into a cooperative, eliminating
profits on text books; more social
activities should be initiated and
brought to the campus; the gov-
ernment should seek to get the
student a financial break on so-
cial and service costs; and finally
the government should be avail-
able to and function of the stu-
dents.

If elected, I feel I can help the
board to obtain these ends and
make the government meaninful
and efficient. -

Sam Rosenzweig

Students at a.state—related un-
iversity such as Pitt have long
been aware of the impact that
state government has had on the
costs of their education. Yet Stu-
dent Government at Pitt has fail-
ed to give adequate attention to
dollars-and-cents concerns like
tuition increases, PHEAA grants,
and skyrocketing dormitory costs.

In addition to performing the
standard duties of a Student Gov-
ernment Board member, I would
work to initiate a student lobby,
beginning at Pitt and expanding
to other state schools. This stu-
dent lobby would focus attention
on government action affecting
the costs of college education,
scholarships and loans, and dor-
mitory and apartment living.

I would like to organize a few
programs, including an Office of
Commuter Affairs, a renter’s
insurance against property loss
for dorm residents, and an end to
bookstore profits on required
texts. In place of inflated prom-
ises, these programs will help
provide some realistic change.

M. Susan? Riuffnerl

‘The position of Student Govern-
ment Board member requires a
person with diverse experiences.
From the problems of housing to
those of higher education, I have
been involved in various commit-
tees which have given me the op-
portunity to work with students
and administrators on such prob-
lems within the University.

Through the Student Affairs Ad-
visory Council to the Chancellor
(SAAC), I was able to keep well
informed of the issues facing var-
ious student groups. SAAC, which
is composed of presidents of sev-
eral student organizations, gave
me the chance to view issues
from the perspective of those di-

rectly involved. From SAAC I was‘

appointed to the Judicial Board
Selection Committee and elected
to a student advisory board which
meets with the Commissioner of
Higher Education of Pennsyl-
vania.

These perspectives, along with
my experience as president of a
major undergraduate women’s
organization, have given me in-
sights into student affairs which
will permit me to be an effective
Board member.

Chris Schnatterly

The challenge of a Student Gov-
ernment position is being deci-
sive, bold, and responsive to the
students and the University com-
munity. Representing the stu-
dents with creative ideas, vitality,
and‘ thorough accomplishments
are the assets I can offer.

My association with the Phi Eta
Sigma honorary as treasurer and
program chairman, the Men’s
Dorm Council, and thelFood Serv-
ice Committee, has provided me
with the essential knowledge and
experience for leadership.

I cannot help but to better com-
munication between the Student
Government and the student body
because of my openness and will-
ingness to understand and active-

ly respond on all University is-_

sues. A re-evaluation of the exist-
ing student organizations must
not be elued, and keeping the
same, a re-evaluation of alloca-
tions monies is a must. Also pro-
curement of additional funds
should be attained by accessing
Pitt’s student majority, the grad-
uate students, for their use of un-
dergrad services. These ideas
and working vigorously to see
them accomplished will succeed
to make a strong, open, and hon-
est SG..

A Matt Schneirov

As a member of the Students
for Progressive Action slate, I
feel Student Government should
deal more energetically with 10-
cal and national issues. Racism
and sexism in the curriculum, the
war in Viet Nam, the student mur-
ders in Louisiana, and Nixon’s
“end of permissiveness” are is-
sues which we can’t afford to ig-
nore.

We need a Student Government
which will serve as a tool for the
student body to organize for
meaningful change—-not an ad-
ministration mouthpiece. Fight-
ing a possible tuition increase, de-
maning better food in the dorms,
lower prices at the bookstore,
and investigating racism and sex-
ism in the curriculum all require
united student action to achieve
any success.

We in SPA hope to provide a ve-
hicle for the united student action.
As an active member of SDS, an
organization which has fought tui-
tion increases, racism in the cur-
riculum and University compli-
city in the war, I feel qualified in
working for progressive change
on the Student Government Board.

Jeffrey Seifried

How many people really know
what SG does? Does it really do
anything? This year it sure has
not done much. Do you know SG
president’s name? How about the
board members’ names? You nev-

er hear from them except that '

they are trying to decide what
class ring to approve.

We need a more politically ac-
tive and energetic government.
We must be independent of the ad-
ministration not their mouth-
pieces. I believe the Undergrad-
uate Academic Review should be
made mandatory so students have
some‘ indication of the instruc-
tor’s ability and it may force pro-
fessors to put more effort into
their teaching.

The bookstore prices, Szabo

food, and the parking problems »

must be dealt with right away.

SG should be more visible and ac-
cessible to the students and be
prepared to fight any tuition or
other fee raises. Vote the People

Weller, and myself, Jeff Seifried.

Joe Simon

Student Government . . . what
good is it? That’s what many stu-
dents are saying, but who is to
blame. Certainly, the Student
Government itself, but even com-
petent members are kept so tan-
gled up in excess papperwork that
they become unpaid workers of
the administration instead of the
students.

Often they are too busy toltake
stands or action on important is-
sues. The easy. way out is to fol-
low administration guidelines,
thus rubber stamp government.
The same administration is often
responsible for discriminatory
hiring practices, which rob us of
some of the best professors, and
so called royalties (kickbacks) by
food magnates, book companies,
and service organizations, that
the student ends up paying for.

,\ I propose investigations in the

‘interest of the students to expose
administration wrong doings, and
monthly campus-wide meetings to
hear grievances and plan action.
Avoid falling prey to professional
politicians, and vested interested
candidates and let me be your
servant. v

» Scott Spadafore

I believe that I can adequately
and forcefully represent the stu-
dents’ opinion on the Student Gov-
ernment Board because of my
firm stands on important issues
and my knowledge of Student Gov-
ernment operation as Men’s
Dorm Council president. As MDC

"""«president I was fortunate enough

‘to participate in such tasks as
the renovation of the Towers and
the fight against Szabo Foods
which resulted in a non-manda-
tory meal ticket for next year.

Finally, I feel that the Univer-
sity is too bureaucratic with the
students’ support in this. cam-
paign, I will be better able to rep-
resent them on this issue as a
member of the Student Govern-
ment Board.

Janey Toth

As a sophomore nursing stu-
dent I have come "to recognize the
need for unity within our Univer-
sity. Each school needs to func-
tion as a separate entity while at
the same time realize that it is
part of the whole University.

From my experience on the
Nursing Council I perceive a lack
of communication among the dif-
ferenct schools, faculty, and stu-
dents. A student voice is needed
to help bring about cohesiveness
between these groups. Because of
my interest ‘and concern for the
University I will try to bring
about change.

Conrad Voltz

Studying at Pitt the past two
years has been a rewarding ex-

perience. Not only have new

thoughts and ideas penetrated
my mind, but a new feeling of re-
sponsibility, created by involve-
ment has brought me to want to
serve on Student Government.

,Two factors have combined to
develop my campus approach,
they are on the social and individ-
ual levels. On the social level,
ual levels. On the social level, I
am aware of the issues at the Uni-
versity and how the University
functions. These things have been
learned.through study and com-
munity involvement. The second
level, that of being an individual,
is the most important.‘ It is
through this that I-can give Stu-
dent Government a different tex-
ture using my own individuality
as a keystone.

Pitt has led me to participate
and excel in many facets of life,
widening my horizons through
academics, hospital experience,
and humanistic programs. With
the University doing so much for
me and realizing its shortcom-
ings, please let me put something
back into the system.

Greg Weller

I feel that the most important
thing about a Student Government
Board member is that he must be
responsive to the needs of the stu-
dents. Little can be said that
hasn’t already been said about
the quality of food in the cafeteria
and the high prices in the Pitt
bookstore. The time is over to just
talk about things like ‘that and
something should and must be
done.

On a larger scale, I feel the Uni-
versity must emerge as a politi-
cal force in the society as a whole.
The University is only a microro-
rum of the whole country. We as
students must make ourselves felt
in a political entity through the
Student Government; so we can
work to change the national politi-
cal scene. I hope to be able to
work to get needed reforms ac-
complished and ask for your vote
on the progressive action slate on
Jan. 17-17.

Boar-d Candidates  
A Column And A Half A

by JOHN METCALFE

-There was a reunion of sorts, right here in
the newsroom, after the extended break between
terms. A young woman I met last semester walked
in, and we recognized one another despite the long
separation.

I inquired after her health and general condi-
tion; she responded in kind. We did not shake hands,
as we are not that well acquainted. These social
amenities behind us, she admired the newsroom.
The teletype was clattering along; if I had expected
visitors I’d. have been typing as well, and might even
have arranged to have the phone ring.

At the very least I’d have had a hat pushed
back on my head.

She got to the purpose of her visit. She had
come to deliver a position statement in connection
with her candidacy for a position in Student Govern-
ment.

A moral dilemma, as so often happens, present-
ed itself. I had no idea what sortgof luck to wish her.
A confession follows. .

In an earlier avatar, before I joined the nar-

row circle of members of the Pitt community, I at-

tended another college. Thus, I am a transfer stu-
dent. ‘

At the other institution, which shall remain
nameless for both our sakes, I wrote for the news-
paper. As if that were not enough, the idea occurred
to me that I might consider being, a candidate for
public office. The experience would be interesting,
and I might learn humility through a familiarity
with the bitter taste of defeat.

Such was not to be the case. The ballots were

counted by a committee which included persons I
considered trustworthy; even so, I was declared a
winner.

I was shocked.

After years of complaining about incompetent '
government, I was obliged to participate in just -_

that.

I learned a_ lot. In almost all cases, the role of
Student Government is purely advisory. Nobody has
to listen to it. In one case action can be taken—the

spending of activity fee monies. Even there author- -

ity is limited. Legal grounds can always be found

to squash a particular expenditure. In fact, Student _

Government would be a good training ground for
any incipient congressmen among us.

In this case student legislatures have set the
pattern for the national congress. ,

Aside from such quibbles, successful candi-
dates for positions in Student Government will dis-

cover that their telephone numbers have become - 9

public property.

Further, they can expect to be expected to
know what is really going on. If they do not know,
they will be suspected of concealing vital informa-
tion. If they do know but do not say so, they will be
suspected of chicanery, or worse.

It is like the Army. I have been there and have
no intention of ever going back. '

I am reduced to general statements. _To /all

Letters to the Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

It is a shame that when Paul
Francis referred to his history of
abortion laws and population po-
licies in Nazi Germany he did not
concern himself more with his-
torical fact. He stated that the
strict Nazi ranti-bortion laws came
into being on May 9, 1943. This is
simply a falsehood.

In Germany Speaks, a book cir-
culated by the Reich Ministry for
Foreign Affairs in 1938, there is
an article, entitled “Population

v Policy” by Dr. Arthur Gutt, who

was the head of the National Hy
giene Department in the Ministry
of the Interior. On pages 48-49 it
states:

“ . . . People felt disinclined to
take upon themselves the respon-
sibilities of married life; birth
control was practiced to an unpar-
allelled extend, and the German
people were drifting towards ruin.

“When HerriHitler -took over
the government in 1933, he was
aware that, first of all, family life
must be restored to what it was.
That was indespensible if a
brighter future was to be in store
for the nation. On June 28, 1933,
Dr. Frick, the Minister of the In-
terior, announced the govern-
ment program in connection with

» its population policy. In -the course

of his speech he said that ‘the
greatest task before the govern-
ment of the national revolution is
to ensure the racial regeneration
of our people and to preserve its
numerical strength in the center
of Europe.:"

Thus, it can be seen that the

concern over the declining birth

rate was noticed and acted upon
by the Nazis nearly ten full years
before the date quoted by Mr.
Francis.

There are at least four other
books available in Hillman Li-
brary that demonstrate the non-
role of abortion in Hitler’s Ger-
many. I shall use only one of
them. ‘

In People Under Hitler, written
in 1942 by Wallace Deuel, it is

stated on pp. 249-250:

“The German birth rate began
to go up almost immediately after
the Nazis seized power. One of
the first things the party did in

its campaign to raise the birth"
, rate was to tighten up enforce-

ment of the laws forbidding abor-
tion, and this began to affect the
number of births almost at once.

“The Nazis also set out to dis-
courage the use of contraceptives.
Soon after seizing power, the par-
ty closed down birth control clin-
ics that had been operating under
the (Weimer) Republic, limited
the giving of birth control infor-
mation and forbade the advertise-
ment and public display of con-
traceptive devices.

“Under the Republic, the au-
thorities were relatively lax in en-

forcing anti-abortion laws. Prose- _

cutions were rare, convictions
were even more rare and sen-
tences light. Cases are on record
in which Berlin courts did nothing
more drastic than impose fines
of only 30 and 40 marks on per-
sons found guilty of abortion, for
example. This all speedly
changed when the Nazis took over
(emphasis mine). Known or sus-
pected abortionists were driven
out of the medical profession.
Several were sent to concentra-

tion camps without the formality“

of a trial. Others fled the coun-
try. -Prosecutions and convictions
multiplied and heavy sentences
were imposed. In the space of a
few weeks in the Summer of 1938,

‘three offenders were sentenced to

penal servitude for five years and
one month, six years, and seven
years, respectively.

“The result has been a sharp
decline in abortions in the Reich,
and a corresponding increase in
births."

What I suspect Mr. Francis
blundered upon with his 1943 fig-
ure was an account of the-special
concern towards the birth rate
that the Nazis showed that year.

“The high losses of the war . . .
inspired in the top leadership
from about 1943 onwards a flood
of ghastly projects in which the
pretentious narrow-mindedness

of small-animal breeders was un-
hesitatingly applied to the hu-
man world.” (From The Face of

the Third Reich by Joachim Fest, - "

p. 272.)

History is very clear about Hit-
ler’s position on population and

abortion. And Paul" Francis is

very wrong.

Sincerely,
Roger Johnson, GSPH

 After fighting their way back
 into the ballgame Wednesday

mented Pitt’s head basketball
coach Buzz Ridl on his team’s

* valiant but fruitless effort.

Early in the game things look-
ed pretty much like most of the
Panther showings so far this sea-
son and there was no hint of a
surging rally in sight. The Pitt
squad was cold and finally man-
aged to collect a field goal after
three minutes were gone in the
game.

The Panther guns remained
comparatively quiet for the next

few minutes of play while the
Davidson players, who were be-
ing shuffled in and out of action,

kept racking up points. By -11:46,
on the clock the Wildcats broke

the game open with an 11 point
spread on a layup by sophomore
Greg Dunn. They now led the
Panthers 22-11.

“In the first half whenvwe got
that 11 point led I might have
thought then that we had the
game won, but I knew better
than to think that that would be
the case,” related Davidson‘s
coach Terry Holland concerning
a lead which was to be their larg-
_est in the game.

But the Panthers were not to
be discounted yet. Within approx-
imately two minutes time the
Cats substantially cut the lead
down to four points.

be, a winning basketball season. Charles
tough time of it. p
« Gleeful, but not willing to make any predictions at the outset
of the season—but 16-10 would have been a good guess—the still

"Buzz"

stoic Ridl must be wondering whatever became of the supposed...»-u_
And along with an ever growing number of skeptics, he isat a loss’

to pin the blame on any one thing.

I It is no secret that fans .of'~athletics have the uncanny ability to
forget the good past in favor of the bitter present, or vice versa. 7

“Where are you going to coach next year,’ Ridl?”, an inquisi-

ptive fan yelled while things weren’t going so well in the recent

Wisconsin game. Ridl heard it, and if a red face‘ is any indication,
he was hurt by it too. »

“The students at this University are just dyingito rally around.a
winning athletic team. They want it badly and I’m certainly not
here to coach a losing team,” Ridl said. 7

If you keep your ears clean and listen a lot, the reasons given
for this year’s failure are many-fold. It is said that Ridl is using
too many players; that he should choose a startinglineup and hold
his breath. It is said that Ridl restricts natural ability on the court
with undue discipline; that he should advise instinctive play instead
of setting up and passing the ball for -the good shot—that’s the shot
anybody is supposed to make. I

There are those who think Ridl is a guilty advocate of good-
old-Westminister-type-basketball here at Pitt; that his technique lurks
somewhere between the dark ages and the present modern era of
collegiate'basketball—run, shoot, and run some more. '

Ridl hasn’t said it, but he "must be galled by the insinuation that
his coaching is old fashioned. He has done. most of what the press
and the fans have "asked of him. He has started and played fresh-
men (Tom Richards and Keith Starr), he has played Bill Knight
both inside and outside, he has used Knight to build his team around.

, He has done everything but win.

How quickly people have forgotten what Ridl has done. He
has returned the Pitt Basketball Program from the’ brink of humilia-

tion to the point where it can go after any basketball player infthe _

nation and make a bonafied sell.

Did anyone mind Westminister type basketball when it was
erasing the nightmarish memories of 4-22 seasons? In itself, this
Westminister thing is a myth, anyway. It implies that a team work
very cleverly for a\shot, patience.

Go up to Ridl’s office and ask him to show you the UCLA game
films. You might be awed to find the regularity UCLA passed the
ball seven, eight, or nine times for a shot against the Panthers earl-
ier in the year. Are we to construe this as good-old-John Wooden-
type-basketball? ' ' ' ’

Anyone who saw- the Jacksonville Dolphins in the recent Steel»
Bowl got a taste of what instinctive’ play can be like. With six all-
americans, the Dolphins couldn’t even beat the Duquesne Dukes.
Once they fell behind, the‘Floridians seemed to be outdueling each
other and seemed to be telling their coach to sit down and be quiet.

These same ‘kids’ that had been playing in allies all their lives
seemed to turn the Civic Arena into a dark ally with their bold in-
dividualistic play. Ridl -will take seven, eight, or nine passes any
time. And, he isn’t the only one.

To be Ridl and having to pick a starting lineup for the next
game is a tough.task, to say the least.

,- '<2,
No matter whom he starts, he will still have a contingent of goodc?

players still sitting on the bench. And while even the players feel
uncomfortable about being replaced so frequently, they are all get-
ting an adequate chance as a result.

Aside from a rest, Ridl uses substitution to find the one man .

who can spark a sloppy team on this one night.

The biggest cause of the Cats failure has been the players in-
ability to produce on an individual basis. They have not rebounded,
they have shot 30 per cent in air least one half of six games, and have
not been able to make the game deciding play, neither offensively
nor defensively. ,

The" Davidson Wildcats do it and they are 8-4.

“We try to use ten players every game,” Wildcat coach Terry
Holland said after his win Wednesday night, We feel that this can
only make us a better team in the long run: Our players go in fresh
and ours isateam‘effort.” ‘ ‘ " I A - . 4' . ~ .

 

    

 Duquesne,

 

I Pitt Battles Duquesne

by BART MACK

The name Duquesne University
isn't too popular around the lock-
er room of the Pitt Hockey Club
and it isn’t too difficult to under-
stand why. Last year Pitt was
rolling along in first place, mak-
ing a shambles of every league
opponent, until they came up
against the Dukes.

Duquesne, with ‘goaltender Fred
Wolkowitz in his finest hour. bat-
tled Pitt to a 3-3 tie. Pitt outshot
52-8, and outplayed
them by an even greater margin.
but the scoreboard still claimed
that the teams were even and
that’s what counted. I

The Duquesne-Pitt hockey riv-
alry was at a fever pitch before
the two squads even met last
year, and hundreds of Duke root-

ers at the Alpine voiced them?

selves energetically after the 3-3
contest. -The Pitt skaters are not
about to let that game fade from
their memories. ' I

a\ Things are a big different this
" year, however. Pitt is currently
-~ holding down the number onespot

but have been beaten once in
league play. Second place Carne-
gie-Mellon, the administrators of
that defeat, trails Pitt by two
points but /has played one less
game. The Tartans are idle un-
til Sunday so then they will have
two games in hand.

A Pitt victory over Duquesne on
Saturday woull put them four
points- ahead of C-MU and the
pressure would be on the Tartans.
Although C-MU slipped by Pitt.
they have had trouble with teams
that Pitt has handled with appar-
ent ease. Both St. Vincent’s and

‘.-.J..jJ.diana played the Tartans to

ties.

Duquesne is in third place of
the City Division, trailing Pitt by
six points. The Dukes post a 3-2
record which includes a 9-5 loss to
C-MU in the season opener. The
contest on Saturday will be a
four-pointer for both squads. It
will be the first of two games in
hand that the Dukes have on Pitt

and a win would throw them back
into the thick-of the division race.

Pitt could run their record to
7-1 by beating the Dukes and open
up an eight point lead over them.
A loss would put the dampers on
serious hopes that Duquesne
holds for first place.

The primary concern,--for the
Pitt defense will be Dudley Cot-
ton and C. H. Bender. Cotton was
his team’s second leading scorer
last year with seven goals and
seven assists. Bender coached the
Dukes last year but has taken to
the ice since he gained eligibility
upon enrolling. Bender is a highly
regarded skater and stickhandler.

After taking Carnegie-Mellon a
little too lightly, the Pitt skaters
have vowed» that they won’t be
caught sleeping again. The squad
will work out on Thursday night in
preparation for the contest.

Buses'will leave for the Alpine
at 4 p.m. from the Fifth Ave. side '

of the Student Union on Saturday.
Tickets may be purchased in ad-
vance fori50 cents from any team
member or at the Student Union
ticket office. Tickets at the door
will be $1.

In Bitter Ice Rivalr

Ice Chips: The Pitt team has

been playing before sparse
crowds this season and the play-
ers have been complaining. The
-loss to Carnegie-Mellon came in
front of a crowd of Tartan sup-
porters almost 300 strong. Last
year’s game with Duquesne was
quite similar. The Dukes always
draw large student contingencies

  Panthers Bows
To Davidson

(Continued from Page 6)

Pitt extended its lead to 62-55
but this time it was Davidson‘s
turn to desolve the lead. Through
the efforts of Falconi. John Pec-

'corak (both of which were high

scorers with 17 points each). and
Mike Sorrentino. Davidson con-
tinued to exchange a one point
lead with Pitt.

With three minutes remaining
the Wildcats started to play a
slowed down game. “We used
the slow down because we‘re not
very big,“ stated Holland. "And
in the last few minutes we want-
ed to be in control of our own
destiny — we would have gotten
beat if we had shot from the out-
side."

This maneuver did not wholely
succeed until sorrentino came
across with a layup with the time
at 0:47. and making the score 75-
53. The Wildcats iced it with
a fouls shot to finally subdue the
panthers.

‘ Rid] could not determine exact-
ly what was the cause for the
defeat of his squad. ‘'1 can't put
my finger on any one thing. not
in a game like that," he said.

A possible answer is the differ-
ence in the teams’ performances
at the charity line. While Pitt

completed 7-13 free throw shots. .
Davidson collected a total of 18- _

23.

The Panthers are now 4-8 and
will try to improve their record
when they travel to Bucknell to-
morrow and take on the Bisons at

Wrestlers Seek Twin—bill Win

by BILL PROUDFOOT

Coming off what coach Dave
Adams calls "our most impres-
’ sive showing of the year.“ Pitts
wrestling team has a chance to
_get over the .500 hump this wekk-
end with back to back meets

 against Delaware and Maryland

at 8/p.m. this Friday and Satur-
day at the Field House.

Adams was referring to last
Saturday's match against the al-
ways powerful Midshipmen of

 Navy. The Cats lost out in the end.

I

but had sweat beading on more
than one Middle lip. Pitt was
squeaked out 19-15. ,

The two matches will give
Adams a chance to shake up his
‘ lineup a bit. for two reasons. One

is a matter of weight control.
“It‘s tough holding the weight
down two days in a row.“ he said.

More importantly, Adams
wants more of his squad to par-
ticipate in the actual meets. “I
want to give some of these guys
some meet experience. There are
guys doing a real good job in prac-
tice, and they deserve a chance
to show what they can do.”

Against Delaware, Adams in-
tends to wrestle Dave DeMarino
at 118 pounds, in place of Bryant.
while Don Rother will start in
DeMarino‘s former 126 slot. Bob
Bailey, back from an injury. will
replace Buzzy Beck at 134 pounds.

In the 142 pound class either
Brad Strayerlor Ron Selfridge

will wrestle and Dan Levine will
go in the 150 pound slot. John
Chatman and Dallatore are set in
the 158 and 167 pound spots. Cas-
ciola and Calgrinini will replace
Jim Caramanna and Craig Tritch.
while Carl Roba is set at heavy-
weight.

Delaware is 3-1, winning over
West Virginia, Lafayette, and Du-
quesne, while losing to Pennsyl-
vania wrestling power Waynes-
burg.

Probably the most interesting
matchup of Friday’s meet will be
in the 158 pound class, as ‘Pitt‘s
"Bimbo” Chatman goes to the
mat with Nick Martin of Wilming-
ton, Dela. Martin is unbeaten this
year and owns a 13-0 streak over

 Cardot Clouls Clarion

by RON SIEGEL
Willis Cardot, who earlier in
the season lead the varsity to vic-
tory over Rutgers, performed fur-

’: ther heroics Wednesday night.

1 leading Pitt’s junior varsity to a
112-73 victory over Clarion State

iw_ _ college jayvees.

'2‘!

The win. coupled with an 86-59
victory over Youngstown a week
earlier, gave the Cubs a perfect
4-0 record. '

I’ The game started out as a see-

 saw contest, with neither team-

.holding any sizeable leads. Car-
- dot hit two free throws to make

I .- the score 27-22. and from there,

-‘Pitt opened up a substantial lead.
which it never relinquished.

A There were other stars-for Pitt
.. , as well. Bobby Shrewsbury, in ad-

dition to outstanding passing and
ball control, netted 20 points, and
Willie Kelly lead all scorers with
28.

“They all played well. but Car-
dot really made the difference."
explained assistant coach Mike
Paul.

Cardot took over where he left
off in the Rutgers game. as well
as all of last year on. the fresh-
man team.

Not only was he shooting and
passing well, he was the team’s

jmoral leader. His tenacious de-

fense, accompanied by biting re-
marks caused the opposition to
worry more about Cardot than the
game, and this often resulted in
Pitt’s other» players being wide
open.

As play was about to resume
after a timeout. and with his op-
ponent standing right next to him.
Cardot inquired as to the score.
knowing full well that it was "65-
42." replied Horse Czarnecki.
the" official timer. "Tell them to
bring a decent team next year.“
cracked Cardot.

When a team hits for 112 points.
everybody is usally hitting. and
John Endsly and Greg McBride
both hit for 17 points, but lost
some the recognition because of
the higher marks of their team-
mates.‘

The Cubs face two tough tests
in the next few days, when they
play road contests at Youngs-
town and Pitt-Greensburg. The
jayvees defeated both of these op-
ponents at the Field House ear-
lier this season, but have to be
tested on the road.

Did Cardot play well enough to
be on the varsity? "He‘s on it
now." replied Paul. as Cardot
switched uniforms and joined the
squad for the Davidson game.

Delaware coach Paull Billy be-
lieves the key to the match is in
the lighter weights. "They're
strongest in the middle weights.

strong in the heavier weights
where they’re weak, so the meet
' could be won in the light weights.

Maryland, which beat Pitt last
year, is having its troubles this
season. They’re 0-3 and have not
wrestled since Dec. 9. Maryland
comes to Pittsburgh on the sec-
ond meet of what might seem to
them to be the world’s longest
road trip. Beginning on Jan. 12,
the Terps are scheduled for seven
meets in nine days.

To compound the Terrapin's

woes. two starters, 177 pound Pat
McCall and 135 pound Tom Pap-

pas, are very doubtful to see ac-
tion due to injuries. Both are last
years ACC champs at their
weights, and will be replaced by
freshmen Randy Waters and Tim
Rowen if they cannot start.

Maryland, by the way, has two
brother combinations. Pete and
Tom Pappas, at 126 and 134.
with George and Terry Myers at
158 and 167 pounds.

‘At heavyweight for the Terps
will be 6’5’’, 240 pound defensive
tackle Si Jernigan.

Despite the unimpressive rec-
ord of Maryland. Adams is wary

of the Terrapin team and hopes ‘

to have some student support for
both meets. “Maryland is going
with just about the same team
that beat us last year.” he said.
"so we'll have to be ready.“

Cat Swimmers
Face Bucknell

By YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt team will face the Bi-
sons of Bucknell tomorrow in
what should be a very exciting
meet at Trees Hall Pool at 2:00
p.m. -

The Cats are coming into the
meet after defeating Temple in
their first regular meet of the sea-
son. Pitt will be out to avenge a
crush'ing 75-38‘ loss to Bucknell
last year.

Bucknell is having a very good
year with some very strong fresh-
men on the team to complement
some of their outstanding up-
perclassmen. They have already
defeated Colgate and finished
in second place in the Penn State
relays earlier this year, the same
meet in which Pitt finished fifth,
although the point spread be-
tween the two teams was not that
large.

Some of the stars to watch from
the Bucknell team are diver Bob
Richards who should offer a chal-
lenge to the Pitt’s outstanding
divers. Some other people to watch
are an All-American by the name

of Winings and Schwanhausser
in the backstroke. Bucnell’s coach
insists that this is the best team
he's coached in six years at the
school.

The outlook for Pitt is also
quite good. The medley relay is
always a good event for the team
and John Templin should put in
a good showing in the 200-yard
breaststroke. Mark Winters is a
strong contender in the distance
events, the 500 and 1000—yard
free-style. He is equal to if not
better than his Bucknell counter-
parts.

Some good races to watch will
be Mark Wallace and Barry Kita
in the 200-yard butterfly event
and Dave Natali against Schwan-
hausser in the 200-yard butterfly.
Natali won the event against Tem-

.ple with a very good time.
