Disabled get

By Sam Gresock
Graphics Assistant

 

Students with disabilities are
gaining more and more access
to academic services, accord-
ing to Disability Resources
and Services Coordinator

Marcie Roberts.

In accordance with the fed-
eral Americans with
Disabilities Act, the

University of Pittsburgh has
been implementing measures
for the accommodation of dis-
abled members of the Pitt
community in classrooms.
Roberts spoke at yesterday’s
Faculty Assembly meeting to
discuss services the ofﬁce pro-
vides and how faculty can
work with Disability
Resources and Services to
ensure students full accommo-
dations. -
According to Roberts, 20
students currently receive ser-

said the majority of these stu-

dents are freshmen and trans-

fer students, which reflects

Pitt’s increasing accessibility
‘ for students with disabilities.

“What we’re ﬁnding is that
the more accessible we
become, the more we’re going
to be tapped into as an accessi-
ble campus with accessible
programs,” Roberts said. “And
these numbers are going to
increase significantly.”

At the beginning of semes-
ters, instructions are available
for students who need special
services so they can notify
their instructors and Disability
Resources and Services.
Roberts said this can allow
accommodations to be made

vices through the office. She‘

terday’s meeting.
as quickly and efficiently as
possible.

“’I‘his is deﬁnitely the intent
of my office, and something
that I really stress to students
is the importance of identify-
ing [disabilities] early, regis-
tering with me and getting
everything out in a timely
fashion so there is no surprise
along the way,” she said.

Roberts said the main ser- -
vice provided by her-office is
adaptive testing for students
who cannot take conventional
exams. .

“We maintain as much con-
trol over an exam as you

would in a classroom,” she
said. “We proctor exams very
closely, almost entirely one-
on-one.”

According to Roberts,
exams are kept in a locked ﬁle
cabinet until students are ready
to take them and are delivered
back to instructors shortly
after students take them.

Additionally, some exams
are individually suited for par-
ticular disabled students’
needs, according to Roberts.

“We do very creative things
sometimes to address the
accommodation issue,”

In celebration of election day, members of
Students for Life got a first-hand look at pro-life
candidate Clyde Wilhelm, who is running for the

state legislature.

Wilhehn made an appearance at the Sﬂ. meet-
ing last night to stress the importance of voting for
pro-life candidates on election day.

“We need to stand up and do something before
it’s too late,” Wilhelm said. “Abortion should not

ple.”

Wilhelm, who is running against current state

legislator Ron Cowell, said every life should be
protected by the Constitution. In reference to the
pro-choice issue, Wilhelm said those people should
be thought of as pro-death, rather than pro-choice.

“Most people that are pro-choice are not ﬁghting

for a choice but for power and control,” she said.
As a Christian, Wilhelm said he believes all

fetuses have a right to life and that no one can

be left in the hands of the govemment or the peo-

Homeless
debate

  heightens

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

While cashier Karen
DeAngelisworked last Sunday
at a local convenient store on
Forbes Avenue, a student
walked in and complained about
a panhandler who called her a
name when she wouldn’t give
him money.

“She said, ‘Why is it every
time I come into this store I get
harassed and abused by these
panhandlers?” DeAngelis said.

DeAngelis, like some Pitt stu-
dents, said she would support
legislation to push the panhan-
dlers out of Oakland, but some
from the Community Human
Services Corporation say an
anti—panhandling ordinance
would unfairly treat all panhan-
dlers as criminals.

“We don’t dispute the fact that
some panhandlers are aggres-

sive,” said Dan Robinson, coor- V

dinator for Operation Save a
Life. “But most panhandlers I
know are not aggressive —— and
I know a lot of them.”

OSAL volunteers distribute
information, blankets and coats
to homeless individuals in
Pittsburgh, including those in
Oakland.

It’s not fair to “lump everyone
into one category and then try to
lobby for legislation,” Robinson
said.

Robinson commented on a
letter that Pitt Director of Public
Safety Rick Boyd sent to the
Associate Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance John
DeVitto. The letter said that out
of 30 Oakland panhandlers,
only seven are homeless.
According to the report, these
30 people have warranted over
400 arrests and 753 criminal
charges. '

Robinson said the letter “was
just lumping everyone into one
category, calling people crimi-
nals  trying to dehumanize the
plight of the people out there in
order to gain support.”

OSAL wants to “put a face to
these people,” Robinson said.
Looking at them as a collective

group, instead of as individuals,

ROME — One of Italy’s
bloodiest criminal mysteries
was solved on Wednesday
after a Florentine court sen-
tenced an elderly farm worker
— who preyed on courting
couples — to life imprison-

Pietro Pacciani, 69, was
given a life sentence after a
jury ruled he was the “Monster
of Florence” sexual serial
killer who killed 14 people in
a reign of terror in the beauti-
ful Tuscan countryside
between l974 and 1985.

The attacker shot courting
couples, including four for-

DRIEDORF, Germany — A
major manhunt in Germany
ended on Tuesday with the
surrender of the second of two
escaped convicts who had led
German police on a two-day
chase of mayhem and robbery
across the country.

Raymond Albert, jailed for
decapitating a man with a

I machete and said to be a high-

ly trained killer from the for-
mer East Germany’s crack
commandos, gave up after
eluding hundreds of hunters
for a whole day in woodland

near Driedorf, north of
Frankfurt. .
Albert’s accomplice,

Gerhard Polak, 35, who had
been serving time for armed
robbery, was captured earlier
on Tuesday. _

At least 300 police, along
with special GSG-9 comman-
dos, armored cars, tracker
dogs and helicopters, had been
drafted in to search for the two
men, who had led police on a
whirlwind 620—mile chase

Panhandlers

°From page 1
dehumanizes them and is similar
to the tactics Hitler used, he
said.

“I’m talking about 30 speciﬁc
individuals,” Boyd said. “As far
as panhandlers not included in
the report that don’t have a crim-
inal record, I can’t address them
 [because] I don’t know who
they are.”

Boyd said Pitt plainclothes
ofﬁcers gathered the information
presented in the letter by going
back through the ﬁles that docu-
mented the 30 individuals’ crim-
inal records.

The group of panhandlers pro-
ﬁled in the report should “under-
stand that they’re not welcome
here,” Boyd said. He has asked
his ofﬁcers to pay special atten-
tion to these individuals. The
officers will arrest individuals
who they see using intimidation
or harassment to get money
from passers-by.

Boyd also said his main con-
cern is to protect students, staff
and faculty on campus, not to
care for the homeless.

“The issue. is whether or not it
is responsible for Public Safety
to ignore the fact that these are
people with extensive criminal
backgrounds and to let them
hang out and do whatever they
want,” he said.

The letter also said Public
Safety will support any effort
put forth by Pittsburgh City
Council to draft an anti—panhan-

dling ordinance. But Boyd told
The Pitt News he does not have
a specific proposal, and he has
no intention to introduce legisla-
tion.

“I’ve indicated that if the dis-
cussion were to be revived or if
there is a particular individual
that is looking for some support
in trying to implement an ordi-
nance, I would be happy to
cooperate with that person, but
nobody’s approached me,” he
said.

According to Matt Dodge, an
aide to council member Dan
Cohen who represents Oakland,
Cohen has not introduced any
anti-panhandling legislation.

But council member Bob
O’Connor said he is “actively
looking at either getting [pan-
handling] under control or get-
ting [panhandlers] off the
streets.” O’Connor said he com-
mends Pitt for also moving in
that direction.

If a panhandler harasses an
individual, that individual
should call the police, Robinson
said. But police should deal with
each panhandler separately by
responding appropriately to each
incident, not by trying to pass
legislation, he said. For many,
money earned through panhan-
dling is their only source of
income, according to Robinson.

Another problem with legis-'
lating aggression is that harass-
ment or intimidation is based on
perception, Robinson said. What

one person calls harassment
may not bother another person.

DeAngelis said she calls cam-
pus police about once a week to
remove the panhandlers stand-
ing outside the convenient store
where she works. Customers
come into the store frustrated
after walking past the panhan-
dlers.

“You can go and ask them real
nice to please leave the premises
and they’ll come in and scream
obscenities at me,” DeAngelis
said.

Some customers believe the
store supports the panhandlers
by allowing them to stand out-
side, DeAngelis said. Customers
often ask “why don’t you get rid
of them?” she said.

“Solicitation is a constitution-
ally protected activity,” said Vic
Walczak, executive director of
the American Civil Liberties
Union, the greater Pittsburgh
chapter.

“Legally, tl1ere’s no difference
between United Way, someone
from the Salvation Army with a
bucket and a homeless person
with a cup. Any law that curtails
this is suspect.

“On the other end, you have a
right to solicit, you don’t have a
right to harass,” Walczak said.
“If someone corners you and
won’t let you leave, that’s not
constitutionally protected.’_’

Boyd said some panhandlers
lie about their need in order to
get money, and students should

be aware of this.

One woman takes her juvenile
daughter along to approach peo-
ple, tells them that someone has
stolen her purse and that she
needs bus fare to get her daugh-
ter home, Boyd said. Sometimes
she forgets who she has
approached and talks to the
same person twice in one day,
he said.

‘”That’s a crime, that’s a scam,
that’s a con game,” Boyd said.
“We don’t need that type of
thing.”

“I don’t believe they’re home-
less,” DeAngelis said of the pan-
handlers in front of the store. “If
they’re homeless, disabled or
maimed in some way, then
maybe I can accept it, but not
[from] physically able people.”

But OSAL volunteers found
last year in a survey for a county
study that out of 47 panhandlers
who solicit downtown, 74 per-
cent are homeless, Robinson
said. Homeless means “people
living in a shelter, under a bridge
somewhere," but not people
who “double up” with other
families or individuals, he said.

Volunteers asked these indi-
viduals why they believe they
are homeless, Robinson said.
Fifty—one percent pointed to
poor economics or lack of
affordable housing. Forty—nine
percent pointed to either drug or
alcohol abuse.

of the amount of time and effort

purely visual for a deaf student

Professor Barbara Shore of the

“The ADA is considered the
most signiﬁcant civil rights leg-
islation to have been passed in
the United States since the civil

Shore said.

“It is extremely momentous,

At Sea program and other

funding his travels with
scholarships from various

Megon Barlow, who is cur-
rently finishing her last year
at Pitt, has also had a variety
of study abroad experiences.
She repeated her senior year
of high school in Brussels,
Belgium, on a rotary scholar-
ship, spent the spring of ‘93
on Semester at Sea for which
she received Pitt’s
Augmentation Award, stud-
ied in Poland the spring of
‘94 on a Samantha Smith fel-
lowship and interned in
Moscow this past summer
teaching English.

One of Megon’s most
memorable experiences is
from a stop on Pitt’s
Semester at Sea voyage. She
and a few other students
spent the night near Madras,
India, at an Untouchable vil-
lage. In India the the popula-
tion is divided into castes,
Brahmans being the highest
cast and Untouchables being
the lowest. Megon said she
was amazed at the hospitali-
ty of the village. The vil-
lagers painted their faces in
welcome and put jasmine in
her hair. Many of these peo-
ple had never seen foreigners
before, so the children
couldn’t help but stare. The
Untouchables put on a show
for the students and the chil-

 

dren sang. After the festivi-
ties, they were led by torch
light to other accommoda-
tions in a missionary church
where straw mats had been
laid on the ﬂoor for them.

Nolan Farhy studied in
Hong Kong all last year at
the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, where all his
courses were taught in
English. He was completely
integrated with the native
students — being one of five
exchange students in a dorm
of 600.

Nolan took advantage of
his holidays by backpacking.
He was able to see a lot of
Southeast Asia including
Thailand, Malaysia and the
Philippines. He also interned
in Hong Kong over the sum-
mer. His position was as a
research analyst for the
Vietnam Fund, the first
direct investment country
fund dedicated to Vietnam.
Nolan was impressed with
the life-long friendships he
made with both Chinese stu-
dents and other foreign stu-
dents. Nolan also spent the
spring of ‘92 on Semester at
Sea.

Jeremy Rinker studied in

described the detailed procedure involved
in an abortion and the effects the abortion
has on the fetus and mother.

“The fetus is torn apart, dismembered,
crushed and destroyed by the steel instru-
ments of an abortionist,” Nathanson said.

The video includes the reaction of a 12-
week-old fetus being aborted. Through an

motion, Nathanson described step by step
how the baby is aborted and the response
of the fetus to this operation.

“At 12 weeks the fetus is fully formed,”
he said. “Recent technologies have con-
vinced us that beyond question the fetus is

“I think it’s important that we
give students the opportunity to
come and ask questions if they
want to,” said Heinrichs.

SGB President Ross Pasquale
also said the forum is a great
way for students to learn about
the candidates.

“I think it’s the best opportu-
nity for students to ask the can-
didates questions about their
experiences and let them show
how well they can think on their
feet,” said Pasquale.

He also mentioned the effects
the forum had on his presiden-
tial campaign last year.

,“I think it was one of the best
vehicles for exposure for myself

when I was candidate last year,”
Pasquale said.

According to Pasquale,
approximately 300 students
attended last year’s forum, and
he expects the same this year.

Though Heinrichs said she is
unsure of how many students
will attend, she said the forum
has been a success in the past.

Also, Heinrichs said that
more students attending the

This abortion was one of the 4,000 per-
formed that day in the United States,
Nathanson said. The doctor, who per-
formed the abortion, had previously done
10,000 abortions in his life, and after see-

ing the video decided not to perform any-
more.

According to Nathanson, the average
cost of an abortion is between $300 and
$400, and 90 percent of the money is
going into the hands of the physicians.
Nathanson suggested that a video such as
“The Silent Scream” be shown to a
woman before she makes a decision to
have an abortion.

Enhance Pres Council

The President’s Council is a forum for all governance group
presidents on campus to discuss campus concerns. There are
seven governance groups: the Black Action Society,.the
Resident Students Association, Panhellenic Association,
Interfratemity Council, Engineering Student Council, Nursing
Student Association and the Academy of Students of Pharmacy.
Also, though not full members, the Campus Women s
Organization and the Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance are
always invited to the meetings.

The Pitt News is in full favor of this council. We believe it
"provides a constructive forum for the groups to get together and
-share their respective concerns about what needs to be done and
what each considers problems at Pitt. It also aids in the construc-
tion of a unified campus community, helping the groups to work
together and understand the goals and motives of other campus
organizations. _

But not all campus groups and organizations are part of this
council. There are a number of smaller groups that are integral

- parts of this university as well. To really promote a unified Pitt,

there should be an opportunity for these groups to be heard in a
unified forum as well.

We are not advocating the elimination of the President’s
Council, indeed we believe it should remain as it is. However,
we propose that the concept be expanded so that once a semester
or year there is an open forum for the presidents of all clubs and
organizations. One could call it the President’s Council
Conference. ,

All organizations have a vested interest in the future of Pitt,
and it is only fair that they all have their voice. Logistically, it is
wise to have one small council of the largest and most inﬂuen-
tial organizations; however, to occasionally have a conference
which involves all campus organizations would be a wise move.

Unnecessary bombing

U.S. bombers dropped 55,000 pounds of explosives in the
Kuwaiti desert yesterday in a show of force directed at Iraq.
The Pitt News believes this action was unnecessary and a
waste of U.S. resources and money.

We certainly have plenty of bombs, but should we use them
so cavalierly just to show Saddam Hussein our resolve
against him? Apparently, kicking his butt three years ago
wasn’t quite enough since he recently massed troops on the
Kuwaiti border. However our quick response more than
demonstrated the resolveof the United States. and the inter-
national community to prevent Hussein from any future
reigns of terror.

Furthermore, even though it was desert, it is unlikely
55,000 pounds of explosives were good for the environment.
Deserts are not completely dead areas and some have delicate
ecosystems. To simply drop bombs for what appears to be no
good reason is an irresponsible act by the United States.

The United States hardly needs shows of force. Our military
superiority is unquestioned in the world. It might be wiser if
we made more efforts to get -along with the rest of the world
rather than simply showing our obvious strength.

Content of Heinz 's speech lost

Last Thursday, Teresa Heinz
spoke as this semester’s
American Experience guest lec-
turer. On Friday, she made
front page news in the
Pittsburgh Post Gazette for hav-
ing openly criticized
Republican Senatoiial candidate
Rick Santorum. By Monday,
her talk had made national
news; National Public Radio
mentioned it in a- report about
the ‘split in the Republican party.

Unfortunately, much of the
substance of her talk has been
lost in these accounts. The title
of her talk was “Leading Amid
Chaos,” and was not about the
problems facing the Republican
party. Rather, it was about the
problems facing the nation as a
whole.

Although her remarks about
the current race must not bedis-
missed as unimportant, never-
theless, the record must be set
straight. More than just giving
the audience her insight on the
current campaign, Heinz was
providing a valuable insight on
the way government is operat-
ed. .

More importantly, however,
she offered suggestions as to
how the task of governing and
choosing leaders can be
improved. Instead of merely
describing the problem, she
looked at solutions.

Yet, Heinz seems to have
been done in by one of the very
same challenges to good gov-
ernment which she raised in her
speech. The media directs pub-
lic attention, and she said that
people who run for office must
think and respond in 30—second
sound bites. The result is that
the people in office cannot think
aloud and talk honestly with
their constituents. They can’t
ever say “I don’t know.”

This is where the remark
about Santorum making for
good television came from. He
was an important example of
the problem. Yet, the media
picked up on this and quoted
her in what could easily be a
sound bite. If the solution is pre-

sented in the form of the prob-
lem, how will it ever come to
fruition?

Leading amid. chaos also
involves a different approach
than what is all to prevalent in
politics today. Effective leader-
ship means facing problems
creatively and practically, not
ideologically. The former leads
to solutions, the latter to goose-
stepping.

. After setting out alarming sta-
tistics about teenage pregnancy,
Heinz got to the heart of the
matter when discussing how the
problem should be approached.

She said, “We don’t need to
moralize about this; we don’t
need to say who is right and
who is wrong. What do we do?”

The last question is the crux
of the leadership problem. This
question is probably one of the
last asked and answered in pub-
lic debate on the issues.
Congress is an example of this,
but the reason why illustrates
something about the problems
in government today. Drawing

‘W

on her knowledge of the late '

Senator John Heinz’s experi-
ence, she described the life of a
senator. “Legislators have no
time to become experts on any-
thing,” she said. This gives the
appointed staff the chance to
take over and direct a senator’s
agenda for him through the
information they provide. Thus,
Congressmen have no real way
to get at questions which need
to be asked.

The solution, she said, was to
lirriit the number of committees.
The more committees a con-
gressman serves on, the greater
his pool of potential financial
backers for campaigns. So,
Congressmen want to serve on
as many as possible. Changing
the way campaigns are funded
and limiting the number of
committees would help to recti-
fy this situation.

Other important points were
brought up —- the inﬂuence of
technology on our lives, crime,
etc. These along with the sug-
gestions provided and the ques-

tions asked show the impor-
tance of an event like this for
the university.

When someone with Teresa
Heinz’s insight comes to the
University of Pittsburgh, the
faculty, students and surround-
ing community have a tremen-
dous opportunity. Many stu-
dents may finally see living
examples of what they’ve read
about. Bringing the community
in breaks down the “ivory
tower” sense of isolation that
can set in on a university carn-
pus.

There is nothing like being in
the same room with the actual
person who manages a trust,
holds an office or has conducted
an important research project.
Any speaker worth their salt
will allow time for questions at
the end of his talk, providing
the chance for interaction.

Through this interaction, stu-
dents and faculty can gain a
greater insight into the world
around them. It can also provide
opportunities for interaction
across disciplines and outside of
the formal classroom setting
which is invaluable to free
inquiry. ,

Events like Heinz’s talk also
give the community a chance to
come to the university and
engage in a dialogue, not only
with the lecturer, but also with
those in academia. Community
connections like this are essen-
tial.

In summation, the importance
of events like this must be
stressed. Students, professors
and members must get together
in the same room with people of
prominence. This way they are
able to find out what is really
being said. Better information
leads to better thinking about a
problem. The university is an
excellent vehicle to make this
happen, and it does. This way,
important ideas aren’t lost to
campaign coverage as sound
bites and glib thinking.

Redshirting
not in
Martin '5
st interest

litt run-
ning
back

Curtis
Martin has a
big decision
to make in
the next few
weeks.
Martin is

deliberating
on whether
the sprained ankle he
received in week two against
Ohio U. will cause him to
redshirt and come back in
1995 or forego the season
and test his value in the pro
market.

If Martin were to return
next year, it would be the
best possible scenario for
Pitt. The Panthers would be
an infinitely more dangerous
team with him in the back-
field. Defenses would have
to contend with two out-
standing backs — packed
with completely different
styles — in Martin and Billy
West.

But a return for a fifth sea-
son might not be the ideal
situation for Martin.

Martin isn’t saying much,
particularly to the media,
about which way he is
leaning, but what rea-
sons does he have for stay-
ing?

Coach Johnny Majors
offered one when he said
that every pro scout Majors
spoke with on the matter
advised Martin to run
through another college sea-
son. '

However, a return might
not improve Martin’s stand-
ing with the NFL. When the
‘94 season started, Martin
was the lone threat on a pal-
try Panther attack. In the
opening game, Martin broke
open for 251 yards against
a highly-ranked Texas
team. He was coming off a
junior year that was as scin-
tillating as almost any in Pitt
history.

Martin has proven his met-
tle while running for his
life on teams that have won
eight games in the last three
years.

The Pitt backfield would
be loaded if Martin played in
‘95, and therein lies the bin-
drance. Martin would be
forced to share the football
with West, who currently
leads the Big East in rush-
ing, and only an injury could
keep him from finishing the
season in that spot.

West is a strong runner
who averages 5.4 yards per
clip. His performance in

Former Pitt track star Ellis has higher calling

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

When Elbert Ellis was a freshman
at Hillside High School in Durham,
N.C., he was faced a choice that he
thought would change his life. During
that year, he decided to give up football
so he could excel in track.

It was one of the best decisions
E l 1 i s
made, as
he was
voted the

former ﬂltﬂletes of the

Year.

As a senior, he accepted an athletic
scholarship to Pitt.

Now, more than‘ eight years later,
Ellis — who was a three time All-_
American while a Panther — is starting
to get back to the sport he loves.

He is presently a member of the
Pittsburgh Steelers’ practice squad.

It all started when he was talking to
his cousin, Ray Ellis, over Christmas.

“[Ray] told me a couple of agents and
some scouts were looking at me when I
was at the Pan Am games down in
Cuba,” Ellis recalls. “They were won-
dering if they could convert me over to
football.”

 
 
 

‘I/I/ﬁat Tliey Do Now

After talking to Ray, Ellis decided to
give it a shot.

“I was trying to get a tryout with the
Atlanta Falcons, but it fell through,” he
said.

Then one day while he was riding the
bus, Dave Zemba (the bus driver) asked
what he did for a living.

“I told him I used to run track and
now I am a teacher,” said Ellis. “Then I
told him I was supposed to have a try-
out with Atlanta, but I didn’t have the
money for the ticket. He said, ‘Maybe I
know somebody who could help you
out.’ He knew somebody with the
Steelers.

“I gave him my track bio and he said
he’ll see what he could do. He called
me the next night and said I had to have
a meeting with a guy named Shawn
Flaherty.”

After telling Flaherty, who later
became his agent, how eager he was to
play professional football, he got his
shot.

“I had a tryout that Thursday at Three
Rivers Stadium with [Steeler head]
Coach [Bill] Cowher and a couple other
coaches,” he said. “The next thing I
know, Coach Cowher came up to me
and said, ‘We will be in touch.’ I’ve
been down there ever since.”

On that rainy day, the 6-foot-5 inch,
207-pounder caught the coaches’ eyes
by running a 4.38 in the 40-yard dash in
44-degree weather.

“I was so impressed with his raw tal-
ent,” said Steelers receivers coach Chan

Gailey. “He is a big guy that can really
run, and his work habits are very good
as well.”

After showing the coaches his speed,
his next test would be how could he
take a hit. In a scrimmage with the
Washington Redskins, Ellis passed the
test.

“I had this one hit in the first presea-
son game against the ‘Skins,” he said.
“Going for a long ball, I hadthe corner-
back beat, but I didn’t see the safety

After injuries, demofions, Williams finally cracks starting lineup

The Pitt News, Wednesday, November 2, 1994

In his freshman season,
Williams played in only four
games because of nagging
leg injuries.

He did score on his
first carry of his collegiate
career, a two-yard burst into
the end zone against
Maryland.

The next year, Williams
was beginning to show his
high school brilliance when
he suffered a devastating
injury thatwould end his

‘ season and, it looked like,

maybe his career.

Williams had ruptured his
Achilles’ tendon in practice
prior to the Notre Dame

“At first I thought I would

Williams said.

thought I was hit with a
brick in the back of my
Achilles. That was the most
painful experience I’ve ever
had.”

Williams finished his
sophomore season with 30
carries for 90 yards and one
touchdown.

He rushed for a career-high
42 yards on seven-carries
against Rutgers,- and he
scored his second career
touchdown against Kent.
Williams had surgery to
repair his Achilles’ in
November of 1992 and
missed all of spring drills
recuperating.

“I was timid [after the
injury],” Williams said. ‘‘I
wouldn’t run as hard as I
used to run, it altered my
game a lot.”

The following year,
Williams returned to the
Panther lineup and played in
three games for Pitt.

He suffered an elbow
injury that forced him to
miss the rest of the season,
and he sat out with a medical
redshirt.

“I was blocking against
Virginia Tech and I thought I
had broken a bone in my
elbow,” Williams said.

more little injuries. I talked

decided to take the redshirt.”

After Williams was forced
to sit out his second consec-
utive season because of
injury, he had hit bottom. He
had fallen to the end of the
depth charts, and there was
no sign of improvement. The
football program had moved
on without him.

“In a way I wanted to give
up football,” Williams said.
“I thought that I would never
be the same person again,
never the same as when I
came in here.

“There was not a lot I
could do,” Williams said. “I
was down in the dumps, and
Curtis Martin and everybody
else told me to wait and that
my time would come.”

At this point, Williams
found the faith and persever-
ance that he needed to get
through his ordeal.

“My faith in God has
changed me,” Williams said.
f‘I am better now than when I
first came to Pitt.”

This season has been an up
and down one for Williams.
He started the season as the
No. 2 fullback but fell to
third-string when Maurice’

°From page 8

Washington began to play
well.

But Williams returned
to the Panther lineup
two weeks ago against
Virginia Tech as a blocking
back.

“It felt good going home,”
Williams said.

“I know a lot of the guys
on the Virginia Tech squad.
It was just like a homecom-
ing.”

This season has been
disappointing to the
Panthers, who are sporting
a 2-7 record with two
games left on the schedule,
but Williams is not giving
up.

“After every game we just
have to keep preparing for
the next game,” Williams
said.

“If you’re down on one
game and it keeps carrying
on to the next one, you
won’t produce.”

With the faith that
Williams has, and if
the injury bug has been
exterminated, the days
ahead should be bright for
him.

Column

°From page 7
Martin’s absence demands
a starting role again next
year, which means Martin,
in a year where he is
attempting to re-establish
himself as a top pro
pick, would have to
trade time and carries
with a guy coming off a
1,000-yard season. Pitt
just isn’t talented enough
to keep either one on the
bench.

Martin, therefore, is
transformed from a
sparkling back that carried
a terrible team to a
split-time player on a
squad that at this point
shows little promise for
improvement.

A return in ‘95 might
not upgrade doubts
about Martin’s durability
either. Martin has
missed extended time
due to injury in each of
his four years at Pitt.
Another year might prove
detrimental. Martin could
suffer a more serious
injury than the nagging
variety he has been associ-
ated with in his college

career.

Chances are, the running
lanes may not be as
defined next year. The
Panthers will undergo
a turnover on the offen-
sive line, meaning Martin
loses key elements in his
past successes. Reuben
Brown, considered by
some pro scouts as the top
lineman in college, will
move on to the NFL.
Lawson‘ Mollica, a four-
year starter at center, and
Matt Bloom, a force as a
run blocker, will also grad-
uate.

If Martin skips the red-
shirt and enters the NFL
draft, he is considered a
back with first-round tal-
ent, who happens to
be injured, and who has
a chance to improve
that perception at the
February scouting com-
bines.

If Martin returns, he
risks lowering his standing
considerably.
