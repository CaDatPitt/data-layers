SCSTa1ks of
Fines, Rally
And Queen

During the last few’minutes
of the Student Congress meet-
ing Monday, representatives
discussed the Friday parking
situation. Students have been
protesting the ten—do1lar ﬁnes
which they received for park-
ing violations prior to the Euch-
arist rally at Forbes Field held
Friday night.

. SC agreed to draw up a resolu-
tion which would be presented to
the Public Relations Board since
it was felt that more could be
accomplished if the situation is
handled by a University adminis-
trative group. The document
would'be a formal protest against

"tagging student autos throughout V
the day and urging that ﬁnes be V

cancelled.
V Queen to be Entered

Congress voted to enter a beau-
ty queen in the Kentucky All-
American City Basketball Tourn-
ament this December. Any organ-
ization may submit a- picture of a
candidate; individuals may also
enter the contest.

SC Assemblies chairman Tony
Arabia, Col. ’58, announced that a,
tentative victory rally has been
scheduled for after the Navy
game. Pep rallies are being planned
for the Nebraska game, the Miami
contest (a night rally), and ‘the
West Virginia battle.

Blood Drive Planned _

But in order to hold any -cele-
bration in connection with football
games, it is necessary to have the
full cooperation of the students,
the solon chairman emphasized.
He stated that the “Damage Rally”
pact last year, made between .city
schools, must be enforced; there-

fore. students will not be per-
mitted to celebrate off campus
grounds. ’ '

SC also voted at a busy opening
meeting to participate in an ‘all-
school blood drive which will be
staged in cooperation with me

Panthers Out To Sink
Navy. Ship at Baltimore

By STEVE

BUTCHOCK

. Riding the high seas of football success, Navy’s Middies
Wlll be out to sink the_ Panthers into the football doldrums
for the second straight week when the two elevens clash in
Baltimore’_s Municipal Stadium, Saturday, at 3:00 p.m.

Coach Eddie Erdelatz referred to last year’s squad as a

“Team Named Desire.”

They justiﬁed his conﬁdence by

posting a 7-2 slate in regular season competition and then
walloped Mississippi in the Sugare , . .

Bowl. One of the losses was dish-
ed out by the Blue and Gold by a
21-19 count.

Although 18 lettermen, includ-
ing ﬁve regulars, have departed
the scene, the Middies still have
quarterback George Welsh and
All-American end Ron Beagle.-

The passing combination has
been nothing short of excellent
this season as the Midshipmen
have whitewas-hed William‘ &
Mary and South Carolina in their
only two starts.

Welsh showed that inclement
weather doesn’t hamper his throw-
ing the ball as he completed 12 of
19 aerials in a steady drizzle
against the Gamecocks. This is the
duo that the Michclosenmen will
have to contain if they hope to
shipwreck the Midshipmen.

The Middies’ attack is similar to
Oklahoma’s in that they use the
split-T with much variation in
their selection of offensive plays.
They have a relatively light team
but ofiset this by their use of
quick openers and a wide open
style of play that is crowd—pIeas-
mg.

Dr. Charles B. Nutting, vice
chancellor and chairman of the
Committee on Educational Ex-

program on general international
and intercultural interests. The
program is based on the present
Nationality Rooms Program under
the leadership of Mrs. Ruth Craw-
ford Mitchell, director of the Na-
tionality Room Progrhm.

Professor Louis W. H. Johnston
will succeed Mrs. Mitchell as ex-

she may devote full time to the
new program. .

Talk ‘Deutsch’

Don thought food is an import-
ant characteristic of any foreign
country. He said Americans could
eat cheaply—75 cents for a steak
dinner—-in German‘ restaurants.
But Don preferred Mother
Burckle’s delicious home cooking.
He said the reason why German I
cooking is so good is that the Ger-
man mother spends her afternoons
in the kitchen. “There are no af-
ternoon bridge parties.”

Sunday was a special day for the
voyager and Familie Burckle. They
would drive through the country-
side singing folk songs and enjoy-

Don visited high school with

at the informal atmosphere _in the
classroom. He expected to ﬁnd a
strict “authoritarian teacher.” He
also found" surprisingly that “fash-
ions don’t play a part in school.”
Students don’t dwell on wearing

Black Forest of Germany. “Nature
-was our host” is the way Don de-
scribed their Sunday picnics. “Na-
ture plays a big part in their lives.
They love to take long walks.”
Enjoyed Nature

The ten Americans and ten Ger-
mans in the Experiment group
from Stuttgart, also enjoyed na-
ture. They toured the surrounding
area in’ their own Omnibus be-
tween Aug.-4-27.

They visited Munich, Germany;
Salzburg and Innsbruck, Austria;
and Uberlinger, Switzerland. Af-
ter the experiment ended, Don and
a friend continued their sightsee-
ing. At Lucerne, Switzerland,
they ent skiing. in August.
“Switze land impressed me most
as far as scenery goes,” Don said.

They toured the Italian Lake
area, Padua, Venice,_ and Rome. At
Rome the two boys gave an old
vendor of Parker ’51 pens a real
shock. When he approached what
he thought were obviously Ameri-W
cans, the boys -told him in German
they- didn’t understand English. He
wast shocked, Don said, because
Europeans “can always tell Amer-
icans.” , _

After four days at Nice on the
French Riviera and a few days in
Paris and London Pitt’s' scholar-
ship winner sailed £6’ Quebec and

ﬂew back, to tell his Pittsburgh

The scientist said ‘that he
has developed “a nu-mber of vac-
cine preparations” which seem to
carry more power than those polio
shots which are now being given.

Same Type _Serum .

‘Schools where the new experi-
ment shots will be tested have not
yet been named. The type of vac-
cine to be tested is basically the
same as the onenow in use.

Salk reported that some of
the preparations to be tested
contain different strains of dead
nolio virus than those used in
the licensed product.

For the experiment,_a drop of
blood will be taken from' each
child’s, -ﬁnger to determine the
amount of neutral immunity he
possesses.

Children with no immunity will
receive two doses of an experi-
mental vaccine. A thirnbleful of
blood also will be drawn‘ from an
arm vein at the time of each such

Salk wants to find out which
preparation produces the most
immunity after a -single shot and

 According to the English history books Llewellyn is
_'1‘eCOI'ded as the last Welsh prince. The Midshipmen from
Navylinsist, however, that their 1955 football team has a
».-"Welsh prince named George. The football history books are
,,fast conﬁrming their claim that this George Welsh is a real

-prince of a player./

The Royal Quarterbackcommands the respect of his

mates ‘and skipper as a master-9

._at calling plays,” says Coach Ed-
die Erdelatz. He’s the same. type of
‘genius as Pitt’svCorny Salveterra,
though. You never know what to

that way as he adds. “You never
'-know what George is going to do
because he has the nerve to do‘
anything. Our players believe in
"George. When he calls a play,
,~they’re sure it’s right.”
 The Annapolis "Senior is one
nobleman who leads his men. in-
to battle as well as calling their
strategy. He completed 47 1
passes in 95 attempts last year
‘for 603 yards and eight‘ touch-
downs. The 164‘-pound letter-
»man also averaged 3.9 yards
 rushing. _

will The Panther  
Bounce Back?

By GENE AROMATORIO
Sports Editor

av?

It’s pretty hard for

 

any football team to be up week after

‘week but this is precisely what is required of John Michelo-

I.

sen’s gridders with the schedule they face. With only one
real breather on the entire card, the Panthers are forced to
have remarkable recuperative powers If they hope to avoid

heavy losses. .
This is especially true right now when the Panthers

 must be at a peak in desire if thy hope to regain their bal-

ance and get back on'the honeyed path to victory. Another
loss this weekend could send the Panthers into a losing sp1_n
from which they might have a hard time regaining their
balance. . .

At least one observer is wondering if last week’s loss was
enough to discourage the Panthers into losing a few more. Sure
they were up for Oklahoma and they thought they could win.
So did the coaching staff and so did some of the fans. But they
didn’t and the game is over with the better team, on that par-
ticular day at least, coming out on top. » ’

Now, what is bothering some Panther followers, this
one in particular, is, did last week’s loss sting Pitt enough
to prevent their comi_ng back strong against Navy this Sat:
urday, or did it not leave any ill effects on the Panther spirit
and attitude‘? If the Panther»; have not picked up their spirits
by now they know what will come from the Navy.

Navy has been billed as the Team Named Desire. How

, true this term applies to the Middies is not sure.‘ One thing

is sure though; the Middies want to beat Pitt this Saturday
just about as bad as they want to beat the Army every year.
Last year the Pittites put the only real blemish on the Navy
record when they toppled them, 21-19, at the Stadium. The only
other blemish’ was not really a blemish at all but was actually a
shiny ‘medal on the Navy slate. We’re speaking of their 6-0 loss
to Notre Dame. This can hardly be'considered_ a bad mark for the
Middies since any team that holds "the Irish to six points is ﬁg-
. ured to be the next thing to a stone wall.

Thus it’s easy to see why the sailor boys want to clobber
the humble~Panthers. In their mind, lowly Pitt had no busi-
ness beating them last year. Hadn’t Southern Cal, Minne-
sota, and Notre Dame just ﬁnished wiping their feet on Pitt?
To be defeated by Pitt at that time was akin to the executive’s
daughter running off with the poor man’s son. The humilia-

‘tionwas just too much to bear. A

After the game was over last year we strained our
eardrums trying to hear one bit of praise tossed Pitt’s way

\ by‘ any Middie delegates. Instead of hearing, “Well you cer-

, when Welsh and Beagle hook up.

tainly played a ﬁne game,” all we could get from the Navy
representatives was, “Boy we played a lousy game today. .I
never saw us play that bad.” ..

We felt‘so bad for the Navy that We were going to start
apologizing for Pitt because they had been uncouth enough to whip,
them. And, oh my! we almost forgot. The wailing losers com-
plained that those Pitt football players actually swore -during
the game. Oh!,’ this will never do. All the Navy players say,
“Gee Whiz,” when they get hurt. Either that or, “Oh dear, my
nose has been broken.” . .

‘, Well, there’s no greater joy than beating a poor loser.
The Panthers are deﬁnitely capable of knocking the tar out of
the over-rated glamour boys from Annapolis but whether
they can shake off last week’s loss in time to do it is not sure.

Pitt ‘has been able to come back in the second half each

time. Will they be able to come back in the second week?

Soccer Team Opens Schedule

With 9-0 Win Over Teachers

Coach Leo. Bemis’s booters got off to a much easier start
then expected yesterday as they outclassed Indiana State
Teachers College, 9-0. This was the greatest number of goals

' tallied by the Bemismen in one game in varsity competition.

Although Indiana State had already had two matches

letter winners, they proved no
match for the fast moving Pan-
thers. With an attack based on
speed, the Pittites rolled up three
ﬁrst quarter goals, two in the
second, three more in the third,
and a ﬁnal marker in the fourth.
Jerry Bressanelli, at inside
right, was the offensive standout
sending home four goals. Karl
Sheil with two and Jahil Janna,
Bob Cherry; and Sammy Hazou
with one each rounded out the
scoring, Bemis began substitut-
ing freely and at the end had al-
ternated almost three full teams.

One consolation“ that the Jungle
Cats received from the Sooner
game was they escaped without
any serious injuries although
minor bruises were sustained by
tackle Herman Canil, quarterback
Pete Neft, and halfback Dick

Canil suffered a sprained knee
but is expected to take to the ﬁeld
against the Naval Academy when
the opening whistle sounds. The
