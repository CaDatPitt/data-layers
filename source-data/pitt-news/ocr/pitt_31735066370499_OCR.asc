Greeks net $53,000
1,400 pints of blood

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

“This year's Greek Week might just
be the best ever." That's what Bridget
Guernsey, assistant director of Student
Activities. told Greek Week co-
chairman Chris Dancu. This year,
Pitt’s Greeks and their friends have
given blood and collected money like
never before.

According to Dancu. fraternity and
sorority members have collected more
than $53,000 for “Helping Hand." a
charity set up to help Pittsburgh‘s
needy residents.

“Our goal was $00000. but lht‘
weather hurt us." said Dancu. “Pitts-
burgh's economic crunch didn't help
either."

Dancu said Pitt‘s Greeks netted some
1.400 pints of blood. “Ours is the
largest and most successful blood drive
in the city of Pittsburgh." he stated.

Productive blood drives are nothing
new at Pitt. Last year. Greeks came to
the Central Blood Bank‘s rescue with

1.200 pints.

"We were told we singlehandedly
got the Blood Bank out of a critical
shortage," Dancu stated. “An AIDS
scare had set in and contributions had
sharply decreased."

This year's increased successes,
Dancu pointed out, are the result of

hard work and a new approach.

“ 1986's Greek Week is different in
that there was much less rivalry and
much more unitv than ever before,“ he
said.

Guernsey attributes this year‘s prog-
ress to other factors as_ well.
“Overall,“ she said. "the coordinators
and their committees perfonned excel-
lently. Also. almost all fraternities and
sororities participated this year. not just
a few."

In past years. students have been ap-
prehensive about giving blood -
especially during the AIDS scare. Ac-
cording to Guernsey, “Though this
year, as in the past. donors have
nothing to worry about.

“The Central Blood Bank is really
well-infomied,” she said. “Donors are
checked extensively for possible infec-
tions or diseases."

Pitt prof examines
desegregation issue

By Lori Grandillo
For The Pitt News

Segregation has been exposed as a
serious ﬂaw in the fabric of our socie-
ty and. despite the existence of
desegregation laws. the problem still
exists. In fact. desegregation in our
school systems has manifested further
problems.

However, Dr. Ogle B. Duff, direc-
tor of the Race Desegregation
Assistance Center at Pitt, along with
several other leading specialists in the
ﬁeld of education, has attempted to
eliminate discrimination among deseg-
regated students in our school systems.

Duff attended West Virginia College
and Institute, Marshall University in
West Virginia and later received a doc-
torate degree in education from Pitt.
She now works with educators and pro-
fessionals to help them deal with
students who have been placed in
special education programs.

“A disproportionate percentage of
minority students have been placed in"
special education programs," said
Duff. “Unfortunately. once these
minority children have been segregated
into these programs, they are usually
kept in them until they get out of
school." Once these students have been
placed in special education programs,

Supercomputer due

The Cray X/ MP 48 supercomputer.
recently funded for the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center by the National
Science Foundation. arrived on Mon-
day. March 24 at 8 a.m. at the
Westinghouse Nuclear Center in
Monroeville.

Engineers and technicians from Cray
Research. Inc. and Westinghouse
began moving the $20 million super-
computer off the truck around 8:30
a.m. It took approximately one hour to
maneuver the ﬁve-ton machine from
the loading dock through the building
into the Westinghouse Energy Systems

computer center.

Once in the computer center. techni-
cians took great care in positioning the
supercomputer into place. For several
weeks. workmen have been preparing
for the Cray‘s arrival by installing the
electrical. cooling and other computer
systems required to meet the supercom-
puter‘s enormous operational needs.
Part of that preparation has included
cutting holes in the ﬂoor to critical
tolerances to allow precise connection
of the supercomputer to its support
systems. The objective is to position the

supercomputer correctly — the first
time.

Generations come together in new video

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

A group of youths and teenagers is
sitting with a group of older people.
They are sharing pictures and talking
about their pasts. A teenage boy and
an older woman get up and begin to act
out improvisational roles. The scene is
very intense. It is about death and how
to deal with it. The woman does not
think the boy understands the pain that
death brings. Finally, the boy begins
to cry and the two embrace.

The scene is part of a 28-minute
video, “The Best of You  The Best
of Me," designed to stimulate the
development of intergenerational pro-
grams in Pennsylvania. On March 20,
Pitt’s Generations Together program

along with Mellon Bank hosted the
Pittsburgh premiere of the videotape.
Representatives from schools, service
groups, day-care centers and a variety
of other organizations were present.

Charles Lyons, development ofﬁcer
for Pitt's Generations Together, a part
of the university's center for social and
urban research, said the video serves
many purposes.

“The message of the video is first
to introduce people to the concept of
intergenerational programs,” said
Lyons. “It is also used to motivate peo-
ple to consider how the programs may
generate in their own specific com-
munity or business. Also, the video
suggests to people the variety of ways
that the old and young may be brought
together in a mutually beneﬁcial way,’ ’
continued Lyons. .

The video portrayed these messages
by showing different programs and

situations that served to bring youth and‘

the elderly together. Three of the pro-
grams in the video were developed by
Pitt’s Generations Together, which
came to the university in 1979. The
program is one of only three in-
tergenerational programs located at col-
leges and universities in the United
States.

“We try to start programs in the
community," said Lyons. “After we
leave, we get the community agencies
to continue the programs. We also
research how the youth and the elder-
ly respond to the programs. Our ﬁnal
objective is to disseminate information
about the programs through publica-
tions, research reports, speaking to
community groups and a variety of

other ways.”

The video is now the new tool of
communication being used to get the
message across. At the beginning of the
video, Ginny Thomburgh, wife of
Gov. Richard Thomburgh said, “How
sad that we tend to separate the elder-
ly from the young, creating in children
the misinformation and stereotypes
about the elderly. Here in Pittsburgh
we have created programs that foster
respect and communication.”

The video then proceeded to show a
variety of intergenerational programs.
At the Messiah Village in Harrisburg,
children from the day-care center are
paired with elderly residents as special
friends, and they visit them at their
apartments each week. Mary
Eshelman, founder of the program,

U.S., Libya
clash in
Sidra Gulf

Libya (UPI) -— Libyan forces ﬁred
on American vessels operating in the
Gulf of Sidra Monday morning,
prompting U.S. retaliation.

Libya initiated the hostilities when it
ﬁred two surface-to-air missiles at U.S.
warplanes ﬂying routine exercises in
the area just before 8 a.m. The Libyaiis
then ﬁred four more missiles at U.S.
vessels around 1 p.m. and incurred a
U.S. response.

American warplanes from the carrier
Saratoga then launched attacks on a
Libyan patrol boat operating on the so-
called Libyan “line of death“ at 32
degrees 30 minutes north latitude. The
Libyan patrol ship was sunk. Further
attacks by U.S. forces resulted in
severe damage to a second patrol boat
and a missile base. Libya claimed to
have shot down three American air-
craft. but no losses were reported by

the carrier ﬂeet operating near the Gulf _

of Sidra.

Early Tuesday morning Libya
retaliated and ﬁred six more missiles
at U.S. forces and missed again.
American planes and ships then at-
tacked Libyan missile sites for a second
time and claimed a second patrol boat
and a corvette, a ship that normally car-
ries a crew of 70. The corvette was

reported “dead in the water and on I

ﬁre" after two A-6 planes from the car-
riers Coral Sea and Saratoga ﬁred on
it early yesterday morning. The USS
Yorktown, a cruiser operating with the
ﬂeet, destroyed a second patrol boat
with a ship-to-ship missile because the
Libyan vessel “was preparing to attack
our forces."

. The missiles used by the Libyans
were Soviet‘-made SAM-2 and SAM-5,
and it is unknown whether Soviet per-
sonnel were manning them when the
United States attacked the batteries on
the coast near the city of Sirte. Libya
vows it will continue to confront U.S.
forces that cross the “line of death,”
and Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy

has put his military on full alert and has .

supposedly begun organizing “suicide
squads” to assassinate American “ex-
perts and consultants" throughout the
Arab world. U.S. maneuvers are
scheduled to take place through April
I.

World reactions to the clash were
varied. West Germany expressed con-
cern and hopes the ﬁghting will not
escalate. The Soviet Union said the
ﬁghting was triggered by what it calls
“provocative maneuvers” by U.S.
forces off the Libyan coast. In a report
carried by the news agency Tass,
Moscow repeated claims by both sides
but said the action ‘ ‘violated all norms
of international law” and accused the
United States of international
“piracy.“

Iran’s foreign ministry stated that
Iran will use all of its resources to‘sup-
port Libya against what it called U.S.
“aggressions and wickedness.” The
statement carried by Iran’s ofﬁcial
news agency said Washington must
back down or face a Moslem war. The
Syrian vice president was reported to
have ﬂown to Tripoli for talks with
Khadafy as Syria and Libya are close-
ly tied in the Middle East.

well as their peers.

Although she cannot explain exact-
ly why such a high percentage of
minority students. especially black
children. have been put into special
edtication classes. Duff suggests that
desegregation itself could be a factor.
"These minority children tnust exper-
ience the cultural shock of desegrega-
tion twice. First. they are physically
moved to a whole new school system,
then once inside the new school, they
must adjust to that whole new environ-
ment," she said. “Many times there
is a cultural difference between the
minority student and his teacher. Quite
often when a teacher is disciplining a
minority student he or she does not
realize that, culturally, this child has
been disrupted from his environment

said. “This is the most wonderful thing
that I've ever been in. The younger
children and the elderly need each
other." I

In another program, the elderly help
at the day—care center. Audrey and
Ruth Evans live in a Kingston senior
citizen high-rise. and they work at the
Kiddyspace Day Care Center, which is
adjacent to the high—rise.

“I lost my son five years ago. and
this son of takes the place of him."
Evans said in the video. “I‘d be lost
without the kids here."

Evelyn Gorbst of the Child Develop-
ment Council said the program has
been more successful than they had
originally anticipated. “We treat the
elderly as employees. They have skills.
so why should we put them aside?“
said Gorbst.

There are also programs where the
elderly can volunteer in schools. One
school that does this is the East Hills
Elementary School in Pittsburgh. “The
program works because of the exper-
tise the senior citizens have and because
of the time they can give to the
students,“ said a teacher in the video.

In Western Pennsylvania, Genera-
tions Together tries to provide the
guidance and support that enables
school systems to build their own in-
tergenerational programs.

“We have a systematic recruiting
process." said Lyons. “We also train
individuals to make sure that they are
qualified and to let them see if they
would like the work.”

The video also shows the program
at the Eastern Area School for children
with special needs. where Mark and
Dorcas Narr are volunteers.

“It‘s an experience that I never could
have imagined." said Mark Narr. “It
brings so much reward to know that a
human being needs help and that you
have the opportunity to help."

Another program in the video takes
place at the Philadelphia Center for the
Elderly. There, a group of teens and
elderly are brought together by Tem-
ple University’s Institute on Aging.
The program is called Full Circle, a
theater troupe that uses improvisations
and intense scene work to bring their
emotions to the surface. They try to in-
crease their understanding across the
ages by dealing with death. grief and
a variety of other subjects.

The video also showed Pittsburgh’s
Youth in Service to Elders program.
Larr_v Davis was the student in the
video. which shows him visiting with

Sam Greensburg said he gets a lot
out of the visit. too. “I look at the
walls; there‘re pictures on the walls all
right, but pictures don't do me any
good. I like the real stuff,” he said.

Lyons said they have about 40 stu-
dent volunteers for the Youth in Ser-
vice to Elders program. He said the
students get four hours of training.
They learn the procedural components

and is not actually being disruptive.“
lio deal with the problem of
dcsegrcgatcd minority students in
special education classes, Du if has
made use of a technique known as the
Cognitive Modifiability Program.
Introduced to Duff and her associates
about three years ago, cognitive
modifiability was developed by lecturer
and researcher Dr. Reuven Feuerstein.
The program is revolutionary because
it encourages the student to learn how
to think independently and recognizes
the potential of each student, instead of
simply placing that child into another
indifferent classroom. “In this pro-
gram. each student is given a test call-
ed the Learning Potential Assessment
Device. As opposed to the standard IQ
test, which only measures what the stu-
dent already knows. the LPAD assesses
the future potential and capabilities of

the student. Once the student‘s learn-
ing potential is understood. it is never
too late for teachers and psychologists
to work together with the student in
completing the Cognitive Modifiabili—
ty Program," explained Duff.

Although cognitive modifiability has
been criticized. especially by those who
believe in the validity of the standard
IQ test, Duff sees great potential in this
program.

Feuerstein has already initiated his
program in Israeli schools —— the results
have been encouraging. He has helped
children from many different countries
throughout Asia, Africa and Europe by
using this program. He has taught these
children how to think independently
while respecting their cultural
differences.

The topic of cognitive modiﬁability
was discussed at a lecture by Feuerstein

of the program as well as ways to deal
with the elderly person. They also learn
about unpleasant situations that could
arise.

Through means such as the video,
Lyons hopes to increase public
awareness of intergenerational pro-
grams. He also has ideas for new pro-
grams to be used by Generations
Together.

“We are now looking into a special

project for persons 55 and over. where
they will be trained in child care and
child development,” said Lyons. “At
the end of the program they will be
aides who have special training. We are
also looking into a home-based pro-
gram for Allegheny County Youth and
Services. The elderly could work with
children with special needs. They can
be role—model parents. It‘s a preven-
tive program for families in crisis.

Spring Break

The Academic Calendar Review Committee, a
group appointed last spring to examine the univer-
sity's calendar, is considering the insertion of a
week-long spring break during the winter term. We
encourage the committee to approve a calendar
which includes a spring break.

A break would give students a chance to catch
up on studies, relax or even take a vacation to
Florida or some other spring break hot spot. As it
stands now, the winter term schedule provides
students no opportunity to take a break for any
length of time. The fall semester has a natural break
in Thanksgiving vacation which affords students the
opportunity to prepare themselves for upcoming
ﬁnal exams. The winter term has no such luxury.
The calendar from January through April is a gruel-
ing one for both students and faculty, and the burden
of a full load of classes would be eased by a week
off.

It appears to us that there are no real drawbacks
to a spring break, provided the university keeps the
remainder of its schedule unchanged. Pitt is finished
with classes well ahead of other universities due to
the fact that we have no spring break at present and
are off only three weeks at Christmas. To extend
the winter term one week would not, as some have
suggested, impair students’ chances of landing sum-
mer jobs.

We would be home one week later, to be sure,
but other area schools would still be in session.
Rather than a three-week jump on other universities,
we would have, say, a two—week head start on sum-
mer jobs. It is time for a spring break at Pitt.

Police
Correct

I have a few comments in response
to Aisha Rice’s Letter to the Editor on
Police Harassment, (The Pitt News,
March 10).

Being a witness to the events in
Hillman Library on the evening of
March 6 and having read her article,
I felt that there was no need for her to
make any comparisons between the
way police in South Africa and police
in America deal with black people. She
may not realize how many problems
the Campus Police have to deal with,
even in a library. Did she really know
that her “boyfriend“ had spent quite
some time in the library doing nothing,
distracting a number of patrons? These
patrons were the ones who complained

to the Campus Police. and it was not
the fact that he looked “suspiciously
black.”

Why did she not let him answer the
policemen's questions‘? Why did she
have to jump in?

Name Witheld Upon Request

‘ ‘Word Salad’ ’

James M. Crary’s piece “Save the
Humans" (The Pitt News, March 17).
is a logically incoherent word salad that
would not be worth commenting on
save for one particularly absurd con-
tradiction: the objectivist
utilitarian assertion.  " This fantastic

formulation alone is sufficient to prove.

that:

1. Mr. Crary lacks even the most
rudimentary understanding of both ob-
jectivist and utilitarian ethics.

Letters to the Editor:

2. Mr. Crary has no qualms about
commenting in print about that of
which he has absolutely no knowledge.

Oscars Create A Grouch

As a truly dedicated American, I
spent this past Monday night glued to
my television set watching the annual
Academy Awards presentation. I knew
very little about the awards —— and the
movies, for that matter — but I knew
it was my duty as both a citizen and a
journalist to witness yet another ﬂashy
display of Hollywood grandeur. And
besides, everyone else watched it.

Before I go on, though, I must add
that I am writing about the Academy
Awards because I am supposed to.
Judging from the extensive media
coverage this past week, all responsi-
ble media representatives with any ig-
norance at all should report their blind
speculations. Monday night, for in-
stance, “Evening Magazine’s" John
Burnett offered his keen predictions
without seeing the movies. But that’s
OK because he is a media
representative.

Anyhow, I will begin by speculating
that the awards presentation offered
movie stars the chance to wear those
tuxedos and prom gowns which, I
believe, were borrowed from the
“Dynasty" wardrobe. The presenta-
tion also gave each winner the chance
to display his or her mask of emotion
and modesty. Most importantly, win-
ners could show off their masterful
rhetorical skills.

“I'm so honored —— but of course
surprised -— to receive such a lovely

award,” the winner would exclaim,
clinging to that Oscar statue with an
alarming death grip. “And I just want
you to know that I am truly grateful
tonight to all those wonderful people
who really deserve this award more
than I do.” Then, of course, the win-
ner would recite (by memory) a list of
names that would cause even an insom-
niac to fall asleep. Finally, the winner
would dedicate his Oscar to a trendy
social cause.

I think rock star Prince said it best,
though, at an awards presentation last
year. As his name was announced, he
graciously stepped forward, wearing a
pompous costume and accompanied by
a monstrous bodyguard. As he reached
the podium, he stood there, stared
straight into the microphone, took a
deep breath and said, “Thanks. " You
know, if every winner spoke in that
fashion, local television stations
wouldn’t have to postpone the nightly
news until midnight.

Now that I’ve discussed the winners,
I would now like to pose a question or
two about the losing nominees. As the
winners raise those Oscars into the air,
how do the losers feel? Are they real-
ly happy for the winers? I think not.
I would ignorantly speculate that as
they smile and clap and are maintain-
ing that sincere look of joy, they are
saying to themselves, “That should be
me up -there. That dirty S.O.B. is

always getting the awards meant for me
— and he can't even act.” And using
a psychological defense mechanism, he
would curse the Academy and claim
that its members are a bunch of nerds.
That is my speculation.

What is the Academy, anyway? Are
its members merely an elite group of
trained moviegoers? Why don’t they
seek my advice about movies? Ignorant
speculation is what the public wants,
you know.

And I suppose many people ask
themselves, “What is that gold-colored
statue even made of?” With con-
ﬁdence, I would ignorantly speculate
that Oscar is made of either gold, brass,
sculptured ice or chocolate covered
with foil. If that is the case, though,
perhaps a chocolate bunny would be
more appropriate so close to Easter.
And where does the Academy get these
things? Could I purchase an Oscar
trophy at the same place bowling
trophies are sold? Probably not, but I’m
merely an ignorant observer. As a
trendy journalist, that's my job.

Unfortunately, I cannot disclose this
year‘s winners of Academy Awards
because I dozed off before they were
announced. But then again, I never
made any ignorant predictions. That
doesn’t matter, though, because a
multitude of other ignorant media
representatives made predictions and
will release the results. That’s their job
—- that’s news.

Investing In Racism And Terror

As a student or tax-paying employee
of the University of Pittsburgh, you
should know where your money is go-
ing. The board of trustees’ decisions
regarding allocations of tuition or tax
dollars should be of extreme concern
to you. It is rare to invest a significant
amount of money and never evaluate
where that money goes; yet, that's
precisely what you are doing if you
don’t ask two critical questions: Where
is my money going? What are its con-
sequences? In examining these ques-
tions, the crucial focus is that of South
Africa. Our university has approx-
imately $19.6 million in South African-
related investments.

There are three important considera-
tions surrounding the investment issue
and its relationship to you. The first is
the effect that investing or divesting in
the South African regime has on that
nation's blacks. The second considera-
tion regards the current status of Pitt's
investments and the trustees’ position
on divestment. The third consideration
is the students’ role in perpetuating the
regime in South Africa through ig-
norance or apathy. The problem of
apathy is one that only you can address.
This article is an attempt to eradicate
the problem of ignorance.

Investing in South Africa enables the
regime to perpetuate the policies of
apartheid. The statistics are staggering
and frequently outlined. Here are just
a few: There have been over 700
apartheid-related deaths since July
1985. Due to malnutrition or illness,
one out of every four black infants dies
before the age of one. In schools for
blacks, four out of five high school
teachers have not completed high
school themselves. The government
has implemented a forced resettlement
program which has uprooted the lives
of over 3.5 million blacks. Also, blacks
are denied their most basic rights, in-
cluding the right to vote.

U.S. corporate investments support
offenses like these by supporting the
South African government. In addition
to bolstering the South African econ-
omy, speciﬁc corporations provide dif-
ferent mechanisms for institutionaliz-
ing apartheid. IBM exempliﬁes this,
and administration officials said that
Pitt has a sizeable amount of stock in
this company. With computers, IBM
operates in strategic sections of the
economy, and their largest employer is
the South African government. Ford
and General Motors sell vehicles which
are used by the police force and the
military to the South African govern-
ment which is responsible for almost
all of the 700 deaths. Also, some com-
panies are instrumental in assisting the
South African government in develop-
ing its nuclear capability.

While it is apparent that investing has
far-reaching and disasterous impacts,
there is much controversy concering
the effects of divestment. The facts
show that the divestment campaign has
already had a strong impact. John Chet-
tle, a spokesman for the South African
government, warned, “In one respect
at least, the divestment forces have
already won. They have prevented -

" discouraged, dissuaded, whatever you

call it - billions of new U.S. in-
vestments in South Africa." Recently,
the South African government dis-
cussed the possibility that political
prisoner Nelson Mandela rnight be
released. This has not come about as
an act of humanitarianism but has oc-
curred as a response to the economic
pressure exerted by the South African
business community reacting to the
threat of divestment.

Clearly, a policy of divestment is the
only logical course of action. Instead
of divesting, our university has chosen
to invest in companies that subscribe
to the Sullivan Principles. These prin-
ciples call for desegregation in the

workplace and fair employment prac-
tices. However, these companies
employ only 0.4 percent of the black
labor force in South Africa; therefore,
this does not benefit the bulk of those
oppressed by apartheid, nor does it deal
with the basic nature of apartheid. The
fundamental question in South Africa
is not one of housing and jobs but
political power itself. The Sullivan
Principles are thus irrelevant and an-
tagonistic to the struggle.

The inadequacies of the Sullivan
Principles have caused leading
authorities to renounce them as a solu-
tion to apartheid and also as a substitute
for policy. The majority of black
workers has rejected them outright. A
demonstration of this was found when
a Sullivan signatory, the Ford Motor
Company, the largest employer of
black workers in South Africa, asked
its workers what they thought of the
Sullivan Principles. The workers
responded with a hard-hitting four-page
document. They argued that the
Sullivan Principles are a “toothless
package" and a  reform that
allows this cruel system of apartheid to
survive.” This document further stated
that “the codedoesnotdernand apart-
heid to be abolished but merely to
modernize it and ensure its perpetua-
tion."

Many Pitt trustees argue that
divesting would hurt the black South
Africans. However, many black
leaders have expressed their will-
ingness to sacrifice temporary
economic gain in order to obtain per-
manent freedom by asking for divest-
ment. The largest labor force federa-
tion in South Africa's history, the Con-
gress of South African Trade Unions
and the South African Council of
Churches, representing 13 million peo-
ple, have called for divestment.
Recently our own faculty assembly,
representing over 2,000 faculty

members, called for divestment. Also,
over 100 athletes and 2,000 students
have signed a petition demanding
divestment.

Ironically, even Pitt President
Wesley Posvar essentially agreed that
divestment would have little or no im-
pact on the university's rate of return.
Given this, there is virtually no
justification for the university’s con-
tinued refusal to divest. One should
question what motivates the trustees in
maintaining this line.

The only reasons that the board of
trustees refuses to divest are as follows:
As stated earlier, some trustees have
believed that divestment would only
hurt the blacks. Secondly, some are
concerned that the university would
lose large sums of money. However,
this is a fallacy. Robert Zevinn, vice
president of the U.S. Trust Co., has
handled South African free investments
for 17 years. He found the wom possi-
ble case for loss of profits through the
divestment process is less than 1 per-
cent. Also, he foundthat there are more
cases of divestment that have created
proﬁt than those that have lost profit.
Ifthetrusteesdonotagreewiththisin-
formation, Students for a Free South
Africa, a student organization, is
prepared to have the university's in-
vestment report professionally analyzed
by either the U.S. Tnrst Co. or through
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Third-
ly, there are many board of trustees
members who truly have a lack of
knowledge about South Africa and
divestment. This is inexcusable con-
sidering that lives are at stake. Another
important reason is that many trustees
either work for or are on the board of
directors of one or more companies
who do business in South Africa. Also,
along the same lines, because of
solidarity, some trustees feel that it
would be unfair to punish these com-
panies doing business in South Africa

, ~‘ ' Page 3

by divesting, regardless of the reper-
cussions that investing causes. Even
though there is truth in these
statements, it is unethical for our
trustees to concentrate on their own
personal concerns rather than the con-
cerns of a nation of people. Finally,
many board members are fearful to
take a stand against their fellow
trustees, many of whom hold very
prestigious positions.

Divestment is the best instrument to
bring about change with the least
amount of violence. Investing
strengthens the apartheid regime.
Fonner South African Prime Minister
John Vorster accurately proclaimed
that “each trade agreement, each bank

I loan, eachnew investment is another
*‘ brickjn the wall of ‘our continued ex-

istence. ” Nobel Peace Prize recipient
Bishop Desmond Tutu stated, “For-
eign companies in South Africa should

. stop kidding themselves by saying they

are here for our beneﬁt. That’s
baloney. Whether they like it or not,
they are buttressing an evil system.”
We need to abandon our arrogant,
paternalistic attitude that “we know
what is best for them" and listen to the
people of South Africa.

It is time to take a stand. Refuse to
let your university beneﬁt from this ex-
ploitation of black South Africans.
Unless the university breaks its rela-
tionship with the South African govern-
ment, blood will be on its hands.
Unless you do your part to influence
the university’s decision, the blood will
be on your hands as well.

The Pitt News would like to
thank Typecraft for their
assistance in our time of
need. As usual, they were
there for us.

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

Nathan Singer is 70 years old, single
and now retired. He was a taxi driver

L for 14 years and before that he worked

for the federal government. Like many
retired men, he enjoys doing odd jobs
around his home, and when he is in
good health, he takes mile-long walks.
However, once a week for three hours,
he becomes more than just another
retired member of the community.

Singer is enrolled in a senior seminar
in ﬁction writing at Pitt, and on Tues-
day nights he comes out of retirement
and moves into the college ranks. But
why would a 70-year-old, ex-taxi
driver brave the anxiety and work of
a senior-level writing course? For him,
the answer is simple.

“I had the time and leisure to get
back to study,“ said Singer. “And, I'm
a believer in study. I believe the mind
should not be left alone to get rested
—- it should be used all the time."

Singer is just one of 290 older peo-
ple registered in Pitt's College of
General Studies Over 60 Program. The
program. which was created in l974.
offers a wide variety of high-level
courses. Most courses are in liberal
arts. writing. business and political
sciciicc. but other courses are axziilable.

doors of the Hyatt Regency Hotel. A
misty D.C. welcome didn‘t stop the
hurried-harried preparations for the
start of the 17th Annual Student Sym-
posium, March 14-16, sponsored by
the Center for the Study of the
Presidency.

The center annually invites a number
of universities to send representatives
to attend the series of lectures and
discussion groups. Because this year's
topic was “National Security Policy,"
the event could have become a
weekend-long endorsement of Presi-
dent Reagan’s policy in Nicaragua.

Some of it was. But not all.

Although the program hosted a
substantial share of administration
names, including Attorney General Ed-
win Meese III and Chairman of the

According to Jan White, the director
of the Over 60 Program, the reasons
for attending classes are as varied as
the students themselves.

“Most of the people taking classes
are retired and looking for something
to do," said White. “They see it as a
learning experience. They can take ad-
vanced courses and bizarre courses,
like Darwinism, and now and then
some of them even enroll in graduate
courses.

“There is no pressure on the
students, because they don’t get grad-
ed in the class, and they can enjoy the
subject matter without worrying about
passing the classes.”

Singer decided to return to school not
only for the learning experience, but
for a more practical reason. At one
time in his life, he had several of his
writings published — a few short
stories and some poems — and he
wanted to return to his old hobby.

"Basically I came back to school to
stimulate my mind to go really at the
writing which I have neglected for
years,” said Singer. “Here and there
I’ll write up something and maybe get
it published. The last thing I had
published years ago was a poem, and
I never knew I had any talents toward
the writing of poetry."

Since then, Singer had taken several
advanced poetry courses at Pitt and has

‘started a book of poetry.

“I have started a book of poetry, but
in sort of an unusual style, because it
tells a story in various, separate poems
that will all be connected," he said.
“One that is completed is my impres-
sions during World War II, and the im-
pression I got during one particular
night of all the people milling about in
Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus
and just recalling how I felt. It was a
perfect experience that was a mixture
of inebriation, self-pity and disgust at
war, and those feelings jelled into one
poem." ‘

Betty Tarantino had a different rea-
son for returning to school. She is in
her mid-50s and quite active in the
university. Tarantino’s return to col-
lege was a career move. She works in
the Department of Theater Ans as
department administrator and under-
gradiiatc niaior adxisoi‘.

Exemplifying this give-and-take W218
"Congressional-Presidential Relations:
The War Powers Resolution,“ one of
l l discussion groups offered. After the
opening remarks of the three panel
members, it seemed that the scale had
been tipped in favor of the resolution,
with both Peter Raven-Hansen (Pro-
fessor of Law, George Washington
University) and Michael Reopel (Assis-
tant Professor of Social Sciences, U.S.
Military Academy) presenting credible
support.

The third panelist, L. Peter Shultz
(Assistant Professor of Politics,
Catholic University of America), loud-
ly expressed his distaste for presiden-
tial restraint, however, and attempted
to dominate the discourse with this
view. Whereas Raven-Hansen and

been doing more and more of it, not
only for my job, but because I serve
on a communications panel on the Staff
Association Council," she said. “As
president of the Women’s Association
at the university, I prepare newsletters
so I do things that require some
writing: and I feel because I enjoy it,
I might as well take some writing
classes."

Reopel reorganized an effective
counterattack. They stressed that the
War Powers Resolution, rather than
serving as a check on the president‘s
power to defend the country, instead
restrains him from continuing a war for
a long period of time. Although the
rebuttal did not serve to quiet Shultz,
it did expose some gaps in his logic.

The highlight of the weekend,
however, may well have been Sunday’s
concluding panel, “The Media and Na-
tional Security Policy,” featuring
David R. Gergen (Managing Editor,
U.S. News and World Report) and An-
drea Mitchell (White House Cor-
respondent, NBC News). Once again,
listeners were presented with per-
suasive arguments; in this case the issue
focused on the beneﬁts and problems

classes at night. Both her writing
classes were day courses in the College
of Arts and Sciences. For Tarantino,
this has not been a problem.

“I guess one of the things I have
thought was that in the daytime classes,
where the students are younger than
when I was taking some nighttime
classes, there might be some distance
or resentment but there has not been."
she said. “Thc_v‘vc been very friendly

In another light, however, she em-
phasized that the press was not always
praiseworthy, alluding to the coverage
of the Iranian hostage crisis. ‘ ‘We came
unfortunately close to participating in
the story rather than covering it,” she
said. The press loses its importance,
she felt, ‘ ‘when we are no longer open-
ing a window into the formulation of
foreign policy.”

Gergen also praised television:
“Foreign policy, because of the
pressure of television, has become
much more democratized." Like
Mitchell, he saw this form of media as

by students,” he said. “I took acourse
in poetry writing, and I found I wzs
very much accepted by the students,
because at the end of the course they
asked me if I was coming back next
year, and I said yes. Age is no bar-
rier." -

Although both Singer and Tarantino
have had no problems with the student
body. they both have experienced prob-
lems with the univcrsity‘s faculty. They
stressed. ll()\\‘L‘\L‘!’. that the incidents

assumption that tclexision was a
remedy for an uninformed public.
“The problem in the age of TV." he
said, “is that it doesn’t  truly help
people to understand what’s going on
in the world.” He said that in a case
like Nicaragua, a representative may
not be able to vote the wishes of his
constituency because many people
aren't even informed about the policy
in question. “By and large, the public
opinion is not well-formed,” he
remarked.

Although there was a fair amount of
pro-adrninistration rhetoric, the discus-
sion groups and the closing panel ef-
fectively balanced the weekend. By
presenting speakers willing to examine
the many sides of an issue, the sym-
posium provided an interesting political
experience.

“Teachers have treated me very
good,” said Singer. “Only once have
I had a bad experience, a very bad ex-
perience. It was something of a prob-
Iem outside of class that I’d rather not
get into. This particular instructor is no
longer with the university and I handled
the situation as best I could."

“Generally the teachers have not
been a problem toward me,” said
Tarantino. “There have been times
when I thought, well, at least one
teacher might have felt intimidated by
me. No matter how I tried. I couldn’t
develop a good relationship with that
person.“

According to White. who has been
with CGS’ Over 60 Program for five
years. problems between students and
professors have been few. In her live
years, she has had to field only live
complaints.

“I've had very few complaints," she
said. “Most of the professors are very
willing to have older people in their
classes.

“There have been few problems be-
tween students and teachers. Most of
them come from the students‘ falling
asleep in class." said White. "When
you get older you tend to fall asleep
more often. and some of those night
classes are very long.

“Also. some students have spoken
too much and disrupted class, or
spoken during class. and the professors
won’t allow these students back in class
the following temi. But those incidents
are rare."

There are problems. though. and
Mariolina Salvatori. a professor of
literature of aging. said it can be traced

back to the difference in age. Many of
the students just do not accept learn-
ing from a younger person.

“I have never had any problems with
older students in my class,” Salvatori
said. “But some of my students feel
that since they are older and have more
life experience, rather than book ex-
perience that the teacher might have,
that they might know more. That has
not happened in my class. I have
nothing but admiration for older peo-
ple coming back to school.”

Singer feels that questioning the pro-
fessor’s knowledge is natural for older
students.

"I think this is a normal reaction
many tithes." said Singer. "You get
that feeling about all the instructors. but
you have to weigh what he really
knows with what he doesn’t know.
because this question enters your mind.
Not everybody knows everything about
a subject."

"Having a young teacher doesn't
bother me as long as I feel the person
is competent." said Tarantino. “And
most of the ones I've had have been
competent —- with a few exceptions.
That can be discouraging if you get in
with somebody that you feel is not do-
ing the job."

Although there have been some stu-
dent/teacher problems. Tarantino feels
the advantages of taking classes
outweigh the disadvantages. In fact.
Tarantino's husband. Louis. has also
been taking courses at Pitt.

“It‘s been only in the last few years
that the staff has gotten the benefit of
the spouse tuition break and so my hus-
band wanted to take some classes at
Pitt." said Tarantino. “My husband
taught years ago and he wanted to get

 

back into teaching. He is now taking
language courses, because it is his best
subject and he loves it.”

Louis plans on getting his teaching
certiﬁcate in the languages, and in the
future, the Tarantinos might write a
book together.

“My husband likes to write too and
we often talked about writing a book
together or maybe even more than
one," said Tarantino. “We’re both
used to being busy and I don't think
either one of us could adjust to a life
of not doing anything.

“Even in retirement, when that
comes. we'll both have plans. He'll
want to get back into teaching and he
also grows grapevines and makes wine.
and I might work at a travel agency.
ldon’t think either one of us are going
to go home and sit and waste our lives
away."

Singer also does not want to waste
his time walking through shopping
malls and thinking about his youth. He
worked as a cab driver and even had
a screenplay accepted by CBS—TV in
the mid—‘60s; he is not one to rest.

“I'm retired and I have all the time
in the world, and I don‘t believe in not
studying." said Singer. “I’m reminded
of a remark that an excellent artist in
Florida said to me a few years ago.

“She was 68 at the time and she said.
‘I‘m always learning.‘ She said age is
no barrier to learning and that remark
always stuck with me._

“I'm here to study. to learn. and
there's always something new that you
can learn. From the time you‘re born
to the time you die — what is life‘? Life
is a learning process and I don't care
how old you are or what it is you learn;
at least you're learning something."

When I think of Easter, my mind
conjures up images of eggs and bun-
nies. I can remember as a child going
on Easter-egg hunts with my sisters and
brothers; when we found the eggs we
were rewarded with Easter baskets,
filled to the brim with chocolate can-
dy. I also think of Easter Sunday and
watching the little children solemnly
carry their Easter lilies in a procession
around the church. I think of the Easter
cake shaped like a lamb and all the
other food that goes along with Easter
dimer. Probably most of you have fond
memories of Easter, but if you’re like
me you probably didn't know about the
symbolism and meaning behind our
Easter traditions.

The story of Easter has evolved from
an array of traditions and legends.
Many rituals are performed throughout
the Easter season to celebrate the resur-
rection of Christ and many symbols of
spring are also representative of the
rebirth.

When traced back to its roots in the
languages of Europe, “Easter” refers
to the season of the Rising Sun or the
Dawn. Most of the nations of Europe
refer to Easter as Pasch, a Greek term
derived from Hebrew, meaning Pass-
over. This important feast in the Jewish
calendar was celebrated in a tribute of
homage to God for the deliverance of
the Israelites on the night prior to their
ﬂight from Egypt. Moses, the leader
of the Israelites. told each Hebrew
family to slay a lamb and paint its blood
on their door frame. This allowed the
Israelites to be passed over, to be
spared from the plague that killed the
first—born of every household.

The lamb was chosen because the
Egyptians worshipped the ram, and the
Israelites wanted to show their disap-
proval of such idolatry. Following the
sacriﬁce of the lamb, it was then
roasted and eaten, along with unleav-

 

 

ened bread and herbs. This became an , .

annual ceremony of . the Jewish people,
and Christ participated" in this cere-
mony the night before his crucifixion.
Hence, the lamb of the Hebrew peo-
ple became the Christians’ symbol of
Christ.

Did you ever notice that Easter falls
on a different date each year? The idea
of timing the date so that it would oc-

i ‘ I '»
cur at the same time annually has been
discussed, but so far the method of
determining Easter has remained the
same over the past 1,600 years.

Early Christians decided that Easter
would be observed on the first Sunday
following the full moon that occurs on
or near March 21. The Council of
Nicaea. which resulted from a meeting
of the astronomers of Alexandria under
the archbishop of that city, set the
method of calculating Easter’s date in
325 A . D.

The first Easter service is believed
to have been offered by a group of
Spaniards exploring North America on
Easter Sunday in 1609. In 1773, Mora-
vians who settled in North Carolina
gathered several hours before daybreak
to give the salutation “The Lord is
Risen," opening their service. This

 

custom has continued over the ages to
the present time.

Today, millions of Americans greet
Easter with sunrise services. Cadillac
Mountain in Mt. Desert Island, Maine,
is where the sun first touches the
United States and the first service is
held. Then hundreds of proceeding ser-
vices are held as the dawn moves
westward. The last service on the

.'.“’4/7.7 7''1’/
“r * ‘NuiK\\§\'\

 ‘ 4” ' Q 1, I l‘,

mainland is held in Yosemite National
Park.

The reason for the sunrise service is
that the clearness, beauty and purity of
this particular time is believed to have
an influence on one’s frame of mind,
making the soul more exaulted. In
France, there is an old belief that the
rays of sunlight penetrating the clouds
on Easter morning are angels dancing
for joy at the resurrection.

On Easter morning of March 27,
1513, Ponce de Leon sighted the land
that he named Florida, from the
Spanish Pasqua Florida. These words
mean Palm Sunday. the day that marks
the last day of Lent and the beginning
of Holy Week. Over the years, palm
leaves have been distributed in Chris-
tian churches on Palm Sunday. The
palm leaves are also used in Passover

Florida. At the top of the tree is the ter-
minal bud, on which its growth relies.
It is from this point that the bud yields
a golden spray between four and six
feet long, which we receive on Palm
Sunday. , '

We can’t talk about Easter without
mentioning the Easter Bunny, con-
tributed to American Folklore by the
Pennsylvania Dutch. .

This custom was introduced by Ger-
man settlers who arrived in the colonies
in the 1700s. The children prepared a
nest for the Easter Bunny, or Oschter
Haws, as they called him. They made
sure to put the nest in a secluded place
because the rabbit was shy.

It was more than a century later
before the English, Quakers and Scots-
Irish people accepted the rabbit,
because many considered it to be un-
truthful to tell the children stories. They
felt that it held no symbolic meaning
in the Easter story. But the rabbit's bur-
row is a dark hole in the ground, like
the tomb of Christ. They both rise from
their tombs, representing our bodies as
they shall arise on the Last Day.

Also in folklore various plants and
flowers hold a symbolic role in the
celebration of Easter. In Palestine, the
wild rose is said to have turned red
from the blood of Christ’s crown of
thorns. In Germany. France and Great
Britain, tradition says that the white
hawthorn was the plant used for
Christ's crown of thorns. The lily of
the valley is believed to have sprung
from the tears of Mary. the mother of
Jesus, when she wept at the foot of the
cross. But this flower is unknown in the
Holy Land. There are many other
ﬂowers associated with the Passion of
Christ.

Of all the folk symbols associated

 rase at 

link rabbitsand  religion“

with Easter, none is more prominent
than the egg. The egg has symbolized

new life and fertility to almost all peo-

ple over the ages. The shell is com-
pared to a tomb, and from this comes
new life. From ancient Egypt and In-
dia the egg was a symbol of the crea-
tion of the world. Hindu culture has the

golden egg, from which all creatures . I

came.

The links between the ancient myths
and Christianity are not easily detected.
Knights of the Crusades may have been
the bearers of the egg folklore. From
all of this, we now have many Easter
uses for the egg.

When the Dutch settled in Amster-
dam, they brought with them many
Easter egg customs. In the 19th cen-
tury, men and children used to chal-
lenge each other to egg-eating contests.
“Picking eggs” was an expression
used by children, meaning to test the
strength of the shells by striking the
ends together. The broken egg was
given to the winner. There is also the
game of rolling hard-boiled eggs down-
hill. This has been done on the lawn
of the White House for over 260 years.

There are also egg hunts and many ‘

other egg games.

Coloring the eggs also became im--
portant over the years. Onion skins
boiled in water with the eggs was one

way to color them. Alder catkins gave ‘

yellow effects, madder root produced
light red and walnut shells made brown
shades. Wrapping eggs in calico made
it possible to transfer patterns. Over the
years the decorating of eggs has be-
come more sophisticated and colorful,
stylish designs refect the quality of folk
art.

The traditions. folklore and customs

of countries around the world have ac- 2

cumulated over the years and are a part
of our hertitage. The ‘Easter symbols
serve as a source of fun and as a
reminder of religious beliefs. So this
year, think about all that Easter really
means. _

  bloom

By Kelly 1. Shaffer

Assistant Features Editor

The calendar says that it is spring,
but it sure doesn’t look or feel like it.
Finals are drawing near, and the home-
work has piled since January and your
dorm room resembles a gopher’s hole
—- claustrophobia reigns. You need to
get away. But where in Oakland can
you go for some color, some warmth

. some spring?

Spring has sprung at Phipps Con-
servatory, just around the corner at
Schenley Park. Admission is $2.

The Spring Flower Show, on display
from March 16 through April 13, is an
annual event at theconservatory W and
a long~awaited one. Over 50.()()()
blooms are on display throughout the
half-mile building. Each section of the

conservatory features different styles of

plants. including 41.500 tulips. a sure
sign of spring.

Walking into the conservatory is like
walking into a technicolor movie. The
air is warm. the smell earthy and the
colors vivid.

From the lobby where you enter. you
walk into the Palm Room; here Hermes
statue greets you, surrounded by lacy
palm plants. Names like the Petticoat
Palm and the Cuban Royal Palm graze
your face as you wander through the

Central America rises gracefully to the
domed ceiling. The room, with its
many high—reaching plants gives you
the feeling of being secluded in ajungle
grove. You can hear the rhythmic slap-
slap of the overhead fans and feel the
moistness ofthe air against your warm
clothing. Small children in their Sun-
day best scamper up and down the
shrouded aisles.

From the central Palm Room, you
enter a hall entitled Exhibition A. Here.
the piped~in music adds to the at-
mosphere as you walk underneath huge
baskets overflowing with Hydrangea
Macrophylla. a vivid outpouring of
floral color. The traditional Easter Li-
ly, in its virginal whiteness. is shown
to its advantage against the dark green
of the exotic Buddhist Palm. Florists
Cineraria from the Canary Islands is
resting next to the bright tulips in red
and yellow bloom. There is a long
center display that the visitor walks
around. with splashing fountains and
pennies glistening in the water.

The next stop on your tour is the Vic-
toria Exhibition Room. A spraying
fountain graces the center ofthis floral
fantasy. The water sparkles as it
catches the rays of the late afternoon
sun through the glass—topped room.
Branches of Shell Ginger reach into the
spray while crystalline droplets of
water create small whirlpools in the
rnan—made stream.

named the Japanese Garden. In the
meandering stream, little glints of gold

far end of the display area can be
glimpsed through the tan—like fronds of
the Japanese Pine Trees. Through the

design of the Japanese Garden, the
visitor goes into culture-shock at the
syininctrical planning of the French

‘Q complete contrast, the next area
is a Desert House. Accordingly, the
focus of horticulture here is the various
forms of cacti. The sun in this arid
room is beating down on a giant
saguaro cactus, that can normally be
seen in the American deserts. The cacti
are as small as your thumb (the Fuzzy
Panda plant) and as large as the
Marginated Century plant, which is
larger than most children who stare in
awe as it creeps down the side of a bank
into the walkway. The names of the
plvﬂts are  varied as their size: the
romantic Heart of Flame cactus or the
brash Golden Barrel cactus. The room
is kept over 80° and it is very dry -
almost dry enough to make it difficult
to breathe. As you wander through the
Sahara-like area, beware of the sharp
cactus spines sticking into the aisles and
unwary walkers. V

Room, you enter the Economic area.
This room is every child’s delight.

captured by time in living color and
plants. The Ugly Duckling hides in the
ferns as the graceful swans glide by on
a glass—like pond. Children and adults
alike are fascinated by the fanciful tales
and the carnivalesque floral fantasy.

The adjoining room, known as the
Modern Room, continues much in the
same fashion. Mrs. Bunny Rabbit,
dustpan in hand, is surrounded by ex-
otic tulips. Mr. Rabbit and Mother
Goose frolic among the Pittosorum
trees, imported from China and Japan.
In the Cottage Room, the Seven
Dwarves whistle as they tote picks and
shovels down the cobblestone paths.
The Wicked Witch is talking to her
mirror, while the unsuspecting Snow
White waits for her diminutive friends
to come home. Lilies, daffodils, Dutch
Irises and hycinths tumble around the
true—to—fairytale figures.’

Exhibition Hall B pays tribute to the
naturalist John Chapman, a.k.a.
Johnny Appleseed. A pampus-plume
wolf chases Little Red Riding Hood
through a forest of startling white lilies
and blood—red tulips. Further along the
path, pretty-as-a-picture Rapunzel lets
down her hair for her handsome prince
who is almost buried in the lilies and
tulips.

On to the Fern Room, which is
overﬂowing with such ferns as the
Bird’s Nest Fern and the Lasagna Fern.

 

The Amaryllis of Greek mythology
fame can been seen ensconced next to
the Cacao tree from tropical America.
The winding paths of the Stove Room
reveal the humid sea of green contain-
ing the likes of the Candlenut tree from
Southeast Asia and Mountain Thistle
from West Africa. In between the
delicate fronds of the extraordinary
ferns can be seen a glimpse of scarlet,
white and deep purple. while a gentle
lily trembles, showing its brush-stroked
red lines.

The best is always saved for last —

the Orchid Room. As you.walk in,

you’re enveloped in the heavy, dead-
sweet scent of orchids that brings back
memories of proms and formal dance
dates. Pots of the tissue-like plants

_dangle from the jungle-type trees.

Names like Kafﬁrlilly and Brasso cat-
taloga belie the fragility of these
beautiful plants.

Entering Phipps Conservatory‘s
Spring Show is like visiting China, the
Mediterranean and France (as well as
storybook forest) within an afternoon’s
time. The visitor is transported across
timelines, oceans and through realities
whilst meandering through the seem-
ingly endless rows of blooming
wonders. To get away from the books,
the cold and Pittsburgh, go to Schenley
Park and visit Phipps Conservatory’s
Spring Flower Show.

The Pitt News, March 26. 1986

Evans will get

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Navy coach Paul Evans will be in-
troduced as the successor to former Pitt
basketball coach Dr. Roy Chipman
early today. according to a source in
the Pitt athletic department. Chipman.
who gave notice of his resignation on
l)ec. l8. effective the end of the
season. will pursue a career outside of
basketball.

Evans. according to The Pitts/mrg/2
PI‘¢'.\‘.\’. was to meet with university of-
ficials yesterday to discuss terms of a
contract. Evans found those terms to
his liking. a source told The Pitt News
last night. and will take over the basket-
ball program immediately. The an-
nouncement is expected to be made by
Dr. Ed Bozik around noon today.

“The basketball coaching situation
has been taken care of." the source
said. “[The selection committee] lik-
ed Paul Evans from the beginning."

Monday. Evans was in Houston
meeting with officials from the Univer-
sity of Houston to talk about the job left
vacant by the retirement of veteran
coach Guy Lewis. Evans. however.
favored Pitt over Houston because of
its location and membership in the Big
East Conference. the source said.

()ut of the three candidates Pitt has
interviewed for the position. Evans is
the only one to be called back for a sec-
ond interview.

South Florida head coach Lee Rose
and former Cleveland Cavaliers head
coach George Karl were also being
considered. Karl was fired two weeks

Sports

ago but was not offered the Pitt. job
because the Pitt selection committee
felt it needed a disciplinarian. Karl did
not give the selection committee that
impression. the source said.

Evans. 41. emerged from the shad-
ows this season as his Navy squad ad-
vanced through conference play to the
NCAA tournament.

Led by 7-ft. center David Robinson.
Navy advanced through the Eastern
Regional until the Midshipmen were
eventually eliminated by top-seeded
Duke 71-50 in the. East final last
Sunday.

Before the loss to Duke. Evans and
the Midshipmen were more than im-
pressive. however. Navy upset Big
East power Syracuse at the Carrier
Dome on the Syracuse campus before
a national television audience. and the
Paul Evans success story received na-
tional notoriety.

His success has not gone unnoticed
by members of the Pitt basketball team
either. Several players. including
sophomore forward Charles Smith and
freshman swingman Jerome Lane.
were quoted in The Press as saying they
were pleased with the choice of Evans.

“Sounds good to me." Smith told
The Press. “He‘s a good coach. and
I can’t go wrong."

"There are some guys on this team
that need disciplined." Lane added.
“Evans will give us that."

Evans spent seven years at St.
Lawrence University before moving on
to Navy. He was I26-5() at St.
Lawrence and 129-60 at Navy.

Pitt athletic department officials
would not offer any comment on Evans
or any of the other candidates yester-
day afternoon.

Chaz Palla/The Pit! News

Discipline is the word at practice

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried

Cha; Palla/The Pitt News

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

There is a new sheriff in town. His
name is Mike Gottfried, and he is lay-
ing down the law. Gottfried. of course,
is the man appointed by this universi-
ty to revive what was a dying football
program. With a record 8-12-2 over the
past two years, turning the program
around does not seem like an easy task,
but by just observing one Pitt spring
practice, one can already see some
small, but noticeable, changes.

Examples:

0 One thing Pitt teams always did
was break a huddle and walk to the line
of scrimmage. You do not see that hap-
pen anymore. “Run to the line of
scrimmage!“ bark the Pitt assistant
coaches time and again in practice.

At one point during Monday after-
noon's practice session, defensive
coordinator John Fox called for the
first-team defense to come onto the
field. When the defense did not enter
the playing field enthusiastically. he
sent the entire unit off and told the
members to come back ready to play.
Needless to say. the unit returned with
a little more enthusiasm the second
time.

0 During practice. the players are

told to keep their helmets on at all
times. In the past, players not par-

ticipating in a scrimmage at practice’

usually spectated on the sidelines with
their helmets off. Not this year.

These examples may not seem very
important, but they are all aimed at one
goal. It is called, simply, discipline.

Many people called Gottfried a
disciplinarian because of the way he
has handled some of the situations his
players have been in this year.

Gottfried dismissed two players,
Dexter Hairston and Tony Williams,
for being involved in campus alterca-
tions and suspended another, sopho-
more tailback Brian Davis, for not
following team guidelines.

Stiff discipline indeed, but coaching
a disciplined team goes much further
than punishing a problem child. Gott-
fried has proven that by instituting the
small things, such as running to the line
of scrimmage. the Pitt program will
have discipline.

The only fear, perhaps. that Gott-
fried had about developing a disciplined
team was how the players would react.

“You know. as a player, when you
come out here that the practices are go-
ing to be different." said Gottfried as
he stood on the turf at Pitt Stadium on
Monday. “Sometimes players walk on
eggs because they do not know what

to expect. It is tougher on the players
than it is on the coaches."

So far, the reaction from the players
to Gottfried‘s disciplined practices has
been very good. The practices have
been very enthusiastic, and the team
concept that Gottfried has spoken so
much about seems to be settling in
gradually. ‘

“They are practicing hard, and they
are having fun," Gottfried said. “That
is a prerequisite if you are going to en-
joy this thing,” Gottfried added con-
fidently. “I think they are enjoying it,
but they are working hard also. They
have some very good work habits out
here."

The results of all this cannot be
measured until next fall when the Pan-
thers take the ﬁeld against what seems
to be a tough schedule. Pitt plays,
among others, Maryland, West
Virginia and Miami at home, and Pur-
due, Notre Dame and Penn State on the
road.

Gottfried cannot promise an
undefeated season, he cannot promise
a winning season. but he will promise
one thing: “We will play hard, we will
play disciplined. and we will play
unselfishly. Those are the only three
things you can ask your players to do
— other things will come later. Win-
ning takes care of itself.“

Pitt .'\ews It} I‘-teen said you are

Pitts most prized reciiiit. and since
quarterback was a major concern for
the team. do you feel any pressure to
succeed?

Genilla — Not really. I just feel the
pressure about getting the job done, just
trying to be the best I can be.

PN — What are the differences
you’ve seen thus far between football
at the junior college level and football
at a major college?

Genilla -— It’s a lot different at Pitt.
This is my first time being involved in
spring ball. In junior college, all we
had [during the spring] were seminars.
The guys here are a lot quicker and a
lot stronger, so that makes me try to
be quicker and faster.

PN — I imagine there are differences
between the receivers here at Pitt and
the receivers you’ve worked with in
junior college?

Genilla — I’m not used to these
quick guys we have here. Back home,
we have guys who ran a 4.8 or 4.7
[40-yard dash], and we ran precise pat-
terns there. I‘m not used to the [Pitt
receivers’) speed yet. There’s a lot of
timing routes we have to throw here,
and I’m always a second or two off.
But they‘re coming along good.

PN -— When you transferred to Pitt
from San Mateo Junior College, you
were probably the odds-on favorite to
start this season. But now that the
NCAA granted last year’s starter, John
Congemi, another year, you'll have
added competition. What were your
immedia . thoughts about Congemi
returning?

Genilla —— I just said hang in there.
I told myself that all the quarterbacks
would start on the same level.
Whatever happened last year is over;
this is l986.‘It's not 1985 anymore.

I hope it‘s that way with him until they
select a No. I quarterback. I‘m not the
coach, so I can’t say whether I'll be
starting. But I feel I‘ll have the oppor-
tunity to start. I’d be a little disap-
pointed [ifl didn’t start], but I'm go-
ing to do whatever it takes to help Pitt.
I’m not here for myself. What I did last
year in junior college, that’s history.
But if I can’t produce here, I'll try to
help the guy in front of me.

PN —— You’ve only practiced a cou-
ple of times, but has Mike Gottfried's
new offense been tough for you to pick
up?

Genilla — It’s a lot of mind-boggling
stuff. There’s a lot of new plays and
coverages. It’s tough for me right now
because I’m trying to learn the plays
and do my physical stuff, and it’s slow-
ing me down. After I get all the men-
tal stuff in me, the physical stuff should
come right away. Right now, I’m pret-
ty rusty. I told my mom last Friday that
I didn't have a very good practice
because of the new offense. She just
said you just have to work harder now.
I didn‘t know what it was going to be
like, how much time or effort I was go-
ing to put into it. Now I do.

PN — You seem to have a good per-
sonal relationship with Gottfried, but
is he the disciplinarian everyone thinks
he is?

Genilla —— Yes, he is. What he's
done with the ﬁve or six players proves
that. I heard it’s going to be a lot dif-
ferent than last year or the year before.
I don’t know what happened then, but
[Gottfried's] just trying to bring Pitt up
to the tradition it had when Hugh
Green, Tony Dorsett and Dan Marino
were here.

lense what attracted you to Pitt in the
first place?

Genilla --~ That was the major fac-
tor in picking Pitt over Tennessee. Ten-
nessee was my original choice. but
when Coach Gottfried came to Pitt, I
changed my mind. The relationship
between the coaches and players here
is great. I can’t go home on holidays,
so they take me in as their own kid.
They make me feel right at home when
I might otherwise feel homesick. But
it’s big-time football here. There's
always a chance to win the national
championship at Pitt. You hear about
Tony Dorsett, Dan Marino, Greg
Meisner 

PN c You mentioned Dan Marino.
Wasn't he a personal favorite of yours
when you were growing up?

Genllla — I‘ve always liked Dan
Marino. When I play quarterback, I try
to put Dan Marino, Joe Montana and
John Elway into one. Danny White is
my idol, I try to idolize him. Even last
year I went out to take a picture with
him at summer camp.

PN ~ Why didn't you go to a major
college following high school‘?

Genilla — I really wasn't recruited
after high school. I got all these big-
time letters and I thought I was going
to a major college right off the bat. But
when it didn’t work out, junior college
coach Tom Martinez told me, “You
come with rrie for two years and you'll
be at a four-year school." He said,
“I’ll do the best I  And he's done
it because out of high school I didn't
know anything about defensive fronts
and coverages. All I did in high school

PRECISION HAIRCUT 

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

The Pitt baseball team will be back
on the road this week as they open the
Big East season at Georgetown. The
Panthers, who are 1-6 this season, play
the Hoyas in a double-header on Thurs-
day and then a single game on
Saturday.

The Hoyas, who are 2-8 after their
Florida swing, will be worthy op-
ponents for the Panthers. Last season,
the Hoyas led the series 4-2. Matt
Lepnew is currently Georgetown’s
leading hitter with a .533 batting
average after eight games.

The Panthers annual Florida swing
was not all sunshine. The trip opened
in Panama City in the Gulf Coast
league where Pitt defeated Brooklyn
College 7-2. After that, it was
downhill. Tennessw Tech took a 7-2
decision from Pitt and then a hard-
hitting Bradley team won 10-1.

It was then on to Tallahassee to take
on the Florida State Seminoles, rank-
ed No. l by ESPN. Florida State swept
the Panthers in four games with a com-
bined score of 56-4, proving why they
are tops. -

It will take a lot of work for the Pan-
thers to bounce back from their tough
start, but they certainly have the talent
to do so.

Leading the way for Pitt is left ﬁelder
Brian Lohman. After seven games, the
sophomore from Mt. Lebanon has a
team high .409 batting average and is
also the leader with five doubles. He
has made one home run this season,
which came in a 7-2 loss against Ten-
nessee Tech. Another strong performer
has been center ﬁelder Matt Stennett
of Shaler. Last year’s All-Big East
selection has a .318 batting average
with three doubles and one home run.

John Brush, a catcher who trans-

ferred to Pitt from CCAC-South, has
done an excellent job of filling Chris
Jelic’s shoes. Jelic was the Panthers‘
top catcher last season and signed with
the Kansas City Royals. In addition to
his strong defensive play, Brush has
compiled a .308 batting average in five
games. He had the winning RBI in the
Panthers’ victory over Brooklyn.

Others who performed well for the
Panthers, both at the plate and in the
ﬁeld, were Bill Osborn at third, Dave
Westwood at ﬁrst, Don Fausnaught at
second and Gregg Lamanti at
shortstop.

Osborn provided some slick ﬁelding,
making plays that made even Seminole
fans take notice. He completed the trip
with a .267 batting average and one
RBI. Westwood had a .250 average
with one double, one RBI and two
stolen bases, while Fausnaught had a
.222 batting average with two doubles,
two RBIs and one stolen base.

Coach Bobby Lewis also got strong
performances out of some of the Pan-
thers’ newcomers. Freshman Jay
Duderstadt started three games for the
Panthers against Florida State. While
his batting average was only .125, his
good defensive play and strong arm
were a deﬁnite plus for the team. Junior
transfer Alan Popa got his turn at sec-
ondbaseandturnedinsomerealdefen-
sive gems. He was 1-3 at the plate for
a .333 average and an RBI. Freshman
MikeClauswasalso 1-3andwastough
at shortstop. Junior Rich Deiley saw
playing time at third and managed to
cool down the hot corner. Offensively
he was 1-5 for a .200 batting average.

One of the disappointments for the
Panthers was their pitching. Pitt gave
up 75 runs in seven games and 64 of
them were earned. The team earned
run average is 9.53.

After a strong start against Brooklyn
College, where he threw a one-hitter,

The"Pi'tt News; M‘ar¢ii"z6, “i9’s 

opens Big East season

senior Frank Craska gave up nine
earned runs against Florida State in two
innings, bringing his ERA up to 12.80
and his record for the season to 1-1.
The other Panther starters did not have
it any easier. In two outings, senior
Mike Shannon gave up 15 earned runs
with an ERA of 11.25. He leads the
time in strikeouts with 8. Junior Keith
Shuster ﬁnished with a 7.00 ERA in
one outing and sophomore Rich
Lowman had a 14.00 ERA after two
outings.

Coming on strong on the mound for
the Panthers was starter Rich Gavran.
Despite getting the loss in the Panthers’
second game against the Seminoles,
Gavran gave up only three earned runs
in six innings for a 3.50 ERA.

Providing relief for the Panthers’
staff was Dave Kleindl, who in two
games gave up four earned runs for a
7.00 ERA. Freshman Frank
Merigliano also appeared twice, both
times against Florida State. He did not
show any ﬁrst-time jitters as he retired
the side in his first outing. In his sec-
ond appearance he gave up four earned
runs with a 7.65 ERA. Freshman John
Carroll threw two innings against
Bradley and gave up two earned runs
for a 7.00 ERA, while another
freshman, Eric Sanberg, pitched two
innings against Florida State, giving up
ﬁve earned runs.

While the statistics might look bad
for the Panthers, there is one thing that
mustbekeptinmind: Thiswastheﬁrst
time the Panthers had played outdoors.
While Florida State was working its
way to a 26-2 record, the Panthers
were spending time in the ﬁeld house
batting cages. Who knows, maybe next
year Bobby Lewis will be able to work
out a deal with Seminoles coach Mike
Martin. Can you see it - Pitt vs.
Florida State -- at Fitzgerald Field
House?

-Spring   practices going well

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther spring football
season kicked off last Friday afternoon
with the annual media luncheon at Pitt
Stadium.

Starting with Friday's practice, new
head coach Mike Gottfried and his nine
assistant coaches will have 16 practice
sessions and two intrasquad games this
spring season. The Panthers will play
their annual beneﬁt football game at
Belle Vernon High School on April 1 1,
with the game’s proceeds going to the
Mon Valley YMCA. The players will
get a break from workouts during the
week of April 14-22 for ﬁnal examina-
tions and then come back for four more
practices and conclude the spring with
the Blue-Gold game at the stadium on
April 28.

Gottfried has been a very busy man
since Dec. 12 when he was named head
coach, but now he will be able to do
what he does best: coach football.
Spring practice gives Gottfried time to
get acquainted with his players, and the
new coach is very clear on what he
wants to accomplish.

“We want the players to come out
of spring with an understanding of
what’s expected of them,” said Gott-
fried. ‘‘I hope to come out of spring

with a No. I player at every position.
We want to concentrate on three areas
-— offense. defense and special teams."

Gottfried also indicated that he would
like to have one complete game under
his belt before camp concludes, and he
didn't necessarily mean the two intra-
squad games that Pitt has scheduled.
“It may not be the final scrimmage but
a scrimmage in between where we can
get an idea of what everybody is do-
ing," said Gottfried. “We want to get
the timing down on when everyone
should be in their places, whether that
is in the press box or on the ﬁeld."

The expectation to win at Pitt has

always been high. and Gottfried is
aware of that. but he doesn't promise
any number of wins. He only assured
the media that Pitt will be a first-class,
hard-working team. “We want to in-
crease our work ethic. You can only
ask your team to do three things."
commented Gottfried. “Play hard, play
disciplined and play unselﬁshly. If we
do that. the wins will take care of
themselves.“

With luck, the Panthers will indeed
blend into a disciplined, cohesive, win-
ning football team this fall. They had
better; because that is the only way
Mike Gottfried will have it.

Captain. Webster‘s defines it as one
who leads, commands or guides.
University of Pittsburgh baseball Coach
Bobby Lewis agrees with that deﬁni-
tion. He even adds to it.

“You have to be a role model,"
Lewis said. “You have to set a good
example."

If you asked Lewis for a synonym
for captain he would have no trouble
coming up with one. His answer -
Don Fausnaught.

“Donnie exemplifies what you ex-
pect from your captain," Lewis said.
“He is the perfect role model."

Don Fausnaught is certainly worthy
of being the Panthers‘ captain. The sec-
ond baseman from Danville, Pa., has
those special qualities you look for
when you need a leader.

He knows when he is supposed to
speak up, and he does so. He knows
when things are better left unsaid, and
he remains quiet. When a teammate
needs a pat on the back. his hand is

there. Whether the team is up by live
or down by Ill, you (till he sure he is
the one you will lIt‘.'Il iloiiiiz the

IIIIILII it llielxers,

"l)omiie goes the team izreiit
moraile," Lewis .s'.iid. “He is iIlWiI}5
plugging the other guys. He is someone

the freshmen can look to for advice."

Fausnaught earned his role as cap-
tain. He did so by being a substitute last
year and by winning the starting job at
second this season. So far, he has per-
fonned strong defensively, and offen-
sively has a .222 batting average after
seven games with two doubles, two
RBIs and one stolen base. Fausnaught‘s
plans, though, are to get better.

“I would really like to lead the team
in hitting," Fausnaught said. “I want

they should have lun when they do.“

In the I984 seasoii, Faiisntiuglit got
a ehanee and had fun with it. He led
the team in batting with a 1.000
average. He was one for one with a
double.

“I did that once before," Fausnaught
said, srriiling. “In high school I led my
team with a l.0()0 average going one
for one. Not many guys can say they
batted 1.000 in both high school and
college.“

While his leadership is seen through
baseball, it can also be viewed through
his academics. He is a first year den-
tal student and works quite hard in the
classroom.

“It can be time consuming,"
Fausnaught said. “As soon as you
ﬁnish one thing, there is something else
to do. Coach has been very under-
standing with my schedule. My pro-
fessors have also been understanding.
You don’t make it to dental school if
you don't deserve it, and they know
that."

And. you don’t make it to captain if
you don't deserve it —- and the Pitt
baseball team knows that.

Alter lt;t\ mg lost 9-0 last spring.
the upvand-coming I’ztnther.s tell
that they had a point to prove. Un-
fortunately. the squad was not as
potent as they would have liked to
have been without the services of
usual No. 3 player Dave Johnson,
who injured his left ankle in a
challenge match last week. Johnson
currently carries the team’s best in-
dividual singles record.

Avoiding any excuses for the
loss, Coach George Dieffenbach
did, however, manage to stress the
importance of Johnson's absence.

“It hurts us especially at the bot-
tom of the lineup,” said Dieffen-
bach. "We're just not as deep
without him."

The match was not as much of a
cakewalk as the Scots’ players
seemed to think it might have been,
though. Some indicated, in fact,
that they were “just out toenjoy the
sunshine.“ But Edinboro coach
George Viercom knew better.

“I had heard that they [Pitt] were
much stronger than last year," said
Viercorn. “The match was

definitely competitive. When you
look til the scores. there were eer
t'.iinl_\ no Iilowoiits “

The teatiired muteh between No.
I players Jell Dadowski oi" Pitt and
highly touted Tim Sabherwal of
Edinboro was not as competitive.
with Sabherwal prevailing in
straight sets 6-0, 6-4.

As a result, the Panthers were
able to take a little more relaxed ap-
proach to their doubles play, and
some exciting, high-quality action
was the result. All three matches
saw barrages of thundering
overheads and fast-paced volleys,
accompanied by frantic com-
munication between partners.

Pitt's No. 2 team ofGreg Camp-
bell and Rich Monteleone closed
out their opponents in a third-set
tiebreaker by a 7-1 margin;
however, the Panthers’ No. 1 team
of Dadowski and Meyerowich
dropped their third set 6-4 to
Sabherwal and Mark Minichelli
after splitting the first two in
tiebreakers.

The Panthers will head back in-
to action tomorrow against cross-

Matt Peters ends successful career at Pitt

After four years of hard work, Pitt gymnast Matt
Peters ends his career.

Chaz Palla/The Pitt ‘News

By Shelly Ranius
For The Pitt News

Robert Frost knew. It is the road that
we choose and the way that we travel
that road that makes all the difference.

Matt Peters knows. He has traveled
this road for four years — a long way
from his hometown of Apollo, Pa. Not
a long span when measured against a
lifetime. Just the period in which boys
claim their place in the world as men.
The passage ends and the man moves
on. The memories remain.

It has been a long and rewarding
journey.

The senior eo—captain of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh men‘s gymnastics
team will soon reach the end of this,
his road. The course has been a rocky
one, a new adventure. “I’m tired,”
said Peters. “But it is a good kind of
tired."

During his sojourn at Pitt, the con-
quests have been much more numerous
than the defeats. fwo trips to NCAA
competition, attaining All-East status

for two consecutive years and a Pan
thers” record on the high bar are
counted among the victories. A
diploma from Pitt will be perhaps the
most rewarding conquest of all.

“I know that I won‘t be competing
in gymnastics for the rest of my life."
Peters said. “For that reason. you have
to use the sport to develop who you are.

“I do new routines and try new tricks
to prove to myself that I can do them.
Once I know that 1 can. that‘s what is
important. I don‘t feel that 1 have to
continually prove myself to everyone
else."

Peters has also found challenges in
the air to complement those he faces

on the ground. The challenge of

skydiving has become as exhilarating
to him as mastering a new routine. lt
is the beginning of the end of his road
through Pitt. And a continuation of the
lessons learned here.

“The first time 1 went skydiving I
thought I was going to die," Peters said
with a smile. “You learn a lot about
yourself when you stand at the door-
way of the plane getting ready for the

“it is really hard to describe what it
feels like. You are in total awe. lt‘sjust
an incredible feeling. 1 think 1 would
like tojoin a club and take up skydiving
more seriously."

Along with skydiving, Peters has
made plans for future challenges that
will require the use of his mental as
well as physical abilities to achieve new
goals. Pursuing an MBA is the next
hurdle for the information science
major .

And the road so long traveled is
rapidly coming to an end. A changing
of the old for the new. A search for
more successes using P’ the lessons
learned on the passage through Pitt.
The glories won in the classroom and
in the gym will be remembered by
Peters.

It has, indeed, been a long and
rewarding journey.
