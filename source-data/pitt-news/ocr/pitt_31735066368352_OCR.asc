as the project's coordinator, said

Although abortion is a
heated issue in America today,
it may not be a deciding factor
in elections, according to Cyn-
thia Deitch, a Pitt sociologist.

Deitch spoke on “The Poli-
tics of Abortion” at the Oak-
land Women's Center on
Wednesday. She also said that
the government should remove
itself from any legislation
regarding abortion.

Deitch used two examples of
candidates whose campaigns
were not affected by their posi-
tions on abortions. Dick Clark,
who was defeated in 1978, ‘was

personal victory. However,
there were many factors
involved in his defeat, she said.

Secondly, Pennsylvania's
Ruth'Rudy, who was also pro-
choice, won her campaign “due
to the fact that she was oppos-
ing a candidate who was strictly
anti-abortion,” Deitch said.

Deitch strongly opposes any
governmental interference,
such as placing the issue in the
constitution.

“It’s necessary to keep the
government out of people's pri-
vate life,” she said. “The issue
should be kept within the fam-
ily, and no congressman should
have the right to decide." _

A throughout the area.

The Thornburgh administra-
tion will award four grants to qual-
ified universities V in February.
These grants, or “seed” money,
must be matched by a sponsor from
industries, foundations or federal
government outlets.

“By having industrial support, it
will bring science and industry
together in a more applied vein,”
Fishersaid.

When the Ben Franklin project

was first proposed by the Thorn-

burgh administration, both Pitt
and CMU showed much interest.
“It was a question of whether we
would fight or band together,”
Fisher said. Thus, in order to
secure the state grant, Pitt and
_CMU decided to become partners,
rather than compete against each
other for the same funds.

The Mellon/Pitt/Carnegie Cor-

poration (MPC) was sought out to_

help organize_this joint venture.

The MPC is a corporation whose -
. sole purpose is to facilitate cooper-

ative efforts between the two_euni-
versities and the Mellon Institute.

This corporation is composed of
eight directors—four each from
Pitt and CMU. Each year, the chair’
position rotates between the uni-
versities. Pitt's provost Rhoten

Smith is presently the acting

chairman.
Fisher said that CMU has
already made plans to renovate a

The Board of Trustees unani-
mously approved a resolution on
Tuesday to establish an indepen-
dent corporation to conduct coal
research projects for government
and industry.

Also passed was a resolution
authorizing officers of the univer-
sity to borrow funds through the
Allegheny County Higher Educa-
tion Building Authority
(ACHEBA) to finance the frater-

’ nity housing project and assure the

completion of renovation ‘projects.
Included in these projects are the
renovation of the stadium and field
house. The university is seeking to
borrow up to $15 million from
ACHEBA which now provides a
tax exempt means to borrow funds.

The non-profit corporation with
which Pitt is now affiliated will be
an asset to the university because of

technological center. This center,
which both universities will have
access to,‘ is tentatively named the
Western Pennsylvania Technolog-
ical Center. ’ '

On Feb. 10-11, the Thornburgh
administration will vote on which
of the seven applicants are worthy
of receiving the seed money. Fisher
speculated that the Pitt-CMU pro-
gram has a very good chance of
receiving the funds because “we are
the only applicant in the Western
Pennsylvania region.” a

The Ben Franklin Project will

cal year ($250,000 to be awarded to
each school).

“There is a ceiling ofa quarter of
a million for the first year,” Fisher
said, “but word is the governor will
ask for $10 million after its initial
year." .

Thornburgh has pledged that
the technological center program
will continue at least through the
1986 fiscal year. At that time, Fisher

found to be in “good shape." BCR

nal problems, acording to
Freeman. ‘ .

Fisher emphasized that in order
to qualify for the technological
program, each school's funds must‘
be matched. “Part of the process is
review boards," Fisher explained.
“Each board will have pressure to

-see that our funds will be matched

by industrial contributions."

The Pitt-CMU portion will be
contributed through the “Univer-
sity’s Resource for the80s”—a cap-
ital campaign to the Center for
Applied Science and Technology
and the Surface Science Center.

Many area industries "have

  Reagan’s Half-Year Mark:   What Grade?

ey RAY WUSLICH

Two years ago this week,
Ronald Reagan was sworn in as
the 40th president of the United
States. g His victory over incum-
bent Jimmy Carter indicated a
conservative- swing in American
politics.

During this time, Reagan's life :

ley, he took a hard-line approach
with striking air trafﬁc controllers
and he initiated his Caribbean
Basin initiative to help the econo-
miés of Latin American countries
to improve.

Reaganomics also became a

_ household word because of his

ability to inﬂuence the media and
Congress. Reaganomics also
had an effect abroad, upsetting
members of the European eco-

nomic community because the
high American interest rates
which hurt their economies. _

Perhaps his most controversial
and most publicized stance dealt
with his increase of the defense
budget and the tough line he
took with the Soviet Union.

To celebrate Reagan's half-
way mark, several Pitt professors
were asked to grade his perfor-
mance to date. , 1

Soviet-American relations

have deteriorated as a result of-
Reagan’s policies, according to.

political science professor Cole
Blasier. »

“Tensions _have increased,"
Blasier said. “We are waiting to

see if there will_be some changes,
but there has been no important
reversal yet." \
According to Blasier "the
changes’ that Reagan has intro
duced in our relations with the
Soviets have been against the
interests of the United States,"
and he added that “we need to
improve our arms control agree-

 
   
  
 
  
  
 
 
   
   

ments with the Soviet Union."

On the domestic side, the
effects ‘of Reagan’s economic
programs are a mixture of good
and bad. Unemployment lines
and cutback in areas of social
benefits have been widely
publicized.

Reuben Slesinger
Economics Dept.

Evaluating Reaganomics is a
complex question, according to
professor of econmics Reuben
Slesinger. V

"Reagan's basic theoretic
approach is good,"Slesinger
said. “It is his application which is
poor."

Slesinger sees the positive
aspects of Reaganomics in the

Ronald Reagan an "F" on his

rights.

“His performance has been
very poor,” Penny said. "He has

Unreliable  
Standards

The National Collegiate Ath-letic Associa-
tion (NCAA) recently came out in favor of tight-
ening academic standards for freshmen
athletes. Although the move’ counters the
serious problem of exploitation, it is nothing
more than an attempt to show the public that
“hey, the NCAA thinks that academics are
important too.”

The ruling, which will go into effect in 1986,
stipulates that a freshman will need SAT scores
of 700 or ACT scores of 15 before he can gain
admission into organized sports. Fine, but this
standard is an arbitrary political move that has
been labelled rascist. ,

Point: White males who score above the 700
mark number around 89 percent, while only 60
percent of blacks score above it. Within the last

10 years, the only scores to decrease were from _ '

the white sector, dropping an average of 20

.. points in English and Math. Blacks, on the’

other hand, have scored higher in this 10 year
span.

Several black-college presidents" have come
out against the ruling and said that the stand-,
ards upon which these tests are based are
“unreliable” and “culturally biased in favor of
upper-class whites.”

Penn State football coach Joe Paterno was
recently quoted as saying, “We’ve told black
kids who bounce balls, run around tracks, and
catch touchdown passes that that is an end in
itself. We've raped a whole generation of black
students. We can’t afford .to. do it again}?
(Chronicle of Higher Education, Jan. 19, 1983)

Controversial statements like this have been
flying since the NCAA»decision was made and it

is unfortunate that this has been reduced to a.

racial issue.
‘ It is more than that. l

Admittedly, more needs to be done to see that .

academic requirements are met, but randomly
selecting a number out of the sky, as the NCAA
did, is not the way. Black colleges have charged
that this method is unfair to blacks because, by
the latest estimates, approximately 90 percent
of their students would fail to meet these
standards. - , K .

_ The NCAA should rely less on “heat of the

I moment” decisions to set their standard and

analyze the problem as it stands. Their ruling is

little more than a quick fix for a deep problem. I

N CAA:Wracked With Problems  

By MARK A. SINDLER

Verbal warfare broke out in San
Diego last week when the represen-
tatives from Division I schools
covened for the annual NCAA
gathering. Phase I of the battle has
already ended with more possibly
in store. .

At issue was the more than 2-1
passinggin favor of the NCAA’s

issuing stricter academic standards '

for students competing in intercol-
legiate athletics. The new rules-—
including the regulation that
incoming students have a high
school GP_A _of 2.0 and complete at
least 11 courses in English (3),

mathematics (2) and sciences (4)'—" A

were bitterly opposed by many
black university presidents.

The debate centers not on the
‘aforementioned regiment but on

the stipulation that all freshmen,

obtain a score of at least 700 on the
SAT or 15 on the ACT. The dis-
senting black presidents quickly
labelled this guideline as racist and
anticipate a sharp decline in the
number of blacks on teams of
schools carrying major athletic
programs. ,
Therein lies the dilemma. It is
not that the uproar is over the pass-

ing of stricter standards, but over a.

college entrance examination. Not
only last week, but in years past,
many minority representatives

‘ have spoken out against the bias

the SAT poses
students.

The point carries with it valid
merit. The Scholastic Aptitude
Test is prepared in favor of upper
class whites, as North Carolina A 8:
T chancellor Edward B. Fort
recently pointed out. A number of
blacks enter universities from pub-
lic school systems, a majority of-
which do not attract productive

to minority

, ._TDo BAD Hes BAlI7rl'l€l7I‘1AKEA NICE SCALFIN‘

classroom instructors. As a result,
blacks“ performances on the SAT
show the lack of rigidity displayed
in the classroom. College board
statistics show that the average
combined score for blacks is 707.

The lowest a student can score is
400. _ g

It is a poor reflection _on this
university-rich society when presi-
dents and Chancellors with docto-
rates must stoop so low as to
require a 700 score. It's even more

degrading when some of those’

same officials start crying over
what they believe is an unreachable
goal"

This is not to say that blacks do
not deserve to attend college
because they do no meet some pres-
cribed standard. What needs to be

__ done is to devise a better system

under which ‘high schools are
tested for college eligibility. In
short, it’s high time that the SAT

_ when the way of the Edsel and the

carrier pigeon.

Still, black students who do not
attain 700 or 15 on the respective
exams, can still attend the univer-
sity of their choicebut cannot com-
pete during the first year. It is
believed that high schools do not
adequately ‘prepare students for
college-level ‘work and that col-
leges themselves only demand that
students take remedial-type classes.

This may be true, it may not be.
The real solution-to this academic
flare-up can be found in outlawing
freshman eligibility altogether.
Instead of four, collegiate athletes
can better adjust to college rigamo-
rales by hitting the books, instead
of the boards, during the freshman
year. Three years is time enough
for many a memorable experience.

Afterall, this whole flap was
created over several new guidelines
that people knew were necessary so
that the integrity of their institu-
tions was preserved. If this is sin-
cerely the case, then the thought of

  

no freshman eligibility would
seem like a desirable route to take.
Unfortunately, since intercolle-
giate athletics are big, big business,
many will fail to see any truth in
the possibility of sacrificing huge
TV profits when shelving fresh-
man eligibility. I

Besides freshman eligibility,
another point of interest emerging
from the NCAA convention was
Joe’ Paterno’s remarks over blacks’
becoming victims of crime. In part,
he said, “For- the past 15 years we
have had a race problem...we’ve
told black kids who bounce balls-
...that that_is an end unto itself.
We’ve raped a whole generation of
black students. We can’t afford to
do -it again-...."

Undoubtedly, Paterno carries
some very strong convictions. But

why single out the athlete? Why is’

the athlete so special or so deserv-
ing of attention that he must be put
under academic guidelines? Why
isn’t the band? Where are the cheer-
leaders? Or why isn't the entire stu-
dent body required to attain certain
academic goals before it can

4_ attend?

The answer is clear. The same
administrators who believe that it
is time to improve or uphold their
school's integrity hold a double
standard. They do not want their
coveted’ athletes to fall victim to

j classes such as Car Washing I01.

Yet, without realizing it, it doesn’t
matter how the rest of the student
population does because that pop-

ulation does not have to attain‘

minimum requirements.

There have to be better answers

to the problems that were _ _
addressed by the NCAA last week.
The one answer that must be
avoided is the thought of some
black universities’ dropping out of
the NCAA in protest. That would
be the sign of a cop-out.

Afterall, the mind is a terrible
thing to waste.

More Profound Contradictions

,. Dear Editor:

Many may not find the topic of
the war in El Salvador an impor-
tant one, and needless to say the
student body as a whole can not be
expected to understand the com-
plexities of that tiny, turbulant
country in Central America.

I read with interest Jose Correal's
article “Salvador Violence" in the
Jan. 17, I983 issue of The Pitt News

'_ and felt compelled to relate the
‘ topic of El Salvadorto campus life

here at -Pitt.

. .While it may be difficult to 1

imagine how such a small country
in Central America could come to
influence the students at Pitt, let us
consider some interrelated matters.
The situation in El Salvador, and
in that volatile region in general,
has had, and continues to have, a
significant impact on American
foreign policy and our interna-
tional relations. President Reagan
and former Secretary of State Al
I-Iaig, early on in the history of this

_ administration, “drew the lines

against international‘ (comm u-

nism" in El Salvador; Sy'_‘steiiiziti-  I‘

,..~,_';.. ~ ~ -

cally, they opted for a military
solution in a country with pro-
found social and economic, as well
as political contradictions.

While I want to refrain frm.
repeating what Mr. Correal said. it
is important to note that the situa-
tion in El Salvador has deteriorated
in recent weeks. Beginning with a
mutiny within the armed services
and culminating in new gains by
the leftist opposition, there has
been a rapid internal polarization

_)Opinion  

A

I

Dear Edi tor:

A letter to the editor by Ms.
Ann Marie Freggens (Sociology
'33) published in the Jan. I2 Pitt
News contains so many inaccu-
rate assumptions and conclu-
sions that I feel compelled to set
the record straight.

She first states that students
may not realize the biasing fac-
tors in their, judgments of
teachers ""'i.e. the professor...
might be teaching a difficult

' course or a coursewherein the

student’s area of expertise is not
based, leading to a i.on--
exemplary performance md
consequent student dissa: i: ‘ac-
tion.” Her assumptions are
exactly opposite to the research
findings. In each of the schools
with which the Office for the
Evaluation of Teaching has
worked to develop a student -
evaluation instrument, the rela-
tionship of how difficult a stu-
dent perceives a course to be to
that student's evaluation of the A
teacher has been studied. Never
have we found the negative rela-
tionship (i.e. more difficult, .
lower rating) Ms. Freggens
assumes. In some schools we
have found that there is a zero
relationship between these vari-
ables; teachers of courses per-

 

ceived as very difficult can be .
rated very high, very low or any-
where {in between. In a few
schools we have found a slight
positive relationship; A if the
course is judged difficult, there
is a higher probability the
teacher will be given a high rat-
ing. Our findings indicate that
students do not like faculty to
belabor easy material; they
would prefer to be challenged
‘by a more difficult course. The
findings here at Pitt are. in
agreement with those that other A
researchers have published in
the teaching evaluation
literature. —

The second assumption in
Ms. Freggens statement, that
students in courses outside their
“areas of expertise” give lower
rating to the teacher, is also
incorrect. Again, OET has
examined the ratings of stu-
dents in CAS whose major lies
in a different division (humani-
ties, social science, natural
science) than the course evalu-
ated. There is no significant dif-
ference between the ratings
given by majors and non-
majors. ‘

Ms. Freggens continues,
“Thus, these mandatory eval-
uationsare a most effective tool
for maliciousness and perhaps

   NM, elesga;ii;.....i;§:; .1983 I   is      e

unearned derision."

First, teaching evaluations
are not mandatory in CAS.
They are carried out only for
faculty who request them.

‘No student evaluation
questionnaire used by OET
asks students to judge the
‘extent of a teacher’s
knowledge.’ "

Second, the implication that
students who find a course diffi-
cult or the material outside '
their “expertise” .welcome
opportunities to be malicious is
totally unfounded. Inthe long
years I have worked with stu-
dents in evaluating teaching
both at Pitt and at another
. major university, I have found
that when the evaluation task is
presented to them seriously and
when they know their responses
will be given serious attention
by faculty, they are responsible,
careful, and constructively con-

i _ cerned about the teaching they .

are experiencing.

The leaders of student
government here at Pitt with
whom I have interacted on
issues of. publishing teaching
evaluations have been espe-

 

cially mature, in my judgment,
on this matter. Even a casual
examination of the booklet they
publish illustrates that they are
trying to present accurate infor-
mation in a format requiring
thought on the part .of the
reader; not just single numbers
for quick and easy comparison.
Ms. Freggens deplores OET
efforts to preserve rater anon-
ymity in the evaluations. “I
cannot understand the need for
secrecy. . ." There is abundant
research demonstrating that
ratings made without the pro-
tection of the rater’s anonymity
have neither the reliability nor
validity of those in which the
rater’s identity is protected.
This holds as well for faculty in
judging research manuscripts
submitted for publicationor for
grant applications. Even the
National Science Foundation,
after a careful examination of
its procedures for peer review of
requests for research grants,
conluded that the anonymity of
its reviewers must be preserved.
The statement that there is
little evidence that performance
evaluation is useful misrepre-
sents the published research in
the field of teaching evaluation
(as well as studies carried out
have been

 

 

published).
Finally . the answer to Ms.
Freggens question, “Are they
(student evaluations of teach-
ing) the only real critique of
teaching abilities?" is “of
course not." Clearly, students
do not have the background to
judge a faculty member's
knowledge of his orher disci-
pline. That can only be evalu-
ated by peers knowledgeable in
the same discipline. No student
evaluation questionnaire used
by OET asks students to judge
the extent of a teacher's knowl-
edge. These instruments may
ask whether the teacher shared
his/her knowledge with’ stu-
dents or inspired their confi-
dence in the teacher's
knowledge--very different
kinds of judgments. Other
aspects of teaching that cannot
be judged by students are dis-
cussed in the chapter I wrote for
the Handbook of Teacher Eva-
luation edited by J. Millman.
The literature on teaching
evaluation is extensive. Iwill be
glad to directanyone interested
in exploring it for the purpose
of developing an informed
opinion to pertinent references.

‘coupled with increased social and

economic instability, brinking on
total collapse.

Meanwhile. the Reagan admin-
is't,_ratiori has also continued its

. campaign to overthrow the govern-

. ‘port of oppressive regimes in '

\\

.ment of Nicaragua. In a Nov. 8,

1982 issue of Newsweek plans of a
CIA backed plan to overthrow the
Saridinist government were unco-
vered. Also, in the next few weeks
U.S. military personnel will con-
duct exercises with Honduran
troops on a sensitive part of the
Honduran-Nicaraguan border.
The potential for conflict is

 enhanced by the U.S. presence. The

scenario is reminiscent of the Bay
of Pigs and the Gulf of Tonkin.

This brings up the point of how
we here at Pitt are affected. On
Monday, jan. 25, 1983, President

eagan must onee again certify

at El Salvador is making pro-
gress on human rights, which is
undoubtedly a farce.

All indications are that he will. M
Encompassed in this package is an,

amount of aid totaling nearly $200
million, earmarked for military
and economic purposes. This is
quite a sum, considering El Salva-
dor’s size and population, which

will nontheless go to aid~the sup-.

pression and extermination of the
Salvadoran people.

This money, and the other mil-
lions proposed for the rest of this
region, could best be spent on
financial aid, extended unemploy-
ment benefits for parents of layed
off students and a vast array of
social services needed to ease the
plight of those suffering the most
from our current economic crisis.

If in fact the U.S. were to launch ,

an invasion of Central America
and engage in a Vietnam-type pro-
tracted guerilla war, the conse-
quences would be far reaching. A
draft would most likely follow, and
many college students and other
American youth. myself included,
might be inducted to fight. While a
draft may be temporarily unlikely,

_ it cannot be ruled out.

Recent reports by the Brookings

Instit_uti_on and the Atlantic Coun- -

cil assert that continued U.S. sup-

T _Africa _and Latin America could

result in serious military and social
crises. The reports call for the

» implementation of a draft to lower

minority percentages in the armed
forces.

The draft may‘be off down the
road, but we still must contend
with draft registration, which in
recent weeks has taken turn in rela-
tion to financial aid. Beginning
July 1, 1983, the Solomon Amend-
ment, which was passed by Con-
gress, will require all 18- to 24-year-
old male college students to
register for the draft in order to
receivejfinancial aid. This includes
Pell grants, work-study programs
and all state funds matched by fed-

_eral dollars. The Solomon Amend-_
be forced into registering in order ‘

to be eligible. The arnjendment has
no appeals process and does not
allow the student the "option for
religiousreasons, of conscientious
objector status.

All students should oppose a law
that requires individuals to register
for the draft in order to obtain
access to higher education. The

Solomon Amendment is another-

dangerous precedent in the contin-
ually coercive influence of the
government and the military on
the,institutions of higher educa-
tion in this country.

We also must oppose the use of
our taxes, to support policies of
mass murder in Central America
and speak out against Reagaii’s
recertification program. Such poli-
cies will only increase the suffering
of the people in this region and
increase the likelihood of U.S.
intervcntion—a step towards send-
ing many students to untimely
deaths on foreign soil.

Central Ameriyca’s Homeless

By MARTY wltus

To many Americans, the three-
year old civil war in El Salvador
represents all that is wrong in our
nation's foreign policies. Our
government is largely responsible
for the current atrocities in El
Salvador—the relentless killing of
civilians, the burning villages and
the displacement of many thou-
sands of peasants from their
homes. For those of us who wish to
avert a rerun of the Vietnam night-
mare, the situation in El Salvador
offers easy ammunition in the
domestic debate against all that
Reagan and his administration
stands for. A _

What is not so easy is to shift the
focus of our concerns away from

.the domestic problem of-defining

our national priorities and to reach
out directly to the Salvadoran peo-
ple in their time of suffering. One
local woman,’however, has done
exactly that.

Sister Rose Dalle Tezze put her
compassion into action the day she
set out for a refugee camp in Hon-
duras four months ago. She spent
the ‘next three months working
with Salvadoran refugees in a set of
camps near Colomoncagua, Hon-
duras, only one and a half miles
from their ravaged homeland.

Dalle Tezze described her expe-
riences Tuesday evening in an
informal speech ata meeting of the
Central ‘America Mobilization
Coalition, a local group that
opposes U.S. intervention in Cen-
tral America. She said that in the
20th century, we have witnessed
massive human carnage and that
the refugees of El Salvador and
Guatemala are saying, ‘We are
dying while you are sending arms
and bombs to our assassins.’ '

She returned to Pittsburgh on
Dec. 21, bringing with her docu-
ments of legal testimony from
some of the refugees as well as
dozens of photos and several draw-
ings by Salvadoran teenagers
depicting what life during wartime
is like. Some of the teens, she
pointed out, gave her letters writ-

ten to President Reagan pleading
with him to stop the flow of wea-
pons and money. john Beverley, a

Spanish professor at Pitt translated
one of the letters into English for
the publication in CentralAmerica
Focus.

Dalle Tezze, a Sister of Mercy,
had been ‘working under the auspi-

‘ ces of the United Nations High

Commission on Refugees. She des-

cribed the refugees as “living in

isolation and completely depend-
ent upon the services‘ rendered by
the international agencies such as
the United Nations, the Mennonite
Church, Doctors Without Fron-
tiers, and C.A.R.I.T.A.S., the
Catholic charity group which pro-
vides their food. Dalle Tezze was
joined in Honduras by relief

«workers from France, Germany,

Luxembourg, Canada, and Peru as
well as Americans. She said that the
Europeans referred to her president
as “Cowboy Reagan” and that “we
had no business in Central
America.”

While Honduras serves as ' a
haven for thousands of Nicaraguan
and Guatemalan refugees, it was
the Salvadorans with whom Dalle,
Tezze worked. Families forced to"
flee their homes in the province of
Morazan, where some of the most
intense military campaigns in the
warhave been waged, first arrived
in Honduras about two years ago.
New refugee families, many of
them splintered -by death and “dis-
appearances,” arrive every week.

“Some of them fled the war, but
many came because the-y were
being tortured by the government
soldiers. Their loved ones had died
at the hands of the military in El
Salvadr,” Dalle Tezze said.

There were seven camps in the
area near the pueblo of Colomon-
cagua, six of which Dalle Tezze
visited. The housing conditions
were extremely poor, according to
Dalle Tezze, with up to 24 to 30
persons crowded into each tent.

Their lives are hard. Herded
together in a foreign land, the Sal-
vadorans are living as prisoners,
forbidden to leave their tentsafter 6
p.m. each . night. The nearest

source of water is almost two miles

away from the camps.
'Of all the aspects of this sad
story, what came across most

clearly from hearilig _ Dalle Tezze
speak was the love and admiration
she holds for the people of El Salva-

dor. The source and inspiration of‘

this love is in the refugees them-

selves, in the beautiful way they._

care for each other.

' ‘V Dalle Tezze said she was in the

Honduras camps for two distinct
purposes. First, she was teaching
effective teaching methods to the
adults for use in their roles as edu-
cators of_ the young: Above and
beyond that, she said, “We were
there for security purposes. When a
foreigner was in the camps, the
refugees knew for certain that the
soldiers would not harass them."

The Central Arrieriain nations, '

except Nicaragua, are currently

. undergoing zrprolonged version of

the McCarthy era, in whiclpall

types of political -opposition -

groups are commonly accused‘ of
being communist or_ subversive.
Unfortunately, these governments
have learned from theirﬂncle Sam
that the easiest way to get banels of
North American money‘ is to
deliver a__stream of anti-communist

‘rhetoric as often as possible.

Within the last 20 years, even the
Catholic Church has come under

the distrustful scrutiny of Right-_

wing Central American regimesfor.
its teaching the poor and hungry

masses of a new “liberation tlieol- 

ogy.” For this reason, Dalle Tezze
said, she was warned about the

dangers of being a nun who works i

with the poor.

. -“We were even afraid to talk
about our own government. ‘We
were warned about that because if
you do that, you're called a com-
munist. My thing is“Ojala!’ ‘(I
hope sol), I wish I were a true

Christian Communist-then I’dbe ’

a true Christianas exemplified by
Christ,” she said. . .

The Salvadoran. people are
representative of an age-old
paradox, according to Dalle Tezze.
“They havea fear of death, yet they
are willing to die for their cause,

, which is justiceand the restoration

of human rights. They refuse to go
into oblivion. They are very
emphatic that'if they should die,
their deaths will not be in vain.'_,"_

BOW WOW WOW
Stanley Showcase
Ian. 16, 1983

By TODD ERKEL

BOW WOW WOW: First reactions
vary "from ”ooh', neat” curiosity to
"omigod" repulsion. In between,
most who looked listened and
resigned themselves to another
danceable trend. ,

This, more than any other, was a
band created, marketed, hyped ‘and
ripened for the '80s, but somehow,
remarkably, they've remained
vibrant. Judging by the performance
here at the Stanley, the future holds
only more of a good thing getting
better.

The band has broken ties with men-
tor Malcolm McLaren; a giant step

toward achieving any genuine and --

lasting vitality. Maybe now the

group's energies can be devoted to"

musical evolution and ‘Annabella
Lwin’s natural gifts-—her voice and
effervescence—can be bared without

' traipsing her other endowments all

over the newstands.'A great picture

’ may draw a thousand glares, but

good music is what sells vinyl.
Annabella made her entrance into
the Stanley fully clad in a green dress
and Sunday school cardigan, and yet
she was no less dynamic. Sexuality
and charisma such as hers needn't
and shouldn't be exploited for atten-

 tion’s sake.
‘ The set, which lasted little more '
than an hour, touched on both old

and new material. Songs off the new
_, album, entitled When The Going Gets
., Tough, The Tough Get Going, relied more

Wow :

the . polyrhythmic beat to a small
thunder.

The, obvious problem with the Bow
Wow Wow ”sound" is its sameness,
especially in the rhythm section.
Drummer Dave Barbarossa could
just as easilyprogram his parts before
hand then retreat to the bar.

Cover tunes like "I Want Candy”
and their own ”Baby, Oh No,” (which
they didn't perform) may signal a
shift toward more accessible pop—like
melodies driven by Matt Ashman’s
guitar and less top heavy with tribal

war drums. Ashman’s hollow-bodied
Gretsch, made infamous by Chet
Atkins, embodies many of the wond-
erfully eerie sounds of that legend's
country and western roots.

”Maff’s" mowhawked stare 2 rend-
ers him the archetypical British pimka;
the malcontented stockboy lashing

working class.

BILLY SQUIERISAGA
Civic Arena
Ianuary 18. 1983

By GEORGE HOLZER

First nights of a tour are usually ‘

difficult. Setting up r'uns overtime,
soundchecks slowly and performan-
ces start late and end late. Saga and
Billy Squier ran into these difficul-
ties, but gave a great show despite the
problems. ‘ A
Saga ‘hit the stage 15 minutes late
without a sound check and still gave
their best Pittsburgh show ever. The
crowd was nearly unanimous in back-

‘ ing these Canadian rockers. Lead

vocalist Michael Sadler exhibited
many talents besides singing while
playing keyboards, bass and briefcase
(a Simmon’s electric drum kit
enclosed in a small briefcase). Best of
their tunes were ”Wind Him Up" and
”On The Loose." Saga will “soon be
experiencing the popularity they
know in Canada and Europe here in
the States.

Billy Squier then assaulted the ears
of Pittsburgh's-youth; he opened

with ”Everybody ‘Wants You" and 4,

kept going nonstop -for 90 minutes.
Best of Squier's songs were ”My‘

’ Kinda Lover,” ”Lonely Is The Night"

and ”Emotions In Motion." Billy and
band were recalled’ twice for encores;
the first was‘ "The Stroke,” by far‘ his
best known tune. The second, ”Keep
Me Satisfied," came short of satisfy-
ing the audience, but clapping,
stomping and shouting failed to get
another encore. When the house

_ lights came upgthe. people let -_out"a -

The ]\/Ian  Who
Wouldn't Be Trendy

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

One of the hardest things
about life is learning to adjust to
all the new changes that are

’ thrown at us from every direc-

tion every minute of the day-
new fashions, new hairdos, new
technology (even the office of
this humble magazine recently
acquired computer terminals,

_ which will make typewriters all

but obsolete—what's this world
coming to.7.7!) and new music.
The music world is especially
bent on creating trends; every-
body fromrich record company
execs to unemployed teenagers
living in the east end of London
get in on the act, dictating
what's going to be "in" for that
year, or in some ‘cases, that
month. After living through the“
Woodstock era, ar‘en-rock,
heavy-heavy metal, acid rock,
punk, ska, reggae, new wave,
new romantic and synthopop,
it's nice to know that some

things never change—that

there are a few people out there
who don't just jump on the
latest bandwagon hoping for
their 15 minutes of fame. Billy
Price is one such rarity.

4.

Billy Price and the Keystone
Rhythm Band have just released
their «second album, They Found
Me Guilty, on the very independ-
ent and very regional-based

 label of Green Dolphin. To be
perfectly blunt, while the album ‘S
" is selling well in the Pittsburgh

area, it's not going to be a mon-
ster, nation-wide smash—and
not because it isn't a good pro-
duct, but simply because of

logistics: an artist who's not on a V

major label has no money to
allow him to take huge ads out
in the music rags like Rolling
Stone and Creem and no money to
help pay for an extensive tour or
an opening slot on someone
else’s tour, much less make
videos to send to MTV. But,
unlike a lot of the trendies, Price
isn't about to hang up his music
just because he isn't selling gold
albums.

"I don't have unrealistic
dreams ab‘out superstardom

anymore," he explains. "I'm'

doing it because 1 like the
music—it’s real important to
me. I'm more satisfied now than
I've ever been. Maybe that's
because my expectations have
changed. We have a great band,

and it sounds better than it ever
has and I'm real happy about
that." '

. Not that he'd turn down an

offer from a big record label.
"No, I certainly wouldn't turn it

down if it was a decent of-

fer...I've been close a lot of
times, but right now, the situa-
tion in the record business is
just ridiculous. The number of
bands that get signed compared

to the number that break‘

through is enormous and that's
because of the way radio is
today—they play one sort of
sound; it's not like the '60s
where a lot of different styles

were played. And they're so
limited by those survey things
(the Arbitron and Birch ratings). But
you just have stick with what
you do best and fight it out in
the storm.

"We don't think to ourselves,
'Okay, we're gonna try to sound
like such and such that's being
played on the radio,’ we simply
do what we do. But I think that

, what we do is commercial in the

sense that it's easier to get off
on; it's not esoteric, it's not that

. unusual, it's not avant—garde or

anything...it's rock and blues,
but really just classic rock and
roll to me," he says:

 ‘Showcase, Friday January 21, 1983.‘

 '

 

When Ben Kingsley walked into
the Western Room of the Century
Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, there
were few people present who would
have thought that this man was a
critically acclaimed actor, let alone
the one who had filled the sandals of

‘the _role of Mahatma Gandhi in
. Richard Attenborough’s epic film,

Gandhi. If Kingsley could have sensed
this as he crossed the threshold of the
banquet room, it would have made
him happy.

Sitting down at the small round
table of reporters, Kingsley, dressed
in a light blue dress shirt and baggy
cheenos, is approached by one of the
waiters and asked if he wants some—
thing to drink. He orders Perrier but
quickly changes his mind to a club
soda. ”I’ve been drinking so much

V Perrier here that I understandl might

be suffering from sodium poisoning,"
he says laughing, "Something I find a
bit scary.” Kingsley’s humorous
interpretation of such an incredulous
and distinctly Californian possibility
gets a big laugh and immediately puts
everyone at eas_e.

It is this mixture of good nature
and poise that equips Ben Kingsley
with ‘such a fascinating and even
endearing presence. He commands
attention with a soft-spoken sense of
control~—not unlike the man he por-
trays in Gandhi. It makes one wonder
whether he brought these qualities to
the role or ‘vice versa.

Without a doubt, one ofthe charac-
teristics that he brings to the screen is
a striking physical resemblance to
Gandhi,~and even here, without the
magic of movie screen makeup, his
facial features strike an almost

lg uncanny likeness to the Indian lead-

er's. The permanently bronzed skin
(though somewhat faded from the
BritishlAmerican climates no doubt),
the curved nose and the distinct,chi-
selled jaw and chin lend themselves
remarkably to his role. Yet, when all
is said and done, Ben Kingsley will
not just be remembered for his physi-
calresemblance to Gandhi, but more
so for his stirring recreation and
interpretation of a man whose life
showed the way to peace through
nonviolence—he achieves a true one-
ness with the role. ”

He does not see his unification with
the character as-acting, but instead as
"being." He feels that acting is done
during rehearsal and is, in ajsense, the
preparation of a mold for the final
product. "Being," then, is the molten

metal that is poured, during filming, ,

into this hypothetical mold. "SoI sup-
pose my preparation is chipping away
at the mold and hoping that the
metal, when I pour it out, isn't going
to go 'clunk' because ‘it's not hot
enough,” he says with a smile. "But
that I make it hot enough in the fur-

nace of my imagination to pour it into ’

Ben Kingsley forges the role

the mold so that it will flow spontane-
ously but still set in the shape that I
want it to. That is the difference
between acting and being."

Judging from his well-acclaimed
career, almostexclusively as a theat-
rical actor, Kingsley has had plenty of
the experience necessary to stoke the
coals of his- creativity. A native of
Yorkshire, England, he has been in
love with the theater since the age of
19. Since 1967, he has been a member
of the Royal Shakespeare Company
playing such roles as Conrade in Much
Ado About Nothing and Demetrius in A
Midsummer Night's Dream. He has also
appeared independently in several of
Athol Fugard's plays (ironically,
Fugard plays General Smuts in
Gandhi) and most recently starred in
Bertold Brecht’s Baal, for which he
also wrote the music. '

Nevertheless, Kingsley’s most
demanding theatrical performance
came in 1975 when he tackled Hamlet

at London's Roundhouse Theatre. »

His presentation was widely cele-
brated and one critic described him as

a "dedicated mental explorer and"

spiritual discover." To this day, he
has an open invitation from the
'R.S.C. to return and perform with
them.

As would seem the case, Kingsley
sees his previous roles as excellent
preparations for his role as Mahatma
Gandhi. Ultimately, for him, the role

of Gandhi was a tragic one that was _
brought to the theatre of true life. "I S
.haven't played King Lear—I would

like to one day—but I suppose Gandhi
is the closest I'll get to playing a com-
bination of Hamlet and King Lear.
Gandhi's end is utterly tragic; his life
is a quest for truth involving his wit,
his intelligence andhis pragmatism,"
he says, ”so all of that stage~expe—
rience centering around Hamlet,.but
also_with I-‘ugard...all ofthose lessons
finally crystallized and paid off when
I embarked upon the. heroic sil-
houette of Gandhi because Shakes-
peare and «Fugard present the
audience with people of heroic pro-
portions, but they have to be fleshed

out with the light of common
I experience."
Armed with this philosophy,

Kingsleyembarked upon the role of
the great Indian politician. To pre-
pare for his character, he began to
study old newsreels of the Mahatma
and approximately 200 stills of the

guru, which he pasted on the-walls of .

. hishotel room. Fror'n,th_ese celluloids

he began to mold himself into the.
cinematic Gandhi. "I used to study his
face and how he stood and how he
might take the next step after the one
in the photograph," he says, his eyes
seeming to flash back to his room full
of photos. "I also used to look at the
faces around him and study the level
of their attention on him; study how
they are listening to him. Some are
listening with a sort of latent grin on
their faces—either recovering from
the laugh they've just had or waiting
in enormous expectation for the
laugh they're about to have—while
some are sitting with a look in their
eyes and their ears almost visibly
pricked as if they did not want to miss
a word that might come out of his
mouth. It was studying the level of
attention around him that gave me a
very important clue as to the kind of
personality he had."
In addition to his preparation of
Gandhi's persona, Kingsley prepared
for the physical aspects of the role.
For this, he adopted a strict vegetar-
ian dietand began to practice the art
of yoga. Originally, the yoga was
intended to give Kingsley more of the
incredible litheness that Gandhi pos-
sessed (because of his own yoga prac-
tice) up until his death, but ‘as he
readily admits, it helped him deal
with the often intense fear that
accompanied the role of a man of such
deified proportions. "There were

.times when I walked onto location

and there were thirty or forty thou-
sand Indians waiting to see what I
would look like, and there was the
possibility of the breathing getting a
little bit shallow, so that by the time

you got to filming the famous musi-

cal, sonorous, warm voice of his (looks

A petrified), something very scary was

going to come out,” he feigns stam-
mering as he breaks into a huge smile.
"But it was‘ the yoga that centered me
on the ‘work and kept me from being

. frightened of the awesome responsi-

bility of playing a man ofhis integrity
and impeccable character."

Without a doubt,. there are still
countless numbers of people, both
Indian and non—Indian, who see
Gandhi as a saint or a god. Naturally,
this posed quite an issue of controv-
ersy when it came time to film—an
issue that was quietly settled by Pan-
dit Nehru, the first prime minister of
India and a close friend of the Mahat-
ma’s. It was he who told Sir Richard
not to deify Gandhi, but to portray

-him as the man» he truly was.*In

- the ideal acting exercise."

Kingsley’s eyes, Nehru's mandate
was the most responsible avenue to

 

take. "If you portray'_the man as K

something superhuman, as someone
that-goe,s beyond our mortal limits,

then, in a sense, you're making it easyg, ., 

/ ’

because you're saying, 'Oh well,   i

wasn't like us; he was almost extra-
terrestrial, and it is no good even try-
ing to follow his examples,’ " he says,
then offers an example, "...I’m. sure
that Christ was a brilliant political
pragmatist, but now it's so hard to
scrape away the rituals around him to
get to the truth—it's very difficult to
know what is the myth and what is
the man. So what we had to do was
make a film that remembered Gandhi
as a man who mobilized the politics of
_his country and put politics back in

the hands of the people rather than a 5-\ y
a deity." He continues by saying tha "*"' 

a lot of this responsibility fell into his
hands, but that, in a way, it made his
task easier because it was more in his
realm of acting to play ahuman being
than a saint or god. "Of course, one
does have the level of expectation of

the man that is in the hearts and-

‘ minds of the Indian audiences and

also many of the audiences outside of
India," he says. ”So one had to pro-
tray a totally remarkable and unique
man and keep that constant balance
and -never go outside ..the limits of
being a human being. I suppose it's_

However, there were many by-
standers on location who saw Kings-
ley a-s more than just an actor
portraying Gandhi. Several times he
was approached by Indian villagers
who knelt and kissed his sandals or
touched his shawl. While this
unnerved him, he realized that it was
inevitable and learned to incorporate I
it into his acting experience. "I/Vhile I
had to take their gestures as sensi-
tively as I could, Gandhi used to be
quite abrupt and say, 'No, no, you

_mustn't do that. I'm a man, not a

saint,’ " he explains‘. "So I suppose my
response to them was a microcosm of
his, and it ended up being an acciden; ;

tal acting lesson that I had to adop 

the same kind of conduct in front of.
that kind of greeting...I sense that it
might have been a secret message-
an aid that was given naturally to me
to help the acting."

Now that Kingsley has had some
time to reflect on his portrayal of the
Indian Bapu, Kingsley feels that the
hardest part of his role was "finding
the thread that links all of the scenes
together." He was determined to
glean what it was that remained'sta-

ble while Gandhi grew and changeQ.f~_‘\

from a young, naive lawyer of 26 to a
wise prophet for peace at age 79. He

" finally found an answer. "I had come

to the conclusion that it was the -

nary.intelligence—and he had a gen-
erosity of intelligence, more
importantly, not the sort of vain
intelligence that patronizes people-
that's deadly," he stresses. "I mean he
had a generosity of intelligence that
enabled him to have tea with King
George V,‘ talk with great French phi-
losophers and Indian leaders, while at
the same time, being able to com-
municate with the inarticulate and
the poorest of the poor. It was that
range of intelligence that I found

" most endearing and the central target

of his character." A

* While Kingsley has, no doubt, had
an effect on the Indian people with
his recreation of the Indian leader, his
portrayal of Gandhihas also had its-

effects on him. For one, the actor's_

perceptions of the Mahatma have
greatly changed. ”I-had thought of
him as a rather benign peasant. A nice
old chap who used to walk through
villages and everyone would stop
fighting," he says. "What I didn't
focus on was his extraordinary intel-
ligence, and that he was a true genius

of the twentieth century who had his

hand gently on the pulse of the
world's politics.'That I really had no/_

conception of."

In addition, Kingsley's discovery of
the true Gandhi and his philosophies
has altered his view of_ his own per-
sonal life. "It's given me a better pers-
pective...I think it's ‘got rid of a lot of
sentimental areas of my thinking and
made «my everyday life my politics,
rather than trying to ‘subscribe to an
abstraction—which is much more
exciting for me," he says with a grin.
"It's more important to be what I am
than to go and vote for the party. I've
found that it's really up tome in my
everyday life with who I meet and
who I'm with."

Now, with Gandhi under his belt
and serious talk of an Oscar for his
role in the air, the only obvious ques-
tion that seems to be left for Kingsley
is: what next? However, there is
already an answer to. that question.
His next performance will be as the

husband in the screen adaptation of ‘

Harold Pinter's Betrayal with Patricia
Hodge and Jeremy Irons. He calls this
role a total contrast from Gandhi and
describes himself as wearing a pin
stripe suit, driving a BMW and hav-
ing terrible troubles with his mar-
riage. Betrayal, ironically, will be
released approximately two weeks
after the nationwide opening of

‘Gandhi. After that, Kingsley intends

to go back to the stage but insists that
he will continue to divide his time
between both theater and cinema.

The generic surroundings of the
Western Room come back into focus
as a man approaches and informs us
that there is time for one more ques-
tion, which happens to center on
Kingsley's approach to versa.tility.
His answer is quick in coming. "As
versatility is concerned, the actor is
stuck with his own body, his own sil-
houette, and there's not much he can
do.-But given that, I would like to be
as versatile as I possibly can, and in
the past, I feel I have been very versa-
tile," he says. "To have Hamlet and
Gandhi in my repertoire is already
something I'm immensely proud of
and a little surprised and puzzled by
because it's a series of coincidences
that linked them. I hope it continues
really—not let's go and see Ben
Kingsley, but let's go and see Gandhi
or Betrayal. I think that that way it's
safer and has more to do with craft
and work than the other way of look-
ing at it." ’ .

. With that, Ben Kingsley smiles and
politely excuses himself from the
table to go off and conquer, in ano-
nymity, the new Everests that await

_ in _th_e world of stageand screen.

Here's To The Movies

THE BEST MOVIE TRIVIA AND
QUIZ BOOK EVER "
By Malcolm Vance
Bonanza Books .

The quizzes overshadow the tri-

MATINEE IDOLS: PORTRAITS OF
THE STARS

Ed. by Michael lay a
Galahad Books . -

”The best of all the studio pin-ups

of the Matinee Idols, the men and-..\

women who have been making
hearts throb from the 19305 until
today” have been collected in Matinee "
Idols: Portraits of the Stars, 48 photo-
graphs in black-and-white and in
color. MGM, Columbia, Warners,
Paramount and the rest of the stu-
dios maintained fatherly interest in
generating their stars’ publicity;
some well-known Hollywood
photographers—Scotty Welbourne,
Whitey‘Schafer, Bert Six, Bud Fraker
and others—exhibit their incredible
skill and dedication to perpetrating
the myth. A

The perfectly structured composi-
tions from Hollywood's Golden
Age—the "30s and ’40s—contrast
with the natural photos of Candice
Bergen, Katharine Ross and the
other newer faces. But the old‘ pic-
tures are better, saturated with
other-worldly Dream Factory glam-
our: Veronica Lake with peek-a-boo
hair and a polar bear; Jane Russell in
the hay and very little else for The
Outlaw;.a _stunning Ava Gardner in
black silk and long gloves. And
there's Doris Day, Robert Taylor,
Norma Shearer and Cary Grant, all
looking unapproachable, unper-
turbed and beautiful.

There are some odd choices
included, but Matinee Idols is a marve-

lous collection——a great coffee table
book.

HEROES OF THE SILVER SCREEN
Ed. by Michael Iay
Galahad Books

Hollywood Goddesses, part of Gala-
had’s ”The World of Movies” series,
offers separate profiles of 18 well-
known and worshipped actresses,
mostly the last-name crowd—Garbo,
Dietrich, Harlow, Hayworth, Craw-'
ford and others. The book's _male
counterpart is Heroes of the Silver Screen,
featuring 16 of the finest—Cooper,
Gable, Peck, Wayne and Tracy
among them‘-—again, stars who are

immediately recognizable from “the '

surnames.

A number of authors contributed
articles to the text, which is under-
standably varied in emphasis and

 
     
    
    
 
   

rial, even for/non-fans.

  
 
    

style. In general, the articles are con-
cisely written, skimming private
lives, career highlights, major films
and ‘roles of each performer and
offering rather -superficial analyses
of their star quality. There are occa-
sional slight inaccuracies that may
annoy the purist (Lana Turner was
not discovered at a Hollywood
drugstore).

The best parts of both books are
the detailed and complete filmogra-
phies and the illustrations—
numerous movie posters, stills and
publicity shots, including some in
beautifully vivid technicolor: Gary
Cooper onvhorseback and Rita Hay-
worth as Terpsichore, goddess of the
dance. _

phical dictionaries, but Hollywood God-_ ‘-

A lot of other people would
term Pfice and his band as a clas-
sic rhythm and blues group, and
there is often the mistaken con-
n_otation of their being a revival-
ist act. But Price disagrees
strongly: "N o, I consider Sha'Na
Na a revivalist band, in the
sense that they try ‘to bring

‘everything back, including the
costumes and the language. I'm
not trying to bring back any era;
I mean, this stuff is contempor-
ary to me. I live in 1982!"

"I didn't consciouslyiset out to
do just rhythm and blues; I just
made the choice of doing what I
do best. And there's really not a
whole lot of rock and roll I like,"
he says surprisingly. "I listen to
maybe five or six bands regu-
larly, including black contem-
porary music...Elvis Costello,
but not really too much."

While admitting that he prob-
ably won’t ever become a major V
concert draw outside of the
Pittsburgh area, Price, never-
theless, has a few not-so—lofty
ambitions. "I'd like to get out
more; we travel as much as we
can. A seven piece band with
three roadies is kind of expen-
sive, you need a lot of money to
travel. But, we do get to go to a
few places; we're popular down
in Washington, D.C., Virginia,
North 'Carolina, Philadelphia
and Boston.

"I'd also like to be a national
act instead of a regional act. I'd
like for people who like the kind
of music we play to be able to
walk into any record store and
buy one of our records," he says
hesitantly before conceding
that if none of that works out,
which, it might not, he won't

"Take Me, I'm Yours" gets the

THE BITTEREST PILL
DIG THE NEW BREED
The Jam

Polygram

New albums are often signs:
of growth for a band. For sev--
eral reasons that is not the case
with The Jam. After over five
years of musicianship, the band
has decided to call it quits. The
group's dissolution has moti--
vated Polygam and/or The Jam
to prepare two record packages,
The Bitterest Pill and Dig The New
Breed. With the release of this EP
and live album respectively, the
talented‘\trio seems to be trying;

I to hand their.fans something

memorable—onIy these are not

‘albums The Jam should be

remembered by. ' .
The Bitterest Pill is simply an EP

that begins where The Gift
ended. In fact, it's close enough
to be the outtakes from The Gift
sessions. Each of the five songs
is a throwaway" that pays hom-
age to Motown and not enough
attention to the usually innova-
tive stylings of Paul Weller. 7

I On the other hand, Dig The-

New Breed is a compromise. It is a

live album that's a fairly decent
chronicle of the .band's past five
years. The album includes ver-
sions of ”In The City," "All Mod
Cons," ”Going Underground”
and "That's Entertainment"
among others. For those who

have waited for a live Jam

THEYFOUND ME GUILTY
Billy Price &‘ The KRB
Green Dolphin

Do all white blues enthusiasts
feel guilty about crossing the
tracks to entertain their love of
the form? . V

Billy Price pleads guilty, not
only to being a blues enthusiast,
but also to being a purist. His
approach to record making has

to be applauded, not for being,
particularly ambitious, but for ‘L

ignoring the compromising
school of thought the brings,
commercial success these days.

More accessible artists like
Southside Johnny and George
Thorogood incorporate blues
elements into their sound, but

Price chooses to immerse him- ‘

self completely; a purist with a
clean heart may be as close as a
white man gets to soul.

Price's music isn't, at least it

~ shouldn't be, that distant from

the mainstream. In fact, in less
rigid days, it was songs such as
these that dominated the air-

waves. "Hold Back The Night,” I

with its lively R&B bounce and
shifting tempo has all the vital-
ity of the great party tunes of
the late '50s and early/60s. ’
Side 1's ”Tell Me” and
"Nothing Could Change My
Mind" could be the album's best
tracks. Both were written by
KRB guitarist Keith Grimes,
and both showcase P-rice’s
"greatest vocal quality: his ability
to interpret, whether it be a

more traditional R&B ballad .

such as "Tell Me” or Green's

gospel-like rocker, ”I Feel’
-Good." " ’

Power and range have
become dispensable in this age

of studio technology, although .

Price needn't rely on that. It's
that ability to interpret, to
stamp a song as your own, that
makes him such a rarity.
Music such as Price's recalls a
simpler era of American life
when it was love—lost, sought
and gained—that "filled our
thoughts. Anarchist and head-
bangers of today may eat to a
different beat, but give me a
shot of Price's rhythm and blues

to cure my indigestion. /

latest effort, A Broken Frame

‘inside; last year's debut, Speak

and Spell was, afterall, a boring
trip through the worst of syn- .
tho's minimalism—two.sides of
sheer torture. But then. I hear
”See You," from t_he new album I
on Y104 and it gets caught in my
brain, so I give the album a
listen. And, will wonders never
cease, it's good stuff! '

Instead of that hollow repeti-
tiveness that colored Speak and

Spell, A Broken Frame relies more
on soft, lulling rhythms to draw
the listener in. Their style is
understated and popsy (indeed,
some of the cuts sound like
Beatle-ish or Beach Boy-ish in
structure—the harmonies are
that tight) and danceable all at
once. "See You" is still the disc's
highest point, it's simply simple,
and ‘the dashing lyrics are more
than effective in getting the

point across:.”...l'll tr; not to hold

you/And I'll try not to kiss you/But
you knowl still love you/All I want to
do is see you/Don't you know that it's
true?" But there are several good
tunes ‘here, including ”My
Secret Garden” and ”Leave In

Silence," which could be the
second and third singles off the
album, respectively.

Depeche Mode is a very
young band—they're all under
21—and if experience comes’
with age, I can't wait to see what,
the future holds for them and
for us.

SHOWTIMTE

The I. Geils Band

EMI America ’
With the release of Showtime,

the J. Geils Band has completed

' its coup de grace of success as it is

measured in contemporary
rock—n-roll. Freeze Frame went
platinum, its two Top 20 singles
camped out on the charts and
the group toured hockey arenas
everywhere. Showtime is only
here in the event any fan's dol-
lars have gone unspent. Why,
then only a single album? Could:

it be that record buyers don't ’

bleed as green as they once did?‘

Despite all of that, the record
is lots of fun. Peter W_olf
radiates an ”ah, to hell with you’
all, I'm having a good time" cha-
risma, and the simmering local
bar atmosphere generated by
the music will have you looking
for sloshed beer. It's not..the’
most intimate record, but:-t-hen‘
again, if you found yourself in;
section "I can't C-13," this could’
be an improvement.

I. Geils has never been known
for sit—down music, and that's
especially true here. Side 1's
shuffling "Walls Come Tumb-
lin' Down" and rowdy "Sanctu-
ary" are really only warm-ups

for the flip side's "I Do" and the —

cover of "Land of a Thousand
Dances." If friends remain
seated during the latter two, it's
time to meet new people.

I We could do without Wolf's-l

introductions, though. His
"Love Rap" prelude to "Love

Stinks" is dry as dust, and the.

fact that you have to flip the
disk to get to the song only
makes it more expendable.

Not many people gave the

Panther basketball team a chance
when it faced Georgetown Wednes-
day night. ‘
‘ Even though Pitt was coming off
a 14 point win over »rival‘West Vir-
ginia, critics were still doubting
the Panthers. After all, a week ear-
lier, Villanova chased Pitt out’of
the Fitzgerald Field House. '

The Hoyas had the best antago-
nist in college basketball in 7-0 cen-
ter Patrick Ewing. Surely, the
Panthers would yield the middle‘ to
him. .

However, they didn’t let Ewing
roam free, even though he had 22
points. ,

They ‘also didn't lose by 16
points as the bookmakers had pre-
dicted. Instead, the 62-54 loss to
Georgetown gave Pitt confidence
going into the rest of the season
and the Big East rivals“ respect for
the often-beleagured Panthers.

, There were 9,955 pairs of raised
eyebrows in the_ Capital Center
when Pitt took a 26-21 lead with
two minutes in the first half, espe-
cially since Georgetown had a six
point lead earlier in the half and
was preparing to take total control
of the game.

The Panthers had help when
Ewing picked up his third foul
with 5:25 in the first half. But Pitt

Spikers

. Ray Reilly, coach of the Panther
volleyball team, is starting his
fourth and final season at Pitt.
There's no. looking .back at the
rather successful years that the vol-
leyball program hasenjoyed. And
there isn’t even any looking ahead.
This, the 1983 season, is the volley-
ball team's last.

No matter how somber this may
sound, Reilly and his players are
looking to release a smash hit,
looking to climb to the top of the
Eastern Conference Volleyball
League standings.

“When I heard we were can-
celled,” Reilly said, .“we held a
team meeting in one of the player’s
apartments after» that and a lot of

the guys let out their bitterness. We ~

sat down and talked about the
upcoming season and settled on
the fact that we're going to try and
win the East title.

“These players want to show the
athletic department that they made
a mistake... As long as we’re play-
ing, we still have a breath of a
chance to save the program. I hope
they would reconsider if we end up
No. l or 2 in the East.”

If only for the sake of the pro-
gram itself, Reilly said that this
region of the country is a volleyball
hotbed brimming with talent. The
Western Pennsylvania area alone is
the second largest volleyball sector
in the country, boasting about 80
high school teams.

Of the six freshmen on Reilly's
squad, only one is from outside of
Western Pennsylvania. Pitt is so
young that two sophomores, one
junior and one senior compose the
remainder of the team. ‘

Already, the Panthers have ven-
tured on the road, when they were
invited to Canada's annual pow-
wow——the Excalibur Classic. Pitt
came home with a 3-2 record and
placed fifth out of theeight teams.
The two defeats ‘came to top-
ranked Manitoba and tenth-ranked
Waterloo.

"It was an exceptionally good

"weekend," Reilly said. “Consider- _

ing the team makeup, our finish-

_ ing fifth out of eight is good for an _

lost its poise, turning the ball over
three times in the final minutes of
the first half as the Hoyas regained
a 27-26 lead at halftime.

The game was tied during the
early stages of the second half, but
the constant pressure by George-
town gave the Hoyas a 42-32 lead
with freshman Michael Jackson
supplying the offense. Jackson,
who for two weeks in a row was

named Big East Rookie of the i 
a. Week, scored eight of the 12 points

Georgetown had at that stretch.
Meanwhile, Pitt could only man-
age a Clyde Vaughan jumper dur-
ing- this period—two of his 21
points. , — _ ’ '

Maybe this was the timewhen
the Panthers would fold, but they
refused to. Pitt had the lead down
to four, 42-38, but Ewing showed
his presence with two’ arena-
vibrating jams. . H _

With a basket and two free
throws by David Wingate, the
Hoya lead was back to 12.

The Panthers refused to" give in.

“Of the eight teams, five were in

Pitt also had to deal with the fact
that all Canadian teams are in the
middle of their season. The Pan-
thers are just starting theirs, one
that is very rough-edged due to new
blood. Accordingly, Reilly put his
players—the freshmen more than
the upperclassmen—-through a lot
of shuffling and experimentation.

“It was good for the freshmen to
get their feet wet,” he added.

productive three weeks for Pitt; the
squad hasimany parts of its game to

One facet they will work on
closely is blocking; an area, Reilly
says, that is “not where it should
be.” The team operates a 5-1
offense, one that is diverse yet fairly
basic in nature. Reilly can run

Nevertheless, Pitt proved it

Also, Reilly has recently noticed
poor conditioning behavior. He is,
therefore, putting the players

through a lot of sprinting tests and ‘
endurance drills.

“Right now, we’re pretty green,”
Reilly said. “And it's because of the

Win  

Now, the Panthers will have an H

_opportunity to gain their first win
in the Big East as Pitt hosts Seton
Hall at the field house tomorrow
night at 8 p.m. Some may consider
the Pirates the “weak sister” of the
conference, but Chipman refuses

— this theory.

“No, we are not taking them
lightly at all," Chipman said.
“They may come in here thinking
we’re the “weak sister” of the Big
East. This is our biggest game of
the year. We need a win in the
conference.” .

First year Seton Hall coach P._].
Carlesimo said the 3-10 Pirates are
having problems similar to Pitt’s.

“I see Pitt as a team like us-
struggling,” he said of the Pirates,
who are also winless in five Big
East contests.

_ “We haven't been able to put
together a 60 minute game.”

Two players the Panthers have
to be\concerned with are freshman
forward Andre McCloud and guard
Kenny Powell.

“Andre has struggled a little bit
in the early season,” Carlesimo
said. “His points are coming a lit-
tle harder in the Big East. Kenny is

really a two (off) guard,_ but because -

of our needs, we’re playing him at
_the point.”

The Panthers have shown they
can win some battles in the Big

games in the conference.

Reilly likes the position he's in.

that his program is on its last leg.

Volleyball Team Alive
Despite Nearing Death

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The doctor gave the kids a year to live and said, “Go out and make
the most of time. Learn everything there is to learn in a year." So
Pitt’s volleyball team, whose six starters total nine years of colle-
giate playing experience, is doing just that.

They are young, talented and distraught that the plug will soon
be pulled—Dr. Edward Bozik having recently announced that
men's volleyball and women's field hockey programs will be can- ,
celled after this year. Field hockey has passed away. Volleyball is

still kicking, or is it spiking?

“Last year we had twice the talent. . .this year we have twice as

difficult a schedule," said spiker Barry Goldberg, “but we're going

i for it like crazy. Attitude-wise, this year's team is probably one of the

best we've had here in quite a while. In previous years we've had
some controversies. . .players didn’t come to practice—Coach Reilly ‘

asks his players to put a lot out. Some don't like to put out. It has

been that way for years."

This year, the house was cleaned. No fewer than four starters left
the team: Gene Larson dropped out of Pitt because he had no
money, Jim Grant and Gary Groshner quit the team to spend more.
time on school work, and Bill Knuth decided that sunny California

was his true place in life.

“When they left,” Goldberg explained, “they had no idea that the
program would be cancelled. When they found out, they said,

‘That's terrible.’

“Last season dragged,”_Goldberg added. “Some people didn’t get
along real well with the coach. The problem solved itself—the
people that didn’t want to be here left.’' , ‘

Soon, the volleyball team will leave too, leaving behind only a
peculiar history. In recent years, Pitt, whichoffers no volleyball _'
scholarships, has played competitively against schools that do offer ,

Even though its record, is 0-4, the
Lady Panther swim team has not
suffered through a lack of talent. In
fact‘, the team's individual times
have improved since the beginning
of the season. But the winless
record still stands out, and Pitt
would like to remedy that against
Clarion State tomorrow afternoon.

However, coach Dave Belowich
doesn't expect an easy time with
the Lady Eagles-—a team the Lady

’ Panthers easily handled last year.

“They are the defending
national champions in Division
II," he said. “They present a
challenge—they have no
weakness.”

’ Another advantage Clarion has
over last year is that the meet is held
at their pool.

“They have home pool advan-
tage," Belowich said. “We have to
adjust to the walls and the diving
_boards while they have
knowledge."

The Penn State meet last week-
end may typify the Lady Panthers’
season so far. The Lady Lions took
first and second in two butterfly
events and in diving, giving them

Although she may not admit it,
Lady Panther basketball coach

. two-day stretch, Pitt will travel to
West Virginia for a 1:30 p.m. mat-
Chu_p tomorrow and host Boston
University on Sunday at 2 p.m. in
the Fitzgerald Field House.

Presently, the Lady Panthers are
holding onto a 9-6 record and are

that.

“We swam very well last week-
end,” Belowich said. “My goal
from the beginning of the season
was to see improved times through-
out the season. Against Penn State,
90 percent of the times were sea-V
sonal bests."

However, a lack ofdepth and a
difficult schedule are the causes of
Pitt's. unusually poor dual-meet
record.

“Most schools don't swim as
tough of a scheduleias we do,”
Belowich said. “We don't have an

‘easy meet.”

Nevertheless, the team has tal-
ent. Jan Ujevich and Sue Heon
continue to perform up to the
standards
swimmers of the past.

Ujevich came within three-

' tenths of a second of qualifying for

Nationals in the 100-yard individ-
ual medley and 50-yard freesyle and
one second away in the 200-yard
breast stroke. The senior captain
has won every event she has com-
peted in this season.

She also finished first in the 400-

of 4:34-14 seconds ‘ ahead of
second place.

“Their performance against
Penn State showed what classy
swimmers both of them are," Belo-
wich said.

The freshman class Belowich
recruited has started to show divi-
dends for the team. Alicia Dugan
has been the most promising so far.
Dugan won the 200-yard
freestyle—an event she had not
swam during the first part of the
season—.with a time of 1:56, four
seconds faster than her personal
best. Dugan also finished behind
Ujevich in the 50 and 100-yard
freestyle. '

“She came to age against Penn

Wendy Morgan also swam well,

Wrestlers Face Ashland,

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
will attempt to raise its 4-2 record
tomorrow as they host Ashland
College at the Fitzgerald Field
House at 2 p.m. '

The Panthers, coming off of a
26-12 loss to Cleveland State, will
be trying to avenge last year’s 24-I2
defeat by Ashland.

“We’re really going to have to
hustle to win this match. We have
to be intense,” wrestling coach
Rande Stottlemyer said. “They’re
the kind of team that likes to go
after the big schools.’-’

A definite minus for the Panther

2 squad will be the absense of sopho-

more Doug Haines at the 158 lb.
weightyqclass. Haines injured his
knee against Cleveland State and

was forced to default. He could be A

out of the lineup for several weeks.

“We're losing one of the guys
who is capable of big points," Stot-
tlemyer said. “Even in a slump,
Doug helps us out. It takes a good
kid to beat him.”

At 118 lbs., freshman Kyle Nellis
(ll-3) will get a rematch of this
year’s Ohio Open Wrestling Tour-

I By SEAN BARNES

One could argue that the Pitt
Panther swim team doesn't have
the depth that its Eastern competi-
tion has, but even the skeptic can't
complain about Panther swimmer
Don Martin.

Martin was recruited by Pitt
coach Fred Lewis for his cham-
pionship times in the freestyle,
individual medley and breast
stroke, which Martin displayed at
Senior Nationals in high school.
Martin was New Jersey’s fastest

' breast stroker last year and was
among the state’s leading long dis-
tance freestylers.

Martin conveyed his readiness to
swim for Pitt’s team just last Satur-
day in the Panthers’ win over rival
Penn State, where he easily outdis-
tanced his 200-yard breast stroke
competition for a first place finish,
this, after swimming the l,000- and
500-yard freestyle events (a total of
60 laps), earlier in the same meet.

. Martin, who was born in Rhode-
sia, moved to.the United States at
the age of 13 during the period of
political turmoil in Rhodesia. His
two years of swimming came to a

quick halt; his new home in South;
Carolina had no swim club. But 18

months later, Martin's family
moved to New Jersey, giving him
the opportunity to be on the New

_- Jersey Wahoos Swim Club.

a “I missed swimming competi-
tively, and with three close-in-age
sisters and little funds after leaving
Rhodesia, I realized that furthering
my, education would" be tough
without,a scholarship,” Martin
said.

i In New Jersey, under coach
Hugh Merkel, Martin began
weight training and long yardage

swimming at the Wahoos facility. .
“I improved quickly,” Martin»

said. “I enjoyed the competition.”
With the Wahoos, M_agti_n went

als because of his breast stroke tal- '

ent. But in between those two years,
Martin‘ swam at -Pittsburgh’s
U.S.S. Invitational, run by Pitt’s
Lewis in Trees Pool over Christ-
mas vacation.

Martin appreciated Pitt’s swim—\
ming facilities and Lewis’ pro-
gram. His desire to major in
engineering was another factor
leaning him towards Pitt.

“I_ like Fred's training. It's
awfully tough right now, but I
need that background yardage if I
want to accomplish the goals that

Coach Lewis and I have set.”
Among Martin’s goals is going
to Indianapolis at the end of March
for NCAA Division I Nationals to
compete in the 200-yard breast
stroke. His talent in the individual
medley . may also take him to
Nationals, but Lewis will use him
primarily in breaststroke and dis-
tance freestyle in dual meet compe-
tition. Ed Bergan and Dean
Delabertis will cover the individual

medley for now. .

scholarships torecruits. Last year,_ the Panthers defeated George
Mason, which is currently ranked tenth in the country by one
volleyball publication, in four—of-five matches. How they can com-
pete against universities that offer scholarships, how they can con-
sistently be one of the top teams in the east, remains a mystery.

Also strange is how the Panthers" can remain in good spirits
knowing this will be their final season. They have played in just
one tournament—Canada’s Excalibur Classic—and returned home
with a 3-2 record and a fifth place finish. The losses came to
Manitoba——the top—ranked team in Canada, and to tenth—ranked
Waterloo. r‘ ~

Waterloo? Napoleon's last hurrah? It wasn't Pitt’s final stand,
but it isn’t far behind either. *

“We don't have next year to look forward to,” Goldberg said,
“but we’re still playing. . .we still have this year, so I guess it's a little
to look ahead to.

“We have everyone together trying to win. Last year we hadone
or two guys trying to get everyone firedup. This year, everyone’s
running around trying to fire each other up." _

That means 10 players, six of whom are in their first year at Pitt,
all of whom are in their final year of Pitt volleyball. They started
together and will finish together.

“I think we were together from the beginning,” Goldberg said.
“All the first-year players meant that kids came in without havinga
good or bad attitude. .I’d say it has brought us together."

Seezox~Phot9 '
cial moves everyday.
“I will, however, work just as
hard as in the past and even harder

to make this a winning team. That
we’re going for winning the East
and playing in the NCAA’s, that
won't change. We're going to go

out on a winning note."
