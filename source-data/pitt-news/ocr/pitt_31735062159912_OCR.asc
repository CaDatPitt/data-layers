IF Council and Independents
Stage Battle of Pamphlets

An old-fashioned pamphleteer—
ing war has been raging on cam-
pus this week between Interfra-
ternity Council and the new Pitt
Independent Association.

Two mimeographed letters, cir-
culated on campus, were centered

around a column by Gene Wein-~

stein which appeared in The Pitt
News Nov. 7. In his article Wein-
stein blasted the discrimination
policies of the fraternities and
said that a student can get a bet-
ter start at the University by
joining the PIA.£<3‘ A

His column was based upon ‘an

ten by Cyril Wecht in the Octo- '

ber issue of the Panther

IF Council’s letter, written by
President Joe Edmundson and
Public Relations Chairman Jack
Greenberg, claims Weinstein’s‘
story was biased, inaccurate, and
misquoted Wecht. When Coun-
cil’s letter did not appear in The
News, as was asked by the Coun-
cil, it was mimeographed and pass-
ed among the student body.

In an answer‘ to the Council’s
letter, however, the PIA ‘admitted
Weinstein’s mis-quote was inex-
cusable, but claimed that the mis-
take was not deliberate.

Players/1doptGreek Simplicity, C
F ormality, For Coming Show

Grecian simplicity will be the keynote of Oedipus Rex,

Pitt Players production.

Running three nights, Dec. 13, 14, 15, in Foster Memorial,

A.

the show is set in front of the‘

king’s palace in ancient Greece.
All the action will be played
against a background of black
drapes. A series of platforms and
pillars will give the audience a
suggestion of Greek architecture.
Robert J. Prendeville, technical
director of theater, says that this
play will depart from ‘the realistic
and detailed settings used in most
plays; Oedipus Re.7c.will be done

completely in a formalized style. ‘E

Oedipus Rex is the story, writ-
ten by Sophocles, of a king who
unwittingly kills -his father and
marries his mother. .

Crew lists for the production
have been released, according to
Bill Pitchford, publicity manager
of Players.

John Shollar will hold the posi-
tion of stage manager; costumes,
Mary Emmerling; make-up, Hazel
Hallam; properties, Carol Firtell;
and scenery, Ruth Pollock.

Harvey J. Pope, director of the-
ater, is in charge of the produc-

I-|t(eeeping The Record Straight

This column today will be a departure from
those I have written in the past in that I shall
not attempt to make a particular point and carry
it through from start to ﬁnish. I intend, rather, to
work in and about and over the spateof zealous
and partisan mimeographing which broke out this
week.

Neither IF Council nor the
Pitt Independents Association
has gained in stature from their

gandizing. Both letters are the
fruits of misguided individuals,
especially that of the newly-
formed PIA which lowered it-
self to the same level as the
pledges running IF.

The Greeks prefaced ‘their _ ., H
sheet with the statement that “I refused to pub-
lish the letter . . simply because it contained
criticism” of me as an editor. Anyone who is at
all familiar with the contents of this page must
be aware that this is untrue and nothing more

  

~ than an egotistical exaggeration of the importance

of IF’s charges. i

I have never Withheld criticism -of me as an
editor in‘ the Letters column nor have I kept off
the news pages because it was criticism per se.
I refer you to- those‘ people who have criticized
me in the past and to those who have criticized
The News.

They Fumbled the Ball

The fact that IF did not get its letter on this
page is more an indication of inept public rela-
tions than proof that I refuse criticism. They were
given ample encouragement to write their letter
and the promise that it would appear. They "are
well aware that they fumbled the "ball. "

Th criticism in point which they allege I refused
to publish reads: —» . 

“It has been admitted by the Editor of The

Pitt News that he did not so much as read

the article previous to publication.”

' It is not a severe attack ‘nor one which would
cause me sleepless nights. I do not read a great
many of the articles_which appear" in this ,news- ‘
p_aper. Only human, I need not point out that I,
am limited by space and time. ' »

And it happens that I did not read that par-
ticular article,__ but the statement and fact are of
little signiﬁcance. When the IF man found out

ema-nds, it could be a three-way ai'd—-to students, facul-A P    A

Wanna know why you shouldn’t drink in the

A‘ comment by a man who has more than a

' He says: “There is_.no more disgusting sight in
the world than that‘of_a young man leaning weakly
against the wall at the Stadium, bringing up his
lunch ‘and breakfast.” A

The man?’ -He is James Wilson, assistant to_the
superintendent of the Pittsburgh Branch of Pinker-'

—ton’s National Detective Agency Inc.‘

The Pinkerton Agency has had men detailed to
the Stadium for over twenty years and in the last
three years has” policed the. Student‘ section for
drinking.‘ ’ I ' I ., *

could see‘ themselves astPinkerton3s see them, they.

about this little detail, however, he scooped it up
like it was a fumble in the end zone.
I object to that-comment and many other things

in the letter. The statement itself reﬂected not on _

me but on others of, my staff; it was irrelevant
to their reply to the “Jim Crow” letter and was

"of no real importance in the letter or in their

minds for that matter.

The allegation was presented out of con-
text with none of the qualiﬁcations necessary
to give it validity. They used the same meth-
ods of distortion and deception they were at-
tacking. The letter itself contained a mistate- _
ment of fact, something about which they 4
howled indignantly in" the column. Gene Wein-
stein is not the public relations chairman of
PIA as they claimed. _ I -

Finally the letter itself contained something
which we call “poor taste” in the journalistic
world and which, I believe, is generally regarded
in the same light, in other areas. I would not run a
letter by anyone who called another person a liar.

A Juvenile Approach . .

While I deplore the juvenile approach, of IF,
I do not excuse the error made by the columnist.

IFisays “we cannot condone this ‘journalistic’ prac- '

tice.” Distortion and misquoting are not journal-
istic practices and certainly not Pitt News prac-
tices. ‘ .
The authors of the mirneographed sheet say
that we ‘did injustice to over 1000 men represent-
ing Pitt?s interfraternity ‘system. Their point seems
to be that the‘ msiquote is sufficient to ruin the re-
mainder of the column. I need not point out that
this is not the case. A

The justice-or injustice -of the real body of
the column must rest upon its merits. There are
a great many people who hold that he hit the
nail on the head. Others say he was wrong.

Organizations generally contain within them-
selves the seeds of their own destruction. Appar-
ently IF is aware of this and they are overly sen-
sitive to any sort of criticism. -

They would have been much better off if they
had ignored the whole thing. The letter as they
published it has brought more discredit and more
ridicule than. anything they could have done. They

have wrecked their public relations with the Uni-

versity and revealed that the really capable mem-
bers of the fraternities are shunning their own gov-
erning body.

self a good time, Wilson says. .

The liquid inside a bottle is not the only dari-
gerous thing the Pinkerton man pointed out.

“A ﬂying bottle, a jagged ch_unk‘of broken glass,
or a beer can underfoot, can be dangerous to
others.” _

He cited the case of a coed who was struck on
the head by a ﬂying wine jug in the stadium
several years ago.

The jug was hurled by an intoxicated student
and the girl was hospitalized.

Can We Stop Drinking -
When questioned about the possibility of curb-

ing or completely eliminating drinking in the T

Ir

Stadium, Wilson had the answer.

“It would be impractical to attempt_ to search
every person entering a football game for a bottle
or ﬂask. Furthermore we don’t employ the search-
ing or “shakedown” methods.
we ask, the student to "dispose of it or not enter
the Stadium." .

“Students themselves, the vast majorityof Whom

don’t drink in the Stadium, should assist in see"- a

ing that all obey the University regulations and
conduct themselves in such a manner as to reflect
favorably on their University.”

‘Coach of champions, winner of champions, and now an_
author—that’s Pitt’s wrestling coach Rex Peery.

Peery’s latest achievement, a handbook called “Wrest-
ling,” is a complete revision of a text written by Peery’s
former coach at Oklahoma A & M, the late Edward C.

 

Gallagher.

1933-35, Peery was three times

' lcalls, “Gallagher has probably the
 coaching record of any mod-
, ern coacl,1,l—-77 consecutive wins in
the 12 years from 1920 to 1932.”

_ ‘In’ his senior year at Oklahoma

Arnold Air Downs Wonders, 32-6,

Arnold Air Society moved

By DON MURDOCK

Sports Editor
Misquotes and exaggerations have been the cause of
plenty of trouble in the past but on-Monday a downtown
paper exaggerated but only caused a few raised eyebrows and

a lot of needless comments.
At the Jaycee weekly Quar-
terback Club dinner on Monday
Captain Tom Hamilton was
quoted as saying that it is the
. policy of the Athletic Commit-
tee to give Pitt people ﬁrst con-
sideration for the head footba
coaching post. ’
The story was topped with a
headline reading-——Pitt Hints
Alumnus To Get Grid Job. _

' Just Filling ' Space

Immediately the thought came
to Pitt students and district fans
that Johnny Michelosen, Edgar
Jones, Biff Glassford, or Eddie
Baker was the man for the job.

But this isn’t the case.

First Hamilton has no author-
ity just now as to who will be
the man. The applicants are
ﬁrst screened through the Ath-
letic Committee which will meet
next month.

Secondly, Captain Tom was just
using a clever way to say ‘no com--
ment’. What kind of a school
would Pitt be if it didn’t give its
alumnus extra consideration? But
this doesn’t mean that an ‘alumnus
is ticketed for the position. Not by
a longshot.

Pure Speculation

Through common courtesy the
Panther brass will give a Pitt grad
ﬁrst consideration, but as far as
hinting that he will get the job is
nonsense. V

Any comment on Pitt’s next
football coach is simply specula-
tion. Pitt is worrying more on

how to win the next three games
on its schedule before looking
ahead to the 1952 grid cam-
paign.

A University spokesman‘ sums
up the situation nicely by saying,
“It’s pure speculation. When the
Athletic Committee sits down to
look over applications there’ll
probably be 400 would-be coach-
es."

Detrimental to Football Team
!Lowell ‘Red’ Dawson for coach?
Right now Dawson is probably
more interested in keeping the
Michigan State Spartans in the na-
tional spotlight than inthe head
coaching post at Pitt. .

One thing is certain. All the
huff—puff about the coaching job
isn’t doing this year’s football
team any good. In the football
season stick with football, after
the season is the time to bite ﬁnger
nails in picking the new coach.

SS Onyx Gain
Playoff Finals

The SS Onyx Club unveiled an
outstanding passing duo in Ronnie
Bentz and Al Condrac Tuesday, as
they moved into the Independent
League . ﬁnals by defeating the
Yanks, 33-19.

In the ﬁrst half Andy Mama-
relli fell on a safety and gathered
in a 20-yard touchdown aerial
from Condrac for the Onyx Club.
Joe Bronder heaved to Sam Rago
for the Yanks’ only second quarter
score to make it, 9-7, at halftime.

Condrac and Bentz opened up in
the second half to connect for
three of four Onyx TD’s. George
Raynovich ruined all hope of a
Yank victory as he intercepted
Bronder’s last-play desperation
heave and went all the way to
paydirt making the ﬁnal score,
33-19.

There’s an organization here on the Pitt campus that
is doing a lot to further world peace and understanding.
It’s the college-age division of the National Conference
of Christians and Jews, an interracial, interreligious, and

intercollegiate organization.

The group was founded in 1949
by a- group of college freshmen,
who felt a need for a continuation
of the Council‘ on Intercultural
Education, to which they had be-
longed 111 high school.

Promotes Good Relations
The purpose of the college age
division, according to Allan Reu-
ben, president, is “to promote in-
terfaith and intergroup relations

among ourselves and others.”
During the ﬁrst year of its ex-
istence, the group worked on the
ﬁrst aspect of its purpose, that of
getting -to know the individual

. members and the kinds of people

they represent. _

This year’s program, too, is being
expanded to fulﬁll the second. part
of the Conference purpose, that of
promoting healthy intergroup re-
lations among others.

Free Speech Squabble at OSU

By GENE WEINSTEIN

For the past few years

controversies over academic

freedom on the campuses have swept the nation. Last year
the problem brushed Pitt students with. the near passage of
the Pechan Bill, which would have compelled loyalty oaths

from all employees of state sup-GI

ported institutions.

Latest of the academic freedom
disputes is the ﬁght between the
board of trustees of Ohio State
versus student, faculty, and other
public groups.

Educational Radical

It all started when Dr. Harold
Rugg, professor emeritus at Teach-
ers College, Columbia University,
accepted an invitation to speak
before the student body. Rugg is
considered by some to be an “edu-
cational radical.”

The Ohio State Board of
Trustees, prompted by several
Columbus newspapers, put their
collective foot down. The trus-
tees ruled that all speakers must
be cleared by the President’s
office.

Then Dr. Cecil Hinshaw, a
Quaker paciﬁst, was denied per-
mission to speak-» at the University.
This was followed by a directive
stating that all questionnaires pre-
pared by any University employee

must be submitted for approval to
the president’s office. '

F a c u 1 t y members considered
both rulings violations of their
right of free inquiry. _

Religion-in-Life Week Cancelled

The University Religious Coun-
cil unanimously decided that as
long as the screening rule was
maintained, the Religion-in—Life
Week would not be held.

On Nov. 7 Dr. Howard Bevis,
president of the University, re-
laxed the controversial screen-
ing rule. Excluded from the
process were speakers invited
to appear by professional groups,
‘by the faculty, and by recog-

nized religious groups.

The compromise failed to quiet
the clamor. The trustees defended
the rulings as a means of keeping
“subversive elements” off campus.

AAUP Against Rule

The Council of the American
Association of University Profess-
ors warned that “the trustees’ ac-
tion was subversive of the func-
tions of a free university in a free
society.”

As this is written, the warring
factions are groping for a satis-
factory middle ground. Yet
neither appears likely to give in
on fundamental issues.

For Owl Pix S

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes-
day“ are the last three days the
Owl photographer will be taking
portraits to be published in the
1952 Owl.

Owl publicity director Bob Bar-
ner emphasized that relatively
few seniors have bothered to make
picture appointments, even though
they need not buy the yearbook.

Undergraduates w h o h a v e
bought Owls may have their pic-
tures in the book also, but many,
Barner says, have either not made
appointments or failed to show up
for_ their appointments. Students
should reschedule these appoint-
ments immediately at the Student
Desk, says the Owl oiﬁcer.
