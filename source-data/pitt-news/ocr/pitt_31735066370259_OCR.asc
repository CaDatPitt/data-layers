Spaceshuttleexplosion claims crew of 7

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

At approximately 11:30 a.m. EST,
yesterday, the space shuttle Challenger
exploded in a tremendous ﬁreball less
than two minutes after taking off from
Cape Canaveral, Fla. The_cause of the
explosion is yet unknown.

All seven crew members aboard the
shuttle were killed when the blast rip-
ped through the craft. Debris continued
to fall for some 30 minutes after the ex-
plosion, preventing emergency ships
and helicopters from immediately
reaching the fallout area miles from
shore.

On board the shuttle were Com-
mander Francis “Dick" Scobee of _

Convicts raise funds  
for transplant patient

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

David Pinder, the 18-month-old
child who received a liver transplant on
Sunday, thanks to the inmates of the
correctional facility where‘ David’s
father works, was listed in critical but
stable condition yesterday afternoon in
the intensive ‘care unit at Children’s
Hospital.

After waiting eight to nine~._months
for the transplant, David underwent the

' 7 1/2-hour operation which, according to

hospital spokesman Lynn McMahon,
must have been a “clean procedure”
because “generally, transplant opera-
tions take approximately 12 hours.”

Transplant surgeon Dr. ‘ Thomas
Starzl performed the operation which
was necessary because David was suf-
fering from biliary atresia, which

causes a blockage of the bile ducts..

David had undergone two prior opera-
tions in England. However, the
transplant was performed at Children’s
Hospital because ‘in England, this type
of transplantation is considered rare
and risky.

A fund-raising campaign was
organized by juveniles in the correc-
tional facility where Mr. Pinder works.
This campaign became very popular in

England, with many celebrities in-
cluding singer Paul McCartney and ac-
tor Stacy Keach making contributions.
The juveniles gathered funds from a
marathon which they sponsored and,
according to the Post-Gazette, from
saving their weekly work wages which
amounted to $3.70 for each juvenile.

The goal of the campaign was to col-
lect 250,000 pounds. The amount col-
lected over a six-month time span was
270,000 pounds or $400,000 in
American currency. The amount raised
was sufﬁcient for Mr. and Mrs. Pinder
along with their oldest son,.Stephen,
age five, to accompany David to Pitts-
burgh, according to the Post-Gazette.

David will be in the intensive care
unit for another eight to 10 days, and
then moved to a regular room to
recover for ﬁve to eight weeks de-
pending on his condition, McMahon
said. He will be discharged to the Pitts-
burgh area to continue his treatment on
an outpatient basis so that his progress
can be monitored. ‘

David is expected to continue
recovering to be a healthy, normal
child. He will have to take anti-
rejection drugs for the remainder of his
life, however. In this type of transplant
operation, one year is considered by
doctors to be the “bench mark” of
recovery.

A memorial service for Pitt pro-
fessor Victoria L. Green, who died
on Jan. 15 after a brief illness, will
be held on Tuesday, Feb. 4 at 4
p.m. in Heinz Chapel.

Green was an associate professor
for 10 years in the School of Health
Related Professions. Green,
formerly of Sewickley, was a
member of the advisory group for
professional personnel for the
Sewickley Valley Hospital Home
Health Agency. She was also a

' member of the American Physical
Therapy Association and the Pitts-

Memorial service planned

volatile liquid oxygen and hydrogen,
exploded immediately after a small ﬁre
appeared at the base of one of the solid
fuel rocket boosters. The shuttle orbiter
itself is attached to the main fuel tank
with the two smaller solid fuel rockets
on either side.

Up until this shuttle ﬂight, which is
no. 25, no major accidents have oc-
curred in the program.

Jesse Moor, director of the Lyndon

, B. Johnson Space Center, held a press

conference yesterday afternoon. He

said, “I am aware [of] and have seen
the media’s footage of the launch to-
day. We will not speculate as to the
specific cause of the explosion based
on that footage."

Moor announced that an immediate
investigation into the cause of the
disaster had begun and only that in-
vestigatory committee will report ‘on
any conclusions. He added that all in-
formation relevant to the investigation,
from Challenger’s instrument records
to launch team workers’ notes, were
being impounded.

The tragedy of yesterday’s dramatic
event drew perhaps more despair than
expected because of the death of crew
member Christa McAuliffe, a social
studies teacher from Concord, N.H.

McAuliffe was to be the first U.S.
citizen not directly afﬁliated with

NASA to reach outer space. Students
of the Concord school where
McAuliffe taught were watching the
live broadcast at the time of the
explosion.

Responding to the tragedy, President
Reagan cancelled his scheduled State
of the Union address and made a
special broadcast from the Oval Office.
Reagan called the disaster “truly a na-
tional loss.” -

Regular programming in Europe was
interrupted to report the explosion, and
Soviet_television transmitted video
footage of the event during its nightly
news. .

French President . Mitterand sent
Reagan a telegram, which stated: “It
has always been the fate of courageous
people, discoverers of new worlds, to

pay such a heavy price for progress.” I

Stress management free for students

By Michele A. Watkins
For The Pitt News

All Pitt undergraduate and graduate
students can take advantage of a free
stress management program offered by
the Student Health Service’_s Health
Education Office this term.

“It’s a good resource, and the price
is right [free]." said Joseph Thaner,
who instructs the program.

Thaner explained that everyone ex-
periences stress, and seeking better
ways to handle it “doesn’t mean
weakness.” Since college is a time of
transition and new-found freedom for
many students, stressful academic, and
social decisions have to be dealt with.

Thaner noted that many coping
mechanisms, such as drugs. alcohol,
smoking, overeating and even sleeping,
are common outlets for stress-.

However, he hopes to provide alter-
native solutions through_his ﬁve-part

_ program designed to accommodate

various schedules. Thaner offers each
session six times throughout the

I 4 -semester -—.»_on Monday afternoons,
Cewedjnesday I'eve_iiii_igs_ and Thursday

  
 
 

afternoons. Every week, students can

’ choose the session that best ﬁts their

schedules. _

Each informal session lasts about one
hour. “It’s a chance one hour a week
to stop and look at yourself and take
a time out,” Thaner said.

Thaner also said he believes the
relatively Sl'lOI’t time required to learn
the stress management techniques is a
good investment for career-minded col-
lege students. “You’ll take it [effective

.stress management] with you into the
work world, too,” he said.

The first weeks session is aimed at
stress awareness. “I try to’ get people
to look at what’s causing stress and
what its symptoms are," Thaner said.
Many common stress symptoms that
are often overlooked include‘ irritabili-
ty, fatigue and accident proneness.

In the past, Thaner has found iden-
tifying “stressors. and symptoms” to
be a good opening technique. Students

welcome the opportunity to air their
sources of stress, he said. '

“Much of the student’s stress is
situational,-” he explained. A new

‘roommate, ﬁnals week and even‘
, Christmas all‘ present stress, for exam-

r

   

ple, and it is not abnormal to feel their
pressure.

l

The second stress management ses-

sion provides “an explanation of the
stress response" to show “what the

body goes through in a stress situa-'
tion,” Thaner said. He incorporates-

relaxation exercises based primarilyeon

mental imagery and deep-breathing‘

techniques.

The program’s third session explores
how rational and irrational thoughts
dominate responses from stress. “It
isn’t so much the events in our lives,
but how we perceive them that deter-

‘ mine how stress will affect us,” Thaner

said. «

For example. if a student perceives
his self-worth as dependent. upon his
ability to excel in all areas, then every
single task» he attempts is highly signiﬁ-
cant. In other words, he may perceive
each test as a threat to his self-worth.
The resulting stress is not_actually caused
by the test itself, but by the student’s
underlying irrational perception that he.
must be outstanding in allsubjects. A
more rational acceptance of_ personal

. strengths and weaknesses would reduce

station is quoting Col. Moammar
Khadafy as calling President Reagan
“power mad.” The report said
Khadafy told a group of foreign
residents of Tripoli Monday night that
the U.S. air maneuvers off the Libyan
coast threaten the freedom of his peo-
ple. Libya is still holding ﬁrm to its
assertion that the entire Gulf of Sidra
is off-limits to foreign vessels, although
the United States still says Libyan
sovereignty ends at the 12-mile limit
recognized by international law. Two
U.S. aircraft carrier task forces are
continuing exercises in the area.

Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi
reports a peace offer from Libyan
leader Khadafy. Khadafy asked for a
guarantee that the United States will not
attack Libya. If Reagan agrees, Craxi
said Khadafy will ask Arab terrorists
not to attack targets in Europe.

‘ ‘Pass. Laws’ ’
make labor pools

Amnesty International said South
Africa’s feared “Pass Laws” only
serve to create a forced labor pool that
is easily exploited by the white minori-

Libya —- The ofﬁcial Libyan radio

Khadafy: Reagan is power mad

ty. South African blacks over the age
of 13 have to carry passbooks at all
times. Failure to do so can lead to ar-
rest and a later work “parole.”

Gemayel fights
call for his ouster

Lebanon — Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel is ﬁghting demands for
his ouster and has sent representatives
to talk to his opponents. The Christian
president is under ﬁre for opposing a
peace agreement accepted by Moslem
leaders. A new cease-ﬁre has halted ar-
tillery and machine gun exchanges be-
tween Moslem militias and army troops
that left at least six people wounded.

Hubbard dies
at age of 74

L. Ron Hubbard, the science ﬁction
writer who founded the controversial
Church of Scientology, is dead at age
74. A church official said a coroner had
identiﬁed the body as Hubbard’s. Hub-
bard had not been seen in public for the
last ﬁve years, and rumors of his death
had often circulated.

Tutu denounces
segregation laws

South Africa — Bishop Desmond
Tutu said if South Africa does not
change its segregation laws signiﬁcant-
ly, he will call for worldwide economic
sanctions. Merely calling for sanctions
openly is against South African law. He
demanded the changes by the end of
March while speaking to reporters after
returning to South Africa from a tour
of the United States.

White House denies
aiding KGB official

WASHINGTON — White House of-
ﬁcials deny reports that the CIA helped
a high-ranking Soviet KGB ofﬁcial
defect to the United States last year.
The New York Times said the defector
was giving U.S. intelligence ofﬁcials
“much more important” information
than anything double-defector Vitaly
Yurchenko gave to the CIA. One
Reagan administration source sug-
gested the story was “disinformation"
planted by the Soviets.

Arafat, Hussein
agree on peace pact

AMMAN, Jordan — PLO sources
said Yassir Arafat and Jordan’s King
Hussein agreed on a new plan for peace
in the Middle East during their meeting
last weekend in Amman. PLO sources
said the proposal includes U.S.
recognition of the Palestinians’ right to
self-determination in return for the
PLO’s acceptance of UN resolutions
which implicitly recognize Israel’s
right to exist.

The sources said a U.S. envoy was
headed to Bonn to present the new pro-
posal to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, who is visiting West Germany.
Jordanian ofﬁcials said Hussein will ﬂy
to Cairo to-present the new peace pro-
posal to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarek after Arafat leavesvAmman.

Sources in the Jordanian capital,
however, said King Hussein has re-

-_ jected conditions imposed by the PLO

for it to recognize Israel.

Binational med student receives award

By Michelle Zollner
 Staff Writer

Michael J. Van Duren is the recipient
of the Allegheny County Medical
Society 1986 Medical Student Award
which will be presented at the ACMS
dinner this evening.

Van Duren, who calls himselfa dual
citizen of the United States and the
Netherlands. is a fou__rth—year student at
the University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine.

The Medical Student Award
recognizes students like Van Duren
who have outstanding academic abili-
ty, personal traits and extracurricular
service.

'.g.;'_

Van Duren’s freshman year of his"

undergraduate education was com-
pleted at Aloyfius College in the

Netherlands. Through a scholarship
awarded from the Netherlands
American Council of Educational Ex-
change, Van Duren completed "his
undergraduate studies at Dickinson
College and Lebanon Valley College.
both located in Pennsylvania.

After completion of his
undergraduate studies in the United
States, Van Duren returned to the
Netherlands to study at the University‘
of Nymegein Department of Medicine.

In the fall of 1982, in the continua-
tion ofhis medical training, Van Duren
entered Pitt‘s medical program.

In addition to his educational
achievements, he also has the Medical
Student Awards standard of “unques-
tioned integrity,” and the quality of
“unfailing diligence, dependability and
conscience," as described by Dr. Louis
Pounds, M.D.. associate dean of stu-

dent affairs of the School of Medicine.
in his nomination letter. '

Van Duren’s life has also included
numerous community service ac-
tivities. As vice'president of Pitt’s
American Medical Student Association
he planned a curriculum for a teenage
pregnancy program for the March of
Dimes.

In 1983 and 1984 Van Duren was the
official delegate to the AMSA national
convention. He was the president of the
Christian Medical Society and also
planning and committee chairman for
a project to develop a free clinic for
unemployed steel workers and their
families. "

In the near future. Van Duren has the
opportunity of studying medicine in
Kenya, East Africa, as a result of the
Reader‘s Digest International
Fellowship — MAP.

‘ Physicssociety receives grants

By Susan Felder
‘ For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh chapter
of the Society of Physics Students has
received two grants through the Na-
tional Office of the Society of Physics
Students. The grants will be used to
conduct research projects during 1986.

The Marsh W. White Award was
presented to the Pitt chapter for a proj-
ect titled, ‘ ‘High.School Interaction and
Public Lectures on Physics.”

Chapter « president Michael
Blaszkiewiczi is organizing this pro-
gram. It willconsist of evening lectures
on ways in which physics touches our

- everyday lives. Some of the topics of

the lectures include: astronomy, lasers, '

black holes, photography, nuclear
power risk and risk aversion. The lec-
tures will be taking place some time at
the end of March and the beginning of
April.

“We’ll need the money [from the
award] mostly for advertising and get-

ting people to come [to the lectures]” '

said Blaszkiewicz. “It’s not just for
Physics‘ students, but also for the
general public. It’s a kind of awareness
program.”

The students’ proposal, “Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh Telescope Project,”
received special recognition and a cash
award of $450 in the 1986 Allied
Awards which are supported by the
Allied Corporation Foundation.

A group of six students are working
on this project. They are in the process

of building a small radio telescope to
view solar activity. The six students are
Mike Hamuicka, Bill Pantis, Frank

Loreti, Vivienne Shaffer, Matthew
Tolbert and John Barriano.

When they are finished with the
telescope they plan to take it to a roof

of one of the Pitt buildings and view
the galaxy from there. Afterward they

plan to take it to “somewhere like _

Ohiopyle,” according to Pitt physics
professor Julia Thompson.

The Allied Award Program was

started 23_ years ago by the Bendix Cor-.
poration and was formerly known as
the Bendix Award. The Marsh W.
White award was named in honor of
Mr. White for his 40 years of service
of Sigma Pi Sigma, the physics honor
society. ~

Chaos In Latin America

The nations of Latin America have long been
torn by the ravages of political violence and revolu-
tion. For reasons that will probably never be_fully
understood, politics in Latin America have been
tragically marked by a long—standing tradition of
violent redress of grievances. In the midst of the
ongoing upheaval, the reign of political regimes —
whether democratic, authoritarian, dictatorial, or
Marxist — is often transient. That is‘, short—lived.

Revolutionary ideals are so ﬁrmly entrenched in
Latin America that it has become foolhardy for out-
siders to attempt to inﬂuence outcomes or events.
Any American policy of intervention in the politics
of Latin America‘, then, is likely to fall short of its
aims. Much as we might regret it, American power
is insufficient for the task of imposing order in our
neighboring lands. ,

One of the greatest fears expressed by the cur-

V rent administration is that unless America in-

tervenes, the countries of Latin America will fall
to communism one by one. But is this likely when
nearly every ostensibly Marxist regime or revolu-
tionary movement is merely a masquerade of sorts?
After all, history provides ample evidence that, in
spite of good intentions, the governments that come
to power in Latin America — whether they be
American or Soviet supported, or claim to uphold

Marxist or democratic ideals — often become
totalitarian and are far beyond the control ‘of exter-
nal powers. .

Ironically, American policy in Latin America
often provides impetus for what it is expressly
designed to prevent. By supporting unpopular
regimes or revolutionary movements with limited
grass-roots support, American policy frequently
leads opposition Marxist-led factions to turn to the
Soviet Union for the means with which to counter
imported American military hardware and know-
how, It is uncertain what shape American policy
in Latin America should take, but it is readily ap-
parent that the currentcourse is inappropriate.

What Is Life?

The column by Charles Ward,
“Abortion: A Moral Dilemma,” was
surprisingly ignorant of the scientiﬁc
facts that deﬁne the beginning of life.

According to science, the indivisible

unit of life is the cell. Scientists know’

that a single cell means life; fur-
thermore, even bacteria or viruses are
considered as life. What makes a cell
different from another? There are many
answers for this question, but the most
important one is its DNA or genetic in-
formation. The cell that is formed from
an egg and sperm contains the DNA of
both the male and the female and it is
a distinct living organism.

It is not a part of the mother’s body.
A fact that demonstrates this point is
the immunological system of the
mother and the unborn child. Most of
the time the immunological systems are
totally different, even to the point that
at times they fight each other.

Another fact of this independence has
been experimentally proved by the suc-
cessful implantation of the so called
“test—tube babies.” Also, there is really
no argument whether the life is a
human life (certainly it is not a
monkey). The DNA confirms this
point.

Regarding the argument about the
accumulation of unwanted babies, it
has to be remembered that, for a
believer, when God creates human life,
at least He wants it. If someone wants
it, let us try to find better ways to care
for it as a society. rather than encourag-
ing the unwilling mother to simply

Soviet Cruelty

In regard to the Jan. '22 Pitt News
editorial entitled “Eternal Vigil," may
I recommend that in the future the
editorial staff think twice (or better yet,
at least think once) before authoring
such a misguided and ignorant piece‘ of
nothingness.

I quote from the Jan. 22 editorial:
“The Soviet Union is generally a
passive, status quo power much like the
United States. It has neither the
resources nor the will to engage in con-
flicts throughout the world. It does not
want to conquer the world; it merely
wants to ensure its own continued ex-
istence. Is that so very evil?” Is it so
evil? Well, it depends on whether or
not you consider gulags to be evil, or
sending dissenters to insane asylums,
or  It is a mark of this era’s moral
relativism that the status quo can
outweigh evil.

The editorial ridicules the president
for calling communists evil. Well, of
course not all communists are evil, but
that is not the point. The point is that
communism is a system that allows evil
to ﬂourish. Stalin is the prime exam-
ple. He did unspeakable things, things
totally without precedent, and it was the
Soviet system that enabled him to do
it. While it is true Stalin is dead, it is
also true that many aspects of Stalinism
have been institutionalized into the
Soviet system. This, then, is the Soviet

This does not mean that we should

tional arena, and it would be unwise to
base our policy on morals. But we must
also remember that our system 15

Poorly Equipped

I would like to come to the defense
of our campus police because of an in-
cident I witnessed that appalled me.
These police are on our campus to pro-
tect us, but they don’t even have func-
tioning equipment in order to protect
themselves. _

On Jan. 11 three ofﬁcers got in-
volved in a fight that required more
backup. The one officer able to do so
called for help three times on his radio,
and nobody responded. They were later
told that the message had never been
received! As a result of this malfunc-

-tioning radio, these three officers had
to be treated in the hospital.

The officers said they were using
equipment that 12 years ago was
technologically advanced but had now
become outdated. How can the univer-
sity expect to have a protective police
force if they don’t even supply them
with useful, updated equipment?

Are you a frequent “Letter to the

to limit your responses to a page or

kidding in our ads asking you to
write for The Pitt News?

If you said “Yes,“ you should
consider becoming one of our
columnists.

First. writing opinion columns is
more fun than writing letters to the
editor. No longer will you be just
a response: instead. you can be a
stimulus. ‘

Second. your work will receive
more careful editorial attention.
(Ever read a letter to the editor that
ended funny? It was probably be-
cause the layout people just put in
the paragraphs that would ﬁt an

Third. you can choose to write

law saying you can‘t write us if you
like something you read in this

If you decide to take this advice

what you paid’ for it), you will need
a dictionary (for spelling and mean-
ing), a thesaurus (for synonyms).

and. of course. an imagination.
Then. pick a topic and write a "
manuscript from two to three pages
long. For best results. put it away
for at least 24 hours and then

‘ review it. Then re-write and review

it again. at least once. Then ask
yourself. “Did I have fun writing
this?" If not. don't submit it. (I
once violated these last two ”

Once it's published you will have
the joy of seeing your own creation
in print. You will also learn that a
lot can be lost in translation from
brain to manuscript to newsprint,
and that will drive you to do better
next time. You may also be sur-
prised at the reaction to your work:
People will tend to disagree with
what they ‘read into it rather than
with what you really said, especial-
ly if you like to pull your reader's
leg. as I sometimes do. You may
also find it strange to see that some
of your friends will write nastier
letters to the editor about your work
than strangers will. (It’s amazing
what some people will do just to get
the ﬁfteen minutes of fame that An-
dy Warhol promised them.)

. So think’ about it. especially if
you‘ve ever said to yourself. “I

Thaner gears his fourth session to the

Thaner also emphasizes assertiveness

students often have a tendency to
passively accept whatever comes

“You’ll never know if you don’t ‘

Thaner, a graduate student in Pitt’s
health administration program, said he
has gotten “a good feel for stress”

through his previous clinical
experiences.

As a therapist at Mon-Yough Com-
munity Mental Health's Day Treatment
Center, he worked with mentally ill pa-

basis. He explained that the mental
health therapist becomes very familiar
with stress, because detecting
“stressors and symptoms” is a key part
of the job.

Study Abroad scholarship

By Teresa Candori
For The Pitt News

Applications are still being accepted
for the Nationality Rooms Summer
Study Abroad Scholarships. Fourteen
scholarships, three for graduate
students and 11 for undergraduates, are
currently being /offered for study in
foreign countries. a

James Hitt, a junior philosophy ma-
jor, says he had considered study
abroad before he knew about the
scholarships but hadn’t the means to
go. “I was thinking about the S.S.
Universe — the Semester at Sea —— but
it was too expensive."

Hitt has applied for the David L.
Lawrence Award and the Rachel
McMasters Miller Hunt Award. If
chosen, he will travel to the Universi-
ty of Warwick for a five-week inten-

sive study of “Courts, Rules and Con-
flicts.” I

Applicants must be full-time students
at Pitt. Undergraduates must have be-
tween 60 and 90 credits by April, and
graduate students must be carrying nine
credits. Deadline for applications is
Friday at noon.

Most of the approximately 160 ap-
plicants for this year’s scholarships are
juniors, according to E. Maxine
Bruhns, director of the Nationality
Rooms and Cultural Exchange Pro-
grams. Of these, no more than six

finalists for each of the 14 scholarships ~

will be chosen based upon a prelimi-
nary interview.

The most important considerations,
advises Ms. Bruhns, are academic
record and a background that will
enable the student to get the most out
of studyabroad. “The ideal person is
someone who is a major in the subject
they’ve chosen. For example, language

is a natural,” said Ms. Bruhns.
However, past winners have come out
of all departments of the university.

Applicants for the scholarships must
select a credit-worthy study program
of no less than five weeks abroad. The
program must be relevant to their
career goals or may be an independent
research project supervised by a Pitt
faculty member. Anyone who applies
for one of the scholarships must have
been enrolled at Pitt for the fall and
winter terms just before the summer
abroad, and he or she must return to
Pitt immediately following study for
two consecutive terms.

Upon returning, the students must
notify their committees by telephone.
A complete evaluation report must be
submitted in September and informal
reports must be presented to the com-
mittees. A panel discussion is usually
held at a meeting of the Nationality
Council in early fall.

War games In

By William Young
Staff Writer

Have you ever thought that Napoleon I

conducted the Battle of Waterloo all
wrong? Or that Hitler’s campaign in
Russia was poorly led? Or even that the
United States could have won in Viet-
nam if they’d had a different strategy?
Questions like these burn endlessly in
the minds of most armchair generals as
they criticize the judgment of soldiers;
they feel they could have done better,
if only they had been in charge.

If you happen to be one of these ann-

~-.29,‘ chair generals, you don’t need to

/

wonder anymore. A plethora of
historical recreation games exist to
satisfy any person’s taste. You can
command American minutemen in the
Battle of Lexington, French cavalry in
the Battle of Marengo, or German
panzers in the Battle of Kursk.
Whatever your favorite battle may be,
you can probably find a game that
covers it.

Table-top wars such as these are not
merely re-enactments of what was ac-
tually done, but rather a re-creation of

~51 the events leading up to the conﬂict.



What happens once the game begins is
up to the players, as they have the op-
tion to do whatever they please. This
ﬂexibility in troop movement allows
for nearly any conclusion — luck per-
mitting, of course.

Games of these sorts rely on two
basic concepts: skill and luck. Skill
depends primarily upon a player’s
ability to grasp the practices of tactics.
strategy and his ability to use them.
This is to say that a person’s skill is ex-
hibited in how he moves his pieces and
why he moves them the way he does.
A player cannot just move his units
helter-skelter.

Luck is a little bit more difficult to
control. In nearly every game
everything boils down to a simple roll
of the die. This die roll re-creates the
uncertainty of battle, allowing for the
human factors, such as morale, that the
cardboard and paper of the game pieces
cannot represent. Luck of the die roll
often can make or break the best cam-
paign, although more skilled players
will lessen the effects of bad luck by
basing the’ r strategies less on luck and
more on their troop maneuvering.

The complexity of these games
varies greatly. Some games are as easy
to learn and play as checkers. Others

are more "difficult to masterthan chess.

Many systems incorporate rules that
allow for increased difficulty as the
players grasp the rudiments of the game
and are ready for advanced play. Near-
ly all games have a list of optional rules
that allow for situations that could have
occurred to effect the battle, but didn’t.

Playing time is another factor in war
games; they take a lot of time. The
more complex a game is, the longer it

 

takes to play. A game covering the Bat-
tle of the Bulge may be played in a
single afternoon, but one covering the
German invasion of the Soviet Union
could take many weeks. In general, the
bigger the scope of the game the longer
it will take to play.

Another aspect of these games is the
size. Whether a player’s passion is to
command a platoon of GIs or an en-
tire army of redcoats, he can ﬁnd a
game on the scale he likes. Most games
are based on a scale with the average
unit being a regiment or division, but
games covering much smaller and

.much larger groupings are readily

available.

Since the games are board games,
their physical size tends to vary
drastically from game to game. Some
games are easily set up on a card table,
while some take up an entire ping-pong
table — it all depends on the battle be-
ing played out. The playing pieces are
generally small (centimeter square)
printed cardboard counters which can
represent one man or a corps of infan-
try divisions. The maps used are usual-
ly divided into a gridwork of inter-
connected hexagons which regulate the
movement of the pieces and organize
terrain features.

These games are not limited to just
ground warfare, either. Many cover
sea and air battles with the same com-
plexity found in land battle games. The
players can ﬂy a WWI biplane over

ay   1.1.... f........d   belligerenits

etc.). the morale of the common soldier "

battle-scarred France or the latest jet-
ﬁghter over the coast of Libya. In many
games all three environments .— air,
sea and land — are taken into account
to re-create a situation more precisely
than if just one component were being
used.

Price is something to take into ac-
count. Most games average between
$15-$30, although some are priced as
high as $60. A suggested test to deter-
mine if a game is worthy of its price
tag is to lift it up and weigh it in your
hand — if it feels like it weighs about
a pound or more it is probably a good
buy; if there seems to be a lot of emp-
ty space inside, then the buyer risks
getting a mediocre game. For the most
part, however, the games are worthy
of their tag; they generally contain col-
orfully detailed maps showing quite an
array of terrain and several hundred
color-coded pieces that do much to
enhance play.

There are several games that have
been noticed for their excellent
playability. Victory Games puts out a
series of games that cover each of
Napoleon's campaigns, including the
Iberian and Russian campaigns, in
great detail. “Squad Leader" deals
with tactics at its lowest level of opera-
tions, that of the men i_n the field and
their struggle to reach the next
hedgerow. Made by Avalon Hill, it in-
corporates nearly every facet of com-
bat: weapons, elite troops (NKVD, SS,

and combat's effect on him.

If you are interested in the second
world war there are games produced
by Games Designer’s Workshop. Their
Europa series covers every theater of
operations except Asia. The game re-
creates the battles at the divisional
level, although a multitude of other
sized units (batallions, regiments,
brigades) exist. The series on a whole
is scaled at the master level. although
a beginner can easily learn the system.
For first-time players, the two recom-
mended games to start with are
“Westem Desert” and “Torch,” both
of which cover the battles of North
Africa from start to ﬁnish.

Prospective pilots should try “Air
Force” (for combat over the skies of
Europe and Africa) or “Dauntless”
(the air war against Japan), both by
Avalon Hill. The games cause the
players to assume theirole of a WWII
pilot in airplane-to-airplane ﬁghting.
These two games are probably the most.
ﬂexible of any game because they
enable the players to match up any
types of planes and do not have rigid‘
pre~written scenarios.

The end result of all this is that chair- ‘
bound commanders need not bicker
about what could have happened “if
only  now they can duke it out in
place of their historical counterparts. '

Super Bowl1986: Did youmiss it?  

By David Zafris

I was fortunate enough to be able to
go to the infamous Super Bowl, and as
I packed my bags, my hands trembled
in anticipation. I boarded the plane and
munched on the gratuity peanuts, my
mind whirling with names, facts and
figures — Jim McMahon, “The

Patriots a wild card pick. Exhilaration
raced through my veins at’ being on

 

hand to view McMahon’s funky style
and Eason’s laid-back, midwestern
form. What joy! What mid-winter
madness.

As it is hard for me to write the
deﬁnitive piece on Super Bowl XX,
here’s a list of observationsl made dur-
ing a hectic week in New Orleans:

0 Whatever happened to parity in the
National Football League? Last year,
San Francisco posted a 15-1 record en
route to their second Super Bowl win,
and this year the Bears dominated the
league like no other team has since the
Steelers of the late 705.

will be a casualty of the NFL rules
committee.

0 New England’s lucky streak that
carried them through the playoffs disap-
peared when Tony Eason fumbled in
the first quarter. The Patriots had six
turnovers to Chicago’s two. The ball
was definitely not bouncing their way.

0 Turnovers weren’t the only reason
for the Patriots’ demise. The Bears
dominated both lines of scrimmage and
nearly doubled New England’s time of
possession.

0 If the Bears are repeat champions
next year, look for some NFL rule
changes prohibiting eight-man defen-
sive fronts. Someday the 46 defense,
like the Steel Curtain of the Steelers,

undergo voluntary drug testing of each
player beginning next season. Maybe
that explains why they couldn’t hold
onto the ball.

0 The Patriots voted Monday to.

0 Both Patriots and Bears players
stated they wanted to win the game for
individual team leaders, but neither
Chicago superback Walter Payton nor
14-year veteran Patriot defensive end
Julius Adams played up to their billing.

0 Payton walked off the field after
the game with his head down and later
complained it was because he didn’t get
any touchdowns. It’s too bad he
couldn’t share in the victory celebration
he worked so long and hard for.

0 While Super Bowl MVP Richard
Dent may be the heart and soul of the
Bears defense, rookie cornerback Reg-
gie Phillips may have had his best game
of the year. Phillips led the Bears with
seven tackles and intercepted a Steve
Grogan pass to run it in for a

touchdown.

0 Bears quarterback Jim McMahon
should have been named Super Bowl
MVP.

0 On Bourbon Street in the French
Quarter, Saturday night before the
game, there were so many people you
could hold your arms out and literally
be carried by the crowd.

0 After hundreds of Patriots and
Bears fans screamed “Let’s go Pats”
and “Let’s go Bears” at each other in

. a futile attempt to be the loudest, the

two rival groups of fans began chant-
ing “tastes great” and “less filling.”
This cheer exemplified the true mean-
ing of a Super Bowl in New Orleans.

0 The Bears’s song “Super Bowl
Shufﬂe” was blaring out of New
Orleans shops and restaurants all week
long.

0 The officiating for the Super Bowl _

was an embarrassment for the NFL.
Not only did they blow the ‘call on
McMahon’s pass to running back Den-
nis Gentry at the one, but they even
botched the coin toss at the beginning
of the game. Walter Payton waited until
the coin landed on the ground before
calling heads or tails.

0 No Super Bowl article would be

Tire’ ‘1>it‘i"Néw§," ranaa’r*y”’2é',"‘1é’§5

complete without something written
about William (Refrigerator) Perry.
But what more can anyone write about
him?

0 Patriot linebacker Don Blackmon
may have had the best day, of anyone
on the field. He covered Payton,
Chicago’s leading receiver, all day
without allowing him one reception.
Blackmon led all tacklers with seven
tackles and one assist and also forced
a Bear fumble.

0 Neither the Bears nor the Patriots
fans can match the enthusiasm and
vociferousness of Pittsburgh Steeler
fans.

0 With people parading up and down
Bourbon Street with drinks in their
hands, the Louisiana state legislature
passed the most trivial of blue laws. No
longer can New Orleans partyers buy

clothes, household appliances or fur-

niture on Sundays. This will surely
cleanse the city of its bad elements.

0 When I pay $26 for a Bears sweat-
shirt, I must shamefull admit that I was
drawn into the Super Bowl hype.

0 Quote of the Week: When asked
if he had any Super Bowl nerf foot-
balls, a New Orleans sales clerk replied
in broken English, “What is a foot-
ball?”

Student opinion

appraisals

By Nadia Moritz

Features Editor and

Kelly 1. Shaffer

Assistant Features Editor

Education has always been seen as
the evaluating of students by teachers.
But when a need arises for the assess-
ing of teachers to improve their sub-
ject matter and teaching styles, who is
to do the judging of teachers? The very
people who are to be educated by them
— the students.

The teacher’s classroom perform-
ance is considered to be the most im-
portant aspect of their duties. In order
to evaluate it, visits by the teacher’s

peers and supervisors are undertaken.‘

However, on a day-to-day basis, it was
suggested that the recipients of his
teaching were the most competent
evaluators.

Therefore, students might be the
cause of the receiving of tenure, or be-
ing denied it. Teacher evaluations are
also the basis for promotions and pay
raises. Decisions are based on student
opinions that might create or destroy
a professor’s career.

Controversy has arisen over the
proper usage of student reports.
Universities and teachers themselves
are questioning the validity and
replicability of these evaluations. It has
become a cause for discussion and
argument on campuses across the
nadon

Teacher evaluations have been
around for about the last 100 years of
American education, throughout which
their purposes have changed frequent-
ly. According to Neild Oldham in his
book “Evaluating Teachers for Per-
sonal Growth,” during the early 1900s,

 bears on faculty

teacher evaluations “were often thinly
disguised weapons for getting rid of
militant or non-conformistteachers, for
slashing budgets, or for enforcing
authoritarianism in the schools.” But
much has changed since then, for the
professors as well as the students. Over
the last 20 years, administrators’ views
on the value and the validity of the
evaluations have changed.

Originally, student evaluations of
teachers were administered in order to
supply sources of information to help
teachers improve their classroom per-
formance. According to Richard Cox,
director of student evaluations at Pitt,
the evaluation system here was im-
plemented about 15 years ago and re-
mains as a method for teacher self-
improvement. “The evaluation
center,” Cox said, “conducted about
1,000 evaluations last term.”

“The primary thing they are used for
is for the individual instructor to judge
and evaluate his or her performance for
individual beneﬁt,” said Cox.

But the importance of teacher evalua-
tions at Pitt, as in many other univer-
sities across the country, is moving
away from classroom performance and
into areas of teaching such as tenure.

“The provost’s policy about making
tenure decisions is that there must be
teacher evaluations for a professor in
order for him to be considered for
tenure,” said Cox. “So the teacher
evaluations are sent along with the
other credentials.”

So the students do have the capacity
to inﬂuence the teaching process out-
side the classroom. According to Ellen
Detlefsen, a member of the Provost’s
Advisory Committee on Women’s
Concerns, student evaluations are one
of the three methods of evaluation for
instructors. The other two are peer
evaluations and supervisor evaluations.

Teacher evaluations, however, are
not required at Pitt.

“Every university does it different-
ly,” said Cox. “Pitt does not have a
policy that makes the actual evaluations
mandatory but there is a mandate that
every school does have a policy on
teacher evaluations.”

Presently about three-fourths of the
departments at Pitt have policies con-
cerning teacher evaluations, according
to Cox. One-fourth does not. A man-
date has been released, said Cox, en-
couraging the development of forms
and evaluation procedures for all
departments. The mandate is listed in
the “University Plan: 1985-1990” as
follows:

“Over the next several years, all in-
structional units will be required to
develop mechanisms for egular stu-

   

 

»”‘Q‘.‘..‘7i’z&c

  

 

dent and peer
undergraduate and graduate instruc-
tion.” ,

According to Cox, the evaluations
are being formulated with input from
teacher and student representatives
from the individual departments.

Another issue surrounding the
development of student evaluations is
the validity of the student view: Are the
students competent enough and serious
enough to be evaluating the perform-
ance of their professors?

According to D.A. Dilts and R.E.
Holtfreter in their 1982 investigation
of the legal aspects of teacher-
performance appraisals, the federal
standards, as outlined in the Uniform
Guidelines on Employee Selection Pro-
cedures “probably are not being met
by college and secondary education ad-

"evaluation of

 

    

ministrators  [when evaluations] are
at least in part based on student ratings
of instructors.” M

I think students are the best possible
evaluators for the things that we ask
them to evaluate,” said Cox. “Things
like clarity, or fairness of tests — I
think the students are the best resources
we have for evaluating these things.”

The fact that the studies done at Pitt
and across the nation indicate no cor-
relation between the grade that students
receive in class and the type of evalua-

- tion they give increases Cox’s trust.

“Students are very consistent in
evaluating the instructors,” said. Cox.
“I think this adds to the value of the
students as evaluators.”

his own system of classroom evalua-

“Yes, the students have to
sit through the classes. Some
are organized and some are
not. They (the students) are
paying good money for their
classes and should have a say
in what goes on there. ”

“Of course you ’re going to
get teachers from either ex-
treme. For the most part,
most people in college are in-
tellects and they judge fair-
ly. ”

Dan Shields

“They re there everyday.
The -teachers are going to
know if someone is sitting in
on their classes or not — so,
in that respect, they are a
good barometer of what the
students feel. ” '

Kurt Shaﬂer
Business, 19

“‘We’re the ones who ac-
tually know what it ’s like to
be taught by that person. We
should try to tell them in the
middle of the course so that
what we say can have some
eﬂect on us. ” 1

tions, said that he feels students are
competent judges, but would not seek
their opinions in all instances.

“Opinions are important." said
Deep. “But ultimately, they aren’t part
of my decision—making concerning the
class. I wouldn't change the course on
the basis of students‘ opinions."

And despite any inﬂuence that the
students may have in the evaluation
process, according to Cox. students
generally have no power over the man-
date aspect of the evaluation system.

“We have some students who have
informally requested to have a teacher
evaluated,” said Cox. “But that is not
part of the system. The backbone of our
system is faculty cooperation. Without
that, the system wouldn’t work at all.“

Junior Andy Hughes said he feels
that the evaluation should serve in more
of a capacity to beneﬁt the students.
“The evaluations aren’t used for the
students the way they should be,” said
Hughes. “If all the bad evaluations
were publicized, students wouldn’t be
ﬁlling lectures that the profs weren‘t
speaking English in."

Senior Kathy Murphy agreed: “The
questions on the evaluations seem rele-
vant but the students never find out the
results. What good could they be?”

Still another controversy of the
teacher evaluations concerns the fac-

tors which inﬂuencc the students dur-
ing the ratings period. Such variables
as class size and whether the class is
required or not can have either an
enhancing or detrimental effect upon
the results of the evaluation, according
to some sources. Others claim that
these things have no effect.

“A lot of studies have been done

“I think students are the
best possible evaluators for
the things we ask them to
evaluate like clarity or
fairness of tests. ”

measuring the relationship of evalua-
tions with majors vs. non-majors,
associates compared to assistant pro-
fessors, upper and lower classmen
ratings as well as the sex of the student
and the sex of the teacher. But general-
ly, no relationship has been established
between any of these.” said Cox.
However. the findings of a study
reported in the New York Times appear
to conﬂict with that opinion. According
to a survey 1,000 students at Lafayette
College in Easton, Pa., female pro-

fessors were rated more harshly by
male students than their male col-
leagues. Female students generally
gave female professors better ratings.
but considered their male teachers to
be better overall.

“We had expected to find some
evidence that the biased attitudes that
still prevail in our society are reﬂected
in the classroom, but we were shocked
at how strong the students‘ prejudices
actually are." said the researchers. Dr.
Susan A. Basow. a pyschology pro-
fessor at Lafayette, and Nancy Silberg,
a graduate.

Dr. Irene Frieze, director of the
women's studies program at Pitt,
agrees. “I have read studies that show
that students have higher expectations
for female teachers than for males,”
she said. “The teacher can’t possibly
meet them, so they are consequently
rated lower.”

According to Randi S. Ellis, a
business professor at North Harris
County College, the correlation of
grades and evaluation results in his
study of faculty appraisals was signifi-
cant; however, they did not prove
cause and effect. He suggested that it
poses possibilities for manipulation of
the ratings systems.

Ellis cites the example of a professor
who confessed to his class that his wife
needed expensive medical treatment.
The possibility of treatment depended

Ellis explained the professor’s ac-

he said, can be affected by the teacher’s
presence in the evaluation area, his in-

' “The mass processing is the most ef-

teachers. Students making critical
remarks during class is infrequent,

Therefore, this is sometimes the only

By John Zaphyr
Assistant News Editor

The Pitt News

Editor ’s Note: This story is one 0f—an
on-going series of articles on the

history of Pitt ’s buildings.

The William Pitt Student Union has
been an Oakland landmark for over 80
years.

The Union, which was once the
Schenley Hotel, was Pittsburgh’s first
skyscraper hotel. The hotel, a classical
10-story structure of brick and stone
over a steel frame, opened in 1898.
Elegantly appointed with marble,
chandeliers and Louis XV architecture, .
the Schenley became the Pittsburgh
home of the rich and famous and the
near-rich and famous.

Presidents Theodore Roosevelt,
Woodrow Wilson, William Howard
Taft and Dwight Eisenhower all signed
the register at the Schenley. Singer-
actress Lillian Russell lived on the-
fourth ﬂoor and married Pittsburgh
publisher Alexander -Moore in the
French Room. Sarah Bernhardt,
Nelson Eddy, Jeannette MacDonald
and Henry Ford stayed at the Schenley.

In 1909, Forbes Field opened just
down the street and the University of
Pittsburgh moved from its Northside
location to Oakland. These two events
were destined to change the hotel

forever. From that time on, the
“Waldorf of Pittsburgh” eventually
became the place National League
baseball players stayed when they came
to town to play the Pirates and became
home to students and faculty of the
university. Added to the register were
such names as Babe Ruth, Casey
Stengel, Ty Cobb and Rogers Hornsby.
For the next 40-plus years, the
Schenley continued to operate on a less
grand scale, and in 1956, the Schenley

Park Hotel was sold to the University

of Pittsburgh to use as its student union. .

While $1 million was spent to renovate
the facility, it remained a hotel-turned-
union for the next 25 years.

However, as the student population
of the Pittsburgh campus grew to over
30,000 and their student activities
diversiﬁed and multiplied, it was clear
that a major overhaul of the structure
was needed.

In 1980, the university announced a
$13.9 million renovation and restora-
tion for the Union, and the facelift was
on. During the 18-month project, seven
upper floors were gutted. They were
replaced with bright, modern offices
for the students and the student affairs
administration.

The Union was named after William
Pitt, who acted as the conciliatory
liaison between England and the col-
onies, later the United States of
America.

William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, was
born in Westminster, England. He was
educated at the University of Oxford,
but was compelled to leave Oxford due
to illness and could not complete his
degree. In 1735 he was elected to the
House of Commons. He displayed re-

is legacy

markable oratorical skills in advocating
the interests of the merchants of
England and of the American colonies,
in opposing various policies of Prime
Minister Sir Robert Walpole and his
successors and in criticizing King
George II. Pitt’s eloquence made him
popular on both sides of the‘Atlantic
Ocean and he became known as “the
Great Commoner.”

Following the accession to the throne
of King George III in 1760, Pitt’s in-
ﬂuence declined. In the following year,
he resigned his office when the king
and his cabinet rejected his advocacy
of war with Spain. In Parliament,
although he opposed independence for
the American colonies, Pitt urged con-
ciliation of the colonies and called for
the repeal of the Stamp Act. In 1766
he was named Earl-of Catham and in
1768 he retired. After delivering a
memorial address in the House of
Lords on behalf of peace with the col-
onies, he suffered an apoplectic seizure
and died a month later. He was buried
in Westminster Abbey. However, his
legacy lives on through the University
of Pittsburgh’s William Pitt Union.

The Pitt News, January 29, 1986

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Pitt
wrestling team, powered by a strong,
late comeback, managed to remain
undefeated last night by tying
Cleveland State, 20-20.

The Panthers trailed 16-7 after six
matches, but Eric Wertz and Mike
Tongel scored consecutive decisions
before Curtis Conner pinned Cleveland
State’s Jay Suvak to put the Panthers
ahead 20-16. State’s Mike Backhcuh
scored a 15-4 major decision over Pitt
freshman Mike Sipos, and the ﬁnal-
score was set, 20-20.

“I just said, “Curtis,
it ’s your turn.’ He just
went out and stuck the
kid. The heat was on,
that ’s for sure. He went
out with ﬁre in his eyes,
and when he pinned the
kid, it just brought our
team back to life. ” i

— Rande Stottlemyer

“We are not really happy,” Pitt head
coach Rande Stottlemyer said after the
meet. “We are a little disappointed.”

Going into the match, Stottlemyer
thought there were several matches the
Panthers would have to prevail in.

Some cold thoughts on a cold winter
day: »

0 With the Pitt basketball team 13-6
overall and 4-4 in the Big East, one
wonders if Pitt head coach Roy Chip-
man’s job would be in jeopardy right
now had he not resigned on Dec. 18.

The Panthers have been inconsistent
all year but could easily be nationally
ranked. That makes one also wonder
if perhaps Chipman’s job was in
jeopardy when he resigned on Dec. 18.
It’s just a thought. Your guess is as
good as mine.

° Did anyone notice that members of

the Pitt basketball team sported ribbons
on their uniforms last game? It was a
protest against the university's ties «with
South Africa. ~

As I look into my crystal ball, I

foresee a strange turn of events com-
ing in the next few months:

‘March 1 — The Panthers win their
ninth straight game, -embarrassing
Georgetown at the Capital Center
94-53. Chipman receives word that the
Panthers are seeded third in the upcom-
ing Big East Tournament.

March 5 — At the Big East awards
banquet the day before the Panthers‘
begin competition, it is a strong Pitt
showing. Chipman receives Coach of
the Year, Charlesgsmith gets Player of
the Year, but Villanova freshman Doug
West edges out Jerome Lane for

Things did not work out as planned.

“We thought that 134, 150 and 177
would all-be pivotal matches for us in
this meet,” Stottlemyer said. “We only
won one of those matches.”

The key match turned out to be at
190 where Conner, a junior from
Grove City, wasted no time getting the
Panthers sixteam points. He pinned
-Suvak only 41 seconds into the ﬁrst
period.

“I just said ‘Curtis, it’s your turn,’
” Stottlemyer said. “He just went out
and stuck ‘the kid. The heat was on,
that’s for sure. He went out with ﬁre
in his eyes, and when he pinned the
kid, it just brought our team back to
life.”

Cleveland State was one point away
from winning the match. Had Sipos,

-only a freshman, lost by one more

point, Backhcuh’s victory would have
been a superior decision and the Pan-

‘ thers would have suffered their first

defeat of the season. Such was not the
case.

“Sipos had to suck it up just not to
give up that extra point,” Stottlemyer
said. “If he gives up one more point,
we lose 21-20.”

Pitt’s record goes to 5-0-2 while
Cleveland State’s improved to 5-2-1.
Pitt’s next match is a tri-match Feb. 1,
at Navy with William and,Mary.

Freshman of the Year. West shows up
at the banquet driving a Maserati with
a license plate, that reads: “GO
WE$T.”

The Big East tries to have all the ex-
penses of the banquet billed to its of-
fice in Rhode Island, but West insists
that he will pick up the tab. He does,
charging it to an American Express ac-
count under the name of a Villanova
alumnus. “The American Express
Card,” says West, “don’t leave home
without it." ’

March 8 — In the Big East ﬁnal, Pitt
knocks off Syracuse for the second time
this year, 76-75 in overtime. Curtis
Aiken sticks a jumper at the end of
regulation to send the game into over-
time, then scores all eight Panther
points in the extra period. Dwayne
Washington is on the foul line with
0:01 on the clock, shooting a one-and-
one. He chokes, and the Panthers head
to the NCAA Tournament.

March 10 — Pitt receives a bid to
the NCAA tournament, but the Pan-
thers are seeded fourth in Western
Regional. “No respect,” mumbles a
disgruntled Chipman.

March 12 — The day before the
Panthers head west to begin practice,
their first video is released. It is titled
'.‘The Pitt Hoop Shuffle.” It goes
something like this: U

My name is Curtis, and I own this
place, -

When I shoot the ball, it ’s in your
face. '

Pitt’s Johnny Hnath scored an 8-3 decision last night in Cleveland.

What if Chipman had not resigned

Demetreus, too, he shoots pretty ﬁne,

Except, of course, when the game ’s
on the line. .

And then there is Charles, he can
play,

He belongs in the NBA.

We're not here looking for trouble,-

We just wanna do The Pitt Hoop
Shuﬁle.

March 19 — The Panthers continue
on their tear, defeating Kansas in the
Western Regional ﬁnal 67-65. Charles
Smith scores 28 points and grabs 17 re-

Jim Urban

bounds, while holding Kansas’ Danny
Manning to eight points and three re-
bounds. The Final Four begins in three
days. ,
March 20 — The NCAA blunders.
All four teams (Pitt, North Carolina,
Georgia Tech and Michigan) arrive in
Dallas, only to discover that Twisted
Sister has its stage set up for a week
of concerts. While lawyers represent-
ing both parties argue over who gets
the arena, members of the other three
teams show interest in Pitt’s anti-
apartheid ribbons. It is announced that
all four teams will wear the ribbons
when and if the Final Four is played.
“I wanna rock,” proclaims Twisted
Sister’s Dee Snider, and that he does.

The NCAA is shown to the door and-

must now ﬁnd another place to play the

Sports  

Pitt wrestlers remain unbeaten      

Final Four.

“The Pitt Hoop Shufﬂe” moves to
No. 5 on the MTV TOD-20 Count-
down.

March 21 — The NCAA’s search
for a place to play the Final Four con-
cludes. There is only one available spot
—— Sun City, South Africa.

March 22 — FFPAA (Final Four
Participants Against Apartheid) comes
out with a video. Originally titled “Sun
City,” it states simply that they ain’t
gonna play Sun City. The Final Four
is canceled, but Pitt ﬁnishes ranked No.
1 in three different polls: AP, UPI and
the MTV Top-20 Video Poll.

0 Do not get me wrong. By no means
am I trying to make fun of Pitt’s anti-
apartheid ribbons. I was surprised it
took them this long to show some type
of protest. Keep them as part of the
uniform.

0 Did anyone notice that Chipman
never draws a technical foul? Several
Pitt players complained about St.
John’s Walter Berry getting away with
a little too much during last Saturday’s
game at the field house. Chipman
threw his jacket once, but still no
technical fouls. -

0 Whoever said that there is safety in
numbers? You’re wrong. Last Satur-

. day it was Ron Rowan and Walter

Berry against Curtis Aiken, Demetreus
Gore, Charles Smith and Keith Arm-
strong. I do not have to say'who won.

0 Jumping back to the point that Chip-
man never draws any technical fouls —

 

maybe if he did, he would be able to
protect Charles Smith a little better.
Smith seems to get called for fouls at
home that Walter Berry doesn’t get
called for on the road. '

0 Whatever happened to Tiger Paul?
Word has it that he is currently work-
ing in a casino in Las Vegas. I say we
legalize gambling in Pennsylvania,
build a casino, give him a job and let
him lead the cheers once again a? the

‘ ﬁeld house. '

0 Speaking of Las Vegas, that is
where fonner Pitt basketball coach Tim
Grgurich is. Grgurich is currently, an
assistant coach to Jerry Tarkanian at
N evada-Las Vegas. He has become one
of the most respected assistant coaches
in the nation. Why not give him a shot
at the Pitt coaching job? '

0 Another good candidate would be

Allegheny Community College head -
coach Bill Shay. He gets kids out of the ‘

city, teaches them the importance of

academics and never has a losing

season. He can coach.

Pitt has already been blessed with
one of Shay’s products,‘ Tico Cooper.
Cooper may not be making a large im-
pact on the program, but when Cooper
came out of high school, no one ex-
pected him to go anywhere.

(Editor 's note: The above listed predic-
tions were in fun only and by no means
were meant to harm the reputation of
Doug West,‘ the NCAA or Villanova
University.)

Kristy Pieters won the all-around to
pace the Lady Panther gymnasts to a

, 174.70-173.45 win over New Hamp-
shire Saturday at Trees Hall. The meet ’

was much closer than the score in-
dicated, however, and head coach Don-
na Sanft was not entirely happy with
the win.

“We weren’t as sharp as two weeks
ago. Beam and ﬂoor were disappoint-
ing,” Sanft said. Pitt suffered four falls
in their last three beam routines. Pieters
was Pitt’s highest ﬁnisher, in third
place, with an 8.90. Freshman
Stephanie Megill and sophomore Bren-
da Frischmann also perfomied solid-
ly. Frischmann, nicknamed “The
Beam Queen,” was entered into the
lineup after Alisa Spector was
withdrawn from the competition.

“Alisa’s shoulder has been bother-
ing her so we took her out halfway
through the meet,” assistant coach

Louie Liguori said. “Brenda and Cathy .

Coleman [on ﬂoor exercise] went up
on short notice. It was a tough situa-
tion, and they really came through.
They weren’t ﬂustered. ” -

Floor'exercise was the only event Pitt
lost in the meet. New Hampshire’s Pat-
ty Converse and Michelle Sawyer took
the top two places. Pieters and Pitt‘s
Trish Aser tied for third with 8.90.
Pieters’ routine was one of the more
difficult floor exercises shown
Saturday.

This past Saturday, the men and

Boston to attend the Boston Universi-

did quite well. They had some good
performances on the relay teams, and
true to form, Lee McRae set another
record.

dynamic, well-choreographed routine
out of the top scores. Waters was
visibly nervous before her routine but
Liguori said, “ She’s been ready to do
it all week. This was the ﬁrst time Beth
has competed a double back this year.
We wanted her to -try it this week and
get the first one over with.”

A sore knee resulting from the open-
ing fall makes Waters, along with
Spector, questionable for this week’s
Cat Classic at Missouri. .

If Waters provided the audience with
the biggest gasp of. the meet in her ﬂoor

exercise, she also provided‘ the high-
light. Strong giant svslings and a high
toe-on front somersault dismount
scored a 9.55 on bars, for the highest
score of the evening and ﬁrst place.
Pieters scored a 9.00 to ﬁnish third.

Sanft said that the bars event was bet-
ter for the entire team because ‘ ‘we’ve
been concentrating on bars since the
Temple meet.”

The other Pitt highlight was Kristy
Pieters’ all-around performance. She
was easily the most consistent gymnast
in the meet. She scored 9.00, 8.90,
8.90 to finish third on bars, beam and

leads Pitt’s trac

with a 6.22, and set a new field house
record, while in the 55-meter hurdles

team also had another outstanding day.
Both the 4 X400 and the 4 X800 relay
teams qualified for the the IC4As. The
mile relay of Jesse Mikell, Dave
Moore, Dorrell Hilliman and Alan
Laws won .the meet with a time of
3: 13.5, and the two-mile relay team of
Rodney Giles, Pete Hurley, Thomas

Coach John Vasvary was very
pleased with the way his team per-
formed at the meet. It was the first
chance for them to see a good deal of
the competition they will be having in
the conference championships this
season, and it was one they did not

Lady Panthers
at Georgetown

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Tonight the Lady Panthers travel
to Washington, D.C. to take on the
Georgetown Hoyas at McDonough
Gym in an 8:15 p.m. Big East con-
ference game. The Lady Panthers
are coming off a disastrous 96-71
loss to Providence last Saturday.
The loss dropped Pitt to 7-9 overall
and 3-6 in the Big East.

Georgetown will be seeking
revenge for a 65-55 Jan. 2 loss to
Pitt at Fitzgerald Field House. Kim
Gannis and Jenny Tyner led the
way for the Lady Panthers in that
game, scoring 19 and 14 points,
respectively. The Hoyas were 5-13
overall and 1-7 in the league going
into last Saturday’s road game at
Connecticut. Junior Ann Gothard is
the only player the Hoyas have in
the Big East Top 10 in scoring and
rebounding.

Pitt was scheduled to play an
away game at Duquesne Monday
night but the game was canceled.
Head coach Kirk Bruce explained
why: “One of their players was in
the hospital and they had only four
healthy girls. In fact, they started
the season with only nine players.”

Pitt has no plans to reschedule the
game. “Our schedule is filled the
rest of the season, so I don’t see
when we could do it,” said Bruce.

help in the ﬁeld events,” said Vasvary.
In addition to the fine performance
put on by the men, the women also

. sparkled in the invitational. They set

several ‘school records, and had several
people in among the top finishers.
The 4x400-meter relay of Pat
Cupid, Renee Henderson, Sue Torrey
and Gloria Azeke set a school record
with a time of 3250.1. Also there were
a number of great individual perfor-
mances. In the 500-meter dash, Sue
Torrey placed second and her time of
1:16.1 set a new school record. In the
1,000-meter run, Amy Difrancescoi

placed second in 2256.5, in the
55-meter dash Renee Henderson placed
third with a time of 7. 18 seconds, and
in the 800-meter run Gloria Azeke
placed fourth in a time of 2: 13. 1, which
was also a schoolrecord.

“The mile relay was out of sight,”
Coach Steve Lewis exclaimed of his
runners. “The mile relay — Sue, Amy,
Renee and Gloria — all were great.

“We are really coming along. There
was some good competition there and
we had some great performances from
all of the athletes.”

antoro boosts Pitt Wrestl

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh wres-
tling team received a major boost when
Bethlehem’s Pat Santoro decided to at-
tend Pitt in May of 1985. Santoro
joined the Panthers with high creden-
tials from Bethlehem Catholic High
School. He compiled a 104-17-1 career
record, capping off his senior season
at 39-2 and a third place finish at the
1984 PIAA Championships.

Before taking his talents to Pitts-
burgh, Santoro stopped off at Blair
Academy in New Jersey. While at-
tending the prep school, he went
undefeated with 26 victories, finishing
the year as the National Prep Cham-
pion and the tournament’s outstanding
wrestler.

From there, the next obvious move
should have been the Lehigh Univer-
sity wrestling room, but that wasn’t the
case. Most everybody assumed young
Patrick would follow in the footsteps
of his father Richard, a two-time
Eastern champion, and brother Rich,
also a two-time Eastern champion and
a much heralded three-time All-
America at Lehigh. Instead, Pat opted
for a chance to makehis own name at
Pitt.

“When I came fora visit to Pitt, I
liked the campus, the team and the
coach,” remembers Santoro. “I’m in-
terested in physical therapy and school
was the first priority in my decision.
As for wrestling, I decided to leave
home, because the Pitt wrestling team
is on the rise.”

Now a member of the Pitt wrestling
team, Santoro is still having great suc-
cess as the starting 142—pounder. His
current record is 20-4, the team’s
second-best record. In tournament
competition so far, he has won the
prestigious Penn State Invitational and
placed third at the Mat Town USA
tournament at Lock Haven.

He has been instrumental in helping
the Panthers to a 5-0-2 overall record,
a 19th place ranking in the Amateur
Wrestling News, and a No. 20 ranking
in National Mat News. Additionally,
the Panthers are undefeated in the
Eastern Wrestling League with a mark
of 2-0-1.,

Panther head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer holds high regard for his prize
freshman.

“He certainly doesn’t wrestle like a
freshman,” said Stottlemyer. “He has

i an intense desire to win. He is doing

as well as any freshman I’ve been
around as both a wrestler and a coach.
This kid gets ticked off when he gives
up points, even when he wins.”

On Jan. 9, Santoro had a chance to
show Lehigh what it lost when he opted
to leave his home town". Santoro and
his Panther teammates held on to draw
even with the ninth-ranked Engineers,
21-21, after building a 21-9 lead.

Santoro more than held his own
against Pete Yozzo, the No. 3-rated
142-pounder in the nation. The two
battled back and forth with Santoro
leading four different times in the
match. Yozzo was able to escape the
near upset, narrowly edging Santoro
8-7.

Among those-present were Santoro’s
proud parents, Richard and Mary San-
toro.iThey watched their son with great
pride as he gave his all in a valiant ef-
fort against his father’s alma mater.

“We felt good about it,” said the
elder Santoro. “We wanted to see our
son win. It felt funny at times pulling
for him and the team. when sometimes
I found myself naturally wanting
Lehigh to win. I know Pat wanted it
in the worst way and he was definitely
a little nervous.”

The younger Santoro was somewhat ‘

disappointed. “I really wanted that
match, but I was happy the way I
wrestled. Yozzo is probably the best
wrestler I ever wrestled."

Santoro’s peer, Peter Yozzo, had his
own impressions of Pitt’s freshman
sensation: “Pat is really tough. He cer-
tainly has improved greatly, but as
always. he never stops coming at you. "

Even his teammates have taken
notice of Santoro‘s presence. both on
the mat and in the wrestling room.
“He's a real spark to thisteam,” said

senior Eric Wertz. “He makes us older
guys work even harder when we see
how hard he does.”

“He’s sure to be an All—America,”
said co-captain Kyle Nellis. “If not this
year, then before he graduates.”

Coach Stottlemyer remarked, “Pat’s
really earned a special place in their
[teammates] hearts. They respect him
partly from the wrestling mat and in
practice.”

As for his teammates, Santoro also
holds them in high regard. “Everyone
is strong and supportive of one another.
I, too, look up to the other guys.
They’re a big inspiration to me.”

As for the remainder of the season,
there is still a long way to go. For the
conﬁdent Santoro, the season has just
begun to warm up. In the latest
Amateur Wrestling News rankings,
Santoro has moved his way up to the
15th position at 142 pounds.

“My goal this season is first an EWL
title, and then to make a trip to na-
tionals,” said Santoro. “Rankings real-
ly don’t matter until the end of the year.
It’s what you do at tournament time that
counts and not the rankings.”

Somehindsight from Pitt-St. J ohn’s

The ball sailed hopelessly through
the air as a sigh of relief came from the
victorious St. John's coach Lou
Carnesecca. The shot. a panicky off-
balance heave by Deiiietreus Gore with
seven seconds on the clock. landed fit-
tingly into the awaiting arms of
Redmen Walter Berry. Good night.
Panthers. There‘s always a
Westminster or a St. Francis to beat up
on when you need an impressive win.

Gore's airball was quite an ap-
propriate ending to Pitt's 68-67 loss in
the Field House Saturday afternoon.
After shooting a blistering 76 percent
in the ﬁrst half. Coach Roy Chipman‘s
Panthers went into the locker room
leading by an impressive 12 points.
40-28. ’

Everything wasjust fine and dandy.
Pitt was dominating in every aspect of
the game. holding the spectacular
Berry. who eventually scored half of
St. John's points. to 12. Curtis Aiken
was incendiary from the perimeter.
center Charles Smith hit ﬁve of his first
seven attempts. the swarming Panther
defense forced six St. John's turnovers.
and hey. even the threatless Joey David
hit a shot. Things were really cooking.

Then the real 13-6 Panthers showed
up. Playing like the game was a wrap.
Pitt amiably tried their damndest to
give the sparse St. John’s faithful who
were present something to hoot and
holler about. Taking advantage of

Chipman‘s poorly-arranged 1-3-l
defense. with none other than Joey
David playing the crucial low position.
St. John's outscored the Panthers 27- 10
in a little under 10 minutes. Why David
was playing underneath, where he had
to contend with Berry and the high-
ﬁying Willie Glass. probably remains
a mystery to all who viewed the nation-
ally televised game. Let‘s face it -
Joey David can’t hang with the sky-

some Pitt running back. St. John’s,

Armstrong were tag—teaming, domi-
nated the boards and built a six-point
lead which they took into the ﬁnal eight

realized. on the wing. or maybe even
on the bench once in a while. David
practically played the entire game
against St. John's taking only a brief
30-second pause midway through the
first half.

But David wasn‘t the onlyfactor in
the Panthers‘ ..fourth Big East loss.
Chipman‘s senseless substitutionslended
quite a helping hand to the Redmen
cause. ‘At one point in the game,,with

Smith on the‘be_t_1ch with four fouls, -
both Tico Cooper and Keith Armstrong’ '

were onithe floor displaying their in-

play. Despite their lackluster second-
half performance, Pitt still had an
opportunity to salvage the ballgame.
Beaver Falls product Ron Rowan
made sure that they didn’t. The
deadeye guard nailed a 15-foot baseline
shot to give his team a two-point lead.
with 1:06 remaining. After a Rowan
foul sent Pitt forward Armstrong to the
free throw line, the Panthers had a

chance to tie the contest. But the placid

Armstrong cooly bricked the first of his
two bonuses, then swished the next,
setting the ﬁnal score.

Now comes the most questionable

part of the hoopfest. With 1 1 seconds
remaining. Keith Armstrong fouled
Rowan during the ‘St. John‘s freeze.
Rowan was definitely the wrong Red-
nian to send to the foul line. but the
sluggish Panthers were having such an
awful time with their opponents keep-
away tactics that they were ready to
tackle Carnesecca himself.

But what to the crowd’s wondering
eyes should appear: Ron Rowan had
missed: Pitt could win it right here.

No. sorry folks. This is Fitzgerald
Playground League. With fellas like
Curtis. me and Mr. Fluid. 11 seconds
is [7/(’llf_\‘ of time to get a quick hoop.
Roy‘s got a lot of confidence in his
Sultans of Slam.

guys? A 360—degree Chocolate
Thunder from Charlie would send the
crowd home buzzing. Or perhaps an
alley—oop from Aiken to Gore would
even make the cover of Sports 11-
lustrated. Nice. This ought to be fun.

"Surprise, surprise,” as Gomer Pyle
would say. If you didn’t catch the end
of this thriller, check out the first
paragraph of this obituary. .

Now the Panthers are the perfect ex-
ample of mediocrity in the Big East
(4-4). Their loss to St. John’s wasjust
another episode in the continuing saga
of “Pitt Blows the Big Game.” And
just think, freshman wizard Jerome

Lane didn’t have a thing to say about it.

Swimmers add another win

By Gary Geller
Staff. Writer

The Pitt women’s swim team
defeated West Virginia Universityover
the weekend decisively 85-54. Coach
David Belowich was happy with the
solid Panther performance and said,
“We had a very good meet. I’m
pleased with the way we acted and the
way we swam overall.” Pitt’s domi-
nance in swimming is illustrated by
their 19-0 record which spans two

’ years. In addition, the Panther’s slate

this year is a robust 10-0.

The meet began slowly for Pitt as
they lost the ﬁrst event, the 200-yard
medley, and were down 7-0. In the
1,000-yard freestyle, Chris Kaucher
took ﬁrst with a time of 10:42.87 and
Kathy Bates grabbed third place in
10:51.19. Marvelous freshman Tricia
Rickert ﬁnished the 200-yard freestyle
in 1:55.06 and in the process captured
first place. “Tricia had a very good
swim,” said Bilowich. “She’s show-
ing herself to be a classy swimmer.
We’re lucky to have her for three more

years.” Marian Cassidv ﬁnished sec-

" ond with a time of 1:57.09 and

Maureen Cleary, who normally swims
in the backstroke, took third with a
strong swim. . . .
Pitt also showed depth when two
freshmen, Lorraine Buibord and Gayle
Wyland, took second and third places
in the "100-yard backstroke. Jody
O’Neil, described by Belowich as

32.

“having a tremendous meet,” won the
100-yard breast stroke with a time of
1:08.16. Senior Wendy Morgan took
third in that event in 1:12.72. —

The next event, the 200-yard butter-
ﬂy, was won by WVU’s Ruth Horn
while Pitt’s Judy Haughton came in a
close second with a time of 2:09.06.
After that event, Pitt held a slim lead,
27-25. ‘ E

Pitt took ﬁrst and second in the next
two events as the Panthers began to pull
away from WVU. Sue Hickman took
both the 50- and 100—yard freestyle
races with times of 24.23 and 52.61
respectively. Belowich said, “Her per-
formances have become extremely
positive, and she has become an artist
in the water.”

In the diving events, Pitt was
unbeatable. Pitt diving coach Julian
Krug has tutored his divers to perfec-
tion. Jennifer Brown captured two pool
records in the one—meter and three-
meter diving events with scores of
265.95 and 279.46.

In addition, Pitt had a freshman and
two sophomores qualify for the NCAA
prequalifying meet. Belowich de-
scribed the accomplishment by saying,
“All of the elite divers in the East will
be at that meet.”

Belowich said he thinks that Pitt will
be hard to defeat this season. “I don’t
think at this point we can be stopped,”
he said. “We’re moving on to an even
higher level of performance that is
way, way up. Right now, we have a
pure competition that is bordering on
the ideal.”
