Parking
Authority
to resume

a ticketing

Gwenn Barney
For The Pitt News

As the snow melts, so do hopes for an-
other day of free parking. Today, the
Pittsburgh ParkingAuthoritywillonce
again begin ticketing people Whose
parking meters run out. '

On Feb. 8, just days after the storm
nowknownassnowpocalypse, Parking
Authority officials armouncedthatthey
wouldn’tticketpeople until road condi-
tions improved and parkingmetershad
been cleared of snow.

Parking Authorityworkers also.

_ had to ﬁx some of the malﬁinctioning
‘ meters. 1 -

Since then, Pitisburghers have been
able to park at Parking Authority me-

ters and in their lots for free. Tickets

usually rangefrom $11 to $16.
“We’ll have to get back in our rou-
tine,” David Onorato, executivedirector

of the ParkingAuthority,_ said. “A lot of .

the parkinghas reuirnedto normal, if
not 100 percent.”

Onorato eslimatedthatthe Parking
Authority lost about $200,000 in the
two weeks it did not issue tickets. He,
said the ParkingAuthon'ty didn’tt:icket
because it wouldn’t be fair to charge
people who couldn’t get to their me-
ters. y

Parking Authority workers have
spent much ofthelasttwo weeks clear-
ingsnow of company property. Yestera
day, these staff members returned to
their normal routine and distributed

, warnings to those who did not pay for ~

parking.

Counseling Centeroffers advice for coping  

Erin. Block
Staﬁ’ Writer

The news of the Pit student Alexa Marie Eplett’s
death grieved the community and brought the
issue of depression to the foreground.

James Cox, director of Pitt’s Counseling
Center, responded quickly to the news.

“We don’t wait. We go and seek [those in
need of help] out,” he said.

The Counseling Center hosted three
workshops atLothrop Hallinthe daysfollowing
herdeath, Cox said. Counselors were placed in
the residence hall the day of the incident and

remained at the students’ disposal ever since,
at the rﬁuest of the resident assistant.

The centercpntacted Eplett’s family and -

friendsas onas itsworkers found out about her
death, ox said. The center provides individual
services for Pitt students. ' '

‘All we can do is learn how to prevent this
from happening again,” Cox said. “We have to
be aware.” ’

Howto cope ,

Stay connected to friends and family. Many
people ﬁnd it helpﬁil to talk with others about
what happened, but eventhosewho prefer not to

   

talk can ﬁnd comfort in being with loved ones.

Take care of yourself Eat well, get enough
exercise and sleep. Do activities you enjoy or
ﬁnd relaxing.

Don’t make big life—changing decisions for
several months.

Take time to grieve. Traumatic events often
leave us with a sense of loss.

Do something positive to help others. For
example, give blood, donate food or volunteer.

 Privacy for privacy’s

sake an uneducated
mistake a

he Obama administration

I has started to ‘push forth

a new education agenda.

At the center of this effort is in-
creasing accountability in higher

education by a keener use oﬁstu-

, dent data. ‘

The uncertainty in the interpre-

tation of the Fami1y.‘Educatio_na1 .

Rights and Privacy Act makes this
an issue of intense debate, but
there is some merit here;

This act bans colleges from re-
leasing student data without the
student’s consent and provides

students‘ with data about educa— ‘

tional institutions with U.S. De-
partment of Education funding.

The system President Barack ..

Obama.-proposes already uses the

mechanics of how colleges store.

and disclose student data. 4
States can already develop and

use databases of student records. ‘

The new angle Obama brings is
for collaboration within states and

- between them and the federal gov-

ernment.

Obama proposes that states
exercise these abilities so that a
common-standards effort could be
more approachable. In essence, in-
stitutions would have to report to a
single bodyin the country, increas-
ing accountability and scope. ‘

In principle, this raises thoughts

« of big government. Should it‘?

The purpose is to improve
American education. The country
needs to make an initial assess-

— ment of its present condition, so

it can" prescribe more succinct
solutions. ‘ '

If students already give their
records to the state, then privacy
seems to become an irrelevant ar-
gument against this national effort.
There doesn’t "seem to be a differ-
ence in one entity having access to
it, or the other, larger one.

More importantly, this nation-
wide system would still protect in-

dividuals from being pinpointed. .

Individual data would not be re‘-

leased.
The real meat of these statis-
tics lies in information about the

groups of students, regions,ofstu- - »
dents or studentsgin a particular ‘
.ﬁeld or institution.

But Social Security numbers
would be used at some levels —— at

least in secured E‘2II!P‘.1I9F;$}l5£.¢F..!1$z...,.. .

Jane Oates, an assistant secretary
of labor who used to work for for-

, mer Sen. Ted Kennedy, said.

Colleges already use a common

. ‘nationwide database storing these
numbers to track ﬁnancial aid eli-

gibility.

The legislature and network are
already in place for student data
collection and assessment at.the
state level. _ ’

Giving non-individual access to
the federal government at the na-
tional level lendsitself to smarter
legislation. p

Because the state can already
collect ‘student data, it does not
mean much tothe individual if the
greater government uses it for the
betterment of education.

..But it can impact private

schools.

These schools usually control
the data they release themselves,
so they have a control of their own

image, statistics-wise. They m_ight_

not want to lose that control.‘ .

In 2008, backed by lobbyists
from private colleges, Congress
barred any such system at the na-
tional level.

With Congress’ lack of prog-
ress lately, Obama would have
another layer of difﬁculty to push
this agenda.

It is important to understand .

the motives behind legislature
before attaching to it a certain
sentiment. This plan is simply to
improve education. . 2f .7

If Washington could treat this

‘ issue more comprehensively than

our individualized units, then it
mightipbe worthy of consider-
ation.

Gun legislation misfires

Caitlyn Christensen
’ Columnist

Last week, the Senate in my home
state ofvirginia passed a slew of bills
aimed at scaling back the state’s gun
laws. The first repeals a one-gun—a-
month cap on arms buyers. The
second allows those with concealed-
carry permits to take their hidden
weapons into restaurants and bars
that serve alcohol. The Senate also
passed abill allowing guns to be kept
in locked glove compartments with-

. outapermit. ‘

Even though the laws were insti-
tuted in Virginia, other states should

' take heed. Even in Pennsylvania, the

laws for carryingaconcealedweapon

-are relatively lax. The Pennsylvania

Firearm Owners Association’s web-

site says that while concealed carry ‘

permits are not granted to minors,
convicted felons or domestic abusers,

itis“verysirnplefort1‘ustworthy, law— «'

abiding people to obtain one quickly

The Association’s wordingis naive,

plain-and simple. In 2006, Charles
CarlRoberts Nmurdered ﬁve Arnis_h
students in Lancaster County before
turning the gun on himself. Although
seemingly a sick individual, Roberts
had no record of mental instability. It
is unreasonable to assume or expect
that everyone interested in cartyinga
concealed weaponwill continue to be
a “trustworthy, law—abiding” person
after the purchase ofhis handgim. The
Virginia bills passed in a Democrat-
controlled state Senate possibly as
part of a backlash against the cur-
rent presidential administration.
The reasoning behind the bills reeks
of the kind of paranoia and Second
Amendment arrogance that could
spread nationally. I
. Republican delegate Bob Mar-
shall ‘said that the repeal of the limit
on arms buying is legitimate because,
“We shouldn’t get rid of our Second
Amendment rights because some
people in New York City decide to
abuse theirs.”
Guns don’t only go off in New
York. Marshall has clearly forgotten

that Virginia’s recent history is riddled A

with gun-related tragedies. During my

. senior year of high school, I had to

waitto hearwhetl1er any of myformer
high school classmates were killed in
the Virginia Tech shooting spree, the
deadliest peacetime shooting incident
byasingle gunman in U.S. history. As
well,John Allen Muhammad and Lee
Boyd Malvo shot 13' people inthe D.C.
area in2oo2. I still rememberfeeling
my heart in my throat every time a
white box van drove past.
Republican Senator Emmett '

‘ Hanger said he supported the mea-

sure to allow concealed weapons into
bars and restaurants because it meant
that law-abiding gun carriers could
ﬁnally enjoy their favorite restaurants,
“such as Red Lobster,” with the secu-
rity of a ﬁrearm by their side.

Who is coming after us during
Lobsterfest? The shrimp scampi?

Hanger also added that he knew
“plenty of women” who already car-
ried handguns intheir purses. Ifthese
people are already carrying concealed
weapons into restaurants, they clearly
aren’t law-abiding citizens. Hanger’s
implication that the law’s purpose is to

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

World should control reaction to Niger coup  

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

   
 

Perhaps the clearest division between
the United States and most of the rest
of the world is how the civilian gov-
ernment relates to the military.

Our tradition is that through the
court of public opinion, civilians
have a healthy inﬂuence over the
military’s decisions. Congress has
some oversight on what the com-
mander in chief does, and the voters
can certainly punish those who do
things they don’t like.

A lot of the world doesn’t work
this way. In nations such as Turkey
and Thailand, the army considers
itselfafourthbranch of government
and often gets involved in political
questions. Military coups have been a
part of history for ages, and inthe last
several years, we’ve seen successful
coups in Thailand, Fiji, Mauretania,
Honduras and just last Thursday, in
the West African nation of Niger.

The Niger coup was the usual af-
fair of a bunch of men with guns seiz-
ing the presidential palace and with
it, the president himself, Mamadou
Tandja. Tandja was taken to an undis-
closed location — no doubt the same
one Dick Cheney used to frequent.
The Wall Sneetjournal reported that

the “coupsters” assure he is safe and
sound. Don’t worry, trust us.

The African Union has con-
demned the coup, as has France,
Niger’s former colonial power. The
European Union has followed suit,
and South Africa’s president Jacob
Zuma said this wasn’t' good for the
prospects of democracy in Africa
in general. More immediately, Ni-

_ ger is a major supplier of uranium, V at

which means vexation for Europe,
especially France, which, according
to PBS, generates 76 percent of its
electricity from nuclear power.
With so many people roundly
condemning this coup as an exer-
cise in anti-democratic behavior, it
is easy to assume this was the case.
. After all, any coup in Europe or the

United States would run -against ev- _.
ery democratic tradition we hold a

sacred. However, in Niger, the en-

tire story is more complicated, and.
the world shouldn’t rush to any ﬁrm

conclusions.

Mamadou Tandja wasn’t a cute,
cuddly and fully democratic gentle-
man to begin with.

According to the BBC, Tandjawas
recently concentrating more powerin
his own hands. He rammed through
a possibly bogus referendum that
eliminated presidential term limits

February 23, 2010 I The Pitt N evvs Cl WWw.pittneWs.com

and dissolved the nation’s parliament

and supreme court. _A former 'presi- ‘

dent of the Economic Community
of West Africa, Dr. Mohamed Ibn
Chambas, also tattletaled on Niger,
telling the EU that this guywas about
as democratic as King George III. The
Canadian Press added that Tandja
had postponed elections, giving him-
selfa three-year extension of illegiti-
mate power. The press in Niger was
regulated, and it looked like Niger
was headed forrule by “Tandja the
Tinpot” in short order.

While the intemational commu-A
nitywrings its hands over whatabad _
‘example this sets for the rest of Af-
rica, inNiamey, Niger‘, the party’s on.‘ ’

Thousands have taken to the streets
to celebrate the coup, and many in

the opposition parties cheerednews \

of the coup. Of course, they sent notes
to the junta — the military govem-
ment —' urging them to restore de-
mocracy as soon as possible.
Granted, this rriight not be ex-
actly free and fair enthusiasm on
the streets. After all,—if you’ve got
guys driving around on trucks with
anti—aircrafc guns mounted on them,
are you going to actively and loudly
disagree with them? However, un-
less the army is actually dragging
people out of their houses — and

there doesn’t seem to be any indica-
tion of that — folks are coming out
in favor of the coupon theirown:
They could just stay home. Simply
put, at least some of the common
folk of Niger think this coup wasn’t
a bad idea. ’

In short, despite how bad coups
generally look, this coup looks better
than many others. For all the inter-
national outrage at how unconsti-

tutional, how very, very unconstitu— .
V tional this all was, we must keep in

mind that the deposed president was
himself not ruling according to the
constitution. From earlyindications,
it appears_that this co.up;_suc_cessfully

[removed an autocrat,-_and:_the junta

has at least made prornises of restor-
ing democracy. ‘ Z ‘

-And Whatgare. the odds _of.resto- .. .

ration of that democracy? After all, "
very few juntas come right out and
say, “Yep, we want to rulethis nation
withan iron ﬁst. Any questions?”Jun—
tas also have the unfortunate habit of
permanently declaring temporary
states of emergency. Elections that
occur under juntas also tend to favor
the party that electioneers by having

guys drive around with anti—aircrait -~

guns. Many of these elections also
lend new meaning to the idea of “a -
tack ads.” And you thought campaign

ﬁnance was a problem. '

However, there are some indica- -

tions that this coup might not lead
to extended military rule.’ Accord-

ing to The Wall Street Journal, the

president of Senegal has begun me-

diating in Niger, and he is conﬁdent i

that civilian rule will be restored in
short order. He’s meeting with all of
Niger’s major political parties, and“
a new constitution will probably be
hammered out shortly. Mamoudou
Gazibo, an assistant professor of

political science at the University ~

of Montreal-_quoted in the Journal,
notes that some of the participants
in this coup also participated in the
coup of 1999, which ended. in the
elections that Tandja won. Gazibo
sees no reason these oﬁicers would
suddenlyturn. less democratic this
time around.‘

This is not to say that the interria—
tional community should not scruti-
nize the Niger junta. If the junta hangs

on to powerforanextended period of V

time and makes no effort to restore

democracy, then it will be time for

condemnation. For the time being,
however, the world should await de-
velopments and realize that all coups
are not created equal.

Most great bands come with a
name that reﬂects its members.

The Doors was named after the
German Bauhaus art movement.
Black Sabbath was named after a
1963 horror ﬁlm. Supersuckers,
however, was named after some
“quality adult literature,” accord-
ing to lead singer Eddie Spaghetti,
born Edward Carlyle Daly III.

A name can say a lot about a
band, or it can say nothing at all,
which Spaghetti found out the hard
way.

so-serious. We don’ttak_e rock that
seriously, but I mean our name is
the Supersuckers. We brought
that sh*t on ourselves,” Spaghetti
said. . .
“Our stupidity works for us. It
helps us to not see how futile and
senseless this wholeendeavor can
be,” he said. _
The real relief is not only that
they’re still enjoying themselves,
but that the self-proclaimed “great-
.est rock ’n’ roll band in the world”
will melt your face off tonight at
the Altar Bar. The doors open at 7

“We come across as being not-

p.m., and the Show starts at 8.
The four—person band, which

V has been together for over 22

years, started out in Tucson, Ariz.,
playing garage punk not because
the band members were good at
it, but because they “liked to hang
out together.”

After their ﬁrst year together,
they threw on their leather jackets
and moved to Seattle, Wash. Short-
ly after, Eddie Spaghetti took over
the role of lead vocals when lead

« singer —and former ﬁfth member

— Eric Martin left the band.

“I think we found [our sound]
right away. We just stumbled upon
it when we were drinking heavily
and young and dumb,” he said.

In 1995, with seven years and
two albums under their large—buck-
led belts, guitarist Ron Heathman
brieﬂy departed from the group,
sparking its so—callecl_ “legacy of
confusion.” Upon his return, Su-
persuckers once again ignited its
devilishly aggressive rockabilly
style, which you might enjoy even
more if, in the words of Spaghetti,
“you feel stupid” when listening.
The band went on to produce 15
more celebrated albums.

“Everything has changed,” Spa-
ghetti said. “We still enjoy hanging
out, but it’s not the same group of
guys it used to be.” E

In October, history repeated it-
self, and Heathman left once again.
This time, it was for good.

“We’re still going to run the

legacy of confusion without him.

There is no getting around that,’

but We’re hopeful that people will
understand what we’ve been going
through, will be supportive and
will give us a break,” he said.

A You don’t hear abandoned un-
certainty streaming through the
speakers this time around, though.
What you hear is Marty Chandler
— the new addition to Supersuck-
ers’ ongoing rock party.

“[Marty]’s already brought a
lot to the table. He’s brought a new
theory to the band and energized
our live show quite a bit. It’s a shot

Supersuckers members’ faces aren’

in the arm to have him for sure,”

Spaghetti said.
A new guitarist isn’t the only
change the band is dealing with.

9 After recently putting what
Spaghetti calls Supersuckers’ in-
dependent “do-it-yourself—crap”
label — Mid-Fi Records — on
pause, the band once again has to
deal with “the middleman.”

“We’re hoping we don’t make
the same mistakes we made in the
past in that regard. We’re being
very careful with our selection,”
he said.

After 22 years of learning from

 

mistakes, Supersuckers still exists,
which is more than one can say for
many other bands.

If you want to improve your
odds of running into the band
members at tonight’s concert, ei-

ther head to the T—shirt table after

the show or try your luck at Prim-
anti Brothers.

“The good sandwich places
like that speak volumes for your
city,- and it’s open 24 hours -- that
doesn’t hurt its cause,” Spaghetti
said. “You know when you travel as
much as we do, it’s the little things
like that you look for.”

What to Say

Vanguard Records

Rocks like: Sara Bareilles, Brett
Dennen. .

B

There are albums that change your life, I

and there are albums that brighten your
day. Daphne Willis’ debut record, What to
Say, is of the latter variety.. _

After an employee at Vanguard Records
heard Willis’ songs on the in-flight music
channel of an airplane and took interest,
the smoky-voiced 22-year-old dropped out
‘of college to pursue her musical career full
time. The result is What to Say, a pleas-

ant, good-natured and largely forgettable ’

February 23, 2010 I The Pitt News I www.pittnews.com '

Artist knows ‘what

  tosay,’ not astound

Daphne Willis’ new album What to Say a mellow assortment

debut.

Coasting through its 12 songs, the al-
bum never ventures far from midtempo,
mellow ruminations on everyday life.
Accordingly, her lyrics are straightfor-
ward and conversational to the extreme

(two songs in a row begin with the word ‘

‘‘well’’), and many lines border on inane.
In the road-tripping “Far Away,” Willis
asks, “Should I stop? Or, do they take Visa?
That would be fantastic, cause plastic can
rhyme when you don’t have the time to
get cash.” - I‘

’ The music fares better than Willis’ often
wandering words — punches of acoustic’

‘ guitar_and horns ensure‘ that, if nothing

else, What to Say will lift your spirits dur-
ing its short 40-minute run.

What to Say is far from the cutting edge
of the music spectrum, but Willis’ voice
never hits a sore note._ Expect nothing
more and nothing less than mellowness.

No amount of gestation, however, would
make this feeble attempt at rebranding any
smoother.
As soon asthe guitar begins to blare on
opening track “American Star,” listeners

realize this is not the Lil Wayne they used
to know and love. The beats are medio-
cre and repetitive, and tracks sometimes
sound like they were recorded under wa-

but his version of singing is merely using-
Auto-Tune to produce enough warbles and
scoops to make Susan Boyle jealous.
“Paradice” is an especially embarrass-
ing rap—ballad, and first single “Prom
Queen” (released early last year),is a mess
of terrible lyrics: “I loved her fan'cy under-
wear / I’d sit behind her every year” i'— and

. one of the worst excuses for a chorus I have

heard in recent memory.
Not even the guest appearances on the

phones in averse on “Drop the World,”
and the consistently annoying Nicki Minaj
lends her lack of talent to the most radio-
friendly song on the album, “Knockout.”
Somehow, “Ground Zero” is the one track
that manages to combine the rock star aue
dio aesthetic with Wayne’s rapping ability
to some degree of success. Still, it is a far
cry from the artist’s best work.

Stick to rapping, Lil Wayne — your
ability to bust a rhyme is “A Milli” times
better than anything on this album.

Green Google: Company to deal in alernatives  

Donald Campbell

A recent article from CNE'I‘, “Google

peared in its website’s “Green Tech”
section.

So what are Google’s new ideas for
green and renewable energy? Alter

vices — most notably Gmail and its
popular searching capabilities —— by
asse_mbling large ntunbers of power-
hiingry servers. -

If Google is like the rest of us,
much of this power comes from coal
and other fossil fuels, giving Google a
rathersizable andproblematic carbon
footprint

Green and renewable energy sourc-
es, including solar, geothermal, wind
and hydroelectric power, account for
a comparatively small amount of the
power available to companies operat-
ing in the United States. An article on
Forbescomstates thatonlyaroundzto
3 percent of all the power generated in
the United States is generated without
the use of carbon-producing ﬁiels.

energy trading. Combined with some

bffshootventiires previously spawned

by Google, energy trading can assist
Google in increasing the amount of
energy it consumes from renewable
sources.’ Asthe CNEI‘ a11icle’s ﬁtle sug-
gests, The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission recently granted Google
the right to begin energy trading op-
erations. ’

The true extent of Google’s aspira- I

tions in the energy industry is unclear.
Google spawned Google Energy, based
in Delaware, in December 2009. With
the nod from FERC, Google will now
be able to use Google Energy to enter

the commodities market to procure C

energy from green sources, either to
regulate its own energy consumption or
to go headlong into the world of energy
commodities trading. .

begn performing similar ﬁinctions to
the wholesale energy trading opera-

Sunday avenged regretful guard

' Ben Duignan .

Staff Writer

Ever-yone remembers the shot. It
sent Villanova to the Final Four
in Detroit and ended the season
for Pitt. ' ‘

- With ﬁve seconds remaining,
Villanova guard Scottie Reynolds
raced down the court, absorbed
contact from Pitt forward Gil-

bert Brown under the basket‘

and scored the winning basket
with a 10th of a second lefton
the clock. ,

Pitt guard- Levance Fields
watched a;possible Final Four
berth vanish before his eyes.

“Reynolds made a great play
going to the basket,” Fields said.
“It'went from having a chance of

going to overtime and possibly

winning the game, to, you know,
the season being over.”
Pitt sophomore forward De-

Juan Blair was hunched over in the
corner of the locker room after

the loss. . 5
“I was getting ready for over-
time,” Blair said. '

There would be no overtime.
And the season that saw Pitt earn
its first ever No. 1 ranking —- and
a N o. 1 seed in the NCAA tourna-
ment — was over.

Whenthe 2009-10 schedule-
was released, Pitt players and
fans circled the Feb. 21 primetime

'-game against the Wildcats.

On Sunday, in front of the
largest on-campus crowd in Pitt
history, the Panthers got their re-
venge, dropping No: 3 Villanova,
70-65. ' _
, Pitt guardjermaine Dixon, the
only starter the Panthers returned
from lastseason, was anointed

with the task of stopping Scottie -

Reynolds on the last play of the
Elite Eight game a year ago.

Dixon immediately took the
' blame for ‘allowing Reynolds to

beat him down the ﬂoor in the
ﬁnal seconds. While Sunday’s

victory doesn’t erase the hurt of o

thelast year’s defeat, it offers a
source of consolation for Dixon.

“I wanted to win this game for
the players that left last year,”
Dixon said. “I felt bad for losing

Now as the Panthers defeated Villanova and surprised critics with many wins thisyear, Jermaine Dixon still leads theteam._

sible, I wanted to win that game
for them.” ‘

But Dixon isn’t looking for -

‘condolences. While revenge is

sweet, the senior knows the win
against the No. 3 Wildcats is sub-
stantial for other reasons.

“Last year is the past for us,”
Dixon said. “The win just gets us
one step closer to winning the
regular season Big East champi-
onship this year.”

The Panthers, picked to ﬁnish
ninth in the preseason Big East
coaches’ poll, now have a legiti-

,, mate shot to conquer a regular

season Big East crown.

At 10-4 in Big East play, Pitt
currently sits tied for third place
in the conference with West Vir-
ginia. ‘

The Panthers are two games
behind Syracuse and one game

behind Villanova, but own the

head-to-head tiebreaker against -

both teams.

Now, a team thatwas written
off to ﬁnish in the bottom half of
the best conference in_America
has a chance to shock the na-
tion.

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon
thinks it starts with the leader
of the team.

“Our guys believe in Jer-
maine Dixon,” Dixon said. “He
gives us conﬁdence, and he’s
our toughest guy. This is his
team.”

In three of Pitt’s six losses,
Jermaine Dixon didn’t play.

In a three-point loss at Seton
Hall, the senior.sat a portion of
the game with a hand injury.

The Baltimore native didn’t

-turn in his best offensive per-

formance on Sunday, shooting
just 3-of-15 from the field. But
Jamie Dixon thinks that stats are
an inconsequential aspect of his
game. -

at our record when [Jermaine
Dixon] has played and when he
hasn’t played. He’s the leader
of this team, and we just follow
him.”

 

— [Jermaine] gives us conﬁdence, and he’s
your toughest guy. This is his team.

Jamie Dixon

“Numbers aren’t so important
to me,” coach Dixon said when
asked about the s'enior’s output
against Villanova. _“You can look

Dixon displayed his leadership
on the defensive side of the ball,
however, shutting down Reynolds
for most of Sunday’s game. The

senior tallied three steals, three
blocks and forced Reynolds into

six turnovers 4- hislsecond most ‘

in a game this year.

TWhen Jermaine Dixon faced «

such harsh criticism for his per‘-
formance in last year’s tourna-
ment game, he took it person-

ally..Dixon blamed himself for

the loss, even though none of his
teammates or coaches angled the
criticism his way.

Now he’s taking the initia-
tive‘ in commanding a much

greater responsibility: leading

his team. '
Jamie Dixon acknowledges the
. senior as the central ﬁgure of this
‘y teamin every aspect-
“When he wants to leave from

a pregame meal, that’s when ‘we _

leave,” coach Dixon, said of Jer-
maine.

shot against Seton Hall Saturday.

 

Redshirt junior guard Brit-
taney Thomas did not have this
issue when the Panthers took on
Louisville at home, though. She
scored a career-high 22‘ points
and led Pitt to a narrow victory.

Pitt dropped Villanova on the
road, 74-69, with Chelsea Cole
and Shayla Scott both tallying
double—doubles and ﬁve Panthers
scoring in double digits;

The team continued this win-
ning stretch to collect its third

consecutive win against the ‘

Seton Hall Pirates, 78-57, on
Saturday. .

Now, the Panthers are gearing
up to take on the DePaul Blue De-
mons (17-10, 6-7 Big East), who
are coming fresh off a 72-63 win
against Marquette.

DePaul is led in scoring by
Sam Quigley, who averages 14.2
points per game. 6-foot—3 Kath-
erine Harry leads the team in re-
bounding and averages 7.5 points
per game. ‘

Deirdre Naughton, a senior
guard on the team and deﬁnitive
leader on the court, tore her right
ACL playing Northwestern at the

beginning of the season.

“Deirdre Naughton has been
the heart and soul of this basket-
ball team,” DePaul head coach
Doug Bruno said. “To lose her
for the season is a devastating
blow to this team. Losing Deirdre
will test the mettle of this year’s
ball club, andwe do expect every
member of our team to step up in
her absence.”

. Recently, sophomore forward
Keisha Hampton stepped up for
the Blue Demons in Naughton’s
absence and scored a career-high

‘28 points against Notre Dame.
Boasting victories against ‘

Cincinnati, Marquette and»Vil-
lanova, DePaul suffered signiﬁ-
cant losses to Notre Dame and

. Connecticut by a combined total

of 57 points. .

DePaul will .close out its season
with Big East games against Syra-
cuse and South Florida, while two
games remain on Pitt’s schedule:
an away game at Cincinnati on

Feb. 27 and a home game against‘

St. John’s on March 1.
T Tipoff is set for 9 p.m. at the
McGrath Arena. ‘‘ -

Yup! Whoa! Oh yahl” along with foreign

Unfortunately, America hasn’t done well
in curling this Olympiad. Curlerjohn Shus-
ter failed to convert four different game-
winning shots, and the United-States started
0-4. Die—hards disavowed their allegiance,

even slandering Shuster’s Wikipedia page g

with things like “[Shuster] currently works
as a quality control specialist for Toyota” and
“Shuster said he draws inspiration from Bill
Buckner, Brad Lidge, Scott Norwood and the
city of Cleveland.”

Women’s Hockey

Women’s hockey is for the hockey fans

that couldn’t live on just three men’s games

per day.

It’s hockey minus hockey. Body checking
is not allowed, and there is no ﬁghting. You
watch as one player wants to wallop another
as they head into the corner but has to pull
up. Take this as a warning, NHL: If you ever
take fighting out of the game, eventually
you’re going to have chaos.

Chaos in women’s hockey takes the form
of “North America crushes everyone.” The
Canadians beat Slovakia 18-0, Switzerland
10-1 and Sweden 13-1. The United States
seems to pass as hard as the other nations
shoot.

The International Olympic Committee
dropped softball from the Summer Olym-
pics because of uneven play, and that might

Speedskating headlines the Olympics,
and the skaters receive a lot of publicity.
Apollo Anton Ohno rivals skier Lindsey Vonn
as far as Olympic stardom goes.

The sport looms even larger in the Neth-
erlands based on Sven Kramer’s ego after
he won gold. A reporter asked him to state
his nameso the recording wou1dn’t later
be misidentiﬁed and so his name would be
pronounced properly.

Kramer’s response: “Are you stupid‘? Hell
no. I’m not going to do that.” Okay, Sven.

Skijoring, Bandy and Glima

The Olympics had all of these events as
demonstration sports atone time or another,
but none continue to this day.

Skijoring merges sled dog racing with
cross—country skiing.iReplace the sled with
skis and you have the general idea.

Bandy combines hockey and soccer. A

The sport has a soccerisized ice surface,
features 11 players per side and even has
corner strokes. '

Glima, meanwhile, is Icelandic folk wres-
tling. “Glima”« means “struggle,” and the
Icelanders call it that because the wrestling
is done standing up. There really is no way
to explain it. ~ _

The only way to understand it is to watch
it. If we’re lucky, maybe someday glima,
bandy and Skijoring, like curling and the
biathlon, will show up in the Olympics —
and on our televisions.
