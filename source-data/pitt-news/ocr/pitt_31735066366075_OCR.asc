Clarifying Policy

  PIRG

By JIM HOSEK

Representatives of Pitt's Public
Interest and Research Group
(PIRG) met with the Student
Govermnent Board June 15 to
discuss the recent decision of the
Board of Trustees, which was
unfavorable to the PIRG cause.

“The Board of Trustees,” said
Bob Steigerwald, PIRG
representative, “has refused to
give proper reasoning to the
students . . . . It’s not fair to any

. student group to be treated the way

PIRG was.”

He was referring to the decision
made by the Board of Trustees
defeating the PIRG proposal to
place a request for funds in invoice
packets.

“They (the Board of Trustees)
have said that it’s not valid,” said
Steigerwald, “but they have not
said why it’s not valid . . . We want
it’ on paper. We want to know why.

“What we're asking for
specifically is that Student
Government request the technical
reasons for the refusal.” '

Tom Baﬂey, Student Govern-
ment Board president, said, in
regard to PIRG in general, “This

Seeks Explanation of 'I‘1'ustee’s Decision  

whole thing has really puzzled me .
. . One time, it’s the hottest thing on
campus. A month later, there’s no
PIRG, to be found."

“The reason you didn't hear
from us,” said Lois Levinson,
another PIRG representative, “is
that we wanted to keep quiet for a
while . . . and not step on anyone’s
toes.”

“The reason they (trustees) are
not giving stated reasons,” added
Bailey, “is because you can take
the greatest lawyers in the nation
and tear it (their opinion) apart,
point by point . . . and they
(Trustees) did not want that.”

A motion was then made by
Board member, Dave Bluey, that
the Board recommend that the
Trustees give reasons for refusal of

PIRG. The motion was passed, 4-1._

Earlier at the SG Board meeting,
Bailey reported that a’ committee
would be formed to discuss tenure.
Made up of 25 members, the
committee will include 10 people
from the Faculty Senate and 10
officials serving under the
Chancellor.

A motion was made to appoint
three student members to the
committee: Bob Stack, board
member; Bob Gedokoh, PITT
NEWS Associate Editor; and Janet
Melnick, nursing student. It was

passed unanimously.

A request for the Board to
petition the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences to institute a course on
Urban Living was one of the first
points of business at the June 22
Board meeting.

Proposed by Pitt Tenant’s Union,
it read “Many students coming
outside the Pittsburgh area have‘
no idea on what to expectas far as
police protection, housing, health
problems and recreation . . . such a
course could be justified as reaf-
firming the University's concern
for its students.”

The proposal was unanimously
passed, but it was stipulated that
Pitt Tenant’s Union conduct the
petitioning.

Six proposals by the Legal
Awareness Committee were then
discussed. The first was concerned
with a September 10 concert to be
held in Pitt Stadium with the Legal
Awareness Committee receiving a
percentage of proﬁts. The proposal
was defeated, 4-1.

The: next suggestion was to
petition the Dean of the Law School
“to grant access to the Law
Library to members of the Legal
Committee.” The motion was
passed unanimously.

Spirit Stays Aﬂoat

by BOB GEDEKOH
Associate Editor .

“I told the old man we was going to get ﬂooded,
but that bastard just sat thereon his ass, drinking and
laughing. Who the hell ever heard of a flood in June
anyway?’-’ She crouched on the curb in the early
morning drizzle, dressed in a pair of baggy blue jeans
and her husband’s flannel shirt, alternately laughing
and crying as she stared at the murky water flowing
down the street and into the windows of her not so
recently painted frame house house.

About forty other residents of the small town

I

- milled around her, talking in hushed tones about the

many floods which had swept through their homes
over the years. “This ain't nothin like the ﬂood that
came through here in '36” one old, shriveled man
said. “Water went clear up to Main Street then,” he
continued. But this was no relief to the dishelved
crowd standing on the street corner watching the
water ﬂow past their second story windows.

The main subject of discussion was the black
muck, hidden by the flowing water, but which would
be all too evident when the waters receded. “You got
to keep workin as the water goes down, scrubben at
that shit before it dries out and gets caked on
everything. Get yourself hose and slosh the muck
away with the clean water,” one ample, elderly
woman told the younger women standing anxiously
around her.

“But what are we going to do if they got our water
shut off?’’, one woman of-about 22 fretted, as she tried
to stop her two children from wading in the dirty
water where their swing set used to stand. The others
just shrugged their shoulders, not from disinterest
but from‘ despair.

Three boys, drenched with the rain and from
wading, perched on the curb just inches above the
water watching an elongated, pale earthworm
struggle futilely in the water-filled gutter, to reach
the comparitively dry mud a few feet away. The two
smaller boys soon lost interest and walked away
laughing, and the third, older youth started to follow
them. Then he stopped, turned, and picked up the
recoiling worm and placed it near the trunk of a
nearby tree.

The local volunteer fire department had their
rowboat tied to a stop sign at the waters edge, and
from time to time residents climbed in and paddled
down the streets to check on their damaged property.

g Town Attempts Flood Recovery

The relatives of one family brought a bright blue
canoe, but little could be accomplished because the
water had not receded; so they took turns cruising
around the block.

The usual quota of curious observers made the
scene, despite the police ’s efforts to discourage them.
They tried to mingle with the group of ﬂood victims,
but even the weariest locals could identify them, with
their dry clothes, orange raincoats and rubber
galoshes. Most of the victims distained the visitors,
but a few elderly men gathered them together with
tales of ﬂoods gone by, obviously delighted at the
transient attention they were receiving.

K Two young men drove into the street with
motorcycles, intent on driving up one alley filled with
two feet of water. Everyone cheered as the first drove
his bike about half way down the street, then laughed
as it stalled and he was forced to dismount into the

,muddy water surrounding him. The second stayed

with the group and laughed at his friend’s efforts to
push the heavy bike through the slop.

Later in the day the water began receding slowly,
and the residents made their way to the corner store
to deplete the supply of mops and detergent. One
blonde girl of about sixteen asked the grey haired
proprieter for- a large bottle of Lysol. “Do you want

- the regular or the pine scented, honey?”, the old

woman asked. The girl stared at her with
amazement, reached out ahd took the pine scented,
and placed her dripping dollar bill on the table.

Few residents of this small town carry ﬂood in-
surance.It is too expensive for their limited budgets;
and besides, most insurance companies are unwilling
to insure houses on “that side of the tracks.” These
people have seen many ﬂoods in their town, and they
will see many more. Many of them vow to move away
after every ﬂood, but few ever do.

One middle aged matron had announced earlier in
the morning, “I told my old man I wanted out of this
dump after the last flood. Now that damn fool can
clean up the mess himself, I'm not gonna lift a
ﬁnger.” Later that day she was seen trudging down
th_e street to her home with a mop over her shoulder.

Some of them can not move for financial reasons.
Others are unwilling to expend the energy moving
requires. But most of them stay because their friends
and relatives are staying, and because . . . the town is
their home. This is the first ﬂood to hit the town in
nearly ﬁve years; who knows, there may never be
another. .

loan students for amounts up to
$100 for legal services was
unanimously passed. Students will
be permitted three months to
repay the money. Another fund,
however, was defeated by the
Board. It would have put $20,000
into a special account for Pitt
students who could not raise bail
money for minor violations of the
law.

The .last Legal Awareness
Committee-sponsored motion also
passed unanimously. It was a
suggestion to petition the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences “for more
courses in practical law for
students.”

The Allocations Committee then
presented their recommendations
for various organizations’ budgets.
A “lessened” budget for the Zero
Population Group of $19,350 was
analyzed. The Allocations Com-
mittee recommended the abolition
of the organizations publication,
EARTHRIGHT, eliminating $1,740
from their budget.

It was decided that the Board
would request $580 for this
publication, sending the budget

back to the Allocations Committee.
Other complaints of reduction of

line items, however, were ignored. -

The Board passed budgets for

Men’s Council Activities Fair‘

($2,730), Revolutionary Socialist
Union ($1,955) and the OWL
($18,885.56). It, however, refused to
pass the William Pitt Debating
Union’s budget of $9,000 “until
their allocation of a room in the
Student Union for trophies has
been eliminated.”

A budget of $370 for Quo Vadis,

organization of the nationality
room hostesses in the Cathedral of
Learning, was passed with a
warning that they would not be
funded by the SG next year. V

“The Quo Vadis organization,”
said‘ Dave Bluey, Board member,
“is more of a» service to the
University (as public relations)
and not to the students.

“If the Pitt students want to see
the nationality rooms, they can do
it without the hostesses,” he added.

Other organizations’ budgets for
the fiscal year beginning July 1 will
be discussed at tonight’s Board
meeting.

D.C. 0r,g’(mizutioIL to

Give Federal Aid Info.

BY JIM HOSEK

The University of Pittsburgh,
according to James F. Carroll, Pitt
Legislative Aide, has recently
established relations with the
office of Federal Programs (OFP)
in Washington, which will help Pitt
compete more effectively with
other universities’ attempts to
receive federal funds.

OFP, first established in 1967 by
the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities
(AASCU), will make it easier for
Pitt to be informed of new federal
programs and their changing
personnel and procedures.

“The university,” said Carroll,
“cannot afford a full—time lobbyist
or secretary. It’s a lot easier to
have a consultant (such as OFP)
and right now be more efficient.”

The main objective of the contact
with OFP.is “to get funds through
federal resources. "

Lou T‘ronzo, Asst. director of
Government Relations and Public
Affairs, said, “With this program,

we hope that AASCU will be able to
match upmoneytowhat we need.

It already serves a number of
other universities.

One of the primary roles of the
OFP, which is basic to receiving
any type of federal fimd, is that it
serves as an information center
linking campus representatives to
federal agency and private
foundation program personnel. .

Jerold Roschwalb, director of
OFP, in Washington, recently
visited Pitt “to acquaint us with
the program,” according -to
Tronzo.

Roschwalb, as head, has worked
to get OFP’s information center as
comprehensive as possible".
“Background information is up-
dated regularly and includes
authorizing legislation, committee
reports and other pertinent in-
formation. _

“The Office of Federal
Programs, however,” added
Tronzo, “is merely a source — only
one.”

Pitt Poet-Phys icirut
Treats Tmtgibles

by BOB GEDEKOH

Carlyle once said "our main
business is not to see what lies
dimly at a distance, but to do
what lies clearly at hand.” Hard-
ly the philosophy poets, who
often seem content to deal with
intangibles and intellectual exer-
cises. But it is the philosophy of
Stuart Elovitz,’ an eye surgeon
at Pitt’s Medical Center and a
poet who has recently publish-
ed his first book Poetry by Pre-
scription.

Elovitz’s work deals with tan-
gible experiences with which
he is familiar; eye surgery,
the’ treatment of alcoholics,

. and addicts death and the frus-

trations of a medical career. Not
the sort of subjects covered by
most modern poets, many of
whom seem to be caught up in a
web of avant-garde mumbo-
jumbo.

.When Elovitz deals with his.

profession it is with extreme
frankness. He paints a vivid
picture of cancer in “The Crab”
by explicitly describing the var-
ious symptoms (i.e. bleeding
wombs,_ lumps on breasts and
hacking coughs). In “Eye Sur-
geon” ‘he conveys the intensity
and pressures of a cataract oper-
ation, relating the manipulations
of a surgeon to the movements
of a mantis.

But he best portrays the frus-
trations of his career in “Se-
quelae and Reflections’. as he re-
flects on incidents which have
influnced him. He concludes:

“l have seen misery and sut-
ering. A
Realize that there is no sub-
stitute for compassion Under-
stand that life is transient-
fleeting And changes like the
leaf of an autumn tree.
HANDLE IT GENTLY."

The poetry relating to medi-
cine is surprising in its frank-
ness, for not many of us are un-
accustomed to encountering
physicians who have laid aside
their professional shields which
serve to keep them at a respect-
able distance from their patients.
His poetry enables the reader
to view a‘ physician as a human
bding, subject to the problems.
hdarbrreaks and self doubts
which plagues everyone.

Although some of Elovitz‘s
imagery and rhyme has been
used once too often, a great deal
of it is refreshing in this day of
unmetered form where rhyming
is considered a sin by the “cul-
tured.”

Submerged Terror Bares Aruliertce

Subtlety: Fatal Hitch‘ in Trenzy’

Stanley Cavell has noted that
Alfred Hitchcock’s genius lies in
“the perception of a familiar locale
as a natural setting for a hitherto
unrelated individual task or
predicament.” Once Hitchcock
establishes the familiar, he slyly
asks, “Whatifone day. . . . ”

What if one day you suddenly
found yourself implicated in in-
ternational intrigue and wanted for
murder? THE THIRTY-NINE‘
STEPS. What if one day you ac-
cidentally discovered that your
kindly Uncle Charlie had brutally
murdered several helpless old
women? SHADOW OF A DOUBT.
What if one day a charming
psychopath sat down beside you on
the train and cheerfully offered to
exchange murders? STRANGERS
ON A TRAIN.

He has built a career by telling
us time and again, “It could
happen to you.” Who knows what
evil lurks in the heart. of middle
class men? Alfred Hitchcock,
that’s who. His notion of terror
might have been borrowed from
Auden: “how it takes place —
While someone else is eating or
opening a window or just walking
dully along.”

He illustrates this very line in
“FRENZY”. While his psychopath
escorts the unsuspecting victim to
what the audience knows will be
her death, Hitchcock executes a
virtuoso dolly, pulling the camera

slowly back down the stairs down
the hall, and out into the street,
revealing middle class London
walking dully along, oblivious to
the horror being perpetrated in-
side.

The audience, however, is
equally oblivious to the doings on
screen, and talks to itself. “I’H say
one thing for him,” said a friend
during this scene, “he has good
camerawork.” I mention this
remark only because it was all he
said during the picture. The rest of
the audience never stopped
talking. They were somewhat quiet
at the beginning, perhaps realizing
thatinattention might cause them
to miss Hitchcock’s customary
appearance as an extra. Once they
spotted him, they never shut up.

To be fair, they did occasionally
look at the screen. Now and then
they even reacted. During the on-
screen murder they laughed at the
psychopath and his constant
repetition of the word _“lovely”,
while breathing more heavily than
any villain since Igor. ~

They gasped when the victim’s
tongue popped out. They also
paused momentarily when the
corpse kicked back at the mur-
derer, thought “Oh, rigor mortis”,
and went on talking. I did hear
some murmer “Galloping Gour-
met” as the detective’s wife served
up her series of exotic, unap-
petizing meals." When the picture

for 12 years and two years with the
powerful New York Rangers of the
NHL scored a hat trick in that
game to put the Pitt skaters down,
3-2

In 1966-67 season, McGregor
scored 44 goals for the Rangers.
On Pitt’s side, Denny Bro

scored both goals. —

On Monday night. last, the
Skaters had little trouble recording
their eight victory of the summer
season ‘as they trounced Churchill
9-2. Good Pitt play and goals were
common in that game, thanks to
the erratic Churchill squad.

The summer skaters will get
back into action Tuesday night
against the Trojans, also at the
Cnalet.

Earlier in the campaign, the Pitt
Icers were handed the first shutout
of their history. A powerful
Warrior team, headed by a former
NCAA championship team
member, Jeff Garvey, pushed the
puck past Pitt netminders an
imlucky 13 times while keeping the
Icers away from their own nets.

The second loss suffered by the
Icers was at the hands of the Blues.
Not to be confused with the team
from St. Louis, the Blues did the
job on the team and handed them a
7-2 shellacking, regardless.

Most of the Pitt Hockey Club
members are participating in the
summer play. Joe Testa, the
Browne brothers, Mark Lieberman
and others have and will continue
to don the skates for the rest of the
summer schedule.

In making the trip to» the
Newtown Square, Pa., workshop,
the “Pitt Crew” is sacrificing a
trip to the June Sprints, the largest
Sports Car Club of America
National race weekend in the
country, held at the Road America
circuit near Elkhart Lake, Wis.

Handling and steering problems
have plagued the Pitt machine
since the start of the season.
However, they failed to prevent the
car from winning its first outing,
May 21, at the Nelson Ledges track
near Warren, Ohio. The Pitt team
is next scheduled to compete in an
SCCA National race July 2 at Lime
Rock, Conn. '

 

in 72-73 Fold

The Pittsburgh Penguins made it
an even dozen signings last week,
with the annoilicement that right
wing Jean Pronovost had agreed to
terms for one year for the 1972-73
season. ‘

Pronovost enjoyed" his finest
season with Pittsburgh last year
when he became the first Penguin
in history to score 30 goals in one
season (later equalled by Greg
Polis). Pronovost also set a club
record by scoring a goal a game in
seven consecutive games during
March.

The 26-year old forward has
averaged over 20 goals a season
since joining the Penguins in 1968.
He was the Penguins’ roolde of the
year in 1968-69 and for the past
three seasons has won the Player's
Player Award on a vote by his

teammates.’ .

He also became the first player
in Pittsburgh history to win the
Most Valuable Player Award for
the second time. He won it the first
time in 1969-70 and was the pick of
the fans again this past season.

Previous signings include
goalies Jim Rutherford and Cam
Newton, defensemen Darryl
Edestrand, Bryan Watson, Duane
Rupp, Sheldon Karmegiesser, and
Larry Bignell, and forwards Syl
Apps, Greg Polis, Steve Cardwell,
and Bryan Hextall.
