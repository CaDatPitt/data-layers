TENNIS TEAM DOES WELL 1

Pitt’ Ties With Grove City For First

Place. in Intercollegiate Tennis

Tournament at Geneva.

Pitt closed a successful season last
week by tying for ﬁrst place in the
big ‘Intercollegiate meet held at’Ge-
neva college Thursday and Friday.

, The -m.eet was bitterly contested from

beginning to end and the greatest
credit is due our boys for the enviable
they made. Pitt showed
championship class when they beat
the Grove City double team in the

j play ‘off and are really entitled to
‘ first honors... McElroy was playing in

top notch form, and had no trouble
winning the singles. Sloan was a tri-

S ﬁe erratic but fought hard for every

game. Mackrell and Gilbert, a new
double team, had hard work winning
their matches due to their inexperi-
ence in doubles, but their individual
playing abilities asserted themselves
and they Won out. They were strong
at the net and killed almost every lob.

//‘Mackrell was last year’s singles chain-

lpion but this year went into doubles

’ to strengthen the team as a wholes

and succeeded in winning his second
gold medal.

- _The work of Billy McEllroy, the

Junior Champion of Western Pennsyl-
vania, was easily the feature of the
day. A. None of the matches in which

,/ he played, were" carried beyond two
’ -sets,

and the .highest score made
against him was three games in two

6‘ sets. ‘In all he won forty-eight out of
‘ ﬁfty-six games.

This boy is but a
Freshman and the future looks good
for him. With such a_ beginning, he
should be a great star in his succeed-

T ing years. ~

The prospects for a successful team
next year are very bright, for every
on:e of the present team will be back
in School. — Last year Pitt won the in-

. tercollegiate and this year the Pitt]:

team tied for ﬁrst. Next year with all
df our old men back, our team should
easily win this big meet.

- . The Pitt team was as follows:

Class A Singles——Sloan, ’12.
Class B. Singles——McEllroy, '14. [
‘Doubles—\Vilbert, ’l3 and Mackrell, '
’12.
,The results were as follows:
.- Class A’Sing|es~.
' Pitt beat Allegheny, (default).
Grove City beat Pitt, 6-2, 6-1.
Geneva beat Pitt, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1.

Addition to
  University

 

Dr.. Crafer Appointed Assistant Prof-
fessor of Sociology_.

 

Dr Thomas W. B. Crafer has been

appointed assistant professor of socio-
logy in the school of economics of the
University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Crafer‘
in Middleburg
College and will take up his duties at
the UniV€1‘Sity in September. He.» has
received the degree of doctor of phil-
osophy from the University of Wiscon-
sin, and also that of bachelor of laws
from" the Boston 5 University Law
School. VVhile holding the sociology
fellowship in the University of Wis-

is teaching this year

sin, he resided and worked in the Uni- -

versity Settlement in Milwaukee. Dur-

ling this residence he investigated cer-

tain economic aspectslof of tubercu—§
losis, the results of which were em-
bodied in a paper read before the In‘-
ternational Tuberculosis Congress in
1908. ‘

It is expected that with the addition
to the teaching force the university.
will be able to cooperate much more
fully with the organizaions of‘ this
district in sociology, phianthropy and
settlement work and to supply young
men and women specially trained to
assume the leadership in these move-
ments. . 1 . .

Musical.%Clubs A  
Make Plans

Glee .and Mandolin Clubs Prepare For
S\uccessIful Season Next Year.

The Glee and Mandolin Clubs of the
Iniversity of Pittsburgh during the
last year has had one of the most suc-
cessful seasons in its history. In one

“respect it has been the most success-

ful. Thisvis the factor that it has been
in advertising the university. Through
its very successful concerts and
dances the musical clubs have given
the university a wide publicity during
the las tyear. ‘ , .
For next year the most elaborate
plans are now being laid. The State-
Pitt concert and dance which was one

-of Pittsburg'h’s’ ﬁne scoial events of
- the year will be [made permanent if

the management’ is able to complete
its plans. « As this year a large‘num-
ber of concerts were given in the sur-
rounding district, the club will have
no diﬂiculty in securing similar en-
gagements for next year. The ﬁne re-
ception given the club and the good
reputation it has acquired in the last
two or three years, make it a desir-
able and popular organ'iz-ation.

One feature of last season was the
ﬁnancial success attained by the
clubs.. Ordinarily such clubs are a
losing venture, but this year proved
the exception. The returns from the
State concert gave the club a good

' start ﬁnancially and it-was not embar-

rassed byulack of funds throughout
the entire season. This especially
ﬁne showing ‘Qodes well for the future
prospect of this school organization.
The next year’s manager expressed
himself as verycptimistic over the
prospects for a similar ﬁnancial’ suc-
cess next year. '
The plans for next. year include a

vania, Ohio and \Vest Virginia. The

l-‘lalferty ’13, Medical Will Lead Pitt-

Next Year on Track.

At. a meeting of the track letter

men held Thursday, Homer Emil Hal-~.

ferty, ’l3, a student in the Medical
School was,elected captain for the
1912 season. Halferty has won his

letter for the past three years and has v

an excellent record. [He was ameth-
ber of the relay team that holds the
university record. The other mem-
bers of the team were Ross, Robinson
and Weger. Last year Halferty ran
on the team that took second to West-

minster in the intercollegiate meet. .

He did consistent work during the
season just closed, running on the var-
sity relay team and in the‘ hurdles.

Ex-captain Bryson'was not a candi--

date for re-election. -Ml

/ Of this year’s point winners Pitt

will lose only Tinsley, Lindsay and A

Wooten by graduation. VVith Rosen-
thal and Davis in the sprints, Bryson
and Halferty in the middle distances,
Lichtenfels in the mile and two-mile,
Galvin, Gehlert and Dallenbach in the
weights and McKinney in the pole
vault, a nucleus for an excellent team
will be on hand. Besides these letter
men there were a number of promis-
ing youngsters out for/the team this
year who will undoubtedly develop
into point winners next spring. The

Blue and Gold adherents are placing

much hope in the number of prep
school stars who have expressed their
intentions of ‘entering Pitt in the fall.

Captain-elect Halferty is known as. A

a_hard worker and a loyal Pitt boost-
er. If there is a winning team in the
wood he should bring it out. He has
the best wishes of a host of friends in_
all departments. “

COMMENCEMENT.

Vit11‘tl:~ rapid passage of the one
week sczrcrating us from commence-
ment, 1'; 1- time. during which our Sen-
iors xvi‘; be with us steadily short-
-ens.  with the coming of June 14,
we will- lcTCe from our midst the pres-
ent upper class. This class is the
largest V. hich has ever graduated
from the ‘university, numbering about
357* memisers. Congratulations are
due ‘the graduating class“ for their
work in successfully passing the four
wczk required. Every year
the number of graduates is increasing
The class this year is but another
sign of the rapid growth our school
is making.

With thexpresent graduating class
a strong spirit of loyalty will be add-
ed to the alumni. It will be the duty
-of the class of 1911 to aid in the
work of our school even more than
when it was an undergraduate class.
The very fact that it has“ joined the
ranks of alumni should be its strong-
est incentive to school loyalty. This
duty’ before the Senior class, we know
it will not forget. Never can the
graduates forget the four happy, yet

A busy years they have spent together

in Pitt. Never can they escape, even

stinctive Pitt spirit which ﬁlls every

A CC-OPERATIVE STORE

Several clays ago one of the promi-

/nent Ipembers of the faculty made the
‘suggestion that he would like to see
the school ‘book store run on the co- I

operative basis. By this we under-
standitlsz-.t. a good manager be well

I I paid, for running the store, but that

the 3;r:.."’_: :;t the end of the year be
C7\'f'.r_‘_.;c.l 1;: among the students who

,;  p:‘.:’:;iized the ‘store in propor-

tion to the amount they have spent.
This .,plan is in force in many of the
larger universities of this country at
the present time and has been much
discussed in this school.

The present time is the best time
in the‘ school year for the inaugura-
tion of such a system. With the com-
ing of a new term, if the co-operative
plan were adopted, it should be in-
stalled at the beginning of the term.
In advocating such a. ulan, we do not
wish‘ to criticise the present man-
agement. Our bookstore at the pres-
ent time is very eﬂicient. It has ﬁlled

W a place which would otherwise have

been completely neglected. But, as
our present form of book store has
been successful in the past, we now
believe that the way is open for an-
other advance. The success of the

.stcre in the past has prepared the

way for the like success of a co-oper-
ative store. M

The advantages of the store run on
this basis are many. One of the most
important is that the students would
take a greater interest in it and thus
be able to secure their books and sup-
plies at a lower price. The ‘money
spent for books and other,.supplies
reaches a large amount in the course
of a four year’s college term. So any
lowering in the p-rices would mean a
great saving to the college ‘student.
At many colleges the saving in this
way amounts to from‘ ten to twenty
percent. This means a large help to
our boys. I For the average student
at Pitt is not wealthy. Unlike many,
rich schools many men at Pitt are
working theinway through school.
Consequently in the saving secured
by the co-operative plan it would be
thoroughly desirable.

PITT WEEKLY ELECTION

The announcement of the resigna-
tion" of'one of the Weekly Board was
made last week. To ﬁll the vacancies
on this board men must, soon be chos-
en. In the choice of men great care
‘should be exercised. ' The success of
the Weekly depends to a large degree
upon the strength of the men on its
board._ Friendship or popularity must
not enter into this election, if compe-
tent men are to be chosen.' For such
a position in which a large amount of
careful, painstaking work is required,
only capable men should be chosen.

This election, moreover, should be
attended by every man in the school.
The man who does ’not come has no
right to say one word of condemna-
tion of the choice of those present.
Let the man who wants to be a stay-
at-home nonenity be such, but let
him keep his mouth shut. The man
who desires to take no part in college
activities should not criticise those
who do so desire. Every man surely
has enough pride in him to attend this
election and vote for the men he con-
siders best ﬁtted for the position.

EMPLOYMENT BUREAU

The different professors of the uni-
versity have in the past been doing
very efficient work in securing work

Pitt men during vacation. This year

I

THE PITT WEEKLY

they are again placing students who
are in need of positions. But one
feature of the present method of se-
curing positions seems to us to be
rather cumbersome. Each school at-
tempts to place its own men. Now,
we believe that there should be a reg-
ular Bureau of Student Employment
to which the students could go direct-
ly. Such a plan would relieve many
of the professors of the arduous work
which falls upon them at the present
time. It is true that our professors
have been doing very good work along
this line, but at commencement time
they are necessarily busy with their
work and it is very difficult for them
to secure the time needed to secure
our men positions. The establishment
of sucha bureauois of course impossi-
ble this year, but it seems to us that
next year such a step would prove a
great help. I

SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS MAKES
GROWTH.

Great M Increase in Enr'ollment—New
Courses to be Given.

 

.As the School of Economics ap-
proaches its ﬁrst mile stone, it is
gratifying to record that a large meas-
ure of success has attended this new
venture, amply justifying its estab-
lishment as a. separate department of
the University. In the day
ﬁfty three students have been enrolled
and in the evening school one hundred
twenty-eight, making a total enroll-
ment of one hundred eighty one.” The
new school, however, sets its face
toward the future rather -than the
past. The faculty has been enlarged
and strengthened, which will enable
each instructor to devote himself more

special branch. Mr. Ira G. Flocken, A.
M., of the University of Illinois has
been appointed instructor in Industry
and Accounting, and will give courses
in general economics, industry, ac-
counting, and insurance. Dr. Francis
Newton Thorpe, formerly ‘professor of
constitutional law in the University
of Pennsylvania and a recognized au-
thority on this subject, will give the
courses in political science, including
a new course in American constitu-
tional law. Dr. T. W. B. Crafer, who
comes from Middlebury College, will
have charge of the sociology. courese,
which will be strenghtened along
practical and cooperative lines. It is
hoped that next year the foundations
\can be laid for the establishment, in
connection with this department, of a
school for social workers similar in
scope and purpose to the schools in
-New York, Phiadelphia, and St. Louis.
Dr. Crafer is_ also a graduate in law
and will probably offer some courses
in this subject. Mr. Joseph R. Conrad
will continue to give the course in
business law. Dean Holdsworth will
give the courses in ﬁnance, invest-
ments, brokerage, and will offer two

‘ HGVV COILTSGS, one II] QCOIIOIIIIC resourc-

es, the other in public ‘finance and tax—-
ation. Dr. Holdsworth will also offer
a graduate course ‘in the money mark-
et. Other graduate courses will be of-

fered by lflr. Crat-‘er in sociology, and

classes .

exclusively to the development of his‘

by Dr. ‘Thorpe in poitical science._
In the evening school several chang-
es will occur and considerable exten-

sion of the work is projected. Profes-.

sor Joseph A. Beck, who has been the
head of the school for the past three.

years, has resigned and the adminis—.

trative work of both day ad evening _

departments will be under Dr. Holds-. . ' I

worth’s direction. Mr. Beck, however,
will continue as a member of the

teaching staff of the evening school;

The work in accounting will be great-
ly strengthened by the addition of two

new courses, one in auditing, the other
in cost accounting, both to be given,

by Mr. Flocken. ‘A new course in pro-
perty insurance and real estate will be
given by Mr. Conrad and Mr. Chu.bb,
and one in transportation by Dr. Cra-
fer. Much interest will be taken in the‘
new course in Journalism. This course

will serve as an introduction -to more‘
extended courses to ‘be »given in sub-;

sequent years. The course will be prac_
tical and thorough, being in charge of
an active newspaper editor who will be
assisted by editors and managers of
other newspapers, magazines, and
trade journals. Next year the. course
will be given in the evening school in
order that young men engaged during
the day in newspaper work or other
employment may take advantage of 
It may be taken,’ however, by day stud-

ents who have had the necesssary pre- ‘

paration.

PREPARATIONS FOR
I CELEBRATION

Faculty and Trustees Decide to. Hold '
Great Pageant on 1912 Anniversary ‘

At a meeting of a committee of the ’
trustees and faculty last week it was‘

decided to hold a great historical pa-
geant next February on the 125th an-

niversary of—the university. This. pa-,.-

geant will commemorate the‘ many
great marks in the history of the
city and University of Pittsburgh. Men
have already been secured to work
on this immense undertaking, and
from now, until next February the
members of our faculty and trustees
will be constantly devoting their en-
ergies to making the event the great-
est in the history of Pittsburgh.
Although as yet the plans are not
deﬁnitely determined yet it is prob-
able that a large amount. of time and

attention will be devoted to the stu-
Dyess, who is “

dent activities. Dr.
much in demand on all such historical
questions will investigate the history.
of the city and of the university. A
strong committee of the faculty has
been appointed to lay plans for the af-
fair and will doubtless work all sum-
mer on laying the plans for the cele-
bration. Besides the pageant, many
other events will take place on the
week devoted to Pitt’s one hundred
and twenty-ﬁfth anniversary. Several
of the student club-s have expressed
their desire to be given representa-
tion during the week and probably
this will be given them.

..N EW CATALOGU E APPEARS

(Continued from page 1)

Perhaps the most remarkable thing
noted by the students is the remark-

' able growth shown by a comparison
4 of the new-catalogue and that of last

year. 

In the last year the number of reg-
-ular students in the university has in-
creased from 1,261 to almost 1,700.
Then the new list of enrolled students
shows that the university is becom-
ing the center of educational Pitts-
burgh, that. its lectures are instruct-
ing a large number of teachers at
points through the western end of
the state. The growth of the facul-
ty is most remarkable increasing in
one year from one hundred and eighty
five to two hundred and twenty-ﬁve.
The library has during the last year
received over 1,000 new books. In
the laboratories a large amount of
new machinery-has been installed. A
great mimber of new courses have

N been added to the curriculum.

These are but a few-of the many ad-
vances made by Pitt during the last
year. The catalogue ,of this year
shows a--growth along all lines which
the student might not realize," were it
not for such a summary.

men who were fortunate enough to be
members of the club thisiyear were
amply repaid "for their time and ef-
forts by the good times which they
had wherever they went. It will be
well worth while for any man to come
"out for the clube next year. The of-

WILL START DEN-
' ‘ —TlSTRY BUILDING
Announcement is made that work

will start immediately on -the building

to be occupied by the School of Den-
tistry. The completion of this build-
ing next fall will see the Coming of

another department of the university

to the new campus. The work will be
rushed forward and the new building
will be ready for occupancy early next
fall. It will be a large building of the
same type as the others on the cam-
pus‘ and will greatly aid in ﬁlling out
the group now rapidly increasing.
Plans are also being prepared for
beautifying the campus and making
it one of the most beautiful places in
this city. The opportunity for such
action is unlimited, for in no place
could a site better adapted be found.

With the improvements announced in -

this and preceding issues of the Pitt
Weekly, the university" will soon be-
gin to look like the original plan
adopted by the trustees.

GREAT CONVENTIONS FOR PIT_T.
Philological and Archaeological Asso-
ciations to Meet at Pitt next
December

The University of Pittsburgh has
been signally honored by two asso-
ciations of national scope. The Amer-
ican Philological Association and the
Archaeological Institute of America
have decided to accept the invitation
to hold --their next annual joint meet-
ing at the University of Pittsburgh on
December 7-29, 1911. The American

years old. The Archaeological Insti-
tute is over 30 years old. ,It covers the

ﬁeld of Greek, Roman, Oriental and

excavations in Greece, .Asia,. Africa

I by remembering that these associa-_

known universities in the country. In
recent years their meetingsihave been
at Brown, John Hopkins, Toronto,
7Chicago, Princeton. All meetings ex-
cept the joint meetings in the evening
Iwiu be held at the University; the
_ evening meetings being held in the
lecture hall of the Carnegie Library
because the University has no assem-
bly room large enough. The Univer-

probably given in the new gymnasium
and other social features willibe ar-
ranged. I .

IPROMINENT ALMUNUS HONORED.

Mesta '85 Entertains Convention. Has
‘New Machine.

One of the most prominent members
of ‘the local committee which enter-
tained the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers was George Mesta,
‘85, President or the“ Mesta Machine

I .
Co.

Mr. Mesta was also chairman of
the Finance Committee of the conven-
tion. Of the-trips taken by the dele-

gates to the surrounding works, that I

to the Mesta Machine Co. was one of
the most interesting.

Mr. Mesta has recently brought from

‘Germany Prof. Dussedorf, who is the

inventor of a new type of hydraulic
forging press. The Mesta Machine
Co. now owns the patent for this im-
proved machine. At present the one
in operation at their plant is the only
one in the country. The new inven-
tion saves space, friction and force.
besides giving far more ﬂoor space

than the-old method. It is more com-_

pact and more self-contained.
