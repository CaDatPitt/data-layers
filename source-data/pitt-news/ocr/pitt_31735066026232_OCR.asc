GREENSBURG —— Pitt—Greensburg’s
newly installed president said thoroughly
preparing his Pitt students for the coming
century is one of the chief challenges he
plans to tackle.

Oakland’s neighbor
campus, President Frank
Cassell said, must main-
tain the faculty, facilities
and technology so its grad-
uates can compete in the
world arena.

“I think the challenge
is always this: You get
young people getting out
of high school who grew
up in a particular place in the country,
and the job of higher education, in part,
is to prepare these people to become
world-class citizens,” said Cassell.

“We do live in a global economy,” he
continued, “and the students who we
train and educate and graduate have to be
able to walk the streets of world capi-

 

New Greensbur president vows to prepare students

tals.”

Cassell was officially installed yes-
terday in a ceremony held in Pitt-
Greensburg’s newly constructed auditori-
um in Smith Hall. A

A long procession of gowned admin-
istrators, faculty and students led him to
the ceremony from the
nearby Millstein Library
and encountered the music
of the Westmoreland
Symphony Brass Quintet
upon entering the auditori-
um.

Following the perfor-
mance of the national
anthem and invocation,
various campus and com-
munity leaders offered
Salutations, including University Provost
James Maher; Diane Marsh, Chancellor’s
Distinguished Teaching Award—winning
psychology professor, and Student
Government Association President Brian
McPeak. .

THE PITT NEWS

Novotny tells a story on the piano about clowns in the circus throwing acid cream pies. A

Stories without words

Jeff Novotny is a storyteller and
loves to use imagery to make sure his
audience sees the story.

But unlike most storytellers,
Novotny’s medium is not a pen. It is a
piano.

Novotny, a music and philosophy
major at Pitt, is a composer who employs
his music to tell stories —— he uses the
differences between sounds to play on
feelings familiar to the audience. This, he
says, helps him relay ideas that most
people normally wouldn’t understand.

“Music, to me, is most powerful
when it is a form of communication,”
said Novotny.

Each of his musical compositions
has a story tacked onto it. The music fol-
lows the storyline, changing in sound as
the story changes in mood.

Novotny’s musical career began 14
years ago
with his
first piano
lesson. He
said he
w o u l (1
leave time
e v e r y
morning to
p r a c tic e
playing the
p i a n 0
before school.

Though his musical ability did
extend beyond the piano — he began
playing trumpet two years after the piano
— composing never crossed Novotny’s
mind until, at age 16, his piano teacher
asked him to write a piece for a competi-
tion as part of a music festival.

Though not expecting to win with
his first composition, Novotny had fun
with the project and wrote a jazz piece
titled “F1amin’ Raymond.” The composi-
tion won first place.

At the festival, the winner of the
teachers’ composition category told

 

Thursday, 26 March 1998

  

méliild/v\V:l;\h'/19‘ 3I<lCll3 v:)3a93>r

Novotny that he liked his piece better

than his own. 
Novotny said that after he won the ‘a

competition, he had the conﬁdence he
needed to continue writing music. Q
“It showed that I really had the tali:

ent,” said Novotny. 

Novotny began writing music with#{
out any training and had written numer—§§
ous compositions before his first musical 5
composition class —— an informal study
with composer and Pitt Professor Anne 5
LeBaron.

Novotny said he has always written
music that reﬂected his “bizarre ant"
morbid sense of humor,” including .1
suite that mimicked the classic piano
piece “Pachelbel’s Canon.” His piece
was a Latin American version titled,
“Taco Bell’s Canon.”

He said writing music that reﬂectss
his humor
creates the
feelings he
wants lis-
teners to
share, and
that this
allows him
to express
the “weird
i d e a s
inside” him»
that others may not otherwise under-
stand.

“I love to be moved,” said Novotny.
“I love my blood to boil.”

His newest composition, “Circus,”
will be performed by the Pitt Symphonic
Orchestra on April 5 at 1 p.m. The com-
position is one of his favorites. It lets his
humor and tonal style come through the
music in a mixture of happy sounds that
turn sour.

Novotny began the composition
over a year ago and obtained a
Brackenridge Fellowship independent

Getting ca foot in the door

Students find opportunities at internship fair

Carrie Hager
Staff Writer

Deborah Petrick, a junior film
studies major, said she attended yester-
day’s Pitt internship fair to get her foot
in the door and find a job.

She said she feels internships give
students a great opportunity to gain
experience and begin networking.

“I think it’s a really great advan-
tage. You can meet people who will
give you a chance and help for when
you are in the real world,” she said.

More than 80 companies and 12
summer camps were represented yes-
terday at an internship fair in the
William Pitt Union.

Students who attended were able
to obtain information about a variety
of internships. Some of the companies
and organizations represented includ-
ed Interactive Media Systems Inc.; the
Allegheny County Coroner’s Ofﬁce;
WQED Pittsburgh; and the Central
Blood Bank, just to name a few.

Alvin Caldwell J r., a pediatric neu-

ropsychologist, said he that believes

internship fairs are helpful to students.

“It is a great way to touch base
with students and put names to faces.”
Caldwell explained that through
internships, “students can gain men-
tors, make connections, and define
themselves. They can also apply them-
selves in a field of interest or even
carry training to something else.”

Other representatives also felt the
internship fair was beneficial to stu-
dents.

Eugene Baily of Community
Options in Pittsburgh said that through
internships students “can enhance
growth in fields they are majoring in
and get a feel for jobs and explore their
options.” He added that internships

give students hands-on experience. ’

Tracy A. Sugra, adult program
director of the McKeesport YMCA
said, “Internships give students a taste
of the real world. It prepares them for
the future by giving them the experi-
ence employers are looking for.”

Many of the students who attended
said they obtained a lot of useful infor-
mation and would definitely attend
similar fairs in the future.

Junior Kevin Knox, a chemistry
and applied-math major, said he
attended to see what jobs were avail-
able.

“It’s well—organized, and there are
a diversity of opportunities,” he said.

Connie Way, of the College of Arts

.and Sciences, which helped organize

yesterday’s internship fair, said there
was a mass—marketing campaign to
reach students and that 2,300 recruit-
ing letters were sent out to students to
inform them about the event.

“The internship fair was an oppor-
tunity for students to explore interests,
speak with representatives, secure
internships, and see what’s available,”
Way said.

Senior Shannon McCabe also
helped organize the event. She said
starting in December, she worked
every day in’ planning the event. Once
the organizers found some companies
interested in attending, she said she
worked with Pitt’s colleges to com-
plete the planning.

McCabe said students can really
benefit from attending an internship
fair.

“It helps students to find out what
appeals to them. An internship is a
good foundation.” she said.
“Internships are a way for students to
make money since about half of them

_are paid internships.”

a strong leader to guide UPG into the
next decade. In my four years, I’ve seen
UPG change for the better, and I hope
President Cassell can continue that pos-
itive momentum,” said McPeak.

Cassell, 57, was named the third
president of Pitt-Greensburg last June
and officially began
his responsibilities
here in August. He
came from Roosevelt
University in Illinois,
where he served as
vice provost and dean
of the Albert A. Robin
Campus.

person, “a character trait that cannot be
overvalued in an institution whose prin-
ciple resources are human-.”
Nordenberg said both he and Maher
are pleased to recruit someone of
Cassell’s “stature and accomplishments
to this important position. Luckily, it
would appear that Dr.
Cassell felt equally
fortunate that this
position was being
made available to him.
It was, in that sense,
one of those marriages
made in heaven.”
Cassell was soon

Prior to that, he thereafter officially
taught history at the installed I by
University of Nordenberg and
Wisconsin at Maher as UPG presi-

Milwaukee" and held
several administrative
positions there
including chairman of
the history depart-
ment, assistant chan-
cellor for university
relations, and interim . "H"
dean of the School of Social Welfare.

He earned his bachelor of arts
degree in history at Indiana’s Wabash
College and earned his master’s and
doctorate in history at Northwestern
University. He and his wife Beth have
two children, David and Jonathan.

Pitt Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said Cassell is known for being a people

dent, to resounding
applause from the
audience.

“[Cassel1] comes
to the University of
Pittsburgh with a rep-
utation as a builder.
[He is] someone who
in two other universities did a remark-
able job of establishing programs that
were of, high quality and attractive to
students,” Nordenberg said.
“Obviously, those experiences and tal-
ents will be most directly applied here,
but we most certainly intend to take
advantage of him,” the chancellor
added‘.

study through the University Honors
College to work on the second
movement.

Novotny’s unique story line to
accompany his composition begins
with a happy family out for a drive.
They come across a circus tent and
go inside. This is where the story and
the music start to sound dissonant
and evil. -

Clowns in the circus tent start
throwing acid cream pies at the fam-
ily.

“The rest of the suite is abnor-
mal,” said Novotny.

Also a philosophy major, his
background in philosophy helped
him incorporate social matters into
the suite. For example, the little girl
who was once so happily portrayed
as a perfect little girl eats silicon gel
and, through ﬂashbacks and halluci-
nations, -reveals something not so
perfect about her past — her mother
abusing her and even burning her
with a cigarette.

The whole suite, which is in
four parts —— three of which will be
perfonned on April 5 — combines
the worlds of normal and abnormal
to make a social statement, said
Novotny. The statement is that
things aren’t always what they seem.

“I’m pleased with the way the
piece has come together,” noted
Novotny.

position combines the styles of some

of his favorite composers: Richard
Wagner, a German composer who
used emotion and tonality in his
music; Alfred Schnittke, a Russian
composer who wrote his music with
a “weird sense of humor”; and
Giancinto Scelsi, an Italian compos-
er who bent pitches and played out-
of-tune notes to create certain feel-
ings in his audience.

Novotny fashions his music
after these odd styles, believing that
manipulating sounds and using
experiences that people can relate to
are the best ways to get through to
listeners. _

“Mozart took something old and
made it, really interesting,” said

Novotny. “'I'hat’s why people liked
it.” . °

Lately, in between his classes as

a senior with a double major and
double minor, tutoring other stu-
dents, and applying to graduate
schools, Novotny has been ﬁnishing
the third movement of “Circus.”
Right now he averages three hours
of composing a day, but he still
wishes there was more time in the
day for writing music.

“I ﬁnd myself ﬁlling every

moment of the day with some kind
of work,” said Novotny.

accomplishments or personality are
unique, The Pitt News wants the

Free press is meant
to aid the people

The founders of this country ratiﬁed several amend-
ments to the Constitution they felt were imperative to
guarantee that democracy would be successful. One of
those amendments promised citizens unabridged free-
dom of speech and freedom of the press. ’

The Supreme Court has ruled time and again that
prior restraint is the worst evil that our Constitution's
framers wished to prevent. Unless it creates a clear and
present danger to people's lives -—- like shouting "Fire!"
in a crowded theater — speech and the press carmot be
censored by the government.

To the right of this editorial is an opinions column
about a Pennsylvania law that censors certain content
from student publications. Though the law seems to be
based on a noble idea, it runs exactly counter to the
ideals our founding fathers held so dear.

This law allows the Pennsylvania Liquor Control
Board to censor publications by removing their access
to information. It effectively threatens anybody who
would provide a student publication with free inforrna—
tion that anybody can obtain but that the state doesn't
want student newspapers to publish.

This form of prior restraint may be indirect, but it is
still a violation of constitutional rights. .

Newspapers must be allowed to publish informa-
tion that will help people to live their lives. Whether
that information compares the costs of education,
books, clothes or beer, it is information that people can
use, and it is information that people want.

And if a law is good enough to protect The New
York Times, then it must also be good enough to protect
every other newspaper, including those run by aspiring
young journalists still on their way up.

Any abridgment of that right, if it is allowed, sets a
precedent for another. If advertisements of drink spe-
cials at local bars are banned now, then advertising food
at those bars may be next.

In fact, several of the stories this newspaper ran this
year could be considered illegal if this law is taken to its
extreme —— stories that do give readers useful and
important information and that absolutely do not pre-
sent a clear and present danger: The Attic was listed in
Playboy as one of America's top 100 college bars; the

Beehive's upstairs will be changing from a coffee bar to ’

a real bar; and poetry readings are upcoming at Fuel
and Fuddle.

Freedom of the press is not so much a right of news-
papers as it is a right of the public, to guarantee that
information will not be hidden from the people.

At least, that's how things are supposed to work.

Pennsylvania law im inges 
on Constitutional rig is

Anthony Breznacan

Editor In chief

I’ve heard college stu-
dents like to drink beverages
that contain alcohol.

Some Pennsylvania law-
makers have also heard this,
and they must think this
drinking is a scourge to have
concocted a piece of legisla-
tion called Act 199.

The state feared that
underage college students
werekdrinking alcohol, so it
came up with this law, which
declared that no advertise-
ments for beer, wine or any
other alcoholic products can
appear in a publication that is
published “by, for, or in
behalf of” any university.

This means no Absolut
vodka ads in the football pro-
gram.

This means no listings of
drink specials in student
newspapers.

This means the state is
telling you what you can read
and write.

This is very important for
people to remember: Without
a free press, it is impossible
to understand the actions of
the government, community
and individuals in a democ-
racy. .

A free society without an
informed public is a lie, and
this law is a step in that
direction.

First of all, the state has
already passed laws against

underage drinking. With Act
199, legislators are essential-
ly saying that they know peo-
ple will break that law. They
must also believe that bar
owners violate the law by not
checking the identification of
young patrons.

While some underage
students are breaking the law
by drinking, and some bar
owners do not check IDs as
often as they should, the state

-does not have the right to

assume that everyone will
break the law just because an
advertisement entices them.

That’s like banning the
sale of candy bars because
kids will probably try to steal
them. And I thought people
were innocent until proven
guilty.

Guess it doesn’t apply to
all situations.

It’s interesting to note
that of the undergraduates at
Pitt, 50 percent are over 21.
Of all students at Pitt, more
than 60 percent are over 21,
and this figure doesn’t
i_nclude the University’s fac-
ulty and staff.

It infuriates me to think
that the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania thinks it can
tell me what I can read or
write. It shouldiinfuriate you,
too.

This law not only censors

ers. You used to be able to

So where will it stop?

Pennsy1vania’s office of
Liquor Control Enforcement
began enforcing the law last
fall by fining bar owners who
advertised in student news-
papers. Dozens of tavern
owners across the state cow-

sands of dollars in fines
against them. The crime?

so poorly written it’s silly.”

But none of Pennsylvania’s
school newspapers has the money to
pay legal fees.

One editor chose instead to
oppose the law in print, and that’s
when the state went one step too far.

Megan Donley, editor in chief of
The Daily Collegian at Pennsylvania
State University,_ began publishing a
news column called “Over 21
Scene.” The column included infor-
mation such as drink specials and
happy hour schedules, all of which

are illegal under Act 199 if part of a

paid advertisement.
But Donley did not accept
money for “Over 21 Scene.” She
simply provided information about a
legal product to the newspaper’s
many readers. .
Though the law explicitly states
that only liquor advertisements are
illegal, the state considers the‘
unpaid listings a violation of Act
199.

So LCE officers censored the

column by threatening to fine bar
owners or to suspend their liquor
licenses if the owners told The Daily
Collegian about their alcohol prices.

Bar owners refused to cooperate
with Donley, and she stopped print-
ing the report.

Thus the government has effec-
tively decided the content of an
independent newspaper.

Many college editors are now
afraid to even mention the law in
print for fear that advertisers will
disappear'foreve'r if the LCE contin-
ues to threaten them. The LCE’s
arbitrary interpretation of this law
could allow it to justify fining liquor

-licensees for advertising only food

specials or entertainment.

The loss of that revenue would
devastate many of these newspapers.

The state’s intention of curbing
underage drinking is commendable,
but its attempt to censor newspapers
is misguided and its methods of
threatening tavern owners‘ liveli-
hoods border on state terrorism.

Vryburg — where the spirit of apartheid remains

James Maude
columnlst

Vryburg, in the rural North—West
Province of South Africa, is the scene of
some recent violent tension between
black and. white pupils at Vryburg
Hoerskool (Vryburg High School).

The situation has escalated, with
black parents and white parents at each
other's throats, minor rioting occurring in
the Vryburg town center, and an incident
where a white policeman got involved in
a fistﬁght with a black fellow officer.

The government has officially
closed down Vryburg High for the two
weeks preceding the three-week spring
vacation, and has sent a government task
force to administer the school for the
next three months, and appoint a new
school governing board. That decision
was reached by Education Minister

L  Zacharia Tolo after North—West Province

Deputy Director General Abe Seakamela
deemed Vryburg High's governing board
(all but one member was white) too
incompetent to continue its administra-
tion and suggested that changes were
needed to prevent violent outbreaks from
occurring in the future. .

The problem started when white
pupils (mostly Afrikaners with an
extreme right—wing leaning) beat up
some black pupils, and a few weeks ago,
after Vryburg High Principal Theo
Schultz overlooked these incidents for
the umpteenth time, black parents began
to notice something very odd in Schultz's
decision to pass over punishment of
those responsible. (The talk soon reached

the South Africa Democratic Teachers
Union and the Congress of South
African Students, and a 2,500-person
rally was held in the neighboring black
township of Huhudi. Numerous rallies
were held in Vryburg, and the situation
began to look tense and confrontational.

This is not the first time this has hap-
pened in South Africa since the African
National Congress came to power. Other
areas have had problems of this sort,
including Potgietersrus and Kroonstad,
both rural white
towns. Even uni-
versities . have
been hit hard by
racial clashes,
especially the
University of the
Viritwatersrand in
Johannesburg
and Rand
A f r i k a a n s
University. in
Pretoria.

One of the
biggest problems
in the
postapartheid
South African
education system
is that while the '
former white schools have been opened
up to all, an irritating yet small contin-
gent of white administrators, teachers
and parents are not too happy about this
and, in some cases, have intimidated the
black pupils or manipulated their chil-
dren into doing it themselves.

. A whit¢ Parent. was quoted inlast

He said

Friday's J oharmesburg Star newspaper as
saying, "These dumb kafﬁrs just don't

want to learn. They come to school just.

to cause trouble."

Clearly, when comments like that
are being made, one can see that the
problem does not lie with black students
not wanting to learn. Besides, the asser-
tion that pupils are going to school not to
learn is a rather ridiculous one, especial-
ly considering that in South Africa while
it is compulsory for under-16s to go to
school, it's a law that is
not strictly enforced.

Another par-
ent, who was actually
held back by a police
officer because hetried
to lunge at a black pupil
with a stick, called
most black pupils
"unruly troublemakers
who ruin it for every-
one else."

While racial
integration is often a
long and difficult
process, it does not help
that a large number of
white people in
Vryburg, the South
African equivalent of a
one-horse southern U.S. hick town, have
this kind of attitude, which makes recon-
ciliation an even more arduous endeavor.
Even small reactionary fringe organiza-
tions can prove to be a massive migraine
on this process.

Another problem is that black pupils
are being absorbed into these schools

>Q'r§3a'v«'I-is‘;-'-L3;--.3;-’I'.s‘.£

an ii"-'a’i«An'v'rn'§p"ié

while having had an inferior education
beforehand in a derelict township school
(which was the intention of the apartheid
government's education policy), but no
extra help is being afforded them.
Universities offer a one-year session for
black high school graduates to prepare
them for tertiary education, but no such
thing exists for secondary schools such
as Vryburg High to help ease the transi-
tion.

The only concession made by the
former Afrikaans-language school was
to divide its curriculum into two tracks:

one taught in Afrikaans and one taught in

English. But this effectively guarantees
that the white students keep to them-
selves, as most blacks speak English as
their second language. While groups cer-
tainly have the right to retain their own
language and culture, at Vryburg High
and some other rural schools, this affords
these groups the opportunity to have a
microcosm on the school grounds struc-
tured in the spirit of apartheid.

But as seen at Vryburg High, some
people just don't seem to be able to ditch
their past prejudices. There is an air of
white supremacy that still looms over
these rural towns, and as seen in this
case, it's proving to be a foul stench.

The South African government task
force needs to create an atmosphere con-
ducive to learning at Vryburg High, not
conducive to bullying, racism and segre-
gationalist education.

Sewer lines and nuclear waste: a story of local politics

Kevin Lilley

Sports Edltor

There are some things that just
don’t deserve to be worth college cred-
it.

Anyone who has ever sat in the
back row. of an Introduction to
Astronomy for non-majors lecture
(“Now, if you look closely at the dia-
gram, you can see that the earth
revolves around the sun. ...”) knows
what I’m talking about. A

If you’re a political science major
taking basic-level American
Government (“Multiple choice: Which
is not a branch of the government? a.
Executive, b. Judicial, c. Legislative, d.
Kenneth Starr’s office”), then I’m
preaching to the choir.-

These things don’t deserve college
credit because most students have
already been tested on the subjects —
in ﬁfth grade. But there is another rea-
son why something shouldn’t deserve
credit — because it’s too interesting.

My example of this phenomenon
involves the Institute for Politics intern-
ship program and‘ nuclear radiation.

Gee, that choir got quiet awfully
quickly. . ~

Last semester, when I wasn’t busy
sacriﬁcing sports writers to the football
gods so that Pitt would make the
Liberty Bowl, I worked in a state sena-

tor’s ofﬁce. On my ﬁrst day in the state
senator’s ofﬁce, I received my ﬁrst pro-
ject: writing a letter to the mayor of
Pittsburgh, asking him to review a doc-
ument sent to our office by a con-
stituent.

The constituent, a civic-minded
gent, wanted to solve the city’s waste
problem by irradiating the sewer lines,
thereby killing all of those nasty organ-
isms that could possibly ﬁlter their way
into a river in unhealthy quantities if
there was a problem with the city’s sep-
tic system.

In layman’s terms, he wanted to
nuke the crap out of, well, crap.

I read this six-page pamphlet cover
to cover, from the half-page description
of tearing up city streets and embed-
ding radioactive materials beneath
them to the four—plus pages dedicated to
restating, over and over, “It’s safe! It’s
safe! Trust me!”

My mission was twofold. First, get
the mayor to read this and send the con-
stituent a letter acknowledging that
fact.

A Second, make sure the mayor real-
ized that my state senator would sooner
enter a three-legged race with Larry
Dunn than actively support tearing up
Pittsburgh’s streets to implant lead-
coated boxes of nuclear waste.

So, being accomplished at turning
something negative into something

readable (I’d covered Pitt football dur-
ing the second Johnny Majors era; radi-
ation and sewers have nothing on the
1996 Pitt Panther offensive game plan),
I did my job.

And as a bonus, I got to tell the
entire seminar class about it the next
week. My story ﬁt right in with ﬁelding
calls from senile senior citizens, eating
lunch with U.S. senators, and going
door-knocking with Rep. Don Walko.

Okay, so mine wasn’t the strangest
story. But the stories got better. Later in
the term, I spent three days in
Harrisburg with the senator and his
capitol staff.

Sounds boring, right? Well, it was.
During the day.

At night, the office’s Duquesne
intern and I got to hit the town with lob-
byists (who, despite rumors, do not pay
for everything), hear position state-
ments by inebriated ex-senators (who,
consistent with rumors, pay for noth-
ing) and sit outside a convenience store
in a locked van at midnight while an
elected ofﬁcial made his nightly salted-
snack run.

Oh, while he did that, two gentle-
men next to the van also made a trans-
action — ﬁve minutes away from the
capitol dome, they traded what
appeared to be a bag of something for
what appeared to be a small sum of
paper money.

Long live the war on drugs!

After this whole thing was ..over, the
institute gave me four credits.

Four credits for observing (and par-
ticipating in) the absurdity of politics.
And, every so often, helping a needy
constituent, writing a letter to an aspir-

ing politician who is in third grade, or ’

attending a committee meeting.

If your curiosity is piqued (or you
need four credits to graduate, or what-
ever) the institute will offer you the
same deal. Sign up.

If you’re lucky, you could get

“hands-on experience in any level of

politics. Work alongside Councilman
Dan Onorato as he continues to avoid
questions about running for mayor.
Work alongside State Sen. Jay Costa Jr.
as he continues to avoid questions
about running for county executive, if
such a position gets created.

Work alongside Rep. Don Walko
and learn how he personally led the
successful crusade against the half-cent
sales tax increase all alone without any
help from anybody else ever, ever, ever.

These names and more are all part
of the program. And, if you’re really
lucky, you can study irradiating the
city’s sewer system.

Ah, politics.

Pitt softball drops first two games

Alicea Crosby

Jen Mannick of the Pitt softball team
made history yesterday.

In the bottom of the ﬁfth inning with
one out, she connected for Pitt’s ﬁrst-ever
base hit, a single on the ﬁrst base side ofthe
makeshift Pitt Stadium inﬁeld.

Unfortunately, it would be Pitt’s last hit _

of the game.

The Panther softball team dropped its
ﬁrst-ever game last night — the ﬁrst game
of its doubleheader against St. Francis +— 4-
0. In the second game Pitt scored its ﬁrst-
everruninthebottomofthefolnthinning
but lost again, 11-1.

“I think we made some costly mis-
takes, but I still think we did a good job,”
said Head Coach Michelle Phelan. “I was
very pleased.”

Game-one starting pitcher Laura
IeV1ere felt conﬁdent before the game, she
said, because she had previous college
experience at West Virginia Wesleyan, but

Brown homers in 14-4 destruction of Dukes

Matt Mento
Staff Wrlter

A second-inning surge, followed
by a ﬁve-run outburst in the eighth
inning, cemented the Pitt baseball
tearn’s ﬁfth victory of the season yes-
terday, a 14-4 stomping of intracity
rival Duquesne.

The Panthers took a quick three-
run lead in the second inning as des-
ignated hitter Bill Brown led off with
a frozen rope into the right-center
gap for a double. One batter later,
first baseman Steve Dickinson
banged in the ﬁrst run of the game
with a single into left ﬁeld.

After a single by catcher David
Hoopes, second baseman Charles
Stafford ripped an RBI single to
right, scoring two runs for Pitt to give
it a 3-0 lead.

Duquesne fought back with two
_nms in the bottom half of the second,

including a solo homer by inﬁelder
Wﬂl Swisher off Panther starting

pitcher Eric Rosing. In the bottom of
the third, the Dukes tied the score
with an RBI double from ouﬁelder
B.J. Barnes before Rosing fought his
way out of the jam.

In the bottom of the ﬁfth, Kevin
Lazeski relieved Rosing after he
yielded a Barnes triple off the right
ﬁeld wall. Lazeski immediately gave
up an RBI single to outﬁelder Rocky
Kravetz, but retired the next hitter to
close the inning.

Pittsburgh retaliated, as the team
exploded for three runs in the sixth.

Bill Brown smashed a 370-foot,
two-run homer over the right-ﬁeld
wall to spark the rally. A walk by
Dickinson and a single to left by left
ﬁelder Chris Delsignore followed.

Panther Head Coach Joe
Jordano called for a double steal to
move both runners into scoring posi-
tion. The call paid off — a successful
steal and a ﬁelder’s choice later, the .
Panthers had a 6-4 lead.

At any given moment at an average
Pitt track and ﬁeld practice, a few athletes
can be found circling the track. Most of
the rest will be milling around, catching
their breath, and shouting encouragement
to their teammates on the track.

Pitt Junior Trecia Smith will proba-
bly not be among the shouters.

Her businesslike demeanor does not
lend itself to such vocal displays.
Besides, Smith has enough work of her
own to do.

A practical attitude is a necessity to
do what Smith does. She competes in
more athletic events in one weekend than

to mention the pentathlon (a ﬁve—event
indoor contest) and the heptathlon (a
seven-event outdoor contest), which are
combinations of jumping, running, and
throwing events.

Smith is a nine—time All-American
and a four—time national champion. Last
outdoor season, she set an NCAA record
in the triple jump. She owns or shares
over half a dozen Pitt school records.

All of this, and her collegiate career
is barely half over. Only a junior, Smith
has the upcoming outdoor season as well
as next year’s indoor and outdoor carn-
paigns to add to her already substantial
resume.

It was last year, in her sophomore

season, that Smith established herself as

my senior year, I’ll have one.”

The physical demands of competing
in, say, four events inone day are impos-
ing enough. The last thing an athlete
needs is for the mental weight to become
unbearable as well. To keep her sanity,
Smith shies away from comparing
events, seeing each one separately
instead.

“For me, each event is new. Before
the start of everything, I see myself doing
each event at a separate time. When I
leave one, that event is over.

“No matter what I did, that event is
behind me. Every time I approach an
event, I don’t see anything else but that
event,” Smith said.

Smith and her
coaches.

“I had a very long season last year. I
had competition up until August. This
year, we decided that if I’m going to have
another successful season, I need to take
a break,” Smith said.

For that reason, Smith did not com-
pete in her best events, the jumps, for
most of the 1998 indoor season. But Pitt
Head Coach Steve Lewis didn’t want his
star sitting at home either. So, this year,
Smith has competed in other events, par-
ticularly the shot put, in which she has
shown marked improvement over the
course of the season.

The shot put was a new challenge for
Smith, but it was a challenge she was
ready for.

“I know that if I concentrate on the
shot, I could be among the best,” Smith
said.

Smith probably didn’t realize how

put at the Frank Sevigne Husker
Invitational in early February because the
competition was just too good, Smith
came back a month later to win the shot
put at the ECAC regional championship
meet, throwing a distance of more than
48 feet — by far her best ever.

That doesn’t necessarily mean this
has been an easy season for her. Like any
athlete, Smith is driven by a desire “to be
the best,” as she says.

Being the best is difficult when
you’re not competing in your best events.
But Lewis managed to convince Smith
that she needed a rest more than she
needed to prove that she is the best.

“Coach Lewis has a way of making
me see things. And I could see where he
was right,” Smith said. “I’m just grateful
I had the patience to wait.”

That patience paid off. Smith recent-
ly won the 1998 NCAA
indoor championship in   ”
not one, but two events. '
She successfully defend-
ed her 1997 indoor long-
jump title, and also added .3
a win in the triple jump, ‘
winning by over a foot and
a half with what Lewis
called “two of the greatest
collegiate triple jumps I’ve
ever seen in my life.”

Smith hails from 
Kingston, Jamaica. You '9
don’t get recruited from
that far away if you’re .
not good, and Smith
was good. But she
quickly got her first 
lesson in patience
and humility, cour-
tesy of another
great Pitt athlete
from abroad,
N a j u In a
F 1 etc h e r ,
currently
on Pitt’s
coaching V
staff.

  
  
 
   
  
   
  
  
 
   
   
 
 
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 

“The ﬁrst thing I learned was to be
patient,” Smith said. “I came in as a 21-
foot [long] jumper, and Najuma would
beat me every single time. I couldn’t ﬁg-
ure it out. This was a new experience for
me.”

Besides teaching her a lesson, com-
peting with Fletcher made Smith a better
athlete.

“It was fun competing with her. We
pushed each other. I didn’t have to worry
about going into meets saying there are
other people better than me, because I
had the best person right here at Pitt,”
Smith said. '

That fact may have helped Smith
make her decision to come to Pitt, but the
deciding factor was Pitt’s academic repu-
tation.

“I wanted the best of both worlds,”
Smith said. “I wanted an area where I
could concentrate on track and do the
things I like, but I also wanted the acade-
mic side of it. I ﬁgured once I have my
degree [in sports medicine], track is just
for fun.”

Well, maybe not just for fun. There is

: the small matter of the summer

Olympics — only the world’s
biggest track meet —- to be dealt
with.
Track and ﬁeld athletes
dream about Olympic gold
medals the way Little
Leaguers fantasize about
hitting the home run that
wins the World Series.
For Smith, Olympic
hopes are more than a
pipe dream; they’re an
expectation.
“I see myself
right there in Sydney

if everything goes as
planned.”

When Pitt softball pitcher Laura
LeViere stepped onto the mound last
night, she was not alone.

Off in the stands, several clusters
of people —- totaling more than 40
individuals — chirped cheers, waved
signs and watched intently as she
stepped though her motions.

Some were friends, and some were
relatives, but everyone was like family
to LeViere.

Sitting on a second-row bleacher
wearing a bright yellow jacket and
waving a sign reading “‘K’ some A,”
13-year-old Kari Steigerwald cheered
LeViere on. Steigerwald, a pitcher on
the Pittsburgh Spirit —- a local team
that draws its players from among the
best in the Pittsburgh area — has been
coached by LeViere for over a year.

Nineteen-year-old LeViere has
worked with the Spirit for several years
and also currently coaches with her
father, Rich, at Northgate' High School.

Steigerwald said LeViere works
with her by catching for her in a local
gym, demonstrating the proper pitch-
ing motion and explaining to her how
to place a pitch without using technical
terms and raising her voice.

Seated beside Kari, her mother
Michelle Steigerwald said she watches
her daughter’s practices sometimes and

agreed with Kari’s assessment of
LeViere.

“[LeViere’s] not a guy yelling,”
Michelle said, adding that she feels
LeViere is “I00 percent dedicated to
the game” and has helped her daughter
immensely. LeViere’s “kind of a quiet
girl  but she’s personable. She doesn’t
talk about what she can do.”

Two rows back, next to a group of
girls holding a sign reading “Go
Linky” (LeViere’s high school nick-
name) and wearing a menagerie of high
school letterrnan jackets, sat Mark
Valeriano. His daughter Nataly is
another of LeViere’s players and the
top pitcher for the Spirit’s 12-and-
under age—division team.

“Laura is probably a cross between
being someone’s best friend and being
their mother,” he said. “[Her fans] are
here because of what Laura is to these
girls.” ,

Nataly said LeViere “isn’t like any
other coach I’ve ever had.” She said
LeViere will go to the practice mound
with her and — in slow motion —
show how to give a particular spin or
snap to the ball. Other days, LeViere
will knock balls out to her to work on
ﬁelding techniques.

With her left foot arched up on her
toes like a ballerina and her right foot
planted squarely against the pitching
rubber, LeViere received her signals
from catcher Cheryl Boehm in Pitt’s

ﬁrst-ever game last night. After she
whipped through her pitches, she
pulled through with six strikeouts (one
being the team’s first ever) and gave up
only seven hits. Pitt still lost the game,
4-0, to the St. Francis Red Flash.

Pitt Head Coach Michelle Phelan
said LeViere “pitched a great game.
She did everything we wanted her to.
We just need some hits to back her up.”

On the ﬁeld, the sophomore played
the same role that she coaches her play-
ers to live. Whether offering a quick pat
on the back to second baseman
Brittany Yoder after Yoder caught a
pop-up near the mound or leading the
cheering on the bench, LeViere was the
epitome of the team player in the eyes
of her comrades.

Her support “really pulled us
through the difﬁcult innings,” said left
ﬁelder Katie Fischer. ,

In Section 14 — 23 rows up from
the ﬁeld where he could watch the
movement of his daughter’s pitches --
sat father Rich LeViere and Laura’s
mother and grandmother. After each
pitch, he bent his head down and
marked the result on a yellow legal pad
mounted on his clipboard.

“She’s a little nervous,” he said.

Judging from Laura’s fan’s and
farnily’s shouting and jumping last
night, everybody was a little nervous.
But they were there to support for their

Shortstop Lou Melucci took advan-
tage of Duquesne’s pitching by ripping an
RBI single up the middle in the seventh,
scoring Stafford and giving Pitt a three-
run lead.

In the top half of the eighth,
Duquesne reliever Matt McMurm walked
the ﬁrst two batters he faced and hit the
third, loading the bases.

Freshman Brian Lowder then
relieved McNurm. The new Duquesne
hurler struck out Stafford but beaned cen-
ter ﬁelder Kevin Foley, scoring
Dickinson.

Melucci slapped an RBI single to left,
scoring Hoopes and Delsignore. Bill
Brown then completed his 4 for 5 after-
noon with a two-RBI single to right ﬁeld,
giving the Panthers a nine-rim lead.

In the ninth, Pitt added to the mas-
sacre with a run—scoring sacriﬁce ﬂy by

Stafford, scoring Dickinson for his third -

rim of the afternoon.

“I was very pleased with our offen-
sive performance,” Jordano said. “They
kept battling back, and they responded
well.” A .

The team will face a three-game
series against Big East rival Rutgers
University this weekend in New Jersey.

“Rutgers is a strong team. We will
need to play at the top of our game and
focus on the little things,” said Jordano.

The Panthers’ victory improved their
record to 5-7 overall and 1-1 in the Big
East.

F OLLOW/ING TIMES:

Staff Writer

The typical college freshman usual-
ly worries about what he will do on
Friday night. Devin Meece doesn’t have
to worry.

He already has his ticket punched
for Auburn, Ala., where the NCAA swirn-
ming championships will be held today
through Saturday.

The freshman Panther swimmer
competes for two gold medals in the 100-
yard and 200-yard breaststroke this week-
end at a meet said to be the fastest in the
world — even faster than the Olympics.

. Meece goes into, the NCAAS ranked
sixth in the 100-yard breaststroke and
18th in the 200-yard breaststroke. He is
among four seniors and one other fresh-
man in the top six.

The breaststroke is traditionally
known to be an older man’s event in
which the older one gets, the faster one
will become. If this phenomenon holds
true, who knows how fast Meece will be
by the time he is a senior.

Meece is optimistic about this week-
end’s championships, but kept the whole
experience in perspective.

“The two races are so wide open,”
Meece said. “All I can guarantee is that
I’ll swim faster than I have ever before.”

According to Meece, his best and
most comfortable event would be the
100-yard breaststroke, but according to
his coach, Chuck Knoles, he may surprise
himself in the 200-yard.

  swimming championships

Although only a freshman, Meece’s
lack of experience could be an advantage
at the meet, according to Knoles.

“He might be nervous in the begin-
ning, but being a little naive will be an
asset to  Knoles said. “Devin’s
experience with loud crowd noise from
football [Meece was an all-state gridiron
star in high school] will also make it eas-
ier for him.”

As Meece’s K coach, Knoles has
painted a picture for the rookie on how
the event operates, attempting to keep his
mind focused and keep the pressure
away. ’

Meece has focused on not allowing
himself to get caught up in the success of
this season. According to the swimmer,
there will be plenty of time next week to
reflect on his freshman season.

“I have a job to do this weekend,”
Meece said. “I want to push it to another
level and put my best effort fo .”

The only possible disadvantage
Meece may face is that none of his team-
mates will accompany him to Alabama.

Meece has said in the past that he
“zones” everyone out in preparation for a
race, but he said it would be nice to have
his fellow swimmers cheer him on during
the races, according to Meece.

But he will have his coach, and his
coach is looking for a top performance.

“Even as a freshman, it wouldn’t be
odd if he could win one or both of the
events,” Knoles said. “Our goal is to
place in the top 16. That would make for
a great season.”

Depending on a tearn’s schedule and
performance, it could have a two-week lay-
off before the conference semiﬁnal game, a
hiatus that Steelers’ President Dan Rooney
thinks could seriously hurt a team with
momentum headed for the postseason.

Cleveland just sucks.

0 The New England Patriots got a steal
three years ago when they drafted a rela-
tively unproven, injury-prone junior named
Curtis Martin out of Pitt. Martin shocked
the league, winning Rookie of the Year hon-
ors and rushing for over 1,000 yards.

1 The next year he helped lead the Pats to
the Super Bowl, and last year he was on
pace for yet another 1,000-yard season
before injuries sidelined him for good.

Martin will be back in Foxboro
Stadium next year, but only once during the
regular season.

And he will be in a New York Jets uni-
form this time, running plays for Bill
Parcells — the most-hated man north of the

The final chapter: Knavish’s personal weight-culling crusade

Brian Knavish

Staff Writer

(In the ﬁnal part of a three—part
series, the author reveals his personal
experiences with weight cutting.)

Hearing horror stories about
wrestlers torturing their bodies to lose
weight made me curious. I did have
some experience with weight cutting as
a high school wrestler, but I was a 125-
pound rum and never came close to cut-
ting like college guys do. The most I
ever cut was eight pounds, and that was
over a gradual period of time.

I decided to lose 10 pounds in a
week over spring break.“ I plarmed on
doing it the right way — eating health-
fully with regular exercise. But if that

. didn’t shed the 10 pounds, I’d stop eat-

ing and start sweating off weight in a
rubber suit.

On the Thursday before break, I
weighed 145 pounds with 14.9 percent
body fat —— both normal for someone
my height (5-7). My ofﬁcial deadline to
lose the 10 pounds was the following
Thursday at 6 p.m.

Friday

Food — a bagel, apple, salad, two
bottles of juice

Exercise — three-mile run, 30 min-
utes on an exercise bike

Nothing against salads, but lettuce

Food — yogurt, salad, two bottles
of juice, one bowl of chicken soup

Exercise — played basketball for
an hour, three-mile run

I wasn’t too hungry until after I
played a game of basketballin the after-
noon. Afterward, my friends and I went

This was the only day I went above
my 1,500—calorie daily limit. Hey, I’m
human. I was out with friends and
around food all day — boy, I felt guilty
that night. After my nightly run, I
weighed 143, the same as when I woke
up, which made me realize just how
much I hated the cursed scale. Weight at
day’s end —— 143.

was sure I was close. The scale still read
137. I put the dripping plastic suit back
on, and finally, after another hour on the
bike, with sweat literally pouring off
me, I got down to 135.

I made two huge realizations while
doing this. First, I gained a new level of
respect for wrestlers because of the
incredible amount of discipline that cut-
ting weight takes. I was utterly drained
after my experience, which doesn’t
even compare to the things most college
grapplers do.

Second, it is easy to understand
why cutting weight the unhealthy way
is so tempting. I last four pounds in two
hours doing it the “wrong” way versus
six pounds in six days doing it the
“right” way.

LFROM QUACKS T 0 COLLEAGUES ?:
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES ON
I CHIROPRACTIC

Steven C. Martin, M.D.
Department of Medicine and
Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine
Jacobi Medical Center, the Bronx, N.Y.

Friday, March 27, 1998

People suffering from painful malfunctions widely seek relief from
chiropractic treatments whose scientiﬁc and professional oversight are
divorced from standard medical practice. Controversies about
reimbursement for these treatments in health care plans remain
perennial and hotly debated matters. There is even controversy within
the chiropractic community about the types of treatments that should be
offered. How did this situation arise? What is at stake for the future of
an integrated medical system? This week’s lecturer is an historian of
medicine who holds an M.D. from the Columbia University College of
Physicians and Surgeons. Do not miss this special visit to Pitt by a
scholar of these profound practical and theoretical challenges in our
medical practices.
