Orientation Editor

' In mid-August, South Af-
rican President P.W. Botha
, surprised many when he
A announced that little, if any-
thing,’ would change in his
stance toward the treatment
of blacks in the country. This
speech sparked even more
unrest and violence in the
“already troubled» nation. On
_the day of the speech, seven
people died in violent protest.
._The African National Con-
gress vowed to step up protest
and take the violence into the

most effective means -of express-
ing the board’s opposition to
apartheid, and such precipitate
action could impede genuine
progress for non-whites in South ,

But Milliones said, “This crap

 Students organizing

Pitt students Dougr Howell
and Pa_ul Nash, both members of
Pittsburghers Against Apar-5

I theid, have distributed a letter to

"key organizations on campus
requesting “support and partici-
pation in rectifying this grave

I “Itwill be a major rally with
different constituents at the uni-
versity officially endorsed by the
PAA,” Howell said.

According to Howell, a day of
protest has been tentatively set -

‘for Oct. 11. An official date will

be set after the first organiza-
tional meeting on Sept. 7.
Howell said that the university
currently has $38 million in indi-
rect investments with companies
doing business in South Africa.
Indirect investments include
those in which the university
invests in a" company which in
turn invests in another company. .
He‘ also said that he is not sure

Other student voices I
At Penn State, the Under-

graduate Student Government,

has scheduleda series of events
over a two-week period to
heighten student interest in the
fight against apartheid and the

« divestment issue.

According ~— to Pete Byrnes,
director of the US_G’s depart-
ment of international affairs,"the
board of trustees at Penn State is
delaying any decision on divest-
ment until a student survey being
conducted by the USG has been
completed, and tabulated.

He said the survey is being
done by telephone and, because
of the large ‘student population,
will take another month to
complete.’

Byrnes also said that Penn

State had invested $4.8 million

in: South Africa affiliated com-
panies and _ recentl-y added

another $1.8 million.
The Penn State series is being

funded by the USG and [several-
departments within the organi-

zation including the depart-
ments of international, political
and minority affairs. ’
Proxmire to speak

Speakers for the engagement
include’ Sen. William Proxmire
(D.-Wis.), who has co-
sponsored an anti-apartheid bill.
Throughout the two-week
period, there will be panel dis-
cussions; films and an explana-
tion of Penn State policy on
divestment by the vicepresident
of finance.

Byrnes said that though the
USG has had difficulty in‘ arous-

ing student interest in the past, ‘
he~is encouraged by the,events of A

last term. He pointed/to a protest
staged last term against apar-
theid -— one of only a handful
such demonstrations since the
demonstrations against the Viet-
nam War.

 attacks

 I ‘By’ Dan Bates

News Editor

 In recent years, many Pitt stu-
dents -have all but forgotten their
many sports team and extra curricu-
lar activities. Student moral seems
to have plunged, and apathy has
become commonplace.

This fall, Pitt's Student Govern-

* ment Board will attack student

apathy and step-up efforts. to boost
school spirit on campus. _

SGB President Luke Kluchko
said he sees the lack of school spirit
as an attitude problem, one that goes

5 even beyond apathy.

“It’s cynicism,” said Kluchko.
“It’s something I noticed when I
came here as a freshman. I came here
from a high school that we were.
really proud of. At football games,
we always cheered for the team, and
we always cheered for the band.
However, at my first. Pitt football

_ . game, the first thing I learned was to

throw bagels at the band."
Kluchko said the SGB wants to do
away with the bad attitude that has
been plaguing Pitt.. “We have to
come up with better ‘ways for stu-
dents, even commuters, to feel a part
of something,” he said. “It’s hard for
a lot of them to get involved, so we

‘ have to try and make it as "easy as

possible."

In an effort to directly involve stu-
dents in supporting football at Pitt,

  visiting associates to visit and

ings I between students and head
coach Foge Fazio to discuss past
games and future scouting reports.
Also, refreshments and prizes will be
offered.

“This should help bridge that gap
with ’ the students,” explained
Kluchko. “We want to change things
so that he [Foge Fazio] will be more
than just some guy we see on the
football field every week. We want
tobring him to the students and
make the students feel like a part of
something.”

The SGB is also attempting to
bring back the crowd-attracting
bonfires. Until 1978, the bonfires
were one of the largest and most
exciting pre-game pep rallies- on
campus, Kluchko said.

“There would be a bonﬁre, then
the band would get in a double-file,”
explained Kluchko. “Then they
would run, snake-wise, all through
the campus, and all the’ students
would follow. It was crazy.”

Kluchko said the SGB is negotiat-
ing, with the Golden Panthers to
organize the future bonfires. He
pointed out that the Golden Panth-
ers are very enthusiastic about.the
student ‘attraction.

“I think they are more enthusias-
tic than some of the students about
the bonfires,” Kluchko said.

Face painting is also on the
agenda this fall to promote school
spirit. However, specific plans have
not yet been made.

dents participated in the painting rit-
ual before the Pitt Panthers lost to
Oklahoma 42-0.

The idea was first introduced by
Generik Ink, Inc., a company that
produces body paints for use at Hal-
loween. They supplied the paint,
brushes, stencils and promotional
supplies, and Pitt was supposed to

supply the bodies, said company’

representative Lee Martin.

Despite the various activities
planned to boost school spirit, the
SGB is focusing most of its attention
toward the incoming freshman class.

Kluchko said he believes that the
student attitude problem at Pitt can
best be attacked at the freshman
level.

“We want to start with the fresh-
man class, and after we are done
developing their school spirit, we
will have to maintain it,” Kluchko
said. “Hopefully, that spirit will
carry over to the rest of the classes.”

'As part. of freshman ‘orientation

drumming up school spirit.

On September 3, Playfair will put
on a program for the freshmen
which will encourage constant inter-
action among students.

“We just want to get the freshmen
together and break down any barri-
ers so they can get out "and meet
people,” and Greg Cederlof, the
SGB’s coordinator of the event.

Playfair representative Barbara
Meyer described the event as a times
full of fun, games and “lots of laugh-
ter.” She said students will always be
doing things in groups throughout
the program, so they will never be
isolated. - ‘ ‘ _

Students, for example, will be
asked to participate in a “back-to-
back” dance, one in which students
will actually dance facing away from
their partners. “This is to en_able the
freshmen to mingle better with eve-
ryone else,” Meyer said.

“When students attend the usual
types of freshman mixers, they
become shy and uncomfortable, and
they‘ often head straight for the
door,” said Meyer. “We want to pre-

. vent that."

' One of the main goals of Playfair,
added Meyer, is to make the fresh-
men feel comfortable with others .
after they leave the program,-thus
leaving them with a healthy attitude
toward themselves and the
university.

News Editor

They move around the Pitt cam-
pus in droves, gazing in awe at the
Cathedral of Learning and the stu-
dent towers. They stop passers-by
on the street for directions to Hill'-
man Library. They are young and
confused. They are the incoming
freshmen.’

But why are they here? What
made them decide to attend Pitt?

“I really respect the rankings of
the philosophy and chemistry
departments and I’ve received a

scholarship to attend Pitt,” said-

Alaric Franzos, a tall, lanky fresh-
man carrying a pencil in one hand
and a bicycle wheel in the other.
“But let’s face it, I guess the final
reason was that my parents bought
me a Porsche to come to Pitt.”

Franzos was one of the incoming
freshmen who responded to a ran-
dom survey conducted recently by
The Pitt News in an attempt to dis-
cover why they chose Pitt as their
alma mater.

Seventeen-year-old Faith Neft
also fell victim to parental bribery in
her decision to attend Pitt.

‘“The only reason I am here is
because my parents decided to bribe

‘ me,” she said, openly and without

hesitation. “Instead of me going
away to college and spending a lot of
money, they said that if I will stay

home and‘ go to Pitt,’ I can ‘spend.a ‘

‘year in Europe. So, I’m going to

Pitt.” .
However, most of the surveyed

‘ freshmen did not encounter such

luxurious incentives. For most,
sports cars and European experienc-
es were simply out of the question.

It seems many of the incoming
freshmen based their choices on the
cost of tuition. According to the sur-
vey’s ﬁndings, almost 16 percent
chose Pitt because costs are rela-
tively inexpensive compared to

other colleges and universities

around the countrv. _
Location also seemed toplay a
key role in many decisions to attend

Pitt. More than 20 percent said they
wanted to stay “close to home.”And
as one freshmen put it, “The many
other universities are not five min-

' utes from my house.”

On the contrary, others have
sought refuge at Pitt to get away
from home. “I want to move to the
city,” said Dave Ditty, a freshman
from a rural community outside of
Harrisburg. “I don’t want to spend
my life in a cow pasture."

Eighteen-year-old Warren Silvers
is looking for independence. “I
wanted a place that was far away so I
.Wouldn’t always _be hounded by my
parents every single day.”

Of course, a majority of the fresh-
men surveyed claimed they selected
Pitt for its academic reputation.
Eighty-eight percent said they chose
Pitt because of its excellence in the
areas of medicine, biology, chemis-
try and physical therapy, as well as
in engineering and foreign relations.

While the findings of the survey
revealed a common desire for a qual-
ity education, they also pointed to a
common motivation behind the
desire -— the quest for successland,
of course, money. Freshman Mark
Hudak said he is attending Pitt
simply to obtain “the n‘ :cessary skills

 

men reveal truth   2        

to help me land a job that pays and

. pays and keeps on_paying." I ,
Robert Firth, coordinator of New

Student Programs at Pitt, said he
sees this motivation as a growing
trend among college students.‘

“These freshmen are a pretty
bright group," Firth explained, “but
like the rest of the country, they are
much more concerned with the
material rewards than the deep spirit
of intellectual understanding.”

However, 25 percent of the sur-
veyed students indeed indicated a
need to gain “intellectual under-
standing” at Pitt. They said they
hoped to broaden their views, their
horizons and their understanding of
society, life and the opposite sex.
One student just wantedxto grow up.

And then others merely wished to
broaden their social lives, meet peo-
ple and have a good time — sort of
an expensive party that goes on for
four years.

“I’m here for a good time." I’m
going to study, but I ’m certainly not
going to study like a scholar, that's
for sure,” said John Altrater, a fresh-
man from Beechview.’

Finally, one student admitted that .

his options were quite limited. “Out
of the five universities I applied to,

Pitt is the only one that accepted '

Placement c

for

-4

‘By Richard Touitellott
Staff Writer

“The student of today is not hav-
ing as much fun as the student of 10

I ‘ _ years ago,” said the director of Pitt’s

Placement Service, Robert
Hopkins. .
Hopkins’ professional experienc
with college students began in the
1960s. According to Hopkins, stu-
dents at that time began life in angera

’ of rapidly growing economy and

consequently .felt that wealth and
comfort were their birthright. Now,

. Hopkins said, “Students are much

less confident that they will be pro-

.V vided for.”

Hopkins said he believes that the
transformation from ﬂower child to
yuppie began in the mid 1970s.
“That's when I began to see students
who were strictly looking for
dollars.

“The young urban professional

‘ image is a kind of tragic myth. The

number of people who can really
afford all those status symbols _is
actually very small. We've con-
vi_nced people that these material
things are important. Consequently,
there are few students who feel that
they can afford to give free rein to
humanistic values.”

Hopkins lamented the idea that
students feel forced to study and
work in areas in which they have no
interest. “At the undergraduate
level, a student should major in a
field that he or she likes and feels
confident in," he said.

Hopkins pointed to the apparent
computer Levolution as one of the
factors inﬂuencing student choices.
It has caused enrollment in comput-
er science courses to triple in the last
decade. The result, according to
Hopkins, is that colleges and univer-
sities produce more computer spe-
cialists than the industry needs.
“The computer revolution has
been hyped. The myth is that com-

puters are taking over. A really good
computer programmer will always
find work, but for the average per-
son in that field, demand has

- dropped off,” Hopkins said.

“People, not specialists, use com-
puters. The trend is for all kinds of
employees to have more contact
with the computer. For example, at
McD_onald’s, in order to ring up a

“There are many things you can
do to ease your transition into the
business world," he said, adding that
students often have a narrow view of
the placement process and the types
of jobs for which they might be
qualified.

Hopkins admits that today’s stu-
dent gives grades an importance far
beyond their true value. “Grades are

“When students and administrators have

advice to students is to study what you want, but

it. The computerized cash register

can order, make -changes and keep -
- track of inventory. Most impor-

tantly, it doesn’t need to be operated
by a specialist. Anyone can do it,”
Hopkins said. ‘

“Computers are part of the
mechanics of the business world, not
necessarily the key to it,” Hopkins
said. He said that he believes that
computer skills are best allied with
some other discipline.

“People should know how to use
computers but also should have
other desirable skills in fields like
accounting, business administration
or health services," Hopkinssaid.
He said that a broad education is
still the ideal preparation. . '

“When students and administra-
tors have bought into the technical
model, it’s hard to get them to see the
value of a liberal education. My

"advice to students is, ‘Study what

you want, but don’t avoid practical
affairs.’

important, but grades alone don’t
guarantee success,” he said.

He often finds employers looking
for qualities in a prospective
employee that are not revealed by
his or her QPA. “Sometimes the stu-
dent with a 3.9 will have a harder
time getting hired than the student
with a 2.5,” he said.

Hopkins claims-that for many
employers, an applicant’s overall

experience, behavior and communi- ‘

cation skills are more important
than his or her transcript. “For cer-
tain positions, like sales jobs, I feel
there might even be a negative corre-
lation between high grades and the
ability to perform,” he said.
Students are often hesitant to
apply for some jobs because they feel
inadequate for them. Said Hopkins,
“The person actually hired may not
bear any: resemblance to the stipula-
tions of the employer. It's a ‘wish
list.’ Most hirings are com-
promises. Placement is not such a
neat science that what we see in a job.
candidate is what. an employer sees.

The university and the business
community are two different worlds
with different values,” he explained.

Hopkins sees the mission of the
placement service as helping stu-
dents to understand the business
community and easing them into it.
“We don’t deal with them until their
senior year. Before that, they get
advice from family, friends and aca-
demic advisers.

“Placement is a matter of readi-
ness. You can't get people involved
until they are ready to be involved.
My staff has more capabilities than
most of our clients use,” he said.

The services that Hopkins
referred to include videotapes of
mock interviews, help with resumes
and cover letters, tips on appearance
and developing communication
skills, a non—circulating library of
job information and a credential ser-
vice. The credential service enables a
person to keep letters of recommen-
dation on file at the placement office
indefinitely. ' _

“We have some files that go back
into the 1940s. One of the realities of
the present economic situation is
that we work with alumni who have
been laid off or forced into early
retirement. Some of these people are

‘ 55 and 60 years old. We don’t know

what the upper limit is on our servic-
es,” Hopkins said.

At the Placement Center, alumni
records are kept apart from those of
currently enrolled students. Alumni
also pay a $10 fee, twice that charged
current students. Hopkins finds that
a separate system for alumni guar-
antees that the greatest attention is
paid to seniors. _

Students who use the placement
service get as much help as they need
to become presentable to an
employer, said Pat Carr. Carr has
been with the placement service for
ﬁve years and is assistant to the
director. ‘ V

“The most common problem is
that students don’t know what is
important to an employer,” Carr

road education before job

said. Knowing what to communi-
cate to an employer to make yourself
appear desirable is an essential skill.

“Experience is not what happens
to you, it’s what you do with what
happens to you,” Carr said. She
added that there is a great deal of
anxiety among students about being
successful.

“Students don’t feel that there are '

things that they can do to make a
successful job search more likely.
We try to gauge what areas a student
needs to work on from the time the
student first comes in,” she said.
Carr advises students to looknot

only at academic work but also to be ' ‘

diligent about gaining other types of
experience. Community activities,
volunteer work and student govern-
ment are all excellent ways for an
undergraduate to gather valuable
experience. In Carr’s opinion, there
is no substitute for experience.

Communication skills are an
often-overlooked aspect of success-
ful job hunting, Carr said. .It’s not
uncommon to see cover letters that
begin with a sentence such as, “I
know I'm not the best person for the
job, but  she said.

The placement center helps stu-
dents overcome tendencies to down-
grade their ability. “One of the best
tests is to send them out t6 an
employer,” Carr said. ,

“We can also set up a mock inter-
view and videotape it,” she added.
By watching the tape, students
become aware of any weak points in
the way they present themselves.

Hopkins said the mood on cam-
pus today is slightly pessimistic.
“This. is the first generation that feels
they won’t have it as good as their
parents did.” he said.

Recessions and a sluggish econ-
omy, Hopkins notes," have forced
students to learn the hard lessons of
the post-industrial age. The place-
ment center is one avenue to explore
for help with the often difficult prob-

lem of adapting to the ever-changing ’ A

Pitt’s School of Medicine: Looking back 100yearsi

k CENTURY OP _

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer
And Dirk Kaufman

Orientation Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine is approaching
its 100th anniversary, and like most
centennials,the event will be marked
by a year of celebration.

In the fall of I886, however, there
was no talk of parties.

Prior to creation of a medical
school at Pitt, aspiring physicians in
the area had few options. Pittsburgh
was a latecomer to formalized medi-
cal education, and there was little
support from the community. Con-
sequently, students had to go to
Europe or travel to the East Coast
for medical training, or they could
apprentice themselves to a local phy-
sician. In the late 19th century, a
local medical school was the
unlikely dream of a’ few visionary
men.

In his inaugural address in 1822,
the Rev. Robert Bruce, first princi-
ﬂit“ of Western University of Penn-

' . sylvania, expressed his hope that the

university would establish its own
medical school by stating, “  a col-
lege of physicians and surgeons will
ere long .be eagerly looked for and
hailed as a very great benefit.”
However, physicians seeking “a
room for dissection” at that time

were rebuffed by the university, and‘

Bruce’s words became useless rheto--
ric. It wasn’t until 50 years later in

1871 that John Milton Duff — stu-
dent editor of the University Journal
—, wrote several editorials calling
attention to the prestige that the
school would accrue from such a
department. In 1885, a.stock com-
pany composed of 11 physicians
(including Duff) and an attorney
was created to establish a proprie-
tary institution to be known as the

Western Pennsylvania Medical

School.

  
 

 

 1985 PITT SCH MED

Humble beginnings

The schools first home was on .

Brereton Avenue in the city‘s Polish
Hill neighborhood, adjacent to the
Western Pennsylvania Hospital. It
opened its doors to 57 students that
fall. Housed in a five-story brick
building, the facility consisted of
two lecture rooms, a dissecting room
and chemical, pathological, histo-
logical
laboratories. _

Those first students graduated in
one year, ‘but the school soon
insisted on two years of study. There
were 21 graduates from the initial
group, with names like Elmer Brown
Boreland, Jeremiah ‘Johnston
Brewer and George Washington
Hatfield. Annual fees were set at
$100. [Yearly tuition now costs
$1 1,150 andthere are 128 students in
the current class.] ,

The first deanrof Western Penn-
sylvania Medical College was James
Bissett Murdoch, a prominent'sur-
geon educated at New York Univer-
sity’s College of Physicians and
Surgeons. When Murdoch died in
I897, academic standards began to
decline -severely. The policy of the-
new clean, J. Chris Lang, was to
increase enrollment while cutting

costs on equipment, facilities and -

laboratory maintenance. ‘Many of
the new students were admitted with

_almost no formal education. If

someone had the desire to go to
medical school and had $75, he or
she could._Students came from the
small towns and villages of western

and microscopical-

Pennsylvania, and several women
enrolled. .

Medical educationﬂwas costly to
provide and the school was losing
money. The stockholders, who had
had hopes of receiving some return
on their equity, were forced instead
to reach into their pockets to cover
the growing debt. Thus, in I907, a
closer association with Western Uni-
versity, the very institution that had
turned down the medical school ear-
lier, seemed desirable. -

The university itself was chang-
ing. In 1905, Samuel Black McCor-
mick accepted the position of
‘chancellor with the provision that
the university be unified within two
years and that all of its professional
departments be brought together in
one location. His goal was to turn
the professional schools into gradu-
ate ‘education centers, and the
medical school was central to his
plan. ,

McCormick said, “The day has
passed when aldetached medical col-
lege, organized for profit, can pre-
pare men to practice medicine.” As
soon as possible, he told the trustees,

“The university should assume full .

cont_rol of the medical and dental
schools.”

/ .

Assimilation and change

McCormick changedthe name of _ '

Western University to University of
Pittsburgh, purchased a steep tract
of land in the developing Oakland
area and commenced to assimilate
the medical school. Negotiations
were difficult but the school was
eventually bought for $100,000. its
physical assets — an aging building
and outmoded equipment — were

worthless, and its student body was

ill-prepared for graduate training.
All that remained was to fire the
officers and administrators of the
proprietary school, revamp the cur-
riculum to’ conform to modern
standards and move the school to
the university’s new campus.

-To« accomplish his program of

If so, attend the

sponsored

modernization, McCormick per-
suaded Thomas Shaw Arbuthnot, a
wealthy, Yale-educated physician,
to become dean. , .

Arbuthnot’s undertaking was
enormous ‘- the summer of 1909 he
hired new facuiiy, set higher stan-
dards of admission and performance
for the student body and prepared
himself to teach several courses.
Two years later Arbuthnot closed
the school to women. He instituted a
four—year curriculum with ‘the first
two devoted to pre-clinical training
in the basic sciences, and the remain-
ing years devoted to clinical
training.

By l9ll the school had been relo-
cated in newly-built Pennsylvania
Hall, which stood near the crest of

the university campus and was the

home to the medical school until the
current building — Alan Magee
Scaife Hall — was constructed in
I956. "

next I4 months, his staff was to pro-

vide treatment for nearly 20,000 _

patients.

Those who were left behind were "
engaged in the civilian war effort,-

and many cared for victims of the
deadly influenza epidemic of 1918.

’ Arbuthnot returned to the school in

l9l9, but no longer had an active
interest in its leadership. The school
still had no endowment, no financial
security and no hospital under its
charge. The medical school did not
control even a single hospital bed.

Dean Raleigh Russell Huggins

’ took officein 1919 and became the

force behind creation of the Univer-
sity Medical Center. The model for
such a center already existed at
Johns Hopkins Uniyersity. Huggins’

problem was to convince the admin- H

War takes its toll

Progress came to an abrupt halt
when the United States entered
World War ‘I. The war effort
severely depleted the school's ranks
and the faculty was asked to form a
hospital unit for medical service in

been commissioned, mostly from

the full-time faculty. Dean Arbuth-

A Attention freshmen.‘

Congratulations, you finally
made it to college. This marks
the beginning of what could
. potentially be the best four years
of your life. Whether they are or
not, of course, is up to you.

After spending some time try-
ing to think of some profound
advice to give to all of you, I can't
"help but feel envious. If I had the
chance to do it all over again, I
would. My freshman year,
though at times very frustrating,
was probably one of the most
exciting ones. For the first time I
had the freedom that I had
always wanted. At first, unfortu-
nately, I didn't use that freedom
to its fullest extent.

After finishing my first semes-
ter here I absolutely hated Pitt. I
remember telling my dad that
“Pitt is too big" and that “the
people aren't friendly."I imme-
diately wanted to transfer
because things ha'dn't turned out
the way I had planned. I had

Get involved!

spent my first semester just stud-
ying and worrying where my
next beer was coming from,
never attempting to get involved.
As a result I really didn't know
that many people here.
Fortunately, my dad con-
vinced me to stick it out. He
made me realize that Pitt was
only “too big” because I had
never made the effort to explore
the campus and that the “people
weren't friendly" only because I
never made the effort to get
involved and meet people.
Many of you may at times feel
the same way I did. All I can say
is hang in there and do your best
to get involved. Getting the most
out of college means “giving it all
you've got." If you take advan-
tage of your newfound freedom
and use it to its fullest extent
you’ll see for yourself that Pitt
really isn't that big and that the
people are really quite friendly.
Once you’ve made the step

towards getting involved, the
only other advice I can give to
you is to be objective. You will be
meeting all types of people from
different types of backgrounds
with different opinions than
yourself. Don't be so hasty to
judge them. Just approach these
new experiences with an open
mind. Keeping yourself open to
new ideas is one of the most
important aspects of the college
experience. '

In closing, I just want to add
that if you ever need any infor-
mation or advice concerning stu-
dent life here at Pitt, just give us a
call at Student Government.
That is what we are here for.

Again my congratulations and
I wish each and every one of you
the best. ‘

 Sincerely,
Luke 1. Kluchko
President, Student Government

  Whatever happened to Frank?  

I've "been thinking about a guy
named Frank Shaw. He's 21, about
6-2, and he has blue eyes that skitter

away from yours and ﬂit instead '

over your hair, your clothes and the
scenery over your shoulder. He has
curly black hair and a frequently

E K trimmed beard that makes him feel

safe and protects his heart from
being constantly on display.

Frank is a participant in a patient
re-integration program conducted
by the Carnegie-Mellon University
psychology department. People who
have been hospitalized a long time
have a smoother transition easing
back into the real world if they
“practice" meeting strangers by talk-
ing to ordinary people in an infor-
mal setting. I was the ordinary
person.

When I arrived for our appoint-

' ment, a graduate student led me to a

stark beige room. We sat down on
either side of a big wooden table that
had a dozen or so wind-up toys on
one corner. V

He told me I would be meeting
Frank, who had been in the hospital
for nearly a year with heart trouble,
and he explained that we would be
making up games with the wind-up
toys as a way of breaking the ice.
Before I met Frank, I would read a
self-profile he had written, and I
would answer a questionnaire
myself to give Frank some idea of
who I was.

I answered my questionnaire and
the grad student took it next door
for Frank to read while I read his

profile. I learned that Frank had
decided to study architecture, that

he liked people with a sense of’

humor, and that he learned a lot
about himself during his year at the
hospital.

It still wasn't time to meet Frank; I
had to answer another questionnaire
in response to what I had just read.

On a scale of one to 15, how would I
rate Frank's sense of humor? His
ability to communicate? -How lika-
ble was he? Did he seem suspicious?

Would I hire him for a job on the‘

basis of his profile?

I answered four pages of ques-
tions —— a bit much, I thought, for
someone I hadn't even met yet. The
student asked me to fetch the chair
in the corner for Frank, and then he
asked me a few more questions. Was
there anything I didn't understand?

Did I feel like any information was '

being withheld from me? “Well, no,"
I said. '

“Good,” he said. He paused.
“There is no Frank. This whole
situation has been contrived, and
what we're really trying to find out is

What they really were trying to
find out was something about
whether people look at other people
as individuals or members of groups
they've been given. For example,
some people are told Frank is a schi-
zophrenic patient. They're quicker
to lump him in a group and to decide
they don't like him and wouldn't hire
him. They're also less likely to place
Frank's chair near themselves.

My first reaction was relief: I
wouldn't have to play with those
wind-up toys.

But then I was disappointed; I was
looking forward to meeting Frank.

My younger brother, . about
Frank's age, is also an architecture
student. And I have a less-than-
perfect heart of my own. We would
have had things to talk about.

“How did our story hold up?" the .
grad student said. We talked about
other things ——-de-brieﬁng, he called
it, in which he explained why I had
done what I had just done — but the 1
part that fascinated me was how well
their story held up. -

It's odd. Frank became more real
for me after I found out he was ficti-
tious. I even found myself gesturing
toward his chair as if he were there.

I've been in a writing program
here for a year, making up stories
about what I thought were living,
breathing, real characters, and along

-— a place to recognize the people
who put this thing together. It may
not be there though, because I'd for-
gotten about the space on page four,
column ﬁve, reserved to hold the

very same thing. Look both places. i

If you see no staff ‘box, call me.
The interesting thing about all this
is that I am a student. In this case I

chology student and more three-
dimensional to me than any of my

own people. ~

I can see Frank now, skinny, a
little pale, wearing jeans and a cham-
bray shirt that keeps coming
untucked in back, with that endear-
ing way’ he has of bobbing up and.
down when he walks. He's always
looking up, at cupolas and cornices
and gables and window frames, and
sometimes you have-to speak to him
twice before he hears you. '

I felt cheated, not getting to talk to
Frank. I think we might have hit it_
off. I wonder about him —— if he's
ready -for school to start, if the
color’s coming back to his face, what
his eyes are like if he would let me
look at them for more tha a second.

I suppose I should thank that
CMU student. I gave him some data
to support his theory, but he taught
me something about creating fiction
by giving me Frank. The rest of
Frank's story is up to me.

am also the editor of the orientation

issue. How I prioritize these two
occupations is evident in both a low

sleep-to-consciousness ratio and an

even lower QPA.

See, my parents consider me to be
a student who happens to be an edi-
tor. I consider myself to be a writer
who happens to be an editor who
happens to be a student. What this
gives in terms of responsibilities and
my recognition of them is the right
to say, “I'll turn my story in when I
darn well please, thank you.” Not to
mention, “Of course I skipped class,
I'm the editor.” ‘

The sad thing is, _it doesn't work
that way. “It," of course, being life.
Specifically at Pitt. Hence my
ragged QPA and tired disposition.

The good thing is, I am happy. I
could have come to college, held
tight to my vision of a student, con-
sumed my share of alcohol each
night of the week, and turned my
shade of green the next morning.

Instead, I am writing this to you.

I have often heard it said to me
that I don't appreciate “how luckyl
am” to be here. This is probably
true. In response I must say that L
enjoy being here. I enjoy the fact that
I have the opportunity to work for
The Pitt News and stay up all night. I
appreciate and care a great deal
about the people I work with here.

What this means to you as a new

student is that you may choose to .

remain what you perceive a student
should be. Or, you may try to take
on whatever comes at you forwhat it
is: Don't worry about how lucky you
are. Take the opportunities here for
their basic worth, then mold them to
what you feel they will ‘help you
become. — '

The catch to living at Pitt is not to
talk about what you might like to
do. You've got to go out and take it.
No one here is going to give you
anything without extracting a price.
Be honest with yourself and take
what chances you feel are necessary.
It may mean skipping a class ortwo,
or staying up all night, which would
probably make your parents mad.

That's okay though. You'll be
happier, and they'll still love you, or
at least like you, anyway.

seeks freshman support

Black Action Society

Dear Freshmen:

We would like to extend a warm
welcome to you, the incoming fresh-
men class — the class of 1989. We
have adopted you as the class that
will bring" about a" renewed interest

_ in our fine ‘organization and at the

same time strengthen the black pres-
ence here at the University of Pitts-
burgh. To accomplish this gigantic
task, we have worked diligently
through the summer months, put-
ting the finishing touches on a broad
array of academic, political and
social programs which are geared to

- raise your “Black Consciousness.”

At the same time, we hope you will
use the knowledge acquired as sup-
port throughout your college career.

Our programs range from the
newly established tutorial workshop
to our always-spectacular Black
Week celebration, which is high-
lighted this year by Minister Louis
Farrakhan and the Honorable Wal-
ter Fauntroy (D-Washington D.C.).
-Also planned is the Get-Acquainted
Weekend, which encompasses the
Indaba — “Black on Black Racism,”
a dance and fun’-filled picnic.
History

It was 1969, and the forecast for I

the advancement of the black race
appeared bleak. The Quagmire the-

ory made it almost impossible not to
draft blacks at high rates into the
armed services at the time of the
Vietnam War. Three of the most
positively inﬂuential people to the
black race were assassinated: Mal-
colm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and
John Kennedy. _

' Locally, the Tri-M program
(Marcus, Malcolm and Martin, a
program established by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh), whose goal was
to recruit disadvantaged blacks into
Pitt, wasn’t effective. Black and
white relations at-Pitt were a new
entity. Animosity between the two
groups grew. The University of
Pittsburgh lacked programs signifi-
cant to the cultural and historical
enrichment of blacks (i.e., a black
studies program, entertainment),
the number of faculty and students
admitted to Pitt was unbearably
low, and there were no black
administrators.

These were just a few .problems
facing blacks in 1969. Something
had to be done. The Black Action
Society of the University of Pitts-
burgh — a young black radical
organization — was aware of the
problem. In fact, BAS tried several
times to meet with University offi-
cials to discuss the matter two years

What happens to

Reagan’s

WASHINGTON —.-1 write three
columns a week. They are almost

~ always on different subjects, and

they almost never refer to previous
columns. Three times a week, I sug-
gest that three different subjects are,
to exaggerate just a bit, the most
important issue in the world. Even I,
though, tip my hat to Ronald
Reagan. ,_

The president is a bit like me.
Once he was a movie actor, which
meant showing up every day to film
scenes that did not necessarily have
anything to do with one another.
You could shoot the end of the pic-
ture first and the beginning last. It
did not matter. Later, he went into
the business of writing newspaper
columns, radio speeches and, of
course, politics. He knows even bet-
ter than I do that what you say one
day does not necessarily have to

have anything to do with what you '

said the day before. M
Maybe this accounts for the dis-

connected feel of the Reagan admin-

istration. The other day, for
instance, the president went down to
the wire on aid to the Nicaraguan
contras. He lobbied on the phone; he
lobbied in person. He employed the
truth —— and something less than the
truth —— and implied that Western
civilization was at stake. He lost,
went on television and talked about
the budget.

I’m aware that he intended all
along to talk about the budget. Still,
there is something just plain weird
about not mentioning an event that
moments before had the entire capi-

tal on the edge of its chairs. Instead,«

it was as if Nicaragua was a
burlesque act and someone had gone
for the hook. Bring on the budget.
Lots of issues have been yanked
off the White House stage in this
manner. Remember Lebanon? It is
not even mentioned anymore. It
closed out of town. Once, it was
worth dying for — literally. Once, it
was all that stood between the Soviet
Union and San Diego; the impor-
tance of Lebanon was beyond dis-
pute. Now it is beyond the horizon.
The same thing happened to the
Middle East peace plan. It was
announced in a television speech,
pushed for a couple of weeks and"
"then abandoned, although the Mid-
dle East is still there and peace is not.
To be fair, the administration has
stuck to certain themes — an arms
buildup and a reduction in the size of
the government. And where it’s been
persistent, it’s been successful. But in
most ways, the administration’s con-
centration span mirrors the media-

zonked, country's. Issues go by like

issues?

boxcars in a freight train and not
because they are solved. But the
world refuses to conform to admin-
stration doctrine. Drug abuse will
hardly disappear because Florida
was assigned to Vice President
George Bush who, armed with a
press release and a wholly inade-
quate budget, was supposed to put
the Sunshine State in a drug-free
bubble. ’

Lebanon, too, had a‘ reality that
defied presidential rhetoric, and so
does Nicaragua. Calling the contras
the “moral equivalents of the
Founding Fathers " does not make
them so any more than referring to
Lebanon’s Amin Gemayel as a
national leader made him anything
more than a sectarian chieftain. The
words are disassociated from both
events and reality — as if_ simply
saying them, movie fashion, made
them true. —

Issues shoot across the Washing-
ton sky like shooting stars.
Remember discipline in the schools?
Oh, what an issue! The president
himself raised it. What exactly hap-
pened after that is not clear. Proba-
bly nothing.

The list goes on: Terrorism. This
is a perennial. Any day now, we are
going to go to the source — some-
times Cuba, sometimes Iran. The
Grace Commission. Quality in the
schools. Prayer in the schools.
Almost anything in the schools. The
Reagan adminstration uses the

schools as a prop and thinks of them .

the way Victorians thought of the
poor: If only they had more moral-
ity, they would, undoubtedly,
prosper.

Even the vaunted economic pro-
gram, a success of sorts, had goals
that were enunciated as if simply
proclaiming them would make them_
happen. The budget was supposed
to be balanced by now — a goal at
least as important as reducing taxes
and increasing the defense budget.

It’s dizzying — all the more so
since liberals are supposed to have
their heads in. the clouds while con-
servatives have their feet on the
ground. It has not worked out that
way. Instead, we have government
by photo opportunity and enough
discontinuity to match a night of tel-
evision programming. In Ronald
Reagan’s Washington, one thing
often has nothing to do with
another. That’s because Ronald
Reagan’s Washington is like Holly-'
wood: Someone keeps yelling
“Cut!” Once it was a director. Now
it’s reality.

Group

prior; however, officials refused to
meet with BAS. A .
Exactly what was to be done
about the problem remained unas-
certainable until Jan. 15, 1969, the
birthday of King. The BAS consti-
tuency was informed that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgl_i’s computer
center, which housed the university’s
main data base, would be the target
location. So it happened that at 6
p.m., the Black Action Society
stormed the eighth floor computer

‘center and , seized it by force.

Approximately 60 angry and radi-
cal, yet determined people partici-
pated. Representation came from
the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), the Black Panther
Party, athletes, “black Greek organi-
zations, faculty and community
members, a computer expert to
insure the safety of the computer
and one young white man, deter-
mined to be a part of the takeover,
fought" his way up to the center. His
clothes ragged, he provided the
Black Action Society with food
supplies.

The hours were long,-yet BAS
would remain locked inside until
their demands ‘were met; therefore,

negotiation was inevitable. A.«few -

delegates were selected to present
the demands to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar.

On Jan. 16, l969,'at 3 a.m., Pos-

var agreed to meet the demands
which in effect were that:

0There would be no punitive mea-
sures taken against any of the dem-
onstrating members, provided that
the computer equipment was in
good shape.

0The univeristy would provide
better action on the demands of
black students.

0An institution for black students
would be established, which would

provide -scholarships and financial.

aid to blacks.

0A special recruiter and a recruit-
ing team, to be screened by the BAS,
be established to recruit more black
students to the school.

0A special section in Hillman
Library be set up for black students.

0Two black holidays be recog-
nized during the school year. The
two dates, which must be approved
by the Faculty Senate, were Jan. 15,
the birthday of King, and Feb. 2!,
the anniversary of the death of Mal-

' colm X.

‘From that time seventeen years

I ago to the fall of l9_8_5, the Black

Action Society and concerned black
faculty, administrators and staff
have engaged in a number of tactics,
strategies and actions (with the
assistance of the community), to see
to it that the concerns of black peo-
ple expressed in those demands have

been dealt with. Out of these efforts, .

with the help of "all concerned,.
-evolved the following departments
and organizations: the University-
Community Educational Program,
the Black Studies Program, the

Afro-American Collections at Hil- ,' _’

lman Library and the Organization
of Black Administrators, Faculty,
Staff and Students. OFBASSS is
now known as Equipose. —

Let me once again assure you that
all of these programs are designed
for your academic, political and

social enlightenment. However, we .

do not want your support to be on a
periodical basis. Our office is open

to all students and I strongly advise ‘

you —— for the sake of the ongoing
black struggle throughout the world
— that you stop by and become an
active member. “Please do not settle

for being just another statistic; make A

your presence felt.”

From Under My Desl</ Dan Bates
Coping with PAT buses

\You have now reached the turning
point in your young lives when you
must take your first steps into the
real world.

It’s time for you to give up those
storybook memories of that big yel-
low school bus with the fatherly or
motherly bus driver. Instead, you

must wholeheartedly confront the —
harsh realities’ of college and yes, -

PAT buses. -

As Pitt students, you will find that
PAT buses are an integral part of
campus life, whether you ride them
daily as commuters, use them infre-
quently to visit the wonderful city of
Pittsburgh or merely cross in front
of them on Fifth Avenue.

My life depends on PAT buses,

which could very well explain why_:

my life can become quite compli-
cated and even downright difficult.
Over the years, though, I have
learned to deal somewhat effectively
with commuting, and I would like to
pass on some words of wisdom, and
perhaps caution when necessary, to
all vulnerable novices who must face
the every day fealities of PAT.
First, you must realize that bus
stops are only there for the bus
driver if he chooses to stop at any
given time. I guess they just don't
always feel like stopping. Fre-
quently, I have watched buses
approach my stop, but they forget to
stop. Occasionally, though, the bus
driver will pause to smile at me and
wave — just before he passes by. . '
Also, if the bus stop is located just

before a traffic light, forget it. You
see, the importance of beating the
red light far surpasses that of picking
up passengers. Try to understand.
However, there are ways to effec-
tively stop a bus. One friend of mine

suggested lassoing the ‘bus, but for

some reason, I think this might be
impractical.

_ More realistically, many people
ritually jump up and down, waving
their hands in a dramatic display of
frustration and aggravation. This is
usually accompanied by a loud,
garbled scream that, when trans-
lated, means, “Stop the bus!” Most
of the time, this will work.

If all else fails, I sometimes des-
perately resort to jumping in front of
the bus. Once, I was trying to cross a
street to get to the bus stop when the
bus approached. Cars would not
stop to allow me to cross, and the
bus driver was paying little attention
to my valorous attempts to catch the

- bus. So I did the only logical thing

possible at that moment.

I stormed into'the street, forcing
all traffic to a halt. Then I jumped
daringly in front of the bus, not
moving an inch until the driver indi-

cated that he would stop. Lucky for .

me, he stopped. .

I must warn you, though. I cannot
guarantee that all buses will stop for
you — even if you are standing in
front of them. ,

When buses do stop, don't expect
them to be on time. Time is appar-
ently not of the essence to them. And

 

when you arrive at the stop early, ‘V
expect them almost always to be ‘

late. However, when you arrive on
time or late, the bus will assuredly
pass by early. Bus schedules become
a vague technicality. ’

Through rain, snow, sleet or hail,

- bus drivers will stay home, at least

sometimes. They do not follow any
creeds of dedication like our post-
men. I suppose they are sort of, shall
we say, fair-weather friends, if we
can call them friends.

Granted, there are some very nice
drivers, but a vast majority can be

impatient, rude and outright nasty. .

Last week, a driver let out a loud,
disgusted sigh when I asked him to
stop at the next bus stop. When we
did arrive, he stopped hardly long
enough for me to exit the bus. I guess
I was asking a bit too much.

Once, I greeted a bus driver while
climbing into the bus. “Good morn-
ing," I said. He looked at" me,
lowered his eye brows and abruptly
shouted, “Just get on the bus, will
you! We gotta get going!” I must
have ruined his day.

My day‘, however. was not ruined.
You see, I expected it. I have expe-
rienced the many perils of commut-
ing by bus, and I have come to
accept them. These problems don’t
bother me anymore.

In time, you willilearn to accept
them also. Until then, though, I offer

only’ one word of solid advice —

WALK!

Hospital, another specialty institu-
tion, agreed in principle to join in the.
medical center, but the actual move
did not take place until 10 years
later.

'- Finding a general hospital to

become the university’s prime teach-
ing hospital was much more diffi-

.cult. After extensive negotiations,

Presbyterian Hospital, a small sec-
tarian institution, agreed to join the
center. However, the hospital lacked

, the funds to build a first-rate facility.

So, together with Eye and Ear and
Magee Womens hosptials, a plan
was devised to incorporate all three
institutions into one large structure
——with each hospital having its own
wing. Plans were drawn up in the
1920s when the Pittsburgh econo_my
was booming. In 1929, the Great
Depression brought construction to

; a halt. Money was scarce, and funds
‘had to be sought to complete the

facility.

Eye and Ear moved into its new
quarters in 1934, and Presbyterian
Hospital followed four years later.

The Magee Womens Hospital wing‘

was completed in 1939. An outpa-
tient clinic, a gift from Maurice and
Leon Falk, brought to a close the
first ‘phase of the medical center’s
growth. When Falk Clinic opened in
1934 offering free medical care to the
poor, as many as 800 patients

ﬂocked to its doors each day. A psy-

chiatric hospital, conceived by the

estate in 1928, was completed in 1942.

What is now Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic became part of
the university in 1949.

it!!!

These hospitals, the medical

school and several other institutions
- are now part of a corporation, Uni-

versity Health Center of Pittsburgh,
officially established in 1965. It has
its own full-time staff and a board of
directors which coordinates the
actions of the constituent members.

The medical school plays a signifi-
cant role in the health center man-

 

agement. ‘Hospital physicians must
be members of the medical school
faculty, and new clinical services
must interface with the departmen-

tal structure ‘of the medical school.
# it #

The medical center, while crucial
to the future growth of the school,
was only one part of a bigger _equa-
tion. Faculty development was of
equal importance. During the diffi-
cult years of the Depression, much
of the staff consisted of volunteers.
However, when Dr. William
Swindler McEllroy became dean in
1938, he actively recruited full-time
clinical faculty members who spe-
cialized in laboratory research.

“There was a professor’ by the
name of Mortimer Tone,”
remembers Dr. Irwin Allan Solow, a
1941 graduate. “He was considered
the best teacher and the toughest,
and we would come into school on
Saturdays, even though there were
not any classes, just to watch him
work in the lab.

“And sometimes at night we
would go watch Dr. Boroni, who
was the head of obstetrics at Magee,
deliver very difficult cases. He was a

real showman — it was more fun»

watching him deliver babies than it
was going to a movie or watching
TV.”

The battleﬁeld campus

McEllroy’s plans were disrupted,
however, by the start of World War
II. For a time, the campus resembled
a battlefield as students in uniform
performed weekly maneuvers. The
second and ' third ﬂoors of ‘the
Cathedral of Learning were given
over as temporary quarters for the
recruits. The Surgeon General
imposed a wartime schedule on the
nation’s medical schools and stu-
dents were forced to attend year-
round. ‘

The war itself had .a profound
effect on medical education as more
doctors were introduced to special-
ized medicine while in the military.

Doctors returning from the armed
forces began turning from general
medicine to research. '

A focus on research

Reacting to the new demands of
specialized medicine, McEllroy
began to recruit aggressive young
researchers.

In 1947, he hired his first full-time
clinical faculty member, Thaddeus
S. Doanowski, M.D., an endocri-
nologist whose research was sup-
ported by a grant foundation. Jonas
E. Salk joined the faculty that year
as a researcher in virology.

McEllroy needed money to keep
the influx of researchers ﬂowing and
slowly he attractedoutside funding.

"Local philanthropists and founda-

tions contributed more than $50 mil-
lion to build and furnish the current

lor for the Health Professions Dr.
Robert A. Moore, M.D. McEllroy’s
plan for faculty development got a
boost from a joint $15-million medi-
cal school endowment given by the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and
the Richard King Mellon Founda-
tion. The income was used to attract
a strong full-time faculty.

In 1958, Francis Sargent Cheever
became the seventh dean of the med-
ical school.‘ During his tenure, full-
time faculty members were recruited
in medicine and surgery, and a new
department of preventive medicine
was established. The new Scaife Hall
facilities allowed class size to
increase to about 100 students, and
more out-of-state students attended.
By 1966, the medical school endow-
ment reached $25.2 million, and a
grant of $3.2 million from the R.K.
Mellon Charitable Trust was used to

pleted in-1956, the 13-story building

rooms, lecture halls, faculty and

ogy. About this same time, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh became a state-
related institution, preserving its pri-
vate status while receiving state
tuition subsidy for Pennsylvania
residents.

A new commitment to social
services

The late 1960s was a time of social
activism, and this was reflected in
the medical school. Through the
department of preventive and social
medicine, students took summer

.-

clerkships in Kentucky mining com-
munities, on Navajo reservations in
the American Southwest or in local
poverty-stricken neighborhoods.
For the first time, black students
were actively recruited, and the med-
ical school
orientation program for black
students still in- high school.

When Dean Cheever became vice
chancellor in 1970, Donald M.
Medearis — then chairman of the
department of pediatrics ~ was
selected as the new dean by the
faculty. A new curriculum gave stu-
dents greater freedom to conduct
independent research and to individ-
ualize their education program, with
the entire fourth year devoted to
elective courses.

,,Under deans Gerhard Werner
(1975-1979) and Donald F. Leon
(1979-1984), the medical school has
cooperated in interdisciplinary
efforts with other faculties in health
sciences, natural sciences and cer-
tain professionalschools.

through indexes and abstracts —-
going from one carrel to another,
copying information, straining eyes
and bending backs. Research at
Hillman Library is going to be easier
this year.

’For several years, Hillman
Library has offered students the ser-

vices of the LEARN center, a com- ‘

puter" searching facility. With
LEARN, however, the librarian
-operates the computer.

Since February, Hillman Library

has been developing a microcompu-. A

’ter searching library. Through this
service, students themselves can
gather references for their research
projects in a matter of minutes. Fern
Brody, coordinator of data base ser-
vices for Hillman, said, “It, was a

natural progression to allow stu--

dents to access -the computers.” .
The process is no more difficult
than banking-with an automatic
teller. One needs only to supply the
computer with a specific topic. '
Limiting the topic is the most
common problem students expe-
rience, according to_ Brody. “Stu-
dents. often don’t think about the
topic before they come here,”'_ she

' I, said.

“For example,__ someone was
‘researching President/Ca‘rter.V They

used the name James instead of
Jimmy, and the search came up
empty. Librarians are usually better

at picking terms and limiting top- ~

ics," she said.

From February until mid-April,
1127 people used the Microcompu-
ter ‘Searching Laboratory at Hill-
man. “We assume that it will be a
larger number in the fall,” Brody
said." ’

“Most problems come from first-
time users. But we’ve rewritten the
instructions, summarizing and con-

densing material. The system is now _

100 percent user friendly,” Brody

' asserted.

“We plan on using a questionnaire
in the fall to gauge the 'sytem’s effec-
tiveness,” Brody said. This service is
only an experiment at present but

.will probably become a permanent

part of the library.‘ ‘ .

“One of the stipulations of the

experiment was that the system
should be viable and affordable. At
some point, we may have to charge a
fee to pay’ for the rental of data
bases,” she said. At this time, how-

- ever, the service is free.

A data base, according to Brody,
is a collection of records in a form
that is readable by the computer. In
this case, entries in the data base
consist of a list of sources and a brief
summary. ‘Data bases are not
records of complete texts. By typing
key words into the computer, the
researcher will receive a printed list
of sources ‘which must ‘then, be

' gathered by hand.

According to Brody, data bases

were devised by the aerospace indus- U

try to codify the snowballing litera-

ture of technology. Lockheed, for

example, developed a data base

called DIALOG. Currently made up

of 300 separate data bases, DIA-
LOG is now a subsidiary-of Lock-

heed land can be. rented by any
institution or individual.

- Hillman Library subscribes to
several different data base services,
similiar to DIALOG in" that they are
made up of smaller specialized data
bases. The university library system
can search through 500 different
data bases, containing information
on topics from “A” to “Z.”

There is a certain amount of over-
lap, according to Brody, but the
advantage in subscribing to more
than one service is that it gives the

library. one of the largest, most
‘ diverse bodies of information avail-

able to users. “I don’t know of
another universitylibrary that has as
many packages‘ as we do,” she said.

According to Brody, the director
of the university ‘library system
worked on a document for Pitt’s
Five Year Plan that dealt with a

i more active role for students, in the

computerized library system. “It’s
the future fdr libraries in general,
and we’re ahead in the game,” Brody
said. _

The microcomputer searching
laboratory‘ can be used by Pitt stu-
dents, staff or faculty upon presenta-
tion of a valid ID card. It is open
from 9 am. to 9 p.m. on weekdays,

and from noon to 4:30 p.m. on

Saturdays and Sundays.

‘ Campus sex: attitudes narrow, pregnancy rises

I3y Nadia Moritz

Features Editor

The nation's growing conserva-

V tive tones have finally extended to

sexuality. According to social
observers, sexual attitudes are more
conservative today than they have
been for the last two decades, and
the mood on campus has shifted as
well.

Although a recent survey by.the
National Center for Health Statis-
tics found that three-fourths of
American women have sexual inter-
course before they marry, the level
of virginity on college campuses is
up.
. ociology professor Robert Sher-
win of Miami University, Oxford,
Oh., along with colleague Sherry
Corbett conducted a longitudinal
study of sexual behavior that

' spanned 21 years and involved more

than 3,000 students. The study
found that in 1963, 75 percent of the
college women were virgins. By
1978, the figure had dropped to 36
percent; by .1984, it had risen to 43
percent. The male virginity rate, on
the other hand, dropped from 40
percent in 1963 to 28 percent in 1984.
“Many years ago, there was a‘

tyranny that you had to be a virgin,”

said Sherwin. “Then we A went
through a period when there was
another tyranny —— you had to be
promiscuous. Today, I think we're
getting a relaxing of both extremes,
allowing for more self-expression. I
think the social standard is broader

- now and gives people more choice.” .

This broader social standard has

I been enhanced by the women's

movement. “Male pressure on

‘ women to have sex hasn't changed,"

said Dorothy Cohen, director of
counseling and career planning at
Maryville College in St. Louis, “but
I think women are feeling more self-
assured. Instead of succumbing to

 the pressure, they are standing back
i and asking themselves, ‘Do I really

want to do this? Am I doing it for the
reasons that I think are right?’ ”
Sex as a matter of individual can-
science has become the prevailing
sexual ethic on campus. This trend
was confirmed in a recent book by

' Mirra‘ Komarovcky, a professor at

Barnard College in New York who
interviewed 232 female undergradu-

ates. “Despite the diversity," said

Komarovcky, “the dominant feeling
was that sexual experience is more '
desirable in the context of friends,
not promiscuity."

“My friends aren't horrified at the
idea of having sex," said Lisa Rich-
mond of the University of Virginia,
“but they think there should be a
relationship. Not necessarily to be in
love, but they want some kind of
stability.”

nant every year do not want to _be,
and one out oftwo ofthose pregnan-
cies are terminated by abortion. The
reason for the unwanted pregnan-

cies is usually improper and incon-

sistant contraceptives.

The practice of contraception is
growing. In 1979, for example, 49
percent of the sexually active teenag-
ers said they used birth control,
compared with 38 percent in 1976.
But reliancy on withdrawal and the
rhythm method increased 86 percent
in this time period. I

The misuse of contraceptives does
not change as the teens move from
high school to college. Although col-
lege students are exposed to more
biology, they are not necessarily any
more responsible, and the conse-
quences of this irresponsibility are
often overlooked. V

The difficulty in computing the
effects of college pregnancy arises
partially from the fact that the avail-
able statistics are normally broken
down into age brackets of 15
through 19, and 20 through 35.

“Recently around the’ country,
there has been a lot of concern over
teenage pregnancy. A lot of research
has been funded for the l5-to-l9-
year-old brakcet, but it’s not being
broken down into 19, 20 and 21 year
olds,” said‘ Dayna J ornsay, director

of education at Planned Parenthood .

of Pittsburgh. “The problem has as
much impact on their lives as it does
with teens. The decision is‘ just as
difficult.” ,

In fact, college women are at the
highest risk of experiencing an
unplanned preganancy. According
to the 1984 Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Health abortion statistics,
women between the ages of 20 and
24 have achieved the highest abor-
tion rate in the state — 21,000 out of
59,000. ‘

“This group is a target popula-
tion,” said Janet Catov of Women’s
Health Services. “It bafﬂes people.
They think that it is not the same
issue that it is for minors, but it is.”

Part of the problem, according to
J ornsay, is the change in lifestyle as
men and women enter the college
community. “You are no longer liv-
ing at home —— now you have free-
dom, your own room,” said J ornsay.
“With this increased freedom, the
issue of sexual relationships is going
to come up — and that leads to
pregnancy.”

Increased freedom, however, does
not necessarily mean increased
knowledge. “A lot of the misinfor-
mation about pregnancy is just
ignorance of the female reproduc-
tive system, said Janet Devoe, the
family planning director at Pitt.
“Friends who think they understand
it give wrong advice, and it perpetu-
ates." Recent studies have proven
that American teens, more so than_in

during which time it travels through A

the Fallopian tubes and into the u-
terus. The egg can be fertilized at any
point in this travel. Sperm cells are
deposited inside or outside the vagi-
na during intercourse; In either case,
within minutes they move up into
the uterus and through the tubes.
Sperm can live for three days in this
sheltered environment. ’
“The whole situation is unpredic-
table,” said ~Jornsay. “You can get

pregnant on Tuesday from sex that

you had on Friday.”

Ovulation is another unpredicta-
ble factor. '

“The problem is that the ovula-
tion process is not something that
can be predicted. Different women
ovulate at different times,” Devoe
said. “There is a lot of misinforma-
tion about when you can get preg-

nant and when you are safe. But you t

are never really safe.”

Fear of health risks is another rea-
son for contraceptive misuse,
according to a 1983 report by the
Alan Guttmacher Institute. For
example, periodic reports have

o matter the tone, sexual rela-
tionships in college present another,
more painfully realistic possibility
—— pregnancy,

‘The pains of this problem are sta-
tistically stagggering — one million
teenage women become pregnant
each year. That’s one out ofevery 10,
the highest rate in the developed
world.

A study conducted in 1981 by the
Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private
reproductive research firm, found
that 96 out of 1,000 American teen-
age women become pregnant each
year, compared to 45 in England, 44
in Canada, and 35 in Sweden. The
level of sexual activity among teen-
agers is the same, but the liberality of
the sexual attitudes and availability
of contraceptives are not. ,

On scale, half of the six-million
American women who become preg-

other countries, learn of birth con-
trol from unreliable sources — their
peers.

“There aren't too many people
who haven‘t heard of birth control,
but there are a lot of myths that play
into the ignorance factor," said
Jornsay. “I hear a lot of ‘lthought I
couldn‘t get pregnant the first time’
or ‘I won’t get pregnant if he doesn’t
ejaculate inside me’ or ‘I don’t have
sex often enough to get pregnant.’
But we just create the myths and
believe them because we don’t want
to believe that it is going to happen
to us. We don‘t want to face the
facts."

The biological ‘facts of pregancy
are very simple. The female repro-
ductive system runs on a normal
cycle of 28 days. An egg is released

"from the ovaries once during this

linked the birth control pill to heart
attacks, stroke, blood clots, inferti_l-
ity, liver disease and cancer. These
reports have prompted many
women to discontinue use of the pill
and some never to try it. V

“The fear of safety hazards adds
to the reluctance of using thepill,
and it’s misleading media hype,”
said Jornsay. “For young healthy
women, there are minimal risks.
Pills are more safe now than ever
before.” .

Perhaps the strongest factor that
figures predominantly in the college
pregnancy issue is something Jorn-
say refers to as the human factor.
“Sexual feelings don't give way to
rational thinking;'it’s pure romance.
In our society, sex just happens,"
Jornsay said. “We get swept away
and I10 one says, ‘Hey, wait a min-

2

and get'some foam and condoms.’
That would be unromantic, and for
a lot of people, it’s just not in their
thinking.”

This same spur-of-the-moment
sexual attitude and communication
was demonstrated in a study at John
Hopkins University. In a. survey
exploring the situational factors
involved, only 17 percent of the
young women and 25 percent of the
men interviewed had planned their
first act of intercourse. Out of those
percentages, only 49 percent of the
females and 44 “percent of the males
used contraceptives. _ _

“Practicality and contraception
just don’t fit into any of our images,”
said Jornsay.‘ “She isat» his apart-
ment and the lights are low and the
emotions are high and even if she has
her diaphragm, it’s just not in the
picture. We‘ have to get people to
think about these issues before they
get into these situations.”

But sex education raises another

entanglement of issues. With the
prevention of preganancy goes the
debate of access to contraceptives
and abortion. These issues collide
with the policies of the Reagan
administration, which has advo-
cated sexual abstinence. Under the
1982 Adolescent Family Life Pro-
gram, .the administration has chan-
neled funds to 71 projects around
the country that stress that teenagers
have an option to say no to sex.

“The. administration would like
the problem of teenage pregnancy to
go away,” said, professor Frank Fur-
stenbery, a sociologist at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. “First, it took
an ostrich-like position. Now, it is
trying to wish backithe situation.”

According to the National Family
Planning and Reproductive Health
Association, a nonprofit association
representing the 4,000 clinics receiv-
ing federal money through Title X of
the Public Service Act (a federal
program providing contraception
services and counseling to ‘low-
income women and teens), 1,000

clinics closed after federal financing”

was cut by 13 percent in 1981.

The latest Guttmacher report,
published in March, has encouraged
some members of Congress to kick
more closely at the teen pregnancy
issue, according to Daren Pittman
of the Children’svDefense Fund. The
report shows that the lowest rates of
teen pregnancy occur in other devel-
oped countries where liberal atti-
tudes toward a sex and readily
available contraceptives prevail, and
where sex is more openly discussed

r

media.

In Europe, sex is dealt with more
honestly. In America, according to
Jornsay, it is considered in a nega-
tive way.

Professor Furstenberg com-
mented that the problem is that the
United States is reluctant to accept
the notion that sexual activity and
marriage are no longer tied together.

This lack of openness has been
revealed recently with television net-
works and the advertising of contra-
ceptives. Although the official ban
prohibiting the advertising of con-
traceptives on television has been
lifted, according to Jornsay, the
unofficial bans are still in effect.

“In the media, sex can sell every-
thing,” said Jornsay, “but we’re not
allowed to publicly educate about

99 .

SCX.

The resulting media effect results
in the teen receiving conflicting mes-
sages about sex. On one side, there is
the cultural communication that sex
before marriage is wrong. As Moral
Majority leader Jerry Falwell puts
it, “Sex outside marriage is
dishonorable.” -

On the other side, there are rock ,

videos, teen-culture films, television
programs and advertisements that
portray sex in an idealist, soft-focus
fashion. A commerical for Coty
Wild Musk is a, good example. Two
tattered, nearly nude adolescents
stalk through a jungle_while being

revealed in camera close-ups with 5

expressions reeking of sexual

' urgency. Sex is imminent, but what

about contraception?

“I think advertising contracep-
tives on national television would do .

a world of good,” said Jornsay.
“Having it mentioned in any sense

would help to change the public atti- -

tudes about the place of contracep-
tion. Maybe if you had some nice

macho guy saying ‘I always use Tro-

jans’ it would encourage responsibil-
ity, and help dispel someof the

' myths." .

A television spot for the use of the.
contraceptives in Sweden promotes
such responsibility. It portrays a
young woman telling her partner
she's gone off the pill. “What are you
going to use instead?” he asks.
“Guess,” she answers, snapping a
condom against his bare bottom.

“Even if it was incorporated on
the advertising levelof the media, if
it was something that could be con-
sidered within the daily aspects of
life, it would have an effect,” said
Catov. “The only problem I foresee
is the commercial creating a false
security . about over-the-counter

contraceptives. People don’t always —

understand how to ‘use them
properly.” _

The decision to" use contraception
traditionally has been left to the
female partner.

“The woman has always been

. responsible for the bearing, rearing_

and raising of the children,” said
J ornsay. “It was always her decision
to take responsibility for the preven-
tion: She is the one that gets

' pregnant.”

- Women agree to surgical steriliza-
tion twice as often as men and use
more short-term contraceptives as
well. Besides the social and cultural
reasons for this imbalance, there is a
scientific factor. Despite premature
publicity of male contraceptives, the
basic problem is that (for a wide va-

riety of reasons) the male reproduc- .

tive system is far more complicated
than that of the female. Science has
not yet been able to find an effective
reversible chemical contraceptive
for men. Experts say the possibility
of a male pill is at least 10 years in the
future. ’ ”

According to Jornsay, there are 5

also social andpolitical implications

. to male birth control.

“Are women going to trust the
man to take the pill when she is the
one who is going to get pregnant if
he doesn’t?” questioned Jornsay.
“Plus, the trend in research has been
that itis. moving at a snail’s pace
because there is not funding. Are
men going to fund a project that
would mean that theywould have a

' new responsibility?”

College women choose pill asmost favored contraceptive I 

By Nadia Moritz_
Features Editor

Every year, 36 million women face
the task of trying to avoid preg-
nancy. Ninety percent of them make
an attempt at birth control, yet three
million end up with unwanted preg-
nancies. Most of the pregnancies are
the result of improper and inconsist-
ent contraceptive use. a
' During the woman’s college years,
more so than any other time in her
life, birth control suddenly becomes
a necessary decision. Underlying
cultural messages promoting purity
combine with peer pressure, new
freedom and more serious relation-
ships, and the decision becomes a
complicated one.

But how to decide? The first thing
to remember is that there is no such
thing as a risk-free contraceptive
(except forabstinence), and there is
no one best method for everyone.
Plus, the _best choice is likely to
change several times during the
course of a woman’s life.

Family planning and health
experts over the past 25 years have
pointed to age, martial status, cost
and availability as the major inﬂuen-
ces through which women choose
birth control. For college women,
birth control is more available and
at lower costs than for any other
female age bracket.

The Pitt News, ()rlerita%tlen”}‘lsslle I-if   

“When the pill‘ was brand new, there were some
concerns about safety. But now we have the expe-
rience of time and the data are overwhelmingly sup-
portive of the pill as a safe, effective contraceptive.

-—‘Jane_t Devoe, director of Family Planning

tor of Pitt’s Family Planning
Department, Pitt’s gynecological
services in Forbes Clinic offer a ser-
ies of sex education programs, along
with counseling and gynecological
exams. It’s all free, covered by the
student health fee, and contracep-
tives can be obtained at discount pri-
ces from student health’s pharmacy.

“The best way to make a birth
control decision is to incorporate it

into a gynecological exam,” said

Devoe. “As women start having sex
at a younger age, they are exposed to
more infections. Plus, an exam and
contraceptive instruction encour-
ages their proper use.”

The birth control acquisition is
conducted at Forbes Clinic by first
going through a half-hour informa-
tional program taught by graduate
students, and then through a com-

plete gynecological" exam. Getting g

the women.to the clinic is the most
difficult part of the process, accord-
ing to Devoe.

“The attitude is still one of embar-
rassment and intimidation. By mak-

int: the inquiry about contraception.

they are admitting that they a_re sex-
ual beings,” said Devoe. “They think
that-we are going to morally judge
them, but we don’t. Afterward, they
usually say, ‘That was easy.’ ”

The contraceptives available to.

college women todayare diverse
enough to fit into any lifestyle or
relationship.

The birth control pill is the bench-
mark by ‘which consumers and
experts have come to judge the
safety and effectiveness of all contra-
ceptives. Although sterilization is
the nation’s leading birth control
method, ‘the pill is used more often

I by women under 35. According to

Devoe, it is used twice asqoften as
any other contraceptive adminis-
tered by Forbes Clinic.

_ The pill p‘revents pregnancy by
preventing ovulation. It’s taken
daily, and the hormone-like sub-
stances in it keep the femalesbody
from releasing its monthly egg. The

prescription costs about $4 a month

from _Pitt’s student health _ phar-
macy, and about $12 in a drugstore.
The pill is 99 percent effective. It’s

easy to use, and it allows for sponta-
neity. As Dayna Jornsay, education
director of Planned Parenthood of
Pittsburgh, said, “It fits into the col-
lege lifestyle." But what about the
health risks?

Despite media myths, the pill is 

the safest method of contraception
for women under 25 who‘do not
smoke. The pill is most dangerous
for women over 35, those who have
had the previous health problems of
stroke, heart disease, and breast or

reproductive cancer, and those who.

smoke (although 40 percent of pill
users do). ~
Otherwise, there are actually

health benefits from taking the pill,

a reduced risk of ovary, uterous
and breast cancer; pelvic infections;
and a variety of menstrual disorders
are a few. The pill also provides a
slight protection against sexually
transmitted diseases.

 

“When the pill was brand new, 7 If

there were some concerns about

safety,” said Jornsay. “But now‘ we ‘

have the experience of time, and the
data are overwhelmingly supportive
of the pill as a safe, effective
contraceptive.”

The biggest problem with the pill, I
according to Devoe, is when women‘-.

mistake unpleasant side effects -

like nausea or weight gain — for
dangers. Among college women,

Devoe has noted an emphasis on this ..
concern of side effects.

“We still have a lot of students-
that are more concerned about gain-
ing weight than having a stroke, and
we have to put things in a different
perspective,” said Devoe. “It’s all
part of that media image, and col-
lege students are plagued‘ by living
up ‘to that image of beauty.” '

Contraception

continued from page ﬁfteen

'— and the pill, Devoe noted, is a fear of

not attaining a certain image of

purity. _
“A lot of college women are afraid

to be prepared to have sex with a guy

‘they are dating because they think,

‘What will he think of me if I'm

already on the pill,’ "’ said Devoe.

“They think that if they are prepared
for the situation,,they are more
likely to have sex,"-and to lose their
reputation, but it doesn't _work that
way."

Other, less popular methods of
contraception include various bar-
rier methods —— diaphrams, con-
doms, sponges and foams. Other
than occasional irritation or allergic
sensitivity, no health risks are
directly associated with these
methods, and they even protect
against sexually transmitted dis-
eases. The main problem is,the high

rate of unwanted pregnancy, which
averages two or three during the
course of a woman’s reproductive
life span.

The diaphram is a strong, thin and
‘soft rubber dome used with jelly and
inserted over the cervix, thus acting
as both a physical and chemical bar-
rier. Diaphram fitting can be done
during a gynecological exam, the
device is inserted no longer than two
hours prior to intercourse, the effec-
tiveness rate is 81 percent, and the
cost is about $9. .

The contraceptive sponge, mar-
keted as Today sponges, is a
doughnut-shaped, polyurethane
piece, treated with spermicide, and
selling for about $l each. The device
is inserted by the woman, ﬁtting
over the uterus, and acting as a phys-
ical and chemical barrier by prevent-
ing the sperm -from entering the
uterus, and, at the same time, killing
the ones that do with spermicide.

1- THE DAILY NUMBER,

Sponges are 85 percent effective.
According to Jornsay, this method
is gaining popularity among college
women.

“The sponge can be inserted up to
24 hours before intercourse,” said
Jornsay, “so the woman can put it in
before she leaves for class in the
morning and have sex that night and
not worry, or be inconvenienced."

Although Devoe noted that most
of the contraceptives administered
at Forbes Clinic are female orient-
ated, she _has noticed a recent trend
in condom sales. Although recent
studies have suggested that condoms

are largely unpopular among Amer- ,

ican men and women, D_evoe said
that attitude has begun to change.

“I think it has a lot to do with the
rise in sexually transmitted dis-
eases,” said Devoe. “In college, with
the types and the patterns of rela-
tionships, the partners are less famil-
iar and more frequent.”

“It is also important that students

realize the benefits of condoms,”

Jornsay said. “They are 90 percent
effective, they are inexpensive, easily
available and they act as a safety
barrier_for students who may not
know their partners as well.”

Intrauterine devices (lUDs) are
also administered by Forbes Clinic,
even though they, like many clinics,
have curbed theirirecommendation
to young women with recent reports
and incidents of infection.

The IUD is a small, plastic device‘

that is inserted by the physician into
the uterus for a certain length of

time. By creating a mild inﬂamation _

on the wall of the uterus, it makes
fertilization difficult. The clinic does
not recommend this method to
women who have not had at least
one full term pregnancy. ‘
Forbes Clinic, 3515 Forbes Ave.,
offers services including routine
exams, contraceptive care, preg-

-nancy testing, treatment of sexually

transmitted diseases and other gyne-
cological procedures-. Appointments
should be made two weeks in

advance. '

partner to assume contracep-
tive responsibility, according to
Devoe, the decision is often a
combined one and more couples
are visiting the gynecological
clinics together. Recent studies
support the notion that male
involvement in the decision is
one of the strongest determi-
nants in the decision to use a con-
traceptive during intercourse.

According to Devoe, the trend
among college men last year was
one that moved away from the
sexual stereotype of male insen-
sitivity. At Pitt, more male resi-
dence halls requested the sex
education program than did
female groups, "

“Communication is
something that is lack-'
ing on the whole on col-
lege campuses. ”

—— Janet Devoe, ‘A Director
of Family Planning

“Men are concerned. We can
tell by the seriousness of the
questions they ask," said Devoe.
“They, too, are unfamiliar with
female anatomy, but they are
concerned about the health
hazards of the pill on their girl-‘
friends as well as the after-effects
of other contraceptives."

The same trend has surfaced at
other universities.

“I think we’re seeing more men
interested in taking responsibil-

A I rirenrr news, Orientation issue . August 30. 1985

ity for their sexual activities than
five or six years ago,” said Cherie
Kitchell, a clinical social worker
in the students’ mental health
department of the University of
Florida, “and we got a lot of
phone calls from men whose girl-
friends are too embarrassed to
admit they’re pregnant, and the
man takes things into his own
hands.” v

.But in any case, successful
contraception comes down to
one thing.

“Communication is something
that is lacking on the whole on
college campuses. Even though
the woman may not want to use a

particular contraceptive or’

whether she is even using any-
thing or not, the partner simply
doesn’t ask,” said Devoe.
Women and men simply have
to start talking — about sex, con-
traceptives and responsibility.
Communication is the only ele-
ment powerful enough to cut
through the layers of myths and
embarrassment that have
plagued college relationships.
An editorial in Mademoiselle
magazine by Peter Nelsen sums it
up:
“Since for the time being, men
and women have to be content
with ointments and sponges and
creams and condoms, we need to
figure out how to talk to one
another about it. While it’s hard
to imagine birth control ever
becoming the subject for senti-
mentality, I don’t see why it can’t
be something two people can
share. Because of our social con-
ditioning, the women may have
to- initiate the discussion, but I
think most men would join in
willingly and be glad to have the

‘subject out of the way.”

The Pitt News, ,.ortentau§'n Issue -   .-

Campus stress rises, but solutions are offered

By Susan Benedek
Staff Writer -

Once again thousands of students
descend upon Pitt. Here in the name
of chemistry, literature, business
and engineering, they will push'to
the limit mental muscle and physical
dexterity just to make the grade. In a
few weeks, the effects of this aca-
demic pursuit may become evident
as social, financial and scholastic
pressures transform even the most
disciplined student. The result is
stress.

Ac’cording to Constance Dancu,

psychologist and senior clinician at

Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, stress is how the mind and
body react to change. Stress can be
positive or negative, depending
upon how an individual manages the
changes in his or her life. Unfortu-
nately, studies have shown that the
reaction has been negative with col-
lege students.

For example, a recent poll at Iowa
State University indicated that 70
percent of its students are feeling
more stress now than lastifall. Con-
sidering the causes of this stress, 81
percent said that it was related to
financial matters; other causes
included availability of jobs after
graduation, tuition increases, the
nuclear arms_race, parking and the
availability of faculty to students.

“I venture that'Pitt students are

experiencing similar feelings. Some ‘

facets may differ, but usually stu-
dents are concerned about finan-
ces_,” said Shirley Haberman, health
educator for Pitt’s Student Health
Service. “These feelings may be

accented by the pressures to achieve .

and excel.”

Stress levels vary at different’

times during the term, and accord-
ing to the student’s age, said Haber-

i man, since there are_different issues
' that concern every level of being a

student. Freshmen, however, are the
most vulnerable. Dancu agrees.

“The freshman student has to
cope with overwhelming changes
that are occurring in their lives -
living away from home for the first
time, or demanding homework
assignments,” said Dancu. “It

appears now that stress is accumula- ,

tive. The more drastic the changes in
a person's life, the more stressful a
person may become. We can’t say
stress bothers everyone. Some peo-
ple manage well under stress. They
do their best work in deadline
situations.”

But this is not the case for many.
As in the Iowa State University sur-
vey, most of the students reported
not only being personally troubled
by stress, but also their classroom
performances are being effected as
well.

,And if stress is not controlled,
research has shown that it will
accumulate and perhaps overpower
the student's life to the point of men-
tal or physical breakdown.

“Reoccurring stress is, usually
attributed to the student not taking
the time out to resolve the issue,”
said Haberman. “You ~ can only

suppress a problem for so long,

before it resurfaces."

Many students do not realize that
they are under stress until physical
or biological symptoms appear —
fatigue, headaches, high blood pres-
sure. Research has shown that stress
is linked to asthma, heart disease,
depression and cancer.

“This is not to say that stress
causes physical ailment, but if a

body is under stress, the weakest link _

in the individual will go," said Kath-
leen Gruseck, a registered nurse and
consultant with the Pittsburgh chap-
ter of the American Red Cross.

In June” of 1982, a study was con-
ducted by John Jemmot of Prince-
ton University, Joan Borysenko of
Beth Israel Hospital and David
McClellend of Harvard Medical
School which measured the level of
antibodies found in the saliva in a

group of 64 first-year dental stu-
dents. During high-stress periods,

— such as major examinations, all of

the students had significantly lower
levels of the antibodies than during
periods of less stress, such as return-
ing from vacation. The research con-
cluded that stress may lower the-
body’s resistance to . infection by
temporarily inhibiting the antibod-
ies’ immune response.

“Many students have a lot of
responsibility placed upon them, but
stress is something we all have. It is a
part of living. How we respond to
stressful situations is the key,” said
Haberman.

But there isa good side to stress. A
number of studies have turned the
popular notion upside down that
stress is fundamentally harmful.
Research has uncovered that stress

heartbeat increases and oxygen-rich
blood is directed away from-the skin
to the brain and the skeletal muscles
for fast action. The pupils dilate to
take in more information and hor-
mones enter the blood to increase its
ability to coagulate in case of injury.
The surge of energy that comes with
the stress alarm better enables the
person to fight or ﬂee.

Once the alarm stage of stress has
passed, the body enters the second
stage, recuperation, where it repairs
any damage caused by the demands
of the fight-or-ﬂight response-

The third stage is a return to the
state of relaxed alertness. Bad or
harmful stress occurs when this nor-
mal stress pattern becomeslchronic
and the body never gets time to
recuperate properly.

is, in fact, a crucial, often productive ’
part of life. '

The idea that stress may be
healthy was pioneered by Dr. Hans
Seyle, who explained in his 1974
book, “Stress Without Distress,”
that there are three kinds of stress:
normal stress; distress or harmful
stress such as taking courses which

.students do not enjoy and do not do
well in because of frustration: and

finally, eustress or good productive
stress. .

“A certain amount of stress is
needed to tune you up for action and
keep you on your toes," wrote Seyle.

Seyle also identified the body’s
three-stage reaction to stress. The
first stage of any stress rection is

. alarm. The endocrine glands release
. hormones, including adrenaline, the

a temporary bad-stress cycle was

Scot_t Benzo, a CAS architectural
studies major.

“I applied for a student loan and, -

due to some sort of human error, my
application was not processed by the
deadline. I felt as if I couldn't do
anything, like my hands were tied,”
said Benzo. “Because of the lack of
sufficient funds, I underwent psy-
chological duress. I really felt that .
my grades were affected due to the
extra burden of ﬁnancial worries.
“Despite ‘all, I still feel lucky. I'm
alive and in good health. If I think of
that, the stress will go away. I just

keep telling myself that I‘ve been in .

worse situations and that isn't bad at
all," Benzo said.
Both the Red Cross and Student

Health Service offer stress-

management courses, so that stu-
dents like Scott can learn to adapt to
stressors in their environment.

“We try to teach people how to get
their bodies back to normal in a
short amount of time,” said Gru-
seck. “From what I've read, stressors
change from generation to genera-
tion, from culture to culture. But the
reactions are the same no matter if

it’s financial aid today or nuclear

war tomorrow.”

According to Gruseck, time man-
agement is the key to preventing and
alleviating stress. For example, a
person should try to avoid putting
himself or herself into tense situa-
tions where he or she is pressed to
perform. “If you become stressful in
traffic and every morning you are
tangled in a traffic jam, then the next
morning you should perhaps go in a
little earlier,” Gruseck explained.

Dancu emphasizes minimizing
procrastination. “I also advise that
students develop a social network as
quickly as possible. It is important
‘that stress be expressed and shared

' between confidants, whether in per-

son or over the phone," said Dancu.

This need to share stressful situa-
tions with confidants was affirmed,
by the Iowa survey. Ninety-five per-
cent of the students polled said that
they coped with stress through .talk-_
ing with friends, 49 percent by phon-
ing their parents and nine percent by
talking with a counselor. Other ways
of coping with stress include drink-
ing (3 I percent), reading (33 percent)
and exercise (74 percent).

Exercise is the anti-stress factor __ .

that Haberman recommends. “I
think there is a real imbalance with
students  too much studying or too
much socializing, and a program of
fitness is the first thing to be sacri-
ficed,” said Haberman. “The trick is
keeping your life and skills organ-
ized. You must achieve a balance

,between academic and social

;

fitness."

The Pitt News, Orientation Issue - A0803? 30: 1985

Greeks launch new campaign  
to change stereotyped image

By Dawn Lynn Funk
Staff Writer

Fraternities and sororities have
long been the object of both loyalty
and scorn, and may be the most ste-
reotyped groups of human beings
ever to walk the face of America. On
today’s college campuses, the
Greeks are taking a close look at
their image and making a new effort
to change, but the task is not an easy
one. ,

Sorority women have had to con-
tend with an image set in extremes.
There is the improper sorority girl
typified in popular pornographic
titles like “Sally Does Sigma Delt”
or “Sorority Swinger.” And‘ then
there. is the epitome of a prima
donna — part ofa set ofclones, who
are always clad in Guess jeans,
penny loafers, Greek-lettered sweat-
shirts and pearls —— always pearls.
This is the woman who goes to col-
lege to find a husband, and spends
most of her time painting her'finger-
nails, shopping and writing checks,
usually with Daddy’s money.

The fraternity image moves along
the lines of the men so moralistically
revealed in the popular film “Animal
House.” Stereotypes include the per-
verted fraternity man who would fill
a ﬂedgling nun with beer and leave
her dazed on the front lawn, the
sophisticated drunk with a beer in
one hand and a polo mallet in the
other and the slob whose room is

V furnished with dishware that hasn’t

seen daylight since theihouse was
built in 1983, and decorated with
enough centerfolds to stun a con-
victed sex-offender.

Then there are the fraternity nick-
names like Snake, Waste Product,
Zipp, Ziggy or Weasel. Biff, Skip
and Bucky were favorites of the fra-
ternity men of days gone by, but
these names went out of style with
swallowing goldfish._The Greek rep-
utation has not. Nonetheless, in an
age of conservative student trends,
Greeks are moving away from this
“Animal House” image. .

The idea of fraternities began a
the College of William and Mary in
I776 with the Phi Beta Kappa

V society. Like today’s Greeks, the

groupshad their own badge, sym-
bol, motto, ritual and pledge of
secrecy. They came together for
social and literary purposes, and
their fraternity embodied the ideals
of friendship.

During the 1920s, only the upper
crust of society could afford to join
fraternities and sororities. During
World War 11, they gave up their
houses for war. Druing the’ ’60s and

" ’70s, the Greeks were‘known for

their anti-war protesting, partying
and free-‘spirited behavior.

Today’s collegiate men and
women are seeking new fulﬁllment
in organizations during their college
careers.

These young collegiates 'want an
organization that will give them sup-
port scholastically, ‘morally and
socially, and are seeking organiza-
tions that are resume-oriented,
instead of recreation‘-oriented. The
Greek society is changing to mesh
with this trend.

'“Baird’s Manual Of American
College Fraternities” lists six pur-
poses for the social fraternity: (l)
recognition and respect for the
Deity; (2) encouragement of moral

living; (3) discouragement of gam-
- bling and the use of liquor; (4) mak-

ing much of friendships; (5)
emphasis on honesty and integrity;
and (6) promotion ofcharity. But do
today's social fraternities meet all of
these idealistic goals?

According to the Center for the
Study of College Fraternity
(CSCF), the moral development of
freshmen is neither enhanced nor
hindered "by affiliation with Greek
organizations, but fraternities and
sororities are taking on projects to
change this statement. One example
can be seen at Missouri Western
State College, where the Sigma
Gamma Tau fraternity revived an
on-campus escort service after an
attempted rape. I ,

Last winter, the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity (FIJI) began _a pro-
gram _entitled BADD (Brothers

 

“Women don ’t want
an organization that is
shallow. We want a
group to help us grow as
individuals. Our soror-
ity does not decide our
lives, they just support
our individuality.”

—,Chris Dunbar
Vice president,
Kappa Alpha‘ Theta

Against Drunk Driving). The pro-
gram is designed to make Greeks
more aware of the dangers of alco-
hol, but BADD doesn’t stop with
collegiates. BADD will be speaking
with local high school students this
September. FIJI President Bob Kra-
mer explains the program’s expan-
sion. “Too many times we tell
minors ‘Don’t drink.’ Well, let’s face
it, they will anyway. Our purpose is
to inform them about the dangers of
drinking and driving. Our message
is,“Be responsible.’ ” .
Kramer feels that fraternity men
have an advantage in the alcohol
awareness message. “Fraternities
are stereotyped with drinking. If a
45-year-old policeman says ‘Don’t
drink,’ it doesn't carry’much weight.
When it comes from the source, it
means a lot more. We want to set the
example.” .
V Another campus fraternity work-
ing on helping others is Sigma Chi.
Last year, the Pitt chapter began fol-
lowing the national, traditional

“Derby Days.” Derby Days is a -

fund-raising program for Sigma
Chi’s' national philanthropy, The
Wallace Village for Children. The
fraternity plans fund-raising parties
and anything—goes events that other
Greeks participate in. “We have a lot
of fun,” said newly initiated Bob
Brooks. “And at the same time, we
help needy children."

Leadership is another attribute
that fraternities claim to promote.
“Greeks promote healthy competi-
tion along with the opportunity and
training in Jeadership,” said Inter-
Fraternity Council "President Craig
Strauss. '

Laura Ferlan, Panhellenic presi-
dent, agrees. “Greeks provide ideals
for the productive individual,” said
Ferlan. “They in turn make us
stronger as an organization.” For
example, Luke Kluchko, of Delta
Tau Delta, is the Student Govern-
ment Board’s president. Peter
Petropolous, of Theta Chi, is the
allocations committee chairperson.

Sororities take a different
approach in helping their freshmen.

Most sororities have mandatory.

study nights at least once a week.
“We want our women to be strong

, responsibility.”

intellectually, as well as socially,”
said Alpha Delta Pi sister Betsy
Kearns. “We're not ‘Daddy's girls.’
We have to learn to survive on our
own." These study nights are moni-
tored by the pledge “mom” or scho-
larship chairperson.

Sororities’ scholarship programs
include special activities. For exam-
ple, Delta‘ Delta Delta has speakers
come to discuss topics such as self-
defense, drugs‘ and alcohol. “O_ur
tutoring service is also an added
plus,” said “Tri-Delt” sister Jannine
Cushman. “We provide strong aca-
demic support for our sisters, espe-
cially when they need help.”
Another sorority, Kappa Alpha
Theta, gives special awards to those
with the highest QPA in each class
and to the most improved sister.

Fraternities also have study
nights, but they are not as strict as
the sororities’. Delta Tau Delta
offers $50 scholarships to high
school‘ men with a high QPA. “Our
fraternity has high standards,”said
“Delt” brother Tim Knoll." “This
gives them an incentive to keep those
standards.” Deltas have also won
several awards for their academic
achievement. .

Sigma’ Alpha Mu, Pitt’s newest
fraternity, also has high standards of
scholarship. Most of their members
are pre-med, pre-dentistry or engi-
neering students. “We really try to
emphasize good academic integ-

rity,” said “Sammy” president
Adam Plotkin.
Even though Greeks provide

“ideals of leadership,” scholastic
guidance and opportunities for
friendships, do they offer enough of
that moral development in the right
atmosphere? \ —

Fraternities have become ‘known
for their drinking and wild parties.
Freshmen, naive about college life,
want to be a part of the action, and,
at the same time, can have problems
breaking family . ties. Fraternities
have the inﬂuential power to make
or break a freshman’s morals.

“We try and help freshmen forget
their homesickness by partying,"
said Alpha Epsilon Pi brother Bob
Stephens. “They mature faster at
college.”

A Tim Knoll, a Delt, disagreed. “We
try to dispel those fraternity stereo-
types. We’re brothers first. Your
drinking habits are

And sorority women?

“Women don’t want an organiza-
tion that is shallow,” said Kappa
Alpha Theta ‘vice president Chris

us grow as individuals. Our personal
life is just that — personal. Our sor-
ority does not decide our lives, they
just support our individuality.”

out on my own, and yet my sisters
are always there when I need them,
no matter what.” _
Obviously, drinking does go on at

fraternities and sororities, and the

members don't deny it. They do,
however, try to justify the alcohol.
“When we have mixers, it’s differ-
ent from going to a bar," explained
Alpha Epsilon Phi Diane Lefkowitz.
“Mixers have more clean-cut conno-
tations. You don’t have to drink.
The alcohol isjust like pretzels — it’s
there if you want it, but you’re not
obligated to drink. If you do drink,
your fellow sisters will make sure
you get home safely." .
FIJI Bob Kramer echoed he

' thoughts. “That's BADD's purpose.

Watch out for yourself and for each
other.” ‘

Most Greeks agree that drinking
is a personal decision and not a peer-
pressure obligation.

“Greeks have mixers and other
activities that let you meet men and
women,” said Lefkowitz. “It gives
freshmen a positive way to builda
social life. You don‘t have to go to
bars to meet people."

But Greek life is not for everyone.
In fact, the Pitt Greek population is
small compared to most other uni-
versities. One problem is Pitt's pop-
ulation of 80 percent commuters.
The other is the Greeks’ inability to
convey their ideals to their perspec-
tive 'rushees.

In order to combat this, the Pan-

hellenic Association revised their v

open-house sessions. During their
old system, women simply met sor-
ority members at their houses or
suites. Now, rushees will not only get
to meet the sorority members, but
each sorority also has a theme in
Greek life, like scholarship, history,
philanthropy and so forth. Each sor-
ority will be represented at every sor-
ority house or suite.

“We were losing rushees after
open house,” explained Pam Matz,
overall rush assistant. “This way, all
sororities have to work together to
help each other. We want to educate
our rushees, not turn them off.” IFC
will provide male escorts for the
women after every open-house
party.

Still, explaining “Greek” is diffi-
cult to do during rush. Formal rush
for sororities basically lasts two
weeks; fraternity dry rush is one
week, and wet rush is two weeks.

This time period is too short for ’

rushees to really know the members.
For example, one sophomore,
Marty, who wishes not to be identi-

. ﬂed, went to two fraternity rush par-

ties at FIGI. He was given a bid after

the second party and he declined the‘

offer. “First, I didn’t even know
them,” he commented. “The pres-
sure to make me join without even
knowing me turned me off.” This is a
common complaint for ex-rushees.

“It's a Catch-22 situation,”

‘ explained Strauss. “Fraternities and

rushees have a short time to decide,
but both have to make tough deci-
sions. Rush can’t last forever." ‘

Homesickness is avoidable  

A 1 By Lisa Podrat.

Staff Writer

All of a sudden,.here you are
—— alone in a new city. A new face
at a new school. You are sur-
rounded by unfamiliar people,
intimidating professors — eve-
ryone is a stranger. You couldn’t
wait to get here, and now you
can’t wait to go home for
Thanksgiving.

-“Homesickness is something
you see when a person is making
a new transition,” said Dr. Kath-
leen Peoples, a psychologist with
Pitt’s counseling center.

When a person is feeling
homesick, according to Peoples,
he may be unwilling to mingle
with others, as well as feel shy,
sad and depressed. The depres-
sion that he feels, however,
should not be confused with a
clinical depression. , A deep
depression and homesickness are
two different things.

“The general features of home-
sickness are a little bit different‘
than a major clinical depres-
sion," said Peoples. “If a person
is in a major depression and he
returns home, he isn't going to
feel any better; whereas the per-
son who is homesick may feel
some relief when he goes home,
because ‘he’ is back in a familiar

surrounding.”

Homesickness has two com_—
ponents: “An actual missing of
people you are attached to back
home, and a missing ofthe famil-
iarity itself,” said Peoples.

To some, a simple solution
might be to go home on week-
ends or whenever possible. Peo-
ples cautions against this.

The main thing to

keep in mind is first to
concentrate on people
instead of activities, and
don’t be afraid to talk
about your feelings.

Thus, according to Peoples,
the first couple ‘of weeks of
school are crucial for making
new friends and familiarizing
yourself with a new life style.
Going home on a regular basis
only makes you ‘miss out when
the new contacts are being made,
as well as making it harder to
make friends when you finally
decide to settle into your new life
style. - . - .

Peoples recommends that a
new student givehimself a couple

of weekends, even if he is bored,
to sit around with other people
and be bored. Or sit around with
other people and talk about
being homesick so that he can
form new bonds with others, so
that there will be some people at
school that are familiar to him.

“I think that’s really impor-
tant,” she said.

A word of caution: Don't
overdo it. Some people might .
have a tendency to overindulge
themselves in activities. This can
be just as bad as- sitting in your
dorm room for a whole semester.

“With any kind of reaction
where peoplemight be sad, some
people withdraw into them-
selves, go home and forget the
whole thing,” said Peoples.
“Other people try to distract
themselves to the extent that
they’re not aware of their feelings
and they may over-extend
themselves.”

The main thing to keep in
mind is first to concentrate on
people instead of activities, and
don’t be afraid to talk about your
feelings. Chances are that a lot of
those people you will meet will be
feeling the same way.

If talking to friends'doesn’t
help, your resident assistant and
the counseling center are trained
to help you deal with adjusting to
the new setting.

' He entered the churchand sat.

quiet, as the petty cares of the
day dropped away, he sought
to reach God directly.-Another
seeker rose andspoke of love,
of human cruelty and injustice,
of Jesus, of other peacemakers,
of things she was deeply moved
to say out of her sense of com-

enfolded the words, and in the

_his thoughts cleared, his con-

And afterwords, everyone

fancy, forthright, fun, affordable

By Nadia Moritz
Features Editor

Thereare no fashion rules for fall

‘ ’85. For men and women both,

according to Gimbels fashion direc-'
tor Karen Pedro, everything and
anything goes. The looks span from
the unisexual classical preppy to

if _ paisley stockings for women, plaid

trousers for men, and British riding
dresses and loud‘ '60s prints for
both. Last year's lean jeans and
fisherman sweaters are being com-
bined with alpine and animal-faced
sweaters, stirrup pants, Raj-inspired
jewelry, pastel fake furs with layers
of scarves and lots of bright berets.

The jackets are fitted and over-

-sized, the skirts are short and long,
the trousers are baggy and fitted,
and the shoes include everything
fron pancake ﬂats to the highest
spike heels.

“The designers used to dictate the
trends; now the customer is dictating
to the designer," said Pedro. “Now
the customer can use her individual-
ity to work for her and have fun.

‘College is the perfect place to have
fun with fashion.”

One of the top trends on college
campuses this year, according to
pedro, is neo-prep. Yes, neon is out
and neo is in. This means the return
of the classics -— wool skirts in plaid
patterns, cardigan sweaters, oxfords
and plaid trousers and bow ties for
men —- but in vibrant colors.

“Color is the most important
word in fashion this year,” said Bar-
bara Driscoll, Kaufmann’s assistant
fashion director.

The focus is gem tones — emerald
green, ruby red, sapphire blue and

amethyst purple.

“This is really going to work for
college kids. By presenting the clas-
sics in an upbeat way, they can be
pratical and fun at the same time,"
said Pedro. “Neo-prep offers a
whole new look and individual feel-
ing, and the classics can be used year
after year.“

According to Pedro, the same
neo-prep trend became popular in

“In college, the look is
loose‘-‘and easy, with lots
and lots of layers. _It’s
mix-n-match and a lot of

fun. ”

—— Barbara Driscoll
Assistant Fashion
Director. Kaufmann ’s

Europe last fall. Most fashion trends
take a year to move from Europe to
the United States and then last for
two years. College campuses are the
primary targets .for such fashion
tides. , i" '

“These fall trends are easv to
adapt to college, because they are
fun and within student financial
capabilities,” said Pedro. “Plus, the
stuff that is popular can be bought in
the department stores, special col-

lection shops or in thrift stores.”

Thrift store clothing, according to
Pedro, is a trend that has largely
inﬂuenced the fashion industry.

“The thrift stores are very trendy,’
Pedro said. “They are the ones that
started the whole oversized coat
look, big blazers, baggy trousers.”
Gimbels has even opened its own
“Antique Boutique” in response to
this trend.

“The thrift shopping trend began

5

with young people looking for a

cheap way to dress stylishly,” said
Driscoll. “A lot of the designers have
begun styles that resemble that
look.”

The worn natural fibers — wool,
leathers, stone-washed jeans —— that
have been popular for the last year
and will be again this fall are also the
result of thrift store_inﬂuence.

“Everyone wants everything to
look old  worn, so that the minute
you put it on  it looks lived in,"
said Pedro.

MTV has also been an inﬂuential

fashion force, whether it’s encourag-

ing the blac-k-lace stockings and
multi-bracelet Madonna look, the
stock-tie blouses of Prince or the
rugged Levi’s look of Bruce
Springsteen. '

“MTV has a definite effect on
fashion,” said Driscoll. “We have
MTV screens throughout our junior
section. That’s how important the
store feels it is.”

Some other trends in the 1985 fall
fashion line-up include the new Vic-
torians, Nordic-know-how and the
eclectics. .The new Victorian look
emphasizes a classic look —— challis
skirts, print blouses, riding skirts
and blazers, pearls and even riding

The Nordic look features stirrup
pants, jumpsuits, print denim in
paisleys and ﬂowers, turtlenecks and
fake furs in red, pink and pastels.

The eclectics include patterned
sweaters and sweatshirts, ’60s-
inspired prints and denim jackets.

Denim, according to Driscoll, is
especially popular for men this fall.

“With the Bruce Springsteen
surge, Levi's’ have really made a
comeback, both the jeans and the
jackets,” she said. Combining Levi's
with more dressy wool blazers will
also be R, an emphasis for men’s
fashion. . . « ‘

For women this fall, a more femi-
nine look is surfacing. Jackets are
more fitted with rounded shoulders,
dresses are cut closer to the body

with an accent on waistlines and V

wide rib cages. Blouses are also more
popular and available in evening
sheers, prints, vest looks and long-
torso overblouses.

All of these looks can be com-
bined into a “layered look” —— a print
blouse under a ﬁsherman sweater,
under another fisherman sweater,
under a ﬂannel, for example. Other
layer possibilities may include a pair
of stirrup pants. under a skirt, and

matched "with a sweater and thick, .

ﬂannel over-shirt, many colorful
scarves, and a beret.

“In college, the look is loose and
easy, with lots and lots of layer. It’s
mix-and-match and a lot of fun,”
said‘ Driscoll. “This is the time when
you can really enjoy fashion. So be
creative, and be yourself.” /

Great Scot

i__Great Scot, at 413 S. Craig St., is a .
‘ restaurant organized around the

unifying theme .of “American
Bou'n‘ty."«Great Scot's owner, Jack
Camphire, chose a decor and menu
that pay homage to country, life and
regional cooking. .

Camphire and chef Pat Clark
adapted Great Scot’s theme from
The American Bounty restaurant at
the Culinary Institute of America in
Hyde Park, N.Y. A period of service
at The American Bounty serves as
an internship for chefs who graduate
from the institute.

The Culinary Institute of America
is a prestigious school that has grad-
uated many fine chefs. Pat Clark is
one of them. Clark works with his
assistants to change the menu com-
pletely every two weeks.

At the time of this writing, Great
Scot’s menu had some very appeal-
ing dishes for the culinary tourist.
Among its appetizers was a dish of
lightly battered, fried shrimp that
came with a sweet and tangy sauce
concocted from coconuts, marma-
lade and horseradish. This sauce

made the dish unique. It lent to the
, shrimp an unusual blend of sweet-

ness and piquancy.

Great Scot offers a sampler of
three kinds of soups. In the sampler I
tasted, there was a cold soup made
with fresh cantaloupe and cream, a
spicier variety made‘ with red
peppers and sausage, and a thick
soup made with black-eyed peas and
beef. All three were excellent. The
chilled cantaloupe soup was surpris-

weak spot was the bread. It was
spongy, crustless and tasteless.

For dessert, I chose peach cobbler
out of a field of three or four other
dishes whose names had the same
homey appeal. The cobbler was a
large, rich affair made from fresh
peaches,‘ vanilla ice cream and a
crust with a touch of whiskey and
nutmeg in -it.

Clark and the other cooks appre-
ciate the periodic menu change

because they get a chance to _try new

things. Changing menus every two
weeks has its drawbacks, though.
There are sometimes a lot of lefto-
vers. Great Scot donates the extra
food to the East End Co-operative
Ministry, which distributes it at an
East Liberty men's shelter.

Great Scot is crowded during
lunch and from about 6 p.m. until
the kitchen closes (ll p.m. Monday

through Thursday, midnightgn Fri-V

day and Saturday). The business is
almost 18 months old and has done
very well, according to manager
Cindy Kleindl.

“We even survived the hole in the
street,” she said, referring to the
seemingly endless repairs made to
pipes beneath Craig Street. “We
have entertainment on Friday and
Saturday now, a female vocalist who
sings jazz and oldies."

The crowd at Great Scot is mostly
over 30. According to Kleindl, they
get some families’ and a smattering
of students. The restaurant is also
popular with Craig Street shoppers
and visitors to Scaife Gallery and
Carnegie Museum of Natural
History.

Prices are inexpensive to moder-
ate ($7-I3) for entrees. The portions

ingly ﬂavorful.

The entrees, for the most part,
reﬂect America's changing eating
habits. The menu abounds with fish
and pasta dishes, although steaks
and chops are usually available. My
choice was cod Norwegian style,
baked in apple cider and garnished
with onions and bacon. It had a sin-
gularly sweet aroma and ﬂavor.

The cod was accompanied by a

large portion of browned, spiced.

potatoes. There was also a side dish
of steamed fresh broccoli, cauli-
flower and carrots. The meal’s only

, Dan Momman/ The Pitt News
are adequate, and there are salaIs
and sandwiches on the menu for
those desiring lighter fare. The sand-
wiches are prepared well and
included slices of fried sweet potato
and cole slaw, but I don't recom-
mend them because of their price.
Other items on the menu are more
interesting and ultimately a better
deal. , _

My compliments go to chet'Clark
and his cooks. My questions go to
the establishment's decorator. It
doesn't say “American Bounty" to
me. It says “Welcome to a fake Eng-

Oriental House

Restaurant at 4519 Centre Avenue_
in Oakland is deceptively demure.

The exterior is inconspicuous —— a
brick—red wooden exterior and a
hand-painted sign. Inside, the walls
are plain, white and without the tra-

ditional dragon decorations or

ornate Oriental danglings. The
tables are small and square, the
cloths brown vinyl, the napkins
white cloth and the dishes undeco-
rated white ceramic. The two rooms
are quiet and private, and at any
time of the day there are no more
than four of the 30 tables filled.

The extravagance begins with the
food. It is prepared in a multitudeof
styles and served in generous pro-
portions at affordable prices — and
it's terrific.

The menu includes over 20 Chi-
nese and Vietnamese luncheon plat-
ters, and over 50 Chinese and 32
Vietnamese dinner selections -— egg
roll appetizers, sweet and sour
chicken, shrimp and crab, chicken lo
mein, egg foo young, fried rice and
chop suey. The prices range from 95
cents (egg drop soup). to $6.95
(shrimp and broccoli with garlic
sauce), averaging $5 an order and
including family platters and prices.
Everything is available to take out.

I ordered the Mongolian beef with
vegetables ($5.25) and the chicken
chop suey ($4.50) from the Chinese
menu. The meal began with a pot of
Chinese tea, and the food was served

. within 15 minutes with an endless

amount of rice and complimentary
chop stick lessons.

The Mongolian beef‘ included‘

lean, tender strips of beef, mixed
with sweet onions, cabbage, celery,
lettuce and turnips, _ and covered
with a sweet beef broth.

The chicken chop suey is a mix of
vegetables — white onions, celery,
bamboo shoots and bean sprouts —
with splinters of chicken. _

"1-ror_n the Vietnamese menu, the
pork with Oriental vegetables is
especially good. Large strips of pork
are mixed with peapods, onions, let-
tuce, turnips, water chestnuts and
baby corn, and served in a light
creamy sauce. The Vietnamese
dishes are prepared with the custo-
mer requesting the spiciness on a
scale of one to 10.

The service is overly attentive, the
portions are overly filling and the
meal is always finished with the tra-
ditional fortune cookies.

PrImanﬂ’s

“Every city has one or two unique
things about it that visitors seek out.
In Pittsburgh one of the unique
things is experiencing a Primanti
Brothers’ sandwich,” said Pete Lan-
dis, one of the three owners of Pri-
manti Brothers Restaurant in
Oakland. ’

Anybody will tell you that there
are plenty of restaurants in Oakland,
but as Pete Landis points out, there

 

is something unique about 3803
Forbes Avenue.
“I've never considered Primanti’s

as a resturant,” said Pam Foster.‘
“I've been going to the one in the.

Strip [District] for years, and now I
come to this one. It’s a place where I
come to have fun and meet people.“

“Actually," her friend Kelly Sie-
bold clarified, “the cheesesteak
sandwiches get us here, and we come
back because we always have fun.”

Great food, fun and plenty of peo-
ple to meet — that's what you'll find
at Primanti’s.

The atmosphere is casual. Stu-
dents in jeans, yuppies, local
workers (white- and blue-collar),
students, sometimes a professor or
two, and more students. If they're
not too busy, you can tell the cook
your order while you find a seat.'In
Just a couple of minutes, one of their
famous sandwiches will be brought
to your table.

Primanti’s sandwiches are not
made; they are created. Seventeen
different kinds. Hot (or sweet) sau-
sage, knockwurst, deluxe. double

-688. bacon and egg, cheesesteak

(No. 2 best seller), cappicola and
cheese, genoa salami, pastrami — all
the way down the list to roast beef.
But what makes them so special?
Every sandwich comes with “the

works”: tomato, potato fries and.

cole slaw. Extra cheese and egg are
available, and all sandwiches are
served on fresh Italian bread.
Once you've experienced one,
you'll understand why Primanti’s
Restaurants have been written
about in the New York Times, Pitts-
burgh Post Gazette, Sports Illus-
trated, USA Today and countless
travel and air magazines. The aver-
age thickness of a Primanti’s sand-

wich‘ is two and one half to three
inches!

If a sandwich sounds like too
much for you, side dishes can be
ordered. Why not try Primanti’s
“almost famous" hot chili bowl?
Watch out though —— one customer
warned that it's “hot, very hot!”
Other side dishes include vegetable
soup, potato fries, cole slaw, whole
kosher pickles, Italian bread, wing
dings with sauce or a hearty beef
stew. For the diet-conscious, a small
or large antipasto salad can be pur-
chased. In the fall pasta will be

added to the menu.

Primanti’s will fit right into your
budget. Sandwiches are priced
between $2 and $2.50. Side orders
range from 35 cents to $2.50. To
quench your thirst, soft drinks,
juice, hot chocolate, tea (hot and
iced), coffee and beer are served. I.C.
Light, Golden Lager, Stroh's and
Miller are available on tap. Forty-
two other varities of beer are also
available for take-out.

If you're an early bird in Oakland,
then do not miss breakfast at Pri-
manti’s. Two breakfast specials are
served ‘along with their breakfast
sandwiches. These sandwiches are
combinations of ham, bacon, egg
and cheese, and can be served with
or without “the works.” Breakfast
runs between $1 and $1.95.

“Give customers a good value for
their money and prompt service,”
Landis said, “and they'll come
back."

This philosophy has made Pri-
manti Brothers No. 1 since 1933,
when the original Primanti brothers
opened the first Primanti Brothers’
Restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip
District. In the '60s, the family sold
the restaurant to Jim Patrimos, but
the name and menu (with a few addi-
tions) are the same as they were over
50 years ago. The Oakland location
was opened on October l, 1984.

“I eat here at least once a week,"
said Abby Polonsky of Shadyside,
“I’m addicted to Primanti’s
sandwiches."

Primanti’s is open 7 a.m. to 2 a.m.
Monday through Wednesday, 7

-a.m. to 4 a.m. Thursday through

Saturday, a perfect place for late-
night munchies. '

The Original Hot Dog Shop

Partly because of the atmosphere,
but mostly because of the food, the
Original Hot Dog Shop is an Oak-
land landmark. It looks something
like a collision between a bus station
and a lunch counter. But, somehow,
out of that wreckage arose a United
Nations of beer and the best place in
Oakland to eat and run.

For 25 years, the Original, or the
“O” as many people call it, has been
famous for its hot dogs. The Origi-
nal’s large, lean, juicy franks which
snap when bitten are Pittsburgh’s
top dog.

In l960,- when Sid Simon, the
Original’s owner, replaced the auto
parts store on the corner of Forbes
Avenue and Bouquet Street with a
hot dog shop, Forbes Field wasjust
across the street. Now, Forbes Field

, is only a memory and the Pirates

may be packing their bags, but the
“_O” is doing better than ever.

Hot dogs are still a substantial
part of the Original’s business. Moe
Simon, Sid’s ‘brother, claims that
they sell “thousands, literally thou-
sands” of the dogs every week. He

neither would he disclose the source
of their frankfurters.

number sold may i be well-kept
secrets, but appreciationof the Orig-
inal’s food is certainly a public
affair. At any given time, the Origi-
nal’s customers form an accurate
sample of the different types of peo-
ple found on Oakland’s streets. Busi-
ness people, students, . workers,
children and denizens of the local
night spots gobble and quaff here
democratically.
would have loved this place.

People don’t just come to the “O”
for hot dogs. Behind the counter,
above the grill and all the way to the
back of the shop, hand-lettered signs
advertise the Original’s menu. Balti-
more crab cakes, egg rolls, chicken
Parmesan, submarine sandwiches
and kielbasi are some of the
offerings.

The Original sells french fries,
too. At the rear of the shop, jammed
behind a tiny counter, banks of deep
fryers line the wall.

“We sell more french fries than
anyone,” Moe Simon claimed. “We
use peanut oil because it doesn’t
have an aftertaste. We use nothing
but Idaho p’otatoes. We peel them;
we cut them; we sell tons of them in a
week. Hell, we go through -50 cases
of Heinz ketchup in a week.”

Orders of french fries come in
three sizes. The largest of the three
costs $1.91 plus tax. Moe pulled out
a scale and weighed the raw potatoes
that make up the largest order. It
weighed two and one quarter
pounds. “Wejust pile them in there,”
he said.

The Original has l68 brands of .

imported beer sold for take-out
only. The list begins with Aass brand
beer from Norway and doesn’t stop
until it hits Zipfer from Austria.

From Blatz to Schlitz, American
beers are also well-represented. In
six packs, quarts and 40-ounce bot-
tles, the Original keeps them cold for
take-out. It even carries such spe-
cialties as Grape Duck and Pink
Champale. _ '

The Original keeps Miller,
Michelob, Stroh’s, Molson, Hei-
neken and I.C. Light on tap. These
brands are sold by the glass or the
pitcher. The mugs are frosted and
the beer always tastes fresh.

To better serve its patrons, the
Original is spreading out. Workmen

are remodeling the storefront next A

door (where the Wooden Keg used
to be). Sid Simon stood with a wire-
less telephone stuffed V into his
trouser pocket observing the work-

men in his new addition.

“We got to a point where either we
move on or go down," he said ges-
turing with his thumb like a Roman
emperor deciding a gladiator’s fate.

“We plan to have seating in here
for 150 people. We’re going to
extend our french-fry section and
have a large horseshoe-shaped coun-
ter in here. We want to sell pizza by
the slice and a few othernew items,”
Moe said.

The Simon brothers are also
remodeling the apartment above the
Original. Moe said, “We can’t tell
you what we’re going to have up
here, but it will be something differ-

_Moe predicts that the remodeling

will be ﬁnished by the middle of Sep-

tember. The Original is the oldest

restaurant in Oakland and still‘
growing. It is successful because the
owners ‘haven't allowed the volume

food. The fare is plain; the prices are
low. The Original Hot Dog Shop is

highly recommended to anyone who '

can appreciate the beauty of humble

C. J. A Barney's
 . .8: Hemingway’s

Barney Silverman has a simple
‘ formula for success. “We try to serve
good food at a‘ good price,” he said.
Silverman and fellow entrepre-
neur, Charles Nucci, have used this
formula since 1969, when they
opened C.J. Barney’s at 3909 Forbes
Ave. Fourteen years later, they com-
bined again to open Hemingway’s at
3911 Forbes Ave.
Though close in proximity, C.J.’s
and Hemingway’s have different

‘atmoshpheres and customers.

“We've tried to cater to all age
groups,” Silverman said. “At C.J.’s,
we get the 21-to-24-year-old crowd
that enjoys drinking and dancing. At
Hemingway’s, we’re trying to attract
the 25-and-over age group, the pro-
fessionals, graduate students and

_ professors, as well as the college
kids.”

More than just a place to drink
and dance, C.J.’s offers a wide var-
iety of food. Its hamburgers have the
distinction of being named after dif-
ferent cities. Whether you prefer the
“Sharpsburg’s" cheddar and bacon,

. or the “Pittsburgh’s” sauteed mush-
rooms, peppers and onions, C.J.’s
' has 17 burgers from which to
choose. For those with heartiei
stomachs, C..I.’s offers the “Cancun-
” burg,” topped with a spicy blend ol

13:9 ,‘:_=‘__"(V'_ “' 1 . . _ , '. '1 ,'(o_ 1":

burritos are ﬁlled with beef, chicken,
beans and vegetables, or a combina-
tion of all four. C..I.’s also has tortil-
las, enchiladas and ﬂauntas. All
dishes can be covered with spicy sau-
ces, guacamole and sour cream.
These sauces make ‘the Mexican
dishes anything but bland.

Another reason people enjoy eat-
ing at C.J.'s may be the cozy atmos-
phere. The walls are filled with
antique mirrors, paintings and
stained glass. Pots and pans hang
from posts above the booths, and an
old/ barber's chair puzzles new
patrons as they walk in.

Although C.J.'s decor borders on
tackiness, the customers do not seem

' to mind. Rex, a Pitt chemistry grad-

uate who wishes to remain anonym-
ous, approves. “C.J.'s has a rustic_
style which represents a degenerat-
ing industrial Pittsburgh,” he said.
“The atmosphere’s very interesting,
and the food and drinks are great. I
come for the food more -often than
the beer, particularly the Mexican
food.” .

From quiches to fried ice cream,

C..I.'s menu has the variety to please _

many different kinds of customers.

C.J.’s lively college atmosphere
contrasts with Hemingway’s quieter,
more relaxed tone. Hemingway's
quaint interior attracts professional
people from Pitt and the health cen-

-ters who prefer a quiet drink or fine

dining after work.

Hemingway’s most unusual fea-
ture, however, is its cultural endow-
ment. Poetry readings are held every
Tuesday night at 8:30, and writers

Hemingway’s one night a week to
read or hear original poetry.

“It’s a ‘chance for young writers
like myself to try out new material
on a very receptive, yet critical
audience," said Donna Lynne, a
graduate student at Pitt. “It’s also
great just to listen to the work being
unveiled. It’s a learning process, but
it's also a lot of fun.”

Debbie Bankert, Hemingway’s
manager, explains the reason for the
name of the establishment. “Hem-
ingway was a masculine, outdoors-
type of author. His writing is
excellent and he still seems macho.
That’s the kind of image we want to
portray.”

However macho Hemingway’s
image may be, the customers do not
seem to drink as much as the people

‘ at C.J.’s. The business-suited profes-

sionals, mixed with the Bohemian
poets and writers, provides for a
strange atmosphere. The scene is
often quiet, sometimes subdued.

“We‘re very happy with the food
end of it, but the bar hasn't been as
successful. The graduate students
and professionals don't seem "to
drink as much as the kids. We have
John Puckett to attract the younger
people,” Silverman said.

Puckett plays acoustic guitar and
features folk, blues and pop music" at
Hemingway's every Wednesday and
Thursday night. On Friday and Sat-
urday, jazz is performed by the
Kenny Blake Trio.

Drinks are served in the back
room during the poetry readings,
but most of Hemingway’s customers
come for the food. Dinner entrees
include such elegant dishes as
chicken marsala and steak poivre,
and a long list of appetizers and des-
serts. Hemingway’s also features six
pasta dishes, each with its own
creamy sauce.

Ruth Kosanovich, an MBA stu-
dent at Pitt who works at Allegheny
General Hospital, sums up her feel-
ings about Hemingway’s: “The other
places are too noisy and crowded.
After school or work, I like to relax
and have a quiet drink, and maybe
some good food. That’s why I come

here.”

Niko ’s Gyros

“I would put up my gyro against

anyone else’s in the Pittsburgh‘

area," boasts Steve Thomas, owner
of Niko’s Gyros. Niko’s offers tasty
gyros at affordable prices Monday
through Saturday from ll am. to I
a.m.

Niko’s is located in the 400 block
of Semple Street in Oakland and is
somewhat nondescript in appear-
ance. A faded sign spelling “Nikos”
gives you the only clue that you have
arrived at the restaurant‘s location.
Even though it is somewhat off the
main thoroughfare, it is well-worth
seeking if you are tired of the usual
fast food fare.

The first thing you notice when
you sit down on one of the counter’s
nine stools are the pictures of sports
celebrities. Over the grill are pictures
of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, and
other photos of Dan’ Marino line the
paneled walls. Speaking of Marino,
Thomas said, “He used to eat here a
lot; he was probably our richest cus-
tomer besides Bill Fralic.” .

Thomas, who bought Niko’s
about a year and half ago, waves to a
man walking in front of the restau-
rant. Although he is not familiar
with the customers’ names, Thomas

said that he knows most of their-

faces and jokingly calls his clientele
“middle-class lowlife.” Most of his
customers are college students and
neighborhood regulars.

The gyro, a Greek concoction

enjoyed a boom in popularity in

recent years, is a blend of beef, lamb
and pfta bread with a distinctive fla-
vor. “What sets us apart is our secret
recipe for our sauce,” said Thomas.

One of Niko’s specialties is the
gyroburger. An ordinary cheese-
burger is transformed into some-
thing special when it is topped. by
gyro meat and special dressings.
Served-in pita bread, the gyroburger
is a delicious combination of Ameri-
can and Greek fast foods.

Thomas stressed that all the ingre-
dients he uses are fresh, and almost
every item on his menu — including
his soups — is homemade. All items
are priced from $1 to $3 and a gyro
with fries costs about $3.50.

' “Our philosophy at Niko’s is to
keep our prices down and our por-
tions large," said Thomas. Niko’s
average order of homemade, fresh-
cut french fries weighs over one
pound and costs only 85 cents.
Although gyros make up-the major-

' ity of his business, Thomas adds,

that, according to Thomas, has-

Dave 8: Andy’s

The first thing you notice about
Dave and Andy’s Homemade Ice
Cream shop is the aroma. It greets
you about a half-block before you
even enter the store —- the scent of
freshly pressed /wafﬂes, chocolate
and fresh fruit. ,

The second thing you notice
about Dave and Andy’s is the line.
During the summer, it stretches out
to the sidewalk. And no wonder.
Dave and Andy’s ice cream tastes as
good as it smells. '

The ice cream ﬂavors change reg-
ularly offering standards like choco-
late and vanilla and unusual treats
like teaberry and sweetcream. The
best part about Dave and Andy’s,
however, is the diced Oreo cookies,

‘ Snickers candy bars, Reeses Peanut

Butter Cups, M&Ms and pieces of
chocolate, dried fruit and nuts that
can be mixed into any scoop of ice
cream.

The price of a single scoop of ice
cream is, on a regular cone, 94 cents;
on a wafﬂe cone, $1.20. An add-in
brings the price to $1.80.

Co-owner Andy Hardi explained
that Dave & Andy’s ice cream is
richer than supermarket brands
because it has a higher butterfat con-
tent. It contains 14 percent butterfat,
while others contain 10 to 12
percent.

Over-run is another factor that
makes Dave & Andy’s ice cream bet-
ter. Over-run is the amount of air
pumped into ice cream. Store
bought brands usually have the legal
limit of 100 percent. Dave & Andy’s
has only 20 percent. The less over-
run, the more filling the ice cream.

In addition, the store is not con-
servative when it comes to adding
the berry ingredients to the ice
cream. For instance, one quart of
fresh raspberries is used to produce
five gallons of ice cream. Since the
store uses only fresh berries, ﬂavors
come and go according to price and

_ availability of the fruit.

The ice cream is all freshly made.
If Hardi or co-owner Dave Tuttle
makes ice cream one morning, it is
usually gone by that evening.

Other items include milk shakes
($1.90 and $2), sundaes ($1.50 and
$1.90) and chipwiches ($1.60).

The store, located at 206 Atwood,
definitely gets the ice cream lover’s
stamp of approval. From wherever

you are in Oakland, Dave and
Andy’s is wo_r_th the walk.

— By Lisa Gordon

Pace ‘s

If you want to relax with a cone of
homemade ice cream or just have a
pleasant lunch, Pace’s, 420. S. Craig-
St., is the place’ to go,-.

Fashioned after a similar store in
Boston, Pace’s was the first ice
cream store in Pittsburgh to feature
“put-ins,” toppings that are mixed
into Pace’s six-ounce scoops of ice
cream. Almonds, cashews, peanuts,
Oreo cookies, coconut, Heath Bar
candy, Snickers candy and malt are
popular put-ins.

The ice cream itself, though, is
considered Pace’s specialty. Accord-
ing to Peter Swartz, the store’s man-
ager and son of the owner, Pace’s
has its own recipes and makes all the
ice cream on the premises. Swartz
said they try to use imagination
when creating new ﬂavors and are
willing to try anything.

Pace’s has so many different ﬂa-
vors of ice cream — banana, choco-
late, peanut butter swirl, lemon
sorbet, apple pie, Hawaiian punch,

   

  

almond — that the ﬂavors must be

V rotated.

Pace’s also offers open-air cafe-
style seating. This gives its custo-
mers a relaxing place to sit and eat in
a European-type setting. Most of the
quaint tables and chairs are inside
on a lower level deck where the food
is purchased, but there are also a few
tables and chairs outside on sunny
days. This layout.makes Pace’s dif-
ferent from the typical ice cream
store.

the ice cream, Pace’s also has an
assortment of luncheon foods such
as ham, turkey, roast beef, tuna and
chicken salad sandwiches, all for
around $2.95. Pace’s also has ‘soup
and chili, cheese sandwiches and
sloppy joes for about the same price.
The drinks include such items as
espresso, cappuccino, coffee, tea,

Goodies  

Goodies, located at 121 Oakland
Ave., is the place to go for candy of
all sorts: fudge (chocolate peanut, -
peanut butter, rocky road and just
plain chocolate), penny candy (lolli-
pops, candy cigarettes, bubblegum,
B-B Bats, shoestring licorice and
even imported Gummie Bears), nuts
(pistachios, cashews, pecans, choco-
late-covered nuts and chocolate-
covered raisins) and ice cream
(vanilla, Swiss chocolate, Kahlua,’
Bailey’s coffee, Oreo vanilla and
mint chip). __ _

Although Goodies has probably
one of the largest assortments of
candy, chocolates and ice cream in
the" Pittsburgh area, it prides itself
mostly on its penny candy.

“People are surprised‘ that there is
still a place which sells penny candy
for a penny," said Valerie Graziano,
manager of the store and fiancee of
Goodies‘ owner, Chris Warman.

Goodies was opened about a year
and a half ago because, according to

_ Graziano, she and Warman thought

that Oakland needed a store that
sold not only candy but fudge, nuts
and ice cream as well.

They were right. People ranging
in age‘ from two to 65 frequent

. Goodies, looking through the store’s

wooden barrels and glass canisters
for candy and nuts to satiate their
need for sweets. The most com-
monly purchased items in this turn-
of-the-century style candy store,
according to Graziano, are fudge,
ice cream — available on homemade
cones — and, of course, the penny
candy. You have to be the epitome
of cynical, boring Scrooge not to
have fun in Goodies. A

As far as prices go, Goodies does
indeed sell a lot of penny candy,
although the actual prices range
from about 3 cents to 35 cents, and
the fudge and nuts are sold by the
pound. Ice cream cone prices range.
from about 90 cents to $1.35. ‘

The Decade

The Pep Boys began playing at
l0:30 pm. The crowd, which began
coming in about an hour earlier,
greeted them with applause and a
smattering of cheers. It had been a
long wait. The room had been com-
pletely dark a minute before, but
now the spotlights snapped on and
the screech of a harmonica sounded.

There was the tinkle of glass and
the sloshing of poured beer. But as
the lead singer took the stage — the
same stage that had been tramped
upon by The Police, Cyndi Lauper
and The Pretenders — there was a
ring of cheers.

The Decade, a long, black build-
ing at 223 Atwood Street, has been
around for 13 years. It used to be
called the Pizza Pub and was much
smaller. Janet Chepes, part-owner,
bought it because she “thought we

would enjoy it."

The bar is set up in three con-
nected rooms. The middle room IS

where the band plays. There is a '

stage covered with ﬂowered carpet-
ing and equipped with four huge
speakers at one end, and a board
boasting a guest list of all the rockers
who have performed here and the
dates they played at the other end.
The list reads like the weekly Top 10.
The Police. U2. The Romantics. Pat
Benatar. Cyndi Lauper. Joe Jack-
son. Zebra.

All of these performers played
there when they were relative
unknowns. Shortly after they played
at The Decade, however, their songs
became hits. Coincidence?

“Probably,” said Chepes, “We

2 just happened to be on the East

way 111.] at” /umurmpsl A‘puaA4

 

 

Coast when they were touring, and

their agents thought they had some
talent before they started out and it
would be a good time to go on tour."
‘- It is not a coincidence that the
bands played there, though. Dom
DiSilvio, the bar's promoter, is the
man responsible for all these live
bands, and he works hard to land the
right hand. He operates through
Electric Factories, and a lot of the
bands he books are from the Pitts-
burgh area. Many of them, like the
Pep Boys, you probably will never
hear of again. Some, like The Police,
you will hear of, shortly after they

 

    beware of offensive linemen and

enjoy.

play there. In any case, live bands

are rare in Oakland. Only The

Decade and Graffiti have them.
“We decided to book bands,"said

DiSilvio, “because we enjoy live;
V rock-n-roll. ”

Thus, The Decade's nickname;

“the Home of Rock-n-Roll," can be‘

seen in large black letters on the
building's side and occasionally on
the backs of the waitresses’ T-shirts.
“Pound for pound,” said DiSil-
vio, “we are the biggest lounge in the
country for live entertainment.”

The other two rooms are domi-_

nated by a large, rectangular bar and
a L-shaped bar, respectively. There
is a large-screen TV in one corner
and a video game in another. Para-
chute lining hangs lazily around the
rafters above it all. The bar is aver-
age  $1 for mixed drinks and beer,
$1.25 for whiskey. There is no happy
hour, although from 4 to 7 every day
the staff sets out snacks. ,

Although there is plenty of room
for dancing here, nobody does. The
people that come here are older col-
lege students and people just out of
college. Most of them come here
regularly.

“I come here because I know eve-
rybody, all the bartenders, and it’s
fun," said Laura Swiderski, a Pitt
student. “Also, it's the only place
that plays rock-n-roll."

“l've been to allsthe bars in Oak-
land,” said Thomas C. Evans, a loyal
patron. “But I like this bar the best..
It has good bands and is full of
friendly people  it's like a big fam-
ily here."

So, if you're down by Atwood and
have a few hours to spend, stop by.
You might be pleasantly surprised.
Last November, a bunch of people
were very surprised. DiSilvio rates it

as his most memorable moment at

 

the Decade. Chepes wasn't around
that night but she knows the story
well.

“It was a Thursday night. When
he first came in, nobody recognized
him, and he just stood and watched
the band that was playing. Then
somebody recognized him, and eve-

rybody, including the waitresses and -

staff, asked for his autograph," she
remembers. “Finally he got on stage,
and Bruce Springsteen accommo-
dated the crowd by doing a few
numbers. He left by the back door."

Springsteen's likeness is embla-

zoned on an American flag on the
bar's outer wall, which you can see
him in when you walk past. Maybe
the night you're there having a few
beers and waiting for the Pep Boys
or whoever to start, Cyndi Lauper or
Sting or Pat Benatar will show up.
Maybe ‘even Bruce will drop in
again. After all, it is the home of
rock-n-roll.

Mojority stockholder
behind the Decode

She certainly doesn’t fit the typi-
cal image of a restaurant and lounge
owner. She is a 21-year-old senior
communications major at the Uni-'
versity of Pittsburgh. And Gina
DiSilvio, partner in the D_ecade Res-
taurant and Lounge, doesn’t _even
like the word. She'd prefer to be
called “majority stockholder.”

“It's in my name,” said DiSilvio
from across a table at the Decade.
“But I really don't feel like I'm the
owner.”

Since the time Gina was about 10
years old, she has worked as a wai-
tress, a bartender, a cook, and has
helped out at Pitt parties held at the
Decade on Saturday mornings
before football games.

“I've done everything,” she said.
“But I think I like promoting the
best." _ ’

I he Decade is also Oakland's‘
“Home of Rock-n-Roll.” Gina has

.hosted such performers as The

Police and Stevie Ray Vaughn but
rates meeting Cyndi Lauper as her
biggest thrill. ‘

“I was sitting at home, and my dad
called and said we should come
down to see this act,” she
remembers. “We stood right in front
of the stage and watched her, and
afterwards I met her back in the kit-
chen. I asked her about her plans,
and then, about a month later, I
heard her song “Girls Just Want To
Have Fun" on the radio. I think she's
the greatest.”

The Police were a different story.

“I was skeptical at first," she said.
“When a band, any band, comes up
and asks to play, I'm always skepti-
cal. I looked at their reviews and
listened to the tape they gave us and
they didn't sound good. When I saw
them live, though, I was impressed. I
thought they were good. And then I
heard their song “Roxanne” on the
radio a little bit later."

.Of course, starting in the fall,
there might not be time to watch all
those bands. She'll be pursuing her
degree and perhaps graduate school.

“I hope to go to graduate school
for fashion retailing somewhere in
New York City," she said. “My dad
and I went up to visit some of the
schools, and I really fell in love with
New York."

She plans to leave for New York
right after graduation and possibly
beginrwork at a large, retail outlet.

But what about the bar?

“I'm not sure I want to run the
bar," she said, smiling nervously. “I

don't think that's what my father .

would like to hear ..."
“Of course, _it‘s my favorite bar,"
said DiSilvio. “It’s not a fad bar, real

‘crowded one ‘night and no one in it

the next. The Decade is a constant
— with constant customers.

“More college people come -here
now, also. I think it has to do with
the lowering of the cover charge.
They just couldn't afford it before,
but once they start coming, they
always come back.” .

And for this reluctant “majority
stockholder," that is good news.

— By John Zaphyr’

Caleco’s

As I rounded the corner at Forbes
and Oakland Avenues, I saw that the
big, orange cat on the sign that
hangs outside Caleco’s was smiling
at me. It had a big grin, full of white
teeth, and I swear it was looking
right at me.

When I got below it, I could see
why. The place was jammed. I could
see people milling around inside
through the front windows. They
looked like they were having a good
time. I started to go in, but a guy
sitting on a stool who looked just
like the Cheshire cat in “Alice in
Wonderland” stopped me.

“Sorry, pal. Can't go in there," he
said, with a certain satisfaction.
“Too many people. You'll have to
wait until somebody comes out."

The night before, there were no
giant crowds or waiting lines. No
cover charge either. Caleco’s is one
of the few bars in Oakland that
doesn’t have a cover charge. I just
walked in. The place was brightly lit
and the tables that line three of the
walls were filled with groups of
extremely happy, young business

types. A large pink rectangular bar :

stood in the center of the place and I

sat down. It was “decorated with

 
  

hanging plants and blocks of stained
glass, and the counter top was sur-
prisingly clean. Top 40 music was
playing from a jukebox. Later in the
night there was someone manning a
stereo system and taking requests.
I ordered a beer and paid 75 cents.
Mixed drinks cost $1.25, and the
bartender said that the best mixed
drinks are iced teas. During happy
hour, which is from 4 to 7 p.m. each
night, a pitcher of Genesee costs
$2.50 and drafts are 50 cents.
Thursday night was a different
story, however. I was beginning to
feel like Bob Uecker in that Lite Beer
commercial, staring in at all those
people having fun. When _I was

finally al1owed_in, I couldn't believe '

how the place had changed. There
were people everywhere. I tried
questioning some of them, but
nothing sensible would come out.
Just something about MBA night.
MBA night? I asked the bartender,
who was being swamped with empty
beer cups, what was going on.

“The MBAs graduated today,”
she said. “They're all over the place.”

Then I understood. I nodded and
sat in the corner away from the cra-
ziness. I looked at the dance floor
and saw more chaos. People weren't
dancing — they were hopping and
stomping. One business type was
jumping as high as he could to Billy
Idol's “Dancing With Myselfl"

Even with the invasion of the
MBAs, it still wasn't too bad. You
could walk, you could breath and it
didn't smell like flat, warm beer and
human body odor. It still locked
new and the people looked like they
were having fun.

As I was leaving, I saw a waitress
(who I had talked to the night
before) coming in with a date on her
night off. If waitresses, come there
when they aren't working, it has to
be a fun place.

COMMUTER’S  

Commuter
Association

The Vice-President for
Student Affairs, in recogni-
tion of the needs of the
undergraduate commuter
constituency, intiated
the Commuter Association
to enhance the quality of
campus life for commuters.
The Association represents
the needs, interests and
concerns of commuters,
provides programs and ser-
vices that fulfill unad-
dressed needs, conducts
research and evaluations to
ensure commuters full and
equal access to University
facilities, services and pro-

grams, provides pertinent

and timely information of
concern to commuters and
cooperates in the efforts of
the Commuter Resource
Center to serve commuters.
The Commuter Association
is located in room 509 of the
William Pitt Union. Stop in
or call 624-3731. __ ~___ __
The ”Commuter Journal”
was designed by the Com-
muter Association to pro-
vide pertinent and timely
information of interest to
commuters and to inform
the University community,
of the issues and concerns
that affect commuters. The
Association's Journal is pub-
lished monthly in the The
Pitt News. Any commuting
student is welcome to sub-
A mit articles or ideas for

upcoming issues.

There is no sense comb-
ing the campus grounds to
look for your friends when
you can just as easily and
more effectively leave them
a message at the Messasge
Center. Located in theCon-
course Area, it provides a
convenient mechanism for

4 students to communication
within the commuter
community.

The Commuter Associa-
tion, is aware that there is
always room -for improve-
ment. We want your sug-
gestions on what services .
and programs you "would
like to see in the future, or
how to improve those that
already exist. The Sugges-
ti_on Box is located in thc

Light Rail Transit

The Stage 1 Light Rail
Transit (LRT) System is a Port
Authority Project designed to
preserve remaining South
Hills trolley routes while pro-
ducing significant transit
improvements (as identified in
the map below.)

Now in final stages of con-

struction, the project is being
carried out at an estimated
cost of $559 million defrayed
by grants from the Federal
(80%), State (16 2/3%), and
Allegheny County (3 1/3%),
governments.

The 10.5-mile main line con-
sists of two major segments.
One is the former Mt. Leba-
non/Beechview trollely route.
This 5.8-mile trackway is
being totally rebuilt to include
new trackbed, separate
inbound-outbound tracks,
drainage, electrical facilities,
bridges, retaining walls, street
crossings and passenger
stations.

Two sections will gain their
own underground right-of-
way—in Downtown Pitts-
burgh and portions of

Dormont and Mt. Lebanon. A

The separation of trolleys
from other vehicles will
benefit motorists alike by sub-
stantially reducing traffic con-
gestion and travel time.

The second major construc-
tion zone extends 4.7 miles
southward from Mt. Lebanon
to the Bethel Park—Upper St.
Clair area. This will result, for
the first time, in a direct rail
link between Downtown
Pittsburgh and South Hills
Village. It also will give the
intervening community of
Castle Shannon regularly
scheduled all-day service,
insted of peak hours only.

Patrons of the LRT line will
experience smooth _and com-
fortable rides on 55 new Sie-

mens/Duwag vehicles (LRVs)‘

being assembled in Allegheny

County, augmented by 45.

PCC trolleys being rebuilt
locally.

' Two new bridges have been
constructed along the ‘south-
ern 4.7-mile strech. The first
eliminates a rail street crossing
at Connor Rd. and improves
safety by carrying automobiles
over the transit tracks. The
second is a transit bridge span-

ning Ft. Couch Rd. along a new '

length of track connectingvthe
Shannon/Drake line to a new
passenger station South Hills
Village.

Adjacent to South Hills Vil-
lage Station is a new 50-acre
Rail Center consisting of a
maintenance and repair shop,
a storage yard for the mixed
trolley and LRV fleet, the sig-
nals and communications
headquarters for monitoring
vehicle routing, and a commu-
ter parking lot with 200 spa-
ces, which will be expanded at
a later date. This example
replaces the 80-year-old shop

and yard at South Hills Junc- _‘

- tion near Mt. Washington.

Relocationg’ the yard; to the
..'route’s and improves "effi-

ciency for the start-up of oper-
ations in the. morning and the
return of _,vehicles at ‘night.

Trackway ‘work Chas been _

parceled outin shorttrack sec-
tions in order to accelerate
progress and to keep bid prices
low enough to encourage local
builders and suppliers to par-
ticipate. Some‘ 60‘ different
‘companies, most of them
based in the Pittsburgh region,
have been awarded construc-
tion and procurement

constrants.

Constructon began in 1980
and has proceeded from both
ends toward the middle. Three
miles of trackway at the south-
ern end,
South Hills Village to Castle
Shannon Junction, have been
completed and were restore_d
to service in April 1984. At the
northern end, Downtown
subway work is expected to be
finished early in 1985 and will
be followed by a program of
systems testing and ' driver
training. PAT plans to begin
subway operations Mid-1985.
At this time, all trolleys will be
running beneath the streets of

Downtown Pittsbutgh rather

than on the surface.

Trolley service was discon-
tinued in April 1984 to permit
accelerated construction of the
intervening 6.4 miles of track-
way. Buses are substituting
for trolleys until construction
of the entire route is com-
pleted. At that time, LRVs will
be used for operations and
trolleys will be relegated for
use on the Overbrook trolley
line. - ‘

Bouncers are tough and tender

By Nadia Moritz
Features Editor

Mark Rawls is not afraid of any-
thing. But for a 6-5, 265-lb. ex-
Purdue football player, fear is not a
common emotion. And for the pri-
mary peace-keeper of Oakland’s
most turbulent after-hours hangout,
fear is not a practical emotion.

“Why should I be scared?” asked
Rawls, who is one of three doormen
who work at The Original Hot Dog
Shop. “It's a physical job and I'm a
physical person. The job asks me to
keep peace, and that is what I do.”

Jim Fuller, the 6-4, 330-lb. door-
man at the Decade, doesn’t mind
admitting fear. “Sure I get scared. I
don’t like to ﬁght. I’m not a physical
person. I’d rather talk. When I go
home after having to ﬁght someone,

. I can’t sleep. I lie awake all night

feeling guilty."

Jim and Mark are two of many
men in Oakland dubbed with'the
disdained yet respected title of
bouncer, or, as many bars insist,
doorman. In any case, this is the
man hired to end the barroom
brawls, eject the overly intoxicated
and uncover that penned-in date on
your under-aged driver’s license.
Many times he stands as the biggest
obstacle between you and a terrific
night on the town. But are these guys
really as tough as they look?

Jim Griffith is. He is the 6-2, 250- -

lb. bouncer at the Sanctuary.

“I ‘ve been intimidated a few times,
never scared. Fighting is a chal-
lenge,” said Griffith. “When I was
little, I was clumsy and people made
fun of me and picked on me a lot.
Now I’m getting my revenge. I don’t
start fights, but I don’t walk away.”

Tom Crombe can walk away. “I
don’t want to fight —— it’s not me,”
said Crombe. He works the door at
Caleco’s. “Why would you want
someone to beat you up?" And this is
one of the first responses when one
considers the occupation of bouncer
— why would you want someone to
beat you up?

Fun is what Griffith had in mind
when he decided to inquire at the
Sanctuary. “I just stopped in and
asked if they needed a bouncer. I
always wanted to be one  it
sounded like fun,” said Griffith. “I
get to fight and get paid for it. I
would be here anyway, so I may as
well do the same thing and get paid
for it.”

Tom Johnson, who works part-

» time at Peter’s Pub, does it for the

social aspects. “You get to meet a lot
of people and really know them,”
said Johnson, who recently gradu-
ated from Pitt. “Sometimes they talk

to you just to get in, but you end up

getting to know them.”

Crombe does it to pay his tuition.
He is a sports management major at
Robert Morris College. “I need this
job to make ends meet.”

The same with Fuller. Although
he has worked at the Decade full-
time for two years, he began his
career as a bouncer at the Original
out of necessity.

“I answered an ad that said you
had to be at least 6-5 and weigh 250
lbs. I had an unsteady job and I had
rent to pay,” said Fuller. “I didn’t

 

enjoy the job, but the money was
goodf’ ' .

Fuller admits that he is much
more content bouncing at the
Decade, where he has to break up
only one fight about every three

V months.

“At the ‘O,’ the atmospherewas
constant tension. A lot of times I was
really scared,” said Fuller, who
claims that during his two years as
security guard at the Original, he
was hospitalized seven times with
lacerations from broken beer bottles
and bites on the face. But his most
frightening experience was with
three irate women and a sawed-off
baseball bat.

“I asked them to leave and then
they came back in to get me,” said
Fuller. “What could I do? I couldn’t
hit them. Luckily I got hold of the
bat and then the police came. I kept
the bat as a souvenir.” -

Employment at the Original has
been a different experience for
Rawls. It’s his third month and he’s
only had to physically remove three
people so far.

“This is my first experience as a
security guard, but I find it very
exciting and challenging,” Rawls
said,'who graduated from Purdue
last spring and is presently pursuing
a career in professional football.

According to Rawls, working at
the Original Hotdog Shop is differ-
ent from acting as a doorman in any
other establishment. .

“The uniform distinguishes me
from a bouncer and establishes me
as a security guard,” said Rawls.
“With the title of security guard
comes more diplomacy. My last
resort is violence.” ‘

For Jim Fuller, violence is also a
last resort.

“We can usually resolve things by ,

talking,” said Fuller. “Plus, when it
comes down to action, it’s not fair.
These people are usually intoxicated
and smaller than me. There is no
contest."

At the Original, Rawls has the
sole responsibility for physically
breaking up ‘fights and removing
nuisances.

“They tell me who goes, and I
remove them,” said Rawls. "Pm
careful, and if someone gets hurt try-

ing to hurt me this place will back me
100 percent.”

Doormen (bouncers) are allowed
to defend themselves, according to
Lt. Richard Roup of the Oakland
police. “But if they cannot easily
physically remove someone, they are
supposed to call the police.”

Bouncers are not covered by any
special legal clause, according to
Roup, and they are held responsible
for their actions.

“Occasionally a bouncer will take
too many liberties," said Roup, “but
most of the bouncers have been
there a while and know how to han-
dle the people.” .

Taking too many liberties does
not seem to be the issue this year
with Oakland’s bouncers. Unques-
tioned power is not something that is
common among them.

“I don’t consider myself a power-
ful person,” Rawls said. “I know I'm
a big person, but at the same time, I
don’t try to use my bigness to physi-
cally intimidate people. I give them
the same respect they give me.”

“Power? Not really,” said John-
son. “If I want to let them come in,
they can. And if I don’t, they can’t.
But I have job restrictions that allow
me to make these decisions  if you
have a legal ID, you're in.” _

Checking legal identification is
perhaps the most feared function of
bouncers, and no doubt it is the
preoccupation of aspiring young
drinkers who are under the Pennsyl-
vania legal alcohol consumption age

of 21. But what does the carding

situation look like from the other
side?

“People shouldn’t get so offended
when we have to card them,” said
Crombe. “I’m 28 and I get carded
everywhere I go. You have to ask. If
they get busted, it’s your, fault.”

Griffith’s approach is less strin-'

gent. “I don’t let them in if they
have a valid identiﬁcation  unless
they are really good-looking,” said
Griffith. “I have fake identification
myself, except mine is better because
I know what to look for.”

“I did the same thing when I was a
kid,” Fuller said. “I feel bad. I don’t
like to run these people down —

especially pretty girls. But it's my job .

—— I have to do it.”

Acres of solitude await students at Schenley Park

By Oliver W. Holmes

"...lt might be easily maintained
that the true object of all human life
is play. Earth is a task garden;
heaven is a playground. "

— G.K. Chesterton

In pursuit of that ideal go stu-
dents, surgeons, senators, Scorpios,
Sagittarians, Sikhs and Scots in
skirts, saris, sandles and shades to
swim, skate, ski and socialize in a

such places have some to call them
—— “historic landscapes.”

The most frequent use enjoyed by
the college crowd, at least that seg-
ment well-situated enough to avoid
steady employment, remains sun-
ning on Flagstaff Hill, that slope of
green that sits tauntingly within
your view during one o’clock class in
the Fortress of Darkness (Cathedral
of Learning).

A passing yuppie might look upon
the daily summer parade of young
people — blankets in hand — with

The park and its patrons have
exhibited an amazing tolerance
for every imaginable form of
recreation and culture, not to
mention every preference for
social mating and behavior.

sanctuary rich in scenery and right
for sketching, singing or a moon-
light serenade.

They go to Schenley Park.

For those perceptive enough to
discover that the words “Pitt's cam-
pus” are as incongruous as “Beirut’s
neighborhoods,” there lies an
expanse of greenery and solitude.
There waits Schenley.

With its acres of tree-lined walk-
ways, running trails and biking
paths, Schenley Park represents the
nearest and nicest recreational area
available to Pitt students —— if they
don't mind sharing it with the esti-
mated 150,000 or more people who
use the park on a fairly regular basis.
With each of them comes a different
reason and way to enjoy the 96-year-
old facility — or, as the keepers of

nostalgic eyes and mistake it for a
meeting of social signiﬁcance. But
today’s eager achievers carry no
such baggage. Their idealism
demands only an even tan and a
stimulating round of What-are-we-
doing-tonight?’s.

Schenley Park rose out of the soot
and stufﬁness of the late 1800s,
thanks to the generosity of Pitts-
burgh land heiress Mary E. Schenley
and the ambitions of political ma-
chinist Edward M. Bigelow. The
former christened the park in name,
the latter in the sculpted metal of a
statue that guards the park to this
day.

Bigelow’s quest was to give Pitts-
burgh what many of the large cities
of the East — Boston. Philadelphia,

New York — had offered for
decades: A lush oasis to which the
industrialists and cultured could
escape, leaving the immigrant
masses behind to smolder and suffer

through another post-industrialist

American day.

Today, the sons and daughters
and grandsons and granddaughters
of those who suffered through Pitts-
burgh‘s post-industrialist period fill
Schenley along with visitors from
nearby cities and distant nations.
Nowhere does the diveristy of the
city’s population — or that of the
university — display itself more
nakedly than in Schenley.

The park and its patrons have
exhibited an amazing tolerance for
every imaginable form of recreation
and culture, not to mention every
preference for social mating and
behavior. In the past month alone,
the park has been home to such
diverse happenings as a Cinema-in-
the-Park double feature of “Horror
Hospital” and “Psychomania,” the
Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix fea-
turing classic cars as old as the park,
and just last week, the first annual
Renaissance Fair, a three-day cele-
bration of Elizabethian food, music,
dance, wizardry and revelry, includ-
ing an evening performance of
Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.

Nestled in the park and a regular
stop for visitors is the Phipps Con-
servatory, offering seasonal displays

of ﬂoral beauty and a welcomed,

break from the blahs that come with
every winter. For those who prefer a
different type of scenic beauty, the
overlook provides a great night view
of the downtown skyline.

Games of all types, for all sizes,
are a constant at the park. Flagstaff
is home to the erudite who call Pitts-
burgh’s “real” college — Carnegie
Mellon U niversity — home. The
particular appeal of such non-sports
as Hacky-Sac and ﬂying radio-
operated biplanes finds company
there. especially, in fall and early

parking space.

On ‘a sunny summer day in Schenley Park, the
main thoroughfare IS not an easy place to find a

spring when the bikini-fest has
covered up and gone home.

Tennis rivals running as Schen-
ley’s most likely pastime. Lighted
courts — requiring city residence
during peak times — draw novices
and country-club pros all spring and

. summer. Runners have their choice

of dirt and cinder tracks as well as
the winding paths that lace the park.
For those in need of more

untouched natural surroundings,
Panther Hollow provides a surpris-
ing "hideaway. The hearty and
adventursome_will ﬁnd this secluded

.area the perfect cure for those’

cement and 7-Eleven blues.

Most importantly, nearly every-
thing contained within the park
lacks that which college students
fear most —— a price tag. It’s free. It’s
close. It’s Schenley.

Phipps Conservatory:
a tropical paradise

By Nadia Moritz
Features Editor

For all of the pluses of Oakland —
the savvy social spots, the academic
atmosphere and the fast-paced
excitement of city living, there is a
time when even the most hard-core
city dwellers need to retreat into the
solitude of nature —— a place with the
luxuries of life that Oakland over-
looks — air, quiet, greenery —— a
place like Phipps Conservatory.

It is located in Schenley Park at
the heart of an industrial center.
Amidst mounds of grey concrete
and faceless" crowds, Phipps Conser-
vatory is 2.5 acres of indoor tropical-
rain forests, deserts, international

-gardens, herb gardens and waterlily
ponds. - Phipps offers more color,

fantasy and solitude than a dollar .

can buy anywhere else in Oakland.
“Students use the conservatory

for so many different purposes,”

said director Edward Vasilcik. “It’s
an inexpensive date, a place to bring
your parents. Students use it as pho-
tographic subject matter, for sketch-
ing, or just to get away from
Pittsburgh."

As one of the largest publicly
owned conservatories in the coun-
try, Phipps was begun — like almost
everything else in Pittsburgh — by
large donations from the area’s steel
magnates. In this case, the benefac-
tors, Henry Phipps and Andrew
Carnegie, gave $100,000 in 1892.

Most of the original plants were
purchased at the Columbian Expo-
sition in 1894. Presently, the estab-
lishment contains 13 rooms and nine
greenhouses. The conservatory’s
architecture is Victorian, and most
of the plants are grown on the
premises. .

The Palm Court is the first and
largest room, containing various

tropical growths including the date
palm, the traveler's palm and the
ﬁshtail palm, as well as life-size ferns
and other crawling, climbing, color-
ful jungle ﬂora. The room used to be
an alligator pit; however, the anim-
als refused to stay in the pit, and the
visitors were a little uncomfortable
stepping over them.

Other fantasy-inspiring rarities at
Phipps include the waterlily room,
complete with life-size lilies, banana
trees, hemp and papaya. The desert
room contains round, ﬂat, snaking
and blooming cacti that are so beau-
tiful you have to touch them. Lastly,
the orchid room smells of vanilla
and glows in colors of orange, yel-
low, purple and pink.

For jet-setting horticulture buffs,
there is a host of international
gardens. The Japanese garden, for
example, is graceful and quiet with
strips of hanging, beaded blooms, a
tea house, lanterns and a ﬂoor of
ferny growth. The French garden is
formal and stark with circular,
carved hedges, Italian cypress trees
and rows of geraniums. .

Another feature of Phipps Con-
servatory is its seasonal shows. The
spring show ‘features 10,000 tulips
alone, plus hyacinths, narcissi, lilies
and roses. There is also a Christmas
show, and in autumn, the Fall

-Flower Show displays chrysanthe-

mum garden designs
greenhouse.

The conservatory also serves as a
public information source for horti-
culture and botany as well as ama-
teur and professional gardening.
Workshops are conducted daily to
answer public questions concerning
house plants. Visit Phipps
whether it’s to nurse a sick house
plant, to impress a date, to create
your own fantasty world or to hide
from the world you’re in.

The Pitt News. Orientation issue 30,”    .

reuide offers best of the burgh
at a reasonable expense    

By Nancy Quick
Assistant News Editor

Pittsburgh’s Renaissance II has

-brought new but expensive sophisti-
cation to restaurants and shopping
areas downtown. It would seem that
only the upwardly mobile can afford
to be entertained outside of their
livingrooms. '

But Dorothy Miller,-author of the
“Poor Man’s Guide To Pittsburgh,”
thinks otherwise. In its fourth year
of publication, Miller’s guide pro-
vides inexpensive alternatives to
expensive entertainment, and ways
to enjoy the city's best for less.

“This year has seen big changes in
Pittsburgh, its skyline and the qual-
ity of city life,‘’ Miller says in the
guide. “Pittsburghers are discover-
ing old urban joys, dining outdoors,
the pedestrian pleasures of the big
new Renaissance II buildings, plazas
and the excitement of a new enter-
tainment boom. It's a beautiful city
full of great things to do and to see.

Most all of the “great things”.

listed in the “Poor Man’s Guide”can
be had for .less than $15. Miller
included what sheconsiders worth-
while entertainment, and focused
her reviews on how to make the most
of an experience.

' Mainly an eating guide for people
restricted to a low budget, the “Poor
Man’s Guide" contains a section on
“Sunday Brunches,” and one on
“Early Bird Specials,” both of which
Miller claims are the most inexpen-
sive ways to sample the cuisine at
some of Pittsburgh’s finest
restaurants.

“Sunday brunches are the latest
thing at many of Pittsburgh’s restau-
rants,” she explained. “The all-you-
can-eat option is popular with
young people and very reasonably
priced. More and more Pittsburgh

restaurants are also offering big sav- V

ings on early dinners, generally from
4 to 6 p.m. A diner can visit the Park
Schenley between 4:30 and 6:30 p.m.

and spend as little as $7.95 for a full
dinner.”

Also included in the “Poor Man's
Guide” are restaurant reviews,
arranged alphabetically and indexed
by price. Many of the restaurants
reviewed can serve two people for as
little as $10. Others, listed under
“Fillings,” run up to $15.

Miller said she has attempted to
inform diners about various restau-
rants in hopes of eliminating the
guesswork, thus allowing the diner
to enjoy the restaurant.

“All of the restaurants in the guide

are worth visiting,” Miller said. “I

‘Window shopping
Is a great, Inexpen-
slve way to enjoy the
CITY-”
— Dorofhy Miller,
author

chose each one because of its special
or unusual atmosphere, and I
included suggestions on when to go,
what to order and what to wear.”
For the student shopper on a
limited budget, Miller put together
reviews of some of Pittsburgh's pop-
ular shopping areas and included
them in the guide’s restaurant review
section. Each review contains a brief
description of the place, and sugges-
tions on the best and most unusual
things to see. '
“Window shopping is a great,

inexpensive way to enjoy the city,” _

said Miller. “If you stop atone of the
restaurants reviewed in the guide for
lunch, you can makea whole day out
of it and spend very little.”

The “Poor Man's Guide" also
contains a section entitled “Pitts-
burgh After Dark," a complete list-
ing of restaurants that are open late,
take-out places and night clubs.

Included in the latter part ‘of the list
are jazz rooms, piano bars, dance
and rock clubs, and one country
music club. ’
“This is a selective list of some of ;
the new, and some tried and true,
local favorites,” Miller explains in
her guide. “Places that are making
Pittsburgh an exciting town after
dark. Only after-10 hours are given
in this section.” +
The newest addition to this year’s
“Poor Man's Guide” is the “I Love
Pittsburgh" sightseeing guide. It is
an illustrated section that lists tours,
famous addresses, a guide to the
Renaissance II constructionpand ai

calendar of favorite annual events. 9

The “Visitors Special” tells of “S”
Easy Ways to Fall in Love with the
City.” Most all of them, like the rest"
of the attractions in the sightseeing
guide, are free.

“I would sugguest that new stu-.
dents use the sightseeing guide first,”

Miller said. “It's a wonderful, free‘ '

way to discover Pittsburgh for the
first time.”

The “Poor Man’s Guide To Pitts-'
burgh” is sold in a package with the
“Pittsburgh Walking Map And
Guide,” a clear, well-constructed
map showing all of the streets and
buildings downtown. On the other
side of the downtown map is a map‘
of Oakland, including both the Pitt
and Carnegie-Mellon campuses.
Miller worked with Rosemary Par- ‘
lak ‘to create what she calls “the
definitive map of Pittsburgh.”

“We decided that a city containing
so many things to see and to do
needed a good map," Miller
explained. “We put together the
kind of informative map that, until
now, one has only been able to find
in resort towns." ‘

“The Perfect Pair,” walking map f
and guide, is available at Pitt’s book-
store for $7.95. A “Pittsburgh Plea-
sures 1986 Calendar" will be
available September 15 at the book-‘
store for $8.50.

 Vol.8 No. 1 TA:-gust so. 1985

By Michael Fay

R.E.M. is the acronym for rapid eye
movement, the dream state of sleep.
R.E.M. is also a band — an American
rock band with a sound as big as New
York City and as personable as a
small southern town. It's music with-
out instructions. Sounds and images
strung together in a way that is as
ambiguous or meaningful as your
mood.

If you listen to their latest record-
ing, Fables of the Reconstruction, you
might recall the Byrds, the Velvet
Underground or perhaps even Hank

v

 

Williams or Roger Miller. But you
won't necessarily miss them. Where
R.E.M. crosses their paths, they also
leave them behind. As is true with

any meaningful creation, their music

is most profoundly‘ influenced from
within. Bill Berry, the band's
drummer, agrees that good music
can't be forced.

”We didn't have a plan,” Berry
remembers. ”We just wanted to meet
girls and drink free beer at parties;
man, that was it.”

Is there any motivation more suit-
able for the forerunner of America's
new breed of independent bands?

”Yeah, we got together in such a
low key atmosphere that it [talent]
just didn't matter. We got together
just to have fun. We did ’God Save the
Queen’ the first time we played,"
Barry said.

Those days have passed, and the
band has accomplished more than
most. They've released three albums
— Murmur, Reckoning, and Fables — and
the ep Chronic Town with International
Record Syndicate (IRS). They have

also received endless criticial praise .

from college newspapers as well as
from more prominent publications
such as Rolling Stone and the more

A practical guide to fun in Pittsburgh

52By Steve Morrison

No doubt that even this early in the
school year, your incoming student
enthusiasm has already begun to
wane and the first tugs of that awful
depression over "How the hell am I
going to stay entertained?” have
started pulling at you. Well, we'd like
to say, "Fear not. This is a fun town.
You'll have a ball." Unfortunately, we
can't. Keeping this in mind, we have

-_ ome good news and some bad news:
First, the bad news:

There is not a hell of a lot to do in
Pittsburgh.

Second, the good news:

There are a few things.

In this humble little article, we will
attempt to ' illuminate these few
things and aid you in your sociopathic
fun-seeking.

Sports — There are a lot of sports
at Pitt and in Pittsburgh as a whole. If
you like sports and nothing else, you
will be fine. The Panthers usually win

The only "regular" movie theater
near Pitt ‘is the King's Court on
Forbes Avenue. Since it is near a col-
lege — or several colleges, rather —

the movies shown there are generally '

somewhat hipper than at theaters
elsewhere.

The "in" place to go for movies is ‘

the Pittsburgh Playhouse on Craft
Avenue. It has a different flick each
night, it's not expensive, and you can
always go there on a date when you
run out of ideas. The only thing is
that a lot of high school kids go there,
too, and if there's a Monty Python
film being shown, there will be nerds
behind you quoting the dialogue in
shrill voices. ’

If you're feeling adventurous or
consider yourself "bohemian," a good
place to go is Pittsburgh Filmmakers
on Oakland Avenue. They show a lot
of interesting and unusual stuff.

 

Theater (or Theatre) — Well,
you've missed all the good summer
productions. You've especially blown
it if you haven't seen at least one pro-
duction by the Three Rivers Shake-
speare Festival, which is one of the

best Shakespeare troupes south of
Ontario. But there is still plenty of
good theater around Pittsburgh.
There is the Pittsburgh Public Thea-
tre, the Pittsburgh Laboratory Thea-
tre, The Metro and many others.
Some are worth sniffing out, others
are not.)

 

Music — O.K. Now we come to it.
If you're anything like us, going out
and having a good time almost always
involves music. We happen to love all
kinds of music, so this category will

be subdivided into the following cate- ,

gories: Classical, Jazz and Rock.

Classical —— The Pittsburgh Sym-
phony is one of the finest in the
nation, they say. Pittsburgh has some
very nice places to hear "good" music,
notably Carnegie Hall and Heinz
Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony used
to be conducted by the renowned
Andre Previn, but he left to go to Los
Angeles under mysterious circum-
stances. They can still bant out a tune
or two, though. ~

Jazz — Surprisingly, there is a good
deal of jazz to be heard in Pittsburgh.
Much of it took place in the spring
and summer, but you can still hear

NW5

Sept. 12

M.C.

good jazz if you look. The Balcony in
(ugh) Shadyside has jazz every night.

Rock ‘— Pittsburgh is not
renowned for its rock scene. Aside
from the usual national acts that play
the Civic Arena and the Syria

\ Mosque, people in Pittsburgh just

don't seem to want to hear original
music. There are plenty of bars with
bands that play Top 40, R&B, etc., but
not too many that playoriginals. The
exceptions, though, are worth the
trip.

The Decade, on the corner of rock-
n-roll in central Oakland, is the clos-
est thing we have to a "legendary"
night spot. Acts like U2, The Police
and Cyndi Lauper played there
before they hit it big. And of course,
we all know about Bruce showing up
there last fall after eating "O" fries. It
gets national acts like Guadalcanal
Diary and Suzanne Vega‘, as well as
great local groups like Joey G. and the
Brick Alley Band.

The Electric Banana, loca_ted way

out on Bigelow Boulevard, is the .

archetypical punk bar. Run by a
charming couple known affection-
ately as Johnny and Judy Banana, the
Electric Banana showcases local
bands (not just punk), as well as
regional bands and some national

ones like the Minutemen. Don't.

expect fancy cocktails, but don't
expect to get slashed either; it's not
that punk. Remember, this is Pitts-
burgh.

R.E.M. WITH THE THREE
O’CLOCK '

August 13, 1985

Syria Mosque

By STEPHEN MORRISON

Q R.E.M. did not disappoint its
 growing legion of fans at their
> recent Syria Mosque concert.
Michael Stipe and company
roared through a 20—plus song
set that will certainly be remem-
bered as one of the best shows
Of 1985.

Stipe, sporting his newly-
bleached, ultra-short hairstyle
and exhibiting a surprisingly
uninhibited stage personality,
mesmerized the audience. Even
though the Mosque was a fur-

 nace on the hottest night of the

year, the band displayed an
infectious exuberance that kept-
the vast majority of the crowd
dancing and having a good‘ time.
Opening with a powerful ren-
dition of "Feeling Gravity's
Pull" (from their latest lp, Fables
of the Reconstruction), R.E.M. .
wasted no time showing off a
bold, muscular sound that
should forever dispel the label
"wimpy" that had plagued their
earlier career. There was
nothing wimpy about Stipe's
1.3,’. growling vocals or his command
of the stage, whichcombined I
the playful approachability of
The Smiths’ Morrissey with the
manic, driven intensity of the
late Ian Curtis of Joy Division.
Equally compelling onstage
was guitarist Peter Buck, whose
seemingly boundless energy
kept him moving while he exe-
cuted his complex guitar work.
'The . band performed a
healthy sampling of songs from
their three albums, notably

i——— Life and how tolive it

"Second Guessing," "Pretty
Persuasion," "Sitting Still,”
"Life And How To Live It" and
the single "Can't Get There
From Here," as well as "Box-
cars," from the ep Chronic Town.
Rounding out the set, as always,
were some of R.E.M.'s inspired
covers, like the Velvet Under-
ground's "Femme Fatale,"
Creedence Clearwater Revival’s
"Have You Ever Seen the
Rain?" and a tongue—in-cheek
version of Brownville Station's
"Smokin' in the Boys’ Room."

Two long sets of encorescon-
cluded the evening. By the time
R.E.M. played their last song, a
stormy ”Radio Free Europe,”
the crowd had forgotten the
heat and left in good humor,
satisfied by a terrific show. '

Is R.E.M. America's, best
band? A year ago, I would have
said, "Well, possibly.” After see-
ing them in concert this
summer, however, my answer
to that question is an unequivo-
cal "Yes.”

The Three O'Clock, L.A.’s
premier neo—psychedelic band,
led off the evening with an
impressive set of smooth,
melodic, yet hard-edged pop
songs. Highlights o_f their per-
formance included "Knowing
When You Smile,” "]etfighter-
man" and _"Half the Way
There,” which bears more than
a passing resemblance to the
Motown classic "Midnight
Hour." The band made the
unfortunate mistake, though,
of leading off with their best
song, "Her Head's Revolving,"
and the set had nowhere to go
from there but down.

In all, however, quite an
evening. '

R.E.M. tears down the fables  

What does it take to get a hit record?’
Berry sounds sullen and somewhat .

baffled.

"It's hard to say. That's not our end
of the business. We do live shows. We
write songs. We record and provide
the record company with records.
From there on it's kind of theirbaby.
It's their job. There were some com-
mercially accessible songs on Reckon-
ing but I don't know. I have no idea.
"South Central Rain (I'm Sorry)"
could have been a bigger hit than it
was  A lot of it, I think,.is because of
the lyrical approach."

R.E.M.'s lyrics are oblique and
often inaudible, but Michael Stipe,
who both writes lyrics and sings,
lendsa great deal to the feel of an
R.E.M. song. His words and style pro-
vide not a narrative but an aesthetic
— an aurallmusical painting which
appears different from every ‘angle
and from every distance.

Such an approach, however," can
mean trouble in the marketplace.

”Sure, it's going to bother some
people," says Berry, "But what can

we do about that? He's on stage,
armed with nothing but his words. If
he can't feel good about what he's
singing, then he can't perform. Any-
way, there are a lot of people out
there who really enjoy the fact that
we're not driving some kind of mes-
sage into their heads from the top of
the billboards. It doesn't have to be
thatway. ‘
"Programmers hear so much shit
that they are asked to play that they
find one little thing that doesn't agree

with them" right away and they throw ‘

it out and ‘say, ’I don't want anything
to do with it.’ That doesn't match my
format, because he doesn't under-
stand the vocals. We don't consider
that a problem. We're not going to
change that."

There are a lot of things R.E.M..
isn't willing to change in order to sell
records. But the promotional end
can't be ignored entirely. One area of
compromise has been videos.

"We hate the idea of doing videos
— especially the time it takes. But

Variety ma

By Leslie M. Bennett

Some say that art and corporate
enterprise can go hand in hand. Con-
sidering the thriving local theatre
community in this renascent city,
Pittsburgh lends a strong argument
to such a_statement.

Without looking very far, Pitts-
burghers can now find over a dozen

-professional and academic theatre
A companies producing a variety of

plays to suit every taste and any pock-
etbook. Absolutely everything there

» is topresent — from the absurdist

dramas of Beckett to musical hits like
A Chorus Line; from the very spiritual
Ibsen to contemporary comedy; from
local playwrights’ premieres to the
tried and true Shakespeare classics —
it's all here in town.
, Equally varied are the kinds of
theatre setting to be experienced in
the city. Pittsburgh Public Theater's
versatile three-sided or four-sided
stages give a feeling of immediacy to
its audiences, as if they too are part of
the action. Stephen Foster Memorial
Theatre, on the other hand, lends tra-
ditional warmth with its classic struc-
ture. For livingroom intimacy,
there's the Famous Rider and The
New City Theatres, both offering
very limited seating. ‘
Yvonne Steele, director of public
relations for the University of Pitts-
burgh’s theatre companies, sees

many advantages to having so many ‘

productions here, both for the Pitts-
burgh theatre community and its

 

.1..p.......gr.

audience.

"A lot of what we're doing is
incredibly satisfying,” she said. ”With
the number of local companies and
theatres growing, it's giving Pitts-
burgh performers and artists more
work, and audiences more varied and
quality theatre.”

Curt Powell of Pittsburgh Public

Theater cited three reasons for the;

attractiveness of Pittsburgh to thea-
tre people.

”It's cosmopolitan; it's literary; and
it's got a good amount of corporate
support,” he said. ”I think those are
three things that theatres need to

succeed.”
The University of Pittsburgh alone
is the home of three prominent

pany, in addition to the annual Three
Rivers Shakespeare Festival, which
takes over each summer season.
The Mainstage A Theatre is the
major academic vehicle for graduate
and undergraduate acting students in
Pitt's theatre arts department. Its
productions, which are held at the

versary. Prior to 1960, the company
existed as the Pitt Players Organiza-

head of the university's M.F.A. acting
program, VW. Stephen Coleman.
Coleman most recently appeared as a

lovable and laughable Toby Belch in

of Twelfth Night. Tennessee William's
classic, The Glass Menagerie, follows,

M.F.A. candidate Ann Marie Costa
will direct the play, which runs
March'13-2.9.

Student subscriptions for all three
shows can be purchased for $8, $11

Brookeblazes new trail
into self indulgence

ON YOUR OWN
by Brooke Shields
Villard Books

I do not wish to appear to be the
avatar of a rhetorical goon squad, but
I must take prolix delight in attempt-
ing to bring this book into a sort of
cultural perspective. ‘

If this book had been written as a
tongue-in-cheek exegesis of modern
American mores by an internation-

ally famous European satirist, it '
,would have made waves of a fashion.

Unfortunately, this is not the case
with Brooke Shields’ premier foray
into authordom.

This book is just another make-up,
exercise, diet. and pop-philosophy
pat-on-the-back administered by
Brooke to Brooke. It is not simply
that this book is essentiallyof a dis-

posable nature, itis that Shields’ mas-
sive egotism transforms this book
into_ the dregs of an already degraded
genre. ,

She offers in her dedication, ”I ded-
icate this book to you. It is my way of

' giving something to everyone who

hasever supported or encouraged
me." Thank you ‘very much Shields,
but at $16.95 a throw, I think I will
take a rain check on your latest
contribution.

I may be in the minority on this
point, but I refuse to support
Brooke's Machiavellian schemes to

convince all of the young women

inhabiting the techno—pop gutter that
it is all right to be a banal self-serving
solipsist. This is the best fraud to
masquerade as a gift since the Greeks
gave that wooden horse to the lads
from ‘Troy.

Brooke Shields is, if you do not par-

-take of the techno-pop gutter, an

 

untalented actress who rose to fame
portraying a seven-year-old prosti-
tute in Louis Malle’s film Pretty Baby.
She has also done some sexually
manipulative advertisements for Cal-

The Pitgteiiv-s,  Issue

- August 30, 1985

 

vin Klein jeans. She is also quite fa-
mousfor the film Endless Love, which
had the first widely publicized expose
of ”body-doubling.” The point that I
am trying to make is this: Brooke

 

Shields is an expert at giving nothing,
while appearing to give all, making a
lot of money, then feigning complete _

I found the ill-advised attempt, by E

an intro to sorority recruitment

RUSH
Margaret Ann Rose
Villard Books

If you are an attractive female’ with
a good body and clear complexion,

money and are willing to be catty and
vacant, but - are still able to flash a
saccharin smile on a moment's notice,
then Margaret Ann Rose,’ author of
Rush ‘(A Girl's Guide To Sorority Success),
has written a book that will carry you
through your college career.

If you don't fall into the above cate-
gory but dare to read on and discover
the intimacies of college sororities,
then you risk having 4 your intelli-
gence insulted, or worse yet, you may
feel like you've been let in on some
dirt that you'll wish you hadn't
known. '

Rose, a third-generation Zeta Tau
Alpha at the University of Texas and
1982 rush captain, writes about rush
largely from personal experience. As
rush captain, she met girls who were
cut by her sorority because they
lacked information concerning rush
protocol.

Rush is a detailed list of do’s and
don’ts for girls interested in joining a
sorority. Rose goes so far as to list the
types of summer jobs that are smiled
upon by sorority members. Popular

‘summertime occupations include

i .3’

L

typing for a doctorand working at"

Daddy's office. She recommends that
girls not mention blue collar work
they've done in the past if they want
to be invited to any rush parties.

If your goal is to rush, pledge and
join a sorority, Rush will be a useful
guide, explaining the rush process
from beginning to end.

‘According to Rose, the only way a
rushee can be invited to arush party
is if she gets a recommendation. To
get a recommendation, you send your
resume to your parents’ friends who
were sorority members by midspring
of your senior year in high school. In
some cities, members of a recommen-
dation board (home-town alumnae of
a particular sorority) check on a
rushee's father's occupation to decide
whether she should receive a recom-
mendation. '

If a candidate makes it past the
board, then she is able to join the rush
festivities, which, according to Rose,
include yelling, singing, clapping and
touching one another.

Rose suggests that rushees be pre-
pared to smile during rush activities.
"During rush," l?..r;>se writes,”rushees
and
iC;iCl.,, / . . ..
teeth (just .il<.e beauty contestants) to
make smiling easier." She also sug-
gests thatrushees practice smiling in
front of the mirror ‘before rush
begins. A V

If you are stuck for something to
say while participating in the rush
activities, Rose says that your best
bet is to talk about some elitist sport
in which you take part — like skiing,
scuba, tennis or polo. If all else fails,
she recommends you save the con-
versation by talking about the
actives’ "cute shoes.”

sorority members make of a rushee, .

according to Rose, is how she looks.
”You must work to make yourself as
attractive as possible. If you're not

‘attractive, you should play up-your

 

other strong qualities, background
and money. Physical attractiveness
plays a large part in the overall eva-
luation process.” If you strike out in
the appearance category, all is not
lost, according to the rush guide.
Confidence may make up what is
lacking in appearance.

Should you find yourself advanc-
ing to the next stage of rush, you may
be offered a bid by’ the sorority.
Should you accept, you'll become a
member of the pledge class.

If all goes according to Rose's
guide, your pledge period should end
with the climax of initiation. ”During
initiation, members are told all of the
sorority secrets. These are the moral,

philosophical and religious founda-

tions and beliefs of the sorority.”
There is a description in Rush of one
of the initiation rituals some sorori-
ties use. To symbolize rebirth, the
pledge dresses in black, lies in a casket
and symbolically rises to a new life as

a member of the sorority.

Life doesn't stop for the sorority
member after initiation. Her social
life is only beginning. To help prepare
for this new life, Rose has included a
list of what sorority girls do in their
spare time. They ”watch soap operas,
go to hap y hour, have pizza deli-
vered, go i o the library to see people

She also lists what sorority girls do
not do. They do not ”watch the news
— it's too boring and depressing, read
the newspaper — for the same rea-
son, go to the library to study —
unless finals are next week and do
laundry — it goes to the cleaner.”

Gettig to the heart of teen sex

SEX AND THE AMERICAN
TEEN AGER

by‘ Robert Coles and Geoffrey Stokes
A Rolling Stone Press Book

This is a very well documented and
well written book, but I would hesi-
tate to recommend that it be read by
everyone. If you are in a quandary
over your own sexuality, then I
would say, by all means read this
book. If you have a healthy, well-
‘regulated sex life, and you do not care
especially about the problems of the

sexually unfortunate, then don't
bother with this book.

Sex and the American Teenager would
be a wonderful gift for your parents if
you wish to illuminate them in a con-
cise and comprehensive way about
the shifting sexual mores that make
up the teenscape from which you
have been spawned. Often, as I am
sure you are aware, parents can be
completely blind to your sexual
needs, lack of sexual needs or sexual
orientation. You must remember
that they can be quite easily lost in
their own world of television, news-

papers and magazines, and be com-
pletely obtuse to what is really on
your mind. -

This is the ultimate dose of cold
water for modern parents. Here are
just a few of the sexual venues
explored by’ the authors: virginity,

oral sex, the.pursuit of sex, inter-I

racial sex, anal sexgbackdoor sex,

back-seat sex, motel sex, sex at your,

parents’ home when they are "absent,
intimacy, fear of intimacy, masturba-
tion, mutual masturbation, bondage,
casual sex, birth control, pregnancy,

abortion, kinky sex and homosexual-

ity _— all varieties. -

I would like to quote Robert Coles
from the last chapter of this book:
”Beyond a doubt, television and the
movies and all sorts of magazines
push a frivolous, self-centered, mani-
pulative, even at times violent or
weird sexuality upon us. Beyond a
doubt there is a sadly amoral aspect to

the so-called youth culture — drugs"

galore andgrock lyrics full of nastiness
or self-pity or ‘rude egotism and lots
of self-serving nihilism  and forget
not only tomorrow but others, their
standards, values, conditions, earned
moral authority.”

Which brings me to the main weak-
ness of this book. While the writers
don't shrink sexuality to the

mathematically reductive, they, as
well as the teenagers surveyed, never
reach deeply into the realm of love.
This book is about sex, not love or
passion; it never really raises itself
from themire of the clinician's mind.

I think about this book and I must
ultimately smile, because there is no
underlying sense of morality, tradi-
tion or law, except for the transient
20th-century mentality of the clinici-
an/subject symbiosis. Where is the
tenderness that both parties have dis-
carded? I smile because I think that
one human being must always be. dis-
covering another through love and
that this ultimately is what both par-
ties do not actually come to grips
with. Perhaps that is .a positive point,
because love may be too profound an
emotion for teenagers to really com-
prehend. Thank God that pop music
and the techno-pop gutter exist,
because they may just be the only two

places where immature and half-

formed teenl baroque vacuity can
truly flourish while masquerading as
something more than tawdry thrills.

Pittsburgh Pla

By Walter Ray Watson

Richard Rauh is darting from one
part of the Pittsburgh Playhouse to
another in search of copies of the
September schedule of films. He
warns a thin young man in faded
jeans and a rock-n-roll T-shirt that
"We're going, to have a busy
weekend." I

The man does not seem worried
about the overcast day that he will
float into, nor the schedule of films
that makes Rauh's eyebrows rise.

Richard Rauh's countenance,
behind his horn-rimmed glasses,

-brings to mind a 'ruddy—cheeked

Edward G. Robinson as well as a flus-
tered yet persevering Jack Benny.
And as director of the Pittsburgh
Playhouse Film Repertory for nearly
seven years (Nov. 1, 1985 will mark
that anniversary), he can in other
ways be depended on to bring back
the dead —-— films from the '20s, '30s,
'40s, as well as first-release movies.
It is late into the /morning, and
although Rauh can't figure what hap-
pened to the 50 or so copies that were
on the shelves in the lobby only a few
hours ago, he is kept busy and in a
constant flow of activity in making up
the schedules, distributing them
heavily in the Oakland section of the
city, and occasionally checking the
attendance of the films that are regu-
larly scheduled one per night, a dif-
ferent one every night of the week.
"In 1957,” Rauh said behind a desk
sprawling with paperwork, "they
started what was then called the
‘Summer Film Festival,’ and that only
ran June, July and August. And it was
different‘ from the present repertory.
They normally ran three films a week
rather than one a night. It wasn't

  
  

vhouse= The m

 

until November of '68 that the films
ran year-round, but there were still
three films a week.”

In July, 1978, a newly hired director
started the new one-film-per-night
format of seven different films every
week, starting with Annie Hall. "The
guy worked for five months and then
quit. He now works as a casting direc-
tor in New York,” said Rauh. Rauh
himself stepped in November 1978
and has been director of the Play-
house ever since. "One of the first
things I did was quadruple our mail-
ing lists. It was the thing to do given
the nature of the film repertory.

"We wanted to expand the number
of audience segments so that the film

Dan Mottsman/ The Pitt News

repertory would appeal to a broad
base of people. Initially, when I took
over the repertory, when films did
well, we immediately brought them
right back. I delayed that, so that the
mix, the variety of films every
month, was wider. In the beginning,
we were able to bring in 20 to 22 new
films every month,” "Rauh said,
lamenting thedifficulty he has in get-
ting first-run pictures from distribu-
tors for one—night rentals.

. Rauh notes that it wasn't until June
1979 that the film repertory’s format
"clicked." Attendance, with very few
dips, has continually gone up since
1978. Prices have risen as well, but
not quite at the rate of commercial

"I don't set it," he adds. "I'm not

thrilled with the prices, I have no cho-
ice. We make available coupons that
make it a. little cheaper to see the
films; 10 films-for $2.30 a piece.”
Rauh is not just concerned with the

price that customers pay to see films .

at the Playhouse. He also fights with

certain film companies on the cost of .

rentals.
"One guy demanded that we pay
$400 for a print, and he insisted on that

price. I've forgotten the movie, but he"

was saying that we'd pay his price or
not get the print; I told him we'd only
break even on a one-night booking,
so why should we pay that price? We
don't get breaks or discounts from
companies," Rauh said, offering that
in a given year anywhere from 20 to
30 film companies are called and con-
tracted for rentals of either routine
or hard-to-get prints.

Rauh's V personal favorites are
admittedly conventional. Casablanca,‘
Gone With The Wind, To Kill/I Mocking-
bird, North by Northwest, The Sound of
Music, My Fair Lady and Psycho, but this
is not the limit of his tastes. The
favorites he first mentioned are spe-

cial, and he confesses that he can

watch them over and over again.
"There are others," he said. "There's
Two for the Road — I love Audrey Hep-
burn. I also enjoy 1930s movies: Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers and
screwball comedies like The Women
and Bringing Up Baby. I like Dinner at
Eight. They're all really terrific."

Casablanca, A Clockwork Orange, King I

of Hearts, Harold and Maude, Monty
Python and the Holy Grail and La Cage Aux
Folles are cult favorites at the Play-
house and pull in appreciably large

Education — What music teaches is
best left to its pupils to express. In
some it instills insight, wisdom and
meaning. Others may conclude that
music in general is described by James
Gibbons Huneker’s remarks about
Berlioz — he ”says nothing in his
music, but he says it’ magnificently."

Therapy —— The symphony’s 1985
theme, ”Take the music cure,” is right

on target. Classical music is soothing, .

therapeutic, relaxing and cathartic.
”Music hath charms to soothe the
savage breastlTo soften rocks, or

, bend knotted oak,” says William Con-

greve in The Mourning Bride.

Spiritual Development — Probably
the most noble motive for attending a
concert is spiritual insight and
growth. For Aldous Huxley, ”After
silence, that which comes nearest to
expressing the Iinexpressible is
music.” For Martin Luther, it is ”the
art of the prophets, the only art that
can calm the agitations of the soul; It

 ‘By Carrie Stetler

”You just can't say, ‘Oh, I'm gonna
go out and make a movie on a few

hundred bucks. Far out!’ ” remarks

Bob Marinaccio, managing director
of Pittsburgh Filmmakers. ”If you're
going to work with 16mm film, it's
going to cost you about 10 thou, and
you either have to beg, borrow or
steal the money, or get grants. When
you're learning how to make films, no
one gives you money. You have to do
it with your own resources.”

In Pittsburgh, at least, no strug-
gling artist need rob a bank to get
filmmaking equipment, and no
would-be Fellini should feel frus-
trated because he doesn't yet know
what ”shot reverse shot" means. This
city has its very own Media Arts Cen-

, ter, ”the only one within a radius of

about 200 miles,” says Marinaccio.
For the average dorm-dwelling
freshman living in Oakland, the
radius is only about three blocks and,
although Pittsburgh Filmmakers is

‘located in a small, inauspicious grey

building on Oakland Avenue (across
from (.'aleco’s), it manages to func-
tion as a lending library, classroom
and movie theatre.

”We have several programs here,’
says Marinaccio of his Media Arts
Center. ”First, _there’s our academic
program, where we.teach filmmak-
ing, video production and photo-
graphy to « students. Another
program is our membership pro-
gram, whereby video artists, media

I

‘artists, filmmakers‘ and photo-
' graphers can join the organization

: -r

for a pretty low annual rate of $135
to $235 [per] month. What they get in
exchange is access to all our equip-
ment. If you're a photographer, you

have access to our darkroom,
enlargers and printers, all sorts of
stuff. Another program we have is
our exhibitions program — those are
the weekly films we show in our
screening room.” T

In November, Marinaccio says, the
Filmmakers are planning to renovate
the old Fulton Theatre downtown,
turning it into a venue for foreign
films, independently produced Amer-
ican films and performance arts
events that normally would not get to
theatres in Pittsburgh.

"The major focus of the organiza-
tion, though, is on our educational
program,” says Marinaccio. The

Filmmakers offer students about 15 -

different courses in filmmaking and
photography, which include every-
thing from Filmmaking I to Compu-
ter Video.

”This year,‘ we're also offering a
class on the films of Alfred Hitch-
cock,” adds Marinaccio.

The courses are taught by profes-
sional — sometimes nationally
acclaimed’ —— filmmakers and photo-
graphers. They are open to students
of CMU, Point Park and Carlow Col-
leges and Pitt's College of General
Studies for a course fee of $35, which

\

  accessibility to   filmmaking  

covers the cost of film and equipment
rentals and use of facilities such as
the editing or darkroom.

Unfortunately for students in
Pitt's College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS), though, the course costs
about $150 since these students must
pay their tuition directly to the Film-
makers. Because Pitt already has a
film studies program, CAS depart-
ment heads reason that students
need not go outside the university.
However, Pitt currently offers no
film production courses.

The only production courses to be
found are at the Filmmakers, who are
currently ‘engaging in ”strong negoti-
ations" with CAS to allow interested
students to register for film courses
that would be covered by their Pitt
tuition. .

Pittsburgh Filmmakers was born in

‘the late '60s when ambitious but

financially restricted local independ-
ent filmmakers pooled their _resour-

ces to lessen the cost of their

experimental moviemaking. Accord-

ing to Marinaccio, the Woodstock era

was a crucial period for the amateur

filmmaker in America. That genera-

tion founded and cultivated many

organizations like Pittsburgh

Filmmakers.

In addition, technical develop-
ments have played a part in the emer-
gence of amateur filmmaking. ”A lot ‘
of that happened because they deve-
loped Super 8 film,” said Marinaccio.
”Super 8 made filmmaking accessible:
it didn't cost tens of thousands of dol-
lars to make a five-minute film, you
could do it with a few hundred. You
could edit and play with Super 8 in a
Whole different way.”

_among the scheduled playwrights.

Productions are held at the Studio

Theatre in the basement of the
Cathedral and are free to Pitt '
undergrads.

The City Theatre Company is a
professional theatre company in'resi-
dence at Pitt whose productions at
the New City Theatre on Bouquet St.
are integrated with the theatre
department's training program,
allowing students to gain valuable
experience in professional theatre.

Yvonne Steele emphasized the
opportunities available to and within
the campus community in terms of
involvement with its theatre pro-
grams. For example, Pitt offers
numerous internships to students
interested in working with practically
every aspect of production beyond
performance. Students can work on
costumes, sets, props and administra-
tion as volunteers or students earn-
ing academic credits. There is also a
limited number of work-study posi-
tions available. In, addition, any stu-
dent who volunteers to usher for any
play gets to see the show for free. By
including discounts in subscription
rates for preview audiences, stu-
dents, senior citizens, and Pitt faculty
and staff, the university's companies
continue to provide incentives for
potential audiences, especially those
from the university community.

”I’d like to see more Pitt people at
our productions,” said Steele.

Still, the ‘theatre community out-
side of Pitt deserves exploration.

Pittsburgh Public Theatre, which
was one of the city's first professional
theatres, is now probably its most

prominent. After having celebrated
its 10th anniversary season last year,
the future looks, according to Curt
Powell, ”very rosy.” Not only is the
season subscription campaign at least
2,500 subscribers ahead of last year,
PPT’s national reputation is growing
as well. The 1985-86 season includes
six plays, opening with Tom Stop-
pard’s smash hit The Real Thing, which

won four Tony Awards in 1984. It’
‘ will run Sept. 24 through Oct. 27.

Following it "will be a special holiday
production of Life with Father running
Nov. 12 through Dec. 15. This play by

A Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse

was the longest running non-"musical
in Broadway history with 3,224 per-
formances. Master Harold and the Boys
by Athol Fugard will run Ian. 7
through Feb. 9. The fourth produc-
tion is to be announced, followed by
John Guare’s Gardenia, April 15-May
18, and George Kelly's The Show Off,
May 27-June 29. ' ~

The Pitt News, Orientation

PPT, located at One Allegheny
Square, also makes itself attractive to
students by offering 50 percent dis-
counted rush tickets a half hour
before showtime for any perfor-
mance. Also offered is a subscription
package to all six shows at 53-percent
savings off single ticket prices. In the
past, PPT provided a special student
series called Open Stage that incor-
porated both pre- and post-
performance activities designed to
create a more personal and educated
theatre experience for each student.

Some of the smaller theatres, in
both size and budget, manage to
maintain fairly ambitious goals and
supportive audiences. For example, '

.one of the goals of The American

Ibsen Theatre, which takes the work

of Henrik Ibsen as its inspiration and A

model, is to ”extend the awareness of
the richness of the dramatic tradition
by moving beyond the standard texts
that are continually performed." The

Little Creatures, by Talking Heads, is
a definite return to their roots lp, 77.
The feel of this record is very fresh
and quite charming. The often quirky
and complex sounds of the band are
far less threatening than on any of
their previous records. For the first
time in their eight-album career,

Talking Heads sound like they're

having an indisputably good time
making music. (Al-plus)

 

Low—Life, by the English band New
Order, is their third and most com-
mercially viable release to date. This
is a stunning, beautifully produced
album, recorded by the musicians

The Pitt News,‘  Tssue.-     

an A tol-" guide

with a fire-and-ice mathematical pre-
cision and passion which is bound to
please the most discerning of musical
ears. (A—plus with absolutely no
reservations)

 

Project: Mersh, by the Minutemen, is
a fine extended-play record with a
whole album's, worth of musical
hooks. The three-piece band plays an
airtight jazzlpoplpunk mixture
unlike anything currently occupying
the airwaves. The five cuts on Mersh
are laced with political references and
other sarcastic overtones. They are

one of very few bands that have made ,

the crossover from punk to pop with-
out losing their initial flair. (B-plus)

 

aw “

Poor Little Critter on the Road, by the
Knitters, is an attempt by members
of X, Dave Alvin of the Blasters and
Johny Ray Bartel to recreate their
favorite sounds in the country/west-
ern genre. The record is at times
amusing, at times heart warming and
often very silly. The main and per-
haps only problem with Poor Little Crit-
ter on the Road is its inconsistent tone.
One is never quite sure, although the
playing is competent, whether one. is
listening to a tribute or to a joke. (C-
plus) '

  

Loose Nut, by Black Flag, is a bold
step back for the band into the realm
of listenability. Gone are the 10-

vminute heavy-metal indulgences of

their last three records. Back is a band
that's lean and focused and, at times,
even entertaining. This is by no
means an outstanding record, but it's
a record nonetheless —- and perhaps a_
sign that Black Flag is once again a
band worth watching. (C-plus)

Sam Cooke Live at the Harlem Square
Club 1963 presents the legendary per-
former in at very different light. Here

is a man and his audience totally at .

ease with each other in the raw, unaf-
fected atmosphere of an uptown New
York City club in the early 1960s.
‘Although the sound quality is'q’ueS-

tionable, the songs and the voice are '

wonderful and unmistakable. (B)

Cupid £1 Psyche 85, by Scritti Politti,‘ A
is already an extremely successful 

popldance record in the U.K. At its
best, it offers something a little
beyond the typical dance—floor throb

of the techno-pop genre. At its worst, A A

Cupid 8 Psyche 85 is a self-serving bar-
rage of studio indulgence. We'll call it
a stand-off. (A plus F equals C)

Fables of the Reconstruction, by
Georgia-based R.E.M., is another
glowing step in the band's quest to
bring mystery, imagination and

integrity ‘back into the mainstream of _ A L’

American popular music. This album
works best when taken in its entirety,

" but it is also chock-full of wonderful -
songs that could easily cross over into .

AOR»hits, most notably ”Can’t Get

There From Here." (A—plus with .a_

bullet)

lnternationalists, by: the Style Coun-
cil, is for Paul Weller yet. another

. large step away from the punklR&B

of the Jam and toward an even jazz-
ier, less rock—oriented sound. There is
still the headstrong attitude and the

socialist overtones, but the passion”

The Dream ofthe Blue Turtles, by Sting.
Barring any Police albums until the
late fall, this is the next best thing.
Sting, the lead singer"/songwriter for

the Police, shows with this jazzy, '

mellow and often soulful record that
even at'his most pompous he can still
be invigorating. (B)

Around the World in a Day, by Prince
and the Revolution, is nine amazingly
diverse songs, each one an experi-
ment with some succeeding and some
not. It stands, thus, as a noble
attempt at eschewing pop accessibil-
ity in favor of greater artistic free-
dom. A warning to Prince fans:
Although there isn't a really bad song
in the bunch, none have the
-lightening-bolt-up-the-spine effect
of his previous work. (A)

Lysyrgic Emanations, by The Fuzz-
tones, fakes a bad attitude better than
it epitomizes one. The group seems to
be nothing more than weasels in gim-
mickry to steal money from naive
teeny-boppers from the 'burbs. Pass
by this album unless you are into col-
lecting the kitsch of the '80s. (D)

Red 7, by the almost-Genesis clone
Red 7, is a cold, poorly conceived
album. It isn't that this lp is painstak-
ingly incompetent, it's just that it has

terly miss the '70s. The band did score _

a minor coup, however, when its
song ”Heartbeat” was used recently
as soundtrack music for NBC’s
”Miami Vice." (D—plus)

/irrive*Without Travel, by The Three
O'Clock, is a very listenable pop
album. Unfortunately, this L.A.
quartet is not very original. Incredi-
bly fey vocals, not—too-intelligent lyr-
ics and lack of focus could mean this
band may do a lot of traveling and
never arrive. (C-plus)

Staying Out Late With Beat Rodeo, by
Beat Rodeo, is a fairly lame offering
by a derivative quartet of New York-
based musicians. This album seems to
have pretentions toward the s0pQ-
rific rehash of indigenous American
music. Empty riffing abounds, lack of
imagination astounds, and the beat
goes on. Pass up the Beat Rodeo as
you travel down the endless highway
of life. (D) p L

Be Yourself Tonight, by the Euryth-
mics, is -perfect — technically. The
music on this record is as steely cold
as Annie Lennox's face on the front
of the sleeve. Everything that was
fascinating and mysterious about
earlier Eurythmics material is gone,
and so is everything that was unique.

Tao, by Rick Springfield, may be his
initial voyage into the complex world
of Oriental thought — fortunately,
he emerges with his brain unscathed.
The sentiments expressed tend to be
nicely produced, but the songs tend
toward the mediocre. It is for con-
firmed Springfield fans only. (C)

Pittsburgh Playhouse: The man behind the movies

continued from page 11
crowds annually. Gone With The Wind,
although it's only shown once a year,
does big business as well.

For the last two or three summers,
Rauh has had use of the larger of the
Playhouse's three theaters, the Rock-
well Theater, which permits him the
luxury of special dates f-rom June
through September for foreign films
like the 15 hour Rainer Maria Fass-
binder Berlin Alexanderplatz, shown
over the course of four consecutive

_nights, as well as the more recent
‘ Alfred Hitchcock film festival, which

featured 39 of the "master of sus-
pense’s" important, admired and fas-
cinating movies.

Rauh admits that he got the idea
for the "Hitch” fest from reading
about a similar month—long event
that featured 41 films at New York's
renowned repertory art house, the
Regency, a place he notes to be New
York's ”biggest and best" theater of
its kind. 

”It was quite a hassle to get it to
work. I found out that other places —
San Francisco and Boston — had done
similar festivals, and when I saw that
it had never been done in Pittsburgh,
I got excited about the idea." Rauh
said that aside from several calls to
secure Suspicion for the festival (a
problem rooted in the film company's
unwillingness to give him the OK as

far as six months in advance), nearly

everything fell into place.

"I told them, 'Give me the picture
for one night.’ I thought it was an
important one for the festival — Cary
Grant and Joan Fontaine were in it.
But even Hitchcock wasn't crazy
about it," Rauh said of Suspicion. Some
Hitchcock films did booming business

during July. "We almost set a house
record on July 6 with Rear Window. It
was just jammed that night. Vertigo
did very well, To Catch a Thief  Rape
and The Birds didn't do well," Rauh
said, noting that the two were consid-
ered very popular but were not well-
attended this time around.

Rauh was able to bring such films
as A Love In Germany and The Times of
Harvey Milk to the Playhouse this
summer, something that few com-
mercial theaters were capable of or
willing to risk scheduling. There-are
films for reasons other than financial
that Rauh will never book again; the
most recent such picture that comes

. to Rauh’s mind is the Led Zeppelin
concert film, The Song Remains The
Same.

"The only movie that really.
annoyed me was The Song Remains The .

Same," Rauh said, explaining that the
crowd the film attracted was not
well-behaved. ”It was a very difficult
evening. People were stealing things
from the Playhouse, people were
beating people up  It appeared in
Boston and a riot occurred in the
theater. We had one disturbance the
night we showed Ghostbusters, but this
movie stretched the patience of
myself and the staff to the very limit.
There were 950 people who came out
for the shows, some from as far away
as Cleveland. People pleaded with us,
offering $15, $20 and even $25 for us
to add a third show. But we told them
no, we had two shows on the sche-
dules and our staff had other things
to do. We made a lot of money, but
that was a toughevening."

A new attendance record was reg-
istered in the Rockwell Theater this
summer with the three scheduled

screenings of the Talking Heads con-
cert film, Stop Making Sense. ”It was the
biggest hit, I'm serious, in terms of
attendance. It beat the record holder
Monty Python and the Holy Grail by about
200 people. I was very pleased but
surprised,” Rauh commented. "I was
in New York at the time it was being

shown. I'll have to show it again so I ,

can see it."

The importantnote to make about
Rauh’s work, if there is a secret to
taking suggestions and comparing

' old schedules _of monthly bookings V

for a truly mixed bag of films for
general consumption, is in the timing
of booking certain films, as Rauh will
readily tell anyone within earshot.
"Sometimes it's timing, and you think
a film will do well, but it won't. I don't
know. Spinal Tap, a spoof on rock con-
cert movies, did well, and so did Berlin
Alexanderplatz. There were 400 people
who bought full-price tickets. You're

paying for 15 and a half hours of .

movie. There were 30 people who
bought single-night tickets for $5 a
piece. It was very successful. I sat,
stood mostly, through the whole four
nights. It showcased Hanna Schuy-
gulla. People came up to me and said,
’bring some more Fassbinder films.’ I
told them I'm all Germanned-out.
And I'm German! I said, ‘Wait. I have to
get Fassbinder out of my system.’
Lots of people loved it, told me it was
terrific. One woman came as far as
Erie to see it."

When asked if he ever gets tired,
Rauh replied that he's been doing it so
long that he may just be stuck with it.
He has plans to get his side career of
acting together. In a few weeks, he is
tentatively scheduled to try out for a
part in Dave Mamet's The Frog Prince, a

play for children, which will be pro-
duced by the New City Theater Com-

' pany in town. "Yes," Rauh confides,

"I get burned out. I have, as of the

month of August 1985, booked 2,621 1

pictures, and so I've made at least as
many phone calls to get them."
October is favorites month, in

which all the movie requests that‘. » A

some first-run films that Rauh isable

repertory under Richard Rauh’s-

direction. "There are no plans for a

Shelley Winters festival," Rauh says '

with a wry ~smile, letting on that
someone had actually suggested such
an event. "It’s not appropriate.”

”The thing that keeps me going is
thechallenge to create a mixed sche-
dule of movies, and occasionally I get
tired. At times it gets real tough,"
Richard Rauh says, showing his most
adamant Jack Benny face, pausing
just for a moment. ”Do you want a
job?" just kidding.

Syria Mosque
August 15, 1985

The first thing that strikes you
about a Kenny Loggins concert is the

energy he brings to the stage. His

extroverted, hold—nothing-back style
and his choreographic gyrations
grew more intense and frenzied as
the evening progressed. All of this in

spite of an overheated Syria Mosque.

that had the audience fanning them-
selves with their programs.

Loggins demonstrated his musical
versatility from the moment he
entered the stage in his peach-colored
suit. It wasn't long before the heat
got to him as he tossed off his jacket
and played the rest of the night in a
tank top.

His musical repertoire includes
‘folk, rock ’n’ roll, R & B and funky
jazz numbers that dazzle with their
versatility. No wonder that ever since
his musical career began in partner-
ship with Jim Messina in 1970, Log-
gins has earned one gold and three
platinum albums, and 21 chart
singles.

He has received two Grammy
awards (”What A Fool Believes,” song
of the year in 1980, and ’’This Is It,”
best pop vocal song in 1981), and an
Academy Award nomination. He was
also included in Billboard Magazine's list
of the Top 10 Male Pop Singles
Artists of 1984, making his mark
with his No. 1 hit ”Footloose,” one of
the biggest-selling singles of the year.

Backed by an able group of musi-

cians, Loggins launched his show
with material from his early days and
adroitly wove the audience through
an emotional maze of joyous sensual-
ity, melancholic tenderness and near
tear-like nostalgia. The core of the
first part of the show was a medley of
”Whenever I Call You Friend," "What
A Fool Believes” and ”Heart To
Heart." The bubbly harmony and
sweet, dulcet tones set the crowd up
for what followed.

The first half of the two hour, non-
stop concert was demarcated by the
exit of the band from the ‘stage, save
Loggins, who sat down on the lip of
the stage, strummed his guitar and
played solo numbers. Most of these
songs were from his Loggins and
Messina days, which transformed the
spacious Syria Mosque into an inti-
mate coffeehouse. Loggins had the
audience begging for ”Danny's
Song," but held them off until they
reached a near-fever pitch. With the

return of the band on stage, the ’

second half of the concert began, and
it was all crescendo from there on
out. . - «
Guy Thomas, guitarist, impressed
the crowd with his acoustical eroti-
cism. Tris lmboden dazzled with his
prowess on Simmons electric drums
that -sometimes overpowered the
band. Bassist Nathan East was often
overshadowed by the rest of the band
but performed capably, if somewhat
dispiritedly. Nevertheless, his mes-
merizing voice contributed to the
back—up vocals. Steve Wood and Neil

B KENNY LOGGINS

enny Loggins

Larsen provided accomplished key-

. board arrangements.

Kicking the show into high gear,
Loggins ran through a series of up-
tempo hits, highlighted by the driv-
ing, synthesizer-laden ”No Looking
Back.”

Each of the band members was
given a_ solo spot in the second half of
the concert. Loggins used interesting
techniques like guitar dueling with
Thomas, having the musicians echo
his vocal patterns, and engaging in
humerous monologue with the band
members and audience to keep the

interest level high.

Loggins shouted that he wanted
everyone to have one ”rush” before
the end of therconcert. The biggest
audience response followed when he
broke into ”Forever," a song that gal-
vanized the crowd. By the time the
final number -——— "Celebrate Me
Home” — arrived, the audience" of
2,700 fans was on its feet, singing and
swaying to the music, having been
put through an emotional mill by one
of our most polished and professional
contemporary musicians.

continued from page 5
when we did the video for 'Can't Get
There From Here,’ unlike in the past
when we really went into it with a
sour attitude, we thought, ’Well look,

if we have to do it, let's at least have.

fun and enjoy it,’ instead ofjust going
through the motions. It was also cool
’cause I got to use my own car and
Mike_got to use his car."

But do videos rob the public of their
imagination? Do they give a totalitar-
ian image of a song?

”That's always been a problem,
artistically, that we have to deal with
when we do videos. Not to mention
that most of them are sexist, racist,
violent or just stupid and insult your
intelligence. How do you combat all
those things and make a video that's
worth watching? The art form I'm
not opposed to. It's a good medium.
But it's just so improperly done that
the word ’vide_o' kind of sends a shiver
up my back.” /

Although they've

surrendered

somewhat on the video point, R.E.M.,
according to Berry, has a great deal of
artistic control for a band without
any platinum behind it.

"Yeah, we enjoy a good rapport

sign-of

with the record company and we
demanded that [control] in our con-
tract. They were kind of miffed about
that, like, ’Who do these kids think
they are, calling the shots? What do
they know?’ Well, we did, and now
they're glad we take initiative. A lot
of people they deal with they have to
lead around like babies. Anyway, our
instincts about what we're doing are
usually the most accurate."

R.E.M.'s instincts are impeccable
on Fables. It's even denser than their
last two records and easily as accessi-
ble. It's a step forward both artisti-
cally and commerically. But is there a
limit to the salability of songs whose

choruses can't be easily replaced wit '

"Drink Diet Coke”? -
A lot could rest with the co_mmer-
cial success of Fables. Not many bands
have made it into the mainstream
from an independent label. Even
fewer have made it the hard way —
producing strong records. R.E.M., so
far, has accomplished this, and a
breakthrough for them now could
change the way radio stations (and
thus the public) look at independent
labels and their bands, which any
critic would readily admit are among

  The “Pitt News,"orientatiori‘#issué§§  j 4 

the best this country has to offer.
Berry is adamant on this point.

”I hate to say that the future of
American rock—n—roll lies with the
success of this record by R.E.M., but
yes, I think that's very true. You
know, it's funny, when we were in
New York two weeks ago and our
guy, whose job it is to get us played on
the radio, had talked to people who
didn't want to play it because they
didn't hear that hit that sounded like

 

a Steve Lillywhite production. But
they had to play it because it's appear-
ing on playlists at virtually every
[AOR] station in the U.S.”

Perhaps America's pop-crazed pub-
lic is ready for R.E.M.’s intelligent,
oblique style of rock—n—roll. But as
one fan attending their recent

appearance at Oakland's Syria,

Mosque put it: "Americans like their
music to hit them over the head,
R.E.M. won't do that."

Prid vs the retur

So we're midway through the
'80s and what have we done?
Our romantic preoccupation
with the styles and ideals of the
latter portion of the 19505 and
early 1960s has grown into a
formidable passion. We now pay
dearly to dress as our parents
did, and boast hairstyles and
garments most befitting Frank-
ie Avalon and Annette Funicello
(to hell with Sonny and Cher).
We exhibit a conscious sense of '
appropriateness that would
have been scorned by our peers
of 15 years ago.

Coupled with this rehashed-
fashion is a new generation of
musicians who seek not only to
imitate but to emulate their
heroes of decades past, first
with a rockabilly hop, then with
tightly-controlled, AM-
accessible tunes and, most
recently, with chiming guitars,
Wayfarer sunglasses and the
official mark of paisley.

Thanks to bands such as the

,now—defunct Stray Cats, Huey
Lewis and the News and L.A.'s
‘ latest sensation, The Three
O’Clock, the musical styling
that once characterized the na-
ivete of a past generation has
again been brought to the fore.
The reason? Flashing back to
simpler days provides us with a
much needed release from the
tension of the constricting '80s.

Both socially and musically,
such a movement is in part only

The Pitt News, orientation iiss5iu‘e  iiuigosi‘3o,iii1 583 I

salon-deep. But to a growing
number of us, it appears equally
reactionary — a reversion to a
period when the preferred view
of life was the one seen through
rose-tinted lenses; moreover, a
time when many of us were still
in diapers. But as cosmetic as it
may appear to some, such a leap
backwards has its serious
implications. .
The late '50s and early '60s
presented to its youth a drasti-
cally different set of circum-
stances than those we face.
Years ago, the American econ-

omy was stuffed with oppor- '

tunity and inflation had yet to
gouge holes in the pockets of its
generation. Young people could
afford time to meander about

I1  t

  

the social and academic scene.
Surviving the '80s, however,
by the way of premises and
ideals that were established
decades ago is about as realistic
as the full-time artist's conten-
tion that he will survive by
sheer love of his work. Having
nothing in 1985 is to have even
less than the nothing of 20 years
ago. The ”shrinking pie” syn-
drome has stomped on the rose-

colored lenses and we are faced

with a more lucid picture of our
world, \a sight that ' has some,
instead of dropping out to find
themselves, dropping into law
schools‘ and‘ M.B.A. programs
(the plan is to grab for the ”pie”
before the bakery stops produc-

_ A tion). Others simply retreat into



y womb

nostalgia. .
The current .paisley boom
seems a conscious way of recap-
turing the feel of times, that in
retrospect, appear magical. We
must be wary of this illusion.
The intoxicating privileges of
affluence are often mis-
construed as magical, as is a trip

to the Orient or a whirlwind"

weekend in New York City (if,
of course, you are able to afford
such magic). Let's not confuse
these ideas.

"Historically, hard times have
served to push the strong to
heights they never dreamed
existed, forced the weak to
adapt or perish and kept thevast
majority in check with limited
financial resources. We may

only hope that this time around, - A

the psychological effects of
looking backwards will indeed
create some sort of informed
game plan for the children of

_the 19905, as opposed to trick-

ling away as yet another futile
attempt by young people to‘
return to the comfort of the
womb. We have too much pride;
to let that happen. Don't we?

The Pitt News, Orientation Issue - August 30, 1985

Returning to form, from 3-7-1 to 10-1

By Jim Urban
-Sports Editor 4

Following a 3-7-1 season, not
many people would expect a team to
make a complete turn around and go
10-1. Well, expect it. Although the
Pitt Panthers face the task of
defending against three of the better

' runners in college football (Ohio

State’s Keith Byars, Penn State’s
D.J. Dozier and Navy's Napolean
McCallum), as well as three good
quarterbacks (Purdue's Jim Everett,
South Carolina's Mike Hold and
Rutgers’ Rusty Hochberg), they will
rebound.

Unlike last year, when it seemed

that opponents were catching Pitt at
just the right time, the situation will
be reversed this year. Pitt will catch
three of its opponents —— Boston
College, West Virginia and North
Carolina State — the week after they
each face Maryland, a team that will
be very powerful and was ranked
No. l by Sport magazine. That
should help.

In addition, Pitt hosts South
Carolina the week after its annual
battle with the Georgia Bulldogs,
another emotional and physical con-
test that will work in Pitt’s favor.

Ohio State, perhaps the most tal-
ented team on the schedule, will be
playing its season opener against
Pitt, while the Panthers will already

have one game and five weeks of.

practice under their belts. It is no
longer an “against all odds” sto_ry.
Here is a closer look at the upcoming
season:

Purdue. August 31 . 1985.
at Pitt Stadium

The Boilermakers open their sea-
son here at Pitt hoping to repeat

, their opening-game performance of
a year ago when they upset the

quarterbacks in the country in
senior Jim Everett. Everett finished
fifth in the nation in total offense last
year as he passed for over 3,000
yards, the first Boilermaker quarter-
back to do so. *

Tailback Rodney Carter and
flankers Rick Brunner (30 catches)
and Steve Griffin (64 catches) are
expected to compliment Everett the

most. “The strength of our offense is

in our quarterback, Jim Everett, and
the specialist positions, with our
recievers and running backs,” said
Burtnett. While Purdue has a young,
virtually unproven offensive line,
Burtnett is hoping his skilled special-
ists will carry the load.

On defense, Purdue seems to be
solid. The front five are experienced
and proven, but Burtnett remains
cautious. “The secondary and inside
linebackers are our question mark,”
said Burtnett. “On paper, our
defense is stronger than in quite
some time now, it's just a matter of
how they will play.”

Purdue will look to throw, utiliz-
ing Everett, its most talented player.
The Boilermakers remember their
victory over Notre Dame in the
opener last year, and will think
about the same happening here on
Aug. 31. '

Pitt will come out fired up to dom-
inate the line of scrimmage as the
Panthers roll over the Boilermakers.

Prediction: Pitt 31-Purdue

Ohio State. September
14. 1985, at Columbus,
OH

One national publication says the
Buckeyes have the best player in the
nation at three different positions.
Tailback Keith Byars already is the
odds on favorite to win the Heisman
Trophy. He’s one of the three. The
other two are wide reciever Cris Car-
ter and linebacker Thomas Johnson.

Can this team be beaten?

“We are a tailback-oriented team
with Keith Byars," said Ohio State
head coach Earle Bruce. “He’s the
finest football
coached.” Foge Fazio hopes Byars
doesn’t turn out to be the finest foot-
ball player he’s ever coached against.
The Panthers might be in trouble if
he does. The Panthers will key on
Byars in much the same way they

day, and you can bet Fazio’s game
plan will include pressure on the
quarterback. Ohio State returns

- only one starter from the offensive
' line, and it will be a baptism of fire

for the four new starters.

Ohio State’s defense will take on a
new look this year. Bruce eliminated
the nose guard and will employ three
linebackers instead. He is confident
of his 4-3 defense. “The strength of
our defense is our linebackers and
our improved secondary,” said

Bruce. “We have some big-play men
on defense, and this is what it takes

— to win."

Should this game turn into a bat-
tle for field position, Pitt may be in
trouble. Ohio State has two of the

best kickers in the nation in punter .

Torn Tupa (averaging 47.1 yards)
and placekicker Rich Spangler.
Pitt should once again dominate

the line of scrimmage;.the one game ‘

under its belt will prove to be the
difference. Byars is held in check,
and thus, Ohio State is held in check,
as the Panthers squeak by for their
second victory.

The goodnews is that Doug Flutie

three. Coach Jack Bicknell indicated

that,~had Flutie been a high school '

senior last year, he" probably would
not have been offered a scholarship
because of the other talented quar-
terbacks Bicknell signed.

For now, though, Shawn Hallo-
ran, Flutie’s backup last year, is
being given the best shot to win the
job.» Halloran, a 6-4 senior, has
attempted only 42 passes in his colle-
giate career.

Tailback Troy Stradford is back,

, and Bicknell calls him “the best run-

ning back I have ever coached.” On
the outside, Gerard Phelan is gone,
but returning is Kelvin Martin (37
catches) and Darren Flutie (Doug’s
Brother). The offensive line remains
intact.

Defensively, Bicknell lost six reg- '

ulars to graduation, so it might turn
out to be a rough year. Three of the
six departed players were in the
secgndary, so BC’s first priority is

match three new players with return-
ing cornerback Neil lton.

Elsewhere —— defensively — BC is
in pretty good shape. All-America
candidate Mike Ruth returns at nose
guard to anchor the line, while
sophomore Bill Romanowski, last
year’s Cotton Bowl MVP, will head
a crew of young but very talented
linebackers. --

When BC comes to Pitt, it will be
following a three-game ‘span in
which BC plays Brigham Young,
Temple and Maryland. The inexpe-

‘ rienced secondary may be very well

seasoned by that time, since BYU,
Temple and Maryland all have quar-
terbacks who can throw the football.

Pitt should again dominate the

line ofscrimmage and roll to its third ‘

victory.

Prediction: Pitt 31-Boston,

College 7

West Virginia, September
28, 1985, at Morgantown,
West Virginia

Every time these two teams get
together, it gets pretty intense. “Pitt”
is the kind of four letter word you
just do not use down there in West
Virginia. The Mountaineers have
beaten Pitt for two straight years,
and if you ask them, they will be glad
to tell you about it.

When Foge Fazio shook up his
staff last year, one addition he made
was new quarterback coach Russ
Jacques. Jacques was brought up
from West Virginia, where he was
offensive coordinator from 1980 to
1984. Jacques knows the mountain-
eers as well as anyone, and he warns,
“They are going to be very good.”
good.”

And how! WVU returns almost
everyone from last year’s nationally
ranked defense. “It’s true we have
some fine players on that side of the
ball,” said head coach Don Nehlen,

The Pitt News,‘ Orientation Issue - August_30, 1985

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

During last season's dismal 3-7-1
record, much of the criticism was
directed at the failure of the Panther
offense to move the football. As a
result, Joe Moore stepped down and
head coach Foge Fazio hired Chuck
Stobart in his place.

Stobart comes to the Panther staff
with impressive credentials. As the
offensive coordinator of the Michi-
gan Wolverines in the early '70s, he
was credited with their powerful
attack. From there, he went on to
head coaching jobs, first at Toledo
University (1976-1980) and then at
the University of Utah (1981-1984).
His offense at Utah in 1983 gained
430 total yards a game, which was
the eighth highest total in the
country.

Coach Stobart talked about what
his offensive philosophy is and how
he plans to use it at Pitt. ,

— Do you bring a.certain offen-
sive philosophy into the coaching
situation or does the situation dic-
tate your philosophy?

“If your philosophy can fit into
the personnel that you have and if
there is any way that you can blend
the philosophy you have with pre-
vious philosophy, then I think it
makes it a lot easier with the players.
That's one of the things we have
tried to do, although I have a funny
feeling that our philosophy is a little
bit different than what Pitt's philo-
sophy has been over the last three or
four years.”

—-— What will the difference be
from the offensive philosophy that
Pitt has used over the past three or
four years? '

“We're really balanced, we're‘
striving hard to be balanced and
that's balance in running left-right,
balance running inside-outside, and
balance in run and pass. That
changes everything over from being
a 60-70 percent passing‘ team to a 30
percent running team or vice versa. I
think when Pitt had Dorsett, they
were probably 70-30 run to pass;
with Marino, it was probably 70-30
pa-ss to -run. We are going to be
somewhere in between both of
those.”

—— When you came here and saw
all the talent at running back, did it
make you think that you would run
the ball a little more than pass?

“To me, one of the reasons you
must run the ball at Pitt is that I look
at those big strong offensive linemen
and traditionally Pitt has had big
linemen, then I look at the five run-
ning backs we have, plus some of the
freshman kids coming in, and those
are all highly talented football play-
ers. I think we have to be able to use
those abilities that they have. Our
outside people like Scales, Milloy,
Hairston and Stewart are all capa-
ble, and we have four freshmen com-
ing in so Ijust want to be able to use

all those skilled football players.‘

Clint Wilson, our tight end, has a lot

of skill, so we're going to really try to i

use all of them, not just one or two,
but all. When we line up we want the
defense to worry about all of those
players.” .

—- Is getting all of the players
involved in the offense something
you must do in order to keep all of
the highly recruited players happy?

“No, but I think it's something
you must do to keep the defense
from overloading on you. I think if
you can do that, then you don’t
worry about all those overloading
defenses and different things that
they'll give you on defense. I think
that helps make your offense a little
bit easier for your players to execute.
If you can do that, you don’t get all
those different blitzes, different
twists, fire games, corner stunts. If
you get where you're weak, then you
just tell the defense, ‘Stop this over
here,’ then all of a sudden you're
going to‘be in a ball game where you
don't have anything else to go to and
I don't want to do that. We've been
able to do that. We've been able to
do that. We've been able to keep our
offense balanced to keep the defense
pretty balanced."

— Have you seen films of last
year's offense? If so, what do you
think the problems were?

‘‘I think one of the big problems
after watching films was that any
time a team loses its "quarterback,
then you have a problem. He is the
one guy that has to ‘be the stable,
consistent thing. He’s the guy that
gets them out of the huddle, gets
them up, gets them off the ball, and

A 3 Chuck Stobart

he is also the guy that the offense is
basically geared to. You can't do
anything that your quarterback
can't do ability-wise. Very few col-
leges have two quarterbacks with the
same kind of ability, which means
that when one gets hurt, if you're not
careful, you change too much and it
hurts all 10 other players. In the film
I saw, there were three or four differ-
ent quarterbacks in there, and that
has to hurt your offense.”

— Will you be calling all of the
offensive plays yourself?

“Hopefully our whole offensive
staff willbe a big factor in calling the
plays. We'll take a lot of pains dur-
ing the ‘course of the week to set
down our game plan, have the plays
that we want to run in all the situa-
tions, then our coaches are assigned
to different responsibilities on game
day. Any time the defense changes
what we anticipated, then it's the
coaches’ responsibility to get that

' information to us. So as far as cal-

ling each play and sending it in, yes,
I'll do that, but all that information
has to come from the other
coaches.”

— Who is the starting quarter-

_ back right now? ' .

“Right now it's John Congemi.
He’s our starter and he's got to have

5 a great year for us. Joe Felitsky had

a great spring, so I think he will be
ready. It's going to be interesting to
see how he comes along. We've got
Joe for three years, so there's no
question he's important, but John
Congemi is our quarterback. He is
very knowledgeable, he knows our
football, he knows defense and we
can do a lot with him in there.”

— Do you feel any pressure
because of what happened last year?

“I'm sure _there's pressure here,
but I've felt pressure every year that
I've been a coach. So it's another
football season, it's another pressure
situation. College football today is a
lot of pressure. There's been a saying

' going around for many, many years

that if you can't stand the heat in the
kitchen you‘ better get out. That
heat's going to be there and we just
have to take it, keep our ﬁngers
crossed and hope our players can
produce on Saturday afternoon for
us. If they do, we'll take that pres-
sure off."

Sports Editor

Many people wish to forget last
year’s 3-7-1 Pitt football season.
Those who do remember it,
remember it as a black spot on what
had been a decade of unparalleled
accomplishments for Pitt football.
But there is another view of the lost
season of 1984.

The 3-7-l season of the past year
was the result of inexperience and
injuries. But if there is one positive
thing about injuries, it is the fact that
someone else always gets to step in
and play. That is the case here. As a
result, Coach Foge Fazio has what
one national publication described
as “the best two-deep talent in the
East.”

Here’s a closer look:

OFFENSE

Quarterback — No question here.
“Johnny Congemi is my quarter-
back,” said Fazio.

Yes indeed. Congemi showed just
how much his army affects Pitt’s for-
tunes when he returned to health last
year and helped Pitt to late-season
wins over Tulane and archrival Penn
State. Congemi played only three
full games due to a stress fracture in
his ankle, but those were the three
games Pitt won last year. As Con-
gemi goes, so go the Panthers. When
he’s on, it doesn’t get much better.

The 6-0 senior from Lauderdale
Lakes, Fla., has already passed for
over 3,000 yards in his career at Pitt
and should soon slip by Matt Cava-
naugh on Pitt’s all-time career pass-
ing list.

Unlike last year, however, this is
no longer a shallow position for
Fazio. Fresh off the ineligible list is
Central Catholic High School prod-
uct Joe Felitsky. Felitsky, a 6-3
sophomore, is finally able to play
following a year of redshirting after
transferring from Notre Dame. No
slouch himself, Felitsky possesses a

‘ cannon arm, probably the best on

the team. Should Congemi go down,
Felitsky will be ready to play.

John Cummings is not out of the
picture. Cummings went through a
tough season last year — the type of
season that might make another
player give up. Cummings didn’t.

He began as Congemi’s backup
but soon found himself out of the
quarterback picture after the Pan-
thers’ 13-12 loss at Temple. Cum-
mings has rebounded and will
challenge Felitsky for the second
spot. “This is the best that John
Cummings has looked since the 1983
fall camp,” said Fazio. Cummings
will contribute whenever he has the
opportunity.

Out of the picture is Chris Jelic, a
part-time starter last year when
Congemi went down the second
time, and Dante Wiley, the self-
proclaimed starter going into camp
last year who is now academically
ineligible. Jelic gave up football to
pursue a baseball career, while
Wiley seems to have played more
different positions than Pete Rose
will ever dream of.

Projected Starter: John Congemi-
l5. Grade: A.

Backﬁeld — In Fazio’s preseason
description of the team, he said,
“Our goal is to get our offense more
consistent. Our strength lies in the
guys who will be running the
football.”

No argument here,,Charles Glad-
man, a 5-1 1, 205-lb. tailback, has the
potential to follow in a line of great

Pitt running backs. Last year, while‘

splitting time with Craig Heyward,
Gladman managed to gain 525
yards.

He is backed up at tailback by
Brian Davis, last year’s Parade Mag-
azine co-Player of the Year _at
Washington High. Davis is who
some people_ are calling “the next
Tony Dorsett," but he has been
hampered by hamstring problems

Fazio enjoys talent and depth throughout the lineup

during camp and was ruled out of .

the Purdue game on August 20.
Regardless, tailback is the position
that is chock-full of ability at Pitt.
Backfield coach Andy Urbanic
called his troops “the most talented
group of players I’ve had since I've
been at Pitt."

Two more players will challenge
for playing time at tailback. Sopho-
more Zeke Gadson and redshirt
freshman A.B. Brown both came on
last spring and are ready to fit in
somewhere.

_At ‘ fullback, junior Tommy
Brown will draw the startafter an
injury to senior Darnell Stone put
him out until at least the Ohio State
game. Brown (6-1 225) is a strong
blocker with good pass—catching
abilities. Gadson will also see some
time at fullback until Stone returns.

Providing depth at fullback is jun-
ior Jeff Frelick. Redshirt freshman
Vernon Kirk was expected to help
out at fullback, but like Wiley, fell
short academically.

Last year, the fullback position
did not play a major role in me Pitt
offense, but look for more this year.
Projected Starters: Charles
Gladman-32 and Tom Brown-44.
Grade: A-plus. .

Offensive Line — Imagine this
offensive line in front of your quar-
terback: Bill Fralic and Jimbo
Covert as the tackles, Mark May
and Russ Grimm as the guards and
Jim Sweeney as center. This is a
potential All-Pro offensive line. All
are Pitt products and graduates of
the Joe Moore School for Offensive
Linemen. .

Last year’s Valedictorian at the
Moore School was Fralic; this year,
it seems to be 6-4, 280-lb. Randy
Dixon. Dixon, who is only a junior,

’ played opposite Fralic last year at

the other tackle spot but was over-
shadowed by Fralic. This year, he is
not far behind Fralic in ability
though. Said Fazio, “He has the size,

 

' /.-

shoulders of Tom Brown.

The weight of the fullback position  on the

 

strength and speed to fall in line with
the Mark Mays, Russ Grimms,
J imbo Coverts and the Bill Fralics.”
This is by no means a one-man
show, however.

“We have about six guys who
started a lot of games for us last
year," noted Fazio. Joining Dixon
at the other tackle spot will be 6-5,
265-lb. senior Tony Brown. Brown
has been playing regularly for the
past two seasons, and although he is
not as devastating as Fralic was, he

is a very competent replacement for
the guy that wound up the second
player selected in the NFL draft. _

In the middle of the offensive line,
it’s like musical chairs. Senior Mike
Dorundo (6-3, 260) has right guard
sewn up, but Barry Pettyjohn (6-5,
255) and Bobby Sign (6-3, 265) will
alternate between left guard and
center. Sophomore Ed Miller, who
has had problems with a knee injury
suffered over the summer, if healthy,

Lady Panthers ready to
shoot for Top-20

By Michael Bertonaschl
Staff Writer

This fall will mark the 12th year
that the University of Pittsburgh has
competed in women's volleyball on
the Division I level. It will also mark
the first time during those 12 seasons
that the women’s volleyball team
will rank as one of the Top 20 teams
in the country in the preseason polls.

Sixth-year head coach Shelton

Collier received the news last week
that at least one publication,
Women's Sports Magazine, will list
the Lady Panthers among the
Nation's elite. Collier believes that
the prestigious Volleyball Monthly
Magazine will also rank his team in
the Top 20. Official word from both
magazines will not be released until
sometime in September.

All of the national attention
comes as no surprise to Collier and
his players. During spring practice
they gathered to discuss their goals
for the 1985 season. They decided to
work to repeat their Big East cham-

The first obstacle the spikers must

while starting for the East team at
the National Sports Festival and will
be sidelined for four weeks. Both
Lisa Stewart (sprained ankle) and
Dianne Zerbey (knee injury) should

the season.

Collier gave each player instruc-
tions for a demanding workout sche-
dule over the summer, and he
believes that the commitment that
was made to that program will be
very important.

“The people that come in ready to
play are going to be in a really good

Collier adds Goldberg  
as volleyball assistant

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer ‘

Head women’s volleyball
coach Shelton Collier has added
Barry Goldberg as a graduate
assistant coach. Goldberg is a
I980 graduate of nearby Pea-
body High School and a 1984
Pitt graduate. According to C01-
lier, his local ties will be an asset
to the program.

“Barry is from Pittsburgh and

went to Pitt, so that’s a good-

situation in that we have some-
one that was happy here, likes it
here and can recruit here,” said
Collier. “I think that we will
work well together, and that’s the
main thing you look for in an
assistant.”

for the men's volleyball club at
Pitt from‘ 1981 to 1984.. Upon
graduation he moved to Califor-
nia, where he was living when
Collier offered him the position.
_ “This is the greatest opportun-
ity that I had offered to me, and
that’s the reason why I came
back from California — to go
back to school and learn more
about volleyball,” said
Goldberg.

During his time as player-
coach of the men’s club team,
Goldberg became good friends
with the members of the women’s
team. Does he foresee any diffi-
culties now that he will be their

Smith, Lane

shine in festival

A trio of Pitt basketball players
returned home from the recently
completed National Sports Festival
in Baton Rouge, La.

Freshman Jerome Lane’s North
squad brought home the g medal,
and sophomores Charles S ith and
Demetreus Gore were members of
the bronze medal-winning squad.

Lane scored 35 points and
grabbed 22 rebounds over four
games for the North squad. He had a
high game of 11 points against the
East squad that included Smith and
Gore. “Jerome had a fine, fine tour-
nament,” said Panther coach Roy
Chipman. “I think he opened some
eyes with his play.” Kris Plonsky,
publicity director for the basketball
competition, said, “Jerome had a
super tournament. He was very
exciting to watch. He’s going to be a
heck of a basketball player."

Smith, last year’s Big East Fresh-
man of the Year, started slowly in
the tournament, scoring 12 points in
two East losses. He then began the
dominant play people expected,
scoring 13 points in an East win over
the West and then a team-leading 16
points in the bronze-medal game —
also a win over the West. _ '

A “The first two games I was press-
ing too hard, trying to do too much
too soon,” said Smith of his perfor-
mance. “The ﬁnal two games I
settled down quite a bit and just
played my game.” ,_

His Pitt counterpart on the East
squad, Demetreus Gore, also had a
productive tournament. Gore
scored 16 points against the West for
his tournament high and also col-
lected five rebounds during the same
game. He had 12 points in the
bronze medal game, and had a total
of 40 points over four games.

“It felt like I was back at one of

, those high school all-star camps,”

said Gore. “Everybody _down there
seemed to be a super player. I was a
little too streaky at times, but overall
I was satisfied with the way I
played." _
In'Detroit over the summer, Gore
worked on his shooting and defense.
He shot 300 jumpers a" day and said

i he concentrated strictly on defense

in his summer league play. He even
had the challenge of having to
defend against the Pistons’ All-NBA
guard Isiah Thomas in one contest.
When asked by how many points
Thomas had beaten him, Gore said,
“I'm not quite sure, but I think it was
under 50.”

year, four Pitt tight ends accounted
for a total of just 19 receptions col-
lectively for the entire season. In
1983, Clint Wilson alone caught 2]
passes. Well, 1985 marks Wilson’s
return. The 6-3, 230-lb. senior was
sidelined the entire 1984 season with
a stress fracture in his foot but seems
to be ready to resume the old form
that gained him attention as an All-
America candidate going into last
year.

“It sure is nice to have Clint back,”
said Fazio. “He is a guy that‘ can
catch a lot of passes.” That’s for
sure, and you can bet it means some
different responsibilities for oppo-
nents’ linebackers this year. His
presence will keep the linebackers
from keying on the run and blitzing,
and it will give John Congemi a
wider selection of receivers to
choose from.

Sophomore David Shuck (6-3,
220) is also in consideration. Shuck,
a strong blocker, developed his pass
receiving during the past year and
now is ready to push Wilson for
playing time.

Both Shuck and Wilson will see
action when Pitt-runs a two-tight-
end offense on short yardage, and
barring injury to either player. the
position is solid.

Projected Starter: Clint Wilson-84.
Grade: A-.'

Receivers — Some analysts see
this positionas the one weak link in
the Pitt offense. I disagree. Perhaps
the only thing lacking here is expe-
rience. There are only two expe-
rienced players: Chuck Scales isone,
and Matt Stennett is the other.

Scales first moved to wide out just
last year after a successful freshman
campaign as a tailback. Stennett
played a good bit two years ago
when Congemi came into his own
but did not see much action last
year, serving as back up to Bill Wal-
lace and Scales. Stennett doubled as

a centerfielder for Pitt’s baseball
team during the spring, so he has
missed the past two spring drills;
Sophomores Dwayne Milloy and
Mike Stewart possess the breaka-
way speed to be good outside receiv-
ers, but neither are proven.
Freshmen Reggie Williams and
Michael Hadley both look good but,
again, are not proven ball players.
The jury is still out on this group,
but a quarterback like Congemi can
have a positive effect on his receiv-
ers. Look what happened to Bill
Wallace when Congemi took over.

“It sure is nice to have Clint
[Wilson] back. He is aguy
that can catch a lot of
passes.”

—— Foge Fazio

This crew could go from rags to
riches real quick.

Overall, the success of this group '

depends on the success of the run-
ning game. Keeping those line-
backers close to t'he line of
scrimmage with a good running
game tends to open up the middle of
the secondary. If that happens, it’s
just fundamentals from that point
on.

Projected Starters: Chuck Scales-22
and Dwayne Milloy-8. Grade: B.

Defense

Interior Defensive Line — Fazio
has created some ,defensive master-
pieces in his time. During his days as
an assistant coach at Pitt, Fazio
directed defenses shut down —- to
name a few: Herschel Walker, Kel-
vin Bryant, D.J. Dozier (twice) and
George Rogers. Of late, however,
the Pitt defense has not lived up to

its traditional prowess.

Last year, Oklahoma’s Lydell
Carr burned the Pitt defense for 137
yards rushing, and Miami’s Alonzo
Highsmith ran for 102 yards against
the Panthers. Until last season, very
rarely did anyone gain over 100
yards rushing against Pitt; twice in
the same season was unheard of.

Fazio is confident, however, that it .

will be just like old times this season.
“We want our defense to return to
the aggressive style of play that was

"our trademark a few years back,"

said Fazio. “We feel our front five
are going to be pretty doggone
good.’.’ With all five starters return-
ing, it is just a matter of everyone’s
remaining healthy.

Leading the charge ‘is middle
guard Dennis Atiyeh. The 6-1, 255-
lb. senior from Allentown will be in
his third season at that position.
Last year, he was the Panthers'lead-
ing pass rusher with eight sacks.

Fellow senior Bob Schilken, his
back up, shared_ time with Atiyeh
two years ago, but he spent part of
last year at defensive end. With
either of them playing, the defense
should be effective.

Flanking Atiyeh on the defensive
line will be Walter Johnson and Bob
Buczkowski at the tackle positions.
Johnson, a 6-2, 250-lb. junior, pos-
sesses an extraordinary blend of
strength and speed. He recorded 50
tackles, which was second on the
defensive line behind Atiyeh.

Buczkowski (6-5, 265), another
senior, has been plagued by injuries
throughout his career. Fazio is high
on Buczkowski, though. “Bob has as
much natural athletic ability as
anybody at that position,” he said.
Buczkowski’s play will definitely
affect the Panthers’ fortunes this
year. Pitt's inexperienced secondary
mandates a strong pass rush.

Senior John Kukalis (6-5, 240)
and junior Lorenzo Freeman (6-5
255), a player who, perhaps, has not

Everything You
Always Wanted to
Know About Rush
 But Were Afraid
to Ask

There are 22 fraternity and
16 sorority chapters on the

-. Pitt campus. Eighteen frater-

nities and 12 sororities partic—
ipate in the _lnterfraternity.
and Panhellenic Council
Rush each year.

Ten of these sororities are
located in Amos Hall on cam-
pus, and two have houses on
Bayard and Bellefield Streets.

Seven of these fraternities
are located in the University
fraternity complex near the
Pitt Stadium, and five others
have houses near the cam-
pus. Six chapters do not own
houses, but many brothers
choose to live together in
Oakland and keep the frater-
nity traditions alive.

You should be able to visit
all - or at least most - of the
chapters during Rush.

Fraternity Open Rush lasts
from Sept. 5 to 10, and this is
the time, “When rushees can
go around to each of the fra-
ternities and check out what
the (chapters) are about,
what they stand for and what
they do,” according to Steve
Fox, who holds a chairman-
ship with the lnterfraternity
Council.

The fraternities are prohi-
bited from serving alcohol to
rushees during Open Rush,
and the activities concentrate
on getting to know what the
fraternities mean, what they
entail and what the brothers
are like.

“It’s the best time for the
rushee to ask about the ﬁnan-
cial obligations they would
have to incur, what kind of
academic standing a frater-

nity has and what kind of
functions it holdis/‘Fox said.

reeks.

Fox offers the following
advice for men going through
fraternity rush:

“Get to know the brothers,
and find out as much informa-
tion as you can about the
fraternity.

“Don’t try to put on a false
image. If you’re serious about
fraternity, the brothers want
to know you as you are.

“Visit as many (chapters)
as you possibly can to get a
good ﬂavor of what the frater-
nity system is like.

“Learn the locations of the’
houses, because they’re all
over campus.

“Get in touch with the fra-
ternities that do not have
houses by calling the IFC

' Office at 624-5904.”!

Sorority rush is more
structured than fraternity
rush.» A rush counselor to
each rushee answers ques
tions and take her through
Open House functions.

During Open House, “All
rushees will visit all the sorori-
ties,” said Dawn Funk, Inter-
nal Vice President of the
Panhellenic Council.

“Every sorority has a par-
ticular theme in Greek life,
like scholarship, philan-
thropy, history, Homecom-
ing or Greek Week,” Funk
said. ”Each of the sororities’
livingrooms will be deco-
rated for that theme. They
won’t be representing just
their sorokrity but all the
sororities in that theme,

“The sororities are uniting
to promote Greeks,” she

said.

For the 8-round“ parties,
you, the- rushee, pick the
eight sororities you want to
go back to.

When it comes to the 4-
round parties, you and the
sororities will be narrowing
down. They pick the rushees
they would like to come back
to the sorority, and you will
pick four sororities you want
to visit again. '

For the Final Parties, the
sorority invites girls whom
they "are considering for
membership, and the rushee
picks the sororities she is
considering joining.

“Then through a process in A

Panhel,” Funk said, “you pick I
the two sororities you would
like to join (ranking them by
preference) and are given
one bid.

“Rush can be a very nerve-
racking time,” she said.
“What should I say? What
should I wear? What if they
don’t like me?”

Although she emphasizes
that acceptance into sorori-
ties is not based on popular-
ity or looks, Funk offers some

rush tips to ease those pre-
party jitters:

“Be yourself. People can
spot a phony a mile away.
Don’t be afraid that who you
are won’t be acceptable. Sor-
ority members come from a
variety of backgrounds, so
just be you!

“Ask questions. The best
way to discover if a sorority
or even Greek life are right
for you is asking questions.
No question is too silly. If you
feel uncomfortable asking a
sorority sister a certain ques-
tion, your Panhellenic rush
counselor (who is a sorority

member) will answer all of .

your questions.

“Be on time to rush parties.
Sororities need responsible

Promptness shows reliabil-

“Have fun! You are the

Dear
New Students...

Dear New Students,
Congratulations on your
decision to attend the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. Whileyou
have made this one Impor-
tant decision, you will be
faced with many more ‘during
the next few years. What you
choose to do outside of the
academic walls of the Univer-
sity will be just as important
as what you do within. For
this reason, I invite you to
explore the possibility of
Greek life—membership in a
fraternity or sorority.
Greek life offers a multi-
tude of opportunities and
involves you in all aspects of
campus life. From homecom-
ing to intramurals to socials
to charity projects, the
Greeks are a part of it all.
Whether you are a commuter
or resident student, fraterni-
ties and sororities provide
you with a “home away from
home” atmosphere that will
make Pitt “your” university.
Rush — the rucruitment of

new members - begins the I

first week of school. By par-
ticipating in rush, you will
meet many new friends and
discover what Pitt’s fraterni-
ties and sororities have to
offer you. Whether or not
you decide to join is up to
you. However, only if you
decide to participate will
you know if fraternity/soror-
ity life is for you.

We hope to see you during
rush. Best wishes for a suc-
cessful term!

Sincerely,

Bridget S. Guernsey

Thoughts from a
Commuting Greek
By Stacy Weisberger

I pledged a sorority in my
Junior year, and I think that
was one of the best choices I
could have made in college. I
am a commuter, and my sor-
ority is a home away from
home.

Especially for commuters,
the winter is a rough time to
be travelling to and from
school. There have been
many nights when I made
the comfortable sorority
living room my bedroom!

Sorority is a place to meet
new friends, socialize, and a
place to grow. You can even
hold an office - I became
Secretary soon after I was
initiated! '

In between classes you
always have a place to go,
and there’s always someone
to study or grab a quick lunch
with - or just sit and talk.
Someone has usually taken‘
the class you are having prob-
lems with, and they are willing
to help.

When you commute to‘ ‘

such a large college, it's easy
Co feel lost. Greek life truly
gives you a home-, and your
brothers or sisters really are
family.

So, Go Greek! It’s a good

_ choice!

Greeks...The Real
Story

Bluto picks a cream dough-
nut from his cafeteria tray,
stuffs it into his mouth, chews
it for a few seconds, then
pushes his cheeks together.
Chewed-up doughnut sprays
all over those sitting with him,
and he ‘ calls this pheno-
menon, “A giant zit.”

He has proved, once again,
that fraternity members are
basically disgusting slobs.

He then joins the brothers
back at the fraternity house,
where they drink cases of
beer and plot how to destroy
the university. But why stop
with the university? they ask.
Why not wreck the whole
town?

Such is the stuff good
‘movies are made of, but the
way Greeks really are - Espe-
cially on the Pittcampus —— is
usually not portrayed on the
silver screen.

Misconceptions about.

Greeks predominate high
schools and non-Greek life.
Haven’t you ever heard that
fraternity brothers make
pledges do things like eat live
goldfish and wear funny
clothes?

That most brothers are
barely passing college, or
ﬂunking out of it, because
they do nothing but hold wild
parties every night and drink
the leftover beer during the
day?

That ‘ sorority girls are
snobby, don’t associate with
girls outside of their own sor-
ority, and don’t participate in
any campus organizations?

We’ve all heard these
myths. Now let’s examine
The Real Story 

Membership to Greek
organizations is based on
who you are, and no member
will ask a rushee how much
money his or her father
makes, request body mea-
surements or scrutinize a
pledge’s wardrobe. (See
Dawn Funk and Steve F ox’s
comments in “Everything
You Always Wanted to Know
About Greeks But Were
Afraid to Ask”.)

In addition, Greeks are not
anti-social or exclusive to
independents or outside
organizations. (See “You’ll
Find Greeks All Over Cam-
pus!” for a list of just some of

I I the campus leaders who are

Greek.)

Most of all, they are young
men and women who are
dedicated to the ideals of
their organization and of
Greek life. ~

Eliminating hazing across
the country is one of these
ideals. Pitt’s Student Govern-
ment Board joined the Inter-
fratemity Council (IFC) and
Panhellenic Association in a
letter-writing campaign to the
Pennsylvania House of
Representatives to pass an
anti-hazing bill.

The proposed House Bill
749 defines hazing as, -“Any
action  whichrecklessly or
intentionally‘ endangers the
‘mental or physical health or
safety of a student.” Viola-'

!‘ Paid Advertisement!

tions would by considered
third-degree misdemea-
nors. The bill also forces all
colleges in the state to have
an anti-hazing policy. Pitt
has such a policy, but many
colleges do not.

Pitt’s policy forbids, “Any
hazing ceremony, activity or
practice. This includes all
types of corporal punish-
ment, any action that would
place a person in peril, any

action which involves physi- '

cal exhaustion or abuse, any
activity of a rude, or degrad-
ing or dangerous nature, any
activity which would interfere
with a person’s ability to per-

‘ form college work, or other

activity which would reﬂect
unfavorably on the fraternity
and sorority system.”
Violations of this policy can
result in a hearing, and the
university will contact the fra-

'ternity or sorority’s

national office. ‘

Greeks are as committed
to reducing alcohol-related
problems as they are to elimi-
nating hazing. The universi-
ty’s alcohol policy for the
Greek system prohibits
anyone under 21 from pos-
sessing or consuming alcohol
and the furnishing of alcohol
to anyone underage.

The IF C instituted the pol-
icy of “dry rush’? a few years
ago, and it has proved quite
successful. This policy pro-
hibits the serving of alcoholic
beverages to rushees during
Open Rush.

(Because of national Pan-I

hellenic rules, alcohol tradi-
tionally is not served at
sorority rush functions.)
Representatives from
three national fraternities
held a workshop at Pitt last
fall to discuss “dry rush”.
“You’re actually rushing

the brothers, not coming to’

the party for a beer,” said
Greek Adviser Bridget
Guernsey of dry rush. “It pro-
motes the aspects of the fra-
ternity besides the social. We
know about the social. Now
they have a ‘chance to
emphasize the type of activi-
ties they have a great time
doing and don’t need
alcohol.”

“Why Dry Rush?” was ans-
wered by Lambda Chi Alpha
alumni Ronald J. Bangs in
Cross and Crescent, the fra-
ternity’s national magazine."

“Members should be
asked whether they truly feel
that alcohol needs to be there
for successful recruitment,”
Bangs wrote, “or if it needs to
be there in order to make
rush an enjoyable party-time

"for brothers, during which

they try to pull in some pros-
pective members.

“Which is more impor-
tant,” he asked, “getting to
know the person, or learning
how he parties? If the‘chap-
ter’s standards mean any-
thing, the answer should be
obvious.” _

“Dry rush” helps put all fra-
ternities on an equal level,
with sober, alert rushees and
brothers who have to pro-
mote their fraternityyon the
basis of things other than

how great their parties are.

“Thus, rush becomes peo-
ple rushing people, rather
than alcohol and parties rush-
ing people,”'Bangs wrote.

Drinking and driving don’t
mix - we’ve heard that often -
but students sometimes find
themselves relaxing after a
hard exam with a couple
drinks, or drowning their sor-
rows in a pitcher.

' Fraternity Phi Gamma
Delta at Pitt is trying to help
all students who find them-
selves in such situations. Last
year, they established Broth-
ers Against Drunk Driving
(BADD) to teach others
about the dangers of alcohol
abuse.

BADD held an alcohol
awareness workshop last
term in which a lawyer dis-
cussed the legal implications
of alcohol abuse, and the Stu-
dent Health Center showed a
tape about alcohol aware
ness.

Going into the high schools
to discuss the responsibilities
one must assume when they
drink is just one of BADD’s
many plans. _

They don’t get drunk every
night, they don’t make their
pledges make fools out of
themselves, they don’t pad-
dle, they don’t even swallow
live goldfish! What do the
Greeks do for fun?

Everything!

Guernsey said people in
fraternities and sororities are,
“Those who are interested in
participating in all aspects of
university life. Charity,
sports, ‘going to football

games together, Homecom- _

ing - it’s much more fun doing
it as a group.”

The highlight of the year
for the_Greek community is

when they get to help the out-

side community Greek
Week. During Greek Week,
the fraternities and sororities

A are divided into groups which

compete for points, but still
work together for a common
cause.

Greek Week activities
include Greek Sing (song and
dance contest), foodeating
contest, 2-hour dance mara-
thon and a blood drive.
Greek Week traditionally
comes to a close with the

_Greek Formal, at which all

the winners are announced.
Over $50,000 was raised
for Eye and Ear Hospital dur-
ing Greek Week last year.
Former Greek Week chari-
ties include Family House
and the Arthritis Foundation.

Greeks are continually

“I feel good about our quarter-
back situation. Johnny Congemi is
our quarterback. Joe Felitsky had a
good spring, but he still has a lot to
prove. John Cummings has expe-
rience; he’s a ﬁfth-year guy and if
needed, I'm sure he'll be ready to
perform.” .

I — Head Coach Foge Fazio

Ask any of the Pitt coaches what it
will take to reverse last year's embar-
rassing 3-7-1 record, and chances are
that his answer will begin with a
healthy John Congemi.

Congemi went into the 1984 sea-
son as the starting quarterback, but
was hampered by a variety of injur-
.ies and never fully recovered until

season he was replaced at different
times by John Cummings, Dante
Wiley and Chris Jelic. As a result,
the Panther offense experienced dif-
ficulty moving the football with any
consistency and ﬁnished the season
averaging only 16 points per game.

Congemi, now in his senior sea-
son, is healthy and looking to avenge
last year’s disappointment. “I
learned a lot last year,” he said, “a lot
that I didn't want to know. But I’m

glad I went through it with a year to

k I think that will help us.”

using a different means than last
year. Offensive coordinator Chuck
Stobart came to Pitt from Utah in
the spring touting a new game plan.
“He's really revamped the offense,”
said Congemi. “We’re going to be a
little more unpredictable and I’m
not going to be in the pocket.
Instead, I’ll be all over the place, and

Along with a new offense comes a

the Penn State game. During the

guarded optimism among the team.
Said Congemi, “I think it's a lot like
the '83 season. No one really knows
what to expect, but we know i-f we
work hard and do the things we’re
capable of doing, we have a chance
for a very successful season.”

The aftermath of a 3-7-1 record is
usually reﬂectd in the polls the fol-
lowing season. In the 1984 pre-
season, the Panthers were rated as
high as third. Most of the 1985 polls

do not l-ist Pitt among the top 20.

Will that omission mean less pres-
sure for Congemi and his
teammates?

“There’s less pressure, but there’s a
different kind of pressure, ” Congemi
said. “I think the fans are going to
come out,'and if we don’t get a first
down on the first series, the, boo
birds might be out again. But that’s
something you just have to put
away; it happens in every walk of
life. I just want to get out there and
be successful this season.” A success-
ful 1985 football season will depend
on a healthy John Congemi.

With Congemi assured the start-
ing quarterback job, the backup
position will fall to either senior
John Cummings or sophomore Joe
Felitsky. On the basis of spring prac-

_tice, Felitsky seemed to have a lock

on it, but Cummings has narrowed
the gap during fall camp.

Cummings’ career at Pitt is puz-
zling. He began the 1983 season as
the starting quarterback, and led the
team to a 13-3 upset of Tennessee in
the opening game.But he suffered a
broken collarbone on the finalplay
of the game and was redshirted that
year.

Congemi won the starting job last
season, but when he was injured
against Brigham Young and Okla-
homa, Cummings relieved him‘ late
in each game. He started against
Temple, but was replaced in the

second half by Dante Wiley and was
not used the rest of the season.

Whatever the reasons for his
benching last season, Cummings is
holding no grudge. “I’m not bitter,”
he said. “You can’t be pleased with
what happened, but I try not to let it
bother me too much.

“They make the decisions who
plays and they decided that I wasn’t
going to be one of the persons who
played. I had to live with it and that’s
all I can do," Cummings said. “I’m
just going out there and trying my
hardest and, hopefully, I'll get a
chance to play.”

Injuries have also hampered Joe
Felitsky. He played only half a sea-

son in each of hisjunior and senior ‘

years at Central Catholic High
School. An intestinal illness caused
him to sit out his freshman year at
Notre Dame in I983. He transferred
to Pitt in 1984, and is looking to
provide backup help to Congemi.

The injuries that he suffered in
high school were considered serious,
but he’s healthy now. “They were
injuries that could be built up and
I’m faster now than I ever was,” said
Felitsky.-“I wear a lot of protective
gear to help me and I’m not gun-shy,
as I thought I would be. I don’t even
think about it.”

Ever since his high school days he
was compared to another Central
Catholic and Pitt graduate, Dan
Marina, in size and ability. In fact, if
he were able to slip on the number
13, you would swear it was Marino.
Their size and body movements are
that much alike. Do the compari-
sons bother him? .

“No, I’ve adjusted to it. It’s been
with me for four years, so I’ve gotten
used to it and the only thing it can do
is help me. It’s not going to hurt me,”
he said. If the comparisons are wa_r_-

ranted, then Pitthasia quarterback

for the future.

 

John Congemi (15) leads theWI’anther offense., while Joe Felitsky (21) and _
john Cummings (10) back him up.

lived up to his potential yet, provide
the depth at tackle.

‘Overall, the defensive line should
be awesome, but it is going to have
to be. On September 14, perhaps the
most important game of the year,
the Panthers travel to Ohio State.
Buckeye quarterback Jim Kartsatos
will be starting legitimately for the
first time in his collegiate career. To
be blunt, the Panther defense must
dominate the line of scrimmagein

order to win. It must shut down tail-,

back Keith Byars and get up in Kart-
satos’ face so he has no time to set
up. The Panthers of old always met
this kind of challenge; the Panthers
of present must also. If they beat
Ohio State, there "could be -no stop-
ping them.

The Panthers live or die, right
here on the defensive line.

Projected Starters: Bob Bucz-
kowski-95, Dennis Atiyeh-40 and

_ Walter Johnson-59. Grade: A.

Defensive Ends — The defensive
ends were included in Fazio’s
remark about the front five. They
are very good. Junior Tony Woods
(6-4, 235) and senior Bill Sapio (6-1,
218) are both experienced and tal-
ented, but once again, the Panthers
must avoid injury at this position.
The backups are inexperienced, and
an injury to either Sapio or Woods
would cause problems. Jon Carter
(6-5, 250), a sophomore who played
tackle last year, has the physical
abilities to be a good one, but must
first get the finer points of his new
position down. A

Again, the play of the ends will be
a large part of Pitt’s success this
year. Remember when Hugh Green
and Ricky Jackson were the ends?
It’s the difference between success
and failure. It’s the play of Pitt’s

j front ﬁve.

Projected Starters: Tony Woods-90

and Bill Sapio-92. Grade: B.
Linebackers — For the past two

seasons, Steve Apke has been the

youngster" who filled in wherever

needed. On New Year’s Day, 1984,
Apke made‘ his first collegiate start
in the Fiesta Bowl. He filled in for
the injured Caesar Aldisert and
recorded 14 tackles and recovered a

- fumble.

Last year, he jumped back and
forth between linebacker and end as
injuries depleted the Panther
defense. Still, he recorded 57 tackles
over eight games. Not bad for a
backup.

' But things have changed. Apke
(6-3, 215) has gone from the new kid
on the block to the old man in the
pit. He heads a young but talented
corps of linebackers. Fazio noted,
“Steve Apke is now ready to take

’ Caesar A1disert’s place.” The ques-

tion remains, however, of who will
play beside him. ,
There are several prospects. Lee
Hetrick (6-2, 220), a junior, and
Jerry Wall (6-3, 220), a sophomore,
are the frontrunners — but there are
others to be reckoned with. Matt
LaVigna, Bill McLean and Brian
Shields have all proven tough on

’ special teams in the past and should

contribute at one time or another as
linebackers this season, especially
when Pitt travels to Ohio State.
Projected Starters: Steve ‘Apke-50
and Lee Hetrick-48. Grade: B.

' Secondary — Last year, three
teams — Brigham Young, Navy and
Miami —. passed for over 300 yards
against Pitt. Plain and simple, if the
Panthers are going to win, that can-
not happen this year.

Six of Pit 3 opponents this year
will have quarterbacks who are in
their first year as starters and are
inexperienced. That's the good
news. The bad news is that the other
five teams have proven quarterbacks
who can throw the ball well. That is
why much of the success of this
group will depend on how much
time opposing quarterbacks get to
throw the ball. If it’s more than four
seconds, there could be problems. If
it is under four, this group should be
all right.

Strong safety Bill Callahan (6-0,
200) plays both the pass and run
adeptly. Cornerback Quintin Jones
(6-0, 185) gained some valuable
experience near the end of last sea-
son and is ready now to make a repu-
tation for himself. At the other
corner, -both Ducky Lewis (5-10,
180) and Keith Tinsley (5-11, 185)
had their problems last year, but
Lewis reportedly is much improved
and will nail down the starting job.
At free safety, Bill McCormick (6-1,
185) and Troy Washington (6-2,
190) will battle Teryl Austin (6-1

190) for the job. Both Austin and
McCormick have played in the past,

and either is competent.

This group will be tested right off
the bat when Purdue quarterback
Jim Everett brings his arsenal to Pitt
Stadium on August 31. It could be
the beginning of great things for the
secondary, or it could be the begin-
ning of the end.

Projected Starters: Quintin Jones-7,
Ducky Lewis-4, Bill Callahan-31
and Teryl Austin-19. Grade: C-plus.

KICKING GAME

Placekickers — Pat Viancourt has
been a regular in the Pitt kicking
game since that fateful day at Pitt
Stadium two seasons ago when he
beat Syracuse. He’ll handle the kick-
offs this season, while Mark Brasco
will take the place-kicking chores
and try to improve his six-out-of-14
ﬁeld goal kicking of a year ago. One
bright spot last year was Brasco’s 14

of 14 on PAT’s, he should continue '

on without much trouble. Grade B.

Punters — Problem‘ time. Red-
shirt freshman Dave Cullen was
expected to handle the punting
chores, but he was declared academ-
ically ineligible on August 14. Dante
Wiley had been considered as a pos-
sible candidate, but he took the same
route as Cullen. That leaves two
walk-on freshmen, Bill Rudison and

Bill Smith, to handle the task at

hand.

These two can kick the ball all day
long, but the punting question will
not be answered until the first-time
ll Purdue players rush whomever
wins the job. You may see Pitt going
for it on fourth-and-short this year.
Projected Starters: None. Grade:

“but we can’t afford to rest on past
laurels.” Nehlen need not worry, he
is especially strong at the linebackers
and in the secondary.

Senior Freddie Smalls danced his

_ way to fame last year and is a legiti-

mate All-America candidate this
year at outside linebacker. He tallied
60 solo stops last year. He will be
joined by West Turner on the other
side who is said to be able to do some
great things. It’s just a matter of his
putting his mind to it.

At inside linebacker, junior Matt

_Smith seems to have come into his

own. Another All-America candi-
date, Smith had 93 tackles last year.
Two other veteran linebackers,
Derek Christian and Van Richard-
son, will provide quality and depth.

In the secondary, Nehlen has yet
-another All-America candidate,
Travis Curtis at free safety, and a
slew of experienced players sur-
rounding him.

It is a different story on offense.
Gone are quarterback Kevin White
and fullback Ron Wolfley. John
Talley seems. to be the odds-on
favorite to fill White’s spot, but it is
no sure thing. Last year, Talley had
the job in camp but lost it to Tony
Reda, who lost it to White. Reda is
back this year and will push Talley.

There was a feeling in Morgan-
town that maybe John Talley might
not have the_mental capacity to han-

die the position. Jacques doesn't
agree. “I think that was a rap he
picked up in high school,” said
Jacques. “John Talley has a great
deal of physical ability and can be as
good as anybody in the nation. He
understands the game of football.”
Still, WVU sources indicate that the
talent was there last yeariand he
couldn’t win the starting job, so why

' should he be able to this year. It will

be either Talley or Reda.

The men they will be throwing to
are inexperienced, but the talent is
said to be deep, with as many a six
different wide outs seeing some
action in the course of any given
game. Senior Harvey Smith heads
the recieving corps that includes
four redshirt freshmen.

The offensive line boasts a fourth
All-America candidate in tackle
Brian Jozwiak. As Jacques put. it,
“You just won’t find a better line-
man than Brian.” Maybe not, but
the offensive line is a problem area
for the Mountaineers. They face the

- task of finding two new guards,

which could be a problems. .

In the backfield, a slew of expe-
rienced backs return. John Gay will
man the fullback position, and Pat
Randolph and John Holiﬂeld will
split time at tailback.

West ‘Virginia has one big factor
on their side, the home field. It is

won’t happen. Pitt had beaten WVU
seven years in a row before 1983, and
it is ready to begin a new streak.

The Mountaineers play Maryland
the week before this game, and it will
be difficult for them to execute well
against two good teams, two weeks
in a row. Pitt should shift into high
gear for this game, but it will most
likely be one of the few games that it

USC is synonomous with good
college football, but this is a differ-
ent USC.- South Carolina got over
the hump last year. National Coach
of the Year Joe Morrison guided his
squad to some big victories over, to
name a few, Pitt, Notre Dame,
Clemson, Florida State and.Geor-
gia. His team knows how to win, and
it will be strong again this year.
Returning to wreak havoc on
opposing defensive backs is quarter-
back Mike Hold. One year ago, he
was the NCAA’s answer to Goose
Gossage. Hold came off the bench
three times when the Gamecocks
were trailing and twice while they
were tied (including the Pitt game).

 
 

MCI-)ona'Id“'s 

All five games turned up in the win
column for South Carolina. He
works fast and gets results.
Offensively, the Gamecocks are
confident. “We have a good situa-
tion in the backfield with both talent
and depth,” said USC offensive
coordinator Frank Sadler. “We are
decent at tight end, have an expe-

rienced wide reciever, plus talent .

and a great center who played with a
good group of young offensive line-
men.” He warned, “If we can get
some early game experience for the
young line, we have a good chance
for another good offensive team."
‘On the other side of the ball, the
Gamecocks are relatively young.
Only two seniors will be found on
the first and second team defenses
combined. Defensive coordinator
Tom Gadd says, “If we can perform
to the same standards of the group
that just left, we’ll be all right.”

Gadd, who labeled his defense the
“Fire Ants” due to their swarming
play, returns three of four starters to
the secondary, so they should be
solid back there, as well as at the
linebackers. But the question lies in
the defensive line, where the Game-
cocks were hard hit by graduation.
Only one lineman, Fitzgerald Davis,
has game experience, and that was
limited action.

The inexperience on the line, com-
bined with the fact that South Caro-
lina is at Georgia the week before
this game, should mean a big Pitt
victory. Once again, the Panthers
dominate in the pit.

Prediction: Pitt 42-South
Carolina 10

’ North Carolina State,

October 12, 1985, at Pitt
Stadium. *

North Carolina State coach Tom
Reed really went to town after the
completion of last year. Granted, the
Wolfpack’s 3-8 record did mandate
some alterations, but Reed set two
priorities for himself, and then went
out and took care of both.

The first was to ﬁnd a quarterback
who could step in and play right
away. He went fishing in the junior,
college pool and and came home
-with three, Eric Kramer, Rocky
Mouw and John Heinle. Kramer is
the most talented, and will probably
start.

The second priority was to do
something about the defense. He
went all the way and restructured the
entire unit, switching to a wide-
tackle six. It should help, although it
couldn’t have gotten much worse.
The Wolfpack was dead last in every
defensive category, except passing
defense, in the ACC last year.

State’s new quarterback will be
able to set up behind a strong offen-

_sive line anchored by All-America

candidate Joe Milinichik. Six other
returning starters will be in the
offensive scheme.

State is rebuilding, and unless .it
plays way over its head, it does not
have the power to beat Pitt. The
Wolfpack plays Maryland the week
before, so it might be a little beaten
up. Pitt’s offense should begin to
really click during this game. .

Prediction: Pitt 51-North
Carolina State 21
Rutgers, October 19,
1985, at East Rutherford,
NJ

Rutgers went 7-3 last year with
victories over Temple, Syracuse and
West Virginia. The Scarlet Knights,
under second-year coach Dick An-
derson, are quickly becoming a
power in the East. '

Anderson may be more familiar

to Pitt fans as an assistant to Joe‘

Paterno at Penn State, where he
spent 11 years before taking over at
Rutgers. He reﬂected on last~year’s
successes. “I really didn’t anticipate
that we’d have a 7-3 record when we
started the year,” he said. “We kept
plugging all the time, and I thought
we showed an awful lot of character
and determination.”

Anderson, is counting on that
determination carrying over into

this season a the firm foupgation of ~

Dieffenbach prepares men and women for competition

Women prepare for
conference schedule

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

Just about the only thing that isn’t
good about a year in which you set a
record for having more wins than
any team before you is having to top
it_all the following year.

Geofge Dieffenbach. W0m€I1’S
tennis head coach, finds himself in
that precarious position this year
after his team's record-breaking
1984 season.

What Dieffenbach has on his side.
as he enters his fifth season as Pitt’s
tennis boss, is experience,

Last year the Lady Panthers were
an unknown entity starting three
freshmen in the six available starting
positions. K

This season Dieffenbach is beihg
haunted by the spirit of ’83 as two
team members who played on that
’83 team, butsat out last year, are
back for another season of tennis.
The returners are Miriam Goltz and
Kris Peckman.

Goltz has the pressure of playing
in the No. 1 position this year, but
Dieffenbach believes the MVP of his
squad of two years ago is up to the
challenge.

“Miriam will be at the top of the
lineup. She’s got experience and
she’s proven -she can win in college,”
Dieffenbach said. “It will be nice
having her there.”

If it had not been for the addition
of Goltz and Peckman, the Lady
Panthers could have been in real
trouble this year. ..

Last season’s No. 1 player, Jodi
Levine, has chosen to sit out this

season. As her coach explains, “Jodi
is a very good student in pharmacy
and she wanted to devote more of
her time to her studies this year.”
Levine still has one year of eligibility
remaining and Dieffenbach expects
her to return to the fold in time for
the ‘86 season.

The loss from last season that may "

prove most devastating to the team
is that of former No. 2 Player
Rhonda Gibbs. It was Gibbs who
was the team leader off the court and
on, a perfect role model for the
freshmen last year. Does Dieffen-
bach think anyone can come in and
fill this leadership gap?

“I think Miriam can step in and
fill that void,” the coach answered.
“But Rhonda is a tough player to
replace. She was the type of player
who just went all out and never
quit.”

After the wholesale changes of
Levine to Goltz and Gibbs to Peck-
man in the No. l and 2 spots respec-
tively, the team will look a- lot like
last year's. '

In the No. 3 position will be Julie
Gress, a transfer who missed half of
the 1984 season due to eligibility
problems arising from her transfer.
Having her available for an "entire
season will be a definite plus.

Sophomore Carrie DeVera will be
back at her accustomed position on
court pu_mber f ou_r, where she played
most of her freshman season. De-
Vera is an exciting, at times inspir-
ing, player with as much potential as
any one player on the team. She
could become a player they’ll talk
about for a long time in'Pitt tennis
circles.

George Dieffenbach

On court five this year will be Ste-
phanie Nelson, another returner
from last year's team. A full season
already behind her, Nelson should
have an advantage over less expe-
rienced players she'll face this year.

Rounding out the starting six is
Colleen Driscoll, a part-time player
in ’84. She was still able to gain
invaluable experience last year, at
times playing in the No. 5 slot. Like

Nelson,,Driscoll should find her‘

etperience helpful when she meets
up with freshmen this season.

_The only complete newcomer to
the Lady Panthers this year is Karen
Mead, a freshman from Philadel-
phia.

It 10! It .

Unlike most other college sports,
tennis at Pitt has no formal off-
season program. '

“No, we have nothing organized
during the off-season,"Dieffenbacl_1_
said of off-season training. “The
players are on their own.”

Men ready for Big East
tennis championship

‘ By Bob Travers

Staff Writer

It is one of the oddities of the Big
East that the league plays its men’s
tennis schedulein the spring, but
does not hold league championships
until the following autumn. This
year the championship will be held
in Rhode Island, the weekend of
September 21-22. *

The Pitt Panthers will be there
with the advantage of having last
spring‘s lineup fully intact. “The
guys should be very strong this
year,” said head coach George Dief-
fenbach. “We have a full team back
that tied the Pitt record for wins in a
season, so we’re looking for a real
big year.” '

‘ Dieffenbach, never, known for
pessimism, is unusually optimistic
about the team's fortunes at the Big
East this year. “We have it in our
reach to improve over last year,” he
said. “We did real well against teams
that finished ahead of us last year,
but we had some tough losses. I
think this year could prove to be one
of our best ones ever.” -

The individual Dieffenbach is
counting on more than any other is
his top player, Dave Johnson.
“Johnson isour No. l," Dieffenbach
said. “He’s been doing a real good

job in the tournaments he's been in
this summer, and so have all the
others.”

One more reason for Dieffen-
bach’s exuberant forecast is the
addition this year of freshman Neil

Neyerowich. “He's dynamite,” the
coach said of his team's youngest

'V member. “He's going to be a” great

player. Neil is highly ranked in the
Eastern Tennis Association, which

is the organization that McEnroe '

came out of.” '
Neyerowich will have to wait until
spring to begin to live up to his

advance billing, however. The fall

belongs to the members of last<year‘s

“We have a full team back
that tied the Pitt record for
wins in a season, so we’re

The Pltt‘ News, Orientation Issue - August 30, 1985

Purdue gears up for season opener

When any team prepares for a
football game, one item that remains

a vital part of the preparation is the

film projector. Part of any athlete’s
weekly ritual is a’ few hours in front
of a movie screen, studying the ten-
dencies of the upcoming opponent.
That is not the case in West
Lafayette, Ind.

Following last year’s 3-7-l Pitt
season, some changes were man-
dated. Head coach Foge Fazio ﬁred
coaches Don Thompson, Carmen
Grosso, Dino Folino and Kent
Schoolfield, and replaced them with
Sal Sunseri, John Montgomery,
Trent Walters and Chuck Stobart.
Additionally, quarterback coach
Ron Turner left to take a job at USC
and was replaced by Russ Jacques.
With the change of coaches comes a
change of philosophy, which leaves
Purdue between a rock and a hard
place as far as preparations go.

“They have had so many coaching
changes,” said Purdue head coach
Leon Burtnett, “that we really do
not know what to expect from them,
both offensively or defensively.”

What Burtnett is expecting is a
tough game tomorrow night at Pitt
Stadium. “They [the Panthers] are a
big, strong, explosive type team,” he
continued, “the type of team that
can cause us a lot of problems."

Burtnett had problems of his own
going into this season. With ques-

tion marks in the kicking game and

on the offensive line, could he match
last year’s 7-5 record, which
included victories over Notre Dame,
Ohio State and Michigan? Things
have looked promising so far.
“Overall, the biggest improve-
ment on the team has been the offen-
sive line," said Burtnett. “They had
an excellent two-a-day camp for us.”
Senior Mark Drenth is the only
returning starter in the trenches for
the Boilermakers. Drenth played
guard the last two years but will try

his hand at tackle this year. He is
surrounded by inexperienced upper-
classmen, redshirt freshmen and
newcomers. They face the task of
protecting quarterback Jim Everett.

Everett, a senior from Albu-
querque, N.M., last year became the
first Boilermaker signal caller to
pass for over 3,000 yards in a season.
That is quite an accomplishment
when you take a look at previous
Purdue quarterbacks, including Bob
Greise, Mark Herrmann, Mike
Phipps and Scott Campbell.

He will be throwing to, among
others, tight end Marty Scott. A 6-2
senior, Scott was the second leading
reciever as a junior with 46 grabs for
596 yards. Rick Brunner returns as
the ﬂanker after catching 30 balls
last year, while Steve Griffin, who
set a school record last year with
over 1,000 yards in receptions,
returns at wide reciever.

In the backfield, fellow seniors
Ray Wallace and "Rodney Carter
return. Said Purdue backfield coach
Ray Sherman, “These are two guys
who, since they were freshmen, have
played a lot of minutes for us. I
expect some great things from
them.” He added that Pitt’s defense
will not make his job any easier.

“Pitt’s defense will be a physical
group,” said Sherman. “They have
always played physical. They like to
put a lot of pressure on the backfield
and try to confuse you. That is why
our backs have to be prepared and
know how to handle the pressure."

Defensively, eight starters return
from a unit that ranked dead last in
the Big Ten in pass defense last year.
Free safety Rod Woodson, a two
year starter, leads the way.

Woodson recorded 136 stops last
year to lead all Big Ten defensive

backs. He is said to have Olympic—.

caliber speed, twice winning the Big
Ten 60-yard indoor hurdles. Last
year, in Purdue’s 28-23 upset of

O

 

Ohio State, Woodson had 20 tackles
and a game winning 55-yard inter-
ception return for a touchdown.
Truly a big-game player, the 6-0,
192-lb. junior is looking forward to
the challenge Pitt produces.

“I think they have a lot of talent,”
said Woodson. “We are going to
have to keep them under control.
They can make a some big plays. It is
going to be a great game.”

Elsewhere on defense, the Boiler-
makers are strong. The defensive
front features experienced players at
every position.

The other question mark, kicking,
is the complete opposite of Pitt’s
situation. Purdue is happy with its
punting game but is still skeptical
about its placekicking. Said Burt-
nett, “The punting game has been
good, but our placekicking is not as
strong as we would like. We are not
even near where we were last year at
this time." »

Overall, the Boilermakers will not
have a lot of questions answered
until they take the field tomorrow
night. “Consistency is the thing that
still bothers me about this team,”
said Burtnett. “We have to develope
some kind of consistency.”

Film or no film, Purdue will be
ready to go tomorrow night_.

OOOOO

Purdue-Pitt Comparisons: The-

Boilermakers, like Pitt, have two
weeks after tomorrow night until
their next game. Unlike the Panth-
ers, Purdue plays a weak Ball State
team, while the Panthers play a
tough Ohio State team...Purdue’s
last game was a 27-24 loss to Virgi-
nia in the Peach Bowl. Pitt’s last
game was a 31-11 romp over Penn
State...Purdue holds a 4-1 edge in
the series with Pitt’s only win being a
20-13 victory in 1948.

The Pitt News, Orientation Issue - August 30,

By Bo_b_:l'ravers

Ciive Brian Davis a fair chance before judgment

So here we are again, huh?

After a summer filled with fun and
excitement like a one-day baseball
strike and The Continuing Saga of
Tony the Cowboy, we all find our-
selves safe beneath the friendly
shadow of the Cathedral of
Learning.

All summer long I’ve been getting
these thoughts about sports and
things, and I didn’t know what to do
with them. Most of my thoughts
made very little sense, so I wasn't too
unhappy about it.

Well, thanks to the fine young
men and women who run this news-
paper, I nowhave somewhere to put

my thoughts. The problem is that _

they still don’t make much sense, but
here they are anyway.

* The experts say Brian Davis is
the greatest thing since bubble gum.
A legend before his own time. Just
remember before you write out your
Heisman Trophy party invitations
that Davis has yet to gain a single
yard in college ball. He is not the
first to carry the mantle of being The
Next Tony Dorsett and he probably

will not be the last. ‘lhe hardest thing
in the world to live up to is the expec-
tations that others put on you.

* While I’m on the subject, one
thing that worries me about young
Mr. Davis is that if he does not win
the Heisman and break all sorts of
records, will he be the winner of the
Dan Marino trophy? This is
awarded annually to the Pitt player
who fails to live up to unrealistic
standards imposed on him by fans
and media.

* It seems as though a lot of Pitts-
burgh sports fans are taking some
sort of perverse delight in their new,
mostly self-anointed reputatin of
being a ‘tough sell. The fans here see
anything less than a perennial cham-

pion as being wholly unworthy of.

their support. Let’s face it — we all
got cocky after ’79; now nothing less
will do. The problem is this is how
cities lose teams. (Remember
Baltimore?)

' * The only winners in the Great
Baseball Strike of ’85 were Peter
“The-Man-Can-Do-No-Wrong”
_Ueberroth the Toronto Blue Jays

and ushers in 26 major-league cities.

* The losers: Both the players and
owners, who did nothing more than
enhance their image of being both
greedy and stupid; the Pirates, who
have to keep playing; their fans, who
are occasionally reminded that the
Pirates are still playing baseball; and
whoever dresses the players’ union
negotiator, Don Fehr.

* You would think that Tony
Dorsett would have taken at least
one course in basic tax law during
his four years here. Maybe it would
have been enough to avoid this
whole ugly mess if somebody had
taken Tony aside and just said, “No,
Tony, you can’t keep it all.”

* Show me a network that wanted
to move the Pitt-Purdue game to
night in order to televise it, and I’ll
show you a network that is in dire
need of some quality Saturday night
programming. '

* If Pitt’s basketball team finishes '

less th'an4t_hird in the Big East this
year, it will be a disappointment.
Syracuse and Georgetown may top
the Panthers in overall depth, but

Ditt Droaram Council
would like to extend to everyone
  the onnortunitv to take an active

Pitt is in much better shape going
into the season than graduation-
r_av_aged  John’s, Villanova and
Boston College.

* If incoming center Tico Cooper
can _do for the Pitt basketball team
what his advance billing says he can,
Pitt may well ﬁnish higher than
third.

* Why can’t John Congemi play
as well in the first 10 or 11 games of a
season as he does in the final game of
the year? If Congemi could ever put
together a season full of performan-
ces like the ’84 Fiesta Bowl and last
year’s Penn State game, he would be
All-American and Pitt would never
lose a game.

* It’s Congemi’s job to lose, but if
he can’t come through at quarter-
back this year, word has it that
Notre Dame transfer‘ Joe Felitsky is
more than ready to step in and take
over the job.

* If you want to see somebody
cringe, just ask anyone in_the Pitt
athletic department what the real
‘story is behind last year‘s departures

“Sally and Judy have won a whole

see that they have expectations of

ever. He is quick to point out the
huge contribution he expects from
them. ‘‘If our freshmen don’t play
well, then we’re not going to win,” he
said. “So there is going to be some

_ pressure on them to some degree.

But they are good, so they should fit
in real well.”

The Lady Panthers’ schedule is
laced with top-caliber teams. During
the month of September they will

meet 24 opponents, including Stan- ‘

ford, rated No. 2 last year, and Illi-
nois State, which was No. 12. Other
potential Top-20 teams scheduled
that month are Michigan, Michigan
State and Illinois-Chicago.
“We have a lot of tough matches

think we have a shot at.”

matter who we're playing, they
expect to win.”

The Lady Panthers finished the

-make their stay in the NCAA tour-

nament a little bit longer.

Here is a rundown of the 1985
Lady Panthers and how each player
is expected to contribute according
according to head ‘coach Shelton

Collier:

Carolyn Brown: 5-6 sophomore
defensive specialist from Conneaut

Lake, Pa. “A hardworking defensive ‘

specialist who has improved a great

deal and should be ready to contrib-

ute even more than last season.”
Noreen Coughlin: 5-ll sopho-

more middle blocker from Shore-
ham, N.Y. “She was an excellent
middle blocker at the Air Force
Academy last year, and her transfer
to Pitt will help us out a great deal,
particularly at the net.”

Denise Frawley: 5-10 freshman
outside hitter from Thornwood,
N.Y. “She was rated as the No. l
recruit on the East Coast. She is a
powerful and exciting outside spiker
who has a lot to learn but has excep-
tional potential. She could be one of
the most talented players to ever
come into the Pitt program.”

Sally Gillespie: 5-4 senior back-
court specialist from Irwin, Pa.
“Sally is our emotional leader and
the heartbeat of our team. She will
keep driving herself and everyone
around her to play hard, have fun
and win.”

Sue Hoover: 5-8 junior middle
blocker from Johnstown, Pa. “I
expect Sue to be the No. l spiker in
the Big East Conference, . perhaps
the entire East. She proved last year
that she is a national-caliber spiker
and will be ready to do even more
this year.”

Norma Mulvihill: 5-ll freshman
middle blocker from Irwin, Pa.
“Nora was the No.1 recruit in Pen-
nsylvania and the only Pennsylvania
player to make the elite Fabulous 50
Recruits. We expect her to take the
middle blocking position vacated by
All-America Ulana Kohutiak on the
first day of practice and for the next
four years as well.”

Louise 0‘Shaughnessy: 5-9
sophomore outside hitter from Mis-
sissauga, Canada. “After being
voted Most Improved Player last
year and earning. a starting role as a
freshman, Louise should have a
great sophomore season. I expect
her to surprise a lot of people in how
good she actually becomes.”

Lisa Stewart: 5-9 sophomore out-
side hitter from Farrell, Pa. “She is
an experienced player who trans-
ferred from the nationally successful,

ble this season. She is a potentially
dominant spiker who has proven she
can compete with the nation’s best.”

Dris Wexell: 5-4 junior outside
hitter from North Huntingdon, Pa.
“Among all these taller players, Kris

will be counted on heavily to play

great defense, serve for a _lot of
points and be a leader on the court.
She should be our stabilizing
factor.”

returning players. Quarterback
Rusty Hochberg is back for his
senior year and is expected to recieve
All-America consideration. Four
starters from the offensive line also
return to provide some protection,
as will running backs Albert Smith
and Vernon Williams.

Defensively, Anderson has 16 of
his top 22 players back from last
year. Linebacker Tyrone Stowe will
anchor the defense. Pitt has played
Rutgers only twice, and the Rutgers
defensive unit did not show up either
time. Pitt has outscored Rutgers by
a total of 99-9 through both games.

It will be close, but another win
for the Panthers. Rutgers plays
Penn State, Boston College and

Temple the three weeks prior to’

meeting Pitt, and that kind of sche-
dule should catch up with them
sooner or later.

Prediction: Pitt 31-Rutgers

Navy, October 26, 1 985,
at Annapolis, Maryland

One of the most disheartening
games for Pitt last year was the 28-28
tie with the Naval Academy at Pitt
Stadium. Leading 28-14 with just
under two minutes left in the game,
the Panthers proceeded to fall apart
as the Midshipmen rallied to tie the
score as time ran out.

Navy quarterback Bill Byrne
threw for 340 yards that afternoon,
and he is back, but he will be joined
in the backfield by All-America
Napolean McCallum. McCallum
redshirted last year after breaking
his ankle early in the season but is
said to be back in top shape. Two
years ago, McCallum led the nation
in all-purpose running and was third
in rushing. His accomplishments
include a 172-yard rushing day
against Pitt, but things may not be
that easy thisyear.

Navy coach Gary. Tranquill faces
the task of developing a whole new
offensive line, having lost all seven
starters from last year. That means

McCallum may not have any holes
through which to run. In addition,
the top five receivers have gradu-

ated, leaving Byrne and McCallum.

as really the only experienced per-
sonnel on the offense. Defensively,
there are nine starters returning,
with the linebacking corps and the
secondary especially strong.

It will be nine years ago this year
that Tony Dorsett shattered Archie
Griffin’s all-time rushing mark in
this same stadium. Look for Charles
Gladman to celebrate the anniver-
sary with a big day as Pitt sends
Navy to the lifeboats.

Prediction: Pitt 28-Navy 7
Syracuse, Novembera,
1985, at Pitt Stadium

Last year, Syaracuse defeated
Pitt, 13-7, for the first time since
1972. The Orange defense shut down
the Pitt offense, and once again this
year, defense will be the name of the
game for Syracuse. “We don't have
the experience,” said head coach
Dick MacPherson, “but we may
have more talent than ever.”

Start with All-America candidate
and team captain Tim Green. Green,
a senior defensive tackle, is a top
candidate for the Outland and Lom-
bardi Trophys. He will be joined by
sophomore Ted Gregory at nose
guard and Wes Dove at -the other
tackle.

Linebacking is solid with Rudy
Reed, Tim Pidgeon and Lynwood
Alford, and the only question mark
seems to be the secondary, where
three’ starters graduated. Still, the

Orange have plenty of talent back,

there, it's just a matter of developing
it. V

On offense, quarterback Todd
Norley returns,-but that’s about it.
Leading rusher Jamie Covington
has departed, along with three offen-
sive linemen, and just as last year,
the offense seems to be the problem
area.

Last year, even though the Orange
defense allowed only a touchdown
or less in seven games, Syracuse only

Rudy Reed -
managed to wfn five of those games
because their offense didn’t put any
points on the board.

During the three weeks before the
Orangemen play Pitt, they host
West Virginia, Penn State and Tem-
ple, a schedule that should soften
them up. The Panthers avenge last

years loss.

Predi_c_tion: Pitt 24-
Syracuse 9

Temple, Novembe:
1985, at Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania

Temple coach Bruce Arians is

‘ entering his third year as head coach

of the Owls, and already he has
accomplished something no other
Owl coach has done since 1945. He
beat Pitt. It happened last year,‘ a
13-12 upset at Veterans Stadium.
The most exciting thing that hap-
pened that afternoon for the Pitt
fans who attended the game was
when the Beach Boys played after
the game. '
Arians is not short on talent on
the team. He returns 48 lettermen
from last year’s 6-5 squad. But he
does have a tough schedule, includ-
ing Penn State, Brigham Young,
Boston College and West Virginia.

“MOST STUDENTS DON'T KNOW
THAT ARMY ROTC LEADS TO

Running back Paul Palmer
returns to anchor the backfield with
quarterback Lee Saltz. Both per-
formed well last year. Saltz was 12-
13 against Pitt for 177 yards, while
Palmer had scored Temple's only
touchdown against the Panthers on
a six-yard run. The offensive line is
solid behind All-America candidate
John Rienstra at guard.

On the other side of the ball, the
Owls Wlll try to improve on last
year’s national No.—2l ranking in
total defense, but they must replace
All—American Anthony Young at
safety. Linebacker Todd Bowles will
most likely become the dominant
player in the Temple defense.

Last year, Temple caught Pitt at
the right time, just after losses to

BYU and Oklahoma. This year, they .

are catching the Panthers at the
wrong time. A big win for Pitt as the
Panthers gear up for Penn State.

Prediction: Pitt 23-Temple

Penn §tate, November 23,

1985. at Pitt Stadium

How many times has this hap-
pened? Pitt goes into this game with
a 10-0 record, Penn State enters with
a comparable record, and not only is
this a battle for Eastern supremacy,
but also a game with National
Championship considerations.

Penn State, following its 6-5 sea-
son of a year ago, is in a position to
do rebound, as Pitt should. With a
defensive unit that returns 19 of the
top 22 players, head coach Joe
Paterno has a new lease on life. “It’s
like taking a new job,”says the veter-
an coach. “We are going to start
from scratch. We have a new staff,

‘ and we have an open mind about the

players and their positions.”

. One position that Paterno will
definitely have to keep an open mind
about is quarterback. Gone is last
year’s starter, Doug Strang, but
returning is back—up QB John
Shaffer. Shaffer was 40-96 last year
for 534 yards, but thejob will not be
handed to him. He must first beat,

“In your last two years of
ROTC, you receive $100 a month.
The way I see it, ROTC is pay—
ing you mone and you just give the
Army back a little of your time.
When I get out of the Army, my

And b

out fellow junior Matt Knizner, who
has one hand on the job.

The receivers are experienced.
Split ends Herb Bellamy, last year’s
leading reciever (16-306), and
George Alpert (6-1 19) return, as well
as tight ends Dean Dimidio(l1-184)
and Brian Siverling (8-86).

In the backfield, D.J. Dozier
returns for his junior year and w-ill
look to return to the form he
revealed his freshman year when he
rushed for 1,002 yards. , Dozier
slipped to 713 yards last year after
injuries put him out for a few games,
but he still averaged over ﬁve yards
every time he touched the ball. Steve
Smith returns at fullback.

On defense, All-America strong
safety candidate Michael Zordich
anchors a secondary that features
returning starters Ray Isom at free
safety and Lance Hamilton at
cornerback.

At linebacker, Shane Conlan
returns along with Rogers Alex-
ander and Trey Bauer. Mike Russo
will again anchor the defensive line.

Paterno warns, though, “We may
have an experienced squad, butafter
nine games when you get shellacked
like we did last year, experience can’t
have much to do with what hap-
pened.” Paterno is speaking of con-
secutive late-season losses to Notre
Dame (44-7). and Pitt (31-11) that
put damper on what had been a suc-
cessful year, up until that point.

Penn State finishes with Notre
Dame and Pitt again this year, but
the result will not be the same as last
year. We’ve seen it happen before,
and it will happen again. Penn State
will ruin a banner year for the
Panthers.

Pitt will push them all over the
field, but in the end, it won’t be in the
cards for the Panthers. Look for the
lack of a Pitt punter to be the differ-
ence. Penn State wins on big plays,
maybe even a blocked punt. But
you’ll be able to watch the Panthers
play again on New Year’s Day.

Prediction: Penn State 23-
