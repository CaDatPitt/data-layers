New year
will bring
lowered

drink tax

by Laura Powers
For t/2e Pitt Newt!

Allegheny County Chief Execu-
tive Dan Onorato announced in a
press conference yesterday that he
and other officials are now recom-
mending that the drink taxibe re-
duced from 10 percent to 7 percent
effective 1.

According to Onorato spokes-
man Kevin Evanto, the reduction is
being suggested after the tax brought
in more money than expected.

“Our projections are showing
that we will likely bring in about $8
million more in the drink tax than
originally estimated,” said Evanto.

The tax, along with a $2—a—day
levy on car rentals, began injanuary
of this year. The taxes were imple—
mented in an attempt to help 
revenue for Pittsburgh public tran-
sit A ' ~

Evanto said both taxes were orig-
inally estimated to bring in a com-
bined $32 million, with $28 million
_coming from the diink tax itself

Yet, he said the drink tax is now
estimated to bnng in about $36 rnil—
lion on itsown, .

According to Evanto, the tax can-
not be reduced until county council

approves the suggested reduction. If ,
, approved, the county executive will

then have to sign the legislation in,
I Board under then—president Shady

order for it to come into effect

Paint the Panther statues are get-
ting ready to prowl. once again,
although four will retain their cur-
-rent designs. ,

Six ﬁberglass statues, a project
of the 2007 Student Government

Henien, have been spray—painted
gray and will be redecorated ‘by
new student organizations. ,

j The panthersiof Black Action.
Society, Pitt Band, -The Pitt News
and Pitt Pathﬁnders, however, will
not be redecorated.‘ i

The Pathﬁnders  The Pitt
News each bought their panthers
..from SGB for $4,000, -at their .own
requests. -

., SGB adviser Joyce Giangarlo.

As Pitt’s homecoming ap—'

said that the original price of the ‘

statues was about $4,700 each. The
price tag for all 10 panthers from
the Canadian company Heavy In-
dustries was $47,850. Although

, she didn’t have the exact ﬁgures at

hand, Giangarlo said the project
cost about $60,000 in its entirety,

including advertising, painting sup—.

plies and transportation. -0

SGB president Sumter Link,
who voted in favor of the statues
as a board member last year, said
the statues were not sold for less
than their original value. He said
that the board charged the organi-
zations that asked to buy their pan-
thers the amount it would cost to
buy as replacement statue.

“The original idea we had was

that the group could buy it, and

we would get another panther to

’ replace it,” said  “It would

slowly increase [the number] of

panthers without using more of _.

the Student Activities Fund.”

He said the reason why the stat—I
ues cost more last year was because 0
the  purchase included the
mold as well, which increased cost
per statue. The mold remains with
the manufacturer. _ ‘ t

Giangarlo said that the BAS
and Pitt Band statues will-not be
redecorated because of _ their good
designs. SGB did not ask for mon—
ey from those organizations be-
cause they don’t have those funds,
she said. ,

' “We’re not  to make mon— '
ey off of them,” said Giangarlo.

SGB public relations chairman
Nikolai Condee—Padunov ‘said that
BAS and Pitt Band will not retain
their statues indeﬁnitely, but they
will go unchanged for at least one
more year. i - '

' Link and Ciangarlo said the

money organizations paid for their
statues will go back into the Stu-
dent Activities Fund.

Link said future boards may
choose to buy replacement pan-
thers, but the 2008 SGB chose not
to buy more this year, because last
year the statues were manufactured
too late for homecoming. They
were not unveiled until  _10 of
this year. I H

i The 2007 SGB was divided on
whether or not to buy the panthers.
At the end of the school year in
2007, the board had a budget sur-
plus. because organizations did not
use all the money they claimed in
their budgets. SGB and the tradi-
tions chair Amanda Satryan looked
into’ different projects on which to‘
spend the money. - -

Satryan came up with the pan-
ther project to replace the idea of a
homecoming parade, which would

Restaurant tour highlights Oakland's cuisine

by Nicole McIntyre
For (‘[25 Pitt ]Vew.I

For those who have trouble choosing
where to eat in Oakland, Tuesday night was a
good night.

Oakland restaurants welcomed new and
old Oakland residents to sample their fate for
its sixth annual restaurant tour.

Nine restaurants and about 200 guests
participated in b the event, organized by the
Oakland Planning and Development Corpo-

ration in conjunction with Pitt’s International

- Week, which began Monday.

 

  

Tickets for the event were $10 in advance
and $15 at the door. The tour allowed its par-
ticipants to move freely from one restaurant
to another as they wished.

“Each ticket indicated a starting place for
each participant, and we asked the guests to
follow the order on the back of their ticket
to avoid a rush of people at one restaurant,”
said Kelly \X/awrzeniak of the OPDC.

Pitt graduate Freda Ellis, who took part
in the event, said she enjoyed sampling the
cookies and fresh bread‘ from Panera Bread.
This was the first year she attended the tour.

“Some places give you a lot of things to

choose from, and others only have one small
serving,” said Ellis.

Qdoba’s marketing coordinator Richan
Gaskins said that participating in the tour was
an easy decision.

“I think joining the tour is great adver-
tisement for our business,” he said. “It also
gives members of the community [a chance]

to sample some of our food and enjoy -our ,

unusually large dining area.” This is Qdoba’s
third year in Oakland arid first year on the
tO1.1I'. ‘ ,

Qdoba served’ soft tacos along with its
signature salsa verde to those who passed

Red Oak Cafe is new to the tour this year,
as well as to the Oakland community, The
restaurant was founded in 2007.

Dave Gancy, a manager at the cafe, ex-
plained that the tour would help customers
not only to recognize where the business is,
but also will give customers a chance to sam-
ple some of its unique recipes and creations.

The cafe served frozen smoothies, oat-
meal smoothies and carrot soup, among oth-
er samples during the tour.

Pitt student Brock Sizer enjoyed the dish-
es that the restaurant offered, as well as the
idea of the tour.

Sizer said that the tour wasan easy way for
members of the community to try the food
from many restaurants without buying an en-
tire meal.

India Garden, which has participated in
the tour for four years, opened its entire buf-
fet to guests. »

Victor Barboza, manager of India Gar-
den, said that the tour has helped the business
to acquire some of its regular customers.

Dave & Andy’s owner Andy Hardie said
that his establishment has been in Oakland
for 25 years. '

Participating in the tour for his third year,
Hardie said that he likes to get involved and
support the Oakland community ir1 any way
that he can. _ H

“There are a lot of great restaurants in
Oakland,” said Hardie. “It is just very easyto
pass them without even knowing.”

Other restaurants which returned to the
tour this year included Lu Lu’s Noodles, Lee-
na’s, Chipotle and Rita’s Water Ice.

\Y/awrzeniak said that, in order to notify
local restaurants about the event, invitations
were sent out injuly to get an idea of which
local business owners would be interested in
participating.

While many of the restaurants in the tour

. have participated previously, the OPDC tries

to add at least one newcomer to the scene
each year.

Thank you Pitt News Readers!

apolitical ploy

The fundamentals of the

 economy may be strong, but
 apparently they’re not strong
: enough.

Sen. John - McCain

 announced yesterday that he
j would suspend his campaign for
' the week in order to return to

Washington and focus on ﬁnding

 a solution for the ﬁnancial crisis.
' McCain also suggested delaying
 Friday’s presidential debate to
; concentrate on the economy.

This is not the ﬁrst time

 McCain has made campaign
E changes to address other issues.

Earlier this month, the senator

1 suspended the first dayiof. the

Republican National Convention

j because of troubles caused by
i Hurricane Gustav in the Gulf.

. McCain said, according
to The New York ‘Times, “I
am calling on _the president to

. convene a meeting with the

 leadership from both houses of ‘

j Congress, including Sen. Barack
 Obama and myself. It is time for

both parties to come together to
solve this problem.” I

Obama, on the other hand,
did not see .the need to delay the
debate. According to the Times,
Obama said, “This is exactly the
timewhen peopleineed to heat

A from the candidates.” ,

The sense of urgency with,

which McCainis approaching this

issue is somewhat unfounded, V

especially because, for the most
part, the financial, problem
should be dealt with on a long-
term basis. i

"With a little more thanai
month left until Election Day,"

it is crucial that the candidates
keep the campaign momentum
going strong. Voter excitement

 is key in getting an overall high
. turnout on Nov. 4. A I

But McCain does not seem

, -to understand this. While he
, claims to be concerned about the
I state of the economy, we suspect’

that this is a political maneuver

to draw attention to McCain’s
‘legislative attributes, to help give
him a boost in the ratings and to
ultimately helplhim at the polls
on Election Day. "A
. Beyond the
smokescreen, this can only be an
effort by McCain to further his
image as a maverick, seemingly
acting as though his duty to

the U.S. economy is greater

than his bid for the presidency.
In suspending his" campaign,
McCain, who chaired the Senate
Commerce Committee from
2003 to 2005, is likely ’aiming
to. portray himself as the most
responsible candidate when it
comes to the economy.

political .

EDITORIAL    ~ ~ *  V ~

And it’s all very convenient . 

‘because’, for McCain, a suspended

campaign and‘ delayed debate
would ‘be a win—win situation.

It would not only allow him to ,

appear more concerned about the
economy than his ‘Democratic
counterpart, but it will also give
him more time to prepare before
facing Obama, whois inarguably
the better speaker,

Perhaps McCain is dreading
a replayof 19605 Kennedy—Nixon
presidential debates. This debate

not only displayed the dramatic‘

visual contrastbetween John F.

V Kennedy and "Richard Nixon, A
but also emphasized the level of

preparedness exhibited by each
candidate. In the end, Kennedy
was the obvious winner, and the
polls turned in his favor.

As a possible head - of
state, McCain’s suggestions are

I. worrisome. If McCain cannot
handle a few hours of debating , ‘

while dealing with a ﬁnancial
crisis, "how can Americans trust
him "to deal with the War on

,Terror, the economy, health

care and other problems that

f come with running the country? I

McCain should know that, as
president, he would .not always
have the luxury of putting his
plans on hold. I

Health insurance too ambiguous

     

by Levvis Lehe
Calummixt

Both candidates want to ex-
pand health insurance coverage.
But what is health‘ insurance? ,

We talk about "health insurance
like a commodity, like corn, that

' you have or don’t have. Health in-

surance is actually an idea, though
—— a guarantee that an insurance
provider will pay for certain medi-
cal treatments.

Of course, everyitime ‘health
insurance starts covering a new

treatment — a new therapy‘ for ,

throat cancer, for example —
we don’t give it a new name like
“health" insurance strikes back,”
or “health insurance: European
gigolo.’_’

7' So, it looks like the same prod-
uct is more expensive, even though
we’re actually  about a dif-
ferent, better product. _

A close analogy is English. We
say someone speaks English when

.. she knows a number of words

more than five, but she doesn’t

3 have to know every word in Web-_

ster’s.
Likewise, to. comfortably say
everyone is insured, we want them

,

covered for more than appendi-
citis, but not everything that can
be done for one’s health. We want
coverage only to an extent that’s

A ‘‘reasonable,’.’ with reasonable be-
_ing dependent on how we feel, not

some absolute standard.

Consider: In “Bowling for
Columbine,” Michael Moore asks
some Canadians about their free
health insurance.

They’re satisﬁed. But the mov-
ieiwas made in 2002, so they aren’t
covered for any of the treatments
invented after 2002. If the govern-
ment of Canada announced today
that it would only insure the treat-
ments covered in 2002, there’d be

. anuprising. Even though Canadi-

ans don’t recall 2002 as ‘a year of
deprivation, losing what they’ve
come to ‘expect would seem aw-

ful.

If our government is going to

help insure more people,'the am-
biguity of healthinsurance pres-
ents three problems: i ..
First, we have to be stricter
aboutwhich treatments are cov-

ered and subsidized. Through our j

government—run insurers Medic-

aid and Medicare, as. well as the

private insurers that our govern-
ment subsidizes via the tax code‘,

we’ve maintained an anything-
goes.attitude that fuels waste and
inﬂation. At present, the United

. States won’t even fund existing

commitments to Medicare, even
with higher taxes. if

Currently, demand for medical
treatments is divorced from the
gains and costs entailed: Covered
services are freeor the co-pay is

just a fraction of the cost, and

there’s no government rationing.
The long-term problem" with this
system is the direction innovation
takes.

If insurance pays for every new
treatment granting any beneﬁt,
regardless of cost, entrepreneurs
only proﬁt from inventing better
and costlier innovations. There’s
little incentive to ﬁnd a cheaper al-

ternative to an existing treatrnent,.

and no gain at allfor an alternative
that’s slightly ‘inferior but signiﬁ-

cantly cheaper.

I Second, the government should
be more open-minded about how
treatments are provided.

Even for what looks like a

-s

simple task —— a check—up, for’ex- :

ample — there are hundreds ‘of

circumstances to be ‘decided.

What tests does the doctor do? ‘

Dear Editor,

In response to Dan Gore’s letter to the
editor on the College Democrat’s expected’
Geraldine Ferraro _ev.ent, Gore is regretta-
bly misinformed on Ferraro’s position in
this election and the purposes behind our
inviting her to campus. ,

As demonstrated in a Sept. 10 interview
with Fox News, Ferraro makes it clear that
sheis a Democrat ﬁrst,.and she states di-

' rectly that she doesnot believe that Sen".

:9.-

Barack Obama is a sexist. The value of hav-
ing the ﬁrst minority on a presidential ticket’
speaking to Pitt students during this histor-

ic electioniis far more important than any

resentment harbgred by anyone from the

primary. For Gore to ignore Ferraro’s abil-

ity to mobilize students of all backgrounds

toward. the goals of our organization is

disappointing. His letter, which ‘viciously

brings back the. bitterness of the primary,

has done more to divide the party than any-
thing that could be said by Ferraro.

Dear Editor,

This letter is in response to the Sept. 22 interview with Mo
Rocca, “Rocca talks politics in Pitt Union.” Mo Rocca comment-
ed, “There are going to_ be a lot of people that lie, saying they’re
voting for the black guy and don’t.” His comment expresses an

. outdated view of society and pigeonholes the candidates and
voters as racially biased. To deﬁne Sen. Barack Qbama merely by
the color of his skin is an oversimpliﬁcation of a candidate who
not only revolutionizes the idea of the American dream but also
inspires hope in all Americans about the possibility of change
for the future of our country. Comments like Rocca’s highlight
the need of today’s media to catch up with the reality of Ameri-
can society. , "

This election will prove that a candidate -like Obama has the
ability to overcome stereotypes and unify across all demograph-
ics.iI believe Pitt students will beunfazed by these irrational

“comments and "come together to elect the candidate who best
represents them through his ‘policies- '
- Rocca’s focus on the"issue of race deﬂects attention from the

real issues that affect the United States, those of the economy,

the war in Iraq and the healthcare crisis. Regardless of how you
feel about the candidates this year, it is crucial that every student
be registered to vote by Oct. 6_and votes on Nov. 4.

The Pitt News has never been a conservative or unbiased newspaper,
but Matthew Diabes’ Sept. 24 column, “Church and state. should stay '>‘ --
separate,” crosses a line of decency. He distorts the idea of separation of
church and state and rnisrepresents Christianity, among other 

Concerning the separation of church and state, he claims that the idea
was established in order to protect the government from any religious in-
ﬂuence when, in fact, the main idea behind it was to protecufhe people
from a government that would _impose a speciﬁc brand of religion on
everyone. The separation of church and state actually protects the ‘right

of the people to practice their religion in the way they see ﬁt, and tl~.).t
includes voting their moral conscience as formed by religion. _

Iﬁnd it disturbing that Diabes claims that this very freedom to Vote 1
based on our conscience is .‘‘our country’s growing religion problem.”
I think that the bigger problem is that people like Matthew stereotype
Chiistians as warmongers andxfanatics in order to undermine our fun-
damental rights. Not all of us thought the Iraq war was just, and not all
of ‘us. blindly. support the Republican Party and many of its paradoxical
policypositions. The people of this country may use and misuse their

. religious views to determine the direction we are going in, but let us never
undermine the very fundamentals of America by claiming that they do I ’'

 Local band's latest is a knockout punch

Fans just  
 say yes to
  new disc

Most bands would cringe at
the thought of being categorized
as pop—punk, visions of shrieking
preteens and saccharine hooks
dancing through their heads.

But Punchline’s lead singer
and guitarist Steve Soboslai isn’t
phased.

“We’ve always been deﬁned as
a pop-punk band, whichil have
no problem with,” he said in an
interview with The Pitt News.

‘But when “Punchkids,” as the

band’s fans are lovingly known,‘
pick up Punchline’s just—released
fourth full—length album, ]u.rz‘ Say
Yes, they’ll see that the band has
diverged a bit from its pop-punk
roots. ‘

just Say Y}: is the ﬁrst _release
since Punchline, which is com-

» prised of Soboslai, bassist Chris

Fafalios, drummer  Caruso
and ‘second guitarist Jon Belan,
split from its record label, Fueled
by Ramen. It released just Say Yes
on its own record label, Modern
Short Stories, ﬁnanced partially
by $25,000 in prize money the
band won from a Heavy.com
contest. 5.

“It ran over four months. You
could upload as many videos as
you wanted, and whoever had the
most plays won,” said Soboslai.
The band was determined to win,
and by snagging 1.1 million views
it was victorious.‘

“I seriously think things would
be a lot different if we hadn’t won
that contest,” he said.

The band is also planning
to sign other artists to Modern

Short Stories and is very excited
to be announcing its ﬁrst signee

has served as his “secret inspira-
tion.”

is a big step forward, why would
a band leave its star—making la-

bel? After all, Fuelediby, Rameni

launched both Fall Out Boy and
Panic ‘at the Disco, among oth-
ers. S i .
“People ask us that and think
there’s a big story and animosity,

but our contract was just up. They
said if you guys want to keep do-
ing it, we’ll. keep doing it. It was
time for us to do something dif-

ferent. It just seemed like a good _

idea and feasible for us to release
it ourselves,” said Soboslai. ‘
More eclectic than Punchline’s

0 previous three albums, Soboslai

said ]u.rt Say Yes “branched out a
little bit” with “songs that have
more of a mood.” He said his'in-
spiration came from being home
after a 10-week tour, when the
band decided to take abreak just
to chill. -

.“I sat down and recorded a

bunch of songs that came out 

weird sounding.” said Soboslai.
He didn’t necessarily intend for

,.\__them to be Punchline songs, but

rather a creative outlet. As he puts
it, he was “just.writing’ songs to
write songs  just being creative
and really happy to be home.”
But when he brought them to
the rest of the band, they all liked

the new sound, which was “more
all over the place,” he said. With
help from producers Jamie Wool-
ford and Sean O’Keefe % who
have worked with bands such as
Hit the lights, The Format, Fall
Out Boy, Hawthorne Heights and
Plain White T’s —]u.rz‘ say Yes was
created; , _

The band, together since 1997,
has been very successful locally,
but when asked about its lack of
mainstream national success, So-
boslai is quick to respond. ‘

“People associate success with

being on MTV. That’s not the

 of success we want. ‘We
have really, really nice fans. On

‘MTV all your fans are little kids.

We want’ people to like our band
because the music is inspiring and

‘ we write smart songs, not because

our bass player is hot.”

, Expressing no regret, he adds,
“That’s ﬁne with me. l’m happy
with how things have gone.”

And ’ for good reason --

Punchline has sold more than
100,000 albums worldwide,
toured every major city in the
United States and played in six
foreign countries.

The band will play a CD re‘-

~ lease show at Diesel'Club Lounge

on Sept. 27 with local bands
Derek White  the Monopho-
bics, which Soboslai describes as
a “modern day Beach Boys,-” and
Your Life & Mine. The local mu-
sic scene has changed quite a bit
since Punchline’s conception.

“I ‘remember when We ﬁrst
started, Pittsburgh was known
as a street punk city with» Anti-
Flag and what they. had going
on. Pittsburgh is pretty indie rock
now,” said Soboslai. A

And after 10 years together,
what keeps Punchline going?

“Things always get better,”
said Soboslai. “People seem sur-
prised that we’re still around.
We’ve never had a reason to stop

.recording. It feels right.”

v If we’ve learned anything from

history, it’s that rock stars should

not pilot planes. 9 ,
Make huge audiences shimmy

_ and shake? Yeah, they can _do

that. Consume copius amounts of

, drugs and write weird freak-out '

jams? Yeah, that’s ﬁne too. But
they should not, under any cir-

S cumstances, pilot a plane. Ever.

V And the reason is simple: Rock
starsswho pilot their own planes,

‘ or even ride in their own planes

with hired pilots, tend to die.

This trend, which hadn’t been
revived in quite a few years, was
recently brought back from the
'dead last Friday, when a small
airplane, with passengers Tra-
vis Barker (formerly of b1ink—l82
and reality TV fame) and DJ AM
(ex—Nicole Richie ﬁance_and ex-
member of Crazy Town) skidded

off the runway and smashed into _'

light towers in Columbia, S.C.
The plane quickly caught ﬁre be-
fore anyone made it out, resulting
in the tragic deaths of Barker’s
assistant Chris Baker, his security
guard CharlesStill and the plane’s
two pilots, Sarah Lemmon and
James Bland. '

- The crash came only hours afé
ter Barker and DJ AM performed
a freeishow to 10,000—p1us fans.

Both musicians made it out
alive, with Barkerisustaining sec-

'ond— and .third+degree burns over

much of his lower body, and DJ
AM suffering facial burns.

As shocking as a tragedy of
this magnitude is, it’s far from
the ﬁrst time a rock-related plane
crash has takenvlives. A

Airing second after “The Simpsons,” “King

running animated series. The show revolves
around Hank Hill andhis family —— wife Peg-

. gy, son Bobby and Peggy’s niece Luanne, who

was taken in by the Hills—afte_r*Luanne’s mother
stabbed Luanne’s father with a fork and was
sent to prison. Hank is a proud Texan who
sells propane and propane accessories, and de-

spite his perceived narrow-minded, conserva-.

tive nature, he is portrayed as a good man who

will always help out his friends, regardless of S

how idiotic they might be.
Many other animated shows rely on over-
the—top, out-of—this—world humor, but “King

of the Hill” is kept on a realistic playing ﬁeld e

throughout the series,  wit in more

somber, possibly even mundane scenarios.

_With two Emmy awards underits belt and

seven more nominations, “King of the Hill”
premieres its 12th season this Sunday. In the
episode, Hank’s obese friend Dale develops
diabetes and is conﬁned to a wheelchair. He
wallows in depression until he meets Thun-

wheelchair rugby, or “murder ball,” andshows
Dale a new way to live.

was canceled in 2000. But when DVD sales of
“Family Guy” sold 2.2 million copies in a year,
network executives’ interests were piqued. The
show returned brieﬂy, but again, characters
such as Joe Swanson, a handicapped police
officer who was a constant reminder of the
show’s insensitivity, causedsit to be canceled

reason, and Pitt’s unit has lived up

The special teams, led by punt-

toward the end of Pitt’s 21-20 tri-
umph over Iowa on Saturday.

Brytus was plenty busy in the
ﬁnal three quarters of action,

West Virginia, ”i,;iRutge,rs
look to rebound Saturday

Big East, page 18

State at home. Senior quarterback Hunter
Cantwell, whose 629 passing yards are
good for fourth in the Big East, will power
the Cardinals offense. , "

Morgan State at Rutgers

The Morgan State Bears (2-1) head to
Newjersey on Saturday to take on Big East
opponent Rutgers (0-3). The Bears, who
hail from the Mid—Eastern Athletic Con-
ference, will play their first and only game
against a Big East opponent.

After losing their ﬁrst game of the
season, the Bears have responded with
back—to-back wins against non-conference
teams. Junior quarterback Carlton jackson
and sophomore running back Devon James
lead the team offensively.

For the Scarlet Knights, victory has not
found the team this year. Still, senior quar-
terback Mike Teel is second in the Big East
in passing yards. Following its game against
the Bears, Rutgers will head to Mountain-
eer Field to take on West Virginia in its first
Big East match of the season; ‘

I

Marshall at West Virginia

The Thundering Herd of Marshall (3-1),
the current Conference-USA East division
leaders, visit Morgantown, WVa., this Sat-
urday to take on, the Mountaineers (1 -2) in
their annual game. West Virginia traveled to
Marshall last September for the first time in
92 years and defeated its in-state rival after

_ a slow start.

For Marshall, the team has started hot,
having only lost its second game to Wis-
consin. Aside froin the loss, the Thunder-
ing Herd have had success in inter-confer-
ence play (2-0). Sophomore running back
Darius Marshall is second in the Confer-
ence USA with 417 yards.

West Virginia started the season ranked

I eighth nationally before "upsets against

Eastern Carolina and Colorado. Now, se-
nior quarterback Pat White and the rest of
the Mountaineer team will look to turn the
season around.

Cincinnati at Akron

I The Akron Zips (2-2) play host to the
Cincinnati Bearcats (2-1) this Saturday af-
ternoon.

Having already beaten one Big East
team this season (Syracuse), the Zips will
look to go two for two after‘ playing the
Bearcats. Akron’s wide receiving duo of

' junior Deryn Bowser’and senior Andre

Jones will look to power the Zips’ offense
as it feeds off the momentum from beating
Army last week.

After beating rival  (Ohio) last

week, ‘junior quarterback Tony Pike hopes >_

to lead his team to another victory. After

senior Dustin Grutza brokehis leg in the '
Bearcats’ loss at Oklahoma, Pike won his

only start this season. Cincinnati vsﬁll face

Marshall ‘next Friday in a nationally tele-
_ vised game. ' '

~ South Florida at North Carolina State

The Big East’s only ranked team, No. 13
South Florida (4-0), will journey to Raleigh,
N.C., this Saturday to ‘take on ACC oppo-
nent North Carolina State (2-2).

The Wolfpack enter the game on a high
after upsetting then No. 15 East Carolina

. in overtime. They havewon both home

games this seas.on.>This will be N.C. State’s

only game against the Big East this season. 
Quarterback Matt Grothe, the Bulls’ =

redshirt junior, leads the Big East in ‘pass-

ing yards and will carry the offense as 1
_ South Florida hopes to -improve to 5-0 for A
the second consecutive season. The Bulls 

will have a short week following the Wolf-

. pack game as they host Pitt in-a primetime 3
