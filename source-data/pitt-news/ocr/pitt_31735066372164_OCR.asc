FORT INDIANTOWN GAP,
PA. AP L The Army National
Guard will help students repay
their college loans if they enlist
forthree to six yearsintheguard.

Maj_or General Richard Scott
says students who qualify for
loan repayments also may be
eligible for a National Guard
enlistment bonus and educa-
tional aid.

V Under the program, the Army
National Guard will pay l5 per-
cent of the student’s loan balance
or $500, whichever is greater,
plus interest.

Loans that qualify are guaran-
teed direct student loans made
after Oct. l, i975. ’

Geography Talks

A special ad hoc committee is
being formed by the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council to
comment on a proposal to elimi-
nate the geography department
by August 1983.

So far Fred Kaufman of the
chemistry department, Richard
Cottam of the political science
department and a graduate stu-
dent have been appointgd by
FASC to serve on the committee.

When Jerome Rosenberg,
dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, proposed to eliminate
the geography department, he
also proposed to seek comments
from FASC committees and the
geography department itself.

Elimination of the geography
department was first proposed
last spring as part of a plan to
adopt a reduced budget for FAS.

Jack Freeman, Pitt‘s senior vice
chancellor ‘for administration, is
rarely at a loss for the provocative
quote or newsworthy statement, the
kind journalists like to print.

But when discussing the planning
process for Pitt’s fiscal year 1983
budget, Freeman finds it hard to
avoid saying the same thing he did
last year about the current budget
and the budget before that.

And so it is not surprising that
after doing his best to explain the
key issues that go into determining
Pitt’s multi-million dollar budget, he
lets out an exasperated sigh when
asked to state what the specifics are
going into the fiscal year I983
budget.

“I just told you, ” he said, using
the tone of voice an impatient
teacher might use when talking to an
inattentive student. “There’s
nothing magic about this thing. I
mean it isn’t mysterious at all."

The best way to describe the plan-
ning going into the university’s

some mathematical terms: the con"-
stants remain fixed while the varia-
bles change under different
conditions.

The constants, according to Free-
man’s explanation, are primarily
concerned with the spending side,of
the budget. ‘

The mandated increases in expen-
ditures, for example. What does Pitt
have to spend in order to meet com-

previous sources of funding, such as
federally supported research‘? Or
operational costs, such as utility rate
increases and salary commitments
to Pitt’s unionized workers‘?

And along those same lines, there

By CHRIS CLINTON

Assistant News Editor

At selected times during the
school year, a group of Pitt students
shed their tennis shoes, blue jeans
and T-shirts and don suits, ties and
dresses to enter the complicated
world of state politics.

‘These students are members of the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, a standing committee of SGB,
and are the lobbying group for Pitt’s
student body. The committee is
scheduled to make‘l0 trips to Har-
risburg this year to lobby for
increased aid at Pitt. P

Chip Roth, committee chairman,
expects a tough battle with the legis-
lature this term because of President
Reagan's budget cuts.

“We’re in an era of fiscal conser-
vatism so.it’s going to be hard to get
the kind of money we’d like to get,"
Roth said.

Jamie Gilkey, committee member
and parliamentarian, said he expects
Pitt to get a 5 or 6 percent increase in
its operating budget this year, but_he
admits it will be tough.

Roth said the greatest area ofcon-
cern for GRC is Reagan's proposed’
block grants for states and the feder-
ally legislated tuition tax cuts, cur-
rently being debated in US. Senate

salary issues, Freeman said, are also

be figured into the budget.

Then there is the other side ofthe
fiscal year I983 budget. the side
which determines how the whole
thing will be funded. While the sour-

how much Pitt can expect from the
state. However, Freeman cautioned,
what fails to come from the state will
have to be made up by the students.

Translated into more graphic
terms, if the state doesn’t come
through, then tuition hikes are inev-
itable. "

“If the state gives us more money,
then we can hold tuition down. lfthe

hts Cuts

Washington this year to meet with
various congressmen from Pennsyl-
vania to discuss tuition hikes and
financial aid.

Roth said the effects ofthe budget
cuts will be evident in the next state
budget, and the committee is prepar-i
ing itself for the war against the cuts.

“Right now we‘re in thestage of
gathering information," Roth
said.“We have the opportunity to
serve as an information giver, so we
have to do our research.”

The committee members meet on
a one-to-one basis with representa-
tives from Allegheney County. Dur-
ing one trip, he said, the committee
tries to see everyone from the
county. Then they focus their atten-
tion on committee chairmen and the
education and appropriation com-
mittee members. ,

Roth said he thinksthe committee
is a vital part "of the university
because somebody has to remind
state _legislators of their
responsibilities.

"lt’s their (legislators) responsibil-
ity to fund higher education,” Roth
said. “And it‘s a responsibility
they’re not meeting."

in addition to the appropriations
question, the committee is also inter-
ested in tenant-landlord relation-
ships and have done some lobbying
in the past for the decriminalization
of marijuana and the lowering ofthe

SGB Plans Meeting

The Student Government Board will hold the first of it s planning

‘ sessions this week, the date to be later announced. SGB President Bill

Abraham said that the reason for the delay is due to the difﬁc/ulty of
finding a time for the board members to meet.

“Some of our nine members are still add / dropping," Abraham said,
“but we will definitely have one and advertise it widely.”

The first meeting’s agenda Vvill include a few business items and a
basic recap of what SGB has been doing. The ‘remainder of the
planning session will consist‘ of student input. I

“This year we have no active projects to start into,” Abraham said.
“Instead, we want to hear the students’ suggestions and set goals for’

Black Hole Saga

BY MARY KANE

Etlilor

Ezra Newman would never ask
you what your sign is. He doesn‘t
talk to his plants to make them
grow. And even ifyou call him at the
exact moment he’s thinking of call-
ing you, he'll never credit the coinci-
dence to ESP.

However. since you’re likely to
find a lot of Pitt students doingthese
very things, Newman, a Pitt physics
professorfstarted a course six years
ago to let them know the facts about
the “pseudosciences."

“l was teaching a pre-med physic
class. and I asked how many ofthem
believed in ESP,” Newman said. “l
was appalled that so many of our

future doctors believed in such
nonsense."
Thus, the course Science and

Pseudoscience was born. lt’s techni-
cally a physics class, one of several
undergraduate and graduate courses
in physics and astronomy that New-
man teaches.

The course deals with pseudosci—
ences such as pyramid power, (very
popular awhile back) and Kyrlian
photography (the photographing of
human auras, which is actually an
easily explained scientific pheno-
menon). Also discussed in the class
are purported psychics, including
Israeli Uri Geller whose spoon— and‘
key-bending tricks,‘ it has been:
found, were taught to him by Israeli’
schoolchildren.

ces‘? One is thought photography,

his thoughts with a Polaroid One-

misinformation.

(thought by some to be effective in
treating cancer) or certain dietary
fads.

Or, in Newman’s case, black holes
and Walt Disney.

Black holes are not a dangerous
pseudoscience; they are astronomi-
cal objects that have such a strong
pull of gravity that they suck in ev-
erything around them, including
light.

They are also part of Albert Ein-
stein’s theory of relativity, which is
Newman‘s area of research and
study. And, although you can’t
really see a black hole, you might be
able to tell where one is by lookingat
its effects on the surrounding stars.

In fact, Newman and an associate

ney “expert" sent to lecture on col-
lege campuses about them.

The poor guy surely didn‘t realize
what he was up against when he
came to Pitt. Newman endured most
of the “expert's" basically inaccurate
lecture before finallyjumping to his
feet to correct the guy.

“I lost my temper," Newman said.
But he gained some publicityvlocal
radio and television stations
requested interviews after hearing of
the incident.

The media may have been a little
surprised when it first encountered
Newman. He’s a striking contrast to
the physics professor sterotype: no
frazzled grey hair. long white lab
coat, or bifocals like grandfather
used to wear. Rumor has it that he
even jogs to work.

Newman is a New York City
native who came to Pitt in l956 after
undergraduate studies at New York
University and graduate studies at
Syracuse.

ln Newman‘s career here, he and a
group of other Pitt professors have
been continually researching radia-
tion problems and the theory ofgen—
eral relativity.

He‘s also fought with the Pitt
bookstore when it sold pyramids
and books on astrology and inciting
emotions in your plants. Those
things still bother him, but lately he
said he has become more tolerant.

Perhaps it has something to do
with an incident that happened at
the end of one of his classes. A stu-
dent told him that he accepted New-
man‘s arguments against the
existence of U FO’s intellectually,
but emotionally he still believed they
existed.

“And you can’t change a person's
emotions,” Newman said. “I won't
even try to do that.”

Doctor Discredits Medical Value of Laetrile 

By MIKE MALLINGER

Pitt News Staff Writer

A cancer researcher formerly
employed by Pitt has stated that lae-
trile, a cancer treatment, has no
medical value whatsoever.

Speaking from the Roswell Park
Cancer Institute in New York, Dr.
Garth Anderson said simply, “It
doesn’t work.”

Laetrile, a derivative of apricot

mechanisms
exists.”

He defined cancer as “the prolifer-
atilpg enemy. a mass of uncontrolled
ce s."

by which cancer

Researchers think that a single
normal cellular gene “gets turned on
permanently," transforming that
normal cell into a cancer cell like a
row of dominoes, the same gene in
other cells becomes “converted”
down the line.



pits, is outlawed in the United States . . fa
as a Cancer treatment, although “lt‘sl1ke.turn.1ng off all the power 
to the University of P1ttsburgh— it,

some terminal patients hav_e turned
to laetrile as a last resort.

“If you’re dying, you have every
right to be upset at the prospect and
to grasp for something. I think that’s
what‘s behind laetrile,” Anderson
said.

,“Laetrile offers something," he
said, citing a historical parallel—
horse serum—-that had no effect on
cancer when doctors used it I5 years
ago.

Medical science today offers
brighter prospects—40 percent cure
rate for cancer patients, which “is
not bad,” he added, when compared
to a hopeless situation 50 years ago.

Anderson’s actual research cen-
ters on factors that transform a nor-
mal cell into a cancer cell.

He thinks that the answer to the
cancer riddle lies in genes, and he is
trying to pinpoint exactly which
genes are “converted.”

“The problem is,” he said, “what is
at the top ofthe pyramid referring to
what goes awry in a normal cell and
the sequence in which it happens.”

everything shuts down if you can
find the master switch at the top,"he
said.

So far Anderson had found one
gene and its gene product and
researchers are attempting to design
agents to shut off the activity of the
gene or its gene product. The cancer
cell would then be converted back to
a normal cell, he added.

Environmental carcinogens or
radiation may trigger gene
transformation.

Retro~viruses, ordinarily harm-
less viruses found in normal cells,
may be picked up by a specific cellu-
lar gene after exposure to carcino-
gens or radiation and may be
incorporated into the viruses’
genetic information. A cancer cell is
then created.

“What the virus has done is iden-
tify the key ca ncer causing gene,” he
said. I

Interferon, hailed by some as a
control for cancer a few years ago,
now appears to have a limited effect

Medical science offers brighter prospects for cancer patients — a forty percent cure rate.

A professor of Reaganomics
might lecture on the following equa-
tions: budget cuts. plus tax cuts. plus
tight moneyrat the federal reserve.
plus time and patience. plus more
budget cuts equals lowering of
inflation.

But a prospective small biisiness-
person in the class may shake this
head and wonder how he‘ll stirxive
in an environment of soaring inter-
est rates and tax breaks favoring the
big corporations.

These questions will be examined
in a series of seminars on marketing
management sponstired by the
Small Business Development Center
of Pitt‘s Graduate School of Busi-

“The focus is on marketing in the
current environment of high infla-
tion. high unemplo_vment and high
interest rates.“ according to Clar-
ence Ctii‘r_v. director of the center.
" This is a series of seminars aimed at
reaching a population not geared to
traditional business. who are not
attracted to~normall_\ applied prac-
tice. This can be applied to their
resource base." he said.

The Small Business Development
Center is part ofa statewide network
of centers designed to provide com-

ness, beginning Sept. 15 and lasting prehensive counseling services,
12 weeks. training and technical assistance for
The seminars are part of the Stu— small businesses. ‘

The center is a focal point in link-
ing resources on the federal, state

dent Consultant Project which aims .
at assistance in mamagement for the

and local government levels with

resources of the school of business
and the private sector. in hopes of
expanding small business opportu-
nities for established as well as be-
ginning entrepeneurs. The center is
also a research base. 8

“Part of the course is devoted to‘
developing an
bu_ver behavior. to have a feeling for

ces. It‘s a matter of passing the cost

('urr_v emphasi/ed that “we're not
selling an economic philosophy.
We're helping people understand the
environment. We‘re explaining Rea-
gan’s policy and how it’s likely to
affect their business."

Curry declined to comment on the

impact he thinks the Reagan pro— _

gram has had on the small business
community.

seminars. call Ms. Ann Robinson at
624-6435.

Freeman said.

While a decision on exactly how
much tuition will have to be raised
won‘t be made until sometime this
summer, when the university knows
approximately how much revenues
it can expect. tuition will probably
be raised.

‘ Money Talks

Certain subjects should never be discussed at
dinner, your parents probably told you when you
vividly described a dead frog while the members
of your family dropped their forks and ignored
the chicken and peas on their plates. Such com-
mon sense should not be ‘limited to mealtimes.
Certain subjects just don’t deserve to be
discussed.

In the case of Pitt’s budget process, just the
opposite is true. It’s a subject that has to be
discussed virtually all the time, for the process
itself is a never-ending task. In the fall of 198 l—
now-—talk of next year’s budget begins, giving
students and their wallets barely enough time to
recover from the shock of the previous year’s
tuition increase. They pay their bill, miserably
calculating how much more it will cost them the
next time around.

A decision on-the exact amount of next year’s
inevitable tuition hike won’t bemade until a Pitt
Board of Trustees meeting sometime next
summer. But putting together the budget, calcu-
lating how‘much expenditures will increase and
state support will decrease, requires much more
than simply waiting.

That’s why Senior Vice Chancellor for Admin-
istration Jack Freeman, who has been through
the complicated process before, explained that
‘preparing this year’s request for state appropria-

' tions won’t be that much different from preparing

the previous year’s. The increases are calculated,
then Pitt will look to the state in hopes of receiv-
ing more financial support" to avoid another
increase. 

In the meantime, there is little else to do—
except prepare. On the part of the administra-
tion, this means developing strategies to acquire
increased state support and looking within to cut‘
costs. For students, it means a trip to Harrisburg.

Members of Pitt’s Governmental Relations
Committee will shed their tennis shoes and jeans
for suits and rented cars this fall and head to
Harrisburg to plead Pittfs case,’personally,'to
legislators.

“And so that’s the situation, and every year you
face exactly the same set of problems,” Freeman
said.

How_ the process of? preparing this year’s
budget process will turn out is anyone’s guess.
Freeman said there are variables—the economy
and inﬂation——that could sway the final figures.
Perhaps we could hope for a situation that would
keep us on the edge of our seats——remember the
Liquor Control Board bottle tax of last year?

lt’s best to prepare for the entire process by
considering it a rite of autumn, as much as foot-
ball games and frat parties:

Floating Half-truths, Rumors

By TIM KEARNEY

There are a lot of half-truths float-
ing aro_und. The Afghani rebels are
not led by a US—Chinese-Egyptian
contingent, as Russia claims.
Poland’s Solidarity union is not
CIA-inspired. Salvadorans are not
influenced by Cuba. Western Euro-
peans are not pacificists. “better red
than dead." v

Propaganda abounds these days.
Are we really friendly with the
Republic of South Africa because
they have stood with us in the world
wars? If this ancient history istour
test, then why in the name ofjustice

. are we allies with Japan or the Fed-

eral Republic of Germany‘? Its been
over a year since the Poles started to
strike. Where are the often predicted
Soviet tanks? Why have they been
silent‘?

Perhaps the world can‘t be seen in
solely East—West terms.‘ lt’s very
doubtful that the Salvadorans need
Cuban prodding to push them to
revolt. The actions of right—wing
death squadsfare enough, let alone
the poverty of that tiny nation.

ls it true that Britain’s economic
problemscan be placed at the feet of

the Labor Party’s policies'?'Or is Bri-
tain’s problem that less than four
decades ago it owned one-quarter of
the colonial territories and now has
little land outside its North Atlantic
island? Is our economy really
strapped by big goverment, or do we
have the freest economy in the
industrialized world? Does Presi-
dent Reagan work three hours aday
or l0? After his successes, does it
matter‘? . .

“Perhaps the meaning 0f
alienation...is a man ’s inabil-
ity to discern what's true.

if the organized labor movement
really believes that the Poles are
doing the right thing, it seems odd
that the unions haven’t hired more
organizers. The Poles have union-P
ized an entire nation, while the
American unions can’t organize one
industry.

If big government and its spend-
ing are inflationary, why are we
expanding our military to such an
extent? Isn‘t that government spend-
ing?A How can we accuse the Western

sister
inability todiscern what’s true. Per-

Europeans of being gun-shy when

the neutron bomb will be deployed
exclusively in Central‘Europe‘? Do
those nations have no say in their
futures or in the use of their coun-
tries? Everything therefore. is left to
interpretation. How can we decide
what‘s right, what's true? Perhaps

the meaning of alienation, and its
traveler apathy, is man’s

haps we can’t process all the infor-
mation our world throws to us.
Perhaps this is whywe look for the

easy slogans which can really give us

so much comfort‘.

Trouble in the third world? We
automatically suspect Soviet (or
Cuban, ‘Nicaraguan or any other)
meddling.

Economic problems? Big govern-
ment has to be the culprit, we think.

Maybe the world really is too
large to be understood. Maybe we’re
too small to make much difference.
But it‘s a shame to let it go by with-
out at least looking at it, wondering
how it works, and determining how
we fit into it. We’re humans, for
God’s sake, not ants.

tional studies.)

‘Letters  

Pitt Lacking Child Care Center

Dear Editor:

This letter is to inquire about the
lack of facilities for child care in the
entire University of Pittsburgh. It
seems ironic that the Women’s Cen-
ter. which is dedicated to the needs
of women, should ignore such an
obvious need.

I am presently enrolled in the
External Studies program. With
three children under the age of six. l
must plan my days around their
activities and needs. Coordinating
school and child care is very difficult
without any drop-in child care at
Pitt. ‘

For example.duringthe summerl
had to take a test in Oakland. A
typical ride of 30 minutes on the
Parkway West. took an hour and l5
minutes due to construction. Since
there are no facilities at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh for child care. I
had to pay $l2 for my children to be
at a child care center forthree hours.

This amount of money certainly g

adds up, if figured per exam. Had
there been a drop-in child-care cen-
ter at the university, l would have
used it for the exam (which took me
30 minutes to complete). As it was, I
paid the child-care center for the 2'/3
hours of driving time.

I chose to attend the University of
Pittsburgh because of its reputation

of high academic standards, but the v

lack ofchild care is affecting my pro-
gress and involvement in the pro-
grams offered. lf there was a regular
center available, I would probably
be out at the university more often to
study‘or become involved in other
programs.

I receive the newsletter from the
Women‘s Center arLd must compli-
ment them on its informative con-
tents. However. why do they avoid
such an obvious need of many
women? Several friends and neigh-
bors cite the expense of child care as
the most deterring factor to return-
ing to school.  ’

A child-cares center could accom-~

modate a large populationof peo-
ple. A facility run by or with the

‘University of Pittsburgh, could) be

used as a teaching aide for students
of nursing, early childhood educa-.
tion and psychology. Oakland is
such an active center of medicine
and education for Pittsburgh, it
seems absurd that such a needed
facility is not available. Even the vis-
itors and families of patients at the
various hospitals would be able to
use the center to drop off children
(usually not allowed in hospitals)
while they are visiting or having out-
patient treatments.

Has there been any study done
concerning the possibility ofa child-
care center? If so. I would be inter-
ested in the results. The University



1

of Pittsburgh offers so many pro-  

grams to its students. why not the
use of a drop-in day-care child cen-
ter‘?

Frat Rush ’70—Fond Memories and Wise

By LARRY LUNSFORD

Me/ri(irie.s' mat‘ be beautiful and
_l‘('I...

For the past If) da_vs or so. frater-
nity and sorority rush has been
going on at Pitt. That's the period
when the fraternity and sorority
members hold functions to attempt
to attract new members to their
ranks. Darticularl_v freshmen. All the
signs. newspaper
and parties remind me of a week
almost ll years ago when I exper-
ienced my first fraternity rush.

The odd thing about the whole
ordeal wasithat I didn‘t even know
what a fraternity was. No one from
my family had ever been in a frater-
nity or-sorority: I hadn’t had the
opportunity to become familiar with
the organizations.

_,In the summer following my high
school graduation, I started receiv-
ing dozens of letters from groups
with unusual names. introducing
themselves-land inviting me to var-
.I(,u:s niiietions at their houses on the
University of Tennessee campus
where I was to attend that fall. All
the mail I received from just about
everyone connected with the
sehool—— fraternities, religious
groups. and elubs—~ was friendlyand
made me anxious to start college.

I had no idea what to expect upon
my first visit to a fraternity house. I
knew the groups were famous for
their partying. but I wasn‘t aware yet
of their other activities. I was
impressed with the newly-
constructed “mansions" in which
they were housed. Judging from the
many testimonials in each group‘s
brochure, they seemed to receive
good administrative support.

At every house I visited. beautiful
women greeted me as I entered. The

members wore coats and ‘ties. and a
young lady introduced to "me as a
little sister‘. pinned a name tag on my
shirt. I w'as called a rushee. and my
name and hometown were written
with a different color ink than were
those of the brothers and the
pledges. I still didn‘t know the differ-
enee between a brother and a pledge.
But I could tell everyone apart by the
color of the ink on his name tag.

chance to meet a lot of people who
seemed to be interested in me and

my future. Undoubtedly there were

some w ho didn't care the least about
me. but at the time I didn‘t reali/e it.
I enjoyed the parties. and frankly. I
enjoyed the attention.

. Even though I didn‘t know much
about fraternities. I knew even dur-
ing that summer rush and before I
got to campus. that I wanted to be a

join. that the two brothers gave me.
I hey asked me if I accepted it. and I
said _ves.'I thought I was accepting
the physical bid not the invitation.
Oh well. the rest is history. They
shook in_v hand and escorted me‘ out
to make the announcement to the

Believe it or not. the first thing

that happened was not that I was

handed a beer. I never was given any
alcoholic beverages at the houses
during rush: none was allowed. In
fact. this rule worked because each
night. members of the administra-
tion. including the university presi-
dent. would visit the fraternity
houses to show their support for the
system. They would spend time talk-
ing to the members and their guests

.and then move to the next house.

Only once during rush week was
alcohol allowed, and that function
had to be held mid-week at an off-
campus site. ' '

I found rush to be fun. I was a
freshman away from home for the
first time in my life. and I had the

 

part of the Greek system. There were
25 houses to rush. so there was a
problem in deciding where to
pledge. (Naturally I didn‘t yet realize
that I had to be asked to pledge.)
Considering that rush lasted but five
or six days, I didn‘t really have that
much time to make a decision.
The odd thing about the whole

if affair was that I actually pledged_the

house where I wanted to pledge by
accident. Still naive to the nature
and particularly the language of the
(ireeks, I was taken to a room by a
couple of the brothers and given

Lions Drop

, Pitt in Final

 

By JODY GIDLEY

Pitt News Sportswriter

The Pitt Lady Panther volleyball
team took second place in the 10-
team Pitt Invitational Tournament
held this weekend.

The finals of the tournament
turned out to be a rematch of Friday
night‘s Pitt-Penn State clash. Again,
the Lady Lions emerged victorious,
winning the match l5— 5,15-l6.

“Our goal was to win the tourna-
ment,” said Pitt Coach Shelton Col-
lier. “However, finishing second
isn't a total disappointment."

En route to the finals, Pitt
defeated Loyola of Chicago in the
quarterfinals and Northern Ken-
tucky University in the semifinals.
Penn State defeated Edinboro State
College and Ohio State University
respectively to earn their berth in the
ﬁnals. _

After defeating NKU, Pitt went
directly into the final match with
Penn State without a rest, while
Penn State hada short break after
downing Ohio Staté.“The team was
tired upon entering the Penn State
match," said Collier.“However,
Penn State was totally dominant in
play.”

In Saturday's action, Pittdefeated
last year‘s Invitational champ
Rutgers, which proved to be an

Pitt JO|tS Grove City

By MIKE ROSE

Pm News Sportswriter

Senior Al Adelmann scored two
goals, includingthe game winner, to
lead the Pitt Panthers to a 3-l vic-
tory Friday over a tough Grove City
team. »

Adelmann scored his second goal
of the game on a penalty kick with
20:15 left in the first half. That was
all the Panthers needed as their
defense rose to the occasion in the
second half to smother l0th-ranked
Grove City’s offense.

The game was really closer than
the score indicated. Grove City
failed to capitalize on some golden
scoring opportunities.

TheiPanthers outshot Grove City
l5—l l. ‘”i

Pitt opened the scoring l2:l5 into
the first half on Adelmann’s first
goal of the game. Karl Heimbach
picked up the assist. The goal
seemed to give the Panther offense
some momentum because they came
up with a few more goodiscoring
opportunities in the first half.

Adelmann‘s second goal gave the
Panthers a 2-0 lead going into
halftime.

Grove City finally got on the
scoreboard with only 4250 gone in
the second half on a goal by Paul
Sauer off avwell—executed indirect
kick. The quick goal brought the
Grove City offense alive early in the

 

. second half, but the Panther defense

refused \to give up any more high»
percentageshots.

The Panthers finally got the insur-
ance goal they needed from JUDIOT
Eric Tiedtke with 7:45 left in the
game. John Hagenbuch picked up
the assist.

Grove City’s Tony Caruso game
the Panthers one last scare by hitting
the goalpost with 2:46 left in the
game.

Pitt Coach Leo Bemis said his
team is beginning to show some
spark in the offense, a trouble spot
for the Panthers late last season.
“We had good ball control tonight."
said Bemis. Hethought the Panthers
had controlled the ball especially
well in the first half of the game.

PANTHER NOTES: Freshman
Shurlund Lucke left the game in the
first half after he received a blow to
head. He is the not seriously hurt
and will be ready to play in the next
game against St. Vincent College...
Adelmann and Tiedtke lead the
Panthers in scoring with three goals
each after two games...The Pan-
thers’ next game will be at St. Vin-
cent Sept. lb. St. Vincent will be led
by Greg Aines...The Panthers‘.next
home game will be Sept. l8 against
Slippery Rock.

Penn State Lady Lions roared
into Fitzgerald Field House Friday
night and took the bite out of the
Lady Panthers l6~—l4, l5———6. l5A~—2
to win an important Eastern
women‘s volleyball contest.

“l was disappointedf’.-_said Shel-
ton Collier, the Lady Panther coach.
“We thought we were prepared. We
weren’t aggressive and our serving
was tentative, which allowed Penn
State to run an effective offense.
Overall, we were just totally
outplayed."

Collier commended the play of
the Lady Lions. the defending East-
ern champs.

“They were excellent,” Collier
sa‘id. “Volleyball is a sport that is
played on momentum, and they
didn’t allow us to gain any. We also
were unable to stop middleblocker
Ellen Crandell. She is a super player.
If you don’t stop her, then you can‘t
beat Penn» State. Penn State is one of
the top five teams that we will play.”

As for Pitt, Coach Collier was
very pleased with the individual play
of Paula Olsen. who was consistent
throughout the match.

“She is outstanding,”Colliercom-
mented, She has to be one of the

.most effective and consistent spikers

l have ever coached. However, vol-

“it‘s more a controlled game.
They concentrate more on work-
ing the ball and passing. Here.
for the most part. it’s more of a
kick-and-run game. At Pitt we’re

trying to use the German style of
control.”

Last year Wilson got a lot of
playing time in the midfield and
helped out the Panther scoring
attack by putting two goals in the
net.

In this year’s young season,
Wilson has been more concerned
with defensive play.

As a midfielder, Wilson must.
be able to get the ball under con-
trol in a hurry in order to move it
down the field. Wilson’s job is
more defensive than offensive,
which is a switch for him. In high
school he played at the wing
position. which is where most of
the scoring comes from.

“l‘m not accustomed to play-
ing defense,"said Wilson. “Being
up front and scoring is more
attractive, but L-have a responsi-
bility to the defense.“

H olts: A Semi-pro Game
But Approach is Wholehearted

By scor STONI:

J.-.«~. F.f?oi

By 8 o‘clock. (100 fans had taken
their placesin the stands oralongthe
goal—lines. The glow of the arc-
lamps mixed with the mist that rose
off the field to make the place look

like a killing ground for some
vicious Hollywood swamp beast.
There were shouts and rounds of

hand slapping and congratulations
among the players on each bench.

When the game announccr‘s \‘()!CC
had died away following the reading
of the team rosters, silence settled
oyer Carnegie High School's
Wagner Memorial Field. The Erie
Express was ready now to kick offto
the Pittsburgh Colts and begin the
semifinal round of the semi-pro
football leagues Mid—Atlantic Con-
ference Championship playoffs.

Within three minutes. Pitts-
burgh’s Dave Timpson pulled down
a 30-yard pass from Jeff Beer and
slogged his way across the goal—line
to put the first points on the board
for the Colts. A successful extra
point. an Erie turnover and two min-
utes later. Gary Bonds added
another six for the Colts with a 9-
yard run into the end zone.

  

there is a general meeting
for all students interested
in joining WPGH radio in
Dining Rooms ABC of the
Student Union at 6:00
PM. That’s today!!!

A brief description ofthe
station and this year’s
plans and an outline of
positions available at the
station are on the agenda.

lt ws not until the second quarter
that the Express was able to crack
the Pittsburgh defense and avoid a
complete shutout. The final score:
56-2!. with the Colts on top.

There is something almost sur-
realistic about the atmosphere that
surroundsithis sort of a game. The
players driye and hit like their lives
depend on it. and the fans cheer
enthusiastically.

At the same time. a carniyal feel-
ing lingers in the air. The players are
mostlly hometown boys. a few with
a possible shot at a pro career but
most just out to play the game and
have a good time.

Colt running back and co—owner
Eddie Brosky said that when he
started the team there was the idea
that he might still have a chance to
get into the pros. but lately he has
kept in it for the fun.

“For me the only game is foot-
ball.“ Brosky said. “I would feel like
a geek playing softball. l need some-
thing more physical."

Brosky began the team along with
his partner George Nassar three
years ago as an investment. He
there was room for “an
form" of football in

beheyed
alternative
Pittsburgh.

“There have always been a couple

    
   
       
   
   
   
     

of minor league teams in town. like
the Washington Generals or the Iron
Men. but none of them were organ-
i/ed enough to stay together for \‘L‘l‘_\’
long." Brosky said. “What we-‘re try-
ing to do is provide a complete form
of entertainment and at the same
time try and get these guys chances
to play in the pros.“

The pros are a distant pri/e that
shimmers in most players‘minds like
the Holy Grail. A few of them get
spots on Canadian teams or offers to
try out for an N Fl. club. but the fact
is that within a couple ofyears. most
of them are too old for the fast lane
and the limelight.

“There are a lot of professional
people playing ball here." Brosky
said. “Guy Miller works in his broth-
cr‘s business selling computers.
Shwartzmiller is involved in insu-
rancc, and Averill Harris has ajob at
Equitable Gas."

Harris. along with ex-Pitt star
Freddie Jacobs and Dave Robie, has
so far had the most successful ﬂirta-
tion with the pros. ln l977. Harris
played for the l.. A. Rams in the
preseason, but he was cut before reg-
ular play began.

Lamonde

Continues
To Impress

Ex-Pitt Panther Larry
l.amonde continues to impress the
Pittsburgh Pirates with his knuckle-
ball pitching for the Bucs Braden-
ton farm team.

Lamonde, the Pirates’ Zlst selec-
tion in June’s major league draft.
earned the tab “prospect” from
Pirate farm director Murray Cook
earlier this summer for his starting
pitching performances at Braden-
ton, a team in the Instructional
League. Now, Lamonde’s control of
his knuekleball apparently has
impressed the Bucs enough to earna
longer look this year.

The Pirates made Lamonde one
of three area players who will con-
tinue playing baseball during the
Instructional League‘s winter sea~
son. The other two players assigned
were catcher Mark Veon of Point
Park College and Mike Berger of
Central Catholic High School.

Scheduling Could Assist a Pitt Rise to T op 

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Sports Editor

lt could happen.

The l98l Pitt Panther football team a contcnder for the
national championship‘? The same team that made Pitt
coach Jackie Sherrill so nervous that he threw up before its
first game‘? A shot at the title that last year's Pitt power-
house, talent-laden with l2 NFL draftees, missed by an
eyelash‘?

Believe it. With an assist from the Panthers‘ much
maligned schedule, it could happen.

Consider the giant-killings that occurred this weekend.
Coach Bear Bryant’s No.2 Alabama team lost in a debacle
with Georgia Tech. No.7 Nebraska fell to lowa. And. in the
biggest crime of all, Wisconsin broke a four-year scoring
drought in its matchup with top-ranked Michigan, winning
the game 2l—l4.

The corpses are already lining the road to the title.

Ninth-ranked Pitt, idle last Saturday, should move up at
least to sixth in this week’s Top l0 and seems in little jeo-
pardy ofa fall from grace next week against the Cincinnati
Bearcats. Cardboard could have provided a stiffer test than
did the Bearcats in Saturday’s 52-0 loss to Penn State.

After Cincinnati, Pitt’s major tests promise to be away
against South Carolina in less than three weeks and home
contests against Florida State and Penn State later in the
season. A

South Carolina dropped its opener to Mississippi 20-l3
Saturday while Florida State defeated Memphis State. Both
South Carolina and Florida suffered heavy graduation
losses and, while certainly capable, they don’t appear to be
the teams they were last year. South Carolina will be espe-
cially lacking without Heisman Trophy winner George Rog-
ers and fellow No. 1 draft pick Willie Scott.

0* trite ¥7’itr:Newss‘,Monda:v: »°Sepwm‘beri‘f4. ‘#98 1

 

Provided Pitt doesn’t stub its toe against the also—rans like
Army or Temple. its l98l schedule could be tailor—made for
a top-ﬂight bowl bid, a necessary prerequisite fora chance at
the No. l spot.

The other ma_jor factor that bolsters Pitt’s chances for a
national championship can be traced to the tough schedules
of teams currently above or near Pitt in the national
rankings.

A slate that has current No. 8 Penn State playing
Nebraska, Alabama, Notre [)ame, Miami (Fla.) and Pitt
should yield at least one loss for the Nittany Lions if not,
they should be given the title on a silver platter. The l.ion
team would probably have a better chance staying unscathed
if it jumped from a l0-story building.

Fourth—ranked Notre Dame. in addition to Penn State,
faces Michigan this Saturday and Southern Cal, Florida
State, Purdue and Miami (Fla.) down the road.

Oklahoma, currently No. 3, should move up to No. I this
week, thanks to the Michigan and Alabama losses and the
Sooners' 37-20 win over Wyoming. But besides facing a
typically tough Big Eight lineup, including Nebraska, the
Sooners also lock up with Texas and Southern Cal.

The list of current top-ranked teams who face the specter
of similarly tough schedules goes on, prompting many
coaches no doubt to echo the sentiments of Florida State’s
Bobby Bowden, who said, “When you lay your schedule on
the table and the table tilts, you’re in trouble." '

It seems schedules may tilt a lot of teams‘ hopes this year.
And turn the tables in Pitt‘s favor.

Admittedly, it will take luck- a combination oflosses by
other teams and an undefeated Panther squad going into the
Nov. 28 game with Penn State to give Pitt a shot at the
national championship. While the Panthers‘ schedule isn‘t
loaded with heavyweights, it has enough tests against foes
like Joe Morris and Syracuse. or up-and-coming teams like
Boston College and West Virginia. to salvage respectability.
An undefeated record could make up for the rest. Look at
Georgia last year.

Of the current Top I0 teams, only No. 6 Georgia

approaches Pitt‘s good fortune in scheduling. The Dawgs‘ g
toughest opponents this year figure to be Florida, South 

Carolina and pesky Mississippi, led by quarterback John
Fourcade.

One thing that may hurt Pitt's chances in the eventuality it
can stay on the straight and narrow while others fall is the
Panthers’ curious lack of stature when mentioned in the
same breath as the Oklahomas. Notre Dames or Alabamas.

Despite the Panthers‘ overwhelming success in the last
nine years, christened with Tony l)orset,t’s arrival in I973,
Pitt often suffers from a second—class status outside the East.
lt is an important prejudice to consider since both wire
service rankings are based on a subjective voting system and
not a play-and-prove-it playoff system to determine a
national champion. 4

The system‘s deficiency showed last year. Pitt‘s delegation
to the Gator Bowl after being snubbed by the Sugar, Cotton
and Orange bowls for lesser teams with worse records. Evi-
dence: Alabama’s Cotton Bowl invitation despitetwo losses.

Wouldn‘t it be ironic if those bowls came knocking on
Sherrill’s door in November‘? Pitt couldn’t make it through

the front door last year, but this year the back door looks

wide open.
It could happen.

Giant-killers Rule as Michigan, Tide Fall

By STEVE GUIDAS

Upsets came early in the l98l col-
lege football season as three highly-
ranked teams lost in games played
Saturday.

Top-ranked Michigan, No. 2'Ala-
bama and seventh-ranked Nebraska
were upset by unranked teams in the
season’s first full weekend of play.

The Michigan Wolverines,
ranked No. l in many preseason
‘polls, lost its opener to the Wiscon-
sin Badgers 2l—l4. The loss was
Michigan head coach Bo Schem-
bechler’s first defeat on opening day
in l3 seasons and Michigan’s first to
Wisconsin since I962.

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistant Sports Editor

When asked what he thought of
his team (the Steelers) and its perfor-
mance on'Thursday Night Football.
one avid fan replied. “They aren’t
my Steelers anymore.”

After a decade of excellence and
invincibility. the Steelers obviously
have begun to fall on hard times.
Their fans. spoiled for a decade. are
beginning to throw in the towel. So
is the media.

i “The death ofa dynasty.”“the end

of an era” and many other cliches
have been attributed recently to the
Steelers. Are these descriptions fair
to a team that has achieved every-
thing there is to achieve-—FOUR

 

times‘? Are the Steelers dead. indeed‘?

Certainly the Steelers are not the
same. What team can be at the top of
its profession for so long‘? Neverthe-
less. the Steelers are approaching a
critical time in the next two weeks.
and Coach Chuck Noll has to make
some very tough decisions. He has to
decide whether a full-scale youth
movement or just some small
changes are needed to get the Steel-
ers back on top.

In the past week. the once—mighty
Steelers have looked like a ragtag
outfit. making both mental and
physical mistakes. But what the
Steelers seem to have lacked most is

 Steelers Need N ew Strateg

that fire. that desire. toj,ust come out

and blow teams away. They have ‘

been tentative. scared to take
chances-in short. they lack
confidence. ,,

In the first drive of the game
against the Dolphins. the Steelers
moved the ball down the field with
authority like. well...the way they
used to. But after an offside penalty
at the Miami I-yard line. the Steelers
had to settle for a field goal.

An experienced team like the
Steelers should have shrugged it off
and ‘just fought back at the Do]-
phins. Two years ago they would
have done that. But not Thursday
night. As everyone knows, the Steel-
ers broke down as a unit against a
young. well-coached team. The Dol-
phins looked like a team back on the
rise. They appeared hungry. eager
and unafraid.

Or were the Steelersjust that bad‘?

On the field. the problems are
numerous. The problem on defense
is clear-cut: there is no pass rush. In
the past. a young quarterback like
the Dolphins‘ Dav.id Woodley was
the kind of bait_the Steeler defense
thrived on. But the Steelers put no
pressure on him. and Woodley’s per-
formance reflected’ that.

What can Noll do?

For one. he can order up the blitz
more. It's an unpopular tactic with
coaches because it tends to leave the
belly of a defenseﬁthe middle—~
exposed and is therefore a potential
target for running backs out of the
backfield and slanting receivers. But
it can work. as evidenced in Atlanta.
where the Grits Blitz got the Falcons
to the playoffs.

Noll has another option. however.

recent work for the Colts is of any
value. he stands a decent chance of
making it somewhere. Harris led the
Mid-Atlantic Conference with 62
catches for l.l l5 yards and l3
touchdowns.

Brosky said he acquires most of
the talent for his team from around
the area. including a contingent of
former Pitt players led by Jacobs
and lineman Kurt Brechbill. The
bulk ofthe squad is taken from some
of the smaller local colleges that are

drafts. Pat Hahey. for example. the
Colts’ reserve quarterback. hails
from Behenay. where last year he
was named a small college All-
America.

Although the Coltsare a defense-
oriented ball club. the offense shines
at times. too.CWhile racking up 56
points Saturday. Brosky said that
Beer completed every pass he
attempted for a total of over 300
yards. , .

The lackluster defensive style of
play offered by Erie no doubt con-
tributed handsomely to several

Colts’ offensive averages. but there
were a few Colt plays that werejust
plain good football. One. for exam-
ple. was Pittsburgh’s Mike De Mich-
elie’s bizarre first touchdown catch

“Demo") is a skinny local kid with a
long ponytail that makes him look

L. C. Greenwood, Noll could go to‘
the increasingly popular 3-4 defense.
With an overabundance of quality
linebackers—-Jack Lambert, Dennis
Winston, Robin Cole, Zack Valen-
tine, Jack Ham and rookie David
Little—a 3-4 would not be a bad
move. The_re‘s a problem. though:
the players would have to be taught »
the 3-4--and fast.

The offensive problem is not as
easy to diagnose. Terry Bradshaw
can still be oneof the top quarter-
backs in the game, and the Steeler
receivers are excellent.

The Steeler running backs are i
questionable, yet Noll has to stick
with one lineup. Sidney Thorton,
opening day aside, isa good running
back. Franco Harris is old, granted,
but he still has some good years left.
Greg Hawthorne also has to carry
the ball more and stay healthy.

So what’s the solution? There is
none here, only opinions. Noll will
probably have to go back to the bas-

the Steeler defense.

Getting the team’s psyche in
order, however, should be Noll’s No.

the Steelers have to go out and prove
to themselves that they can still win.
That would bring back some ofthe
confidence~ and silence the critics.

HendrickHit Again

Injured
Panther
vows  
comeback

By AMIN GHOSSElN

Assistant Smarts Editor

The “key" to Pitt's defense, Coach
Jackie Sherrill had called him prior
to this year’s fall camp. Brochures
on the Pitt football program had
him listed as an A|l—East possibility.
John Hendrick was ready to blos-
som into a star. _

Even last year Hendrick. now a
junior, seemed toihave everything
going his way. But a crippling knee
injury in last year’s Kansas game put
him on the injured list. and the de-
fensive tackle from New Jersey has
not played one down of football
since.

After sitting out spring and fall
camps, Hendrick’s career is threat-
ened. Some Pitt trainers, in fact,
seem to think his career is already
over,

_A step was taken to figure out
Hendrick’s fate last week when doc-
tors performed surgery to remove
loose cartilage in his left knee.
According to Hendrick, the surgery
was successful, and he plans to be
back in four weeks.

As optimistic as Hend rick" sounds.
it was nevertheless a blow that Hen-
drick had to have a second opera-
tion. Sherrill, who had so much
confidence in Hendrick, has already
said he does not expect a contribu-
tion from him this year.’

Only time will tell whether John
Hendrick will play again. Once the
“key” to the defense, Hendrick has
now become the question mark.
