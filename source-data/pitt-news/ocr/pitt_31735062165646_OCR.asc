Sharing of Libraries Possible

‘Pooling’

The Universityihas high hopes that a study being made

by Chancellor Litchfield, the

presidents of the four other

Pittsburgh colleges and the Mellon Institute will produce

real beneﬁts for the students heie and the. community as ‘a interested in a Separate Org-am_
whole, according to Russell R. Jalbert, director of Public zation for community service,”

Relations at the University. 9 -

The participants are making a
study of the possibility of sharing
faculties, facilities, and possibly
research efforts. They hope to
obtain an inventory of each
stitution’s present program
future plans.

Taking part in the mctings are
Dr. J. C. Warner, president of
Carnegie Institute of '.I‘echnology;
Dr. Edward D. Eddy, Jr., presi-
dent of Chatham College; Sister

and

M M. Muriel, president of Mt. Mer-

Cross, president of Mellon Insti-
tute of Industrial Research; and
Chancellor Litchﬁeld.

“Despite these obstacles there
are enormous. possibilities for
service to the Pittsburgh com-
munity as well as the economy

within the institutions,” he
added.
“We can’t work too hard to

provide the best possible educa-
tion for the students here,” Jalbert
stated. “This study is an explora-
tion in that direction.”
Faculty Shortages
“We’re all faced with faculty
shortages,” Dr. Eddy continued.
“What's the point of perpetuating
mediocrity in live when we can
have excellence by co-operation?”
Jalbert explained that “the
study is related to the Oakland
Corporation, to the Pitt-Tech-
Mellon Organization, and to the
Chancellor's and the entire
communities concern to bring

in-«

greater research facilities into
the area to help spur the econ-
omy."

“This is just a study,” Jalbert
stressed. “It is going very slowly
and carefuly.”

All of the presidents spoke of
the need of small steps at. first.
“There’s no sense to any scheme
to fuse all six institutions into a
Greater Monongahela University
and a giant educational enter-
prise,” Dr. Eddy, concluded. “Such
a plan would immediately destroy
the individual institutions and
long traditions of alumni loyalty
and support.”

gram.

‘Mikado’ seen

By IVIARILYN EIGES

The University T h e a t e r
transformed Stephen Foster

of Titipu in a lively and suc-
cessful presentation of the

I “Mikado” last week.

The curtain opened on a.per-
fectly stylized choreography by
the chorus of “Gentlemen of
Japan” which was, happily, to

"consistently enliven the remainder

of the play. Costumes and make-
up were also immediately effec-
tive.

Although the

tains gave a certain heaviness
which not even the light scene
painting could completely allay.

Heaviness was also apparent in
the opening song of Pooh-Bah,
Bob Bays, although he subse-
quently drew more into the spirit
of his part.

Bob Sestili played a consistent-

he completely captured each scene

Gov’t Agencies   Seek

Federal jobs in the Civil
Service, contrary to popular
student opinion, are not
synonymous with post office
positions and low pay, accord-
ing to Dr. Walter M. Riten-

our, director of the University
Placement Service.

Representatives from the U.S.
Civil Service Commission and
other government agencies will
join representatives from indus-
try at the Careers Conference for
Liberal Arts Students Thursday
and Friday in the SU Ballroom.

These include the Social Se-
curity Administration, the Inter-
nal Revenue Service, the State
Department, Central, Intelligence
‘Agency, United States Informa-
tion Service, and the Navy Sup-
ply .Depot. They will‘ also con-
duct their own examinations or

recruit through campus inter-
viewing.
Given Monthly

The Federal Service Entrance
Examination and the Management
Intern Examination are given
monthly in the Cathedral. Stu-
dents passing the ﬁrst test in the
morning are eligible for the sec-
ond in the afternoon.

Students passing only the
FSEE are eligible for appoint-
.ment, but the two percent pass-
ing both are “eagerly sought
after,” according to Ritenour.

University students graduating
in the top quarter of their class
who qualify through the FSEE
earn a starting annual salary of
$5540, _compared to $4565 for the
rest.

HAP/P—Y TALK

As we all know, conversation is terribly important on a date. I‘
When lulls in the conversation run longer than an hour or two, '

one’s partner is inclined to grow logy—even sullen. But oc-
casionally one ﬁnds it difficult to keep the talk going, especially
when one is having a ﬁrst date with one. What, then, does one do?

If one is wise, one follows the brilliant example of Harlow
Thurlow. ‘

Harlow Thurlow prepares.'That is his simple secret. When
Harlow is going to take out a new girl, he makes sure in advance
that the conversation will not languish. Before the date, he
goes to the library and reads all 24 volumes of the encyclopedia
and transcribes their contents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure
that no matter what his date’s interests are, he will have ample
material to keep the conversation alive.

Take, for example, Harlow’s ﬁrst date with Priscilla do
Gasser, a ﬁne, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl, lavishly
constructed and rosy as the dawn. « ‘

Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for Priscilla,
and, as always, he did not start to converse immediately. First

he took her to dinner because, as everyone knows, it is useless ‘I ‘

to try; to make conversation with an unfed coed. Her attention
span IS negligible. Also, her stomach rumbles so loud it is diffi-
cult to make yourself heard.

So he took her to a ﬁne steak house where he stoked her with
gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French fries and thick-
ets of escarole and battalions of petit fours. Then, at last,
dinner was overand the waiter brought two ﬁnger bowls.

looking everywhere for a boy who can carry on aintelligcnt
coggrilimeeflrcli is ended, madam,” said Harlow, and pulled
back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a likely topic to
start the conversation.

‘ Oh, woe! Oh, lackaday! Those cuffs on which Harlow had
painstakingly transcribed so many facts—tl1ose cuffs on which
he had noted such diverse and fascinating information—tl1ose
cuffs, I say, were nothing now but a. big, blue blur! For Harlow
-—poor Harlow !—splashing around in the ﬁnger bowl, had gotten
his cuffs wet and the ink had run and not one word was legible!
And Harlow—poo‘r Ha5low!(-i—looked upon his cuffs and broke
out in a night sweat an fell umb. '

“I must say,” said Priscilla a.fter several silent hours, “that
you are a very dull fellow. I’m leaving.”

With that she ﬂounced away and poor Harlow was too
crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a cigarette.

All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. “Was that,” she
asked, ‘:a Marlboro you just lit?’i ~

, .

“'I‘af1se’n  zﬁllilgtve dull fellow,” she cried, and sprang into’
his lap. “You are bright! Anybody is bright to smoke such 9.

‘ Fifth Adrift

The idea of expanding the experimental housing pro-
‘ gram in the men’s dormitories is commendable if there is
more reason for it than merely the participants’ “enthusi-
asm” for the program. That the members of the ﬁfth floor
of Schenley are pleased with what they have experienced
there this year is beyond doubt; that enough interested stu-
 dents exist to ﬁll two more ﬂoors of intellectualism remains
“— to be seen.

As has been done at some of the most highly regarded
“institutions in the country, the University has tried to build
. a dormitory situation .which would include an academic or
A intellectual atmosphere along with the foot—lockers and pin-
up calendars. The present members of the experimental
"community, who entered the program on a voluntary basis,
have apparently made a‘ sincere effort to create such an
atmosphere.

,_ These students invited a wide variety of "speakers to
their congregation and various ﬁelds of the humanities and
social sciences were delved into and debated. In addition,
the students also took it upon themselves to openly discuss
and criticize a work by a University professor.

The members "of the experimental group, who have
been described by their ﬂoor counselor as being “generally
‘ political active”, also found themselves somewhat embar-
rassed when they expressed a desire to hear American Hit-
lerist George Lincoln Rockwell as a part of their political
forum and were checked by the University’s common sense.
Publicity of the incident also seemed to create a mild panic
among the members of the experimental group.

This episode and the ﬁoor’s involvement in the recent
political picketing on campus have caused many t-o wonder
about the success of the program and the degree of maturity
of some of the members. / -

,_ At any rate, sincere as the participants may be, the ac-

complishments of the group, both the good and the bad,
‘seem to lack any creative effort. Listening to speakers and
discussing a play are commendable but we had hoped for a
- more substantial kind of activity from the experimental
intellectual housing. As the true intellectual is the creative
thinker, so will it require creativity, not just enthusiasm,
to merit the expansion of the experimental housing pro-
gram.

umpoviger, Rosita Whitman,’

Not long ago I was standing in front of the
Brooks Atkinson Theater in New York, musingly
observing strollinghumanity and waiting for the
ticket window to open, when I was aware of an
insistant tugging at the bottom
of my coat sleeve. Re—aligning
my strained lapels, I looked
down and found myself staring
into the dirt—besmeared face of
a little girl of not more than ten
years. Her lace-fringed pinafore
was dirt—besmeared, and in dirt-
besmeared ﬁngers she clutched
an artiﬁcial orchid which she I‘
thrust up into my surprised’ face.’
My . ﬁrst thought .was, “Hm,
what a dirt-besmeared little
girl.” My second thought was, “Uh—oh."

“What can I do for’ you,” I asked smilingly.

“Buy a ﬂower for the lady, mister, please,” she
said pleadingly. .

That’s w,hat I was afraid of. The lady i=n this
case was a girl from my home town who‘ was now
contemplating the theater marquee and feigning
ignorance of the entire situation. The only thing
to do was pretend deafness.

“What was that?” I asked cupping my hand
over my ear. But the little urchin would not have
been put off so easily if I had been Napoleon.

“Please buy a ﬂower, mister. Only a dollar.”
Suddenly, I felt a sharp stab of pain in the
gluteous maximus, right around the area of my’
wallet pocket. Humor her a little, I thought. \

Cheaper ‘By the Dozen? _

“A dollar foran artiﬁcial ﬂower?” I asked with
a humoring sort of chuckle. “It can’t be worth
more than a dime. Fifteen cents at the most.” But,
silently praising Allah that the little brat was
selling only artiﬁcial ﬂowers ‘instead of lifetime
guaranteed Graff Zeppelins, I—~r'eached, with arth-
ritic steadiness, "for/my billfold.

Now, I've always liked to think of myself as
possessing a certain amount of worldly acumen,
some small measure of experience and knowledge.

Not that I swagger around swinging an ivory-A

tipped cane and spewing out time-tempered philos-
ophies over champagne cocktails and caviar ca-
napes, but in my mind I occupy a position on a
scale ‘somewhere between the mundane and Errol
Flynn, most assuredly a good deal to the left of
center, but still somewhere between. Perhaps I
ought to amend my conception of value. Either
that or carry American Express Travellers Cheques._

I am chagrined to confess that there have been
other times when I have been the victim of some
sable—tongued professor of the pleading eye, like
that little girl, but I am also forced to admit that
she put on an Oscar-deserving performance. It
was too bad that Stanley Kramer or Cecil B. De-
Mille wasn’t around. Not that I care about her act-
ing, but maybe one of them could have paid my
dollar. ‘ A

Open Season — No Limit . .

It might be that I’m particularly susceptible to
little girls. It might be,. but it isn’t. To be per-
fectly honest, I’m fair ga-me for almost anybody,
and the trouble is that sucker season is open the
year round. I really have no respect for the person
who tries‘ to 'ﬂ'e_ec_e me,’ especially if hesucceeds.
I’m too game. There’s no sporting challenge in
relieving" me of a couple of bucks. It’s easier than

hitting the broad side of a battleship with a inatzoh _

ball at four paces." , ,

Actually, I could’ forgive myself for succumbing
to the charms of the little girl. There is something
endearing about those little sirens". After all, she
was "only about ten years old, with. a dirty face,
dirty dress, and’ very scuffed sandals. ‘

I’m rationalizing. .

Well, I guess my mildly,paranoid illusions have
been shattered. I’m ﬁnally realizing that the invis-
ible emotion-proof shield ‘is porous — as porous
as a collander. I can’t walk into a restaurant,‘ a.
nightclub, or even a washroom, without being bled
of about twenty percent more than my budget
allows; The washroom attendant, the nightclub
photographer, the bowery' gutter-bum —— they’re
all after me and me alone. I feel like Solomon in

By’ Bill Bennett

While recently perusing thework of Sir Thomas
Malory, I pondered the standard cletraction of
works of this ilk: that they are so naively fantastic" I
that they go beyond the realm of even slight ~
credibility and are thus rendered .
not only foolish "but" uninterest-
ing. It rmust surely have been
a blase time indeed when these
comic strip supermen and their
propitiously magic world were
seriously considered as the stuff
good literature was made on. We
sophisticated type folk, of course.
know better.

But let us now consider the
electronic device which is All
Things to iAll Men. Here we
have Paladin, that perfect gentle knight who car-
ries such compendious knowledge_‘neath his black
nat and weekly smites down a host of enemies
without receiving so much as a scratch in return.
Or Eliot Ness, that podgy revenuer teveed into the
world’s greatest nemisis of crime since the Phan-
tom. All over again, in the century which Knows
Better, we have our Noble Adventure of the Castle
Perilous and the King Who was Emperor through
the Strength of His Own Hands.

The Past. Revisited

And this is as it should be. Just as Malory’s
knight’s and sorcerors were part of a nostalgically—
remembered past when he wrote about them, so
the Wild West and Roaring Twenties are sul‘Ticient—

By ROSITA VVHITIVIAN

An education, practically and
symbolically, is the most important
factor in the struggle for the
world, according to Paul Niven,
Washington news analyst for
CBS, who spoke at the Wednes-
day Midday Series.

Niven, in. his usual objective
manner, reviewed the results of
the recent Congressional ‘elec-
tions. He explained that the re-
sults showed a most important
victory for the President. “The

governorships of Michigan, Ohio,

and Pennsylvania will do much

to dilute the image of Republican *

shortsightedness,” remarked Niv-
en. V I

Speaking on his change of at-
titude on the Cold War from res-

ignation to defense of the USA,,

Niven outlined the advantages ‘of
the USSR over the USA.‘Pri-
marily, the existence in every
country of a communist ‘party
either clandestine or open. Sec-
ondly, the rapidity of the USSR’s
development of their aid.to un-
derdeveloped countries. Finally,
the race question is their;strong-
est advantage. Niven asked, “How
long are we going. to‘ allow this.
nonsense at home to impair our
relations abroad?” '
Practical Education

Niven reiterated, “Education it-

self is practical and symbolic. In‘

no other country is education
more respected than in the USSR.
The Bolsheviks have vested more
in edxcation to replace the loss.»
of ’a religious philosophy. Edu-
cation is least respected in the
USA.”

Niven pointed out that the
power of a country is determin-
ed by its use of resources. The
Soviet has directed their re-
sourees toward the central na-
tional power; whereas the USA
has directed their thrust to-
ward the consumer’s national
product. -

“Queued up before a store
waiting to buy something, one
American remarkedlto another,
‘They have idiots selling things
in USSR and geniuses designing
rockets, but its the opposite in
the USA,” said Niven.

‘Soviets Unwilling
“No subject on which the Soviet

‘is less willingto speculate than

on their relationship with Red
Chinese,” stated Niven. ‘ _
Niven commented_ on the
main factor that forced him to
revise his‘ utter gloom-leader-
ship. “I felt in 1957 when the
Sputnik was sent up we needed
a little instrospection, but Ike
did not even care what was go-
ing on,” he said. Niven, said that
he had never seen an operation
conducted with such skill as the
Cuban Crisis. 0
For six years we are going to
have an able administration.
“Nevertheless,” Niven maintained,
“we are not out of the woods.”
He concluded, “We must go on
with unprecedented courage. The
Cold War will last much longer
than we will live.”
REQUIRED STUDENT FEES at
the University of Colorado are $36
per semester, as recommended by

‘ the student-faculty ﬁnance board.

Foreign Students Approve
SC Plan; First Meeting Held

Foreign ‘students “a g r e e
very much with the “program”
outlined bythe Student Gov-

ernment F».oi'.r e i g n Student.

Committee-,” according to SG
Vice-president Judy Diethorn
and Burmese exchange student

Han Nyo, even though there was-

some disagreement as to the ef-
fectiveness ojf the ﬁrst meeting.
7 This ﬁrst organizational meet-
ing, held the week before Thanks-
giving,.was held to explain the
suggested proposal and “at the
same time air ideas and gain a
ﬁrm understanding of the pur-
pose,” Miss Diethorn said.

“Five or six” foreign students
who had expressed_their interest
in the committee to Renee Lich-
tenstein of the Office of Cultural
and Educational Exchange, and
about 12 American students at-
tended. '_

Han Nyo Explained

Han Nyo explained that the
foreign students‘ ‘want “to see
American and foreign students
working together. If we stay in
our national groups, which is only

we won’t learn anything. We must
mix.”

The main suggestion at this
ﬁrst meeting was for an inter-
national room, a lounge where
foreign students could meet
and hold planned events.

Han Nyo suggested that the
committee contact representatives
from each nation on speciﬁc is-
sues so that “a common basis, can
be ‘reached. Individual problems
can't be solved through this com-
mittee.”

Expressed Dissatisfaction

In a letter to the editor of The
Pitt News, Han Nyo also ex-

_pressed his dissatisfaction at the

way the meeting was run. “The
outcome of the last meeting‘ of
the ‘organizational meeting was
nothing but confusion,” he ex-
plained. He felt that the written
outlines of the proposal that were
passed out were not suiﬁcient ex-
planation.

_“The foreign students expected
something more formal that what
we usually have as a committee
meeting,” Miss Diethorn ex-
plained. “We did get off on some
small points, but the time was
well spent. Nothing should be

natural in a new environment, considered irrelevant”,

into area school systems.

Dr. Glaser, a former pupil of
Dr. Skinner’s, pointed out that
the University’s program learn-

were interested, the opportunity
to participate as a group in an
extracurricular program designed
to broaden their cultural and edu-
cational interests.” _

Students were notiﬁed about
the program last year through

the Dean of Men’s office, and

this summer during. freshmen

orientation programs. 38 stu-

dents were selected through ap-

plications and interviews to

participate in the program.

"The program of the ﬂoor has

_ thus farincluded Dr. Lionel Roth-

krug, who spoke on “America’s
Greatest Challenge-Communism
or Fascism.” The ﬂoor attended
Theatre 1l’s production of Lawr-
ence Lee’s dramatic poem, An
American as Faust, and then re-
viewed the production with Lee
and Bernard Engel who directed
the performance.
Discussed With Heath

‘Most recently the group partici-
pated in a discussion with Dr. Roy
Heath of the University guidance
center about “The Objectives of
the Student and _the Role of the
University.” In addition programs
dealing with history, anthropol-
ogy, and philosophy have also
been held. . ~

Christopher Calvin, freshman

«LA, explained: “I joined the
ﬁfth ﬂoor, because it‘ promised
to be an interesting, lively
place. I am not disappointed.”

Another resident commented:
.“,This ﬁfth ﬂoor-program provides
my only intellectual stimulation at

Expanded to New Dorms

the University of Pittsburgh.
.Without the Fifth of Schenley my
days wouldhave been very shal-
low indeed.”

Jim Seabol, a Graduate student
in the Speech Department, who is
the floor counselor, said that he
would like very much to serve as
counselor again next year “as long
as the expansion does not destroy
the close interaction of the group.”

Group of 38
, .When_ asked about the group of
'38 he has been working with, he
commented that “they are gen-
erally more intellectually alive

than most other students.” He
continued, “their other distin-
guishing characteristic is their

variability ——- the fact that there
is no common denominator, that
there is a multiplicity of different
interests, backgrounds, and atti-
tudes.” ’

According to Jerry -Whalen,
there is a long list of numerous
faculty members who have in-
dicated their interest and en-
thusiasm about the program and
who will be willing to appear
before the group.

Whalen said that any interested
students are welcome to sign up
for the program, and can do so
by ﬁlling out a special section of
-the new dormitory, application
blanks which will be available in
January.

“If this kind of program con-
tinues to‘ be successful, then liv-
ing in Pitt’s residence halls will

become a unique experience for
future students,” he concluded.

I 962 ‘Owl ’
Gets/1 ward

The 1962 Owl has won first
class honor ‘rating in the As-
sociated Collegiate Press
Yearbook Institute, scoring
6000 points. The college year
book missed the All Ameri-
can rating by 100 points.

“The Owl’ (1962) has an exten-
sive coverage, varied campus ac-
tivities. Photos are lively and gen-
erally well cropped,” the judges
commented on the student life
coverage.

The 1962 Owl writing drew this
comment, “Excellent: lively and
Creates mood very well
indeed.”

Lost Points

The year book lost points for
variation in top and bottom mar-
gins and for too much white
space. The judges also felt that
all the pictures needed captions.

Bill Schnieder, editor of 1962

Owl, said, “we disagree with
the gentlemen on these topics.
All this is a matter of personal
taste, numerous experts have
commended us for producing
one oi‘ the best year books they
have ever seen.

“The 1961 Owl took, first place
in, the Pi Delta Epsilon contest
over , the Associated Collegiate
Press All American Awardees.
Thus, we disagree with many of
his judgments."

Cover Comment

The Cover of 19': Owl. drew
the comment that it was very dis-
tinguished and unusual.

“We do not feel that the use
of white space is not excessive
and we purposely varied the
margins to give freshness and
relief to the gray looking year
book.” Schnieder said, ‘‘In sev-
eral instances use of captions
would be trite, the photos are of
subjects the students see every
day. Those that needed captions
have been captioned."

The 1963 Owl editor, Joel Fil-
ner, confided that the year book
now in lormation has several new
features and innovations. “96
pages wil be in two colors, new
cover material will be used. A
new design and application with
a new, modern type design, re-
cently introduced from Germany
will also be used.

“To our knowledge there have

According to Hodges, there are
deﬁnitely‘ conﬂicts, between block
tests and those scheduled by per-
iod, but they are “very, very
few.” The schedule was checked

through a computer before being
accepted.

This is the ﬁrst time for sev-
eral years that a ﬁnal exam per-

stated this summer during the

THE KEY CLUB

Guard Tim Grgurich is still too young to warrant a, key
to the Beau Brumrnel Club orthe Gaslight Assn. of Shady-
side, but he may be the turnkey of an ambitious Panther

Coach Bob Timmons has_ labeled him the key to a good
season although he is the worst shot on the starting team.

On Friday evening Grgurich was wandering around the.

Field House, saying he was trying to ﬁnd the “key.”

_ Well, apparently he found it. Grgurich put the team into
the lead for the ﬁrst time wi_th two consecutive ﬁeld goals
after three minutes of play, advancing Pitt to a 7-6 lead.

Tim Grguricli _ _
would use a zone against "us and we practiced against it
all “week. They played a .much more aggressive defense
this year.” ' l ‘

He went on to be the vanguard of a mercurial fast—break-

ing offense that. put Purdue
oniitsi retreating heels, bow-

ing, 69-64. The junior back-
rcourtman was credited with

four assists, stole’ the ball
twice and deflected two pass-
es out of bounds.

g "No. 34 Hurf _Us

He was singled out by Pur-

'due coach Ray Eddy as a

deﬁnite factor in his te_am’s
defeat. “That No. 34 hurt.us,”
Eddy said. -“He zinged in a

they meet Northwestern in
an attempt to duplicate their

69-54 win over Purdue Saturday
night at the Field House.

Northwestern also opened its
season with a win Saturday, de-

‘feating Western Michigan, 83-74.
In scoring the win the Wildcats

lived up to Coach’ Bill Rohr’s
prediction of his team.

“This year,” said Rohr, “we
should have the smoothest operat-
ing and best shooting ban club
we’ve had in my six years at
Northwestern. The only question
is, are we going to be able to‘ get
possession of the ball often en-
ough to capitalize on our shooting
ability.” _

D The Wildcats height is on a par
with the Panthers. Center John
Miller is 6-5 and -one of the start-
ing, forwards will be" either 6-4

sen. The other forward, spot will

Timmons has given‘ the team a widerfast-breaklpattern

we never thought of leaving the zone.

“If you look at their shot chart, I’ll bet you’ll ﬁnd _
that theytook most of their shots from more than, fifteen

S-Matmen Prepare For

Eight Match Season

, By BOB SMIZIK
, Matches with traditional rivals Lehigh and Penn State
-highlight the eight-meet‘ schedule of the Panther wrestling

team for the 1963 season.

r

The wrestlers will be out to better last year’s mark ’of
7-1-1. To make matters even tougher, three of the teams that
were defeated by the Panthers last year are not on the new

schedule.

Navy, Northwestern and Cor-
all losers to the Panthers
have been dropped from the
schedule. Iowa State and Michi-
gan State have been added to give

the team eight matches instead
of the usual nine.
7 Michigan First .
The season opens for the

wrestlers January 5 when they
host Michigan,’ a team that tied
them 13-13 last season. Iowa State
is the next home match for the
grapplers but it will be held at
Washington, Pa., instead of the
Field House, January 9.

On succeeding weeks the team

laces. Syracuse away and has

home meets with Maryland and

Army. After a week lay~off the

wrestlers go on the road, meet-

in: Michigan State, Lehigh and
. Penn State.

In the past the Panthers‘ have
handled the opponents on this
season’s card well as evidenced
by the 46-21-3 record they hold
against the eight teams on the

1963 schedule.

State Leads

‘The only team to hold the edge
over the Panthers is Penn State,
who have won seven of the 13
meetings between the teams with

one match ending in a tie.
Michigan has a 6-6-1 record
against the Panthers. Lehigh
rhas done fairly well managing
to cop three wins to the Pan-
thers ﬁve and one tie. Others
have not fared so well with

‘Liberati, McGraw

f Up for Recognition

Coach Leo Bemis feels that

Halfback Paul Liberati and Full-

back Andy McGraw have the
best. chance to gain national rec-
ognition of the soccer players on
his unbeaten team.

Liberati was an honorable men-

tion selection last year, and both

he and McGraw have drawn a lot
of raves this year. He thinks
Corky Cuthbert’s chances are
slim since the center-forward
position is the hardest ‘spot to
make. He will get strong local
attention, however, as will some

others, according to Bemis.

O

Syracuse winless in eight at-
tempts and Maryland in six
tries.

Army is on the short end of a
9-2 record against the Panthers
in the all-time standings and
Michigan State has also won twice
in eight attempts. Iowa State has
split even with the Pittsburghers
in two meetings.

Peery -and . his inexperienced
team have their work cut out for
them if they are to, maintain
these ﬁne records.

F rosh Cagers
Stronger Says
Carl Peterson

Coach Carl Peterson says his
freshman basketball team appears
to be as strong as last year’s club
which compiled an 11-5 record.

Peterson will begin his eleventh
year at the helm Saturday when
his team meets Johnstown College
in the season lid-lifter.

The big man on this year’s team
will be Bob Lovette, a 6-6 center
from York, Pa. He and guard
Larry Szykowny of North Catholic
High" here in Pittsburgh are the
only two scholarship-holders on
the team.

Another General-

Steve Eisman and Nick Gener-
alovich will start at forward and
Ted Lazzaro will team up with
Szykowny in the backcourt.

Peterson said that. he is de-
pending on Gene Tamburino
and Fred Hoglin. two football
players, for additional board
strength.

Peterson added that he expected
Lazzaro to be the playmaker of the
team. “He’s a little guy,” he said.
“But the way he handles the ball
is amazing.” He added that Brian
Ge_nera1ovich’s brother, Nick, is
well-schooled in the game and is
short on errors.

ed three goals in two games and
two goals in ﬁve games during his

nastics team in the coming season.
. The newcomers are Bill Shene-
felt, .Jack Schwar, and Bob
Malloy, Shenefelt is a specialist in
the still rings and Malloy in the
parallel bars. Schwar will try to r
ease the loss of All-American Earl

Ed Zamecnik, a -senior, will

probably be the ace of the team,

WPGH Broadcasts

Basketball

Con tests

Campus radio station WPGH will broadcast the home
games of the Panthers’ basketball team and a few of the
‘away games this season, according to station general manager

Dan Johnson.
Barry eWeiser will handle

the play-by-play segment of '

the broadcasts and Rick Margraff, a freshman football player,

will do the color.

“Our ultimate hope in- broadcasting the games is to get
more interest in the team,” Johnson said. “We hope to get
students acquainted with the team through the broadcasts. _

Once they hear what the team 9
is doing, perhaps they’ll start
going to the Field House for
the games.”

Johnson says this will not en-
courage students to stay in the
dorms instead of going to see the
game in action. “Our service will
be extended mainly to. students
who can’t leave their studies that
long and for the students who
haven’t -had basketball interest
aroused in them before,” he said.

When the cost is not prohibi-
tive thestation plans to send -a
team with the basketball‘ team on

the roadto recreate asmany away
games as possible. .

Harriers Fell To
Conference Titlists
During 2-5 Year

The Panther cross—country team
which slumped to a dismal 2-5 re-
cord this fall can give the same
excuse as the football team does
for a losing record.

Except for Penn State and Kent
State, the harriers met all con-'
ference champions on their sched-
ule. Ohio U. topped the, eight-
team Mid-American conference.
Navy headed the Heptagonal loop,
which included the Ivy League
and Army. P

West Virginia was the South-
ern Conference winner and
Slippery Rock was the State
Teachers College titlist.

Ohio U. blanked Michiganstate,
