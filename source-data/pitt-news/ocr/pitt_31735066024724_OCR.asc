Pill News Slolf Writer

At‘5-foot-7'/2, with a perfect fig-
ure, blond curly hair, light brown
eyes, a dark suntan and a tiny tur-
quoise bathing suit, he’s every girl‘s
dream. Dave Hawk, weighing inat

I84 pounds, won first place at the

Mr. Teenage Pittsburgh Contest
March l4 at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall. , ‘

Hawk, a Pitt Freshman business
major, began his bodybuilding
career two years ago and now dedi;
cates his life to it.

“I love bodybuilding,” Hawk said.
“Even though the training is hard,
it’s all worth it in the end. It takes a
lot of dedication, but it’s what l want
to do with my life.”

For Hawk, dedication is working _‘ c_

and maintaining a rigorous diet. H-is .-

times a week, concentrating on the
Nautilus equipment.

“I never miss a workout, even if
l‘m sick or hurt," the North Hills
bodybuilder’said., “l’ve trained with
a temperature of 103 -degrees and

’ V injuries, too. You’ve got to learn to

train with pain, and if you love it as
much as I do, you train regardless.”

Approximately 2 1/2
months before a

programs funded by the board must

The board recommended that the
Studio Theater and the Allocations
Committee discuss the possibility of
student government funding for all
seven produ°ctions. Admission
would be free for CAS students and
the problem of who would receive
the, proﬁts would be eliminated.

The Studio Theater_ also
requested tools and a telephone ans-
wering machine. The answering
machine request was rejected

. because of the board's policy not to
fund office equipment until Student .

Union renovations are finished.

Abraham said that the policy
includes allorganizations whether
they are located in the Student or
not. “It is more fair not to fund office
equipment for everyone rather than
penalize groups in the Student
Union,” he explained.

In ‘Heaven’
and Other Places...

By J.D. KLEINKE
r-ntertmrm~.+~nl Erlitor

“Tonight was the first night we
ever felt like a punk band." joked
Whereabouts lead guitarist Sam
after a less than warm reception at
Heaven. But then again. nobody
ever promised anybody anything.

The Whereabouts are by no
stretch of the acthestic imagination
a “new wave" band; and that is
exactly what the people of Heaven
thought they were getting. Keep in
mind what Heaven is. An arro-
gant pseudo—splash of midtown
Manhattan in Pittsburgh. The
place reeks of its (res (‘hie trend-
chasingi Give or take a few notice-
able years.

Like John, drummer for the _
Whereabouts described the even-
ing, it was “the punks versus the
discocrats.” Ammunition for the
fray was an unabated avalanche of
slurred barr chords on one side
and a sea of self—important smirks
on the other. The regulars didn’t
like it. .

The difference is essentially this:
the Whereabouts play for a looser
crowd across town in a place
called The Electric Banana. where
the tacky red velvet wallpaper is
outdone only by the red Christmas
lights-—those that still work. But
the crowd is as loyal as it is
bizarre. and makes one forget the
buck and a quarter canned brews.

Maybe the Heaven thing was an
image problem. The Whereabouts
are loud. fast, and grab you by
throat. Where Devo and the Pis-
tols are pigeon-holed by the
“punk“ label, the Whereabouts are
not. They are a volatile band with

5 a double-edged tendency toward »
4 Angel City/ Who metal on one

side, and a thicker set of satirical
lyrics on the other. Coming out
somewhere in the middle, the

guitar blitzkrieg isn’t overwhelm-
ing. Sort of like a catholic school
version of the Ramones. They
kind of look that way too. But
they certainly are not punk.

Punk is too much ofan image
thing. When a bunch of high
school kids show up at Point Park
College to hear Carsickness and
the Five in skinny ties. old sun-‘
glasses. and alligator shirts, some-
thing isn't quite right. Maybe it’s

_too much “Whippet” on Rock-

world or the new wave segments
on Evening Magazine.

“People think new wave is Blon-
die and Pat Benatar,” says Sam.
And hence. we uncover the source
of all the confusion. ls all of this
genuinely music, or is it an illusion
grown too big for its shorts’?
Either way, it all started as a big
misnomer, was media-blown out
of proportion, and is now a bad
joke for bands like the
Whereabouts.

Again thegenre is not punk
rock;'it is alternative rock. But the
credibility of the genre as a whole
has been jeopardized, its perspec-
tive grossly distorted.

Whereabouts really have little to.
do with the tutti-frutti hairdo
facade.

“We play music we like to
hear,” say Rick, “stuff we couldn’t
hear anywhere else.” The rest of
the band agrees emphatically.

“We’re characterized by our lim-
itations,” adds Jeff, the band’s
lead singer and lyricist. Limita-

'The Whereabouts and their sibling

harzcls will always play; the trouble is
that no one will carve out a place for
them“ except themselves.’

“We‘re not really punk." says

Sam of the Whereabouts

music. “We play hyper—speed rock
and roll." Fast and danceable, he
and the other band members point
out.

tions which appear to be many.
Now we arrive at the real Wherea-
bout sensibility. The one shared by
countless artists across the world:
You know the clique. The tightly
budgeted musicians trying real
hard. Microphones are held
together with tape; inadequate
amplifiers are trumped up with
sound boxes; the drums held
together_with ardent prayer. And
much of the equipment is shared
with two or three other bands.

But there is a romanticism
about it all. Perhaps it is the
cohesion. Or the struggle. The
history of the band suggests both.

The Whereabouts are all Pitt
students or recent graduates. The
band’s geneology rings up names
that are most affectionately
Oakland. _

“We came from the Towers like
anyone else,” said Rick. Three of

the five Whereabouts came from
the same co—ed floor in Tower B, a
floor which “was terrorized,”
remembers former floor member -
Pam Walters.

The band was conceived in a
Louisa Street apartment. Sam had
his old Fender. Rick’s makeshift
bass consisted of the last four
strings of a guitar. Brian beat on
old beer cases until‘ he could get
hold of a legitimate guitar. They
had no drummer at the time. It
was then that the band wrote-its
first song.“Decept” which is now a
standout on Made in Pittsburgh,
Volume III and receives occasional
radio airplay. V I g

Practices were eventually moved
to Jeff’s room in the Brackenridge
dormitory. Finally, the Wherea.-_
bouts found John through
Richard Waddingha_m who was in
Soho’s Equus with him at the
time. L

Then came the first gig. It was
in Rick’s Semple Street apartment
when the anticipatedvcrowd of
twenty showed up at the door a
hundred and fifty strong. The
quarter keg went fast.

That spring saw the Lion ‘Walk
Performing Arts Center benefit .

and the Whereabouts" first assault
on the public. On"a bill with ,
eleven other bands, the benefit and
those that followed went well; too
well; and the place had to, be shut
down.

And Brackenridge was no
longer available. So the audito-

Despite “having to haul all our
shit there in shopping carts,"

remembers Sam, the Whereabouts if

overcame the inconvenience with
the genuine desire to plug on.
Hard’ times, you know; the cliche
continues.

Then came September and
Clubb Dry. Three of the band _
members moved into a house on
Ward Street, and the basement

quickly became the practice studio A

four other bands, depending on
one’s definition of “band."

INTENSITIES IN TEN CITIES
Ted Nugent
Epic Records

Ted ’Loincloth’ Nugent strikes an
all-time low on this one. ’The Nuge'
has been rehashing and recycling his
own material for the last four
albums under the guise of a new
album release every nine months or
so. His album sales have been stead-
ily decreasing (rightfully so) as Ted
seems content in developing only his
clever song titles and lyrics (every
body wants to be a comedian) rather
than his musicianship or songwrit-

' ing abilities.

FERENT cities (including Pitts-
burgh). The problem lies in the fact
that Ted refuses to grow up, along
with his FORMER audiences. This
is a man who listens primarily to
tapes of HIMSELF in his off hours.
The effects of this are obvious; an
immediate shut-off of new ideas and
influences.

After listening to the album and
developing a strong case of Deja vu,
the only song I find partially-
stimulating is “Heads’WiIl Roll." At
one time, I found Nugent to be excit-
ing and lots of fun; now he only
insults my intelligence. But if you
like your rock music painfully loud
and songs like“Put Up Or Shut Up”,
“My Love is Like a Tire Iron" and
The Flying Lip Lock" sound intel-
Iectually stimulating, then this
album may be for you.

THE TEARDROP EXPLODES \
Kilimaniaro
Mercury Records

Of late, certain English rock crit-
ics have claimed that there is a revi-
val of psychedelic rock underway.
They‘ve been claiming this for
awhile so they’re open to doubt.

One of the bands they point to is
the Teardrop Explodes. However, if
this is psychedelia, then Jim Morri-
son is rolling in his purported grave.

Actually, The Teard rop...is a_ revi-
val of Ye Olde English Art Rock
Band. They have catchy melodies
and elaborate arrangements married
to punk drive.

Among other things, they use a
horn section in an intelligent way
outside an R&B context. lt’s used to
add “push" to the songs, for exam-
ple, “Ha, Ha I'm Drowning"instead
of muddying up the arrangement.

What makes one suspicious
though, are cuts like “Thief Of Bagh
dad,“ a slow, atmospheric number
that could have been done by
Renaissance of Yes if they were
starting out as I9 or 20 years old
now. This makes you wonder if The

Teardrop...will end up being the

next Kansas in three years. I hope .

not; they’re capable of better things.

PARADISE THEATRE
Styx
A&M Records

Once upon a time, there was this
band from Chicago. They called
themselves Styx. In a creative binge
that saw the release of six albums
prior to 1978, the band carved itself
a small, but sturdy niche with its
innovative use of several splintered
elements. Electronics were a "key-
note. The band specialized in pro-
gressive harmonies done an equally
progressive instruments, setting the
stage for the band’s highly complex,
tec-hno-art-rockish leads. The lyrics
too, if a bit ambitious, helped gain
Styx its small, but fiercely loyal
following. 1

That was once upon a time. A
album or two later, after Tommy
Shaw‘s aesthetic claws had sunk in,
the band groped for a bigger
audience. It started with Grand llu-
sion, but didn't hit with full-force
until Pieces of Eight, when the band
started in on a
mediocrity-.

With Paradise Theatre, the trend
continues. Styx seems to have taken
aim at the fourteen-year-olds with
the bottomless allowances. There is
simply too much emphasis on the
ballad; and as such, the shallowness.
shines. Instead of reaching for that
original sound, Styx has relegated
itself to a disco-syncopated beat; a
beat archaic these days, and down-

right blasphernous for Styx in the‘

first place.

Styx’s lyrics used to be introspec-
tive examinations of existence, if a
bit pretentious.

The pretentions were better. I
Where in earlier years, the lyrics
were contemplative, on Paradise
Theatre they are noticably absent.
Styx managesto sing about‘abso-
lutely nothing for 35 minutes. But
shallowness sells.

at different angles. flexing and dis-
playing their best body parts.

‘‘It‘s like a ballet or an art show.
You have to look like a perfectly

Hawk said.

“When I was on stage at the Teen-
age Pittsburgh Contest the audience
really gave me a lot of support." he
added. “They were shouting and
screaming, and I felt great. Perform-
ing builds up my ego and makes it all
worth it.“

Hawk admitted that aftera show.
girls enjoy ﬂocking around to touch
his arms and sneak a few pinches,
but he really doesn’t mind.

His girlfriend doesn‘t seem to
mind either.

“My girlfriend and my family are
very supportive of me," he said.
“They love what l’m doing, and they
offer a lot of encouragement. My
girlfriend's a bodybuilder, too, so
she really understands what it means
to me. Right now we’re working
towards performing together in our_
first couples competition next year.

thinks women’s bodybuilding is
great as long as, like the men body-
builders. they go about it the right
way. ’

“Women bodybuilders look ter-

rific because they’re firm, strong and
in shape. but some go too far. Men

_and women bodybuilders should be

able to look natural when they‘re not

make their bodies unnaturally

in addition to spending 24 hours a
week working out and I5 hours in
classes. Hawk finds time to work as
a bouncer at an Oakland bar and to
play drums in a band.

“During midterms and finals it
really gets rough to work. study and
be psychologically up for training. I
found out last year howimportant it
is to be ready in your mind as well as

Last year. Hawk entered nine

Bodybuilders Association Contest,
placing second in all of them.

“Last year l did really well in all

believe I could. Now l’m working to

“After l’m done with teenage

“As a professional. l might work

LL Ever taste a beer with no "hop" to it?

An impossible question?
No.The answer is, the beer on the right tasted better. The suds are
the tipoff. The head lacing the glass on the right has what brewers
call "cling? Its tendency to cling to the glass tells 1,7 ‘ -

Hops give a beer its zing. Too little hops
leaves a beer lifeless.Too much hops
makes a beer bite. 
But choose a beer with -the right i
proportion of hops to barley malt,and — 
your beer will be lively and refreshing. '
Yet, still go down nice and smooth.

Does your beer have “cling?"

To check for "cling? -you need a glass that's "beer clean? (Never used
for milk or soft drinks, never washed in soap?)

Pour your beer down the center of the glass to form a 3/4 inch
head. See if it leaves rings. of foam as you drink. But don't stop at the
"cling" test. Make this a fulI—ﬂedged taste test.

‘Note: "Beer-clean" glasses should be washed with detergent. Rinse several times in very hot
water. Air dry onIy—-never use a towel.

Can you recognize your beer by the taste?
Probably just 1 beer drinker in 3 can pick his beer
out of a group of three.You try. Pour your brand and
two other leading beers-—a Schlitz, Bud or a Miller-
into identical glasses. Have a friend switch them
around.As you drink each beer, not only check it for
its "cling? but rate its taste characteristics from 1 to 10
on the flavor scale. Now comes the real test.

Tell your friend which beer is yours.

Which beer tasted better?

3 _u\

 

Did your ehoice surprise you? .

Something like 2 out of 3 beer drinkers don't pick their brand.
And that surprises them.A lot of them"pick Schlitz instead. ,
That doesn't surprise us.Two years ago a master brewer. Frank

Sellinger, came to Schlitz.Today he is the Chief Executive Officer
and today's Schlitz is the smoothest beer he's ever brewed. Taste it
against yours.The results may surprise you.

L ooking At A
  L ast Term

The recent warm spells mark the advent of another term
careening to a close. For a newspaper. it is hard not to notice ~
the turmoil that took place in our busy calendar year that .
runs from September to May.

The last few cold months have been marked by some cold
events. This climate makes for always interesting news, but
there is something disheartening about always reporting
fast- or slow-breaking adverse developments.

Closest to us, and perhaps the most frustrating, are the
implementation of future budget cuts and tuition increases. -
There_has been much said, written and cursed on these
topics, but it has become increasingly difficult to see light at
the end of these matters. Departments are going to suffer
and the students will be paying more money for what may
be, to some, services of limited efficiency. So the cost of
academics goes up, and the cost of maintaining these aca-
demics will have to go down. A Pitt student becomes some-
one who feels that he/she is being pulled apart as he/she
watches fiscal factors speeding rapidly away from each
other.

Maybe there is some degree of over—reaction‘to these
matters, but the fact remains that when it comes to tighten-
ing belts, the Pitt student feels that he has been adding new
notches with the passage of each term.

These monetary concerns are coupledgwith those on a
much higher level: President Reagan‘s budget slashing. The
moment it becomes harder to pay for the less we are being
offered, the harder it becomesto get others to pay for these
same things. Federal education monies will become dismally
difficult to obtain with Reagan‘s proposed reductions, and
suddenly life for a student is not “who will win in the end
from all this,” but “who-will lose the least.”

These last'cold months with these more direct concerns
have been nurtured in another frightening atmosphere. Fis-
cal worries seem almost minimal as winter has left us locked
in a more cohesive national atti_tude. This attitude, unfortu-
nately, is one that has been precipitated by violence. We have
Dooled en masse for the death of.lohn Lennon, forthe death --
of El Salvadoreans, for the death of Atlanta chi-ldren and for
the near-death of a president and his men around him. We
watch precarious nations with our own precarious foreign
policies and, as the news come from Poland. we can take no
acton greater than holding our breath. It is a tighter nation
we are living in as the weather warms. but the reasons for this
union are not what anyone might call encouraging.

So as this term comes to a close. there is much t’o’keep on
one‘s mind in regards to the future, in the tiny circle of Pitt
and the larger scope that contains it. It is our hope that
future good news consists of something more thanjust the
weather reports.

Kirkpatrick Choice ‘Insult’ To Students

Dear Editor,

The University administration
has announced the choice of Jeane
Kirkpatrick, President Reagan's
appointee as U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations, as commence-
ment speaker for thisyear’s graduat-
ing class. For a university that prides
itself on its service to the community
and the world, there are a number of
reasons why this choice is ill-

advised.

Kirkpatrick met March I5 at the

U.N. with head of South Africa’s‘

military intelligence service, General

P.W. Van der Westhuizen, and a_

delegation accompanying him. The
U.N. arms “embargo on South
Africa, which our government is a
party to, prohibits military involve-
ment with the government of South
Africa; the meeting was therefore a
clear violation of long standing U.S.
policy and a signal of support for
South Africa’sapartheid system.

The Congressional Black Caucus,
describing the meeting as “a slap in

of Kirkpatrick. Rep. William Gray

(D-Pa.), speaking for the Black Cau-

nation that she did not know with
whom she was meeting “is a testim-
ony to either her naivete or lack of
credibility...To choose apartheid is
to alienate all of Black Africa."

Four Roman Catholic relief
workers from the U.S. were mur-
dered in El Salvador last-December;

involvement in this murder of the

porting. ln tandem with General
Haig’s cynical explanation that the
women “may have tried to run a
roadblock” (which fails to explain

why they were also raped and muti- ‘

lated), Ambassador Kirkpatrick has
stated that “the nuns were gnotjust
nuns..(they) were also politica acti-
vists.” The inference is clear: if it is
not exactly OK to kill nuns, it is OK
to kill political activists. ‘

The Somoza dictatorship in Nica-
ragua managed through its corrup-
tion and violence to ally every major
sector of the country, from the busi-
ness community to the Marxist left,
against it. Ambassador Kirkpatrick,
in an article in the January issue of
Commentary magazine, speaks of
this regime as “moderately compe-
tent...moderately oppressive and
moderately corrupt.” The inference
here is also clear: the U.S. should
have supported the Somozas and
should continue to support regimes
like theirs in Latin America.

The invitation of Kirkpatrick is an
insult to the faculty and students of
the University of Pittsburgh (who
had absolutely no say in this choice),
to 'tht2/black and Roman Catholic
communities of Western Pennsylva-
nia and to the graduating seniors,
whose work is to be honored at com-
mencement.

Q. “Is it possible to eat nutritiously
with so many fast food restaurants
around? " ’

A. Fast foods are readily available
and cheap! But, are they nutritious?
Yes, as part of a balanced diet.

The average fast food meal is a
cheeseburger, fries, a milkshake and
an apple pie. This meal is high in
calories, sugar, salt and fat. But it is
high in protein, and it could contain
adequate amounts ofthe B vitamins,
as well as vitamins C and D.

If you are watching your weight,
you have to be careful. A typical fast
food meal is approximately l,l8O
calories, over halfthe daily calories a
woman needs to maintain her weight
and over one-third the calories
needed by a man

Fast foods are an unavoidable
part of many American diets. So

how can excessive sugar, salt and fat
be avoided and all the necessary nut-
rients be obtained?

A chocolate shake is about 360
calories and may not be made from
milk. Instead, order an unsweetened
beverage, such as orange juice or
milk. An order of fries is over 200
calories; order saltless fries ‘or none
at all. An apple pie can be about 300
calories, so skip dessert or bring
along an apple.

A hamburger is approximately
260 calories. Many people remove
half of the bun before eating it. Be

But, you and l probably also know
of those taking advantage ofthe var-

’ ious social programs and trying to

get as much from the government as
possible.

I think that the government has
overextended itself in the past by
getting involved in all aspects ofpeo-
ples‘ lives. This cradle-to-grave type
of socialism has to be minimized.

eat only single portions. Take
advantage of salad bars, but watch
the condiments and dressings.

Fast foods have none or little of
some necessary vitamins and miner-
als. When eating in a fast food res-
taurant, make sure the rest of your
meals include: milk for its Vitamin
D, calcium and riboflavin; green
leafy vegetables for Vitamins A and
E, and fruit for Vitamin C, folic acid,
iron and fiber.

Eat a variety of foods in modera-
tion, then fast foods can be a part of
a balanced diet.

Pantherettes Seek Rep

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Sports Writer

Sometimes it's not so bad for the
girls to have a reputation—when it
comes to gymnastics.

The Pitt Pantherette gymnastics
team enters this weekend's AIAW
National Championships hoping to
build up its prestige in competition
against the top teams and individual
performers in the country. The meet
gets underway Friday with the team
and individual all-around cham-
pionships and ends Saturday with
the individual events finals.

Not that the Pantherettes' reputa-
tion is that bad now. The Pitt team is
currently ranked llth in the nation,
and Pitt coach Donna Sanft said one
of the Pantherettes' goals this wee-
kend will be to move into the top I0
with a good performance.

“It helps when the judges know
you're higher ranked, even though
they're supposeds to be objective.
We're entering the meet largely as an
unknown, despite our high rank-
ings, since we don’t compete against
the West," Sanft said. “But if we hit,
we're hoping to surprise some peo-
ple, and we should get fair scores."

Sanft agreed that Pitt's seeding
also helps because it places them in
the middle ﬂight of teams, which
competes second, instead of the bot-
tom ﬂight, composed of the teams
seeded l3th through 16th. Judges
are notorious for starting out com-
petitions with low scores and then
building them up as the better teams
compete. Of course, the higher
scores are largely because the better
teams are performing, but the initial
tendency toward low scoring leaves
the judges more freedom later in the
meet.

The Pantherettes expect to go
with the same lineup they entered in

Pitt gymnastics coach Frank
D’Amico and his three-man con-
tingent who qualified for Nationals
were greeted with a surprise upon
their arrival at the University of
Nebraska last week for the NCAA
National Championships.

No, it wasn't the hotel room, they
knew they were at the right college,
and it was the right weekend for the
competition. The surprise was some-
thing worse. From behind a cloud of
secrecy or confusion, out leaped an
NCAA ofﬁcal with an announce-

_ment that came as a surprise for
many of the coaches of the individ-
ual performers. All specialists would
be required to perform the Olympic
optional exercises as a preliminary
for the final competition.

“I couldn't bel_ieve it,” said.

D’Amico. “Our Eastern (NCAA)
chairman should have made us
aware of the requirement, but we
weren't informed of it untilwe got
= practiced the rou-
 " is ' ' "rd

. the

Easterns unless Roxanne Evans can-
not compete. Evans dislocated the
big toe on her left foot last week and
has not practiced tumbling since
then. Gretchen Speich, an alternate
at Easterns, will compete in the all-
around for Evans ifthe injury keeps
herout of action.

“Gretchen is an all-purpose gym-
nast. She can compete as a specialist
or in the all-around," Sanft said.
“She's very strong for an alternate.

Pitt's best individual hope is fresh-
man sensation Lisa Shirk, who will
compete in the all-around. Shirk is
currently ranked ninth in the nation,
but she was ranked first earlierin the
season before suffering a shoulder
injury. According to Sanft, Shirk
has a legitimate shot to win the indi-
vidual all-around.

“On a good day, Lisa Shirk could
be a contender for the national title,"
Sanft said. “I would say she has an
excellent chance of placing within
the top five, at least."

Shirk is coming off a good perfor-
mance at Easterns, where she nar-
rowly missed winning the all-around
title despite an assortment of injuries
and illnesses, diagnosed as a mild
case of mononucleosis. But Shirk
said Monday she is feeling better,
thanks to the two-week break from
competition since Easterns. She
added that her shoulder and ankle
injuries * that bothered her before
have improved.

In addition to Shirk, Karen Mar-
tin and Holly Martino, Pitt's two
other All-East performers, are
expected to do well at Nationals.
Sanft said Martino and Martin both
have a good chance of reaching the
finals in the vault. It will probably
take a 9.2 score or betterto reach the

Nationals. It made it tougher for
us." , '

And so D’Amico and his three
gymnasts-—Bes'ong, Dave Smith
and Frank Kratz—were forced to
hold a hurry-up review session
about the optional routines.

. “There were ‘five or six. of the
members ofzthe United States Olym-
pic team competing in the meet, guys

' who have been honing these routines

for two or_,three years,'_’ D’Amico
said. “The routines involve ballet
and real precise movements. They're

not very difficult to perform but, of V V

course, it helps to train for them.”

D’Amico tried to downplay the
surprise as far as its effect on the
gymnasts were concerned. All three,
however, turned in scores below
their season averages.

in the floor exercise, ‘Besong
ended with an 8.95, and Smith
scored a 9.15 to barely. miss his sea-
son average of 9.18.‘ Besong entered
the meet with a 9.25 averageand was
hoping to score even higher. All
three gymnasts added moves with
greater difficulty for the competition
in an effort to get higher scores.

Kratz missed his season average

by the greatest margin as he scored
an 8.95 .in the vault at Nationals. He

added that both gymnastscapable of
scoringthat high.

Martino and Regina Carson

should -rank high in the balance.

beam competition, said sanft, who
added that Carson also has a good
chance for the finals in the floor
exercise, along with Lori Miller.

The final team standings should
finish according to seeding, as they
usually do, said Sanft.

The top four seeded teams going
into the meet are Utah, Oregon
State, UCLA and Penn State. Sanft
said Penn State has an excellent
chance of moving up in the rankings
because ‘of the nature of the
competition.

“Penn State usually hits in the big
meets," Sanft said. “They also had
the advantage coming into the meet
as «the defending national cham-
pions, and they have won the title
three of the last four years."

Penn State boasts one of the best
individual performers in the coun-
try, freshman Heidi Anderso, who
dazzled the crowd at Easterns en
route to her all-around title. Ander-
son is currently tied with UCLA's
Sharon Shapiro for the No. 1 rank-
ing in the nation and has an excellent
shot at the national title. But expect
,Shirk to be right in the thick of
things, too. i

The Pitt team, besides trying to
rise into the top l0 in the standings,
will also be trying to crack the l43-
"point barrier in scoring, which
would be a team record. The Pan-
therettes set: a Pitt‘ scoring record
with a 142.45, but that score was

stunted because three girls fell off

the balance beam. ,

Surprise

affected‘ ‘us more than anything

else," D’Amico said. “But hopefully, '

next year'when we get there, we'll
know what to expect. We'd like to

go back next year -and bring back -

some hardware."

As expected, the meet was domi-
nated by
members. Jim Hartung of Nebraska
edged Bart Conner of "Oklahoma for
the individual all-around title. Har-

tungs's winning marginwas just five,-” ,

hundredths of a point.

In the team competition,
Nebraska, a traditional national
power, finished in first place, fol-
lowed by Oklahoma in second. The
results mirrored the two teams’ seed-
ing‘ order .coming into the meet.
UCLA‘ finished in third place.

_ D’Amico now turns his attention

lto recruiting for nextyear, when all

three of his national qualiﬁers will
return along with a strong.team
from this year. The coach said he‘
hopes to bring in five or six gym-

nasts recruitsthis year. The Pitt

team will lose only two performers

The Pitt Panther spikers spent
their past weekend in Fairfax, Virgi-
nia rewriting the history books of
Pitt men’s volleyball. A number of‘
precedents were set by the team over
two days at George Mason
University.

Pitt was victorious in its best—of—
five match with George Mason on
Friday evening and then followed
with a very successful day at the

men, ranging in age from 25-30, who
sport a great deal of experience.

The Panthers were defeated ear-
lier in the day by the same Maryland
squad in pool play, before turning
the tables and winning when it
counted the most, in the semi final
match.

Still another mark in the Pitt his-
tory books was the Panthers’ match
outcomes with rival George Mason.
Pitt initially defeated Mason on Fri-
day evening by scores of I2-I5, I5-9,

6-I5, I5-I3 and I6-I4, making the
Panthers tournament victors.

It was the third time that the two
teams had met and the third time
that the Panthers had decisively
defeated their opponent.

Panther Dave Mitas best summed
up the long weekend, iniwhich Pi_tt
saw a total of 23 games.

“How many times can you expect
to beat George Mason,” asked
Mitas‘? “We did it three times in less

‘than 24 hours. I call that a really

George Mason. Knuth continued to

finish.

By winning the tournament, the
Panthers have now been top finisher
in two consecutive invitationals. Pitt
had recently won their first tourna-
mentever when they captured the
Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League Open first-place trophy.

On their way to winning the title,
Pitt defeated the ‘Maryland Open
team for the first time in the Panth-
er‘s history. Maryland entered an

noon and Pitt took the match 7-I5,

place in the pool competition.
George Mason drew a bye into the
playoff round, enabling Pitt to face

finale of the weekend.

Ironically all three George Mason

contests opened up with the Panth-‘

game. Pitt lost those three openers

“It was a typical match each time
that we faced them,” said Reilly.
“They always come out fired up the
first game and play their hearts out
and beat us. Then we turn around
and win the rest of the games with-
out much trouble. I think that they
have a lot of trouble dealing with the
complexity of our offense.”

Pitt seems to put ajinx on George
Mason each time the two compete.
This was the fifth time that Pitt has
beaten the team from Virginia this
season.

The Panthers were not without
their problems over the weekend.
The team found out that starter
Brian Devine has mononucleosis
and was advised to take it easy
throughout the wekend. Then, in the
second match of the tournament
against East Stroudsburg, standout
spiker Bill Knuth was injured when a
ball stoved all four fingers on his
right hand, which prohibited his
strong hitting. Both saw decreased
action on Saturday.

Devine sat out a number ofgames
throughout the day and Knuth
missed two matches before being
given the nod to return to play.

for East Stroudsburg hit the ball

gers. I was happy, though, that our
trainer Sue (Whitney) saw fit for me
to go back after missing two
matches. I wasn’t able to hit as
much, but everyone kept faking to
me and using me as the decoy, which
worked out quite well.

Pitt substituted extensively dur-
ing the tournament. Coming off the
bench were Mitas, Mike Petock, Jim
Grant, and Barry Goldberg, who
were all outstanding. Petock went
into the semifinal game against
Maryland to replace a tired Danny
O’Donnell and then continued to
start each game of the final match
against Mason.

Reilly. “Jim Grant in the backcourt
played great on defense and helped

well. and Scott Robbins and Gary

As Whaley Sees It

By Jonathan Whaley

 

Baseball l98l. You know the old saying, when spring
comes a young man's thoughts turn to baseball or is it

_ something else. Well. the l98l baseball season begins today

and it’s time for that annual rite of spring, analyzing the

, teams for this year. Before doing that however, a comment

on a controversial trade that almost happened involving the
Pirates and the Yankees.

In that deal, the Pirates would have sent 26-year-old,
Jason Thompson (who they acquired from the California
Angels for catcher Ed Ott and pitcher Mickey Mahler)_ for

33-year-old left-handed hiting Jim Spencer. Thompsoii bat- ,

ted .290 last season with 2| home runs and 90 RBI while
Spencer hit .236 last year and hit l3 home runs and drove in
43 runs. That alone is enough to say, there is no way the
Pirates would give up a younger man, better average hitter,
who has more power, and could be first baseman of the
future.The Pirates tried to do exactly that. Even though
Spencer has over Thompson a better glove at first base.

The Commissioner of Baseball. Bowie Kuhn, stepped into

‘HAW

rhé Piti News. Wednesr1a_v. A pri/8, 1931

the proceedings, thankfully, after it was found out there was
some “shaky“ thinks going on. in essence the Pirates knew
Thompson was better than Spencer. but, they wanted cash at
the expense of giving away a quality player to help the team.
In addition to Spencer, the yankees were going to give

Pittsburgh $400,000 in cash, 2 essentially worthless minor a

league pitchers and, believe it or not. take Kurt Bevacqua
from the Pirates. cut him from their roster and pay off his 2
year contract estimated at $200,000 AN D this takes the cake.
pay $l50,000 a year for the three years remaining on
Spencer's contract. The total cash value ofthe deal is worth
$l.l5 million. I

A it was a shrewd attempt at circumventing the Commis-
sioner's cash ceiling on player transactions. The Commis-
sioner told the two clubs to re—work the deal, but both parties
could not agree, and the deal is off. This is one time Bowie
Kuhn made a strong and correct decision. Money at the
expense of a quality team is a bad thing for baseball. The
Pirates should not become the Minnesota Twins of the
National League.

Now for the predictions of this year’s divisional races.‘
NATIONAL LEAGUE WEST: Look for the Cincin-
nati Reds to finish on top. Last year the Reds endured
serious injuries to a number of key players and still only

Last year it too‘: the Houston Astros l63 games to win
neir first ever dlVlE.l0l"l title. They did it with pitching and
it -fense. They will have to do it again with the same ingre-

A dicnts because they were not able to acquire any power going

into the season. The Astros have quality players like left
fielder .lose Cruz and first baseman-center fielder Cesar
Cedeno. Their pitching, when it is right, is awesome. How-
ever,. their,lack of power and the loss of last year’s catalyst
Joe Morgan should i _3 them a notch into a close second to
Cincinnati. And don . forget that the Astros premier pitcher.
J.R. Richard, who is coming off a stroke.

The los Angeles Dodgers havethe same starting lineup
heading into this year as in the past few. They must believe
they get better with age. Last season they came on to tie
Houston and force a one gameplayoff. They lost the playoff
and came in second. This year they will fall to third. Steve
Garvey, Dusty Baker, and Reggie Smith will produce. The
pitching staff must shake off the loss of consistent winner
Don Sutton to Houston as a freeagent. The Big Blue Wreck-
ing Crew will stay in the race but, they will not win it this

year.

The Atlanta Braves willbe much improved this year, but,
in the tough Western Division, it may not show in the won
and lost column. The Braves can score runs but, stopping the
other team’s output is a difficult task at times.

Chambliss is a steady perormer. Until they improve their
pitching and defense. the Braves must be content with out-
scoring some teams at times and ﬁnishing fourth in the West.
But, they will be an entertaining team to watch.

Frank Robinson is the new manager of the San Francisco
Giants and he takes over a team that faded miserably in
September. New Brighton, PA’s jack Clark provided the
clout and good defense in right field. They picked up Enos
Cabell from Houston to fill the void at third base and he
should help. The Giant pitching is around the middle of the
pack in the National League. lfthe Giants’ hitting improves
and the starters have good years, the Giants could challenge
for third place.

The basement is all reserved for the San Diego Padres.
There will be alot of new faces on the field for the Padres.
They have speed but lack power. Keep your eyes out for
players like left fielder Gene Richards, third baseman-
outfielder Luis Salazer and newly acquired catcher Terry
Kennedy. The pitching is fair but, needs improvement; The
Padres will try to improve on last year’s 72 wins, but it will

, not be easy. .

NATIONAL LEAGUE EAST: For the past 2 sea-
sons, the Montreal Expos have gone down to the final 1
weekend and come up short both times, losing to the even-
tual world champions. The third time ‘should belong to
them. The Expos have good starting pitchers, men who can
swing the bat, and quality defense. Any team would like to
have catchers Gary Carter, center fielder Andre Dawaon,
and pitcher Bill Gullickson, to name just a few of their stars.
Stopping them this year could be like fighting a bear with a
‘switch. \

Pittsburgh Pirates stumbled from first place on August 17
to third at season’s end. Nobody suffered more injuries to
key personnel than Pitsburgh. When healthy, they can beat
anyone. They can hit-—left fielders Mike Easler and Lee

Lacy are good examples. If it‘s ﬁelding and hitting, third

The Pitt tennis tea .t upped its
record to 3-3 with 9-01 niliation of
St. Vincent's College. " .2 Panthers

only lost one set on way theirthird
win in a row. _

Pitt was led by Sci:-or Doug
White. who took the No. i singles
with a 6-! . 6-4 score. Whit is record
now stands at 4-2. .

White was followed by Rip
Wagner, who thrashed St. Vin :ent‘s
Dave Silko 6-0. 6-3. Wagner has the
squad‘s best record at 5-l. Freshman
Mark Weinberg got into the act with
a 6—2,6-l win over Mike Cans.
Panther Tony ‘Calderone followed
up with a 6-0, l-6, 6-] win. Fresh-
man Jeff Brand and Senior Steve
Berkowitz rounded out the singles
with impressive straight set victories
of their own. 

‘The Pitt News, Wedr1esda_i‘. April 8, I981

The doubles proved just as succes-

ful for Pitt as they swept the three
matches. White and Wagnerteamed
fora 6-0,6-I victory, then teammates
Weinberg and Brand combined fora
6-3.6-4 win. The last doubles match
teamed Berkowitz and Al Sondoski
and they were victorious 7-5. 6-2.

“We are starting to hit the ball real
well and'we‘re being consistent."
Diffenbach said.

Diffenbach‘s team has its work
cut out for it in their next match.
when the panthers travel to Mor-
gantown today for a match with
West Virginia the strongest team in

the Eastern Eight." WVU is the de- \

fending league champion.

Diffenbach is well aware of the
Mountaineers capabilities.

“They have a very solid team with
a lot of depth. They play a massive
30 game schedule and every one of
their players is _on scholarship."

For the Panthers to win at Mor-
gontown, they have to play very ag-
gressively,_according to Diffenbach.
Although he hopes his Panthers will
win, Diffenbach said he would not
be surprised if the Mountaineers
win.
