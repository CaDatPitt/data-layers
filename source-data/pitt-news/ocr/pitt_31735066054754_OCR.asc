Worker cuts hand

Hal Turner
Editor In Chief

A Pitt maintenance worker’s
wrist was slashed twice
Wednesday when the Forbes
Quadrangle garage door he was
fixing caught his hand.

Tony Aubrecht, a sheet—metal
worker. at Pitt, was standing on a
stepladder adjusting an overhead
bolt when it popped out, Pitt
Police Capt. Tim Delaney said.

The door sprung up and
caught Aubrecht’s left hand,
which he’d been using to keep
his balance atop the ladder. _

Aubrecht’s hand got reeled
in, and his watch .cut two deep
lacerations-into his wrist.

The door rolls up like a
classroom map or a movie
screen. .

Aubrecht’s co-workers cut a
chain, allowing them to gently
lower the door and free his hand,

in garage door

Delaney said. They were fixing
the door of the Pitt grounds-crew
storage in the Forbes Quad park-
ing garage.

Officer Robert Kolesky, who
teaches CPR in the Pitt Police

Department, answered the call.

“He was alert, talkative,
[and] experiencing a great deal
of pain around his left wrist,”
Kolesky’s report read. Aubrecht
was trapped for nearly 10 min-
utes, and he lost a lot of blood.
The report noted that Aubrecht
could still move his fingers,
which indicated that no serious
damage was done.

Medics took him to

Presbyterian Hospital in Oakland .

at about 2:30 p.m.

Second District Fire Chief
Carl Schenck said that he
thought Aubrecht would be all
right and that Aubrecht was

lucky to have been freed so

quickly.

Black Action Society President Shavon
Ogunleye said she wants the organization’s
30th anniversary to be a good memory.

“I would like African-American students
to succeed and go on to the next level of life,
therefore becoming a positive attribute in our
communities as a whole,” Ogunleye said.

BAS is trying to get an African cultural
center at Pitt that would educate students
about their history. .

In the meantime, students can address
their problems, concerns and questions at the
BAS office in Room 627 of the William Pitt
Union.

“I want students to think of Black Action
Society as the ‘information station’ about the
black community on the Pitt campus,” said
BAS Vice President Esrick O. McCartha.

BAS’ first general body meeting Tuesday
concentrated on helping to unite Pitt’s

_ African-American students and Pittsburgh

residents with the new ofﬁcers of the society
and their responsibilities.

Political Action Chairman Markques
McKnight said his committee’s job is to be
assertive in addressing the injustices of stu-
dents on campus.’

“We need to educate ourselves to know
what we’re fighting for and what we’re ﬁght-
ing about,” said McKnight. .

Mykol Walters is the Black Action
Society’s Inter-Collegiate Struggle-chairman.
His job is to bring together organizations on
this campus and surrounding campuses.

“We must stop bastardizing ourselves
and become the facilitators and mothers of
our own culture, language and heritage,”
Walters said. “We need to stop being coun-
terproductive and become productive in our
community and in our individual lives.”

Community Outreach Chairwoman
Kynetta McFarlane is available to make sure
that students are productive in the communi-
ty. She said her duties are to unite the
University community with the Pittsburgh
community and to unite students with one
another. ' A

McFarlane said The B1ackLine — BAS’

 

network journal — is an aid to her because it-

keeps members posted on the volunteer
opportunities available. Kathleen Black, the
BlackLine’s chairwoman, said her duties are
to oversee the publication’s production and
manufacture.

“My job is to make sure that my -com-
rnittee and I do everything possible to ensure
that we all receive good grades, remain
enrolled at this institution, and graduate in a
timely manner,” said Academic Affairs
Chairman Mwiza Ushe. He added that he
plans to accomplish the goal by holding
weekly study sessions and monthly study-a-
thons.

“A lot of my friends are intimidated to go

to the learning center for any help because"

there aren’t any African-Americans there,”
offered freshman Kimberly Dillon .
McCartha said he “plans on making BAS
a C.U.T. above the rest.” The acronym stands
for Communication, Unity and Togethemess.

. He said that the three tools will be used to

move BAS in a positive direction.

Executive Assistant Sean K. Stallings is
responsible for making sure the chairpersons
stay on track as well. He has the task of com-
municating with all the committee chairs
concerning the production of their commit-
tees. .

“I have attended their first meeting to see
how /they operate, seewhat skills they may
lack or have as far as being in a leadership
position,” Stallings said.

For The Pltt News

Pitt alumna Lynn Snead worked in
sales for a few years after she graduat-
ed, but has since changed directions to
head a company that serves victims of
domestic Violence.

One of the best parts of the job is
that she is helping people, she said.

“I left the business and industry
world seven years ago. I made four
times my salary now. I would never go
back,” Snead said.

Snead sat on a 10—woman panel at
the second annual Internship Site
Reception in the Assembly Room of
the William Pitt Union Tuesday. The
program, sponsored by the women’s
studies program, was designed to help
Pitt students find internships in the
women’s service industry.

Snead is the president of the
Coalition Against
Domestic Violence, a 65—member
association dedicated to reducing
domestic violence by offeringservices
that support and empower victims
through‘ education and by providing a
crisis line.

PCADV has taken many Pitt
interns from the women’s studies pro-
gram in the past, and Snead said she is
eager to hear from prospective interns
in the future.

Theresa Orlando of the Miryam_’s
Day Treatment Shelter Program also
spoke of tolerance and interaction with
women. ' . ,

“Miryam is about women working
with women to empower women to

empower women,” Orlando said.
Many representatives gathered to
network and provide literature and
possible internships to Pitt students.
Marguerite Babcock, M.Ed., a
clinical supervisor at the Sojourner
House, was another panelist who

“I always tell women in the house
to walk like German Shepherds, not
poodles,” Babcock said.

This house is a faith-based resi-
dential rehabilitation facility where
addicted women learn ,to break the
cycle of poverty and chemical abuse,»

Carol McAllister of the Health’
Services Administration told attendees
about the Head Start Program. This
program was founded 30 years ago,
and the Early Head Start Program
began in 1995 to provide earlier edu-
cation programs for mothers of infants.

“Head Start is different from most
women’s programs in the sense that we
are not directly involved in the pro-
gramming. Rather, we are an evalua-
tion of the program,” McAllister said.

Known locally as Family
Foundations, the program currently
has sites at Terris Village in the Hill
District, McKees Rocks, and Clairton.

Head Start is looking for interns in
its research department. Holding up a
baby T—shirt with a parent and baby
bear, McAllister said, “We see the
children as part of our team experi-
ment.” '

Naomi Green, a Pitt student who
interned at Miryam this summer, said,
“It was an amazing opportunity in my
educational experience.”

Perrin coordinates the monthly general
body meetings.

Saturday, Sept. 19, 1998.
Oakland will be host to at least
60,000 rabid football fans. This
past week, Fifth Avenue has
played host to a team of con-
struction workers and equip-

‘ -ment.

What on earth is‘ the City
Council doing carving up one of
the biggest streets in the
Oakland area six days before
trafﬁc is likely to be at its armu-
al peak? .

Visiting Penn State fans,
along with Pitt fans and alumni,
will not want to negotiate atro-
ciously heavy traffic, a serrated
road and an avenue full of bright
orange signs, cones and barrels.

With this in mind, let us
hope that other contingencies are
planned and that everything else

_ goes swimmingly. If the roads

are in a state, let’s hope nothing

. else will go wrong Saturday.

Let’s hope that Oakland bars
don’t run out of beer this week-
end. We all know what happens
when Penn Staters don’t get
their liquor (remember the riot in
State College this past sum-'
mer?). If the taps run dry, Forbes
Avenue street lights will be fuel

for less festive bonﬁres than the .

one at tonight’s pep rally. '
Pitt Police will. obviously
have a strategy to deal with the

near-capacity crowd that is like-
ly to be at Pitt Stadium. Bubble
Boyl will have to be protected
from being pelted with bottles of
iced tea, and they’ll have to
clamp down on those yahoos
with the deer-head—on-a-stick
before neutral spectators realize
they’re Pitt students.

Tailgating, which will be
prevalent before and after the
Penn State game, will be closely
monitored. Whether Pitt wins or
loses, tailgate parties will have
to be watched for excessive
abuse of alcohol, persons over-
come by hysteria (whether in
sorrow or jOY), and those tempt-

ed to take out anger, frustration, '

or cheerful spirit on a lost and

‘wandering Penn State fan.

Oakland business owners,
some of whom have decried
Pitt’s decision to hold the
Backyard Brawl at Three Rivers
Stadium, will be having a ﬁeld
day. They’ll be hoping that noth-

ing goes wrong for the sake of’

their businesses.

- This Saturday, with the Pitt
vs. Penn State game as huge as it
is, it would be nice to have a
Fifth Avenue that’s smooth,
clear, and without construction.
No one wants to -celebrate a vic-
tory or sulk over a loss in a mas-
sive trafﬁc jam.

- Religion has always played a signiﬁcant
role in the lives of most Americans. It can
provide strength to the weak, comfort to the
grieving, and hope to those in despair.
Lately, religion has also become a signiﬁcant
player in political life; I believe that this is a
bad move for both American public policy
and for’ religion in America.

The inﬂuence of religion in politics is
easiest to note in the GOP. The Republican
Party, which once had Newt Gingrich as its
helrnsman, now caters to the religious right

' at the expense of the former core issues of

states’ rights and smaller government.
Political candidates hoping for a shot at the
Republican nomination in the next presiden-
tial election‘ must first pass -the Christian
Coalition’s litmus test.

The religious right’s reach hasn’t been a_
strictly partisan affair. It has used television
and print ads to shape public-policy debates
and campaign for ballot ini- ’
tiatives. These tactics, while  ARQLD
sometimes violating lobbying
laws, have been effective in

we are at least led to believe is

desirable for Christians.

So what is the problem? Religion and
politics are two very distinct schools of
thinking, and any attempt to merge these
ﬁelds _ will have to reconcile these differ-
ences. I don’t believe that can be done.

In any self-goveming nation, govern-
ment policies are going to undergo public

debate. This scrutiny is necessary and

healthy in a democracy. Critical thinking is
the very lifeblood of political discourse.
Assertions require argument and evidence
before becoming law, rather than self-right-
eous proclamations of truths.

Religion does not work on this principle,
but rather on the idea of faith. It is common-
ly said that proof of God would deny faith,‘
and indeed, no proof exists. A Christian

, Fundamentalist view of the Bible does not

open itself to debate. Once explained by our
benevolent leaders that a particular approach
to a public policy or civil rights issue is the
willofGod,thatmatt'erissettled. p

This religious approach to politics
would lead us into an Orwellian state of will-
fully suppressing critical thinking in favor of
the faith of a possible majority. The frighten-

  
   

Jones

ing ideas of Orwell’s “I984,” such as “dou
blespeak” (equal rights are special rights)

and “crimethink” (criticism of policy as.

heresy), could be a reality. It would not be
the first time that religion has been used to
control people. History is literally ﬁlled with
this abuse, from the pharaohs to the present
day. In fact, America should be proud that
we go against this norm and are one of the
few nations that still have a strong religious

presence without the trappings of a theocra— ~

cy. ,
While a theocracy is one possibility, the
entering of religion into the political arena
could have quite the opposite effect. If a
politician asserts that a given piece of legis-
lation is required by God or against God’s
will, that politician could ﬁnd God subject to
debate. At the very least, any interpretation
of the Bible would be criticized and debated.
Belief is not the same as knowledge, and the
strength of a conviction is not
FRANC}5 the same as evidence.

The Southern Baptist reli-
gion, which was founded
after a split with northern
Baptists over God’s approval
of slavery, has already found that its deeply
_held religious views will be scrutinized and
the very feasibility of its beliefs questioned
when public policy is concerned.
Pronouncements that are homophobic and

sexist have led to constant ‘assaults on the

beliefs of this small, vocal religion.

Simply put, religion’s increased involve-
ment in politics will require a resolution to
the conﬂict between the need for a critically
thinkingpolicy ﬁlled with open debate and a
religion that requires an adherence to asser-
tions made without proof.

If we are to continue to govern ourselves
rather than allow religion’s absence of criti-
cal thinking to dominate America, religion

,will have to face the constant thoughtful
attacks from those its policies hurt. This

would place religion in the impossible posi-2 ’
_ tion of demonstrating its correctness through

arguments and evidence, or cease to be rele-
vant in American life.

Harold Francis Jones wonders how long
Clinton would have endured had a scandal
bmken about a private sexual relationship
with a Mark Lewinsky.

THE. PIn' News: SPECIAL EDITION

Pitt vs. PSU 9

FNFL Panthers and Lions heacf to heacl__

Geoff Moak

Staff Wrlter

Why do people go to college?
For most of us, it has to do with
being able to get a better job.
Football players are no different;
they’re here at least in part because

they hope to get a job playing in A

the NFL. So an important measure
of a college football program’s
success is the quantity and quality
of players who land those coveted
NFL positions.

As a way to compare the two
programs, I’ve put together a ﬁc-
tional team of Pitt" alumni and
matched them up against Penn
State alumni, only considering
what these players did as profes-
sionals. Here’s how they compare:

Quarterbacks:

Let’s ignore Dan Marino for a
moment. That would leave Matt
Cavanaugh as Pitt’s best quarter-
back That’s not really good news

for Pitt fans, except that the best
ﬂiat Penn State has to offer is Todd
Blackledge. Sure, they both won
national championships in college,
but neither was a particularly good
pro player. Alex Van Pelt and
Kerry Collins would be the back-
ups, so we’re still pretty close to
evenly matched. Of course,
Marino is afuture hall-of-famer,
so Pitt wins this contest easily.

Running backs:

Any discussion of Pitt run-
ning backs has to start with hall—of-
farner Tony Dorsett. Pitt also has
Marshall Goldberg, who played in
the World War H era, when foot-
ball was not exactly foremost in

rmost people’s minds. Curtis

Martin would be an excellent
reserve on any team. Rounding
out the roster (in more ways than
one), we have Craig “Ironhead”
Heyward, who if nothing else, has
the best nickname on the team.
Penn State has not one, but

two hall—of—fame running backs --
Franco Harris and Lenny Moore.
After that, the talent level dmps 011“
a lot. Curt Warner is the next best
player. I would give Curtis Enis
the beneﬁt of the doubt and
include him in this discussion, but
Penn State also produced Ki-Jana
Carter, one of the worst No. 1 draft
picks in recent memory. That can-
cels out any potential Enis has.

The edge goes to Pitt on the
basis of depth.

Receivers: ..

Mike Ditka was not, techni-
cally, a receiver. But he did lead
the Panthers in receiving for three
years. Besides, Pitt hasn’t pro-
duced any real NFL receivers that
you’ve heard of.

Penn State hasn’t fared much

better. The best Nittany Lion J
-alumnus would ‘be O.J. McDuﬂie,

but let’s avoid talking about any
football players named OJ. and
call this match-up even.

Offensive line:

Offensive linemen don’t usu-
ally get noticed on an individual
basis. Such is the case with Penn
State’s linemen. Sean Farrell,
Steve VV1sniewski, and Tom
Rafferty, among others, have had
ﬁne NFL careers, but you’ve prob-
ably never heard of any of them.

Pitt has produced several
oﬁensive linemen you might
know. Mark May was a member
of the Washington Redskins’
“hogs” in the ‘80s. Bill Fralic, Jim

Covert and Ruben Brown were all -

ﬁrst-round picks in the NFL draft
and went on to become All-Pros.
Add two—time.Super Bowl cham-
pion Mark Stepnoski at center, and
this squadwillrunPenn Stateotf
the ﬁeld.

Defensive Line:

As good as Pitt’s offensive
line is, the Penn State defensive
line is equally formidable. Matt

Millen is only the tip of the ice-
berg. Penn State also . has
Roosevelt Grier, one of the most
feared linemen ever to play, and

NFL hall-of-famer Mike
Michalske.
Pitt is more than respectable at

this position too. Hugh Green and
Bill Maas are both two-time Pro
Bowl players, but in terms of pro
accomplishments, Penn State gets
the edge here.

Linebackers: ,
They don’t call Penn State

‘ “Linebacker U.” for nothing. The

best Penn State linebacker of all is
anarne farniliartofootballfans in
Pittsburgh: hall-of-farner Jack
Ham. Penn State also has Dave
Robinson, an All-Pro in the ‘60s,
and Shane Conlan, who played on
the Buffalo Bills’ Super Bowl
teams earlier in the ‘90s.

Pitt also has a hall-of-fame
linebacker in Joe Schmidt, a

‘ Former coach Johnny Majors speaks about the Pitt-PSU rivalry

Mario Machi

For The Pltt News

John Majors coached the Pitt Panthers
from 1973 to 1976 and from 1993 to 1996.
He was at the helm for some of the biggest
games in Panther football history. Who
wouldbeabetterpersontotalkaboutthe
upcoming game than the former coach?

‘Much of the buzz around this game is
actually left over from Saturday, when Penn
State coach Joe Patemo notched his 300th
career victory, which is tops among active
coaches. Majors said that Patemo’s achieve-
ment “was no surprise.”

“I know a lot of coaches who would
have loved to [have] been in his situation,”
Majors said, but he added, “A lot of people
could win at Penn State.”

He said that Patemo “came into the per-
fect situation.” “They had a built-in winner,
and he kept them going. I have a lot of

Q - ‘£9011 meetings are in JJ)-30 ‘CQ707°f.Q-‘ﬁ>// interested students are encouraged to attencil

 

respectfor that.”
Majors then talked about the rivalry

aspect of the Sat1mday’s game. He has been
involved in many big rivalries over the years,

from Texas vs. Arkansas to Alabama vs.

Termessee. Majors said that the game “must
be played on a regular basis.” He added that,
when played annually, the game is “as excit-
ing as any rivalry in college sports.” He said
that the game has a historical signiﬁcance,
since the two teams ﬁrst met in 1893.

Majors said that one of the reasons for
the excitement of the game is that the players
are familiar with .each other. He noted that
many of the players have known each other
ﬁom high school competition, as well as
from various all—star games.

Majors vividly remembers his games
against Penn State. In 1973, his ﬁrst year at
Pitt, he took  54-1 Panther squad into
Happy Valley to face the undefeated, top-
ranked Nittany Lions. Penn State was led by

eventual Heisman Trophy-winner John

Cappelletti.
Majors had a young freshman rtmning

back by the name of Tony Dorsett. At half- .

time, the Panthers looked like they were
ready to pull the upset. They held a 13-3 lead
at the break However, the Lions dominated
the second halfand won the game, 35-13.
The 1976 Pitt-Penn State game had the
teams in exactly the opposite situations. The
Panthers were undefeated It was their last
hurdle to an unbeaten regular season and a
Sugar Bowl berth The game was tied at 7 at
halftime. Majors decided to move star tail-
back Dorsett to the fullback position Dorsett
ended the game with 224 yards rushing and
two touchdowns to help the Panthers win by
a score of 24-7. '
Majors is very enthusiastic about the

future of Pitt athletics. He said that Pitt _

Athletics Director Steve Pederson is a “man
of intelligence, creativity, and imagination.

Dear Mr. Pederson:

Now that the fun and festivities of the Penn State weekend are upon us,

I we Pitt football fans would like to take a moment to reﬂect on last sea-

son’s nationally televised upset of Miami.

We would like to thank you for letting us, the happy mob of students, tear
down the goal post. That was exciting, to say the least. But a goal post
isn’t that big, and many of us were left without a spot to participate in the
age old ritual. Also, some of us were so exhausted by the time we ran
down to the other end that we barely had enough energy to rip the post
from the ground. . E '

Then 'there’s the issue of those gun-wielding ofﬁcers protecting the other
goalpost. They were hardly in a “How do ya do, congratulations on the
win” kind of mood.

In the event of a Pitt victory on Saturday, we humbly ask you to please let
us, the simple folkof this campus, have both goal posts.

I Miami was a huge win, but a win over Penn State would be even more

monumental because we hate them so much. Letting us take both goal
posts would really mean a lot to us, especially the few of us who stuck
with Pitt time and time again when things weren’t so good;

Letting us have both would build more pride and peak more fan interest.
Plus, it would look really cool on tape. We understand it would be expen-
sive, but if you want, we could try to prop it back up somehow after we’re
done parading it around. Thank you for your time, Mr. Pederson, and

‘l'IIuRsDAv, 17 SEPTEMBER 1998

please consider our request.

Yours truly,

mm

The Pitt Fans

PRos

Detroit Lion in the ‘50s and ‘60s. "Current
NFL. players Chris Doleman and Jerry
Olsavsky are Pitt alumni as well. It’s a solid
group of players, but not as good as Penn
State’s. '

FROM PAGE 9

Defensive Backs:

As slim as the choices were for
receivers, the people who will be covering
those receivers are even worse. Neither
school has produced anyone who deserves
to be mentioned in the same story with the
likes of Dorsett, Ham, and the rest. So we’ll
call this position even and move on.

Special Teams:
Kickers don’t come to tl1eNFL from
colleges. Lots of NFL kickers are guys who

. couldn’t make it as soccer players in other

parts of the world. The only kickers of note
from either of these schools are Matt and

Chris Bahr of Penn State. But it should be
said that guys like Ditka used to kick in addi-
tion to playing both oﬂense and defense, and
they did them all well. Having said that,
based on pro careers, the edge goes to Penn

' State.

' Coaches:

Joe Patemo has been at Penn State so
long that nobody associated with the Nittany
Lions has a chance of getting into the coach-
ing business. Pitt has produced its fair share
of NFL coaches. Having already used Mike
Ditka as a player, the head coach of this
team will be Pitt’s second best option, Marty
Schottenheimer, with,Dave Wannstedt as an
assistant That’s a whole lot more than Penn
State has to_ offer.

This would make an interesting game.
When it. comes to producing professional
football players, Penn State seems to have
the edge in quantity, but Pitt wins out in

. quality.

Penn State deﬁnitely has the advantage
on special teams, an area which almost cost
Pitt its ﬁrst game.

Overall, Penn State has an advantage in
almost all areas, but it could have a letdown
after Patemo’s 300th win. Also, never under-
estimate Walt Harris and his staff.

HISTORY

FROM PAGE 1

head coach. During his 15 years at Pitt,

Sutherland’s players faced Penn State 12
times. Twelve times, Pitt emerged victori-
ous.

Before his ﬁrst win over the Lions as a
coach, a 24-3 victory on Thanksgiving Day
in 1924 to close out the season, Sutherland
sequestered his players for a week in
Ligonier. '

“The Panthers retumed to Pittsburgh the
morning of the game,” according to one
report, “with a new spirit and determination
to do or die [in] their last contest.”

Sutherland’s ﬁnal victory against Penn
State was a 26-0 win in 1938. Pitt’s “Dream
Backﬁel ” (nmning backs Harold Stebbins,

Marshall Goldberg and Dick Cassiano; and

quarterback John Chickemeo —— considered

-by many to be the greatest oifensive back-

ﬁeld of all time) destroyed Penn State’s

defense. Cassiano himself scored three

touchdowns.

The 1940s marked a down-tum in Pitt
football, a decade in which the team ﬁnished
above .500 only twice. But it ‘went 6-4
agains' t Penn State in that time span. 1

‘There is always a feeling,” said former
Pitt quarterback Matt Cavanaugh (1974-
I977) in the early ‘90s, “that you’ve got to
beat Penn State, or your season is not com-
plete — no matter what your record is going

’ into the game — and I’m sure they feel the

sanre way.” ' .

The 1950s were an up—and—down
decade for Pitt, ,record—wise and against
Penn State. The team ﬁnished above .500
ﬁve times and below .500 ﬁvetimes, and it
went 4-5-1 against the Nittany Lions.

The 1957 match—up was the most excit-
ing meeting in the ‘50s, with the Panthers
winning 14-13 on a deciding extra point that
had to be kicked twice.

Norton Seaman, a guard for Pitt, con-
nected on his ﬁrst try, but Pitt was called off-
side. Seaman drilled the second attempt, giv-
ing Pitt the win and keeping Penn State out
of the Gator Bowl.

Football fans in the ‘60s, though, wit-
nessed what was probably the most unusual
Pitt vs. Penn State occurrence. In 1963, Pitt
was scheduled to face its in-state rivals on
Nov. 23. Heading into the contest with a 7-1
record, Pitt was looking for a win to secure
an invitation to the Orange Bowl against Big
Eight champion Nebraska

But because of John F. Kennedy’s

assassination on Nov. 22, the game was

postponed until Dec. 7. Orange Bowl oﬁi-
cials, not wanting to take the chance of Pitt
losing to Penn State after being chosen,
picked Auburn.

When Pitt ﬁnally did face the Lions,

He scored the winning touchdown on a 17-
yard roll-out to cap a thrilling 77-yard drive.

The result: a 9-1 team, ranked third in
the nation, in no bowl game at all.

Coach John Majors inherited a Pitt
team in 1973  was 1-10 the year before,
including a 49-27 thumping at the hands of
the Nits. VV1thin two years, Majors had
nursed the team back to respectability.

On Nov. 22, 1975, top-10 Penn State
visited Pitt Stadium, narrowly escaping with
a 7-6 victory. Not without a few scares from
Pitt kicker Carson Long, though.

“Carson Long was our kicker then, and
he missed two or three easy ﬁeld goals,” said
Rantle Stottlemyer, Pitt’s current head
wrestling coach and a Pitt student from 1973
to 1978. “I’m talking 20-some yards. Carson
Long was a jokester, and the rrmning joke
with him was he said the next day he ‘tried to

hang himself, but when he went to kick the.

stool out, he missed” .
The next season, though, Pitt ended

Penn State’s -10—game winning streak overfg
the Panthers, winning 24-7 at Happy Valley
‘en route to a national championship. Pitt um-

ning .back Tony Dorsett racked up 224 yards
in the game, his ﬁnal against the Nittany
Lions, ‘including 173 in the second half as a
fullback -— a surprise strategy drawn up by
Majors at halftime.
In Your Lifetime _ ’

The most exciting decade for the rival-

ry, though,Iwas the ‘80s.

In 1980, Carlton W1lliarnson’s garne-
saving interception in the fourth quarter pre-
served a 14-9 Panther win. Hugh Green,
Pitt’s All—America defensive end, called" it a
“double-Excedrin game.” V

“There was lots of pounding, lots” of
limping, and lots of headaches afterwards,”

he said. I

' Foge Fazio, a former Pitt player and
head coach, remembered the 1984 game.

“We were not having .a very good year.

On the very ﬁrst possession of the game, we

fumbled on our own 7, and our defense held I

them to a ﬁeld g ”i he said “We went on
towinthatgarne,31-11.” , .

rivalry’s most nerve-raclcing game was the

With 36 seconds left in the game.

On the next play, Pitt strong safety Billy

Saturday, a lot of Pitt fans will have big-

ger expectations for the Panthers than they.

did last season. Fans who just wanted Pitt to
cover the spread last year are now expecting
a close game or an upset victory. And if the

, Panthers pull it off, the fans may pull the two
' goalposts off the ﬁeld

More importantly, a ‘Pitt victory may
give’ therivalry new ﬁre. Considering the
two schools are only slated to play each
other twice more after this , season, ‘a
respectable showing by Pitt in these games
could strengthen the chance of a rivalry
renewal. , * » g ,

.“It' started up again at a perfect time,
with the new Panthers, new coach, new
teamj’ said Student Government Board
President Alyson Wallach, who -has attended
every Pitt-Penn State game since 1981. “I’m
hoping that the game is competitive enough
to-regain strength as a good rivalry.”

Athletics Director Steve Pederson
would also like to rekindle the rivalry and
keep it going.

“We may have to go through a little hia-
t11s"here because of their scheduling,” he
said, “but I’m inhopes that we can make a

‘ long-term deal that makes sense for every-

Young cats square off for 94th meeting since I893

. Patrick Robertson

Sports Edltor

Joe Patemo brings his Penn State
Nittany Lions into Pitt Stadium Saturday
fresh off the 300th win of his career.

Patemo beat Bowling Green 48-3 last
weekend. He has 24 morewins to go to beat
Bear Bryant’s record for career victories.

This will be the 94th game between Pitt
and Penn State, a series that dates back to
1893. The Nittany Lions lead the series 48-
41-4 all—time, with the last meeting at Pitt
Stadium played in 1991. .

Last year, the Panthers "traveled to
Happy Valley and lost to their cross-state
rivals, 34-17, although the young team took
a lot out of just a 17-point loss to the No. 1
team in the nation. ‘

This year, both teams have new looks
after losing many players on both sides of the
ball. '

The Nittany Lions lost one of their most
productive rtmning backs in recent history,
Curtis Enis, to the Chicago Bears in the NFL
draft after his junior year.

They also lost star receiver Joe
Jurevicius. . .

Last year’s starting quarterback, Mike
McQueary, also graduated and tried out in
the NFL but did not make any team’s roster.

On defense, linebacker Aaron 
and his brother, strong safety Jason Collins,
both graduated, along with outside line-
backer Jim Nelson.

Pitt lost just as many players, but the
losses had more impact on the Panthers

because they lack of depth. Starting quarter-
back Pete Gonzalez is now a Pittsburgh
Steeler; tailbacks Billy West and Dwayne
Schulters both graduated, with West taking a
job as an engineer at a Pittsburgh ﬁrm.

action.

Pitt’s linebackers hope to have a ﬁeld
day on the PSU nmriing attack, but that will
put the ball in the hands of the dangerous
quarterbacks.

The Lions’ offensive line boasts three
seniors in Eric Cole, Ryan Fagan and Floyd
Wedderbum, to complement sophomores
Jordan Caruso and Kareem McKenzie. All
of the starters weigh more than 295 pounds,
which could cause ‘the Panthers a lot of
headaches — and all other kinds of aches,
for that matter.

Of the four receivers onthe depth chart,
three are seniors: Corey Jones, Joe Nastasi
and Chaﬁe Fields. They will be joined by
Bruce Branch to catch the passes from
PSU’s quarterbacks. . T

The Panthers look to be stronger on the
defensive side of the ball than on offense.
The line has some experience in jtmior Ken
Kashubara, ﬁfth-year senior Kenny Pegrarn,
junior Demond Gibson and ﬁfth-year senior
Marlin Young.

Phil Clarke, Nick Cole and Karim
Thompson start at the linebacker positions
for the Panthers, but freshman Arnir Purifoy
will make a big impact.

Hank Poteat and Tray Crayton will
work the comers for the Panthers, with
Chiffon Allen and Chuck Brown backing
them up. DJ. Dinkins is the free safety and
looks to make an impression with some big
hits, while Seth Homack will be the strong
safety after a solid performance on Sept 5.

The Nittany Lion defensive line has

Preview, page 10

Formerancl current Pitt players reveal their feelings about Penn State

Brian Knavish

Assistant Sports Edltor

Pitt. players, current and former, offer
their views on Penn State as follows:

, ‘Jerry Olsavsky, former Pitt and Steelers

linebacker, played for the Panthers from

1985 to 1988, and hefosters some strong

dislike for the Nittany Lions. 8

“We had big games with Notre Dame
and Miami, but we always looked forward to
Penn State. I just don’t like them. There are
no ‘ifs,’ ‘ands,’ or ‘buts’ about it.”

' Olsavsky also told the story of when the
Steelers played the Bears in Chicago a cou-
ple years ago, and a Steelers fan asked him
for an autograph after the game. But
Olsavsky refused imtil the man removed the
Penn State shirt he was wearing.
°Steve Israel, former Pitt and cunent New
England Patriots comerback, played for the
Panthers in the early 1990’s. He feels’ the

rivalry was a step up from a “friendly rival- 1

ry.

“Something like Pitt-Syracuse is a
ﬁiendly rivalry. Pitt-Perm State is not ﬁiend-
ly,” he explained. ‘‘There’s no doubt our
teamsdidnotlikeeachotheratalland
sometimes we didn’t even respect each
other. Sometimes the games got dirty.

“I got recniited by Penn State,” he said,

“but to tell you the truth, I didn’t even open
their mail. Why would I want to go there? I

- knew I wanted to be a Pitt Panﬂier, so once
they recruited me, it really wasn’t much of a ‘

question.” ,

-Jim Sweeny, former Pitt and current
Steelers oﬁensive lineman, remembers the
backyard feel of the rivalry. 7

“It was abig rivalry because there was a
lot of emotion because guys you played with
or against in high school were on the other
side of the ball,” explained Sweeny.

“I played with [current Duquesne
University head coach] Greg Gatuso in high
school, then against him when he was at
Penn State. He was their starting nose tackle,
and I was the starting center. You can’t get
much closer than that” , ‘
-Ben Kopp, current Pitt tight end, was
recruited and olfered a scholarship by Penn
State. ,

“People look down on Pitt,” Kopp

explained, hinting toward Penn State. .

“We’ve got to get our respect back.”
“Pitt-Penn State has always been a big
deal. Growing up [in Pittsburgh], at chtnch
and at school, you always had your Pitt fans
and your Penn State fans.” .
-Nicole Bashor, the current goalkeeper for
Pitt’s women’s soccer team, was also heavi-

lyrecruitedbyPennStatehersenioryearin'

high school. Penn State had her believing
she’d be a Nittany Lion. — _

“I had already been on one visit. Then
the coach wanted to set up an oﬂicial recruit-
ing visit for me to stay overnight and hang
out with the team,” Bashor explained.

"The coach told me to call him the next
week,” she said. “I called, and he wasn’t
there. I ended up calling a number of times,
but I never heard ﬁom Penn State again.”

No one from Penn State’s athletics

department ever called her back or explained I

why the school stopped recruiting her so
abruptly, which is ‘why Bashor now
describes Penn State as her “arch enemies
and bitter rivals.”

-Rande Stottlemyer, Pitt’s head wresﬂing

coach, was a student at Pitt in the 1970s.

“I think there was a healthy respect
among the players, but I think it was a little
more than a friendly rivalry. It was pretty
ﬁerce to say the least,” said Stottlemyer
about his memories of those classic football
gameshewatchedasafan. “Iheiewereno
two ways about it; we wanted to beat Penn
State and Joe Paterno.” »

“I was a little ticked at Penn State when
they went to the Big Ten and didn’t keep us
on their schedule,” he said. “Even if they’re
intheBigTen, theycanstillkeepusontheir
schedule.”

-Foge Fazio was Pitt’s head football coach
from 1982 to 1985 and currently is the
defensive coordinator. for the Minnesota
Vikings. He has coached at the college and
professional levels all over the country and
he feels that, at its height, the Pitt-Penn‘State
rivalry was among the best.

“In-state rivalries are great Just like

Michigan-Michigan State, it’s a great game
every time the two teams play,” said Fazio.

He feels the players’ experiences in
those big games _help create a brotherhood of
former Panthers.

"There are a lot of guys around the
[NFL] that played at Pitt, and we all have a
special bond,” hesaid.

-Rob Loper is a wresﬂer for Pitt and dislikes
Penn State perhaps more than anyone else .

“I f-—’ hate them,” he said. “Fromthe
time I was old enough to know what college
was, I knew there were two schools I would
never go to: Penn State and West Virginia

“I don’t like anyone tlmt goes to that
school. If my mother went there, I wouldn’t
like her. I wouldn’t even talk to her anymore.»

"Iheir fans have no class. We wresﬂed
them at Penn State two years ago, and I
knew for sure I wasn’t going to lose. After I
won,Iwasta1kingtrashtotheirfans. Ibeat
that kidjust for spite; I’ll do_what I have to
do to beat anyone from Penn State.”

Venues also acid to Pitt vs. Penn State rivalry

Birad Cuprick
For The Pitt News

This weekend, another chapter of the
great Pitt-Penn State rivalry will be written.
For the ﬁrst time since Thanksgiving Day
1991, the Nittany Lions will come to
Oakland to play at Pitt Stadium. V

Lost in every great rivalry are the loca-
tions of the ﬁerce battles. Home—ﬁeld advan-
tage is more of a factor when the fans get
brutal with their comments and the stadiums
become very hostile environments.

Last September, Pitt’s football team,
fresh off a convincing victory over the
Southwest Louisiana Ragin’ Cajuns, visited
State College, Pa. The main purpose of the
Panthers’ trip was to defeat Penn State.
Although their goal was not achieved, the
players did get to see the fourth-largest col-
lege football stadium in the country. Pardon
the members of the squad if they were a lit-
tle intimidated by the 97,115 screaming fans
packed into the grassy ﬁelds that were the
parking lots and into the enormous building
called Beaver Stadium.

Built originally in 1909, New Beaver
Field was dismantled and moved in 700
pieces to the east side of Penn State’s cam-

, pus in 1960. When it was moved, 16,000

seats were added to accommodate the

demand of the alumni and students. The sta-
dium was built in the shape of a horseshoe
and has undergone numerous additions and
expansions since then. Six dilferent renova-
tion projects have occurred in the past 30

years, more than doubling the stadium in A

size and ‘modemizzing its features. There is
also news of 10,000 more seats being added
before the start of the 2001 season. The Penn

game was similar to last week’s 48-3 nail-
biter over Bowling Green that allowed Joe
Patemo to earn his 300th career victory this
past Saturday. Traveling west to Oakland,

for 30 percent of the fans attending the game.

The largest crowd for a game at Beaver
Stadium was last season against eventual
national champion Michigan. The Lions lost
that one, 34-8, leaving many of the 97,498
that showed very disappointed after the
debacle. '

Games have been played on grass since

& Lee, 26-0, in 1925. .

Originally conﬁgured to hold 69,400, ‘
the stadium was reconstmcted and now
holds 56,500. W.S. Hindman, a graduate of
Pitt’s engineering program, designed the sta-

V ditun that was built by Turner Construction

The oval-shaped stadium hasn’t ‘had i

nearly as many renovations as Beaver. The
changes done to Pitt Stadium have mostly
come on the ﬁeld. The Panthers ﬁrst played

on natural grass, but With the invention and ‘

useof artiﬁcial turf sweeping the nation, the
University decided to switch to AstroTurf in
1970. Superturf, a substitute for AstroTlJ1f,
was put down in 1984. Since then, the
Panthers have gone back to playing on
AstroTurf, and there are some rumors that
they will play on natural grass in the near
future. But not at Pitt Stadium. The
Pittsburgh Steelers will be moving into a
new facility on the North Side, and rumors
suggest that there have been discussions with
Steelers President Dan Rooney about the
Panthers using that same stadium for home
games.

Although not considered modern
except for the use of an instant~replay screen
installed before last season, Pitt Stadium is
just what college football is about: tradition.

- Tradition is what made the Pitt-Penn State

rivalry last throughout the decades, despite
attempts to end it.

Asaparenttellshischildafterbeing
ridiculed for his looks, it’s what is inside that
counts. That said, Pitt Stadium should _be
judged on the tens of thousands of screaming
fans who make it a diﬂicult place for the
Panthers’ opponents to play. .

School mascots face off

Jim Griefe

For The Pttt News

The Pitt vs. Penn state match-up is one
of the country’s oldest, but much is misun-
derstood aboutthe origin of one of these
schools’ mascots.

Everyone knows what a panther is, but
no one‘ except maybe JoePa could tell you
what a “Nittany Lion” is.

OK, here it is folks»: the Nittany Lion
explained. -

Anyone who reads this can no longe
say, “What’s a Nittany?” However, any
comments about the stupidity of this name
are still valid. 4

The name Nittany comes from a moun-
tain near the Penn State campus. Nittany (or
Nita-Nee) was the name of a Native

enough to be the subject of a Disney movie,
so they named a mountain after her.

The Pittsburgh Panthers and Penn State
Nittany ‘Lions have met 93, times since
1893.

Well, that is not entirely true. Penn State has
only been the Nittany Lions since 1906.
; And while Pitt’s school colors have always
been blue and gold, Penn State’s colors
- were once pink and black. . _

, The Penn State student body decided on
 the add color scheme in 1887. When the
 V, university realized that pink and black were
 obviously 1880s fad colors, the school col-
ors were changed to blue and white in 1890
(Joe Patemo was a young 45 years old at the

American princess who was not.quite cool .

time). , _ j
The Lion part of the Crappy Valley story
is easier to explain. The University wanted a

mascot after seeing the Princeton Tiger at an _

away baseball game.’ The student body
decided on the Lion because the mountain
lion was once indigenous to the area, and no

I other school had the lion as its mascot.

-The history lesson doesn’t stop there.
"Pitt started calling itself the Panthers in
1909. George M. P. Baird made the sugges-
tion, and was then voted upon by the student
body. The student body agreed to. the
Panthers for several reasons.

Like the lion, the panther was indige-
nous to the region at one time. Also, the
color of-the panther’s fur coat was close to

the gold that the University used as its offi-_

cial school color, and no other college used
the panther as its mascot at that time. .

As you canclearly see, the panther has
so. much more going for it. Have you

-noticed that the mountain lion no longer

inhabits Central Pennsylvania? That’s
because the panther kicked its ass before
heading to Carolina and Florida.

Here is the part where you gasp. In real-
ity, the panther and mountain lion are the
same species (Felis concolor). The moun-
tain lion is basically a panther who couldn’t
take, the city.

So having said that, the two schools,
teams and mascots should be equally
matched. The cat with the home-field
advantage should come away ‘victorious,
right? I guess we will see on Saturday.

THE Pin News: SPECIAL EDITION

Tnunsnmr, 107 Srmmnm 1998

A There are a lot of thingsl love about
Pitt. I love greasy ﬁies from the “O” and
25-cent drafts on Thursday nights. I love

the “urban charm” of South Oakland and ‘

the Gothic beauty of the Cathedral of
Leaming.

But the thing I love more than any-
thing else about Pitt is the tradition of
yelling “Penn State Suc ” during our ﬁght
song.

For those of you who are freshmen
and might not be familiar with what I’m
talking about, shame on you, but I’ll
explain.

It’s a long-standing tradition at sport-
ing events here, no matter who we_’re play-
ing, to yell “Penn State Sucks, Penn State
Sucks” and then spell it out —— “P-E-N-N-
S-T-SUCKS” — at a certain point in the
Pitt ﬁght song, even though spelling it will
not help Penn-State fans at all.

That is a tradition more unique than
any sports tradition I’ve ever seen because
whether we’re playing Penn State in foot-
ball or Georgetown in basketball, the Pitt
Proud express their hatred for Penn State.

Traditions are a big part of college

football, and while our tradition might not
be as “honored” as something like touching
the “Play Like a Champion Toda ” sign at
Notre Dame, it is
uniquely ours, and
that’s what makes it
so cool.

I love looking at
the confused looks
on, say, the Rutgers
basketball fans when
Pitt fans yell “Penn
State Suc .”

It’s unique, it’s
original, and it’s a
hell of a fun tradition.
The exact opposite of
original and unique is
Penn State. I mean
really, take a look at
their chant V ~

They cram almost 100,000 people into
Beaver Stadium; then half of the stadium
yells, “We Are!” and the other half yells,
“Penn State!” '

“We are Penn State.” That’s it. Not
“We Are Number One,” not “Go Lions.”

 
 
 

Over and over again, it’s just repetition of
the blatantly obvious. S

“We are Penn State”  no shit.

Yeah, it’s
impressive to hear
100,000 people
chant that, but it
would be impressive
to hear 100,000 peo-
ple chant anything;
it’s what they’re say-
ing tl1at’s so stupid.

H o n e s t 1 y ,
though, the Penn
State chant ﬁts right
in with the rest of
their unimaginative
existence.

Look at their
unifomls. Plain. No

logo. Unimaginative.
Then the name of the town tl1ey’re in.
I can imagine the conversation long ago, ‘
when the founding fathers of Penn State
were laying out plans for the university.
’ “OK gentlemen, we’re creating the
State University of Pennsylvania. What

can we call the town that will build up
around it?” .

' “Why don’t we call it ‘State
College’?”

What imagination.

You won’t ﬁnd a cooler, more unique
tradition in sports than our “Penn State
Suc ” chant. At times, the University has
tried to discourage it by promoting the
“real” words, “Fight, Pitt, Fight. Fight, Pitt,
Fight. V-I-C—T-O-R-Y.”

You tell me which is cooler.

On Saturday, shout, yell and
SCREAM, “Penn State Sucksl”.

Scream it proudly, just like all the
alumni who were here before us did. Be
proud because it’s something uniquely Pitt.

Maybe we can yell it loud enough to
let Pitt Athletics Director Steve Pederson
and Penn‘ State Athletics Director Tim
Chirley know just how much this rivalry
means to us and how much we want to
keep it going forever!

get started, we’d like to thank every-
one at the University of Pittsburgh for
having our football team over for the
weekend. To kick your ass. Again.

Last season, our quarterback
passed for a record against your team
— and he wasn’t even that good. You
guys just sucked. But if you had all our
great players -that are from Pitt — oh,
that’s right, yinz want to be called
Pittsburgh now — you’d_be a perenni-
al powerhouse just like your in—state
rivals. But we’re not rivals anymore.
In a true rivalry, teams exchange wins
and losses, and the outcome is nearly
always in question.

We’ve beaten yinz five straight
times. And in the last two games,
we’ve conquered yinz by a combined
score of 46-15. That’s why good high

to play yinz’s sorry excuse for a team.
Hell, we won’t even have any fans
there because they’ll all be afraid that
the seats beneath them will break, and
they will all fall to their grizzly deaths
and be eaten by cockroaches.

Y1nz’s only hope of beating us is
that our comerbacks and receivers
might slip in the sinkholes around mid-
ﬁeld. After all, yinz are used to that. If
yinz ever have any children who aspire
to be good football players, do one
thing don’t let them watch
Pittsburgh play. They do not deserve
something as evil as that. And remem-
ber, cruel and unusual punishment is
unconstitutional.
