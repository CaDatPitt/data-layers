SGB campaigns cost nearly $7000

Staff Writer

Today marks the end of a
campaign that the Student
Government Board’s elections
committee has been busily
preparing for since September,
costing nearly $7,000 in campaign
and election expenditures.

According to Nicole Vitale,
elections committee chairperson,’
none of the $6,934.60 allotted for
elections by the SGB allocations
committee is used for the
candidates’ personal campaign
funds.

“We allocate no money for the
candidates," she said. “They use
their own money, or money that
comes from endorsements.”

Vitale said that recognized
student organizations are allowed
to give no more than ‘$25 to
candidates they endorse, which
is most often used for
advertisements. “We check

Pitt receives grant for Asian studies

The SGB candidates have
spoken out about what problems
they think warrant the most
attention by the SGB in the coming
year. But do their top concerns

- match those of the students they

represent?

The Pitt News conducted a
random survey ‘of 72 students on
Monday to find out. The students
were asked to list the three most
important problems they would

Pitt’s Asian studies program can
expectto broaden its horizons in
the upcoming year, thanks to a
$30,000 grant it received last
month. ’

The grant was donated to the
Asian studies program by the
NKKCorp.,Japan’s second largest
steelmaker, on Oct. 17.

Pitt communication
representativejan Barnford noted
that NKK currently owns 50
percent of the Pittsburgh- based
National Steel Corporation, and
“all indicators are that NKK will

9 take over the entire company in

the future." Therefore, she added,
the importance of this giant is

:"~.that it represents the progress

everything,” she said of their
campaign expenditures. “We even
check receipts.”

The allocated money is instead
used for ballots, posters, banquet
programs, Meet the Candidates,
the presidential debate, election
day costs and an inauguration
banquet in January, which is the
single most expensive campaign
investment at $3,140.

Vitale said this year's campaign,
which has 12 board candidates
vying for eight places and two
hopefuls for the presidential slot,
has been “very interesting. I'm
glad to see this turnout of
candidates. They seem very
concerned, and both presidential
candidates are qualified.”

However, “a little tension has
been present in the SGB office
lately, " Vitale said, “because both
candidates for president work up
there, so they both have their
‘little cliques.’ They’re both just
trying to win. .

received the most votes with 25
students _ expressing
dissatisfaction with the existing
state of on—campus housing.
Predominant complaints included
a lack of on-campus housing, the
cancellation of maid service in
suites, elevator breakdowns and
no cable television in rooms.

-Complaints about Pitt’s meal
plans were second with 22 votes.
Many students living on campus
said they were upset because Pitt
requires them to purchase a meal
plan. Some suggested that the

toward increased relations
between the United States and
Japan. According to Keith Brown,
director Br the Asian studies
program, the grant is expected to
help expand instruction beyond
the traditional areas of language,
culture and history.

“The NKK award will enable
the university to extend the {Asian}
studies program into the
professional schools‘ and
sciences," Brown said.

Speciﬁc plans for allocating the
grant money include underwriting
new courses inJapanese studies,
organizing seminars, workshops

and lectures, as well as furthering

the development of Japanese
language material in the university
library system.

“Now is the time to train

“This year, ‘with two
presidential candidates, I think
we’ll have a very big voter
turnout," she said. Last year, the
lone candidate for president,
Kent Baldauf, collected
“approximately 1,200 votes.”

About 25 people will be
working at the polls again today,
Vitale said. “Usually we let the
current board members work at
the polls, but this year, since
both presidential candidates
work in the SGB office, we
decided that wasn't a good idea.”

After the polls shut down at 6
p.m. this evening, Vitale said,
the ballots will be taken to the
SGB office to be counted. “The
only people that can count them
are members of the elections
committee."

Candidates will also know the
results tonight, ‘since each is
allowed to “wait it out” in the
SGB office with one friend.

expanded to include more
restaurants. Others complained
about the “long lines and lousy
food” in cafeterias.

-”It’s practically impossible
to find a parking space and
make it on time for my classes,”
said one of the 20 suidents who
named parking, both short- and
long—terrn, as one of the major
problems students face at Pitt.

the same question, mentioned

States andjapanl," Brown added.

NKK’s relationship with Pitt
spans more than a decade. In
1975, NKK, and 14 otherjapanese
steel corporations donated $1
million to the Asian studies
department._ »

At that time, the grant was the
largest ever received by Pitt from
a benefactor outside of the United
States. Also, in 1988, NKK
committed $50,000 to Phipps
Conservatory to restore and
expand the Japanese Gardens in
Schenley Park. That’ project,‘
which is currently under way, is
expected to .be completed
sometime in 1990.

Seven area 976—number
operators have joined forces today

_in the first-ever effort to raise

money for AIDS—related projects.

“Similar fundraisers have been
done around the country for other
causes, but we felt that Pittsburgh
demanded a program for AIDS,”
said Richard Caldwell, consultant

for the seven participating

information providers.

Fifty cents from each call made
anytime on Nov. 8 to the
participating numbers will be
donated to the Frank Borelli
Memorial Fund, which is
"administered by the Lambda
Foundation Inc. Borelli was a
Pittsburgh businessman who died
of complications from AIDS in
1985. The fund is used to help tri-
state organizations who apply for
grants to undertake AIDS-related
projects.

“We

have invited a

representative from the Lambda

 (tux_x..\1.<:\z<>..x.s.I° 

Foundation to come and read
the meters at midnight to assure
that everything is legitirnate,”
Caldwell said.

Calls to the numbers will appear I

on the callers’ phone statements
and cost 99__ cents per minute or
less. The charge is divided

- between Bell of Pennsylvania

and the sponsors. The donation
is being made from the sponsors’
share of the revenue. .
“They’ve promised to donate
$1,000 regardless of how many
calls are made,” Caldwell said.
The seven participating
numbers include: 976-1000 and
976-2246, two practical joke lines;
976-2000, “True Confessions;”
976-JOKE, featuring humor by at

‘least five different comedians

during each call; 976-3300,
featuring dating ads by women;
976-4400, featuring dating ads
by men; and 976-5500, featuring
dating ads for gay and bisexual
men. '

percentage of the callers for at
least two or three of the numbers
are directly affected by AIDS,”
Caldwell said.

Two years ago all university
phones were blocked from
dialing 976 numbers, even with
the use of an access code.

“We’re hoping that the students
and faculty who live off-campus

' will still try to participate in the

beneﬁt," Caldwell said.

Caldwell said that none of the
976 numbers contain sexually
explicit material and that very
strict guidelines on the content
of the messages are followed.

“After August of 1988, new
laws prohibit sexually explicit
language on any 976 exchange.
Now to hear those types of
messages, you have to write to
the phone company to havethe
automatic block removed from
the 556 exchange, where those
types of messages are found,"
Caldwell said.

Drug to prevent organ transplant rejection developed

By Linda Marie Micco
Staff Writer

University of Pittsburgh
transplant researchers have
discovered a powerful immune
system-suppressant that has been
remarkably successful at
preventing the rejection of
transplanted organs.

Dr. Thomas Starzl pioneered
the clinical use of the drug,
referred to as FK—506, which was
originally derived from a fungus
found in Japanese soil. Rejection
of new organs is up to 90 percent
less when patients aregiven PK-
S06 compared with cyclosporin,
the anti-rejection drug which has
been -used for the past nine
years.

“FK-S06 promises to
revolutionize the field of
transplantation, allowing this

Of the many varied responses,

the two which were most‘

causes for this rift were cited by
the candidates as racism, sexism
and widespread student apathy.
The need for improved campus
security was addressed by Cohen,

Starzl and the research team
attended the European Transplant
Society meeting in Barcelona,
Spain, last week to present a
summary of clinical and research
data about the new drug.
Researchers have found that FK—
506 does not cause the life-
threatening adverse effects
associated with cyclosporin
treatment such as kidney damage,
high blood pressure and heart
disease. In addition, physicians
have found that . FK—506

rejection with the cyclosporin
treatment FK—506 halted the
rejection of her liver and now
she is back at work.

Of the first 50 patients to receive
FK-S06, only two have
experienced any signs of
rejection, and both cases were
controlled by an increased dose
of the drug. Dr. John Fung, who
has been working with Starzl for
the past four years, is excited
about the clinical application of
FK-506.

“With cyclosporin, we would
have expected to have about six
or seven patients out of 50 lose
their liver to rejection or from
other causes, and we have not
had any of those,” Fung said.
“We didn’t try to go out and find
the best patients for this study.
[We studied) all types of patients
and all of the livers have worked. ”

was even contemplating, ‘Do I
want to live like this?’
. “It was very scary. I researched
cyclosporin and I knew what it
could do — heart disease and
kidney problems a and I didn’t
even want [the transplant]
surgery,” Santoro said. “I knew
what was in my future with
cyclosporin.”

Last September, when Santoro’s
liver disease became critical, she
heard about FK—506 and agreed
to have the liver transplant. “I did
it without a moment’s hesitation.
I thought, ‘It's OK now to have
the surgery.”’

Now Santoro has a new liver
and she is taking FK-506. For the
first time in years, she is able to

eat red meat and cheese without
feeling pain. She is looking
forward to going home and being
with her husband and family
again. “I feel ﬁne,” she said.

FK—506 is also being used
successfully with organ
transplants in young children.
Because the new drug is more
effective than cyclosporin at
preventing organ rejection, the
transplant team has been able to
reduce the amount of steroids
the children are given.

“The main problem with kids is
that they all get stunted growth
[from steroids], ” Fung said. “They
look funny and when the kids go
home, on paper they look perfect,
but they don’t look normal." Fung
is hopeful that children being

treated with FK—506 will achieve

Thus far according to Fung, the
only side effects which have been
associated with FK-506 are
tingling of the feet, nausea and
headaches. These problems
dissipate when patients are given
the drug in capsule form rather
than intravenously.

The potential long-range effects
of FK—506 are still unknown. The
researchers are carefully watching
patients who are taking FK-506
for specific kinds of cancer and
infections which can occur with

the use of powerful immune-
suppressing drugs. Fung is

looking forward to the time when I

“At this point, we're almost

Corruption plagues

The verdict is finally in. I
Ben Woods, former acting president of City
Council, has been convicted by a jury of his

, peers on 17 counts, including two counts of

conspiracy, one count of racketeering, seven
counts of extortion, five counts of tax evasion
and two counts of filing false tax returns.

Woods’ co-defendant Michael Hartman, who
is a contractor from Pleasant Hills, was" also
convicted on several similar counts.

'Woods, who resigned from his position just
hours before the jury convicted him, faces up
to 20 years in jail on each of the extortion
counts.

To make matters worse, Woods is not the first
city councilman to have been convicted for
accepting payoffs from contractors in need of
work. In 1909, "Councilmen John F. Klein,
William Brand and Joseph Wassen were con-
victed of accepting bribes from a builder who
wanted the city to use his paving blocks on

In addition to extortion, city officials — in-
cluding the mayor of Pittsburgh -—‘ have been

1' accused of a number of things. During the

depression, Mayor Charles Kline was convicted
of padding the purchase price of three used
trucks, for which he served six months in jail.
In more recent times, Allegheny County Dis-
trict Attorney Robert Dugan was under investi-
gation for allegedly accepting bribes from
racketeers; however, 15 minutes before he was
-to be indicted for tax evasion, his body was
found outside his home. He had shot himself in
the head. _ I
Not only is it unfortunate that the city of
Pittsburgh has been made to pay for the

A mistakes of its elected officials in the past, but

judging from the track record, it is very likely
that the corruption that plagues city politics will
continue in the future. It seems that nothing is

spared the ugly hand of corruption — and City '

Council is no exception.

The University of Pittsburgh's place-
ment service for student employ-
ment is a great service that can truly
beneﬁt students who choose to use
it For the students who are not
aware of its existence and services,

‘ the placement’ center is located at
200 William Pitt Union. At no cost,

the service helps employers and

students come together to create

and ﬁll jobs. ‘

Students who do employ this serv-
ice, however, must keep in mind
several things about jobs in Pitts-
burgh. I have lived in Pittsburgh for
18 of 20 years of life, and I am
familiar with this city, particularly
employment situations here. Cer-
tainly Pittsburgh is a city with a
relatively low_ cost of living and a
relatively low unemployment rate.
Employment wages are directly
proportional to the low cost of liv-
ing, so they too are relatively low. At
least this is all true in comparison to
the rest of the cities in America.

Flag burning: ‘it's time

I sit here, 2:30 a.m. Oct. 31, 1989,

where some damn foreigner was
burning an American ﬂag on the
steps of the -Capitol Building. He
said he hopes to have the “constitu-
tionality” of the new anti—ﬂag burn-
ing law put into check. It's about
time for Americans to take a stand
and put an end to this treasonous
school of thought. We've been put-
ting up with their bullshit long
enough. Although I am not a skin-
head [and do not] have any ties to
them, it is hard [for] a man who loves
his country not to ﬁnd some truth in
the lyrics of the Skrewdriver song:

“I stand and watch my country

going down the drain,
We are all at fault now we are all

In general, the average part-time

, job for students in Pittsburgh has

a wage rate of approximately $5
per hour. Some jobs pay less,
some pay more and some wages
are negotiable. Most good jobs
are above minimum wage ($3.70

 

per hour) by some degree. In the
student employment’ office,
however, many of the jobs listed
pay only minimum wage, or just
slightly above. It is my opinion
that employers using this service
to advertise available jobs for
students are taking advantage of
students by offering lower wages
than they should.

‘Canes keep their quarterback tradition doubly strong  

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

The faces have changed at the
University of Miami, but the song
remains the same. Unfortunately
for opponents, the Hurricane
football team doesn’t Whistle
Dixie.

A never-ending string of
exemplary quarterbacks that
began with Jim _Kelly and
continued with the likes of Bernie
Kosar, Heisman Trophy winner
Vinny Testaverde and Steve Walsh
has been supplemented this
season by freshman quarterback
Gino T orretta.

Toretta has completed 98 of
171 passes for 1,280 yards and

eight touchdowns. Pitt’s Alex Van’

Pelt, another of the nation's
outstanding freshman signal-‘
callers, doesn’t pale in T oretta’s
shadow, however. Van Pelt _has
completed 116 of 198 passes for

1,584 yards and 11 touchdowns. _

But the Hurricanes are a football
team that does not like to be
outdone. T orretta, you see, is a
backup. Starting quarterback
Craig Erickson has passed for
1,174 yards on 86 completions
for six touchdowns. T orretta

C became the starter when Erickson
suffered a broken knuckle on his

throwing hand against Michigan
State, Miami’s fourth opponent.
The two quarterbacks have led
the Hurricanes to a 7-1 record, its

only loss coming against intra-A 1.

state rival Florida State two weeks
ago.

Pitt enters Saturday’s game at
Pitt .Stadium with a 5-1-1 record.

The Panthers, and the
Hurricanes for that matter, aren’t
sure which quarterback will start.
Erickson’s passing has been
limited by swelling in his injured
hand, and first-year Miami Coach
Dennis Erickson said [Craig]
Erickson has recovered to only
the 80 or 85 percent mark.

“I think Andre.Collins is probably
as good a linebacker as wehave
had- around here,” and Collins’
play really backs that statement
up. _But when it comes to making
the pros at that position, the
question is will Collins be able to
make an NFL roster at 6-foot—3
“and only 200 pounds? .

By comparison, Jerry Olsavsky
of the Steelerslmade the team at
only 6-foot—1, 212 pounds. He is

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

In my opinion, it's never to late
or too early to think about
baseball. Sure the world Series
was kind of boring, but the
earthquake vastly over—shadowed
that. In fact, the earthquake was
just one of the many interuptions
the 1989 baseball season had to
compete with. '

I cannot remember a season in
which there were so many “non-
baseball” issues that affected the
game.

Spring training was barely
underway when we were
informed of two scandals:

The all-time hit leader and

manager of the Cincinnati Reds, '

Pete Rose, was accused of heavy
gambling, including wagers on
his own team. After several
months of hearings and stories
from witnesses, he ﬁnally resigned
from the game of baseball, but
can still possibly be reinstated

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Block Action‘ Society V .

next year.

We were also treated to the
details of the Wade Boggs sex
scandal, which revealed that he
had Margo Adams as his mistress
of four years to comfort him on
"those long road trips. She used
her newfound popularity to

celebration.

Jim Abbott made the California
Angels’ starting rotation without
ever pitching in the minor leagues;
he also did it without a right
hand. There are those who
thought it was done to boost
ticket sales, but his performance

 

appear in showed he
magazines and be1onged_
on talk shows. Lonnie
Onsept. 1,1 5 m it h
was at Three battled
_Rivers Stadium back from
whenllearned » d r u g

that Commissioner. A. Bartlett
Giarnatti had died of a heart attack.
"Fay Vincent was quickly named
:as his replacement.
There were
encouraging
issues in 1989:
Dave Dravecky of the San
Francisco Giants recovered from
cancer in his pitching arm to win
‘two games. In ' his second
appearance, he broke the arm,
and broke it during a clubhouse

also some
“non-baseball”

addiction to lead the Atlanta
Braves and be among the league
leaders with a .300-plus batting
average. He also used his
experience to serve as a team
leader.

When Cito Gaston’s Toronto
Bluejays battled Frank Robinson’s
Baltimore Orioles for first place
in the American League East, it
marked the first time there was a
pennant race between two black
managers.

Danyluk— The other issues of the 1989 baseball season

All these “non-baseball" issues I

can serve as an eye opener.

Very often we forget that
athletes are real people. Our
admiration and idolatry makes us
put them above reality.

Because of all the glamour of
athletics, we don’t always
remember that they can be subject
to addictions, cancer and other
illnesses, adultery, handicaps,‘
racial problems and most recently,
natural disasters.

We have to remember that
athletes are not above society,
just ‘a part of it. Major league

_ baseball (and other sports)" can ~ I
be looked upon as a microcosm '
of society. The players are not.‘

robots in a fantasy world.

The 1989 baseball season has

definitely put sports in
perspective. Although I am one
of the biggest baseball fans you’ll

ever meet, it has made even me .,

realize something: it’s just a game.
