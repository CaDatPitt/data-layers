bank thief

at large

by Drew Singer
New Editor

The suspect who robbed an
Oakland bank Tuesday remains at
large.

A 5-foot-8 black man robbed the
Parkvale Bank on 3520 Forbes Ave.
— across the street from Forbes
Hall —— Tuesday morning. The sus-
pect weighs about 220 pounds with
a stocky build and has a raspy voice,
city police say.

Both Pitt and city police re-
sponded to a 9:55 a.m. call after the
suspect pushed ‘a customer out of
the way and demanded money from
the bank. As of press time, officials
do not know how much money the
suspect got away with before exit-
ing the bank on foot down Sernple
Street toward Bates Street

Late rally comea up .4/aort

Aaarlrtant Sparta E9itor

The ﬁrst time the Pitt basketball
team reached the apex of the No. 1
ranking in the country, it remained
there for two weeks before losing.

The No. 1 will remain in front
of Pitt’s name until Monday, but the
Panthers couldn't hold the top spot
in college basketball for more than
two days.

Sloppy early play dug Pitt (25—3,
12-3 Big East) into an 18-point
halftime ditch that it couldn’t quite

climb out of in last night’s 81-73 de—i

feat to unranked Providence at the
Dunkin’ Donuts Center.

The Fiiars (17-11, 9-7) cap?

tured their first win against a No.
1—ranked program since a 1976 vic-
tory against Michigan. And on Se-

nior Night in Providence, the team’s
four elder statesmen keyed perhaps
the largest victory in their tenure.

\X/eyinmi Efejuku led the Friar
seniors with 16 points on 9—of—1O
free-throw shooting, Jonathan Kale
notched 12 of his 13 points in the
vital first half and veterans Geoff
McDermott and Randall I-Ianke
finished in double ﬁgures for Provi-
dence.

The Friars seemingly needed a
victory over the top—ranked Pan-
thers to reinvigorate hopes at an
NCAA Tournament bid and used
the motivation to jump out to a 44-
26 lead at halftime.

Pitt outscored Providence 47-37
in the second half but never led for
the ﬁrst time in a game this season.

SGB introduces new code of ethics for members

by Simone Cheatham
Sttzﬂ W/rite/'

Student Government Board
began last night’s meeting late to
watch the end of the Pitt basketball
game in an act of school spirit that
has never occurred before.

None of the boardmembers,
except Nila Devanath, arrived
until 9:15 p.m., half an hour after
the slated 8:45 p.m. start time. De-
vanath, along with other students
and committee chairs planning to

attend the meeting, were informed
of the delay through a handwritten
sign placed outside the SGB con-
ference room door. "

“I think this is very unprofes-
sional and is an example of very
ineffective communication,” said
Devanath. “I love Pitt games, too,
but there are a lot of  we
have to discuss and people have
other  to do.”

President Kevin Morrison and
board member Max Greenwald

apologized for the delay at the end v

‘Unfortunately, welost, '
which proves that Pitt
basketball is a painful

"sport to watch.

Kevin 
 Morr1son

of the meeting and said they_ felt
their “presence was necessary?’ for

watching the game.
“Unfortunately, we lost, which

proves that Pitt basketball is a pain-

ful sport to watch,” said Morrison.
“All I have to say is, ‘Hail to Pitt.’” ‘

“This is the first time this‘ has
happened, and I can’t think of a

» better reason,” he added.

In other news, board member
Charlie Shull introduced a new
SGB code of ethics.

He, along Witli Greenwald, has

been ‘working on the document
since January.

The code states that SGB will
work to represent all non—College

_of General Studies students in
a professional and collaborative-

manner while respecting the duties
of the SGB president and board

members as well as comrnittee_

chairs and members.

The code of ethics is not yet
binding, but Morrison said he in-
tends to modify the code and make
it binding. _ _

City council visits Pitt, talks dorm registrationfees

Democratic mayoral candidate and current city council member Patrick
Dowd speaks to Pitt students in the William‘Pitt Union Tuesday night.

Staﬁ’ Writer

A new registration process for
rental units should include dor-
mitories, city council members
said Tuesday night.

After tabling the possible ex-

emption for a second time two
weeks ago, Pittsburgh’s city coun- .

cil visited the William-Pitt Union

’ for a meet—and-greet hosted by

the College Democrats. -
“Dormitories are rental units
and should fall_ under rental reg-
istration,” said councilman Bruce
Kraus at the event.
Requiring dormitories to

participate in rental registration '

would force Pitt students to pay a
$12—per—tenant fee and to register
each tenant.

The council couldn’t come up
with a ‘clear deﬁnition of a dor-

mitory that would differentiate

it from an apartment complex,
Kraus said. - .

Councilman Bill Peduto said
the council couldnit exclude
dorms because the exemption
would favor universities over
other institutions, such as nurs-
ing homes.

' “You can’t speciﬁcally exempt
one group,” said Peduto. “If it
is done, it has to be done uni-
formly.” I

V The new rental registration

process currently excludes hotels’

and motels because of the tem-
porary nature of the occupants,
he said. -

The city council members
also discussed the proposal to
merge Allegheny County with
Pittsburgh. ‘

Mayoral _ candidate Patrick

"Dowd said he disagreed with

the proposal, but he thinks Al-

legheny County and all of the

municipalities within it, not just
Pittsburgh, should merge as soon
as possible. ‘‘
Allegheny County ‘contains
.131 different municipalities, and

this high number of governments ,

leads to inefficiency, Dowd said.
“We are fragmented, we’re
overbuilt, and we’re overgovern—
mented,” he said.
Pittsburgh borders 36 munici-
palities,.more than any other city
in the nation, Dowd said, and

all of these municipalities suffer

from the same problems.

‘Kraus said he would rather
see Pittsburgh slowly expand to
include the municipalities around
it instead of _,a sudden merger. '

‘kIt’s going to be a slow pro-
cess but not'an impossible pro-
cess,” he said. ' ' I

Peduto ‘agreed with Dow .

and said he.Mdoesn’t understand
the'benefits- of the current pro-

._,p.osal. _. _ . _ _.

Having grown up in Chartiers

Valley-, a Pittsburgh suburb, Pedu- ~

to said he used to watch snow-
plows deliberately not plow part

.of a street because it belonged

to a different municipality, but
would continue to plow farther
down the road. ‘
Mergers between counties
would eliminate this kind of in-
efficiency, he said. -
Dowd said that even if all the
municipalities cannot immediate-
ly combine, some of the smaller

municipalities should begin to

merge.

“Let’s at least start to see our-
selves as a confederacy of mu-
nicipalities,” he said.

During the event, the coun-
cil members. also gave advice for

those looking to get into politics.

Kraus said he learned more
abouthis ﬂaws in his two cam-

paigns for city’ council than he
has ever before.

“You have to have a very thick
skin,” he said. A

Dowd encouraged those at

_the meeing to "get involved with L
Pittsburgh politics. The city gov— . ‘

ernment needs to make changes
about how it runs and students
need to help,_ he said.’

‘.‘\We’re in one of"those mo-
ments where we can say, ‘Yes, ev-

erything’s OK,’ or we can change

things,” said Dowd.

IHOP harnesses power
of pancakes for good  

Pancakes, page 1

IHOP opened its ﬁrst two franchise restau-
rants in Western Pennsylvania, located in Robin-
son Town Centre and Uniontown, last year All
proceeds collected from these local restaurants
on National Pancake Day will directly beneﬁt

Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.

Lenow said that IHOP raised more than

. $875,000 for Children’s Miracle Network dur-

ing last years National Pancake Day celebration,
bringing total IHOP donations to almost $2 rnil—
lion over the past three years

Supporting the community far outweighs the
cost of providing free pancakes, he said

‘ ‘We don’t see it as a bother at all,’ ’ said Lenow
“It’s a lot of fun. The restaurants enjoy it,,and of
course it’s for a great cause.”

Unlike many national ﬁindraisers, said Aubrey
Cichelli, director of public relations at Children’s
Miracle Network, IHOP’s National Pancake Day
celebration is unique because all contributions

Rom the single—day event directly beneﬁt local

pediatric hospitals

Mandy Ranalli, manager of the Children’s
Miracle Network at Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh Foundation, said that because both
Western Pennsylvania IHOP franchises are new,
this was the first year that Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh participated in National Pancake Day.

Ranalli said that each network hospital can
spend its money to support its greatest needs,
such as patient care, research, equipment or train-

ing, among others At Children’s Hospital“ of 4

Pittsburgh, she said, the money will be spent in-
ternally-— as opposed to outside projects, like the
new hospital building project in Lawrenceville,
which is slated to open in May.

According to IHOP’s Web site, the mass pan-

V cake eating began hundreds of years ago to com-

memorate Mardi Gras, the day before the Lenten

 season 

Catholics traditionally observed Lent by im-
 dietary restrictions, sometimes including
eggs, milk and butter, which are key ingredients

for pancakes ' .

Robinson Town Centre IHOP served more
than 1,200 people yesterday to celebrate National
Pancake Day, said general managerjohn Swope,
who called in extra staff members for the event;
The restaurant is still  donation totals

Swope said that after he and his fellow store
managers toured Children’s Hospital of Pitts-
burgh, they decided to focus all the restaurant’s
 efforts to support the hospital.

“[National Pancake Day] is not about our
lranchise group, it’s about Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh and the miracles they perform there,”
said Swope ‘‘It’s just an incredible place.”

Barbara Tunder of Kennedy, Pa, along with
friend Helen Mannarino of McKees Rocks, Pa,
was among the customers enjoying free pancakes
at the Robinson Town Centre franchise. Al-
though she didn’t know it was National Pancake
Day, T under said that she was happy to support
Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.

“Of course, I have live kids, so we were al-
ways at Children’s Hospital,” said Tunder, a for-
mer Oakland resident; “We’re just so thankﬁil for
what it has to offer.”

Evan Stone, 3 years ' old, also celebrated
IHOP’s National Pancake Day" with his father,
DJ. Stone, of Hopewell, Pa. The family has a per-
sonal connection to Children’s Hospital of Pitts-
burgh, where Evan’s younger sister was treated
for a premature birth, said Stone

, Cichelli, as a mother of two young sons who
were treated at Children’s Miracle Network hos-
pitals, said that every donation is ‘important -
even from a fundraiser as simple as pancakes

“Most people’s lives will be impacted by a_\
Children’s Miracle Network hospital,” she said.

‘‘It’s such an easy way to  back to your com- -

munity and make a difference in the lives of
Eds,’

In the age of endless enter-
tainment variety, repetition is rare.
But repetition is what The Pitts-
burgh Savoyards is famous for.
Since 1938, the non-proﬁt commu-
nity theater has performed exclu-
sively Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
The 13 operas are the most fre-
quently performed stage produc-
tions second only to Shakespeare.
“No one else has ever grabbed
and held public attention for this
long,” said SallyDenmead, a compa-
ny member since 2004 and current
director and choreographer. “Even
though they are set in the Victorian
era, these stories are timeless. The
things thatmotivate people haven’t
changed over the centuries.”
The theater company takes

its name from the Savoy The-
ater in London, where many of
the operas co-written _by libret-
tist W.S. Gilbert and composer
Sir Arthur Sullivan premiered.

Groups throughout the world

Oftentimes two or three gen-
erations of families are involved in

The family-friendly opera has
a loyal fan base, which Denmead
hopes will help the theater compa-
ny overcome the current economic
trend of decreased spending on
entertainment.

“We’re trying to grow our
audience and get the word out ,

to audiences that don’t know

our next challenge,” ‘she said.

The company makes tickets
available to schools and other non-

of _ developing more community

yards hopes to teach through its
productions not only young per-
formers, _many of whom experi-

first time through working with the
company, but the audience as well.

It’s not easy to be selected for
Pittsburgh‘ Contemporary

According to its managing di-
rector, Jeff Oaks, a committee of

 professors meet about a

year before the scheduled read-
ings and‘ shufﬂe through hun-
dredsof names before deciding
on a list of authors to invite. The

number of ‘ these people who not

only accept, but are able to come,
eventually pushes the count of

l literary events to six to 12 a year.

 Henry Lewis was one

‘of the candidates whose name

and resume were tossed around
before being invited to give a lit-
erary readingfor the 2008-09 sea-

Lewis, a novelist from Denver,

Colo., has been awarded across a I

broad spectrum for his writing.
His short story collection, “I
Got Somebody in Staunton,”
was one of four finalists for the
PEN/ Faulkner Prize for Fiction
and made its way to the Kirkus

»Review’s top 25 books of 2005.

In addition, his nonfiction works
have been published in Black Is-
sues in ‘Higher Education, Wash-

ington Post Book and O Maga-

zine: '-
Like many writers, Lewis tries

to translate his knowledge to stu-

dents hoping to learn the craft. He
has taught at a variety of schools

around the Northeast: University

of Virginia, Denison University,
Mary Washington College’ and
Trinity College. _

‘Since members of the PCWS
committee are all supposed to
come to the meetings with a list
of authors to consider, Oaks said
that they chose Lewis because
Fiona Cheong, pa Pitt fiction writ-
ing professor, rallied for him.

“[Cheong] admires his work a
lot, so she threw his name in the
ring once that happened, we all

read up on him and agreed that he ,

would be a great fit,” Oaks said.
“It can be a very long process, we
always meet in September, but We

‘ won’t know the names for the "up-_,

coming year until March.”

Hard economic times v0U”av°r"ePaW

Pick up the    Thursday to get your ﬁll.

hit computer industry

by Donald Campbell
Colum/ziat

 

I The recent economic strifeis causing
industry after industry to decline startlingly,
and with them, the number of individual
companies involved will signiﬁcantly de-
crease as well. '

With fewer companies comes a smaller

hiring pool and ultimately a large portion, -

of the Americans without jobs.

A vicious cycle begins: As employees
from those unlucky industries begin to lose
their jobs, money becomes scarce and the
consumer spending that is so important
to the U.S. economy becomes much more
conservative. I -

This all makes sense for industries like
speculative investment banking and luxury
automobiles. If you aren’t making a salary,
why would you-ever go out and buy a brand
new BMW ? _

The computer industry does not seem
like an instant candidate for the economic
choppinglblock. Computers are, after all,

‘pervasive throughout all industries._Com—

panies surely are investing in new technol-
ogy, are they not? ,

Yes and no. Companies will always need
technology. Workhorse server machines

for every industry will continue "to be in ’

demand — and, as a result, be provided by
the major business machine manufacturers,
namely Dell and Hewlett-Packard.
Desktop computers, including home
machines and the workstations that sit at
employee desks doing mundane tasks like
Internet surﬁng, light development, e-mail
and ofﬁce tasks, are not faring nearly as

well.

An article appeared on Economist.c0m

on Jan. 15, 2009, describing a “reverse
Moore’s Law” rearing its ugly head in the
mid—recession computer market.

Moore’s Law, put most simply, says that,
cost remaining equal, the processing power
of available computer technology will dou-
ble roughly every 18 months. i ‘

The key phrase in Moore’s Law is “cost
remaining equal.” In a recession market,
companies attempt to change cost struc-
tures by reducing investments in technolo-
gy as much as possible. Companies attempt
to get more out of their computer assets.

Economist.com describes a “good
enough” phenomenon in the computer in-
dustry. For the average employee, “second-
rate” computing power is generally “good
enough.” Thus, there is no impetus for
companies to invest large sums in upgrad-
ing their employees to the best of the best,
as was the case years ago. "In terms of of-
ﬁce tasks, e-mails and Internet surﬁng, my
ﬁve-year—old ‘Pentium 4 machine performs

just as admirably as a brand new Core 2 or '

i7 machine. » _

Similar arguments can be made for
operating systems. Windows XP and its
server equivalent, Windows Server 2003,
considered archaic by a hopeful Microsoft,
is “good enough” for most companies. \

The cost and uncertainty involved in
upgrading to the state-of-the—art Windows
7 or Windows Server 2008 is unattractive
to most companies.,As a result, a perusal
of Microsoft’s stock history shows a gen-
eral, though shaky, fall -from a peak in late
2007. I .

An article in “TheRegister,” an online
British—based publication that allows read-
ers to keep tabs on the IT industry, pub-
lished an article-describing a strange trend
in Dell’s sales records in May 2008.

Dell is a major provider of computers

' eras.

Though most productions feature
professional directors, the vast major-
ity of those involved with the perfor-
mances, from performers and musicians
to crew and administrators, are volunteers.

“Having time to do something just for the
loveofitischallengingthesedays,soassembling
a cast and crew can be difficult,” said Russo.

Savoyard productions has a 22-
piece orchestra and casts as large as 30.

Finding theater space has also been chal-
lenging as rents on venues continue to climb.
The lack of a permanent home posed sev-
eral" difficulties for the company, from at-
tempting to produce shows without an ad-
ministrative office to storing costumes and

set pieces wherever possible. The company‘

currently performs in the Andrew Carn-

T egie Free Library Music Hall in Carnegie.

Each season consists of two full pro-
ductions. Tickets are offered to the public

at $17 for adults and $14 for students. This

spring’s production is “Iolanthe,” which tells -
-the story of a conﬂict between the Brit-

ish House of Lords and the  Queen.
g “Yes, it’s funny, and yes, it’s poi-
gnant, but ‘Iolanthe’ was never called a

comedy or a tragedy. It’s a fairy opera. It
deals  real themes and human emo-

tions within a fairy tale,” _ said Denmead.
“There’s a lot of silliness, but a lot of very

clever subtle humor as well,” agreed Russo.

_me,” said Adams “I was really excited when I
wonthe ﬁrstonelhadnevergotterianaward
that big before so it was really surprising to me.
When Iwon the second one, I was just shocked
——I didn’tthinkIwouldgetitagain. It’s agreat
honor to win that award, and I’m really proud
_of it.”

Adams, who is currently Pitt’s No 1 singles
player, defeated Georgetowrfs Michelle Brown
6-3, 6-2 on Saturday and George Mason’s Lind-
say Gray 6-1, 6-4 on Sunday.

‘Tve just been playing a lot of tennis lately V

and  out a_ lot,” said Adams, who is off
to a 14-0 start of her own this season.

Half of Adams’ victories are at doubles
with senior Kristy Borza, who has already bro-
ken almost every Pitt tennis record. V

_ “[Borza] is one of the greatest supporters
on the team,” said Adams. “She is always there
for me and everyone else and is a great asset to
the team.”

Pitt coach George Dieffenbach said one of
the reasons for Adams’ success is that she ex-
cels in practice and is very coachable. V

“\When I moved her to the top of the line-
up, she took that  to heart,” said Dief-
fenbach. “She has become more offensive and
more consistent”

Another  note for the Panthers came
from senior Christie D’Achille, who won four
matches as well last weekend, putting her above
the 100-win total for her career. The 100th
win came Sunday at No. 2 doubles with senior
Shannon Benic. D’Achille is just the 12th Pitt
player to win 100 matches.

“[D’Achille] has been awesome for the

team, and I’m very proud of her,” said Adams.

Another interesting rnatchup on Sundaywas
freshman Minh Evans’ 7-5, 6-3 victory over the
Pitt coach’s daughter, Sarah Dieffenbach.

“I was sure to congratulate  after a
strong victory, she played very well,” said the el-
der Dieffenbach. “They both gave 100 percent,
it was a very good match and it was great to

' watch.” 0 -

Pitt has won four straight over Georgetown.
Its next match is at home on Saturday against
i Buffalo (2-3) at 6 p.m. —

Louisville up
next for No.

And that’s when West Virginia’s scoring halted, as
Pitt responded with a scoring run of its own. The
Panthers ended the half on a 3-pointer from Scott
that placed the team ahead 28-27 at the break.

“I told the  that we would either be tied
or   into the second half” said Be-
renatn “And even though we were, we weren’t
happy about it.”

The Panthers  control in the second
half,   a 10-point advantage
Freshman forward Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson
added six" points to the team’s 12-0 run to lead
51-41. Soon after, West Virginia sophomore Liz
Rapella, who paced the Mountaineers with 17

points, connected on two 3-pointers,  it '

55-53.
But the Panthers quickly rebounded, once
again  the lead to 10, and the Mountain-

eers’s lackluster final few minutes gave the Pan-

thers a 7260 victory.
“We came here to getthe ‘W,’ andwe’re happy
we did,” said Berenato. ‘
