Contest Opens
Officially Today

Ma-rlatt To Head Judges; Winner
Will Reign Over Track,
Field Carnival June 2

Between now and April 30 pictures
may be submitted of entrants who
will participate in a campus-wide
beauty contest being sponsored by the
Pitt Panther to select the most attrac-
tive girl on the Pitt campus. Plans

;were announced yesterday by Oiiier.

l Kronenwetter, C34,, editor.

l The girl who is adjudged the win-‘

jner will have her photograph gracing
issue of the
Panther, and will also act as reigning
queen of the ceremonies at the Inter-

collegiate track and ﬁeld carnival at-

the Stadium on June 2. hccording to

Carl Olson, track coach, who is spon-

soring the meet. As an added attrac-
tion, the women who gain runner—up
places in the ﬁnal selections will act
as ladies-in-waiting for the Carnival
Queen.

Vvilliam F. Marlatt, director of the
Cap and Gown show, has been named
by the Panther as head judge of the
contest. Marlatt, besides winning

fame as a dancer in various produc—;

tions, including the Zlegfield Follies
and the Greenwich Village Fo.lies,
served on the judge’s stand at the
1927 Atlantic City bathing beauty con-
test where Dorothy Knapp, now of the
movies, was chosen Queen.

“The matter of a beauty contest on
the Pitt campus seems to me to be
an idea that might well become an
annual event,” said Marlatt. Last
year a. contest of this sort was won
by a freshman girl, which may prove
that there are no rights of seniority
in a beauty contest.

Pictures may be submitted by the
contestant or their friends, and will
be returned at the close of the con-
test. Recommendations will also be
received at the Panther office.

himself in the good will and affec-
tion of the students and faculty at

this we hope that he is right and we
wish him all success and happiness.”

fof superinteiident of the Juvenile De-
tention home. Ye believe that he

Inquiry Hears Dr. Beaven
Discuss Fate Of Religion

Discussing the fate of religious and -
anti-religious movements in the
future before the Inquiry club ‘Ved-
nesday, Dr. Albert W. Beaveii of
Rochester, New York, said, “Our ex-
periments with non-religious think-
ing, such as atheism and license,
which are against the restrictions of
religious codes, have been pretty
widely tried out. We are now in
a position to properly evaluate them.
No one, I think, will contend they
have been satisfactory.”

The essence of religion, according
to Dr. Beaven, is “a great universal”
around which other things organize.
When questioned about the masses of
Soviet Russia that are being brought
up with little or no concept of re-
ligion, Dr. -Beaven said, “I believe
that inevitably Russia. will have to
return to a religion. The state is not
big enough to be worshipped and as
a religious substitute it only leads to
narrow national obsessions and in-
evitable ‘ class struggle.”

§Expect 1934 Cap, Gown
* Show To Oversliadow  
Previous Revues

 

“Hello Again," the Cap and Gown
lproduction for this year, will open on
‘Monday night at the Syria Mosque
for a select showing spoiisored by the
Shriners_ The orchestra. will be con-
ducted by Dr, Benjamin Levant and
the octette will be directed by Gus
Schiia.bel. Beneiited by the advance
showing the Cap and Gown cast
would give a very successful presenta-
tion when they opeii at the Nixon
on Tliui‘sda_v, April 19.

Assured of a complete sell out, the
Cap and Gown artists will present a.
production that will overshadow by
far previous presentations. With a
cast 50 per cent larger than that of
last year, and with many specialty
numbers the show is certain to be a
. huge success.

Jack Wyeth, who scored last year
with his “l\:lrs. Pride,” will display his
talents as the notorious Mae West.
{William Flaherty, the agile dancer
lof last year’s production, will again
ithrill, the audience by his graceful
idancing. Besides the takeoff on Mae

West, a scene of Sewickley beach on
la Fourth of July twenty-five years
fago, and a miniature fashion show,
;will constitute scenes that should
gconvulse the audience. Eight shapely
imodels will take part in the fashion
display, which is expected to produce
something more than “the new
styles.” _

John Hollingswortli, Ray McCune,
Robert Bowdler, and the men’s chorus
will take Dart in the ancient beach
scene in which the latest bathing
suits and tennis outﬁts of 1909 will
be prominently displayed.

Harry Parker will do a solo nuniber
made up of a Stephen Collins Foster
medley, with the octette as back-
ground. “Cocktail Time,” a skit "of
iT‘(>"f1§3‘,“’” "' a ICVVA ‘number glorifying
the works administration with stirring
music, and a marionette novelty will
all feature the show.

Director William Marlatt has an-
nounced that the revue will consist of
two acts. thirty scenes, sixteen mu-
sical numbers. and twelve skits and
novelties. He says, “this year we’re
using more performers than ever be-
fore, and in our Chinese scene, the
, men will wear the most elaborate cos-
tumes we’ve ever had in Cap and
Gown.”

Frank Heiiiliert, Robert Bowdler,
Marshal Baker, George Golanty, and:
lRichard Stone were tapped to the un-
gdergraduate Cap and Gown club at

Do Not Surrender Your Card

ELTABLE lll*]POl{'l‘S have been brought to the Pitt News that

pre-election political “undercover” activities of an unsavory
ﬂavor are being carried on by the campus political machine whose
similar activities in the past created much opposition. It has been
shown, and with definite proof, that registration cards are being so-
licited by menibers of the machine. Obviously, the cards are intend-
ed for one and only one purpose-—to garner additional illegal votes
at the approacliing campus election. People do not go around gath-
eriiig rcgisti‘atioii cards because they like to trip up and down
Alumni hall steps.

Readers of the Pitt News are urgently requested not to surren-
der their registration cards and to report any occurrences of irregu-
lar character to responsible editors of the News who will take the
facts before the offices of the dean of men and dean of women and
before the nominating committee of the Student—Faculty association
of the University. Above all, do NOT surrender your card. No per-
son other than you has a right to your registration card for any pur-
pose whatsoever. The cause of clean government on the campus
should not be set back by the illegal activities of the machine or by
the disinterest of the general student body.

E CONSll)EREl) it an important step forward in Pitt history

when the student body approved by a vote of two to one the by-
laws of the new governmental setup. \Ve shall not now surrender
our posts, scrap our convictions, forget the welfare of the l.7niversity
and its lllé‘..*-‘S of students, simply because “cl1ildren will be children”
and insist on playing the kind of politics that even the most noto-
rious politicians shun. Political privateering on the Pitt campus
must be outlawed. The general student body must strike in the com-
ing elections and deﬁnitely put an end to the political activities of
children who are blinded by the mirage of dance chairmanships and
gagged by vanity which has wrought battle after battle among Pitt

 

students.

We suggest to the nominating committee for the new group that
students who are caught soliciting registration cards not be consid-
ered for nomination this year or any other year they remain on the
Pitt campus.

IT IS lMPORTA.\"'l‘ that every student vote in the coming election.

Regardless of which persons _vou favor, whether you are frater-
nity or non-fraternity, Alpha coalition or Beta coalition, or anything
else, the Pitt News feels that you ought to register your vote. But
not the votes of a dozen of your friends! That isn’t even good
politics.

No one relishes a good, clean, hard-fought political tussle more
than the Pitt News. But political activities such as those we have
described have no place at Pitt or anywhere else.

Vote in the campus election. Vote your OWN registration card.

Letters From Readers

 

Editor, The Pitt News: A

I think it unfortunate that you, a non-fraternity man, wrote the editorial,
“Must Fraternities Go?" How much stronger the editorial might have been
and more factual the comments had it been written by a man thoroughly in-
formed and unbiased in his opinion. My ﬁrst reaction was to ignore the com-
ments, for those of us who are sincerely interested appreciate the values of
fraternities. On second thought I decided to answer the editorial in an at-
tempt to have justice done the fraternity groups.

The fact that 3. young lady at the University of VVisc.onsin ran away from
school and her family, leaving an unexplainable note mentioning her sor-
ority does not condemn sororities and fraternities. The young lady was likely
a mental case. Every day we hear of young people running away from home
never to return and wives leaving their husbands (or the reverse) yet for
these reasons we do not condemn the institutions of the home and marriage.

I desire to answer the fraternity “short-comings” as you see them:

1 “They breed clannishness and snobbery, etc.” Man is gregarious by nature
and it is to be expected that students will have special friends and form
small groups within the larger University group. Fraternities promote de-
velopment of the individual and provide social leadership for the campus
and are no mo1‘e snobbish to the unaffiliated than one activity is to another

. “Tliey create cliques and take part in politics, etc.” In any society cliques
develop. The cliques of which you speak are not the objectionable type
where all the fraternity men are against the non—fra-ternity group, but a
liealthy contest of fraternity group against fraternity group, giving the
rest of the campus an opportunity to choose which is best or a clear
course to sail through the middle.

. “Pitt does not need fraternities.” Frequently we have been told the frater-
nities are forces for good on the campus and are valuable departments of
education. I liardly need mention that fraternities offer satist‘a.ctory homes
and environments for many students who would otherwise have to live in
the unwholesome Oakland district.

.“l"rate'rnities sidetrack loyalty.” Fraternities train their men to show
loyalty ﬁrst to the University and secondly to the fraternity. The fresh-
man of which you speak doubtless was enthusiastic in his membersliip and
his opinion hardly represented mature judgment. The history of our
Alumni Association shows that fraternity members generally become our
most loyalalumni. A fraternity teaches ﬁdelity and loyalty which we
readily recognize as worthy characteristics.

. “Fraternities do not allow their men to interest themselves in activities.”
Activities are helpful in the development. of any student. The fact that
fraternities encourage their members to participate in activities is coin-
mendable, for students need the experience which activities offer. If a
boy is “baited” into an activity for which he is i11—suited he soon settles to
his proper level and others more able, reach the top positions. A littie
participation is better than none. ,

There are many values in fraternities and fraternity membership which

I shall not mention here, wishing only to answer the charges which you have

made. Apparently you do not know that there exists at the University a com-

mittee just such as you suggest, which has charge of and weighs the values
of fraternities. This committee welcomes adverse criticism and I consider it
quite capable of deciding whether fraternities are valuable and needed at

Pitt. I suggest you direct your comments to them rather than editorially

airing your personal opinions, based upon uninformed facts, before the Uni-

versity and Pittsburgh community.

Fraternity scholastic records for
the past semester were the lowest
since 1927-28, according to ﬁgures just
released to the Pitt News by The-
odore Biddle, assistant dean of men,
In addition to having one fraternity
set a record all-time low ﬁgure, the
fraternity average dropped from 1.238
last year to 1.18 last semester.

These ﬁgures, as released by M.r.
Biddle, were prepared in the offices

of John G. Quick, University regis-
trar. Comparative ﬁgures released for
the three professional fraternities,

however, indicated that they had held
up their somewhat higher standing,
their average being 1.466.

The Interfraternity council schol-
astic trophy, now held by Pi Lambda
Phi, is being challenged by Sigma Al-
pha Mu, which last semester com-
piled an average almost .12 ligher

Women Receive Measurement
Sheets For Opinions

In accordance with the revision and
improvement of the student campus

ing the women students in order to

determine their opinions on and sug-
gestions for improvement of the 1933-
34 association program,

YVVCA program measurement sheets
have been distributed among the wo-
men students. These sheets list the
main projects which the association
has sponsored. Blanks are also pro-
vided on which to rate the affairs in
which the women have participated,
to recommend new projects and to
veto projects which they consider un-
successful.

“We ask members and women of
-the campus to make a judgment in
the light of their own experience,”
says Miss Helen Battrick, executive
secretary of the YWCA, “and add your
suggestions, Members should feel it
is their program and feel free to ex-
press their personal opinions.”

The data obtained from the com-
piled results will be used speciﬁcal-
ly in discussions at the spring cab-
inet retreat at Trinity Manor on May
12-13.

.Any woman, member or non-mem-
ber, who has not received a copy of
the measurement sheet and wishes to

express her opinion, may get a copy
lfrom one of the cabinet women or
call for a sheet at the YWCA ofﬁce.
All surveys of the YMCA program
should be turned in by 4:30 o'clock
today.

at Heinz House for this ofﬁce.

Marguerite Swank and Frieda Gold-
stein were elected president, and vice
president respectively of the VVomen’s

I
I
I
I Pitt's ﬁrst annual track and ﬁeld
I clinic gets under way at 10 o’clock to-
§morrow morning when local and dis-
I trict coaches convene with Carl Olson,
.head Pitt track coach, and his staff
at the Stadium. After a morning ses-
sion devoted to talks, lectures, dis-
cussions, and moving pictures, the
clinic will attend the second annual
University handicap meet in the
afternoon.

In addition to lectures by Olson on
the subjects of proper starting and
methods of conditioning, Dr. John B.
Sutherland, head football coach, and
James Potts, assistant track tutor,
will also speak. Sutherland’s instruc-
tions will deal with the weight events
while Potts will discuss baton—passing
and the high-jump.

Another feature of the morning ses-
sion will be the showing of motion
pictures of the Pitt trackmen. One
reel will re-enact the scene of the

Ituring that event at the Penn Relays
I last spring.
I The handicap meet will begin at
11:30 o’clock and is an open meet to
all University of Pittsburgh men. The
track teams, both varsity and fresh-
. man, will compete, but they will enter
the events under handicaps of vary-
ing distances. These handicaps were
printed in Tuesday’s issue of the
News. _
It is not yet too late to enter the
meet. Any student wishing to do so
is cordially invited to go immediately
to Coach Olson at the Stadium. Every
effort is being made to encourage the
novice athletes to participate in the
events and it is rumored that Olson
will be very generous with his han-
dicaps in order to make his va.rsity
and freshman outﬁts work for their
ﬁrst places if they are to get them.

ﬁeld clinic seems certain of success,
with 40 replies having been received
early in the week from coaches who
intend to come to the affair. Already
representatives from Erie, Cleveland,
and West Virginia are on the list of
those attending. Olson expects that
his present list will be augmented by
quite a few more coaches when the
clinic opens tomorrow.

VI/'hile the affair is designed prima-
rily for high school and college
coaches, all students are invited to
attend.

The squad will practice every aft-
ernoon in the Stadium, on the basket-

do So_ tional.

The team made a ﬁne showing in,
its ﬁrst AMA competition, which was 
also the team's ﬁrst appearances of thei
season, by tying for the team chain-I
pionship in the Junior class. The
squad may be expected to make a
much more impressive showing in
the coming match, considering theq
fact that practically all of the men
were inexperienced when they entered
the last championship matches. Since

from all appearances, improved the
wrestlers to a considerable extent.

Captain Bradford Ilsley is the only
member of the squad who holds a
Senior AMA title. Ilsley won the 135-

which took place last year. The com-
ing match will mark Ilsley’s ﬁrst de-
