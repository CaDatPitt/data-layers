Obama speaks on  
American Jobs Act

Gretchen Anderson
Staff Writer

President Barack Obama came to
Pittsburgh Tuesday in an effort to
make a last-minute push for the
Americanjobs Act, which the Sen-
ate voted down later that night.

“Today, the Senate of the
United States has a chance to do
something about jobs right now
by voting for the American Jobs
Act,” Obama said at his speech in
South Side as'a crowd of more than
200 audience members erupted
in applause. “This is a moment of
truth for the U.S. Senate.”

Obama arrived in the Steel City '

at 11:15 a.m. to deliver a 20-min-
ute speech pushing for the Ameri-
can J obs Act at the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Local Union No. 5. He spoke to an
audience made up of Pittsburgh
workers, residents and politicians.

Obama also toured the training.

center and met with his Council on
Jobs and Competitiveness for their
third quarterly meeting. u

The president left Pittsburgh at
3:20 pm. to head to Orlando, Fla.,

where he continued the campaign
for his jobs plan.

Despite the president’s two‘

trips, the Senate voted against the
bill 50-49 Tuesday night. To open
debate on the bill,lit would have
required 60 Senate votes.
Obama released a statement

~ following the vote and said that

he will work with Majority Leader
Sen. Harry Reid to pass the indi-
vidual proposals of the jobs plan.

The president said the Pitts-
burgh IBEW plant was “an example
of how if we get a good collabora-
tion between business and labor
and academia, there’s no reason
why we cannot continue to have
the best-trained workers in the
world.”

Obama has visited numerous
cities in the past couple of weeksto
push for the $447 billion American
Jobs Act, which calls for tax cuts
for the middle class and small busi-
ness owners, as well as construc-
tion spending to create jobs.

Republicans oppose multiple
parts of the bill, including the tax
hikes on the upper class and the

rally to

stop  
pipeline  

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Ten Pitt students gathered at a house

on Oakland Avenue at 10 am. They V

proceeded to walk with signs down
to the Birmingham Bridge and pick
up another 40 people. As they trav-
eled across the bridge and down East
Carson Street, more people hopped
into line. . V

By the time the group had reached
Hot Metal Street in South Side at 11
am., nearly 100 people had convened
onthegreen1awntorallyforPresident
Barack Obama to stop construction of
the Keystone XL Pipeline.

The Keystone Pipeline would carry
oil from the Alberta tar sands in Can-
ada 1,700 miles to reﬁneries inTexas.
The Pittsburgh Student Environmental
Coalition, a youth—run organization,
organized the rally Tuesday morning
to coincidewith Obama’s visitto Pitts-
burgh’s South Side. , .

Duringthetwo-hourwalk and rally
in the South Side, the group, which
consisted ofPitt students and student
activists from across the country that
were in Pittsburgh for a sustainability
conference this weekend, held signs
and chantedvarious phrases totryand
gather attention to their cause.

“Hey hey, ho ho, Keystone Pipe-
1ine’s got to go,” and “Save the water,
save the soil, we don’t want your dirty
oil,” were some of the chants coming
fromthe crowd onthelawninbetween
the two‘American Eagle corporation
buildings. The areawas ﬁlledwith city

blocked off Hot Metal Street to allow Obama’s
motorcade to pass.

PittseniorNikkiLuke, anenvironmental stud-
ies and economics major, said that the pipeline
would extract oil from the Alberta tar sands,
which is the second largest carbon deposit in
the world.

Luke, who is also a member of the Pittsburgh
Student Environmental Coalition, said that

Obama is the only person that has the power to A

stop the pipeline.

Seth Bush, a member of Pittfs Free the Plan-
et, said that because the pipeline is such a large
construction project and it crosses international
boundaries, it requires apresidential permit. The
president would submit the permit to the State
Department, which conducts environmental
impact studies that the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency has to approve. It does not have to
go through any legislative bodies, since it isn’t
policy.

Bush said Obama is expectedto makehis deci-
sion on the pipeline by the end of the year.

He saidthatthe rallywaspart of a larger move-
ment happening across the country to protest

the pipeline.

Bush, a senior electrical engineering ma-
jor, was arrested at a similar two—week rally in
Washington, D.C., over the summer, where he
and about 1,300 other demonstrators sat on the
White House lawn to protest the pipeline.

On Nov. 6, more Pitt students and residents

will return to the nation’s capital for the second ,

phase ofthe rally, Bush said. Nearly 2,000 people

have already committed to attend the demon-

stration, where they plan to encircle the White
House and “hopeﬁilly send an even stronger
message, one year before [Obama is] elected
again -— hopeﬁ.Illy,” he said.

As for the Pittsburgh rally, Bush said that it
was meant to send the president a message and
help catalyze the-tar sands movement. He said
thatobamawaved to the demonstrators fromhis
car as it drove past on Hot Metal Street.

“He acknowledged us. That means it’s in his
eye, and that’s the best we can hope for right
now,” Bush said.

For Bush, the pipeline could lead to trouble
for the human race. He said that the pipelinewill
contribute to global warming by adding more

carbon dioidde to the atmosphere.

“It’s really just trouble,” Bush said.

Pitt Greenpeace president Justin Lozano
said that the pipeline is more than just a climate
change issue: It’s also ahealth, safety and human
rights issue. .

He said the pipeline will ruin the communi-
ties it is supposed to run through and destroy
the land.

“It’s affecting all of us in the long term,” Lo-
zano said. ' _

Lozano, a junior psychology and sociology
major, said the rally was meant to promote clean
energyandbeapartofa greater movementwhere
“we could stop Obama from building tar sands
and move towards sustainability and using re-
newable resources.” _

A According to the Transcanada website, the
company behind the Keystone Pipeline project,
operation for the pipeline began injune 2010.
The pipeline will provide the U.S. with a more
stable source of consistent energy supply over
a long period of time and improve U.S. energy

the website. ‘

The website also said that pipelines “are the ,

safest, most reliable, economical and environ-
mentally favorable way to transport oil and pe-
troleum products.” , A A ,

Bush and Lozano said theywillboth still vote

for Obama in2012, even ifhe decides to go ahead

witl1the pipeline — buttheywill not supporthim

Bush saidthatobama made statements when
he was elected that he would campaign for clean
energy, but “ifhe goes through with this, howcan
we trust him?” -
“Howcanwe go out and campaign and knock

_ on doors day after day to get people to vote for

him?” Bush said. "‘Most ofus support Obama,
but we can’t continue to support him if he keeps
making these decisions.”

Luke also said that she wouldn’tbe able to sup-
port him as much as she did in his ﬁrst election.

“We supportedhimin2008.Wewantto sup-
port him in 2012  but we want to supply the

Obama meets with jobs council in South Side

Obama 4 1 .

A way Obama wants to fund the bill.

During his speech, Obama said the focus
for him and the_ 27 members of the Jobs
Council at Tuesday’s meeting was entrepre-
neurship. He commended late Apple CEO
Stevejobs and said “to see the outpouring of
support for him and his legacy tells a story
about what America’s all about.”

Obama stressed the need for legisla- ‘

tion and government spending because of
the state of the economy, saying that the
“economy needs a jolt right now.” V

The president highlighted the fact that

V hundreds of construction and electrical
workers have been laid off and said that the.

workers could repair America’s infrastruc-
ture, including Pittsburgh’s bridges, if the
act were to move forward.
The city’s bridges are 54 years old, which
is .13 years older than the national aver-
age, Obama said. There are almost 6,000
bridges in Pennsylvania that local construc-
tion workers could be rebuilding right now,
he said. Obama said that if the American
Jobs Act was passed, laid—off construction
workers would be hired to work on damaged
infrastructure. 1 "
V “Did you know that more than a quarter
of the bridges in this state are rated struc-
turally deﬁcient?” Obama said. “structurally
deﬁcient — that’s afancy way of saying they
need to be ﬁxed.” A
Obama acknowledged that Republicans
who said they agreed with the ideas in the
jobs plan aren’t keen on passing it because
it would “give [him] a win.” But he refuted
the Republicans’ claim. l

“It’s about giving the American people ‘

who are hurting out there a win, about giv-
ing small businesses, entrepreneurs and
construction workers a win. It’s about giving
the American people, all of us together, a
win,” Obama said as the crowd cheered.

’ The president said that the election is
13 months away, and that Americans “don’t
havethe luxury of waiting 13 months.” He
highlighted the urgency to pass the act to
create jobs now and encouraged political
parties to debate politics -later and focus

Smart thinking:
Noguns at Pitt

Would you feel safer if guns were
allowed on campus?

Last week, the Oregon state
university system decided to al-
low permit holders to bring their
guns onto campus. This raises a
host of concerns, and, in short,
we are glad Pitt has a strict no-gun
policy, regardless of permit.

It’s true that those who will
commit crimes in the ﬁrst place
won’t give Pitt’s policy a second
thought, but we think giving every
individual with a permit the right
to carry a gun on campus would do
more harm than good.

It’s also true that we live, so-
cialize and go' to class in a city.
Thelines between campus and
the city blur in every direction,
and safety is — and should be —
a main concern among students.
At ﬁrst thought, it seems that al-
lowing guns on campus would act
as a deterrent, assist people in
emergency situations and provide
a safer environment for students.
This logic, though, is ﬂawed for
several reasons.

First, a gun has the potential to

kill. Only allowing permit holders ‘

to carry them doesn’t take away
this crucial fact. Mistakes can hap-
pen. When you allow potentially
lethal weapons to enter a large,
crowded space, the probability of
injury skyrockets. And when those
weapons are in the hands of college
students and not professionals, the
odds of safety look dismal.

That brings us to our next
point: The college lifestyle simply
does not mix with weapons that
can kill. Alcohol, when mixed with
immaturity and emotional young

T brains, is dangerous byitself.

Add a gun and an argument could
turn deadly. And with the typical
Pitt student’s stressful lifestyle of

classes, work and being away from
home, tension often runs thick.
Allowing guns on campus could
even increase the number of stu-
dent suicides. <
Imagine a gunshot reverberat-
ing through your freshman dorm.
It could be an attack or a drunken

. resident, but we don’t think it re-

ally matters. We don’t know about
you, but we’d be scared for our
safety. Allowing guns on campus
gives freedom to some, but re-
stricts many. Bringing guns onto

V campus dispels fear for some, but

terriﬁes many. We don’t think the
potential beneﬁts — such as the
ability to act violently and quickly
in emergency situations and more
freedom for those who choose to
carry guns — would be helpful
enough, frequently enough.

Instead of taking notes from
Oregon, we view the state’s deci-
sion as a cautionary tale. Andiwe
don’t think allowing guns onto
Pitt’s campus would deter crime
in the ﬁrst place. People would
still get mugged; houses would still
get burglarized. Permitting guns
on campus wouldn’t auto_mati-
cally make everyone on campus
skilled with ﬁrearms. The people
who would be attacked would be
those who aren’t expected to be
packing heat.

Instead of championing a pos-
sibly destructive cause in order to
stay safe, we think Pitt students
should embrace the University’s
policy. Use common sense: Travel
in groups, stay in well—lit areas and
always have a way of contactin
emergency help. -

_ Sure, guns don’t jump out of
-holsters and kill people, but allow-

. ing guns onto our campus and into

untrained or inexperienced hands
would be a deadly measure. I

Modern history has laid out a sure-
ﬁre path to a life without a smidgen
of struggle or effort —- being born

. into awealthy and powerful family of '

Texas oil magnates. But ifthat’s outside

your level of achievement, you might ‘

belstuck taking long bus rides.
Accordingly, if you’re about to inau-
gurate your college bus—riding career
with a visit to your family this holiday
season, you’re undoubtedly spending
your time biting ﬁngernails over the
largely unexplored issue of bus eti-
quette. But no need for frantic worry
— ﬁve tons of steel, diesel and stand-
ing sewage have a low probability of
 muchharm(unless you’re
a pedestrian or your driver collides
with an 18—wheeler). And to ﬁirther
minimizeyour chances of undesirable

bus-ridingconsequences, you’ve been

As aseasonedveteran ofbus travel
withallthe meritbadges and exclusive

countless hours cataloguing the ins

passengers. To be fully stupeﬁed by
my observational’achievements,you’ll
have to wait patiently for the book re-

We always said that taking the bus is

the plastic bathroom door that fails
to keep the porta-potty smell from

value bus riding’s unique forum for

2. Ask people to watch your bag
so you can take a short bathroom
break, and then totally blow them
off. Waiting in line can be horrendous,
and so can being responsible about
your stuff. People who happen to
share these two frustrations should

. travel. That’s because the bus-riding
‘ experience puts on displaythe human

capacity for generosity, aswellas other
humans’ capacity to exploit it. It’s re-
ally a beautiful thing. As the minutes
count down before your bus rolls up,
it’s totally acceptable to ask the person

, standingbehindyou to hold your spot

in line. Assure them with an “It’ll be
quick” and proceed to waste time as
you please (PSPs and GQ magazines
work well for this). Being forced to

weigh competing interests as a line _

starts to move — i.e., by examining
whetherit’s more right to abandon the
tardy requ'ester’s luggage orto stay put,
potentially holding up everyone — is
aninherentlyﬁmmental exercise, and
rushed travelers are always glad to ac-
cept the challenge. Testing people’s
patience at the gate is a great way to
break the ice before spending eight
hours sitting next to them.

MEN’S soccen e

   

Panthers
prepare for  
Backyard Brawl G

_ Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

When the West Virginia men’s
soccer team travels to Pitt to
play at Ambrose Urbanic Field
Wedn_esday, it will mark the ﬁrst

’ time that the Mountaineers have

played at the Panthers’ new Oak-
land home. ,

But because of Pitt’s impend-
ing move to the Atlantic Coast
Conference, this visit from the
rival Mountaineers (6—4—1, 2-1-0
Big East) might also be their last
as a conference foe. .

The 47th edition of soccer’s
Backyard Brawl kicks off at 7 p.m.
Wednesday on Pitt’s upper cam-

pus with major postseason impli-

cations for both programs. West
Virginia and Pitt (4-7-1, 2-1-0 Big
East) are locked in a tie for third
place in the Big East’sj Blue Divi-
sion with six points each.

As Pitt head coach Joe Lux-
bacher put it Saturday, the game
is _“huge.” '

Both teams
points behind Marquette for
ﬁrst place in the division, but
they are also just two points
short of the ﬁnal spot in next
month’s Big East Championship.
Pitt freshman Chu Chu Onyeukwu
said that despite the team’s win-
ning conference record, the Pan-
thers arestill searching for that
elusive 90-minute performance.

“Wejustneed to play a little bit
quicker,” he said Saturday. “We

started really slow in the ﬁrst P

half [against Seton Hall]. Once
we got our legs, we put the game
away, but we need to start a little

. quicker.”

Pitt defeated Seton Hall 2-0
on Saturday.

West Virginia enters‘ Wednes-
day’s game on a high note, having
upset No. 13 Georgetown 1-0 in

4 Morgantown Saturday. Moun-

are three

taineer midﬁelder Uwem Etuk
scored in the 82nd minute to hand
the Hoyas their ﬁrst conference
loss.

Even then, West Virginia head
coach Marlon LeBlanc looked
ahead to the Backyard Brawl.

“We need to move on pretty

l quickly because we’ve got a big

game Wednesday night back in
the race for the Big East,” LeBlanc
said in an interview with Moun-
taineer TV after the game. “Going
out to Pittsburgh and trying to
pick up three points on the road
is of the most importance.” .

“‘“""“"““‘.‘ WW

”We just need

to play a little
bit quicker.”

With consecutive shutouts
from redshirt junior Justin Hol-
mes against Georgetown and Cin-
cinnati, the Mountaineers have

‘ not allowed aigoal in 196minutes

of play.

Kiwi forward Andy Bevin leads

West Virginia with six goals -
-tied for second most in the Big
East — in hisfirst season in North
America.“ ‘ P '

The Panthers have struggled
to generate offense this season,

Matthew Shuck I Staff Photographer

The Pitt men’s soccer team will face West Virginia in the 47th edition of the Backyard
Brawl onwednesday. The Mountaineers lead the series 31-9-6.

Weekly Honor Roll for his effort. ,
Sophomore Nico Wrobel leads the Pan-
thers with ﬁve goals this year, but he hasn’t

scored since a penalty kick goal in a 5-1 loss

to Richmond on Sept. 18. Pitt remains last
in the Big East in goals per game (0.92).

West Virginia leads the all—time se-
ries against the Panthers 31-9-’6, a tally
that dates back to 1962. Pitt last defeated
the Mountaineers in 2000, when the No.
9-ranked Panthers won 1-0 at Shaler Area
High School.‘

West Virginia never lost at Founders
Field, where Pitt played for 10 years before
moving to Ambrose Urbanic Field.

LeBlanc said. he’s looking forward to
moving from the often muddy and chewed
up Founders Field to the synthetic turf at
the Panthers’ new home, which should«al—
low for crisper passes and more chances for
his Mountaineers to create offense.

“We don’t have to play on their rugby
ﬁeld anymore, which ought to be nice,”
LeBlanc said. “I never want to say many
nice things about Pittsburgh, but they’ve
got a nice new facility.” I

On both the women’s and men’s sides,
Pitt and Syracuse will face some extra
hostility when they hit the road in con-
ference play. .

Opposing fans see both schools as vil-

I1
lains for ﬂeeing the Big East and relocating
to the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Notre Dame athletic director Jack
Swarbrick said in a USA Today article that
Pitt and Syracuse were “abandoning” the

conference without notice, blasting both”

schools over the move.

Guess where Pitt men’s basketball will
open its Big East schedule? At the Fighting
Irish on Dec. 27. ‘

The Panthers travel to football schools
West Virginia on Jan. 30, South Florida
on Feb. 2, Louisville on Feb. 26 and Con-
necticut, to conclude conference play, on
March 3. _ _

Pitt also plays at DePaul onjan. 5. The
Blue Demons are 2-52 in the conference
over the past three years, but things are

looking up under head coach Oliver Pur-

nell, who took Old Dominion, Dayton an

_ Clemson to the NCAA Tournament in past

coaching stints.

DePaul returns eight players, includ-
ing Big East Rookie of .the Year Cleveland
Melvin.

‘With St.}ohn’s returning only Stith and
Providence (4-14 in the Big East last sea-
son) losing league-leading scorer Marshon
Brooks, the Blue Demons have an excellent
shot at staying out of the basement for the
first time since_2008. I ‘
