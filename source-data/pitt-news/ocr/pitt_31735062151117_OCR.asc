' At the weekly a-ssem‘b_ly‘last Thurs-

the ‘Insurance Ca‘mpaign‘which is -be-
ing‘ carried on for the University,-
spoke to the faculty and students -in
Memorial Hall. ' ‘ ‘ - I
. T. I-I. CB. McKnight, chairman of
this .movement,? -made _ a few. general
irémarks regarding thefadvisability of
the plan, paving the way for the more
explanatory remarks ‘of A. St. Peter,
the originator and executive secr’etary
of the movement. " ,  '
This‘ plan, according: to ' Mr. St;
Peter, if worked riglitly, will solve all
‘of Pitts’ future ﬁnancial’ probllerns.
The idea is to have eacﬂ Pitt student,
all the Seniors, anyway, ‘and’ all grad-
uates_ take but ha‘ policy in favor of
Pitt, the premiums amounting, in all,
to a little irnoryeithianp five hundred dol-
i3.I'S, paid in small periodical sums. A
detail which was not generally known,
came to light through Mr. St. Peter’s
remarks, when he explained 110W. by-
utilizngi a small dividend left each
year from every policy, aisinking fund
might be‘ started, thereby-enabliingthe
-committee to finish paying on lapsed
policies. " .  .
In '---twenty or thirty years ._ a
permanent endowment will have -been
started to perpetuate Pitt, and enable.
each student and graduate to repay.

“permitted to go visiting several b-unks - '
away. without ‘taking one.

The c1.oser we get ‘to ‘the, actual
ﬁghting, the"more unreal. does the ,
,wh’-‘ole business ‘seem. H When we first v - ‘
sighted the English coast-some ofthe
fel.low.~s "remarked. that it seemed..f
strange that weiwere a-bv_ou.t to land in 
a country which was participating in]
the great "struggle and which had
given up so many ofits mein ‘already.
Then another remarked: “Why you’
have just lefta country which. is’ also‘,
participating in thisiwar and ’which\is
about to sacriﬁce many of itsacitiziens, E 
if necessary.” And it -seemed stranger» 
than ever. i @i_ , - 

We hung outside of an English,
harbor trill dark, and then ‘went in-
through a narrow lane, marked‘ by
buoys which ‘bore red and? green
lights and whose bells clanged as the.
waves rocked them. ,A group: of us .
were standing on deck ‘watching the A
buoys ﬂit by ., and” listening to them A
ringing. One remarked, “Oh, see the
bu-.oysi;’.’ another, “Yes, they are «bell-A
buoys;”' and still another, “Even.
waves must tip the bellbuoys.” .

We got off the ship at daybreak. and _
soon after embarked on an English
train, oriwhat the English people call‘ "
strains. I They are’ fragile looking
things, and freight cars like pony
carts. England seems _twenty; years
behindithe times, and it was the ggeat
delight of all the boys to tell English-,,
men -so. ’ “ , pg‘. —

Iinsiurain'ce Endowment

 Scovel, -’»83, Is Speaker

at Monday Meeting of .Com-
. paign ‘Workers’. '

PQINTS ,-MADE CLEAR
Over ‘a quarter million dol-

lars- of endowment as a result
of the .ﬁ,1'st week’sr“drive”» for

A the University Insurance En-

dowment Fund was reported at

 the ‘weekly meeting of the
~ .?'workers. held at the Union Ar-

cade Monday -. morning. This
moneycame from a totalof

«  subscribers and represented
,  “amounts from $1,000 to $30,000.

'I‘he’, name of. the subscriber to
the last named amount was not

‘ given and it will be the policy

' - of the Joint Committee to pub-
lish ‘no names and‘.amounts_ to-\
"gether during the progress ‘of
‘the carnpaign. _There was also
. ‘- .' _- "one subscription of $20,000 and
_ 'one‘of’$l5,000. A half dozen

' >,$l0,,00O’s were reported and a

like number of $5,000’s. The
balance’ covered $2,000 ’ and
$1,000. Letters were read from

»a number of alumni who “did
:their,_bit,” one coming from a
_loyal “grad” who resides in

Rh_od‘eg..Island. All these gave

i.gre,a-t, encouragement to the

‘_.workers, who were enthusiastic

_"_ivli_en the report was made.

._ Thefispeakers were Charles VV.

 ‘Scovel, '83, former president of the
' " General Alumni Association and a ria-
‘ tional authority onlife insurance, and

Albert St. Peter (Assoc. Econ.), Ex-

 jecutive Secretary, theman who origi-
*  nated the plan of raising endowignent

for the University through ‘this plan.
Mr. S_covel’s remarks were directed

..vv«ill be furnisli<;d..._to' all -the me7n‘“~e~nT-
gaged in the campaign.’

., 0 _ A “Mass Movement”

4 He told the workers that the cam-
paign for endowment should be con-
sidered as a “mass movement” on the
part of the alumni, in which everyone
was expected to do his partias a mem’
ber of an organization rather than

doing it individually. .He stated that
"the pl-an of raising endowment for

an educational institution such as
{Pitt through insurance was a new one,
although at ‘Williams ‘College and
other institutions the Seniors took out
insuran-ce policies, with. their Alma
Mater as. the beneficiary,‘ with as

. ‘muchregularity as they receiveditheir
- sheepskins.‘ He predicted that after
. the success of the Pitt campaign is

ﬂashed over the country the plan is

isurie to be taken up by_ many insti-

tutions.
3.The speaker cited some of the"ob-

'3 jiections which the workers were sure

t_o encfounter as they met the alumni.
Some, he said, would state they are
-too old to take out insurance and

jsome would say they are uninsur-

able. These men, he stated, -could
turn over existing policies, changing
the beneﬁciary to the University, or
.they,ca'n payipremiurns on policies
which can be taken out for other
.individuals, these‘ being chosen either
by the alumnus or by the University

“BILL” ARTHER ~.
  OFF FOR FRANCE

The following letter has come from
VV. C. Art_her, '17, dated November

20th:

“Just a. line, for I am rushed. By
the time..you get this, I will be on my
way ‘over there‘ where so many of. my
fellow Pittites are -now. Besides my-
self, George Ketchum and Pyle, Mines
’17, are here. I graduated two weeks
ago at Columbus and received my cer-
tiﬁcate. It read ‘graduated with honors‘
which made me feel pretty good. Please
send my WEEKLY to ‘Aviation Corps,
Signal Corps, A. E. F. via New York
Ciu/.’ Remember me .to all thefollows.
Congratulations to the team, Pop War-
ner and the rest.”

Arther and Ketchum, two ofthe
livest wires and ﬁnest characters that
Pitt ever produced, both entered the
aviation service somemonths ago a'nd
did their training work, as stated, at
Columbus. They'are_sure to make
gbod in this departmezig of the serv-i

anyone who ever enrolled here. It is
not surprising to -‘hear that he “grad-
uated with 'honors”.at.Columbus. He
had the‘ habit of doing that in every-'
thing he undertook. ' A

George Ketchum was formerly sec-
retary to Chancellor McCormick, at
the same, time pursuing work in the
School of Economics. He is a mem-
,ber of the famous Ketchum family of
boosters-three of the four of,them
already ‘being in the_ service. Kenneth
is at Augusta, Ga.-, and Francis is at
-Cape May.- A .

The Secretary came-in close con.-
tact with both Arther and Ketchum
when they handled the .publicity, work
for thegfootball team, and he‘-learned
to love and -admire them. He joins
with all Pitt men in wishing them
God-speed in their journey “over
there.” '

Committee. In the latter case, if the
man insured lives longer than the
alumnus who pays the premium,“ the
A~Univer_:si_tY,;, :h?~S-.m'adA1e' - A

  
  
  

_  . woo Risk) .. _

‘Speaking of the war risk, Mr.'Scovel
stated that if the alumnus, in case he
is called to service, does not feel able
to pay the “extra warpremium,” ‘the
University can pay it out of its funds.
II the “extra” is not paid, the policy
will ‘remain in force if the.r.e’gular
premium only—is paid, and in case of
death during the period of the‘ war
the beneﬁciary will get the total
amount of premiums paid in. At the
end of the war the policy becomes
effective again for the ‘full amount.
It was pointed out in this connection
that statistics of the war thus far
show that 14 out of every 15 -called
come back and that only one of every
10 or 15 is called to service. _\

Mr. Scovel outlined therspecial pur-
poses to which the alumni of the vari-
ous schools could have their endow-
ment applied. The School of Phar-
'macy is anxious, for instance, to-have
a building “On the Schenley Farms
campus, and Dr. J. A. Koch,'Dean of
that,School, has addressed a special
letter to all his former students, urg-

Law Department alumni, _many of
whom are graduates of other colleges
and universities and who naturally
-look on their law studies at Pitt in

be urged to subscribe with the idea

sors for that School. In "this way
they will be showing a loyalty to
Pit_t as well as_to their profession.
The Medical and Dental Schools need
bu'ildings andendowment. _

The ﬁnal important point empha-
sized by thespeaker was this:

IT ‘Is NOTLA MATTER or
WAITING FOR DEATH PRO-
CEEDS. (INEVITABLE AS 
ARE,IN ANY LARGE GROUP OF
INSURED PERSONS), BUT IM-
MEDIATELY _0N PUTTING THE
INSURANCE IN FORCE THE
UNIVERSITY HAS A ‘STRONG
CREDIT BACKING AND YEAR
"BY YEAR ‘A GROWING CASH
SINKING FUND—BOTH OF
WHICH SOON FORM A BASIS
FOR ‘FINANCING PRESENT
NEEDS.

this. _ J »,

Lieut-. Joseph B. Gold, Med. '14 (First
Lieut. M. O. R. C.), is with -the 129th
Field Arnbulance, British Expeditionary
Force. Served for a while with‘ the
Britiﬁi troops in Belgium during a
heavy bombardment. One German
“Mi le" burst at the mouth of his
dug 1, almost ﬁlling it. Fortunately,
at the‘ time he was in the front. line
dressing station. He y at present
somewhere in France .with the Field
Ambulanipe and not behind in a base

Lieut's. Marcy and Fredette (class-

Lieut. Marcy and Lleut. Fredette

were together for a. while, but became
separated. ‘ L‘ieut.
Gold have met twice in France. °

Dr. Fredette had a. very interesting
time, crossing the Atlantic, as his
transport was chased by submarines.
He was rather interested, in them at
the time.

You were probably aware or the fact
that these Pitt Alumni are in the serv-

stated in the notice from the Boalt

‘The committee ‘believes that to attain

DEBATING TEAM
IHOLDS MEETING,

‘The candidates for’ the debating
team met last Friday evening in room
204 State Hall and discussed in an
informal manner a topic which had
been previously assigned. The at-
tendance at that meeting was not very
great, and, as Professor Lane desires
every candidate to get‘ a fair -trial for
the team, he deferred the, ﬁnal chioos-_
ing of the men for the debating
squads until a -future date. However,
the following teams were‘ chosen to
debate at the next meeting, which will
be held on_the 7th of December:

For the affirmative side of the ques-
tion are Team, No. 1, Ward and Gri.f-
