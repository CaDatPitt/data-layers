Evaluates AAUP

Don F. Saunders

Dl’l‘0R: of the Alumni Review, who

in today’s issue defends the" Amer-
ican Association of University Profes-
sors although attacking the __“Turner
Report.”

AAUP Discussed
In New Review

 

Saunders Considers Turner Case
In Alumni Publication

“What is the AAUP?” a ve1'i:i11enl:
question to University alumni and as-
sociates, is commented upon by Don
F. Saunders, editor of the Alumni Re-
view, in the Fe‘bruary-March edition,
mailed to members of the General
Alumni Association yesterday.

Characterizing the public reaction
to the preliminary report issued 011
the Turner case by the sub—con1mitte'e
of three professors as “erroneous and
generally 11IlC0l1‘_pll.llleI1l‘.3.l'y impres-
sions of the purposes and functions of
the AAUP,” Saunders takes the stand
defendi-ng the‘ association.

I-lowever, he believes the digression
in the report which criticizes the in-
dustrial and social life of Pittsburgh
“violates the spirit of impartial scien-
tiﬁc investigation” and for that rea-
son “the organization can hardly a.f-
ford to endorse the preliminary re-
port.”

About the local membership of the
association Saunders says, “The local
membership includes some of the
most competent and highly regarded
individuals on the staff.”

The major part of the article is
taken up with a listing of the body of
statements of the AAUP regarding
academic freedom and tenure which
are, in the opinion of the editor, fair
and reasonable.

Dr. John A. Nietz, associate pro-
fessor of education, discusses, “Penn-
sylvania’s policy for aiding higher
education.” He claims the state's
past policy of appropriations has com-
mitted them to a deﬁnite policy in
aiding certain non-sectarian universi-
ties.

CPSF Accepts New Constitution
To Re-Establish I-F Council

 

CPSF took the easiest way out Tues-
day night and by the simple accept-
ance of a. constitution made itself In‘-
tert‘raterni.ty Council.

To those who observed Interfrater-
nity Council taking the hard way out
last May, Tuesday’s meeting wasa
decidedly tame milestone in. the-
rough rutted road of interfraternit_y
government. '

The new constitution, passed by a
12-1 vote, provides for election of of-

-ﬁcers by the Hare system of prefer-

ential ballot, allows every frate1'nity
member voting rights, establislies a
ﬁve-man executive board with the four
highest in the voting holding the con-
ventional offlces and calls for elec-
tions the latter part of this month.

Otherwise, most of the essential
features of previous I--F’ Council con.-
stitutions are retained.

today.

In addition to investigating acad-
emic freedom the committee has more
than a passing interest in how the
University is spending the money it
receives from the State and will call
upon the Chancellor for detailed sta-
tistics on that score.

The connniitee is also considering

student, while not a inember of the

by Represc-rntative Eugene A. Capuiﬂ.
chairman, to marshal Liberal spokes-
men.

“We will try to keep the testimony
brief and concise in order not to waste
any time.” Caputo said. “We will not
permit duplication of testimony,” he
added, explaining the committee was
anxious to conclude its investigation
as quickly as possible so that its rec-
ommendation may be made without
de]a.v to the House Appropriations
committee. '

The committee has received sever-
al requests to investigate the ﬁnancial
condition. of the Stadium, but at pres-
ent Caputo is reluctant to step into
that avenue of investigation.

“Our main purpose.” he explained,
“is to ﬁnd out whether or not Liberals

Laughlin Boosts
Company Unions

Steel Strike Promoted To Show
Labor Power, Attorney Says

Company unions in preference to
national labor unions was the point
of-view taken by John E. Laughlin at
the weekly meeting of Inquiry forum,
VVednesday.

Mr. Laughlin contended that the
ﬁrst place a national union attempts
to organize a branch is in “contented”
inclustiy. Officials, he said, organize
strikes but the laborers do not know
iwhat they are striking for.

Commenting on the recent strike in
the \Neirt0n plants, Mr. Laughlin, who
was one of the defending attorneys for
the VVeirton Steel company in its
Delaware action, said:

“The object of the strike in the
VV'eirton company, a strike promoted
by national labor unions, was only to
show the "force of the labor union and
had no particular beneﬁt for the em-
ployees.”

He. listed three functions of col-
lective baigainiiig:
(xi) getting employees together,

ironing out differences and deciding
upon grievances; (2) presenting
grievances to the management; (3)
1i.e::.'otiating with the employer.

The advantage of company unions
over national organizations, was that
they represent the laborer more di-
rectly and have his interests more at
heart, Mr. Laughlin maintained.

Three Jobs Oflered

Plaintiffs To Minimize Turner
Case, Friends Of Former

The lone;-l1ei.'al.ded University
investigation —— with two “sur-

t1fy——begins at ll) o’clock today
in the City Co11.11ci.l chambers."

Chancellor John G. Bowman re-
ceived official notiﬁcation of the
hearing _vesterda_v.

Testimony is expected to be offered
by Dr. Colstou E. Vvarne, former eco-
nomics instructor here, and Fred A.
W'oltma.u, former assistant in philoso-
phy———both of whom left the Univer-
sity during the Liberal club expul-
sions in 1929.

yesterday from the East,

Friends of Dr. Ralph E. Turner,
ousted history professor, said he prob-
-‘ll)1.V would not be called for several
days. They indicated “the Turner
case” would be presented as only one
in a series of incidents in the allesr.-:«.l

pala and Homer S‘. Brown. I-’ittslnzrgli;

Lovett, Tra.ii'ord.

The committee late yesterday still
had received no appropriation. Just
how many witnesses it will subpena
without having funds for expenses
is uncertain.

Dr. Ralph E. Himstead of Syracuse
university. chairman of the committee
of the Association of University Pro-
fessors which criticized the Chancellor
recently, is expected to appear after
Dr_ Turner is called.

The legislative committee will not
have counsel, it was indicated yester-
day. The University is expected to
be represented either bv C. F". C.
Arensberg or James S. Crawford, at-
torneys. -

J. Alfred W'ilner, Pittsburgh attor-
ney, will be counsel for plaintiffs
against. the University.

The hearing——according to a recent
statement by Representative Brown——
will be public and open to anyone

this I7nivcrsit_v denied by its action the principles of free opinion and
free communicz’:tion upon which the Coinmoiiwcalth is fo'undcd?”
Their decision may affect the University for a. decade.

By a simple act of definition, however, t.l1esc five men may have
an inﬂuence beyond this University, beyond the Turner case, and
beyond the p1'c.:-ciit years.

‘We mean that they should lay down a. cont.e1nporar_v definition
of academic freedom. Before a single witness is questioncd, the
("ap-11to conimittce should offer a Bill of Academic Rights. And the
connnittec’s deﬁnition should be embodied in their report to the Gen-
~;-ral Assembly.

If they answer the following qucstions—-or questions similar in
purposc—they will cstablisli a worltablc standard for higlicr educa-

szthte his opinion frankly and openly, provided that: he also presents
the other sides of the question; that he provides the students, as far
as })0f:'.SllJl9, with all the pertinent and available facts; and that he
encourages them to c *aluate for themselves and to suspend judg-
mcntuntil they have examined all the available and pertinent facts?

6. In time of war, should instructors who oppose war be barred

7. In order ‘to safeguarcl democrac_v and academic freedom in the

mainly of bankers, manufacturers, corporation lawyers and big-busi-

representative classroom teachers and representative alumni?

, Students And War

HE VVORLD seems in some daiigcr of rcpeatrin.,o.' the same old
tragic patterns today, as statesmen from the iittcry chanccllorics
of Europe prepare to tralnp. at Stresa, ainong the dusty shades of
Napoleon Bonapartc’s one-time headouarters. In Europe the will
for peace, in spite of the repeated efforts of educational and social

'ag'encics, is being lost in the fear of war, with its inherited train of
‘ﬁillpld international teclmiques.

Meanwhile, among‘ American students, is a. sigmiﬁcant clearing
of heads. In appropriate war protest demonstrations and assemblies
all over the country next. Friday, more than 100,000 university stu-
dents are expected to declare, by their action, their determination to
find"'a"vva_v out. Approximately 100,000 will be declaring their dis-
inclination to die for markets, oil, treaties and blather. I

At the University, there can be no better expression of the dc-
terminaticn to join with intelligeiit forces in America towards cud-
ing war than a united abandonment of classes, by students and in-
structors, cl111'in0; an hour next Fridav. The University administration
could not do better than to arrange for good speakers to address stu-
dents and instructors who want. to listen. The success of petitions,
signed Vlledncsday by more than a hundred in a few minutes, indi-
cates that students will listen.

After all. except the advocat.es—-like Mussolini—of the moral
virtues of warfare and the uplifting inﬂuences of slaiigrlitcr, who is
there who can see any good, or use, or beauty in war—this ﬁfth day
of April, 1935?

Can Poetry Survive?

MONG the casuals of the machine age, along with horses and
three-hours-for-lunch, has been that .i'amous old commodity,
poetry. According to all the best indications, poetry has abandoned
the field of truth to science. and handed over the business of criticiz-
ing life to sc.icnt.iﬁc experts.

Its present state, according to all the best authorities. rescnibles
:: sort of .Ra.bylon.ish captivity among; the Cummin,<2fs, Steins and
Joyccs, while people who once would have turned to writers like
Dante and Whitman for solutions of their problems now turn to
psycliologists.

This state of thing's no doubt weighs upon Mr. I-Ierbcrt Hoover,
who, within memory, called for a great poem to lift his country and
his party out of the slough of despond. This running to the psy-
c.l1olo,Q'ists doubtless depresses also the proletarian artists who hope
to write the poem that will blast Mr. Hoover and his party out of the
American scheme. But the shades of Li Po and Shakespeare, not to
mention those young Englishmen who were just under ground :1
hundred years 29:0, will rest. easy to hear that Dante is done for; to
hear one, Max Eastman, declare:

.C“Pure poetry has a great future. To realize that future, it must
discard; the present techniques of the meaningless manipulations of
words. It must fulﬁll its purpose as the ‘Ode to Autumn’ fulﬁlls its
purpose, by adding to the data of wisdom.”

April Fool Has Its Joke
Three To A Glass

By ROMAN LAPICA

Cannonballs On the Loose!

The Boys of ’65 are marching again.

Today, several days after the (le-
spicable trick, guards at Soldiers’
Memorial hall are still up in arms and
scouring the immediate district for
the enemy.

He is the one or more who under
cover of darkness swiped four of the
hall's 100-pound cannonballs, then
dropped two of them in the bushes,
carrying off‘ the other pair. ’

Said Matthew MacDonald, 38-year-
old Civil war veto1'an,worl-ting in the
hall: i

“College students are always ini.
ti-sting each other. But this time
it looks serious. Whoever took the
balis had better return them.”

“Your old cannonballs are back of

Sure enough, the balls were there.
One of the veterans said’ he suspects

Pitt's New Song

Geo1':.*,e Olsen, radio and dance l){-1ll.(l

song for Pitt. It was presented to the
’Univc1-si’;._v last week. Here are the
two stziiizzis:

Break ’em up-—down-—up—and—-

Fight ’em off their feet, boys,

Fight for dear old Pitt.

Sweep ’em out of the way, boys,

Dear old Pitt must win.

$6~To Harrisburg

Why no’: take next Tuesday off
and visit Harrisburg for the city
manager hearing?

According to Edward O. Tabor,
chairman of the Civic club. of Alle-
gheny county, $6 will see you there
and back.

The hearing before the Miuiicipal
House conunittee will seek to deter-
mine whether Pittsburgh should or
shouldn't go city-manager.

Trains will leave here about 8 a. m.
and return after 9 in the evening.

Supporters of the plan who will
speak at the hearing include Dr. lila-

departmcnt, W'i1liam A. Magoo, city
councilman, and P. T. Fagan, head of
the Central Labor union.

April Fool Has its Joke

It was an accident, of course, that
it liappcned on April Fool’s Day, but
the Panther staff doesn’t think so.-
yet.

One of the staff was looking through
the desk in the ofﬁce when she ran

across the official minute book of the '

old Student Council of last year.

The names were interesting, the
minutes were more so, but the jewel
of the collection was a sheet of ‘paper
on the top with the words:

“May I take you home tonight?”

Said 3 Panther:

“No wonder Council fell. Remem-
ber Rome!”

Three to a Class
P1‘.tt’s smallest engineering depart-
ment will send out three men this
June.

Physics and Er.gineering—begun in
1.931——today has eight majors. It isn’t
listed as a school. It hasn't the
s-tcttus of a bureau. It’s a department
all riglit, called a. course by students.

But every graduate is working.

The three seniors are Henry H.
George, of Stanton Heights, James M.
Wallace, North Braddock, and Peter
L. Vissat, Bridge-ville.

None ll:.l.S a job lined up as yet, but
there are three possibilities:

Electrical engineering, teaching col-
logo physics and lnathematical or re-
search work.

Also unique among courses is the
fact that P11 & E has two heads—Dr.
Archie G. Worthing, head of the phy-
sics department, and Howard E.
Dyche, head of the electrical engineer-

ing department.

have been ‘suppressed at Pitt.”

Caputo, a graduate of the Univer-
sity Law school, Class of 1925, has
taken over practically the entire ma-
chiner_v of the investigation himself.
One of the hardest working legisla-
tors at the Capitol, the Beaver county
attorney is also a member of the
House Liquor Investigating committee
and part of the Democratic “VVar
Board” guiding the administration
bills through the House and over to
the hostile Republican Senate.

Some members of the House believe
the Pitt investigation will develop
more pyrotechnics than was antici-
pated by David L. Lawrence. Demo-
cratic State chairman, and others who
pushed the resolution for the probe.
For this reason Speaker VVilson G.
Sarig was h2u'd-pressed for a while un-
til he ﬁnally corraled enough ‘investi-
gators. Several of those approached
were unwilling to accept appointment
to the committee because of the be-
lief the investigation may develop
many 1'an1ilicatl~:)11s and drag on at
length.

\Vhat with politics coming up, the
Betas, Independents, Alphas and what
nots are being conjured up with
cliques and hushed whispers again.

Among the solid fronts already
built up is the Beta.-Independent. group
which at present is supporting Frank
Fredericks, which is in turn a cold
shoulder to another fellow, for taking
a. College Association petition. Noth-
ing like politics to stir the blood, suh.

-Politically speaking, many of the
“inastute" campus leaders are doing
some tall thinking on why Charlie
Herald stomped and stormed so vehe-
mently for Don Campbell when he
was still 11 candidate for his present
position, chairman of the Senior Ball.
Get out of the Right Center party,
Chucky boy; declare yourself.

It pays to be the ,9.ir1-friend of a
real big wig in SFA. One girl friend
of a. high b'ggy-wig hasbeen appoint-
ed to all Senior committees.

‘One enterprising school, after hear-

pittpourri '

ing of the WSGA publication on col-
lege etiquette, wrote to Miss Rush
asking for a copy of-her Puss}-'—Cat.
“. . . .thy will be done."

Pitti-paw not to be confused with
Pittiquette, for Pitti-paw’s etiquette
wasn't quite proper. And that dear
readers is why Pitti-paws will never
read Pittiquette, for Pitti-paws ate
birdies. And eating birdies is not
proper in etiquette. So, Pitti-paws is
gone, 01‘. as they say in Heinz House,
“properly disposed of.” (Hist, villain.
an inﬁnitive). ed note: You ﬁgure
it out.

A story going the rounds and told
us by a former columnist, concerns a
radio a Phi Gam bought for a. frater-
nity girl and which he is still paying
for. And is the girl laughing? It is
it good radio.

One picture of the Senior queen
nominees was taken on a cannon on
Soldiers’ Memorial bldg. lawn. The
cannon wasn’t shown in the picture.
Maybe they are afraid of April 12.

The Fiji served notice on the

According to a survey of Student
chest ﬁles, 631 stucleiits have not as
yet‘, =;'ultilled their pledges.

Out of a total of approxiinately $2,-
000 pledged to the fund last Novem-
ber, $521.20 still remains outstanding.

The checkup reveals that men stu-
dents are more lax in paying their
pledges tlian women. A group of 447
owes a total of $264.35.

On the other hand, 184 women stu-
dents pledged a total of $156.85. This
averages about 85 cents per person;
men students average slightly less.

Varsity Golf Team To Open Season
With Western Reserve Tomorrow

 

VVit.li two weeks of practice behind
them, the Panther varsity golfers
swing into action tomorrow afternoon
against the crack Western Reserve
sextet at Cleveland. \Vestern Reserve
is represented this year by practically
the same team which copped the indi-
vidual Eastern Intercollegiate cham-
pionship last Yhar.

The Pitt team, which last year won
the Eastern Intercollegiate team cham-
pionship, is intact with the exception
of Claude M,cKee_. who is ineligible for
further competition because of the
three year ruling.

Captaui Regis Vvolff will be the
number one man for the Panther links-
men, while the number two position
will be held down by Art Mathews or

Jack Vfasco. The remainder of the
team of si:-' men to make the trip will
be chosen. .f_i'oni-the following men;
Paden Gamble, l\'Ic-rry Rosenbloom,
Joe Bryan, Bob Mease, and Ed Doran.

The match with Western Reserve
is the first for the Pitt stick-wielders
on a. schedule which includes 20 op-
ponents and four out of the state
duals. In the other out-of-state
inatu-lies Syracuse will be met at Syra-
:-.=_ise, Notre Dame at South Bend and
the University of Detroit at Detroit.

Individual 18 hole matches will be
played with the lowest aggregate
score determining the team winner.
The Panthers will leave by automo-
bile tomorrow morning and will re-
turn to Pittsburgh Sunday.

Cats Get Back

 To Cage Drills

For Beach Battle

The sun, it appears, never sets on
the Pitt basketball season.

Just when all colleges and univer-
sities are tiiriiiiig their attentions to
spring football, tennis, track, golf and
the like, the Pitt basketball squad is
going gack on the job up at the stadi-
iiin pavilion,

This time they're preparing for the
“Battle of the Beach” at Atlantic City
next Saturday evening. The fact that
the Pantliers are to meet/Louisiana
State, iiudefeated champions in the
Soiitlieastern con1‘erence, makes it al-
most a certaiifty that there will be a.
battle of some considerable dimen-
sions.

The Aineric-an Legion, sponsor of
this ﬁrst cage affair of its kind, is ex-
pecting 20000 fans to turn out in the
resort city’s Auditorium to watch the
game. The Legion officials also ex-
pect that Huey P. Loug, the Senatorial
gentleman from Louisiana, will toss
