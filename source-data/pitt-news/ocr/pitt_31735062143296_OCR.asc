News Agency Men
Find Prosperity
Around Corner

Eleven men students of the Uni-
versity rounded the corner re-
cently and captured elusive Pros-
perity. According to a report re-
leased by Chester B. Bennett of
the student Employment Bureau,
$89.00 worth of magazines at spe-
cial subscription rates have been
soldby these representatives of
the Student News and Periodical
Agency of the University. Orders
netted the men $32.75, or almost
three dollars per man. Of 38 or-
ders taken, 35 have been obtained
since the ﬁrst of the year, and
the ﬁrst order was dated Decem-
ber 7.

All orders thus far have been
obtained outside of the Univer-
sity, no faculty members having
subscribed, although they have
been informed of the enterprise
and have exhibited and stated
their desire to cooperate with the
students as far as possible.

The Agency reports that it is
desirous of having a few more
students apply to the office for
order blanks and take advantage
of this proposition.

Subscriptions to any magazine,
foreign or otherwise, are available
through the Agency. Morton Har-
ris, Col. ’36, is chairman of the
Agency.

Women Hear
McKoWn Talk

Influence on Society

“V'\"oma.n, from time immemorial,
has been ridiculed, burlesqued, cir-
cumscribed. and limited
ideals, attitudes, and activities, but
during the past one hundred and ﬁfty
Iyears she has been successful in
throwing oﬁ the shackles that have
bound her and 1S now entering a. po-
sition in which she will have more in-
ﬂuence on the fundamental elements
of society than man will ever have,”
sophomore women were told by Dr.
Harry C. McKown, prot'essor of edu-
cation. at a.n assembly at Heinz
House last Monday.

Dr. McKown, in outlining the
things that he would do if he were
a college girl, stressed nine points.
These points advised, in brief, that
the college woman should diagnose
herself, prepare deﬁnitely for some
activity, seek the assistance of pa-
rents and friends, try to be herself,
be tolerant of other individuals, be
modern but not extreme, plan not to
marry hurriedly of too soon and “be
sure that her husband is well insur-
ed,” remember that the woman is far
more responsible-for the -setting of all
kinds of social standards than man,
and ﬁnally, keep growing, for a diplo-
ma does not represent education, but
only the possible beginning of it.

The Monday assembly was the first
of a. series to be given for the women
of the sophomore class. Monthly as-
semblies with speakers will be given
for the remainder of the year. ‘Wo-
men of other classes are invited to,
attend all these assemblies.

Second semesters fraternity rush-

Iothers who have attained a twelve

?will be eligible. ‘

From the opening of the rushing
period early Friday morning until the
[beginning of the silence period the
grushees will be treated to an unlimited
Inumber of social events as the frater-
nity men compete for new pledges.

Restrictions on the number of
events that fraternities are allowed
to stage have been removed, follow-
ing the course pursued during the
first semester’s rushing in October,
}but despite this fact rushing events
Iwill largely take the form of imper-
‘sonal theater parties and small events.
Council's ruling that no fraternity is
allowed to give a dance on any night
other than Friday or Saturday will
affect the number of major events to
be scheduled.

Coincident with the close of rush-
ing season, the silence period will be-
gin, during which time no member of
a fraternity will approach or talk to
a. newly registered student nor any
‘persons who have been rushed for
fratiernities. Violations of: the silence
period rules and the regulations gov-
erning the rushaing period caused :the
censure of three campus fraternities
following the rush period last semes-
ter.

All invitations to pledge to frater-
nities will come through the otlice of
the dean of men and no invitation
may be issued otherwise, Sealed bids
;for students whom they wish to in-
Ivite to pledgcship must be turned in

Selected For
Frosh Play

As a result of the’ tryouts for
the freshman dramatic unit's first
play, “Mothers on Strike,” a one’-
act comedy-drama by Karl Web-
ster Pierce, to be given tentative
ly February 14, the following cast
was selected from a group of
twenty-four aspirants: Mrs. Stan-

 

ton will be played by Frances
Goodwin, Mr. Stanton‘, Ola .Mc-
Grail; Ruth Stanton. Roberta

Nern; Mr. Vvarren, Sylvia/"vFixel;
Mrs. Warren, Ruth Sites; ‘Bob
Stanton, Edna Miller.

The plot of the play deals with
a mother whose ungrateful chil-
dren have led her to conspire with
a neighbor in order to ﬁnd some
means of making them realize
her importance. The action winds
up with everyone agreeing that

Of Mining Treatise
ls Uncovered

 

The department of
sesses a valuable translation by Pres-
ident and Mrs. Hoover of the original
treatise by Georgius Agricola on "De
Re Metallica."

The original book was written in‘
Latin by Georgius Agricola, as he’

was called in the Latin language, al-
though, his real name was George
Bauer. The treatise was printed in
1556; about a. century after the intro-
duction of th.e printing press.

that was of any importance for about
two hundred years. Mr. Bauer was a.

many.

“Dc Re Metallica” was translated
from the first Latin edition, by Presi-
dent Hoover and his wife, while they
were living in London. Their trans-
lation took about ﬁve years to com-
plete and was ﬁnally published in
.1912. Although the task was at-
tempted by several others, the trans-
lation by the Hoovers is the only
English translation available.

In the preface to his edition, the
translator says that his purpose was
“to give a. faithful, literaltranslation
of the author's statements; to give
these in a manner which will inter-
est the reader; and to observe. so far
as is possible, the style of the original
text.”

_ The department of mining at the
-University purchased its copy of the
translation shortly after publication
in 1912. At that time, little value was
a.ttac.hed.to the worth of the book, it
was obtained. for only ten dollars.

Editor’s Note: —This is the
seventh of a series of interviews
with prominent business men and
and industrial and economic
leaders in the Pittsburgh district
regarding economic affairs. The
eighth article will appear in the
next issue of the Pitt News.

By Jack Bunker

The sages tell us that it is “an ill
wind that blows nobody good,” even
the ill winds, perhaps, of a world-
wide depression that has got the
world by the heels and is giving it a
bulldog shaking.

As Mr. H. S. Wherret, president of
the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company,
sees it, this ill wind sprang from- a
zephyr as a. result of the whirlpool

‘economic conditions after the Vvorld

War when everything was in a. grand
flurry of speculation and over-produc-
tion. As we know, it did not become
a. cyclone until ’29. Vvhether he
thinks this “blow” will subside soon,
or not, Mr. \Vl1e.rrett declined to say,
and pointed to the many graveyards
a11d junk heaps of countless other
1’orecasts and prophesies. But he does
think this wind will do some
good. He says, “If this depression

gdoesn't give the ,;ount.r_v an effective
llesson, it will be too bad.

I am hope-
ful that it will, yet I suppose the
magic sound of money once again will
give us all a quick lapse of memor_v.”

Mr. W'herrett. thinks this slump will
bring, after it has passed or before.
important banking reforms, possibly
unemployment insurance, and very
likely better relations between indus-
try and the worker. _

lfneniployment insurance brought.
up the subject of tecllnocracy. About
the idea of the technocrats, Mr. ‘Wher-
rett had little to say, except this,
“'l‘ecl1nocrucy is exaggerated. Cer-
tain phases of it, however, are logical
and could well be incorporated into
our present system. There are. un-
doubtedly, many serious weaknesses
in our economic structure that need
correction. that will» have to have cor-~
rection soon: Our’ political "set-up, for’
example, need drastic reform to elim-
inate the tremendous waste that it is
causing the country."

From 'l‘ec_hnocracy Mr. Wherrett
had a last word to say; this about
Russia. Unlike 21 great many writers
on the subject, Mr. ‘Nherrett believes
Russia. is now fairly well established
and that the coming years will see,
great improvement there. Predicting
a. bright future for Russia, he said,
“I think Russia will become more cap-

italistic: all the time, but I also be-.

lieve they will eventually show the
world a fair example of a socialistic

All races of people since the beginning
of time, so far as we have been able
to read, have had some kind of a pipe
and have smoked something--whether
they called it tobacco or what not.

ND since smoking a pipe is so different
from smoking a cigar or cigarette,
we made a most painstaking, -scientiﬁc
study in an eﬁort to make, if we could,
a tobacco which was suited to pipes.
VVe found out, ﬁrst, that there was a
kind of tobacco that grew in the Blue
Grass section of Kentucky called White

of this tobacco whicli was between the
tobacco used for cigarettes and the to-
bacco uscd for chewing tobacco. It is
this tobacco which is

We found out that Mr. J. N. Wellman,
many years ago, made a pipe tobacco
which was Very popular. But it was
never advertised and after he passed
away nothing more was heard about it.
We acquired this Wcllman’ Method and

that is what we use in making Granger.

Next was the cut. ‘We knew that {fine
tobacco burnt hot because it burnt so
fast. You could hardly hold your pipe in
your hand, it got so hot at times.
remembering how folks used to “Whittle”
their tobacco we cut GRANGER just like
"whittle” tobacco —" Rough

“Craig’s Wife” Rehearsals
Continue Under Cass

 

 

The Pitt Players’ cast is greatly ad-
vanced in rehearsals of George Kelly's
prize-winning play, “Cra.ig’s Wit'e.,-" the
campus production of which is yet one
month away. Members have been
studying their parts since before the
holidays and have already had two
weeks of intensive practice under the
eye of Carl B. Cass. director.

“(‘.raig"s “life” was written by a
newly successful playwright who was
looked to for a play surpassing his
“Show Off.” a comedy hit of the pre-
vious year. “Craig’s Wife” was
Kelly's third long play for the legit-
imate stage, and his second triumph,

i 1925.

i »Kelly, formerly a civil engineer,
larchitect, vaudeville entertainer, and
writer of skits, was considered in
“Craig’s Wife” to have characterized
his stage people with great skill, The
substance of the play is a woman’s
selﬁshness, its effect upon her hus-
band and their friends, and its ﬁnal,
almost tragic result,

Mr, Cass chose his characters in
view of a top notch perforniance for
the play, and his choice is as follows:
Mrs. Craig, Dorothy Kaufman, Col.

Time of periods-20 minutes.

Trailing their opponents at the half-
way mark, three points, a ﬁghting
Panther team emerged at the game’s
end in the Pavilion Saturday evening
holding a 39-34 decision over the
‘Irish Ramblers in a game that kept
the 3,500 noisy fans on the edges of
their seats during the greater part of
the game.

During the first half the Ramblers;
looked as though they were to chalk:
up their third victory in cage compe-
tition against the Panthers. Through
the medium of scoring spurts, the
Irish were consistently able to draw
away when their scoring advantage
was threatened.

Only twice during that period were
the Panthers in possession of single-
point leads and they were soon wiped
out by a barrage of Irish ﬁeld shots.
Ten seconds after referee Lane had
blown the whistle begaii the 40-minute
whirlwind campaign, Cribbs, charged
with a foul against Krause, gave the
Irish the honor of the first score of
the evening; but Voegel’s foul against
Don Smith tied the score at one-all.
Don sank a ﬁeld goal to give the

Panthers a two-point lead. This ended .fo,feig_

the scoring by the Panthers for more
than six minutes, the Irish gaining a
seven-point advantage during that
time.

The Irish scoring machine slowed
up considerably after -.1 time out, to
give the Panthers another one-point
lead as the first half approached the
mid-time point. But again the Ramb-
lers turned on the power and edged
away from the Carlsonites to hold
their threerpoint advantage during the
last eight minutes of the ﬁrst half. :

A determined Panther came out on

the court for the game’s second half. night, the panther boxers opened their

Closing the three-point breach within
two minutes after the start of the
half, the Carlsonites held off the Irish
scoring thrusts during the rest of the
game.

Wit.li the score at 34-30, and the
Panthers in front, Crowe was evicted
from the game with four personal
fouls against him. Knowing now that
the odds were against them in ever
being able to take the Panthers into
camp, the Ramblers tried doggedly to
cut away that four point lead, Krause
with a foul and Jordan, scoring his
only ﬁeld goal of the game put the
Irish two points behind the Panthers.

Although Cribbs was banished from
the game on the same charge, his
eviction did not check the Panther's
hold on the scoring lead when Skippy
Hughes -sank’ his fourth doubledecker
just before the closing whistle to
give the Panther the victory.

Don Smith with thirteen points was
high scorer of the evening, closely
followed by Krause and Baldwin who
were credited with twelve counters
each.

ble is: the 'faculty;b0wlers _ha.ve _ I
decided (after a three-hour con- '
ference in Ted Biddle’s Oﬂice the
other afternoon when the inter-
frat league scores were studied
from all angles) that the boys
should not be allowed to clutter
up frat house mantels with addi-
tional cups if..they haven’t proved
themselves good enough.

Although the interfraternity
league does not close until tomor-
row night. the faculty have decided
to issue their perennial challenge 
before the match, It might aid
the morale, or scare the boys to
death, Anyway, it would be a
good story!

So Carl Distlehcrst, accounting
professor; Jules LeBarth, the Tro-
jan nemises from Mellon Insti-
tute; J. G. Quick, who gets them
coming and going up at the regis-
trar’s office; Ted Biddle who sep-
arates the Omega Delts from the
Delta Taus; and Walter -Rome,
the chief detector of trouble in all
activities; hereby challenge the
winners of the inter-fraternity
bowling league championship to a
ﬁnal championship match,'- at the
pleasure of the boys.

“It doesn’t make any differ-

In what appeared to be a.n effort to
continue the winning streak started
by the basketball team on Saturday)

1933 season by defeating the Temple
mittmen at Philadelphia Saturday, 4-3.

The ﬁnal score was a big upset to
local boxing circles, as the Owls hold
the Eastern Conference title and were
expected to dominate the teams of
this district.

Three technical knockouts featured
the bouts, two being scored by the
Panthers, and one by Temple. The
biggest upset of the evening was the
decision won by Jimmy Giannatti
over Bill Beloff in the lightweight
class. Beloff is the title-holder in
this class, but was decisively out-
pointed by Giannatti’s clever left
hand.

Jack Schricker registered the ﬁrst
kayo of the evening when Temple
threw -in the towel to save Marmar
from absorbing"too much punishment.
In the next ﬁght, Charley Gongloff,
ﬁghting his ﬁrst bout, sco"ed a one-
round knockout over Cossrow, of
Temple. Horowicz, ﬁghting for Pitt
in the 175-pound class, was the Victim
of a third round technical knockout.

Conti’s win, on a forfeit, was the
only other victory for the Panthers.

Two forfeits and one victory, with
an attendant loss, was the total re-

Neville alleys.

In the only game that showed two
teams present, the Omega Delt team
of Meyer, P,‘-Whitaker, Dague, Kaspar”
D. Vvhitaker, Siggins, and McAwley

of Lang. Cohen, Rosenﬁeld, Margolis.

for the three games played showed
the Omega Delts scoring 664, 578, and

EXPLANATION:

KEPT FRESH
!N THE WELDED
HUMIDOR PACK

This very old illusion was invented by Indian
fakirs. The secret was unearthed in 184-9 by the
great magician, Robert-Houdin. At that time, ether
had just been discovered, and little was known
about it. Houdin claimed that he had discovered
that this new anesthetic could make people light as

a hoop around the body to show there were no
wires or supports.

There are many, many explanations for this old
trick. One is thatthe girl wears a concealed harness,
which ends in a socket between her shoulder blades.
This is attached to a piston below the stage. The
piston is pushed up from below, causing her to
rise in the air. The piston is invisible, because it
is covered with mirrors which rcﬂect surrounding
draperies, similar to the background. The magi-
cian can pass the hoop over her body because it
is cut in one place. It can be'pulled'apart for a
second when it passes the piston.

Facing the Facts

1 N-LY a drastic slashing of committee expenditures can assure the

ﬁnancial success of the social melee into which Pitt students wil.l
be thrown next semester. This move alone can serve to avert further
‘dance failures, pending an investigation of t.he entire social program.

Faced by a social calendar that boasts six major dances in seven
consecutive weeks of school, even the most regular dance followers
will be seen to ﬂinch and turn away. Their doing so will be a matter
of necessity rather than choice. But t.l1is~will not alter the fact that
the chairmen of the events aﬁected will be left ‘,‘holding the bag”———
a situation they might avoid by facing the facts now.

For such class aﬁairs as the Junior Prom and the Freshman
Dance, reduction of expenditures is of two-fold importance. It
not only makes for the ﬁnancial success of the dance itself, but it
also provides an opportunity to strengthen class trcasuries.

Senior VVC-ck expenses constitute the “later burden” for the
sponsors of the forthcoming Junior Prom. That some preparation

- should be made now for meeting next year ’s class expenses is justi-

ﬁed by the records of past Senior VVeek expenses. The one event of
Senior Week which is expected to pay for itself and, if possible,
show a proﬁt, is the Senior Ball. But consider the ﬁgures for this
dance from the past two years!

In 1931 the Senior Ball lost $102.40——hardly what could be
called a ﬁnancial success. Last June, one year later, another class,
theoretically experienced in this business of promoting dances, more
than doubled the loss of their immediate predecessors. The 1932
Senior Ball lost $229.23! '

Even now some members of the present senior class are won-
dering where they are going to get the money for the 1933 Senior
\Veek. 'l‘his group of hopefuls can show an impressive bank bal-
ance now of $33.21-—with which they expectto meet Senior Week
expenses.

Members of the present junior cla,ss—and we assume 11ow that
they are aware of their ﬁnancial standing———have a bank balance of
$66.28, a small part of what it will take to carry out any kind of a
fourth year program.

Has the idea of having ﬁnancially unsuccessful Senior “leeks
become a Pitt tradition? If so, the time has come for a wholesale
houseclcaning of campus ideas and practices, and that with the ob-
ject in mind of making “regulation of social’ expenditures to meet
conditions”! a. tradition in itself.

Reduction of expenditures so as toplacc "these second semester
dances within the means of the average student, is the emergency
move which can save the series from failure. The junior class has
most to lose; therefore, we look to the Junior Prom committee for the
enterprise and courage, to abandon precedent for the needs of the
present. ‘

“Can’t Go To Class--Broke!”

Proposed Plan of Dr. McFadden Would Charge Students
at Each Lecture and “Stimulate Their Attention”

 

 

“Lend me sixty-ﬁve cents willya? I got a psych lecture next
period and only half a dollar left from_ my allowance!”

Cries such as this will be the common thing on the campus if
the plan advocated, by Dr. J. H. l\7IcFad_de1_1, assistant professor of
psychology, goes into effect. According to Dr. McFadden, the pay-
ment of the individual sum before each lecture would introduce 21

greater stimulus to the student to listen and observe. The lectures
would improve in that the instructorje
would outdo himself in talking before
a. capacity crowd at each session.

A greatfallacy of this plan is that
some professors would ﬁguratively do

All The News?

Since the Japanese drive in Man-
churia began, I have read the dis-
froni Tokio without ever
meeting an emphatic mention of a
political faction which is opposed to
Ja.pan’s present policy, And yet such
a party exists; and its strength is
growing. Quite as seldom is there
any mention of the methods used in
Are the soldiers
they conscripts?
The answer makes quite a difference
so far as any “war spirit” is con-
cerned, I have seen little mention of
the fact that the Japanese troops be-
ing poured into Manchuria. for the
coming spring campaign are all con-
scripts. In human terms, they are

' young men torn from their homes and

friends, and sent away to ﬁght :1 war
in which they have no interest.

It is gratifying to note that the im-
pending bankruptcy of the Tokio gov-
ernment has been brought to the at-

'tention of the Far East correspond-

cuts, To carry on her war Japan has
borrowed untix the limit of her credit
has been over—reached,' and she has
depreciated her currency until the
yen is worth less than one-half its
former value. Taxes are the highest
in her history. And if the present var
exp-enditures continue. taxes will soon
have to be doubled. ‘With deﬁcits, as
may be readily observed in the United
States, grow a popular demand for
change. And according to all reports
the Japanese are being cured of mili-
tary fever via the pocketbook. In the
meantime we can sit and wait.
Long Too Long.

Something in the ‘news of a less
serious character in the-‘ past few
weeks has been the ﬁlisbuster of Huey
Long, the last ﬁilii;-uster in American
history unless Senator Long stages
another very soon. Although it com-
promise on the branch banking pro-
visions of the Glass bill is being of-
fered Long to shut him up, the long
time effect of his ﬁlibuster will be
nil: for branch banking permitted,
and even fostered, by the Federal gov-
ernment is as inevitable as the annual
Thanksgiving proclamation, Long, in
his harangue, has been voicing the
last protest of the old-time rugged in-
dividualist in the banking business.
The present depression has been a
potent force in destroying the last
stronghold of the old locally-owned

HIS sort of thing has gone too
' far! When asked what product

“Little whales.”
Let’s take action at once. Get him
a good pipe and a tin of good tobacco.
We all know a pipe smooths out the
wrinkles, clears the mind for its best
thinking. And we all know what
smoking tobacco goes best in a good
pipe. For a recent investigation
showed Edgeworth to be the favorite
smoke at 42 out of 54 leading colleges.
Next time you “cram" for an exam,
light up a pipeful of Edgeworth. Ah!

terest on mortgages contracted during
the twenties, when the value of the
dollar was half what it is now, must
necessarily be clumsy. The debtor
class sees only inﬂation as a. way out.

Cool—headed individuals admit :1.
careful inflation would be practical,
even desirable. But a fear that once
begun, it will never stop accounts for
the noirendorsenient of it by econo-
mists and writers. ‘Walter Lippmann
always refers to the gold standard as
an eleventh eominandment which
Moses forgot to write down.

I believe that deepening depression
and the effects of painful indebted-
ness, among large corporations as
well as individuals, will bring about
an inﬂation policy very soon. The
best that we can hope for is a careful
undertaking by leaders who will know
when to call a halt.

Buy Next Door

Not being satisﬁed with the fanati-
cisni offered in the slogan Buy Ameri-
can, one Pittsburgh grocer has offered
his customers the suggestion that they
“Buy American, Buy Pennsylvania,
Buy 'Pittsburgh.” The area. within
which a. loyal citizen may purchase
the commodiities, he needs is apparent-
ly growing steadily smaller. It will
be no great shock if within the next,
few days such mottoes as “Buy Wil-
kinsburg" or “Buy-Beltzhoover” are
adopted.

events of the last year the country
over. Besides containing tables and

11u'esent evidence of business trends
since 1919,

Edited by Bervurd Nichols, this
number of the Review will be espe-
cially importunt for it will contain
data. on the most critical period in the
nation’s economic history. Although
it does not predict, because it feels
predictions are useless, the Review
p1‘esenf.s a forecast of probable future
business activity by means of its re-
views ol’ current and past conditions.

Enjoying as it does an international
reputation and respect among busi-

ERE’S a New Year resolution that’s a pleas-

ure to keep.

“RESOLVED :

I’m going to

telephone home each week!”

Think of the thrill it will give your Mother and Dad

——of the joy it will be to hear their voices each week!

It’s more than a substitute for cut-and-dried letters.

A telephone chat with home is next best to being

there.

Get the telephone habit. It’s surprisingly inexpen-
sive——cspecially after 8:30 P. M. That is when low

Night Rates go into

effect on Station to Station calls.

For 35 cents you can then call as far as 100 miles

away 1

To take advantage

of the night-time reduction, be

sure to make a Station to Station call. (Just give the

home telephone number and do not ask the operator

for any speciﬁc person.) If you like, of course,

charges can be reversed.
