Congress

Fills Posts

Men’s Council elected new mem-
bers and Student Congress put
some of its present members to
work at meetings of both legis-
lative bodies this week.

At Council’s regular meeting
Tuesday, two new members were
internally elected to fill vacant
positions.

The new men .are Dick Harper,
a, College junior, and Steve Stasko,
an Engineering and Mines junior.
The election of the two —men was
the first instituted under Council’s
new policyof allowing non-members
to petition for candidacy in an in-
ternal election.

Meanwhile at two meetings this
week Student Congress elected
the chairmen of several committees
and a new faculty advisor.

Ewart Gets Athletic Post

Don Ewart was chosen to repre-
sent the students on the Athletic
«Board, and Don Carothers will head
up the ‘publicity program of Con-
gress.

The new social chairman is
Dick Shallenberger, a newly elected
member who sparked this year's
program of mixer dances jointly
sponsored by Congress, Men’s
Council, and WSGA. Shallenberger
recently resigned from Council to
devote full time to his SC position.

Clint Lowery will chair the ap-
pointments committee, which takes
‘care of choosing dance chairmen,
spring festival workers, etc.

Bell wins Final Race
In the final election of the meet-
ing, Marg Bell was chosen Congress
representative to the WSGA com-
mission.
Heading the assembly committee
will be Dick Richards, Men’s
Council representative to Congress.

Awards for Event Winners

After the Cinderella pair is desig-
nated, the float parade winners, the
prize booths at Comix Capers and
Toyland and the winner of the
sweepstakes races will be awarded
trophies at intermission.

This event winds up Pitt9s annual
week of fun. According to students
who attended and the Spring Festi-
val committee, the celebration has
been a “howling success.”

Float Parade Winners

Festivities began Monday after-
noon with the colorful float parade
“Mother Goose ‘Goes to Town.”
“King Cole,” Phi Mu’s creation, and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s "Wynken,
Blynken and Nod” capped the best
decorated float honors.

The "Duck Gambol,” sweepstakes
race between fraternities, followed
the "float parade. Phi Gamma Delta's
entry swept the contest in record-
breaking time. \

-During the second day of acti-
vities, many students and faculty
members toured the sorority houses
getting refreshments and enjoying
games and dancing. These houses
were decorated in the "Childhood
Daze” theme and displayed nursery
rhyme characters.

Toyland Lighted Up

With flashing kleig lights the
carnival opened its three-day stand
Tuesday night. The various booths
and side-shows attracted a large
crowd. The huge spotlights search-
ing the skies added a novelty to
Pittsburgh's red steel mill glow.

The main-ball dance committee
states that sales for the Make-
Believe ball are limited to 1000.
They advise students interested

in attending the affair to pick up
tickets at the student desk or from
salesmen around the University to
be sure of getting ducats. Price is
$3.50.

The original boys and girls nom-
inated by organizations for the
“Make—Believe Sweethearts” con-
test, will all receive honors at the
main ball. ‘The girls receive roses

the dean of men’s office of his
father’s death. The son found Mr.

2:45 p.m. yesterday.
Theodore W. Biddle, dean of

most students were out of bed.

that time he was presented ag

Not First Time

Miss Friedman is not the first Owl
editor to be plagued with the missed-
deadline problem. Last year's Owl
was not distributed until midsummer
for identical reasons. The 1948 Owl
wasdistributed shortly after gradu-
ation.

i“The yearbooks will continue to
be late,” the harassed editor warned,
“unless the student body gives its
support from the beginning. Unless
2000 copies are sold in the fall, the
staff cannot publish a book the size
that a school like Pitt warrants and
which the students are accustomed
to receiving.”

iN0 Kick Coming

 No doubt a howl of protest will meet Owl Editor Renee Fried-
.man’s announcement that the yearbook will again be late this year.
,ﬂSeniors and undergraduates are by now accustomed to receiving
in their books in June, but they still don’t like it.

The fault, however, (as Miss Friedman points out) does not
fVlie with members of the Owl staff, but witli‘ the students who
it through procrastination and a lackadaisical attitude force the
Owl production deadlines to be extended at the beginning of the
 year. Slow sales -returns and delayed picture appointments have
necessitated such extensions every year, and every year suc-
 ceeding deadlines must be missed as a result of the initial slow

_ l.ast year every effort was made to make subscription purchas-
ing for the Owl as effortless as possible for the individual stu-
dent, but again the period had to be extended to enable last-minute

 As for the staff’s part in trying to get yearbooks out before
-jigraduation, a few little known facts can be revealed here.

3: The last two editors of the Owl, Lee Karageorge and Walter
 Thomp son, put in so much time on the yearbook that neither was
fable to graduate. Neither man has yet received his degree.

A Staff members consistently work far into the night while other
students are either enjoying themselves, studying, sleeping, or
picking up cash from part-time jobs. «Few members of the staff get
any of the above ‘inalienable rights’ of the normal student due to
 the time required by their duties. _

These factors, coupled with a staggering annual deficit caused
by sales inertia on the part of the student body every fall, nearly
forced the cancelling of the 1950 Owl by the University last year.

If the book fails to show a profit this year, it would not be
surprising if the administration decided to write off the Owl asaa

The ironic part of the story is that every June, and in the
months following, graduates besiege the Owl office with requests
for books they didn’t get around to ordering in the fall. There are
seldom any books available, since sound business procedure pro-
hibits the ordering of additional books on speculation.

It might be a good idea for students returning next year to clip
this editorial and attach a five-dollar bill to it for reference when
the Owl subscription campaign begins in September.

With Spring Festivalone ofthe biggest events on’the University
social calander, what do the students and faculty members have
to say about this colorful and much publicized week?

‘ Gloria sunderland, College 51;
‘A week is too long. It takes too
much out of study time.”

Dr. Richard McCoy, associate

Bill Green, College 52: "It
comes too close to finals, but it is
a good idea for the fraternities to
have their group projects.”

Valerie Jonas, College 52: “I
think there should be no tea dance
because no one has the time to at-
tend.” '

"Another objection is the $25
for the lot. Everybody is going in
the hole.”

Estelle Begler, College 52:
“There’s no conflict between
homework and festival. You just
put off studying for another week.”

Al Braun, College 53: “It’s
great, because you work like fools
and get nothing in return except
a lot of fun.”

Musical Reviewed

‘ By LARRY HERLICK

The factors in the construction of a good musical comedy are
not difficult to pick out. Take a few bright tunes, a story with a
happy ending, some pertinent dancing, and lots of good humor.

Mix them well and you have a show that will delight audiences
and gratify the people who present it.

The quality of the show is temp-
ered by the factors involved in its
production. The music should be
well played, the singing ensemble
should sing well, the players should
be cast properly, and the set and
costumes should be designed in a
light mood if the production is to
be successful.

Rodgers and Hart’s “A Connect-

’ icut Yankee” is a good musical
comedy. The songs are catchy, the
plot is easy to follow, and there,is
a reasonable‘ amount of fun.

Play is Last of Year

The Pitt Players are presenting
this show as their final offering of
the school year. They have injected
into it their own collective persona-
lity and ingenuity. The result
shows that the hard work which
they put into it was not wasted.

This whimsical storv cannot
helpbut appeal to the imagination.
The idea that a man of our own
time is transmitted into the literally
romantic days of the Round Table
attracts our fancy as all fantasies
do. And this particular production’s
shortcomings do not detract much
from the audience’s enjoyment of
it. “

All the members of the cast have
adequate voices for stage work.
It‘ is unfortunate that many of the
principal and secondary characters
are not properly cast.

Yankee Well Presented

The Yankee, as played by Orrin
Champer, is well presented. Cham-
per has a rich voice and seems to
be one of the few members of the
cast who feel the satirical nature
of the story. He enjoys his part
and conveys his enthusiasm to the
rest of the cast.

   

Other

hampered because, in addition to
playing difficult- parts, they mus_t
also struggle to overcome the dam-
pers put on them by miscasting.

Marjorie Cohen, as Morgan le
Fay, should be dark and seductive
But her blonde complexion and
hearty voice, which is impaired by
an unfortunate cold, give the im-
pression that she is a boisterous,
“drag ’em out” type. Her style in
the songs which shesings is fresh
and vigorous.

members of the cast are

Alisandra Too Demanding

Alisandra, played by Shirley
Long, should be sweet and inno-
cent, a big difference from the
promiscuous Morgan. Miss:Long’s
singing voice is different from Miss
Cohen’s , it is pretty and easy to
listen to, but, like Morgan, she is
demanding and grasping for her
man.

Other members of the large cast
also put forth a great effort to pre-
sent their characters successfully.
Ivan Sheetz, a very fine jester, is
erroneously a capricious Merlin.
Del Dematteo is a successful
cuckolding Sir Lancelot. And
Claire Zeligman and Mike Men-
delsohn sing a couple of bright
tunes nicely.

The orchestra and the singers
are under the baton of Robert
Arthur, the director of Pitt’s instru-

-mental music organizations. They

play and sing well together but are
at a slight disadvantage because
of the depth of the orchestra pit.
It is so low that the people on

stage can't hear the music and
must watch the conductor con-

stantly. as

 

The choreography is gracefully
executed by a chorus of well-train-
ed dancers. It is a credit to Mrs.
Rose Mukerji, who wro_te and direct-
ed the dancing, that she didn’t suc-
cumb to the temptation to put a lot
of boring “shmaltz” into the danc-
ing scenes. The dancing is attrac-
tive and easy to watch.

Except for a much too long audial
recapitulation of the play through
loud speakers near the end when
there is no action on the stage or
in the orchestra pit, the show is
fast and frivolous.

Bright costumes and an attractive
stage also help to make this last
Player production fairly a good
show.

Students Take
‘Free Library’
Idea Seriously

Apparently, some of the Pitt stu-

dents are taking the idea of a free
library too literally.
. Mrs. Dice, librarian of the sixth
floor Alldred room,,reports that at
least 50 books disappear from the
shelves every school year. “These
books are taken without being char-
ged out in our records,” Mrs. Dice
said.

In addition to these losses the
Alldred room loses about twenty
books every year through the read-
ers’ absent-mindness. "Many
books,” Mrs’. Dice said, “are char-
ged out all right, but when it comes
to returning them, the borrower
either forgets about it or misplaces
the book.

The more valuable editions in
the library must be kept in the lib-
rarian’s desk. “We have to take
these precautions,” Mrs. Dice ex-
plained, "because in the past,
many of our valuable autographed
editions and expensive volumes

EXAMINATION PERIOD

INSTR UCTOR R OOM

The finish line for seniors is
drawing near -- not only for class-
work, but also for the Commence-

~ment Ball, June 13 at the Webster

Hall Hotel.

May 26 is the deadline for se-
niors to pick up their reserved tic-
kets for the ball. Tickets are now
on sale at the Student Desk for
$2.75 plus tax.

The dance will carry ut the
commencement theme. Em ossed
leather souvenir programs will be
given to every couple attending.
The dance, the first of its kind
since before the war, will feature
Benny Benack and his campus or-
chestra. Benack has performed be-
fore several school dances, the
latest being the Comix Capers last
Monday. He is also directing the
chorus for “Connecticut Yankee,”
current Players’ production.

The Commencement Ball will be

climaxed by a finale waltz, led by
Mildred Egge, senior queen. Since
the dance follows the coronation
of the queen, the finale waltz will
honor both her and the graduating
seniors.
Informal dress will be the rule at
the dance in order to keep senior
expense to a minimum during the
graduation week.

Prep Star Picks Pitt
To Get Crack at Irish

By DON MURDOCK
Bill Reynolds, freshman football star, got away from West
Virginia. Now another schoolboy football standout from the mount-

aineer

state has decided to cast his lot

with Pitt.

He’s John Reger, a 5-11, 200-pound fullback from Linsly

ward Winne  
VarsityDay Program 

Honors 196 Athletes

Military School in Wheeling, W. Va.
It seems that Pittsburgh has more
to offer him than West Virginia.

"I have been at Pittsburgh for a
couple of days, and I like what I
see,” said the much-wanted ath-
lete while here Saturday.

Over 30 Offers

johnny received over 30 offers
from leading colleges in the Country,
including Notre Dame, Army, Ohio
State, Kentucky, Alabama, ‘Jaryland,
and West Virginia. But "I have
definitely decided to enroll at Pitt
in September,” he says.

"Pitt’s a good football school,
and I'd like to get a crack at Notre
Dame” is the reason Reger gives
for making up his mind.

He was chosen as an All-Wheeling
fullback in 1949 and was named
captain of the All-Ohio Valley
football squad the same -year.

. llas Friend llere

Although unknown to Pitt football
fans, Reger has one friend on the
Pitt football team. He is Reynolds,
who played against Reger While
attending St. Mary's High.

At Linsly the 18-year old athlete
played as a regular on the football,
basketball, and baseball squads.
Besides his fullback duties, he has
had experience at end. “I played
more at fullback at Linsly and that
is where I showed my best.”

He played guard for the Linsly
basketballers and. third base on

Second Fullback Collared

"I'll concentrate only on foot-
ball when I come to Pitt,” he adds.

If so,hewill be the second stand-
out high school fullback to come to
Pitt this year. In February highly-
rated Frank Nassida of Duquesne
Iligh School decided to become a
part of the Pitt family.

Reger is well acquainted with
both the T-formation and the single
wing, having played them under
Coach Edison Rine at the military
scho_ol.

Reger’s statement that he will
definitely come to Pitt will prob-
ably cause a lot of squawks from
West Virginia University, but fort-
unately for Pitt all the Mountaineers

can do is holler.

Pitt’s undefeated outdoor track

streak may be a thing of the past
tomorrow.

The thinclads will meet up with
their stiffest opposition of the
short season when they go against
West Virginia and Penn State at
State College in a triangular en-
gagement.

West Virginia will not provide
as much competition as Penn

State's veteran squad. Lion ]"im
Gehrdes of Olympic fame is al-
most invincible in the high and

ceptionally well in the 100-yard
dash.

Blue-and-Gold will have to de-
pend on valuable seconds and

Firsching vs. Lancaster

Another standout performer for
the Nittany Lions is Bill Lancaster
who won the 220-yard Invitational
at the Penn Relays last month.
Pitt has a good candidate to whip
the highly regarded Lancaster in
Dick Firsching.

If the Panthers can come back
with a victory, it will mark the
first undefeated campaign for the
Blue-and-Gold since 1937. Only
the IC;4As remain on the schedule.

Festival Tops
IM Softball

By BOB BEWERSDORF

Softball games are expendable
and cancellable. This fact was
proven last Tuesday when seve-
ral games were called off late in
the afternoon due to pressing
Spring Festival lactivities, ac-
cording to Intramural Director Leo
Bemis. . .

Some teams did manage, however,
to play their scheduled games.

In the top game of the day, the
YMCA nine remained unbeaten as
they whitewashed the Yanks, 16-0,
at the Ellsworth Center field.

Wiseman pitcher Tony DeLuca
hurled his second shutout of the
current Ilvl season, an almost un-
believable feat considering the
stringent pitching rules covering
the game.

Chems Win

The Chemical Engineers and the
Double E's had one big inning apiecd
Wednesday night, but the Chem boys
had the bigger frame and came off
with a 9-3 victory.

The Chem Engineers exploded
for nine runs in the third inning and
then displayed some ten-thumbed
fielding in the fourth to help the
Double E’s to three tallies. The
remainder of the game sparkled with
snappy infield play and occasion-
ally wild but brilliant pitching.

By DAVE WINTER

Even if term papers and studying
for »fast-approaching exams are
keeping you hopping, you’re still
a loafer compared to a lady regis-
tered in the evening school here.

Mrs. Margaret Evans and her
husband manage a 100-acre farm,
an 8-room house, a six-_year-old
daughter, and a herd of prize beef
cattle and both still find time to
drive 72 miles twice a week for
c lasses here at Pitt.

Mrs. Evans is a little shy and it
took quite a bit of coaxing to get
her to pose for a picture, even with
her husband.

But when she was asked if
juggling her waking hours to get
all her tasks done kept her busy,
her eyes lifted, and she flashed,
"You’re not kidding.”

No Help Other Than Pop

Does she have any help with the
work at the house and farm besides
her husband?

“No,” she said, "I do all my
own baking and we riever hire any-
‘one to do anything.We do everything
together.”

The Evans’ farm is six miles
outside of Pinebank, Pa., which
is about 16 miles from Waynesburg.
It‘ is about 100 acres, but they
grow only vegetables for‘their own
table. Their real business is a herd
of 14 registered Hereford beef
Cattle.

Mr. .Evans said, "People with
money raise prizecattle for a hobby,
but with us it's a money-making
proposition.” They haven’t shown
any of their cattle yet at county
or state fairs. But their cattle have
the same blood lines as prize-
winners at the biggest fair of them
all, the Chicago International, and
the Evans have dreams.

She'll Get Waynesburgi” Degree

Mrs. Evans used to be an ele-
mentary. school teacher in the de-
pression years, and she is taking
four hours "a week here for her
bachelor’s degree. Her only reason
for attending school here is that
Waynesburg College, where she
intends to get her sheepskin, has
no evening classes.
