By Lisa Broujos
For The Pitt News

A liquid that makes wounds
heal faster is being tested on pa-
tients at the Wound Healing/
Limb Preservation Clinic of the

3 University of Pittsburgh.

”People are just starting to un-
derstand how wounds are heal-
ing,” said Theodora Mauro,
Ph.D. of dermatology at the clin-
ic. Dr. David Knighton from Min-
nesota was instrumental in
starting the Curatech Company,
which first conducted the tests us-

ing the wound-healing medicine. ,
e . Mauro explained that theliquid

medicine contains factors found
in platelets which make cells
grow faster. ’’It is important to
find something that‘stimu_lates the
fibroblasts in cells,’' said Mauro,
since the fast growth of the

fibroblasts speeds up the healing

tion ”gets the whole ball rolling

as far as healing is concerned.”
The clinic has arranged the

Citiparks sponsors impaired runners

‘By Mike VanAuker

A For The Pitt News

Citiparks is sponsoring a run-

ning club for the mentally retard-
ed and physically handicapped.
Representing Pitt in this effort are
several university students and
employees.
‘ This club is the local Achilles
Chapter, which is part of an in-
ternational organization spon-
sored by the New York
Roadrunners.

Approximately 1O to 15 people
with various special conditions
regularly participate, and there
are a similar number of volun-
teers. Several participants are in
wheelchairs, and at least one has
suffered a stroke.

Mike Cornellius of Citiparks
heads the local group, which
meets Tuesday and Thursday
evenings at Schenley Park.

Volunteer Cyndee Jones, who
works in the health care division
here at Pitt, explained that on
Tuesdays they work on speed
and on Thursdays, distance. Jones
has been a volunteer with the

club for three weeks.
1 he program runs trom June to

September. Although Cornellius

sees the club as an opportunity
for social running, the par-
ticipants do also train for races,

during which each participant is P

escorted by a volunteer. The club
helps fulfill what Cornellius
describes as the ”mainstreaming
concept,” integrating these peo-
ple into society. ”They train in

public and they race in public,”

he said.

Cornellius said that there is a
little effort. involved in running
the program, recruiting volun-
teers and organizing it, but it is
worthwhile because it fills the
needs of ”those who want to help
and those who want to be
helped.”

He also gains pleasure from
other people's satisfaction. ”The
most important thing is seeing
people accomplish goals,” he
said.

Jones echoes this idea. ”lt's
nice to be able to share running
knowledge and to be right there
to coax them,” she said. Sharing
her enjoyment of runnin_g was
her main reason for volunteering.

Although she enjoys compet-
ing,‘ and many participants also
have that spirit, for others, simple
completion of the race is fulfill-
ment enough. ”Everyone has [his]

own goals,” she said.

Sometimes there are more
volunteers than participants, but
the club always tries to have at
least one volunteer for every par-
ticipant for one—on—one interac-
tion. Often, volunteers and
participants are matched on
ability.

Other Pitt volunteers include
Ph.D. student Janet Mayernik, ad-
missions counselor Michael Ber-
tonaschi and math instructor Bill
Troy. New volunteers are always
welcome and should contact the
Citiparks Therapeutic Program
Office.

The last race of the season’ is
the 3.1 mile South Side Race at
South Side Hospital on Sept. 25.
Cornellius said that other races
have been fun and successful. "It
was good to see that everyone
trained well enough,” he said.
‘ Citiparks runs these special
programs for the handicapped
and retarded‘ in almost all major
competitive sports. Before joining
the running club, Jones was in-
volved with the basketball pro-
gram. The Pitt soccer team will be
holding a clinic/exhibition for the

Special Olympics Soccer Pro-

gram on Oct. 3.

Conference to focus on

future black leadership ,

By, Michelle L. O'Brien

For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
will host a conference spon-
sored by the Office of the

_ Provost in conjunction with

the Pittsburgh chapter of the
NAACP and the Pittsburgh Ur-
ban League to address the spe-
cial challenges faced by
current and future black
leaders. ‘

According to Birney Harri-
gan, assistant to the provost,
the conference is scheduled
for Feb. 24-25, 1989, and will
include workshops, speakers
and presentations of papers
written by undergraduates
from around the country on
the topic ”Black Leadership in
the 21st Century.”

Harrigan said the objective
of the conference is ”to get
students to think about their
future ‘roles as leaders of the

. black community.” No work-

shop topics or speakers have
been confirmed yet, according
to Harrigan.

”This is a topic of interest to
everyone, not just black stu-

dents,” Harrigan said. She is
encouraging Pitt students to
submit papers for considera-
tion. Harrigan said students‘
can approach the topic in any
way they choose, as long as it
includes some form of ”scho—
larly research.” ~ ‘

This is a topic of in-

tereset to everyone 

— Birney Harrigan

All papers submitted will be
judged by university faculty
members and the editorial
board of the Pittsburgh Under-
graduate Review, a research
journal published quarterly by
the University Honors Col-
lege. Papers chosen for
presentation at the conference
will be published in a special
edition of the Review.

Harrigan said the Honors
College will also present a
$500 prize for the best paper.

Proposed child abuse law broadens culpability‘

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ Witness-
es at a public hearing Tuesday
dissected a proposed law that
would expand the definition of
child and sexual abuse and re-
quire further documentation of
the crime.

Under the proposed bill, which
amends the state Child Protective
Services Law, the definition of
child abuse would include
repeated minor injuries.

The bill also would include the
word exploitation in the defini-
tion of sexual abuse and delete
the requirement that the abuse be
inflicted for commercial
purposes.

The bill calls for law enforce-
ment authorities to respond to
child abuse and would expand
the class of possible child abusers
to include all care givers, from
day-care providers to school
teachers.

No indictment in
1985 MOVE case

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
Justice Department announced
Tuesday there is insufficient evi-
dence to seek indictments in the
investigation of action taken by
Philadelphia city officials and
police in the 1985 MOVE con-
frontation, which left 11 people
dead and nearly two square
blocks in flames.

The investigation examined
whether the officials or police
violated the civil rights of those
who died in the bombing and en-
suing fire, said Assistant Attorney
General William Bradford
Reynolds.

”We  just found insufficient
evidence to go forward with an
indictment of anybody,” Rey-
nolds, head of the department's
civil rights division, said in an in-

‘ terview.

It was the second time a crimi-
nal probe of Philadelphia Mayor
W. Wilson Goode and others in
the MOVE incident has been

concluded without indictments.
A local grand jury in Philadelphia
earlier this year strongly criticized
city officials for their handling of
the confrontation.

Aluminum unions
very upset at Alcoa

PITTSBURGH (AP) T‘ One of
the major unions at Aluminum
Co. of America told its members
to withdraw from labor-
management quality teams in
reaction to the breakdown of ear-
ly contract negotiations.

”Our local unions are very
much upset with Alcoa,” said
John Murphy, chief negotiator for
the Aluminum, Brick & Glass
Workers.

The nation's largest aluminum
producer and the ABGW agreed
two years ago to cooperate in
programs designed to increase ef-
ficiency, product quality and em-

ployee satisfaction.

The union represents about
8,000 employees at nine Alcoa
plants, the largest being Evans-
ville, Ind., and Davenport, Iowa.

Slain navy diver
recalled as brave

/.

FRANKFURT, West Germany
(AP) —— A U.S. Navy diver ”never
made a sound” as he bravely en-
dured savage beatings by the
hijackers of a TWA jetliner, flight
attendant Uli Derickson testified
Tuesday.

Derickson said Mohammed Ali
Hamadi, on trial for air piracy and
the murder of Navy diver Robert
Stethem, also threatened to blow
up the airplane.

The German—born woman,
now a naturalized U.S. citizen
and the subject of a U.S. televi-
sion movie earlier this year, said
Hamadi held a gun to her head
shortly after the Athens to Rome

suffering endured by Stethem.

The hijackers ”took him up to
the cockpit and started to brutal-
ly beat him. They beat on him as
long as he stood,” Derickson told
the court.

”When Mr. Stethem collapsed/O

Russian black market provides profitable tourist adventure

When packing to go to the
Soviet Union, start with candy
bars, cigarettes, bubble gum,
backpacks, college T-shirts,
Swatches, Walkmans, rock ’n’
roll tapes and, of course, blue
jeans. ’

...Then, if‘ you have room in
your luggage, pack your clothes.

The black market is alive and
well in Russia, and if you have
any of the above, you could be
rich —— while you are there.

  Paid ForB

You can trade for rubles or
gifts. Usually, that depends on the
person you trade with. Some
traders are citizens who use the
black market as a way to supple-
ment their income. Others find it
exciting to receive ”gifts" from
foreigners and usually keep the
item or else give it to a relative.

We were warned about the
professional black marketeers.
These people trade merchandise
for merchandise or money as a
business. They usually have _the

MICHELE
QUINN

influence and money to make
sure they don't get caught and to
make themselves more accessible
to tourists.

For instance, a professional
trader with the right connections
can rent a room in a tourist hotel
— one which only allows tourists

as guests, and not Soviet citizens.
This provides the tourist with the
comfort of trading indoors instead
of at bus stops at night, or in an
alley.

Previous travelers advised us to
stay away from the ones who ap-
proached us in popular tourist
sites such as Red Square. They
usually knew how to expertly
:heat tourists out of their belong-
ings. .

tour did not listen to the advice
and traded with professionals.
One young man was so excited
that he traded his docksider shoes

for a T—shirt which said Moscow .

University, only to discover later
that the shirt tag read ”Made in
the U.S.A.”

Another student, who talked
with the same trader, was told
that he needed to check on the
catalog number in hisfiles before
he could tell her how much she
would receive for her Walkman.
She was also told that he would
trade for Nike only, not Adidas.

Others decided not to bother
trading merchandise and instead
changed money with traders. A
tourist could receive from four to

’ six times the amount trading with
' a marketeer compared to chang-

ing currency at a government
office.

We had previously been
warned that this was the most
dangerous way to trade in Russia,
since some of the money-
changers were rumoured to be
secret police.

I decided to trade with a young
woman who worked behind the
counter of the hotel. She ap-
proached me timidly one evening
as I was waiting for the elevator.
We set up a time to meet in my
room, and she encouraged me to
invite my friends and to ”bring
jeans/’

I was nervous, wondering if it
was a trap and the secret police
would break down the door at
any moment. However, at 11
p.m., she showed up quietly tap-
ping at my door.

The woman stood silently as

my friend, Laura, and I placed all

of our items on the bed. Laura
decided to trade jeans and a T-
shirt for rubles, while I traded
bubble gum, a cheap solar calcu-
lator, cigarettes and my backpack
for money and merchandise.

The going rate that evening was
approximately $8 for a pack of
Marlboro Lights, $30 for a pair of
old, faded jeans and, $2 for
Wrigley’s spearmint gum. I
received a black fur hat and $40
for the solar calculator and the
backpack (which I had bought in
the States for $15).

As the woman left, she hand-
ed me a small, wooden doll
which opened up to contain
another doll. She said, speaking
with a very heavy accent and fre-
quently stopping to find the right
words, that it was a gift from her
to me for bringing my friend and
her pair of jeans.

. I never found out the blonde
woman's name and never saw

her again during our stay at that
hotel.

In a way, I was glad. I had been
caught up in the ”black market
fever” as many of my friends had
been. Even though she was prob-
ably linked with a professional
trader, I still felt guilty that I had
made a profit because some
Soviet somewhere wanted to see
what it was like to chew a piece,
of bubble gum.

This is the third in a series of
stories by Michele Quinn, who
spent last year traveling in Europe
and the Soviet Union.

By Colleen Denne
For The Pitt News

This year, 14 percent more
Greek rushees pledged with a
Pitt sorority and approximate-
ly 5 percent more with a frater-
nity than last year, according
to Bridget Guernsey, assistant

"‘ director of student activities

and Greek advisor.

’’I think people are wanting
to become more involved with
the Greek system more so than
just one group,” said
L__Guernsey.

Each fall and winter term,
both the Panhellenic Associa-
tion and the lnterfraternity
Council sponser a rush period
in which students are ac-
quainted with various Greek
organizations. Each fraternity
and sorority, however, has its
own individual manner for
bringing in new members.

This year, 322 young wom-
en registered for Panhellenic
formal rush, which lasted Sept.
4-9.

The Panhellenic rush divid-
ed all rushees into 12 groups,

if-‘Pledge numbers up for rush

each group having two coun-
selors. The counselors are
responsible for maintaining in-
terest in the sorority and
monitoring each rushee.

Jennifer Hublitz, internal
vice president of the Pan-
hellenic Association, said that
this year's counselors did an
especially good job in keeping
interest.

\

This year, 142 girls pledged,
while last year, 105 of 325
rushees pledged a sorority.

”doubIe—b|inded fashion,” ac-
cording to Mauro. This type of
test divides the experimental pa-
tients into two groups: one group
has the liquid medicine applied
to the wound, and the other has
just a plain liquid applied.

Neither the doctors nor the pa-
tients know which liquid they
have until the end of the 12-week
period, when the separate groups
are revealed.

”This is the best way of show-
ing that a medicine works,”
Mauro said. The study, which is
half finished, requires that pa-

 

    

tients be examined every week.
Fou-r biopsies are taken during
this 12-week period.

The medicine is mainly for
people such as diabetics or the
elderly, who have trouble healing
wounds, and the test is conduct-
ed among patients who have
chronic ulcers. Mauro, pointing
out the danger of s|ow—healing
wounds on the feet, said that in-
fections can work their way into
the bone, resulting in possible

Arethe Olympics fair?

Every four years, the best athletes from around the world represent
their respective countries in the the ultimate showing of dedication,
athleticism and courage — namely, the Olympics.

I But, as is bound to happen in an assembly of most of the countries
from around the world, egos, politics and ’’rankings,” if you will,
can sometimes get in the w-ay of the true spirit of a given event.

The United States delegation seems to have been getting the short .

end of the stick in the XXIV Olympiad. No fewer than four alterca-

tions have taken place.

First came thelopening ceremonies, in which some members of
the United Statesdelegation wore Mickey Mouse ears and toted ”Hi,
Mom," signs. The International.Olympics Committee called them a
”disgrace” and re rimanded those involved. .

Next came the case of Anthony Hembrick, a U.S. boxer who ar-
rived four minutes late for his bout and was consequently disquali-
fied. His opponent was awarded a walkover victory, and the case

is under appeal.

Hembrick said that an incorrect fight schedule and transportation
problems kept him from arriving on time.

Thirdly came a loss of five-tenths of point from_the US, Women's
Cymﬁasties teams seoré, Which pushed them out of third place and

behind the East Germans. .

Coincidentally, itwas an East German official who noted that a
member of the U.S. team was on the performing podium while a
teammate was in the midst of her routine.

Lastly came the case ofJuan Moreno, a U.S. finalist in ‘the tae kwon-
do competition. Moreno plead that he had, in fact, earned the gold
medal in a bout with Korean team member Jimmy Kim, but that bi-
ased judging of a Korean-born sport cost him top honors in the exhi-

bition match.

Of course, the eventual outcome of this fight was at the mercy of
the judges, whose decision is final. No argument there.

All of the remaining grievances filed against the United States are
legitimate. Certain rules and codes of behavior must be followed if
the Olympics are to run smoothly.

But if the Olympics are to be a true show of the best 1’amateur”
sports have to offer, then politics and the feelings harboured by cer-
tain nations toward others should be left at home. Let the athletes

com pete.

The age of conservativism ends with

No matter who wins the.
presidential election in Novem-
ber, when Ronald Reagan leaves
the Oval Office, coat and caval-
ry hat in hand, the legacy of the
last reigning conservative move-
ment for some time will go with
him. .

Oddly enough, the tenure of
President Reagan, archangel of
conservatism, never gave carte
blanche to the radical right. In-
deed, many of the conservative
items on the social agenda (abor-
tion, Affirmative Action, gay
rights) were barely touched. Still,
Reagan's economic (largest tax

"cut in U.S. history) and foreign

(invasion of Grenada) policies
were so to the right of his last few
predecessors that voters won-
dered if the man had a left arm.

After winning yet another
landslide election in 1984, Rea-
gan and the Republican party
seemed undaunted. For some-
time afterwards, Reagan roamed
the world like Caesar, curbing the
Soviets in Afghanistan with the
”Reagan Doctrine” and hum-

bling Qaddafi in the Gulf of Sidra.
However, the last two ‘years have
taken the wind out of the presi-
dent's sail with the one-two near
knock-out punch of the Iran-
Contra scandal and a lame-duck
presidency.

Now, for the first time in 20
years, the American electorate
faces a_ clean—s|ate presidential
race, a race in which there is no
incumbent. Also, after having had
a conservative leader steer the
country for the last eight years,
the nation is without a conserva-
tive heir apparent.

The first omen predicting dis-
satisfaction with the right was the
drowsy reception received by the
more conservative candidates
during the Republican primaries.
Former Secretary of State Al Haig
and former Delaware Gov. Pete
Du Pont were the earliest casual-
ties. Congressman Jackl Kemp,
probably the most knowledgea-
ble conservative candidate in
years, never got his campaign off
the ground. Even the Rev. Pat
Robertson, who surprised every-

Counting counts against Malek

Last week, Fred Malek, a form-
er Nixon aide, was forced to re-
sign as of one of George Bush's
chief campaign managers be-
cause it was discovered that he
had beencounting Jews in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
figures were needed by President
Nixon because he suspected that
Jewish personnel were hurting his
economic programs. After the
count, punitive action was taken
against two BLS employees.

When the story broke, Malek
pleaded innocent and maintained
that he haddone nothing wrong.
How it all -startedvis anybody’s
guess. We do know that H.R.
Haldeman was the one who
passed on President Nixon's
orders.

”Fred, the President wants you
to add up all theJews in the BLS.”

”Any particular reason, H.R.?”

”The boss is under the impres-
sion that there is a Jewish cabal
in the department, and he wants
to break it up.”

”Does he want me to count
Hispanics, blacks, Lithuanians
and Jehovah’s Witnesses as
well?’’ '

”He didn't mention them. So.

just stay with the Jews for the
moment.”
“I don't like it, H.R.”

one with a strong second in Iowa
(thanks to cross-over voters),
failed to carry his momentum
into March's ”Super Tuesday”
and beyond. '

The absence of the conservative
gang-of-four led to a confronta-
tion between the like-it-or-not
moderates Bob Dole and George
Bush to lead the race between

Republican presidential
nominees, a race Bush managed
to endure.

At first, all was not lost for the
conservative movement. There
was still the vice president to be
selected. Perhaps if Bush reached
into the supermarket supply of
conservative politicians, the rul-
ing right would have a believable
claim to fame. All Bush had to do
was dip his hand into the well
and either pull out a Jack Kemp
(R-N.Y.) or a Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.).

”What don't you like about it,

~ Fred?”

”Someday I am going to head
up the ‘George Bush for Presi-
dent’ campaign. How is it going
to look on my resume if they find
out that I was counting Jews for
Nixon?” ,

”No one will ever find out.
Look, I know this is not one of the
greatest ideas the boss has ever
come up with; we have to obey
orders.”

ART
BUCHWALD  

”Why don't you do it, H.R.?”

”I’d love to, but I'm too busy
counting student Quakers at
Berkley. I don’t understand why
this is such a big deal for you."

”Some people get angry when
you dig up ethnic background or
the religous preference of govern-
ment employees.” .

”We know all about them, and
we're getting their names. Fred,
the BLS is not a big department.
You could go through their per-
sonnel list in one afternoon.”

”You know, H.R., I am not
anti—Semitic.”

”Of course, you're not. That's
why we are giving you the job.

Instead, Bush anointed J. Dan-
torth Quayle (R—Ind.), leaving
conservatives, liberals and
moderates aghast.

True, Quayle does have a con-
servative voting record, but his
qualifications as someone to
respect on a ticket are not over-
whelming. Quayle is young,
energetic and attractive, a Prince
Charming in golfing togs. Yes,
Dan Quayle is all these things,
but then, so is Rob Lowe. An al-
leged tryst with an up—and-
coming Playboy bunny, possible
pulled strings to enter law school
and the now—infamous stint in the
National Guard are eclipsing his
voting record and enthusiasm. It
seems Bush and Jim Baker were
more interested in pandering to
their baby-boomer constituent
rather than selecting a more
responsible, albeit less engaging,
veep.

There are those who would de-
fend until their death that George
Bush is indeed the golden boy of
conservatism, that his claim to

Do you think that the boss would
ask somebody who didn't like
Jews to do this?”

$ ”What am I supposed to say if

it leaks out?”

”You say you were just follow— \

ing orders. A man who works in
the White House does not ques-
tion a directive from the President
of the United States of America.”

”Why can’t John Ehrlichman?
He's known for carrying out slea-
zy operations.”

”The boss wants_you to do it.
He considers you the best ethnic
head counter in the business."

”How will I know that if I
count Jews, Nixon won't then ask
me to add up Italians, French,
Japanese—Americans and Knights
of Malta?”

’’I don't see that happening in

the near future. Look, Fred, you

know that every once in a while
the boss gets all exercised about
something going wrong in the
government. As far as the BLS is
concerned, he honestly believes
that they gave him the sword.”

”OK, give me the printout of
the BLS  one Jew, two Jews,

favor more spending on educa-

tion, the environment and a v

child-care program is a ruse
designed to make him more
palatable to moderates, indepen-
dents and women.

Perhaps, but I don't think Bush
is so ignorant as to think that the
electorate, and especially the
liberal media, would forget such
unusual campaign flirtations from
a Republican nominee. George
Bush is no moderate. I think he
thinks he's sincere on his ”no tax
hike” pledge and his affections
for the Contras, SDI and other
right-wing playthings, but he cer-
tainly won't defend them with the
fervor of a Reagan or Goldwater.

It seems to come down to this:
No matter which candidate wins
the election, the true right-wing
of the Republican party will be
left unsatisfied.

While the boss is away,
Hoover takes control

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Excuse Sue Hoover if she is
more than a little excited tonight
when the Pitt women's volleyball
team plays a match against
Robert Morris at the Colonial’s
home court.

Hoover,a former Pitt volleyball
standout, will assume the head
coaching duties of the women's
volleyball team on an interim ba-
sis while head coach Shelton Col-
lier is in Seoul with the U.S.
women's ‘team.

Despite leaving a young, rela-
tively inexperienced team be-
hind, Collier feels comfortable
that his assistant is the right per-
son for the job.

’’I am confident about two
things as far as Sue taking over.
First, I'm sure she will do a really
good job, and secondly, I am
confident in my players’ ability to
handle the situation well,” he
noted.

Collier believes that Hoover
knows his coaching system as
well as anyone, a fact that the
team readily concurs with.

”Sue has played for Shelton
since high school [when Hoover
played Collier’s Junior Olympic
team]. I'm sure her practices will
fit her individual taste, but she
knows the [Collier] system. I think
she will do fine,” said All-
American candidate Denise
Frawley.

For Hoover, the opportunity to

take over the Pitt program in Col-
lier’s absence is exciting.

’’If I am going to become a
head coach in the future, it is a
great opportunity for me to learn
in a matter of weeks,” she said.

Hoover first became interested
in coaching at the conclusion of

her sophomore season at Pitt.

'Co|lier approached her about
working some volleyball camps
with him during the summer. She
accepted the offer and discovered
that she enjoyed working with
junior high and high school
players.

”She|ton asked me at the end
of summer if I would consider be-
ing his assistant after graduation,”
recalled Hoover.

Hoover did not accept the offer
immediately; however, the more
she thought about it, the better it
sounded.

”My sister is a coach, and I
wanted to stay in volleyball. The

. idea became more appealing, all

the time,” said Hoover. The end
result was Hoover's becoming
Pitt’_s assistant women's volley-
ball coach prior to the start of the
1987 season. I

Hoover feels fortunate to be
working with this particular
group of athletes. ‘

”I have a lot of confidence in
the girls, and I know we are go-
ing to do well,” Hoover said.
”The girls are going to get better
because they are pulling together
to help me out.”

Hoover's confidence in her
team is reciprocated by the
team’s confidence in her.

As junior setter Lori Silk noted,
’’I feel really confident that Sue
is going to do a good job. She is
being really positive with us.”

Collier fully expects the Lady
Panthers to improve in his ab-
sence. Hoover and the team ex-

pect a quantum leap in
performance as the team gets
more experience playing
together.

Senior middle blocker Nora
Mulvihill feels the team is start-
ing to jell.

Feltingoff looking forward to new season

By Ed Kuznikf I

Staff Writer

Six years ago, Tracy Feltingoff
was not exactly a top candidate
to be playing the No. I women's
singles position at a Division I
university.

Feltingoff occupied the lowest
position on her team at Emaus
High School in Allentown as a
sophomore (the first year she
played organized tennis). But
since then, she has dedicated her-
self to the sport, and in the last
two years she has improved to
the point of attaining the top spot
under Coach George Dieffen-
bach at the University of

/\/Ien’s tennis team places

By Mike Seperack

For The Pitt News

The men's tennis team took the
first step on its road to improve-
ment last weekend with a sixth-
place finish at the Big East Tour-
nament in Weekapang, R.I.

This was a step up from last
year's seventh-place finish.

”We played well," said Coach
Dieffenbach. ”The league was a
lot stronger than last year.”

Pittsburgh.

’’I started playing six hours a
day after that [her sophomore sea-
son],” Feltingoff said [after posting
her first victory of the season —
a 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 win over Carnegie
Me|lon’s Suzy Dottor. ”Six years
isn't a lot oftime to be playing or-
ganized tennis, but I've loved the
sport all my life and played it
when I was younger. I guess, in
a way, it's good that I haven't
been playing that long, because
I'm not sick of it yet.”

Feltingoff obviously improved
at a rapid rate in high school, and
by the time her senior season
rolled around, she was a legiti-
mate tennis prospect. She chose

In singles, second-seeded
sophomore Paul Maben ad-
vanced to the semi-finals before
falling to Lynn Moore of Geor-
getown, 6-3, 6-4.

Juniors John Tegana and Vivek
Kumar each won a consolation
match for the Panthers. Tegana

lanan, 6-1,6-I, while Kumar beat

Pitt for both the academic and
athletic programs, and from
there, her career has risen
steadily.

Feltingoff immediately moved
into the No.2 singles position
during her freshman year in col-
lege, and then she climbed all the
way to the top of the Lady Pan-
ther ladder last year.

In retrospect, she feels she's im-
proved greatly from that first sea-
son. ”Mentally, going out there
as a freshman it was totally differ-
ent,” Feltingoff said. ’’I didn’t
know what to expect. Now, I'm
a lot more prepared for my
matches.”

The junior has developed a

also won a consolation game for
Pitt.

In doubles, the team of sopho-
more Jeff Mills and freshman Lar-
ry Girard advanced to the final
round. They had to get by Calla-
nan and Samarco of Seton Hall,
and Rouse and Forest of Vil-
Ianova.

The final match went to three
sets, with Mills and Girard even-
tually losing, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.

Maben and Kumar won a dou-

steady baseline game as the years
have passed, and the serve and
approach shots are the key to her
success. Occassionally she will
come to the net in a volley at-
tempt, but for the most part, she
is content to sit back and slug it
out with her opponent.

Feltingoff, in fact, would like
nothing better than to give some
of her Big East counterparts a
good lesson in Ivan Lendl-like
tennis.

Like almost everyone associat-
ed with the Pitt program, she is
tired of staring up at the rest of her
conference opponents - the Lady
Panthers finished with a 10-6
record last season but were the

' th t
bles consolation match against
Bellzberg and Valiuis of Geor-
getown, 6—O, 6-2.

As expected, Boston College
finished first in the tournament.
The Eagles were followed by
Providence, St. John's, George-
town and Villanova. Pitt finished
sixth, with Connecticut and Seton
Hall rounding out the field.

”We did much better than last
year,” said Dieffenbach. ”Hope—
fully, we'll improve next year.”

doormats of the Big East in the an-
nual league tournament.

”Getting out of the bottom of
the Big East isimy biggest goal,”
Feltingoff said. ’’I also want to im-
prove on my academics. Plus, I
want to have a good time. We
have a lot of fun on this team.”

She also relished being in a po-
sition to play the opposing team's
top gun in every match. ”It’s a
great feeling. You have to play
your best all the time. You can't
mess up at all.”

That should not be much of a
problem for Feltingoff, because
for the last six years, she has done
anything but mess up. '

B ° E t

Dieffenbach added that the
team can't wait to face George-
town and Villanova in the spring.

”We were pretty even with Vil-
lanova,” he said.

Maben defeated Taylor Teres-
si, Vi|lanova’s No. 2 seed, in the
first round of singles play. The
doubles team of Mills and Girard
beat Villanova’s No. I doubles
team in the semi-finals.

”It should make for an interest-
ing spring," said Dieffenbach.

 

 

CHICAGO (AP) ~ Michael
Jordan signed a new contract
with the Chicago Bulls on
Tuesday that will keep him
with the club for at least the
next eight years.

The new deal involves a res-

general manager.

Jordan won every major
award last season, including

He also captured the NBA

year in a row, averaging 35

Jordan is entering his fifth

Chicago's first-round pick in
the 1984 National Basketball

The Bulls made no reference

Collier to stay at Pitt,
turns down pro team

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Just before Pitt women's
volleyball coach Shelton Col-
lier departed for Seoul and the
games of the XXIV Olympiad,
he was contacted by two
teams from the Women's
Professional Volleyball League
about his future availability.

The league starts its third
season in January, and both
the San Jose Golddiggers and
the Portland Spikers were anx-
ious to secure Collier’s coach-
ing talents.

The Portland and San Jose
franchises admired the indeli-
ble mark that Collier left in his
only season of coaching
professional volleyball (named
Coach of the Year at San lose
in 1987). Additionally, they
were impressed by his U.S.
National Team experience, as
well as by the growing nation-
al reputation of the Pitt

program.
Collier turned down the

oﬂen

”Dr. Bozik and Carol
Sprague [Pitt women's athlet-
ic director] have been ex-
tremely supportive of my
involvement with the U.S. Na-
tional Program and with al-
lowing me to coach one year
previously in the professional
league. It is simply better that
I not consider any further dis-
tractions from my team,” he
said.

Collier felt a sense of com-
mitment to the older players
on the team with whom he has
been through so much. He
also noted that he had a lot of
young players on the team he
enjoys working with.

”Even in going to the Olym-
pics, my number one goal is
to have the most successful
Pitt volleyball team possible.
That is where my heart and
energy are now and will be
when I return,” stated the
coach.

U. 5. Olympic team gets on track

after Soviets take early medals

By john Nelson
AP Sports Writer

SEOUL, South Korea — A
wounded hero, a worried warri-
or and a squad of long—range
bombers: That's what it took to
get the United States going at the
Seoul Olympics, where the
Soviets were running away with
medals.

Greg Louganis, five stitches still
in his head from a rare failed dive
the day before, won the spring-
board event Tuesday, launching
himself toward an unprecedent-
ed double—double. '

”I knew I was going to have to
be strong,” said Louganis, who
hit his head on the board in
qualifying and spun into the
water like a downed Spitfire. ”I

was really scared.”
With the platform event com-

ing up next week, Louganis is

now pointing toward a second
straight sweep, something no
diver has ever done in an
Olympics.

The U.S. basketball team used
a defensive pressure that has be-
come the trademark of Coach
John Thompson of Georgetown
to wear down Brazil. Brazil led
38-37 with 7:34 to play in the first
half, but that's when the United
States defense went to work. J.R.
Reid led the Americans with 16
points, 14 in the first half, and
Danny Manning and Dan Majer-
le had 12 each.

Brazil's Oscar Schmidt had 31
points, but that was nine off his

Olympic average, and Thompson

saidhis players were sick of hear-

ing about the Brazilian star.
”This team was Oscared to

death,” the coach said.

The U.S. basketball team com-
pleted what was a relatively
strong day for America at the
Olympics. Going to a weapon
not known to be heavily stocked
in its arsenal, the 3-point goal, the
U.S. team beat Canada 76-70 for
its second straight victory.

The Soviets won five medals
Tuesday, four gold, to run their
leading total to 11, including six
gold. China has seven medals,
one gold, and Bulgaria has six,
three gold. The United States was
fourth with five medals, two gold.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, September 21, 1988

 

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

The Pitt Panther soccer team
will take on archrival West Vir-
ginia tonight at 7:15 p.m. at Pitt
Stadium.

The Mountaineers are 19-9-1
lifetime against the Panthers. In-
cluded in those 19 wins is a
12-season unbeaten streak
against Pitt. Last year, WVU tri-
umphed in a 2-0 victory in Mor-
gantown. This year, the Panthers
hope to return the favor.

Thus far this season, the Moun-
taineers are 0-4, having scored
only two goals. Freshman John

1 Keating owns both netters.
Sophomore Wayne Morgan,
WVU’s leading scorer last season
with nine goals, has been stuffed
so far this season, although he re-
mains an offensive threat.

Pitt soccer team _ho_peS ‘E
to break West Virginia
12-year winning streak

WVU has lost to James Madi-
son, Penn State, George Mason
and American University — four
extremely strong soccer schools.

The Mountaineers should bring
stiff competition for Coach Joe
Luxbacher’s young squad, which
is in dire need of a potent scor-
ing attack. Usually, WVU is one
ofthe last games of the season for
Pitt. It seems especially fitting this
year that they are coming to town
so early, because the Panthers are
in a difficult stretch of their sched-
ule. They have already faced Slip-
pery Rock and Bucknell. After
WVU, they play at Ohio State on
Sunday — no day at the beach,
by any means.

Luxbacher feels that the Pitt-
WVU rivalry and the fact that the
Panthers have not beaten the
Mountaineers in 12 years will not
be in the back of his players’
minds.

”Most of the guys haven't been
around that long, and so they're
not really thinking about it.
Maybe some of the second- and
third-year players are a little up
for this because they've been
through one or two defeats
against this team,” Luxbacher
said.

Luxbacher expects a strong
defensive struggle tonight, and a
solid game by defensemen John
Ascher and Dan Liberati will be
crucial for success.

' ’’I expect a tough team. West
Virginia is always a good game.
I think we are prepared,” Lux-
bacher said.

If both teams display the kind
of offensive scoring attack that
they have demonstrated thus far
this season, it's going to be a low-
scoring affair. Hopefully, the Pan-
thers will start putting the ball in
the net.

Olympics-

The Soviets got their final gold
of the day when their male gym-
nasts won the team title, led by
the three perfect scores of world
champion Dmitri Bilozerchev.
East Germany won the silver,
Japan the bronze, and the Unit-
ed States finished 11th out of 12
teams.

In a display of utter power, the
Soviets scored at least one 10 in
five of the six, events, missing out
only in the vault. They finished
with 593.350, while East Germa-
ny had 588.450 and Japan
585.600.

The United States did get into
position for a couple more me-
dals in swimming, where Janet
Evans already has a gold and Matt
Biondi a bronze.

Biondi, of Moraga, Calif., came
to the Games wanting seven
golds, like Mark Spitz in 1972.
Now, he'll settle for seven of any
variety, although he could well
win gold Wednesday in the 100
butterfly. Biondi won his heat in
the butterfly Tuesday, and he also
was scheduled to swim the an-
chor leg in the 800 freestyle re-
lay Wednesday.
