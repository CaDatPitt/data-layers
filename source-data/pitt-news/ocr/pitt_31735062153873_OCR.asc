The students of the-. University

as chief speaker for. their Chaigter Day
celebration Prof. Hugh Black,«4of
Union Theological Seminary, New

Gentle Art of Reading”-—of reading,

sﬁke of study,‘but for the sake of the.
joy which reading can bring. ,,He -told
ﬁrst what to read -— only old: books.
only famous books, and——w_hatever
you like. As to actual books,’~he re-
fused to',rec mmend '.any;, for, as he
says ,each n/e must iﬁnd his favorites
for himself, W . A

Proceeding -next t_Q,'how_ .to read;
Pr-of. Black gave two -‘general rules;
Read with humiality; that is, reed with
reﬂectinon; do not be critical, but be
ready to see and appreciate the

the ibiggestiof intellectual forces. Nor,
is it necessary to read -a_ great -niany

plans of the Committee were ﬁnally

form of a complete elimination of
