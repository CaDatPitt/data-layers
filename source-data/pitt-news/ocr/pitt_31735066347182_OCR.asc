Dorm Student Group Lee Voices Nyden Support
Forms ‘Body Patrol’ I  

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

A campus escort system, billed as '

a body patrol, will be established in
the next two weeks to help start a
campus wide safety campaign,
according to Jack McElwee, the
Resident Student Association board
representative on the Residence
Life security committee. -

The system will attempt to
provide women resident students
with lists of persons willing to serve
as escorts. The lists will be
compiled according . to available
times for escort and according to
dorms.

“Our main objectives are to alert
students to the crime problems on
campus and to protect women from
getting harassed on their way to the
library or to a late evening class,”
RSA programming chairman Ann
Robinson said. a ' . .

J oAnn Gibbs, assistant director
for the Ofﬁce of Residence Life, said
it is part of an overall effort to make
campus residents more security
conscious. -

“We are trying to promote a

Carter's

BY BILL MOORE
President Gerald R. Ford, in a

brief Pittsburgh campaign appear-
_ance yesterday, termed Democratic
nominee Jimmy Carter’s foreign
policy ‘ ‘potentially dangerous.’ ’
Ford spoke before members of
the Economics Club of Pittsburgh
andilater met brieﬂy with Pitt
running back, Tony Dorsett and

coach Johnny Majors before _

boarding Air Force One. (See story,
page 18.) .
In his speech, Ford claimed
_Carter’s positions on global strat-
egy pose a threat to world peace and
the ‘ ‘strong, durable relationships”
Ford has- established with allied
nations. V
Ford charged Carter’s campaign
speeches have “a strong ﬂavor of
isolationism. ’ ’

“If it is applied in practice in the ‘

same way that it" is described in
campaign oratory,” Ford said,
“there is a signiﬁcant risk it could
lead to major international crises.”
Ford maintained that his admin-
istration had led the world out of a
recession, injected new strength
into the Atlantic alliance with
Europe, made signiﬁcant progress
in the Middle East and improved
relations with Japan and China.
“In place of a strong defense, the
alternative called for in this
is a weakened defense,” Ford said.

dents to take it upon‘ themselves to
travel the campus in groups after
dark,” Gibbs said.

According to McElwee, body
patrol escorts will carry identiﬁca-
tion cards identifying them as such.

They also will be required to carry '

their student ID, which has a
resident sticker.

Robinson stressed women should
only allow themselves to be
escorted when the two cards are
presented. McElwee said as an
additional precaution, women
should call only those men on the
lists with whom they are familiar.

McElwee said anyone interested
in being an escort should see their
resident assistant (RA). Those
interested in the body patrol will be
screened by the RA and the security
committee, he said.

“Most girls I talked to expressed

A concern at having to be out late at

night and I think the escort system
will alleviate these fears,” Mc-
Elwee said.

The security committeewill, meet
at 3 p.m. Friday in the Tower A
conference room to further discuss
the body patrol. '

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

The past president of the
American Sociological Association
(ASA), which passed a disputed
resolution in support of Assistant
Sociology Professor Paul Nyden’s
claim that his tenure was denied
because of his Marxist philosophy,
voiced his support for Nyden at a
press conference Monday. -

ASA President Alfred McClun
Lee cited the Nyden case as part of
a trend in American affairs that
could be considered a very
“sophisticated McCarthyism,
which we must ﬁght with all might
and main. _

“If we continue to build racism,
orthodoxy, and deny academic
freedom, we would destroy this

A country and turn it into an ant

hill,” Dr. Lee said at a news
conference Monday.

A resolution passed at the Sept.
1 general business meeting of the
ASA charged Nyden was denied
tenure because of his political

.views and activities. -The resolu-

tion also called, for the release of
secret memos giving the reasons
for the tenure denial, and
demanding that Nyden be given a
second three-year contract as

' assistant professor.

The resolution now must go to
the ASA council for further action,
according to Lee.

Policy Dangerous

ramiﬁcations for United States foreign policy in a speech in Pittsburgh

The unreleased memos should
be given to a group of people
representing a variety of view-
points including members of the
American Federation of Teachers
(AFT), the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) and
the ASA to check their validity,
according to Lee.

‘‘It seems to me, secrecy has no
place in this matter,” Lee said.
“Dr. Nyden himself has requested
the memos be made public and he
has the most to lose. Those who
claim to have the best case don't
want them public.”

The ASA meeting at which the
Nyden resolution was passed was
very well publicized, according to
Lee, but "no representative of the
University attended".

“The fact that the University of
Pittsburgh’ had no representative at

our business meeting makes me -

suspicious," Lee said. “Several
times we called for a speaker from
the University but they didn’t come

to the podium.”

Unemployment Policy.

BY MREA CSORBA

Democratic vice presidential

candidate Walter Mondale, here '

Monday with plans to do some labor
campaigning at the Duquesne U.S.
Steel plant gate, missed the early
morning change of shifts, and shook
hands with only a few hurrying
stragglers.

Later, at a breakfast meeting with
United Steelworkers union local
leaders and some of the Duquesne
plant's laid-off employes, he once
again found disappointing num-
bers. Only one of the three long
banquet tables laid out for the
meeting was ﬁlled by U.S. Steel
employes. A

Despite the day’s low turn-out,
Mondale listened sympathetically
to the woes of the steel town whose
major industry is currently employ-
ing only 1,700 of its 5000 workers.

Mondaleaccused President Ford
of painting a rosy picture of
a subsiding unemployment prob-

g lem, even though unemployment is

up 50% since he took office.

V “That means for every 10
workers that stood in the unemploy-
ment line in ’74, there are 15
standing there now,” Mondale
said.

“It's not only the steel industry
that is effected this way; the whole
economy is soft. And if this is the
best Ford can give us around
election time, think what’ the’
situation will be after elections,”

-Mondale said. .

In the press conference following
the breakfast,» Mondale said he

would push for more flow of credit to .
Jindiustries’ crippled bygthe ypiresenty

.. aw ..

monetary freeze. “In Cleveland" the ‘
building trade is 40% unemployed.
The Federal Reserve Board should ..

loosen its monetary policy t _

activate these industries.” 
Mondale also said that though h

preferred beeﬁng up employment

..through private industry, public
works in sewage and highway _

construction could be initiated. _
The senator from Minnesota said
any trend toward a 30-hour week for
40 hours pay is an experiment that

shouldn’t be tried until everyone is -

back to work.

Ford Says

 

Carter's Polic

(Continued from Paye I)

“In place of strong alliances, we are
offered troop pullbacks and sweep-
ing reviews of America's commit-
ment to its allies.”

Ford repeated the criticism he
made in last Friday’s presidential
debate of Carter’s statement that he
would never sent troops to
Yugoslavia. “American presidents
have always known they should
never say in advance precisely what
course of action this country would
take in the event of an international
crisis,” Ford said. “The reason for

such an approach should be very '

obvious. ”

He said that Carter had limited-

his ﬂexibility in the event such an
international crisis should arise
during a Carter presidency. Ford
also criticized his opponent for
saying he would implement ‘‘total
economic warfare against the Arabs
in the event of another embargo.”

Despite America being at peace
presently, Ford continued, the
potential for military crisis still
exists. “Unrest is still seething in
many parts of the globe,” he said.

“This is not a time to weaken our
own defense, to refuse to equip our
troops with essential new weapons,
to undermine democratic leaders by
hinting at new relationships with
communist leaders in Western
Europe, to withdraw our troops
from South Korea, to upset the
balance in the Middle East or to

‘I concede such nations as Yugoslavia
A to the Soviet sphere,” the President

said. » , '

Ford toured a "steel mill in
Aliquippa following his speech‘,
then traveled to the militarj

. installation at Greater Pittsburgl
" International Airport where he left
for Chicago to continue his

last-minute campaign effort.

“The main issue in the Nyden

PA Community Concern 

‘\\;.

An assistant gymnastic coach came to the PIttNews ofﬁce theother
day with a warning for other students.

While walking down the hill from the Trees Hall gym last Thursday,
someone tried to mug him on Darragh Street. A young male tackled
him, kicked him, unsuccessfully tried to take his wallet and ran. The
coach called the police who, although slowto arrive, were very thorough.

So he asked us to alert people to the danger. He wanted students to
recognize the lack ofsecurity on the hill between the main campus and
Trees Hall. If students knew what they faced, they might be more
cautious on trips up there, he said. A more serious incident could have
occurred if the mugger hadn’t chanced to tangle with an assistant

_.....—...._.

‘ ‘meaning of the word.

   

gynmastics coach.

He came to inform, not to complain or criticize.

“I didn’t want to sit

back and let this happen again. I want people to know how unsafe it is to

walk down that hill,” he said.

The Campus Police force does commendable work here at Pitt. But
the force cannot cover all street corners all of the time. They have no
crystal ball to tell them where a crime will occur.

This is where responsibility falls on student shoulders. Community
awareness is an extremely eﬁective crime deterrent, and no crime will
be eliminated until the community realizes who is committing it and

where it occurs.

If a student recognizes a particular trouble area, they should not
apathetically shrug it oﬁ. Instead they should alert fellow students
through word of mouth or any other charmel.

The Campus Police are receptive to constructive criticism from

students.

So is the Office of Residence Life and the University

administration. These are the authorities who can improve unsafe

campus areas.

But the student needn’t stop there. The city can improve unsafe
conditionsinOakland. Theycanirnprove lighting conditions here. They
can increase city police patrols here. But they won't act until the
problem comes to their attention. So write to the mayor, write to city
council and complain. It is. the only way to force them into action.

Itstilltakestimetosetthose groupsintomotion. Until then itisupto

thestudents to keep each other informed.
If enough follow the example of the assistant

gynmastics coach,

students can stay informed enough to avoid trouble until the puzzle of

campus security has been resolved.

   Is Soviet Support an Asset?

 BY DAN MULHOLLAND

There is an old saying which
goes “Show me who your.friends
are and l’l1 show you who you are."

 The truth of that adage was
._ demonstrated a few weeks ago

when associate sociology professor
Paul Nyden revealed that he is
being supported by the Kremlin in

‘ his bid to retain his teaching

position. The Nyden case has
created quite a ﬂap at Pitt in recent
weeks and the professor has
succeeded in enlisting a number of
individuals and organizations in his
“crusade.”

But the most recent additions to
this list, the Soviets, make Nyden
and his “student committee” seem

I like a small but vocal band of red_

agitators whose sole purpose is to
sow dissention and strife through-

I  out the University community.

.~_,lt seems strange that a man who

* claims to be ﬁghting for academic

freedom would take pride in the fact

I that he is backed by a government

when they can use it to their own
advantage by creating confusions
and controversy in the free world,
as they are attempting to do in the
Nyden case.

The very nature of the Soviet

regime, with its forced labor camps .

and religious persecution is enough
reason to reject their defense of
Nyden and his revolutionary
teachings. But even if one‘ is
ideologically in tune with them, it
cannot be denied that a hostile
foreign government should not be
able to impose its will on, or even
influence, the decisions of the
University of Pittsburgh. To permit
that would make mockery of the
academic freedom that Nyden
claims to hold so dear.

And yet, that is just what is being
allowed to occur. Some University
officials are reportedly afraid that a
proposed exchange program with
the U.S.S.R. will be jeopardized by

the Nyden contoversy. In the ﬁrst.

place, the program should have
never been considered, in light of
Soviet aggression abroad (e.g.
Czechoslovakia, Angola, etc.) as

the Jews, Ukrainians, etc.). But
even if one could make a plausible
argument in favor of the exchange
program, there would be all the
more reason not -to buckle under to

.Soviet pressure. in the Nyden case, if ,

BY BILL MOORE

There is hardly a more proper
forum for battle than the Letters to
the Editor section of the University
Times, but even that bastion. of
propriety has fallen prey to the
evils of the Nyden controversy.

That is an impartial comment, for
the evils of the Nyden controversy
stem not from Nyden, nor his
unfriendly colleagues, but from the
nature of the battle itself.

BEHIND THE LINES

The Nyden controversy now is a
battle of blunders, and reputations,
not issues. Like the current
presidential campaign, the cam-
paigns for and against Paul Nyden,
the assistant» sociology professor
playing David to the University's
Goliath, has been reduced to petty
charges and countercharges.

Except for isolated incidents, the
two sides have given up worrying
about who is a proper scholar, and
have sunk to the level of pinning

manner in which it is being
conducted. _
By dragging the controversy out
over several semesters, the Univer-
sity has unwittingly left itself open
to an incessant barrage of mindless
criticism from every two-bit Trot-
skyite in the area. It has also
provided the local news media with
an opportunity to blow the situation
far out7oflproportion.- _ .

The only way to‘ reverse f this . -
unfortunate chain of events is to-

bring the Nyden case to‘ a speedy
conclusion. , And in doing so‘, the
University must not give in to veiled
‘threats by the Soviets or any other
outside group. Otherwise, a most
shameful precedent will have been
set. .

balme for obscenities scrawled on
Mervis‘ Hall bathroom walls.

In the Oct. 21 issue of the
University Times, sociology faculty
members John H. Mark, John
Markoff, Jerome Laulicht, C.K.
Yand and Gilbert Shapiro, waste a
full column of type to blast Nyden
for insinuating that the Pitt
Professional Union (PPU) support-
ed Nyden, rather than merely
Nyden’s right to a fair trial. That is
a valid distinction, but not
important enough to merit the
controversy that has ensued.

The same for the next two points

raised. by the ﬁve sociology faculty .

members about Nyden’s supposed
claims of support from two of his
fellow professors. Minor points
should be clariﬁed but not made the
basis of a ﬁring dispute. I I
Nyden, deﬁnitely,_ is not without
fault in all of ‘this. To his credit, he
has called these minute points
irrelevant. But he should realize the

Pitts Battle of Blunders 

equal irrelevancy of many minor
points he raised in his four hour
discourse before the FAS Tenure
and Promotion Review Board.

The name-calling campaign
being carried on by the Student
Committee to Defend Paul Nyden,
as associate professor Jose Moreno
pointed out in his letter to the
University Times, is where the
Nyden side looks the worst.

Moreno’s advice should be
heeded, and the discussion of the
Nyden case should be limited to the
substantive issues—scholarly com-
petence, professional behavior and
teaching ability.

The FAS Tenure and Review
Board, responsible Letters to the
Editor and even pamphleteering,
when responsibility done, are valid
ways to resolve this. s

Slanders, slurs, accusations and
name-calling are not and only serve
to make matters worse.

Which is why we are where we
are now. '

Letter: Tenure System

Dear Dr. Posvar:

There are about a dozen real,
fully constitutionalized universities
in this country. Pittsburghis not
among them. In the constitutional
university tenured appointments
' are limited, and they are made
through open competition. _ We

on in this manner, there is no
prospect of - “national and interna-

of Arts and Sciences a proposal, to

Why Not Study
‘|l|ogica|' Occult?

Professor Robert Wolke’s letter
shows with beautiful irony the
unconsciously hypocritical position
taken by so many scientific people.

The utilitarian benefits of science
are so obvious that it is easy to
overlook science’s short-comings in
explaining the nature of the world.
Throughout history, there has
always been a “pop counter
culture" aware of the limited scope
in rational andlogical thought. So
why should we today not study this
‘irrational’ and ‘illogical’ search?
When science has objectively
studied and given a concise casual
explanation for every aspect of
existence, then scientists can feel
safe when it is said they have freed
the human spirit from the esoteric
needs. Until then, what better place
than the university is there to
inquire into ‘non-reality’ as well as
science and rationality?

Registration Push

ls Not Wrong

It seems that many people
reading the Pitt News these days
have become very involved with the
Massey letter or those three very
unfortunate rapes. However if

anyone had noticed a certain article I

on the bottom of the editorial page
in the Oct. 8 issue I'm sure they
would have become embroiled in
that too. The article was called,
“Don’t Seek- the Vote of the
Politically Ignorant” by Casey
Baer. I think this is the most
pretentious piece of journalism I’ve
read in a long time.

Casey Baer seems to feel that the
kind of voter registration that took
place here at Pitt several seeks ago
was wrong, Why? Because she
contends that 62% or 90 million
people are “politically ignorant...
and ethically have no ‘right to

vote.” Who is she to claim that 90 ’

million ‘Americans are politically-
ignorant? And‘ Where. Pray tell: 15
this documented? She also says

‘that in-the”_72 election, only 38% ‘of

the eligible voters did vote, “the
remaining 62’/3 most of whom are
politically ignorant, and many of
whom are illiterate, theoretically
could have put Donald Duck in
off1ce....” I don’t think she
realizes that the 38% who did vote
in '72 put someone in office who
was dumber than Donald Duck,
Richard Nixon.

Obviously Casey Baer has a
totally intolerant, prejudiced and
unfounded attitude toward a
majority of the population. In her
own words, “Those masses of
political illiterates...don't go to the
polls because they do ”not feel
secure that they have evolved to a
point of sophistication at which

they could cast an_ intelligent
vote...The crucial decision“ to be
made in November is too important
to be made by people who don't
know and don't care what the
future of the nation should be.”

The more I read the article the
more I would like to believe it is a
satire. But I can’t help but believe
Casey Baer sincerely means what
she is saying. If she does, I think
all of us should sit up and take
notice because her attitude is
almost dangerous. —Woe to society
if she represents a sizable number
of people.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Casey Baer is
male.

able students. We cannot survive
as a “research university. With

realism and reason The Plan points
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
toward terminal Master of Arts
degrees.

The ideology of the “tenure
stream” engages us in moral
enormity. Not only because justice
dictates that all positions in society
be open’ to competition, as John
Rawls has so forcefully reminded
us. The principle of academic
freedom itself is the shape
assumed by equality of opportunity
within our university system, as
Taloott Parson points out in his
great book on The American
‘University. We lie, therefore,
under both a general and a special

obligation to eliminate any internal

purely academic criteria in tenured
appointments. We cannot accord a
person the “right" to be consi-
déred to the exclusion of others, to
be appointed if he meets a
“standard," not because he excels
in competition. The very legiti-
macy of academic tenure depends
upon our strict adherence to the
principle of competitive merit.

Has the time not come, Dr.
Posvar, for you to assume
responsibility and to assert your
authority to make Pittsburgh a real
university? The national and
international implications of your
doing so would be salutary in the
extreme.

__P_rofessor of Political Science

I think the nine professors were
juistified in their concern over
Associate Provost Robert Nossen’s
course description. Whether
intended or not, the description did
convey the impression that witch-
craft, etc., may offer answers to
questions of how we can” account
for certain" patterns of human
behavior. Such an impression can
easily be conveyed to prospective
students. If the nine professors
have brought about a clariﬁcation
by Nossen, then they have
performed a service and they
should not be castigated for
intolerance.

A study of alchemy, astrology,
witchcraft, etc., as historical
phenomena might make a very
interesting course in _t_he history of

You can do it, too. So far almost 1,000,000 people

Those sororities have their own

noisy affairs, and I for one am not
amused, when my studying is
disrupted by groups of rowdy
women singing and cheering at the
top of their lungs in the Quad. No
windows or walls can shut out that
annoyance, and I feel it is my basic
right to study in my room without
having to go to the library because
of noise outside the dormitories.
The sirens and trafﬁc are bad
enough, but that cannot be
controlled. There are quiet hours in
each dorm after 8 p.m. This should
at least carry over to inconsiderate
people who decide to publicize their

activities in the Quad with the result -

of disturbing every resident whose
room faces that area.

Sororities should condier this
complaint seriously. Ifail to realize

Strict Pot Laws '

Benefit No One

I’m writing this letter in grateful
response to your Sept. 17 editorial,
“Blowing Smoke?’,’ I was both
pleased and proud to see that my
school newspaper has the courage

' to speak out in full favor of the

Student Government Board's at-
tempt at persuading the _.Pennsyl-
vania Legislature to change this
‘state's outdated marijuana laws.

Your point about there being no
benefit in maintaining a law that is
widely ignored, far too strict, and
one that makes most of us criminals,
is absolutely true. Everyone,
including state legislators, knows
the truth about marijuana and I
ﬁrmly agree that it will take strongly
supported, active coalitions such as
the SGB to get these ridiculous laws
-changed.

Decriminalization of marijuana is
obviously a very controversial issue
and I am sure that your stand in
favor of it will be a very positive

’ force for any student organization

wishing’ to persuade the state to
repeal the present laws. You are as
much a representative of the views
of the student population as the
SGB or any other group and I am
convinced that by speaking out in

'0.

4'1

—o'

favor of decriminalization you have ’

_, conveyed a feeling that has been in ,

the minds of most of us for a long
time.

No one wants to be considered a
criminal for doing something that is
not morally. medically or in any
other way wrong. The changing of
the present Pennsylvania marijuana
laws is a must and by supporting
groups that are pushing for these
changes, you the Pltt News, are to
be commended.

I know his name and even fewer know

-what his real job is at Pitt. But

. thanks to him, many a lost soul has

been saved from bewildered

wandering through the Cathedral of I
A. Learning’s ground floor.

Registration time is a busy time of

year for him when ﬂocks of
. freshmen frantically try to find the

‘registrar's office in the maze of the

"Cathedral’s ground ﬂoor corridors.

Sometimes they are bold enough
to ask for help, but Jones can often

. sense their confusion; and say,
. “G-17. Down here (he'll point) and
._to the right." «

For those who haven’t guessed by

‘now, Bill Jones is the.,“elevator

T~_,Although" he is‘ bestifkirown for

giving directions and information,

 real job is to make sure the
« elevators are in good order.

‘if an elevator isn't operating

" properly, and if I feel it's not safe,’ ’
‘he said, “it's my job tohelp people

which grossed over one million
dollars.

Deducting labor, material and
other operations] expenses, Gibson
missed the million dollar personal
proﬁts mark. But he predicts sales
will escalate to at least four million
by Christmas, making him a
millionaire several times over.

Gibson also is peddling unisex
Nurd t-shirts selling at ﬁve dollars a
piece and bumperstickers for 75

cents ﬂaunting slogans such as

“Don’t take Nurds for Granite!”
and “Be sensuous, sit on a Nurd.”

Since the Nurd is as much a
commercial venture as it is fun or a
political parody, the irrelevance of
the slogans to the campaign doesn’t
matter. Nurds sell.

Gibson believes Nurd’s strength
is in the sexual appeal of his
symbolically phallic physique.

“Several of my college aged
employes on_the Nurd Farm insist
their sex lives have improved since
they began molding Nurds,”
Gibson said. “We hire people
between the ages of 18 and 28
because they can make Nurds
faster. It must be libido.”

ls thatdan effective sales pitch, or
is that an effective sales pitch?

Gibson Productions, Inc. has
established franchises in Canada
and Australia with the Penny and

A

Sears ‘ Corporations retailing.
According to Gibson, distributors in
England are eagerto bring the Nurd
to Europe.

“The Pet Rock Corp. began
distribution about a year before us
and sold nothing the ﬁrst three
months of production,” Gibson
said. “Nurds already are selling
faster than that.”

Gibson conceeded the Nurd is a
take off on the pet rock craze.

Several celebrities have agreed to
promote Nurd.

Bionic woman Lindsey Wagner
soon will have a specially designed
Nurd t-shirt to wear when she
distributes Nurds in various child-
ren’s hospitals. Lawrence Welk will
present a Nurd to the host of AM
America in the near future. Move-
over, interviews of both Gibson'and
Nurd have been set up with Johnny
Carson, Dinah Shore and Merv
Grifﬁn. ,

Gibson said it was easier than he
had anticipated to persuade friends
and relatives to support his venture,
with in-laws and parents boggling

’ the 10 stockholding positions in the

closed corporation. It could be said
Gibson Productions, Inc. is a family
affair. ' '
Gibson’s brother . dropped the
_real estate business to become the
vice president of Nurd marketing.
The brother of Gibson’s main

distributor, Tonr Adams of Tom’

Adams Diversiﬁed located in Santa
ana, Calif., dropped police work to
take the Nurd plunge.

Further, Gibson’s wife created
the ﬁrst Nurd around a campﬁre on
a cold California desert night when
Gibson was researching the effects
of noise on King Brew rats’ ears.

“The rats would come around the
ﬁre and ravage food," Gibson said.
“So my wife made a two foot Nurd
out of her ceramics clay to scare
them away. It worked.

“Of course, usually we don’t tell
people the rain kept the pests away
that night,” he said.

“Then the Nurd became a rain
God. And on and on and on...,”
Gibson said.

The Nurd ﬁxation grew until
Gibson established the Nurd Farm
where Nurds are hand molded and
wrote the Nurd book to round out
individual perception of the Nurd.

“Nurds are a primitve, nearly.

extinct species of critters found in
the deepest deserts of“ the world.
Their Latin (scientiﬁc) name as
recorded in ancient books is
Udummies buyus,” Gibson said.

“There is little known about the
history of Nurds, since they appear
only every 127 years. This has lead
some of -the world’s leading desert
scientists to believe that this may
possibly be a mating period for the
Nurds,” he added.

Nurds can be toilet trained,
petted, coddled and cooed, bathed
and fed, according to Gibson.

“Nurds are great listeners and
you will ﬁnd they will never talk
back toryou,” Gibson said.

“They will give you emotional
support when you are in a crowd of
people you don’t know.

“They love to swim, although
they sink like a rock.” And that's

not all Nurds do.

After the election, Gibson plans
to introduce pregnant Nurds to the
world.

As far as his sights are set,,

Gibson says next semester he will
resume teaching at California State,
toast a few with the tie and coat crew
there, and live off the proﬁts he has
reaped (ripped off) from the Nurd.

Dispacs Elevators, Information  

5‘.

I ‘Everyone knows Bill Jones, even if they don’

_the Cathedral’s elevator dispatcher who spends as much time giving lost

souls directions as he does taking care of the elevators.

Jones then calls the passengers
through an intercom system to ﬁnd
out what the problem is and, if
necessary, he can notify the
Campus Police. After normal
working hours, Jones explained,
any alarms go straight to the police
station.

According to Jones. people don’t
often get stuck in the elevators and
he never has experienced any
tragedies on the job. But the alarm
buttons sometimes are pushed
accidentally. “When I ﬁnd there
are no problems,” he said, ‘‘I just
shutjt off." ,1 ‘

Originally from Louisville, Ky.,
Jones came to Pittsburgh in 1942.

‘ ‘Several different things” kept
him " from his. ‘childhood dream of

     

Mudrick photo
becoming a policeman,‘ so I he

worked as an auto mechanic for a 
while before landing a job at Pitt in 1

1957. “Dec. 9, 1957,” he said, “to
be exact."  ’ ‘

1 Thanks to the recommendation of

a chauffeur who was leaving at the

‘time, Jones ‘spent ﬁve and a half
years driving for former Chancellor

Edward Litchﬁeld before ending up V

in the elevator department, where
he has been for the last 13 years.

Jones started out as an elevator
operator, running the cars manual-

.ly, and so had some difﬁculty

getting used to the system when it

became automated about six years
‘ ago. ‘I " ‘

. “We had, to get the bugs, out,

 

which is normal_ for any new piece of
equipment,” he said. “But as I
went along -I learned quite a few
little schemes that I wouldn’t tell
anybody else.’I

He did confess, though, that the
trick is in the way he operates the
dispatch board. If a trouble signal
shows up through a blinking light on
the panel, the many switches enable
him to do various things.

For example, if a car should get
stuck, he explained, “We’ll open
the door,'or move the car to a ﬂoor

where it will open on its own,. then I
ask the people to get out and _
‘ proceed to a safer ﬂoor.” " '

o Another responsibility Jones has

.. as elevator dispatcher is giving

information and assistance to

. University offices that call_him on

the service phone. " “Lots of times
they feel 'thatf"’Ii’m"nthe clb‘é‘e’stT—and“
best information they can‘ get,” he‘
said. 1 . - * ~ "

But University ofﬁces aren’t the
only ones who come to Jones for
help. Visitors and students alike are
constantly getting lost, and the
“closest and best information that
they can get” usually comes to the
rescue. . 7

: “My job is dispatching, but
sometimes 1 think it’s walking
information.” Jones said. “I give a
lot of information, such as where's
this and where's that. l‘ve been

asked things from how to get out of 1
the building to how to get to Chicago

or New York..?’.  ’ i .

       
 

. ¢1¢va.t0r..=.T..f"

. \".'.~

The constant barrage of ques-
tions he's faced doesn’t bother him,
and he ﬁnds people, for the most
part, friendly. But he has to laugh
at some of the people-who come
back once or twice before they get

1 their directions straight.

“Someone asked me once where
G-47 was,” he said, “and I told
them. ’ ‘First dooraon your right.’
Now from where I was standing, you
had to pass the elevators ﬁrst to
reach G-47, and I.don’t consider
the elevators a door, but that person
came back and “said, ‘That’s‘?an

And it will comfortmsome to know

-that many people seem to be
confused ‘over (which ﬂoors the

elevators stop on. ‘ ‘I've had‘ people
come andlook up’ over the door of
the elevator and ask me how to get

‘i’ to 27’ when there_’s ‘27’gr_ight,_over

-3, According to Jones, are

people who can't ‘understand why
the elevators 'don’t stop on every

" floor, like one person who wanted to

go to the seventh. “He got on the
elevator and went up to eight,”
Jones said, “and came all the way
back down and asked- me why it
didn't stop at seven."

A favorite situation of his is when
people board an elevator that makes
its ﬁnal stop on the cathedral’s 18th
floor. Instead of waiting for a car
that would take them directly to a

~ higher ﬂoor, he explained, they get
off on 18 and wait for .a higher

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

There have been plenty of
girl-meets-boy movies to show us
how the dating game is supposed to
work. But sometimes it needs a
little outside help—from a friend,
from Cupid or from a commercial
dating service.

Whether the dating service uses a
computer-coded personality proﬁle
or a personal interview, whether it
costs $25 or $500, most of the
matches are based on clients’
physical characteristics, occupa-
tions, educational levels, interests
and attitudes.

Spokesmen at most local dating
services, and there are about 10 in
the Greater Pittsburgh area, claim
they have customers in all age
brackets, but most say the largest
group of customers are in their 20s
and 30s.

“The ideal time for meeting

people is when you are in school,”
says Abraham Falk, who operates
the Helen Leeds Introductory
“When you’re working,
you see the same people all of the
time.”

But students at Penn State
University probably would dis-
agree. Last winter term the
undergraduate student government
offered a computer match service
students for $3.50. It
guaranteed at least three dates and
threw in a book of coupons
redeemable at area merchants as a
bonus. The 4,485 students who
entrusted a computer with their love

lives must have been satisfied. A
similar program is being planned
for this year and should be under
way by mid-December.

Former Penn State student
Marian Ulicny of Greensburg tried
Penn State’s service.

“The winter term is always
boring at Penn State,” she says. “I
did it on a dare. No one went into it
expecting to ﬁnd a great match;
they just did it to liven up winter
term.”

Marian says she met most of the
12 “eligibles” the computer sent
her, but she only dated a few of
them.

The reasons people decide to go
to commercial dating services vary
widely, according to most company
spokesmen.

“Some of them just broke _up and '

are really depressed, some are new
in town and some are just interested
in getting out with someone,”
according to Denise Walley, a

.22-year-old who operates Dollar

Dates in West Mifﬂin.

When Walley talks with prospec-
tive customers, she asks them to
mail information to her and she
makes matches based on it. She
charges $30 for six months of
service and guarantees one match.

Jerry Putnins, general manager
of Comdates, a computer service
based in Milwaukee, Wis., says
“some customers are looking for
marriage and others say ‘give me all
the dates you can.’ It’s something
new to them. We get a wide range

of people—they may be just curious

' or lonely."

Comdates maintains no ofﬁces
here, just an answering service
from which questionnaires are
mailed out. The ﬁrm operates 14
such branches, according to Put-
nins.

“That's all you really need.
Everything else is handled by mail,
and the computers and our general
offices are here in Milwaukee.”

Comdates charges $25 for a
one-year membership and guaran-
tees two dates per month. Putnins
said his form does not use personal
interviews because that would
greatly increase the cost of the
service.

Falk, who has been introducing
people at Helen Leeds for 25 years,
considers the personal interview a
very important part of his service.

“One thing the computer can’t do
is match people. The personality
factors are missing,” he says. “I
can’t even be sure after talking with
someone for half an hour (Falk
requires a personal interview), but I
get an impression. I can at least
determine if this is going to be a
pleasant evening.”

During a 12-month membership,
which costs $175, Falk guarantees

Wednesday, October 27, 1976—THE PITT NEWS—Page 9

Commercial Dating Services Give Cupid A Nudge

customers three matches. If three
dates can’t be arranged during that
period, the membership is extend-
ed.

Compatibility Dating, Inc., a
Greensburg firm, offers several
dating plans which vary in price.
One plan, which costs $495 for 18
months and $595 for 36 months,
includes interviews, testing and
background investigation of clients.
A subsidiary ﬁrm operates entirely

by mail and costs $29 for three»

months.

One Helen Leeds client (all asked
that their names not be used), a
23-year-old former model, expres-
sed a view shared by many people
who use dating services.

‘ ‘I thought it was probably kind of
goofy to pay a fee for a date,” she
says. “The ﬁrst time I saw anything
about it, Iﬁgures it was a crazy idea.
Then, later, my father called it to my
attention, so it was really his idea.’ ’

“The dates are kind of screened
for you,” she explains. “I didn’t
join for a husband. It’s a good club,
instead of going to bars or church

clubs.”

Falk says the “screening” is
important because “if you find an
interest in a person, » you’re not
going to learn something about the
person later that changes it. All

you have to do is feel that spark.”

Another woman in her late 20s
who holds an executive position
with a Pittsburgh ﬁrm, says, “In my
profession I don’t have time to go
around and play the bar game. I
can’t stand crowds and don't like
picking up people.”

She has been using Fa1k’s service
for five years and has been
introduced to more than 25 people.
‘‘I was apprehensive at ﬁrst, as you
are with any blind date. Nothing
has come of it, but I’ve met nice
people. They take you to nice
places.” T

Several men and women say they
decided to start using dating
services because they just weren't
meeting any new people through
their work or friends.

One couple who met through a
dating service and recently became
engaged say “we have a standing
joke that we bought each other for
$175."

Others are not as satisﬁed with
the service they get for their money.

Thomas Conley of the Better
Business Bureau said the bureau
receives complaints periodically
from customers, though there have
been fewer complaints this year
than in the past.

  I   Jones Directs Lost Souls

‘‘lose'’ a person, especially the
elevators. Why different cars stop
on different ﬂoors, and why they
stop on the floors they do are good
examples, not to mention the
mystery of why the eight cars are
labled from ‘E’ to ‘L’ rather than ‘A’
to ‘M’.

Jones has no explanation to most
of the questions and just attributes
them to the University decision
makers.

Through his job, Jones obviously
meets all different types of people,
and he said he enjoys just watching
them and the way they act.

At 58, Jones is planning for ‘his
future, hoping to have home repair
keep him busy after his retirement.

But until then, he can be found daily
in front of those elevators, talking
andjoking with people who pass his
way.

But joking aside, Jones takes his
work very seriously. “I come in
here with a strictly business mind to
perform my job," he said. “You’ve
got to stay on your cue at all times,
because it’s a dependable, respon-
sible line of duty. You must keep an
eye on the elevators at all times.”

Jones seldom gets bored doing
what he does, but when he finds
himself slipping away, he whistles.
Or sings. Or he simply walks down
to his dispatch board and keeps
watch. ‘And if nothing comes up,
“Well,” he said, “I always make it
to the end of the day."

“We get complaints about the
matches that people receive——that
their dates have been extreme
opposites," Conley says.

Gripes expressed to the bureau
include remarks that the dating
services “did not consider the

information I gave them in

preparing the ages of my referral,”
that prospective matches lived as
far away from Pittsburgh as New
Orleans and that dates were
dissimilar in interests, education
levels and physical characteristics.

“The services that generate
interest (complaints) are the ones

that cost hundreds of dollars,"
Conley said. A

He added it is difficult to get an
estimate of just how many people
receive unsatisfactory service from
dating ﬁrms because “people are
shy about coming in the first
place.” He says they don’t .want to
admit they were taken in by a dating
service. -

A Musical-Dancing Theatre Z9PP9"'" “V91: And  

BY PAMELA EUSI

The Pittsburgh $.99 Floating

' Theatre opens its 1976-77 season at

8 o’clock tomorrow night with the
premiere of the Entourage Music
and Dance-Theatre Ensemble at the
Chatham College Theatre.

As a group, Entourage has its
base in Millbrook, N.Y., and
consists of four musicians and three
dancers working onstage together
integrating music and dance in
performance. The Ensemble has
been in existence since 1969 and
in 1974.toured nationally for the first

, time.

Speaking with three members of
the company yesterday, I found that
as a whole they stressed the
originality and spontaneity of the
“theatrical product” they present
to audiences all over the country.
All of the material in the
performance is original and collect-
ively composed, from both dance
and music perspectives. '

Combine this originality with the
fact that all of the members of the
group came from different back-
grounds and you get a sense of a
tremendous melting pot of talent
constantly reshaping and revolving
around a necessary basic structure.

There is not one definitive term to
use when describing their art form.
Imagery of all kinds is dealt with in
the performance—1egends, the
occult, archetypes and perhaps the
strongest of all, a sense of dream
state consciousness pervades the

show. The effects on the audience
are strong from the psychological
and emotional viewpoints. A
person's inner level is effected—-
that realm bet/ween the conscious
and subconscious.

The production itself is in two
halves. Most of the material
consists of scenes sequenced
together. Sets and showy costumes

organization called Entourage Inc.,
centered in Millbrook, N.Y., and
focused on dealing with original
works by performing artists. Since
the material in the show is original,
;- ‘me leeway is left for the artist if he
feels that night's solo or movements
need changing.

Two of the dancers in the show,
Laurie Cameron and Ara Fitzgerald

    

performing as actors in a tlgh

choreographed piece, make up the Entourage Music and Dance Theatre
Ensemble from New York. They will begin the $.99 Floating Theatre’s
season Thursday through Sunday at Chatham College. J

Lighting requirements are exten-
sive and demand a skilled
technician who knows the ropes.
David Lear will be handling this

Crazy Quilt Opens
Full-Throttle in Jazz

BY VINCE ROBERTSON

The Crazy Quilt opened three
years ago as a rock, rhythm and
blues club featuring groups such as
the Rhythm Kings, Spirit of ‘76,
Black Love and the Head Liners.

This past June, Crazy Quilt
(located at 24 Market Square,
Downtown,’ initiated jazz on a
part-time basis, "during their
Wednesday and Friday afternoon
cocktail hours. The response was so
enthusiastic, that come next
Monday, the Crazy Quilt will adopt
atotal jazz format. The jazz void left
by the closing of Walt Harper’s
Attic will be ﬁlled.

Crazy Quilt will feature jazz six
nights a week and will add Thursday
to its Wednesday and ‘Friday
cocktail hour format. Performances
will be by local and national talent.

A cover charge of two dollars will ‘

apply Fridays and Saturdays, with
the exception of those weeks that
big name talent will appear; when
the cover charge will apply all week
long at a varied price.

Music and drinks are not the only
fares offered by the Crazy Quilt.
They serve excellent food at a very
reasonable price. The menu, buried
somewhere in the middle of a comic
book, is basically American cuisine
and is varied in choices.

Atmosphere is very mellow with a
broad age group attesting to it

popularity. I , . . a

The decor is a rambling mixture
of antique pieces, gigantic new and
old advertisement posters, unique
art pieces and paintings. The attire
ranges from conservative junior
executive to layed-out boutique.
The end result of this mixture is a
well-balanced, integrated crowd, or
should I say, down-to-earth people.
Not withstanding the few ‘chasers’
who are apt to accompany this sort
of clientele.

So far, November’s schedule is as

Woody's

BY RON NYSWANER

Two ideas run together in

‘Martin Ritt’s The Front that rather

than passing by each other nicely,

collide like the Titanic and the

iceberg to tear the movie apart.
The Front, starring Woody

' Allen, is a pseudo-comedy about

the very unfunny days p of the
McCarthy era and the blacklisting
of communist and communist-
sympathizing artists.

Allen, in what the picture's
promotion call his first dramatic
role, plays a coffee shop cashier
named Howie who becomes a
“front" for blacklisted television
writers,‘putting his name on ‘their
scripts and standing in for them at
production conferences-—all for a

Hot, In Movie Score

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

The Soundtrack From the Film
The Song Remains the Same -
Led Zeppelin

Swan Song - SS 2-201

Well, folks, it’s ﬁnally hap-
pened, the mighty Led Zeppelin
has released The Song Remains
The Same, a two-record set of the
band’s most blazing live material.

The album is the “original
soundtrack of the movie (yet to be
released) of the same name.
nine songs are taken from a 1973
Zeppelin concert performance at
New York Madison Square Garden
and, surpringly, the music is not
dated.

Led Zeppelin tours as frequently
as it snows in Hawaii, and any live
recording of the band’ is a
much-treasurediitem. Judging the
album‘ solely- on the music my
reactions! are mixed. On some
tunes the band plays rock as hard
as it’s humanly possible, but on
others, excessive personal indul-
gence gets the best of them.

Side one opens with a pounding
assault on the eardrums. Most
bands need a few numbers to warm
up an audience, but Zeppelin has a
crowd at its mercy 10 seconds into
their perennial concert opener, the
aptly titled “Rock n’ Roll.”

Drummer John (Bonzo) Bonham

Things go well for Howie. - He
quits the’ coffee shop, moves ‘into a
swank apartment and starts mak-
ing time with the assistant
producer of the show tha‘ he
supposedly writes for.

All this allows for the. kind of
comedy we have come to expect
from Allen. Here, as in all of his
ﬁlms, we see him placed in a
situation that is new to him and
makes him, at first, uncomfortable.
Then, overcoming his bumbling
nervousness, he adjust to his new

environment, surprising even him- i

self with the conﬁdence he has
acquired.

In his last two movies, Sleeper,
and Love and Death, Allen went
forward and then backward in time,

dislocation occurs as a change of
occupation and, consequently, of
social status.

The ﬁlm is funny when it deals
with Howie’s new lifestyle. Allen
is given some opportunity to
deliver such comebacks as-
“Swimming isn’t a sport—it’s what
you do so you don't drown,” or,
“The biggest sin in my family was
buying retai .”

The comic situations are paralled
by a serious undertone in dealing
with various aspects of blacklisting.

This seriousness is embodied in
Hecky, Brown, a television
comedian played by Zero Mostel.
Mostel gives his character a
nervous edge, playing him as a
man who desperately needs to
please—whether it be his au-

dience, or a representative of the —

House ‘UnAmerican Activities
Committee.

The Committee pressures Brown
into spying on Howie, on whom
they have little information but, for

some reason, want some very
badly. '

This relationship between Howie
and Brown brings together the dark
and light elements of the ﬁlm.
Comedy and "drama are balanced
throughout the rest of the movie,
without an important commitment
being made to either. The result is
that the humor is sparce and
seemingly out of place, and the
exploration of blacklisting is
shallow.

Maybe the ﬁlm suffers from

In the ﬁlm, all band members
have a fantasy solo segment
reflecting their personalities.
Page, the baby-faced lead guitarist
has always had his personal life
shrouded in a cloud of evil mystery.

Tales of Satanic worship,

 come across that a major govern-
 ment is supporting, in fact carrying
 out, a program of censorship and
 tyranny against some of its people,

Zeppelin's inception back in ’68.

“Dazed and Confused” lives" up
to these claims and is deﬁnitely not
the signature tune of a man who is
mellowing out eating an ice cream
cone.

Halfway through the driving
heavy metal workout, Page goes off
the deep end into a tortured guitar
solo. Playing the six strings of his
Les Paul with a violin bow, the

ounds that emerge are almost
inhuman. Plants anguished
screams near the end, add chill to

_" this frightening piece of guitar

music.

comes across muddled on the
album. Plant’s voice. cracks, and
the music is not as crisp as the
studio version.

John Bonham is _the ﬁnest
drummer in.fr'ock ’n roll,‘ but his
racing“ solo on’ “Moby Dick”
becomes boring after about three
minutes. A real dilemna, since the
song takes up half of side four.

The ﬁnal song of the soundtrack,
“Whole Lotta Love,” is a classic
heavy metal tune, that pulverized
the eardrums of AM listeners back

in '69, when Zeppelin rose to the
top of the rock world. it, like
“Stairway To Heaven,” comes off
‘much better in the studio rendition.
All in all, this song is a very good
representation of Zeppelin live.
Page’s multi-tracked studio" guitar
parts ' cannot be reproduced on
“Whole Lotta Love” and “Stair-
way To Heaven,” and these songs
hold the album back from classic
status. “Moby Dick” should have
been either eliminated or cut down
to a reasonable length, providing
room for other Zeppelin tracks.
But these few kinks aside, Zeppelin
remains the deﬁnitive hard rock
band.

Panther tailback Tony Dorsett in one of the many runs which
contributed to his designation as the greatest running back of all time in
college football and the major college career rushing leader.

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

You have to admire Tony Dorsett.
Not just because he is perhaps the
greatest running back ever to play
college football, but also because of
_ the way he takes people praising
_ him left and right, the bright lights
needed for television blinding him,
and pushy reporters hounding him
for interviews, and meeting’ the
President, and...Well, you have to
admire him by not being bothered’
by all this fame and glory.
,Maybe Dorsett is used to it. By
_ now he should be. And it was no
different at Dorsett’s guest appear-
, '1 ance at the weekly media luncheon
Tuesday, following his record-
. breaking performance last Saturday
versus Navy, when he surpassed
Archie Grifﬁn’s major collegle
career rushing mark.
‘ lt’_s a little more than normal,”
- .Dorsett said of his life, hectic
already from his contention in the
race for the coveted Heisman
.Trophy. “I’ve been getting a lot of
requests for interviews and for

appearances, but there isn't time to

Wilson photo
do all of them because of schoolwork
and practice.”

Besides his meeting with Presi-
dent Ford Tuesday morning at the
Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport, Dorsett also has been
requested to ride an elephant next-
Wednesday in the ‘Barnum and
Bailey Circus at the Civic Arena.

Actually, Dorsett has been

help but have in the back ofhis mind
another record within his reach-
that of Howard Stevens, who set the
collegiate rushing record of 5,297

Louisville and Randolph-Macon.

“I want to push that record up so
high that no running back will even
think about breaking it,” Dorsett
said in an Ali-like manner. “But if
one ever does, I’d like to be around
to congratulate him.”

Q

Blockers Contribute In D

BY STEVE SYBERT

The Pitt football team and Tony
Dorsett have this thing going. They
love each other.

And it will never be more evident
than it was after Dorsett made
history at Navy last weekend.

Immediately after Dorsett ripped
off his dazzling record-breaking
32-yard touchdown run, the entire
Pitt bench, trainers, managers,
cheerleaders and spectators mob-
bed him in the end zone and almost
crushed him in showing their
affection.

Part of the reason is Dorsett
himself, who has always gone out of
his way to give credit to his
teammates. Like he did after the
game. “I love you guys," Dorsett
told the team in the locker room.
“You all pulled together with me to
achieve this goal. The offense
blocked for me and the defense has
gotten the ball for us all year. I want
to thank you all for helping me with
all my records.”

“The offense blocked.”i And
when he said that, Dorsett was
primarily referring to the offensive
line. '

Dorsett is fortunate to be playing
with teammates who actually enjoy
blocking for him, an offensive line
which takes a great deal of
satisfaction in every yard he gains,
running partners who don’t mind
doing more blocking than they do
running, and receivers who have
done a diligent job of downﬁeld

gblocking.

BY STEVE SYBERT

Bucknell, Fordham, Cornell and
Syracuse are not exactly your
common football powerhouses right
now, but they are four of the better
teams in the East, in water polo that
is, and four teams that the Panthers
dominated last weekend ‘at the
Bucknell Invitational_ Tournament.

The Pitt water polo team, grown
from a club to an “unofficia ”

varsity sport in only three years, has . I

now earned the top spot in the East,
with the possible ‘exception of the
Ivy League's power, .Brown, by

Dorsett's accomplishments.

“Our offensive line has just been
very good the last two years,” said a
delighted coach Johnny Majors.
“We have experience, we have
cohesion, we have good leadership
in the line and they take a lot of
pride in helping to win the football
game for us. And I think they
certainly take a lot of pride in
blocking for Tony Dorsett and the
rest of our ﬁne backﬁeld of Elliott
Walker and Bobby Hutton.”

This year’_s offensive line consid-
ers itself very lucky to have had the
opportunity to help Dorsett surpass
the premier record for an individual

in college football. And as’ the
yards ticked away, the linemen
began to feel the tension and with
every announcement of Dorsett’s
total wanted and even more to get
him the record.

“You could see a change coming
over everybody in the huddle,” said
Stone. “Whenever we heard the
announcer announce the yardage
needed, everybody just started
talking about it and we decided we
were going to go out and do it.”

“We really wanted to go out and
get the record for him,” agreed

Hanhauser. “We were aware of it
the whole ballgame.”

Many of Tony Dorsett’s long gainers started with small holes

   

  

at the

line of scrimmage opened by linemen such as tight end Jim Corbett [81]
and tackles George Messich [76] and John I-Ianhauser [64].

Hutton Overshadowed In

Star-Studded Pitt Backfield B

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

Okay, we all know what a
fantastic running back the Pitt
football team’ has in the record-
shattering Tony Dorsett. And most
experts also list fullback Elliott
Walker as an excellent player. Of
course, there is the claim that
Dorsett’s exploits overshadow
Walker's efforts, so consider, if you
will, the case of senior fullback
Bobby Hutton who plays in the
shadow of both.

Not only has Hutton been able to
ﬁllin for both Dorsett and Walker
successfully, but he also is a ﬁne
player in his own right. Voted the
Ed Conway Memorial Award as the
most improved player in spring
practice, Hutton got a chance to
demonstrate his progress in the
annual Blue-Gold spring game by
gaining 56 yards on 21 carries.

During last year's Pitt-Army
game, while his reknowned team-
mates were at their best, Hutton put
forth one of his most proliﬁc efforts

    

BOBBY HUTTON
and ran for 88 yards on 12 carries in
the 52-20 Panther romp.

Last season, Hutton was Pitt’s
fourth leading rusher averaging 4.8
yards per carry (215 yards on 45
carries). Thus far in the 1976
season, he has rushed for * a
disappointing 64 yards on 26

' _attempts (for. a 2.5 average), but his

key blocks have made him I a
valuable performer.

~ Hutton came to Pitt in 1973, the
same year that brought) the Major
change to the football team,

- “mostly because of the academ-

ics,”» he said. Back at Mahwah-
(N.J.) High School, Hutton earned
three letters, was named All-
League, All-Suburban and All-
County. . .

Naturally, Pitt’s football schedule
held a lot of attraction for the 5-10
Hutton; while the team itself was

‘coming offa dismal campaign, the
opposition included- collegiate
powers like Notre ' Dame and
Southern California—“the teams
you hear about when you’re a kid.”

“We’ve improved over the
course of four years. It makes it

everybody’s been together for a
long time. ‘

“We're all going for the big
goal-——a national championship,”
Hutton stressed.

Hutton, who threw the ﬁnal block I

for Dorsett’s record breaking
touchdown run, féels that the
national attention focused on the
team, and Dorsett in particular,
adds incentive.

‘ ‘I think it’s good as far as. being a
player. It's a good feeling—makes
you feel like now you’re really on
top," he said. “It’s nice to know
we're one of the top teams. It gives

recognition not only to the team but ‘ '

to the whole University.”

As to the question of team
jealousy, Hutton was emphatic in
pointing out that Pitt’s success is
due to a full team effort.

“Everybody has a job to do. He
(Dorsett) can’t do what he wants
unless we cooperate and vice versa.

“As far as my expectations for
the season,” Hutton went on, “I
think everything is going pretty
good. Hawk (Dorsett) and Elliott
are playing good.”

Recently, Pitt students have been

criticized by various sources (most _

notably Majors) for lack of support.
Hutton, however, feels that far:

Pitt Open For Business

BY JIM GEFSKY

For the Pantherette netters the
like the
expression “business as usual.”

They traveled on Friday to face
Towson State and met Maryland on
Saturday. At Baltimore, they were
expected to defeat Towson State,
which they did S-4, and, at College
Park, they were expected to bow to
Maryland, again which they did,
6-3.

Against Towson State, the
netters showed an awesome singles
display. Maria Paris downed
Sandy Richardson, 6-1, 6-2, and
Janet DeCostro outlasted Celie
Johns, 6-3, 6-4. Janice Irwin
returned from her injury and, with

Demko, 7-5, 6-2. Dane Frey and’
Pam Bachman defeated Donna
Zaydon, and Cheryl Johnson
respectively, both by scores of 6-2,
6-1.

Nancy Ballistreri was the only
disappointment as she was edged
in straight sets. The netters also
won three exhibition singles
matches.

Since the singles players won
five games, the netters had
clinched the victory. This allowed
coach Nancy Gordon totest some
new_doubles teams. The teams of
Irwin-Ballistreri, Bachman-Ann
Seebold, and Jan Brownstein-Terry
Lies all lost very close matches.

But at College Park, both the
quality of tennis and the results
changed noticeably.

nated Suzanne Green, 7-5, 6-4, and
DeCostro, who is undefeated in

Ballistreri lost in close straight
sets. But the quintessence of Pitt's
loss was the play of the remaining
singles players. Irwin, Frey and
Bachman could muster only nine
games between them.

In doubles Paris-DeCostro de-
feated Green-Greenﬁeld, 6-2, 6-7,
6-4. Pitt had match point in the
second set but could not reach

Cubs crunched, 44-0

BY JIM MILLER

Things weren’t as bright in
College Park this past weekend for
the Panther junior varsity football
team as they were for Pitt’s varsity
in Annapolis- A strong Maryland
Terrapin squad held the JV’s
scoreless while rolling to a 44-0
victory, collecting 32 second-

‘ quarter points.

A total of 316 yards in penalties
and numerous turnovers marred the
effectiveness of both teams—espec-
ially Pitt, which was kept in poor
field position most of the afternoon.

The Cubs also were hampered by
having to convert three defensive
starters to offensive positions and
moving a guard over to center, thus
creating a makeshift offensive line

The thin defense did a very good
job of containing the Terps, 
however, pinning them inside their
50-yard line for the entire first
quarter.

But then the second-quarter
surge came, as Maryland broke
loose for a 32-0 halftime lead. V

The only consolation for Pitt was
that the Panthers allowed the tough
Terps only 12 points the rest of the
way. Coach Bob Matey praised his,-7‘-»
squad for “not quitting against a
very strong Maryland team” when
the odds were stacked against

NIXON TAPES MAY BE AIRED:

WASHINGTON ‘ (AP)—The

U.S. Court of Appeals cleared the _

way Tuesday for broadcasting of the
Nixon White House tapes played at
the Watergate cover-up trial.’ '

“The! tapes played at trial are no
longer confidential,” the ' court
ruled in a 2-1 decision.

The ruling also permits the sale of
the tapes as phonograph records.

Included is the so-called “smokin
gun" tape of June 23, 1972, when

former President Richard M. Nixon -

ordered that the FBI’s investigation
of the Watergate break-in, six days
earlier, be halted.

Also among the tapes played. at
the trial is the March 21, 1973

warning, by former Nixon counsel »

John Dean, thatthere was a cancer
on the presidency.

The three television networks,
the Public Broadcasting System, a

news directors’ organization and I ’

Warner Communications, Inc., ‘a

manufacturer of phonograph rec- '

ords, had asked to reproduce the.
tapes. 4

NUCLEAR WORKERS
RISK CANCER

WASHINGTON (AP)—A study

suggesting increased risk of cancer 9

death to nuclear industry workers
appears to conﬂict with 30 years of
previous studies and will have to be

carefuly evaluated, the Nuclear.

Regulatory Commission said Tues‘-_
day.

Roger Mattson, director of health
and safety standardsfor the NRC,
said the federally ﬁnanced study by
Dr.

ions than previous work Mancuso

has done using virtually the same , 7 '

data. ’ .

Using the death certificates of
3,883 atomic workers who have died
between 1944 and 1972, the study
group concluded that occupational.
radiation exposure below present
government standards resulted in
increased cancer deaths.

The study was compiled by
Mancuso, of the University of
Pittsburgh, Dr. Alice Stewart. a
British physician and epidemeolog-9

. ist, and George Kneale, a research

statistician. They were not,

availalbe for comment. , '
The examination of death certiﬁ-

cates showed that 473 of the 3,883

workers exposed to radiation well ‘

below present standards died of
cancer. The study concluded that 6
per cent of these cancer cases would
not have occurred if workers had

' avoided radiation.
