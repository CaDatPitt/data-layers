‘WBenefits

Great’ Says
Thompson

Dr. Douglass S. Thompson,
director of the Student Health
Service, announced Monday
that next trimester a new
Student Health Fee goes into
effect.

This compulsory fee will cost
full-time resident students ten
dollars and commuters ﬁve dol-
lars a trimester. ~

This is a very modest fee when
one considers the great value of
the beneﬁts to be enjoyed through
the facilities of the Health Serv-
ice,” stated Dr. Thompson.

“The University has been in-
terested in making the Health
Service something that it has
not been in the past. When our
rebuilding is complete, we will
have available here superior
care in surgery, internal medi-
cine, dermatology. orthopedics,
psychiatry, gynecology, and
hopefully, if arrangements work
out, dentistry.”

Thompson feels that students
should realize that the Health
Service is not a right, but a priv-
ilege, therefore, it is only fair that
the students should contribute to
the support of this institution.

This health fee. Thompson cau-
tioned, is not to be confused with
the $20 insurance policy for which
all resident students are required
to register at the beginning of the
year. Instead, this is an entirely
new fee designed to enable the
Service to carry on its activities
for the beneﬁt of the students at
an accelerated rate.

 

Winter Trimester
Registration Kits
Available Monday

Registration kits for the Winter
trimester will be available Mon-
day, Tuesday and Wednesday.
Students may pick their kits up
at the oﬁice of the dean of their
school.

Engineering and Mines students
excluding mechanical engineering
students, may obtain their kits
from 508 Engineering Hall Mon-
day, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday from 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.

Kits for the mechanical engin-
eers will be available on the same
date from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in 201
Engineering Hall.

All students, with the exception
of new or readmitted students,
initiating registration on January
2 will be charged a late registra-
tion fee.

Quadrangle Christmas

‘WITHOUT A DOUBT, Christmas has once again come to Schenley
Quadrangle and some of our over-anxious coeds couldn’t wait
till the 25th to grab the presents that Santa has left for them un-
der McCormick Hall”s gaily decorated tree.

Increase
Follows

U. 5. Trend

The University is far from
the only institution which has
announced a tuition increase
for September 1962. At least
one area college and three

ilar increases.

Duquesne University will in-
crease its fees from $25 to $26 a
credit next fall. Reasons for their
raise are substantially the same
as those of the University —- to
keep abreast of rising faculty
salaries. ‘

Other major colleges and Uni-
versities in the area have not yet
announced any increases. Carnegie
Tech presently charges $600 a
term for undergraduate programs
and $11 a unit (with approxi-
mately three units equalling one
credit) for graduate and part—time
students.

Chatham College also charges

a $600 rate for a term of full-

time study but special study

(six hours or less) costs $40 a

credit.

Elsewhere in the nation, Colum-

broadcast.

Father John Greene as Deacon and
Father H. A. Reinhold as Sub-
deacon. A special schola com-
prised of students from Carnegie
Tech and the University will chant
the Proper of the Mass in Gregor-
ian Chant.

rect a special Polifontic choir in
Christmas carols and motets.

In order to insure adequate
seating for students and faculty
members wishing to attend the
Mass, free tickets for faculty
and personnel may be obtained
by contacting Frank Callanen in
Dr. Alan Rankin’s office, 156 CL.
or calling him over extension
238.

Students may obtain tickets at
the Cathedral Student Desk or
through any officer of the New-
man Club. Nurse tickets are avail-
able at the lobby desk of the
Nurses Residence.

This is the ﬁrst time a Christ-
mas Mass has been broadcast from
a college campus, according to
Dave Urbaitus, Newman Club
publicity director.

NBC To Air Christmas

Eve Religious Service

Solemn High Mass, scheduled for Heinz Memorial Chapel
on Christmas Eve, will be broadcast nationwide by the
National Broadcasting Company over nearly ‘200 affiliated
stations. WJAS in Pittsburgh will originate the far-reaching

Father Phillip Walsh of the Pittsburgh Oratory will
celebrate the Mass, along with¢

Father John Ryan will also di-

bia has raised its fee from $1,450
to $1,575 for two terms of full-
time study. For September of
1963, Columbia plans another in-
crease to $1,700.

Columbia, like the University
and Duquesne, has also stated that
the raise is necessary to hold top
faculty members, not, as with
their previous increase, to raise
faculty salaries.

The University of Chicago and
Brown University have also an-
nounced tuition hikes for the com-
ing fall.

The Antiqua Players will present the medieval
miracle play, “The Son of Getron," at 3 p.m. Satur- 
day and 2 p.m. Sunday in Heinz Chapel.

The Christmas program first appeared in Euro— y
pean churches in 1275. It is the story of a child
who is kidnapped by a pagan king and saved by
the prayers of his mother and the intercession of
St. Nicholas.

The musical group has striven to preserve the
tone of the story by use of: the original Latin lyrics
and medieval musical instruments.

Colin C. Sterne, associate professor of music,
spent the entire summer transcribing the music in-
to a modern form. The middle ages’ instruments
which will be used are viola da gamba, psaltery,
cromorne, recorder, drums, cymbals, tamborines,
bells, gongs, and chimes.

Thomas Wheel will accompany the Latin verse
with a narration in English. In addition, eight
members of the Heinz Chapel Choir will participate
in the drama. .

The entire production is being staged by Ber-
nard B. Engel, director of the Pitt Players and in-
structor in the Speech Department.

The Antiqua Players presented another musical
allegory last year. “The Miracle of St. Nicholas."

others have announced sim-

NGREASE,

Course Fees

Hiked $5
Per Credit

University students will see
their sixth tuition raise in
eleven years next fall when
credit fees increase from $28
to $33.

The credit raise, coupled
with a two dollar per credit activ-
ity fee increase, will cost a full-
time student from Pennsylvania
$104 more per trimester, begin-
ning in September 1962. Out-of-
state students will pay $120 more.
These averages are based on an
average liberal arts student credit
load of 151/2.

Students in other areas of the
University may find minor modiﬁ-
cations from these ﬁgures in their
own curriculum costs.

Institution Costs Rise

In a letter mailed to parents
shortly after the University Sen-
ate confirmed the raise lvlonday

Chancellor Litchﬁeld said thaf
“Although the increase will by In
means balance the University

budget, it will go a long way to-
ward preserving at Pitt the qual
ity of education we now provide.’

Reason given by the Chancello.
for the increase is to meet risin_.
instructional costs, particularl;
faculty salaries, library mainten

ance costs and laboratory ex
penses.
The Chancellor emphasized

that even with the tuition raise
the University does not expect
to make ends meet. Only about
two thirds of the $13 million in-
structional costs for this year
were paid by tuition revenue.
Public and private contribu-
tions made up the deﬁcit and

The Compulsory Privilege

No one’s happy when prices go up, but at least most
people have the right to choose whether they will pay that
price or not, regardless what it’s for. Not so with the Uni-
versity’s Health Service.

Whether he wants to use the service or not, a resident
student must pay ten dollars a year and a commuting stu-
dent five dollars a year to support the institution.

In explaining the recent compulsory health fee, Dr.
Douglass S. Thompson, director of the Student Health Serv-
ice, pointed out that such a service is not a right but a
privilege, therefore every student should contribute to its
support. Going to college is also a privilege, but no where
does it say that a student must pay for an education if he
chooses not to attend an institution.

It is not only strange but unfair, then, that a student
should be required to pay for a privilege he does not wish
to use. Whether he needs it or-not is another question.

The fact that when Blue Cross raises its rates it makes
banner headlines, indicates the popularity, of comprehensive

health plans. Student protection from family health pro-
grams, then, makes Pitt’s plan superfluous  many in-
stances. If a student wants the additional protection, there
is no reason why he shouldn’tbe able to pay the extra fee.
But for those students who feel they are ‘sufficiently covered,
it does not follow that he must support an institution that
he is not going to use.

The problem centers on the type of treatment the
Health Service intends to give. If the center were to remain
a chieﬂy ‘diagnostic service, then the fee would be un-
reasonable because an extensive building of facilities would
be unnecessary. But the plan. is to develop superior care
in surgery, internal medicine, dermatology, orthopedics,
etc., not just the diagnosis of it. A ﬁve or ten dollar health

fee then seems highly insufficient even to maintain the

facilities, for it must surely develop into a miniatur

hospital. ’
Before students are forced‘ to contribute anything, a

more thorough explanation of the situation should be given.

Tuition Troubles. . .

  The Wicleningi Cyre

 

By Jim Hufnagel

Next fall Pitt goes» ivy league -— ivy league in
price, that is. Whether she will provide ivy league
educations remains to be proven, and proven rap-
idly if she wishes to attract the best from an ever-
diminishing number of families who can afford
university education.

But Pitt is only a painful local example of a
problem which faces all Amer-
ican universities. Ours is far
from the only institution that
must raise its fees in ‘62 -- Co-
lumbia, Chicago, Duquesne and
Brown have already announced
drastic increases; Penn State’s
went up this year; more will un- '
doubtedly follow.

The national situation is not
cited to extentuate ‘Pitt’s.move
(this is the" far from coveted
task of our administrators), but
to point out a crisis which seriouslyléhallenges the
entire American notion of education.

We are firmly committed to a belief that we
must provide equality of opportunity -- opportu-
nity for everyone to. advance himself according to
his own abilities and for his own ends. But we
are in most deadly competition with a society that
believes differently, a society that believes that the
individual exists not for his own ends but for the
ends of the state.

Soviet Russia has emphatically dedicated her
educational system to the training of an intellec-
tual elite. She is sparing little expense, economic
or moral, to do so. Russian training in technology,
languages and political tactics is, we are discover-
ing daily, second to none.

Falling Behind

American universities are aware that they are
falling behind, yet they are also aware that they
must increase tuition fees just to make ends meet.
The increase effective here next fall is not, primar-
ily, meant to intensify quality, but to cancel a $314:
million deficit between tuition revenue and faculty
salaries. We will pay $5 more per credit just to
keep the cathedrals doors open.

»The effect the raise will have on the size of
Pitt's student body is a disturbing speculation. Just
as frightening are the implications it will have

Foreign Forun No. 

 

upon the character of enrollment. Pitt must either
become “a rich man's school" or price itself out of
business. '

Yes, certainly scholarship and university em-
ployment opportunities will be broadened. But you
can only steal so much from Peter. Loans also will
undoubtedly become more plentiful. But the local
area is far from a lucrative one for post graduate
job prospects, and few students will want to go
heavily in debt.

The problem is an urgent one. American higher
education everywhere, instead of training more
people better, will soon be training fewer at the
same level. We will be producing, not an intellec-
tual elite, but an educational aristocracy.

Yeats’s Phrase

The situation, in Yeats’s phrase, is “Turning and
turning in the widening gyre.” Unless we can
tighten that gyre, and tighten it fast, we will be
devoured by the “rough beast.”

Solution to the problem? It notably has no one
solution. ' ‘

Tax laws designed so that corporations would
proﬁt even more by contributing to universities
rather than to federal coffers might alleviate some
diﬁiculties. But the federal government can natur-
ally tolerate only a certain degree of this.

Direct federal aid to higher education is another
possibility. This plan also has some rather out-
spoken opponents.

Increased state aid? New York has managed to
circumvent objections to private school aid by di-
rectly subsidizing the student. Time will judge the
merits of this policy.

But perhaps the biggest roadblock is psychologi-
cal. Except for university administrators and a
handful of editorial snipers around tuition-raising
time, few Americans seem to consider that atomic
age higher education is no longer a laisscz—l'-aire
area.

The solutions so far advanced may very well
not be advisable, or even adequate, but even these
are not being weighed seriously, and alternatives
are slow in coming.

Unless America gets this capitalist machine in 1

gear, she will lose the race —- the Russians are al-

ready‘ half-way through the light, and they have ‘

their accelerator on the floor.

The New Netherlands

By Joke Tamlniau

What would have happened if New York were
still New Amsterdam? If New York remained as a
symbol of the Dutch contribution to American his-

tory? Would the inhabitants of both nations feel

the stringent urge to see each other in the standard
stereotypes as they do now? Stereotypes which
seems to express continuously the many differences
between the countries make the
frontiers seem like angold Ro-
man city wall,» frequently forti-
ﬁed and heightened by many
lectures and travelogues.

The name France signiﬁes
Paris; and England, probably
Oxford manners and fog; Aus-
tria equates with leather sus-
penders; and, of course, the very
name Holland evokes dreams of
wooden shoes and windmills.
Stereotypes of this kindmay be ,
valuable ‘for tourism and can at times be -helpful
in international trade and advertising. Iniour ideals
for mutual understanding and acceptance, however,
they often prove to be a hindrance. _ _

For a long time, Dutch people ‘settled along the
East coast of the United States and left their names
as a memory of the days when the Netherlands and
America were closely connected. But all that is
known about Holland today seems sometimes as
little as you can fit into a wooden shoe.

Really The Netherlands _

The real name of the country is The Nether-
lands, which means low lands. And the land is
really low, at some places more than 13 feet below
sea level. Once there was nothing but a marshy
region separated from the North Sea by a chain of
sand dunes. The few inhabitants lived on ‘mounds
near the sea or in the hilly eastern part of the
country. The Netherlands were in constant danger
of being flooded and ruined by the tides, but dikes
were constructed and land was drained and made
productive. The Dutch learned how to conquer the
sea and to keep courage high despite its many at-
tacks. The motto “je maintiendrai” in the national
Coat of Arms has become signiﬁcant for our peo-
ple.

Land was needed so the lakes were drained.
After the first results of this drainage showed suc-

 

cess, a new project was undertaken. It was an au-
dacious plan which began with the building of the
dike through the former Zuider Zee. This dike
connected two parts of Holland, took away the
tremendous force of the ocean waves, and short-
ened the dike surface in the area from 108 miles to
only 27 miles. The former sea was enclosed and a
new lake was formed, the Ijselmeer. And the pro-
cess of drainage began anew. Upon completion of
the present projects, an additional 350,000 acres or
new valuable agricultural land will be obtained
from where formerly the fishermen beat their
boats against the stormy northwest winds. The
“Delta Plan” will ﬁnally result in a complete seal-
ing off of the several miles of the "sea, enclosing
in all the islands, a gigantic project demanding’ the
most modern engineering skills. “A country that
lives has to build on itsfuture,” and the more than

10 million inhabitants in. a country the size ofthe‘

state of South Carolina have to build a future, have
to ﬁnd new living space.

Enemy and Friend ..

Sea and land —-‘such a paradoxical relationship M

between the two as in the Netherlands does not
seem possible. The sea, our strongest enemy, is also
our best -friend. Seaports and commercial cities,
like Rotterdam and Amsterdam, owe the sea their
existence, and both now play an important role in
world trade and shipping. Rotterdam grew to be
the second largest harbor in the world after New
York. The docks, warehouses and loading facilities
are modern and efficient. The Rhine River traffic
connecting Rotterdam with West Germany is

known as the backbone of western European

transportation.

The constant struggle with, but also the need
for water around us, is just another aspect of the
country where the tulip bulbs flower in superb

colors during the spring, where the blossoms of the

fruit trees form a happy contrast with the growing
industries and the colors of the old ﬁshermen’s cos-
tumes blend with the products of high fashion and

style, where the population tries to keep up a deﬁ- ‘
nite individualism despite the lack of space. The:

stereotypes may be found, but the Netherlands re-
mains a growing and dynamic country and can,n_o
longer be visualized solely through the‘.eyes of a
child’s travel book.

 

  

Merry   C 

Christxnas is here. You can see it in the strings of lights

tw'ink'.ling their Christmas message above Forbes and Fifth
Avenues. You can see it in the gaily decorated trees which
grace the nationality rooms, and soon you will be able to
see it in the towering trees lighting the Commons Room.
Yes, Christmas is here, at least ostensibly.

Although the following is not a Christmas poem, we

feel it expresses the true spirit of the coming season:

I asked God for strength that I might achieve,
I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey.

I asked for help that I might do g‘reate.r things,
I was given inﬁrmity that I might do better things,

I asked for riches that I might be happy,
I was given poverty that I might be ‘wise.

I asked for all things that I might enjoy "life,
.I was given life that I might enjoy all things,.

I was giveri nothing_: that I had asked for,
But everything that I had hoped for.

Despite myself, my prayers were answerecl,
I am among‘ all men most richly blessedt

Senate Reorganization

Committee Dissolves

Theimembers of the Student
Government reorganization com-
mittee‘ disolved the committee at
their last meeting, it was reported
to the Student Senate Monday.

The motion for dissolution was
made because the members of the
cornmittee-felt that there was too
much conflict among the commit-
tee members on the issues at
hand, and that they could not
come up with a reorganization

« plan that would suit the best in-

terests of the Senate. .b
The resignation of the commit-

ll tee was accepted and the Senate

requested the chairman to prepare

a report on the work the commit-
tee had completed before dissolu-
tion and that it be presented at
the ﬁrst Senate meeting in Jan-
uary. It was decided that anyone
wishing to submit a plan for the
reorganization of SG could sub-
mit it to the Senate during this
meeting.

Dr. Douglas Thompson spoke to
the Senate concerning the new

health service fee of ﬁve dollars"

for commuting students and ten
dollars for dorm students. He dis-
cussed the facilities which the
Health Service will offer starting
next trimester and of the facilities
proposed for the future.

Holiday Decorations
Adorn Classrooms

By MATT SWETONIC
The Cathedral is once again ready to burst out with
Christmas spirit as the Holiday decorations begin to take
their places within the Commons Room.
The Nationality Rooms have been prepared for the
Christmas season since last Saturday when members of the

individual Nationality Room C
student hostesses artfully decorat-6
ed the rooms with traditional
C h r i s t m a s ornaments brought
from the countries which the
rooms represent.

In the Lithuanian classroom, for
example, the oranments have all
been made out of drinking straws
in the shape of stars and crosses.

Food Decorations

In the Russian, Polish, German,
and Czechoslovakian rooms, just
to name a few, the trees have been
decorated with food.

Apples, cookies, and other edi-
ble ornaments take the place of
our American decorative balls and
tinsel, for it is common practice
among foreign countries to orna-
ment their trees with homemade
decorations.

In the German room is a spe-
cial reminder of the religious
aspect of Christmas. To one side
of the Christmas tree stands an

Advent candle with the 24 days

of December marked off so that

when the candle ﬁnally burns
down, it will be Christmas Day.

By Thursday or Friday of this
week the rest of the Commons
Room will also come out in bril-
liant shades of green and red.

This year’s decorations will con-
sist of 10 medium sized trees scat-
tered throughout the Commons
Room and one large one placed
directly in the center.

Colored Lights Planned

The trees are at present being
ﬁre-proofed but as soon as this is

WHEN DOES A LUCKY TASTE BETTER THAN A LUCKY? There's a dangerous
question because, as you well know, college students are crazy about Luckies
and smoke more of them than any other regular. Still, there is one kind of
Lucky that tastes a‘ little bit better than any other kind. These extra-special
Luckies are the ones you get for Christmas. The only thing better than a Lucky
is a free Lucky. Ask for a carton this Christmas.

  "It Goes On..."

HOUR OF DECISION

Looking over a mass of Purdue basketball fans at their
school’s ﬁeld house —— over 9,000 in number -—- a_ scout for
Evansville University turned to me, and said, “We have a
spanking new ﬁeld house in our town. It seats 14,000 and we
don’t have a darn bit of trouble ﬁllin’ it. '

“How big is your place?” he inquired.

“About half this big,” I replied.

“I guess you don’t have any trouble ﬁllin’ your place with
a team like yours,” he said, naively.

“Did you ever hear of the Biblical tale about the
rich man who went out into the side streets and along the
highways to get people to sit at his immense dinner
table?” I said, using an allusion to shatter an illusion.

He was either dumbfounded, ignorant of the New Testa-

*“”“'ment, or busy, but he didn't answer me.

Illusions of Crowds

The gent would probably be just as tongue—tied. if he
counted all the empty seats which prevail at a Pitt basketball
game. The 1961 edition of Panther cagers has probably been
spoiled early by having 16,000 people witness their play, but
any illusions of grandeur crumbled when 617 hardy souls
trudged through the snow to see them against Tech’s intra-
mural calibre ﬁve.

“It’s tough to play ball before a crowd like that,”
Brian Generalovich, the brute under the boards for Pitt,
said. “But this team is never going to quit hustling this
year. We’re tired of hearing how poor Pitt basketball
teams are, and we’re out to prove ourselves.”

I took a vow of silence’ on the subject of school spirit.

“earlier in the year, but basketball is too great a game to

be played before the immediate family members only. Pick
up any sports magazine and you’ll find panorama shots of
college kids going wild over the roundball sport, cheerleaders
whirling about, banners flying high, and action at a zenith.

The University dorms are ﬁlling up, and the number of
campus students is increasing. Attendance should rise with
the growth of resident students. Just because you were
turned down by an Ivy League school and your heart still
lies within the ‘halls,’ don’t scorn Pitt as an illegitimate child.

She’s yours.

=l= *

Calvin Sheﬁield,.who carries a Bible with him on every
trip, was sitting in the Student Union before the Ohio State
game, meditating about the oncoming clash _with the Buck-
eyes. The wide-eyed sophomore said, “Boy this seems so odd.
Ever since I’ve held a ball I’ve read so much about Jerry
Lucas. And now I’m going to be playing against him tonight.”

Sheffield shook his head, andpput his arms akimbo.
“It's like playing against some god,” he exclaimed. “That
(Terry) iDischinger was just another eat, but this man
is really saying something.”

*

=l=

The Lucas about whom Sheffield was speaking, has his
own troubles about upcoming opponents, somewhat different
from ‘Cal’s worries. When accused of playing a mechanical
ball. game against Pitt, Lucas answered his critic: “I try to
regard every team with the same frame of mind. I try my
best against every team. ~

“If you don’t respect your opponent you can get in
trouble,” Lucas remarked. “I try not to be mechanical, but
sometimes it’s hard to get worked up over ‘a lowly—regarded
club.” Tha[t’~s what happens when you’re too deadly at

PITTPOURI —- Ohio State beat Wichita and Wake For-
est, which was ranked No. 3 in the country, worse than they
whipped Pitt. Purdue smashed highly regarded Detroit also
with more decisiveness than they did Pitt . . . Tom Hamilton,
commissioner of the Big Five Conference, says of Pitt’s
wrestling coach: “Rex Peery is the best coach that I’ve ever
come across in any sport.”

The basketball fans in the
Pittsburgh area are in for a
real treat thisweekend when

gets underway. As usual Pitt
and Duquesne are participat-
ing, along with
a fine Duke
squad and a
mediocre Ari-
zona quintet.

The Panthers
and the boys
from the Bluff
have met seven
times in the
ﬁnal with the
Dukes winning
four of the en-
counters. In the
last six years they have split. The
only outside team to ever win the
Tournament was George Wash-
ington in 1954, and that because
(so it is said) Si Green of Du-
quesne was out with appendicitis.

For the first time in the tourney
there will be a most valuable
player award. Some basketball ex-
perts say that it should be a toss-
up between Dukes’ All—American,
Junior Art Heyman, and Sopho-
more Willie Somerset of Du-
quesne.

- Blue Devils Ranked

Heyman, who learned his bask-
etball at the same place the Pan-
thers’ Ben Jinks learned his,
Rockville Center, Long Island, is
being counted upon to lead the
Blue Devils to an Atlantic Coast
Conference title and national re-
cognition.

Cubs Improve Quickly l

By LEN BERENFIELD
The 1961 edition of Pitt’s freshman basketball team is
currently sporting an undefeated season. After defeating
-Johnstown College in the season opener, the Panther Cubs
ran their string of victories to two with their win over
Carnegie Tech last Saturday.
(The Frosh met Duquesne lastﬁ
night at the Field House, but due
to the publication deadline the
results of the game could not be
reported.) ‘
Speaking of Pitt’s showing
, against Carnegie Tech, Coach Carl
Peterson had this to say: “The
team improved its performance
over the Johnstown game. The
boys didn’t make as many mis-
takes against Tech and took ad-
vantage of the opportunities which

shots,” says Peterson, “while
Holder also has a good shot and
keeps the team on its toes with
his aggressive play.”

In contrast to their first -game,
the Cubs ﬁnished strong against
Tech. Although they only led 34-
32 at halftime, they opened up a
big lead in the second half.

Hoopsters Count On Redhead For Support;

Sophomore Surprised At Starting Position

Krieger Improves
With. Other Sophs

By ART FLEISCHER
In colleges where the em-
phasis is on “the big man,” a
boy 6-ft., 6-in. doesn’t usually
stand out on a basketball
court. When he weighs 190

pounds, however, and has

bright red hair, one tannot help
but take a second look at him.
Thus Paul Krieger ﬁnds himself
in the public eye.

When asked how he felt about

I0 his role of starting for the varsity

while he was only a sophomore,
Paul replied, “I am a little sur-
prised. I never thought I would
come this far.” This far is a long«
er distance than most boys travel,
for Paul only played one year of
high school ball.

At Uniontown, where Paul play-
ed under Coach Abe Everhart, he
was the sixth and eleventh man on
Everhart’s three platoon system.
“It was pretty reckless in high
school,” said the redhead, “We
used a West Virginia style of
play.”

All-State Musician

L The fact that'Paul was an All‘-
State tuba player for two years
is well-known to the folks back
at Uniontown. “That’s in the past
now," stated Paul seriously, “All
I want to concentrate on is bas-
ketbaill—-not music.”

The improvement in “Red” is
not only due to the coaching of
Carl Peterson and Bob Timmons
but also to Paul’s daily devotion
to basketball during the past
summer while he was working
at Atlantic City. ' ‘

“I played for Rocky Casallanis’

     

PanllIer's Paul Krieger
It * *
Bar and Grill in an Ocean City
League,” said Krieger, breaking
into an always—ready smile. “We
ﬁnished second in an eight team
league.” When he wasn’t playing
one of the three games a week
or working at a hot dog stand on
the Boardwalk, he was on the
court playing a pick-up game or
practicing.

First Game Jitters

It is sort of ironical that in his
first two varsity games Krieger
would have to play against two
All-Americans. “Heck yeh I was
nevrous,” replied Paul when asked

thepinevitable question. “It was

something like the WPIAL ﬁnal
when we had to play Farrell and
Brian (Genera1ovich‘).'’ "
“They didn’t talk much," said
Krieger. uncrossing his long
limbs. “Terry (Dischinger) said
‘to say hello to Jerry for me.”

Grady Pleased With Progress
Of Panther Swimming Squad

By GERRY lVIAZO

“They’re in ﬁne condition,

but they still haven’t got the

feel of the water yet,” remarked Coach Ben Grady, as he
watched his swimming squad loosen up in the water during
practice at the Arsenal High School pool.

The veteran Pitt mentor, starting his 23rd year of coach-
ing the mermen, commented that his team is “coming along
slowly, but still getting there, nevertheless.”

‘‘It’s early yet, and our season doesn’t open until January 6

against West Virginia, so we’re not fully set so far," said Grady. “We
had some informal relays against Carnegie Tech last week, and I
thought our men looked all right) '

I old marks from the record books

Their times were fair, consideringf
that they were not really geared?
up for competition as yet.”
Big Men Back
With five record—breaking let-
termen returning from last year’s
team. which posted six victories in
nine encounters, Grady appears to
be in rather good shape.

Leading the mono.°;r-am win-
ners are co-captains Tony Sans-
field and Carl Warnes. both of
whom contributed a great deal
to making last campaign’s squad
the fastest in Pitt history. Sars~
field broke two records in the
buterﬂy, while Warnes also set
a pair of new marks in the
breast—stroke.

Jerry Sollinger also erased two

in his speciality, D the backstroke.
Jackie Hayes and Richie Rush, the
0 t h e r Panther record-breakers,

will also be returning for 1962.

In addition, the sophomore Le-
vine twins, Robert and Ronnie, of
Schenley High School fame, will
both certainly strengthen the Cat
natators.

and will be seeking their si::1;hO

team title.

Coach Rex Peory plans to take
18 grapplcrs to the iiournarnent.
Since this will cause :3 duplication
in some weight classes, Peery will
have to spec-ilfyo before the tourna-
ment opens which man. will be the
oﬁicial ieani entrant.

Daryl Kelvington is the only
Panther w"1~c:stl.cr who won a title
last year. It \VilS the second time

If you think you're seeing more Marlboro men
lately, you're right. More than 25,000
smokers all over the country are switching 
to Marlboro every month! 1

You'll know why when you try them.

Marlboro is the filter cigarette with the unﬁltered
taste. The secret of the flavor is the famous
Marlboro recipe from Richmond, Virginia . . . and
the pure white Selectrateﬁlter that goes with it.

Try Marlboro and judge for yourself.‘ On or 
Off campus, you get a lot to like.    """ "
