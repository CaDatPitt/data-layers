Blood supplies in Pittsburgh
are currently at such emergency
levels that surgeons are postponing
major operations and the Central
Blood Bank of Pittsburgh is
undertaking an all-out campaign for
donations.

“All operations requiring blood,
such as open heart surgery,
ruptured arteries and bleeding
ulcers, are categorized as major

surgery. These cannot commence
unless the supply of blood is
adequate,” said Dr. Marshall
Webster, .assistant professor of
surgery at Pitt’s medical school.
“It’s a life or death situation.”

Right now, blood supplies are
quickly depleting. The severe
winter weather, the ﬂu epidemic
and the recent holidays are
discouraging potential donors,
according to Bonny Cersosimo,

1 Former Amin Minister
 Relates Ugandan Story

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer
People around the world are
responsible for keeping an eye on
happenings in the African country
of Uganda, according to Henry
Kyemba, former Minister of Health

7 in that country. 7

“The people of Uganda are bein
tortured under one man by the
name of Idi Amin Dada,” Kyemba
told a Student Union Ballroom
audience Wednesday night. '

Kyemba, who left Uganda in 1977
after five years of service in the
Amin administration, is on a lecture
tour of the United States and
Canada. He is. the author of the
book, ‘ ‘A State of Blood - The Inside
Story of Idi Amin.”

“I consider it a priviledge to be
able to stand here and talk to you
who are citizens of the greatest
democracy in the world,” Kyemba
began. He then requested a minute
of silence in memory of the
thousands of people killed in
Uganda.

In 1966, Milton Obote, with the
help of General Idi Amin,
established himself as President of
Uganda. He named Amin head of‘

‘_-.1”, the army.

“He (Obote) thought Amin was
so naive that he would not threaten
his continuation in office, ’ ’ Kyemba
stated.

In 1971 Amin turned the tables
against Obote and used the army to
take over the country, Kyemba said.

In August, 1972 Amin expelled
5,000 Asians--mostly Pakistani and
Indian shopkeepers and technic-
ians--creating an economic depres-
sion. Amin labeled these people

 products of British Imperialism.

A A tent personnel.

Since Amin seized control he has
terrorized the people of Uganda.
Thousands of people have reported-
ly been killed. One report published
in Newsweek last year claimed
250,000 persons were murdered.

There are currently 11 million

- people living in Uganda, including a

small number of foreigners and
some Americans.

Kyemba stated Amin has retain-
ed his reign with the help of three
police-type organizations—the
Public Safety Unit, the Bureau of
State Research, and the military
police.

“These units are responsible for
disembowelment, beheading, and
torture of our brothers and sisters, ’ ’
Kyemba said.

Amin, who holds numerous titles
including Field Marshall, Doctor,
and President for Life, has been a
‘‘clown and buffoon to various
nations around the world,” Kyem-
ba said.

In the summer of 1976 Amin and
his guards were humiliated by an
Israili commando raid at Entebbe
which saved a planeload of hostages
hijacked to Uganda. Last February,
Amin falsely accused President
Carter of amassing an army of
marines at Ugandan borders.

Kyemba claimed Amin has ﬁlled
his administration with incompe-
He said the
Minister of Commerce is a former
chauffeur and a butcher currently
holds the position of Minister of
Information.

Kyemba criticized countries a-
round the world, including the
United States, for trading arms and
supplies with Amin. Kyemba said
the U.S. alone imports $400-S00

      

public relations director of the
Central Blood Bank.

She said last year’s supply was
adequate because the Langley Hall
explosion prompted enough people
to donate--the majority of which
were Pitt students.

She said enough blood has to be
available constantly because it
takes six hours of processing before
the donated blood is usable.

“Enough blood has to be

available at all times in case of give blood two or three times ayear.

emergency situations,” said Cerso-
simo, “and an annual increase of 10
to 15 percent to the demand for
blood makes it a struggle to stay
ahead of the game.”

Webster reiterated Cersosimo’s

sentiments, attributing the increase
in the demand for blood to the
country’s aging population and the

— more frequent use of major surgery.

They said more donors should

“If people gave two or three
times a year, then the supply would
be adequate, especially since blood
only remains usable for 21 days,”
said Cersosimo.

And if a doctor must resort to
using a related blood type--which is
sometimes the case during prolong-
ed shortages--there is a continuous
danger of the body rejecting the
blood, prompting major complica-
tions. '

Jul Magrini was appointed Night

dismissal of Rosemarie Freeman by

J -Board Cases Up Past Year

By.JIM MORRISON

The number of cases brought
before the Campus Judicial Board
during the fall term increased over
the previous year, according to Al
Bowen, coordinator of the Campus
Judicial System.

Records show the J udicial_Board
issued a total of 14 guilty verdicts
stemming from fall term violations
of the student code of conduct. All

Residence Hall Judicial Board.
Several cases were dismissed
because of lack of evidence, Bowen
said.

The University Judicial System is
made up of: the Residence Hall
Judicial Board; the Campus Judi-
cial Board, which handles code
violations outside of the residence
halls; and the University Review
Board, which handles appeals find
also has sole jurisdiction over

Bowen, who serves as moderator
in Judicial Board proceedings,
attributed the increase in case load
to more stringent enforcement of
rules by this year’s resident
assistants.

“Last year (fall, 1976) there was
a noticeable decline in student code
violations brought before the
Board. Ithink it was due to the fact
that R.A.’s were ﬁling fewer

with the directions of a University
official and disregard for quiet

board ranged from residence hall
reprimands to suspensions from
residence hall for various periods of
time.

Last term, one student, ignoring
the directions of an area coordina-
tor, took a keg of beer into the
dormitories. He was placed on
residence hall probation for the rest
of the term.

In another case heard by the
Campus Judicial Board a student
was found guilty of falsifying

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Credit for ROTC 1

Accreditation for ROTC courses has been an issue on cam-
pus—and an editorial topic in this newspaper—-more than once
during the past few years. Now, the'College of Arts and Sciences
Council is again discussing the possibility of ROTC accreditation.

As reported on Wednesday, ROTC representatives are unhappy
about the fact that, as long as ROTC courses receive no credit,
cadets must take 136 credits to graduate——16 more than regular
CAS undergraduates.

“This often runs into monetary problems,” ROTC spokesman
Scott Wagner said. “We are forced to take extra credits--at $43

‘per credit—during the spring and summer terms, without the

promise of getting any accreditation. It seems unfair.”

While we, as students, can sympathize with those who bemoan
tuition costs, it is difficult to find much appeal in Wagner's lament.
Many University undergraduates, some of them with career in-
terests in mind, involve themselves in extracurricular activities that
necessitate a slower-than-normal rate of matriculation, which often
results in greater expense for those students. Other students simply
take more than the required number of courses, hoping that
somehow those “extras” will enhance their not-always-bright em-
ployment potential.

The financial burdens incurred by those students and the expense
endured by ROTC cadets may not be strictly analogous, but the
situations are similar.

We wonder how University administrators would react to
suggestions that they grant credit to students who spend several
hours a week working on the Student Government Board, one of
the SGB committees, or, for that matter, The Pitt News. It seems
to us that ROTC instruction should be considered every bit as ex-
tracurricular to a liberal arts education as any of the above-
mentioned student endeavors.

Also, if the ROTC request for accreditation is to be based upon a
tale of financial woe, it should not be forgotten that cadets have ac-
cess to Government stipends not generally available to students in
pursuit of other careers. And, as the ROTC advertisements con-
stantly remind us, cadets are guaranteed “well-paying” jobs when
they graduate. What other department in CAS can promise the
same?

Letters to the Editor

The Rewriting of Middle East History

If not for the tragic overtones, it
would be humorous to read the
rewriting of history by Zionist
apologists. The fervor of the
recitation of how Israel, while
overcoming repeated attacks and
fantastic odds, has been able to
double and treble its land holdings,
is rivaled only by David's biblical
conquest of Goliath.

Not only do the zealots disagree
with Graham’s views, they also
would not defend to the death her
right to say them. This is not
surprising if you understand
democracy, Israeli style.

First of all, The Pitt News

wouldn't have had this problem in
Israel. The censors would have
quashed the article and saved the
editorial staff from its careful

sarily those of this newspaper...”
retreat. However, if obdurate in the
face of this opposition, the staff
(non-Jews that is) could be
subjected to “administrative de-
tention,” a euphemism I for
imprisonment without charge. If
you were lucky, you might even get
a secret trial, which, while not
allaying the concern of family and
friends, would at least put an end to
your uncertainty.

gon, the capital, and Hue, the
imperial capital. Vietcong attacked
the United States Embassy and the
South Vietnamese Presidential
Palace in Saigon, but were turned
away. Vietcong stayed in Hue for a
month, during which time 10,000
soldiers and civilians died. Sections
of both cities were leveled by
rockets and bombs launched by
both sides.

The United States had to ﬁght in
the cities, destroying South Viet-
namese population centers, a boon
to the Vietcong whether they won
the offensive or not.

After three weeks, 165,000
Vietcong and 500 Americans were
dead. Two million refugees were
left to form yet more refugee camps.
Many South Vietnamese people
entered those camps as refugees.
Many left as Vietcong.

The American military viewed
Tet as a major defeat for the enemy.
The American public and import-
antly, the American press, thought
otherwise.
what the war was really like. The
optimism of the Johnson 
tration was shattered, viewed by
critics as half-truths in the name of
American propaganda. For the first
time, inﬂuential media people
raised questions as to the probabil-
ity of an American victory.

Scenes from Vietnam had been
broadcast back to this country
before, but the scope of the death
and destruction reached a new high.

American living rooms were
presented with an intimate look at
Vietcong corpses lining the streets
of Saigon. Reported numbers of
deaths and casualties reached more
than 500 weekly. Although more
Vietcong than Americans were lost,
the specter of death haunted many
Americans as it neverhafd before.

People were seeing T

It took Tet, with hundreds of
thousands dead and wounded, to
teach the Americans--if they
learned at all--that what Undersec-
retary of State George Ball said in
1964, and what Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara knew
when he quit in 1967, was
absolutely right: American escala-
tion was self-defeating. The more
Americans put in South Vietnam,
the angrier the. South Vietnamese
became, many of them joining the
Vietcong. The Vietnamese had, in
one form or another, been ﬁghting
for independence for close to 1,000
years. No matter how many men it
took they would keep ﬁghting. A
war could not be won under those
conditions.

Many disagreed with Ball and
McNamara, and Tet became a
reality. The historical ramifications
now are well-known: America’s war
policy changed, anti-war protests
grew and would not stop growing,
and President Johnson halted the
bombing of North Vietnam and
announced he was not a candidate
for re-election. Peace negotiations
began in May, 1968.

Tet, and the entire Vietnam
experience, should be well-remem-
bered, studied and discussed. Peo-
ple must read the new books and
see the new ﬁlms with cautious eyes
and open minds. People shouldn't
allow history to be rewritten or
distorted by those still searching for
an American victory.

Tet left us stunned, hurt and
staggered. lt graphically taught us
the futility of any war effort in
Vietnam. And though it would take
ﬁve more years for the war to come
ofﬁcially to an end, after Tet, the

end was near.

One has to be sympathetic with
these measures; after all, survival is
at stake. Look at how Nixon reacted
when surrounded by enemies on all
sides. Things like the Constitution
or basic human rights can't be
allowed to get in the way.

Before all this is dismissed as
anti-Semitic pap (i.e. criticism of
Israel), read what some Israelis» say
about this paradise carved out of
wasteland. Felicia Langer’s “With
My Own Eyes” or Ephriam
Seuela’s “Farewell Israel” would
be good primers.

Fanaticism is the disease of those
who are close to the Middle East
problem. Facts defy analysis when
clouded with hysteria and paranoia.
Peace is not in the cards today,
because it is never born of reason or
right. It will come only when both
sides find it beneﬁcial at the same
time, and it won't be beneﬁcial for
Israel as long as the U.S. spends
three billion a year to keep it aﬂoat.
Peace might require them to make it
on their own.

Moving Targets and o Pothole Lomen

By BOB LABRIOLA

If one were to measure the city’s
health by the circulation of traffic
along the major throughways,
Pittsburgh certainly has a severe

case of hardening of the arteries. 1

The weather,’ along with»PAT and
PennDOT (Pittsburgh’s version of
Heckyll & J eckyll), has made even
the most commonplace journey an

‘aggravating experience.

City Hall seems to have decided
that all citizens should be made
aware of the inefficiency of PAT
(positively always tardy), as road
crews have buried most of the
parking spaces beneath mountains
of snow. V The meter maids,
Oakland's angels of mercy, remain
on the prowl, however, making
travel by automobiles an impract-
ical and expensive alternative.

And so, thousands of commuters
get to gamble daily, Las Vegas-
style, wagering their grades, jobs

and possible cases of frostbite

against the dependability of the
Port Authority.

A printed schedule—or tip-sheet,
if you prefer—serves a useful
purpose as either article of clothing
to deflect the wind, or nourishment
during the marathon vigil. The
taste left in one’s mouth after such a
snack is far less acrid than that
which remains after the customary
odyssey involved in getting from
one place to another.

Using a‘ logic Joseph Heller,
author of “Catch-22,” would love,
drivers quote the almighty schedule
to explain a myriad of situations.

Buses, already running behind ‘

schedule, have been known to wait
at the beginning of the line in order
to leave at the next scheduled time.

C A TCH/A/G THE B2/5 0/v /i F17 ;

/I Ca/MUTEKS/r PA sr/H5

Then that bus quickly falls behind
its new schedule because of the
traffic and large packs of com-
muters waiting at the bus stops.

To the people whoask why the
bus waited before it set out, the
driver‘ will look at his watch and
answer, “Well, Mac, the next bus
isn’t supposed to leave for another
eight minutes. We do have a
schedule to keep, you know.”

No mention is made of the fact
that this bus is the last bus, and the
next bus, which should be this bus,
is still stuck somewhere downtown.
Confused? You’re supposed to be.

Boarding the bus has also become
something of a challenge. Drivers,
reluctant to come to a complete stop
for fear of getting stuck in the snow,
simply slow down and open the
doors. The object of this little game

is to board the bus on the fly, which
should soon give new meaning to
the phrase “missing the bus.”

So the passengers cannot claim
riding the bus is dull, PAT has
added a new dimension for

excitement. Within the last week,

1’

buses have broken down at the
corner of Fifth Avenue and Criag
Street, and run into a utility pole. It
may be difﬁcult to find a doctor
willing to make a housecall, but
PAT will drive a bus right up your
lawn and come to a crashing halt on
your front porch.

Not to be outdone, PennDOT has
provided commuters with streets
such as S. Bellefield Avenue (which
closely resembles the surface of the
moon). Bus drivers love to travel
Bellefield at a relatively high speed,
causing the vehicle to rock and

pitch. Any standing passengers
able to keep their feet through this
little trial are given an autographed
picture of the Port Authority's new
mascot, Francis, the talking mule.

As the city adjusts to reach new
snowfall, and spring approaches,
the buses are able to get closer and
closer to being on time. But in order
to stay well below the minimum
efficiency level, the Port Authority
provides commuters with buses
lined with a layer of grime and with
windows that are jammed open. (It
is taken for granted that in the
summer these same windows will
be jammed shut.)

In the long run, all these
inconveniences contribute to make
the Pittsburgh bus system PAT
(perfectly awful transportation).

Julie Graham’s column of Jan.
16 (Coal Strike Supported) is
somewhat difﬁcult to reply to
because of a paucity of logical
thread in her argument. Somehow,
American Capitulation in Southeast
Asia, together with the formation
of the OPEC cartel, have resulted
in: The Alaskan pipeline, nuclear

like mushrooms.” Clever!) and
BCOA intrasigence. Apparently,
we have here a class struggle
among the third world, environ-
mentalists and the UMWA prole-

oil giants and coal operators on the
other. How grandl

What does Graham really want?
Her column was nominally about
the UMWA strike-. I gather she
would have the BCOA accede to all
UMWA demands forthwith. What
is an issue here, as with most labor
strikes, is productivity. The coal

I might remind Graham and other
writers of this kind of puerile drivel
that the UMWA membership,

Choosing Clinic A Big Step

By PATRICIA GOURLEY

Editor’s Note: This is the second of
a two-part article on three birth
control clinics--Pittsburgh Free
Clinic, Planned Parenthood Assoc-
iation of Pittsburgh and Magee
Women’s Hospital Ob-Gyn clinic.

Pittsburgh Free Clinic is located
in the basement of the East End
Christian Church, on the corner of
Alder Street and Highland Avenue
in East Liberty. When one walks
into the waiting room, one notices
its non-clinical atmosphere; there
are brown and yellow walls,
cushioned bed-like couches and a
stereo for patients’ use. The room is
dominated by a large sign listing the
patient’s rights. The relaxed
atmosphere is carried over to the
rest rooms, which are decorated
with amusing and educational
grafﬁti.

Uniforms are a rarity at
Pittsburgh Free Clinic . Most of the
staff, 26 full-time workers and 112
volunteer professionals and para-
professionals, dress casually. Two
full-time and one part-time female
nurse practicioners do most of the
clinic work, including the examina-
tions. Two male gynecologists work

at the clinic Wednesday and‘

Thursday evenings for special
services, including IUD insertion.
Education about birth control
methods is conducted by a woman
employee who received on-the-job
training. Personal, pregnancy and
abortion counselling is done by
professionals with degrees in public
health, mental health and social
work.

The day to day operation of the
clinic is the responsibility of the
clinic director and the program
managers. The clinic’s medical
standards are monitored by its
medical director. Planning and
policymaking are responsibilities of
an 18-member board of directors;
nine board members are represen-

* tatives of clinic programs, and nine

are community members.

Besides its contraceptive care
clinic, which has 5,000 active
patients, Pittsburgh Free Clinic
offers a variety of other services.
All of these services are free, but
donations are encouraged. One of
these services is an evening clinic
that offers general medical and
gynecological care, laboratory test-
ing and veneral disease testing and
treatment. Pregnancy, abortion,
birth control and personal counsell-
ing also are offered, along with
information and referral services.

The clinic also has a patient’s
rights program that offers informa-
tion to poor patients, including
obtaining aid to pay bills.
Community Information on national
health insurance and the national
health service also is given in this
program.

An adolescent preventive health
program available to youth groups,
parent groups and professional
groups also is offered at Pittsburgh
Free Clinic. This program includes
sexuality counselling, drug and
alcohol abuse counselling, group
referral counselling services and
individual youth counselling.

Planned Parenthood Association
of Pittsburgh has four centers: 437
Beaver St. in Sewickley, Chartiers
Avenue and Bruce Street in
McKees Rocks, Medical Center
East in East Liberty and 102 Ninth
St. downtown.

The recently remodeled down-
town Planned Parenthood center,
with its long windows and white
walls, has a clinical atmosphere.
There are several waiting rooms
resembling those in a doctor’s
office--single chairs and coffee
tables piled with magazines.
Education on birth control methods
is done in a large room similiar to a
classroom, with a blackboard and
hardback chairs. Top-40 music
quietly plays in the background;
everyone, from the doctors to the
method counsellors, wears white
lab coats.

Planned Parenthood’s Ninth
Street center has six gynecologists,

two of them men, who serve on a
rotating basis. The doctors examine
patients with a nurse present.
Method education is conducted by
nurses during the week, and by a
trained clinic employee on week-
ends. All lab work is done by lab
technicians; professionals trained
in public health, mental health and
social work do the counselling.

The clinic offers general gyneco-
logical care and tests and treatment
of venereal disease. Planned
Parenthood’s downtown office will
terminate a pregnancy within eight
weeks of the woman’s last
menstrual period. A vasectomy
clinic, offering both counselling and
surgery, is open Friday evenings.
Two or three Saturdays a month, a
teen clinic is open.

Weekday contraceptive care
patients are charged $30 a year at
Planned Parenthood; teen clinic
patients are charged $12 a year.
These fees do not include the cost of
the method.

Magee-Women’s Hospital Ob-
Gyn clinic is in the hospital at
Forbes Avenue and Halket Street in
Oakland; the center entrance is next
to the hospital emergency room
entrance. The center’s large
waiting room seats over 200
patients. Muzak hums in the
background, intermitently inter-
upted by a voice paging a doctor.
Uniformed nurses bustle back and
forth.

Each of the center’s five units,
which offer gynecological and
obstetric care, has one full-time
registered nurse and several
full-time nurse’s aides. Method
education is conducted by a woman
who received on-the-job training.
Because Magee-Women’s hospital
houses the department of obstetrics
and gynecology of Pitt’s School of
Medicine, all of the clinic’s doctors
are residents in their first to fourth
years. These doctors work in one
unit for three months. Although
volunteers are a regular part of the
hospital, they are not a regular part
of the center staff. The center’s

policy and procedures are deter-
mined by the hospital adminstration
and the department of _obstetrics
and gynecology. ’ ‘

Family planning is only one of the
services available at the Magee
center; a full range of gynecological
and obstetric care is available to all
patients. In conjunction with the
department of urology at Pitt’s
Medical School, the center offers an
outpatient vasectomy clinic.
Nutritional advice, focusing on
pregnant women but open to all
patients, also is available.

A new patient enrolled in the
family planning program must pay
$15 for the ﬁrst visit. This does not
include the cost of the contraceptive
or lab work.

Before making an appointment at
one of these Pittsburgh birth control
clinics, one should consider several
factors. One of the most obvious is

‘GaySupporters’Reorgane

ByMAR'I‘HA GARVEY
Pin News Slaffwriter

“I looked for a University gay
rights group as soon as I got on
campus,” said Tim Bennett,
co-founder of Gay Supporters at
Pitt (GSP). “I was told there had
been a group called Gay Students at
Pitt, but that there was no interest
in reviving it. So I spent the last
term going to meetings of other gay
rights groups, and organizing this
one.” GSP’s first general meeting
in January drew 50 people; the
second drew 60.

“We consider ourselves a
political force--that’s one of the
reasons for the name change,”
Bennett said. “We welcome all
members, both straight and gay.
Our very ﬁrst goal, though, is to
form a constitution. GSP lost
recognition as a campus organiza-
tion last year. In order to get
recognition and apply for a budget,
we have to
constitution to SGB for approval.”
GSP will learn whether they have
official recognition by the end of
February.

cost; Pittsburgh Free Clinic is me
cheapest clinic, Planned Parent-
hood the most expensive.

Another important consideration
is the professionalism of the clinic
staff. If one wants to be examined
by a gynecologist, Pittsburgh Free
Clinic is not the place to go. At
Magee Women’s Hospital Ob-Gyn
clinic, doctors serve for only three
months, so it is likely one will not
see the same doctor twice. At
Planned Parenthood, one can see a
particular clinic doctor on a regular
basis.

All of the Pittsburgh family
planning centers are easily access-
ible by bus, so location is no
problem. Pittsburgh Free Clinic is
located on the 73 Highland Park bus

GSP is currently run by a steering
committee, which chairs its weekly
meetings. Three other committees
have also been formed. V The
projects committee is writing the
GSP constitution. The communica-
tions committee will maintain
contact with all the GSP members as
well as other gay rights organiza-
tions.‘

If GSP gets University recogni-
tion, an office and a telephone, the
committee will direct a hotline.
“We have no wish to overwhelm
other gay organizations who
provide counseling services,” said
committee member Charlie Hecka-
thorne. “We will not counsel, but
refer callers to the appropriate
organization.”

The GSP publicity committee has
placed ads in The Pitt News and
posted notices on campus. A fourth
committee is now being formed to
address the needs of feminism
within the group. “We identify
feminism as inseparablefrom gay
issues,” said one GSP member.
“We want both the men and the

women in GSP to share responsibil-
ity for feminist issues.”

GSP’s future plans include
working with RAGE (Rapid Action
for Gay. Equality) to revive a gay
coffeehouse in the First Unitarian
Church.

“We want to provide a viable
social alternative to the gay bars in
the area,” said Tim Bennett.
“Also, younger gay people often
have no place to socialize because
they are underage. We want to
create an atmosphere where they
are comfortable.”

GSP is also planning activities‘ on
campus, including an evening of
arts this term, and a celebration of
Gay Pride Week in June.

“We have a number of intangible
goals,” said one steering commit-
tee member. “We would like to
sensitize the faculty and students to
the issues that involve gay rights.
We also wish to express concern for
those gay persons whose lives and
jobs would be threatened by their
coming out of the closet. They have
a voice through us, and we want
them to know it.”

  

Free Clinic and Planned Parenthood
use a code name, “Lizzy.” "If, for
any reason, either of these clinics
must call a woman and she is not at
home, they leave a message that
“Lizzy ” called.

As for atmosphere, Pittsburgh
Free Clinic is the most relaxed and
personal clinic. Magee the most
formal.

The Incredible Shrinkiggk Women

‘Women ’s Films ’ Not About Women

By MARTHA GARVEY
P'rIl”‘News Staff Writer

The year 1977 was supposed to
be the year of “the women’s ﬁlm.”
Diane Keaton and Jane Fonda
stared out at us from news

magazines; “Annie Hall” clothes‘

had their own boutique in New York
and Anne Bancroft and Shirley
MacLaine proved that once women
hit 40 they don’t all turn into Shelley
Winters.

But what exactly is this
“women’s ﬁlm”? Hollywood pro-
ducers (mostly male) had estab-
lished writers (mostly male) create
situations for bankable established
stars (who were female). This
phenomenon was in turn covered by
the media. Barbara Walters not
withstanding, the media are mostly
male-oriented. So if we were just
counting -heads, it would make as
much sense to call “Annie Hall” a
lobster ﬁlm. After all, there seem
to be more lobsters than women in
the movie. .

But the question here is not how
many women can filmmakers
squeeze into one movie. Are these
movies any different from many we
have seen before? glfa women’s film
is to provide an alternative “men’s
ﬁlm”, whatever it may be, they
must present something new.

Film has the power to entertain,
distract and even hypnotize. But it
also has the power to suggest and
sometimes create new possibilities.
Film can expand what we know and
feel about ourselves and other

world. “Stars Wars” mirrors our
need for simple solutions; good and
evil become a matter of the faster
light saber or the quicker ship. But
“Star Wars” has also magniﬁed,
perhaps even distorted, our increas-
ing distaste for the complex.

ARTS

Women's films have a similar
power for change. We are talking
about human beings not light
sabers. These films have the power
to examine and perhaps to
transform the stereotypes we have
lived and limited ourselves with.

Both “Julia” and “The Turning
Point” have become hits. “Julia
has made friendship a hot item, and
“The Turning Point” may start a
whole new career for dancer
Mikhail Baryshnikov, although it
may have more to do with how he
looks in tights than his charming,
but heavily accented, English.

“Julia” looks at the recent past
(World War II). “The Turning
Point” looks at the present and the
future through two generations of
dancers. “Julia’s”.value could be
in looking at history in a new way, in
uncovering the past of half the
human race. “The Turning Point”
could be a way of exploding

stereotypes, of expanding the way.

people.

Film can transform our

In “The Turning Po|nt”—two women must make choices between love and

work, but are satisfied with neither.

we see ourselves. But, collectively,

the two movies could be called the
story of the incredible shrinking
woman.

In “Julia,” playwright Lillian
Hellman (Jane Fonda) smuggles
money through Nazi Germany,
inspired by-the courage of her friend
Julia (Vanessa Redgrave). Julia is
resistance fighter, doctor and
amateur saint. Inevitably, such
virtue cannot live, and Julia is dead
by the end of the movie. She leaves
her friend Lillian to moon about
courage and friendship, and to
make a lot of money from this
movie. Without Juia’s shining
example, Lillian’s courage has less
to do with getting killed in Germany
and more to do with not passing out
at theater parties. ‘

“The Turning Point” does no
better. It seems to offer more at
first. Men and women are seen
working together in a ballet
company. Husband and wife teach
side by side. Shirley MacLaine
plays Deedee, a dancer who left
New York to marry, have children
and live in exile in the Midwest.

But wait, Deedee teaches dance
with her husband Wayne (Tom
Skerrit). Their daughter’s career
goals are seen as just as important
as their son’s. Wayne is sensitive,
gentle and passionately uninvolved
with his children. It begins to look
like the ﬁlm is offering alternative.

But once Deedee and her
daughter Emilia (Leslie Browne)
return to New York, hope fades.

Emilia tries her wings and her toe
/(‘.v,;.-//mwr/ .//H /’(/.'.'c 9)

Jane Fonda, as Liilian Hellman, had a chance to provide an Interesting per-
spective on women in’ history in “Julia.” But “Juiia”—and other “women’s
films’ ’—are nothing new.

 

A Poetry Reading:

Sounds and Sense

By MARC SELVAGGIO

Elizabeth Bishop reads her
poetry like a starving man reading a
grocery list; the words represent
something but he can’t remember

_what and reading it over and over

won’t satisfy the hunger. Fortu-
nately, Bishop’s poetry is not like
her reading. The peoms are not
descriptive statements, they are
rememberances; she doesn’t tell of
moment or emotion but shows it.

In “Manuelzinho” she speaks
indirectly to a man who gardens her
land in Brazil:

But her manner of reading made
it seem as if the lines had nothing T‘.
do with sound or sense. She didn’t
breath on the commas.

Her matter-of-fact tone, the
sound of deliberate understate-
ment, made the moments of humor
in her poems funnier, as in “Filling
Station” as she wonders about the
potted ﬂower which seems so
misplaced among the ﬁlth and says
“somebody waters the plant,/or
oils it, maybe.”

But this same voice weakens

The Rise and Fall of the Rock Concert

By JIM FARERI
Pitt News Staffwrner

Rock ‘n’ roll wouldn’t be rock ‘n’ roll without
the rock concert. Albums offer your favorite
group at their best, both in play and production.
Albums are cheaper than concerts. Albums are
lasting. Albums are without the pushing and
shoving, the smoke and the humidity.

But rock ‘n’ roll wouldn’t be rock ‘n’ roll
without the rock concert.

The rock concert is as integral a part of the art
as the bar chord. However, its face is rapidly
changing: from Madison Square Garden to the
Colosseum, rock is packing it in at the large con-
cert halls and taking up smaller residences.

The rock concert emerged in the 70’s as a thing
of gargantuan design. Woodstock had become
the ideal; bigger was better. Rock ‘n’ roll was the
gathering point of youth, and huge crowds at a
rock concerts signified the strength and validity
of youth culture. A rock concert was not only a
place to hear music, but as mini-society complete
with its own set of values—a place where
alienated young people could realize an ideal, if
transitory, world.

As the 70’s passed, these sixtyish notions of a
rock concert as a big happy family wore thin.
However, the papers continued to delight in
quoting the record-breaking attendance ﬁgures
at rock concerts and we still delighted in reading
them. Grueling tours of the major cities replaced
the festival ideal, and a group’s drawing power
and ability to endure long road trips became as
hot an item as their latest hit.

The demise of the big rock concert began when
some of the most established bands made the
not-so-startling discovery that they had become
wealthy legends. And legends do not need an
annual visit to the local hockey arena to retain
popularity; groups like the Stones, The Who and
Led Zepellin tour seldom.

The startling part came when newer, less
established performers began to experience dif-
ficulty filling large arenas. As rock merged with
country, jazz and pop, audiences for individual
bands were necessarily reduced. The notion of
the supergroup became less and less of a reality
as contemporary music diversified and a variety
of new tastes developed.

As new groups arrived on the scene, promoters
got smart and invested in smaller halls. Thus the
situation as it stands today; a plethora of groups
in smaller halls to smaller audiences.

In Pittsburgh the rise and fall of the large rock
concert finds an almost perfect stereotype. Big
concerts at the Civic Arena have largely given
way to smaller ones at places like the Stanley and
Leona theaters. The shrinkage continues as you
examine Oakland’s own Antonino’s, Pit-
tsburgh’s smallest “hall” with a seating capacity
of only a few hundred.

But to describe the decline of big rock concerts
as a fall is to do the phenomenon injustice. It is
no secret that the acoustics in places like the
Civic Arena leave much to be desired. And so
much smoking, screaming humanity under one
roof—in spite of any connotations of
brotherhood—doesnot find a warm place in

many hearts. Most rock fans, once they grow ac- L

customed to it, will find concerts in smaller halls
satisfying. You hear the music better, see the per-
formers instead of just movement on a distant
stage and, in most cases, are more comfortable.

Balanchine

By SALLY RAPPEPORT

Jo Ann McCarthy, full of
charisma, exquisite technique,
dynamic stage presence was the
highlight of Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre's performance last week-
end at Heinz Hall. McCarthy
dazzled the audience with her
portrayal of Sonia in “The Merry

 , idow”.

Partnered by Dennis Poole (as
Prince Danilo), the two danced .in
several lovely, romantic pas de
deux’s. Choreographically the
strongest part of the ballet, the pas
de deux’s were full of exciting and
innovative lifts.‘ Though the
difference in height between
McCarthy and Poole was somewhat
disturbing, their dancing made up
for it.

The corps de ballet also
yerformed well, but occasionally
seemed superﬂuous, partially be-
cause of the lavish scenery and
costumes that created a full picture .
However, the scenery, costumes

 _ lighting were usually effective.
 The other ballet performed,
“Prodigal Son,” was choreograph-
ed in 1919 by George Balanchine,
one of America’s most famous
choreographers. Unlike many
Balanchine ballets, ‘ ‘Prodigal Son”
had a dramatic theme based on the
biblical story. In the tale the
prodigal son runs away from home,
is seduced by a siren, and ﬁnally,
destitute, returns to his forgiving
father.

The leading roles in the ballet
were danced by Woytek Lowski,
guest artist in residence with
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre this
  n, and Charlene Gehm, guest
artist from the Joffrey Ballet.
Lowski did an excellent job in the
emotional part of the prodigal son,
demonstrating his exceptional act-
ing ability. Gehm, a beautiful
dancer, captured the sensuous,
teasing style of the siren.

The colorful decor designed by
George Rouaultand the exciting
music of Prokofiev played by the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
added to the piece, but in terms of
movement, the ballet seemed a bit
outdated. The dance patterns,
‘especially those of the corps, were
simple and uninspiring.

The dramatic essence of the role
of e prodigal son could have been
d$oped more through move-
ment; the siren’s role was also
choreographically weak. Overall,
the ballet illustrated how much
Balanchine has matured as a
choreographer since 1919.

Grapplers Sp

ByJIMLEWIS
Pin News Staff Writer

Injured Rande Stottlemyer and
Bill Bailey weren’t even supposed
to start in the Pitt wrestling team's
Wednesday night 31-9 win over
17th-ranked Clarion. But Stottlem-
yer (134 pounds) and Bailey (190
pounds)-—both Golden Eagle re-
cruits in high school—beat Clarion
with a super decision and a pin,
respectively, for the surprising
victory.

“I’ve been here ﬁve years,”
Stottlemyer said, “and that’s how
long it took to beat them. I don’t
want our team to get fat heads, but
it was an entire team effort-—it’s
one of the high points of our
season.”

“That’s all you hear about back
home—Clarion and Penn State,”
Bailey said. “Maybe that will
change a little.”

The Panthers’ winning complex-
ion never changed, thanks to
Stottlemyer and Bailey. Stottlem-
yer super-decisioned Randy Miller,
17-7, out-scoring his opponent in

the ﬁrst period 8-2 due to a quick
takedown and a near fall in the last
10 seconds.

“I don’t know if I won that
easily,” Stottlemyer said. “I died,
to be honest. But in the beginning
of the second period, I was able to
slide because of the lead I had
after the first period. At the end, I
had a little bit left. I didn’t wait,
didn’t hesitate—l took the ﬁrst
open shot, and it kind of
snowballed from there.”

Bailey stopped any chance of an
Eagle comeback by pinning Eric
Booth at 3:18 to up the score to
25-9, Pitt.

“I hoped to pin him early,”
Bailey said. “I knew I wasn't in
condition to go very long. He
(Booth) was a little shorter than
me—-he was short enough that I
could jack him up and put him on
his back.”

Stottlemyer’s and Bailey’s parti-
cipation in the match was surpris-
ing; Stottlemyer (out with the ﬂu
since early January) was intro-
duced along with his replacement,

Jackie Kline, during the pre-game
lineup announcement, while Bailey
(out with a knee injury since late
December) was told to return to the
locker room before his match as his
replacement, freshman Mike Pal-
ko, jumped rope.

“He (Panther head coach Dave
Adams) told me to go back there
and told Palko to warm up,” Bailey
said. “I think it was just a strategic
move to psych Clarion out.”

The Eagles were psyched out
from the beginning, losing _every
match and falling behind, 16-0,
before Dale Gilbert decisioned
Pitt’s 158-pounder, Tom Jones,
7-3. Except for Panther George
O’Korn’s rib injury-caused default
to Jay Hockenbrock, Pitt won every
match but Gilbert's.

Freshman 118-pounder Glenn
Maxwell started the evening by
decisioning Eagle Jan Clark, 12-6.
Jose Martinez (126 pounds) beat’

Canisius Canned, 82-6 3

* By-BOB LABRIOLA
-Pill News Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers staked Canisius
to a 10-point lead before turning the
Golden Grifﬁns’ upset dreams into
a nightmare, 82-66, last night at the
Field House.

The scheduled starting time for
the game was 8 p.m., but the
Panthers didn’t show up until there
were five minutes gone in the game
and Canisius was up, 12-2.

It was a combination of the ﬂu and
the blahs, as the Panthers almost
were caught looking ahead to
Sunday’s battle with crosstown rival
Duquesne. Pitt could do no right in
the early going, committing four
turnovers, and missing its ﬁrst six
shots in the opening four minutes.

Larry Harris, usually deadly from

I anywhere within the conﬁnes of the

Field House, missed his first ﬁve
ﬁeld goal attempts, and the crowd
of 2,831 began to wonder if the
Morris Harvey basketball team had
transferred to Canisius. Wayne
Williams, who continues to do
exactly what the Panthers need in
each game, broke the ice with a long
jumper, then added another just to
prove the ﬁrst was no ﬂuke, and Pitt
was on the way.

Pitt then decided the time had
come for talent to reign over
emotion, outscoring the Griffins,
19-8, to assume a 21-20 lead.
Harris, colder than a Buffalo winter
in the opening minutes, suddenly
caught ﬁre, hitting his next eight
ﬁeld goal attempts. The 6-6 senior

was six-for-six for the rest of the
ﬁrst half, and also tickled the twine
on his ﬁrst two attempts in the
second half, en route to a
season-high 33 points.

For the fourth game in a row, Pitt
shot better than 50 percent from the
ﬂoor (33 of 64), and the Panthers
again displayed ﬁnebalance as four
starters scored in double ﬁgures.

Canisius was never in the
rebounding battle, and the entire
Griffin squad outrebounded Sam
Clancy only 21-15. Four Panthers
had more rebounds than the
Canisius leader, as Pitt enjoyed a
lopsided 42-21 advantage off the
glass.

“They came out in the ﬁrst half,
and really took it to us,” Tim
Grgurich said. “If we come out for
the first half like that on Sunday
against Duquesne, we’ll be down
20-0.”

Williams played another ﬁne
game at both ends of the floor,
ﬁnishing with 16 points and ﬁve
steals. Still a bit rough around the
edges as a point guard, Williams
makes up for any errors with
natural ability and hustle. The 6-2
junior converted 70 percent from
the ﬂoor, and added six assists on
the offensive end, while blocking
two shots to go along with the steals
on the defensive end.

Clancy played his usual game,
leading both teams in rebounds and
rim-rattling slams, and intimidating

anything that reached within six
feet of the basket. For brief periods

during both halves of the game,
Clancy completely dominated the
game, grabbing every rebound he
had a chance of getting and a few he
didn’t.

Terry Knight, usually known for

' his ﬁne shooting, showed the crowd

he could also ﬁnd the open man,
registering ﬁve assists. Knight,
who had an off-night from the ﬂoor
(two of ﬁve), made up for it at the
free throw line, canning seven out of
eight tries as the Panthers shot a
blistering 84 percent from the
charity stripe.

Harris was his old self after the
opening cold spell, shooting,
rebounding and dunking on the way
to his third 30-point effort of the
season.

‘ ‘Harris is a helluva player, ” said
Canisius coach Nick Macarchuck.
‘ ‘I saw him when he was a freshman
when I was at Providence, and he
has improved and developed. He’s
deﬁnitely one of the best forwards
we've played against all year.”

“Larry missed four or ﬁve shots
in the ﬁrst half that he should
usually make,” Grgurich said. “He
still wound up with 33 ‘points; you
ﬁgure it out.”

Looking ahead to Sunday’s battle
with Duquesne, Grgurich observed,
“Anytime you play Duquesne or
West Virginia, it's more a mental
game than a physical one.”

With the physical shape the
Panthers were in last night because
of the ﬂu, that might be just what
the doctor ordered.

downed Jim Herbert, 7-4, and
Mark Stepanovich (HWT) won by
default over Jack Cambell. All
this, added to Stottlemyer’s and
Bailey’s performances, resulted in
the ﬁnal lopsided score.

“It may have looked like a
slaughter according to the ﬁnal
score,” Adams claimed, "but it
wasn’t. Ifelt that the way the guys
were matched up, either team
could win by a big team score, but
the individual scores could be very
close. Actually, Iwas surprised by
the individual scores——we won big
at times.”

And two of those times were
courtesy of Stottlemyer and Bailey.

“It was important to them to
wrestle,” Adams said. “Both
wanted to be a part of it. Bailey
was about 70 percent ready—I felt
he could protect himself. I put him
in for sentimental reasons, basic-
ally. The other guy (Booth) was
powerful, but he let Bailey work his
style.”

That seemed to be the case all
night, as the aggressive-minded

“Our guys were pretty aggres-

The In visible Netminders Make Way for Tom Slivka

. ByJIMPANE
Pill News Staff Writer

Where have all the goalies gone,
long time passing? A good ques-
tion around the Pitt hockey circuit
lately, and like many good
questions, the answer isn’t close
behind.

At the season’s start, coach Len
Barcalow had his nets protected
three times over with two proven
goalies and a third-string backup.
Eight wins and seven losses later,
however, Barcalow ﬁnds himself
reporting his two seasoned net-
minders to the missing persons
bureau.

Pitt veteran Larry Newell and
Quebec-experienced Rich Cunning-
ham have been invisible men of
late, forcing freshman Tom Slivka
into the Panther cage with no ready
backup waiting on the bench.

V This situation creates a headache
the 68-year-old Barcalow could do
without, especially after his recent

. illness which was initially fearedto ,

, 1

have been a stroke. Though
Barcalow has been given a clean
bill of health by his doctors, he
isn’t so fortunate as far as his goal-
tending depth is concerned.

“Newell? I haven’t seen or heard
from him since the New York trip
(in December),” Barcalow said.
“He might be in China for all I
know. I haven’t heard from
Cunningham, either.”

So that leaves Slivka, who has
started the last ﬁve'games for Pitt,
performing admirably, registering

' two wins and three defeats. Chalk

one up for Barcalow, who needed
one more man to ﬁll his roster
during preseason tryouts and
added Slivka at the last minute.
Slivka turned out to be a
season-saver.

“We intended to keep Tommy as
our third man and carry him along
on all the trips,” Barcalow said.
“Right now, I'm glad we did.”

Slivka’s glad he did, too. He’s
now playing as much as.he did in

High School (Swissvale 

while picking up much-needed
college experience.

“I can see a big change in my
concentration,” Slivka said. “You
have to concentrate more in

college, because there are so many

TOM SLIVKA

I ,

 

guys that can put the puck in the
net.”

As far as the case of the missing
goalies goes, Slivka is as bewil-
dered as everyone else. A

“I really don’t know where they
are,” he said. “I couldn’t tell you
what’s going on.

“But I’ll tell you one thing, I
have a lot of respect for Larry.
Being a rookie, I had a lot to learn
when I came in here, and I learned
by watching Larry. Now that he’s
gone, I’ve been teaching myself.”

Now that he’s gone, maybe
Barcalow is working on a new
strategy, as well. It’s called “jerk
hockey.”

“The ﬁrst guy I see loaﬁng out
there, he’ll be jerked off the ice so
fast his stick will be left behind,”
Barcalow said. “From now on, I’m
going to put guys in there who want
to play. No practice, no playing in
the games. Some of these guys
think just because they put on a
jock before a game they’re going to

, P191». Ihéyire wr0ng..”q

Barcalow is still left with ﬁnding
a backup goalie, however, and he
promised to do so soon.

“I’ll get somebody,” he vowed.
“We’re looking at a new guy right
now. If Cunningham or Newell

don’t show again, we’ll use their -w
guy.”

But for now, Slivka is the man of
the hour, and if conﬁdence wins
games, Pitt’s hockey club hasn’t a
worry.

“I always thought I was as
capable as either Larry or Rich,”
Slivka said. -

’ interview—women in

Friday, February 3, 1978-—THE PIT!‘ NEWS-—Page 11'

It's Time for Melissa Ludtke to Take Out the Garbage

Reading this column, you have probably already
noticed its title is “ln the Locker Room.” The
reason for the title is as obvious as it is attention-
getting. Except for a few isolated cases, there have
been very few women who have actually gone into a
locker room after a sporting event and conducted an
interview.

If Melissa Ludtke has her way, however, this
column’s title.may not be as attention-getting.
Ludtke is the sports reporter from Sports lllustrated
magazine who recently filed a substantial lawsuit
against New York City, major league baseball, its
commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, and the New York

entering the locker room at Yankee Stadium
following the final game of the World Series last fall.

If the contention in Ludtke’s case is proven correct
——that women are discriminated against by being
barred from locker rooms for the post-game
the locker room would
probably become a common occurrance.

As expected, Ludtke has reaped both a public
relations and financial bonanza since filing her suit.
She has appeared on the Today Show, as well as
other talk shows and news programs. The latest
appearance, on Howard Cosell’s Sports Magazine
show, leads many observers to believe the young
'reporter’s crusade must have some substance‘ to it,

1- since Cosell gave her all of the show’s 15 minutes of

Ludtke’s lawsuit is nothing but overpublicized
garbage. r

Ludtke is correct when she says women should be
allowed to do their job as sports reporters with the
same respect accorded any man, but breaking into as
private a male sanctuary as the locker room isn’t the
correct way.

 

Right now, women have all the advantages as far
as sports journalism is concerned. One tends to agree
with Pohla Smith, regional sports editor for United
Press International and part-time writing instructor
at Pitt, who has said that women, forced to conduct
their interviews outside the locker room, don’t fall
victim to the “pack” journalism that characterizes
post-game interview sessions.

‘‘I hate the kind of journalism where 15 to 20
reporters are clustered around one athlete, copying
down the same quotes and notes,” Smith said.
“That’s what those post—game interviews in the
locker room really amount to. I’m not into that sort

_ If women are forced to conduct their interviews in
the locker room, which they would almost feel
obliged to do if Ludtke’s case is passed_, the female
reporter would be grouped into this herd-like pack
and lumped into the category of being just another of
the boys—a fact that could lead to fewer jobs for
female reporters in the future. Potential employers
may reason that since a'woman’s going to be one of

the guys, why not get a guy to do the same kind of .

work.

Players, most of whom accommodate female
reporters’ wishes for interviews, would be in an
awkward situation, too. Women in the locker room,
as Pitt football player LeRoy Felder said, is
comparable to “a man going into a woman’s rest
room or locker room. It just isn’t right.”

Instead of venting her frustrations on some silly

project, perhaps Ludtke would do some good to the _

female sports reporter if she conducted a similar
crusade with the same fervor against the women who
dominate sports journalism today on the basis of
their looks, rather than their knowledge of sports.

But such a project would help neither Ludtke nor .
Sports Illustrated, from either a publicity or
monetary standpoint.

One has to dread the day when the title of this
column is no longer attention-getting. This is one

air time.

Panterette Tracksters Host Invitational

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt will host the second annual
Pitt Women’s Indoor Invitational
track meet tomorrow at Fitzgerald
Field House, beginning at 10 a.m.
Nineteen schools are expected to

, garticipate in the 12 events.
~~ J‘ Pitt head coach Alfreeda Goff

said that many outstanding ath-
letes will be participating in the
meet. A team score will be kept,
and the schools expected to
challenge for the title include:
defending champion Michigan
State, Penn State, Maryland, Ohio
State and Pitt.

Some schools, such as Delaware
State and Morgan State, will be
bringing only a partial squad,
hindering their chances of a team

title. Morgan State boasts one of
the ﬁnest mile-relay teams around.

i Last week, it placed second in the

Melrose Games at Madison Square
Garden with a time of 3:49.
Among the outstanding indivi-
duals competing are Paula Girven,
a high jumper from Maryland, and
Johonna Matthysen, a favorite in-
the quarter mile run, who recently
turned in a time of 50.4. The
defending cross country national

' champion is Kathy Mills of Penn

State, who will be competing in the
two- and three-mile runs.

It is hard for Goff to single out
the talent on the Pitt squad because
the women haven't had a meet yet
due to the inclement weather.

“It has deﬁnitely hurt us not
having a meet yet,” said Goff.

Panther Tankers to Oppose
  ‘PSU, ND of the Swim World  

‘** By KAREN KADILAK

Pitt News Staff Writer

The situation the Pitt swimm-
ing team now faces--meeting
Maryland and West Virginia in
back-to-back meets--is comparable
to a situation the Pitt football team
would face if it had to play Penn
State and Notre Dame in the span of
two weeks.

The team defeated Maryland
Saturday, 68-45, at Trees Pool.
,_.i -I, orrow, the Panthers travel to
1,, « jbrgantown to meet West Virginia.

While a football player may
dislike playing Penn State and
Notre Dame back-to-back, Pitt
swimmer Dale Pﬂaumer doesn’t
mind the idea of back-to-back meets
with Maryland and West Virginia
one bit.

“It won't be that bad.” the
sophomore from Philadelphia said
after _Saturday’s win over Mary-
land. “It’s not like-everyone is on
an emotional high where they’ll

ﬁve a hard time coming down and

eparing for West Virginia this
week. Sure, we’re excited about
today's win. Maryland’s an awfully
tough team. But we’re not going to
let it get in the way of next week's
meet at West Virginia.”

If Pitt defeats West Virginia, the
5-0 Panthers practically will be
guaranteed of an undefeated season
as they head into the Eastern
Intercollegiate competition to be
held at Trees Pool during the first
weekend in March.

“Cleveland State and Clarion
(the remaining meets on the Pitt
schedule) should pose no problems
for us,” Pﬂaumer said. “We’re
way ahead of them as far as
individual talent is concerned. If we
can beat West Virginia, we should
be in pretty good shape for the rest
of the season.”

Pﬂaumer is hoping he himself is
in good shape for the Mountaineers
Saturday. Like many of the Pitt
swimmers, Pﬂaumer has been
bothered with the ﬂu. As a result,
he wasn’t really up to par against
Maryland, ﬁnishing out of the
scoring in the 500- and 1,000-yard
freestyle events with two fourth-
place ﬁnishes.- Last week at Penn
State, Pﬂaumer placed in three
events (the 500-, and 1,000-yard
freestyle and the 200-yard butter-

ﬂy).

‘‘I’m on medication right now,”
Pﬂaumer said. “I’m just resting up
for Saturday. We'll be working
hard this week. It should be an
interesting meet at West Virginia. ”

“The girls don’t know where they
are because times have not been
established.

Goff also said the lineup she is
using Saturday is the same one she
was planning to use two weeks ago
at Ohio State.

“It was hard to choose the top
two girls in each event,” she said.
“We had many close ‘thirds’ and
the decision was extremely difficult
in some cases.”

The meet will not feature

preliminary heats except in the
50-yard dash and the hurdles.

Everything else will have only
ﬁnals.

Pantherettes competing are:
Becky Falck and Diane Miller (two-
and three-mile runs); Brenda Chor-
penning and Terese Walton (mile);
Louise Carlson and Chorpenning
(800); Lisa Haupt and Gwen.Murray
(50-yard dash); Michelle Bressant
and Leslie Palmer (hurdles); Marie
Ribik and Karen Krichko (high
jump); Carmen Scherich, Betsy

Dickmelster and Mary Beth Kulback
(shotput); Pam Gearing and Kim
Green (long jump): Murray and Lisa .
Sciullo (220); and -Janet Wilk and-
Maria Sciullo (440).

Running the 880 relay will be
Murray, Palmer, Pam. Shawl and
Linda Mitchell. The mile-relay
team vim consist of Mitchell, Wilk,

I-Iaupt and Barb Billek.

Pitt Plays Prince at Relays

ByMARlASCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

How did Tom Canty (the
ragged pauper in “The Prince and
the Pauper”) feel when he found
himself living in the King of

England’s majestic palace?

' About the sameias the Panther
track team will feel when they
compete in the Princeton Relays
Sunday, which will be held in the
Tigers’ luxurious multimillion-
dollar athletic‘ complex.

Comparing the Field House

track' to that of Princeton is like

constructing a G. C. Murphy's next
door to Saks Fifth Avenue. They’re
just not in the same league.

After two weeks of home meets,
Pitt travels to one of the East’s
premier indoor meets. Billed as
“The Penn Relays of the Indoor
Season,” the competition will
include strong teams, such as
Villanova and__Maryland.

Although the mile, the two-mile,
and the distance-and sprint-medley
relays will be the focal point of the
afternoon’s activities, there will be
several individual events. Pitt's

Swimmers Meet Clarion

By KATHY SABA
Pitt News Staff Writer’

The Pantherette swim team
needs a win, and tonight’s
encounter with Clarion State
College at 7 p.m. is a perfect
opportunity.

Clarion is the defending small-
college national champion, and
return several veterans to go with
the talents of three impressive
freshman.

Nan Farrar from Meadville
promises to be strong competition
in the 200-yard and 500-yard
freestyle, Polly Potter from North
Hills is the spring freestyler to
watch; and look for Moochie Eyles
from Franklin Regional in the
breastroke events. Clarion also‘has
a strong veteran diver in Aleta
Rice.

Pantherette coach Kate Mathi-
son premises the meet will be
close, much like the one last year
when Pitt won in the ﬁnal event.

This year, the women will be
swimming a sprint meet. Events
will be in the 50- and 100-yard
lengths.

“With this type of meet there are
more chances of upsets,” said
Mathison.

The only thing the Pantherettes
have to worry about is a ﬂu that has
hit some members of the team.

“We need the whole team to
swim together in order to win,”
said Mathison.

The Pantherettes travel to
Morgantown Saturday morning for

a noon meet with West Virginia
University.

record holder in the pole vault,
Gene Roach, will participate in his
specialty, while the high jump will
be manned by Dan Goodyear. Don
Maydak and Keith Taylor are
possibilities in the ‘ triple jump,
while Ed Taylor will long jump and
run the 60-yarddash.

Panther entrants in the high
hurdles are Dave Hensen and Keith
Bookert. ,

So, at least for a day, Pitt can play
the role of prince, and not pauper.

PITT-CLARION MEET

The Pantherette gymnastics
team, ranked 20th nationally and
fourth in the East, host defending
national champions Clarion State
tonight at Trees Hall at 7 p.m.

Pitt, 3-1, has yet to claim a
victory from 2-0 Clarion in four
years of competition, but the
Pantherette’s strong line of
freshmen could make a ﬁne
showing. Already this season,
four team records have been
snaped—two by freshman all-
around performer Myra Bachu-
chin, who set new marks in
vaulting and uneven bars.

Pitt coach Donna .DeMarino,
whoin four years has brought the
team up from 21st place to
seventh place at the Eastern
Regional Championships, said
increased competition and overall
improvements should up the
Pantherettes chances.
