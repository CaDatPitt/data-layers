Women Nominees
Feted At Lunch

75 Candidates Hear Discussions
On Election Spirit, Attitudes

 

 

Candidates for important executive
posts in the nine major women's ac-
tivities o1'ganizations, 75 nominees in
all, were told at a luncheon at 7Hein:I.
.-House on Friday, of the issues revolv-
ing about the election, now less than
-58 hours away.

Miss Thyrsa VV. Amos, dean of wo-
men, told the nominees that unless
they felt that their main interest is
the welfare of the organization, not
personal aggrandizement and that
unless they felt that they could work
equally well for th:-. best interests of
the orgraiiization, in defeat as well as
victory, at the \\‘ei-dnesday election.
they should retire as nominees.

Candidates were reminded that op-
posing nominecs were selected for
equal desirable q'.n.vlitie.s, and that they
must work together in important or-
ganization prdjects. According to
one speaker, there should be no divi-
sion beiiween winning and losing nom-
inees because each must assume
equally important duties next year.

Assembly Against War
To Be Decided On Today

A meeting of University deans at
10:30 o'clock this morning will de-
termine whether or not the University
will sponsor the third hour on Friday
as a protest against war.

The undergraduate. body awaits
with interest the decision which will
determine if they will be permitted to

against a common evil———war.

Favorable consideration of the plan
by the deans will result in immediate
appointment by Leonard Marks, presi-
dent of SFA, of a student committee
to work upon the. assembly arrange-
ments. The assemblv would probably
be held in _‘.lemoriz1.l hall, and a prom-
inent local speaker would be present-
ed.

Student sentiment has indicated
that the proposed assembly would
have a strong backing.

Spanish MUSIC

The ancient romanticism in modern
Sbain was shown in a talk on “Span-
ish music” by M. A. DeVitis, associate
professor of modern languages, at the
Spanish club meeting Friday. Mr.
DeVitis illustrated the trends of their

By Gulliver

The bored looking eagle who
spreads gilded wings above the tri-
bune of the City -Council chambers
peered down Friday on more colossal
intelligence quotients than he has
seen all year, as professors, Univer-
sity administrators, lawyers and leg-
islators——-to ignore a quorum of the
city’s newspaper fraternity——at1:end-
ed the first hearings or the special

Early indications were that the case
would be tried in the newspapers, as
reporters sent oft‘ hourly dispatches to
three city desks and a.pproxima.tely

excitement moved sad-t’a.c.ed \\x'altei'

Reasons Gifered
For I—F Rejection

Friedman Declares Election Rule
Penalizes Small Fraternities

Since the Council of 1-‘residents of
Social Fraternities voted 12-1 Tues-
day night to adopt a constitution mak-
ing itself into an Interl’raternitv Coun-
cil, Sidney Friedman, C36, Phi Ep-
silon Pi president, who voiced the
only negative ‘vote, has dis(:losed the
reasons behind his t'raternit_v's reject-
ing the constitution.

The new constitution. subnlittod by
a. committee under James Vl-'ills, C35,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, contains one
provision which is radically dilterent
from any previous interi'raternity gov-
erning body’.-ilaws. The I-.l’are system
of preferential ballot. will be used in
election of otflicers, with all fraternity
men on campus given the voting
franchise.

Friedman objected to this provision,
declaring that "it serves as a penalty
to those fraternities which are not
good rushers.” '

“In every other imittr-r the Council
is to be composed of equal constituen-
ties. Dues for all houses are the
same and votes in Council itseli’ carry
only equal weigiit.

“But.” he said, “under this set-up.
those houses with the larger mem-
berships will control what is gener-
ally considered the most iinportant
elen.em': in a Council which is other-
wise a body of equal fraternities.”

Elasterners Uphold Nationalization
As Plan To Out War Proﬁts

 

Debating to no decision at the Phi
Epsilon Pi fraternity house last Fri-
day, the New York university debat-
ing team contested with Frank Doer-
in.:;‘er, C36, and John Torre-nee, C35,
or‘ the University.

The New York speakers, Sanford
Collander and George Grief. up-
held the a1“-ﬁrniative of the national-
ization otf munitions manufacture
throngli international agreement. They
claimed that nationalism was the
most feasible method of eliminating-
the profit motive which they con-
tended had created many evils.

The University team showed how
(lifﬁcult and inefficient the plan for
nationalization would become, and
how dangerous inight be the placing
of munitions in the hands of the army
and navy. They advocated, instead,
the removal of all war-time proﬁts by

a 100 per cent tax on all proﬁts over
$10,000, -
James Boyle, (‘-35, was chairman.

Activities Outside Class Were
Responsible For Pressure,
Plaintiffs Declare

‘Cla s s es Unhampered’

Testimon_v by ousted instruc-
tors‘appca.riug before the Stats.-
committcc here was summed up
Saturday by Dr. Frederick Ii.
Beutel, who 1uain.tained that the
University needs a larger Static
appropriation, but that the grant
should only come after a reorgan-
.lzation. of tho .l%o-ard of ’l‘rustcc.<.

Under such. circumstances, D1-.
Beiitel said, the State can and
should pay for the completion ol:'
the Catliedral.

John \‘\7el)er, business ]11allag‘Cl‘
of. the University, was the only
University representative called
during the two-day hearings. lilo
testiﬁecl.—atter Dr. Beutel had
discussed the Stadiuni and the
University athl.et.ic policy, tllat
State funds have not been divert-
ed to athletic purposes during the
past nine years.

Classroom teachings were never
censored, ﬁrst witnesses in the legi:-.-
lative conunittees probe into Univer-
sity academic freedom have agreed.

Recessing Saturday at'ternoon until
they reconvene in City Council cham-
bers this week-end, the ﬁve-man group
under Eugene A. Caputo, alumnus-..
rests ai’ter two days of varied attacks-
on the University administration and
the industrial heads of the district.

A series of former instructors and
protessors, beginning with Dr. Colston
E. V\='a1'ne—-o11 the economics st.-.U_.“~.‘
from 1926 to I930-——-l*7re(lericl£  VVolr-
man—-graduate assistant in 1929, and
Dr, l‘-‘rederick K, l3entel——who taught
business law from 1 :35 to 1£l27—told
the St ate investigators of coal strike-x
political campaigns, civil liberties
ﬁghts and the campus Liberal club in-
ci-dent,

Among the statements of Dr.
W-arne, who is now professor of eco-
nomics at Aniherst college, was that
lilrnest T_ \\/‘ieir, head of the \‘v'eirton
Steel (:ox1ipai1y_ had written Chancel-
lor John G. Bowinan. to protest a.gainsz.
Dr. \Varne's “biased statements” con-
cerning mining conditions -during the
1927 strike.

“I was not permitted to write a ser-
ics of articles on the strike for a local
newspaper,” he said. At another
point he declared that, several hours
after he was “fired,” he was given his
1928—29 contract when he agreed not
to write or talk about the coal situa-
tion.

\Voltman, who was dismissed at't(-1'
the Liberal club episode in 1929, and
who now wrnies for the New Yorl»:
“VVorld-Telegram,” asserted that 20
University 1“aculty members haw
stories of suppression to tell, but “do
not dare” to reveal them.

The witness who had come liere
late Thursday from New York re-
viewed the events which led to the ex-
pulsion of two student Liberal club
members, the dissolutioii of the 0:"-
ganization, and his own dismissal. l.l.«i-.
charged that. both Dr. Lee Paul Sieg.
then dean of the Colle_:;;e, and J. Steele
Cow, then executive secretary of the
University, had told him that his pub-
lished stories on the coal and iron pc-
iice had angered Governor John S
l-."sher and had endangered the stat
appropriation.

D-r_ l3eutel——who began to testify
shortly before the session closed Fri-
day alftornoou——charged that he haul
been “blacklisted” by the University.
after he resigned “to avoid being
ﬁred.” l\'ow at Tulane university, he
is chairman of a National Bar Asso-
ciation committee.

His testimony in the 1926 “slush
fund” investigation, in which he
c.harge<l corruption in the senatoriz-ll.
and gubernatorial election of that
year, had “ruined his future at the.
University,"’ Dr. Beutel quoted Mr.
Gow. '

Proininc-ntl_v mentioned in the first
hearings were Andrew W’. Mell.on, Dr.
Hugh Thompson Kerr, both University
trustees; Dr_ Mont R. Gabbert, pro-
fessor and head of the department oi
philosophy; l)r. Elmer D. Graper.
professor and head of the department
of political science; Dr. Francis 1)
Tyson, professor of economics; am’.-
ll-r_ ’.-Vl.'1ric=n K. .\lcl{a_v, head of the
cconomics department.

Observers expect that faculty meni-
bers will be called to the stand after
the prosecuting group, represented by

ate protessor of history,

change, but their applications are in
constant metamorpliosis,” said Cap-
tain ‘Williams. .

The aviator told how he and his
younger officers pleaded with the ad-
mirals for the building of monoplanes
instead of biplanes during the war.
The young men had no basis for their
convictions except that of common
sense, and Captain V-Viliiains explained

their feelings by blurting out: “There
was never a biplane bird!”

Looking forward toward the ulti-
Jn:-itc in ﬂying, the speaker concluded:
“The most complete equipment will
not be merely an improvement in of-
ﬁciency, speed, or safety of the pros-
ent-day plane. I can see no completre
development except that where a per-
son merely tlirows something over his
shoulders and flies out awindow. This
may-sound fantastic, but to me it
seems the only logical ﬁnal conclu-
sion.” ‘

Editor, The Pitt News:

As students of the University and
thus interested in the nominations for
Senior Queen, we would like to know
on what basis these candidates are
chosen. It appears that pure politics
and partiality are the basis for this
year’s selection. There has been 21
singular omission which has caused
much comment and dissatisfaction on
campus.

We have in mind a girl who has
been active for four years in a variety
of activiiies. She has achieved more
than average success in every activity
in which she has p-.1.r?.icipated.

As a member of SFA, she has been
the sole woman chairman of a large
and responsible committee, as presi-
dent of YWCA she has been the guid-
ing hand of an organization that
comes in contact with every woman
on campus; as a Cwen and a Mortar
Board she has achieved prominenc-3
in honorary activities; as a conimittcc
member and as a person interested in
the affairs of the University. she has
sold tickets for countless University
dances; as a member of the Owl staff,
Pitt Players. a. participant in style
shows. C.ll£l.ll‘l'll2.'lTl of the Catlie-rlral Hos-
pitality Conimittee of the Catlieclml
Finaiice Ca1iiD8ign_ one of the origina-
tors of the Student Chest Drive, slize
has in her four years czirried her full
o,uo‘o of activity points. Ail tliese
activities, however, have not inlicrfer-
ed with her scholastic attainments.
Such a well-rounded campus life-—
touching as it does, religious, Social
and scholastic ﬁelds—marks her as a
woman who undoubtedly deservres
recognition for the liigliest honor llio
University can give.

A Dissertation,
‘The Happy Life I
0fA Poor Mani

By Edwin Banks

NE OF THE most evident manifes-

tations of modern capitalist so-
ciety is its creation of populous leisure
class. - In thisjgclass are two strikingly
distinct groups. The first, composed
of a very few, is glutted with means
for enjoying its leisure.
composed of a very many, is sever:-lg:
limited in the same respect; it has the
leisure; it has almost none of the
means" — —- - ~

With hardly an exception, we college
seniors who can scrape up enough
money to pay for our sheepskins in
June belong to the second group. We
will be leaving the halls of academic
learning and freedom to swell the
ranks of the millions who have plenty
of time on their hands and nothing in
their pockets. Unfortunately, Aineri-ca
at present has no economic program
such as the AAA to remove some of
the group so that the labor value of
the rest can-rise. Of course, fortu-
nately, prospects are favorable for
anotlier international slaughter short-
ly, in spite of the insidious activities
of certain trouble—making undergrad-
uates pretending to dislike being vic-
tims of the blll'.ClleI‘Y. Howevtr.
slaughter or no sla11gh.tei‘, this leisure
class will still be v-as .

The problem for us who _9‘_.l"c‘:.~£ll‘.9.t€
with the fact facing us that we cannor,
even hope for the pleas‘.1rc'oi‘ working
in sweatshops, is twofold. First. un-
less we are satisﬁed with much leisure
and little bread, we niiistliend our of-
forts to reshaping the political and
economic order which has brouglit us
where we are. And, second, we riust
learn to use our leisure  iiitelligently
and enjoyable as possible.

It is supposed to be platitudinous
that the deepest delights of life cuniioi;
be bought or sold, and there are still
rhapsodies on the pleasures of pover-
ty. Most of us, personally, are prob-
ably inclined to agree with B€l‘l121l‘(‘
Shaw that penury is decidedly obnoxi-
ous. On the other hand, if we are to
be poor and idle and if we cannot sup
press tlie will to live," we n~.i,9:‘nt as
well take serious stock of ourselves
and decide how to make our existence
not only endurable but pleasaiit._

To return to the platitude, like
most pla.titudes.it has enough truth
in it to -justify its use. iI_ove, friend-
ship (yes, dear reader), etc., etc., are
still not purchased with an old man’s
gold, etc.. etc. An intelligent curi-
osity about an intelligent syinpathy
for our fellow sufferers does not de-
pend on our economic position. An
-appreciation of the birds, the bees.
and the little nut trees can be devel-
oped considerably without the pay-
ment of an admission fee or a sales
tax.

About Sleep and Windows

Believe it or not. it doesu‘t insure
ventilation of a room to—

1--Open the window at the bot-
tom.

2———Open the window at the top.

3——-Open two windows at the top
or bottom on opposite sides of the
room. . -

These statements have been proved
by R. (3. Gorham, assistant professor
of electrical engineering, who built
up his own proof in the shape of a
small wooden box representing the
room.

in the box are four candles. One
side is of glass. Four holes are cut.
into another side and four on the op-
posite side.

Mr. (lorhani llglits the candles, then
by plugging the four lower holes
shows that ven1.il:itioii cannot be so-
cured by opening windows only from
the top.

The candles go out after a few min-
utes.

V‘.ll')7.lll§2,' the (tOllll)il1£ltlCI1_. he proves
that a small m_)ening at the top and
bottom of the box supplies more air
than larger openings just at the bot-
tom or top.

One opening at the top and miotlior
on the other side at the bottom also
lend to rapid veiitilation.

“NO LOAFING IN THE BARBER

no exception.” “Bible Class Wednes-

Such were the slogans which 55 Uni-
versity students saw at the Western
Pennsylvania. penitentiary Thursday.

The Huiiian Relations club group
was led by a guard through the audi-
torium and the athletic field, where
the blue-overalled convicts, looking
more like factory workers than pris-
oners, were spending a recreation pe-
riod.

Some were playing baseball, others
chess or dominoes. The rest “rested."

The students were shown the prison
kitchen and mess hall. I11-ainburger,
rice pudding and green peas——“140 gal-
lons of them” was the menu for that
evening, said the head chef.

The penitentiary, as it appeared to
the st‘-idents, was 21 sell‘-contziined coin-

Many For Distance Events

For the longer distances, Olson has
a host of material from which he
can draw. 'Wagenhouser, Kirkpatrick
and Bill Albright. all seniors, are in
the fold along with Sam Musico and
Red Test. This quintet of runners has
been in training since the beginning
of school last fall and contributed
largely to Pitt's successful cross-
country record. ~

The hurdle events will be taken
care of by Fleming. Good, Blair and
Sowiski. Good, Blair and Sowiski
will take care of the 120-high hurdles
and Fleming is u sure bet for the‘ 220-
iow hurdles.

‘Weight men are plentiful with Emil
llonavita, Pete Avezienis and Charley
Gongloﬁf heading the procession. This
trio will take care of the shot-put,
discus, hammer and javelin events.
Gongloff’s specialty is the javelin and
Bonavita and Avizienis will add many
points to the Panther‘ total in the
other events. Other ﬁeld performers
are I-I.’-mley, Fa.ssinger and Taano.

Cy Peluclta and Bill Johnson will
hold up their end in the pole vault.
Peluclia may add a new school mark
in his favorite event as he has reached
.3 feet, three intzhes in indoor com-
petition. Johnson is a consistent 12-
toot performer. Blair and Gerrety
are other vaulters.

Good, Fleming and Blair form the
nucleus for the broad jump material
Good will also be entered in the hop,
step and jump event any time that
event IS listed on a meet schedule.

If Olson could use a freshman, Ben-
nett. for varsity competition in the
high jump. he would have one less
worry. However, Blair is his best var-
sity bet in this event. Other jumpers
include Taano. Pelucha and Good.

Annual Handicaps Saturday

All these men mentioned will be
seen in action next Saturday after-
noon when the second annual Univer-
sity Handicap meet opens the outdoor
track season for the Panthers. In ad-
dition to the varsity, freshman ath-
letes will compete with the varsity in
the meet.

The meet is open to all University
students, any one can enter the meet
by signing the entry blank appearing
on this page.

Events on the program will include
the 100, 220 and 440-yard dashes, the
$80, one and two-mile runs, pole
vault, discus, high jump, broad jump,
shot put, javelin and hammer events.
Handicap ratings are given out ac-
cording to the entrant's ability, so
that novices have just as 800d 3-
chance of winning a race as have the
boys who will start out from scratch.

Varsity Netmen To-—Work
Out On Stadium Courts

VVith the stadium courts ready for
wear and tear, Coach Dave O’Lough-
lin’s tennis aspirants will begin the
battle for positions on the net squad
tot"-say.

The candidates have been putting
in practices hither and yon for the
past two weeks, getting into shape for
the tryouts. Five letternten back from
last season's ﬁne aggregation will
probably take care of ﬁve berths,
with Bob Madden, sophomore star,
getting the sixth place. The team
opens its season on Thursday after-
noon in Washington, D. C., meeting
George Washington university.

The probable lineup for this match
will be Robert Madden, Joe Madden,
Jim Slocum, James Thompson, Lloyd

Rain Can’t Stop
Spring G-ridders

Panthers Get First Opportunity
To Work On Wet Field

Thirzgs were pt‘(‘g;ressing' nicely for
Dr. Sutherland (l‘;Il'lIl;1‘ the spring foot-
ball drills until rain on Friday turned
the football aﬁeld into a cross be-
tween a duck pond and a grade A
marsh, thus slowing up the works
considerably. It was the ﬁrst time
tliat spring that the mudders had a
chance tc look good.

The previous two weeks of uninter-
rupted drills on a dry ﬁeld enabled
the backs to show to the best of their
ability. The coaching staff has been
handing out new plays as fast as the
players can perfect them. Particular
attention is being paid to the execu-
tion of the minor details of each play.
Everything has to come right up to
the doctor’s orders.

The battle is still on for
berths. None of the candidates have-
as yet conceded any positions-to com-
petitors. This is brought out by the
desire on the part of every candidate
to learn to do everything- well and
not pro_crastina.te at the more difﬂcult
tasks, meaning that each individual
feels as though he is going to be
counted on next season. ,

All-lntratnurul court team.

At the forwards are Captain Michel-
osen, leader of the Kappa Sig cham-
pionship five, and Middlemiss, of the
runner-up Chem Engineers. Both boys
are (gxcellellt ball handlers. Arnold
Green, bulky Panther signal bat‘ke1‘,
continued to play the same brand of
ball tliat earned him the title of out-
standing Greek perforiner in last
year’s interl‘rate1‘nity tourney. Green
led the play of both the Pre-Dent
and Psi Omega tourney entries, to
win the center position.

Med league, was outstanding in the
 Soph rise to».the tliirdplace po-
sition in the elimination tour.ne_v.,

Groat, Kappa Sigma’s star defensive
performer, at the guards.

The second string inythical lineup
shows Leonard. Chem Engineer,-and
Bob Gerretjr, Phi Omega, at the for-
wards. Don Hensley, Kappa Sigma,
gets the center assignment.

Lanute, Pre Dent, and Bob Mc-
Clure, Delt, earned guard berths on

ut. away for the summer, the Pitt
Panther ring season.

liy winning the 135-pound title and the runner-up position in

?the welterweight. class at the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference

boxing tournament at Morgantown, the Panther varsity boxers

at the Unive1‘sit_\'.

‘brought to a close another chapter in the history of the ring sport

In their ﬁrstseason under the tute-6
lage of Coach Jack Sclt1‘icke1', the Pitt

included some‘ of the best college
teams‘ in the coi1nl.r_v.

Out of seven matches the Panthers
won two, lost. four, and tied one. Vic-
tories were scored over Vvashington
and Jefferson and Temple, both by
4.-3 scores. The hook and jab artists
lost to Syracuse, :31,-gto 1%; to \Visco:n-
sin, 51/3 to 21/2; to Navy, 61/2 to ll/§;
to Vvest Virginia, 7-0, while the match
with ltliatni university of Florida re-
sulted in 21 31,43 to 31/3 draw.

The Pitt leather pusliers displayed
consistent improvement tltroughout
the season, and with three sophomores
back as a nucleus for next year’s team
a successful season appears to be in
order.

The outstanding performer of the
season was Captain Jimmy (iiaitttatti
who compiled an enviable record of
four wins and one draw in six starts.
Included among his victims was
George Stupar of Wisconsin, the do-
feat being the only one which the
Badge‘ liglttwe-igltt suffered in three
years of lntercollegiat.c- competition.

Giannatii suffered his only setback
when he was beaten by Vacheresse of
‘Nest ,Virginia., which defeat. he
avenged by scfot.‘ing a technical knock-
out over the Mountaineer in the semi-
ﬁnals of the Cont'erence champion-
ships. The Pitt captain brought to a
fitting climax a brilliant season by de-
{eating Conti of W'ashington and Jet'-
ierson in the ﬁnals of the ‘COlllZ'(-}l‘(3.1lCC—)
tournament for the 135—pound title.

The veteran. Panther welterweiglit,
Be:-tiie Spei,°.‘el_ was another consistent
winner, chalking up four victories and
one draw in his seven ﬁghts. Speigel
also competed in the eastern Intercol-
legiate tournament and succeeded in
winning the runner-up position in the
145-pound class. His two losses,
which occurred in the Navy and ‘Nest
Virgiitia. matches, were the result of
the referee’s decision, and in both

cases the fans believed the ve1‘dict
should have been reversed

Joe Kopp was the tough-luck boy of
the squad, dropping all four of his
bouts. Kopp was unable to report un-
til midseason due to scholastic dif-
ficulties, and was the victim of mis-
t‘ortune when he suffered a had cut;
over his eye in the Navy bout, being
thus handicapped for the remainder
of the year. .

Gene Stoughton, the fourth veteran
on the squad, is a junior with another
year of varsity competition ahead of
hint. Stottgltton competed in seven
bouts, winning two and dropping ﬁve.
His victories were scored over VViscon.-
sin and Temple opponents.

The three sophomore members of
the squad, Sivak. Paslowski. and
Dines enjoyed a fairly successful sea-
son in their first year of lntercolle§.ri-
ate competition. Paslowski, ﬁghting
in the 12:3-pound class, annexed th1‘ee
victories in seven starts. His four
losses were all decision a.ffairs_ while
two of his three wins were via the
tec-Iinicftl knockout; route. Sivak
scored his only victory in live attempts
in the \Vashington and Jefferson
match, winning by a technical knock-
out. Dines, Coach Schricker’s repre-
sentative in the 155-pound class,
broke into the victory column once in
six ﬁy-.:l.its by gaining a decision over

is opponent in the Temple match.

Students 0f1882,
1935 Compared In
Religious Survey

 

A religious survey compiled recent-
ly from records in the registrar's oi’-
ﬁce makes possible an interesting
comparison with one made 53 years
ago when the University of Pittsburgh
was still the Western University of
Pennsylvania.

In 1882 Presbyterians led other de-
nominations with 50 per cent of the
student body, while 1\'iethodist-Epis-
copalians ran a poor second with 15
per cent. Nine per cent were Episco-
palians, nine per cent Lutherans, nine
per cent United Presbyterians, five
per cent Baptists and three per cent
were listed as “Dis” (whatever that
meant).

Today of the 5,590 students, 3,013,
54.4 per cent of the student body, are
Protestants; 1,115, 20.2 per cent, are
Roman and Greek Catholics; and 708,
12.8 per cent, profess the Jewish faith.
Students who have not listed their re-
ligion numbered 534, 9.6 per cent, and
160 Others, 2.9 per cent, have no reli-
gious preference.

The records from 188:? were discov-
ered in 1933 by Professor L. C. Mc-
Candless, head of the department of
civil engineering, while he was delving
in some records of his department.

Panhellenic’s Career As A Force
Of Intercollegiate Unity Reviewed

 

Seven years ago, nine Universities
answered an invitation sent out by
the Panhellenic Council of the Univer-
sity to attend the first conference of
the Panhellenic Association of urban
schools. This year nine Universities
have again accepted an invitation to
take part in the eighth annual con-
ference of the Intercollegiate Asso-
ciation of Urban Universities.

The association was formed as the.
result of a long felt need for an in-
lei-college discussion of the individual
and peculiar problems of fraternities.

Seven of the original nine schools
will again participate in the confer-
ence. two of the original group hav-
ing dropped out of active participa-
tion and two others having enrolled
for the present assembly.

The Panhellenic Association of any
urban university is eligible to mem-
bership in the organization and may
become a member on a majority vote

of the member universities.

At. the meetixigs each year the prob-
lems of the fraternity group are intro-
duced and (list-ussed. the representa-
tivcs of each institution telling how
the problem is solved in her associa-
tion, and a general ruling and solu-
tion is. reached as a result of the
majority opinion of the group.

Muriel Dils, president of the local
Panbellenic Council, and Lois Milli-
ken, vice president, are ].resident and
s-c<_:rct.a1'y-treasurer respectively of
the iiationzil association.

Tlie seven original members, who
will attend this year, are the Univer-
sity of Akron, University of Buifalo,
University of Cinciiinati, George
Wasliington University, Hunter Col-
lege of New York. University of Min-
nesota and Ohio State University. The
newer members are the Universit,v of
Louisville and the University of Penn-
sylvauia,

Commandments

For Candidates

of thy fraternity in vain, for by
thine own ability must thou rule
and not by any pin or ritluai.

4. Thou shalt remember the day
of election to keep it holy, that by
no sudden interest in the welfare
of thy constituents or by any dis-
play of undue friendliness thou de-
gradest thyself or lowerest the dig-
nity of the office thouseekest.

5. Thou shalt honor thine oppo-
nent so that if thou art the success-
ful candidate thine opponent may
take joy in serving thee, and if thou
art defeated thou mayest have re-
spect for thyself in serving her.

6. Thou shalt! not commit mur-
der to anything fine that is within
thyself, but rather shalt thou grow
in dignity and self-respect through
thy conduct at this time.

7. Thou shalt not aduiterate the
purity of this election by bringing
into it any personal‘ feeling, any
prejudice, or anything that may ob-
scure thc real issue: to select offi.'
cers worthy to carry out the tradi-
tions and ideals of the university.

8. Thou shalt not by any act or
word steal even so much as a small
part of the reputation of thine op-
ponent or thy friend’s opponent.

9. Thou shalt not bear false wit-
ness as to what thou shalt accom-
plish if thou art elected, ‘but rather
shalt thou modestly and wisely
study thine organization and office
and outline to thyself the policies
that ‘.'hou wilt carry out should thou
be elected.

‘.0. Thou shalt not covet any
votes that are thine opponents, for
if constituents be lacking to thee,
no coveting on thy part may insure
success, but rather the act of covet-
ing will drive from thee the constit-
ents thou mayest already possess.

ings would deal with subjects more

closely connected with classroom
work.
An “exchange lleriod” on stated

days will feature programs of the
men's and Women’s -Cathedral lounges.
if present plans materialize, At such
times, it is said, the separate lounges
would be alternately open to both
men and women. The project will
thus replace the previous one of a
large combined social room on the
sixth ﬂoor.

More likely than a month ago are
provisions for a combined all-Univer-
sity handbook, to be distributed free
to all students in September. The
book, replacing the Women’s Vade
Mecum and the men’s YMCA publica-
tion, would be published under SFA
auspices.

A few days before May Tap day,
says Marks, the Executive body will
choose an outstanding junior man to
receive the traditional Senior Spoon
at the exercises.

June 3 has been tentatively set
aside for a senior men’s dinner, the
committee also has announced.
