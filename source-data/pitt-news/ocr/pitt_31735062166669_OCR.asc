Failure of the State Legis-
lature to pass Governor Ray-
mond Shafer’s budget, con-
taining non-preferred appro-
priations for the University,
by the Oct. 1 deadline, has
forced the University in-
to borrowing money to main-
tain its operational -costs. This
same dilemma faces both Tem-

.ple University and Penn State.

it was revealed Tuesday.

In -an attempt to ameliorate
this situation, President Paul
Anderson of Temple, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar of the Universi-

 

Financial Delay

ty, and President Eric Walker
of ‘Penn State sent a telegram
to Governor Shafer and legis-
lative leaders stating that the
ﬁnances of the three major state-
related universities, “depends
upon support from the Com-
monwealth and have reached an
alarming stage.”

The message also stated that
while the legislature procrastin-
ates, the interest on the loans
increas-e~s. The universities can
make no plan for the future, or
start academic projects which
have already been scheduled.

Dr. Posvar, in a message to
the student body, stated, “While
we can not realistically conceive
of a situation in which the legis-

lature would fail intimately to
pass our appropriation, we felt
it was important to point out
to the governor that the delay is
awkward, difficult and costly
for us. To meet our current op-
erating expenses, we must bor-
row large sums of money, the
interest on which is an unex-
pected drain on our. resources,
and we are inhibited in planning
for the future.

However, we do believe that
the situation, though serious is
temporary. As yet there is no
threat to our long-range aca-
demic programs. Rather, it was
to safeguard these programs
that we felt it necessary to
make our statement.

 

   

So while there is genuine
cause for concern, I hope the
student body will recognize the
present limits of that concern

In response to the pleas of

forced to endure. He added, "I

SG Passes By — Law
Revisions Providing
For Parliamentarian

by PAUL STOLLER
The Student Government (SG) Senate passed last night
their by-law revisions.

The revised by-laws call for the dismissal of any Sen-
ator who has missed three meetings in either the fall or
winter terms. They also provide for a parliamentarian who
shall be elected by two-t'hirds vote of the Senators present.

[The pa-rliamenta-rian provi-siron also states that the parliamen-
tarian shall have authority on questions‘ of order and procedure.
The parliament-arian will not ‘be a senator.

SG President Ken Frederick announced that he had spoken to
the Chancellor regarding the SG resolutions on both the tuition
reduction and the student union.

Frederick explained that the “University is behind the idea of a

a new student union.” We can
discuss the student union issue
in depth when the Student Union
Board (SUB) presents its re-
vised constitution to the SG rec-
ognitions committee.

‘Frederick also explained that
“there are ma-ny implications
which complicate a possible tui-
tion reduction.” He stressed the
fact that in the state bill the
University tuition is listed at
$1,450 a year and that the state
gives in-state residents an across
the board subsidiy. “A drop in
out-of-‘state tuition would neces-
sitate an overall tuition reduc-
tion. This,” stated Frederick.
“would bring about a loss of in-
come for the University.”

The Senate also approved two
presidential nominations. Mar-
jorie Kisilinsky was approved as
president of the Education Cab-
inet. The Senate also affirmed
the nomintion of Jeff Zdrale as
chairman of Winter Weekend.

The next SG meeting will be
held Oct. 25 at 7 p.m. in Dining

Schlesinger Sees Bombing
Threat To Viet Negotiations

by HOBART HARRIS
“The era of the superpowers has come to an end,” said Ar-

 

ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, JR.
Midday Speaker

thur Schlesinger, former special assistant to President Kennedy,
“and this has been recognized by everyone except the superpow-
ers.” Speaking before a packed Student Union audience Wednes-
day, Schlesinger presented the View that our involvement in Viet-
nam has been the result of our failure to understand the funda-
mental change in the power relaltio-nsihips of the world.

“The United States and the Soviet Union Working together,

could no longer control events in the .Middle East and South East » 

Asia. The rise of Nationalism h-as led to the growing oppo-sitilon
to‘ the United States in the West, growing opposition against Rus-
sia in the East, and growing ~oppos'iti-on against both in the un-
committed world.” ‘ V

With this as his basis of analysis, Schlesinger progressed to A 7
his views of the Vietnamese war. His ﬁrst point was that he felt

that recent history has shown that Nationalism has consistently

triumphed over Ideology when it

The William Pitt Debating
Union (WPDU) defeated the
challenging University of Colo-
orado team in its first fall debate,
Tuesday evening. The substan-
tial victory of 36 to 23 upheld
the WPDU’s oppos-ition to the
withdrawal of the United States
from Vietnam.

Appealing to the -house, who
were the voters in the debate,
Colorado tried to discredit the
three main reasons which they
cited for the intervention in Viet-
nam. The three reasons were:
(1) To support the self-deter-
mination of the South Vietna-
mese people against commun-
ism; (2) To end the threat of
communism in South Vietnam
and thereby discourage all wars
of national liberation; and (3)

To honor our commai-tment in
that country.

The Colorado team cited sta-
tistics which showed large num-
bers of South Vietnamese des-
sertions. They gave statistics
which bore the point that the
South Vietnamese people want-
ed peace at any cost, even if
this meant that Ho Chi Minh
would become their president.

The lack of military success
oven with escalation, and the
fact that a prestige lost would
not be signiﬁcant because of the
great power of the United States
were illustrated to discredit the
government's position. “We must
try something new,” ‘they con-
cluded.

The WPDU rebutted by stat-
ing that the South Vietnamese
dessertions were due to the
agrarian setting of the war. The
soldiers often return temp-orari-
ly to their farms, to come back
into battle at crucial periods.

In 1954, the WPDU continued,
when poles showed _that the
South Vietnamese people would
have accepted Ho Chi Minh as
president, he was a national.
hero who had ousted the Japa-
nese from that country. Further,
the team argued, withdrawing
of the United States would cause
an imbalance of power. Smaller
states such as Camlbodia’ and
Thailand would have to accom-
modate the large Communist
powers. So that while Vietnam
may not serve as a test case for

wars of national liberation
around the world, it certainly
does so with respect to South-
east Asia.

The only point of concession
which was agreed on by both
sides, was that the United States’
political rhetoric in itself does
not justify its stand on Vietnam
The University of Colorado, of
course, rejected it completely,
while the WPDU simply amend-
ed it.

that nations concern themselves

with. He used Red China as an , V I
example of this by pointing out
that at -the time that the Corn-

rnunists -seized power in China,
it was generally assumed, and
especially articulated by Dean
Rusk that China would become
a “Russian c.olo'n'ia-l govern-
ment.”

' t

This, as Schlesinger pointed .

out, could not be farther from
the truth. Rather than following
the “official” Russian line, the
Chinese have pursued a violent-

ly Nationalism form of govern- A

ment of their own. “The world

Communist movementtoday is g _”

in a stage of upheaval, turmoil,
and virtual civil war,” Schles-
inger pointed out, “it is abso-
lutely essential to understand

The evaluation covers 35 distribution courses numbered in the

80's. Data on each course, gathered on a standard questionnaire‘ . 

in class sessions last Winter, will be printed on separate pages.
Speigel indicated that the information is merely stated, not inter-
preted. The questionnaires covered such topics as instructor's in-
terest, enthusiasm, knowledge
of subject, and required work.
Ron Cohen, a member of the
Cabinet vwho has been working
closely on the evaluation, ex-
plained that the purpose of the
evaluation is to “produce a me-
dium through which students
can express their opinions albou.-t

tures.”

About 1,500 copies of the eval-

Several years ago Miss Uni-

very few of these actually know
what is being represented by
the various countries.

It seems that there. are prob-
lems as well as advantages in
connection with the rooms. Mrs.
Anderson, advisor to Quo Vadis,
remarked that “the Nationality
room committees and the host-
ess guides are disturbed about
the lack of care of the rooms.
The English room has just been
redone at a cost ‘of several thou-
sand dollars because of destruc-
tion by cigarette butts and sticky
coke cups.

The contents of these rooms
are valuable, and most of them
are irreplaceable. The Univer-

New Staff Member Reviews .
Counseling Center Services

by ANNE DORN

Enthusiastically discussing the
programs and responsibilities of
the University Counseling Serv-
ice, Dr. Thomas Schlesinger, the
most recent appointee to the
staff of four psychologists, ex-
plained that the center -is “pic-
neering, in the sen:se that we
have a wider range of things
that we do.”

Schlesinger indicated several
of the programs that -the center
sponsors in addition to the job
of couseling. One is the “Open
Circle,” a community service
group which also meets weekly
for “open-ended discussions.”
Another program which -includes
free discussion is the “Special
Fellowship Program,” headed by
Dr. George Letchw-orth. For this»
plan, faculty members recom-
mend students whom they feel
have “outstanding scholarly po-
tential.”

The ultimate goal of the pro-
gram is to encourage the stu-
dent to use their potential, stat-
cd Schlesinger. The participants
have the oppontunlity to apply
for special seholarshzips. Besides

this program, the center also

sponsors the Fulbright Fellow-

ship Program, o-f which Dr. Rob-
ert Gallagh-er is in charge.

Schlesinger emphasized that
the center acts as a “catalyst to
facilitate communication be-
tween members of the Universi-
ty community, -since we're not
aligned to any one group. The
University community is becom-
ing fragmented and specialized.
Therefore, many may feel a lack
of personal contact. Here, we
recognize that that is one of the
problems, and we help in what-
ever ways that seem appropri-
ate. Some personal contact is
necessary.”

A program that aids "in this
com»muni~caltion is the “Student-
Faculty Seminar.” Students and

faculty pl-an University-wide ac— ’

tivities, said Schlesinger. “Last
year, they organized three of
four workshops and panel dis-
cussions.

“Flexibility is the key -to what
we do,” pointed out Schlesinger,
“We avoid bureaucracy.” He
said that there .is not set pro-
cedure to follow when :a student
comes into the office to discuss
a problem. “We go beyond the
tradritional conception of a coun-
seling center. There are very

few other schools, in my experi-
ence, that have such «a pro-
gram.”

A “discussion in depth’? with
3 Derson who shares the stu-
dents’ problems and perspec-
tives is an aim of the Center,
-stated Schlesinger. The student
talks in an “informal, relaxed at-
mosphere about a wide range of
Droblems — parents, peers, the
opposite sex, his vocation and
the future.” As a student, one
may go to the Center for any
reason if he wants” to talk and
be assured of talking in confi-
dence.”

Schlesinger assumed his posi-
tion as counselor July 1 of this
year. Previously, ‘he taught coun-
s-elor education at the Universi-
ty for three years. He grad-
uated from Wesleyan Universi-
ty with a ‘bachelor’s degree. in
psychology, and took his doc-
torate in counseling at the Uni-
versity of Mass-achusetts. '

Now, ‘he sees a “god cross-«sec
tion of students and believes
that “through talking with them,
we get to know them. Both of
us pro-ﬁt from this experience.”

this issue.

Up Until recently, as with
most members of the 50-
called “Establishment,” I
associated marijuana with
clandestine pot parties,
long-haired, beaded hippies,
and the left-wing revolu-
tionaries. Smoking mari-
juana was against the law,
and I did not much care for
 the type of ‘ people that went
 in for “acid,” “reef'ers” and

'27
,,.

. the like. My opinion on
“acidheads,” beaded hippies,
 and revolutionaries has not
 changed, but my thoughts
about marijuana have.

I attended a Conference
on Drugs at Frostburg Col-
lege in Maryland last week-
end, and in all the speeches,
 and discussions I listened
 teases 9t1einsta.tsd..a..§,t.r9.Iig
 reason as to why marijuana

cal doctor suggested that
 I prolonged and excessive use
 ‘of marijuana may cause se-
 vere physical harm. Of’
 course, prolonged and ex-
 cessive use of alcohol, may

» cause cirrhosis of the liver
and brain damage, and cig-
arette moking may cause
cancer. One may retort that

- maybe these should be il-
 legal too. If I remember
correctly, the United States

, tried making alcohol ille-

 justified in saying, then,
I that marijuana is illegal be-
cause a small minority of
people smoke “pot” and,
therefore, the law prohibit-
ing it is more enforceable?

that although marijuana is

Editorial: A Losing Game

Legisiators inform us that the Governor is not short one or two
votes on the major appropriations; rather, it is more like 10 or 15 votes.
'l‘his signifies that a.good percentage of Republicans are dissenting from
Shafer’s request. 0

The latest action of the State Attorney General, ruling that the ma-
jority is now 25 in the Senate due to the two vacancies, rather than the
heretofore majority of 26, has further angered the Democrats to think
not along the lines of conciliation, but about legal action that could be
taken to dispute the Attorney General’s ruling.

All of these incidents cited point out the poor performance by our
elected officials in Harrisburg. We do not know who is to blame and
could only guess. We do know however that there is no excuse for the
people of this Commonwealth to be subject to the debacle in Harrisburg.

We urge Governor Shafer to stop castigating the Democrats and
exert the leadership role entrusted to him by the people of Pennsylvania.
No one can come out ahead in the game our state leaders are currently
playing. Why don’t they accept that fact and do the work assigned to

The legislative stalemate on appropriations continues’ in Harris-
burg, with little hope for an agreemlent in the near future. Earlier this
week the piesidents of the three state-related universities sent a telegram
‘explaining their financial plight to Governor Shafer to the effect that their
A “fiancial problems have reached an alarming stage.” They informed the
Governor that they are “unable to plan for the future or to start present-
ly scheduled academic projects” due to the failure of the state to pass

What was Governor Shafer’s reply? ‘‘I would particularly hope that
the Democratic members who have been following their.party’s policy of
obstructionism to your revenue needs pay particular attention to the facts

Democratic leaders counter Shafer’s remarks, emphasizing that the
‘entire issue could have been settled several weeks ago if it were not for
the (.+overnc"’s adamacy on receiving all of his requested approplliations.
Informed sources reveal that Republican leaders are also distaught with
the Governors course of action, feeling that he has severely mishandled

es no harmful physical ef-
fects, he feels that people
who find it necessary to
smoke pot have some seri-
ous adjustment or person-
ality problem. He went on
to say that normalcy is “the
ability to work and love in
the society we live in.”
There is no proof that mari-
juana. smoking precludes
loving and working in so-
ciety today.

I maintain that with the
information I have read
and heard, I still remain un-
convinced that the state and
federal government have the
right to classify marijuana
smoking as illegal.

The legal authorities I
heard _$P_§_a.k .at the. confer-
ence maintained‘ that the
reason that the United
States has had relatively
few bad experiences with
its marijuana smokers is
that police control has made
the contraband marijuana
here mixed, and with low
potency, as compared with
the strong hashish of the
East. This is a valid argu-
ment, and I can see that
marijuana cannot be made
readily available to anyone
who wants to purchase it.
However, marijuana con-
trol can be handled much
the same way as alcohol is
handled, with an age limit,
a high state and federal tax,
and strict enforcement of
sale and purchase rules.

One can say that this
would create the same prob-
lem, that already exists
with minors: trying to use
false identification and the

like to purchase alcohol.
This is, of course, true, but
would the control of mari-
juana by the state in this
manner be any more diffi-
cult than controlling it as
an illegal “narcotic”?

These newly formed opin-
ions of mine concerning
marijuana would more than
likely have remained unex-
pressed if‘ it had not been
for a recent. item in the news
which disturbed me greatly.
A California school princi-
pal submitted an affidavit
to the California courts
stating that she had been
a daily user of marijuana
for a considerable number
of years. She did this in
support of the current fight
to legalize marijuana in
California. She was imme-
diately fired from her posi-
tion on the grounds of im-
moral behavior. Of course,
her so called “immoral” be-
havior had never manifest-
ed itself until she spoke up.
She said she used marijuana
each day before she retired,
or after a hard day in order
to relax. If she had said she
drank three martinis before
retiring, nothing would have
been said.

It took courage for this
woman to speak up, and try
to change a law in which
she did not believe. Admit-
tedly, she was wrong for
breaking the law for many
years before trying to
change it, but, nonetheless,
her expulsion from her job
for voicing her opinion in a
country which prides itself
on its “freedom and justice
for all,” and its “freedom
of speech,” seems to me a

 ‘_ if gross. prostitution of her

Whether a person drinks,

matter as long as he neither
infringes on anothers rights,
nor becomes a societal dan-

Who in the University would
write an editorial against stu-

on Wednesdays? A

A freshman might. Hoping to
impress his friends at home or
his new acquaintances in the
dorm, a freshman may write
such an editorial. He may want
to please his parents. Or this
may «be one way to have a sym-
boll of individuality for one face
in a crowd of 2,000 freshmen.

One of those athletic boys
with ‘short hair and an empty
head might. "Maylbe his girl-
friend is a member of Student
Government. Someone who
wants to walk around campus
with an air of self-nighteous-
nes-s maight.

A confused person might write
such an editorial. Confused be-
cause to write such an ediitorial
supposedly shows that one is
concerned. On the other hand,
the editorial is against United
States Withdrawal from Viet-
nam. These are two entirely dif-
ferent things.

Subtract all these and you
have a few young men and
women who have, after -many
-hours of deep thought and study,
sincerely come to =the conclusion
that they are opposed to United
States withdrawal from Viet-
nam.

These few are against a color
symbo1—-against the symbol to
peace. For after you take away
the nice phnases such as “anti-
communis " and “making the
world safe for democracy,” this
is what the war is‘ against --
peace.

Certainly, every thinking
American is concerned about the
war, but only a few University
students wri-te editoriials against
a symbol of peace.

THE NEW MURAL in Schenley Cafeteria spells out the University in abstract art.

I  IMural on Cafeteria VVall I

by SHERYLL ZIPPAY
When plans to remodel the
Schenley Cafeteria were ﬁrst
conceived, no one knew just

. exactly what was wanted.

Of necessity, the project to
paint part of the room had
to be something simple, prefer-
asbly using the letters spelling
“The University of Pilttsburgh”
in some way.

Paul Planert Design Associ-
ates, an -interior designing ﬁrm
in Oakland, received the task of
trans.ﬁormin.g the first wall of
the cafeteria. Helen Worsing, a
free la-nce commercial artist
whose work was already known
to members of the ﬁrm, was
commissioned to create a suit-
able design. Mrs. Worsing is a
memlber -of Associated Artists.
and has worked at the Gateway
Studios in downtown Pittsburgh.
Some of her work also appeared
in the Three Rivers Arts Festi-
val.

Mrs. Worsing decided that she
wanted “to create something ab-
stract; something that would
keep students looking at the de-
si-gn."sign.” The design evolved
from simple letters to conceal--
ment of the letters from casual
observation. “Using the letters
ofthe University seemed like a
good way to tie the school with
the mural. I enjoy working with
letters of the alphabet, but the
very’ size of the project makes
any chosen theme hard to satis-
fy’ everyone.”

At first the mural was de-
signed in full color, involving a
range of 20 to 30 colors. How-
ever simple color were ﬁnally
selected because of budget al-
lowances and also for their bold
design value.

It took approximately 40 work-
ing hours for Mrs. Worsing to
complete her composition of
lines and shapes. The Paul Plan
ert ﬁrm was “highly pleased
with what she did,” and her
plans were accepted by Univer
sity officials the ﬂrst time they
were submitted for approval.
The next step was for the Pitts-
-burgh Outdoor Advertising Com-
pany to paint the mural on the
cafeteria wall. (They completed
the 6x122 foot mural in less
than a week.

When Mrs. Worsing got a
chance to view her ﬁnished fun.
scalle mural, she observed, “It
has deﬁnitely improved the cafe-

teria. I’m impressed because it
really adds a lot of color. There s
something grim about institu-
tional yellow and green.”
Just how do the University
students feel about the mural?
According to one girl, “It be
longs in an art gallery or on a
banner for a football game ra
ther than in a cafeteria where
people try to eat.” Some other
observers described it as “gau-
dy,” “a bingo card,” “an Indian
teepee design,” and an “over-
compensation for drab walls.”

 1 Schenley Has New   Look

The majority of students, how-
ever, liked the mural in at least
a passive way, mostly citing its
colorfulness and uniqueness as
advantages. One student went
so far as to say, “It sure beats
the Towers!”

Even though the mural has
been open to public scrutiny for
overa month, a lot of students
have yet to decipher the letters.
One evidently deep thinker sum-
moned his critical powers of ob-
servation and remarked, “I nev-
er pay any attention to it.”

newspaper at Wayne ‘State University, quoted an anonymous mem-
ber of NSA’s Nation-arl Supervisory Board as saying that NSA
cancelled plans for a “dump Johnson” movement and an anti-war
march in Washington, because OE0 threatened to cut off funds
which it had granted to NSA.

Officials -of both NSA and -OEO denied the story, as did the
girl the South End said it was quoting.

NSA President Ed Schwartz called the charges a “pack of lies”
and Jim Williams of 01305 Office of Public Affairs issued a “cate-
gorical denial” that OEO pressured NSA.

According to the South End, the anonymous NSB member said
that the board held a secret meeting at which Schwartz said that
0E0 had threatened to take away financial support of NSA if it
went through with the plans for dump Johnson activity and anti-
war march.

" 'I'-he NSB then agreed, according to the story, and the day be-
fore the march was scheduled it was cancelled. The dump Johnson
effort, known ‘as ACT ’68, has since fizzled from a national effort

HAPPINESS IS LLOYD WESTON
John Rosenberg quietly whispered “blitz” into Lloyd
Weston’s ear. Rosenberg, a graduate assistant to freshman
coach Darrell Lewis, took a few steps back and watched
Weston go to work.

The freshmen were simulating the Wisconsin defense
for the Panther offense. Lloyd described what happened
after he received his instructions.

“I danced around along the line,” he grinned. “I knew
they weren’t expecting me to do anything. Well, they acted
real surprised when I got the quarterback.

“SO WE’RE LIN ING UP for the next play he chuckled,”
and coach Rosenberg comes up and whispers “do it again,
Lloyd,” so I blitz in there and get’em again. By now, the
offensive coach is wondering how I’m getting through. So
he yells at me to keep coming, and I blitz until they find
out how to stop it.”

'\ Lloyd had help on those sequences. Rosenberg had act-

'ual],y all three linebackers shooting the gap, but it was Lloyd
who got the passer and it was Lloyd and Ralph Cindrich
who got the ballcarrier. _

THE FRESHMEN ARE UP. They're cocky but confi-
dent. The freshmen know what it is to win. The varsity
doesn’t.

The varsity offense isn’t confident. The offensive line
has practiced and played without their regular coach,
Howard Weyers. The Panther quarterbacks had adequate
pass protection only three times against West Virginia. The
circle become-s vicious as the offense subconsciously loses
confidence {in the sophomore quarterbacks.

But everyone is going to have to forget the past weeks
tomorrow. Wisconsin is the last solid shot the Panthers have
at a victory. The Badgers haven’t won either. A win over
them might make a difference for the six tough games that
lie ahead. ..

WISCONSIN IS SIMILAR to the Panthers in many

 "ways. Their defense lists six seniors as starters while their

offense has only one. Their offense boasts of great receivers,
including one, Tom McCauley who is considered the best
in the Big_ 10.. But, their offensive line has not given the
quarterbacks time to throw. As a result, the Badgers lose
ballgames.

Defensively, Wisconsin has spirit just as the Panther
defense does. Linebacker Ken Criter and tackle Tom Dom-
-bres are entitled to Wear black helmets during practice and
during each. game for their savage play.

ONLY MENTAL ERRORS in the defensive secondary
allowed Arizona State and Michigan State to run up the
score. The Panthers at least don’t have that worry.

But the gridders do worry about mistakes on_ offense.
And the only thing that’s going to cure the indecisiveness

pp»:-ind the lack of confidence is a quick score. Dave Hart has

been leary to pass on first down early in the game because
as he says, “if it's incomplete then we’re second and ten
right away.” _ _ _ _

But if he’s going to come home with his first win,
Hart's going to have to hit Wisconsin with what they.won’t
be expecting: first down passes to Bob Longo. Hart himself
is going to have to show faith in his quarterback.

He should ask Weston about true confidence. “Penn
State next week ?,” asks Lloyd. “Good gosh, we’ll kill ‘em.”

“Moustachio” Makes

Panthers

 

by GEORGE LIES

Dave Hart doesn’t offer
excuses for being the Pan-
ther coach with the worst
record (1-12) ever, but he wish-
es his players would shake off
that losing attitude tomorrow
when they face Wisconsin in
Cha-mpaign. Game time is 2:30
p.m. (EDT).

Barring even a scoreless tie,
not an improbability with these
two offenses, either the Pan-
thers or the Badgers will win
their first game of the year. In
33 games since 1964, Wisconsin
has won eight; the Panthers
seven.

Nevertheless, a fellow named
Bob Longo could reverse the
Panthers’ losing ways. Tomor-
row he goes after another school
record. He needs only two more
pass receptions to break Mick-
ey Ros:borough’s career mark
of 78.

Longo already holds three
other school marks: most recep-
tions one game, 11; most total
yardage one season, 732; and
most receptions one season, 46.

With a winning football team
Longo would be a possible All-
Amerioan. On the Panthers.
however, he’s not given the
chance to display his talent.

This year, Longo had to bear

,v;?it-h Ha-rt’s rebuilding program
and three sorphornore quarter
backs. He went along with
H-alrt’s plea, “don’t get on the
quarterbacks, Bob; let me do
that.” And he has been one of
the leaders on -a team which
needs leaders.

It has been that problem of
leadership which has hurt the
offensive line, too. Making ad-
justments this week, Hart may
have hit upon a new leader, Tom
Mifrakos. ~

In practice, the seni-or letter-
inan settles the Jungle Cats’ two
guards, Ray Radakovrieh and
Art Al-ois. He talks to them, ad-
vising them not to complain
when a coach bellows, “N 0, no,
that's wrong.”

An offensive center last sea-
son, he started at tackle to give
the Cats added blocking strength
in the line. An injury to soph
Dave Magyar forced. Mitrakos’
return to center. Hewas named
to N otre Dame’-s all opponent
team, last year.

The absense of offensive line
coach Howard Weyers has had
“bad effects,”. remarked Hart.
Weyers, who is recuperating
from an infected prostrate gland,
visited practice Wednesday.

With the hardest part of the
schedule ahead after tomorrow,
Hart needs all the leaders he

can get; he must face up to a
morale problem. A losing atti-
tude is not good.

“Once you’re a loser,” said
Hart, Tuesday afternoon. “You
get panicky; you shoot a scared
stick. *

“It’s a good thing to taste vic-

Itory. But right now there is a

Stigma going against us,” con-
tinued Hart. “Maybe if We-would
have gotten on the board against
Illinois, we might’ve gotten out
of it.”

In practice this week, ‘Hart
may have achieved his wish. He
witnessed spirited practices. “I
was ‘pleased and it made my
heart warm to see these young
come back and lift themselves.”

When a coach wins only one
of his ﬁrs t 13 games, any
amount of hope -hellps. “I never
wanted to say last year t-hat
maybe we’re not as good as I
thought,” Hart said.

“That gets to be sour grapes
after awhile and nobody wants
to hear it.

“When you get into a situa
tion like this, you wonder how
you failed,” gestured Hart, who
must know ‘how many people
-are disappointed in the Pan
thers this year.

Play Hosts

To Rockets  

Having ﬁnally scored their
ﬁrst goal of the season against
Ohio" U. last Saturday, the var-
sirty boortens go after their ﬁrst
win of the year when they host
Slippery Rock tomorrow at
Forbes Field. Game time  1:30
p.m.

“It felt good to me to score,
and I know it felt good to the
players,” sai-d head coach Leo
B-emis. “We're starting to move‘
offensively. We’re moving Well
around the goal.”

Actually, Bemis felt that the ‘

so-ccermeli’ should have beaten
Ohio. A missed penalty kick led
to a 1-1 tie. Pete Snyder contri-
buted the bootens’ only goal.

However, the team may not
be at full strength. Joe Kruth,
described by goalie Len Harmon
as “the best fullback I’ve ever
seen,” suffered a concussion
against Ohio and didn’t practice
until Wednesday. The team’s
strength so far has been its
defense, and Kruth is the back-
bone of that defense at center
fullback.

Bemis has several alternatives
if Krulth is out, «al:t'h~ou.gh he is
conﬁdent Joe will be in tomor-
row’s lineup. Dave Koziell has
played very well on the second
team and might move up, or
Norm Roux might shift from
outside fullback to the middle,
with Bruce Searfoss or Wayne
Kaiser «starting on the ﬂank.
Also, sophomore rhlallﬂback Ron
Mielecki might ﬁnd himself in
the center, Where he starred in
high school.

At any rate, as Bemis said,
“The team will probably oper-
ate pretty much the same.”

The same may not . be good
enough to beat Slippery Rock.
Last year the Rockets won 3-2
for their first victory over the
varsity in 13 years.

“Tlhey had a winning season
last year and a lot of momen-
tum going into this year,” ana-
lyzed Bemis. “Also, they didn’t
«lose too many «players.

“Last year they beat us for
the first time,” he added. “They
did it last year, but they wont
do it again. We hope to put an-
other string of victories togeth-
er starting tomorrow.”

The coach pointed out that a
number of the players on each
-team faced each other in high

Q-

Victim of Win Streak

.by ART ROSENGARTEN
With the toughest part of the season ahead of them,
the varsity cross-county team travels to Grove City to-

morrow afternoon to face the strong Wolverine team.
Coach Jim BIanner’s distancernen are really up for the upcom-

ing meetings. Looking past Sat-
urday, they will face West Vir-
ginia, Penn State, and partici-
gﬁ.-;!§§  pate i-n theCa.n-
nisus Invita-
tional and ﬁ-
nally the IC4A
tournament.
The harriers
will be facing
their strongest
 ‘competition of
the season in
these meets.

Paul Greig
So far this season, the run-
ners have been doing fairly well
individually, but they haven't
too -hard by 3,

been pushed
their opposi-
tion. They have
a solid back-
ground of plen-
ty of distance 
work and they '
are now begin-
ning to concen- 0
trate o-n their -  .
speed work. Ken Lawton
Twice a week, Banner takes
the distancemen up to the stadi-
um where they run half mile
and mile distance at top speed.
The time gap between the ﬁrst
and ﬁfth men still exists, but it
is slowly closing. All of the har-
riers’ times have been improv-
ing as the season progresses.
Banner’s -philosophy is that
the slower you round into shape,
the better it is for the boy and

‘his times. He hopes that his

squad will reach their peak with-
in the next few weeks, especial-
ly by the time they .-travel to
New York’s Van Cortland Park
whe-re they  face some of
the ﬁnest teams in the East in
the IC4A’s.

Harrier Paul Zink has noth-
ing but praise for his t-eam-
mates. “Paul (-Greig) seems very
determined to -have -a. good sea-
son and so far this determina-
tion seems to be pay off,” he
said. Greig has captured ﬁrst

place in the varsity’s four vic-
tories and was the ﬁrst varsity
harrier to place in the triangu-
lar meet with Kent State and
Ohio University. “Greig-s a very
strong runner, and he is at his
best -on the ‘hills where he us-
ually pulls away from his corn-
petition,” said Zink.

“Ken Lawton has come along
quite well this season. He is in
e;-::ellent shape and -shows a
strong potential for the rest of
this season and the upcoming
track season,” praises Zink.

J-ay Jensen and Zink have also
run well in the past ‘meets. Zink
started off slowly this season
due to illness, but -he expects to
be up with Greig soon. Zink
feels that his roommate Jansen,
who is not Ia -class -runner but
more of -at guts runner, has
proved to ‘be a real plugger and
a -boost to the spirit and drive
of the team.

The extremely «strong fresh-
man teaim wi']l probably not run
Saturday due to lack of com-
pe-tition. The Wolverines do not
have a freshman team as -such,
since many of their freshmen
run ‘for the varsity. The big
meets that loom ahead for the
fro-sh are ‘a tough Penn State
team and the IC4A, where Ban-

ner expects ﬁne performances.

Freshmen basketball tryouts
will be held Sunday, Oct. 15,
and Monday, Oct. 16, at Trees
Hall, according to fr0sh_,coach
Tim Grgurich. Any freshmen
interested in trying out should
contact Grgurich at 683-2800,
ext. 236, for further details.
Freshman managers are also
needed.Possible applicants can
reach Grgurich at the same

number.

‘ Harriers Hope To Add WISCONSIN FOCUS

G1‘0V€ cits’ AS Fourth Badgers Have Horses To
But Line Chains Them

by MIKE BROURMAN

Wisconsin, claimed many
of the pre-season polls, was
the darkhorse in a hectic Big
Ten race. But -if the Badgers
are a threat they are certainly
taking their time proving it.
Wisconsin -has started its sea-
son in the -same manner that
Silky Sullivan began a race»-
far behind the ﬁeld.

New coach John Coatta in-
herited a nucleus of 26 letter
men and a ﬁne crop of sopho-
mores in his effort to give the
Badgers their ﬁrst winning sea-
-son in four years. Thus far his
efforts h-ave been unsuccessful,
and Wisconsin enters the -game
with the same 0-3 mark as the
Panthers.

VV:isconsin uses the pro-set of-
fense complete with a ﬂanker
and split end. “I honestly feel
that in order for us to be effec-
tive offensively, we have to use
this pro-type offense,” Coatta
commented. ‘‘We’re not going to
overpower many people, so we’re
going to spread them. We have
the personnel who lend them-
selves to tliis offensive se .”

The personnel Coatta refers
to includes three ﬁne quarter-
backs and a brace of good re-

ceivers. “John Ryan is one of’

the finest quarterbacks we'll see
all year,” noted Panther scout
Stan Zajdel. “He likes to run
more than throw but he does
both very well.”

Ryan will probably start for

the Badgers. Last week against,

Michigan State he accounted for
241 of Wisconsin’s 295 yards to-
tal offense. If he falters, Coatta
can call on John Boyaji-an, who
shared the signal-calling duties
with Ryan last year, or Chuck
Bart. Burt was one of the na-
tion's leading passers. in 1965
but was injured all last year
and hasn't -been able to regain
his job.

Coatta is extremely pleased
with his ends. “Receiving is the
strength of our team,” he said.
“Tom McCauley, Bill Fritz, Mel
Reddick, Bill -Yxankos -and Lew
Ritchenson. are all top-flight re-
ceivens. All the quarterbacks
have to do is get them the ball.”

Last year the passers got the
ball to McCauley 46 times, only
one reception less than the Bad-
ger record set by Pat Richter.

_’ This year McCauley grabbed off
- 14 passes in the ﬁrst two games,

then missed -the Michigan State
game with a leg injury. The
speedy ﬂanker will return to
face the Panthers.

Tight end Bill Fritz is des-
cribed as a “Mike Ditka-type” by
his coach, while Reddick, a
sophomore who has caught eight
pa-sses, is already being tagged
as a future All-American.

Still, the passing attack has
not been. enough. “Our problem
has been in providing protection
for the passer from the offen-
sive line,” Coatta noted. 'I“he line
should have an easier time with
the Panther rush than it has
had so far. ‘

Guard Wally Schoessow is the
only lettei-man in the front ﬁve,
but the line does have good size,
averaging 222, and tackle Brandt
Jackson was a. junior college

A ll-American.

tion except middle guard, where
soph Len Fields ‘holds sway.

When he goes after the all
time Panther receiving record,
Bob Longo will -be operating
against a veteran defensive sec-
ondary. Three of last year’s
starters are back including Tom
Schinke, a potential All-Ameri-

on punt and kickoff returns as

hit on eight in -11 tries.

In an effort to install more
aggressiveness in his defensive
unit. Coatta has issued two of
his players black helmets. These
headhunters have a “license to
kill” from their coach. If they
lose to the Panthers, there will
be more than two Badgers wear-
ing black.

Phi Ep, Kappa Sig Win; Sutherland
Play for League Titles VVinsDorm

by ED CONLEY

Fraternity softball has come down to the final cham-
pionship games. In League “A”, the two teams still in the
running are Phi Epsilon Pi and Pi Lambda Phi. Kappa Sigma
and Pi Kappa Alpha are the only survivors in League “B.”

In League “A,” Phi Ep got into the championship game with
two wins earlier this week. On Tuesday, Phi Ep eliminated Zeta
Beta Tau, with a 6-1 victory, and on Wednesday they ‘beat their op-

ponents for the championship
game, Pi Lam, 4-2.’

In the ZBT game, Phi Ep used
Bob Black's pi-tchin g, Andy
S.wartz’s hitting, and good ﬁeld-
ing in gaining t-he victory. Des-
pite the great ﬁelding, it was an
error that gave the losers their
only run.

Phi Ep’s win over Pi Lam, in
revenge of an earlier defeat,
came with Bob Black again hurl-
ing for the victory. Stan Leder-
man’s two-run home run in the
ﬁfth inning gave Phi Ep a 4-0

. lead; one they never lost. Dou-

bles by Chuck Green and Mark
Oklin gave Pi Lam its only runs.

League “B” followed the same
pattern as “A,” with Kappa Sig
beating previously undefeated
Pi Kap, earlier in the week.
Thus, the two teams must meet
one more time to determine the
champion. They beat Pi Kap,
1.1-7, after trouncing Sigma Al-
plha Epsilon, 13-3, on Tuesday.

The Victory -over SAE was
lead by Larry Lesnak’s six-hit
ter. John Briston and Mark Zov-
k-o hit home runs for the win-
ners. SAE’s weak ﬁelding also
contributed to ‘their defeat.

In the big Win over Phi Kap,
Larry Lesniak again was the
winning pitcher. Joe Diedrick
hit a home run for the winners,
as they had the game in their
command after jumping oﬁ to

V :31 Chuck 10-0 lead.

E'd2'tor’s Note: Fraternity A
and league championships were
played yesterday. Results wll be
printed in Mondaz/’s Pitt News.

Loop Title

by CHARLES DWORAK

A seVenth—inning grand-
slam homer by Frank Rus-
cetti carried Sutherland to
an 11-10 win over Playboy's
Penthouse for the Dorm League
Softball championship. Mad
House socked Random, 12-7, in
the consolation game to ﬁnish
third.

Sutherland, behind 10-6 going
into the ﬁanl inning, scored with
no one out on successive singles
by Bob Hanje, John Pierce, Jack
Ahrens, and Steve Ellisor. Rus
ce-tti then unloaded his homer
to left ﬁeld. Pierce had -two other
hits besi-des his seventhiinning
single, and Ahrens had a hit in
the third to drive in two of Su-
-ther1and’s three runs in that
inning.

Larry Illion collected two hits,
and Mike Star had three hits
for {the Playboys, ‘ who scored
four runs in the third inning,
and three times each in the
ﬁfth and sixth frames.

The game was marked by a
near-brawl which erupted at
home plate in Sutherland’s half
of the ﬁfth inning when the
plate umpire called a. runner out
at home with the Playboys lead-
ing, 7-6. Both teams also ex-
changed catcalls throughout the
contest.

Mad House scored ﬁve runs
in the fourth inning to hand
John Cavaluchy his ﬁrst loss in
ﬁve decisions for Random. Den

. nis Lockhard belted a three-run

homer and Fred Colossimo hom-
ered with no one on in the Mad-
m-en’s big inning. Colossimo had
two other hits and scored twice,
and Pete Neglio had three hits
in four times up. Winning pitch-
er Mark Anatole had tWo hits
and scored three times.

Ultimatum to ,“Fla.tbush:” Win

Or Watch Out For ‘The Boys’ , ,

The letter came addressed in
red crayon, which positively
marked it as from Broo-klyn. It
was addressed only “‘Flat-‘bush’
De Bum” but the ever—alert pos-
tal department speeded it im-
mediately to Yogi sage Jay “Flat-
bush Rosenstein.

The letter was short but served
to curdle “Flatbush’s” blood.
"Ya bum,” it read. “Yu’s a dis-
krace to da city of Brooklyn.
Iffin we don’t see some good
picks soon, a couple of da boys’ll
pay you a visit.”

“Fla-tbuslh” was not the only
Yogi running scared. Linda “Beu
lah” Goldstein was caught cheat-

for Seniors and Graduates in

CHEMICAL,
MECHANICAL,
ELECTRICAL,

and INDUSTRIAL
ENGINEERING

“Moustacio” Lies was angered.
“Linda is a big cheat,” bawled
the “Moustache,” jumping up
and down in a tantrum.

But, the “Moustache” was not
worried. When asked about his
chances,” he answered, “In Yogi
or for this weekend?”

Upon viewing “F1ashbu~sh’s”
letter, Mike “Hawk” Brourman
commented, “Now I know why
they call Brooklyn the city of
bridges. They all have bats in
their belfrie-s.”

A-s for his own chances, the
“Hawk” assumed a regal pose,
wings outstretched and beak

held high, and decreed, “I shall‘ ‘'

show no mercy. This weekend

I am out for blood.”
