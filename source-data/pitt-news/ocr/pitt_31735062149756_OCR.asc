Grid Squad’ s
Banquet Ecte

Lack of Support
Blamed byrs-g;,,l,..eaders

What last year was supposed
to become a tradition at Pitt———
an SFA-sponsored banquet hon-
oring football .players—has be-
come just another optimistic
dream. .

This was the effect of an’ an-
nouncement made by the SFA—ex-
ecutive committee to abandon the
project because of a cramped budget
and lack of student support of the
ambitious experiment. A-

Last year’s banquet followed a
University promise to appropriate
up to $300 to take care of the ex-
penses of the football team, mem-
bers of the band, and the rental of
Memorial hall for such an affair.

Attendance Small

Attending the banquet were 502
persons: 107 band members; 51
football members and coaches; 22
speakers; nine representatives of the
press, and 317 students.

Excerpts from speeches made at
the banquet and editorials from last
year’s copies of the News tell of
the optimism with which the “tra-
dition” was to be launched through
the support of the students who
were expected to back the team.

Chancellor John G. Bowman said,
“This party is more like Pitt ought
to be than anything I ever saw.
It’s great stuff.”

Another speaker said, “Tonight’s
football dinner is an expression of
the loyalty typical of Pitt students.
Let’s continue to carry out this
loyalty to our Chancellor and the
University.”

Editorial Cited

An editorial of November 22 ex-
plained the hopes of student editors.
“It will be a chance to demonstrate
real school spirit and to show the
team the support given it by its

Z653

. fellow students.”

Another one declared that “the
student body ought to turn out with
its best Pitt spirit.”

“SFA’s banquet tomorrow will
demonstrate whether the school
spirit of Pitt students extends to the
point of meeting the cost of a foot-
ball banquet.”-

Instead of having a sell-out, the
banquet was generally considered
to be a failure on the part of the
students whose counterpart is seen
on practically every college cam-
pus, large or small.

Leaders Explain

; The banquet will no longer be a
tradition at Pitt because “students

V , don’t back their team when it comes
to attending abanquet, even though

they are pretty good fans when it
comes to cheering the team on Sat-

Roberts, BA41, president of SFA.

made so that Monday morning quar-

ball team has an unsuccess_f,ul.s,ea-

Frosh Dance
Petition Date
Set by Powell

Candidates for Freshman Dance
committee may obtain petitions to-
day from the dean of men’s or dean

of women’s ofﬁces, according to“

Roger Powell, E41, chairman of
SFA appointments committee.

“Petitions must be turned in by
5 o’clock, Friday, October 18,”
stated Powell. “All applicants for
post of chairman will be interviewed
by the appointments committee.
The time of interview will be given
when the‘ petition is submitted.
Committee members will not be in-
terviewed and are subject to the
ﬁnal choice of the selected chair-
man.

“A candidate for chairman of any
dance should possess certain quali-
ﬁcations. He is judged on leader-
ship as exempliﬁed in personality
and on the quality of workmanship
displayed in former activities, as

well as on his originality and busi- _

ness ability as shown in his planned
report for the dance,” explained
Powell.

“In “addition,” said Powell, “he
should know the ﬁnancial condition
of his class and have considered the
good and bad features of the pre-
vious year’s dance.” Reports of all
class dances are ﬁled in the dean

« of men’s oﬁice.

Prospective chairmen must sub-
mit a report on plans and budget
at the interview. They need not be
drawn up in any elaborate form but
should be well planned. Several
copies should be brought to the in-
terview.

Because of the lack of suitable
dance halls in the city, the Hotel
Schenley has been reserved for the
freshman dance, Powell added.

‘Score of Pitt Men Take to Air

In Training Program of CAA

By Ralph Kallock

Twenty University men, compris-
ing the ﬁrst unit enrolled in the
Civil Aeronautics Authority ﬂying
course began actual flight training
recently, under the tutelage of
Henry C. Pavian, professor of aeron-
autical engineering, and ﬂight in-
structors from the Pittsburgh Insti-
tute of Aeronautics, while a third
squad of 10 is being organized.

Class work and ﬂying are held
simultaneously. In addition to nav-
igation, instruction is givenlin air
safety, airport regulations, and civil
air law. Practical application is
made of ﬂight theory at Bettis air-
port, and at the conclusion of the
C0?-11‘S€ government examinations
covering both phases of the training
will be taken.

Each student has had a chance
to handle a ship in straight ﬂight,
and each was “introduced to turns”

‘on his trip up.

Every ﬂight is recorded in the
student’s log book. At the conclu-
sion of the course this book together
with the instructor's conﬁdential
ratings becomes the property of
the student. In addition to’ ﬂying
data this book contains. a printed
daily program of training which the
instructor must_ follow. _

By Ben Foote

The Pitt team that comes back to its classes this morning with
the bruises of Saturday’s titantic grid struggle will go on record as
one ofthe pluckiest elevens that ever wore the Blue and Gold, after
this gang of Panthers doggedly fought out a 7-7 deadlock with the
SMU Mustangs from the Southwest.

Teeming with more spectaculariplays than some of the greatest
scoring melees in,f0_0tball history, the contest left 40,000 grid fans as limp
as some forty pigskin warriors in this football Civil War. The thrill-a-
second slam-bang conﬂict was one of the hardest played football battles
ever staged in the Pitt Stadium—a clash which saw three Pitt gridders and
one umpire carried off the ﬁeld. More action packed the last two minutes
than any two minutes of a Wild Western gun battle.

Preston (Presto) Johnston provided the greatest thrill of the game as
he called on some of the prestidigitation his magical nickname implies, and
unleashed a booming spiral punt from behind his own goal line which
didn’t stop rolling until Edgar Jones fell on it two yards from the’ Pitt
goal line, 100 yards away. Seconds later, after Bobby Thurbon had booted
the Panthersrout of this hole, Georgia Kracum leaped high in the air with
one arm stretched heavenward and snared an enemy passheaded for touch-
down territory, halting the ﬁnal SMU threat.

The many renewals of the -Civil War which have been fought on the
barred ﬁeld are too numerous to relate, but it is doubtful whether any ex-
celled this one so far as wearing, tearing, hot-contested play is concern.
It would be hard to single out any man as outstanding, but Jack Goodridge,
who entered the fray when honorary captain Joe Rettinger was carried
from the ﬁeld in the ‘ﬁrst quarter, Edgar Jones, who improves every time
out, and Bobby Thurbon, the senior veteran, played the games of their
lives. The center of the Mustang line, guards Eddie Bianchi and Hoyle
Simes, and Preston Johnston stood out on Matty Bell’s eleven.

‘Entering the encounter as 2-1 underdogs, coach Charley Bowser’s ﬁrst
string boys, who toiled over 50 minutes, pushed the Mustangs all over the
Stadium turf on the grcundand gave no quarter in the sky.» :However,
no one in the Stadium left feeling that Dame Fortune treated the Panthers
unjustly, for the Methodists threw up stone—wall defenses on three early
Pitt drives and showed a very decent aerial attack. It was theback-to-the-
wall doggedness of the Mustangs versus the charging, pushing Pittites.

The locals struck pay dirt ﬁrst, when Thurbon tucked one of Jones’

ﬂings into his breadbasket in the northwest corner of the end zone. Rudy ‘

Gradisek, in the game up to his ears every minute,‘ previously ‘had jumped
on Clint McClai_n’s fumble on the Mustang back’s" own 31-yard stripe.
Special Delivery had then rung the bell on the three to Goodridgef it The
touchdown pass came after the Panthers were penalized ﬁve yards for ex-
cessive times out. Mike Sekela’s conversion split the uprights to give Pitt

.a 7-0 lead.

After a knock—down. drag-’em-out third quarter, SMU took possession
of the ball in Pitt territory, and_the riﬂe-armed Ray Mallouf shot a bullet
‘pass to Tommy Thomas, pint—siz‘ed Methodist wingman, who stepped over
the line for the score. Thomas continued to snarl the hair on the Pan-
t.her’s hide when heibooted a perfect placement for the extra point, helping
his mates to. a 7-7 stymie. "

Doctor Harold Clifford Carlson’s "

dream of an undefeated season was
a little closer to fulﬁllmeint today,
at least in the mihd of Pitt’s ag-
gressive 'r‘.‘,Win ’em‘ all” basketball

‘coach. ‘Describing Thursday’s prac-

tice session as “the best ﬁrst day’s

practice we’ve ever had,” Carlson

lookedvforward with rare optimism
to a schedule of l7"_.tough games,
only six of them at home.

Chief reason for Carlson’s enthu-
siasm is the return of most of last
year’s “sometimes the glamor boys”
squad. The Doctor feels that with
the addition of experience and sev-
eral good sophomores, last year’s
“hot and cold” team should develop
into this year’s champions.

Nine Lettermen Return

Returning lettermen include Mel
Port, Eddie Straloski, George Koch-
eran, Sam Milanovich, Lefty Ziol-
kowski, J ohn, Pataky, Jimmy Klein,
and Solly Levin. Larry Paﬁrath,
who was out of action all last year
after a brilliant sophomore season,
has also reported. Doc Carlson is
counting heavily on the “B1ond
Bombshell” to provide the spark
that may make this edition of the
Pitt. passers the best in many years.

Of the sophomores, who last year
were sent through a vigorous prac-
tice program underthe direction of

freshman mentor Paul Zehfuss, the

most outstanding recruits ‘are Malar-
key, Lohmeyer, and Silverman, with

to be made to determine whether or
not Rettinger broke his leg. Jack

Benz, Stan Gervelis, and Ralph Fife --

were also shaken up during the
course of the afternoon but not se-
riously.

Pitt outplayed the opposition along
the ground. ..g,..’l..‘l1e Panthers. ran up

mer current events seminars.

tions, as well as assume the func-
tions of Inquiry forum of past years.

outside authorities, but University
faculty and interested students as
well will be presented.

Arts 1
  Exliibits iworlis
By Sculptress

Sculptures, bronzes. and wood
carvings by Malvina Hoffman, in-

ternationally known sculptress who.

last year lectured at the University,
are being exhibited in the ﬁne arts
gallery on the seventh floor.

The present exhibition, which will
continue until November 5, con-
tains examples of her latest work as
well as many of the pieces done for

the famous Hall of Man at the

Field museum in Chicago.

These later works attempt to
make more vivid the complex va-
riety of the human race and at the
same time reveal the dignity and
unity of man.

Among the newer pieces are sev-
eral wood carvings which show con-
tinued development of Miss Hoff-
man’s genius. Although small in
scale they possess a monumental
grandeur in keeping with the primi-
tive forcefulness of her subjects.

Trained in the studio of Rodin,
Miss Hoffman possesses a thorough
background uncommon with Amer-
ican sculptors.

Although the Rodinesque influ-
ence faintly tinges all her work,
she has attained an individual ex-
pression.

Greeks Keep

Silence Wee]:

Rushees To Discuss
Bids To Fraternities

.Watchful waiting will be the
policy of fraternity men this week,
while rushees decide whether or not
they will accept bids to join fra-
ternities.‘ B‘

Silence week began yesterday

"morning and all fraternities were

required to submit sealed bids to

the office of the dean of_ men be-

fore 9:30 o’clock this morning.
During the week prospective

tpledges will meet with Robert R.

Corley, assistant dean of men, and
accept or reject fraternity invita-
tions, which will be made by the

' preferential. system from the office

of the dean of men.

All rushees should contact their
parents, by mail or visit. to seek
their counsel on the fraternity ques-
tion, advises Mr. Corley.

Mr. Corley also asks that rushees
do not cut classes to keep appoint-
ments but requests that students
come during designated days.

"At" the conclusion of silence
period, Monday, October 21, the of-
fice of the dean of men will give a
lis.t of acceptances and declinations
to the fraternities.

No fraternity is permitted to
pledge new students until Novem-
ber 21 when the sealed bids for
pledgeship are to be submitted to
the ofﬁce of the dean of men.

The traditional wager again was

, made by the assistant deans of men.

Theodore W. Biddle estimates the
total bids will be 589-, 389 indi-
vidual bids, and 189 acceptances.
Corley guesses there will be 575
total bids, 405 individual bids, and
320 acceptances. E. B. Williams
thinks that 645 will be the number
of the total bids and 395 individual
bids, and 196 acceptances will be
made.

Stakes are dinners paid by the
losers, and each assistant dean
promises to fill his “volume.”

Dr. Bishop Joins

Education Group 

Dr. F. L. Bishop, professor of
physics, is one of the 18 members
named to the operating committee
of the National Coordinating Com-
mittee on Education and Defense.

gineering from 1909 to 1927, when
he became professor of physics.

ciety for the Promotion of Engineer-
ing Education, Dr. Bishophas served
as secretary of the committee since
it was formed in 1914. He has ed-
ited the Journal of Engineering Ed-
ucation since 1914 and has -actedas
a_ member of the executive commit-
tee of the American Engineering
council. -

Betty Toddie, coed major of the
Band and The Panther’s wrestling
partner is simply thrilled with her
job . . . To put it in her own words,
“It’s marvelous . I look over
my shoulder and there are 120 men
. . . following me.” ’

One member of this team is tired

of all the praise for the feminine
member of the class of ’44 .
On -the list forfuture reference are
Dick Welsch, Paul Devlin, and Dick
Byers. (The other member isn’t
tired . . . yet.)

The right hand desk in the Dean
of Women’s office must have a
charm. The last three lovelies who
worked there left to get married,
and now Kay Sturm is wearing a
glow and a sparkler . . . The glow
comes from love and the sparkler
from Bill Milligan, Delt.

that this crop of rushees is a very

one house back on their heels by
asking how big the deﬁcit was . . .

Pitt Student Body

Sees Stroboscope

-A lecture, discussing the strobo-
scope as an aid to perfect instrument
tuning, will be given today at 12:30
o’clock in 132 Cathedral by Otto
Kraushaar, representative of a mu-
sical instrument company.-.

The stroboscope, demonstrated
before thousands at the New York
World’s fair this summer, has the
power of “freezing motion”; that
is, ‘ giving speedily ‘moving objects
the appearance of remaining still.

” Catching the speedy vibrations of"

the sound producing instrument,
and reducing them to a standstill,
the stroboscope can thus be used in
the scientiﬁc tuning of instruments.

All-A merican
Alumni Team
Entries Grow

A large number of nominations
for positions on the all-American
Achievement team to be announced
at the Alumni Homecoming Smoker
on Friday have been received. The
various positions on the teams are
to be ﬁlled by men who through
their vocations or activities after
graduation have added to Pitt’s
position.

While no attempt has been made‘

as yet by the General Alumni asso-
ciation to tabulate the suggestions
already received, the number of
nominations sent in for Hervey Al-
len, William C. Arthur, president of
Talon, Inc., and Gwilym Price, pres-
ident of Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust
company, have installed these men
as heavy favorites for places on the
team.

At the ﬁrst report. meeting held

last night by the Alumni association '

it was announced that the member-
ship and contribution drive is mak-
ing great strides toward the goal.
Already, with only partial reports
in membership and contributions
are about 400 per cent higher than
at this time last year. At the pres-
ent rate the goal of $20,000 in con-
tributions may be reached rather
easily and the membership should
top last year’s by about 400 mem-
bers, the committee indicated.
