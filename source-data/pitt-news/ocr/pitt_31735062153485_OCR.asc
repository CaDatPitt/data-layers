Several of the underclassmen have
spoken to the management in regard
to ordering Owls now. All those who
wish Owls can be accommodated pro-

were about” two hundred students who
were unable’ to purchase a year book

’ The same system will be followed
in» boosting lthis as was pursued so

“ successsfully for the -other Pitt Club

:.meeLtings.- Letters will be sent out,

signed by’ Secretary B. , F. Jenkins,

-and the members of the «committee, to

every Pitt-alumnus and student in

the county of-.\which there is record.

These will be in the hands of the

Pitt men and women by the time this

-issue of the weekly reaches. its read-a

ers. Then the student members will

follow up the letters by personal
work, seeing every Pittite in his ter-
ritory and getting his or her word
whether they will attend. Each
'— . booster will have a complete list of
-Pittites to check by. I .
“ A few days before the 9-banquet,
these boosters will make their re-
L_ ports to Secretary Jenkins at Jean-
nette and] he will make —arrange-
ments with the hotel people. It ».is
hoped that bythis system there will
be as many as 150 Pitt enthusasiasts
at the meeting.

"Representing the Alumni. Council
will be C. W. Scovel, '83 who "is chair-
man of the Alumni Activities» Com-
mittee of Alumni Council. M'r. Scovel
has bee.n identiﬁed with alumni af-
fairs at Pitt for many years and is an
ideal speaker for such an affair.
Dr. »M.cCormi-ck ws‘ at the or-
ganization L meeting a’ year ago.

‘Capt. “Chalky” 'Wil1iam;son, of -the
T1915‘ footbagl squad, will also be
there and tell «the Westmorelandites

L, something of our athletics. “Jack”
j Thompson will give someof his fam-
 L. ous readings and a good quartet from
_:the Glee Club will furnish music.
rseveral speakers will be on the pro-
gram from Westmoreland County,
one -being Wilbur: Hockensmith, la

- loyal Pitt man, who is president of
the Varsity Letter Club, a member of

Alumni Council- and active. in many

other ways for his Alma Mater-

The affair’ will be very informal and
an invitation is not ne-cessary to- Pitt
men or women to attend; If any Pitt-
ites in Westmoreland -County fail to
receive a notice, they should under-
stand that it is an oversight, due to
defects in the records.

Secretary B. F. Jenkins was in

» Pittsburgh last week conferring with
 the Student Boosters Committee,’ Mr.

C. G. Ketchum, who is lending valu-

able aid in the Pitt Club -organization

work, and the Alumni secretary. The
doctor is! enthusiastic over the pros-
pects for a live meeting.

A number of live Westmoreland
alumni have also been heard from ‘al-
ready -and they are working hard to
make it a hummer. One of the best
boosters will be E. D. Seitz, of the

 

 

East Pittsburgh Improvement Coma;

pany, Tr-afford City. Mr. Seitz is a
live wire at everything he takes up,
-hisspecialty being tennis; he being
the prime mover in putting Traf-
ford City on the map in that respect.
He attended the organization meet-
ing at Greensburg a year ago.
L Dr. R-oss-»»R. Feightner of Greens-

Letter Comes From
 Former Grid Tutor

A letter has been received from
Arthur St. Leger Mosse, W. U. P.’s
old football coach, which will be in-‘
teresting to “grads” of the ‘O6 and
’07 days. With it was an announce-
ment as follows»: L V .

“Arthur St. Leger Mosse, for over.
2.0 years: connected with football as
‘ player, coach and oﬁicial, is open-to
engagement as an oiﬁcial for coming
season of 1916. Address Arthur St.
Leger lMtosse-, Leavenworth, Kansas.
R. F. D. No. 5.” . 5
Pretty up-to-date stuff for Mosse,
eh! “"

Here is an excerpt from the
Boy’s letter:

“Congratulations on your football
season. It was the most successful
you ever had, considering the teams
you played. When you are starting
your trophy room at Pittsburgh, don’t
forget the men who are really re-
sponsible for the renaissance» of foot-
ball. Foremost of all, honor is due
Ralph Park, without whose help it
would have been impossible for me
to have _done anything in the way of
stirring up; football there. Then
comes; the Alumni Committee that
Ralph and I organized: Hocken-
smith, Dick Wallace, Sam Hunter
and Guy Wallace. These men worked‘
in the. face of almost unsurmountable
dlﬂi-culties and their names's.houl»d be
in the Hal-Vl_of Fame. I wonder if
I’m not entitled to a “P” a:s.~rI par-
ticipate-ds in «the V Penn State and

Alumni Guaranteed  
    Music Publication

 

In the January 19th issue‘ o-f the

Cap and Gown club music, which will
be a feature of “Suite 16,” the vehicle
bywhich the college Thespians ex-

‘Theatre, February 11th and 12th.
This music is by Gus A. Schnabel,
Col. ’15, the bookand lyrics being
furnished by G. Norman Re«is,,L C01.
016. ~ . '

There “is considerable expense in-
volved in publishing this music and
it is well to note here that it was
only made possible through the gen-
erosity of two of our well known
alumni-—B. H. Smyers, Col. ’93, “ and
R. T. McCormick, En-gr. 788.

The cost of publishing this music
in volume form and including all the
songs in “Suite 16”——was something
like $400.00 and Messrs. Smyers and
lVLoCorm.i-ck have given the ﬁnancial
backing necessary for this. The
volumes, which contain 12 numbers,
.are to be sold for $1.00 each, and
orders for them can be left at the
Alumni oﬁice. They will also be on
sale at iflhe theatre on the days of
the show.

University -circles caused so much sur-
prise Vand joy as the conﬁrmation of
the . repont that Dr.L Walther Riddle
had been appointeda Fellow in the
Mellon Institute of . Industrial VRe'-
search. 0 1 « ' V
In conﬁrming the report Dr. R. F.
Bacon, Director of the Mellon. Insti-
tute, said: ‘ V i
“I have had no greater pleasure, as

‘Director of the Mellon Institute, than

I experienced in appointing Dr. Rid-
dle a Fellow. When the ﬁrm of which
Dr.’ Riddle is anoﬂicer decided to
place a. Fellowship in the Institute, I
was very anxious that Dr. Riddle
should accept the position of Fellow
on it. I am, -certainly glad that we
have been able to make the arrange-
ments .for him to come to. the Mel-
lon Institute. I am sure that his ap-
pointment and his ‘presence on the
campus will be received with" approv-
al by faculty members, alumni and
students.

“His ‘appointment gives me an op-
portunity to point out the type of men

that we are drawing to the Mellon In- I

sti-'tute‘VL.asLLFellows. L Of course, we
know that the success of the Indus-

trial Fellowship System depends in

a large measure on the quality of the
researchers-"we are able to attract to
the ’ Institute. We have now some
sixty-ﬁve men and we feel that we
have the largest and besVt ‘trained
group of research men in the coun-
try. The Mellon Institute is more
and more attracting men of the abil-
ity ‘-and training of Dr. Ridd1e.”.

Dr. Walther Riddle is one of the
best known and probably the most
popular ‘alumnus of the University. Dr
Riddle comes from what may be term-
ed a University family. Dr. Riddle’s
father, Dr. Matthew Brown Riddle,
was a student at the University in
1849350 and. has always been closely

aﬁiliated with the work of the Uni-
His grandfather, Reverend

versi-ty.
David H. Riddle, was -acting ‘Chancel-
lor in the early days of the Univer-
sity. 7 ‘

Dr. Riddle attended the old Uni-
versity Prep School for one year,
188798. He entered the College ofthe
University in 1888«an=d was graduated
in 1892. Dr. Riddle’s interest’ in all
things» pertaining to the University,
especially to student activities, comes
in a measure out of his activities as a
student. He , was President of the
old Irving Literary Society during his
Senior year, Editor-in-Chief of the
Courant-—-the predecessor of theL_Pitt
Weekly-——-1891-’2, first President of the

Glee Club, and a member of the

After Dr. Riddle was graduated.

from the University, he went to the
University of Heidelberg where he
studied under Professor Viictor Meyer.
In 31894, Heidelberg conferred upon

him the Degree of Doctor of Philoso-

for a time at the Universityunder his
good old friend and teacher Dr. Fran-

Since Coach Reinecke has assumed
charge of the wrestling aspirants a
new spirit has pervaded the camp.
All of the candidates are working
their hardest to build up a ‘repre-
sentative’ aggregation that will cope
favorably with the antagonists to be

, encountered. The progress of the men

is -s;es;:- rapid that Coach Reinecke feels
conﬁdent that State will experience
stubb-ornl resistance on February 2-6.

Lubic’sT invincible quintet tomorrow
evening in Trees Gymnasium, and in-
dications point toward a. thrilling tus-
sle, .Pitt’s task in‘ conquering the Ham-
iltonians takes on great proportions

‘when the relative experience of the
two teamsis considered. This will be

the second engagement between Pitt

and Colgate on the basketball Lﬂoor.

‘Two years ago Pitt suffered defeat at
the hands of the clever Colgate
passers, and the cohorts of old “Uni
are aiming to avenge that setback, but”
the feat of humbling the New York
delegation looms up large when it, is
considered that practically the same
aggregation that swamped Pitt two
years -ago will appear against Captain
Lubic’s‘ stars. Coach ‘Flint has only
his versatile -captain left over from

the team’ that met Colgate before, and L 0

thecoaching preparatory to this con-
ﬂicthas been centered about Lubic-
For the visitors, Kennedy and Van
Alstyne are a skilled pair of forwards,
who, if not guarded closely, are liable

to turn defeat into victory at any-

stage. These men together with Stew-
art and Glendenning are. holdovers,
while”‘Reid, the only newcomerto the
squad, is heralded as a, talented shot

-and jumper of nomean ability.”

Coach Flint will build his attack
around the veteran Lubic and the ma-
chine formed by Hastings, Matson, Mc-

N_ulty and McM'asters ought to have
potentiality enough in its defence and

effectiveness in its ‘offensive work ‘Pb
frustrate the hopes of the veterans

from Colgate. '

Yale, last year’s  intgrcollegiate

champions», felt the sting» of defeat
T_ from the ability of above mentioned

machine, and relative to that victory
our men are ‘regarded as favorites.
However, the , cohorts of Captain

Lubic face 3. powerful menace in the

Colgate iinvaders ‘who, are rated
among the most- skilled ﬂoor artists
of the ‘East. Pitt must play better-ball

did against Yale Tifshe hopestobe
