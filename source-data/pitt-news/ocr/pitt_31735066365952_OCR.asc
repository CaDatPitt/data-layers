 Ctttback of funds threatens Westerrt Psych.

by BOB GEDEKOH
Associate Editor

A proposed 60 per cent cutback
of state funds for the operation of
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic is seriously threatening the
operation of the institute. accord-
ing to Edison Montgomery,- Vice
Chancellor for the Health Profes-
sions. The proposed, reduction.
which would provide only $1.25
million instead of the requested $3
million. is included in the Gov-
ernor's budget to be presented to
the legislature in the near future.

Montgomery hopes that the,bud-
get will be amended to increase
the allocation for the operation of
the hospital. Otherwise the insti-
tute will be shut down by the Uni-
versity. Russ Arnold; director of
University-Governmental_ Rela-
tions. claims that the University
will have the support of Senator
Fleming. Republican
Floor Leader. in its battle to have
the lost funds restored. WPIC has
received $2.5 million annually
from the state for the last seven
years. but University officials re-
gard this as a continual reduction
due to inflation. .

The Governors office claims
that the administrators of WPIC
did not supply all of the necessary
information needed to make the
$3 million grant. but University

’ , administrators say that the state

was given all the information it_
ever requested. "To date we have
not been told what they want."
Montgomery said.

WPIC has been charged ‘with.

overemphasizing teaching and re-
search at the expense of treat-
ment by various individuals in the
state government. Montgomery
admits that all of the beds in the
institute are not full but claims

' that the "treatment of mentally ill

people in a hospital is old fashion-
ed; modern treatment tries to get
away from the old idea of an in-
sane asylum."

Arnold emphasized that the in-

WPIC is operated in a .way that
facilitates the fulfillment of each
goal without interfering with the
others, he added. The institute is
closely affiliated with the medi-
cal school and is used in the train-
ing of doctors, nurses and psy-
chiatric personnel.

Montgomery says that the Uni-

a custodial institution for the

need for trained psychiatric per-
sonnel. Duff of_fered WPIC to
Pitt‘s Chancellor Fitzgerald un-
der the agreement that the insti- -
tute would emphasize education
and research as well as treat-
ment. When Pitt accepted control
of WPIC, Fitzgerald insisted that
WPIC should never drain funds
from other University operations.

Montgomery added that Pitt is

not willing to “change the rules‘

now that the state‘s subsidy to

WPIC is threatened.” He noted '

that Eastern Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic, which was built at the
same time as WPIC and operated

by the State Department of Wel- -
fare, received annual subsides as

high as $20 million from the state.

Montgomery is especially con-
cerned with several new pro-
grams which are being threatened
by the cutback. They include work
in child psychology, geriatric re-

search and the treatment of so-'

cially connected ills such as alco-
holism, drug abuse and insanity

among underperivileged Ameri-' .

cans. Montgomery noted that un-
less WPIC is financially able to
continue its research and educa-
tional programs the University is
unwilling to maintain the burden
of the institute.

The capitation grant to the med-

ical school has also beencut in. -.

in that the $7,465 formerly award-
ed to" the school by the state for

Martire, who said he still owns
the building, said he owned the

1966, until August 31, 1969, when it
was taken over by new operators.

No new filing has been made by

 P-age 2—THE PITT NEWS—Tuesday, May 2, 1972

(‘Appropriations committee hits merlical schools

told the committee that this would
cause "a grave worry and con-
cern and constitute a disasterod -
rain on our resources."

The legislators questioned the
nature and function of Western
Psych and complained that they
had not received enough informa-
tion about the facilit_v when they
were considering its budget.

After the Chancellor, Dr. Don-

-ald Medéaris, Dean of the Medi-

cal School, and Dr. Cheever,
Vice Chancellor of the Health Pro
fessions, attempted to answer
their questions, Representative
Mullens, chairman of the commit-
tee, told them that the fate of
Western Psych lay with the
Department of Welfare which was

so dishonest that their appropria-

tion was to be disasterously cut.

Posvar also explained thal
funding for salaries and goods
and services had to come through
the Appropriations Committee be-
cause tuition. federal funds and
private. incomeare all stable.
He pointed out that tuition had in-
creased 217 per cent since Pitt
first became state—related and
that further increases are not
feasible.

He stated that the increasing

tuition is driving out able candi-

dates fro lower-middle income
classes. This. Posvar stated. runs
contrary to the goals of a public
university. _

The committee members claim-
ed that the medical schools did
not consider the plight of resi-
dents of rural areas in accepting
students from these areas.

They stated that once students
graduated they did not practice in
rural areas. Several representa-
tives complained that the schools
did not admit students whom they
recommend.

Representatives of all three
schools stated that they attempt-
ed to admit qualified students
from all regions of the state. but
they had no control over
where students went when they
graduated. . .

It was suggested that the state
should buildspitals and clinics
in these areas in order to attract
doctors. _

-The universities all stressed
the need for state appropriations
in applying for federal funds. a
process which requires matching
money from the universities.

 Posvar grants degrees to class

 

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD
News Editor

“By the authority vested in me
the Board of Trustees, I confer
upon you the degree of Bachelor
of Arts and Bachelor of Sciences,
respectively, with all the rights,
privileges, and responsibilities
pertaining thereto.”

Thus the Chancellor charged
the graduating class of 1972 of the
College of Arts and Sciences. one
of the 15 schools graduating over
6,000 students at Sunday’s Com-
mencement exercises at the Civ-
ic Arena.

Posvar’s opening address re-
vealed the distinctions of the class
of ’72, that it is “the first year
rthe Johnstown campus was rec-
ognized as a four-year degree-
granting institution,” and that

this was “the first class in which .

a significant number of minority
groups were enrolled, increasing
the opportunity for social justice.”

The guest speaker at Com-
mencement. Dr. Marina Whit-

ma-I1. newly appointed member Of systems will overshoot and col- '

the President's Council of Eco-
nomic Advisors and professor of
economics at Pitt, addressed the
audience on the economic pros-
pects for the last quarter of the
20th century.

Beginning her speech with
"Commencement speeches are
supposed to look to the future . . .
and tell the graduates it’s all
yours," she decidely turned the
tables saying, “I‘m not going to.“

She focused her remarks on the
economics of social problems we
must face in the foreseeable fu-
ture.

Noting a recent court decision
in California which makes it un-
constitutional for expenditures in
Public Education to be based on
income levels Dr. Whitmanraised
the question of equalizing educa-
tion expenditures.-

Changing focus, she stated “the
epitome of concern can be found
in a MIT study which predicts that
at the recent rate of growth world

lapse within the next 100 years.”

Touching on the population cris-
is, .Dr. Whitman noted that the
U._S. is experiencing a "sharp
drop in population growth.’

“Now it’s just about down/to re-
placement level . not quite
zero,-population growth.”

Summarizing her statements,
Whitman presented the philoso-
phy of rising expectations which
is “usually applied to underdevel-

/

oped countries but can be applied ‘

here and now to the quality of
life.”

. She stated that defense spend-
ing is down f_romi50 to 30 per cent
of the budget and that spending
on domestic problems has in-
creased. “Yet all of us still are
overwhelmed by social prob-
lems,” she continued.

Considering possible solutions,

to the problems facing America, '

Whitman said, “There is no such

thing as a free lunch‘.  There .

are no easy answers.”

Marina Whitman, first woman
appointee to the President’s Coun-

ter Sunday. .

Asked about the possibility of a
political motive for various eco-

Quizzed on the positive steps

might answer better, but as far as

I know there is not yet a specific.

Asked how she might address
the problem of six per cent unem-

communities of 12 percent. un-

eniployment, Whitman responded,

“When unemployment drops,
black unemployment drops too.”

The Pittsburgh Emergency Action Coalition has declared a

The activities will consist of a march, leaving the Fifth

_ _The moratorium also protests the econom-ic crisis of rising
unemployment and prices while wages remain frozen.

;.v v has expected North Vietnam to sit at the conference table while
" our bombs are falling on their land.

" I It should be obvious by now that a settlement will not be
reached on Vietnam while American troops are present in that
country.’

Letters to the Editor  

Misplaced Remarks

Editor. The Pitt News:

In a recent (April 5) letter to
The Pitt News, Kathleen Thomp-
son praised an article critical of
welfare reform and presented her
own case for the readers‘ s_ympa-
thy: She has been cut off from
food stamps because her living to-
gether with another student is no
longer qualifiedias a household.

Miss Thompson is indignant
that this new rule is so clearly
directed against students (as well
as. I suppose. communes and co-
habitations) and sputters to us
that. "It would seem that under
the new ‘reforms’ eligibility for
both food stamps and welfare is
no longer based on financial need.
but. instead. is based on whether
or not the legislators like your life
style."

Miss Thompson‘s slap at “the
legislators“ is misplaced: they
are only doing what they know the
majority of the public that elects
them would want them to. The
taxpayers. for their part. do not
hand out money any more cheer-
fully through the indirect medium
of welfare than they do directly.

to panhandlers on the street. If
the public finds people in Miss
Thompson‘s position to be “un-
deserving“ panhandlers —— for
whatever reason—that is its priv-
ilege. '

"Miss Thompson should be wise
to give up her assumption that
public support was ever based
solely on"'need." She may wish
to argue with the taxpayers that
somehow their support of her
would be to their benefit. but
shouldnot consider it her right
and she should expect a critical
reception for her claims to po-
tential value. In any case. for her
to direct her anger at "the legis-
lators." bypassing the interests
of the taxpayers and considering
them only a_ passive source of
money. is reprehensible arro-
gance on her part.

Realismand common sense

By HARRY MORRISON
Special to the Pitt News

(Editor‘s_ note: Mr.-T
was one of the organizers of the
first industrial CIO at the West-
inghouse plant in East Pittsburgh
where he was a tool makerfor
35 years. He has written this pa-
per on the problems of organized
labor. based"upon his experiences
as a union member. This is the
first part of a two part conden-
sation.) ‘~

Union workers are in a posi-
tion to create and maintain pros-
perity. but frequent protracted
strikes destroy—this potential and

‘damage. the interests of our popu-
lation and the interests of the,

striking workers themselves.

When union leaders want to
call a strike they will do so and
arrange it so that the workers will
vote for a strike. All strikes. even
“wild cat" strikes-are organized
by union leaders and are against
the interests of organized labor
and the general population.

»_In the beginning these lead-

ers were of a different sort. truly
idealistic and sincerely interest-
ed in helping the workers. They
came from the ranks of labor
and received no pay for their
leadership.

The growth of industry made
it possible for "organized labor to
grow and entrench itself in the
shops thus increasing the pur-
chasing power of the workers and
enlarging the markets for indus-
try. ,

In the‘ beginning of our tech-
nical development. workers were
producers. but not a con-
suming factor. The consumers
consisted of a middle class of
the military, and government

employees and a few rich citi-

zens. Later, when the unions
came into existence. the workers
became a middle classpossessing

considerable purchasing power.

These conditions. however.
brought onhlarger depressions.
When the new middle class lost
its purchasing power more se-
vere depressions resulted. A
thorough change has"resulted in

‘the causes of attainment of pros—'_

pe‘rity.’In the past. the stable
middle class created their own
prosperity and their purchasing
power did not decrease. in times
of depression. >

I was created from the new mid-

dle class. organized labor. When
the depression came it was im-

possible for the stable consum-

ers’ to bring about prosperity
because they were small in num-
ber. The new middle class lost the
ability to bring about prosperity
when its members lost jobs. -
The depression continued until
the second world war. There was
no recession after the second
world war because unions had
in big industry and
workers earned high enough wag-
es to save money and {maintain

their purchasing power even
after the war.
This purchasing power con-

tinued until the outbreak ‘ of
senseless unjustified strikes which
consumed the capitol that the
workers accumulated during the
second World War. ' '

In answer to protests against
these frequent and drawn out
strikes. the union leaders reply
that if it were not for strikes in
the past we would have no un-
ions now. At the beginning, how-
ever. strikes were the only means
to attain a higher standard of
living. '

But. now. even when these
strikes are successful. the work-
ers actually lose. for often pric-
es rise as a result of the strike
and nullify the raise that the
workers achieve. When wages
and the cost of living increase
at the same time, the worker
cannot benefit.

But if strikes are against the
interests of the workers, why do
we have so many strikes now.
Although we read in the press
the workers vote in favor of
strikes, I can assure you that this
is not true’. I am myself a‘ work
er and I participated in several
strikes and I can assure you that
when the ‘union leaders want
to call a strike they will have
one. .When they want the ma-
jority of workers to vote for a
strike they will obtain the vote
(sometimes through fraud )

Everyone can readily under-
stand that strikes are against the
interests of the workers. The only
ones responsible for strikes are
the Union leaders. The leaders
are estranged from the workers.
They are above the workers like
officers are above soldiers. In
e wa re aware that

e - ' -

    

   

   

hen th

ke th -*

workers must obey. When unions
were first established. the offi-
cers themselves‘ were workers
and enjoyed no _ privileges be-
cause of their leadership.

The present union leade_rs are '

politicians interested primarily in

material comfort and power and
they use the workers for their_
* own purposes. Strikes result when

lower grade union officers ac-
cuse the leadership of being
soft in an attempt to discredit
them and usurp their power.

Only a small number of active
members attend union meetings
and formulate policy. The lead-
ers discourage- attendence at
meetings by holding them at in-
convenient times and at short no-

. tice.

I once pointed out to a union
steward that theunion leaders
were becoming dictatorial and
didn’t reckon with the opinions
of the workers.

He said, "You know how to
make tools, we know how to con-
duct a union. We do not tell you

how. to make tools and_ you‘

needn’t -tell us how to run

the
union. ' -

'1

Workers have learned that there
is no sense or use in protesting.

Take a look at the University. of Colorado...
The main campus of the University of Colorado is located at Boulder,
an attractive research and education oriented community of 70.000 located I

at the base of the front range of the Rocky Mountains, 30 miles northwest
of Denver. I
Within the basic 10-week session, beginning June 9 and ending August I

I 18, the many schools and colleges of the university offer shorter term courses

of 2, 3. 5, 6. or 8 weeks. Intensive study programs in French. German and
I Spanish designed primarily for foreign language teachers will.stress recent I
I developments in instructional theory and classroom implementation.'The I
I College of ,Arts and Sciences is also offering a core of interrelated courses I

I from 6 to 9 credit hours that will explore a subject in depth and from more

than one viewpoint. Students living in residence halls and participating in
the program can choose to be given rooms in the same area as other partici- I
pants. The classes will be small. designed for maximum participation and I

I interaction between students. and outside field trips are ‘scheduled. Areas
of study in the program are: The Religious Dimension in Human Experience. I

I The Asian Experience. Literature and Art of Nigeria and Shakespeare: Theory
I and Performance. I I

   

I The University plans a rich calendar of cultural events for the summer. I

I The annual Colorado Shakespeare Festival has scheduled 17 performancesof 

I Anthony and Cleopatra, The Winter's Tale and Vo/pone during July and August
in the Mary Ri'ppon Outdoor Theatre. Thegopera Tosca by Puccini is scheduled I
for July. and throughout the summer there will be modern dance concerts.

I pipe organ concerts and other musical concerts by eminent artists from both I '

this country and abroad. Large and small rock concerts have been scheduled I

I in the past by both the University and private organizations as bookings I

became available.

With the closeness of the surrounding Rocky Mountains, CU has deve|- I
oped a very popular mountain recreation department. Both the Summit

» I Program and the more strenuous Technical Rock Climbing Program are

geared to the abilites of the novice or the expert. Co-ed campouts. hikes I
I and climbs are scheduled and for the more adventuresome there are super-
I vised climbs on major peaks along the Continental Divide. Equipment is I
provided for both programs. V ‘ I
I Colorado's temperate climate of cool nights and warm days will allow you I
to take advantage of the many recreational opportunities available on I
campus. Facilities. equipment and fields are available for nearly any activity
I or sport. The surrounding community offers horseback riding, water skiing.
I golf and sailboating. Close to Boulder is Rocky Mountain National Park and I
the Roosevelt. Pike. and Arapahoe National Forests with their thousands of I
I acres ofmountain scenery. campgrounds and tourist attractions. Half day
drives into the mountains will take you to towns such as Aspen, Vail and I
I Glenwood Springs.
I Have a different kind of ‘summer this year, come to the University of.
Colorado. You will advance your education and you will have a good summer, I
I one that won't soon be forgotten. Write today for a school bulletin and ask

Suspicious Chinese hamper °Odyssey’ coverage

by MIKE MILLER
Bob Vitarelli. CBS producer—di-
rector of "China Odyssey“ left the
Peoples Republic of China with
one small regret.

"l should have scratched ‘Phi
Delta Theta‘ on the Great Wall."
he laughed.

Vitarelli, a University of Pitts-
burgh graduate and Phi Delt
alumnus was in town producing
“Face the Nation” last week and
he spoke with Pitt News reporters
about his adventures covering
President Nixon7s trip behind the
bamboo curtain.

He expressed surprise at being
chosen for the China assignment.
but felt that his overseas experi-

‘ ence may have had something to

do with it.

As producer—director of "Face
the Nation“ he has carried his
cameras to such places as Viet-
nam. Brazil. Central America.
lthodesia. Algeria. Tunisia. ls-
rael. lilgypt and throughout Eur-
ope.

The China assignment present-
ed some unique difficulties, how-
ever.

The American television per-
sonnel were hampered by con-
stant supervision and paranoid re-
actions to technical apparatus.

“They were afraid of our coin-
munications equipment." Vitar-
elli said. The Chinese
communications between remote

fouled"

units and the transmission center
by cutting down the power of a 450
watt short wave radio to 24 watts.

This necessitated relaying com-
munications through a transmit-
ter on the roof of a hotel in Peking
to the transmission center at the
airport.

‘'1 guess they thought we were
going to call in bombers or some-
thing.“ he said.

“They were very touchy about
any strange device.“ he reported.
When he surveys a location. Vitar-
elli uses a small compass to de-
termine where the sun will be

when the actual shooting takes

place.
This greatly upset the “inter-

preter” who constantly accom-
panied him. “He figured it was
some sort of secret device,” Vi-
tarelli explained. ‘
Walkie talkies
more suspicion.
ln addition. all members of the

aroused even

. crew were completely restricted

in their movements. They had to
ask permission to take pictures.
were not allowed to talk to people
on the street or leave the hotel
without a guard. T

However, Vitarelli was able to
sneak out by himself on the last
day of the trip in Shanghi.

“It was a great experience." he
said. "I was a real oddity."

The Americans were unable to
to'ur Chinese television facilities
because “they were obviously em-
barrassed.“ Vitarelli said.

The station in Peking broad-
casts only three hours a day —
mostly political programs. Color
TV is not yet developed and black
and white techniques are primi-
tive.

The Chinese were extremely
eager to learn the techniques of
the Americans. Each crewman
was paired with a Chinese coun-

terpart who "just got in the way," 

Vitarelli reported.

Vitarelli made note of the graf-
itti on the Great Wall of China.
"There were a lot of Chinese
names and characters,” he said.

In the Kilroy tradition, a came-
ra crew chiseled their names into
the wall with a screwdriver and
photographed them as if they
were credits.

This. however. did not make the
national broadcast.

“It's not the kind of thing “you
would be proud to show.“ Vitar-
elli laughed.

,_The first meeting of the North-

“ ,-East Region of the National Inter-

Fraternity Conference (NIC) was
held April 21 and 22 at the William

 jPenn. Hotel. Prior to this meeting
 there had been only three NIC re-
: gions, Far West, South East, and
‘, Mid Continent.

The idea of creating the new re-

v gion came out of the nationwide

meeting of the NIC which was

 held in St. Louis in December of
 1971. The Pitt lnfraternity Coun-

Dean. of Student Affairs at Pitt,
gave the welcoming address to the
approximately 80 deleages. The

Non violence

still the way

ATLANTA. Ga. (AP)—Does the
0C§I‘1'ne of nonviolence as prac-
ticed by the late Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King have a place in the 705‘?
Civil rights
does.

leaders insist it

Revolutionary violence, they
say, has no place in the move-
ment to wipe out lingering racism
in education, politics and the eco-
nomy.

Their views are included in a
booklet published by the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Institute for Non-
violent Social Change in Atlanta.
The 40-page publication grew out
of a series ofconferences Held by
the center to examine the future
of the nonviolent movement in
America.

The text consists of lectures
on the subject given by a diverse
group of educators, civil rights
leaders, ministers and others.

The theme of the lectures was
struck by the Rev. James Lawson
of Memphis, Tenn.,’where King
was assassinated in 1968.

"Violence cannot build justice," 5

he said. "It cannot heal the sav-
age spirit of America. It can only
mold. and multiply that spirit. "
"Violent ideologies, tactics or
structures cannot heal a violent
land." ‘ '

A new Pilot Program was intro-
duced at the recent Mentor train-
ing camp held at the Pitt campus
during the term break.

The revised goals of Mentor un-
der the Pilot Program. as explain-
ed by Mentor Chairman Terrie
Amelio. are to promote an ongo-
ing orientation for freshmen. to
serve as peer counselors and re-
source people. and to give atten-
tion to academic issues which
have been neglected in the past.

The four day training workshop
was divided into four areas: ex-
planation and application of small
group dynamics, orientation to
University programs and serv-
ices, discussion on the philoso-
phy of the educational process,
and presentation of the Mentor’s
role at the June orientation for
freshmen.

The group dynamics program
was lead by Jim Yaksich. vice-
president at Slippery Rock State
College. The explanation of group
dynamics tore the group process
into a series of one-to-one rela-
t.ionships. A lab exercise involved
the group in a joint production of a
poster, emphasizing the roles of
the individual group members in
the total functioning of the group.

One evening of the workshop
explored the black-white experi-
ence. Dr.‘Lloyd Bell. Assistant
Vice Chancellor of Public Affairs
and director of Urban Community
Services, descriptively reviewed
the history of blacks in America.
relating it to interpersonal rela-
tionships between blacks and
whites. To further explore the
black-white relationship, small
discussion groups met with blacks.

As a resource source, the Men-
tor will be expected to be able to
give out information on many of
the University’s programs and
services. There were speakers on
Student Aid, Student Health Serv-
ices, the University Counseling
Center, Women’s Studies, Fresh-
men Studies, Black Studies, and
University-Community Education
Program. Several student serv-
ices, such .as the Commuter As-
sociation, Student Government,
the Legal Awareness Committee,
Medical Action Committee, the
Tennant’s Union, the Liberal Arts
Cabinet, and the Homecoming
Committee, were represented. In

  Pilot Mentor Program sets

addition Mentors will be asked to
supplement the Advising Center
in helping freshmen register by
giving tips on courses, profes-
sors, and
dures. . .
The proposed kickoff program
at the June 18-22 Freshman Ori-
entation will attempt_to encour-
age freshmen to explore the phil-
osophical side of their decision to
pursue higher education—to de-
termine why they are there. what
they hope to gain from the experi-
ence. and how to go about making
the most of their years at the

The role of the Mentors at the
June Orientation will be fourfold.
As a personal advisor, the Men-
tor will be acting as a peer coun-
selor, a friend, and an upperclass-
man with experiences to share
with the freshmen. As an academ-
ic advisor, the mentor will work
alone and with faculty members
to provide information on depart-
ment offerings and alternative
academic programs as well as
course selection. As social host,

‘. When most of the University was enjoying a

‘work racking up six wins against only two losses.

The squad’s victories were: a doubleheader
sweep against Steubenville. 10-3 and 6-1; a 7-4 win
over Allegheny; a well pitched 1-O battle against
Bucknell; a 10-inning squeaker against Gettysburg:

Kent State. Ohio—The Pitt base-
ball team upped its season re-
cord to 7-2 yesterday. squeaking
passed the Kent State Golden
Flashes in a 6-5 contest with an

ounties dampen Cats’

According to the Pitt mentor the team" seems to
hit well during batting practice. "It‘s not a ques-

.tion of their doing something mechanically wrong-

they‘re not striking out in abundance. They're just
hitting at someone. We'll just have to weather the
storm and hope they start falling in."

Sore arms have hampered veteran-_pitchers
Mike Fedoris during the past two weeks and their
return to thelineup is imperitive in the upcoming
weeks.

'‘I- hope they come around. we need them this
week and the next." commented Lewis. "But
with some rest I think they'll be all right."

Helping to pick up the slack in the pitching
department have been sophomre Bill Shamott and

» freshmen ‘Buster Popovich and John Chir. 1

‘‘They’re doing an excellent job for us,” related
Lewis. “They’re doing both relief and start pitching.
The fellows have been able to just step in, they
have a lot of poise for a sophomre and freshmen.

"Right now we need more hitting. Our pitchers
can hold the opposition down but they can’t throw
shutouts every time out. "

What would seem to be an additional handicap
was the illness of ace catcher Guy Caparelli. Be-
cause of the flu. last year’s all-star catcher and one
of Pitt’s top hitters missed the Allegheny. Bucknell.
and Gettysburg games. ,

During Caprelli’s absence, Pete Martinelli
caught and figured in heavily in the scoring in the
Bucknell and Allegheny contests. - ‘

"Even though he was a little sick himself. Pete
did a great job filling in for Caparelli._" said__Le,wis.

With continued good fielding, the return of vet-
eran pitchers to the lineup. andimproved hitting.
Lewis expects the Panthers to increase their list of
victories. 1

The Pitt trackmen managed to
salvage some glory out of a very
trying month when they
forces last weekend to represent
the Blue and Gold at both the Penn
and Drake Relays.

While most tracksters around
the countr_v spend the month of
April grappling, opponents. the
Bannermen were busy grappling
with finals. papers and a host of
other unrelated (to track l topics.
Thus the "very pleasing perform-
ances in Philadelphia and Des
Moines were unexpected.

"I was very pleasantly surpris-
ed." related the squads head

mentor Jim Banner. "The boys '

did a good job."

Banner handled the Drake con-
tingent where Billy Rea finished
third in the long jump, while the
shuttle-hurdle relay team came
in fourth, and Mike Schurko did
his best time ever (9:05.3)/finish-

ing fourth in the Steeplechase.

Across the state at Penn.’ the
mile relay team turned in its best
time of the season. winning‘ this
event. while Steve Hein finished
third in the discus.

The Drake Relays. one of the
bigger invitationals held during
the track season, featured much
of the top talent in the country.
Banner called the spectacle "one

of the best track meets I've ever ‘

seen. And I've seen a lot of great
meets.

Rea’s showing of 25 feet was

substantially below the sopho-ﬂ

m0re’s best jump of 25’10” and
and once again the culprit can be
found in the month of April.

Planning to be at almost 26
feet by this time Rea has been
stalled.by a series of illnesses
that kept him sidelined for the last
half of last month. A virus which
,led to tonselitis has dented his
timetable considerably with the
Olympic trials coming up in June.

“This is the first time we've
ever failed to meet a goal we‘ve
set." indicated Banner. "but Bil-
ly's illness and the weather hurt.
Theres still a month and a half to
go. He can make it." .

Banner was a little disappoint-
ed with the hurdle relay squad and
its mark of'58.4, ‘although the time
did set a new school record.

“From the times in the trials.
everyone was so close. I though

we could win.‘f related the vet—-

eran coach. "Then they tightened
up in finals. but I still think they
did a good job." .

The hurdlers finished behind
Texas. Illinois and Kansas. the
last two.of which they beat in the
trials. Rick Carosielli's anchor
leg of 14 flat was the best-he's
ever turned in.

With Rick Jackson, Rich Weav-
er, Chuck Mozingo and Doral"Wat-
ley burning the track, Pitt cap-
tured its only first of the week-
end at Franklin Field, Saturday
with a time of 3:l2.1.

"I was hoping we might do that
well." commented Banner. In the
process Weaver (48.9). Mozingo
(47.6) and Watley (46.2) all turn-
ed in their best times ever. Jack-
son. who was home over the sem-
ester break working out on his
own and who has been sick. did
not perform up to par.

Pitt captured a third in the
discus throw Friday afternoon
when Hein hurled his platter 160.3
feet. Davis of the University of
Indiana copped first with a heave
of 163.6. ‘

missed that game due to a fever.

The team got back on the win-
ning track quickly, as they defeat-
ed Akron, 6-3,_in a game that had
been postponed due to cold weath-
er. Kantor, still weak, played and
won his singles match in two sets,
but ran out of steam in the dou-
bles, as he and Gary Schwartz
were beaten in thregsets.

Schwartz, along with Joel Hur-
witz, , lost their singles matches,
while George Dieffenbach, Tom
Current, and Wally Ellman were
victories. In the doubles, Diet-
fenbach and Current, as well as
Hurwitz and Mike Pines, won
their matches to wrap up the Pitt

A day later, the netmen white-
washed Duquesne, 9-0, and it also
saw Hurwitz in the hospital, with

what was believed to be food pois- '

oning. He is expected to be lost to
the team for the rest of the sea-
son. ‘

Veteran Mike Pines filled in for
Hurwitz, as he and the remaining
top five all won in the two set
minimum. Schwartz-Kantor and
Dieffenbach-Current again won
doubles, as well as Tom Mc-

with new card

by VICKY VETERE

The Pitt women netters are finding their new spring schedule some-
what difficult. With one match left to play, their season credits, thus

_ fa'r. consist of second place in the Kent State-Pitt—Ashland College tri-

meet played last Saturday.

The team, in the ‘past, has played a fall schedule in September
against schools not notorious for their tennis prowess. However,-coach
:‘Goldie” Edwards decided that their 1972 season would be played in
the’ spring against tougher competition. The women practiced indoors
at the NIT (National Indoor Tennis) courts in East Liberty, from mid-
February until mid-April.

The tennis season opened to face two delays—their first match_,

with Wheeling College was forfieted by Wheeling. and their second
match, also with Wheeling, was rained out.

' Then the netters finally kicked things off with a match at Chatham
College which Pitt lost, 1-4. Pitt took one singles match by way of Max-
ine L’ew', its number three. singles player. I

The women went on to meet Lock Haven State College, one of the
toughest schools on their schedule, and lost, but forced some very close
matches.

This past weekend the women netters were on the road and play-
ed Ohio University on Friday and both Kent State and Ashland College
on Saturday in a tri—meet situation. Ohio defeated Pitt, 4-1, with Pitt's
Joanne Kotjan getting the win in singles. — I

The tri—meet, however, saw .Pitt'come in a close second with the
scores Kent 7, Pitt 6, and Ashland 2. Pitt took four of six singles
matches, with Elaine Kingus bringing in two and Maxine Lew and Jo-
anne Kotjan taking one apiece. In doubles, Pitt was two for four, with

Cathy Cassell and Partner Candy Conklin winning both their matches. ‘

Now the women look forward to today’s meet with Chatham for the
second time, but now on their home battleground. ’

Moving from a fallseason in’ ’71 with no defeats, to this year’s
tough spring schedule showing_ some stinging defeats. together with
some hard-fought wins, proves that the switch was not an easy one.
Coach “Goldie” Edwards .realizes this and is pleased with the team’s
ovﬁrall performance in their first efforts to take on some real "tennis’»’

Sold on wishbone

Cecconi shows iDePrtsqua, way

by VINCE Di NARDO

L7ndoubtedly. a few eyebrows
were raised when Lou Cecconi.
Jr. was switched to running back
this spring. Lou Cecconi. Sr. is

the offensive co—ordinator for the"

Panther football team. Lou. Jr..
even though he was recruited as a
running back. spent last fall in the
defensive backfield.

“Huhm." a few skeptics must

is the offensive co-ordinator and
his son is a running back."

For the 6 foot. 185 pound run-

ning back. talklof "favoritism'“
will probably linger throughout

his career at Pitt. If history does
repeat itself. however. the only
way to quiet those rumors is by
performance. Such was case
of Pete and Press Maravich at
LSU and the Al ;\«lcGuires of Mar-
quette.

Congruently then, Lou Cecconi,
the athlete, has taken a substan-
tial step in eliminating any ideas
of nepotism concerning his father,
the coach.

ln this year‘s annual Blue-Gold
game. Cecconi did his best to
quiet skeptics.

With the future of the wishbone
offense at stake (7). Cecconi car-
ried the ball 13 times and netted
69 yards. The performance was
the best in the game of any run-
ning back. He showed savy and
knowledge of where to run with
the football. Besides that. he
caught two passes t'or 13 yards.

His 82. yard totalfor the game
almost doubled the output of any
other player. Bill Englert was
closest to Cecconi with ad 47 yard
total. And, his performance un-
doubfedly was a positive argu-
ment for Carl DePasqua’s com-

'mitment to the wishbone for the

fall season.

As far as the wishbone is con-
cerned. the Blue-Gold game was
encouraging. Despite the very
loose ball handling. which result-
ed in numerous fumbles (the team
practiced 20 days). the sub-par
performance of quarterback Bob
Medwid. and the bitterly cold
‘weather which provided a white
blanketof snowin the Pitt Stadi-
um stands. the offensive forma-
tion gained 323 yards on the
ground (an average of 3.6 a carry)
and 78 passying yards.
As those figures v_erify. Cecconi
didn‘t do all the running in the
game. /

Englert ran for‘ 47 yards in sev-
en attempts; Paul Felinczak cop-
ped 28 yards. on eight tries; John
Hogan ran for 22 yards; Ed Bren-
nan ran for 12 yards, and Medwid,
playing it cool because of a
shoulder injury, lost three yards
for the Gold team. -

The Blues were led by Dave Jan-

asek (6-31). Don Siegel (7-35i.
Steve Murphy (5-271. Stan Os-
trow (6-1b'i. and Bill Daniels (9-
21i.

it was more the combined per-
formance of all the runners. rath-
er than the individual perform-
ance of Cecconi that .loonied
larger in DePasqua's decision to
keep the wishbone.

“I was extremely pleasd with
the results of the wishbone,” De-
Pasqua said after the game. “We
are definitely committed to it for
the fall. We have the quarterbacks
to operate it and sufficient speed
to make it go. Our players also
like it andare sold on it.”

DePasqua’s decision sets the
stage for new look for the Pan-
ther squad next year. The new
look may also ental a former de—.
fensive back as one of the three
running backs. A lot of football
fans are liable to become sold on
a son—of—an-offensive-co-ordinator.

What wouldyou call enormous?

In 1970, Fort-une’s Top 500 iiidus-
trial corporations realized an average

proﬁt of about 4 cents on _
the dollar.
General Electric fared
- slightly better than
average. Last year,
our proﬁts amount-
ed to about 5 cents
on the dollar.

We are occasion-
ally attacked, along
with business in
general, as being
“tooproﬁt-oriented.”

People argue that if social progress

is to be made, business must make it.

And that proﬁts stand in the way of
. social progress. ' 3 1

We would argue quite the opposite.

Thebusiness of business is not just

’ The purpose of a busi- \ ,
ness, as we see it, is to pro- ‘
du’ce and /distribute
necessary goods and serv- . /'
ices to the proﬁt of society
. . . and the business itself.

" Ail business must re-

ing funds.

How much
proﬁt is enough to
keep a business
op-erating? How
much is too much?"
It’s hard to say.

However, the
companies mak-
ing only marginal
proﬁt are not the
companies provid-

ing new employment, creating new
products or adding to in-an’s scientiﬁc

and technical knowledge.

Marginal companies are not the
ones making the important‘ social con-
tributions today. Fora simple reason.

They can’t afford to.

No responsible company wants a
return to the days of the robber bar-
ons. N o. responsible ‘ company wants
“enormous” proﬁts. But‘no company
can survive without the proﬁt system.

Why are we running this ad?‘
General Electricis a big, techno- ’

logical company, with the capabilities
to do a great dealof problem solving

in this country.

We think proﬁts have a direct
‘ effect on our ability to..solve
problems. But we realize the is-
sue of proﬁts is one with two
sides. By telling you our ‘side,

we hope we’\‘e moved you to -
