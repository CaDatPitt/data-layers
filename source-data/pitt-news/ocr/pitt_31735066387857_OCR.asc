Casey slashes budget, university loses $5.5 million

By Jenifer Crook
sum‘ Writer

Facing the loss of more than $5.5 million
in state aid this year because of Gov.
Robert Casey’s proposed spending cuts,
Pitt officials must now decide where to
tighten the university’s already strained
fiscal belt. —

In a statement released yesterday, Pitt
President Wesley Posvar assured the
campus community that no reductions
will be made in individual salaries or

‘5’student aid. “We shall look primarily at
one—time options for reductions,” he said.
Expenditures such as new equipment,
repairs and renovations, and funds from

vacancies such as resignations and retire-
ments are candidates for the reductions.

“We will do everything possible to avoid
layoffs,” Posvar added.

Announced Monday, Casey’s plan
slashes aid to all colleges and universities
by 3.5 percent. The governor’s proposal
also seeks a 50-percent cut in the state’s
tuition—challenge program, which provides

additional state funding to institutions
keeping tuition increases below 6 percent
or $100 per student.

According to Pitt Provost Donald
Henderson, the cuts could affect students
through higher tuition, as Pitt may not be
able to keep tuition increases beneath the
program's cap.

“It's going to hurt students, but maybe
people will tell the governor to stop
playing games,” he said. Henderson added
that Casey could have tackled the fiscal
crisis without reducing education funding.

“He has not spoken about a tax increase,
and the surest source for income revenue
is, of course, taxes.”

Henderson claimed that the Casey

administration knew about but gave no
warning of the cuts before the November
elections. “Frankly, the Casey people lied,”
he said, adding that Casey’s opponent,
Barbara Hafer, had revealed the budget
shortfall, “but nobody believed her.” ,
Although Henderson said that the
university had anticipated budget cuts for
future years, “this one cut us up a little
short. I don’t think we really expected that
we would have to cut our current budgets.”
Casey’s proposed cuts are expected to
produce $731 million for the state, which
faces a deficit that may exceed $1 billion.
Pitt’s reductions must be implemented by
June 30, the end of the current fiscal year.

Academic achievement, social
awareness, leadership qualities
and athletic ability have qualiﬁed
a Pitt student for a Rhodes
scholarship.

Nathan Urban, a senior at Pitt
and a native of Dublin, Ohio, has
been named a Rhodes Scholar
for his excellence in mind and
academic achievement. ‘The
scholarship, presented annually
to 32 American students, includes
the cost of tuition at Oxford
University in England and a
stipend.

The Rhodes scholarship is the
legacy of Cecil J. Rhodes, who
died in 1902. Since Rhodes had
no heirs, his will specified that
the money he left behind be used
to send students to Oxford
University. -

“[Urbanl is a student of great
intellectual breadth and
outstanding academic
achievement. He is one of the
university’s Chancellor’s Scholars
and has been active in both
academic and independent study
and research.

“The Chancellor’s Scholarship
is presented to students with great
academic promise. Nathan was
one of eight students to receive
the award his freshman year. He

also helped to found Students
Against Racism at Pitt. He is a
totally deserving student,” Alex
Stewart, dean of Pitt’s Honors
College and the institutional
Rhodes representative, said.

A triple major in behavioral
neuroscience, philosophy and
mathematics, Urban plans to study
the foundations of mathematics
at Oxford and return to the United
States to pursue a doctorate in the
emerging ﬁeld of computational
neuroscience.

The selection process for the
Rhodes scholarship seeks leaders
who will offer service to the world
in the future. Urban’s academic
record, faculty recommendations
and a personal essay qualified
him for one of the scholarships.

“This scholarship is highly
competitive and merit—based. It is
the most prestigious
undergraduate scholarship that a
student can earn,” Stewart said.

“In September I started writing
the essay,” Urban said. ‘‘I also got
seven recommendations from Pitt
faculty. At the state and regional
interviews we discussed what we
did or didn’t write in the essays.

“They look for evidence of
intellectual ability, evidence of
leadership, evidence that you are
socially committed and evidence
of athletic ability. They look for

Law professor litigates Congressional suit against Bush

By Debbie Lincoln
Stat)" Writer

University of Pittsburgh School
of Law Professor Jules Lobel,
formerly a full-time litigator,
returned to the courtroom last
month to plead in behalf of 54
Democratic members of
Congress.

The suit, which was heard in a
Washington, D.C., federal district

court, requested that the president
of the United States be required
to seek congressional approval
before engaging U.S. troops in an’
offensive military action.
“Before the president can
launch a war against Iraq, he
must first go to Congress and get
their explicit authority. That’s
what our Constitution requires,”
said Lobel. “That system was
designed to chain the dogs of

war.”

-* A decision handed down on
Dec. 13 said that war was not yet
an imminent possibility, but the
judge kept jurisdiction on the
case, allowing him to hand down
a verdict based on developing
conditions.

Once a counselor for a New
York law firm, Lobel acquired
the position of chief litigator of
the case when a California senator

approached the Center for
Congressional Rights for legal
representation. Lobel, who is an
attorney as well as a member of
the CCR Board of Trustees,
accepted the post because he
believes that the president’s
position is inconsistent with basic
constitutional democracy.

“The president has said
continuously that he will consult
with Congress Given their

disagreement, he is not likely to
come back to them for
authorization,” said Lobel.
According to Lobel, there are
strong judicial precedents in the
court which questions presidential
authority to commit U.S. troops to
offensive action without
Congress’s permission. “What is
unique is the situation where the
president has so publicly

Libraries get $ 750, 000for acquisitions budget

By Ross Pasquale
Sta_[f Writer

_ Paul Kobulnicky, director of
the University Library System, has
asked for and received $750,000
for the library system’s budget
next year.

This money is strictly for the
acquisitions budget of the system,
whic-h primarily funds the
subscriptions to the
approximately 20,000 periodicals
that can be found in the
university’s libraries, according
to Kobulnicky.

“We're looking at an average
rate of increase of about 20

. percent for those [magazines and

journals]. $750,000 represents a
1S—percent increase in. our
acquisitions budget. Fifteen
percent may not cover it, but it’s
going to help. This is only to
keep us up with inﬂation, so we
can decide what we should keep
and cut in a more rational way,”
Kobulnicky said.

Although there are various
vacancies within his staff,

Kobulnicky does not see them
being ﬁlled because of a shortfall
in the budget. However,
Kobulnicky maintains that the
university’s libraries do provide
adequate service to students.

I “The services [the students
receive] are the best we can be
giving right now. There has
always been a clamor for more
library hours; there are very few
places on this campus for students
to study. One of the primary

' places on campus for students to

hang out and sort of study is the
first ﬂoor of Hillman Library,” he
said.

He admitted that the first floor
of Hillman Library can get noisy
and would like to see this situation
resolved. Extra hours are
unrealistic at this time because of
the amount of money needed for
the staffing and utilities required

to keep Hillman open longer.

than it is now, he said.
Kobulnicky was promoted to
director of the University Library
System in September. He was
formerly associated with the

physical—science libraries.
Kobulnicky oversees all university
libraries with the exception of
the law, medicine and Western
Psychiatric Institute & Clinic
libraries and has been affiliated
with the university since 1969.
Associate Provost Elizabeth
Baranger is very positive about
Kobulnicky’s leadership as well
as the 15-percent increase in the
system’s budget.

Kobulnicky noted the highly
capable staff of librarians with
broad backgrounds and the
unique services provided as some
of the system’s strengths. One of
the system’s policies is to grant
students three free searches on
any database, a policy he terms
“extremely liberal.”

At some schools, students must
pay a price for these services, he
said. Students can also conduct
literature searches via the Infotrac
system and utilize microfilm
cassettes to copy pertinent articles.

One of the premier pieces of
the system’s colleaions, according
to Kobulnicky, is the world-

 A day in the life...

From painting to protest: a look at activist Vince Eirene

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

I read the news today oh boy/
About a lucky man who made
the grade
—John Lennon
and Paul McCartney

During the 8:00 a.m. Mass at St.
Paul’s Cathedral a variety -of
people come to find some
comfort or strength from God.
Businessmen, students, mothers
with children and solitary elderly
people worship here as one
group. Here also, starting his
day, is Vince Eirene, a local
activist.

Eirene comes here seeking
strength to inspire people to
change the faults of the world.

Apathy toward the homeless,

‘r e troops inlraq and the

militarization of college campuses
concern‘ him._ This last example
refers to the So_f_tware,E,nginee'ring
Institute, which7belongs to
Carnegie Mellon  sponsored
by the U.S. Defense Department
via the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.

From St. Paul's, Eirene crosses
Fifth Avenue to stand and pray at
SE1. 7

The building stands directly
across the street from St. Paul’s
Cathedral; the cathedral’s
reﬂection can be seen in the glass
panes of SEI. However, the
reﬂection of the church; which is
a symbol of good to Eirene, is the
only good thing about SEI.

“The church represents love
and goodness in our world. Yet
right across from it we have evil,”
Eirene says, “an evil that takes the
form of defense research, which
is being done to find better ways
of killing people.”

Eirene, wearing a black T-shirt

“that says “Divest in War,” stands

at SE1 for half an hour. In that
time he prays for the day that will
mark the end of this building.

- Then he leaves for Carnegie

Mellon.

While driving over, he
comments on the red ribbon tied
to the radio antenna of his blue
1978 Chevette.

“Some people tie white ribbons
to their radio antennae to protest
pornography. I tie the red one on
to celebrate our sensuality.”

At CM, Eirene takes out a stack
of sheets, each of which says
“Stop the War” in big, bold letters,
and a roll of tape. He leaves the
car unlocked and starts to tape
his signs to the nearest telephone
pole, which is already‘ covered
with ads for various concerts and
events in Pittsburgh. Then, he
starts across the CM campus to
hang more signs, in what he calls
his “sign—hanging mode,” which
entails takingbig, quick steps so
that he can hang his signs rapidly.

' Upon entering the art building,
Eirene explains the purpose of
the signs. _  ., 1 :

“It’s a quick, message -— a

reminder that troops

are in danger in Iraq and that
they .s.hou1,d be .pu11.ed.ou.t .b.ef0_re
someone gets hurt,” Eirene says
as he tapes a sign on the wall.
Eirene says that he does this once
a week, and when he is done, he

leaves for his next stop, which is 7

Kinko’s on Forbes Avenue.

“I need to make copies of the
pamphlet that will be going to
several different cities to inform
people about the militarization
of {CM} by the existence of SE1,”
Eirene says.

Eirene, who wrote the
pamphlet, talks of his experiences
when protesting the existence of
SE1 and his subsequent treatment
by the authorities. The pamphlet
is entitled “The Militarization of
College Campuses” and will be
sent out soon to cities throughout
thecountry.

Next, Eireneneeds to pick up
food for his homeless shelter,
Dunken and Porter House on the
North Side.

“The name Dunken and Porter
comes from two names we found

renovated the home,” Eirene says.

The firestone makes the base
for a fireplace; it is hidden from
view by the other stones. By
“we,” Eirene is referring to his
friends, who are artists, poets
and other creative people. He
says that Dunken and Porter were
two stonemasons who lived at
the turn of the century and whose
hidden firestone has become the
cornerstone of Dunken and
Porter. W

In _Eirene’s opinion, this once-

iuseless stone‘ now symbolizes
the homeless, who are considered
"useless by our society.

Eirene stops at the Jubilee

..K_itchen, ,where,he gets.free food .

for his shelter. In 1977 he and a
friend started this kitchen, with
its long tables and retiree
proprietors who now make and

serve the meals each day.
"When the Catholic Church
came in to help, I just let them
take over, but they still supply
me with food for Dunken and
Porter,” Eirene says. “All the food
is donated by the Strip District
and is, of course, free.”
Then'Eirene travels across town
to paint the inside of a house.
“This is how my friends and I
raise money to keep Dunken

and Porter running,” Eirene says. I

“We have two businesses. The
first one_is our moving business,
‘Second Mile Light Ha‘giihg,* and
the second is ‘Jacob and Joseph
Painting Co.”’ ' ‘

. ..Eirene says -that the --“name

comes fromJacob with his ladder
andJoseph with his coat of many
colors, both of whom are Biblical
figures from the Old Testament..

The house Eirene and his
friends are working on is a two-
level home with a long row of
stone steps leading up to the
front porch. The downstairs has
been renovated and has bright
yellow walls with white
baseboards. Eirene goes upstairs
and starts to fill in the cracks on
the wall with spackle.

“The New Testament has a
passage that says, ‘Stop being a
thief, and start working with your
hands.’ I enjoy this work because
it allows me to use my hands and
appreciate the work that so many
people do and do not get credit
for,” Eirene says as he puts
spackle into a crack.

As it is nearing suppertime
Eirene heads back to Dunken
and Porter for dinner. The inner
door is open, and he wipes his
feet as he opens the screen door.

He steps on the hardwood floor 5
and makes his way back to the 1

A large number of Pitt students who are
concerned about the quality of care
provided by the Student Health Service at
Pitt do not realize that there is an on-
campus organization willing to help them
with their problems. That organization is
the Student Health Advisory Board.

The Student Health Advisory Board is
“the connecting link between students
and Student Health,” said SHAB president
Mary Wyandt. Students can use SHAB as
a way to handle problems they have with
university health services or to voice their

comments about the quality of service
they receive.

Most students are unaware of_ the the
presence of the SHAB because they make
the mistake of “thinking [SHAB is] a part of
student health,” said Wyandt. She said
getting students to realize that “ISHAB is]
a recognized, independent organization”
is a top priority.

According to Wyandt, most of the
complaints SHAB handles are from students
who think they had to wait too long to be
seen at the Student Health Service.

“Waiting time is limited by [the small]
space” allotted for student health at Pitt,
said Wyandt.

4 ' ’ THE PIT!‘ NEW 5. W¢dne5d3Ys J3n“3l'Y 9, 1991
 

SHAB handles complaints about university health service

She described the size of the student-
health office as “pathetic,” and said that
there aren’t more complaints because of
an “incredible staff that works well,
considering the constraints.”

Wyandt was quick to add that students
share the blame for long waits. “A majority
of the students do not have appointments,”
she said. It is difficult, according to Wyandt,
for students to realize that they Will be
helped after those who have made
appointments. In addition to not making
appointments :1 large number of students
do not show up for scheduled
appointments.

Educating the university community is

another one of SHAB’s jobs. The board
sponsors an annual Health Day, in addition
to sponsoring guest speakers who help
Pitt students understand the importance
of healthy habits.

SHAB members are currently putting
together a campus—safety pamphlet that
will provide safety tips for students. Self.
defense and traffic safety will be among
the issues addressed in the pamphlet.

One of the problems facing SHAB is the
need for a diverse membership. Wyandt

said most of the students who join SHAB _t

are geared toward health professions. She
stressed that SHAB “is open to anyone
who has paid the student health fee.”

all of your strengths,” Urban
said.

Urban said that athletic
ability used to weigh heavily
in‘ determining scholarship
winners, but physical vigor is
more important now. “If
you’re in lousy shape it may
hinder you. They look for
strengths in all areas,” he said.

Urban, who has done a lot
of research in his majors, wrote
about how the fields he is
studying are interrelated and
why he wanted to attend
Oxford. He has also worked

on a recruiting program which
seeks to encourage aca-
demically motivated students
to come to Pitt.

After obtaining his doctorate
Urban said that he plans to
remain in academia. “I’m
interested in what hasn’t been
done in the field. My interests
lie in the research realm,”
Urban said.

Two other students from Pitt
have been named as Rhodes
scholars since 1983: David
Fredrick and Donna Roberts.
Pitt President Wesley Posvar
also holds this honor.

 
 

Congress

threatened war and yet has not
sought congressional approval,”
he said.

The position of the White
House on the subject is that a
congressional role in such a crisis
comes after troops have been
committed to ensure more
freedom in decision—making. But
Lobel said, “The best time for the
American people to debate
whether or not to go to war is
before the war begins and not
while it’s going on.”

“On the law, Lobel has a very

strong case,” said Pitt law
Professor John Burkoff. “The
Constitution would appear to be

relatively clear that Congress has
a role in declaring a war, but
what isn’t exactly clear is what
that role is.”

Although this conflict came up
during the Vietnam crisis, the
judicial branch is often reluctant
to deal with it, according to
Burkoff. “What traditionally
happens is that judges avoid
answering these questions,” he
said. It is a possibility that the
judge may give in to public and
political pressure and rule in favor
of the president, a move that may
ultimately decide American
foreign policy, said Burkoff.

In the nuclear age many
Americans have been reluctant

 

to second-guess the president or
to withhold support for American
troops stationed overseas because
of the lack of information available
to the public. Burkoff said, “We
know in advance what the
situation is  It’s really a question
of who’s supposed to decide.”

The patriotic concerns
surrounding the issue as well as
the sense of urgency with the Jan.
15 deadline have complicated
the issue. “Not many people
would have the courage to litigate
this,” said Burkoff.

However, Lobel said, ‘‘If this
Case isn’t suitable for judicial
review, what case involving war
powers will be?”

Dorm students complain about Towers’ elevator service

By Renee Crespy
S,tajfW7r1'ter

For students living in the
Towers and in a msh to get to
class, the best bet is to take the
stairs. According to several

students, the elevators are not

efficient enough for the number
of people that use them.

Kevin Volk and Matt Zatko,
two Towers residents, feel that
the elevator system needs some
improving.

“It’s ridiculous when you have

to wait 10 or 15 minutes for an
elevator when you're in a hurry
to get to class. I think they should
get new elevators that are quicker
and more efficient and that don’t
break down as much,” said Zatko.

“They should have more
elevators for the [number] of
people using them. I wonder
what the engineers were thinking
when they put only three elevators
in forthis [number] of people,”
said Volk. _

Bob Robinson, associate
director of Housing and Food

Services, doesn’t think there is a
problem with the elevators. “We
don’t have problems or break-
downs on a daily basis, but when
we do, we have elevator re-
pairmen on call all day long and
for emergencies,” said Robinson.
“When you have equipment
that runs 12 or 16 hours straight,
you're bound to have problems,
but most of the major problems
come from abuse,” said Robinson.
According to Robinson, most
of the problems with the elevators
arise from student vandalism.

“There is a very high density of
people in the Towers, and when
there is waiting, people tend to
get frustrated and try to overload
or pry the doors open. It’s really
a matter of so many people using
the elevators at one time,” he
said.

“There have been a few
instances when people got stuck.
When it’s a mechanical problem,
we shut the system down for
about 20 minutes and it’s OK, but
when it gets stuck due to
vandalism, it takes much longer,”

said Robinson. .
Brian Zielinski, another Towers
resident, feels that there really
isn’t much of a problem, but he
does wish there were more
elevators running. Other students
feel that bigger or more elevators
would solve some of the
problems, but according to
Robinson, that just isn’t possible.
“It’s not possible given the
structure of the building. It simply

could not be done, but I think  

currently we have a good system,”
he said.

Henderson also acknowledged
that increased tuition could result
in decreased student enrollment.
He cited this year’s decline in
enrollment at the College of

General Studies following the
school’s 10 percent increaseiin
tuition as a possible example.
In determining specific
reductions, Posvar said that he

Rod Snyder, spokesman for
Casey’s budget office, said that
while Casey’s commitment to
education has not waned, the
national recession has made it
necessary for all recipients of
state funding to tighten theirbelts.

“All of the state universities

and state-related [institutions]
receive a large amount of state
funding every year, and we’ve
been very generous in the times
when we’ve had additional
revenues and the economy was
good. Now that we're being
affected by a tightening economy,
it’s time that everyone has to
tighten up also,” said Snyder.
Henderson disagreed. ‘‘I think

I‘ was actually happy to return to
'Pitt after our holiday break. I was
ﬁlled with the holiday spirit, home
cooking and a renewed sense of
vigor from a well-deserved rest.

I knew that realistically this will
be my last semester, and I was
more than anxious to get it out of
the way. I wasn’t thrilled at the
prospect of being an unemployed
college graduate, but somehow
just being finished at this institution
was enough incentive.

I say I was happy because once
back at school I realized all of the
“wonderful” attributes of Oakland
and college life that I had missed
while I was away: the long lines,
the obnoxious crowds, the sense-
less waste of my hard-earned
money—— all part of the experience
we call a college education.

My excitement of finally gradu-
ating had slowly been sucked up
into this void ofa campus and been

Reing to

filled with th impending doom of
failure and the realization that I“

spent the last four years of my life
struggling like hell and spending
thousands of dollars to receive a
piece of paper with the Pitt logo on
it that I’m convinced will probably
guarantee me a spot in the unem-
ployment line.

I understand that this isn’t com-
pletely the university’s fault (sure,
there’s a recession, and the entire
world is basically in a shambles),
but more and more I’m starting to

believe that I’ve been pulled into
the sham of higher education.

Society perpetuates it! We grow
up being force-fed the belief that a
college education is the only way
to achieve success. Everyone al-
ways says, “You have to go to
college if you want a decent job.”
Well, where are all these schmuck
soothsayers when it’s time to hire
young college graduates?

But I shouldn’t worry. As of Jan.
15, myself, along with thousands
of other college students I share

the same predicament with, may
very well have promising careers
in the military. (There will be no
college deferment from the draft)
Thanks to President Bush's fore-
sight into the current recession,
we’ll all have something to keep
ourselves busy‘ with. Everyone
knows that war stimulates the
economy!

I guess the situation in the Middle
East couldn’t have come at a better
time, although it will interfere with
my graduation. They’ve got sun,
sand, wonderful weather, free
clothes and food,,all the water you
can drink and your very own gun.
I wouldn’t think of it as a job,——- just
an all-expenses-paid graduation trip
from the U.S. government. Maybe
they’d even repay my loans for me!

editor of The Pitt News .

Israel to blozmefor crisis in tbe Middle East

President Bush, with his mili-

‘ tary- and profit-motivated coun-

terparts, must labor to invent jus-
tification for resorting to war with
Iraq. Special television programs
are designed to f ostcr an aggressive
mentality, while a conflict scenario
is ripened for Americans to swal-
low.

Those with powerful inﬂuence
in our government that are oper-
ating in behalf of Israel would like
to see the Palestinian cause crushed
without expending the billions
[Israel] already reaps from Ameri-
can taxpayers and without sacri-
ficing Jewish soldiers. Riding on
the coattails ofAmerican oil inter-
ests are those engaged in covert
motives that utilize American sol-
diers to do their dirty work for
them.

Besides Syria, Iraq presents a

, direct deterrent to Israeli expan-

sionism. Of course cheap oil is
desirable, but if a small country
was doing to the American
economy what Kuwait was doing
to Iraq, we would have blown
them off the map.

The American people know in
theirheartsourmilitaryinvolvement
is wrong, just as they should realize
that Israel is the real criminal in the
Middle East.

Get on with attack

There are several issues which-

are commonly blurred together in
current discussions of a possible
Iraqi-American war. One is, did
President Bush use necessary
prudence before the Iraqi occu-
pation of Kuwait, necessary to
forstall the present mess? Secondly,
are we right to be prepared to
effectively level into a parking lot
the region of Basra to Kuwait City?
I argue that the questions have to
be separated. It would be, from a
military and security standpoint,
suicidally dangerous topress for a
unilateral American withdrawal
under the present circumstances.
Unfortunately, we are probably
going to be stuck with a 10-day to
two-week “killing ground”conﬂict
which no one wants. If the job has

to be done, let’s get it over with
quickly.

Afterwards, suitable investig_a—
tions into the origins of this foreign-
policy fiasco are a must. I for one
think no avenues for investigation
should be cut off and that the
ﬁnancial health of the United States
depends upon a thorough investi-
gation. —

Until the time is ready for such"
investigations to work, I think that
the two issues ‘must by separated.
Once a disaster has occurred, it is
no time to be accessing the niceties
of armchair-vantage strategy mak-
ing when over 70,000 American
soldiers are now in deadly peril for
their lives.

U.S. will cause genocide

I appreciated your coverage of
the anti-war protests in the Tues-
day, Dec. 4 issue. It is alarming to
me that many people would think
that to reverse an oil price increase
is a reason to use military force. I
have heard for years that the United
States, with British encouragement,
would embark on resource grabs
from the Third World, causing
genocide 100 times worse than
Hitler’s. Now I see it happening

Support Operation Postcard
On Sept 21, 1990, the faculty
council of the [Pitt] School of
Education passed a resolution con-
demning the U.S. presence in Saudi

. Arabia. ’

On Oct. 25, 1990, in 7bePittNews,
Rob Lewis presented the complete
text for the ediﬁcation of the stu-
dents who had not read it in its
entirety, along with his interjected
comments of disagreement.

This letter is not to dissect any
interjections but to ‘present a bal-
ance for those who are in agreement
with the council and a peaceful
diplomatic solution in the Persian
Gulf over a bloody and destructive
war. * ‘

Harassing council members and
_“putting a little fear of the 1960s

into them” might appeal tosome _

people, but other people might
like to contact President ‘Bush and
let him know that they are against
his beliefs and actions in the
Persian Gulf. Perhaps President
Bush needs to be confronted with
that reality.

That’s why I started “Operation
Postcard” to balance “Operation
Desert Shield.” We know where
President Bush stands, and now
you .can tell him where you stand.

By sending a postcard to Presi-
dent Bush at Kennebunkport,
Maine, 04643, you can bring your
feelings to his doorstep. President
Bush has brought his feelings to
your doorstep.

If you live in an Oakland apart-
ment, then you are probably familiar
with some of the problems that
exist in many of the apartments
here. Maybe your water is fre-
quently brown. Perhaps your heat
doesn't always come on. Maybe
you even have mice living in your
closet.

In myone and a half years. at Pitt,
I have heard and read about nu-
merous complaints that Oakland
tenants have made against their
landlords. In the majority of these
cases, the tenants stated that in
order to improve the housing
conditions in Oakland, the gov-
ernment must get involved.

I find this very ironic because
government involvement in hous-
ing actually caused the problems
in the first place.

' The government activity to which
I am referring is zoning. Simply
stated, zoning is a policy by which
local governments decide what kind
of structures can and cannot be
constructed on a particular piece
of land, even if the land is privately
owned.’ Zoning prevents the sup-
ply of housing from being as large
as it would be otherwise. Because
of this, there is very little compe-

tition in the housing market, and
poor quality is the result.

The city of Pittsburgh has zoning
laws. In fact, except for Houston,
Texas, every major city in the United
States has some type of zoning
regulations.

During the early 1980s there was
a large boom in the oil industry in
Houston, and the population in
that city was increasing. Develop-
ers responded by constructing a
huge amount of new housing. For
example, in 1982 alone a whopping
60,000 housing units were con-
structed.

Pittsburgh could learn a lesson from Houston

percent of the apartment units in
Houston have been vacant at any
given time. ,“For rent” signs are
everywhere. Landlords are des-
perate to attract tenants. In order to
do so, they keep their apartments
in very good condition. If you live
in Houston and don’t like the way
your landlord is running your
apartment, you can find another
apartment rather easily. Even when
the population of Houston was
rising, as it was during the early
1980s, there was never any trouble
finding good housing there.

The city of Pittsburgh determines
the zoning for the Oakland area. If
zoning were abolished in Oakland,
there would be a tremendous
amount of new construction. As
the supply of housing increases, so
would the competition among
landlords to attract tenants. There
would soon be a tremendous in-
crease in the quality of housing in
Oakland. \ V

I have heard some people say
that even if zoning were abolished
in Oakland, there would be very

little new construction because-

there is almost no room for it. But
this is not true because just as
housing can be built,‘it can also be

Jeﬂ’ Kloiber (top) carne up big against ASU's Kelly Gonzalas last night scoring a 5-1 victory in the 190 pound Weight class.

The Arizona Sun Devils came east last night and
added a chill to the already freezing weather. And
the fourth~ranked Sun Devils will head back to the
Valley of the Sun hotter than ever on the heels of
a 25-11 victory at the expense of the Pitt Panthers.

In their first dual meet of the season the Panthers

.managed only three victories and one tie, while
Arizona State improved to 6-0. The three Victories
were achieved by freshman Chad Pines, junior
Scott Hovan and freshmanJeffKloiber, while the tie
was registered by junior Perry Miller.

The most exciting match of the evening occurred
at the 150—pound weight class, where Pines locked
up with Arizona State junior Sean Griswold. The
match teetered back and forth while both men
exchanged takedowns and escapes. The match was
further intensified when Pines had to take two C
injury timeouts to clear his head. Finally, he was
able to gain control and go on to win, raising his
record to 2—5 while Griswold fell to 0—7.

Immediately following the Pines match was the
158—pound weight class, where Pitt was represented
by fourth-ranked Hovan. Hovan started off strongly
against freshman Gary Witherspoon. He scored

two early takedowns and was able to hold off a late

Freshman Pines overcomes illness, scores key win

By Bob Maselli
Staff W1*iter

The Panther wrestling squad
had a few shining spots last night
in its loss to Arizona State,
especially from freshman Chad
Pines. Pines came through with a
victory that was nothing short of
raw determination.

Pines was called to wrestle in
the 150—pound weight division,
even though he has been battling
an illness for the past week and
as of last night was overweight.

“I’ve had a sinus infection and
strep throat for the past week. I
was five pounds over last night,
and I had to lose it. I also had a
fever, so I wasn’t sure I could
wrestle,” said a tired Pines after
his match. The program
had Pines and Dave Kelly both
listed to wrestle. “But Coach
[Stottlemyerl said he really would
like to have me wrestle, and I
went in,” said Pines.

Welcome back one and all from
a well-earned and entirely too
short vacation! While all of us
were either relaxing at home,
working or basking in a favorite
vacation spot, the sports world
was busy producing its usual
myriad of spectacular and inane
events.

- In Syracuse, N. Y., the Syracuse
P0st—Stcmdarcl reported possible
NCAA violations involving the
Orangeman basketball team in
December. What happened after
that, you ask? No less than 200
people cancelled their
subscriptions to the paper (as
was reported yesterday in 'I79ePitt
News), saying the Post-Standard
had no right to uncover such
allegations. Better yet, readers
have complained that such
investigations should be left to

“I was feeling good when it
came time to get in there, and I

wasn’t worried about their No. 3
ranking. It really pumped me
up,” he added.

Pines came into the match and
from the start made it clear that
his opponent, Sean Griswold, was
in trouble. He moved around
well on the mat and showed no
real signs of fatigue until halfway
through the second period.

All was going well until Pines
took an elbow to the head and
lay almost motionless on the mat
until the referee stopped play.

“I started to feel a little sick, and
then I got hit,” said Pines, who
took an injury timeout and was
attended to by the Pitt trainers.

After the stoppage in play Pines
rode out the second period and
was starting to slow down. Then
he went down again, holding his
forehead.

See Pines, page 12

Illustrated and The Washington
Post.

On top of that silliness, Tbe
Heraldjoumal, the town’s other
paper, which had nothing to do
with the original story, received
its own batch of53 cancellations,
according to Post-Standard
reporter Kevin Harmon.

That must be one sick town to
live in. Anyone to whom the
words “violation” and “collegiate
sports” in the same sentence come
as a surprise, is sick. God forbid
that some intrepid journalists
uncover possible violations of
the ever—sacred Orange basketball
program! (You mean college
athletics may be sometimes
corrupt?)

cancelled their subscriptions to a
newspaper are still living in

that walked onto the field looked
like moving collages because of

favorites: Florida State in the
Blockbuster Bowl. The Seminoles
had that oh~so~attractive
“Blockbuster Bowl” patch on their
shoulders; little, black tomahawks
on their helmets in addition to
the already prominent red and

surge by Witherspoon to win 7-4.

The victory raised Hovan’s
overall record to 7-2 while
dropping Witherspoon to 7-4.
Hovan reﬂected on his match: “I
would have liked to score more
points. I spent too much time
trying to make the big move
instead of taking it one takedown
at a time. We could have won this
match, but we weren’t sharp.”

Another exciting contest
occurred at the 167-pound level,
when Pittsburgh sophomore Sean
Gibbs (7-4) met up with Rob
Holland. The match remained
scoreless for the first two periods,
as both men struggled for an
edge. The only points were scored
by Holland when with less than
one minute remaining, he was
able to gain an advantage and
score a takedown. Gibbs fought
tough in an attempt to even the
score, but he was unable to and
fell 2-0.

match for most of the time and

the two heavyweights met in a
grueling battle. Pittsburgh’s Miller
began strongly against Arizona
State’s Mike Anderson, scoring
on a takedown and two escapes.
Anderson countered late in the
match with two escapes of his

than 15 seconds remaining.
Unbelievably, Anderson was able

The Pitt women’s basketball team evened its
record at 7-7, and raised its Big East record to 2-1,
with an impressive 72-57 victory at Syracuse Monday
night.

Senior forward Lorri Johnson led the team in
scoring (with 26 points), as she has in all but two
games this season, and was second in rebounds
with eight.

Freshman Jonna Huemrich was the team’s top
rebounder with 11 to go along with 21 points.
Center Holly Oslander led Syracuse with 16 points
and seven rebounds.

Pitt outshot (47 percent to 38 percent) and out-
