Jazz opera music added
to Davis’ list of creations

LAURA JERPI
Staff Writer

Jazz, gospel singing and the
church unite two families that share
both love and loss. But as a result
of incest, drug addiction, race riots
and murder, they are torn apart.

Nathan Davis, Pitt’s assistant

professor of music and director of,

jazz studies, composed the music
for the jazz opera“Just Above My
Head,” based on a novel by James
Baldwin.

On Thursday evening, Davis
attended a press conference held to
promote the opera in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom.

Jonathan Eaton, the artistic
director for the Opera Theater of
Pittsburgh, described Davis as “one
of Pittsburgh’s most celebrated
artists.”

He and Davis have worked
together to bring the opera to life
for about a year. V

According to Davis, the most
important thing in creating such a

work is to “have fun —— that comes
first.”

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
who spoke at the event, said he was
not surprised that Davis composed
an opera.

“Nathan [Davis] has always
been one to reach out and attract
new music loVers,” Nordenberg
said. “[Davis] has left his musical
mark wherever he and his work
have traveled.”

Davis composed his opera in
about two years, while touring
Europe in the l960s.

He wrote a little in each country
he visited, and he said the atmos-
pheres of the different countries
gave the opera an exciting touch.

When Davis became a member
of Pitt’s faculty in 1969, he found
himselfiinspired to compose an
opera.

This came partially as a result
of realizing renowned opera singer
Claudia Pinza was on staff at the

Opera, page 7

DAVID J. MCCARTHY/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg joined Pitt Professor Nathan Davis last Thursday night to
publicize the jazz opera “Just Above My Head,” for which Davis composed the music.

remind them to try not to be “modern
day, punked-out Rip Van Winkles.”
“The old men have dreamed the
dream, but the Visions of the youth
are still unrealized, because we have

«visions of bling—bling,” Johnson said.

“How can we liberate Africa

when we can’t even liberate the peo K

ple on our block?” a
Johnson suggested a five-
pronged strategy that he said he felt
social
change.
He urged students to have a
‘fhigher commitment” to challenge

the -things that are wrong in the com-
munity. '

Johnson asked the students to
discover what roles they play,
through the fruitsiof their talents, and
to employ them.

“We need people of all profes-
sions concerned with changing the
political landscape of this country,”
Johnson said.

He told ‘students to create a_strat—
egy and stick to it.

“We have got to create a strategy
that~’s more sophisticated and com-
prehensive,” Johnson said.

“We don’t have to recreate the

wheel. We just need to create a body
that connects [political] soldiers in
Oakland to [political] soldiers in
Newark.”

Johnson instructed the audience
to help convince people to buy into
the mission.

He said that people must begin to
move.

“The only thing that matters is,

what are you all going to do?” _,

Johnson said. “If [King] were alive,
he wouldn’t be dreaming that old
dream. It would have evolved by
now. It would have transcended into
something elselarger.”

King speech

sparks a talk

about “life’s blueprint”

thing.”

After making the packets, the

Jumpstart members, most of whom
were wearing blue Jumpstart T-
shirts, sat at 10 tables throughout
the Kurtzman Room in the William
Pitt Union to take part in a program
of reflection.

Sarah John, a special education

coordinator for the Pennsylvania
Service—Learning Alliance, started
the program by reading part of a
King speech that was originally
given to middle school students in
Philadelphia.

“What is your life’s blueprint?”

the speech began. Just as an archi-
tect needs a blueprint for a building,

so too does a child need a blueprint

for their lives, John quoted King as

saying.
The blueprint of life must be

made up of both a “deep belief in
your own dignity, your own worth”

and a striving for excellence, King
said in his speech. ‘

’ “Set out to do such a good job
that the living, the dead and the
unborn couldn’t have done it bet-

ter,” King said.

It makes no difference if a per-
son is a street sweeper or a poet,
King said. All people in all occupa-
tions must take pride in what they
do and do it the best they can, he
said. J

“How do you feel Jumpstart is
strengthening your blueprint?” John
asked her audience.

Kristopher Branson raised his
hand. “It’s helped me to become a
better person,” he said. “Not that I
was a bad person before,” he added,
causing his fellow Jumpstart mem-
bers to laugh.

Then John asked the members if
they had done the best they possibly
could today, whether they were in
charge of stapling papers or cutting
tissue.‘

Sandi Pino mentioned how
everyone worked together to do
they best they could as a group. She
remembered thinking to herself
when she first walked into the room,
“Oh my God, it looks like a factory
in here.”

And everyone was smiling, she
«said, because they were truly happy
to‘be working to do something for

Jumpstart members also took
part in an activity in which they
labeled the ABCS of Service. The

students at each table composed a

list of what community service
meant to them, using all the letters
of the alphabet. The groups then

voted on the best ones to put on a

on an admissions scale. The practice
has drawn criticism in the past, par-
ticularly in light of Texas A&M’s
decision last month to discontinue
affirmative action practices in admis-
sions.

For any institution to discontinue
affirmative action because it takes
factorspother than academic merit into
account and then continue to grant
preferential treatment to legacies ——
who, after all, are only the beneficia-
ries of an accident of birth — is the
height of hypocrisy. Eliminating pref-
erence for legacies is an idea that’s
time has come.

It’s no secret that, in the past,
more whites than blacks were admit-
ted to most colleges. The idea behind
granting preferential treatment to
legacies is to create a sense of com-
munity, a shared sense of pride and
roots at a school, which is a lovely
notion. The reality of it, though, is
not so rosy.

Each year at Texas A&M, legacy
status had been the deciding factor

for admitting more than 300 white
students while only a very few black
students got in based on legacy status,
according to the Houston Chronicle.
Clearly, preference for legacies per-
petuated the sins of the past.

Admitting a student who may not
have otherwise gotten in to a school
presents a challenge to professors. If
George W. Aggie was admitted with
shaky grades and a family of Texas
A&M students, it seems like a neces-
sity that he passes his classes, regard-
less of his performance, to redeem the
decision the school made in admitting
him.

Universities are businesses, in.
addition to temples of learning. If Mr.
Aggie gets in, poor SAT scores and
all, and then fails out, it’s likely his
family will stop donating those
important private dollars to Texas
A&M. If the school doesn’t accept
him in the first place, they can kiss
his tuition dollars and his potential
alumni donations goodbye.

Acceptance to college based on
any factors‘ other than academic and
personal merits and potential is a
dicey proposal, at best. When one of
those factors happens to be coming
from a family privileged enough to
have gone to college in generations
past, the only result can be elitism
and a sense of entitlement among an
already entitled class of people.

Is he forever condemned to eunuch land?

Dear Sex N’at:

I do realize that this is not as filthy
and perverted an inquiry as your mind
would desire, but it is rather important
to both my friend and myself. Last fall,
before transferring to Pitt, I attended a
small liberal arts college in Ohio. One
of my friends there, known to us as
Castro, had gone out brieﬂy with sev-
eral girls during roughly the first half
of the semester. While he did get
mucho ass during this brief period of
time, he then started to date
a Christian girl who was
more or less dependent on
him to be her source of self-
esteem and as a reliable
source of penis. She would-
n’t bang him, though, and-
made him wear rubbers
when she sucked him off.
Recently, my friend Castro
broke up with this girlfriend
after a petty fight of theirs at
a party. Castro was eager to
be free and be able to. _
bang/hit on random chicks again, but it
being a small liberal arts school,
everyone hears about everything you
do. So, the girls seem to ignore him,
except when they desire entertainment
or a favor from him. Thus, he now
views himself as a eunuch and more or
less tries to ignore girlsl‘ Out of desper-
ation, he’s even joined a porno site and
tried online dating. I’ve tried to help
him, but found it beyond my experi-

ence. So, my dear Melissa, would you ‘

kindly tell us, what is_a eunuch to do?
— Save Eunuch Castro
P.S. I think you’re hot. Sex plz.

Dear SEC:

    

Melissa Meinzer
Opinions Editor

So, your “friend” isn’t getting. any,
and you want my help?

Well, Castro, you clearly aren’t
telling me the whole- story, which is
going to make it harder for me to
advise you. You’re leaving out the
most important part of the story, which
is what your “friend” did to upset this
girl so much that she picked up the
phone to the secret liberal arts girl hbt—
line — because, you know, we have
one of those. Oh yeah, didn’t you
know? Don’t cross a woman who stud-
ies the humanities, or it’s
all engineering and busi-
ness chicks for you from
here on out.

So, it’s a small school
and your “friend” did
something crappy to some
girl, and now he’s not get-
ting any. Your hostility
toward the girl in question
is‘pr_etty obvious from the
start.‘ Oh my, she won’t
put out? Guess what?
' That’s her call, and a

 

respectable one at that. If she’s absti-
nent, then that’s that, and it must be

respected. ‘As far as bagging ol’
Castro’s member before she gulps it,
that would also seem wise, considering
the mucho ass he was getting before
she came along Syphilis of the throat
is no walk in the park.

Rather than cry in his Faygo even
for ‘a minute, that charmer Castro saw
the end of his relationship as a great
thing, a chance for more random
hookups. You say that the girl was
dependent upon him for her self-
e_steem and nookie, which seems about
right, considering that she stayed with
a cretin like him long enough to have
to break up. So maybe she’s less than

THE PITT NEWS

Though I’ve had many interesting
experiences during my years at Pitt,
I have yet to be seduced by a pro-
fessor.

I’ve heard it’s not unusual for
some student-teacher relationships
to take a more hands—on approach,
but I’ve never been able to give it a
setting outside of the ‘60s or
movies starring Jason Biggs.

Apparently, it’s a pretty relevant
topic, though, because many uni-
versities are actually refining their
codes of ethics on th,e..subject.

~ I have no idea what kind of
stance Pitt has taken on the issue —
and I doubt it will affect me much
in any case —— but I don’t think I
can enter a classroom again without
wondering if the teacher has his or
her eye on one of us, and who the
chosen one(s) will be.

I honestly never gave the idea
much thought prior to a few weeks
ago, when I read a Jan. 2 Slate col-
umn written by Northwestern
University professor Laura Kipnis.

I get the impression that she has
long taken her academic work in
directions that must be considered
either edgy or worthless, depending
on who is doing the considering.

Most of her writing seems to
intellectualize topics like pornogra-
phy, and the reviews read like a
script from any number of crappy
VH1 documentaries, talking about
“bravery” and “innovation,” but in
reference to her views on marriage,

instead of about Madonna and how ?

she reinvented herself 80 times._ I '
For Kipnis, student-teacher love

is simply a given, certainly not any-

thing to get up in arms about.
While she never explicitly

' reveals her own experience, her

tone invites assumptions through-
out, and she notes that while male
professors aren’t afraid to cruise the
undergrads, fe’Inale professors tend
to favor the maturity and sophisti-
cation found only in graduate
school.

This is a comforting insight,
allowing me to sleep soundly in the
assurance that it’s my age, and not
my inadequacy, that has kept me out
of the professorscene.

I can’t help but wonder how
something like this gets started. Is it
like in the movies when the beauti-
ful but untamed vixen with parents
who demand overachievement stays
after class to swear she will do any-
thing for an A, and she means any-
thing? '

Or is it more of an intelligence
thing — that ‘man’s mind is sexier
than rock n’ roll.

Or, do students — I’m thinking

. mainly undergrads here — actually

‘ attraction takes a much

carry on meaningful, romantic rela-
tionships with profes-
sors?

Sure, I’d be lying ifl
said I didn’t develop my
own little crushes on a
few brilliant female pro-
fessors over the years.

Heck, you could
probably even throw in a_
male or two (um
ahem).

And I imagine the

stronger hold on female
students, as I’ve heard

 

Eric Miller.

Columnist

they aren’t quite as superficial as
my kind. But I can’t
imagine ever pursuing a
teacher, especially with
all the obstacles and
power struggles that
would come as part of
the package. '

I have to wonder
how often the prospect
of a constantly variable,
well-stocked dating pool
gets mentally noted by
aspiring professors.

Of course none of
them would admit it, and

it couldn’t be a primary motivation.
But how often do they think about it
and smile?

Last year, the University of
California ruled that teachers may
not develop consensual relation-

ships with any student who has an .

interest in their field. In other
words, if you might end up evaluat-
ing him in the classroom, you may
not do so outside of it.

This seems reasonable to me,
but I doubt it will find much appli-
cation. If it’s hard to imagine a stu-
dent pursuing her own teacher, it’s

fully self-‘actualized. But, if this girl is

such a harpie, what does it say about
Castro that they were together?

. Clearly he has no self-esteem issues,

either. Clearly.

So it seems, from the limited 7

amount of information you are willing

to provide, that maybe the problem I

lies more with Castro and less with the
activation of the secret emasculating
hotline. Castro has problems with
women, not the other way around;

You say he’s trying to ignore A in

women, because he doesn’t think he
can get any. News ﬂash! In addition to
a secret “no-sex-for-Castro” signal,
women have the ability to spot a man
who is going to ignore her if he has no
hope of getting in her pants. That’s a
self-fulfilling‘ prophecy. We notice
when you consider sexually unavail-
able women to be nonexistent, and it

, telegraphs your below-the—neck-only

interest in women. We hate that crap,
and we don’t like sleeping with guys
like that.

So how is Castro going to get any?

Well, I’ve never tried online dat-
ing, and I don’t know anyone who has
had any success with it. The porn Web
sites will do great things for his solo
sex life, but won’t help ‘his, caseiirif any
potential eunuch-rescuers find out
about it. I refuse to believe that his
school is so tiny that there are no

women there who didn’t get the memo ‘

about him. a
When I was in high school and in
my perpetually grounded phase, my
momused a "metaphor on me that I
particularly hated, but seems to apply
to 01’ Castro. I was a train that had
derailed, and I needed to get back on
track. The way to get a derailed train
going‘ straight again (or at least the
model ones we had —-—. it’s just a
grounding metaphor, not physics) is to
pull it in reverse and let it try to go for-
ward again. ‘ ~ _ ,
Castro needs to get back to the
very basics of dating. He needs to

become friends with some women,

take them‘ "out on a few expectation-
free dates, and relearn how to be a
man, not a eunuch or a jerk.

P.S. — “Sex plz”? lWhat the hell does
that even mean?

Me_lis.sa Meinzer would be more likely
to respond to a horn honked at her;

Along Came Polly

Starring Ben Stiller, Jennifer
Aniston

Directed by John Hamburg’ -
int:

Ben Stiller’s latest feature ﬁlm contains
more farting than laughter. “Along Came
Polly” is the story of Ruben Felfer ‘(Ben
Stiller), a paranoid guy who just got dumped
by his wife on their honeymoon. It doesn’t
take him long to summon up all his courage
and ask his former middle school classmate
Polly (Jennifer Aniston) out on a date. Polly
is everything Ruben is not. She’s sponta-
neous, doesn’t make commitments and eats
the mixed nuts at a bar. This quirky pair
sounds like a perfect opportunity for
sidesplitting moments, but the ﬁlm’s humor
is mostly ﬂat

nothing original or clever; Plenty of crude
jokes are incorporated throughout the
movie. In fact, Ben Stiller’s character has
Irritable Bowel Syndrome simply for this
purpose. Some of the gags are amusing, but

time. 'Ihe_ best gag is Polly’s blind pet ferret

the movie an extra push in the direction of

funny. Ruben’s friend, the childhood star

turned delusional, middle-aged man, is a
welcome, spastic relief from the straight
humor of Stiller’s character. His advice on

«women, basketball skills and just about any

scene he’s in always has something to laugh
about. Ruben’s neurotic boss adds some
much-needed ﬂavor to the whenever he
shows up. His unique  of leadership
includes slapping Ruben on the butt while

mistress. Ruben’s reckless client is the luck-
iest risk-taker that Ruben has ever encoun-
tered.\His affinity for base-jumping and the

‘ability to pull out a dislodged tooth without

blinking create some pretty funny moments.

The main downfall of the ﬁlm is its pre-
dictability. Ruben and Polly’s unlikely rela-
tionship follows a linear pattern of break-up,
make-up and the obvious other woman
coming back to haunt Ruben. Funny inci-
dents and a couple of small surprises occur
along the way, but eventually the movie
comes to its obvious conclusion. Stiller and

Aniston’s characters complement each

other nicely, although the affection between '

their characters seems strange at times.

“Along Came Polly” is a fairly funny
movie, but does not reach the same level
that some of Stiller’s previous ﬁlms have.
While the premise seems promising, the
movie is simply average and practically
every joke has been done before. A better
bet might be to stay inside and catch a rerun
of “Friends” instead.

Some listeners, however, may ﬁnd that the style
of the music comes off as preachy, especially the
track “Al1 U Can Eat.” The song is a rare moment of

criticism, humbling

the "excessive, SUV-
driving population
with lyrics like

Rockin’ the Suburbs, the music of Ben Folds was
characterized by self-loathing, regret and romances
gone wrong. With his bandmates in Ben Folds Five,
he spoke to a generation of frustrated, confused
youngsters with songs that were both tragic, like
their hit single “Brick,” and tragically funny, like
“Army,” a bouncy song about missed opportunities.
His more recent work, like the hilarious title track
off his solo album, signals a new stage in the musi-
cal career of Folds. While other musicians are still
screaming angrily about how their fathers didn’t hug
them enough, Folds seems to stare the ever—present
Angry White Boy Syndrome in the face, only to
promptly smash it into the ivory keys of his piano.
He continues this stage with his new EP Sunny

departure from lamenting about the wasted days of
his youth to instead focus on lamenting about his
newfound, enlightened maturity. Released in
September of 2003, Sunny 16 is the second in a

A walk down the aisle is just a joke for Spears and ex—hubby

While typing a paper for my class the other
day, I looked down at my hands and noticed how
badly I needed a manicure. Perhaps some French
tips would keep me from biting my nail_s. And then,
I began thinking about how gorgeous a diamond
ring would look on  my right hand.

If you’re anything like my closest friends and
I, you do not — I repeat, do not — wear a diamond
ring on your left ring finger. As a matter of fact,
you do not wear any type of gemstone on your
wedding finger. I consider the act of marriage
sacred, and the day my dad walks me down the
aisle is the day my left ring finger will feel the
touch of platinum.

I don’t know; that’s just me.

Britney Spears is the reason why I’m talking
about that special union, in case you hadn’t
guessed. Perhaps you thought I was just a sucker
for romance and shiny things, but I actually just
love to gossip about what stunt the woman former-
ly known as Mrs. Jason Allen Alexander is going to
pull next.

Yes, I had to go there.

You’ve heard of the lovebirds’ controversy, no
longer pertaining to hottie Justin Timberlake and
Miss Britney Spears. No, Spears has a new man in
her life, or did, at least, for 55 hours, according to
People Weekly and In,Touch magazines. '

What was she thinking? ‘

If she wants to get even more attention, or
Justin back into her life, she’s approaching it the
wrong way. Am I right? Perhaps I should keep this
in mind the next time I want a date. No wedding
garters.

But the question remains. What were Spears’

reasons for
w a 1 k i n g
down the
aisle in Las
Vegas on _. ,: -‘
Sat., Jan. 3‘? 

Did she real-
ly think that

career? —-—-—-——————
W e l l ,

according to her ex-husband and ABC news, the

couple was not under the influence. '
“We were in Las Vegas  we’re sitting in the

[hotel] room and we’re like ‘let’s go do something,

_ let’s go get married,” Alexander told the TV show

Inside Edition. -

Yeah, that’s exactly what I do with my guy
friends when I’m bored. I think.it’d be fun to ~ get
married. H - V,

And according to ABC News, Alexander
claimed that both he and Spears were perfectly
sober when they decided to wed at 5:30 a.m. on
Jan. 3. Am I the only one who _finds that story
absurd? . I

But here’s something I thought I should point
out. April Fool’s Day is still several months away.
Well, I guess the two have an interesting sense of

  

humor. , .

S I pity the next guy who tries to date the woman_

who was already married and divorced in the time
it takes to watch a Real World marathon. He better
know what he’s getting himselfinto. And I feel
rather bad for Alexander. To say you were married
- to Britney while she claimed the entire event was
a joke has to be somewhat embarrassing. Or
maybe the envy of your best, guy friends’ wet
dreams. _ ,

While this news story was a complete shocker

to the entertainment‘ world, a person has to won-

der what Spears’ next moment of irrationality is

going to be. -I v
Perhaps she’ll decide to bring a little Britney
into the world, claiming she didn’t really have a
pregnancy test in her hand while the paparazzi
snapped a picture of her walking out of a corner
drugstore. V
Then, again, maybe she’ll tell the world she’s
the next person lined up to visit the moon. Sound
familiar?’ But “Oops, just kidding,” Spears will say.
This may be a phrase she’ll want to continue to
repeat in the months. ahead, seeing how the stunt
she pulled isn’t working too well in her favor. US
Weekly magazine reported that her joke made her
miss a video shoot for Showtime and bail on a

Seventeen magazine cover. Not to mention that, in '
the week after her wedding, Spears’ CD sales

dropped from 205,000 to a shocking 69,000; ~

Only the weeks ahead for Spears will give her '
fans a preview as to what is in store for her. Until .

then, I guess it’s not a nice day for a white wed-
ding. - I

Courtesy U-Wire: Jackson isn’t the only one living in Never Land

CHRISSY BALZ
The Hoya (Georgetown U.)

(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON — Michael Jackson
isn’t the only middle-aged adult living in Never
Never Land; a 50-year-old man from Tampa, Fla.,
has re-invented himself into a real—life Peter Pan,
green leggings and all. Boasting a pixie—esque
appearance and over 20 outﬁts modeled after those
worn by the never—aging boy, Randy Constan
hopes to find his very own Tinkerbell and inspire
other fairies by displaying his interests on the
Internet at pixyland.org/peterpan/index.htm1.

For Constan, emulating a pixie is a wayjof
life. He has created his own line of elfin clothing;
has made several television appearances and his
award-winning Web site helped raise more than
$1,000 for youth charities last year alone. When
he turned five in 2003 (Constan does not use dou-
ble digits to count his age), he held a Pixie Party,
which drew friends and fans alike. Dancing in a
cloud of bubbles, Constan and his friends celebrat-
ed their eternal youth with costumes, wands and
revelry. In a club that is located at the second star
to the left and straight on until morning, Constan
celebrated half a century, err, decade of youth clad

if in a jungle green polyester tunic, matching leg-A

gings and slippers. ~
Constan’s eclectic wardrobe matches his vari-

ety of interests, including long walks in the
woods, jazz, emotional movies and exploring his I
Christianity. Never to be out-dressed, he has creat-
ed an ensemble for all occasions. Most notable are
his authentic Ultimate Glitter Star Fairy vestige, a
lacey, baby blue, boy tunic inspired by '

‘ Gainsborough and a costume he refers to as the

Purple Pixie.Outfit — sparkly spandex included.

But Constan isn’t just about swordfights and
mermaids; he’s attempting to tackle warped gender
roles in popular culture.

“Unfortunately this society has deified their
gender boundaries, especially the rules of what~
boys should and should not like or do,” he writes.
“This iswhy little girls are praised for interest in
‘boyish’ activities, but boys who do the opposite.
are seldom tolerated.”

Pop culture has long been fascinated with
blurred gender lines and fellow Lost Boys Michael
Jackson, Boy George and Dennis Rodman have
been making feminine masculinity look good since
the early 1980s. Drawing from the increasingly
large amount of fan ‘mail he receives, Constan

hopes to become such an icon that he is able to
both break and recreate social norms.

Constan realizes that it’s a lonely life when
you’re a-little different from other boys.

“Sometimes it has been a difficult and lonely
road to be so openly unique, and I confess I am
often mystified why something so harmless both-
ers some people so,” he admits, yet still remains
optimistic. .“The human spirit is hard to suppress,

and I have made my choice to be true to myself in ’

this life.” . _

While the Pretty in Pink Clubwear may be far
from the attire mainstream America would pick for
a night on the town, it seems like Constan
deserves credit for his unapologetic understanding
of himself. ’ ' ‘

So he’s got the faith and trust. Now all he
needs is a little fairy dust. Ladies, dig out your
tutu and wings, this_Peter Pan is on the prowl for
his Tinkerbell. All youthful glee aside, Constan
makes one point very clear.

“Since I do like to look androgynous, I also-
must clarify that I am only interested in a female
partner.“ a

Sorry, Captain Hook.

Daily O’Collegian (Oklahoma State U.)

(U-WIRE) STILLWATER, Okla.--_

Complilations of a band’s greatest
songs and hits usually signal one of
two things. The first is that the group
on the CD has been around for a con-
siderable length of time. The second
is that a member of said group has
died and the remaining members
wish to profit further from their work
and that of their deceased colleague.

So what do you do when the two
aforementioned reasons don’t apply?
Easy: simply title the album some-
thing as quaint as “The Singles:

1992—2003.” What better way is there
to display a group’s talent and milk
even more money from sales than by
taking all the best tracks off its pre-
vious albums and putting them onto
one CD? There isn’t a better way.
Why should No Doubt be any
different?
V After putting in the time on the
road with grueling tours and. playing
for audiences smaller than a fresh-

man comp class, if there is_anyone .

worthy in music today of an album
like this, it’s definitely No Doubt.
“The Singles ..

gles ‘off’ its previous few albums.

ou’Ve heard these songsbefore

Obviously, No "Doubt fans will
have each of the 15 tracks featured
on their “singles” release. However,
for those who didn’t purchase or
download all of No Doubt’s previous
singles, you can appreciate the qual-
ity in the selection of the tracks- and
the little bit of nostalgia the begin-
ning brings, kicking off with “Just a
Girl.” '

Mixing in some of the old with
some of the new, this album will do
just as well as some of No ‘Doubt’s
other releases, but I wouldn’t expect
any record amount of sales.

But as the liner notes suggest, No

Doubt is somewhat of a ‘‘continual-

phoenix.” Repeatedly coming up
with songs featuring hooks that often
brought back fans and also revived
some of its earlier works, No Doubt
has been able to keep producing hits
for 17 years.

Along with each song comes the
story of its creation. The 34-page
liner notes go into great detail about

each song, with the lyrics on the

opposite page. Photos of the band,
both old and new, are also included
on each page.

Going through the discography

of a band’s career can sometimes be
dangerous, often signaling an end —
No Doubt is an exception. Still going
strong and still creating, writing and
performing great music, the band
will continue on for some time to

come, perhaps producing another_

“The Singles  in another 17 years.

If. you own all the other No
Doubt albums, this one probably
isn’t for you. Including its latest-
released single “It’s My Life” and 14
other hits from No Doubt’s past, this
album is one for those who have
enjoyed the band for the 17 years it
has been around but have yet to pick
up one of its albums. ‘ -

Running just 16 seconds shy of
an hour, No Doubt’s “The Singles
1992-2003” is a testament to whata
group can accomplish with creativity
and hard work.

HARTFORD, Conn. —Antonio Graves
had the opportunity to send the game
between No. 8 Pittsburgh and No. 4
Connecticut into overtime, but his shot
fell inches short, hitting the frontof the
rim, giving the Huskies a 68-65 victory.

But head coach Jamie Dixon still
saw the game as a moral victory.

“I told this team I have never been
more proud of them after they battled
and competed in a great college game,”
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “It hurts
to lose [as a head coach] just as much as
it did to lose as an assistant and as a
player. I know the key now is how we
respond.” ' ’

Even with the Panthers’ first loss -of
the season, this game marked the first
meeting between long—time Connecticut
coach Jim Calhoun and Dixon, Pitt’s
ﬁrst-year coach. As the game played
out, both coaches matched each other
move for move, using each team’s sub-
stitutions and timeouts in order to give
their team the best chance to win.

“[Calhoun] is a legend,” Dixon said.

“Five years ago we looked at UConn to
see how a college program is run.

HARTFORD, Conn. —- In the end, Pitt’s

- '68-65 loss. to No. 4'Connecticut will go

down in the history books like every other _
loss before and after it. '

But this was no ordinary loss.

For starters, it was the Panthers’ ﬁrst
this season, ending what was one of the
best starts to a season in school history.
Pitt’s 18-0 run to begin the campaign was
second only to Doc Car1son’s 1927-28
squad, who went 21-0 and won a national
title.

This was also the ﬁrst loss ofhead

‘ coach Jamie Dixon’s career. The ﬁrst-year

coach now holds the ﬂiird-best start to a
coaching career, bested only by North
Carolina’s Norman Shepard in 1923-24,
who’s team started 26-0, and Bill Hodges
of Indiana State. Hodges’s team began the
1978-79 season 33-0 before losing to
Michigan State in the national champi-
onship game.

'Ihe winniilg Sneak helped propel the

Panthers from the bottom of the top 25 into

the top 10. Pitt now stands at No. 8 in the 9
Associated Press poll and No.9 in the.
coaches’ poll.

Probably the most important thing that
Pitt gained by losing to UConn was what it
hasbeenlooking forall seasonerespect.

By playing all but three of their ﬁrst
18 games in the friendly conﬁnes of the
Petersen Events Center, it was assumed
ﬂiat the Panthers would be unable to win
outside of Pittsburgh. Added to that was
the fact that none of Pitt’s ﬁrst 18 oppo-
nents wereranked in the top 25.

But by taking the Huskies -- a team
many believe will win a national title this
year — to the ﬁnal shot off the game, the
Panthers earned much more than they had
in any of their 18 wins.‘ . .

‘‘It’s-tough to accept the [critics] say-
ing we don’t deserve to be ranked,” said
Pitt point guard Carl Krauser. “We just
made a couple of mistakes and if we don’t
make them, we win the game. I don’t have
any regrets.”

By leading all scorers with 24 points

Pitt may have earned respect in loss

and bringing Pitt so close to knocking oﬂ .
one of the top teams in the country on its
home court, Krauser felt like he earned
some respect of his own

“Maybe ‘people don’t give me credit
because they think I’m a ﬂashy player
from New York,” he said. “But as soon as
the lights go on, I’m like a Broadway
show. I'm never going to run away from a
ﬁght”

But the person who gained the most
respect was Dixon.

When Ben Howland left for UCLA
after last season, Pitt looked outside of the
program, tryingtolandacoachwithas
recognizable a name as the man who left.
But there were no takers. '

So the Panthers, with some encourage-
ment from their players, chose Dixon —- a
coach who had spent his entire coaching
career in the college ranks as an assistant.
And so far, it looks as ifPitt made the right
choice. _ '

Against UConn, Dixon was facing a

ticket fiasco a
distant memory

J OE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

, In the grand scheme of things,
the morning of Oct. 8 will probably
go down as any old day in Pitt histo-
ry.

Classes went on as they do every
day. Buses and cars circled the cam-
pus like they always do. Students
worked hard, or hardly worked, like
normal. V

But for the athletics department,
it was a nightmare. The plan to sell
men’s basketball tickets online
crashed, along with the server, and
many Pitt students were complain-
ing about the way the department
decided to straighten out the mess.
Call it The Basketball Season Ticket
Debacle, Part II.

A lot has happened since then
that has made people forget the
problems that came with purchasing
student tickets for men’s basketball
games. But the process that was
originally planned is still beingused
and, according to Jim Earle, it has
worked.

“The sense here is that it’s’ gone
well, except for the original sale,”
said Earle, who is the Associate
Athletics ‘Director for New Business
and Fan Development. “As far as the
actual distribution, it’s gone well.
Our intent behind this was to make

it possible for as many students as-

possible to get tickets.” .
The plan to give tickets out —~-on
previously scheduled pickup dates
has worked, up to this point.
Students with season tickets -have

come on those scheduled days to get i

their tickets and the tickets that
aren’t picked up after two days are
held for other students to purchase.

With just five home games
remaining, there are only three pick-
up dates left — today for games
against Boston College and St.
John’s; Feb. 2 for Pitt’s matchup
with Connecticut and Feb. 16. to see
games against Syracuse and
Villanova.

While Pitt has been able to con-
tinue its success in the Petersen

Glaring weaknesses exposed in loss to UConn,

. Well Pitt  x

  

fans, you
knew that ‘
Pitt’s unde-

feated streak
had to come
to an end
some time.

The No.
8 Panthers’ —
winning streak, which reached 18
games, ended with a 68-65 loss at
Connecticut last night. In less than a
month, UConn and Pitt will face-off
again at the Petersen Events Center.

The Feb". 15 matchup date gives the
Panthers plenty of opportunity to make
some adjustments, because there were
some weaknesses exposed in the loss. A
glaring weakness is Pitt’s lack of pro-
ductive big men.‘

Maybe Pitt has been spoiled this sea-
son with having freshman Chris Taft as
its center. Taft is 6—feet-10-inches where-
as, last year, starting center Ontario Lett
was only 6—feet-.6-inches.

Forward Chevon Troutman is a
viable option at 6—feet-7-inches, but ide-
ally Taft and Troutman should be on the
ﬂoor at the same time. This presents the
problem of replacing Taft— with some-
body off the bench. Or vice versa.

Forward Mark McCarroll has seen a

' lot of minutes and is actually the tallest
 player on the team that sees regular play-

ing time at 6-feet-1l—inches. The prob-
lem is that he is not a wide body.
McCarroll tips the scales at 220 pounds.

_ To give you an idea of his lack of size,

center Toree Morris is an inch shorter,
but weighs 282 pounds.

I Huskie center Emeka Okafor is '6-
feet-10—inches, and turned in a dominant
performance in the ﬁrst half with nine

points. He was able to hit several shots,

which Troutman, who guarded him for a
good portion of the game, was unable to
stop. He was held to two second—half
points, but was able to grab seven boards
in the game. a
When Troutman and Taft left the

ﬂoor there was an obvious void as
UConn went ,up 20-10 in the first half.
Pitt has been ﬂirting with danger too
often lately. It cannot afford to spot a
team like UConn a 10-point lead.

There were still issues when Pitt’s big
men were on the ﬂoor as Pitt actually
out-rebounded UConn 37-30, but down
a crucial stretch of the game, the
Huskies were able to come up with key
rebounds. .

' At times it appeared as if nobody
was crashing the boards for the Panthers,
especially on the defensive end. UConn
was able to grab more offensive
rebounds than the Panthers as it recorded

19 compared to Pitt’s 17.

There was even a point when Pitt’s
defense forced a missed shot only to
have Okafor slam the ball through the
hole. ' .

Another problem was the number of
points Pitt gave up in the paint. The
Panthers recorded 24 points in the paint,
but yielded 34. There were too many
uncontested layups or slam dunks by the
Huskies. Pitt must step up its inside
game on defense in order to beat UConn
when it comes to the Pete.

The Panthers also were lackadaisical
at times. On a few occasions, a Huskie
was able to get behind Pitt’s ‘defense and

convert a long pass for an easy basket.
Pitt gave up 10 fast break points in the
contest.

On offense, the Panthers turned the
ball over nine times in the first half, but
settled down in the second half. The first
half featured bad passes and overall
sloppy play. Pitt took care of the ball
much better in the second half, only
committing three turnovers.

There are a lot of positives in this
loss. Seniors stepped up and showed vet-
eran leadership especially when Pitt was
able to regain the lead. will) the Huskies

did all the little things to hold the Pitt
men’s basketball team together, but hard-
ly got any recognition. .

Now, Brown has stepped up his
offensive game and everyone seems to
know who the guy wearing number four
1S.

And once again, Brown led the
Panthers in scoring with 19  to help
Pitt come from behind to defeat Rutgers,
59-49, on Saturday and extend its winning
streak to 18 games heading into Pitt’s Jan.
19 showdown with Connecticut

Brown made eight of 15 shots from
the ﬁeld and hadﬁve steals, while Chris
Taft added 17 points . and grabbed 12
rebounds for his third double-double of
the season. Pitt (18-0 overall, 4-0 in the
Big East) defeated the Scarlet Knights (9-
5, 1-3) for the sixth straight time. ,

Ricky Shields led the Knights with 10

points, while Pitt held Herve Lamizana, '

Rutgers’ leading scorer with 14.5 points
per game, to just six points on three-of-12
shooting.

“I thought [Lamizana] would uy to
post me more, so I tiied to keep him off
the block,” said Brown, who spent most
of the game guarding Lamizana despite
giving close to six inches to the Rutgers
forward. “He was getting pretty frustrat-
ed.” A

Brown was fnistrating Rutgers on the

other end of the ﬂoor as well, picking up
big baskets whenever the Panthers needed
them, including Pitt’s only ﬂiree-point
baskets of the game in the second half.

“We did well in the second half
pulling ourselves together,” said Carl
Krauser, who had eight assistsgto go along
with six points. “We know what we have
to do [to win] because we’ve been around
the block.”

However, it looked as if the Knights
might be the ones to end not only Pitt’s

winning streak, but the Panthers’ unbeat-

en—at-home streak as well.

The Knights trailed by six after 20
minutes, but cut the lead in half with
15:28 to go. Pitt went back up by six
before Rutgers went on a 13-1 run and the

.Knights held their largest led at 43-37

with just under 12 minutes remaining.
But Pitt scored 11 of the next 15
points, including a three by Brown and a
dunk by Taft, to go up by one point with
six minutes remaining in ‘ the game.

Rutgers would not go away, however,

answering Pitt’s baskets until the score
was tied at 49 with 4:20 remaining in the
game. . 0
After Quincy Douby’s game tying
basket, the Knights would go cold from
the ﬂoor, watching Pitt ﬁnish the game on
a 10-0 run behind Brown and Taft -
‘The shot was there and I let it come
to me,” Brown said about his three from
the corner with two minutes left “Julius
[Page] was telling me to shoot, so I shot
it.” . .

Guard Jaron Brown prepares to jam the ball during Pitt’s 59-49 victory over
Rutgers on Saturday. Brown led Pitt with 19 points.

From the 12-minute point on, the
Panthers outscored Rutgers, 22-6.

“I thought we outplayed them for 30
minutes,” said Rutgers coach Gary
Waters. “They’re physical inside and
that’s where they win the battle and the
war. They played tougher and tougher and
physically took it to our heart.”

After having trouble on the boards
against Miami and Notre Dame, Pitt out-
rebounded Rutgers, 36-30, and blocked
seven Scarlet Knights’ shots, led by Taft’s
ﬁve. . -

“He’s a great inside force,” Page said
about Taft. “He could get a double-double

every night.”

Pitt started the game by jumping out
to a 14-9 lead and,,with 8:15 left in the
ﬁrst half, the Panthers held a six-point
lead, their biggest lead of the half. But
Rutgers fought back with a 8-1 run to take
a one-point lead.

The Knights’ lead would be short
lived, however, as Brown and Taft scored
nine of the half’s ﬁnal 11 points to take a
30-24 lead in at halftime.

After two seasonsas a Panther, Fitzgerald applies for 2004 NFL Draft

It was only a matter of time before the Eagles
blew another championship game and Larry
Fitzgerald packed his bags for the 

The spanking the Eagles took on Sunday was
rather fascinating. However, the fact that there will be
no more Larry in a Panthers uniform is rather gloomy.

I have to admit, despite the rumors and talk about
what he was going to do with the upcoming season,
there was still a little shock when the words hit me
Sunday afternoon that Fitzgerald did, in fact, turn in
an application for the NFL and he would be most like-
ly declared eligible by week’s end to leave school
early. ' .

There is certainly nothing wrong with his deci-
sion, but to see him go is so overwhelming to the aver-

age Pitt fan. I knew, just like everybody else, that '

there was no chance that a man of his status could
stick around for another dreadful season, but in the
back of my mind there was still a fragment of hope
that he would stick around for one more year.
Just like everything else he’s done on and off the
ﬁeld, Fitzgerald handled the situation with class.
Saturday afternoon, he was honored at halftime of

I the Pitt men’s basketball game for winning the Walter

Camp Award. He worked the crowd with his charm,
smiling and waving, shaking hands with everyone in

1 his‘ sight as the student body chanted “one more year.” .

9.

"He accepted

 ‘the award,
. holding it in
the air with
pride, know-

 
 

of his mind
that this would
be his last
honor as a
Panther. .

At that point, most of us knew he was gone, but
how could you bad mouth the guy for living the dream
that nearly every man in the arena had at some point
in their life? He’s going to be an NFL superstar.

He never promised he would return. He simply
answered with “no comment” when asked about his
future. I’d rather hear “no comment” then an un-kept
promise like we heard so many times from Ben
Howland.

Fitzgerald’s a 20-year-old kid going on 45. He
single-handedly turned Pitt football into one of the
premier programs in the country.

He brought so much joy and made so many mem-
ories in his two seasons at Pitt that it’s impossible to
turn your back on him for his early departure.

The accomplishments Fitzgerald made in a

ing inthe back I

............._..,...-.... . . . L . . ..

Panther uniform are far greater than any of us could
imagine. He set too many records to count. He was
simply brilliant. ' .

Fitzgerald was perhaps the biggest marketing tool
Pitt has ever seen. -

If somebody were to tell me that Pitt would have
a standing room-only crowd on hand at Heinz Field
two years ago, I would have chuckled. But to see
65,000 plus at an average home game this season with
all eyes glued to N 0.1 was remarkable. '

A guy like Fitzgerald doesn’t come around very
often, so you have to appreciate what he. did in the
short period that he was here.

The man is irreplaceable. We may never see any-
thing like him again. But how can you not root him on
and wish him the best?

He’s going to be a top ﬁve pick in the 2004 draft,
no question. He’s going to be a star on a terrible NFL
team and help turn their program around, just like he
did with a mediocre Pitt team. The kid is a walking
success story who’s future is so bright. 1

You better believe that when the Steelers aren’t
playing and I have the chance next year, I’ll be watch-
ing and cheering for No. 1 on Sundays.

‘Pitt got into trouble in the first half when Page

shot, he slowed the pace down and was
able to give guard Julius Page a better

- Pitt’s performance on the road was a big
question mark going into last night’s
game. Its ability to bounce back at
Syracuse, which is another tough envi-
ronment, will be a great barometer for
the rest of the season.

UConn snaps

Streak page 17

fairly high—proﬁle coach in Jim Calhoun.
In his 18th season holding the reigns for
the Huskies, Calhoun is someone that
Dixon admitted he and Howland looked
up to when they ﬁrst arrived at Pitt.

‘To come in here and have people
think that it’s a rivalry,” Pitt’s coach said
with a chuckle, “five years ago, this was
not much of a rivalry. I’m not going to call
it that, but I guess if you keep getting close
games like this, you have to call it some-
thing.” -

Despite  lost to Pitt twice last
season, Calhoun though this year’s squad
was better. '

“We haven’t faced anyone as tough as
them,” he said after the game. “To Jamie"s
credit, we couldn’t speed up the game. We
kept trying and trying and trying, but ﬂiey
kept slowing us down.”

For ﬂie ﬁrst time this year, the

0‘ Panthers will return to the court knowing
that they did not win their previous game.
But in Krauser’s mind, that should not be a
problem.

“We’re just going to take it day—by—
day, practice—by-practice,” he said. “We’re
going to work on what we need to work
on and execute on Saturday.”

could not -have been done without

the students.

“We’ve all seen the impact stu-
dents have,” he said_. “I don’t know
if we win against Notre Dame [on
Jan. 12] if they aren’t there.”

Unlike last year, the department
feels the studentshave done a decent
job of supporting the team recently. '

“It seems that students are com-
ing out in masses for conference
games,” Earle added. “Early on, we
were concerned because during the
early season non-conference games,
attendance was pretty poor.” I

But with the way the early-sea-
son schedule exists at the end of the
fall semester makes it harder for stu-
dents to attend games. With
Thanksgiving break coming close to
the beginning of the season, fol-
lowed shortly afterwards by finals
and winter break, students are either
too busy to attend_ games or just
aren’t in Pittsburgh. V "

“With it being the end of the
semester with finals makes it more
challenging" for students,” Earle
said. “If we had some Big East con-
ference games at the end of the
semester, then they’ll be there. It’s
the timing and the competition.”

FRIDAY JANUARY 23RD!!

  

Watching a team like Pitt com-»

pete on its home floor with the likes
of Chicago State or Arkansas Pine-
Bluff is not exciting to some people
that purchase tickets. But with a
team that has been consistently high
in the rankings for over two years,
it’s hard for Earle to understand why
students wouldn’t want to attend
games just to see their own school
perform. ‘

“It’s a rare opportunity, with as
successful as [the team] has been,”

he said. “I sense that the perception-

is that it’s not going to be as com-
petitive and that’s a dangerous
assumption. It’s a fact that any team
can lose on any given night.”

' Pitt almost found that out the
hard. way against Georgetown
College, a NAIA. school from
Kentucky. Just 6,234 people saw the
Tigers .give Pitt its toughest game up
to that point of the season, falling to
the Panthers, 79-74.

“We knew they were going to be
a good, -talented team. They have
some transfers from Division ‘I_,”
Earle said. “You never know. You
almost saw it there. It’s a prime
example of never knowing when
you’re going to need that sixth
man.” ,

Despite the fact that only an

average of 300 students attended
games early in the season, Earle
feels that students’ biggest com-
plaint will be that there are not
enough season tickets offered to
them.

“By them not showing up makes
[that] difficult to justify,” he said.
“There is a core group of students
that is always there, but we need to
find ways to get kids to come out to
earlier games. It’s really a different
atmosphere.” .

While he says that the depart-
ment has not looked into revising the
system for next year yet, Earle said
that they are looking for ways to get
plenty of feedback from students.

“We’re still trying to collect
feedback for next year,” Earle said.
“We want to, meet with Student
Government and‘. [SGB president]
Brian Kelly to get feedback for stu-
dent reaction.”

Overall, Earle is pleased with the
way things have turned out up to this
point.

“We have a waiting list of over
1,000 people,” he said. ‘_‘Pitt basket-
ball is the hottest ticket in town and
that is a tribute to our team. What
it’s been able to do has created a
frenzy. It’s great to see the city ral-
lying around them.”
