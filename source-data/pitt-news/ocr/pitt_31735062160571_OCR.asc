THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Pledges Aid

  In Salvation  

Army Nite

Tonight has been officially
declared Salvation A.rmy
Night. At a recent meeting
held by the Interfraternity
Council, it was decided that
the pledges would cover most
of the downtown area.

The pledges from all fraterni-
ties on the University of Pitts-
burgh’s campus will be given the
opportunity to work as one unit
during this’ soliciting program.

Ray King, assistant to the Dean

R of Meniand advisor to fraternities

said, “This community‘ project

5 will not only give the pledges a
~ chance to show the City of Pitts-

burgh the value of fraternity life,
but by participating in this pro-
gram, they will be making a needy
and worthwhile contribution to
society.”

Pitt must meet the challenge
of Carnegie Tech’s fraternities
who participated in this pro-
gram for one evening last year
and raised‘ $300. . _

Atthe present time there are
approximately 230 pledges in the
‘fr“aternity system. Sponsors of the
program have urged that at least
175 of the ‘pledges participate to
insure success of the plan.

All pledges and some actives
who are to participate will as-
semble at Salvation Army Head‘-
qiiarters, 425 Boulevard of the
Allies at 6:30 tonight. Every-
thing from that point on will be
handled by Captain Marshall of
the Salvation Army. \

The collection will end by 9
pm. Pledges will cover most
street corners in the shopping area
downtown.

Chapel To Present Carol Silig
In Answer To Student Demand

In response to numerous reduests, students will join;

in a Christmas Carol Sing tomorrow at noon in the Heinz

Chapel.

Ten familiar carols will be sung by all those present.

Among these selections will be “O Come All Ye Faithful,”
“The First Noel,” “It Came Uponthe -Midnight Clear,” “O

Little Town of Bethlehem,” “JoyO

to the World,” “God Rest Ye
Merry, Gentlemen,” “Silent
Night,” “Hark the I-lerald\Angels
Sing” and “The Holly and the
Ivy’):

The Heinz Chapel Choir will
present French, German and Ital-
{an carols, under the direction of
Phillip Kniseley.

Dr. Emory Luccock stressed
the fact that the Sing has come
about because of popular re-
quest. It.is an opportunity pro-
ided for students who have tn-
vided for students who have en-
the Commons Room in previous
years.

The idea of a Christmas Carol
Sing was ﬁrst suggested by two
members of the football team,
Right Halfback Jim Theodore and
Center Charlie Brueckman.

“G rant   Provides Radiation 3 Study

Chancellor Litchfield today
‘announced the establishment
of a major ten—year training
program, designed to equip
public health expert to guard

iation hazards. ,

This new program has been
made possible by a $500,000 grant
from the Rockefeller Foundation,

ilar awards to Harvard and Johns
Hopkins. t I
This project will be directed by

Graduate School of Public Health.

Program Evolved From Study.
The grants are an outgrowth of

independent study conducted by S.

the National Academy of Sciences
on biological effects of atomic ra-
diation in genetics,‘ pathology, and
the disposal of atomic wastes.
“Immediate responsibility for
the Pitt program,” according to
Dr. Parran, “will rest with the

This enabled the School to de-
velop courses of instruction in

The Pitt program will be
strongly oriented toward‘ the

Won By Dukes;

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

' The Duquesne Dukes won
their third Steel Bowl basket-
ball Tournament title by
crushing the Panthers, 81-64,
on Saturday night at the Me-
morial Field "House.

‘ The tourney was a wierd affair,
marked by excessive roughness
and frequently excellent basket-
ball. The winning margin of sev- '
enteen points was not indicative
of the closenessgof three—quarters

of the game, but did demonstrate .
the superiority of Coach Dudey

Moore’s well—executed strategy.
-. The Bluﬂites double-teamed
Panther ace Don Hennon most of
the night and played a free-lance
man~to-man defense on the rest
of the Blue and Gold ﬁoormen.
Consequently, with Hennon bot-
tled up, the remaining Panthers
seemed.unwilling to go for th
bucket. I t
’ Pegues Fouls Out

Even with this handicap, the
locals were right in the game up
to the ten-minute mark of the
second half. In fact, they led at
half-time .by a 31-29 score. But
with 10:11 remaining to be played,
Co-capain Jules Pegues committed
his ﬁfth personal foul.
and the major rebounding threats,
outside of little Hennon, eliminat-
ed, Duquesne scored at will and
regained the Steel Bowl trophy
from the Panthers, 81-64.

The threat of the outside shot
was thus removed and the
Dukes immediately took control.
In four minutes the lead was 59-
49 and the Mooremen went into
a skillful freeze. Locals Chuck
Hursh, Dave Sawyer, and John
Mills were helpless to break the
freeze as they each had‘ four
personals. The situation became
desperate as the Blulﬁtes con-
trolled the ball effortlessly for
overa minute and twenty sec-
onds.

Finally, I-Iursh went for the ball
and committed his fatal foul. With

Kenny George, Charlie Biggs,

scenes men of the Phnther football team,

Frank Carver, Howard Waite,

and Gold displayed a better brand of football than their rec-

ord denotes.

“Skyscraper U. was deﬁnitely weakened by injuries to

key players and numerous indi— 6

‘vidual cases of the Asian ﬂu, but

, the team gave it all they had in
each game,” was the consensus
of opinions from the above
mentioned Panther personnel.

Howard Waite and Roger Mc-
Gill, the head trainer and assistant
trainer respectively, were’ kept
quite busy treating members of
the “Injury Club.” The charter
members included Dick Bowen,
Charles Brueckman, Jim McCus-
ker, and Joe Scisly.

The graduate manager of ath-

takes care of the team’s transpor-

news releases regarding the

stepped in to part“ the ﬁghters.
All he got for his efforts was a
right hook to the head.

After order was restored and

Jacobs was revived, the pressure
appeared reli<ived.and no further
rough—housing took place. The
coaches and oﬁicials agreed that a
double foul -should be called, but
that the combatants should not be
ejected from the game. The Dukes
were cautious about contactin the
second half, but employed a de-
liberate offense which caused the
Panthers to commit the additional
fouls which ultimately cost them
the game. I ’
