Catovic deﬁnes ‘natural consequences of war’

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

Students were warned Friday to stop
being the “me” generation and to start
being the “we" generation.

“The term ‘ethnic cleansing’ should
turn the stomachs and put shivers
down the spine of anyone who calls
himself a human being,” said Saffet Abid
Catovic, assistant to U.N. ambassador to
Bosnia and Herzegovina during a lec-
ture.

“My reason for having Catovic speak
was to let people see the Bosnian per-
spective,” said Islam Albarazi, president
of Pitt International Student
Organization. “People need to be aware
of a perspective other than the Western
World’s point of view.”

Catovic, accompanied by a bodyguard,
shared his experience and knowledge of
the war in the former Yugoslavia and

said that ethnic cleansing denies people
the right to be who they are.

According to Catovic, stopping the
Serbian ethnic cleansing of the Croatians
and the Bosnians is not a question of
stopping a civil war but instead a ques-
tion of serving humanity and democracy.

Catovic spoke of a nation that at one
time could embody three constituent
peoples: Muslims, Croatians and
Serbians.

“For 600 years three unique religious
and cultural heritages lived at peace in
the city of Sarajevo,” Catovic said. “The
1984 Winter Olympics showed the world
a city where three diverse peoples could
live in harmony.”

Now there is a mission not to destroy,
Catovic said, but to eliminate an entire
nationality by means of a systematic
genocide.

“The concentration camps of World
War II, the concentration camps this

nation has said it would never allow
again, are happening.” Catovic said.
“The crime is against humanity."

These crimes against humanity.
Catovic said. are classified “natural con-
sequences of war."

Catovic addressed the women in the
audience by asking if one of every two
women being raped and 47 established
rape camps should be declared "natural
consequences of war.”

“Women, you need to have these
rapes declared crimes against humanity,"
Catovic demanded, saying he believes
the world stands indicted for the slaugh-
ter of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

“This sick and demonic mentality, this
side of humanity, should not be seen by
any human being,” Catovic said.

“It is time to stand up and speak out.
Don’t leave here being an educated bar-
barian, speak out and say enough is
enough.”

Many Pitt students are able to
eat a balanced meal several
times a day in a cafeteria or in a
local eating establishment, but
others in the area are not always
so lucky. _

This year, the Pitt community
can once again provide assis-
tance to some Western
Pennsylvania residents in need
with the help of the Scouting for
Food campaign.

The campaign, in its sixth
year at Pitt, is co-sponsored by
the university and the Allegheny
Trails Council of the Boy Scouts
of America.

“The Western Pennsylvania
campaign is the largest in the
country,” Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs William Harmon
said. “This shows both’ the great
need locally and the compas-
sion of Western Pennsylvanian
people for their neighbors.”

Food will be collected at vari-
ous sites on campus, including

Pitt students takeafield trip to a Seder

By Michael Srulevich
For The Pitt News

During the holiday of Passover, Jews
retell the story of the exodus from slav-
ery in the land of Egypt to freedom.
Last Thursday, Jewish as well as non-
Je.wish and African-American Pitt stu-
dents, sat down at a service known as
the Seder to retell the story together.

The black—Jewish Seder, held at
Rodef Shalom, a local synagogue in
Oakland, was an activity of the class
entitled Blacks and Jewish History.
Rabbi Debbie Pine, an associate rabbi
of the synagogue, hosted the Seder and
explained the various symbols, foods
and themes of Passover such as suffer-
ing. oppression and freedom.

"I thought it was great,” said Dan
Garner. a Pitt dental student. “It was
very informative. I definitely see some
of the similarities between the Jews’
struggle for freedom and our struggle
as African Americans for full rights
today.”

Jewish students echoed Garner’s sen-
timents.

“It was a really good experience 
and a good opportunity for cultural

exchange,” Monique Correll said.

This is the sixth black—Jewish Seder,
noted Dr. Barbara Burstin, who usually
co-teaches the Pitt class with Dr. Larry
Glascoe (currently on Semester at Sea).
She said she believes the Seder is a
very valuable educational experience
and wants them to continue.

“The Seder was really instructive —
even for me as a Jew,” Pitt senior
Leslee Schwartz said. “The rabbi did a
great job of explaining what was going
on and I learned more about the Seder
that I didn’t really know before."

"I really enjoyed the Seder, and I’m
not Jewish or black. The theme of suf-
fering is one that we can all relate to as
human beings — no matter where we
come from," Jenn Kalinowski said.

In addition to the black-Jewish Seder,
the class has experienced various ot
her activities outside the classroom.
Two weeks ago, the class attended
services at a black church in the
Hill District led by NAACP head
Reverend Thomas Smith, who also
attended the Seder. Speakers
such as Leon Haley head of the
Urban League of Pittsburgh and Rabbi
James Gibson from Temple Sinai have

also addressed the class on various
topics including the black-Jewish dia-
logue. '

Most students hold a Very favorable
attitude on the history class, Adam
Levitt said.

“The discussion aspect of the class
makes it really interesting and different
than a lot of other classes I’ve taken,”
said Cindy Shushansky, a sophomore
studying social work. “The class has
taught me a lot about black culture,
and at the same time a lot about my
own Jewish culture.”

“It’s a very different class,” Heather
Taylor said.

"Not only does it deal with two
groups which have largely been
ignored, but the whole setting of the
class makes it so that there is no way a
person can walk out of there without
learning anything  Frankly, I think
everyone should be subject to and
learn about a culture that’s different
from their own.”

The Seder was also attended by two
other Pitt classes: Jews in the United
States and History of the Holocaust.
The Seder was sponsored by the
Maurice Falk Medical Fund.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, April 12, 1993

ASO president shares thoughts on South Africa

By Thanita Adams
Staff Writer

On a day when most Pitt
students are dressed in
shorts and enjoying the
warm weather, Sean Lewis‘
lanky frame is layered in
clothing as he waits out the
last miserable stages of what
he thinks is the flu.

He said he never gets sick,
but, then again, Pittsburgh’s
temperamental weather is a
far cry from that of Lewis’
native South Africa.

Even during his bout with
the flu, Lewis said he was
thinking about more than

 

Africas mild climate — he
was thinking about the polit-
ical and social unrest that is
proliferating the continent at
the moment.

South Africa, like the rest
of the continent, has been in
a “continuous stage of
revolt” for some years now,
Lewis explained. The white
South African government,
the Nationalist Party, has
held power in the country
for the past 300 years by
controlling the economy, the
military and the police force.

“But the Nationalist Party
is now admitting that it can-
not govern the country any

longer." Lewis said. pointing
to the recent upheavals
against apartheid.

The country is now look-
ing at a huge change in its
governmental process. The
Nationalist Party has been
negotiating with other
groups such as the Inkatha
Freedom Party and the
African National Congress
for a democratic election.
This election, which would
be the first democratic elec-
tion in South Africa, is tenta-
tively slated for September
1995 or May 1994.

"Hundreds of thousands of

people have died to give us.

the right to vote." Lewis
said. “The country is headed
towards destruction at the
moment. Unless the South
African government wants to
destroy the country, it will
hold the election.“

Lewis first came to the
United States in 1987 and
received his master’s degree
in computer andeducation
at the State University of
New York at Albany. He had
earned his bachelor’s degree
at the University at Cape
Town, where he also taught
high school.

He is currently working as
a computer consultant for

l’itt’s linguistics department
and is the president of the
newly formed African
Students‘ Organization.

Although Lewis likes
Pittsburgh, which he finds
“quaint,“ he is planning on
returning home to Cape
Town once he finishes his
studies here. He said he
misses Africa with its warm
weather, beaches and moun-
tains.

Lewis wants to bring his
education and knowledge
back to Africa. where he
feels that Africans should

American ancestry to explore the languages. and through languages the cultures. of their heritage. We will offer
Directed Study courses to individual students (or small groups). helping students to learn about their ancestor‘s
languages. The only restriction is that we must be able to find materials for students to read and work with: but
since most languages of North America and MesoAmerica. and many languages of South America. are either fairly
well documented or members of well-documented language families. we do not anticipate having to turn anyone

Students will work with one of three Linguistics faculty members: Daniel Everett. Terrence Kaufman. or Sarah
Thomason. (We may have to restrict the number of students who enroll in any given term. because we will teach
these special courses in addition to our normal course load.) Each course will begin with a general survey of Native
American language families and their distribution. followed by intensive work with one language or language
group. The course is available for two or three credits. Students who prefer a course that focuses on a detailed
general survey of the languages of the Americas should enroll instead in our regular course in American Indian
Languages. taught by Professor Kaufman (next offering: Fall 1993).

their own problems.
“There is a lot of war in
the continent now,” Lewis
said. Centuries ago “Africa

was divided up by
Europeans who
ignored the cultural

boundaries. This created
conditions for conflict.
Peoples’ ways of life
were disrupted. Since
then, people have been
struggling to find a
way of life that makes
sense.”

Lewis said that the wars
that are now going on in
Africa (such as the ones in
Rwanda, Somalia, Zaire
and Angola) are taking
place as different tradi-
tional societies attempt to
work things out for them-
selves. He said that it is
better now that no major
European powers are con-
trolling Africa, but he is
upset about the conflicts
taking place.

“I think it’s horrible that
people are having to kill
each other,” Lewis said.

Although Lewis attribut-
es many of‘Africa’s cur-
rent problems to past
European influences,
he accedes thatthese
problems have been com-
pounded by the greed and
corruption of some offi-
cials in the African gov-
ernment.

Lewis is also frustrated
with Africa’s lack of an
industrial infrastructure.

“The West has tried to
maintain us as economi-
cally inferior by exporting
raw materials and selling
back finished goods,” he
said. “A lot of wealth is
being taken out of the
country.”

Lewis definitely has
opinions about what
is taking place in Africa
and why. He would
like to see some change
but knows .a long. and
difficult road marks
Africa’s future. But,
for the time being, Lewis
will watch, wait, doctor
his flu and hope for the
best.

Why is it that the more people we graduate from
college, the less competitive we become as a nation?
Why is it that the better we are “educated” the lower
our math and science scores are relative to other
nations? Finally, why have hunger, crime and drugs
become increasingly prevalent throughout society
when a properly educated populace is supposed to
be able to dispose of these chronic social ills?

The questions abound. The answers are few. As
this year’s class approaches graduation, many are
wondering if they are adequately prepared to face
the world ahead. George Bush, the so-called “educa-
tion” president, did little to stop this downward
slope into a morass of ignorance. Fairfax County,
Virginia tied teachers’ pay to merit but had to cut
the program because of declining revenue and sub-
standard results. Other popular suggestions to halt
this societal decline have included school choice
and now President Clinton’s National Job Corps
Training Program.

The highly touted and publicized training program
trades college financing for national service.
Individuals who cannot afford the costs of tuition
will be allowed to attend college in return for ser-
vice as a police officer, teacher, social worker, etc.
Likewise, part of the funding for this bill goes
toward increased vocational training for those who

' do not wish to attend college.

The vocational aspect of it is a necessary and legit-
imate proposal. The manufacturing base of this
country has declined considerably, and the United
States now has the highest ratio of managers to
workers of any major industrialized country.
Translation: It now means that we are hiring too
many middle managers in jobs that traditional
“workers” are more than capable of handling them-
selves. V

Some would say that having a college for every-
body isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But our system of
higher education has become diluted and with it the
“American dream.” Value is a function of scarcity.
The college diploma today is anything but scarce;
yet we continue to celebrate those who have gradu-
ated from college (as if it meanssomething) and
look down upon those who haven’t.

Programs like the Job Corps Training‘ Program fur-
ther distort the hopes of a college graduate. Not
graduating from college need not be a bad thing.
The college diploma has become an overvalued
commodity, and sooner or later there will be a
crash. Getting back to the manufacturing base and
training workers is where Clinton should put this
money.

As it stands now, the United States has too many
individuals who know about postmodern impres-
sionists and not enough who can tighten a screw.

propped up outside my win-
dow. In amazement I woke
my roommate up to show
him what was happening.
Needless to say, coming
from the city he was not too
impressed.

Food was another shocker
for me. In reading over the
pamphlet for Pitt I noticed
that it said the food was edi-
ble but not great. An under-
statement if there ever was
one. ‘ —
Breakfast was safe — I
recognized Captain Crunch
and Lucky Charms well
enough. Lunch was about
the same —— the hamburgers
were cold and greasy, but
edible.

Dinner was another story.
The name tag that night said

steak. But it didn’t look like ‘

any steak I’d ever seen.
Thank God there was pizza.
Having found a “safe food” I
ate pizza for the first month
here, and I lost that 400
pounds I’d been meaning to
shed.

And then. And then there
were the women. After hav-
ing settled in my room, the
few people I knew found out
that hundreds of people
were in the Towers lobby.
Three of us entered the tem-
sea of young
women with our heads spin-

ning. Seeing someone alone
I approached her and asked
in a suave tone, “Excuse me
do you know what time it
is?” She gave me the time
and thinking quickly I fol-
lowed up with, “Say, when is
the curfew anyway?”

She looked at me and
laughed. This was no fresh-
man, I thought to myself.
Nevertheless, things went
over pretty well, and this

Cameron
  Harvey

“older woman” and I decid-
ed to go for a walk.

I had heard, that the
Beehive was a pretty hip
place to hang out. When we
got there the two of us felt
like we were in a bad vam-
pire movie, with a plethora
of mysteriously dressed
“individuals” walking about.
When it was our turn to
order, I tried to be as
debonair as possible. I
ordered a double espresso
for myself and a lemonade
for her.

Never having had an
espresso before, much less a
double, it took nothing short
of a Herculean effort not to
gag on it. Trying to maintain
my poise, I gasped to her,
“How’s the lemonade?”

“Fine, just fine. Are you
OK? Your eyes are water-
ing.”

“Me, oh yeah, I’m great,
just great.”

After trying to dump some
of the espresso on the floor,
my date asked if I wanted to
come up and see her room.

Happy, yet dumbfounded,
I said yes. So this is what
college women are like, I
thought to myself. When we
got there I felt relieved.

It turns out she was a
freshman just like me. Her
furniture as uncomfortable

and ugly as mine. And she
was just as confused. The
two of us sat there for hours
talking about everything and
anything. Despite the espres-
so, around 4:0O in the morn-
ing the two of us got really
sleepy.

I asked her if she wanted
me to leave.

“Only if you want to,” she
replied. And so it went for
two more hours — the talk-
ing and the laughing.

I woke up the next morn-
ing in a panic. Where was I?
What happened last night?
But the door to the room
opened and she walked in.
“Good morning!”

“Morning, it’s 3:00 in the
afternoon!”

Unfazed she said, “Do you
want to get some lunch?"

“Yeah,_but the cafeterials
kind of gross. Especially the
steak. I heard that the O’s
really neat —— just like the
Hard Rock Cafe.”

Well, I was right. It
was just like the Hard Rock
Cafe. It had four walls and
served food.

When we got there,
policemen were standing
inside and there were peo-
ple everywhere. I told
her to order for us while I
used the bathroom.

Before that day, I’d never
actually seen a cockroach,
much less four or five.

‘Visions of Edgar Allen Poe

flashed through my head.
What if the walls start drip-
ping blood?

After all, they were drip-
ping with everything else.
Needless to say, after
coming back up, my appetite
was gone.

Welcome to Pitt. Maybe
things haven’t changed as
much as I thought.

Pitt baseball team
streaks into first

By Tom Schneider
Staﬂ’ Writer

The Pitt baseball team entered
the University of Connecticut’s
Christian Field this past weekend
as a team not only on a roll, but
also on a mission.

After taking two of three games
from last year’s Big East regular
season champ, St. John’s, the
Panthers were looking at their trip
to UConn as a chance to move
into uncharted territory -- first
place in the conference.

The Panthers answered the call
by outscorin_g the Huskies 17-4
during a doubleheader on Friday,
despite splitting the two games.

A last-minute rally by the
Huskies in game one ruined an
otherwise fantastic pitching per-
formance by Panther Bill Junker,
as UConn scored two runs with
two outs in the bottom of the sev-
enth to win the game 2-1. Pitt took
control in the second game, how-
ever, and dispelled any doubts the
UConn faithful may have had
about their offensive capabilities
by crushing the Huskies 16-2.

Panther, second baseman Brad .
Reese continued his tonid hitting
pace, going 6 for 8 overthe two
games, while driving -in four runs
and scoring three himself. Other
weekend standouts were left field-
er Craig Crawley (4 for 6, 4 RBI),
center fielder Al Lardo (4 for 7, 1
RBI) and catcher Joey Berteotti (2
for 5, 5 RBI), among others.

In the first game of the after-
noon, Pitts Junker held a precari-
ous 1-0 lead into the bottom of the
seventh inning, when the Huskies
finally managed to piece together
enough hits and Panther goofs to
produce a win.

With two outs and a man at
third base, Junker threw a wild
pitch, allowing UConn’s Sean Irey
to race home from third to tie the
game at one run apiece. Junker
was chased after UConn"s Jim
T onelli singled, and Panther first-
year sensation Matt Skokowski
was brought in to stop the bleed-
ing.

Much to the Panthers’ chagrin,
the usually dependable
Skokowski could not hold back

Pennsylvania All-Stars outshoot
U l-Stars 114-78 at Roundball

While Mark Jackson may not be Shaquille O’Neal, you can say that he
has been Shaq more than a few times in the back yard

Standing nearly 7 feet tall, the Philadelphia Roman Catholic center
grew up with visions of the immensely popular and just plain immense
center from Louisiana St. University in his mind.

“I modeled [my game] after Shaquille — I had the knee pads and
everything,” Jackson said. “When I was smaller and quicker, I really pat-
terned my game after Karl Malone, but I kept growing, and I began to
model Shaq.”

For players of his caliber, comparisons to the great centers of the NBA
such as Shaq, Patrick Ewing and David Robinson flow easily off the
tongue. But, according to Jackson, he doesn’t get the respect he
deserves.

“I work too hard not to get respect,” Jackson said.

Having had the opportunity to coach Jackson only once (in
Thursday’s Classic), Steelton Highspire High School head coach Ken
Richter has, as Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said, recognized
greatness. .1.

“He’s got real soft hands and quick fee‘t,~”' Richter said. “He’s great on
the boards and overpowering inside.” J

Jackson, who was “psyched up to go against the elite of the country”
dominated at Thursday night’s 29th Annual Roundball Classic,» scoring

The 29th Annual Asics Roundball Classic
may have lacked the hype, the prestige and
the marquis names of years past. Unlike pre-
vious classics, there were no megastars the
caliber of Shaquille O’Neal, Bobby Hurley,
Chris Webber or Anfernee ‘Hardaway.

Nonetheless, the 22 players that participat-
ed in the 1993 version put on your typical all-
star show — lots of dunks, lots of rejections,
lots of no-look passes and lots of points.
Showtime at its free form best.

The Pennsylvania All-Stars crushed the
United States All-Stars 114-78 in front of 9,851
at the Civic Arena Thursday night. This was
the first year for the Roundball Classic under
new management, and many observers
downplayed the contest due to its declining
reputation among national all—star
classics.With players permitted to participate
in only two all-star games, many of the glam-
our names decided to pass on the Roundball
this year. l

Pennsylvania dominated from start to finish,

Relay teams shine for men's track at Dogwood Relays

By Jason Feuchtwanger
Staﬂ’ Writer

The Pitt men’s track team received two strong perfor-
mances from its relay teams this past weekend at the
always-challenging Dogwood Relays at the University of
Tennessee. 9

The Dogwood Relays showcased some of the best
teams in the country. Squads from the ACC, SEC and Big
Ten conferences along with many other Eastern schools
were in attendance. Besides the famed Penn Relays, this
was the most competitive field the Panthers will face.

“Both relays did really well,” Pitt head coach John
Vasvary said. “The distance medley team took four sec-
onds off their time since their last race.”

The shuttle hurdle relay team (Jonathan Dixon, Jay
Murphy, Wes Alexander and Tim Flanders) ran its fastest

time of the year, finishing in third place with a time of
59.71 seconds. The University of Tennessee won the
event with a time of 57.95 seconds, while Eastern
Kentucky beat Pitt out for second place by one-tenth of a
second._

Mike Umbleby and Devvon Bradley helped the dis-
tance medley team run to its fastest time of the year and
a seventh-place finish with a time of 9 minutes 54.21 sec-
onds. They ran their best times of the year in the 1,200-
meter and the 800—meter runs respectively. Brian Whitley
ran the 400 meter and Frank Nesko anchored the dis-

‘tance medley team with the 1,600-meter run.

Nesko pointed to Umbleby’s lead-off leg as a reason
for the team’s strong showing.

“With the competition that was there, we did pretty
well. Mike put us in a good position,” Nesko said.

“I found a good position on the inside lane and just

ran there for a half [half milel,” Umbleby said.

Umbleby said he feels that the season is still young
and that the team is only going to improve.

“We can run faster [than we did], it’s still "early [in the
seasonl,” Umbleby said. “We can definitely run better.”

On Thursday, two days before the distance medley
team raced, Nesko qualified for the Eastern
Championships (IC4As) in the 5,000-meter’ run.

Vasvary applauded Nesko"s effort. 0

“In indoor he ran his best 3,000 meter in 8 minutes, 27
seconds, and on Thursday at the 3,000—meter mark he

, was at 8 minutes, 28 seconds and still had 2,000 meters

to go,” Vasvary said.

“It shocked me to come through that fast at the 3,000-
meter mark,” Nesko said “The next step is to qualify for
Nationals, but I’m happy with this race.”

surprised himself, garnering the
Pennsylvania All-Star T eam’s Most
Valuable Player Award for the
game against some of the tough-
est competition in the country —
including University of Arkansas
recruit Lee Wilson and Mississippi
St. recruit Erick Dampier.

“They had some pretty big guys
out there,” Jackson said. “I had to
work to hit layups.”

Clearly a force on the glass,
Jackson not only used his wide-
bodied frame to get position but
was the most vocal member of the
team, even going as far as yelling
at Pitt signee Sotiris Aggelou dur-
ing a trip up the court.

“He’s team oriented and he
plays with enthusiasm,” Richter
said. “That’s contagious to a
team.”

Jackson will take his enthusi-

the Rams get high numbers from
Jackson for both their staff and
conference.

With intentions to become a
computer science major, Jackson
was swayed with the school’s
computer department. Another
factor in his decision is the
scenery around the city.

“I love the scenery — it’s a
small town in the south,” Jackson
said. “This isn’t a party school, and
I’m not that interested in stuff like
that.”

While most already believe that
the 260—poun-der will be an
impact player in his first year of
college, Jackson has bypassed
vague aspirations and set strictly
defined goals for his future in
Virginia.

“I want to get 10 [points] and 10
[rebounds] my freshman year,” he
said. “Then I want to increase
them both by five each year after.”

Despite his youth, Jackson
already has his heights set on the
pinnacle of his trade — the NBA.

“Fm determined to get stronger
to make it to the NBA,” he said.

Jackson is still at least three
years away from The Show —
more than enough time to soak
up the college life and get ready
for the pros. But you just don’t
know, in 1996 you may hear the
words Jackson has waited his

. entire life for: “They select, their

Next week, the Panthers
will stay in Oakland-as
they host a meet at Pitt
Stadium on Sunday that
will feature Robert Morris,
Duquesne, Carnegie
Mellon and several other
small local schools.

Included in this meet
will be a chance for all fac-
ulty and staff members to
compete in a 5,000—meter
race that will start at 12:20
p.m.

This will allow the
Panthers to prepare them-
selves for the Penn Relays,
which is the biggest meet
of the year and is held the
last weekend in April.

the UConn charge as he
gave up a double, a walk
and a single that won the
game for the Huskies.
Junker dropped to 3-2 on
the year with the loss.

Pitt stomred back with a
vengeance in the second
half of the twin bill by scor-
ing 14 runs in the first four
innings and put the game
away early. The Panthers
pounded Husky ace pitcher
John Kelly, who gave up 10
runs on 10 hits and left the
game after just two and
one-third innings.

At the start of the second
inning, it was obvious that
the game was quickly get-
ting out of control when the
first seven Panthers that
came to the plate reached
base. Pitt would eventually
score six times in the sec-
ond, providing all the
offense the it would need.
Reese closed out the inning
with a two-run single to
right that gave the Panthers
a 6-0 lead.

The Panthers picked up
right where they left off in
the third inning, as they
added four runs, two on a
two-run double by
Crawley, to increase their
lead to 10-0.

After four more runs in
the fourth inning that gave
the Pitt a 14-0 lead, Crawley
added the final touches in
the seventh inning, as he
delivered a two-run blast
over the left ﬁeld fence —
his first homer of the year.
Panther starter Rob
Hanawalt (1-0) was award-
ed the win, his first of the
season.

The Panthers (19-4, 4-3 in
the Big East) trail the
Huskies (11—7, 5-3) by one-
half game in the race 1for
first place in the conference.
Their next home game is
this Wednesday, when the
take on Akron University at
Trees Field at 3 p.m.

This weekend, the
Panthers will host Big East
rival Seton Hall for a three-
game series.

Philadelphia talent. Three of
Philly’s famed “Fab Five,”
Tyrone Weeks, Alvin Williams
and Marc Jackson, led the
charge, with monster help from
Simon Gratz’s Rhondell Turner.
The quartet combined for 65
points and 50 rebounds.

Jackson easily grabbed Most
Valuable Player honors with a
monster performance, owning
the paint with 18 points and 19
rebounds in just 20 minutes of
action. The 6—foot 10-inch, 260-
pound bull from Philly’s Public
League Champion Roman
Catholic could seemingly do
whatever he wanted, grabbing
boards at will and scoring off a
polished arsenal of post moves.
Jackson will take his powerful
game to Virginia

endless comparisons to Charles
Barkley. Weeks, headed for
John Calipari at Massachusetts,
collected 15 rebounds, while
adding 12 points and four
blocks. Weeks said competing
with city powers like Gratz and
Roman in Philly has taken his
game to new levels.

“Since 10th grade, it’s made
me a better player,” Weeks
said. “It’s hard, but it’s fun,
too.”

Turner, the leading scorer for
USA Today National Champion
Simon Gratz, is still undecided
on a college choice, but it is
obvious he could help a lot of
clubs with his skills.
Overshadowed for his entire
career by teammate Rasheed
Wallace, Turner’s offensive
repertoire includes a number of
strong low-post moves and
deadly accuracy from three-
point range. At 67”, and 235
pounds, Turner is also a demon
on the boards as he grabbed 11
to go with 17 points.

School guard Tom Pipkins, the W'PiAL’s all-time
scoring leader with 2,859 points and the most
ballyhooecl player out of Western Pa. player in at
least a decade, received spirited ovations from
warmups on and did not disappoint.

The dynamic 6‘2“ scoring machine finished
with ll) points, seven rebounds and three assists.
He connected on two of three three-pointers and
displayed his amazing leaping ability with a
breakaway jam early.

On Wednesday night at Fitzgerald Field

House. Pipkins made the Slam Dunk contest his
own personal exhibition, scoring a perfect 50 on
three of his four dunks en route to an easy win.
Pipkins demonstrated phenomenal strength and
elevation for a 6'2” guard, unleashing Dominique
Wilkins and Shawn Kemp-type tomahawk slams.

In addition to Pipkins, Laurel Highlands’ prolif-
ic forward Nick Bosnic also put on an impressive
performance Thursday, chipping in 12 points to
go with seven boards. Bosnic, headed for Gary
Williams‘ Maryland Terrapins, also fared well in
Wednesday’s dunk contest, showing off decep-
tive athletic ability for a pure shooter.

And Pitt recruit Sotiris Aggelou from Riverside
High also dazzled. Wednesday, Aggelou out-
gunned the New Castle tandem of Ricky Steele
and Jason Zarilla to win the three-point
shootout, and Thursday he scored six points and
added three assists in Pennsylvania's rout.
