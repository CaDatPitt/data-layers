(_lnited Way seeks $2million above ’83

The United Way of Southwestern
Pennsylvania kicked off its fund
raising drive with the announcement
of $28.2 million, almost two million
more than the final total raised dur-
ing the 1983 campaign..

United Way Campaign Chairman
Douglas .D. Danforth, chairman
and chief executive officer, Westing-
house Electric Corporation, made
the announcement at a celebration
held -in PPG Plaza on September 6
to more than 500 volunteers and
representatives from local business

Coalition targets

As the November presidential
election draws near, members of the
Pittsburgh Alliance for Voter Regis-
tration/ Project Vote are taking to
the streets in an effort to register at
least 16,000 new voters in Allegheny
County by Oct. 9.

County’s United Way President L.
Stanton Williams, chairman and
chief executive officer of PPG,
eleven reporting divisions who
began their campaigns early,
reported a total of $5,772,348, or
20.5 percent of the goal.

Danforth called the reports a
heartening indication of where this
campaign is headed under the direc-
tion of dedicated and enthusiastic
people. “We are inspired by the
example set by these early reports.
They've proved that it can be
done...now the rest of us have to go
out and finish the job they’ve
started,” he urged. ~ -

“The goal of $28 million plus is the

ing'its drive on low-income, minor-
ity, disabled, unemployed and
young people, according to Volun-

teer Coordinator Frank Kirkland..

“In Allegheny County alone, over
300,000 people are not registered,
most of whom fit those categories,”
he said. 5 _
Kirkland became interested in
Project Vote after working with the
unemployed. “These people are
affected most by government poli-
cies, and yet they don’t vote,”Kirk-

least that is needed to keep pace with
the constantly mounting needs of
our family of agencies, which are
struggling to meet priorities and
provide for demand increases in ser-
vices,” said Danforth.

“This is not just another United
Way Campaign,” he said. “It is a
community crusade to adequately
fund the 100 human care agencies
that help people in need and provide
essential community services.”

Commenting on the losses of the
past two years, Danforth cited
unemployment, layoffs and individ-
ual contrioutions that have not kept
pace with rising costs, as some of the
reasons the campaign fell short.of

P ' tt °
land said. “People in need of jobs
should vote. That’s what politicians
understand, otherwise the people
are ignored."

The Alliance consists of many
community and church organiza-
tions, including Hunger Action
Coalition, Urban League, NAACP,
NOW, ACORN, and the Associa-
tion of Pittsburgh, Priests. These
groups seek new voters at super-
markets, welfare and unemploy-
ment offices, downtown streets,and

goal. .

Danforth told the audience that
we must upgrade our past patterns
of gﬁling. “There is just one way to
get the job done. We must have
stronger commitments and a mone-
tary response that matches the chal-
lenges we face. That means more
working people giving more than
everbefore to make up for those
who are not working...those who
cannot give.”

“I feel confident that this com-
munity will be entirely equal to the_
challenge that lies ahead of us, not
only in this campaign, but for the

— balance of the ’80s. Let"s pull out all

the stops and. get to _work," he

even through door-to-door inquir-
ies, Kirkland explained.

On campus, the registration drive
is being promoted by Rev. Bob
White and the United Campus Min-
istries. “l want to give the students
the opportunity to get increasingly
involved in government and increas-
ingly sensitive to the democratic
process," he said. 5

Rev. White sees the drive as an

extension of his ministry, he
explained. “As a Christian, I believe

concluded.

With a new executive vice presi-
dent, Ralph Dickerson, Jr., at the
helm, the United Way is geared up to
make this the “turn around" year for
the organization. Fifty-seven loaned
executives are working out of the
United Way headquarters person-
ally contacting thousands of busi-
nesses and organizations to
implement fund raising campaigns
among employees. These profes-
sional men and women use their
knowledge and business experien_ce

the people should challenge totali-

sible should vote at election time, he

said. “Apathy and complacency-

cause totalitarianism."

Booths will be set up throughout
campus, including the ground floor
of the Cathedral, the Litchfield
Towers, and Forbes Quad, where
stu_dents can register to vote

So far, the alliance has registered‘ 7 

a total of l3,589 new voters, but as
Rev. White concludes, “We will
never register enough people.” —

NEW YORK (UPI) —— Gold made a
slight gain by closing time yesterday-
while a stars dollar gain controlled
activity on currency exchanges.
Trade was calmer than the day
before, with many investors afraid
to sell, even after overnight interest
rates eased.

New York's Republic Bank closed
cash gold at $339.25 cents, up 50
cents on the day. Silver was down to
$7.18, a drop of only 3 cents.

President Reagan, who has said
he will do every thing in his power to
strengthen markets for American
farmers, agreed yesterday to let
Moscow by moregrain in the second
year of the long-term grain agree-
ment, exists between the United
States and the Soviet Union. The
increase will take effect on Oct. 1.

Reagan has raised the ceiling of
the agreement to 22 metric tons of
wheat and corn. That's an increase
of 10 metric tons per year.

(UPI) —— “Absolutely terrific.”
This was vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro’s first reaction to
news that President Reagan has said
that he will meet with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko. Ferraro
added that "people should not forget
that it took the Reagan administra-
tion three a half years to get around
to meeting with the Kremlin’s top
official. ‘

According to the Orlando Sen-
tinel, the Navy has admitted that
dozens of sailors saw a helicopter
crash in the Atlantic last April but
their superiors did not initiate an
attemnt tn resclle five airmen. At the
time of the crash, the USS Frank
Cable was engaged in a test missile
launching and the search for the air-
men did. not begin until 40 minutes
later. The report released by the
Navy said that the men would have
died anyway.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The
list of bidders for Conrail has been
cut to three, according to Transpor-
tation Secretary Elizabeth Dole. She
also asked the justice and the treas-
ury departments to enter in the case.

Dole said that the three original

offers for the government-owned"

railroad, all exceeding one billion
dollars, have been improved. She
did not elaborate on the
improvements.

The three offers still in contention
for the railroad are from Alleghany
Corporation, a New York-based
holding company; Norfolk South-
ern, the giant railroad; and the Mar-
riot Group, headed by hotel
magnate .I.W. Marriott of Washing-
ton, D.C. - .

Bidders eliminated from conten-
tion were The Railway Labor Exec-
utiives Association, group
representing Conrail employees;
Guilford Transportation Industries,
New Haven, Connecticut-based
firm; and Citicorp, the giant finan-
cial institution.

Dole promised to move “as

A rapidly as possible" to determine the

final bidder.

‘ Show the Cards

Running for president is no idle venture. It is a.war — a

, war of political posturing, of baby kissing and flag wav-

ing. It is also supposed to be a war ofideas and words. But
there definitely seems to be something awry this year. The

“ candidates don’t seem to be talkingto people, or even one

another. .
President Reagan, as the incumbent, is in a position to

. make Mr. Mondale come after him, but once challenged

on the issues, he owes it to his supporters as well as
uncommitted voters to defend himself. Mondale chal-
lenged the president to a series of debates. The president,

4 in his infinite wisdom, decided that it would only bore the
0 public. This implies that after the first debate, the presi-

dent would have nothing new to say to the nation.
This is most unusual, as the president has refused to
‘outline how he is going to reduce the nation’s unprece-
dented budget deficit. He hasn’t said whether he would
increase taxes. Most recently, he has had a change of

.h€aLL.0.Lh.is. conviction that a nuclear war is winnable.

This week’s line, for those keeping score, has the presi-
dent saying it can't be done. But don't give up on those
bomb shelters; there’s still more than eight weeks left
before the elections. _

Walter Mondale has been criticized for not being
“loose” enough, or jovial with reporters, certainly prime
considerations for one who wants to be president, but he

_ has not been criticized for failing to reveal his intentions if

elected president. He has not waged a secret war for the
presidency. In a speech given on Monday in Philadel-
phia, Mondale presented a detailed proposal to reduce
the budget deficit. Mondale was even brave enough to
reveal which income groups would be hit hardest. It
shouldn’t be any surprise that those earning more than
$100,000 a year will be asked to pay a greater percentage
than those at the lower end of the earning scale.

.Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, has been extremely

~ vocal but has said very little. It is high time for the

president to reveal his hand instead of just saying, “we’re
studying that,” or “we have a plan for that,” or “there they
go again.”

To be_reelected, Mr. Reagan is relying so far on a
customized presidency he bought from the image makers
on Madison Avenue. An image wrapped in beautiful
pictures of “America the Heartland" and cowboys in
white hats riding off into the sunset with their best girl by

their side. Now he’s trying to make the American people .

buy what’s under the wrapping paper, sight unseen. The
political battle so far has been one of substance vs. spar-

kle. The popularity contest for class president atAny- _

town High is one thing, but for President of the United

States, it is quite another story.

Letters to   the Editor

  AT&T faces
less bridled
competition.

I am writingin reference to your
article in The Pitt News (Friday,

Sept. 7th) titled “Competitor’s'

invade AT&T’s Campus of the

Future,” and I would like to make a .

few corrections and give, a little
insight to the situation.

The war for long distance calls is
between AT&T and the other com-
mon carriers. The Regional Bell Tel-

ephone Operating Companies,

(RBOC’s) have little to do with the
war except as it pertains to the equal
access.

The main error in‘the article was
the —statement,"‘With the incrasing
rates of AT&T...” AT&T’s Long
Distance rates have not increased,

they have decreased. Local rates '

have increased since the breakup,
and AT&T has nothing to do with
this. This is due _to the. fact that

. before the breakup, AT&T subsid-

ized the local rates with long dis-

— tance revenues, however, since the

breakupoccured, they can no longer
do this.

Even though AT&T has the larg-
est ' share of the long distance
market, they are now being placed in
a competitive disadvantage due to
‘FCC rulings heavily regulating
AT&T, while the other long distance
companies have few regulations.
AT&T has asked to reduce rates and
restructure them and the FCC has
been ‘stalling.

Everyone seems to be blaming
AT&T for the breakup, but the real
fault lies with the-Justice Depart-
ment, Judge Green and the FCC, for

doing this -for the “Public’s best‘-

interest!”

From where I stand/ James Crary

Change in others reveals change in self

When the Buddhist monk from
Sri Lanka came to teach in Pennsyl-
vania, he was indifferent to Ameri-
can commercial culture, preferring
the richness of our autumn to the
commodities in our stores.

Sri Lanka, where Bo Derek filmed

I Tarzan, had been a lush and finan-

cially humble scenario for his obser-

' vations of a life and world both

magnificent and dreadful yet ordi-
nary. Living in an excellent faculty
house never prevented him from eat-

ing on the floor with his fingers. The
food, often a spicy curry, was superi-
or to anything available in most
restaurants.

On lazy fall afternoons, Pennsyl-
vania has spectacular qualities. The
trees are flushed in scarlet and rich
with gold. During these weeks. the
cities are more attractive, ribbed as
they are by season‘s change. Enter-
ing the university setting for the first
time or returning from vacation, one
may have a heightened sense of_a

new environment and seek the
exceptional qualities being offered.
More is changing on campus than
the season. It is crucial that old hab-
its not reassert themselves, thereby
desensitizing us to change. The cam-
pus is a place in part for future-
gazing. The libraries here are putting
holdings on-line so that other librar-
ies, internationally, will have access
to our books and we will have access
to works held in other libraries.
The student body has acquired an

FM radio station, WPTS 98.5,
which has reportedly been received
20 miles away. The very notion of
this university as a “campus of the
future" has been institutionalized by
our ongoing commitment to change
and requires an adaptable vision.
Dharm, my Buddhist friend,
began over time to understand the
appeal of American culture in a way
he had not expected, just as many of
his students, at first intimidated by
his alien ways, were able to accept

and, in some cases, assimilate the
approach he must take to the world.

Here at Pitt, so many different
kinds of people are looking for many
different answers to questions, both
academic and economic, that we
must be careful to remember that
our way of doing things is not the
only way. While the qualities of

Electrifying

WPTS   overhaul excites staff

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

There’s a feeling of excitement
invading the fourth floor ofthe Wil-
liam Pitt Union, and it may have a
lot to do with the complete overhaul
of the student radio station. This
year, WPTS; the Pitt radio station,
has switched to FM and undergone
some format and personnel changes.

One of the new people on the

management staff is Tom Walsh,
who took over as sports director on
Aug. 7. Walsh was on the staff last
year as a sports disc jockey and is

overwhelmed by the changes in the

department.

“Comparing last year’s sports
[department] to this year’, people
will actually be working. Instead of
reading stories over the air, they will
be going out and getting them,”
Walsh said.

. ball.

One sport that will be new to
WPTS coverage this fall is Pitt foot-
The station worked out an
agreement with WTAE that says

_ they will be able to carry the games
as long as the only promotion they

do is on the air or in The Pitt News.
There is also another new twist to
WPTS sports. They will be permit-
ted to cover all 54_basketball games
(27 men’s and 27 women’s), both
home and away. Right now, the
radio station doesn’t know specifi-
cally who will be doing these games,
but Walsh is optimistic about find-
ing broadcasters for the games.
“We are auditioning people cur-
rently for doing games. We need
basically four people. I have myself
for men’s play-by-play, and that’s
it.” .
Since the radio-station went FM,
there has been increased supervision
by the administration. This may be

causing some discomfort. Wilfred‘

Tremblay, assistant director of Stu-
dent Activities for student media
and publications, has taken over as
General Manager — a position pre-
viously held by a student.

Walsh seems unfazed by the admi-
nistrative supervision. “The admin-
istration factor hasn’t affected me at
all. I’m very comfortable with what
,I’m doing."'

Another member of the staff that
seems comfortable is News Director
Mary Doorley. A newcomer to Pitt,
Doorley is extremely impressed with
the hard work done by the students
here.

“I haven't been involved with stu-
dent media since college, but I didn’t
see this kind of enthusiasm at my

W College. The exciting thing is seeing
these people going ahead in leaps
and bounds — doing it by them-
selves. We are giving them the tools,
and they’re inhaling it,” Doorley
said. ‘ .

Assistant News Director Rachel
Oswith agreed. “There's such a
change from last year; I’m really
excited. The students come in here
so enthusiastic. We’re caught up in
the atmosphere.”

Station listeners seem to be
caught in this whirlwind, too. Staff
member _ Mary Daigle says that
requests are up significantly, and
Promotions Director Saul Marko-

. witz can attest to it.

“A lot of people have been win-
ning our give-aways,”. Markowitz
said. “And not just my friends. We
never had callers before."

There is also a big increase in the

number of people interested in .

working at the station. According to
Daigle, there was a significant
number of interested people signed
up after the freshman activities fair.
“There’s definitely an increase in
interest. Most people didn’t even
know we had an AM station or
couldn’t get it,” said Daigle. “Now
that they can hear the station, they
want to come up and be a radio star.
The fact that we can be heard has
brought tremendous response."

The Allegheny County Health
I Department has begun its annual flu
immunization program for chroni-

Lunch crowd

to discuss

Thirteen lunchtime discussions,
based on the television series “The
Constitution: That Delicate Bal-

-ance” and sponsored by the Pitts-

burgh Council on Higher
Education, will begin on Wednes-
day, September 19 at Kaufmann’s,
downtown.

Each discussion, free and open to
the public, will examine vital public
policy problems arising from consti-
tutional issues. The topics for each
session will be determined by the
previous evening’s broadcast on

will be members of the Duquesne
University faculty.

Sessions will begin at 12:15 p.m.

the Presidency and the Congress,
gun control and’ school prayer. The
faculty discussion leaders represent

ledgeable in the field,” said Donn C.

the Pittsburgh Council on Higher
Education. “Here is an opportunity
to do just that.”

The discussion series at Kauf-
mann’s is the first public event of a

Who’s Rea

F ritzbusters

(UNITED STUDENT PRESS
SERVICE) — All the major media
said that the Republican National
Convention in Dallas would be
planned down to the last minute
weeks in advance. There would be
no_imagination, no spontaneity, and
above all, no surprises. But that was
before the “Fritzbusters” came to
town.

Billing themselves as “the world’s
first demolasmic removal service"
and taking off on the smash summer
film “Ghostbusters,” a team of four
Fritzbusters and 32 College Repub-
lican cheerleaders made campaign
appearances before the President,
the Vice President and enthusiastic
crowds all over Dallas.

The Fritzbusters made their first

October, and November occupancy.

stop on Friday, August 17, before
500 Youth for Reagan-Bush volun-
teers. “It was really just a warm-up
stop,” said Chief Buster Paul Erick-
son, “but we sold $900 worth of
Fritzbusters T-shirts in 10 minutes.”
At that point we knew that we _were
on to something.

On the following Sunday, the
Fritzbusters went to kick off the
convention at an arrival rally for
Vice President George Bush, despite
some problems with Bush’s security
managers. According to Erick-
son,“The Secret Service was less
than thrilled to hear ofa last-minute
addition to the program in which an
ambulance with sirens blazing
would pull up, the ambuIence’s rear
door would kick open, and four
young people dressed in combat
fatigues and wearing backpacks
would jump out, dance and point
strange hoses in the general direc-
tion of the Vice President. But the
crowd went nuts.”

The Fritzbusters ran an arrival
rally of their own on Monday,
August 20, for opening night at the
convention. Once again, they went
into their commercial-like pitch,
“When you see the specter of a lib-
eral Democrat, don’t wasteanother
minute waiting for disaster —— call
the professionals, the Fritzbusters,
right away,” an act which they fol-
lowed with an improvised song to
the theme from “Ghostbusters.”
And once again, their performance
was to the slight chagrin of the
Secret Service.

Even so, “the only real fear was

i that Bert Lance would come and

slime us,” said Collen Morrow,
executive director of the College
Republican National Committee
and an Ohio delegate to the
convention. ,
The Fritzbusters spent the rest of
the week making apperances at
Republican rallies, fundraisers, bar-
becues, some of which were open by

invitation only. But lack of invita- ’

tions didn’t stop the Fritzbusters.
‘‘_It’s amazing where you can go
when you have an ambulance with
the lights on,” one Fritzbuster told
USPS. _ -
At a Tuesday rally the Fritzbus-
ters sound system broke down, so
leader Paul Erickson was forced to
go into an impromptu routine telling
the crowd that they could call 1-800-
MBUSTERS to get their own Fritz-
busting ragalia with the official “No
Fritz” insignia. At the time, Erick-
son was unaware that the number
had not yet been connected. He dis-
covered his mistake when an irate
executive with WNBC called the
next day to say that he had to hire

 three extra operators to handle the

rush of calls for more information
when his station audience found that
the number did not work. Fortu-
nately, the line was up and working
by the time the number appeared in
a USA TODA Ypiece, and it’s been
ringing steadily ever since.- '

The climax of the Fritzbusters
campaign came when they went on
to warm up a crowd of 12,000 ten
minutes before the president was
scheduled to speak. “After that, the
campaign people loved us,” said
Jack Abramoff, Chairman of the
College Republican National Com-
mittee, “they even let us set up in
front of the podium when President
Reagan made his acceptance speech
on national TV that night.”

Much of the excitement is over
now, but for Paul Erickson, the trip
to Dallas was well worthwhile.
“Fritzbustin' makes me feel good,”
he said.

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. (UPI)
— Penn State coach Joe Paterno
said his Nittany Lions may be over-
matched when they meet fifth-
ranked Iowa Saturday on theroad.

The Hawkeyes demolished Iowa
State last week 59-21, scoring 42
points by halftime.

Paterno said Iowa looked awe-
some against the Cyclones. He was
especially impressed with the Hawk-
eye defense. saying the unit was as
good as he has seen in a long time.

Paterno further said he did not
know if his team ‘was experienced
enough to tackle a team as tough as
Iowa. ‘‘I‘m afraid we’re going to be
overmatciied this week," Paterno
hinted. t

The Nittany Lions slipped in the
polls from seventh to 13th following
last Saturday’s I5-I2 victory over
Rutgers in Beaver Stadium.

Their offense struggled and their
defense, while limiting the Scarlet
Knights to just 202 total yards, did
not grade out that well with Paterno
and his staff on film.

Tailback D.J. Dozier was one of a
number of players who were injured
in the Rutger game. He suffered a
pulled groin muscle. His status for
the Iowa game is still uncertain

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —— A trial
date has been set in the case of four
Duquesiie basketball players
accused in the rape of an I8-year-old
female business student last spring
in a campus dormitory. Emmet
Sellers, Ronnie Stevenson, Greg
Harrison and Eric Compton were
arrested after the woman filed a
complaint, and are set to go on trial
January 7 in Allegheny County
Criminal Court. V

A student at the Wilma Boyd
Career School who had been resid-
ing on campus told police she was

, raped at about 2:30 a.m. on May 15

when she went to the 14th floor of

St. Martin Hall to look for a girl-

friend.

ST. LOUIS (UPI) — Two former
western Pennsylvania athletes spent
Tuesday packing their bags to move
to another city. The St. Louis Cardi-
nals dealt pitcher John Stuper of
nearby Butler, Pa. to the Cincinnati
Reds to complete a deal in which the
Cardinals acquired switch-hitting
utilityman Paul Householder.
Stuper was 3-5 in mostly relief
appearances for the Cardinals this‘
season.

MIAMI (UPI) —— The Miami
Dolphins acquired Uniontown's
Chuck Muncie from the San Diego
Chargers in exchange for an undis-
closed draft choice. Muncie, a vete-
ran running back, is expected to
replace the injured Andra Franklin
in the Dolphins’ lineup. Franklin
injured his knee Sunday and will be
lost for the season. -

College Football

NEW YORK (UPI) — Nebraska
regained the position that many peo-
ple have become accustomed to see-
ing it in. The UPI Board of Coaches
put Nebraska back on top of the
college football ratings. The Corn-
huskers repalced Miami which was
upset by Michigan last Saturday.

The Pitt Panthers dropped out of
the rankings while Brigham Young
continued to look impressive witlh a
47-l3_romp over Baylor, moving up
to the sixth slot. Oklahoma comes to
Pitt Stadium this Saturday to Chal-
lenge the Panthers. Pitt is a 3 ‘/2 point

New Year, Old Stuff

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

Being the first column of the aca-
demic year, one might expect to find
something new and interesting here.
Unfortunately, it looks like the same
old stuff. .

0 Starting close to home, it looks
like the Pittsburgh Maulers may be
mauling [or vice versa] next year
without Heisman Trophy winner

7 Mike Rozier.

Rozier, who signed a three-year,

I $3.1 million deal with the Maulers,

seems to have decided to leave the
Steel City for the wide, open spaces
of Texas, namely Houston, a team
whose record is much like that of the
Maulers.’ I

The Maulers seemed ready to part
with their prize rutming back from
Nebraska last month if Rozier
would return $1.6 million ofthe$l.9
million paid to him. From his per-.
formance last season, Rozier was
lucky that they didn't ask for $1.9
million of $1.9 million back.

Now’it seems that the Maulers are
done messing around and are going
to play hardball. George Heddles-
ton, general manager of the Maul-
ers, said Wednesday that Rozier

doesn’t have a leg to stand or run on, '

however the case may be. Heddle-
ston finally reminded, everybody
that Rozier has a contract to play
football with the Maulers and that if
the Maulers owner, Edward DeBar-
tolo, doesn't want to let Rozierjurnp
ship, he has little choice.

“None, if Mr. DeBartolo does not ,

choose to work out a way,” said
Heddleston.

So tune in tomorrow for the con-
tinuing story of the poor city kid
from Camden, N.J., strugglingto
find happiness, more money and
most important of all, a real offen-
sive line on “As the Pigskin Turns.”

0 Joke of the day: Did you hear
the one about Penn State being
ranked twelfth? After that nip and
tuck battle the Nittany Lions had
with national football power
Rutgers (Rutgers?!) before downing
them.l5-12, elevated Penn State to

the spot while dropping Pitt to‘ the ‘

No. 17 slot.

Penn State will not have to wait
long for a chance to defend this rat-
ing as they travel to Iowa this week-
end to take on the Hawkeyes.

\

Moore Ideas

Iowa, ranked fifth in the nation,
will be ready for the Lions this year
after underestimating them last sea-
son before pulling outa 42-34 mara-
thon win at State College. Favored

by six" points and on home turf, the ‘

Hawkeyes look like a sure thing.
Their defense forced eight turnovers
last week, and their offfnse con-
verted six of them into points in a
59-21 trouncing of Iowa State last
week. a

Penn State quarterback Doug
Strang, who completed 7 of,20
passes for 50 yards against Rutgers,
looks to have a long day again, espe-

, cially if sophomore running back

DJ. Dozier is unable to start. Doz-

ier gained 97 yards against the Sca-
rlet Knights but had to leave the
game twice due to a stiff shoulder
and a pulled abdominal muscle. He
is probable for Saturday’s contest.

The Hawkeyes are sure of it.

0 A new superstition to add to
walking under ladders and black
cats; don’t become a running back
for the Miami Dolphins. ’

The Dolphins, who are 2-0 behind
the passing of Dan Marino, aren’t
having much luck keeping personnel
in the backfield. The first loss to the
Miami ground game came in the off-
season when David _Overstreet was
killed in an automobile accident.
The latest casuality came last Sun-
day when fullback Andra Franklin

went down against the Patriots with '

ligament and cartilage damage, side-
lining him for the season.

The new kid on the block is an old
kid. Miami traded a second-round
draft pick in 1985 to the San Diego
Chargers for Chuck Muncie.

Muncie, who has a history of drug
abuse, missed a team flight to Seattle
where the Chargers lost to the Sea-
hawks on Sunday. On Tuesday, he
was sent packing. When asked about
.Muncie’s previous discipline prob-
lems, Shula said, “I’m in a position
where I can’t be choosy and I’m
going to take a chance.”

Nice guy, that Shula. Really.

makes‘ you feel at home.

0 Quote of the day. L65 Angeles
Rams coach John Robinson com-
menting on his offense, or more
appropriately, lack of it: “We have
to look for simple answers, as
opposed to cosmic forces that
affected us."’. »

Can’t tell that guy is from Califor-
nia. No Way. 5

Krista Ziener hurt her ankle the
first day back from another
injury.

Two freshmen had changes of
heart; Lisa Villani signed aschol—
arship but decided that Pitt was
too far from her native Canada,
and another player quit after one
week ofipractice. Marcy Cotters,
who played on the team last sea-
. son, is academically ineligible..

Collier said that the team’s
long term goals would not be

as

affected by the current health

problems, even though he will
have only nine players on his ros-
ter when they are all healthy
‘again.

“Our goals are to win the Big‘

East and to be a factor at Nation-
als,” Collier stated. “Also, to
improve as a team as much as we
can, individually and as a small
group. -

“The people we have realize
that we. may have to win the Big
East championship without
some of our ‘best players,” he
continued. He said that his team
is playing better ‘defense, and

  News,    

  Spikers Hurting  

thn‘ setters Rupp and Young
“have shown really good
improvements” over last season.
“Last year, they. were having
growing pains,” Collier said. He
noted that, as a team, “We didn‘t
improve as much as last year for
anumber of reasons, but I’m not
sure what they are. Last year is
hard to evaluate because we were
upset in one match [by Provi-
dence in the Big East ﬁnal]. ”

GAME SERVES: Collier held
clinics for players and coaches
Saturday, before and after the
alumni match. He said that the
high school clinic was a “help ses-
sion” to supply information
about strategies for getting
scholarships and what to say in
interviews with coaches.
“Volleyball is a supplement to
your education,” he told players.
“A scholarship is one factor, not.
the only factor,” in determining
where to attend college. “It’s not
worth happiness or choosing the
wrong school for the sake of
money. You can’t compare your-
self to others around and the
team — you must be happy.”

     

 

‘Sophomore Kris Wexell is one of four volleyball players currently sidelined.
