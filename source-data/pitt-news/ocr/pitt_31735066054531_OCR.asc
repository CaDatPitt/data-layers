Senate Council votes to allow UPMC to keep name

reg Fischer

   

A motion which would have
revoked the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center’s right to use Pitt’s
name in its title was defeated in yester-
day’s University Senate Council meet-
ing.

The motion, first presented at the
May 13 council meeting by former
member Christina Paulston, was
designed to separate the ﬁnancial inter-
ests of the Medical Center from the
academic interests of the University.

“I don’t see why a business concern
[like UPMC] should be associated with
the University,” said Paulston. “Pitt’s
name is about ideas, not money. There
are no principles involved [in using the

name] other than Pitt’s gross se1f-inter-
est.”

Debate on the topic centered most-
ly around the question of what would
become of Pitt’s public image if it dis-
associated itself from the Medical
Center.

According to Senate Council presi-
dent Keith McDuffie, because the com-
munity doesn’t realize the relationship
between UPMC and Pitt, actions taken
by UPMC that receive bad press reflect
poorly on Pitt’s public image.

“The problem may come with the
idea that UPMC is part of the
University, when it is in fact, a private
corporation,” said McDuffie.

McDufﬁe noted land acquisitions
made by UPMC as one factor which
could be looked on negatively as anoth-

er “land grab” by Pitt.

“People see UPMC buying up land
and hospitals and think it is the
University,_” said McDuffie. “It isn’t the
University’s money being used, howev-
er; it is the private.corporation’s.”

Council members opposed to the
motion said UPMC gives Pitt a better
public image and helps the University
get more money in donations for its
schools.

“I feel it would be a public rela-
tions disaster to separate our ties with
UPMC,” said Gerald Holder, dean of
the school of engineering. “Our rela-
tionship with them is extremely posi-
t1ve.”

According to McDuffie, Pitt’s rela-
tionship with the Medical Center is
good for Pitt because of national and

local advertising based on UPMC’s
good reputation.

Although Pitt and UPMC aren’t
run by the same administrations,
McDuffie said they aren’t totally unre-
lated to the point of not using the Pitt
name.

“A lot of Pitt faculty teach in the
Medical School,” said McDuffie, offer-
ing one major relation between the two
organizations. Holder also related
information about fund-raising efforts
his school is conducting jointly with
UPMC.

In spite of these relations, Paulston
remained unmoved on her feelings
toward the issue.

“I don’t see why we have to give
Pitt’s name for money concerns,” she
said.

Political advertising is at
its highest point since the cam-
paign season began. And would
you believe that the candidates
are actually after the youth vote?

Clinton is leading the pack
this week with advertising geared
towards the 18- to 29-year-old
vote. This is very positive, con-
sidering that before the Oct. 6
debates there were not many ads running
by either of the candidates explaining
what they were going to do for “genera-
tion X.”

The problem is that young voters do
not have a single “identity.” Therefore
the campaigns do not know exactly what
we want —- or how to cater to it. Many
candidates know that we can be a “swing
vote,” whose sway in either direction
could determine the outcome of the elec-
tion.

Bush in
1992. In that
election more
18- to 29-
year-olds
turned out at
1 the polls than
at any time in
the last 20
years, handing
Clinton a 44 to 33 per-
cent victory over Bush
in 1992,” said Alex
Abrahms, of the Rock
the Vote foundation.
Abrahms said
Clinton also carried 50 per-
cent of all voters under the
age of 25 (Bush

cent, Perot
received 20
percent), and

that Clinton’s
20 percent mar-
gin over Bush
was the largest of any major age group.

The 18- to 29-year-old vote did not
just help the Democrats into the
Presidency, it also helped the
Republicans stay in office for 12 years.

According to a Rock the Vote statis-
tic, “in 1984 nearly 60 percent of 18- to
29-year-olds cast their ballot for Ronald
Reagan; similarly, Bush enjoyed a 10
percent triumph in the 1988 election over
Dukakis.”

Practice looking both ways

By Wednesday morning it will
be a necessity.

According to Bob Harkins,
director of parking and trans-
portation at Pitt, workers will
begin the process of re-opening
the road shortly after evening
rush hour ends today. These
workers will be removing road
markings and signs, re-setting
the traffic signals and moving
the barriers so that Bigelow
can open on schedule by mid-
night.

Harkins said that early
studies show that traffic moved
better than predicted during the
trial closing. ‘‘I’m very proud
of the effort that everyone has
made to make this run smooth-
ly,” said Harkins.

However, peop1e’s effort
during the closing isn’t what
will close the road for good. “If
the students really want this to
happen, they need to write to

WEATHER

their council people. The other
side did this during the closing
and this is all that council is
seeing — tons of mail wanting
it to stay open,” Harkins said.

The Chief of Pitt’s Police
Force, Rick Boyd, also feels
that the trial closure worked. “I
think it was a huge success in
terms of demonstrating that the
road can be closed safely and
without the traffic tie-ups that
were predicted,” he said.

Boyd also suggested stu-
dents call or write City Council
to voice their opinions, but
offered a warning about trying
to take closing the road into
their own hands.

“The test closure was so
successful that students would
be creating a situation that
would harm the chances of a
permanent closing by blocking
the road themselves,” said
Boyd. “If you care about the
school and want the road
closed, take a positive action
such as letter writing — don’t
block the road.”

NEW DELHI, India —— The 22-day Miss

this November. However, the swimsuit portion
will not even take place in India. Protesters
caused organizers to move the swimsuit corn-

northeast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

“We will not allow the show to be held

NEW YORK —- According to Newsweek,
James Riady, an Indonesian billionaire who
owns the Lippo Bank, has received letters of
credit for $900,000 from the Import—Export
Bank in Washington. Republicans have
attacked his close ties to President Clinton, say-
ing that Riady has exerted inﬂuence over
Clinton by contributing to his political causes
and his inauguration.

Most of the attention in this centers around
John Huang, finance chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. He was for-
merly vice chainnan of Lippo’s Califomia
banking subsidiary.

According to Newsweek, Huang has
raised millions of dollars from Asian sources
for Clinton’s re-election bid. This includes a

Future of reformed student
loans comes into question

 

The most successful student loan
reform in years is currently standing on the
edge of elimination, according to a political
watchdog group called Citizen Action.

Before this reform, student loans
administered by the Federal Family
Education I.oan Program gave banks the
guarantees and subsidies needed to provide
loans to students. Under this system, after
graduation students then work on repaying
their loans and the interest that has accumu-
lated.

years, direct lending has eliminated millions
of dollars of corporate subsidies and adrnin—
istrative costs. Political Action Committees
representing banks and other ﬁnancial inter-
ests that participate in the student loan
industry spent nearly $2.3 million lobbying
against direct loans in Congress.

Many schools, such as Pitt, have hesi-
tated to offer the option of ' direct loans.
Twice, the 104th Congress has proposed
eliminating the direct student loan reform to
preserve and expand corporate subsidies. It
has become a political debate.

Democrats are generally in favor of

The reform came under the title of direct lending due to the ease it offers to stu-
direct student loans. The process was sirni— dents. Republicans are generally opposed,

loans, the loan is given to the student’s insti-
tution. With less paperwork, and no bank
acting as the middleman, this process is eas-
ier for the student. It also provides a larger
variety of repayment plans to the graduate.

Until 1993, when direct student loans
were ﬁrst created, banks held the monopoly
on lending. They controlled the interest rate
ontheloanandcreatedjobs withinthebank
speciﬁcally for these types of loans.

VVrth the birth of this reform, interest
rateshavedroppedtokeepupwiththe
growing competition of schools offering
this program. In either program, the students
involved have paid hundreds less in taxable
fees to borrow money for school.

Direct lending is actively opposed by
banks and student loan guarantee agencies
that beneﬁt from goverrnnent subsidies
from the FFEL“prograrn In the past three

But already, the direct loan program
has saved money by streamlining the num-
ber of people involved in the process.
According to the National Association of
Graduate and Professional Students, the
FFEL program, as run by the banking
industry, currently employs 25 percent more
people than work for the entire Department
of Education.

“With just one form, automatic consoli-
dation, and directly transferred funds, direct
loans are easier to administer and are avail-
able at the beginning of the school year.
Often times, FFEL loans are delayed.

If Clinton is re-elected, the direct stu-
dent loan will most likely continue to be
debated within Congress for another four
years. The Student Government Board will
then re-propose the idea of direct loans to
the University.

Campaign

“Had it not been for the support
of these young voters, Clinton might
never have made it to the Oval
Office,” Abrahms said.

Though some ads deal with
issues that are important to every-
body, most still focus on the 50 years
and older group. There are some
political ads in the media mentioning
issues of concern to young voters,
such as college financial aid, job
security, education, and health care,
but few political ads are focused
directly at young voters.

According to David Jones, a
graduate student studying American
mass politics, this may be the result
of having little focus ourselves.

“We as ‘generation X’ do not
have an identity and we are not a
political force,” said Jones.
“Therefore, groups like the

 

American Association for Retired
Persons get a lot of attention. They
are strong voters with a voting
block.”

Of course, even if a political ad
tries to grab the young vote, it does
not always mean the candidate will
follow through on his promises.

“The young vote did make a dif-
ference in the 1992 campaign help-
ing Clinton to win, [but he] might
have student loan cuts and the
AmeriCorps program taken away
because of cuts made in the budget,”
Jones said.

The budget for things like stu-
dent loans, AmeriCorps, student
grants, and elementary and sec-
ondary education is only given 2 per-
cent of the tax dollar, while seniors

The closing went so
well that it even changed
the mind of a local busi-

ness owner. Chas
Bonasorte, owner of the
Pitt Stop, the Pitt clothing
store on the corner of
Bigelow and Forbes didn’t
like the idea of the shut-
down when he first heard
it.

“At first I was opposed
to the closing, but after
seeing how smoothly the
test went, my mind’s
changed,” said Bonasorte.
“It would make for a better
campus for our students
and that’s all that matters.”

Michelle Smithwick, a
Pitt senior and commuter,
said that she supports a
permanent closing even
though it makes her trek to
school bit longer.

“I don’t like it because
I’m a commuter. But for
safety, a permanent closing

would be good — just an

inconvenience,” she said.
Not all Pitt students
think the closing was good.

who lives on campus, said
he thinks the general apa-

thy of the Pitt population
shined gloriously during
the closing.

“I don’t think the stu-
dent population supported
it a lot,” said Rhoads. “It’s
like we were studying for a
test — support for the clos-
ing is a last-minute thing. I
don’t think the students
care enough to keep it
closed. Nobody did any-
thing during the closing —
now they’re rushing to get
something done on the last
day it’s closed.”

The last—minute effort
that Rhoads was speaking
of is occurring today from
4 p.m. until 11 p.m. on the
Cathedral lawn. The rally
will consist of four bands,
speakers, the Campus
Fools, poetry and an open
stage for acoustic perform-
ers.

If you want Bigelow to
be closed permanently,
show your support at the
rally or by writing or call-
ing City Council. Don’t let
this important decision be
left to people that don’t
even spend their time in
Oakland.

Jones said students and
younger voters should
become more involved in the
political process and get
more knowledge about such
information.

“In order for the youth to
get more attention it is
important to let the govern-
ment know that we care not
just in the election, but when
congress goes to make a cut
in a program [affecting us]”
Jones said, “We [should]
protest or show whoever was
responsible for the cut that,
in the next election we, as a
group, did notice what hap-
pened and that we do care.”

Political ads are being
geared at the 18- to 29-year-
old vote in a variety of com-
mercials, appearances at uni-
versities, MTV, the debates,
and the internet.

Clinton marketed himself
on MTV in 1992, attempting
to appeal to young people by
playing the saxophone and
answering young voters’
questions. Later, he appealed

to the 18- to 29-year-old
group by talking to reporter
Tabitha Soren on the Choose
or Lose bus. Clinton
appeared very laid—back and
was forward about his atten-
tion to the youth of America
and what his agenda was for
the future.

Perot also made an
appearance on MTV, and
even threw Tabitha some of
his favorite one-liners —-
“We’re not rabbits. Just get-
ting drunk, getting high, get-
ting laid, and getting preg-
nant is not the key to a great
new country.” Perot is trying
to appeal to young voters by
making it clear that the most
dangerous aspects of society
are pregnancy, drugs, and
alcohol —- all problems that
directly affect young people.

Dole has made the most
effort to appeal and let the
young voters know he wants
their vote for the presidency.
From the beginning of his
nomination, Dole made it
clear the youth vote is impor-
tant. He appeared on the
David Letterman Show to
distance himself from a
stodgy old—man appearance

 

7  FROM PAGE 3  I 

and put an animated, light-
hearted Dole on display for
the young audience.

Dole also made an appeal
to the young when, in his last
three minutes of the debate,
he talked about his web site
on the internet and his plan
for the presidency in the year
2000 in regard to younger
people.

The internet itself is a
huge forum for advertise-
ments for the candidates.
There are numerous and
sundry web pages that tell
you anything from a candi-
date’s platforms to his career
and past accomplishments.

Currently, Dole only
trails Clinton by 10 percent
of the young vote, according
to a CNN—Gallup poll which
suggests that getting a large
portion of the young vote is
well within reach for Dole.

“The 18- to 29-year-old
vote is a swing vote because
they do not necessarily stick
with one party. That is why it
is crucial for Dole to get this
vote,” said Jones. “If it is a
close race like the last presi-
dential election, who knows
what could happen?”

UPMC should live
up to its name

Give us a “U!” Give us a “P!” The Senate Council has
vetoed a proposal that the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
be forced to remove the “University of Pittsburgh” from its name.

There has been some confusion about which is which, and
whether or not UPMC is actually a part of the University.
However, UPMC is not a part of Pitt.

If UPMC wishes to continue using Pitt’s name, it should
cooperate more with the University. Let’s face it, the University
and UPMC do not have the best relationship when it comes to
working together, and UPMC has been known to take advantage
of its greater wealth to get what it wants.

The bidding war over the parking lot where the Syria
Mosque once stood is a prime example of the David and Goliath
struggle between Pitt and UPMC. The Medical Center drove bid-
ding up to such outrageous levels that the University could not
compete. Pitt bid $5 million, and UPMC bid $10 million. Now,
after winning the bid, UPMC has offered to sell the parking lot to
the University for $13 million. Unfortunately, our little sling was
not enough to beat this hulking giant.

Now, if UPMC hadn’t used our name and completely sepa-
rated itself from the University, this simply would have been a
competition between two corporations. However, UPMC does
useournarneand shouldatleastbefairtous,ifnotdownright
grateful that we let them use it

If UPMC wants to continue to use the University of
Pittsburgh as a part of its moniker, then it should try to integrate
more with Pitt. Instead of locking us out of the bidding over the
parking lot, it should consider giving us shared usage of it. Though
UPMC is a separate entity from the University, its usage of our
name means that it reﬂects on us. If UPMC screws up, it’s our
name that gets dragged through the mud.

IfUPMC wants to keep the “U” and the “P” in its name by
treating the University as a partner. and cooperating with us, we
will give it three cheers. Until then, we must say, "l‘sk, tsk, dirty
pool, guys.”

Taking an Advil gets kids in trouble?

 

I was, reading Sunday’s Post-
Gazette, when BAM! Like a light-
ning bolt straight from hell, I was
knocked off-kilter by an article enti-
tled “Fearing suits schools ban legal
drugs” by Rene Sanchez and Victoria
Benning of The Washington Post.

It was about a growing trend in
middle schools and junior high
schools to have drug dogs sniﬁ for
banned substances. These substances
range from cocaine to Advil and
Midol. Wait a minute, Advil and
Midol?! A junior high student in Ohio
was suspended for giving Midol to a
friend. Another in suburban Houston
was suspended for having Advil in
her locker for personal use.
According to the article, these
instances are not rare.

Administrators fear that if stu-
dents are harmed by legal medica-
tion, they would be blamed and sued.
Anne Bryant, the executive director
of the National School Boards
Association was quoted as saying, “If
we’re going to have strong drug-free
policies, we can’t start quibbling over
which drugs we’re going to count and
which ones we aren’t. That would be
a nightmare. Even something like
Advil. What if a student gave it to
another student who had a serious
allergic reaction to it? What would
the parents do or say then?”

I feel like the ridiculousness of
these sentiments are obvious, but
since I’m so enraged, I’m going to
stand on my proverbial soapbox for a
few stanzas and let it all hang out.

At a junior—high level of educa-
tion, students have a fair idea what
their allergies are. Painkiller allergies
are fairly rare, and even more rarely

are they severe. They do exist, but in
small numbers. Not only are we talk-
ing about an uncommon allergy, but
for Bryant’s fear to be realized, it
would have to be an undiscovered
rare allergy. It might be better to dis-
cover this allergy at school rather
than at home where an ambulance
might take 20 minutes to arrive. This
policy tries to solve problems that
don’t exist. If we are seriously wor-
ried about violent allergic reactions,
why don’t we ban school lunches?
Food allergies are much more com-
mon and often more dangerous.
Force everyone to bring his own
lunch and suspend people for sharing.
“With this line of reasoning, we had
better ban hot water in the bathrooms
and showers because kids might brnn
themselves. No more home econom-
ics ‘either. Too many hot stoves and
potentially deadly foods. One can see
where this kind of reasoning leads, to
a kind of ridiculous, totalitarian silli-
ness.

The second reasoning error is the
“zero—tolerance” attitude portrayed
by Bryant. When Bryant said that we
can’t quibble about which drugs to
allow, she missed a line that’s already
been drawn by the F.D.A and the
D.E.A. It doesn’t take a genius; ban
the illegal ones and allow the legal
ones. If she wants to be in the position
to decide which drugs are appropri-
ate, she should be working for the
F.D.A. Instead of banning just contro-
versial books, why don’t we ban all
of them? No more Encyclopedia
Britannica, kids might look up sex.
Ladies and gentleman, this is the
snowball effect in our backyards. For
crying out loud, where does it stop?
This reasoning is pure, unadulterated
idiocy.

On the other hand. adrninistra—

tors are justiﬁably terrified of law-
suits. Suppose a student died from
such a thing. It would be a travesty,
but still a faultless accident.
Hopefully, any self-respecting judge
would toss this case out the door. Any
imaginable case involving a severe
allergy, unless the student was
chained up and Advil was forced
down his throat, shows no negligence
on the part of the administrator. That
the allergy was discovered at the
school is irrelevant. Unfortunately,
this country’s judicial system gets
stuck in legal loop-holes that benefit
frivolous cases. The answer is to sup-
port court reform, and not submit to
the tyranny that litigation has
become.

I could perhaps see something
worthwhile in this attitude if the sus-
pensions were in reference to a
painkiller addiction. But primarily,
they are not. Even if they were, this
reasoning is not sound. Since every
object in existence has a good and
evil application, it makes no sense to
ban something with perfectly good
applications because of a few who
misuse it. The Bible could be used as
a weapon. Suspend students for their
actions, not legal possessions.

In conclusion, this is the kind of
attitude that impairs human decency
and common sense. It sends a mes-
sage that it is not OK to help a friend
in need. It perpetuates the rain forest
torrent of apathy on our glowing
ember of kindness. If our decency
hasn’t already burned out, stop kick-
ing it while it’s down, and if it has,
there’s no sense in beating a dead
horse, especially one were trying to
revive!

Jay DeMartino thinks that Valium
should be legalized for people who
worry about these invented problems.

 

SPORTS

Yinz all see
do Stillers?

 

Yinz shoulda seen that dere
game yesterday.

All of Tree Rivers Stadium was
rockin’ like Joe Grushecky and
Donnie Iris as ‘dem Stillers beat up
on da Cincy Bungles 20-10.

Before da’ game, while I was
tailgating with my double kiel—
bossie and kraut sammich (fol-
lowed up with some of them
sautayed pie-rogies, then warshed
dahn with a healthy dose of Am
City), I was a little worried. I was
thinking as I was speakin’ aht loud
that the Black ‘n’ Gold might be in
for a lit’le letdahn after their dis-
mantling of the K.C. Chiefs.

But what I saw as I stumbled up
to my sixth-level nosebleeders did
not disappoint. I repeat, did not dis-
appoint. The Stillers played like
they were playin’ back dahn around
the ‘70s when they won da Super
Bowl four times. They were
unstoppable n’at. I repeat, unstop-
pable n’at.

I fortuitiously thought I saw da’
Still Curtain right before my very
eyes. But instead of tooﬂess Jack
Lambert sackin’ the quarterback, it
was snake-playin’ Chad Brahn
recording four-point-five sacks.
And Lee-von Kirkland reminded
me of a young Mean Joe Green,
before he made that fancy lit’le
Coke TV thing; he was literally all
over da ball. It was almost like he
spent more time in da back-filled
than that Blake character for the
Bungles. Blake got sacked so much
that I was tempted to throw dahn
some extra Ty-lee-nols for his
aching skull. (Probably all he need-
ed was an I.C. Light, that sissy.)
And that Rod Woodson has obvi-
ously been doin’ more than just bar-
tendin’ and servin’ fatty grilled bur-
gahs as he scooped up a loose ball

Mens’ soccer can’! seem to  
find the correct combination

Brien Kn°¥i_sh..

   

The men’s soccer team fell victim
to another shutout on Sunday at the
hands —— actually at the feet —— of
19th-ranked Notre Dame.

“Our guys played hard: they just
didn’t play good soccer,” Head Coach
Joe Luxbacher said of Pitt’s 3-0 loss
in South Bend, Ind.

The Panthers are currently
plagued with several injuries, but
Luxbacher refused to use that as an
excuse for the loss, Pitt’s third
straight setback.

“To be honest with you, we’re
just struggling right now,” he said.
“We are injured, but this is a team
game.” '

While it was a disappointing loss,
there is no shame in losing to Notre
Dame, especially at home.

Sunday’s victory was the Irish’s
third straight shutout. In fact, the
Fighting Irish have blanked eight.
opponents this year and have surren-
dered only three goals at home. Pitt
has been shutout four times this sea-
son.
One goal each by Joe Gailo, Tony
Capasso and Ryan Turner, coupled
with stellar play from goalie Greg

Volno, brought the Fighting Irish to
victory. Capasso leads the Irish with
six goals, including four game-win-
ners and six assists (18 points).
Through 13 games, Volno has 0.66
goals against average. Against confer-
ence opponents, he’s even tougher -
0.31 GAA.

All three Irish goals were fired
less than nine yards from Panther
goalie Adam Spitzer, and the Irish
also outshot the Panthers 10-6.

Notre Dame’s win was a revenge
of sorts. Last season, Pitt blanked the
Irish 3-0 at Pitt Stadium en route to a
second-place finish in the conference
regular season and tournament stand-
ings.

This loss drops the Panthers’
record to 3-7-1, including a dismal 0-
7-1 conference mark. The victory
advanced Notre Dame to a 9-2-2
record and propelled them into sole
possession of first place in the Big
East with a conference record of 5-0-
2. However, conference foes St.
John’s and Rutgers are both ranked
higher in the national polls.

Pitt is far from national poll con-
sideration.

“We’re searching for solutions
but just not ﬁnding them,” Luxbacher
said.

 

Mens’ n’t find a way to win.

Pitt is on the road this weekend
and hopes to earn its first conference
wins of the season against Villanova
and the fourth—ranked Scarlet Knights
of Rutgers on Sunday.

X-country falls short at the Paul Short
Men come in 19th of 30, women finish 25th out of 29

   

After a two-week break, not
much changed for the Pitt men’s
and women’s cross country teams
last weekend. The teams travelled
to Lehigh University to compete in
the Paul Short Invitational meet on
Saturday.

The men finished in a tie with
Mount St. Mary’s for 19th place in
the field of 30 teams, with 504
points. Villanova won the meet with
47. The individual winner, with a
time of 24:43.6, was Che
Arosemena of Penn State.

Ed Adamson was Pitt’s top man,
coming in 13th place with a time of
25: 14.9 for the 8000-meter course.

“I have to give him a lot of
credit,” said Pitt Coach Dave Sobal.
“He was buried in 40th or 50th
place about 1000 meters into the
race. Even with 300 meters to go,
he was still in 18th or 20th. As the
competition gets tougher, it’s harder
to come back like that.”

The revolving door that is Pitt’s
second spot this season was taken
by Scott Curry. Curry turned in his
best time of the season, 26:07.1. In
four races this year, Curry is the
fourth differentperson to finish sec-
ond for Pitt.

“Scott’s had some great work-
outs. We’ve been waiting for that
from him,” Sobal said.

Pitt’s third man was Matt
Samuel, who finished in 26:24.2.
Like Adamson and Curry, Samuel’s
performance took a bite out of his
previous best time this season.
Unlike them, Samuel did it with a
blistering start —— a 4:58 first mile
— and dropped off.

The Pitt women finished 25th of
29 teams, scoring 602 points. Penn
State won the meet with 51. The
individual winner was
Georgetown’s Janelle Thomas, who
ran the 5000—meter race in 17:29.0.

Pitt was led by Stephanie
Ellsworth, who finished in 52nd
place with a time of 18:57.3. She

was only three seconds off her best

xiv-'9». ~'v:9o~vtt1i’3v:

time this season, but was a victim of
the huge field at the meet.

“She’s not fast enough to get out
front. She’d have to nearly PR in
the first mile to get out where she
needs to be,” Sobal said. “In the
middle of the pack, it’s difficult,
with people bumping you around
the turns.”

The big pleasant surprise for the
women came from Stacey
Anderson. After a string of sub-par
races, Anderson showed signs of the
runner she was last season. She ran
her fastest race of the season by far,
finishing in 19:19.9. Lynda Andros
also had a season-best performance,
running a 19:50.6.

Next Saturday, both teams race
at the Duquesne Invitational in
Schenley Park. Technically,
Duquesne will be the “home” team,
but it will also be on home turf for
the Panthers. The women will run
first, starting at 11:15 a.m., fol-
lowed by the men. Both races will
start and finish near the Schenley
Oval track.

All you ever really needed to know about footbagging

On a nice sunny day take yester-
day for example — they’ll be huddled
in small and large circles in front of the
Towers kicking around a small, soft,
spherical object, attempting to keep it
from falling to the ground.

They’re not soliciting for change or
asking for Homecoming votes; these
people are participating in one of North
America’s more rapidly growing recre-
ational sports -— freestyle footbagging.

Footbagging, a.k.a. hacky sacking,
originated in Oregon in 1972 and was
created by two men with little else to do
— John Stalberger and Mike Marshall.
The game is a modern version of an
ancient sport played in Asia and North
America.

Today, hacky sacking consumes a
college student’s free—time in Canada
and the United States and continues to
rise in popularity: over three million
footbags were sold last year. It’s not just
for potheads or soccer players; footbag-
ging can be enjoyed by anyone. All it
takes is some energy.

“We’ve been kickin’ hack since
high school,” said former Pitt student
Brian Lizambri, an avid hacker. “A cou-
ple of us entered competitions. But it’s
real hard getting anything organized in
this part of the country.”

Footbagging is a serious sport in
the western United States. An
International Footbag Advisory Board
really exists and they really do set rules
and organize tournaments. Hundreds of
hacky sack clubs are out west, but the
closest ofﬁcial one to Pittsburgh is at
the University of Florida.

So what do those of us that wish to
hack do? Well, we go outside and hack,
while the weather still permits, until we
have to go inside, move furniture
around and avoid the ceiling.

For any of you wishing to hack, it’s
easy to get involved.

“Man, we always let people in the
circle,” said hacker Pete Borgman, who
frequents hack circles more often than
class. “It doesn’t matter how good you
are, it’s like anything else, man; it takes
time to get good at.”

Borgman says he’s been hackin’ for
years, and it’s just a way to release
some energy and avoid sitting around
all day eating or smoking after a rough
day of classes.

For those that find hacky sack as
nothing but an annoyance, here’s a
quick rundown of some footbagging
terminologies, so a correlation can be
made between hack and non—hack
lingo.

Hack — When everyone in the
hack circle touches the hack at least
once, without the hack hitting the
ground or being touched by hands.
There can be double, triple, quadruple,

 

infinite hacks in a turn.

Circle — Where the hackers hack.
A circle can be formed anywhere: side-
walks, roads, rooftops, or in front of the
Towers.

Stall — A momentary pause of the
hack, but the
hack is still T H E
going. There are
toe stalls, inside
stalls, knee
stalls and back stall, just to name a few.

There are jesters, cloud kicks, sole
kicks, chest stalls, and basically, what-
ever you can do to keep the hack from
hitting the ground is perfectly legal.

Some things are illegal. Believe it
or not, there are several rules to be a

successful footbagger. The first and
utmost rule: never touch the back with
your hands.

“Yeah, that’s the toughest one to
remember when you first start,” said
Lenny Myers. “But if you touch it, you
get beaned.”

Myers is
referring to get-
ting the sack
thrown at a
body part, frequently the genitals.

“After that happens a couple
times,” Myers said, ‘.‘you’ll remember
not to catch it.”

Plus, never say “I’m sorry” after
messing up a hack rotation. Myers says
that rule is violated the most, but it’s not

ly work better than more form—ﬁtting
tops. It’s all about being comfortable.
“You just have to be loose, no wor-
ries,” Borgman said. “If you’re not
loose and worried about keeping the
hack going, you’ll suck. It’s a reaction
thing. You know, like feelin’ the ﬂow.”
Shoes can pose the biggest problem
for the fashionable hacker. This writer
ﬁnds a comfy pair of sandals to work
the best, but most people would agree
that the Adidas Rod Laver nylon-mesh
tennis shoe or a fresh set of Pumas
work the best. The one key to footbag-
ging shoes: they must be broken in.
Speaking of things being broken in,
a good hack is always worn down. The
softer, the better — it’s easier to stall. In

are the most common and can be found
anywhere. The number—one manufac-
turer of crocheted footbags is Sipa Sipa,
although many find those sacks take
too long to break in. Stitched footbags
are sewn together in panels and are
more expensive than crocheted foot-
bags.

The inside of a sack is filled with
beads or sand. Usually, the bigger the
bead, the less chance there is of them
falling out. A leaky hack sucks.

Naturally, the only way to experi-
