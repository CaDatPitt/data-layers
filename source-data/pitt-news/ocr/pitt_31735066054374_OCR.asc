Ofﬁcials insist campus
safety will not be affected by
contract negotiations, but some
Pitt Police say that morale has
taken a beating — a result of

" working without a contract.

“I hope that everybody’s
working to their fullest ability,”
said one ofﬁcer who asked not
to be identiﬁed. “We’re still
doing our job. But some hesi-
tate to go that extra step. The
contract is aitender issue.”

Pitt spokesman Ken
Service was quick to reply,
“No. [Campus safety is not in
jeopardy], not at all. The [carn-
pus police] have had a very pro-

F fessional manner in their duties
during the ongoing negotia-
tions. There has been no reduc-
tion in terms of safety.”

Pitt Police shied away from

 

 

giving their names for fear of
losing their jobs, but a few ven-
tured to comment on the issue.

“We do everything a city of
Pittsburgh ofﬁcer does,” said
another ofﬁcer. “But our
salaries top oﬁ at almost half
theirs.”

The last raise campus
police received was in July
1993, and it expired a year later.
As of July 1, 1994, no new con-
tracts were made.

After two years of working
without a contract, the campus
police are negotiating for high-
er pay and better beneﬁts, at
least to “keep our heads above
water,” according to Albert
Fink, the president of the
University of Pittsburgh Police
Association.

P Sister of slain celebrity
 speaks out about abuse

Rachel B h Ier

She was the ﬁrst to say that
Nicole Brown-Simpson was
not a battered woman.

That was before she read
her private notes and her inti-
mate diary, before she visited
numerous shelters and read
books about abuse.

Now Denise Brown,
Nicole’s sister, is traveling
around the country to speak
against domestic violence. She
will be stopping at Pitt this
evening to help celebrate the
nationwide Week Without
Violence.

Brown said that college
students can be vulnerable to
domestic violence, because
they’re on their own for the first

time and possibly forming rela-
tionships that could become
more serious and permanent.
According to Barbara
Weiner of the Pittsburgh Action '

- Against Rape, one organization

involved with tonight’s rally,
domestic abuse begins with
feelings of being isolated or
controlled by someone.

Brown said that domestic
violence awareness needs to
begin at a young age, and she is
currently involved with several
organizations which promote

' awareness. Brown’s program

Ask any collegiate
student athlete how
they feel about receiv-
ing an athletic scholar-
ship, and most will teH
you that it is a great
honor and a source of
pride.

Many student ath-
letes worked hard in
high school in the hopes
of receiving a scholar-
ship and making their
dream become a reality.

Just ask Jen Nickels, a fresh-
man full—scholarship recipient for
volleyball. “I have always had’

obtaining a scholarship as a goal.

I wanted to achieve,” she said. “It

is a way to prove to myself that I

can reach a goal I have set.”
Last year, 330 athletic schol-

_arships were awarded to under-

graduate Pitt students, and $3.1
million of University ﬁmds, pri-
vate endowments, and alumni
giving were used to ﬁnance the
scholarships.

According to Oval Jaynes,
Pitt’s athletic director, the
University has just had two of the
best years in athletic alumni
donations, making it possible to
award more athletic scholarships
to more student athletes.

The increase has been espe-
cially useful in giving more
money to those sports that tradi-
tionally don’t have a deep budget
and in increasing the amount of
awards given to women athletes.

The Class A athletic scholar-
ships give students’ full tuition,
room and board, and an

allowance for books. NCAA
rules  this amount as all that
colleges and universities can
offer their athletes. Anything
offered outside of this perimeter
is instantly considered illegal and
subject to stiff penalties by the
NCAA.

The athletic department
divides itself in two sections:
head count sports and equivalen-
cy sports. When dealing with
head count sports, only full
scholarships are awarded and are
based on a speciﬁed number the
NCAA allows in relation to the
number of players on that team.

These sports include football,‘

which is allocated 85 full scholar-
ships; men’s basketball, which is
given 13 full scholarships;
women’s basketball, which is
allowed 15 full scholarships;
women’s gyrrmastics, which ties

 

women’s volleyball
with 12 full scholar-
ships; and men’s and
women’s tennis,
which come in with 8
full scholarships.
Equivalency
sports are those in
which a sum of money
is allocated to the team
for scholarship pur-
poses. The coaching
staff, in conjunction
with the athletic
department, decides
how that money can
best be usedinthe form ofacom-
bination of full and partial schol-
arships. Swimming, wrestling,
men’s and women’s soccer, and
track and ﬁeld are examples of
equivalency sports. ’
Once the money is distrib-
uted to the various sports, the

-coaching staff of those sports

work with their scholarship bud-
get in an effort to determine how
to best utilize the money to
strengthen their programs. They
then go to the athletic department
with their recommendations on
how the money should be spent,
and the department composes
one large recommendation for
the sport. and sends it to the
Office of Admissions and
Financial Aid. '

As Donna Sanft, the associ-
ate athletic director, remarked,
the athletic department only
advises who should receive the
athletic scholarships while the
Ofﬁce of Admissions and
Financial Aid is the actual depart-
ment that awards the students the
scholarship aid.

season tears up east coast

LONDON —,At least 31 people

were injured inside the British
Army ’s headquarters at Lisburn
Monday when two car bombs

exploded. These bombings, the first
in two years against the military in
Northern Ireland, are believed to be
the work of anti-British terrorists,
although no group has claimed
responsibility yet. These bombings
add to the damage already inﬂicted
on the Northern Ireland peace
process.

According to the British Army
and police, the first explosion was a
500-pound car bomb that exploded at
the British Army headquarters. The
second car bomb was smaller, but
exploded at the medical center where
the victims, of _the first bomb were
taken for medical treatment. The

CROSS CITY, Fla. — Tropical
Storm Josephine wreaked havoc all
along the west coast of Florida on
Monday. The storm caused more than
a dozen tornadoes to sweep across
Florida and swallowed up many
coastal roads.

According to forecasters at the
National Hurricane Center, Georgia,
South Carolina, and much of the
eastern U.S. felt the effects yesterday
and may continue to do so into today.
The storm caused mass flooding

throughout Florida and power out-

ages in several areas. Fortunately, the
eye of the storm hit a sparsely—popu-
lated area between Apalachicola and
Cross City, Florida, not causing a
great amount of home loss. Reuters

WASHINGTON —— The Presidential
debate last Sunday didn’t attract the
number of viewers that both sides
had expected. Overnight estimates

suggested that as much as 20 percent

fewer people watched the debate on
Sunday than four years ago. The"
early polls also show that the debate
shifted few voters. §

WASHINGTON — The Food and

Drug Administration approved

Monday equipment that would allow 1
doctors to perform some heart surg—;
cries without cracking open the?
patient’s chest.

The new procedure allows doc-
tors to thread catheters through an
artery in the groin and stop patient’s
hearts while they are put on a heart
and lung machine. The doctors then
operate through small incisions
instead of having to saw through the
breast plate as they had to in the past.

Like a mirror, the Pitt campus presents
two parallel images, two parallel worlds
going on simultaneously, yet totally oppo-
site.

The ﬁrst image is of the student, who
represents the future growth of the country,
upper-level learning, and advancement.

The second is of the homeless person,
representing the epitome of hopelessness
and stagnation, stuck in a downward spiral,
with little or no chance of success.

Many believe that these panhandlers
put themselves in that position, but there
are also a number of them who have severe
physical and mental disabilities and are
unable to help their condition on their own.
The cost of living has risen too high for
them to support themselves, so they have
no option but the streets. _

Yesterday’s paper showed a parrhan-
dler named Tim with a caption that read:
“Students have been giving money to Tim
for years. Is he any better 0 .” Tim
responded to the caption, “Damn right I’m
better off. I ain’t in jail, am 1? HI didn’t get
no money, I’d be in jail by now.”

According to a report from Western
Psychiatric‘ Institute, the majority of
Oakland’s panhandlers are suffering not
only from a mental illness but also are
addicted to some kind of substance, most
commonly alcohol and crack—cocaine.

Thirty-ﬁve-year-old Daryl White says
he’s been panhandling all of his life and
denies that every homeless person is look-
ing to buy drugs.

“It’s not always about drugs or wine,”
he said. “I tell people I’m hungry, and
sometimes they take me to McDonald’s or

   
    
 
 

Subway to get something to eat.”

Daryl has been on the streets of
Oakland for the past two or three years. He
lost his home when he was incarcerated in
the county jail.

“Are we con—artists?” he said. “Sure
we are, but we do what we got to do to sur-
vive, to stay out of jail. Jail’s like a roach
motel: you check in, but you don’t check
out.”

When asked why he doesn’t work full-
time, Daryl responded, “I’m an alcoholic. I
can’t hold a job. Every time I got my pay-
check, I’d go get drunk But I don’t do no
drugs. I come down here every day at about
9:30, 10 o’clock and stay until about six. I
end up with about 60 or 70 dollars a day.”

However, most homeless people have
severe mental disabilities, the most com-
mon being schizophrenia. Schizophrenia
usually begins effecting persons in their
early to mid-20s and can totally destroy
someone’s everyday normal life.

Schizophrenics may experience delu-
sions, and their perception may be distort-
ed to a point that they can’t hold a job or
even get a place to live. They sometimes
hear voices and are extremely paranoid.
Personal hygiene may be completely lost,
as they go for weeks without changing
clothes or bathing. '

One 30-year-old man, who spoke only
if hisname would not be printed, came to
Pitt to go to school but dropped out for
financial reasons. “I came to Pitt to suc-
ceed, but I have failed,” he said.

This man has a place to sleep and
doesn’t use the traditional method of hold-
ing a cup. Instead, he wanders Oakland day
and night asking people to spare him some
change. He appears normal at times, yet
other times he shows symptom of schizo-

phrenia.

He collects government assistance for
mentally ill citizens, and donates plasma
for a mere $15 per session. Smoking used
cigarettes, drinking other people’s aban-
doned cups of beer in local bars, and eating
food from garbage bins are some of his
habits.

Major depression and bi-polar disor-
ders are also common illnesses of the
homeless. Severe mood-swings are the pri-
mary symptoms of this disease. A person
may be extremely happy one minute and
the next hate themselves so badly that they
want to die.

Alcoholism or drug abuse also leads to
many homeless lifestyles. Alcoholism and
drug addiction are diseases that are nearly
impossible to cure without professional
help. The victim’s level of ﬁrnctioning
decreases rapidly to a point where they hit
“rock bottom,” ﬁnding themselves home-
less, jobless, and often friendless.

When a person hits “rock bottom”
there are only three directions to go. They
can seek help and get better, be institution-
alized (hospital or jail), or end up dead.

Western Psych -normally has the same
returning patients year after year. As soon
as the weather starts to get cold they
receive an inﬂux of homeless patients.

Many panhandlers could receive wel-
fare to help them out but are afraid to go to
the government. Some have such low self-
esteem that they would rather be on the
streets than be discovered. _

Daryl said that the Oakland panhan-
dlers get a bad rap. “I ain’t robbing nobody,
snatching nobody’s purse,” he said. “I’m
just trying to get dinner. Sure we deal with
a lot of rejection, but I just smile and be
happy. Ask and you will receive.”-

 

refrigerator at home to serve as a
reminder that violence is neither an
answer nor an optionto problems.

As children grow up, Brown said
they need to learn that violence is a cycle
and that respect and communication
should be developed early in a relation-
ship to avoid abusive relationships.

Brown is the founder of the Nicole
Brown Simpson Foundation which raises
money for charities and shelters. She is
also the Chair of the Women’s Progress
Alliance, which focuses on making polit-
ical changes regarding domestic violence
and abuse laws. I

The statistics by the American
Medical Association for 1995, show that
two to four million women are battered
every year, and as many as 1,500 a year
are killed by an intimate partner.

This year at Pitt, ﬁve cases of domes-
tic abuse have been reported. Pitt Police
Deputy Gary Moses said this ﬁgure is
projected to double by the end of year.

Moses said most “domestic” cases

reported probably only represent a small
fraction of what actually occurs on carn-
pus. He said the police is probably a last
resort for students suffering from domes-
tic abuse.

Brown said that she sees three things
in many domestic violence cases: the
hope that things will get better, the shame
in telling anyone the truth, and the fear of
the unknown.

She said her goal is to get across the
message that respect must exist in a rela-
tionship, and that if this is not present, you
need to stand up_for yourself.

Abusive men often begin as charm-
ing, Brown said, but quickly change.

"‘Look for signs of them being con-
trolling -— ‘I’l1 do it for you,’ or ‘Don’t
answer the phone,’ ‘I don’t want you to
get hurt’ or ‘Don’t leave, I don’t want
anyone to hurt you.’  It’s O.K to be
macho, it’s just not O.K tohit,” Brown
said.

She said men may feel threatened by

her messages, and she has been labeled as .

 

a feminist and an activist, two titles that
she does not desire to have.

“I am not a male basher. I don’t want
to bash men. I want -men to join us,” she
said.

Tonight’s rally will involve three
campus organizations: the Campus
Woman’s Organization, the Women’s

_ Studies Program, and the Sexual Assault

Counseling Services Organization.
Pittsburgh’s Young Women’s Christian
Association is organizing and sponsoring
the event.

Brown will begin speaking at 7 p.m.
in the William Pitt Union‘ Assembly
Room. The band Ras Prophet will also be
performing reggae at the event.

Admission is free to students and to
the public.

No scripts, no directors, no producers

Improv-a-tlron is 24 hour spontaneous imagination celebration

Marc Nuzzo

 

Who the hell wants to see theater on a
Friday night when there are so many better
things to do? _

Don’t wony if that’s what you think.
Louis Stein, the coordinator for the upcom-
ing 1996 Irnprov—A—Thon used to feel the
same way.

“The ﬁrst time, I was real reluctant to
go to 'improvs,” Stein said. “Now, Betty
Ford and a monster truck couldn’t drag me
away from irnprov. It’s that much frm.”

The annual Improv—A—Thon, a 24-hour
comedy improvisation show, is now in its
third year and will be held this Friday at 11
p.m. through Saturday at 11 p.m. in the Pitt
Theater. The event will consist of perfor-
mances by comedy improvisation groups,
bands, and, of course, the audience itself.

The Irnprov—A-Thon is the outgrowth
of Friday Night Irnprovs, a weekly comedy
show made up entirely of audience partici-
pation.

“Improv has steadily grown over the
past ﬁve years,” said Stein. “The marathon-
charity event simply emerged as an idea.”

Now in its seventh year, Stein said .

Friday Night Improvs began as a workshop
for improvisational skills of students in the-
ater classes. .

“It grew into a weekly show and
became very popular,” said Stein. FNI is so

popular in fact that all nine performances so

far this year have been completely sold out.

“It’s a lot of fun. You just relax and

I have a good time. You have to get there

early, though, because it sells out really
quickly,” said Pitt student Eric
Frankenﬁeld.

The Improv-A-Thon has drawn an
international troupe of comedy acts and
bands to perform each year, and this one is
no different; Some of the acts and bands
scheduled to perform include bands like
Robespierre and The Distractions, to come-
dy performers like Pet Co., The Buttered
Niblets, Rein of Terror, and Jeremy Rosen
from Toronto’s “Theater on the Edge.”

“[During the 24 hours] groups will per-
form in 45 minutes to one-hour sets, and
every two hours we’ll intersperse audience
participation,” Stein said.

Tickets for this event cost $6 in
advance and $8 at the door. People in atten-
dance will get a hand stamp enabling them
to come and go as they please during the
24-hour show.

“Every penny we raise goes to the
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force,” said Stein.
“They need so much money to help with
[their costs] that it just seemed like a really
good choice.”

The fund raising will not be limited to
the proﬁts of the tickets, however. A “date
auction” and ratﬂes for various prizes will
occur during the the event

Wednesday, October 9, 1996

“Last year someone went at the date
auction for over $300.00  It’s a great way
to raise even more money for the AIDS
Task Force,” said Stein.

The Irnprov—A-Thon has also received
several hundred dollars in donations to
make this year’s event a success.

Stein said that there would be free food
and drink Bagels from Bruegger’s Bagels,
cases of Josta cola from PepsiCo, and
prizes from Phantom of the Attic, CD
Trader, and Macando were donated to the
event.

“I have to keep an entire crowd of peo-
ple up for 24 hours. I love the Josta!” said
Stein.

Anyone who can stay up late is wel-
comed to the event, and Stein said it’s a
welcome alternative to most Friday night
activities.

“It’s all ages. It’s non-alcoholic, and

while thatsounds weird, it’s a great drink-
ing alternative: if you’re under 21 you can’t
get into bars, and if you’re over 21, well,
you’re just sick of bars,” he said. “It’s ﬁinny
as all hell, and you won’t believe it until you
see it.” .
People interested in tickets for the 1996
Improv-A-Thon are encouraged to check
out the website at
(http://www.pitt.edu/~aja) or by calling
661-5325 in advance. Tickets will also be
available at the door during the perfor-
mance.

International journalist attacks media responsibility

Lisa Infield

39. 6
fvw‘-.-‘--. . .(.4'... . :..

   

A noted reporter and author energeti-
cally slashed through the pages of yellow
journalism in his speech at the Frick Art
Auditorium Monday.

“Journalism is too damned important

_ to be left to journalists,” according ‘to

Martin Walker, the international joumal-
ist.

“We ought to be held accountable.
You as our leaders, as our customers, as
our masters have got to demand more
from us. And hold us to higher stan-
dards.” ‘

Walker spoke at the School of
Information Science’s 18th Dean’s
Forum on the Ethics of Information. His
speech, “Give us Back our Good Names:
Ethics, Media, and Character,” addressed
the role of the media in modern society,
its conduct, and its responsibilities.

“You are listening to an oxymoron: a
journalist trying to speak about ethics,”
Walker told the crowded auditorium.
“You are looking at the pond scmn of
professional life.”

At case on stage and with the audi- ‘

ence, Walker hardly resembled “pond
scum,” though he is no doubt a journalist

 

as the U.S Bureau Chief of the British
newspaper The Guardian.

One of Walker’s main concerns is-
that the media and government are

becoming increasingly involved with one
another. 0

“I think it is a good tradition that the
media should not be, not necessarily
antagonistic to government, but should
have a healthy sense of skepticism,” he
said. “We’re becoming part of a perma-
nent government. There is an astonishing
number of people who move in and out of
journalism and government as though
they’re interchangeable professions.”

Walker gave several examples,
including the program Crossﬁre, of an
“incestuous crossing back and forth of
whatever lines there may be between
journalism and the media” until they “are
not just blurred, they’re crisscrossed.”

Walker’s speech also focused" on
media’s intrusion into the lives of public
ﬁgures and public officials. “What is use-

ful information?” he asked. “Is it useful to '

know whether Nancy Reagan had sex
with Frank Sinatra?”

Walker said the media should realize
the potential of their power, while also
assuming credit for their actions. ,

“The media can destroy people,” he

said. “One argues that some people
deserve it. I’m not sure anybody deserves
it.  I would like [reporters] to stop and
think a bit more, to be prepared and take
responsibility.”

Walker was concerned that the mod-
em media’s character standards were not
based on actual character traits but on
aspects such as “if [the official] can keep
his genitalia in his pants.”

Focusing the priorities of journalism
is something Walker said the media needs
to work on in general.

“What are our standards [to judge
people on]? Any test that is past by
Richard Nixon and not Franklin
Roosevelt is a pretty wretched test,” he
said. ‘

SIS student Julie Snyder wondered,
not only about standards, but about cred-
ibility. “My big problem is, how do you
tell whose statistics are right? How do I
know if what [Walker is] saying is right
or what everybody else is saying is
right?” she said. “How do I know if what
he’s saying is wrong is actually wrong?”

The curse of the business may be that
journalism is too important to trust with
anybody, but, according to Walker, soon-
er or later you have to take somebody’s
word for it.

Pitt Police are currently cov-
ered by Act 195 — the Public
Employees Act — which allows
employees to strike, but they
want to be covered by Act 111
— the Municipal Police Officers
Act — according to Brian
Campbell, the attorney for the
University of Pittsburgh Police
Association.

Act 111 does not allow
police ofﬁcers to strike but pro-
vides an arbitrator to interject, in
the event of a stalemate between
the two parties. The arbitrator’s
decision is binding and ﬁnal.

While most employees pre-
fer the option of striking if
demands aren’t met, the Pitt
Police see a different beneﬁt _to
Act 111.

“For public safety employ-
ees, Act 111 is much better
because the nature of the people
who take this job feel obligated
to serve the people and not
strike,” said Fink.

‘ Despite the option of strik-
ing if there are no resolutions to
the talks, Fink said the unionized
ofﬁcers will likely not strike.

“We don’t think it is appro-
priate. We are charged, with the
safety of the campus and its vis-

‘TIME

itors, and we choose not to
stiike,” said Fink.

Pitt Police wages begin
around $10 per hour and top off
at about $13.50 per hour, accord—
ing to Fink. The $13.50 per hour
amounts to $30,240 a year, for a
40-hour week. Police ofﬁcers
are paid time and a half for over-
time.

A city of Pittsburgh police
officer said that their salaries
start at $27,800 and top olf at
$39,700. The starting salary
depends on each officer’s train-
ing.

One Pitt officer said that the
University needs to consider the
value of Pitt Police response
time before determining their
monetary value to Pitt. .

“This past weekend, a PAT
bus called and said there was a
man in the back with a gun. My
partner and I got there in less
than five seconds. The city
police got there afterwards, but a
lot can happen in ﬁve seconds,”
said the ofﬁcer. ’

Earlier this year, Pitt appro-
priated $175,000 to the Pitt
Police Department for campus
safety.‘ One officer questioned
exactly how the sum would be
broken down.

Almost all of the Pitt Police

ing to Fink.

well. There are presently 54

one ofﬁcer. “We just want to

Scholarships  

As soon as the coaching
staffs together with the athletic
department and the Office of
Admissions and Financial Aid
award a full or partial scholar-
ship, that scholarship remains
valid for th_e entire year, even if
the recipient decides to quit the
team or is not able to participate.

‘The NCAA does not allow
us to increase or decrease aid dur-
ing the course of the year,” said
Jaynes. This, in effect, means that
Pitt cannot give money one athlete
relinquished to another athlete.
Therefore, the money returns to
the athletic budget.

Karen Altomari of the Office
of Admissions and Financial Aid
said, “An athletic scholarship is a
series of one year renewable

1 awards. It is not a four year

award.”
Athletes are contacted by July
1 to notify them of whether or not

their ‘scholarship has been

renewed. “The renewability of the
award is based on meeting
NCAA standards of eligibility,”
said Sanft. ’

As a result, student athletes
can be denied a continuation of
their athletic—based aid if they
fail to meet the required 2.0 GPA

drug tests, or if the coach has
made a decision to eliminate aid
based on the character and per-
formance of the student athlete.
Athletes can take action if they
feel they still deserve scholarship
aid by requesting a hearing
directed by the Office of the
Provost. .
Pitt will not, however, take
away athletic scholarships if the
athlete becomes injured while
participating in his or her sport.
“Student athletes who
receive an injury due to their par-

ticipation in a particular sport

don’t lose their scholarship
because of that injury,” said
Jaynes. “The reason behind this
is the assumption that the athlete
didn’t plan on being injured‘.
This is so student athletes can
receive their degrees.”

Pitt has a number of medical
student athletes ranging from
women gymnasts to track and

_ ﬁeld athletes. It is Pitt’s policy to

allow student athletes who have
become injured to retain their‘
scholarships, not NCAA rulings.
“Athletic scholarships can-
not be reduced during the year
based on injury. That is to protect
the student athlete. If they get-
hurt nobody can take their schol-
arship away,” Altomari said.

If you’ve ever baby—sat someone, then
you know how diﬂicult it is to keep an eye
on one child.

Imagine over 1,200 of them.

A Pitt researcher joined forces with a
Penn State professor in one of the most
comprehensive child care studies in the
United States. It studied nearly 1,200 fam-
ilies, 120 of which come from Pittsburgh.

Sponsored by the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development,
one of the major developments of the
study is, contrary to what might be expect-
ed: child care outside the home does not
cause a child to lose trust in their mothers.

Even though the researchers have
only completed the data for infants, they
have been following the children since
birth for eight years. It is an ongoing study
with funding through the year 2000.
VV1thin the year, researchers will have
completed the data on toddlers and
preschoolers.

Pitt/Penn State is a joint site with Dr.
Susan Campbell and Dr. Celia Brownell
researching out of Pitt and Jay Belsky out
of Penn State.

“Given all we know about the impor-
tance of family in the child’s development,
how does child care affect that?” said
Campbell. ‘”Ihere’s a lot of controversy
politically whether child care has good

ofessor studes effec

 

effects or bad elfects on the child.”

The study looks at the kind of family
environment that the infant is being raised
in and the quality of child care they
receive. The researchers study whether it
matters how early the child goes into care,
how many hours a week, and how the
quality of the care affects the infant.

If the child is being watched by any-
body other than the mother — the father,
grandmother, babysitter — it is considered
to be in child care. The researchers observe
the children in different settings several
times a year, such as play rooms at the
University, the child’s home, and a family
day care home.

There is wide ethnic diversity among
the 1,200 families, as well as an economic
status that ranges from welfare to people
living comfortably. The study uses chil-
dren from single parent families as well as
two—parent families. The study uses babies
that were full-term healthy babies and an
equal number in gender. '

“This study is trying to get a broader
study from educational and cultural back-
grounds than previous ones,” said
Campbell.

The study has found that the econom-
ic status of the family is a major factor in
who uses outside child care.

The question the researchers have is if
an infant spends 10 hours or more a week
away from the mother, will it affect the
child—mother relationship? '

So far, the researchers found there was
no effect in the quality of the relationship
between the infant and the mother, unless
the researchers compared the two environ-
ments. They found if one was of a lower
quality than the other there was indeed a
diﬁerence.

“If the mother was insensitive and the
child care was of lower quality it made a
diﬂerence,” said Campbell. “The combi-
nation of those two "factors lead to a less
secure relationship.”

The surprising result of the study was
that as long as one of the relationships was
of a high quality, then the child is general-
ly secure and has more trust in adults. They
expected the infant to be more dependent
on the mother for a secure relationship.

“As long as they’re getting some
responsive, sensitive care then they get the
security in the adults they need,” said
Campbell.

This study will help the researchers

have a sense of how both family and child ‘

care affects a child’s cognitive develop-
ment and school readiness.

When they’re ﬁnished, researchers
will also better understand more about the
processes of early development in chil-
dren, and how the family and child care
together leads to a child’s development.

Discovering the effects of child care
ultimately will lead to more adjusted chil-
dren, said Campbell, and well adjusted
children often lead to well adjusted adults.

gets to the
grass roots of
campaigning

Matt Sa uel

VVrth the current trend of shifting power
from Washington, D.C. to state and local
governments, jobs like state representative
have become more important. Coleen
Vuono wants to take that power all the way
back to the grass roots.

Vuono, who is running for state repre-
sentative in the 42nd Congressional District,
spoke to students -about the importance of
local campaigns - at the University
Democrats’ meeting on Wednesday night.

“Local campaigns are where the action
is; you get to talk to people one on one,” said
Vuono, whose daughter, Gina, attends Pitt
and is a member of the University
Democrats. .

She was ﬁrst elected to public oiﬁce _in
Mt. Lebanon, as a member of the Board of
Commissioners. She then went on to serve
as the Board’s president in 1990.

In 1992, she chose to leave public office
to care for her father, who was battling
leukemia

Last year, she ran for county cornrnis—
sioner along with Mike Dawida and lost by’
a slim margin to current Commissioners
Bob Cranmer and Larry Dunn. .

So when the 42nd District state repre-
sentative seat became vacant, Vuono was
the logical choice to run, and this time she
has come out of the blocks with a strong
campaign .

Vuono is in favor of the creation of new
jobs, and cutting taxes in the area.

“I know most students are wondering
where they are going to ﬁnd a job when they
are ﬁnished with school,” said Vuono. .

Vuono hopes to achieve this by cutting
business taxes, which she said she hopes
will stimulate the growth of existing compa-
nies and bring in high-paying jobs to the
region. I

“I can devote all my time to this jo ,”
stated Vuono, “[Stevenson] on the other
hand will split time between this and being a
lawyer.”

Stevenson’s record on local economic
issues was also attacked by Vuono.

“While on the Mt. Lebanon Board of
Commissioners, he didn’t vote on the bud-

tics is hard work in general, Vuono said she

Pitt Police deserve
top dollar respect

_ Are you aware of the fact that the Pitt Police has
been working for two years without ‘a contract? As the
guardians of our safety here on campus, the Pitt Police
should have the security and benefits of .a contract
before virtually anyone else.

The salaries of campus police officers top off at
about half of what Pittsburgh Police officers make.
Almost all campus police officers have graduated from
police academies, and some have college degrees. They
are also subject to mandatory police academy training
and must update their training every year. ’

These hard-working men and women have been
negotiating for higher wages and greater benefits. Given
the fact that they risk their life and limb for student safe-
ty in the course of their careers, this is not too much to
ask. Being that this University is an urban campus and
that crime here is prevalent, the University should be
willing to put up top dollar to show the appreciation we
all feel for the fact that there are police here looking out
for us.

We would also appreciate the Pitt Police for going
above and beyond the call of duty and not striking to get
what they want. If the Pitt Police were simply looking to
make more money and not truly concerned with our
safety, they would be on strike, and we would be left to
walk the streets of Oakland without police protection.
However, these dedicated individuals put their duty
above their own personal gain and have chosen to con-
tinue working without a contract while they are negoti-
ating.

We would like to wish the Pitt Police luck in their
negotiation-s. We hope they get everything they are ask-
ing for and thank them for putting the safety of the stu-
dents at this University first on their list of priorities.

Midterm madness: senior finally gets serious

 

 

I sort of fell into school. Actually,
I was pushed by my boss. “Girl, you
better get your head into some books
and out of my ﬁling system.”

So,Itookthisas ahintthatlwas
about to be ﬁred for , incompetence
and hurriedly applied for school. All
right, I exaggerate. But I did do a lot
of whining about how long it would
take me, part time and all. “I’ll be 40
before I’m done!” I whined. He ﬁxed
me with a steely eye. (He wasn’t the

V CEO just because he wore those

fancy bow ties, you understand.)
“Well, you can either be 40 with a
‘degree or 40 without one.” It was no
accident that this man was the boss.
And here he was, encouraging me! I
was not only ﬂattered ‘but also moved
by the simplicity and sense of his
argument I also really hated ﬁling ——
and it was mutual.

In the course of my studies, I
have found that this degree business is

now the least of my concems. You.

stay in school long enough, with an
advisor who helps you decode uni-
versity degree requirements, and you
will get a degree. (Q: Why is it that
every university ofﬁce requires a
small army of interpreters to explain
their functions? A: Because alﬂiough
the university sends out information
which appears to be written in
English, deciphering the actual mean-
ing is apparently beyond most degree
candidates.)

Many students ﬁnd that: their
original plans are derailed when they
are sidetracked by more interesting or
challenging ideas, or they ﬁnd out that
what they thought interested them
didn't, after all. For example, I
thought I was interested in medical

school for a while. Then my boss
pointed out that since I wore a surgi-
cal rubber glove before removing the
lid of his coffee cup to reﬁll it, that
maybe, just maybe, I was a bit on the
fastidious side for medicine. And cer-
tainly my lack of aptitude for ﬁling
did not bode well for a profession
built on careful methodology and
attention to detail. But I think this is
the whole point of a university. The
university experience should provide
an enviromnent conducive to discus-
sion. Discussion and exchange of

ideas is how one decides, to some

extent, one’s fate.

Nothing you learn is ever wast-
ed. It may seem like that if you
change schools or your major, but
none of us is so brilliant or well
infonned that taking another History
or English Lit. is going to hurt. Here
at this University, we have some great
professors who have much to share.
Sharing of lmowledge and ideas is
integral to this process. Don’t let ﬂiat
deafening silence in the classroom put
you off expressing your opinion. If
you don’t have an opinion, then say
why not.

Not speaking out and not con-
tributing to class discussions is rude. It
is saying something as surely as if you
opened your mouth. It is saying, “I do
not choose to participate. I’m keeping
my opinions to myself, and I refuse to
share.” Why bother going to class at
all? Sure, you can probably make it
through a university without opening
your mouth, but you will be a poorer
person for not opening yourself up to
the enrichment of verbalizing your
ideas and then tempering them with
the ideas of others. So what if nobody
agrees with you, or someone.doesn’t

I like your opinion? You are entitled to

your opinion. You are entitled to your

life. Stick up for yourself, and con-
tribute to your own education.
(Incidentally, most professors in
smaller elective classes do not expect
you to raise your hand before you
speak. Wait for an opening and dive
in.) Education is not about being
spoonfed formulas and ideas. It is
about an open forum of formulas and
ideas which may be modiﬁed into
your personal ethos.

Theanatomy of a degree is the
anatomy of a growing process: edu-
cation. You never know which class-
es and special interests you have that
just might be the key to the perfect job
one day. Nothing like distracting an
interviewer with an animated discus-
sion about those ﬁeld biology credits
in the sexual behavior of fruit ﬂies. It
is so convenient for establishing rap-
port with the interviewer, not to men-
tion that it provides a smoke screen
for the fact that you have no interest in

banking but. need the $25,000 per

year.

Of course, I am being facetious.
We all should be in a position not to
have to take a job we would hate just
for the greenbacks. That is one con-
crete reason for being here. Now, if
you have to take a job you are hoping
might mildly interest you while writ-
ing that screenplay for Aaron
Spelling, ﬁne: at least you have a plan.

I had a good friend who taught
me all about the importance of having
a plan. A goal to work towards, even
getting that midterm paper written,
gives structure to one’s life, and as we
all know one of the important tricks of
life is simply ﬁlling up the time. Plans
make you feel like you are at least ful-
ﬁlling this requirement.

’  ..,

Three weeks ago, I wrote a column
about several items I should be allowed to
hate. Our advisor told me that I had bitten
off more than I could chew and should con-
sider devoting an entire article to each part.
In that column, I wrote that “comparisons
between modem conservatives and fascist
regimes of the past couldn’t be more
untrue.” Since it seems that I can no longer
pick up this paper without reading the words
“fascist” or “Nazi,” I would like to take this
opportunity to explore why fascism is incor-
rectly being labeled as right-wing.

I have been reading a book called The
Road to Serfdom, by Friedrich Hayek This
book, written in 1944, explains the socialist
roots of fascism and the similarities between
communist Russia and Nazi Germany.
When I-Iitler’s economic system took hold
in Germany, the government directed the
economy and controlled the factors of pro-
duction. In Hayek’s book, Hitler is quoted
as saying, “Basically, National Socialism
and Marxism are the same.” While modern
conservatives believe in returning control to
the people, fascist regimes have always
emphasized a totalitarian government
which exerts full control over the entire
country. So why have communist govem-
ments always been labeled left—win , but
fascist governments have been seen as
right-wing?

    

.,-/1/_4 , ,
 2/’ -’
. If

One reason for ﬂiis misconception is
World War II. Because communist Russia
and Nazi Germany fought each other, histo-
rians want to analyze the war as being- a
clash between two different political
philosophies. Hayek wrote that economic
planning leads to totalitarian control, which
then gives rise to unscrupulous dictators.
The conﬂict between Germany and Russia
was not over political ideals, but rather a
power struggle between two brutal dictator-
ial regimes.

Unfortunately, the “fascism is right-
wing” myth is widely held by almost every-
one, and it is being taught here at Pitt In my
Eastern European political science class, the
professor has repeatedly used this line of
thinking. I took issue with his stance, and I
e—mailed him to help correct his views. He
wrote back claiming that he never meant to
_equate the term “fascism” with “right-
wing” or “conservative.” However, he has
still continued to teach this incorrect argu-
merit

Even more disturbing than the scholar-
ly look at this issue is the fact that idiots
often use terms like ‘ azi” and “fascist” to
insult our conservative leaders. When I was
at Clinton’s speech at Robert Morris, on
Sept 25, I encountered a number of social-
ist protesters. They were passing out litera-
ture which stated, “Impeach Governor
Ridge for Nazi crimes against humanity.”
This attack is also extended to people like
Pat Buchanan and Newt Gingrich. Don’t

berals, not conservatives

you think we’ve gone a little too far? I
mean, fascist governments were responsible
for the destruction of an entire continent, as
well as the murders of over six million peo-
ple. No matter how much liberals may hate
balanced budgets, protected borders, and
English as our oﬂicial language, there is no
way anyone should get away with calling
conservative leaders “Nazis” or “fascists.”
What makes these attacks even more
damaging is that the media has allowed
them to continue. If I were to call Bill
Clinton a communist, I would be laughed at
and dismissed as a lunatic. However, when
Pat Buchanan is called a “Nazi,” where is
the voice of reason? I agree that Buchanan’s
emphasis on nationalism has led to some
questionable policy ideas, but he has hardly
proposed eliminating an entire group of

people. I would like to point out that Clinton '

is much closer to being a communist than
Buchanan is to being a Nazi.‘

I wish I could olfer up a new insult for
liberals to use against hard—core right-
wingers like me, but I can’t seem to think of
any right now. Simply put, smaller govem-
ment, lower taxes, and sensible answers to
society’s ills should be beyond reproach.
However, the next time you wish to attack
conservatives, please don’t use the tenn
“fascist” or “Nazi.” You will only be expos-
ing your own ignorance of the truﬂr.

Matt Mills could have done a much better
job than Bob Dole in debating Bill Clinton

which try to teach men new ways to deal
with their anger. Yes, some men can learn
not be be victims of their anger.

But what about the victim that is actu-
ally in danger?

According to an article in Monday’s
Post-Gazette, studies show that 30 percent
of abusers, who register for help retum to
abusing their partners within 12 months.

Against those odds, what weeks like
this need to do is to tell women that it is
okay to get out of bad situations. It is okay
to leave their partners. It is okay to put their
own safety — and the safety of their chil-
dren and family members —— first

Also, women need to know that it’s the
right thing to do.

Most institutions and practices don’t
recognize that separation ﬁom this particu-
lar danger is a legitimate and ethical choice.
Society says that the things families need to
do to stop domestic abuse focus on how to
maintain the family, how to work with the
man’s problem, where to get counseling,

en must protect themselves

how to help  Where, in all that mess,
is how to help the women? Where do they
tell us how to stay alive?

Leaving is not the cowardly thing to do.

It is not an admission of defeat or an indica—_

tion that the woman is at fault It is not deny-
ing reality because being trapped in an abu-
sive situation is not the only reality. And it is
not an indication of how much a woman
does or does not love her partner.

Women are not being unsupportive of '

their partners’ needs by packing their bags
and getting out. These men are not going to
take the initiative to stop by themselves.
Weeks like this need to encourage women
to do whatever it takes to get their partners
to acknowledge what tl1ey’re doing — even
if it means walking out. Or pressing
charges. ’

“For the most part, the woman is afraid,
and she wants to withdraw the charges
because she thinks [her spouse] is going to
go to jail,” Jo DeBor, legal advocate for the
Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater
Pittsburgh, told the Post-Gazette. “When
she hears he can go into counseling, that
makes her feel better, that maybe he’ll get
some help.”

Three out of 10 men beat their wives
again after counseling. VV1th odds like that,
oﬂicials at women’s shelters and counseling
groups must be on crack to tell victims to go

home again, now that their partners are in

therapy. With odds like that, how can
women feel better, or think that the “sup-
port” they’re giving their man by staying

‘with him outweighs the physical danger

they’re putting themselves in?

If this kind of “support” is the only
things that “keeps the family together,” it’s
time to change the rules, because it’s awful-
ly hard to keep a family together from a hos-
pital .bed. This type of shared reality
between two people can’t exist if one person
doesn’t buy into it The system can only
continue if women acknowledge it as legit-

Nearly 3,000 people are sent by the
courts to the Domestic Abuse Counseling
Center each year in Allegheny County

alone. Of those people, only 1,200 attend all -

the meetings, according to the Post-Gazette.
It doesn’t look like most abusive men care
enough to want to resolve these problems,
does it? Women may think that their partner
would be one of the few to follow through,
but is it worth the risk?

Remember the saying, “No one will
love you until you love yourself?” Well,
sometimes, you have to put yourself first,
especially when it comes to getting out of a
potentially deadly situation. You owe it to
yourself and the people that really love you.
Cesca Antonelli is the managing editor of
The Pitt News and hates seeing women get
pushed around by the men who “love ” them

Before President Clinton or great-gran -
father Dole enact legislation banning frivo-
lous lawsuits, Johnny Majors should sue the
Pitt Panther football fans for non-support.

He’d win. All he would have to do
would be to show a picture of tire student sec-
tion when Billy West scored Saturday’s
game-winning touchdown that saved
Homecoming.

There wasn’t that clear of a view from

One might have been asleep.

No jury in the world (okay, no jury out-
side Southern California) would ﬁnd the stu-
dents irmocent. They have no excuse. '

Some might plead insanity, saying that
they thought the game ended after Tony
Dorsett held up the commemorative trophy
and James Hill and Brittan Forsythe rode
around the track in the convertible, expertly
driven by The Pitt News Football Expat
Matt Grove, I might add .

Others would cite legal precedent,
claiming that Roberto Alomar had a better
chance of getting a close call at the plate than
Pitt had of winning after Temple racked up
52 points. Tapes of the West Virginia, Ohio
State, and Miami games would be brought
into evidence and viewed, quite possibly
causing Panther Paul to jump oﬂ° a cliif

Still others would try even worse excus-
es, like staying home to listen to the dulcet
tones of Bill Hillgrove (or the crew of WPTS
92.1 FM on your sports dial) describe the
action and conduct informative interviews.

Nope, Majors would win this one. At
least, ifhe remembers to call Matt Lytle to
the stand with about 10 minutes left in the
trial

Bad court references aside, this

Julie Cress and Paula
Zemrowski led a bal-
anced attack as the Pitt

.Volleybal1 team made
quick work of the St.
Francis Red Flash last
night at the Fitzgerald
Field House.

Pitt (8-8) used only
eight players’ en route to
the 15-4, 15-4 and 15-6
victory. Freshman hitter
Cress finished with 15
kills and a .571 kill per-
centage. Zemrowski con-
tributed as well, spiking
13 winners and assisting
on one block.

“I actually think that
we could have played
better,” said Zemrowski,
“but we did what we had
to do. We should have
treated this’ as any other
match instead of just let-
ting up.”

Pitt rolled easily
through the first two
games but had trouble
finishing off St. Francis

The Lady Panthers failed
on five match points
before putting the contest
away.

times when you’re watch-
ing a team in warm ups
and you obviously see

and mentally know that

you own them, you can
probably beat that team
and still be bad. The best
teams in the world go
through that.”

St. Francis, who did-

 

n’t have a player over 5-
foot-ll, couldn’t key on
senior Jennie Driscoll
either. The middle hitter
had 11 kills, eight digs,
three blocks and a .625

The women’s soccer

of the year, beating the Saint

“It felt awesome. I had to

Pitt’s Vanessa Madison

“We wanted to test her
on high shots early and it

Beasley then added her

Throughout the ﬁrst half
Pitt dominated play. They

At the end of the regular season,
the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San
Diego Padres played a three—game set
in L.A. to determine postseason seed-
ing. The Padres won the right not to
play the Braves first.

It didn’t matter. A

Both California teams are gone
now, dispatched by three—game
sweeps. The juggernaut Atlanta Braves
and the resurgent Runnin’ Redbirds of
St. Louis are left to fight for the
National League championship. A
position-by—position recap follows:

First Base: No one, at least this
side of the American League, has put
up more consistent numbers at first
than the Braves’ Fred McGriff. The
Crime Dog hasn’t missed a postseason
in recent memory, and is already off to
a fast start, hitting .333 with one home
run versus the Dodgers. The Cards
answer with relative unknown Jeff
Mabry, who has posted mediocre
numbers this year but hit .304 against
Atlanta.

It won’t help. Advantage: Braves.

Second Base: Both Atlanta’s
Mark Lemke and the Cardinals’ Luis
Alicea fill the role of good-field, no-
hit infielders for their respective
teams. Lemke has a wealth of postsea-
son experience to add to his .255 sea-

 

festivals) ?

son average, while Alicea can con-
tribute speed to an equally—mundane
presence at the plate.

The further into the playoffs, the
more experience helps. Advantage:
Braves.

Third Base: Veteran Gary Gaetti
is the hardest—hitting infielder in St.
Louis, but that isn’t saying much. On
the other hand, Chipper Jones may be
the hardest—hitting infielder in the

splitting time at backstop with
Eduardo Perez. Neither one has had
any real impact this season. Tom
Pagnozzi will get the start for the
Cards, and hit under .150 versus
Atlanta this year.

Don’t look for any Carlton Fisk
heroics from this crew. Advantage:
None.

Left Field: The Braves will start
Ryan Klesko and his 34 homers

with apolo- righties, but
gies to Matt Pa H 2 of 2 ' Bobby Cox
Williams. Jones hit .309 with 30 will sit him and his strikeout tenden-

homers and 110 RBI this year.

Experience helps, but it_doesn’t
replace talent. Advantage: Braves.

Shortstop: Jeff Blauser joins
with Lemke to make the most funda-
mentally-sound double—play combina-
tion in baseball. Problem is, Blauser
hit .111 in the division series, and not
much better in the regular season. The
Cards answer with Royce Clayton and
Ozzie Smith, who are both hitting
over .300 in the postseason.

This is a defensive position —
Blauser makes plays, Smith and
Clayton make jaws drop. Look for the
Wizard to see more playing time as the
series rolls on. Advantage: Cards.

Catcher: October pickoff—expert
Javier Lopez has seen better days at
the plate for Atlanta, and is currently

cies against lefty Donovan Osborne.
Klesko’s platoon-mate, rookie
Andruw Jones, is a better in the field
and on the bases than at the plate, but
has improved of late. Ex-Brave Ron
Gant goes for St. Louis, and hit .400
versus the Padres in the divisional
playoff.

This is close, but you can never
underestimate the revenge factor.

Advantage: Cards.

has been stellar in center and at leadoff
for Atlanta, but cooled off in a hurry
against Los Angeles. Cardinal relic‘

ter, but fan favorite and offensive

Relief Pitchers: Mark Wohlers
runs the show for the Braves, but has
little support in the setup section of the
pen. Saint Louis is working on the
same wavelength with Dennis
Eckersley, but recent performances by
middle relievers Rick Honeycutt and
T.J. Mathews have drawn some favor-
able reviews from everybody but
Padre batters.

Barring a Kirk Gibson sighting,
Eck and his crew have the edge.
Advantage: Cards.

“We played well in the ﬁrst half. We
dominated play,” said Head Coach
Roland Sturk. .

In the second half, Pitt seemed to
lose their ﬂow, and Saint Francis took
advantage. They got a breakaway and
defender Heather Ferguson could only
pull on her jersey to stop the break. The
penalty resulted in a direct kick and a
Red Flash goal to make the score 4-2.

Unlike the ﬁrst half, the Red Flash
controlled the ball for most of the second
half and added two more goals to make
it 4-4 with 15 minutes left in the game.

“I think we got a litﬂe too comfort-
able with the lead and let them back in,
the game,” said Beasley.

After giving up the lead, Mascari
scored again on a pass from Bertges.
Mascari settled the pass in front of the

net and then scored to give Pitt a lead
they would not let up.

Beasley then sealed the game with
three minutes left with her third goal of
the game. The hobbling Beasley outran a
defender for the ball, got control and
scored to make the ﬁnal 64. .

“I’m happy _to have a win,” said
Sturk. “I’m a little disappointed that we
let them back in the game. I was hoping
we could shell a team because we have
been on the other end of that a lot this
year. This was a good game for us
because in the end we pulled out the

Weolnescluy, October 9, 1 996

Gridiron senior finally
gets a chance to shine

 

Walking into football practice the
other day, it’s not hard to ﬁnd unknowns
among the few big names that Pitt football
has to oﬁer. Many students know Nnamdi
Nkwuo, but not too many know he’s been
playing football for four years. After all,
his name isn’t quite as recognizable as
Dan Marino or Tony Dorsett.

After asking a couple of the guys
standing on the sidelines if they knew him,
they pointed out a coach exiting the ﬁeld.
Catching up to him before he left the ﬁeld,
he said, “Number 28, in the blue.”

I had found my man. Now I just had
to catch his attention. a

The players were running off the
ﬁeld, and the daunting task of weaving
between the smelly giants lied ahead,
which is not nearly as easy as one might

I think. When word got out that The Pitt

News wanted an interview with him, the
team reaction was interesting, considering
the past relationship between the two enti-
ties.

At this point, a roar went up ﬁom the
other players. They were hooting, holler-
ing, and cheering like it was Keith
Olberrnan. One teammate cried, “You’re
the man, Nnamdi!” as he exited the ﬁeld.
Nkwuo just got a huge smile on his face
and agreed to set up an interview so we
could all learn a little more about him.

Along with being a popular guy on

_ the practice ﬁeld, Nkwuo is an all—around

special teams player and the second back
in on Pitt’s nickel package. Before this
year, he was a defensive back, but the tran-
sition to linebacker has not really been a
problem for him being in the same defen-
sive scheme. He is a ﬁfth—year senior and

is in his fourth year as a member of the

Panther gridiron squad.

In his three previous years, Nkwuo
was a walk—on player for Pitt, but this year
Coach Johnny Majors rewarded his work
ethic with a scholarship.

“Over the years, I have made steady‘

improvement. There were times where
stuff wasn’t going my way, and a lot of
people would have quit, but I stuck it out
and made steady improvement,” Nkwuo
said.

This determination is what has gotten
Nkwuo to this point. ‘

The Bell Atlantic Scholar Athlete and
biology major realizes the importance of
the balancing all  of college life.

“Academics come first, football
comes second, and I guess hangin’ out
comes third.” Nkwuo says, “I remember
days when I thought ‘I don’t know how I
did it.”’ .
The man who shares the same birth-
day as The Pitt News’sports editor said, “I
might have neuroscience, biochemistry,

 

Nkwuo is taking advantage of his
increased playing time so far in '96.
and then practice. I’m up imtil four in the
morning studying.”

Nkwuo didn’t come here to play foot-
ball, though. He came to Pitt to play base-
ball, but after one year, it jus didn’t work
out for him, so he turned to football and
made the best out of it.

Nkwuo is part of a Pitt defense that
has had a rough year. Through six games,
the Panther defense -has surrendered an
average of 43.2.

One of the 10 fastest guys (4.65 40-
yard’ dash) on the team, Nkwuo said,
“We’re not playing up to our potential,
and if we turn it around, things will start to
go our way.”

In his four years on the team, times
have been tough for the Panthers, and one
wonders how he remains optimistic.

“Coach Majors and the other coaches
are always telling us to keep our heads
up,” Nkwuo said. “After a tough loss, you
can’t dwell on it too much because you
have to get up the next day and get ready
for the next wee .”

Nkwuo loves being a part of this
team. _

He said, “We’re all really close.-We
haven’t done as well as we should have, or
want to, but everyone’s giving it their all,
and we’re going to get this thing together.
There is a lot to be attained.”

Looking back on the last four years,
Nkwuo has no regrets and is happy that he
stuck it out and earned a scholarship.

He said, “I knew I could play, so I
stuck it out.”

Look for number 28 to keep working
hard and sticking it out. Also look for him
to make a big play this year for the Panther
football squad, and remember. that he was
a walk-on just last year. ‘
