Shanty  
built for
cause of

homeless

By John Berger and

Scot Ross
The Pitt News

lt is a set of cardboard walls,
approximately 5'/2 feet high and
about 7 feet around, stapled to a
wooden skeleton and topped
with a sheet of plywood. One of
its architects, Student Action Un-

ion President Jay Katz, claimed, 9

"lt’s symbolic, but not for all of

us; for a couple of us, thiswill be '

our home for the next week.”
This describes the shanty the
SAU constructed on the grass out-
side the William Pitt Union in an
effort to raise canned foods and
clothing, as well as conscious-

ness, for the plight of the

homeless. -
Katz explained that the SAU
members who will be dwelling in '
the shanty over the next week
"want to try to be living like the
homeless. You can read volumes
and volumes about what home-
lessness is about or pick up a
magazine or a newspaper "or a"
book, but when you’-re out here,
it's just much more valuable, and
it makes us angrier that the
problem exists in the first place.”
The SAU decided to construct
a shanty in addition. to collecting
food and clothing because they
felt, as Katz explained, ''It would
be more effective. Sure, we're
collecting clothes, but we're also
going to be passing out some in-
formation and having a lot of
people stopping by and saying,
‘Hey, what's this all about?’
“There's a lot of us here who

. have been reading up on home-

lessness and are going to try to
explode some of the mythsthat
all the homeless are lazy, be-
cause current statistics we read

A text of Romania's statement,
which was made in a closed-door
meeting and distributed later by
its state news agency Agerpres,
said Bucharest ”takes no pledge”
to stick to commitments on great-
er religious freedom and
emigration.

U.S. Ambassador Warren Zim-

In Czechoslovakia, meanwhile,
riot police used water cannons,
batons and dogs to break up
crowds of almost 2,000 people at

an hour after the accord was
adopted. ,

consensus of the 35 nations who

Sunday, killing at least 110 peo-

As many as 1,000 people were

said.
”Oh, God! Give brother back!”

wailed 25-year-old Sunil Daniel,‘

beating his chest and sobbing for
his brother Susanta, who was
killed.

He was among thousands of
anguished people who thronged
fields nearthe wreckage of four
derailed cars. Police tried to keep
relatives and friends from trying
to find loved ones among rows of
bodies laid alongside the track in

”Hundreds of bodies were
lined up on both sides of the two
shattered trains,” said Syed

sel disease dropped 24 percent
over the past decade, but it re-
mains by far the nation's biggest
killer, taking a life every 32 se-

”The good news is that we con-

killer of our population,” said Dr.
Bernadine Healy of the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation,
who is president of the Heart As-

”Those trends are dramatic and
don't seem to be reversing,” she
said. ”The bad news is that heart

got a long way to go.”

The association released the

Congressmen get pay
hikefor doing nothing

U.S. congressmen are up for a 50 percent pay hike this
year and many people, including most congressmen, have
voiced opposition to it. It is a questionable point, however,
whether congressional action speaks louder than words.

In order for the pay raise not to pass, Congress must vote
it down. If Congress fails to vote, either way, the pay raise

takes effect automatically.

In 1987, when a similar pay—raise. bill was introduced,
the Senate voted against it, but the House delayed its vote
until the day after the deadline. Such action is easily ac-
complished when a congressman engages in a fillibuster,
extended speaking to stall a call for a vote until after the
deadline. Once the voting deadline was past, the House
voted down the pay raise. By then it didn't matter.

This time, congressmen will get a $46,000 raise, their

fourth raise in five years. Now there is an additional piece '

of legislation which would ban outside income, such as
fees for speaking engagements. This ban, however, must
be voted on by both chambers and passed before becom-
ing law. Unfortunately, chances are this ban will be easi-
ly buried in a sea of congressional red tape.

Members of congress must start putting their votes where
their mouths are on Feb. 8, the deadline to vote on the
newest pay raise. We expect our representatives to make
decisions, not speeches. If Congress really opposes the
pay raise, it must vote it down. By remaining silent, Con-
gress removes itself from the accountability of its actions
and still receives more money.

With the perks and benefits congressmen get, it is highly
debatable whether or not they deserve such a raise. But
whether they deserve it or not, they will get it anyway,

ironically, by doing nothing.

George Bush's Cabinet is
emerging as a nearly all male, all
Republican establishment, but
women and conservatives are
holding their fire.

Bush's honeymoon period is
quite a contrast to eight years ago
when conservatives voiced out-
rage over several of Ronald Rea-

ANALYSIS

gan’s Cabinet choices.

The Reagan transition was
marked by regular denunciations
by conservatives of such Cabinet
choices as Donald T._Regan for
treasury secretary and Malcolm
Baldrige for commerce secretary.

No such outcry has greeted the

Bush Cabinet, although most of
the choices are no more accept-
able to conservatives. The only
Bush Cabinet appointee to rank
as a conservative hero is former
Rep. Jack Kemp, the choice‘ to
head the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
. Craig Shirley, a conservative
consultant who backed Bush for
the GOP presidential nomina-
tion, said there is a mixed
response to the emerging ad-
ministration.

”Some are very delighted be-
cause Bush struck conservative

themes during the campaign and
he hasn't changed on any of

those,”.he said. ”Others are tak- .

ing more of ag wait—and-see atti-
tude, and then there are the
historical Bush—bashers.”

One of the 'longtime Bush-
bashers is Richard Viguerie, a
conservative fund—raiser who was
an early and outspoken critic of
Reagan's Cabinet choices.

”The consensus [among con-
servatives] is: this is not the time,
let's wait,” said Viguerie. ”There
is nothing to be_gained by going
out there and pounding the table
now.” '

Viguerie was less restrained
than many of his conservative al-

lies, and he described the Bush 5
" titude toward appointing women,

appointments as ”very disillu-
sioning, discouraging and disap-
pointing.” '

Throughout his campaign and
since winning the presidency,
Bush has emphasized his desire
to reach out and bring into
government people ”who are too

- often overlooked." V
If by that he meant women, so

far he has fallen short.

’’I keep being told, give it
time,” said Nancy Thompson, a
Republican consultant who was
a Bush delegate to th'e 1988
Republican National Convention.

"’I’ve got my fingers crossed.”

Bush picks are questionable  

Thompson and Susan McLane,
a Republican state senator in
New Hampshire, chose to praise
the women Bush -has chosen

rather than bemoan thoseleft out. *9‘

Both cited the selection of
Elizabeth Dole to head the Labor
Department and Carla Hills to be

trade representative as encourag- r

ing, choices.

But McLane conceded that
women still appear to be at a
stage where they must» be satis-
fied «with one or two‘ high-

”I think we are still at that age,”
she said. I

As for the president-elect’s at-

she said, ”I don't think George
Bush has thought about it that
much, and he hasn't thought
about it as something important.”

”There are only a very few of
those top, top spots,”' said’
Thompson. ”And to have two —
1‘/2, if you will, [Hills would have
Cabinet status but not run a full
department] — that are that visi-
ble, that's good.”

Donald .M.. Rothbergp is the
chief political writer of the As-
sociated Press.

Reagan made Americans proudto be Americans 

By this time next week, Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan, the oldest
and most conservative chief ex-

‘ ecutive ever to have served this

republic, will have been trans-
formed into Mr. Ronald Reagan.
As ofjan. 20, Reagan will be the

—. first president to successfully

complete two full terms in office

. since Dwight Eisenhower.

During his eight years in the
White House, the Gipper used
the chance of a lifetime to change
the course of America. He did
this with the strength, courage

«and perseverance of a man half

his age. Reagan did this by mak-

' ing Americans believe in them-

selves again. During the '70s, the
United States had lost confidence
in herself. She was betrayed by

, . . Watergate and Vietnam (see also:

 the Media), directionless under
I - the Fordadministration and gun-

a . tion. Minutes after Reagan wa‘s.i.n-.

augurated as our 40th president,
the Iranian government released
the 52 Americans who had been
held hostage for 444 days.
Although their release might not
have had any relevance to the
emergence of Reagan as presi-
dent, it nonetheless
shadowed the tonelfor the rest of

his administration — better times
ahead. . i '
Reagan started the no-nonsense
ball rolling early on when he
fired federal air traffic controllers
who were illegally striking in
1981. This is the same watershed
year that sawlthe Kemp-Roth tax
bill, which gave the United
States’ her largest tax cut‘ ever.
Many economists attribute our
present economic recovery, ‘now

fore- .

in peacetime, to this bill.

Without a doubt, Reagan's first
four years in office were his best
—— with his left hand he would
smash pork barrel legislature, and
with his right handibeef up the
military and save the Social Secu-
rity system with rare bipartisan
support.

The military even got a well-
needed shot of testosterone, and
on Oct. 25,, 1983, U.S. Marines
and a small force from six Carib-
bean nations invaded the island
of Grenada. A few days later, the
Grenadian and Cuban forces
were overcome. And 1983 was

also a crucial year for NATO.-

With great resolve, President Rea-
gan convinced the leaders of
Western Europe to accept Persh-

ing II missiles to offset the legion.‘

of Soviet missiles pointed at their
respective capitals; Although this

. set the "No Nukes” gadflies -wah-

wahing‘ ‘about nucllear’ ‘ catas-

 

trophe, ‘Thatcher and Company
proved to be -worth their weight
in wheat and consented to Rea-
gan's plea.

But Reagan wasn't finishéd. To
prove that he, too, worried about

.nuclear war, accidental or not,

the Gipper announced funding
for the Strategic Defense Initia-
tive, a space shield which, once
operational, would protect this
republic from a nuclear attack.
This, however, found the loony
Left unsatiated; it perorated the
dangerof self-defense and how‘
the Soviet Union would not take
kindly to superior technology.
During Reagan's second term
in office there was a significant
decrease in the leaps and bounds
Reagan had made toward the
Right. Although 1986 had its
highlights (bombing Libya, ap-
pointment of Judge Antonin Sca-

lia_ ), it was also the year.‘ for the V ~
.begi‘nnin'g of the 100th Congress- -

 

   
 

and the Iran-Contra scandal. The
following year, with the defeat of
Judge Bork and the groundwork
for the INF Treaty, wasn't much
better. Dutch, it seemed, was be-
ginning to show signs of wear
and tear.

The new year is just beginning,
but ”Morning in America” has
changed into dusk. Reagan‘ is
creaking out of the Oval Office

(

with his ratings approval high up 

into the stratosphere. Sure, the
deficit is a problem, but no one
seriously expects another Great
Depression anytime soon; Rea-
gan can return to California se-
cure in the fact that the ”misery ‘
index” (unemployment-inflation)
is low, that no ‘country was lost
to communism under his watch,

»and that Americans are once,

againproud to be Americans.

THE PITT NEWS

The evil that men do...

Nihilism is defined in an old
Webster's dictionary as "the doc-
trine that all values are worthless
and that nothing is knowable or
can be communicated.”

This is not precisely my belief.

Values have worth. They give
us standards by which to live.
They should protect us and others
from being hurt by the willful ac-
tion of another human being.

And communication is obvi-
ously possible. The fact of this
column is evidence of that. I will
concede that the extent and ac-
curacy of communication is not
quantifiable. There is simply no
way to verify how much of what
you say or write or do is under-
stood by other people. We can
assume that ifsomeone accom-
modates our requests or responds
.to our statements in a way that is
suitable, then they have grasped
at least some essential element of
our intent. Therefore, I repeat,
some level of communication is
possible.

When I use the word nihilism,

Awuknwak. Awuknwak is de-
fined by Dr. Richard Scaglion as

are obsessed with the idea of
figuring out how people acquire
knowledge. In this case, awukn—
wak is used to answer a question
which really has no bearing or

relevance to anything, or else-

doesn't merit-an answer -— i.e.,

I tend to misuse it to mean that
there is an essential imbalance of
good and evil that makes the
world unworthy‘ of continued ex-

BERGER

istence.

This, I think, should be some-
what apparent.

On any given day, millions and
billions of acts of cruelty are per-
petrated on human beings by
other human beings.

No ultimate good, no heaven
or hell, no utopian society of fu-
ture days can ever be worth the

pain that can drive one person to ‘

suicide. No values or othenNor|d-
ly justice can ever make _up for
the rape of one innocent woman.

Nothing can compensate for the‘
ruthless push into insanity caused -

by one abusive parent.

Heaven is supposedly the place
of eternal happiness, where those
who have suffered~on the earth

...isn’t

why is the sky blue? —— Awukn-
wak (dumb question, who cares).

At’/vuknwak is probably the
greatest word that mankind has
ever come up with, as it can now
be used as the universal answer
to such questions as: Is there real-
ly a God? Awuknwak. If someone
went back in time and killed my
mother before I’ was born, would
lstill exist? Awuknwak. And so
on. _

Many eons ago, a caveman sat
down on a stone * after being
skunked on the latest wooly
mammoth hunt and pondered
the great eternal question: Just
what the devil am I doing on this

planet in the first place? Thus was.

philosophy born.

If you've just read John Berger's
column, you know that he's pret-
ty upset by all the apparent use-
less suffering of millions 'of
"people on this planet. God, it
would appear,’ is pretty much at
blame here for letting all this
mayhem go-on. Nobody deserves
to suffer, so ifthere really is an all-

receive their reward. But how can
‘even an eternity of happiness and
bliss make up for the scars that
are inflicted on a young man or
woman who is sexually abused
by someone he or she trusted or
loved? How does an eon of con-
tentment make up for 40 years of
hunger and disease in Ethiopia?

What, to me, is even more
flawed with the idea of heaven is
that, according to most Christian
beliefs, you must meet certain
conditions to get there in the first
place. An almost universal axiom
is that a person who is driven to
suicide, as a last, desperate me-
ans of stoppingthe pain, is de-
nied the reward of. heaven and
instead consigned to the pits of
hell. I am not excusing suicide.

It is another of the wanton acts of.

cruelty that make the world into
this foul, dark place_. But, there
are times when I cannot bring
myself to fault those who resort
to it.

And a merciful God couldn't
condemn a lonely, confused at-

knowing, omni—benevolentGod
why hasn't he come down and
put a stop to this nonsense?
Well, if there's an answer, it's
awuknwak. It's pretty much a
waste of a person's time to sit
around wondering why all this
badness goes on, because it quite
obviously does. Further still, it's

,'been going onusince man can

remember remembering. The last
time someone came around with
the intent of putting a stop to
suffering and furthering the good,
honest life of helping your neigh-
bor, he was nailed to a cross like
every other common ragamuffin
the Roman Empire wanted to get
rid of.

But is there really more evil
than good down here on this
planet? Awuknwak. Is it God's
responsibility to remedy this
problem? Awukn.wak. Essentially,
this good and evil stuff just plain
old. exists, and there really isn't a
damn thing anybody can do

about it besides putting up with I

"it-

tempt to escape.

What about the idea that some-
day there will be a grand utopi-
an society on earth? How does
this justify the incredible pain that
goes on now, that has gone on for
thousands of years, since the birth
of civilization? _

What we end up with here is
the basic concept of end vs. me-
ans. Does the end justify the
means?

If one concedes that the world
should continue in this path, then
one is conceding that the end
does justify the means. And if one
concedes that, one is opening the
door to-all "kinds of abuse of hu-
manity’s abilities, purely on the
basis of a subjective assessment
of the worthiness of the end that
is sought, and the also subjective
assessment of the correct means
to achieve that end.

This can excuse all kinds of be-
havior. While some people do
things with the intention of hurt-
ing people and causing pain, a
great deal more start with the best

worth wasting my

Moaning, whining, or crying
about all the terrible things going
on isn't going to get rid of all the
injustice in the world, and neither
are a half-dozen bleeding-hearts
with messiah complexes. It
would be awfully nice if every-
one grabbed a copy of the New
Testament and decided to love
their neighbors, but half the peo-
ple in the world don't subscribe
to Christianity. Life might suck,
but since I'm already here I may
as well put up with it.

No one can deny that a ran-
dom act of violence, such as the
rape of a woman, is a terrible
thing. But does this make the
world a terrible, evil place?
Awuknwak.

If there is a God, He's not let-
ting me in on the secret. Then
again, I'm not really concerned
with the question. If God is as
great and benevolent as He's
cracked up to be, He must know
what He's_doing, and since He's
not telling me anything, He must
want me not to worry about it.

Monday, January 16, I989 

of intentions, and their means are 4

so wrong that all they succeed in
doing is hurting a great number
of people. i

So my question comes down to
this: What end could possibly
justify the suffering and the

slaughter of millions of innocents Q
in its name? All of the atrocities _

I have mentioned in the above
paragraphs, what end could pos-
sibly be worth such pain? _

I cannot accept any answer I
have yet heard. I cannot see that
the hope of heaven, orthe ideal
of utopia, or even the beauties of

an, of love, can come even close -

to making up for the price that is
being paid, even now.

For one person to die from ‘pain
is too much. The breaking of one
person's mind is too much.

If there is a God, the only thing
I want from him is for him to end
the situation. The world does not
deserve to go on existing.

Nothing is worth the price that
is always paid by the most in-
nocent

breath on

This, however, is not tacit ap-
proval to rape, pillage and murd-
er, but I can't prove that
(therefore, awuknwak).

Thinking about all the pain and
suffering that goes on needlessly
only results in depressing people
and depressing conversation. Ig-

noring the supposed problem

doesn’t make it go away.

But is the world really more I

evil than it is good? Is God ulti-
mately responsible for all of our
problems, and if so, why does he
continue to let this mess go on?
When God created rainbows and
promised to keep His hands off
the earth, did He mean that He
wouldn't help us, or just wouldn't
hurt us?
AWUKNWAK.

OK KO’d

Basketball team upsets highly ranked Oklahoma, 99-911  

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Up until last Wednesday, Pitt
had never lost two straight games
under current Coach Paul Evans.
That changed with a 76-57 loss
to Georgetown following a 95-83
loss at the hands of Boston Col-
lege. Many thought that the streak
would run to three when they
faced the third-ranked Oklahoma
Sooners yesterday afternoon.

The Panthers proved all wrong
when they stunned the Sooners,
99-91, in front of a packed Fitz-

gerald Field House.

"Pitt did a helluva job," Okla-
homa Coach Billy Tubbs said.
"They stayed with us both emo-
tionally and physically. They_cer-
tainly deserved the game.”

The loss improved the Panthers
to 8-6. Oklahoma dropped to
13-2.

-' The game started out slowly for
the Panthers. They couldn't break
the Sooner press and were quick-

A ly down 18-8. -Then the alarm

rang in the players’ heads, and
they started to ‘get back into the

game.

Center Bobby Martin hit a lit-
tle hook shot from the top of the
lane, and the Panthers were ready
to play. Shorter followed with a
finger roll off a fast break.

The Panthers were on a 15-9
run to take the lead for good,
33-27.

"We did what we had to do,”
Pitt forward Rod Brookin said.
"We put everything together to-
day. That's what we have to do
to be a good team."

Shorter and Brookin took over
almost exclusively with a series
of driving layups and fast break

buckets as the Panthers used their
running game to break the Soon-
er press and pad the lead.

''I think I lost about seven
pounds today,” Brookin, who has
been scrutinized for his weight,
said. "-Maybe we should play Ok-
lahoma every Sunday afternoon.”

Pitt wasn't about to stop now.
They continued to run with the
ball, and they eventually padded
the lead to seven points at the
eight-minute mark after Shorter
sunk a pair of free throws.

"Maybe this is the game that
will get us going,” Pitt guard Sean

some Final Foursome of 1986.
That's right, the Yellow—Streak —

"Delight in the thrills of the

they're supposed to win (80-79
loss to Siena, 80-76 loss to Du-
quesne, 95-83 loss to Boston Col-
lege), and winning the games
they're supposed to lose (81-76
over second-ranked Syracuse,
90-87 over the Florida Gators).

Add to that list Pitt's 99-91 ‘up-

set victory over the third—ranked 1

Oklahoma Sooners on Sunday,

_ and you shed new light on an 8-6

season that could easily turn sour.

Will the emotion of the Okla-
homa win vault the-Panthers to
more wins in the parity-filled Big
East?

''I haven't got a clue,-" said Pitt
Coach.Paul Evans. ''I hope so.”

The players‘ had their own
ideas.

ready, we're capable of playing
with anyone in -the country,” said

sophomore forward Brian Short-
er,- who scored a career-high 37

PANTHER
NOTEBOOK

in the Oklahoma game.

Shorter said that the team's
losses against "rinky-dink" teams,
as Jerome Lane might have called
them last year, were not due to
lack of interest or intensity.

"We have a tendency to lapse
on defense,” he said.

"We know what we're capable
of doing," -Shorter added.

Point guard Sean Miller con-
curred.

”We’re just young. We're

' showing what we're capable'of,."

Miller said.

"We're capable of playing like
this all the time,” said junior Rod
Brookin, who came off the bench
to score a career-best 24 points.
''I don't know what it is."

Evans does. "We're fortunate
to beat a team like that. We
lucked out." .

0 The Panthers broke a two-
game losing streak against the
"Sooners. Oklahoma defeated Pitt
96-93 in the second round of the

1987 NCAA Tournament and
86-83 in a non-conference game
at Norman, Okla., last season.

0 The Fitzgerald Field House
was dressed out like Rupp Arena
for the Oklahoma contest, tele-
vised nationally by CBS, and Pitt
fans also turned out their best
showing this season, much to the
—lil<ing of Evans. -

Miller said. ''I was a little worried
early because we were not break-.
ing their pressure. Once we got
that under control and I started to
get the ball more, we startedito
execute our offense." I _
Miller then added, ''I‘ never

thought we had it in the bag. A ‘

team like that can always come-
back/’

Pitt was led by Brian Shorter’s
career-high 37 points and 12 re-
bounds. The Sooners were paced
by Mookie Blaylock's 37 points.
Stacy King led Oklahoma with
nine rebounds.

Oklahoma drew within three

points a few times late in the first ..

half, but Pitt was able to hold
them off to go into the locker
room leading 55-49.
"[Blaylock] was about the only
thingwe had going for us offen-
sively in the first half,'' Tubbs
said. "He had a great game. He
is every bit as good as 1 think he
is." V
Oklahoma came out of the gate
in the second half with renewed
vigor. They scored the first two
buckets and cut the lead to two
before Shorter put in a shot off the
glass to fire the Panthers back up.
Jason Matthews and Miller
follwed with three-pointers and

I Pitt led 63-53. After a television

time-out, Matthews hit a layup
and Pitt streched it to 12 points.

"We got good play out of most
of the kids," Evans said. "We
were able to hold down their big
guys and control the tempo. The
crowd really got us into it, and
we were able to beat a very fine
team."

This was a game that Pitt could
have easily lost if they didn't keep
the intensity up. When Darelle
Porter committed his fourth foul
early in the half, Oklahoma went
on a six-point run to cut the lead-
to six. Shorter followed with a
strong move to the hoop and was
fouled by Andre Wiley.

The game rotated between six
and eight points until the,Soon-
ers went on a semi-run to cut it.

close again: \

I Late victory gives wrestling team a

tie against highly ranked Nebraska

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team opened
its season with a 16-16 tie against
13th-ranked Nebraska (2-4-1),
last Thursday at ,Greensburg—
Salem High School.

The match was extremely phys-
ical, mostly on Nebraska's part,
as the Cornhuskers were consis-
tently warned for grabbing sin-
glets, head gear and faces.

Nebraska head coach Tim
Neumann was disappointed
coming away with a tie, especial-
ly after losing to Clarion Univer-
sity the night before.

”We felt like we out-wrestled
them in every match. We had
some really bad calls, but Pitt
wrestled a good match. I thought
both teams were fairly even
ability-wise; the kids were close,

but we’re just disappointed with J

a tie after what happened last
night at Clarion,” Neumann said.
The first match of the night at
118 pounds set the tone for the
rest of the evening. Pitt wrestler
Bob Simpson pulled out an 11-10
victory over Jim Sanchez in a
barn-burner of a match.

A At 126, Pitt's Matt Rizzo took
on 10th~ranked Jason Kelber,
who was warned numerous times
about face scraping and grabbing
head gear.

Rizzo said, "Those guys are
just real physical. I thought I had

I a real good match, and I was get-

ting the momentum until I got
dinged in the head.

”I think they're upset about the
officiating and tie because they
expected to come in here and
have an easy time with us."

Pitt's biggest victory, and the
most blatant display of physical
wrestling, came in the 150-pound
division as Pitt's Scott Hovan
defeated Paul Herrera by a tally
of 22-1 1. Hovan won a four—point
major decision to put Pitt up for
the match, 10-6.

Herrera had a few points taken
away for grabbing Hovan’s face
and head gear.

”I don't know if their team was
dirty, sometimes those things just
happen in the sport,” Hovan said.
’’I thought he was blocking
around the eyes a lot, maybe a lit-
tle too much.”

Jeff Turner (158), having just
returned from a knee injury, was
obviously out of shape as fatigue
took its toll early in the second
period, since hewas handed a
17-10 loss by Huskerjeff Coltvet.

”Fatigue was definitely a factor.
I've only been wrestling live for
about a week and my legs just felt
like jelly,” Turner said.

It was a homecoming for Pitt's
Perry Miller (190), who graduat-
ed from Greensburg-Salem High

School two years ago. It was most 0

fitting that the hometown hero
would wrestle the match that
would decide Pitt's fate. '

With the score tied at 13 and

only one match following Miller,

IGH TECHNOLOGY IN PITTSBURGHI

Pitt had its chance to take the
lead. Miller was tied with Husker
Tom Robbins at three, going into
the third period. However, Rob-
bins was awarded one point for
an escape with only 20 seconds
to go in the match, and he came
out with a 4-3 victory.

’’It was a downer to lose the
match that would have won it for
the team,” Miller said. ”But it

was exciting to come back [to A

Greensburg—Salem]; there was a
great atmosphere tonight.”

Pitt head coach Rande Stott-
lemyer thinks his wrestlers need
to adopt a more physical, in-
timidating style, much like that of
Nebraska.

”What can I say? I think we
didn't wrestle real well. I wasn't
pleased with our performance.

”Nebraska wrestles hard,
they're a real physical team. I ad-
mire that trait in a team. It's some-
thing we don’t have enough of,”
Stottlemyer said.

The Pitt-Penn State women's
swim meet was supposed to be
close, with a slight edge given to
Penn State. However, in a terrif-
icgteam effort, Pitt beat Penn State

' ‘ quite easily, 171-129, on Satur-

day at Trees Pool.

’’It was a great meet,” said Pitt
Coach David Belowich. ”The
support of the team at this meet
was as good as it [has] ever been.
It was a complete team effort.”

‘It was the last home dual meet
for Pitt this season, and beating
Penn State was especially gratify-
ing for the Pitt seniors.

 

’’It was really special to beat
Penn State in my last dual home
meet,” said senior Maureen
Cleary. ’’It took a lot of team-
work,.although I thought it would
be closer.”

Senior Tricia Rickert added,
”This was a great confidence
booster for everyone. We really
came together as a team.”

Cleary placed fifth in the
200—meter freestyle event, sixth in

the 200 breaststroke and eighth '

in the 200 individual medley.
Rickert placed fourth in the 200
freestyle, sixth in the 50 and 100
freestyle events and was part of
a victorious 400 freestyle relay
team.

That relay, consisting of
Christine Gallagher, Celeste Mak-
iel and Laure Walczak, was one
of 10 first-place finishes for Pitt on
the day.

Senior diver Margie Paulick
won both the 1-meter and the
3-meter diving events. .

”l felt really relaxed,” said Pau- -

lick. ”l was just having fun.”

Junior diver Krissa-Ratliff, still
battling a hip injury, placed sec-
ond on the 3-meter board and
third on the 1—meter. Pitt's only
other competing diver, Mindy
Hennon, placed fifth on the
3—meter and sixth on the 1-meter
board.

Laura Lee Sullivan, Noelle Barry
and Gallagher.

Sophomore Theresa Picklo

kept the momentum going by
winning the 1,000 freestyle event
in 10:29.02. Liz Sari placed sec-
ond in the event and Caroline
Day finished third. This built up
a lead that Pitt would not
relinquish.

_ Sullivan also came from behind
and won.the exciting 200 in-
dividual medley event ' in
2:10.60, beating Penn State's
Kristen Elias. ‘Masal placed third
in the event. ‘

place for Pitt. She won the 100
backstroke in 1:00.30. Janine

6 Evans said that Brookin, who
was battling a weight problem
earlier in the season, ”Broke 235
pounds this week,” helping him
better his season-high by five
points. I

’’It was nice to see Rod Brookin
back,” Evans said of the 1986 Big
East All-Freshman Team member.

Brookin, however, pointed to

fﬁone thing as having helped him

break out: ’’I didn't eat
breakfast."
°Six players — Shorter,

Brookin, Miller, Bobby Martin,
Darelle Porter and Jason Mat-
thews scored all‘ of Pitt's
points, even though 11 Panthers
saw time in the game. Only Nate
Bailey did not play.

STANFORD. Calif.— Lewis
Tillman of Jackson State rushed
for 86 yards and a touchdown
and Pitt linebacker Jerry Olsavsky
scored on a 75-yard interception
return as the East beat the West
24-6 in the East—West Shrine
Game on Sunday.

Tracy Johnson also ran for a
touchdown and the East defense
bottled up the injury-depleted
West offense throughout the day

‘in the 64-year-old collegiate all-

stat, game.

Rick Walsh of New Mexico

provided the only West points
with two first-half field goals.
Arkansas’ 6—foot—4 defensive
back Steve Atwater, one of sever-
al potential first—rou_nd draft picks
on hand, intercepted two passes

school career and single-season '

rushing records, earned offensive-
player honors by averaging 4.4
yards on 19 carries and bulling in

second quarter.

Olsavsky’s spectacular run
clinched the victory late in the
fourth period. With the West trail-

drive, he picked off an errant pass
by Oregon State's Erik Wilhelm
and eluded two.last—gasp attempt-
