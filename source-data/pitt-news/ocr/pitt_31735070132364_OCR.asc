  Pitt hosts ﬁlm, talk  

about homosexuality

NICK KEPPLER
» Staff Writer

Pitt’s Women’s St11dies Department kicked
off its fall speaker series Friday With a showing
of the documentary, ‘The Celluloid Closet,” fol-
lowed by a discussion that scrutinized homo—
sexual stereotypes in today’s entertainment

ﬁelds. a , .

It may seem odd that the Women’s Studies
Department began its speaker series with a ﬁlm
— especially one that examines portrayalsof
homosexuals of both genders ir1 cinema

But Allen Larson, aprofessor of communi-

_ cations at Pitt, gave a scholarly introduction to

the ﬁlm and led a discussion afterward.
7‘In terms of Women’s studies and gender

studies, sexuality and sexual orientation have '

always been at the heart of the discussions we
have,” Carol Stabile, director of the Women’s
Studies Department, said. ‘
“Over the last year, this has been a hot topic
nationally, with a big discussion about gay mar-
riage. Locally, a topic of big discussion is that
Pitt continues to refuse to extend beneﬁts to
same sex partners,” she added. 4
The Celluloid Closet,” a 1996 HBO docu-
mentary, recounts the history of homosexual
characters and homosexual undertones in
American cinema, from two men dancing
cheek-to-cheek in an 1895 Thomas Edison reel
to Tom Hanks’ Oscar-winning performance in
the movie “Philadelp ' ” , ,
The post—ﬁlm discussion quickly turned to
current portrayals -of gays and lesbians in the
entertainrnent.indust1'y. Many’ in the -audience

expressed their distaste for the stereotypical
gays of sitcoms like “Will and Grace”- and real-
ity shows like “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.”

Larson pointed out that such mainstream
shows are produced by heterosexuals and meant
for a heterosexual audience, mostof which is

‘ more comfortable with caricaturesthan three-

dimensional gay characters.

‘~‘I don’t think there is any reason to think pi

that the representation won’t be on the terms and
in the interests of the articulators, and that is
almost never us,” he said. . ,

Many audience members said they prefer
programs that simply happen to be about homo-
sexuals, rather than ones themed around homo-
sexuality. '

Samuel Buelow mentioned an episode of
Animal Planet’s “Pet Story” that documented a

a lesbian couple’s adoption of a pet

‘.”Ihe main storywas about a guide dog
who happens to be fostered by a lesbian cou-
ple,” he said. “It was really interesting to see a
portrayal of queer people in an arena Where the
fact that they were queer really wasn’t an is-sue.”

. Stabile brought "up Tara and Willow, sup-
porting characters on the horror drama “Buffy
the Vampire Slayer” who shared a lesbian rela-
tionship.

“It was ‘dealt with in the same way, you
would deal with any emerging heterosexual
relationship,” Stabile remarked. “Every other
time you see that, it’s either mythologized or it’s
centralized or it’s fetish-ized, and this was just a

little love story that happened the way love sto- _

ries happen. That’s the  of thing we 11
more of.” V A _ _ "

Bookstore ﬂooded with sewage, Sennott Square ﬂooded with water

‘ -The University Book Center had what,
was described as a “toilet-paper problem”
this weekend. ' ‘ K  V

According to Pitt- spokesman John. _ ,
Fidele, toilet paper delivered to Pitt on Sept.

which prevented it from disintegrating
when ﬂushed. Asa result, pipes got clogged,
and sewage built up. The sewage then began

“That’s a huge prob1em,*’_Fide1e..said
There was only minor damage to the
ceiling tiles and merchandise," he said,

pay for any damages and plumber’s~ ser-

The janitorial staﬁ used disinfecting
supplies to help kill ﬂie genns and clean the
store.Fidele was not sure whether the ﬂood-

American ﬂag pins should be a non—issue

For a week after a Sept. 2, 2003,
memo was circulated, corrections
officers inthe state of Pennsylvania
were not allowed to wear American
flag pins or yellow ribbons on their
uniforms.

Officers said the pins and rib-
bons were apolitical statements of
support for troops in Iraq, including
473 reservists who had been called
from the veteran—heavy ranks of
Pennylvania’s corrections officers.

Corrections Secretary Jeffrey A.-
Beard said they violated the uni-
form policy, could be seen as polit-
ical statements and could put pres-
sure on those who elected not to
wear the pins. _

The ban — only on the ﬂags,
not the ribbons — has been tem-
porarily lifted until a compromise
can be reached. ‘

It seems the only reason good
sense has prevailed, however, is
coincidence.

On Sept. 2, state Rep. David

Argall, R—Schuylkil1, happened to

be touring State , Correctional
Institute Graterford and got wind of
the memo.

He was so disgusted with
Beard’s “overreaction” that he fired
off a letter to Gov. Ed Rendell. In
the ensuing hubbub, Beard has
backed down temporarily.

Why is this fight being fought?

Why on Earth are such big guns as
Rendell and Argall being drawn in?
This controversy is a non—issue. It’s
an outrageous waste of time, energy
and ink.

It’s prison -guards — not prison
inmates — who are at the center of
this silly debate. These are men and
women making a living trying to
better society. They, unlike their
charges, didn’t give up some of
their rights when they entered the
prison system.

Sure, uniforms are important. If
a riot broke out, though, a tiny flag
or ribbon pin won’t confuse the
SWAT teams so much that they
shoot the wrong folks.

Beard raised one almost logical
point. If everyone who wants to

"wear a pin does so, those who don’t A

may be subject to hairy—eyeballed
looks and muttered statements
about patriotism. In these paranoid
times, however, any American can
be taken to task for her insufficient
number of pieces of ﬂair. It’s just
an occupational hazard of-being an
American and shouldn’t be legislat-
ed out of existence. '

Hopefully the prison system can
relax and allow publieservants to
make an innocuous statement — at
least until someone tries to wear a
French flag. That will be ‘a whole
other can of ideological escargot.

An ode to Hunter, replacement sibling and K-9 of my eye  

Moments after my brother Gabe and I left the
house, my parents had the brilliant idea of buying
a pet as a replacement brother so Jonathan would-
n’t turn into some socially inadequate, loner trans-
vestite. ,

Like my dad says, “Loving a dog is like loving
a very furry, very mentally challenged
human.”

So, we decided on a_pooch.

My pop is also a ridiculous, “let’s
save half of a sugar packet” kind of
miser, so he went for a $10 mutt from
the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals: a problem-child
Golden Retriever-Chowchow mix
named Hunter. 5 I‘

and I doubt my parents realized just

Another time, this bastard kid came to the
house and fed Hunter two of those Chanukah
chocolates that look like coins, golden
foil and all. i

The dog liqui-crapped all over the house for
the next three days and dragged his anus all over
the kitchen ﬂoor, leaving behind cher-
ry-chocolate streaks. . i

Fortunately, that never happened
again. I

Hunter discovered his niche, and
the family fell in love with this brain-
deficient beastie.

My father could constantly be
found holding impassioned, one-sided
conversations with the dog, since no
one else ‘wanted to listen to him.

Several times, Hunter -— in a misplaced sense

' good thing, since no one’s tried to hump her in

years.

Without a doubt, "some of the fondest times of
my life were when Jonathan and I would take
Hunter and his dog posse to a forest creek 20 min-
utes from our. home.

During every drive to this forest, there in a
cramped ’91 Subaru Legacy brimming with four
spastic, panting dogs, Leo — the 10-year-old
Dalmatian — gets so excited that he grows an
obnoxiously conspicuous dog boner.

It just seems so strange, since Leo’s always

grinning so manically.

I mean, I like driving and I like getting boners,
and I even like doing both on special occasions,
but obviously not nearly as much as he does.

The excitement in that station wagon would be
so explosive that, by the time we all made it to the
forest, even Jonathan and I would be filled with

- dog-like elation, and we’d all spill out of the car —‘

man and dog alike -—- in an Bacchanalia of sprint-
ing about insanely with our tongues out, defecating
in bushes, and assaulting any humans unlucky
enough to get caught in our path.

Over the course of several years — after pet-
ting the dog; having the dog jump on you in greet-
ing; having the dog stare intensely at your food;
watching the dog pounce on squirrels or birds that

_are already dead; having the dog lick your hand,

then putting your hand by your crotch, putting your
other hand on top of the dog’s head and pretending
he’s giving you blow -—- you come to love the dog.

And it’s weird to love a dog, since it’s not even
human, yet I ultimately find it a fulfilling relation-
ship — as fulfilling as that time I won the Boy
Scouts’ Pinewood Derby back in the third grade
and was finally accepted as more than just the eye-
patch kid.

Either way, Hunter, if you’re reading this, I do .

love you, and I genuinely hope you never end up in
a hamburger.

‘paper clips —— one for each boy they’d

kissed. Sitting down became a loud and

‘ attention—getting event. When I first

read this story, I thought it was ridicu-
lous  until I began to see similar,
attention—getting schemes masquerad-
ing as normality, both in my life and in
myself. . ,-

Last weekend,«\I went to see one of
my favorite bands play. As soon as I
opened the door to the club, I Walked
into a virtual mushroom cloud of ciga-
rette smoke and into another world.
Everyone there looked alike — both
boys and girls were dressed in tight,

« thrift-store clothes, had unisex haircuts,

and bore pins displaying the names and
symbols of bands. I felt surprisingly out
of place, despite knowing I shared at

’ least one interest with just about every-

one in the room — the band. Although
everyone there was genuinely nice to
me, I felt like we all knew I was some-
how intruding. I felt like rushing out to
get my hair cut and buy some pins with
band names on them -—- whether I knew
and liked the music or not — to accent

some interesting, thrift-store clothes

that would be creative in a way‘ that

doesn’t stray too far from the standard.

I had a jarring ﬂashback to eighth
grade, remembering when I spent an
entire month"s allowance on a plain,
white shirt S that said
“Abercro1nbie” across it in
plain, red text. I distinctly
remember picking that shirt
from many others that would
have been more comfortable
or attractive purely because I I
figured that its stark label
would secure status for me.

Through the blurry and
clouded edges of my contin-
uing ﬂashback, I recall the
day that the popular girls,
aptly named the “mall
chicks” by one of our teachers, all Wore
short, plaid skirts to school.

My peers and I became collectively
more excited than we had when we
heard the rumor that the kid who
always walked to classes with his hood
darkening his face had a stockpile of
pipe bombs in his basement targeted for
the school. Skirts were practically

unheard of then, and believe me — I ‘

would have known. And so comes the

part of the ﬂashback that is,unfortu-

nately, not as cloudy as I would like.
That same night, I spent over an

hour on the phone with my two best
friends, deciding which skirts we would
wear the. next day. Thankfully, memory
fails me beyond that.

While I was at the
show and feeling pressure
to conform to a stereotype
that differs from my
eighth grade aspiration,
yet is so much the same, I
caught myself and started
thinking. Two of my
friends were at the show
with me, whose names I
will change to protect the
questionable. Both were
wearing pins and had
short, dyed hair. To my
left stood Rosalyn, who I knew would
later rave about this band no matter
how insipid and uninspiring the perfor-
mance had been. She was sporting the
classic “Stop Racism Now” patch -—-
the same one she was displaying -the
time when I heard her making fun of a
mentally retarded girl.

. To my right stood Katie, someone I
hold in high regard. While she may fit
the scene we were in at the time, she’s
also the ruler of it — and of herself. If
everyone else disappeared,'Katie would
most likely still be in the same place,

looking at music and ideas objectively.
The bands and thoughts she displays on
pins and patches don’t fit into a neat,
standard, stereotypical package — they

’ are the things she likes and, if I am not

dishearteningly mistaken, actually
believes. Katie and Rosalyn show a dif-
ference that could be called religion —
Rosalyn has made everyone her god,
whereas Katie is only a subject to her-
self.

I saw such a deﬁnite difference in
Katie and Rosalyn that I knew I could-
n’t judge the whole lot of the concert-
goers like I wanted to — I couldn’t con-
demn the entire subculture just because
I wasn’t ﬁtting right in. That night, I
fought my own urges to perform for the
people I was surrounded by, even the
ones I knew I didn’t respect. I watch
myself doing this all the time — ﬁght-
ing to keep from performing. I still
don’t understand why it is so unnatural
to follow my instincts. It’s a battle I’m
very willing to ﬁght; right now, the
only power I want governing me is
myself.

As a young man, artist Henry Koemer
began a new life to, literally, save his life.
Koemer ﬂed his native Vienna in 1938,
months after Hitler’s annexation of Austria,
leaving his parents and older brother behind.
“The Early 1Work of Henry Koemer,” an
exhibit of Koerner’s work that recently
opened at The FrickArt & Historical Center,
follows the artist in his formative years in the
United States and conveys, through his
paintings, the trauma of his discovery that
only he survived his family’s destruction in

tive style with abstract elements often called I

“magic realism,” a post-war American style
inﬂuenced by European movements of the
time. In a catalog accompanying the exhibit,

. curator Edith Balas, an art history professor

atCMUandresearchassociateatPitt,
recounts Koemer’s early critical recognition
and success in the ‘40s with his ﬁrst solo
show in Berlin, aswell as his inclusion in the
Whitney Museum of American Art’s 1949
armual exhibition.

Trained as a commercial graphic artist

in Vienna, Koemer worked designing
posters in an illustration studio during the
late 1930s. After escaping to the United
States, Koemer found work in New York
City designing book covers for popular
detective ﬁction and mysteries. He won
awards for designs of World War H posters,
and, after being drafted into the U.S. Army
in 1943, Koemer designed works for-ﬂie

Even without Chong, bongs won’tbe gone for long

As my boyfriend was cooking dinner for the two
of us last Wednesday, I sat down to read that day’s
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A letter to the editor regard-
ing Tommy Chong’s recent, paraphemalia—related
arrest, his movies and our country’s Operation Pipe
Dreams ruined my appetite.

The person who wrote the letter actually found

comfort in the fact that, after Sept. 11, 2001, our
country has used its resources to wipe out drug para-
phemalia.

I don’t take comfort in that — it terriﬁes me.

At a time when national security should be our
highest priority, I find it disconcerting that our gov-
ernment is. devoting this amount of effort to seizing
bongs. V 7.

The writer of that letter also stated that our gov-
ernment should go a step further with the marijuana
nonsense and “seek out and silence every person who
knowingly watched the [‘Cheech & Chong’] films.”

Have I accidentally taken LSD and tripped
myself into George Orwell’s “1984?” Does this mean
that movies depicting bank robberies and drive-by
shootings should also be banned? Does it mean that
“That ‘70s Show” — which, before all of this crap,
Chong guest starred on -— should go off of the air
because Kelso and pals regularly sit in the Forrnan’s
basement to light up? Maybe the hilarious Cheech &
Chong smoked real cheeba-cheeba onscreen, maybe

they didn’t. Who cares? That was 30
years ago. ' _ .

Locking up Chong isn’t going to solve America’s
“marijuana problem.” Nor will raiding Tela Ropa and
snatching glass pieces.

' What about the millions of people who already
own paraphernalia? Do the higher powers realize
that it is possible to smoke pot out of an apple, a pop
can, a piece of aluminum foil or a plastic, two-liter
bottle and a tub of water? ~

Perhaps the next step for Operation Pipe Dreams
is to raid major supermarkets and rid them of their

      

apples. That is not cool — apples are quite nutri-
tious and tasty. ‘

You can smoke pot in Canada and Amsterdam;

some states allow it to be used for medicinal purpos-

es. Of course, those ridiculous TV ads — you may ‘

have seen them — tell us that money spent on drugs
ends up funding terrorism. I don’t buy it, but if it
were true, why not legalize? Then the money would
come to ‘us. And, perhaps more importantly, drugs
would be carefully regulated, creating a situation-

, like that in Amsterdam, where you can be sure that
the ganja you are smoking isn’t laced with harder,

drugs. I - -

With Chong locked up, people are going to raise
torches _—- read: bongs, bowls, and joints — tovhim in
tribute to_ his comedic antics as well as his online
head shop. There are far more dangerous drugs avail-.
able to teenagers than pot. According to a story that
-ran on news channel KDKA in December of last
year, marijuana use among teens has declined, while
their use of heroin and cocaine has remained steady.
It’s pretty hard to overdose on pot, but heroin and
cocaine can easily do you in. So hey, let’s lock up
“Tommy Chong! 9 I V . A

While-«we are a long, long way from legalizing
the least harmful -recreational drug — keep in mind
that alcohol is a drug .— America needs to spend its
time and money on more useful causes.

THE PITT NEWS

Koerner continued from page 6

Germany to document in illustrations the
Nuremberg trials. Some of his sketches of
the Nazi war criminals are included in the
exhibit. While in Europe, Koemer returned
to Vienna to learn the fate of his family from
a former neighbor. This painful realization
left a permanent impact on his work and his
life. For years afterward, Koemer would
return annually to Vienna, seeking subjects
for his work

Koemer’s painting style is rooted in his
illustrative technique. In part, his studies and
ﬁnished paintings reveal careful attention to
realistic representation of his subjects. But
Koemer’s artistic statements come out in
composition — he radically distorts a scene
or the features of faces, juxtaposes incongru-
ous scenery, modulates the scale of elements
and eliminates the shadows that would
obscure his concepts. This is the point where
his realism becomes “magic.”

In “My Parents no. 2,” painted in 1946
after his retum to Vienna, Koemer resurrects
his parents, depicting them visiting a forest
outside the city. The textures of the trees and
light—dappled, fallen, gold leaves are meticu-
lously captured, but the power of the art is in
its symbolic composition: faﬂier and mother
are posed away from the viewer, departing
from this world. A locket bearing a child-
hood photograph of the artist and his broth-

er, Kurt, is shown abandoned on a tree, -

“where,” according to Koemer’s commen-
tary, “their way parted.”
Kurt is the subject of a later painting,

“My Brother,” that Koemer painted in oils
following two years of study in watercolor.
The style is a signiﬁcant departure from his
previous realistic works, owing to the inﬂu-
ence of Cezanne, whose works guided
Koemer in watercolor technique. In “My
Brother,” the subject is painted twice, ﬁrst as
a numbered, black-and-white photograph
that represents Kurt as a victim of Nazi
extermination, and again as a James Dean-
style, 1950s teenager, resurrected according
to Koemer’s memory. This is a lurriinous
work in wide strokes of complementary
peach and aqua green. Koemer juxtaposed
the colors to create impressions of light and
contour.

After the n1id—‘50s, when abstract-

expressionism rose rapidly in the opinions of
critics in New York, then the new center of
the art world, Koemer continued to interpret
and incorporate his observations from the
world around him into his artistic visions of
loss, remembrance, urban alienation and
hope for the rest of his life, creating and
reﬁning a highly symbolic, yet accessible,
oeuvre.  I

Perhaps Koemer’s dichotomous lan-
guage of hypeirealism and distortion better
expresses the contradiction of the intellectu-
al progress and moral decline that character-
ized the 20th century. The artist’s tableaux
appear crystal—clear, yet unfathomable.

“The Early Works of Henry Koemer” runs
concurrently with “Hoka—Neni.' Seven paint-
ings by Valentin Lustig, ” an artist born to
survivors of the Holocaust.

It Still Moves

My Morning Jacket
ATO/RCA Records
i‘n1‘m“r1/2

My Morning J acket’s love of reverb
might be compared to the love a fat, fat
man might have for mayonnaise: They
dip, slather, stir and smother everything
with it, slowly drowning their sweet,
country-twang guitars in a bucket of it.

I In fact, the early years of the
Louisville, Ky., band found front man
Jim James and company exploiting
neighborhood barns in search of the
deepest, sharpest echoes — an act that
undoubtedly contributed to the band’s
dense sound today —- that and a firm,
genuine affinity for “The Muppets.”

It Still Moves, the band’s first effort
on Dave Matthews’ ATO Records, is a
drifting beauty of an album. Guitars
wrap themselves around each other, giv-
ing way to an onslaught of pianos, horns
and echoing melodies, only to be met
again with unapologetically lengthy
guitar solos. Everything gets lost in
something else, all without losing the
punch.

  Don’t forget this jacket

On the opening “Mahgeetah,”
James is ‘fall wrapped up in a bottle of
wine,” while crooning, ‘.‘people always
told me/bars are dark and lonely,” on
“Golden.” James’ relationship with
alcohol becomes a poetic pillar on Still;

Elsewhere, James admits “It wasn’t
until I woke up that I could hold down a
joke or a job or a drearn/But then, all
three are one in the same,” and pleads,
“Just don’t make it last any longer than
it has to,” with his words rolling off of
his tongue with both the conﬁdence of a
happy artistand the half-consciousness
of a drunk at 3 a.m.

Despite the fact that a handful of
these songs clock in at about 7 minutes,
none of them seem to “last any longer”
than they have to, because the band’s
sharp but dark melodies tastefully
mutate into sleepwalking soundtracks
before the coffee is finished brewing.

Still wouldn’t be nearly as fun to lis-
ten to, either, if it wasn’t as clear as it is
that these guys are enjoying themselves,
too. As bummed out and drunk as they
may be, My Morning Jacket still has
rock ‘n’ roll, and they like it.

Rockets blast No.
Pitt out of Toledo in
comeback victory

MATT SORTINO
Staff Writer

TOLEDO, Ohio— Toledo quarterback
Bruce Gradkowski was determined
to make Pitt’s first trip to the Glass
Bowl one to remember. 9

And did he ever. The sophomore
Pittsburgh native completed 49 of 62
passes for 461 yards and three
touchdowns to lead. the Toledo
Rockets in a 35-31 win over the”’No.
9 Pitt Panthers Saturday night.

Gradkowski set single-game
school records for completions,
attempts and yards while throwing
only one interception and coughing
up one fumble, in just his fourth
career start. His 49 completions
were also i a Mid-American
Conference record.

With'43 seconds remaining 

the game and the Rockets trailing
31-28, Gradkowski threw a fade
pass over Pitt cornerback Shawntae
Spencer into the hands of wide
receiver‘ Lance Moore for the win-
ning touchdown, capping a 15-play,
83-yard drive. .. .
Throughout the game, Moore
evolved as Gradkowski’s favorite

target, catching a school-record '15 -

passes for 162 yards and two -touch-‘
downs. . ’ .

The Panthers’ defense never had '-
the right answer for the Rocket

attack, which included a barrage of
different, short passes, mostly in the
ﬂat, combined with a no-huddle,
hurry-up offense.

Pitt forced two turnovers, an

interception by linebacker Malcolm A

Postell, which he returned 54 yards,
setting up tight end Kris Wilson’s
second touchdown catch of the day,
and a fumble recovery by redshirt
freshman linebacker Brian Bennett,
the first of his career.

“Gradkowski did a fabulous job,
and their receivers caught every-
thing,” Walt Harris said. “They had
a great game plan and executed
everything tremendously. They did a
lot of things we hadn’t seen before
and didn’t prepare for, so that is a
tremendous credit to the way they
executed.”

Quarterback Rod Rutherford led
the Panthers’ offensi-ve attack, which
racked up 389 yards of total offense

and scored 24 points in the first half. --

Rutherford completed 24 of 36 pass-
es for 315 yards, four touchdowns
and two interceptions. Rutherford
had thrown ll‘ touchdown passes
this season before throwing his first
interception.

Rugby impresses in Division 1 competition

If you spent the last three weeks wondering
what a serum is, who’s a hooker, or why a suc-
cessful scoring attempt is‘ called a try, ,you were
probably watching the men’s rugby team.

And if you weren’t, you missed out.

The Pitt men’s rugby team opened its season
with four straight victories, most notably defeat-
ing Indiana University of Pennsylvania, one of the

. nation’s top teams, according to head coach Dan

5 Talbert.

The season began for the Panthers with a 56-0
win over Franciscan. Pitt’s B-Team'also picked up
a‘ win against Franciscan, one the road.
Franciscan?s C-Team, however, defeated the
Panthers 18-0. ‘ ' ‘

On Sept. 13, Pitt played two home games,
handily defeating Clarion. 59-0 in the first game.
Following the victory, the Panthers turned their
sights toward IUP. 3

“Knowing we’d need some rested guys_

against IUP, we sat seven of 15 starters against

Clarion,” Talbert stated“ in an e-mail to rugby
alumni.. ‘°- A -

IUP opened the match against the Panthers
with a 3-point penalty kick. Pitt tied the game at
three.—when_Je'ff Shellenberger hit the first of his
three penalty kicks for the Panthers. °

. Talbert dubbed Shellenberger the Man of the
Match for his “clutch penalty kicks” and ability to
keep IUP’s fullback in check. ‘

down. For the second game in a row,
Fitzgerald broke his own school
record for consecutive games with a
touchdown — he now has nine
games with a touchdown —— and fin-
ished the game with_more than 200
yards receiving for the first time
even

He became the first Panthers’
receiver to do the latter since
Antonio Bryant did it against North
Carolina in 2000, with 212 yards.
Wilson caught three balls, all touch-
downs, for 30 yards, and running
back Brandon Miree gained 62
yards on 20 rushing attempts.

Pitt was bit by the injury bug
before the game and was forced to
really juggle their offensive line.
Guards Matt Maiers and John
Simonitis each made their first start
of the season, and Jon Schall was
forced to make his first career start
at center.

The changes didn’t seem to
affect the Panthers’ running game in
the first half; Miree gained 54 yards
on just 12 carries. But the second
half was a different story — the

Panthers all but abandoned the run-
ning game in favor of the air attack.

On the first drive of the second
half; trailing the Panthers 24-14, the
Rockets marched 82 yards. on 14
plays, capping it off with an 11-yard
touchdown pass from Gradkowski
to wide receiver Trinity Dawson.

The key play was a fourth-down
conversion, which was the Rockets’
second successful fourth-down con-
version of the game. On fourth—and-
two from their own 38-yard line,
Gradkowski hit tight end Andrew
Clarke for a 13-yard gain to keep
the drive going. '

Each team scored another touch-
down before the Rockets scored the
eventual game-winning touchdown.

The Panthers are the highest
ranked team that Toledo has defeat-
ed. Coming into the game, the
Panthers were 21-0 against teams
from the MAC.‘ '

After the game, a teary-eyed
Gradkowski struggled for words to
describe the Rockets’ big win.

“I’m so pumped about this team
that words can’t express what I feel
right now. -If you believe in yourself,
there is no telling what can happen.”

Rugby beats IUP in Div. I play

Rugby, page 9

with Scott Derrig picking up a try
off of a run to the 3-yard line by
Brad DiCola.

_ Shellenberger kicked:;,..the two-
point conversion to make the score
10-3 at the half. A . __ 

In the second half,‘ IUP‘ scored
two tries butmissed both conver-
sions. In between the IUP scores,
Shellenberger put in~'.his.. second
penalty kick. ~

Talbert said that although IUP
had a reputation for having strong
backs, they didn’t get much through
Pitt’s defense. “Their backs were
supposed to be their strength, but
ours looked better on offense and
held them to all but a couple of
inside runs on defense.”

With the score tied at 13 ‘and one
minute ‘left in the game,

‘ success

Disappointed with No. 9 Pitt’s 35-31
loss to unranked Toledo?

Shellenberger kicked his final penal-
ty kick of the game to propel the
Panthers to a 16-13 win.

“We talked a lot about finding
out what defense they run early on,‘

thentrying to use it against them,”

Talbert said.

“This was easily the most grati-
fying win for [me] gas a. coach,”
Talbert said. “[Flyback Brian
Shamus] called a terrific game, and
his kicking got us out of ‘a lot of
jams. [He] lulled them to sleep [by]
going wide play after play in the
first half.” A .

The Panthers continued their
with a 68-0 win over
Pittsburgh—Johnstown, scoring 10
tries in the match. Pitt’s B—Team also
won, 19-7. 1

The Panthers are next in action
at home on Sept. 27, against West
