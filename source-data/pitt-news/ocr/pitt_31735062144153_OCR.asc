ICG Delegate
Rot        to Pitt  

Forty Pitt’ delegates to the In-
tercoilegiate‘ Conference on Gov-
ernment Model Congress session

 

'lield.?*in Harrisburg last week ar-

ri.ved“:‘baick on» campus Sunday
evening.

The? Pitt delegation was the
largest‘ of the 3-5* Peniisylvania

scliools . represented. Besides this

sev‘e,ra'i« other honors were Pitt"s.
Paiul’ Simmons was elected chair-
man? of the Rules Committee, the
governing body of the conference,
while‘ Lester Rubenstein served as
chairman of -the Military Affairs
com'5m‘itt‘ee. Pitt also had the dis-
tin.ct_'ion of having 29 of the 30
bills’? that they sent to the con-
clave passed; Among ‘them a bill
to provide for a fair employment
practice commission was carried.

This FEPC bill would prohibit‘.

race-vcolor-creed discrimination;

Pitt?s
Bill. of Rights to assure similar
educational beneﬁts. to the chil-
dren of the world war dead was
carried by a unanimous vote.

Perhaps the most noteworthy
piece of legislation was that on the
control of atomic energy. The
Model Congress passed a bill giv-
ing control of atomic energy to a
civilian commission presided over
by the President. Internationally,
atomic control was placed in the
hands of the‘ UNO, to which the
ICG, pledged wholehearted’ sup-
port

O-ﬂi-cers for the coming year
were named at an executive meet-
ing. They include Miss Genevieve
Blatt as executive‘ director, in
which capacity she has served for
the past ten years, and Till-ie
Sanker, puiblicity director.

amendment to the GI"

, versity at the annual nominee’s

Monday was April Fool’s
Day, so just to be different, we
are celebrating today. The in-
side pages contain what must.
pass for humor here until-
something funnier comes along.
We hope you will enjoy our
various squibs, scribblings, and

,what have you? Any resem-
blance to any walking and

intentional and subleties mean
just what you seelbetween the
lines. Oh, well, the staff‘ had
fun anyway.

In.-a recent issue of the Pittsburgli Press, Editor Edward T.
Leech wrote that Pittsburgh had more than griine, smoke, and
dirt t-O‘0fl.’e1‘. its citizens. To quote, “it (Pittsburgh) offcifs un-
usual educational, recreational, and cultural ‘facilities. The
trouble is that outsiders have heard too little about these ad-
vantages, and too much about our handicaps.”

For purposes of this editorial let us narrow the subject to
that of our own University. The above statement is applicable
to the situation here at Pitt. " ‘For instance, in some cases to
even mention that you attend ‘the University brings sarcastic
sneers and digs~—“Oh, got a scholarship,” or “Coul.dn’t get in
anywhere else.” This blandness of some of the so-called civic-
minded citizens of Pittsburgh‘isﬁrritating, but more so,‘ tlie fact
ttliat even students make a joke lout of their attendzincc at Pitt,
is ‘cl.’ source of aggravation to the more loyal-mlndccl students.

\Ve know that in the past __the University has not been on
the best of terms with the “outs'i(le,” including the press. Per-
haps, (:()l1lL1'll)lll;ll1g' to this dissention is a prime factor‘-—the foot-
ball sitnation. E.spccia.l].y since the dc-emphasis of the grid
sport there hasbcen a constant,ha-rangiiig and lack of coopera-
tion between some of the administrative ofﬁcials and the down-
town scribes. However, we note with approval the lIl3.l“l{€.’£l l.lll-
provenient jtliat has come about‘ with the advent of the recent
selection of -a, newcoach and enthusiastic plans for spring ti'2iin-
ing. It gives us a hopeful outlook for better zicceptziilicc of Pitt.

W lThei'e are ‘other sigiis, too, that express tho pi‘og'ii'cssivoncss
of our school and which we may use to zulvantugc to break down
I'_esent—=Ii1eIi‘t. * ,- I -

 Pitt’s agenda of educational facilities is llllllllll'l‘()(l and in
this postwar era. has expanded; greatly. New siibjccts such as
avi2it.ion, iiavlgatioii, and cl.cct._if.icity l'l‘d.V() bccnaddcd to moot
the ciirrciit trend towards t(l(3'1ll/ll(i‘,al iiiftcrcsts. Tl"E.lllS[)()l"l£l.llOl’l
and advertising courses in the .bij1sincs.s ﬁeld have taken on new
importance. A number of outlets for cultural tmiiiing arc
ava.i1ab'lc in the ﬁne arts and lib,c1'al. arts departments.

Scholastic requirements wi'llmatui'a].ly gain more pertl‘._i_ncncc
with  increased (30lIl'p€tll3l0l1:2lll"lOl1g students, thus, setting‘ at
new high in educational acliicvcmeiit. Also origiiiality and cro-
ativencss will show themselves througli the rebirth of a lively
actlvitties program on campus. ' P

come this resentment by the subtle propag'ai.idiziiig of l1igl1-c2:ili-

“comic” strips, 9.25 per cent.
Questions which students asked

the 265 persons who represent a

good cross-section of society were:

’What percentage of the average

newspaper do you think is devoted
to sports news—to cri.me———and to
comics‘? People from all walks of
life were interviewed. House-
wives, college students, college
professors, models, lawyers, a
street car motorman, artists, min-
isters, a funeral director, a bar-
tender, teachers, a librarian, a
child psychologist, social workers,
office clerks, and research scientists
were among those interviewed.
"An actual study of 24‘ issues of
Pittsburgh daily newspapers re-
vealed an average of 4.5 per cent
for sports; 2.75 for crime; and 3.75
for “comics.” Compare these cal-
culations of ‘-the percentage -of

texecutives ran a close second to

the professors‘with a 6.73. College
students guessed 8.79 per cent. On
the ‘whole, the women made the
closest guess of 6.6 per cent against
the men’s 9.8 per cent. ,

But the women went hog-wild
on crime, giving it 20.8 per cent
of the newspapers’ space. The
men weren’t too far behind with
an estimate of 18.5 per cent. Col-
lege students estimated 18.2 per

walked away with the honors,

against the actual 2.75 per cent.

The engineers came closest on

Du Pont chemists began a study of

two years...ha‘d succeeded in forming

polyesters with molecula

ing one of these “superpolymers” from
the molecular still, one of the chemists
noted that it could be drawn out into a
. thin strand, like taﬁ'y candy. But, un-
 like taﬁ'y,ii“t”w21s not brittle when cooled.

further drawn out to se

came not stronger but elastic!

This original-ester polymer had a low
melting potpt and was sensitive _to water.
N evertheléss, it s_uggeste,d.t,hat some re-
lated type.,of polymer might produce
ﬁbers which would be of practical use

in textiles.

Numerous superpolymers were syn-
thesized and tested. Finally, in 1935, a
polyamide was prepared. From it, the
ﬁrst nylon ﬁlaments were made-—by
forcing the, molten polymer through a

hypodermic needle!

way had a‘1ittle trouble withthe
treasurer but with his cow-like
stare, he was certiﬁed as a.gov-
ernment student in good standing.

Hathaway’s success was phe-
nomenal. He was pledged to three
fraternities, acted as chairman of
the War Bond drive andshad a
straight “A” average. There .must
be some fundamental reason for
such accomplishments, but we are
inclined to credit Hathaway’s
adaptability for the results. ¢He
had such an air of nonchala-nce.
Take the way he handled the Tuck
Shop episode. ,

One day he sidled quite by ac-
cident, into the Kappa booth. Of

tunity to ﬁnish his fourteenth coke,
some one questioned his right» to
be there. ‘ Hathaway ‘ looked
_as.kance——then with a bull like roar
he‘ plunged from the booth, knock-

activity was hardly noticed in the

say, quite. coherently, such clever

-way found that he was accepted as
a sparkling conversationalist upon
:the injectio.n~of like phrases into

One fateful day the Veterans

his conviction that he was the lot

Snorter Board,’ honorary society
for active wome_n,.-will present il-

cappees on April 31 which has
been designated as Cap day. Ac-
cording to Sophia Drool, president,
the purpose. of this annual cere-
mony is to give recognition to those
who have been most active on
campus during the past year.

Sele.ctions are based on: (1) the-

number of dates on school nights

_ divided by the square root of the

number of classes cut, (2) num-
ber of veterans corraled during
registration, and (3) the average
number of Tuck shop booths sat
in per day.

Miss Drool said, “These women
are maintaining deﬁnite standards
which deserve recognition. In ad-
dition to the capping, the annual
Smooching Award will be pre-
sented to the girl who is voted the
most “lovable” on campus. The
recipient of this award will have
her name and phone number
chalked all over the Back Road in

“My name is McCann, yours is

“You take it and -I knock your

teeth «down that long undergradu-

Seeing that Yes was in a light

yay mood we manter-ed, “lVIr. Ges-
ler, you were some shucks as a
football player, nest pos?”

“Some is-hucks—hm'ph! I was

.Ges modestly replied, “but that

was only because I was the best

-d--m end in the country,” he add-

ed reluctantly. Seeking a new
tack, this writer mentioned scho-
lastic achievement. In a voice
quivering with emotion, Gesler
answered, “Only one _thing beside
dirty rotten politics kept me out
of Phi Beta Kappa and that was
my grades.”

Seeing that we were o-n touchy
subject, diplomatically, the trend
of the interview was shifted. “Do

Mr. Gesler?”

“Listen, son, right now .I’d strive

the boys to feel that in the Ath-

“But about next year, you ex-
pect to win more games than

dicating that , any number over
three would do the triclz.)

“Wall now, I don’t know——m_ay-
be if we con book Vassar, Smith,

equalled. but that Suil-ins first
._team has quite a line. in tact the
lines at Smith and Vassar arenlt
bad,” he reflected mistiy, as l
detectedsa slight amount or drool
on the Geslerian countenance.

“Listen, lVIr. Gesler (neglecting
the informal address and being
knocked across three adding ma-
chines for our lack of friendli-
ness) tell me something, about
your coaching methods,” recalling
vaguely a line of Shakespeare that
mentioned methods somehow con-
nected with madness.

“I don’t want you to feel that
I’m infringing on prior theories,”
Ges ‘began, waving a meat clever
above our head and toying with
the safety catch of a ’45.

“Of course -not,”

Is There

A Lemon
In the House?

Women’s Screech association,
under the able direction of Miss
Ho-Hawm, has announced its

latest university campaign to be
that of the “Lemons for the Com-
mons Room Fund.”

“We have felt for quite some
time,” said Miss Ho-Hawm. “Be-
sides feeling, we are absolutely
sure that this effort to provide
lemons for the Commons Room
will ﬁll a very great need in cam-
pus life.” I

“It has, moreover, repeatedly
come to our attention that students
would gladly do without sugar,
hostesses, or even samovars, but
lemons are vitally essential to stu-
dent, wellbeing and morale.”

“For these very excellent rea-
sons,” continued Miss Ho-Hawm,
“We have instituted our little
campaign for an increased lemon
supply. We are asking each stu-
dent on campus to bring in at
least one lemon, and those who
have fathers in the wholesale bus-
iness may be able to bring in even
more.” .

“Each organization, too, will be
asked to cooperate by'donating at
least one quart‘ of lemon juice,
preferably of the pure or undis-
tilled variety. In this way we feel
that everyone will have an ade-
quate supply of Vitamin C, and
the campaign will undoubtedly go
over with a big SSSHHT.”

Complete Spring IM
Program Scheduled

By Saul Osgood
Outliniiigwthe intramural sports program to ‘a group of men rep-
resenting the student body and faculty, Carl Olson, IM sports director,
explained the next _group of events to be held through the end of the

term. 9

Ironing out the problems which
had arisen in the basketball tourn-
ment, Mr. Olson said that the
next IM program will be let en-
tirely up to the student body.”

The next tournament to be held
is the lM—IF Softball League,
«scheduled to start April 8 and
continuing through till May 15th.

‘The fraternities will have a
two—league contest, consisting of
ﬁve teams in each league, and the
Dents will combine with the
School of Medicine and the
School of Pharmacy to form two-
four-team leagues. The Bus Ads
and the College will have one
four-team league each, and the
Engineers will have two four-team
leagues.

Mr. Olson hopes to have three
ﬁelds available and probably a
fourth by the time league play
starts. The ﬁelds now available
are the three diamonds around
Tree gymnasium, and perhaps the
Shadyside ﬁeld.

A team entered into a league
will play the other teams in that
league twice, and the team ending
up in first place will compete with
the winners of the other league-s
in a round-robin elimination con-
test.

Each team is limited to only 15
players, and a man can play on
only one team. A team that for-
feits twice will automatically be
cancelled from league play to
make room for another team that
desires to play. Trophies and

medals will be given the winners
of every tournament.

A wrestling tournament will be
held. the ﬁrst week in May. All
men interested are asked to come
to Trees gym any time after 4
p. In. during the week and get
instructions from Mr. George E.
Vfeeks, University boxing and
wrestling instructor.

A swimming meet will be held

on the last Saturday in April. In-
dividual swimmers will represent
their se-parate schools or fraterni-
ties.
' A track and ﬁel-d meet will be
held on May 8. The same organ-
ization applies to this meet as the
swimming meet.

Here is some good news for golf
and tennis players. The golf links
and the tennis courts at Schenley
park have been acquired for those
students interested, through ar-
rangements made by Mr. Olson
and the Bureau of Parks and Rec-
reation. This is just for those men
and women students and faculty
interested in forming intramural
and intra—frat teams, There will
be no cost for participants.

Women are invited to compete
alongwith the men in the golf
and tennis matches. No date has
been set for these tournaments
as yet.

For all those interested in com-
peting in any of these sports, get
in touch with any of the follow-
ing men in your school and they

‘Decision Surprises  
Conference Members

By A. Roomer .
The University of Pittsburgh-—which has been standing in foot-
bal.l’s bread line for seven years-—went back on sports’ gold standard

today with its acceptance into the high-powered Western Conference.
Coming from an unimpeachable source in Chicago, the announce-

welcome the Panthers into the fold
was a unanimous one.

Thus, Pitt succeeds Chicago’s
abdicated Maroons in a move
which has been in the rumor fac-
tory more often than Fritzie Ziv-
ic’s retirement.

Pitt officials had no immediate
comment on the decision, which
virtually assure the fact that the
Panthers’ hierarchy will abandon
its schoolboy attempts to demob-
ilize athletics. -

The Blue and Gold’s ﬁrst Big
10 appearance will probably be‘
in the conference outdoor track
championships this summer. Base-
ball is out of the picture until
1947, with schedules already ﬁlled
for the most part. L

‘The grid outlook is much bright-
er.  A

Pitt presently has four big 10
foes on its schedule——Oh.io State,
Indiana (1945 titlist), Illionis and
Purdue. There is one permanently
open date which could well be

).-It’s Wonderful

By Teddy Termite
erchrauns to cle  up between

age of fu-migating '-equipment, we
want to ask a favor, of you cam-
pus Janes and Joes. It all hinges
around the fact that warm weath-
er is practicaly here, and it goes
without saying that you all fully
realized how -densely populated
this schoolhouse isat present.

So, us folks—the deans, the pro-
fessors, and I would like it very
inuch if you would all set out to
orove to the world at large the
road to success is "paved with co-
wperation. See, like smokers
md we like non-smokers, and we
especially like theip -‘in their pro-
per places. Similaily, we don’t
mind -a bit if you consume or nib-
ble your way throu ‘h as much as
ten tons of candy}. ears a week.
But--’PLEASE—d"‘ ‘t make our
fastidiously n1anicue»i'/d lawn 1-ook
like the horrible af; ermath of a
technicolored snovvjfgll.

That’s the favor uve want to ask
of you and We sure hope you’ll do
it for us. "Cause if  do-—wel1,
wh-o knows, vi/4,, might still get
through.‘ this semqster without los-
ing what's left our minds at
