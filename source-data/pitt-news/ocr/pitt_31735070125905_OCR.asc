Rainbow hosts a
night of ‘Queer Art’

LEE ANNE HUTCHISON
The Pitt News

9 Sporting a full beard, men’s
jeans and a T—shirt, Jake Arthur
looks like your “average Jake.”

But underneath these clothes
and beard is a ‘former lesbian, a
genetically born female with a man
inside screaming to get out.

After two years of hormone
treatments, Arthur, a supporter of
Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance, slowly
transformed physically into the man

-he felt he was.

But to him, it wasn’t about the
hormones, beard or deepened voice.

“It’s about who you are inside,”
Arthur said, “not about how your
body manifests.”

Arthur, along
with several oth-
ers, displayed
his art at the

works left little room for the imagi-
nation, transposing every crease,
fold and hair.

Also showcased were pho-

including one by junior Rainbow

of a “Philly Gayborhood.” ,

As a user and
supporter of hor-

Arthur’s art
depicts an unex-

In one dis-

male doll is crucified and syringes
tack his hands and feet to a cross,
mocking the worship of “hormones
as God.”

According to Arthur, too much

‘emphasis is placed on hormone

sion of a person’s gender and not
enough on how the person internal-
izes it. ~ ‘ .,

Police unsure whether campus
evacuation was a good idea

tion,” Hill said. V

Michele Grifﬁth, a residence direc-
tor. from Bruce Hall, said the evacuation
of her building proceeded smoothly.
Grifﬁth said RDs are trained in crowd
control and general evacuation proce-
dures.

Laura Kibler, a sophomore who
lives in Bruce Hall, described a less-
coordinated evacuation effort.

Kibler she said she heard shouting

on the street as police officers yelled for
those being evacuated to “run as far
down Forbes as possible.”

Kibler said friends called from

0 another room to tell her that the police

had evacuated the Union. From the
window of her siXth—ﬂoor room over-
looking Forbes Avenue, she and her
roommate saw that police had posi-
tioned themselves. up and down the

1 street.

‘ Concerned for her safety after hear-
ing from another friend that it was a
bomb threat, Kibler called out her win-
dow to a police ofﬁcer below.

“‘What’s going on?’ I said. But he
wouldn’t really tell us,” Kibler‘ said.
“We asked if we were safe. But .- [the
police ofﬁcer] just said we were OK
where we were for now.” ,

But Kibler said two minutes later
the fire alarm sounded. She then found
herself waiting for information with
more than 100 other students near the

‘ intersection of Fifth and Oakland

avenues.

Even as fire-alarm alert lights con-
tinued to ﬂash across the windows of
Brackenridge, the residence halls
reopened at approximately 10:30 p.m.

A Kibler said that when she returned
to ‘her building a little more than an
hour later, a police ofﬁcer told her that
the building was not supposed to have
been evacuated.

“[The police] ofﬁcer said it was

‘ probably a nervous cop who pulled the

fire alarm,” Kibler said. .

‘A residence‘ hall security guard,
who asked to remain anonymous for
‘fear of losing her job, confirmed that a
Pitt police ofﬁcer activated the alarm
that forced the evacuation of one of the

, buildings in Schenley Quadrangle.

Brackney said city police believed

students were safer in their rooms and.

that they should most likely have stayed
in their residence halls. '
“There may -have been some mis-
communication,” she said. “And [those
who evacuated the buildings] weren’t
sure of what the procedures would be.”
Hill said he was uncertain about the
total number of students affected by the
evacuation, but said that between

_ homecoming activities and students

studying in the library, “The full life of
campus was going on.”

Although police did not identify a
biological threat, Brackney said the
criminal investigation will continue.
Police have taken ﬁngerprints from one
of the payphones used to make the
threat and will compare the ﬁngerprints
to those in the fingerprint database.

Brackney urged everyone to take
terrorist threats seriously and calmly.

“There are a lot of people who
would capitalize on our fears,” she said.
“But we need to remain calm.”

see all the Pitt pride that’s been lacking
from students nowadays,” John Martin
said, a sophomore and member of the
Blue and Gold Society.

Adam Fossi, who is also a member of
the Blue and Gold Society and a Pitt
Pathﬁnder, was also impressed with the
school spirit of the alumni.

“You get to meet a lot of good people
and they all share their memories about
Pitt. It’s good to see so much pride in the
University,” he said. “One woman I met
that was an alumni was a part of the class

' of 1928. She is 94 years old. She told us

about buying bricks for the Cathedral for
10 cents a piece. I was shocked.”

Mimi Koral, director of alumni com-
munication, said, “The best thing that we
oﬁer for our alumni is for alumni to con-
nect with students and keep in contact
with their alrna mater.”

Many of the returning alumni came '

sporting Pitt garb and a smile.

“I’m glad to see all the young peo-
ple,” said Alan Garﬁnkel, general council
of the University and Pitt alumnus. “It

keeps me young. The students seem“

brighter than ever. It’s wonderful to be
connected to a University that’s doing

‘ such wonderful things.”

PERSPECTIVES

EDITORIAL

Coming home to an
anthrax scare

It’s amazing the powerful effect one
person’s actions can have.

City 911 dispatchers received a call
Saturday night from someone identifying
himself as Ali Moharrirned, saying that
anthrax would be released into William

Pitt Union in 10 minutes. Fifteen minutes‘

later, presumably the same person made
the same threat for Hillman Library.

As a result, Pitt and city police evac-
uated much of lower campus, including
several residence halls and the Union, for
two hours — all because of one person’s
actions.

Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11,
our country has found itself on high alert
for the possibility of biological terrorism.
In the last two weeks, this alert increased
because of conﬁrmed anthrax exposures
in Boca Raton, Fla., and New York City.

While these and a package sent to
Microsoft that tested positive for anthrax
are currently ’ the only confirmed inci-
dences of this disease in the United States
right now, several other scares have
occurred across the country. For example,
authorities here evacuated the Federal
Building Downtown last week.

Although armoying, prank calls are
harmless. But it’s another matter entirely
to call 911, say that anthrax is about to be

released into a crowded area and force

the evacuation of thousands.

The country is already on edge, and
this prarikster took advantage of that. He
can — and should — face up to ﬁve years
in prison for making these threats. People
are scared. Anthrax is a frightening dis-
ease, and no one should play on that fact.
It simply isn’t funny.

Such false alarms shake peop1e’s
sense of security and create unnecessary
panic. Police must take all threats seri-
ously. This person or people who called
in the anthrax threat realized that news
and rumors of such events spread quick-
ly. The district attomey’s ofﬁce should
prosecute the culprits to the fullest extent
of the law.

Saturday riight’s evacuations show
the necessity of having a well—coordinat-
ed emergency response plan for the
University. According to witnesses, Pitt
and city police gave mixed instructions to
those they evacuated and also bickered
over how to handle the situation. If the

threat were real, the two police depart— '

ments would have no time for ﬁghting.

The two police forces should dissem-
inate both consistent and correct informa-
tion to anyone ‘who needs it, quickly.
When lives are at risk, people have no
time to ﬁgure out whose directions to fol-
low.

Want a certiﬁcate in overachiever studies?

The University has recently
decided, because of an apparent
increase in spare time, to further chal-
lenge a certain group of students. This
group considers sleep

and never-ending amounts of work,

gious—sounding campus opportunities

are among the University’s

most driven students, as well as those
most likely to have a heart attack
before age 40.

We have created the department
of overachiever studies for these stu-
dents. Overachieving can give stu-
dents a theoretical understanding of
the world so specific that it will hold
no meaning to anyone, and the stu-
dents will be too busy to ever actually
explain it. Students in this department
learn to think critically about five

subjects at once while jealously won-..

dering if someone else is thinking of
six.

The department is committed to
providing overachievers with large

Please visit our Web
site, www.pitt.edu/~showoff, for
more information on the department
of overachiever studies or to take our
quiz, “Are you an overachiever?”

studies certificate . . ,
After three years of intense debate
among our most overworked profes-
sors, a certificate program has been
‘designated. To qualify, a student must
have a double major or a major and at
least two minors. Additionally, he or
-she must be an active member of four
or more extracurricular organizations.
To receive a certificate in over-
achiever studies, students must main-

lobbying groups and most _

tain an overall 3.5 QPA and a 3.75

I QPA within the department.

Students must take a minimum of
30 credits of overachiever-related
courses. While many of these will be
from other departments, we hope to
introduce specific overachiever stud-—
ies courses by next term.

The courses must be distributed
as follows:

0 One lower-level course with a
distinguishing name that is taught like
a graduate course. Consider courses
such as Introduction to Modern
Theory on_ the Space-Time
Continuum or. Reading Critical
Thought on Obscure Radical Writers

during the French and Indian War.

- Eight upper-level courses
including one language conversation,
one third world history, one political
science course focusing on Marxist
interpretations of the political econo-
m'y of Denmark, Theoretical Calculus
and Geometry for after the
Apocalypse, and four other courses
that sound suitably distinguished to
be chosen in consultation with the
studen_t’s overly ambitious advisor.

0 One graduate level course that
has received many complaints for its
pompous, self-aggrandizing professor
who holds three doctorates and was
twice considered for the Nobel Prize.

In addition, an internship of at
least 40 hours per week is recom-
mended for those students who still
find themselves occasionally going to.

other students or otherwise enjoying

As far as leadership outside acad-
emia proper, the department for over-
achiever studies collect local and
national newspaper clippings that ref-
erence students within the depart-
ment. If at the time of graduation a
student’s clippings exceed 200, he or
she will receive a piece of paper with

‘their name written on it in calligraphy

along with the words “A True
Overachiever.” .

We encourage those students with

Anonymous, she's also a client.

Protestors refuse to believe now is a time for war  

The Vietnam Era presented a stage on which the
American student body cemented its wartime role
into the public mind. That role is defined by protest,
dissidence and outright defiance of anythingless
than absolute peace.

This determined stand may look good on paper
and may fuel an interesting pot-induced conversa-
tion, but it is an unproductive position that is easily
ignored when considered with reference to our cur-
rent situation. I .

The hippies and draft card burners of the late
‘60s counterculture may have had a foundation to
stand on, but the peace movement of 2001 is a plat-
form that is shaky at best.

Obviously, no civilized person wants war. Our
generation has known nothing but peace and pros-
perity, and we have no desire to rock the boat.

But lately we have not been offered a choice.
The terrorists have taken action, and that action
demands a response. It is difficult to extend the
olive branch when you must reach over the bodies
of 6,000 of your brothers and sisters to do so.

While many of those who protest military action
as a general rule have swayed in their dedication
recently, there are still those who wave the peace
banner fervently. They may not understand it, but
the issue is no longer a mere intellectual preference
or political leaning — it is an issue of life or death.
Jonathon Alter writes it best in the Oct. 15 issue of
Newsweek, “Critics of the war on terrorism don’t
seem to understand: Someone is trying to kill them.”

' As college students, we seem to hold an unwrit-
ten code of ethics. Our brains are mysteriously coat-
ed with the idea that peace is always right and vio-
lence is always wrong.

I don’t believe that this is the case.
If tomorrow night, while walking home from

Given the nature of our predicament, coupled

The crayons spur the senses
at the Crayola Factory

EVAN CASE
The Pitt News

You would be hard-pressed to find
any college student who doesn’t
immediately recognize Binney ,&
Smith Inc.’s green and yellow box,
the waxy ﬂavor of the crayons, or
their uniquely nostalgic Crayola
smell. '

For almost a century, children
have been drawing, coloring and
imagining with Crayola crayons. For
all whose childhood memories are
happily intertwined with the colored
wax sticks, the Crayola Factory
exists.

While traveling to the Easton, Pa.
factory, I imagined
what I would see

less assembly lines
of conveyor belts,
wax pourers and box
folders; large tour
groups on walkways
and perhaps an over-
sized crayon mascot
in the lobby.

Much to my
enjoyment, I soon
learned that the

Crayola Factory was,
in reality, more of a
family discovery
center than an actual factory. While
the real manufacturing plant is actual-
ly located a few miles away, the
Crayola Factory still contains work-
ing demonstrations of the crayon and
marker—making process — both in a
large, spectator-friendly room.»

The two rectangular demonstra-
tion areas rise up from the wooden
ﬂoor upon what looks like rubberized
Lego padding. Glass walls and yellow
metal poles surround them on all sides
and provide ample viewing space
from any angle. Strategically placed

mirrors and video cameras allow for a
bird’s-eye View of the wrapping and
boxing machinery.

The crayon-wrapping machine
operator, Tom, demonstrated that art
of Crayola crayon creation has
changed very little since the first
boxes sold for a nickel in 1903.

“We’ve added computers to mon-
itor temperature as well as hydraulic-
powered wax scrapers. That’s it,”
Tom said as he poured hot liquid wax
into a metallic mold where it would
eventually harden into 1,200 crayons.

It seems mind‘-boggling, but this
manual crayon creation results in the
formation of 15-20 million crayons
each day. A large scoreboard constant-
ly updates the total
number of Crayola
crayons made since
early last century.
Rising at a rate of
100 per second, the
board reveals that
almost 117 billion
hand-poured and
inspected crayons
have been made so
far.

The prize
crayon of them all
-- crayon No. 100

place of honor in
the Crayola Hall of Fame-, which is a
series of display cases placed along
the "walls of the main room. Mister
Rogers of “Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood” made the 100 bil-
lionth crayon in a shade known as
Blue Ribbon. A Washington grand-
mother won the crayon in a contest,
but later sold it back to Crayola for a
$100,000 bond.

To be sure, the main attractions of
the Crayola Factory are the marker
and crayon creation exhibitions. But

Outside of the Cheese Cellar Cafe at Station

' Square, a bright orange truck/boat pulls up, bellow-

ing a harmonica version of “Old Susarma.” A group
_of people departs, and another 30 people, including
myself, wait patiently in line to climb aboard.

Just Ducky Tours, a land and water tour of

V Pittsburgh, takes tourists around the city in a World‘

Roam  

-War II DUKW Vehicle. The D stands
for 1942, U for utility, K for front

drive. It holds 30 people and can nav-
igate both land and water.

The tour is rife with duck puns and cheesy
humor.

“Welcome aboard my little ducklings, how are

' you today?” asks Chris, the captain. John, the nar-

rator, launches into a brief safety lesson about the
life Vests that rest above us —- which have never
been used. '

He also reveals the basic rules of the tour, one
being that you must give an enthusiastic “quack,
quack, quack” when commanded, or you are

_ deemed a “lame duck.”

‘~ The DUKW travels across the Smithﬁeld Street
Bridge and into Downtown. As it passes the Grant
building, John says that KDKA, the first radio sta-

~ tion in America, made its first broadcast inside.

“What do you say we "give them a quack?” asks
Chris.

“Quack! Quack! Quack!” the captive passen-

Apparently John was not satisﬁed.

“If you are embarrassed, you can just duck.
That was only -two-thirds of a pun, PU!” he says
while holding his nose. W ,

wharf parking lot. It is almost empty this Saturday
afternoon as we approach the litter-ﬁlled ramp that
leads into the river.

The DUKW effortlessly splashes into the
Monongahela River. We head toward
the Point, and Chris asks if anyone on
board would like to drive the boat. The
. few children on board are a little shy,
but with some persuasion by John and Chris, three
volunteer. _

One at a time, the kids steer the DUKW as it
meanders down to the Point and turns around.
Along the way, passengers catch a glimpse of the
newly renovated Fort Pitt Museum and the foun-
tain, which can shoot water up to 150 feet in the air.
The littered ramp to the Mon wharf appears again,
and Chris regains the helm. Each guest captain
receives a sticker that says, “I Drove the Ducky
Boat.” ‘ .

As the tour pulls back into Station Square, pas-
sengers disembark and John lets loose one last pun,
‘ e hope your trip was all it was quacked up to
be.” '

Prepare for an evening of music stripped down to its
raw core. Driving guitar riffs, high-speed drums, dynamic
bass lines and commanding but melodic vocals unite
Tuesday night to form an energetic, in-your—face style of
rock ‘n’ roll. This sound is the essence of Mid Carson
July. . ‘

With a variety of inﬂuences ranging from punk and
hardcore to indie rock and even Johnny Cash, the band is
currently touring the East Coast in support of the release
of their third album, Wessel. With 11 songs in 26 minutes,

V the album cuts out any unneeded substance to simply

relay the band’s pure energy.

During the winter of 1995-1996 in Central
Pennsylvania, brothers Bryon and Eric Lippincott formed
the group in order to create and play music together, with
Michael Schmidt and Dan Oxford now rounding out the
lineup. After years of experience and a move to Tampa,
Fla., the band is now starting to achieve its potential.

Their sound, while always energetic, ranges from
melodic tunes you can dance to, to fast-paced, power
chord-driven songs that will send you heading to the mosh
pit. Songs from Wessel, such as “Guessing Is a Sin” and
“The Unbearable Rightness of Being,” Wll1_'SCt the entire
crowd to vigorous dancing, while songs like “Anthem for
the Apathetic” will ignite frenzy. More than 300 shows
after its inception, Mid Carson July states onits Web site
that they “are still filled with intensity and consistency.”

Whether you are into punk,’ hardcore, indie rock or
evenithat legend Johnny Cash, head over to the Millvale
Industrial Theater tomorrow as Mid Carson July prepares
to explode onto the scene and leave an impact that won’t
soon be forgotten.

As the lights dimmed to near darkness only to slowly
illuminate again with a reddish glow, the audience knew that
dawn was breaking. Later, as the lighting became dark and
cool, heavy with blues and a few greens, the audience felt
calmed, like the spirits of the cemetery we were watching.

The true artistic beauty of Point Park College’s produc-

Grover’s COITICIS, at the turn of the 20th century. Atestament
to the beauty of the minutiae of life,  Town” is at once
heartwarming and foreboding, urging the
viewer to enjoy life to its fullest while not
becoming too impressed with one’s own per-
ceived importance.

Evidently, one of the most difﬁcult
aspects of performing this play lies in the mastery of the
regional accent. In the beginning of the play and every time
a new character is introduced, the dilferences in their accents

become distractingly obvious. Some of the actors speak the_

dialect well, such as Marcus Stevens as the Stage Manager,

Eventually, the audience adjusts to this ‘disparity and is

treated to some very strong performances from much of the ’

cast Michael Tometta as Simon Stimson does a phenomenal

job in a limited role. Although he-only has about 20 lines, he

gives his character enormous depth and credibility, allowing

the viewer to see his embittered and cynical outlook on the
world. -

Mrs. Webb, played by Rayna Favinger,
delivers perhaps the most moving moment of
the play, a monologue against the cruelty of
rnaniage as an institution. The tears in her eyes
appear real, and the despair she feels on her daughter’s wed-
ding day is quite poignant.

Mrs. Gibbs, the mother of the groom, successfully
played by Erika Olenca, grows stronger throughout the play
as her compassionate calm and weary tenderness become the

    

focal points of the third act.

Stevens, as the ornni_scient narrator, is effective especial-
ly in the somber third act, although occasionally his warm
grin becomes redundant and a bit smug. Chad Bender as Dr.
Gibbs is amusing and believable, especially when awkward-
ly talking to his soon—to—be son—in—law.

Sadly, a lackluster perfonnance by the romantic ‘lead
hampers the play. Doug Basalyga as George Gibbs demon-
strates no’ emotion beyond what is explicitly stated in the dia-
logue, and makes no artistic choices other than consistently
furrowing his brow. I-Iis attitude is accurate, but only skin-
deep.

Overall, the incredible sound and lighting complement
the simplicity of the set — there are virtually no props. The
acting is on the whole very good, and the story remains
poignant and moving almost 70 years after its writing. The
production is cheap, local and student-rim; it’s deﬁnitely
worth supporting and seeing.

Africa in relief
Artist finds inspiration in the exotic continent

tomatoes will send your mind wander-
ing back to summer months. Orchids

will jump from the walls, as if with a ‘

secret longing to fill the room with
fragrance._ This is what you will find
when you look at just some of Rita
Gentile-Baiz’s artwork.

Gentile-Baiz lives in Mount

Lebanon, Pa., but she has gathered‘

inspiration for her art from all over the

globe. “Travel is fabulous,” she said,

“it inﬂuences everything you do.”
Gentile-Baiz has traveled across

the United States, visiting the country--

side at least twice a year. She’s been

through Asia and Europe, but she’s -

been most captivated by Africa..

The work in this month’s show
reveals that fascination. The numerous
elephant prints convey beautiful sensi-
tivity. Another piece inspired by her
travels in South Africa and Zimbabwe

is a large African black rhinoceros.‘

Also in the show, is an African woman
of royalty —— a richly colorful portrait
of a faceless woman -—'— and African
masks. She plans’ to continue to visit
the continent where she receives so
much inspiration.
Gentile-Baiz’s pieces
makes herself, using melted resin. She
then adds rich color, giving each one

; its unique, individual existence. The

plates themselves are based on the

photographs that she takes during her

travels.

She has used this technique for
about 10 years, and she began itoin her
desire for plenty of texture. Her tech-
nique yields multi-dimensional paint-
ings, images that quite literally jump

, from the wall. Some of her prints are

so large they havetoi be done in sec-
tions, like the piece she made for the
Pittsburgh Zoo’s centennial.

Such a project ﬁts.-naturallyiwith 7 . A

Gentile-Baiz’s love for animals. She’s

worked with La Fond for about eight I

years, and while she used to specialize
primarily with animals, . she has
recently extended her scope.

Gentile-Baiz believes in persis-' .

tence and determination. A

- “Whatever it is you would like to

achieve — if you can’t do it one way,
you can find another,” she said.
This Chatham College graduate

has certainly seen her persistence pay —

off —— her works are in private and

THE BEST PLACE FOR PIT!‘ SPORTS NEWS

Pitt-iful against Orangemen

 

BRANDON WALOFF/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

Wide receiver Antonio Bryant attempts to break free from three Syracuse
defenders during Saturday’s 42-10 loss to the Orangemen at Heinz Field.

JOE MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

“It was the best of times, it was the
worst oftimes.” 5‘

On Saturday, the Panthers per-
formed their own version of Charles
Dickens’ classic, changing the title to “A
Tale of TWO Halves.”

Heinz Field, Pitt fell to Syracuse 42- 1.0.
The loss was the Panthers’ 11th straight
to the Orangemen, and fourth straight
loss this season.

In the first half, Pitt put pressure on
the Syracuse quarterbacks and controlled

. the battle for ﬁeld position.

In the second half, Pitt was unable to
contain the Syracuse offense and could-
n’t move‘ the ball against its defense’,
crossing into Syracuse territory only
once after halftime.

And for the second week in a row,
the Panthers turned the ball over ﬁve
times, three of which led to Syracuse
touchdowns. '

“We’re trying to do something about
the. tumovers,” Pitt coach Walt Harris
said. “We’re ﬁghting hard, we are just
having trouble overcoming ourselves.”

The Panthers’ defense surrendered
311 yards of offense, including 113
yards rushing by Syracuse’s James

In its first homecoming game at‘

Mungro. Raymond Kirkley led Pitt with
70 yards rushing on 14 carries.

“The defense needs to step up,” safe-
ty Mark Ponko said. “We are letting the
team down with the little mistakes.”

Pitt wide receiver Antonio Bryant
led all players in total yards, catching
three passes for 74 yards and returning
six punts for ‘another 75 yards. But
Bryant’s personal foul at the end of the
first half turned a 37-yard ﬁeld goal
attempt into 52-yard attempt. Kicker
Nick Lotz, who missed three of four
ﬁeld goals, pushed this one wide to the
right.

The only time Lotz did connect was
on a 23-yard kick in the second quarter.

Bryan Knight sacked Syracuse quar-
terback Troy Nunes, forcing a fumble
that Dan Stephens recovered. But Pitt
couldn’t capitalize, settling for Lotz’s
ﬁeld goal and a 10-7 lead.

“We had lots of opportunities [to
score] and we should have,” tackle Rob
Petitti said.

Harris admitted afterward he’d love
to have that series of plays back.

“I called it, I’m responsible for it,”
he said. “We need touchdowns. We did-
n’t take advantage of the opportunities
we had in the first half, just like last

Ineffectiveness stirs up newquarterback debate

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

The controversy used to be-about who the start-
ing quarterback would be. - »
' Now, the dilemma is finding a quarterback who
can_ execute. ~
Pitt continued to falter on offense as the
Panthers fell to the Orangemen Saturday afternoon
behind the ineffectiveness of quarterbacks David
‘Priestley and Rod Rutherford. ' . '
Priestley completed just eight of 20 pass
attempts for 136 yards and was intercepted twice as
disgusted fans booed another poor performance by
_ the ﬁfth-year senior who was replaced in the game
by Rutherford. _
. “It’s frustrating to come out, but when you earn
it, it’s understandable,” Priestley said. “If I played
better I wouldn’t have had to worry about it.”

Rutherford also struggled in his attempt at lead-

ing the Pitt offense. He finished the game just two
of nine in passing for 33 yards and also threw an
interception.

His run from the 1-yard line accounted for the

5-3.. L. '... f..?.,.!..'.

only Panther touchdown of the game.

Turnovers have plagued the Panthers recently
— they have turned the ball over 14 times in the
last three games. Head coach Walt Harris had said
in practice last week that the key to winning the
game would be not turning the ball over, but his
team failed to carry out the plan.

“David wasn’t moving the ball and -I made the
change to Rod for a different look,’’ Harris said.
“He needs to learn that he can’t turn the ball over.’7

Entering the matchup, the Panthers were ranked

second in the conference in passing, averaging

228.2 yards per game. The team has led the Big
East in that category three of the last four seasons.
But now the team struggles to put up even mediocre
numbers. 1 _ ' ' '
On the other side, Syracuse and head coach
Paul Pasqualoni effectively implemented the two-
quarterback system, splitting time between R.J.
Anderson and.Troy Nunes. Nunes was eight of 12
for 77 yards and an interception while Anderson
completed just three of eight passes for 62 yards but
added‘ 11 rushes for another 28 yards _and a touch-
down. A ‘

.‘._'-...'>..'.'...:..’. ‘.'..’....f.-'.'...'. ‘.‘..‘.'..’ .‘. '_.’_.'.'.Z..\~.!-‘l.L.!.!.'..i.’. '.(.l.£.l.{_.l.*.I._'_.t 7 '

According to the statistics, the final score
should not have been as lopsided as it was. The

Orangemen picked up just one more first down than

Pi‘tt‘,*° but the Panthers were also aided a number of
times because of Syracuse penalties. Pitt actually
controlled the ball for more than a minute more
than Syracuse and had an average punt of 51.3
yards compared to 43 yards by the Orangemen.

But the inability to perform on offense and have
a solid leader at quarterback made a difference for
the Panthers. Pitt quarterbacks have now been
intercepted six times in the last two games, and
Harris continues to switch betwee_n the two, a tactic
that makes it easier for opposing defenses to know
what play will be called since Priestley usually
passes and Rutherford usually runs.

Pitt is now 1-4 on the season and lost five of its
last six games dating back to last yea:’s loss to
Iowa State in the Insight.com Bowl. The lone win
came against Division I—AA opponent East
Tennessee State in the first game of the season. The
Panthers will need to find a quarterback who can
execute in order to be productive the remainder of
the season.

Basketball opens year with madness

JEREMY JESTER
Staff Writer

No one won $25,000. Or even

$5,000. But Midnight Madness Friday ‘

night at Fitzgerald Field House gave
the crowd a glimpse into the future of
Pitt basketball.

Andrew Stockey from WTAE-TV
emceed the annual event that marks
the beginning of practice for both the

’ men’s and women’s basketball teams.

Doors opened at 11 p.m. welcom-
ing the throng of fans waiting outside.
The student section quickly "ﬁlled as
some were forced to sit in the upper
level. Fans received rafﬂe tickets as
they entered the ﬁeld house.

The festivities began with Stockey
choosing contestants from the crowd
to participate in games such as
“Around the World,” “Izzy Dizzy,”
“Lay-up, free‘-throw, three-point con-
test” and a chance to win $5,000.

After air balls, bricks and a few
baskets, the clock read 11:50.

court. They performed a Michael

Jackson routine, with the lights out.

11:54  4

Next it was the cheerleaders’ turn
to rouse the crowd with a routine of
their own. Time dwindled to 11:57.

The‘ pep band added Pitt fight
songs. 11:59 

With the crowd counting down the
seconds, the clock hit midnight and
the teams took the court. First, though,
they had to be introduced.

Each player was announced while
tossing T-shirts to the frenzied crowd.
They introduced themselves through a
microphone at center court. At this
point, the fans were primed for action.

The three-point contest was up
first on the agenda with four co-ed
teams vying as the top shooters. Junior
Brandin Knight and freshman Haley
Harguth won the contest with scores
of 10 and seven, respectfully.

The men’s team then split off into
two teams for the blue-gold scrim-

mage. The 10-minute game was high-

lighted by three dunks from redshirt

freshman Mark McCarroll, a reverse
layup from junior Donatas Zavackas
and a windmill slam from lone senior
Chad Johnson that received raucous

approval from the crowd.

The lean, 6-foot-10-inch
McCarroll was a surprise as he used
his long arms to grab rebounds and
dunk the ball.

Sophomore Julius Page handled
the ball often as he reversed his‘ mesh
jersey and played for both squads.
Every time he touched the ball it
seemed he wanted to drive to the bas-
ket and score.

The game ended with the blue
team winning 23-18.

The women did not have a scrim-
mage. They would have to wait until
practice at 8:30 that morning for their
turn. I
The slam dunk contest was next
with the contestants being Page,
Johnson, walk-on sophomore Gino
Federico, McCarroll and sophomore
Toree Morris. Initially, the cheerlead-
ers were supposed to decide the Win-

ner, but Stockey took the job after the

crowd voiced its disapproval of the

idea. V
Page won the contest, wowing the
crowd with a windmill dunk and a jam

that left his elbow hanging inside the .

rim. A McCarrollx between-the-legs
dunk and _a Federico reverse slam

made the decision interesting for _

Stockey.

The six people who were picked to '

try to win $5,000 were then instructed
to make a layup, foul shot, three-
pointer and a half-court shot in 25 sec-
onds to win. No one came close.

Stockey then announced that the ’

rafﬂe tickets handed out at the door
would decide the participant for the
$25,000 prize. The winner tried her

luck at a three-quarter court shot. To _

the crowd’s disappointment, she came
up short.

As everyone dissipated into anoth- .
er Saturday morning, hoop dreams of -

another men’s Big East run and the
women making their own tournament
were etched into Panther fans’ minds.

Big East, page 20

Is it a Pitt sports tradition to get its
fans excited about a sports team and then
fail miserably the next year? I can only
imagine what the men’s basketball team
will do this year after giving this school
some hope last year in the Big East
Tournament and the National Invitational
Tournament ‘

How about the women’s basketball
team, who made the NIT two seasons ago
and last season didn’t even make the con-
ference tournament? Then there is the
men’s soccerteam that was ranked in the
top 10 last years, and yet it ,can’t seem to
win a game this year.

ThentherewasthisgreatfootballteamatPitIin1997.Itmade .
the Liberty Bowl that year and everything looked promising. The
following year, Pitt followed up its bowl performance with a ridicu-
lous 2-9 season. 

Last year, the Panthers enjoyed their best season in more than
.10 years with a 7-5 record and an appearance in the Insightcom‘
Bowl. And how did the Panthers follow that season? Currently we
are a 1-4 team that hasn’t beaten a Division I-A opponent yet.

. After Saturday’s disgraceful 42-10 loss to Syracuse, my room-
mate and I wrote a song for the occasion. '

Panthers break Freeney’s streak

Syracuse, page 15

we .”

Pitt’s offensive line contained
Syracuse’s best pass rusher, Dwight
Freeney, who leads the nation in sacks. It
was the first time in 15 games that
Freeney did not record a sack.

“We did a good job on [Freeney],”
Petitti said. “I had help from Lousaka
Polite and Raymond Kirkley. They were
slowing him down and he got tired of
being hit.” ’

The Panthers got on the board first,
with only about two minutes remaining
in the first quarter. After Bryant’s 41-
yard reception put the ball at the
Syracuse 1-yard line, Rod Rutherford
snuck around the left side of the line for
his fourth rushing touchdown of the
year.

Syracuse tied the game in the second
quarter after recovering a fumble by Kris

Wilson. Five plays later, Nunes found.

Maurice Jackson for a 27-yard touch-
down, tying the game at seven. ,

The Orangemen scored again on
their second play of the third quarter.
Quarterback R.J. Anderson ran the
option, drawing the defense toward him
before pitching to Mungro. Fifty-six
yards later, Mungro had a touchdown
and Syracuse had the lead, 14-10.

The Syracuse defense added to that

lead on Pitt’s next possession. Will.

Hunter intercepted a David Priestley
pass, returning it 35 yards for the touch-
down and a 21-10 lead.

The Panthers’ offense made one
more serious drive late in third quarter.
Starting from their own 20-yard line,
Rutherford completed passes of 16 yards
to Bryant and 17 yards to R.J. English to
move Pitt to the Syracuse 17-yard line.

But the drive stalled there and
Clifton Smith blocked Lotz’s ﬁeld goal.

“We were down two _scores and

needed to get something positive hap-

pening,” Harris said about his choice to
not go for the ﬁrst down. “We were try-
ing to get something out of a long, hard
drive and get some hope.”

Syracuse added touchdown runs by
Kyle Johnson and Walter Reyes in the
fourth quarter, making the score 42-10
and putting the game well out of reach
for Pitt. - _

“Some changes definitely need to be
made,” Priestley said. “We have played
better before and should again. We can
still salvage this season.”

“We need to come together, get
tighter and better,” Amir Purifoy added.

Next week, Pitt travels to ‘Boston
College to take on the Eagles. The
Panthers won last year’s meeting, 42-26,
at Three Rivers Stadium.

“We’re going to try to do the best we
can to win the next ball game,” Harris
said. “I’m going to do the best I can to
get the players to. find the good they have
in them.” ‘

touchdown as the Owls silenced Rutgers
30-5. Temple nmning back Tanardo Sharps
rushed for 149 yards on 18 carries.

Temple (2-3) opened the game mod-
estly with two ﬁrst quarter ﬁeld goals by
Cap Poklemba. The Owls then broke out in
the second half, scoring 21 points as quar-
terback Mike McGann threw 13- and 45-
yard touchdown passes. McGann ﬁnished
10 for 23 for 170 yards. The Scarlet Knights
(1-5) added a ﬁrst halfﬁeld goal to bring the
score at halftime to 27-3.

Temple added one more ﬁeld goal and
Rutgers had a safety to account for all of the
second half points.

Freshman quarterback Ryan Cubit
went 17 of 41 for 171 yards for Rutgers in
the loss. He was sacked ﬁve times and
threw three interceptions.

A Lecture & Learning
Series on Journalism

Tired of just reading the daily newspaper? Here’s your chance
to make news.

This fall, The Pitt News will offer a series of talks on how to do
journalism. Come learn about how it’s done, and then consider
actually making history by doing it for the University’s only
independent daily newspaper. '

Applications will be available at each talk in case you like

what you hear and want to work for The Pitt News. Or just
stop by, learn a little, and talk with the people who already
edit and write the newspaper.
