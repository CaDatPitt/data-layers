suspends
NSN due
to shanty
incidents

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

The New Student Network has
had its Pitt certification suspend-
ed stemming from incidents in-
volving the shanty constructed in
February to aid the homeless.

According to Joe Cavalla, direc-
tor of the Office of Student Activi-
ties, ”We felt they did not file the
proper forms after we asked them
to, and they did not take down
the structure after we asked them
to.”

I'm very depressed. I
don’t know what to do
at this point. I guess
crea ti ve charity is
against the law.

— Bill Frizlen

NSN President Angie Hirsh
was unavailable for comment;
however, co—founder Bill Frizlen
said that the NSN is upset about
the charges brought against them.

Frizlen said, ”We collected
loads of food and
clothes for the homeless, yet
we're de-certified and charged
[$275 for the shanty’s removal].
The maintenance people, when
they took away our shanty, never
told us that we would be charged
for it."

Because of the suspension,
”[The NSN] cannot use campus

facilities, formally meet at the
university or sponsor programs
here,” Cavalla said.

He explained that the NSN's
case will be reviewed in Septem-
ber, and at that time, if they com-
ply with rules, there is a
possibility they will be re-
certified.

Cavalla added that after talking
to the group, he felt that it would
continue as an organization.

Frizlen said, ’’I’m very
depressed. I don’t know what to
do at this point. I guess creative
charity is against the Iaw.”

According to Frizlen, the Pitt
chapter of the NSN was created
in January, ”to simply, and I
know this sounds cliche, make
the world, in specific [sic], the Pitt
area, better for humanity. We
won't be satisfied until everyone
has adequate food and shelter.
When all the problems in the
world are solved, we can cease
to exist.”

Desillers refuses to pay hospital

By Erik Kridle

and Mark R. Brown
The Pitt News

Pittsburgh Children's Hospital
has filed a lawsuit against Maria
Desillers on the charges of her
refusing to pay $261,189 in
hospital costs for three liver trans-
plants on her late son Ronnie.
However, according to David
Jones and Harold Robbins, attor-
neys for Desillers, she refuses to
pay the bills on the claim that
they are ”over-inflated” and that
her son received ”poor quality
medical care."

Attorney David Jones,
Desillers’ legal counsel in Pitts-
burgh and professor in Pitt's ad-
ministration of justice
department, explained that
Desillers ”does not understand
how Children's Hospital in Pitts-
burgh came up with her bill. She
feels it [the bill] is undeserved.”

According to Jones, Desillers
cites ”overinflated billing" by the
hospital and ”poor quality medi-
cal care” as the chief reasons why
she has not agreed to pay the
balance of her son's medical ex-
penses.

Attorney Harold Robbins of Mi-
ami, also representing Desillers,
said that there is presently
enough money remaining in the
Ronnie Desillers Transplant Fund
to pay the $261,189 bill.

Attorney Robbins set the
amount of money raised for Ron-
nie’s operation at $660,000.

According to Robbins, the
three ”internal memos”
produced by Maria Desillers at a
news conference last week in

Florida contained complaints
made by Dr. D. Ryan Cook, head
anesthesiologist at Pittsburgh
Children's Hospital, to hospital
Medical Director William
Donaldson about the quality of
care received by transplant pa-
tients.

‘ 

She feels it is un-
deserved
—— David [ones

Robbins said that these docu-
ments speak of patients receiving
carelessly selected organs. One
doctor, quoted from one of the
memos, said, ”Livers are
switched like peas in a shell.”

Robbins went on to say that
Desillers and legal counselors
have possession of ”about a half
dozen” additional documents
supporting Desillers’ claims of
low quality care.

Lynn McMahon, spokesperson
for Pittsburgh Children's Hospi-
tal, said that the documents
which Maria DeSillers has
released to the press have no ap-
plicability to her late son Ron-
nie’s case.

”What Ms. Desillers has shared
with the press are correspon-
dence generated as part of a regu-
lar peer review among the
medical staff of Children's Hospi-
tal and the medical faculty of the
University of Pittsburgh, which
were written between October
1987 and March 1988,” said
McMahon.

According to McMahon, ’’Fol-
lowing transplant cases, careful
reviews are conducted by staff in-
volved. Questions are raised, and
extensive discussions are held.
Ms. DeSiller’s concern regarding
these correspondencelsl and her
late son is unfounded."

McMahon said that Children's
Hospital's success rate regarding
transplants is on par with the na-
tional success rate of approxi-
mately 80 percent, and that
Children's Hospital ”is notewor-
thy, in that it accepts more criti-
cally ill children than anywhere
else in the world.”

Recently, it became public
knowledge that Brigette Mur-
taugh, a nurse on the intensive
care unit during Ronnie Desillers’
operations, had received at least
18 death threats over the tele-
phone. Regarding this, McMahon
commented, ”Children’s Hospi-
tal cannot confi rm the number of
threatening phone calls which
Murtaugh received, but the
Hospital is concerned and is in-
vestigating. At this time, there is
no way to determine the source
of the threats."

In addition to the lawsuit
against Desillers by Children's
Hospital, Desillers is currently
under investigation by the
Department of Business Regula-
tions for allegedly failing to file
for a charity license under a Flori-
da law.

Attorney Robbins stated that
Desillers is considering bringing
charges of malpractice against
Pittsburgh Children's Hospital
and other parties involved in her
son's case.

 

 

PHILADELPHIA —— Lawyers fi-
nally completed a jury Tuesday
for the murder trial of mob boss
Nicodemo ”Litt|e Nicky" Scarfo
and eight organized crime associ-
ates after seven weeks of ques-
tioning more than 700 people.

The sixth alternate juror was
seated in the morning and then
sequestered with the other 15
chosen since the selection
process began early in February.

Until the trial is over, expect-
ed sometime in late May or early
June, the jury will remain under
guard of Philadelphia sheriff's
deputies, spending days in the
City Hall courtroom and nights in
a nearby hotel.

Common Pleas Judge Albert
Sabo, concerned about impanel-
ing a fair and impartial jury and
also originally sought to have it
chosen in a Pennsylvania county
outside Philadelphia, recessed
the trial until April 5 after the jury
was completed.

Then Assistant District Attorney
Barbara Christie, the chief prose-
cutor, and defense lawyers will

the start of testimony.

Scarfo, 59, and the other eight
defendants are charged with the
1984 execution of mob figure
Salvatore Testa who reportedly
was challenging Scarfo for con-
trol -of the organization.

All nine were denied bail.

Scarfo, whose home is in Atlan-
tic City, N.J., where he has a ce-
ment business, has been in jail
nearly 18 months. During that
time, he has been convicted in
federal court of conspiring with
a Philadelphia councilman to ex-
tort $1 million from a waterfront
developer.

He also was acquitted by a fed-
eral jury, with seven other mob
associates, of heading up a
million-dollar drug operation.

ment associated with the drawn-
out jury selection in which the

Boy at Children's

rejects his new liver

FREMONT, Ohio —- A five-
month-old boy has rejected a
new liver nearly a month after un-
dergoing transplant surgery at a
Pittsburgh hospital, his mother
said Tuesday.

Tami Heflinger said her son,
Chad, has been placed on a wait-
ing list for another liver
transplant.

”He is just like he was before
the surgery, only worse,” she said
from Children's Hospital, where
the 15-hour operation was per-
formed March 2.

Chad needed the first trans-
plant because he had biliary atre-
sia, which blocked the flow of
bile through his digestive system.
Without the operation, doctors
gave the child about a year to
live.

But two weeks after Chad's sur-
gery, he contracted viral hepati-

Rare hawks no longer

hindering repair job

PITTSBURGH The
$3.4—million reconstruction of a
city bridge is proceeding uninter-
rupted now that workers have de-
termined that two red-tailed
hawks’ nests in the superstructure
contained no eggs.

”We evicted the birds,” said
John Perri, a city field engineer
for the Swindell Bridge project.
”When the iron workers get
there, they'll probably just kick
the nests out."

State wildlife conservation
officer Dale Hockenberry peered
through a hole in the bridge deck
Monday to examine the nests.
Had he found eggs, workers
would have been prohibited from
tampering with or disturbing
them.

Red-tailed hawks, like other
migratory birds, are protected by

Class examines roots of prejudice .

UBy Autumn Buckley
For The Pitt News

Pitt's Kinder Kinetics 
teaches tots awareness

when first organizing. also has written a book called

Jews and Blacks, a course
taught at Pitt by Dr. Barbara Bur-
stin, tackles the sensitive issue of
prejudice on campus and in to-
day's society.

’/Students who take this course
say there are problems with
prejudice on this campus, and I

Just their opinion,” said Burstin.

”Prejudice at Pitt is not obvi-
ous,” said Macy Kisilimsky, a
Jewish student taking Burstin’s
course this semester. ”Prejudice
here is undercover; that's the dan-
gerous part about it. It exists in
the narrow—mindedness of stu-
dents and in the administration.”

”Pitt’s one of the most racist
campuses in the United States Pitt
is very hostile to minorities, and
about 98 percent of Blacks on
campus would agree with me,”
said Mark Collins, political action

Ochairperson for the Black Action

Society and also a student taking
Jews and Blacks this semester.
”I haven't personally run into
extreme racism,” Collins added.
However, Collins stated that the
BAS did experience problems

Kappa Psi

By Julie Brunbeck '
For The Pitt News

Kappa Psi, one of Pitt's aca-
demic pharmacy fraternities, held
a celebration marking 75 years at
the university. In the three-
quarters of a century that Kappa
Psi has been at Pitt, it has under-

”Blacks had to struggle to get
the BAS, and they have to strug-
gle to keep it going,” he said.

Burstin said the reason she
created the course was the need
for increased understanding.

”When Farrakhan came to
Pittsburgh about three years ago,
there was a lot of hostility, mis-
understanding and antagonism
without any interest in under-
standing why people were saying
what they were. At a forum in
response to Farrakhan, which I
was involved in organizing, a lot
of overt, negative things were
said. This made it clear to me that
people didn't understand where
Blacks and Jews were coming
from.”

Burstin has had an ongoing in-
terest in improving understand-
ing. She has sensitized public
school teachers to issues of
prejudice. She is the president of
the American Jewish Committee,

an organization devoted to-

”inter-group relations,” and she
is the host of Shalom Pittsburgh,
a television program which deals
with topics of interest to Jews and
others in the community. She

celebrates

gone many changes that have
helped shape its present
character.

Chartered at the university in
1913 as an all-male fraternity,
Kappa Psi later allowed females
to become members due to drop-
ping membership and an increas-
ing number of women entering

From Poland to Pittsburgh, which
is a study of Jews and Christians
who survived the holocaust in
Poland and have moved to
Pittsburgh.

”This course gives an under-
standing of Jews and Blacks as
people. However, only a tiny
number of students from this
campus go to my class,” she said.

According to Collins and
Kisilimsky, the course has been a
help to them.

”Jews and Blacks is one of my
favorite courses,” said Collins. ”I
learned a lot about Jewish people
that I didn't know. I made my first
Jewish friend there," said Collins.

Back in February, Collins and
Kisilimsky helped organize a
”Black-Jewish Dialogue,” a fo-
rum for exchange between the
two groups. It involved Jewish
and Black representatives, includ-
ing Burstin and Dr. Laurence
Glasco, also from Pitt's history
department.

Collins and Kisilimsky plan to
do this again in April, due to the
favorable response they received.

Children as young as two
years old are being taught
body awareness through the
Kinder Kinetics programs,
which are being held at Pitt

throughout April in the Multi-

purpose Room and in the
small pool at Trees Hall.

Dr. Gere Gallagher, an as-
sociate with the University of
Pittsburgh Department of In-
struction, is the coordinator of
the program.

’’It’s easier to learn skills
when you're young,” Gal-
lagher said. ”And you develop
more self-confidence and a lot
of adaptable skills.”

Instructional assistants are
Mary Lou Olmo and Gail
Polkos, both graduate doctor-
al students.

Olmo said that the primary
purpose of Kinder Kinetics is
to promote the development
of motor skills.

”They [children] need to
learn the awareness of their
body in space whether it's on
land or in the water," Olmo
said. "When they're in the
water, it eliminates the fears.
We make it fun."

The program requires Chil-
dren to successfully complete
mazes and games which in-
volve skipping, hopping,
jumping and throwing.

”I swim at home some-
times,” said 5-year-old Mat-
thew Lenard, "but I practice
here. I like to swim, and I like
to swim here. I learned to
blow bubbles. We jump rope
here and throw ba|ls.”

According to Gallagher,
Kinder Kinetics works upon
the principle that children
learn best when they are un-
afraid and when their interest
is aroused. A

Gallagher said, ”Because
we have a teacher-student ra-
tio of one teacher to three or
five students and we stress a

successful environment, we,

don't have a lot of cryers.

”We play to break down
fears," she added. ”We avert
their attention.”

The fee for the program is
$70. ”[There are] two parts
of the program,” said Gal-
lagher. ”[We] have one that is
regular Kinder Kinetics and
special Kinder Kinetics.

Kinder Kinetics for special
kids helps children with learn-
ing disabilities, Down’s Syn-
drome, mental retardation and
other handicaps to develop
coordination and other motor
skills.

”He was so excited,” said
Wilua Boyer about her grand-
son Brandon Pitts. ”He just
started.”

Gallagher said that there
will also be sessions over the
summer.

Voters should make
the Jackson choice

It is said that the more things change, the more they remain
the same. Such has certainly been the case of the presidential
primaries so far this year. With the exception of Bruce Babbitt,
the prospects for the nomination seemed unstimulating, to say
the very least. Since those early days, there have indeed been

changes.

Gary Hart was convicted of one of the most popular moral
indiscretions in the country, and was forced, finally, from the
race. Richard Gephardt dropped out on Monday. Bob Dole
cashed in Tuesday afternoon. Albert Gore and Pat Robertson
have chosen to remain in the race, seemingly more interested
in a statement than a nomination.

So, as the conventions roll around, the real choices have been
narrowed to George Bush, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
Barring the appearance of a new candidate at either of the con-

‘/entions, one of those three men will most likely be the next

president.

In the race between Dukakis and Jackson, we feel that the
candidate with the most delegates should be nominated. The
voters should decide whether Jackson is electable or not.

In a nutshell 

Economists are people the Lord put on earth to make

astrologers look good.

Picture was in poor taste

We are writing about the pic-
ture that appeared in The Pitt
News Tuesday, March 15, on
page six in the article entitled
”Give them a break.” We find
the picture of the women inside
the fences, with the men with
cameras all around them, very
offensive.

First of all, what is the purpose
of printing the picture in The Pitt
News? Does it show Pitt students
(either the women behind the
fencing or the men trying to
climb over it)? Furthermore, what
was the purpose of the picture it-
self: To entice people, particular-
ly men, to go on Pitt's trip to
Daytona; to excite the reading
public; or to document another
example of men seeing women
only for their physical attributes?

Rather than proceed into the
whole issue of women's rights

LETTERS

and the whole issue of men ob-

jectifying women, we will only
state we find this picture a poor
reflection of the women behind
the fencing, and both men who
have their cameras in tow and
those who are so eager to climb
over the fencing. In addition, we
find it strange that The Pitt News
would choose to place it in the
newspaper at all, particularly so
near the news section of the
paper. Certainly, there is a lot
more important and noteworthy
news happening in the world and
in our campus community that
you should be informing us
about.

As Pitt Students, and people
who generally try to read The Pitt

News, this appears to be only one
more example of the paper's in-
ability to decide whether to real-
ly serve the campus community
in reporting news and events, or
to be a ”rag,” or a forum for
unimportant, trivial and offensive
pieces. [...]

We hope you will reflect at
least a moment on your purpose
and goals and redirect the focus
of The Pitt News,  an indepen-
dent student-written and student-
managed newspaper for the Oak-
land campus of the University of
Pittsburgh  to serve the com-
munity’s needs.

A retrospective look at the Bush League team

In the beginning, nobody real-
ﬁt worried about it. As George
Bush had said before he was
elected president in November,
1988: ”Loyalty is not considered
a character flaw in my family.”
Most people assumed that his te-
nacious loyalty to Ronald Reagan
was a camapaign strategy, and a
successful one at that.

Bush had been, you remember,
hoisted into the presidency on
the coattails of his predecessor.
He was the Velcro Candidate, the
man who had stuck with Reagan

. ”through thick and thin."

The campaign of 1988 was
almost like running for Veep
again. There were those famous
commercials claiming that this
was America's last chance to vote
for Ronald Reagan. There were
all those bumper stickers saying
that George was ”One more for
the Gipper.”

Of course, the issue freaks,
even Republicans, thought that

‘he should have worked out his

own ideas a bit more fully, rather
than taking Ronnie's. But others
were pleased with the succinct-
ness of his answers to all the

difficult questions facing Ameri-
ca: Me, too.

Today, of course, from our van-
tage point in 1991, it is easy to
look back and see the intima-
tions. On March 20, 1988, he
had supported Ronald Reagan's
veto of the civil rights bill with
these words: ’’I’m not going to
start differing with the president
after 7 1/2 years  I'm going to
stand with the president.”

But how many ‘of us truly
would have guessed that he
would still have been standing
with Ronald Reagan even now,
more than halfway through his
own administration? Who would
have believed that he would still
think it was disloyal to speak for
himself? Or even think for
himself?

The inauguration of 1989 had
admittedly been a surprise.
Maybe it was the Morning in
America speech. It sounded so
familiar. When a television an-
chor asked why he didn't have
his own ideas, President Bush
had spat back, ”If the price of the
presidency is for me to turn my
back on Ronald Reagan, the price

 

'  was

   

ELLEN
GOODMAN

is too steep for me to pay.”

Then there was Bush's peculiar
reluctance to move into the big
White House on Pennsylvania
Avenue. He didn't want anyone
to think he was stepping on Rea-
gan’s turf.

When Barbara Walters did that
famous visit to the Bush White
House in 1990, he confessed
what had been long rumored.
Yes, he kept the Oval Office un-
used as a kind of testimonial to
his former boss. He even showed
Walters the jelly-bean jar that

Reagan had given him as a going-
away present. He hadn't eaten
the orange ones yet.

Eventually, people got used to
the idea that there wasn't going
to be any transition. They
stopped waiting for something
new to happen. Bush explained
that it would be wrong to offer
any policies of his own. He just
wasn't the kind of guy who
would turn on an old pal like
Ronald Reagan. He believed in
steadfastness, reliability and de-
pendability.

It grew sort of comfortable, ac-
tually — rather like watching old
re-runs. The same old issues kept
coming up. Why, as recently as
February of 1991, he filed a bill
to fund the Contras even though
there were only 37 Contras left,
living in Miami. He stuck with
Reagan ”through thick and thin.”

The odd thing was that Presi-
dent Bush went to all those funer-
als.“ The Yugoslavian minister of
agriculture died, and off he went.
Funerals seem to make him hap-
py. Indeed, being president made
him happy on the whole,
although Bush still jumped when

they played Hail to the Chief, as
if Reagan would come in and
catch him playing Chief.

These were years without press
conferences, although he occa-
sionally reissued transcripts of old
ones played against a helicopter
track. Attached to the bottom was
a smiley card that reiterated the
Bush foreign policy as he ex-
pressed it first in 1984: ’’I’m for
Ronald Reagan  blindly.”

Only once, a reporter snuck
onto Air Force One-A (Bush had
retired Reagan's old Number
One) and confronted the man.
Wasn't it time he stood on his
own? But Bush retorted harshly,
’’I’m not going to start differing
with Reagan after 11 years.”

Didn't he feel obliged to talk to
the American people? Bush an-
swered no; he only gave his opin-
ions to Ronald Reagan, and that
was in confidence.

The reporter wrote in a small
notebook what we would come
to know as the theme song of the
Bush League Years: Semper
Fidelis. .

Freon producers warn about dangers to ozone

By Don Beman
Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA —— Imagine a
hot summer day in a 40th floor
office in Dallas, Philadelphia or
Manhattan with no air condition-
ing. Or imagine water coolers,
refrigerators and even the AC but-
ton on your car's dashboard be-
ing permanently shut off.

That probably won't happen,
but that's the magnitude of the
crisis that is now developing, ac-
cording to two of the top three
producers of the gas that makes
air conditioning and refrigeration
equipment work.

Both Du Pont of Wilmington,
Del., the largest manufacturer,
and Pennwalt of Philadelphia, the
third largest, are firmly on record
as saying the latest findings about
the depletion of the earth's ozone

layer require drastic steps. They
say the manufacture of the
refrigerant fully—halogenated
chlorofluorocarbons should stop
because CFCs are destroying the
protective ozone layer.

CFC is more commonly known
by the Du Pont trade name Freon
and Pennwa|t’s trade name
lsotron.

”lt’s an unprecedented situa-
tion,” Lawrence J. Woodward of
Pennwalt said in an interview
Tuesday. ”We’re talking about
something that could alter the
civilized world.”

Edwin E. Tuttle, Pennwa|t’s
chairman and chief executive
officer, said the ozone depletion
”issue is a global problem and for
this reason it must be addressed
on a global basis.” Tuttle said he
isn't condoning any sudden
cutoffs but emphasized that there

is no realistic alternative.

”Anything less than a global
agreement anda global solution
will not solve the problem,” Tut-
tle said.

The immediate problem is a
substitute, Tuttle said. Du Pont’s
Tony McCain, in charge of his

firm’s efforts to come up with an .

alternative, said many companies
are headed in similar directions.
But no one has the answer, yet.

”No, nobody expects to stop
producing next week,” said
Woodward. ”But we all do know
what must be done and that
means for now no one knows
where the industry is going."

Woodward said the chlorine
content is the culprit. Pennwalt
has already developed a sub-
stance with 5 percent of the erod-
ing capacity of current
compounds.

But no one wants to jump in
that direction just yet, because of
the cost of retooling. ”They think
there might be something else
soon,” Woodward said.
However, he said industry
sources indicate solutions are five
years away. .

”We’re talking about million
of dollars on research, and mil-
lions more, possibly billions, in
new manufacturing equipment,”
Woodward said.

Industry figures show CFC
production is a $28 billion indus-
try in the United States that em-
ploys about 7l5,000 in 5,000
companies.

The flurry of interest and the
solid resolve of Du Pam and
Pennwalt stems from a March 15
report by an international group
of 100 scientists led by NASA.
The panel concluded that CFCs
may have contributed to a 2 per-

New honor society for

cent decrease in global ozonﬂ
since 1970. The report also con-

cluded that CFCs are the major

contributor to a larger decrease in

the ozone over Antarctica.

The earth's ozone layer is the
filter that blocks the more danger-
ous rays from the sun before they
reach, for example, human skin,
and cause damage.

The 1987 Montreal Protocol
obligates signatory nations fl’
conduct a full review of CFC haz-
ards by 1990 and to end all
production by the year 2000.

Tuttle, supported by Du Pont,
said the timetable is much too
slow, and not enough attention is
being focused on the situation.

”We urge the U.S. government
to do all in its power to hasten
ratification of this treaty by all of
the signatory nations,” Tuttle
said.

juniors and seniors

By Rich Cholodofsky

Staff Writer

A new honors society has been
created at Pitt for full—time juniors
and seniors with at least a 3.3
grade point average.

Golden Key National Honor
Society was formally recognized
as an official organization before
spring break, and a membership
drive is currently underway.

Membership is available for
any full—time students who meet
the requirements, and students in
all Pitt schools, including the Col-
lege of General Studies, are
eligible.

Stephen Pracht, director of
Chapter Development of Golden
Key, described the purpose of the
honor society: "We encourage
participation for voluntary service
on the campus and community.
 Our purpose is also to recog-
nize and encourage outstanding
acedemics."

Pracht said that scholarships
will be awarded to members.
”The top junior and senior in the
Pitt chapter will be presented
with a scholarship between
$250-$400."

  
 
  

Students who are eligible will
receive a letter of invitation in the
mail. ”There is a lifetime mem-
bership fee of $45 due by April
10,” said Pracht. He added, ”We
expect somewhere around 250
people to respond.”

Suzanne Sawyer, one of the
founding members, explained
her reasons for starting the honors
society. ’’I thought the opportu-
nity to be a [founder] of an or-
ganization that would be here
when I am gone was exciting.”

Sawyer said that the Pitt chap-

ter wants to continue some pro— Q3

grams that were initiated by the
national organizations and other
campus chapters.

”An activity we'd like to have
started is called Shadow Days,
which started at Arizona State,”
said Sawyer.

Shadow Days is an event in
which high school seniors are in-
vited on campus and have a
Golden Key member chaperon
them around college for a day.

”We would also like to con-
tinue the national program, ‘The
Best of America Say No,’ which
promotes a drug-free lifestyle,"
said Sawyer.

Dole resigns from race, says instinct behind move

1 WASHINGTON —- Republican

Sen. Bob Dole quit the presiden-
tial race Tuesday, three weeks af-
ter being buried in George Bush's
Super Tuesday landslide, calling
himself ”bloodied but unbowed,
as the poet says.” On the
Democratic side, Michael
Dukakis sought a Connecticut
primary victory to slow Jesse
Jackson.

The Kansas senator offered his
congratulations to Bush, who
beat him in a solid majority of
primaries and said, ”Keeping the
White House Republican, that's
the bottom line.”

Flanked by his wife, former
Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, and his daughter
Robin, Dole said, "I know, and
my family knows that I'm a fight-
er, and I don't like to lose,” Dole
said, surrounded by House and
Senate colleagues. ’’I make no
apology for that. It's simply the

0-way I am.”

But he said he also was an op-
timist. ”|’ve been beaten before
and no doubt will again. But I've
never been defeated and never
will be.”

Dole, who has been without a
primary win for more than a
month, tipped his hat to Bush.

”The one thing you learn how
to do pretty well in our business
is to count. You come to trust
your instincts to tell you it's over.
In my heart, I know that time is
now. I congratulate George Bush
and wish him well in Novem-
ber,” the Kansas senator said.

Swaggart sentenced;

off air for one year

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -— Evan-
gelist Jimmy Swaggart on Tues-
day was conditionally suspended
for two years by the Assemblies
of God in connection with alle-
gations that he hired a prostitute
to pose naked.

Swaggart was also ordered to
undergo rehabilitation for two
years and was ordered out of the
pulpit for a period of not less than
one year. He was also ordered
not to appear on his television
show for one year.

The Pentecostal church's
General Presbytery had the final
say on the fiery preacher’s
punishment. Its decision was
more severe than the three-month

suspension recommended by the
Louisiana branch of the church.

Gus Weill, a spokesman for
Jimmy Swaggart Worldwide
Ministries in Baton Rouge, La.,
declined immediate comment on
the denomination’s decision.

People approved by the church
would supervise Swaggart’s re-
habilitation, the Rev. G. Ray-
mond Carlson, general
superintendent of the church,
said at a news conference. He
provided no other details of the
sanctions.

The rehabilitation period
would begin when Swaggart
agreed to the terms in writing. He
has 30 days to respond.

Carlson said he had notified
Swaggart of the decision.

”He thanked me,” Carlson
said. ”He expressed thanks, and
I had prayer with him over the
telephone.”

A member of the General Pres-
bytery, H. Maurice Lednicky, said
most of the discussion in the two-
day meeting of the group was
over the power of the 13—member
Executive Presbytery to impose
punishment in the case.

The Louisiana District had im-
posed a three-month suspension
from the pulpit for Swaggart and
had refused to reconsider it on re-
quest of the Executive Presbytery,
which sought a stiffer penalty.
The executive board noted that
every other Assemblies of God
minister who has confessed to
moral failure has been barred
from the pulpit for at least a year,
officials said.

At the meeting, it was agreed
that the Executive Presbytery did
have constitutional authority in
the case, and the punishment
given Swaggart was the same that
the Executive Presbytery had
originally recommended, said
Lednicky, president of the Assem-
blies of God Central Bible Col-
lege in Springfield.

The unprecedented crackdown
on the 1.5 million Arabs in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip was aimed at halting four
months of unrest and at prevent-
ing mass demonstrations by
Palestinians on Wednesday's

12th anniversary of Land Day,
when Israeli soldiers killed six
Arabs protesting land confis-
cation.

Foreign relief workers were
barred from entering the oc-
cupied lands. Thousands of
police were mobilized Tuesday
evening to enforce curfews in
Arab towns in Israel.

Arabs reported that demonstra-
tors took to the streets in some

areas and that Israeli troops fired
at the curfew violators. The eight
Arabs were wounded in the vil-
lage of Zaita, 40 miles northwest
of Jerusalem, the army and the
Palestine Press Service reported.

Palestinians in the territories
threw rocks and gasoline bombs.
Among the protesters reported
wounded was 13-year-old girl.

In Ramallah, small children
tossed rocks at each other in the
streets. They called the game
”Jews and Arabs.”

Drugs linked to fatal
train wreck in Md.

TOWSON, Md. — A former
Conrail engineer was sentenced
Tuesday to the maximum term of
five years in prison and fined
$1,000 for causing 16 deaths in
Amtrak’s worst train accident.

Rick L. Gates, 33, of Essex,
pleaded guilty Feb. 16 to the sin-
gle misdemeanor manslaughter
count and admitted in a state-
ment of facts to smoking mari-
juana on the train and failing to
make several safety checks that
might have prevented the ac-
cident.

Baltimore County Circuit Court
Judge Joseph P. Murphy said, ’’I
didn't think he was under the in-
fluence of marijuana.

”But what he did in terms of
failure to follow procedures was
to show us that he didn't give a
damn. He just didn't care,” the
judge said.

Gates and family membersin
the courtroom wept as prosecu-
tors read five victim impact state-
ments from relatives of those
killed in the crash.

THE PITT NEWS

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

Although spring football prac-
tice is only two days old, Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried knows a
few changes are going to be
made.

”We lost a lot of people from
last year's team,” Gottfried said.
”There are a number of spots still
open!’

Right now, most of those spots

Johnson
wins MVP
from team

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

Sophomore forward Lorri John-
son was voted the Lady Panthers’
Most Valuable Player for 1987-88
by her teammates this week.

Johnson, who averaged a team
high 14.6 points and 6.2 re-
bounds, led the women’s basket-
ball team to a 14-15 overall
record, and in the Big East, their
record was 5-11, putting them in
seventh place.

The Lady Panthers finished
7-21 overall and last in the league
with a 1-15 ledger the year
before.

”She was the player that kept
us in it at the end, the glue that
kept us together,” coach Kirk
Bruce said. ”Lorri was consistent
all year.”

Johnson sat out the 1986-87
season recovering from knee sur-
gery and also lost a year of eligi-
bility due to Proposition 48.

Bruce also named next year's
team captains — Shaunda Byrd,
Amy Holman and Jennifer
Shingler.

Holman, a 5-foot—11 junior for-
ward, averaged 3.2 points per
game.

Shingler, a 5-8 sophomore
guard, started all 29 games for
Pitt, averaging 9.9 points and 3.0
rebounds per game, and dished
out a team-high 101 assists.

And Byrd, a 5-6 junior guard,
averaged five points and three re-
bounds in 29 games, starting nine
of them.

’’I wanted two seniors and a
junior, so that next year we'd
have an experienced senior team
captain,” Bruce said.

M

are on defense.

The defensive backfield was hit
especially hard. Gone from last
season's team are starters Gary
Richard, Quintin Jones and Billy
Owens. That only leaves Troy
Washington and Cornell Holo-
way with extended time at the
position.

”There is no doubt that we
have lost a lot at the D-back po-
sition,” Gottfried said. ”But we
have good people waiting to get

their chance.”

A couple of changes involve
two players switching backfields.
Fullbacks Louis Riddick and Pren-
tiss Wright are the front-runners
to fill the job.

”Both guys wanted the
switch,” Gottfried said. "Louis
has always felt that he is better on
defense and Prentiss was recruit-
ed as a D-back. They were both
thrust onto offense out of neces-
sity last season. In fact, after the

Gottfried sees too many holes in defense

Bluebonnet Bowl was over, Louis
said to me, ‘Remember, I’m
switching to defense next year.’ ”
The linebacker position has lost
Zeke Gadson and Jerry Wall. The
top returner will be Jerry Ol-
savsky (101 tackles last season).
And Gottfried said that he has
been impressed with the early
play of sophomore Craig Gob.
’’I think that we will be all-
right,” Olsavsky said, ”because
I'm the most experienced mem-

ber out there right now, I have
been telling people where to go.
As practice starts to move on, the
other guys will start to pick up the
system. All of them know what is
going on, so it’s just a matter of
time.

”As the season rolls around,
everything will come together.
Once we get it going, we could
be better than last season. I don't
think that it’s a far-off goal,”Ol-

With two spring football
practices under their belt, the
last thing you would expect
from the Panthers would be
long-term goals.

The Panther defense, which
last season was the owner of
three shutouts, is looking
ahead to this season in hopes
that by year's end, the Pan-
thers will be reaping the divi-
dends of off-season workouts.

”We’re shooting to be the
number one defensive team in
the country,” said defensive
lineman Marc Spindler. ”We
have the goal to be number
one in total defense, shutouts,
yardage. We've had a good
showing in practice.”

But Panther head coach
Mike Gottfried is wary about
the defense and the lack of ex-
perience the team possesses.

”We have a lot of holes to
fill. We don't have the ex-
perience and strength we did
last season. We need to
rebuild,” said Gottfried, who

and Charles Swink to gradua-
tion, and Tony Siragusa, who
may undergo knee surgery
and would miss next season.

With Spindler’s progress
over the course of last season
— he started every game and
registered 106 tackles —~ he
should help ease the transition
stage.

”He keeps on getting better
and improving all the time,”
said Gottfried. ”You go either
one of two ways: you get bet-
ter or you stay the same. He’s

stressed the loss of Jon Carters’

Spindler sizes up
defense and looks
forward to season

obviously the kind of player
who keeps getting better.”

Spindler feels the incoming
freshman will be able to chip
in early and possibly make an
impact. ”I think they can come
in and show if they have it,
and from what I've heard, they
can. They might not come in
and start, but they can help us
win. These guys will come
through.”

Although Spindler presents
himself as a team player, his
personal goals gives him
something to strive for and
contribute to the team's total
cause.

’’I’d like to improve on my
pass rush,” said Spindler, who
was credited with 13 hurries
last season, but only one sack.
”I’d also like to reach 100
tackles, make All-East teams,
but basically to have a good
season and stay healthy.”

In retrospect, last season
was a stepping stone for this
season, particularly the loss to
Texas in the Bluebonnet Bowl.

"We put in a good season.
We weren't disappointed that
we lost, but grateful that we
got there. We have the ex-
perience of playing in a bowl
game.

”When we were there last
year, everyone was like ’What
do we do? What are we doing
here? What's going to happen
next?’ We had to prepare our-
selves. We know what it’s like
now and we know how to
deal with it. Next year we’ll go
and everyone will know how
to deal with it,” added
Spindler.

Final Four coaches ready for the challenge

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

In this, the 1988 Final Four
consisting of Arizona, Duke, Kan-
sas and Oklahoma, one coach
will be making his third
championship-round appear-
ance, two others their second,
and another, his very first.
Despite the respective amount of
appearances, all four are looking
to win their first national cham-

pionship.

Larry Brown of the Kansas Jay-
hawks, winners of the Midwest
regional, is the veteran of the
group, guiding a team to the
NCAA’s elite quartet for the third
time, all in the '80s.

In 1980, Brown led upstart
UCLA, the last team to be invit-
ed to the tournament that year, all
the way to the championship
game, where it lost to Louisville
53-51.

After a five-year hiatus, Brown
again emerged in the Final Four,
this time as mentor of the Kansas
Jayhawks. Kansas was eliminated
by Duke in the 1986 national
semifinal 71-67.

Now Brown will again direct
his underdog Jayhawks, 25-11,
against Duke, winner of the East
Regional.

Mike Krzyzewski of Duke is
appearing in the Final Four for the
second time, having been the

Blue Devils’ head coach in 1986.

Duke lost the national champi-
onship that year 72-69 to
Louisville.

Duke, 28-6, won the Atlantic
Coast Conference tournament
this year and upended the East
regional’s No. 1 seed, Temple, to
advance to the championship
round.

Arizona's Lute Olson also
reached the Final Four for the first
time in 1980, as then-head coach

of the Big 10's Iowa Hawkeyes.
Iowa was eliminated by Louis-
ville 80-72 that year. (Seems like
Louisville has plagued all these
guys at one time or another.)
Now in the Pac-10, Olson's
team captured the league's regu-
lar season and tournament cham-
pionships, then breezed through
the West regional, winning its
games by less than 20 points only
once, a 70-52 defeat of North

Caliguire finding life
in center to his liking
during spring practice

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

When senior Ed Miller played
his last football game for Pitt in
the Bluebonnet Bowl, the Pan-
thers were left without an ex-
perienced center.

Some may have been worried
that there wouldn't be anyone to
anchor the offensive line.

One of those who didn't wor-
ry was Pitt coach Mike Gottfried.
All he did was move guard Dean
Caliguire over one spot.

”Dean is a great athe|ete,”
Gottfried said. ”He should be
able to shore up the middle of
our line. I know what he is capa-
ble of, and I know he can handle
the job.”

Caliguire, a sophomore at Pitt,
is ready to take over the reins of
the position and keep the line
steady.

‘ 

I'll be called upon to
do a lot more than I did
last season, but that is
just part of the game —

Dean Caliguire

”I’m looking fomaiﬂtoflayingsﬁ

center this season," taligufre
said. ”The guys around me are
good players, so that should help
my transition.

”You know that guys like Mark
Stepnoski are going to rock some
people. My teammates help me
out.”

Last season, Caliguire was a
key man in a Panthers offensive
line that sprung Craig Heyward
for 1,791 yards.

”There is definitely a lot more
pressure on me at center,”
Caliguire said. ”l’|l be called
upon to do a lot more than I did
last season, but that is just part of
the game."

Caliguire spent last spring

5».

/

working at center when Miller
was out with an injury, so the po-
sition isn't entirely new to him.
But it will still be an adjustment.

”The first two days I have fallen
a little behind the rest of the
line,” Caliguire said. ’’I just have
to keep a positive attitude about
it and keep on working.

’’I also know that the coaches
have faith in me. They wouldn't
do anything to hurt the team. By
putting me in there, I know that
they are giving me a vote of con-
fidence.” '

Although he has the most ex-
perience at center of any player
on the team, Caliguire admits it
isn't too much.

”I played about half of spring
practice last season at center and

a little bit my sophomore year. It's "

not that much, but I am confident
in my abilities. I know if I keep
on working I'll be all right.

’’I worked on the small things
over the summer. I took a lot of
time working on my footwork
and snapping the ball. I think my
practice has gotten me ready for
the spring,” Caliguire said.

With the exceptional spring
play of offensive guard Chris
Goetz, Caliguire should be able
to concentrate fully in the center.

’’I think Dean will be very good
for our line,” guard Mark Step-
noski said. ”It’s not like he has
never-played there before, so the
position i§n’t fiew. Goetz has
been a force this spring, so our
line should be strong this year.

”We have been playing around
a little bit with the option. I don't
think we'll run as much this year,
but the line will still be counted
on,” Stepnoski said.

With the possibility of a mobile
quarterback this season, the
offensive line will be counted on
even more to keep up with their
blocks.

’’I’m looking forward to the
season," Caliguire said. ”We’ll
probably open up the offense a
little more this season. That real-
ly doesn't bother me. We just
have to get the job done."

and finish at 15-6, but they must
now reevaluate their goals after
the loss to the Owls. Could the
Panthers have taken Temple, a

Co—captain Campbell says
maybe. .

”They were a lot tougher than

lamented Campbell. ”A lot of

Campbell also indicated that
Temple was by far the toughest

The Lady Panthers traveled to

going into the competition but
wound up an unexpected fifth
with a 179.90 point total.

’’It was disappointing because
we worked so hard for this

didn't have a good meet either.”

"Our vaults were fairly good,

and the vault scores were conser-

were real nice. We had some
trouble on bars, and for the most
part, our floor routines were real-
ly nice,” Yohman said.

Chiefs take 4th—round
pick for Blackledge;
becomes new Steeler

By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

(AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers,
seeking to improve the NFL’s
worst passing attack, acquired
quarterback Todd Blackledge
from the Kansas City Chiefs on
Tuesday for a fourth—round pick
in next month's draft.

”|’m ecstatic,” said Blackledge,
a former Penn State quarterback
and the son of Steelers’ offensive
line coach Ron Blackledge.

The trade marks just the second
the Steelers have made for a quar-
terback during Chuck No|l’s 19
seasons as coach. The Steelers

‘obtained David Woodley from
the Miami Dolphins for a third-
round pick in February 1984.

Before the trade could be com-
pleted, Blackledge had to reach
an agreement with the Chiefs on
a new contract. He became a free
agent in February after making
$450,000 last season, the last un-
der his former contract.

Blackledge won the Chiefs’
starting job in trading camp but
asked to be traded shortly after
new Chiefs coach Frank Gansz
benched him and replaced him
with Bill Kenney just two weeks
into the season.

The 6-foot-3, 219-pound Black-
ledge has completed 364 of 742
passes, 49.1 percent, for 4,510

yards, 26 touchdowns and 32 in-
terceptions in five NFL seasons.
In three 1987 games, he was 15
of 31 for 154 yards, one touch-
down and one interception.

Blackledge, 27, was the second
quarterback selected and the
seventh player drafted overall
during the QB—rich NFL draft af-
ter leading Penn State to the 1982
national championship. Other
quarterbacks drafted on the first
round that season included John
Elway, Jim Kelly, Tony Eason,
Ken O'Brien and Dan Marina.

The Steelers, 8-7, lost their fi-
nal two games and missed the
playoffs last year as quarterback
Mark Malone endured the worst
of his eight NFL seasons. Malone
was the league's lowest-rated

‘ quarterback —— his QB rating was

46.7, compared to league leader
Joe Montana's 102.1 —— and
threw only one touchdown pass
and 11 interceptions in the final
seven weeks of the season.

Malone completed 156 of 336
passes for 1,896 yards, six touch-
downs and an AFC-leading 19 in-
terceptions as the Steelers passed
for an NFL-low 2,266 yards.

Blackledge will duel with Ma-
lone, third-year pro Bubby Brister
and Steve Bono, a former Min-
nesota Vikings’ backup, for the
Steelers’ starting job.

Although there are players fill-
ing the positions at this point, the
incoming freshman class will
play a big part in the Panthers’
defense.

”With the coaching change
and everything, our classes got a
little out of wack,” Gottfried said.
”We only have something like
nine seniors on the team. We
don't have a lot of depth at this
point. The freshmen will have to
be able to step in and play.”

The offense will have a differ-
ent Iook this season as well. The
return of running back Brian Da-
vis should help take the place of
Craig Heyward.

’’I think we'll try to open up our
offense a little bit this season,”
Gottfried said. ”The only
problem now is that Darnell
won't be able to practice all

try different things. But no matter
who emerges as the starter, I have

”We have a young squad right
now, so only time will tell. Our
practices have been very intense.
Everybody is looking forward to
the season," Gottfried said.
