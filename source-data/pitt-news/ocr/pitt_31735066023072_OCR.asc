The residence hall cafeteria
management expressed amaze-
ment and dismay over charges
made by students that the cafeteria
food is both “unsuitable and
unsanitary”. _
“I am amazed that this occureed
so early in the year before they
have a real feel for the food,” said
Ted Kokladas, cafeteria manager,
in response to the charges levied "by
students ' at y Tuesday’s
-Government -Board meeting.
Confplaints about broken glass-

Study less, improve your grades. -

That's the claim made by many
advertisements for speedreading
courses, porported to offer
students a myriad of beneﬁts,
including better reading compre-
hension, higher, grade point
averages, and more free- time.

But do speedreading courses
really deliver whatthey promise?

One problem that arises, accord-
ing to Jane Leavy, a reading
specialist with the'Learning Skills
Center, is the different connota-
tions which surround the term
‘speedreading’. V

“Some people are turned off by
it. They think they can't handle
it,” Leavy said. “Others expect
toomuch from it.”

Leavy teaches speedreading
courses at the Learning Skills
Center for $5 per six week session
Right now, six ‘speedreading
courses are being conducted by the
center. All are filled.

“The courses are open to any
Pitt person——student, faculty, or
staff,” Leavy said. n ,

The course is “very practically
oriented” Leavy said, and can
apply to “all levels of material.”

to 400-500 “ﬁnal demand” '

said. Reading can become a “more

What do graduates of speedread-
ing courses have to say about it?
Several ‘students were asked if they
found their courses helpful.
Answers ranged from “the tech-

niques can help‘ you grasp the»

Mary Grace Diana, who ~is

_ ByPATRlCIA LANGFORD
Pitt News Staffwriter ‘

The situation in Nicaragua
appears tobe headed in a positive
according to "Harold
Sims, associate professor of history

at Pitt. .

In a lecture yesterday at the
World Affairs Council noon‘ brief-
ing, Sims commented on some of
the prevalent conditions of Nicar-

I agua today.

Of the provisional government,
Sims said that there seemed to be

,_ “a good sampling of all the

people”, 50 percent of which were
businessmen.
Government members‘ are will-

’ ’ page 2--Friday), September.-28," 1979  ,

ing to support a mixed economy, he
said, and every member is in favor,
of international investment and V
aid.

There is also a keen desire to
have relations with the United
States," he said. \

Sims also commented on the
leniency the provisional govern-
ment has shown to the media. For
thirty days after the government
took control of the media, he said,_
but now they are free to go their
own way. A

The death penalty has been
abolished,‘ he added, and as of
August 21, a Bill of Rights went
into effect for all people except

those in prisons. After sixty days,
however, the bill will apply to
prisoners.

At the moment, 25 percent of the
people are homeless and 45 percent
dependent upon food given out by
the Red Cross. Between 30 and 60
percent of all the major cities are
destroyed and half the population
is out of work.

“Somoza’s withdrawal from the

country practically destroyed the —

1’

economy, said Sims.
Rebuilding the cities is a must,
he added, before society can be
restored.
According to Sims, the provision-
al government is only able to

;

~

allocate funds to small business-
men and so the big businessman
must look to international aid for
funds to rebuild commercial
centers.

"There seems to be reluctance on
the part of other countries to give
aid to Nicaragua, Sims said. So far,
the present aid given to the
Nicaraguans is much less than it
was after the 1972 earthquake.

Costa Rica and other surround-
ing countries are giving teachers

and doctors as aids Sims added.

East Germany is aiding Nicaragua
by taking injured revolutionary
soldiers back to East Germany for
* medical care and presently, the

Nicaragua Recovering From Devastating Revolution

Carter administration is working on
a bill to lend Nicaragua $100
million. _

Of the refugees, Sims said that
500 are returning daily from Costa

'Rica, and in a great abundance

from other countries. Also many of
the . refugees are illiterate, and
none of the children are immuniz-
ed. -

Overall, Sims .. stressed the
importance of U.S. aid to Nicara-
gua.

‘,‘Things are very hopeful,” he :1

said. We should aid this new
government and continue to buy
products bought under the Somoza
administration.’ ’

Authorities Approve Proposal‘ For More BusMoney i

By CYNTHIA COHEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

The results are in from last
week’s state Senate Committee
on Transportation hearings
where a proposal by Sen.
James A. Romanelli (D-South

transit -authorities was dis-
cussed.

Most authorities reacted

ence.”

Student food preference, Kok-
ladas noted, helps to determine the
daily menu items.

“We look for items that are
equally balanced in popularity so

- example, roast beef on a particular

transit systems incur—figured
over the previous ﬁscal year’s
ﬁgures——before the beginning
of the new year.- -

“That’s a piece of legislation
that we would support,” said
Tom Carpenter of Allegheny I
County's Port Authority. “We
need a predictable level of
funding.”

Currently, transit authorities
do not know how much funding
the state will give until the J uly‘
1-June36 ﬁscal year is three-

night.”

Preference and production re-
cords, not cost, again are factors in
eliminating or keeping menu items,
said Gil Kinderman, food service
coordinator.

“It doesn’t beneﬁt us to serve
anything not acceptable to the
student-not if it ends up in the
garbage.”

“The funding’ increase and

A spokesman for South

would aid us greatly in our

“The real test will be when I
introduce the legislation to the

Romanelli said after the hear-

starting to realize we need to
take a longer and harder look at
mass transit, not just .at the
state’s highways.” '

Romanelli said he doubted if

“We could increase the_

students have gone to Ecuador,
Brazil and Venezuela.

After being selected to partici-

study of the history, geography,

“Life is really different down

very structured. There is a- lot of
control over kids, but whatal didn’t

For example, ifa child was playing
around a cabinet and about to
break something, the father would

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer
A revised student handbook

l — listing virtually every program and .

service offered to undergraduates
by the University . was released
earlier this month by Bob Firth,

 

Student Programs.

The handbook came as a result of
a_ charge given Firth’s office to
develop a student information and
referral network and produce a new
student handbook.

 

Featured in the book are 200
diversified entries, including a
detailed diagram of the Trees Hall
athletic complex, a guide to the
Port Authority Transit system and
guidelines for academic programs
and majors.

“All of the ways that students
can get involved with intramurals
or the varsity sports at Pitt are
listed in theihandbook,” Firth said.

There were 7,000 copies of the
handbook printed this year, an 80
percent increase over last year.

Activities at Pitt's 1979 Career Seminar Series will be winding down,today»alter a week of workshops, seminars and display tables in the’Student
' Union representing virtually every.type of career, and graduate school option available to students. The seminar was sponsored by Pitt s Coun-

seling Service. .

book Distributed to New Students With l.D. 

Firth said he hopes to increase the '

availability of the publication to
students next year.

Firth said he doesn’t see the
improved handbook as any kind of
publicity ploy for the University.

“The best P.R. is reality and I
certainly don't believe in fake
P.R.,” Firth said. “The best P.R.
for the Universityis letting it speak
for itself, and in this case I think it
speaks pretty well for itself.”

Firth said development of a
student information and referral

center would be a .sort of living.«‘__-ty,_A

student handbook.

“A student information and
referral center would be putting the
information in a form that students

could give to other students, which ‘
would be giving it the human ‘

element,” Firth said. "‘I would_like
to see thisbe the start of a new
sensitivity in the organization of
information in the University.”

Half-Baked

S Cafeteria?

The members of the Student Government Board
wrestled with another of those profound and difficult
issues that seem to overwhelm its agenda every week.

V’ Complaints about the quality of food and

management of the residence hall cafeteria was the
problem dormitory students brought to SGB. With
their usual tact and depth of thought, SGB members
voted unanimously to endorse the students’ work and

~ aid them with their presentation to administration

officials. - « I
True, it may not sound like the most earth shaking

news to happen at Pitt, but to the some 4,000 resident"

students the question of the quality of the food most
of them are served every day is a crucial one—impor-
ta_nt as a decision about new requirements for
engineering majors, or an investigation into possible

improprieties surrounding a standardized test for"

nurses. Mundane problems like inadequate cafeterial
service can make life for students more unbearable

 

./ than things more central to academics, such as the
teaching ability of professors or class size.
Representatives of the 1,200 students who signed a
petition protesting the quality of food in the cafeteria
presented a long list ’of deficiencies in service, in-
cluding cold or uncooked food, too much starchy and
fatty food, an unvaried menu, chipped glassware,
pieces of bone and other fragments in" meat, and sour
milk in dispensing machines. No matter how‘ hard
University food. service and catering service managers
try to attribute the problem to unfortunate and 0c’-

. cassional oversights that occur when a cafeteria ‘tries

to serve meals for over 4,000 students, someone’ must
recognize there is a problem when almost one-third
of dormitory students have expressed dissatisfaction.
,According to a disgruntled forme__r_ morning
manager for the Towers cafeteria, part of the
problem with the food service might be with Key
Management, (the cafeteria’s catering service) and
the way it handles employees. The fermer manager
said in an interview that he and others were
dissatisfied "because the people from" Key
Management would never give raises to students who
had worked in the cafeteria several years and never

Page 6—Friday, September 28, 1979};

increased the hours of students with seniority so they
could earn more money. Certainly, if the catering
service treats student employees in such a manner
they cannot have help, that is putting its heart into
the job. .

Even more disturbing are the reports of incorrect
handling of meats that the former manager claimed
to have occurred in the cafeteria. He said ground
meat to be used later in the day was left thawing at
room temperature in the stock room. A “I had to be
careful I didn’t knock the dolly the meat was on or
blood spilled all over the floor,” he said. Allowin 

such conditions.to exist does not sound like thelac.-"“"

tions of a catering company that is doing an out-
standing job.

Students should use the proper channels like com-
plaining to the Food Service Committee, and Univer-
sity food‘service’employee‘s, but in this case it seems
the question of food quality is important enough that

‘there should be a full and public hearing into the '

matter by the Student Affairs beyond an in-
vestigation, the administration must be willing to
change the status quo, and find a replacement for the
current catering service if necessary.

Perhaps I am a ‘_‘deplorable”

manner. I suppose the various,

statements in my letter. So far,

-they have not really responded.

I‘ did not attack the frats. In fact.
I said that the showing of porno
ﬂicks on campus was more a
symptom of a problem than the
problem itself. I think the real
problem is alienation on campus.
How many students are drug-using

"manic-depressives who are con-

stantly under too much pressure?
I know countless others.‘
That was the point of my letter. In

, light of the recent a'ticles on the

many students agree that life on
campus is largely a drag. ,

All the frats could ‘say in
response was that I am confused
and that they are really quite
saintly. In fact, great American
heroes come from fraternities. The

Klu Klux Klan started out as a‘

Are they concerned with the quality

Business New

Dual M CZJOI‘
Although most of the questions
raised by the Sept. 17’Pitt News

article concerning the dual major in .

business option for CAS students
will be answered in a forthcoming
brochure, I would like to clarify
several points.

The dual major in business is a
CAS program requiring a CAS
major and a business major. ,A
dual-major student will remain a

CAS student and ‘earn a CAS

degree, not a business degree.
JgThus, there will be no formal _
V application to become a student int-T

the business -school.

However, since only about 200

‘students (mostly sophomores and

some juniors) may begin the dual
major option each year, it may be
necessary toselect the‘ students
who may participate in the-major if
the number of interested students
exceeds the enrollment limit. ‘
Contrary to an impression that
may have been created in the
article, if such a situation develops,
a CAS/GSB committee will select
dual majors from’ the pool of

students, who have formally?‘

declared their‘ interest in -the
program, on the basis of overall
QPA, courses taken, and grades
earned. ' '

I encourage anyone, especially
freshmen and sophomores, who is
interested in more information
about the dual major in business to
attend the orientation sessions to
be announced soon in The Pitt
News. or pick up afcopy of a
brochure describing the program in
the CAS Advising Center (909 CL)
after Oct. 1.

" team back to reality.

By JEFF DUROSKO

‘ Asst. Pitt News Sports Editor

. The Pantherette volleyball team '

will ﬁnd out just how much their
recent west coast tour will help
their game when the Pitt Invita-

_ tional begins tonight.

“The team is pretty conﬁdent
about the tournament,” said head
coach Mike Hebert. “‘They feel
like they've weathered through the
tough matches with the really’,

1 strong teams out west.”‘

The 16-te‘a_m_, tournament will

 

 

5:‘

/

feature teams from ‘all over the

east, including last year’s Eastern
Regional runnersup (to Pitt)
Rutgers. Also in the ﬁeld will be
Pitt rivals Maryland, Penn State,_
Temple and Georgetown.
“There’s no doubt that Rutgers
will pose the biggest challenge to
ourwinning the tournament,” said
Hebert. “Last year they did well
with our winning the tournament,”
said Hebert. “Last year they did

‘well with a very young team and

they have been playing together

Sp art 5 

 

V

year round ever since.”.

Pitt will play, its ﬁrst match
tonight against Howard University
and then square off with Suny
Buffalo. Pool play will conclude
tomorrow when Pitt faces Penn
State. a . ,

“I’ve never seen Howard before
and Buffalo is usually a few notches
below us,” said Hebert. “Penn
State will provide the major
competition in our pool.”

The top three teams in each pool
will advance toa single elimination

/

playoff while the fourth place tea

will go home. -'
“I think we should make -it to the

finals but it mostly depends on how

strong Rutgers is,” said Hebert.

“The big question is of us having
not played anybody from the east.
We’ll find out just how much
difference there is between the east
and west.’.’

The Pitt Invitational if generally
considered to be one of the biggest
tournaments in the east. and the
Pantherettes are looking forward to

it, according to the coach. _

“I think the team has really felt
away from home—like they were
always in somebody else’s back-
yard,” said Hebert. “We’rereally-
relieved to be back home.”

SPIKER’S NOTES: The Howard
match will begin‘at 6 p.m. and
Buffalo at 8:30 p.m.  Pitt will
square off against Penn State at
10:15 a.m. Saturday The
Pantherette’s record is 2-8-3

Tomorrow night at Veterans’

. Stadium in Philadelphia, the Pitt

football team will begin a stretch of
games designed to lift it back into
the Top 20 with consideration for a
more glamorous bowl game.
After Temple, the Panthers
return home for two games with
Cincinnati and Boston College,
neither of which resembles a major
college football team. This soft
spot in the schedule should propel
Pitt .to a 5-1 record in time for the
October 20 trip to Washington.
With a 5-1 mark, and competing
with a team the caliber of
Washington, Pitt could move back
up the ladder.
~ How do the Panthers stack up for
the remainder of the season, and
what can they expectto achieve

1 after last week’s disappointing loss
at North Carolina?

-Right now, Pitt appears-"destined
to ﬁnish much the same way it did
last year, with an 8-3 or 7-4 record
After the Kansas
game, it seemed Pitt was capable
of challenging for Top 10 honors,
but last week’s game brought the

Many people feel
schedule is a liability because it
lacks numerous quality opponents.

reason, you must beat other highly

' necessarily the case.

good team—Clemson-—and- man-

the Pitt ‘

State this year, ‘the Lions are
currently ranked 18th, after" last
week’s loss. to Texas A&M.

.-Playing Nebraska at Lincoln

tomorrow, PSU_ figures to be 1-2 by
late in the afternoon. That will also
guarantee their departure from the
ranks of college football's elite, the,
Top 20.

What this means is—it doesn’t
matter who you play and how badly
you beat them, the onlyfact that
matters, is the won-lost record.
There can be no doubt that the 1977
Pitt squad was capable of playing"
any team in the country, but two
losses (Notre Dame and , Penn

State) wiped out any chance of a ‘

major bowlclash with a highly-r.e-
garded opponent.

Everybody would have liked to
have_ seen Pitt play eventual
national champion Notre Dame
with a healthy Matt Cavanaugh,
and it is “quite true ‘that the
Panthers would have given the
Irish a much better game than the
Texas Longhorns, a team which
entered the Cotton Bowl top-rank-
ed and undefeated.

But this is 1979, and if Pitt wants
to return to its glory days of three
years ago, it -must blow out the

/-likes of Temple, Boston College

and’ Cincinnati, and beat either
Washington or Penn State. Penn
State is certainly not the team they
were last year, and the Panthers
will have to do more than make a
good showing in defeat.

The Pitt women’s tennis team
raised its record to 2-1 following a
convincing 7-2 victory over Indiana
University of Pennsylvania on
Wednesday. Coach ‘Louise. Rick
called the match an “excellent
warm-up” to the Penn State
Invitational this weekend.

Randi Belkin and Cathy Jacob-
son remain a consistent one-two
punch, as both raised their
individual records to 3-0. Belkin

After four defeats by a single
goal and one tie game under their
belts, the Pantherbooters go into

University. With a 0-4-1 record to
show for their efforts, the boaters
are ﬁnding it difﬁcult not to

the season. The latest of Pitt°s
defeats came Wednesday when the
Panthers fell prey to nearby CMU,
2-1. This was the second time the
Panthers lost the game by within
the ﬁnal 15 seconds of the contest.

Pitt took control early _in the
game. With only 18 ‘minutes
elapsed in the initial half,
freshmanwing Eric Tiedtke scored
his first goal of the regular season.
After Bob Hughes took a pass from
Tom Kunkel he turned and found

minutes gone in the second half.
CMU’s George Canepa passed to
teammate R'oland’Simon who got»
past Panther goalkeeper Mark

Regulation time ended with two
good shots on goal by Panthers Jeff .

shot hit thecrossbar and tipped
over instead of into the net.
Rebounding "the shot was mid-
ﬁelder Trempus whose shot went
just wide.

Then the problems began. As
usual, the Panthers were dominat-

overtime, however, CMU was not
about to settle for a tie. The
Tartans’ Bob Messmer scored, and
it was Pitt defeat number four.
