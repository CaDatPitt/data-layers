Groups protest tuition reimbursement for presidents

  Increase in AIDS reported

The Pitt News

Outraged by the plan to reimburse
Student Government Board presi-
dents’ tuition costs with student activ-
ities fee dollars, campus groups are
organizing to protest.

“We think it’s a misuse of Student
Activities money and we don’t think
students should be made to pay for
the plan.'The fact that it’s being fund-
ed by activities fee dollars + that’s

really offensive,” Chair of newly creat-
ed Committee to Rally against
Presidential Perks Rob Lewis said.

The controversy began when it was
announced the presidents of College
of General Studies,
Government Board and the Graduate
and Professional Student Association
would be reimbursed for the price of
12 undergraduate credits.

"According to the plan, half of the
money will be provided "by the
administration, while the other half
will come from Student Activities

Student '

 among African-Americans

\

.\

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

The Allegheny County Health
Department reported-an alarming
increase of new AIDS cases among
African—Americans and a plausible
decline of new cases amid white
homosexual and bisexual men.

These are the results released by a
health department investigation on
the county’s incidents of AIDS and
other sexually transmissible diseases.

The study showed that African-
Americans, approximately 13 percent
of the counties population, now
account for more than one-third’ of

/all new AIDS cases — totalling 41 of
the 114 diagnosed last year, com-
pared to 7 percent, or 13 of 94,‘ in
1988. _

The case load among white homo-
sexual and bisexual men over the
same period, numerically and pro-
portionally, decreased from 79 cases,
or 85 percent, of the total in 1988 to

'3‘ 72 cases, or 65 percent, reported last

yeah

“The AIDS decline among whites
occurred primarily in homosexual
and bisexual men, suggesting that
education and prevention programs
are working in the white, gay com-
-munity,” County Health Director Dr.
Bruce Dixon said.

“The dramatic increasepamong,

blacks, however, tells another story
and demonstrates a compelling need
for new strategies targeting not only
minorities but white heterosexual as
well with more effective messages to,
discourage risk-taking behaviors,”

he said. -

Guillermo Cole, public information
officer for Allegheny County Health
Department, said trained profession-
als need to educate the "minorities
about AIDS through outreach pro-
grams and individual counseling.

“The HIV infections are declining
among homosexuals and bisexuals
because the communication is more
effective, and there is an awareness
about promiscuous intercourse,” Cole
said. _

Karen ,Reddick,._.th£:...minority coor-
dinator of Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force, suggested that the alarming
spread of AIDS through the African-
American community resulted from a
lack of education. She said the
media—created images prompted the
community to assume that the virus
was only diagnosed among white
homosexuals. .

“The perceived message was if

you’rr not gaylthen you .weren’t,

going to get it,” said Reddick. “And
this is what people really believed.”
At Pitt, the AIDS cases are not as
prevalent_ as the county’s rate.
“Students know how AIDS is trans-
mitted, but they don’t do what they
know,” said Jan Devoe, clinic manag-

er at Forbes Clinic. She said students_
‘still avoid ' using condoms and

abstaining from sex. ..

The study also cited tenaciously
high rates in other sexually transmit-
ted diseases. Gonorrhea declined
slightly to 4,396 cases last year from
a record high 4,509 cases in 1990.
This year the disease is projected to
reach about 4,000 cases, still indicat-
ing a high level of sexual risk-taking,

Fees.

Lewis said he spoke with represen-
tatives of the Campus Women’s
Organization, College Republicans,
College Democrats, Students for Life,
Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Alliance
and Amnesty International, none of
whom are supportive of the plan, he
said.

“We’re not happy about paying for
someone else’s tuition," University
Democrats President Shawn McClern
said.

McClern said that he is upset that

the University Democrats’ budget was
gutted in the process and that hurts
during an election year.

Kevin Docherty, president of Pitt’s
College Republicans, said that this is a
“blatant misuse of power.”

“We are working together with our

fiercest political enemies. We are all

students and we’re getting screwed by
it,” Docherty said.

Co—President of BiGALA, Todd
Kinavey, said that the university does
need to encourage more people to

 Pitt seniors score low on nationwide educational study

Byjason Hillman
Editor in Chief

Seniors at Pitt tend to be less
involved in the university com-
munity than at other universities
nationwide.

The Student Developmental
Task and Lifestyle Inventory, a
survey handed out to resident
hall students last year, showed
that Pitt seniors scored signifi-
cantly lower on the Educational

Involvement Subtask, which
gauged students’ educational
experience and goals.

One thousand questionnaires
were passed out, of which there
were 512 acceptable responses.
The survey showed that Pitt
seniors scored low in every sub-
scale, topics in which students
were asked to rate themselves.
Topics included career plan-
ning, life management and cul-
tural participation. Sophomores

and juniors basically matched
up with national norms, but
first-year students scored higher
than average in some areas.

At a meeting of the Division
of Student Affairs Assessment
Team on Monday, Ihembers dis-
cussed the impact and validity
of the survey, along with possi-
ble future actions on the subject
of the survey. '

Createdlast year, this was the
task force’s first meeting of the

school year. “We started out
with looking at the quality of
services that we offered to stu-
dents through the division of
Student Affairs,” Vice Chancellor
of Student Affairs William
Harmon said. “Then [we]
changed somewhat the focus by
deciding to look at the develop-
ment process of students. To
make sure that if we offer a ser-
vice, that developmentally, they
know how to use the service.

As a result, this is what we’ve
had, in terms of using a stan-
dardized survey.” _

Opinions differed on the
value of the survey.

“Any survey or any data that
you try to interpret, you have
some questions,” Harmon said.
“And you want to make sure
that what you have is informa-
tion that you can, use. Even if it
is a snapshot, it is asnapshot of

Even ifyou're not counting the years to
retirement, you can count on TIAA-CREF
to help you build the future you deserve-
with flexible retirement and tax-deferred
annuity plans, a diverse portfolio ofinvest-
ment choices, and a record of personal

Over a million people in education and

Not when you realize that your retirement

to live at least as comfortably then as you
do now. And that takes planning.

By starting to save now, you can take
advantage of tax-deferral and give your

Pitt's oldest extracurrict-llar

By Mike Laughlin

Staﬂ‘ Writer

It is Pitt’s oldest extracurricular activity,
yet members of the Men’s Glee Club said
they feel they get little attention or
response from the students.

“I’m surprised that at a university this
large, there isn’t more participation,” Kris
Rust, graduate student ‘in musicology and
the club’s director, said.

Donald Young, senior and the club’s
president, said he had the same feelings.

“It’s  older than football by a couple of
years,” he said.

According to the club’s official history, it
was formed in 1890. It originally consisted
of eight students who got together and
called themselves the Banjo and Mandolin
Club.

As time went on, it came to be known
as the Men’s Glee Club, although mem-
bership has not increased much through-
out its 100 years of existence. It usually
has no more than,2O to 30 members at a
time.

“There’s plenty of openings,” senior and
alumni liaison for the club, Rich Koval
said. P

Young said that the club serves mainly

as a diversion. Most of the members have

previous experience in high school cho-

ruses but none are music majors, accord-

ing to Young. . ‘ .
Membership in the club can also count

toward credit for graduation. Young
describes the club as popular with seniors
for this reason.

“It was an easy credit and it still is,” he
said. .

At regular meetings, members usually
perform both physical and vocal warm-up
exercises. They roll their heads and
shoulders, shake their arms, slowly stand
up and stretch their arms toward the ceil-
ing, take deep breaths and massage their

' jaws.

After this, the group goes through some
vocal exercises. They hum and then sing
some basic notes. "

“The warm-ups are intended to develop
musical and vocal skills,” Rust said. The
physical exercises are to help members
loosen up and relax, and the vocal exer-
cises get them ready to sing and listen
carefully.”

The club holds two large concerts a
couple of weeks before the end of the fall
and spring terms, according to Young.
Both are held at the Frick Fine Arts
Building on Sundays at 5 p.m.

The club members don’t play any
instruments, except for one nonmember

who plays piano for them. Young said‘

they sing in four—part harmony in concert,
and they sing a wide variety of music that
ranges from barber shop blues to gospel
to contemporary.

Young said the end—of—term concerts
usually get a large alumni tumout. He also

said that the club does many outside per-
formances, such as at rotary clubs, Pitt
alumni clubs, women’s colleges and
singing the National Anthem at Pirates’
and Penguins’ games.

The club also performs at pre-game lun-
cheons for the chancellor and has done
charity concerts on behalf of the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Touring the
world is also a part of the performance
schedule.

BiGALA co-president resigns

By Jason Hillman
Editor in‘ Chief

BiGALA co-President Linda
Jarrett resigned from her posi-
tion at a meeting last Friday.

Jarrett, whose term technically
ended in May, declined to stay
at her position when BiGALA
recently voted to extend the co-
presidents’ term for another cou-
ple of weeks.

“Maybe the reason I left is I
feel right now I can accomplish
more outside-of BiGALA for this
time period,” Jarrett said.

“I explained to everybody that
I will fulfill every obligation I
made, carry through projects I
have already started but just not
take on any new responsibility
for this time.”

Part of the problem involves
the current BiGALA constitution,
in which the co—presidents’ term
runs from through the regular
school year.‘ 0

Over the summer there is a
committee that runs the organi-
zation but doesn’t have official
leadership.

“The organization outgrew the
Constitution,” Jarrett said. “For
the next three weeks people are
working on the Constitution.
Anybody that wants to be a part
of BiGALA can show up at
those meeting and give their
input.”

Jarrett said that she is still a

part of BiGALA.

“When it comes right down to
it, what I want to see is a con-
tinuation of the Bisexual Gay
and Lesbian Alliance.

‘'1 really feel BiGALA must
exist, its role on campus is too
important to loose,” Jarrett said.

“Hopefully this vacancy will
give an opportunity for new
voices to have a say in the
direction of the organization,"
she said.

“I still want to do work with
BiGALA because I think it’s
important, but at this time in my
life, if I’m going to be
spokesperson for an organiza-
tion I want to make sure that
that organization is living up to
its mission, so I think that basi-
cally because IBiGALAI is going
through a metamorphosis right
now, I feel I can accomplish a
lot more as a member and as an
individual outside of BiGALA for
gay, lesbian, bisexual issues and
for issues that concern all stu-
dents,” Jarrett said.

Elections for_both co—presi—
dents will be on Friday at the
regular business meeting in the
BiGALA office on the fifth floor
of the Union.

“Right now I think that I want
to provide support and empower
people that need it and help cul-
tivate leadership in those that
want to take a more active role
on campus,” Jarrett said.

“This is a program
where, although every-
body is alike, the students
differ wildly in intelli-
gence, functionalities and
backgrounds, so we con-

volunteers and started up
the program.

“That was basically the
beginning of our program
in 1980, just four volun-
teers,” she said.

The program currently
has approximately 25 vol-
unteers at WPIC and
needs more to help all of
the students waiting.

“We are always looking
for interested volunteers
to help out here at
Western Psych,” Evans
said.

Volunteer tutors are

asked to attend a short
workshop before getting
matched with a student.
“We’re trying to give the
students a good experi-
ence, but the tutors should
get a good experience too.
The program is celebrating
international literacy week
Sept. 8 - 15.

both the student and the
tutor,” Evans said.

that particular time and as far as I’m con-
cerned, it’s valid. It’s information that can
be used because this is how the students
responded.”

The test, developed at the University of
Georgia by Roger Winston, is usually

administered one—on-one by an academic '

advisor, but the tests were given to resi-
dence hall staff, who went to students’
doors. .

“We did not have the luxury of doing
that because [academic advisors] don’t

report to us. Secondly, we wanted to get a I

bigger snapshot than just what one per-
son’s problems were. We wanted to get a
group picture if we could,” Vice Pres-
ident of Student Affairs Dennis Donham
said. _

The meeting led to discussion about
future data-gathering possibilities.

“The academic life of the student, the
social life of the student, the emotional life

of the studentand the financial life of the
student are intertwined. That is necessary,
that is natural and we might as well recog-
nize it.  Let’s go and collect information
that deals with all those areas, use what
we can use directly, pass the other infor-
mation on to people who it obviously
impacts  and See if we can get working
together on these things,” Jon'Conlogue,
assistant director of residence life, said.
“What we’re trying very hard to do is accu-
rately assess what is going on with our stu-
dents, developmentally and that is a very
difficult thing to do,” Donham said.
“Because most of us now feel very strong-
ly that we’re a unique kind of institution
with unique students, with unique con-
cerns and somebody else’s questionnaire
isn’t going to help us that much.

Protest

Continued from page I
run for SGB positions, but’ this is not the
right way to go about it.

“I feel that better use can be made of
student activity money,” Kinavey said.
“Students should be given some voice. I
think we will all be a lot stronger if we
work together on this.”

“We are opposed to it, and we are
going to protest in some form,” Kinavey
said.

However, not all of the government
groups are pleased with the plan either.

The presidents of the GPSA and CGS
are not accepting the entire undergradu-
ate tuition reimbursement that is being
offered by the university administration.

Only SGB President Gil. Golden said
he is in favor of the plan. Golden said it

~ will open up student government to

those who can not afford to work there
now because they must work to pay for
school as well.

“We may be missing out on quality
leadership out there because [the stu-
dents] may be going elsewhere where
they get more benefits, and we lose stu-
dents to the work force,” Golden said.

But Lewis said the campus groups are
not angry with Golden for accepting the

tuition, they are opposing anddisturbed.

with the reimbursement plan itself.

“I can’t’really fault [the presidents] for
taking money, it’s a great temptation.
The fault here is in the people who initi-
ated this plan and voted it in,” Lewis
said. ’

GPSA President Steve Parks is not
accepting any of the tuition reimburse-
ment.

“We’re not interested in making the
GPSA presidency this imperial thing,
we’re just interested in using GPSA to

promote graduate school interests,”
Parks said.

Parks said, “There are a lot of student
leaders on campus who do just as much
or more work than any student govern-
ment people, and they don’t get paid.”

Parks said that giving someone tuition
dollars does not get the‘ best people
involved.

“They might as well call [SGB] a Greek
Week election. Instead of pumping
money into the Black Action Society,
Campus Women’s Organization, Bisexual
Gay and Lesbian Alliance or other stu-
dent groups, they are giving money to
one person,” Parks said.

“Everyone knows the Greeks win the
elections, that’s standard knowledge and
giving tuition reimbursement won’t
change that,” he said.

Parks is also quick to note that he is
not faulting Golden’ for his decision to
accept either.

“I think [Golden] has really done a
great job, he’s been really interested in
working with GPSA and he’s been will-
ing to help TA’s out, we just disagree on
this one particular thing,” Parks said.

“I’m not picking on,[Golden]. For the.

graduates, it is a completely inadequate
plan and for undergrads, it is not going
to change the impression that SGB is a
Greek fest. We need people with more
on their agenda in office,” he said.

Marcie Roberts, president of the CGS
student government board, said that the
only reimbursement she is using is the
six credits given by Student Affairs.

“I strongly feel that student activity
money should not be used for tuition.
We put a tremendous amount of time in
serving, and if it attracts more students
to run, in that way, I agree with student

affairs in trying to jump start student
government.

"This council does not feel student
activity money should be used to pay for
other students’ tuition," Roberts said.

Roberts said that this decision will
come up for review with every new
council coming in, and they will be able
to determine whether or not to use the
whole tuition reimbursement.

“If they’re interested in helping student
government, they should know the real
power is in the individual schools on the
graduate level, and to do it right we
would have to fund every president. It’s
absolutely undemocratic,” Parks said.

“If they’re giving $2,000 to CGS, SGB
and GPSA, where are they coming up
with this money?” he asked.

Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs
William Harmon said that reimbursing
the government board presidents, has
been under discussion for a year and a
lot of research has been done.

“We surveyed a number of colleges
and universities about the amount of
financial support they provide for the
SGB presidents and we found that Pitt
was on the lower end of the spectrum,”
Harmon said.

Lewis said he, along with the campus
organizations in his newly—formed
protest group will be holding a press
conference this Thursday at noon in the
sixth floor lounge outside of the SGB
office in the William Pitt Union.

Lewis said he is optimistic that the
plan will be changed.

“I think [the presidents] will be reason-
able people and once they see the stu-
dents are against it, as representatives of
the student body, they will turn it
down,” Lewis said.

Voting for dollars

We are calling for a referendum.

It was recently announced that the presidents of Pitt’s
Student Government Board, CGS Student Government
and Graduate and Professional Student Association will
be reimbursed for 12 credits of undergraduate tuition.
That amounts to roughly $2,000 foreach president.
Half of the money will be coming from Student
Activity fees while the other half will be covered by
the administration. .

The controversy surrounding this decision was met
with immediate reaction. The President of GPSA,
Steven Parks, refused to accept the $2,000 remunera-
tion, while CGS President Marcie Roberts acceptedthat
half of the money which came only from the adminis-
tration. That leaves us with one person who accepted
the reimbursement reward — SGB President Gil
Golden. _ .

But the tuition reimbursement issue aside for one
moment, both the board members and the presidents
of these institutions‘ have a valuable job. The fact that
they represent the various interests of the entire stu-
dent body is more than enough reason to be compen-

‘ sated generously.

Many universities offer full tuition scholarships with
the realization that these student leaders often put in
40-hour work weeks and thus cannot work to support
themselves. At a time when apathy is a major problem
at this uni'versity,.as is evidenced by an unopposed
SGB presidential election last year, perhaps this deci-
sion will act as a catalyst and spur interest in the gen-
eral student population.

But perhaps» one of the reasons we have such an
apathetic student body is because they feel too far
removed, not only from the administrative bureaucra-
cy, but the student bureaucracy as well. It is very simi-
lar to the backlash faced by Congress when it too
decided on a pay raise. Perhaps if the constituents
themselves were asked to make this decision then
Congress would not have looked so fooli-sh. At a time
when the budget is tight, and student tuition fees are
being raised seemingly daily, this decision was made
in an almost tyrannical fashion —— the governmental
elites, voting on an issue without reaching out to their
constituents. _

All we are asking is for proper representation. When
the election for-the new SGB president occurs in
November, the question of tuition reimbursement

0 should appear as a referendum. The issue can then be

decided by those whom it effects the most —— the gen-
eral student population. Besides, what does the presi-
dent have to be afraid of — that maybe, just maybe,

i the constituents will vote no? Well if that’s.the case, so
. be it.

The Value of a Liberal Arts education

Take two people. One has a
university background in histo-
ry and women’s studies, the
other has a degree in market-

ing. The two individuals are

applying for a job with a mar-
keting firm. Who is better qual-
ified? The person with a knowl-
edge of the trends and traits of
the population or the person
who has endeavored to learn
the theories and textbook
examples behind marketing? I
would venture to say that the
applicant schooled in history
and women’s studies would be
better suited.

The marketing major would
be able to elaborate on the
methods of marketing and on

the general ways as to market a

product. At graduation, the
marketing major, having forgot
50 percent or more of the
material memorized for the
multiple choice test, will enter
the job market with none of
the theories, none of the prac-
tice models, knowing nothing
about demographics. The histo-
ry major, just like the marketing
major, will expect to be trained
in the practical day-to—day
duties required of a marketer.
The history major, however,
will bring along with him or
her a knowledge of people.
And what is marketing? It is the
ability to market a product in a
way that coincides with the
general whims of society.
Times have changed, but peo-
ple’s innate behavioral patterns
have remained relatively con-
stant. '
Through the study of history
and women’s studies, this indi-

vidual will approach the job
with a greater (although much
less tangible) ability.

The percentage of college
graduates ending up in a‘ job
within their course of study is

quite low. The last figure I read

stated that 70 percent of gradu-
ates end up in a profession that
differed from their major. 80

where does that leave all of us
CAS students struggling
through the requirements of a
psychology program, a political
science program or a communi-
cations program?

It leaves us free to study, to
explore, to learn as much
about as many different topics
as possible. This is not directed
towards the psychology major
hoping to go into the field of
psychology. It is directed
towards those individuals who
enter college knowing exactly
what where they want to be in
four years. Those students are
the ones who fall into the trap
that says? you must choose a
major and that major must be
practical in its nature.

There is no real basis for that
argument. What is meant by
“practical?” Are we going to
allow our parents and the
media to destroy our one
chance at’ self-determination?
Consumerism does not have to
be the measuring stick of our
success. By no means do we
have to strive to own a fancy

car and fancy shoes. What does
all that mean? What is the
point? By limiting yourself to
choosing a major strictly out of
monetary concern, the original
intent of higher education is
missed.

A college major is not always
the vehicle that will insure suc-
cess. The psychology major has
as good of a chance to succeed
in the business world as the
business major does. What col-
lege can insure, even at a large
university like Pitt, is what it
has always insured. It will
teach. It will “broaden our sym-
pathies.” A classical education
will allow us to see what has
happened, what is happening
and what might happen in the
future.

It allows us to see the status
quo and put it into perspective.
Pittsburgh did not arise on its
own. Pittsburgh has been
shaped and reshaped by indus-
try, by immigrants and by
entrepreneurs. Not until those
factors are understood can
Pittsburgh be understood. And
the argument extends to every
town, every city and every
country in the world. Education
is meant to improve society. T 0
make us aware, more just and
better suited to make personal
choices. It teaches young
women and men to think, to
write, to form opinions, to‘
dream. And that is what it does
best. It is not meant to narrow-
ly train prospective money-
makers.

Election '92

Quayle is really
dove in disguise

Here is the scene: I am in my
fraternity house discussing poli-
tics with some of -my brothers.
It is the same old discussion on
whether or not Republicans

have done a good job manag-.
ing the country for the past 12‘

years. It is shaping up tobe a

who has been beaten down by
the media; andia man who has
been made into a laughing-
stock. In spite of all this he

continues to do hisjob. Despite‘ '
his hard work and ‘dedication,_

he is still questioned. Why? ~
Is it because people do not

Then, out of

smart? If this is
the case ‘then’ I
am left wonder-
ing,‘ since when

the-conservative side of the
political spectrum said some-
thing that I didn’t ‘understand.
He said “... the only thing
George Bush has done wrong
during this last four years is
keeping Dan Quayle as his vice
president.”

Now, this is not the first time
that I have heard- this from a
conservative. And the liberals
— oh those liberals — just love
to bash Dan Quayle.

Why do people think this
way about our vice preside-nt?
What has he done to earn the
disrespect that the media, and
everyone else, shows him?

Dan Quayle is a graduate of
the Indiana University Law
School. He is a former National
Guardsman. He was elected by
the people of Indiana to both
the House of Representatives
and the Senate. He has been a
better vice president than any-
body else in recent memory,
even George Bush.

Are the only strikes against
him the facts that he carelessly
read the wrong spelling of a
wordon a card, and that he
doesn’t like “Murphy Brown?”
This is a man who has devoted
his life to public service; a man

' does a high

IQ become a
requirement of holding public
office? Just because he does not
hold a degree lfrolmhan Ivy
League school, or didn’t study
overseas, doesn’t mean that he
isn’t competent. After all, we
only go to Pitt.

Is it because he grew up
wealthy? You obviously haven’t
seen the checking account of
Al Gore’s father. Gore’s father

was a Senator who had more .

money than God. Al Gore
attended St. Albans School in
Washington D.C.,a school
where the tuition exceeds the
money that most students make
in three years. If people resent
Quayle for growing up

' wealthy, then the same stan-

dard must apply to Gore.
There is no real reason to
dislike Dan Quayle, save his
conservative
Having personally met him at a
function, I can say that he is a
warm, friendly man with a
sharp sense of humor. He is a
devoted family man who has
done a great job balancing his
responsibilities as a father, a

husband and Vice President.

Clinion /9615 an economic vision

The most important issue
in this election year is the
economy. Purchasing power
is decreasing as poverty lev-
els are increasing. And col-
lege students are facing the
worst job market in two
decade_s.,-Sometliing is wrong.

What are the candidates,
President ‘Bush and Gov.
Clinton, proposing to do? The

, contrasts between their plans
1 are radical. One choice is
‘four more years of slow,

steady decline; the other
choice is the beginning of a
real economic revival.

T 0 George Bush, the theo-
ry of supply economics, has
b_ecome gospel truth. Bush
reasons that cutting taxes for
the wealthy will spur them to
invest more in capital assets.
This investment, he argues,
will lead to higher productivi-
ty and higher profit margins.
In turn, workers are sup-
posed to receive higher
wages, thus a higher standard
of living.

While such a theory looks
good on paper, it falls short.
The share of America’s gross
national product saved or
invested has not risen notice-
ably in the past 12 years.
Furthermore, during the
19805, per-person growth in
productivity was the slowest
it has been since World War
II. The revenues freed up by
the Reagan—Bush tax cuts
wound up being used for
speculation and consump-
tion, instead of investment in
our nation’s capital. This
spurred short-term economic
growth, but failed to produce
the growth in wages and pro-
ductivity created by long-

. term investment.

While George Bush pro-
poses more of the same
failed rhetoric, Bill Clinton is
looking to the future. He
understands that the key to

Shawn
McClearn

long-term growth lies not in
faulty assumptions, but in
human. investment. He
knows that even the most
-efficient technology is useless
if it is not manned by a
skilled,‘ well-educated work
force. Many businesses have
already grasped this fact. For
many companies, low wages
and operating costs have
become secondary to the

. skill and adaptability of their
workers.

As Governor of Arkansas,
Clinton has demonstrated a
willingness to invest in the
American people. He has
instituted a series of educa-
tional reforms which have led
to the highest high school
graduation rate in the South.
Furthermore, the state’s col-
lege—going rate of high
school students has increased
from 38.2 percent in 1982 to
51.3 percent in 1991.

On a federal level, he pro-
posed increased federal fund-
ing for child-care and educa-
tional programs such as
Operation Head Start. The
total cost of such reforms
would be around $500 billion
dollars. The funding for these
programs would be raised
through the a combination of
cuts in the military budget
and a modest increase on the

top 2 percent of American
households (i.e. those who
can afford a small tax
increase). While these pro-
posals have lead to accusa-
tions of Clinton being just
another “tax—and-spend” lib-
eral, they indicate that he is a
man with foresight. We look
at other nations, such as our

two biggest economic rivals, '

Japan and Germany, and see
that they understand the
need to invest in their citizen-
1y. 1

Education and infrastru_c-

ture are two of their priori-

ties. Such linvestments mean?
a higher tax burden for the
people of these countries,
but the return on those
investments is growing pro-
ductivity and a higher stan-
dard of living.

When you stop to consider
what the Reagan—Bush sup-
ply-side bunk and wasteful
spending has produced
maybe it’s time for us to start
spending our money in better
ways.

Four more years of George
Bush would mean four more
years of ineffective tax breaks
for the rich and neglect of
our basic citizen needs. Gov.
Clinton, on the other hand,

Re: Last minute advice

, I know how important this election is
to you, but it is also important to me. I
used to be a democrat, but last year I
switched.

I did not switch because we were
winning. I did it because we are right.
However, the country is in jeopardy of
turning back the clock to the horrible
years of the late 1970's.

It wasn't easy, but I did it because I
realized that the liberal ‘ideology that
dominates the party would weaken this
country if permitted. to govern.

I’m writing this to you to underscore
the concern of many Americans about
what will happen to this country if the
Democratic Party gains control of both
the presidency and the Congress.

Let me begin by congratulating you
for getting your re-election campaign on
track. You left your supporters hanging
for months, and now it looks like we
can give people a reason to vote for
you and not against Governor Clinton.

I have some advice for your campaign
as we enter the final months. I can’t
promise victory if you follow my advice,

but it sure beats what our friends in the
“media elite” are telling you.

First, the economy. Let’s face it, we
can’t win on this one, but the more you
neutralize Clinton, the more your other
strengths will shine.

The plan that you announced last

Jake  
Gertsman  

week is good for two reasons. First,
you have finally come out with the
-“vision thing” for the next four years.
The voters can feel confident that you at
least have a plan to make things better
through the next part of the decade.

Second, you have finally come up
with something to ‘counter what Clinton
has been masquerading as an economic
plan.

I’m not going to waste your time’ by
going over all of the economic issues,
but I’ll give you some of the highlights
of the differences between the two

plans that you need to accentuate on_

the campaign trail.

Clinton wants to raise taxes $150 bil-
lion and you want to give everyone a
break. Hisgtax increaseswould be a.bur-

den on small business; your plan would
help them.

4 You have proposed cutting spending
by $132 billion and cutting the inﬂated
budgets of both the White House and
the Congress. He wants $50 billion in
new spending yet asserts that he can
cut the deficit in half. And amazingly he
opposes the very thing that has made
him balance every budget as governor
of Arkansas: a balanced budget ‘amend-
ment. You cannot balance the budget
with increased spending as Clinton pro-
poses. 1

Many will-say that your proposals are
“more of the same.” Your job is to show
everyone that “Clintonomics” are the
failed policies of an administration 12
years ago. And after you bring Clinton
down from his pedestal, you go for the
win.

This election will not be won inside
the beltway or by the editorial board of
The New Yorle Times. It will be decided
in the small towns of the heartland, the
suburbs and by the “Reagan
Democrats.”

The suburban republicans will come
back if you can show them that you are

committed to revitalizing the economy..

The others depend upon how you play

the social issues.
’ These are the people who might be
against an outright ban on abortion but
do not support abortion in the way that
Clinton does. Here, you can show his
“slickness.” He used to be a moderate
on abortion — he even signed a
parental notification bill in Arkansas.

But when the Supreme Court ruled
that Pennsylvania’s restrictions were
constitutional, he ran into the waiting
arms of The National Abortion Rights
Action League and promised to use a
litmus test by appointing justices that
pledge to support Roe v. Wade. Had
you said something like that in regard
to overturning Roe, the media would
have gone berserk.

Finally, remind everyone of your suc-
cesses in the last four years and of
course remind us of the last time a
“moderate”'southern governor was
elected and worked with many of the
same clowns who still control Congress.

The media is correct. This election is
a referendum about you. The ﬁnal out-
come will be determined by how you
portray yourself as a leader for the next
four years and the lack of trust in
Clinton. This is not his election to lose,
it is yours to win.

The Pitt News ~

It could be deemed the lull
between the Eastern storms.
Or the regional David

’_ between the national Goliaths.

Panther head coach Joe
Luxbacher prefers to call it “a
verydifficult game.”

Whatever the analogy, the
Pitt soccer team ‘gets a one-
game respite from conference
play tonight at Pitt Stadium
when_ they host Geneva
College" for a 7:15p.m.
matchup. Following a dream

. weekend that included two Big

East road wins, the matchup
with the Golden Tornadoes
serves as a one-game reprieve
from league play —- with Pitt
facing defending Big East
champ Seton Hall in a first-
place showdown this Saturday.
The prospects of facing as
ominous a foe as the defending
champion Pirates — picked
first in the preseason coaches’
poll — might cause most teams
to look past an opponent like
the Golden Tornadoes. But that
won’t happen to the confer-

ence-leading Panthers, who,-

according to Luxbacher, know
all too_well the disastrous
repercussions for underestimat-
ing a pumped—up non-confer-
ence opponent.

“We’ve already had two
games that we should have
won and didn’t,” Luxbacher
said, alluding to Pitt’s losses to
California [Pa.] State and
Bucknell University. “[Geneva]
is definitely better than Cal
State, who beat us. We’re going
to have to be ready.

“We can’t overlook any-

8 body?

While Luxbacher remains
cautious about the Geneva
.matchup, he is extremely

pleased with the state of his -

team, who collectively
.rebounded from key defensive
breakdowns. of a week ago to
even its record at 2-2.

After being unanimously
picked last in the preseason
Big East coaches’ poll and
opening the season with
winnable losses, Pitt turned the
conference standings upside

_, Two games,.two 1991 playoff teams .

and two victories. Not bad, eh?

The Pittsburgh Steelers were called a
mystery team by some, a cellar dweller .
by others. One sports magazine, which
shall remain nameless, said they would
go 2-14 this year. Okay, it was Atblon 19,

they deserve to be embarrassed
for being that wrong. Hey guys,

win number three should come in the
next two weeks as the Steelers visit two
O-2 teams —- the Chargers and the

Packers.

Predictions of doom continued as the
Steelers were huge underdogs in week
one at Houston. They won 29-24. This
was not a win on emotion or a ﬂuke.
The 27-10 thrashing of the Jets proved . -

down with a 5-1 win over the _

Friars last Friday and 1-0 deci-
sion over BC on Sunday.
Luxbacher calls the back-to-
back victories “the biggest sin-

gle weekend we’ve had” in his

nine years at Pitt.
“To come away with four
points shocked everyone [in

the conferencel,” Luxbacher]

said. “We expected we could

do it because we knew we had.

a pretty good team._

“We just eliminated our mis-

takes.”

While mistakes
demise for the Panthers two
weekends ago, lack of mistakes
spelled" success last weekend.
According to Panther forward
Scott Alexander, the key to the
weekend of wealth involved
two simple factors: following
wel1—scripted game plans and
playing disciplined defensive
soccer.

“We followed the game plan
[all weekend],” Alexander said.
“[Against BC] we just played a
defensive-minded game and
everybody was in deep — total
counterattack  off of their
defense.

,“Our defense is the key to
our game. If our defense is on,
then our offense is automatical-
ly on.”

Someone who was definitely
“on” in Pitt’s two victories was
first-year goalie Adam Spitzer.
The Morganville, NJ native
made 10 saves in his first two
collegiate starts against
Providence and BC, earning
Big East Defensive Player of
the Week honors. The veteran
effort by the rookie netminder
wasnot lost in the excitement
over Pitt’s first league win in
two _years. _

“He [Spitzer] played two
great games,” senior forward
Scott Alexander said. “He came
up big when he had to.”

If Spitzer continues to
sparkle tonight against Geneva,
the Golden'Tornadoes’ early-
season offensive drought is all
but certain to continue. Geneva

_is 1-2 overall — beating

Slippery Rock, 4-1; falling to
West Virginia Wesleyan, 6-0
and the University of the

offensive woes were com-
pounded byvthe loss of mid-
fielder Ralph‘Wiancko, a top
first-year player who went

down with a pulled thigh mus- /

cle. Geneva’s defense was also
dealt a blow — two blows
actually —- when senior sweep-
er Pat Fend (broken ankle) and
Geneva’s starting keeper (13
stitches to the head) were
injured. None of those three
will play against Pitt.

” While Murray acknowledges
Pitt’s penchant for “defense
first,” as well as the strong net-
minding turned in by Spitzer in
the Panthers’ pair of victories,
he still considers Pitt’s best
offensive threat as his team’s
biggest roadblock to victory.

“Clearly, We’re going to need
to watch [Pitt forward] Eric
Prex very closely,” Murray said.
“In our opinion, he is tactically
their most proficient player.

“We’re going to have to
match him up with one of our
stronger players.”

Detroit,
Chicago,
to battle
for NFC

Central

By Jim Lakely

Sports Editor g

There has been a con-
stant in the National
Football Conference
Central in the past few
years: The Chicago
Bears’ stranglehold on
the title.

Every year from wire
to. wire, “Da Bears” have
been able to thwart any
serious challenges 
until last year. Unless the
“Monsters of the
Midway” can make the
transition to younger
players smooth and easy,
the title may be up for

grabs for a few years to '

come.

The Detroit Lions are
an inspired team that
now knows it can win.
Dedicating last season to
their fallen hero, para-
lyzed offensive lineman
Mike Utley, only the
mighty Redskins stood
between the Lions and a
‘Super Bowl victory. Yes,
I said victory. Hell, any
.500 team in the NFC
could have beaten the
Bills.

Tragically, this team
has even more sad inspi-
ration. The deaths of yet
another offensive line-
man, starting left guard
Eric Andolsek, and assis-
tant coach Lenny Fontes
(head coach Wayne
Fontes’ brother), leaves
this team reeling emo-
tionally.

But the Lions are not
reeling physically. They
have gobs of talent on
offense and just enough

‘ defense to win the black

and blue division. Oh
yeah, they’ also have the
best running back in the
game: Barry Sanders.

Sanders is the MVP of
the conference for one
simple reason. The Lions
would be a second divi-
sion team with out him.
His physical skills are
second to none — truly a
weekly highlight film all
by himself, leading the
NFL with 17 touchdowns,
many of them on spec-
tacular runs.

What makes Sanders a
truly special player is his
unselfishness? Given a
chance to surpass Dallas’
Emmitt Smith for the
rushing title, he passed
up the opportunity
(Detroit’s final game
already in hand), losing
out by only 15 yards.

nm prrr NEWS, Wednesday, September 16, 1992 ,

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staff Writer

The National Football
Conference East is footbal1’s
glamour division. Nowhere is
there more excitement, intensi-
ty or emotion — not to mention
unbelievable talent.

The last two Super Bowl
champions have emerged from
this division and it would be a

shock of gigantic proportion if ,

this year’s champ isn’t another
NFC East power. Three of the
league’s top five clubs reside
here — Washington,
Philadelphia and Dallas - and
they just might be the three
best, bar none.

When these teams get
together you can always
look forward to a lot of hard-
hitting, finger-pointing, trash-
talking and sheer butt-kicking.
Whoever coined the oldphrase
“familiarity breeds contempt”
had these five teams in mind.

Of course, these clubs are so
balancednthat a little bit of luck
goes a long way in determining
this division champion. And
winning the division comes.
with no guarantee that the king
won’t get bumped off on a
blustery Sunday in ]anuary’s
NFC playoffs.

~ . Following their rout of the

Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl
XXVI, the Washington
Redskins endured lengthy
training camp holdouts and
then looked miserable in the

preseason. Compound all that
with their pathetic performance
against Dallas in week one and
the “no repeat” vultures are
lurking everywhere. Defensive
end Charles Mann thinks that
the “Skins desire still burns,”
but admits that something is
still lacking in the chemistry.
Remember, Washington
breezed to a 17-2 season while
going relatively injury free. The
chances of that happening two
years in a row are about as
good as a starting rotation in
baseball going injury free.
Nevertheless, D.C. faithfuls will
have no cause to shed any
tears this season — at least not

_ until the playoffs.

‘Skins defensive coordinator
Richard Petibon’s “Capitol
Defense” is among. the five or

-six stingiest in football. What

they do as well as anyone is
play to their unit’s strengths.
All-Pro corner Darrell Green, at
age 32, is still among the top
three corners in the game.

The ‘Skins’ division hopes
suffered a blow Sunday when
Green broke his forearm, cost-

ing him four to eight weeks. _

However, Petibon is a master,
so don’t expect Martin Mayhew
and A]. Johnson to be hung
out to dry. _ .
Linebacker Wilber Marshall is
a hellacious hitter who has no
weaknesses. Andre Collins is
one of the league’s rising stars
and should join Marshall in the
Pro Bowl someday soon. Mann

personal goals in Sanders’
mind, and it is this unique atti-
tude in a superstar that has
helped bring this team to the
top of the division.

Detroit’s success is largely
dependent on the health and
performance of Sanders, but it
possesses many other offensive
weapons. The run-and—shoot
has been toned down and that
may finally get Sanders over
the 2,000—yard hump.

During his college days at
Southern Cal, quarterback
Rodney Peete played in the
shadow of UCLA’s golden boy,
Troy Aikman. Now he plays in
the shadow of past injuries. If
he can stay healthy enough to
scamper around and deliver the

title. With three All-Pros con-
sisting of linebacker Chris
Spielman, hard-hitting safety
Bennie Blades and nose tackle
Jerry Ball, the Lions have
enough muscle to bang with
the big boys. Along with a
healed sack—master, Mike Cofer,
at outside linebacker, they
have enough of a pass rush to
make up for a thin defensive
line.

By the way, Sanders is not
the only big play-maker in
Detroit. Mel Gray, who
became the first player to lead
the league in kic.k—off returns
(25.8) and punt returns (15.4),
is the shining star of the

With the big guns missing in
the backﬁeld, all eyes were on
quarterback Jim Harbaugh, and
he unwaveringly delivered —
not an easy task with head
coach Mike Ditka ready to rip
your head off for every mis-
take. He became the first quar-
terback to start every game for
the Bears since 1981, his excel-
lent scrambling abilities and
leadership qualities have cata-
pulted him to the elite group of
clutch QB’s.

In week one against the
Lions, Harbaugh brought the
Bears the length of the field for
a touchdown pass with only
seven seconds left in the game.
Any quarterback with Ditka’s
blessing Bas to be good.

The receivers are not spectac-
ular, but are solid. Tom Waddle

in two games, many of them
stopping drives by the other
teams. The best example
came in the fourth quarter in
Houston. The Oilers had a
second-and—goa1 at the
Steeler three. A pressured
Moon threw a horrible pass,
and Pittsburgh corner Rod
Woodson was there for the
interception and 57-yard _
return. Five plays later, Neil
O’Donnell threw a nine—yard
scoring pass to Adrian
Cooper for the winning
score.

It is tough to count on
turnovers, but Steeler oppo-
nents mayhave to do just
that. After a decent offensive
day in Houston, the Steelers
pounded a solid Jet defense
for 370 total yards. This is
even more impressive
knowing that the Steeler
offense is battered. They lost
tight ends Eric Green and
Russ Campbell in Houston.
They lost three linemen,
starting tackles john Jackson
and Tunch Ilkin and reserve
Ariel Solomon, during the
Jet game.’

It got so bad that long-
snapper Kendall Gammon
had to step in at tackle for
part of the third quarter.

’ Cowher said the rookie from

Pittsburg State had only
played the position on the

scout team.

Despite the battered front
line, Barry Foster continues
to batter defenses and
silence critics. He had a
strong first game with 107
yards on 26 carries against
the Oilers. Then he explod-
ed last Sunday with 190
yards and two touchdowns
on 33 carries. It was only
one game, but it was a huge
one. For comparisons sake,
Franco Harris never ran for
that much in one game.

Cowher seems ready to
keep leaning on Foster. He
said that he will use him
“until I see his body parts
falling off.”

I understand letting the
hot hand ride, but isn’t that
a bit ridiculous? Do you
remember Merril Hoge? You
know, real nice guy who
went to college in Idaho. He
ran the ball a few times in
the past. And no, he is not
an offensive guard in dis-
guise.

The big problem isthat as
Foster blasts through the
defense, he does it far to
often without the ball. He
lost three fumbles against
New York. That has been
the worst part of the
Steelers’ offense — turning
the ball over seven times in
two games. Cowher said the

Continued from page 12
These awards are not

being thrown at him for noth-
ing.

In the 1991 season, Williams
started every game and ﬁnished

the season with 79 tackles,
which was second on the
Rutgers team.

The man ahead of him was
Elnardo Webster, who now
plays for the Pittsburgh

Steelers.

This year, Shawn seems to be
picking up right where he left
off. .

He has already recorded
seven tackles, four assists and

three iquarterback sacks in
Rutgers’ first two games, which
were against Big East rival
Boston College and Division I-
AA Colgate.

Those three sacks recorded
by Williams this year placed
him fourth among Rutgers’ all
time career sack leaders with a
total of 18.

Williams was recruited by vir-
tually every Big East school as
well as a few Big Ten and a
few ACC schools.

But he had little trouble in
making ‘his decision to attend
Rutgers.

“My sister Teri, my sister Kim
and my brother Stan all gradu-
ated from Rutgers,” Williams
said. ’

“I also thought the program
was moving in the right direc-
tion and had a lot of potential.
Plus, I was given the opportu-

nity to play early and be a
major contributor for the
Knights.”

The main reason Shawn has
the potential to be a defensive
force is not only his size, but
his speed, tenacity and football
knowledge all blend together
so well.

“I find myself being at the
right place at the right time a
lot due to a combination of all
my skills, size, balance, coordi-
nation, hard hitting ability, as
well as good football knowl-
edge,” Williams said.

Shawn Williams has a very
good chance to play in the
NFL next year.

He might even get to stay
in New Jersey as heir apparent
to another pretty good out-
side linebacker. Now if he
could just change his number
to 56...

team has been dodging bullets
and will not be able to do it
forever.

What they can do is move
the ball. Neil O’Donnell has
not been spectacular, but he
does not have to be. Ron
Erhardt’s offense features the
run, with some passing.
O’Donnell has given the team
just what it needed.

Except for a horrible pass,
which was intercepted early in
the Jet game, he has kept the
mistakes to a minimum.

The guy making much of
O’Donnell’s success possible is
second—year wide receiver Jeff
Graham.

With Louis Lipps holding out
and Eric Green hurt somebody
had to step up, and Graham
has come through. He has
caught 13 of the 25 passes
completed by O’Donnell so far
for 228 yards.

- What they need is another
weapon. Adrian Cooper is a
solid tight end, but he cannot
do what Greendoes.

For the offense to keep on
rolling, Green must get.
healthy. He has had enough
physical problems that one has
to wonder if he is injury prone.

With or without him,
the Steelers are not a great
team. They are a very good
one. Cowher and his staff have
put things together.

Their players are playing at
optimum level. Woodson is
looking like the best in the
game again. Foster and
Graham are looking like out-
standing players fo the first
time.

Players like defensive end
Donald Evans and defensive
back Darren Perry are playing '
over their heads.

The Steelers are still a bit
of a mystery. In 1989 they
lost their first two games by
a combined score of 92-10.
They came back to make
the playoffs. Maybe this year
will be ‘89 in reverse. Do not
bet on it. Unless it does
happen, so—cal1ed experts
like those at At/9/0n’s will look
very bad, eh? Hell, they
deserve it.

year, and although not a true
burner, can get open against
man coverage. _

Although not the juggernaut
of a few years back, Chicago is
still a solid defensive force but
aging and fattening quickly.

The Fridge, 30 years old, has
made headlines with his weight
(ballooning to nearly 400
pounds. at season’s end), but
can make headaches for run-
ning backs with his awesome
run defense. It is not easy for a
player to move a 400 pound
man out of his way, especially
one that is three feet wide.

Richard Dent, 32, and Steve
McMichael, 35, round out the
All—Socia1 Security defensive
line. ‘Dent canstill be a force to
reckon with but only when he
can catch his breath.
McMichael, despite his age, can
still rush the passer effectively
— sharing the lead in sacks for
tackles with nine.

Take a one long, last look.
This will likely be the last
season for Hall-of-Famer-to—be
inside linebacker Mike
Singletary. Those shark—like
eyes that widen at the snap
of the ball have frightened
many a running back. The line-
backers are in transition with
solid, but not spectacular, ath-
letes ready to fill in the mid-
way.

Pro Bowl safeties Mark
Carrier an_d_.Shaun Gayle are
arguably the best pair in the
game. They can help neutralize

the NFC’s big-play receivers in
the zone, but where the Bears
are weak is in man coverage.

Chicago and Detroit will
duke it out and the best all-
around offensive attack (or if
the Bears can stop Sanders)
will win.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers
are going to be the Detroit
Lions of 1992. With the most
innovative coach in the league,
quarterback guru Sam Wyche,
now at the controls, the much
maligned Vinnie Testaverde
and the Bucs will shock the
grind—it-out NFC Central.

Wyche used smoke and mir-
rors, along with talented play-
ers, to take a poor defensive
club like Cincinnati to the
Super Bowl. If he can do that,
he can finish third here.

Wyche’s personality will also
be a breath of fresh air to a
team that has mastered the art
of stinking up the joint. He is a
master motivator and a player’s
coach. Two traits that have
been lacking in head coach
since the departure of the
charismatic John McKay.

The receivers position is not
deep_, but have experienced
and proven performers in (the
other) Mark Carrier and former
Bronco Ricky Nattiel.

If Testaverde begins to
waver, this team has~more than
enough talent to run the ball
effectively. Reggie Cobb rushed
for 752 yards last year, most of
it coming in the last eight
games. He is a power back

with great moves and speed
who gets with the endurance to
wear down a defense.

Gary Anderson, and Robert
Wilson add depth and provide
a perfect assortment of blockers
and part-time play—makers to
compliment Cobb.

Outside linebacker Broderick
Thomas is a legitimate stud on
defense. He has all the tools to
dominate like (can I say it?)
L.T., and a good season from
the Buccaneers could give him
the exposure needed for a Pro
Bowl appearance.

The Minnesota Vikings
were the best team of the ‘80s
not to win a Super Bowl. Once
loaded in talent, the Vikes are a
team on a sharp decline. New
head coach Dennis Green can
only hope to stop an open
wound that has been bleeding
for years —— yes, since the
Herschel Walker trade.

Terry Allen seems capable of
being the workhorse of Green’s
power running game — a nat-
ural offensive strategy consider-
ing the strength of Minnesota’s
line.

Plan-B acquisition Roger
Craig is no longer the super
star game-breaker he once was
but is still one of the best at
catching the ball out of the
backfield and makes .a nice
compliment to the power back
Allen. ~ .

Speaking of catching the ball,
that is something the Vikings
can do. Cris Carter has replaced
the aging Anthony Carter as the

team’s premier deep threat.
Tight end Steve Jordan has
been to six straight Pro Bowls,
and Hassan Jones has two of
the best hands in football. Too
bad nobody wearing purple
can throw the ball.

Quarterback Rich Gannon is
only 11-12 as a Viking starter
and has hardly shined, but he
is the best they have.

On defense, former Pitt star
Chris Doleman is only a shad-
ow of what he once was.
His league-leading 21 sacks in
1989 have dwindled to seven in
1991 This once-proud defen-
sive unit is now tooold and
too thin to cut it in this tough
division.

The Green Bay Packers
seem to have been re-building
forever. Their 10-6 season in
1989 is looking more and more
like a fluke. Yet another new

coach, former 49er offensive
coordinator Mike Holmgren has
a very difficult job — giving
football’s most loyal fans some-
thing to cheer about.

The “Majik Man”, Don
Majkowski, is the NFL’s equiva-
lent to Sir Mixalot —- an arro-
gant one-hit wonder. His shoul-
der is shot and with it his abili-
ty to throw the ball with any
zip. And that’s the good news.

This team is an absolute
offensive disaster withtheir
only good player, Sterling
Sharpe, wasted with a rubber
armed QB.

Tony “I-think—I—can-beat-
Mike—Tyson” Mandarich has
played the line like he is wear-
ing roller skates, making
Majkowski’s job even tougher.
Safest prediction of the year:
This team of no-names will be
lucky to win four games.

victory. Philly is 41-17 over the
past four seasons but 0-3 in the
playoffs. However, this team is
as focused and determined as
anyone, with the burning eyes
of Reggie White and Gang
Green riveted on that elusive
title. ‘

It all starts with the magical
one. Cunningham is completely
recovered from reconstructive
knee surgery and is poised to
reclaim his status as football’s
most dangerous force. Philly’s

. do-it—all weapon Keith Byars

needs another huge season to
offset the holdout of All-Pro
tight end Keith Jackson, who
may sit out the season.

With the speed of Herschel
Walker on board, defenses

' must divert some of their atten-

tion from Cunningham. Blend
in one of the fastest rising
burners in the game, Fred
Barnett and steady Calvin
Williams, and you’ve got one of
the best skilled position lineups
anywhere. The offensive line, a

long-time headache in Philly,

looked decent in the preseason
and strong against New
Orleans and Phoenix. Second-
year tackle Antone Davis is
developing nicely.

There isn’t much left to be
said about the Gang Green
defense. They were the first
since 1975 to finish first in all
three defensive categories,
allowing an unbelievably low
222 yards per contest. The trag-
ic death of All-Pro tackle

 

Jason Hillman/ The Pitt New

The Washington Redskins are so talent rich that budding
superstar Ricky Ervins sits the bench.

Jerome Brown leaves a tremen-
dous void but will only serve to
draw this emotional bunch
closer together. Defensive coor-
dinator Bud Carson came on
board last year and transformed
this unit from very good to ‘one
of the best in NFL historyflt all
starts up front.

Leon Seals was acquired from
Buffalo to stuff the run, and
judging by week one’s ham-
mering of New Orleans, the
Birds._of prey will not drop off.

At age 30, _Reggie White’s
speed and power keep him
head and shoulders above any-
one. White and fellow All-Pro
Clyde Simmons form the
league’s most feared tandem,
although they’ll encounter
more double and triple teams
minus Jerome. The intense
ferocity of Seth Joyner could
win him the MVP this season,
as he’s finally getting his just
due as the league’s best all-
around linebacker.

Eric Allen spearheads a nasty
secondary that punishes on
every down with menacing
Wes Hopkins and relentless
Andre Waters at safety.

If this defense duplicates
their ‘91 reign of terror and the
Birds shed that playoff jinx, the
claim can be made that they’re
the best ever. Minus their
leader and beloved compadre,
Brown, the Eagles. will be on a
mission, and that’s a scary
sight.

The Dallas Cowboys’ band-
wagon is already close to
capacity after the Pokes 23-10
win over Washington in week
one. The offense is as explo-
sive as any you’ll see with
dynamite weapons Emmit
Smith and Michael Irvin leading
the way, but Troy. Aikman still
has a lot to prove. His inconsis-
tency and decision—making
leave a lot to be desi_red.‘Alvin
Harper, J.ay Novacek and
Kelvin Martin provide Aikman
with more than enough ammu-
nition to have a tremendous
season. The offensive line is
average, at best, although Smith
makes any line look better.

The defense looked tremen-
dous in thrashing Washington,
but much of that can be attrib-
uted to the el_ectrically charged
atmosphere of Texas Stadium.
Dallas played as if it was its
biggest game of the year (over
their heads), while the ‘Skins

Norton Jr. and Russell Maryland
should make the run defense
very solid. However, the sec-
ondary is still packed with
toastmasters, led by Isaac Holt.
Evidence is the second-half
assault Phil Simms and the
Giants put on Sunday, almost
rallying from 34-0.

This team is rising faster than
any other. Dallas should win 10
games and advance to the sec-
ond round of the playoffs. The
offense is cha_mpionship cal-
iber. But with this secondary
and general lack of depth on
defense, those thinking Super
Bowl in Big D are insane.

New York Giants fans
rocked East Rutherford, NJ last
week with chants of “Ray Must
Go,” and with the bullseyes
focused firmly» on the clueless
one, head coach Ray Handley,
the Giants appear ready to drift
away into the lonely world of
the has—beens. Rebuilding
appears to be on the way, with
guys like Maurice Carthon and
Steve DeOssie gone and others
soon to follow.

The running game still looks
effective with Rodney Hampton
ready to bust out behind an
always solid line and monster
fullback Jarrod Bunch

Eric Dorsey and Pepper
Johnson must come up huge,
but honestly, it seems the
Giants are not taking to defen-
sive coordinator Rod Rust’s
new scheme very well.
Lawrence Taylor's tremendous
career is now on the downside
and so is his morale. It might
be overly optimistic to think
Sunday’s second-half near mira-
cle will revive L.T. and the big
blue, but at least they showed
a fire — something they haven’t
done since the early weeks of
last season._With every passing
week, the fans grow more hos-

tile and Handley’s days grow‘.

numbered.

- Cunningham isn’t the only
dangerous field general back.
Tim Rosenbach also returned
last week, although he suffered
a slight concussion against
Tampa Bay and a shoulder
injury against Philadelphia.
With Rosenbach temporarily
down again, the Phoenix
Cardinals are in trouble. They
have annually resided in the
basement, but have regained
some respectability.

Despite some of the most
futile drafting (witness the last
two top picks Eric Swann and
Tony Sacca), the Cards have
assembled some solid talent.
When Rosenbach’s healthy, this
is a dangerous club.

With the likes of Rosenbach,
Johnny Johnson, Ernie Jones
and Randall Hill, the offense is
ready to put up big numbers.
Chris Chandler takes the reigns
at quarterback for now. The
defense boasts big-play line-
backers Ken Harvey, Eric Hill
and Freddie Joe Nunn as well
as bone-crushing safety Tim
McDonald.

The problem lies on the
defensive line where Swann
could be a bust of monumental
proportions. Expect this team
to pull its share of upsets and
get better.
