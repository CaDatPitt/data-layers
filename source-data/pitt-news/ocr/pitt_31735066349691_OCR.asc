BY BILL MOORE

A $70 tuition increase for
undergraduates and a $140 hike for

$150 increase for law students, a
$300 increase for‘ students in the

‘ The $35 per term undergraduate
increase represents a 6% hike,
lifting in-state tuition to $1,210 per
two-term year. 'The-12% graduate
hike will make their tuition $1,280
for Pennsylvania’ residents. _
The increases were part of a
$187.8 million budget package
presented by the Board’s budget
committee chairman, Robert E.
Kirby. “This is an austere budget
necessitated by unavoidable inﬂa-
tionary increases,,’._’ Kirby said in
his budget presentation.

Move Cuts
38 Groups

BY WILLIAM RENKUS

Student Union ofﬁce space will
be reassigned in an effort to match
needs with resources, according to
S.U. Manager Terry Milani.

The plan includes the elimination
of ofﬁce space for 38 organizations,
the establishment of a group ofﬁce

addition of three meeting rooms to
the six presently on the ﬁfth floor of
the Student Union, Milani said.

The total cost of the reorganiza-.
tion should be approximately
$5,000, according to Milani.

A cost of about $3,500 will be
required for painting and moving in
the ofﬁces of Student Affairs and
Veterans’ Affairs, Milani said.

The cost of painting and moving
on the third and fourth ﬂoors will
equal about $1,500.

“We (Ofﬁce of Student Affairs)
conducted an analysis last October
of what the space needs were of the
organizations in. the Student
Union," Milani said.

He discussed the needs of
student groups with leaders of each
recognized organization and deve-

loped a plan requiring wide-spread

reassignments.

The proposed moves will be
completed before fall term and are
being carried out by University
maintenance personnel, Milani
said.

“There will be an inconvenience
for one month but June is a much
better time because there are fewer
activities during the summer.”

Student Government Board
member Chip Hubbard said,
“We're satisﬁed with our alloca-

_,ﬁ‘i'z.V-tion, but I don't personally care for
Vthe idea of stufﬁng seventee

Chancellor Wesley Posvar told
the Trustees he felt the tuition
increase was necessary in light of
“fiscal realities.” He reafﬁrined
his belief in free tuition, but said it
was impossible with the current
level of state funding.

“We weighed the burdens, and
tried to distribute the suffering as
equitably as we could,” Posvar
said.

The budget also included a $4.7 .

million faculty and staff ‘ compensa-
tion increase, and a’ $2.5 million
fringe beneﬁt package hike.

Three Trustees voted in opposi-
tion to the budget, indicating the

increased tuition as the reaso

U.S. Appellate Court Jug
Ruggero J. Aldisert, chairman of
the Trustee's student affairs

committee, offered an explanation
of his negative vote, stating:
“When we became part of the
Commonwealth System of Higher
Education, there was an agree-
ment...that tuition would be
lowered, not increased. . v
“I ‘speak against any tuition
increase as a matter of _principle,”
he said. Aldisert said he believed

' approval of the budget could be an

Bus Only Lane: Pros& Cons

BY DEANNA L. CONGILEO

Extension of the outbound
bus-only lane on Fifth Avenue,
announced by City Planning
Director Robert Paternoster last
week, has produced both opposi-
tion and praise from Oakland

. citizens.

The lane. presently running from
downtown to Craft Avenue, is to be
extended to Belleﬁeld Street, and
eliminates the need for many buses
which stop in Oakland to turn onto
congested Forbes Avenue, Pater-
noster said.

Oakland Chamber of Commerce
member Frank Rubin said, “With
the installation of the bus-only lane
the city is admitting that the
change of Forbes and Fifth to
one-way streets was a mistake."

Rubin charged the city was
establishing the bus lane for the

,same reason the chamber didn’t

want the one-way change.
‘Patients and customers who

.pres_ently can be discharged in

I

front of the medical buildings and
retail stores on the south side of
Fifth will have to be let off in the
middle of the street when the
bus-only lane is installed, Rubin
said. _
“Ambulances will be allowed to
use. the bus lane,” Rubin said,
“but this will only add to“ the
confusion. "The ambulances will
have to cross over three lanes to get
to Monteﬁore and other hospitals
on the north side of Fifth Ave.”
At the chamber meeting Pater-
noster said the bus-only lane would
undergo a trial of 60-90 days.
“The one-way change on Forbes

Ave. and Fifth Ave. was also on a '

trial basis,” Rubin said. “They're
hypocrites."

Oakland Directors Incorporated
(ODI) President Lois Deveraux said
that in the past the OD]
transportaiton committee has sup-
ported a bus-only lane, but the

group has not recently discussed

the subject. .

S,/CATHI Stages Picket A

Before Trustees’ Vote

BY CRIS HALL

Twenty sign-toting members of
the Student Coalition Against
Tuition Hikes (SCATH) staged an
orderly but vocal picket prior to
Tuesday’s Board of Trustees
meeting, then sat quietly in the
Stephen Foster Memorial Social
Room and watched the Trustees
increase tuition for the second time
in as many years.

The group formed a circle
outside Stephen Foster at 2:45
p.m., 15 minutes before
meeting was scheduled to begin,
braving windy 45 degree conditions
and chanting, “They say hike, we
say strike_...They say cutback, we

say fight back.”

One SCATH member said the
group would stay outside, but
SCATH spokesperson Irene Kugler
later said they would attend the
meeting.

“Too often students have failed
to-make use of open meetings such

. as this one,” she said. “I don’t

think they (the Trustees) give a
damn whether or not they raise
tuition, but we want to make it
harder for them to do it—make
them do it in front. of us.”

A petition distributed by march-
ers said SCATH had gone through
all “legitimate” channels but was
denied the opportunity to speak at
the Board meeting. _ -

— ‘Those spaces, however, will be

replaced by the construction of a
475-space multipurpose parking
garage at Forbes and Semple at a

‘projected ‘cost of $3.1 million,

Wozniak said.

Advertising for construction bids
will begin this summer, he added.

The garage, which will require
nine to twelve months of construc-
tion, is being ﬁnanced by local
merchant loans, the Parkvale
Savings Association and the
Pittsburgh Parking Authority.

The lowest two levels of the
garage are to be owned by Parkvale
Savings and will probably be
available for use by retail stores
and ofﬁces, Wozniak said.

At the earliest, installation of the
bus-only lane _will begin in 1977,
Paternoster said.

Before the lane can be establish-
ed, the portion o_f Fifth fronting of
Carlow College must be ‘widened
by four feet. Paternoster said in the
past the city has had difficulty
getting bids ‘ for this contract.

“This (the demonstration) is the
way to air the student voice,”
Kugler said. “We want them to
know we don’t like it.”

Carrying signs stating “No
Tuition Hikes” and “Don’t Shut Us
Out Of Pitt,” the SCATH members
silently ﬁled into the Social Room
after the meeting’s opening prayer
and occupied seats hurriedly
provided by a University employe.

They remained quiet throughout
the meeting, though several raised‘

their signs while the tuition?

question was being discussed.
They left after the increase of six
percent was approved.

After the apparentloss, Kugler
said SCATH’s task now is to “do
more research and come up with
more hard-core statistics for future
years.” I

“I thinkwe may have inﬂuenced
them (the Trustees) a littlebit, but
they still got as much as they
thought they needed for what they
thought they needed,” she said.

Trustee Ruggero J. Aldisert
noted SCATH’s presence during
the debate on tuition, but said their
efforts were misdirected.

All buses passing through
Oakland will not necessarily use
the Fifth Avenue bus corridor.

“The Forbes Avenue corridor
may be maintained,” Port Author-
ity Transit (PAT) spokesman
Robert Parker said. Bus schedules
contingent on the installation of the
bus-only have not yet been
developed.

The extension of the bus-only
lane was a response by the city and
PAT to an Environmental Protec-
tion Agency suggestion to reduce
air pollution in the Golden_

Triangle, according to PAT spokes- “.-... ~

man Bill Mattock.

The bus-only’ lane reduces
operating costs through fuel and
maintenance cuts. and. improves
bus service by minimizing passen-
geriinconvenience, Mattock said.

With a shorter passenger ride via
the bus corridor, Mattock said, air
pollution is reduced. \

“Each four-minute delay on a
bus route requires 40 cents in
operating costs,” Mattock said.

 Co-Op Rewards

When the co-op was in the
 A.; ‘planning stages a few months ago,

1 "about thirty letters were sent out to
' colleges and university co-ops
 '7a'round.the country in order to ﬁnd
puthow and how not to set up our»
"‘7ow'n food_-co-operative. Of the three
; responses received, one university
A_told ustheir co-op went bust at the
‘end ‘of last year immediately after
,,_: ntheir chairperson graduated. The
 ,-other two letters came to us by way
'1  of referral; the universities had
" co-ops in their towns but neither
"j were university-related. At their
base the two letters of advice cited
‘hard work and cooperation as the
. main ingredients needed for any
A.-co-op to succeed. -

 

  
   
 

The fact that none of the
A universities queried have their own
 Aco-ops suggests that Pitt’s effort is
:directed toward a unique area. We
A need your help to make ours work
,7'~..f’ where other university co-ops have
failed.

 

 

. During the first week of
' . operation, orders for $137 worth/of
‘ produce were received and ﬁlled by
the co-op’s staff. This week the
 ﬁgure almost doubled, to $250
‘worth of orders, and none of us

A have reason to believe this will be'a
"plateau ﬁgure. By extension, as the
demand for this unique ‘service
grows, our need for an enlarged

A Political Robbery

‘i‘When we became a part of the Commonwealth System of Higher
Education, there was an agreement...that tuition ‘would be lowered,
 not increased. But time and time again, this  has had toincrease
tuition. I speak against tuition as a matter of principle.’
- Board of Trustee member Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert, who was one of
 _;only three Trustees who voted against the tuition increase.

« . ’ Unfortunately, Judge Aldisert is all too correct about the State

legislature’s disregard for its committment to provide low-cost,
high-quality education for Pennsylvania residents.

‘ ' Because the Board of Trustees voted to approve the University
AA budget, and therefore the tuition increase, it would be very easy to put
 the blame on them. We must realize, however, that Pitt is the victim of
' the kind of politics practiced in an election year. Very few politicians
would’vote for increased funding for public education if it meant they

 ,'_th_ey would have had to somehow balance.the budget by cutting $5
-2 ‘million from an already lean proposed budget. In short, the Board had
, lit__tle,alternative but to ‘approve the budget.
- -Although the State legislature is the major villian in this episode of
political robbery, the Board of Trustees can be considered accessories
 to the fact because they did little to stop it. The Board, on..which sits
 executives of some of the most powerful corporations in the world, .
~ ‘could have exerted considerable inﬂuence in Harrisburg if they had
A-wished to do so. Apparently, they not.
A  flhere are some in the state legislature, and on the Board of
Trustees, who believe $70 a year isn’t too much money. Trustee
.__George Barco for one, doesn’t think $70 is too much. It was he who

 co to the Board because Pitt is a state-related school.
behind a state-related school is to provide a low-cost, high-quality
education for state residents. At $1,210 a year, Pitt clearly will not be a
_ place to receive a low-cost education. Perhaps Barco, were he a Pitt
' student, could raise an extra $70 a year, 'but.the point is, he shouldn’t

grow accordingly. “And that .is
where you, the student, come in.

If you can spare an hour of your‘

time each week, we can keep up
with the increase in demand and, in
so doing, continue to provide the
Pitt community with quality pro-
duce at a reasonable cost. The long
range effect of an enlarged, staff
could bring about a ‘decrease in
individual working hours,A i.e.,, a
single hour every other week or
even once a month. This would
leave others free to investigate the

-possibilities of enlarging our

inventory to include dairy products,

Since each of you spends at least
this much time in supermarkets,
walking, waiting in line, and above
all, paying through the nose prices
for your groceries, why not spend
that time helping the Pitt commu-
nity in a self-perpetuating, unique
service in which you will be the
ultimate recipient of the rewards.

The basement of Stephen Foster
Memorial isn’t a dark, murky back
room. And Tuesday, at Pitt’s Board
of Trustees meeting, the proceed-
ings weren't clouded in secrecy.

But somehow, the air wasn’t
quite right.

The Board of Trustees is a very
insulated institution. Its members

-line up around big tables with.

emblazoned blue notebooks to
make decisions couched in bureau-
cratic.-language. The words are not
thrown around lightly, but those
like compensation, student attri-
tion, program cutbacks and auster-
ity budgets lose their human
impact.

It wouldn’t be hard to sit behind

.a long table among distinguished

colleagues and forget that a simple
yes could cause so many Pitt
students so muchutrouble. -

for undergraduates and 12% for
graduate students. Some, includ-

 AirWasn’t ite Right A

Trustees, say the tuition hike is. due
to low state appropriations. '

No matter who is to blame, a
tuition hike will not be easy for
most Pitt students. And that, when
lalﬂdierlil tn the mice of a mandatory
eiiiifti» §S¥‘.’l9§ fee for full-time
students,_ also approved by the
Board of Trustees Tuesday, is
in danger of befuddling the
University's supposed “ ‘mission. ’ ’

One Trustee said, “While I’m
unhappy, if I were a student I’d
ﬁnd another way to pay it.” i

‘ When an obviously misinformed-
statement is made by someone who
virtually controls the lives of the

students who go here, it is time for

the Board of Trustees to realign
their priorities. Very few of them‘
have any real idea of the life
students lead here.

Sure‘’;- they hear second-hand

reports of dismal living’i'conditions- ‘

and overloaded residence halls.
But how manyof them have to deal

day-to-day with‘ the problems of I

on the ﬁring line, but just in case
tragedy strikes, no one will ever

Well, tragedy struck for the

“involved” "people at U.S. Steel in’

the form of justice, and they’re
admitting the shame of guilt leaves

«a lump inthe ol’ blast furnace.

IMPRESSIONS

After strings of pollution ﬁnes,
particularly on U.S. Steel's Clairton
Coke Works, that set the corpora-
tion back hundreds of ‘dollars, it
became embroiled in a dispute over
a pollution crisis last November
that was linked to the deathsof 14
area residents.

“...We also knew we, were
sticking our necks out...,” the U.S.
Steel ad reads.

-hear. about -the critical scarcity of
parking for commuters. But most of
the ‘Trustees rode away from the
meeting Tuesday in sleek, chauf-
fer-driven limousines. No matter

how many reports are given, the -

versions that ﬁlter down‘ to the
Trustees are distilled and lack the

 



urgency for the Trustee that they 

have for the students. '

It is ludicrous to assume students —

. “can ﬁnd another way to pay it,”
without understanding the type of
ﬁght many students wage simply to
stay inA school.

The fact of a tuition hike is moot
now that the Board of Trustees has
voted for the proposed budget. But
the fact Board members do not
have a conception of the people

Then the Group Against Smog

Trustees to step from behind the

ting to pressure from the steel ﬁrm 

during the deadly inversion to ease
coke-burning restrictions despite
the decreasing air quality.

“...All this involvement results
from a series of carefully consider-
ed decisions to spend huge sums of.
money...,” the ad goes on.

And now an investigation ‘is
pending onicharges county ofﬁcials

used erroneous ﬁgures to cover up .

and distort the amount of pollution
billowing fromthe coke works.

“...We mustconsider, Atoo,
whether our neighbors want to help
us continue to be successful...will

tal. climate favor selection of the

innocently and yet so threateningly
wonders.

The trouble for us is, it has for

recent editorial in the Harrisburg

clearly aware of this tactic,

problems and concerns which need
to be resolved but I think it is time
for us (staff and administration) to
take a second look at the Staff
Advisory Board and work a little
more diligently from within and
together rather than at the whims
of an outside group. I would hope
that those who spent so many hours

should not come from an outside

work together with all levels of the
University-—staff and administra-
tion—to resolve the problems
which do exist without charges and
countercharges reeking of union-

margin in the May 12 election has
proven we can and will rise above
such tactics—together for the sake

 History of Film Series

 L: ' ’ Editor

Editor’s note: Jean Maurice

Ly 7 Eugene CIement’Cocteau was an
_ artist of extraordinary talents. His

genius was praised as a poet,
novelist,‘ essayist, dramatist, film
writer and director, painter and as
one of the Diaghilev ballet team,
which also included Picasso and
Stravinsky. He was far quicker than
most of his contemporaries to
appreciate motion pictures as a
new art form and realize ' the

I ‘ possibilities that lie therein.

gl-Ie died in 1963.

 Aunique and personal Cocteau
film, Testament of Orpheus, by the
Film Section will be screened at
the Lecture Hall of Carnegie

. Institute.

BY SAM CHOI

Rarely in the history of cinema
does one ‘ﬁnd an artist’ who can
utilize ﬁlm intensively to state his
‘own life story while afﬁliating it
with classical myth.

« With the Testament of Orpheus
(1959) we see, through immense

‘ ingenuity, a combination of realism

with fantasy, private symbolism
with public myth. liresent with

 if past. Cocteau’s ﬁnal film is a

continuation of concerns he had
previously treated in his earlier
works, Blood of a Poet (1930) and

 ~  Orpheus (1949) —- the place of the’

artist in a cultural tradition.
In the Testament of Orpheus we
‘meet the wandering Cocteau, who
, introduces the ﬁlm by presenting

 “a ‘striptease in which I shall shed

my body to expose my soul.”
Clothed in 18th century garb,
Cocteau follows a scientist through
the various stages of life—from
youth to old age and death. As
Cocteau dies he is brought back
into the 20th century , where he
wanders about encountering gyp-
sies, evil omens and Cegeste, the
dead poet of Orpheus, who offers
him the Flower of Folly, which
Cocteau in turn offers to Minerva,
Goddess of Reason. She slays him
and Cocteau rises to wander again,
only to vanish in the end, convinced
this world is not for him.

Cocteau in his own life, although
a dominant ﬁgure in the French
intellectual scene, was generally
set apart from the surrealistic
movement even though they
shared many of the same concerns.
Born in 1889, Cocteau grew up in
Paris in the pre-cinema generation
before the first World War. He was
in many ways very much a 19th
century romantic in his attitude
toward the artist’s role insociety. It
was in the use of the traditional
framework (classical myths) that
Cocteau found himself unnaccept-
able to "the Surrealists. They
rejected much cultural and material
heritage, believing that it had led
Europe to the costly war.

Cocteau’s ﬁlms draw little from
dreams and symbolism, as did
those of the Surrealists, whose
concerns were derived from
Freud's mining of the subcon-
scious. Rather than having signiﬁ-
cance in themselves, dreams were
used by Cocteau to initiate the

mechanism bv letting the mind.

to experience. He rejects symbols
and substitutes acts, encounters
and allegories of these acts the
spectator can make symbols of if he
wishes/. Often these encounters end
with a sense of exclusion.

Seeing himself as 'a poet and
using all the arts as his medium of
expression, ‘Cocteau once said

many of his works could “only exist -

on the screen.” ‘‘I tried to use the
camera not like a pen but like ink. I
interwove many myths. It is a
drama of the visible and the

invisible . ’ '

“great desire to live a reality which
IS truly mine and which is beyond

,Very rarely does a recording
emerge that possesses as much
magical quality as does David
Sancious and Tone’s new release,
Transformation [The Speed of

Sancious was once the keyboard
player for Bruce Springsteen, but

 

he decided to quit wasting, his
talent and strike out on his own.
Transformation is intense jazz-rock
that clearly exhibits the multi-
talented Sancious, who plays every
instrument on the album except
bass and drums. His band, Tone,
consists of‘ Gerald Carboy on bass
and Ernest ‘Carter on drums.

Heinz Hall and the Pittsburgh

this season, bringing ﬁrst-rate

Jose Feliciano held out the

prospect of closing this season with ~

Monday evening would probably
agree he was disappointing at best.

As a matter of fact, the classical .

thrilling than the selections by the '

Conductor Donald Johanos stole
the show, as he usuallydoes, with

‘.. .

The title track, “Transformation
(The Speed of Love)”, is an
eighteen-minute journey into San-
cious soul. It begins very
rhythmically and is drenched with
spacey keyboards. Carboy’s bass
lines are brilliant and hold the
piece togther while Sancious
improvises. A touch of surrealism
is provided by Gayle Moran’s
haunting vocals. Sancious deﬁnes
this piece as: “a humble prayer of

vibration, to express a deep love  -.-

the source of creation.”

Transformation is an extremely
original recording and is quite an
accomplishment for the 22-year-old
Sancious. It has its faults, such as
drawn-out improvisations and oc-
casional repetitiveness, but one can
only assume Sancious’s best years
are ahead of him.

Transformation contains a vari-
ety of different musical formulas
and this is what makes it so
interesting. Sancious combines the

Feliciano

Gershwin-Bennett’s “Porgy and
Bess”:lacked the black, southern
ﬂavor ‘so ‘inherent to the original
score. It began too slowly and had
the obvious priority of including as
much of the orchestra as possible,

as it was meant to be portrayed.

Feliciano came on in la sky-blue
outﬁt with open white collar and
sequins about the shoulders,
opening with the Bill Withers hit,
"Use Me.” Throughout the soulful

\I"'

V as opposed to presenting the drama

tune Feliciano was funky While thtig-5;‘ ‘r

brass section‘ in the orchestra‘
dragged. Not that it was the brass’
fault, though, since their timing
seemed right on the button;“but
Feliciano, as is his style, was rather

off the cuff, open to slowing down-
and speeding up at whim. Another
factor must have been Feliciano’s
conductor, Barry Fasman, who had
taken charge of the symphony for

the “pop” half of the program.

The evening's high points were
Feliciano’s own “Listen to the
Falling Rain,” one of the most
underrated love songs in recent

‘years, and the ‘Mamas and Papa’s
’ ” On the

what "his ﬁngers could do up
against an effective arrangement of

strings, percussion and synthesi-
zer. On the latter, egged on by
eager opening applause, he turned
in a ﬁne vocal backed by some
especially hard drumming by his
own man, Paulinho Magalnaes. ,

The song that most Feliciano
fans had probably hoped to hear
was merely thrown in at the
end—“Light My‘Fire,” the hot

. ballad that skyrocketed the small
Spanish-Harlem teenager to fame, 'l_ _.
consisted of a verse and a singlealgt.

Turns?

      

BY STEVE SYBERT
Associate Sports Editor

If someone told me he enjoyed watching 33 men in souped up cars
turning left all day, I'd say he was nuts. .

If someone told me he liked the racing part of auto racing more than
witnessing a terriﬁc fatal crack-up, I’d again say he was nuts.

And if someone told me he’d rather stay at home and watch the Indy
500 on Memorial Day than be drinking beer somewhere, I’d still say he
was nuts.

Maybe I’m nuts. I don’t admit to giving up beer for the Indy 500, nor

/ 4' do I admit enjoying a 200-mile per hour merry-go-round. But I do

ff‘...

r

'..r

/ A.

I confess to one thing: watching the race just to say I saw it happen—a
fatality, a spectacular ﬁrey crash, a man struggling to escape the
clutches of his ﬂaming race car. ' ,

Many people won’t admit it, but I will. It was the same when the
maskless Andy Brown played goalie for the Penguins. I didn't wish it
on him, but I wanted to be there the night he took a slapshot in the face
and learned his lesson.

I never cared for auto racing. How can you enjoy a sport where 23
percentxof all the men who drove in the Indy 500, the biggest race of
them all, were killed in racing? Yes, 'of the 503 men who have driven in
the 59. Indy 500$, 35 were killed in that race and another 79 died in
other races on other tracks. ‘ - .

Longtime racing writer Bill Verigan said in Sports Illustrated, “I
have seen too much dying in auto racing. I cover it now like a war

correspondent in a battle zone, hating myself for the selﬁsh satisfaction -

I receive from writing another big story about killing. And nowhere
does that feeling haunt me like Indianapolis.” ‘

Verigan went on to describe his feelings when .Salt Walther’s car
exploded and when Swede Savage, gray from the fire extinguishers,
was placed in the ambulance following spectacular stnashups of races
several years ago. I saw those events too, and I felt the same
way—sick. —»

- Including drivers, mechanics, members from the pit crew and
spectators, 53 people have been killed at the Indy 500 and that’s
approximately one person per race.

According_.to Verigan, it is the best drivers who die, for they are the
ones who have to go faster, then faster and‘ consequently ‘take more
risks in trying toreach the top of their profession. But many men are
killed while trying. _

“An entire ﬁeld is emotionally out of control,” Verigansaid of the
Indy 500 and the drivers who will do anything to win. But for 114 men

-who raced there and risked their lives for the checkered ﬂag and lost,
nothing remains for his survivors but questions and ifs.

“There’s no glory then,” Verigan said. “He might.,get'a paragraph
in the newspapers. He might get a race named in his memory. A fund
might be established ;for the family that sacriﬁced to let him race.

Like a lot of people, I‘ wonder why men do it. Aside from the
almighty dollar, what makes a man want to risk his life every time he

performs? I guess everyone has to be an Evel Knievel, who has been .

quite lucky so far compared tohis race car driving counterparts.
As for watching this year’s Indy 500, I think I’d rather be drinking
beer somewhere. ‘ '

BY TOM HALL

Sports Editor
When Dave Parker returns to the

starting lineup after recovering
from nagging ailments, the Pirates
may be faced with a bit of a
problem.

But at thisstage of the season,
with the Bucs two games behind
the division-leading Phillies, it’s
the kind of problem the Pirates
could use more of. The coming
dilemma: _
veteran slugger Bill Robinson?

Robinson hit his second game-
winning homer in as many days
against? the St. Louis Cardinals

,Tuesday "as the Bucs made it

two-for-two in their series with the

Cards.
It was a tough battle from a

pitcher’s standpoint, as Jim Rooker
and Cardinals Bob Forsch, Harry
Rasmussen and Al Hrabosky ﬁred
some ‘excellent baseball and the
two teams entered the ninth inning
tied one all. Forsch was forced to
leave the game_ in the seventh after
pulling a shoulder muscle.
Hrabosky, known as “the mad

,Hungarian,” came on to pitch the

ninth facing the top of the Pirate
order. He immediately got himself
in trouble, giving up a lead-off walk
to Richie Hebner and a single to Al
Oliver.

He settled down enough to fan
Willie Stargell and Richie Zisk on

-fastballs and grab a quick

two-strike count on Robinson.

. Then he delivered the fateful pitch

Robinson stroked into almost the
exact place he had put the ball the
night before when the Bucs
squeeked out a 2-1 win.

What will become of 4.

    

Robinson’s blast gave Rooker a
comfortable three-run lead, and
that was all the man who is rapidly
becoming the Pirate ace needed to
finish the Cards. Rooker gave up
only six hits and a single run in
raising his won-lost mark to 5-1.

Both Robinson’s and Rooker’s
performances slightly overshadow-
ed some great ﬁelding plays turned
in by the V Pirates, that, ' if
they had not been made, might
well have changed the entire
complexion of the game.

In the ﬁrst inning, Reggie Smith
hit a towering shot over the wall in
left-center ﬁeld; Oliver raced over
from his center ﬁeld position and,
relying on the jumping ability that
made him an outstanding basket-
ball player in his high school days,
timed his leap perfectly and caught

. FY '. “ 

 

the ball on the other side; of the

fence. ~ . A ’

Hebner, who is not touted for his
defensive skills,

wicked smash off the bat of Lou,

Brock in the eighth. After Ted

Simmons singled with one out,“

Brock hit his drive up the third base
line. Hebner stabbed the ball ‘and’
made the relay to second for the
force on Simmons, ending? the
threat.

But the man of the evening had
to be Robinson, whose hitting
streak has kept the Pirates winning

in the absence of the power-hitting".._:_. A

Parker. Since taking over for
Parker six games ago, Robinson

has upped his average to .396, and '

has collected eight hits, including ’ "

‘three homers, and has knocked in I

~ ‘six runs.
