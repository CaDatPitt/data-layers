 Before Druids can start on its road back, the

Jtween the -non-fraternity and fraternity members
“of the group will have to be removed. Druids who
are afﬁliated with social fraternities have too

long. looked upon non-fratei"n1t‘y members with
undue suspicion and distrust. Non—fraternity mem-
bers, on the other hand, have been obsessed by

C?-persecution complexes and have intensiﬁed a riv-

OLLEGEV STUDENTS of some intellectual curiosity
., and somewhat less learning. are obsessed frequent-
ly with the belief thatrthey have“ something to tell the
world which-. the world would appreciate hearing. Erro-
neous as this notion undoubtedly is», it nevertheless gives
the young columnist, new to his trade and unsure of his
tools, most of the courage, needed to pass‘ reﬁections
upon moving political events. This belief that what I
:may write is important, isinot deep-rooted within me. I
am thoroughly conscious of -the fact that other people's
opinions may be at least as valuable as mine. Never-
the less, that.belief constitutes my only defense for ﬁll-
ing’ this space each issue.
editor is willing to print. what I have to say.

WHAT I WRITE I. hope will interest. people. ‘I only
hope. Two or three years"-ago, if I had been columnist,
I would have expected a little ‘buzz of comment after
the appearance-of each article. I was quite sure, then,...
"that my ideas and opinions were of -interest to others.
I remember that, when I waslnjconversation ‘with other
‘people, I used to pour. out glorious dissertations on po-
litical and sociological questions. And _-I shudder to
think how I must have bored my -.listeners.. I know bet-.
ter, now. I dissertate only-9 occasionally, and I must
be provoked. into it., And .it’s really only-the‘ vestiges
of an old habit, anyway. 3 ’ i I _, ‘

BUT, IF 1- SHALL be thankful now that a bare major-
ity of readers of the NEWS‘ knows, after a month's time,
that there is a political column in this newspaper, I
shall expect them to know its name. I, shall expect that
because of ,the intriguing little word “eﬁluvia." Efflu-
via. means (this is to save you the task of looking the
word up in the dictionary, which you probably wouldn't

‘ ‘do, anyway), “a subtle emsanatlon, usually noxious.”

THE TITLE IS__ NOT a particularly appropriate one.
It was not selected for its appropriateness. Instead, If
I may speak frankly (I see no reason’ why I should not,
since I have_ no tears of‘ censors as’yet), EFFLUVIA,
as the title,.is merely a device to catch attention’ and
to arouse curiosity. To me, eﬂ‘luvia—the. word, «itself,
I mean, not the emanation (some joke, eh,~boss?),—"-to
me, eﬂluvia has a certain romantic appeal, an arresting
force; and I thought that perhaps other persons would
notice these‘ things, too. If they.did, I felt sure jtiptf
they would read the first two paragraphs, not just‘ the
first two lines,‘ before they gave, up. Furthermore, I
thought that, puzzled as they would surely be by this
word to be found only indlctlonaries, theyiwould look
over the first two paragraphs ‘of thesecond and third
and maybe even later articles before they’ threw in the
sponge, realizing'that,.l'.here was nothing in the column
fomthem. I thought, also, that of the people who looked
at; y column because of ltsname, a few would remain
togread and even to appreciate. This is ‘almost certain‘-
lye. forlorn hope, butit is backed by such 9. hopegthat
_I amwriting. gr I I ‘ ‘-

” - THE ABOVE REMARKS are not meant as cynical ‘ob-
servations upon the students at Pitt. "Rather, they con-
stitute a confession of. modesty, I know veryJwell that
a great many of ,my.articles are going to appear low-
grade when compared with the best of ~ the recognized
columnists of metropolitan» newspapers or magazines.
And almost surely,‘my’nrost loved-_outpou'rlngs will -not
cause huzzas to split the welkln (or can "only. sports
writers use that?, Hah, one feud alreadyl). _ Yet, Igam
fully convinced thata political ‘column ha_,s_1ts’ place in
the newspaper at Pitt, or.ln‘athe newspaper at  other‘

1 university. -

. . ij -
FOR THEPOLITICAL column does bring before the
student the opinions on controversial issues of one stu-

dent who may be taken as representing at least a sec-‘
tion of student opinion as a whole. .And it may act as - .

a "focus for studentsof ideas’ and thoughts. so Surely,
there are sorineiistuedelnts ‘who are interested in what an-
other student thlnks.. If there are, it is to those stu-
dents espe.cla.ll_y that I write. For I might as well state
now that I expect ‘to take "my column seriously. I ‘ex-

pect to discuss political affairs to the best of my ability_

and within only Elie limits of ‘my knowledge. And I ex-
pect to take honest stands on issues andsto pursue 3.

~ policy of intellectual stralghtforwardness.

MY MOOD IS NOT ONE, particularly, or idealism. I

simply feel that there are many ‘grave questions which ~

students should discuss and manygrave affairs in which
students should, take part. And my chief purpose shall
be to present information, to derive conclusions from
that- information, and to attempt to make students take

‘an’ interest in political affairs. ~ A

- By persistent effort, Dr. Stephen L.
Goodale, head of the metallurgy de-
partment, was able, to procure the-
fllm, “Lead Smelting," that was shown
to the department seminar on Thurs-
day durlng the fourth hour. The
ﬁlm was borrowed to the department
through the courtesy of the United
States Bureau of Mines.

Because of the unusual opportunity
afforded_ the students’ by seeing the
ﬁlm, and _due to the -fact that it con-

the metallurgy department officers
which was regularly scheduled to
take place this period, was postponed
until .the next meeting of the group.

- Custotlnso Exams

 

To Substitute Blue and Gold

Arm Bands for“ Green

 

This is the last week for thegreen
arm band at Pitt. According to the
“Vade Mecum,”\ freshman women's

handbook, the first of all ‘customs reg-
ulations is “All freshman women shall

wear: the green arm band until they»

have passed an examination on the
history and customs of Pitt, after
which they shall receive the official
blue" and gold band."

Every day this week, from 8:30 to
3:30, the customs committee of WSGA
will -conduct exams at the customs
House. The test
questions ‘will deal with the history
of the University, Pitt songs, chants,
and cheers, knowledge of the names
of University officials and campus
leaders, and knowledge of the func-
tions and leaders of the more import-
ant women's organizations. Each
freshman woman passing the examin-

ation will substitute her green arm

band for one of blue and gold.
