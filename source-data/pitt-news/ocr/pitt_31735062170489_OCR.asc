McGOVERN: “Restoration of peace ‘should be the number one ob-,

jective of this country."

,5. Dem. Trio Blasts Nixon

on  Wor, Economy

by KARI BALDYS

Saturday night- at the Allegh-
eny County Municipal Airport,
an estimated 2,000‘ people turn-
“ed out to hear George McGov-
ern,.Edmund Muskie, and Milton
Shapp attack the Nixon adminis-

tration while calling for com--

plete support of the entire Demo-
cratic ticket. The airport rally
completed a five-stop, all day
. tour of Pennsylvania by the trio
to muster support for McGovern.

The thrust of McGoVern’s
speech was the war and the eco-
nomy. “The restoration of peace
should be the number one objec-
tive of. this country,” he said.

Crime Incidents otPitt  
Spark Student Protest 

by MIKE MILLER

Members of the Legal Awareness Committee are
agitating for more police on campus. An alleg-
ed increase in the rate of violent crimes on camp-
us has precipitated the committee’s concern.

According to statistics compiled by the LAC
from campus police reports, there were 17 larcenies,
17 burglaries, 3 strong arms. 1 rape, 2 attempted
rapes. 4 purse snatchings and 2 armed robberies
during the period Sept. 28 to Oct. 18.

The committee had planned demonstrations and
leafletting for the Parent's Weekend activities last
Saturday, but called off the demonstrations after
several meetings with administrators concerning the

problem.

Committee members were passing out litera-
ture and soliciting signatures on petitions during

the weekend, however. ,

Several campus’ patrolmen supported the pro-
test, feeling that Campus Police Superintendent
Joseph Gil is placing emphasis on protecting
University buildings rather than people by deploy-
ing electronic security equipment instead of more

officers.

Dr. Jerome B. Schneewind,
dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) at the University
since April 18, 1969, will resign
that post to resume teaching and

Dr. Bhoten A. Smith. Provost,
announced Deana Schneewind‘s

mittee will be appointed as soon
as possible to look for a replace-
ment. ‘

Dean Schneewind will contin-
ue to hold his faculty position as

professor of "philosophy. He will‘

take a year’s sabbatical from
August 31, 1972, to Sept. 1, 1974.

the, time he accepted the post. it
was agreed by the Provost that he
could return to the faculty after
about four years."

A long list of changes and inno-
vations have taken place in the
College during Dean Schneewind's
administration, including:

—'A Freshman Studies option with special
small seminars and team-taught courses.

—A liberal Studies major.

——A dqerred matriculation‘ policy which al-
lows the student, once admitted, to defer
his or her starting date for up to two years.

—The opportunity to teach courses as an un-
dergraduate and, via the Chancellor’: Un-
dergraduate Teaching Fellowship, to be
paid for that teaching.

—A credit-no entry grading system.

—Post-baccalaureate combination degrees
which allow the student to enter graduate
or professional schools at Pitt after com-
pleting three years of undergraduate work

and to receive a bachelor's degree after
completing the first year of graduate or
professional study.

—-A new Center for the Improvement of
Teaching. ’

Gil, however, has been attempting to move offi
cer.- out of buildings to patrol the streets aroun ,,
_ the campus. The LAC feels that he is taking offi
cers out of areas that.-would become high crim‘
areas in the officers’ absence. "‘ 

The committee objected .to plans for rernov

rary, Schenley Quadrangle, Benedum Hall and.

Joseph Dutton; vice chancellor for operations
said that Gil is shifting men to insure better secur ,
ity coverage and that the men are protestinggbe "

members have expressed the feeling that the police
men are attempting to arouse student sentimen .‘
against Gil in order to carry on their running feu

In an interview in the Universi-
ty Times on May 28, 1969, shortly
after assuming the deanship,
Dean Schneewind said he consi-
dered academic reform his first
priority. “We must recognize that
the university is somehow differ-
ent today,” he said. “More kinds
of people are going to college.
Many of these students have no in-
terest in graduate school or pro-
fessional academics. Education
here must.be geared in part of
their‘ needs. The University real-
istically can have an exciting pro-
gram} it will probably be inappli-
cable for other universitites.”

Dean Schneewind came to Pitt
in 1964 from Yale University,
where he was assistant profes-
sor. He also taught at Princeton
University and the Unive_rsity of
Chicago and, as a visiting profes-

sor, at Stanford University and '
the University of Leicester in Eng-.

land. He holds a BA‘. from Cor-
nell and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from Princeton University.

Governor Shapp turned the
attacks on Nixon’s economic poli-
cies into an attack on the Repub-
lican party. recounting a history-
of Republican economic atroci-
ties from the time of Herbert
Hoover to the present. He said,
"The Republican party is notor-
ious for getting this country’s
economy into hot water. “

Application requires that a
non-profit organization have a
sponsor,” says Swazuk. “But we
are trying to form our organiza-
tion along. our own lines, and
our goals may not be in line
with someone elses.”

The goals of which the direc-
tors speak include both providing
cheap local entertainment, op-
portunities for exposure for local
artists and the encouraging of
careers in mass media among
high school students.

This last objective is an out-
growth of the observation that
high school students are largely
ignorant of the opportunities
mass media offers.

Hall explained the workshops
as ones which would expose stu-
dents to the vastness of media.
“After a workshop session at a
high school, we would follow-up

by providing equipment with _.

which they could experiment.
About two weeks later, we would
return.” The product-—the stud-
ents’ own media creation—would
be put together with the help
of the group.

Another important aspect of the
Pittsburgh Free Media is the dis-
covery of local talent. Citing the
local creators of “Godspell" as
an example of hidden talent,
Hall and Swazuk claim that local
musicians and playwrights are
plentiful, but go sponsorless due
to economics. '

The membership plan for Pitts-
burgh Free Media, they say,
would insure audiences for these
artists while eliminating the

need for constantcatering to in-
dividual tastes in order to make
a profit.

In addition to high school
workshop plans, the organization
would attempt to fund or sponsor
such local talent.

Membership fees would cover
at least one major event each
month with scattered offerings
of lesser magnitude.

To reach their goal of “media
cultural awareness,” cultivation
of local artistry, and reasonably
priced entertainment, the. co-

directors feel they must increase ‘

membership and obtain indoor
space for their programming.

Anyone interested in this pro-
ject is urged to contact either
Hall or Swazuk at: Pittsburgh

To Have Public Forum

by JOHN CAPITMAN

At it’s fourth meeting the CAS
Cabinet discussed the depart-
mental status and credit eligibil-
ity of the ROTC program at Pitt.

“The point is to establish whe-
ther or not ROTC is an outside
institution that is fn this campus
only through Uni ersity sanction,
and whether or" not as such it

should be given credit," said Jim.

Monahan, a junior, Psychology
major and member of the~CAS
Cabinet. «

"ROTC does not teach, the same
kind of use of one‘s intelligence.”
said professor White of the His-
tory department," as do the other

departments of the College, and
should not be given credit."

This charge was countered by
Colonel ‘Mishtowt, who runs the
Army ROTC program at Pitt and
has attended other meetings about

the credit request, who explained,‘
“I personally sit in on many of‘

our classes, in order to make sure
that both faculty and student re-
tain their Academic freedom.”

The meeting, continued with
several arguments, for and against
the granting of credit to ROTC
courses and the consideration as
to whether or not the ROTC de-

partment is on a par with other

departments.

Students Intern In Consumer

(Continued Tram Page T)
Rex Smith, who is the bureau's

veteranintern.said he does "just '

about everything" at the bureau
to earn his six credits. Rex. a
stereo buff, soon found himself
handleing complaints about ster-
eo’s, TV’s and even telephones.

In between answering phones"
and going on the coffee run, Smith
related how he had helped a Pitt
teaching assistant collect insur-
ance for a ‘metal detector. It
seems the teaching" assistant
bought a $250 metal detector to
send to a friend in Iran. The com-
pany agreed to ship. To get the
detector through Iranian customs,
however, the company misrepre-
sented it’s price and only insur-
ed it for $150. The detector was
subsequently lost and the com-
pany refused to absorb the $100
loss until the bureau stepped in
to mediate. The company agreed
to send the Iranian friend another
detector, absorbing what would

have been the teaching assistant’s
$100 loss.

Smith explained that the bur-
eau demands and expects reason-
able restitution in such cases.
Although the bureau has no leg-
al recourse and can only act
as a mediator in disputes between
the consumer and the business-
man, Smith said the bureau’s
name carries considerable weight.

If the consumer decides to take
his complaint to court, the bur-
eau will advise him where to
seek legal counsel (several new
law firms deal exclusively with
such cases) and will testify for
him in court. A bill will soon be
introduced into the state legisla-
ture that seeks to give the bur-
eau full legal powers.

Smith, like Gulak, is a self-,
designed urban affairs major, and
has considered a career in law.

As a learning experience,_Smith
said, the internships are constant-
ly stimulating. He appreciated the

by BOB GING
Chairman Legal Awareness Committee

 In the last week, students at the University have become in-
reasingly aware of the rashof violent crimes happening in and

In Defense of Not Teaching

3 by Dr. STANLEY SHOSTAK
Associate Professor

Every year at about the fifth week of the term
about half of the students enrolled in my course
drift away. Exams in other courses, pressures of
papers,-and personal problems take their toll. I‘m
writing to these students to let them know that the
course continues to go on and will be there when
they are able to make it. I am still not giving
exams, assigning papers, or adding to your personal
discomfort-(I hope) by either attacking your in-

tegrity or self esteem. I suspect, however, that

there may be some other reasons for some stu-
dents to lose interest in a course and I hope that

_this letter can serve to initiate a‘ dialogue about

these reasons. It is only silence that is intolerable.

The remark I hear most often when I eavesdrop
on conversations about my course is that "Shostak
is a joke. He doesn’t teach.” I freely admit to "not
teaching,” but students learn. In a study made fol-
lowing the first time my course was taught
through multi-media, it was demonstrated that my
students performed 7-8 percent better in terms of
their average grade in the next biology course than
did students taking sections of Life Sciences f3O
with other professors (see Life in My Classroom).

_ I did not think,that this was the interesting para-

meter to measure the success of the course, how-
ever. The question I would like to have answered
is, .did- my students enjoy the course and do they
now enjoy their lives more as a result of having
taken the course? '

Another remark I hear is that "the course is

too unstructured,“ and then something like "I‘m
not ready for it.” The problem this raises for me is

sometimes called the double _bind: damned if you

do; damned if you don’t. Since the course is not
unstructured it is ‘bound to be judged badly in
these terms, but even if it were a good unstructur-

ed course, since these students feel that they are ‘

"not ready" for unstructured courses, my course

is bound to fail for them anyway. The onlyway
out of this is to reject the label and the notion of
judging the course. It is really quite an enjoyable
way to spend a Tuesday or Thursday afternoon be-

tween 4-6:0O. Why not just enjoy it and yourself?

Let me explain what I mean by the structure
of the course. The underlying motive and motif
for the course is that an understanding of Darwin-
ian evolutionism (of adaptation through natural sel-
ection) provides a strong basis for rationally choos-
ing how to live, It prescribes the limits and opens
the possibilities for human life for today and into
the future. It has implications for the struggle to
understand aggression, sex and sexism, race and
racism, population dynamics, pollution, bio-engin-
eering, and death. I would hope that by the end
of the course my students will be capable of and
willing to ask the Darwinian questions about what
is happening around and to them, such as, “Since
it exists it must have been adaptive, but to what
is it adaptive?” “Has circumstance changed and is
the ‘adaptation’ no longer promoting survival or
reproduction?” “Should the circumstance be chang-
ed again by rational effort to conform better with
the adaptation?” In my wildest dreams I hope that
each of us, will_ have the awareness and critical
judgment about our lives and circumstances that
Darwin had about his finches. Trying to help you
develop that awareness through multi-media, that
critical judgement through satire and seriousness,
and slipping a Darwinian perspective to you
throughout the course is structure. The insights
and sensitivity acquired by the students’ are not
taught, however, but aided by the environment of
the classroom, or so I hope.

Incidently, the next multi-media presenta-
tion will be on Oct. 24 on the population explos-
ion, andtthen on Nov. 2 on pollution. Other types
of presentations occur at ‘the other'schedu1ed
class meetings. If I don’t see you, have a good
Thanksgiving, and give _it some thought.

    
 

Dear Editor:

To refer to the democratic, re-
publican or communist parties as
defenders of individual liberty or
man’_s rights is a gross- contradic-
tion of terminology. In actuality

what the parties contend is that ‘

a man does not have the right
to live his life for himself .an_d his
family—that he must slave for the
common good, V regardless of
whether or not he recognizes
this goal as cogent. Instead of
the right to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, an American
must proclaim his uniqueness and
value to be nonexistent and lead
a life of self-sacrifice so that
those less fortunate than he may
benefit from his “gifts.” The
major political parties have con-
doned conscription, coercive taxa-
tion, governmental usurption of
businesses, and governmental con-
trol over individual property. It
is vociferously apparent . that
either these political parties have ,
no concept of what a right or of
what individual liberty is, or
that they are striving for a system
of statism and collectivism.

Ralph Palmer
,_ Pitt Students for a
\ Libertarian Society"

Dear Editor:

The absence of any definition
of the concept {‘right,” in the fifth
of the series of political debates
sponsored by the Pitt News, is
perhaps more than eloquent, since

. members of those featured parties

would not recognize a genuine
right,‘if a right were to smack them

across their goddamned faces.

"Rights” are conditions of exist-
ence which permit men to live
and function, in a social context,
as producers, rather than as para-
sites and thieves. “Rights” pertain
to freedom of action, not to objects.
"The right to life,” Ayn Rand
writes. “means that a man has the
right to support his life by his own
work (on any economic level, as
high as his ability will carry him);
it does not mean that others must
provide him with thenecessities
of life.‘-,7 ' C " - " »- I

of happiness, and not of the right
to happiness. Unlike the represen-
tatives of America’s major parties,
Jefferson knew-that no man’s need
constitutes a 1 mortgage on the
lives of other men.

A man whose income and pro-
perty are confiscated by the gov-
ernment (for the sake of those
without income and property)
is a slave. , _

If America's major parties per-
sist indevising “social” programs
that manufacture slaves, I wish
they wouldhave the decency to
name the essence of their schemes
by its proper name.

‘Dear Sir:

. Armed with a morbid sense of
curiosity and a strong stomach, we
were two of the students to take
Szabo Foods up on its offer
(dare?) that.f‘any student brave
enough to tour the cafeteria kit-

chen is welcome to do so."

The ‘-‘Food Forum” was an edu-
cational experience. We learned
the reasons for every complaint
we could think up. For example,
when we asked why there has been
so much sour milk, we received a
reply on the order of 2 “Because
our milkman can’t read expira-
tion dates. Next question?” We
heard little about why it isn’t im-
proved, just why it is poor. ‘

But wait a minute! Who says
the food is poor? Who’s com-
plaining? The total attendance
for the two day program, well ad-
vertised _by a full page spread in
the Pitt News and a poster at the
cafeteria exit, was only ten peo-
ple. Obviously the Pitt student
body loves the food, the dirty
silverware, the monotony. Pardon
me, eat up, don’t let us spoil your
meal. '

However, if you had classes

Letters to the Editor

-wrote of the right to the pursuit

At the forum, the availability of --

managers was stressed. We were
told that any time that we had
any complaints about the food,
we should notify the managers im-
mediately. We urge all unsatis-
fied students to do likewise. ‘

And finally, an article in the
Pitt News on October 9 stated
that two members of the Pitt
Tenant Union are conducting a
petition campaign to initiate an

, student referendum on the Univer-

sity’.s policy of mandatory meal
tickets for dorm students. We do
not know if this program is still
operating, but we would support
it and any similar program, and
urge all resident students to..do.

-likewise. Perhaps if it were a

case of Szabo’s being forced to
sell’ their food rather than our
being forced to buy it, the qual-

ity of the -food service would im- -

prove.

Editor:

I am writing this letter to express
my extreme disgust towards an

organization that is, by its actions 1

taken‘ towards myself and others,
completely hypocritical and close-

- minded. ‘

This organization is the Students
for a Democratic Society. On
Thursday of last week, that is,
October 19th, Donatelli and I
attempted to exercise our freedom
of speech and of the press to dis-
tribute an unfavorable eight page
report concerning the Democratic
candidate for President. When we
went to the Student Union, we
attempted to put out the literature
on the table at the Fifth’ Avenue.
entrance of the Union. Organiza-
tions such as the Citizenship In-

t
’l
«'1

formation Center, Pitt News, and .

even the SDS itself, use this and
other areas around campus to dis-
tribute their “literature.” How-

- ever, we were stopped from doing

so, not by‘ the campus police,

the school administrators, but by
an SDS worker’ who was exercis-
ing his right of free speech and
free press "to hand out anti-
Agnew material. The SDS even
had a table set up nearby, brim-
ming with SDS tabloids and the
like.

The SDS’er took (stole) all our
papers from the free table-and

‘. put them behind the SDS’s table

in clear violation of my Constitu-
tional rights. He also threatened
me by saying that anything else
he found there that didn’-t suit
his ideology would be confiscated.

This SDS is the same organiza-
tion that marches and protests

_ against repression of civil rights

basic to all ‘peoples’. They are
the ones who say that the Gov-
ernment has taken away their
rights.

Well, neigher Donatelli nor I
saw anyauthority whatsoever
attempt to stop them from dis-
tributing their literature in the
Student Union or in Hillman
Library. However, the members
of this hypocritical group tried
to stop me. '

These actions taken against,

no moral or legal basis upon which
they act. They seek only political
power and influence, using any
method posible to obtain their
goals, even methods that oblivate

Dear Sir:

At the risk of sounding like I
have it in for Lynn,dAlstadt. ‘I
must again protest his strange,
reading of the last four years.

The racist dual school system
in the South has been eroded to
the present extent by the pro-
visions of the 1964 (Democratic)
Civil Rights Ac‘t, provisions the
Nixon_administration has fought
to undercut every inch of the way.
Look at the record. Contemporary
victims of the Nixon reign like
the black parents in 16 Southern
school districts in seven states ac-
tually had to sue the Attorney.Gen-
eral to force him to do what he
was mandated by law to do in
the first place: enforce the. law.
Time and again, it has been that
separate power, thecourt system,
which has shielded citizens from
the Nixon onslaught on civil
rights (perhaps it‘s not surprising
that the court system is the major
institution that, Nixon is trying
to .gut and drain today). A law-
yer’s group recently charged the
Administration with (a) permit-
ting school districts to practice
segregation within a school even

though the school was nominally '
desegregated (As Sen. Mondale -

has observed, the only thing inte-
grated in many southern schools
today is thefront door ), and (b)
standing by while black educa-

‘tors (5,000 according to the Na-

tional Education Association) were

gated all schools in districts with
some desegregation, rather than
using the school-by-school criter-
ion. Thus, black pupils in all-
black schools in an “integrated"
district in Columbia, S.C., for
example. are counted as attending
desegrated schools.

Ten black lawyers out of the
almost 2/3 of the Justice Depart-
ment’s Civil Rights Division law-

yers who publicly protested Nixon’s

rollback of the civil rights move-

ment perhaps said it best: "We _

are indeed observing a metamor-
phoasis during which ‘benign neg-
lect’ is being transformed into
Malignant hypocrisy.” Undet the
circumstances, it is not surprising
that busing is being resorted to.
Sadly, it may be the last stand

_ against‘Nixonian egalitarianism.

Finally, Alstadt's comments on
quotas reveal the tiresome Re-
publican inability to make funda-
mental distinctions. The merit
system is a principle on which both
Nixon (rhetorically) and McGov-

V ern agree; McGovern’s quota ap-

proach for the Democratic Conven-
tion was a tool, a’ temporary com-
promise with one principle in
order to further another prin-
ciple that was directly involved
with an urgent national problem:

the lack of fair representation of
minorities in either political-party.
The result of using this tool was
to produce more people at the con-
vention that were truly represent-

ative of“the minorities in each

state; people who were, ironically
perhaps to those opposed to quotas,‘
mlre "qualified.” ’

Giving a wild, leprechaun touch

Fantasies oi ‘Fantasia’

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Arts Editor

Viewing the cinematic classics
of the past has become one of the
proper things that must be done
by today’s movie enthusiast, and
the revival of such classics very
often grosses satisfying financial.
results at the box office as well.
With these two points in mind,
the nth revival of Walt Disne_v‘s
"F‘antasia’_’ at the Guild comes as
no surprise. A

Billed as "the greatest animated
feature of all time," the film pro-
vides through both music and ani-
mated cartoon techniques, a de-
lightful "trip" of amazing aesthetic
success. I was impressed with this
film as a child and have remained
impressed, especially after my lat-
est exposure to it.

Produced during the early 40’s,
a film of the artistic creativity of
Fantasia will very rarely be
matched again (no doubt one of

the reasons why it keeps return- ,

ing to “haunt” us). In the film,
various works of the repertoire
have been taken and applied to

different situations: Stravinsky’s

‘Sacre’ becomes a backdrop for

_the story of terrestrial evolution,

the Beethoven “Pastoral’ provides
musical accompaniment for ‘the
frolics and wanderings of myth-
ological creatures, and of course,
Dukas’ Sorcerer's Apprentice por-
trays the story of the lazy appren-

  Continue to Entertain

tice with that oscar winning car-
toon character, Mickey Mouse.

Mr. Mouse’s performance is
certainly deserving of the laud it
has received over the past years.
Due to his masterful appearance
in the film, the Dukas‘ composi-
tion has become more widely
known than it may otherwise
have been without its ‘plug’ in
"Fantasia." While this very well
sound ‘exaggerated, this particular
sequence is almost always men-
tioned in program notes on the
Dukas'work. V

One can hardly help but marvel
at the cinematic expertise display-
ed in this film, especially when its
date of release is recalled. Even
though the soundtrack is a bit
scratchy, the animated sequences
are beautifully done. The music
throughout is provided by Leopold
Stokowski and the Philadelphia
Orchestra, a group which has evi-
dently improved since the making
of the film. "

Andbesides all the fine music

and animation, there is often rib-
tickling humor. First prize in this
department still goes to the corps
de ballet of elephants, ostriches,
crocodiles, and hippopotami who
__dance themselves into ecstasy
-during the Dance of the Hours
sequence. It still leaves many a
viewer rolling in the aisles to see
this gravity defying performance
on thescreen. ‘

Even though many purists may

5 be insulted - by the sensational

cuts in many of the longer com-
positions included in “Fantasia,”

' they should not let this deter them.

There is much enjoyment here for
everyone, especially for ,the car-
toon buff and the devoted enthu-

rsiast of serious music. “Fantasia”
is great fun all around and should
not be missed. '

From one beer lover to another. a

by JIM RETHI

_ What does a modern office coin-
plex in a building facing Pitts-
burgh's gray Monongahela and a
population of resurrected ghouls
who wander about looking for
people——to eat—have in common?

Those who stay for second t'ea- \

tures at drive-ins. or who are up
’on first class horor flicks, may
recognize the ghouls as the basic
premise behind a film they vivid-
ly remember——a ghastly tale called
The Night of the Living Dead.

Those who read the credits to
the film probably remember that
it was made by an organization
called The Latent Image——located
where?. . . yes, in Pittsburgh in
a modern office comples on the
banks of the Monongahela.

Latent Image is an independ-
ent film producing corporation
that, since its founding ten years
ago by four men interested in
film production, has made com-.
mercial, educational, industrial,

‘ and more recently entertainment ’

motion pictures. Although most of
their business still comes under
the first three categories, it is
the entertainment pictures that

__....\the people at Latent Image talk

' about, and shots from them cover

the walls of their offices.

In an interview, Bill Hinzman,
one of the founders of Latent
Image, talked about producing

' feature films. “We pick people

who are able to do everything,”
he said. The average crew size
for one of their features consists
of ten to twelve people. “Versa-
tile people,” said Hinzman. He
"explained that any one staff mem-
ber has many jobs—the director
does camera work, the cameramen
do the editing, and everyone car-
ries equipment. In this way, costs
arre kept down to a minimum,
which is important to any com-

__,_.__,pany that describes itself as “low

budget.” .- S _
It takes about six weeks for

- Latent Image to shoot a feature,

and another six to eight to edit it
and do the musical score’..When.
it is completed, the company tries
to sell it through an agent _to a
distributor. who takes it from
there.

Sometimes. the distributor is

one of the original investors in
the film, as with Latent Images
latest production. Hinzman re-
lated that this is a more satisfac-
tory arrangement.

Night of the Living Dead, made
in 1968 and the organizations first
entertainment feature, didn’t make
much noise in the film world when
it was released that year. But then
a film made for $184,000 in Pitts-
burgh doesn‘t get the promotion
that a multi-million dollar Holly-
wood flick gets.

So it went underground—second
features at drive-ins, midnight
horror shows for cultists of that
genre—and struggled for recogni-
tion from the bottom up.

It got it. Profits from the film
now total in the millions and it
is viewed with terrified delight
by horror fans internationally.
Newsweek has called it a “true
horror classic,” and Rex Reed
said,“It scared the living day-
lights out of me.”

Since NOTLD, the companv has
done three more features: The
Affair, about a middle class
American romance. Jack’s Wife,
about -witchcraft in surburbia,
and, The Crazies, which deals with
biological warfare and civil war in
a small Western Pennsylvania com-
munity, and has a "strong anti-war
message.”

Asked about.the trend toward

smaller film producers and the
decline of Hollywood’s motion pic-

ture dictatorship,~ Hinzman said, I

"Hollywood producers, with unions
and high costs, have pushed them-

- selves out of business. But I think

they’re changing this.” He cited
several recent low budget films
which have won high acclaim:
The Graduate’ — "first example
of a low budget film with unknown
actors grossing a lot of money,”
The French Connection and David
and Lisa.

,Except for Crazies, for which
the company hired six profession-
al actors from New York, Latent
Image has used all local acting
talent in their feature productions.
All scenes and settings have been
in Western Pennsylvania too.

Local Film Industry Grows

scenes in the same movie were
shot right in the basement of the
building where their offices now
are.

Bill Hinzman, who attended
Pitt’s Career Seminars this fall,
was very interested in talking
about the chances of local stu-
dents becoming involved in films.

"The opportunity for someone
to get involved in the industry is
greater than ever before," he
said. But you can’t just come
breezing into a place like Latent
Image and expect a job.

Hinzman encourages independ-
ent undertakings, and stated, ‘ ‘The
best way for someone to become
-involved in the industry is to pro-

duce a film _of his own." With a

film of your own under your arm,
you’ve got something_to show for
yourself. Says Hinzman, "The big ,
thing you need is dedication.”

By any standard The Latent

‘Image is a successful outfit. They

are currently involved in negoti-
ations to do three more features
over the next three year period.

Near the end of the interview,
Hinzman. looked reflective as-
he drew on his every-present men-
thol cigarette. “It’s been along
uphill struggle,” he said. “What
we wanted to do was bring a

motion picture production house 

into Pittsburgh. . . we’ve done it.”

t7_,- I-fam convinced that all worked

oducts "of Pittsburgh is a mania -

rolled steel products.

"To Be Free” is a Joe Magarac.
lnc. production. Written. pro-
duced and directed by a. cer-
tain Ned Bosnick and released by
the Magarac Company. I sus-
pect Mr. Bosnick of inventing
both the «Company and the lnc..
but, with the titles he claims. he
is eligible. for as much blame as
any human deserves.

The film begins with titles su-
perimposed over paintings done
mostly in primary colors. The
purist‘ might find himself distract-
ed from the graphics by-the infor-
mation in the titles. No problem.
The paintings reappear regularly.
The writer. producer, etc. com-
missioned them especially for
his rnovie. ,

A girl appears. interspersed
with cuts taken from the middle
of the film, She is Carole. in real
life. 1 Barbara Douglas.

At t the

end of the show she tells us her
name is Carole Jones.

She was in the lobby before
the showing, but not, after it.
I think she understands this film.
In it, she gives the impression
she was trying to, or obliged to,
play the character of Carole as
a porcelain figurine. The effect

-is more like Melmac. She‘ is

engaged to Bruce (blandly im-
personated by Dick Decoit),
who would like to sleep with
her. She would rather not.

. For this reason. she turns up
in the office of Dr. Keith. a psy-'
chiatrist. We eventually learn that
Carole's mother has a.miserable
sex-life. which she hopes to
pass on to her daughter, and

‘that Carole lives "in an apart-

ment with another girl.”How
she supports herself remains a
mystery.

R amp am‘ In Film 'sPre‘mieret.  

Mostly. she gambels around
in meadows. ’
Mr. Bosnick must have seen a

lot of movies lately, including"

Dr. Zhivago and Love Story. His
heroine gambols in a lot of
fields. including, ,_to the unprac-
ticed eye, wheat, scrubgrass, and
one consisting entirely of flowers.
Sometimes she takes her shirt off.

My bus has a speedometer which
reads up to eighty miles an hour;
this film has a “R" rating. Both
are unnecessary. but nice to
have, just in case.

Back to the plot. The girl is
promptly hypnotized by her
psychiatrist, using a method a
friend of mine who should know
says could not work. She is ad-
vised to tense her whole body,
relax, and then think about her
big toe, arch, ankle, and so forth
relaxing. She is promtply in a
deep trance. ‘ 1

On the verge of setting an -all-
time record losing streak at 11
games, the Pitt Panther football
team roared to three fourth quar-
ter touchdowns to win their first
game of the season, Saturday at
Pitt Stadium.

Joe Ykikca’s Boston College
Eatles were the victims of the
Cats highest offensive output so
far. And, the 18,116 fans
loved all of it.

The very hungry Pittsburghers
put _together four good quarters

Pitt back to eclipse the century
mark in rushing this year. Os-
trowski ran for 101 yards on 25
attempts and the offense as a
whole accumulated 277 yards on
the ground. To compliment this,
John Hogan called on his strong
right arm for 268 passing yards.

it was Hogan who hit Todd
Toerper with a screen pass on the
Pitt 22 early in the second quarter
and watched his split end do some
smart, tackle breaking running to
the Boston 29 yard line. The Cats
edged their way into the end-
zone from there, with Ostrowski
taking it in from the one. Eric

next to the bench. It was as good a time as any for‘~an 0-6
football team to pull a win off and it was assistant coach’s,
Steve Petro’s birthday. ,

It was quite a day last Saturday, a type of day a football.
team would like tohave 11 times a year. For the Pitt Pan,
thers it was the best day they have had in 1972 and their fac-
 in the locker room afterward proudly proclaimedit.

The Panthers had defeated the Boston College Eagles 35-

 ‘20 and there wasn’t a face to be found on the Pitt side of

dressing room that didn.’t wear a broad smile.

Todd Toerper lay on a training table with
a hip pointer, an injury, sustained in the just
completed game, and a smile-almost as big
as the ice pack strapped to his body.

Clair Wilson seemed to be walking on‘
some kind of a’ cloud and Stan Ostrowski
found time to shake a reporter’s hand, while

Webster had just spent as rough an afternoon as an offen-
sive guard could expect to have. He was sitting on another
training table with an ice pack on his knee, an ice pack on
his ankle, and an ice pack sitting on his lap, with’ one wrist

below it and the other above. 1

Jim Buckmon was so estatic he" answered in two words .

when questioned by a reporter, instead of his customary one.
Amazingwhat winning a football game can do for a group of
men.

U_p.stairs, in the coaches dressing room, every one was
walking around like they had just heard the world’s funniest
joke. Petro was passing out Dr. Good to both commemerate
the win and his birthday and Carl De Pasqua was trying not
to act too excited. A Pitt alumni had worked his way in with
‘an open umbrella singing: “Hail to Pitt all ye loyal sons."

Paul Kemp, Who coaches the offensive backs had per-
haps the biggest smile of all. His runners had just accounted
for 400 of the 545 total yards and almost unbelievingly, he
clutched the stat sheet that proved the fact.

As Carl De Pasqua sat on a folding chair,_ seeming to
ac in no hurry to shower, a reporter chided him about the
ore of the game..

After being accused of running up the score, De Pasqua
burst into a-burly laugh before answering.

“It was a long time coming," he said. “Everything
blended in together beautifully.”

“That’s what I used to have at Waynesburg (he coached
Waynesburg College),” he remarked about the very potent
Pitt offense, this day. “A well balanced attack.”

“Viewing the thing prospectively, one still has to real-
ize that the Cats have a 1-6 record. That to make a come-
back they must repat the performance the rest of the season.
But, as they say, it was a step in the right direction.

Leaving the Pitt party, the sad faces of the Boston Col-
lege athletes were met as they boarded the bus back to their
hotel. Their faces weren’t smiling. They had the look of "a
V team that had just been thrashed. ‘

At this point, the game seemed
to be turning into and offensive

the ensuing ‘kickoff to go back

In that 10 play drive, covering
79 yards, Marangi did some nifty

halfback Phil Bennet, made it
look easy. Running for 14 yards,
Marangi hit on passes to Dave
Bucci and Briggs. Bucci‘s recep-

near miraculous catch at the Bos-

coming up with a 35 yard gainer.

Then, it looked like misfortune
was again working its way back
into the Pitt backfield. Scramb-
ling wildly "in his own back-
field, Hogan let loose a pass for
the Boston College endzone. Pitt
was called for illegal receiver

both as a 15 yard penalty and a
loss of the second down.

more important, for the first down.

"There was no way I was’ going

The two point conversion was

That score came when Ostrowski,
who was voted the game’s most
valuable player in the press box,
battled hiw way five yards into

‘When You Win

by RON SIEGEL

A strange thing happened late Saturday after-
noon at Pitt Stadium. For the first time in nearly
’ a year, the scoreboard showed Pitt had more points
- than their opponent at the conclusion of the game.

But this wasntthe only unusual occurence.
Winning _football, even one game, can uplift the
whole area. People were staying to listen to the
band long after the final gun. Others were running
and dancipgon the Astroturf.

‘The scene in the Pitt locker room gave the
appearance of a team that had just won a cham-
pionship. The enthusiasism of‘ course spread to
the Pitt coaches as well.

“It’s been a long time coming,”exclaimed head
’ coach Carl DePasqua, “It feels really great.”
Winning the game was not an easy chore. It took
‘an amazingly potent offense that netted 545 yards
total offense. It was because the offense was able
,:to move the ball so well. as well as the stinginess
- of the defense. that netted the Panthers a victory.

' ' The only area where Pitt was ineffective was

all of them were deflected or nearly deflected, and
‘this put the pressure on the defense to hold the
Golden Eagles, which they did when they had to.

. ‘Both DePasqua and Boston College head
{coach Joe Yukica ‘agreed that the turning point
‘in the game came late in the fourth quarter, soon
"after Pitt had taken the lead for the first time,
'21-20 on an eighty yard drive. 3

A After taking over on the Pitt 48, courtesy of a
Tim Hornish punt that went.out of bounds. Boston
College desperately attempted to move into
field"-goal range. ,

Things Are Really Different

with 101 yards on 25 carries.

John Hogan played the entire game at quarter-
back, and completed 16 of 27 passes. Hogan injur-
ed his elbow during the game. but stayed in. Two
of his passes were picked off deep in BC territory,
preventing scores.

"It really feels great—something I haven’t felt
for a long time,” enthused Ostrowski,” Individual-
l-y I had a good game, but it was a great team ef-
fort that won the game,’ we made a lot of clutch
plays.

DePasqua echoed Ostrowski’s sentiments. “Hogan
did a great job; Murphy, Wilson, Ostrowski, Toerper,
and Wall all made clutchplays; Everything blend-
ed in together well.” . -

"Pitt deserved to win,” noted a dejected BC
coach Yukica.” They controlled the ball. We had
a chance to come back at 21-20, but Buckmon pick
ed off that pass.” - ‘

Clair Wilson, who finished the _day with 63
yards and one TD. also credited the victory to a
team effort." It really felt great to score, but
we finally got a good team effort. "Looking ahead
to next week's game with Syracuse, Wilson de-
clared, “It‘s going to be a tough game. but if
we don‘t make many mistakes. we should win it."

.The team finally won their first game, and many
people saw it coming after last week's Notre Dame
game. The BC game served to illustrate that a team
can benefit and show promise despite .\ losing the
weekbefore. 42-16.

The clock will start October 27 with the first shot downrange
for the newly reorganized Pdtt Rifle Squad, as they meet Washington

and Jefferson Community College.

The match will be held at 6 p.m. in Trees Hall.

Returning for the Pitt marksmen are veterans Howard Ashbrook,
team captain. Jim Gray. co-captain. Jay Friedburg, Rich Cygremus,
and John Filby. They will be joined by newcomers Tom Tomi, Tom
East, John Cenkner. Natalie Kuzmich, and Mark Himler.

Other newcomers to the squad are advisor Captain Ebitz and
coach Sargeant Hawks. These men, along with Colonel Mishtowt of
the Department of Military Science, were instrumental in the or-

ganization of this year’s team.

“The team is now a recognized student activity, sponsored by the
military science department," Ebitz stated. “It is open to all interest- _
ed undergraduates. Thus far, student interest has been excellent and

the outlook for this season is bright."

A number of Pitt women have displayed an interest in the “firing
squad" for the first time. Natalie Kizmich, a pharmacy student. will
be the first female competitor for the Pitt squad.

3 Upsets Upset Yogis-

A disastrous week struck the
Pitt News Yogis, and although the
standings remained the same,
several yogis were moaning about
their winning percentages, as well
as the passing up of a chance to
catch that arch-villain resident of
first place, Rupert Buccigrossi. '

Rupert posted an unimpressive
score of 10-5, but in a week of
upsets," it was as good as anybody
else’s score. As a result, she
opened up her lead on runnerup
Souvenir Siegel by six games. As
the season moves into the second
half, people .will begin to get
desperate and Rupert should’ be
able to hold that lead.

Meanwhile. the gap from fifth
to sixth place expanded, as Schmel-
vin Meltzer opened his lead on
Gazebo DiNardo and Rosey Rosen-
thal to five. Big Mack tied with
Poor Euler for last place, has
given up on this year, but vows_

he will win it all next year.

The games that surprised all of
the Yogis, as well as most of the
nation, were Navy upsetting Air
Force, ‘ 21-17; 20-point underdog
Colorado upsetting top-ranked
Oklahoma; and Missouri's 30-26
upset of Notre Dame. 6

Another game which fooled all
but one Yogi was Florida’s upset
of Mississippi. What was also
surprising was that Poor Euler,
who ‘usually picks the incredible
upsets (that don’t occurl failed to
pick any this week. '

 Boaters Sing RoadBIues

by BART MACK

The worst is over for the Pitt
Soccer Team, as far as their road
schedule is concerned that is. The
booters were defeated by Cleve-
land State, 3-1, Saturday, thus
dropping their third game out of
seven contests so far this year.
All of those losses have been on
the road.

Pitt made it a close contest,
however, as Cleveland could
manage only one goal in the first
half. Eugene Vasseu, who holds
the Ohio varsity record for assists
in one game, tallied the score on
a cornerkick that eluded the Pitt
defense. Vasseu had the ball to
himself after it squibbed by two
Pitt fullbacks and beat goalie
Bill Haines cleanly.

Vasseu is only one of the many
international players that fill the
Cleveland roster, and like the
University of Akron, those inter-
national recruits were too much
for Pitt to handle.

“They’re just as skilled as
Akron,”' Pitt coach Leo Bemis
stated. “I’d say they're better
shooters than Akron. Anyone on

,\the Cleveland line could shoot.
'7 I’d say they (Cleveland) are bet-

ter b‘alanced.’?

HAPP'NESS

 

 
  
  

Ray Rex put.the booters back
in the game with a goal in the
early going of the second half.
Rex, crusing down on the right
wing, lofted a shot that curved
past Cleveland goalie Ihor Zyga,
giving him his third goal of the
season.

But the Cleveland booters didn't
let up and kept the pressure on.
Vleveland added a goal midway
through the second half and held
Pitt off the scoreboard through the
remainder of the game. Roman
Rousul gave Cleveland more than
enough insurance with a goal in
the final minutes of play.

It was another case of not en-
ough offense for Pitt and some

sloppy midfield play that put

the booters on the short end of
the score. Cleveland also used
their familiarity of their home
field to their advantage.

The game was originally sched-
uled to be played on the Cleve-
land artificial turf field, but was
switched to a grass location. The

:Pitt squad did not find the field
to their liking at all.

"It was avery rough field,”
Bemis remarked. "Cleveland trap-
ped and passed very well on it.“

On the other hand, Pitt full-
back Fernando Carriquiry claim-
ed that “the rough field only
made our mistakes more obvi-

ous.”

"We just couldn’t get an of-
fensegenerated that was worth
that much," Bemis lamented.

That sputtering offense suffer-
ed more than just a defeat on Sat-
urday. Forward Tony Bolea, one
of the few members of the Pitt
forward line that had much ex-
perience, was lost for the re-

[3 Disability Plan

By RICK EULER

The argument over who is the real champion
of the intra—mural softball competition will have
to go on indefinitely—or at least until next spring.

Plagued by a lack of time and cooperation, the
intramural department was unable to organize any
playoff system to determine a single champion.

Jay Leiendecker of the intramural office ex-
plained that due to the large number of postpone-
ments. there was not enough time to hold an eli-
mination tournament.

Leiendecker and Jerry Noviello. also of the IM
department. then set up a make-shift tournament.
hand-picking teams'from each division. The teams
were to have been: the Charlie Browns and For-
rest’s Fires of the Health Professions, Psychology
and Economics from’the Grad-Fac division, the
Pack and AFROTC from the Independents, Suth-

erland from the Dorms. PKA from the Fraternity .

Division and PESA of the Club League. This set-
up overlooked several undefeated teams including
Hauck’s Raiders, Corporate Veil, and the Electri-
cal Engineers.

"We tried to base our decisions on the teams
record. their margins of victory, and the amount
of time they had playeditogether." Leindecker
said. "Some of these teams are practically made
up of the -same players year after year and this
‘gives them an advantage in experience."

The tournament. to have been played last week-
end, never came off.

“We ran into a problem of conflicting sched-
ules," said Leiendecker. “No team could have
all of its players there at the necessary time. so
we decided it; would be best to call the whole
thing off.” —

IM director Leo Bemis stated that the playoffs
might be played next spring if the teams would be
willing to wait that long. '

"Of course, interest might lag in that time. or
teams might fall apart." Bemis noted. However.
he refused to commit himself on the feasibility
of this plan.

Another problem the 'IM department faced
was that of officiating. Leiendecker pointed out
that the trend in the Pitt program has been more
and towards playing for recreation than for com-
petition.

"To have regular officials for every game in-
volves a large amount of money." he explain-
ed.‘ “And it seems as though we’re‘ better off hav-
ing no officials at all than to lookafor students.”

Leiendecker did admit, however. that in some
sports. such as wrestling, there is no way to get
around the need for officiating.

"We have examples of many other programs
around the country which have been very success-
ful without officiating,” he added.

This week. the softball competition gives way

to touch football, and the IM crew is hopeful that"

weather and scheduling will be on their side this
time.

Following are the standings for the softball
competition back Tony Seethaler, A third touch-
down also came on a run as the snow and mud
slowed both teams. —

The Corporate Veil opened defense on their

Grad-Fac championship last night in the snow
and rain at Pitt Stadium by overwhelming Martv

‘s 24-0. The Veil was led by quarterback Pete "

(Pancho) Smith, who connected’ with Mike King,
Jon Marti and Chip Babst on scoring strikes of 12,
14. and 34 yards respectively. The Veil defense,
anchored by linebacker Eric Anderson, was never
pierced. The Marty Z’s were held to minus yard-
age and only one first down.

How come I can't get a close shave?

How come my chin and upper lip are
harderto shave?

How come I get a lot of irritation and
' nicks? ' -

Some“l-low comes?”      
about shaving, answered:

Whatever bugs you about shaving,
ENGLISH LEATHER POWER FOAM SHAVE CREAM
can help de—bug it. We know shaving won’t ever be fun.But at least
we can help make it a little nicer to face the day.

5   English lleather.

Maybe you should take your
clothes off first. Showering
before you shave will soften your
beard even more. Lots of hot
water and soap is the key to a
better shave.

That's where whiskers grow the
most. Always shave there last.
The longer lather is on whiskers,
the softer they become.

Every stroke of your razor
scrapes away skin cells. So use
gentle strokes (and as few as
possible) in the direction your
beard grows. Never press too
hard with your razor.
