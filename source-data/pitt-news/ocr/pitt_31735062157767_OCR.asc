T SCALPING OURS/IVELVES

Twice a year an attractive- basketball game is scheduled
for Pitt Pa.vilion—when West Virginia and Westminster send
their eager-to-knock-oft’-the-Panthers 'quintets to Pittsburgh.

The 2600 student ticketsdistributed at the University are
grabbed up rapidly during the exchange period, none left for
sale to the general public. - - G

Since full houses and scalping go hand-in-hand, several

, hundred pasteboards for the Westminster‘ game last Saturday

were peddled by students to.an Oakland operator, who had
his scalpers scouring DeS0ta Street for prospective buyers of
-these “free” tickets. ' "

This throws a bad light on the University, and athletic
ofﬁcials.don’t like the glare. Graduate Manager Frank_CarVer
indicates that the entire ticket exchange, a nuisance the ath-
letic department has tolerated for mhny years, may be stopped,
it‘ further evidence of student ticket sales turns up.

A threatened loss of a s_emi—privilege should be enough of
a warning, they hope.

the conclusion of the past semester. In order to
facilitate reading and to provide a chronological or-
der, this report is prepared and presented in min-
ute form.

Call to Order :" r

_ Our meetings are called to order in the Dean

dral of Learning, every Monday. Those‘ present

Reports—- . ,
'Vice President and Activities Committee
_ Report:

The. Vice President of Student Congress ‘is
Chairman of the Activities Committee, which in
turn is divided into two sub—committees, the Ap-
pointments Committee and the Social Committee.
Sam Simpson has been working hard with his two
sub-committees this year. hi order to facilitate
reading and understanding, we shall consider the
two sub-committees separately. ‘

« Appointments Committee Report: ,
Bob Silberstein and the members of his‘
committee have been quite busy all year with
' appointments for the four school daiﬁzes spon-
sored by Student Congress. ..This committee
has appointed chairmen and Business Managers
for the Soph Hop, Junior Prom, and Freshman
Dance. Interviewing applicants for these posi-
tions is _time consuming and demands objec-
-tive thought of this committee in choosing
candidates. This committee must yet appoint
a. chairman, Bus. Mgr., and Publicity Chairman
for Scholar Days chairman, business manager
and publicity chairman for next year’s Spring
Festival, and the chairman, Business Manager
and Publicity Chairman for Scholars Day.

Social Committee Report:

This committee, headed by Dave: Fox, has
been busy during -.the past semester rewriting
the social regulation of Student C0_ngr,ess»and
has the power to enforce these rules. From the
University social Committee has secured mid-
night privileges for Pharmacy School social
affairs during the week. The Student Con-
gress Committee also‘ secured the right to
grant special privileges for social affairs as
regards-—“to time,’ ‘and place of the events.”

This committee held one tea. dance last
semester on Friday, October 1, the ‘day pre-

ceding ‘the Notre Dame football game. The
dance was a ﬁnancial loss of $236.00. The com-
mittee is studying plans for "tea dances of a.
different nature for this seinester. Dave and
the members of his committee spend a large
part of their time reviewing ‘petitions sub-
mitted by various organizations seeking per-
mission to conduct social affairs one the campus.

. Secretaries’ Reports: ’ _-

To Flora
the thankless jobs of preparing minutes and cor-
respondence. Congressowes them a debt of thanks

for their diligent work.

Treasurer’s Report:

Bob Kingsley has worried over our budget of

$1800.00, which must cover all Congress expenses.
The appropriation is divided into two parts:
$900.00 for an assembly program, and $900.00 for
all other Student Congress expenses.

Assemblies Committee Report:

Pat Leix and her committee are responsible for
all student assemblies and pep-rallies. No assemb-
lies were held last semester. During the football
season six pep—rallies were held: Friday night be-
fore the Notre Dame game, Monday "following
the West Virginia game, Friday before and Mon-
day following the Indiana game, Thursday before
and Monday after the Penn State game. Student
Congress was quite discouraged with the attend-
ance at the pre-game rallies but would like to
thank the students for their cooperation during
the victory rallies. Pat and her committee‘ have
made plans for at least two major assemblies this
semester with two prominent speakers.

Throughout the term’. partici-
pants must live in the Webster

munity as a factory” is the phrase
of Dean Lanfear of the School of
Business Administration. ,

After careful study by the par-
ticipants, the cases will be dis-
cussed under the leadership of a.

As Panthers Drop

 

mmy David Breaks Record

Cose One

By MYRON KOPELMAN.

Pitt ’s Panthers today were looking forward to their last
opportunity of the season to spring an upset. The Panthers
Were edged out by \Vest Virginia, 54-51, "Wednesday night,
but the two teams meet at Morgantown again on March 5.

None of the Panthers had to
bow their heads for their Wednes-
day night performances. Sammy
David, truly a great marksman
broke the all-time Pitt scoring
record of 314 points in one season
by scoring 18 and running his

own total to 317. The old record.

set two decades ago by Charlie
Hyatt, seerns destined to be over-
shadowed substantially, for _Sam-
my has four games left to play.

Dodo Canterna, always danger-
ous against the Mountaineers.
matched David with 18 points ‘of
his own.

Although you had to give the

Panthers a lot of credit for bat—’

tling the bigger West Virginians
down to the ﬁnal gun, the fact.re-
mains that the Pitts muffed many
an opportunity to win the game.
They made only 15 out of 25
free throws, "and eight of these

were sunk by one man, Canterna.

And several easy laylup shots
were embarrassingly missed. Still,
a player such as Bimbo Cecconi,
for example, is entitled to an oc-
casional boner when he is holding
his own with—men two heads tall-
er, as he did against the Moun-
tainers.

Missing‘ a trip to the London

 Helwas also New England AAU
titlist in these two events. His

 - achievements had proved him to
‘be Olympic material, but heart-

breakers do come up, and this one
to Miller was twelve inches long.
“I missed the team by afoot,
but it may as well have been an

ful star. a“I came in ﬁfth, and

A fourth‘ position was needed to

Bob’s . home is in Warwick,
Rhode Island, where he was a
six-letter man in high school, and

the all—state selection at tackle.

‘He entered college at Boston
University, playing basketball and
making the track team while
there. ‘ '  '
. A 37-month Navy enlistment in-
terrupted college. He changed his
calling address to Rhode, Island
State after discharge. ’ ”

At Rhode Island the 200-pound-

. er switched to end in football, and
played that position for three .

years. It was also at Rhode Island

How Du Pont scientists
found a way to
ﬂMoistureproof Cellophane

There’s' no secret to Du Pont’s suc-
cessful system for making chemical
- discoveries. It is simply research
. through teamwork. ‘ ‘ ‘
_ As each new problem in research
if ' arises, it is tackled by men’ and
 -  women whose training and skill qual-
~' l ify them to master it. Backed by
ample funds and facilities, they are
continuously extending the ﬁeld~of
scientiﬁc knowledge.

Take the case of moistureproof
Cellophane. Plain, transparent Cello-
phane was strong, clear and protec-
-tive. As a packaging material it had
eye appeal. Its uses were limited,
however. Perishable foods wrapped
in this cellulose ﬁlm were protected
from contamination and were good
to look at, but they did not retain
their freslmess. They either lost or
absorbed moisture, depending on the
nature of the food and atmospheric
conditions. ,

That was a challenge to Du Pont
research people. They set out to ﬁnd
materials that would moistureproof
‘Cellophane without materially af-
,_ ' fecting its thinness or transparency.

ure moistureproofness, they. tried
various procedures—adding ingredi-

ents to Cellophane dope before cast- ’
ing, impregnating sheets in baths

and coating the ﬁlm.

Coating showed the most promise.
. Had you been a member of the re-

search team on this job, you might‘
have helped ‘mix and test several"

hundred different coating formulae
over a 10 months’ period. With suc-
cessful coatings in sight, a .small
pilot operation was set up. Then-
to make sure the new Cellophane
was right—doughnuts, cookies and
cakes were wrapped in it and sent
to market. Finally, engineers were
called on to design machinery for
full-scale operation.

Now everything from chewing gum
to porterhouse steaks is being sold in
moistureproof Cellophane. Another
scientiﬁc achievement is helping
change the food packaging and food
buying habits of America!
