A “Even though I’m‘a guy,_I.can still relate

to what females go through,” Lamm said.g- ,

Lamm, who graduated from Pitt in 2011 with

. a marketing degree, created a doll with the
’ brand name Lammily. He used average body

proportions for a 19-year-old woman from
the Centers for Disease Control to promote
“a more realistic standard of beauty.” The

' name Lammily is not the doll’s name, Lamm

said, because children can instead name the
doll themselves.‘ \

‘ Lamm hopesfto release his doll, which is
available for pre-order on his website, in retail
storesby early next year, though no plans are
currently solidiﬁed.

Lam_m’s doll is a brunette, wears “minimal

makeup,” denim shorts, a casual top and white.

sneakers, compared to the glittery dresses,
dramatic makeup and high heels typically
worn by currently available dolls.

Body image andselfiesteemare important

. issues for Lamm, 25, who recalled picking out '

a doll for his niece afew years ago and noticing
how strange the doll’s body proportions and
tiny waist looked. V

“Fashion dolls are symbolic of the impos-

sible beauty standards that you see all around _

women’s studies professor, pointed to the

. “If the standard is really high, [to the point]
that it’s actually unreachable, then it’s great for

marketingproducts because the pursuit of the
product is continuous,” she said. °

Over the last year, Lamm’s projects have
reﬂected a growing interest in how dolls look

V compared to the average person.

Last October," he published his “normal
bodies” project, a series of images that used
three-dimensional body mapping to create
animated representations of what the average
human male looks like,‘ on his website. Last

“When we play with things, when we inter-
actwith things, Ifeel like they subconsciously

inﬂuence us,” Lamm said.

Heidi Bertels, aformer Pitt'professor_who
taught Lamrn in an entrepren ' ‘rial process
class, said Lamm’s projectis aste inthe right
directionfor positively inﬂuencingyoung chil-
dren, speciﬁcally young girls. ‘

“I think both men and women would like
to see a healthier Barbie,” Bertels said. “I think
a lot of parents would encourage their kids to
play with the realistic Barbie.”

Bertels, who now teaches innovation
management and entrepreneurship at City
University of New York-Staten Island, said
she was not surprised that a project like this
from Lammbecame popularwith mass media
and that he is “doing the right things” to get
the attention. — _

Lamm used Crowdtilt, an online program
that helps users fundraise for a project or
event, to raise the money to _make his doll. He
sold more than 16,000 preorders of the doll
to generate more funding to pay for manu-

facturing.

Bertels recalled teaching techniqueslike
these in her Pitt class years ago, and Lamm
said his marketing education at Pitt gave
him the foundation he needed to have such
aunique career. '

“I remember Googling ‘what should I do
with the rest of my life’ on the bus home,”
Lamm said,‘ remembering his ﬁrst day at a
marketing job out of college. “If you want to
do something different you have to start now.”

After studying entrepreneurship, working
a “typical” job did not appeal to Lamm at all.
‘ _ Instead, he monitors media trends and
produces graphic art based on research and

data. Before startingthe Lamrnily project, he -
worked on a map of the United States that '

highlighted the best places to go in the event
of a zombie apocalypse. He had to temporar-

ily abandon that project in order to pursue '
' Larmnily. ‘

“An impression I got from Nick in class
was that he was certainly a little different,”‘
Bertels said. “He stood out. He had a different
way of thinking.Agood entrepreneurcansee
an opportunity.” ’ . . .

Lamm plans to create a whole line of

shapes —- and a male companion doll — to

keep changing the beauty standards that our

children’s toys reﬂect. _

“It is just a toy, but there are things out
there that are inﬂuencing us, and we don’t
know exactly how they are, but they are,”
Lamm said. “You don’t have to have some
incredible body, because you’re naturally
beauﬁﬁi .” . - .

_There are also risks in conveying that an
doll exempliﬁes the -“real” standard ofbeauty.

McDowell said marketing a doll that has '
typically “white” features may dangerously
normalize the appearance ofAmericanwom-

en of European descent, and thus alienate a '

number of other populations of class and race.

“If you’re a young girl of color, and you see
that your 19-year-old big sister doesn’t look-
like [the standard], and her nose isn’t shaped
like that  what kind of message does that
give you as a little girl?”_ she asked.

McDowell added thatprojects like Lamm’s ‘

can also productively start a dialogue about
how standards of beautybecome routine.

“It’s something that will get people talk-
ing about body image and parents talking to
their children who are interested in those
toys,” she said. I

For panelists, thebackﬁring of the Turkish

what Conte called “our cool but creepy fu-

I Though popular television shows por-
tray espionage as a cloak-and-dagger affair
of intrigue, Mularski said it is becoming
easier for states to steal information from
rival governments through malware, or ma-
licious software, which-refersto all harmful
or intrusive software. Borders and other
physical barriers don’t deter hackers in
different locations from coordinating their
efforts.

The groups that commitcrimes and es-

An argumentff

tive action, Obama issued a memorandum —
- directing Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez

' Thomas Helgean
Columnist

_ Unforttmately for Nigerian princes, there has

recently been a different type of chain email
circulatingthe nation’s AOL accounts: a mes-

A sage claiming that President Barack Obama

has, to date, signed “1000+” executive orders,
which far surpasses the number issued by
previous commanders  chief. '

Don’t start protestingtoo quickly, though

‘ —- itturns out, quite unsurprisinglya that this
, claim is blatantly false. Not only has the presi-

dent signed fewer than 200 executive orders,
but even the fabricated number pales incom-
parison to the 3,522 implemented by former
President Franklin D. Roosevelt. ‘

That being said, he has been busy asof late
closing the gap, with the most recent orders
focused on raising the minimum wage.

On Feb. 12 of this year, the president
signed an executive order raising the mini-
mum wage offered to federal contractors
to $10.10, set to come into effect in 2015.
Additionally, in a different form of execu-

..,..._..,-- ........_ _l.,. _ -..,.,----.—..._., .,...._...,.. 1. “.7...

to “propose revisions” to existing regulations
on overtime pay.
These efforts are all a part of the presi-

L dent’s push to prop up stagnant wages and

curb the country’s increasing inequality. The
centerpiece of this directive is a proposal to
raise the  wage to $10.10 across

the ‘nation. Unfortunately for Obama, this »

change must ‘come from Congress, which
is not well—l_<nown for its expediency or, of
late, willingness to work with the executive
branch.

However, once again, congressional inac-
tion in this circumstance will prove unwise,
as the beneﬁts of enacting such legislation
far outweigh the costs. ’

The Congressional -Budget Ofﬁce recently
released a report detailing the projectedef-
fects of increasing the minimum wage to
both $9.00 and $10.10 (in stages) by 2016,
at which point it would be adjusted annually
to compensate for inﬂation.

In short, the CBO found that the “$1o.10

....._.—.. ..-.~-_,.....,_.............,.., -.._ .... .. _.,.,.~__ -... ,,. ...,. .. H... ‘— -. —-..

option” would increase the earnings of 16.5
million people, leading to an increase of $5
billion in real income for those living be-
low the poverty line, whose ranks would be
reduced by 900,000. However,_the policy
would also lead to a loss of 500,000 jobs.
Additionally, the $9.00 option would have
similar but reduced effects.

The release of these results caused a stir in
Congress and the political sphere, in general,
with each side of the aisle taking something
different from the report. These commenta-
tors generally focus on the immediate costs
and beneﬁts of proposed legislation, as the
short-term impacts ﬁt the arguments tradi-
tionally made by each°camp. However, the
largest beneﬁt accrues from the long-term im-
pact of a minimum wage indexedto inﬂation.

But ﬁrst, we need a little Econ 101: Econo-
mists differentiate between what is called the
“nominal wage” and the “real wage.”

The nominal wage is the dollar value that a
worker is paid for an hour of work — $10.10
inthis case. The real wage is the nominal wage
divided by the price level of the economy;

or increased (national minimum wage

simply speaking, it represents how much
can be purchased with a certain wage. For
example, a nominal wage of $10 would cor-
respond to a higher real wage in an economy
inwhich aloafofbread costs $1 as opposed to
an-economy inwhich the same loaf costs $10.

Clearly, the real wage is a much better
indicator of what a worker is paid. Now if
the minimum wage is adjusted for inﬂation,
deﬁnedas the annual increase in prices, the
real wage will (theoretically) remain constant.
This will have two distinct positive impacts.

First, it will prevent the real erosion of
the minimum wage. In the past, while the
nominal minimum wage has remained con-
stant, the real wage has steadily decreased
as inﬂation ate away at the value of $7.25 per
hour. This will both improve the well-being
of those receiving the minimum wage and
curb inequality.

Second, this will prevent the adverse im-
pact on employment that results from sud-
den, large changes in the minimum wage,

such as that proposed by Obama. Returning
to Econ 101 for a moment, suppose that the

minimum wage is_ increased in line with a

general increase in prices. Employers may be
forced to pay their employees more, but they
will also have an increase in revenue, as the
price of their products will have increased,
and workers willbe able to afford them, as
their wages will have risen. _ V 5

Thus, each year will see a consistent real .-

. minimum wage with minimal variations in
V. employment. This stands in stark contrast

with the status quo in which the government

tially, resulting aloss of jobs from both a

. risingblackiliiie_and the economic shock from p
 _a sudden change in input prices.

. _ Now regardless of the long—term beneﬁts,

attention still must be paid to the short-term

impact of this policy.

I  The main question is whether or not the
increase in national income would justify the
loss of 500,000 jobs. Commentatorsfrom P

the left have responded by questioning the I

methodology of the study, claiming that if the
CBO had stayed more true to the literature,
the projected impact on employment would
have been lessened. 0‘ 

This may be the case, however,.it’s hard to

Somewhere along the nexus that links
stand—up comedy with coffee shop po-

— etry readings, you will ﬁnd the charming

and unexpected performances performed
at The Moth’s monthly Pittsburgh Sto-
rySLAMs. Originally founded in New York
City in 2007, The Moth is an organization
that promotes an artform as old as man-
kind itself: storytelling. The Moth’s Sto-
rySLAM in Pittsburgh —— which consists
of impromptu, off—the—cuff storytelling
sessions held in different cities across the
nation —- is held at the Rex Theater in
the South Side. Audiences members can
sign up to tell a ﬁve—minute story about
a preselected theme. Aside from the ﬁve-
minute rule, the only criteria for stories
is truthfulness.

The performance is more than just
storytelling — it’s also a competition. At
each installment, a collection of audience
members rate the performances and award
points to their favorites. At the end of the
night, a winner is crowned.

On Wednesday at 8 p.m., however, the

'I'i\m

organization’s best storytellers will be put-
ting their tales to the test at the Pittsburgh
GrandSLAM Championship at the New

' Hazlett Theater on Pittsburgh’s North Side.

The last 10 winners of the Pittsburgh Sto-
rySLAMs will face off against one another,

with the winner advancing to The Moth’s -

national storytelling competition in New
York City. This time, however, things won’t
be so off the cuff: They’ll be‘ receiving the
guidance-and "coaching of storytelling pro-
fessionals, such as Pittsburgh StorySLAM
producer Kelly Flanagan Dee.

At the most recent installment of Sto-
rySLAM, held on March 11, the theme was
“Heroes” — a topic that left a surprising
amount of room for interpretation. Almost
all the stories varied in tone and content,
and while some elicited laughs, others
were more serious.

One such performance was Tim Som-
mers, 48, who told a story about a boyhood
plot to seek revenge on his friend’s abusive
and alcoholic father. The plan was simple,
even comical — order pizzas and taxis for
his friend’s father from all over the city
until he couldn’t take it anymore. Though
it started out as funny, things took a turn

when they watched the boy’s father openly
weep. It was a moment that Sommers said
made him realize revenge was empty.

“You never know what you are going be
watching when you come to a Moth show,”
Dee said. She has been the producer for
Pittsburgh’s StorySLAMs since the New
York—based program ﬁrst expanded to
Pittsburgh in 2011 and is responsible for
helping to select the themes, working with
the venue and keeping in touch with the
ever—expanding community of storytellers.

“My responsibilities are basically mak-
ing sure that the show runs every month,”
Dee said. i

The variety of stories makes The Moth
appealing, Sommers said.

“The best moments are when the most
unexpected person comes up and tells the
most unexpected story,” he said. “There’s
nothing else like it.”

Sommers was in an accident three years
ago that left him bedridden and hospital-
ized for nearly a year. He said performing
at the StorySLAMs has been cathartic for
him.

“The ﬁrst thing I did at The Moth was
tell the story about my accident,” he said.

The,Moth’s GrandSLAM
V New Hazlett Theater

“I had never done anything like that be-
fore.”

Sommers said his adrenaline was
pumping after a room full of 300 people
laughed at one of his stories. He had never
previously been in front of an audience
that large.

Since people of all ages communicate
through storytelling on a daily basis, Dee
said this relatable interaction makes The
Moth appealing.

“We all tell stories,” she said. “We are
not often intentionally practicing the art
of storytelling, but it is still the way that
we connect to each other in communities
and in relationships.”

CONCERT REVIEW

 The War on Drugs gives
Altar Bar some rock ‘n’ roll

Jack Trainor
Staﬁ" Wrz’ter

While waiting concert-goers stood in line
outside the Altar Bar on Saturday, a man
stopped his car in the middle of the road and
asked the crowd who this band, The War on

Drugs, was and if they were any good. “Really - 5

good,” someone answered. “It’s rock ‘n"ro1l!”

Rising Philadelphia band The War on
_Drugs performed at the Altar Bar on Satur-
day. The four—piece band, which quietly re-
leased its debut album Wagonwheel Blues in
2008 , is perhaps the indie world’s best kept

l secret, but for how long? Earning a second

consecutive “Best New Music” badge from
Pitchfork Media for their third full-length
release, this year’s Lost In The Dream, the
band is set to attract attention in the near
future.

. Despite its name, which recalls the moral- .

ist paranoia of the Reagan administration,
The War on Drugs’ ﬂuid synth rock brings a
whole new feeling to those words. _For start-
ers, frontman Adam Granduciel -4 not to
be confused with friend and ex-band mate
Kurt Vile (who’s eerily similar" appearances
and approaches to music can sometimes
cause a mix—up) —— is a genuine rock star. On

Saturday evening, his long, wavy hair hung _

past his shoulders,.and he sported a denim
vest with ripped, faded jeans.

When Granduciel and company climbed
on stage following their excellent fellow
synth—rock band White Laces, Granduciel’s
drooping eyes and mild 5 o’clock shadow
buried beneath his mop of hair made him

appear at least ﬁve years older than his band .

mates. But that didn’t stop him from putting
on an electric and youthful show in front of
a lively crowd.

Feeding off his professional concentra-
tion, heand the other band members fol-
lowed the mellow opening song “Burning”
by jumping into a powerfully conﬁdent and
energetic performance of Lostln The Dream
standout single “Red Eyes.”

Crooning in his dusty Bob-Dylan—like
wheeze, Granduciel dug deep for every word,

immersing himself in the music. His eyes

remained shut or hidden behind a wave of
hair that bobbed with every drum beat as his

FILM

Bateman’s directorialsdebut pa

‘Bad Words’ just mediocre _

. ‘Dylan Abbott
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter '

“Bad Words” '
Directed. by: Jason Bateman

'Starring: Jason Bateman,‘
Kathryn Hahn, Rohan Chand
Grade: C -

When did comedy stop being funny?
It seems as though cinema has been
spewing out agonizingly formulaic and

unoriginal comedic movies for as long‘

as time itself.,Case in point: Jason Bate-
man’s directorial debut, “Bad Words,”
which epitomizes the apathy and tedium
that has co'me to define this disconcert-
ingly predictable genre of ﬁlm.

Guy Trilby (Jason Bateman, trying
his damnedest to shake off that aver-
age—_]oe, nice—guy typecast) is a foul-
mouthed, middle—aged misanthrope
who enters a national spelling bee for
children by exploiting a dubious loop-

hole, ostensiblyjust to piss offthe par-'

ents of these hard—working kids. But
when he meets Chaitanya'Ch_opra (Ro-
han Chand), an overly innocent 16-year
old competitor whose only friend is his
spelling binder, Guy begins to show his

‘softer side, and we realize he isn’t all

that bad, after all.
' On paper (and also in the mislead-
ingly promising Red Band trailer), this

‘movie could have been a gold mine of

hilarity. Themes that involve pushy
parents, midlife crises and educational
systems are overlooked to make room

‘for a catalogue of desperately unfunny

quips on race, weight and puberty. All of
these crude remarks are dribbled from
the lips of Guy, who isn’t given enough

« depth to be likeable, nor is he quite

despicable enough to be entertaining.
He’s just rather pathetic.

Onceiwe discover. the reasons he
is such a 'grumpy,_obnoxio'us cynic -
which is basically the most unoriginal
narrative ploy used to render straight,

white men sympathetic 4 it only con- i

firms that he’s not as edgy and myste-
rious as he, and the movie in general,
thinks he is. . _ .
Unfortunately, the surrounding
characters do little to ameliorate this
central flaw and are completely two-
dimensional. Jenny (Kathryn Hahn,
providing so_rneAquirk but no charisma)

plays a journalist documenting Guy’s’

story, proverbially jabbing to ‘get some
‘interesting information, but she is sim-
ply a means of sucking out some half-
hearted moralism from Guy. Moreover,

- the awkwardly included sexual interac-
tions between the two, during which’

Jenny demands Guy not look at her,
feel shoehorned infor the sake of more
comic vulgarity.

Despite this, Guy’s sickly sweet coun-
terpart and part-time ally Chaitanya
manages to show us the unpracticed

fatherly side of Guy. It’s a momentarily —

intriguing relationship, ‘as.Guy guides
him through a 101 course in debauchery,
sin and breasts, but it doesn’t mate-
rialize into the heartfelt friendship it
initially promises. That said, their re-

‘lationship does provide some engaging

and chuckle-worthy scenes within a ﬁlm
that,for the most part’, is uninteresting
and unfunny. ‘ ‘ ._ ‘

Bateman’s direction is overwhelm-
ingly fine. He does everything to the
book, as is expected from a first-time
actor—turned-director. Though when he
does try a little experimentation with
ill-ﬁtting uses of slow-motion, it reeks
of inexperience. But we’ll let him off,
being such a nice guy and all‘.

Finally, for a ﬁlm that was carried,
albeit quite laboriously, by the conceit
of its central character being a black-
hearted, unsympathetic jerk, it’s com-
pletely undermined by the conventional
and lackluster ﬁnal moments. The ﬁlm’s

-attempt at an uplifting endingis forced,

transparent and woefully predictable.

The most annoying thing about “Bad ,

Words” is that it isn’t even bad. It’s just
depressingly mediocre. I

But what makes a great Moth story‘?
“The ones that get the best reactions
seem to mix comedy and seriousness,”
said Matt McPar1and, who graduated

from Pitt in December of last year and
is a fan of The Moth. He described the

perfectlstory as being_both “light and '

heavy.” A p .
- Humor is_an essential_element ofthe
StorySLAMs. But that isn’t the only way

<lFROMPAGE6.  

DRUGS  

‘ knees buckled and grooved. Often, he would

let out awild yelp or whoop before staggering

‘ back away from the microphone to unleash
a minute-long guitar jam. ' _ ',

The’ show’s lengthy set list of ab out 15

songs was mostly from Lost In The Dream, ’

with extra liberties taken for guitar solos and
extended synth openers, so when the encore
rolled around, it felt morelike a midway in-
termission. -. « '

‘ Even when audience members started

- teetering back and forth on their sore feet, -

Granduciel showed no signs of wear. Before
the encore, he looked back at his drummer
Patrick Berkery, who was standing up and
stretching. I -

' “What, you guys tired or something?” he »

joked. “C’mon!” V ‘ .
Suddenly, Granduciel appeared 10 years
younger than he was a half hour ago.
~ While The War on Drugs is certainly on
its way to stardom, it’s not there yet. In an
attempt to set up lesser known song “Comin’
Through” as part of the encore, Granduciel
asked the audience something inaudible
except for_“comin’ through?” The audience
responded with a confused hush. '
“Just say yes,” he mumbled as he began

_the shimmering strums to open the song, i

which elicited the cheers and slow head bobs

. Granduciel was searching for.

Despite that minor blunder, audience
members shouted song names to the rock-

ers throughout the set. One of them, “Black.

Waterfalls,” the send—off track to 2911’s Slave
Ambient, was granted as the concluding song
of the night. As the last chord faded out,
Granduciel ended the show as he did every
song, with a quick, cheerful “thank you” and
an added wave, promising to return soon.

to utilize the Moth arena.'iAs Dee said-,

moving and honest stories are always '

harder to perform because you have to
be more vulnerable. ‘

“But a good meaningful story can also
be funny,” she added.

Though The Moth holds different per-
formances allover the country, including
the local StorySLAMs and a touring show
called The Moth Mainstage, but both
Sommers and Dee think the enthusiasm

in Pittsburgh exceeds that of other cities.
' Sommers, who has attended Sto- _‘

rySLAMs in Chicago, Los-Angeles and

San Francisco, said Pittsburgh “is deﬁ— -

nitely the most well—attended Moth.” ‘

“3oo people [line] up around the
block to go see people that they don’t
know tell stories,” Dee said, describing
the immense popularity the program

has garnered since The Moth first ex—¥
panded to Pittsburgh. Unlike bigger cit— ‘
ies, Pittsburgh has far more viewers than _

performers, Dee added.
«But that doesn’t mean the perfor-
mances are lacking in storytellers..-

~

“We have seen a community of regular
storytellers come back over and over
again. to refine their craft,” Dee said.

Though some come to the show with
storytelling or performing experience,
some, like Sommers, are simply looking
to take a risk andconnect with their
fellow Pittsburghers through an ancient

medium.

“After I got out of the hospital, it took

. me another eight months to walk again.

 The Moth was kindof me getting back

' into the world,” Sommers said. I

MEN’S [BASKETBALL

Transfers find va

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff I/Vriter

The Pitt men’s basketball program was rather
fortunate to have received its 11th invitation to l

the NCAA Tournament in its past 12 seasons‘
last Sunday. -

And no, head coachjamie Dixon’s lacklus-
ter nonconference schedule isn’t the reason.

The Panthers’ struggle for a marquee win
is not to blame, either.

Rather, Pitt and its fans are fortunate in a
different context: Dixon’s inability to retain
players in recent years could have set the pro-
gram into a depressed state, but the transfers
miraculously placed a near-reverse effecton
the program. -

Six of Dixon’s 11 commits from the 2009
through 2011 recruiting classes transferred
away from Pitt — a whopping 55 percent
— which exceeds the 34.3 percent national
transfer rate for college basketball players.

Additionally, Trey Zeigler, who joined
the team in 2012, transferred last May, and
Steven Adams, Pitt’s highest-touted recruit
in decades, was selected 12th overall in last
year’s NBA Draft.

Some of the former Panthers left because '

they desired more playing time. Others left
because they felt Oakland wasn’t the right ﬁt.

Regardless, they’re now glimpses in high-
light reels of Pitt basketball’s recent past, and
their regular seasons at their new homes just
ended.

Some shined, and others sat more than
they played. Their seasons are highlighted be-
low, with commentary on their performances
by beat writers that follow the teams.

Trey Zeigler (Senior: TCU; committed to
Pitt in 2012 aftertransferringfrom Central
Michigan)

Stat line: The NCAA did not grant Zeiglera
waiver to play immediately upon transferring
from Pitt, so the 6-foot-5 slashing guard sat
out the 2013-2014 season.

The scoop: “The Frogs and the fans have
temperate expectations for Zeigler. TCU is in

2 the position where a winning culture simply

isn’t in place right now  Zeigler is currently
listed as a guard on TCU’s roster, but [coach

   

 

  SPORTS

Trent] Johnson won’t hesitate to move him
around. Due to the large amount of injuries
the team experienced this year, Jarvis Ray, a
senior, played at the four all year despite being
listed as a guard. I think Zeigler could ﬁt into
Ray’s role nicely,” according to Jordan Ray,
sports editor at TCU 360.

Johnjohnson (junior guard: Penn State;
committed to Pitt in 2011)

f -,
Bobby Mizia |Visual Editor

Stat line:Johnson came off the bench for
the Nittany Lions, scoring7.1 points per game
in20.7 minutes. Known as a sharpshooter
at Pitt, Johnson hit 32.3 percent of hisshots
from beyond the arc this season and scored
40 points in his ﬁrst three games back after
sitting out due to NCAA transfer. rules. He
played wingahd some point guard, butplaying

Thorpe were playing better. 1 _
The scoop: “His role will probably remain
at the two in the foreseeable future — more
of a- guy who comes in and is able to shoot
the ball.  He’s going to get more minutes
next-year. [Point guard Tim] Frazier is leav-
ing, and that is going to open some doors in
the backcourt forjohnson. He’s going to get
an opportunity. If he can come in and shoot,

he’s going to be able to play for Penn State,” it

according to Stephen Pianovich, sports editor

' at The Daily Collegian.
MalcolmGilbert(Redshirtsophomore: '

Fairﬁeld; committed to Pitt in 2011)

Stat line: Gilbert averagedjust2.5 points in
10.2 minutes per contest in which the 6-foot-
11 center pulled down 2.7 rebounds. Gilbert

. left PittinDecember2012 becausehisbrother,

Marcus, received a scholarship offer from
Fairﬁeld, and Malcolm wished to play with
his brother. Marcus, a forward, was second
on the teaminscoring (13.9 points per game)
this past season. . -

The scoop: “There were just other guys
ahead ofhim.  There were two guys who are
pretty dominant already who [coach Sydney]

Johnson had stuck with, and Gilbertwas sup-

posed to be getting adjusted to the system.  V

When [Marcus] did get offered, it was really
a golden opportunity because they had the
ability to create so much more team chemistry
because they had played together in younger
years, and I thinkwe’re really, going to see that
come into fruition next year,” Pat Kiernan,
sports editor at The Fairﬁeld Mirror, said.
Khem Birch (junior: UNLV; committed
to Pitt in 2011)
Stat line: Birch’s defensive play has gar-
nered attention from NBA scouts. He was
named Defensive Player of the Year for the
second consecutive season in the Mountain
West Conference, and he earned Second-
Team All-Mountain-West honors, averaging
a double—double in points (11.5) and rebounds
(10.2) per game, whileﬁnishingthe 2013-2014
season second inthe counuy in blocked shots
per game (3.76).
Birch started all ofhis 10 games as afresh-

rying success at different Pf0g|’am$

man at Pitt. He was criticized aska Panther for

his lack of interior size and because he hit the l

ﬂoor often. .
The scoop: “I don’t think that soft label
applies.  Khem has probably been theb_est'

player that UNLV’s had, not justthis year, but- i

you could make the case that last year, he was
the better player [between he and forward
Anthony Bennett, who became the No. 1 pick
in the 2013 NBA Draft]. The way he impacts
the game defensively is unlike any other player
in the Mountain West: He is a true force and
he is instant in offense at UNIM  If he were
to go in the draft, I’d say he’d be a late ﬁrst-
round, early second-round pick, but I don’t
think we’ll be seeing him leaving UNLV,” ac-
cording to Danny Webster, sports editor at
The Rebel Yell.

_]._]. Moore (Senior: Rutgers; committed

. to Pitt in 2010)

Stat line: After being granted a hardship
waiver to play immediately by the NCAA in
the summer, Moorescored 11.2 points and
2.9 rebounds in 26.6 minutes per contest. He

also shot30 percent from 3-point range. The -
6-foot-6 forward did not receive any confer-

ence accolades. «

The scoop: “He played the three, the four
when needed, and a little bit of the two when
