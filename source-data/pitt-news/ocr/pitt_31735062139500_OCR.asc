‘Submit Religion
To Truth Test,’

Delegates Told

Dr. Clausen, Miller Seek New
Interpretation Of Religion
In Modern World

Conference Closes

By Ruth Belle Strothers

“Doubt us, rebuke us, question
us, scorn us, but in God’s name,
don ’t let us sleep,” was the tense
appeal that Dr. Bernard C. Clau-
sen ﬂung a.t delegates to the U111-
versity Y conference on the
church and social change which
closed yesterday afternoon.

“W'e must submit Christianity to the
test of truth,” Dr. Clausen stated,
when he accused the church of being
asleep. The church, he further
charged, must assume the blame for
shabbiness in human life; he cha.rao-
terized the nation as “witless blunder-
ers,” ‘and claimed‘ that, “Pride.ful_

prestige is the verything whichhas"

damned our country.” _ 
Francis P. Miller, who presented to

the delegates hisconception of ; the

distinctive contribution given by a

Christian world ‘view, cla.ssiﬁed. com-‘
and‘.

.m.unis1n, ._ifa'.-iscisni, capitalism,

Christianity as the main faiths in the

modern world. _ - ‘ . .- .- . ,-
The essence of the -Christian faith,

as setvforth by Mr.~Miller, is that,

.“I believe in God the father

from whom every family, nation, race.

and class derives its name and. na-

ture." . 

, Capitalism—“Self" As Messiah

X Capitalism and communism_ _ are

identical in the belief that man is._.an

economic , being, he slated; }Co_I_n_mu-

__nism has merely collectivized the3eco-

nomic man., In other words,‘ as Mr.
Zlliller pointed out, the capitalistic doc-
trine is “the self” as a. messiah; the
communistic doctrine-_is' “the class”
as, the messiah.  , ' 3 "

Italianfascism, with the nation as
the ultimate object, Miller said, is a
sociological idea of “God; and German
nazism, in which b1ood——“just prick
_»-our-se1r"—-is th_e~- nitimniéf ‘end,"**pre
seats a biological concept of God,

That all world views seek to ﬁnd a
“way out;” was Mr. Miller's conten-
lion. -Capitglisni» believes its ends al-
ready achieved, and communism can-
not succeed unless the subsistence
level becomes the same over, the en--
tire world. _“Blood_1.will ﬁght blood;
we're not all Nordics,” the speaker
laughingly declared. ‘

T0 533' that “I believe in God from
whom every race, nation,’ and class
derives its nature,”. is laughable and
antiquated, “but,” he emphasized,
“forces that deny that reality will
disappear." .

"Quick Remedies Dangerous”

_’When asked if the Christian world
view was immediate enough, the
speaker suggested that, “Quick reme-
dies are sometime dangerous. Chris-
tianity has made civilizations before
and it will make them again; it is
one of the greatest social forces the
world has ever known.

“There are no short circuits in his-
l03‘.‘v'. God would be a fake if he let
the human race get away with the
mess we have made without paying
llle DI'iC8- Society has sown the seeds
and must reap the harvest,” declared
Miller. ,

“I don’t care if civilization does
Cl‘l1Sh.” the speaker retorted to a
\'l_l1esti_oner, “our. industrial civiliza-
,'-1011 JOUY well deserves to crash.”
‘The only world,” he concluded, “is
the world of God.” . ' --

On Saturday the delegates discussed

,S0(:ia-1 projects of the,R00seve1t ad-

ministration, and ‘challenged the stand
of the church and social change. Yes-
iefflfiy. they considered the possible
political effectiveness ‘of Christian
:-students. and in the closing confer-
ence session heard Dr. Walter Horton
present a sermon on “Realistic reli-
31011 for this generation.”

Wants ‘Deﬁnite
Foreign Policy’

“The time has come for the present.
administration to choose a deﬁnite
foreign policy," said Francis P. Mil-
ler-,_ ﬁeld secretary of the Foregn
Policy’ Association, in an address
Friday before the jointly-sponsored
1 M—\VHA noon luncheon forum group.

According to Mr. Miller, the demo.
1-ratio powers should cease their “aim-
less wandering in foreign affairs.” He
decried too the “enlightened self-in
terest” which the Hoover administra-
tion followed to promote the interests
of each American group.

MI‘. Miller contends that so far
there has been no constructive atti-
tude
except in South America.
the state department note of July 1933
which “torpcdoeil” the VVorld Eco-
Jnomic conference in London and
caused the "delegates to get home as
quietly and as inconspicuously as
possible.”

in connection with the note, Mr.
Miller accused Raymond l\-Ioley, for-
mer Undersecretary of State and
“brain truster," of “littleness of mind”
and “general insigniﬂcance.”

“Considered as a whole,” the speak-
er continued, “the mostsomber pic-
ture created through the administra-
tion's foreign policy can be found in
the Far East. On the other hand, the
mood of South American nations has
changed from suspicion and hate to
at least mutual conﬁdence.”

-Miller Scoffs At Possibility
  Of TrueAmer,ican Isolation
ll/n.iteid' States Advised To-Join League, To Conquer
.0 ' Depression From Foreign Trade’ Angle
A 4 By Roman Lapica

_ Speaking before the Y forum Friday, Francis P. Miller, Yale lecturer and
secretaryof, the.Foreign Policy Association, laughed at the idea that America

“I myself like to leave the country occasionally,” Mr. Miller declared.

His argument, however, centered around the statement that “so‘dynami,'o

States might be conquered by the de-

.-pression or -might exist without -in¢-

creasing intercourse with other na-
tions." _  ' 

Mr. Miller—~throwing out facts to
.,-prove every, point——reviewed Roose-
velt’s “lackadaisical” foreign policy,
his gradual isolation and the- present
set11p.in which Europe plays the least
important part. ..

He dwelt on isolation and anti-
isolation, continually digressed from
the subject to throw illuminating com-
ments on international problems and
ended with the statement that the
United States should join the League
and attempt to conquer the depression
from the foreign trade angle.

“We have spent billions,” Mr. Miller
asserted, “yet there has been little
if any lessening in unemployment ﬁg-
ures. Might it not be advisable to
change our method of attack and ﬁght
through this. crisis with the aid of
other countries?” .

’-Mr. Miller cracked down on “Dem-
agogue”- Long, citing his as an ex-
ample of what a man could- do with
a worried, stricken people; termed
American negotiators as the .most
pathetic beings he had ever seen, and
threw in the statement that he did
not believe man was an “economic
animal” but rather a “super-economic
being.”

In an interview,
clared: ‘ - , ._

“'v’ould I like to see the dep-ression
crush us, bring on a destructive world
conflict and lead to total annihilation
of civilization? Cer’ta_inl_w,’r_ not. I’m
not a paciﬁst. Neither do I love
serenity. But ‘I believe there is some-
thing more to life than struggle for
existence.’_’ . . ..

Mr. Miller saw “nothing: at‘all”' in
lecturing to college students.

“College students,” he “exclaimed,
“are on the whole the non-working
class. Speaking to them’ isproﬁtless
from a social‘ point of view. Thus I do
very little lecturing. ;

“It is the truck drivers, the dish-
washers, the people who --have to earn
their living who sooner or later are
going to build or destroy this world.”

Reading Lists

 

If you" wanted to study every

course in the University it
would take about 100 years.
Few of us do that. Indeed,

most of us specialize in narrow
ﬁelds, and ﬁnd ourselves, after
ﬁnishing school, with only frag-
mentary knowledge of many
vital spheres of knowledge.

Realizing this probability,
The Pitt News begins VVednes-
day a regular feature consisting
of  short list of important
books in one particular ﬁeld of
study——books which will give
students not specializing in that
subject a grasp of the funda-
mentals.

We suggest you clip the regu-
lar lists and ﬁle them for refer-
ence.

norc Bi-Weekly
 Called Pitt Salvo

Sophomore Wins Name Contest;
Colonel Cullen Selects Motto _.

Pitt Salvo, suggested _by Frank
Ralph, E37, was judged the winning
title in the contest to select an offi-
cial name for the bi-weekly publication
of the ROT-C cadets. The ﬁrst eight-
page issue under the new name ap-
peared Friday. .

A winning motto: "Honor, Duty,

Loyalty,” was suggested by Lieuten-
ant-Colonel Edward J. Cullen in an
article in the inaugural issue address
of the paper. ‘
. Complete with general news arti-
cles, features, editorials, aud sports
items, the Pitt Salvo promised to have
“the center of burst right on the tar-
get” with succeeding issues.

In a featured article, coed cadet
captains demanded military assign-
ments consonant with their rank.

Maxine Christensen, C35, captain of
the First Battalion, said, “I would be
honored to be given some military or-
der or to have to live up to some mil-
itary laws. ‘I’m in the army now,’ and
I would like to receive duties worthy
of a captain.” , _

Mary Smith, C35. captain of Battery
A, asserted, “I think that the coed
sponsors should come to know each
other and their sponsors better. The
Military Ballis no place to get ac-
quainted." _

Margaret Doescher, C35, captain of
the Second Battalion, also stated:
“There is very little we can do, but I‘
feel that we can at least attend drill.
There should be a few duties for us
to perform to balance the grand honor
which wéhave received; ‘I might add
that the capes and caps are far too
good-looking to be hung away in the
cupboard.”

Among the other features are arti-
cles on “Soldiers and babes." “The
one-arm chair,” and “Your corps and
my corps.”

neering fraters.

orchestra, favorite dance group on
campus, will play from 2:30 to 5:30
o’clock on Wednesday afternoon in

Jack Hammerschmidt, C35, chairman
of the SFA dance committee, stated.

The price of admission is 25 cents
plus registration card or personal
recognition.

been removed and after archi-
tectural detalls are finally de-
cided upon. According to John
Weber, business manager of
the University, excavating will
begin in three weeks.

The ceremony was directed
by the members of the Tuesday
Musical club, who six years ago

Fraternity Heads
Vote To Organize
Into New Council

CPSF Names Committee To Draft
Constitution; Shortens Second
Semester Rushing Period

‘Conﬁdence,’ Is Claimed

After shortening rushing season
for the second semester from the
usual six days for that period to
a concentrated four—day session,
the Council of Presidents of So-
cial F1-ateriiities started action to
replace itself by a new Interfra-
terni'r.y -Council Thursday evening,

Upon passage of a motion to un-
dertake the change, James Wills, C35,
Sigma. Alpha Epsilon, was named
chairman of a committee to draw up
a. constitution and set of by-laws for
a new I-F Council, by Leslie Wilkins,
C35, Delta Tau Delta, CPSF chair-
man.

Immediately after his appointment,
Wills moved that the constitution used
by old Interfraternity Council, before
University recognition was withdrawn
from that group, be adopted for the
new council. - 

Wills’ Motion Defeated,

On the vote, the motion drew only
two assenting ballots and “fills was
instructed to have hiscommittee be-
gin to function. After new regulations
are proposed, they must be sub-
mitted to the.ofﬂce of the dean of
men and to the fraternity advisory
committee for approval, before the
new council can be organized.

The defeat of Wills’ motion was
the high point of the meeting. His
fraternity had served a writ of man-
damus immediately before on Clifton
McClain, C35, Sigma Chi, and George
Golanty, BA35, Sigma Alpha Mu, ‘de-
manding that a meeting be called of
the old Interfraternity Council for the
purpose of officially dissolving. Mc-
Clain ‘and Golanty were president and
secretary of I-F Council when that
organization last met in the spring.

Behind the SAE action, was the at-
tempt to obtain the return of the $50
bond posted by each fraternity when
it entered InterfraternityCouncil.

Conﬁdence in CPSF Shown

Interpretation by the executive com-
mittee of the defeat of Wills’. motion
was that the membership had ex-
pressed a vote of conﬁdence in the
C-PSF organization and its sincerity
in sponsoring adoption of a new coun-
ci1—one which will be unmarked, they
hope. by the political strife which
caused the outlawing of the old coun-
cil by the University. Under the old
constitution and by-laws, it was as-
serted, an abundance of loopholes ex-
isted for manipulations by political
divisions. All members present -voiced
a.. disinclination to witness any rep-
etition of the experiences of last
spring when the group split into two
rival factions over elections and made
any harmony in the Council impos-
sible. . ., .

The groaning mantle of the Delta
Tau Delta house has been burdened
with another cup, as Wilkins was pre-
sented the championship trophy in
the interfraternity touch football
tournament. Wills took home the sec-
ond place cup to the SAE’s.

The remainder of the regular
monthly meeting, held at the Phi
Delta '1‘heta house, was concerned
with the athletic program for the
coming few months, as given by
Golanty, athletic chairman, and with
a discussion of the CPSF's Interfra-
ternity ball Friday night, led by its
chairman, Melvin Carnahan, BA35,
Phi Delta Theta. Edward Durkin, C36,
Kﬂllllii Siisfllla, gave a report on the
annual pledge banquet Wednesday, of
which he was chairman. A report
was made by McClain, social chair-
man, on the Interfraternity informal,
sponsored last month by the group.
Henry George, E35, Pi Kappa Alpha,
indicated that a report embodying sug-
gested changes in rushing procedure
would be brought before the meeting
next month.

Memorials And Books
LTHOUGH THE SOUTH LAVVN of the Cathe-
dral is to lie fallow for three weeks following
yesterday ’s ground-breakiiig, the ceremony in
which sod was turned for the Stephen Foster M_c-
morial building marks the start of construction In
earnest. Withiii three weeks, according to Uni-
versity authorities, excavating ‘work will coni-
mence aiid building will follow without delay.

It is encouraging to see the building program re-
sume, aud students who have grown accustomed
to the noise of riveters and hainniers, during the
last two or three years of sporadic Work on_the Ca-
1;hed1~a.1, will not be disturbed by the audible by-
products. The Memorial will have a useful part in
the University program, and it will carry on a dis-
tinguished buildiiig plan, towards giving the Uni-
versity a distinctive place among urban universi-
ties. Foremost of all in the minds of those who
conceived it, moreover, was doubtless the encour-
agement the Memorial is to give Pittsburgh stu-
dents to pursue their individual talents.

Witli the virtual accoinplislinient of the Stephen
Foster Memorial idea, students will be anxious to
see the University program extended in other di-
rections. The anem._ic.Un_iversity library, for one
thing, deserves an injection of new books. The
expansion of both undergraduate and graduate
study depends upon the expansion of the entirely
inadequate State hall library. _

VVe would like to see it happen in our day.

Do Activities Lower Grades?

A VERY POPULAR COLLEGE EDITORIAL
seems to be one of the latest from the hard-
thinking, up-and-coming Daily Illini._ At leastit
has been reprinted‘ half a- dozen times. The sub-
ject is the popular question, ‘whether pa.rticipatio.n
in student activities tends to lower scholastic
standing. - _ -
, The,Daily. Illini is happy to ﬁnd that it does not.
Arguing that .its_own.staﬁ' has a 3.75- scholastic
=average—-about a B avera.ge———Thc Illini ﬁnds that:
“Activity people must be above the average -
student in intelligence, or they could not hold
responsible positions. Freshmen entering ac-
tivities soon ﬁnd that good grades are neces-
sary -for advancement and consequently those
making poor grades gradually drop oﬂi. -
,. “In regard to the use of time, the activity
i man utilizes every spare moment while the stu-
dent not occupied with outside work often,
spends his leisure time unproﬁtably.”
TheNews is willing to argue that its own staﬁ

 

factory scholastic work is not very different from
the ability to do satisfactory work in activities.
But The Illini seems to have forgotten its “con-
trols.‘;” Who can say, but that, without the coni-

of the staﬁ might ﬁnd themselves with a 4.9 aver-

good book and a Phi Beta Kappa key.

 

From The Saar

HEN THIS PAPER went to press, the results
of the voting in the Saar were still unknown.
Early Sunday, some of the most bitter nationalistic
feelings in Europe were drawn to a thin line of
tension in an area about the size of Allegheny
county. It was freely predicted that the imme-

hung _on the plebiscite and the “incidents” which
may or may not attend it. -

While German Foreign Minister Von Neurath
announced that the Reich will make no eﬁortto
take Alsace to itself again, and wliilehe .spoke_
with diplomatic warmth of Germany’s friendly
“agreements”. with Poland on the question of the
Corridor, he avoided a direct statement of his
count.ry’s interest in the Saar. It is well enough
to talk about Poland and Alsace when your coiin-
trymen are thinking of something else.

From the Saar, then, comes this morning’s big-
gest newspaper story. Will the expected Euro-
pean conﬁagration break out over the plebiscite of
a few thousand industrial workers? Or will Eu-
rope continue awhile in an existence that depends
for its security upon the tempera.teness of indus-
trial magnates in France and Germany? When

Nritiongliﬁtic Trends New pp

,DangeriiIin A Modern   Movies.

H By iﬁaymond’ Pcarlman

HERE HAS BEEN recently a good deal "of discus-'

_ slon about the inﬂuencing effects of the movies in.
shaping and molding our ideas and prejudices. .This is

to a great extent unfortunately true. I do not doubt that
many people’s knowledge about Henry VIII has been.

secured from the recent picture about his private’ life.”

It is also true that the majority of _less fortunates ‘_d_'e"rive

their conception about the ‘modus vivendi of’ the rich’ byi?

occasionally seeing a lavish. Hollywood ,pi'od,uctio‘ii,'of
the palaces, the habits, the extravagances of the wealthy.

Andithep reverse of this is by no means false; the
movies are 5. means by which many millionaires obtain
a vague conception of the poverty and wretclfiedniess of
the other half. ‘Not for a moment’ do I disparage the
semi-educational value of Hollywood productions, but I
do believe, and this -is what I oppose, is the antagonizing
inﬂuence which the movies provoke among our different
nationalities. ’

I have in mind at this writing Paul" lvIuni’s recent pic-
ture, “Bord_ertown.”‘ This picture, like the “House of
Rothschild,” will tend to promote a disiiitegrated na-

tional life. It is the old‘ story of race '.pr‘ejudice. A Mex- §

ican attempts to break into the stratum of the American
“four hundred." He, of course, fails, and the inevitable
remark, “I am going back to where I belong,” creeps into
his feelings. Throughout the entire picture this feeling
of contrariety, instead of unity among peoples, dominates
one’s thoughts.

Perhaps many willthink that I am reading too much '3

into this picture. Perhaps I am. And no doubt the aver-
age theater-goer will dismiss this column with complete
indiﬁereuce. To be sure, he will say,-the movie for most
of us has only one purpose and that purpose is pur.e‘on-
tei'ta'ininent. But there is another side to the story. ’-Let
us attempt to put ourselves in the position of American
Mexicans. ‘ r ‘

Any Mexican who sees that picture is bound to turn
away. from it with a repugnant" feeling for everything
that is out of his case. It will tendgto arouse in him .3.
patriotic feeling toward his own class. It will stimulate
that intense and so distasteful nationa.listi'c feeling which
in the past and especially today is the cause for many of
our political and economic disorders. ' ' i‘ x "

“Bordertown” represents the. reactionary move-
iment in the movies. Ultra-imperialistic tendencies
have effected an era of internationalism rather than
of petty nationalism. No one, moreover, denies the
fact that ‘the seeds of international as well as na-
tional combinations are sprouting today. Whether
these "seeds will ‘mature in paciﬁstic tendencies or
whether a series of the most devastating and gigantic
wars between the great monopolistic countries will
ensue, it is difficult to predict. ‘ '

However, one thing is certain: Hollywood should
be prevented from producing pictures-—even though
it be unconscious of what it is promulgating-—which
tend to aggravate the nationalistic sentiments inter
nationes. . i -

I would be more prone to advocate a campaign against
the nationalistic sentiments of “Bordertown” and “The
House of Rothschild” than to ﬁght against obscenity in
the movies. ' " '

Banks Finds Similar [Word

Forces In .Huysmans,

, Lewis Novels

By Edwin P. Banks

F “*0 BOOKS I H YE read receii'tl_v preach a moral, each in a extremely
The first is Huysiiians’ “Against the Grain" and the other
Sidney Howard’s stage version of Lewis’ “Dodswortli.”

The French decadent certainly did not intend to express any moral prin-
..ciple in his novel. Quite on the coiitrary, Huysnians attempted to ﬂaunt the
most abject cynicism in relating the desperate adventures of one Des
.}.jISSie11Le-S in the ﬁne art of escaping ennui.

The author is “immoral” as only

with a self-conscioiisly beautiful style
the iiauseating perversions of his
hero. Bu‘, there is a. moral implicit in
“Against the Grain,” and it is one of
tlie oldest morals since man ﬁrst de-
veloped that troublesome introspective
faculty which the religious call con-
science and the modern psychologists
call something else.

iLet me review the novel in a few

'phrases to indicate what I mean. Des

Essientes is a young man who has
brains, education, money and no poor
relations. At thirty or so, he is con-
vinced that he has sucked the mar-
row of life dry; he has eaten, drunk
and been merry in every way he pos-
sibly could to
senses. He has become disgusted with
the’, world, has retreated into‘ an ex-
pensive hermitage and now experi-
ments_ with all sorts of fantastic lux-
uries to keep himself amused. With
all the resources at his command, he
is still bored, still awfully fed up.
And the novel, ends in the same de-
pressing tone although it seems to
intimate that the hero may reenter
the Catholic church for consolation.
Eg=o~Vs. Life ~ . -~ .

"What Huysmans does not explicitly
point out is the fact that Des Essi-
entes ‘was all -his life completelfy
wrapped up -in himself. Apparently he
never felt the slightest twinge of at-
'-fection for anyone except himself, and
apparently iio_ one else ever cared a
bit about him.jAI'1d the moral,'I think,
is this: you cannotcxpect to enjoy
eg:ist.ence for long if you expect to
enjoy it.by yourself -alone-

-It- is a paradox with the normal

, li_u_ii.1aii,l_)eing_, that you “can begin to
= lie‘CODteI1ti‘OI1ly"‘Tiii‘l19l’l you- look be-

yoiid--yourself. Your chief -concern is
with attaining your own happiness;
yet you can hardly find it unless you
concern yourself also with the hop-
piness‘ of iotlier people. “ . ‘
Prose Of-Living . . .
u.-‘,‘Dodsworth” preaches the identical
n-i-oral. Sinclair Lewis was undoubt-
edly aware that he was moijalizing,
and he made no effort to conceal‘ the
fat-.t‘." His hero, Dodswortli, is a more
intelligent__- less- rat.ionalizing- type of
Babbit, who turns out_to be “almost
dainiied -in ' a ‘fair wife.” - The‘ wife,
Fran, is fair, slim and close enough

to forty to desire seriously to be
taken for thirty. She is another
Madame Bovary, detesting what she
considers the prose of her niarried
life, yearning to give what she cou-
siders to be her beautiful soul the
freedom it deserves. Fran persuades
her husband to retire from his pros-
perous automobile business, to travel
with her through Europe, to prove
that life reall_v begins at forty.
While poor Dodswortli, half bewil-
dered but still B.(lO1'lllg‘ her, drinks and
smokes and pokes around towers and
cathedrals, his wife spends his money

‘seeking to revive her youth and to

learn the ways of sopliisticated wo-
man. An Englishman, whose uncle is
a. general, an international Jew, who
is supposed to be errand boy to gov-
ernments, and a‘ bankrupt Austrian
nobleman, all quite willingly heighten
her impression that she really is a
romantic personality. Meanwhile
Dodsworth stumbles along, sadly
aware of his wife’s iiiﬁdelities, but
still interested in her happiness be-
fore his own. -

Selﬁsh Life, Futile

The ending ‘of the play is conven-
tional, yct it is realistic. Fra.n’s dreams
of youth and romance dissolve about
the same time that Dodswortli re-.
alizes her selﬁshness and the impos-
sibility of their ever being happy to-
gether again. Conveniently, there is
a divorced Mrs. Cortwright to satisfy
his affectionate nature. As for Fran,
she is done.

This review of the story has been

tedious, but it does serve to reveal
Lew.is’_ moral, ,._that , selﬁshness . and
happiness are*not compatible. “ ‘
_ Modern sophisticates are inclined
to pooh-pooli writers who inoralize.
Such activity is supposed to be un-
literary, puritanical, old-fashioned. I
dislike moralizing myself when it is
crudely and obtrusively presented in
fiction. It should be remembered, how-
ever, that: one of the important prob-
lems in living is still the problem of
human ‘conduct. A writer who is
treating of reality as he thinks he.
seesjit can. hardly fail. to. emphasize
the ni.or«a1.element_ in it. l’ll take a
Shakespeare, a. Tolstoy and a George
Eliot any‘ day. befor'ef’any ii'ie‘niber of

_ Murder Case

Editor, The Pitt News:

VA grievous crime was committed
some time before 1 p. in_ in the office
of The_ Pitt News on Friday. I need
not 'conii_iieiit on the high character
of" the two deceased. -Words are in-,
sufficient to describe the general
grief at their loss. But we must not
allow ourselves to be blinded by our
sorrow. Something must be done. It
is essential that proper attention be
given to the nature of this crime so
that other lives may not be lost Such
action as that committed on Friday
must cease and cease promptly!

May I review the circumstances
attendant to" the crime? The two in-
'dividuals so unhappily brought to an
"pntiniely end‘ ‘were pursuing their
‘nori_i_ial‘activities in The News office
when the murderer, who "must have
been a good friend, since there was
‘no outcry, entered and in the most
‘dastardly fashion committed the aw-
ful deed. The -bodies were already
stiff, when discovered about noon, Fri-
day.

‘ Now, in consideratioii of the grav-

- llty of the crime, in consideration of

its heinous nature, in consideration
ﬁofthe high cliaracter and sincerity of
the souls of the slain, theret'oi'e it is
ﬁtting, indeed it is imperative, that
such action" as may be deemed neces-
sary be taken by the University As-
sembly andby Druids, the two guard-
ians of the honor of our institution.
The janitor, who neglected to wash
the windows of The Pitt News office
and thereby made possible the veil
ing of the crime in darkness, should

be censured, although I forsee ob-

  Letters From Readers

aforementioned friends

jections from those who are friends
of the janitor. But if there is no
mention made of why the janitor

was censured, it will be possible not "

only to keep the news from the out-
sideworld but also to placate the
of said jan-
itor. . i

The guilty man" should be found
and should be dismissed (and if this
action be too difficult for the Univer-
sity Assembly, I believe we might
relegate it to Druids). Yes," he should
be "dismissed, if only for incompe-
tence-—if such a step is deemed nec-
essary to withhold from the outside
world the true nature of the dreadful
scandal. for in fact the guilty man
has a dreadful crime upon his soul,
particularly since the dastardly deed
was committed by that most awful
and lethal of weapons, viz, an ice
pick. Something must be done!‘

I do not wish to close on a note of
vengeance, so I shall comment once
more on the high character of the
dear deceased. Alas! They were the
most excellent goldﬁsh that ever
graced the office of The Pitt News.

Lefliargic Joys

By Wilbur D. Clark
T IS lNl£VI’I‘ABLE_. I suppose, that
all those who have beoii zicciisoil

haps ilicre is some basis for the

The inciuszrioiis are the most in-
tolerant critics of those intelligent
economists who believe that eiiergy is
the thing which ought most to be
narefiilly conserved since it is rare.
The letliargist is treated with little
tenderness; one would think that the
wholly natural desire of iiiaii to do
as little as possible is a sport of dis-
ease. And the lethgarist is of the
ﬁrm conviction that this mad, rush-
ing, blind desire called ambition is a
plague.

'l‘o get back to the grasping of quo-
tations which to the lethargist, at.
least, seem to justify his manner of
living: The other day I ran across
the following in Charles T. Cong-
(lon’s “Reininiscences of a Journal-
istz”

‘‘I know nothing like the ﬁne
genius which writ'es no books,
challenges no observation, cares
not a farthing for fame, but still
goes on dreaming much and do-
ing nothing, taking down the
folios and putting them back in

a listless way, and while cele-
brity is within its grasp not
deigning to grasp it. The ver-

dict of the world is “laziness,"'
but the world knows nothing of
that other verdict which fancy
or imagination, which delicate
taste or delightful thought, pass-
es upon itself.” '

A discussion ‘in English class on
novelists of the “one novel" type,
those who write one volume which
attains some recognition and then are
never able to repeat the perform-
ance, suggests that perhaps there
are some “one column” columnist
whose one good column was written
a long, long time ago and was prob-
ably never published. Do I perceive
a nod of agreement in the audience?
But. yes, a veritable wave of nod-
ding. ’ A

To Go East Again

ill Clash With Fordham Rams
At Madison Square Garden
On Wednesday Night

 

Feature Double-Header

By William K. Trosen

Dr. Carlson and his Pullman-
wcary group of basketball players
pulled into Pittsburgli yesterday
from their initial Eastern jatint
just long enough to change sliirts
be1'ore'preparing to entrain to-
morrow night for their second At-
lantic seaboard trip. The prowling
Panthers will invade New York City
for their game with the Fordh-am
Rams Vlfednesday night at Madison
Square Garden. The game will be
played at the Garden as one-half of a
feature double-header attraction, the
other game being a tilt between the
undefeated New York university quin-
tet and the strong cc-nl'e1'en('e rivals
of the Panthers, the Temple Owls.

This season Fordham has earned
the distinction, if it can be called a
distinction. Of bein?-' 3“ 9Xi1'€II1€13’
hard—luck cage team. In four starts
the Rams have broken even in the
number of ga.mes chalked up on each
side of the Won—lost ledger. In the
two games that the Rams have lost,
the margin of victory in each game
has been but one point. Yale man-
aged to nose out the Fordham team,
23-22, while the other one-point 
ifeat was administered by the Rams
city rivals, Columbia. The Lions
scored in the last ten seconds to win,
30-29. Fordham has defeated Seventh
Regiment and Loyola, bOth DY lie’
cisive scores. _

Cavanagh Experaments

Coach Vinnie Cavanagh still has the
Ram varsity in an experimental stage,
searching for a steady winning com-
bination that will improve his present
varsity. Cavanagh has a real DI‘0l3'
lem, due to the fact that he possesses
two teams of approximately 60118-1
strength. Thus far the Eordhamcoach
has used a varsity made up of last
year’s veterans and reserves. At the
forwards are Creighton Drury, a soph-
omore star, and Johnny Fritzche, a
last season reserve. Drury, in the
game with Seventh Regiment, gar-
nered sixteen points and in all other

games has been a. standout at ‘his

forward post. Young holds-__,down the
center position, and. at the guards are
Captain DePhillips and O’Connor._ De-
Phillips is a 1934 letterman and in-
dividual high scorer on the Ram ﬁve
this season.  - ' ‘ ..

For the Golden Panthers, Dr. .Ca1_‘l,—.
son will send the same ﬁve players
that have started every previous game
this year in an attempt to add the
Fordham quintet to their rapidly grow-
ing list of victims. Skippy Hughes
and Claire Cribbs, co-captains and in-
dividual high-point. men on the squad,
will take to the Garden ﬂoor as the
Panther’s starting forwards. Pete
Noon, towering center of the Pitt
team, will again start at the jumping
position, while at the guard posts
Ross Emrick, sophomore star, and Ted
Roderick will round out the starting
ﬁve. .

The Panthers will be seeking their
sixth victory in eight starts in the
clash with the Rams, thus far this
season making two Mid.-westerntrips
and two Eastern jaunts, meeting some
of the country’s leading teams.

Double Bills Popular ‘

Games _at the spacious Madison

Sqtiare Garden arena have been re-

\' ..-1.

cently made more attractive to the.

basketball enthusiasts of the Metro-
politan area by the novel idea of bill-
ing two big games instead of one.
The Panther-Ram and the NYU-'l‘em-
ple battles enter the books as the
third in a series of six attractive
double-headers. In the two previous
attractions a crowd of 16,000 attended
each affair, showing that. the cage
game is mounting rapidly in the mat-
ter of cash customers. A new wooden
floor has been built in at the Garden
especially for the series of twin bas-
ketball games. Also something new

in bank boards has been installed, the i

new “boards” being made entirely of
glass so as not to obstruct the view
of the spectators.

City Title Won Last Year .

 

 

Basketball will soon pop up for the
Greeks. The Interfraternity basket-
ball tournament, high light of Greek

athletic activity, will again be the
only yearly fraternity event to ter-
minate in an inter-city championship.

Pitt’s Delta Tau Delta. city ~ cham-

role in the opening match on February
12.

All the contests are scheduled for
the Trees gymnasium court. Last
year’s rules will apply, with two ex-
ceptions. First, instead of Mr. Dam-
bach appointing students for ofﬁciat-
ing, these men will be named by the
petition form, used recently by the
newly-organized Intra-Mural commit-
tee. All men interested in the try-
outs are requested to sign up at the
Dean of Men’s office.

Also, a physical exam has beeni
added to the ..list of qualiﬁcations for
a player's eligibility. Drs. Carlson or
Kowallis at the Falk Clinic must give
an OK to all players before the first
game.

George Golanty, chairman of the
Athletic committee, announces that
eligibility lists with complete instruc-
tions will soon be distributed among
the thirteen social frats. These lists
must be returned by February 7 to
the Dean of Men’s ofﬁce.

Two leagues will then be formed
from the accepted entries. The win-
nersin each league will meet for the
Pitt title, and the runners—up will com-
pete for the third-place cup.

Then the Pitt champ takes on the
Tech winner for the city title.

MAT MATTERS

By Lloyd Conley

In which are presented a few tips
about the varsity wrestlers.

Evans should be the best 118-
pounder in the district this year un-
less he begins slipping due to in-
J11_I‘leS. ,

Bedillion is one of the best men
on the squad. He is the AMA champ
and 135 pounds of TNT.

Detzel is at present the king of

the heavyweights but will be pressed
hard by men who are, more willing to
work.
, Rector is coming through fast.
Heavy, fast and well—adapted to the
mat, he should prove to Detzel that
work is essential if you want to
wrestle for Pitt.

Willets is the doctor of the squad
and looks like the best bet for the?
105-pound division. Willets is fast and
has had experience. Above all he is
a willing worker.

George should be the man to rep-
resent the 155-pound class. He has ex-
perience, knowledge of the game and
a ﬁghting heart that will be hard for
an opponent to wear down.

Cover is now conﬁned with a bad
cold, but he should be a serious threat
to the 135-pound division when he fully
rec-oveis. He is the present holder of i
the junior AMA title. .

Babcock l0Ol-TS like the best threat.
for the 125-pound class at present..
B‘~‘“3ie “'35 .§§ood as a freshman and=
has lots and lots of what it takes.

Conle_v—he's the one who writes this
stuff; so . , ,

Pace 99 Quickens In Fraternity Loops
As Leading Pin Teams Meet In Alleys

 

Important scraps‘._for leadership ‘in
both “A” and “B” leagues are slated
this week as the Interfrater-nity bowl-
ing tourney nears a. climax. '

In League “A,” Phi Gamma Delta
will attempt to mar the "perfect rec-
ord of a favorite Phi Delt ﬁve Wed-
nesday‘ evening at 7 -o’clock. Both
teams have compiled ‘enviable records
thus far. Phi Gamma Delta has lost
but. one game, suffered in the open-
ing,match against Kappa Sigma. 

, However, after that match_. the Kap-
pa.» Sigs withdrew. from competition.
Thus. ‘in ?case this one game. means
anything in the ﬁnal outcome, it can-
not be counted against the Phi Gams
since the. Kappa Sigs forfeited their
matches by dropping out of the tour-
ney after the ﬁrst da.y of play.

Thursday, last year’s runner—up Phi
Kappa Alpha combine will face stiff
competition in Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Both teams have lost but one League
"B” game. SAE, however, still must
whip the Phi Kap pinmen, last ye.-ar’s
champions, before having a chance to

outpoint the PiKA rollers at the pay- -

off.

Tomorrowonly two matches are
scheduled in Leaf-zue “A.” ‘Lambda Chi
Alpha willattempt to stop the Fiji
bowlers in the ﬁrst session. Phi Ep-
silon Pi and Pi Lambda Phi tangle in
the concluding match of the evening.

_"ijAII-Streamlined Train
Cited As Impractical

“A perfectly streamlined front end
one steam locomotive,” stated L. E.
Endsley, consulting ..engineer and
‘lecturer, addressing the University
ASME seminar last Thursday, “is ab-
solutely impractical, since a great deal
of air must’ necessarily be blown
through the locomotive in order to

keep the boiler temperature high
’enough“~ to produce superheated
steam.”

 Mr. Endsley traced the develop-
Etnents itrlocomotive history since the
beginning of the 20th century, point-
.-ing out the improvements in power
and efficiency which the steam en-
