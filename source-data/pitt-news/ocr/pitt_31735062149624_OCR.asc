Pittsburghers Prefer Waughisp
Seascape in lnternationalshow

By Alice Benovitz

No one can quite decide if it is
just the average Pittsburgher thwart-
ed love of the sea or his innate dis-
like for breaking precedents, but for
the ﬁfth consecutive year Frederic
Waugh received the poular Interna-
tional prize. There seems to be
something about a lonesome looking
rock caressed by watery waves that
simply intrigues the laymen.

Like Tarkington. Waugh has hit
upon a popular selling formula, and
for years he has been turning out
these same seascapes. His average
output reaches ﬁfty or sixty canvas-
es a year which comes fairly close to
the assembly line method of produc-
tion. His agents have little or no
difficulty disposing of his work: are
only too anxious to have him con-
tinue painting waves.

Art critics admit his professional

craftsmanship. but ﬁnd little feelingi

or love of the sea in his work. One
invariably senses a certain superﬁ-
cialness, a certain common pretti-
ness.

A

g Probably the endless succession of
} waves and rocks made his son, Coul-
[ton Waugh, turn to go to the oppo-
isite extreme in his ﬁrst serious art
‘show. Son Coulton’s technique con-
{sists of painting burlesque queens
gand East Side toughs in bold, stri-
ident colors. While his garish brush
 strokes received some favorable com-
3 ment. critics found a great deal lack-
iing in his draughtmanship.
; may be the hangover from his work
{as a comic strip creator. ,
 According to Mr. Philip Elliott, as-
'sistant professor of Fine.Arts, the
,public made a surprisingly good
ichoice in awarding third prize to the
ihuge ﬁnely detailed painting of All-.
Ebright. This artist combines meticul-
ious detail with real artistic talent.
5 It bears some resemblace to Manteg-
, na’s St. Sebastian in the Louvre.
Going back to Frederick Waugh,
the only hope for a change in next
year’s popular prize is that Pitts-
burghers will suddenly get violently
- seasick.

safety drive sponsored by the
Parking and Traiﬁc Committee of
SFA. Under the direction_of Ed-
win Ellis, C39, chairman, the com-

mittee has ‘distributed bumper 1

wiches and bottled drinks in the
eighth ﬂoor Tuck Shop have been
stamped with safety cartoons.

Ellis urged students to publicize
the campus drive and use the Bet-
ter Trafﬁc committee bumper
posters until the end of the cam-
paign, December 16.

Any students who park their
cars on Fifth avenue‘ or Forbes
street, in the restricted zones ad-
jacent to the Cathedral for more
than two consecutive hours, are
warned that police have been in-
structed to enforce the regula-

Debating   Squad .
Stumps Ohiorl  
On ‘Alliancei

After making a debate tour which
took them over 600 miles through the
state of Ohio, three members of
Men’s Debating Association arrived
back on campus Monday morning.

Accompanied by Roy H. Umble,
lecturer in speech and director of
the men’s debate unit; Saul Dizen-
feld, C39, Edward Springer, C39, and
Abe Wolovitz, C40, returned from a
series of intercollegiate discussions
with Kent State university on the
proposed Anglo-American alliance
question.

All debates on the tour were con-
ducted in the Oregon style and were
held before high school and audi-
ences whose debaters are working
on the proposition which is the na-
tional high school topic for the year.

At Freedom high school on Thurs-
day morning, Springer delivered the
aﬁirmative constructive speech with
Dizenfeld cross-examining the nega-
tive Siedschlag from Kent.

At Massilon high school before an
audience totaling over 1,500, Wolo-
vitz delivered the constructive
speech. Springer did the question-
ing. High light of the tour, accord-
ing to Mr. Umble, was the discus-
sion held at East high in Youngs-
town, Ohio, Friday evening when
representatives from four high
schools listened to Dizenfeld point
out the tremendous economic power
that would be secured by an alliance
with Great Britain.

Meeting of Quill Club
Scheduled for Tonight

Quill Club, honorary literary fra-
ternity, will meet tonight-in 1201 Ca-
thedral. The meeting will begin at
8:15 o’clock, according to‘ Robert
Brown, C39, president.

Plans will be made for the club’s
participation in the annual Schol-
ar’s Day Assembly. Several works
in short story form will be read by
club members. Refreshments will be
served.

Dr. Putnam F. Jones, associate pro-
fessor of English, is faculty adviser

°llnive1'sit.,v (‘l11b.

He said that
there was no objcctioii to any
aluiniii, Varsity Letter C1111), or
outside interested parties giving tui-
tion aid to athletes.

The Chancellor’s statement seem-
ed to reinforce belief that the fresh-
man tuition problem would be satis-
factorily adjusted.

‘Temporary Alleviation’

Following on the heels of Univer-
sity business manager John Weber's
conference with the freshmen at
4:30 -o’clock in'132 Cathedral, this
pronouncement by the head of the
University has apparently ‘served as

' a temporary alleviation of the prob-

lem. .
_ Weber’s statement said in part,
“We believe that with co—operation
and a fair exchange of work done
for the compensation you will receive
through the student employment
service, most of the difficulties which
you anticipate will not materialize.”
While Weber’s statement, couched
in vagueness, had left the freshmen
in a rather indeﬁnite state, the
Chancellor’s after-banquet statement
has given them some reassurance.
Speeches at the banquet did noth-
ing to clarify the muddled state of
the athletic controversy. And, pre-
vious to the Chancellor’s late state-
ment, opinion was that the “ball was
still on the 50-yard line.’’
Sutherland Speaks
Most pertinent remarks were
made by Dr. John. B. Sutherland,
varsity football coach. “I hope that
I will never see a Pitt team take the
ﬁeld not equipped physically,” he
said. “We should have at least a
50-50 chance to win. We can’t win
every game, but as long as I am
coaching, we will try to win. Other-
wise we’ll have to give it up. I hope
it never gets to be a wishy-washy
thing where no one cares to win. In
that case it should be aba-ndoned.”
Chancellor Bowman, appearing
late because of a previous engage-
ment, began in a blustering manner
and said that he felt like “speaking
straight from the shoulder.” How-
ever, he decided that it was best
to stick to his notes.
The text of his speech contained
the following statements:
Bowman ‘VVants Football’
“You want good football. So do I.
You want Dr. Sutherland. So do I.
I want here a great University with
strong football in it; a team that
plays hard to win and in the world
of sportsmanship is above criticism.”
“The real question tonight is: Are
we to do our part along with lead-
ing colleges and universities in the
East and the West to have intercol-
legiate football as a wholesome
sport -for students and for the public

Social Growth

Of Mexico at Inquiry Meeting

An understanding of .Mexico’s In-'

dian population, its system of land
ownership, and the early develop-
ment of the social revolution is
necessary before attempting to de-
scribe current social change there.
Such is the opinion of Ruth Barthol-
omew Camblon, instructor in the
School of Applied Social Sciences.

Leading last Monday’s Inquiry
Forum discussion on “Current
Changes in Mexican Life,” Mrs. Cam-
blon gave a geographic description of
the country. emphasizing its contrasts
in languages, dialects, social organi-
zation, and climate.

She revealed that 25 percent of
Mexico’s 16,500,000 population is
irnrlc up of Indians, 70 per cent a
mixture of Indian and white, and the
remaining 5 per cent from a pure
white stock. “About six-sevenths of
these people live in the central part
of Mexico, the middle plateau where
a moderate temperature exists,” she
added.

Mrs. Camblon’s explanation for the
failure of the government to carry
out its educational program lies in

the multiplicity of languages in Mex-
ico. Thirteen separate tongues are
in use accompanied by 53 dialects.
“The government doesn’t know what
language to print text books in. Al-
though Spanish is the prevalent lan-
guage, it is not very inclusive.”

Another problem facing Mexicans,
according to Mrs. Camblon, is that
there is no water supply outside large
cities. Only six per cent of the land
is under cultivation, in her estimate.

Describing the social reform of the
government, she declared’, “lt’s ﬁrst
point was an agrarian reform of giv-
ing more land to the peasants. The
labor reform raised wages of the
working class. Nationalization of
natural resources was marked by in-
ternational complications.”

Mrs. Camblon maintains that from
the natural resources standpoint,
Mexico is in a “semi-colonial” state
because most of them are controlled
by foreign investments. The trouble
sets in because the 1911 constitution
of Mexico states that all land and
resources belong to the nation and
people as a whole. ——R. A.

Students Find Common Ground

In Support of Ludlow Bill

LOOKING over the committee for the war _referendum
petition drive, we noticed that all variations of stu-
dent opinion are represented, ranging from the alleged
conservatives to alleged radicals.

This is one issue on which all sincere advocates of
peace can ﬁnd a common meeting ground; it transcends
political ideologies.

The amendment to the United States constitution
(backed by Representative Ludlow) provides that,.except
in the invasion of the continental United States or its pos-
sessions, Congress shall not declare war tuitil a vote of the
people has been held.

It will not remove the fundamental causes of War—
it is not a panacea. It will only act as a check on a strong
and blustering foreign policy. And it Wlll give the people
a chance to indicate whether or not they want to be killed.

Too often we have been led into war by one man, or
the loud clamor of a minority. The propaganda ha.s then
been spread, to bolster up the people ’s supposed enthu-
siasm.

Advocates of “adequate defense” should favor this
amendment, for it renders less expensive and less difficult
the preparations for a wa.r abroad.

Paciﬁsts can support this bill because they at least
agree with “defense of our soil” men in refusing to ﬁght
a foreign war. The only ones who should object are those
who want Americans to protect private investments
abroad by means of the threat, and probably the use, of
force.

That is why we camiot understand the conspicuous
absence of ROTC members from the committee.

SFA Joins Council Drive

To Decrease Traffic Fatalities

IT’S A RELIEF to get away from all the bickering and
inisuiiderstandiiig which has eliaracterized the current
athletic situation and turn a little attention to something
closer to the normal area of student activities. A

One of our stories today informs us that SFA’s safety
campaign, featuring poster, booklets, sandwich stickers
and all, is progressing under the direction of the Parking
and Traffic committee.

Aside from the aiitic.ipated inconvenience of biting
into sa.fety stickers every time we attack a Tuck shop
sandwich, we think the drive is a peed idea and should be
supported by the student body.

Previous campaigns have demonstrated that by con-
stantly keeping the problem of safety and danger on the
highways before the eyes of the public, accidents can be
cut down considerably. This psychological approach
(coupled with a little more direct eiiforcenient) used by
the Pennsylvania Goveriior’s Safety Council, has resulted
in a considerable decrease in traﬂic fatalities during the
past year.

VVe wish Bud Ellis, of cheer block fame, and his com-
inittee success in a worthwhile project, and hope the cani-
pus will take their advice and respond to the slogan, “Be
happy—Gro safely.”

We Canvass Our Public
In Re: Athletic Subsidization
FOR the past couple of weeks, we’ve been blowing off

steam about football, the Code Bowman, “de-em-
phasis” and all the other components of the contemporary
athletic muddle at the University.

Although we have been making every effort to gauge
student opinion on the subject,'we realize that the ordin-
ary “man oii the campus” has had little opportunity to
have his say.

As a result, we went into a huddle with our Campus
Canvasser, and decided to make a little survey among the
student body. Printed elsewhere on this page are the
results.

This “Canvass” makes no pretense of scientiﬁcally
measuring student reaction. It only picks students at
random throughout the University and tries to get all
shades of student opinion.

Because of the limited scope of the survey, we are
hesitant to make any editorial coimnent. The answers,
however, we consider an interesting reﬂection of campus

opinion.

L ATEST reports from Washingtoii indicate that a group
of senators and representatives ha.ve been invited bv

Florida “sugar-daddies” to take part in another bowl

game—this one to be known as the “Grapefruit Bowl.”

When the junketeers dig in, we’re afraid that it will be

the old, old story of the public getting the squirt in the eye.

THE PITT NEWS

The Editor’s Diary

We listened in on the radio Sunday afternoon and

' somehow managed to endure a full hour’s ranting by the

eminent Father Coughlin of “social justice” fame.

Our first impression was that maybe New York’s
WMCA and several other radio stations were right in
refusing to carry any more of the broadcasts emanating
from Royal Oak, Michigan. For what we heard sound-
ed like . .

A Demagogue Speaking . . .

digging into the graveyards of the past and resorting to
many doubtful facts to get across a message that dan-
gerously approached the anti-semitic. But after think-
ing it over, we decided that maybe it wasn’t good policy x
to suppress such broadcasts.

In principle, a Democratic country is supposed to
allow all shades of opinion, from the Communist to the
Fascist, from the so-called “Radical” to the ultra-re-
actionary. After a full and fair audition of all sides,
according to the theory, the citizens will repudiate the
“un-Democratic” theories and make a rational and judi-
cious choice.

Of course things don’t always work out that way.
The mass of people can often be swayed by false doc-
trines presented by the right man at the right time in
the rightway. But if we don’t practice a well-rounded
policy of . . .

Freedom of Expression . . .

and start singling out some individuals or elements,
however unpopular and unf-democratic their programs
may be, we are in effect adopting the practices of re-
pression of troublesome groups adopted so effectively by
totalitarian regimes.

Most logical reasoning on the subject, We think, was
presented by Socialist Norman Thomas (himself con-
sidered a “dangerous” man by seine) from the stage of
radio’s Town Meeting of the Air a couple of weeks
back. The keen—witted Mr. Thomas argued that sup-
pressing the rights of minority groups sets a bad pre-
cedent, instills in the people a mob spirit of intolerance
which in time might be employed against the very peo-
ple who employed such tactics in the ﬁrst place.

By this time, our trend of thought was set, and we
couldn’t help going on to the next thing troubling us, the
problem of censorship of the press and particularly . . .

Censorship of College Publications -. . .

The question was brought to our mind by the now
Well-known quotation from Dean Spencer of the Syra-
cuse School of Journalism, which we clipped from the
New York Times in one of our spare moments, and
which now appears on this page under our masthead.

College journalists are continually reminded of their
relative inexperience in this ruthless world. “You’ll
soon learn,” _they say, “that there’s little freedom of ex-
pression out in the world and that you’ll have to keep
your mouth shut if -you want to get along.”

And then we, appealing to our practical side (for we
really do have one) agree that it’s a tough world we’re
going to be thrown out into one of these sunshiny June
days. We realize that economic and social and political
restrictions often tie one down and make one only a.
mouthpiece or a “bread and butter” man . . yet,
think we . . . I

That’s All the More Reason . . .

our institutions of higher learning should permit stu-
dent journalists freedom of expression in discussing both
campus and outside affairs. ‘  '

We can, then, excuse a mercenary world for im-
posing restrictions for the beneﬁt of the controlling few.
But on what grounds can we excuse a college or uni-
versity, a place to which one naturally looks for all
these high—sounding virtues, for suppressing the free
intelligent expression of its students.

What if we do have to step into a restrictive world?
We may as well enjoy a little freedom while we can,
and the universities may just as well set an example
for the outside world, and avoid doing its part in the
training of hypocrites.

American Assistance To Japan
Protested

According to the recently organized American Com-
mittee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression,
161 members of the faculty of Mount Holyoke college
have signed a petition addressed to Secretary Cordell
Hull.

“We the undersigned members of the faculty of
Mount Holyoke college,” it says, “wish to express our
profound regret that American airplanes, metals,
chemicals, motors and munitions have so largely made
possible the terrible aggression by Japan in China.
May we beg you to use all possible measures to bring
to a close this Iﬁtrticipation in the war of an aggressor
nation insofar as we are in reality accessories after
the fact?”

The American Committee for Non-Participation. in
Japanese Aggression is sponsored by such outstanding
citizens as Dr. A. Lawrence Lowell, Dr. Robert E. Speer,
Hon. William E. Dodd, Dr. Mary E. Woolley, Professor
R. A. Milliken, Miss Helen Keller, Rockwell Kent, Rabbi
Stephen S. Wise and others.

“Today we can view the futureiwith a serenity and

THE BIG APPLE POLISH
Dr. U. G. Dubach, Oregon State college’s dean of men:
“Anyone who isn’t wise enough to do intelligent

This is a subject which I know
very little about for as I said to
Legion, “I know little about this
athletic de-emphasis business, Le-
gion. At Pitt everything is pure.
there is no conflict, everybody loves
everybody else, and we have had
an SFA committee investigation
that solved all of our problems.
Besides there is a rumor out that
we are going to have a weekly ap-
ple roll in the commons room, an
old English custom, you know.”

“I am very sorry to hear that you

are in ignorance of the situation, but
I am glad to hear that everything is
going so well at Pitt,” replied Le-

gion.

“Oh yes, everything is ﬁne since
the SFA investigation. But tell me,
Legion, what is this de-emphasis
business?”

“Well there are those who believe

that the whole thing was started by

the Communists, but it seems that it
really started some years back after
the Carnegie Foundation’s famous
snoop through the intercollegiate ath-

letic closets.

The work of that com-

mittee of scholarly, snoopers revealed
the dastardly conditions of the col-
legiate athletic front and immediately

the heads of the different colleges,

who, of course, had been in total ig-
norance of the situation, demanded a

thorough clean-up.”
Ever sznce this famous investi-
gation, according to Legion, the
various academic heads have been
crossing over into the ranks of
purity. They say that if the stu-
dents will follow them they will
_ lead them out of the valley of sub-
sidization, hypocrisy, and guile into
the land of milk-white purity-

“How do we get purity, and how
long will it be before we are led into

the light, Legion?” I asked.

“That isn’t deﬁnite. .It’s a matter
of time until all the football players

-are abiding by the codes under.

which they will play for the sheer
sport of the game instead of a
‘monthly stipend.”

According to Legion many col-
leges in the east and in the middle
west have established purity codes
and yet they have continued to have
winning football teams which is due
entirely to the amateur spirit and
will to win encouraged by the ath-

letic codes.

There are some who cast

insinuations at the integrity of these
schools, but in the words of Senator
Ziskind, “they are subversive groups

to which we should pay no heed.”

“As I understand it, Legion,” I
‘interrupted, “the whole situation is
analagous to the man who cuts off
one leg and says, ‘Now I can lick
anybody with two legs because my
purity will aid me.’

“To me it seems to be an attempt
upon the part of the colleges to sell
the public a second-rate grade of

football at ﬁrst-rate prices.

“Nor does -the de-emphasis part
go very far,” I continued as Legion,
who is a friend of Saffron, lifted
my watch, “for the university

ants, and publicity men are to be

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7. 1938

Campus Canvass
By Sammy Rosenberg

QUESTION:

Do you favor Ll policy of open subsidization of college
athletics or do you advocate a less emphatic program
on this pliam of extra curricular activities‘?

ANSWERS:
Chas. Kepple. BA42.

“I think the boys should be subsidized because any-
one who spends his time for the school should get some-
thing out of it. The majority of football players carry
lifetime “battle scars” with them and although they
can’t be compensated for these injuries they should at.
least. be given their education.”

Bob Saﬁ‘ron, C39.

“The University is an educational institution: it has
no responsibility to provide Roman circuses for the city
of Pittsburgh. Let the super fans watch pro games
which are better played.

Pitt’s scholastic reputation has suffered as the result
of its terriﬁc teams. It is known all over the country as
a “football college.” If it must rebuild its educational
function at the expense of the team it will at least be
giving athletics back to the students.”

John Sawyer, L39.

“I favor a policy of “partial” subsidization. This
policy at least should include full tuition and school
supplies. On the other hand there should be a require-
ment of a maintenance of a “good standing” scholastical-
1y.”

John McRorie, BA39.

“I believe that colleges should have a modified plan
of subsidization in their athletic programs. I ﬁrmly
think that all athletes should at least get tuition and
books free. After all, the athletic teams of an institu-
tion are among its chief assets. This is not only true as
regards the university but the city it represents as well.
Dorothy Bradley, E1139.

“I do not favor a policy of subsidization of college
athletics because it places our athletes on a professional
basis; it places the small colleges at a disadvantage be-
cause they can’t afford the high subsidization which will
occur in large universities; and thirdly, what are our
colleges ofr . . education or athletics?”

Ben Kline, M41.

“I’d just as soon see athletics subsidized. All schools
do it whether they say so or not. The boys work for
their education and deserve what they get.”

Florence Gillespie, C39, and Dorothy Mulvihill, BA42.

“We favor a policy of emphatic subsidization of col-
lege athletics. The students are proud of the Univer-
sity’s athletic standing and without it the University’s
standards will drop both athletically and educationally.”
Jean Hahn, C42.

“I think if there is to be great emphasis of college
sports the players should be provided for in some re-
spect; I don’t think too great emphasis should be placed
on college athletics. I’d prefer a school with high scho-
lastic rating school to one of high athletic rating but a
well rounded combination of both would be most de-
sirab1e.”

Dorothy Struble, Ed39.

“As it is today good athletic teams and subsidization
go hand in hand. If less emphasis on college athletics
result in inferior teams I favor an open policy of sub-

. sidization.”

Arch E. Barnett, Jr., BA39.

“I believe that a wide and open subsidization policy
is advisable. Can anyone believe that other schools have
not and do not use subsidization? Subsidized athletics
helped build up the enrollment of our school; why stop
now (do we want to give Tech all the glory)?

dramatic show-down.

The build-up had been ideal.

The time was ripe for some

Maybe that is why most everyone didn’t know exactly what to
think when the time came to push back the ‘tables and head for the
A

check-room.

About the only thing of any real
tangibility that came out of the
formidable line-up of speakers was
that everyone was agreed that Dr.
Jock Sutherland was not only one of
the ﬁnest gentlemen that the Univer-
sity has ever matriculated, but also
that he was one of Pitt’s greatest
teachers and that everyone wanted
him to stay, “peaceful and content-
ed,” at his alma mater for the rest
of his days.

It was furthermore, forcefully re-
iterated, that Dr. Sutherland was
f'ootball’s leading coach. All of these
things have already been expressed
by the student body, by the alumni,
by the people of Western Pennsyl-
vania, and by the recognized sports
authorities. To hear them again was
still alright.

With what Dr. Bowman said, there
will also be no student squabble. He
declared that the question of the
evening was, “Are we going to do our
part along with leading colleges and
universities to have

students and for the public interested
in sportsmanship?”
The answer to this question of the

moment is no great problem in
repartee. It is simply and positively,
“Yes, Pitt is.”

Dr. Bowman really answered this
rhetoric himself, He supplemented
the remarks of everyone else in say-
ing that Dr. Sutherland is a “gen-
tleman.”

The answer is that with Dr. Suth-
erland supplying the guidance, Pitt
will, as it has done in the past, lead
the way in the wholesomeness of its
conduct and the high plane of its
sportsmanship.

Now where are we?

About Dr. Sutherland, he conclud-

stuff. Second, I am sure that he is
a great teacher. Third, I am sure
that he is a gentleman, and more
than anyone else, maintains the
athletic department on that level.”

Characterizing the speeches of all
of the other speakers was commenda-
