Criticism of BLOCK plan continues

By Kathleen Scanlon

t Senior Staff Writer

At the end of last semester,

freshman Joy McElhinny
sometimes bought food she
didn’t even want.
‘ She, like other Pitt stu-
dents, was racing to shed
meal plan blocks as the end
of the semester neared.
Blocks do not transfer from
one semester to the next, so
to students, any remaining
blocks meant wasted money.

McElhinny said she
thought, “I’m paying for
this,” so she even bought
food for others. “I didn’t
want to lose the money.”

The fact that blocks do not
transfer into the next semes-
ter is just one complaint Pitt
students have about the
BLOCK plan, implemented

Students soy
environment
geting worse

By Anthony Breznican
For The Pitt News

» College students believe the
environment is only getting
worse according to a survey
conducted at the 1994 College
Fest in Boston.

The computerized survey of
772 students, conducted by
Veryfine Products, Inc.,
revealed that 62 percent of the
students surveyed‘ believe the
condition of the environment
is worse than it was five years
ago.

The survey also said more
students are making personal
efforts to improve the envi-
ronment.

Eighty-two percent of those
surveyed said they try to recy-
cle on campus, and 70 percent

by Pitt’s Department of Food
Services last September.
Director of Food Services
Betsy Sallade-‘Farina conced-
ed that the plan still needs
some ironing out, but said
overall the BLOCK plan far
exceeds old meal plans in
terms of choice and flexibili-
ty.
“This is an experimental
meal plan,” she said. “It still
has some kinks in it, but
we’re going to try and work it
out.”

In response to student com-
plaints about the BLOCK
plan, the Pitt Student
Government Board sent a let-
ter to university officials out-
lining the aspects of the plan
that students say should
change. According to SGB
president-elect Julie Crowell,
Food Services should try

harder to educate students
about how to use the BLOCK
plan wisely.

Among student concerns is
the requirement that first year
on—campus students buy the
250/280 BLOCK plan at
$800 to $900 per term, and if
they don’t use up all the
blocks, they can’t get their
money back. .

“I think the rule for fresh-
men is ridiculous,”
McElhinny said. “We should
be able to choose whatever
we want, whether it’s higher
or lower.”

Another student, Ryan
Minster, wrote that he
believes Pitt misled him and
hisfamily about how often he
would eat. The outline of the
meal plan that Pitt sent to his
family seemed to emphasize
the possibility of running out

Student trip to Russia not a vacation

By Regan Morris
For The Pitt News

Childbirth can be one of the most joyful and

exciting times in a woman’s life.

With health care information, technology and
education way below Western standards in Russia,
childbirth is often a terrifying, humiliating and
many times a fatal experience for both women and

children.

Pitt’s Russian club is doing something to help

change this.

Eleven members of Pitt’s Russian club are plan-
ning a trip to Moscow in May to volunteer at
Savoir’s Hospital for Peace and Charity, a partner

of Magee-Womens Hospital.

The students are responsible for raising the

money for the trip.

“We are currently in the process of raising funds
for the trip,” said Dova Wilson, co-president of the

Russian club. “We’re planning a newsletter to send
to corporations and small business. If they know

who we are and ‘what we are, they may be more

willing to supply money.”

Magee and Savoir’s'began their partnership in
March 1992 in response to Magee’s desire to
improve the health care of women and children in

the former Soviet Union.

With death rates soaring and birth rates declin-

ing, Russia’s population stopped growing in 1991

and has been shrinking at an accelerated rate since.
Magee-Savoir’s clinical and educational pro-
grams focusing on pre—natal care, family planning,

breast self-examinations and birth control are revo-

lutionary for Russians. The Magee-Savoir partner-

of blocks rather than of hav-
ing too many, Minster wrote.

“The whole problem that
escalated this past term was
that people didn’t know how
wasteful they could be and
how many meals they were
going to have to eat per week
so they wouldn’t have meals
left over," Crowell said.

Crowell says the blame
doesn’t fall completely on
Food Services but students
need more education from
Food Services about the meal
plan.

Food Services should com-
municate with students about
how to “[pace] yourself with
your blocks and  avoid hav-
ing to dump your blocks at
the end,” she said.

Food disorders
common for
young women

By Nicole Walz '
Staff Writer

Barbara Mease suffered from
anorexia nervosa for 23 years
before she sought treatment.

It began with a teacher who
would hold the class during
lunch if they were bad. To spite
the teacher, Mease would not
eat lunch anyway.

It continued with disagree-
ments with her father. He tried
to control her life in too many
ways. She wanted control in

some part of her life. She chose ‘

food.

It is coming to end with her
treatment.

“My therapist was very nur-
turing and helpful. I didn’t
know how to eat right until
therapy,” said Mease.

Another college student made
herself binge on food and vomit
at least three times a week for
two years. She suffered from
bulimia nervosa.

Ninety percent of people suf-
fering from bulimia and
anorexia nervosa are female.
Adolescents and young adults
are the largest group to have
these diseases.

“In my clinical experience,
about 98 percent of [female
patients] that were of college
age were in college,” according
to Dr. Betty Chesler, an eating
disorders specialist in Squirrel
Hill.

Anorexia nervosa is an eating
disorder classified by several
things -- refusal to maintain

body weight at or above mini-

MOSCOW — Russian troops
closed in on the presidential
palace in the capital of sepa-
ratist Chechnya yesterday but
also suffered heavy losses in
their drive for control of the
city, according to a Russian
television report.

Independent NT V television
said troops were within 600
yards of President Dzhokar
Dudayev’s palace in Grozny
and putting the palace under
heavy artillery fire.

The television report said
Russian troops had failed to
capture the palace three times
Saturday night. —— Reuters
WASHINGTON —— The
United States, South Korea and
Japan will begin a new round
of talks today on plans to
finance $4 billion in new
nuclear technology as part of
the North Korea nuclear deal.

The talks are aimed at estab-
lishing an international organi-
zation called the Korean
Energy Development
Organization, which would
finance North Korea’s shift
from graphite nuclear reactors
to light-water reactors, the latter
of which produces less spent
fuel that could be used in
nuclear weapons.

South Korea and Japan are
expected to bear the majority of
the financial responsibilities.
The United States has promised

to organize the consortium in
return for North Korea agreeing
to halt and eventually dismantle

SACRAMENTO, Calif. —
Several hundred people protest-
ed Saturday as California Gov.
Pete iWilson celebrated the
beginning of his second tenn in
office.

Protesters said Wilson’s poli-
cies are racist, citing his sup-
port of Proposition 187, an ini-

tiative that would deny benefits ‘

to illegal immigrants which
was passed by California voters
in the November elections.

Proposition 187 has not yet
taken effect because of oppo-
nents’ legal attempts to veto the
initiative. If enacted, the initia-
tive would cut off non—emer—
gency health care, education
and welfare to California’s esti-
mated 1.7 million illegal immi-
grants. — Reuters

BOSTON — State and federal
prosecutors discussed who will
get first crack at putting John
Salvi on trial for murdering two
abortion clinic workers on Dec.
30.

Salvi, accused of fatally
shooting two women and
wounding five other people at
two Boston-area abortion clin-
ics, could be the first person to
face the death penalty under the
federal crime bill last year. The
act calls for the execution of

offenders who commit violent
felonies in which a death
occurs from the use of a
firearm.

Federal authorities can take
over a case when a suspect
commits crimes in more than
one state. Salvi is also accused
of firing 23 bullets into the
front of an abortion clinic in
Norfolk, Va., a day after the
Boston shootings.

Meanwhile, a Time/CNN
poll released Saturday showed
that 57 percent'of those polled
say recent shootings at abortion
clinics make them less sympa-
thetic to groups who oppose
abortion. — Reuters

CHICAGO — A teenage
mother is being held on a
$500,000 bond after being
accused of hiding her pregnan-
cy and critically injuring her
newborn by tossing it out a
window.

Named Zoe by hospital
workers, the baby girl remains
in critical condition with skull
fractures suffered in the fall
Wednesday and hypothermia
from the sub—zero temperatures.

A custody hearing is set for
today to determine if the baby
will be put up for adoption or
given to relatives.

If convicted of aggravated

Marisol Melendez, faces five to

President of Alumni Association has impressive record

By Linda Wisniewski
For The Pitt News

Lining the walls of his
office are pictures Of himself
with such people as
President Clinton, former
presidents Jimmy Carter and
George Bush, and also Dan
Quayle, just to name a few.

J. Roger Glunt, the new
president of Pitt’s Alumni
Association, seems to know
everyone who is anyone in
Washington.

Glunt, who was elected
president by the university’s
board of directors in June,
instantly helped to expand
the capacity of the associa-
tion.

He did this by directing a
15-member strategic plan-
ning committee in the execu-
tion of such projects as form-
ing an alumni advocacy task
force, gathering funds to
sponsor an alumni scholar-
ship program, instituting the
Blue and Gold Society,
developing a communica-
tions program, updating its

bylaws and instituting the’

first-ever newsletter, Alumni
Connections, to all Pitt
Alumni, along with many
other accomplishments.

Glunt, a 1960 business
graduate Of Pitt, was very
busy while he was on cam-
pus, and has not slacked Off
since.

While in school, he was a
commander in the Reserve
Officer Training Corps, the
Pitt band’s trumpet section
leader and president of his
fraternity.

“Those were my primary

activities,” said Glunt. “I had

leadership positions in all of
them.”

“I still graduated in four
years,” he said.

Since then, his leadership
qualities have not dimin-
ished._

Glunt went on to co-found I

a construction company with
his father in 1966.

The Glunt Building Co.,
Inc., which he is currently
president of, began as a com-
pany that built single-family
homes. Since then, it has
developed into the areas of
multi—family construction,
residential remodeling, prop-
erty management and real
estate sales.

Glunt, who has remained

very active in Pitt’s alumni
affairs since graduation, has
been the Pitt Band Alumni
Association president since
1977, and most recently was
the 54th president of the
National Association of
Home Builders in 1993,
which has 7 million mem-
bers.

Glunt is the first
Pennsylvanian to hold the
NAHB presidency.

“I’m probably out of town
at least 14 days every
month,” said Glunt. “I still
travel a great deal for the
NAHB.”

While president of the
NAHB, Glunt appeared on
the front page of USA Today
in June of 1993 with
President Clinton, when he
was given the opportunity‘ to
introduce the president when
he appeared at a construction
site just Outside of

Washington.

“It’s really amazing, the
power Of the press, when you
show up on the cover of USA‘
Today,” said Glunt. He said
people he had not seen in

 

years contacted him about it.

The alumni association has
two major goals for 1995,
“tO communicate and to con-
nect,” he said.

“We are communicating
through our publication,
Alumni Connections, and
connecting with our new
membership dues program,”
he said.

Glunt said the alumni asso-
ciation plans On primarily
expanding its membership
through its communicating
and connecting program.

“We are growing in
strength,” he said. “I know
we have a sleeping giant out
there somewhere.”

An annual membership to
the Pitt Alumni Association
is $35, and entitles its mem-
bers to receiving the associa-
tion’s newsletter as well as
discounts at the University
Book Center, on car rentals,
hotels, moving companies
and many other things.

“We also want to make
alumni advocates of Pitt,”
said Glunt.

Glunt said they would like

to gain advocates to promote
the financial status of Pitt, as
well as public affairs, legis-
lation and the recruiting Of
students.

“Something I’m really
excited about is the Blue and
Gold society,” he said. “It’s a
really neat activity.”

The Blue and Gold Society
aims at making leaders out
of Pitt students, and focuses
on bestowing them with a
lifelong appreciation of the
university.

The society consists of
undergraduate students who
possess outstanding academ-
ic ability and leadership
qualities.

Glunt said he would also
like to see the singing of the
alma mater taken more seri-
ously and done with more
pride.

“Every time the alumni
association meets, we close
by singing the alma mater,”
said Glunt.

“When I was in school, the
brothers of my fraternity
were known for a lot of
things, but one of them was

3

singing,” he said.

Glunt said even though
much of Pitt will never
change. such as the
Cathedral of Learning and
Heinz Chapel, a lot of things
were different when he was
in school.

“When I was there, Forbes
Field was there,” he said.
“I’d be sitting in class in the
Cathedral and hear the crack
of the bat, and my thoughts
would drift right out the win-
dOw.”

Glunt is very modest when
speaking of the success he
has had in life, and attributes
most of it to the luck of the
draw.

“I was very fortunate to be
in the right place at the right
time, and I guess I did the
right things,” he said.

“I’m very proud to be pres-
ident Of Pitt’s Alumni

Association,” he said. “Pitt

gave me a lot, and the suc-
cess I achieved in life was
because I went to Pitt.”

“In some small way, I
would like to give back to
Pitt what Pitt gave to me.”

Disorders-

°From page 1

mally normal weight for a per-
son's age and height, intense
fear of gaining weight or
becoming fat, denial of the seri-
ousness of current low body
weight and the absence of at
least three consecutive menstru-
al cycles.

There are two types of
anorexia nervosa. One involves
restricting food intake, and the
other is a binge eating/purging
type who will have episodes of
binge eating or purging com-
bined with the food restriction.
Between .5 percent and l per-
cent of females in late adoles-
cence and early adulthood suffer
from anorexia nervosa.

Bulimia anorexia is another
eating disorder classified by
recurrent episodes of binge eat-
ing and sense of a lack of con-
trol during those episodes,
recurrent weight prevention
measures such as vomiting, mis-
use of laxatives, excessive exer-
cise, behaviors occur at least
twice a week for three months
and self-evaluation is inﬂuenced
by body shape and weight.
About 1 to 3 percent of people
suffer from bulimia nervosa.

Although there is no reported
percentage, many people suffer
from eating disorders not other-
wise specified, such as binge
eating and food restriction with
vomiting. Typically these indi-
viduals meet some, but not all,
of the criteria of bulimia or
anorexia nervosa.

Chesler said eating disorders
can develop in “a person that is
dieting plus one of these many
things: substance abuse, depres-
sion, experiences a traumatic
event, has been sexually abused
or parents are alcoholics. Most,
if not all the disorders start with
dieting.”

An extreme fear of becoming
fat is another motivation behind
eating disorders. ‘

“Cultural expectations of thin-
ness greatly inﬂuence the pro-

motion of eating disorders. .

Between 1979 and 1988, 60 per-
cent of Miss Americas met the
criteria for anorexia nervosa,”
said Chesler.

“Society puts on such false
adoration on being thin. No girl
wants to be fat, but you can eat
without becoming fat. [With
anorexia] you start to form your
own world, and pretty soon the
real world is not part of yours,”
said Mease. “It becomes your
life so there is nothing else.”

“They would never say,
‘You’re really intelligent or you
have a good personality.’ I got
straight A’s in high school, but
no one said ‘Oh, you’re so
smart.’ The only compliment I
got was on being thin,” said
Mease.

If someone is suffering from
an eating disorder, she may have
many of these signs and symp-
toms:

°losing weight.

-exhibiting discomfort eating
with others: picking at food, not
ﬁnishing meals, unwilling to eat
out.

°eating non—fat foods, refusing
sweets or deserts.

BLOCKS

°From page 1

cellor for business and finance, Crowell
said a president’s council will be held
early this term where the Division of
Business and Finance and the
Department of Food Services will field
questions. Also, SGB will sponsor an
open forum where students can voice
their concerns.

Sallade-Farina said the BLOCK plan
demands more responsibility from stu-
dents than past meal plans.

“We’ve gone to a concept of giving
students the responsibility of managing
their own meal plan,” she said. “This is
head and shoulders above the 14 and 19
meal plans of last year.”

Under the old meal plan, freshman res-
ident students were required to buy
either a 14 meal per week plan or 19
meal per week plan.

According to Crowell, DeVitto said
statistics illustrate that the BLOCK plan
has been less wasteful than past meal
plans. An average of 53 percent of the
meals students paid for on the old plan
went unused. Last semester, under the
BLOCK plan, only 10 percent went
unused.

_ Sallade-Farina said she will meet with
SGB soon to discuss the BLOCK plan.
Food Services continued its refinement
of the plan with the announcement of a
policy change in a letter last week.
Students can no longer use more than
three blocks per transaction. But if stu-
dents are still hungry after eating, they

  

We offer:

APE you serious ulooui
STUDYING ABROAD?

  

can go back in line and use more blocks.

Crowell said she believes this is a
responsible rule and that she understands
that Food Services may have to continue
to refine the BLOCK plan.

But some students complained about
the way in which Food Services made
adjustments last semester. A “BLOCK
party” at Eddie’s allowed students to
quickly unload blocks, but at a high
price.

At the block party, a student could buy
a case of Coca-Cola, for example, for 10
blocks. That means, since one block
equals $5 during dinner time, the stu-
dent, by using up 10 blocks, would be
paying an equivalent of $50 for an item
with a typical retail price of about $7.

Students were also given the opportu-
nity to transfer their blocks into choice
dollars, which do carry over into the
next semester.

According to the SGB letter, those
specific days were poorly publicized.
Some students said the time was too

short and missed the opportunity

because they didn’t have time to wait in
the long lines.

Also, a limitation imposed by Food
Services on how many blocks students
could use at one time in the Residence
Hall convenience store caught some stu-
dents off-guard. Food Services later
increased the limit from one block to
two blocks, but some students don’t
think there should be any limits.

“I feel that we should use the blocks

any way we please,” Tanya Lopez wrote.
“The blocks are our money, so we
should be able to say what we buy with
them, how we buy and how much we
buy. I paid $900 for my meal plan, and I
should be given the opportunity to spend
all $900.”

Lopez was on the 280 BLOCK meal
plan, and two days before the end of the
semester, she had 140 left.

Food Services placed the constraint on
student block spending at the conve-
nience store because some students
abused the privilege, Sallade-Farina
wrote to The Pitt News.

Pitt can't afford to allow students to
use their blocks at the convenience store
for large bulk purchases, Sallade-Farina
wrote. Pitt began accepting blocks at the
convenience store only as a supplement
to the student’s meal plan, for the pur-
chase of snacks, not as an “alternate
meal plan.”

Crowell said students who had blocks
left over last semester won’t be compen-
sated. McElhinny, who was left with
excess blocks, said she understands that
with a new plan comes problems and
glitches, but was “kind of disgusted”
with the way it was handled.

“That’s done and over with,” she said.
She plans to adjust the amount of blocks
she get on her meal plan next year so
that she doesn’t have to buy food she
doesn’t want.

“I’m going to get the lowest possible,”
she said.

Trip
‘From page I

ship has made news recently

with visits from Hillary Clinton,

Jane Fonda and Naina Yeltsin.

The club members, all Pitt stu-
dents, most of whom are major-
ing in Russian, will volunteer
their time for one month, partici-
pating in health reform first
hand while improving their lan-
guage skills. Magee guarantees
the positions as volunteers, pro-
vides three month visas and will
help the students to find hous-
ing.

Stephanie LeDonne is the
other co-president of the
Russian club.

The eleven students are at dif-
ferent levels in their Russian
studies, ranging from fluent
seniors to a first-year student.
Wilson, LeDonne and several
other members have been to
Russia and the former Soviet
Union before. During a recent
club meeting, they shared travel-
ing experiences.

LeDonne described a Mafia-
run hostel she and Wilson had
stayed in: “It’s way too danger-
ous. Definitely not suitable for
this trip.”

The students also discussed ‘

options for housing at the meet-
ing. They are considering
dorms, hostels and homestays.

“Homestays are interesting
and especially beneficial if you
want to improve your lan-
guage,” said \V1lson, who, while
staying with a family, slept on
the stove. “It wasn’t like one of
ours. It was long, long enough to
lay on.”

Laughing, one of the members
said, “That’s just so Russian.”

Disorders-

°eating irregularly or skipping

°stashing sweets in her room.

-going to the bathroom or
exercising following the con-
sumption of food.

°withdrawing from others.

°missing food.

-ﬁnding traces of vomit in the

-very loose or baggy clothing.

Chesler said the most impor-
tant thing to do is to recognize
that the eating disorder is not a
weakness or a character defect,
but rather an illness that often
involves depression and requires
treatment.

“People who suffer from eat-
ing disorders are not weird.
They want to be supported and
accepted. If people treat it like
an illness, people suffering from

the disorder may be more will-

ing to go for treatment,” she
said.
If you suspect someone you

-know may suffer from an eating
disorder, gently confront them, .

encourage them to seek treat-
ment from an eating disorder
specialist and provide emotional
support, Chesler suggested.

Chesler said if a person seeks
treatment from an eating disor-
ders specialist, “people will be
finished with the eating disorder
and have a new way of thinking
they never had before.”

Environment

°From page I

said they look for products that have been
recycled and are safe for the environment; of
those, 58 percent said they would be willing
to pay more for environmentally safe prod-
ucts.

Of the students who said they did not recy-
cle, many said the main reason they don’t is
because it’s too much trouble, said
spokesperson Tara McKenzie.

While many of the students said they think
their colleges and universities are environ-
mentally conscious, 71 percent would like to
see even more environmental awareness and
activities on campuses.

Many students do not participate in orga-
nized environmental groups on their cam-
puses even if they are environmentally
aware.

“We asked if they are involved in any
organization, and a surprisingly low number
said they were,” McKenzie said. ‘‘It seems
that while they make efforts to recycle, they
do not become environmental activists.”

The survey said that in the student’s opin-
ion, some of the most important environ-
mental problems are endangered plants and
animals, population growth and loss of tropi-

cal rain forests.

Some Pitt students said they agree with the
survey and that the environment is worse
now than it was five years ago.

-“I think recycling is catching on more,”
said freshman Hal Turner. “But there still is
a long way to go.”

Freshman Brandon Snavely agreed.

“Recycling for glass and paper is not very
widespread, and it’s not actively encouraged
by the university,” Snavely said.

Both students considered themselves more
environmentally active at home than at
school. ‘

“I’m _more conscious here [at school], but
less active because I can’t do anything about
it. As I throw away more and more bottles, I
become increasingly more conscious,”
Turner said. “At home I would just throw
things in the recycling bin and not even
think about it.” p

Junior Marcus Lowenstein added that he
thought there should be more recycling bins.

”“There’s no recycling bins [on campus].
Come up to my room and see all the glass
bottles that are piling up. I don’t know what
I’m going to do with them,” Lowenstein
said.

_ From here,
- “logout” and leave the machine.

Opinions

The Pitt News

Monday, January 9, 1995

New management  

The 1995 Pitt News season has begun with the editorial
page under new management. With this, a few changes have
been instituted. This column will describe the differences
between the various wells of insight which will appear
throughout the semester and their relation to The Pitt News.

This column is the daily unsigned editorial, which repre-

sents the opinion of the majority of the editorial board. It is.-

not the opinion of any one editor. So don’t come up to punch
the Opinions editor in the nose if you read something that you
don’t like, write a letter instead.

Letters are contributions sent in by any member of the uni-
versity community. They can come from undergraduates,
graduate students, professors, or anyone else connected with
the university. They are not written by staff writers or any
other paid employees of The Pitt News. Letters do not repre-
sent the opinion of this paper or anyone else other than the
author.

Anyone wishing to submit a letter to the editor can either
drop it off in the opinions editor box in 434 William Pitt
Union or mail it to that address. Letters can also be sent
through electronic mail _ to
PITTNEWS@VMS.CIS.PITT.EDU. All letters must include a
telephone number so that the author can be verified. Letters to
the editor must also be kept under 250 words. Any letters
longer than 250 words will either go unpublished or be edited
at the editor’s discretion to meet the limit. V

Letters will include the author’s name and university affilia-
tion at the bottom. So if you see “John Smith, CAS ‘00”
you’ll know it’s a letter. Telephone numbers are for the use of
the editorial staff only.

Columns are where well—researched proselyting is supposed
to take place. The writers express their opinions, which,
although they are on our payroll, do not represent the opinion
of the newspaper.

New columnists are always welcome, if they are willing to
put their views before the university community. Interested
writers should come to 434 William Pitt union in the evenings
and speak with the opinions editor or managing editor.

The object of the Opinions page is to provide a forum for
the campus community to debate issues. These can be issues
dealing with campus concerns, local concerns, politics or
world issues. It is not a place to conduct private debates in
front of‘ the campus community, so columns in response to
columns are discouraged.

Cartoons are the funny line drawings at the top of the page.
They ought to be fairly self-explanatory.

Finally, although freedom of speech and the press are guar-
anteed, freedom of access is not. The Pitt News does nothave
to print any views unchallenged and is not a soapbox for mili-
tants, zealots andradicals to present their opinions as fact.
With that said, here’s to a year of controversies which will
keep this page full.

dissatisfaction with

Gingrich holds ephemeral power

ell, the dawn of the
 new year has also
, brought the dawn of
the new Congress, and the
nation has gone Newt -——- at
least according to the national
media. Newt Gingrich, with the
new-found Republican majori-
ty \ in the House of
Representatives, is revelling in
his new-found power as
Speaker of the House. But how
long will this power last?
Probably not for long.

It is no big secret why the
Republicans did so well in the
1994 elections, the voting pub-
lie was dissatisfied with
President Bill Clinton. But then
again there is no big secret as
to why Clinton was elected in
1992, it was because of voter
then
President Bush. The American
people are dissatisfied in gen-
eral right now, and whoever is
in power will bear the brunt of
their backlash. Unfortunately
for Gingrich, the current per-
ception is that he is the one in
power. Even more unfortunate
for him is that this is probably
not true; however, the percep-
tion will still be that he is.

Let me explain. Right now
Gingrich is trying to solidify as
much power as he can, and he
is being treated by the media
more like a new president than
a brand new Speaker. When
was the last time a Speaker of
the House (or any other mem-
ber of Congress for that matter)
was the main topic of political
conversation? Congress as a
whole has certainly received a
tremendous amount of media
coverage the last few years,
most of it negative, but now
one man is being represented
as speaking for Congress. Also,
the petty scandals that usually
chase a president around are
already starting to chase the
Newt around. First, there was
the $4 million dollar book sign-
ing bonus scandal. Then came
the telling his mother Hillary

Clinton was a “bitch” scandal.
These little, one could even
call them silly, scandals never
help a politician. How much
they hurt varies greatly, but if
you build up enough of them
they can certainly hurt your
public opinion polls — just ask
Bill Clinton. Newt Gingrich,
though, seems to be well on his
way to replacing Clinton  the
focus of petty media scandals.

And what about that new-
found power of Speaker
Gingrich, is he really as power-
ful as people say? He certainly
has a great deal of power, more
so than any Speaker in'memo—
ry, but he certainly does not
speak for Congress. Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole has
never let anyone speak for him,
and he is certainly not about to
let Newt Gingrich start. And
there are already reports sur-
facing of tensions between the
two Republican leaders. Just
imagine what those tensions
will be like when the ‘96 presi-
dential campaign really begins
to kick in.

For right now, Newt does
speak for the House of
Representatives, but one must
question how long that will
last. First of all, the Republican
majority is by no means large.
The Republicans have been
known for theirparty loyalty,
but then again that was when
they were in the minority and
they had to stick together. It
remains to be seen whether or
not they will do so when they
are in power. There are a num-
ber of moderate Republicans
out there, Republicans who are
not completely in agreement
with the far right views of
Newt Gingrich. After
Gingrich’s “honeymoon” is
over, it may not be so easy to
pass everything he wants. He is
smart to focus his agenda on
the first hundred days, because
the farther we get from the last
election and the closer we get
to the next, people are going to

start asking “What have you
done for me. Newt?” And his
power will begin to weaken.

Also, itmust be remembered
that passing something through
the House of Representatives
accomplishes absolutely noth-
ing. For a bill to become a law,
it must also  the Senate and
be signed by the president. In
the Senate, the Republican
majority is not nearly large
enough to stop Democratic fili-
busters, a tactic the
Republicans used to perfection.
And if Clinton decides to veto
anything, there are not nearly
enough Republican votes in
either the House or the Senate
to override Clinton’s veto.

But probably the most
important thing to keep in mind
is that the American people are
still far from happy with
Congress. Even though
Clinton’s approval rating was
horrible last year, Congress’
was far lower. Granted there is
a new Congress in power now,
but they do not get the benefit
of the doubt simply because
they are new or because they
are Republicans. Newt
Gingrich must still satisfy the
American people, and they
have proven to be difficult to
satisfy. Remember that during
Clinton’s presidency the econo-
my has been growing faster
than in many years, unemploy-
ment reached its lowest levels
since the Reagan administra-
tion anddeficit spending actu-
ally decreased. Unless
Gingrich can bring the percep-
tion of prosperity, ‘ the
American people will not be
satisfied him, and when a
politician does not have the
people behind him his power
base quickly erodes.

Newt Gingrich had better
enjoy his current power,
because it will likely not last
for long.

Out of

ohn

Thomp-

son
hasn’t
changed
much in his
23 years as
Georgetown's
head basket-
ball coach.
With a career
record of
503-190
(.725 winning percentage),
there has been no need to.

John Thompson will always
be John Thompson.
Notoriously known as a big
man’s coach, he always lures
the best centers in the country
to Georgetown with promise
of the whole offense revolving
around them. And for 23 years
that has been true.

That was until this year.

The man who stoically
stands on the sidelines with a
towel draped over his shoulder
got a late surprise in the
recruiting wars when he
signed point guard Allen
Iverson. A

Iverson, who averaged 31.6
points, 8.7 rebounds and 9.2
assists a game as a junior at
Bethel High School in
Hampton, Va., didn’t play his
senior year because in was in
jail.

Iverson served time after
being involved in a bowling
alley brawl and was convicted
of mob action for hitting a girl
in the head with a chair.

Most coaches gave up on
Iverson, who was the
Associated Press Player of the
Year in basketball and football
as a junior, because no one
knew when he would be
released.

Not Thompson. He stuck
with Iverson, and consequent-
ly it changed the whole com-
plexion of Georgetown basket-
ball.

The Thompson style of
bully-ball is history. Enter the
new and improved Hoya style

“ give the ball to the light-
ning quick 6—foot-1-inch
Iverson and let him do his
stuff.

And it’s paying huge divi-
dends. Georgetown is 9-1 and
ranked 12th in the country
with Iverson at the helm.

With all the preseason hype
surrounding freshman phenom
Felipe Lopez, Iverson has
stolen the center stage as he
leads the Big East in scoring
with a 20.8 point average.
Fittingly for an ex—convict, he
also leads the conference in
thefts with 2.89 a game.

All Thompson has to do is

Friars outma PH 85-81, wnless in Big East

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

The Big East season is
now in full throttle, but Pitt
has yet to take off.

The Panthers, 0-3 in the
conference and 4-7 overall,
were denied their first Big
East win, this time to the
host Providence Friars on
Saturday, 85-81.

And last Tuesday, Pitt lit-
erally threw
the game
away with
35 turnovers
a g a i 11 st
Georgetown
at the Civic

Arena, losing 55-46.

But against Providence,
the loss wasn’t attributable
to Pitt’s carelessness. The
Panthers just didn’t have
enough fire power to hang
with the Friars’ hot hand, as
they shot 50 percent from
the field.

“I can’t fault the kids,”
coach Ralph Willard said at
a postgame interview,
“There’s just no room for
error for them. Asking seven
kids to play against their
whole team just isn’t fair. I
can’t be any prouder for our
kids.”

Pitt saw three of its open-
ing shots get blocked, as
Providence jumped out to a
10-2 lead on a 10-foot
jumper by Jason Murdock,
the brother of ex-Providence
star Eric Murdock.

Providence extended its

largest lead to 14 points with
a pair of Eric Williams free
throws with 8:13 remaining

While most of Pittsburgh
was home watching the
Steelers play the Browns
Saturday afternoon, a sparse
crowd at Fitzgerald Field
House was witness to an

explosion.
An offensive
explosion in
the form of a
49-point
second half
that pro-

Pitt Lady Panthers to a 73-61
Big East conference victory
over the Miami Hurricanes.

The Lady Panthers used a
13-0 run midway through the
second half to turn a three-
point deficit into a 10-point
cushion.

Pitt was behind 40-37 after
Miami’s leading scorer
Octavia Blue staged a five-
minute personal offensive
clinic to single—handedly
keep the ‘Canes in the game.
During that span early in the
second half, Blue scored 10

drops to
No. 17
Lehigh

By Eric Garver
For The Pitt News

The No. 22 Pitt wrestling
team dropped its first home
match of the year Thursday
night, which dropped its record
to 3-2 overall with a closel7—l5
loss to the No. 17 Lehigh
Engineers.

Lehigh took the first three
matches from the Panthers to
build an early 10-0 lead, which
proved unsurmountable for Pitt.

“Being down like that is
tough, but you’ve got to believe
that the rest of your team can
come on and help you out,”
said veteran head coach Rande
Stottlemyer. “lt’s an individual
as well as a team sport, and it’s
the little things sometimes that
add up. A takedown here or an
escape there and we would

have been right there with
them.”

In the first match at 118
pounds, sophomore Chris
Stevens lost a 12-5 decision to
Mark Sferra, to give Lehigh a
quick three-point lead.

At the 134—pound weight
class, freshman Chad Jesko,
who usually starts at 126 but
moved into the 134 slot due to a
viral infection to the eye of
usual starter John Richey,
dropped a 4-1 match to Lehigh’s
Jung Lee.

Jesko’s replacement at 126,
usual 118-pounder Eric
Knopsnyder, didn’t fare any bet-
ter as he had a 15-7 major deci-
sion loss to Lehigh junior Jason
Kutz. Knopsnyder nearly lost
due to a technical fall (15
points), down 14-1 in the final
period, until he put together an
escape, takedown and three-
point near fall in the final :30 of
the match. The combination was
one of the high points of the
meet, and if Knopsnyder would

let the bird out of his cage and
let nature take its course.
Iverson has already earned the
Big East Freshman of the
Week three times, and he is
only the second Hoya in
Thompson’s era to have
scored back-to-back 30-point
games.

Iverson likes to shoot (the
ball, that is). This is very rare .
on a Thompson team. Very
seldom does a point guard get
a chance to shine in
Georgetown’s system (except
Eric “Sleepy” Floyd), espe-
cially a freshman.

Iverson was incarcerated for
most of the night last Tuesday
when the Hoyas visited the
Civic Arena. Although he
scored a team-high 15 points,
he only converted 5 of 17 from
the field.

Nevertheless, Iverson is
something special. He has to
be if a freshman can change
Thompson’s system.

Just don’t go bowling with
him.

have scored the pin, the
Panthers could possibly have
won the meet.

After the losses at 126 and
134, Pitt was down 10-0.

However, Pitt scored all of
their team points in the middle
and higher weights, and it
looked like the big guns would
come through once again.

Junior J.J. Fasnacht, with a
team-high 12 wins, kept rolling
along this season with a 7-3
decision over senior John
McCumber of Lehigh, picking
up Pitt’s first team points and
making the score 10-3.

Redshirt freshman Larry
Sprecher, at 150, also continued
his winning ways, raising his
record to 11-4 on the season
with a 6-4 win over Ed Andres.
Following this match the
Panthers were down only 10-6
and appeared to be making a
comeback.

Without a doubt the most
exciting matchup of the night
was at 158, where Lehigh senior
Steve Cassidy defeated sopho-

more John Withrow in sudden
death overtime, 3-2. Withrow
gave up a two-point reversal
after starting the period on top,
but gained an escape in the sec-
ond and also one in the third
after starting the period down to
go into overtime. After a score-
less first overtime period,
Cassidy won the toss and chose
the down position for sudden
death. From there Withrow just
couldn’t hold on, and Cassidy
escaped for the point andthe
victory, putting Pitt down 13-6.
“It was another of those
matches we could have won just
as easily. The whole match was
just filled with suspense, espe-
cially after he went to over-
time,” said Stottlemyer. “We
were waiting for him to get that
takedown in the overtime peri-
od, but it just never broke. Sure,
it would’ve been nice to win the
coin ﬂip, but they both wrestled
a really good match.”

gave the ‘Canes the three
point edge.

But almost immediately
after the last jump shot fell,
Blue got her fourth foul and
the entire complexion of the
game changed. A ’

“Once she got her fourth,
her attitude changed,” Pitt
coach Kirk Bruce said. “She
got tentative and took some
bad shots. She lost her
aggressiveness and we took
advantage.”

As Blue faltered, the Lady
Panther fast break shifted

A into high gear.

The run started when
Panther center Missy
Thompson went strong to the
basket and converted a three-
point play that deadlocked
the game at 40-40. 1

Miami’ looked unorga-
nized, confused and out of
sync as point guard Carol
Morton turned a ‘Cane
turnover into two free throws
and a 42-40 Panther lead.

The. run continued on a
Thompson bucket inside, a
layup by Jenine Joyce and a
soft runner in the middle of
the lane by back-up point
guard JoJo Guzman.

By the time Miami coach
Ferne Labati decided to call
time out to calm ‘her team,
Pitt was comfortably ahead
48-40. Latia Howard would
add a bucket following the
timeout to put Pitt up by 10.
Just as it looked like the
game was turning into a rout,
‘Cane forward Christine
Olsen made a layup that
broke the four-minute Miami
scoreless drought.

The Lady Panthers had
leads as high as 14 andas
low as six in the second half

before finally icing the game .

in ‘the waning moments on
free throws by Howard,
Joyce and Stephanie Petho.

“I knew that if we got a
seven—point lead that it was
our game,” Bruce said. “We
really got it going in the sec-
ond half.”

That was an understate-
ment, as Pitt shot a sizzling
63 percent from the field.
The Hurricanes simply could

not keep up with the hot
shooung.

But the big second half
was preceded by a sloppy
first half that saw the Lady
Panthers make numerous
mistakes and shoot a dismal

33 percent from the field.

The teams went into the

‘locker rooms deadlocked at

24-24.

“We missed layups, we
travelled and we turned the
ball over,” Bruce said. “We

could have easily been up '

10. We knew that we hadn’t
played that good and we
weren’t losing.”

In the second half, the
Panthers looked like a differ-.

ent team as they practically

ran the Hurricanes off the
court. Q
“We felt that we finally got

it in gear,” Bruce said.

“Anytime that you score 49
points in a half, you should
win. -
“We came out and we ran.
We felt like we played the
second half like we’re capa-
ble of playing all the time.”

The Panther attack was a
balanced one with four play-
ers . ‘in double digits.
Thompson was the high
scorer with 15.

Pitt also got a strong per-
formance from the point
guard tandem of Morton and
Guzman. .

“They did a nice job for
us,” Bruce said. “Carol had
10 rebounds, and JoJo ‘came
in.a played under control.
She had no turnovers and
made a couple of nice deci-
sions.”

The win improved the sur-
prising Lady Panthers to 9-3
and 3-1 in conference. For a
team that was picked by
many preseason publications
to finish near the bottom,
Pitt is proving the critics
wrong.

“We don’t listen to what
people say,” Bruce, said.
“Our expectations are high.
We expect to win.”

subsequent win.

With Pittsburgh down only
17-12, this put the pressure on
undefeated two—time NCAA

Lehigh sophomore Bill Closson

However, Closson stayed

21 points, buried a three-
pointer to slice the lead to
36-28 with 1:13 remaining.
Then, Orlando Antigua hit
another three to cut the lead
to five.

With eight seconds remain-
ing Franklin Western nailed
a jumper, but Pitt retaliated
with Jaime Peterson’s
buzzer—beating layup, and
the Panthers headed into the
locker room down 38-33.
More importantly, however,
the momentum had begun to
shift to Pitt’s favor, or so it
seemed.

But Pitt had no answer for
Providence’s star forward
Williams, who reeled off 20
second half points to finish
with a game-high 27.

“Eric Williams is a pro,
that’s the bottom line,”
Willard said. _“I think he’s
the premier player in the
league because. he does it
all.”

The Panthers also couldn’t
stop Friar center Troy

Brown, who finished with 21 4

points and 11 boards.

A pair of three-pointers by
Thomas kept Pitt within
striking distance early in the
second half, and the steady
play of point man Andre
Alridge allowed the Panthers
to make a late run.

Alridge, who didn’t prac-
tice the two days prior to the
game because of sickness,
scored 21 points, but more
importantly, only had two
turnovers. A

Plagued by turnovers the

whole season, Pitt only had
15, nine under its average.
. But whatreally hurt Pitt
late in the game was sole
center Peterson fouling out
with 2:32 remaining. Couple
that with Antigua fouling out
with 48 seconds left and for-
ward Chad Varga out of the
line up for four to six weeks
with an injured wrist, Pitt
wasstrapped down low.

Peterson finished with 12
points and 10 rebounds, but
missed a lot of easy shots in
the process.

“If Jaime comes in and
plays like he did against
Georgetown, we win the
game,” Willard said.

Turning Over

It was the classic Pitt-
Georgetown matchup -— a

low-scoring, smashmouth
affair that left the fans rest-
less and the coaches in dis-
belief.

And last Tuesday was no
different at the Civic Arena,
as Pitt turned the ball over
35 times in its 55-46 loss to
the No. 12 Hoyas.

“It was a very strange
game,” Georgetown coach
John Thompson said. “I told
the kids that you would look
out there and wonder what
was going on. Both teams
did their best to mess the
whole situation up.”

In the end, Pitt squandered
several opportunities, mostly
due to careless turnovers —
21 in the second half — as
the Hoyas sealed their victo-
ry with free throws.

Tied at 40 with 8:50
remaining, Pitt managed to
score only six more points
the rest of the game.

Then the Hoyas took the
lead permanently on fresh-
man sensation Allen
Iverson’s slicing jumper.
Iverson. who averages 21.5
points a game, was limited to
15, which mostly came on
garbage free throws at the
end of the game.

Down by four, Andre
Alridge buried a three, and
after the two teams
exchanged hoops, Pitt was
down 46-45 with 6:20 left.

Pitt wouldn’t score again
until 38 seconds remaining
on Varga’s free throw split.

“You know, there’s not
much we can say about
tonight,” Willard said.
“Physically, we have been
overmatched at the guard
position. A team like
Georgetown that runs and
jumps — you must penetrate.

Unfortunately, we don’t have ‘

the personnel right now to do
that.

“We did a good job defen-
sively. We denied Iverson.
We focused and did a great
job rebounding. Our problem
right now is offense.”

With all Georgetown’s
bulk in the middle, Peterson
finished with a game-high 17

:points and collected 12

boards. Alridge, who was
the Big East Player of the
Week two weeks ago, ended
with 12 points and nine
turnovers.

“We definitely had the
game won, but we just gave
it away,” Alridge said.

There will be a sports
writers meeting today at
5 p.m. in 434 William Pitt

Union. All writers must
attend and new writers
are welcome.
