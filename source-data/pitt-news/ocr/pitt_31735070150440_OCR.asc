Voter ID

takes center

stage at
library '
Gideon Bradshaw
‘Stag?’ Writer

If Pennsylvania’s voter ID law is
upheld when it goes before the
state Supreme Court this Thurs-
day,]on Pushinsky’s veteran father
wouldn’t have been able to vote in
the upcoming election.

Pushinsky, a Pittsburgh lawyer
who has cooperatedwith the ACLU
as a volunteer for more‘than 30
years, was one of the 15 people who
spoke critically of Pennsylvania’s
voter ID law during a community
meeting held at the Monroeville
Public Library Monday night. Op-
ponents of the legislation — Push-
insky- among them — claim that it
is aimedat keeping minorities and
thefpoor out of the polling booths.

“If your next-door neighbor

. is working at the polling station

when you go to vote, and [he or
she}... knows who you are, does he
or she have to ask you for ID? The
answer is yes,” Pushinsky said,
adding that those monitoring poll-
ing stations who fail to check voter
IDs could face prosecution under
the new law. ' . V
4 T  Pushinsky said thatihis own fa-
ther was an example of a voter for
whom the law poses diﬂiculties.
The D—Day veteran, I who moved
into the Pittsburgh area from
Florida when he fell sick two years
ago, was too frail to obtain a Penn-
sylvania driver’s license when he
relocated. As soon as he learned
about the law, he became very con-
cerned that he would be unable to
vote in this year’s presidential elec-
tion and offered to join the ACLU’s
lawsuit.

Veterans student group keeps camaraderie strong

Joe Chilson
Staff Wrz'ter

To an outsider, a gathering
of the Student Veterans As-
sociation at Pitt sounds like a
meeting of people speaking a
foreign language filled with ac-
ronyms, numbers and far-off
places.

But this club provides vet-
erans at Pitt a chance to get to
know people like them — peo-
ple who also speak their lan-

guage.

The group, also known as
Pitt Vets, reconvenes at Pitt
this year for the firsttime since
2007. William Cole, president
and founder of Pitt Vets, said
the club has two main purpos-
es: to educate the public and
advocate veterans issues on
campus and to provide avenue
for veterans to meet with other
veterans.

Pitt Vets’ second meeting
of the year was held over beer
and pizza at Mario’s East Side
Saloon in Shadyside last Thurs-

day. Many of the members,
who are all veterans of Iraq and
Afghanistan, said that good
company was what they appre-
ciated most about the newly
re—organized group.

On the night of the event, 15
vets and two -ROTC members
gathered around a shuffle-
board table. They immediately
started comfortable, if incom-
prehensible, conversations.
It was as if they’d known each
other for years. This is a hall-
mark of military relationships.

“Vets need to know how to
get to know each other quick 
you’ve got to know who you’re
dealing with if you’re going to
be in a ﬁreﬁght with someone,”
said Matt Hannan, a 15-year
veteran of the Marine Corps
and business manager of Pitt
Vets.

But whereas military re-
lationships might come easy,
some returning vets have trou-
ble re—adjusting to life outside

the service.

Jake jager, a_ computer science ma-
jor who spent four years as a helicop-
tel; electrician in the Navy, said it can
be challenging for veterans..to make
friends on campus because of the sig-
niﬁcant age and experience gap be-
tween themselves and other students.
Many of the vets who attended the
meeting at Mario’s ranged in age from
their late 20s to their late 30s and tend
to feel a lot older when hanging around
the average college student.

“It’s hard for me to go out and meet
people,” said Justin Bodamer, a junior
who did five years in the airborne in-
fantry. For him, Pitt Vets provides “a
good place to get advice and help and,
of course, make friends.”

This kind of support system is espe-
cially important to vets.

According to Cole, the military is
like a big family. It’s one of the stron-
gest networks someone can have, and
when a veteranleaves that support sys-
tem to re—enter society, it can be a cul-
ture shock. .

When Cole worked on his under-
graduate degree at the University of
California, Santa Barbara, the school
had an active veterans group and a class
focused on helping veterans—transition
back to civilian life.

“It really helped integrate into aca-

demic life,” Cole said.

B_ut when he came _to Pitt for grad
school last year, he was dismayed to
find that nosuch organization existed
here. One had been tried in 2006, but
it petered out after a year and left Pitt

’ with no ofﬁcial veterans support group.

So Cole began to work with other
vets, including Dr. Rory Cooper, the
group’s faculty advisor, and Hannan,

real quick, but having people around
who understand what you went through
is better than any counseling or pre-
scription a doctor could" give you.”

Hannan also said that Pitt Vets is es—i '

pecially helpful in this regard because,
as opposed to the Veterans of Foreign
Wars and other veterans associations
he belongs to, all the members of Pitt
Vets are about the same age and were in

hope it stays

a bunch of vets

getting together, talking ‘to each other
and getting to know each other.”

5 Marco Attisano

to set up Pitt Vets.‘ The group had a few
meetings at the end of last year and ex-
pects to get into full swing this semes-
ter.

According to Hannan, a group like
Pitt Vets not only helps soldiers re-in-'
tegrate into civil society, but also helps
them battle any lingering effects of
combat.

In reference to post—traumatic stress
disorder and depression, common men-
tal stresses for soldiers, Hannan said
that on one’s own, “things can get ugly

the same ﬁght. _ 5

Pitt Vets also endeavors to become
a voice for student veterans on issues
that affect them. Cole mentioned" a
desire to see the University institute
priority registration for veterans, and
Dave Coogan, the club’s vice president
who spent five years as an intelligence
officer in the Marines, said he would
like to use the gro_up as a mouthpiece to
bring attention to the fact that the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs is late
on its GI Bill payments this year.

 

But without specific plans to tackle
these issues, it’s apparent that the na-
scent organization is still trying to get
its feet in the political arena.

“We’re a new group still ﬁnding out
what the issues are,” Coogan said. ,

Some members also hope that the
group will make the presence of veter-
ans more visible for other students at
Pitt.‘ According; to Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Vet-
erans Services, there are 521,registered
veterans at Pitt, which makes up about
2 percent of the undergraduate student
body.

“We are one of the most invisible
minorities on campus,”, said Marco At-
tisano, Pitt Vets director of policy and
government affairs.

Attisano said that because all ﬁght-
ing was voluntary in the Iraq and Af-
ghanistan conflicts, he believes that
‘much of the population is culturally

1 removed from those two wars and the

people they affected.

“If the group becomes visible on
campus, it could make a lot of students
stop and think,” Attisano said.

The members of Pitt Vets have grand .

plans, but they seem content meeting in
a bar drinking beers, eating pizza and
talking about old times -- for now.

_ “I hope it stays a bunch of vets get—.

ting together, talking to each other and
getting to know each other,” Attisano
said loudly over the crowd as he reﬁlled
his beer at Mario’s. “Whatever this
group becomes, I hope this stays.” -

VOTER ID a

Pushinsky said his father passed away
last April.

The library hosted the community meet:
ing on behalf of the ACLU to inform voters
about the law. If the law is upheld,_voters
must have photo ID with an expiration date
in order to cast their votes.

Poll workers will accept Pennsylvania
driver’s licenses, passports, Pennsylvania

_ resident identiﬁcations, military identiﬁca-

tions with an expiration date or whose expi-
ration date is listed as indeﬁnite, state and
municipal employee identiﬁcations, iden-
tiﬁcations issued by. licensed care facilities
and identiﬁcations issued by Pennsylvania
institutions of higher learning — meaning
Pitt IDs will qualify as valid identiﬁcation.
IDs that have expired and both trade and V0-
cational school IDs will not be accepted.
Mark Hudson, the Monroeville Public Li-
brary’s head of adult services said that he or-

ganized the event after the ACLU contacted,

the library.

“The more information people have
about this law, the better they can deal with
obstacles that may be placed in their way,”
Hudson said.

Prospective voters who lack such forms
of identiﬁcation will be able to receive an
identiﬁcation card for voting purposes by
presenting a social security card, a birth
certiﬁcate, a certiﬁcate of naturalization or a
certiﬁcate of citizenship at one of the Penn-

sylvania Department of Transportation’s
license centers.- The centers also require
proof of residence.

Pushinsky believes the Thursday hear-
ing before the Supreme Court promises to
be close. Because Justice Joan Orie Melvin
was removed from the bench after being in-
dicted on ethics violations, only six judges
will hear the case, instead of the usual seven.
They will be evenly divided between Demo-
crats and Republicans, which makes it hard
to predict whether the ACLU’s lawsuit can
win the majority required to overturn the
law.

None of those in attendance at the li-
brary spoke in support of the law, and most
expressed concerns about the difficulties
that they or others could face in obtaining
the proper identiﬁcation.

Marylyn Devlin, 61, a Pitt graduate, drew
a parallel between the new law and the poll
taxes and literacy-tests that existed in some
states before the United States Supreme
Court declared them unconstitutional.

“I think it’s un—American to deny people
the right to vote,” Devlin, a retired elemen-
tary school teacher, said.

Devlin believes that the law will do just
that and that it aims in particular at prevent-
ing poorer voters, who historically favor

Democratic candidates, from voting in the =

upcoming election.

’ Hudson believed the ACLU’s event
would help to inform members. Although
he stressed that as a librarian, he had to
maintain his objectivity while providing the
public with information, he views the law as

“un—Democratic.”

He believes that the event provided in-
formation to the community that would
prove useﬁil to potential voters who lack the
proper identiﬁcation.

Ngani Ndimbie, 25, a community orga-
niier for the ACLU, was also present at the
event to distribute informational litera-

ture and answer questions on behalf of the
Union.

She said that she still hoped for a victory
for the ACLU on Thursday, saying that she
felt the organization’s case was strong.

“I don’t think there is any way for this law
to be enforced the way it is written and not

— infringe on the rights of voters,” she said. ﬁ

GOING MENTAL

Why choo

Tracey» Hickey
Columnist

Something really frightening hap-
pened yesterday when’I looked in
the mirror.

In fact, it’s been happening for
weeks. More often than not, for

almost a month now, I’ve looked,

in the mirror and felt  basically
alright about what I saw.

Getting comfortable with my
own appearance is something
I’ve been working toward, with
no small amount of struggle, for
years. And now that I seem to be
arriving at my goal, the emotion
I feel is less triumph than fear.
Where do I get off feeling good
about how I look? Who gave me
permission to go around think-
ing I’m some sort of hot property?
What kind of conceited jerk am I
turning into?

As an adult, hating yourself is a
choice. That doesn’t mean I think
you can snap out of it just like that;
drinking is still a choice if you’re
an alcoholic, but I don’t believe it’s
fair to expect an addict to just wake
up one morning and stop drink-
ing without any qualiﬁed help and

SC t0

positive self-esteem:

support. Staying in an abusive rela-
tionship is a choice, but with things
like children’s safety or the abil-
ity to pay the rent on the line, it’s
hardly as simple as “Why don’t you
just leave?”

Self-loathing is a choice that I,
in particular, continued to make
for most of my life, and stopped
making only very’ recently. And
now that I’ve broken the cycle, I
can see a lot of the reasons I made
that choice.

Despite the best efforts of
Oprah’s 0 magazine to tell people
otherwise, being proud of yourself
is not cool. Many girls, like me,
probably have memories of realiz-
ing around sixth or seventh grade
that constantly putting yourself
down is one of the most crucial
norms of girl culture, and that
anyone who deviates from it will
stick out like a sore thumb. This is
middle school we’re talking about;
if you stick out, especially in a way
that leads people to think of you

as conceited, you are going to be.

quickly and brutally cut down.
When middle school ends and

'self—deprecating behavior ceases

to be rewarded socially, it persists

dislike yourself?  

as a superstitious behavior. Even
the Bible teaches that those who
humble themselves will be exalted,
and those who exalt themselves
will be humbled. Jesus wasn’t
preaching the virtue of the inferi-
ority complex, yet his words echo
the self-denigrating superstition
I know too well. It goes like this:
If I believe that I am not worthy,
perhaps the world will ﬁnd a way
to prove to me that I am; but if I
believe I am worthy, the universe
will surely and swiftly prove to me
how mistaken I was.

We all know how believing that
you aren’t competent or lovable
can be a self—fulﬁlling prophecy
that harms your career and rela-
tionships, but this pill seems some-
how easier to swallow: If you’re
going to fail, at least it won’t catch
you by surprise.

This superstition is intensely
diﬁicult to shake. I still feel some-
times that if I go around honestly,
unapologeftically thinking I’m in-
telligent and capable, all the grad
schools will reject me just to prove
me wrong; if I start to ﬁnd myself

COLUMN

NASA embraces opportu

J onathan Fischer
Columnist

Sometimes it’s not the actual outcome of
an action that’s important, but the inten-
tion behind it that serves a greater pur-
pose. 1
While it’s unlikely that extraterrestrial
life forms heard rapper Will.i.am’s new
single, “Reach for the Stars,” from the
Curiosity rover -— which acted as a $2.5
billion radio station as it streamed data of

the fo_ur-minute-and-24-second song on "

Mars in late August —- the intention be-
hind NASA’s choice to play music in outer
space means more than just a publicity
stunt or potentially baiting aliens to invade
Earth. This rover—as-iPod stunt seemed

humorous or outlandish to most — let’s ,

face it, we were all a bit astonished that
NASA had dipped into the entertainment
industry. ' .

But maybe this is exactly what NASA
needed to promote both itself and space

V exploration.

NASA is ensuring its future by targeting
a younger audience, and it’s easy to see
why. As a government-funded program
that is under close public scrutiny, its bud-
get tends to ﬂuctuate with public opinion.
During the mid- to late 1960s, NASA’s

I 4

budget was at its highest: 4.41 percent of
the U.S. budget..The United States had
accomplished a moon landing, and pub-
lic opinion was at an all-time high. But
throughout the 1970s, starting with the
near-disaster of Apollo 13, the budget
gradually declined,

2008, the space agency beamed The Bea-
tles’ “Across the Universe” into space to

' commemorate the 40th anniversary of the

song’s recording. While the event made the
news, it certainly didn’t garner the public
attention that “Reach for the Stars” did.

NASA had .a unique

dropping to 1 per-
cent by the ’90s. As
it currently stands,
the budget com-
mands a measly
0.5 percent of the
federal budget. In
fact, it’s so measly
that in 2009, ac-
cording to the IRS,
if your adjusted
gross income was
less than $50,000,
you. paid less than
$9 to NASA.

- it’s easy to see
the reasoning
behind NASA’s,

musical   intentions

-- to -gather public
  interest 

opportunity to ride
the wave of its suc-
- cessful landing of
Curiosity and utilize
some of Will.i.arr'i’s
star power.
The selection of
v Will.i.am to repre-
sent NASA initially
seemed, strange.
After all, wouldn’t
a song like Elton
John’s “Rocket Man”
be a bit more uni-
versally recogniz-

'It’s easy to see
the reasoning be-
hind NASA’s musical intentions —- to
gather public interest and continue to add
to its recent successful missions. It se_ems
the association hopes such activity will
directly impact its budget.

However, this is not the ﬁrst time NASA
has sent music deep into the cosmos. In

able?

But in addition to
using the rapper’s current popularity to
gain public support, perhaps NASA wanted

v to align itself with Will.i.am’s own advo- _

cacy of early education. ' . .
The musician, who promotes science
and mathematics education through his

own i.am.angel foundation, announced at

nity for a musical mission

the song—transmission event a $10 million
classroom-education initiative that will
reach 25 million students annually, includ-
ing many from under—served communities.

“It is my new mission now,” Will.i.am
said, “to use music, to use my career, to
inspire this youth in America.” Whether or
not you are a fan of his music, he’s helping
NASA draw attention to math and science
education, which is deﬁnitely in line with
NASA’s goals. '

As a child, I was always infatuated with
space. I remember eyeing NASA’s Glenn
Research Center many times as I departed
from Cleveland Hopkins International Air-
port. It was a ﬁtting thing to view from
the cabin window as I ascended toward
the sky. A

I wouldn’t say that my enthusiasm died,
but as I grew up, any hope to see life be-
yond the earth seemed unfathomable, and
it was easy to lose interest.in space. Now
along comes NASA, pulling off a trivial
mission to reinvigorate my interest and
hopefully that of others as well.

I’m now curious as to what the space
agency’s future plans may be, and'I think
that’s exactly what NASA would like to
hear.

physically attractive, my boyfriend will run
off with someone better-looking.

And ﬁnally, when we’ve accepted the ﬁc-
tion of our worthlessness for long enough,
we start to make ridiculous leaps of logic to
hang onto it, not because we want to hang
onto our inferiority complexes -—— no one
really does — but because when you come to
believe something to be intrinsic and immu-
table truth, you start to screen out or pervert
data that doesn’t agree with it. If you believe
it as intrinsically and immutably true that

" homosexuality is wrong and gay people are

deeply dysfunctional, you’re not going to be
open to the evidence showing that children

who grow up with gay parents are no worse
off than children who grow up with straight
parents. Likewise, if you believe it as intrinsi-
cally and immutably true that you have noth-
ing going for you, winning the Nobel Peace
Prize wouldn’t convince you otherwise — no
matter what you’d done to earn it, you’d feel
even guiltier for having “stolen” the award
from someone more deserving.

When I discussed this column with a
friend from high school, he expressed his
conﬂict as trying to convince himself that
he should feel good about himself when it’s
“objectively true” that he shouldn’t. “There

isn’t really one measure that validates that .

belief,” he lamented — “that belief” being
the simple self—affirmation that he is a decent
guy with a lot to be proud of.

I was surprised to hear that, not because I

was under the impression that my friend was
conﬁdent, but because I know he was raised
to put way too much stock in the Magic In-.
visible Success-O-Meter that tallies up your

accomplishments to determine whether or '

not you’re a valuable human being by arbi-
trary standards. '

This guy —- as I then reminded him,
gently and with two highly raised eyebrows

- — has two things most people consider to

be worth a lot of points on the Success-O-
Meter: an Ivy League degree and a job in his
ﬁeld. Those are, two things that I don’t have
— one of which I’ almost deﬁnitely never
will —- and yet my friend seems to think that
I’m doing pretty well with my life while he
isn’t. This is because the Success-O-Meter,
and the standards we create to ensure that

we’re always scoring lower than we think

other people are scoring, are utterly imper-
vious to reason.

Many of us resist change, no matter how
positive, and for some reason few changes
are as terrifying as letting go of the cold,
prickly security blanket that is hating every-

. thing about yourself. During the ﬁrst stage of

the transition you won’t know you’re making,
you will probably hate yourself for starting
to like yourself, adding “secretly conceited”
to your never-ending list of ﬂaws. But when
you ﬁnally emerge on the other side, you will
look back at the wild—eyed determination
with which you clung to the manufactured
certainties that made the last few years of
your life so miserable, and it will rival your
worst ex-boyfriend in terms of things you
should have let go a long time ago.

Two twin boys lie on a blanket with their
mother, playing with toys and eating
snacks from the concession stand. As
the sun begins to set, many rows in the
open lot ﬁll up with cars all facing a large

_ SCYECII.

It’s a Friday night at Moon Township’s
Dependable Drive In, and for the Bobish

family, the only thing better than a night '

at the drive-in theater would be more op-
portunities to come.

“I wish that there were more of them,
thatxthey would have more screens,” said
Brittney Bobish, a 27-year-old resident
of Aliquippa.

This four—screen drive-in has been in
business for the last 62 years, and is one
of the few original drive-ins that still ex-
ist today. Spanning 24 acres, Dependable
Drive In can ﬁt up to 500 cars. It is one
of the 368 remaining drive-in theaters in

the U.S., and one of 33 in Pennsylvania,
according to the United Drive—In Theatre
Owners Association, a group dedicated
to keeping drive-ins a competitive sector
of the motion picture industry.

Though not entirely depleted, the
drive-in theater industry has suffered
a signiﬁcant number of closures. Com-
pared to the industry’s pinnacle year, the
number of drive-in theaters in the nation
has severely declined. The first drive-in
theater in the U.S. opened in 1933 in New
Jersey. In 1958, there were 4,063 drive-
ins scattered throughout the country.
Today, it’s easy to see why drive-ins are
thought_of as an endangered species in
the cinematic ecosystem.

On average, a handful of drive-ins
close every year but not many open or
reopen. While the numbers rarely in-
crease, there is evidence that more peo-
ple are going to drive-ins for their movie
experiences.

“When we were young, I had a mar-
velous date [with my wife] at the drive-
in, and I’ll never forget it. If I were still
married, I’d still go,” said Jerry Wurzer, a

...e.myan:a,ava..essm..;..aan 

70-year-old resident of the North Hills.
Wurzer, who was with his grandchildren
at Twin Hi-Way Drive—In in Robinson,
reminisced about what he liked most
about the drive-in, even indulging in a
couple of tales from the back seat.

“The drive-in meant something
back then. We took our dates because
we could sit under the stars_and have a
lovely evening in addition to the movie.
It wasn’t always about rounding another
base,” Wurzer said. , .

And though romance isn’t always an
added incentive for the drive-in, there
is one thing that many customers ﬁnd
pleasing: the prices.

Unlike a typical movie theater, drive-
ins offer two movies for one price, which
is usually around $10. Screens generally
offer two screenings back—to-back that
feature different movies. Movie-goers
can sit through two ﬁlms, a bonus for the
outdoor venues.

For Bobish, the back-to-back ﬁlms
make going to the drive-in even more
beneﬁcial.

“I love being outside. I think it’s bet-

ter than being inside. I like to get two
movies, and it’s cheaper,” Bobish said.
Bobish brings her 9-year-old twin

sons, Dixon and Hank, to Dependable -

Drive In every year for the outdoor mov-
ie experience. Though she and her two
boys grew up after the peak of drive-ins,
the family still enjoys the industry, espe-
cially with its low prices.

“They love the. drive—in,” she said.

Bobish brought her sons to Dependable
Drive In to see “Diary of a Wimpy Kid,”
and as the twins sprawled out on their
blanket, they watched the screen come
to life at the outdoor movie event.

' Casey Dunleavy, a senior at Clarion
University, also makes frequent trips to
Dependable Drive In during his summers
and holidays at. home in Peters Town-
ship. He takes with him nothing less
than a fully-stocked cooler, a frisbee and
a handful of friends. “You can bring your
own food or beer if you’re discreet, and
you get to see two movies for less than

$10. You can’t get that anywhere else,”"

Dunleavy said.

A Dunleavy, who_ has been a customer
of Dependable Drive In since the age of
10, admits that he first started going to
the drive-in theater with hislfamily of
sevento save money. Considering that
admission is only $6.50 per person for a
double feature, it’s not hard to see why.
Comparatively, a single feature at a mul-
tiplex cinema costs $10.

tending to be.

At Dependable, Glaus works to main-
tain the equipment’s high technological
standards.

“We take a lot of pride in this. Any
time any new technology has been avail-
able, we’ve grabbed it up almost instan-
taneously, almost as soon as it comes
out,” he said.

In order to create an atmosphere that ’

replicates an indoor movie theater, Glaus

attempts to keep high standards
“We try to keep it pretty close to an
indoor. I mean, you’ll never get it en-
tirely to an indoor,

proﬁts come from
concession stand
funds, because
ticket revenue is
often paid back to
movie studios as
“rent” for showing
the‘ ﬁlms, accord-
ing to the board of
the United Drive-
In Theatre Owners
Association.

Jay Glaus, the
19-year-old man-
ager at Dependable
Drive In, said De-
pendable ‘doesn’t

because you have
the moon and you
got the outside
lights, but we’re re-
ally competitively

Bobish agrees.
“With every-
one’s radio blast-
ing, it pretty much

sounds like sur-
round sound,” she
said.

atre, still uses the

able Drive In offers movie-goers options
such as the “dollar dog,” while Twin Hi-

Way has affordable funnel cakes and

whole pizzas for their guests.

’ But even successful drive—ins con-
tinue to have a hard time staying open,
with the pressure to update technology
to digital entertainment. It’s often more
economical to continue to use outdated
technology, which in its own way adds
to the nostalgia of the drive-in theater.

.The FM radio signal is usually weak, the

projectionis crooked, the screen crack-
les and headlights wash out the picture
as people turn on their cars. The drive-in

with for the last 50 years.

The new equipment will cost more
than $175,000, but even if it seems that
drive—ins are on their way out, Vogel
seems to think it’s worth it.

“There is something so special about
sunset to me. That moment before twi-
light. That even when I am not operating,
I will look at that screen and my heart
pines to put light up there,” Vogel said.

nation enslaved as corporate tools.”

d If you want to make a change in Wash-

ington, you need to have the capital to do so.
And if you have the capital to do so, you need
to push the pennies into the right pockets.
According to 0pensecrets.org, $1.64 bil-
lion was spent on lobbying efforts in 2001,

‘_ land $3.33 billion was spent in 2011. During
that same 10 years, the number of lobbyists
in the country ﬂuctuated between 11,000 A

and 14,000.

But if political pull isn’t your shtick,
maybe you want to make America better by
_spreading your message in the American

music industry. Five Finger Death Ptmch, a
band out of California, teaches aspiring art-
ists to make friends with a super-big record
company with _a lot of money and marketing
know—how.

The band likes the concept so much that
its last release is entitled American Capi-
talist. The album takes a meta look at the
American capitalist system and the ways in
which people proﬁt within it.

The members of Five Finger Death Punch
don’t seem to take any shame in the concept
of capitalism— either — and instead wrote
a song directed at all of the anti-establish-
ment hipsters.

The band’s song “The Pride” begins by.

rattling off American icons such as “Johnny
Cash and PBR,/ Jack Daniels, NASCAR,/

18th Annual

Facebook, Myspace,_/ iPod, Bill Gates,/
Smith and Wesson, NRA,” all of which rep-
resent various components of U.S. culture.
In America, selling a product or idea is
all about exposure. And how do you get ex-
posure, you ask‘? Well, you have to have the
money to market,
FFDP defends the practice by claiming
that it’s “not selling out, [it’s] buying in.”
And if _we Americans are buying into the
liquid market of the business sector, why
not buy into the court system, too? Listen
to Metallica’s 1988 album ...And]ustice For
All, and you’ll be hit with an hour of tracks
that revolve around the theme of “truth,” or
a lack thereof. .

. So, in the words of Metallica, if you want
to win a court case‘ in America today, you
need to have a lawyer who knows what to
say and when to say it. And for that, you
have to pay the price.

The song continues to claim that par-
ticipants within the system are “seeking no
truth,” and instead hold a “winning is all”
mindset. With that being said, lead singer
James Hetﬁeld “ﬁn'd[s] it so griml so true/
so real.” '

So real, in fact, that Metallica used the
same system it criticized in 1988 to take
down Napster, a company that released the
band’s music for free without consent or ret-
ribution, about 12 years later.

And if we are going to talk about retribu-
tion, why not talk about war and peace in the
land of the free and the home of the brave?

Ever since the U.S. gained its indepen-
dence after the Revolutionary War, the
country has engaged in its share of mili-
tary interventions and conﬂicts. And where
there is war, there is money to be made.

According to a 2012 article in The Na-
tion, Washington’s defense budget for 2013
is upwards of $931 billion.

And with the military industrial complex

in mind, Megadeth founder Dave Mustaine .

titled the band’s 1986 album Peace Sells
 But Who’s Buying? The album features a
track named “Peace Sells”, in which listen-
ers can ﬁnd ﬁirther rhetorical questions,
such as “Can you put a price on peace?” and
“It’s still ‘We the people,’ right?”

But yes, Dave, it is still “Wethe people.”
We Americans still have the privilege to vote
—— both at the ballots and with our wallets
— and we still have the freedom of expres-
sion that enables these metallers to speak
openly about, and against, this ﬁne country.

And despite all the criticism and con-
demnation purported by these_artists, we
can still claim these metalheads as our fel-
low patriots.

Because a wise man by the name of
Thomas Jefferson once wrote: “Dissent is
the highest form of patriotism.” I

The Pitt men’s soccer team had
quite a weekend. ' I

The Panthers (3—0—2) remain
undefeated after defeating the
Indiana University-Purdue Uni-

and the Delaware Blue Hens to
clinch the Pitt/Nike Invitational

Junior forward Nico Wrobel
led Pitt all weekend, scoring
three of the team’s four goals.
His contributions were recog-
nized by the Big East when he_
was named the conference’s Of-

Tuesday.

“Nico’s like a robot out

The junior forward, whom Pitt '

men’s soccer head coach Joe Lux-
bacher described as a “robot” from
the penalty spot, easily converted
two penalty kicks against IPFW
Friday night as Pitt won 3-1. Wro-
bel followed that up by scoring the
game’s only goal in the Panthers’
success versus the Blue Hens.

Wrobel’s impressive weekend
earned him Big East Offensive Play-

In the first half, the Mast-
odons dictated play, but they
didn’t take the lead until the
early minutes of the second
half, when IPFW defenseman
Brent Helton received a pass
from teammate Mitch Falken~
stern and.buried a shot into
the back of the net.

The’ Panthers responded
instantly by playing, argu-
ably, their best soccer of the
season, scoring three times in
a 20-minute span.

Pitt sophomore Cory Werth
entered the opponent’s box
and was fouled, and Wrobel
slotted home the penalty kick
to level the score.

j7Minutes later, Wrobel
scored his second goal of the
game as the junior forward
converted another penalty
kick following a hand ball foul
against IPFW.

It didn’t take long for the
Panthers to strike again.

A rebound following a long
throw fell to the feet of Pitt

  

sophomore Michael Tuohy, .

who poked the ball into the
net to ensure the victory for
the Panthers.

  

“It was a great long throw

“They were moving the ball
around extremely well today,’
and without Lee, we probably
don’t win this kind of game,”
Walbert said after the win
against Delaware. “He is a
freak, and one of the biggest
assets we have.”

After posting a .923 save
percentage and making 12
saves this weekend,]ohnston
was named tournament MVP.

“They gave us a really tough
time today, but our defense
really stepped up,” Johnston
said. “Last year, this is the

and Alexa Campbell, Acton was also named
to the all-tournament team as the Panthers
stretched their winning streak to seven
games.

Rens, in his ﬁfth season as the head coach
of the Pitt volleyball team, has his young
team playing with conﬁdence, which is
impressive considering that the team cur-
rently has 12 underclassmen, compared to
just seven upperclassmen.

The Pitt volleyball team will begin its
Big East play at Seton Hall on Sept. 22, and
if Rens’ Panthers continue to improve, they
should qualify for a ﬁfth consecutive trip to
the Big East tournament after the regular
season. I
