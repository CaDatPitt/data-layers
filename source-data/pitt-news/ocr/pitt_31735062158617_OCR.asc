Wherein We Look
At Parapsychology,
‘Extra’ Perception

By ROBERT BROVVN

The only safe way for the
layman to look at the suddenly
popular mental telepathy ex-
periments is an open-minded
one, shading on doubt.

All the best psychologists,
excluding Dr. J. B. Rhine of
Duke university, are perfectly
willing to be convinced of the
existence of prophesy, tele-
pathy, or clairvoyance, but
they are going to be awfully stub-
born about it. A

Dr. Rhine is the reason for the
renewed interest in a phase of
parapsychology that has intrigued
mankind since the days of Moses
and Merlin. Countless 0. Henry-
like heroines have been saved by
telepathy, and believe-it-or-not
programs have traded it on the
supposition.

Expressing belief that extra-
sensory perception is more than
just a “metaphysical spook chase,”
Dr. Oliver L. Reiser, associate
professor of philosophy, summar-
ized recent developments in this
ﬁeld at Friday’s meetinggof SFA’s
Student—Faculty Forum.‘ A H I l '

Two In Telepathy

“So far in Dr. Rhine’s experi-
mental work at Duke University,
results of telepathy and clairvoy-
ance tests with symbol cards seem-
ingly prove that extra sensory per-
ception is much more than a fad,”
Dr. Reiser said. “Scientiﬁc meth-
ods are in use, with statistical
methods clearly worked out.”

In telepathy experiments, two
people are used. One participant
looks at a card with a certain sym-
bol on it, and by concentrating
heavily on it, attempts to transmit
the sensory impression to the sec-
ond participant, who may be only
a few yards away or many hun-
dreds of miles. Results indicate
that distance has relatively little
importance. ’

“The above fact punctures the
theory of certain psychologists who
have worked out explanations of
the phenomena by stating that it
is a question of brain wave trans-
mission,” Dr. Reiser declared.
“Ordinarily, by mathematical laws,
waves tend to become weaker as
they travel farther. from their
source. However, because the
participants make as good scores
far apart from each other as they
do at close range, this theory will
not do, according to Dr. Rhine.”

No Other Technique

So far, little attempt has been
made at trying out telepathy
through other techniques than the
card system. The reason is that
Dr. Rhine, who has worked out
his theories over a period of eight
years, wishes to be sure that the
scientiﬁc methods used are work-
ing correctly_ before he attempts
other experiments. ‘

“Not everyone has the faculty of
being able to use the two methods,”
explained Dr. Reiser. “On an aver-
age, only one out of ﬁve persons
consistently can make higher
scores than chance would allow.
Also, an element of cooperation is
needed. In this respect, it is ob-
served that participants can vol-
untarily lowcr their scores.”

In his summary, Dr. Reiser said
that it is yet too soon to take every-
thing in extra-sensory perception
for granted, even though docu-
mentary evidence would seem to
support its credence. More com-
plete statistical evidence will be
needed, and different techniques
will have to be used before men-
tal telepathy will be classed as a
science, along with psychology and
its allied subjects.

Persian Investigates
Teaching Methods
For Doctor’s Degree

Representing the Iranian gov-
ernment, Mehdi J alali, 28-year-old
Persian student, is working for his
doctor’s degree in the University
Graduate School.

September of this year he en-
tered the Graduate School, in
which he is carrying 15 credits
and doing research work for his
dissertation, “Education in Iran
and Some Suggestions for Its Bet-
terment.” He has already passed
his preliminary examination for
doctor's degree in education.

After graduating from the Ecole
Normal . .Supe,17i.or in . the. city of
Tehran in 1933, Jalali earned a

A
scholarship by. receiving ﬁrst

ranking in a competitive examin-
ation given by the Iranian gov-
ernment. The scholarship was of-
fered because the ministry of ed-
ucation realized the need of send-
ing a Persian student abroad to
study the American educational
system.

Jalali entered Washington and
Jefferson college in January, 1934.
In a year’s time he had mastered
the English language. He entered
teacher’s college at Columbia Uni-
versity, where he received his
mas ’s degree in 1936. This
spriﬁj he received a professional
diploma from the Columbia school
of psychology.

Mr. Jalali believes that Amer-

to revive their dormant organiza-
tion or join forces with the En-
gineering Association.

A Leaders‘Feted
  At Campaign
Banquet

By SIDNEY snonn

Today, the Commons Room was
again a high-vaulted study room.
Friday, it was a banquet-hall
echoing to pleas for the under-
privileged of Pittsburgh.

Friday evening, leaders in the
annual Community Fund drive
met to discuss plans, to listen to
a program of prominent speakers,
and to eat.

Behind the scenes was F. S. Mc-
Clements of the Joyce-McClem-
ents caterers. Mr. Mcclements was
marshalling a crew of 75 waiters,
10 chefs, 20 assistant chefs, and
30 dishwashers. This company
was installed in the back portion
of the ﬁrst floor where the Uni-
versity had constructed kitchens
which the caterer called “ﬁne
enough for any hotel.”

I In the 45 minutes necessary for
'serving 1,000 guests, there were
consumed: 500 grapefruit; 500 ﬁsh,
ﬁlet of solo; 65 pounds of butter;
4,000 rolls; 35 bushels of potatoes;
80 pounds of coffee; 10 gallons of
cream; and 150 Boston cream pies.

Our staff statistician computed
that each waiter had charge of
13 1-3 persons; that 22.2 guests
were served per minute; that each
person received his entire meal, if
he wanted it all at once, in 3 3-8
minutes; or that 3 3-8 waiters
served one person in one minute.

“The student of today wishes to 7

the value of peace discussions.
Most students are frankly pessim-

“But primarily this meeting
should be merely one step in a
peace program, backed by inter-

real meaning of present peace
crises.”

Rackoff To Preview
» Wednesday’s Paper
In Talk Tomorrow

Tuesday night KQV listeners
have been ﬁnding out University
News before University students

have been able to read about it.
All because Herbert Rackoff, C38,
managing editor of The News, is
also the “Voice of Pitt.”

Tomorrow night at 8 o’clock, a
series listed as “Intercollegiate
News and Views” will broadcast
its third program. In addition to
‘Rackoff, other school newscasters
are Harry Scoffield, drama senior
at Carnegie Institute of Technol-
ogy; and Frank Gill, sports editor
of The Duquesne Duke.

The local managing editor, after
correcting proofs on Wednesday’s
paper, scoops his own publication

by broadcasting the newsthe stu-
dents read the next morning.

The half—hour program is con-
ducted by Ernie Neif, announcer
for the Chamber of Commerce
building station.

Rackoff claims he experienced
no “mike” fright” in his initial
appearance before any micro-
phone. Unfortunately, he also
experienced no audience. This
University Diogenes is still look-
ing for a listener who also agrees
with him.

In addition to all this, Rackoff
authors his own script, including
directions for the announcer to
chuckle, snort, and ask leading
questions. Nevertheless, the
“Voice of Pitt” not only asks stu-
dents to tune in but even requests
fan mail. .

Mr. Rackoff is on for ten long

_ TUDENT response to \V’asseri_nann‘ tests ad-'

ministered by Student Health Ser_vi'ces._.at‘
the‘U:nive‘rsity has been excellent.’ It lS,f‘€llI-’
couragiiig to ﬁnd that the student b0Cl_f\'%-Ofliéll
referred to as “the unknown " ';qua.'ntl:ty:”‘;’ is
willing and ready to respond to .the ca'1iiip-ai'g‘n
by invitatioii only. ’  A“-*“
This iiivitation, extended by tl1e—Pittsburgli
health department laboratories, the Health
Services, and The Pitt News, was enlarged last
week to include faculty inembei-‘s at? the‘ Uni-
versity. Faculty members, we had thought,
were less of an “unknown quantity,” would
better understand and, consequently, better
respond to the appeal of a campaign -whose
basis is educational. I  I I '
According to ﬁgures at hand, of the few
Vfaculty people who have taken the‘7 tests, ‘the,
list includes an encouraging number of we-
men professors. Among the men, the only
response has be-en from four persons—which

includes those men who have been in charge ,
of administering the examinations. _

Campaigns are satisfactory only when there
is a.'d‘eﬁnite need for the program attempted;
we stand undisputed: there is a need.

’Campaigns are satisfactory only when an
adequate _,response is made: that response has
been made by the student body.

:-But from the facultvy——those people whom
we believe would most be interested in leading
a- deﬁnite educational niove——-the response has
been negligible.

We repeat our invitation for both students
and faculty to participate and add again that
the program of free tests will end Wednesday.

Will Pitt Win---You’ll
Have T oAsk Waddell

R. VVADDELL, defeated Republican may-
oralty. candidate, will speak on campus
Friday. He will, no doubt, have a better at-
tendance than-he might have attracted had he
attended,~~after he had accepted, the mayoralty.
debate two short weeks ago, for all classes at
the University will be dismissed to hear him.

Per'haps‘he held out for a larger attendance.

Mr. \Vaddel1 will be featured at the ﬁrst and
only pep rally scheduled to rally the students
and pep up the ﬁghting Panthers-—and this in
preparation for the Nebraska, cornhusking.
’Which may be good, considering all things.

Like the departed Mr. Klemperer, Mr. "Wad-
»dell uses no podium, will have no opporunity
.during~tlie next four years to wield the “big
baton.” He will spend his time in contem-
plation.

A At present writing we are doing the same.
“Te considerrthe past: Mr. Waddell can have
been chosen for several reasons. First, he was
once a coach himself, mentor of the Tech Tar-
tans. Or, second, he is a prominent Pitts-
burgher. Or, third, the slogan of the self-
styled “man of the people” is “VVin With
Waddell.” .

To be sure, Mr. “Taddell will be called upon
to answer no refutation this time. He will, no
doubt, keep the» date open. He will stand un-
challenged. - '

American Student Union

Meets Somewhere Today

AMERICAN STUDENT UNION’S local
chapter will meet today to elect new of-
ﬁcers and formulate plans for the year. The
meeting called, according to the chairman of
the group ’s executive committee, will serve to
demonstrate the fact that ASU at the Univer-
sity is neither still-born nor paralyzed.

The meeting today will attempt to accom-
plish a inimber of things. Primary purpose
should be to outline deﬁnitely plans and by-
plans of the organization, then to release its
plans to students at the University.

The organization, never granted a charter,
is assumed by many of the labeled conserva-
‘ tives and reactionaries on campus to be radical.
As yet the organizationhas had no opportu-
nity to prove» or disprove that charge. 

I We have always" ﬁrmly believed that ASU

* can ‘be of‘_advant.age to the University, and Uni-

versity people if it can".:.accomplish.its .3/1-,111S.. If

it can do this, it will receive the support of all
elenientsof the student body. ,
At any rate, we believe that the organiza-
tion should be given the opportunity to stand
onits feet, to have its say. If it is of demo-

their support, if not, it will cease to exist.
The . stude’n~ts—-to whom the University
should cater-—.are .the life-blood of any stu-
dent organization," which is like saying
“what. is, is.’—’ . _ . .

With ASU striking the gavel for the first
time this year today,‘ it is of interest to note-
that’ the: session will be held at 315 South
Bellefield rather than 315 Cathedral of
Learning. - v .

God ‘Again Saves

The Constitution

SADDEST commentary on our political think-
ing as shown by the_recent-voting was. the

gloating statement by one of our newspapers

that “Pennsylvania ’s 63-year-old constitution

_;apparciit.ly withstood another assault at the
polls,” , ,

Aincndments defeated wer-e-:

«state to ‘levy an income tax to helprelieve the
burden on real estate and modernize’ the state’s

; "taxing policy in“ line -with the- ability to pay.

' Abolition of constitutional prohibition on-the

“..intro'd11.S3t..l‘0n‘.i of amendments so that new‘ pro-

posals couldrbe made at any time-instead of
'oi1-ly"fat five-year intervals. ’ — —

Coi1solidati_oii ‘of Philadelphia ’s city and
county gf::C»)q’tF_€3_I'l1lTl'ell‘l.S, which cover the same
-area. This would have made a necessary cen-
tralization "of administration and saved thou-
sands of-dollars by doing away with needless
duplication of offices. ,'
A Creation of a county utilities authority, in-
tended to affect reduction of utility rates and
better service. _

Perhaps Pennsylvanians are proud of the
factthat -what was good enough 63 years ago
is goodenough for them today, in spite of an
unprecedented increase and change in our
econom_ic'structure and the functions of the
state.   ‘

Perhaps the majority of them are still

. wearing long red underwear_.‘rea.ding by the
light of ‘kerosene lamps, driving buggies over,
dirt roads, and asking nothing from_g0vern-

- ment but the chasing of offenders of the law.-

We think not. They are just afraid-
afraid of any change, any break in tradition,
anything diﬂferent from what they have
known and done for years, any progress.

Americans laugh at the ancestor worship of
the Chinese. But verily, we are just as much
governed by the bones of our fo-refat-hers.

The world moves, even if Pennsylvania does
not. 12 ‘~ o _

Calamity, Dear:
By Irene rLo,ng

Will you explain ‘the Nine-Power Conference.
When and where does it meet?
—IRRESOLUTION.

DEAR IRRESOLUTION:
It is in the beautiful city of Brussels, Belgium,

. that the Nine Power Conference met last Wednes-

day. Brussels is a lovely place;-but it smells . -. .
and so does the Nine Power Conference.

There is a whiff of decaying resolution, a sultry
atmosphere of dead honor and dying decency, a.
mingling of corpses and skunks about that confer-
ence. I

It was sixteen years ago that the Nine Powers
met for the first time in Washington. A treaty was
drawn up guaranteeing the “independence and ter-
ritorial integrity of China.” -Yep! And the sig-
natures of delegates of the United States, Japan, the
British Commonwealth, China, Italy, France, the
Netherlands, Belgium, and ha-ha they chuckled,
Portugal! appeared on the document.

And the Conference meets again today--with
little promise of honesty and square dealing. They
meet to pass the buck once more. In_ Washington
the famed Fireside Chats no more bewail that ag-
gressive nations are not quarantined.

There is only the modest little voice of Mr. Sec-
retary Hull piping meekly of the “outraged con-
science of mankind”—-too meekly to be heard in
Brussels. For there, United States delegate, Nor-
man H. Davis comforts everybody and Japan that
he is at the conference only. to observe trends, not
to instigate them.

A problem in international arithmetic is sub-
stituted: What if Japan had started to exter-
minate the seals in- the Paciﬁc instead of the
Chinese in China; how long before there would
have been a joint ultimatum from the U. S. and
Britain backed by a joint naval demonstration?

The answer can be solved-only by working out
the comparative commercial values of seal pelts
and Chinese pelts. This reporter is not up on her
commercial arithmetic . . . s -

FRESI-IMAN SEEKS

‘PARRY’ COLUMNIST
Editor, The Pitt News: .

If I may point, I should like to
make reply to Mr. Robert Saﬁ'ron’s
diatribe on my suggestion to place
at least one conservative columnist
among the rabble-rousing clamor-
ings of your opinion-expressing
Pitt News journalists.

‘ Mr. Saffron, through his erudite
and sagacious column, generously
appoints himself as being thetrue
conservative. ,_]And then at the

same time, he satirically throws“.

brick bats at our great Constitu-
tion and allour fundamental con-
cepts of capitalistic government.

If this man be The Pitt- News
conservative columnist, then I
shudder to think about the expres-
sions of, your more “pio.gressive’l
commentators. _ l_ . '

For the sake of giving all chan-
nels of thought within the Univer-
sity a fair .representation in The
Pitt News columns, I still insist
_t is the duty of this paper to have
a “Florence Fisher Parry’? or a
“Walter Lippman” or a “Frank
Kent.” As things stand today,
The Pitt News reflects only the
opinions of a vociferous but yet
minority representation of student
thought. _ .

In all fairness to the onserva-
tive element of the University of
Pittsburgh, the publication should
immediately inaugurate a column
which at least insome way pur-
ports to speak for this element.
Mr. Saffron I regret to say,. mere-
ly antagonizes them all the more
through his subversive bickerings.
——-Gerald Ziskind, ’41. I

Editor’s Note: The Pitt News
would appreciate Mr. Ziskind.’s
intoducing to us a. student “Parry,
Lippman, or Kent.” In passing
let" it be noted that Mr. Saﬁron’s
column really was satire.

Retail Training Student
Tells About Montreal

Graduate Of ‘ McGill University Discusses
Canadian Culture, American Differences

By Estelle R. Kovacs

Jean Richard Dupuis settled back in his library
other day with typical savoir-faire.
The Pitt News, and he would be glad to answer any
that its repres;.entalt.ive had to ask. I _ , I

Mr. Dupuis, fl graduate of McGill University in
Canada, is studying at present, at the Retail Training Bureau
at Pitt. . He chose the bureau because of its excellent rating in
this country; the bureau “chose Mr. Dupuis on.the basis of his

merce degree last year. . ._

Mr. Dupuis, has many interest
ing ‘sidelights to tell both about
the city in which he lives, and
about his undergraduate work at
McGill.

Montreal is-one of-the Canadian
cities in which, through many
years, two cultures have continued
to flourish and predominate, at
times ,—at.c,ross-purposes with each
other. One section of_t_h.e city is
deﬁnitely French, with"-‘ French
newspapers, = stores, theaters. -and
the like, while another is typically

ASSIMILATI_0N__ SLOW’

The assimilation of these two
radically different peoples _, has
been very slow, although Mr.’ Du-
puis admits that knowledge of at
least two languages-—French and
English—is practica‘l1y a‘"pre-'re-
quisite for any educated person.

Graduating from Mount Saint
Louis, a Catholic school for boys,
Mr. Dupuis took his degree at
McGill, where he was very active
in the Player’s Guild, the McGill
‘Daily, student publication‘ atsthe
University, and the organization
of Catholic brothers. ,

Sports at the university were
quite different from American
university sports, Mr. Dupuis ob.-
serves.

You’ll know him bya yellow

Cafferty, C38,, usually wears‘ a
brown plaid jacket, a serious ex-
pression and can be located prom-
enadingv the Commons Room.
Leo is one of the three.,,a_ides
who are apointed by Mr. Daufen-
baugh, assistant dean of men. It’s
his_duty to see that everything is-
in order around the Cathedral,
that no smoking goes on in the-
Commons Room, and to deliver’
messages from the _dean of men's
ofﬁce to the students. But Leo
likes. it. “I get a chance tomeet
lots of nice girls,” he said.

A speech major, Leo wants to
do commercial radio work, after
he graduates. He has already
written a script for a broadcast of
a Cap alnd,Gown show, and has
composed several songs for the
show; maybe you're still humming
his “Harlem Number’s Man.” As
an added attraction to radio ambi-

dle, by ear.

“It’s a great life, if you don’t
weaken,” he sighed, and looked

next to him. He tore himself
away just to answer these last
few questions.

“Yes, I like Wallace Beery, Chet

Panthers Attain Season’s Finest
Playing Point In Final Period
Of Thrilling Clash With Irish

By LEONARD LEVISON

Sports

Editor

South Bend, Ind-—For‘ six long’ weeks we waited for it.

.And Saturday it came.

It all happened in this Notre Dame Stadium. There wer

56,000‘ people here to see it. They saw what Was, perhaps, one
of the ‘great moments in football history.

was a peak in ‘Pitt foo-tb,a11.! The Panther snarled into itsfown
‘for the ﬁrst'tim"e this season, he came "to a full realization of

__his_. gridiron potentialities.
I In that fourth quarter, the‘ Pan-
thers, furied into action by an

‘Irish score, were the perfect foot-

ball team. Three times “within
eleven minutes, they” pushed the
scfori'ng“'valve' down and‘ trucked

. into the‘profrfised'-touclidown land.

 _. , "PITT I SPARKED  i  ,

Throughoutthe year" Pitt "had
been playing winning football.
But, in eviery oneof those vic-
tories there had been a certain
something missing. It was one of
those intangible things that sort
of side-step description. All of
the natural ‘materials were ob-
viously present in ratherlabundant
‘quantities, but they just weren’t
tapped off at the same time.

It required a Notre Dame quar-
terback to call the play that
brought the Panther to his high-
est ‘emotional ﬂow. He was the
‘same young man who sparked the
Irish to triumph over. Minnesota.
Andy Puplis ﬂinted the spark in
the Pitt tinclerbox.

PUPLIS HELPS
Of course, he was an unwitting

accomplice. All he did he thought

he was doing for the good of his
«country and Notre Dame. “Handy—
Andy,” along about the middle of
the third quarter, reached his
arms up, and looking over his
shoulder, handcuffed, a 20-yard
pass from Jack McCarthy. The
30 yards that remained between
Puplis and the goal ‘line were very

promptly covered, as the little‘

‘Notre Dame ﬁeld general zig-
zagged by the Pittsecondary.
GUESSERS WRONG

This was just what .-the Panther
needed.
disappeared. The “Pitt backﬁeld
went to work, and Stebbins, Pat-
rick, and Goldberg did the ground
gaining with the driving Pitt for-
ward line quashing all anarchial
opposition tendencies. _

Oh, yes, the, ﬁnal score was 21-6.
But, what’s in a score.

Whatever gauge you use to
measure champions , would have
showed Pitt with,th,e right dimen-
sions Saturday. Those who know
football called Pitt to win, ' but
they added, if I_‘{otre_ Dame scores
ﬁrst, beware of "the, Green.
logic was based on the fact that
a score would spirit thelrish with
enough vigor to carry them
through the game.

But, they reckoned that Panther
team wrong. Instead of disheart-
enment, it worked just the other
way. It was the first real danger
point for Pitt and all the faculties
of a great ‘team were united to
meet it. ' ’

GOLDBERG PASSES

As much a surprise as anything
else was the way in which the
Panthers came back. They used
the identical weapon which had
wounded them. Marshall Gold-
berg tossed the longest completed
pass that he has ever thrown, to
Fabian Hoffmann who criss-cross-
ed the ﬁeld to nab it. With, Chick-
erneo leadin.g the interference,
Hoffmann sprinted to the ﬁve-yard
line after gaining 45 yards.

Goldberg rammed up to the one
where Frank Patrick carried it
over. Frank Souchak’s unerring
toe brought Pitt out into the twi-
light zone of one-point security
with a placement kick. ’

This was just the beginning of
the pressure-applying tactics.
After kicking-off, the Panthers re-
ceived the ball back on their 33-
yard line. Then, on seven plays
they went up the ﬁeld for the sec-
ond touchdown. ’ '

STEBBINS SCORES

Harold Stebbins tucked the pig-
skin away after Marshall Gold-
berg handed it to him and, on a
complete reverse, ran wide around
left end, -cut back, and after 26
yards of that the score was 13-6.
Souchak got his boots in again
for the added point.

This seemed enough power to
turn loose for any team in a few
brief minutes, but it wasn’t enough
for the Panthers. Stebbins inter-
oepted an Irish pass on the 422
Notre Dame line. Classmate
Goldberg _‘scooped up 20 yards
around right end and Patrick just
added a little more by a 21-yard
scoring plunge through -the center
of the line. ‘

With the exception of the sec-

the ball to the goal line on one

es late in the ﬁnal period to gain
their edge in ﬁrst downs that gave
them victory.

The Penn State course is a flat

trained on the Schenley Park
.course which is far from being

i flat andthe biggest part of which

is grayel.

The diﬁerence in the type of
course had some effect upon-the
Panthers’ poor showing, but only
kept. them from placing one or
two men among the ﬁrst ﬁve. For
.as Carl Olson said, “There is no
doubt that the Penn State harriers
are better runners than our boys.
They, have the edge on experience
over us and when any team has
two such runners as Pete Olexy
and Frank Maule they hav_e a

Chemist Explains
Wassermann Tests

Serologist Lists °

Various Stages

In Blood Analysis

By J. A. WALKOWSKE,
Serologist, Public Health Depart-
ment.

Editor’s Note: The Pitt News
has been asked to explain in its
columns just what the process is,
in analyzilng blood after the stu-
dent takes his Wassermann test at
services. Mr. J. A.

lie Health, in the following article
explains the process.

All blood is withdrawn in
the student health services into
a regulation size test tube,
which is brought to us at the
end of each day.

Upon receipt .of the blood
specimens in the laboratory,
each‘ specimen is examined, mark-
ed, and ‘dated.

The blood forms a clot, which
is loosened, if necessary, with a
glass rod, and the blood is centri-
fuged in order to complete the
separation of the serum (a watery
substance in the blood) from the
clot. The clear serum is then
piped into a marked tube, and in-
activated in a water bath for 30
minutes at 55 degrees Centigrade.

REACTION PREPARED

All necessary equipment for
the test is prepared before mix-
ing with an antigen suspension.

The antigen is then mixed with
physiological salt solution accord-
ing to the required ﬁgure, and al-
lowed to stand for 10 minutes. The
antigen ﬁnally is mixed with the
serum solution in the tube.

The tube is shaken vigorously
for about ten seconds, by hand, to
insure thorough mixing of the in-
gredients. The individual tube is
set aside temporarily until a giv-
en number of tests are ready,
after which time they are ready
for the regular three-minute
shaking period in a machine. After
the serum—suspension mixtures
have been shaken, one cubic cen-

to each tube.
REACTION FIGURED

Results are read after the addi-
tion of the salt solution.

The reactions gotten, four plus
and one negative, are ﬁgured in

‘visible particles are suspended in
a transparent or opalescent medi-

readily visible by direct examina-
tion. Four—plus reactions are a
pretty deﬁnite sign of syphilis.

Three plus—In these, the par-
ticles are also deﬁnitely visible,
but are less clear-cut than in the
four—plus.

Two plus—In these, ﬁner par-
ticles are suspended in a some-
what turbid medium, requiring a
closer examination, usually by a
special lamp.

One plus—In these, still ﬁner
particles are suspended in a tur-
bid medium. This is the least
positive syphilis sign.

TWO TESTS USED

Negative reactions —— In these,
the medium is transparent and
opalescent and free from visible
particles. In the tube, negative
reactions are readily distinguished
from weak positive reactions by
the fact that the latter appear
turbid.

The two tests used as an alter-
native to -the Wassermann are the

Violinist Gives
Special Recital

The committee for the Yugo-

announced a special student tick-
et rate for the violin concert of
Zlato Balokovic Wednesday eve-
ning in Carnegie music hall.

Special student rate for the con-
cert, which is under the sponsor-
ship of the committee, is 25 ‘cents.
Tickets may be obtained at the
office of Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, adviser on nationality
rooms, 1309 Cathedral.

Wednesday’s program by Balc-
kovic, World-famous Yugoslav
violinist, will include selections
from the violin classical repertory,

and a group of native folk songs. ‘

The Violinist is now on a tour
of the United States, during which
he is appearing as soloist with the

Cleveland ‘orchestra. Beginning
in March, he will tour several Eu-

is expensive, and is often less ex-

November Issue
Carries Survey
Of’ Argentina

“The people of Argentina pre-
fer a government of moderation
to one of the extreme right or the
extreme left.”

This is the opinion of Dr. N.
Andrew N. Cleven, professor of
history, who discussed Argentina
in the November issue of
“Events,” a monthly review of
world affairs. The article, “Ar-
gentina Elects a Presiden ,” is the
ﬁrst in a series of “surveys of the
political, economical, and social
situation in Latin America.

, ARGENTINE ECONOMICS

Showing that Argentina today
is a progressive nation, Dr. Cleven
comments that, “This progress
has not been accidental, but is the
natural result of circumstances.”
Although blessed with a negligible
race problem and a rich country,
Argentina’s ﬁrst years of inde-
pendence were threatened by na-
tional strife; and “rib country in
America has produced a larger
numbenor a more powerful group
of ea_1.;1_¢_§los (‘dictators).”

Of paramount interest to Amer-
icans concerning Argentina’s pres-
ent day economic position, Dr.
Cleven maintains, is the fact that,
“Commercial relations between
Argentina and the United States
are greatly in need of improve-
ment. Until new arrangements
are made, the exporters of the
United States have to compete
with European exporters under
unfavorable conditions.”

LAUDS IVIINISTER.

Carlos Saavedra Lamas, receives
several laudatory comments from
Dr. Cleven. Pointing out the hu-
manitarian work of Dr. Lamas,
Dr. Cleven declares, “his (Dr.
Lamas’) election to the presiden-
cy of the League Assembly in
1936 was a recognition of his serv-
ices in the cause of international
harmony and peace.”

In the next issue of “Events,”
Dr. Cleven, whose special ﬁeld is
Latin-America, will summarize
the “Political Situation in Brazil.”
Following issues will contain ar-
ticles on Cuba, Mexico, Peru,
Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, and
the smaller. nations of South
