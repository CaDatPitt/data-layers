Pitt basketball playersaccused of assault  I

By" Marc Duchin

‘Assistant News Editor

Pitt basketball players Jerome -

Lane, Demetreus Gore and Steve
Maslek allegedly were identified
assaulting two Pitt students at a
party on 3821 Dawson Street ear-
Iy Saturday morning according to
a Pittsburgh Police report filed by
Officer R.L. Perry.

‘According to the police report
the primary victim, Robert M.
Scott, 20, received bruised ribs,
abrasions, cuts and contusions on
both eyes f as a result of the

_ beating.

Chris Gariti was also listed in
the police report as a victim.

,Lane, 20, and Core, 21, could
not be reached for comment.

According to the police report,
the incident began when Scott

-and a roommate walked next»

door to the party where six or
seven white and black males who
were from the Pitt Basketball
team started to beat up on Scott.

This action was due to the fact
Scott's brother had beer poured
on his head by a player named
Maslek, according to the report.

Scott said that the beating was

, unprovoked. ‘ .

’’It began when we were at a
party at 3821 Dawson [Street],”
said Scott. ”My brother was walk-
ing through a crowded area,
bumped in to Maslek and acci-
dently spilled a little bit ofbeer
on Mas|ek’s pants. Maslek start-
ed swearing and cussing at my
brother and threw a beer in his‘
face!’ I »

Scott said that_a friend of his
went over to protect Scott's
brother and started fighting Mas-

lek in the apartment. Scott said af-
ter the fight was over he talked
with Maslek for five or» 10
minutes about the incident. Mas-
lek apologized and left theaparty
at approximately 11 pm". ,

' According to Scott, Maslek, 20,
came back at approximately 2
a.m. with Rod Brookin, 19,
another player on the Pitt basket-
ball team, Gore, Lane and others
Scott didn't know. Scott said
there were approximately seven
males congregating on the balco-
ny of 3821 Dawson St.

_”My roommate and I were at
our place which was next-door to
the party,” said Scott. ”It was late
and the party was breaking_up
when we decided to go back to
the party to get a beer. I was
walking over to the door when
Jerome Lane punched me right in

the face.

”The building's security guard
[Darrell Brown] came out and
tried to keep all of them off of me.
As I was trying to walk away from
them they were reaching across‘
and punching me. Lane punched
me a second time and I looked at
him and said ‘Why are you do-
ingthis to me? I like you. I watch
you play basketball.’ He said
‘You don't even know me.’ "

Scott said that Gore then
punched him in the face.

According to Scott» he was tack-
led and the balcony banister gave
way. ”We fell over the balcony.
Lane landed right on my back
and was punching me in the face
when I was on the ground. Mas-
lek kicked me a few times when
I was on the ground too,_” Scott
added. I

Pittsburgh's newest star, the

Capital Fund Campaign headed
by Howard M. Love, Chairman of
National Intergroup,raised $3.5
million in June. An expected ad-

size is something of which all in-

thrilled and proud.

Because the stage has gained a
significant amount of area (which

enables up to three separate '

operas to be staged in a week), it
will be able to accomodate many
more types of performances than
ever before._ Benedum Center

PHILADELPHIA — President
Reagan is expected to campaign
in Pennsylvania to help Republi-

* : cans try to win control of the state

House, a White House political
aide said Sunday. I

Jeff Lord, associate director of
the White House Office of Polit-
ical Affairs, said Reagan will fo-
cus on Pennsylvania and other
states where the margin of con-
trol is slim enough to be changed
in the 1988 statewide elections.
Democrats control the state
House by two seats, with all 203
seats up for grabs next year.

Lord, speaking at the Republi-
can State Committee's leadership
conference, said_Reagan is mak-
ing the state races a priority be-
cause of coming reapportionment
decisions, in which state legisla-
tures will redraw congressional
district boundaries after the 1990
census.
.. He also predicted ‘voters would
keep a Republican in the White
House next year because he said
the Democratic candidates don't
differ from Walter Mondale. Rea-
gan clobbered Mondale in the

NATIONAL BRIEFS
ASSOCIATED PRESS

1984 election.

”Their platform is not substan-
tially different from the one
Walter Mondale ran on in 1984,”
Lord said. He added that‘White
House polls show the Democrat-
ic platform has no more support
today than it did in 1984 or in
1980, when Reagan defeated in-

cumbent Democrat Jimmy
Carter.
Lord's speech capped a

weekend‘ program that was some-

times festive, sometimes conten- ~

tious. The conference provided
an opportunity for Republican
leaders to lick their wounds from
losing the governor's race last fall
and gave a platform to GOP
hopefuls running for attorney
general, auditor general and
treasurer next year.

It also provided the setting for
a bitter debate over Supreme
Court Justice Rolf Larsen’s‘bid for
retention, which will be on the

Convictions up during
Reagan's presidency

WASHINGTON — The num-
ber of federal convictions for
white-collar crime rose 18 per-
cent in the first five years of the
Reagan administration while con-
victions .for other types of crime
went up more than twice as fast,
the government said in a report
released Sunday.

The study, the first national sur-
vey of its kind issued by the
Justice Department's Bureau of

‘ Justice Statistics, also found that

white-collar criminals were less
likely than other types of crimi-
nals to be sentenced to prison.

The bureau reported that

THE PITT News, Monday, September 28, 1987

10,733 defendants were convict-
ed of federal white-collar crimes
in 1985, up about 1,600 from
1980. Meanwhile, federal con-
victions of non—white—collar
crimes rose 43 percent from 1980
to 1985 to about 30,000.

The average lengthof a prison
sentence for a white-collar crimi-
nal rose 20 percent to 29 months
in 1985, compared with two
years in 1980, the report con-
cluded. The average length of a
prison sentence for other types of
federal criminals was 50 months
in 1985, about the same as it had
been five years earlier.

Tax fraud convictions of or-
ganized crime figures and drug
dealers contributed to the trend
of somewhat longer sentences for

white-collar criminals. The study

cited an 86 percent increase in
the average_length of prison sen-
tences handed out to those con-
victed of tax fraud from 1980 to
1985, from 11 months to 21
months.

On the incarceration rate, the
bureau found that 40 percent of
convicted white-collar criminals

Reagan expected to boost Republicans in PA

were sentenced to prison in -

1985, compared with 54 percent
of the non—white—collar criminals.
The rate for white-collar criminals
in 1985 was about the same as in
I 980.

Police fear new law
could lead to battles

MIAMI — Boosters hail it as a
triumph of the right to bear arms,
but police here fear that when
Florida's new gun law goes into
effect, routine fender-benders
could turn into Dodge'City-style
shootouts.

As of Oct. 1, all Floridians can
strap on a sidearm in plain view
without any kind of permit. If
they prefer to conceal the
weapon, they can join up to
60,000 residents expected to ap-
ply for new streamlined state
permits.

”This could set us back_10O
years to the time of the Wild
West,” a gloomy Broward
County Sheriff Nick Navarro said
lastweek. '

Think about college. Think
about college without music. Im-
possible! You can't have a party
without music. Some people
can't study without music, and
how can you dance in your un-
den/vear when your roommate
isn't around?

But for some Pitt students, mus-
ic was meant to be performed.

  
 

So they form bands.

Although fun is surely the
pretense for the forming of many
of these bands, not all see it as
just fun. Some students consider
their music a job.

Mike Meddock, Sr., who plays
drums for his rock group Fine
Line, considers his music a job —
a fun job.

’’It helps pay my bills and gives
me money to live off of. I'd have
to get a real job if I didn't have

this,” Meddock said.

Meddock also said that playing
with the band is time consuming.
”We usually perform two nights
a week and practice one. I'm not
like a typical student. I have to
squeeze my entire week into four
days,” Meddock added. ”Some-
times after a late night playing,
you just need a day to mellow

”Professors haven't been under-
standing because they really
don't know that it is a job."
S_choolwork, Meddock said,
isn't the only part of college life
that he has missed out on. ’’In
three years I have been to two
football games. My weekends are
shot to hell,” He said. ”Unlike

most students, I can't go to any .

of the weekend parties, but at
least I still have Thursday nights.”

Meddock cites several ways
that his involvement in music has
helped him prepare for life after
school. He said it helps him re-
late and communicate with peo-
ple, which is important in
interviews, and it looks good on
a resume. He added, ”lt shows
that you are disciplined.”

Even though hehas no career
aspirations, Meddock said he
wouldn't mind being a profes-

For The Pitt News

Quo Vadis is a group many
people at the University of Pitts-
burgh probably have little
knowledge of. However, this
group has been with Pitt as long
as our renowned Nationality
Rooms in the Cathedral of
Learning.

This association of 25 to 30 stu-

’ dent volunteers primarily func-

tions as a tour—giving group for
the Nationality Rooms — hosting
tours for students, adults, senior

‘citizens, civil groups and even

national and international VIPs.

These tours offer a great deal of
information about each of the 21
different rooms, and they -also
give people a chance to witness
firsthand the excellent craftsman-
ship and careful upkeep of the
ethnic rooms at Pitt.

With such a wide variety of na-
tionalities represented in these
rooms, chances are that most
people can identify with at least
one of them.

Barbara Myers, Quo Vadis ad-
visor and tour guide, said the Na-
tionality Rooms were built (the
first of them in 1938) to create a
’’favorable impression of the
university and its students.” She
also said, ”The authenticity they
[the rooms] show was to be a

 Makingacademic and musical harmony

however, that, ’’If I'm around af-
ter graduation, l’d surely like to
keep doing it.”

Joe Waslovsky, Sr., also con-
siders his role as drummer for the
group Feelin’ All Right a job. ’’I’m
putting myself through school by
being part of a music group,” he
said.

”We played parties, clubs and
even did the music for an MTV
commercial, but most of that was
in the summer. During school we
have to tone it down,” said Was-
lovsky.

Waslovsky has definite career
aspirations. ”Music has always
been my main interest. After I
graduate, I'm going to a special
music school for drummers.”

Unlike the other two, Alex
Weibel, .Sr.,. doesn't consider
playing his music a job. "I play
one or two nights a week for
fun,” he said.

Quo Vadis keeps 
ethnic tradition alive

reflection of the genuine educa-
tion that the University of Pitts-

burgh offered at its conception‘

and is still offering today.”

Brian Rasmus ' and Brian
Trentes, two other guides for Quo
Vadis, agree that these rooms are
”living history” and definitely
deserve all the recognition that
they get.

One of the biggest events for
Quo Vadis this year is the open-
ing of a new room —— the first

.since 1957. The Israel Heritage

Room is expected to be open to
the public by November of this
yeah

Another new room, the.Arme-
nian Room, is scheduled to open
in 1988. The ethnic groups of
Pittsburgh, who raise money and

‘construct these rooms on their

own, do not plan to stop at just
two new rooms, though. Plans
are being made for an African

Heritage and an Austrian room.

Quo Vadis has stepped outside
of the Cathedral, too. Being a
service organization, they annu-
ally assist in freshman orientation,
alumni functions, the Christmas
decorating of the Nationality
Rooms for Open House (Dec. 6),
the President's Picnic and, more

recently, the major forum at Pres- -

byterian Hospital concerning
transplants.

Assault

Continued from page 1
”They broke the door down. I
was coming around the corner
when they just jumped on me
and said he's probably in on it
and started hitting me in the
head. They punched me and then
ran upstairs.”

Brookin; a 6-5 sophomore,
could not be reached for
comment. V

”l was just sitting on the couch
when I heard banging. on the

- door,” said Scott Cambell, a resi-

dent of 3821 Dawson St. ‘'1 then
saw Gore, Lane, Brookin and
Maslek come in and ask a kid on
the couch if he was in a fight. He
said no, and they deckedhim in
the eye.”

The victim Cambell spoke of
was identified as Ahmed Mu-
hammed. ”l was sitting on the
couch; I didn't say anything and

one of them clobbered me,” said
Muhammed.

Witness Donald Evans, a Pitt
junior, said he saw Lane run af-
ter the assault on Scott and fall
down. ’.’I knew who [Gore and

Lane] were because I happen to
watch basketball,” ‘said Evans.

According to the police report
the perpetrators jumped into four

different cars and pulled away.,

Lane, a 6-6 junior forward, was

Make a run for it!  

Pittsburgh's Great Race attracts fans from all over

‘I-."_f

By Mindy Boffemmyer

mrMeHﬂNw6 ’

”The most important thing was

‘to win the race and not worry

about running a fast time,” said
Keith Brantly, winner of yester-
day's Great Race.

The 10 km. (6.2 mile) race be-
gan at Frick Park in Squirrel Hill
at 9 a.m. and concluded at Point
State Park where contestants
crossed the finish line at an ap-
proximate rate of 500 per minute.

Brantly, who finished first, said
he was ”not ecstatic, but satis-
fied” with his performance.

’’I ran a fairly fast time — not
as fast as I would liked to have
run, but considering the field and
some of the guys who finished
back in the seventh and eighth
places, I can't be too disappoint-
ed,” he said. ~

This year the Great Race at-
tracted 12,807 runners (com-
pared to. 12,260 last year) from
more than 40 states and several
foreign countries.

The event offered over $15,000

. in prizes to top finishers in vari-

ous categories, including the top
m_ale and female finishers‘ and
winners in the Master's,
Challenged and Corporate di-
visions. V

The top three male finishers
were Keith Brantly (28:17), Greg
Beardsley (28:30) and John Doub
(28:33).

The top three female finishers
were Maureen Custy (32:37),
Cyndie Welte (32:39) and Shelly
Steely (32:59).

Top male and female finishers
each receive a $2,000 prize, se-
cond place finishers a $1,000
prize and, for third -place, an
$800 prize.

The remaining prize money
was divided among finishers from
fourth to 12th place as well as
winners in the other categories.
Citiparks was responsible for ob-
taining sponsors and organizing
the race and related events.

‘ Landmark Savings Association
was the official 1987 sponsor for
the Great Race. Corporate fore-

runners included Kaufmann’s,'

Pepsi, Lite Beer and Pittsburgh
Area Nissan Dealers. The cor-
porate team sponsor was Wen-
dy’s of Greater Pittsburgh, and
the media sponsor was KDKA Ra-
dio/T V. Cooperative support was
also given by the Pittsburgh Hil-
ton and Towers.‘ _
Pittsburgh's Great Race is the
fifth largest 10 km. race in the
country, the ninth largest road

race overall and the fourth fastest -
10 km. course. Most of the run— ‘

ners interviewed found the
course challenging.

. Margaret Groos of Nashville,
Tenn., (who finished fourth
among the women) was pleased
with her performance. She said’
she had been ”off for two weeks

Bergman went_on to say that’

old members in the sorority will
not function in the chapter until
new members have been
“selected.

”We’ve had a really good
response from students who want
to get involved in the sorority,”
she said. ”About 60 girls have

signed up at this time. We're
pushing that this is a really good
opportunity for leadership ex-
penence.

' ”This is the first time that Kap-
pa Alpha Theta has tried this,”
said Bergman. ”Most of the girls
are really excited that we're try-
ing to make this chapter function
again.”

Natelie Updegrove of State
College was also ”fairly pleased”
with her performance. ’’I had

been going through a slump, and

this race makes me feel like I am

Bob Long of Schaler, Pa., com-

the two rear wheels of his‘wheel-

this achievement. ’’It was never
done or attempted-before,” he

said. Long admits the race was
difficult for him at times -— espe-
cially the steep hills which he
ascended backwards —— but he
made it with the help of his train-
er, Mark Rehale.

Lawmakers return to capitol; prepare for agenda  

 

HARRISBURG -— Lawmakers return to

-the capitol this week as their summer
A recess ends and the General Assembly

prepares to tackle a slate of issues rang-
ing from local tax reform to environmen-
tal proposals.

Eight senators and 88 members of the
House will have new offices in the glit-

tering $124 million capitol expansion as

they resume their duties here.

While those members spend some time
getting accustomed to the new surround-
ings, legislative leaders in the House and
Senate will be using the first few days
back to firm up their agenda for the weeks
to come. '

”We want to get a better sense of where
the members are” on issues, said Stephen
MacNett, an aide to Senate Republican
leaders. ”|t’s part of the normal process.”

Aides to legislative leaders say some of
the issues likely to be tackled include es-
tablishment of a state Superfund to help
clean up toxic waste sites, changes to the
state's auto insurance laws, programs to

help the elderly and the tax issue.

The General Assembly will meet in a
special session, called for by Gov. Robert
P. Casey, after the November statewide
elections to consider changes to the tax-

ing powers of local governments. Much’

of the debate is expected to concentrate
on alternatives for the overburdened
property tax.

On environmental issues, the Legisla-
ture faces a Jan. 1 deadline for approving
legislation detailing how a spot will be
chosen for a regional low—level radioac-
tive waste site in Pennsylvania.

The House also wants to consider a bill
that would eventually increase the current
$3.35 minimum wage to $4.65, said An-
thony Barbush, an aide to House Majori-
ty Leader James Manderino,
D—Westmoreland.

Local woman to meet again
with brother in Soviet town
PITTSBURGH — A woman is hoping to

' be reunited» in the Soviet Union next

month with her younger brother, who she
has not seen since they were separated
by Nazi soldiers there 44 years ago.

Galina Petrova Tokarsky, 63, of subur-
ban Wilkins Township, also had hoped
to see her mother. But she said Sunday
that she's since learned her mother is
dead.

Tokarsky received a letter Sept. 19 say-
ing her mother was alive and looking for
her, and she placed a call to her mother's
home two days later. Her brother an-
swered when the call finally went through
Friday. -

’’I said, ‘mama, mama,’ and he said,
‘No, it's Ura,’ my brother, and he told me
that mama has passed away,” she said.
’’I couldn't find the words to say very
much. I lost all the words in the speech

required.

Widow has troublerelaxing for men  

Q: My brother went to bed
with a widow of 45 who had
been married and having sex
with her husband for 77 years.
Yet when he tried to make love
to her, she could not relax and let
him in. This is the story he told
me, and I wonder if it can be
true. What do you say?

A: This could happen. Let's not
fall into the fallacy of thinking
that things within the realm of
physical possibility cannot hap-
pen. Now if you told me‘ your
brother just looked at the lady
and she got pregnant, I would be
doubtful to the point of saying,
”No, he didn't. Don't tell me sto-

DR. RII'I'I-I
WESTHEIMER

ries.” But she could be incapable
of relaxing those muscles down
there to allow sexual intercourse.

Perhaps you have the idea that
this happens (we call it vaginis-
mus) only to virgins. Not true.
The widow could have been
thinking of her late husband and
feeling too guilty and fearful to al-
low a new man to make love to
her, even though in her cons-
cious mind she wanted to. But if

she becomes more used to your
brother, and more used to having
him in her bed, together they

‘may get her to relax. If not, they

had best consult a sex therapist.
Q: Why do so many men suffer
from premature ejaculation?
A: If you ever find out, plese
tell me. We do not know the rea-
son for this widespread sexual

dysfunction, but many theories ’

have been put forward — one be-
ing that the young male human

being stimulates himself in a big _

hurry because he is afraid of be-
ing caught doing it. Another the-
ory is that the young male has no
idea of the pleasure of long fore-

  

play with a loving partner, but
thinks only of that remarkable
sensation which is almost always-
available to the male — the sex-
ual climax.

Another is that the young male
does not fantasize about a play-
ful, cooperative partner because
he is at that age only thinking of‘
himself and, indeed, does not
realize that there are willing sex-

ual partners among female hu-_ ~ I

manity. He thinks that women
are all reluctant sex partners, and
it never occurs to him that the
sexual encounter should be
drawn out, not hurried, because

. she likes it and wants it to last.

Time for a career

 

 

ELLEN
GOODMAN

By the time Robert Bork
‘walked out of the senate cham-
bers, I’d had a change of heart.
The movement to dump Bork is
all wrong. What we need is a
more sympathetic approach to
the problem. A movement to free
Bork.

When Bob was a mere youth,
he got into the wrong line of
work. It happens all the time. He
has spent too much of his life

' suffering from a conflict between

his personal sense of what's good
and his professional sense of
what's legal. The man is utterly
ripe for midcareer liberation.

What I learned from Bork’s tes-
timony is that if you spend
enough time splitting hairs, pret-
ty soon you have a split personal-
ity. ln Bork’s life, moral rights
continually wrestled with institu-
tional rights —— and lost.

Think about what Bork could
have been if he hadn't misspent
his youth, not to mention his mid-
life, as a jurist. To begin with,
there is his attitude toward the
poll taxes which once thwarted
black voters. Bork the man
doesn't think that the old poll tax-
es were right. ’’I don't like them
myself." But Bork the jurist
doesn't think the ruling that
struck down these taxes was right

either. ”I just don't see the legal
judgement there.”

Then there is his attitude
toward sterilization. Citizen Bork
knows the state of Oklahoma had
no business sterilizing criminals.
”There is no scientific evidence
 that criminality is really genet-
ically carried.” But lawyer Bork
doesn't think the Court had any
business striking this law down.
 Not on the grounds stated
there 

The double bind —— personal
and legal — also applies to birth
control. The modern man facing
the senators surely doesn't ap-

prove the banning of birth con— .

trol for married couples. He calls
the old Connecticut law, ”nutty.”
But the nominee for the Supreme
Court wouldn't have joined the
majority in cracking that nut. It's
a matter of principle, legal
principle.

It's enough to make you feel
sorry for the man who got lost in
the voluminous trappings of the
black robe. In the opening days
of the hearings, senators like
Kennedy and DeConcini talked
about such lofty things as in-
dividual liberty and equality,
while Bork wandered about in
the footnotes of the arcane and
convoluted ”princip|e.” It was
the Saturday Night Massacre all
over again. In what Bork refers to
as ”the events of Oct. 20,” Elliot
Richardson and William Ruckel-
shaus were the ones who quit on
moral grounds, while Bork stayed
on technical grounds.

There is something almost per-
verse in the Bork story. One of

the senators wished for a psy- ‘

chiatrist to predict Bork’s deci-
sions on the bench. I wished for
a psychiatrist to analyze the in-
tellectual destruction of his own
moral principles.

If the man is being sincere and
not slippery about his real opi_n—

ions on race, sex and privacy, the .
\

former professor has been
trapped by tortured legal reason-
ing into reversing himself.

Other judges, particularly
Supreme Court judges, have
found in the Constitution a basis
for individual justice, but Bork
often found the opposite. In his
case, judicial restraint is a pair of
moral handcuffs.

I was particularly struck by
Bork’s spirited defense of his
views on sexual equality. Bork
did admit to worrying about uni-
sex toilets — can we ever put a
lid on that issue — but I am sure
he isn't in favor of sexual harass-
ment. But at the same time, he
can't rule it out. Again and again,
he finds no principle for his prin-
ciples. -

Bork’s split personality has
come with a case of Constitution-
al cramps. In his narrow view, all
sorts of change should come from
the legislature, not the judiciary.
If you want to move beyond the
original intent of the framers, he

change for Bork

insists, don't do it with interpre-
tation. Go to the legislature.

Is there a hint in all this? A sub-
conscious desire for a new
career? As chair of the Free Bork
Movement, I think we should im-
mediately liberate the man from
his paralyzing judicial restraints.

Emancipate the professor and

jurist from the conflicts he fabri-
cates between moral principle
and legal principle. Send him
where he sees the power.

As a legislator, the Bork we met

at the hearings might turn into i

one of the great defenders of
privacy and civil liberties. As a
Supreme Court justice, he's like-
ly to be a great threat to them.
The solution is simple. Stop the
hearings. This isn't time for a
court change; it's time for a career
change.
Robert Bork for Congress.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 28, I987

Fatal Attraction and fatal weakness .

 

lJEFF SEWALD

BETWEEN THE LINES
m

The other night, a friend and I
went to see the movie Fatal At-
traction. You’ve probably heard
of it. It’s the one where Michael
Douglas, a lawyer this time , finds
himself in bed with Glenn Close,
an attractive literary editor who,
in addition to demonstrating her
sexual prowess, has a tendency
to drift into psychotic rage.
There's some knife wielding, a
cursory slashing of the wrists, etc.
The result is rather hazardous af-
fair for both parties and a pretty
intense movie. "

I gave the film a ”thumbs-up”
because it's been years since I've

had such a visceral reaction to a
first—run thriller. But my reaction
wasn't confined to the thrills. The
film also made me think, mostly
about its subtle depiction of the
fragile and vulnerable human
psyche and how psychosexual
impulses can become the guiding
force of self-destruction.

In the film, Michael Douglas is
financially successful and happi-

ly married. Nevertheless, he de-

cides to play Cassanova one
weekend when his family is
away. There is no signof marital
discord or decay. Douglas just
lets his ego and machismo run‘
rampant and hops into the sack
with a business associate (Glenn
Close). _ -

It is supposed to be a one—time
fling. The ”other woman,”
however, doesn't see it that way.
Sensing the intentions of her
lover (which are to say ”it’s
over”), she retreats into feelings
of rejection which helps "awaken
her dormant psychosis and, con-
sequently, kicks it into overdrive
as she begins to frantically persue
her would-be mate. The knife
wielding has begun.

' As a man,_Michael Douglas’.

character made me nauseous.
We're talking about a guy who

has everything and seems basical-
ly happy, but decides to play
roulette with his situation any-
way. Figure that one out. I guess
whensex is involved, rationale
takes a back seat.

I don't intend to bring morals
into this. It wasn't the character's
infidelity that bothered me. It was
his weakness. The weakness that
‘makes him vulnerable to the
come-ons of a seducer like
Close’s character. The weakness
that leads him to try‘*to hide his
imprudent behavior, even though
he knows the situation could
mean danger for his family. And
finally, the weakness he displays
in failing to take control of the
predicament he creates when its
intensity reaches its peak.

I don't believe for one second
that Douglas’ character's reasons
for not killing his mistress are
based insmorality. He wants to
kill her but he can't summon up
the nerve to do so, not even
when she hands him the oppor-
tunity. He is suddenly helpless,
against someone whose mind, al-
beit warped, far exceeds his in its
desire. If not for his wife, (who
should have kicked his teeth in
when he finally admitted his in-
descretion to her) Douglas’

lln a nLnshell.”

”I think I learned something the night I sawjoelackson get
hit over the headwith a sandwich. He was down on his
knees at the front of the stage, singing away, having this
emotional experience, and this guy comes up and whacks .-
g him over the head with this fucking sandwich. What can

you do after that? Nothing.”

(lead singer for the Simple Minds.)

CRARY

Editor's Note: The following
columns are being featured
together because of their similar
subject matter.

Artek is a study in ideals and ar-
chitecture. This company was an
effort of tortured genius by a
member of the Pittsburgh Com-
munity. Antonio Dechischis, a
former architecture professor
from CMU and admirer of Buck-
minster Fuller, designed a build-
ing system which uses ball joints.
and struts as the space frame for
triangular building panels. His
client, Thomas Ammons from
WQED, now livesin the strange
and fascinating Ammons House,
just outside Pittsburgh. The build-
ing took a few years to build, be-
cause no one would finance it

_with a" loan. In.many ways, it is

like a fable of human per-
severance.

‘Because the house is strange,

 

many people think it is ugly. Yet '

it is spacious and cost effective,
and the building technique has
potential for mass-industry. Un-
fortunately, like most businesses
from around Pittsburgh, Artek is
compelled to work within the
limitations of intelligence typified
by the labor movement and the
stagnation of modern, macho-
honcho American labor gangs.
For this reason, I sense, they are

a dispirited group, literally on the _

run from their own potentials. I
don't suppose many people are
much interested. -
Housing shortages are acute in
the world, and this is not just true
of America. America, the lofty
land, cannot build enough
shelter. This is mostly a fashion
problem. People do not wish to
live in houses which
strange, but which are technolog-
ically feasible and cost effective.
We can't even build prisons fast
enough. That, incidentally, is the

real reason why the Military-‘

Industrial Complex is desperate-

ly trying to whip up a war. If you

can't house people, can't even

look .

  

gonna do but you say goodbye,
what you gonna do but get them
gone, gone, gone.

It is hard for me to say that the
Artek shelter is noble, o_r ideal, I
know too well what sort of
management problems they
seem to have, and this makes me
hesitantto recommend them as
an investment strategy for the
housing and urban renewal port-
folio. Yet, I think Artek is a won-
derfu} parable, in that the
building is real and beautiful in
its own way, and the necessary
labor-management relations exist
in the realm of possibility, which,

like the state of grace, is as far

away as your conscience.

V During the drive home,  



friend and I got into a conversa-, 
tion (or rather I launched into a
discourse) about how many men 
fit into the mold of Doug|as’- , 
character. I'd hazard a guess that. i

there are a few women like‘ 
Glenn Close’s creation out.there 
today as well. To be fair, there are 

also many loving wives.

trolled, in varying degrees, by the P
"relationship between our egos ‘

and our sexuality — the same 
way addicts are controlled by 

heroin, cocaine or alcohol.

fact, the reverse holds true as

well. Deep down, I think both 

men and women know this.

In the film, it is the man's weak— 3 

ness that fuels an increasingly

volatile situation. But it could just" 

have easily been a woman's.

To me, Fatal Attraction is an in- ” 

teresting look at the physical and
psychological ravages of sexual
indescretion. Relationships are

intensified when sex is involved. A

week's Pitt—Temple game. Tem-
ple head Coach Bruce Arians
went with the two tight end
offense to neutralize Pitt's
defense, which resembles that of
the Chicago Bears ”46” defense.
-”They used a two tight end

_ offense that enabled them to run

the option,” Said Gottfried.

The third quarter passed by
rather uneventfully but not
without a little drama.

Panther Eugene Napoleon, West

Pitt until West Virginia's worst
enemy showed up — the
turnover.

On an option play, Harris kept
the ball, but junior defensive end-
Burt Grossman hit Harris, and
linebacker Ezekial Gadson reco-
vered at the West Virginia
21-yard line with 4:50 remaining
in the game. .

”I stepped back, and the guy
[Grossman] penetrated," Harris
said. ”He hit my blind side, and
I coughed it up.

”When he hit me, I tried to
look for it as I hit the ground. We
tried to eliminate mistakes, but
we Couldn’t,” he added.

”It was an option away. I had
a down blOCk,” said Grossman.
”The quarterback tried to run,
then he held up. I pulled his arm
down as he fumbled the ball.”

”It happened so quick. I didn't
think about what he [Harris] was
going to do,” said Gadson, who
led the defense with 12 tackles.

”I just had to make the big play.’’

After four plays, VanHorne
made good on his 40-yard at-
tempt with 2:45 remaining for the
final margin-.

’’I felt bad after missing that first
one, but I told myself I. had to
Come back. I had to keep my con-
centration leveI,” VanHorne said.

The Mountaineers had one last
Chance to move the football, and
they almost did that. —

On their first play, Napoleon,
who finished the game with 88
yards on only 12 attempts, car-
ried for 17 yards, but he may
have gone all the way if he had
not stepped out of bounds.

”Napo|eOn stepped out of
bounds. It was a good Call by the

official. But if he wasn't out, that .

makes a big difference in the
game. It was just that much  but
he was. Out. I saw it,” said
Nehlen.

That may have taken the wind
Out of West Virginia's sails be-
cause they could only gain three
more yards.

On fourth down, Gadson bar-
relled through the line of scrim-
mage and sacked Harris for a
14-yard loss. Pitt took possession
and ran out the remaining 1:58
of the game.

”On the last play [sack], the
Coach Called for_ a blitz. Harris
dropped back, and I came from
the Outside. NO one picked me
up, and I made the big play,”
Gadson said

' ”The defensive coaches want-
ed to blitz to prevent anything
from developing downfield,”
said Gottfried.

”OnCe you get down to less
than two and a half minutes or so,
it's tough to punt. I felt we should
go for it,” said Nehlen.

Q

The West Virginia record now '

stands at 1-3, but it's not from a
lack of trying. They are receiving
praise from both sides of the field.

. ”We knew West Virginia
wasn't going to be a slouch. They
played hard,” said Heyward,
who rushed for 115 yards, his
fourth consecutive 100-yard
game. ”They definitely had last
year's game on their mind. They
played a great game.”

”Every one of these teams
we've played the last three weeks
[Ohio State, Maryland and Pitt] is
a Top 20 team, and if those teams
are in the Top 20, we're just one

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, September 28, 1987

By Frank Sioli

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh's
women's tennis team pulled off
two consecutive matches this
week by crushing West Liberty
8-1 on Wednesday and defeating
Duquesne on Friday

With the two victories, the
Lady Panthers improved their
season to 3-4., By winning three
out of their last four matches, the
team has proved they really are
working harder as one whole
unit, and by the end of the sea-
son, should be primed and ready

. for the Big East Conference

Championships.

The match against West Liberty
on Wednesday was a much-
needed victory for the team.
Coming at a time in the season
when four or five matches are
played per week, Robert Morris
cancelled its scheduled match on
Tuesday. This gave the team a
much-needed rest from the drain-
irig schedule and left time to get

mentally prepared for the rest of
the matches during the week. It
was West Liberty who first fell to
these ”fresh” Panthers. '
The Pitt tennis team's resident
supergirl, Tracy Feltingoff had a
mild scare in the No. 1 slot Wed-
nesday. Playing at the top of her
game, she cruised to a 6-3 win in
the first set. Her opponent,
however, was not about to roll
over and die as she lost her serv-
ice game and was defeated 6-1 in
the second set. But, in the true
Panther spirit, Feltingoff jumped
right back into the match to come
away with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 victory.
Fortunately, things were a bit
sweeter for No. 2 Carrie deVer—
ra. After struggling in her first few
matches, deVerra came out
smokin’ with a 6-3, 6-1 victory
over Shani Bogers. In reviewing
her performances in the last few
weeks, she acknowledged that
her game ‘is ’’finally’’ getting
together. Her victories for the day
were not over, though, as she
teamed up with Gwen McIntyre

down the middle.”

0 West Virginia's defense was
able to get a lot of pressure on Pitt
quarterback‘ Sal Genilla, forcing
the Panthers to stick to the run-
ning of Craig ”Ironhead” Hey-
ward and Adam Walker.

Genilla completed only seven
of 18 passes for 72 yards.

The Mountaineers sacked

Genilla only twice, but they

forced him to hurry many pass-
es. Pitt offensive tackle Tom Rick-
etts was impressed with West
Virginia's defense. ”They like to
run a lot of stunts on defense, and
you're not too sure where your
man's going. They very rarely

-play you head up and take you

on, but when they do take you
on, you have to be prepare for
that because they're so big and
strong,” he said.

0 Walker continues to boost
the Pitt running game by taking
some of the load off Heyward. In
the game, Walker carried eight
times for 54 yards, including a
33-yard run early in the fourth
quarter which set up a VanHorne

field goal attempt that was wide

left.

0 The 6-3 final was Pitt's lowest
two-team total since 1957 when
the Panthers defeated Orego_n,

7 6-3, on the road.

0 Mark Stepnoski, Pitt's All-

. America candidate offensive line-

man, sat out the game with an an-
kle injury which he sustained in
the Brigham Young game and
which has since been aggravated.

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried said
he hopes to get Stepnoski back in
the line—up for the Boston College
game Saturday night at Pitt Stadi-
um (7 p.m. EST).

to easily wrap up the No. 1 dou-
bles match for the Panthers;
And if tennis were a marathon,
we could all look to our own
Bonnie Kartzman for guidance.

Known for playing long and_

spirited matches with a burning
determination to fight to the
end,Wednesday’s match was no
different. Dropping the first set,
6-3, it might have looked, to an
average bystander, that the match
was out of her hands. Sure
enough, in the second and third
sets, Kartzman turned on that ex-
tra bit she needed to win and did
so'by taking the second set by an
impressive 6-1 count. The last set
was a real test of endurance, but
she proved capable of taking the

match, 3-6, 6-1, 7-6, 7-4.
Playing behind Kartzman is
No. 4 Gwen Mclntyre. And, sur-
prisingly enough, some of these
Kartzman-like attributes must
have rubbed off on the young
freshman as she came back from
a 5-1 hole in the first set to wrap
up the match, 7-5, 6-2.
Pittsburgh's other freshman,
Sharon Jaffe, was paired up
against West Liberty_’s Lori Smith.
Still suffering from a minor foot
injury, Jaffe took the court and
defeated her opponent, 6-2, 6-0.
Sporting a two match winning
streak, the pressure was on for
No. 6 Sandy Hunt to perform.
Hunt confidently took the court
and downed her opponent, 6-1,

6-2, for her third consecutive win.  H’
Hunt later added that her excep- ;

tionally strong net game-allowed
her to control the key points in
the match. .

With their impressive sweep in l I

the singles matches, Pitt also took
two out of the three doubles
matches to round out the 8-1 win.

Completing what Coach
George Dieffenbach called one
of the toughest weeks of the sea-
son, the team went 3-1. With this
rough spot out of the way and the

additional confidence gained by . -

the victories, the team is heading
into midseason and preparing for
the Big East Tournament in mid-
October.

Soccer team loses and Luxbacher fumes

 i

_By Vince Carey

Staff Writer

After three consecutive losses,
the Pitt soccer team saw its record
drop below .500 (3-4). Two
straight 2-0 road losses (to Buck-
nell and West Virginia) were fol-
lowed up by a 2-1 double
overtime home loss to Ohio State
Saturday afternoon.

”About seven or eight of our

‘guys played hard,” said Pitt head

coach Joe Luxbacher. ’’It was a

‘poor effort by the rest. Our mid-
-_ field was nonexistent, and the,

score showed it.”

V Pitt started the game strong.
They pushed the ball down the

a‘ field and-up to the net. A num-

ber of shots were taken, but none
could get past the Buckeye
goaltender. Then with less than
one minute gone in the game,
Pitt's Dave Moss took a shot that

was just about to go in, but Ohio-
,.State’s Don Patko jumped to his
I left and deflected it away.

”We had hoped to start off the
game faster,” said Ohio State

head coach Gary Avedikian:

”We didn’t react defensively like
we should have; as a result they
had a number of chances.”

The game continued to" be
dominated by Pitt, but they still
couldn.’j.t~;«-;,~j_solve the Buckeye

'defens'ef:’;At this point in the

game,'iihe' Panthers looked like

. they would blow Ohio State off

the field," but they could not put
the ball ‘into the net.

The Buckeyes tried to mount
some type of offensive attack, but
were turned away by the stellar
play of the Pitt defense combined
with the big play of Mark Hen-
dricks in goal.

Finally with about six minutes
left in the first half, Moss was able
to take advantage of a crash in the
middle of the field and put the
ball in. Pitt led 1-0.

’’I think we played well,” said i

Pitt's Jon Ascher. ”Ohio State
played the same type of control
game that WVU did. It gave us
time to react.”

The rest of the first half was a
purely defensive battle. Each
team would move down the field
only to be turned away in the
end. The half ended with Pitt
grasping on to a one-goal l_ead.

”At halftime, we made some
key changes,” said Avedikian.
”We knew that the second half
would decide our future, and
judging by the way that we
played in. the first half, it didn’t
look too bright. We played some
players out of position,.and it
worked out.”

The second half started out
completely opposite of the first
half. Ohio State controlled the
ball, as the Panther offense com-
pletely disappeared. They moved

, down the field and into the net,

but each time, Pitt held. Yet there
was a feeling of doom app'_roach-
ing, as Pitt had more and more
trouble keeping OSU out.
Then with about 36 minutes
left in the_second half, the Buck-

The game was now tied at one.

said Hendricks. ”Our,defensejust

could not get the ball past the
50-yard line. But they still
couldn't get the ball past Hen-
dricks, so it remained deadlocked
at one.

With 17 minutes to go, Ohio
State tried to capitalize on a free
kick. Buckeye Todd Young

kicked the ball straight into the’

net, butthe goal was disallowed
because it had not touched
another player on the way in.

, This was the last real threat that
either team had, and the game
moved into overtime tied at one.

”Both teams played well in the

second half,’’ said Avedikian.

”We kept up the pressure, but
their defense was strong. This
was the most aggressive we have
played this season, so I'm
satisfied.”

When the first overtime started,
the Pitt offense suddenly came

back to life. They moved the ball -

down the field well, but they just
couldn't put that little extra on the

BWS

ball that would make it go into
the net. This lasted for about six
minutes. Then with no warning,
the Panthers decided not‘ to play
offense and to concentrate on
their defensive play. The game
now moved into a second OT.

Ohio State continued to control
the ball in the second extra set.
Then with a little over two
minutes gone, Buckeye Pierre
Bigby scored the go—ahead goal.
Pitt tried to gain some kind of
ground but just couldn't pull it
off. Ohio State celebrated as the
buzzer went off, walking off with
a 2-1 win.

”Some changes will be made
before the next game,” said Lux-
bacher. ”A few of the.upperclass-
men seem to think that their jobs
are safe, when they aren't. If we
are going to lose these tight
games, we are going to lose them
with people who want to play.”

Pitt has a 10-day layoff before
their next game, Oct. 7 against
Canisius College at Pitt Stadium.

Lady Panther volleyball
recaptures Big East lead

during Pitt Invitational  

By Kelley Butt

Staff Writer

The Lady Panther volleyball
team is putting some punch be-
hind the claim ”Pitt is it” this
season.

In spite of losses to Purdue and I

Nebraska that cost the Lady Pan-
thers a spot among the national
rankings, Pitt bounced back into
the winning form more quickly
than their opponents expected.
Now 13-2 on the season, Pitt is
coming off a five—game win
streak. Pitt's victories came at the
expense of top—notch Big East
rival Georgetown, Duquensne,

. Robert Morris, Indiana State and

Villanova. 1
Wednesday night, Pitt played
host to arch-rival Georgetown.
Although a national ranking
wasn't riding on the outcome, it

was an important test of strength.

for both teams. Prior to game
time, the Lady Panthers and the
Hoyas were tied for first place in
Big East play. It seemed that
Georgetown, and not Provi-
dence, would be the team to beat
this year.

The Lady Panthers, trying to
continue their dominance of Big
East volleyball, convincingly

   

defeated the Hoyas in three
games (15-8, 15-2 and 15-6). Pitt
is now 3-0 in conference play
and rests alone at the top of the
Big East heap.

According to Coach Shelton
Collier the team played ”some of
the best volleyball of the year”
against Georgetown.

Cross—town rivals Duquesne
and Robert Morris provided
”tune-up” matches for the Lady
Panthers Thursday night.

‘Pitt beat Duquesne 15-3, 15-3
before shutting them out 15-0 in
the final match. The Colonials
met with a similar fate falling

9-15, 6-15 and 10-15 tothe Lady

Panthers. ‘ -

Usually, power player Denise
‘Frawley leads the teams with
kills; however, it was newcomer
Niki Holmes’ turn in these
games. Playing in only her se-
cond game as a Panther, Holmes
led Pitt with 17 kills in: the three
game match. '

Friday night, Pitt played host in
their own invitational to Indiana
State and Villanova. Indiana State
was next in line to fall to the
victory—hungry Lady Panthers. Pitt
again wonithe game in three
matches 15-8, 15-5 and 15-5.
This win set up Saturday's final

match with Big East rival Vil-
lanovaf ,

Traditionally a strong team, the
Wildcats didn't make an impres-
sionon the stronger Panthers. Pitt
rolled over the Wildcats in three
quick matches 15-2, 15-5 and
15-1 . The final match was played
entirely by the Lady Panther
secondary team.

It seems that a lot of people are
taking notice of the Lady Panthers
this season. Collier noted, ”Many
people who are watching us play
are saying this is the best Pitt
volleyball they have ever seen.”

Pitt has season goals that
they've yet to realize. Collier
said, ”My goal was to be 14-1
and nationally ranked at this
time, but we're 13-2 and-playing
well. That's acceptable for now’?

Collier also noted, ”Our suc-
cess is one of the best kept secrets
around the area. It's a shame that
a team this exciting does not get
the promotion or coverage it

deserves.” Denise Frawley spikes her opponent.
