Clinic Plan Accepted

For over a half-million infer-
tile American women, artiﬁcial
insemination has been a new
hope in bearing 2 offspring.
Magee-Women’s . Hospital in
Oakland will soon offer “test
tube baby” clinic of its own.

The hospital‘s board of trus-
tees unanimously accepted the
plan, which is estimated at a cost
of $4,500-5,000.

The clinic will be the second of »

its type in Pennsylvania——thef

other is at the University of Pen-
nsylvania in Philadelphia.

Dr. Paul Zarutskie will head r

the clinic at Magee-Women’s.
In the insemination proce-
dure, doctorsextract an egg from
a women’s body and is fertilized
in a petri dish. The fertilized egg
is then reimplanted in her uterus.
The clinic will begin screening
prospective patients immedia-
tely. Patients must meet a
number of requirements; they
must be married, and they must
agree to a previous review of
their medical fertility evaluation
and a mandatory conference
with Dr. Zarutskie. All other

‘attempts to impregnate must

have been unsuccessful.

Concert Scheduled

The New Pittsburgh Chamber
Orchestra will present its fourth
‘and final concert of this season
on Friday, March 25, at 8 p.m. in
Synod Hall, 125 N. Craig St.

The orchestra will perform the
following program: Sinfonie in
A major by C.P.E. Bach, Diver-
timento for String Orchestra by
Bela Bartok, and Serenade for
Violin, Percussion and Strings
by Leonard Bernstein.

Tickets are $3 for students and
senior citizens and $6 for all
others.

Most students have very little
knowledge about Pitt's history;
how it was chartered, activities
that went on in the past and fa-
mous alumni are just not known
to today's students.

Pitt's archives at Hillman
Library contain an abundance of
materials about the university
and its past. Files, books, docu-
ments, films, scrapbooks and
master‘s theses are all available
to students and faculty to look
through and learn about Pitt‘s
history.

Pitt was once known as Pitts-
burgh Academy and was located
in Old Allegheny, Pa., which is
known as the North Side. Its
buildings were at the location of
Observatory Hill. The academy’s
move to Oakland took place in
the fall of I908.

In the l880s, Samuel Langley,
a professor of astronomy and
director of the Allegheny

Archives House Pitt Traditions

Observatory, experimented with

principles of flight, which later
resulted in the first heavier-than-
air-craft flight. He also estab-
lished astronomy as a science.

In 1895, Oakland's Carnegie
Library opened as the first insti-
tution of Pittsburgh’s cultural
center. The library doors opened
on a festive day to the music of
Stousa‘s band. “A Bicycle Built
for Two," “Sweet Marie,“ “The
Band Played On” and other pop-
ular tunes of the day filled the air.
That same year, Pitt became a
co-ed university.

Pitt's first female students
were Stella Mathilde Stein and
her sister Margaret Stein. They
entered the university in I895
and graduated in I898. Stella
Stein became the first alumni
president in I900. .

At a student and alumni lead-
ers’ meeting in 1909, the Panther
was chosen as Pitt’s mascot. It
had an ancient heraldic standing
and was chosen because it was

Board Approves  
Clubs’ Budget

By PAUL CORREA

The Student Government Board‘

_(SGB) heard—-and passed—the
budgets of 27 student organization
in last week's meeting.

Pitt News advertisements were
once again the center of controversy.
Masada requested $1,159 in Pitt
News ads for its Masada Forum Ser-
ies, Middle East Simulation Games,

. Masada Newsletter and Israel Week

programs. The Allocations Com-
mittee recommended that $336 be
funded for the ads for these
programs.

Board member Jeff Schaffer said,
“Many Pitt News ads are being cut
because student organizations are
not taking advantage of the SGB’s
Gestetner printing machine."
Schaffer added that the Gestetener
service does not cost the organiza-
tions anything to use.

James Shelton, chairman of the
Allocations Committee, said, “We
felt that the ads we gave them were
sufficient for advertisement
purposes."

Masada requested $14,401 in its .

budget. The Allocations Committee
recommended that $5,895 be
approved, $3,017 be deferred and
$5,488 be denied.

Zachary Grayson, spokesman for '

Masada, had a few other problems
with the budget. Masada requested
$320 for -general mailing, and the
Allocations Committee requested
that this request be denied. “We are
requesting some funding for mailing
to make people aware of the Israel
Week planning sessions and for
Israel Week itself,” Grayson said.

“In this case we felt it was not
necessary to fund general mailing,
after all they have general meetings
where they [Masada] could distrib-
ute information and inform
members of upcoming events,” Shel-
ton said. He added that Masada
receives funding from outside the
university and could use those funds
in any manner it chooses.

“We are currently running .at a
deficit of about $1,600, which we
have to make up from outside sour-
ces,” Grayson said.

A Concerning Masada’s newsletter,
Grayson said that he would like to
see it printed at Typecraft Printers at
a cost of $2,976. The Allocations

‘ Committee recommended that it be

printed on the Gestetner printer-—at
no cost. ' ‘

Emergency Phones

New students at Pitt may not
know what function the bright
orange poles
“EMERGENCY” serve, but they
should becomefamiliar with these
colorful posts because one day they
could make the difference between
life and.... '

The ﬂuorescent poles are called

“emergency telephones” and allow

direct contact between an individual
and the campus police with the press
of a lever.

indigenous to the Pittsburgh
area. A

The close approximation of its
color to the old gold of the uni-
versity‘s colors made it easily
adaptable for decoration. No
other college or university had
the panther as its mascot at the
time.

On March l, 1940, Pitt cele-
brated its one hundred and fifty-
third birthday, Charter Day, at
Stephen Foster Memorial.
Alumnus Fred Kelly, of the
dancing Kellys, was one of the

evening‘s speakers was Mayor
Scully, a I904 Law School
graduate.

A less festive event in the '40s
was a memorial service given for
the men and women who lost
their lives in World War II. The
service was held on Nov. I2,
1944, in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing.’s Commons Room.

The ‘S05 gave the archives

blaring the word,

According to Walt Waters, assist-
ant director of Public Safety, the
phones are here for student protec-
tion and assistance in everyday cam-
pus living. He stressed the
importance of student awareness of
the emergency telephone system.

“We sometimes take for granted
that everyone knows about the
phones, but we have to remember
that we get new students every year,"
Waters said.

He added that in times of emer-
gency most people do not have time
to look for a pay phone to contact
the police.

“When a call comes into the sta-
tion [from the emergency phones], it
is dispatched within one minute,"
Waters said, “and depending on the
nature of the call, vehicles can
respond in three to four minutes.”

Most students reported that whe-
never they used the phones, the
police did respond within a four
minute time period. However, Van-
gie Dafﬁn, who recently used one of
the phones, gave a different time
estimate.

“When I locked my keys and I.D.
in David Lawrence Auditorium one
night, the police were there in 10
minutes," she said.

“Situations like this are also a part
of the emergency phone service,”
Waters said.

The police can be a great help if a
student or professor needs to gain
access to a building once it is closed,
he said. “If the student has a legiti-
mate request, he only has to pick up
one of the phones for assistance."

The emergency phone operating
procedures are quite simple-some
phones only require the press of a
button. Once the phone is lifted, the
call is immediately connected with
the campus police station located in
the basement of Forbes Quadrangle.

Some of the more sophisticated
phones are wired into a computer

Q, Profile: Dr. William Cassidy,Professor and Explorer

£1.

Editors Note: A meteorite found by
William S. Cassidy (who is subject
of today’s proﬁle) has been verified
to be the first identified moon frag-
ment ever found on earth. Cassidy
found the rock on his expedition to
Antarctica in January 1982. The
National Science Foundation and
Space Administration, in Houston
announced the verification of the
rock last Thursday.

By CHARLIE DINSDALE

There is a Pitt facul-ty member

‘who travels thousands of miles to

play with rocks—moon rocks.

Dr. William Cassidy, a geologist,
has been travelling to Antarctica for
the past seven years to explore and
collect meteors that have fallen
there. This year, Cassidy made head-
lines when" he returned with one
meteorite that may prove to be from
the moon and another one possibly
from Mars. All the_ data is not in yet.

Testing is still being done at the

Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The study of meteorites, Cassidy
said, is useful to our understanding

of the solar system and the forma-
-tion of the planets. The deepest sam-
ple of earth which scientists are able
to examine is about five miles into
the earth's crust.

“The great significance of meteor-
ites is that we can study other planets
without having to go to them,” Cas-
sidy explained. “Even the meteorite
from the moon, a place humans have

visited and sampled, can give us -

information that complements the
information gleaned from the
Apollo missions.”

Cassidy, born in New York City in
1928, began to see geologically inter-
esting things when, as a boy, he trav-
elled through the country with his
parents.

“I seemed to have a natural incli-
nation for geology," he said.

versity of New Mexico at Albu-
querque where he received a B.S. in
geology. He then went to Penn State
and earned a Ph.D. in geochemistry.
At Pitt, he is a professor in the geol-
ogy and planetary science
department.

He is the principal investigator in
the expeditions to Antarctica. On
his most, recent trip, he was accom-
panied by nine other people, the
largest group to date.

Those who go with him are usu-
ally senior meteorite researchers and
a crevasse expert. A crevasse expert
is a person especially suited to recog-
nize a crevasse in the terrain where
there appears to be a mere dip in the
snow cover, Cassidy explained.

Expeditions take place during the
Antarctica summer, which runs
from December to January. Because
of the earth's tilt, the sun never sets
o-n .Cassidy’s explorations.

' The expeditions party leaves
southern New Zealand in a C-I30-'
plane and lands at McMurd*o Sta-

tion, a U.S. base 800 miles north of
the South Pole. McMurdo, how-
ever, is not a military base—-an inter-
national agreement stipulates that.

McMurdo, Cassidy said, is some-
thing like a frontier town. Dirt roads
lead to the small town with five
saloons and a population of about
l,00O people—this includes 200
scientists and various Navy
personnel.

In the early expeditions, investi-
gative teams searching for meteor-

ites tended to stumble upon them,

according to Cassidy. One time, he
said, a Japanese team found a clus-
ter of meteorites in one area.

The meteorites Cassidy ﬁnds are
sent to the Johnson Space Center to
undergo tests.

Cassidy said that the information
collected from meteorite findings
like his will change geology in the
next five years. i

“We are going to see studies like
comparative pla-netology added," he

said. “We are going to see a change
in the way we view the origin and
evolution of the solar system as a
result of the meteorite finds.”

Theories surrounding the origin
of life will also be affected.

Some of the meteorites that have
been found are thought to be survi-
vors of the accretion of the original
primordial cloud, according to Cas-
sidy. That means that within them
are complex organic molecules
including amino acids, the building
blocks of protein. This suggests,
Cassidy said, the possibility that life
existed before the earth did.

This theory not only suggests that

there may be life elsewhere, accord- »

ing to Cassidy, but that it could be
carbon-based, as on earth. He added
that this is all based on speculation
built around one sampl'e——ou-r solar
system.

Cassidy -said he intendsto return
next season to Antarctica to con-
tinue his explorations.—his part in
the search for the origins of life.

Pitt Student Organization Budgets Approved

. continued from page one

Masada-Forum Series and one half-
page ad‘ for Israel Week. Board
members Dan Leoce and Jeff Del-
montage cast the dissenting votes.
The . Pitt Dance Ensembe
requested $2,890. The Allocations
Committee recommended that $156
be approved, $810 be held in escrow,
$923 be deferred and $1,000 be

denied.

‘ The $1,000 that was denied was to
have paid for two dance ensemble
instructors. ' _

“Our policy states that we can't

' fund for coaches, instructors, advis-
ers or university employees,” Shel- ‘

ton said. '

According to a dance ensemble
spokeswoman, the instructors teach
modern, ballet and jazz dance. She

» added that without the instructors,
the Pitt Dance Ensemble probably
-would not survive.

‘ Board member Jeff Schaffer
asked, “Do you think that someone
within the university would be wil-
ling to instruct without pay?” The
spokeswoman replied that up to this
point, they had not been able to find
anyone. »

The vote on the dance ensemble
resulted in a tie. In a tie, the presi-
dent, Mark Downs, is allowed to
vote. Downs voted to accept the
budget as recommended by the A110-
cations Committee.

Hand-in-Hand requested $5,149
in its budget. The Allocations Com-
mittee recommended that $3,553 be
funded, $50 be held in escrow, $749
be deferred and $796 be denied.

According to Mark Drnach, coor- .

dinator of this year’s Hand-in-Hand
Festival, the only problem with the
budget. was that they would rather
have their program printed at Cen-

. tralVPrinting—-at a cost of $350-—'

rather than through the Gestetner
service. .,

SGB voted to pass the Hand-in-
Hand budget as recommended by
the Allocations Committee. Again,
Downs had to vote to break a tie
vote. _

about parties, mixers and sock
hop events along with other spe-

wasn’t a sock hop, there was usu-

In 1956, Sigma Chi and Kappa
Kappa Gamma won first place at
the Spring Carnival for their
show and show front entitled
“Midsummer Night’s Dream.“

Near the end of the ’50s, Pitt
set up student dormitories. In
1957, Pitt housed 275 men and
107 women. By 1960, six build-
ings accomodated 1,036 stu-
dents, and plans were being
made, to house more.

1959 brought Pitt a promising
football season and exciting
headlines. “Panthers Edged

Panthers, 28-13" and “Panthers

the school paper. _ _
In 1960, there was a tuition
increase to $28 a credit. It was the
sixth tuition increase since 1932
when tuition was $10 a credit.
That was also the year John F.

' [

Greek
Wars

The battle is still raging. In the latest skirmish,
residents of Bellefield St. in Oakland appeared at a
hearing before the eity’s Zoning Board of Adjustment
to oppose a request by Pitt’s Triangle fraternity for
permission to upgrade its Bellefield St. property.

Reports of the event brought to light some ‘surpris-
ingly bad behavior on the part of both sides of the
dispute.

The Bellefield area residents came armed only with
more of the same old complaints about fraternities
disrupting the neighborhood. A number of questions
ought to be asked regarding this kind of testimony at a
zoning board hearing.

First, is personal behavior relevant in any way to the
issues at hand? The question before the zoning board
was whether Triangle could expand its house, not
whether it could remain there. Preventing Triangle
from building an addition would be the wrong way to
administer punishment for unruliness.

Second, are strained relationships between fraterni-
ties and their neighbors the fault of the fraternities
alone? There are larger concentrations of “non-Greek”
college students in South Oakland than of fraternity
members in the Bellefield-Shadyside area. Why are no
complaints heard from South Oakland residents? Per-
haps because fraternities are more ea_sily identified as
scapegoats. " '

Mention was also made at the hearing of the good
relationship between Triangle, and its immediate
neighbors, while residents farther down Bellefield
complained of the futility of attempts to communicate
with fraternity members. This kind of discrepancy
indicates that part of the blame for bad communica-

= tions rests with the “civilian” residents.

Triangle, on the other hand, deserves some criticism
as well. Pitt chapter president Jeff Tatarzyn noted his
fraternity’s recent attempts to upgrade its building but
appears to have disregarded a more pressing need-
that of “putting their house in order” in a different

_way. ‘ '

I 'First—'~if the neighbors’ complaints are accurate——
there is no valid justification for disturbing the peace.
Pitt students (and employees) must share Oakland
with residents who have nothing to do with the
university. _ ,_

Second, whether or not Triangle’s neighbors have
reason to complain, -the long-standing tradition of bad
feeling between Pitt fraternities and their neighbors is
inexcusable. Granted, part of that problem may be the
fault of the area residents; nonetheless, it would seem
to be in the interest of fraternites to patch those rela-
tionships quickly.

Pitt is working to ease the strains between fraterni-
ties and their neighbors by moving fraternities to‘
‘on-campus‘ liousing——somewhat like separating fight-
ing cats. But just like cats, Pitt can-not keep students
and area residents separated all the time. The contest-
ants in this on-going battle should pull in their claws
and work to eliminate the reasons for fighting.

Letters To The Editor
The Law Of The Land  

Dear Editor:

In an article written in the March
9 issue by Dana Reed regarding the
recent lobbying trip to Washington,
D.C., there were several issues need-
ing further elaboration.

0 The Solomon Amendment-
Thisamendment passed both the
House and Senate by an overwhelm-
ing majority. Yet there is still a vocal
minority that refuses to accept the
decision of our elected legislatures.
The bill proposes, that for college
students to receive ﬁnancial aid,
they must first show proof that they
have obeyed the law by registering
for the draft.

BombsAndBr-otherly Love ‘

Dear Editor:

In a time when everyone is speak-
ing of nuclear disarmament and a
policy of brotherly love, I cannot
share the same thoughts. I think that
it is both unrealistic and foolish to
hope that such ends could be real-
ized. Why? For one thing, the Soviet
Union is not going to go along with
such an idea. even if they have
agreed to talk about it. Without the
cooperation ofthe Soviet Union, the
United States would be put in a posi-
tion that endangers \ its own
existence.

A. wther reason why disarmament
would be foolish is that even if the
Soviet Union and other countries in
the nuclear family were to disarm,
terrorist groups around the world
(who would not agree to disarm on
the grounds that they do not have
nuclear weapons) would be in a posi-
tion of great power. It has been
known for a long time that there is
enough technology that could pro-
vide terrorist groups with a way to
produce a simple, low-cost nuclear
weapon. So the people who would,
in the end, have all the power would
be ti.‘-. terrorist groups.

Wha‘ I propose is that the United
States should revamp old weapons
instead of trying to create new, more
advanced ones. It has become
increasingly evident that the degree
of reliability of our weapons systems
is not nearly asihigh as it should be. I
can not see creating new weapons
systems while older systems are—-

"E a'la'|’n.|—\Aa A v1vw«.w.vvI.v v.4\,U.w,a,.- . a_.. .,.t,. ..,,.--_«- -»,.,»,.,,» ., . ..

If the government is willing to
dish out the hard-earned cash of true
American taxpayers for the sole pur-
pose of educating students who can-
not afford to pay tuition themselves,

the least these self-proclaimed “stu-

dent activists” can do is obey the law
of the land and do what any true
red—blooded American would do:
register for the draft. After all,
haven’t we learned from our mis-

takes during the '60s.

0 Thirty students out of a campus
of 30,000! This is an outrage. Does
this indicate the students’ state of
apathy here at Pitt. Is it apathy? Or
is it that they just realize that no_
Congressman or Senator would take

contrary to government claims—
unreliable and inaccurate.

So what I propose is, in fact, rea-
sonable and logical. It doesn't mat-
ter whether we can blow up the
world 20 times over or 50 times over.
But if we waste money creating new
weapons systems that are probably
as inaccurate and unreliable as the
old ones, what is the use? It is proba-
bly just as safe to leave the nuclear
weapons just as they are as it is to
takejthem all apart.

Better yet. if we are truly con-
cerned only with our own safety and
not being the aggressor in a nuclear
exchange, instead of creating
nuclear weapons, we should be
creating a weapon to destroy the

them seriously. After all, most stu-
dents are too busy getting drunk
every night to bother reading a
newspaper.

0 Another proposal that is coming
under fire is the requirement that 40
percent of the tuition be put up front
before the student is eligible for any
grants. What is wrong with working
for at least part of your education?
After all, you are the one benefiting
from it. There are some who would
like to see the government give them
a free ride; this is nothing more than
socialism. If you want it, earn it.

Name Withheld
I Upon Request

enemy‘s missiles if they are fired at
us. It is only logical that if we are, in
fact, non-aggressive, we should
build a weapon that is truly only
defensive. -Furthermore, if we have
the technology to ‘put a man on the
moon and make a nuclear missile
accurate to within 20 feet, then we
should be smart enough to design a
weapon that could destroy attacking
missiles. Considering the billions
that we spend on nuclear armament,
this should be easy. So what I pro-
pose is truly modest.

Theft At Hillman

Dear Editor:

I saw the Feb. 23 letter complain-
ing about theft at the Hillman
Library. Probably a lot of it is done
by Pitt students themselves, not by
outsiders. Students should have
enough sense to guard their valua-
bles; and if they don’t have enough
sense. what are they doing in college
in the first place?

Also, I think that use of the Hill-
man Library by non-students has

been greatly exaggerated by that
anonymous letter writer. Since non-
students can‘t take out books, the
greatest motive for use of the library
isn't present for them.

I should add that, occasionally,
non-students are granted permission
to use the facilities at Hillman. One
time I even saw Congressman Wil-
liam Covne there.

Panther Spikers Hope To Weath

By MARK A. SINDLER

They call this the calm before the
storm. its a deceiving thing to expe-
rience. lt’s just like being caught in
the eye of a tornado or watching a
sheet—smooth ocean become part of
a raging hurricane within hours,
complete with 20-foot waves.

For the Panther volleyball squad,
calm is pretty much the current
trend. The team has recently come
off a clean-sweep weekend against
Duquesne, Robert Morris and Edin-
boro. The storm arrives Tuesday
evening, when _Pitt must face Penn
State. The match is in Happy Valley,
against a nationally-ranked power-
house. It is a match that could deter-
mine whether Pitt is worthy of
advancing through post-season
play. ' _

First thing first, though. Coach
Ray Reilly scheduled the round-_
robin tournament several weeks ago

Over Clarion
By  STRICKLAND

The Lady Panther gymnastic
team completed their I982-83 sea-
son by defeating Clarion Saturday.
Pitt overshadowed Clarion, l67.95 -
l65.65.

The Lady Panthers had a strong
start on vault scoring—a total of
43.0. Babbie Flock took first place
with a score of 9. l 5 on a pike Tsuka-
hara vault. Gretchen Spiech and’
Karen Martin both scored a respect-
able 8.75, contributing to the vault-
ing total.

On the uneven bars, Martin cap-
tured first with a career high score of
9.25. Flock followed in second place
with a score of 9.15, also a career
high. Junior Eve Singer also con-
tributed to the Panther's total in the
unevens bv executing a fine routine.

After a fine team performance on
the unevens, the Lady Panthers con-
tinued to show their strength on the
balance beam. Freshman ~ Jackie
Calderone, performing an excellent
routine, was able to capture first
place with a season high score of8.8.
Martin took second with a score of
8.5, and a clean routine by Spiech
earned her a score of 8.2. Other con-
tributers on the beam included
Flock, Stacy Constien and Sara
Strickland. ' ' ,

In the floor exercise, Flock took

second place with a score of8.6, Cal-
derone with an 8.45 and Spiech with
an 8.45. In the all-around, Flock
took first place with a total score of
35.25. Martin followed closely
behind, taking second place with a
total of 35.l. Calderone was third in
the all-around, followed by Spiech.

Flock and Martin were able to
qualify for the Eastern regionals to
be held this coming weekend at West
Virginia.

“It was one of our better meets,“
coach Donna Sanft said. “We per-
formed strongly in each event and it
was one of our best performances on
beam.

“Although the season was
discouraging because of injuries. l
feel we ended on a good note. This
meet was one of our higher team
totals."

so the Dukes and Colonials could
get some playing time. This is the
first season for each team.

What both teams got was a lesson

' on how to play power volleyball.

The Panthers easily dispatched
Duquesne l5-9, 15-6. Against the
Colonials, Pitt reigned effortlessly,
l5-7, l5_-6. The possibility ofcoming
out of the tournament with no game
losses died when Pitt faced Edin-
boro. Final scores: 5-l5, l5-6, 15-3
and 15-2.

Reilly basked in the sunshine ofa
four-match winning streak. “It was a
good day," he said. “The competi-
tion wasn’t that strong until we got
to Edinboro.

“I started four freshmen, a sopho-
more and ajunior against Duquesne
and Robert Morris; they got a lot of
playing time and it let them work on

things we’ve been doing in practice.”

In those first two matches, Reilly
utilized his recently-found 6-2
offense—an offense that employs
three hitters up front constantly with
two setters rotating after each serve.
The traditional .5-1' was used in the
final match against Edinboro.

With senior Dave Baird setting
the 5-1, Pitt will defend that four-
match winning streak against the
Nittany Lions in a 7 p.m. start in Rec
Hall. Pitt last lost to Rutgers-
Newark in a road game on Feb. 26.

According to Reilly, the players at ’

least are in the right state of mind.
They know what they are up against
Tuesday. It will be Pitt’s first match
against a formidable competitor
since _the Rutgers defeat.

“The attitude is great against

—-Page 9

The Pitt News, Monday March‘2l, 1983

Penn State,” Reilly said. “Every-
body knows what he has to d0...play
hard and make as few mistakes as

. possible."

The Panthers have already faced
coach Tom Tait’s squad once
before—the Nittany Lions had to
struggle through five games before
finally beating Pitt in a consolation
game during the Pitt Invitational on
Feb. 13. .

After seeing quite a bit of Penn

G ymnasts Preparing For Post-Season  

Panthers  
Flipped By
Ohio St.

By DAVID ic. RITZ

The Panther Gymanstics team

may have ended its dual season with -

a loss to Ohio State this past.Satur-
day night; but the season may not be
over altogether.

Junior Dave Smith has qualified
for NCAA Championships, and
many of his teammates are on the
verge of joining him.

“We have so many possibilities,"
coach Frank D‘Amico said. “So
many of our guys are on the out-
skirts of making nationals. We may
have more people there individually
than an entire team." ’

The Panthers were defeated by the
Buckeyes 276.45-261.95. The Buck-
eyes, a traditional Midwestern
power, ‘is presently ranked inthe top

10 and earlier this season defeated .

top ranked Penn State.

But D‘Amico was not pleased -4

with the Panthers’ last home perfor-
mance of the year—he believed the
l2-3 squad could have achieved
more.

Even with the off-track perfor-
mance, there were several highlights
of the night. Smith won the floor
exercise with a score of 9.45. His
consistency all season may have also
earned him bids in both the high bar
and vaulting events. .

. Senior Mike Lloyd must have
known Saturday would be his last
chance to prove himself at home; he
made the most of every second ofhis
routine. Although he took third
place with a score of 9.45, he broke
the old school record, previously set
at 9.2

“With Mike's last score, it looks
pretty good that he will qualify for
nationals," D‘Amico said.

According to D‘Amico, Chris
Femiani. normally one ofthe Panth-
ers‘ most consistent performers, just
wasn't himself Saturday—he was
better. ‘ ’ ‘

“Chris was exuberant,” D‘Amico
said of Femiani's ﬁnale. “It just

wasn't him out there. There were '

three times that I thought for sure
that he wasn't going to land on his
feet, but he did."

Competing in the all-around for
one of the first times all year, Femi-

Killshot

Goldberg Sets Aside Shoulder To Complete Tournament

By BARRY ZASLOFF

It was a costly wish. Dave
Goldberg wanted so badly for
the recent Pitt Intramural Rac-
quetball Tournament to be com-
pleted, that he exchanged a shot
at winnning the championship.
This was one that would be
decided on the court, rather than

after a year’s worth of specula- -

tion.‘ Or so it seemed.

Goldberg weeded his way
through the preliminary matches
and advanced to the finals. In the

‘ back of hismind lay the fact that

six of the last eight of these tour-
naments were never finished. On
his shoulder rested a partial sep-
eration. And in his way was T.R.
Neiman.

I’  0 5

A The Pitt News, Monday March 21, 1983

Still, Goldberg envisioned vic-
tory. He saw a solid backhand
and wicked foreha d overcom-
ing medical SCI ‘rice.’ His
shredded shoulder was just a
slight obstacle in the path to the
championship. He could fight
the injury with pure racquetball
talent. '

It never happened. Goldberg
lost in three straight games to
Neiman, after which he would
blame his cerebral activity,
rather than his shoulder.

“I missed many easy shots, but
myopponent played smart and
took advantage of every oppor-
tunity that he had," Goldberg
said. “I kept trying to establish
my backhand and wouldn’t
admit it wasn’t working well.
When he hit the ball to my back-

hand I tried for'winners. I hit
passing shots rather than lob the
ball off the ceiling. The ball just
skipped off my racquet.”

It was a match that could’ve
been rescheduled. Goldberg
refused, for he had seen enough
cancellations to last a lifetime.
He had tinkered with the tourna-

- ment title too many before. It
was a calculated gamble.

“I wanted a shot at winning
one,” Goldberg said. “All the
cancellations were in the back of
my mind. Before, no intramural
staff person followed up to see if
the matches were played. This
year they were.”

With a defeat wrapped around
his neck (and shoulder), Gold-

berg had no second thoughts. He
would do the same again, even if
another loss was inevitable. Even
if he had to face the same
opponent.

“I still wouldn’t ask for it to be
cancelled, because there’s no
guarantees the injury would heal
by the end of the term,” Gold-
berg said. “And he just played
smarter than I did. He kept it to
my backhand when he saw I
wasn’t able to handle, that shot..
He was able to hustle more than I

was.

The injury. It had happened
through hustle, and it had pre-
vented him from doing the same
during the tournament. It was in
a private club on a court with
glass walls.

. _

“It was a- close game," Gold-
berg recalled. “I was going after a
shot and forgot where I was. I
went shoulder first into the back
glass wall.”

It wasn’t exactly the thud
heard around the world of rac-
quetball. Goldberg treats the
game as a hobby, as an enjoyable
way to pass time and get some
exercise. He has no intentions or
pretensions of being a profes-_
sional player. '

His brother, Kenny, is one of
the finest racquetball players in
the area, maybe in the country.
David is content with-being one
of the best at Pitt.

“I’d like to be able to perform
at a highly competitive level,"
Goldberg said. “But one with no
interest nor not enough talent to
be a pro.”

What happens when the Gold-

berg brothers hook up?

“He gets a few,” said Kenny.
“Dave has a lot of natural ability.
If he would have put effort in the
game, he would’ve been one of
the better players in the area.

“Sometimes it's a matter of
mind over matter," Kenny said
of David’s playing injured in the
tournament. “You don’t realize

that playing hurt can’t heal the 
injury. I wouldn't have played. . . "Y

What the Panther tennis team
currently needs is time-—enough

time to develop its skills in order to

survive a schedule of 13 matches
within a month's time. Such was evi-
dent this weekend as Pitt suffered
crushing defeats in the hands of
Penn State and Bucknell by the
scores of 9-0 and 7-2, respectively,
before coming_ back to defeat
Lycoming 7-2 yesterday.

“We have to develop the talent we

have,” Coach George Dieffenbach
said. “We showed signs of
potential.”

Dieffenbach was particularly
pleased with the play of the top three
singles players. No. 1 James McDo-
nald was 2-1 this weekend, taking a
beating from Penn State’s Virgil

Both D.J. Mariano and Larry

match when he played aggressively.“

Starting the season off with Penn
State wasn’t the best choice for the
Panthers; the Nittany Lions have
already played l4 matches so far, In
a tour of the South, in which Penn
State faced four top 20 schools, they
went 3-1 1, but having played against
top caliber schools gives the Nittany
Lions an advantage over Pitt.

“The tour really helped them,”
‘Dieffenbach said. “Right now, they
are in mid-season form.” ,

But Dieffenbach has noticed
marked improvement in his team
over the last two matches, even
though he thought the Panthers

could have pulled out a'win over
Bucknell.

“I was disappointed with the
result of the Bucknell match,” he
said. “If we could have pulled off.
wins in the No. 2 and 3 singles

matches and” the No. 2 doubles
match, we could have won the match
5-4.”

But the long, difficult weekend

ended up with the easy victory yes- _
terd-ay. Most coaches would dread‘

the schedule Pitt has——l3 matches in
27 days-—but Dieffenbach believes
playing matches back-to-back helps.

“That’s the way I want it," he said.
“I can analyze each match and work
with the team so they can use it
immediately."

. One thing -that Dieffenbach would
like to improve is the play of the
lower seeded players. The fourth-,
fifth- and sixth-ranked players had a
combined record of 2-7 this past
weekend. .

“We need to work on the lower
position players,” he said. “We’re
not going to make changes though.
I'm going to work with what I have.”

The absence of junior Frank
I(ratz——as well as the loss of fresh-
man Kevin Garren earlier this
season—was evident Saturday
night. Kratz had a shoulder injury
that limited him to the side horse,
and Garren has been out for the past
six weeks with torn knee ligaments.

“It wasn’t necessarily Frank's
injury that hurt us,” D‘Amico said,
“but with Kevin out as well, I did
have to go with some shaky routines.
I feel that this year’s freshman class
is as strong as any freshman class
I've ever had.”

Another Panther who has a
chance of receiving a bid in floor
exercises, high bar and parallel bars
is freshman Matt Peters.

“Every year, we get better and bet-
