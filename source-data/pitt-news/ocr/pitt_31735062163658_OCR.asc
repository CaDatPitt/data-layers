 Monteverdi’s Opera Scheduled

,,

For Friday,» Saturday Nights _

VENUS AND CUPID in Monteverdi’s opera, I1 Ballo Delle Ingrate,

  

are played byrﬂelene Shifrin Reps and Kurt Yaghjian. The opera

is beingdproduced by University

Theater and Antiqua Players in

Stephen Foster Memorial, February 7 and 8.

By NANCY FUCIIIS; ' _ »
The University Theater_ and the Antiqua Players ar

collaborating on a production of 'Monteverdi’s opera, It Ballo
Delle Ingrate, to be presented in Stephen Foster Memorial at
‘8:30 p.m., February 7 and 3 p.m.__ and 8:30 p.m., February 8.

The ‘opera, ‘which was written ‘in 1608 by the poet Rinuc-

cini and the musician Monteverdi, is a unique Italian ex-

ample of a ballet in the Frenché

style, F1'eely translated by Wil-
liam Kingsley, assistant instruc-
tor of speech and theater arts,
‘It Ballo Delle Ingrate means: The
Masque of the Reluctant Virgins.
According to Kingsley, a masque
was a “kind of entertainment put
on during or after dinner just
before the ball began. The enter-
tainment, including songs, dan-
ces, a little dialogue and scenery,
was not professional; usually
members of the nobility, often
g u e s t s themselves, performed.

,_,J$he participants ‘ended the per-

. p _w

formance by inviting the guests
to’ dance.” I

, Venus Begs Pluto

The introduction to the opera
reveals Venus and Cupid beg-
ging Plutofto release some of the
reluctant virgins to warn the
women of the audience to avoid
a similar fete. The central fea-
ture is the ballet itself, the music
for it based on French models.
After the dances Pluto takes the
major role. '

At the first performance, ac-
cording to theprologue, “every-
body in the audience knew who
the Heartless -Ladies on the
stage were meant to represent
sothat sidelong glances in the
direction of known oﬁenders,
muttered innuendoes, and the
retailing of court scandal took

Effllp-no small part of the assem-

V bled company's attention.” The
ﬁrst American performance took

_ place in 1959 at Town Hall,
New ‘York.’ ~ ’ '

The committee for Greek
Week, which began drafting
plans about three weeks ago and

'which has already announced
the theme of the week, “Greeks

“The week will run from Tues-

Week Breakdown

'In breaking the week down,
Fox noted that it will officially
open with a Greek Sing and.
Queen’s Contest to be held at
’Soldiers and Sailors Memorial

will be sung in either the foreign
vernacular or English.

According to ‘Fox, entries for‘
song selections must be sub-

Mel-Villiams at Midday

‘Nation’ Editor Found.  
Thought Provoking

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

Carey McWilliams gave his
Midday Series audience all the
ideas it could handle Wednesday
in his ﬁfty-minute analysis of the
problems, attitudes, and possible
solutions to the automation crisis
that is revolutionizing modern so-
ciety. , '

McWilliams, editor of.The Na-
tion and .-one of America’s most
respected social critics, called on
Americans to come to terms ‘with
the problems of automation by

_“changing our thinking, by at-

tacking the automation question
not as politics or economics but
as a problem of valueS.” '

He said "it was “absurd” to
think of the problem in terms of
Puritan ethics. He found “in-
escapable: the conclusion that
economic planning is necessary.

Solution Prefaced

The journalist prefaced his brief
remarks on the-solutions to the
“crisis” with a dissection of the
situation as it prevails today. “The
United States is almost totally un-

prominent social critic, urged

MIDDAY SPEAKER Carey Mcwilliams, editor, of The Nation and ‘r
Americans to. grip the problem of ,. .
thinking,’

prepared for the coming automa-
tion crisis.” -
Mcwilliams attributed this to
a “failure of communication” in
which the earliest proponents of
automation used an esoteric
language that no one under-
stood, resulting; in a slow per-
ception by the people.
Also a smoke-screen was inad-.

vertently thrown up to hide the _

functions of automation.

management shrugged it off. There
was a tendency to blame 1ay—ofls
on the recession when it was really
the eifect of automation. The
booming economy of the 1950's

‘cushioned its impact.

Those Hurt Most

And possibly the biggest factor
was that the people who were
hurt most — the Negro, the young
uneducated worker, the unskilled
man over ﬁfty —- were unable to
articulate a significant _political
protest. There was little political

recognition of the problem.

This is the enticement that Dr.
Robert E. Olson, head of Bio-
chemistry and Nutrition, uses to
recruit students of the University
to undergo a four-month research
program in heart disease.

“Dr. Olson explained:

individuals to

done many fat metabolism experi-
ments with rats and rabbits, but
animals don’t react the same as

Asked to Submit Names

Therefore, University students
are asked to volunteer for the
submitting their
names to the student employment
The research staff
then contacts the students and
asks them to visit Presbyterian
Hospital for a series of checkups,
which include_ physicals and a talk
with a psychiatrist. This is done
to insure that the student has no
physical defects which would pre-
vent accurate testing results and
to assure a balanced emotional

After a student has been
screened and selected, he lives
much the same as a dorm stu-
dent, except that he rooms and
boards in a special ward of the
hospital. Participants ‘must not
eat between meals and must not
.eat anywhere except at the
hospital. Drinking water is per-
mitted at any time.

The other deviation from dorm
life is a curfew that varies from
11 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. These sacri-
ﬁces tend to be offset by the lu-
crative $100 a month and payment
by the Public Health Service of

six University credits.
Four Segments

_:l‘he four-month period of test-
-ing is divided into four segments.
During the ﬁrst, the student is al-
lowed to eat much as he always
has done with selection of foods

subject to somerestrictions.

In the second phase a protein
diet begins. For three to five
weeks the studenteats a con-
trolled chemical mixture which
Dr. Olson likened to a gloriﬁed
milkshake. The “milkshake” is
composed of proteins which in
turn are composed of .amino
acids. These amino acids make
up the protein content of a.
molecule excreted by the liver
called a lipid. The lipid is also
composed of fat substance called
cholesterol. -

While former research has con-
cerned itself with lessening the

be established,_ the program
hopes that by cutting down the
protein consumption in the diet,
the cholesterol segment of the I7
lipid will be “starved,” slowing ’
the number of lipid molecules
produced and thereby ‘lessening
the number of molecules releas-

ed into the bloodstream. In this
way the fatty cholesterol, known
to be linked to heart disease,
will be decreased. A The fourth
phase is a repeat of the ﬁrst.

Hope for the expected results is
high. Histories have shown that
alcoholics have a high protein con-
tent and a low cholesterol read-
ing. Non-alcoholics tend to have a
lower protein content and a higher _
cholesterol count. ’

_ Another Program

Dr. Olson said that six other
students are in a similar program,
though'- not as extensive. These
students give blood samplings and
eat at the hospital but do not re-‘
ceive room, free-credits, or money;

The present Clinical Research
Unit was established at Presby-
terian Hospital in 1961. The pro-

Health Service of the—University,

Editorial:

As was established in the ﬁrst part of this two part series on
the aims of American higher education, both students and their advisors
and administrators are now guilty of rating the security which an educa-

li tion offers above the more admirable aim of education for the sake of
hknowledge, i.e. pure education. _

' In order to further understand this change of direction and its
> inﬂuence on this campus,  will be advantageous to examine three items
'.'of' interest in this general area. ‘ '
‘ The first is the University’s much criticized Course Distribution
, program. Under this program L.A. students are required to take ﬁve
’ courses in each of three areas of the University — Humanities, Social
' Sciences, and the Natural Sciences. This has been done in order to provide

the student with a balanced education. In spite of himself, one might add.

However, instead of giving the students a background in each of many

understanding of the foolishness of the distribution program as it now
stands. The student tutors are in business to assist those unfortunates
who are forced by the University to take courses in areas quite oustide

their areas of interest. Naturally, the program has been immensely suc-
cessful.

The third item is by far the most ridiculous and is going to do
more to push “pure education” in the background than any distribution
program could ever do. We refer to the new “study improvement” pro-
gram set up by the Dean of Men’s Oﬁice. '

Topics which will come under discussion in~these programs will
range from motivation and reading skills to notetaking and how to take
an examination. To use simpler terms, the program will teach students
how to pass a course without learning "anything. It seems especially de-
signed for this purpose, and it will probably be_ as equally successful as

 ' departments which should, idealistically, serve to whet their appetites for
‘ further study, the program only serves to dish out insigniﬁcient doses
" of material to students who have no interest in 80 per cent of the work.
I The general result is a furthering of the “success” principle instead of a

dissolving of it.

The second item to be considered is the tutoring program spon-
; sored by the freshman honorary, Phi Eta Sigma. This program shows an -,

the tutoring program.

The desire for knowledge is something that can never be acquired
by talking about it, nor. does the word “study” have anything to do with

“education,” but until peoplerealize this simple fact and throw out these

V remain a pretty.

. The civil rights movement
throughout most of the country,
‘including the fair city of Pitts-

pete for these jobs are under-

white workers. Recent riots at

It is no accident that the

groups in America, the Negroes

receive the poorest education.

Unemployment statistics tell

the story. The nation wide per-

centage of non-whites unem-
ployed is exactly twice that of
whites.

‘In New York city, the Public
Assistance recipients in the
ﬁfties included 31% whites, 40%
Negroes, and 29% Puerto Ricans.
As long as there will be unem-
ployment, Negroes will be over-
represented a m o n g the unem-
ployed..This would be_ trueeven
if discrimination were eliminated

becausethe Negroes are poor,

and poverty today is self-per-
petuating. An elimination of pov-
erty and the whole culture en-
gendered by poverty is thus a
prerequisite to the equality en-
visioned by the civil rights
movement.

Thanks to -automation, an eli-
mination of poverty is possible.
As Michael Harrington says, all
that we lack is the political will.
A society without poverty is hard
to imagine; we’ve never had one
before. But that is what is in-
volved in thecivil rights move-
ment.-

The civil rights‘movement,'
in every way, is big stuff.
Right now in the South, Ne-
gro voters are being registered.
Since the Southern conserva-
'tive's power rest on the disen-
franchisement of the Negro,
once white supremacy is de-
feated t h e Republican-South
‘e r n democrat conservative
coalition will collapse. Inc the
North, in the big urban centers
groups in the civil rights
mo v e me n t are conducting
drives in voter registration
and voter education. One
doesn't have to be a political
science major to know that
these people aren’t going to be
Goldwater supporters.

The new element in the civil
rights movement now is the de-
termination and size of the
movement and the resulting con-
cern for civil rights on the part
of the rest of American society.
There have been other tangible
gains such as integration of some
schools and other institutions but

The ‘ Gambling   M an  

From the window of -705 Schenley, one

1 could gaze into that palace of aesthetic

pleasure known as Forbes Field. On a
bleak ‘cold Sunday in November, 1962» I

, sat on my bed in that room watching the

Pittsburgh Steelers entertain the Minnesota
Vikings in an -inconsequential National
Football League game. The races in both
divisions had been decided for all practical

A purposes and the teams were just playing

out the season.

I stared out the window transﬁxed,‘

watching the game intensely. Finally, after
what seemed like an incredible length of.
time, the game started to draw to a close.
The Steelers were leading, 32-31, and had
just intercepted -a desperation Minnesota
pass. They started -to run out the clock, or
so I thought. ,With ﬁve seconds left, quart-i
erback Bobby Layne handed off to Dick
Hoak on the Minnesota 18, who skirted
around end for a touchdown. Lou Michaels
added the extra point and the Steelers won,
39-31. Immediately after the game ended,
I threw a chair across theroom, screaming
every epithet I could think of. It was half
an hour before I calmed down.‘ _-
Normally, I .couldn’t have cared less
about the final‘ result. But the situation

wasn’t normal. I had bet Minnesota with .

7% points and had lost my bet in the ﬁnal
seconds. , .

has a team with 71/: points, 'and‘t~he team
loses by 7, he wins his bet and that’s all
that matters. Whether the team wins or
loses the game is, to the better, purely
incidental. ' «

A sizable portion of the University stu-_

dents engage in sports‘ betting. The two
most commonly -bet sports are football and
basketball _-— both collegéiand professional.
They bet- for various reasons —- some for
kicks, some for money primarily, and some
to ﬁll a vacant emotional need. Success in
abetting is hard to achieve, but it is not al-
ways the goal of the better.

To“. be a success _in betting college
basketball, for example, one must know
every possible detail about 145 major col-
legepteams. The better must be able to
predict whether or not a team will be
“up”_ for at particular game. After careful
‘study of the many va,ri‘ables,l the better
wagers. His success or failure, however is
determined on the ‘basketball court.

As most students have seen‘ in The Pitt

News Yogi. duringthe football fseason, it is"
fairly difficult tojpick the winners of_these ,

games. The .bet,tor’s task is increased ten-
fold. Hemust pick the winners with point
‘spreads which_.he receives from his book-
maker. It is hard, but for some people‘ it
must be tried.‘ ‘ " t '

Gambling -on ‘sporti,ng. events is illegal ,
in every state'_bfut Nevada’. Yet, it is a bil-
.1ioI11¥dollar _a year ind._us.

The Warren Commission should,

- if possible, tell us how President

Kennedy was killed, who killed.
him, and why. But beyond that,
it must tell us if the/FBI or any
0 t h e r government intelligence.
agency was in anyway connect-
ed with the alleged assassin, Lee
Harvey Oswald. _At this moment,
the possibility of such associa-
tions in the young man’s life is
intolerably a subject for specula-
tion. ‘ .

One ‘thing. is" ‘clear: the FBI
was in. fairly] close contact ’with
Oswald’s 1 activities. How far
these contacts went is indicated
in “the revelation that the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation tried
to recruit Oswald as an under-
cover informant" in Castro groups
two months before Mr. Kennedy’s
death.”-This report, which ap-
peared in a Philadelphia Inquirer
dispatch from vDallas December
8, went on: -

The FBI_ attempt to recruit
Oswald as an “'i~-nforma~nt, an
info 7- m e d_ law enforcement
source said,'1vas made in Sept-
tember, just after he had moved

»to Dallas f-rom_ New Orleans.

Oswald’s ' m o t h e r said an
"agent named Hosty’? came to’
the Irvinglhouse and talked to
the young man at length in his
car. '

An FBI agent named Hosty
handles investigations of sub-
versives for the Dallas ﬁeld of-
fice. ' _ .

The source said he did "not
know, if the FBI succeeded in
hiring‘ Oswaldyand the federal
agency would not discuss the
‘matter. , _

on January 1, Lonnies Hud-
kins of the Houston Post, pub-
lished a -story under the head-
line: “Oswald Rumored as‘ In-
formant for U.S.,” Hudkins found
that ‘Oswald did. ‘know agent-

Hosty. "He had Hosty’s home

phone, office phone and- car li-

cense ' number -— this on the

authority of William Alexander,
assistant to Henry Wade, Dallas

District Attorney." Alexander had

attended‘ the grilling of Oswald

on November 22 and 23. Hudkins
notes that if the FBI, had Os-
wald under ‘surveillance, the
watch could not have been too
close or they would have known
about’ the riﬂe and other mat-

ters; but, as a sheriff deputy put .

it, “You just wouldn’t think to
check out one of your own
stoolies . . .”

Was the alleged assassin of '

President Kennedy‘ employed. by
the FBI? We have seen a news
report that the agency tried to

fused to say whether he accepted
the offer. ‘ A
If’ there is anything constant
in Oswald’s life, it. is his “need
of money. ‘After three years on
a ‘Marine » private’s pay, he goes
to Russia. There he works in a

factory for the pittance of 80'

rubles a ‘month. He returns to

Was lee Oswald Working for Tire I-"BI?

By Harold Feldman—’The Nation’

Texas unemployment compensa -

l
. tion of $33 a week.

Surely he was a-pauper, a
fellow whose monetary resources
‘could only keep him swinging be-
tween want and destitution. But
if there is another thing about
Lee Oswald as certain as his in-
digence, it is that he was often
capable of expenditures that
would have cramped the purse
of a suburban status seeker.

After years of subsisting on a
Marine’s pay, from which be cc-
casionally sent; money to his
mother, he undertakes a trip to
Russia with a capital of $1,600.
How could hehave put aside this
nest egg? After years of low fac-
tory remuneration in the Soviet
he wants to return to the United
States and, in a letter to his
mother, estimates the cost at $800.
He borrows'$435.71 from the
United States Embassy in Mos-
cow but, mirabile dictu, he’. re-

pays the loan between October,

1962, and January, 1963, during
which time he was unemployed
for several ‘weeks. and worked
for a time‘ as an unskilled de-
veloper of photostatic prints.

A  Pauline -~ Bates, public
’sten_ogr.a"pher,e.?‘whom- Oswald ‘ paid
for typing his notes fora book
about Russia three days after this

return", has said that ‘f‘4he hinted‘

he had gone ;to the ~iSo;v‘iet as a

told her then that “when ‘the
State Department "granted my
visa, they stipulated they could
not stand behind me in any way,”
an admonition ‘suggestive of in-
struction, to an undercover man.
Back in America, as impeeu-
niou/s as ever, heiﬁnds the" money
to rent an olﬁcJ for $30 a month,
where he sets up in business as
the New Orleans Chapter of the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
He buys a rubber stamp, he prints
2,000 leaflets, he pays a $10 court
ﬁne, he buys a riﬂe and telescopic

U."S.,, secret agent.” He" -allegedly‘

 

bled and boresighted -— and in
his room after his arrest the po-
lice ﬁnd $150.

He goes to Mexico City for a
week to get visas for a trip to
Cuba and Russia that would have
cost at least $1,000. (The Cuban
and Russian consulates did not
issue the visas.) After the murder
of the President, the police ﬁnd
in his room, in addition to the
wad of money, “several expen-
sive cameras and rolls of ﬁlm.”

Where did the money come
from? The FBI and the Dallas

police fail to supply information

on the subject. For the Russian
period, we have the unsupported
assertion of Pravda that Oswald
was an American spy who made
numerous contacts with the
American Embassy. This might

indicate‘ a CIA afﬁliation. . He

wrote his mother that, on his're-
turn, he would spend a day or
so in New York and -Washing-
ton for “sightseeing.” After that,
all is dark except for one hint.
An Associated Press dispatch of
November 30 from Dallas says in
part:

-“Someone” telegraphed small
amounts of,money-to Lee Har-
vey Oswaldfor several —/months
before the assassination of Pres-
ident Kennedy, it was reported
today,” the Dallas -Times‘ Her-
ald said. The unidentiﬁed send-
er telegraphed Oswald $10 to
$20 at a time.

Here apparently are’ some of
the Western Union ' items about
which the FBI has been so- see-
retive — but why this secrecy?
If the money came from the Com-
munist Party, it is hard to un-
derstand why the FBI should co-
operate in a Bolshevik plot. If
it came from‘ a right-wing’ or
Fascist source, the FBI could not
lose by revealing it. But if the
money came from a government
-source, then the agency’s reti-
cence is understandable‘ . . .

Michigan omorrowe Afternoon

By FRANK smzix V
Pre—season polls showed the Michigan
wrestlers asthe number three team in the
country. The Panthers have the unenvi-
able task of traveling to.Ann Arbor to-

morrow to meet the powerful Wolverines.‘

The-Panthers will be at full strength with
only one possible change in._ the‘ lineupiwhich
beat West Virginia. Frank O’Korn, who wrestled
at 157 -pounds against the Mountaineers, will try
to get down to 137-’-
pounds for tomorrow’s
match. O’Korn ﬁnish-

_ If O’Korn gets his
weight down, that
means that either Don
Caslow or Clair Riley,
b o t h 137 - pounders,
will wrestle at 167-
pounds. The rest of
the lineup will be Duff
Killian, 123; Mike Johnson, 130; Dino Boni, 137;
Tom Baily, 157; Lee Hall, 177, and Ken Barr,
heavyweight.

The only Panther winner returning from last
year's 14-13 loss to the Wolverines is Johnson.

 

He beat Nick Armelagos, 6-2. Heniff drew with,

Ralph Bahna, 6-6.

Michigan is missing three regulars from last
year’s squad. They are Armelagos, Dave Doze-
man,—who beat Baily at 137-pounds, and Jack

Barden,,who'b’ea't Barr at heavyweight and later

went on to win» the NCAA championship at ‘

191 - pounds.

The Wolverines have already’ defeated Penn ‘

State, 16-11, and are currently the defending Big
Ten champions. They holdfconference wins over
Purdue, Northwester'n,,Il'linois and"Wisco’nsin. V

This is by far the toughest match Peer-y and
his wrestlers have had all season. The Panthers

need toget wins in the lower"-weight classesand 

then come on in the upper two weight divisions.

The Wolverines have exceptional strength in
the middle weights. Lee Dietrick, at 147--pounds,
is a former Pennsylvania High School titilist,

r157-pounder Wayne Miller is a Big Ten runner-

up, and 167-pounder Rick Bay is unbeaten this
season. '

Dietrick beat O’Korn last year, but prob-
ably faces a tougher assignment this season in
Boni.. Miller will be favored .over Baily and
Bay will be an overwhelming choice over Cas-
low or Riley. , V S, ‘

The 123-pound match between Killian and
Bahna looks like a— tossup, .while Johnson
shouldn’t have too much trouble with Bill
Johannensen at 130-pounds. The Cal Jenkins-
O'Korn match at 137-pounds could go either
way. '

Lee Hall, who has improved considerably
over last year, has a good chance of beating
Chris Stowell, who beat him last year, or Joe
Arcure at 177-pounds. The heavyweight match

-between Barrand Bob Spaly could be the de-

ciding bout. ’ -

Track Team After Second Win
At Expense of Slippery Rock

Upping their record over .500 will be the goalof the

Panther trackmen. when they take on Slippery Rock at the
Field House tomorrow at 3 p.m. The Panthers will seek a
repeatpof last year's meet when¢

they slaughtered the
79-45. 1 -

Ironically, the best man on the
Rocket ‘team is Randy Miller, an
ex-Panther. “He dropped out
after an unbeaten freshman sea-
son. ,He’s an excellent quarter
and half—mi1er,” said coach Carl
Rees.
_ ‘Slippery Rock’s other top point
scorers are distance runners Joe
Grande and Fred Lucas, both of
whom‘ won last year.

The Panthers will use ‘the

Rockets,

‘ same lineup that faced Army

and Rutgers.’ Bill Delvecchio
and Mike Slutsky will run the
dashes, Danien Koch, and Don
Hinchberger in the half mile,
and John Bailey, and Bill
Mocnik in the mile.

A DelVecchio will be trying for

his second victory. Others in that

category are hurdler Joe Friend,
broad jumper Luddy Hayden, and

the mile relay team. '

If the.Panthers are successful
Saturday afternoon, they will
equal their indoor season win to-
tal of last year—two. They have
meets .coming up against Navy,
Notre Dame, and Kent State, all
of which have tough teams, so a
victory against the Rockets is vital
to a fair season.

Freshmen Please

Coach g Peterson

With'the season halfway over,
freshman basketball coach Carl

Peterson is pleased with the way’

the team has been improving.
“We -seem to be getting bet-
ter with every'game. The team
is‘. making fewer mistakes, and
this clear thinking has helped us
to win several games that could
have easily been defeats if we
had lost our heads.” .
The freshmen show a 5-2 rec-
ord for the season. One of these
two defeats, however, was at the
hands of Panther junior varsity.
The game was the ﬁrst of the
season, and Peterson was still ex-
perimenting with the team.
Peterson cited Stan Falenski
and Bob McNal1y as the two
standouts on the squad. “They
have been my most consistent

performers all season long.” Fa-.

lenski is currently averaging 19.7
points a game, while McNa1ly has
a 14.7 average. .

The Cubs meet Carnegie Tech
at the Field House tomorrow night
in a preliminary to the Panther-
Carnegie Tech varsity game.

Swimmers Face Rugged Test
Against Maryland Tomorrow

In 5 meeting‘ of the two perennial Eastern collegiate swimming
powers, the Maryland Terrapins visit the Panther swimmers tomor-
row night at 8 p.m. in Trees Hall pool.

Maryland, fresh off a victory over Navy, 48-47, is undefeated this
season. But this Maryland team has more depth than the Navy
meet indicates. ‘

Their freestyle relay team of Lampe, Gilson, Nullmeyer and
Rebillard did a 3:l8.7. Pitt’s record time of last year, which hasn’t
even been approached this year, is 3:23.0. The Panthers will literally
have to concede this race. ' “

The Terrapins will meet the Panthers in their strongest event
with one of the best divers in the country. All-America Ron
Squires will ‘clash head-on with Panther all-American hopeful
Don Hahnfeldt. - ’ .

Carver Says  

Frosh   Sports,

W7ill Co‘ntinue"

Athletic [director Frank

‘Carver said‘ that. Pitt has

no intention‘ of following
Penn State’s lead in cancel-
ling freshman athletics. ’
Last week Ernie McCoy,
Penn State athletic direct-
or, announced that ._.his
school had cancelled fresh-
man football and tempor-
arily halted freshman
basketball and gymnastics
because, of their high costs.
Carver does not believe
that Pitt will follow‘ State.
“One of the reasons their
costs are so high,” Carver
said, “is because of trans-
portation-. We don’t have
that problem since there
are many schools in the
immediate Pittsburgh‘ area
that we can play.” -
Carver _did say, however,
that freshman workouts
may someday be limited to
three days a week. In the
ﬁnal analysis, though,
Carver stated, “It will be
up to the coaches of the
respective sports as to
whether their sport will be
continued on its present
level or reduced some-

- what.”

Cagers Seek 12th
sWin Against Tech  

V _ By ART FLEISCHNER I I

If the Panthers’ game at the Field House tomorrow
night against Carnegie Tech is -as easy for Pitt as Tech
coach Mel Cratsley seems to think, then it will make Pan-
ther -coach Bob Timmons and guard Dink Larkin happy.

After the Westminster game,_won by the Panthers,
71-60, Cratsley,’ noted for his quick and humorous com-
ments quipped, “Pitt looked good tonight. When they hit 100
against us on Saturday, we’re going to quit.” , -

' Larkin, who, tothe disappointment of _the fans Wednesday
night didn’t play, said, “I’d ' _ ‘ .
like to be on the ﬁring line
against Tech.” T i m m o n s. ,
hopes hewill also. ,

Timmons said, “West- '
minster always gives us a
‘good game. These are the
type’ of games that are tough
on a coach. We never got a
comfortable lead and I
couldn’t relax" once.”

Timmons should be
able to relax tomorrow
night. Tech brings a. 5-5
record against the Pan-
thers ll-4 and seven in
a row. If the Panthers
win their eighth in atrow
against the Tartans, it
will be the seventh at
home. p. »

‘ Tech’s attempt to stop the
winning streak will be led
by Ray Morrison. Morrison is the team’s,leading scorer with a
_ 15.3 average‘. "He will be" aided by Jeff Kalin, .the top rebounder,
and Jules Borkowski. The other starters will be Steve Foles and
’ Ray Metz. - _ ’

The iPanther’s close" game with Westminster ‘was typical of
games the last few_ years. Coach Buz Ridl always has ‘a well-
. disciplined team,’ and this year is no» exception. V

The game wasclose until_ Pitt scored eight points in a row
with four minutesleft to take a commanding 13-point lead. ,

V Timmons said, “Wevweren’t sharptonight, ‘na we wereh’t_
vmoving the ball. ‘ Dave Roman wasn't hitting an that makes it
tough for us. In general our defense was good, ‘but when Bob
Orovetz started scoring off Generalovich, I had to switch Dave
Sauer on him.” A «

While Sauer did not do much better than the General
defensively. "Orovetz leading all scorers with 25 points, he
did do 17 points better offensively. He and Cal Sheﬁield
were the APanthers leading scorers with 19 points apiece.
Both _grabbed ten rebounds to lead the team in that
department. ‘ «\ l - ‘ . ,

Rid1(said, “I really thought we would win tonight. We had
the shots, but we wercn’t making them. They’re fast break and
second and third shots killed us. Pitt played good defense and
forced us to make mistakes.” I '

JV Hoop Squad

Dave Blyshak scored 26 points

sity basketball team to a 77-58

  DAIRY  

 

By FRED BERLIN“

Tomorrow marks the start
of anew month, and the Pan-
ther gymnastic team hopes
that it will mean a new start
for them also. Unfortunately,
whereas -they only lost three

meets in January, February will
afford them with ﬁve opportuni-
ties.

The ﬁrst one w111 come tomor-
row at 1:30 p.m. whenthey face
Temple. Last season the Panthers

went down to defeat, 56-40, and '

their chances of reversing that
performance appear to be slim.
With the status of sophomore '
Bob Davies still a question
mark, Coach Warren Neiger will
be hard pressed to strengthen
his slim forces. "

To make matters even worse,’

Davies is not the only one in-'
jured. Another sophomore, Al

‘I , Leonard, hurt himself in _practice

last week and he may be able to
see ‘only limited action. This will

furthercomplicate the problem of’

who can best compete, in what
events.

“I feel that everyone has been
trying! their best,” Neiger stated.

 “We just don’t have enough depth

and there isn’t too much that can
be done about that.” _
In spite of ‘the teams dismal
showing,_ there have been a
' couple of good ‘individual per-
formances. .Neiger -said, _ “Ed
Stim did a real nice routine in
tying for ﬁrst on the side horse
against Army, and John Fran-

 chuk went ahead and got _a

third on the parallel bars even-
though he was sick at the time.”
Even with a few top perform-

ances, however, "the Panthersiwill.

still be. hurting. Under the new
scoring system,_ where every
score" counts," only a_ real team ef-

fort can do much good. "At present _

there doesn’t appear to be enough
boys on the squad to handle that
difﬁcult chore.‘ _
In last year's loss to Temple,
the Panthers ,were able to win
two events.’ Jack Lehner was ﬁrst
in the long horse and Ed Zamec-
nik and Ed Stim tied for ﬁrst in
the parallel bars.’ Lehner and
Zamecnik are gone, while Stim
is back for another season aridwill
be the performer Neiger willbe
counting on the most ‘tomorow.

 On Campus 

(Author of,“I?alI_1/ Round the Flag. Boys!
I and “Barefoot Boy With Check”)

    

THE INNER ‘MAN
College is fun and frolic and fulﬁllment—except for one‘

‘melancholy omission: we don’t get to enjoy Mom’s home

cooking. (In my own undergraduate days, curiously enough, I
did not undergo this deprivation; my mother, a noted cross-
country runner, was never home long enough to cook a meal
until her legs gave outlast Arbor Day.)

But most of us arrive aticollege with fond gastric memories of
Mom’s nourishing delicacies, and we are inclined now and then
to heave great racking sighs as we contemplate the steam
-tables in the campus cafeteria. Take, for an extreme example, -
the case of Finster Sigafoos. - «

Finster, a freshman at one of our great Eastern universities
(Oregon State) came to college accustomed to home cooking of
a kind and quantity enjoyed by very few.. Until entering
college, Finster had lived all his life in Europe, where his father '
was an eminent fugitive from justice. Finster’s mother, a
natural born cook", was mistress of the hauté cuisine of a dozen '
countries, and Finster grew up living and eating in the Con-
tinental manner. .

He arose each morning at ten and breakfasted lightly on ﬁgs,

     

1 >’ ffler was a" mzllffr 

hot chocolate, and brioche.- (It is interesting to note, inciden—
tally, that brioche was named after its inventor, perhaps the
greatest of all French bakers, Jean—Claude Brioche (1634-1921).
M. Brioche, as We all know, also invented croissants, French
toast, and—in «a curious departure-—the electric razor. Other
immortal names in the history of breadstuﬁs are the German,
Otto Pumpernickel "(I509-1848) ' who invented pumpernickel
and thus became known to posterity as The Iron Chancellor;
the two Americans, William Cullen Raisin (1066-1812) and
Walter Rye (1931-1932) who collaborated on the invention of
raisin rye; and, of course, Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875)
who invented Danish pastry). « N

But I digress. Finster, I say, breakfasted lightly at ten am.
At eleven am. his Mom brought him his elevenses. At twelve
she brought him’ his twelveses. At 1:30 she served his lunch:
ﬁrst a cle_a_.r broth; then a ﬁsh course (porgy and bass); then an
omelette; then the main course—either a saddle of lamb, an eye
of sirloin, or a glass _of chicken fat; then a salad of escarole; and

ﬁnally a lemon souiﬂé.

At three p.m.'Mom served Finster low tea, at ﬁve p.m. high
tea, and at ten p.m. dinner—-ﬁrst a. bowl of petite marmite (she
trapped’ the ma-rmites herself) ;. then a ﬁsh course (wounded
trout); then an omelette of turtle eggs; then the main course-
either duck with orange or_a basin of farina; then a salad of
unborn chicory; and ﬁnally a caramel mousse.

And then Finster went off to college, which reminds me of
Marlboro Cigarettes. (Actually it doesn’t remind me of Marl-
boro Cigarettes at all, but the makers of Marlboro pay me to
write this column and they are inclined to get surly if I fail to
mention their product. Mind you, I don’t object to mentioning
their product—no sir, notvone bit. Marlboro’s ﬂavor is ﬂavor-
ful, the ﬁlter ﬁlters, the soft pack is soft, the Flip-Top box ﬂips,
and the tattoo is optional. Marlboros are available wherever
cigarettes are sold in all ﬁfty states of the Union. Next time

you’re in the U.S.A., try 9. pack.)

But I digress. We were speaking of Finster Sigafoos who went
from Continental dining to dormitory feeding. So whenever
you feel sorry for yourself, think of Finster, for it always lifts
the heart to know somebody is worse off than you are.

. ‘ . ' 0 1004 Max Sbulmon '
We, the makers of Marlboro, can't say whether European _ .
food beats ours, but thiswe believe: America’: cigarettes
lead the whole world. And this we further believe: among

‘ America’: cigarelteglllarlboros are the finest,
