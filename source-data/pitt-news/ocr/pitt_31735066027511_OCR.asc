Oakland murder
Man kills neighbor after years-long feud

Anthon Breznican

 

A feud between two South Oakland
neighbors resulted in a grisly
murder/suicide yesterday, as police
found the dismembered body of 44-
year—old Ann Hoover in the abandoned
apartment beside her home.

City police discovered Roy Kirk,
owner of the abandoned home on Lawn
Street, cutting her body apart with a cir-
cular saw and a hand saw in the base-
ment around nine o’clock yesterday
morning.

Neighbors say Kirk was telling the
police to kill him as he was taken from
the home, and en route to the homicide
department in East Liberty he hung
himself in the back of the police van
with his own belt.

Neighbors were shocked at the mur-
der, but said the two had been fighting
for years because Hoover had been
pressuring Kirk to renovate his build-
mg.

Kirk owned the row house next to
Hoover’s for nearly five years, and in
that time their friendly relationship
became a series of arguments and court
cases.

Chris Fromme of 318 Ophelia

 

Street lives behind the two homes on
Lawn Street and said Hoover often
complained that because the homes are
so close together, her building suffered
water damage from Kirk’s leaky roof,
and that his unkempt yard and house
were eyesores and attracted rodents.

“I spoke to her last Thursday, and
she asked if she could take some pic-
tures of his home from the deck on top
of my house,” Fromme said. “They
argued a lot, but for years she tried to
compromise, and even offered to buy
the building from him and fix it herself,
but he just wouldn’t go for it.”

Phillip and Mary Ellen Cossack
lived on the other side of Hoover’s
home and said Kirk had been trying to
repair his home, but didn’t have the
money he needed.

“[Hoover] was always taking him to
court  and the city fined him a lot of
money, about $50,000” said Phillip
Cossack. “All he’d worked for his
whole life was pretty much gone
because of her, and she kept pushing
him.”

Kirk was supposed to appear in
court yesterday after Hoover and sever-
al other neighbors ﬁled a lawsuit against
him for neglecting his property.

When neither of them showed up,

police were called to search Hoover’s
home, according to Pittsburgh Police
Commander Ron Freeman.

“When the officers on the scene dis-
covered she wasn’t in her own home
they decided to search the empty build-
ing next door,” he said. “The door was
open and the officers walked in, and dis-
covered Kirk in the basement cutting
her body into pieces.”

Once discovered, Kirk exploded in
rage and began ﬁghting with police, and

The College of General Studies stu-

things done for the students they represent.

Recently the CGS student government
has been discussing possibilities of restruc-
turing under the FAS student government
board in the form of a governance board.

Before motions are made to proceed
with such an action, every attempt will be
made to gather information and student

CGS council.

student leaders within CGS.

Yet the council was still uncertain
about how to get members to join a com-
mittee to gather information on the matter.

All thought that student opinion
should be addressed, but beyond that
uncertainty was prevalent. Some felt the
history of CGS should be studied.

The policy of SGB on governance
groups and the structure of student govem—
ments at other urban universities were also
avenues of information that members
wanted to consider.

Void caused by societal
racial gap not only
between blacks and whites

“Ali R. Abdullah

Perhaps the most evident gap separat-
ing sections of society today is the racial
gap. Surprisingly, this gap doesn’t just
widen the void between whites and blacks
but also between African Americans them-
selves. This lack of unity stems from a vari-
ety of causes. .

Many African Americans at Pitt,
despite their social or economic status, say
they would like to see more bridges built
across these gaps and are making efforts to
see this is done.

Aisha Anderson, Black Action Society
political—action- chair, says she’s optimistic
about the attempts to bridge the gaps
between African Americans. Anderson says
last month’s African American leadership
conference was a step in the right direction
and did a good job of unifying those who
attended.

Pitt freshman Shavon Ogunleye agrees
that events like the February leadership con-

ference are good, but also says there should

be more opportunities for minorities at Pitt
to socialize.

“I think it’s good that FOCUS has a din-
ner for African American students,” said
Ogunleye. “But I think there should be some
social event for all minority students and we
should come together at least once a
month.”

Ogunleye says many students come
from different backgrounds and are prone to
join cliques when they come to an institution
like Pitt. She says these cliques act as an
obstacle to prevent African Americans from
socializing.

Sean K. Stallings is the chairperson of
BAS’s Black Active Students Intercollegiate
Struggle Committee. His committee orga-
nizes African American student events on
campus as well as at other schools in the
region.

Stallings says students should pull
together if they want to ensure a more suc-
cessful future.

“[African Americans] need to have
unity to be successful in the year 2000,”
Stallings said.

As a member of the gospel choir Some
of God’s Children, Ogunleye directs the
adolescent members of the choir. According
to her, it’s through Some of God’s Children
that people are spiritually led to unify.

“Basically, on campus, I don’t think
religion plays a big role in dividing African
Americans. Some of God’s Children has
helped African Americans of all religions
come together because [it is] nondenornina—
tional,” said Ogunleye.

She says there’s a similar communica-
tion gap between the greater Pittsburgh
community and Pitt students. She says some

 

students feel their only objective is to get an
education, which is too narrow of a focus.

“They just go to class, get their food,
and go to dorm rooms,” said Ogunleye.

Turnout rates at events held for African
American students testify to this with their
low numbers.

“During Black Week, we have lectures
and no one comes. Even for entertaining
events, at times more community members
come out than students,” said Ogunleye.

According to Pitt student Harry Mudd,
many stereotypes are formed from people
watching or reading sensationalized news
sources.

“Everyone gets most of their infonna—
tion from the media. All they see [are]
African American males going to jail for
robbery and murder,” Mudd said.

Pitt sophomore Erika Hollins agrees
with Mudd, but she says the media presents
negative imagery in more ways than only its
method of crime reporting. The portrayal of
African Americans as entertainers, she 
is also problematic.

“I think it’s good to listen to music and
be entertained, but those images shouldn’t
be dominant,” said Hollins. “Otherwise,
people would think that all black people do
is listen to music and act stupid all the time.”

Pitt law professor Robert Harper says
that Americans intentionally don’t want to
focus on important issues which might help
others in need because they would rather be
entertained.

_ “Americans focus on issues like O.J.
[Simpson], not on waning countries, like
Rwanda, or Ethiopia,” said Harper.

Harper says the fallout from this diver-
sion of priorities becomes worse when
viewed along with the exodus of African
Americans from lower—class neighbor-
hoods. He says many times the neighbor-
hood and the people left behind become vic-
tirns.

“There’s a great difference between the
haves and have—nots. Part of the destruction
of our communities is because some blacks
get college degrees and go to live in the sub-
urbs [giving nothing back to the communi-
ty],” Harper said.

African Americans, says Harper, some-
times talk out of both sides of their mouths
and there should be more commitment to
raising up poor African Americans.

One person providing such comrnit—
ment is Georgiana Queen, a social worker at
the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.

She uses her resources to “take back”
communities by counseling them and bring-
ing performance groups into schools. Queen
says more African Americans need to work
toward taking their communities back.

CGS

“just to determine where they are and just
to talk to people and get ideas about how
people do things.”

President Erika Nanz said that the new
committee should be given a list of cate-
gories on areas and concerns to research.
One such area, she stated, would be the
possibility of creating a governance group
dedicated to representing nontraditional
students on campus.

Council member‘ Eric Ondos agreed
and said that suggestions for these cate-
gories should be submitted to the council
in two weeks.

Throughout discussion on the special
committee, Brian Ulery, president of the
graduate student association, advised CGS
council members to concentrate on who
exactly they wanted to represent in the
University.

Ulery emphasized that this should be
the “No. 1 concern” throughout all stages
on information gathering and possible
governmental restructuring.

“When you start to look at the future
of CGS, the first question you should ask
is who you want to represent,” said Ulery.
“Everything else is just superﬂuous. I can’t
make that statement any stronger.”

Many were uncertain about the type of
students that CGS represents and who
would be represented if the government
became a smaller governance group under
SGB.

Most at the meeting said the CGS
council should only represent students
enrolled in that program, but that the coun-
cil has been neglecting them recently.

“As long as we are CGS student gov-
ernment, we represent CGS students, both
nontraditional and traditional,” said
Messineo.

Amelia Joiner, CGS student govem—
ment director of budget and ﬁnance, in
agreeing with Messineo, said, “I think we
have to concentrate on what we are doing
now and focus our energy on areas where
we can trim the fat and improve student
programming in this government.”

Council members unanimously decid-
ed to appoint all ﬁve members of the cur-
rent CGS council to the special committee
created to deal with the restructuring issue.

These members are President Erika
Nanz, Vice President Marjorie Carlson,
and council members Linda Messineo,
Paul Miller, and Eric Ondos.

Also to be included among the list of
appointees are Stephen Grivnow, CGS stu-
dent government judicial affairs director;
Amelia Joiner, and Sheila May—Stein,

director of the First Degree, the CGS stu— .

dent newspaper.

In other business, the council made a
statement concerning the editorial written
by Nena Ansari, a former CGS student
currently in the CAS, which was printed in
The Pitt News last Tuesday.

They said Ansari should not have sub-
mitted her editorial before attending the
CGS council meeting last Monday. By
doing this, council members thought she
failed to incorporate the views and reason-
ing behind the proposed changes within
the CGS student government.

“We suggest that Miss Ansari learns
that one does not make public accusations
unless she believes that she has adequately
researched and considered both sides of an
issue, as well as the facts,” read Carlson
from the statement.

In other action, a majority of the coun-
cil to set aside $1,500 to send up to three
delegates to the United States Student
Association Conference in Washington,
D.C. Money not used would be placed in
the reserve section of the budget.

Many members felt it was important
that nontraditional Pitt students travel to
D.C. to speak with national legislators
about nontraditional student needs in the
form of student loans and welfare recipi-
ents who are forced to choose between
work and a continuing education.

Others agreed it was important for Pitt
to be represented in D.C. but objected to
the trip because of budget constraints.
They said they believed that nontraditional
student needs could be represented just as
effectively right on Pitt’s campus.

“I think it is totally appropriate for
them to go to D.C., but it is just the
money,” said Joiner. “I think if you call up
the city news stations and make a big stink
on campus with organized demonstrations,
you can make a difference right here.”

Leadership

to perform skits for about 45 minutes, and
the kids were well [behaved],” said Queen.
According to Queen, even the roughest kids
out there want structure and discipline, but
in a positive way.

“I believe in positive reinforcement,
and I believe you can use consequences in a
positive way,” Queen said.

But Ogunleye says she tries to unify all
races from a grass—roots level, not only
African Americans.

“First of all, one of the things I try to do
is to say ‘Hi,’ to everyone. I’ve tutored kids
at the YMCA in North Oakland and also
volunteered. We took a few mentally handi-

cap kids around campus to do different
things,” Ogunleye said.

By aiding students with relationship
counseling, Dr. Carla Gary, associate dean
of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is
improving the sum of relations on campus.

“In all of my relationships, I always
want to have a good understanding with oth-
ers,” Gary said.

The act of self—deﬁnition, says Gary,
will improve relations with others because
students will be deﬁning not only who they
are but who they aren’t.

Gary says relationships will improve
only when people learn to “bend but not
break” by compromising with each other.

again and simply think he’s dumb, or so
he tells himself. Maybe he’ll ask about
where to get help, but maybe not.

And if he does, there’s no guarantee
the professor will know where to send
him. And at Pitt, there isn’t anyone
specifically trained to help students
with reading problems.

But if officials at the Learning
Skills Center get enough ﬁnancial sup-
port from the University, that could all
change.

Undergraduate education and retention
According to Georgine Matemiak,
the director of the‘ skills center, her staff
included a reading specialist for 18
years, since 1976, two years after it

THE PITT NEWS

opened. Two years ago, that specialist,
Jane Leevy, took an early retirement
package in which the center paid her 48
percent of her salary for two years.

“We didn’t have enough money to
hire a replacement,” Matemiak said.

In September, the two years of
Leevy’s retirement package ended. Pitt
officials had reduced the budget for stu-
dent affairs, the division that pays for
the skills center, by $250,000. 1

“That money had to come from
salaries, so our money was gone,”
Matemiak said. “We’re trying to find
ways to get those positions back.”

Matemiak said she is confident that,
if she has enough information, people in
high places will listen. ‘

Top officials at Pitt tout the
progress they are making to improve
undergraduate education and retention
rates, something Matemiak hopes to
turn to her advantage. She said a read-
ing specialist can help.

For support, she pointed to a study
of 2.45 million students nationwide
which found that “under-preparation” in
reading is a significant risk factor in
whether a student completes a college
education.

“If we’re really concerned about
retention, then we need to look at read-
ing,” Matemiak said.

The main focus of the program’s
efforts will most likely be undergradu-
ate students who perform well academ-

ically, but who know that their reading
efficiency isn’t what it could be.

“We’re not talking about students
who can’t read, and that’s a perception I
have to be sure people understand,” she
said.

Incoming freshmen at Pitt are tested
for proficiency in algebra and writing,
but not in reading.

“Since students are never tested for
reading, we don’t have data to substan-
tiate that extent of the need, and we also
don’t know to what degree is reading
attributed to any retention problems we
have,” she said. “I feel this is a piece of
the puzzle that we need to find and a to
take look at.”

freshmen at universities nationwide,
42.8 percent said that a “very impor-
tant” reason in deciding to go to college
was to improve reading and study skills.
When students come to the learning
center for help, they indicate their rea-
sons for coming on a list of choices.

Over a ﬁve-year period, an average
of 37 percent marked that inadequate
reading skills were a contributing fac-
tor.

“What we suspect is a need is
there,” Matemiak said. “Obviously,
something’s there, and we need to begin
to develop a program that will go across
a range of skills.”

Reading in context

Jonathan Harris, one of Pitt’s politi-
cal science professors, spends some
time talking with students about how to
approach the assigned readings.

“I want them to teach students how
to read,” Harris said emphatically. “If
they can’t read, they can’t write. If they
can’t do both, how can they pass my
class?”

Matemiak said a reading specialist
would be able to spend some time with
individual students, showing them new
ways to approach their readings in the
contexts of their actual class work.

“The development of skills is usual-
ly much more efﬁcient when students
are taught those skills within the context
of actual classroom skills that they have
to perform,” she said.

Maureen Greenwald, a Pitt history
professor, said she wants the skills cen-
ter to help her students tackle their
assignments.

“Instructors take for granted often
that students can decode and interpret
their reading assignments,” Greenwald
said. “Based on the SAT scores, it seems
to me that many students don’t come to
Pitt with college—level language skills or
a college—level command of English to
read carefully to identify the argument
in their reading and the way that the
author specifically uses the evidence 
and the limitations and particular
insights of different kinds of evidence.

Murder

Freeman said it took four officers to
subdue him.

The Cossacks said the dirty, bare-
foot, and shirtless Kirk was saying “Kill
me, please kill me now!” as the police
escorted him from the building.

“Usually he was pretty clean look-
ing, but I think he was completely out of
his mind at that point,” Phillip Cossack
said.

His hands cuffed behind him, Kirk
was placed in the back of a police van,
but on the way to the station in East
Liberty managed to free the belt on his
pants and hang himself.

“This man wanted to die, and was
determined to kill himself one way or

the other,” Freeman said. “There’s no
way we could have stopped him.”

Though there was only a minor
infraction in Kirk’s criminal record,
Freeman said he had severe mental
problems and had previously spent time
under psychiatric evaluation.

Kirk apparently pulled on his belt
until the buckle slid over to his hands at

which point he undid the belt and pulled

it through the loops.

“Once the belt was free he slipped
the loop through the buckle again and
tied the free end to a steel grating in the
back of the van,” Freeman said. “After
that he just slipped his head through the
loop and leaned forward. His own

 

weight was enough to strangle and kill
him.”

V Though there was a window look-
ing into the back of the van, Freeman
said the officers had no idea or reason to
believe he was killing himself.

“Officers transport thousands of
people a year in those vans and they had
no idea he would do that to himself,”
Freeman said.

The neighbors around that small
South Oakland street overlooking the
Monongahela are still in shock, many
saying they should have seen this vio-
lent climax coming.

“[Hoover] was not the saint that
everyone is making her out to be, and

Kirk is not the monster everyone says
he is,” said Mary Ellen Cossack. “She
hassled him and hassled him, and he
always kept quiet and listened to her.
Now it looks like she pushed him too far
and he finally blew up.”

Fromme said Kirk had always
appeared “kind of off,” but was an oth-
erwise nice person.

“I never thought he would do some-
thing so inhuman,” Fromme said. “No
matter what [Hoover] did to him as far
as arguing goes, what he did to her was
completely unreasonable and horrify-
mg.”

Benjamin Jackson contributed

Reading

“If our admission policies stay the
same, then the curriculum or the ser-
vices available to students have to
address the reading deﬁcits, explicitly
address the reading deﬁcits. The larger
the class, the less likely that students
are assigned papers to demonstrate their
understanding of the assignments.”

Dyslexia and reading disorders

The border between reading skills
problems and reading disabilities prob-
lems, like dyslexia and other learning
disabilities, is a fuzzy area.

Over 600 Pitt students are regis-
tered with disability services, and 80
percent of those students have learning
disabilities, physical disabilities, or
both, according to Marcie Roberts,
director of the center.

The service doesn’t employ anyone
specially trained to help students cope
with dyslexia or other reading disor-
ders. Any help students get comes in
the form of collaboration between the
service, the student, possibly the pro-
fessor, and possibly a referral another

center that the student will have to pay '

for.

This too may change.

The center has grown in the last
few years with the financial support of
the provost’s office. Roberts is now
conducting interviews for a new learn-
ing disability specialist.

“[The LD specialist] will oversee a
developing program to help freshmen
with disabilities get acclimated to Pitt,
and [they will] assist me with what we
already do,” Roberts said.

It would be this LD specialist who
would help students with reading disor-
ders. He or she would not be available
to ‘help students with other reading
problems that aren’t actual disorders.

If any funds for a new reading
specialist to help non-LD students are
to be found, they will probably have to
come in the form of a similar alloca-
tion from the provost.

' THE PITT NEWS Wednesday, March 26, ‘I997

A reading specialist is really needed at Pitt

touts in its brochures, and attract
students of a high caliber.

Not only would a reading skills
specialist improve the caliber of
students attending Pitt, but it would
also improve retention rates, as stu-
dents are able to keep up with their
work and actually learn. If students
can’t get the help they need here,
then they will have to go some-
where else to ﬁnd it.

This University needs to start
building its educational base to pro-
vide the courses and services its
students need. It’s time to bring in a
reading specialist and to start build-
ing a better University.

If you can’t comprehend your

‘ readings, how can you do your

homework? Too many Pitt students

are faced with this question on a

daily basis, and there is no one here
who can help them.

The Learning Skills Center-is
currently conducting interviews for
a new learning disability specialist,
but it has no plans in the immediate
works for a reading specialist to
deal with those students who do not
have learning disabilities but would
like to improve their reading skills.

Students come to the
University of Pittsburgh to get the
best education their money can

 

reading skills. Due to a lack of
funds, no new specialist was hired.

The University had reduced
the student affairs budget which
ﬁnances the Learning Skills Center,
and the position disappeared. The
disservice that this did to students is
not unlike the disservice that the
proposed FAS cuts will do if they

a are carried out.

Pitt needs to stop downsizing
its programs and to start strength-
ening them so that it can provide
the ﬁrst-class education, which it

buy. If students need help develop-
ing reading - skills to meet the
demands of their educations, then
this University should provide such
a service to fulﬁll its mission to
educate.

Georgine Matemiak, the direc-
tor of the Learning Skills Center, is
hopeful that Pitt will increase fund-
ing for the center to include a read-
ing specialist. There was a reading
specialist at the center who retired
two years ago after 18 years of
helping students to improve their

A university is an educational facility, not a business  

 

I am writing to express my strong
disagreement with Provost James

Maher’s recent comments in the
March issue of the Pitt Magazine. He
appears to think that in order to
demonstrate the relevance of this or
any university to the general public
(or, in his words, to “convince
American society we are adding
something essential to the future”), we
have to embrace business as our
model, including, as he says, “a real
change-over to customer orientation
 so that our graduates leave here pre-
pared to do well in American society.”

It is disturbing that the chief aca-
demic leader of a university cannot
articulate the relevance of his school
in the terms of its own mission, that of
education and research, but chooses
instead to abandon the ideals of veri-
tas et virtus in favor of a base appeal
to the bottom line, looking for rele-
vance in a model alien to that of legit-
imate academic interests. He is pro-
moting a vision of the American uni-
versity called “vocationalism,” which
has as its goal the training of young
people so that they can, as he says,
“do well in American society.”

A university, however, is not
essentially a vocational institution. It
is an institution of higher learning, in

THE PITT NEWS

which the pursuit of truth is para-
mount; the goal for its graduates
ought to be not so much that they “do
well,” but that they “do good,” no
matter what career path they choose.
He is telling the graduates of this
institution that they are worth no more
than their paychecks; this is a very
narrow view of “worth.” Indeed, it
amounts to an insult to the large num-
ber of alumni who lead valuable lives
finding fulfillment in pursuits that do
not yield handsome paychecks. This
cramped notion of “worth” is imposed
by the business model, which limits
students to acquiring specific “useful”
skills for immediate economic rea-

sons.
As Eva Brann writes in
“Paradoxes of Education in a

Republic,” this plan is “tantamount to
consigning the young to subservience
and redundancy, for ~‘today’s world’
and its economic situation are precise-
ly what should not determine prepara-
tion. People so trained get stuck in
uncongenial careers that may even
cease to be economically advanta-
geous in ‘tomorrow’s wor1d.”’
Maher, however, seems to
embrace this vocational vision, draw-
ing attention to the fact that he is
“purposely using language that comes
from business.” I would ask why he
(purposely?) leaves out language such
as “the mind,” “liberal arts,” “critical

thinking,” “inquiry,’
ues.”

In contrast with this narrow,voca-
tional vision, consider the views of
Bill Strickland, the founder of the
Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild, Pitt
alumnus, and recent recipient of a
MacArthur Foundation grant, who
was also profiled in the same issue of
the Pitt Magazine:

“This is a time in America when
schools everywhere, especially those
in financial difficulty, are all too ready
to jettison programs in the arts.
Strickland’s philosophy ﬂies in the
face of this contemporary zeitgeist.
His credo is that the arts live at the
center, not the periphery of human
endeavor.”

Endorsing this credo does not,
however, force us to exclude business
and vocations. (Strickland, for exam-
ple, is an artist and entrepreneur.) I do

9

and even “val-

strongly endorse the important train-,

ing that takes place in our profession-
al schools. Nevertheless, a student
who receives vocational training at
the expense of a liberal arts education
becomes a citizen unable to partici-
pate in an informed or critical way in
his or her own civic life. Even if these
students “do well” financially (at least
until society’s needs move on, as they

inevitably will), the students in ques- ~

tion will leave the university
unequipped to “do well” in society

9

from an intellectual or civic or critical
or political or moral perspective -— in
short, from any perspective.

The University appears to be slid-
ing into the sort of morass that the
noted educator (and administrator)
Robert Maynard Hutchins has warned
us about: “As the institution’s love of
money makes it sensitive to every
wave of popular opinion, and as the
popular opinion is that insofar as edu-
cation has any object it is economic,
both the needs of universities and the
sentiments of the public conspire to
degrade the universities into. vocation-
al schools.”

Rather than submit, we need
courage and imagination to overcome

this anti—intellectual and anti-academ— _

ic way of thinking and promote a
vision of education and research that
is more faithful to the intrinsic value
of advancing knowledge, developing
the mind, and enriching the soul,
“commodities” that serve our humani-
ty itself, not just the profits of our
employers. :

I urge those who agree with-this
point of view to speak out, and even
clip out this column and send it in the
campus mail with your own name to
Provost Maher.

Dan Schoos is a guest columnist for.

The Pitt News and a member of the
FAS Graduate Student Association.

Let's all start organizations and get our share of the loot

 

Do you like to have fun? I sure
do. So when I read about the
Student Government Board spend-
ing over $6,000 to have student
leaders to dinner, I wondered how I
(like many of you) was going to
benefit from a select number of my
fellow students hobnobbing with
faculty and University staff so that
they can feel better about them-
selves and build contacts. I’ve been
one of those student leaders; from
what I can recall, that wasn’t one
of the reasons why, I believe, my
two reasons were —-— serving my
fellow students and bettering the
University. Do you think that the
Student Government Board needs a
dinner for this purpose?

I believe that the SGB
Allocations chairperson hit the
problem on the head. Can we say
abuse of power? Don’t be shocked;
it’s not the first time that the rules
have been ignored in Room 639 of
the William Pitt Union. Remember
the computers they purchased for
themselves, overruling the

Allocations recommendation? ' It’s
simply amazing how much faster
they can do e-mail and word pro-
cessing (not that they couldn’t have
gone to a computer lab if they real-
ly had to). SGB field trip? ‘No
problem — they’ve been used to
satisfy everything from board
members’ personal agendas to
exorbitant lobbying trips that have
violated several standard guide-
lines. Care to ask why? Because
they’re the government represent-
ing the students at Pitt («or at least
that’s the SGB response).

SGB also has its own priorities.
They were so busy planning this
event that they forgot about the
rules. Apparently, they also forgot
that there are other issues on cam-
pus on which they should spend
more time (perhaps the possible
cuts in FAS). However, to give
credit where credit is due, this is a
board whose objective went from
obtaining a representative on the
Board of Trustees to merely keep-
ing some student influence in
University decision-making. There
have been some successes, such as
the continuing realization of

PittTV and the Town Hall meet-
ings, but one has to wonder what
exactly is going on in their office
when programs such as the
Internship Seminar are surfacing
again (note: $6,000 spent, 120 stu-
dents in attendance, basically $50 a
head).

What is especially amazing is
that all of this follows on the heels
of SGB’s comments that they
would like to try to fundraise out-
side of the Student Activities Fee
for their programs and ideas. Yet,
after their amazing success with
the start-up funds for PittTV, they
wind up funding a lobbying trip
totaling $1,500 in costs, then ask
for a $6,000 dinner. Are we to gath-
er that there just isn’t the
University support out there for
these programs? If they are so
worthwhile, why?

To some extent, it’s the fault of
us, the students. We leave all that
money in their hands; it’s question-
able whether we can really com-
plain about how they spend it. So,
what can you do to get a piece of
that six grand? Grab nine of your
closest friends who share a com-

- . . . . . . I » . i . » . . . V

mon interest — say pogo-sticking.
Find yourself an adviser, fill out
some paperwork, and you’re basi-
cally set to get a piece of some of
that $6,000. You can get pogo

sticks for all the members of your p

club (providing you can find
University storage space) and bring
in a speaker to teach you how to
pogo better. Perhaps you can even
go on two field trips to pogo cours-
es (yes, there are some out" there).
Look at that —- you’re already on
your way to getting some of that
money. Now, what if people all
over the University were to do the
same? A

We don’t have to "let the money
there be wasted, either by dinners
that don’t help to solve problems or
by clubs that really fund fraternity
formals. All you have to do is what
I said —— and I guarantee you’ll
have more fun spending $6,000
than they will.

SPORTS

Dennis not the
menace all
the time

  

The Academy Awards were
marred by an ugly spectacle Monday
night.

The disaster came during the
opening monologue when a camera
panning the audience happened to
catch a large black man in a purple
outfit with sunglasses and fingernail
polish seated near the stage.

Hello, Dennis Rodman.

Goodbye, any remnants of a dress
code. ‘

When Rodmania hit the Shrine

Auditorium Monday, the power of

sports in the entertainment industry
reached an all—time high. Forget
Rocky, forget Chariots of Fire, forget
“Show me the money” — Rodman is
the true image of sports in Hollywood.
And it all started so innocently:

After a quiet but productive stint
with Detroit and a less—quiet stop in
San Antonio, Mr./Ms. Rodman landed
in the Windy City and began stealing
the spotlight from resident superstars
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.

The Chicago media ate up his
rebounding skills. Soon, everybody
else caught on, and after the team’s
70-win demolition of the NBA and
resulting championship, he put out a
book and went on tour in a dress.

The media and the public ate it up
and had seconds with a side of fries.
Coincidentally, fry advertising is

Panthers clown
cross-town
rival Duquesne

¢_Steve Stonaho

Duquesne visited Trees ﬁeld yesterday afternoon -in
search of another victory over Pitt this season; The
Panthers, however, had a different idea and‘ sent the
Dukes packing after a 12-10 victory.

Pitt came out with a very balanced attack, pounding
out 13 hits. No Pitt player had more than two hits, while
eight of nine starters had at least one. Eight of the nine
starters scored at least one run, as well.

Rob Garvey and Mike Isaac led the Pitt olfense, as
each had two hits and three runs batted in. Each player
had a single and a home run. Garvey scored three runs to
pace the Panthers’ scoring.

Eric Rosing started the game and pitched four and
two-thirds innings, surrendering eight runs on nine hits,
while striking out four and allowing two free passes.

Rosing was replaced in the ﬁfth by Rob Shaffer. The
5-10 senior pitched masterfully, giving up only two runs
on three hits over four innings to eam the win. After get-
ting Rosing out of a jam in the ﬁfth inning, Shaffer
allowed only one more hit, a 1ead—oﬂ° triple in the seventh.

Duquesne had taken the lead after a four—run ﬁfth
inning, but as Shaffer was mowing Dukes down, junior
Mike Isaac was regaining the lead for the Panthers.

With runners on ﬁrst and third and Pitt" down 10-9,
Isaac hammered Duke pitcher Adam Mowery’s delivery
over the left-oenter ﬁeld fence to give the Panthers the
ﬁnal margin of victory.

Garvey proved to be a versatile player in the ninth
inning when Shaffer was in trouble. Head Coach Mark
Jackson decided to move Garvey from ﬁrst base to the
mound. VV1th Dukes on ﬁrst and second and only one out,
Garvey struck out the next two Duquesne hitters with
ease to save the win for Shalfer.

Pitt will strap on their spikes next at Trees ﬁeld this
Thursday for a double header against Georgetown, start-
ing at noon.

 

  

Senior hurler Rob Shaffer notched the victory in Pitt’s
12-10 win.

 

Shippensburg blanks visiting Panthers l4-O

Patrick Robertson

After a 42-0 thrashing of CMU
last weekend, the Pitt men’s rugby
team came back to earth Saturday
with a 14-0 loss at Shippensburg.

The field conditions were poor,
but both teams adjusted well. One
end of the field was a lake, and the
other dry. Rob Mailliard said the
field was “terrible.” It was a cold
day with some flurries, which did
not help the conditions. On a poor
day, it is hard for teams to score.
The low score supports this con-
tention.

Shippensburg jumped out to an
early 7-0 lead in the first half. The
Panthers thought they had tied the
game on I a Mailliard touch.

 
 

Unfortunately, the referees called a
penalty that negated that score. The
apparent touch even came on a
Shippensburg advantage.

The first half was hard—fought.
“It was a very physical game,” said
Sean Tonkin. Both teams played
well and fought for the ball. Pitt
dominated play in the first half,
keeping the ball in Shippensburg’s
end for most of the first half.

Pitt’s forwards played very well
all game, according to Tonkin, and
put a lot of pressure on
Shippensburg. The Red Raiders had
the wind at their backs during the
first half and were able to run under
their kicks very well, said Tonkin.

Shippensburg’s lead swelled to
14-0 on a score early in the second
half. Once again, Pitt thought they

had a score when Tonkin touched
the ball down, but the referees
called a knock-on.

_A knock—on is when a player
fumbles the ball forward and then
touches it down. For football fans, it
is like the Holy Roller of the early
1980s.

Pitt again had control most of
the half but could not put the ball in
the touch zone. “We had a lot of
chances but could not put them
[Shippensburg] away,” said
Mailliard.

Tonkin complimented the Red
Raiders’ strong backs and said,
“they hustled a lot.” This hustle and
strength led to the shutout for the
home team. “It was a pretty even
game, but we should have put them
away,” said Mailliard.

Column

He dyed David Letterman’s hair.
He rode motorcycles with Jay Leno.
He became such a prized media com-
modity that he earned his own televi-
sion show on MTV which can usual-
ly be found somewhere between
“The Real World 25 1/2” and
“Gangsta-Rap Shooting Week in
Review.”

Then, a kick to a photographer’s
ﬂashbulbs and Rodman was sidelined
for nearly three weeks. For a brief
second, it looked like his 15 minutes
of fame were fading out.

Fade in from the ll—game sus-
pension, and movie trailers for
Double Team are showing up every-
where. Five—foot—nothing Jean-
Claude Van Damme is starring with
the hoopster in an action movie sure
to rival Brian Bos_worth’s Stone Cold
for box—office success.

To promote his movie, Rodman
showed up at a World Championship
Wrestling pay-per—view, bringing his
fame to yet another highbrow project.
Apparently, Rodman is a member of
Hulk Hogan’s New World Order
organization — at least that’s what it
says on the $25 T-shirt that the
event’s promoters are currently
hawking.

In short, he’s everywhere. And
with his appearance last evening at
the Oscars, Rodmania has gotten offi-
cially out of hand.

He showed up at the event with
the gorgeous Vivica A. Fox
(Independence Day ), made small
talk with Sigoumey Weaver (Aliens ),
and chit—chatted with Joan Rivers. At
least he’s sticking with the sci-fi
motif.

In Billy Crystal’s opening song
medley, Rodman was jokingly identi-
fied as the father of the mystery
daughter in the best—picture-nominat-
ed Secrets and Lies. The picture
would lose out to The English Patient
for the Oscar. (I’ll admit to missing
both pictures. I understand the win-
ner has something to do with burn
victims. I think it features the Pitt
Panther secondary in a supporting
role.)

After this sideshow, how would
sports be redeemed?

Simple.

Later in the evening, a film enti-
tled When We Were Kings won the
Oscar for best documentary — long
subject. It featured Muhammad Ali
and George Foreman in their fighting
primes, with heavy emphasis on the
Rumble in the Jungle and the Ali-
Frazier masterpieces of the same time
period.

Foreman helped Ali to the stage
after the producers accepted the
award. The crowd welcomed the pair
with a standing ovation.

Both boxers were self-promoters.

 

'l'I-IE PITT NEWS

 

‘FROM PAGE it

Both went to great lengths to be rec-
ognized. Ali even fought renowned
Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki in a
publicity stunt once.

But, both had an ideology to pre-
sent. They used fame to get across
their very different messages, not to
earn their own television shows. For
that, they moved beyond ﬂash—in—the—
pan celebrity status and became
sports legends.

And for all the bizarre things
Rodman may do in the future, that
transition certainly won’t be one of
them.

editor of The Pitt News.

The final results are in, and
Pitt’s women’s track team officially
won the Alabama Relays;

Team scoring at the meet was
based only on performance in the
relay races. Pitt’s women dominat-
ed in that area, scoring victories in
the mile, sprint medley, and shuttle
hurdle relays. Those three wins led

‘I3

Lady Panthers running
away from competition  

Pitt to a total of 40 points at the

Auburn University.

The’ men also had a good meet.
The Panthers’ top finish was a sec-
ond place for the shuttle hurdle
team. Overall, Pitt tied with
Michigan State for sixth as a team
out of over 20 teams represented at
the meet. The 2 winning team,
Meridian Community College,
scored 30 points to Pitt’s 16.

Freshman diver making waves nationally

Malt Townsend

 

 

Last weekend, in Indianapolis at
the NCAA championships, freshman
diver Jamie Tomazich sparkled by
capturing Al1—American honors in
the one—meter dive with an eighth
place. She also placed 13th in the
three—meter.

“It was absolutely incredible,”
said Tomazich. “When I came out
for my awards it made me really
proud._”

Tomazich had no expectations
going into the meet because she
barely qualified for the NCAAs in
the previous Yale qualifying meet.

At Yale she placed third in both the
one— and three—meter. Two third
places wouldn’t have qualified her
for the NCAA, but another diver
double placed higher than her allow-
ing her to move up a spot and on to
the next meet.

“My saying for the meet was that
I had nowhere to go, but up, because
I squeaked in,” said Tomazich.

Her freshman campaign has been
nothing short of amazing. She has
fulfilled her highly—touted high
school reputation in which she was
A1l—American twice and state cham-
pion. Along with her All—American
status this year, she placed in the top
three in the Big East Championships

Wednesday, March 26, 1997

in both diving events. Tomazich is
not done. In April she will compete
in the Senior National Olympic
qualifying meet, an event she has
already competed in twice.

Sophomore Samantha Chabotar
also made the trip to Indianapolis,
but didn’t enjoy the same success as
her teammate. She finished 42nd in
the 500-free with a 4:57.85 and 25th
in the l650—free at a 16:56.

“My times weren’t where I want-
ed them. I wanted to swim better,”
said Chabotar.

Chabotar explained that she has
swam in a number of meets recently
and has been resting a -lot, which has
cut down on her practice time.

Last weekend at the East

Championships, Pitt recorded the
second—best mark for points in
school history with 192.85. The
high marks for the Panthers didn’t
end there as the EAGL announced
their 1997 awards earlier this week.

Robyn Senior was named to the
first team in the vault and ﬂoor
