_ Five nominees for dean of the
College of Artsand Sciences have
been proposed to the Provost's

’ office. i‘
The five names submitted to the
‘Provost. which have not yet been
discussed publicly, were selected

i by a committee of students and
‘ faculty in the College of Arts and
Sciences. The three students and

_" eight faculty,_half selected by the

tive Tuesdays to review the cre-

The committee says temporary

was interested in selecting indi-

Townsend believes that the CAS
dean plays an interesting admin-

of SG’s fight with the administration only students.
in General Studies will be affected by the plan.

John Townsend ‘

I findi_ng support in the faculty and

students for this programs."
Because of the close relation-
ship between the dean and faculty.
Townsend admits. ~"Although_ it
would be tough for a newcomer to
the University. outsiders were

-still‘ included on the candidate

list.“ V

Further weighing the pros-
pects of recruiting a dean from’
outside to bring ‘in new ideas,
Towsend says he consider the Pitt
faculty as innovative as any.

As the CAS ‘dean. an individual
serves as the spokesman for un-
dergraduate education and medi-
ator between scholarly work "and
educational procedures."

The Search Committee for the.

CAS dean sensed that students do
not know how to makeuse of a
lot of programs initiated during
Schneewind’s term. The small
number of students involved with
self_-desinged majors.‘ indepen-
dent terms. and Bachelor of Arts
in Liberal Studies substantiates
,_this‘t'eeling.

Townsend contends then a main

role of the new dean will be to,in- -

form students to take an active
part in these current options to
leaven classroom experiences.

LI°fe—Worl< Pilot Program,

by MICHAEL CLINTON

Life-Work Planning is a new six-eight week program co-sponsor-
ed by the YWCA and the Student Union Board, beginning the week of
May 20 and continuing through the semester.

According to the outline, the pilot program, consisting of 12 to .15
students, was designed on the assumption that many people are rais-
ing some basic questions about their lives and work. or that "circum—
stances have raised questions" for them.

Jack Brown, assistant director of Student Programs, stated that
“the purpose of Life-Work Planning is to help students identify the
direction they want to take, then move in that direction. The goals are
fa. greater self-awareness and aim to provide the students with plan-
ning tools’ necessary to help clarify goals and identify action to take
towards the goals set.

The course will be moderated by two trained professionals from
the Counseling Center. unnamed as yet. According to the outline. the
program is “neither an encounter group nor a crash course in instant
successf‘

The objectives call for analysis and reflection. ending in "con— ’

crete results" towards developing a better awareness of one‘s future

 » plans. To achieve these goals, some of the exercises include picturing

where you have been and where you want to go, analysis of what you
enjoy doing, and the exploration of your skills and interests.

Other exercises include priority setting of the forces for or against

 your goal, decision-making, and planning. Brown stressed that “the
" ” K participating student will get from the program what they put into it.”

The cost of enrollment in Life-Work Planning is $15 per student.

i‘i $10 of which will be subsidized by student activities. More informa-

Co—op Media Comes

By RITA VITOL0

"We're not into it to rip peo-
ple off, but just to show them
how badly they are being ripped
off.“ says Kelly Hall. a Masters
candidate in Mass Communica-
tions at Pitt and one of the dir-
ectors of an organization known
as the Pittsburgh Free Media.

Labelled by Hall as "Ameri-
ca‘s first entertainment co-oper-
ative." the Free Media is "into
presenting multi-artisan concerts.
with the best in artists, the best»
in music. the best in live drama.
and all at. the lowest cost to the
public.“

“You can buy cheaper if you
can buy in bulk,” continued the
Free Media’s co-founder and co-
director, Bill Swazuk. “Co-ops
have been in existence for years-

farmers have milk co-operatives,
there are clothing co-ops—all
kinds. And in each one, the pub-
lic gets a better product at lower
cost.” '

At the present time. the cost
of producing a top-quality rock
concert "anywhere in America”
can run extremely high. "Unless
you're using local talent. the act
itself will cost a lot..James Tay-
lor. for. instance, goes for one
night for about $10,000. Steve
Stills for about $15,000 and Uriah
Heep for about $7500. And it Bob
Hopes your bag, he goes for
about $60.000.

"Besides that. you have to have
high promotional costs for the big
names, plus you have to hire a
hall. Anytime there’s an act com-
ing into the stadium. you know

somebody’s making a pile of mon-
ey off it." Swazuk went on.

According to the Free Media,
that “somebody” who most often
takes the biggest cut is the pro-
moter, the investor of “private
money” who books the act, hires
the hall, and handles the publi-
city. He also sells the tickets.
“Tickets can run as high as d_ou-
ble the cost of production,” by
Hall’s ‘estimate, meaning any-
where from $4.00 to $8.50 or
more.

"We feel that the arts are being
prostituted by promoters," Hall
explained. "And we don't feel
you should make money off some
other people’s talents."

He intends, instead, to use
"public money“ to bring quality
entertainment to Pittsburgh. By
selling a total of five thousand $5
shares of stock in themselves.
Hall and Swazuk intend to raise
$25,000 when they launch a full-
scale membership drive in Sep-
tember. With this investment capi-
tal, they then plan to book twelve
concerts, one a month, in various
locations within the Pittsburgh
area.

Promotion as well as ticket sales
will then be handled through a
monthly newsletter mailed to
shareholders. Stockholders will
be asked to buy their tickets two
months in advance, and will also
be asked to suggest acts and local

-1

talent that might be booked la- -

ter.

The result of all this, according
to Swazuk, is “the cost of the
concert dropping __ to $2-$3, all
seats.” Hall sees the Free Media
as “just co-ordinators. The active

Faculty Grants Awarded 

for Study Abroad

SEVEN John G. Bowman Memorial Faculty Grants for study abroad
were awarded by Pitt's lntercultural Exchange Endowment Fund Com-
mittee. Designed to promote excellence in teaching by faculty study
abroad in fields closely related to their course responsibilities, these
competitive awards are for the 1973-74 academic year.

Grants were made to: Robert F. Copk, French, “Chansons du Ges- ,
te”; Seymour Drescher, history, “Slavery and Race in Britain and
France, T790-l860”; Dan 0. Franklin, music, “The Operas of Rameaul
and Handel: A Study in Performance Practice”; Marcia Landy, Eng-
lish, “The literature of Women” (Germany, France, and Italy); Her-
nando Salazar, pathology, “The Role of Estragens in Intrauterine Con-
traception"; Thomas S. Schorr, anthropology, “Socio-Cultural Change
in the Northern Cauca Valley of Colombia”; Felicisima Serafica, psy-
chology, “A Cross-Cultural Study of Communication Styles" (‘Philli-

pine/American).

Because these awards are made possible by endowed funds they

are expected to be offered each year.

members are entertainers; we send
it out to the public.”

At the moment, the Pittsburgh
Free Media is a non-profit or-
ganization, but if Hall and Swa-

zuk have their way, nobody can

lose. Part of the profit from each
booking will remain with them
as salary, the rest will go back
into the Free Media; the artist.
particularly the local artist,
“gets his exposure” and the pub-
lic gets to go “to a concert, not

a screaming rip-off,” according to V

Swazuk.

The Pittsburgh Free Media has
produced fifteen free concerts in
the last year, including produc-
tions at Pitt, CMU, and Chatham.
Working closely with the YMCA
in Oakland,.the- Free Media has
also produced concerts for the

_Easter Seals Foundation and the

Retarded Childrenl’s Bike—a-Thon,
as well as several concerts for
prisoners in the Allegheny Coun-
ty jail. “The Free Media,” ac-
cording to Hall, is “Pittsburghers
entertaining Pittsburghers, bene-
fitting Pittsburghers.”

Scheduled for‘the weekend of
June 1-3 at the Hunt Armory for
example is the Free Media's 1973
Pittsburgh Communication Ex-
position, a multi-media festival
of “communication styles, aims,
and attitudes.” Hall described
the exposition as Pittsburgh’s
“largest blanket benefit” for com-

‘ munity service organizations. The

organizations include SWITCH-
BOARD, a crisis telephone refer-
rel service; GASP, the Group
Against Smog‘ and Pollution; the
FREE CLINIC, TEEN HOT-LINE,
the NAACP, the HOUSE OF CUL-
TURE, which promotes fine arts
in the Hill District; RAP, Realize

All Potential (a drug rehabilita-_ —
tion center) and the Free Media 
itself. The organizations are in no-
way responsible for the Exposi-

tion, but will receive equal shares
of all profits, the majority of
which will come from admission

fees. , ‘ f.
Designed “to make Pittsburgh-_

ers immediately aware of the
value of communication” the ex-
position will range through every

field of mass and public com- f

munication.

When questioned about a re-
alistic appraisal of the Free Me-

dia’s chances for survival and suc- - A .
cess, Hall replied: “Remember ' 
that anything that is progressive _

is radical and nobody ‘wants to

back a radical. That’s what-the 

Free Media is all about. We want

Pittsburghers to wake up and re- - A
,cognize

the talent
all around them.”

As stories telling of the.Water-
._gate conspiracy developments ap-
},pear in the nation’s newspapers.
fjanother court case remains in the
 shadows here in the city of Pitts-
'bur.gh. '
 Former Chatham Professor
f’Nan.Pendrell initiated this court
action in 1972 following the term-
ination of her contract. In late
April, 1973, Chatham students and
alumni _filed suit in the Federal
Court of Western Pennsylvania
‘against their administration.
charging that the release of Pro-
» ffessor Pendrell was a direct viola-
*tion of their property rights. The
: ‘V 1;’ latest development in the case oc-

 .'_-fcurred last week when the Chat-
 ham Black“Student'Union entered
.d. the case as Amicus Curiae. '
 ' An in depth‘ look at Pendrell’s
 case", shows charges of discrimin-
' ation, (14th Amendment), obstruc-
‘tion of due process of law (Fifth
_ Amendment), and infringement of
the right of free speech (First
f.Amendment). According to Rob-
.e'rt‘= Barr, the _acting president of
,-Chatham, the administration is
. denying those specific charges.

 
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
   
    

as 4-.

_.at the University of Mi_chigan. told
 the Pitt News that the charges re-
lated to her personal case are the
;_violations of free speech and re-
;‘.-fusal‘ of due process of law. She
5, maintains that although she had
.§' ,_re‘ached .the normal retirement
” age, she was fired because she
was an outspoken critic of the ad-
ministration and its policies.

       
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
  
    
   
  

 

 Pendrell“ had appeared on sev-
eral. 'radio programs while in
Pittsburgh, - including talk shows
on WTAE and WJAS and the Car-
iolyn Smith-show on WDVE. Pen-
drell intends to prove in court
 that this was the primary reason
‘ for her sudden retirement.

‘has no'case on that point; He says
that Pendrell was terminated for
-- retirement reasons only, was any
other Chatham professor has been
under normal conditions.

" ‘A close look at the Chatham Col-
lege Faculty Handbook shows
_ ,,that"‘under rare and unusual cir-
" Acumstances”. a faculty member
‘ fmay be reappointed. on a year to
year basis. There can be no ques-
tion. as Barr has said. that Pen-
 drellis a “rare and unusual"_per-
' « son." '

_, But hestipulates that "the clause
 in the handbook does not refer to
I  rare and unusual people, but rare-
, and unusual "circumstances.“ “In

’5* the Pendrell ‘termination the col-
lege was merely following pre-

'_a,Pendrell, currently a professor I

__Barr.has replied that Pendrell

 A Rare, Unusual Case

viously stated policies. said Barr.
“As for the ‘rare and unusual‘
clause in the faculty handbook.
we ought to get rid of it alto-
gether.“

To this point, it would seem
that the administration was mere-
ly following “previously stated

policies.” Although it is unques-

tionable that the retirement as-
pect was the only factor in those
decisions, the facts show that
Pendrell wasn’t hired as a Chat-
ham professor until she was 63.
And then she had been appointed
chairman of the Anthropology De-
partment only three months be-
fore her notification of termina-
tion. It certainly appears that the
college itself had recognized her
ability as a teacher.

_But the case expands to ex-

treme proportio_ns in Pendrell’s -

charge of the refusal of due pro-
cess. As stated by Pendrell. she

was not permitted. on serveral I

occasions. to-appear in person at
the Committee on Promotion and
Tenure to contest her case. Evi-
dently, this is refusal of due pro-
cess. _

Yet the administration claims
that the same procedure was car-

'ried out in Pendrell’s retirement
_case as had been for all‘preced- 3

ing retired faculty members. This
consists of a letter sent to the
faculty member one year before
his 65th birthday. notifying him

. that his contract will be renew-

ed for one more and-final year;

And then one year later, at the
official time of termination, the
professor’s case will be reviewed,
and if there is no subsequent re-
tirement ensues. Apparently,
Pendrell is the only faculty mem-
ber who has contested this proce-
dure and as a,resu_lt, she learned

there is little due process, if any,

in that policy.
Pendrell resolves.
that there has been the same po-
licy for everybody.‘ which is. in
reality, no due process. Now e-
cause nobody has received it in
the past does not mean we shoul
not seek the truth now." '

'Whatever the courts will de-

cide in the next year. it appears ,
that a shakedownand revival of
_Chatham's administration is in or-

der. It~is time for President

. Eddy to come back from Europe

and face the situation his college
is involved in. -a

In the future. the Chatham ad-
ministration cannot take the Pen-
drell matter as lightly as it ap-
pears to be doing now. Refusal of
adequate due process is a serious
offense. Obstruction of freedom
of speech is a serious charge.

"It seems ‘

Column and a Half

by JOHN METCALFE

Many readers and a few writers seem to be
convinced that enough has already been said and
done about the Watergate "caper." They share the
sentiments of certain principals in the affair. that
it is time to leave it alone and hope it will quietly
go away. The fact that this opinion. this creative
apathy. is so widespread. is a sign that we are all
in trouble.

Recent evidence that the creative apathy trend
may have peaked provides a sor-t of hope.

The letters to the editor of the local papers
provide a sampling of opinion, possibly -filtered
through editorial decisions. The Pittsburgh Press.
for instance, has dutifully reported the news events
of Watergate as they became available. Editorials
have appeared which, though tending to be‘sympa-
thetic to the President, were critical of the criminal

aspects of the case. Columns from the entire.

breadth of the conservative spectrum have lament-
ed the distortions of the electoral process and the
erosion of confidence in the executive branch.

. ,. And almost every day there would be letters‘

from the public. Almost without exception they .

expressed a sense that the matterhad been made
too much of. It was time to forget all this and get

- back to business as usual.
Some allowed as how. if the Democrats had '
nothing to hide. they should not mind a little harm- .

less surveillance. This knothead comment comes up
every time the question of personal privacy is rais-

.. ed. I only wish I could furnish a special service to‘
~ those knotheads. I would provide prompt and ac-

curate transcripts of any rumors or malicious state-
ments to the people who are the subjects of them.
I would identify our friends frequently and publicly
by every foolish nickname. however intimate. that
they have ever answered to. And I would show the
world video tapes of their (entirely legitimate)
activities in_both bedroom and bathroom. ~When I
was done. they would finally be eligible to say. “I
have nothing to hide."

There are those who argue that the only thing
new about Watergate is that the spies and thieves

, got caught. Espionage and thievery, they go on,

are natural and necessary to politicsas practiced
in America. Senator Goldwater, among others, en-
courages this notion. Indeed, after Watergate was_
well known, the Senator revealed that he had rea-

' son to .believe -that similar tricks had been played

on him in 1964. ,

Why he waited nine years to mention this is a
mystery. ’ V - _ -

In fact. in the any year but 1973. Goldwater's
revelation would be front page news. In this coun-
try. as some Republicans have recently learned.
concealing knowledge of criminallactivity is itself
a criminal act. A senator admitting to conspiracy!
When cabinet members are indicted. this means .
nothing though. .

There may be a message here for another group
——the idiots who maintain confidently that Kennedy
stole the 1960 election, and Nixon knew it, but did
not mention the fact for fear of casting doubt on

-the Presidency. This would make Mr. Nixon a par-

ty to anvearlier criminal conspiracy even if he“
somehow missed out on the ‘current one.

Richard Nixon is oddly served by his friends.
They have missed their chance. If they had truly
wanted to disarm. demolish and discredit the Dem-
ocratic Party. they should have done the precise
opposite of what they did do. I ‘

If Haldemann. Dean. Hunt. Erlichmann and
all the other hacks and crooks and self-made spies
had. simply abandoned their principles (no diffi-
cult taski and gone to work sincerely and zealously
for McGovern. they could have ruined him forever.
Having men of that caliberon his payroll. or even
acknowledging that he knew them. would have des-
troyed his reputation more surely than any clumsy
forgery or broadcast telephone call.

It is the citizens who find nothing wrong or even
surprising about Watergate who a trouble me,
though. They sound cynical, but I doubt that they are
bright enough for real cynicism. Perhaps they are
themselves defective; incapable of moral or ethi-
cal behaviour. From there, I suppose, they might
proceed to the assumption that anyone, given. the
chance to steal on the large scale, would be as quick
as they to seize the opportunity. They are a blot
on our lives. ' E

Perhaps reservations could be set up forlthem.

where thievery and chicanery would have the force‘

of law as well as of custom. Meanwhile. the rest of
us could go about the business of cleaning, house.

There is an old joke. The first voice asks. “Do
you know thedifference between wallpaper and
toilet paper?" The second voice replies. "No."
"Well. until you do, don't bother visiting me."

I'm afraid this is the model for the people
we’ve had as guests in our White House.

I would prefer to believe that Richard Nixon
had no knowledge of any of the ramifications‘ of

. Watergate. It will be embarassing. of course, to go

through almost four years with a Chief ‘Executive
so stupid and naive that a bunch of low-grade crooks
could keep him hoodwinked for such a ‘long time. I
would certainly be concerned anytime such a man

agreed to proposals made by the wily Chou En Lai .

or the sinister Brezhnev. or even a shrewd peas-

ant like Le Duc Tho. We have had Presidents in the _
past who were stupid. or naive. or both, and sur--

vived them. But we cannot afford a criminal in that

A office.

The thought of impeachment sickens me. It
would cast doubt on ‘every action of .the United

States in at least the‘past four years. But if the A

grounds for impeachment exist, there is no alter-
native. If Nixon condoned the criminal actions of

his underlings, ‘he is unfit to sell soft drinks. much 
V less act in all our names. i ‘-

Credibility is not wounded by reporters or in-
vestigators; it is injured only by facts and actions.

I mentioned a note of hope earlier. Sundays
Press ran several letters ‘on Watergate. They all

‘ recommended cleaning up the mess with soap. not

by kicking it out of sight.

Whether this represents a change in public
opinion‘ or a change in the selection of letters. it is
encouraging. '

‘We can probably‘ survive the whole horrible
mess. The one thing we cant do is ignore it. .

Women's Health Services

Pgh. Abortion ClinicOpens

By DEBBIE POPP

Pat Miller has a.new job car-
r_ying the official title of Direc-
tor of Education for Women's
Health Services. Inc.. which in-
cludes Pittsburgh’s recently oper-
ated abortion clinic.

She is happy about the job and
considers it part of a dream come
true.

- The dream is not Miller’s
alone but one which legions of
women and men have fought to
make a reality. The reality of
this dream is that women now
have the right to control their
reproductive functions.

This right was

finally won

January 22, 1973, when the Su—-

preme Court ruled the restric-
tive abortion laws of Texas and
Georgia unconstitutional.

The court’s ruling held that in
the first trimester of pregnancy
an abortion decision is to be left
to the woman and her physician.
During the next trimester, the
state may notprohibit an abor-
tion but may regulate its prac-
tice in the interest of the wom-
an’s health.

In the final weeks of pregnan-
cy, the state may choose to pro-
tect the potential life of the fe-
tus by prohibiting abortion ex-
cept where necessary to preserve
the life or health of the woman.

The ruling, thus, essentially
ended the legal battle of the
"right to choose" and, opened
another phase of action for this
movement. Dr. Robert Hall.
President of the Association for
the Study of Abortion indicated
the need is now for “fostering
public and professional imple-
mentation of the courts deci-
sion."

, This need has created Mill-
er‘s new job. As Educational
Director of Women‘s Health

Services. Inc. she informs wom-
en of their rights to continue or
terminate a pregnancy and of the
availability of the facilities of
the clinic in downtown Pitts-A
burgh.

Women’s Health Services, Inc.,
as a nonprofit organization, has
opened a free standing abortion
clinic where abortions are per-
formed on an out-patient basis
up to the twelfth week from the

_ last menstrual period.

Pat Educa-
tion for Women’s Health Serv-
ices counsels a caller.

Miller, Director of

“All abortions are performed
by qualified gynecologists us-
ing the vacuum aspiration meth-
od under local anesthesia. This
is considered to be the safest
and most modern method of early
pregnancy termination," stated
Dr. Thomas Bell, medical» dir-
ector of Women Health Services.

_ A woman who thinks she is
pregnant and is considering an

abortion makes her first contact-

with the clinic by telephone.
Volunteers on a 24 hour basis
will talk to the woman to de-
termine the length of the preg-
nancy and give information as
what to wear and expect if she
decides to set up an appoint-
ment. ' ’

When the woman comes for
her appointment. which lasts
three hours. and after paying the
fee of $150.00. she is taken into
a labo_ratory. In the lab. she is
given a blood test to make sure
she is not anemic and to deter-
mine if special medication is
needed for the Rh negative fac-
tor.

The clinic will reject a woman
only if she is over 12_weeks
pregnant or if her hematocrit
count falls under 25.

After the lab work is com-
pleted. the woman is escorted
with three other women into a

comfortable room with cushion-

ed chairs and couches to meet
with a counselor. Here the wom-
en discuss what will happen
during the abortion and how it
feels. Also. at this time, informa-
tion about and the importance
of contraceptives is discussed.
Then. alone with her personal
counselor. -the woman for per-
haps-the first time will be asked
what she cares and thinks about
abortion. Though usually swept
along by events and the judg-
ments of a mother. a boyfriend.
or a husband. the woman. when
treated by the clinic must pause

The counselor will go with the
woman and stay with her in the
procedure room where the abor-

During her stay here, which
averages about 60 minutes. the

for a rise in temperature for a
week. which would indicate in-
fection.

If excessive cramping or bleed-

“Last Tango in Paris," Shoddy, Simplisfic

By DAVE MAJERNIK

Hans Christian Anderson, the
famous Danish storyteller, "wrote
a fable called “The Emperor’s
New Clothes." It is about a king
who commissions a tailor to make
him a new outfit from the finest

_ materials.

The tailor says he will use a
special fiber that can only be
seen by those with “innocence.”

 when the completed garment is
"g,.‘_:‘w_o_1-n’.’ .by the king, it becomes

   
 

Ed Blank of The Pittsburgh
Press said it "has been overprais-
ed, overanticipated. and overin-
terpreted.“ ,

KDKA-TV’s Marie Torre call-
ed it an "important" film. while
Playboy said it is "a powerful
drama" and “first class."

I say that it stinks.

First, there is Marlon Brando
Superstar playing himself. as us-
ual. in his mumbly. dreamy-eyed
fashion.

Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider. Stars of Last Tango In Paris.

Iapparentthat he has nothing on.

But no one dared to say this be-
cause it would be admitting a
lack of insight. Finally, an alert
child shouts: “The king is wear-
ing no clothes!”

George Anderson, of the Pitts-

burgh Post-Gazette wrote that-

Last Tango in Paris playing at
the Manor Theatre in Squirrel
Hill) is f‘a serious, artistic. deep-
ly disturbing, shocking, and un-
questionably sincere film."

Brando plays Paul. a 45-year-
old American. living in Paris.
whose unfaithful wife has just
committed suicide. In his desper-
ation and cynicism. Paul search-
es for a new apartment. While
inspecting an empty apartment.
he meets Jeanne (Maria Schneid-
er). and before long seduces her
in a most brutal manner.

The two agree to continue their
relationship on a‘ day-to-day, sex-

ual basis, without even revealing

their names to each other.

Meanwhile, Paul and Jeanne
separately continue their every-
day lives. Paul makes funeral
arrangements for his wife. en-
counters his mother-in-law and
his wife‘s former lover. Jeanne
frolics with her filmmaker boy-
friend, who is trying to film her
life story for a television docu-
mentary.

Though Jeanne wants to deep-
en her relationship with Brando-

Paul. he stubbornly refuses. and

humiliates her sexually. forcing
her to disavow all middle class
values as "bulIshit.“

Finally, about four days after
first meeting Paul, and shortly
after her boyfriend has asked
her to marry him, Jeanne returns
to Paul’s apartment, only to find
it empty‘, without a trace of him.

Having resigned herself to
Paul‘s exit from her life forever.
she leaves the apartment and
walks across the bridge outside
the building. Suddenly Paul is
beside her.

This time he reveals his iden-
tity and says it is time to begin
a_. new. deeper relationship. But
now Jeanne is not interested.

The two arrive at a night club
where a tango contest is being
held. There they get drunk and
disrupt the contest. Then Paul
proposes marriage to Jeanne.

Jeanne decides she never wants
to see Paul again. and dashes out.
Paul runs after her. following her
all the way home.

I When they arrive at Jeanne's
apartment. Paul is still talking
marriage. Jeanne pulls out her
father's army pistol and shoots
Paul at‘point blank range. That
is the end of Paul and the film.

It is not customary to give
away the ending in a film re-

view. In this case, however, the _

ending is so ridiculous that it
deserves mention. Besides, know-

ing the ending will not take
away from watching this film.

The renowned critics say the
"heavy” philosophical lesson the
film teaches is that Pauls desir-
ed one-dimensional. sexual rela-
tionship with Jeanne is impossi-
ble. In my ignorance of existen-
tial insight and artistic sophisti-
cation. I always thought this
lesson was generally learned by
adolescence.

Also. again in my naivete. I
wondered "why Paul was so des-
perate at the death of his unfaith-
ful -wife. I would interpret such a
situation as a new beginning.
a golden opportunity.

Even granting that there is a
tragedy here, Italian director
Bernardo Bertolucci, did not give
enough support for Paul’s desper-
ation. We see a violently cynical
man, and wonder why.

The weak reasons given such as
his wife‘s betrayal and an un-
happy childhood are not enough.
Perhaps some flashbacks would
have been useful to show the de-
velopment of Paul's cynicism.

Despite frequent sex and vio-
lent emotions, the film is bor-
ing in spots and some of the 130
minutes could have been trim-
med.

The dialogue irregularly alter-
nates between French and Eng-
lish. But most of the film is in
French with subtitles.

The sex scenes are the most
explicit and daring of any major
motion picture yet. with anal
intercourse, frontal n u d i ty.
and some of the most vulgar pro-
fanity. For example. in their first
encounter. Brando tears off Jean-
ne‘s underclothes and violently
makeslove to her in a standing
position.

Brando is clothed during most
of the sex scenes. Delightfully.
though, Maria Schneider is not. '

On the positive side, Bertolu-

Bartolucci——Achieves Technical
Excellence.

cci’s visual composition is out-
standing. There is a sharp con-
trast in the brightness of the out-
doors to the darkness of Paul’s
apartment. Paul is constantly
filmed in the shadows to depict
the darkness of his inner being.

Many of the camera angles are
breathtaking. I particularly liked
a scene where Jeanne and her
boyfriend were seated directly.
in front of a waterfall.

One wonders why the same

. effort to insure technical excel-

lence was not made to improve
the shoddy, simplistic script.

Even with its technical merits,
however, without Marlon Brando
and the sex scenes, Last Tango
In Paris would be one of the 10
least known films of 1973. And
the Manor Theatre could not
then justify its whopping $4.50
admission for _all seats at all
times.

l Colorful  entertaining Productions-

By JOHN sMrrn
Arts Editor
Until June 24 a‘ production of
'Roger’.s —and.Hammerstein's Car-

.ousel is livening up ‘the Play-

house. This fine effort, direct-

‘ ed"by Joseph Nassif. stars _Hal

Robertson.-N as Billy Bigelow and
-Florence Lacey as Julie Jordan._._
"Carousel had its beginnings as a’
play called "Liliom," written in
1908 by Ferenc Bolnar, a Hun-
garian playwrite. In 1943 Rogers
and Hammerstein adapted Bol-
nar‘s script into a smash hit.
Carousel ran from April 1945 to
May 1947 when it first played

New York——a total of 108 weeks. ’

By, now, it has become a classic.
and the Playhouse does it justice.
The story is a simple one. A
young girl falls in love with and
marries a rowdy carnival barker-
Billy Bigelow. Their life to-

’ gether is not necessarily a bliss-

fl one. He has lost his job,‘and
still would rather sow a few wild
oats instead-of, settling down.

Julie becomes pregnant and
Billy decides that his child must

have the best of everything. So.
he and his friend Jigger (David
Emge) hatch a ‘plot to rob a
wealthy mi,_ll—owner. Billy. gets

.caught and decides to kill him-

self rather than go to jail and
then goes to ‘Heaven.

In this Heaven, an offender
can return to earth for one day.
so‘ Billy does“ and sees his daugh-

‘ter—_mu,ch like himself an unhap-
py. dreamy child of 15. '

. But in the end, all the troubles
are reconciled, everyone is happy
and Billy can return to Heaven
with the chorus singing “You’ll
Never Walk Alone.” Worked into
the action‘ are-many hit songs in-

cluding “June is Bustin’ Out All .

Over,” “If I Loved You” and
of course ‘‘You’ll Never Walk
Alone.” '

Granted. the plot is slightly
hokey by today's standards. But
if. you want a thoroughly enter-
taining night at the theatre. Car-
ousel is a treat.

Curtis Collection Features

Theatrical Memorabilia

By EUGENE SANDERS

ll you missedl"The Sin Of PatiMuldoon." it was probably  V I

cause the play ran in 1943 at Cort Theatre in New York City.
But if you’re a Theatre Freak or a Nostalgia Fiend:

All through spring and. summer Hillman Library has the Curtis
Collection in the Special Collections Area on the third floor.

Dr. Curtis. a retired English Professor at Pitt. collected pro-

grams. clippings. pictures. and publications of theatre productions in i ,
Pittsburgh and New York. He donated them to Hillman Library so " 
that people could use them for scholarly work. - * :0

But don’tlet f‘scholarly” scare you away.

Anyone with an eye for art would likethe Art Nouveaujand Art’ ‘
Decco prints on the 1930 playbills. There are also wierd oldads and «

a collection of Burlesque Queen photos!

The collection has almost ev.erything‘there is from the WW I
to WW II which is the Ziegfield Follies. plays like “Ladyx in the
Dark" and "Oklahoma."
and Robert Kingsley.

Of course the collection has information about Pittsburgh thea-':",’.i"
tre history. Some of the collection goes back as far as local theatre 

during the Civil War.

And don't forget to see the 1903 poster, of the Nixon Theatre:
“The World’s Perfect Theatre!" V -

You can also find out why the Pittsburgh Opera House has that  ‘»
name. (Because Americans back in 1910 thought it made theatre

sound less sinful; )

But the biggest part of the collection are the 142 scrap books oil‘

O.P. Merriman. ‘

Merriman was the drama critic for the Pittsburgh Sun Telegraiphf‘ , 
and used to hang out in theatres and con folks into giyinghim mater-'1,
ial for his “morgue”—newsman talk for scrap book. Mei=riman’s”

' books cover Pittsburgh theatre history from 1865 to 1942. ' ‘

One ofthe most interesting things I found in them were me,"
"scenario notes" of burlesque comedians like Billy Hagan. ' -

Hagan used to write down his jokes so he'd be sure to remem-A 

ber them. And these scenario notes are rare. A comedian usually

burned them after a performance so some guy wouldn‘t steal the 

jokes.

There's not enough space left for me to.write up all of what ' 

I saw. You'll have to go over to Hillman and see the collection your-

Slither Injecls a R

By M. C. PILECKI

Film often involves a mixing
of reality and fantasy. Too much
of the former can spell dullness.
an abundance of the latter can
make it unbelievable. Slither,
now at the Squirrel Hill Theatre.
is an odd blending of strange

persons in fantastic situations
behaving very—well. almost-
normally.

James Caan The Godfather,
Brian's Song plays the compara-
tively "straight“ Dick Kanipsia.
An ex—con whose main glory was
in a long-gone high school foot-
ball game. Kanipsia unites with

a trio of near-neurotic characters .,
for’

in the dangerous search
$312,000 of stolen money.

The first character he meets
up with is Kitty Kopetzky (Sally
Kellerman, (Sally Kellerman,
“Hotlips” of ‘M*A*S*H)an over-
aged, pill-popping hippie with
homicidal tendencies. Actually,
there seems to be little reason

-for this character, except per-

haps to provide the requisite sex
and to expand the fantasy almost
beyond its limits. As portrayed
by Kellerman, Kapetzky is just
too hard to take and obnoxious,
and she does not ever establish
what Kanipsia sees in her, be-
yond her availability. '

Peter Boyle Joe, The Candi-
date, plays Barry Fenaka. the
only surviving embezzler of‘ the
$312,000. A small-time entertain-
er ‘(with income to match). Fen-
aka has his head firmly in the
clouds. and no one can really
reach himin his little fantasy
world.

Although his performance is‘

better than adequate. Boyle is

something ‘ of a disappointment
to those who have witnessed his
comic talent. Always a superb

His shy wife Mary is played
by Louise Lasser, a veteran of

sary sanity to the group.

it is certainly scary-looking, it.

is about as hard to conceal or
camouflage as Godzilla, and one
may wonder just‘ why it takes the
“protagonists” so long to dis-
cover its ubiquity.

This is part of the beauty of

the film, that enjoyable mixture,

of the mundane and the whack-
ed-out. Slither has assembled the
klutziest ‘desperadoes since the
Max" Sennott (Keystone Cops;
days.

At first. it seems that every-
thing is smooth and well-oiled.
like - most "suspense" flicks.
(But soon the all too human foi-

As unbelievable and contrived.

as most of the film’s premises
are, the behavior of the charac-
ters’ injects a reality into the
flightiest of fantasies, holding
up a mirror to the dreams of
the everyday. V‘ .

Caan very successfully under-
plays his role as "the "push-
over" inspired to pecuniary
dreams beyond his better judge-
ment. Kanipsia can be takenvas
exceptional only in his “average-
ness,” -and his involvement in
such an extraordinary chain of
events is really more than just
anothersit-com, but a. view of
what can happen when our
dreams get the better of us.

cast the match nationally.

The irrepressible Riggs imme-
diately issued another chal-
lenge to other women players,
particularly the outspoken Billie
Jean King.

But in accepting the winner‘s
check he made a gracious over-
ture to Mrs. Court.

"If the match were played on
another day" under different cir-
cumstances, Margaret might easi-
ly win by the same score." he
said. -

Mrs: Court, who had looked
brilliant in practice, was dis-
traught after her surprising beat-
ingbut said: ‘

"Bobby just played the kind
of game to beat me. Yes, I would
be happy to accept his challenge
to play again."

A crowd of 3.500 made their
way over treacherous mountain
roads to this remote spot in the
San Vincente Valley. site of a
burgeoning real estate develop-
ment.

While her yachtsman husband
babysat with their 14-month-old
son, Danny, on the sidelines, the
statuesque i5-foot-9 Australian
matron, attired in a: lemon and
green tennis dress, strolled onto
the court with an armful of
wooden racquets?

Riggs met her at center court
and handed her a bouquet of red
roses. -

"Do you think this will soften"

her up?” Riggs __said over the
loud speaker.

If the roses didn’t, Riggs, gar-
bage shots certainly did. He
was like a junk ball pitcher as
he fed the tall Australian a shot
variety that completely wrecked
her game. ’

In the first game, he sliced a
couple of soft services at Mrs._
Court and she netted them. Once
he patted a serve into play as a
small child might on a play-
ground and Margaret banged it
down the sideline for a winner.

Riggs proceeded to ’ reel off
three games in a row before Mrs.
Court won the fourth game on

her service, playing one of the)

two good games of the entire‘
match. In that game, she served
powerfully, followed the ball to
the net and put it away.

Once she missed an easy over-
head and banged the racquet
against her head in complete
frustration. '

After losing his first game in
the opening set, Riggs won his
service _at love and took a 5-2
lead. Then he lapsed into some
cute tricks for the audience. He
missed one ball completely when
he attempted a radical underspin
shot and then double-faulted
carelessly, losing his service for
the only time of the match.

By RON SIEGEL

The Pitt baseball team kept their

post-season tournament hopes
alive Saturday by sweeping a
doubleheader from Buffalo State
University. 2-1 and 15-1.

In order to have any shot at
making the NCAA district 11 play-
offs. the Panthers will have to
defeat highly rated Penn State
at University Park today.

Head coach Bobby Lewis
once again relied on his two iron-
men, Bill Shamot and Don Siegle,
to handle the pitching chores.
Siegle pitched a two-hitter in the
first game to pick up his fourth
victory without a loss. Shamot
also allowed just two safeties, and
his record now stands at 3-0.

The Penn State doubleheader

was originally scheduled for Ap-V

ril 28. but like so many games on
the Pitt schedule this season.- it
was rained out. Penn State boasts
a 15-4 record. while Pitt is 10-2.
so whoever comes out on top to-
night should make it to the tourn-
ament.

Penn State has been a frequent

visitor to the NCAA District ll
playoffs. having participated in
them the last three seasons. The
team lost its top 2 hitters and
pitcher to graduation this year.
and although the pitching has
continued to be a strongpoint.
the Nittany Lions just don‘t have
the hitting that they used to. In
a game against Gettysburg. who
Pitt trounced 24-4. Penn State
barely won. squeeking out a 4-3
victory. "That‘s just one game.
They're hitting isn‘t really that
bad.“ said Lewis.

“In order to beat Penn State,
we’ll have to playan errorless
game,” said Lewis, “We’ll have
to cut out all the mental mis-
takes, and I just'h0pe our hit-
ting stays sharp.”

The hitting was quite sharp in
Saturday's games, although the
Panthers were coming off a nine
day layoff due to rainouts.

Pitt scored all the runs it need-
ed in the first inning of each
game. In the opener. Paul Sen-
eca walked to open the game.
and following a fielder‘s choice.
he was doubled home by Scott

Tracks ters Smashing.’

Losers aside, that could prob-

ably be said about everyone con-

nected with the meet.

Penn States visit to the Invita-

one qualified -for the nationals-
that was the 440 yard relay (40.8).

‘Suffrin. who drove a_ blooper to

right field. Catcher Pete Martor-
elli tripled in Suffrin for the sec-
ond run. and that was all that
Siegle needed.

“Don pitched an excellent
game," said Lewis. Don still had
a control problem, walking eight
men, but we came up with the
double plays when we needed
them.”

The lone Buffalo State run came
on a series of infield outs. which
advanced a Buffalo Stater who
had walked and then advanced

' to second on a single.

The second game also had Pitt
scoring twice in the first inning.
Dennis Toboz opened the rally
with a walk, and Pete Martorelli
followed suit one out later. Sec-
ond baseman Rich Monroe sin-
gled in Toboz. and following a
walk to Suffrin. Harry Pardini
was walked with the bases load-
ed. sending Martorelli across with
the second run.

In the second inning, the Pan-
thers struck for three more runs.
Seneca walked, as did Toboz, and
Joe Groetsch doubled to score
Seneca. Martorelli followed with
a grounder to the second base-
man, which resulted in two runs,
as the keystoner threw wildly to
first base.

Martorelli scored in the fourth
inning when upon doubling. the
shortstop made a two-base error.

The Panthers exploded in the
sixth for nine runs. Pardini. Paul
Quarantillo, and Shamot all sing-
led. Two short flies to left had

. the Panthers apparently about to

end the inning, but Groetch
walked, then Martorelli singled in
two runs.

SCOTT SUFFERIN, Panther rightfielder, connecting for a base-hit. Suffrin,‘
started out red-hot at the plate, then cooled off when beset with a minor 3- 1
injury. He doubled in a key run Saturday, as Pitt swept a doubleheader: I

from Buffalo State. '

Monroe walked, Suffrin singled
in two more, Pardini singled in
one, Quarantillo one, and Shamot
two, before the inning finally
ended. Buffalo State wasn’t too
upset when rain washed out their
final at bat in the seventh inn-
mg.

Lewis will split Shamot and
Siegle in today‘s game. as he
doesn’t feel either one can go
nine strong innings after pitch-
ing seven Saturday.

Theporigin of basketball is rather interesting. At Springfield H

a problem. He couldn‘t get his students enthused about their in-

indoor football and soccer resulted only in bruised bodies and  ma“?

vented basketball.

I don't know about any broken windows. but the recent Unit-

The rule differences between collegiate and pro basketball
in the U.S. aren‘t really that significant. A 24—second shooting

therof the two and international rules are substantial.

One of the biggest differences is in the foul shooting. The

(How the international _rules ever developed is amazing. The
trend. in international sport favors less body contact. In hockey.

much more brutal play than the NBA.

most of whom had never played under the strange rules.

what their counterparts here. the NBA teams would do to them
The NBA. while not as muscular and bruising as international
