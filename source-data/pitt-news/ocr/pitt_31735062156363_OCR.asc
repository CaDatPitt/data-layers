 Available

To Admit

 Constitution; Votes

2 Schools

By -JOHN De NINNO

— - Student Congress met Monday to continue the job of

revising its constitution.

While at press time the exact results of this week’s re-

visions

were not known, the
v A

following changes were anti-

cipated.
' One important amendment, ac-
cording to Ross Reese, SC record-
ing secretary, is the admission to
Student Congress of representa-
-tives from the Engineering and

’ Mines Cabinet and the Pharma-

ceutical Council. Reese said ‘that
this is the ﬁrst time these two
organizations will have had rep-

’ , resentatives in Congress.

. _ Committees Abolished
,Another;change is the abolition

of the SC_ publicity committee and
the formation of a public rela-

tions committee. Membership in
the newly formed group will be
lirnited to 16 plus the chairman. A

‘faculty advisor to SC will work
.with this committee.

A clause ,'was_,_ expected to be

placed in the constitution giving

SC the authority to form special
committees whenever it feels nec-

essary.‘

As a result of a Pitt News edi-
torial, Reese stated, internal elec-
tions are expected to die in SC.
Vacancies will be ﬁlled by choos-
ing the persons who acquired the
next highest number of votes in
the spring general elections. Pre-
viously, vacancies were ﬁlled by
electing internally in SC.

Sophs Admitted

Last week, _Congress voted to
admit two sophomores to the or-
ganizatio, -and for the ﬁrst time
they wi avlhle voting power.

SC also chose to eliminate a
clause from the constitution __ call-
irig for the removal of members
for. “lack of interest.”

Jack Burwinkel, president of
Student Congress, said that the
revised constitution will be pre-
sented to. the student body for

‘approval, by vote, Wednesday,

'With Spring on its way, and summer to follow soon after, young
peoples’ thoughts should. turn to plans for “that summer abroad.”
For some extra credits and a vacation to remember, six weeks

‘ _The National Student Association:
‘offers a variety of tours to the

Art tours are conducted each

‘summer, enabling students to ob-

serve many of the priceless art
treasures of Europe. Internation-

[next ‘year. This week a team of SC observers is)co_nducting'
‘A ‘a‘ poll of student opinion to determine sentiment for and
_ gggainst the idea. Polling boxes have been placed at the
’ _-Student Desk, on the eighth and twelfth "ﬂoors, ' and_ in
Alumni Hall; and the pharmacy school. The ballot forms
are there ‘also. Ballots have been sent outto all important
campusorganizations to test group feeling on‘ the matter.
_' A free ﬁfth hour “is a good idea, and there is._an es-
tablished precedent. for it. Before the.war the freehour
was the rule every semester. Not until the war,-time in-
flux of servicement and the consequent decline of activi-
ties was. it abandoned. ‘In the post—w.ari‘years the campus
was jammed with extra thousands of returning veterans
. and class scheduling was such a difficult task that a free
 Thour during the day was impossible.

6’ "paying more attention ‘to out-of-class activities. A free

A ’ , There are many advantages to such a set-up. First, time
" is provided for general assembly periods for football game
, rallies during_ the season. Now it is standard practice to
.. limit the number of ralliesper season, and it is necessary
to schedule each one for an hour different than the last,
so that no one class on ‘a student’s schedule suffers an ex-
cessive cutting into its all'oted time over the semester. Thus,
-.-it is never possible to have more than four‘ or ﬁve day-
time, assemblies during the semester, and spontaneous cele-
. "brations always carry thefrisk of a class cut. With a free
" hour in the middle of the day there would_ be no limit to
the ‘number _of such assemblies possible. '

any, event- of\general student. interest, ‘such as the Pitt
Town meetings, the appearance of visting speakers, the an-
9 nual model U.N. session, debates of general interest, mixer
dances, blends, etc. It would provide time for meetings of
any campus organization,‘at a time when its members are
most liable to be in school. It would present a ﬁne oppor-
”tunity for student-faculty contacts. The last named 1S

Behind the pair, wno cracked

Panthers fell before a phenomenal

(1410) and Ohio University
(1385).

Firing for individual honors,
preceding the team matches,
Shepard and N oroski posted scores
of 285 and 283 respectively to
place second and third in the tour-

,ney. Last year at the same tour-

nament they tied for individual
honors.

The most amazing performance,
however, was ‘turned in by a
freshman, Bob Stanger, who re-
placed Joe Sankovic. Stanger ﬁred
a 100 possible from a kneeling po-
sition for the second varsity team.

other strong teams in the meet.

Stalin. ’ the ‘Hero 
Of the Obit Man

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
‘ Sports Editor

‘enough great ones dying to keep‘

 

 

~ When a great sports ﬁgure dies the obit man ‘assembles
his most handsome phrases and ﬁatters the deceased until
his burial day. The style of these articles is similar: “The

sports world saddened today by the passing of one of the

greatest, most vigorous, clean living, and democratic ath-
letes,” etc. ‘
Usually, though, ‘there aren’t

obituarians at work full-time. If
a solution isn’t reached soon, ;.the
art of great obituary writing will
die.~ So, we adopt a suggestion
from a dear friend and borrow
a few undesirables fromthe other
sciences. The great following ex-
periment iinvolves Joseplrstalin,
who will_ be classiﬁed hereafter as
a sports ﬁgure. .

It is hoped that by recalling his childhood a case will be
built to place Stalin’ among the lovers, of sport. He made too
many enemies in the world ‘to leave him in his new surround-
ings unprotected. Some group had to rally behind him. V

Actually, ‘the appearance of Stalin in sports" might well have

 

beenpa reality if not for ‘a few selﬁshambitions -the guy had.‘ From

the very‘ ﬁrst his mother," Catherine,‘ hoped" that the fourth child she
bore woud live’. If itwas a boy, she promised to name him for Saint
Joseph and dedicate him to thevservice of God.

A good start to be sure. Many ‘of the great American athletes
have‘ been dedicated to the/church. 'ITo‘"'mention only a few, there
are_Bob Richards and Gil.Dodds in track and'a‘ 1952 great,._Donn_
Moomow' in college football. . _

But Little Joey was to have it tough. Besides the miserable
surroundings of Gori, where he was born, healso had to put up
with a drunken father, Vissarion. Oh yes, Joey was born with
his left arm_ partially paralyzed and two toes grown together
unnaturally. - . ~ . ‘ ' . '

But this was to his advantage‘ since Weiwanted our sportsman
to win ‘the fancy of the fans. Recent cases of handicapped athletes
are numerous. Pete Gray,_a baseball player with the St. Louis Browns
for a short while, roamed the outﬁeld, with one arm. And Glenn
Cunningham overcame a serious foot injury to become a star.

But one affectionate gesture by Mother Catherine proved
a ‘major crisis in his life as a great athlete. His’ nickname was
Soso and Soso he was to remain to many acquaintances .as. he
grew older. How could a successful performer go through the

-motions‘ of attaining greatest with% name that denotes me-
diocrity? So died the her& of the obit man.

That’s right! In the U. S. Air, Force, it’s notthe

FIGHT IN THE MAN! And Aviation Cadets must have
‘plenty of.it. For Cadet training is rugged. If you’re
good enough .’  tough enough . . . smart enough . . .
if you can take it while you’re learning to dish it
‘out, you can have one of the most fascinating careers
in the world.=You’ll be equipped to ﬂylthe latest,

position as an executive, both in military and com-
mercial aviation as well as in industry. And while
you’rehelpingyourselfyou’llbehelpingyourcountry.

‘Hears WHAT to no:

‘WIN. YOUR WINGS! It takes little ‘over a
year to win your wings as a Pilot or Aircraft ,
Observer (Navigator,Bombardier, RadarOperator
or Aircraft Performance Engineer). But at the end
of your training you ‘graduate as a 2nd:Lieutenant
in the Air,Force, with pay of $5,300.00 a year.

ARE YOU ELIGIBLE? To qualify as an Aviation,
Cadet, you must have completed at least two years
of ‘ college. This is a,  §equirement—
it’s best if you ‘stay in school and graduate. In
addition, you must be between 19 and‘ 261/; years, .
unmarried, and in good physical condition.

_ New Aviation‘ Cadet Training Classes Begin Every Few ‘Weeks.’
