“Why‘__do you smoke today’s new Philip Morris Cigarettes,
hey?” a friend recently asked Beppo Schultz. _

“I smoke today’s new Philip Morris Cigarettes,” replred
Beppo, looking up from his 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive
double overhead camshaft British Sports Car. “heCa11..Se ‘they
are new.” . ‘

“New?” said the friend. “What do you mean—new?” _

“I mean modern—up-to—date——designed for today’s easier,
breezier living,” said Beppo. ‘

“Like this 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive double overhead
camshaft British sports car?” asked the friend.

“Exactly,” said Beppo. _ _

.j‘She’s a beauty,” said the friend, looking admiringly at the
car. “How long have you'had her?” -

 

“It’s a male,” said Beppo. .
“Sorry,” said the friend. “How long have you had him?
“About a year,” said Beppo. I 1

“Have you done a lot of work on him?” asked the friend.

“Oh, have I not!” cried Beppo. “I have replaced the pushrods
and rockers with a Rootes-type supercharger. I have replaced '
the torque with a synchromesh. I have replaced the tachometer
with a double side draft carburetor.” . -

“Gracious!” exclaimed the friend.  _

“I have replaced the hood with a bonnet,” saidrBeppo.

“Land 0’ Goshen !” exclaimed the friend.

“I have replaced the gasoline with petrol,” said Beppo.

“Cri_m-a-nentlies !” said the friend. ' s '

“And I have put gloves in the glove compartment,” said Beppo.

My, you have been the busy one!” said the friend. “You must
be exhausted.” , T ’ ‘
“Maybe a triﬂe,” said Beppo with a brave little srnile. ,
“Do you know what I do when I’m tired?” asked the friend. 1
“Light 3. Philip Morris?” Bepporventured.
“_0h, pshaw, you guessed!” said the friend, pouting. V. ' g -
“But it was easy!” cried Beppo, laughing silverly. “When
the eyelids droop and the musculature sags and the psyche is
‘depleted, what is more natural than to perk up with today’s
'_ Philip Morris in the red, white and gold package?” - '
“A bright new smoke in a bright new pack!” proclaimed the ‘
friend, his young eyes glistening with tears.
“Changed to keep pace with today’s changing -,world!” de- _
clared Beppo, whirling his arms in concentric circles. “A gentler,
~ more relaxing cigarette for a sunnier age, an age of greater .
leisure and broader vistas and more beckoning horizons!”

Now, tired but happy, Beppo and his friend lit Philip Morrises
and smoked for a time in deep, silent contentment. At length
the friend spoke. “Yes, sir,” he said, “he certainly is a beauty.”

“You mean my 2.9 litre L-head Hotchkiss drive double over-
head camshaft British sports car?” asked Beppo.

“Yes,” said the friend. ‘-‘How fast will he go?”

With defense funds geared primarily to air

graduate ofﬁcer material from a new academy in
Denver Colorado, and its graduates will come of

One of the most touchy dis-

years has been that concerning
a swimming pool for the Univer-

is a question no one has satis-
factorily answered. Certainly if
this school wants to rate itself
among the top, it should make
some’ allowance-for a pool. But
that allowance hasn’t been made,

mediate future plans.

Humor in Poor Taste

,By Jim Mqrino

When college students, who
should be at least approaching
some facsimile of maturity, sud-
denly begin acting like adoles-
cents it’s time
for serious
criticism. ,

During the
festivities of
Greek Week,
such’ an ex- A
hibition of
childishness
was, unfortu-
nately, not on-
ly handed to
the audience
as college hu-
mor, but accepted by some as
good entertainment. The program
of IF Sling was composed of

boring recitations of no comedy -

value at all, occasional hilarity,
and juvenile gigggling at the
mere mention of sex. , .
Sling ran the gamut from hon
est satire of the funniest variety
to out-and-out ﬁlth which show-
ed no originality and required
no thinking even by the dullest
member of ‘the ‘audience.

Judges at the Sling showed
their clear thinking in this mat-
ter by awarding trophies for the
mature presentation of humor
rather than the overwhelming
reaction of overgrown infants.

Sowell, Sm-i—th-Top Duo;

By DON KAISERIVIAN
Taking the lead from the starting gun, Arnie Sowell led
the pack all the way to the ﬁnish line as the Panther har-

riers crushed a highly—touted
Schenley Park last Saturday.
The Olsonmen copped the

Georgetown squad 15-46 at

the top eleven in their sixth win out of seven starts. A big
disappointment for the hardy few who braved -the cold

weather was the failure of the<>
Hoya’s two stars, Frank Pfalging

Sowell.

Get Together

It’s not too often that the oldest
record-holder in.a sport gets to-
gether with the ryoungest record
holder in that same sport but that
is exactly what you see in the
picture to the right.

This duoot‘ record holders are
none other than former Panther
All-American gridder and holder
of the discus record, Gilbert “Gib-
by” Welch, and half-mile cham-
pion Arnie Sowell.

The two titlists got together
Saturda-y morning at Schenley
Park right after Sowell had copped

I a five-mile cross country race by
-a good 40 to 50 yards.

Welch, who still holds the Pan-
ther discus record of 148- feet
which he set in 1926, came to
Pittsburgh from his Parlrersburg,
West Virginia, home to see Sowell
run Saturday morning. Sowe1l.set
his half-mile record of 1247.6 in
the National A.A.U. championships
at’Boulder, Colorado, last year.

Thus, Welch’s trip here to watch
internationally-famous Sowell run,
brought ‘together two of the out-
standing Pitt athletes of all time.
Welch has -made his marks in the
record books’ while Sowell is still

Students Wish to Eat and Lounge _

Poll Taken On Proposed Union

By NANCY C. JONES

(Editor’s Note: This is the first of/a series of articles on Pitt’s

planned Student Union.)

H

Students apparently think of lounging and ‘eating when
Pitt’s new student union isimentioned. Accordingto a poll
of 295 students taken by the Student Union committee May
31, the most essential things in their future Student Union
are a men’s and women’s lounge, a soda or snack bar, and

a. cafeteria.

A men’s loungelpolled the; highest number of votes on

vided in student’ unions,_ with a
“essential” ratings.
Comically, many men who thought
a men’s lounge was essential mark-.
ed a women’s lounge as unneces-
sary. However this did ‘not pre-
vent the women’s lourfge from
rating 204 essential votes. '
I The more savory thoughts of
students showed up when they
rated a soda or snack bar essen-
tial 206 times and a cafeteria 201
times. 4
Students feel the least necessary
facilities would be arts workshops,

photo studio and photo dark rooml
In the poll, which" proveddifﬁcult .

to interpret except in generalities,
the committee asked leaders on
campus and a few faculty mem-
bers to check on a list of 46 pos-
sible facilities which they regard-
ed essential, desirable, and unnec-
essary. Students were asked to
bear in mind that only about 75
per cent of the facilities could be
included in they Pitt Student Union.
Other Essentials

Other facilities which students
feel ‘are essential are game rooms,
Union. Board ofﬁce-, information

‘ bureau, checking service, lounge

terrace, dance halls, and study
rooms. Most students also strongly
want a table tennis room, a din-
ing room (coffee shop), student
government offices, a candy-cigar-
newscounter, and a-dining room
(c’ommuters’ .2, lunch) .

Considering both the essential
and the desirable ratings, the
‘following seem important to
most students: radio-television
rooms, music’ listening" room,
billiard or pool room, writing
room, shower and dressing
rooms for town studentsfmusic
room, conference rooms, lost and‘
found department, student or-
ganization offices, and rental
typewriters.

Bowling alleys were rated ‘desir-
able, as were .a banquet hall, stor-
age rooms, a vocal rehearsal room
(for Glee Club, Choral’, Choir, et.),
a small auditorium, instrumental
rehearsal room (for bands, or-
chestra, etc.). ' ._

Less desirable are a little thea-
ter, post office (student boxes),
trophy room-, luncheon meeting
rooms, publicity and poster room,
and, dining rooms (for private par-'
ties)_._ ‘ . '

Squeezing in as desirable but

_-with a ‘strong unnecessary vote

were a craft or hobby room, thea-
ter technical shop, art ' exhibit
room, and a dramatic rehearsal
room. L I ' U

tioned on the mimeographed poll,
however students often wrote it
in as a suggestion to be ‘consid-
ered. Dean Biddle and members
of the committee explained that

the reason they have not consid-

ered putting a swimming pool in
the Union is that a swimming pool
is the property of the athletic de-
partment and should be fostered
by them. ,_
They also felt that a swimming
pool would take up room and
money that could be used for
many other important facilities.

. The Student Union Committee,
which has been functioning

A

since April, 1955, has just re-
turned from a. visit to Pennsyl-
vania State University. The
committee inspected Penn State’s
new union and met with the
student union board.

According to Dean of Men T.
W. Biddle many students are not
aware that a Student Union Com-
mittee exists oncampus, but actu-
ally they met informally over the
summer and twice this fall.

Members of the committee are
Calliope Papandreas, president of
WSGA, Polly Markess and Bob
Timmons, representatives of Stu-
dent Congress, Emma Urbanek,
chief justice of-WSGA, Malcolm
Clemens, representative of Inter-
fraternity Council, Don Gartner,
representative of Men’_S. Council
and chairman of the SU commit-
tee, and Shirley Backstrom, pres-
ident of Panhellenic Council. Miss
Savina, Skewis, associate dean of
women, and Dean T. W. Biddle
accompanied the committee to
Penn State on Nov. 3.
