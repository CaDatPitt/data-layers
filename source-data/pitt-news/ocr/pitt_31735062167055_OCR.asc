  Pigeonholes?

 

Our guess: the press.

Because it was colorful and convenient.

But also because folks like it that way.

It's so much easier to choose up sides;

To dismiss everything a man says

(if he's on the other side)

Rather than go to all the trouble of weighing
The parts of his speech.

 
 
 
  
    

it's the way our politicians raised us, after all,
Or lowered us.

Partisan political palaver

Cries out for the easy label

And deserves it.

But the honest opinions of responsible men
Should stand or fall on their merit

Not their badge.

We hope you agree.

You are our life insurance.

Editorial: Tap Day Message

another instance of the lack of student leader interest for the causes
of the students.
Perhaps the most blatant case of this malady revolves around the
budget dilemma. The “student leaders” became bored with the financial
intricacies of state-relatedness. It is just amazing how many‘ leaders
of campus organizations sat back and let the tense situation of financial
urncertainty run its course. This is inexcusable. Here was a crisis that
involved the entire future of the University and many student leaders
passed it off as a passing fancy—a redundant theme.
The crux of the matter is that heretofore student leaders on cam-
- pus have failed to take distinct stands on issues of vital student con-
» cern. And this seriously affects the whole envi'ronment of student life.

By now the Tap Day ceremonies are over and we must wonder
what the realities of today’s proceedings mean in terms of student lead-

Throughout the years, the traditions of Tap Day have become a
I fixed entity in the student mind. This extreme emphasis on the awards
at Tap Day, has led to the weakening of student leadership on campus.
All too -often students run for offices simply because of the title
involved. We have seen many examples of student leaders who have not
provided the leadership that students here so vitally need. With all‘
their various titles, student leaders have done little to alter the climate
on campus. Even so, these same student 1
goal—recognition on Tap Day.

_ The Bookcenter issue is a case in point. This was one issue that
the students had a solid case. But there was no unified student support
for this issue. Were all the student leaders fighting for this cause? In
this case, only a handful of students were concerned enough to spare
. thetime needed for the careful resarch that insured our student posi-

Our concern with the lack of student leader support for the Book-
store is not an isolated example. When the Student Government passed
a resolution calling for a tuition reduction from $1400 to $1050 for out-
of‘-state students, there was no real unified student support. Here was

Of course, it may have been

We talked, bringing up all
those funny incidents we went
through together. And then he
told me the news I had expect-
ed to hear. «

It was the same news I had
heard from a couple other bud-
dies.

“I’LL BE going to Vietnam in
April,” he said. “I’m home on a
20 day leave. Then I head for
the West Coast. And sometime in
April, I’ll be overseas.” ,

Then he joked about the one
in a thousand Marines who “luck
out and get a Mediterranean
cruise. They’re usually some
governor’s son,” he quipped.

With his background in engi-
neering, Mike made the Artillery
Division; he’s a scout and he
plots graphs for his outfit. “The
Grunts,” as he calls them, are
infantrymen; “they"'.re the gung-
ho guys who’ll follow a sergeant
up the hill,” he blurted.

AND TOO, Mike has some more
funny stories to tell about boot
camp.

And in his own way, he jokes
about going overseas.

“When I get out in two . . . er

. if I get out in two years,
I’ll be okay. No one will miss me
much While I’m gone,” Mike
said, while pouring himself an.
other cup of coffee.

Later the same evening, when
we went out with a bunch of
other guys, someone who meant
no harm said, “I’ll see you when
you get back, if you don't get
killed.”

But Mike just stared  again

This unfortunately creates a poor state of affairs for the student.

We strongly urge the new student leaders to take a critical look
at the real issues confronting them. It is time to forget about titles—

Letters to the Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

It was with utter dismay that
we recently read a letter from
a Miss Marsha Kaplan, concern-
ing the Bradford campus. As
former students of that institu-
tion, we were both shocked and
distressed. From Miss Kaplan’s
letter, one would be ledto be-

lieve that the regional campus

at Bradford is in reality, an ex-
tension of President Johnson’s
Operation Head Start! We une-

quivocally and emphatically dis-

agree!

Certain points argued by Miss
Kaplan confuse us. Miss Kaplan
complains that, “they (regional
campuses) do not compare aca-
demically or socially . . . The
Bradford campus can ‘not even
pretend to offer a collegiate at-
mosphere.” Yet later, Miss Kap-
lan states that, “I have no com-
plaints about the 'courses that I
took.” This would lead one to be-
lieve that her complaints do not
center upon academics as much
as her concern for her social life.
For example, her grave declara-
tion that “. . .
curs,” and “People at Bradford
campus are trapped.”

nothing ever oc-

Logically her argument is both
invalid and unsound. Her major
premiss concerning the academic
standards at Bradford is based
entirely upon one course. Stu-
dents of Philosophy II (Logic)
will immediately recognize this
fallacy as a hasty generalization

. an attempt to categorize the
whole on the basis of a part.

Furthermore, we note that none

of us remember Miss Kaplan.
Considering the fact that some of
us attended the Bradford cam-
pus over the summer, we feel
that she must have been an enter-
ing freshman in September. This
means that she is basing her ar-
gument on observations gathered
in a single trimester . . . hardly
long enough to condemn an entire
campus.

We sincerely pity Miss Kaplan.
It is tragic when a young person
feels that the importance of a
full social life greatly outweighs
the benefits of an education.
Bradford is not a metropolis, yet
neither is it a barren wasteland.
Concerts do come to Bradford,
as do plays and the opera. Un-
fortunately, Miss Kaplan seems

A‘ to have overlooked this in her

haste to disparage the Bradford
campus. One wonders why she
transferred in the middle of her
freshman year. Yet this does not
. what does matter
to us is the reputation of the
Bradford campus of which we
were once a part.

Cubs Encounter Carnegie-Mellon IVs Tonight  
Caldwell Sees Improved Varsity Next Season

by JERRY GRUEBEL

If the freshman cagers want to be
added to the list of non-winners they
must beat the Carnegie—Mellon ]Vs ‘to-

night in the final game of the 1968 season.
Based on their first meeting, the Cubs are ex-
pected to win easily. ,

There are a number of reasons for the cubs
6-5 success. One overall reason is attitude,
something the varsity has been accused of
lacking. _

“Every guy on . the freshman basketball
team has good attitude," said guard Mike
Caldwell. “All of us played on winning basket-
ball teams in high school and we want to stay
winners.

But most freshman teams have had ood
attitudes in the past. The problem has een
maintaining the winning s irit. Losing is a bur-
den to this ‘problem, and osing consistently is

‘Next year we’ll have the four sophomores

tudes of the hoopsters of these past two years.
Attitude means a whole lot,” said Cald-
well. If you go out on the court expecting to
win chances are you re going to win. ” I
-But attitude isn t everything; talent is ne-
cessary also. Caldwell represents one of a new
breed of talented freshmen athletes who know
what it means to win.

Caldwell was recruited from Lebanon High
School in _,Indiana, anhigh school which has al-
ready produced Jeff Pribbett of LSU and
sophomore sensation Rick Mount of Purdue.

He started the season off slowly, but by the
third game, Caldwell was scorin at a healthy
pace. At Morgantown against 5Vest Virginia,
Caldwell poured in 21 points to lead the Cubs

to victory. He was also a key man in the other

five Cub wins.

t CMU Tonight  

Mike Patcher Finishes
Disappointing First Year

by_MIKE BROURMAN, Assistant Sports Editor
“A season that began with so much promise for
sophomore forward Mike Patcher will end tonight
with little of either hope being fulfilled.

The cagers visit Carnegie-Mellon at 8:15 pm.‘ and they
need a win to bring thdir record up to an unimposing 7-15. And
Patcher, who sparked the team in many of the early ball games
will spend much of his time on the bench.

first signs of any trouble.

Mike Patcher was merely
one _of the cogs in the wheel
which broke down, but his
story‘ is typical of all of then.
“I started out fairly well, but
his storv‘is typical of all of
them. “I started out fairly
well, but then I went into a
slump.” Change the name,
and this statement could be
attributed to almost any of
the cagers.

What caused the slump?
“I don’t know,” Mike admits.
“I’ve been thinking about it.
Maybe it’s_a lack of confi-
dence. After a _while you start
to lose our confidence and
are afraid to shoot. I have-
n’t been shootin half as much
lately as Idid ear ier.”

Some people have suggest-
ed another reason. They point
out that Patcher spent the first
part of the season playing cen-
ter, and that is when he was
scoring. After he was moved.
toforward, his point produc--
tion fell off. 1

Patcher admits a preference-
for working around the key,
and he admits some problems
developed from being cons-
tantly moved around. “When
Fm hitting I’d rather play
around the key, and drive cut-
ting off the key either way,”
he said.

‘-‘When you're being moved
from the pivot to the corner,
all the time, you. start to lose
your effectiveness,” Mike con-
tinued. “You go into ,a game
feeling uneasy about it.

But, Patcher refuses to blame
his slump completely on this.
“I was at a disadvantage, play-
ing the ivot because Im so
small. Ater a while muscle
tells, and those bi guys wore
me down.” Still ﬁie Panthers
met taller teams early in the
season than they have been
playing lately. And Patcher,
utilizing his quickness to off
set his height disadvantage
was scoring well then.

Mike is already
about next year, and he see_s
an improved team. “I know
that’s what eople have been‘
saying for t e ast two years
and it hasn‘t appened, but
you have to keep pride

For Bob Timmons, the book
closes tonight. But Mike Patch-
er still has two more chapters
to write, and his story may yet
have a happy ending.

that the whole is equal to
the sum of its parts. A relay
team, however, is not ‘equal
to the performance of four in-

from the total team effort.

ed time of 7:-10.9.

lay team are the quarter mil-

Brown were the top 4-10 run-

Hufnagl, too. had to face

less than nine runners com-
peted for the half—mile s ot.
The four runners know tey
are the best in their distance.
They also know they are a

For example, the lead Brown
had when he received the ba-
ton Saturday didn’t please
him. “I’d rather chase.some-
one than be chased.”

Coach Jim Banner did any-
thing but let the victors wal-
low in their spoils this week
in practice. The real test for
the medley relay team is the
IC-1As competition in March,
and the spirit must continue
at maximum output for the
whole team to be at its best.

of working for some huge company where I'd
be just another number," says IBM’s Jim Hamil-
ton. (Jim, who has a B.S. in Electrical Engineering,
is a Systems Engineering Manager in Marketing.)

“At the same time, I knew there were deﬁnite ad-
vantages in working for a large ﬁrm. So as I interviewed
each company, I checked into the degree of individuality
I could expect there. '

“One of the main reasons I picked IBM was their decentral-
ization. They’ve got over 300 locations throughout the country.
Which to me means a big company with a small-company
atmosphere."

IBM's small team concept V
“Actually, there's plenty of decentralization even within each
location. Forinstance, in science and engineering, they use a
small team concept. It means, no matter how large the project,
you work individually or as part of a small team-—about four
for ﬁve people.

“In marketing, I was pretty much my own boss even
before I became a manager. As a systems engineer, it’s
up to you to ﬁnd the solution to a customer’s problem,
and then see it's carried out in the optimum way. You
work with the customer every step of the way."

mentioned. For more information, visit your campus
