The Chancellor_v of Student Af-
fairs may be sporting a new look
soon.

The overhall. proposed and
planned by- Bernard Kobosky. the
Vice—Chancellor of Student Af-
fairs. is one that will alter the tra-
ditional concepts of the office and
tighten up the operation.

In an effort to eliminate the
aura of “paternalism" that has
marked student affairs in the past.
Kobosky is stressing a reorgan-
ization that will provide student
services in a broad framework.

The former Director of Admis-
sions emphasized in an interview
that the move to revamp is based.
initially, on a philosophical pre-

'$,mise. “The concept is one that is

flexible and progressive," he felt.

Kobosky expects the change-
over to result in “increased com-
munication and coordination
among the staff members, better
definition of our role within the
University and, above all, better
services for students.”

Structurally, the change in-
volves centralization of student
activities as opposed to the patch-
work that has characterized the
University up until the present.

Academic Deans and other per-
sonnel who deal specifically with
student concerns.

Parallel but related. the areas
of admissions and student aid will
be coalesced under the control of
a newly assigned Dean of Admis-
sions and Student Aid. Kobosky's.
belief is that the Dean will coordi-_
nate the efforts of the two depart-
ments and direct all activities in
the area of student recruitment.

Special emphasis will be given
to special admissions and student
aid programs. Reporting to the
Dean of Admissions and Student
Aid will be one director in each
area.

The Assistant Chancellor is con-
cerned with the expedition of stu-
dent needs. He is convinced that
the stabilized infrastructure will
take student affairs in this direc-

.ti.on. -.

According to Kobosky. the Dean
of Student Development will be li-
able for the functioning of seven
subordinate departments in the
area of student affairs. r

While accenting the possibility
that the details may be'changed.
Kobosky revealed that newly cre-
ated positions will include:
—Director of Student Activities;

responsibility i.n.Y.0_lYes the. man-

agement and program activities

—-Director of Research and Infor-
mation; broadly responsible for
conducting projects and studies
dealing with the facets and ac-
tivities of student life.

Also reporting to the Dean are
areas which previously functioned
outside the Student Affairs Office.
but which will be integrated under
the altered structure.

These directorships will include:

—Director of Student Housing;

control of the operation and
maintenance of the residence
halls and the functioning of the
food programs, in the broad def-
inition.
—Director of Placement Services.
—Director of Counselling Services.

—Directors of Student Health

Services; previously under the
joint control of the Medical
School and Student Affairs, will
operate as in the past. '

The innovations will necessitate
in some cases the reassignment of
University personnel and in
others. the placement of newly-
hired administrators. However.
Kobosky expects that contempor-
ary personnel will be integrated
fully into the newly proposed
structure.

Kobosky fully anticipates that
the specifics of his proposal may
be changed at the appointment of
the Dean of Student Affairs. which
will be finalized by July 1. But he
hopes that the general guidelines
and principles underlying the
move will be retained.

Revamping Slated In Student Affairs ,

In the preview he released to
The Pitt News, Kobosky believed
that “a redefinition of Student Af-
fairs is long overdue in light of the ,

many changes in the role of the L ' 

student on campus.

What he felt was a “lack of com-
munication with the staff“ was a
partial rationale for the‘reorgan-
ization.

In an essentially positive ap-” 
proach to the restructuring of’ 
Student Affairs, the Assistant ‘

Chancellor foresees an elimina-

tion of overlap in functions and‘ 
the lack of cohesion among the’  

administrative personnel. But ad-
mittedly. his primary concern is
the welfare of the students.

Though the rush for choice Oak-
land parking spaces is not severe
in’ the summer. students may still
take advantage of low-cost spaces
in parking lots rented» by the Uni-
versity. ’

Arrangements were completed
last summer between the Univer-
sity and Carnegie Museum and
John Katsur. whereby the Muse-
um and Katsur agreed to rent
parking spaces in their lots to stu-
dents at reduced rates. Though
jammed in the fall andwinter. the

and societal issues.” _ '

Although all are what the "over
30" generation would call hippies.
the Streetpeople have no group po-
litical leaning. Lou: one of the
more outspoken members. claims
that "some are militant and some
are into the peace thing. Lou. a
virile 21-year-old with long.

dark hairrand a medium-sized
goatee. considers himself a mili-
tant. having been "pushed against
the wall."-

like that cat.’-' ‘

Then there‘s Rich Kid. who ac-
quired his nickname because he
once attended a private school.
He's boyishly good—l‘ooking with
sandy-blond hair and a tan. Rich
Kid is friendly in a quiet sort of
way. and when he smiles. it‘s
enough for two people. He enjoys
the role of a tease. and during a
recent trip to Ohio Pyle (a park on
the Youghogheny River) he did
everything from an imitation of
an ape carousing on the rocks to,
pushing his nose against our car
window.

The link between the “Y” and
people like Lou and Rich Kid is

. Mrs. Sue B. VanDoren, one of the

directors at the “-Y” and the spon-

sor of the Group. As the Street- .

people are a “non-organization,”
Sue is their “non-director.” She is
the sources of the Streetpeople’s
success as a cohesive group.

As Lous asserts. “Sue lets us
on our own. She doesn‘t force us
to do things. She asks us what
we'd like to do." Several of the
group feel that their organization.
could not continue without the
type of backing that Sue gives to

while rock music plays fromgalm;

portable stereo.

When the meeting begins, 7the ‘g 
group may discuss its last pro-«‘-., _

ject or future projects. If a mem-‘
ber is in trouble, or facing a per-
sonal crisis, Streetpeople will dis-
cuss ways to help him. At these

times, the feeling they have for.‘ 

one another becomes clear. One

young woman refers to Street--

people as "a “family.” If oneof
their family is in need, they re-
spond quickly and often with what

they know will help-—a true dis-
play of love, friendship and sup- ' 

port.
At happier times, they will in-

vite guest speakers. Policemenl, 

and a Hari Krisna religious group

have already participated in their; C  

meetings. Members may bring. in A
samples of art work or poetry;

they hold their own drama‘ and art ‘ f

classes, and play music for each

other. Recently they’ve planned

to make their own movie.

The meeting usually breaks up
for smaller sensitivity sessions,
with at least one counselor in each‘,

group. “These groups," writes S,‘

Denise. a. graduating highfschool
senior. “help make a person think

A VAST WASTELAND is what it seems to be, though it really is a parking
lot. Though available for student usage, the parking area at 3820 Bates

 

University. related that the mod-
est success of, the plan puzzles
him and others in the administra-
tion. "I don’t understand." ‘won-
dered the treasurer. “why more
students haven‘t been using these
lots. We've had them for about a
year now. and lately. they never
seem to be filled."

Katsur, who operates six lots

in the Oakland area, might consi-
der that an understatement.
Terming his business “really
dead,” Katsur backed his report
with rather. amazing figures. “I

St. suffers from a hard case of summertime blues.

Katsur offers parking to stu-
dents at the rate of $12 for a two
month period. His lot at 3820
Bates St. is his closest to the Uni-
versity. and Katsur believes that
the five-block walk from that
parking area to the Cathedral
might cause students, to search for
more convenient spaces.

"I imagine." speculated Kat-
sur. "that business will pick up
again in the fall. Once registration
is back to normal. students will be
looking for parking again." _ ‘

ploiting the 50 cents per day price
and the single block between the
lot and the Cathedral, 60 to 80 stu-
dents have been using the lot daily.

.. Only slightly more than one-
third of the lot is available to stu-
dents. since 100 to 160 spaces
are reserved for University facu-
ty and staff. To accommodate the
expected push in the fall. the Uni-
versity has undertaken to enlarge

more as a moderator than a tradi-

ideas and waits for theapproval
of the group. She believes strongly
that there should be little distinc-

group counselors, and herself.

Mound- For Star Win

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Pitts Bob Solonickne. who has ,

played a lot of football. must have

been wondering where the goal,

line was Sunday at Forbes Field
when he'was placed in the Tri-
State College Baseball Coaches
All-Star game in the eighth inning
—-five innings after he was remov-
ed from the line-up. V

Anyway. after disaster appear-
ed near for the North squad. the
baseball version of the grid irons

free substitution worked. Solo-I

nickne. who started the game in
rightfield and went 0-for-2 swing-
ing the bat. survived an eighth inn-
ing threat from the pitchers
mound and helped the North in the

‘ ninth with a single as.the North

defeated the South. 6-2.

The Northhas now won the first
two. games in‘ the annual All-Star
affair. . /

Usually a baseball player isn’t
permitted to enter 5 game once he

has been removed, but Pitt coach

Bobby Lewis,'wh'o was in charge
of the North’sbuIlpen Sunday ex-

plained. why the South squad did- ‘

n’t complain when Solonickne re-
placed Tony ‘Morris, who injured

his shoulder after allowing two .

singles inthe eighth inning, while‘
the North led, 2-0. »

"We're allowed to do it in this
game.",Lewis said. "We. agreed
that if someone were injured we

[could put someone else backin."

Ordinarily. the North wouldn‘t

Student Insurance
lBenefﬁs:hnproVed

(Editor's Note: The following information concerning the new Univer-
sity insurance plan was released from the office of Dr. Joseph Hinchcliffe,
director of the Student Health Center.)

HEALTH INSURANCE FOR STUDENTS

Beginning in September. 1970. a new health insurance policy-

will be available to students. The old policy. which had not been up-
dated for four years. was $26 per year: the new policy will cost $39.

Inflation alone increased the cost of the old policy to $34: expand-
ed benefits account for the remainder of the increase.

In early August, insurance applications and brochures _will _be
mailed to all students—undergrads, grads and professional-—tak1ng six

The Office of the Registrar has
made a few adjustments for fall
registration due to the initiation
of the credit-no entry system.
Registration processes will be ac-
celerated with the key punching
of schedules from the course se-
lections. Assistant Registrar Fred
Sehring stated that a problem may
arise with the key punching pro-

‘ cedure. Illegibility may give the

key punchers some difficulty, and,
as a result, about five per cent of

the students may be incorrectly -

scheduled.

Beginning this fall, students
who cancel their invoices will re-
lease their class cards to other
students, immediately upon can-

cellation, through the registrars.
