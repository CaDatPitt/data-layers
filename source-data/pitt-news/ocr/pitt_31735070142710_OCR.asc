Police Review Board hears G—2O arrest concerns

john Manganaro
For The Pitt News

Pittstudents and community members
gathered last night in Lawrenceville to
‘speak out against police behavior dur-

ing last month’s G—2O Summit.
At the gathering, organized by the

Citizen Police Review Board, residents
from around the Pittsburgh area took
turns sharing experiences and com-
plaints related to G—2O police activity.

Speakers were given three minutes
eachto describe whatthey experienced
in various neighborhoods during the
nights of Sept. 24 and 25.

Some complaints tookto the micro-

phone timidly, relatingtheir stories with
downturned eyes. Others, like Point
Breeze resident Mel Packer, expressed
their feelings with outrage.

“Our pedestrian-friendly city was
turned intoamilitarybase,” Packer said.
“This was not the city I love.”

As Packer spoke, others attending
the meeting loudly. grumbled “hear-

or two expressed positive sentiments
about the behavior ‘of tlie police.

“The comerwhere I livewas gassed,
and the [Long Range Acoustic Device]
happened right outside my window,”
said Carleton Gholz, a graduate student
studyingcommunications at Pitt. ‘That
night and the next night, I received
reports of my own students being ar-

Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh loses funding,

Kyle Kramer
Staff Writer

The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
asked its Oakland patrons why they
love their library.

People wrote their answers
on a once-blank white board:
“Libraries=Freedom,” “Because you
can geta$100,000 educationforﬁee”
and “Libraries areahallmark of every
great civilization.”

One person even wrote, “It saves
me a lot of money on textbooks.”

The poster, put on the secondﬂoor
of the library’s main location, is part
of the “Protect your Library” media
campaign, which library spokeswom-
an Suzanne Thinnes said is aimed to
raiseawareness and rallysupportfrom
Pittsburgh communities in spite of
cuts in government ﬁinding.

As Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh
administrators cut jobs and close
branches, the library in Oakland
should remain relatively intact. The
library’s board of trustees armounced

it will reduce services and cut open-
ing hours, along with other cutbacla,
beginningjan. 2.

The Oakland branch will not face
any radical changes, Thinnes said. Pa-
trons of the main library can expect
fewer hours of operation, services
and, possibly, a loss of some familiar
staff faces. But four of the 19 branches
— Beechview, Lawrenceville, West
End and Hazelwood—willbe closed,

based on how easily communities can 5
access otherbranches through major ‘

bus routes.

The Carnegie Library administra-
tors are still consideringthe new hours
of operations. They will determine
which hours will be cut by looking
at the times of highest traffic in each
branch. '

Some branches might close on
Mondays to preserve Saturday hours,
Thinnes said. But for now, evening

hours are primarily being considered ‘

for cuts. The main location’s hoursare
10 am. to 8 p.m. Monday through
Thursday, 10 am to 5:30 p.m. Friday
and Saturday and 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Sunday.

Jake Pawlak, a senior political sci-
ence and economics major at Pitt, said
he does think cut backs in hours and
services will affect him signiﬁcantly.

“I study there in between classes
sometimes, or sitinthe periodical sec-

night—time adult programs are likely
to be cutﬁrst. These programs mainly
include cultural and musical events

hosted by the Carnegie Library.

The Carnegie Library is expecting
a$6 million deﬁcitby2014; at current
levels of funding. The goal ofthe board
hopes to cut expenses by $3 million
andincrease revenue by $3 million
by that time to counteract the deﬁcit,

administrators handled that predica-
ment ina similar way —— by cutting
hours and staff, Thinnes said. "
Before 2002, the Carnegie Library
had no problem keeping its main
branch open 65 hours per week to

meetstate public library requirements, A

said Thinnes. Since the cuts, however,
the hours at the Oakland branch have
hovered around 63. As a result, the
board oftrustees continuallypetitions
the state to retain Carnegie Library’s
state ﬁinding.

“The state gives us mandates, and
then they don’t give us the ﬁinding we
need to meet the mandates,” Thinnes
said. “And we’re not alone. Many other

‘libraries across the commonwealth

must petition.”

The current trouble stems from
shortcomings in two of the library’s
main sources offunding, accordingto
Thinnes. Carnegie Library competes
for the majority of its funding with

eight other organizations that are A
considered public assets by Allegh-

eny County’s Regional Asset District.
They include Phipps Conservatory, the
Carnegie museums and the Pittsburgh
Zoo. The county’s 1—percent sales tax

budget, Thinnes said.

Student Government Board to host mayor candidate face—off at Pitt

Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

The three mayoral candidates will
face off at a public meeting hosted
by Student Government Board’s
governmental relations committee
this weekend.

The committee chair, Nick Train-
er, announced at the board meeting
yesterday that Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl agreed to join independent
candidates Franco Dok Harris and
Kevin Acklin at the event scheduled
for Sunday, Oct. 25, at7 p.m. in David
Lawrence Hall rooms 120 and 121.

Trainer said that the candidates
will each have 20 to 30 minutes to
use as they please. They may deliver
speeches or ask questions.

Board member Lance Bonner
introduced a resolution to change
the SGB elections code. The Board
tabled the resolution for one Week,
the normal procedure.

SGB president Kevin Morrison
said the Board votes on the election
code every year toamake the sure
people running for Board positions
understand the rules.

Morrison said the proposed elec-
tions code allows businesses to put
up SGB campaign advertisements

as long as the business ﬁlls out an
endorsement form. - '

“We shouldn’t have to regulate
that,” Morrison said.

The proposed code also deﬁnes
when candidates may start posting
ﬂiers. The election will be held from
8_a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 19.
Paper campaigning begins Wednes-
day Nov. 18.

Board member Max Greenwald
said posting ﬂiers doesn’t really help
candidates get elected.

A “The only reason they do it is be-
cause they see everyone else doing
it,” he said.

The Board reminded students to

wear blue at the game versus Univer-
sity of South Florida on Saturday as
part of the Turn it Blue initiative.
Greenwald said Pitt Athletics and
other organizations have been work-

ing together to decorate the campus 1

for Homecoming.

Morrison commented that he
liked the blue-painted trees.

“I don’t know if it’s going to, like,
kill them, or if they’re going to live
through that, but either way it’s deﬁ-
nitely worth it,” hejoked, referring
to the trees. ‘

SGB Notes:
—The Board approved the allo-

cations comn1ittee’s recommenda-
tion of $1,740.98 out of the $1,773
Hillel JUC requested to bring in-a
speaker. ,

-The Board granted Free The
Planet $261.06 of the requested
$782.12 to send students to the
Power Shift Conference. .

. -The—American Society of Civil
Engineers received its requested
amount of $1,360.22 for ﬁve of its
members to attend a conference. .

Although Regional Asset District funding
declined for Carnegie Library over the last sev-
eral years, the library recently secured avictory
with the release of the Regional Asset District’s
preliminary budget for the next year. The Re-
gional Asset District’s board of directors decided
that, because the services of the library are ﬁ'ee
—unlike the Carnegie museums or Phipps — it

would not change the library’s funding levels. ’

This came after some negotiaﬁon between the
library’s board of trustees and the Regional Asset
District’s board of directors, Thinnes said.

State subsidies, which provide 20 percent of
Carnegie Library’s ﬁinding, have fallen drasti-
cally, Thinnes said.

The city of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, provides
$40,000 of funding to the Carnegie Library,
Thinnes said. This was the amount of city-con-
tributed ﬁmds agreed upon between Andrew
Carnegie and the city ofPittsburgh at thetnmof
the 19th century. It stands today and comprises

No library staff safe

less than 1 percent of library’s budget.

~ Although unpopular and unwelcome,
Thinnes said that some closures could actually
beneﬁt the library system. The board of trustees
had been discussing the possibility of closures
for several years before the current crisis was
evident, she said; ‘

“It’s hard if you’re living in a community
with a closing branch,” Thinnes said. “But may
be good for the long term health of the library
system.” .

She cited the population decreases within
Pittsburgh over the last 50 years. Proportional
to the current population, Pittsburgh does not
need 19 branches, Thinnes said.

Concerning the proposed job cuts, Thinnes
said there are virtually no‘ safe pbsitions at any
branch inthe library system. She expressed con—i
cem for her own job.

“I’m always worried,” Thinnes said. “It’s a
very stressful time.”

UPMC seeks smokers ages 18-65 who.are
planning to quit smoking soon.

UPMC seeks smokers for research on the short-
term effects of an FDA-approved oral medication,
Chantix (varenicline), on smoking behavior,
craving, and mood. This is not a treatment study.

You will first have a brief physical exam. The study
has two phases, each 8 weeks long. You will be
asked to try to quit smoking for five days during
each phase. You will visit the lab 35 days

each week. Each visit will last 10-15 minutes.

 

THINKING OF QUITTING SMOKING?

Visits will be scheduled between the hours
of 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. ‘

You will be asked to take study medication that
may or may not contain the active medication.
Participants who complete the entire study will
receive $595. 4

All participants will be given free written materials
on quitting smoking at the end of the last session.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s proposal

- cost students hundreds of dollars.

The proposed tax has escalated in
recentweeks fromaﬂat $100-per—year
feeto alpercenttaxon tuition, and the
mayor said hewill not releaseaspeciﬁc
proposal until November9 — six days
after the mayoral election.

“\

Ravenstahl’s vulgar out-
burst was more than just a
cheap joke 

The mayor’s reﬁisal to propose
speciﬁc new taxes before the election
demonstrates the political opportunism
thatyoifdexpectﬁomamanrunningas
bothaDemocratandaRepublican, and
it’sthiscrass opportunismthat deﬁnes
Ravenstahl’s relationship with young
people in the city.

The problem is that the mayor
knowswe don’tvotewith any regularity

' thewayunions do andwealso don’tgive

thousands of dollars to his campaign
the way that prominent development

companiesliketheForzaGroupandthe -

Rubinoffco. do.

Coincidentally, we are much more
likely as a group to be gassed and shot
with rubber bullets than members of
unions or corporate executives.

Ravenstahl mocked the post-G-
20 Summit grievances of students at
“Off the Record IX,” the Post—Gazette’s
annual variety show, on Oct. 1. The
Pittsburgh City Paper reported that
Ravenstahl appeared on stage in riot
gear and said, “I heard we’re going to
face a free—speech lawsuit Well, I have
somefreespeech foryou: F*ckyou, Vic
Walczak.”

Ravenstahl’s tirade against Wale-
zak, the legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania,
was not just childish and crude but de-
monstrative ofthe contemptthe mayor
has for civil liberties and the men who
defend them. '

One of the few voices publicly
condemning the mayor’s behavior, in-
dependent mayoral candidate Kevin
Acldin, said Ravenstahl’s appearance
was “offensive and inappropriate.” I
contacted the mayor’s office to get his
side ofthestorybut my requestf0rcom-
ment was declined.

Acklin said that it sent a message
to students and others affected by the
G—20 Summit that Ravenstahl isn’t
waitingfor atrial and that“he’s already
made up his mind that it’s okay for the
mayor’s office to  Oaldand,
to abuse students’ rights and then to
use those offenses as a punch line for
a cheap laugh.”

But Ravenstahl’s vulgar outburst

wasmore than justacheap joke, itwasa
jab madebyamanwhothinkshe exists
above civilized discourseinacitywhere
very few institutions or individuals have
the power to stand up to him.

Indeed, Ravenstahl seems to be
right, as it took two weeks for the sto-
ry of his conductto even appearinthe
press. The Post—Gazette, atwhose event
he made suchcrass remarks, endorsed
him on Sunday as the only candidate
who “can handle the job” of mayor.

Clearly, tliemainstieaminstzitutions
ofthis city have failed to hold the mayor
accountable and would rather remain
on his good side than demand that he
shape up and articulate a viable ﬁxture
for the city. This is the crux of the mat-
ten the Ravenstahl Administrationhas
never articulated a vision of the city’s
future, but has instead devoted its en-
ergies to getting even with the mayor’s
enemies and enriching the mayor’s
campaign contributors.

Remember, this is the mayor that
tried to cut City Council’s staff over a
budget disagreement and an Admin-
istration that has overseen the award-
ing of lucrative contracts to campaign '
donors evenwhenthey aren’tthe lowest
bidders.

Editorial

Some spare change
we can believe in

he stimulus funds that the
, government awarded to
the states several months

ago had two primary functions:
get the stagnant economy churn-

ing and help create thousands of '

jobs. Pennsylvania has received
a sizeable stock of funds so far
— $39,190,000 — and 495jobs
have been created as a result, ac-
cording to www.recovery.gov.
But Pennsylvania is using the
money in a variety of ways, one
of which is for human services
projects. The state was awarded
$2,035,150,0o0 total in stimulus
funds — an amount second only
to Washington state’s $2.2 bil-
lion. Yesterday, spokesmen for
Allegheny County and the city
of Pittsburgh announced the for-

mation of a program intended‘

to offer ﬁnancial "assistance and
services to homeless individu-
als and families. The program
aims to help the economically
destitute more than to serve as
a direct economic stimulator.

There’s a plethora of outlets for
stimulus money, but given Penn-
sylvania’s decent batch of funds,
such programs aren’t necessarily
shirking money from more ap-
propriate uses. Everyone wants
to see the economy recover, but
there are clearly more people in
need than there are unemployed
middle-class Americans.

The new program is known
as the Homeless Prevention 8:
Rapid Re-Housing Program. Al-
legheny County received more
than $14 million for human ser-
vices programs from the Ameri-
can Recovery and Reinvestment
Act, according to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. The program in-
tends to grant quick-ﬁx aid with
rent and utility payments, as well
as access to counseling and relo-
cation services.

To meet the criteria for as-
sistance, participants must be
homeless or on the verge of
homelessness. They also must not

' have means of ﬁnancial support

to obtain housing or any available
housing options. Applicants must
be below 50 percent of the area
median income to apply — for
a family of four that measuresin
at $31,250.

Potential qualifiers might
be caught up in economic cri-
sis but could potentially make a
turnaround under the program’s
policies. Some homeless suffer
from mental handicaps and other
hindrances that prevent them
from carrying out a traditional,
independent lifestyle. Yet, for the
individual or family who’s down
on their luck, such a measure
should, at the very least, help
in starting over. Keeping this in

‘ mind, the program doesn’t pro-

vide a clear immediate economic
boost. _

The program could provide
that much-needed check for next
month’s rent and, if carried out
correctly, a second chance that
seems too hardto come by in an
unforgiving economy.

Watch out vampires — the ‘Werewolf’ is here

Full moon or not, Gene the Werewolf plans to bring the party to Diesel. Howling is deﬁnitely encouraged.

Sarah Simkin
staff Writer

Doors: 6:30 p.m. Show 7 p.rn.

Ridiculous and awesome.

Spectacular adjectives, but the best
words to describe aband?

Ifthat band is Gene the Werewolf,
lead singer and guitaristjon Belan will
settle for nothing less.

“We wanted somethingthatwould
build an impression on somebody.
When you tell someone to check some-
thing out, [awesome and ridiculous] are

.prettyst1'ongwords.”Belansaid.“Ifyou

see us for the ﬁrst time, you’re goingto
think, ‘This really is ridiculous, what
are those guys up to?’”

What they are up to is having en-
tirely too much fun. '

Belan showed up for his interview
with The Pitt News as himself, Izzie
soda in hand, ratherthan his alter ego
—- the jack Danie1s—swilling werewolf
Gene.

“When I’rn just dressed in normal
clothes, it’s hard to portray the image
of Gene. It’s very in your face — it has
that edginess that everyone wants to
have sometimes,” he said.

It was a friend that gave the then-
long-haired—and—bearded Belan the
Gene the Werewolf nickname. The
idea ofbeingawerewolfsymbolized the
transfomiation ﬁom mild-mannered
musician to the outrageous stage per-
sona that the band was going for, and
was thus the perfect band name.

“Gene only knows 110 percent. Ifit
can’tbeoverthe top, Gene the Werewolf
wants nothing to do with it,” he said.

Guitarist and vocalist Drew Done-
gan described Gene the Werewolf’s
sound as “classic rock with a modern

‘ vibe,” similar to what bands like Kiss,

Def Leppard and Motley Criie would
sound like if they released their music
today  a far cry from the pop-punk
bands the band members had been in
previously.

' “We also like the term diamond-
core, because diamond is the hardest
rockknownto man” Donegan said.

“it’s deﬁnitely the most different
band we’ve ever been in,” Belan said.

Band members have previously
been part of Pittsburgh—based bands
Ptmchline, Clearview Kills and The
Berlin Project.

Donegan said that although the
band members have “all had ourshare
ofbeing in band that we thought were
good and peoplewere like, ‘Eh,’ people
genuinely like the ban ”

“We’ve gottenalot of compliments
behindthe sceneswhenwe leave inter-
views and things like that, and we’ve
seen un-genuine.” ‘

Plenty of bands aren’t shy about
ﬂaunting cocky bios and making no
secret of their self-perceived talent,
butfewtake itasfaras Gene the Were-
wolf.

“We used to say we were the best
rock band, but by now I’d say we’re just
the best band ever,” Donegan said.

Belan said that the fan reaction to .

the bandhasbeen“amazinglyunbeliev-
able. Ourﬁrstshow sold outin2o min-
utes. Forsoo or 600 peopleto cometo
seeabandthathasn’tbeenaroundvery
long is ridiculous.”

Donegan said that Gene the Were-
wo1f’sfanbaseisa“strange crossover”
ofpeoplethatlikedthe members’ previ-
ous bands — primarily fans ranging
from 15 to 20 years old —- and older
listeners.

“Olderfansthatgrewupwhen Guns

A N’ Roses was on the radio tend to get it

easier,” Donegan said.

“I guarantee if you give this CD to
your parents, you won't get it back,”
Belan added.

Belan said of the differences in au-
diences’ reactions based on age, “At a
younger show the crowd moves around
a lot and you get mosh pits. Older fans
will juststand there and watch, and
were like, ‘Do they like us or do they
hate us?”

Donegan’s favorite concertmemory
shows how much he wants people to
rock out to the music.

“I’ll never forget it: Therewas a19-
year—old college student up in front
dancingwith these, like, 40-something
women.This kid was just gettingdown,
and that is exactly what this should be.
We want people to come to shows and
have a good time. [If they don’t], it’s
like goingto aparty and not partying,”
Donegan said.

The band ﬁnished recording its six-
trackEP debut album lag/2tMe Up more
than a year ago.

Stahl: Calling all hipsters! Date needed

Stahl places a call to the Pitt hipster population, offers some advice

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

Open casting call to all hipsters: I’m
looking for a date.

I’ve been in this peskily nostalgic
mood lately, and I’m thinking that get-
tingback in touchwith my childhood
will snap me out of the trance, and
what better way to revisit my youth
than with the recent release of “Where
the Wild Things Are?”

Unfortunately, all my ﬁiends are
either too busy to go to the movies
(sincewhendoes beingasenior imply
responsibility and work ethic?), have
no interestinseeing“WTWI‘A” or are

_ waitinguntil the longqueue ofhipsters

has gone down —— and their fellow
moviegoers have showered recently.
Yes hipsters, it might be time to dis-
prove that unfortunate stereotype.
My friends fail me when it comes
to indulging in this ﬁlm fantasy, as
none ofthemarepretentious hipsters.
I’ve burdened myselfwith genuinely
friendly, non-conceited and well-ad-
justed comrades. No one will go see
, “Wild Things” with me tonight, which

is why I’m desperately seeking a hip-
ster guy to take me to the movies.

Let’s take a second to deﬁne this
whole hipster paradigm. Because of
the negative connotation, it pains
me that the word has become syn-
onymous foranyone with a creative
fashion sense.

start scribbling angry hate mail, let
me say this: I feel for you. I like being
ahead of the curve as much as the next

asymmetrically hair—styled kid. And .

I genuinely appreciate your style. I’m
the ﬁrst to champion unique fashion
statements. I actually harbor a secret
desire for the ability to pull off tor-

 

For the record, just because you have good
taste in clothing, movies or music, that doesn’t

make you a hipster.

For the record, just because you
have good taste in clothing, movies or
music, that doesn’t makeyouahipster.
It’s what you do with this previously
aforementioned good taste that clas-
siﬁes you as such. Hipsters use their
pop-culture knowledge for evil rather
than good, sniping at anyone not as
knowledgeable as them.

Before all you Pitchfork-lovingkids

just about any1:hing~ I just dont have
the right face shape.

I’ve been trying to ﬁnd a ﬂuores-
cent pair of Nike Dunks for months
now, but every time I try them on,
they simply look ridiculous. I envy
you. Don’t go and get your keﬂiyeh

this one time inﬁrstgrade whenthe whole class
gathered on the carpet to listen to Miss Adams

devastatingly bored, though, because my mother

consumed it cover to cover, already laughed at
the punch lines and already looked at all the
brightly colored pictures of toucans. When the
restofthe class would laugh atthe boaconstric-

So if any hipster boy out there is reading
this and needs someone to accompany him to

From real piﬁa coladas to partying with Diddy, Roth keeps it real

Pennsylvania native Asher Roth discusses his big break into rapper stardom

Jordan Streussnig
Staff Writer

When you hear the name Asher Roth, so many
nights of mayhem might swarm to your mind

. , faster than college kids to a South Oakland

house party.
But this popular West Chester, Pa.-based

rapper will be the ﬁrst to tell you —— he’s so
much more than that.

“People are quick to write you off as a one-
hit wonder, but there’s aperson underneath all

this. It’s not just ‘I Love College,”’ Roth said.
Having grown up in a middle-class family
in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Roth brings
a unique point of view to his subject matter
every time he approaches the microphone.
Street violence and hip—hop culture were not
salient influences in Roth’s childhood, so these
topics are not a focus in the music he puts
out today.
Roth’s online rnixtape, Tbe_ Green/youse Ef-
ﬁn‘, hosted by DJ Drama and D] Don Cannon,
includes songs like “Black Mags,” which is a
comical and relatable recap of his youth. Other

tracks, such as “just Listen,” take a more seri-
ous tone and call for us to look past politics,
race, religion and other outside factors to see
people for what they are — fellow human be-
ings, our peers. ,

“I speak for the commoners,” Roth said of
his mix of lighthearted and poignant lyrics. “I
want people to think of my music as relatable,
fun, witty and lyrical.”

But how did a white kid from the suburbs-

who describes his biggest challenge as getting
people to take him seriously join the ranks of
some of the biggest names in rap?

It’s quite simple — he took a chance.
During his sophomore year at West Ches-

ter University, located outside Philadelphia, >

Roth sent a Myspace friend request to Scooter
Braun, anAtlanta—based promoter. '

After listening to Roth’s music on Myspace,
Braun contacted the artist.

“Within a week, he asked me if I could ﬂy
myself down to Atlanta to talk to him, and I
did,” Roth said. 4

“It was one of -those things where he just
showed interest, and I took the opportimity
and ran with it. It was something about that
movie  what’s it called  ‘Borat.’ The spon-
taneity of that movie,” Roth said, “inspired
me to go for it.” ‘

This all took place only about a year ago,
and since, Roth has been living almost an en-
tirely different life. He went from living the
lyrics of the college anthem to hanging out

‘ with the likes of Ludacris and Diddy.

“Going to P. Diddy’s house for the ﬁrst time
was probably one of the craziest experiences
I’ve had over the past year,” Roth said.

“We had a steak dinner, rode jet skis and *

drank p.ina coladas with real coconut,” he said,
“It was so surreal.”

Roth kicked off the homecoming festivities ‘

at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania two
weekends’ ago and will continue a series of
college concerts next week at West Virginia"

‘University and SUNY, Delhi, in New York.

Olympic complex gets name

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ” Writer

The Olympic sports facility currently
under construction across fromTrees
Hall will be known as the Petersen
Sports Complex, athletic director Steve

, Pedersen announced yesterday.

It’s named after John Petersen,
a 1951 Pitt graduate, and his wife
Gertrude, who together gave a large

A donation to Pitt so the new baseball,

softball and men’s and women’s soc-
cer complex could begin to be built
earlier this year.

In 2002, the Petersens’ charity
made the construction of the Petersen
Events Center possible. They reached

out again in 2006 when they started I

an endowment supporting research
in nanoscale science and technology
at Pitt’s Institute of Nanoscience and

Engineering, also in their name as the
John M. Petersen Institute ofNanoSci—
ence and Engineering.

“The extraordinary support that
Pitt has received fromjohn and Ger-
trude Petersenhasplayedacritical role
ine1evatingourUniversity on many im-
portant fronts,” Pitt Chancellor Mark
N ordenberg said in a news release.

The new sports complex, being
built on 12 acres on Pitt’s upper cam-
pus, will provide Pitt’s student athletes
with resources they’ve never had be-
fore. The baseball and softball stadi-
ums both include lighting, hitting and

' pitching practice areas,  a press

box and synthetic and artiﬁcial grass.

A The soccer stadium will have similar

amenities.

“For years we have had a dream to
constructasports complexthatwould
give our baseball, softball andmen’s
andwomen’s soccerteams the kind of

facilities that will allow them to com-
pete for Big East championships on a
regularbasis,” Pederson said. “The gift
from the Petersens has helped make
this dream a reality.”

Petersen graduated from Pitt with
a degree in business administration
and was a member of the swim and
dive team. He is the retired president
of the Erie Insurance Group, where his
expertise helped raise the company’s
assets from $20 million in1962to more
than $4.6 billion when he retired in
1995-

‘“I‘he University of Pittsburgh is a
world-class institution, led by a great
chancellor in Mark Nordenberg and
his outstanding leadership team, that

i has brought Pitt to the pinnacle of ex-

cellence in so many different areas,”
Petersensaid.“Itisagreatpleasurefor
Gertrude and metoagaincontributeto
the University’s success and ﬁiuire.”

A win against USF gives Pitt its best start since 1982

Handling History

' Friday’s win over Rutgers improved
Pitt’s recordto 6-1 overall and3-0 inBig
East play. The last time the Panthers

started 6—1wasthreeyears ago, butPitt '

fans should hope that similarities with
the 2006 season end this week.

In 2006, Pitt won six of its ﬁrst
seven games and then proceeded to
lose ﬁve consecutive Big East games.
The Panthers ﬁnished the season 6-6
and weren’t invited to a bowl game.

DuringMonday’s press conference,

. coach Dave Wannstedt indicated that

the failure of 2006 isn’t on his mind.

“If you wouldn’t have told me, I .

wouldn’t have even remembered to
be quite honest with you,” Wannstedt
told reporters.

“It’s a new year. We hadrl’t beat
Louisville since 1983 down there. We
hadn’tbeat Rutgers inﬁve years, [but]

. we did it. This is a different football

team. It’s adifferentyearand [past fail-
ures] really have no bearing on what
we’re doing.”

Ifthe Panthers defeat South Florida

on Saturday; it would mark the ﬁrst

time Pitt is 7-1 since 1982. I

While Wannstedt doesn’t want to
revisit past struggles, he doesn’t mind
mirroring positive achievements in
program history.

f‘You’re always looking for extra
carrots out there to chase and to go
after,” Wannstedt said. “That’s all part
of the experience of trying to accom-
plish things that haven’t been done in
awhile.”

Avictoryover South Floridawould
be anotherbenchmarkinWannstedt’s
journey to restore Pitt to national
prominence, which was his promise
when he took over the program in
2005.

“[It’s] human nature. You want to
‘accomplish something that has never
been done or you want to accomplish
something that hasn’t been done in a
long time. I think those things are all
healthy things to talk abou ” Wannst-
edt said.

The Blue Movement

Apartfrom the normal Homecom-
ingfestivities that surround Saturdays
contest, athletic director Steve Peder-
son has a request for Panther fans.

Pederson announced Pitt’s “Turn
it Blue” initiative, which asks Panther
fans to wear blue to the game against
South Florida A

According to Pederson, the idea
was derived from letters that he re-
ceived from students who wanted to
unite thefans atHeinz Field under one
uniform color. - _

Studentswillbe providedwith blue
T—shir1s upontheirarrivalatthe game,
and all other fans are being asked to

break out their blue wardrobe.
ItisPederson’s hope that Saturday’s

1 gameisareminderofthePanthers’ role

in Pittsburgh’s sporting landscape.

“lthinkitfs ﬁtting at the time where
Pittsburgh has been chosen the No. 1
Sports City in America [by Sporting
News] that we continue to celebrate all
aspects of this, including the fact that
Pitt football is such an important part
of the history and fabric of this city,”
Pederson said.

“Mack” Daddy

Dorin Dickerson is continuing his
torrid scoringpace and isbeginning to
receive national recognition for it.

Earlier this week, Dickerson was
included in thejohn Mackey midsea-
sonwatch list Thejohn MackeyAward
is presented to the nation’s best tight
endby the Nassau County Sports Com-
mission.

Dickerson joins 21 other players
who arebeingtaken into consideration
for the award.

Through seven games, Dickerson
leads the Big East and is tied for ﬁrst
in the nation with eight touchdown
receptions. In total, Dickerson has 27
receptions for 274 yards.

The last Panther to catch eight
touchdowns during a single season
was Oderick Turner during his 2006
freshman year. A Pitt tight end hasn’t
caught eight touchdowns since Kris
Wilson collected nine in 2003.

Barnes and Lucas set Pitt

records at Blue-Gold meet

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

Jake Lucas and Laura Barnes both
broke school records when the Pitt
swimming and diving team held its
Blue-Gold Meet Oct. 9.

“Both of ]ake’s and Laura’s
swims and records were very, very
impressive,” coach Chuck Knoles
said. “It’s a big deal, we make it a
big deal with the kids. They under-
stand what they’ve done is signiﬁ-
cant, and it gives them a spring-
board for the regular season.”

The Blue-Gold meet is a way
to work out the team’s preseason
kinks before the regular season
started at St. Bonaventure on Oct. '
17.

“It’s a meet that you do within
your squad to give your freshmen a
chance to see what it’s like to swim
in a college meet,” Knoles said. “It
gives you a chance to pick up on
areas as a coach that need to be
worked on before you get to real
competition. It’s very similar to
the spring football game, it’s very
traditional.” ‘

Lucas broke a seven-year meet
record in the 100-meter freestyles
setting a time of 46.01 seconds.
Mike Grube set the previous record
at 46.06.

, Barnes then got in on the re-
cord-breaking action by turning in
a time of 2:19.11 in the 200-meter‘
breast, almost a three-second
improvement over the previous

Zellous f1llS in at starter during the playoffs

The Pitt graduate helped the WNBA’s Detroit Shock make the Eastern Conference finals in her rookie season

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

When back pain sidelined the Detroit
Shock’s Katie Smith for the WNBA
playoffs, former Pitt basketball star
Shavonte Zellous knew she hadto step
up for the team.

Zellous averaged 15.6 points per
game during the postseason, improv-
ing upon her 11.9 average during the
regular season. Smith was second on
the Shockthis season, with 13.7 points
per game, and is the WNBA’s third all-
time leading scorer behind Lisa Les-I

lie and Tina Thompson with a career ’

5,446 points.

Zellous also grabbed two more
rebounds per game and reduced her
turnovers from 2.26 to 1.4 per game.

“My teammates told me, ‘You aren’t -

arookie anymore,’ andlwaslike, ‘Yes,
I am!”’ Zellous said‘. “I‘didn’t play like a
rookie on the floor [though] .”
Zellous found herselfwith an in-
creased role in the playoffs because
of the Shock’s depleted roster. Besides
Smith, the Shock were also without
forward Plenette Pierson, who aver-
aged a little less than 10 points per

is

game the previous season, when the
Shock won their third WNBA title in
the past sixyears. She said she feltlike
she needed to increase her scoring,
because such a big part of the offense

was missing. However, Zellous made -

sureto credit guard Deanna Nolanfor
leadingthe teamto the Eastern Confer-
ence ﬁnals. -

Zellous, the No.11overalldraftpick,
was the lowest draft selection to be
namedto the WNBA’s all-rookie team.
Duringthe regular season, Zellouswas
second among rookies in points per
game, f1nishingbehindAtlanta’s Angel
McCoughtry’s 12.8 points a game.

“I put the expectations high for
myself,’-’ Zellous said. “I wanted to
be on -the all—rool<ie team, or even
to get Rookie of the Year. its a great
honor.” -

After becoming the first rookie to
start for Detroit since 2003, Zellous
hit her stride when shewas moved to a
reserve position abouttwo weeks into
the season. She hasn’t played much like
a rookie since.

Inherﬁrst game offthe bench, Zel-
lous netted 13 points against Indiana.
Inthe next game, she scoredaseason-
high 25 against Atlanta.

‘‘The ﬁrst two games I started ,and
they kind of threw me into the ﬁre,”
Zellous said. “Iwas kind of nervous go-
ingin. Itwasmyﬁrstyearandthiswas
a championship team. Then I saw how

' itwas, andIthought,‘Icanmanagethis

lead by example,” Zellous said. “The

playoffs are something every player’

dreams of, and I think we did a good
job getting to the Eastern Conference
championship without two key play-
ers.”

My teammates loved my excitement and my energy.

and hang with the big dogs.”’

In the postseason, she scored 21
and 23 points in consecutive wins to
close out a ﬁrst-round series against
Atlanta and then opened the confer-
ence ﬁnals against Indiana. She fol-
lowed those games with a 19-point
performance in a loss to the Indiana
Fever, who would win the next game
to eliminate Detroit .

“I think I grew as a person after
leaving college, especially maturity
wise,” Zellous said. “On the court, I

Zellous said her energy as a reserve

“My teammates loved my excite-
ment and my energy. They looked for
me to come off the bench and keep
things rolling,” Zellous said. “I would
come in and take care of business.”

She said she wants to continue her
rookie success next season, especially
because she’s been told that many play-
ers drop off during their second year
in the league. _

“I’m not lookingto do that,” Zellous
said. “I want to keep progressing, and
Iwant to do somethingextra, whether

‘ record set by Lindsey Tiberio in 2004.

In the 100-meter breast, Barnes also
came in ﬁrst, leading the Blue squad to a
142.5-132.5 victory over the Gold team.

In similar fashion, Lucas claimed two
individual ﬁrst—place performances: with a
lircime of 50.99 in the 100-meter ﬂy, and as
a member of the 200-meter medley relay
team to lead the men’s Blue team to a 152-117
victory in the meet.
Lucas, who is academically ineligible for
the fall semester, set the freshman Pitt re-

  
  
 
  
 
 
  
    
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
    
   
  

cord last year and ﬁnished ninth in the Big
East Championship in the 100-meter ﬂy.

“Jake has done a great job growing up
through his freshman year,” Knoles said.
“He’s a great competitor and we expect him
to have a phenomenal sophomore year when
he rejoins us injanuary.”

Barnes, Knoles said, is building off her
strong performancein last year’s Big East
Championship.

“She had a school record in the 200-
meter breast stroke at the Big East Cham-

pionships,” Knoles said. “I think that gave
her an idea of how successful she could
actually be.”

The one constant between the two swim-
mers is their almost complete understanding
of body positioning and speed.

“Both of them are very smart swimmers,”
Knoles said. “They understand their bod-
ies, where they are in relationship to the
lanes. A big’ obstacle in swimming is get-
ting over ﬁghting for air and paying more
attention to breathing than moving faster

Since the Blue—Gold meet, Barnes and
the women’s squad have had some early-
season success. The women dominated
against St. Bonaventure Oct. 17, winning
every event en route to a 254-44 victory to
start the season. 7

Barnes ﬁnished with a time of 2:26.91
in the 200-meter breast stroke, but Knoles
acknowledged the pool at St. Bonaventure
is more like a “typical high school pool,”
making it a tough pool to swim in.

Freshman Liz Tabor was named.Pitt’s per-
former of the meet, winning the day’s ﬁrst
event, the 1,000—meter free wall in 10:27.65.
Joanna Budzis won the 200-meter freestyle
(1:54.33) and 200—meter individual medley
(2:10.07), and senior Ryann Kishbaugh won
the 100-meter back (58.57) and 2.00-meter

. back stroke (2:04.78). .

Margo Ekstrom won both diving events,

0 taking the 1—meter with 246.97 points and

the 3~meter with a score of 261.45. _

On the men’s side, freshman Hussein
Medhat Mohamed was Pitt’s top performer
of the meet, taking the 100-meter and 200-
meter freestyle in the men’s 159-139 victory
against St. Bonaventure.

Mohamed was also part of the Pitt’s win-
ning 400-meter freestyle relay team, along
with Alex Kubicek, Andrzej Dubiel andjustin
Corvin. Dubiel also won the 100-meter and
200—meter backstroke.

Zane _McLain won both diving events,
scoring 279.30 points on the 1—meter board
and 260.85 points on the 3-meter board.

The Panthers next meet is home against
