  Scholarship  

Cristina ‘Holtzer
' Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt senior David Palm is a triple major in
chemical engineering, chemistry and phi-
losophy of science and a national award vvin— y
ner, but he still has time for other esteemed
pursuits, including club soccer and learning
to play the guitar. _

“Its not that crazy, I guess,” Palm said. “I
have four hours of class a day. You do what you
have to get done in whatever time you have.”

Palm is one of 14 American students this
year to win the Churchill Scholarship, an
award supportedby the Winston Churchill
Foundation of the United States. He will move
to the University of Cambridge in the United
Kingdom in October to complete his master’s
degree in chemistry.

In some ways, Palm’s extracurriculars will
even help him reach success abroad.

“I played club soccer for a couple years. I’m

' trying to stay sharp because~I know they’re

pretty good at that sport over in the U.K.,”
he said. -

Palm will also continue his research in
alternative energy technology through
Churchill College, Cambridge University’s

Honors College to‘ offer new scholarships

Chris Puzila
Staff Wrz'ter

[Scholarship money can be difficult to come
by for students, especially if the receipt of
awards is dependent solely on their high
school records. .

But anew program will help students
who may be worthy of a scholarship, though

for various reasons did not receive one.
Pitt’s UniversityHonors College Scholar-

ship Program will award 40 scholarships,

each worth $2,000 for tuitionsupport, to

students who have participated in the Hon?
» ors College by taking honors courses, living

in honors housing, serving as an Honors
College ambassador or receiving any fel-
lowships oﬁ'ered,.among other activities.

Honors College Dean Edward Stricker

dents who excelled in their courses but did
not receive scholarship aid upon admission.
He said the Honors College has previously
given a small number of scholarships to
undergraduates, but a recent availability

of funds spurred the new program.

“Often, [students] were ‘late bloomers’
who were doing much better than anyone
might have predicted from their high school
credentials,” Stricker said in an email. “We
could reward their development and ac-
complishments in college.”

A foundation, which preferred to remain
unidentiﬁed, donated funds to the Honors
College for this purpose, according to Gor-
don Mitchell, assistant dean of the Honors
College. The Honors College invested the
funds as endowment income and allocated
interest from the endowment toward the
scholarships.

Applicants must be junior, senior or
ﬁfth—year students who have completed

a minimum of two full semesters at Pitt’s
Oakland campus, possess at least an overall
3.5 GPA and have not obtained previous
merit scholarships from Pitt’s Office of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid. g

Mitchell said in an email that the schol-
arships will “favor those students with out-
standing track records at Pitt who have not
yet received merit scholarship support.”

' The program will also beneﬁt students
who transferred to the University or applied
too late to be consideredlfor a scholarship
upon admission, according to the Univer-
sity Honors'College website.

The Honors College Advisory Board,
which consists of six members, selects
which applicants will receive scholarships.

Two members represent each of the
three divisions of the School of Arts and
Sciences: humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences. Eachlyear, the Arts and

Sciences department faculty elect three
new faculty members to sit on the Board
for two-year terms.

Mitchell said the college decided to dis-
tribute 40 scholarships because it seemed
the appropriate number to give for maxi-
mum effectiveness.

“We aimed for a sweet spot that spread
award resources broadly, yet thick enough
to make a real ﬁnancial difference,” he said.

According to the Honors College web-
site, the board will also consider applicants’

‘current academic performance, strength

of required faculty recommendations and
responses to application questions such as,
“How has participation in the University

Palm said his research is “tryingto capture so- _

lar energy in order to produce chemical fuels.”

Last year, Palm worked in Pitt’s Swanson
engineering lab with chemical engineering
professor Giitz Veser on developing another
type of clean energy source: chemically cap-
turing the carbon dioxide in the air to reduce
the effects of greenhouse gasses.

Veser watched as the senior adopted the
project, inwhich they ‘ideveloped nanomateri—
als and [carbon dioxide] solvent material with
the aim to come up with a faster and more
efficient way to capture [carbon dioxide] from

the atmosphere.”

“He basically took over the project that
a post—doctoral student had started,” Veser
said.

Although Veser said the carbon diox-
ide research is not quite ﬁnished, Palm has
written a draft of a paper that will report the
results so far.

Palm said he became interested in differ-
ent types of energy sources while shopping
for his ﬁrst car during high school in Cham-

pion, Ohio. He said he didn’t want “one of V

those big clunky SUVs,” but instead a small
car to ‘get the job done.

After taking chemistry and physics classes
in high school, he began to hear about climate
change in the news. A

“That kind of all came together to get me -

excited,” Palm said.

As a sophomore, Palm joined Engineers
for a Sustainable World, a nonproﬁt organi-
zation based in Pittsburgh that implements
projects to make college campuses more
energy efficient and eco-friendly.

He participated in projects on Pitt’s cam-
pus, including the construction of a rain gar-
den on the lawn of the Petersen Events Center
to prevent ﬂooding after heavy rainstorms.

Palm also utilized summerbreaks to par-
ticipate in research endeavors that landed
him in a lab on Penn State’s main campus one

summer and a study abroad opportunity in ,

Australia for another.

But Palm was always happy to juggle his
commitments.

“Fitting in these other organizations and
interests was something I wanted to do, so it
didn’t seem like a burden,” he said.

Palm enrolled in a basic chemical engi-
neering course taught by Robert Parker, Pitt
associate professor of chemical and petro-
leum engineering, during his sophomore
year.

Palm sat in the back row.

The following year, Palm sat with a group
of “very talented people” in Process Dynam-
ics and Control, one of Parker’s more ad-
vanced classes, according to the professor.

One of those people included last year’s
Whitaker Award winner, Lisa Volpatti.

Volpatti is now at Churchill College study-

ing biochemical engineering.

Parkerwas enthusiastic that “two people
who sat at the same table in [his] class” ended
up studying at Cambridge. '

Palm applied for several fellowships that,
according to Veser, all look for many of the
same qualities in a candidate —— perhaps most
importantly, initiative.

“I’ve had many undergraduate research-
ers in my lab. David is certainly among the
very best that I’ve seen there,” Veser said.
“What differentiated him most from other
students is that he showed a lot of initiative.”

While Palm is not certain of his ﬁiture
plans, he said he’d like to focus on inventing
a sustainable renewable energy source and
then possibly go into academia.

While he said he is a little nervous about
moving to the U.K., Palm said he’s excited to
work with some of the world’s leading experts
in the ﬁeld of sustainable energy engineering.

“My primary training hasn’t been in
chemistry. I think I’m going to have to do
some brushing up,” he said. “I’ve heard there
are some pretty smart people over at Cam-
bridge.” |

COLUMN

Carnivore-dominant World imposes
diverse palette of concerns

Nick Voutsinos
Columnist

Cuisine has a way_ of deﬁning us.
It helps us expound our cultural
identity in the -same way music
or dialect might. As French phi-
losopher and gastronomejean An-
thelme Brillat-Savarin put it, “Tell

' me what you eat, and I will tell you

what you are.”

I think there’s a lot of truth to
that. After all, deep-dish pizza ver-
sus thin crust pizza, for instance,
clearly separates Chicagoans and
New Yorkers on culinary borders.
In this case, one’s pizza preference
is distinctly associated with one
city or the other, just as much as
one’s accent is. People take pride
in what deﬁnes them and in what
they grew upwith, simply because
it is what makes them unique from
other groups. That is where the
cultural signiﬁcance in food can
be found.

Even though cuisine is vastly
different across the world, the
international community undeni-
ably shares a love of meat. Granted,
not everyone agrees on what kind
or how to prepare it: Germans
munch on bratwurst, the Chinese
perfect roast duck and Americans
love a good burger. Nonetheless,
although food provides us with a
sense of belonging, the shared ap-
petite for meat, in particular, has
created a global crisis.

Over the past few decades,
global meat consumption has
been growing at a dramatic rate.
As the demand for meat continues
to grow, so, too, does the indus-
trialization of farming methods,

creating health and ethical conse-
quences that may make one want to
choose vegetarian options instead.

That is not to say everyone
should go vegetarian, but instead
means to highlight the fact that
overconsumption is a problem.
And not just in the United States:
Even India, a traditionally more
vegetarian country, has seen their
meat consumption skyrocket over
the past few years.

The ramiﬁcations of a world full
of carnivores are visible in the fact
that 70 percent of the arable land
in the world is now being used to
grow food — not for humans, but

for animals who will eventually be .

served in the form of McNuggets or
Whoppers. This has exacerbated
starvation/and poverty in the third
world, as corporate interests push
subsistence farmers off their lands.
Consequently, these small farm-
ers are left with cruddy leftover
grounds for their animals to graze
on. This is a largely detrimental
concern to the livelihoods of the
70 percent of the 880 million rural
people in the world living on less
than $1 per day, who are partially or
completely dependent on livestock
for food security.

Many nongovernmental or-
ganizations have taken notice of
this. For instance, according to Paul
Rainger, head of the World Soci-
ety for the Protection of Animals’
Farm Animal Welfare Program,
the industrialization of the meat
industry is one of the “root causes”
of hunger and poverty. He claims
that, “Unless urgent action is taken,
the UN’s No. 1 millennium goal to
halve [world hunger] by 2015 will
never be achieved.”

‘ -- He references the use of arable
land solely for animal feed to back
up his assertion, “Switching just
10 to 15 percent of the world’s ce-
real production for animal feeds

to growing crops for human con-
sumption, instead, would make a
huge impact on world hunger.”

Still, the demand for meat re— i

mains. For instance, in the United
States, more than 165 pounds of
meat is devoured per person every

_ year. In Germany it’s 132 pounds

per person and in China it’s 84. To

“keep up with demand as cheaply

as possible, meat companies have
resorted to pumping their animals
full of antibiotics and hormones in
order to make them live longer and
grow larger, eﬂiciently producing
a greater yield.

The ﬁnal result of this geneti-
cally modiﬁed product, however, is
of course extremely unnatural and
damaging to the consumer’s health.
In fact, of the six growth hormones
commonly used by the industry, all
have been‘ shown to signiﬁcantly
increase prostate and colon cancer
in unsuspecting consumers. And I
say “unsuspecting” because meat
producers are not required to list
the hormones that their product is
riddled with. p

They are also not required to
list the antibiotics used on their
industrialized meat, even though
they also contribute dramatic
harms to public health. And meat
companies use a copious amount
of the stuff. It is estimated that
70 percent of all antibiotics used
in the United States are admin-
istered to factory farm animals.
The constant usage of antibiotics
in animals has prompted bacteria
to mutate and become resistant to

. the medicine. This is not only bad

for the animals —— as factory farms
are already breeding grounds for
disease due to overcrowding of

livestock — but it also affects humans
when the bacteria strays outside of the
factory farm. Consequently, the meat
industry has contributed to the 90,000
Americans who die every year as a result
of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections
that originally spawned in factory farms.

Moreover, even if you do not eat meat
and even if you are not a subsistence
farmer, the meat industry still affects
your life in at least one way: Factory farms

are one of the world’s most prominent
producers of greenhouse gases. They
are also the world’s biggest producers

of animal waste —producing 1 million

tons of manure each. day in the United
States alone —which releases into the
air methane and nitrous oxide, chemicals
that are 25 and 300 times more efﬁca—
cious_than carbon dioxide, respectively.
Of course,_ it’s not so much the animals,
themselves, that are the problem, but
that a great number of them arebeing

stitute — a nongovernmental organiza-
tion dedicated to spreading awareness
on humanitarian and environmental is-
sues — stated, “The world’s super-sized
appetite for meat is among the biggest
reasons greenhouse gas emissions are
still growing rapidly.”

However, he also states that, “properly
managed and scaled meat production
4- like the kind pursued by small—scale
pastoralists on dry grasslands —— could
actually sequester carbon dioxide. It’s
largely a matter of rethinking meat at
both ends of the production-consumption
trail.”

I think he’s right, for there seems to
exist a very strong correlation between
meat consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions, as well as between meat con-
sumption and poverty and public health.

Therefore, in order to curb these is—
sues, a paradigm shift may be in order. We
can still love the foods that deﬁne us, but
we can do so within reason. 165 pounds of
meat per person is hardly necessary. And
limiting meat consumption will not only
garner the thanks of the world, but of the
animals that are currently crammed into
ﬁlthy factory farm pens, as well. I

the line between toe—tapping, poppy surfer

No. 2 Syracuse, No. 20 Pit reain aop conference

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staﬁ’ Writer

Three teams -— Virginia, Clemson and
Duke -—— have provided hope for the ACC.
These squads have recently emerged as
middle—of—the-pack teams, proving that
the conference consists of more than Syra-
cuse, Pitt and 13 second—rate members —
at least for now.

Meanwhile, Syracuse is in a heated
battle with Arizona and Wichita State to
be the last unbeaten team in the nation,
but they are the overwhelming favorites
to lose ﬁrst. .

Arizona has played only one ranked
opponent (Duke), and it might not face
another until the NCAA tournament.
Meanwhile, Wichita State is knee-deep in
one of the easiest con.ference schedules
in the country. The Shockers are_ coming
off a 20-point win oyer. Indiana State, the
Missouri Valley Conference’s No. 2 team.

Conversely, the Orange will face Miami
and Wake Forest before hitting the meat
of their schedule, which includes games
against Duke, Clemson, Notre Dame and

Nonetheless, they sit atop the ACC and

-A ; Freshman point guard Tyler Ennis cre-

ated quiteva national buzz after a 16-point
second-half performance, which included

six points in the ﬁnal 1:48 to lift Syracuse
to a 59-54 win over Pitt on Saturday. Last
week, Ennis averaged 14 points, four as-
sists and 3.5-steals while playing all 40
minutes of both games, earning him his
third ACC Rookie of the Week award. He
has also been deemed by_ countless college
basketball analysts as the season’s most
valuable freshman. Ennis ranks sixth in
the nation with 48 steals and sets up senior
forward C.J. Fair’s 16.8 points per game
with his 4.13 assist-to-turnover ratio, good
for fourth in the country. ‘ ‘

No. 20 Pitt (17-2, 5-1 ACC)

It’s rare to see a team move up in the
polls after a loss ~—- especially Pitt, who was

Pitt wrestling trailed Oklahoma State 7-0
after the first two matches in Sunday’s
dual meet before two freshmen stepped
up to save the match for the Panthers.
Edgar Bright, ranked No. 13 in the
141—pound weight class, put Pitt on the
board with a 10-5 decision over Okla-

homa State’s -No. 12.Anthony Collica.

Bright set the stage for fellow fresh-
man Mikey Racciato, a 149’P0under,
who pinnedjosh Kindig at 1:23. His fall
ended up breaking the 18-18 tie, giving
the underdog Panthers a victory over
the No. 5 Cowboys.

Senior heavyweight P.]. Tasser spoke
highly of the young Panthers.

“Both Edgar and Mikey’s wins against

Oklahoma State were pivotal, especially
the pin,” Tasser said. “Ithink it gives

them an immense amount of confidence -

moving forward.”

V Considering Bright and Racciato are
members of Pitt’s 2013 recruiting class,
which ranked second in the nation, their
success isn’t shocking. Regardless, the

upperclassmen have taken notice ofthe .

“It’s great having two freshman in the

FOOTBALL

Pitt learns dates of 2014
1 ACC football games

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

The Atlantic Coast Conference released its
2014 football schedule Wednesday, reveal-
ing the dates Pitt will meet their opponents
in the team’s second year of ACC play.
Pitt’s ﬁrst conference game will be
played on Sept. 5 in a Friday-night game
at Boston College. The Golden Eagles are
the Panthers’ crossover opponent from the
Atlantic Division for the upcoming season.
Home conference games for the 2014
season include Virginia Tech, Georgia

Tech, Duke and Syracuse. The Oct. 25 con-’

test against the Hokies will likely highlight
Pitt’s home schedule.

From afar, the Panthers’ most challeng-
ing game will likely be their away game in
Miami to close out the season on Nov. 29.

Pitt also visits Virginia and North Carolina.
While the on—ﬁeld product is still un-
known and the Panthers must replace
graduating players and improve in certain
positions, a higher win total seems within
Pitt’s reach in 2014 when comparing their
upcoming schedule with last season’s.

Another favorable aspect of the
schedule is the gap between the team’s
bye weeks. In 2014, the Panthers will not
play the weeks of Oct. 11 and Nov. 8. Last
season, the Panthers had to play eight
consecutive games after bye weeks early
in the season.

Pitt’s nonconference schedule includes
home matchups with Delaware, Iowa and
Akron, along with a road contest against
Florida International Sept. 13. The Pan-
thers open their season at home against
Delaware on Aug. 30. 5

that Bright always desired.

“It?s what my team and coaches ex-
pect of me,” Bright said. “Making an ear-
ly impact was my goal. I came inxknowing
that I wanted to be in the lineup, making
things happen for the team.” ‘"

Racciato, on the other hand, didn’t
necessarily focus on making early con-
tributions, but his wrestling style has
made him very effective in his first year
of collegiate competition.

“Making an impact early was never
really one of ‘my goals,” Racciato said.
“Once I knew I was starting, I just ﬁg-
ured I would continue the way I always
wrestled. That’s what got me here in the
ﬁrst place, and hopefully I would find
similar success.”

Despite their differing outlooks, the
two share a common goal: to help the
team win as many matches as possible.

“All I’m really trying to do is take it

_ one match at a time and ‘hopefully win,”
Racciato said. “It’s always a great feeling

January 28, 2014 The Pitt News I vvvwv.pittnevvs.com

to know you are helping benefit your
team.” V .
Bright knows his role in the lineup

V and has embracedlit.

“Winning key matches shows me that
I’m doing my job in the lineup,” Bright
said. “Plus, it helps me see where I stand
when it comes to tough competition.”

That tough competition —— which has
included No. 5 Oklahoma State and No.

. 1 Penn State so far this season and will

culminate with matches against No. 12
Michigan, No. 13 Virginia, No. 14 Ed-
inboro and No. 17 Virginia Tech — has
toughened the young Panthers against
the rigors of collegiate wrestling.

“You have to keep the young guys mo-
tivated all the way till March because
it is such a long season,” Zanetta said.
“With success comes motivation, so it
is making everyone’s job a little easier.”

‘ The tough schedule has kept the un-
derclassmen motivated, but the experi-
enced group of upperclassmen has also
been a driving factor in their success.

Shelton Mack, a 133-pound senior,
said that one thing the upperclassmen
do is lead by example.

“We all have the same goals and stan-
dards, and I feel like that’s important for
the freshmen to see,” Mack said.

With those leaders in place, the young
Panthers know that they have a model
to follow.

“The upperclassmen have been great
role models and leaders,” Racciato said.
“They have made my transition into col-

-’ lege very easy and help keep us young

guys doing the right things.”

Halfway through the wrestling sea-
son, Racciato and Bright have set high
expectations for themselves, and the
upperclassmen said they intend to hold
the starters to those goals.

“It isn’t always going to go smooth
[for the freshmen], but this far into the
season, I think they have realized that
there are no secrets to success in college
wrestling,” Zanetta said.

The Pitt seniors have won a confer-
ence championship — either regular
season or tournament — the past four
years and will look to their newest mem-
bers to contribute this year.

After learning from one of the most
successful senior classes in Pitt history,

    

Racciato and Bright will be set to carry
over those expectations of Pitt wres-
tling to a new group of freshmen. “Even
though they are young, they carry them-
selves on the mat like veterans, and it’s
really paying of ,” Tasser said.

In a matter of years, Bright and Rac-
ciato will lead the team, and Bright looks
forward to stepping into a leadership
role with the knowledge he has gained
from this year’s upperclassmen.

“The upperclassmen have done a lot
for me to get acclimated to the tough
lifestyle of college wrestling,” he said.
