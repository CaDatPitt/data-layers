  SALESMANSHIP AS

How students can make enough, in
heir three months’ vacation, to ﬁnance
themselves during the other nine
months, will be discussed brieﬂy to-
morrow at 12:30 o'clock in Room 9,
State Hall, by L. R. Tripp of Cleve-
land, in talking on the advantages of
salesmanship as a. summer occupation.
Mr. Tripp is outlining an‘ entirely new
plan in summer work for the men or
Pitt and, according to Norman Mac-
Leod of the Employment Bureau, his
talk will be- of special interest to all
men. _ .

“The fact that a man has never sold
3J13‘thing,'_’ says Mr. Tripp, “does not
mean that he can't sell. Every day
you are using basic selling principles
in your ordinary social routine and in
the class-room. To become an expert
salesman is only a matter of knowing
what these principles are and apply-
ing them to best advantage. Vvhen you
are doing that, you are selling your
ability or your product to the best ad-
vantage. The same grade of ability

and intelligence is better paid on the

have contributed ‘two or more members to the University, and a great
group picture of as many of them as possible will be taken in time to
be printed in the commencement issue of the Pitt Weekly, and circu-
lated throughout the newspapers of the country. This is an excellent
opportunity to impress upon the reading public the fact that Pitt is
building up traditions, and that the University‘ is not a young Univer-
sity. There is a tremendous amount of detail work necessary in order
to stage this proposition, and you are asked to co-operate with us by

A sruonur ' ASSEMBLY

I, 1 , The general assembly on last »VVednesday was unusual in the fact

jfiithat it was not only a general assembly but also a student assembly.
 large attendance and the interest displayed proves that assembly
 0 hour is well worth while if only it be made interesting. , The program
'  was noteworthy in that it ‘was incharge of student leaders, was

composed of student speakers and performers, and had a direct appeal

' to the student audience. 0 .
It is thought that the original purpose of assemblies was not to
pro’vi_de a lecture course but to set aside a. time for a general‘ gather-
  of all students on the campus, at which time matters of most vital

P igpinterest to the student body could be discussed.

The Student Senate is to be congratulated for the first assembly

 held under its auspicesand there is no doubt that if future Wed-

fnesday meetings can beconducted in the same way there will be no
‘ further need for the compulsory attendance rule.

The Weekly will conclude with the present school year its series of
sketches of Pitt families—-those Western Pennsylvania families which have
been most intimately associated with the life and growth of the University

and, often, of the community.

No more accurate or comprehensive story of

the University could be told than that which has developed in the history
of these kindreds, from which members of several generations have attended

Western Pennsylvania's oldest and greatest institution of learning.

The

Weekly, has presented this series with real pleasure, and has been gratified
by the interest shown by so many of the alumni and friends of the Univer-
sity in these stories. There are several true Pitt families whose records have
-not been included to date, and we hope to print them before the close of the

miliar with the University’s n.-est re!
cent campus life. One might 50 this:

ning into a more true or loyal'Pitt
man than Alex Stevenson. His name
is associated with our a hlciic prow-
ess, with our general alumni interests,
and with the ﬁne success of the Al-
umni Bullding campaign, in which he
played a very conspicuous part.
HIS BROTHER .

James W. Stevenson, M; D. '12. '

Alex's brother “Jim" began his ail.-,
letic days at the Eldersville Normal!
School and completed his stndiesavl '
his gridiron work at Pitt in 1912. Hi
name occupies a high place on th-
rolls of the football teams of 1908.
1909. 1910 and 1911, during .which
years he did not miss participating in
a single varsity game. This gives him
a record of consistency whit‘: has
‘been equaled by few, if any, of Pitt
athletes. .. '

Dr. Stevenson was an honor man in
his class, is a member of the Nu
Sigma Nu fraternity, and served as a
committeeman in the Alumni Building
Campaign. He is a member of the
Allegheny Medical Society and prom-
inent as a surgeonon the staff of the
Mr.-Keesporl: Hosi ‘lal.

Dr. Stevenson was one of the pion--
eers in the McKeesport gas ﬁeld and
has made many wise _investments
which have brought in good returns,
much to the satisfaction of his many
University and professional friends.

HIS SON

Thomas Stevenson, Col., '23.

Alex's son, in the few short months
he has had on the Pitt campus, has
begun to lay the foundation stone for
a Pitt career which is typically, Stev-
enson in its type. In the South Hills
High School,from which he graduated
last June, Tom was captain of the
football team and played end during
his senior year, and was also a mem-
ber of the baseball and basketball
squads. At the University he has fol-
lowed his athletic activities along the
line of an assistant managership in
connection with this year’s Freshman
football team, and has made a record
which promises him big returns dur-
ing his junior or senior ‘year in con-
nection with Pitt athletics. Tom is a
member of the Phi Gamma Delta fra-_
ternity, having been recognized by
that organization as one of the very
best men of the Freshman class. He
is vice president of the Freshmen
class, belongs to the Cap and Gown
Club, and is sprouting out into many
activities which should make him a.
busy man. With the background es-
tablished in his high school days as
an athlete, class president and debat-
ing captain, he is ‘well prepared to
participate in numerous Pitt projects,
and still do fall justice to his heavy

that men of.-‘his type are always
recognized at Pitt as assets,

rolling mill work, throughout this
period he faithfully enlarged upon his
elementary knowledge of astronomy,
which had been imparted to him as a
boy by his grandfather, Nathaniel
Smith. *

Soon after he came to Pittsburgh
Dr. Brashear was married to Miss
Phoebe Stewart. He conﬁded his am-
bitions to -his wife, and the young
couple planned ways and means for
him to continue his study of astron-
omy. Selecting and purchasing a site
in thexsouth Hills, the young machin-
ist built with"'his own hands a frame
homestead at 3 Holt street. The work
was done in the evenings, after his
mill labors were .over. Often Mrs.
Brashear held a lantern, giving light to
‘her husband, while he sawed and ham-
mered on their house.’ The home was
completed in 1870.

Lacking the means with which to
purchase a telescope he set to Work to
construct one. In 1874 it was com-
pleted in a, little, workshop adjoining
the house. Meanwhile he had left the
Zug & Painter Company to work in
the glass mold plant of Adams & Co.
The experience in the glass works ‘.9
considered invaluable.

After 10 years of experiments and
development in the construction of
telescopic implements he to rn ed
wholly to manufacturing them in 1880.
Until his death he continued. always
experimenting and improving,

The world’s scientific societies hon-
ored him. Among them were the
British Astronomical Society, .Societe
Astronomique de France, the Societe
Astronomique de Belgium, the Ameri-
can Philosophical Society, the Astro-
physical Society of America, the Na-
tional Geographical Society. He was
an honorary member of the Royal As-
tronomical Society of Canada End was
a fellow of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science and
the Royal Astronomical Society of
Great Britain. He was past president.
of the Engineers’ Society of Western
Pennsylvania. and the Pittsburgh
Academy of Science and Art. Wash-
ington and Jefferson College and
Wooster University conferred upon
him the degree of LL. D. Degrees of
Sc. D. were given him by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and Princeton Uni-
vereity.

From‘ 1898 to 1900 Dr. Brashear was
director of the Allegheny Observatory,

searches were carried on under-‘his

ciated with the‘ civic, scientiﬁc and
educational progress of his community,
and he enjoyed from far and wide .-,
love and respect which amounted to
veneration. ’ _

In Pittsburghhe was affectionately
known as “Uncle John.” Pittsburgh
owed much .to the man. The city’s
pride in his accomplishments was
coupled with a warm personal friend-
ship} His kindliness was known to
everyone. , - -

Dr. Brashear’s work and several
articles which he ‘wrote attracted the
attention of the late William Thaw,
one of the patrons of the Allegheny
Observatory. Mr. Thaw induced Dr.
Brashear to move his shops from the
South Side to the North Side, then
Allegheny, and it was in the new shops
that he invented the spectrascope for
astronomic uses. In 1883 he completed

his spectrascope for the 36-inch tele-

scope. The optical parts made in the
Brashear shop were of higher grade
than those previously obtained in‘Ger-
many. '

In later years Dr. Brashear directed
the affairs of the John A. Brashear
Company, limited, 9. concern which he
organizged with his son-in-law, James
B. McDowell. This firm constructed
apparatus for special work, rather
than for commercially proﬁtable pro-
ducts, and it was the boast of its
heads that it had no patents and no
secrets. Whatever was accomplished
in its workshops was given freely to
the world. '

For a number of years Dr. Brashear
was a trustee of Carnegie Institute of
Technology. .

Commenting upon the death of the
aged scientist, Chancellor McCormick
said: “I was closely associated with
Dr. Brashear for more than 16 years,

for the opening of the’ season, less than
Two weeks in the future.
  In spite of the bitter winds that
‘i ‘blew over the top of the hill Coach
pick Harley drove his pupils .through
daily practice, losing as little time as
lffgiossible. The indoor track was used
,1’o'r the workouts, as it was before the
nice stretch of weather that featured
the first week of April.

ofgboth the coach and the _playei_fs to

portunity of indulging in' practice for
"(the past several weeks and have been

Thus far Pitt has _been unable to

figure out just whovwill accompany him
to Athens to meet the Georgians in
these opening games. There is a.

PREPARED l‘llliPliAl1'l|l1E-

No time is to be lost in getting the
courts in shape, so tbatas soon as the
weather permits the candidates may
go right towork and condition them-
selves for the spring season. Men
have been kept busy on the courts for
the past week and,-if they are per-
mitted to continue ‘the work every-
thing will be ready for the candidates
by the last of the present week.

Smith? Monk, Merritt, Smertz and

Lewis of last year’s team will all be '

available, and will be among the ﬁrst
men to report this year. These men
have already been doing some work on
outside courts, so that it will not re-
quire such a long time for them to get
themselves into condition. in addition
to the candidates named above, Doane,
a former Allegheny star, is not regis-
tered in the School of Engineering,
and has been there long enough to

make him eligible for the team. At

the time he was at Allegheny Doane
was one of the best tennis players in
these parts, so it is reasonable to ex-
pect that he will be of great service to!
the Panther-'courtmen this season.

Dr. Stephens, who directed last‘.

year's team, will again have charge of
the men this year. Dr. Stephens is
not only an excellent player himself,’
but he has developed some of the best
racqueters who have ever performed in
and around Pittsburgh.‘ His work last
year was satisfactory from all angles,
especially when it is to be considered
that he moulded a team out of almost
green material, in as much as ‘it was
the first tennis team representing the
University in several years.

‘The-,_ mid-winter weather of the past
weekwforced the track team to spend
another week in me in-door -track.

gust of Coach Kerr, who would _.like to
see the men out doors, in order to be
able to put on the ﬁnishing touches for
the Penn Relays these next two‘ weeks,

The selection of the team for. the
Penn Relays, April 30 and May 1, is as
yet problematical. although the num-
ber of likely candidates is gradually
limiting itself to about seven men.

The appearance of Peters, who has
been doing cooperative work in the
oil ﬁelds, was encouraging, and he has
been working hard the past week. He
claims, however, to be in fine trim,
having tramped an average of 10 miles
daily over the ﬁelds. “Pete” haslmade
the relay team twice in the past, last
year failing only because he started
too late to get into tip-top form. Thus
he may be counted on as practically
sure’, . rovided-he has no difficulty-
worki g back into his old form.

Shea also is sure of his place as
anchor 'man on the team His leg is
still being baked daily by Trainer
Hunter Johnston, but has been giving
him no trouble at all and is working
smoothly. *

Harry Martin appears to be another
certainty. He is in fine form, and as

a name for himself. When in the best
of form he can step. the double-furlong
under 51 seconds. ' .

There will be a hot ﬁght for fourth
position, granting the other three to
Peters, Martin and Shea. Brickley,
Wiegel, Bovard and White all have a
good chance to land and anyone of the
four who shows a sudden outburst .of
speed and form will make himselfthe
sure fourth man. ’

At the outset Brickley would appear
to bethe best bet. Brick is gifted
v ith good long legs, lots of wind fund
plenty of speed. He made the team

last year and ‘should be ableto nego-
tiate" the quarter under 53 seconds.

Bovard in the past has always been
a strong contender and has made his
opponents "exert themselves to the ut-
most.

Ordinarily a distance man, he has an

abundance of speed and will give any.

man a. run for his money in. the qua!‘-1
ter.

necessary speed, and, is not
passed by lightly

Another likely candidate is ‘Doc, .6-
Doc has not done much‘ in...

to be one of their best bets in the ‘

sprints. He may spring asurprise on
the old boys. . .

Coach Kerr ‘isgreatly pleased with r ;,
the promise of Bill Capers, whose year ‘-
of residence is up, to come out for;
track. Capers was formerly at Tulane“.  -i
University, New Orleans, where in J}
”Southern intercollegiate track circles 
he made quite a name ‘for himself. ’ He-.  '
through school"

is working his way
every afternoon, but haspromlsed to
come up two mornings a week and on
Saturday afternoons. -

Capers has done over 22 feet in the
broad jump, and can be used nicely in
that event. At present there is no one
in school capable of doing over 20 feet
consistently. In addition, he is ‘a

sprinter of no mean ability, but lnas-"

much as that department is pretty well
taken care. is, his services lnpthe
sprints may be waived. It would be

impossible for him to get and keep in‘, ',  
with such", .

should be sufficient for him to get in
