Create New Chaos

By IVIATT NESVISKY

A problem of steadily increasing magnitude at the Uni-

versity is the classroom shortage. An official at the Student,

Records office has stated that “about 50 per cent of the

classes for the present trimester are having some type of.

classroom difﬁculty.”

According to Richard Hodges,

Director of Student Rec-

Sorority Rush
Parties Begin

Next Thursday

Two sorority rush parties will
be held Jan. 19 from 6:45 to 8:15
p'.m.‘ and from 8:30 to 10 p.m.

Two final formal rush parties
are scheduled for the following
Friday and’ Saturday nights at 7:30
p.m. Attendance to these rush ev-
ents is by invitation.

A Rushing Education Program
sponsored by the Pan Hellenic
Association- will be held on the
12th "floor, Cl on Jan. 13 at noon
and at 3 p.m. The same program
will be presented on Jan. 16 at
noon. _

The purpose of these meetings
is to answer any questions for
rushees concerning sorority life
and rush activities.

The program will be primarily
a discussion period at which time
Gail Noden, chairman of the
meeting, Barbara Goebler, pres-
ident of Pan Hel, and Mrs. Jean
Aiken, advisor to Pan Hel, will
answer questions and lead the
discussion.

Rushees are urged to read the
material they received before at-
tending the meeting.

In order to give each rushee
an opportunity to decide on the
sorority she wishes to join, Pan
Hel has established a Silence
Period beginning at the close of
the ﬁrst formal rushing party and
extending until the rushee appears
at the headquarters of the soror-
ity of her choice for a ribbon
ceremony. '

Silence Period will not be ef-
fective during the hours of the
formal rushing parties.

¢ords, the problem has become one

of utmost gravity.

“The fact that a tremendous
amount of students registered for
classes only between the hours of
nine and two created a bottle-
neck. There just aren’t enough
classrooms to carry this concen-
trated load.”

Rent Space

One solution to this problem of
a lack of room is renting or buy-
ing classrooms from various in-
stitutions in the Oakland area.

In the Past, the University
has rented classroom space from
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial
Hall, the YM&WI-IA and Logan
Armory. The latter is still be-
ing used today.

' This method, however, results
in great difﬁculties, as students do
not ‘have enough time to get from
one class to another because of
the buildings’ locations.
Balance Schedules

Another alternative which ap-
pears to get closer to the heart of
the matter, is to balance the time
element of the scheduling. Night.
classes, on the consent of instruc-
tors and their students, are being
formulated every day.

Saturday classes are increasing
and by Fall 1961, they are ex-
pected to be solid part of trimes-
ter scheduling.

H o d g e s believes, however,
that building more classrooms
will sooner or later be neces-
sary. “One-third of all con-
struction in this area last year
was classroom building. Pitt
has been lagging; it must be-
come more active in this trend.”

The fact that there are not‘

enough classrooms available to
accommodate every student with

is a problem of the Student Rec-

ords Office.

“Far too many students are un-
informed about the great advant-
ages of working for the govern-
ment.” Ftitenour said.

“This misconception was com-
mon among seniors who attended

interviews. Few Liberal Arts and
Business Administration students
realize the career possibilities
available to them in the Manage-
ment Internship program.”

Feb. 11. The closing date for
applications for this exam is
Jan. 26.

In the past trainees have been
accepted who have graduated

Odds in Favor of Completion

R.O.T.C. Changes Meet

New Demands of Times

The R.O.T.C program at the University is gradually be-
ing changed to meet the demands of changing times.

As before, advanced courses are being offered for soph-
omores after they have been thoroughly screened for ad-
vanced placement. The odds are in favor of completing
ROTC in the advanced courses.

After physical examinations and‘

tests, a civilian and military com-
mittee select the names of the in-
dividuals who have qualiﬁed and
these names are in turn sent to
the deans of the respective schools
for approval. Some have been re-
jected because of academic trou-
ble.

Lt. Paul B. Wolff, Artillery
Chairman, said that the Univer-
sity has a contract with the Army
for this program. About 100 stu-
dents must begin this course each
year and 25 have to become com-
missioned ofﬁcers each year.

Several major curricular modi-
ﬁcations have been suggested by
top military educators and college
presidents meeting in the penta-
gon. These include the complete
elimination of weapons training
the reduction of the M-1 riﬂe
training by 50 per cent to 15
hours, the reduction of junior and
senior year training by three hours
per week, thus saving four credit
payments and three class hours

Baal! Bargain

In conducting a book exchange, the Student Govern-
ment has given the University’s Book Center heavy com-
petition in the selling of used books. The main reason seems
to be that the two have different purposes.

The Book Center employs a semi-rigid formula in deal-
ing with used books. If a student sells a book to the Book
Center, he is paid only 50 per cent of the book’s original
cost. Later this same book is sold at 75 per cent of the cost,
thus allowing a 25 per cent proﬁt for the Book Center.

"This formula has been set up by the wholesale jobbers
in a “blue book.” Although the Book Center admits that
this provides no direct service to the students, they claim

that by abiding by. this rule it enables them to also pur-

chase used books from the jobber. In this way they can

stock up on used books and provide low rates to students. _

It is doubtful‘ whether the Book Center adhers to this
policy as strictly as they claim to. There never seems to
be many used books available at the Book Center——no more
at least than student sales would provide. ‘

A Possibly to remove doubt the Book Center should an-
nounce how many. books they do buy from the jobbers. If

thenumber is not too impressive, it might be wise for

them to abandon this5policy—paying the studenta fairer

price and selling the book at a proﬁt lesstthan 25 per

cent might be to their advantage. ‘ ._
What the Student Government has done, however, is

even better. Their formula is‘ altogether different. Their.
purpose in selling books is not for self-proﬁt but instead for

the student’s proﬁt.
The books which are priced by the original owners
are now on sale in four diﬁerent rooms on the third ﬂoor

of Schenley Hall. The committee conducting the exchange .
_ provides students with information that will help them to

determine a fair price for the used book. The committee
also puts no mark-up on the book. ,

According to Jay Fingeret, chairman of the Book Ex-
change committee, every book which has been sold has

been at a minimum, $1.00 cheaper than those sold in the

Book Center.

From Bad to Wofse

Another Mistake Made

By Rodger D. Yeager

When the 26th of July revolution burst upon
Cuba from the Sierra Madres, American public
opinion ran greatly in favor of it and of its bearded
leader Fidel Castro. The atrocities of Batista had
caused a deep sympathy for the
Cuban people in the United
States, and this antagonist to him
was naturally looked upon as ;
another Simon Bolivar. .

That was in 1958. Since then,
Castro has efficiently effected a
swing in this opinion to the op-
posite end of the spectrum.
American attitude is now one of
disgust toward and disappoint-
ment in the regime. It, indeed,
approaches hate for Cuban poli-
tics and people in general.

Attempted Alienation

It may be conceded that we have good reason,

for this sentiment, Castro has, by every means
available to him, attempted to alienate the United
States, whether it be by blasting the United States
at the United Nations, by insulting our nationals
in Cuba, or by actively soliciting support -from
Communist bloc countries. He has argued to the
other South American countries that Yankee im-
perialism is threatening their very existence and
it must be eliminated, his ‘way. L

He has, ﬁnally, attacked what is perhaps most
close to the American heart, private economic
enterprise in the form of, petroleum and agri-
cultural concerns in Cuba. The motives for this
action are simple. He is effectively playing‘ upon
the ever present anti-American feeling in Latin

The First Steps

 

America to maintain the revolutionary zeal neces-
sary for the continuance of his regime.

United States foreign policy toward Cuba,‘in
these times, has been relatively simple, limiting
itself to notes of condemnation, patiently waiting

for Castro to fall victim to his own excesses, .and
maintaining two psychological trump cards, the U.
S. Embassy in Havana and the naval base at Guan-
tanamo Bay. They both have been valuable to the
United States in that they, among other things,
stood as graphic evidences that the United States,
while not interfering with Cuban internal affairs,
would not ,withdraw its rightful interests from
Cuba.

Attack Launched .

Recently, Castro made his first direct attack
upon the embassy by demanding that its staff be
cut from over 300 to less than 11 workers. This
was truly an insult to the United States, but when
President Eisenhower succumbed and called back
our diplomats he dealt our assets :9. severe blow.
The United States not- only lost an ofﬁcial link with

Cuba, it lost one of its psychological weapons and,

seriously endangered the other. For with the em-
bassy gone, the naval base is no longer, in the eyes
of Latin America, clothed with even a facsimile of
legality. ‘

It -will be quite easy now for Castro to seriously
damage what is left of American prestige simply
by pressing the United States at Guantanamo. And
as soon as we attempt to defend the base, we will
become agressors. With Communism knocking at
the door of Latin America, the consequences_of this
position for the United States are obvious. We
should never’ have broken oﬁicial ties with Cuba.

The Very Freshmen _

By Matthew Nesvisky

It's that time again.

Once» again our hallowed halls echo the pitiful
patter of tiny lost feet. Once again our elevators
contain bobbing seas of inquiring, well-scrubbed
faces. Once again our eateries '
are packed. with toe-tromping
tray — balancing, money-groping-,
seat-searching organisms.

The new Freshmen have_ ar-
rived. And with them once again
has come our duty, as upper-
classmen, to welcome these
shaky little sheep; to seek them
out and help build them into
stalwart champions of Pitt. For-' 
tunately, it is not difficult to ﬁnd
these needy victims of the Inqui-
sitionof Adaption.

Just 77Two Kinds‘ .

Contrary to popular belief, Freshmen come in
two classiﬁcations: male and female (just like most
upperclassmen). In addition, the new recruits ar-
rive at Pitt in at least one of the following psycho-
logical states: (A) neurotic; (B)- catatonic; or (C)
chicken. _

The average Freshman weighs approximately
102 pounds (Centigrade)’and is about four and "a
hal.f feet (Troy scale) in length.

The male of the species is easily located. He is
usually seen with his back against the wall of
some well-populated corridor in the Cathedral. He

 

wears a Jack Kennedyhaircut and appears to be
carrying a weight of responsibility on his shoulders
equal to that of the President-elect.- His left hand,
adorned with a four carat Finkelbriar High School
ring, clutches a crumpled Student Invoice in its

sweaty palm. The Freshman is wary of all
strangers, whom he considers terrible Torque-
madas, and is known to bite when provoked.
Bob-tailed Beauties

The female Freshmanette is a more active crea-
ture. She usually can be observed dashing either
to or from the Ladies’ Room. This charming
freckle-face is always attired in the unofﬁcial uni-
form of her class: patent-leather shoes with silver
buckles, pink Alice-in-Wonderland stockings, a
periwinkle blue frock with a tiny lace apron for
cookies, and white kid gloves.

As she travels about campus, burdened with
more books than a billionaire bibliomaniac, little
Miss Freshie hides many questions behind her
oblique smile: “How in the world will I ever get
into Eata Pizza Pi Sorority? Are my pigtails, really

out of place at Pitt? What the heck is" Political.

Science, anyway?” A

As any compassionate upperclassman can see,
these struggling newcomers need help. Until we
get every new boy a pair of loafers and a beer-
stein and every new girl’ a sprayed-on sweater and
a pack of Viceroys, our job is not_ complete.

So let not one of us tarry —— there is work to
be done.

“Comp|acency"
 Charged to Cats’
 Teams, Coaches

. ,5; By JACK SMITH
‘ Executive Sports Editor

  
 
 

You can charge the loss of ﬁve foot.ball players through grade
failure and this year’s 4-3-3 record of the Panther football team to
one thing. “complacency.” This complacency does not only apply to
the Panther coaching staff but more important to the players them-
selves.

This complacency, as I call it, stems from before the season
started. It is relative to other words like ability, training, condi-
tioning and, perhaps most important, emotion. Prior to the season,

football writers and coaches" said the Panthers had many players _

with ability. If this were so then the next logical step‘ would have
been the training of that material which includes the learning of
plays.

Many football players claim long practice sessions, and skull ses-
sions, in which players learn plays, gcounterplays, -signals, counter-
signals, automatic signals, leave little time to keep pace with the
acceleration of Pitt’s academic program.

Then too, once the season is over many players spend
weeks traveling the banquet circuit. I really'can’t blame them
for that, for who doesn’t like a good meal, a pat on the back, and
a ﬂowery word thrown ‘at his feet. Nevertheless, this too con-
sumes a player’s study time.

Yet, I don’t feel the real problem lies in either one of these
“excuses.” Maybe the game of football has become too technical.
Maybe this play, counterplay business is causing coaches and play-
ers to forget the basic game of football that primarily involves abil-
ity, training and the emotion that makes a -player put that little
something extra into his practice and play. i

A technical point cost Pitt.the Oklahoma game last year. When
quarterback.Jim Traﬁcant called his play in the huddle for a two
point conversion, he could have -walked over for thewscore had the
play been completed. ~

Traﬁcant, however, tried to change the play at the line of
scrimmage. Not all the players heard the change, Traﬁcant
failed to score and the Panthers lost. Maybe the players are
having enough trouble learning basic plays without ﬁlling their
heads with technical points most players never learn anyway.

Then there is conditioning. At one time Pitt teams were con-
sidered to be the best conditioned teams in the nation. I don’t be-
lieve this is any longer so. And, if the excuses for losing games is
a lack of depth, then Pitt should start playing teams of a lower
caliber.

Then there is emotion. Emotionally a player has to want to ex-
cel, to get in condition, to discipline his life both physically and
mentally. The ones that are willing to make the physical sacriﬁces
of conditioning and training, excel; the ones, that don’t never reach
their potential. The ones that don’t make the mental sacriﬁces of
learning plays and studying aren’t successful, or are dropped from
school like ﬁve football players were this year.

Although not officially a grade problem, everyone who was
friendly with quarterback Ed Sharockman knew before the
season ended he wouldn’t return. There was varsity tackle Bob
Budavich, and perhaps the most outstanding young tackles
coming up, Bob Zvolerin, Chuck Adonizio, Dick Taylor and full-
back Mike Frasca.

Each wasigiven a chance to stay in school despite poor grades
the trimester before. Most of these men were not willing to make

‘the sacriﬁce in studying. Yet, several were not able to keep pace

with Pitt’s high academic standards.

The frightening thing is that this complacency is spreading
through the entire Pitt athletic program. It’s about time that coaches
and players alike wake up to the fact that there is a spiritual side
to sports. Only when Pitt rids itself of this complacent attitude will
the University produce great teams, and men.

Four W/restlers Also Risk Perfect Records
By TED COLTON

If Brooks Compliment can get by the Pitt Eligibility
Committee this week then Rex Peery’s matmen will have
no trouble disposing of Syracuse on Saturday.

Compliment is Peery’s 19l—pound problem child wres-
tler. It seems that Compliment keeps having trouble with
his grades everytime he is needed by the matmen. Every-

until it was discovered that he
had only passed 231/2 credits dur-
ing the last two trimesters.

The University requires ath-
letes to pass 24 credits in order
to participate in sports. However,
there have been some athletes,
All-American Mike Ditka for one,
who have only passed 23 credits
and still have been ruled eligible.

Special Ruling

It takes a special ruling by
the Athletic Committee to enable
an athlete to particpate. Peery
said, “I’ve explained to the com-
mittee how the boy will beneﬁt
both physically and mentally if he
is allowed to play. I do hope he
is ruled eligible.”

As for the rest of the team
the picture is a little brighter.
The first ﬁve wrestlers, Dick
Martin, Larry Lauchle, Daryl
Kelvington, John Zolikoff and
Jim Harrison, will move back
down to their usual weight class.

Augie Arrigone will ﬁll in the
167 pound division and Chuck
Shaffer will move down to 177.
This will leave Compliment, if he
is eligible, for the 191 pound berth,
and Battling Bob Guzik for the
heavyweight class.

Four Win Streaks .

Four of the Panthers will be
carrying dual meeting win streaks
into the Syracuse match. Lauchle
has the longest with 20 straight
dual meet victories. Martin and
Kelvington have identical 10-0
records with Zolikoff posting a

cuse last year 2.5-5. It was in

Indoor Track Season Opens With
Panthers Traveling To Annapolis

Coach Carl Rees’ track team
will open the indoor season Sat-
urday when they travel to An-
napolis to meet Navy. The Blue
and Gold have scheduled only two
dual meets on the boards, and
both are with the service schools.

The Panthers appear strong in
two events, the mile and two mile
relays.‘ Vance Carter, Harry
Stokes, Bill Hinchberger and Reed
Clarke will carry the baton in
both events for the Cats.

Stokes and Carter, both sopho-
mores, have identical times of
47.2 in the 440 and Stokes, who is
considered the best half miler
since Arnie Sowell, has run the

880 in l:5l.2.

Hinchberger has run the half
mile in l:52.8 while Clarke ran
a 1:53.8. In the ﬁeld events
Rees has Dan Kanell and Dick
Clark in the weights and Ed
Vamos and Roy Moﬁitt in the
broad and high jump. Ron
Weires will take care of the pole
vaulting for the Cats.

Besides the two dual meets the
Panther track team will perform
at the Junior and Senior AAU
meets at South Park and the
IC4A meet in New York plus
some indoor invitation meets, de-
pending on how they perform
against Navy and Army.

Ihe Juiciesl and Most Iemplingllol Dogs in Town

 

By LARRY HAG-GERTY

With only four lettermen

returning, the Panther gym-
nastics team embarks on a
rugged seven—meet schedule
on Saturday afternoon when
they encounter Chet Phillips’

Navy squad. The meet gets un-
derway at 2 o’clock in the Field
House. .

Last year’s top scorers, Dave
Hirst and Don Kasner have grad-
uated, leaving Earl McConnell,
Joe Battaglia, Ron Daugherty and

Jack Rainaldi to carry on in their '

footsteps. In 1960 the Jungle Cats
ﬁnished with a 5-3 record which
was an improvement over the pre-
vious year’s 3-3 chart. 3 ‘

clash .with Navy will be the
tumbling dual between last sea-
son’s Eastern champion, the Mid-
dies’-Joe Marshall, and the Pan-
thers’ McConnell who lost the
EIGL title to Marshall by the mar-
gin of 1/é point.

Most of us felt that McConnell
received a bad deal in his loss
to Marshall,” replied Battaglia
after a recent practice session.
Battaglia and sophomore Bob
Pingatore will join McConnell
in comprising the Panthers’
trio of tumblers.

On the diﬁicult side horse event
Navy sends three veterans, Bruce
Krueger, Jerome Larsen and Joe
Maiden, against the Jungle Cats’
Daugherty, and sophomdres Ed

ﬁgures to win the high bar for the
Panthers with help being provided
by Zamecnik. Krueger is Navy’s
main hope in this event.

The parallel bars should end
111. almost even with the Blue
and Gold’s Rainaldi, McConnell,
and either Pingatore or Zamec-
nik being. pitted against Navy’s

_ Krueger, Jim, Koch and Cecil
Tune. _ . 4 _

Flying rings, always a_ Jungle‘
Cat stronghold, should be hotly
contested between Battaglia and
the Sai1or’s Jim Sloat and Van
Carlton ,Temple. Joining Battaglia
for the locale will be sophomore
John Patterson and either John

Grady-93 Teams Coaches Find Something in Common

"Hold Jinx Over Pope, Summers Handle Squash

Next Opponent

Cat Mermen Hope

Luck Continues In

Lehigh Encounter

Will the Aquatic Cats be
able to hold their spell over
the tankers from Lehigh?
This is the question Coach
Ben Grady is asking as he
prepares his Merman for the

next meet at Lehigh, Saturday.
The Panthers and the Brown

and White have met in the pool England in the 1380’S-

seven times and seven times the
Panther tankers have defeated Le-
high. Last year _
the, Mermen  
eaked out a 52-
43 triumph at
the Tech pool.

Jeff Scholz,
ace
sprinter, is ex-
pected to give
the Panthers’
Bart Haas a
tough battle for
the short dis- *
tance honors. Grady
On the other hand, Jerry Solling-
er, the Panthers’ 200-yard spec-
ialist, is expected to cop ﬁrst
place in his event.

Lehigh’s 400,-yard relay team
of Dave Thorne, Paul Abram-
son, John DeBarbadillo, and
Jeff Scholz recently set a new
record at Lehigh and should be
a tough race for the Aquatic
Cats.

Coach Bill Christian of the Le-
high swimmers said, “This team
will get better as it goes along,
and in Scholz and DeBarbadillo
we have two of the most promis-
ing sophomores in the area.

After a close loss to North
Carolina State, the Panther Mer-
men will be seeking revenge. "Al-
though Lehigh has a strong squad,
Coach Grady feels conﬁdent that
the tankers will hold their jinx
over Lehigh.

The visitors will be without

tional sports writers think enough
of the Titans to rank them tenth

ﬁves. P

“Westminster has been em-
-ploying man-to-man defense,”
Timmonssaid, “so Jinks won’t
be free to shoot as often.” He
grinned with that remark, then
recalled how easily the high-
scoring sophomore shakes loose

 

to exploit his jump shooting
ability.
“They’ll be tough,” he con-

tinued, “but if Steinhart plays
like he did against Syracuse, and
the other starters retain their
momentum, we can beat them.

Two city rivals will meet in
the preliminary contest at 7:30..
Duquesne and Carnegie Tech
tangle for their second time this
season. Duquesne won the ﬁrst
battle.‘

The Pirates; sparked by former
Panther "All-American Charley
Hyatt who is 56 years old, will
engage  the Steeler gridders on
the hardcourt. The Rooneymen
have added recent’ Al1—American
Don Hennon to their roster. They
will meet between the other two
games. {'7. _.

. By JIl\'I 0’BRIEN .
On the second floor of the Field House‘, behind the stu-
dent bleacher section, eight cell-like rooms are located, four

courts and their inhabitants

two seriously interested gen-

tlemen survey their every movement. The overseers are Ben

Pope and Bill Summers, noté
wardens or guards, but the squash
coaches of the University.

The resemblance of the sur-
roundings to a prison isn’t merely
coincidential, for according to
some historians; the game origin-
ated in the debtor’s prison in

Little Resemblance
There is little resemblance be-
tween the appearances of th e
Panther coaches, but both are well
schooled in the art of squash.
Head Coach Ben Pope is the elder
statesman at 57, but the lumber-
ing gargantuan ﬁgure of 6’—3” and
257 pounds is still a menacing
ﬁgure, battling at close quarters
in the confines of a court.

Pope’s younger assistant, Bill
Summers, 29, is smaller in
stature at 5'10” and 172, but he
too is an odroit racquet yielder.
The Springﬁeld College grad has

COGA'RETTE'S

 

been on the athletic roster for
four years.

Pope received his sheepskin at
Eastern District High in Brook-
lyn, and he has been coach for
six years since succeeding Jim
Tully who assumed a job at the
Marion Cricket Club.

Top-Flight Player

Pope was a top—flight. player
in the late ’20’s and the early
’30’s. Though he competed in the
ﬁnals of the pro championship
and also the ﬁnals of the Metro-
politan Invitational Open in New
York, he was second-best both
times. Oddly enough, his con-
queror was a diminutive 5 feet,
6 inches tall, and at 145 pounds
would just qualify for the light-
weight division in boxing -— Wil-
liam B. Summers, Sr., his assist-
ant’s father.

League To Start

The intramural basketball

and slashed Pope across the
check with his racquet.

The crash of ’29 which occurred
that year couldn’t have upstaged
this crushing blow. Pope grew
gun shy and Summer's clad be-
came another David who slew a
Goliath.

Assistant Coach Summers in-
herits a lot of his Dad's savvy
and ﬁery play, but Ben is hop-
ing that when they engage in
some friendly matches that he

doesn’t resort to any of his fa-
ther’s battle tactics.

HOW TO

WIN A MASTER’SiDEGREE

AFTER 10.YEARS AS A FRESHMAN

 

They've been enrolled at Capitol for 10 years now and
still haven’t become the Four Sophomores, but the

Four Freshmen’s just—released album displays a degree of musical
mastery that’s just about the smoothest and most danceable this
side of Commencement Day. In the style of the original “Freshmen
Sound,” the boys sing and play their own backings to songs like
Funny Valenﬂne, Paper Moon, But Beautiful and Dream. Strictly

straight-A stuff.
