“At a time when the air

all, it is appropriate that we
lighten the atmosphere with a
discussion of the parity raids of

Pitt Chest Campaign

Female Footballers To Provide

Charity

Funds As Well As Laughs ’

The Powderpuff football game between McCormick and

Holland Halls will be played as a beneﬁt game for the Pitt '

Chest campaign which will take place November 12 to l6.
The game will cost 25 cents per person, according‘ to Dan

Johnson, publicity director.

In addition" to the general

Give in Thanks,” the slogan “The
Heart of Pitt is in the Pitt Chest”
will be used during the week long
fund drive. ' I

Solicitors for the Pitt Chest will
approach organizations all next
week and ask their members to
either /give a‘ donation or pledge
one. Pledge cards will be distri-
buted to everyone and pledges
may be paid in monthly install-
ments or at the end of the term,
Johnson announced.

Brochures Available

Brochures telling about the
campaign ‘will be available No-
vember 12, near the SU and

Cathedral desks. In addition to

explaining the drive,’ the brochure
will contain a pledge card for stu-
dents to ﬁll out.

“This is "actually the Pitt
United '-Fund,” Johnson stated.
“It is a chance for the students
to give once and help all or-
ganizations, both on campus and
off campus.” _

The organizations which will
receive money from r the ‘Pitt
Chest campaign are ‘the United
Fund of Allegheny C 0 u n t y,
World University Service, Negro
Scholarship Fund, Men’s Loan
Fund, and Women’s Loan Fund.

Homecoming Success

Despite Weak Spots

The 1962 Homecoming week-
end was “relatively successful,”

according to Student Government
president Tom Olofson. “The an-
nual Saturday evening affair was
veryiwell supported, but the ad-
ditional program at the Vogue
Terrace was not what they ex-
pected even with the second show
a sell-out.”

144 people attended the ﬁrst
show at the Vog_ue Terrace Friday
night. Under ten tickets were sold
at the door, according to Olofson.
“This was the social event that
made it a weekend affair. We
were disappointed at the attend-
ance because we anticipated a
greater response.”

The second show, however, was
a sell-out. 750 people ﬁlled the
Vogue Terrace to capacity. People
were standing and a special annex
was opened to seat the extra
guests, according to Olofson.

Supported Second

“Sororities and fraternities
mainly supported the second
show. For some reason the ﬁrst
show was not so popular,” Olof-
son commented. “The second show
still did not make up for the poor
attendance at the ﬁrst. The total
attendance" was below expecta-

   
  
  

475 extra tickets were sold at
the door to the dance. This plus
the 452 weekend, tickets sold
brought about 1844 people to
the Saturday night event. “We
were , extremely pleased _ with
the additional ticket sale,”
Olofson said. “This is more than
we had anticipated. Compared
with the totalattendance at the
I‘ Vogue Terrace, the results even-
ed themselves out."

The Huntsmen, who performed
in the Tuck Shop during band
breaks, “were excellent according
to the comments I received,”
Olofson declared.

Phi Gamma. Delta and Alpha
Delta Pi took ﬁrst place in the
float contest with their Raid com-

and Phi Sigma Sigma combined
on the pepsodent advertisement to
take second place. Tied for third
place were Delta Tau Delta and

Debates Cuba

By NANCY FUCHS
Two student speakers ex-

pressed divergent American .
and Latin American views in

a discussion on “Cuba and
American Foreign Policy in

Latin America” held ‘by the‘

International Relations Club last
Sunday evening. U

Nathan Firestone, a student in
the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, said
that we must

did the least he could have done.”

He felt that the Cuban situa-
tion has changed radically in the
light of recent development. The
issue is no longer just between
the United States and Cuba. “By
accepting Russian ‘missiles, Cas-
tro has made Cuba an issue in-
the Cold'War.”

Fears Repercussions
Pedro Lintner, a student from

Chile, expressed his fear that any-
toward»

further -agressive steps
Cuba, such as an invasion, for
which American sentiment is
strong, would result in “bad re-.
percussions in the future."

He warned that the United C

States does not have the full
support of
against Cuba. There have been
demonstrations and bombings
of American embassies in Boli-
via, Peru, Chile, and Argentina
within the past two weeks,’ and
the Brazilian Longshoreman
Union declared an embargo on
American goods 1 during our
blockade of Cub a, Lintner
‘noted.
_In t h e
thoughts turned from the immedi-
ate crisis to Castrosim as a cause

of future revolutions. The con- .

sensus was that reform is inevi-
table, but only a moderate revo-
lution will be in “the best inter-
est of ,’Latin Americans and of

According to Lintner, “no de-

Linguist Lectures Lucidly

By JO NELSON‘,
‘ “American is" the most
widely spoken dialect of the
English language.” said Dr.

Stephen Foster M e m_o r i a 1
Monday night. Two-thirds of
the English speaking peoples or
about 200 million people speak
this dialect today. _

Dr. Pei, visiting Andrew Mellon
Professor of Modern’Languages, is
a professor of Romance Philology
at Columbia University. , ,

Pei is the speaker for part of
the 1962 series of Andrew Mellon
Professor Lecturesof the Univer-
sity. In six lectures he will speak
on linquistic forms of the modern
world, —

_ Was at Bottom

Between 1100 and 1800, English
ranked at the bottom of the list
of widely spoken languages, he
said. In the 1900’s there was a
great increase in the growth of
English due to the spread of its
representatives on American soil.

During the mid 18th century
a differentiation began to take
place between "the languages
spoken in England and Amer-
ica. This process took 100 years
to complete. However, since the
dawn of the 20th century the
differences have begun to di-
minish. The languages are again
merging, Dr. Pei noted.

British, South Africans, New

Zealanders, and Austrailians speak

the original British dialect, while
the Americans and Canadians
represent the American segment.

Stem from Original

Many of the American dialects
and differences stem from original
English usages. In America there
are twelve main dialectal divis-
ions. Dr. Pei said that the Lin-
quistic Atlas lists these and other
linguistic differences.

There is general cleavage in
America which divides the
country into three main dialec-
tical sections; Eastern, Southern
and Midwestern. It is said that
a person can be placed in the
correct section by a certain
quirk of vocabulary. Easterners
say bag; Southerners, poke; and
Midwesterners, sack.

 _ Marshall Masterminds Math J  

 

Sessions ‘To Help Everybody’

Courses Given
By 6 Tutors

- By JACKI KATZ
To many students, mathe-
matics is one of these courses
that is taken only because it
is required. It is often heard,

~ “I wish I didn’t have to take

math, but it’s required for
my major.” Dick Marshall does

A not feel this way at all. ‘A senior

math major, he organized the

!’___4f .=,/Math Sessions during the [first

term of his sophomore year.
Although Marshall had some
good objectives for‘ starting the
sessions, his main reason was be-
cause, “Everyone"kept coming to
me for math help, so‘ I decided
to try to help everybody at once.”
His other purposes for starting
the sesions were: “to Offer an

opportunity for discussion. of the.
, topics currently under study, to
I w/ork out randediscuss troublesome

homework problems; and in gen-
eral to act as a supplement tothe
regular math classes.
Questions Easier
“Many students ﬁnd. it easier to
ask questions of another Student
than they do of an instructor,”
Marshall stated. “They also en-
able the student to ask questions
he was unable to ask during class.
Marshall started the sessions
on a trial basis in September
1960. At that time he only of-
fered Math 21 and he was the
only student instructor. 15 stu-
dents attended the ﬁrst meeting
which was held in the Student
Union. I
Since that time Marshall has
constantly been expanding and
improving the sessions. ‘ Another
session was added each term so
that there are now five courses
offered. To accommodate the
larger attendance the Sessions are
now held in the Cathedral, Clapp
Hall, or the Logan Armory.
Six Tutor
Six students now tutor the
courses which include Math 21,
22, 23, 24., and-110, Most of the
courses are offered in the even-
ings. . ‘
“I scheduled the sessions at
night because I heard com-
plaints that students could not
attend the Phi Eta Sigma class-
es because they were held dur-
ing the day and too many stu-
dents had classes at that time,”
explained Marshall.“‘I felt that
if the sessions wer at night
more people could come before
they started their homework.”
According to Marshall, the tut-

MATHEMATICIAN MARSHALL

orer has to be prepared to,an-
swer any type of question. “In-

varibly“s_omeone will ask the one‘
question I do not know the an-'

swer to, or else they will ask
about something not pertaining'to'
the subject under discussion."
Cited Incident

As an example he cited an inci-

dent that “happened when. his

group was calmly discussing trig-

onometric functions. A “Someone
asked the question, which are
there more of, natural numbers
or odd numbers ,and I explained

it to him. This question had ab-
solutely nothing to do with trigo-
nometric functions, ‘but instead
had to,do with cardinal numbers
of inﬁnite sets which the student
had not even studied.”
These sessions‘ are_ also giv-
ing Marshall practice for his
future profession. Following
graduation he hopes to attend
graduate school and study for
a doctorate. He also hopes to
teach mathematics in college.
Marshall also receives a “sense
of satisfaction that someone is
gettingthe help he needs. I also
enjoy a sense of—achievement at
being able to help people,” he
continued. _- _’ ,

Letters to the Editor

A Counter- Picket
iDefends Position

Editor, The Pitt News

counter-pickets
join you and those who abhor
the attempted denial of the right

to picket through the use of vio-

lence. Therefore, let the record

qbe set straight for we did not

support or encourage the dis-
graceful attack made _of the pac-

"iﬁsts.

Let it_also be known that we
were not there for the speciﬁc
purpose of letting off steam by

“‘mixing it up” with these dem-

instrators. Believe it or not, our
minds and hearts were in fa-
vor of destroying the much-dis-
cussed missle bases and there-

fore we counter-picketed in this

light. It may also be pointed out
that by and large those who sit
back. and unintelligently criti-

' cize such participation, lack the

courage of their expressed con-

. victions.

In any event, we support those
who encourage sincere b ut
peaceful demonstrations

Student t Attacks

Construction Emphasis
Editor, The Pitt News
Appalling would be an under-
statement. A distinguished mem-
ber of the faculty of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh must com-
bat the labor force of repara-

tion in the Lilly Court. Reverb-

erations of jackhammers take

. _ preference over King Lear.

Private toilets are installed
for administration ofli
cials, lawns are rejuvenated.

Distinguished professors are ap-,

parently considered as expen-
dable. They are here for the
students and for the ultimate
purpose of expressing the values
and the relevancies of educa-
tion for the advancement of peo-
ple. '

Apparently the man who is
devoted to a study of Shake-
speare has the purpose in this
institution of bending and suc-
cumbing.to the particular work
project at hand. Few seem in-
terested in what a man has to
contribute to the development of
understanding in the human
mind.

Rather the emphasis here is
obviously focused on the height
of cylindrical buildings and the
power of money

Possibly the status will be at-
tained and the people who ven-
ture here will be impressed. The
incidents will pass and the an-
ger will subside with time.

Of equal, if not greater im-'

portance is the more obvious
problem of the student. In this
particular instance the overall
reaction of the student to the
disturbance was largely that of

amusement. They did not ex-
press, ‘for the most part, the
slightest connection with the

lack of respect which they were
showing and the way in which
they generally‘ behave.
Occupying time with irrele-
vant subjects is a major con-
cern here. Although these irrele-
vancies do not indicate the feel-
ings and actions of the student

- body as a whole, they do unfor-

tunately reveal that the environ-
ment here is conducive to rau-
cous attitudes and the release of
these attitudes. ‘

As a result it seemsvnatural
that this person will find an in-
sulting situation humorous. Also
this unconcerned individual is,
so to speak, a probable candi-
date‘ for alliance with move-
ments which are incongruent
with the educational purpose of
a university. '

One ‘day The University of’

Pittsburgh will be a -place where
architects stand amazed, a place
where alcoholic beverages are
dispensed at a fee, a place where
scholars seldom venture, and a
place where respect has van-
ished.

The Failing Image

In a set of offices on the sixth floor of Bruce
Hall a small but efficient group of aspiring public
relations people work long and hard each day of
the week in an attempt to present this University
to the general public as an insti- -
tution of higherylearning worthy-
of the name —— an institution
where doting parents can send
their offspring with the conﬁ-
dence that they will receive the
best in instruction that America
can offer — an institution which
is going places in social and ath-
letic as well as academic circles
— an institution that will make
of them law abiding and useful
citizens of a growing America. _

Unfortunately a self-appointed student public
relations committee is doing everything in its power
to present this University as a pro"-communist, pro-
fascist, anti-religious, institution founded upon the

basic principles of intolerence and anarchy, and '

whose two most popular classes are in alcoholism
and street ﬁghting.

Such is the Pitt image as broadcast in banner

headlines on the front pages of the downtown
newspapers, and such is the image which our own
students have so vividly placed in the minds of all
parents who live within" reach of the Pittsburgh
papers. . ' _ ’

In some cases such as the anti-picketing ﬁasco
at the time of the Cuban crisis, this corrupt image

has even had nationwide coverage and it ought to

be of little surprise to no one if Pit_t.’s enrollment
continues to decrease in lieu of the unhealthy pub-

licity which the students have brought upon their

Univrsity.

Pitt Heqd-Lock

No parnts will want their children thrust, at‘ a

still impressionable age, into the clutches of an in-
stitution which displays through the actions of its
students a complete disregard for lawiand order,
for the welfare of/its neighbors, for the safety of
its country in time of crisis, and even a disregard
for the student's own self—respect. I '

How can one expect a parent to send his child to
Pitt in order to learn how to get- along with people
in the outside world when brothers in the ‘same fra-
ternity system square off with each other at a
football game like common street thugs.

Of course, the students defend their infantile
actions by quoting the Bill of Rights and other
documents defending theiindividuals right of free

' speech, protest, and protection of property. But is

free speech the only thing at stake when a group

of students from a “special ﬂoor” vote to invite a

man to speak whoadvocates the extermination of

ten million Americans?‘ Or is the ‘right to protest
' O

 

so very important when those who are protesting
are doing so against a policy of the Federal Gov-

ernment which if not carried out, could mean the
eventual end of the United States as a free country?

What again is the purpose in starting a brawl at
a public sports event requiring the intervention of

some dozen policemen to quell the rioters when all J

the “property” at stake is a “paper-mache sweet-
heart of Sigma Chi?”, The same sort of worthless
defense of one’s rights is evident in a fraternity’s
refusal to stop singing when asked’by a next door
neighbor, or in,«the slugging of a cop by a football
player who was asked to control his conduct.
When students are motivated by their emotions,

-which seems to be the case in all the incidents

which made the Pittsburgh papers, instead of by

their minds, the result is usually disastrous to the, .(«-

reputation of the University, and this, to ‘a school*
which is desperately struggling to build-a once un-
distinguished reputation into one of higher stand-'
ing, is a problem of much concern.

The Crusaders

If the issues involved in. the above-mentioned

incidents were of signiﬁcant importance then one

might tend to forget the University reputation in
favor of some higher ideal, but, Pitt students seem
to have a tendency to overlook the purpose .for

which they are crusading and concentrate too much :3,-

on‘_the crusading itself. ' . . . .
. This crusading "may take the form of a protest
picket, a controv_ersial speaker, the defending of a
fraternity symbol, or the right to sing'in one’s back
yard. In all cases, however, the cause was worth-
less_ but the harm done by the crusading next to
disastrous. ’

What, then can be done to prevent the recur-
rence of such’ repugnant behavior? The natural
course of action would seem to be the reliance by
the University on the common sense of the students

' once they are aware of the disfavorable repercus‘-‘"7

sions. of'their actions to take more care in the
future. ’ , ‘ '

However, this is expecting much too much. of
the Pitt student body. The individuals and groups
involved, have never used common sense when it

’ comes to any emotional problem and it is doubtful

whether, in the future, theycan be expected to
behave in any manner so alien to their personalities.

, The ohly hope seems to be that as the Uni-. 1*
versity grows in stature so will the student body
' and these reactionary and rowdy elements will pass

out of the school forever. However," if any more
harm is done to the University reputation by such
regressive behavior, Pitt may ﬁnd itself drawing
more of the same type of individuals and its repu-

' tation damaged so permanently that it may never

be repaired-

Organizational _ Drinking . . :’

Alcohol Advantage »_

r

The Student Government alcohol proposal, while
reflecting a growing maturity on campus, seems to

hand the advantage of on-campus drinking to fra-

ternities and recognized organizations, while deny-
ing dorm students the same
advantage. ‘ ' I

Fraternities, especially, 
they can serve alcoholic bever
ages during rush periods, will
beneﬁt. Freshmen, who make up
most of the fraternity rushees,
bewildered and bedraggled dur-
ing his ﬁrst week by all night
bull sessions and adjustments to
typically eﬂicient University pro-
cedure will be" exposed to “fra-
ternity rush,” and, if the SG pro— .
posal is approved, the various forms of “demon
rum.”

 

An immature, easily inﬂuenced rushee, could ig-
nore weighing the advantages and disadvantages of
the fraternitysystem and, in an alcoholic haze,
pledge the fraternity that offers him the best time
— complete with free liquor.

Legal drinking in fraternity houses
strengthen the system by keepingfraternity parties
at the house and by easing the ﬁnancial strain
caused by- “off-campus” ‘parties. ' _ .

Yet, if abused, ,imm_ature drinking practices
could adversely inﬂu

would A

ence ‘many students, including

      
 

—By Frank Conchar

Recognized student organizationscan apply to

SG for approval to serve alcoholic beverages during _«

social functions. Undoubtedly, the regulations will
be strictly adhered to at ﬁrst. But will the organi-
zations xfollow SG rules after- the first alcoholic
ﬂush has worn off? I
Difficult ‘Enforcement

.How will the enforcement of the age limit for
student drinking be followed by asking students ‘to
present proof of age at parties of their own organi-
zations? It will be difficult to- ask the 220-lb. brute
drinking his sixth bottle of beer for a draft card.

Probably the question of age restrictions will
be allowed to slide until students will drink at
University functions without questions of age.

The SG proposal states that students can be
educated in the proper use of alcoholic beverages,

but doesn’t permit drinking in the dorms. People '

can be just as educated drinking inthe dorms as
at fraternity or organization functions. ‘If they

fail their first lesson in drinking, cold showers and-

bed are close by. A

If the SG proposal is approved, students active
in campus life can tip their glasses in the luxurious
lounges and rooms of the SU or in fraternity

houses, while their non-active brethren, who com- ‘V
_ pose the vast majority,of the studentbody, must

Under the direction of the ‘

Student Union Board, the

. Union has become the seat of the
"”major_ portion of social, recrea-

ing progr_ams.- These include the
v Midday Series, PM Series, Film
I Series, Forum Series, Weekend.
 Programs and Dances, and Spe-
E cial Events.

' The Student Union Board ex-

College Study
Mulls Problem
Of ‘Lefties’

A recent survey around the
country shows that the number of
“lefties” in the world is steadily
increasing. Already 10 per cent of
the world population falls under
this class as compared to just
three per cent 25 years ago. If the
present trend continues a day may
come when the “rightist” may be
in minority.

Fearing this, colleges are taking
precautions and making things
difficult for the southpaws. No
special facilities are at present
contemplated by the college auth-
orities for these minority group.

One of the “handicapped” con-
ﬁded that he had turned this “ab-
normality” into a blessing: he
could sit at ‘a table in the library
taking notes with his left hand
and at the same time hold hands
with his girl writing are-port with

’ her right.

Didn't Run

_“I didn’t run into any diﬂ’icul-
ties until I hit this campus. I
wore my watch on my right arm,
little realizing that only engaged
girls do so, until some campus stu-
dent clued me in,” A coed lament-
ed.

“I sometimes drink out of my
neighbor's glass on my left,” an-
other “Lefty” ehorused.

Perhaps the most constructive
piece of advise came from the
student who suggested that who-
ever is in charge of the acquisi-
tion of furniture for the college
have some chairs made for the
lefties‘ and place them in every
classroom._“And it wouldn’t hurt
to have some left-handed pencil
sharpeners and scissors, while
they are at it,” he concluded.

On Europe Study Tour

Kathleen F lanagen
Sees Her Ireland

Many’ students have often
wished that they could spend
one summer vacation in Eur-
ope. For Kathleen Flanagan
this dream came true when
she won the Irish Award last
summer.

“The purpose of this award is
to give a student an opportunity
to study and travel,” Miss Flana-
gan said. “I had a chance to visit
most of the countries of West-
ern Europe.”

The award included a course in
the general survey of Irish Cul-
ture at Trinity College in Dub-
lin, Ireland. The course lasted
for two weeks and experts in

many different fields lectured to
the student body.
Informal Relationship

“We had a very informal stu-
dent-teacher relationship,” she
continued, “however the super-
ﬁcial. aspects were very formal.
The professors wore academic
gowns and each professor was
introduced before the lecture.”
Since this was only a short course,
no tests were given.

During her trip to Europe,
Miss Flanagan visited Germany,
Italy, Holland, Belgium, Eng‘-
land, Austria, Switzerland,‘ and
France. “This was an experi-
ence by which one couldn’t help-
proﬁtting,” she said. “I don’t
think I will really realize the
true value of this experience
for many years.” ,

In comparing Ireland with the
United States, she explained that
most of Ireland is rural, with only
one really large city, Dublin. “One
can’t get a very good impression
of Ireland if he only visits Dub-
lin. I was fortunate enough to be
invited to homes in the smaller
towns.”

“Throughout Europe the people
treated American _travelers very
favorably and were always pleas-
ed if we could speak a few words
in their language.”

STAFF MEETING

A meeting for all Pitt News
reporters has been scheduled
for tomorrow at noon in the
news_ office. All reporters must
attend.

OCEE and State Dept.

Host to Costa Ricans

The University Office of Cultural and Educational Ex-

change, and the United States

Department of State are act-

ing as hosts to 17 students and three professors from the
faculty of engineering of the University of Costa Rica here

this week.

The group arrived in Pittsburgh last Thursday and were

taken on a tour of Engineering‘:
Hall Friday. Friday afternoon a
session entitled “The American
Election” was led by Mrs. James
Langer, chairman of voters serv-
ice of the League of Women
Voters.

According to‘Wynfred Joshua,
coordinator of the seminars, the
first question the guests wanted to
know was, “Why isn’t there a
third political party of importance
in the U.S.?” The voting machines
were also demonstrated. Follow-
ing the session the visitors were
taken downtown to see.the actual
voting machines.

_ Guests Toured

On Saturday the guests were
taken on a tour of Pittsburgh and
were guests of Pittsburgh families
for dinner. In the afternoon they
attended the Pitt-Syracuse foot-
ball game. “They consider the
game the most interesting aspect
of their visit,” Miss Joshua said.

The Pittsburgh Steel Com-
pany was host to the Costa
Ricans all day Monday. They
were taken on tours of two dif-
ferent plants and were guests
at a luncheon given in their
honor.

A second seminar session was
held yesterday on the topic “The
Image of the United States
Abroad.” The seminar was led by
Dr. Irwin J. Schulman, professor
of political science.

Last night the visitors were
dinner guests at Pittsburgh homes.
where they also watched the elec-
tion returns on television.

Coach Installs
New Offense

F or H oopsters

Coach Bob Timmons has ex-
pressed the thought that this
year’s basketball team could be as
good as the 1957-58 club which
posted an 18-7 record and got a
berth in the NCAA tourney.

“We have the same kind of
balance as that team,” Timmons
said, “with possibly more scoring
punch from more individuals.”
His ﬁnest club was led by All
America Don Hennon and Julius

Pegues. _
Timmons has installed a
“shuffle oﬁense” this season

which is a form of Doc Carlson’s
old continuity pattern. Every-
body is moving on this system
and it utilizes three front men
rather than a center. A -

The coach indicates that the
following will be starters: Brian
Generalovich, Dave Sauer, Cal
Sheffield, Paul Krieger and Tim
Grgurich. The leading subs will
be outside man’ Dave‘Roman, a
transfer from Johnstown College,
and inside ‘man, Ben Jinks.

Jinks and Generalovich have

By FRED MARCUS

Lock Haven is -the next stop for the rampaging Panther
soccer team, and this coming Saturday at 2 p.m. the Panthers
plan to trounce the Bald Eagles in an attempt to wrest the
district NCAA crown out of Rutgers’ reach.

Coach Leo Bemis has commented that “Lock Haven’s

record is not impressive, but

goals.” They scored three againstﬁ

Elizabethtown, a team considered
to be the counterpart and chief
rival of West Chester.

Lock Haven coach George Law-
ther, now in his first year as soc-
cer mentor, says that “the vet-
erans are well trained and highly
talented.” All of the starting posi-
tions except goalie are capable of
being ﬁlled by veterans.

Score of Subs

In addition to the seven sen-
iors and nine juniors, there are
four freshmen and nine sopho-
mores listed on" the roster, so
Lawther may choose to substitute
freely, as other Panther small col-
lege opponents have done.

Co-captain Gary Orwig, Bill
Johnston, and Ed Beaver,‘ all
linemen, will spur the offense
while Dick Bills, a fullback, and

they have been able to score

Ed Journey, at half, are bolster-
ing the Lock Haven defenses.

Meanwhile, Panther injuries
have been dwindling somewhat.
Bob -Murphy spent a few minutes
in the West Chester game, and A1
Fenster and Kent Rentschler have
abandoned their crutches, al-
though they, reportedly, will still
most likely be unable to play for
the remainder of this season.

Against West Chester Satur-
day, Corky Cuthbert lifted his
season total to eleven goals and
his career total to 28. ‘Co-cap-
tain Paul Liberati, who scored
twice in that game, now has
three goals on penalty shots to
his credit.

The entire Panther team, with
two games left, has scored a total
of 30 goals, six above the count at
last season’s conclusion.

Irish Halt Losing
Streak A11d Navy p
In Weekelld Upset

By BOB SMIZIK

A disappointing Notre
Dame team will host the
Panther football team Satur-
day at South Bend, Indiana.
The Irish defeated Navy last
week to break a four game

losing streak after having won
their opener against Oklahoma.

The Notre Dame record, how-
ever,‘ may be misleading. Its four
losses have all come against
strong Bib Ten teams. The Irish
lost to Purdue, 24-6, Wisconsin,
17-8, Michigan State, 31-7 and
Northwestern, 35-6. Their 20-12
win over Navy was an upset.

Since Navy walloped Pitt, 32-9,
it would seem that Notre Dame
rates a big edge over the Panth-
ers.
against the Middies then that will
probably be the case. But the
Panthers also play another type
of ball. That is the type of ball
they played against Baylor,
UCLA and Syracuse.

Hungry Players

The type of ball that has Gene
Sobolewski and Joe Kuzneski
putting unrelenting pressure on
the passer, and that has hungry
linemen like Ernie Borghetti, Bob
Sorochak, Jack Price, Marty
Schottenheimer and Ralph Con-
rad making tackles all over the
ﬁeld.

It will take this type of per-

formance to garner a win
against Notre Dame.
Irish quarterback Daryl La-

monica will give the leaky Panth-
er pass defense plenty of trouble.

' He has—completed better than 50%

of his passes including a 46-yard
touchdown pass to Mt. Lebanon’s
Denny Phillips against‘ Navy.
Lamonica’./1 favorite receiver
is\another Pittsburgh area play— '
er, Jim Kelly of Clairton. He
has nabbed 17 ‘passes for 236
yards. .
Panther defensive backﬁel
coach Carl DePasqua will have to
sharpen up his proteges to stop
Lamonica’s aerials.

CHATHAM STUDENTS proficient
in freshman English work will ‘be
released from class attendance to
work indepepndently at their own"

George Jarmolenko and

George Sommer are the only ones registering goals for the
freshman soccer team, but they’re doing it with pinball

‘according to Coach Bob McNulty,

and possesses a hard, accurate
shot that has recorded nine scores
in four games.

Sommer, an inside right, has
booted the remaining four goals
that the yearlings have scored,
giving them a disproportionate
edge over their foes who have tal-
lied only three times.

Jarmolenko, a native of Zaiten-
dorf, East Germany, came to Phil-
adelphia 12 years» ago. He was an
honor student at Northeast High
School,

He is especially dangerous be-
cause he has a knack for taking
a pass with his back to the en-
em.V goal and score on a pivotal
kick. He was highly recom-
mended to varsity coach Leo
Bemis who gave him scholar-
ship-aid. Sommer, however,
joined the team as a free-lancer.

In contrast with Jarmolenko,
he is quiet and reserved, but
makes his presence known on the
ﬁeld. A resident of Yardly, Pa.,
he attended Lawrenceville,- a
prep school in New Jersey.

He was captain of the soccer
team there and a tennis player on
a team that won the interscho-
lastic two years in a row.

Sommer does not have the
power in his shots that distin-
guish a Jarmolenko blast, but he
does possess good deceptiveness
and accuracy 4- items, along with
power, that Bemis will welcome

in 1963.

NO SPOILS SYSTEM

Mel Lorback, coach of the West Chester College soccer
team, is also the chairman of the NCAA selection commit-
tee for the Pennsylvania-Delaware-New Jersey district.

His Rams are 6-2-1 now, and seek a berth in the NCAA
championship play-offs.‘ Last year they were the’ NCAA
champions. In the other two years that the tournament has
been in existence they were semi-finalists.

They had to rally for a 3-3 tie Saturday against the

 Panther soccer team after being down by three goals.
Coach Leo Bemis of Pitt was hoping .to cinch a berth
for the play-offs with a win here. Instead he got another
tie, which adjusts his team’s record to 6-0-2.

Many of the Panther players are aware of Lorback’s
important position and are getting leery about their chances.
Mafh-Minded ’

Lorback assured us that there is no spoils system in the
soccer selection set-up. He explained that there is a mathe-
matical rating formula known as the Saylor System which

.correlates the records of teams with the strength of their
schedules to determine the choice. -

“Teams used to schedule teams that would be easy
to beat,” Lorback noted. “They were just conscious of
an undefeated season, not quality opponents.” He said
the rules committee made a change to erase that practice
and guarantee competent and worthy winners.

He said it is now possible to get more points by tying or
losing to a team with an “A” rating, than to beat a team in
a lower alphabetical classiﬁcation.

If you tie a team ‘classiﬁed as an “A” team, for example,
you can receive 200 points, whereby if you beat a class

— “D” team, you get 150 points. And by beating a class “B”

team you only are rewarded with 250 points.

A breakdown on the point system -follows:

Class Vtlin Tic Lose
“A” Team 300 200 100
“B” Team ' 250 150 50
“C” Team 200 ‘100 0
“D” Team 150 50 0

Each team is credited with two points for a win, one
point for a tie, and none for a loss. If a team plays ten games
the most points it could possibly accumulate would be
twenty points.

More Facts, Figures .

Then the number of points that are accumulated are di-
vided by the number of points that were possible to accumu-
late. If a team scores above .750 it is an “A” team; from .500
to .750, a “B” team; from .250 to .500, a “C” team; below .250,
a “D” team.

Pitt is presently playing at an .875 clip according to
this system and easily rates as an “A” team. By the same
token West Chester is currently a “B” team with a '.722
rating. 1' «

“Pitt has certainly played a roug'h‘schedule,” Lorback
said. “From what we can see now, Pittsburgh is very-high
in the running for the tournament.” ‘

Two years ago the Panthers caused a pennant-bound
West Chester team to stumble on a 1-1 stalemate, which
could have crippled the Rams’ chances of getting a berth.

Coach Bemis conta.cted the selection committee and
urged them to disregard the tie against Pitt, since his team
had played an inspired game -— probably their best of the
year —— and that West Chester was a far better team. ,

Coach Lorback thanked Bemis for the gesture at that
time, especially since his team received a berth later on.
“I hope I can help you out some time,” Lorback told
Bemis,

Since the new rating system has been invoked Lorback
_won’t get the chance to play the Good Samaritan role. He
lost his chance last Saturday.

Cross-Country Coach Puzzled By 

Losing Season, Questions Reason

By AL BLUMKIN

"‘I wish someone would tell me
what’s wrong with the team,” said
Coach Carl Rees. “I can’t ﬁgure it
out. It has been a bitterly disap-
pointing season, especially since
we opened so well against Slip-
pery Rock.” a

This was the only explanation
offered by Coach Rees as he com-
mented on the poor season that
the harriers will end Saturday.

Since the Slippery Rock meet,
the harriers have run badly. They
were shut out by Navy and nar-
rowly averted the same fate
against Penn State, Ohio Univer-
sity, and West Virginia.

Outlook Poor

The prospects are not much
brighter for the upcoming meet.
The team will travel to Morgan-
town to face the same West Vir-
ginia crew which trounced them,
17-40 at Schenley Park two
weeks ago.

The Mounties will again send

Roger Meador, Chuck Rea,,Don

against the Panthers. These are
the runners who showed their

heels to the entire Panther team
as they ﬁnished in the ﬁrst four
places.

This meet will conclude th e
Panthers’ season. The only thing
that will remain is the IC4A meet.
“There is a possibility ‘we will
send Larry Robinson to the meet,
but only if he wins against West
Virginia,” Rees stated. Robinson
has ﬁnished ﬁrst for the Cats in
every meet, but has trailed a total

of 16 opposing runners in the ﬁve
meets.

In the freshman IC4A meet the
Panthers will be represented by
Dave Eichenlaub and Don Hinch-
berger who have been 1-2 for the
Cubs in three meets.

PAUL DIETZEL, Army’s new
football coach from LSU, is the
“biggest Louisiana grab since
Jefferson snowed Napoleon,” ac-
cording to Maury «Allen of the
New York Post.

Learning never stops for engineers at Western Electric

There's no place at VVeslcrn Electric for engi-
neers who lee] that college diplomas signify
the end of their education. However, if a man
can meet our quality standards and feels that
he is really just beginning to learn . . . and if he
is ready to launch his career where learning is
an important part of the job and where gradu-
ate—levcl trainingon and off the job is encour-
aged — we want and need him. .

At'\Vcstern Electric, in addition to the nor-
mal learning-whileydoing, engineers are en-
couraged to move ahead in their ﬁelds by sever-
:11 types of educational programs. \/Vestern
maintains its own lull-time graduate engineer-
ing training program, seven formal manage-
mcnt courses, and a tuition refund plan for
out-of-hours college study.

This learning atmosphere is just one reason
why a career at \Vestern Electric is so stimu-
lating. Of equal importance, however, is the
nature of the work we do. Our new engineers
are taking part in projects that implement the
whole art of modern telephony, from high-
speed sound transmission and solar cells to
electronic telephone ollices and computer—con-
trolled production techniques.

Should you join us now, you will be coming

to VVestern Electric at one of the best times in
the company’s history. In thedmanagement
area alone, several thousand supervisory jobs
are expected to open up to W.E. people within
the next 10 years. And our work of building

communications equipment and systems be-

comes increasingly challenging and important
as the communications needs of-our nationland
the world continue to increase.

Challenging opportunities exist now at Western
Electric for electrical, mechanical, industrial, and chemi-
cal engineers, as well as physical science, liberal curls,
and business moiors. All qualified applicants will re-
ceive cureful considcrolion: for employment without
regard to race, creed, color or national origin. For more
information about Western Electric, write College Relo-
lions, Western Electric Company, Room 6206, 222
Broadway, New York 38, New York. And be sun 99
arrange for a Western Electric interview when our
college representatives visit your campus. '

i0PI’ONENT—-HOME

Wrestling and volleyball will be
the only sports contested this tri-
mester when school resumes after
the Thanksgiving vacation, it was
learned at the weekly meeting of
the intrafraternity athletic coun-
cil on Monday.

The wrestling.program will not ’

get underway, however, until
about the first week of December.

John Jenkins of Delta Sig pre-
sided over the meeting at which
several complaints about the pre-
sent intramural set-up were ex-
pressed. The Greeks said that the
physical education ‘ department

should provide referees for the‘

games. ’

raternity Athletic Council
Complains About Laissez-Faire

They noted that physical educa-
tion majors are required to put in
15 hours of refereeing in this
level of play. Leo’ Bemis, the di-
rector of the program, has offered
anyone $1.15 to referee the intra-
mural football games.

They complained about the
lack of hard-fast rules and the
time limits of contests. It was
said that the fraternities should
have a regular league rather
complete in a double-elimina-
tion competition.

They also asked that sports be
_weighted according to importance
so that the football championship
would mean more than the ping
pong crown.

Lawyers Dominate Ijll;
Delta Sigs Zllove Up

Only four games were played in the intramural football
leagues this week. Three games were played in the Indepen-
dent League, and one in the Interfraternity‘ “A” League.

Apartment “C” was eliminated from the Independent

League, and Theta Chi from the¢

‘A”, League. .

Law School “B” evened its rec-
ord at 1-1 as the Lawyers down-
ed the Rhapitts, 6-0. The only
score came in the ﬁrst half when
Don Rosetti hit Bill Nolan with
a pass that resulted in a 60-yard’
touchdown play.

Apartment “C” forfeited to the
Goyids, 6-0.
