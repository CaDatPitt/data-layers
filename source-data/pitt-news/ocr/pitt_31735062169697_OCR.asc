‘Pressured’ Chancellor Complies   

‘Positively’ With Blac emands

’ by GEORGE LIES
x ‘ Associate Editor

Pressured’ by a seven hour lock-in by about 25 to 30
black students at the Un1vers1ty_’s computer center, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar complied “pos1t1vely” early Thursday morning
with the “better action for blacks” demands of the group. ,

_The students, many of them members of the Black Action
Society (BAS), began their lock-in at the eighth floor center
Wednesday between 8 and 9 p.m. They left Thursday at 3 a.m.,
when Dr. Posvar signed an agreement which in ‘effect said

that:

—- There would be no punitive measures taken against any
of the demonstrating members, provided-the computerequip-

ment was in good shape.

— The University would provide better action on the de-

mands of black students.

-— An institution for black students would be established,
which would provide scholarships andfinancial aidto blacks.

— A special recruiter and a recruiting team, to be screened
by the BAS, be established to recruit more black students to

the school.

—— A special section in the Hillman Library be setup for

black students.

, — Two black holidays be recognized during the school year. The
two dates, which must be approved by the Faculty Senate, were Jan.
15,. birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, and Feb. 21, annoversary

of the death of Malcolm X.
The Chancellor signed the
statement, ending five hours of ne-

.gotiations with administrators and

university security forces.

Earlier in the day, a series of
incidents led up to the Chancel‘ '
lor’s statement. .

Black students, in groups of 10
or 12, entered regular campus
classrooms during the day and read
a statement saying, “The Black
Action Society requests that
classes be cancelled in commem-
oration of this day (Dr. King’s
birthday) . ’ ’

About 55 to 65 black students
staged a‘ demonstration in the
Chancellor’s office at 12:30 p.m.
Dr. Posvar was not in at the,time.
The students waited to meet with
Dr. Posvar until 3 p.m. when he
returned to his office. They re-

Student reaction to yester-
day’s protest by the Black Ac-
tion Society and its junior assis-
tants varied from total agree-
ment to total disagreement.

One black student noted that
"lt’s about time this happened,
now the Chancellor will be-aware
of student demands."

A white junior male said, “It’s
stupid, ridiculous, immature; if
white students did that they would
be locked up in jail. You watch,”
he added, “nothing will come of
this.”

The fact that nothing serious
will happen seemed to be the re-
action of the majority of students
until a group of about 20 blacks
began harassing students in the
Towers lobby. Several confronta-
tions occurred between passer-
by white students and the blacks
standing around.’ Afterwards, it

   

was learned that the majority of

 

quested that classes be cancelled
for the day.

Three small fires struck the
Cathedral of Learning; the first
was started when a cigarette was
thrown in a waste paper basket
on the 17th floor. Smoke stream-
ed to the 22nd floor. '

The second and third fires hit
the basement of the Cathedral,
about 9 p.m. Fires had broken out
in the carpentry and paintshops.
City fire departments brought the
incidents under control. Police
said the major portion of the base-
ment floor was covered by about
an inch of water.

Fire damage was minimal, con-
fined to cans of paint, wood, rools
of paper, and the rafters and stor-
age bin containing carpentry ma-
terials.

 

Ret

At about 10 p.m. the normal
closing time of all entrances to
the Cathedral, blacks with blank-
ets and provisions attempted to en-
ter the main entrances. Apparent-
ly, there were headed to the eighth
floor to provide for their com-
rades.

University police barred their
‘entrance. Fifteen minutes later,
about 20 city officers were dis-
patched to the scene after a phone
call by an administrator.

Shortly thereafter, everyone. in-
cluding press media, curious on-
lookers, and the blacks with pro-
visions were ordered to evacuate
the premises.

Most of the night classes were
cancelled after smoke filled the
towering rooms of the Commons
Room, and many of the evacuated
students apparently surprised, ques-
tioned what was going on as they
left the building.

This reporter who made it to
the eighth floor, despite reports
thatpolice barred the staircases,
saw the scene:

Four faculty members of the
computer school stood on the
eighth floor. A black youth, dres-

the blacks who were causing the
trouble in the lobby were not Uni-

those who were visiting to leave.

"I don’t care if they burn the
Cathedral to the ground, as long

as they don’t bother other stu- .

dents, I feel they have a right to

 

do their own thing,” one freshman
girl stated.

The incidents in the Towers
lobby seemed to provoke many
students who were either un-
aware of or unconcerned about
the lock-in at the Cathedral.

sed in a leather jacket and a black
beret, stood guard in front of the
glass doors of the computer cen-
ter. The doors were fastened by a
chair from within.

Joe McCormick, a member of
the group locked-in, spoke through
the doorway opening. He said
“We’ll issue a statement later.”

Subsequent telephone calls
to the computer center brought
these results:

The Pitt News: (11:45 p.m.

Wednesday) How long will you re-'

main in there?

McCormick: It’s our policy not
to say anything. We’-ll issue a

a statement within 48 hours.

The Pitt News: (about 2:45
a.m., Thursday) We want to find
out how long you will remain
there. What do you want from the
Chancellor? \ i

A girl’s voice: I’m sorry we
can’t say anything. You'll have to
talk with our mediator. Just a
minute.

Curtiss- Porter, Black Action
Society program coordinator:
“We’ll be here until we have to.
We’ll issue a statement later.”

in the right way,” one coed men-
tioned to her friend, as an inno-
cent passer—by was slapped in the
face by two black girls.

Before the incidents in the
dorms caused students to realize
the serious intent of the blacks,
the atmosphere seemed very sim-
ilar to that of_ the riots last
spring. Many of the male students
were running from the dorms to

the Cathedral to see the fire

trucks, saying things like, “This
is really neat” to “If I catch any
of those niggers, l’ll kill them.”

“We snould put ourselves in
their. place,” one sophomore girl
stated. ’

“They’re just looking for pub-
licity,” her friend answered.

Une junior history major sum-
med up the opinion of many

' whites who don’t understand the

whole black movement here when
he said, “It’s hypocritical. Mar-
tin Luther King was a pacifist;
he stood for peace and non-vio-
flence. This is the opposite of what
he preac_hed’.” . ‘

At about 12:50 a.m. Wednes-
day approximately 70 blacks en-
tered the Chancellor’s office de-
manding to meet with Dr. Wesley
Posvar. The Chancellor was not
in,
Guards «were placed at the door

as the other blacks sat around
the outer office. They played bon— '

go drums and conversed. The

guards allowed people to enter 4
and leave at the requestof the‘

secretary.

“There was no destruction an N
no trouble,” the office secretary ‘ 1’
said. “They just played the bon- ' "

goes and. talked quietly. Some of

them were muttering something-‘ 
about ‘nothing being done.”’ 

At about 3 p.m., the Chancellor 
returned and subsequently met ’

with the blacks. They talked for
approximately 30 minutes, during
which no one was permitted en-
trance of the room.

“The black students requested , 
to be excused from classes to-’-
- day in memory of Martin Luther‘

King’s birthday,” said Dr. Pos-

var. Dr. Posvar told them he ‘

‘would allow any student who so
desired to. be officially excus-
ed from their classes yesterday.

“The students were respect-
ful and orderly,” Dr. Posvar re-
peated over and over again.

When asked if the blacks had

made any threats the Chance1- ,

lor replied there was some “ang-

ry rhetoric” which probably in-,

cludes “tacit threats”.

Dr. Posvar indicated that the
BAS reiterated their demands of
this past summer. They voiced a

general dissatisfaction with the‘

progress of the demands. “I am‘
dissatisfied with the progress
myself,”
“We have made commitments
on various occasions. We are go-

ing .to continue our efforts for '

them.”

This campus has finally been awak-
, ened to the severity of a grave prob-
.— lem, and this is the dilemma of the
black students on this campus. The
black students of this campus have
talked and debated numerous times
lwith the Chancellor and different
" members of the administration and
faculty, in hopes of getting some an-

swers and solutions to their problems.

The Chancellor, on the whole, has
"cloaked his answers and solutions in
the safety of administrative red tape.
 My philosophy of this crisis, is
 very, very, idealistic. Iguess many
would say almost to the point of sheer
' idiosy. You see, I have this crazy idea
. about people . . . . about human nature,
 that man is going to one day, very
, soon, wake up.

other is the only thing that is going to
keep our world alive. Becuase of this
philosophy,iand my love for all peo-
ple, not just my own black race, I can
take the hate and injustice, inherent in
our world, maybe with just a little
more patience than the normal indi-
vidual of my race.

I seek to endure the bitter disap-
pointments that my philosophy suffers
each day.

I seek to endure the pain and an-
guish of not being ableto reach so
many people—of not being able to make
them realize and understand the im-
portance of love.

To me there is really no other way

of saving the black man, and the world.
But my philosophy——which really isn’t

. mine, but that of men like Martin Lu-

ther King, Jr., and Mahatma Ghandi.
I would rather die than think any other
way. ’

world has endured opression since the

times of slavery, and even up until to-
day this oppression and slavery has not
changed. You have to realize that the

 

system of today’s world is destroyinkgii:
the black man.

When someone’s virtual existence
is threatened, what else is there to do,
but to lash out at that thing which is
trying to destroy it.

The black man’s back is against the
wall of this so-called great, world. He
has backed up as far as he can, and
will go.

I HAVE NOTHING but the ut-
most admiration and respect for those
young men and women of my race,
who have, in many cases staked their
entire futures and lives on the eighth
floor of the Cathedral of Learning.

These students, my black borthers:
and sisters, also have a philosophy, and
although different from my own, if
they sincerely believed in what they
were doing, if they really felt that they
were justified, if each one of them ac-
tually followed his own conscience,
then they are to be envied.

University police give signal to ‘evacuate.’

The Village That Died  

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

The ape - like Neanderthal m a n
came out of his cave and looked up at
the sky. He was going out for his daily
hunt. He walked that day—he walked
to the river to kill a mammal with his
stone spear. His spear was his life; it
provided his food. He killed to live.
It was his law of nature. '

He -lived in a small village of caves.
His friends were just like him. They, too,
had to hunt each day. Sometimes, all the
men of the village would go down to the
river, and later in the day the whole com-
munity would have a feast. Those feasts
were happy times for the cave men. Ev-
erybody laughed, and some of the men
beat on the logs playing some unknown
tune.

ALL WAS PEACEFUL in the village
until some of the foreigners from across
the river—the war people——started throwing
their clubs at the villagers. One day the
war people invaded the village. There was
some bloodshed. But the war people were
not conquerers. After beating on the Vill-
age people and draging off some of their
women, they went back across the river.

The village people—the hunters—cou1d-
n’t understand the weird people from
across the river. Why did they kill, and
why did they invade the village, and why

didthey drag off the women‘? No one in —

the village,'not even the Headman, seem-
ed to know. -

BUT SOON THE village people stop-
ped asking questions. They didn’t want to
learn anything about the war people. They
knew now that they hated the foreign peo-
ple from across the river. Why, those peo-
ple didn’t even speak the same language.
And they dressed differently. They hated
all those bastards from across the river.

The men stopped going to the river in
their groups. The people no ‘longer held
their feasts. No laughing, no drum play-
ing. The village people started to look
keenly at each other. On that day, the vill-
age people, for some reason, just started
grabbing each others throast. And the area
outside the caves was cluttered with still
forms, eyes wide open, mouths gaping_and
heads battered.

THE VILLAGE DIED that day. And
the people from across the river traveled
to that deserted ghost-like village. They
settled down in the caves, went on group
hunts down at the river, had villagefeasts,
laughed with one another, and played the
drums.

But the new village people were also
invaded by other people from across the

river. The new village people started to-

hate each other.’ And they killed each
other.

The new village died that day. so did
the human race. . . ‘

Uselessness: A
Strange Feeling

by BRUCE LEVENSON
Staff News Editor

Sometimes I feel useless.

Sometimes I really feel like doing something, yet either I f

haven’t the means to do it or the foggiest notion of how to do it.

Take the time this past summer when the Black Action So-
ciety was forming. I used to walk past the BAS office, which is
right down the hall from the newspaper offices, nearly everyday.

THERE WAS A sign that said “Black Action Society” on
the door, but the door was always closed. I often wondered what
went on behind that door. I had heard rumors that the BAS was
an organizations of black students dedicated to the uplifting of
the black community. I wanted to help. It was something that
I believed in. I was anxious to meet the people that sat behind

the door that sat behind the sign.

One night I passed that door
with a female reporter from the
news staff. She asked me what
went on behind the doors, I half-
jokingly told her to press her ear
up against the door and see if she
could find out. She leaned against
the door and it suddenly opened.
An angry black student asked us
what we wanted. I said that we
were reporters and wanted to
know what the BAS was all about.
He replied that he didn’t wantto tell

usseveral nights later I met a few
BAS members in the fourth floor
hallway. They stated that the Pitt
News was racist and working
counter to their ideals. I argued
against this completely erroneous
notion. I was called a “racist bas-
tard” and an “ignorant pig” by
people who didn’t so much as know
my name much less. my beliefs.
They also accused the Pitt News of
attempting to break into their of— '
fice a few nights earlier.

AFTER THE INITIAL shock,
a feeling of uselessness invaded my
spirit. I attempted to set up an in-
terview with the BAS to see if I
could alleviate some of the up-
tightness and animosity that existed
between that organization and the
Pitt News and myself.

Finally, one of them decided to
speak with me. I think that he
was able to realize that I did not
possess a racist nature. And I
learned that I truly was ignorant.
I le a r n e d that m y intentions,
though sincere, were basically pa-
ternalistic. I also learned that I
was equating b_lack ambitions with
white ambitions. This BAS mem-
ber showed me the errors in my
thinking for which I am still grate-
ful.

For I, too, am an idealist. I like
to look at individuals rather than
groups. I hoped that my knowledge
would help me to find a direction

 

co'uld.v_ in;._,my . own  u,seless.V 

‘small way, help black people to

help themselves.
I had hoped that my conversa-

tion would be the beginning of a‘

continuous dialogue between my-
self and the BAS. I thought that
this would be an educational pro-
gram for me in which I could
learn to bring about an ideal that
I still believe in — one people liv-
ing in harmony instead of groiiégs
of people fighting each other.

THAT ‘LONE conservation was
the beginning and the end of that
dialogue.

Since that time the BAS has been
indifferent to me as well as other
white students on campus.

I can’t buy the separatist philos-
ophy of the BAS. I now know that
I haven’t had most of the ex-
periences that the black person has
had. I know that our backgrounds
are as different as night and day.
Yet, I also believe strongly that
there is a common ground be-
tween blacks and whites.

Often I have walked past the
BAS office, seen the door open,
heard the music of Hugh Mase-
kela, and longed to walk in there,
sit down with someone and just
talk about how much I dug that
cat’s sounds.

JUST AS IT is wrong for whites

to believe that all blacks are bad, -

it is wrong for blacks to think that
all whites are bad. There are
whites many of them, who be-

‘ lieve as emphatically in equality

and justice as do blacks. BAS, you
can’t make it without us. You can
hate us as much as you like but
you can never diminish pur ideals.

I must be stubborn as hell to

 

cling to my, beliefs. I sure feel
