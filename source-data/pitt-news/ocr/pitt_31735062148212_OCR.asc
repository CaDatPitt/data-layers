Athletic Committee Votes
To Discontinue Hockey
Competition This Season

Poor Facilities, Lack o

f Intercollegiate Control,

Lead to Decision of Faculty Group Last Night

Pitt will not be represented by a11 intercollegiate hockey team

this year.

Because of lack of facilities and lack of intercollegiate control,

‘the University will discontinue its
night by the Faculty Committee
on Athletics.

“The Committee felt it unde-
sirable to continue hockey under
the conditions which existed last
year,” explained James Hagan,
director of athletics, in announcing
the decision of the Faculty Commit-
tee.

At last night’s meeting in the Uni-
versity Club, the committee further
went on record as being enthusias-
tically in favor of the reestablishment
of hockey at the University, both on
an intramural and -collegiate basis, as
soon as facilities are available.

Chief points of dissatisfaction with
the status of hockey at the Univer-
sity last year were the poor oﬂi;ciat-
ing at the league games, and the
uncertain practice periods in Du-
quesne Garden for the Pitt team.

The problem of retaining hockey
as a University sport was ﬁrst dis-
cussed by the Faculty Committee last
spring, and the group exhausted all
possible alternatives before deciding
yesterday to drop hockey.

At the present time, eﬁorts are
under way to ﬁnd out the cost of a
University hockey arena, and the
conditions under which it could be
constructed.

Women to Open
Formal Rushing

Formal rushing for February fresh-
men and upperclass women will take
‘place next Sunday, announces Mary
Letsche, C40, chairman of the rush-
ing rules committee of Penhellenic
Association.

Rushees will be entertained at teas
from 3 to 5 o’clock at the various
fraternity houses. Panhellenic rules
‘stipulate that each girl must attend
only one tea during the afternoon.

Invitations have been sent out to
approximately seventy-ﬁve girls out
of a list of ninety eligibles. Accord-
ing to Miss Letsche, this is an unusu-
ally large number for fall rushing.

Starting Monday silence week will
go into effect. During this time there
will be no association between rush-
fees and fraternity women.

Fraternities must have their bid
lists in the office of the dean of wo-
men before 9:30 o’clock, Tuesday
Preferential ballots will
then be sent to those girls whose
names have appeared on a bid list.

The fraternities will get their ac-
ceptance lists at 5 o’clock, Friday, No-
vember 17. Formal bids will be sent
out that evening.

going into the conference room,
where the women reporters were to

promptly escorted out.

It had been prearranged that we
were to follow a certain cameraman
(at his suggestion) into the room but
we were discovered and the cam-

his life.” But then came Mrs. Roose-

and the advice to “make yourself in-

Seated around Mrs. Roosevelt

now to the ﬁrst lady who amid all

Current Events Poll in 1916 Shows
Lack of Knowledge About World l/‘Var

This is the sixth in a series-of articles tracing the road to war as 're—¢
flected in The Pitt Weekly of 1914..1918,
student attitude as they existed during this period.

By Dorothy Cleland
It is difﬁcult to say just why the students at the University did not seem
to be interested in the ﬁrst World War.
tion can be found in the fact that American college students in general had
very little knowledge at this time of what was really going on in the
A

This series attempts to present

Perhaps the answer to that ques-

world beyond their campuses.

This, at least, was the opinion of
numerous n e w s p a p e r editors,
throughout the country. According to
statistics quoted by the Weekly edi-
tors, current events exams had been
given. at Bowdoin college, New York
university, and at other colleges and
universities. The results showed
that hardly any of the students could
answer the very simple questions,
“Who is Hindenburg?” and “Who is
the ruler of Russia?”

Concern over the poor showing of
these students was reﬂected not only
in the Weekly, but in non-college pa-
pers all over the country. The gen-
eral opinion was that the students
‘must not have been reading the news-

papers. One editor said, “What are
we to think of methods of teaching
which shelve the present for the past,
and the professors who imagine they
are teaching history when four-ﬁths
of their students do not know
whether Winston Churchill or Von
Bethmann-Hollweg is the Prime Min-
ister of England.”

Some though that it was the fault
of the students themselves, that their
own inertia might have been the
cause. The Pitt editors thought that
a similar test at the University would
be a good idea to ﬁnd out just how
much the students here knew.

Again the idea of ROTC training
was brought before the students, and
again" the editors of the Weekly

agreed with the plan.

With the coming of Easter and the
battle of Verdun, the editors suggest-
ed that students interest themselves
in things nearer home. The editorial
said, “So, while we are agreed that
the War‘ in Europe is a terrible thing,
and everything possible should be
done to mitigate its cruelty, or check
its progress, the though of Easter re-
minds us forcibly of more vital and
practical duties that lie nearer home

. . European wars will prove to be
of secondary consideration, compared
with the wonderful opportunities ly-
ing immediately at elbow.” The war,
in spite of its progress, was still rather
far away and unreal to them.

Even by Memorial day there was
no fear that we might have more
disabled veterans and “honored dead”
to lament in a few years. There was
no looking ahead on that Memorial
day in 1916; there was only looking
back. To University students, and
to many other people, the idea of our
participation in the European war

was inconceivable._

Our English Visitors Debate
On a Pointed Subject

To our campus tonight come two representatives from Oxford
University to participate in a “split” debate with two University
men on a subject which is expressed. in terms which are as straight-
forward as could be devised.

One Oxford man and one Pitt man will attempt to persuade the v

other pair “That the United States should declare war against Ger-
many.” When they chose this subject, the University men, in addi-
tion to ﬁnding a clever point for advance publicity, struck directly
to the point of any possible debate between Englishmen and Ameri-
cans at this time.

"We assume that England wouldn’t mind having a little direct‘
aid from America in cracking the Siegfried line. American airplanes
and other wa.r materials, released to the Allies by the newly—amended
neutrality act, will be helpful, but the full weight of America’s man-
power and wealth would provide the crowning stroke in John Bull’s
campaign against‘ the Nazis.

Of course, tonight’s debate will be merely academic; no one
really feels that we will heed the direct and obvious appeal for sym-
pathy with the English and immediately dash off to a 1939 no-man’s-
land. ,

Debating may be a form of good clean college fun, but tonight ’s
will be as serious as any Pitt debate has been. The question of par-
ticipation in this war may come before the nation again, and the only
formal debateon the subject may be heard in Congress. America
still has a thing or two to remember from the last time the question
of war was answered in the affirmative. I

The really useful thing we learned from that experience is that
fire does burn if one insists on sticking his ﬁnger into the blaze.

No matter which side presents the better argument tonight, we
will consider the pro-war debaters the losers. Witli this attitude, we
may be guilty of judging the case before it‘ is heard. But we feel
strongly that the United "States should not go to war against Germany
or against any other nation.

Considering what past wars have decided or saved for the world,
it should take much more than the desire to settle another European
mess of power politics to make American men revert to chi1d_hood
days and go to play in the mud again—European mud.

Pitt Plays Carnegie Tech
On Saturday Afternoon Only

Pitt”s football team plays Carnegie Tech at the Stadium on
Saturday afternoon at 2 o’clock. The game will end at about 4:30
o’clock that afternoon.

V\7e believe we’re safe in saying that the overwhelming majority
of students of both schools are satisﬁed to allow the intra-city rivalry
to be settled Saturday afternoon by the two football teams. We’re
not being “sissy” about this—-—we’re just being sensible.

Raids on the campus of the other school, damage to property,
and ﬁghting can produce no good results. Instead, they may lead
to an outbreak of bitterness like the one which followed the Pitt-
Duquesne game. Affairs of this type are deplored by the sensible
elements in the student bodies of all three city schools.

To point to an authoritative statement of student feeling, we
feel it worth while to reprint the policy drawn up last week by
representatives of Student—Faculty Association and of Carnegie
Tech’s Student Council. The statement follows:

The winning team shall receive or retain the Pitt-Tech goal-
posts from the representative of the losing team at a. time suitable
to both groups on the Monday following the game.

The game is played on the ﬁeld. It should not be carried on
either before or after the contest.

By the establishment of this tradition of good sportsmanship
good feeling will be fostered between the two institutions and per-
sonal injury and property damage will be outlawed.

The invasion of the campus of the other school is considered
not to be good sportsmanship.

William Green’s Daughter Demonstrates

That She is William Green’s Daughter

By Jack Brady

the labor union.
Miss Green explained what the AF

vantages of the American Federation

affairs for ﬁfteen minutes, Miss Clara
M. Green, daughter of William Green,
president of the AFofL, must have
been spinning herself if she ex-
pected University students to ap-
preciate her “address” entitled “The
Round Earth Spins.”

Miss Green began her one hour-.
and-ﬁfteen—minute talk by pointing
out the necessity of students taking
advantage of the wonderful oppor-
tunities provided at the University
and then tapered off to a discussion
of the international situation. She
ﬁnally rambled into a treatise on the
reasons for the recent failure of a
peace proposal between the AFofL
and the CIO. .

Finally getting down to the under-
lying purpose of her discussion, “The
advantages of the American Federa-
tion of Labor and the American way,”
is Green gave the past history of

ofL was endeavoring to do for the
working man and his family, and
how arbitration methods had been
used to help both workers and em-
ployer in labor conﬂicts. She con-
tinued, “I am not sponsored by any
organization or by the AFofL.”

Referring to the split between the
unions in 1935, Miss Green main-
tains that the Lewis faction was not
satisﬁed with a majority decision of
the national convention and so or-
ganized a new and opposing union.

“Boss rule is the government of
the CIO and any member with any
ideas different from the leader’s is
relieved of his office the morning
following the meeting,” asserted Miss
Green.

Again Miss Green declared that she
was not sponsored by any organiza-
tion and continued, “after a recent
CIO convention many of the union

It was with great chagrin that the
members of the 1VIen’s Debating Asso-

the University newspaper lack access
to a dictionary in their office. The
members have decided to take up a
contribution in order to remedy this
great deﬁciency.

In the meantime, however, we,
ourselves, should like to instruct The
News editor in the intricacies of the
English language. Having learned
through debating to be thoroughly
accurate and authoritative in all our

FROM THE

SI DELINES

By BILL McELW'AIN
Sports Editor

ANOTHER INDICATION that any-
thing is possible in sports is the pro-
motion of Bud Hawkins to ﬁrst string
center on the not-t0o—staunch Panther
line. Hawkins would be the ﬁrst to
admit that, when the season started,
he was deﬁnitely not in the running
for the number one pivot man spot.

A fair blocker and a line backer
whose smashing tackles belie his 165
pounds, Hawkins has been used in-
frequently in his two and half sea-
sons at Pitt because of one fault, his
sloppiness in snapping the ball to the
backs.

When the current season began.
Hawk was still missing the ball car-
rier with deadly inaccuracy, but con— I
tinual practice brought improvement. I
Finally, when he got his chance
against Temple, it was because he
was more certain in his passes than
Steve Sinco, husky sophomore who
had been counted on as Dick Fuller-
ton’s replacement.

:1: 95 :1:

CARNEGIE TECH is still bothered
with quarterback trouble, but the
difficulty is no longer merely a mat-
ter of blocking and defensive play.
Bill Kern is worried over his signal-
callers’ memories.

It seems that the Tartans had been
saving two plays all year for Notre
Dame. They were sure-ﬁre scorers
and Kern had instructed his quarter-
backs to watch for a spotand use
the plays when they would be of most
value.

One of the Plaid quarterbacks even
had the plays written on the adhe-
sive tape around his wrist. But the
writing either wore off or the Tartan
ﬁeld general forgot to look at his
wrist. He didn’t use the plays and
no one knows yet what they were.

:;: * :1:

NO MATTER WHAT you may
think of I‘-uquesne’s athletic policies
or how lucky you may think the
Dukes were against Pitt, you have to
hand it to Buff Donelli’s boys for be-
ing scrappers.

Against the Panthers, Duquesn
was a team that refused to be beaten.
When the breaks presented them-
selves, the Dukes made the most of
them. '

Texas Tech might have pulled an
upset the following week for the
Dukes were letting down after the
Pitt game. But the Dukes made sure
that they let down only so far, and it
wasn’t far enough for Texas Tech.

The Marquette game was a repeti-
tion of the Pitt score. The Dukes
spotted Marquette 13 points and won
21-13. That might happen once on
breaks, but twicein three weeks is
no coincidence.

Air A_t—taok Gives
Phi Gams Victory

Using a diversiﬁed air attack and
ground game to good advantage, the
Phi Gamma Delta touch footballers
turned back the Phi Kappa Alpha
team 12 to 6 Monday.

The ﬁrst score came in the opening
minutes of the second half when Phi
Gam passer Vvatson riﬂed a touch-
down pass to Dirnit for a tally. The
try for conversion was blocked. The
Phi Kap score came by virtue of an
interception by Elling. A pass for the
extra point failed to tie the score.

Phi Gamma Delta scored their sec-
ond touchdown on a long pass from
Vvatson to Edmunds, and again the
try for point after touchdown was no

In Saturday’s Battle
Between City Rivals

This coming Saturday, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh engages Car-
negie Institute of Technology in a
football game that might‘ have
been the biggest game of the cur-
rent season but for four reasons.

At the outset of the season, Carne-
gie was favored to win the eastern
championship and national fame
while Pitt was to have been lucky
to capture three games.

A quick glance at the records show
Carnegie with three victories and two
defeats, while the Panthers have
notched four wins and two losses.
Riot in 1919

to 1906 when the Panthers’ trimmed
the defenders of the plaid, 31-0. Win-
gard piloted the Pitt eleven and Dr.
G. C. Challinor, a W&J grad, bossed
the Tartans.

Snce that date, the two teams have
met 24 times with the Jungle Cats
emerging victorious 18 times, tying
one, and suffering defeat in ﬁve frays.

A break in the series occurred be-
tween 1919 and 1923 due to a riot fol-
lowing the former game. When play
was resumed in 1933, Tech won its
ﬁrst game, 7-2. , V

Much water has gone over the dam
since the two teams ﬁrst met. Pitt
has, said good-bye to such coaches as
Moorehead, Warner, Sutherland, and
others. Tech coaches over that same
period included the late Judge “Wal-
ly” Steffen, Bob Waddell and Howard
Harpster.

Tech Leads in Upsets .

This year’s game diffe-rs from all
past games as neither team is given
much of an advantage. In past games.
either Pitt or Tech had been a heavy
favorite, and the
game usually fol-

fowed the form
sheet.

x O n l y t h r e e
games have re-
sulted in upsets

with Tech holding
the advantage in
this respect. Tech
was scheduled to
win in 1930 but
the Panthers eked
out a 7-6 win.
- In 1935 a great
Pitt team was held

__ Gradisek

by a ﬁghting Tech eleven. And in
1938 Pitt’s “dream backﬁeld” came
out second best to Tech’s Carnelly,
Muha, Lee, and Condit. A

Comparative scores of this year’s
games are even-stephen thus far.
Both teams have engaged the Tem-
ple Owls, with Tech winning a 6-0
decision, and the Panthers taking a
13-7 victory.

Same Starters for Skibos

In the past three years, the Tartans
have scored more points against Pitt
than any other team over the same
number of years.

Tech will ﬁeld. practically the
same line-up which started against
the Irish two weeks ago. Fisher and
Church will be at the terminals, Pru-
gar and Dobrus at the tackles, and
the center triumverate Kuinzle,
Schmidt, and Reith.

In the backfield “Chang” Dunn or
Chris Moersch will call the signals,
Muha and Condit. the touchdown
twins will pair up at the halfbacks,

good.

and Jerry White will start at fullback.

of October 21 and October 28 when seven winners were picked in 17 games.

But it begins to hurt after this week.

“Oh, it offends me to the soul”

to have picked seven winners in eight games, and then have the business
department of the News load up the sport page with advertising so that the

predictions had to be cancelled.

Something ought to be done about
it. Even my own fraternity brothers
are giving me the horse laugh.“ And
what’s more, so are the pledges.
That’s too much to take.

Except for the fact that Missouri
trimmed Nebraska, 27-13, eight out
of eight could be chalked up on the
right side of the ledger.

career The News track and cross-
country writer went awry in his pre-
meet predictions as the Penn State
Lions upset the Panther harriers in
frigid weather at Mt. Nittany last
week-end, 22-33. Pitt stock for the
ICAAAA title chances dropped to its
lowest value of the year as a result.

Captain Zeke Sterner and Al‘ Bou-
langer were the lone bright spots in
the meet from a Panther standpoint,
but even Sterner will have to im-
prove in the next two weeks if he is
to challenge the ICAAAA cross-coun-
try supremacy of Willie Smith, Lion
ace who beat.-him Saturday.

Until Sa.turday*s disappointment,
Sterner had performed more im-
pressively than his crack opponent.
However, Smith may have been. hold-
ing back in the earlier meets, and his
defeat by Michigan St-ate’s Roy Fehr
may have been an accident. Even so,
Sterner will make him. press at New
York, to gain a second win.

have been doing all the pressing. You
know their names, how good they
are. But who will they meet in the
finals?

Probably it will be the Newmans,
who are recuperating from a recent
defeat at the hands of the Punks and
are praying for another chance to
knock the kingpins from their perch.

The Phi Kaps have gone through
the season undefeated, and wear the
crown of the winners bracket. Pat
Cusick has done more than pound a

sensational victory. Snuffy Hughes

As yet the Engineers are jockeying

Metallurgists and the Chem Seniors

safe spot in the winners bracket, but
if Jaffe can be wrong, so can we.
