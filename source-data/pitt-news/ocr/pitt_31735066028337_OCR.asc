Dermis Donham, the vice chancellor for
student affairs, requested that an in-house
investigation be conducted after the alloca:
tions committee resigned last week, alleging
that top student-governrnent leaders misused

L Student Activities Director Joe Cavalla
said SGB funding request slips and other evi-
dence were reviewed by the student-activi-
ties department late last week. Its ﬁndings
were submitted to Donharn on Friday mom-
mg.
Neither SGB President Justin DalMolin
nor Allocations Committee Chairman
Gerald Klayrmn have produced receipts or
canceled checks to verify exactly how the

forms of documentation were looked at dur-
ing the investigation, but he did say there are
no plans to revamp what he called a “solid
allocations process.”

Former members of the allocations
board criticized the investigation as clandes-
tine and want the results of the investigation
made public. Donharn said that because the
investigation was interdepartmental, it could
not be released ,

According to the Pitt student—govem-
ment constitution, DalMolin is authorized to
act as the entire SGB and Klayman is per-
mitted to act as the entire allocations board
during the summer months. Resigning board
members accused Klayman of approving
DalMolin’s “luxuriant” requests and said the

The chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board said the Semester at Sea ship should not have been
permitted to leave port last week with over 600 students
aboard.

According to NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway, the
safety board is concerned because the S.S. Universe
Explorer was allowed to leave port without a sprinkler
system, when the cause of a July 1996 ﬁre aboard it is still
not known.

The NTSB released a statement questioning why the
Coast Guard, on Aug. 25, "enumerated seven pages" of
safety deﬁciencies and then, on Sept. 5, gave the ship per-
mission to leave port. ‘

The statement additionally said the NTSB is unaware
of any documentation concerning how the ship's owners
were to rectify the safety deﬁciencies and why the ship
was allowed to leave port without a sprinkler system.

money could have been spent more prudent-
ly.

Records indicate that nearly $11,()00
was approved this summer in the absence of
the full allocations committee, rather than the
$2,000 average that has been approved dur-
ing recent summers.

Early last week, Donham instructed
Cavalla to look into the accusations made
against DalMclin and Klayman by the 10-
member student-allocations board after they
resigned on Sept. 11. Donham saidthe inves-
tigation was “routine” under such circum-
stances.

The 10 members of the board—abody
that makes recommendations to the SGB
about how money should be disbursed to stu-
dent groups — criticized DalMclin and
Klayman for “gross misuse and manipula-
tion” of student funds. The board did not
implicate any other SGB members in its
accusations.

“The bottom line is that, unless I get
additional information, I don’t see that there
have been any [violations] of rules,”
Donham said “That’s not to say, in hind-
sight, they wouldn’t have done some things
differently.”

Cavalla conﬁrmed the report which
showed that no spending policies or proce-
dures had been violated, but also added that
“there may have been some errors in judg-
ment” as to how carefully the money was
spent.

“Justin was on university business and
student-governrnent business, and used the
money for that,” Cavalla stated.

DalMclin said he traveled to other
Pennsylvania universities in the summer to
rally support for a Pennsylvania State
Student Association. The PSSA, if estab-
lished, would act as a student lobbying arm
in Hanisburg.

He said the student government consid-
ers establishing the PSSA to be one of its
biggest goals for this year and that this was
why he pursued this so aggressively.

“I didn’t just want to let the summer
pass,” he said, calling Pitt’s involvement in
forming the PSSA “an investment.”

Klayman said he authorized the expens-
es for DalMclin because the activities were
an “asset” for Pitt students, and he added that
he “will stand by these decisions.”

“It wasn’t for [DalMclin], it was for the
students,” Klayman said.

The PSSA could decrease tuition in the
future and provide students with more ﬁnan-
cial aid, Klayman noted.

Joyce Giangarlo, the SGB adviser, stat-
ed that the University had made a commit-
ment to the PSSA, which justiﬁed the
expenses. ‘

“We made a commitment, not only for
our students, but for the students across the
state,” Giangarlo said “Things were blown
out of proportion.”

Klayman agreed with Giangario and
said‘ DalMclin and other SGB members are
justiﬁed in spending money in this way.

‘They are the elected representatives of
the University,” Klayman said ‘They have
the power to do it.”

Monday, 22 September 1997

[atria Pesci, one of the 10 allocations
board members who resigned, said the board
felt Da]Molin’s requests approved by
Klayman were technically legitimate but
“shady.” She said much of what the money
was spent on —— for example a $116 down-
town dirmer attended in June by DalMclin,
Klayman and SGB board member Brian
Reirner — was more luxurious than it need-
ed to be.

Klayman said that his board members

may have felt frustration at not being able to ,

control the spending because ultimately their
decisions could be overruled by the SGB.

Denied proposals may be resubnritted to
the allocations committee. If the recommen-
dations are again denied by the allocations
committee, the SGB can overrule the com-
mittee and approve the proposals.

SGB member Marquette Bowman said
the cornrr1ittee’s resignation may have been a
hasty decision.

“It’s really ditfrctrlt to accept that your
only job is [as] a recommending person,”
said Bowman. “We’re not there to cater to
our allocations committee, we’re there to
cater to our students.”

Pesci said while she was on the com-
mittee, the group strove to follow the alloca-
tions manual and the rules governing the dis-
bursement of funds. The allocations corrnnit-
tee ended last year with an almost $160,000
sruplus because of its mernbers' stringent
monitoring. This surplus prevented the stu-
dent activity fee, which is paid twice yearly
by students, from increasing this year.

“You either meet the requirements [for
an allocation of funds], or you don’t,” Pesci
said.

DalMclin defended himself against sev-

eral of the resigning board’s accusations pub-
lished in the Sept. 15 issue of The Pitt News.
Among his claims:
- He and three other SGB members rented a
Lincoln town carforatwo—day, $1,807 trip to
Temple University, DalMclin, who is 21,
said the car was contracted through
University Travel Service, and that the
upgrade was necessary once it was discov-
ered that UTS had booked the auto rental
through a corrrpany that required the driver to
be at least 25 years old.

DalMclin said that a “last-minute”
search to ﬁnd a car he was allowed to drive
yielded only the Lincoln town car within a
25-mile radius.

“We had to go at a moment’s notice,” he
said.

- DalMclin and Klayman said they required

$270 summer parking passes because their
work required them to come and go ﬁom the
oﬁce several times a day.
0 DalMclin also said he used personal checks
to pay back the difference in cases where he
was allotted too much money by Klayman
over the summer. He has been unable to pro-
vide any canceled checks to support this
claim.

VV1th the allocations committee's allega-
tions looming over the student government,
Donham said it’s impossible to tell when the
vacancies on the-committee may be ﬁlled.

“T‘here’s still a job to do,” Donham said.
“I wish some of the former members would
reconsider their decision and come back.”

Saturday night, while most of
Oakland was covered in the dark
blanket of night, Bigelow Boulevard
came alive with lasers and fire-
works.

The Pitt Program Council and '

Pitt's Alumni Association sponsored
a fireworks and laser light show on
Bigelow Boulevard, followed by a
Homecoming celebration in the stu-
dent union.

The fireworks, provided by
Zambelli Fireworks and
Electrastage Systems, and the lasers,
provided by Centrac, were set to
entertain the students and alumni
who gathered on Bigelow at 9:00
p.m.
As the lasers drew geometric
designs and panthers on the special
screen, streams of fireworks tower-
ing over Hillman Library filled the
sky with light as the "1812
Overture" split the night air. To the
applauding crowd, this was a fitting
finale — but the best was yet to
come.

As the lasers disappeared and
the streams of fireworks became
just a memory, the crowd started to
move until the unlit Cathedral of
Learning suddenly came to life.
Fountains of sparks and spinning

wheels were ignited abruptly from
different tiers of the Cathedral's
roof.

"The fireworks off the Cathedral
were very cool," freshman John
Mutter said.

On top of cheers and applause
from those gathered, music such as
Van Halen's "Panama" and Barry
Manilow's "Copacabana" filled the
air.

"The fireworks were great, and
so was the music," noted freshman
Sarah Root.

. After the Cathedral finale, the
crowd began to move toward the
William Pitt Union.

Many of the undergraduate stu-
dents in the crowd said they enjoyed
themselves and would return for the
fireworks next year, but that the
lasers weren't necessary.

Upperclassmen noticed that one
traditional part of the laser show
was "missing.

"Where was the laser Panther
that climbs up the Cathedral?"
senior Erik Heyeck asked.

PPC Director Tom Misuraca said
that because the trees in the area
still had leaves on them, it was not
possible for the lasers to get a clear
shot at the Cathedral. He added,
however, that next year, "no matter
what," the Panther would return.

Video games, dancers and bal-
loon animals invaded the William
Pitt Union on Saturday night as part
of the Homecoming activities.

The Pitt Program Council and
the Alumni Association sponsored
numerous activities in the Union to
help students and alumni celebrate
Homecoming.

The PPC filled the ballroom
with video games such as Oﬁ‘-Road
Challenge and X-Men for students
to test their skills. All of these
games could be played for free.

"It was a new idea for
Homecoming, and most people
seem to like it," said the PPC's
Angie Barnheart.

In the assembly room, the
Alumni Association provided a
dance floor and music from D.J.
Donn Mixx for the students and
alumni. The Pitt dance team attend-

ed the dance and performed parts of
its routine.

Throughout the Union, students
could get caricatures, balloon ani-
mals and even tarot-card readings.

"I think it's better than other
Homecomings, and the video games
get an A++," said junior Genezera
McIntyre.

Also part of the extravaganza
was a piano bar just off of the Red
Room with entertainment for people
over 21 years old.

With or without alcohol, stu-
dents and alumni enjoyed them-
selves. Some alumni commented
that the event was "a more memo-
rable Homecoming" than those
when they were students at Pitt.
Many students also agreed that
Homecoming celebrations like this
one would lure them back in the
future.

"If they did this again next year,
I'd come back," freshman Jessie
Pongracz said.

In October 1996 the NTSB made a
recommendation to the Coast Guard to
require sprinkler and alarm systems.
However, the ship was issued a deferment
on the sp1inkler—system requirement until
2005.

The Coast Guard initially upheld the
NTSB recommendations but later chose
to honor the deferment, allowing the ship

complete," Tymitz noted in the letter.

A parent of a Pitt student on board the
Universe Explorer, who did not want her
name used, said she is not worried that the
ship is unsafe. -

"I don't think they would have sent
all those students out on that ship if there
was any chance of something going
wrong," she said. "They don't need anoth-

. er situation like they had last year," refer-

ring to the April 1996 bus accident in
India that killed seven people, including
four Semester at Sea students.

The Universe Explorer was built in
1958 and damaged by the July 1996 ﬁre.

According to Holloway, the source
of the ﬁre is not known, and it is not
known if there is any danger of fire recur-
ring. « ~

The fire started in the laundry room.
Holloway said it is not known if the bulk-
heads, which are ﬁreproofed layers in the
wall, were in place in the laundry-room
area.

The ship's owner, Commodore
Cruise Line, said that the ship was totally
renovated after the fire. These renova-
tions inplude bulkheads, ﬁre doors, pho-

Chancellor
Nordenberg
murdered?

murdered Chancellor‘ Mark
Nordenberg in the Cathedral

Commons on Saturday night.

Well, not really.

But they pretended to.

As part of the Homecoming fes-
tivities this past weekend, the alum-
ni association sponsored its
"Murder Mystery Night."

In addition to the mystery, there
was a silent auction and the "Death
by Chocolate Buffet."

The "Murder Mystery" ran like
a live-action game of "Clue."

However, characters like the
hunched-backed Cathedral janitor,
played by David Fielding, and the
pouty girlfriend of a star football
recruit, played by Hillary Haft
Bucs, helped put a new twist on the
old game.

The play had four scenes in
which the characters conversed with
one another. In between the scenes,
the characters mingled with guests
and offered clues for a price. Clues
cost between $1 and $5, and the
more expensive the clue, the better
it was.

In the fourth and final scene, the
action reached its climax as
Nordenberg's acting came to the
fore. It became strikingly evident as
he spoke his lines why he chose to
become a chancellor and not an
actor.

As the action began,
Nordenberg was enjoying a 4 a.m.
break from his perpetual efforts
when he was attacked by what he
thought was the Cathedral ghost.
After a brief struggle with the
attacker, Nordenberg was thrown
from the mezzanine on the second
floor.

A gasp from the audience quick-
ly became a chuckle as those in
attendance realized it was a dummy.
The chuckles turned to laughter
when the dummy flopped to the
floor and the crowd got a glimpse of
it dressed in the same navy blue and
beige suit that Nordenberg wore,
with its unruly straw hair and a
ridiculously large pink nose.

After the action, the guests sub-
mitted their guesses as to the mur-
derer's identity, and people made
their final bids for the silent auc-
tion.

King and queen crowned

at Thursday's halftime

Staff Writer

A few of the signs are still up around
campus, but the campaigning is over. We
have our Homecoming king and queen.

The 1997 Homecoming king and
queen were armounced during half time of
Thursday night's nationally televised foot—
ball game versus 

The Homecoming court awaited the
armouncer’s every word to hear who
would be the king and queen. Before they
knew it, Ralph Dunniehigh and Heather
McNeish were being crowned by last

MYSTERY

An alumnus who now works as
an insurance investigator solved the
murder. She correctly deducted that
the rich African princess, played by
Kashi Johnson, had committed the
murder.

Johnson's character had had a
run-in with Nordenberg some years
earlier, and he knew that she was
not really a princess. The only way
to protect her image was to kill the
only person who knew the truth,
namely Nordenberg.

The cast of characters included
five MFA graduates of Pitt's theater
department who all played them-
selves, as well as several popular
Pitt faculty members. These includ-
ed: Jack Anderson, director of
bands; Carol Carter, vice chancel-
lor; Andrew Kuzneski, Jr., president
of the Pitt Alumni Association;
Steve Pederson, athletics director;
and Mary Jo Race, Nordenberg's
executive assistant.

The silent auction was held for
40 prize packages worth about $100
each. i

A raffle for door prizes original-
ly earned $975, but Nordenberg
bought the remaining tickets for
$25 to bring the total to $1,000.

During the "Murder Mystery"
action, the character of John Koch,
an MFA in theater, needed money
for a date with Laura Smiley's (also
a theater grad) character. He took
bids for the "lrish stew" prize,
which he sold for $700 to Mark
Milovats, chairman of the alumni
association's scholarship program.

All proceeds from the evening
went to the alumni scholarship
fund. The cost of the event was $15
per person, or $25 per couple.

According to Elaine Meisner, of
the Alumni Committee, the alumni
association provides scholarship
funding totaling $50,000 that sup-
ports 46 students.

Homecoming court selection is mindless

Alison Novicki

 

SGB finances should be
publicly investigated

Student Activities Director Joe Cavalla said he has no plans
to revamp what he describes as a “solid allocations process.”
But it is not a solid system at all.

The ﬂaws in the student-governrnent system are the reason
that a controversy exists right now. Student government has a
lot of power, and its members have shown that they can’t han-
dle it.

As far as we know, the SGB has not violated any policies,
but the spirit of the policies may lmve been compromised.
That’s why an allocations committee is supposed to exist — as
an objective eye to watch not only the letter of the law, but also
the spirit of the law. But that committee can do no good when
the only power it is granted is to make “suggestions.” The pol-
icy does not provide for a suﬂicient system of checks and bal-
ances.

Just because the board has the power to do certain things, it
does not follow that the board should do all those things. Just
because its members have the ability to do so does not make it
right.

As students who pay activities fees, we question SGB
President Justin DalMolin and Allocations Chair Gerald
Klayrnan’s judgment. We want an effective system for check-
ing their judgment. The current system does not work if the
SGB is not answerable to the students. _

And to make the SGB answerable to the students, we want
the details of the investigation made public.

There are a lot of questions left unanswered for the stu-
dents, including the necessity of such extravagant expenditures
as staying at a four—star hotel, $116 for a dimer for three in June,
and why nearly $11,000 was approved this summer compared
to the $2,000 average in previous summers.

We’re paying for these things. We want to be convinced
that the money is being spent wisely. If the SGB can justify
these costs, then there should be no reason why it will not
release the documentation. \

DalMolin and Klayman have cited many times their pro-
posed Pemisylvania State Student Association as justiﬁcation
for the expenditures. We like the idea of this association. But it
alone is not a good enough reason to justify all the expenditures.

If there is more evidence that will explain these costs, it
should be released to the students. This newspaper would be
happy to print it Like every other student, we’d like to know
that our money is being spent wisely.

columnlst

I don’t get it.

What does the impersonal,
costly and shallow race for the
“prestigious” title of “Homecoming
king/queen” have to do with school
spirit?

What exactly did the candi-
dates do that would have led any
student to believe that they could
represent the University of
Pittsburgh?

Hmmm, nothing?

If I understand correctly,
Homecoming week is about
expressing school spirit. It’s about
campus unity and pride for Pitt.

I saw no school spirit from our
candidates, no desire to represent
and promote the University.

Gallivanting around campus, I
saw numerous posters in hallways,
in the bathrooms and stairwells, on
doors, bus stops and any other piece
of campus ﬂiat could be plastered.

I saw pretty smiles and hand-
some faces on simple posters. Vote

for so-and-so.

I saw colored posters and some 

more original posters with humor-
ous slogans. Vote for so-and-so
because so-and-so drives a station
wagon.

I saw candidates and their
campaign recruits passing out
candy at the student union in an
effort to stimulate everyone’s sweet
tooth. Vote for me because I gave
you some free candy.

I saw recruits passing out little
pieces of paper at the Towers. Vote
for so-and-so because so-and-so is
popular enough and manipulative
enough to have convinced me to
waste my time passing these out.

If the race seems like a self-
serving, self—promoting popularity
contest that is far removed from
pride for Pitt, it is.

Even those involved in the
hoopla of Homecoming admit this.

Pat Keating, who helped out
Jeremy Hancher in his campaign,
was quoted in last Thursday’s issue
of The Pitt News: “It’s how people
know your name and will remem-
ber our candidate.” Why do we
need to know and remember his
name?

Y Candidate Elizabeth Goodrich
was also quoted: “Homecoming is
a chance to not only promote your-
self, but the school and the football
team.” What did she do to promote
the school? How did she promote
the football team?

What did any of the candidates
do to promote the school?

What will the winners,
Heather McNeisch . and Ralph
Dunniehigh, Jr., do to promote the
school now that they have been
crowned Homecoming queen and
king?

Smile and spend more money?

The real candidates for
Homecoming should be those who
show their school spirit through
their actions. They should illustrate
their “pride.”

Unfortunately, the few people I
would have voted for Homecoming
court were not candidates. They are
employees of Institutional
Advancement for Pitt. Thursday,
they spent the morning decorating
the campus with blue-and—gold
streamers and balloons. They trans-
formed Fifth Avenue, Forbes
Avenue, Bigelow Boulevard and
the surrounding areas into a little
city of blue and gold, and it was
beautiful. 1

Nobody asked them to do it.
They simply wanted to share their
own spirit and pride with others.
They wanted to create a feeling of
excitement and inspiration on cam-
pus.

THE PITT NEWS

They succeeded.

When I walked out of the
Cathedral, I felt the excitement, and
I could tell that others began to feel
the excitement too.

. They pointed at the streamers.

I They -smiled when a balloon broke

away and ﬂoated up toward the sky.
They laughed as a two-year—old in a
Pitt T-shirt ran to snatch up a bal-
loon.

The candidates and winners
should playa major role in creating

excitement and pride at this

University, a place where the stu-
dent body has supposedly been
plagued with apathy.

There should be some kind of

qualiﬁcations the students must

have in order to run for
Homecoming court. They should
be involved. They should do some-
thing to prove they have pride.
They should have knowledge about
the University of Pittsburgh and use
that knowledge to show the voters
that they are worthy of the title
“Homecoming king/queen.”

Requiring candidates to have
certain qualiﬁcations would make it
much more of an interesting and
creative campaign process. It
would weed out the candidates who
are in the race only to get the title,
and force the others to think about
why Pitt is important to them.

During this year’s race, the
voters’ decisions were based on the
candidates’ physical attractiveness
and what kind of candy they gave
away.

In next year’s race for
Homecoming court, candidates
should show that they have some-
thing to offer.

Alison Novicki was too busy doing
something constructive for the
University to have had time to hand
out out candy.

Anti-religious attitude hurts the Democratic Party

Michael Berquist
Columnist

As a member of the Democratic Party,
I’ve always been troubled by the hostile
view some of the more liberal members of

. our party take toward members of the

Christian faith. I feel strongly that the ten-
dency these people have to emphasize social
activism as the solution to America’s ills
opened the door for the Republicans to take
over Congress.

Three years ago, after Congressman
Dave McCurdy lost his race for a Senate
seat in Oklahoma, party members in the
state warned the national-party leadership
that McCurdy had lost the election because
of “God, gays and grms.” By making out
mernbersofthereligiousrighttobeabunch
ofcartoonishvillains,tlreythreatentotake
us all down the well-worn path of defeat
again and again They would be wise to
remember a few things about the role that
religion plays in the lives of the American
public.

The Christian faith has been an integral
aspect of Western civilization for centmies,
andtheirnpactreligionhasontheday-to-
day lives of typical Americans is substantial.

. Ninety-four percent of Americans believe in

God, 91 percent identify themselves as

mernbersofareligiousfaith,andaboutlmlf

ofallAmericansprayregular1y. j
Itis anenormous misconceptionthat

religion is a politically
conservative institution.
The Christian church has
traditionally been a bas-

tion of progressive to images of Pat
thought, aninstrument for Robertson’s Christian-
positive change Coalition and other

“Religion in America,”
noted Alexis de
Tocqueville, a young
French‘ intellectual who _
visited America in 1831,
“takes no direct part in the
govemment of society, but must be regarded
as the ﬁrst of their political institutions; for if
itdoesnotimpartatasteforfreedom,itfacil-
itates the use of it”

Churches have founded numerous
schools and hospitals and championed
reforms to make the government more
responsive to the people. Martin E. Marty, a
religious historian ﬁom the llniversity of
Chicago, noted, “The prophetsteach us to
put our religious energies into the homeless,
ourrelativesinneedandthepooringener-
a1‘?!

Two of the most momentous changes in
American society, the abolition of slavery
and the civil-rights movement, were spear-
headed by the church and religious leaders
like the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Religion has been a positive force for help-
ing the disadvantaged, and we would do
welltoseethatitcontinuestobe.

He said

 

It troubles me
when many people think
of religion and politics,
they immediately jump

right-wingers who wish
to press their agenda on
the public by using a
skewed interpretation of
the Bible. I think it is
important to differentiate
between these shysters who seek to promote
their own agenda and to fatten their wallets,
and those who are churehgoers concerned
about the moral state of America.

Also, I have to say that liberals’ insis-
tence that we must spend our resources
ﬁghting to impose our cultural values on
others makes zero sense. When voters went
tothepollsin1996,socialissuesbarelyatal1
registered in the minds of voters. The vast
majority of American voters cared more

about the preservation of Medicare and ,

Medicaidthan strengtheningtheeconomy
andeducation.
BenWattenberg,theauthorofthebook
“Values Matter Most,” has warned
Democrats ofthefallacyofbecorningthe
party of social elitisrrr “When Democrats
openuptheculturalwarfront,theypaya
price. It’s not the Republicans who are
regarded...asthepartyinoppositiontothe

death penalty, praying and Christmas.” The

‘ vast majority of the American public (liber-

al, moderate, conservative) does not like
having its values and beliefs questioned. We
should follow the advice of former
Massachusetts Governor Wﬂharn Weld,
who was booed olf the podium at the 1992
Republican Convention for his belief that
the government should stay out of people’s
bedrooms.

It would be a catastrophic mistake for
Democrats to continue to write off members
of the Christian right as a bunch of zealots
who obey the will of the Christian Coalition.
In the 1996 election, one in every six voters
who ‘ went to the ballot box was a self-
described member of the religious right.

These voters are not mindless zombies
who turn out in droves to vote for
Republicans. Twenty-six percent of reli-
gious-right voters voted’. for President
Clinton in 1996. A CBS/New York Times
poll in July 1994 found that halfof all mem-
bersoftheChristianrightconsiderthem-
selves Democrats.

Instead of ejecting anyone who displays
the slightest bit of independence ﬁorn the
party, as the Republicans do, we should wel-
come these voters with open arms and listen
to what they have to say.

Michael Berquist wants to encourage fellow
Democrats to rethink their misconceptions
about religion and politics.

Students are not at fault for the traffic problems on Bigelow

Jennifer
Stoltz

Pitt students’ and faculty members’
lives are being put at risk every day. What is
it going to take for something to be
changed?

When Bigelow Boulevard was closed
and reopened last year, I was merely visiting
campus and honestly didn’t care much about
it. I was merely passing through. During a
tour of Pitt, we were peacefully and serene-
ly led across the street from the student
union to the Cathedral of Learning, suppos-
edly simulating the typical leisurely stroll
between classes. Needless to say, I was way
off track. _

Later, the road was opened yet again to
traﬂic and to controversy among those
involved Still, the situation didn’t’ tax me
very much. After all, if a driver passes his
test and is on the road, he will obey the law,
stopping at red lights, yielding, and all that
Pedestrians will _ look both ways before
crossing  we all got that message from
“Sesame Street” Everything should run
smoothly, in perfect harmony, right?
Obviously not

When I ﬁrst set foot on Bigelow this fall
asastudent,Ialmostgotrunover.Doinga
double-takellookedatthesignﬂashing
before me. Sure enough, it said “walk.”
Well, that’s what I was going to do_. This

time with at least three students following
the same crosswalk, we were abruptly halt-
edbythe shrillhonkofacarhom. “Where
do you think you’re goin’?” screamed the
driver, sticking his head out of the window. I
just looked at him, bewildered, and kept
walking.

I assessed the situation. The driver had
a red light, we had a “walk” sign, and there
is a crosswalk clearly outlined on the street.
We weren’t jaywalking, and the driver had
seemingly appeared out of nowhere. I could-
n’t ﬁgure it out, so I dismissed it, dodged the
more apparent danger at the time —— pigeons
—— and walked to my class.

But since then, I have learned my way
about, and I now understand the little tricks
of the trade when it comes to street crossing
in Oakland. That is, except for Bigelow.

It’s absolutely infuriating. Every day, I
cross that street, along with tens of thou-
sands of other students. It is located right in
the center of campus, yet it really isn’t a true
partof campus. Itis rightinthe middle of the
heart of Pitt, with the union, the Cathedral,
the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial, and the
Towers in immediate view. All ofthese are
campus landmarks, with even more sur-
roundingthis stretchofroad. Sowhycan’tit
be closed to general traﬂic?

Oakland residents complained at City
Council meetings, stating they didn’t want

to deal with college-age toddlers, or some-

thing to that effect Frankly, I was appalled
by that assessment Did they ever stop to
thinkthatitmightbethemotorists whoare
at least partly at fault?

Granted, there are the occasional care-
less students who just wander in front of traf-
ﬁe. But most of the time, they are hesitant,
waiting a few seconds before sprinting to
safety on the opposite side
of the street. Some even
take campus shuttles to
class, which in many
cases takes much longer,
just to avoid the traﬂic on
Bigelow.

I have seen so many
accidents on Bigelow, and
the vast majority are two-
car crashes. Is it going to
take a string of pedestrian
injuries to make‘ someone
take notice? I certainly hope not. There were
planstonarrowtheroadandtheyfell
through. But, personally, I think that the only
answer is to close the road completely. It’s
needed tomake the campus a continuous
body and most of all, for safety.

. Pitt has been ﬁghting, even trying to
cornpromiseinthis struggle. So far, it hasn’t
won. But it should keep ﬁghting for all the
students, faculty, and visitors who pass
through campus every day. Even though it
doesn’t seem urgent right now, it is. If we

 

give up totally, it is only going to get worse.

People don’t realize how much this is a
problem until they experience the onslaught
for themselves. _I know I didn’t. Any skeptics
reading this should go out and try to get from
the Union to the Cathedral during rush hour.
Actually, just watch someone try to accom-
plish this great feat I guarantee he’ll run for
his life or a car will screech
slowing down. Most like-
ly, A expletives will ﬂow
faster than a babbling
brook.

So tomorrow’s another
day. I’ll get up and go to
class, playing a forced
game of chicken several
times. I dread those cross-
ings. Eventually, someone
will be injured, no matter
how careful he was. On
the other‘ side, giving drivers the beneﬁt of
the doubt, if Bigelow was closed, they
wouldn’t have to dodge students oblivious
to traﬂic. There is something more impor-
tant than my own convenience, or anyone
else’s forthatmatter——Ijusthopethat
things change before someone gets hurt,
before it is too late.

Monday, 22 September 1997

. Carrie
Hager

Surprisingly, the biggest rip—off at Pitt
isn’t the price of the tuition or the price of
on—campus housing. No, not even the
books are the most outrageously priced
item at the University.

Give up? It’s the meal plans. It amazes
me that the University can get away with
such ridiculous prices on a basic necessity
of life. Now, the most logical solution to
the problem of over-priced meal plans
would be to just not get a meal plan, but
unfortunately it’s not a perfect world. If
you want to live on campus, you are
required to have a meal plan -—-— or the
University will assign one to you.

Although there are many problems
with the meal plans, my biggest complaint
is the prices. I’m sure many students share
my sentiments on this issue. I have the sec-
ond-smallest meal plan (B), and I am pay-
ing $900. That is the price for a semester,
not the year. That’s almost $2,000 a year to
eat cafeteria food, which is more than two-
thirds of the price of my room for a year.

With my meal plan, when you add in
the dining dollars, it works out to about
155 meals per semester. Based on a 15.5-
week semester, this works out to 10 meals
per week. A ﬁgure of $900 seems like a bit
much to only get 10 meals per week.

Now, I know there are bigger meal
plans, but I felt like I was already spending
enough money as it was. Ten meals per
week is just not enough to sustain human
life. Who comes up with these meal plans,
anyway?

My meal plan works out to be about
$6 per meal, which seems like an awful lot
of money for cafeteria food. I could eat out
everyday and get groceries far cheaper, not
to mention the fact that the food would be
better. Or I could go to T.G.I.Friday’s and,
depending on what I ordered, eat for the
same price that the University charges for
cafeteria food.

The difference is that Friday’s whole
existence depends on making a proﬁt off

V food. It’s a  good restaurant, one

THE PITT NEWS

A lot more is wrong with the meal plan than just the food

where you don’t mind spending $6 on, din-
ner. The University is notsupposed to be
out to make a proﬁt on food, so why does
it need to charge so much. Doesn’t it make
enough money on tuition? I

Also, the food at Pitt is starchy and
high in fat, and it is deﬁnitely not worth $6
a meal. For what Pitt charges, you would
think you were getting gourmet cuisine,
not cafeteria food. Sometimes I think there
must be a Committee To Overcharge
Students at the University. I can almost
picture a room full of executives sitting
around a large table, thinking of new ways
to raise college costs.

As far as meal plans go, Pitt is much
more expensive than most other state
schools. A friend of mine who goes to
Slippery Rock pays just a little more for a
year than what I pay for a semester of
food, and she gets three meals a day as
opposed to 10 per week.

Another major problem I have
encountered is that there are few places to
eat and limited hours of operation. For the
most part, students seem to eat at Eddie’s,
the Schenley Cafe, or the cafeteria in the
Towers. I

Now, for as many students as have
meal plans, that is just not enough places to
eat. Some days I wait in line for over 20
minutes to get my food, only to find I
might not be able to ﬁnd a place to sit,
which really armoys me. Are fast service
and a place to sit and eat too much to ask
for? It’s not so much that the servers are
slow, there are just too many students wait-
ing for food. There aren’t enough places to
eat and not enough hours of operation.

One Saturday near the beginning of
the semester, I got up around 10:30 and
decided to go get some breakfast, which
seemed like a good idea, seeing as how I
was starving. I went to the cafeteria in the
Towers. Since I was really hungry, I
thought I should go to an all-you-can-eat
place. I

When I got to the cafeteria, I was
shocked to ﬁnd it was closed. (I found out
later that the cafeteria is only open from 11

Jean Marie Zelt/ Graphics Assistant

a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekends.) L

After leaving the cafeteria, I decided
to head on over to Eddie’s. Little did I
know I was in for another disappointment.
I found out that Eddie’s isn’t open at all on
weekends. Needless to say, I was a little
angry at this point and a lot hungrier.

I walked over to Schenley, only to ﬁnd
out that students were packed in there like
sardines. I think half the students with
meal plans were there because it was the
only place that was open.

After ﬁghting my way through hordes
of hungry students while feeling trapped
like a rat in a cage, I ﬁnally made my way
to the register after about 20 minutes. Now,
at this point, all I wanted to do was to sit
down and eat.

That didn’t seem like too much to ask,
but I couldn’t ﬁnd a place to sit and ended
up having to take my food back to my
room, which I was beginning to think I
shouldn’t have left in the ﬁrst place. I just
wanted to pretend this experience had
been a bad dream, but I couldn’t escape
from the reality of it.

Later that same day, when I went to
dinner around 7 p.m., I discovered that
there wasn’t any place open and ended up
going to Wendy’s. Don’t the people in

9

charge of the meal plans think students
need to eat on weekends? When the week-
end rolls around, students don’t suddenly
decide to starve themselves. On weekends,
students should have the same choices
with the same hours as on weekdays. I
think the people in charge of the meal
plans must just enjoy giving students a
hard time.

Also, the way that some of the meal
plans are set up teaches students to be bad
spenders, which is the last thing college
students need to learn, considering the fact
that most of us are thousands of dollars in
debt already. Meal plans D and E allow an
unreal number of meals per week, and
whatever meals are not used at the end of
the week are forfeited.

Because of this, students are unable to
spend their meals carefully. A common
sight Sunday nights at the Schenley Cafe is
hordes of students trying to use up their
last three or four blocks before they are
forfeited. You see countless trays ﬁlled
with 15 bottles of fruit juice or ﬁve per-
sonal pan pizzas, which is not good spend-
ing. College students need to be taught to
be good spenders, not impulsive ones.

As a transfer student, I also found the
lack of useful information to be a problem.
I was sent nothing on how or where I could
use my meal plan until three weeks after
classes started, at which time such infor-
mation was a little too late.

There aren’t many good things to say

about the meal plans other than the fact-

that Eddie’s has good nachos and frozen
yogurt. The meal plans charge way too
much for what you get, there aren’t
enough places to use the meal plans and
not enough hours of service, they train stu-
dents to be bad spenders, and there is a
poor presentation of useful information. I
don’t think reasonably priced food is too
much to ask for, but apparently it is, at least
from the University of Pittsburgh.

Carrie Hager is a sophomore who doesn ’t
think she should have to spend almost
$2,000 a year to eat cafeteria food.

The Pitt News doesn't
take sides, but it should

In your Sept. 11 editorial, you “recommend giving the
custodians and maintenance personnel the same oﬁer that
the University workers received. Pitt’s campus is well-kept;
the workers from Local 29 do a good job here.” The a11icle
then goes on to say: “We also thinkthat ﬂie union members
should not strike. Local 29 should stay on the job and prove
to the University that it deserves the same pay increase.”

One would assume that since the workers do a good
job, they would have already proven they deserve a 
Somehow, though, the workers are supposed to put up with
the situation even longer, to continue to work hard despite

the University’s lack of appreciation,
unfair treatment and outright hostility
toward the union. This is unprincipled
fence-straddling and shallow thinking.

Early in the negotiations, the
University wanted the union members to
take only a 2-percent raise, retroactive to
the beginning of this year (even though
the contract expired in December 1995)
and to pay 15 percent of their health
insurance, which adds up to a pay cut
across the board. The 3-percent raise the union is asking for
is merely a cost-of-living adjustment.

It is true that no one enjoys strikes, least of all the
workers. They do not get paid for the time that they are out,
and they can’t be sure that they’ll get their jobs back unless

they are willing to keep out scabs and
raise awareness among students and the
community. If things were to reach the
point where the University is unwilling to
meet any of the workers’ demands and
the only recourse that the workers have is
to go on strike, what would The Pitt News
do? One must pick sides — there are no
in-betweens. To say that the workers
should not go on strike would be ﬂie
same as taking the University’s side. The

Pitt News should give a clear answer to the question,
“Which side are you on?”

Homecoming
heroics bring
back glory days

Pitt’s win over Miami last
Thursday night meant more than
just another tally in the win column.

It was a triumph of gargantuan
proportions that has taken a good
three days to truly absorb and com-
prehend.

What does it mean to the foot-
ball team?

First, it means the Panthers
showed the country on national
television that they can beat, and at
times dominate, a top-25 team. Oh,
yes, college football is back in the
‘Burgh, and I’m not talking about
Duquesne’s win over Siena on
Saturday.

Second, for the second week in
a row, players made clutch plays

I that they wouldn’t or couldn’t have

made last year:

- The John Jenkins interception to
seal the game. An unbelievably
gutsy play in a man-to-man cover-
age. If he doesn’t make that pick,
Miami probably scores the go-
ahead touchdown.

0 Senior Eric Kasperowicz’s sack
and forced fumble. It was third and
four at the Pitt 5-yard line with
Miami clinging to a 7-6 lead in the
second quarter. Kasperowicz,
whose career has been a disappoint-
ment since his arrival in 1994 as the
Pennsylvania State Player of the
Year, blind-sided Miami quarter-
back Ryan Clement, forcing a fum-
ble that after several near-Pitt
recoveries resulted in a Miami ball.
Miami then had to punt.

° Chiffon Allen’s pass breakup in
man-to-man coverage on a long
Miami pass into the end zoneat the
end of the game. Again, in a man-
to-man defense with under two min-
utes to go. Allen was all alone, it
was his game to lose, but he made
the play.

° Ernest Coakley’s three sacks that
forced three Miami punts. The line-
backer is becoming the star of the
defense. To go along with his three
sacks he had two pass breakups and
nine tackles.

° And of course, I won’t forget the
clutch play of quarterback Pete
Gonzalez, who amazed the entire
universe with his running ability.
His touchdown typified his evening.
He looked for his first, second and

Gonzalez gets Homecoming glory ,

es and the Panthers won a close

This season, Pete Gonzalez start-

Pittsburgh played a Big East oppo-

passes and the Panthers won a close

, A rose by any other name  yeah,

Instead of being pulled in the
fourth quarter in a come-from-‘behind
win versus Temple, Gonzalez led his
renamed, re-emerging Panthers to a

‘ 21-17 victory over 22nd-ranked

Miami. Instead of barely beating the
Big East’s worst, Pitt defeated the
Big East’s best.

Instead of being a near-goat,
“Pistol Pete” became a hero.

“I can’t describe [the feeling],”
said Gonzalez after the contest. “It’s
just a feeling of accomplishment after
ﬁve years of frustration.” .

The fifth-year senior led his

, squad in scoring with three touch-

downs (two in the air, one on the
ground), tied Dwayne Schulters for
the lead in yards-per-carry with 4.8,

Energy, pride and goalpostsz Panther postgame

It was an image of pure beauty. ,

The seconds ticked away, and
thousands of Pitt fans poured onto the
ﬁeld, uprooted the north end zone’s
goal, post and paraded it around the
ﬁeld, chanting, “Let’s Go Pitt!” Police
officers, exhausted football players,
and students joined in a Thursday-night
free-for-all on the worn Astro'I‘urf of
Pitt Stadium.

Looming behind the melee was the
scoreboard: Pitt 21, Miami 17.

Fans were thrilled about upsetting-

Miami, but they were celebrating so
much more: Real college football has
returned to Pitt.

Two weeks ago, when the Panthers
invaded the college football heaven
known as State College, much was said
about the real college-football experi-

ence and the game being played the
way it was meant to be played.

Panther fans voiced their envy (or
hid it) I of the way the entire
Pennsylvania State University united
in support of its team. The visitors were
envious of the tremendous excitement
that made the football game an all-day,
all-students event.

There was a desire for this kind of
excitement -- which, at one time, did
exist in Oakland —— to return once
again. There was reason for hope,
thanks to the strides Athletics Director
Steve Pederson and Head Coach Walt
Harris had made in these early days of
the new athletics regime.

But not even the most optimistic
Panther supporter could have envi-
sioned this kind of success this soon.

“This is absolutely incredible,”
said junior Mike Kosta in the middle of

the postgame celebration. “If you
would have told me a month ago that
Pitt would beat Miami and be three and
one, I would have told you you’re full
of s—t.”

The turnaround is an unexpected
event that has been embraced by the
University. A successful football pro-
gram adds to the school’s image and
adds to the school’s economic well-
being.

More importantly, it’s great for the
fans.

No matter how talent-loaded the
team becomes, even with football
minds like Pederson and Harris, the
athletics program will only go as far as
the fans take it.

Asked about the fans’ reaction,
Harris simply said, “Wow.”

“College football at its ﬁnest,”

There was a petri dish of stu-

money equals bet-

The increase
in funds will also
improve academic facilities, the rest
of the athletic department and stu-
dent life. Just think, with a few
extra bucks, maybe Pitt could end
the crowded conditions in
Sutherland Hall, the grease factor of
Eddie’s pizza and the wasted space
in Forbes Quadrangle.

across the field to Cheo Angel, who
had retreated a few steps from his
wide—receiver position.

Angel looked down field for his
intended receivers on the flea-ﬂicker
pass, but the Hurricanes seemed to
have every eligible receiver covered.

Except one, that is. Angel (the
receiver) fired the ball all the way
across the gridiron, where Gonzalez
(the quarterback) was running a very
slow ﬂare pattern.

Gonzalez caught the ball and took
off down the sideline. He was stopped
after a 23-yard gain, putting the
Panthers just 17 yards away from the
end zone. Pitt scored two plays later.

Add the reception to his 75 yards
rushing, and Gonzalez totaled over
100 yards in total offense before his
quarterbacking duties ever entered in.

“Miami was susceptible to the
quarterback run,” said Gonzalez after
the contest, “and it showed out there
today.”

Head Coach Walt Harris said that
Gonzalez studied ﬁlm of Miami for
hours to reach this conclusion, but it
was a mix of instinct and experience
that led Gonzalez to use the
Hurricanes’ Achilles’ heel for the
Panthers’ ﬁnal score.

Late in the third quarter, after

ball, the Panthers began a drive at the
Hurricane 23-yard line. Two handoffs
to Schulters netted nine yards, and
Gonzalez’s sneak picked up a first
down at the ‘Cane 12.

An incomplete screen to Schulters
set up second and 10 with less than 10
seconds left in the quarter. Gonzalez
dropped back to pass, checked off two
receivers then tucked the ball and
headed for the end zone.

The Hurricanes, spread out in pass
coverage, couldn’t stop him in time.
Gonzalez crossed the goal line, fire-
works shot off, the Homecoming
crowd went crazy, the quarter ended
and Pitt took a 21-14 lead.

Asked about the play, Gonzalez
said that he “wasn’t going to make the
same mistake I made at Penn State,”
referring to his decision to short-arm a

pass from the PSU 5—yard line instead
of taking the ball in himself.

While the 12-yard touchdown
would end Pitt’s scoring, it didn’t end
Pete’s scrambling. After a Miami punt
at 7:16 in the fourth quarter, Pitt’s
offense began what could have been
the game-ending drive.

But, after a quick strike from
Gonzalez to Hoffart resulted in an
early first down, the drive stalled.
Gonzalez overthrew Angel, and
Schulters could only manage three
yards on an up—the-middle plunge. On
third and seven, Gonzalez backed up
to throw.

No one was open, so the quarter-
back started pointing. As he pointed,
blockers seemed to come from
nowhere to demolish those in his path.
A Panther receiver made one last hit

near the sideline, freeing Gonzalez for
a nine—yard scramble and a first down.

Two Schulters rushes later, Pitt
was faced with a third and four.
Gonzalez slid out of the pocket, dodg-
ing tackles for 11 yards and another
first down.

Schulters would fumble on the 10
to give Miami another chance, but a
defensive stop put the ball in
Gonzalez’s hands one last time. It was
then that the quarterback would dam-
age his yards—per-carry average
severely -—~ three straight quarterback
kneels behind the center added up to
minus 4 yards. And a Pittsburgh win.

After the contest, the rushing
average didn’t seem to matter.

“Good things happened to us,”
Gonzalez said, “and we got Miami
tonight.”

VICTORY

Gonzalez made the Hurricanes pay.
Seeing virtually no pressure from Miami’s
front seven, Gonzalez picked apart the
secondary, completing seven of nine pass-
es for 79 yards on the next drive. A 10-
yard touchdown pass to Jake Hoffart
ended the drive. A shovel pass to Dwayne
Schulters for the two-point conversion
gave the Panthers a 14-7 lead, and Pitt
would not trail again.

Pitt’s only other serious threat in the
ﬁrst half was foiled when Chris Ferencik
missed a 24-yard ﬁeld-goal attempt wide
left with 4:23 remaining in the half. Miami
drove the ball back down ﬁeld to Pitt’s 24-
yard line with just over a minute to go in
the half, but another huge third-down
sack, this one by Ernest Coakley, took the
Hurricanes out of ﬁeld-goal range again,
and the score stood at 14-7 at half time.

Having been burned by the Pitt ﬂea-
ﬂicker in the first half, Miami reached into
its bag of tricks early in the second. When
their first drive stalled on Pitt’s 15-yard
line, the Hurricanes lined up for a ﬁeld
goal. Holder Jeff Popovich picked up the
ball and threw a perfect pass to Daniel
Franks in the back of the end zone.

“That’s about as good as you can do
it,” said Harris of the trick play.
“[Popovich] could probably play quarter-
back for them sometime.”

Both offenses took the rest of the third
quarter off, but Pitt’s defense was as sharp
as ever. The coverage by Pitt’s secondary
on Miarni’s receivers was loose in the ﬁrst
half, but tightened up considerably in the
second. After gaining 161 yards passing in
the ﬁrst half, the Hurricanes managed just
96 in the second half.

“We had a couple minor, correctable
mistakes. The coaches addressed that at
half time. We ﬁxed that, and obviously it
worked in the second half,” Jenkins said.

Just like the game a week earlier

Monday, 22 September 1997

against Houston, the Pitt defense contin-
ued to make big plays when it needed
them most. Kasperowicz intercepted a
Clement pass midway through the third
quarter. He returned the ball to Miami ter-
ritory, but the offense was unable to capi-
talize, bungling another ﬁeld- goal attempt.

On the ensuing Hurricane drive,
Curtis McGhee came up with yet another
turnover for the Panthers, forcing a fumble
by Dyral McMillan. The offense made
good on this opportunity. Pete Gonzalez
scrambled 12 yards into the end zone, giv-
ing Pitt a 21-14 lead going into the fourth
quarter.

Miami’s offense came on the ﬁeld to
open the fourth and held the ball for 4: 14,
the longest drive of the game by either
team. The Panthers’ bend—but-don’t-break
defense gave up only a 35-yard Andy

Crosland ﬁeld goal, and Pitt still led 21-

17.

The teams traded punts, and then
Pitt’s offense came back. Still seeing vir-
tually no pressure from the Hurricane
front, Gonzalez and Schulters got Pitt
down to Miarni’s 10-yard line with 3:30 to
go in the game. With a chance to score and
give Pitt a nearly insurmountable 11-point
lead, Schulters fumbled.

“We should have ﬁnished that drive
off. That fumble reminds us that we’re not
quite where we need to be yet. We want to
keep getting better,” Harris said.

With one ﬁnal chance at winning,
Miami drove efficiently down ﬁeld, even
though Pitt’s front seven put consistent
pressure on Clement.

Using the sidelines and their timeouts,
the Hurricanes got to Pitt’s 34-yard line.
On the fourth down, Pitt’s defense had the
biggest play of all, an interception by John
Jenkins. Gonzalez took a knee on three
more plays to run out the remaining 1:12
on the clock.

added the coach. “Believe me, that
helped us. I can’t tell you how much that
helped us.”

Harris praised the fans throughout
his postgame press conference and jok-
ingly brushed off one reporter who
asked him how tough it would be to
practice with just one goal post.

‘‘If we could have ﬁgured out a way
to get it out of the stadium, we would
have taken it all the way down Forbes,”
sophomore Nathan Calhoun said. The
goal post ended up in the stadium stands
after the evening’s festivities concluded.

This property-darnaging enthusiasm
extends beyond the on-the-ﬁeld success
and touches virtually every student, no
matter what their feelings about the
sport itself might be.

' “I don’t know a damn thing about
football,” freshman Jen Shiffman said,
“but it’s exciting. It’s just so much fun.”

It’s this kind of attitude that makes

FROM PAGE 11

that foster great gridiron competition
giving students an excuse to get_out and
interact with their peers.

And, of course, get loaded.

“Miami sucks,” said one obviously
intoxicated young female fan. “They
don’t even know what football is. But
Pitt showed them because we killed
them.”

Yes, her statement makes little
sense. But she was having fun. For the
ﬁrst time in almost every Pitt student’s
collegecareer, football is fun. There is
more to the game than the ﬁnal score;
there is more to Pitt football than Mad
Dog blitzes and buttonhook patterns.

There is togetherness. A

Homecoming game under the lights on
a crisp fall night — it was a storybook
setting, and 40,000 people were there,
together, to see it.

Harris may have said it best:
“There’s nothing greater than college
