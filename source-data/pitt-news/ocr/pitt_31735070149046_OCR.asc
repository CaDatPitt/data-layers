Some area presidents and chan-
cellors, including Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg, hope the pen
is mightier than the sword —— or
the bullet.

In the wake of the Dec. 14
shooting at Sandy Hook Elemen-
tary School in Newtown, Conn.,
college presidents and chancel—.
lors have taken to blogs, arti-
cles and formal letters to open
a public discourse on the issue
of gun control around the coun-
try. Among the letters pleading

for legislative action in regard"

to gun control is an open let-
ter signed by seven area college
presidents and a second letter
supported by Nordenberg.
More than 300 college presi-
dents signed the open letter to
policy leaders asking for gun
safety measures on “behalf of
our children.” The measures
are bullet pointed for emphasis
and include: opposing legisla-
tion that permits guns on col-
lege campuses and within class-
rooms, ending the “gun show
loophole,” which the signers
identify as allowing _the.pur—
chase of guns from unlicensed
sellers without a criminal back.-
ground check, reinstating a ban

Stricker  
outlines

plans for
UHC

Aaron Stier-Cohen
Stqff Wrz'ter

With three semesters of leading
the University Honors College un-
der his belt, Dean Edward Stricker
announced three new initiatives
Friday afternoon during his annual
State of the UHC address.

About 40 Pitt students and
faculty gathered in the Frick Fine
Arts Auditorium to hear Stricker’s
second annual address, which de-
tails the condition of the UHC and
where it is headed.

The University Honors College:

provides classes and research op-
portunities for students seeking a
more rigorous course load. Unlike
many other university honors col-
leges across the country, Pitt’s hon-
ors college grants any student with
a GPA of 3.25 or greater the ability
to enroll in UHC classes and apply
for its research opportunities.

Among Stricker’s new plans
is a faculty mentoring program.
This program will lend students"
an intimate look at research and
ﬁeldwork in a given discipline and
provide a new opportunity for stu-
dents to cultivate relationships
with educators at Pitt.

“Students might shadow fac-_
ulty members to see what it’s like
to be a scientist, academic or an
educator. Talk to faculty directly,”
Stricker said. “I think that’s part of
the education that we provide our
students, and I would encourage

Football players get assault reduced

At/vletes will peiform community service in exc/atmgefor reduction

Cassidy Davis
Staﬁ? Writer

Three of Pitt’s athletes — Ray

Graham, Lafayette Pitts and Devin
Street — who were charged for
simple assault last fall, have re-
cently had their charges reduced

‘ in exchange for performing com-

munity service.

According to their attorney,
Mark Fiorilli, last November they
were each charged with one count
of simple assault and one count
of conspiracy to commit simple
assault. The athletes allegedly sur-
rounded a man in Oakland and one
of them punched the man in the
face. Fiorilli said all of the charges
are misdemeanors.

According to an article pub-
lished previously in The Pitt News,
the athletes were not arrested on
the spot, but instead, received
summonses to appear in court for
a preliminary hearing.

Fiorilli said that after negotiat-
ing with the alleged victim, police
officer and assistant district at—
torney assigned to the case, the
athletes were offered the option

Ray Graham

to reduce their charges.

After completing their com-
munity service, the athletes will
each be guilty of one count of dis-
orderly conduct, which, according
to Fiorilli, is a summary offense.

“After consideringthe time and
expense of a trial in this matter,
Mr. Street, Mr. Pitts and Mr. Gra-
ham made business decisions to
put this matter behind them and
complete community service in

Lafayette Pitts

exchange for a reduction of their
charges,” Fiorilli said.

Their preliminary hearings
were continued up to April 15,
2013, to allow them to perform

community service. Street is re-

quired to complete 40 hours of
community service, while Pitts
and Graham are required to com-
plete 20 hours of community ser-
vice.

Fiorilli said the community

Devin Street

service will becompleted at a
nonproﬁt entity.

5 "‘My clients have declined to
comment on this case as it is still
pending,” Fiorilli said.

 Senior Associate Athletic Di-
rector E] Borghetti said Pitts and 5
Street are still active members of»
the football program at Pitt but
that Graham concluded his col-

legiate athletic eligibility after his 

2012 senior season. I

Nordenberg chose not to sign

a governmental analysis of cur-

Pitt to

students to seek it and faculty to
provide it.”

Stricker said Pitt administra-
tors approved his project Thursday
and that he and his Student Advi-
sory Committee are in the process
of identifying faculty to participate
in the project.

Stricker also said he would like
to introduce a new “Honors Col-
lege Scholar” certiﬁcate by the end
of this academic term.

The certiﬁcate would be a less-
rigorous cousin to the Bachelor of
Philosophy degree the UHC cur-
rently offers, allowing students
who do not have the time to meet
the BPhil’s extensive requirements
to have another way of distinguish-
ing themselves.

“I have two faculty advisory
boards who say this can be imple-
mented quickly,” Stricker said.
“There are some terriﬁc, qualiﬁed
students graduating this year. It
would be sad if they just missed it.”

According to Stricker, such a
certiﬁcate would require a research
paper instead of a thesis, making it
more accessible. Applicants would
also present their work publicly
and to a committee, although not
necessarily to an outside examiner
as the BPhil requires.

Stricker expects this alternative
to draw in students daunted by the
BPhil’s rigorous standards and to
help them realize their potential
for academic research.

Although the program’s non-
membership nature means that
no student is “in the Honors Col-
lege” during his or her time at Pitt,

Edward Stricker, the dean of the University Honors College, delivered his second annual State of’ the
UHC Address, in which he outlined plans for the college. Luv Purohit | Senior Staff Photographer

Stricker said he would like students
who have been active participants
in the college’s classes and pro-
grams to have a way of indicating
their involvement with the UHC
upon graduating.

Lastly, Stricker announced
plans for a board of visitors to pro-
vide an advisory role for the UHC.

“One of the things that im-
pressed me when I was a candi-
date for the dean position was how
impassioned a subgroup of Pitt
alumni were in being interested in

what was happening in the Honors
College,” Stricker said.

Prior to becoming the Honors
College dean, Stricker served as a
researcher and professor in Pitt’s
Neuroscience Department, which
he founded in 1986 and chaired
through 2002. Stricker took over
for interim UHC dean, Steve Hus-
ted, who assumed the position af-
ter the passing of the UHC’s found-
ing dean, Alec “Doc” Stewart, in
August 2011.

According to Stricker, these

alumni attributed much of their
personal growth as undergradu-

ates to the UHC and were looking

for a way to give that experience
to other students.

In the future, Stricker hopes to
harness this passion into aformal
advisory role.

During the address, as Stricker
laid out his vision for the future of
the UHC, two concerned under-
graduate students involved with
the Honors College handed out

leaﬂets to attendees detailing their ‘

qualms with Stricker’s leadership
during his time as dean.

James Simkins, a Pitt senior and
the founder of the group Pitt Hon-
ors College in Exile, composed of
undergraduates disgruntled with
Stricker’s leadership, was one of
the people handing out leaﬂets
before Stricker’s address.

The leaﬂets he passed out ex-
plained his position and that of
the Pitt Honors College in Exile.

“Encouraging students to be-
come creative thinkers is not what
the Honors College is focused on

‘ anymore,” the leaﬂet said. “In—

stead  it is teaching its students
to become better applicants for
prestigious jobs, scholarships and
professional schools.”

Simkins had no great objection
to Stricker’s announcements but
did say that he is in contact with
Pitt alumni who share his concerns
with the UHC’s current direction.

“I hadn’t heard about [the
alumni board],” Simkins said as
the audience ﬁled from the audi-
torium. “But that should be inter-
esting.”

Stricker acknowledged during
his speech that the Honors College
was moving in a new direction. But
he said these changes could fuel
new, positive developments within
the UHC.

“I’ll point out that there are
changes- happening. Speaking gen-
erally, it’s my experience that when
there are changes, that is often in-
vigorating,” Stricker said. “But it’s
also true, I think, that change can
be unsettling. People feel uneasy.
They don’t know what’s happening
next, or they don’t understand why
something is happening. I under-
stand that.” I

times take a middle road on is-
sues,” Dell’Omo said. “This was
one that I felt I needed to take a
stance on. But in today’s society,
ifyou have any opinion, it often
becomes polarizing.”

Currently, 29 college presi-
dents in Pennsylvania have
joined the College Presidents for
Gun Safety in signing the open
letter, including Mary Hines
of Carlow University, Esther
L. Barazzone of Chatham Uni-
versity, Charles J. Dougherty of
Duquesne University, Candace
Introcaso of La Roche College,
Paul Hennigan of Point Park
University, Tori Haring—Smith
of Washington 8: Jefferson Col-
lege and Dell’Omo.

Fedele didn’t comment on the
likelihood of Nordenberg sign-
ing the open letter in the future.

Dell’Omo said he signed two
letters — a general letter im-
mediately following the shoot-
ing and vigil in Newtown and
then the more aggressive letter
drafted by Oglethrope Universi-
ty President Lawrence M. Schall
and Agnes Scott College Presi-
dent Elizabeth Kiss. Before sign-
ing, Dell’Omo said he weighed
his personal feelings on what
he felt comfortable signing with
the public platform he holds as
head of his university.

The letter states that the
group doesn’t oppose gun lead-
ership as a whole, acknowledges
that mental health issues accom-
pany many attacks and resigns
that proper legislation could
not prevent all future murders,

but highlights the group’s disap-
proval of “legislation [that] has
been introduced or passed that
would allow gun possession on
college campuses.”

Dell’Omo said he felt com-
pelled to sign the letter because
it took a specific and tough
stance on the issue of gun con-
trol on college campuses.

“I wanted to attach my name
to that issue,” he said.

According to Renee Vary, di-
rector of university communica-
tions at Oglethrope University,
the letter was initially circulated
through a consortia of private
colleges and universities, in-
cluding Georgia Independent
College Association. The Coun-
cil of Independent Colleges and
the Annapolis Group, comprised

mostly ofsmall to mid—sized schools, also
signed the letter.

Vary said the letter, which was made
public Dec. 19, originally included about
170 signatures and grew to more than 300
in the two days that followed. Signatures
are continually added on a daily basis.

“We had a tight time frame right before
the holidays, so it was never really our
goal to try to reach out to every college in
the country,” she said in an email.

Schall described his motivation to
draft the letter as well as defended the
positions outlined within it through his
online blog.

“I wrote the first draft after watch-
ing the service in Connecticut that eve-
ning. I got into bed and just could not
fall asleep,” he wrote in a post on Dec.
20 titled “Why?”.

Like Dell’Omo, Schall acknowledged
that presidents’ focus on funding has
shifted their involvement in public dis-
course over the years.

“A century ago, college presidents
spoke out all the time on the issues ofthe
day, and sometimes people even listened
to us. But when colleges began to look
more like businesses and so dependent on
money, we collectively retreated,” Schall

said. “I think that’s one reason why all ,

the conversation one reads about higher
education these days is about cost and
student debt.”

Dell’Omo said those who argue against
the presidents’ signing of the letter by
citing the Second Amendment should be
reminded of the First. Asa civil society,
speaking in support of reviewing the
conditions that allow for the harming of
innocent children is not outrageous, he
said, and the worst case scenario would
be the end of the conversation.

“There are clearly many sides to the is-
sue, but right now those four bullet points
[outlined in the open letter] require a
lot more thoughtfulness in terms of how
effective current gun regulations are,”
Dell’Omo said. “I do think we run that
risk ofa two—week discussion that is then
pushed aside.” I

THE STAMATTACK

This building on Fifth Avenue near the Parkway East is slated for demolition. Like the recently demolished

rogress can be a pile of rubble

Lamar Advertising bui|ding,the demolition is necessary for progress. Zach Schaffer | Staff Photographer

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant 0pz'nz'0ns Editor

Today, when taking a bus down-
town, it’s apparent that the eco-
nomic vibrancy of Oakland hasn’t
found its way Uptown.

The neighborhood, crisply
laid out in grids along Forbes and
Fifth avenues, has yet to experience
the redevelopment enjoyed by the
South Side or Lawrenceville. Many
homes are abandoned and others
are in disrepair. Projects such as
the Fifth Avenue School rehabilita-
tion still seem to be the exception
to the general vibe of neglect.

On a macro level, it’s confusing.
If you just look at a map of Pitts-
burgh and guess which area is most
likely to redevelop, the strip of land

' between the state’s second and

third largest centers of economic
activity would be the most logi-
cal place to predict a resurgence.
The historic housing stock and
presence of Duquesne University
and UPMC Mercy Hospital should
make it extra appealing.

But on a micro level, it makes
much more sense why develop-
ment has stalled. Even though Up-
town is perfectly geographically
situated, there are serious psycho-
logical boundaries. Uptown — in
the minds of pedestrians at least —
isn’t really connected to Oakland
at all. The walk from Craft Avenue
to the Birmingham Bridge, while
offering a nice view, is surprisingly
long. Past Carlow University, there
is no sense of continuous urban

fabric whatsoever.

That’s quickly changing, howev-
er, and soon, Uptown might receive
the resurgence it much deserves.

The impetus for this change has
been the demolition of the former
Lamar Advertising Company build-
ing, which, much to the dismay of
some preservationists, was com-
pleted this month.

The building, which boasted
an impressive colonial revival fa-
cade, was like many buildings we
treasure and enjoy in this city. It
had character and a unique adap-
tive history, having been used as a
school, ajewish community center
and, until 2005, the regional head-
quarters for Lamar Advertising.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To The Editor:

My son entered Pitt three
years ago, looking forward to
an exemplary education and the
excitement of Division I sports.
Education is advancing well; his
enjoyment of Division I sports is
waning.

Are the football and basketball

coaches instructing their players
on the philosophy of closing?
Pitt’s teams are terriﬁc and play
at a high level during the “game”
but are unable to close. Review the
past three years and note that too
many games were lost in the last
5—to—10 minutes. i
Football and basketball are
only a game until the last min-

utes. They then become a battle
to be won by the team who knows
how to close. ‘ U

Hire a sports adviser or psy-
chologist to concentrate on how
to close and be a winner. Maybe
it’s a case of fear of winning?

PROFESSIONAL PUPIL

Public speaking in the classroom translates to workplace

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

You’re sitting in class, and the professor is
reviewing the semester’s syllabus. Expec-
tations, homework assignments and tests
are all on the agenda. Without warning, the
professor blurts out the word “class pre-
sentation,” and the room suddenly turns
wide—eyed. It’s as if the word itself ignites
fear, causing students to slink to the very
rear of their chair in discernible discomfort.

Maybe the aura of public presentation
pressure is less dramatic in certain majors,
but the bottom line is that classes that in-
volve oral presentations are far more valu-
able than classes that do not require any type
of oral presentation. I feel this is especially
true for computer science, engineering and

mathematics majors. 

But regardless of major, public pres enta-
tions in a course should be mandatory for
many reasons.

Employers demand that graduates have
excellent written and oral communication
skills. Observing and listening to fellow
students can be an incredibly usefulwayto
learn. You can adjust your own communica—
tion skills by observing what you felt was a

good presentation and what you felt was a
bad presentation.

It’s this healthy form of competition
between your academic peers that will ul-
timately enhance communication with your
future professional colleagues. The competi-
tion doesn’t end in the classroom: Many will
take their talents on display to an interview.
Did that one student do a great job making

eye contact to the audience while he spoke?-

He will probably do so when interviewing
for a j ob. _ ' b

When ﬁghting for sometimes scarce jobs,
knowing the skills of your competition can
help you adjust your own communication to
surpass your peers —— or to at least remain
in competition with them.

Given the value or oral communication, I
am shockedwhen students are notallowed

. the appropriate opportunity to demonstrate .

and learn oral skills through class-presenta-

tions. Real, in-class experience, in addition,

to introducing a competitive atmosphere, is

the only way students can master presenta-A I

tion techniques. . V _
, These techniques, while obvious perhaps,
are not necessarily intuitive. In a study pub-

A lished in thejournal of Computer Sciences in

Colleges, researcher Khaled Alshare found

that students and instructors ultimately
agreed that “well—organized presentation”
and “enjoyable content” were the two most
important measures of presentation effec-
tiveness. - V

Practicing is the only way these skills can
be understood.

In a professional sense, no other facet of
my college career has assisted me as much as
public presentations to peers. This becomes
more evident as I continue my education
post—undergraduate. There are instances
in which having a professional demeanor
and presenting in a professional fashion
have created rich opportunities in my post-
academic career.

I can recall in my information systems
analysis class, we were required to make
two presentations, each about 10 minutes in

length. I had used a piece of software other V

than PowerPoint to share my presentation.

V After class, I had a student praise me for
the presentation style. Only several weeks
h later, I had to present a status report of my
I work’s computer systems. While everyone
V had presented with PowerPoint, I had used a

different type of presentation software. The
change of pace and style was appreciated,
and I received a number of positive com-

ments regarding the job I did. ““

This is not something I would have
learned without having the ability to give
public presentations in class.

Everyone should receive this opportunity.
I will go so far asto‘ say that every student,
whether presenting in a group or not, needs“:
at least 10—to-20 minutes of time with the
class to present. Alshare’s study indicated
that 68 percent of polled undergraduates
thought this was an appropriate length. This
would be a good place to start.

These requirements should also go

- beyond those already in place. Many de-

partments within the Swanson School of
Engineering, for instance, require a pub-
lic speaking or communications class in
order for students to graduate. But this is
not enough: Presentations must occur as
a substantial component of the learning,
process, not as an afterthought.

I always value and accept the opportu-

I nities I have to give a class presentation,
knowing that it’s just as important as any

test. All students should be given as many
chances as possible to help improve their
career prospects through these valuable
exercises. I ’

STAMATAKIS

‘Nobody wants to see buildings like this
go. A city is really only a collection of build-
ings, people and landscape. If you replace a
city’s buildings, you have replaced part of
a city’s soul.

But if Uptown is to ever redevelop, and
if its own collection of historic buildings is
to ever be readapted, the demolition of the
Lamar Advertising building should be viewed
as progress. A little bit of pain today will
hopefully bring signiﬁcant gain tomorrow.

And this is not just for the developers
either.

For one, the Lamar Advertising building
was not an important part of any neighbor-
hood, unlike buildings that incur demoli-

tions inneighborhoods like Manchester or
the West End. These neighborhoods have
seen quantities of housing stock destroyed;

the Industrial Age appeal of the neighbor-

hoods has either been lost or severely cur-
tailed. I — ’

I ‘But this area, called the Oakland Portal
by developers and city planners, was never
really a neighborhood in the way Manchester
or the West End were. Before the demolition
of the building, it stood alone among small
buildings and overgrown parking lots. The
time to save an Industrial Age appeal had

i long since passed.

More importantly perhaps, the building’s
demolition will enable L W Molnar 8: Associ-
ates to begin the construction of new ofﬁce
buildings, which might serve as a true cata-
lyst for spillover growth in Uptown. The new
commerce promised by the development

could help push momentum through the
Birmingham Bridge area into the southern
reaches of Uptown, allowing it no longer
remain a destitute, abandoned region of old
warehouses andmdecaying buildings.

This is great news for anybody interested
in the preservation of historic buildings.

Entropy is always increasing after all. As
years move by, old buildings progressively
become less and less salvageable. Water
damage and vegetation can tear apart the
grandest old homes and businesses.

So anything that pushes redevelopment
forward, even if it is at the cost of one great

-old building, will save other buildings from

inevitable destruction. If this development
can plant seeds for growth, then the Lamar
Advertising building destruction will even-
tually be viewed as a sacriﬁce of sorts — a
tribute that paved the way for the salvation

of many great old buildings that would have
been otherwise condemned. 

That is not to say future building demoli- ’
tions should just be accepted at face value.
The status of the Oakland Portal is unique
to the region: There are few other areas that
are such critical pivot points.

There was no reason to believe demoli-
tions in the West End or Manchester would
drive growth in other areas. This kind of
demolition-as-preservation mentality that
shatters old neighborhoods with missing
teeth has a very small role to play in modern
Pittsburgh.

But for the Oakland Portal to serve as am
catalyst, a little bit of pain was necessary. We
can only hope quickened development in Up-
town and other regions of the city will leave
these types of decisions a relic of the past.

Senior Staff Writer

For a moment Saturday afternoon, Pitt bas-
ketball felt normal.

Normal, meaning the game made little
sense, and the opposition held Pitt down
for 39 minutes.

C’:-I Marquette led Pitt for the previous 37 min-
utes of game time, but Pitt still. had a chance
to win in the waning moments of the contest.

With 1.7 seconds on the clock and Pitt
trailing 57-54, Lamar Patterson caught an
inbounds pass from James Robinson just in

1,  front of the “P” in the center-court Pitt logo
and launched a deep 3—pointer.

Patterson’s shot hit no part of the rim and
splashed through to the bottom of the net
as the crowd at the Petersen Events Center

erupted in cheers.

Unfortunately for Pitt, the overtime pe-
riod held no excitement for Panther fans
as Marquette (12-3, 3-0 Big East) scored 17
points in ﬁve minutes to take a74~67 victory
over the Panthers (13-4, Big East 1-3) back
to Milwaukee.

The Golden Eagles knocked down 13 of
16 free throws in the extra period.

Marquette’s 13 successful free-throw at-
tempts in overtime coincidentally matched
the number that the Panthers hit through
the duration of the game.

The Panthers shot 13-for-26 from the
charity stripe, a 50 percent mark that will
long stand as one of the reasons Pitt dropped
its second consecutive Big East home game.

“If we would have made half of our [missed
free throws], I’m sure we would’ve won the
game,” Patterson said. Patterson tied for the

game-high point total with 22 — also a career
high — and knocked down a career-high six
3-pointers.

Also of misfortune for Pitt was a collision
that occurred early in the ﬁrst half, which
resulted in senior point guard Tray Woodall
crashing to the ﬂoor, holding his eye. After
being taken to the locker room, medical staff
diagnosed Woodall with a concussion, thus,
removing him from the rest of the game and
for a certain period of time afterward in order
to go through the process set in place for
concussions, head coach Jamie Dixon said
after the game.

Dixon’s Marquette counterpart, Buzz
Williams, believed Woodall’s exit from the
game changed a lot of what Pitt wanted to
do Saturday.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt extends
conference
losing streak

Dave Uhrmacher
Stcyff Wrz'ter

' The Pitt women’s basketball team squandered

an opportunity to break a 19~game losing
streak against Big East teams Saturday, los-
ing at home to the Villanova Wildcats, 68-52.

In the Panthers’ ﬁnal regular season match-
up with their in-state rival as members of
the Big East, Pitt was unable to contain the
Wildcat offense in the second half, becoming
outscored 35-21.

In Pitt’s ﬁrst home contest in 23 days, the 5

Panthers (9-6, 0-2 Big East) struggled to con-
tain the Villanova 3-point attack, a problem
that has plagued Pitt defenders all season long.
The Wildcats (13—2, 3-0 Big East) drained nine
of their 27 3-point attempts.

Pitt headed into the locker room at half-
time only down 33-31, led by eightpoints from
redshirt freshman guard Loliya Briggs.

“Our mindset was just to keep playing
hard,” sophomore guard Briarma Kiesel said.
“We knew we were going to get caught on

defense a few times, but we started to pick it .

up and run our offense and do the things we
needed to do.”

But the Wildcats then came out and quickly
sank ﬁve shots from behind the arc to start
the second half, which set the tone for the
rest of the game.

After the game, Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato said that stretch of hot shooting
from the visitors made the difference in the
game.

“We knew coming in they were going to
make [~3—pointers], and at the beginning of the
second half, the ﬁve threes they made really
did us in,” coach Berenato said. “They have
284 straight games with a three. Our goal was
to really overcompensate for the three and try
to defend their unorthodox offense.”

Villanova guard Rachel Roberts went 3-for-
6 from beyond the arc, ﬁnishing as one of two
Wildcats in double ﬁgures with 14 total points.

Junior forward Asia Logan scored a game-
high 21 points for the Panthers, shooting 10-
of-16 from the ﬁeld. Kiesel was the only other
Panther in double digits, recording 11 points
and a team—high four rebounds. ,

Kiesel wastaken for a scan immediately
following the game because of a pinky ﬁnger
injury she sustained in the second half. The di-
agnosis revealed no fractures, only a strained
ligament, which should not keep Kiesel from

RDGER THAT

Next four games will prove decisive for struggling Panthers

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team has four

A games to save its season.

After losing an overtime heartbreaker
Saturday at the Petersen Events Center
against Marquette University , which
dropped the Panthers to 1-3 in Big East
play, Pitt is entering the dangerous ter-
ritory of playing itself out of contention
for the NCAA Tournament for the second
consecutive season.

But fortunately for head coach Jamie
Dixon’s team, the next four games on the
Pitt schedule offer the chance to build up
some momentum before the Panthers en-
ter their most difficult stretch of games.

Beginning with an away game against
an average Villanova team on Wednes-
day, Pitt must immediately begin gaining
ground in the conference standings. After
playing the Wildcats, the Panthers will
host Connecticut on Saturday, Jan. 19,
travel to Providence College on Tuesday,
Jan. 22 and return home to play DePaul
on Saturday, Jan. 26.

None of those four teams were pro-
jected to ﬁnish ahead of Pitt in the Big
East Preseason Coaches’ Poll, meaning
the Panthers are essentially playing less
talented teams for the next two weeks.

While every Pitt fan knows this Uni-
versity’s athletic teams have a history of
losing to teams that they shouldn’t, that
stigma needs to change now for Pitt men’s
basketball.

In last year’s nightmare Big East cam-
paign, the Panthers let losses to com-
petitive teams, such as Notre Dame and
Cincinnati, spiral into defeats to lesser
teams, such as DePaul, that Pitt had no
right losing to. a

With the wounds of early setbacks

has the opportunity in the next four
games to overcome adversity and get
back to .500 in conference play.

And the Panthers need to get back on
track before it’s too late.

Pitt won’t want to enter impending
matchups with No. 4 Louisville, No. 7

ing that it just lost to”"lowly teams like

’ “I."think ‘losing Woodall changed the ‘I

complexion of that team,” Marquette’s head
coach said.

With Woodall out, the prime responsibil-
ity to run the offense fell on the shoulders of
freshman point guardjames Robinson. And
against the Golden Eagles’ zone defense,

Pitt’s only weapon proved to be the 3-point -.

shooting of Lamar Patterson.

“They had a good defensive scheme to-
night,” Robinson said. “I think we could have
executed our plays a little bit better,_been a
little bit more crisp on our execution. We just
didn’t get it done.” ’ ' « v ., I I *-

Robinson was one of the other two players
to score in double ﬁgures, with 12 points on
4-for-11 shooting. Redshirt freshman forward
Durandjohnson scored 10 points himself off
the bench but in an ineﬁicientmanner akin-to
Robinson, ﬁnishing 3—for§1_o from the ﬁeld.

Overall, Pitt’s offense ﬁnished the day
under the 40 —perc_ent rate  usually a
benchmark for afidecent shooting day — at
39.7 percent, ending up 23—for—58 from the
ﬁeld. Meanwhile, Marquette made the same
number of shots but on 10 less opportunities,
resulting in an excellent clip of 47.9—percent
shooting. _

Another contributing factor to Pitt’s loss
Saturday — and a recurring theme in Pitt’s
four losses so far — is the inability to make
the necessary plays at their respective neces-
sary times, as Patterson described.

“We just gotta get down and make sure
that when we need a stop, we get a stop. When
we need rebounds, we gotta make sure we get
the rebounds,” Patterson said. “Whenever
we needed a big play, we just didn’t come

  
 
       

people will point tothe free throws,’_’ Dix-
on saidi ‘f_I‘think you can point out a lot of
things?’  3  i‘ '

Coach Dixon admitted his team’s 13
missed foul shots probably altered the out-
come of the game. .

“When you donit make free throws and
not make layups, you’re, not goingto get the

_ success you want,” Dixon said. “Obviously

you want to make free throws, obviously
we want to go inside. Weigotpfouled, we got

. For the third tirn conference play,
Pitt was ou-t—rebouAn’_d «=¥its.op‘p‘osition.
Marquette ﬁnished the ante :with;a'p_l-us-
ﬁve advantage onvthegglass, pullingviﬁ 38
rebounds to Pitt’s 33. Di_xon.also noted that
after offensive rebounds‘, Pitt didn-’t ﬁnish
put—back attempts, which you “have to do
against the zone.”

“We’ve lost three games in the league
and got out-rebounded in all three of them,
so that shows,” Dixon said. “I point to the
rebounding. It usually comes down to that
for me.”

Defensively, Dixon also cited that the Pan-
thers did a poor job of keeping the Golden
Eagles “in front,” and Marquette’s 61-percent
rate from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst half was a direct
derivative of the inability to do so.

-Now the Panthers need to ﬁnd a way to
start winning games and “getting it done”
~— as nearly every Panther said after the
game —— beginning with Pitt’s next game at
Villanova on Wednesday at 7 p.m.

For Dixon, it will start with two speciﬁc
aspects of his ’team’s game. ‘

“We need to_ grov_ijr,’up;quickly and ﬁgure
