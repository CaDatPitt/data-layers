MES, i_M_itchell Tens croup
At Receptiori Of” Recent
European Journey

Seventeen nations were-represented
at the annual-. reception -of .the,Na-
tionality Committees, calledlast night
in Memorial Hall by Dr. John Gab-
bert Bowman,_chancellor of the Uni-
versity. Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell,
adviser of the nationality rooms of
the C-_athedra,l~,, spoke on»-iinpressions
of her recent European tour.

Mrs. Mitchell’s purpose-din’ _making.

the trip was threefold, she explained
to the audience, She consulted with
ten foreigni architects to‘ exp.._e',dite
building plans . for ‘the Cathedral

Raise Living Standard

“A 1: over _ce’ntral -Europe, ‘people
were e;ndeavoring“to rajisetheir stan-
dard -' of livillg%’:’:“"sl1e' tleclared.' “Ce-

mentﬁhigl1ways,’steel buildings, telc-.

phonic construction, and education are
being developed with astonishing ra-
pidity. In certain spots in Lithuania,
for example, homes receive .t_he news
of the .world through radios equipped
with , crude -a.eria'ls ma_de_ of ' tree
branches. Broad roads, obviously built
for military ‘purposes, ‘are »used by
the peasants to haul produce to mar-
ket."

Mrs. Mitchell stated tl1at'*‘_‘war
talk” is much more prevalent in the
United States than in Central Eu-
rope. “The people are _t_horou.ghly con-
vinced that war is a silly and use-
less metliod to settle disputes,” she
commented. “They are too busy with
their 2 building program to worry
much about it.” i " ‘ - .

Traveled 14,000 Miles _ __

All told, Mrs;...,Mitc_h_ell estimates
that she traveled a distance of 14,-
000 miles, passing through 14 coun-
tries and working in ten of them.
Her German and French, admittedly
“very; ragged,” were suﬁicient to en-
able her to consult with committees
and architects. . ,

At last night's meeting, committees
represented the countries ’ of China,
Czechoslovakia, France,

uania, Norway, Poland, Rouma_ni'a,
Russia, Scotland,Sweden, Syria and
Yugoslavia. . -'

Phipps Conservatory Offers
Instruction On Flowers

Graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents in the biology department now
have the opportunity to learn how to
cut plants to the best advantage for
the plant, to learn how to arrange
ﬂowers at a flower show, and to learn
why a certain arrangement is best
for the beneﬁt of the ﬂower.

A special class in ﬂoriculturc is
being given this year in Phipps Con-
servatory under the direction of A.
F. DeWerth, horticultural consultant
of the conservatory. Mr. DcWcrth was
selected by the Pittsburgll Parks and
Playgrounds Association to act as hor-
ticultural consultant _, -for the Pitts-
burgh parks. I

Laboratory work tllat can be ap-
plied to practical usage, is ollcred.
In-the laboratories the students are
taught the techniques for all meth-
ods of propagation of plants in green-
houses as well as outdoors. Tliey are
taught how to cut stems properly and
insert them in the ground so that
the shoots will become iirmly imbed-
ded.

Insects and their relation to plant
diseases and the control. of_these dis-
eases make up one ])ll:.l.<C‘. of the
course. Fertilizers, their constituents

and application, are another phase.

Members At Dance

Military Ball Date
Set By Committee
For Early March

Military Ball dates are hoodooed.
Last year the well-advertised St. Pat-
rick's Day ﬂood postponed the dance
for a month. This year it seems that
everyone has a different idea about
when the affair should be held. Ac-
cording to Wednesday’s Pitt News,
the ball is scheduled for the 12th
of April, and all t-he time the com-
mittee has been under the impres-
sion that it was supposed to be on
March 12.

But now the paper and the com-
mittee have conferred and decided
that March 12 sounds like a good
time to dance to the smooth rhythms
of Eddie Duchin and Charles Pallos
down (or up) on the 17th floor of
the William Penn Hotel.

Not content with booking the
year’s biggest name band, the ROTC
department has decided to go exclu-
sive and limit admission to their an-
nual aﬁair.

Traditionally the biggest dance on
the school calendar, the ball t-his year
w-ill be limited to 850 invited couples.
Military men will receive the first in-
vitations. These and three dollars,
the price of each ticket, will be hon-
ored until March 5, but after that
date no tickets may be purchased on
the basis of these first bids.

Non-military students of the Uni-
versity will then receive invitations.
The second lot of bids will be issued
through campus organizations, and
will be. good until the day of the
dance, March 12. _ ‘

There will be a meeting of all
members of the Military Ball com-
mittee today in the Military Office
at 2 o’clock.

SFA L Committee
Names Co-Heads

Hardy, Bearer Will’ Direct
Spring. Festival Week

 

 

SFA’s executive committee have se-
lected Kathryn Hardy, C37, and Louis
Bearer, ChE37, to co-direct the
Spring Festival Week festivities, ac-
cording to William Schenck, BA,
chairman of the SFA executive com-
mittee. They will hold sway over the
celebration a11d games to be held from
May 5 to May 8.

Two heads of Spring Festival have
never previously been appointed. The
usual procedure has been to appoint
a male chairman and a co-ed who
controlled the special women's events.

Bearer is a_ member of Scabbard
and Blade, Omicron Delta Kappa, the
YMCA cabinet, and head of the stu-
dent cheering block which made its
appearance this year. Miss Hardy,
president of Zeta Tau Alpha, woman’s
social fraternity, is a member of the
Senior Court, Mortar Board, and
Xylon, honorary journalistic frater-
nity for women.

The executive committee also se-
lected William McQuade, CE37, as
chairman of the SFA peace commit-
tee. The chairman of the senior
announcements committee will be
elected next week.

Dr. Boyce Speaks

 

Dr. Joseph C. Boyce, Department
of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, will give an illustrated
lecture on the Harvard M-it-Eclipse
Expedition to Central Soviet Asia, to-
morrow evening at 8:15 p. m. in the
Lecture Hall, Carnegie Museum. Fac-
ulty and students are cordially in-
vited. No admission. .

 

!Dr. Geise, Graham Honored

By Sophomore Activity
Group Wednesday

 

No students were tapped to
Druids Wednesday.

First - semester SO-pl10i110l“€“;S
who had ﬂocked to the dance
at which the ta’;-ping  to
take place found that the honorary
activities fraternity has passed over
their petitions in favor of two fac-
ulty men, Dr. John J.  and Mr.
Robert X. Graham.

Dr. Gcise is assistant professor of

history and faculty adviser to Druids.
Mr. Graham is instructor in jour-
nalism and adviser to University pub-
lications.
L Leonard Levison, C39, president of
the sophomore organization, explain-
ing this departure from precedent
(faculty members have been tapped
to Druids but always in conjunction
with student recognition), said:

“We are attemptinjg to put into
force the Druid regulations which
always have been rigid. This is no
new policy. We feit that the first-
semester sophomores are not of suf-
ﬁc-iently outstanding calibre to merit
Druid recognition.”

The two faculty tappees, who had
been persuaded to come by friends on
onepretext or another, were more
astonished than the overlooked stu-
dents. Said Dr. Geise:

“This was certainly a surprise to
me. I knew the Druids at State where
the organization was founded and I
am sure the l-ocal chapter is uphold-
ing its traditions.”

Mr. Graham was not  loss for a
statement :

“Since this is my second year at
the University, I suppose I. really am
a sophomore, but I hardly expected
this honor.”

In line with the traditions r-el'erred
to by Dr. Geise, the University chap-
ter of Druids is active making prep-
arations for a convention for colle-
giate Druid chapters. The conclave
will meet in Pittsburgh in March, at
which time plans for the national
organization will be ‘discussed. The
locally sponsored affair will be the
first Druids convention in many years.

Sidney Tumpson, C39, has been
appointed chairman of the conventi-on.

Radioes To Amateur

Leonard Silver, C39, Picks Up Returning Student’s Call

From Station W320X On

‘Caliban’ In Mid-Atlantic;

Caller Wants Tickets For ‘A Square Peg’

By Irving Bennett

_ A message from far out in the At-
lantic Ocean was brought to the
parents of a University graduate by
another student last Thursday eve-
ning, when one of the army of radio
“hams” who worked day and night in
the recent ﬂood again proved his
worth.

Leonard Silver, C39, who operates
an amateur station in the attic of his
home in Edgewood, was on duty late
Thursday evening. He twisted the
dial of his set, listening for the fa-
miliar “Calling CQ, calling CQl”

He heard a faint sputter through
his earphones. A message was com-
ing in. _ Silver tuned in. Faintly the
call came through. “Pittsburgh.
Pittsburg .” “WSLOX Pittsburgh.
WSLOX Pittsburgh calling,” Silver
answered. ' ‘

“Hello W8LOX. W32OX aboard
freighter Caliban, Atlantic liner ship.”
Back went »Silver’s response to the
ship in the Atlantic. In a minute
the message was coming in. “WSLOX.
Harold Riefer aboard the “Caliban,”
2,500 miles out of London, calling.
Am Pitt student. Tell my parents-
tell my parents, 1.132 Grafton.Drive,
I will be home February 20. Hello.”

“Go ahead W32OX,” Silver sent
back. “I'm a Pitt student, too.” For
a minute Silver says he lost contact
with the Caliban. ‘Then the ship radio
faded in.. "Glad to know you.
.W8LOX. Have to see you some time.
Can you give Chuck Foreman a mes-
sage for me? Tell him I heard his
next show is coming off soon. Read

it in a paper mailed to me. Save me
a seat.” For several minutes the two
talked, Riefer pumping questions
through space about things he wanted
to know.

Riefer, Silver discovered, is a for-
mer Pitt Players actor, who was
graduated in 1934. Last November
he left as radio operator aboard the
Caliban and has been on the seas
since them. Early this month his
father mailed him a copy of the Pitt
News in which a. story on the next
Pitt Players’ show was included.

When Silver gave the message he
had received to Riefer’s parents, they
expressed surprise that their son
would be home soon. He had not
been expected in Pittsburgh until
later.

Silver calls his receiving the mes-
sage sheer luck. “Only once in many
thousands of times could such direct
contact‘ be made,” he commented.
“Here was a ship 500 miles at sea,
calling a city about 700 miles away
and getting it ﬁrs't.oi_f. Whoo!"

Box iOIlice Appeal

Editor, The Pitt News:

HILE WE ARE wondering just what the

boys are concocting for the 16tl1 annual
Cap and Gown production, it might not be a bad
time to call time out, and introduce a few new
angles or ankles for the eggzecs to ponder. ’Ihc
current show might do well to go after talent
that has deﬁnite “color” or appeal.

F’rinstance, there’s those Rose Bowl chain-
pions a’1yin’ idle for a short time. Why_ not do
a bit of recruiting, and give the show a triple-
threat punch, something that_the customers will
pay ‘tosee. We wager they will even cry “More’
on opening night, if given a chance to hear that
Californey Sunshine tenor of Mr. _"Curly” Steb-
bins, the gent whom you all will recall showed
up with a’ bit of a truckin’ act to punchout that
stunning early Qhio State power from the cham-
pionship scene early last fall. Crooning and
trucking do not make bad company. Ben Bernie
and"Los-Angeles liked it during the New Year
Reces‘s.'.- Night ~ clubbing Trocaderos, Brown
Derbyites, and-Cocoan-ut Grovers didn-’-t think it
washalf bad.  _ 

And ..that_ is only theibeginning of an-athletic
skit that.would make the promoters ease up on
the hair—t_earing act along about the middle of the
first night. B‘ulky—A,rnold Green, quarterback,
fullback, and_ not a bad hand at Corn Husking
(ask Nebraska), can do tricks with a guitar when
he wraps 220 pounds about that insignilicaiit
gang of strings. That's only the_ beginning, for
we ‘could go on to give you a glowing report of
a Delich-Hensley dance combinatioii that is ..
downright."nasty.” We guarantee that this 420
pounds of truckin’, swing-oii-dowii duo would
throw the customers right out into those fine-
carpetcd Nixon aisles. And they woiildn’t be
heading for the exits, either. Hensley di(ln’t
do a bad job of showing up Husky johnny Wia-
track, the west coast’s outstanding center, during
that New Year’s afternoon siesta. Remember?

It wasn’t long ago that Joe Torniey, varsity
football center, was doing some good for the
box office sales. Then there were -others before’
that who set some sort of records; That gentle:.
man is now holding down a seat in the Hollywood
family. ..

Of course, we aren’t suggesting that Cap and
Gown needs funds. But it still wou1dn’t’be a bad
idea. . . . "
Sincerely yours,

as :8 =5:  C. L. M.

Political. Whirll

By William Stark

MONDAY evening, Dr. Ralph J. Watkins, director

of the Bureau _of Business Research, delivered a
paper._ Under ordinary conditions a bare ai'ii.iouncc-
ment in metropolitan newspapers would have SUlIl('.€‘.(l.
But the condit-ions of the deliverance of this paper were
not ordinary. The occasion was a dinner ‘given by the
Maurice and Laura Ealk Foundation, and 'tlic guests
were 400 of the‘ outstanding industrialists, educators,
and businessmen of Pittsburgh. Dr. Watkins’ paper
presented a summary of the findings of it rcscarcli iii-
vcstigation conducted by the Bureau.

The study was written by Dr. Carroll R, Daiigherty,
professor of economics at the University; Dr. Melvin G.
de Chazeau, of the University of Virginia, and Dr.
Samuel S. Stratton, of Harvard'U-niveisity. Dr. Wat-
kins edited the study, which was ﬁnanced by the Falk
Foundation and the Brookings Institution.

The report concerns itself, in the main, with condi-
tions caused by the NRA, and its effect on the iron and
steel industry. “The fundamental weakness of the
Code,” the report says,_ “is discovered in the alniost un-
restrained grant of power to the industry to regulate
its own affairs.-” V. p -

The study goes on to show how “secret” price ﬁxing
operates within the industry itself, saying that “condi-
tions of free competition do not exist and could"not
be imposed on the industry.” In other words, a few
leaders in the iron and steel industry are enjoying a
virtual monopoly under which the few independent op-
erators are forced to follow the standards setibytlie
leaders._ Predetermined agreements are frequently em-
ployed in price ﬁxing, the study shows. Although the
authors of the study do not recommend unrestricted
price competition in the iron and steel industry, they
do suggest that the fundamental problem is “how to
curb those monopoly elements necessary for eﬂiciency
and _how to afford the maximum protection from the po
tential evils associated with monopoly.”

With regard to collective bargaining, the study shows
the ‘failure of craft unions to take advantage of oppor-
‘tuniti'es’pﬁ."ered by the NRA to organize workers into

outside independent uiiioiis. ’I‘he report emphasizes
that “evidence shows conclusively that the great major-
ity of employe-representative plans were favored and
fostered by the companies in order to forestall outside
unionization.”

The section on labor sets down certain principles.
They are:

First, steelworkers should be organized. Scc‘6iicl;.the
logic of the industry’s operation is such that vertical
rather_than craft organiza'tion is called for. ’l‘liird,
collective bargaining should be on a national basis
rather than on a plant basis. Fourth, orga.ni'zatioii of
stmlworkers should be-~in accord with the principles of
industrial democracy, under which the workers are ac-
corded the unrestrained exercise of expression and par-
ticipation in measures affecting their welfare.

Probalily the most 's‘pectacv.ilar
project backed by the Student

Facility Association was our first,

the Footliall De-inonsti-ations Block,

directed by Louis Beaver, E37.

Using almost 1,000 students, the

Block, through its organized cheer-

ing and color" displays, attracted

widespread attention and favor-
able coininciit. For the first time
the average student was given the
opportunity to participate in the
color and activity of a" Football"aft-

errioon. ,

from similar high school organiza-

in the future.

The request for a course in sex

cl'.i.~<s will meet for six weeks or more
and subsequently report on the ad-
visability of establisliiiig a permanent
course in this ﬁeld.

The Social Committee, a. stand-
ing committee, has met weekly,
and ‘worked hard not only in its
own field of social activities but in
branch lines that have fallen to its
lot. The Appointments Committee
has interviewed all applicants for
major committee cliairrriariships
and has chosen well. This program

for such appointments has secured _

the

given all students a chance. .
The Executive Committee has as-

sponsorship of all the committees
and has endeavored to drive the

trying to institute student dental ex-
aiiiinations similar to our student

from week to week the Student Fac-
