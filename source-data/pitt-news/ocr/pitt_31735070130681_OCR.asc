A “I was barely conscious during the eye test [to deter-

"Ihe pain above my eye was excruciating and the nurse
had to keep propping my head up because I couldn’t do
it myself.” v

She was not given any drugs since 7 am, yet that

' . Maybe taking all of Pitt’s trash, dumping it in Schenley
Quadrangle and sifting through it for recyclables would
make students cognizant of how much more they could
recycle. ‘ . , '" 

r But until Pitt’s administration buys into that ‘idea —é

' already present at Johns Hopkins University —— thousands of .

green recycling bins will have to do the trick.

The 3,860 bins, which ‘were recently delivered to Pitt
thanks to Student Government Board’s environmental com-
mittee and_ new Recycling Coordinator Mike Brennan, are
slated to go into campus dorm rooms. V

' “We’re meeting [with Residence Life] tomorrow to talk
about how to distribute the bins and make students more

, aware of Pitt’s efforts to recycle,”;said‘ Lauren Burkert,'the

SGB’s environmental committee chair. Until a decision is
made, the bins will remain-in storage. P _ ,_
Currently, Pitt’s recycling efforts are limited to bins in

‘ the lobbies of residence halls.

“The problem is that if any other type of material is put
into the bin, the contents are contaminated,” Burkert said".
“And that means they can’t be recycled.”

What does manage to stay pure ends up in the hands of

Habitat for Humanity. The group takes Pitt’s recyclables to ‘

a Pittsburgh facility and uses the money to build houses in

'-the area. 5

“Recycling has been prominent for almost 20 years,”
said SGB member Shahrooz Bhopti. “But only in the last
few has there really been a resurgence in the efforts.”

Though the new green bins may be cumbersome, -the

» group has also worked with food services to hand out yellow

plastic mugs —— good‘ for 10 percent off a drink purchase at
campus dining facilities. _ ’
Burkert, committee member Jay Ver and others recently
attended a conference at Duquesne University about envi—‘
ronmental issues at Pennsylvania schools.
Burkert spoke at the conference about the committee’s

activities during Earth Week last year, which included edu~

cation about contamination and a hike in Schenley Park.‘

‘While the committee is only a year old "— Burkert_

helped form it early‘ last year — it does have big plans for

V Pitt and Oakland.’

“We’d like to get these bins out into the residence halls

- first,” Ver said. .“T hen move on to the fraternities. After that,

we’d like to make sure the Oakland community has a solid
recycling program in place.”

The environmental committee, along with SGB’s com-
munity relations committee and Student Volunteer Outreach
will be cleaning up Oakland ‘on Oct. 14 as part of the
Pittsburgh Project." _ . '

. ‘Students will form groups of about 20 and be assigned
to" clean up a specific part of Oakland. There will also be a

, speaker to discuss environmental "issues and recycling on
V campus. Last year about 600 students collected garbage in

Staff Writer

I A crowd of mostly over-30 listeners
gathered in Benedum Hall Wednesday
night to listen to established journalist

and CNN ' commentator Robert Novak

speak about his news experience and
political‘ideologies. »
Sponsored by the Honors College

’ and the Graduate School for Public and ,

lntemational Affairs, Novak spoke as a

part of the “American Experience” lec- .

ture series. ' V » V »
Drawing from more than 40 years
of jdumalistic experience, Novak com-

mented on the evolution of politics \

throughout his career and what he per-

ceives are the major issues of this year’s"

election. ‘ v ‘

The white-haired Novak, clad in‘ a
black three—piece suit and tie, explained
that he gained the nickname “the prince
of darkness” during__ his career in
Washington. He said this was perhaps
dueto his tendency to “[move] even fur-

. therto the right in a left-wing communi-

’ 99 ,
. 

But despite his conservative poli-

» tics, Novakicautioned his audience that

he did ‘not hope to “bash” Al Gore,

rather to look rationally at the election at

hand.
Novak said that in the course of his

political career, he has covered 11 pres-

idential campaigns as well as 22 nation-
al conventions. He said hehas discov-
ered three things common to all elec-

S » tions and used these to guide his speech.

He joked that the public always asks

itself, “Are these the best two candi-
’ dates we could come up with?” and pro-
ceeded to poke fun at the Democratic _

and Republican parties and the methods

they have used in choosing their presi-

dential candidates. ‘ S
The bulk» of Novak’s speech con-

, cerned the second; guiding question,"
. ‘*What’s the difference between these

two candidates?” Novak commented on
the major issues surroundingthis year’s

campaign as well as" to critique ‘Tuesday

night’s presidential-debates.

- Novak addressed the issue of the
government surplus expected in the next
decade. 2 '

“The real debate is whether the
money will be spent on new govem-_
ment programs or fewer taxes,” he said.

* Novak also touched on issues which
he was surprised the candidates had dis-

_ cussed in their «debate, including social

security and education. Novak said that
for the first time in his political career he
saw" presidential candidates discussing
social security, something  which he
feels -has always been a taboo political
topic.  v .

He was also surprised to see.educa- ‘ 1

tion debated. N ovak joked that he keeps
a copy of the Constitution on hisnight-
stand for when he can’t sleep at night.
Hesaid he ‘has never been able to find
anything in the Constitution concerning
the federal govemment’s role in educa-
tion, “not even in invisible ink.”

In Novak’s opinion‘, issues the can-

didates should be debating include tax
- reform, racial quotas, and school vouch-

ers. _
‘ . “We. ‘need a different [tax] system,

S but nobody wants to talk about that,” he

said. a ’ V _
To close his speech, Novak mocked
his third observationiof the line common
to all national conventions; “My fellow
Americans, this is the most important
election of your life.” , _ .
Novak assured the audience that
regardless of the outcome of the election
they will be ‘,‘safe,” explaining-that the

checks and balances present in our gov- -

ernrnental system prolong the approval
Of all legislature. ‘ H ‘

Novak’s conservative opinions con- ..

tinued to guide his remarks, and he con-
tinued to stress the importance of less
government. He said his favorite presi-
dents were Ronald Reagan and Calvin

R Coolidge, two presidents of. the same

political philosophy.
”“The "power of the presidency is
what bothers me,” Novak said, “not the

‘people they ichoose ‘to. serve  the . '

office.” ~

The Pitt News regrets the errors.

When fans ﬁled into Three Rivers

‘arrived at the stadium three hours

before game time to claim a seat she

other ‘students in ' surrounding rows

were told leave. . .

rude and told us. to get out,” Alicata
said. f‘When we asked where we should

Imagine getting free subscriptions to

Playboy Magazine. Pitt senior Lee Stein

doesn’t have to imagine; he’s been work-
ing as a Playboy representative since his
freshman year and that’ s exactly what he
gets. ' , _ .
T “I was surﬁng the Web one day.and
saw that Playboy was looking for college

', representatives,” Stein said. “I saw an ~

In the years Stein has worked for

Playboy, there hasn’t been much activity '

Occasionally he passes out surveys, which
give Playboy information fortheir college

' articles.‘

:Other than that it’s been quiet on the
Playboy front. But all that changed a few
weeks ago when Stein discovered that
Playboy is holding a campus photo contest.

The magazine is looking for pictures
of college students doing wild and crazy
things in Playboy T-shirts. The contest is

. open to men and women» over 18 who are

registered college students.

  on-campus Playboys

Stein said that it has been frustrating
trying to‘ get word out about the contest.

"He is not allowed to hang any ﬂyers in
the residence halls, since they weren’t
approved by Residence Life. People have
asked Stein if the ‘contest is a pictorial’
search for the magazine. According to him,
the contest is far from the usual Playboy

l notion of nudity.

‘‘It’s to show normal college students

having fun with their ﬁierids onzcampus,” V

Stein said. ‘ V

Playboy will allow nudity in the pho— '
tos but neither encourages nor discourages ‘

it. The magazine suggests taking pictures
in ﬁ:ont of school landmarks. The photos

will be judged on their originality, sexiness A

and school spirit.

“Playboy wants to see college students ‘ , P

having fun,” Stein said. - A

Six winners will be chosen in the 1

nationwide contest, who will each receive

a a classic black Playboy T—shirt. -Their pho— _ l

tos will also be posted on Playboy’s Web

l Stein will provide T—shirts to anyone

“Even though this is only a day,
we’d like to keep something like it

going on a regular basis,” Ver said. “So

maybe we can keep Oakland looking
good.”

The presidential elections this year
are also inﬂuencing the environmental
comrr1ittee’s actions. The group plans
to collect information about candi-
dates’ stances on environmental issues
to help educate students.

. Burkert said while voter registra-'
tion is very important, students_ must

also be educated on the issues.

“One of the top three issues for
young people this year is environmen-
tal concerns,” Burkert said. “We’d like

to make people more conscious about
recycling and show them that there’s a
direct connection between what they
do and [a Habitat for Humanity house].

The committee also hopes to con-
tinue running its Can Test contest along
with Habitat for Humanity. The contest
allows student groups to collect their
aluminum cans and have them sent to a
recycling facility. The group that col-
lects the largest number of cans
receives a portion of the aluminufn
value. The rest goes to Habitat for
Humanity. .

Burkert said that education is -the
key to a‘ successful program at Pitt, and
the freshman are place to start educat-
ing, and keep the torch burning.

“We need to make sure that [recy-

cling] keeps up at Pitt for years to

come,” she said.

Create your own fall breakby

tMonday is Columbus Day. By

I ‘ 01’ Chris wasnot all he was original-

ly cracked up to be.’ He exploited the
natives of North America and then

gained fame for “discovering” the I

land that they already inhabited. The

. fool thought he was on the other side

of the world, in India, and left behind
a legacy of inaccurately referring to

_Native Americans as Indians. In

short, Columbus bites. _
' However,‘we’re willing to tem-
porarily ignore this, since Monday is

- a national holiday in his honor.’

Holidays are good. Banks and gov-
ernment operations‘ such as post
ofﬁces take the day off.- Some col-
ileges even recognize it as a holiday.

‘ .. Pitt, obviously, does not, despite the

fact‘ that Columbus Day falls around
what would be an extremely fortu-

l' . itous time for a fall break.

break, it is only rational that students
create one of their own». This is as

Violent Nike commercial is outrageous

While watching the recent Olympic games,
Ijwas extremely shocked to see a Nike commer-
cial promoting violence. This commercial,
showing a woman wearing Nike sneakers being
chased by a man in a hockey mask, saddened me

' because it made me realize how low some com-

panies go just to sell their product. While I
watched the commercial, I wondered if Nike

partnered with the producers. of the “Friday the

13th” movies just to boost its sales.
In case you have never heard of “Friday the

13th,” it is a gory series of movies that I watched"

in the 1980s. In these movies, a maniac wearing
a hockey mask and carrying a chain saw slaugh-
ters women as he chases them. Unfortrmately, it
is mostly women who fall victim to Jason’s
bloody rampage. ,

' Because viewers thrived on violence, it was

9 not enough’ for the producers to make just one
' movie, they made six sequels. Sadly, in the

1980s I supported those producers by watching
a few _of the sequels. Looking back, I cannot
imagine how I managed to watch those bloody
movies that exploited men as well as women.

' Even if Nike feels this is the age where
graphics and sensation are the way to reach

' viewers, it is playing off of a bloody movie.
9 Though the commercial doesn’t say anything

explicitly about the characters, people who have
seen the sequels can equate the character chasing
the woman to_ Jason. :

. One good thing Nike did was" show the
woman escaping from the person wearing the
mask; the message the company wants to send is
that their shoes can help people escape from

I _ maniacs. Although this may be a clever idea, it is
‘ in poor taste to use this script to entice viewers to
buy Nike. ’ .

In real life, wearing Nike shoes will not save
a person if a maniac or multiple maniacs go on a
bloody rampage — we need look no further than

-the Columbine shootings, where many high
‘ school students and a «teacher were killed. Did

Nike ﬁnd out if any of them were wearing their
shoes? Even if they were wearing Nike shoes,
they did not have a chance to run from the
“Trench Coat Maﬁa," as the killers were labeled.
If Nike made a realistic commercial about this

event, all the viewers would have seen is blood
being splattered all over. the place.

‘It is just mind-boggling that, after all the
violence to which childrenvhave been subjected
to in schools and in the streets, Nike would still
air this commercial. Making sales should not be
the ultimate goal when the methods used include
violence and‘ exploitation.

The guy with the mask chasing the woman
through the woods with a chain saw is nothing
but exploitation of that woman. Yes, the woman
chose:to be in the commercial, but just because
many people do a lot of things for money it still
is not right. ' ’

If children who wear Nike shoes are
attacked on the streets because other children
who don’t have them want them, will Nike take
the blame? Of coursenot! They are not willing
to take the blame if people kill for their shoes,
but are however willing to air a sick commercial
portraying a person can live because of their
shoes.

Nike made the commercial, but they are not

solely responsible for airing the violence since

the stations carrying the Olympics gave them the
air time. ‘ C‘

‘ Television stations get a lot of money from
ads, but are certain ads worth airing when they
degrade the sanctity of life? It would have been
wonderful if the stations never aired the com-
mercial, but unforttmately they did.

The good thing to know is that, because of I

people’s reactions to that commercial‘, some sta-

.tions decided to stop airing it. This decision is

something that takes a lot of guts, and I applaud
those stations for it, as they showed a lot of class
caring more about how viewers reacted to a vio-

lent commercial than about their wallets. lf Nike :
cares for children, they should think twice before

airing another commercial of this nature. If they
continue to do so, we should boycott Nike prod-
ucts for the sake of both children and society.

important things in life than making a buck,
especially speaking out against evil, as Christ,

Confrontingithe ?‘real world”: reflections of a senior

Everyone says that entering your senior «

year makes you feel old and makes you con-
front the reality of going out and facing the
“real worl .” '

Well I have a few things to say about the
theories of what it’s like to be a senior.

I want to state thatl don’t really feel any
older than I was last year or even the year
before. People like to say they feel old so that
they can feel superior to all the younger per}
ple around them. However, I don’t want to
feel old —- I enjoy being able to act like I’m

0 12 years old and, unforttmately, I’ll only be

able to get away with it for "another few
months. I don’t really understand why
becoming old is so- popular anyway. If I
could, I’d try this whole 20s thing a bit

longer.
Anyway, enough about being _old —

.1ets move on to the other parts of the senior

theory.

As far as going out into the real world is
concerned, I have but one question: where is
this so-called real world? And if what I’m
living is not the real world, then what have I
been doing allthis time? I personally think
the real world (or at least what people like to
term the “real world,” which seems to be the
boring life of working from 9 am to 5. p.m.
every day‘ until they wheel you out in a box)
is a bit unintelligent By that I do not mean
the people in it are unintelligent but that the
system itself is unintelligent ' '

I say, however, that I did not waste one
penny of my college education, for these
four years have taught me hundreds of dif-
ferent ways to think of the world and people
around me. Being at this University has
taught me how to work hard
and make the most of myself,
and has also pushed me to the
limit and shown me that it is

how to deal with problems I never even
thought could exist before I came here.
There are, I’m sure, many things I could
do when I graduate. For example, I’ve
always thought being a “repo” man. would
be 0001 since you get to knock down. peo-

- ,ple’s doors and take back all of their ﬂiings.

The bad part about this one is that they usu-
ally don’t want to give those things back
Another thought I’ve had was going to

0 law school, but Pin not sure how many more

years of studying I can take. Besides, I feel

like I should use the degree I’ve gotten here. i
-I’ve always thought having my own televi-
sion show would be cool, but I’m/ not really . '

sure how you break into that ﬁeld —_ if you
know anyone, please let me know.

_ I’ ve also thought about being a doctor a) a
- because it’s cool to have people call you doc-

tor and b) because you can actually do some

_ positive things with your life. But, once: »
‘ again, the downside of this is the amount of
_ time it takes to accomplish.

Although ‘those are just a few of my

S ideas, the list goes on and it would get a bit
I’ boring for me to continue.

Okay, so what’s the point of  ram-

. bling? A few things.‘ First, enjoy your time

here while you can. Get loud and obnoxious

_ as often as possible, and when you miss

you can imagine. 1 .
‘ Second, stop worrying about what you-

are going to do when you leave here. Asglong A A

KENNETH PAUL

Senior Staff Writer

Saturday, Pitt travels to the
Carrier Dome to square off against
Big East Conference foe, Syracuse.

Syracuse comes into the game
with an unimpressive 2-2 record,
while Pitt -takes a 4-0 record into the
matchup. '

The Orangemen are a team with

talent but to this point, they are very"

inconsistent.

This is Pitt’s best opportunity in
years to_ defeat Syracuse at the
Carrier Dome, a feat that it hasn’t
accomplished since 1982.

The strength of Syracuse’s team
is its running game. The running
attack, which is ranked 14th nation’-A
ally, is guided by junior James‘
Mungro and senior Dee Brown.

The duo has accounted for 608‘

of Syracuse’s 878 total yards on .the ’

_ ground. Mungro is averaging 8.8
yards per carry while Brown is aver-
aging 5.1. '

The Orangemen started the sea— —

son off with an easy 63-7 romping of
Buffalo. 1

After the easy op.ener, the
Orangemen ran into trouble when

they visited an improved Cincinnati
club. Syracuse lost the game, 12-10,
after turning» the ball over three
times. Turnovers have been the
team’s Achilles heel all season.

A week after losing to
Cincinnati, sophomore quarterback
Troy Nunes threw two interceptions

against East Carolina. The young.

quarterback threw five interceptions
in Syracuse’s first three games.
Syracuse’s defensive backfield

was exposed in the East Carolina.’

game as well. ECU quarterback

David _ Gerrard threw touchdown

passes of 33, 46 and 68 yards. ,
This is an aspect of Saturday’s

game that Syracuse coach Paul“

Pasqualoni (109-48-1 overall record
at Syracuse) is concerned about.

In his press conference this
week, he noted that he "Was con-
cerned about Pitt receivers Latef
Grim and Antonio Bryant. Grim has

caught“ a touchdown pass against.

Syracuse in each ofithe, last three
seasons. ,

Syracuse evened up its record‘

last week with a breakout game at
home against Brigham Young, win-
ning 42-14. _ ‘

of assurance,” Viancourt‘ 7 said.
“When everyone *b_e1i_eves in you and
gives you words of‘ encouragement,
it helps you to know you have some
100 teammates pulling foryou.”

“You know, that saying ‘Count
on me in ?83’ meantva lot today,”
Fazio said afterward. “We used many
players today who filled the role of
being counted on when the opportu-
nity Vcame.” ’

“Here’s a guy who is a walk-on

y./,.

and kicks it when we really need it,”
tailback Joe McCall said. “That’s
what makes our team so great.”

Obvious1y'Viancourt made the.
biggest impression. After, Snuffyg
Everett, Schubert’s initial replace-
ment, missed two second-half field
goals, both within the 30-yard chalk
mark, Fazio had seen all he" had to
and gave ‘Viancourt the confident
nod. A . l —

“It was tough for Snuffyto miss

them,ibut that’s the way it goes,”_
Fazio said. - ~ 3 T
For Viancourt’s part, he stood
purposefully,. almost solemnly,
before the tee, performing a custom-
ary sign of the cross before a deliri-
ous stand-up throng of people. ,
1 “You have to be nervous,” he
said in his soft-spoken style. “As
much as you block out the nervous-
ness, there’s always a certain amount
of fear involved.” ‘

last yeai, it did so with a sloppy
offense and suspect defense. The
Orangemen scored a touchdown on
a ﬂubbed field-goal snap. -

— Mistakes such «as that are the dif-
ference between a 4-0 Pitt team and
a 4-0 Virginia Tech team. The
Panthers escaped Rutgers after turn-
ing the ball over a ridiculous seven
times. The Hokies definition of
escape is when Michael Vick\does-
n’t produce 11 touchdowns.

Syracuse and Pitt are stuck in
similar spots right now, a tier

beneath Miami and Virginia Tech

and a tier above Rutgers. The rest is
a crapshoot. ’

Pittsburgh-area Nunes, a Butler
High School graduate, could have a
game like he did last year when he
led a Syracuse attack that threw for
threﬁ touchdowns despite only 118
yards in the air. The Orangemen ran
45 times for 187 yards That’s noth-
ing special, considering Mungro
averages 8.8 yards’ per carry this
season.

Joining SU and Pitt in that class
are Boston College, Temple and
West Virginia, teams searching for
identities and positions within the
hierarchy of the conference. Each
can finish anywhere fromithird to

seventh, and each team’s fate
depends on how they fare against
their mid-level peers.

The Panthers’ troubles have
begun and their seasons have fal-
tered because of such teams. They
could have beaten Syracuse last year
behind a. strong second-half show-
ing. But nudging out such victories
seems horribly difficult for such a
consistently average team.

It’s asthough 5-6_is Pitt’s break-
ing point. The last bowl the team
appeared in: the John Hancock Bowl
in 1991. The last bowl the Panthers
won: the Bluebonnet Bowl, the
freakin’ Bluebonnet Bowl in 1989!

More than a decade separated
from its last truly meaningful win,
Pitt middles in the muck, eternally a
.500 or worse team. Now has its
chance to get a big victory, to beat
someone other than Bowling Green
or Kentor Rutgers.

Embarassingly, the Panthers
won’t do it at home because, well,
they don’t have a home. We really
liked Pitt Stadium. OK, so maybe
we didn’t, but its o1d—time lore earns
it respect. - .

Oilers poised ifo

Wednesday’s 2-2 tie between the

_’Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche
was a great beginning to the NHL

season, withfew question marks,

“ injuries and scandals to mar it.

Things have gotten tougher as

-far as predicting winners, shown in»

large by my selection of the New
York Rangers a year ago to win the

L Stanley Cup. .

I should have known it wasn’t
going to pan out after hearing it from

a fellow student at a fraternity party.»

“Who’s the‘ dumbass that picked

' the Rangers?” the fraternity brother

asked.
That would be me, but I won’t
make the same mistake this year.
Even with Mark Messier back,

-‘the Rangers will not win the Cup.

I’m not going to leave you hanging,

however, I’ll tell you who the victor.

will be. Not now, though.

In the Eastern Conference, New
Jersey, the returning Stanley Cup
champions, will have a tough time
repeating as most champions did in
the 1990s, because of free agency
and league parity.

The Atlantic Division should be
won by the team that forces the oth-
ers to play its style of hockey.

The Devils and the Philadelphia

Flyers are the favorites, with the
Pittsburgh Penguins and New York

Rangers following behind. ,
The Devils are in a similar situa-

tion as they were after they won the

Stanley Cup in 1995. .

The team lost Claude Lemieux
then, and lost him again this year to
free agency. ’ 

i The Devils did not spend any
money in the offseason by acquiring
free agents, so the loss of Lemieux
could make this team worse.

John LeClair, a winger for the
Flyers, had to go to salary arbitration
because the Flyers would not pay the
perennial 50-goal scorer what he
wanted. That may prove costly to
Flyers general manager Bobby
Clarke. . ~ ’

The Flyers mixed in quality
youngsters Brian Boucher and

Simon Gagne last year and with,

LeClair, Mark Recchi, and Eric
Desjardins, the team should be Cup
contenders. -

,_ The Southeast Division would
have been the worst division in the
NHL if not for the addition of the

Columbus Blue Jackets to the
Western Confer_ence’s ‘ Central
Division.

Pavel Bure’.s Florida‘ Panthers
and the Washington Capitals will
compete for the division title, but

GREATEST FROM 10

"Ironically, Pitt, a 17-point
favorite, inﬂicted anything but
nerves into the underdog

Orangemen. Both teams remained
deadlocked, l0-10, once Syracuse
quarterback Mike Christodulu hit-
wide out Mike Siano with a 22-yard
scoring strike just two and a half
minutes before halftime.

Pitt started its first drive of the
second half with good field position

at its own 48, butwas forced to settle '

for a three—point attempt when» an

illegal receiver was spotted, giving  9 _
iraccolades w,as,Congen1i, the one who

the Panthers fourth—and-10 from

Syracuse’s 12; 
Everett’s, attempt died several

feet short of the crossbar. '

After their next drive’ started off 
1 with a 10-yard holding ‘call and
ended with a punt, the. Panthers:

reeled off 14 plays on their following

series, were hit with a five—ya-rd ille--;;_ "

gal procedure penalty and again wen
into field goal formation. .1

This time, Everett’s attempt ha
the distance but was wide of the left
upright.’

Meanwhile, Pitt’s defense played _
jto the perfection of tradition.

Syracuse never stepped "into Pitt ter-
ritory for the entire half except when
the Orangemen went for a punt on
fourth-and—2 from Pitt’s 47. ‘

, Defensive end Al Wenglikowski
started the half off in fitting fashion,

sacking Christodulu for a 13-yard ‘
, loss. Syracuse’s next drive concluded

when tackle B-ill» Maas stepped over

anything in his way and smothered .

Todd Norley —— in for several downs
after Christodulu bruised his left hip

’ on ‘an earlier—executed option.

A Both linemen later notched
another sack, giving the offense the
ball for another shot at -adding to its
10-point output. With’ the two failed
field goals behind it, the John

Congemi-led -brigade had trouble’

producing another scoring chance.
One drive soured when Congemi
was sacked for a seven-yard loss.
Another traveled all of 12 yards after
starting from Pitt’s .15. And yet

» another, from Syracuse’s 19, went

down the tubes when a potential
touchdown pass to tailback Chuck

' Scales was intercepted.

“I wasn’t-surprised that Syracuse‘
played as tough as it did,” said
Congemi, who-passed for 194 yards,
completing 20 of 39 attempts. »

“I didn’t think it would be this’
close, and it wasn’t as close as the
scoreboard indicated because we had
so many opportunities to score.”

The final one emerged when line-

‘ backer Troy Benson intercepted 1 a~

Christodulu misfiring at the Syracuse
46 and headed for the sidelines to
drown the clock’s progress.

' “[Christodulu] just sort of rolled ,

A-.-_--< - " -* ‘mus-as:

out,” Benson said. “I, dropped into
my zone and Maas was putting pres-
sure on him. He didn’t see his receiv-
er, I caught the ball and said ‘I better
get out of bounds.’ “ .

That set up’. Viancourt’s heroic
effort and ended two fruitless quar-
ters.

_ “Another guy on defense gave
up, but we said ‘nothing doing’ and
we didn’t,” Benson said. “The inter-

ception didn’t mean anything, but

with the field goal, it made me hap-

-pier.f’.’;  g ~ 

-' _‘‘Ii 0 -sjust happy to see. Pat make
l_t."'.’   .
Another who passed on similar

held centef Tony Magnelli’s snap
during the field goal.
“Iwas feeling the, pressure [Pat]

was feeling,” Congemi said. “I
haven’t' been holding for him’ for
about four or five weeks; I just want-
ed to catch the ball and get my fin-
gers out of the way.”

That’s because Viancourt is left-
footed and Congemi is more accus-

tomed to the right—fo‘oted Schubert.

- “Pat was as calm as ever,”
Congemi continued. “He came out
and put his tee down, which is what
is usually done —— you just leave it
where it falls and don’t move it.”

“But he put it down, was getting
ready, and then he picked it up. After
that, I concentrated on just three
things: getting the ball, putting it
down, and getting my fingers out of
the way.” .

“Then he put it through.” .

The crucial conversion salvaged

a decent first-half performance by
the Pitt_ offense that ended its initial
drive when a misguided Congemi
-pass fell into linebacker Tony
Romano’s hands.

“I wasn’t happy with my perfor-
mance,” Congemi offered. “When I
threw the interception, it was scary
since you never want to give good
field position and momentum to the
enemy team.”

The enemy team sped to a 3-0

lead with 1:45 left in the first quarter, ‘

compliments of a 24-yard field goal.

Congemi then ‘wasted no _time
arousing a dormant offense, capping
a 12-play, 80-yard drive when he hit
split end Bill Wallace on a 25-yard
sideline fly pattern with 4:05 left in

It was the first game that Nunes
did not throw an interception. Nunes
completed 22-of—44 passes for 272
yards.

Mungro carried the ball 11 times
for 119 yards. He had a touchdown
run of 20 yards and another for 61.

Syracuse’s top receiver, Pat
Woodcock, had two catches for 143
yards versus BYU. Both catches
went for touchdowns, one at 79
yards and the other was for 64 yards.

Syracuse scored all of its points
against BYU in the first half.

For Pitt to win, the defensive
line must continue to play well and
put pressure on.Nunes. Pitt’s defen-
sive ends, Bryan Knight and Ryan

/‘ '

Smith, must also be able to contain
Mungro and Brown.

Nunes has a history of getting
rattled if he is hurried. Also, the fans
at the Carrier Dome have been quick
to boo Nunes, as of late. If Pitt can
get him shaken early, the Syracuse
faithful may turn into its allies.

Pitt’s secondary will have to stop‘

Woodcock. Look for safety Ramon
Walker to give cornerbacks William
Ferguson, Shawn Robinson and
Shawntae Spencer help over the top.

On the offensive side of the ball,
John Turman will once again be the
starting quarterback for Pitt.
However, head coach Walt Harris
has made it clear that both David
Priestley and Rod Rutherford will
also get time at quarterback.

The offensive line will have its

hands full as Syracuse’s front four
are not the biggest, but are very ath-
letic. A
The key to Pitt running the ball
andprotecting-the quarterback is to
contain defensive ends
Pettijohn (6-2, 259) and Dwight
Freeney (6-2, 246)._ Freeney had 2
1/2 sacks against BYU last week and
Pettijohn has collected 17 sacks in
his first three years of play.

Outside linebacker Morlon
Greenwood must be watched at all
times, too.

Another key to the game for Pitt
is to get Bryant and Grim the ball

often. Grim is still looking for his

first touchdown reception of the sea-
son. - .
