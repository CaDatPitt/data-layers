Conflict
of Interest
Policy curbs

Abbey Reigard

Mary Glazer believes it would be unfair
for a professor to write a textbook, as-
sign that textbook to a class and receive
royalties from the books sold to Pitt
students.

“My roommate was really angry be-
cause she had a professor who assigned
a book that she had to pay $200 for, and
it was a 50—page book,” said Glazer, a
freshman rehabilitation sciences major.
“She thought that her professor was sell-
ing the book and reaping the profits.”

But to Glazer’s avail, Pitt has poli-
cies in place to ensure these conflicts
of interest are dealt with accordingly.

The Conflict of Interest Policy, insti-
tuted in 2008, prevents professors from
earning royalties oneself—auth'ored books
sold to Pitt students —¥ even students
who don’t have that faculty member
for class.

John Gareis, a communications pro-
fessor and director of undergraduate
advising, and Ellen Cohn, associate
dean for instructor development, have

Adjunct professors seek better compensation

Raechelle Landers

Professors in the Pittsburgh area are
working to change the system within
which non—tenure-stream faculty mem-
bers work. i _

“It’s not that costly to properly pay
your faculty,” Robin Sowards, adjunct
professor of English at_Duquesne Uni-

WTISBURGH

 

‘versity and Pitt, said.

Sowards is the coordinator fo-r
the Adjunct Faculty Association, a
group formed by adjunct professors
at Duquesne in September 2012. It is
affiliated with United Steelworkers, a
labor union, and aims to support the
rights of non—tenure—track academic
faculty in Pittsburgh.

“The long-term goal is the removal

of the two—tiered faculty system,” So-
wards said.

According to the University’s bylaws,
Pitt currently operates a system that
allows only professors and associate
professors to qualify for tenure, which
requires about seven years of work at
the University. Even after seven years,

co—authored and published two edi-
tions of “Communication as Culture:
An Introduction to the Communication
Process.” V I
Gareis and Cohn published the first
edition of the book in December 2007,
shortly before the Conﬂict of Interest
Policy came into effect at Pitt. The sec-
ond edition was published in April-2013.

Because Gereis and Cohn did not‘

require students to purchase the text-
book until .2008, after the policy was
put in place, they never received royal-
ties from the sale of their work to Pitt
students for either of their books.
According to Gareis, he and Cohn

made arrangements with their publish- ‘

ers to ensure they didn’t receive royal-
ties from the books Pitt students pur-
chased. The publishersjwould charge
Pittlstudents a discounted price with
the royalties deducted.

Gareis believes that the policy was
introduced in order to “safeguard‘stu-
dents” from having to cover the cost of
royalties from their professors’ book
sales.

“Instructors ‘have a captive audi-
ence,” Gareissaid. “For [book royal-
ties] to beneﬁt me, to be a portion of
my livelihood, that’s where the conflict
of interest lies.”

Cohn said that she fully supports the
Conflict of Interest Policy. ‘ -

She said the policy has not discour-
aged her from writing books. According
to Cohn, it is the contribution that her
books have in the classroom, and not
the prospect of royalties, thatmotivates
her to publish books. _

A “I don’t believe that faculty members
should collect royalties from their own
students,” Cohn said. “Dr. Gareis and I
have "always taken a proactive approach
with our book [by] insisting on a price
reduction for our students.”

Jerome Rosenberg, chair of the‘
Conflict of Interest Committee at Pitt,
said that when University faculty mem-
bers publish their works, they usually
ask their publisher to omit royalties
through the University Book Center or
through whatever vendor they choose
to sell their material.

If the publisher drops the faculty au-
th0r’s royalties, students can purchase
their books for a price lower than the
one including/the royalties.

Rosenberg said he usually advises
authors who cannot convince a pub-
lisher to drop royalty costs and reduce
the price for books sold to Pitt students
to compute the earned royalties and

. contribute that amount to a fund ben-
. efiting Pitt students.

According to Rosenberg, if the roy-
alties are not withheld from the sales
price or donated to a fund beneﬁcial to
Pitt students, the conﬂict of interest
would then be handled by the faculty
member’s University department.

’ If a conﬂict of interest concerning

the sale of material written by faculty

arises, the academic department‘ of the
author in question handles the conse-
quences, Rosenberg said. I
Rosenberg said faculty members did
not resist the changes to the policy con-
cerning royalties. '

“I do not know of any complaints or 4

any backlash,” Rosenberg said. .'

In 2004, Rosenberg oversaw the
merging o_f the Conflict of Interest
Committee with the Oversight Entre-
preneurial Committee. Both commit-
tees formed in the 1990s and dealt with
conﬂicts of interest regarding research
and intellectual property. .

The committee has 25 voting mem-

bers and three ad hoc members from
the Office of General Counsel of Pitt,
UPMC and the Office of Technology
Management.‘  ,- g  . l
The members” of the committee con-

. sist of one member from the community

unaffiliated with Pitt,'a student recom-
mended by the Graduate and Profes-
sional Students ‘Association and two
members fromjvarious administrative

the president of the University Senate.

Each member typically serves a three- . ‘

year term. -I _
Johnny Lee, a sophomore chemistry
major, said that he wasaware of the
policy at Pitt. He saidlhe previously had

to purchase. , r _ V
Lee said that he is indifferent toward
the policy because he does not believe

it affects him personally.

Curtis Bucher, a senior-natural sci-A
ences major, believes the policy nega-
tively affects Pitt students and faculty.

a professor may be denied tenure. But
once a professor achieves tenure, it be-
comes difficult to dismiss him or her,
giving them a high level of job security.

Tenured faculty at Pitt earn annual
salaries that range from’$45,000 to
$130,000 according to a 2011-2012
report by the American Association
of University Professors. Tenure is
granted to senioracademic faculty
and ensures that they will not be fired
without just cause.

A non-tenure-stream faculty mem-

ber usually serves one or more one-year

contracts before they are eligible for a
three-year contract. To earn a three-
year contract, the adjunct professor
orlecturer must maintain a detailed
portfolio including OMET evaluations,
grade distribution reports, non—class-
room activity and a faculty vote in their
favor. ’
According to Sowards, changing this

type of system will guarantee students '
more access to their professors because’

adjunct professors often hold similar

, contracts and positions with multiple

universities in order to supplement
their income and'd’0 not have ﬂexible
availability or proper ofﬁce spaces.
“It’s unreasonable that such a large
proportion of the faculty aren’t sup-

ported,” Sowards said. “People need

to be paid properly.”

- Ken Service, Pitt’s vice chancellor for
communications, said the University
values all of its faculty and is -working
to address the issues raisedby non-

-tenure-stream faculty.

Service said the Office of the Pro-
vost is .currently working with an ad
hoc committee of the University Senate
examining issues related to adjunct and
non-tenure-stream faculty.

_ Robin Clarke, a-contracted lecturer
at Pitt, said adjunct professors in the
English department m-ake $2,900 to
$4,000 per semester per class.

“This is kind of the University’s dirty
secret, and I think if parents knew what

the teachers were making in compari- . ,

son to how mu_ch they’re paying in tu-
ition, they’d be upset,” Clarke said.‘ '

Clarke has a three-year contract to
teach in the English.department, but
she also’ lacks the security and income
of tenure. "

“I make $31,000 a year to teach six
classes,” Clarke said. . .

Daniel Kovalik, senior counsel of
United Steelworkers and an adjunct

professor at Pitt’s School of Law, said.

most adjunct professors-are living on

' Kovalik said. '. V -

and job security for adjunct faculty.

“People who are adjuncts often work
at more than one school, so you want

Clarke was encouraged by the re-

junct faculty pay andjob security. She

Pitt. The committee members include
both tenure and non—tenure—stream
faculty from various departments and
schools within the University.

“Although Pitt does quite well in
terms of providing medical beneﬁts
and has better working conditions than
many schools, there are many other
issues, that relate to further improving
the working environment,” Frieze said
in an email.

. Frieze said the committee is exam-
ining the current practices regarding
adjunct faculty throughout the vari-
ous schools within the University and
hopes to find ways to promote these
concerns to the regular agenda of the
Senate committees.

One concern is the numberofhours
adjunct faculty members put into their
work.

' Kovalik said adjunct professors are
often considered part-time faculty even
though they work full—time hours.

‘ “They don’t'take into account the
true prep time for courses,” he said.

Kovalikcompared Pitt to Walmart
when it comes to proper pay for em-

3

ployees and said the University does not
support unions. He added-that union-
ization could help secure beneﬁts such
as better pay, job security, health care
and a retirement plan.

While adjunct faculty have yet to

‘unionize, Service said the University

supports the eight existing unions that
represent approximately 700 of the
University’s employees.

“The University’s relationship with
all of them is non—contentious,” Ser-
vice said. I

Protestant work ethic leads to materialistic culture, bad health

Natalie Russell
Covluvmnist

It’s a truism echoed across party
lines: “Hard work builds charac-
ter.” I beg to differ.

Despite the nauseatingly self-
righteous quotes of Ben Franklin,
ambition can do more harm than
good ——— not for society necessar-
ily, but for the soul. As a result of
the Protestant work ethic, Ameri-
cans are wasting one-third of their
lives working. Inmany cases, it’s
for money they don’t even need.
Fueling this constant push for ma-
terial wealth is a pervasive sense

of inadequacy in which citizens -

are unsatisﬁed with their status
—— even if they’re well off.

Though the consequences of
hard work disproportionately af-
fect the poor, studies have shown
the tendency to work to death is
exhibited by members of all socio-
economic classes.

A studypublished in the Psy-
chological Science journal of the
Association for Psychological
Science this past June indicates
Americans are apt to earn more
than they could possibly consume.
The study tested subjects by offer-
ing them a deal: They could listen
to pleasant music and receive no
reward or listen to annoying white

noise and earn a chocolate candy
for each allotted time period.
Before beginning the task, sub-
jects were asked to estimate how
much chocolate they believed they
could consume. The average an-
swerwas 3.75. Once the task began,
subjects endured trial after trial un-
til they earned an average of 10.74

— pieces of chocolate, less than half

of which was actually consumed.

‘The propensity for mindless
accumulation is deeply ingrained
in the American psyche. It’s why
Americans are brainwashed into
thinking their salaries are corre-
lated with their value as human
beings. =

- And this shouldn’t come as a
surprise whatsoever. Globally, 134
countriesare ahead of the Unit-
ed States in legally capping the
maximum length of the average

work week. According to a United ’

Nations study, 85.8 percent of
American men and 66.5 percent
of American women work more
than 40 hours per week. Measuring
this on an armual scale with the rest
of the world, that’s 137 more hours
thanjapanese workers, 260 more
hoursthanBritishworkers and 499
more hours than French workers.
The frantic nature of accu-
mulating capital is unfortunately
logical forthe lower class, but what

kind of anxiety provokes the mid-
dle and upper classes tosstow away
more than they could ever need?
A 2013 study conducted by in-
vestment bank UBS revealed that
40 percent of people with $5 mil-
lion in investable assets said they
didn’t feel rich. Only 28 percent of
investors worth $1 million to $5
million viewed themselves as rich.
Many expressed concerns about
ﬁnancial insecurity bordering on
paranoia, with one especially ob-
noxious representative stating, “I
know that technically I am in the
one percent, but I don’t feel rich

I Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to the article
“Boycott Sparks Debate on Role of Aca-
demic Group” published Jan. 13, 2014.
As a student at Pitt who has visited the
Middle East on various occasions and has
entered into bothjewish and Arab neigh-
borhoods, I would like to shed some light
on the atrocity of the Academic Studies
Association boycott and the detriment

it will bring to the student body at any

university.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Professor Mazin Qumsiyeh parallels
his trip through Israeli checkpoints effect
on interregional academic integration
with the ASA boycott of Israeli academic
institutions. The ASA boycott is unparal-
leled. It is based on an ideology of false
condemnation of a sovereign people.
Checkpoints were implemented begin-
ning in 2000 to prevent terrorists (i.e.
suicide bombers) fromentering heavily
populated Israeli neighborhoods. When

' traveling from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,

my passport was checked routinely by

an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldier.

No harm was done and I was grateful for-.

the service of the IDF in halting terrorism
across the Green Line.
Additionally, he comments that the

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions move?

ment against Israel is analogous to the
human rights ﬁght in Apartheid-era South
Africa. Human rights exist in Israel. Ra-
mallah, Palestine, is a gorgeous city with
constant imports of Israeli produce. Ac-

cording to online economics news source

Trading Economics, 70 percent of all Pal-

estinian imports are from Israel.

I am grateful to attend an academic
institution that enables me to study freely
in Israel and allows other students to
grow academically while abroad in vari-
ous countries. Every student at every
American university should be provided
with this opportunity.

at all.”

Is this phenomenon a result of hyper—‘

consumerism? Infatuation with celebri-
ties? Or is this an expected outcome when
economic_ status is so static? We all have an
ideal standard of living, it’s just that the rich
set theirs to what the rest of us would call a
gluttonous level.

It makes sense: If you want to increase
productivity and capital, make your employ-
ees think they need more than $5 million to
be ﬁnancially secure. Make sure it’s never
enough.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported
the average productivity per American work-
er has increased 400 percent since 1950. But
with income disparity at an all—time high, it’s

clear that only the top dogs are reaping the

fruit of all this extra labor.

Wittekerke Winter
White
Brewery: Brouwerij
Bavik
Grade: B+

Though the holidays may be long gone,
many of us are still reaping the beneﬁts
of our holiday gifts. And what does a
person such as I ask for during the holi-

. days? Beer. New and exciting beer, made

even more delicious because I didn’t
have to pay for it.
Among my holiday haul was a mys-

_ terious blue bottle labeled Wittekerke

Winter White from Brouwerij Bavik in
Bavikhove, Belgium. As one should not
rush into a ﬁne Belgian ale, I waited for
the right chance to sample it ——- aichance
that materialized during a roommate

movie night featuring the classic dark‘

comedy “In Bruges.” A Belgian beer for
amovie set in Belgium seemed only too
appropriate. "

Being a wheat beer, Wittekerke
poured into a tulip glass with a pleas-
ing, cloudy golden hue. Given time
to settle, it retained its haze, show-
ing shades of light orange when held
up to a light. Typical of Belgian wheat
beers, the head rose to a solid inch and
a half before gradually settling down to
about the width of a finger. Due to the
higher protein contents of wheat beers,
their heads are often stronger and stick

around longer than beers brewed with
only barley.

As Colin Farrell delivered joyfully F-
bomb-ﬁlled rants on the screen, I tested
the beer’s aroma. The nose revealed a
strong sweetness that, given that Wit-
tekerke is_ 7.5 percent alcohol by volume
(fairly low for a Belgian beer), took me
by surprise. Usually just the boozier

(‘Belgians have this level of sweetness in

the aroma. Also present was a healthy
dose of orange peel citrus and maybe
even a bit ofcinnamon. To draw a com-
parison, it smelled like a subtler version
of Sam Adams’ Summer Ale.
Wittekerke was kind to the eye and
the nose, and it was equally pleasant to
the palate. The alcoholic sweetness that
came through in the beer’s aroma was
far gentler in its taste. Much like Ralph
Fiennes’ brilliant but short~lived per-

formance in “In Bruges,” the sweetness
brought the best out ofthe other ingre-
dients without overshadowing them.
Set against the background of mild
alcohol and subtle sweetness, the har-
dy wheat ﬂavor came to the forefront,
bringing the citrus with it. Unlike so
many other Belgian wheat beers that
I’ve had, Wittekerke’s flavor vanished
quickly, leaving no real trace on the
palate. It was a clean taste that made
me appreciate its relative simplicity.‘
Wittekerke is a versatile beer. A go-
anywhere, do-anything Belgian ale that,
in the nation’s ancient and complex beer
canon, is a rare thing. While it was far
from the best Belgian wheat beer I’ve
ever had, it provided a pleasant drink-
ing experience — one that I hope to re-
live ifl can get my hands on the elusive
brew again before the season is over.

glasses of water. A ,

Still, there have been fewplot twists
quite so strange, forced and utterly absurd
as Monday night’s debut of the ﬁfth season
of “Archer.” Relax, it’s not much of a spoiler.
Just know that everyone’s favorite cartoon
spy show isn’t a spy show anymore.

Welcome to “Archer Vice,” the show
that the heads of FX are hoping becomes
everyone’s favorite cartoon drug cartel
show. It’s a twist that is not only a nearly
unprecedented departure from the show’s
major premise, but also reveals the extreme
degree of faith FX has in the creators of one
of its‘top—billed shows.

The decision to abandon the central
theme of “Archer” wasn’t the resultlof a
calculated decision." According to an in-
terview conducted by Uproxx’s Kris Maske
with the show’s executive producer, Matt
Thompson, the abrupt change happened
for two major reasons. Theﬁrst was that
the show has only one writer — Adam Reed
(for anyone familiar with the show, this is

A a feat in and of itself) — which made the

shift easy to make without much of a hitch.

The second was that, as Thompson put it, ’

‘.‘Adam got bored,” and the show’s staff
decided that changing things up in a big
waywould keep the plotline interesting. p

More surprising than one man’s bore-
dom leading to an ‘entirely new plotline
for one of TV’s smartest shows is that FX
agreed to go through with it with few reser-
vations. Few other networks — or shows,

for that matter ‘— would be willing to pull”

off such a feat. It’s hard to picture the ex-
ecutives at AMC agreeing to let Vince Gilli-

gan turn “Breaking Bad” into a show about .

 

espionage or Fox letting “The X-Files” turn
into a show about two former FBI agents
who run a bar in Washington, D.C.

Yet this kind of behavior isn’t entirely
unprecedented for FX, which has devel-
oped a following for its often edgy com-
edies. This is, after all, the same network
that Louis C.K. deemed “irresponsible” at,
a Television Critics Association panel for
giving him full, unfettered creative control
over his hit show “Louie.” The mentality
at FX, it seems, is that the best shows are
made when the TV executives give writers
the reins and let them do what makes them
happiest: create good content.

It’s too early to know if the experiment
with “Archer” will wo rk, though the chanc-
es are pretty good. The show is often more
about its hilariously disturbed characters
and esoteric yet brilliant dialogue than the
morally blurry world of espionage. The
world of drug cartels is similarly blurry,
and as long as Reed is happy, the jokes and
references will likely be just as obscure as
they always have been. It’s a testament to
FX’s hands—ofl' approach, however, that he
- and the viewers — are getting a chance
to ﬁnd out. 3 ‘

Pitt exudes confidence prior to matchup with No. 2 Notre Dame

' Dave Uhrmacher
. Senior Staﬁ” Writer

Outsiders expect junior point guardLBri- A

anna Kiesel andvher teammates to lose
to Notre Dame tonight.

Even an onlooker who non—commit-J
tedly follows women’s college basketball
would say the Fighting Irish should win
tonight’s game handily.

3 But ahead of the matchup, the Pan-

thers'(9-8, 1-2 ACC) are exuding con-
ﬁdence that they can stick with a N 0. 2
Notre Dame (15—0, 3-0 ACC) squad that
is beating opponents by an average of
more than 28 points. - by ‘

- “If Virginia can stay with them, any-
one can stay with thern,”-fKgiesel said.
“They are good players, but they do‘ the
same things we do: put the jerseys on,

putthe shoeson, -same things we _do. ‘

Only thing is we have to out-work. them.”

- Less than a year ago, the Fighting
Irish came to the Petersen Events" Cen-
ter ranked second in the nation and left
with a 73-45 victory.,Tonight, they return

with the same rank and no losses in their _
vﬁrst season competing in the Atlantic

Coast Conference.

But Pitt’s conﬁdence is certainly
earned, as it enters the‘ game having won
two of its last four contests, including
victories over crosstown rival Duquesne
and a four-point victory over ACC foe
Virginia.

Pitt’s win over Virginia was signiﬁ- .

cant in_ multiple ways, as the Panthers
snapped an almost three-year-long con-
ference losing streak dating back to Feb.
15, 2011. The Fighting Irish played their
last game at Virginia, which resulted in a

7-point, 79-72 N otre Dame victory.

In the teams’ shared history ‘against

Virginia, Pitt ﬁnds a spot of conﬁdence
as it prepares for the conference’s best

team. ' _ .

“That is What we talk about-,” head
coach Suzie McConnell-Serio said. “We-
don’t have any pressure on us. No game
in the ACC,do we have pressure on us
because everybody has picked us last. So
we approach and prepare for every team

the same. We go out and just compete.”

Notre Dame’s trio of stars did most of

the scoring on Sunday in its win at Vir— ,

ginia. Senior for-;ward Natalie Achonwa
and senior guard Kayla McBride had 26
and 23 points, respectively, and sopho-
more guard Jewell Loyd contributed 17
points. ' I ' ' '

The 6-foot-3-inch‘ Achonwa also
posted 16 rebounds Sunday in Charlot-
tesville, Va., and will undoubtedly pres-
ent a matchup problem for Pitt, who will
counter with the more perimeter-based
senior forward Asia Logan.

Sports Editor

Pitt senior gymnast Katie O’Rourke has
been named the East Atlantic Gymnas- ~
tics League co—EAGL Specialist of the
Week, according to an announcement
from the league Wednesday. The Pan-
thers opened the first week of their
season Friday with a win over Towson
at the Fitzgerald Field House.

“What a way to start the season,”
Pitt head coach Debbie Yohman said.
“Katie has been working so hard. I have
said more than once she’s in mid—sea-
son form already, which will have her
routines looking sharp and even more
confident by championship season.”

O’Rourke delivered a meet-best and
career—high 9.85 score on the balance
beam Friday, and posted another score
of 9.85 on her floor routine. O’Rourke’s 
floor routine tied her with teammate
Lindsay. Offutt for first place at the
meet. . 

North Carolina sophomore Lexi Cap-
palli shared the honors with O’Rourke
after she earned scores of 9.775 for her
performance on the vault, 9.875 on the
uneven bars and 9.875 on her ﬂoor rou-
tine in the-Tar Heels’ victory over North
Carolina State.

O’Rourke, from Springﬁeld, Va_., was
a First Team All-EAGL selection for the
floor routine in herjunior season. She
was also named to the All-.EAGL Second
Team for the balance beam that year.

The league award is a continuation
of O’Rourke’s success in her junior cam-

paign and the solid start to her senior i
season.

Achonwa is just one of the weapons at
the disposal of Fighting Irish head coach
Muffet McGraw.-Her team has posted
more than 90 points in nine of the 15
games they have played.

McBride, an Erie, Pa., native, was
selected by ESPN as a Second Team pre-
season All-American. Described as. be-
ing, ‘~‘the best mid-range shooter in the
college game” by ESPN’s Graham Hays,
McBride led the Irish in scoring with 19
points when they visited the-Petersen

the program focus on one of twolthings:

Talking about the past (e.g. 13-9, Larry
Fitzgerald, Pitt’s 33-3 stretch from 1979-

81, etc.), or looking to the future (e.g. «

moving to the ACC, recruiting).

But what about right now? Where is
Pitt football right now?

After watching four seasons of Pitt
football, from the ﬁrst game of the ﬁnal
year of the Dave Wannstedt era to the

Little Caesars Pizza Bowl on Dec. 26, 2013,

the best way to describe the Panthers is
that they are just  stuck.

College football teams need to win to
recruit better‘ players, and college foot-
ball teams need to recruit better players
to win.

. Pitt’s recruiting efforts look better
under head coach Paul Chryst. Chryst is
building from the interior, bringing the
majority of his recruits onto the offensive
and defensive lines —— this makes sense
for a guy who says the teams that win the
battle on the line of scrimmage usually

win their games.

It’s unlikely that Pitt will ever be able
to recruit in the nation’s talent-rich pipe-
lines of California, Texas or Florida. But
the focus for Pitt right now must be on
controlling what the program can control.

For the Panthers, recruiting starts
with bringing in the best players from
the WPIAL. Wide receiver Tyler Boyd and

offensive tackle Dorian Johnsonwere a

good start last season, and pulling in Alex
Bookser and Mike Grimm should continue
to increase Chryst’s pull in the WPIAL.
In addition to the recent success of
Chryst’s local recruiting, he was able to

secure a commitment from Adonis Jen-
nings, a four-star wide receiver from New

. jersey ranked in the ESPN 300.

There will "always be challenges,
though, as top programs such as Ohio
State and Alabama will always be able to
show up at the 11th hour and poach those
players from under Pitt’s nose by offering
scholarships to the area’s premier talent.

Not to mention what will happen to
Pitt’s local recruiting efforts once Penn
State emerges from its sanction years.
‘Early forecast: probably -nothing good,
especially with new head coach James
Franklin laying downvthe gauntlet, stat-

ingthat the Nittany Lions will “dominate ,

the region.” , .. «

1 On gameday, the Panthers’ philoso-I

phy is centered on winning the games
they should, meaning beating teams like
Youngstown State and Navy, two notable
losses the team suffered under Chryst.

Not giving up multiple punt returns for -

touchdowns, as they did against North
Carolina this season. Not fumbling open-
ing kickoffs as they did against Miami.
The mental errors should be attrib-
uted to whomever is coaching the special
teams, but withhold judgment. on Pitt’s

. second-year headcoach. It’s unfair to

evaluate Chryst in any less than ﬁve years,
in which time he can bring in his own
players and put his brand of football on
the ﬁeld. _ “ ’ .

A If ‘he is the right man to pull Pitt out
of the rut the football program is in, then
we’ll ﬁnd out sometime. around the begin-
ning of 2018. That’s not to say the Pan-
thers will be playing for the Orange Bowl
at that point, but they might ascend to
something better than the Little Caesars
Pizza Bowl. I . ‘
