AWS By-law Structure

Scheduled for Revision

Associated Women Students will submit referendum of

“‘ 5- their revised by—laws for approval next Friday.

The by—laws, dealing mainly with structure, were pro-
posed by Senior Court last year before it went out of ex-
istence and have been the unofficial AWS code for this year.
The new laws have grown out of the new requirements of

ethe trimester.

Poet-Novelist
To Lead Coffee
Hour Today

Robert Penn Warren, noted
novelist, poet, literary critic and
editor, will lead an informal dis-

“cussion for University students at
a coffee hour at 3 p.m. in the main
lounge of the Student Union.

Warren, scheduled to speak at
noon today as part of the Midday
Series, will continue his com-
ments, criticisms and discussion of
his works.

Warren has been twice the win-
ner of the Pulitzer Prize. In 1946
his novel, ‘‘All the King’s Men”
won the award and in 1958, he
was again the recipient for
“Promises: Poems 1954 to 1956.”

Among his other novels are
“World Enough and Time.”
“The Cave,” and “Wilderness,”
which was published this month.
He is also the author of “Seg-
regation: “The Inner. Conflict in
the South”, and “The Legacy of
the Civil War.”

Warren completed his formal
education at Oxford as a Rhodes
Scholar. He has taught at many
universities, the most recent one
being Yale.

Policy-makers want the laws
and the organization brought up
to date and desire a mor general
set of laws so that constant re-
visions will not be necessary in
the future.

Changes Needed

The proposed revisions have
proved quite operable, but the
present Council and Exeutive
Board have made additional
changes where necessary.

The referendum will be held
next Friday from 9 a.m.’ to 4
p.m. on the 12th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral. All women students
may vote on the following
proposed structural changes:

1.) Previously the policy-mak-
ing power commission was com-
posed of representatives of wo-
men’s organizations and the offi-
cers of AWS. Under the revised
system, there will be ‘a policy-
making Power-Council, composed
of presidents of the women’s or-
ganizations and the Executive
Board of AWS. It is assumed that
the president of an organization is
more responsible concerning pol-
icy-making than any other repre-
sentative.

Eliminates Judiciary

2.) Previously the Executive
Board was composed of the elect-
ed ofﬁcers and the chairmen of
the class councils. The revised

To Decide Proposals

By JOSEY GROSSNIAN

The Senate voted Monday to have a student referendum
for consideration of student government reorganization.

The February 7 ballot will give the student three choices
—-the Reaves-Slotkin plan, the President’s plan, or the com-
plete disbanding of the governing body.

The Reaves-Slokin proposal calls for two senators per

500 students elected from each of°

the schools and the vice presi-
dents of the following groups
holding seats: AWS, IFC, Men’s
Council, Men’s Residence Hall
Council, Panhellenic Council, SU
Board, and Women’s Residence
Hall Council.
President Must Attend

In addition, the president would
be required to attend all Senate
meetings having no vote and could
be a member of but hold no office
or responsibility in any other
University — recognized organiza-
tion.

In the ~ President’s Plan,
Richard Sobota suggests that
the presidents of AWS, IFC,
Men's Council, Men’s Residence
Hall Council, Panhellenic Coun-
cil, SU Board, and Women’s
Residence Hall Council com-
bine with the presidents of the
cabinets of the schools of the
University to form the Senate.
The president, vice president,
secretary, and treasurer would
be elected by the students.

Jay Fingeret, President of the
Senate, told the group, “It’s the
job oi‘ the senators to let students
know the contents of each plan.
if you really believe in these
plans, it is your duty to get out
there and do. this.”

Pease Speaks

Joe Seiger added, “it’s not only
the duty 01 the senators but that
of the Pitt News and WPGH to
do their best to objectively in-
form the student body about
whats happened here today.”

Ronald N. Pease, SK advisor,
commented, “You’ve met your
challenge half way in present-
ing these alternatives to the

Rhodes
Scholarship
Awarded

Jay Butler, now a student at
Harvard University, majoring in
history, but previously, a student
at the University, has been award-
ed a Rhodes Scholarship to study
at Oxford University in London.

The award was announced by
the Rhodes Committee on Decem-
ber 20. Butler is the first Univer-
sity student to ever receive a
Rhodes Scholarship.

Butler, one of 32 Rhodes Schol-
ars selected from all over the
country this year, spent his fresh-
man and sophomore years at the
University in 1957.and 1958.

While at the University, he.
sides his regular classwork, But-
let did individual study with
Dr. John C. Crowe in English,
and with Dr. John Geise in his-

tory. According to Dr. Geiseg

Butler was, “a very able stu.
dent, brilliant in many respects.”
Dr. Crowe refers to the awardee
as, “having a. high capacity for
thoughtful penetration in any
ﬁeld.”

After completing two years at
the University, Butler, originally
from Ogden, Utah, was called to
do Mormon missionary work
among lumbermen in the Paciﬁc
Northwest. He spent two years in
this work. He then continued his
education at Harvard, and will
graduate from there this June,

Butler plans to spend two years
studying at Oxford. However, the
Rhodes Trust can extend this pt-
riod to three years if they so de-
cide.

Although Butler is graduating
as a history major, his ultimate
aim is in the ﬁeld of law. After
his period of study in England, he
hopes to continue his study of law
in a major school of law.

The, Rhodes Scholarships were
established by the will of Cecil
John Rhodes for Oxford College.
They were to be available for

male students from the British ‘

dominions and colonies, the U.S.,
and Germany. In 1916, the Ger-
man scholarships were annulled.

DEADLINE
The deadline for submitting
material to the Liberal Arts
Publication, “Ideas and Figures,”
is January 31. The staff is con.
Siderins poetry, fiction, essays,
art and photography.

Book Store Displays;

 sIci Art Carvings

Original Sculpture Made of Bones

Wtzlrlts Ivory, Soapstone, Antler

A whale carved of polished soapstone, the stone ﬁgure-

of a hunter holding a tiny ivory spear, and a small canoe or
Kayak are among 26 pieces of art now on display in the
University Book Store’s Fine Books Room.

Robert Bergmann, head of that department, said that
they are the only Pittsburgh store selling the original Eskimo

art. The first day they were dis-0

played, three were sold.

The carvings, original art, not
mass-produced or duplicated.
are distributed by Eskimo Art,
Inc., a non-proﬁt group which
is distributing the art “to “en-
courage understanding and ap-
preciation of Eskimo art.”

The carvings come from the
Canadian and Eastern Arctic re-
gions. They are made of soap-
stone, harder stones, and walrus
ivory.’

Knives of scrap metal set in
bone handles are used for carv-
ing and rough stones are used for

"polishing. After the sculpture is

carved, it is submerged in seal
all to bring out the reds and the
greens in the stone.

Anthropoligists disagree as to

lwhy the Eskimos make carvings.

Some say it is art for art’s sake,
while others believe it is the Es-
kimo’s attempt to gain magical
control over animals.

Coordinates Admission

Most of Norian’s time will be
spent in an administrative posi-
tion over various departments not
as yet selected, and in coordinat-
ing admitting procedure. He will
also devote a good deal of time to
research in the Department of
Medical and Hospital Administra-
tion in the University’s Graduate
School of Public Health.

Noroian held the position of
administrative assistant to the
executive director of Hartford
Hospital previous to his work
at the University of Maryland
Hospital.

He has accrued a BA. degree
from Long Island University, M.A.
from Columbia University and a
masters in public health from Yale
University, and is now working
toward a Ph.D. degree from Co-
lumbia.

Along with the many articles on
hospital methods he has written,
Noroian has worked on an explan-
ation of the changing patterns of
emergency room care, in collab-
oration with Dr. Shortliffe.

A possible explanation for Nore-
ian’s administrative ability can be
found in his experiences during
World War II, where, at the age
of 18, he became chief of a per-
sonnel section in Tokyo keeping

track of 1,500 enlisted men and
6,000 Japanese laborers.

‘Emergent Africa’

thropology, will toach the course.

The lectures will discuss the
racial problems of South Africa
and western civilization, the rea-
sons for Congo’s continuing crisis,
African contribution to American
culture and predictions for the
future of African nations.

The classes will be conducted in

Behavior Study
Findings Listed

In Data Catalogue
By RACHEL GOSS

A small room—512 CL holds
ﬁles containing a .wealth of
information on human cul-
tures. Few students are aware
of these vast research sources
at their disposal. ,

The University is the second
elected member in Human Rela-
tions Area ﬁles, Inc., an inter—uni-
versity organization which com-
piles and catalogues data in the
behavioral sciences including an-
thropology, sociology, geography
and human biology.

Dr. George P. Murdock, Andrew
Mellon Professor of social anthro-
pology at the University, directed

the assembling of the ﬁles of"

source material at the Institute of
human relations organized at
Yale University almost a quarter

of a century ago.

Used During War

The files then known as the
Cross Cultural Survey proved
valuable during World War II
when the navy sponsored the as-
sembly of information in the
Paciﬁc Islands held by the Jap-
anese. Later the information be-
came the basis for handbooks on
the cultures in the area for use by
the government.

The ﬁles, expanded and re-
titled HRAF, were distributed
on a wider basis at the request
of educational institutions.

The cultures are arranged in
the files by major areas, Asia,
Africa, Europe, the Middle East,
North America, South America,
Russia and Oceania. The categor-
ies of information which include
ﬁnance, labor, fine arts and re-
ligion are as complete as pos-
sible.

Lecturer to Receive
Engineering Award’

Clarence J. Baldwin Honored
For Electronic Computer Work

Clarence J. Baldwin, a

lecturer in the University’s

School of Engineering and Mines will receive one of the top
U.S. engineering awards for his work with computers.

The 32-year-old Westinghouse electrical engineer, who
was a straight A student in the University’s E & M schoo1’s
program for Graduate Study in Industry, originated one

of the two courses he teaches.

The Eta Kappa Nu Award for
engineers under the age of 35 will
be presented to Baldwin at a ban-
quet in New York City on Jan-
uary 29.

As head of an eight-man re-
search team, Baldwin found a
way to utilize digital computers
in long-range planning of elec-
tric utility systems. Applying a

technique known as “simula-
tion,” he reproduced the indus-
try’s output, costs, prices and
demand for Eoods and. services
in mathematical terms as nearly
as possible. .

When the computer's operator
changes one or more of these
items, the machine measures the
effects of the change upon all of
the other items. In that manner,

years of change are compressed
into minutes.

Baldwin, born in San Antonio,
Texas, received a B.S. ingelectrical
engineering and a master's degree
from the University of Texas.

Another former University stu-
dent, Howard A. Zollinger, receiv-
ed an honorable mention from the

works for Westinghouse and re-
ceived his master's degree from

Enrollment Statistics

"If the rate of student increase is maintained, by the
year“_2045 university enrollment will number one million
plus. This statement was issued recently by an administra-
tor of the University of Denver to indicate the degree of
‘expansion experienced atthat school.

Although this.University is also experiencing a high
degree of redevelopment, students here have littletfaith
, that Pitt can ever approach such’ enrollment ﬁgures even
, with, a half million handicap.

' Such pessimism, in regardito student enrollment, ﬁrst
» started with the advent of the trimester system, has intensi-
ﬁed to great proportions with the recent tuition raise.

For many people, a quick look at last year’s entering.
freshman class and, this year’s application ﬁgures to date
indicate a failure on the University’s part to attract any
“students, let alone any good students. A class of 1100 fresh-
men from 3800applications this past fall seems to indicate
“that the University is only second and third choice material
for the college—minded high school student. And with the
is increased tuitionrequired in the fall, predictions run that
I next year’s ﬁgures will be even worse. ,

, But one year’s statistics can hardly‘ be used as criteria
a ‘for designating an over-all trend. As Chancellor Li-tchﬁeld
9 pointed out recently,slast year’s ﬁgures were “somewhat

of a freak,’.’ fora number of reasons. It is necessary to go
a back only two yearsto see that this year’s application
a I ‘ﬁgures of 1200 by mid-January, are the sam_e if not slightly
rhigher than those of 1959, for the same period.

  
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
   
 
  
  
  
  
      
  
   
   
  
     
     
   
 
    
   
  
  
     
  
    
    
   
   
 
   
  
   
    
   
   

those people the University is currently attractingto ﬁll
its seats are not college material. The University has, so it
I seems, lowered its standards to ﬁll its quota.

Judging from ﬁgures released recently analyzing Pitt
under’ the Litchﬁeld regime, such is not the case. Since

lege Board), required of all entering freshman, has jumped

z freshmen in 1956 were from the top one-fifth of their high
I schoolclasses. Today that ﬁgure is 65 percent. A
While no one is trying to pretend; that the increases

ﬁgures are an impressive argument that Pitt isnot going
9 downhill. What still remains unanswered, however, is the
‘University’s justiﬁcation of thoseéflﬁgures when the in-
creased ﬁeld of high school applicantsis considered along
lwith the resultant pressure for higher admission standards

look so much more impressive because we had so much
. more to improve?
9 Yet important as that question seems now, it loses much
in the ﬁnal scheme of things. As long as the University
can maintain its present rate .of improvement and can pro-

' attempt an explanation of this

Yogi Bear’. or Yoga ? . ..

  Disciplined Awareness

By Vosonth K. Bhoi

If, when I ﬁrst arrived in Pittsburgh, I had mis- '
taken “Yogi Bear” for an Indian yogi (one adept
at yoga) it would have been an understandable er-
ror. I am proud to report that I have discovered the
difference.

Realizing, however, that few Americans know
much more about yoga than I
originally knew about the car-
toon character, I have decided to

unique discipline.

Originally, yoga was a prac-
tice related to religious philos-
opy, essential to the Hindu con-
cept of “awareness” or to lay
oneself open to innumerable sur-
prises and unbelievable revela-
tions. Although yoga has lost
much of its religious signiﬁcance
in present-day India a great number of Indians
still perform at least a few basic yoga exercises for
physical, intellectual and emotional discipline.

 

‘ Indeed the efficacy of yoga is such that its aims,
methods, results and different forms will interest’
not only the mystic and student of the occult, but
also the doctor, the psychiatrist, and the anthro-
pologist. '

The yogi goes straight to the root of the most
powerful instincts, those which more forcibly hold
us within the domination of matter. He is able to
control his vital functions by a thorough knowledge
of the particular processes and emotive regions
through which the vital instincts hold sway over
the body and the mind. i

Gradually, through the training of yoga, the
adept transcends the elements of appearancexand
is able to perform extraordinary feats. By con-
centrating on the heart, he attains the knowledge

' of "consciousness; ’by concentrating on the hollow of

the neck, he gains freedom from hunger and thrist;
by concentrating on words, meanings and knowl-
edge separately, the‘ yogi understands the language
of all creatures; by concentrating on theimain art-

ness of body and mind-

These acts, one may conclude, are too difficult
for an ordinary person. But this is not so. As
Bhagavad Gita declares, “. . . this yoga is not at:
tained by him who eats too much, nor by him who

abstains from food, nor by him who oversleepsnor it it

by him. who keeps awake. This yoga-which de-
stroys pain is achieved by him whoieats and be-
haves as is proper, whose all actions are led by
reason, whose ‘sleep and wake are regulated.”

Among the several forms of yoga, Hatha yogaif

is the most popularly known.

disciplines by which the body. and the vital ener.

‘ gies can be brought under control.

Most Popular Posfures

Two of the most commonly practiced disciplines:
are the lotus and head postures. In the lotus pos-
ture, the two feet are placed soles up on the two

thighs. l.This posture is recommended for breath-_'"‘

ing exercises since the central artery of the body
trunk remains naturally straight and respiration
becomes rhythmical.

The lotus posture is said to cure almost all ail-» ‘

ments———heart and lung diseases, digestive troubles,
fevers, skin aﬂlictions, etc. This postures also helps
to conquer laziness, sleep; mental weakness and
other defects. Before and after thisposture, how-
ever, much walking should be avoided.

In the head posture the head is placed on the
ground, both palms beside the head and the body
is raised erect. This posture is said to increase
health, beauty, strength, sexual powers, swiftness,
activity and awaken the coiled energy. The head
posture should be practiced only once a day, in
the morning before eating,, and should not be
maintained, for more than one hour.

On the whole, yoga, if practiced assiduously,
can bring the subconscious under control, overpass
the senses and obtain the modes of perception
which lead to remarkable achievements in the
spiritual, intellectual and physical ﬁelds.

Enemy For Firestone
Editor, the Pitt News:

After reading Mr. Fireston_e’s
article “Conservative Crisis” in

"the January 8 issue of the Pitt

z News, ’ I cannot refrain _ from
making a reply.

I ‘hope that such misspellings
as ‘repurcussions’ and ' alien-
nation’ are editing errors and not
those of one so obviously intent
on making a pedantic display of
knowledge ranging from political
science to Peruvian ethnology.

According to ‘Mr. Firestone, a
conservative at best is onepwho
is a century behind the times,
and from that point the gamut
runs from those possessing neu-
rotic tendencies to the lunatic
fringe and other conglomerations
of the derranged.

They are easily recognized by
such traits as cowardliness, lack
of imagination, and, demagog-
uery.. I have not had the plea-
sure of meeting him, but judging
from the content of his article
which is grossly slanted and vin-
dictive, I could safely predict he
possesses the characteristics he
decries in others. ,

I feel that in _our democratic
society which is dedicated to
'-protecting the rights of minori-
ties against the dictates of the

majority and vice versa, there is '

room for a wide range of opinion
’ on each subject and that ex-
treme views, in the main, merely

act as catalytic agents .. to pro-— 
. mote action against over—conser-

vatism or .extre’me radicalis’

Student Defends -

Conservative Position
Editor, the Pitt News:

As a student with‘ a concern

‘for the philosophical bases for

political beliefs, I must" reply in
part to some of Mr. Nathan Fire-
sto‘ne’s criticism of “Conserva~..
tism” in hiscolumn in the Jan-
uary 8 Pitt News. The criticisms
I am concerned .with‘ here are

those dealing with the ‘‘back-\

wardness” of conservatism_ and
its disapproval of social‘ legisla-
tion. -

Those who make such crii-[is

cisms of conservatism fail to
make note of some of the foun-
dations of these political beliefs.
It is a philosophy which includes
a respect for the individual man
.—-a respect‘ for his right to be,
essentially, an individual, It in-
cludes the premise that a man
cultivates this freedom of in-
dividuality when he is not en-
gulfed or subjugated by an in-
stitution -- whether this institu-

One of the difficulties inthei

application of this philosophy

lies in the fact that all are not
equally endowed with ability to
provide for their needs. But

there are much less constraining.

solutions to the problem than
national social legislation. A so-
cial -atrnosphe-re which would
produce individuals ‘trained to

think and act for themselves, A

would encounter far fewer of
thosegwho know ofnowhere else
to turn but to the great insti-
tution to care for their needs.

refutable argument designed to
convince all that “Conservatism”
is the wholly Right answer to all
America’s ills._but to show that

Student Redefines

Firestone's ‘Progress’

Editor, the Pitt News:

Nathan Firesctone seems to
state in his article, “Conserva-
tive Crisis," that “respectable
conservatism" is a “disease” and
a “danger” for two reasons: (1) C
the conservative hinders United
States progress in increased so-
cial legislation, and (2), the con-
servative hinders forward move-
ment of the U.S. in world posi-
tion.

Mr. Firestone apparently lik-
ens “progress” to increased social
legislation by the federal gov-
ernment. If “progress” is the loss
of i individual economic liberty,
then Mr. Firestone is correct, for
the conservative stands in direct
opposition to this.

If we must muddle about in

word terms, “progress” is per-

haps in the direction of increas-
ed individual liberty through
private enterprise, rather than
loss of liberty through federal
control. Considering “progress”
in this light, the conservative is
very progressive.

The conservative argument
against increased social legisla-
tion has never been unintellig-
ible to me. Socialism, be it
creeping or otherwise, entails the
negation of private enterprise,
and’ thus the loss of individual
economic liberty.

Although it cannot be said
that social legislation by the fed-
eral government is socialism it-
self, this legislation is obviously
heading more toward socialism
than away from it. I cannot con-
sider this progress in the sense
of improvement.

Mr. Firestone contends also
that the UN. represents our hope
for a peaceful victory over Com-
munism, when the very ex-
amples he cites at the beginning
of his article are precisely those
that have shown the ineffective-
ness of the U.N. Only an opinion
which ignores reality can be

Conservative Defends,
‘Old Time Liberalism’.

Editor, the Pitt News:

I feel obliged to reply to Mr.
Nathan Firestone in regard to
his article entitled “The Conser-
vative Crisis.”

Mr. Firestone criticizes the
Conservative movement on the
basis of its domestic policy and
its foreign policy. Conservatism’s
domestic policy, he contends, is a
hindrance to America’s progres-
sive step forward, but the very
gained thus far has been "old
basis of the progress we have
time liberalism.”

Under this philosophy, the
United Sta.es emerged as the
world’s great economic power.‘

“They are the loudest advo-
cates of the Constitution yet they
are opposed to granting consti-
tutional rights to all of our citiz-
ens,” claims Firestone. Whether
or not one agrees with the con-
servative position on segregation,
its position is consistent and not
hypocritical. Conservatives have
a high regard for states’ rights,
for local self-determination and
for a’ guarantee of freedom from
the encroachment of the federal
government, I all guaranteed by
the Constitution.

The conservative foreign policy
is neither neurotic or unreason-
able, as Mr. Eirest'one.wou1d
have us believe. It is based, on
the well veriﬁedcontention that

Separate ‘Fantasy’ _
From ‘Reality’
Student Says

Editor, the Pitt News: . .

In reading “Who Will Vote?"
by Barry Gross, in the January
10 issue, I found it impossible
to determine if the writer had
drawn clear distinctions between
the fantasy-world depicted in
“Starship Troopers”. by Robert
A. Heinlein from which Mr.
Gross quoted, and the realities of
the twentieth century world.

Responsibility as a citizen
gained through a period or a
lifetime of military service
seemed to be the core of Mr.
Gross’ extractions from Hein-
lein’s book.

Mr. Gross carried Heinlein’s
theory a step further by quota-
tions to the effect that “ ‘author-
ity and responsibility must be
equal,’ ” and suggestions that a
soldier necessarily places the
welfare of his group ahead of
himself.

This certainly doesn’t square
with the experience of thousands
who have seen men become

completly selfcentered in their
desire to survive or even to
possess the comforts of their
civilian backgrounds.

As to “earning thv right to
vote” does not this seem to be
something that involves ‘a little
more than obedience, but per-
haps, love of one’s country and
fellows, belief in mankind as
well as other positive traits?

Would not any kind of military
“conditioning” be a repudiation
of all the established and in-
herent principles of a democracy,
as well as an outright admission
of the failure of American pa-
rents, religious leaders and
teachers to explain and inter-
pret Democracy to the young.

I submit that Mr. Gross has
carried much too far the pro-
jected ideas of Mr. Heinlein’s
super-state which smells to me
like the same old 1984 mono-
lithic and state militarists have
been trying to establish for cen-
turies.

Gross asserts: “The person who
has undergone at least two years
of service before being allowed"
to vote, would put some thought
into his voting and this resulting
awareness of the responsibility
behind the voter’s authority
might very well improve a de-
mocracy."

As one who served for several
years, I have grave doubts that
our armed forces produce better
qualiﬁed voters than does civil-
ian life. Learning to obey orders
without questioning —- “Theirs
but to do or die” —- provides
little training in the reflective
weighing of evidence and issues
so necessary to intelligent voting.

Review of ‘A Man in a Mirror’

Pagelsl  NEWSWW-— Wednesday,

   

January A 1'7, 1962 ‘

Llewellyn Book Seen
Realistic and Timely

By BARRY GROSS
Tradition and responsibility permeate James Teren’s
every thought and action in Richard Llewellyn’s “A Man in

a Mirror” (Doubleday; 431 pp.

; $5.75).

Teren is a six foot eight inch Masai warrior who is try-

ing to integrate parts of modern European culture with his

peop1e’.s tradition. His task is to lead the tribes through

the turmoil of twentieth century:

Africa.
' James Teren is a leader of the
nomadic Masai, a tribe old enough
to have been mentioned by Here-
in “The I-Iistories.” He is
named Nterenke, son of Ngati, son
of Nkara.
Educated in Europe

But James Teren is also the
first of‘ his tribe to be educated
by European schooling as well as
by Masai tradition. When he goes
into the cities to discuss the status
of his tribe among newly form-
ing African states, he wears the
dark grey suit of the European
and his long braids are shaven
from his head.

He realizes that the Masai
mustbe educated if they are to
exist as a people and utilize
these parts of European culture
which can enrich their nomadic
society.

Disturbing factors cause Nter—
enke to move very slowly. There
is the example of the neighbor-
ing Kiuku, who completely over-
threw their traditions to become
Europeanized and now serve the
white men as cheap labor, There
are the two young Masai women,
Mtsula and Bti], Martha and
Betty, who studied nursing and
social welfare in Europe, and now
choose not to live among their
people. J

Studies Effects

Representatives from numerous
African states are urging the
Masai‘ to join a certain nation or
to explode into the anti-European
violence of Mau—Mau.

The author does more, though,
than present the difﬁcult ques-
tion of how to adopt some of
modern Europe’s culture with-
out destroying the framework
of African tradition. He skill-
fully centers his attention upon
James Teren—Nterenke, explor-
ing the mixed effects of Masai
and European ideas upon him,
and giving some insight into the
Masai mind.

The Masai sees the Europeans

as people who “talk from insider

themselves . . .,” people who rely
“on a hope of strength that no-
body else sees.”
Chief Speaks
At a meeting of African lead-
ers and politicians, the chief of
Nterenke’s tribe sums up the
staadfastness of Masai tradition
and their resistance to change.
Asked about pressure from vari-
ous sources, he remarks: “We are
not subject to any pressure. Peo-
ple speak. They go away.”

cessfully pictured Nterenke’s
traditional upbringing and his
struggle to bring the Masai into
the modern world. He has‘ made
the clarity of the novel’s char-
acters independent upon their
parts in Nterenke’s world.

The youths who grew .up with
Nterenke form a background of
tradition, blending with the veldt
and the jungle. The tribal lead-
ers, Nterenke’s father, and the
Europeans he deals with are
sharply focussed personalities,
sharing Nterenke’s driving desire
to improve the Masai. They all see
the same man Nterenke sees in
the mirror -— a realistic link be-
tween Africa’s past and Africa’s
future.

Rubbing Prints

Throughout the month of Janu-
ary, an exhibition of stone rub-
bings will be on display in the
University’s Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Gallery, 726 CL.

Rubbings are prints made by di-
rect contact with sculptured art.
The display is composed of sec-
tions of the facade of the Angkar
Vat, an ancient temple in Cambo-
dia; an old English brass which
covers the tomb of a 14th century
crusader; and a stele, or pillar-
like monument, from a. Chinese
tomb.

The rubbings were made by
two methods, the Chinese and
the Old English.

The Old English method con-
sists of‘ dry paper and waxed
crayons used in a manner similar
to trading. In the Chinese method,

ﬁne quality rice paper is wet and '

pressed onto the art work, and the
ﬁgures are brushed with ink.

Language Institute       

The National Defense Education
Act’s National Language Institutes
Section of the US. Office of Edu-
cation has authorized a summer
institute at the University.

The institute is an attempt by
the NDEA to upgrade the teaching
of languages in the United States
by giving teachers practical ex-
perience in conversing with peo-
ple who speak the language they
teach.

The teachers will also learn to
operate the new language labs at
the University. They will need
this practice because high schools
all over the country are installing
language labs ﬁnanced through
federal grants.

  

 

The proposal for the inst.i1;uge'
made by the University. calls for
three sections of twenty teachers
each chosen from
school teachers of Spanish and
French. The staff of people who

have had living experiences in

speaking French or Spanish; will
be chosen mostly from the Uni-
versity and partly from other in-
stitutions.

During theseven week institute,
from June 25 through August. 10,
the participants will speak only
French or Spanishand engage in
practice with the language labs,
courses in linguistics, conversa-
tion, and literature. ~

INDIAN TWISTER

Mohbatsinm Bhurubha Chudasama props himself upright on his
head at foul‘ 0’C10Ck in ‘he m01‘11iI1g, is a part-time janitor in the
psychology department, an ex-cricket player, and he doesn’t eat
cow’s meat. .

Fortunately, for the sake of a coach with an Oklahoma drawl,
tongue-twisted announcers, and linotypists short on lead, he answers
to the name of “Mike.”

Mike hails from Gujarat, India, a big town that boasts of 200
cotton mills within the city limits. He’s the son of a local gendarme,
and a sophomore in the electrical engineering school at Pitt
"Turkish Bath" -

But Mike doesn’t spend all of his waking hours standing on his
head, sweeping manure from rat cages, or studying his engineering
textbooks. He spends two hours a day working out with the Pitt
wrestling team in the gigantic “Turkish bath house” whose climate
is similar to that of the region along the equator. This tropical

...elimat.e should be to Mike’s liking, but it isn’t.

The first observation that he made of the place, according
to Dave Weitzel, another wrestler whobrought Mike to the Field
House originally, was that “he thought this was too hot. He
felt that it should be cool,
outdoors, and refreshing.”

In the land of India the am-
bitious youngsters claw away at —
the cool white sand until they 
have a pit deep enough to crawl -
into, and then they turn viciously
on one another.

x_,

But Mike still comes because

“of my deep love for wrestling.”

(He’s the only wrestler who

_\goesn’t say ‘rassler.’) “I don’t ﬁnd

the exercise arduous,” he says,

“but the wrestling part is quite
strenuous.”

Mike the Yogi

Fracl-ices Yoga

“I can’t study at night as I’m so tired, so I get up at four o’clock
in the morning to study, and then I do exercises too. I practice
certain holds," he claims, “and I also practice yoga.”

To demonstrate his proﬁciency in a lost ’art at Pitt, Mike
twisted himself like a pretzel for a few seizure—like moments.
“He looks like a camel walkin’ around here,” Coach Rex Peery
remarked. “He does push-ups upside down and his navel just
about reaches my chin he gets so high up.” .

Mike gets high up when he starts to talk of Peery, too. “He’s
everything,” Mike says. “Everything owes to him —— his kindness. He
gives to anybody a chance who has more power. Hardly anybody is

“twer absent. I would not miss.”

Mike is impressed by Peery’s energy at the age of fifty. “He
takes hard trouble cause he also himself does hard exercises. He
trains all these people by heart. This team belongs to Mister Peery.”
New Eating Habits

Even though the 1.24-pounder hasn’t had to lose any weight on
purpose yet, his chestnut-colored face breaks into a wide grin when
he speaks of his new eating habits.

“I drink much more milk,” he says, “cause more energy is
needed. ‘I can’t eat meat, cooking is such in this country that

. I can't eat meat. We wouldcall it raw meat in our country. We
cook for a long time. I can’t even cut it with a knife here. I eat
little, but no beef ——- I _can’t eat of the cow.”

Mike writes to his parents often, but he hasn’t told them about
his wrestling aspirations. “My mother is of such heart,” he explains,
"that she would worry. I am away from homevso many miles, and
“she would misunderstand. V

“‘She would think that it’s too much of a risk!”

What did Mike think about Pitt’s decisive win over Syracuse
which he saw last Saturday? “We were too much for Syracuse,” he
Says. “We really shot them down!”

firsts on any given day.” He was
also an Olympic candidate.

Although most of Pitt’s squad
seemed a little nervous in the sea-
son’s opener, Sophomore John
Franchuk, who may become a one
event specialist, went through his
series of stunts on the parallel
bars like an experienced veteran
and took a first place.

It is very possible that Fran-
chuk patterns himself after Ed

Timmons Hopes
To Improve

On 8 - 5 Record

By ART FLEISCHNER
The Pitt basketball squad
will travel to New York to-
night where they will play
an oft—beaten Columbia quin-
tet. The last time the Pan-

thers made the trip to the big city
they defeated a strong Fordham
team by a single point.

Tonight’s game will be a big
test for the Cats. Many fans will
want to see if the Westminster
victory was just a ﬂuke, if the
team will revert to the form they
showed in the Penn State game or
it last Saturday’s performance was
an indication of things to come.

Coach Jack Rohan has been
having his problems. He took over
the job this year only to learn
that his high scorer, Mark Port-
noy, had to leave school because
of the recent basketball ﬁxes.

Wrestlers Seek Second Win
Against Powerful Army Team

‘Visitor Advantage
May Aid Panthers

By BOB SMIZIK

It is not often that a visit-
ing team has the advantage
in sports, but the Panther
wrestling squad may be able
to use their visiting status to
great advantage when they
meet Army on Saturday at West
Point.

In wrestling, the home squad
has to announce its wrestlers tirst,
and thus the visitors have the ad-
vantage of being able to pick the
right man.

lCoach Rex Peery will cautious-
ly await to see who Army mentor
Leroy Alitz places on the mat be-
fore he makes his decision. Alitz

CRACK CADET Al Rushatz, ,

Lions lost to Harvard and defeated
Dartmouth on Saturday night.
This win might have given the
vict0ry—sta1‘ved team the incen-
tive it needs to make the Panther
record 8-6.

Bob Timmons’ boys will
continue their traveling ways
on Saturday night when they
travel to Morgantown to face
nationally rated West Virginia.

As the paper goes to press the
boys of Coach George King have
compiled an 11-3 record. Their
120 points against George Wash-
ington last, Saturday night was a
school record. The team is led by
junior All-American candidate
Rod Thorn.

Thorn leads the team in four
major departments: scoring, re-
bounding, ﬁe1d_ goal percentage
and assists, a-feat that not even
such stars as Hot Rod Hundley
and Jerry West were able to ac-
complish. ‘

Something which Panther fans
can recall is last year’s triumph
by the Pitt freshmen snapping a
West Virginia winning streak 01
21 games. Judging by the per.
formance of the Panther sopho-
mores against Westminster, the
fans at Morgantown might be in
for a repeat of history.

has the versatile Al Rushatz at his
disposal. Rushatz one of the ﬁnest
Wrestlers in the nation, can be
used at 167, 177 or 191 pounds
and still come up with a good
performance.
Switch Harrison

If Rushatz wrestles at 167
pounds, then Peery will probably
insert Jim Harrison at 177 pounds,
rather than risk a possible loss.

What could cause the Cats a

big headache is if Rushatz is
entered in the 191 pound cate-
gory. Peery would probably have
no choice but to insert Tom
Jetfrieshagainst the Cadet cap-
tain, and although Jetifries is no
pushover Rushatz would have to
rate as favorite.

If Peery does not want to use
Jeifries against Rushatz he could
move the sophomore into the
heavyweight ranks where he
would meet the dangerous Dale
Kuhns, who is no Rushatz.

Kelvington vs. Natvig

Peery will probably go with the
same lineup that he used against
Syracuse which means that Daryl
Kelvington will face Mike Natvig.
Natvig beat John Zolikofi twice
last year and took a second place
in the 1961 Easterns.

At 137 pounds Zolikoff will have

Save ‘Face’ In Track Loss

By SANDY

RESNICK

Navy forced Pitt’s track team to walk the plank and
jump into thecold waters of defeat last Saturday by smoth-

ering the Blue and Gold 77-32.
The Midshipmen were too

powerful and Pitt could only

salvage three ﬁrst places. The most interesting first place was
taken by Joe Friend, high school state high hurdles cham-

pion from Lancaster, Pa., who setO
a new IC4A meet record in the
60 yard high hurdles.

Pitt pole valuters Dave Gar-
wood and Gary Meckly tied for
ﬁrst place in this event. Both boys
were exceptional trackmen in high
school.

Carter Wins .

Vance Carter copped the 1000
yard run for the Panthers by
out-running Navy’s Robert Havey
and his own teammate Jon Hart.
Although Jack Heine wonithe
mile run for Navy, Steve Waslo
and Bob Tarkany made a good

and third spots for Pitt.
But these bright performances

were mere chinks in the armor
of the Navy brass. Panther
Coach Carl Rees was not con-

tacted for an explanation pf the I

one sidedness of the meet, but
there is a stereotyped statement
kept on file in The Pitt News
sports ﬁles that is routine for a.
meet with a service academy
team:

“They had too much depth for
us,” Rees says. “They had a fresh
man in every event. The academy
men are always in such fine phys-
ical condition because of the rig-
orous training they go through,
that we don’t have the strength
to match them.”

West Virginia
Hosts Smaller
Cub H oopsters

By LEN BERENFIELD
The freshman basketball team is
now busily preparing to meet

.West Virginia at Morgantown on

Saturday._ The Panthers hopes to
get back . on the winning track
with a triumph over the Moun-

taineers after losing to the Beth- ‘
any..Reserves last week. West Vir-_ ’
_ ginia will be doing its best,'how-
,-ever, to stiﬂe Pitt’s_ hopes, and is
«expected to provide stiff opposi-

tion for the Cubs.

Leading the West Virginia at-
tack on Saturday will ‘be Rick
Ray, a shifty backcourt performer

who was on the West Virginia All-

State high school basketball squad.
The Mountaineers will carry a
decided height advantage into the
contest. Marty Lentz at _6-6, and
John Funk, 6-7, are the tallest
Mounties.

The Pitt squad will go into the
game Saturday with a 3-2 mark
after the 67-53 loss to Bethany.

Although the Panther Cubs
fought gamely, the Bethany at-
tack was too much for them.
Brian Fisher led the Pitt effort
with 12 points, while Marty

Shottenheimer and Bill Roan-

O tree chipped in with 11. Beth-

any’s Hickman, however, took

game honors garnering 21 points.
Actually, .Bethany was not a
freshman team, but as Pitt coach
Carl Peterson puts it, “The pur-

pose of our freshman team is not
to build an impressive record, but

rather, to build varsity ballplayers
through tough competition.”

Army has a line sophomore
.123 pounder in Floyd Welker.
However, Coach Alitz may move
him to 130 pounds, instead of
wasting him against Rich Mar-«
tin, and where he will have a
much better chance of winning.

Pitt has its best‘ chances for vic-
tory at 123 pounds with Martin,
137 pounds with Kelvington, from
Jim l‘~l.arrison, wherever he wres-
tles and from Jeﬁfries, if he does
not meet Rushatz. They would
need one more win to take tlie
match. ‘ E

Army Has Favorites

it will have to come from either
Kelvington: or 130 pounder Sherm
Moyer, Army rates heavy favorites
at 157 pounds, heavyweight and
the category Rushatz wrestles in.

Kelvington’s match against
Natvig will be the highlight of
the meet since it will probably
be the pivotal match besides
pitting the East’s best 147
pounders.

Natvig’s/two wins over Zolikoﬁ’
last year were of the sensational
variety. In dual meet competition
the Cadet was losing with ﬁve
seconds remaining when he pin-
ned the Panther. In the Eastern
tournament, Zolikoﬂ‘. led 4—1 going
into the ﬁnal period, when Natvig
tied the match and then won in
overtime.

It was Natvig’s Win that gave a
19-13 win last year.

Army, along with Pitt, Le-
high and Penn State, is rated
among the best in the East.
They do not have an exception-
ally strong tournament team,
but have enough good individ-
uals to make things troublesome
for anyone in a dual meet.

It will take a ﬁne performance
by the Panthers to bring home a
win, and if they do it could be the
advantage of the visiting team
that will make the difference.

forth, Ace spoke more like the
music maestro, Lawrence Welk.

“Amateur wrestling is as Von-
derful, vunderful sport,” be com-
mented in his Hungarian accent.
“This is a vunderful Pitt team,” he
further elaborated in Wolkian
style.

AWS By-law Structure

Scheduled for Revision

(Continued from Page 1)
laws will have the Executive
Power consist of elected ofﬁcers
and appointed committee chair-
men.

3) Under the previous sys-
tem, there was a Judiciary
Power, composed of ﬁve sen-
ior women, Senior Court, with
the president and vice-presi-
dent of AWS acting in ex-ofﬁ-
cio capacity. The new structure
calls for no judiciary power.

According to Mary Lou Karges,
current president of AWS, the past
Senior Court felt that the need
for a "judiciary was negligible.
Any problems requiring jurisdic-
tion are handled by Housing
Board or Panhellenic Council.
Miss Karges stated, “Because we
are not a ‘rules and regulations’
group, the nee_d for a judiciary
body is not existent.”

Deﬁnes Purpose

4.) There will be no class coun-
cils as in the past. Because of the
trimester system, “there is little‘
need for ‘class’ activities,” stated
the policy-makers.

5) Provisions for Housing
Board and Freshman Council
will be represented by elected
officers on the Executive Board.

The Executive Board and the
Council see the purpose and func-
tion of any student “governing or-
ganization to be a service and re-
presentative group, rather than a
regulating body. According to Miss
Karges, “We have found the pro-
posed structure to be an‘ efficient
means of representation, coordina-

student body. The rest remains.
It is a challenge to the student
body to set up the best possible
government for this University,
and any student with the Uni-
versity at heart would not vote
for dissolvement but rather con-
sider which of the two propo-
sals for reorganization is best.”

Fred Robie, director of Alumni
Activities, said that his office “is
very interested that SG exist, for
it is an important body in the
University.” _

Human Relations Discussed

In other areas, Bob Hepps re-
ported that the Human Relations

Committee discussed the scarcity

of Negro students on campus at
their last meeting.

Three possible reasons were
suggested: 1) Negroes have
preferred to leave Pittsburgh for
all-Negro schools; 2) they have
been discouraged by the raise
in tuition; and 3) they don’t see
Negroes in University activities,
partly because of the attitude
of the rest of the students.

   

ways of improving the situation.‘
First, state the University’s fair
housing policy. Secondly, have
Negro alumni go to high schools
to encourage qualiﬁed students to
apply. And ﬁnally establish better
relations through publications and
discussions in Freshman Men’s
Conferences and Women’s‘ Semi-
nars'. “Our human relations are
getting better, but they could be
improved,” Hepps concluded.
Sent to Rankin

The problem has already been
discussed with Bernard Adams,
special assistant to the Chancellor

and Earl Fielder, director of Stu-‘

dent Aid. The report will next
be given to Alan Rankin, vice
chancellor of Student Affairs.
Jay Fingeret announced that
Bernice Kimmel is the new
chairman of the Book Exchange
Committee for the coming tri-
mester. Applications are avail-
able to students for positions on
the committee. .
Rich Sobota reported that Irv-
ing Rothman, director of Student
Publications, Bernard Adams, Bob
Pannier, last “Polaris” editor, and

 
   

applications for the new”""‘Po-
laris” editor.

Bob Slotkin announced that
Rankin “felt we could be some-
what optimistic” about a work-
study lab. He also reported that
Edison J. Montgomery, vice chan-
cellor in charge of Institutional
Planning, was “enthusiastic.’

Fingeret announced the resig-
nations of Senators Bill Hale and
Jacques Wertheimer.’
er’s reason was “lack of time.”
