Pitt as students. _

These persons have passed the
required screening tests.

At present, the committee head-
ed by Edith L. Davis, chairman of
the campus DP committee, and
Edna T. Batz, executive secretary
of the YWCA, is planning hous-
ing accommodations for the for-
eign students. The overall plan is
to have them work full or part-
time for a year before continuing

their education if scholarships
are not available.

The expenses of the trip from

been the subject of continued
fraud-rumors and six ballot re-

Loyalty Bill Re turned 

,To House Committee

Opponents of the ‘loyalty oath’ bill got a breather this

week when, as a result of a

hearing with the state's four ,-

leading educators, the legislators sent Senate Bill 27 back
to committee for further study and amendment.

This action, supported by Sen-0 * It I

ate and House leaders, the At-
torney-General, the chairman of
the House committee studying the
bill, and the sponsor of the bill
himself, left the legislators two
possible choices:

1. They can amend the bill so
as to remove the parts objected
to by educators.

2. They can allow it to die in
committee.

The about-face of the legisla-
tors, who had previously refused
even to grant public hearings on
the bill, came as the result of ar-
guments presented by the heads
of the state's four major univer-
sities Monday, particularly Penn

‘Desperado’ Hides Out H ere

Horace Rambler, sheriff of Bone
Crush County, Arizona, announced
to the‘ Spring Festival Committee
that his deputies have discovered
the whereabouts of the criminal
that escaped from the Bone Crush
County jail recently.

Rambler’s deputies investigated
the case thoroughly and are now
certain that the desperado is dis-
guising himself as a Pitt student.
They are also sure that he is work-
ing on one of the three student
publications.

The Spring Festival committee
and Rambler’s deputies have de-

cided to capture the criminal to-
day. They have made a study of
his habits and are sure that they
will be able to ﬁnd him this after-
noon at 1:30 p.m. drinking coffee
in the Blue Tuck Shop.

This man is wanted for stage
coach robbery, blackmail, poison-
ing his nursemaid, and for writing
poison pen letters. .

The criminal had been sen-
tenced to hang when he broke out
of jail last month. As soon as the
posse catches him, they’re going to
carry out the sentence and hang
him on the Cathedral lawn.

First Time in Last Six Years

When Pitt honors its stu-

  New Congress President
Is Old Hand at Politics

By ED

 

JENSEN

Assistant Editor

Cyril Wecht, newly-elected Student Congress President,
h an old hand at heading student organizations.
year-old junior in the college has served either as president
or chairman of over nine organizations since he came to Pitt.

His record here reads some-O

thing like a “who’s who” list ex-
cept that he‘s the only person on
the list. Elected president of
YMCA for next year, he is also
president of Druids, honorary
sophomore and junior fraternity;
president of Phi Epsilon Pi, social
fraternity and president of The
University Orchestra.
Had Small Jobs Too

A little lower in the hierarchy,
but just as important, Wecht has
served as assistant manager of
-Men’s Debate, assistant business
manager of Pitt Players, and as-
sistant advertising manager of the

A Pitt News. He was also in charge
of this year’s Scho1ar’s Day cere-
monies in Foster Memorial, and
last summer he was a counsellor

’ at freshman camp,

As Wecht’s record seems to in-
dicate, he is more than just a ca-
pable campus politician. Last fall
he branched into bigtime politics

_ and managed the ‘Students for
Myers and Dilworth’ campaign in
the ﬁve colleges of the Pittsburgh
district. The campaign failed to
put Myers and Dilworth in ofﬁce
but it did give Wecht a lot of po-
litical know-how.

Vagabond Education

Unlike most students Wecht has
not conﬁned his education within
the four high walls of the campus.
One of the crack men on Men’s
Debate, Wecht has toured the mid-

” western and eastern part of the
United States.

Recently he returned from Chi-
eago where he attended, with the
‘rest of the debators, the Delta
Sigma Rho Congress. Out in Chica-
go Wecht made a pretty good

_ showing as a Democrat in debat-
ing national and international is-§

sues.
Debators Back Truman
Wecht reports that the nation’s
debators went down the line with
the Truman administration when
the ﬁnal showdown came. They
_ gave the president their support
on the ﬁring of General Mac-
.Arthur.
The convention had been divid-

- From the end of last year until. late in March the Owl

staff was laboring with one eye on their work and the other
on circled days on the calendar. In addition to this they were
carrying fulltime scholastic schedules.

 Lagging sales early in the year made it appear for a
time unlikely that any Owl would appear at all. Under such
a demoralizing thought as this, they continued plugging
away. ‘We are glad they stayed on the job. If you ordered
an Owl, we feel certain that you will also be glad.

ur news story on the Commons Room senior dance
last week led off with the statement that this year’s dance

, will be unique in two ways. First of all, the story said, it

will be in the Commons Room. And, the story_ continued,
invitations will be sent out this year.

We have thought of another reason which we feel makes

1 iiteven more unique. This other peculiarity is the price: $4.50.

’We do not mean that it is unique in these days of soaring

_ ‘costs, but we do feel that it is unique in light of all the

arguments for holding a dance in the Commons Room.

One of the chief arguments for holding such a dance
there was that it would save money.‘ The promoters reasoned
‘that much of the money spent on dances went into renting
a place to hold them. '

They felt that if we could hold_major dances ‘underneath
good in a ﬁnancial sense.
Their reasoning seemed to be sound. ’

But somewhere along the line they seem to have thrown
over their objectives and decided to make money. For even
though Claude Thornhill is a big name ‘band, he certainly
is no Harry James. He shouldn’t come so high. _

At four ﬁfty per, this should be a pretty good dance.

Wish we had the dough to go.

bill in the newspapers for the next couple of weeks, that bill

If we are to prevent this measure from coming, out of

should also study the possibilities of drawing up an alter-

 vested interests or disloyalty.

Chancellor Fitzgerald’s testimony, elsewhere on this

In The Spring ‘

ED JENSEN 

_ If you doubt that spring is here to stay, don’t strain
your eyes studying the almanacs or looking for robins. Just
stroll down Varsity Walk towards Heinz Chapel, all of the
time glancing both to your right and left. You will there
on the green ‘grass of the campus see the most convincing

signs that the spring of the year is here to stay.

On your right, facing Forbes,
you’ll see proof positive that Ten-
nyson’s theory about the fancies
turning has withstood. the rigors
of the Industrial Revolution and
is carrying on info the Atomic
Age. You may also conclude that
this theory has been extended to
the female of the species, who
seem to have embraced it with
vigor, especially the educated
variety.

Goes on all the time

As an aside I question the theory
on the grounds that it is too re-
strictive. I hold that young men's
fancies turn" both lightly and
heavily in all four seasons. It is
only in the spring that we can ob-
serve overt expression of those
who don’t have cars. In the poet’s
day he saw only those who didn’t
have carriages. .

Let us pass on to more weighty
subjects, or rather, let us give our
attention to the other side of the
Walk. There you will see another
sign of spring. But at this sign you
will either laugh or cringe.

For there, marching up and
down, and backward and forward,
you will see the ROTC boys train-
ing to make the world safe for
something or the other. ‘Every
year at this time they come out
of their classrooms and practice
at the -rudimentary arts of the
soldier. .

There's Still Hope

An old familiar sight

I imagine that the sight of
marching soldiers is one that al-
most every citizen of the world in
every century has seen at one
time or another in his life. I feel
conﬁdent that almost everyone
who has seen’ them at ﬁrst gets a
momentary thrill out of their pre-
cise movements.

But this thrill must inevitably
be followed by _a slight sinking of
the heart. When soldiers are
marching it is not only a sign that
spring is here, but it is a signiﬁ-
cant indication that”war is not too
far over the horizon. Soldiers have
few other reasons for existence
than wars.

‘ A couple of years ago we used to
rush out onto the lawn to watch
the ROTC boys at work. It was
a show well worth watching. You

could see movements you never;

dreamed possible.

The platoon leader would order
his men to doa right ﬂank. He got
f o u r different interpretations.
Some ROTC men, probably’ ma-
joring in political science,.. felt
that right shoulder arms should
be interpreted as actually ‘mean-
ing left ‘shoulder arms.

lndividualists in ranks

There were individualists who
refused to do left ﬂank movements
when the rest of the platoon did

I.

so. They continued marching
straight ahead. Once I saw a plat-

toon leader march his men right’:
up to the shrubbery on Fifth Ave-

nue. He was stuck there for ﬁve
minutes trying to ﬁgure how to
face them the other way.

They put on a good show. Ev--
eryone got a lot of laughts out of
it, including the ROTC boys them- .
selves. Most of them had joined
for the 27 bucks a month or be- ,.
cause they wanted to stay out_o£_
the draft, then a not so serious ’
matter. Some few of them were. 5
vets who decided that if they were‘, ,
ever going to ﬁght another war,
they’d rather do it as commission- 9
ed gentlemen.

ROTC serious business _

Now, however, the ROTC is 
serious business, All of those 
out there have a godd chance off
some day marching in grass not so 3
soft and green. Some of them may 1
be in Korea by the end of the 5
year. . V e "V

This takes some of the joy out of”;
spring. For even if they don’t havejk,
to ﬁght a war, they are all getting‘-1:5-j.i
military training which is the ﬁrst,
prerequisite for a strong feeling at
militarism. If we continue to have"
crises, we will continue to_ train, agy,
lot of potential generals. Where
there is an overabundance of geng-1,3:
erals there is always the chance
that they will form into political?!
groups, as they have in Southﬁ
America. 

If this should be the result, Weill 
one day wish that there had been?
activity only on one side of Varofg
sity Walk. 

   

LOIS 

 
 

It seems to me that there is more interest in

at Pitt than meets the eye.

civil rights

There was a brief ﬂurry not long ago when the Pennsyl-

vania Senate ﬁrst passed the Loyalty Oath bill, but rufﬂed

feathers have pretty’ well been smoothed. Chancellor Fitz-
gerald’s purposeful visit to Har-9

risburg early this week has help-
ed to avert the danger educators
feel such an oath: would have.

All Have Opinion

But while debate and discus--

sion was reaching a peak here,
everyone had an opinion. Not all
were well-informed; not all were
“enlightened” in the eyes of their
friends, but there were few in-
deed who were not interested in
the question.

There was another brief but
vitriolic ﬂurry when Pitt News
columnist Jack Markowitz made
his bombshell stand backing the
right of anyone, communists in-
cluded, to teach on the college
level. »

There were letters in the ofﬁce
that burned at the touch, and
there were some of praise. Either

way they showed that students
had more than book—larnin’ in
their heads and were split up, as
they have every right to do, on
controversial issues. 1
Students Not Buckets

All of which may give pause to
one such as Professor Oscar Hand-
lin of Harvard, who cried from the
pages of the Atlantic Monthly not
long ago that college students to-
day were ruled by conformity—
willing to sit back and let their
professors ﬁll them up with what-
ever they wanted to pour in.

The testimony of Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald in Har-
risburg Monday was instrumental in having the loyalty oath
bill returned to committee for further study. Believing that
this bill is"of paramount importance both to students and
faculty, the Pitt News has recorded the chancellor’s state-

ment in full, as follows:
1. The faculties of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh are in accord

' with the desire of the sponsors of

Senate Bill 27 to prevent the
spread of Communism everywhere
including institutions of higher
learning. They have stated their
willingness to subscribe to an oath
to support and defend the Consti-
tution of the United States and of
the Commonwealth.

2. Under existing law, State
aided educational institutions are
prohibited from employing persons
who advocate subversive doc-
trines. In 1941, the Legislature of
the Commonwealth passed a law
prohibiting such employment and
provided a means for dismissing
employees who advocate such doc-
trines. (Act No. 214, Sessions of
1941.) »

3. Senate Bill 27 is not pri-
marily a loyalty oath bill. The ap-
parent purpose of the bill is to

1 .

require the dismissal of persons
belonging to, or afﬁliated, with or-
ganizations declared by the Attor-
ney-General to be sudversive. The
wide discretion vested in the At-
torney-General would make it
possible for him to exercise con-
trol over research and teaching in
universities. If this power were
improperly exercised, it would do
irreparable damage to higher ed-
ucation in this Commonwealth.

Where an oath similar to that
prescribed by Senate Bill 27 has
been required, institutions have
experienced serious losses in per-
sonnel and in academic standing.
On the basis of experience else-
where it is possible that many
highly competent educators of un-
questioned loyalty will leave the
institutions of this Commonwealth
and goto other states. .

In addition to the above, the

.{mora1e of the faculty may suffer if

the oath is required, since. facultyli
members may fear the loss of theitréﬁl
positions if they engage is in that
explanation of political, social anciiiéi
economic subjects, even thoughf}

  

‘they do not advocate or teach sub-7,.

versive doctrines. ~‘ ..

4. Since the proposed oath is“
required of all employees it would vi
probably make it impossible for-:
the University to hire visiting pro-
fessors from other countries since?
they would not be able to take 
oath without endangering theﬂ
citizenship in their native lands.
If this were to occur, our students
might be deprived of important
educational advantages.

5. It is suggested that ample“
legal authority for preventing the
advocacy of subversive doctrine:
in State aided institutions now ex-
ists under the Act’of 1941. It h‘
doubtful if the requirement of an
oath would have any beneﬁcial ek-
fect. If an oath is to be required,
however, it would seem desirablij
to provide for it through the
amendment to the Act of 1941 anti “
to confine it as closely as possible".
to the terms of the oath requireﬁj‘,
by the Constitution. . j ._-if

6 Busy Week

Ahead for
Pitt Netters

By DAVE LIPMAN
Sports Writer

Today is “T” day.

The Panther netmen, direct
from their third straight
defeat, will play their ﬁrst
home tennis match of the
season this afternoon against
West Virginia at 3 p.m. on the
Mellon Courts.

The racqueteers face _a busy
week, as they meet Westminster
on Monday, Gettysburg on Tues-
day, Geneva next Friday, and
Notre Dame on Saturday, May 12.
All these battles will take place

' ._ on the Mellon courts.

Their third loss in a row, which
found them winning only the
ﬁnal doubles match of the after-
noon, came at the hands of un-
defeated Navy, 8-1, on Wednes-

day at Annapolis.

Only One Score

The doubles combination of

 , Jack Roof and Bob Ilisevich post-

ed the only score for the Panthers
as they won, 9-7 and 6-1..
Harry Campney and Bob Ili-
sevich both went into action with
3-0 singles match records and
they both came out with their
first losses of the season.
Slumping ace Johnny Lohstoeter
lost for the second time this sea-
son. It was his worst showing in
four matches as he lost 6-0, 6-1.
He has two victories,
Lohstoeter_seems to be running
hot and cold. He won his ﬁrst and

third matches and lost the second

and fourth.

Doubles Team Loses
The unbeaten doubles combina-

tion of Campney and Lohstoeter

lost for the ﬁrst time in four
matches as they were defeated

P f 6-2,’ 7-5.

Campney, with a 3-1 record, has
played in the number one spot in
the last two matches in an at-
tempt to allow Lohstoeter to re-
gain his 1950 form.

Ilisevich, also with a 3-1 rec-
ord, has been the only other bright
spot in the dismal net season thus
far.

Joe Sclzmidt’s 
T 0 Guard Pays Off

By

DON MURDOCK

Sports Writer
The day of the sixty—minute football player is supposed
to be gone, but Pitt could very easily have one on next

year’s squad.

He’s Joe Schmidt, and what’s more he likes the idea.

Under present plans Joe is slated¢
for the offensive guard position
and the defensive fullback post.

“I like both positions, says
Schmidt, “although line backing
is my ﬁrst love since I played
that position in high school.”

Schmidt Cited

Coach Len Casanova calls
Schmidt a real football player
who is willing to try anything.

“He has done very well at the
new position,” says Casanova.
And it seems he has, since he has
already advanced to the ﬁrst

Sports Shorts

Pitt’s football team left for Olean, N. Y. this morning for a
practice game with St. Bonaventure tomorrow afternoon.

Coach Len Casanova will use Chris Warriner and Dick Dietrich
at end; Charley Yost or Bill Gasparovic and Bob Brennen at tackle;
Rudy Andabaker and Tony Ro—O

mantino or Joe Schmidt at guard;
and John Dazio at center.

In the backﬁeld it will be Bobby
Bestwick at quarterback, Billy
Reynolds at right half; Jim Camp-
bell at left half; and Joe Capp at
fullback.

Gasparovic may miss to-
morrow’s game because of a
broken nose received in prac-
tice this week. If Bill is un-
able to play, Yost will move
from defensive tackle to of-
fensive tackle.

Undefeated in two years, the
Pitt News softball team is chal-
lenging any softball team in the
University--male or fema1e—to a

This will be the ﬁrst competi-

Schmidt, a 19-year-old sopho-
more from Brentwood, played
fullback defensively and offen-
sively for two years while in high
school.

Fills Bill

When he came to Pitt in the
days of Mike Milligan’s single
wing, he was switched to block-
ing back. But when Casanova in-
stalled the T at Pitt last year,
Schmidt was moved back to his
old haunt at fullback.

This spring when graduation
losses depleted the guard ‘posi-
tion, Casanova called upon the
200—pound Schmidt to ﬁll in.

Schmidt's done more than just,

ﬁll the bill, he’s moved right into
a starting role. -

Pitt football fans will get a
chance to see Schmidt in his
double role on Saturday, May 12,
when the varsity gets its ﬁrst test
of the year against Mike Boldin’s
Old-Timers.

Boldin and Coach John Chickerneo today announced the
list of players upon whom will fall the burden of the Old-
Timers play. All have been active within the past two

seasons.

Latest to join the team is end
Leo Skladany of the 1948 team
who has been with the Philadel-
phia Eagles since leaving Pitt.
Boldin expects other former Pitt
players to be in the fold by game
time.

Ends Star-Studded

Quite an array of ends will be
in old-timer uniforms. In addi-
tion to Skladany, Bill McPeak of
the Steelers, Nick DeRosa, Ted
Geremsky, Earl Sumpter, John
Masarik, and Harry Hollihan are
all ready to go.

At the tackles, Chickerneo will
have ﬁve veterans from the 1950
team. .They are Nick Bolkovac,
place-kicking specialist, Flint
Greene, Bob Mihm, Sam DeFede,
and John Stoken.

The guards, besides Boldin, will
be Don Karanovich and Larry
Pierce,‘ while George Radosevich
will do iron-man duty at center.

Eight Backs Ready

In the backﬁeld, recent stars
Bobby Lee and Jimmy Joe Robin-
son will be backed up by Lindy
Lauro, Walt Cummins, Bill Abra-
ham, ace punter Bill Hardisty,
Fred Botti, and Joe O’Bara.

Besides these regulars, several
Pitt gridders of the last decade
have expressed willingness to
play. Clipper Clougherty, center,
and Jack Duvishan, tackle, of the
1946 team will play, as will Emil
Naric, crack forward passer from
the 1939 squad, Joe Connell, half-
back of 1941, and Steve Polach,
1945 guard.

Panthers Win
Two at Navy

Pitt surprised by taking two out
of the three sports contests from
Navy at Annapolis on Wednesday.

The baseballers’ 9-3 victory and
the golfers’ 4-3 win were the ﬁrst

teams. . _

Navy's 8-1 tennis triumph pre-
vented a clean sweep for the day
by the Panthers.

The biggest surprise was the
baseball victory, as Ralph Mit-
terling’s mittmen snapped out of
their hitting doldrums to blast
Navy hurlers for 15 hits.

Leading the Panther hitting at-
tack was Catcher Ollie Niemela
with four hits in six trips. He is
now hitting at a terriﬁc .562 pace.

BY WILL DOERGE
b Sports Editor
1 There’s one thing you can say for this year’s Pitt base-

ball team. Even though they look like the East Overshoe

Scorpions in the ﬁeld, they are setting some sort of a home

attendance record.

Ralph Mitter1ing—better known as “Screaminmad”—and
his mittmen are drawing more crowds than ever before. The
word “crowds” is used advisedly, but nevertheless, there

have been more spectators at Pittﬂ

games thus far this season than
there have been in recent years.

The mittmen have certainly
pulled an ‘el foldo’ this season.
High hopes were held for this
year’s crop of baseballers before
the season opened. But unfortu-
nately, they have proved them-
selves to be a bunch of subpar

please pardon.)
Infielders Play Out-field

The three men in Pitt uniforms;

who have been

Pat Murphy is in reality a ﬁrst

Dick Mcshannic are misplaced in-
ﬁelders. Mcshannic recently gave
up the ghost and quit the team.

And all the while the old Sarge

L..- ......4.‘

Softball Re».-~ - 

(Bushleaguers

keeps stumbling along trying to
do the best with what he has_
Better Players Here

Certainly there are better
ballplayers at the University
than those Mitterling has in
uniform. Offhand I can think
of two outﬁelders and two
inﬁelders at Pitt who are
heads above anything Mitter-
ling is using.

But as, long as Mitterling
doesn’t seem to know what
to look for in a player, those
four and many others want
no part of the Pitt team.

The old Sarge has a one-track
mind when it comes to picking a
team. If a player hits like a
demon in practice, he’s in.

The Mitterling Way

Speed, ﬁelding ability, and com-
petitive spirit are apparently un-
known qualities to Mitterling.
And the 1951 Pitt nine reﬂects the
Mitterling way.

They can't run, they can't field,
and they seem to lack competitive
spirit. And what do you know,
up to the Navy game, they weren't
hitting either.

Maybe you can’t blame
them for not wanting to die
for dear old Pittsburgh, be-
cause who cares a plug nickel
for college baseball, anyhow.

  PiKA’s, Phi Eps Win Again,

Tied for Frat Section Lead

A high-powered PiKA nine extended their unbeaten
streak to four games as they easily vanquished Sigma Alpha
Mu, 11-4, at Ellsworth Center, Wednesday evening.

The victory enabled the PiKA’s to keep pace with the

Phi Eps, who ‘squeaked’ by the
Sig Eps, 32-2. The two teams are
tied for ﬁrst place in Section 1 of
the Fraternity League, both hav-
ing charts of 4-0.

The PiKA—SAM game was
closely contested for four innings,
but the PiKA’s gradually pulled
away with timely base hits, as-
sisted by costly SAM errors.

Sigma Chi Stopped

In other games Monday, Sigma
Chi’s unbeaten streak was snap-
ped when a power-laden Phi Gam
team outlasted them, 16-8. Home
runs by Dal Bottles, Bob Andres,
and Bob Rink were not enough to
help the Sig cause, as the Phi Gams
touched pitcher Ralph Henry for
17 hits.

George Miller helped the Gams
along by contributing four timely
singles. -

The Phi Gams now hold exclu-
sive possession of ﬁrst place in
Section 3 with a 4-0 record.

In Section 2 action, the Lambda
Chi’s continued their winning
ways by knocking off the Phi
Delts, 6-2. They now have a 3-1
record. and trail league-leading

PITT GOES WEST

Spring F estival—I 951

Thinclads Eye Ist Win’

Against Ohio ’sBo bcats

By DON SCHURMAN
Sports Writer

Nothing less than a complete reversal of form can keep
the Panther thinclads from notching their first win when
they tangle with the Ohio Bobcats at Athens, Ohio tomorrow.

In Pitt’s only meet so far this year, they were upset
by the Miami Redskins, Mid-American Conference brothers
of Ohio, 61% to 60%.

Interest in the meet will be centered around
individual performers. Co-captaiu¢
Bob Arthurs has his sights set on
Pitt’s all-time discus record. In
the Miami meet, he came within
ﬁve feet of the record.

Firsching Injured

In the pole vault, Al -Yedlicka
will be out to hit the 13 foot
mark. At the Penn Relays last
Saturday, Yedlicka missed it, by
the skin of his arm. His elbow
knocked over the crossbar. _

One dark spot mars the Pitt
starting lineup. That is the ab-
sence of Co-captain Dick Firsch-
ing. Firsching pulled a leg while
competing in the Penn Relays.
The seriousness of the injury has
not been determined as yet.

Pitt’s weakest link, the sprints,
will not be so evident tomorrow.
Norm Kutcher, lamed at the start
of the season, has been working _
out all week and is expected to 
return to the sprints.

Ohio Has Five Meets

Then too, Ohio is comparatively
weak in the sprints. In fact, Ohio’s
only strong point is in the hur-
dles. There they have letterman
Dave Koester, who has hit 15.1 in
the highs.

Ohio has the advantage of hav-
ing already run ﬁve meets, more
than Pitt’s whole schedule calls
for. Besides, they still remember
last year’s 971/2-241/2 drubbing by
Pitt.

When it was mentioned that
this meet may turn out to be just
practice for the Notre Dame meet

Juniata Next
For Mittmen

An overdue shot in the arm will
be administered to the Pitt base-
ball team this weekend when the
Panthers face two opponents in
their own class. -

After upsetting Navy for their
third victory of the season Wed-
nesday afternoon, the Panthers
face Juniata College at Hunting-
ton tomorrow and then return to
Schenley Oval Monday to enter-
tain Bethany College.

Monday’s game will begin at
3:30 p.m.

Coach Ralph Mitterling’s team
has the opportunity to fatten their
lean 3-6 record against easier op-
position. Whether the Panthers
can take advantage of this oppor-
tunity remains to be seen.

Mitterling will have regulars
Bob Russell and Ray Hollis ready
for mound duty for the two games.
Russell and Hollis own the two
Pitt victories.

Dick Mcshannic, senior out-'
ﬁelder, quit the team this week
to play for McDonald in the Great-
er Pittsburgh League. Mcshannic
was hitting .235 for the mittmen
and had appeared as a regular in
eight games..

Lil Russell Too

Another Lil will also be in the
show. This time it will be the girl
with the hour—glass ﬁgure, Lillian
Russell. Miss Russell, who was
toasted and courted throughout
the United States, will also be por-
trayed by a Pitt student, whose
name has not yet been announced.

Although most Pitt students can
remember the famous playwright
and composer George M. Cohan,
they'll need the help of parents in
recalling the Four Cohans, of
which George was a member. The
Four Cohans, popular as a single
act in the Nineties, will be por-
trayed in the show by Sue Del-
phey, Jerome Myer, Jay Garber,
and Jerry Alpern.

The traditional b a r b e r s h o p
quartette will harmonize for the
beneﬁt of the audience, and soft-
shoe dancers will do a little walk-
ing to rhythm.

Grads in Show

This show will also feature two
graduate students at Pitt, Natalie
Gefsky and Cecile Bodman.

Most of the specialty acts take
place in the second act, in Big
Mike's Bowery Beer Garden
where the heroine's search for her
sister takes her. However a few
of the numbers will be presented
between acts to provide further
entertainment for the audience.
