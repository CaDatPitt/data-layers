  ‘ Dr. Salk Announces

“Effective Vaccine”

The drive to conquer [infantile paralysis took an im-~

portant! step forward last night.
‘A Pitt researcher said that ﬁrst experiments with a 5

polio vaccine shows that it can produce eﬁective anti—bodies
against all three types ‘of polio virus. .

Dr; Jonas E. Salk, head of_the virus research laboratory
here, made the announcement from New York over a nation-;
wide radio hookup at 10:45 p.m. .

Dr. Salk pointedly warned against over-enthusiasm at
the announcement. - . _ . . -
‘> ‘ The results, he said_, are “encouraging, but they should
not be interpreted to indicate,that a practical vaccine is now"

The ability bf the vaccine to imrnunize humans against
polio has not been conclusively proven, Dr. Salk said.

The Vaccine. produces anti—bodies which should ’ﬁght__off in A

polio, heiasserted, but no human has yet been.infec_te“d with

"polio virus after vaccination with the new vaccine to deter-

mine whther he reallyis immune. '

He added, however, that this method has been used to

ishowvthat resistence to the disease may‘ be induced in ~
'monkeys. '

Dr.- Salk, whose research has been carried out under
substantial grants from the National Polio Foundation, has
written an exhaustive report on the vaccine in the current

issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Here is the full -textof the ann‘ouncement'made.by“ him
over the air last night: ' I

‘~‘l‘here will‘ appear in the March 28 issue of the -Journal of the ~

American Medical Assdciation, a preliminary report of’-.studiesVth_at
are in progress in human subjects on vaccination against Poliomy’elitis.
This topic-*has, in recent months been featured prominently in the-
News, and there has been much speculation, varying from cautious
optimism to deﬁnite conclusion. For this reason I welcomed the
opportunity, at the time of making our report,i‘to speak to you di-
rectly to make clear the facts,‘ so that they may not be misunder-
stood nor misconstrued. 1+ know many of the questions that are, in
your mind, and I shall -try to answer some of them in the brief
time available. , _ .
I would like ﬁrst to place before you the fundamentals of the
progress that has been made over the years,.by many investigators,

‘before it was ‘possible, to consider realistically the step that was

taken some months ago, when a series-of experiments were initiated,
‘involving the innoculation of -experimental Poliomyelitis vaccines
into more than 160 children and young adults.

__ It isinecessary that you understand the basic facts and the his-

torical background' of the problem, because some twenty years ago ‘

several thousand children were vaccinated against this disease in
attempts that in restrospect were premature and, for this reason
had to‘ be discontinued._ Since those ﬁrst attempts, that were made
in the mid 1-930’s, progress has been slow because much had to
be learned and techniques had to be developed. Later, when _pro-
gress could be made more rapidly, it was necessary to undo the fear
created by the outcome of the ﬁrst experience and to re-establish
conﬁdence that new efforts could be made safely and with reasonable
expectation of success. A ,

, Before I am through, it will be abundantly “ clear to you that
the progress that has been in recentyears, and whichlwill continue
into the future, is not merely a collection of haphazard incidents,
but rather a series of episodes that ﬁt together in an orderly man-
ner. Although contributed by many investigators in many labora-
tories, each represents aicomponent part within a logical scheme.
In this way,- a solid foundation has been built, and it is on this
foundation that present and future developments will be made.

I shall begin this brief story with the year 1909, when monkeys
were inoculated with material from a patient with infantile paralysis.

For the ﬁrst time this disease was reproduced in an experimental

A Research Gains Ground

  iln Fight “Against Polio:

animal. ‘The microbe that caused the paralyzing affliction was so '

smallvthat it could not be seen under the ordinary microscope,_ nor
could it be made to multiply outside of the living animal. This ‘re-
-vealed that the causative agent of Poliomyelitis belongs to the group
of disease producing organisms known as viruses. I Q‘
It was not until more than twenty years" later, in 1931, tlfat
evidence‘ was first introduced suggesting" that polio could be
.caused by more than one virus. It required almost another
twenty years ‘before substantial evidence was brought forth in-
dicating that three different types of this virus were capable of
causing the identical disease. A systematic study, which was .
completed in ‘1951, revealed the probability that not more than
three ‘types of Poliomyelitis virus exist. I
I should like to explain what we mean by. three types of polio
virus. First, I should say that all(three polio viruses are similar, -in
that they are all able’ to produce the paralytic. disease. The dif-
-ference between them lies in the fact that each will immunize only
‘ again_st..viruses of the same type but_ not against either of the other
two_' types. For example, it has been shown that monkeys can be
paralyzed repeatedly, if the virus_ inoculated each time is of a dif-

‘ ferent type. A~person who may have experienced either a paralytic ‘

or a non-paralytic infection due to any one of the three virus types
_will thereafter be immune only to a virus of the same type. But
T ‘ later in life he may become ‘paralyzed when exposed to either of
I the two remaining types of this virus. ' _ '
T _  This is the reason why two paralytic attacks can occur in
- _. the same individual, and it is also the reason why Poliomyelitis
can occur in older persons who may have in the past been ex-
. posed to one_ or two types, but not all three. Therefore, for
f complete immunity to the paralytic disease, it is necessary that
there be immunity to all three‘ types of the-virus. r _
Along with the elucidation of this very important fact ther'e"Iiave
emerged several other signiﬁcant developments, each of which repre-
sents, a basic prerequisite for the development of an effective means
‘for preventing this disease. One such development was the discovery
- ‘ that the polio virus, which gains access to the body through the

_ﬂ-mouth or through the nose, may then be transported ‘to the vital

to

nerve centers by means of the circulating blood. It was soon found
that the blood serum of animals or of man, after recovery‘ from
an‘ attack of the disease, contains a substance called antibody which
when injected, at the proper time, into a susceptible animal, can
prevent virus of the same type from reaching _ the cells of the
A spinal cordoand brain. I ‘ '
A The "prevention of paralysis in this way was first demonstrated
in laboratory animals. '1_‘hen, during-this past summer, it was shown
_ that resistance, , to the naturally occurring disease‘ could be con-
‘ ferred upon children, for a brief period of time, by the injection of
_ protective antibodies contained in" the gamma globulin fraction from
‘ human’blood. O - . _
_ From these observations, and many others, it isclear that Polio-
\myeli_tis is really not different from other diseases which have in the
past been controlled by vaccination. Theoretically a vaccine should be
effective for preventing polio if the vaccine can induce the forma-
tion of the protective substances that are known as antibodies. It
is 4‘. essenti-pal,’ too, that these protective substances, once developed,
will last for a sufficient period of time or be capable of being re-
inforced at reasonable intervals. Above all, it is necessaryéthat the
-protective antibodes be induced against each of the three virus types
capable of causing the~human disease.
The principle of vaccination is not difficult to’ understand. A
vaccine is made of the virus that causes "the disease. When the vac-
, cine is injected the body reacts with the formation of antibodies.
These antibodies are found in the blood and remain to defend against
future attacks. -It is evident, of course, that the virus contained in
the vaccine must be rendered\harmless so that when injected it
. will not cause disease,.but will result only in the formation of pro-
tective. antibodies. r O
For preparing such a vaccine there must be an adequate supply
of the viruses from which the vaccine is, to be made. Prior to
four years ago, the only source of virus for such purposes was the
spinal cord of paralyzed monkeys. Then Dr. John F. Enders and his
associates in Boston, made the very signiﬁcant discovery that all

’ three types of Poliomyelitis virus could be propagated in test tubes \

‘containing living tissue. This may be a new concept to you—that

small bits of certain human or other animal tissues" can live in a

test tube. Such living tissues, like the animals from ,which they

5 are derived, can be infected with the polio virus. Upon,this prin-

. ciple‘ is based the development of methods for deriving the raw

~ . materials for a vaccinein quantities that can now be prepared with-
out practical limitations, using tissues derived from ~monkeys.

The next problem was to convert these raw materials, which.

are themselves potentially hazardous, into a harmless but yet ef-
fective immunizing agent. This is possible by chemical treatment

of the virus in the ﬂuid derived from the tissue culture tube. For, -

‘enhancing the antibody producing power of the virus another pro-
cedure was employed, which involves the mixing of the virus with
‘mineral oil to form a creamy mixture. Before combination with
mineral. oil couldbe considered for improving the immunizing effect
‘_ of an experimental Poliomyelitis vaccine, it had to be ‘established
that undersirable side-effects would not occur. Fortunately for the
Poliomyelitis problem this had already been accomplished in con-
nection with studies we had carried out in an effort to develop a
more effective vaccine for inﬂuenza for the armed forces. '1
With these prerequisites for a Poliomyelitis vaccine ‘available,
' tests were ﬁrst made in monkeys. These were then extended, and in
I the studies which are now being reported, it_has been shown that
an experimental vaccine, that appears to be safe, is capable of in/-_
ducing in human subjects antibody formation to all three types of
‘the Poliomyelitis virus. These experiments are still in progress and
many are quite incomplete. Nevertheless it is possible "to. say from
.the one experiment that has been underway‘ longer than any other,

'  that -antibody formation resulting from. vaccination has persisted

 

for atleast four and

Men’s Council Decides To Let
Point Scale System ‘Ride’

The in again, out again point scale system is out again

During. an executive committee report, Mort Goldstein,
MC vice—pre_sident, said that the committee has chosen to
let the point scale “ride”'until the new MC is elected next

semester. Goldstein added thaté

any voting would come too close
to the student elections which are
held in April, and, he said, the
students would not be oriented
enough to vote on such a system.

. Mel Forst proposed, during the

closing minutes of the meeting,

that MC “forget the point scale
system completely.” Other coun-

as dear old Pitt. \\

Up to now most of this assist-
ance by Business has been di-
rected toward developing facili-
ties for training specialists and
advancing research directly ap-
plicable or
ness.' "
New Trend _
' But a new trend appears to be
setting in. For example, we have
Mr. Robert R. ¥oung, Chair-
man of the Chesapeake and«Ohio

,Railway, who made a speech re-' "

cently, advocating that Business
take a hand in aiding the liberal
arts colleges, which, he says, are
facing a ﬁnancialcrisis. .

Brieﬂy, hestates the case this
way:, I S

1) One ‘of the chief functions '

of a liberal arts education is to
teach us how to live rich, satis-
fying lives, as’ opposed to utili-
tarian training by which we
learn only how to. put bread in
our mouths. , V

2) Business suffers from hav-
ing too many executives who do
not know how to enjoy life, who
can’t play or relax, whose lives,
if theirbusiness duties were to
be taken away, .would be barren
and dull, wholincapacitate them-
selves through overwork, and
who even literally work them-
selves to death. ‘

3) With.1abor—saving machines
providing everyone in general
with more free time, the de-
mands on our educational. insti-
tutions toteach us what to do

with that time are becoming in-'

creasingly. great. If liberal arts
colleges cannot meet this demand
.there is a danger that the mass
of people will turn away from
liberal arts and higher education

completely, depend on Business

to provide the utilitarian train-
ingvnecessary tomake a living,
and seek’ the solution -to the
problem of spare time elsewhere.

The overall effect of this.wou_ld .

i be to lower the calibre _of young
people hired, by Business to do
its work, and incidentally, pro-
duce more executives susceptible
to point number two stated

The most‘ delightful thing about
the Alldred room, though, is the

These books are meant for the

Makes Suggestions
In light‘of all this, says Mr

‘Young, it behooves Business to
_see to it that liberal arts insti- .
"tutions the country over are ade-

quately provided for, both from
a ﬁnancial and an administra-
tive viewpoint, and he makes
several recommendations for
putting his suggestions into ef-

' fect.
All of which is fine, and I

heartily approve.

But, there is more to this than
meets the eye.

A liberal arts education teach-
es,‘ or purports to teach, that
man_does no.t live by bread alone.‘
Once that lesson is gotten across,
it then tries to show us, ﬁgura-
tively, where the jam is kept, and
how to spread it on. In a cul-
ture thoroughly diffused with
students well versed in the liber-
al arts truth, beauty, and integ-

rity, an increasing awareness of ‘

the richness of life, in short, an
orientation toward the concept
of the “good life,” would be in
the ascendancy.

Decline Certain

‘In fact, if this diﬁusion were

a to become as thorough going as
' Mr. Young would have it be-

come, Business, by comparison,

"will inevitably suffer a decline

in political power and social
status. The day may even come
when businessmen will feel the
sting of ridicule now directed at
scholars and_ advocatesof “cul-
ture” by many of our more nar-
r0w—minded cit.izens. .
It is very doubtful that Busi-
ness would take kindly to this
decline, and yet, here is a. man
at the top of the heap advocating

' measures which will effect that

decline. The irony is that he does
so for reasons which appear not
only desirable but essential for
the continued well-being of Busi-
ness itself.

What is all this leading to?
Nothing, except that we have
here a ‘perfect illustration of that
old_ historical principle: every

social institution has within it-"
self the seed of its own destruc-

tion, or at least its decline.

‘pleasure reading. One writer
called it “unrequired reading.
To many students_ the thought of
reading anything ' outside of
schoolwork is repulsive. They
want to get away from school and
all forms ‘of its discipline. But
“unrequired reading” is not rec-
ommended because it improves
your mind or widens your knowl-

,.edge and understanding.

things, it is: r‘ecommended be-

If you have not let one of the ‘

other of Pitt’s spare time groups
abs'orb all of your‘ time, try the
Alldred room. It may-turn. out
to be one of the most enjoyable

experiences you have in college. ~'

A 'By THELMA SIPE \
In Dr. John Nietz’s office on the

26th ﬂoor is one of the largest col- ‘

lections of old textbooks in the

50 to 400 years old.

‘Dr.-Nietz, a professor of educa-
tion, has been collecting these
books for over 20 years.

This library, that now overﬂows

walls of his oﬁice, was started ac-.
cidentally when one of his students
gave him a small brown book with
yellowed pages. That text, a Union
Spelling Book, was published in
1838 by the American Sunday

Wanted to Own Books ’
From then on, Dr. Nietz was not

satisﬁed with merely reading about _

and looking at pictures ofpold text-
He, wanted to own the
books; he wanted to study their
contents, bindings, printing. and

new editions came oil the press.

; Dr.‘Nietz combed the bookstores
and ‘second-hand furniture shops
in this area until he had exhaust-
ed all they had to offer.

~ The books in “old furniture
stores,” he says smiling, “are usu-
ally less expensive than in book
shops.” '

Furniture dealers often buy up
books for a ~ few cents a piece
along with a lot of furniture from
someone’s estate. Even if they re-
sell these books for 25 or 30 cents,
they still make a proﬁt.

its disappointments. ,Dr. Nietz re-

RONNIE BAINSFORD

. _ .
Hope in N C A A

Ronnie Gainsford, Eastern Col.-
legiate champ in both the 100 and
200 breaststrokes, heads a group
of three Pitt swimmers in the
NCAA meet tonight and tomorrow
at the Ohio State pool.

ECSA diving titlist Tom Bloss-
ner and Freddie O’Nions are the
other two Panthers who will swim
against the f‘cream of the crop.”

Gainsford, though, rates the best
chance to place high. Coach Ben
Grady says, “Ron is in good shape
and should qualify in both his
events. In fact, he has as good a
chance as anyone. In these kind of
meets, you can't really go on past
records.”

-His chief - competition in both
breaststrokes will come from Den-

of Wisconsin, and Jerry Holan of
Ohio State.

Although all three have re-
corded better times than Gains-
ford, Grady feels that “if things go

race.” ‘

Hugh Peery, sensational ‘Pitt ‘bantamweight wrestler,
ranked a heavy favorite to retain his 115-pound championship
at the 9 a.m. weigh-ins at Penn State today. ’

Peery is one of six Panthers who‘ will compete in the
National Collegiate championships which will start this
afternoon and end tomorrow night. —

Peery, Solomon Have Life

Included in the Pitt contingent
besides \ Peery are George Mat-
thews (137), Chuck Uram (147),
Joe Solomon (157), Harold Hunter
(191), and E l d r e d Kraemer,
(heavyweight) .

Peery and Solomon probably
hold the best positions for win-
ning an NCAA title. Peery is in
the midst of a 23 match winning
streak and should extend his‘ skein
over the weekend.

‘Solomon, who along with Uram

against the best‘ in‘ the country.
But, as long as there’s life, there's
hope.”

for four matches.

Coach Dave McCormick will en-
deavor to rebuild his gradu-ation-

erans Ted Dokmanovich and Dick

for the remainder of the team.
