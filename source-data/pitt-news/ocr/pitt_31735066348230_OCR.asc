STATE COLLEGE.‘ PA -Student
representation in Harrisburg took a
step forward here last weekend as
over I50 Pennsylvania students
froln 38 colleges and universities
convened to formulate a formal set
of goals for the newly founded
Pennsylvania Student Lobby (PSL).
The lobby, comprised of student
leaders from across the state, is an
_.,,...v-‘attempt to give the 500,000
Pennsylvania students a voice in

the Harrisburg state legislature by
working towards legislation pertin-
ent to their needs.

PSL members met at the main
calnpus of Penn State Saturday to

determine PSL by-laws and proce-

dures. elect a 15 member board of
directors. and enumerate the PSL's
“list of priorities."

‘The lnain priority of the lobby,
determined by a vote of its
membership, is increased financial
aid. "Both individual and institu-

BYPGENE GRABOWSKI
Pitt has been elected to member-
ship ill the American Association of
Universities (AAU). Chancellor’
Wesley Posvar announced last
week.
The AAU, a group of institutions
"“of higher learning whose graduate
and professional programs are
judged to be of exceptionally high
quality, has not named any new
members in several years, but last
week, at its bi-annual meetingin

The ambassador of Egypt to the
United States Ashraf A. Ghorbal‘
visited Pitt's campus ‘Saturday,
calling for improved educational
exchange programs between the
US and Egypt and asking for
assistance to -Egyptian universities
in the form of used equipment and
books. 0

Ghorbal was received by Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar and visited
Heinz Chapel and the Cathedral’s
Nationality Rooms on a brief tour.
He then arrived at the Syria-
Lebanon Room where he joined
members of the University com-
munity for an informal discussion.

Ghorbal said although tension in
the Middle East had helped bring
about a decrease in exchange
program participation. there were
also problems with varying educa-
tional structures. finances. and
cultural differences.

"One problem we have. is that
Egypt's school year runs froln
.5cptenlber_ to May." said.
“There is no breaking up into
terlns. It's just one school year."

University Center for Internation-
al Studies (UCIS) Assistant Direc-
tor James Way pointed out that
although a school like Pitt has three
terms per year, “We could very
well think about a school year,
perhaps in graduate studies.”

Ghorbal said a systeln of ﬁnancial
sharing could be set up where “the
sending country pays the air fare
and the receiving country pays the
maintenance."

,He seemed optimistic about the
prospects for improved. student
exchange. “Just to be able to talk

tional financial support must be
increased in ways that will
equitably benefit all types of post
secondary education in the Com-
monwealth.", the PSL’ official
statement reads.

The lobby also decided to work in
areas ‘of consumer protection, with
an emphasis on landlord-tenant
relations; furthering individual and
minority rights, including students,
women, and racial minorities;
expanding programs aimed at
benefiting veterans; increasing the
student minimum wage; and

enlarging federal wyork-study pro-
grams.

Pitt representative present at the

don't give people the idea that we
are only out to see 18 year olds
drinking," he said. “It would give
us more credibility if we consider
the bill before we support it."

Hertneky also suggested the
lobby call for “uniformity of law
enforcement” if it decided to
support the drinking bill. The PSL
decided not to list passage of the
bill under its priorities.

Under consumer issues. Hertneky
said the PSL should include
“community development" in
areas surrounding urban universi-
ties and colleges. “At Pitt," he
said. “you are not just forced to
live off campus, but you are forced
to live in a ghetto."

Under the present PSL structure,‘
each member institution is given
two votes in the general assembly
and in the caucuses. Hertneky,
along with a Temple representa-
tive. argued strongly that such a
provision was discriminatory to-
wards large universities. '

“Two votes for everyone is an
inequitable .situation. Universities
with large student bodies should be
given a stronger representative

voice,” Hertneky said.

Hertneky later said his main
reason in running for the board of
directors was to see that the PSL
by-laws be changed to allow
representative vote.

It was decided in the first meeting
of the PSL board. held Sunday

morning. to assess each member,

institution $.05 per student with a
maximum assessment of $200.
Under these criteria Pitt would be
expected to pay $200 per academic
year for membership in the lobby.

The board also agreed to meet
monthly with the next meeting
scheduled for December 14-15 at
Drexel University.

The PSL is modeled after similar
lobbies in other states, according to
PSL board member and Penn State
student Frank Muraca.

“The concept of the lobby began
here at Penn State when we tried to
start a full-time lobby for just this
school." Muraca ‘ told the PSL
members. “We couldn't get funds.
so last February we met to try to
form a state student lobby."

The PSL since then, Muraca said,
has been organized by a group of
students from across the state.

    
  
 
 
 
  
  

“Louisville Sluggers baseball bats
have a lobby, but until today the
500,000 students in Pennsylvania
had no representation," Muraca
said.

Mark Speaker, a La Salle student
and coordinator of the PSL, said the
lobby would have definite power in
Harrisburg. “One of the few tools a
lobby has is pressure. and we can
say we represent all of the
Pennsylvania students. »That is
pressure." he said.

The next general convention of all
PSL members is tenatively sche-
duled for early spring.

Following the Penn State meet-
ing, Pitt representative Hertneky
said he was pleased with what he
and the PSL had accomplished.
“We got the organization off the
ground and that is important." he
said.

“Pitt has ‘to play a large‘ part in
the PSL now," Hertneky contin-
ued. “Pitt and Duquesne are the
only two large universities in this
part of the state -- and we both
differ -as far as needs are
concerned.”

Hertneky said much had been
accomplished in ‘the two ‘day

Extended Library Hours
~.-Possible Next Tri—mester

BY BILL HADUCK

Plans should be ﬁnalized within a
few weeks to permanently extend
hours at Hillman library according
to the library's administrative and
ﬁscal control director's assistant,
Robert Neumann.

The move to extend the hours
came after meetings between
library officials, the chancellor’s

’ office, and Resident Student

i‘v‘= 

.~

Association (RSA) leaders who
determined extended hours at the
library were needed to provide a

 much needed study area for

resident and night school students.

Under the new plan Hillman
Library, which.has been closing at
11:30 pm, would be open until one
am Sunday through Thursday.

“Plans haven't been finalized,"
Neumann said, “but it’ will
probably go through.” He said
funding would come from the
chancellor's office, but procedures
have it tied up in the office of the
provost at the present time.

‘‘I think it will be a good thing for
the students,” he said, but added
there had been some hesitancy
about the proposal because of
difficulties in restricting the hours
to students actually utilizing the
services.

“We don't want to turn the library
into a nightclub," he said. ’i

“We need a well lighted quiet
area for studies,” RSA Chairman
Jim Datovech said. “Hillman
Library is the cheapest and only
place on campus for it right now.

“Benedum Hall used to be open
24 hours if you signed in and out
and all, but lately the janitors have
been telling people to leave.
Things got to be, there was no
place to study. p

“The dorms are too noisy and
there was. also a problem for

General Studies students whoi
.might have a class until 10:30.

They would only have maybe an
hour to study. ‘

“Last year we tried to get the
hours extended and as you'll
remember it was opened until one
am and for 24 hours during ﬁnals,
but it was on an experimental
basis.

“This year when we came back in
the fall. the library was back on its
old schedule so we went to talk to
Library Director Glenora Rossell,"
Datovech said. “We'd never seen
any ﬁgures on the results of the
experiment."

He said a RSA survey taken in
October showed that 60% of people
in the library between 10 and 11:30
pm were using it for studying
purposes rather than’ gathering of
material.

Chancellor Posvar gave credit to

faculties on any campus in the

country" for Pitt's election into the
,AAU.

“Recognition of this faculty's

2 The question of faculty unioniza-
tions is of great importance to
students as well as faculty on this
campus. '

Although several articles have
appeared in various campus publi-

"uncertainty and confusion around
this issue. S

It -is with this mind that the
College Young Democrats, (CYD),
Pitt College Republicatians (CR),
Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and
Student_Government Board (SGB),
along with other campus organiza-

points of view represented, is both
desirable and necessary.

campus institution, and the strong

speaking, and he brought the
subject at the Pitt News editorial
board meeting that evening. The
next day we were informed no
member of the editorial board
would be willing to participate in
such a forum. The claim was that
to do so would go beyond their
“responsibility.”

The Pitt News will not deny the
importance of this (matter. The
paper actually admits it has enough
time to arrange for a representative
to speak in its behalf, but has

_refused to do so.

The Pitt News has refused to back
up its editorial for one simple
reason. It feels it does not have to
be responsible to the Pitt student
body and faculty.

lt’s the YSA’s feeling that any
organization that gets some of it’s
money from student’s pockets (and
$27,000 is a nice sum) has to be
responsible to the hands that feed
them. The Pitt News has no

‘ quarrels with accepting money and

editorializing away but when it
comes down to standing behind
those editorials, there’s no one to
be found.

This question of “responsibility"
should definitely be ‘on the agenda
of the University commission that
has been set up to evaluate the Pitt

News. The YSA feels the Pitt News

Pitt News Study Commission

BY TOM SMITH

The Pitt News Study Commission
has been appointed and charged by
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs
Alfred Moye. The panel was ‘
established upon the request of Pitt
News editor-in-chief Scott Mac-
Leod. Its function is to study the
present structure of the newspaper
and determine the degree to which
it is serving the campus commun-
ity.

The operations of the Pitt News ,
- are partially funded by Student

Government (SG) through the stu-
dent activities fee. Disagreements
over the newspaper’s budget last
summer indicated the need for
such a study in order to avoid
similar difficulties in the future.
But, it seems the stucture and the
membership of the committee will
make this unlikely.

According to Moye the commis-
sion will begin its study without
presuming any pre-existing condi-
tions or problems. However, the
panel's work would be facilitated if
‘there was a realization that certain
problems did indeed lead to its
formation.

Nor is it necessary to‘ waste time
defining the problem which has

colored the relationship, between /

the paper and SG. For years
Student Governments and Pitt
News staffs have been involved_in
serious’ conflicts relative to the
paper's format and the amount of
SG‘s financial allocation to the Pitt"
News. Student Governments have

insisted the newspaper, lke any

student organization, must be sub-
ject to financial controls to insure
the proper expenditures of stu-
dents‘ activities funds. On the
other hand Pitt News editors have
claimed such controls are a threat
to’ the newspaper's right of free
press. ‘ -
The dilemma then, is simply this

Interests Charge

Editor:

We, the Nursing Student Organi-
zation (NSO) of the University of
Pittsburgh would like to clarify a
degrading statement in the Friday,
October ll issue of the Pitt News.
The statement reads:

_ “The Board also decided to

‘inactivate’ the budgets of five

student organizations who repeat-

edly failed to attend Student

Government Board (SGB) meet-

ings to discuss funding.

Pi Tau Sigma, Pitt Bowling Club,
Nursing Student Organization,
Physical Education Club, and the
American Pharmaceutical Society
budgets were inactivated ‘for lack
of interest.”

After reading the article we, the

 

News, and how can the Pitt News
be held accountable for the proper
expenditure of student monies,
while at the same time the news-

paper’s right of free press . is.

guaranteed?

Though the committee is designed
to investigate the relationship be-
tween the paper and SG, the study
panel should have as its sole
emphasis the resolution, not the
definition of'this problem. After-
all, the problems and the pre-exist-
ing conditions are evident to all
those involved either in SG or the
Pitt News.

To what extent, then, will the
commission be capable of solving
the problem?

Since the study panel is only an
advisory body, Student Govem-
ment orlthe Pitt News could reject
the commission’s findings. It is"

paramount, ‘then, that the two’

parties agree with the. commis-
sion’s function .and accept its
conclusions. However, the com,-

position of the panel increases the '
possibility its findings will not be _
‘accepted and, if

in effect the
commission will have been only a
bureaucratic nightmare.

Excluding ex officio members the
commission is comprised of_three
students, two administrators, two’
liberal arts faculty members, a
former Pitt News editor and busi-
ness manager, and the education
writer of the Pittsburgh Press.

The non-voting members of the
commission include the editor-in-
chief of the Pitt News, its advisor,
outgoing Student" Government Pre-
sident Mike Furick, and the Coor-

dinator of the Campus Judicial’

System.

It is vital that the future interests
of both the Pitt News and SG be
adequately represented on the
panel. And yet, no one from either
the Pitt News, the Student Govem-
ment’ Board, or the Allocations
Committee are voting members of

present NSO officers, talked with
our allocations advisor and found
this “inactivation” dealt with the
funding of a Career Seminar ($56)
submitted by former NSO officers.
We had attended " arf allocations
budget review of this money re-
quest last May and had agreed with
the decision of that committee to
decline funds for it, as the Nursing
Career Seminar did not include the
interests of Pitt asla whole. We had
not heard further of meetings to
attend 91: this matter.

The NSO representatives attend-
ed all of the meetings of the
Allocations Review Committee re-
garding our request for money.
We also attend all of the Student
Government Board (SGB) meetings
when our budgets came up to be
voted on, when we were informed
of the SGB meeting. (Even though
we would be notified by SGB only
hours before the meeting would
begin.)

The NSO does not have this “lack
of interest" and requests that the
SGB members and/or the Pitt
News retract this statement as it is
damaging to our reputation as a
very interested Nursing Student
Organization. Thank you.

The Nursing Student Organization
Officers 1974-75 p‘

the commission.

Quite clearly, however, the inter-
ests of the Pitt News are well
represented, but the concerns of
Student Government are not. No
member of the Allocations Com-
mittee, who are most familiar with
the funding procedures of Student
Government is a member. No
member of Student Government
who will be involved in making the
decision next yvinter whether to
accept or reject the commision’s
findings is a member of the
commission._ And, no Student
Government advisor, who will be
responsible for directing SG’s ac-
tions on this issue is a member of
the committee. ‘

Thus, no matter what the com-
mission’s findings entail, the con-

clusions will be judged by Student '

Government in light of their inade-
quate representation on the study
paneL

The membership of the panel,
however, raises another issue.
Less that 1/3 of the commission’s
members are students. The con-
flicts between Student Government
and the Pitt News are student
problems and can and should be
solved by students. In the past
both groups have operated under
time deadlines—the beginning of
the new fiscal year—when the Pitt
News budget was under critical
examination by SG. This has

prevented SG and the newspaper‘

from taking the extra time needed

/ to adequately resolve the difficult-

ies.

(And despite the panel’s ‘recom-
mendations, the problem will not
be solved until representatives
from the Pitt News and Student
Government approach the problem
rationally and reach a permanent
agreement relative to the relation-
ship between Student Government
and the student newspaper.

Under no circumstances, should
the study panel be comprised solely
of students. However, if the
membership had included more
students, who will be directly
involved in the two groups come
budget time next March,
prospects for the solution of the
problems would be much greater.

These student members could
have represented the commission’s
work and_ its viewpoint to both
Student Government and the Pitt
News without being concerned with
the adequacy of representation.

Furthermore, there is a basic
assumption in the structure of the
commission’s membership that the
Pitt News and Student Government

are unable to solve the problem by

working together in a calm and
unpressured atmosphere. The
simple truth is that it has never
been attempted, so such an as-
sumption is grossly unfair to the
students involved in both groups.
And, ﬁnally, the panel's structure
raises the distinct possibility the
commission’s recommendations

will either be imposed on the two ‘

groups or' will short circuit the
existing funding procedures. This
would solve nothing, but create
even more problems involving the
paper, SG, and the authority of the
Student Affairs Office.

Skeleton in the
C/oset-ROTC

Dear Editor.
In December 1969, the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences (FAS) voted to
remove allcredit for ROTC courses
taught at Pitt. This action was
taken in the midst of nationwide
protesting of the war in Vietnam
and bombing of ROTC offices at
various colleges. Luckily, here at

as Pitt, we had no bombings or
violence, but the action taken by
the Faculty -has proven to have
long-terin effects on the lives‘ of
many students.

Because of the lack of credit for
ROTC, the number of students
enrolled in the program has
dropped to about one quarter the
number in 1968. Not only have the
numbers decreased, but those still
in the program must now carry a
course load of at least 18 credit
hours a term to graduate in four
years.

Many of the arguments offered

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIllIIIllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

  Elbe iﬁttt /ﬁrms

against ROTC in the “Report of
FAS committee to Study ROTC" of
1969 and 70 are no longer valid (if
they everlwere valid), because of
some changes made within the
military itself.

I feel that this decision by FAS
was an emotionally based one
made during a heated and dis-
turbed time in American history
and is now just a skeleton in the
closet for the University and an
academic hinderanceto a number
of students.

Editor:

A funny thing happened to me on
my way to the Student Government
office the other day. I bumped into
the Pitt News sports page editor:
Bart Mack. Somehow. we started
talking and during the course of the

conversation. I asked Bart why the

More Letters to the Editor

sports page of the Pitt News
doesn't any information
concerning intramural sports at
this university. Bart answered my
question with a two point response:

1) there is no room on the sports
page for intramurals and 2) There
is not enough student interest in
the intramural program to warrant
space in the Pitt News.

C 21 1' 

That answer to my mind is totally

ludicrous. The section that annoys
me the most is the second part:
There is no interest. According to
the 1974-1975 intramural hand-
book, which was distributed in
September, 58,898 faculty, and
students participated in the intra-
mural sports program last year.

Five thousand eight hundred and
ninety eight persons: if that rather
large number shows a lack of

interest than my name is Wesley

Posvar.

recognized the great student
interest in intramural activities and

can recognize the great interest in
intramurals. why can't the Pitt
News sports editor; (who suppos-
edly keeps in better Contact with
student needs. as far as sports is
concerned.)

I also have great difficulty in
attempting to understand the first
portion of Bart‘s answer: i.e. no
room. If you look in any of the
previous Pitt News’. the sports
page is clustered with API
(Associated Press liiternational)
articles concerned with the Steel-
ers. the Penguins. and various
other professional teams. I think
the Pitt News should be commen-
ded for their attempt to keep
students informed about sports
happenings on a natioﬁallevel.
However, to include on the sports

page so many articles abotit
professional sports, so nianly
articles about Pitt football, so many
articles about Tony Dorsett that
there is “no room” at all on.th,é
sports page for intramural ‘activi-
ties is. in my mind. a complete_
reversal of the Pitt News’ obl"  T
’ tion to students.  '5
There is great interest flinvjg
intramurals; it seems everyone is‘
aware of that fact except the Pitt
News. There also could be “room.”-. i
on the sports page for articles
about intramurals; it is the editor-’Js
decision. Ihope he makes the right
decision. A » t '8 -

Social concern is alive and well at
the Pitt YMCA.

Student volunteers have taken on
three new programs, in addition to
the long list of projects they still
maintain. Women and Girl Of-
fenders and One-to-One operate on
a person-to-person basis, while the
Marcy Hospital program involves

group interaction of patients with

volunteers.

Women and Girl Offenders
(WGO) provides newly released
female inmates with help in adjust-
ing to the outside world. The
program is patterned
after the state WGO and works
closely with the Pittsburgh branch.

The Pittsburgh agency matches
student volunteers with former

inmates on a one—to—one basis. The
pairs are asked to meet at least
once a month, hold at least two
phone conversations, and volun-
teers must attend ‘an organizational
meeting. .

Alumni Assoc. Keeps Pitt

. BY DENISE SHAPIRO

As student enrollment, faculty.
staff and buildings expand yearly
at Pitt, the Pitt Alumni Association
expands as well. Its annually
growinghiembership new numbers
over 91,000 and in order to keep

communication open and to contin-

ue interest in the University. the
Association has initiated several
new programs.

Currently, each of the_ 16
academic schools have their own
Alumni Associations. Pitt clubs
constitute their own associations
and special interest groups [Band
Alumni Association, Pitt Golden
Panthers] have their own_as well.

Each of these groups is a member_

of the General Alumni Association
and each elects a representative to
the Alumni Council. The Alumni
Council meets five times a year to
discuss issues, develop programs,
and elect alumni members-to the
University Board of Trustees.
General interest in and ‘-financial
support of the University has been
good in the past, according to Bob
Rosborough. director of alumni
affairs and executive secretary to
the Alumni Council, but the
Council is trying to make it better.
In September, the Council voted

The children are not delinquents,
according to co-ordinator Mark
Miller, but could very well become
deliquent if something like One-to-
One weren't open to them.

“Volunteer commitment involves
seeing the child once a week,
ideally," he said. "The YMCA h_as

Council would like to have each
class elect three Alumni represen-
tatives. “By doing so. Alumni
would have a greater voice in
political decisions of the Universi-
ty," said Rosborough. “The Board
of Directors of the Alumni
Association now has only 12
members who meet once a year to
plan activities. With the ‘Class
Councilsf. one out.of the three
members would become a member
ofthe Board; so this would improve
the political process. There
wouldn't be control by only a few.’
In the past, each academic school
has held bi-annual telethons for
alumni to raise money for the
school. The class representatives
would shoulder some of this and
would help the Alumni Office
coordinate "communication and
schedule events. ‘
‘Alumni committees have already
begun work on the project by
looking through old yearbooks to
find out who the prominent
classmates were in each class.
From this. ‘a list of six nominees
will be mailed to alumni from which
they will elect the three class
representatives.’ It is hoped that
‘Class Councils’ will‘. be in
operation no later than July, 1975.

"We like students to volunteer for

Unlike One-to-One and Women
and Girl Offenders, the new Marcy
Hospital program plans to work on
a group rather than individual
basis.

According to project. head Gary
Hallemeier, March State Hospital,
located on Leech Farm Road near
the Veterans Hospital,/ is now
accepting mental patients from the
overcrowded Polk Instituion. So far

.Marcy has a hundred patients and

is expecting an additional 250.
‘‘We’ll be concentrating on three
specific areas," explained Halle-
meier. “First. we want to_develop
alternative activities for _the pa-
tients to use when volunteers

aren't around. Second. we'd like to
foster the general socialization of
patients among themselves. And

third. ‘we want to teach them basic

living and learning‘skills."

The minimal commitment invol-
ves a session at Marcy one night a
week, and hopefully a monthly
excursion off the hospital grounds.
The patients range in age 25 to 50,
and from a higher functioning
group. :5

Hallemeier plans to have the
volunteer group instruct the pa-
tients in arts and crafts one week,
exercising the next week. and so
forth. lf one-to-one relations arise
from the sessions, they'll be en-

/couraged. “Since this institution is
still new, we may be able to make it

not so institutionalized." he hopes.
V “The patients have adjusted pret-A
ty well.“ Hallemeier went on.
“Some, however, were shaken up
by the switch from Polk. At Marcy
two or three persons share a room
rather than .30 like it was at Polk."
When asked about the extra
amount of patience required to deal
with the Marcy people, Hallemeier
disagreed. “One doesn't require
that much more patience—one
must just break down long-range 
goals into small, speciﬁc ones."

Thoughts p
at Small

BY JESS M. BRALLIER "
ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT ED_ITOR

 

Seeing the Pitt production of Cabaret this past weekend was a
disgusting experience. Oh, the production was great, full of thought
and proper execution but that’s an odd point as it's somebody else's
criticism this time around...what has me personally worried is the
audience. oh: my, that's where in the disgust lies.

It's sort of a matter of ignorance, not without a saving grace as the
audience was still there--but even more than ignorance as I find that
‘acceptable, but close-mindness...there‘s just no excuse.

Evidently, somewhere about a generation or two ago, this nation’s
aesthetic appreciation was cut, twisted and finally limited to
availability and environment. «

Something like, “Here kids, here's a quarter, go see a ﬁlm, enjoy
yourself and stay out of my hair, in fact, I'll give you a quarter every
week to enjoy yourself." t j

A couple of years go past and...“I-Iey kids, wejust bought our first TV
and we're going to put it in the basement where you can .watch it all
day, and I hear that they're going to show a lot of movies on it." And

' amongst this innocent, but .future mess, was radio, an easy enough

medium...one that pouilds away, at each new generation's ears, one
that's run on the major part by money-hungry, promotional-stained
and tasteless looneys. And words, words! Literature's always been
there, pounded into each generation, taught endlessly...and...and...

Here they come! Here they come! Strutting into Pitt’s administration
office, proud heads up, self-assured, Beatles in ear, Altman and
P'ec'kinpah in eyes, and Vonnegut and Hesse in arm, satisfied that their
artistic experience is complete and more than willing to argue their
cocky but ignorant attitude to the end. Sure, they know their literature,
films and one limited, specific genre of music. “But what about the
performing arts dear Pitt student?” “The performing arts?--ah, shove
them up Europe’s ass.”

It's this closeminded attitude that sickens me and it's this that I
sensed at Cabaret...the inability of intelligent people to differentiate
between artistic mediums, ﬁlm and theatre...the inability to remember

._ the long ago, but first fulfilling aesthetic experience, it happens in

every genre...the inability to realize that each art form has and uses
specific elements in a common finalization.

Personally, I'm an ignorant fool, inable to experience a Picasso, but
yet I find it impossible to dismiss...my knowledge is simply too limited.
I find the unreal distortions while roaming through Scaife Gallery
simply nothing, yet I can trust it as art for I can handle the intangible
and twisted appearance of a theatrical perforniance...a bit of
k'nowledge is the only difference. This is why 1 find it so sickening to
hear one who can grasp and love Brautigan's writings dismiss the
strange distortion of the Cabaret scenes.

Dear people, give it a chance. No, director Gil Elvgreii and Paul
Binotto's interpretation of the Emcee is not the same as Joel Grey's,
although every bit as ‘valid. The earthy colors in Henry Heymaiin's
bedroom set aren't a matter of available paint. but a successful attempt
at that set's realism contrasted with the Cabaret's bright, lusty
atmosphere. Lynn Heininingway's costume colors are not earthy in
one scene and powerfully bright in another for the simple hell of
it...much the same as literature alliteration and a film's blurry color
distortion. And we_all know the clowns not there in the script, biit it's
a sweet mixture as the Emcee's alter ego and symbolic presentation of

a sleeping Germany firialized in a muted screaming pain...it's as valid .

as Shakespeare's masking images. And the Cabaret poster isn't made
with that deep. deep red eye, ready to explode and overwhelm the
gray—black of the entire poster for the hell of it.

And it again amazes me that a majority of the audience simply
watches the center of the stage’s action. never considering color,
setting and lighting. How many of these same people read a book only
for its plot, ignoring symbolism and images.

No, it's not the ignorance that bothers me. and yes, I'm glad and
moved by the high attendance...but no, never, will I accept the
closemindedness of any so called group of students.'

plays on consecutive evenings. An
original musical entitled, The Great
Air Robbery featuring "Martians

Brecht's The Mother played to two
compositely different audiences.
One of the Troupe's actors, Steve,
spoke of their audience make-up:
“We're not playing for the
bourgeois bur for everyong. The
majority of people who come to’see
us don't often go to the theater.

for a show, then you stay

money's worth. _,Since it's free in

have to stay and enjoy it. And they
will only watch for as long as it says
something important to them. ,
“Our new kind of theatre, ideally,
is for people. All of,the people.

different villages throughout the
country and raise their level of
political consciousness. They
certainly plan to hit some of the
larger “vil1ages" including t eir
five week stop in the Chelsea

Theater Westside in New York.

A prime example of the Troupe's
ideology, is their presentation of
Brecht's The Mother. It concerns
itself with a middle aged Russian
worker and her role of integrating
the Marxist doctrine into the
worker's lives. She's a crusty old
beast whose soaring Russian spirit
is captured in one climactic
moment. The young man who
carried the red flag in the striking
workers' march has been killed.
l-Ier people's flag lies crumpled on
the ground in need of strong. warm
hands to raise it high. The mother
finally realizing her duty, reaches
for theilag and lifts it upwards
towards the sky. Filled with her
Marxist beliefof class equality. she
leads her fellow workers onward.

These ideological principles could
be considered trite quests if not for
the sincere incorporation of those
principles into the Troupe's own
workings.

with the whole story. .

Come to think of it, nothing really
has “much to do" with the whole
story, because it's hard to say what
the "whole story” is about. Is it
about Christina's sexual problems?
The Cardinal's quest for power?
The problems of a female ruler
(presented in a very anti-feminist
manner, portraying the woman as
subject to frequent fits and entirely
dependent on her emotions, hardly
fit to rule herself. not to mention a
country)? Or the “profane love"
the ads proclaim?

Actually, since'none‘ of these
things take up much of the movie,
it’s not really about anything. It’s

like a non-plot with a lot of ,

subplots.

The direction is rather overdone in
The Abdications zooming in for
uncalled closeups and having sev-
eral too many of the “heroine
running from something-or-other
and bumping into things" scenes,
usually, accompanied by music that
is just too overblown to take
seriously.

The Abdication is a dull, plodding

movie, too caught up in its own _

self-importance and dramatics to
be important or dramatic for an
audience. If Liv Ullmann want to be
A Woman For All Seasons, she
sorta missed. .

Pauline Kael's four collections of

‘T film criticism are like the works of

"the best film directors; they are
infused with a consistent and
original personal vision of art and
life. Deeper Into Movies. Kael's
most recent book and winner of the
1974 National Book Award, con-
tains her.New Yorker columns from
September 1969 to March 1972.
Deeper Into Movies doesn't have
the fine, penetrating essays like
“The Making of The Group" in
Kiss, Kiss, Bang Bang (1966) or
"Art, Trash and the Movies" in
Going Steady (1969) but Kae1's

weekly colunms explore even more

thoroughly than her earlier

P‘: writings “the interaction of movies

and our national life." These

reviews also tie individual films to
larger trends and traditions of
movie making. V

For Kael, Bob & Carol & Ted &
Alice is unsettling to many viewers
because “People may be so des-
perate to be other than what they
are that they resent a movie for
dealing with bourgeois values even
in disruption." Paint Your Wagon
is typical of recent expensive
pictures which attempt to “find the
secret of somebody else's suc-
cess."

The ending of The Godfather
differs from earlier gangster films
as the criminals aren’t vanquished:
to Kael this is indicative of a “new
tragic realism which acknowledges
organized crime as “what we fear
Americanism to be.” Insights like
these are blended with prose which
is clear and eloquent, a sense of
humor that is lively but never
cheaply cynical, and analyses that
reflect a healthy skepticism and
inquisitiveness and above all, a
deep concern for the state of the art
that Kael~'calls “our national thea-
tre.”

Like all critics (and all people)
Kael has biases; she likes films like
Cabaret and The Godfather which

filmscome from and are made for.
Kael rejects excessive artifice and
artiness and the manipulative cold-
ness of films_ like A Clockwork
Orange. _

Kael’s reviews exude her endur-
ing involvement with movies; while

most film reviews give the impres-

sion that the author is doing them
only because that’s his job, Kael’s
radiate a love for the movies; you
get the impression that she’d do
them for nothing, that her passion
for films overrides the dullness and
aeademicism found in too many

, other reviews.

The goal of these pieces is “to get
at the many ways in which movies,
by affecting us on sensual and
primitive levels. are a supremely
pleasurable - and dangerous - art
form." The frequency with which
she combines her enormous know-
ledge of films with perceptions of
her feelings make Deeper Into
Movies engrossing reading.

Keol and Johnston Collections Personal“;

Village Voice columns, the best of
which have been collected in
Gullibles Travels.

Gullibles Travels which is divided
into four parts presents articles
from 1970 to l973. The preface
observes that this book offers ,us
Jill Johnstons's celebration of her-
self in motion. The first part is
directly concerned with her travels;
we read about Johnston on college
lecture «trips in the Midwest;
traversing the country in a camper,
a visit to England; Amsterdam...
Greece...Jill Johnston never stops
moving and conveys this with her
prose which breathlessly carries
the reader along.

The second part is what she labels
“Aubitograffiti." She aims “like
Apollianaire" to “exploit our ex-
pansive personalities by celebrat-
ing them in or works and saying
that around this composite creation
unites a‘ contlagration of dream and
reality."

Experimental pieces comprise the
brief third section while the fourth
is composed of lucid essays in
which Johnston discusses her feel-
ings about Bella Abzug, R.D.
Laing, artist Agnes Martin and
lesbian feminist movement politics.

Johnston's writing is always in
motion, clobbering the reader with
an»; assortment of word plays and
puns; some like “middle crass
values" are terrificly perceptive
encapsulations which are obviously
the product of a vital, creative
intelligence.

Johnston’s run-on words and sen-
tences are the perfect writing
counterpart for her rambling life-
style. This added to her ability to
invest mythology with personal
meanings and her frequently self-
depreciating sense of humor make
her best columns some of the finest
non-fiction that l’ve read recently.
In the midst of apparent gibberish
she’ll hit you with an insight like

...‘

"The idea that pleasure could be‘
an end in itself is so startling and so

threatening to the stricture of our‘?
society that the mere possibility is-‘
denied." or “by being loved one is]
placed under an unsolicited obliga,-J ,

tion.”

Johnston takes a lot of risks. The{'
.writings are so tied up _with her ,
personal life that you won't like the _

book unless you like the author's"

personality. A book like this could 1

be a real dog if Johnston's life and'

personality weren't interesting but‘ ,2
her-"I
lesbianism and her feminism...at >)
the same time she knows “not to .

she is proud of herself,

I

take herself too seriously. A few S
pieces fall really flat but when you-3
try something unusual that's bound i
‘to happen. ' 3

Compared to Johnston’s last
book, Lesbian Nation‘ [I973], Gulli-

bles Travels is mellower, ‘more,

accessible, less topical and ulti-

mately less significant. While Les- '."
bian Nation was manifesto-like, ‘
Gullibles Travels almost inverts the —
notion that the personal is political 
and shows what it’s like for. Jill" ”
Johnston to live out her philosophy. ‘

-Gullibles Travels’ Breakneck

prose mayleave several read'ers"
stranded on the wayside and it is '
probably best read in short sittings. '
But anyone who ignores Johnston."
because of her subject, style, or
point of view is going to‘ miss some ~
writing that redeems every flop__“,
with a unique and revealing obser- 

vation.

Johnston says “bad writing is J
emotional writing about things you ‘
think you need. writing is about :

itself." ‘

To some extent. appreciation of.
either of these books is predicated 5

on responding to the feelings of the
authors. But when. Kael and

Johnston are so willing (and so.’
into their J,

able) to dig deeply
feelings. that isn't much to ask.

 There I was. my bags all packed. ready and waiting for a pleasant
._ V week in sunny El Paso. Texas. And according to ofﬁcial rumors flying

all week. so were most members of the Pitt football team expecting

A-,. some invitation to play in a post-season event. supposedly the Sun

7 Bowl. after they polished off the Temple Owls.
As early as last Wednesday the Associated Press had announced the

{S  . probable matchup of Pitt and Oklahoma State in El Paso. But things

changed in a matter of days and now the Panthers, even with their
victory over Temple and a 7-2 record, are out in the cold. T
Instead of Pitt. Sun Bowl officials extended an invitation to North
Carolina. one of the two only squads to top the Panthers. and
somewhere the rumor was spread that the Tarheels had to beat
Clemson mauled North Carolina. and

But the Sun Bowl doesn't have to worry. Thev're not the onlv ones to

be embarrassed so early before the end of the season. Georgia beats
. Florida (Sugar Bowl) NC State beats Penn State (Cotton Bowl) and

suddenly it becomes status quo to have your team lose immediately
' after the invitations are out. '

The bowl officials have no one to blame but themselves, letting the
whole string of New Year’s Day appearances get out of hand two years
ago when teams began inviting themselves by a squad vote. Penn
State did it this year, although they would have been a likely candidate
for the Cotton Bowl anyway.

The gentleman's agreement that bowl officials supposedly maintain
with teams is ottt the window. If Alabama wants to meet Notre Dame
in a given year when they are battling for the nations number one spot.
all they have to do is take a team vote to spend New Years Eve in New
Orleans. and it's as good as done. I

Bowl games have been big business for a long time. The hundreds of
thousands of dollars for merely appearing. the television rights. the
exposure and subsequent prestige that will naturally lead to a better
look next year from the wealthier bowls. all make the complications
now involved with the system doomed to become even more
embarrassing. 4

It was.reported in last week's Football Weekly by its editor Roger

' ‘L S—t_anton._g that the, Big.-Teri and.the_Pacific Eight .are.con,sidering a-_"_.

grabbed two key passes for 41
yards on important scoring drives.

But Temple wasn’t without their
own heroics. With the Panther
secondary shutting off the passing
attack of quarterback Steve Joa-
chim, the Owls put together a
fierce running attack which kept

the all-time leading rusher for
Temple as he smashed his way
through the Pitt line for 132 yards
on 27 carries. Halfback Kevin
Grady added another 106 yards_on
lo carries for Owls as Joachim
exhibited his polished skill of
running the option.

them in the game until late in the
fourth quarter.

change in format. Instead of the "runner-up in each conference sitting
out New Year's Day, a rule change would allow them eligibility for
another invitation. which both conferences prohibit under their present
policies. I

Stanton has a point. If Ohio State does beat Michigan, it will be up to I

a vote of the Big Ten board of officials to decide on a representative.
But there is more to be considered. ‘

The NCAA should take the matter into its .hands and straighten it out

once an_d for all. What college football needs is a structured system
under which the NCAA officials would decide who goes where‘. or at
least who gets what invitation.
’ Under the present format, with all of the post-season affairs being
played in the warm climates of the West and South and the winners of
certain conferences automatically receiving bids. some of the best
teams in the country are being excluded through a discriminatory
process. _

I'd prefer the NCAA to do away with the Big Ten-Pacific Eight
matchup in the Rose Bowl, the Southwestern conference winner going
to the Cotton Bowl and any other agreement bowl officials have with
regional conferences. The NCAA would have the leeway to arrange
meetings of prospective number one candidates at the end of the
season, when all the results are in. g ’

The bowl officials wouldn't have much to cry about either. The
staggered television air times of all the New Year's games guarantee a
standard revenue. I doubt if any major bowl could seriously consider a
drop in attendance despite the invited teams in this football-mad
nation. 1

As far as Pitt is concerned this year. the Liberty Bowl is still another
outside possibility. but that's just another rumor. The team attitude is
now one of vindication and determination to prove the obvious
blunders made by the effete bowl representatives. Next rumor bound
to be heard is if Pitt beats Notre Dame, THEN they'll get a bid to the
Liberty Bowl.

With all the homage and preferences being paid and shown to the
traditionral powers of the last five years, I'm starting _to wonder if Pitt

Temple scored late in the quarter
to gain a 17-14 lead on a five-yard
run by Hynoski but the Panthers
drove the length of the field again
on the next series which was
capped in the fourth quarter with
Walker going in from the two.
With seven minutes remaining in
the game, the-Panthers were down

acquired the ball on the Pitt 38

Hynoski got the touchdown for the
Owls as he busted into the endzone

- Walker, Murphy Combine,   To Top Owls

BY JIM SPANOS
Bruce Murphy and Elliot Walker
are different ways.
Murphy is a senior who has started
at wingback, all season. Walker a
freshman who has spent Saturday

in m a n y

afternoons mostly on the bench

behind Tony Dorsett. Walker is
from Florida. Murphy from Ohio,
and Walker outweighs Murphy by

20 pounds. But against Temple on -

Saturday. the two teamed up in the
Pitt backfield. putting on an

electrifying display of speed and
determination which powered the
Panthers to their seventh win of the

13".

MOVE OVER TONY--ELLIOT WALKER

. SC'dS()I1 .

Murphy’ and Walker together
accounted for 291 yards in total
offense and scored all five of the
Pitt touchdowns. Their perfor-
mance came just a few days after

some bowl committee officials" had I
I publicly questioned whether I Pitt
‘ could field a

“representative”
team without Tony Dorsett, who

has been hobbled by a bruised

ankle.
Walker. one of the “Blue-chip"
players recruited by Majors this
year. rushed for 169 yards on 25
carries. running

through, over.

(number 34 above).has

proven that there is more than one outstanding runner in the Pitt
backfield with four touchdowns and 169 yards‘ against Temple last

Saturday .
