University of Pittsburgh Presi-
dent Wesley Posvar reached a pre-
liminary agreement last week with
University of Havana representa-
tives for an exchange program
between the two universities.

“I think the point was made very
clear,” Posvar said, addressing
Senate Council members Tuesday,
“that academic relationships trans-
cend political relationships.”

Carmelo Mesa-Lago, director of
Pitt’s Center for Latin American
Studies and architect of the pro-

I '.
‘ es

posed exchange program, called it
the most comprehensive agreement
made thus far between the U.S. and
Cuba. -

“Other universities are known to
have exchanged agreements with
Cuba.” Mesa-Iago said, “but their
programs have been limited to for-
eign affairs and political matters.
Our program has a much wider
scope, covering the natural as well as
the social sciences and the applied
professions.”

The program covers six areas of
exchange. The first is a faculty
exchange, which will allow Pitt
faculty members to work in Cuba,

pare artistic exchanges.

mainly on research projects, but also
on teaching assignments.

“I have been to Cuba three times,"
Mesa-Lago said, “and each time I
could spend only a week or 10 days
there. Not much can be accomp-
lished in such a short time. We
would like to be able to send a

faculty member to Cuba for one or

two months so that he can have ade-
quate time to complete his
research.”

Pitt plans exchange with University of Havana

works to several other universities
across the U.S.

Collaborative research is the third
area of exchange. Mesa-Lago said
he hopes to see joint research pro-
jects in medicine, public health, edu-
cation and social security.

Limited library exchanges are
already in operation, although
Mesa-Lago would like to see them
improved. '

“We have asked permission to
sendour Latin American Studies
librarian to Cuba several times,”
Mesa-Lago said. “At one point, he
received the Cubans’ invitation but
was unable to secure a visa."As with

Hazing  

 

our other exchange proposals, this is
a sensitive political issue.”

Political differences have also pre-
vented Cuban professors from pub-
lishing their work in Cuban Studies,
a national journal published twice a
year by the University of Pittsburgh
Press.

“The journal is sent to 22 places in
Cuba,” Mesa-Lago said, “and
although we have asked several
Cubans to contribute, only two of
their articles have been published. It
is necessary for the Cuban profes-
sors to receive permission from their
government.” _ _

Students support ban
proposed in House bill

By Kevin J. Krist
The Pitt News

The Student Government Board,
the lnterfraternity Council and the
Panhellenic Association have
banded together to support a bill
which will prohibit hazing on college
campuses.

The SGB said it would like to see
House Bill 749, which is the second
of its kind to go before the State
House of Representatives in the past
few years, passed during this session.
The bill will have a “direct impact on
the university,” according to a
memo from the Governmental
Relations Office.

The three student organizations
have launched a letter—writing
campaign designed’ to “let the
know how we feel,"
according to SGB President Luke
Kluchko.

Kluchko, a member of Pitt
fraternity Delta Tau Delta, said he
feels that hazing has been “ignored”
at Pitt, although it is not a major
problem, and added that his
fraternity already enforces penalties
for hazing, thereby discouraging
such activity.

Thenew bill, which defines hazing
as “any action  which recklessly or
intentionally endangers the mental
or physical health or safety of a
student,” would make hazing a
third-degree misdemeanor and
forces each school offering an

associate degree or higher within the
commonwealth to adopt a written
anti-hazing policy. This policy
would include such penalties as
fines, withholding of diplomas or
transcripts, suspension" and
disbanding of the organization in
question.

The University of Pittsburgh has
had a written anti-hazing policy
since 1979, according to Bridget
Guernsey, assistant director of
student activities, but some schools
in the state do not.

The fraternities and sororities
themselves also support such
-measures and have been actively
involved in the campaign from the
beginning when Craig Straussiand
Laura Ferlan, presidents of the IFC
and Panhel, respectively, sent letters
of support to Pitt’s Governmental
Relations Office.

Strauss, who also stressed that
hazing has not been a major
problem at the university, said he
sees the bill as a “preventive
measure” rather than as a reactionto
a prevalent problem within the
fraternities. The support he has
received from the fraternities has
been encouraging. “We’re all
striving for a common goal,” said
Strauss.

The letter-writing campaign itself
consists of each of the three
organizations writing approxi
mately 300 letters encouraging
support of the bill to state
representatives.

PAT shutdown unlikely; service cuts planned,

By Joe Krzywiecki
The Pitt News

Although the threat of a shut-
down is not imminent, service reduc-
tion is possible if the Port Authority
Transit of Allegheny County does
not receive additional funding,
according to PAT spokesman James
Fink.

PAT is currently operating on a
line of credit from Mellon Bank.
Although the credit is due to expire
at the end of the month, Fink said he
was conﬁdent that PAT could get an
extention at a meeting scheduled
with Mellon Bank on June 28.

If funding is not met, cuts in ser-
vice could begin in August. Fink

said he did not know which services
would be cut but that the cuts would

9 be used as a last resort if money did

run out..

PAT‘s financial problems are due
to an inadequate operating budget.
In December l984, PAT had an $18
million deficit (Pittsburgh Press,
Dec. 2, 1984). To help ease the
deficit, PAT wants to implement a
one—percent sales tax in Allegheny
County. PAT estimates that the tax
would raise $65 million a year, half
of the tax going to municipalities.

The transit tax plan has recently
been disputed bygState Representa-
tive Ronald Gamble. Gamble’s sub-
committee report was highly critical
of the need for such a tax.

The report recommended that

“neither a one-percent sales tax nor
any other special tax should be

imposed to solve the troubled finan- V

ces of the Port Authority Transit
System.” The report addressed
charges of waste and inefficiency at
all levels.

One fourth of Gamble’s report
dealt with PAT’s labor relations.
The subcommittee’s report criticized
absenteeism and union work rules
that allegedly force PAT to place
unskilled workers in positions as
welders and mechanics instead of
hiring new and better-qualified
employees. '

The subcommittee report made a
total of 19 recommendations to
labor and management. If negotia-

tions fail over the next year, Gamble
plans to introduce legislation to dis-
solve the authority and place the
transit system under the county’s
control.

James Roddey responded to the
claims of mismangement on Friday,
saying that the subcommittee report
is “not an accurate representation of
our efforts to solve the financial cri-
sis.” Roddey added that eight of the
19 recommendations made in the
report were put‘into effect. He also
stressed the need for cooperation
between the union, state and PAT
board of directors if the problems
are to be solved.

Financial problems. have not
always plagued PAT. From 1964 to

\

l975, PAT enjoyed prosperity and
expansion as it increased its service
to accommodate the suburban hous-
ing and shopping center boom. With

ample federal and state funding, i

PA] was able to service areas that
previously had no access to public
transportation.

In the mid-70s, however, PAT
faced federal cutbacks in aid which,
coupled with inﬂation and increased
fuel costs, forced PAT to raise fares
and incorporate service reductions.

The trend continued into the
l980s when PAT raised fares in both
I98] and I982. A further blow was
dealt PAT in I982 when the reces-
sion led to a decline in the number of
riders.

Mesa-Lago said he would like to
see more of Cuba's professors pub-
lished in Cuban Studies as part of his
planned exchange program.

The final area of exchange will be
a student exchange, for both under-
graduate and graduate students

The student exchange program
will be based on a competition and
selection process, from which l2 to
15 students will win a partial fellow-
ship for study in Cuba. The students
will take an intensive language
course, followed by a seminar
focused specifically on Cuba. In the
seminar, students will design a
research project to be carried out
during a two-month stay in Cuba.

“The issue of student exchange is
very sensitive,” Mesa-Lago said.
“Students are expected to live in
family homes, but because of food
rationing it may be difficult to
arrange for their meals.”

This and other details will be
worked out in the next six months
through the joint efforts of Pitt’s
Center of Latin American Studies
and the department for the study of
the United States at the University
of Havana.

Financial arrangements are also
being worked out. “We have sent a
letter to the Ford Foundation,"
Mesa-Lago said, “in hopes that they
will help us. Once specific research
projects have begun, we will

iJLnQEi2;i¢85

approach foundations that special-
ize in the subject of research.”

After seven years of work, Mesa-
Lago’s program is finally materializ-
ing. He said he believes that Posvar’s
visit was the final breakthrough,

“Several of our faculty members
have traveled to Cuba in the past
seven years,” Mesa-Lago said, “but
Dr. Posvar was the first university
president to go to Havana since the
Cuban revolution.” 7

Mesa-Lago said he is very optim-
istic about the proposed exchange.
“I am happy,” he said. “It took a
long time, but I feel that the
exchange is a preliminary instru-
ment to work out something
exciting.”

National student group battles
Reagan's proposed budget cuts

By Adam Eisenstat
Staff Writer

The Reagan administration’s
compromise, presented in an April
25 speech, called for an $836 million
cut in student aid in fiscal year 1986
and cuts totaling $3.1 billion over
the next three years. One
Washington-based lobbying group,
the United States Student Associa-
tion, has made fighting those budget
cuts its principal issue.

The USSA was founded in I978 as
a merger of the National Student
Association and the National Stu-
dent Lobby, which are education-
oriented lobbies.

According to Legislative Director
Kathy Ozer, one of five salaried staff
members of USSA’s Washington
office, education issues have
changed greatly since the National
Student Association was founded in
1947.

“The major issue in the last l0 or
20 years,” said Ozer, “is student aid.
Before then it [aid] didn’t exist.” She
said the USSA also focuses on
enforcement of civil rights laws on
campus.

Ozer said the USSA is primarily a
volunteer organization that works
closely with student governments,
professors and coalitions, including
such groups as the National Educa-
tion Association and the American
Federation of Teachers. “The USSA
works mostly ona grass roots stra-
tegy, best seen in our work on cam-
puses and coalitions," said Ozer.

The USSA, along with its five
salaried employees and interns in

When you're on to a good thing
S’riCk with if!

Washington, is operated by a stu-
dent board of directors, regional
board members, task forces and cau-
cuses. This strategy, Ozer said,
allows the USSA to diffuse its inﬂu-
ence throughout the country while
holding down costs and retaining a
national office.

Ozer stressed that the USSA is
committed to fighting student aid
cuts because “many people's access
to a college education is based on
their ability to get loans and other
government aid. Student aid is quite
clearly a small part of the federal
budget —- one percent — and should
not be cut. But as it stands, funding
for higher education has declined 20
percent in real dollars in the last four
years.”

In response to the frequent com-
plaint that student aid is often a
government handout that serves no
immediate long-term practice pur-
pose, Ozer said: “People are work-
ing more than ever to pay for their
college education. Student aid is
generally inadequate to cover the

pital, in conjunction with faculty
members of the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine, has
expanded its bone marrow trans-
plant program to include an allo-
genic bone marrow transplant
procedure.

The new procedure involves re-
moving a portion of a donor's bone
marrow for immediate transplanta-
tion to the patient. However, before
this can take place, the donor must
have a matching HLA type to be
able to donate marrow. By using a
sibling as a donor, the rejection rate
of the newly implanted marrow is
greatly reduced.

Previously, only autologous bone

marrow transplants had taken place
at the hospital. The autologous
method involves extracting a por-
tion of the patient’s own bone mar-
row, which is treated with a drug to
remove leukemic cells. The marrow
is then frozen until it is needed by the
patient.

The actual transplant procedure is
done by harvesting two to three
pints of blood and bone marrow
mixture from the siblings ilium -
the major bone in the pelvis. The
donated marrow is then trans-
planted into the patient. The mar-
row takes about two to three weeks
to grow and produce new red cells,
white cells and platelets. The entire

the remainder of the treatment.

“This added dimension to the
bone marrow transplant component
of the University Health Center's
internationally recognized trans-
plant programs provides residents of
the area with convenient access to
the latest techniques in bone marrow
transplant procedures and avoids
the necessity of traveling to other

As a result of Shadduck‘s research
and his involvement in the study and
treatment of patients with aplastic

Business school plans to upgr

By Nadia Moritz

Features Editor

In an attempt to boost competi-
tiveness and productivity in the Uni-
ted States, the Business-Higher
Education Forum recently urged the
nation’s business schools to upgrade
their programs, speciﬁcally in the
areas of faculty development and
curriculum.

“It has been 25 years since the sub-
ject was examined systematically,"
said Richard B. Madden, chairman
and chief executive officer of Port-
latch Corporation and co-chairman
of the forum’s Advisory Committee
on Business Management Educa-
tion. “The world economy and
America’s place in it has changed
significantly since then. And the
business schools have not always
kept pace.”

The Business-Higher Education

Forum, founded in I978 and con-
sisting of the chief executives of 9l
leading U.S. corporations, universi-
ties and colleges, conducts semi-
annual round-table discussions to
act on issues relating to the current
and future requirements of business
and higher education. These discus-
sions also serve to develop the rela-
tionship between corporate America
and institutions of higher learning.
University President Wesley Posvar
represents Pitt in the forum.

The most recent report, “Ameri-
ca’s Business Schools: Priorities for
Change,” was a follow-up on a study
called “America’s Competitive
Challenge: The Need for a National
Response,” a report that the forum
submitted to President Reagan in
May I983 that stressed the need for
improvement of American industry
and workers in order to compete in
markets at home and abroad.

forum’s business school report
include alternative core curricula
with a “real world" orientation,
greater interdisciplinary teaching
and research, and more emphasis on
interpersonal relations and strate-
gies for faculty development as well
as joint ventures with other parts of
the university.

According to H.J. Zoffer, dean of
Pitt’s business school and a member
of the forums Quality of Business
Management Education Advisory
Committee, all of the recommenda-
tions will be or have already been
implemented into Pitt’s business
school, but the focus will be on the
immersing of faculty into the busi-
ness world: and executives into
academia.

Unlike many schools, according
to Zoffer, Pitt’s business faculty is
involved with consulting, but this is
not enough.

In terms of bringing the execu-

adeprogram

tives into the classrooms, Zoffer said
that Pitt's Graduate School of Busi-
ness already has representatives
from all corporations in the area,
and with a recent $2 million grant
from IBM, it will be expanding this
part of the program.

Also, relations with companies
such as U.S. Steel and Bethlehem
Steel, according to Zoffer, have
served to incorporate problem
orientation into Pitt.

Finally, in response to the forums
recommendation for business
schools to plan more joint ventures
with other university departments,
Zoffer said that the School of Busi-
ness has recently completed the
planning of a business/theology
degree and is working with the law
school to establish a joint business-
/law degree. It is also working with
the School of Public Health to
establish a business/ hospital ad min-
istration degree program.

  The Bard is back
  Romeo and Juliet kick off season

"“’“"“*'~<--»~«-w.»m..........

By Leslie M. Bennett
Staff Writer

The Sixth Annual Three Riv-
ers Shakespeare Festival’s open-
ing production of Romeo and
Juliet successfully put poetry in
motion last Wednesday at the
Stephen Foster Memorial Thea-
tre. The classic tale of star-
crossed lovers, familiar to
everyone, takes place in Verona,
Italy, where there is “much to do
with hate” between the Mon-
tagues and Capulets, and where
Romeo and Juliet, by an “inevit-
able accident” fall into tragic
love. I

The production is surprisingly
simple, yet lacking nothing in
action or dramatic imagination.
Marc Masterson, City Theatre
Company’s artistic director,
takes a traditional approach to
costume and setting, incorporat-
ing a single—stage set with
marbled pillars and balcony.
Beautifully conceived and
designed by Tony Ferrieri, the
set allows each scene to suggest
appropriate moods, with the

sloped stage giving a full view of
the floor. Scene changes are
effectively made with the slight-
est alteration of subtle lighting
and props.

Masterson directs two TRSF
newcomers, Kelly Maurer, and
David A. Baker in the leading
roles. Corresponding to Master-
son’s concept, the actors’
performances’ are equally
straight-forward and powerful.

Maurer is familiar to Pitts-
burgh audiences, having just
completed her first season with
City Theatre Company. Her
wide-eyed innocence, as Juliet,
recalls her portrayal of Angelica

in The Hypochondriac earlier.

this year. Maurer has a genuine
knack for portraying youth and
does it with mature grace and
becoming elegance.

Although Baker is new both to
the Festival and to Pittsburgh,
he proves his ability to capture
an audience’s attention with his
schoolboy charm and impressive
agility. His portrayal of Romeo
is impulsive and rambunctious,
working up a sweat with what

==Entertainment:

seems to be the uncontrollable
sexual energy of an adolescent
and the intense commitment ofa
man.

The dramatic antics of this
production combined with
Shakespeare’s eloquent imagery
require no intellectual effort to
interpret either Romeo’s exuber-
ant declarations or Mercutio’s
witty bawdiness. Robert Martini
received particularly enthusias-
tic applause for his performance
as the internally tormented
Mercutio.

Monique Morgan also
deserves recognition for her
delightfully‘ tawdry portrayal of
the Nurse. Her high-pitched,
toothless eackles put the
audience ‘in stitches through the
first act and her tender gestures
of empathy warmed the entire
theatre in the second act.

True to the structure of the
tragic play, the first act of this
three-hour production provides
the humor that sets off the grav-
ity of the second act. The play
becomes so playful at times —

tions with the Nurse — that we
are nearly allowed to forget its
fateful implications. Even the
classic balcony scene is taken
over by Romeo’s head—over-
heels displays, which take him
up to Juliet’s balcony and leaves
him there, hanging four feet off
the stage floor.

The fight scenes, choreo-
graphed by interim producing
director W. Stephen Coleman,
provided far more thanjust slap-
ping swords: it filled the stage
with action. Coleman also gave a
striking performance as Lord
Capulet. The heartbreaking final
scene ends dramatically with

PG“-'5 Ontv VIDEO JUKEBOX

with soft porn and hard rock

By Christine Curcio
Staff Writer

From the moment two buxom
girls clad in flesh-colored bikinis
took the stage, it was clear that
The Tubes were going to put on a
unique show.

In their June 8 appearance at
the Syria Mosque, The Tubes
gave the word “trashy” new
meaning. Originating in San
Francisco 10 years ago, the band
— composed of lead singer Fee
Waybill and friends -— went to
Europe to make a splash in the
music business. Their on-stage
antics in the late '70s, reminis-
cent of burlesque routines with
nudity and outrageous lyrics, are
legendary. If their Love Bomb
tour is any indication, they won’t
be letting up any time soon.

This concert truly can be
classed as entertaining. Waybill
and his two young girlfriends
made costume changes for every
song. (In the girls’ case, they
were 1ess—than-encumbering cos-
tumes.) During a tune about a
sports fan, Waybill threw a bas-
ketball, football and a couple of
softballs into the audience. As
“Sushi Girl” began, he carried
out a mermaid and whisked her
to the top of an elaborate stair-
case where the band members
made their grand entrances. A
gigantic pink octopus came out
to save her.

Though The Tubes are known

JUNE 12, I985

The Tues _

   

for their wild shows, their music
and songwriting stand on their
own. Amid all the confusion and
theatrics on-stage, the music car-
ried its own weight through a
driving beat, with Waybill’s
vocals in top form. The band
performed songs including “The
Completion Backwards Princi-
ple,” “Amnesia,” “Sushi Girl”
and “Talk to Ya Later” (an
encore). Considering the elabo-
rate stage show, I would have
been curious to see what they
would have done with “Attack of
the 50-Foot Woman.”

The crowning touch to the

show came at the beginning of

“White Punks on Dope.” Way-
bill walked down the staircase
looking like a psychedelic
Mozart in a white powdered wig,
silver spangled shirt and shiny
silver shoes with heels at least a

foot high. After Waybill led the
crowd through frenzied choruses
of “White Punks on Dope,” a
scantily clad nurse came out with
a huge hypodermic needle. Way-
bill rolled up his sleeves. As he
received the “injection,” he fell to
the floor and was carried off
ceremoniously by several of the
band members, with his gigantic
silver shoes sticking up in the air.
The crowd gave him a standing
ovation.

The Tubes rounded off the
eVening’s festivities with “She’s a

Beauty.” By the end of the show .,
there was so much activity on- i

stage that it was hard to decide
where to look. It was disappoint-
ing that the concert had to end.
Although The Tubes had played
for just over an hour, it would
have been hard to ask for or
expect much more.

Prince dies of
cancer at 68

Pittsburgh sports fans lost a true
friend Monday when Bob Prince,
the voice of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
died at Presbyterian-University
Hospital. Prince, fondly called “The
Gunner” by Pittsburgh sports fans
for his rapid-fire delivery of play-by-
play, had a career that spanned five
decades before he succumbed to
cancer at the age of 68.

Prince had undergone surgery to
remove cancerous tumors under his
tongue earlier this spring, but
returned to the Pirate broadcast
booth for the first time since 1975 on‘
May 3. The Gunner was only able to
work three ballgames before pneu-
monia sent him back to the hospital
for the last time. Prince slipped into
a coma early Monday, then passed
on late Monday afternoon.

The Gunner’s popularity among
Pittsburgh sports fans was unparal-
leled by any other media personal-
ity. Prince coined colorful baseball
expressions such as “Kiss it good-
bye!” and “Bug on the rug," and
became an institution in Pittsburgh
Pirate baseball.

BLACK DRAGON
KARATE ACADEMY

“——Sports

His association with the Pirates
ended in 1975 when radio station
KDKA, the ﬂagship station of
Pirates’ broadcast network, dis-
missed Prince amid public protests
and controversy. The Gunner will be
missed by all.

Lewis signs three
baseball recruits

Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis
announced the signing of three
Shaler High School recruits. Lewis,
entering his second year of competi-
tion in the Big East. faced the task of
replacing shortstop Paul Westwood,
Pitt’s all-time leading hitter, and
catcher Chris Jelic, a Kansas City
Royal draftee, in last week’s free
agent draft. But Lewis has already
taken steps towards filling the voids:
he has signed shortstop Mike Claus,
catcher Jeff Hackett and pitcher
Frank Merigliano.

Claus was a two-year starter and
three-year winner for Shaler and
reportedly has the ability to step
right in and play. Hacket was Sha-
ler’s leading hitter this past season

By Jim Urban

with a .355 average, and he was also
the team leader in RBIs. Also a two-
year letter winner at Shaler, Hacket
is said to be solid defensively as well
as offensively.

Merigliano is a right-hander who
is said to have a good fastball. At
Shaler, Merigliano posted an
impressive l4-0 record.

The three will remain together this
summer as part of the Shaler Ameri-
can Legion team.

Duquesne rape
saga continues

Four Duquesne University bas-
ketball players who were cleared of
rape charges two weeks ago will
stand before the school’s judicial
board this week. The players,junior
Emmett Sellers, and sophomores
Ronnie Stevenson, Gregory Harri-
son and Eric Compton waived their
right to have their case heard before
a five-member judicial board in
favor of a hearing with Dr. Dennis
Golden, the vice-president for Stu-
dent Life at Duquesne. Golden will
determine how the four should be
punished for breaking the school’s
student code of conduct.

Dugan added to
women's hoop staff

By Mike Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

University of Pittsburgh
women’s basketball head coach
Kirk Bruce has named Carol
Dugan as his top assistant coach.
The two had worked as assistants
last season under former head
coach Judy Saurer, who resigned
the position in April.

Dugan began a close associa-
tion with the Pitt program as a
starting guard from I979-82 and
is looking forward to her fourth
season as assistant coach. “I’m
close to Pitt, I know Pitt, and I
want to do a good job here,” she
said. ‘‘I’m very excited about
working with Kirk. We have
great respect for each other, and
I know that we will work well
together.”

Dugan’s past duties included
being in charge of the defense as
well as aiding in recruiting and
on-the-floor coaching. She will
now have an expanded role in
those areas, including a more
active hand in recruiting.
“Recruiting will be one of my
major responsibilities,” she said.
“Specifically we want to be more
involved in public relations with
the local high schools and keep
some of the talent in Pittsburgh.”

Bruce said he feels Dugan’s
strengths as a coach lie in three
areas. “She has outstanding
knowledge of the game, and she’s
a great practice coach," he said.
“Her personality will enable her
to be a good recruiter.

“She also has a great relation-
ship with the players on the team
now, and the fact that she played
on the Division I level and was
noted as a hard worker will help _

with the younger players.”

 

Carol Dugan

As a Lady Panther starting
guard for four years, Dugan was
known for her tenacious defen-
sive play. She was often assigned
to the opposing team’s best
offensive player. Her smooth
outsidejump shot enabled her to
score 609 career points and finish
10th on the Lady Panther all-
time leading scorers list. She was
voted as the team MVP in l982
and was the female recipient of
the Panther Award for outstand-
ing athletic achievement.

Dugan had a reputation as a
team player, and because of the
youth and inexperience of this
year’s team, she feels that team
work will be a necessity. I ‘

“I prided myself on the fact
that I was a team player, and I
think that's how we want this
team to feel,” she said. “If we
play with pride and unselfish-
ness, and we’re ready to play as
soon as we step onto the floor, I '
think we can win games.”
