Dr. Taube Speaks on Writing Chancel1or’s Reception
For At-Home—at—Pitt Program

by DIANE MCDONALD
“The pain didn’t matter:
he had his triumph. But then
there would be another chal-

lenge . . . tomorrow . , , or
Easter . . or Christmas
again . . .” As he finished

reading “The Professional,”
Dr. Myron Taube leaned on
back in his chair, stretched

, out his legs and glanced around

quickly at the 12 students seat-
ed in his living room.

Dr. Myron Taube, associate
professor of English at the Uni-
versity, hosted Tuesday night’s
‘ At-Home-at-Pitt” program in
his home in Monroeville. Spon-
sored -by the campus YWCA,
the informal meeting began with
an evaluation of the fiction pub-
lished in Playboy, In, Seventeen,
and the Atlantic Monthly mag-
azines, and branched out to cov-
er some of the campus literary
quarterlies across the country.
“Playboy,” h-e stated, “prdbably
has the best modern ﬁction” of
the present popular magazines.
Dr. Taube has had -short stories
published -in The University of
Kansas Review, Discourse, The
Minnesota Review, and had re

cently -sold a story to In maga-
zine.

As the students -sat drinking
coffee and eating pieces of Mrs.
Taube’s homemade cake, Dr.
Taube read five of his stories
to us: “Just You Wait, Leonard
Dorfman, Just You Wait,” “Mar-
go,” “The Bunny,” “The Profes-
sional,” and “Bach Is for the
Loving Kind.” A question and
answer period followed each
readling. , C

One editor, he told us, had
sent him a rejection letter say-
ing that while one story was
very frightening, she didn’t be-
lieve it. “This is a contradiction
in itself,” he stated, “because
when you are reading a story
your are having an experience
which, difficult as it is to deﬁne,
is real.” For that short time in
which someone reads a story,
he is inside it, feeling it, and
believeing it. -‘

“Writing is an art which has
to be learned.” Dr. Taube is «pre-
sently trying to teach this art
to freshmen in his composition
course this term. In his second
year at the University, he has
taught English 80 and courses
in modern poetry. Asked wheth-
er would be interested in dis-

Posvar Explains State Ties

As Greek Fete Honors Him

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar told students and alumni Wednes-
day that there is much misunderstanding of the state-related status
of the University. He emphasized that state support for main-
tenance presently constitutes only 13 per cent of the University’s

operating budget.

Also, the $16 million tuition subsidy merely replaces funds
that would have come in hsad tuition remained the same. Most of

the University’s funds, continued Posvar, must come from other ‘

sources than state.

Dr. Posvar made the comments at a dinner in his honor in
the Union Ballroom. The dinner, sponsored by Interfraternity Coun-

cil ‘and -Panhellenic Council, was
attended by students from every
Greek organization and by dis-
tinguished alumni and guests.

The Chancellor remarked that
the problem of the hold-up of
state funds was not the only
problem facing the University.
Another one he mentioned that
drew a laugh from the audience
is “How to maintain our win-
ning streak in football.”

Norm McLeod, University trus-
tee, preceeded lDr. Posvar’-s re-
marks with comments on the
values of the fraternity system.
He noted that fraternity life
provides a “perpendicular struc-
ture” that provides for interac-
tion between classes and gives
continuity to a university's
alumni.

John D. Sheppard, an alum-
nus of Phi Gamma Delta fra-
ternity, -and George W. Stewart,
an alumnus of Phi Delta Theta
fraternity, also spoke to the ap-

V p oximatelyi  guest-s.

Viet Official Here

Asks That (HS Leave

by HOBART HARRIS

Not every non-Communist South Vietnamese welcomes
US presence in his country. One who doesn.’t, Le Phu Nahm,
deputy chief of An Xuyen Province, is now visiting at the
University at the Graduate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs (GSPIA). Speaking at an informal luncheon
with a group of GSPIA students, Le explained why he felt
that South Vietnam would be better off if America limited its as-
sistance to foreign aid. “

Le's basic point was that he felt that the South Vietnamese
are perfectly capable of winning the war themselves. In fact, he
indicated that the entry of American assistance in the form of
soldiers was a direct cause of the deterioration of the South Viet-
namese position since 1961.

He observed that in order to ﬁght well, a man must believe
in what he is ﬁghting for. By Am-ecricanizin-g the war, we have
created the idea in the minds of the South Vietnamese that their
vital interests are no longer paramount «in the war. Rather, they
feel it is the US that stands to gain from the defat of the Viet Cong.

Further, this knowledge that the US larmy is the most impor-
tant participant in their war hinders the growth of South Vietna-
mese nationalism. As Le asked, how can the citizens of a country
identitfy with their nation when they are convinced that their coun-
try is no more than the creature of another?

However, the American presence has the opposite effect on
the North Vietnamese Le pointed out. He observed that our bomb-
ing has led to a strengthening of the North Vietnamese’s sense of
national unity and purpose. To them, we are invaders, enemys of
their state. This feeling, in turn,
strengthens Ho Chi Minh, the
Communist leader of North Viet-
nam, in a war whose intention
is to defeat Communism.

 

ed in becoming more acquainted
with SG may attend a “SG Get-
Together" to inform interested
students of how SG operates.
Included in the program will
be executive reports, SG com-
mittee reports, and the oppor-
tunity to meet and talk with
President Ken Frederick, Vice-
president Thom-as Meisner, and
SG senators and other members.
The meeting is aimed especially
at those students who signed
the SG list at the Activities Fair

COFFEE HOUSE OPENS

Students interested in per-
forming at “The Pit” coffee
house on Tuesday, Wednesday
or Thursday evenings should
apply at the Union Informa-
tion Center for an audition.

 

Le said that he felt that the
people in Vietnam, even on the
village level are politically
-aware, and, moreover, they are
“democratic.” Their most fer-
vent wish is for -a government
that is “sincere.” The matter of
whether this government is elect-
ed or comes to power through a
coup -is of little importance.

Le said that even with the
great force‘ that we have, the
US cannot win the war at will
because of our inability to deal
with guerilla warfare. He point-
ed out that the Viet Cong de-
pend primarily on stealth, and
disband into small-size units
whenever they are threatened
by massive US sweeps, regroup-
ing to attack only when US
froces are disbersed in an effort
to ﬁnd the small Viet Cong
groups. Why not leave the ﬁght-
ing to the Vietnamese, who
think the same way as the Viet
Cong, who, after all, are Viet-
namese too?" he asked.

   

Chapel will also be open tonight
from 9 to 10 p.m.

Tomorrow morning at 10 in J

the SU Ballroom, a forum of
six will discuss the topic “Mari-
juana —- Why Not?” Panelists
will be: Herbert McGibbeny,
dean of men; Father Joseph
Kennedy, Catholic chaplain; Dr.
Douglass Thompson, director of
Student Health Service; Gab-
raiel Edwards, an undergraduate
and a Student Government (SG)
senator; Godfrey Guest, a grad-
uate student in the School of So-
cial Work; and Robert Aarons,
a social. worker. The forum is
open to all parents and under-
graduates.

The Pitt Panthers will meet
the University of Miami at Pitt
St-advium tomorrow afternoon.
Kick-off will be at 1:30. The re-
served» -student section will be
expanded to accommodate stu-
dents and their parents.

All dorms and fraternity and
sorority houses will host open
house following the game.

.‘War Game’ Is Fine,

Startling Documentary

Peter Watkin’s The War
Game could be the most im-
portant film of the l96’s
or for that matter, the twen-
tieth century. Originally
produced by the BBC, the
ﬁlm was judged to beitoo harsh
for tellevision audiences. I think
it should have -been shown. It
deals with atomic warfare, a
subject that we all try to re-
press and never take seriously.
And as the ﬁhn points out, we
do ignore it succe-ssfuly. That is,
until it happens.

The War Games takes a hy-
pothetical but credible situation.
In the middle of September,
some year before 1980, the Chi-
nese invade South Vietnam, the
USSR and Germay, “as a ges-
ture Of "Communist solidarity,”
attempt to occupy West Berlin.

— Because or the constant clashes

in. the next few days, Britain
eivacuates its urban population

to the less vulnerable rural .

areas. Nobody panics; nobody
takes the possibility of nuclear
bombing -seriously.

A nuclear attack is unleashed

- urpon Britain within the next

week, catching the majority of
people completely defenseless.
One-third to one-half of the Bri-
tish population either die or are
seriously wounded by‘ the blasts.
Medical facilities and food sup-
plies are scarce. Only some of
the wounded can be saved while
the others are either left to die
without medication, or are shot
to relieve their 5 suffering. The
-dead are too numerous to bury,
so mass cremations are perform-
ed to control disease.
Htmger,‘ riots and anarchy"
evolve within the next few
weeks; only those who behave
themselves are issued food. Even
by the formation of a dictatorial
states does not ‘quell the many
sporatic outbursts. By Christ-
mas, “Silent Night” playing in

are completely apathetic to the
‘people around them, and each
-person lives within his own lit-
tle shell of misery.

throughout the entire movie:
Nuclear war is very possible.
With a slight intensiﬁcation of
political conﬂict, nuclear war
may be a reality before 1980.
Nevertheless, we continue play-
ing games, -having nice little
wars, and never think for a mo-
ment that .a total nuclear holo-
caust is possible. ‘

The War Game is uncomfort-
able, shocking, and sometimes
u~n'bea=rable. It is not a nice little
picture, nor does it try to be
nice to the audience. When the
ﬁlm becomes philosophical, Wat-
kins states that tech-nically man
is living in the nuclear age, but
emotionially, he is still living in
the stone age.

The War Game is not a pretry
film, it is not entertaining, and
it is crude, raw and unpollished
What you are leﬁt with are 60
minutes of naked realism and
a movie that is a must to see.

University Police

New Guard Talks About Job 0'

by JILL SPITALNY
If you think the Univers-
ity policeman is a mean guy
who would give you a ticket

for kissing your girl good- I

night in a “no parking”
zone, you’Ve never spoken
to Harry Bolton, the man who
guards the quadrangle from 3
to 11 p.m. every day.

A retired Navy brig warden,
Bolten claims he ﬁnds no rela-
tionship between Pitt students
and his former prisoners. “As a
matter of fact," he said, “the
"prisoners were easier to han-
dle.” By this he merely means
that he knew them longer and
better and it was more -like :2
big family situation.

As for the Pitt students, Bal-
ton thinks they're a “pretty
goo-d group.” Although only here
three months, he's had no "trou-

ble with the girls (except for '1
senior assistant who he once
-asked to get him a piece of ap-
ple pie and never returned, and
very little with the boys. “Prob-
ably the students that give me
the most trouble are the for-
eign ones—~they think I know
everything.”

When asked about his job, Bol-
ton said he had no major com-
plaints. Although the hours are
poor, he feels his location in the
quad makes the time go quick-
ly. There he gets to know many
of the students who live in the
dorms, as well as their daily
visitors. “There’s always some-
one to talk to. If you think this
job gets boring, come see me
between 8:30 and 9:30 any Fri-
day or Saturday evening?’

One thing Bolton can’t under-
stand is why some couples
spend the whole evening neck-

ing in parked cars in the quad.
Why don’t they go into the
date lounges,” he asked, “where
they can’t get a ticket?” He did,
however, emphasize that the
number of tickets and towaways
are small. “Most of them are
people who have been repeated-
ly warned and ‘refuse to listen.”
As a matter 0-f fact, the only
thing Bolton would change if he
could would be the ‘parking
rules. He would like to restrict
parking at all hours to 20 min-
utes per person. Aside from this
problem of insufficient parking,
Bolton truly enjoys all aspects
of his work here. The students
are, according to him “very re-
ﬁned.” They make my job a lot
easier and more pleasant than

it could be.”

‘ National Peace Group  

Marches To Pentagon

The National Mobilization
to End the War in Vietnam
is stronger now than it ever
was. The peace group can
thank the federal General
Services Administration
(GSA)

In an ultimatum iissued by
Harry Van Cleve, GSA counsel,
on Oct. 6, it was stated that gov-
ernment permission for the Oct.
21 march would be granted only
if Mobilization disavowed its
support for civil diso‘bedience at
the Pentagon. .

The ultimatum, ending a long

series of stalls by the federal

government, may have been in-
tended to split or moderate the
march. But it backﬁred.

Instead, it rallied support for
the march, which had previously
been divided into factions. The
public became aware of the pos
sibility that the government
would refuse citizens their con-
stitutional rights of protest and
assembly. A

The Mobilization administra-
tive committee, iincluding more
than 100 separate groups, re-
sponded immediately to GSA’s
ultimatum by voting una~n~imo~us-
ly to continue to support the
civil disobedience.

“The ultimatum inspired us
miilitancy and unity,” said proﬁ-
ect co-director Jerry Rubin.

Some groups which had shown
little interest in the march be-
came interested in the prospect
of an “illegal” mass protest.
Such groups as the Committee
for Independent Political Ac-
tion (CIPA) of New York’s Up-

' per West Side, Students for a
~~ . Democratic Society (SDS), and

\Vomen Strike for Peace have
added their support to the move-
ment.

Rev. William Sloane Coffin of

of attracting mothers and chil-
dren who might be ‘hurt by po-
lice, have decided to speak at
the rally.

Inspite of a GSA reversal of
its Oct. 6 ulitimatum, «that is, a
permit for the march, the Mobil-
ization will still be larger and

different in spirit. The groups '

are uniﬁed now and will not
back down.

Tentatively, the ﬁrst rally is
scheduled for Saturday at 11

ly after it. After crossing Ar-

ers may go to the ‘Pentagon via

‘Turcaret’ Plays in Oakland  

The Departments of the
French-Italian and the Uni-
versity Theater, in associa-
tion with Mt. Mercy College,
will present the Le Treteau
de Paris vroduction of Tull‘-
caret. The play will be per-
formed in French at Anton-
ian Hall, Mt. Mercy College,
Monday at 8:30 p.m. _

Tickets for the play are $2 for
students, $3.50 for general ad-
mission. Tickets are on sale at
the Student Desk on the ground
ﬂoor of the Cathedral and at
-the Book Center. The box office
in Antonian Hall will be open
only after 7:30 p.m. «on the night
of the performarnce.

The play, by Alain Rene Les-
age, was the -ﬁ-nst important
piece of French literature to
treat man and money, accen-
tuating money. The play has no
moral; it was written by a hum-
orist and provides -a satirical
comment on the events of the
early 18th Century.

The three leading roles will
be played by Arlette Tephany,
Jean-Jacques Legarde, and Vic-
tor Garrivier, all of the La Com-
pagnie La Guilde, Paris reper-
tory troupe. These actors with-
stand the rigors of one-night
stands in the United States and
in Canada. They are comparable
in stature in France to Broad-
way stars. V

The Le Treteau de Paris pro-
duction of Turcaret is one of »
three productions to tour North
America during the 1967-68 sea.-
son. The Le Treteau de Paris
tours are sponsored by the
French Government.

lian Languages and Literatures,

ed representatives of the student body. Unfortunately, the current ad-
ministration has only a few more months in office. But they can still set
a precedent by fully utilizing the remaining time. This requires more
cooperation I between the executive and the legislative branches than

Our student activities are traditionally run by a -small group of

1 people, but obviously this state of affairs is not the most desirable one.
For this reason we ureg students to avail themselves of the opportunities
provided «by -Student Government (SG) to participate in this vital or-

ganization.

SG can only work «at its maximum effectiveness if there is greatly
increased participation in its programs by not only members of the stu-
dents body but our elected representatives, the senators. All too often
‘the senators represent the student body too well by reflecting one un-

desirable characteristic——-apathy.

We do -not measure participation in terms of how many times a
senator speaks at an SG meeting. This requires little preparation and
is often more distracting than helpfuﬂ, asthe senators waste time dealing
with relatively insigniﬁcant issues. Perhaps they do not have the facts

. before them to grapple with the more important issues of concern. If
this is the case, then they should attend the weekly meetings the SG

The Parking Problem
- A Ridiculous Situation

by Dan Litchenstein

Is it trite to bring up the
old parking problem again?

. It’s an ancient, worn-out

gripe that resembles a com-
plaint about the weather:

V nothing is ever done about

the situation. People will
always complain about the

*- weather because nothing can
“ever be done about it. That,

perhaps is trite. But is it

, also trite to complain about

a more down to earth prob-
lem, just because it looks as

if nothing will ever be done

about that either?

' The parking problem,
like most other problems of
the University has, is a re-

sult of too many people and

not enough facilities. There
are approximately 21,000

 students here, graduate as

well as undergraduate.

l About 1600 of these stu-

dents live in the dorms. Ob-
viously not all 19,400 non-
dorm residents will be look-
ing for a parking space at
the same time on the same
day. But at least a few
thousand wi‘ll, along with
visitors, faculty members
and University employees.

The ensuing situation is ri-
diculous. Compare it to over
100 students trying to regis-
ter for one course with. thir-
ty openings. This is hardly
a new-problem.

How many students have
been late for class because

they had to cruise around.

for 15 minutes for a park-
ing space only to return to
their car later to find park-
ing tickets? These messag-
es from the lovely ladies in
green are the essence of the
whole problem.

In this, the ticket depart-
ment, the parking situation
has a new twist this year.
It is no secret that out of
state drivers do not pay
their Pennsylvania parking
tickets. They can run up
hundreds of dollars worth
of tickets before the city
police will take the time to
trace their regi'strations
through their home states.
This is not really a prob-
lem either; a New Yorker
can collect his tickets and
paper his apartment wall
with them and never worry

Both sides must forget their real or imagined grievances against
one another and get to the issue at hand: representing the student body. .
This- they have not effectively done. Their effort has been a surface ef-
fort, with bills being passed but not followed through. If SG would col-
lectively decide which two or three issues are most important and probe

them in depth, it would accomplish far more than it is now doing, as

few senators are currently actively involved in exploring key issues.

SG is the only organization on this campus that represents the
entire body. Its assignment is overwhelming, but it can lose their effec-
tiveness so eastily by sidestepping the issues and allowing senators to
castigate one another or the executive branch. We urge the SG executive
branch to work more closely with the senators to achieve more substan-

tial goals. We also urge students who are interested in SG to attend its

about the police.

But this is an election
year, and a certain consta-
ble is picking up brownie
points for re-election by
making a list of those with
more than four parking tic-
kets and seeking out the of-
fenders. This sneaky offi-
cial even has a search war-
rant to allow him into gar-
ages or fraternity house
-parking lots. I know of sev-

eral out of staters he has hit I

for well‘ over $100. A few
years ago, a boy was yanked
right out of a class and ‘ar-
rested forhis parking vio-
lations.

This is not unfair, for the
ticket collectors are break-
ing a law, no matter how‘
minor it may be, and they
should be punished. What
is unfair is the situation
that forces them to break
the law in the first place.
A student can’t leave a three
hour lab or a similarly long
activity obligation every
half hour to go push an-
other nickel into his park-
ing meter. How: many peo-
ple carry enough nickels to
feed a meter throughout a
full day of classes anyway?

A commuter can’t carry
his Chevy into the Cathe-
dral, so if he has two min-
utes to make a class and
there are no parking spaces
available, he usually has no
choice but to park illegally.

A.n important lecture or?

mid term is more important
than a five dollar parking
ticket, especially when
chances are he won’t pay it.

But it does no good to
complain about a bad situ-
ation without presenting a
solution. We know the Uni-
versity has financial prob-
lems because of the mess in.
the state legislature, so we
can’t expect it to level build-
to convert to into acres of
parking . space.

But the University and
the city can at least give the
student a fighting chance.
There are some four hour
parking meters in the area,
but not enough. Far fewer
tickets would be collected
is the meters around the
Cathedral and dorms were

planned sessions. For only maximum participation and a united effort
can really get the job done.

Raps Stanton

Edi.tor, The Pitt News:

The opinion column entitled
“The Wearing of the White, a
Symbol of What?” by Doug
Stariton, which appeared in the
Oct. 9 issue of your newspaper
u»nfa.in1y v’-iliﬁes the character
and motivation of those involved
in the anti-Vietnam War protest.
Mr. Stanton implies that those
who are wearing the white arm
bands are exhibitionistic fresh-
men, narcissistic showoffs, or
“confused” people. Yet beyond
this superﬁcial labeling there
seems to have been little seri-
ous investigation into what real-
ly matters, i.e., what these peo-
ple believe. Might not one of
these freshmen actual.ly dis-
agree with US policy in Viet-

converted to the nickel-
dime-quarter machines like
those on Bayard Street.

If the University does
not have the funds to build
a garage for students, can’t
it at least arrange to have
student rates in the exist-
ing garages? There are stu-
dent rates for everything
else in the world. When the
University does get the mon-
ey, it would be well worth
while to take over one of
the nearby garages.

Forbes Avenue’ is as wide
as Fifth and there hould be
no reason why at least a
few spaces can’t be added
adjacent to the Cathedral
and beyond. The inner quad
behind Holland Hall has
been available for parking
until this year. If the ad-
ministration insists upon
closing this area during the
day, I would like to hear a
good reason why it can’t be
opened at night. Every lit-
tle space helps.

There are many solutions;
some are feasible, some are
not. But the University, if
not the city, must act upon
somethi'ng. The parki.ng
situation, like too many oth-
ers, will get worse before it
gets better, or at least be-
fore the University has
more funds to work with.
Until then, at least once a
year, someone will publicly
complain about the prob.
lem. And until that some-
thing 18 done, the complaint

n'a.m, and might not he also be
gravely appalled -and monally
ashamed of his country’s ac-
tions? If in the process he does
“shock his parents” or “impress
his friends,” this is more a side
effect, and perhaps a needed
one.

Mr. Stanton does admit that
there are people who have giv-
en serious thoughrt to the war
and then have decided -to wear
an armband. However, he then
accused this group of having
surrendered. I would like to ask,
“Surrendered to what?” To their
moral conviction-s? To a doc-
trine of not killing and not be-
ing killed in defense of a policy
the goals of which are hardly
clearly deﬁned. If one can “sur-
render” to such principles, then
I think such surrender is not
only j-ustiﬁed -but also manda-
tory.

To further state, as Mr. Stan-
ton does, that “the US is aiding
the people of ‘S. Vietnam to de-
fend themselves against a mi-
nority of domestic communists
and a large number of invaders
from N. Vietnam” is a half-
tru-th. Prof. George McT. Kahin
of Cornell in the Oct. 14 issue of
The New Republic states that
-the US pacification program is
failing miserably. The Viet Cong
have succeeded in maintaining
widespread peasant support in
the South even in the face of
the p-aciﬁoation effort. US efforts
in many ways are alienating
the peasants -and certainly are
not protecting [them from com-
munism.

Mr. Stanton ﬁnally supports
his point of View with a series
of ostatements which are hardly
inforrned -and totally ‘irrational
He says, “Civilians are killed, as
in any War, but no one kills
them like the Viet Cong does. ’
He describes the US Iastr-ocities
as “m-iniscu1e.” Yet I cannot
make a -differentation between
Viet Cong torturing and US na-
palm bombings of civ-ilian vil-
lages, especially when these
bombings have been document-
ed by US civillian observers to
have occurred far from any
North Vietnamese military in-
stal-lation.

I ‘think that such columns as
Mr. Stanton’s do little to en-
courage the serious considera-
tion «of alternatives in settling
the war. Instead he manages to
stir up the Wrath of those who
are deeply committed to ending
the co-nﬂict. As such, opinions
like his have no place in a ra-
tion-al, intelligent discussion.

new ﬁeld.

Biomedical engineering, In

such developments as the arti-

versity conference has been
jointly organized and sponsored
by the Schools of Engineering
and Medicine, and is ﬁnanced
by .a grant from the Pittsburgh
Foundation. ..

The program will not concen-
trate on topica.l problems and
successes in the b-iomedical en-
gineering ﬁeld; instead, in four
sessions, conferees will deal with
a number of basic questions:

i > What are the communication

problems between the life

scientists and the engineers?‘

-> How can today's unmanage-
able problems be conquered
in the next decade?

> What should be the new goals

THERE ARE NO BAD TEACHERS; A
THERE ARE ONLY BAD STUDENTS

The academic year has only just begun and already
one thing is clear: you're not ready for college.

What, then, should you do? Should you throw up your
hands and quit? I say no! I say you must attack, grapple,
cope! I say America did not Become the world's leader in
motel construction and kidney transplants by running
away from a ﬁght! »

To the question then: You say you're not ready for col-
lege. You're too green, too naive. You lack maturity.

Okay, the answer is simple: get mature. How? Well
air, to achieve maturity you need two things:

a) a probing mind;

b) a vest.

A probing mind will be quickly yours if you'll remem-
ber that education consists not of answers but of ques-
tions. Blindly accepting. information and dumb] .
memorizing data is high school stuff. In college you don. t
just accept. You dispute, you push, you pry, you chal-
lenge. If, for instance, your physics prof ‘says, “E equals
mv<;7}slq1'1!ared,” don’t just write it down. Say to the prof,
I‘ y 1) ‘

This will show him two things :

:1) Your mind is a keen, thrusting instrument.

b) You are in the wrong major.

Ask questions, questions, and more questions. That is
the essence of maturity, the heart and liver.of education.
Nothing will more quickly convince the teachers that you
are of College calibre. And the tougher your questions,
the better. Come to class with queries that dart and "flash,
that make unexpected sallies into uncharted territory.
Ask things which have never been asked before, like

“How tall was Nietzsche?” and “Did the Minotaur have .

ticks? If so, were they immortal?" and “How often did
Pitt the Elder shave?”

  

(Incidentally, you may never know the complete an-
swer to Pitt the Elder’s shaving habits, but of one thing-
you can be positive: no matter how often he shaved and
no matter what blades he used, he never enjoyed the
shaving comfort that you do. I am assuming, of course,
that you use Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, a
logical assumption to make when one is addressing col.-
lege men—which is to say men of perspicacity, discrimi-
nation, wit, taste, cognizance, and shrewdness-for
Personna is a blade to please the perspicacious, delight
the discriminating, win the witty, tickle the tasteful,
coddle the cognizer, and shave the shrewd.

(I bring up Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades be-
cause the makers of Personna Super.‘ Stainless Steel
Blades pay me to write this column, and they are in-
clined to sulk if I omit to mention their product. I would
not like to see them unhappy, the makers of Personna,
for they are ﬁne ruddy men, fond of morris dancing and
home brewed root beer, and they make a blade that
shaves closely and cleanly, nicklessly and hacklessly, and
is sharp and gleaming and durable and available both in
double-edge style and Injector style.

(And from_these same bounteous blademakers comes
Burma-Shave, regular or menthol, a lather that out-
lathers other lathers, brother. So if you'd rather lather
better, and soak your Whiskers wetter, Burma-Shave’s
your answer.)

But I digress. We have now solved the problem of
maturity. In subsequent columns we'll take up other is-
sues, equally burning. Since 1953 when this column ﬁrst
started runninglin your campus paper, we've tackled
such thorny questions as “Can a student of 19 ﬁnd hap-
piness with an economics professor of. 90.?” and “Should
capital punishment for pledges be abolished?" and “Are
room-mates sanitary?” Be assured that in this, our 14th
year, we will not be less bold. gm-1,3... gm...

The makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blade:
(double-edge or Injector) and Burma-Shave (regular
or menthol) are pleased (or apprehensive) to bring you
another year of Max Shulman’s uninhibited, uncon-

ored: column.

g_ Segregation Survives Despite Legal Efforts

Q

 

 

by DAVID LLOYD-J ONES

(The following is a. Collegiate
P7'e.s'.s' Service news analysis of
segregation in the South.)

STRONG, Ark. (CPS) ——

Title six of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 is quite clear:
its meat takes up only four

lines of the 24 pica columns’

that laws are reproduced in.

Section 601 states, “No
person in the United States
shall, on the grounds of
race, color or national origin,
be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity
receiving Federal financial assis-
tance.”

Since -the Brown decision of
1954 established that separate
school systems are inherently
discriminatory, Section, 1 makes
it illegal to run a segregated
school system with Federal
funds — -and to supply Federal
funds to a segregated school
system.

Things are not quite so sim-
ple, however, to ex-secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
Anthony Celebrezze, to the pres-
ent HEW Secretary John Gard-
ner, and to Lyndon Baines John-
son. The .South, after all, has 153
votes in the electoral college.
These men, who are responsible
for the regulations which en-
force the Civil Rights Act, have
tortured logic to allow a plan
for desegregation and “reason-
able assurance” that it will be
carried out to qualify in the
place of desegregation for the
purposes of qualifying for fed-
eral funds.

According ‘to -CFR 45, Section
80.4, Subsection C, one of those
little cogs 0f‘Washington reality
rather less publicized than the
average proud presidential proc-
damation, the requirements of
’-the law “shall be deemed to be
satisﬁed” when a school board
or district has ﬁeld a form 441B
which assures the Commissioner
of Education it will follow a
plan to desegregate or When it is
“subject to a ﬁnal order of a
court of the United States for
. . . desegregation . . . -and pro-
vides an assurance that it will
comply with such order . . .”

In other words, it will be
treated desegregated, at the tax-
payers expense, as soon as it
has either confessed the opposite
or been found guilty at segre-

___./I

gation in a Federal court.

That the Department of Health,
Education, and Vvelfare is naive
about the results of this Alice
in Wonderland reasoning is not
to be assumed, however. In an
IIEVV brief, written by an HEVV
attorney to be heard before an
HEW hearing examiner, the pre-
cise implications of some of the
plans “deemed” in compliance
with the law are laid out:

“This means that under these
"free-choice’) plans accepted by
the Commissioner, somewhere
between 95 per cent and 99 per
cent of the Negro students (in
the South) remained isolated in
separate schools that were ori g-
inally established for the pur-
pose of segregating them from
their white neighbors and con-
temporaries. It is certain that in
at least 100 districts with ac-
cepted free choice plans, total
segregation was left completely
undisturbed by the ‘free choice‘
operation. Hardly any districts
took more than the absolute
minimum step toward faculty
desegregation, which was to de-
segregate staff meeting. Many
did not even do this.”

For HEW Secretary Gardner.
watching television in the back
o-f his blue Cadillac limousine,
of course, such a statement by
one of his own underlings does
not have muchforce.

In this rural village near the
Louisiana. border, by contrast,
the harsh reality behind the
words has an obscenity at vari-
ance witlt the complacency of
limestone Washington.

That there are men of good
will in the S~outh——even in the
tiny villages and settlements

that dot the sand and clay back
roads of Mississippi, Alabama,
Louisiana, and Arkansas —— is
an important truth. Though the
neanderthals, with their strident
idiocies ﬂooding the airwaves
and their inﬁnite capacity for
putting up roadside signs, dic-
tate much of the tone of the
South, they are a pitiful minor-
ity: the embittered old, the
threatened local oligarchs, the
more repressed of the working
class, and the scattering of pro-
fessional larynxes whose venom
is their livelihood.

But the power of the equally
tiny groupings of people com-
mitted to desegregation is easy
to overestimate. The small town-
black preacher, often the only
person informed or interested in
challenging «segregation, may
-have a grade 12 education and
receive $35 a month from his

church. His job depends on his

white emvployer. And his white
employer is likely to be not a
Klansman but a pliant reed,
bowing to the winds of opinion.

Though not everyone is a seg-
regationist, everyone assumes
that segregation is the dominant
way of life and that to move
against it is to offend. Like ju-

venile gang members who go
along with some stupid or vici-
ous action because each assumes
that the other approve of it,
Southerners continue to act out
segregation because most as-
sume that all others expect it
of them.

Su-ch a circle of habit rein-
forcement can only be broken
by a bold declaration of the un-
tru-th being lived or by someone
outside the circle stepping -in. to
break it. But for the native
Southerner, particularly in a
small town, to be the ﬁrst one
to call the segregationist mytho-
logy a lie is to be bankrupted
and ostracized.

Of the thousand people in
Strong the only man who has
the strength to do so is a mer-
ch-ant with inherited money.
That he told a woman in the
town to take her washing to the
next town it she wanted a coin-
washer that only whites used,
refusing to segregate machines
in ‘his own laundromat, co-st him
perhaps a third of his business.

It is men like this who are
betrayed, as much as the blacks,
by the administrative pieties:
“establish an administratively
feasible method of securing non-

discrimination,” “process of
transition,” “reasonable allow-
ance” and so forth.

The plight of the Southern
white liberal, however, is noth-
ing to that of the rural poor
blacks. The liberals, at least,
have their money and their good
intentions. For the blacks there
is not just despondency; there
is the progressive erosion of
the hopes built up du-ring the
so-called civil rights revolution
of the early sixties.

“The Negro has been patient,”
a Christian-Methodist-Episcopal
minister - cum - sawmill worker
will say. “In 1966, they said by
1967 we would -be all done with
this mess. Now it's 1967 and
we’re still just chewing at the
cud.”

In Strong there were 15 black
kidsuwilling to risk hostility and
failure by transferring to the
white school. All were rejected
for no apparent reason, though
the school board claimed that
“we have opened the door. Now
the culud folks just have to
walk through it.”

Last year, after the rebuff,
-there were only nine willing to

take the step. Far from snow-

Higher Education Bills Wait

" As Congress and LB] Battle

by WALTER GRANT
WASHINGTON (CPS) —-The
future of several major pro-

. rams involving higher education

remains up in the air as Con-
gress and President Johnson
continue their battle of the bud-
get.

It now appears that at least
some of the higher education
legislation still pending in Con-
gress will ‘be severely affected
by the increasing pressure on
Capital Hill for sweeping re-
ductions in the Federal budget.

The two most important bills
which Congress has not -passed
are the Higher Education
Amendments of 1967 and the ap-
prop-riat-ions for the Department
of Health, Education, -and Wel-

~ fare.

The appropriations bill —
which already has been affected
by demands for a reduced bud-
g'et—is still being worked over
by the economy-minded Con-
gress. A Congressional confer-
ence committee composed of
xnembers of the House and the
Senate recommended last week a
$13.27’ billion bill to run the De-
partments of Labor and Health,
Education, and Welfare. But the
House rejected the recommen-
dation and sent the bill back
to conference for more trim-
ming.

The conferees’ original report
contained only $13.5 million for
the Teacher Corps, far less than
the $33 million requested by
President Johnson.

The conference committee al-
so allowed no funds to support
International Education Act. Au-
thorized «in 1965, the program
has never been funded. It would
providegrants for graduate pro-
grams in international studies
and research and improvement:
in undergraduate curricula in
-international affairs. The act
also provides for the establish-
ment of the National Advisory
Committee on International
Studies. President Johnson had
requested $36.5 million for the
program.

When the House rejected the
compromise bill, it instructed
its conferees to oppose increases

' for 13 HEW programs, most of

which involve reserach projects
at the National Institutes of
Health.

In addition to the appropria-
tions bill, Congress is still con-

sidering «the Higher Education
Amendments of 1967. Hearings
on the bill are scheduled to be-
gin in the Senate within the next
few weeks.

The bill involves a number of
changes in existing higher edu-
cation laws and extends most of
these laws for ﬁve years. It ex-
tends the National Education
Act of 1965, and the National
Vocational Student Loan Insur-
ance Act of 1965. The bill also
increases interest rates for fecl-
eral loans to build college facil-
ities from 3 to 3-5°8 per cent
and authorizes grants for plan-
ning new library and informa-
tion science schools.

The Public Broadcasting Act
also is still tied up in Congress.
The bill provides for the crea-
tion of a new Public Broadcast-
ing Corporation, with a $9-mil-
lion authorization of funds for
ﬁscal 1968. The corporation
would provide grants to support
noncommercial programming on
radio and television. In addition,
the bill extends aid for educa
tional television construction for
ﬁve years, with $10.5 million
authorized this year. Another
section of the bill authorizes
$500,000 for a -study of the po-
tential of instructional televi-
sion and radio.

The broadcasting act has been
passed by both the House and
the Senate, and a conference
committee is trying to settle a
few differences in the two ver-
sions.

Hearings have been recessed
in the Senate on the first com-
plete revision of t-he copyright
laws in 58 years. The House
passed the copyright revision in
April. The bill approved by the
House exempts from copyright
limitations certain educational
uses such as facewto-face instruc-
tion, archival reproduction, and
education broadcasting.

The Senate has approved a.
bill which would create a sep-
arate education committee in
House, but not in the Senate.
The bill is now pending in the
House rules committee.

Other bills not "yet passed in-
Vl0ilVe .a new Social Science Foun-
dation and the N taional Science
Foundation. The lﬁI‘S't bill -would
establish a Social Science Foun-
dation to promote research and
scholarship in the social sci-

ences. The -"bill authorizes $29

     
  

+_.x..-

. V"

million for the ﬁrst year. The
second bill makes explicit the
National Science Foundation's
authority to support social sci-
ence and applied research.

In addition to these unpassed
bills, three important bills al-
ready have been passed by Con-
gress and signed into law.

The Education Professions De-
velopment Act, passed in June,
establishes a program for the
training of education profession-
als from nursery school teach-
ers to college administrators.
The bill also extended the Teach-
or Corps for three years.

The GI Bill Admendments
which were signed into law in
late August are designed to in.-
crease the educational beneﬁts
under the -Cold War GI Bill.
President Johnson said the in-
creases will beneﬁt 250,000 vet-
erans.

The Work-Study Program pass-
ed by -Congress provides for the
gradual reduction in the feder-
all share of work-study program
funds from 90 to 75 -per cent.

 

Study Shows Sout

low Stopping Segregation

(Continued from Page 9)
balling into complete desegrega-
tion, the haz-in-g and gentle -hints
around the town took their toll.
This year there are only four
black youngsters in the white
school, and there may be less
next year.

Two vignettes illustrate why
“free cho-ice” integration, which
depends on the black to take the
initiative of moving into the
hostile environment of the white
school, -is a vicious .and unfair
device. It is characteristic of the
method that there has to be a
thin edge of the wedge, there.
have to be some people who
will identify themselves as will-
ing to defy the old customs.

And these people expose them-
selves to retaliation and their
children to the frightening alone-
ness of being unique in the class-
rooms they desegregate. “I smell
a gar,” went the first line of an
exchange popular with white
kids in the hearing of black stu
dents. “A ceegar?” “No, a nee-
gar.” The 13-year-old who told.
me that was proud of the sense
of humor it betokened.

And for the Rev. G. L. Evans,

who “truck patches” a few acres,

outside the town, the result of
sending his children to -the white
school was a mysterious car
following the school bus to the
point where his wife met the
children every day. Not -much
of a threat, but enough to re-
mind him that a dead child is
dead forever. His children are
all back at the rambling shack
that is SChl0Ol for 500 black
youngsters.

There are 4,606 school dis-
tricts in the South. Of these just
over 3,000 are receiving Federal
funds without any question
other than the request that they
decllare that they “do not main-
tain any characteristic of a dual
school structure.” There has
been a perjury conviction for
ﬁlling in a false Form 441.

Some 337 school districts are
under court order to desegre-
gate, and HEW makes the as.
tounding assumption that there
is no need to hold fund cut-off
hearings since the overworked
Department of Justice will see
that court orders are enforced.

Boys and Girls Together

The Towers Watching Game  

by SIIERYLL ZIPPAY

If you have ever observed
ants swarming from an ant hill,
you have seen the reaction of
some University men rooming
in the towers to a light ﬂashed
from a Holland Hall window.

Within five minutes, the Tow- .

ers windows fill up with curious
observers making good use of
binoculars, telescopes, and other
such aids to vision. If a phone
n-umberpis posted in the window,
a response is almost guaranteed
to follow.

It seems that the general
opinion of these escapades is
low. “Girls who do this are
either looking for someone, are
frustrated because they sit in
their rooms every weekend, or
else they are freshmen.” In fact,,
a freshman ﬂoor in Holland did
run a dating bureau. at one time
based on phone numbers appear-
ing in windows with ﬂashing

lights. This phenomena is by no %

me-ans rare and is encouraged
by what appears in the tower
windows. For instance, during a
“religious revival” boys dec-
orated windows with crosses

and other religious symbols, ex- ‘

horting the girls to greater re-
ligious feelings.

The girls match performances
by giving leg shows. All they
have to do is shine lights on
shapely legs while standing in
their windows, covered above
the waist by their curtains.
There are also variations of
this, based roughly on the fact
that curtains can go up or down.

Girls whose rooms face the
towers have opportunities to
see a number of things. Some
of these are phone numbers.
This sometimes backfires on
-the boys, however. The girls
say that “the guys who put
their phone numbers up aren’t
the cutest and are too scared
to get dates any other way.”
However, a few girls like the
idea and actually call.

Some of the boys come up
with unbelievable signs. “Plato
was a hippie” and drawings of
sex sybols are rated highest by
the girls of Holland. A few up-
perclassmen added that “there
aren't as many signs up as pre.

vious years, and it takes away
from the general effect.” For
example, tower A's twin red
lights are outdone by a set of
red curtains in a fifth floor Hol-
land room. These curtains are
practically a University tradition
which is passed on to new room-
ers.

Because they are so close to
the other towers, the girls in
Tower C have the best view.
This allows them. to exchange
waves and sometimes post phone
numbers. While they don't need
binoculars, they do have other
problems “Living in Tower C

eon LONGO vs. JIM cox

Tomorrow, keep in mind the truism that behind every
All-American football player is a great public relations job.

If Jim Cox, receives top national recognition, credit the
Sports Publicity people at the University of Miami.

Cox is a great split end. He’s without question one of
the top ten receivers in the country. But then, so is Bob
Longo.

LONGO HAS CAUGHT" 18 passes for 241 yards. Cox
has grabbed 18 for 246. Both receivers are invariably dou-
ble—covered and sometimes triple-covered. But Cox isn’t
Miami’s only bona fide offensive threat while Longo comes
close to that description. .

“Cox is a great receiver to throw to,” says scout Bill
Lewis. “He keeps the defense honest because he’s always a
threat to go deep. But Miami’s passing attack complements
their power running game. Their quarterbacks throw just
well enough and often enough to hurt you.”

The big play to Cox is easier because of the poised
Hurricane quarterbacks and the accomplished Miami run-
ning offense. The big play to Longo is not an easy task.

COX CAUGHT ONLY ONE pass against LSU last
week, but it was for a touchdown. Miam{i’s publicists devot-
ed a full release to Cox’s prowess as a decoy, and also drum-
beated his clutch ballplaying. _ .

Longo caught seven passes last week at Wisconsin,
broke another Pitt record, was open a dozen other times,
and the only recognition he got was from his relatives,
friends and coaches. . _

Longo has ouitplayed John Wright, the pride of the
Illinois publicists. He looked considerably better than Wis-

- consin’s All-Amierican end candidate Tom McCauley. Illini 
coach Jim Valek and Badger coach John Coatta rated Longo

as “an excellent receiver,” but both refused to compare him
with their ends. . _ _ _’ “ _

If Longo has another good day against Miami s quick,
but slightly inexperienced secondary” as Lewis describes
them, and should the Panthers’ tight defensive backfield
contain Cox, Longo will truly deserve to be pushed for All-
American honors. _ _

AND IF THE‘ PANTHERS can avoid making “_the big
mistake,” as Miami opponents /are prone to commit, they

will have a shot at the Hurricanes.

Game time ha.s finally ar-

State today, the confident
freshman football team gets its
chance to prove just how good
it actually is.

‘It’s a matter of pride for

Assistant Coach J ohn Rosen-
berg.

It’s also a matter of depth.

“It’s tough to lose three good
players,” in 0 a n e d Rosenberg.
“We were going to move Bell
Beinecke from offense to de-
fense, but with Leary out. we
can’t.”

The defensive line will still
have plenty of beef with co-cap-
ta-ined Howard Broadhead (6-5,
245) and John Stevens (6-3,230)
at tackle, and Bruce Harkiewicz
(63,215) and Bill Kennedy (6-6,
225) at ends.

Lloyd Weston, Ralph Cind-
rich, and Dave McGrath well do
the linebacking. McGrath (6-3,
215) is replacing Wozniak who
still hasn’t recovered from an
ankle injury that he suffered
in practice last week.

The secondary will consist of
Bill Pietrantonio, Charlie Hall,
Bill Ramos, and Bryant Salter,
Dave Havern, who started the
fist game should also plenty of
action.

The powerful offense that
scored 36 points against the Lit-

. tle Mountaineers will also have

two Changes. Br-ad Bekampis
(6-1, 225), a Cherry Hill, New
Jersey recruit will replace Jerry
Leary at tackle, and Dave Gar-
119“ has earned a first team spot
at tailback.

“Garnett has been playing
great in the practices,” boasts
Rosenberg. “He’s had a couple
of real good runs.”

Garnett, whoruns the hundred

in 3.5 could help improve the . S it

running game that was some-
what ragged in the opener. With
Garnett sweeping to the out-
side, fullback Tony Esposito

should have more room up the ‘ '
middle. Esposito gained 46 ‘yards ,

in 10 carries, and scored two
touchdowns before being ejected
for fighting in the second quar-
ter of the opener.

The air attack will be controll-
ed by the passing combination of
quarterback Don Pl-usquellic and
split end Bill Pilconis. Plusque1-
he will also have tight end Bob
Jouret (6-5, 205) as 'a target.

Jouret has won the starting as--. *-

signment over John Wiley, dur-
ing the practices.

“Jouret and Wiley have both i

been Playing Wel1,” explained
Rosenberg,
Journet will start.”

Overall, the game will be a
stronf test for both the offense
and the defense. Despite the in-
Juries, the Cubs are confident
of passing.

“The chances of winning look
good,” said Rosenberg.

 
  

“but as of _now’

Though there are only two more dual meets 1'8-
maining for Coach Jim Banner’s cross country
squads, they should be the toughest of the season.
This afternoon, the varsity and freshmen host the
harriers of West Virginia at Schenley Park.

Both squads hope to keep intact their winning
streaks. The varsity (5-1) look for their fifth vic-
tim‘ of a winning which began after their lone
loss at Kent State. The undefeated freshmen (5-0)
need this one to maintain a “P€1'feCt" Streak Of
shutting out oponents from their first five positions.

To keep their winning ways, both squads must
defeat good West Virginia teams. The Mountaineer
varsity comes into this meet with a 1-3 record. But
their poor record is deceiving because they have
already passed through the toughest part of their
season. According to Mountaineer coach Stan Ro-
manoski,

“The Toughest part of the ‘schedule is over.
We should do better from now on.” West Virginia
has lost to Navy, Kent State, and Penn State.

Leading the West Virginia distancemen are
junior Carl Hatfield and sophomore Danny Payne-
Hatfield is one of the finest runners in the tri-state
area, and has captured firsts against N-'=1VY and
Penn State. Payne, as a freshmen, bmke many of
Hatfie1d’s fresh records.

     

While the soccer rivalry between West Vii»
ginia and Pitt may not be as heated as the foot-
ball series between the two schools, Leo Bemis’
varsity booters better be ready for a rough time
tomorrow afternoon when they meet the Mountain-
eer soccermen at Morgantown. -

The booters are still seeking their first victory
of the season after being humbled by Grove City,
3-0, Tuesday. The best the team has managed so far
are 1-1 ties against Ohio U. and Slippery Rock. In
their four losses the booters failed to score.

West_Virginia pro-vides anything but an easy
chance to turn the season around. The Mountain-
eers are 4-1 on the season and in their last outing
against Davis and Elkins they romped, 6-0.

The Mountaineers are a high scoring outfit,
paced by Walt Nistorenho, who has scored 10 goals
already this season. The junior college -All-Ameri-
can from Keystone Junior College has set his
sights on the WVU single-season mark of 17 goals.

West Virginia's most vulnerable spot appears
to be at fullback. The most valuable player from
last season, Jack Shannon, is sidelined indefinitely
with a leg injury. His fill-in, Joe Topley, is also
doubtful withia knee injury. Sophomore Rich Spo-
lar will probably get the call.

Still, victories in the mountains are hard to
come by.

A hurricane starts as a soft breeze, then comes roar-
ing in, spreading havoc in its route. Its namesake, Miami,

has followed much the same path.
The highly touted Hurricanes, picked num-ber one in the coun-
try by two national magazines, began their season with a pair of
-shocking upset 1osses—to Northwestern and Penn State. But, they

lived up to his press clippings,
averaging almost ﬁve yards a
carry.

Another Pennsylvanian, John
Acuff, -is the right half. Acuff,
who “hits with the force of a
50 megaton bomb,” -according to
one Florida newsman, is the
leading rusher with a 5.1 aver-
age. Fullback Doug McGee is a
three year starter.

Spl-it end Jimmy Cox “could

be -the best offensive end in the
land,” according to coach Charlie
Tate. Cox heads a ﬁne group of
pass receivers; a group so good
that Jerry Daanan, a two year
regular, is now a reserve._

Thus far, the Hurricanes big
problem on oifense has been at
quarterback. Last year’s regular,
Bill Miller, was unimpressive in
the ﬁrst two games. Soph Dav-
id ‘Teal fared little better, and
the assignment has fallen to Ar-
nold, Pa.’s David Olivo.

Olivo started thﬁsyear at full-
back, but has returned to quar-
terback where he played last
year as a soph. He is a strong
runner, and according to Tate,
a good passer. “Dave’s passing
helped us against LS-U,” Tate
asserted. _

Olivo throws only when ne-
cessary however. After the ﬁrst
two losses, the Hurricanes have
stayed mainly on the ground.
According to assistant coach
Bill Lewis, who scouted them,
they will run more counter plays "

\

and options than any other team
the Panthers play.

“The greatest athlete in the
University of Miami’s 42 years
of existence” is defensive end
Ted Hendricks. An All-Ameri-
can last year as a sophomore,
he heads a veteran defensive
unit. Last year, they finished
seventh in the nation in defense,
and seven starters return.

If the Panthers are to gain
yardage, it wil most likely be
through the air. Miami has
proved vulnerable to rollout
passers. “We seem to hesitate,
not knowing if to come up,”
said Miami assistant coach Ottis
Mooney.

The Hurricanes are strong;
there can the no doubting that.
They do -rank -as one of the top
teams «in the country. But, they
can be beaten. According to the
encyclopedia, a ‘hurricane is
strongest near the ocean. When.
it gets to the hills -or mountains,
it loses power and dies. And
this is a hilly town.

Linebackers weighing only 189 pounds generally retire
after high school football or else they try placekicking. But
Paul Killian wasn’t a high school linebacker, and at 189

pounds, he didn't figure at play linebacker for the Panthers either.
Not until last Saturday at Wisconsin anyway. But middle linebacker

Ed Gallin hurt his back, and some of the other linebackers didn’t

feel too well either, so defensive
halfback Killian found himseli
on the hotspot. At least he came
prepared.

“Before the game,” recalled
Paul, “Coach Bill Ne.al took me
aside and wi-th a blackboard
showed me basically what to do
on a pass and on a run in case
anything happened.

“I thought it was just an ex-
tra precaution.”

Killian wasn’t entirely with-
out experience though. The pre
vious week Paul had seen some
action against West Virginia at
linebacker on a goal line stand.
Although it’s not his regulai
position, Paul -saw some of the
good points about playing line-

- backer.

“I felt a -lot safer there,” he
remark-ed. “At linebacker I’m

 right there against the run to

hit them before -they get started.
At defensive halfback, they ‘get
'9 ten yard headstart and they
hit harder. Pass coverage is also
easier.

“I wouldn’t like to play there
steadily, though,” he added. ‘‘I’m
not strong enough. But if some-
body goes down Saturday, I’ll
probably go in.”

At any rate, Paul must have
been doing something right
against the Badgers, ’b'e‘CaLlzS-'8 in

Rosenstein the intrepid‘ lead-
er.

Crossbones for most tackles
made. He admitted that most of
his tackles came before switch-
ing to linebacker, but that in it-
self is unusual.

“Because we were in a man-
to-man coverage, I was up closer
to the line,’’ Paul explained. “I
was able to give more support
against the running game.”

This week the secondary must
cope with a talented receiver,
Jim Cox, possibly one of the
two best colllege receivers in
the country. Killian was respect-
ful, but not awed.

“He’s a great one,” Paul com-
mented. “Last year he hurt us
more than any other receiver.
He’s ‘big and fast. He maight be
the best prospect in the coun-
try.”

“But we won’t do anything
different aga-inst him,” he add-
ed. “We’ve been pretty success-
-ful with what we’ve used all
year. Nobody’~s hurt us with the
pass and there's no use in chang
ing it.”

In fact, the play of the defen-
sive backﬁeld has been one of
the team's brightest spots all
year. With Killian, Mickey Depp
and Joe Curtin returning from
last year’s squad, sophomore
Dave Dibbley was the only pre-

season question mark. Killian
squelched any doubts in Dibbley.

“I don’t think we've had ‘any’
problem adjusting to him,” he
reported. “Dave’s done a heck
of a job for a soph. I think now
we’ve got a lot more conﬁdence
in hll1’l’1 than before.”

Of co-urse, Paul can remember
when he was a sophomore, when
he didn’t get the chance that
D=ibbley’s getting now. In those
days Killian was an offensive
halfback, but it didn’t matter
because he didn't play.

Last year he was switched to
defense after one 16 yard gain
(“The best rushing average in
college football last year.”)
against UCLA. Sometimes, he

still longs for limited offensive
action.

“I like the fact that on de-
fense you -hit people, you don’t
get hit,” said Killian.\“B»ut I'd
like to play offense. I like to
run the ball.”

But for Killian, offense is in
the past. Defense is his -concern,
particularly against Miami to-
morrow. He knows he’ll  start-
ing at defensive halfback, but
that's about all he knows.

“I asked coach Neal jokingly
if I’ll -be playing linebacker,” re-
lated Killian, “and he said, ‘Rath-
er than work with you at it.
about 2:30 Saturday afternoon,
we’ll have a little imp_romp~tu

Win First, 3-1

Frosh Defeat Rockets

by CHUCK DWORAK

The rain and the mud could not stop the determined
frosh booters and Carlos Anselmo as they splashed their

way to a 3-1 victory over Slippery Rock Wednesday at the Rockets

Field. Anselmo, a left-wing, playing his ﬁrst full game, kicked two’

goals in the fros-h’s ﬁrst win of the season against two losses.

“It rained the whole game,”
commented coach Jim Snyder.
“I tried to get my goalie to kick
long at the beginning of the
game because of the muddy
ﬁeld, but the long kick hadn’1
been working too well for us
and we kept the ball on the
ground with surprisiingly good
results.”

Slippery Rock scored ﬁrst in
the opening quarter on a throw
in from the sidelines. Anselmo,
then tied the score on a pass to
the left side from Hugh Black
two minutes ‘before halftime. An
selmo broke the tie in the fourth
quarter when he booted one
through in a’ scramble in front
of the goal. Right wing Randy
Dry then added an insurance
marker from ten yards out on
the left side.

Snyder was impressed ' with
the team’s effort. “I could not
pick out one outstanding player
in this game,” he said. “They

were all out to Win this one. The
boys knew they could beat Slip-
pery Rock, and they got to
gether and proved it.

“The boys knew each other’s
moves much better now,” he
continued. “We h.ave been do-
ing mo-re scnimmaging in prac
tice, and we’ve spent more time
passing the ball around rather
th-an drilling on fundamentals.”

Snyder cited the work of goalie
Dick Pasternak. “I would have
to call him the most improved
player on the -team,” he corn-
men-ted. “He blocks the ball bet-
ter now, and he can call the
plays.”

Snyder stayed with a 4-3-3 de-
fense throughout the game. “The
wet ﬁeld slowed down their us-
ually fast game,” he said, “and
the zone defense didn't leave
them any open spots.”

The coach had no comments
about the team’s upcoming
schedule.

Take heart. Take a dime.
Then take a bottle of Sprite
from the nearest pop

Suddenly it's in

Biting. Tart and

cackle fiendishly

should; they're
probably chilled to

You tear off to’a

APH BY LEWIS NINE

  

 

She called it her “burning”
poem. And it was. It helped
ignite a ﬂame of opposition to
child labor throughout America.

“My quatrain was literally
true," Sarah N. Cleghorn said.
“The mill I wrote about actually
stood in the midst of a golf
course.”

Today the American people
owe a debt to people like Sarah
N. Cleghorn and Lewis Him, the
photographer. Without her, one

writer said, “the history of the
United States would have been a
difierent thing.” Hine’s
photography, showing children
working when they should have
been in school, “was more
responsible,” the National Child
Labor Committee said, “than all
other eliorts in bringing the need
to public attention.”

We, the 450,000 members of
the International Ladies’
Garment Workers’ Union, are
proud of Sarah N. Cleghorn and
Lewis Hine. We are also proud
of our union which has taken a
leading part in the campaign to
outlaw child labor and to
improve wages and working
conditions.

Our signature is the union
label, sewn into women’s and
children’s clothing. It is a symbol
of progress made; and more
progress to come.

Post Storm Warning 

(Miami Giant Awakens From Sleep;

Hart Says With Storybook Hero

By GEORGE LIES
Associae Sports Editor

Times haven’t changed
for the Panthers despite
Bob Bazylak and the story-
book victory last week.

Tomorrow, they tangle with
troublesome Miami of Florida;
a preseason choice for the na-
tional championship and a team

anxious to prove just that. Sta-
dium game time is 1:30 pm.

Miami shocked its followers
by losing to Northwestern and
Penn State, but after winning
their last two games, Miami is
now playing the type of football
people expected. —

. .“They were a. sleeping giant,”
began Bell Lewis, the defensive
backfield coach who scouted the
Hurricanes against Tulane and
Louisiana State.

“They have great personnel,
and they have finally found
themselves,” said Lewis, prob-
ably wondering why every team
encounter the Panthers.

Dave Hart, who- gained his
second win in 14 games when
Bazylak left 47,000 Wisconsin
fans with their mouths open,
wants to throw the ball against
the Canes.

Bazylak starts tomorrow, and
he'll call most of the plays on
the field. At Champaign, “Bazy-
lak did so well,” said "Hart, “that
it would’ve been silly to bother
him.” .

In the last two games, how-
ever Miami defensive backs

' have intercepted six passes, al-

lowing _only seven completions.

“They haven't been hurt con-

'GARY CRAMER found a home at fullback last

week. Though he's only 5-10, 1192 pounds, he aver-
‘ ages.3.6 yards a, carry, and Dave art calls him “a
gutty blocker.”

 

 
 

BOB BAZYLAK
Starts at Quarterback

sistently with the pass,” Lewis
added, “actually, no one really
hurts them defensively.”

We’ll do things other teams
haven’t done though,” he said.

Hart stays with the winged-T
formation, but he will split the
wingback (to the sp-lit end side,
not to the tight side as) he’s done
in previous games.

Against the Badgers, Hart
tried to. open the defense by
passing on first down. “I didn’t
care where We were on the
field, we were throwing the
football,” Hart said, recalling the
game.

Splitting two men to the same
side, Hart hopes, should spread
M‘iami’s defense. It should open
up for Panther runners.

But running has been Hart’s
headache, he’s tried five players
in the backfield.

Tomorrow, tw o sophomores

 

 

TED HENDRICKS
Na.t7.'on’s Best

start (their second straight
game. George Pribish, with an
average of 2.3 yards a carry,
starts at tailback; ‘Gary Cra-
mser, with a 3.6 average, goes
at fullback.

Mike Raklewicz, running with
the second team, may be the
blocker Bazylak needs in the
backfield, however, if Har t
wants to throw the ball.

Miami has given up 182’ yards
a game on the ground; the
Panthers 218.

“Tomorrow,” coach Howard
Weyers said, “we’re going to
rvu n right at Ted Hendricks
(Miami’s 6-7 All- American can-
didate).”

“He's tough outside, but we’re
going to go inside him,” said
the line coach.

But Hendricks is like a giant
within a giant. And he doesn't
abide by storylbook endings.

VINCE OPALSKY, one of many Pennsylvania boys,
on the Miami team, has carried the Canes at tail-
back with a 3.7 average. ‘From Mclieesport, he is
1 only a sophomore. " '
