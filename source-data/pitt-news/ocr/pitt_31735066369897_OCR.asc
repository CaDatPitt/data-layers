 The Waiting Was

iyi-in

  

By WES COTTER

The final space in WPGH.’s long
quest for FM status was taken Tues-
day when a construction license was
received from the Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC).

This license grants WPGH full
FM status and the right to braodcast
as soon as an antenna and transmit-
ter are installed-.

The call letters for the station will
have to be changed due to the con-
ﬂict with WPGH television.

The new station will be located at
98.5 FM but it will be a while b f

  

it starts broadcasting there. Accord-
ing to Larry Lunsford, Pitt’s’, media
adviser, the station must be com-
pleted within one year, and it may
take that long.

Lunsford said funding for the
switch to FM was set aside 5 years
ago by the chancellor.

‘‘I think that most of the money
has been set aside forthis. Butif the
money is not sufficient, the media
board will help with more,” Luns-
ford said. He went on to say that
after all the hard Work the board has
gone through, more moneyifor com-
plet_ion_ould be found if necess_a

Some of the delays in getting the
station on the air will result from
procedures that have to be followed,
including buying an antenna and

transmitter. This entails selecting a

company from competitive bids,
which takes a month, Lunsford said,
six months for the order and deliv-
ery of the equipment and addit_ional
time for installation.

Lundsford estimated the time
before Pitt hits the air waves at
between 6 and 12 months.

“We're quite estatic," Lunsford
said. ‘‘It took a lot of convincing,
work, peopl and money.”

good weather and abutments that alter a closer look did not need replacement.

Chancellor Establishes

  Teacher’s Award  

   ,natl1f¢-LN9.mi.“?t'i9F1$;5il9“1§ be. e I‘ I

By TIM HUNTER

The chancellor’s distinguished
teaching award is a $1,000 cash
prize given to a faculty member;
an additional $1,000 is given to
his department or school to be
used to assist the awardee in
teaching development activities.
The awards program is designed
to serve as a highly visible sym-

bol that the university has
serious commitments to
teaching.

Only full-time faculty
members are eligible; they must
be assistant professors or above,
‘with a minimum of 3 years col-
lege teaching experience, not
necessarily all at Pitt.

“We are presently accepting
nominations. They must be in
letter form with a maximum of
two pages. The letters should
include reasons why this faculty
member is an outstanding
teacher," said Robert L. Wolke,
director, Office of Faculty
Development.

The letters should also include
the person’s or organization’s
association with the ‘teacher,
address, phone number and sig-

   

  

sent to Room 360 C.L. The nom-
inations will be accepted from
any of six sources: an ad hoc
group of five or more students, a
student group recognized by stu-
dent government, an adviser, an
alumnus, a chairman or dean or
a faculty member. No self-
nominations will be accepted.
The deadline for all nominations
is Nov. 1, I983. ,

After all of the nominations
have been submitted and the eli- ‘
gibility of the nominee has been
confirmed, 10 students who have
been in the nominee's classes
within the past five years will be
asked, in a standardized manner,
for their opinion about the qual-
ity of the nominee’s teaching.
There will also be evaluations
solicited from the nominee’s
peers and chairman or dean. All
of this material will be submitted
to the Office‘ of Faculty Develop-
ment for final judging. The
board of judges will consist of
three appointees of the provost,
the presidents of the alumni asso-
ciation or his delegate and the
chairman of. the, Academic.

The awards program was pro-
posed jointly with the Faculty
Teaching Development Grants
Program for the support of
teaching improvement projects.
The funding for the two pro-
grams will come from a $250,000
endowment that is set aside from
unrestricted funds of the $50 mil-
lion Capital Campaign. Initially,
most of the money will go to the
awards program.

Along with the $2,000 of cash
prizes, the winners will receive a
certificate signed by the chancel-
lor and the provost, an inscrip-
tion of the awardee’s name on a —
publicly displayed plaque and an
inclusion among the distin-
guished -members of the univer-
si-ty community.

There'will be a maximum of
eight awards given annually. The
cumulative group of awardees,
to be known as the Didactikos
Society, will meet with the chan-
cellor, theprovost and the direc-
tor of the Office of Faculty
Development to discuss the state
of teaching at the university. The
awardees will be announced in
March at- the annual Honors

Torn Walsh, program director for
the new station, said, “We are one of
the best equipped college radio sta-
tions. We have about the same
things as a big station like WDVE.”

Walsh said, “If we had the equip-
ment, we could broadcast on_FM
right now." Walsh went on to
explain that the antenna for the new
station will be put on top of the
Cathedral of Learning and should
be able to reach everywhere in the

county. He also said the new station '
iseexcited about the number of peo-.

ple it will be able to reach. Walsh
estimated its potential at between

listeners. .
The ‘music that the station will
play will be the same as it is no,w,\a
blend of “new music” including ever-
ything from top 40 and new wave to

hard and soft rock. Groups such as 

Quiet Riot and REO Speedwagon

one and a half and two million 

are just a few examples, Walsh said."

WPGH began its drive for FM. ‘

status back in the fall of 1977. A
conflict arose between Pitt's station

and those of Carnegie-Mellon Uni- 

versity and Bethany College in

Few Takers

By DIANE LEFKOWITZV

An ad in this Wednesday’s Pitt
News read: “Help Save the Intern-
ship Office,” requesting that stu-
dents attend a 3 p.m. meeting of the
Student Government Board (SGB).
It didn’t seem to have much effect on
the student body.

At three o’clock, various members
of the board were coming in one or

two at a time, but there were not

students, no irate protesters angry
over the closing of the full-time
Internship Office.

“I wouldn’t exactly call it a case of
student apathy,” said board member
Mindy Goldberg. “The studentsjust
didn’t have time to find out about
[the meeting].”

The meeting was part of a cam-
paign by the _SGB to get the students
-involved in re-opening the Intern

, G ship Office on a full-time basis. It is

now functioning three days a week
out ofthe provost’s office.-
Petitions have" been circulating
around campus for about a. week,
and Goldberg said there are already
700 to 800 signatures collected, with

Man vs. Machine .

By MIKE BUCSKO

Technological advancements and
the infiltration of computers in all
phases of society will not alter the
quality of life for most of us, accord-
ing to a Carnegie-Mellon University
professor.

Dr. Allen Newell, U. A. and Helen ‘

Whitaker University professor of
computer science at CMU,
addressed the role of artificial intelli-
gence on society before a crowded
auditorium in the Frick Fine Arts
building yesterday in a lecture
entitled, “Artificial Intelligence and
the Quality of Life.”

The lecture, sponsored by the Pitt
Forum for Social Responsibility
and Values, focused on what future
effect computers will have on our
daily lives.

Newell said he thought comparing V

artificial intelligence and the quality

 

a long-term goal of 5,000. A 

letter-writing campaign is also to be
initiated by the SGB soon. '

In other’business, the ‘board"'.?;'}}
unanimously approved a recom-_.‘i‘=‘:

mendation by the Allocations Com-

mittee to give $500 to the French 
Club to help cover part of the.-ff
expenses for a trip to New York City_  -;

to see a Monet exhibit at the Metro-
politan Museum of Art.

. Last year, the Allocations Com- _ 
mittee would not back a request by ’ V

the Italian Club to go to New York

also to see an exhibit at the Metro-— ‘
politan Museum of Art, but com- 
mittee chairman Steve Smith said 

the difference liesin the fact that the 9
Italian Club wanted to send just two

representatives to see the exhibit and ' »e
report back to the club, while 25 2 
members of the French Club will be’. .

other factors that affect the quality
of life.

“It seems more practical to com-, 
pare the government and the quality -- 

of life,” he said.

For this reason,’ Newell substi- 
tuted technology for artiﬁcial intelli-‘S F 
gence in his lecture and pointed out .51;

the complexity of understanding
artificial intelligence. -
Artificial intelligence is getting

computers to perform duties that 

can be done by human learning and
‘perception, in other words, pro-

gramming computers .to carry out
intelligent acts, according to Newell. 7. 

“Because of the prevalence .of ._
“one _,,;‘

technology,” Newell said, A
‘would believe we are on the thresh-

old ‘of drastic changes through artiﬁ-.  

cial intelligence.” _

Was Dry Rush Successful?

By JOHN HOUSTON,,,,,,.__
And MELINDA SMITH

This term is the first time that Pitt
fraternities have had a dry open
rush; meaning no alcholicpgbeverages
were allowed to be sef\?é’d"during the
two-week period.

Now that open rush is over, some

questions have been raised as to the '

success of dry rush. In addition to
that, some may be wondering if the
system can be improved upon. .
Denis Donham, of the student
affairs office, said nobody at the uni-
versity told the fraternities “to shape
up or ship out.” There was an on-
going discussion between the two,
and the topic of a dry rush evolved.
In the spring of this year, the Inter-'
fraternity Council (IFC) formed an
ad hoc committee to review the.
question of a dry rush policy. After
much study, it came up with a set of
guide lines, not only pertaining to
the restriction of alcohol, but res-
tricting rush in other areas. .
The rules that the IFC came up

. with are:

*The first 10 days of rush are to be
dry. '
*The word “party” cannot be used
to advertise because it carries a bad
connotation with it. ,

*Only registered rushees and girls
are invited to rush activities.

*All fraternities must follow the
university poster policy. g

*Fraternities cannot use the

intelligence into society would
bring, from adapting a mechanism
for its use to fitting it into the physi-
cal world.

He reinforced his conclusion by
saying that, although economic fac-
tors increased during the 1960s, the

Carnegie-Mellon University"

that money did not affect the quality

in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that
showed that life expectancy, mar-
riage rates and birth rates are rising
but noted that these indicators are

either.

Newell called his view of the argu-
ment a “sober analysis,” outlining
two “radical options” that may take
place in the future.

First, artificial intelligence, like
the theories of relativity and evolu-
tion, will bring about some changes
and may revolutionize some aspects
of live.

But, Newell said, with all the
scientific discoveries taking place
today, science belongs to the “revo-
lution of the month club.”

Secondly, Newell outlined what '

he referred to as a “rational web," a
process in which a database ‘would
be programmed with arguments to
questions. This method would be
“immoral” because it would substi-
tute computer judgment for human
judgment, he said.

Newell concluded the lecture by
reiterating the position with which
he began.

“Artificial intelligence won’t
charige the quality. of,1if,e. f.or.,m0st of

words alcohol or sex in their ads
because they take away from the
positive aspects of the fraternity
system.

‘Any Greek function can be
advertised, but private functions
cannot be.

Greg Wilson, IFC president, said
he felt the dry rush was a big advan-
tage because there were less com-

‘‘I feel that we could
have gotten more
pledges without a
dry rush.”

plaints from neighbors, less garbage
(beer cans, cups etc.), more money
was saved by many fraternities
because alcohol was not purchased
and there were less distractions for
rushees and brothers, giving them a
better chance to get to know one
another. _
Dave Stein,_ a pledge at Pi
Lambda Phi fraternity, said dry rush
gives a person a chance to see what
‘fraternities are really Tike without
being intoxicated. . _
“I’d like to see the fraternities have
one day of dry rushfor an open
house, like the sororitie_s have, so

that the rushees could get an over-
view of all the frats,” said Greg Bro-
jus of Pi Kappa Alpha. “I feel
though, that we could have gotten
more pledges without a dry rush."

Wilson said there could I be
improvements in the system, but he
would not like to see the university
get involved. He said that with a
little money and professionals from
other universities, the Greek system
could be improved.

Greek adviser, Bridget Guernsey, ‘

said dry rush is not happeningjust at
Pitt, but is occurring all across the
country. She said university involve-

ment would be helpful, and once the .

fraternities saw that the university
help was beneficial, they would want
the help.

“The lnterfraternity Council
informally monitored the dry rush
and found that the rules seemed to
be followed," she said.

'Guernsey said she feels that her
role is to help educate the fraternities
and said the role of the administra-
tion is to teach them, not to restrict
them.

Guernsey finally said the way to
improve not only rush, but the
whole system was to get good pub-
licity for the fraternites and to give
them a good public image.

Jeff Mallinger, rush chairman for
Pi Lambda Phi, said he wouldn’t
like to see the university get involved
at all.

Man Of Peace

The winner of the annual Nobel Peace Prize was
announced Wednesday, and the Norwegian Nobel
Committee could not have selected a better person to
be the recipient of the prestigious award.

Lech Walesa, founder of the now-outlawed Solidar-
ity labor union, has been an inspiration_ to the free
world since the union’s inception in 1980.

Without regard to his personal safety, Walesa con-
tinued to fight for Polish workers even after martial
law was imposed in December 1981 and Solidarity was
banned.

The committee said Walesa’s work was “character-
ized by a determination to solve his country’s prob-
lems through negotiation and cooperation without
resorting to violence.”

' l . Walesa was one man who had the courage to face up
to a country that he thought was restricting the free-
dom of his people. His primary goal is simple, basic
and human: freedom of his people and his country
from the oppressive communist regime.

His urge for freedom and human rights without
resorting to violence is characteristic to two great free-
dom fighters of this century: Martin Luther King,
.Ir.,and Mahatma Gandhi.

Americans of all nationalities and races should now
be praising the Nobel Prize commitee for its choice of
Walesa. Walesa is only the second person within the
communist bloc to receive the Nobel Peace‘ Prize.
Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was the first.

We can only hope that Wednesday's announcement
is not too late for the people of Poland.

The government’s attempt to discredit Walesa
through the use of propaganda will be heightened
during the next few weeks because of the award. It is

_ clear by the onslaught of the propaganda that the
communist regime of Poland is afraid of Walesa and
his followers.

Hopefully, the Nobel Peace Prize announcement
will spark new hope in the hearts and minds of the
Polish people, and they will not abandon their fight for
peace and freedom for their country. .

And, ﬁnally, we can only hope that Walesa’s win-
ning will send a message to the Polish and Soviet
governments. It is time now for the leaders of free
countries that support Walesa’s ideals to exert more
pressure on the communist bloc that is trying to
squash him.

With the constant struggle in Lebanon, the unrest in
Central America and the rest of the fighting going on
around the world, Walesa and the constant struggle of
the Polish people for freedom without violence is truly
an inspiration to peace and democracy.

Journalism is a unique profession.
It has to be one of the most contro-

Even with the bad journalism, how-

which compares with the free press
that exists in the United States. The

and even the abuses of the right must

The Horace Greeleys and Ernie

the advances journalism has made in
the course of its history. Most peo-

the small, independent newpapers

After‘ two decades in journalism, I i

desk. It was a strange experience. I '

government and report fairly and
accurately, hopefully, the news.
College and university newspa-
pers have the same rights of a free
press as I given the professional
media. There are exceptions, how-
ever, in private institutions. Some-
times, college and university
newspapers are given even more
protection by the courts in that they
are not considered the “profession-

als" that comprise the public media, .
and their mistakes are excused more .

lightly than those made by the pro-
fessional media.

This added protection for college
and university media is a beneﬁt. It
is true that college journalists are not
professionals by the mere definition
of the term; yet, that is a poor reason
to excuse shoddy reporting. The
same amount of fairness and accu-

. racy should be expected of college

journalists for the mere fact that the
obligation is there, and the public
expects nothing less.

Easier said than done! The staff
turnover factor in college journalism
inhibits the assurance of profes-
sional journalism. Those institu-
tions with journalism programs
have full-time faculty and staff
working with the newspapers, often
in laboratory situations. That
insures some amount of consistency
with the newspaper from year to
year. At institutions without a jour-
nalism department, the newspapers
often operate with a dependency on
staff training of peers. Again, the
graduation and turnover of staff is
high, and the opportunity to develop
consistency of a professional nature
is not as easily achieved.

The Pitt News once existed in a
fashion similiar to that detailed in
the last paragraph. Thanks to coop-
eration from the English department
and a few dedicated faculty
members, we have developed a rela-

fiPitt’s Media Mimics, Real World  

tionship that is as strong as those
existing at institutions with depart-
ments of . journalism. Many new
journalism classes are being taught
here, the annual Writer’s Confer-
ence is a benefit, and the new Emer-
,ging Writer’s Program also assists in
"creating an atmosphere of profes-
sionalism not only at The Pitt News
but with other student ‘media on
campus. , i

The cooperative efforts between
the student media and academia
have been a lon.g time in coming.
Sometimes, , faculty see extra-
curricular activities as unnecessary
extras that hinder the classroom
learning experience. Luckily, we
have interfaced academics with the
extracurricular and have created
learning experiences outside the
classroom that often prove as bene-
ficial as those in the classroom.

We may never reach the total con-
sistency and professionalism that we
desire with our student media at
Pitt, but we have made great strides
in recent years. We can expect per-
fection but, at the same time, be
pleased with quality that is beyond
expectation. We can expect and
demand professionalism in student
media. It is the real world.

There are so many people to
thank for so many things. You
already know who you are. I think
about that interview with the cub
reporter from my hometown news-
paper. It is much easier to ask the
questions than to answer them. It’s a
crazy business. It really is.

(Editoris note: Today is Dr. Luns-
ford’s last day as adviser to Pitt's
media groups. The staff of The Pitt
News would like to take this time to
thank Dr. Lumford for his help,
guidance and support during the

time he has been at Pitt. We wish ’

him continued success in his career
and in his future endeavors.)

Dear Editor:

  
  

David A. Sopko’s letter,
“Reader Recites Track Record,
(Oct. 5, 1983), asks us to “exam-
ine the record" of The Pitt News,
and particularly, of the opinion
page.

I have examined that record,
and while Mr. Sopko has offered
some valid insights into at least
four segments of the record, I
suggest that his failure to
acknowledge and account for all
of the facts seriously weakened
the usefulness of his comments in
evaluating the quality of the
opinion page.

It is quite true that articles

raised the hackles of various
groups, resulting in a ﬂood of
letters from irate readers. From
this, Mr. Sopko concludes that
“no one really cares what The
Pitt News prints unless it is
insulting to some campus organi-
zation." Sounds like a valid con-
clusion, right?

On the other hand, is nothing
to be said for the many letters
received and published by this
paper taking reasoned positions
for or against editorials and
columns expounding opinions
on serious issues? Shall we ignore
the attempt of The Pitt News

through these columnstoiniti Le ,,

of quality in education, student
health and financial security,
employment or world peace?
Will the many fine responses and
challenges to these pieces from
Pitt students, faculty, adminis-
tration and staff simply be
forgotten?

Perhaps there is more “sense-
less drivel” than honest opinion
and debate on the opinion page.
But this is not Mr. ‘Sopko’s argu-
rnent, for he clearly suggests that
it is. all senseless drivel. I suggest
that this is manifestly untrue.

Students’BodIes Focus
of Health Education

By MIKE SIBERINI

One of the most important aspects
of the Student Health Service at Pitt
is its Health Education Program,
although it may not be fully realized
by the student body.

“I guess I would just like for the
students to be impressed with us,”
said Robert LaCivita, head of the

program. “There’s a lot going on

right here for the students to utilize.”
The following is a capsulized view
of some of the programs offered:
Weight control: One of the more
popular programs, weight control
generally attracts 60-80 students
each semester,’ most of them
females. « '
LaCivita believes that the reason
the program attracts such a large
number of students is that they are
worried about their inner and outer
selves.
“People are concerned about the
way they .look and the way they
feel,” he said. “If they don’t look

good, then they don’t "feel good 4

either.”

, The program runs once a week for
l0 weeks during the Fall and Winter
terms. This will be the first term,
however, that there are separate
classes for males and females.

Irene Dunny, a nurse at the Stu-
dent Health Service and the person
responsible for the weight control
program for the past four years, said
that this class offers more than just
trimming down.

“We just don’t stress losing
weight. We also teach healthy living
and nutrition. At the end of the pro-
gram you leave with a good, nutri-
tious diet.”

Stress management: This pro-
gram runs in five half-hour sessions
and can be set up on an individual
basis.

_Each of the sessions will be taken
up by separate topics. The first and
last weeks will consist of a self-
analysis to determine what your sta-

data to fall back on, she notes that
patients in past stress management
sessions have experienced an 80 per-
cent reduction in symptoms (head-
aches and backaches, to name a
couple). .

C.P.R. and First-aid certiﬁcation:
More than 750 students received
first-aid certification through this
program last year, approximately 40
percent were undergraduate stu-
dents‘ from the School of Health
Related Professions. .

The two major thrusts of the clas
are the actual skill of performing
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and

the_implantation of better living
habits to help prevent an attack.
Alcohol Awareness: in the past,
the participants in this program
came on a voluntary basis. This

year, that will change as any person '

caught drinking in campus residence
halls against the new university alco-
hol policy will be sent to the pro-
gram. This doesnot mean that those
who seek help independentlywill be
turned away.

The program consists of three
classroom sessions with Gerald Col-
vin, who heads the meetings as a
doctoral student at Pitt and one with
a psychologist from the Student
Health Service for evaluation. _

Miscellaneous: Included in the
remainder of the programs are two
classes to be taken for credit. Health
Science Education is offered in con-
junction with the department of
health and physical education and
will deal with current health prob-
lems like drug abuse, sexuality and
stress. This course will be offered in
the Winter Term. The second class,
Current Problems 16: Human Sexu-
ality, is taught in the Fall and Winter
terms.

Utner programs include a Health ~-

Self-Assessment, Blood Pressure

Screening and Health Lifestyles of

Pitt Program Council Lecture Committee letter to the Editor:

Alex Haley’s scheduled appearance here at Pitt next Tuesday (October
11) in the William Pitt Union Multi-Purpose Room at 8:00 pm should in
every way uphold the educational, cultural and social interests of the
student body which the Pitt Program Council was founded upon.

a Although it is true thatthe Pitt Program Council Lecture Committee is
one of the many campus organizations that missed an excellent educational
opportunity in not providing a forum for Presidential candidate Gary Hart
due to time limitations,’it must certainly be acknowledged that the members A
of the lecture committee have the educational interests of Pitt students at
“h(e)art” with the program selections of -Alex Haley, Ambassador‘Arkady
Shevchenko, and Dr. Cyril Wecht’s presentation of the J .F.K.» assasination.

Haley’s writing has won him America’s two topmost writing awards: The

Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Colleges and universities < 5

have awarded him 17 honorary academic doctorate degrees and Mr. Haley
has receivedbvfer 300 special recognitions. Time magazine has labeled
Haley “A Folk Hero,” and his book Roots “A Cultural Landmark.”

Dr. Cyril Wecht’s scheduled presentation on November 17th of the
“John F. Kennedy Assassination” is hoped to incite as much interest as the
Arkady Shevchenko sell-out lecture did.

Limitations

By JOHN GAMBESCIA

The mock‘ courtroom in Pitt's
Law Building was full yesterday,
not for a trial, but to hear a lec-
ture entitled “Earl Warren and
the Limits of Judicial Interpreta-
tion” by Professor G. Edward
White of the University of Virgi-
nia Law School.

White, a noted lawyer and his-
torian, has just recently pub-

lished a book entitled Earl K

Warren: A Public Life.

“The problem with constitu-
tional interpretation is that our
- Constitution is a specific text,

cial review is wide open for.broad
interpretation.

White sees the limits of inter-
pretation of our Constitution as
centered in three main areas:
constitutional limitation, politi-
cal limitation and professional
limitation.

He also said that he feels Chief
Justice Earl Warren, in the case
of Bolling v. Sharp, violated all
of these limitations. '

The Sharp case dealt with the
constitutionality of racial segre-
gation in the District of
Columbia. I

the

5th Amendment's due process
clause, when in actuality, they do

‘ not coincide with each other

under the issues of the case.’

“Warren’s interpretation of
these amendments as stemming
from ‘fairness’ does not appear
anywhere in the text of the Con-
stitution,” White said, “thus, he
just made it up."

White said that the framers of
our Constitution used specific
language which gave the docu-
ment a specific meaning, both
now and then. The meaning of
the Constitution, however, may
change as our values change,

Studio Theatre Gets in Gear

By STAN WOZNIAK

If you’ve never seen the basement
that surrounds the Studio Theatre,
you may be missing quite a show.

The entertainment provided by
the Studio Theatre ‘and its players is
much more diverse than one might
believe it to be. Last year's offerings
ranged from a razzle-dazzle imita-
tion of many Broadway shows (“On
Broadway”) to a dark comedy
involving a crippled child (“Joe
Egg”) to a children’s show (“You
And‘ Me”). i

What some people don’t seem to
realize is that admission for the plays
is free for students with valid ID and
that Studio Theatre isn't just‘ live
theatre but variety" entertain'r—ne_n_t
planned by students, organized by’
students and acted by students. Seen
by students? Not always. And why

SGB fMeets

continued from page one

The subject of remunerating
Greek Week Over-all Chairpeoplev
was once again brought before the
board, but a quorum of five votes
either way could not be reached.

In favor of remunerating the
chairpeople were Kathy Brown, Jeff
Delmontagne and’ Barry Greene.

‘Opposed to it were Mindy Gold-

berg, Ken Stram and Craig Mur-
phey. Dan Lecceabstained from
voting.

“The issue here is whether or not

,the Greek Week Committee can dis-

tinguish itself from other organiza-
tions,” Brown said. “I think Greek
Week merits a different status. How
do we justify paying the presidents
of governance groups and not pay-
ing the chairmen of Greek Week?
“It’s not our place to judge

1 whether the ‘chairpeople-dothe same

or more work than the chairmen of
our former governance groups,"
board member Craig Murphey said.
“There are other people in this. uni-
versity who do a whole lot of work
and don’t get paid for it.”

Greek Week is a standing commit-
tee of the Interfraternity Council
and the Panhellenic Council, both
the presidents of which get
renumerated.

‘‘I don’t see why we have to separ-
ately recognize them monetarily
when the Greek system is already
recognized,” Goldberg said.

“If we can look at what Greek
Week does not just for the Greeks
but for the whole community, I can
justify remunerating the chairpeople
of Greek Week,” SGB member
Barry Greene said.

The issue was tabled again until
next week.

Because» of the success of the

not? After all, going to the movies
anymore is not all that economical.

Within the studio theatre, you
find a group of students whose tal-
ents are unquestionable and whose
goals and aspirations are admirable.
They are not just friends or acquain-
tances — their relationships are
close-knit and intimate.

“You become a family and you
really care about the people,” actress
Wendy Held said. “It’s a wonderful
feeling.”

The Studio Theatre not only func-
tions as an entertainment outlet but
also as a bridge for many of the stu-
dio actors to become involved in
other theatre organizations such as
the New City Theatre and University
of Pittsburgh . Mainstage. Actors
become educated behind the scenes
with props and lighting and in front

of the scenes with stage direction
and movement.

‘You might think it’s a well-
balanced diet for those individuals
who dream of becoming superstars,
but that’s a gross misconception.
True, there are dreams of “making it
big” (not unlike the main character
in “Flashdance”), but the Studio
Theatre serves to provide an educa-
tion, and the actors involved are
there to perfect their talent, to do
what they can do best without any .
hint of actually being the best.

“It takes discipline more than any-
thing,” Held said, “as well as a lot of
time and energy.” _

Actors rehearse, on the average,
three or four hours a_ night through-
out most of the week, for what boils"
down~to an hour or two of entertain-
merit. When the final applause drifts

off, it's back to the drawing board‘
for the actors who are faced with yet

* another audition. Only a memory is

left of things soon to be forgotten.

This term, the Studio Theatre _,

brings us “The.Woods,”,a play by
David Mamet, that will run through
Oct. 13-15. Woody Allen‘s “Death
Knocks” headlines next, . with
“Line," a play by Israel Horovitz, to
run from November 3-6, 10-12.
“Lovers” by Brian Friel will run
November 18-20, 30 and December
3, and the One-Act Festival will
wind down the Studio Theatre sea-
son from December 8-1 1.

So the next time you have a free
evening, you might check out one of
the plays and find that the journey
into the Cathedral basement may be
for you like walking into the mirror
from “Alice In Wonderland."

three would have had to reduce its

Then the National Assciation of
Broadcasters successfully convinced
the FCC to freeze all of Pitt’s

in Johnstown sought to join the
Pittsburgh market on a cable chan- 1
nel, posing another conflict with
WPGH’s frequency.

The station sat and waited, for
two years, while legal attemts were

Hellman's Classic Play

By JONATHAN KUNKEL

The Playhouse Theater Center has
two reasons to be proud of itself: its
elegant, renovated lobby and its cur-
rent production of The Little Foxes by
Lillian Hellman. -

After a gla_nce at the sharp decor in
the lobby, one would expect nothing
less than a first-class production. A
first-class production is indeed what
The Little Foxes ends up to be.

, On opening night, the cast’s con-
centration was down, and they
seemed quite nervous during most of
the first act. By the second act,
though, they were relaxed and gave a
very impressive performance.

Set in the Old South during the rise
of the industrial fortunes, The Little
Foxes focuses on the greed and manip-
ulation of a basically unhappy family.
At the center of this greed and
manipulation is Regina Giddens, a
firm and independent woman, deter-
mined to get her own way.

Regina, insistent on getting the
money her brothers need for an
investment, has her sickly husband
travel back home, just so she can con-
vince him to loan her brothers the
money. She also forces her brothers
to give her a bigger share of the
investment return.

Her husband, Horace, refuses to
put up the money necessary to make
the investment. What results is a ser-

  Meets With Success

ies of conflicts and confrontations
that make for an exciting evening of
theater. _

Lillian Hellman, of course, is truly a
talented playwright. Her study of the
Hubbard family makes one think
about family life and how unhappy
some families really are. Her charac-
terization of Regina is definitely
innovative. She has a basically evil
woman seem somewhat justified in
her actions.

Nancy Chesney does a fantastic job
of portraying , Regina. Her every
move took the stage by storm, a qual-
ity needed to correctly portray Reg-
ina. Someof the strongest.moments
in the play ' were confrontations
involving Regina. The Playhouse
should definitely hold onto this~tal-
ented actress. .

One of the most disappointing per-
formances of the evening was given
by Jill Wadsworth, who portrayed
Birdie. Her first scene was the worst

' in the show. She spoke too fast and at_

one point, seemed to slip from a bad
southern accent to a Cockney accent.
As the play progressed, she improved
somewhat, making her big scene in
the third act a bit melodramatic, but
still a little touching.

James Prescott, who portrayed
Horace, was too energetic and force-
fuliwhen he first arrived on stage. He
then became extremely sickly, which
was what he should have been from

the beginning.

Don Wadsworth’s direction was
subtle and direct. He used the smaller
Hamlet Street Theater stage to his

advantage, making the movements.

natural and effective.

Mary Burt's set complemented the
production nicely. The opening—night

crowd greeted her impressive‘ set
with an enthusiastic ovation. The set
also had a lived-in look that is very

difficult to create on the. stage, but_

Burt did a fine job with it.

After seeing The Little Foxes, one can
very easily see that the Playhouse is
definitely on therrise again as a major
center in Pittsburgh Theater.

'Gin Game’ Marred Byi1\/Iissing Cards

By 'MARK HOLAN

If show performances were hands
of gin, then Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre found itself down a few
points after last Friday's opening
night presentation of The Gin Game.

Afterall, the two players couldn't
have missed several pages of the
script and expected to come out com-
plete winners.

» That's exactly what happened to
Bingo O’Malley and Nann Mogg. But
the remainder of D.L. Coburn’s 1977

Pulitzer Prize winning script that’

they did perform provided a generally
satisfying evening of theater.

Give credit to Bonnie Baky’s inti-
mately detailed set — brought to
immediate focus in the three-quarter
round Lab. The stage recalls the feel-
ing of September Song thanks also to
lighting highlights by David Strang.

Lab artistic director Bill Royston is
the unseen dealer directing O’Malley
and Mogg. Opening night, he was
unsuccessful in bringing these two
ace players to the top of the deck. By

tonight, however, one week into the
‘run, the shuffle and performances
should be completely limber.

The Gin Game concerns Weller Mar-
tin and Fonsia Dorsey: two senior
citizens trying to cope with living in a
home run by welfare. Neither
receives any visitors, and neither,
particularly Weller, wants to spend
any time inside the home watching
television and second-rate magicians
or singing songs. So they play gin on a
seedy old porch outside.

You have to think about the des-

peration of people looking for friend-
ship in such places. Otherwise, it can
be difficult to understand exactly
why Weller clings to Fonsia and why
she bothers to be around him. Here

I

again, O’Malley, Mogg and Royston‘ i

come up short of the necessary pro-
jection of ensemble last Friday.

If the problems mentioned have
not been corrected by tonight, it will
be a shame indeed. We're betting that
the Lab will be able to boast ”gin."

The Gin Game runs through Nov. 6.

Pitt Studio Theatre Opens In 'The Woods’

By LINDA HENRY

The University of Pittsburgh Stu-
dio Theatre opens its 1983-84 season
this weekend with The Woods by David
Mamet. As with all studio produc-
tions, the cast and staff consistsof
students, including second year MFA
directing candidate Jim Robinson.
The play runs Thursday through
Sunday, curtain at 8 p.pm. with final
~perfm-mans; on October 15th. Stu-
dio shows are free- to Pitt
undergraduates. "

Robinson chose the play initially
because he thinks it's a ”great play,”
and he knew it would work in the
arena set up of this year's studio
design. One of the major features of
the theatre is the ability to change its
seating arrangement, ‘which is
rotated yearly between thrust, arena
and proscenium,offering a greater
challenge to the students using the
space. .

_MFA directing students are
encouraged to produce a'full'-length

. play in their second year, so Robinson

decided to do The Woods out of a high
regard for playwright Mamet and
because of the play’s simplicity in util-
izing only two actors. This offers the
special challenge of keeping the
audience interest for 90 minutes
straight.

"A lot of people have problems
[with the play], thinking it preten-
tious, only having read it,” states
Robinson. ”Mamet attempted more
than the ordinary in both conceptual-
ization and presentation. The play
depends on language and its use of
dialogue full of poetic, yet very real,
images to convey what is and isn't
going on between people. The Woods
deals humanely and tenderly with
human emotions.”

Following The Woods in the Studio
Theatre will be two one-act plays
running together: Death Knocks by
Woody Allen, directed by George
Cherico, and Line, by Israel Horowitz,
which offers another challenge for

director Kenyon Barr, since he must '

create four pictures with a play
whose main conceptual image is a
straight line. The shows will run
from Nov. 3 through 12.

Following will be another MFA
directed show, Lovers , by Brian Friel
with Rick Ewing directing. Lovers will
run from Nov. 19 through Dec. 3.
This show will be followed by the Fall
One-Act Festival from Dec. 8
through 11, the showcase production
for Pitt directing students.

The Studio Theatre offers any Pitt
undergraduate student the oppor-
tunity to participate in theater from
the audition process through final
production. In its 13th year, the
theater is budgeted to do seven
shows, ranging from classics to mod-
ern theater, including one children's
show. Other groups, such as the Pitt
Dance Ensemble, use the space to
showcase their work, and workshops

' dealing with all aspects oftheater can

be offered_for the Pitt student body.
It is an ideal place for student play-
wrights ‘to get togetherwith student

actors to work on their material.
The goal of the Studio Theatre is to
allow students to plan and run their
own theater. It is funded through
Student Government, and each show
is proposed to the general member-
ship (open to all Pitt students, not just
theater majors). After approval from
the members, the show is given
rehearsal and performance time

slots. Open auditions are held to cast ’

the show, and technical staffs are rec-
ruited. Each production has a faculty
adviser, but the shows are totally
student-produced, offering the per-
fect opportunity for practicing class-
room knowledge. V

This year's Studio Board members
are: Donna F. Saul, president; Chris
Gauthier, vice-president; Burton
White, business manasger; Lisa Gut-
tadora, publicity manager; and Jim

Robinson, graduate liason. The Stu- ‘

dio Theatre is located in the newly-
remodeled basement of the
Cathedral of Learning. For more
information, call 624-6587. '

  

Showcase, Friday, October 7, 1983.

 

  

  

The form and tone that director
and co-writer Lawrence Kasdan

‘ comes up with in The Big Chill is com-

parablegto, but incomparably better

than, John Sayles’s The Return of the

Seacaucus Seven. A rural setting; a reun-

ion of '60s friends; a weekend to

reminisce about fond memories, cry
over lost illusions and loom over the
crisis of middle age.

The Big Chill has a brilliant opening
— an "opening which is one of the
 most refreshing in recent years. To
.  the tune of ”I Heard It Through The
 ,Grapevine,” we glimpse the eight
I characters as they each receive a piece
of bad news. The ninth character, a
man being dressed in a smart suit,
‘turns out to be a corpse. Hewas Alex,
and it seems Alex has slashed his
"wrists. This unexpected suicide
prompts his former college‘ class-
mates to reunite for the funeral and
_ an V unplanned weekend of self-

7 observation and examination.

. Our hosts for the weekend are
lHarold (Kevin Kline of Sophie's Choice)
and Sarah (Glenn Close of The World
/iclcording’ to Garp). Harold has become
a ”groovy” capitalist who operates a

‘ profitable running-shoe company.
Sarah is a doctor and the one most
upset over her ex-lover Alex's
suicide.

Meg (Mary Kay Place) is a lawyer
 who no longer has a desire to con-

 
  

 

 

: Instead, she wants a baby and hopes
the reunion will produce a father, but
 " not a husband. Her first mistake is to
‘if p zero in on Nick (William Hurt of Body
‘ —' Heat), for he has been’ impotent since
, the Vietnam War. Nick has become
' _ the most cynical and is the lost soul of
the group who supports himself
"pushing drugs. , '
W5} _‘ Former college reporter Michael
 _—' (Jeff Goldblum), who used to record
i;;7 P ‘ protest triumphs now interviews idi-
‘ ' . ots for People magazine. Karen (Jo
M Beth Williams) was also a writer but
,  sacrificed her career for a stifling
[. marriage to an advertising executive

" H.‘ named Richard. Therefore, Karen
cherishes the renewed interest of
Sam (Tom Berenger), who has trans-
formed "Mr. Radical” into ”J.T.
' I Lancer," the hit character in a televi-
sion series. Sam lamely protests that
he puts at least something of value in
 every show. Finally, there is Chloe

“ (Meg Tilly), who is Alex’s_ex-bimbo.
Chloe is quite an air-head who is the
same age now as all the others were
when they first met.

Rarely do we find a Hollywood film
which offers us so many full—bodied
characters that are intelligently writ-
ten and stunningly acted. It is not
_ surprising, then, to find out that Kas-

“ dan has had a phenomenal career. He
has written the screenplays for Return
. of the Jedi, The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders
3 ‘__ of the Lost Ark and Body Heat. In contrast

I to these ' pop genres, The Big Chill
seems to be based on Kasdan’s per-
sonal experience. It is an involving
film‘ which quickly and skillfully
‘grabs and throws you into the story.

Beyond the Limit is a tired film: tired in
characterization, tired in plot and
tired in entertainment value. The
reason it's tired is that sitting
through it is like sitting through a bad
version of Casablanca in South Amer-
-ica, only that it's been updated so that
Richard Gere can do nude love scenes
(he is Hollywood's only bankable star
who will do them).

‘ Based on Graham Greene's novel,
The Honorary Consul, and nicely
directed by John Mackenzie (The Long
Good Friday), the story involves Dr.
Eduardo Plarr (Richard Gere, sport-
ing an English accent), a half-British,
half-Paraguayan living in Argentina
near the Paraguayan border who is
searching for his father, a Para-
guayan political prisoner. Plarr
doesn't really care about anything
else, which makes this another
unfeeling, hard-assed role for Gere.
Plarr meets up with Charley Fort-
num, the useless and alcoholic British
honora'ry“con‘su‘l‘ (played ‘very’ ‘con-"

.\.

hopes of finding his father. This in

 

vincingly by Michael Caine, who has

— and deserves — top-billing,.despite
Gere’s bigger role). The two develop

-a give-and-take friendship. The plot

thickens when Plarr finds Charley

’ married to a prostitute named Clara

(Elpidia Carrillo), with whom Plarr
happens to be obsessed. Sound
familiar? ‘-

Plarr and Clara continue to have a
long and torrid affair (including some
really lousy sex scenes) that everyone
in town. knows about except poor
Charley. Colonel Perez (Bob Hos-
kins) is the dictatorial police chief (a
clone of Casablanca's Louie) who is also
in the know, and he does everything
possible to let his friend Plarr know it.

In his spare time, Plarr gets
involved in a guerrilla plot to kidnap
the U.S. ambassador by his boyhood
friend Leon (Joaquim de Almeida), an
ex—priest-turned-guerrilla-leader in

another Casablanca ghost: the apoliti-
cal Lost—Generation-type getting
involved in some outrageous political
subversion. I

The major problem with Beyond the
Limit is a lack of empathy for the char-
acters. No one really cares what
happens to them. At one point, Plarr
tells Leon, ”I’m a simple man,” to
which Leon replies, ”There’s no such
thing.” But Leon is wrong: Plarr is
simple — too simple — in his motiva-
tions, actions and feelings.‘

The aura of Casablanca is too omni-
present: the idea of the Lost Genera-
tion, the Hemingway hero loved by
allpbut returning no feelings. Unfor-
tunately for Beyond the Limit, Eduardo
Plarr is not Rick Blaine, and Richard
Gere is definitely not Humphrey
Bogart. ‘ '

Wait till this one comes to David
Lawrence.

177‘ Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence is
based on the Laurens van der Post
novel about life in a Japanese
prisoner-of—war camp on Java in
1942. Directed in Japanese and Eng-
lish by Nagisa Oshima (In The Realm
Of Senses, Diary Of The ‘Shinjako Thief)
this bizzare cross-culture film star-
ring David Bowie is definitely one of
the most unique films of the season.
Bowie portrays a ”soldier’s sold-
ier," who encounters a warrior
9.-fmolded in the traditional samurai
manner. When the fanatical warrior,
Captain Yonoi (‘Ryuichi Sakamoto),

 

meets Bowie’s character, one can
instantly sense the homoerotic
undercurrents that flow between
them. In addition to this relation-
ship, one can also perceive a none-
too-convincing relationship between
the Brit who understands the Japa-
nese sergeant (Takeshi).

As the film develops, it shows us
just how different two cultures can
be. The British, for their part, can't
understand the fierce Japanese con-
victions about their customs and
gods, while the Japanese can't under-
stand how the British can live with
the disgrace of captivity. This is illus-

trated in graphically violent scenes of

hari-kari (killing oneself for purposes
of honor) throughout the film.
Although some of Oshima’s film is
hard to swallow, it still provides us
with some interesting ideas, offered
by a gifted film-maker. The acting in
the film is fair; it seems that everyone
ferociously overacts, except for

David Bowie in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.

    

Natalie Wood

Bowie who creates a startling, self-
possessed character. Merry Christmas,
Mr. Lawrence is somewhat predictable
and slightly unprofound at times, but
nonetheless, an enjoyably fascinating

oddball.

After Natalie Wood's death in

1981, the ”mind boggling” film, Brain-
storm was to be scrapped. But through
director Douglas Trumball’s (Special
effects genius of‘ 200 1, A Space Odyssey,
Close Encounters of the Third Kind and
director of Silent Runner) determina-
tion, the film was able to be

‘completed.

Brainstorm examines mind transfer-
ence with a scientific breakthrough
by scientists Christopher Walken
(Michael) and Louise Fletcher (Lil-
lian). By putting on the ”hat," one
could experience the thoughts,

'actions, tastes, emotions, physical

and mental pain which another had
experienced and recorded on the
shiny tape disks. As with nearly all
inventions nowadays, the hat's initial

 

purposes are abused ‘when the

'use it for spying and other military
defense purposes. On the other hand,
though, the hat is able to mend

riage after Walken records a tape of_ '

his heartwarming memories of their
relationship and transfers these
memories into Wood's subconscious
(through the hat). Others in the film

I'M NOT ME
Zoo
RCA I

When some people want to
start a project, they buy a box of
toothpicks and build a sailboat.
Mick Fleetwood organizes
bands. And, especially for some-
body who talks a lot about ”band
energy,” he's done it at about
the same level of excitement.

Fleetwood here is quoted as
being the ”lightning rod” of the
band, pulling this assortment of
talent together. What's unusual
is that Fleetwood neither sings,
writes norteven gets in a drum
solo -— he leaves most of this to
the other band members.

This turns out to be one of the
only unusual aspects of the

release. Half-way through, you

begin to feel _this same album
would have fit into the musical
scenario of eight years ago. Or
five. Or two. It reflects no time
period at all, actually. The vocals
are similarly indiscriminant,
never really pointing in any one
emotional direction.

You can tell that these guys
aren't’ new to playing instru-
ments — Fleetwood's hand-
picked unity is there. But you

"can tell they're awfully new at

writing songs. Even. the titles
bear witness to the trite lack of
originality: ’’Tonight,’’ ’’I Give,”
"Just Because.” Simple, cliched
and unexciting. A further

example (from ”This Love”):

”This love is the first thing] This
love is never thirstingl This love
forevermore...IOh, I need you]
Yes, indeed, I do." '

At this point one can see

songs. But you can't blame
Fleetwood for either of those —
remember he doesn't sing, and
he doesn't write. In.fact, for one
song, he simply sits out and

creative lightning.

With some bands, you need a

little time for them to grow on

CORRESPONDENCE
Peter Godwin
Polydor

Peter Godwin’s new album,
Correspondence, is a wonderful col-
lection of short, dance-rock
songs that explore modern rela-
tionships with fresh lyrics and a
variety of melodic styles.

Correspondence is produced by_

George Kajanus and engineered
by Raphael Preston (who also
engineered Vangelis' Chariots of
Fire), both of whom also play
keyboards on the album. Pres-
ton is a definite plus for this
release since it relies so heavily
on synthesizers‘ and guitars
(and computer’ drums). The
acoustic sound he gives the syn-
thesized melodies keeps them
from sounding like. anything
from outer space. '

Godwin’s voice is another
very positive’ factor as it blends

the lyrics so well with the melo- l

dies. Carol Kenyon (from
Heaven 17's "Temptation") also
adds dimension‘ with her back-
ground vocals on the title song
and especially on ”The Art of
Love," where she is reminiscent
of ' the female vocal on Pink
Floyd's ”The Great Gig in the

‘ Sky" from Dark Side.

The album is full of love

‘songs, ”but not the typical kind

of rejection-acceptance songs,”

as Godwin explained in the bio-
sheet. Instead, he is ”more con-

 

cerned with the subtler nuances
ofrelationships,” such as. com-
mentary on today's dating game
(the reggae ”Window Shop-
ping”), lovers parted with the
hope of being reunited (”Baby’s

\ in the Mountains”), sexual inti-

macy (”Soul to Soul,” ”Young
Pleasure” and "’The Art of
Love”) and intimate communi-
cation between lovers (”Corres-
pondence,” ”The Dancer” and
the slow, torchy "Soul of
Love”).

Correspondence is an album of
excellent all-round creativity,

/and I anxiously look forward to

Godwin’s next efforts.

Life Gets Better And So Does Graham Parker

GRAHAM PARKER
October 4, 1983
Stanley Showcase

By SCOTT MERVIS

After six years of songwriting
wracked with bitterness and frustra-
tion, it is quite evident and well-
known that life has gotten better for
Graham Parker. Much of his earlier
material was left on the shelf Tues-
day night, in favor of the new Real
Macaw songs which mark a change in

  
   

demeanor for Parker. 1 he new songs,
loving, polished and even mushy,
were performed with such freshness
that it sounded as if he were creating
the words and singing them on the
stage for the first time.

Parker's voice, a cross between
Bruce Springteen’s and Elvis Costel-
lo's, is still one of the finest instru-
ments in the business, and it was in
top form. Whether he caressed the
love song "Anniversary” or belted
out a bluesy rocker like ”White
Honey," he never lost the grasp of his

distinctive style.

Parker's exuberance and lyrical
direction showed that his heart
securely belongs to the woman in his
life, and his choice of songs reflected
that. Out of the short 18—song set,
eight were taken from The Real Macaw
and nothing was played from the
excellent '81 and '82 releases, Up Escal-
ator and Another Grey Area. It is not the
first time that a performer has dis-
carded his past material for songs
that are presently more personal and
relevant to his life (Bob’Dylan and
Peter Gabriel come to mind). In his
earlier work, there were not many
songs free of an outright or underly-
ing negativism. Even if a I song
sounded positive, a closer look would
often reveal an inkling of doubt,

irony or apprehension. Lust and des-

perate need abounded over love.
Now, Parker does not even have
his tongue in his cheek when he
sings, A train crash, someone gets murdered,
there's a threat of war.../ You tell me that you

The Waitresses

The Waitresses

_ September 29, 1983
Heaven

By RICHARD sum

It's a whole different restaurant: --
a considerably streamlined version of
the Waitresses is on tour, and appar-
ently, most of the original band has
been jettisoned. At any rate, they're

' down to five members after an event-

ful summer — Patty Donahue’s outl
Holly Beth Vincent's in/Holly's outl
Patty's in] Chris Butler's out — and all
the press coverage that went with it.
The Waitresses’ status would seem
uncertain, but they really are on tour,
and they took to the stage at Heaven
last Thursday night. V
Good news: at least two of the
house specialties remain on the menu
— Lead vocalist Patty Donahue and
ex-lead guitarist/founding father

Chris Butler's incisive songs. Last_

Thursday's crowd was appreciative
as the new ensemble served a vigor-

ous 70-minute set, kicking off with "I

love me, I tell you that Ilove you, and ldon't
have to be worried anymore. One album
ago, he sang, ”I never expect any
satisfaction!"

Although the Macaw songs were
happily welcomed, the sweat did not
start to pour until mid—way when he
reached back for the raging ”Soul On
Ice," and there was no turning back
once the packed Stanley Showcase
crowd rose for "Protection," ”Local
Girls” and ”Saturday Night Is Dead,”
from the electrifying Squeezing Out
Sparks album. The subdued Macaw
band, featuring the three-guitar
power of Parker, Brinsley Schwarz
and Hugh McCracken, broke loose
and remained on the edge for the
more driving and danceable songs,
"The New York Shuffle," The Jack-
son Five’s ”I Want You Back" and the
rowdy ”Last Couple On The Dance
Floor.’’

In "Protection," Parker sings,‘ ”I
must get out at any price before the
feeling gets too nice,” and unfortu-

Remodeling, But Open For

Could Rule the World if I Could Only
Get the Parts." Donahue made the
song her own; her petulant Everygirl
persona was intact, cigarette in one

V hand and beer bottle within easy

reach of the other. She held attention
magnetically, starkly turned out in a
black mini-skirt, and stockings and a
short white blouse. >

She played the part to perfection,
never dropping the defensive, railing
distractedly at boys and sex and a
girl's role in society, twisting her hair,
dancing all over the stage. ”What’s a
girl to do? Scream and screw? No!"

"she pouted during "Wasn’t Tomor-

row Wonderful.” A string of Waitress
favorites followed — "Luxury," ”No
Guilt," ”Bread and Butter,” ”Think-
ing About Sex Again,” ”Make the
Weather" — a good smattering from
their three albums. The new band
proved tight and able to cope; a
strong bass, guitar and drum built a
good framework for Donahue’s
vocals and some excellent, soaring]

nately that's what he did. He charged
the crowd, but said goodnight before
the. climax. There was no ”Soul
Shoes," ”Heat Treatment,” "Stick to
Me" or ”Endless Night." The list of
neglected Parker classics was too
great.

But, though the set may have
ended abruptly, one could not have
left without Graham Parker's good
vibes keeping him warm for the rainy
journey home. Parker has reached a
new plateau in his prolific career, and
with a new-found source of happi-
ness and his first hit, ”Life Gets Bet-
ter," he appears on his way to a wider
creative potential and a promise of
success.

The Crackers, a local band, were a
perfect warm-up act, featuring a
well-played, basic rock-n—roll, Rock-
pile style. They have three strong
vocalists, two excellent lead guita-
rists, good taste in covers and a few
catchy originals, and they have a lot
of fun putting it all together.

Business

squalling sax work.

”I Know What'Boys Like” provided
the highlight; at the kicker in the mid-
dle -— "How would you like it? You
can trust me..."~—-— activity stopped;
audience yelled; anticipation built;
Patty Donahue at last crooned
"sucker!” Wild cheering and applause.
"Bruiseology”ended the set — "they
hit me with the hard factsland then
everything cracks and that's the brui-
seology." For dessert, an encore.
After the unseasonal but delicious
”Christmas Wrapping” and a rousing
rendition of ”Heat Night,” Donahue
and company left the stage with the
crowd yelling for more — the best
time to quit_.

Although Donahue’s trademark
whine suffered at the expense of

Heaven's overblown sound system, .

her performance — and the band's ——
was energetic and likeable. Their
future may be uncertain, but at pres-
ent, The Waitresses still provide
fresh and entertaining fare.

Out or Anonymity

By MARK A. SINDLER

“We knew going into the season_
that this would be one of the biggest
games of the season and I don’t
think ' anything’s changed,” Florida
State football coach Bobby Bowden
said prior to last week’s 27-24 drub-

r'f.*,=:bing by Auburn.

For ‘both Pitt and the Seminoles,
scheduled to match. shoulder pads
tomorrow, at 1:35 p.m. amidst
50,000-plus in Pitt Stadium, a lot
has changed since both teams kicked
off their respective seasons Sept. 3.

FSU'comes to town with a 2-2
record after also losing to Tulane
two weeks ago 34-28. On the other
side of the line of scrimmage is a Pitt
team similarly shackled by a two-
game losing spell after Maryland

. and West Virginia feasted on an

unproductive offense. _

The Panthers are still searching
for a lethal running attack. Pitt’s top
rushers are both fullbacks, Marlon
Mclntyre ( l_87_ yards) and Marc Bai-
ley (153). Though both backs’ aver-
ages‘ deem.respectability at a little
under five for both, the tailback spot
seems ‘to have likened to -vacancy

Changes could be in the works
tomorrow when freshman Chuck

Scales -gets -his first start: -there, 

though the regular, Joe McCall, is
fully healed from a pulled calfinjury
and is expected to get some
handoffs.

“Whatever we have to do offen-
sively,” Pitt head coach F oge Fazio
said, “we have to move the ball.
That's the best way, getting it to skill.

Stennett and [Dwight] Collins.”

drives.

There is no better time to begin
than tomorrow. Already FSU has
amassed 139 points, or ,34.8 ‘per
game. Perhaps Pitt can take conso-
lation knowing the Seminoles have
surrendered even more on defense.

“The offense started off real hot,
but has cooled off the last couple of
games,” Bowden said. “On defense it
seems ours can’t stop other teams. It
was up front in the first two and last
week it was the secondary. We’re

53 slacking up at times.” -

The Seminoles have seemed to
drop into a black hole. Their opposi-

tion has been forced to punt only

nine times. That’s nine timesin four
games. Bowden would do well to
bring in reserve National
Guardsmen.

FSU’s defense is led by 6-6, 260-
lb. tackle Alphonso Carreker, who
recorded 97 tackles and eight sacks
last season. Returning from the
noseguard spot he occupied last sea-

\ When the Pitt football team
lines-up tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
to face the Florida State Semi-
noles at Pitt Stadium, sopho-
more quarterback John
Congemi will be making his
fourth consecutive start since
John Cummings had his collar-
bone broken in the season
opener at Tennessee.

For many Panther enthusiasts
though, Congemi is still far from
a household name.

Where did he come from?
How did he go from being fifth-
string quarterback behind Dan
Marino, among others, last year
to first—string this year?

The Lauderdale Lakes, F1a.,
native was highly recruited as a

~ senior" at St. Thomas Aquinas

Tfitt, Congemi had narrowed his
choices to Alabama, Michigan
and Pitt. He chose the Oakland
campus because of the opportun-
ity to start as quarterback as a
sophomore.

“I figured I would at least have.
a shot at starting by the time I
was a sophomore," Congemi
said. “[In addition] playing
behind or getting to learn from a
guy‘ like Dan Marino was also a
great opportunity.” -

“Though I wasn’t in' there
playing, I was able to read a-
defense from the sideline and

High School. Before deciding on a

think of what to audible to.
Marino was able to read and
react to defenses so quickly and
confidently. Now that I know the
system, I can try to do the same."

He’s done just that. In his first
start against Temple, he called
eight audibles and was correct on?
seven. On the first drive of the
day, Pitt went with a no-huddle,
hurry-up offense. Congemi
would step up to the center, Jim
Sweeney, look over the.Temple ‘
defensive setup and calla play
that he hoped would work. He
was successful, until he over-
threw'Dwight Collins down the
right sideline, resulting in an
interception. .

When the decision was made
back on September 8 to go with
Congemi against Temple, a big
question mark loon'ied‘o_ver the
Panthers and whether they
could, for the second week, suc- ,
ceed with aquarterback who had
not played at the collegiate level.

Against Tennessee, John
Cummings made hisfirst start at
the ‘spot. and performed
admirably. T

It was _time to see if Congemi
could do likewise.‘ He did." The
Panthers punished the Owls 35-
0. Congemi performed with the
poise and character of a seasoned
veteran, it was as if every “play
was made to order. 2

Two weeks later at Maryland, '
however, Congemi, resulted in a
13-7 defeat.

tested this weekend when'Pitt travels
to Lafayette, Ind., to take part in —
or be taken apart in — the Purdue
Classic. ,

The action referred to will be gen-
erated by three nationally ranked
teams — Purdue (8), Nebraska (7)
and Kentucky (6) — teams whose
action makes James Bond's seem
boring. If Pitt can react fast enough,

-wits apparently impossible mission,

upsetting one of these teams,
becomes just nearly impossible.VIf
Pitt can match action for action; and
Newton’s law remains intact, East-
ern volleyball history will be made.
Towards the end of sharpening his
team's reactions, Pitt coach Shelton
Collier incorporated a new drill in
his practices this week. It is called,
appropriately enough, “the board.”
The board is set up on top of the net
and represents the hands of blockers
on the opposite side of the net.
“We know we’ll be playing against
teams with many players in the six-
foot range, which means they’ll be
able to block even our best spikers
regularly,” Collier said. “We’ll actu-
ally have to be ready to play defense

By MARK A. SINDLER

Last Sunday, folks from the
Texas Rangers and New York Yan-
kees played a baseball game in
Arlington, Texas. Most of them
were basically going through the
formalities.

You know, it’s the last game of the
season and 'the contest’s outcome
doesn't really matter much since
both teams were long ago eliminated
from any pennant race hopes.

Despite the hum-drum atmos-
phere, one player felt as if he actually
was in the midst of a decisive game-
the crucial effects ever on his mind.

Allen Lachowicz, a former Pitt
hurler under coach Bobby Lewis,
started his first game ever for the
Rangers since being plucked from
the first-round of the 1981 draft.

After spending the '82 season with
the team’s AA club in Tulsa, Okla.,
and moving to the AAA affiliation
in Oklahoma City, Lachowicz made
his minor-league work pay off,
allowing seven hits, walking two and

I striking out six over six innings.

Lachowicz struck out New York
outﬁelder Reggie Jackson twice, but
could not bring home the bacon for
the Texas faithful in the Rangers’ 2-0
loss.

For Lewis (who was ﬂown down
by Lachowicz), though, there was

‘enough of a performance by his

former standout to merit serious
considerations next season.

The Pitt News, Friday, October 7, 1983.

“After talking with [Texas man-
ager] Doug Rader,” Lewis said, “he
said he looked very poised and con-
fident out there and will probably be
with the team in the very near
future.” '

Great, but what did Lachowicz’
collegiate tutor think of his baptism
on the mound? _

“Allen will be a big winner,” Lewis
remarked. “He has all the tools, but

most importantly, the temperament ‘

necessary for a good pitcher. People
will always tend to make mistakes
and errors behind you. That can rat-
tle a pitcher.

“Allen has the stamina not to let
that hurt him. You can’t let error get
you down. You can’t get upset over
that.”

Lachowicz seems to have another
kind of discipline. Though hard to
pinpoint, it probably has something
to do with controlling jumpy
nerves—the kind that start shaking
before the first "pitch.

When Lachowicz called home and
made arrangements to get Lewis and
his family down to the Lone Star
state, he really meant the "full
arrangements.

Said Lewis, “I was nervous. I was
probably more nervous than he
[Lachowicz] was. He met us at the
airport around 12 noon and the
game was scheduled to begin at 2:05.

“I said to Allen, ‘What are you
doing here? The game starts in two

$

hours; you should be atthe stadium.
Then he told me not to worry about
it. Sure enough, he left right after
meeting us and went straight to the
stadium.”

Not even facing the famed Jack-
son seemed to bother Lachowicz,
Lewis said.

“I asked him what he was thinking
at the time,” he continued, “and
Allen said it'was just another batter.
He put himself in the position that
he was just pitching another AAA
game."

Before being called up by the
mother club on Sept. 6, Lachowicz
spent all of the ’83 season with Okla-
homa City, the team losing to Louis-
ville in playoff competition. Prior to
a leg injury which occurred in June
when Lachowicz took the brunt of a
line drive, he compiled a 4-1 record.

 

Leading the association with the
top earned-run average, the right-
handed hurler came back to post the
second-best ERA for the season.

Last season, while with Tulsa,
Lachowicz earned a World Series
ring.

Five years out of Cannevin High
School, the McKees Rocks native
has come far in his major league pur-
suits. That, however, does not even
surprise Lewis. He recognizes
potential—even in someone fresh
out of high school.

“Coming here,” Lewis recalled of
the '79 season, “he was a starter
immediately. I could see it. He has
an intense dedication to baseball,
belying his good start [against New
York]. '

“He has a good arm and a hard-
breaking curve. But he had to work
on his changeup, to keep batters off-
balance.”

Lachowicz led Pitt to its finest
season ever in 1981, when the Pan-

. thers rode a 25-8 record. After pitch-

ing eight _ games in I980 and
compiling a 3-2 record good enough
for a 5.05 ERA, he came back strong

_for the subsequent campaign.

His effort was good enough to be
tied on the all-time list with 13 career
victories and tied for third with
former major league standout Doc
Medich with 153 strikeouts.

Former Pi/tt Hurler Emerges As Texas Star..

Prior to the Rangers’ selecting
Lachowicz while he was still a jun-
ior, he had a shot at making the
transition right out of high school.
Instead, he opted to give engineering
a shot. And even after three years of
that, he came close to not being
drafted.

That was two years ago.
“He hesitated," Lewis remem-
bered. “He had a price and insisted

that anything below that could not «"5"

keep him from returning for his
senior year.

“During that week, he told them
no once. Then Texas called him
back Friday night and he headed for
the airport Sunday night. In
between, he took me out for dinner.”

Listening to Lewis, it was not a
payback by any means.

When asked how he aided in
Lachowicz’ development to the
major league stage, he replied, “I'd ,

like to see it as my not hurting him in" 

any way. I just tried not to overpitch
him then. I didn’t want to deter his
natural maturity development.”

Lachowicz will soon be headed
for Ponce, Puerto Rico, for winter
ball. He can only hope to receive the
kind of developmental tips received
during his three-year tenure under
Lewis.

turned in 145 tackles last year,
second on the squad. Next door is
junior Henry Taylor.

That is it for defensive notoriety.
Instead, FSU is better known for its
QB-backfield duo of Kelly Lowery
and Greg Allen. The 6-0, 200-lb. tail-
back has been questionable ever
since injuring a knee in the Tulane
fiasco. Bowden claims there is a“50-
50 chance" of him starting.

Pitt wide receiver coach Kent
Schoolfield, who learned the Semi-

L 3 noles ambush tactics while a similar

assistant from believes
otherwise.

“I’ve been averaging 10 calls a day
from friends in Tallahassee,” he
said. “They assure me he is going to
play.”

“Secretariat,” as the Southern
Seminoles say, owns 10 FSU records
and led the nation in scoring last
year with 21 TDs. This year Allen
has picked up 470 yards on 81 carries
and is fairly close to being a coach’s
dream. ‘

But Bowden was hard-pressed to

1976-81,

I e“detail his prize back’s finesse, which

had him leading the nation in scor-
ing before the Tulane game.

“Tell me about yours and I’ll tell
you about mine,” Bowden cracked.

The senior'Lowery (6-1, 225) is in
his second starting year, with a cur-
rent 61.3 passing percentage,
improved over 52.1 last year. Low-
ery is also squeezing close to 13

yards out of each completion, 84 of
which have netted 270 per game.

It all points to a wide-open offen-
sive attack.

“This is an excellent team,"
Schoolfield said. “Florida State has
probably one of the most explosive
offenses in the country.

“Lowery is kind of like having

[Pitt defensive end] Al Wengli- '

kowski at quarterback: in his junior
year we were going to make him a
defensive end. He’s the kind of guy
you want to have if you’re in a bar
fight.’ You’ll want Lowery on your

Collier has confidence in his play-

“We have several key players,
such as Pat Belcher, Cathy and Sue

play at the national level but do not

said. “They’re great athletes, and if
they rise to the occasion, we’ll be in a

Nothlng To Lose In Purdue Tourney

he’s counting on being the exception
rather than the rule.

“We have experienced players on
our team, and they are aware that
upsets happen every day," the
fourth-year coach said. “The best
team doesn’t always win, and we are
aware of that. We're going into this
tournament with the -intention of
making one of those upsets happen.

“If we win any one ofthe matches,
it will be the biggest win in the his-
tory of eastern volleyball.”

In the past couple of years, Pitt
has beaten numerous highly ranked
teams, including Tennessee, Texas,
Ohio State, New Mexico and Texas
A&M. Just this season, the Lady
Panthers knocked off Florida State,
which was ranked 20th at the time.
Easily the biggest upsets, however,
were over western powerhouses Ber-
keley and Pepperdine in I981; Col-
lier considers these two victories the
tops in eastern volleyball.

Collier attributes his successes to
hard work rather than administra-
tive policy.

“I think the primary difference is
that the other three teams play a
consistent national schedule, where
we simply don’t have the resources
to afford that level of competition,”
Collier said. “The philosophy of our
program has been to work as hard as
we can, and when we ‘have the
opportunity to knock off a national
power, we make the most of it."

Opportunity does not knock
much harder than this. In order for
Pitt to get its foot in the door, Collier
believes that his team will have to
serve for a lot of points.

“Despite the fact that the other
teams are better, we hope we can, by
our serving, be in a position to win,”
he said. “When you’re the underdog,
you have to have a way to score
points. We hope to be the strongest
serving team at the tournament.”

If Pitt loses, the reason could be
the pressure the players put on
themselves.

“If we put pressure on ourselves
because we’re playinghig-hly-ranked
teams, we may not play as well,”
Collier said. -

However, although pressure may
work against Pitt’s spikers, it can
also work for them. . .. -

“If we can put pressure on them,” a

Collier said, “then they would feel
pressure from getting beat by an
unranked ‘team, and that would
work for us.”

Whatever the outcome, Collier
believes his team will benefit from
the experience. '

“Win or lose,” he said, “we will be
a better’ team as a result of the
matches. We should be much better

Tale of Two Quarter-
acks..

This is the story of two quarter-
backs, both with riﬂe arms and glar-
ing statistics out of college. One is
making his first career start while the
other has been demoted.

John Elway, the No. 1 draft cho-
ice of the National Football League
draft last April and the Denver
Broncos $5 million investment, has
been benched for this Sunday’s

-game against the Houston Oilers.

Bronco coach Dan Reeves said he
made the move to improve Denver’s
defense, rated last in the NFL.

Basically for the same reason,
Miami head coach Don Shula
benched veteran David Woodley tr
play former Pitt quaterback Dan
Marino. Marino was impressive in
last week’s loss to New Orleans. The
