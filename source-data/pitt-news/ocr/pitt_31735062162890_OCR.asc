C. Northcote Parkinson,
, noted Britishrauthor, will lec-
ture on his most{—rec_ent best-
seller, “Parkinson’s Law,” at
Midday Series this ~Fri_day.

 York .Times as “Bugs Bunny with
"a Ph.-D.s, nonchalantly nibbling his
carrot,” Professor Parkinson com-

_ bines wisdom with_ humor in his

-- «satire, on._pol_i_ti_cal__ economics.
First _published as - an anony-
g Vmous article, “Parkinson’s Law”
set forth the ~the's_is that =“w_or‘k
expands so as to fill the time
available for its corhpletion.” "In
other words, governments and or-
ganizations build huge staffs, but
V 1 they”d'o‘ not necessarily accomplish
any more work than what was ac-
’ -complished with smaller -staffs.
, 7 His second law states that
t “expenditure ‘rises to _meet in-
~.come'.” By this is meant that
spending in afamily, a business,
, orga government automatically
- ‘mops up income as fast as it is
' " available.

. Supported by facts and ﬁgures
gathered" from examples in gov-
ernment and business, Par_kinson’s

berations among top executives.

and lower-echelon staff members
- on both sides of the Atlantic. And
. ‘ upon publication of -the book,
Parkinson was characterized as
“the Darwin of managerial evolu-
tion.” . ’
According to ‘Professor Park-
inson, the idea of the now-
famous “Law” came to him
while. serving as a major in the
British Army during World War
II. Inspired by this initial dis-
covery, Parkinson developed a
number of shattering principles

Long occupying a unique position in
the ﬁelds of electronics and electro- °

years — has moved more and more into
the development of complete systems.
This has lead to major staff expansion
at all levels, including a sizable num-

The Gyrodynawrzics Division \

Meaning For Camus

By David Breakstone
The other day someone remarked that there
certainly have been a lot of dire warnings and
critical articles in the papers recently on everything
from defense to skiing. .(In a melon-sized world

we begin to compete in almost all areas of human 3

endeavor.) - .

This fellow continued by observing__that prac-
tically no one was paying the
least bit of attention to these
various wolf—criers, and with
good reason, For, in his opin-
ion, no one was saying anything
new. This in no way detracted
from the validity of the criticism, -
but rendered it nonetheless im-
potent. V N’

The only -consolation, accord-
ing to this man, is that even-
tually through mere repetition

' and the law of averages, people

,will begin to listen as well as hear.
The Best of All Possible Conclusions A
This view while homespun, in the manner of a
Will Rogers, may be the most realistic of all pos-
sible conclusions to reach.‘ I am not sure at the
same time that it is an optimistic sign ofthe times.
But then college pundits have never interpreted
much of anything as being optimistic.
"er. There are, however, some examples close -to
home which may bear out a “let’s just keep shout-
ing until someone listens” approach. Each of them
illustrates that results occur after a lot of frus-
trating wall pounding by‘ sanguine heads. >

Something I Absurd . . .1 A
If It Is.  Worth

By Ina Amdur

“In the midst of winter, I discovered that there
was in me an invincible summer.” Albert Camus’
invincible summer, which ﬂourished for forty-six
years, was ﬁnally conquered on January 4 of this
year when he was killed in an automobile crash
in France. The Nobel Prize Win-
ner, who had fought death and
darkness most of his life,‘ and
who said .. ‘that immortality had
no meaning to him, ﬁnally died

' in a manner which only intensi-
ﬁes the validity of one phase, of ,
his philosophy. _ . if

Certainly Camus’ death at ‘the.

.age of forty—six can be called
“absurd.” For few men exem-
plify, the intellectual conscience
of the twentieth century more
than Camus did. His death, at an age when most
men are settling into__ middle—aged complacency,
had a profoundeffect on those who loved his writ-
ing and through his writing grew to love the man
himself. _

Camus recognized‘ that twentieth century lrnan
was in" a unique predicament. He had lived
through the Second World War and had seen suf-
fering and meaningless death. Camus also saw a

world without’God, without eternaluvalues, and '

with very few certainties, one of which was the
inevitable death of every human being. .
But instead of growing a beard, beating the
bongo drums, andindulging in ‘funwashed eccen-
trici_ty,” Camus fought all his life against ‘nihilism
and despair. He wished to live meaningfully with
what he knew’, and now that he is dead those who
survive him realize that to the extent than any

human being’sili1‘e can be meaningful, Camus‘ was. ‘

Symbolic Sickness - -
One of the most signiﬁcant books th_at Camus
_wrote can illustrate his unique service to the world
which he wished to reconstruct. In The Plague,
‘Camus describes a city in France which is stricken

with the black death. However, gradually -the-'

(reader begins to understand that_ the bubonic
plague is only a symbol for all of the evil and
suffering and pain which man must endure. '

The bubonic ‘plague is never really conquered
but always reappears 'and must be fought by a
humanity which realizes that only through love
and compassion can life be meaningful. Dr. Rieux,
the atheistic. doctor who might well. be Camus,

j ﬁghts the‘ plague while realizingmthat essentially

The late and fondly remembered Chaplain 
Emory Luccock attempted to single-handedly es- ’ ’

ethical conduct in daily affairs, the Chaplain lived .

lainfollowed his own drummer, and the Univer-

sity was warmer for it. He made his personal
philosophy of "hope the symbol of much of the
University. ' " .

Moving to the strictlylacademic, there is the-
case of curriculum revision. While everyone in the
University “family” has nominally agreed to in-
clude students’ opinion in'the proposed changes,
only one department -has pioneered in actually
inviting the studehts to help. Some departments 
haven’t even seriously thought about any substan- 1
tial changes, let alone, allowing the “enemy” to 
participate. 7 /~-4‘.-i,-_i‘ 3

Then, and inevitably, we get around to that old
.debbil cheating, and its own little population ex-
plosion. The last exam period graphically illus-
trated the proliferation of these “desperation”
tactics. . . «-

According to the New York Times,‘we have
been conducting a two—year study on cheating,
More concretely, asc-ientiﬁc survey is now under

tions of man in the twentieth century. He. wants
to know how it is possible- to be a saint without

How is it possible for man to keep alive the',;.; "
essential dignity of the human being when he lives,
in a Godless world without the consolation of‘i,m'-
m.ortal‘1ife?,Yet, ‘Camus’ answer is that man- must ~
“i'e-establisha little of what constitutes ‘the dignity _
of li1’e_and death.” ‘ ~ ,
Niihilismiiis not the answer because if man can
believe in nothing else he must. believe "that the .
very fact that man iisuborn grants him an irrevoc-
able dignity which no one can usurp, This dignity ‘
can only be preserved by ﬁghting “the. plague’.;;.a, I

With More Ferceptive Viewing
Many people who are ‘disturbed by Camus“
atheism call his philosophy one of despair. How-
ever, nothing could be‘more wrong. Camusehas
said “that the. world is beautif_u1 and beyond it
there is no salvation.” All men have is a brief
space in a worldlwhich is very painful'at times,
but whose beauty cannot be denied. For ‘Camus,
the beauty of the world was intensiﬁed by his acute
consciousness of the fact that beauty.» is transitory“ _
andselusive. Beauty and tragedy co-exist, andloneﬁf
cannot feel either without being conscious of the '
other.  ' f
"Many news_papers throughout the country pub-
. lished articles about7Ca’rYi"us at the time of his
- death. Perhaps the most meaningful one appeared
in “The Christian Century,” for-it is a great tribute
to a human being if men who -disagree with -his
basic assumptions still retain a fundamental, «re-
spect for, if not agreement with, his principles."
The article in "The Christian Century” was
called “A Questioning Voice Is Stilled.” The author
of the editorial made it-clear that Camus "asked?-
questions of vital signiﬁcance to our civilization ‘
‘even he did not agree with his answers. Perhaps,
the editors realized that Camus fulﬁlled’ the Chris-
tian ethic even though he was an atheist.
For when Camus says that “there-— is more in“
men to love than to despise,” he is saying it with

 

full consciousness of the suffering that human.}be-~‘v,j:.,
ings have imposed‘ upon one another throughout 
history. . - ‘ ' '

Perhaps the only tribute that we can make‘ to

_N Camus lies in the pursuit of the objectives which.

“Camus cited in his Nobel Prize. Speech. ‘We must h
pursue the “mysterious and elusive ti;ut_1_i- which?

_must ever be one anew,’-’ along. with.liberty' “which

Informative Synposis of Russia,‘

r.-Satellites Given By John Scott

By LOIS DIAMOND {
Russian expert, John Scott took his Midday audience on
a ‘quick tour of Russia and her satellites last Monday, before
presenting a composite of her general social, economic, and

""3"

political situation.

“To know Russia’s hitch—hikers,” expressed Sott, “is
to understand the Russian people.” Remarked one hitch-

hiker: “I hope you Americans get¢

this government of ours straight.
We got rid of the Tartars; we’re
gonna get rid of these guys, too.”
Concluded Scott, “The Soviet
population has a low degree of
political acquiescence. Russians
express the dislike of their own
government in the pleasure of
meeting Americans, who are more
popular in Russia than in any
other country. .
Proud of Science _
“The average 'Russians are
proud of Russian achievements

' and science, but haven’t accepted

the government completely. They

"refer to it as ‘they’.”

‘- According to Scott, Russia has
two major weaknesses'———econom-
ically, the collective farms; and

epolitically, the power struggle.

- Thirty-nine per cent of the pop-
ulation there is in agriculture.
However, because of the collec-

, tivization of the farms, Russian
farm production is only 15% of
that of the United States.

“The collective farm is a part‘ of

;Soviet theology,” said Scott, “and

it is unlikely that anyone will sug-

gest the liquidation of these
farms.” '

Cites Reason
As far as the power struggle is
concerned, Scott believes that it is
the failure of Soviet society not
to have order to its succession.
The USSR‘is successful in its
~ industry, though.’ “In the last
thirty years the population has
learned to design, manufacture,
and use tools and machines,”
continued Scott. “The proﬁta-
. bility in one plant was 250 to
. 300 per cent, whereas‘ here a
proﬁtability. of 30.per cent is
healthy.” -
Scott's explanation for this pro-

- ‘ductivity and profitability was
A large ‘production compared to re-

«Z:
l

latively small consumption. “The
profitability is used for the high

-rate of capital formation and pre-.

para_tion for defense and war,"

affirmed.
Expresses Optimism

It has also resulted in an in-
creased export of manufactured
goods. Expressing optimism in
Russia’s future, Scott proceeded
to evaluate the policies of the
Soviet Union. “Khrushchev is un-
der heavy pressure.” said Scott.

“China, with its vigorous for-
eign policy, threatens to settle
Siberia before Russia does. The,
premier must cope with his age
andblood pressure, too——both of
which ahe too high,” Scott con-
ﬁrmed.

Russia needs quick victory in
foreign affairs. Khrushchev has
thus been striving toward these
objectives:

a. Meeting,Americans in many

ﬁelds of activity,

b. Increasing USA and USSR

trade, and ‘-

c. Taking over uncommitted

countries. — ‘’

Commenting on inspection of
atomic weapons, Scott said that
Russia will accept it on “a socio-

' logical basis, but not as a method

of political warfare.”

Scott concluded by lamenting
the situation that Russia’s ‘eco-
nomical growth is twice that of
the United States. “Our inferior
rate of growth can be plotted
arithmetical1y,” he remarked. “In
thirty years we’ll be inferior in

every area. This is undigniﬁed and ,

unpleasant in my opinion.”

LA Student M...e
Take Area Tests

All seniors and sophomores in
the School of Liberal Arts are-re-1
quired to take the Area Tests of
the Graduate Record Examination
which will be oﬁered on March
8 and 9. ' " c

These Area ‘Tests provide a
comprehensive hhppraisal of a col-

lege student’s achievement in
three principal areas of human
knowledge: social science, the hu-
manities, and natural science.

Examinations must be taken at
the following time in either the
School of Health, Professions or in
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial.

The examinations require full
use of the scheduled time, so it is
important that you arrive prompt-
ly and plan to spend the full pe-
riod. There will be no make-up
tests scheduled. ’ V

Attendance at these examina-
tions 'is considered a legitimate
excuse for absence from a con-
flicting class. Also, in order to re-
ceive a report of your scores on
these tests, each student is asked
to bring a self-addressed, stamped
envelope with him.

THE THUNDERING MARCH or PROGRESS

Today, as everyone knows, -is the forty-sixth anniversary of the

founding of Grjansinire College for Women, which, I,aseveryon‘e' »
knows, was the ﬁr‘st Progressive Education college in the '

United States. . . ’ _ ~ .
Welldo I recollect the tizzy in the academic world when
Gransmire opened its portals! What a buzz there was, what a

' brouhaha in faculty common rooms,.what a rattling of teacups,
when Dr. Agnes Thudd Sigafoos, ﬁrst president of Gransmire,

lifted her learned old head and -announced deﬁantly, “We Will
teach the student, not the course. There will be no marks,,n0
exams, no requirements. This, by George, is Progressive
Education I” . ‘ A

Well sir, forward-looking maidens all over the countryIcast
off their fetters and came rushing to New: Hampshire to enroll
at Grans'inire.~ Here, they found freedom. They broadened their
vistas. They lengthened their horizons. They unstopped their
bottled personalities. They roamed the campus in togas, lead-
ing ocelots on leashes. -

And, of course, they smoked Marlboro cigarettes. (I say, “Of I

course.” Why do I say, “Of course”? I say, “Of course” because

it is a matter of course that anyone in ‘search of freedom should .
‘ naturally turn to Marlboro, for Marlboro ‘is the smoke that sets

the spirit soaring, that unyokes the captive soul, that ﬁlls the

air with the murmur of wings. If you think ﬂavor went out"

when ﬁlters came in‘--try Marlboro. They are sold in soft pack
or ﬂip-top box wherever freedom rings.) v ,
But all was not Marlboro and ocelots for the girls of - ' na-

mire. There was workand study too-not in the ordinary sense, ‘

to be sure, for, there _were no formal classes. Instead there was
a broad approach to enlarging each girl's, potentials, both mental
and physical. — . I . p I '
Take,_forI example, the course. called_B.M.S. (Basic Motor
Skills). B.M.S. was divided into L.D‘. (Lying Dow_n),'S,.U.
(Standing Up) and W. (Walking). Once the student had mas-
tered L.DI. and S.U., she“ was taught to W:—but not just to W.
any old way! No, sir! She was taught to W. with poise,

dignity, ,bearing!_To inculcate a sense of balance in the girl, ,

she_ began her exercises by walking with a suitcase in each hand.
(One girl, Mary Ellen Dorgenicht, got so gogd at it that today
she is hell captain at the Deshlcr-Hilton Hotel in Columbus,
Ohio.) _ ‘ . ~ E -

If   at 47 zf€¢7r.z/1/rsaze   z //.-.-
Whcn the girls had walking under their belts, they were
allowed to dance. Again no formality was imposed. They were
simply told to ﬂing themselves about in any way their impulses
dictated, and, believe you me, it was quite an impressive sight
to see them go bounding into the woods with their togas ﬂying.
(Several later joined the US. Forestry Service.) ,

There was also a lot of ﬁnger painting and sculpture with ’
coat hangers and like that, and soon the fresh wind of Progres- _

sivism came whistling out of Gransmire to blew theancient dust
of pedantry offcurricula everywhere, and today, thanks to the
pioneers at Gransmire, we are all free. ‘ I , '
