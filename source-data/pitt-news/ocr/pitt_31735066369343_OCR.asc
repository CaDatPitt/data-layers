New Board Takes Oath
At SGB inauguration

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staffwriter

The 1978-79 Student Govern-
ment Board was ushered out last
evening and the 1979-80 in-
augurated at a reception/dinner
held in the Kurtzman Ballroom of
the Student Union.

Before a group of approximately
150 university and city dignitaries,
board president Stan Galanski took
an oath to “uphold the constitution
and by-laws of the student
government of the University of
Pittsburgh and to promote the
need and
welfare of the -undergraduate
students to the best of my ability.”

The oath was also administered

to board members Cindy DeMat-'

teo, Tom Kunkle, Helen Gianella,
Rita Cordisco, Todd Park and Kim
Watterson.

Galanski, in his acceptance
speech, reiterated the goals of the
new board as establishment of a
new campus bus system, an
open-air student radio station
and the carrying-out of proposed
Student" Union renovations.

“Tonight I offer a new role of

student government at Pitt,”
Galanski said. “We must not
really be content with an advisory
role. Our role must be as a student
advocate.”

“The Public and Governmental
Relations Committee must be

‘stressed as an advocate before the

state legislature. . .to keep costs of
education down.”

Galanski said the board’s Com-
muter Affairs Committee‘ “Must
take an active role.” '

Galanski’s speech touched only
one area of board concern not
promoted during his campaign--
that of the establishment of an
Academic Affairs Committee.

The new standing committee,
Galanski said, would be respon-
sible for “promoting academic
concerns” and would handle the
compilation of the Undergraduate
Academic Review.

Galanski also called for increased
participation of board members in
the activities of university councils,
senate, and task forces.

“It will be a challenge of this
board to live up to the reputation of

university and the student body is

countered by the past SGB,

“The university does very little
to reach the student,” Baylson

said. “It is up to the student to
reach the university when it should
be a bilateral relationship_.”

Baylson and six other former
SGB members finished their terms
on the board Wednesday.

Former SGB member Jan Med-
off said he found it hard to
accomplish anything because the
administration “is totally set
against the students.”

“Most administrators I've come
in contact with at Pitt are not
concerned with the students’
welfare because they view Pitt as
an institution as long as the
university is functioning, they view

students’ happiness as immater-

‘ ial," he said.

- According to former SGB mem-
ber Dave Hesidence, Pitt students
believe the university does not care
about students. _

“Pitt, more so than other
institutions of a similar nature,
seems to your average student to
be an unfeeling institution,”
Hesidence said. “To them, the
people who run the university don’t
really care."

Current President Stan Galanski
also a member of the Baylson
administration, said that it is hard
to characterize the university

administration. He said that the
administration is more of a system

than a group of individuals.

“The general trend is that any
administration is resistant to
change, although a lot of people at
Pitt are interested," Galanski said.

Former SGB member Bernie
Popko said that the university
administration was fairly coop-
erative but that the bureaucracy
was difficult to penetrate.

"It ‘is almost as if the power

to accomplish things," he said.
According to former SGB mem-
ber Diane Behers, the university

administration and the SGB hada ‘
positive working relationship, but

swift action by the administration '

on student problems was rare.

“I got the feeling that some
administrators have "the- attitude
that ‘they are just- students,’ ”
Behers said.

According to Baylson, another
problem is the overall condition of

Housing Director Outlines Tighter.
Security Measures in Towers

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

At least three major projects are
being planned to step up security
measures in the Towers, according
to Donovan Hughes, director of
housing.

Those projects under consid-
eration include: moving ‘the
laundry facility from the basement
to the lobby of Tower B, rerouting
cafeteria traffic which may involve
building a second stairwell possibly
adjacent to the existing one in the
Main Towers lobby, and making
another entrance to the mailroom.

“These are all reactions to

A

Resident Student Association “pro-
posals,” said Hughes. “Another
proposal is to secure the middle

elevator 24‘hours so that it stops-

only at every third ﬂoor.” A

Hughes said that there are two
alternatives to constructing a
separate entrance to ‘the Towers
mailroom. One is‘ to ‘make it
accessible from the outside, and
the other is to make an internal
channel running from the main
lobby. -Hughes said_-that the
internal channel is the more
feasible of the two.

"Once the mail room and
cafeteria problems are solved, the

Towers will have 24-hour secur-

ity.’ ’ he said. P‘

Hughes said that there will be
problems with 24-hour security at
first, but also said that there were

problems with 12-hour security

when it was first instituted.

For the Pitt basketball team,-nothing went
wrong. Five Panthers hit double figures, led by
forward Sammie EIlis's 24 points, there was a
record crowd of 15,208 and Pitt defeated tough
Villanova 77-64. Pitt's 25 for 27 from the foul

. line did not hurt, and Sam Clancy's 13 rebounds‘

(game high) helpeda little. To make along story
short, Pitt rushed past Villanova and into the
Eastern Eight tournament's final game last night
by standing strong against the league's regular
season winner. - -page 3 2

university all indicate to me a need
for a viable student center,” he
said. “There's no place to sit down

and talk with faculty or other‘
_ students in an atmosphere con-

ducive to study.”

The renovation of the Student
Union will help the university’s
drive to attract potential students,
according to Baylson.

“If I was Mork (from TV’s
“Mork and Mindy”), Oakland
would look like it is composed of
classrooms and bars, and a great
deal of the same kind of activities
transpires in both places,” he said.

All of the former SGB members
agreed that before they were
elected, they were unaware of the
difficulties they would face.

According to Medoff, the title of
SGB member gives_ a student
more clout when dealing with
university officials.

“Being on the board gives you a
chance to get in the doorway of
inﬂuential administrators,” Med-
off said.

Popko said that the power of
student government lies in its
ability to address the university’s
problems. He said that university
officials react to the negative

publicity that the problems gen-
erate.

According to Behers, SGB
members must accept that “you
cannot do everything you want.”

Galanski said that the SGB
should play the role of “trouble
shooter,” and that the board
should also help with individual
students’ problems.

SGB members are not full-time
personnel so they must use proper
channels to affect change within
the ‘university, said Hesidence.

“Things are accomplished by
using channels that are open,
ﬁnding what channels are not that
evident and learning how to use
informal channels,” he said. -

The former SGB members said
their .accomplishments included
publication of the Undergraduate
Academic Review, development of

revision of the Student Government
Constitution and a variety of other
accomplishments.

Baylson said that his administra-
tion was different from recent past
administrations because the mem-
bers worked well together.

“This board has been much
friendlier to each other than past
boards,” he said.

Behers agreed with Baylson’s
assessment of the SGB, saying that
during the Baylson administration,
“everyone got along well.”

According to Baylson, his ad-
ministration was concerned with
both the present and the future of
student life at the university.

“We tried to look at the
university as it exists now but also
tried to project how it will be ﬁve or
ten years from now,” he said.

Schulman Rescinds Council Vote
To Down Alternative Curriculum

By MARGI STUMPF
pm News Staff Writer

A recent College of Arts and
Sciences vote that advocated axing
the university Alternative Cur-
riculum program has been re-
scinded, according to council presi-

dent Dr. Irwin J. Schulman.

The 6-5 vote registered after last
Wednesday’s council meeting was
withdrawn, Schulman said yester-
day, because of procedural viola-
tions.

CA5 Council voted last week to
support the program, S-4-1, but the
abstaining vote was changed some
time after the meeting, making the
tally 5 to 5.

Schulman, as president, then
last week cast the deciding nay
vote, indicating his decision in a

letter mailed to council members at
the end of last week.

Schulman declined to indicate
when he was approached by the
council member as to the vote
change, saying “I’d rather not get
bogged down as to when the vote
was changed.‘

‘‘I probably made a tactical error
in changing the vote after the
It creates this kind of
confusion,” he continued.

Schulman said the council has
been “very informal” about
following Robert's Rules of Order,
a procedure manual usually refer-
red to in question of university
council meeting operations.

Additionally, the manual outlines
procedures for proxy votes, stating
such votes should be in the hands
of the presiding officer before
meeting adjournment.

“Given the circumstances, I felt
obliged to make a decision,”
Schulman said in reference to his

nay vote. “This was the most
single difficult decision I've made
since taking office.”

Schulman said his vote was cast
as such in light of the costs of the
program, which opponents say
exceed benefits, and because
reforms the council wished to see
carried out if the program
continued—-additional faculty sup-
ervision and student participa-
tion—“would be very difficult.”

Faculty members are reluctuant
to become involved in the program
because of the demands made on
their already tight time schedules,
Schulman said, and because
“ students. . .are very preoccupied
with jobs.”

Schulman said a re-vote may be
taken at the next council meeting if
a resolution to do so is introduced
by a council member. Until then,
the original 5-4-1 support of the
Alternative Curriculum program

stands.

Iranian students attending U.S.
universities are starting to receive
funds from home again, according
to Ralph Morrison, director of
International Services.

Morrison said that now that mail
is coming from Iran, students are
already receiving personal checks.

“We did receive a personal
check for a student on Monday,
which is the first we’ve had in
about two months,” Morrison said.

 Future oflran

Morrison said most Iranian
students at Pitt are funded by
private sources.

The Iranian Embassy in Wash-
ington, D.C., Morrison said, told
international services that a one
month supplement for govern-

ment-sponsored Iranian students

will arrive within a week. Morrison
added that 12 of the 68 Iranians _at
Pitt receive some government
support.

The university had attempted to
relieve the ﬁnancial burden of the

students by deferring tuition
payments and by granting’
emergency short-term loans issued
by international services.

“Only eight students needed the
short term loans at the beginning of
this week,” Morrison said. “The
situation has caused’ a lot of
anguish and has been very
problematic for the students
involved.”

“Although I have no official
information, I feel that the
government may help Iranian

“Right now, we’re talking about

“The reoccurring costs, such as

Hughes added that employees of
the university will be given badges
with their pictures on them and
steps have already been taken to
secure the garage area.

For example, the timer on the
garage door has been reduced and
there are signs posted, asking
people using the garage to wait for
the garage door to close behind
them. There has also been a new
phone installed in that area.

Also speaking last evening was

Chancellor Wesley Posvar, who
offered his congratulations to “the

“I’m sure (the new board) will

“I have worked in students

Dayoush Pirnia of the Iranian
Embassy in Washington said
earlier this week.

Pirnia added that the’ commun-

Ministry of Education in Iran is
positive.

“The government will continue
support of its students. Funds are
being transferred now,” he said.

There are about 55,000 Iranian
students in the United States at the
university level, Pirnia said.

If you‘re dissatisfied with your present birth control
method. you should know about Semicid, a real
alternative in contraception from Whitehall Laboratories.
one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies.

Semicid is safe and effective. It contains the
maximum allowable level of nonoxynol-9, an ingredient
which safely kills sperm in seconds. its the spermicide
in products doctors recommend most. and has been
used effectively by millions of women for over 10 years.
Now, this tested, proven ingredient is available in Semicid.

Semicid is safe, too. Unlike the pill, it has no hormonal
side effects. And unlike the IUD, it can't damage uterine
walls. Furthermore. Semicid does not effervesce the

.- way the other vaginal suppository does. Semicid is
non- irritating to most women. There's also no unpleasant
odor or taste. Neither you nor your partner will notice
Semicid is there at all.

Semicid is neat and convenient. Slim, only an inch
long, Semicid is so simple and easy to use. There's no
applicator. so there's nothing to fill, clean, or remove.
‘Semicid is not messy like foams. creams and jellies. And
it's not awkward like the diaphragm. it lets love-making
happen naturally. spontaneously.

Within minutes after you insert it, Semicid dissolves
and spreads a protective covering over the cervical opening
and adjoining vaginal walls.

Semicid comes in a small, discreet dispenser containing
10 suppositories. You can purchase it without a prescription.

   An Act
Of Responsibility

Letters

In a time when the university bureaucracy charges
through decision-making like Dennis Kucinich

handles the city of Cleveland’s—very swiftly with ’

nary a thought toward the needs and desires of those
affected most-i-—Irwin Shulman, dean of the College‘
of Arts and Sciences, has proven himself an excep-
tion to the rule.

Wednesday, Shulman rescinded a vote that ter-
minated Pitt’s Alternative Curriculum program.
The program had narrowly retained support in an
earlier voteby CAS council members, when an ab-
stention vote was switched to a negative one
sometime after the meeting. This put the vote at a 5-
5 deadlock and Shulman cast the deciding vote
against the program.

In reversing his decision and opting to go with the "

original vote that favored the program, Shulman
allowed that he “probably made a tactical error in -
changing the vote after the meeting.”

It is a bit much to clap Shulman on the back since
he ordered the controversial switch in the first place.
And it is a sad day that a simple reversal of opinion is

‘\

violation of student ‘rights.’ Still, the action demon-
strates a very admirable quality in Shulman, the man.

, When the recently retired Student Government
Board switched policy on recognition of the South
African coalition, they indicated neither remorse nor
reasons for switching their stance, and showed that
pinwheel politics had worked its way down the ranks.

Perhaps the comparison is not a fair one because
the CAS Council’s decision is far more important
than the SGB decision. But, if actions by the SGB or’
CAS Council are to be taken seriously and are to be
fair, we believe it is only just for those in charge to
consider the true depth of their decisions and follow
established procedures.

The time and effort saved in seemingly snap
decisions isn’t worth it when the price paid is
credibility.

lauded as a hallmark in university honesty.

Certainly, as Shulman said, the decision on the

program was a difficult one. Opponents claim it is a
waste of money and that it does not prepare students
for the day they enter the job market, but the merits‘
of the Alternative Curriculum program are not at ‘

question here. , ’

The fact that Shulman made a serious mistake
still stands. ‘ The fact that he not only admitted, but
corrected it, does not expurge an act that was a

Lack of Basketball Coverage — Who is at Fault?

Sports Information Director
Dean Billick is the worst thing to
happen to Pitt basketball since Don
Hennon graduated. Here is a man
who is supposedto be promoting
Pitt athletics and who is being paid
to do so, but to examine the way he
treats the basketball program and
players one would think he was
working for Gale Catlett.

Let's look at the Pitt basketball
program of recent years and see
what the man has and has not

i done.

—Billy Knight received no
national recognition until his senior
year when, by that time, the world
knew how great he was.

--The 1978 Converse Basketball’
yearbook, which is the Bible of
college basketball, has a picture
and forecast of every college ‘and
university in the country, except
Pitt.

—All time career leading scorer,

Larry Harris, received no All-
America recognition, no Pitzza Hut
Classic considerations, no Olympic
tryout, and no coverage in the
national magazines such as Sports
Illustrated, Basketball Weekly, and
Eastern Basketball.’

-—The greatest game in Pitt’s
recent history, the victory at Duke,
was not televised back to Pitts-
burgh because Billick thought Pitt
would be trounced.

g——As far as Sports Illustrated is
concerned, Pitt dropped basketball
several years ago.‘ Not only was the
team not even mentioned in the
college basketball issue, but a
cover story and feature on the best
sophomores in the country did not
even mention Sam Clancy, probab-
ly one of the five best sophomores
in college basketball. Despite
having a 16-8 record and being. one
of the best teams in the East and
the best team in the Eastern Eight,

Pitt has not been mentioned in
Sports Illustrated all year. The
Sports Illustrated coverage of the
Pitt-Duke game was from the
standpoint of Duke losing the
game, not Pitt winning it. And
Clancy should definitely have been
player of the week.

—The Pittsburgh media covers
Pitt basketball, if at all, as if it were
the Cuban National team. The bias

-against Pitt in favor of Duquesne in

the local papers is so obvious and
so consistent that it is a wonder
why Coach Tim Grgurich even
permits the local writers to cover
the games. No coverage at all

would be more desirable. It is a_

tribute to Grgurich’s recruiting
ability to overcome the media slant
that Pitt gets any local high school
players. . ‘

-—A't Pitt, theiterm “split crew”
does not refer to referees but rather
to the radio broadcasters.

With '

 

Billick and the loyal and lovable Bill
Hillgrove doing the basketball
games on the radio, no listener
could ever complain of biased
announcing in favor of Pitt. To the.
contrary, when tuning in Pitt
games and listening to Billick
criticize, underestimate, and in
general ridicule the Pitt players
and coaches, it is incomprehensible

how the man can continue to be’

permitted to broadcast the games.

—No one around Pitt, much less
the city, even knows Wayne
Williams is on the Pizza Hut All
Star ballot. Ignoring that possible
pro Terry Knight isn’t even on the
ballot, why doesn’t anybody know
where to get ballots? Why isn’t
voting for Wayne promoted or
encouraged or at least the
possibility to do so made aware to

. Pitt fans?

-—Unbelievably, Eastern Basket-
ball magazine, which weekly ranks
the top players in the East, did not
include Sam Clancy in its list of the
top 16 players.

a

What are the reasons for this
surely conscious effort to under-
mine Pitt basketball by Pitt’s own
sports information director? Does
Billick have something. against
Grgurich? Does football take up all
his time and effort? Does Billick
dislike the Pitt players? Does he
not enjoy the sport of basketball?
Is Billick a football groupie? ‘

Whatever the reasons, the
results are obvious. Pitt basket-
ball, which has put three players in
the pros in the last ﬁve years and
had three others drafted in the last
ﬁve years, is’ unknown nationally
and ignored and criticized in the
press locally.

The errors of omission and
commission of Billick have to have
a negative effect on recruiting.
Possibly that is why Coach
Grgurich has been going outside
the area for his players recently.

Nellie King, the sports informa-
tion director at crosstown rival
Duqesne, is so fervent in his
promotion of Duquesne basketball
that even such marginal players as.
Doug Arnold and Mickey Davila
have become household words in
Pittsburgh. And even the quotes of
Duquesne’s coach Mike Rice make
the national wire.

The true tragedy would be if Sam
Clancy is given the same neglect as
has the rest of the Pitt basketball
program this past year. Here’s
hoping he makes I the all-district
team selected by the Pittsburgh
basketball writers.

Here’s hoping also that Pitt gets
rid of Billick and gets a sports
information director who will get
Pitt and Sam Clancy the basketball
recognition they 'deserve—-—before
it’s too late.

Curriculum - Once Again Defending Alternative

According to The, University
Times, Feb. 22 issue, Dean Irwin
Schulman gave the College of Arts
and Sciences Council two options
on the question of Alternative
Curriculum. They were to discon-
tinue the program or to strengthen
the program that now exists. *2-

Dean Schulman and council
members that voted “nay” to

continue the program took the easy ‘

way. It would have been more
challenging to the dean and council
members to try to strengthen the
program.

Schulman himself in'The Univer-
sity Times said that one of the most
valuable aspects of the program
that “would be the hardest to
duplicate elsewhere in the univer-
sity is the self-initiated and
self-determined learning done by
the program.”

To the students in the program,

the self-initiated and self-deter-I

mined learning is what gives the
program its uniqueness and is the
reason_it stands apart from other
programs within CAS. To initiate
and determine one’s learning is
what education is about. This is
what Alternative Curriculum en-

hances and it is these qualities that
Schulman and the administration
should support and duplicate, not
cancel. ‘

_ The recent letters in The Pitt
News by students concerned with
their education show that large
classes of two, three, and four
hundred people are not always
valuable. The students find it
difficult to ask questions, to see a
professor, and to get the help they
sometimes desperately need.

The program promotes small
workshops where students actually
know their professors, are en-
couraged to and do ask questions,
and always find help when they
seek it. They not only get to know
and learn from their professors but
also from their fellow students. All
of this creates a feeling of group
membership that involves growing,
learning and education. According
to Schulman, “this was particularly
valuable to freshman and would be
hard, but not impossible, to
duplicate outside the program.”

But it’s easier for Schulman and
the administration to cancel this
valuable quality in the program,
instead of trying to duplicate it for
students throughout the university.

Calling for Student Input .
Like Jerry Rubin at 30

Administrators have made it
clear that budget cuts occasioned
by dropping enrollments will be
carved out of personnel, not
purchasing costs.
that they plan to extend adminis-
tration organs like recruiting and
placement, while cutting back
course offerings and the size of the
faculty.

Along came several letters to
The Pitt News calling on students
to take a more active role in
policing the faculty—one, for
example, urging students to report
bad teachers to state legislators.

In a similarly “democratic,”
warmed-over student’s power vein,
it is proposed to cut back course
offerings in those classes for which
the fewest students register. We’ll
let the students choose.

These seemingly democratic
calls for student input are worse
than Jerry Rubin at 30. They're
dictatorship by a few dressed as the
wishes of a majority.

Todav’s economy, managed by
big business and the economic
“experts” that it loans govern-
ment, has students job-scared.
Job-scared students tend to de-
mand from teachers whatever they
expect employers to demand of
job-hunting graduates. They select
courses accordingly.

It’s also clear '

What, gets felt and voiced as
student need starts out as employer
demand. Just what “quality
education” is to mean will be
defined by corporations when they
make up job descriptions. Max

I-Iorkheimer was on the scent when '

he said, “the fullest . possible
adaptation of the subject to the
reiﬁed authority of the economy--—
that is the form reason really takes
in bourgeois society.”

Doug Barber
CAS

In The University Times, Schul-
man said that he was raising the
question of the program again
primarily for ﬁnancial reasons.
When it was first established it had
a proposed budget of $121,000. It
now has a budget of only $10,000.
This program already has suffered
budget cuts to the point where they
can’t afford more than the 20
students enrolled in the program

Yet, it promotes the qualities of
an education that Schulman said he
feels are the “most valuable.” If
Dean Schulman finds these quali-
ties in an education most valuable,
why doesn't he and this adminis-
tration support and promote a
program like Alternative Curricu-
lum that has these qualities?

appointed by this administration to

The Good Folks at Duke

Travelling to Durham with the
Pitt basketball team a few weeks
ago, Iwas, of course, more than a
little anxious. Besides having to
face Banks, Gminski and all, we
had to face the Devil's Den fans.
Frankly, I was more scared of the
Duke students in stands than those
on the court. “

In fact, before the game when
the students chanted, “We’re
gonna get you” and pointed at the
Pitt team, I said to the players, ‘ ‘I’ll
see you guyslater. I'm getting out
of here before it’s too late.”

The game was excellently played
and extremely exciting, and is a
game I will never forget. But,
equally memorable for me was the
reaction of the Duke fans.

.. Naturally, they were frantically
and vociferously supportive of the
home team. Their cheers and
exhortations created something
that was nothing like I had ever
heard. ’

Yet when Sam Clancy went
down with an injury, Cameron
Auditorium became as quiet as a
tomb. One could feel the
apprehension and sincere concern
for Sam on the part of the fans.
When Sam stood up, the fans did
likewise in an ovation that was as
loud as it was beautiful.

I have seen visiting players go
down with injuries‘ and arise to

mild, polite applause. But, I had
never seen such a genuine
outpouring of concern and admir-
ation for a visiting player.

When the ﬁnal buzzer sounded
and the stunning upset became
history, the Pitt team headed for its
locker room. Again, the Duke
students arose and applauded and
gave the Pitt players--the Pitt
players who had just knocked off
their beloved Devils and who had
just dropped the Devils from their
lofty national ranking--a warm
standing_ovation. I looked back at
the students and could not believe
what I saw.

Later, to prove the student
reaction at Cameron was not an
illusion, the people at Duke Pika
house where the Pitt players were
invited to party, were more that
hospitable. The Duke students
partied and celebrated with the
Pitt players and lavished praise on
them.

They wished the players luck the
rest of the season, told them they
were one of the best teams in the
country and even had the Pitt
players pose for pictures with
them. There was no way an
observer could tell that these
players partying with Duke
students were visiting players.

The reason I am writing is to let
you people at Duke know that you

This is why we pay them. But, we

easier for Schulman and this

are, without question, the greatest
basketball fans in the world. I have
been to the Palestra, to Syracuse,
and to many other places, and have
found the fans in all those places to
be simply hometown fans. You are
basketball fans. You know good
basketball, you appreciate it and
you show your love of the game
above all else.

Not only are you the best
basketball fans, but you are the
classiest.

I just want you to know that the
Pitt players are still talking about
the Duke fans. They cannot get
over the reception they received
after upsetting the best team in the
nation on its home floor.
Moreover, they can’t wait to come
back down there and I hope it will
be soon.

As for me, I hope Duke wins the
A.C.C. tournament and goes all the
way to the Eastern Regional
Championship. I can’t say yet
whether I want you to win that
game though,’ since hopefully Pitt
will be there too.

In closing, I want to thank you
people at Duke for not only a great
weekend and fantastic game, but
for some memories I will always
cherish. .

You people are truly’ special.

‘Mrs. Daly Has a Lover
Directed by Daphne Czernobilsky
Studio Theater

By COLLEEN MCDONALD
Pitt News Staff Writer

When lunch hours become
unexciting or midday oblivion sets
in, an afternoon break ﬁlled with a
bit of theater could prove to be
refreshing. It’s readily available at
the Studio Theater’s new Lunch-
' time Theater Festival held Tues-
days and Wednesdays. The.crowd
is small and intimate; the suggest-

ed donation is 50 cents; and fresh
fruit and coffee are offered. _

Of course, the best part is the
actual- performance. This past
week’s featured production was the
realistic drama of “Mrs. Daly Has
a Lover.”, The one-act .playlet,
directed by Daphne Czernobilsky,
delivers to the‘ audience a
compelling message on human life
and love.

The play began as a class project
for a Directing I course offered by
Pitt’s theater department. Czerno-.

bilsky selected her own actors, then
collected_ . scenery and, with -the
help of Gil Elvgren, perfected the
act to present it as a piece of her
own directing creativity.

The play opens in a kitchen
suggestive of the 1950s, where-
upon Mrs. Daly, played by Patty
Peltz, enters in a housecoat and
slippers and proceeds to pick a
man's shirt up off the floor. She
presses the shirt close to her heart
and then lays it on a chair. Frankie

 ' Leo Tolstoy is considered one of
the greatest novelists in history.
The author of “War and Peace”
and “Anna Karenina” was a
member of Russian nobility, yet he
went insane at the peak of his
career anddied alone in a railway

The University of Pittsburgh

, Theatre is celebrating Tolstoy's
150th birthday this month with a
.festival featuring the world pre-

The two act play is set during
the last ﬁve days of Tolstoy’sJife,
and centers on his deserted wife,
Sonya, who kept vigil at the station,
waiting to see her husband to beg
for a reconciliation. During the ’
wait, she relives the tragedy of her
marriage to a man she both loved
and hated. Tolstoy does not appear
as a character in the play.

Sonya will be played by Joselyn

Theatre Express
To Produce
_ ‘The Bacchae’

By FORREST BUFFENMYER
Pitt News Staff Writer

Whenever most people think of
seeing a play they probably don’t
care how old it is. But with the new
Theatre Express production of
“The Bacchae” this is clearly a
concern, since it has been around
for 1,375 years. However,
according to director Dennis
Aubrey it is “still relevant to our
times.”

John Wells, an independent
producer, is responsible for bring-
ing this Greek mythology-based
play to Theatre Express.

“Dennis and I feel a meat-and-
potatoes, straight-on approach to
such a popular play as this one is
better than treating it as some type
of great scholastic classical exer-
cise; and the importance of the
narrative is relevant to these
times,” said Wells.

‘Another reason this play is being
presented is that the performers
have.formed the Pacific Repertory
Company and are relocating to
California in June to begin , a
36-week season there. In the time
they have been in Pittsburgh,
however, from October to April,-
they will have performed six
shows, "Bacchae” being the fourth
in this series. Two original plays,

definitive book ‘ever written on pot.

It's neither ultra-conservative propa-
ganda nor radical hype, but rather a well
researched, incisive and entertaining
kaleidoscope of America’s longest run-
ning and most disobeyed prohibition.

Sloman, who was in Pittsburgh
Tuesday and Wednesday to promote his
book, said one thing which struck him in
his prelininary research was that “too

many of the (marijuana) books had a

1960s orientation.” This being the last
year of the 70s, Sloman felt it was high
time (pun intended) for an update.

K Q a _ ‘ What that update reveals» is that

r

‘people of all

marijuana, which first gained national
attention in the early part of this century,
has smoked its way into the lives of
approximately 25 million Americans. It’s
no longer the darling of just jazz
musicians and hippies. but is used by
ages, races, political
affiliations and socio-economic groups.

“Pot has been demystifiegl," said
Sloman. -

One section of the book,
“Middle-Class Marihuanists,” exposes
just how commonplace the recreational
and, to a lesser degree, medical use of the
drug has become.

“Reefer Madness,” titled after the
19505’ propaganda flick, goes back to the
grass roots (pun intended again) of
marijuana in this country and examines
early uses and users and how the drug
came to be so infamous and eventually
out—lawed. The reading is very
interesting. Consider the following:

, Marijuana was originally a cash crop.
used for making rope and clothes. ‘In
-1762, Virginia levied penalties against

51-

titled

those who did not grow it and one of the
original pot farmers was Geroge~
Washington. ' '

The first “pot heads” were minorities,
primarily Mexican immigrants and
Southern blacks, which is one reason the
drug fell into,disfavor in a very racist
country. ’ P’

Harry Anslinger, a native of Altoona,
Pa., after a losing battle against alcohol.
became the country’s first super narc in
1930 when he was appointed the first
Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of

1 Narcotics.

Seperate legislation, the Marijuana Tax
Act of 1937, was necessary to outlaw pot
because it had originally been excluded

' from the Harrison Act of 1914, which

regulated narcotic drugs.

Sloman has well-documented the
history of pot's legal hassels. Much of his
research was done in the Drug
Enforcement Agency (DEA) library in
Washington and the Anslinger Archives

~ at Pennsylvania State University. He
described his stay at the DEA, with raised ., ,_ reading.  _ ..,

eyebrows, as being “quite interesting."
“Reefer Madness” is an excellent
expose’ of the social history of marijuana.
It touches all bases and deals with the
wide spectrum of people associated with
pot over the years—-from the adamant
Anslinger to Keith Stroup, the recently
resigned founder of” the National
Organization to Reform the Marijuana
Laws (NORML), pot's most powerful
lobby. '

Sloman, also author of “On The Road
With Bob Dylan: Rolling With The

, Thunder” and a frequent contributor to

such national magazines as Rolling Stone,
Crawdaddy and Penthouse, colors in the
book nicely with his own mildly sarcastic
style.

If Pitt’s sociology department ever
develops a course on marijuana,
“REEFER MADNESS” would have to be
the standard text. ;Regardless of that

inevitability, it’s certainly required

By GEORGE F. FRANKS III

Women have been in the three
major U.S. armed forces academies
for almost three years. Tuesday
night CBS-TV featured a two-hour
television movie “Women at West
Point.” This was the first dramatic

production about women entering

one of the academies.

I looked forward to seeing it, but
with some trepidation. Television
and cinema often give a very
distorted picture of the service
academies. Also, I spent three
years at the U.S. Naval Academy as
a midshipman where I witnessed
the last all-male year and the first
coed one.

_I praise the people who made

“.Women at West Point.” The
movie was realistic and accurate,
and gave a balanced view of the
first years with women. Though I
cannot comment on specifics about

. West Point, the depiction of service

academy life and the problems with
the entry of women were remin-
iscent of my experiences while at
Annapolis. ‘ -A
Most men at the academies were
against women invading their
sacred world.
officially announced to the brigade
of midshipmen that Congress had
passed a bill allowing women to
enter the academy, nearly all the
midshipmen booed and yelled.
That was just the beginning of a

year of transition.

When a captain 1

The Class of 1979,10 which I

; belonged, felt strongly about being

the last all-male class. Our plebe
year we followed the custom of
designing a class crest for our pins
and rings. We included on the
crest the Latin words for “all
male.”

By the end of my plebe year, the
academy was prepared for the
women but the midshipmen were
not. Women’s lavatories were
installed in the 4,300 person
dormitory, Bancroft Hall. For the
ﬁrst time a woman became the
officer of ‘the watch in the
dormitory building.

Finally, lectures on how to
handle the women were given.
These included what to do if they

cried, orders to call them women--
not girls and orders not to play
favorites.

When I returned to the academy
in September 1976 after my
training cruise, the women of the
class of 1980 already had com-
pleted their summer training. The
upperclassmen are always anxious
to check-out the new plebes or
fourth‘c'lassmen, but it was even

more true that year. The men were

‘going to make the women prove
themselves.

At the naval academy, the
women were in the same dorm and
companies as the men. Some
companies did not have women
because they were on the ground
ﬂoor. This resulted from the

these final performances.

Aubrey pointed out that a good
number of Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity theatre graduates have left
Pennsylvania to go on to things
elsewhere, such as American

Conservatory Theatre in San
Francisco and the Production
Company in. New York.

Both men expressed an apprecia-
tion to CMU for the help it has
given them. “I feel the Fine Arts
Department of Carnegie-Mellon is

really behind the student’s studio
interests as well as scholastic

interests, and they are responsible’

for allowing us to develop our
reperfory, ” Aubrey said.

Wells pointed out that in this
production, Theatre Express pro-

Director Gil Elvgren . said the
play is an exciting challenge to the

cast and crew.

“If Tolstoy could have written a
play about the last days of his life,
he would have written something in

depth and intensity very much like

“A Death in Astapovo,” Elvgren
said.’ V . ‘

provides costumes, sets, and other
theatrical equipment.

In regard to the accessibility of

. the audience to such an old play,

Aubrey stressed its modern rele-
vance. '

-“People establish civilization.
The truth is that the very rules they
live by repress their animal
instincts, which must be ex-
pressed. That's why this violence
appears senseless, because its
expression has no logical basis,”
Aubrey said. ‘

“The Bacchae” will play at
Theatre Express March 1 through
4, with presentations at 8 p.m. each
night. Additionally, there will be
two 2 p.m. matinees on Saturday
and Sunday.

administration’s fear of curious
journalists and tourists.

To the surprise of the male
midshipmen, the women ﬁt in well
and proved themselves. They were
tested mentally, physically and
emotionally. All plebes have it
tough because they have many
duties and are constantly under the
scrutiny of the upperclassmen. For
the women this was even more
true. , ’

The year was not without
incident. The women were
unofﬁcially dubbed ‘ ‘plebettes. ’ ’
Jokes about them abounded. One
woman heard an upperclassman

‘swear while walking back to the

dorm after a grueling navigation
exam.

She asked him for his name so
she could turn him in for demerits
(swearing is technically un-officer-
like conduct). This was the worst
thing she could I have done.

Promptly, two of his classmates V

began to chew her out. She
became a target for all upperclass-
men.

Other women had their own‘

trials. Some complained that they
were being harassed. Just as in
“Women at West Point,” a
“plebette” was interviewed by a
newspaper reporter and mis-
quoted, and she suffered as. a
result. Some women were the
subject of criticism because they
could not run ‘the mile in the
required six-and-one half minutes.

One cried after a poor seven-and-

a-half minute trv.

Romance was a key part. of
“Women at West Point.” Many
women at Annapolis got “dear
Jane letters” from the boys they
left behind. Female plebes and the
upperclassmen were not to frater-
nize and all plebes were not
allowed to “drag” (date).

Though I do not know if there

was kissing in the library as shown a

in “Women at West Point”
Annapolis women did have roman-
ces with upperclassmen. Calls
were made from opposite phone‘
booths in the dormitory for safety,
and for eye contact in one case.

Now, women at the service
academies are an accepted fact.
They have proven themselves to
the men and to each other.

Panthers To Play For Championship

Pitt 77, Villanova 64

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Sports Editor

Two down, one to go.

Thanks to some pretty incredible
free throw shooting, the . Pitt
basketball Panthers _ will meet
Rutgers in the Eastern Eight ﬁnals *
tomorrow night at the Civic Arena.
Pitt was a 77-64 winner over
regular season league champion
Villanova and was nearly perfect in
its shooting from the foul /line,
making 25 of 27 shots. g

Villanova, called by Wildcat
coach Rollie Massimino, “a good
team, not a great team,” fell
behind by eight points early in the

game and could never catch the
surging Panthers.

Five Pitt players hit double
ﬁgures, led by forward Sammie
Ellis’ 24 points and nine rebounds.
Center Sam Clancy’s 13 points
included one patented Sam Bam
Slam and, in the second half when
the game got a little tighter, a
reverse layup around two Villanova
defenders. Guard Carlton Never-
son also scored 13 points, followed
by Wayne Williams and Pete
Strickland with 10 a piece.

Not surprisingly, Clancy led all
players in the rebound category
with 13, while Wildcat Alex
Bradley led Villanova (15-13) with
seven rebounds and 17 points.

A record crowd of 15,208 (34,907

   
     

.3.   ......... ..

so far in the entire tournament) saw
Pitt (18-10) jump out to-a 12-4 lead
six minutes after the opening
tipoff. While Villanova made its
expected late-game comeback, it
was not up to ‘the Panthers’
stubborn full-court pressure.

Pitt coach Tim Grgurich said
Wednesday evening “We know
what we did wrong against
Villanova the first time...we didn’t
make our free throws.”

Grgurich had no complaints on
the subject last night.

Field goal percentages were
average on both sides. Pitt hit on
45‘ percent of its shots, while
Villanova completed 41 percent.
Strickland was perfect in his
shooting, making both of two ﬁeld
goals and all six free throws. ”

“Pete played the way he did
during the second half of the
season for us last year,”’ said
Grgurich.

Villanova managed to keep close
to Pitt in the waning minutes
mainly because the Panthers’
starting ﬁve totaled 21 personal
fouls and Pitt eventually lost Ellis
and Terry Knight.

“When our guys got into foul
trouble,” said Grgurich, “We just

»told them to go out and play and

that we can’t hold back now.”

Rutgers remains the only East-
ern Eight team undefeated by the
Panthers. Pitt got back at George
Washington Tuesday in the open-
ing round of the tournament and
with last night’s victory only the
Scarlet Knights stand in the way of
the Panthers making a trip to
Providence, Rhode Island for the
NCAA tournament.

“I’m happy we’re playing
Rutgers,” said Williams. “That’s
the way we wanted it. We respect
them and they respect us.”

“These are the three teams we
wanted to play,” ‘agreed Knight.
“They were the ones who beat us

this year.”
And now there is one.

Cagers Hold the (Free Throw) |.ine

By CRIS HOEL

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt strode past Villanova and.

into the Eastern Eight tourna-
ment’s ﬁnal game last night by
standing, conﬁdent, at the foul line
that had wrested victory from the
Panthers nine nights before at
Villanova’s tiny campus gym.

The Panthers led by 10 points
with little more than two minutes
remaining in the teams’ regular-
season meeting but returned from
Philadelphia shaken losers, victims
of suicidal free throw shooting.
Last night’s lead with two minutes
remaining was six; the Wildcats
had scored seconds earlier after
stealing a Pitt pass under the

' Villanova basket.

Three seconds later, Pitt’s
Wayne Williams was awarded one
free throw because of a backcourt
foul, with a bonus shot to follow a
successful ﬁrst attempt. Nine
nights earlier, in a similar
situation, a one-and-one to Pitt

3"°"°°.'.9 °"°‘° often became one missed foul shot

followed by one quick Villanova
score.

But, Pitt’s prowess at the foul
line eliminated Villanova last night;
Williams watched his pair of shots
fall through the hoop and then
watched Clancy repeat the trick 30
seconds later. Pete Strickland sent
four more free throws to the
scoreboard that showed Pitt to hold
a 77-64 edge at game’s end.

Foul shots were the difference,”
Williams said, “but I'm not sure
what the difference at the foul line
was. It might be psychological, but
you» should be confident all the
time. You try just as hard on the
ones you miss as you do on the ones
you make.”

Pitt made 25 of 27 attempts from
the foul line at the Civic Arena last

night. Twelve attempts during the ’

ﬁnal three minutes produced 11
points, and the type of win Pitt
believed it could have earned the
ﬁrst time it met the Wildcats this
season. "

(“I told our» guys after the

Villanova loss that if we had made
our foul shots we could have won
by 10,” Pitt coach Tim Grgurich
said after last night’s win, which
gave the Panthers an 18-10 record.
“Tonight, we proved that to be
true.”

Pitt also proved its inside game,
aided by ﬁne play from guards
Williams, Strickland and Carlton
Neverson, could ravage an op-
ponent with precision and aggres
sion.

Sam Clancy gave Pitt 13
rebounds that intermittently

. punctuated the action by exclama-

tion points; Sam Ellis was content
to offer Pitt plain points—24 of
them, four by slam and eight by
perfect foul shooting.

“I just wanted to take it inside
tonight,” said Ellis, whose base-
line play gave Pitt eight points
during a four-minute stretch that
preceded Pitt’s final foul-shooting
spree. “I knew .1 could score
against them if I went to the
basket...1 was too quick for them.”

Zangrilli ﬂiankful ﬂocke y Season Over Against Navy

ByKARENKADlLAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

I Pitt hockey player Al Zangrilli is
relieved that Pitt’s hockey team
(8-10) closes its season this
weekend against Navy at Annapo-
lis.

“Now I can get some schoolwork
done,” said Zangrilli, a computer
science major. “I haven’t done
that much this term because I
really haven’t had the time to do‘
any.”

As president of the Hockey Club,
Zangrilli has spent most of the
season arranging game and prac-
tice schedules, lining up game
officials, making travel plans,
balancing the budget and as he
says, “basically making sure
everything goes all right.”

As a result; the junior from
Pittsburgh has had little time to

W study.

“It gets to be a headache at

times, but I want to be president
because I don’t want our program
to fall,” said Zangrilli, noting that
he probably would not have as
many, if any, administrative duties
if hockey was recognized as a
varsity sport by the Pitt athletic
department.

Despite his many off-tne-ice
responsibilities, Zangrilli, one of
Pitt’s leading defensemen, is
enjoying his finest season.

“At times, the job (of being
president) does cause some on-the-
distractions, but it’s something I
can live with,” Zangrilli said.

What the junior doesn’t like,
however, is Pitt’s losing record, its
first in team history.

“Things haven't been the same
since Len Barclow (former Panther

coach) died last spring,” Zangrilli
said. “I know his loss really

affected us at the beginning of the
season, when we had tons of
organizational problems and didn’t
really have any respect for the
coach (Bob Montgomery). I

“The situation’s improved since

Dan Tucci became coach, but

losing Len really hurt.”

HOCKEY NOTES: « The
Panthers have two games against
Navy-one on Saturday and one on
Sunday.

D’Amico and DeMarino to Lead Gymnasts in Saturday Meets

I
By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Sta! f Writer

Frank D’Amico and Donna
DeMarino Sanft have a common
problem—the two must lead their
respective gymnastics teams into
competition against formidable
opponents Saturday at Trees Hall.

D’Amico’s Panthers will face
Farmingdale State, a team which
has scored in the 190’s this season.
.Pitt has also been scoring in that

same scoring range.

‘‘It could be a really tight meet,”
said D’Amico. “Our guys will be
going all out to score 200 points.”

D’Amico said that he would like
to see the Panthers score 200 for
the four seniors on the team.

“I’ve known these guys since
they were freshmen, and I’d like
for them to be able to say that they
were members of the first Pitt
gymnastics. team ever to score 200
points.”

Those four seniors include Doug
Smith, Dave Rich, Tony Savelli and
Mitch Spero. Smith competes in
the all-around, Rich is a rings
specialist, Savelli specializes in the
ﬂoor exercise and Spero is ~ a
sidehorse competitor.

“I can’t say enough about Doug
(Smith),” said D’Amico. “When
he first came here, he had little
experience and had to work from
the bottom up.”

D’Amico said that each of the
other three seniors has shown a

great improvement this year in his
routine.

“We are a young team and 200
points should be one of our lower
scores next year,” D’Amico said.

The Pantherettes will have their
hands full with undefeated second-
ranked Penn State. Pitt (ranked
17th) lost to the Lady Lions earlier
this season 140.2-128.65, but Sanft
is looking forward to the rematch.

“As a coach, I'm very happy to
get the opportunity to meet them
again,” she said. “We sort of blew
the last meet and this will give the
girls an opportunity to see how
they’ll fare against similar compe-
tition in regionals and nationals.”

Competing all around for Pitt will
be Myra Bachuchin, Bonnie Tress-
ler, Roxanne -Evans and Holly
Martino. This is the first time that
Pitt will be using a full lineup at
home since the beginning of the
season, according to Sanft.

“We need a super team score if
we hope to qualify for nationals,”
said Sanft. “We’re shooting for
something around 134 to 136;
hopefully 136.”

Sanft said that Pitt (6-3) could
give the Lady Lions a run for their
money.

“We seem to compete much
better when the competition is
better, and Penn State is a super
team,” she said. “I’d like to give
them a close meet.”

..~..

Pitt’s Al Meyers will compete In the all-around as the men gymnasts host Farmlngdale State at Trees Gym on Satur-
day, 7 p.m. The women host secondranked Penn smtgygy the same time.

Trackmen Visit
Eastern Michigan
At Ypsilanti

By JOE’ BRANDT
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt track squad will close its
indoor season this weekend with a
meet at Eastern Michigan, but
much of the team will not make the
trip to Ypsilanti, Mich.

Head coach Mike Agostinella
said he has decided to use‘Eastern
Michigan as a tune-up for about
half of his squad, while the rest of
the team prepares for the start of
its outdoor season.

“This meet will be used to‘ help
out our runners who didn’t quite
reach their maximum for indoors.”
said assistant coach Mel Boyd. He
added that most of the runners will
be running individually (with the
exception of the mile relay team),

so they may improve on their ’

personal records. /

Coach Dan Goodyear also will be  

keeping all of his jumpers at home,
including standouts Tim Black-r
shear and Larry Kinney.

“Personally, I believe the
facilities at Eastern Michigan are
not very good, and I don’t want to
risk having any of my jumpers
being hurt.” he said. _

After the Eastern Michigan
meet, the Panthers will be idle for
four weeks, before opening up their
outdoor season at the University of
Virginia Invitational at Charlottes-
ville on March 30. They will be
home on May 11 to host the Pitt
Invitational at Pitt Stadium, their
only home appearance of the
outdoor season.

Women Tracksters
Down Ohio, 80-25

By ANGELA VAVITHES
Pitt News Staff Writer

The women's track team (2-1)
easily out-ran, out-jumped and
out-threw younger Ohio University,
80-25, Wednesday at the Field
House.

Injuries and illnesses hurt the
squad, but Pitt coach Alfreeda Goff
claimed her team “did well under
the circumstances.”

“We've had a lot of girls sick
because the flu’s going around,"
Goff said. “Sometimes this year,
including our own invitational,
places have been decided by how
healthy our girls were."

Wednesday's meet with Ohio
wasn't a fast-paced, record-setting
occasion.

“There were no record times
today,” said Goff, “but then I

West Virginia's Mountaineers
entered the Civic Arena last night
looking to upset Rutgers for the
second time this season, but after
the final buzzer sounded, the
Scarlet Knights had survived
WVU's late comeback to win, 55-52
and to advance into tomorrow
night's Eastern Eight Champion-
ship game at the Civic Arena.

WVU Coach Gale Catlett was
furious after the game, criticizing
everything from the officials to the
league itself. But, Catlett may look
back on a piece of strategy he
employed in the first half and see
that he may have been a culprit
himself.

With three minutes left in the
half and WVU trailing, 24-18, the
“Cat" decided to take the air out of
the ball and work for the final shot.
Reserve center Mike Richardson
got the ball in low with nine
seconds left in the half and charged
into the defender.

Rutgers quickly brought the ball
down court and Kelvin Troy hit a
12-foot jumper with three seconds
left on the clock to give the Knights
an eight point lead at the half.
26-l8.

Rutgers shook off a poor half of
shooting and came out smoking
after intermission.

James Bailey scored 10 points to
give Rutgers its biggest lead of the
night at 43-30.

Then WVU made its move,
inspired by at least 5,000 loud West
Virginians in the stands. Led by
the long range shooting of guards
Dana Perno and Lowes Moore,
WVU came within one at 45-44 at
the 5:08 mark.

Daryl Strickland, who led Rut-
gers with 18 points, hit both ends of
a one-and—one to raise the lead to
three. Lowes Moore drove the lane
and scored to get the Mountaineers
back to a one-point deﬁcit. A
James Bailey slam discouraged
West Virginia and the Knights held
on to win.

The Pitt women dominate
almost every event. All three rela
teams-the 880, mile and two-mil
—won by large margins.

The Pantherettes also captured";
top honors in the high jump.
Goff is optimistic about ne
weekend's Easter Regionals.

“I hope to be in the top four,
places," Goff claimed. “We wer
ﬁfth last year and I'd like to mov
up one place a year.

“The team's ready both phys I
cally and mentally. We just have t 2
wind-down before we can key-up-
for the Easterns."

Goff said that the team's real,
strength lies in the sprinting events?
between the 50- and 880-yard dash.
This is where she expects her team
to perform their best against the
tough Eastern teams.
