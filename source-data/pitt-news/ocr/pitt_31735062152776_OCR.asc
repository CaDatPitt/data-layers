Results of Weeks of Grilling
Work, to be Pitted Against
Wooster and Allegheny in An-
nual Triangular This Evening.

Much-Mooted Question of Dis-

Attraction in Local Contest.

solved: That the United States
I , d initiate a policy of govern-
mental responsibility for the natives
of the Philippines, to culminate in
independence in 1925,” is the subject

‘ on which the Pitt debating team will

meet the men from Allegheny in the
local, contest of the annual triangular
debate with Allegheny and Wooster.
This battle of forensics will occur this
‘evening in 107 Thaw hall. The judges
-chosen for the contest are: W. J. Kay,
W.  J..'- C. M. Brown, Grove City and
W.‘ . George, Geneva. 7

While the home team, composed of
C. W. Florence ’18,' S. A. Melnick ’18,
and S. N. Criep '18, is upholding the
aﬁrmative of the question, a second
team with W. C. Arthur ’17, S. N.
Bazel '18, and Arthur Kornhauser ’18
will be at Wooster with the declaration
that our dependencies in the Paciﬁc
are not yet ready for such an attempt
at’ self-government. The men from
Allegheny are Messrs. Robert Koehler,
John Bright and George Witter and
Wooster is represented by Johnson,
Millar and Alexander.

By agreement between the teams,
the word “Independence” as used in
the question is deﬁned as ‘,‘the same de-

_ of national freedom as the
nited States now allows Cuba.”
Under the rules of the contest, the
constructive speeches ‘ire limited to
twelve minutes, and in addition the
ﬂrsttwo speakers on either side will
be allowed five minutes more in which
to refute all_ possible arguments of the

 opposing team. The third and last
' speaker will be given an‘extra three,

minutes, -or eight in all, to drive home

"the cumulative argument of his side.

Under this plan, each team will have
the opportunity to gather up and de-
liver in a compact form the several
distinct threads which have been pre-
sented during the course of the debate.
Great care has been exercised as well
in the selection of the judges in order
impartial

While success has not, to a great
degree, attended the efforts of the
University debating teams in these
contests for the last two years, every-
thing made possible by hard and earn-
est work is being done to secure a
complete victory in 1915. Last year
the teams won at ‘Allegheny and lost
to Wooster here at Pittsburgh; while
in 1918, the Gold and Blue was com-
pelled to bow before superior teams
from’ both their competitors. The
negative team left, this morning for
Wooster, spurred on by the opportunity
to mar the Ohio school’s proud boast
that they have not been defeated upon
their own ﬂoor for a number of years.
With such an incentive, even the draw-

- back of a hostile crowd will be neutral-

ized and the upholders of our colors
are determined to -make the long
months of training show the necessary
results. ‘ ' ‘ '

All the students and their friends
are invited to attend the debate this
evening. The contest will open at
eight o’clock and no admission will be
charged.

OFFICIALS DECEIVED
BY CALL OF SPRING.

A WEEKLY reporter was horriﬁed
on Wednesday afternoon when on
crossing the campus he discovered that
gambling was going on openly and
without an effort to concealment. The
game was being enjoyed by several
young men of -innocent appearance.

It is not known yet who these
violators of public morals are, but an
official of the University was seen to
observe them while in the midst of
the game and he will no doubt take
steps for their apprehension. '

It was learned howverer that the
offenders were not University students
and that the marbles were bought in
Oakland.

FRESH ESTABLISH
NEWS BUREAU.

If you see any freshmen running
about the campus with pencils and
notebooks in their hands trying to
interview you, do not think that they
have gone mad. They are only try-
ing to get a news item for the
WEEKLY. s ‘ 

Most of the freshman .class have
become reporters for the PITT
WEEKLY. G. M. P. Baird, of the
English department has decreed that
every member of his classes must, as
part of their regular classroom work,‘
send in a story on any news item
concerning the University, and due
credit will be given for the work,
whether published or not. In accord-
ance with this decree, the freshmen
reporters are everywhere looking for
stories, some of which, having passed
the reﬁning ﬁre of the editorial staff
appear in this issue of the WEEKLY.

JOURNALISM HEAD '
RECEIVES PROMOTION.

The announcement was made this
week that T. R. Williams, for several
years head of the journalism depart-
ment of the University, and managing
editor of the Pittsburgh Press, had
been appointed business manager of
the Press. Mr. Williams came to
Pittsburgh more than a decade ago
and since then has held a number of
different positions "on the editorial
staff of the Press. In addition to
his newspaper and teaching duties, he
is a member of the University Advis-
ory Board on Student Activities and
also on the advisory board of the
PITT WEEKLY. ‘

PASTOR SPEAKS AT
EDUCATION CHAPEL.

Dr. H. M. Cook, pastor of the Oak-
land Baptist Church, gave an address
at the assembly of the School of Edu-
-cation, Wednesday, March 3, 1915.
Dr. Cook spoke on “Making a Teach-
er.” He said, that ﬁrst of all his
body, mind and heart. Then he must
have a great, big broad outlook on
life and he must also believe in the
“goodness of the world.” Then lastly,
but not least, Dr. Cook’s teacher must
“see the man” that is in the student
and develop that inward man so as to
bring out the very best that is in him
both for his own good and for the
good of his,neighbors. Dr. Cook
closed by saying, that all teachers
should strive to be like the one
supreme teacher of all creation.

APPROPRIATION '
BEFORE ASSEMBLY.

Assemblyman Lauler, of Allegheny
County, Monday, introduced a bill
appropriating $1,275,000 to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

The apportionment of the fund as
made in the bill includes $750,000 for
general maintenance and purchase of
apparatus, $125,000 for an addition to
the School of Mines building,,$150,000
for an addition to the School of Med-
icine, and $250,000 for the erection of

- a_ building for the School of Educa- '

Ion.

This bill, if passed, will not only
effect the above maintained schools
but will give the College room to ex-
pand in its present quarters "which it
now shares with the School of ‘Educa-

tion and the School Mi_n_es._‘

SUPHUMURE BANQUET
PRDDUBES “PEP”

The annual banquet of the sopho-
more class of the University was held
in the English room of the Fort Pitt
Hotel on Monday night. a

The banquet was held at the expense
of the freshman class, $125 being col-
lected from the plebe caps, $75 of this
being voted to be spent at the banquet.
After seventy-ﬁve men had partaken
of a $1.25 “feed” at the popular price
of $.50.
man of the Finance Committee, de-
clared dividends on the ﬁfty cents that
had been deposited that evening.
Every member of the sophomore class
who attended the “feed” will have
some of the money refunded.

The sophomores, in accordance with
the usual tradition of the breaking up
of the banquet by the plebes, did not
expect the banquet to beheld without
a few interruptions by some nervy
freshman, but no, attempts were made
to break up the spirit and enthusiasm
that prevailed among the vigilant
sophomores during the evening. Al-
though a rumor was spread among
the students that the freshmen had
succeeded in kidnapping the president
of the class. Such was not the case.
The sophomores it is said expected
obstacles of this kind before reaching
the hotel, but no freshmen were seen.

At 9 o’clock about seventy-ﬁve
members of the sophomore class sat
down complacently at the dinner and
partook of the eatables furnished by
the ﬁrst year men. Toastmaster
“Jack” Thompson opened the after-
dinner program by introducing Dean
H. B. Mellor of the School of Mines,
who spoke on the “Responsibilities of
the Sophomore.” This was followed
by a vocal solo by H. A. Elder.
Impromptu speeches were given by
J. — K. Miller, L. G; Welsh, B. M.
McPartland, Ian Forbes and R. D.
Peck. W. T. Canan played a piano
solo, and also played for the harmoniz-
ing, when the class joined in the sing-
ing of Pitt songs, and the giving of
class yells. . . ,

sruci nuom HELPER

 

Following a series of thefts in the
University, Lawrence Sellers, a colored
boy, assistant to the storekeeper of
the chemical department, was arrested
last Saturday charged with several
thefts. Sellers is 19 years old and has
been employed by the University for
more than a year.

On Thursday of last week Prof. F.
C. Phillips, before starting to work in
the laboratories, hung his coat on ‘a
hook in the corridor of Thaw hall.
When he returned he found that his
wallet, containing $105 in cash, a check
for $212 and some valuable papers
had been removed from his coat and
the contents taken. The empty purse
was found nearby.

Sellers was arrested on Saturday.
He is said to have confessed to steal-
ing Prof. Phillips’ wallet and several
other articles. On Sellers’ person and
at his home were found some of the
stolen articles, together with goods he
had bought at the University book
store and elsewhere.

Sellers bought several articles at
two different times at the book store
Friday. On each occasion he paid
cash, displaying several bills. His
total purchases amounted to nearly
$25. Those things together with a
camera purchased at the Atwood
Pharmacy for $10, were recovered
after Sellers’ arrest. Sellers had
about $40 remaining out of the money
taken from Prof. Phillips.

The boy confessed to the theft of a
moving» picture camera which was
stolen from the University last year.
The stolen machine was found in a
pawn shop at the time, but there was
not sufficient evidence to connect any-
0 e of the theft, Sellers however was
discharged.

His mother pleaded so hard in his
behalf and urged so piteously her need
of his weekly salary, which is $3.50,
that the young fellow was taken back.

A great deal of laboratory. material
has been given out to students with-
out pay being received it is said.
Sellers is released on bail, his trial
being set for today.

.“MAX|XE GIRL” GREAT
FINANCIAL SUCCESS

At the regular meeting of the
student activities advisory committee
last Tuesday evening, the managers
of the" Cap & Gown club presented a
report on" the recent play given at the
Schenley theatre. In addition to its
being the most successful show ever
given from the standpoint of the pre-
sentation, enough money was cleared
to wipe out the old debts of the club.
The three performances were well
attended, and the general opinion of
the managers seemed to be that still
greater things are in store for next
year. With the club now free fro-m
debt more expense can be incurred in
future presentation than formerly.

‘The show was a great advertising
proposition for the University as ap-
proximately 1,400 tickets were given
out to High school seniors in this
vicinity. .

Manager A. S. Haines of the. Glee
club presented a ﬁnancial statement
and showed that the club is in sound
-condition. He outlined his plans for
a trip to be taken during the Spring
vacation. One of the towns which has
been ‘deﬁnitely secured is Erie, Pa.

Manager F. A. Moran of the Owl
reported that the preparatory work

was largely completed and that every- -

thing pointed toward successful
publication of the largest annual ever
attempted by the Juniors.

The reports presented to the ad-
visory board were most encouraging,
very actively showing that the year
will be completed with all bills paid.

PETTY THIEVING
-IN STATE HALL.

A pocketbook containing money and
a diamond lavalliere disappeared from
the top of one of the lockers in State
hall where it was placed by a co-ed of
the Junior class. The owner had just
been gone a few moments, but in that
short time the pocketbook was taken.
The pocketbook minus its contents was
‘later found in the basement locker
room.

AUSPIGIOUS OPENING
FURGHEMISAL SUGIETY

C. W. Johnson ’89, chief chemist of
Crucible Steel Company of America,
addressed the Chemical Society at its
inaugural meeting. .

Mr. Johnson is one of the foremost
chemists of the nation and is an
authority on iron and steel analysis.
He spoke on “Laboratory Electric
Furnaces and their Applications.”
The lecture was illustrated by means
of furnaces which Mr. Johnson
brought with him.

R. F. Brennen, president of the so-
ciety gave a brief address in which he
introduced Mr. Johnson and also wel-
comed the alumni.

Since the re’-organization of the
Chemical Society and the admission
of the alumni with its enrollment, the
society has taken great strides for-
'ward. That the new policy has met
with the decided approval of the
alumni is attested by the great num-
ber of letters received from various
alumni expressing their - satisfaction
at the change. A few of the new
alumni are listed as follows:

Wm. A. Hamor, Mellon Institute;
John C. Fetterman, Dean of College;
James Todd, President, Sterling Var-
nish Company; Frederick D. Hawkins,
Crucible Steel Company; Edward C.
Trax, Filtration Plant, McKeesport;
Paul D. Wright, Assistant Furnace
Superintendent, Edgar Thompson

S. Isaacs, DeRoy Motor Car Company;
Emma Lyall Stuart, Kansas City, Mo.;
Wm. G. Haines,. Omaho, Neb.; Harry
E. Walters, United Engineering and

BELLEVUE » VISITED
BY MUSIGAL CLUBS

Playing before a crowded house, the
musical clubs delighted the citizens of
Bellevue last Friday evening when
they appeared under the auspices of
the Yuroka club of that place. Both
the vocal and instrumental selections
were well received with appreciation
and enthusiasm.

This evening, the clubs appear at

Pennsylvania College for Women. This
is the last concert of the winter term
and all the members are urged to be
there.
Final rehearsal for the spring trip
will be held next Tuesday evening and
all who expect to make this trip must
come out.

.The concert tonight is at 8:00 P.

and getting off at Woodland road.

FRESH RUN INTO -
- EGG SHAMPO.

Bombs in the shape of stale eggs
were dropped on a troop of unsuspect-
ing freshmen who assembled to have
their picture taken on the steps of
Thaw hall, at 10:30 o’clock Tuesday
morning. Smoke was furnished by
small paper bags of ﬂour ﬂying from
all directions and bursting on the
clothes of the freshmen.

The Sophomores were to have a
group picture taken at 10:30 o’clock,
ﬁfteen minutes after the taking of
the freshman picture. A few.sopho-
mores made arrangements with the
manager of the Owl for their class to
have its picture taken ﬁrst.

The Freshmen had heard many
rumors concerning a breaking down of
the time honored custom of the Sopho-
mores’ besmearing them with the
likewise time honored eggs, but they
were ‘too ‘zealous to allow the taking
of the physiognomies to interfere with
anything that might happen. The
freshmen lined up on the steps while
the sophomores formed two groups,
one above the freshmen and the other
facing them across the street. All
was quiet and the camera was ready
to click when the eggs and bags of
ﬂour began to ﬂy. Immediately there
was a rush in all directions by the
“freshies.”

They assembled again at a corner
nearby where they were persuaded by
the vigilant Sophs to line up on the
steps of Memorial hall. A few sopho-
mores who still ‘had eggs in reserve
appeared on the balcony directly above
the freshmen, while the remaining
sophomores were counting the “bulls-
eye shots” that they, had left on the
beautifully gowned plebes.

At the first volley of eggs from the
rear, the freshmen beat another hasty
retreat. This time it was not from

The Greek plans for the far famed

for the title by defeating State at
Duquesne Garden last Saturday even-
ing, while Swarthmore won her place
in the race by putting Albright, the
winner of the central title out of the
running.

The teams come together for the
triangular combat backed by available
records. Swarthmore won from Rut-
gers and took a brace of games from
‘Lehigh but lost to Penn State and
Army. The ﬁnaltriwumph of the Pitt
opponents was their victory over Al-
bright on the Lehigh ﬂoor by a score
of 27-25. Pitt has a phenomenal string
of victories to her credit including two
over W. & J., a double triumph over
Tech, besides winning two of 0
games with State who defeated
Swarthmore, and by a victory over
Rutgers by more points than Swarth-
more scored on the same team. On
the other hand both aggregations lost
to the Army squad by something like
the same score, so that it will be that

matched and Pitt will have an enemy
wprthy of her best efforts.

The game which was to‘ have been
played with Marietta this evening has
been canceled by Manager Downing,
and instead the Blue and Gold team
will leave by the ten thirty train for
the ﬁeld of the championship battle.
A most imposing farewell has been
planned for the departing warriors by-
the student body, a large number of
the students having planned to be on
the scene and speed the “Dependable
Eight” on their way to the full swing’
of the Pitt battle cries, and should the
probable happen and the team return
with the trophy, there will be an even
larger crowd at the station to welcome
the victors home.

The trophy which will be tendered
to the winner of this deciding game.
which is to be played in Cooper
Battillion hall, will be in the form of
a gigantic silver loving cup mounted
on a carved ebony base and upu‘&I:

mores who were on the balcony. The
freshmen were soon overpowered by
second year men. After everything
had quieted downand both Fresh and
Sophs were discussing eggs and flour,
more ammunition hit in the crowd,
taking effect on one sophomore. This
time a freshman threw the egg. This
plebe was soon a prisoner in the hands
of his overseers who quickly carried
him to the nearest barber to have his
hair shaved.

During the skirmish at the steps of
Memorial hall, two freshm_en who were \

AT ECONOMICS BANQUET.

Speeches of the real entertaining
variety, the kind that make you want
to hear more instead of boring you
were delivered at the Economics ban-
quet held last Wednesday evening at
the Monongahela‘ house. Everyone
seemed to have the spirit of doing his
best for Pitt and this feeling was re-
ﬂected by the speakers.

Dr. S. B. Linhart gave a few facts
not generally known about the earlier
history of the University. Ray Huff
spoke on the “Ideals” that a Univer-
sity man should have. J . Clare George
gave an interesting talk on “Cutting
Oneself Out Over Again For Present
Duty.” Dr. F. D. Tyson, W. C. Ar-
ther, J. L. Levy, F. A. Moran and
Herman Kline entertained the ban-
queters by witty talks.

BIOLOGY JOB GOES
TO MELLON INSTITUTE.

This year’s large class in general
biology has just completed a full term
of laboratory work in the Carnegie
Museum. This was an innovation
necessitated by the lack of room in
the State hall laboratories. The
course included axstudy of represnta-

telling the story of evolution which
was the subject of the term’s work..
- The class will resume its“ regular

work next term in the labmhzsml

cup will be engraved the result of the
decisive game.

The fortunes of the Universit will
be in safe hands as far as the 0 cials
are concerned. Tom Thorpe, of
Columbia wired his acceptance of the
referee position while the umpireship
-will be looked after by Taggert of
Harrisburg. Taggert worked here in
the game which gave Pitt 1:ire‘Wil.suu1

will form the best bet securable in
the line of arbiters for the game
played in the Quaker City tomorrow
evening.

S With the close of the present term,
‘a question which naturaly agitates the
;mind of every student taking biology
iis that of the disposition for next
iterm. During the past three months,
ithe students have been sent to Car-

.Yet each one has been assessd three
dollars and ﬁfty cents for the rent of
this institution whose banners have
ever borne the proud boast “free to

be sent that far for such work, with-
out the added advantage of being
charged for the privilege. Under such
conditions, whatever may be the ar-

the University wishes to avoid the
appearance of graft, it owes a refund

FRESHMAN GIRL.

Editor PITT WEEKLY:

We were delighted to read your ex-
cellent editorial recently, entitled
“Are We Socialists?” We wish to
congratulate you for. the fairness and
squareness displayed in the lines.

Unfortunately, prejudice, intoler-
ance and norrow-mindedness has not
altogether. disappeared, even from
college men. That the stand taken by
the WEEKLY is a most fair one, and
ithat it will be praised by every “Pitt”
;man, we do not doubt. The university
is to be congratulated for its progres-
ssiveness and tolerance to all.

For the beneﬁt of the person who

. Times, wrote the letter referred to in the
8:00 p. m,—Basketba11, Pitt vs, editorial, _we.wish to state that our
t Swarthmore, Weightman hall, organization is not for the purpose of

CONQUERORS.

Not amidst the wild enthusiasm of
the football ﬁeld, although lots of
spirit of the indoor variety was shown,
but with the support of a majority of
the students and the good will of all,
the basketball men have again seized
the .Western Pennsylvania champion-
ship and will tomorrow night meet

, Swarthmore on Penn’s ﬂoor to decide -
I the‘ state supremacy.

.We can understand the sense of
elation _:which the football man feels
wh’én‘?the"cheers of thousands laud his

« good work on the ﬁeld and make him

forget the gruelling training which he
has endured to make the victory pos-
sible, but the basketball men, receiv-
ing much less recognition_ for their
work, have played their best through-
out the season and by the result of

, their work they merit the applause-

and commendation -of every student of
the; -«_,.-tUniver'sity.

Tonight, they will have few support-
ers present to cheer them as they give
battle to the ‘eastern champions. They
are out to win as they have been all
year, and the student can feel sure

, that if Swarthmore ‘wins it will be be-

cause the best work of our men was
not good enough, for Coach Flint
never allows them to play anything
but their best. Since we cannot be
there to cheer them as they play, let
us» be prepared to give them a real
reception on their return whether they
win or lose. Some real recognition of
the work these menhave been doing
is long over-due and we trust that the
Board of Control will ﬁnd a suitable
method of demonstrating the students
approval of the team's work.

THE VVARSITY LETTER CLUB.

We are now ready to proceed with
the organization of the “Varsity
Letter Club,” which has been referred
to quite frequently in THE WEEKLY
Alumni columns. The idea in giving
out these advance notices was to see
what the letter men really thought of
the scheme and get them talking
about it. We are glad to state that
all who have spoken to the Secretary
about it—and quite a few have-are
greatly interested and have promised
their unlimited support. ’

The organization meeting will be
held in the Trees gymnaisum, Friday
evening, March 19th, at 8 o’clock.
Director of Athletics, C. S. Miller has
turned over the entire gym for the
evening and the whole place from the
swimming pool to the wrestling room
will be available. All graduates or
undergraduates who have been award-
edxthe varsity insignia in any branch
of athletics are eligible for member-
ship in the club. This includes foot-
ball, baseball, basketball, track, wrestl-
ing, fencing, swimming, hockey, tennis
or any other varsity sport. Thisweek,
notices have been sent to‘ 11 men of
whom we have record. Th list covers
chieﬂy the men who won their letters
since 1904 as the record previous to
that time is very inaccurate. We have
written some of the men who are
familiar with the list of letter men of
“the olden times” and will get letters
to all we hear of. Any men who don’t
get a notice and who are “letter men”
s_houldn’t feel slighted, but are asked
to write the secretary immediately.

The plan for the evening is some-
thing like this: ‘ ‘

We will, as stated, have the entire
gym at our disposal. We will have at
least one high—class boxing bout be-
tween two of the best amateur boxers
in, Western Pennsylvania. This will
be the only event in which oiutsiders
will compete. We will have a wrestl-
ing bout between members of the Pitt
team. ‘One of the contestants will
likely be “Jimmy” Jones, the football
player, who gave Yerger, of State,

. "such a battle in the recent Pitt-State

dual meet. We will have several
swimming exhibitions in the gym pool.
All the varsity captains and managers
will be there, so the letter men can
meet them, if they haven’t had the
pleasure up to this time. « Some of the
“Old” Guard will tell a few stories
and we will formally organize the
club.

There will be some ﬁne eats served
by Hunter Johnston and “Dory” Moore,
the poetic cook of the football camp
and track house. Hunter and “Dory”.
are now running a co-operatice board-
ing house in the track house and they
have been secured to serve sandwiches,
salad, ice cream,~cofl"e and a few other
dainties that evening. A good piano
player will be engaged to enliven the
occasion.

The night of the meeting we will
decide on some suitable lapel buttan
for the members of the club. The
secretary will have several designs to
submit. It will probably be of the
University colors with the small “P”.
This is something that every letter-
man will be glad to wear on his coat:)
If any one‘ has suggestions which“
will help along the affair, write the
secretary. Talk it up to every letter
man yo meet. *

In order to take care of the eats,
music, medals and other incidental
expenses, the tax will be $1.00 per man
for graduates and 50 cents for under-
graduates. We are making this differ-
ence in the rate in order that the men
who are now in school, many of whom
aren’t supplied with an abundance of
this world’s goods may be able to take
advantage of membership in the club.
We want them in and we don’t want
to keep them away on account of lack

of ﬁnances. Almost anyone canscrape
up 50 cents for an affair of this kind
and that is why we are making them
that rate. We feel sure -that the
letter men who are‘ graduates and who
have a regular income will appreciate
the justice of this.

Won’t you help boost this club? It
is something we have long needed,
Penn State has a similar organization
and Alumni Secretary_ and Graduate
Manager Ray H. Smith advises the
Secretary that it is the livest organi-
zation they have.

GATHERING OF MUSICAL
CLUBS “OLD GUARD.”

Arrangements have been made for
a reunion of the “Old Guard” who are
members of the Glee, Banjo and
Mandolin clubs of the early 90’s, the
affair to be held Thursday, March 18,
at 7 o’clock at the University Club.
It will be an informal affair and the
notices instruct each man “to bring
his stomach and vocal organs.” Harry
S. Calvert, H. M. Laughlin and John L.
High are the committee in charge.
Mr. High will be remembered as a
former director of the University
Musical Clubs. Notices have been
sent to a-list of about 75 men who

were prominent in these University‘

activities during those years. It is
expected that there will be a big turn
out and that it will be one of the
best alumni “get-together” affairs
held for some time. '

,Y. M. c. A.

Election of officers featured a very
interesting business meeting which
constituted the weekly session of the
Y. M. C. A. in Thaw hall, last Mon-
day morning. The meeting was char-
acterized not so much by the number
present as by the enthusiasm mani-
fested. Geo. O. Reemsnyder spoke on
the great task which is confronting
the organization and the many difficul-
ties which it must overcome before it
takes _its proper place in the student
life of the University. V

A very spirited and enthusiastic
discussion was held on the advisabil-
ity of holding the Annual Conference
of State Y. M. C. A. Presidents at
Pitt. Everyone present agreed that
this conference would do much toward
stimulating interest in the Y. M. C. A.
work at the University, but the great-
est obstacle confronting the associa-
tion is the proper housing of the dele-
gates. In as much as this conference
has been offered the local organiza-
tion, it is to be hoped that the hous-
ing committee can settle the problem
satisfactorily '

The following officers were elected
for the ensuing year: J. D. Stark, Col.
'16, president; C. W. Pollock, Mines
’18, vice president; Geo. Rizner,.- Col.
’17, secretary; Logan Hall, Col. ’18,
treasurer.

DEBATER INJURED.

Injuries received as the result of a

fall on or near the steps leading up to
the Gymnasium may keep W. C. Ar-
thur, Econ. ’18, from participating in
the debate at Wooster tonight.
’ The only ones who saw the accident
_were two men not connected with the
University who, meeting Director Mil-
lei? a few moments later, informed him
of the accident and told him that they
thought the boy was hurt more than
he realized. Mr. Miller overtook Ar-
thur, who was then staggering down
the road. Arthur recognized Mr.
Miller but did not remember having
fallen. .

He was taken to State hall and a
physician called; he was found to be
suffering from a fractured shoulder.

PITT SHADES A
PENN STATE
3 BY EYE [ASH

From start to ﬁnish -the Pitt-State
League Championship gam e was
the fastest played in Pittburgh this
year—-or, may we hvumbly venture, at
any other time or place. There was
at no time anything remotely resem-
bling a lull in the battle, nor were
there at any moment less than ten
men actively engaged. State _P13«Y9d
a game that deserved to win any
championship, and Pitt was a triﬂe
better. We deserved to win by four

The score was tied six times; State
lead throughout a large part of the
ﬁrst and a good deal of the second
half. At one point the vistors held a
four point. lead, and once our team
was six points to the good; these were
the high water marks on each side.
There was never a time when a sup-
porter of either team could feel any-
thing like sure as to the outcome.

The ﬁrst half was marked by good
foul shooting, particularly by Park,
and by some remarkably fast and ac-
curate passing, but its chief feature
was the excellent guarding of both
teams. The score was very close
throughorut, State taking the lead _late
in the half by three or four points,
which was cut down to one by the ﬁn-
ish; a basket by Matson Just after the

the edge had it come a second sooner.
Jester made a spectacular play when

near the basket. and Hastings made
another impossible shot.

The second half started even ‘faster,
and increased steadily in speed, until
at times it was practically impossible
for the spectator to follow the ball.;
during this -period State showe gen-
erally better team play, which .-was
overcome by some remarkable indi-
vidual.” work on the part of Lubic,
Hastings and Ochsenhirt, and an oc-
casional -bit of passing that was too
good even for State’s stonewall de-
fence. Lubic’s foul shootingun this
period was almost perfect, while Park
slumped a little. Pitt took the lead
on two baskets by Matson, some ﬁne
foul shooting and a great shot _ by
Hastings. “Benny” had_to take time
out to get his face repaired, after an
especially vigorous scrimmage, but
came back stronger than ever. With
two minutes to play, and the score
37-33, Park got two fouls and gave
State a chance to take the game into
an extra period-—but their next at-
te t was frustrated; Lubic got the
ball, dribbled down the sideline and,
with two or three State men leap-
ing in at him, made a marvelous shot
that cinched the game for Pitt. Five
seconds later the whistle blew.

When every participant in the game
deserves the highest praise, it is hard
to name individual stars. However,
the two men who did more than any
others to bring glory to the Gold and
Blue were Lubic and Hastings. The
former played the ﬁnest all-round

seen here in years, and “Andy” was
almost equally brilliant, two of his
four goals being made under remark-
able conditions. These two and Cap-
tain “Butch” distinguished themselves

few opportunities to shoot, but was
prominent in much of the teamwork.

Jester and Wilson of State played
splendid basketball, while Walton was
very strong on the defense; the State
forwards worked hard, but were out-
played by the local guards. There
were no substitutions on either side,
despite the speed and consequent
roughness of the game. The lineup:

WEARERS or PLAID
DEFEAT FRESHMEN.

i

The Pitt Freshmen went down to

Tech Plebes, by the narrow margin‘ of
two points, last Friday night, before
the Varsity show. The result was a
surprise, for the ﬁrst year men easily
defeated the Tech men earlier in the
season. For. some reason the Pitt
boys could not get their old time team
work A going and that more than any-

thing else spelled defeat for them. 1

Seater of the Plebes led the ﬁeld in
both goals, from ﬁeld, and goals from
the foul line. He caged the ball ﬁve
times from the ﬁeled and registered 17
times out of possible 22 from the foul
line. Nicolas registered four ﬁeld
goals, but Davis with two baskets and
13 fouls lead his team in number of
points scored. The game was nip and
tuck throughout but the Plaid men
pulled ahead in the last half and

4 time.

LOOKING ’EM OVER

We tender our sympathy to the Com-
mander-in-chief of theisporting sheet
who is conﬁned to his home by a
severe cold, aided and abetted by mum-
erous examples of that form of en-
tertainment that made Job so popular
with himself. Meanwhile this page is
attempting to struggle into form
through the well intended efforts of a
Printer’s Devil, a Negative Debator,
and a Sorrowing Relative.

Champion Basketball team — Ben
Lubic.

The State people need not become
too profuse in their self-congratula-
tions on the Wrestling victory over
the Pitt grapplers until they take a
quiet retrospect of the‘ Blue and Gold
triumphs in football and basketball.

___o._D _

Cheer up, it might have been worse.

Jones might have been thrown.

.——-o-—-

In the midst‘ of all the jubilations
don’t forget that it was a mighty hard
one for State‘ to lose too. No losing
team ever played a better game than
they and was more deserving of the
sympathy due a game sportsmanlike
bunch.

All of which serves to remind us
that had the allied ﬂeet started on
their drive up the‘ Dardenelles with
anything like the irresistable force
that featured Hastings’ last dribble
up the ﬂoor, the capture of Constanti-
nople would have been ancient history
by this time.

With the passing of the State meet
closed the contract of the University
athletic authorities with Coach Rein-
ecke of the Wrestling squad. He was
a clean cut, fair-minded man who
made his every acquaintance a friend
and it is with a great deal of regret on
the part of the Wrestling squad as
well as his other,friends about the
University that the able assistance of
this skilled at man will not be avail-
able to the itt grapplers in the fut-
ure.

Tom McCollough steadfastly avers
that ‘he won the big game by “rolling”
a wad of tinfoil every time a basket
was needed. This lucky piece is being

reputation it is to be set in gold and

PIT'I‘ GRAPPLERS SNOWED -
UNDER BY STATE TEAM.
The Curfew tolled the knell of part-
ing day and far nip in the wilds of
Center county, the Pitt wrestling
squad of seven weeks experience
ended their short season in the gloom
of a 34-0 defeat. With the exception
of one or two of the men all the Blue
and Gold grapplers were new men
with no experience on the mat" except
the brief allotment of time they had
spent under the able tutorship of
Coach Reinecke and considering that
it was but the second set meet that
some of the men have ever been enter-
ed, the showing made was not so bad.
Jimmie Jones put up the ﬁnest battle
of any of the Pitt aggregation and
was only beaten by a decision. Capt.
Collins stayed with his man longer
than any other Pitt man except Jones
but was ﬁnally beaten. by the super-

ior experience and knowledge of his .

State opponent. The suprise of the
meet was Reilly’s match. The gritty
little Irishman stuck gamely to his
more experienced opponent and when
he succeeded in securing the crotch
hold every one thought he had the
match cinched but the agile Blue and
White grappler managed to wriggle
out of the clinch and land the Pitt
representative. Sutherlan had Lamb
worried for several minutes before the
meet and when they took the mat the
State man fought cautiously for some
Finally Sutherlan overbalanced
himself in an attempt to kick out his
opponent’s feet and went to the ﬂoor
in a clinch. Lamb quickly hammer-
locked “Jock’s” bad arm and succeed-
eddin touching his shoulders to the
pa .

In the character of a Pitt-satisfy-
ing prelude to the triumphal burst of
Saturday night came thelow ringing
notes of the Blue and Gold victory
over our Schenley Park neighbors, to
the tune of 47-30. The result of the
game was highly gratifying to the
University men but at the same time
a distinct shock to the Tech adherents
for they had been in high hopes of
evening matters with Pitt with the
team which had been showing such

exceptional form in the last few
games. '

The ﬁrst section of the contest was
by far the better of the game from
the spectator’s point of view. Pitt
worked hard but the opposition fought
gamely and. succeeded in keeping the
score within the margin of 23-16 in
the favor of the Blue and Gold quin-
tet. The second half was nothing but
Pitt from the opening to the ﬁnish
whistle shrilled. its knell to the Tech
men. The speed and aggressiveness
of the University men increased as
the game progressed Iuntilit was a
runaway. “As usual Ben Lubic feat-
ured in his foul shooting--coming
across with the remarkable string of
twenty consecutive baskets and a
grand total of twenty-three out of
twenty-seven. Levy, of the opposi-
tion, kept as close as it is possible
for man to keep behind Lubic at the
foul line but was unable to equal
the enviable work of the Pitt man.
Hastings was on the job and featured
by tossing a basket from the center
of the ﬂoor. Matson, Healy, Graham,
McCollough, and Carlson showed up
well while Capt. Ochsenhirt played his
usual dependably brilliantsgame.

FRESHMEN GIRLS I '
’ WON TVVO GAMES.

The girls basketball team of the
University made their ﬁrst; appear-
ance in the outside ﬁeld of sport in a
blaze of glorious success. The ﬁrst
outside game which they played was
with the girl representation of the
South High School in which the Pitt
co-eds proved themselves to be the
victors. The second contest was lost
to the Fifth Avenue girls by a “Le-
high’ score, but the Blue and Gold
Girls came back splendidly in the next
game and defeated the Crafton ladies
in a hard fought contest. The games
were featured by the excellent work
of Miss Vohr and exceptional foul
shooting by Miss Wehmeier. ‘

We solicit your kind patronage ;

tered P in the inter-collegiate indoor  If

meet which is being conducted by the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association at the
Duquesne Garden tomorrow evening.

.The Blue and Gold men will enter
the meet, with somewhat more of a
handicap than last year. In the one
mile relay“’e'vent Pitt will be especial-
ly at odds. Last season this feature
event was captured by the Blue and
Gold men through the excellent work
of Capt. Marshall. With the peer of
the nunning game out ‘of consideration
the chances of winning this section of
the meet seems a triﬂe less rosy this
year, but there are some good men
amoung the new comers and the ﬁnal
result should smack more of the gold-
en tinge than of the blueish hue, de-
spite the fact that they will be pitted
against some of the most renowned
track men of the country’.

One branch of the sport that seems
especially well provided for in the new
material is the quarter mile depart-

men have been unable to get into con-
dition for this meet. It is highly prob-
able that Coach Kerr will place a
great dealof conﬁdence in the super-
ability of Burwell. This man paces
off an unusualy fast 440 and may be
depended upon in the relay as well.
In addition to the special feature the
Pitt authorities have entered men in
all the regular events of the Middle
Atlantic Meet, which are to be staged
upon the same evening.

Despite the fact that the schedule
is the most difﬁcultthat has yet been
presented to a University track ag-
gregation the outlook for ultimate
success seems to have increased in
even greater proportion than the dif-
ﬁculty of the schedule.

The following men are the entries
that have been made by Pitt for the
P. A. A. meet: '

yds.; McMasters, 60 yd. dash, MAC,

FRESHMEN WIN ANOTHER.

Still in the slump that .has charac-
terized their play in the last few
games the Freshmen travelled to Cor-
aopolis . Saturday night and barely
won out over a team that they ever-
whelmed earlier in the season.
ﬁrst half ended with the high school
boys in the lead with a two point
margin. The Freshmen took on a
new lease of life in the second half
and by showing some of their old
time form. succeeded in ﬁnally catch-

ing up and then nosing out by a four ’

point lead. .Harper, shooting the fouls
for Coraopolis, caged 18 out of 25
chances.

Tomorrow night the Freshmen meet
Charleroi at Charleroi. The game
previously scheduled with Allegheny
high for tonight has been canceled
and no game will be played between
these two teams this season.

BEAVER COUNTY ALUMNI
AND STUDENTS ORGANIZE.

The third county Pitt club was
successfully organized last Friday
evening when about forty-ﬁve under-
graduates, and alumni of the Univers-
ity residing in Beaver County, met in
the Tamaqua club, Beaver Falls, to
launch the Beaver County Pitt cllub.
Despite miserable weather conditions,
the gathering was bubbling over with
Pitt enthusiasm, and the results were
more than gratifying to the members
of the organization committee,
through whose efforts the meeting
had been arranged. A satisfying
menu was served by the ladies of the
Wesley socitey of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, and the social
features of theioccasion, enhanced by
the congenial atmosphere of the club
house, and the Pitt songs and yells,
were complete.

On the speakers’ list were Karl E.

The next attraction gazetted for the Davis
Theater beginning Monday, March 15th, with
the usual matinee, will be “Broadway Jones,”
written by George M. Cohan, recognized as
one of the.most versatile of theyounger play-
wrightsrand actors. Mr. Cohan not only wrote
the play but staged it, and played the lead-‘
ing character in it for three seasons. This

that time, he presented a paper for

marks concerning the sophomores and
their actions. The other freshman
similarly decorated made the same re-
mark that since it was a school custom
there was no use in getting sore, the
best thing to do was to take it good
naturedly. These remarks. led the
plebes to combat between themselves.
Sophomores soon stopped the battle,
declaring that it was the freshmens’
place to ﬁght the sophomores and not
to discuss freshman spirit among
themselves as neither of them was at
that time upholding it. '

After an agitation which lasted un-
til noon, the number of victims gradu-
ally diminished. The weary, but wiser
freshies‘ dispersed without having had
their pictures taken. They retired to
weep in secret and to cleanse their
golden colored clothes.

has pledged itself to this enterprise,
in emulation of Old Penn, State and
other institutions which support mis-
sionary ‘work in various ﬁelds. The
project. is one. whose value none can
deny, since it is a question not of sec-
tarian religion, but of giving the
young men of China the same oppor-

by ‘Dr. David R. Breed on “The Chris-

ing with the tree of life in Genesis,
the speaker showed the Bible as a
unit and ended with the tree of life in
Revelations. He also treated its great
lesson that salvation from sin is pos-
sible. , .
“Experience has proved that if read

strength, faith and courage,” said Dr.
Breed. --
