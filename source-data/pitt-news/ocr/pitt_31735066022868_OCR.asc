$10.5 Million Student UnionRenovation‘P|ons Cut$2.5 Mil,

By NOLA WERNER
Pitt News Staff Writer,

The $10.5 million Student Union
renovation plan projected to‘ start
this summer has been dropped in
favor of an $8 million plan pro-

' jected for next summer.

The original plan, which included
a restaurant, handball courts, and a
health spa, “was a Taj Mahal effort
with the best ‘ of everything,”
according to Andy Smith, director
of the Office of Student Activities.

However, it required the con-
struction of additional buildings
and was determined to be “beyond
feasibility,” according to Smith.

' Thelnew $8 million plan was »

“based on the availability of
funds,” and will contain “most of
the original plan without the res-
taurant and athletic facilities,” ac-
cording to Jack Freeman, the senior
vice chancellor for administration.

subjects. Pitt News staff writer and

What kind ofxbudgﬂet crisis is Pitt in

Pitt’s Board of Trustees Monday, ~

July 7, voted to hike annual tuition
for Oakland undergraduates by
$200, a 12 percent increase effective
in the fall 1980 academic term.
Governor, Thornburgh is ex-
pected to sign Pitt’s appropriation

fund. However, the balance will be .

paid by the students by way of a
student union fee or through an in-
crease in tuition, Freeman explain-

“It is most regretable that we
face fiscal uncertainty over an
unresolved legislative issue that has
no direct relevance whatever to
higher education. ' As of now, we
have no reasonable alternative " to
acting upon a budget based on state
fundings at levels recommended by
the governor and passed by a nearly
unanimous vote by the General
Assembly. We must rely» on the
leadership of_ this state, both ex-
ecutive and legislative, and we will
work with them in any way we can.
Should there be ‘a cut in funding,
obviously «we ‘would have to read-

over a "relatively minor revenue bill
pertaining to license fees and there’s
disagreement between  the ad-
ministration and the General
Assembly over (the bill). But it has

_now become tangled up with the

non-preferred funding, and if this
whole thing collapses over. that
agreement, the governor's office
may. resort to something called
abatement. Which would be cutting
five.percent out of our appropria-

tions, which is three-and-a-half
‘ million dollars.

Will there be a tuition hike?

Yes, in fact the board meeting to-
day announced that.

Freeman estimated that a student ‘

union fee would be an average of
$30 to $35 a term, “_but the final
cost depends on a lot of factors that
we can’t determine at this time.”

Posvar, Pitt’s chancellor.

The $254.6 million operating
budget was approved on the
assumption that Pitt will receive a
state appropriation of $71.069
million, a 5.2 percent increase over

last year which is well below the rate ‘

of inflation.

“The tuition increases are man-
dated, in order to sustain the quali-
ty of our academic programs, meet
our salary and other obligations,
and still maintain a balanced
budget,” Posvar said.

In addition, the budget for fiscal
year 1980/81 includes an added
$11.1 million for compensation or
salary increases for faculty and
staff,’ for a total of $113 million.

Instead of hiking tuition, isn’t there
someway to cut some services to
keep tuition at the level it’s at?

Well, we have out three to four

compensation has gone up less than

gone up four, five, or six percent a

  Proposal .

By NANCY E. WORK
Pitt News Staff Writer

_ Students may face higher loan
costs if the bill to curtail federal in-
terest subsidies, recently adopted by
the Senate 56 to 41, passes in the
joint House-Senate conference
committee. "

The proposal, marking a majifi
policy change in student aid, was in-
.troduced by‘ Sen. Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. The amend-
ment is part of an omnibus bill ex-
tending the college aid program for
the.next- five years.

“At present, the government has
not required students to repay in-

terest on loans. The only change
that will occur under this amend-
ment ‘is that students will be re-
quired to repay that portion of the
loan at a rate of nine percent upon
graduation,” said an aide to
Metzembaum. ‘

A student borrowing $4,000 pays
$51.00 a month in principal and
interest over a ten-year period. The
new rate would be $57.00 a month,
with the $6.00 increase going back
to the Federal government, accor-
ding to -Metzembaum’s aide. .

“Students who are found to be
extremely needy by college loan of-
fices will be exempt from the loan

Draft Registration in July;
Local Counseling Available

By NICHOLAS PETESCH
Pitt News Staff Writer
There will be no draft cards this
year, but four million young men
born in the years 1960 and 1961 will

be expected to register at 34,000_

local post offices. Registration will
take place beginning in July and en-
ding August 2. _

The penalty for noncompliance is
up to five years in prison and a
$10,000 ﬁne. Driver's licenses, high
school graduation records, and
maybe even a repeal of the Privacy
Act are expected to be used to
locate the predicted 500,0()0 non-
registrants (10 to 12 percent).

The $13.3 million registration bill
was previously not expected to be
passed or considered this year, but
was quickly legislated last week.

Milani To Advise SGB
Allocations Committee

Terry Milani, associate director
of student activities will be assum-

. ing the responsibility of advising the

Student Government Board Alloca-
tions Committee, according to An-
dy Smith, director of student ac-
tivities. '

Advising the allocations commit-
tee was originally under the juris-
diction of Smith, but with progress
advancing on the Student Union
renovations plans, Smith said it was
“necessary for me to spend more
time” with the renovations plans.

“I had to rearrange some of my
time,” Smith said, ‘.,‘lt’s completely
appropriate that he (Milani) advise
them; this is a kind of down
season.”

According to Smith, the Office of
Student Activities has been the
“ones who have done all the pro-
gram proposals” relating to renova-
tions. '

“We are the managers of the
building,” Smith added.

 
   

BALLOONS‘

The timing of Carter's registration
bill surprised many voters, coming
during an election year", reviving the
anti-war sentiment that had been
prevalent during the Viet Nam era.
According to Tom Onieal, coor-
dinator of the local Committee
Against Registration and the Draft
(CARD), “Peace time registration
does not signiﬁcantly enhance our
ability to mobilize forces, but is
merely a charade to make the
President look like a strong decisive
leader during an election year.”
CARD is a nationwide organiza-
tion headed in Washington by the
Rev. Barry Lynn and started in
February of 1979. The Pittsburgh
chapter consists of 500 people from
the area. CARD is equipped to do
draft counseling for draft age
young men--those 18-26. The
counseling will be available at a
two-day workshop July 11-12,
featuring guest speaker, Jon Lan-

dau, staff attorney with the Central ,

Committee for Conscientious Ob-
jection. The July ll session will be
held Friday at 8:00 in the Venetian
room of the Student Union.

CARD is currently preparing for
a registration week campaign at the
post offices. “We’re not registering
people , for a ping-pong
tournament,” Onieal said.

Willard Meade of the Friends
Peace Center, a Quaker Religious
organization, considers registration
“a fairly’ political move that’s
bound to backfire.”

“Every registration has led to a
draft,” Mead added.

The center opened in the early
60's and provides draft counseling.‘

Joe Hughs of the Thomas Mer-
ton Center offered an interpretation
of registration as “an attempt to
revive American ma'cho
sentiment.” The Thomas Merton
Center, along with CARD, ‘provides
draft counseling. Draft counseling
will also be available at the Du-
quesne ministry. ’

charges. No one would be required
to repay the interest subsidy on
more than the first $7,500 in bor-
rowed funds, thus avoiding too
steep a repayment burden for the
long term graduate student.

“Furthermore, these charges wil
not be retroactive. Students will
only be affected on any new loans
they borrow after October 1,
198l,” Metzenbaum’s aide in-
dicated. . 7

Daniel C. May, Pitt’s associate
director of student aid operation,
said the intent of this bill is to put
needed reforms into the current
program.

May Raise Student Loan Interest Rates By 1981

“What has happened is that
federally subsidized loans have
become loans of convenience rather
than one of need. Originally, finan-
cial aid was intended for families
whose income was $25,000 or less,”

May said.
Should this proposal be passed it
will be an “administrative

nightmare” for the financial aid
department, according to May. An
additional 7,500 applications will
have to be processed in order to
determine those need-based
students, Currently there are be-
tween 10,000 and 11,000 students at
Pitt who have need-based loans.

,/

Now there are 5,200 students
receiving state graranteed loans at
an estimated 8.7 million‘ dollars;
2264 graduate students receiving 7.1
million dollars, for a combined
total of about 16 million dollars.

May predicted that this proposal
would not pass in the House-Senate
conference committee. “Rather,”
he said, “another means of solving
the problem will be found.

“One way of solving the problem
is that the government would go
back to determining student
eligibility by having an income
cutoff,” May said.

‘Co-op Faces Possibleshult-down

By SETH H. LUBOVE

Pitt News Staff Writer

The student-run food co-op at
Pitt, in the wake of a $1,793 deficit
for last year, may cease operations
next fall according to Student
Government Board president Bill
Abraham.

According to Abraham, it will
cost SGB $7,793 to put the co-op
“back on its feet.” Since the co-op
is a standing committee of SGB, the
board has the “authority to estab-
lish and direct as well as terminate
all Standing Committees,” as stated
in the SGB constitution. ‘

While the co-op was originally set
up in the spring of 1976 under the
premise of offering students low
food prices and a chance to manage
a business, Abraham cites student
mismanagement as one of the
primary factors in the large. deficit
accumulated this year. _

year, there was terrible mismanage-
ment of the place, or it ran into
abuse,” Abraham said. ,
“Playing around with trying to
operate a business wasn't worth
that kind of money,” Abraham ad-

ded. _ A
Although Abraham conceded it

was not necessary “to make a profit
on the food co-op,” he was still
concerned about absorbing $8,000
losses “year after year.”

As an alternative to a complete
shut-down of the co-op, SGB
members discussed the possibility
of hiring a graduate student in the
School of Business to supervise the
operations of the co-op.

Director of Student Activities
Andy Smith said the idea of a co-op
is “pretty good,” but it takes
“quite an effort to run and
operate.” .

‘_‘It’s a business, and when SGB
gets involved in operating a

According to Smith, SGB has to

Although the idea of tuition in-
creases for students and salary in-
creases for faculty and staff seems a
bit unfair to many students, Yeager
said the premise is a “very simple
one.”

in

“Inflation impacts everybody in-
cluding the faculty and staff here at
the university,” Yeager said.
“University salaries have lagged

behind the rate of inflation in recent
years.”

Yeager also said he felt Pitt’s
staff and faculty should have “at
least some opportunity to keep up
with inflation as well as other peo-
ple,” and he cited the higher rates
of salary increases at Penn State last
year as a comparison.

Proposed tuition rates for full-
time in-state ‘ undergraduate
students on the Oakland campus
will be $1,790. Engineering stu-

dents will pay $1,970. Students in
the Schools of Pharmacy and Nurs-
ing will pay $2,170; Health Related

Would Have Added One Percent To Pitt's Appropriations

State Representative Ron Goebel
said that the failure of the House of
Representatives to approve his
amendment, increasing the ap-
propriations for Pitt, will result in
tuition increases and layoffs.

The Allegheny Democrat explain-

dating an additional $700,000

appropriations of $63 million. Pitt

accordingto Goebel. Even with
Goebel’s proposed increase, it
would only add an additional one

  Investments ' A

_ Investing in an education at the University of Pitt-
sburgh is like investing in silver or gold—-all three
have skyrocketed in price over the past few years. But
‘while gold ‘and, silver have increased in value, one
cannot make the same assessment of a Pitt educa-
, tion.

During the fall and winter terms of 1977-78, tui-
tion was $655 per term for in-state CAS undergrads.

. school year, and all those “little” increases in tuition
since their freshman year, represents $910 worth of
tuition increases during their four-year stay at Pitt.

Now, one may say these increases are due to that
same painful word—inflation, which has the whole
country in its grips, but that is a rather simplistic and
inaccurate source ‘of blame.

The Administration said it best when they pointed
the,finger at state appropriations which do not rate
higher education as a “high priority.” The reasoning
is correct, but those same administrators should have
been standing in front of a mirror reciting the same
words, with their fingers pointing straight ahead.

It is about time faculty members received an in-
crease in pay; it is about time a faculty position at
Pitt should attract valuable new faculty to Pitt. But _‘
what about the faculty members the University has
lost because of the deficits in those same areas over

,By LARRY LUNSFORD

There is a new movement by
several colleges and universities,

. particularly in the northeast, to

force fraternities and sororities to
integrate sexually. This new em-

’ phasis placed on coed fraternities is

wrong, and '1 fully support the na-
tional fraternities and sororities as
they were founded and respect their
-individual aspirations to remain
single-sex entities.

. No, I do not agree that it should
be up to each college or university
to decide whether or not its frater-
nities and sororities should in-
tegrate sexually. There is much
tradition we protect by allowing the
nationals to maintain their respec-
tive autonomies, and the same
rights and privileges are applicable
to those local fraternities and
, sororities which desire to remain
single-sex organizations. If just one
college or university campus is

allowed to order its Greek system to
integrate sexually, then two-
hundred years of respected’ tradi-
tion is lost.
Yes, I believe in change and
freedom of choice, but there are so
few traditions of long-standing that
this one—the nationals’ right to_
maintain‘ their respective
heritages—is one that I adamantly
support.”

In support of my argument, I
note a June 19, 1974, ruling by
Caspar Weinberger, then Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare,
(HEW) headed “Title IX-
Prohibition of Sex Discrimina-
tion." It is an added section to the
Education Amendments of 1972.
These Amendments revise a number
of existing Acts, including the
Higher Education Act of 1965.
However, Section 804 (b) of the
Higher Education Act of 1965 is un-
changed and remains in force. It

the past few years? Pitt is merely owning up to its
obligation to those faculty members that have stuck
it out for so long, and any new faculty members that
are attracted to Pitt will be replacements for the ones
the University has lost. Where has the va1ue.increas-

And what about the students who have to make up

the difference? The administration offers the fact
that there are so many millions available in aid. But,
while tuition is being increased by 12.7%, there is on- -
ly a 4.6% increase in fellowships and scholarships to
offset that increase. _
The University of Pittsburgh administration
should look at themselves and the budget they have
‘ drawn up to see whether they have put the emphasis
on education or whether other areas of the ‘Titt Cor-
poration” are draining the funds available for main-
‘ taining academic quality.

‘Nothing in this Act or any other
Act shall be construed to authorize
any department, agency, officer, or
employee of the United States to
exercise any direction, supervision,
or control over the membership
practices or internal operations of

private sources and whose facilities

Following the enactment of the
Education Amendments of 1972, it
became the responsibility of the
Secretary of .HEW to develop
regulations to implement the Act.
These were the regulations which
Weinberger issued June 19, 1974,
when they were published in the
Federal Register. While the word
“fraternity” is not included, stu-
dent organizations are\included and

discussed. ’ It was agreed in Con-
gress, however, that_ the Waggoner
Amendment to the Higher Educa-
tion Act of 1965 not only applies
but that it protects the interests of
fraternities and sororities in this
issue. ~ ‘

Abolishment of fraternities on

campus has been recommended by _

a Dartmouth College faculty com-
mittee, unless women are allowedtto
live in fraternity houses. The com-

.mittee’s report called. fraternities

“bastions of white male
dominance” which control under-
graduate social life. The report said
fraternities and sororities should ac-
cept members of the opposite sex
and step up minority recruitment.

Fraternities will also have to go
coed if they are to stay at Amherst
College. That's the ultimatum
handed down last March by the col-
lege’s board of trustees. At least
five women must reside in a frater-

 Letter/Dorm Resident Relocated Against Will

(Editor’s note.‘ Copies of the
following letter were submitted-on
July 2, 1980, to Ms. Jo Ann M.
Woodson, Director, Office’ of

- Residence Life, Dr. Wesley Posvar,

Chancellor, the two Pittsburgh

‘newspapers, and other important
administrators within and without
the university).

Dear Ms. Woodson: ‘

I received your letter of June 25,
1980, and I am very displeased with
your decision to change my room
assignment from room 857 and to
give that room to a newly hired area
coordinator. I realize you wanted
to hire a professional, but it is quite
unfair to offer her living accom-
modations at my expense. Being
thrown out of my room for an area
coordinator makes we wonder who

is ‘more important to the university, -

students, or professionals. Obvious-
? Iv.

 

and to. my dismayhprofessionals.

On January 22, 1980, I received a
letter from Donovan Hughes,
Director of- the University Housing
‘Office, which informed me that I
am a Provost Scholar. That is, bas-
ed on my Q.P.A., one of the top
100 scholars in the University. I
also learned that Pitt is “continual-
ly interested in upgrading the quali-
ty and diversifying the character of
its resident student population.” I
was then encouraged to help
upgrade the quality by’ remaining in
the dorms. I was also exempt from
the lottery system. I chose to re’-
main in the dorms which meant I
would have to participate in room
selection. After waiting two-and-
One-half hours in a hot, smoke-
filled area, I was finally able to
choose a room to be my room—857
Lothrop Hall. This room, a single,
has two windows, a walk-in closet,
and shares a bathroom, a kitchen,

and another closet with two other
single rooms. I_ was ecstatic. I

began sewing for my room, making

a rug, buying various items of fur-

niture and spending much money

preparing to move in, not to men-

tionmy $100 room deposit. Then I
received your letter informing_me I
was no longer to live in 857, but in a
room with one window, a war-
drobe, and I am to share a
bathroom and kitchen with the en-
tire floor. Needless to say, I am
more than just a bit upset. '

I fully- expected you to honor
your commitment to me before you
entered another commitment with
the professional. You promised her
something that was already promis-
ed to me. The room could have
been saved inanticipation of the ap-
proval for hiring a professional.
You should not have offered it to
her if you could not produce a room
for me of equal value. Besides be-
ing unbusinesslike, it is rude.
Maybe she would like to live in the
room you reassigned for me. It will
only be for eight months, then she
can have 857, free from any prior
promises.

I am thoroughly disappointed
with the casual regard Pitt has for
its students’ feelings. Although
claiming to serve the needs of the
students, - Pitt fails to meet this
claim. It is shocking to think that I
cannot trust this institution of
higher learning, especially with
something as important as my hous-
Ing.

You claim, Ms.’ Woodson, that

, the selection of my room was not

done in an arbitrary fashion.
Assuming Pitt_has done this in the
past, can I also assume you have
some “scientific method” for cast-
ing students out of their rooms? Or
is it that this room for which I
waited so long in line was well
worth the wait? a

Informing me of your choice to
move my room assignment at this
very late date demonstrates a lack
of commitment and aninsensitivity
to the welfare of the students. Not
only was my room taken away from

315" umin. :LPnY.z1’5_Ac.t<._"

nity house for the group tobe con- 5‘
sidered satisfactorily coed. Some-

national fraternities having chapters
there have previously said they will
not be able to abide by the require-
ment' and probably will remove
their affiliation from the campus.

Bowdoin College has taken

similar action, and rumblings along

this line have been expressed at Col-
gate, MIT, and many other institu-
tIons lI1'th‘e northeast.

It is my own interpretation of the
law that fraternities and sororities
have the legal right to remain single-

sex organizations. It is an opinion '
that is held by the national fraterni-

ty and sorority organizations and
most likely will be tested in court.
Hopefully, tradition will prevail.

me without any warning, but it was
taken away too late for me to ob-
tain a decent apartment off-
campus. The accommodations you

have substituted are of an inferior _

value and are easily "obtainable by

"any student at this university. Wh_y -

else do you assume no one has
chosen the room you reassigned to
me as of July? If I cannot have the
room I chose, I at least expect to be
provided with a room of.equivalent

quality.

Please point out to me which
phrase in my housing contract en-.
titles you to relocate me merely
because you have hired a profes-
sional. May I remind you that my
contract was signed prior to the hir-
ing of the Area Coordinator?

I expect to hear from you soon.

Posvari Discusses: Tuition, Affirmative Action,

of this. . .the bulk of this aid goes
to low income students. (Tuition
hikes) really hurt the middle-class
student. It really hurts the students
whose family income is sufficiently
high that they don’t qualify for aid.
Those are the ones who get hurt,
the ones whose parents make 20,
25, 30 thousand dollars a year and
up, are the ones who get hurt.

There are reports that you are not
actually running the university
anymore on a day-to-day basis, but
that these responsibilities have been
handed to your senior vice
chancellor, Jack Freeman, and that
your role has become more of
figurehead for Pitt. . .for instance
increasing your efforts in soliciting
funds, traveling abroad, recruiting,
are these reports factual?

That’s absurd. Not true at all.
The longest I’ve been away from
the university in the last year was
around 12 ‘days last summer, other
than that, a week at a time. I’m on
the phone every day. So your ques-
tion is irrelevant. There are three
principal deputies in the university
—the vice-chancellor and‘ provost
for academic affairs and vice-
chancellor for the health centers,
and those are the two senior posi-
tions, and the third-ranking posi-
tion is the senior ‘vice-chancellor-
that’s Freeman. And last year we
reorganized to put athletics and stu-
dent affairs under him, in order to
simplify the structure and. . .see,
the job has become so complex that
I was dealing with excessive details
and "excessive spans of control, so
we reduced that. And it’s truethat

cent of the decisions that are major

What will an FM station do for

I think it will. First of all because
it’s a very good training experience
for students—in communications.

And I think it will improve the com- -. - — ii

people will know more what’s going

A CHORUS LINE

' Conceived, directed and
choreographed by Michael
Bennett

Music by Marvin Hamlisch 1
Heinz Hall
July’ 7, I980

By CANDICE KOMAR

The National Touring Company

. J_

of A Chorus Line was received as ’

fondly as any of Pittsburgh's own
Civic Light Opera productions.
‘ The packed houses opened their
hearts to the talented troupe of per-

 formers who act, sing, and dance

equally well. A Chorus Line had
been a hit on Broadway for almost
three years before it was taken out
on the road. The show is not dif-
ficult to tour with since the basic
costumes involve only regular
dancer’s warmups and leotards,
and the only props are mirrors, tote
bags, and a white line across the
stage.

The opening draws you into the
show‘ immediately by putting the
audience in the middle of an audi-

' _ ,tion with the dancers facing the

‘T

huge mirror, their backs to the au-
dience. Thishappens at different
times during the show. The dancers
have to project‘ twice as hard to get
some one to watch them perform
from behind. Zack, the director
(David Thome), calls out a group of
numbers and we are left with the
seventeen dancers who will con-

_ tinue to compete for eight places in

the chorus.

The director tells them he has cer-

tain roles he might want to assign‘
_ each dancer, so he asks them to first

go down the line and give their
name, age, and birthplace. That is
not easy for some of the dancers,
most of whom are reluctant to
reveal anything about themselves.

Zach then asks them to talk about
themselves a bit, and one can feel
the sickening wave of panic that

' sweeps down the line. While each

one is “on” the others are standing
there thinking of whether to make
up a story about their past to draw

‘ backs.

I

attention to themselves or to simply
tell the truth.‘

They wind up having no choice
because Zach uncannily can tell
whether he is being put on or not.
The characters turn out to be
memorable as they really are. It is a
bit unsettling when Zach knows
whether he is getting the truth or
not, and it is more than a bit sur-
prising that he even cares. How
many directors are compassionate
and concerned with the lives of
audition applicants? Not many,
I’m afraid, yet this is the basis for
the show. The gradual melting of
exteriors is very interesting to ex-
perience. The characters are
brought out clearly without being
too forced. It is hard not to care
about each“ dancer’s chances
throughout the audition.

The show turns fr_om this point
into the_meaning behind the audi-
tion itself—the reason why these
people do what they do, why
dancers keep on performing despite
injury, rejection and personal set-
The question is never
answered outright, but is subtly
hinted at, and each person can sur-
misc’ for themselves what it is.

The set was simple but perfect in
terms of the shows topic and for-
mat. Lighting was kept simple, yet
classic, casting an interrogating
glare as the dancers are in the
lineup, blazing footlights in the mir-

‘tor, and dimming into rehersal-

studio shadows. One of the nicest
numbers of the show was perform-
ed by.Cassie (Tina Paul) entitled
“The Music and the Mirror”. A
semicircle consisting of mirror
panels was lowered in front of the
back mirror creating a stunning ef-

‘feet with Miss Paul's dancing. All

the other popular songs such as
“What I Did for Love”,
“Nothing”, and “One” were
wonderfully done. The cast had an
amazing energy level that they
managed to sustain throughout the
show which was performed without
intermission and lasted almost two
hours.

The finale (thanks to an incredi-
ble quick change by the dancers)

Maybe so, but strangely enough the
cameraman’s goal seemed to be to
get Redford in every frame. We
certainly know that prisons are nas-
ty places, (guards do improper
things to prisoners, prisoners are in-
humane to fellow inmates, etc).
But in Brubaker, this particular
southern prison is made to look like
Auschwitz all over again.

Penitentiary, on the other hand,
while far from being a ﬂowless
fillm, offers a more realistic look at
prison life. Jail is hell in Peniten-
tiary, but it is a real hell, one that
exists i-n say, Western Penitentiary,
or the county jail, now some off-
beat Alabama correctional facility
where the guards are all klansmen
and facists.

Like Brubaker, Penitentiary is
based on a ture story. An imprison-
ed professional boxer, who’s only

.way out is to make a success with

his «fists. The film, rather preten-
tiously claims to be “the most im-
portant black film in ten years.”
That’s quite a claim, but then, try
to remember the last sucessful (for-

like Hollywood. Except the praise
or humiliation of theatre is more
immediate, more intensified. It’s

has “stars in his eyes.” He’s in the

As an understudy with the na-
tional touring company ‘of A
Chorus Line, Kevin Backstromhas
come a long way from Clairton,
Pa., and has still an even longer
way to go.
company was in Boston, perform-
ing six nights a week (Backstrom
has been with the touring company
three months), when Backstrom
granted SHOWCASE a telephone
interview. ' One day after the
Broadway company put on its
2000th performance, Backstrom
talked ’ with SHOWCASE about
what it’s like to be performing on
the road, his past, his hopes for the
future after A Chorus Line and
Backstrom go their separate ways.
The following is an excerpt from
the Boston conversation.

SHOWCASE:

Backstrom: Well, I’nf from Jeffer-
son Boro, Pennsylvania near Clair-
ton. And I've been there all my
life. . .until this past February when
I moved to New York.
SHOWCASE: When did you first
become interested in the theater?
Backstrom: Well, I first started
taking dance lessons when I was
five-and—a-half, which I kept doing
up to now.

SHOWCASE: Have you audition-
ed for any other Broadway or off-
Broadway shows since moving to
New York?

Backstrom: I had auditioned for a
show called Swing, which was_ head-
ed for Broadway, but then closed,
and didn’t get it. And I had audi-
tioned for several other things in
New York;, dinner theater, nothing
real big and then I had just moved
to New York in February, and a day
before the Chorus Line audition, I

dancer or a performer to feel the
charge that comes out of this great
cast, or to be touched by the sen-

itself which are those we all ex-

another.’ The final image is the

was called back two weeks later,
and in that time, I found an apart-
ment. And, they called back and
said they liked me. They said,
“We’ll call you sometime if we need
you, but right now, we're ‘not
sure. . .And then, I got mono, and I

 

' was sick for six weeks. So, I decid-

ed to come home to Pittsburgh, and
let Mom_cook for a while. And
then, they called me in Pittsburgh,
and said we’d like you to come back
for another call back.
SHOWCASE: In your opinion, is
breaking into the theatre particular-
ly difficult?

Backstrom: It is. .. simply because
there is so much luck involved.
And it’s not like applying for an
engineering position, or whatever,
where your qualifications - are all
that count. It’s ’so -subjective,
because the people that are on the
other side of the table are just as
subjective as you would be about
any personal matter, friendship,
whatever. It’s a lot of, what they’re
looking for, what type, where you
are at the time, being in theright
place at the right time—not just
talent, not just experience." The
simple fact that can’t even really
control what you do in it. And you
do the best you can, and if ‘/you've
done it, after that there really isn’t a
hell of a lot of control. I don’t
think you do. I figure at anytime,
my chances are as good as anybody
else’s. ‘
SHOWCASE: Where did you go to
dance school?

Backstrom; I went to" a place in
Clairton called the Audrey and
Elinor School of Dance. And when
Audrey left, it became‘ the Elinor
Bakalis School of Dance. Actually,
when I look back, it was really a
good dance school, back then_, but
now, it doesn’t seem to be as good.
I refer to it as the Dolly Dinkle
Dance School, sometimes. But my

training there was ‘pretty good. I "

know a number of people who have
had a lot of training, and had to
relearn. I consider myself rather
lucky in my basic training.

SHOWCASE: Have you gone to
other dance studios ‘outside of the
Pittsburgh area? '

Backstrom: Oh yeah. Sure, I’ve
taken Classes on the road. On the

.road— you take classes wherever you

can. I'm taking some in Boston,

and some in Philadelphia. And I ,

SHOWCASE: Is" there such a thing
as a social life for a cast member?
Backstrom: Social life? xSure
(laugh). In fact, on the road that’s
most of it. We work hard, but the
rest of the time.  and plus you’re

so wound up after a show, so —

keyed-up that right afterwards you

can’t just go home and go to bed. '

You’ve really got to wind down and
so you tend to have a social life.
SHOWCASE: Roughly, how many
hours a week are spent in rehearsal
for the shows?

. Backstrom: Well, it varies. a lot,

because once the show is set, the
rehearsals aren’t that often. There
are understudy rehearsals every

week for about three hours a week. ‘

And there are individual rehearsals
that meet during the week. It’s a
hard demand on your body to do
even the -opening”. ‘ Understudies

don’t do the entire show, but the 4

first ten to fifteen minutes of the
show are the hardest of the whole
show in terms of dancing. So we
have to be as ready as anybody else.
SHOWCASE: Do you think there
is an adequate appreciation for
theater here in Pittsburgh? _ _
Backstrom: I think it’s very under-
rated. I think the people’s jap-
preciation of it is very underrated. I
think people think PITTSBURGH,

but really, we pack the houses in _

Pittsburgh as well as ‘anywhere else.

As--far as I know A Chorus Line is I

pretty much sold out._ The Civic
Light Opera last year was practical-
ly sold out for much of the season.

I think they have a great apprecia-
tion for when something good
comes to town. It’s just been in the
past few years that good things have
been coming to Pittsburgh. I mean,
there was a time when there wasn’t
much around. People. . .if they
like what they saw they’,ll come
back and I think that’s true of any
city. People aren’t‘ out to impress
each othere as much as out in
Washington, D.C. or someplace.

Going to the theatre to be seen, not
to see the theatre. It much more
low-key, they go to enjoy a show,
and so that’s a praise on their abili-
ty to appreciate shows.
idea most people get of Pittsburgh
is wearing hard hats and drinking
Iron City Light all the time. That’s

’ all right too but I think they _canap-

preciate more than that.

Pitt News Feature

  Ghost Hunting In The Cathedral

‘K:;:.\

By MARILYN C. LEVY
pm News Staff Writer '

How do'y_ou prove the existence
of a ghost? I ask that question, not
rhetorically, but in a sincere vein.
What I say will sound ludicrous
because it can’t be documented or
verified by a highly credible source.

I’m waitressing this summer and
I’ve met all kinds. The jerks who
work me to a pulp and never leave a
cent; the guys with the walking
hands and the prissy women in the
flowered frocks, who can put down
more bourbon than Meatloaf’s
roadies. However, one regular is a
pleasant person to wait on, Harry, a
retired Pitt campus policeman.

Harry tells me not to leave my
calculator or purse unattended in
the library and not to walk around
the campus alone past dark. When
business was slow a couple of weeks

' ago, Harry and I had some time to

sit and really talk to each other.
He tpld me one of the most fan-
tastic stories I have heard in my life.

V He claims he talked to the ghost of

a young woman through the door
of the Early American Room on "the
third floor of the Cathedral of
Learning on a late December even-

‘ing during a power blackout.

“Sir,’ he heard, “you with the
musket, have you seen my veil?”

(Editor’s note:
tual, part fictional account.)

This is a part fac-_

“Who is it?” he asked.

“I am Jennifer Wright,” the soft
pleading voice responded. “I_have
lost my veil.”

“What do you need a veil for?”
Harry asked, trying to keep his
composure.

“I blew my face off with a
shotgun years ago because my
parents were arranging for me to
marry Aaron whilst I was in love
with Po...the last thing that I
remember was my dog howling.”

“I can see why you would want
to cover your face,” Harry

- murmered. “Just put your veil on

if you decide to walk around.” .

“Thank-you,” she replied. And
that was all. I _

Other Campus policemen and‘
security ‘guards said that they have
heard
Cathedral such as dogs howling and
hysterical laughter, but no one men-
tioned an encounter quiie like
Harry’s. ' V

I decided to do some on-the-spot
investigating of my own, so instead

of playing badminton, eating hot‘

dogs and watching the fireworks on
the Fourth of July, I snuck into the
Cathedral before it closed in order
to see the ghost.

Ataround 2:45 a.m. I was bored,
so I decided to open a can of Iron
City beer. (So what is so wrong
with having a beer on the Fourth of
July?) '

strange noises in the"

As I slowly opened the beer can, I
heard a damp, clomp, clomp, slam,
clomp, slam from the inside of the
Early American Room.

My feet were too flabberghasted
to run. I had to see the ghost. I had

to complete my task no matter

what.

“Jenny,” I whispered, “may I
speak with you?”

“Who are you?” she moaned.

“I’m Marilyn C. Levy.”

.“What do you want?”

“I’d like to talk to you, so come
out and talk to me. Just make sure
that you have your veil on.”

“I have lost my veil,” she cried.

It took only a second to realize
that the brown paper bag which the
beers were’ in would serve the func-
tion of covering her scorched face. I
poked two eye holes out of the bag
and slid itlunder the door.

“Jenny, put the bag over your
head and come out into the halland
talk to me, please.” A

I couldn’t believe how cordial I
was being to a ghost! As I sat on
the floor shivering, I saw the door
slowly open and Jenny set out. She
was very small, no taller than an
average ten-year-old and she was
wearing a simple gray, floor-length
dress which w heavily spotted
with blood. What was so funny was
the brown paper bag on her head.
She looked like the Unknown Com-
1c.

“Come, sit,” I said’ pointing to
the floor. She sat down on the ﬂoor
like a perfect lady. She was sitting
on the side of her thighs with her
knees together. ~

“Have a beer,” I asked.

“It is a sin to partake in the con-

. sumption of alcohol,” she preach-

ed.
“What’s the difference, ,you’re
already dead?”

“Well, actually, .no one has ever

offered.
highly.” A

I then took a can and pulled off
the pull tab for her because I knew
that she had never seen a pull tab in
her day. V '

“Watch out for the hole. It can
be sharp,” I warned her.’

“Jenny, I would like to talk to
you about the women’s movement.
The women’s movement is striving
to make this world a place where a
person is in control of one’s
destiny. Like in your case, "you
wouldn’t have had to have had a
single worry about marrying a man

I would appreciate it

you didn’t love. In today’s world, .

you wouldn’t have even gotten mar-
ried. Women go to school and be-
come professors, doctors, and
would you believe this——a woman is
the prime minister of England
now!” I '

“But who is having the children,
and who is tending to the house-
hold’s needs?” she asked in
astonishment. I

' Complaints Against Burger Chef

If the College of General Studies
(CGS) has its way, Burger Chef

won’t be in the Cathedral after its

contract-expires in the fall of 1981.
According to David Huffner,
former president of the (Student

,. Cabinet, a lot of people have voiced

complaints about the quality of the
food, lack of diversity of menu

items and the personnel.

Last year the university extended
Burger Chef’s contract for another
year. The CGS was not consulted
until afterlthis had taken place, but,
according to Huffner, the CGS has
made it clear that they will be in-
volved when Burger Chef ’s contract

expires next year. '

I ' Jwednesday, Julylsl, I-980’-—PIge 7 

“Oh, people are getting married
and having children, but life
doesn’t end there.- We have all

kinds of mechanical devices which. I
make life a lot easier. Have you,

seen the Burger Chef?”

“See it?” she shrieked. “You
don’t have to see it to know that it
exists. I used to bake bread daily
and the aroma would fill the ‘air,
but I'll never be able to understand

what and why you people do what»

you do, even though it takes less‘
time. I have been reading the news-
paper and I know what is going on.
I refuse to envision some things
such as nuclear energy but, on the
other hand, some aspects seem "even
too ‘good to ‘envision, ‘like the
women’s movement and this beer. I
have to go now, but would I be able
to take a can of this splendid beer

‘with me?” A
“Really, you have to go?” I ask- "

ed.

As. she stood up to leave, she _

thanked me for the hospitality and I
handed her another ‘can \of beer

She opened the door to the Early“. I

American Room and ﬂoated inside.
As I heard the door latch, I looked
on the ‘floor and there was the
brown paper bag with the‘ two eye
holes and a big puddle of beer.‘

According to Huffner, 25 percent

of all the complaints the CGS gets

are about food services.
