tions prepared Cox to become the director
of the counseling center. He first served
as a counselor, then became an associate
director in 1998. Before coming to Pitt, he
also worked at Dickinson College as the
counselor and coordinator of minority
affairs, and at Duquesne University as a
mental health specialist.

As director of the counseling center,
Cox helped set up the Stress Free Zone in
the William Pitt Union, increased psychi-
atric services and helped the center deal

with a year—by-year increase in demand
for services. Y" -

“When I took over, the Counseling Cen-
ter was in very good shape, and I trie.d to
maintain that,” Cox said.

Sharon Young, the associate direc-

tor at the center, has worked alongside’
Cox since last December and said that he
has “really been a strong and supportive
leader and mentor for all of us here at the
counseling center.” I -
Young said that Cox has been really
dedicated to the work that the Counsel-

ing Center does withstudents and has
overseen a lot of its growth and devel-
opment.

Cox said he is excited to return to the
classroom this fall to teach full time at the
School of Social Work. He will be teaching
four classes —'_ one undergraduate and
three graduate classes.

“As a teacher, I am looking forward to
teaching other students so each one of
them can go out and I can still make an
impact,” Cox said. ,

EDITORIAL

Newt Pitt policy

In Monday’s edition of The Pitt
News, we reported a new change to
school policy: an alcohol amnesty
program that-dismisses any legal
action’ against someone who calls

for help for another person who '

has been drinking.

Although we applaud the state’s
decision to implement a bare—min—
imum approach to removing bar-
riers to calling for help, we don’t
think Pitt stepped up its own policy
to ﬁt the needs of its students.

Right down the_street, Carnegie
Mellon students have the privilege
of full amnesty from criminal re-
percussions when seeking medical
help —— and that amnesty‘ extends
to the person who needs the at-
tention as well. CMU’s policy does

not come without consequences, -

though: Students who use the ani-
nesty privilege must participate in
the university’s alcohol-awareness
programs. Temple University has
a similar amnesty system.

Carnegie Mellon has fewer than
6,000 undergraduate students.
Pitt has three times that, with
more than 18,000.

We think Pitt has no reason to
maintain such a lukewarm policy.
Granting amnesty only to the per-
son who takes responsibility for
another’s welfare covers only half
the bases.

Although binge drinking and
medical care are two serious issues
—- and every good friend certainly
values his friend’s life over a crimi-
nal record —— imagine how many
people will still take their friend’s
care into their own hands to avoid
punitive consequences.

Rewind to September 2009
when Penn State freshman Joe
Dado died after he fell down a
ﬂight of stairs. He was drinking at
parties with friends immediately

misses mark

before his death. Instead of peo-
ple taking responsibility for Dado
while he was under the inﬂuence,
the fraternity he attended faces 70
days of community service and a
$500 ﬁne._ '

After Dado’s death, Penn State
implemented a policy similar to
the one that is now required by the
state. If his friends knew that they
wouldn’t get in trouble for taking
him to the hospital, maybe he’d be
alive today.

With a policy like CMU’s, un-
derage and binge drinking isn’t
condoned. Someone who gets so
drunk that he needs medical at-
tention needs educational involve-

ment, not a damaged permanent,

record with little counseling. V
‘Even with Pitt-’s current poli-

cy, though, there is no excuse to ‘

avoid trouble if someone’s health
is on the line. No price can be paid
for a lost life, and the sacriﬁce of
prevention is always worth it. N o
matter what Pitt’s policy is, we

think everyone’s health should ‘

come ﬁrst.

We do not condone binge drink-
ing or underage drinking, but we
acknowledge that party behavior is
pervasive on college campuses.

And in order to encourage all
students -—— impaired or not — to
make the right decisions in times
of emergency, Pitt needs to take
the-steps to a more liberal alcohol
amnesty policy. When all students
have adapted to the idea that they

. will not get in trouble for doing

what needs to be done in emer-

gency cases, we’ll be on our way —

to a safer campus. _

We think waking up the morn-
ing after making poor drinking
decisions is punishment enough.
Pitt should realize that saving a life
is the best policy there is. I

Think we're crazy?

THE STAMATIACK

Stamatakis: Good ideas

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Watch out everybody, an engineer is

aboutto give communications majors
some love. A

I must say, such language would
be unexpected from me before last
summer. Like most engineers, I had
a little bit of that lovable and well-
known engineering attitude toward
everybody else.

But as the economy begins to un-
ravel again, pundits and economists
continue to debate the correct course
of action. And it’s clear that facts or
even ideas don’t really move the
world, like engineers and scientists

often suppose;.both of those ‘things 3

are too abstract to capture people’s
hearts. Instead, its people that do. And
people only move the world if they can
communicate. ’

This doesn’t mean ideas don’t
change the world —— democracy and
Taco Bell’s Fourthmeal all spread be-
cause they brought greater beneﬁt to
everybody in ﬁmdamental ways. But
without an effective vessel, whether
it be a Thomas Jefferson or a ﬂashy

advertising campaign, nothing hap-
pens.

The most crystalline example of
thiswasanAugusttapingofABC News’
Sunday Morning program, “This
Week,” featuring liberal economist
Paul Krugman, conservatives Grover
Norquist and George Wills and com-
mentator George Stephanopoulos.

Krugman, aﬁerce proponent of
government spending, defended his
position With logic and statistics.
He said that whereas companies are
holding vast amounts of cash, they
aren’t investing‘ in jobs because they
don’t perceive any real-demand for
more goods. Government spending

‘ provides demand for a new, ‘vibrant

economy.

Yet judging from the other panel-
ists’ responses, his message didn’tap-
pearto have much resonance. N orquist
and Wills responded sarcastically and

 ignoring some points and

talking around others. Stephanopo—
ulos, theoretically the moderate, dis-
missed Krugman’s points as well.
One explanation for this is that
there is just a genuinepolitical differ-

ence between the contributor’s view-.

don’t sell themselves

points. Television, ‘as ‘jersey Shore”

has taught us, does not lend itselfto -

completely civil behavior. Opposing

_ views don’t generally lead to beauti-

ﬁllfriendships, andfull attention and
respect usually disappear.

But perhaps more". explanatory
of K1ugman’s poor reception was his

way of communicating. His speaking ‘

style is prickly, consisting of quick jabs
and insults, all delivered with shifting
eyes and coweringbody language. His
trademark tactic seems to be insult-
ing the intelligence of his opponents.
The smartness and wit of his writing
transforms into squirrely jabbering
when he speaks. .

It isn’t even because Krugman
comes across as too bookish that he
has a problem. Popular scientist Carl
Sagan turned public opinion toward
more NASA ﬁmding in the late ’9 0s,
maintainingalikable demeanorwhile
giving what essendally amounted to
televised science lectures. People
can respond to l“sm ” discussion
styles, but they don’t respond well to
off-putting discussion styles.

It is little wonder then, that for all

Cyclists get a hand|e(bar) on biking in the ’Burgh

Emma Kilcup

Staﬁ" Writer V

With the price of gas hovering some-
where around $3.50 and a greater
national emphasis on physical activ-
ity, biking is starting to look even
more like a cost-effective and waist-
whittling alternative. And it’s all the
better because Pittsburgh has gotten
more bike-friendly.

Both the city and Pitt have in-
creased the accessibility of biking
—— whereas the University offers
more bike racks in front ofbuildings,
the city has built more bikelanes,
including some that will soon span
Bloomﬁeld to Fifth Avenue. Bicycle
Magazine listed Pittsburgh as No.
28 out of the 50 most bike—friendly
cities. The magazine claims that to
make the list, the city must “support
a vibrant and diverse bike culture”
and host “smart, savvy bike shops”
along with “segregated bike lanes,
municipal bike racks and bike bou-
levards.”

Pittsburgh boasts a growing
bike community. Numerous orga-
nizations such as Bike Pittsburgh,
the Bicycle Advisory Council and
Flock of Cycles exist to offer infor-
mation, and events like BikeFest,
hosted by Bike Pittsburgh, celebrate
the expanding number of cyclists.
The current atmosphere is quite
different from that of the cycling
community of Pittsburgh’s past.
At one time the biking community
was small, and moving through the
Steel City on two wheels could be
hazardous.

In 1990 the League of Ameri— .
can Bicyclists, a national group
devoted to encouraging biking,
rated Pittsburgh third out of the 10
worst cities for biking. In 2010, they
granted Pittsburgh a bronze bike-
friendly community award, citing
one of the highlights as Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl’s Bicycle and Pedestrian
Initiatives intended to create a bet-
ter transportation environment
with measures such as more signs
for trails.

“There used to be a point when
you knew every person on a bike.
A daily occurrence was getting in
an argument or having something
thrown at you if you were biking.
People would harass you. But now
drivers are more used to seeingbike
riders and there are so many more,”

Eric Boerer of Bike Pittsburgh,
co-founder of BikeFest, said. The
event just enjoyed its seventh an-
niversary.

Boerer moved to Pittsburgh in
1995. Back then, when he was earn-
ing a degree in ecology and evolution
at Pitt, he realized bikingwas abetter
alternative to the congested traffic
of driving and the time—consuming
endeavor of ﬁnding parking. He
said that, initially, he thought bik-
ing around the city was “nerve-
wracking” since many cyclists rode
on the sidewalks. Now havingbiked
foryears, he appreciates the addition
of new bike lanes.

The Three Rivers Heritage Trail
System — an expansive group of

 

time I was riding from downtown to
Oakland and people decided to cross
the street as Iwas coming up so Ifell

off my bike as I tried to brake,” said _

Pitt sophomore Katie Blackburn.
“They’re not looking for bikers,
they’re only looking out for cars.”

Still, biking is a convenient al-
ternative to driving or walking for
students. ‘

“It is a 35-minute walk to my
apartment in Shadyside, but I can
ride from there to the Cathedral in
ﬁve minutes,” said Dohar. .

But Pitt has some catching up
to do compared with universities
like Carnegie Mellon and Chatham.
CMU has built bike lanes around
campus to help students commute

A daily occurrence was

getting into an argument or

having something thrown at

you if you were biking. But

now drivers are more used  

to seeing bike riders.

—~Eric Boerer

trails that connect most neigh-
borhoods and areas — offers paths
for commuters to make it to Oakland.
But some of the busiest streets, like
Forbes and Fifth around Pitt, lack
bike lanes, prompting commuters
to bike illegally in bus lanes and on
sidewalks. Though the task can be
daunting, students still choose to
bike ride around campus.

“Once I got past the fear of riding
on Fifth and Forbes, it got easier after
gaining conﬁdence,” Pitt sophomore

they then transform with their presence.

“There are economic seeds where there
are artists, so incentives for pioneers who

can start the ball rolling,” he said.

REPORTING BY MERRIIT WUCHINA AND PHOTOS BY SARAH NAUER

Cultural anthropologist and pro-
fessor Hugo Nutini has been doing
ﬁeld work in Mexico for the past
60 years, studying social stratiﬁ-’
cation, organization, kinship and
religion. He has also worked in
the tropical forest of Brazil and
Venezuela and traveled through
other countries such as Peru. Us-
ing artwork, handicrafts and real
and replicated ancient artifacts, he
has adorned his office to reﬂect his
travels in Latin America.

Image #1: These masks from
several parts of Mexico ——' fash-
ioned to look like mythological
creatures —— are used today in sec-
ular dance ‘ceremonies and made
primarily for the tourist trade.

Image #2: This small sculpture
is a replica of erotic art done by
the Mochica society in Peru over
2,500 years ago. “All societies have
erotic art — even pornographic —
from ancient times to the present,”
Nutini explained. “There are muse-
ums [in Peru] that only adults are
allowed to see. The artist wanted to
express him or herself, but women
did not do pottery in Peru.”

Image #3: Nutini has two paint-
ings by the contemporary Mexican
painter and muralist [Desiderio
Hernandez] Xochitiotzin of the
Aztec god of wind called Tlaloc.
“The popular name of this group
is Aztec, but the tribal name is
Mexica—Tenochca, it was the tribal/
state name of the Aztecs,” he said.
“They have been transformed from
an Indian to Mestiza people. The
nation has other myths now like
the Virgin of Guadalupe, since they
were converted to Catholicism.”

Image #4 : Nutini received face:
like ﬁgurines and arrowheads as
a gift in Mesoamerica. “Many dif-
ferent Indian groups in Central
Mexico believe that when you die
you go on a pilgrimage for four
years until you arrive at your ﬁnal
destination,” he said. “These items
would accompany the dead.”

Image #5: Quetzalcoatl is also a
Mesoamerican deity of knowledge

means “bird—serpent.” Nutini

Keynes’ popularity garnered support for his ideas

Stamatakis 4 6

ofKrugman’s crowing, very little ofhis policy has
been turned into practice. Even with a widely
read blog, a column in The New York Times and a
N obelPrize, few politicians seem like they’d ever
risk calling themselves a follower of his ideas.
This stands insharp contrast to Krugman’s
intellectual father, John Maynard Keynes, the

mid—20thcentLuy\economistwho developedthe '

theories Krugman today professes, Like Krug-

— man, Keyneswroteverypersuasivelydutingan

economic calamity like the Great Depression,
viciously attacking the prevailing economic
thought. The only difference was that people

liked 

In his day, Keynes was thejustin Timberlake
of economics. His policies became practice not
because of evidence, which was arguably lack-
ing, orhis logic, which was arguably ﬂawed, but
because he had gravitas. He had an uncanny
ability to capture the attention of a room. To
his supporters, like economist Lionel Robbins,
thiswas asign of a “unique unearthlike quality of
which one can only say that it’s pure genius.”

To his detractors, this made him a con, al-.

lowing him to seduce important people, such
aspoliticians and students. Eitherway, itiswhat

madehis ideas on economics rule the world ﬁ'om
the end of World War II until the ’70s.

This returns me to my praise for the value
of communications. Even in one of the most
mathematical of the social sciences, econom-
ics, change to the world only comes if you can
sell it After all, you don’t buy a car from a poor
salesman, you don’t pick a girlfriend because
she meets some kind of shallow criteria, and

you don’t change the world just because you i

have good ideas.
All of it, at the worldwide or personal level,
happens only because at the end of the day, one

person agrees with what another person says. at.
This agreement happens partially because the
core idea is good, but also — and maybe just as
importantly — because the person speaking
is liked. And people like people who can com-
municate well.

‘ So take a few communication classes if you _
can, or join speaking groups like Toastmasters
International. Be a Keynes, not a Krugman.

SOCCER

Pitt’s new coach

still adjusting  

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Malorie Rutledge always wanted to
coach. But maybe not this soon.
Rutledge, who the Pitt women’s

_, soccer program hired inAugus.t as an

assistant coach, had to retire as a play-
er last year after she underwent the
fourth knee surgery of her career.

Rutledge said it’s difficult not play-
ing competitively, but she still feeds
her passion for the sport in practice
when she can.

“I just have a passion for playing,
and it is tough, but Coach [Sue-Moy
Chin] lets me jump in alittle bit when-
ever I can,” she said. “Four knee sur-
geries later I just had to tie up the boots

= and call it quits.”

The expansion team Philadelphia
Independence of Women’s Profes-
sional Soccer selected Rutledge 13th
overall inthe second round of the WPS
College Draft injanuary 2010, but her
mulﬁple knee injuries eventually took
their toll. The Independence waived
her two months after draﬁingher, and
she retired.

Despite the premature end to her
playing days, she is embracing the op-
portunity to coach soccer ataDivision

.. Ischool.

“I’ve knownlwantedto be acoach
since I actually went into college,” she
said in an interview Tuesday. “I ma-

jored for it.”

 

Courtesy of the University
of Pittsburgh

Pitt hired Rutledge this summer
as an assistant coach.

Rutledge studied sociology at
Louisiana State University, where
she setwomen’s soccerschool records
for career assists (46), points (102),
game-winning goals (12) and starts
(88). Her senior class won a record 50
games from 2006 to 2009, including
three SEC Western Division champi-

g onships.

After her retirementas aplayer, she
jumped into coaching, volunteering as
an assistant at LSU last year before
moving to Pittsburgh for a full—time
position — her ﬁrst —— with the Pan-
thers this season.
»“WhenI got done playing, I knew it

was time to start my coaching career,” ‘

she said.

The shiftwas more than a mental
one. , V

Rutledge — who hails from
Sharpsburg, Ga. — had never been
to Pittsburgh. She said the greatest
obstacle in’ heryoung coaching career
hasn’t been on the ﬁeld, it’s been as-
similating to her new home.

“The biggest thing is moving up
here. I had three or four days to move
up to Pittsburgh. I’ve never been
here. It’s a great area, but I’m getting
adjusted,” she said. “We’ve been in
preseason, so I really haven’t gone

outside of the campus too much, but '

I ﬁnally have a place to live and I’m
good to go.”

Rutledge’s journey from Georgia
to Louisianato Pennsylvania occurred
afteravisitwith Chin and herstaﬁ'ear-
lierthisyear. .

“I saw online that [Pitt] was hir-
ing,” Rutledge said. “I came up here,
and they were the nicest people. It’s a
greatfacility and it’s aD—I school. I just
love to be here.”

She showed interest in’ Pitt just as
Chin and her staff were looking for
someone with her background. ,

“Obviouslyherplayingbackground
isvery extensive and impressive, so it’s
justa matterthat herplayingcareer got
cut short with some injuries. She al-
ways knew that she wanted to coach,”

Chinsaid.“Thetimingjustworked out_

...with us havingthe position openand

THE WISDOM OF SAUL

The NFL season provides
players to root against 

Isaac Saul

‘ Assistant Sports Editor

Each fall, America experiences an en-

vironmental change that comes with

as much certainty as the sunrise.
No, it isn’t the temperature drop-

ping. It’s not the leaves changing col-

ors, either. It’s the environmental

change most people call “football

season,” but I like to call it a transi-
tion into heaven.

That’s because the world’s most
entertaining sports season is slowly
going to knock baseball out of Sports-
Center’s top plays. It’s because I’d
rather watch Terrell Owens do bicep
curls in his driveway than see Alex
Rodriguez complete a throw to ﬁrst
base from his knees. .

But most importantly, it’s because
I get to choose who to root against. I
have this privilege because my favor-

ite team, the Washington Redskins -

— namely, Daniel Snyder — have
driven themselves into such a dark
place that I can’t say I root for them
-anymore.

Sure, I watch every down of ev-
ery game of every season. But that
doesn’t make me a fan. I’d be a fan
if I liked what I was seeing. So while
the Redskins ﬁnd new ways to lose
this season, rm going to go out
and seek a few people I’cl like to see
dragged down into sports infamy
with them.

This summer, after drinking my
haterade.each morning, the choices
have become easier and easier. After
long hours of intenseresearch, note
taking, study and laughter, I have
chosen the ﬁve players I’d like to see
fail miserably this season. _

Albert Haynesworth — This
one is easy, for a few reasons. Firstly,
Haynesworth is just a horrible per-
son. I mean that with all the sincerity
I can muster. He’s the guy who stomps
on the face of a player missing his hel-
met (intentionally). He’s the guy who
takes a $100 million contract and
then cries like a big3o0—pound baby

because he has to change positions. —

He’s also the guy who Bill Belichick
took a chance on, and I’ve been pa-

tiently waiting for Belichick to err in
a decision like this for years — just
to prove he’s human.

Tony Romo -5 It’s rare that
you go an entire off-season without
hearing about the Dallas Cowboys’
starting quarterback, but this sum-
mer, news on Romo was pretty much
nonexistent. The reason is probably
a combination of the fact that Romo

has never been that good and that 4‘

nobody really likes the Cowgirls.
After a broken collarbone ended
what was turning into a mediocre

‘season last year, Romoonly needs
‘ one more forgettable year to fall into

NFL oblivion. Nothing would make
me happier.

Deseanjackson — I know what
you’re thinking. Jackson rounds out
a list of three guys who all played in
the NFC East last season, and three
guys any Redskins fan would hate.
But for Jackson, it’s more than just
that. I knowjackson is good. Despite
some of the inexplicably dumb deci-
sions he’s made on the ﬁeld, I almost

factors in that aspectiof our game.”

Zitzke, the starting setter, earned _13 aces,
on the weekend, an ‘ Acton added seven
of her own.  ,

According to Rens, Yeazel’s play in the
Rhodelsland match was critical to the Pan-
thers’ victory. After dropping the second set
to the Rams, the Panthers adjusted their

lineup and Yeazel was broughtin to play in '
_ the opposite attacking position.

“Bringing Kate in and moving Kiesha
to middle blocker was just the change we
needed-to get back on track and take the
ﬁnal two sets from Rhode Island,” Rens

 said. “Kate showed great poise and effort

coming in from the bench and I was happ
with the results.” ‘

 

rience was also a way for the team to grow
in conﬁdence. A

“For a lot of the freshmen — and even
some upperclassmen — the ﬁrst weekend
of play can cause some jitters,” Acton said.
“Pulling together as a team and earning
four victories showed that we have come a
long wayand that all the younger players
deserve the complete conﬁdence we have
in their abilities.”
_ In addition to their play on the court,
Rens was equally impressed with the ability
of the freshman class to adjustto the higher

‘level of volleyball competition.

“The most important thing the new play-
ers can do is maintain their mental focus on

‘the court,” Rens said. “I think we did that

this weekend and it shows in our record.”
The Panthers will look to sustain that
level of intensity as they prepare to host
some of the nation’s best teams — including
the defending national champions, the Penn
State Nittany Lions —— in next weekend’s

I love Ray Lewis. I love swagger. But Harrison,
somewhere, crossed the line in my eyes. I think
what bothers me most about him is what he
does to a franchise like the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers. Harrison has been the only guy other than ""
Rashard Mendenhall to open his mouth in an
idiotic-enough way to tarnish the Rooney fam-
ily’s reputation for ﬁnding players with good
character. After his bashing his All—Star quar-
terback, the NFL commissioner, Mendenhall,
the dynasty that is the New England Patriots,
Rodney Harrison and Tedy Bruschi, I just can’t
listen to this guy anymore. The moment may
never come, but I’d pay to see a guy like Mau-
rice Jones-Drew lower his shoulder and plow
Harrison. 3

“Her cloming in here with the accolades that '1

She’s had us come up early and had us working -

According to Chin, having Rutledge on stall’ i
gives midﬁelders and forwards a great mentor: _‘

_ “She knows what it takes to be successful at '

, “She’s doinga really good job relayingthat to

Pitt ﬁnished 13th in the Big East in goals per

. game (1.o5)'last season.

In early action this year, the Panthers scored

‘ twice in an exhibition win at home against Saint

Francis and posted two more goals in the regular-
season home opener -— a 2-2 tie with Eastern
Michigan —. before Ohio shut them out in their
ﬁrstroadgame. V , by A
As the team is two weeks into a three-month‘
season, Rutledge’s coaching role will have room
to expand as time progresses —— like that of fel-

But for now, Chin is glad to have someone with
Rutledge’s pedigree on board to work with the ,
offense. _ _ ‘

“Her coming up here: coming to a_Big East
program as a ﬁrst-time assistant is pretty big,
but it says a lot about her and her playing experi-
