Arrival survivors

. DAVID w. TURNER

Erin Brachlow, through no fault of her own, could not
figure out where Holland Hall was Friday afternoon.

A sophomore transfer student from Villanova
University, Brachlow and ‘her mother wandered into the
right group of people — three young adults wearing bright
orange shirts ‘standing in the middle of the Schenley
Quadrangle, just waiting to help.

The three Arrival Survival volunteers offered their
knowledge of the University and any other kind of assis-
tance to help new students and their families efficiently
move into on-campus and property management facilities.
Over a period of four days, they worked without pay simply
out of the kindness of their hearts.

Well, maybe there was one perk.

“Moving in early was a good beneﬁt, too,” adrriitted
sophomore Stephanie Papadoplos from her perch on an
island next to the University Book Center. .

Tired from her 6 1/2 hour-long drive from Middleton,
N.J., Brachlow asked, for some help from the team of
Papadoplos, senior Emily Grisolia and senior Todd Bost.
Grisolia obliged and helped them unload some things from
her car. Before they left, they put a bunch of the baskets and
boxes on a cart that she brought from home. On top of the
load rested a New York Giants pillow, waiting for a new
home.

Grisolia walked them in to Holland Hall, and instructed

Pitt warns students     Night of lanterns and Panthers  

THE PITl' NEWS
Staff Report

Crime alert signs hung on doors leading to all campus
residences this weekend warned freshmen, as well as retum-
ing students, of a recent string of rapes in the eastern parts
of the city and nearby suburbs, including Oakland.

Four rapes have been reported, and while the matter is
currently under investigation, police believe one man may _
be responsible for all of the attacks. V

While one attack did occur in Oakland, it was not on
University property. Still, Pitt police encourage students to
take necessary precautions. V

0 Don’t let strangers inside. your building or your. room.

- Never prop doors open, even for a short time. .

Freshmen men wait to be pinned at the sixth annual Night of the Panther.

Night of the Panther

SHANNON McLAUGHLIN
News Editor

Nearly 175’ freshmen men were
sitting under the iron gates of the
Cathedral of Learning, waiting to be
pinned as they took part inthe sixth
annual Night of the Panther ceremo-
ny. .
The evening began in the

Ballroom in the William Pitt Union, ‘

where the men gathered for the short
procession to the Cathedral. They‘
were met by Director of Student
Activities Joe Cavalla, who was
handing out programs. ,
Cavalla joked with the men of
the class of 2004 about meeting the

women of the freshmen class who -

were then taking part in the annual
Lantern Night ceremony, as they
assembled in pairs.

“I like you guys already,” he
said, as they laughed. A ‘

Larry “Vinnie”. Dailey, a fresh-
man from Gibsonia, Pa., explained
why he had come for the ceremony.
“Free food and girls,” he said.

Charlie Kresge agreed. “There”

are maybe‘ 250 guys in [the
Ballroom], and there are like 5,000
girls out there,” he said. ,
Freshmen men were notified of
the ceremony by mail, and many res-
ident assistants encouraged their
charges to attend. Mike Unangst

brought 10 of the 11 freshmen from 1

his ﬂoor in Lothrop Hall. .

“This is so much fun,” he said.
The senior took part in Night of the
Panther his freshman year, and has
attended ever since.

The men processed from the
Union to the Cathedral as the Pitt
Band Herald Trumpets played out-
side of the Cathedral. Police stopped

traffic on Bigelow Boulevard in
front of the Cathedral so the parade
of khakied and dress-shirted men
could pass, uninterrupted. »

The Pitt Men’s Glee Club sang I

while the men filed into the com-

’ mons area.

Lee Patouillet, the associate vice
chancellor for alumni relations and
executive director of the Pitt Alumni-
Association, congratulated the men
on joining the tradition of Night’ of
the Panther. He also reminded them

right away that they were Panthers, .

and that they had a rivalry to uphold.

\“For those of you who watched
football this afternoon, there’s at
small school in the middle of the
state that now has one loss.”

Jen Smith, president of Pitt’s
Blue and Gold Society, spoke next,
with a few tips for the freshmen.

“Become a leader,‘ not a,fol1ow-
er,” she said. “Decide to become
somebody, and not just anybody.”

She offered, “[Pitt] can be .a
place where you take classes, or a
home away from home.”

The highlight of the evening was

the actual pinning ceremony, during ,

which men processed to the stage,
set up in the middle of the normally
quiet commons room, where admin-
istrators, ‘including Cavalla and
Donham, fastened Panther pins on
them, symbolizing “the strength and
beauty of our community, its build:
ings and traditions.” V
Each man also signed a. guest
book,’ kept by Cavalla, which has
been signed by every freshman man
attending the Night of the Panther
ceremony since its inception in
1995. '

The stained-glass walls of Heinz

The women sat shoulder to shoul-

The event, a University tradition
since 1920, was hosted by the

nearly 450 freshman women attended 4

Pitt welcomes women

of the chapel as well as seats in the

_balcony to watch. their daughters and

granddaughters light their symbolic
lanterns. .

As the young women fanned g_

themselves with programs,

-Chancellor Mark Nordenberg spoke

of the ceremony’s meaning and the
women behind it.

“In 1895 Pitt admitted its first
undergraduate women, Margaret and
Stella Stein. They went on to _lead
their class and Margaret received a
master’s, the first granted to a woman
at the University,” Nordenberg said.

“The lanterns symbolize a new_

beginning, the power to see and to
pursue knowledge and truth.”

I Betty Jane McWilliams was the
2000 Distinguished Alumna and the
keynote speaker. McWilliarris spoke
to the women about the first lantern

recipients during the 1920s.

“Back then, they were on the
threshold of great changes,”
McWilliams said. “They had just
been granted the right to vote and
now it seems many take it for grant-
ed.”

“At that time, they knew very few
four-letter words and their songs
were seldom raunchy,” McWilliams
said. ' . 1

She emphasized that there was-

more to higher education than jus
academics. . ’

“You must accept yourself and
develop personal values, You must
discover ' passions . to protect and
defend,” she said. “And you must
find personal courage to stand for

what you believe. May you always__

hold your lanterns high.”
Diane Murphy, the chair of ithe
Lantern Night Committee, then invit-

ed the ﬂame bearers —— distinguished A

alumnae — to share the light with the
freshmen. . -

“Use the light to illuminate your
path to find your place at Pitt,”
Murphy said. y

“The speech was witty and had a
lot of class,” said Megan Johnston, a
freshman from St. Thomas, Pa. “I

don’t. feel as overwhelmed with the ‘

whole experience, and I think I do
want to get involved with some orga~'
nizations on campus.” I -'
“Her comparisons were funny,
and they made me think,” said Susan
Augello from Pittston, Pa. “Pitt is
really well-organized with the fresh-
man orientation. I’ve enjoyed it a lot,
and I’ve been able to meet a lotof
people, including people from near

rmy hometown.” . A
After the lighting of the lanterns, I

the women walked over to the com-
mons area to join the men —e after

- their Night of the Panther‘ ceremony

—— for refreshments.

University’s new vice provost and
dean of students,» delivered the
freshman address, encouraging the
men to act as “true” panthers.

“All of us are real Pittsburgh

Panthers,” she said. “We have high -

expectations of
Panthers.”

She also advised the freshmen to
go to class, and to build strong
bonds, improving social skills with
“interpersonal relationships.”

“We will ask that you know who
you are — not who you think you
want to be,” she said. “Become what
you’re capable of becoming.”

emony over to the co—ed reception

also taking place in the commons
room after the Night of the Panther
ceremony, Donham took the podium
to lead the class in_the University
alma mater, and to remind the gen-
tlemen of what was waiting outside.

Waiting outside in the warm
spring-like evening were nearly 450
freshmen women.

“Developing those interpersonal
relationships ...” Johnson chimed in.

“And that means at the highest
level, fellas,” Donham said. “We’re
Pitt Panthers, but we’re not always
on the prowl.”

But Dailey and Kresge were.
They were on the prowl for a pen to
capture phone numbers.

T.J. Allen was, too. “It was
alright,” he said of the ceremony.
“Especially what came after.”

be safe but not paranoid

When students arrived in Oakland
last week, many noticed the crime
alerts that the University had placed
near the entrances of all residence halls
and campus apartment buildings.

Thesecrimealertsstatedthatfourrapes
recently occuned in the area, and

police believed one man was responsi-

ble for all of them.‘ Quite obviously,

these facts are alarming to most stu-
dents as well as their parents. '
It is unfortunate that such a Wam-

ing had to become a requisite part of

the welcome that freshmen and return-
ing students received upon their arrival.

It certainly is critical, though, that stu-
dents and their parents take these crime
alerts seriously. Pittsburgh is a big city,

and for many, living in an urban area
comes as a new experience.
Tragically, rapes do occur on our

campus, in our city and in this society.
Women and men alike should thus be

sure to take all possible measures to
avoid this happening to them.
Practicing good common sense and
becoming well-versed in basic self
defense are important skills for any stu-
dent to possess. .
Thankfully, the University has
taken the initiative to ensure that the
student body is informed about these
recent crimes. It is commendable that
Pitt has been willing to call attention to
the rapes in this way, rather than ignore
or downplay such facts in the name of

presenting Pitt as a falsely secure
utopia .

What we must make sure not to
do, however, is let our awareness
morph into paranoia. Parents should
not have to toss and tumjworrying
about safety or second—guess sending
their children here. Our residence halls
are among the most secure of. any
school, as any dorm resident who has
swiped his or her card urnpteen times
and suffered the hassle of . signing in
guests can attest to. ‘

In recent years, the University has
done more to increase safety, including

_ installing newidentity card swipers in

the Forbes Craig Apartments as a pro-
totype for other property management
buildings. Additionally, Pitt has invest-
ed in installing more lighting in various
areas in and around campus.
Furthermore, the University has
around 300 emergency call boxes scat-
tered across campus. " Pittsburgh
itself is a relatively safe city, and a city

with much to -offer culturally and»

socially. People should go out and par-
take of these beneﬁts. Although crime
does occur, we should not allowit to

keep us from enjoying our four (or ~

more) years of college, years that some

call the most enjoyable of our lives. By 1 .

taking some common-sense security
precautions, we can take in all of what
Pittsburgh has to offer, and ‘experience
it in safety.

-Freshmen   are people too 

Every new year ‘brings with it a new
batch of freshmen (and freshwomen). A lot
of them are people who, just a short while
ago, decided to embark on a_ journey from

the safety of home to the.dangerously excit-

ing world of the university. And though their

parents and friends and teachers told them all .

that the transition would be diffi-
cult, only a few have fully under-
stood the reality of this lifestyle
shift. .
Consider the members of the
freshman class for a moment.
Each one does not really know -
what is going on at any given ‘time. They
cannot read a bus schedule, understand a

complicated assignment or find a party on a

regular basis. Once idealized, their sense of

self—reliance is now tested from new and

challenging directions. ,

I can remember the first weeks at college
as one of the most formative experiences in
my life. It was an emotional roller coaster,

. complete with sharp social turns, steep drops

in self-confidence and a Roman-style vomi-

~ torium. .

Pitt. is a great placein terms of the won-
derful-people I got a chance to share my life

with. And these people include upperclass- .
p men. -

Upperclassmen can be big and scary to
freshmen, like a mix of the Jolly Green Giant

' and Christopher Walken. They can be big or

smart or confident enough to not really care
to noticethe newbies; but they might crush
people by mistake. And a lot of them talk

’ There’s a spirit of disregard that every

upperclassmen seems to gain as_ soon as they '

find a satisfaction with their knowledge of
the college system. And with this self-indul-
gent conﬁdence comes a general contempt
for the people who do not know where their
classes are or cannot ﬁnd a party on the

weekend or cannot, set up their e—mail

accounts. . .
Maybe contempt is too strong a word for
the general unwillingness that upperclass-

men possess when it comes to paying atten-
tion to the thoughts or troubles of the
younger students. It is a sort of inability to
accept an infusion of new ideas because the
messengers are younger, naive and inexperi-
enced. Some freshmen are jerks and deserve
this treatment for the casual arrogancethey

bring from high school.
rienced interaction with a lot of
freshmen, I can tell you that
most are [gasp] human beings
who deserve empathy. , C
. So, please, give the little
ones »a break before crushing their spirits.

There will be plenty of time to insult their‘

The great debate: to see or to be seen

The luckiest of us are blessed with per-

vision are indeed from Wal-Mart, and they
are indeed ugly. Consequently I am faced

. with the following daily dilemma: to see
J (and see well), or to be seen (and be seen

looking good, or at least, looking better).
Perhaps it sounds ridiculously superﬁ-
cial that this is even a problem for me.
Seeing, after all, is among the most revered
of the ﬁve senses, and appearances are, well,

' just appearances.

ELIZABETH

OPINIONS EDITOR

 

Sadly, I fall into this last category. The _
glasses that I sport to correct my 20/200-

They shouldn’t really matter, but to me
they undoubtedly do. I have good/bad hair
days, clothes days and face days that seern
to run in serr1i—regular cycles, and of this fact
I am absolutely certain: When the stars have
aligned in my favor, when all the aspects of
my appearance have coordinat-
ed themselves well and I think I
am looking relatively good, I
feel better. I am happier, I am
nicer, I do better in school and I
am kinder to animals and small
children. And in this way, appearancesare
rendered more than superﬁcial in their inﬂu-
ence, and they do begin to actually matter.

Hence, the great glasses debate. I will
never look or feel my best when I am wear-
ing those wretched ﬁames, but I will never
be able to see adequately without them.

So Imake my decision —— to see or be
seen ——_ on a situation—b —situation basis.
Sometimes it’s easy_to distinguish my prior-
ity, i.e., seeing for driving, being seen for
parties. ‘ .

But the choice is not always so simple.
For example, class: I’m generally nerd to
the core, - and will not tolerate anything
standing between me and my academics. So
I usually sit near the front of the room and

at the beginning of the semester, when peo-
ple are apt to be ﬁiendlier and chattier and

I’m moreconcemed with making a good

sion — being able to see the detailed carv-
ings on what many call the most perfect
building ever in all of their intricate glory vs.
not looking really dorky in the pictures I

So I did the only reasonable thing I.

could do —I wore the glasses, but momen-
tarily hung them on the V—neck of my shirt
at every photo opportunity.

Iwishlcould saythatintime,Iwill
devise an adequate solution to my problem,
such as undergoing hypnosisto relieve me
of my fear of sticking things in my eyes and

thus liberating me to wear contacts.‘

Unfortunately that will not happen; I still
struggle with the glasses dilemma, but it is
getting better. ' V

A blessing in disguise occurred when I
accidentally sat on my glasses in India —-I
had carelessly tossed them on my bed after

was 82 times better than it was at the Wal-
Mart Vision Center. After numerous try-ons,
I ﬁnally found a nice square pair of tortoise
shell frames. A little big, a little nerdy — but
nerdy in a nerd-chic way instead of just
plain awkward.

So I’m going to try to have the best of
both worlds this semester. Enjoythe luxury
of 20/20 vision under the guise of my new
frames, and with a few pep talks to myself
and maybe a slightly different hairstyle,
convince myselfthat the new glasses actual-

Strong role models for I black women

A Young people today are
constantly bombarded with
audio and visual images. To a
degree, when a young person

, sees or hears recurrent repre-

sentations of individuals who
share his or her gender and
ethnicity, those images can
have a powerful inﬂuence on
his .. or her developing self-
image. ' -/"
Living ‘ in Wilkinsburg,

~ Pa., a borough with a large

black. population, this phe-
nomenon concerns me. And as
a community activist, I. am
particularly worried about the

_ negative’ images of black,
’ women that still litter the pop

-culture landscape. From the
evening newscast to the latest
music video, portraits of the
black woman as a victim, a
criminal‘ or a sex object are
hawked to audiences glutto—
nous for degrading stereo-

_ types. These images. are then

readily accessible to the black
girls of my borough.
Censorship of these
images certainly is not the
answer; even the crudest
zmedia pimp has the right to

exploit any, images. he desires V
for his own commercial bene-

ﬁt. Instead, those of us who
care about today’s‘generation
of black girls need to direct.
our eyes toward inspiring and
empowering images of black
female role models. Quite a
few of these role models wear
uniforms. ,
Consider such remarkable
women Rear Adm. Evelyn J.
Fields, director ofthe National
Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration
Commissioned Ofﬁcer Corps.
As head of this uniformed ser-
vice, Fields commands a
diverse body of scientists and

,engineers who serve at duty

stations ranging from Alaska
to Antarctica. Fields began her
NOAA career as a cartograph-
er in 1972. She eventually
took command of the.NOAA
Ship McArtl1ur, making her
the first woman to captain a
U.S. government oceangoirig
vessel. The Senate conﬁrmed
her appointment as top officer
of the NOAA Corps in 1999.
Of course, not all uni-
formed _black women leaders
command ships at sea. As
chief of police for the city of
Atlanta, Beverly Harvard
takes charge of 2,300 police

officers’ and civilian employ-
ees on_ dry land. The chief

ofﬁcer in 1973 hand then

Fields or Harvard in person.
But during my time as an
Army Reservist, I had the
privilege of serving under -tlie
command of a similarly pow-
erful black woman, Col.
Carolyn Entzrriinger. She
became one of my role models
during her tenure as comnian—
der of the 390th Personnel
Group. I remember sitting in
the chow hall at Fort Drum,
N.Y., listening to Entzminger

experiences with my fellow

sometimes worry about them,
as a lot of pitfalls await them
as they come of age.

So I hope that as they
mature, their eyes will turn
toward positive images of
black women instead of the
negative ones. That is why I
have a particular admiration
for Fields, Harvard and
Entzminger. Each of these

women is a leader and a 

teacher who has had a positive
impact within her sphere of
command. And each wears her
distinctive uniform with pride
as she provides young people
of various races and genders
with a powerful role model.

will be most helpful to her?

Helping is easy because experi-
ence is the only thing of which every
upperclassman has plenty to offer.
Even if they never take ‘a personal
interest in helping a speciﬁc person,
upperclassmen can "still make small
differences to improve the general
quality of life for freshmankind.

Subjective knowledge such as
which courses to take, with which
teachers to take them, etc., is almost
impossible-to ﬁnd within the universi-
ty bureaucracy. Yet trial and error can
ruin a’ semester. Freshmen have the
fewest sources for valuable knowl-
edge at a time in their lives where the
lack of such common understandings
can hurt them the most.

While it might weaken the strong
self—reliance that a university builds
by encouraging the able to help out
the ignorant, providing helping hands
to people who might not even realize
they are standing at a precipice seems
justified. Opportunities to trip and fall
should be much more instructional
when a mistake does not lead to the
potential destruction of one’s precari-
ous self-esteem.

in emotio

So you just started here at Pitt and
have all sorts of strange and new emo-
tions running through you. Moving in
was exciting, leaving your parents and
friends was sad and meeting
your new roommate was
interesting.

Well, forget all those
silly emotions. They’ll just
get in the way of what
you’re supposed to be doing here —
getting an education. So, here’s a list of
the emotions you’ll feel over the next
few weeks so you can mentally prepare
yourself and then shrug them off for a
few studious hours at the library.

Week one: Anxiety. What else
could you feel, knowing that you have

to worry about such important matters
as getting hit by mass—transit buses, fail-
ing classes and making friends? Your
first week of anxiety may be touched
with euphoria after your
parents leave, but you’ll still
be calling them once a week
for the rest of the semester.
Weeks two and three:
Curiosity. Realizing that
the Ethernet connection probably isn’t
going to go away any time soon, you’ll
soon recognize the inherent beauty of
South Oakland and its inhabitants. After
that, you’ll want to go ahead and get on
a random bus and see where it takes
you. Everybodyiat Pitt has a Bus Story,
so you might as well work on getting

yours as soon as possible. A Bus Story
is an epic adventure on public trans-

portation, usually involving a well—laid

plan and three hours of waiting at a bus
stop on the outskirts of Pittsburgh.
Weeks three and four: Confusion.
So when you were at one of those hop-
ping South Oakland parties, somebody

told you that midtenns weren’t that hard »

and there’s a thing called a curve. You’ll
be lost for a while trying to ﬁgure out
the curve thing. Here’s a hint: No curve
is ever greater than two percentag
points. -
Weeks five and six: Loneliness.
Having fun e—mailing your high school
friends every day? Feel like going home
for homecoming? Well, off you’ll go, to

tell them about how much you can
drink and how stupid your college
friends are. Here’s another hint: Taking
the bus literally stinks, and the train
goes a lot slower than you’d think. The
good thing about being home is the free
food and drink. And while you may be
tempted to reimburse your‘ parents
when they make dinner, don’t.

Weeks seven and eight:
Frustration and anger. Apparently
cramming for those exams didn’t work
and you made the low end of the curve
in most of your classes. What you prob-

ably shouldn’t do is check your syllabus ’

at this time — you’ll find that one exam
makes up for- 40 percent of your grade.
But you’ll check anyway and then
begin rationalizing the rest of the term,
making false promises to yourself.
You’ll also find that you’ll need 150
percent on the rest of the exams to get
an A in the class.
\ Weeks nine and ten: Apathy. Who
needs school, really? You’ve got a com-
puter, a small fridge and a large meal
plan. Forget class. There’s sleeping and
playing video games. And talking! Who
knew that talking to your roommates
would last until 3 a.m.? Your roommate
also has a CD burner, so you’ll have to
download all those MP3s and make all
those CDs before you go on winter
break. Also, there’s snow outside! Grab
a tray and head over to Schenley Park
for hours of irresponsible fun.

Weeks 11 and 12: Pitifuli crying.
Calling your parents and telling them

you lost your scholarship won’t be the
_ easiest , thing. So you should start

preparing yourself for it; Share with
your parents the false promises you
made to yourself. They may be oddly

comforting to hear again. A ,

. Not only will you also be in the
hole in most of your classes, but you’ll
find others doing many more produc-
tive things and making you feel useless.
After hitting that low, your parents will
tell you about your friends in other col-.
leges who are much more successful

and happy than you.‘ Oh, by the way,‘

you should start e-mailing them again.
End of term: Desperation; Time
to re—evaluate your role in life. Maybe
you shouldn’t have come to college or
maybe you should have gone some-

place else, someplace with all of your

friends. Maybe they would have
encouraged you to study and not let you
waste away for weeks at a time. Maybe
your ‘ parents and friends will under-
stand your grade point average, which
is about half of what it was in high
school. It’s OK though, you’ll do better
next semester — now that all the party-

ing is gone and nobody e-mails you,

anymore. -

Lessons learned in off-campus housing

In every college student’s life, the day
comes when he or she feels the need to ﬂee
the safety and convenience of the dorms for
the promised land of olT—campus housing.
For me, this day was last Sunday. In one
short week, living here has taught me a great
deal of useful infonnation. 7

During the ﬁrst day or so here, my
biggest grudge was with the toilet First, the
tank lid is a completely different shape from
the rest of the tank. How could that have
made sense when it was rr1ade?It’s beyond
me. Yet that I could handle.

The thing didn’t work right, either.
Therefore, I learned a little about plumbing.
You don’t think about how the toilet works
until it doesn’t. Ours just ﬂushed continu-

ously for an hour. In a dorm, maybe this is
something I would have thought was funny.
In a place where I’m paying the water bill,
it’s not funny. So I did what any self-respect-
ing college senior would do at
11:30 at night when the toilet is
broken.

I called my dad.

I know, I know, I could
have called the landlord, as he -
told me the next day, but I probably will
always have this mental block against calling
people who are not my close friends past 11
at night. But Dad is a person you don’t care
about waking up. That’s what he’s there for.

Talking to my father late at night about
a toilet was not fun, though. Dads are just not

to do to ﬁx it. I must say I was pretty proud .

 

  

as helpful long—distance. When he told me
I’d have to take the lid oﬂ°-the tank, I almost
died. I had no idea what I might potentially
see in there.

But it wasn’t as bad as my
active imagination made it out
to be. Slimy_ and discolored,
yes; dirty and horrible, no. But
with the help of Dad, I learned
how our toilet worked and what

of myself. I chalked it up as one more step
toward not being one of those dumb, help-
less girls. ‘ 1 ’

It.wasn’t even 24 hourslater when I
leamed my next important lesson‘. This les-
son was that one person’s trash can be anoth-

   

.,

punos punoiins

er’s useful household item. Walking through
our (empty) living room I spotted an enter-
. taimnent center outside on the curb, seem-
ingly abandoned by its previous owner.
Recruiting my roommate to take a look at it,
we ventured outside to the sidewalk, a flight-
ening place to be on the eve of garbage day.
We felt a little silly combing through the

trash, but this thing was just perfect for our I

virtually cabinet—less kitchen (there are six
people in our house, and we accumulate a
vast quantity of food). ,

Do we take it? Do you think they still
want it? Is it acceptable to just take,the
trash? These were among questions repeat-
edly tossed back and forth as we contem-
plated rescuing the old shelves. We ﬁnally
decided, after asking the person hauling stuff
out of the house next door if it was OK, to
bring it in. .

So my roommate and I went to work
caning a massive, heavy wooden object into
our kitchen. After 10 minutes of shuﬂling
and cursing, the abandoned entertainment
center was ours. , '

That wasn’t the end of the ordeal. I .
,_ mean, we didn’t know where ithad been. It

demanded cleaning, with powerful disinfec-
tants. After the thing had been brought to an
’ acceptable level of cleanliness, and ﬁlled
‘ with food, we gazed approvingly at the for-
mer trash once again serving a purpose.
 The most recent important thing I have
learned is how to deal with gas appliances. I
come from a land where everything is elec-
tiic, so this concept is completely foreign to
me. The moming during which everyone
took cold showers introduced us to the prob-
lem of the hot water heater’s pilot light bum-
ing out. .' ~ '

Looking at the hot water heater, I dis— ._
covered instructions. Banking on the theory

ﬂnat I am a reasonably intelligent person who
should be able to follow directions, I decid-
ed to attempt the re-lighting of the pilot light
myself. I followed every instruction; howev-

er, the instructions fail to inform you as to

what exactly you should be ﬁghting. , .
,_ To make a long story short, I couldn’t

get the thing to light and felt rather stupid

about it I broke down, went against my no-

asking—for-help nature and called the land- ,
lord,,who came to Vre—light it I watched as he .
did it though, and next time,I’1l know how to y

do it myself. ‘

My next lesson will be parallel ‘parking, _

as I am bringing my beloved car back after
Labor Day. Parking on the streets of Oakland
is probably not the brightest thing in the
world to do, seeing as how I do like the car,
but I’m willing to try. This car-less thing just
does not work for me. I am sure, though, that
this will not be the lastthing I learn.

Certainly, astheyearwears on, livinginc

Meet Sally and Shane — a tale of two freshmen  

There’s something amusing about
watching the freshmen pile into Oakland at
the beginning of every school year, trying
to put distance between themselves and
their parents.

The people who are being cast away
like rejects are the same ones who dish out
the money, who would do anything to keep
their kids’ dreams alive.

Yes, the orientation and move-in
process can be quite amusing to those who
have seen it year after year after year after...

I will start with those of the female
sex, because as the rule goes, men do not
understand women.

Sally’s 
Hordes of girls, age 17 to 19, make

their way onto campus, but Sally thinks
she is every fratemity guy’s dream.

The thing is, Sally has not yet been to
a fraternity party. But nonetheless, her only
goal for the ﬁrst two weeks of classes is to
hook up with a guy from a fraternity, have
sex with the guy, join a sorority if need be
and brag about it to her 1ess—fortImate, fia-
temity boy-less friends. _-

She exits, the back seat of her parents’
Honda Accord, wearing a very revealing
light blue tank top and a .tight skirt that
hangs just below her butt

As her parents pull items of furniture

V and boxes out of the car, Sally grabs a

backpack and the smallest suitcase she
brought and heads up to Tower B, leaving
her parents wondering where she disap-

peared to. When Sally and her parents find
each other, it is the daughter who is upset,
wondering where her guardians went.

While Mom and Dad are sweating in
the hot Oakland sun, Sally wants to look
good for whoever else may be

moving in tons of fI1rnitI1re at BRAD
CUPRIK

that time.

Sally is more concerned
about which ‘N Sync member
she’ll hang on her wall ﬁrst,
and is not paying attention to her father,
who is stumbling down the hallway with
Sally’s vanity needs, three suitcases and
computer.

, She forces her parents to depart quick-
ly. Then she ﬁnds a small, dark comer off
of Forbes Avenue, looks around nervously,

gives each of them a peck on the cheek and
pushes her mother away, breaking free
from the “I’m never letting you go” grip.

Sally is too busy discussing which fra-
ternity has the cutest guys with her room-
mate, Ashlieqgh ( the “q” is
silent), to realize that classes
start in two days and she has"
yet to purchase textbooks.

After calling‘ and com-
plaining to her parents about
how much books cost, she’ is given an extra
credit card or two and quickly stocks up on
new revealing outﬁts to wear at parties.

If a freshman wants to get lucky with
a guy, it is essential to get it done the first
weekend after classes start.

Girls really do not have to be lucky to
get lucky, as Sally ﬁnds out, because there
are plenty of vultures in Oakland.

Shane’s story

Shane is a freshman v111ture. He fol— .

lows all the latest fads He has a good body

and claims it has to" do with the 15 varsity ‘T

sports he competed in during his four years

I in high school.

The thing is, that’s all Shane is — a
body. He has no school smarts. He’ll strug-
gle with the whole “going to class” thing
and post a 1.24 GPA heading into his
sophomore year.

He doesnot care, however, because as
long as he hooks up with as many babes as
he can, he’ll be happy.

That way, he can brag to all of his
friends and become even more popular.

Why does this work, you ask?

Because boys like Shane take advan-

‘ tage of the system. and girls like Sally
‘allow it. ‘ .
As I look around campus again this

August, it is easy to see that it keeps getting
worse. Most freshmen are fake.

They put on acts and change their per— -

sonalities in the blink of an eye. The sweet,
intelligent girl that got through high school
with good grades and a senior prom date
that her parents loved as much as she did
slowly transforms into someone who talks
more about Friday night’s party, than she
does about that test she managed to get a D
on. S‘ -

There are no solutions in sight, so my
complaint may be in vain. I am all for hav-

T ing a good time, but those same good times

got me sidetracked from what I came. to
college to do. Learn from a venerable vet-

. eran like myself.

If you’re going to be fake, do it, but

know the right time to morph back into a .

student. Plus, do not be pissed off when I
continue making comments about your
behavior. q

Have frm and heed this simple advice
about the ﬁrst weekend after classes start.

Bring rationality to the gun control debate

Now that the Million Mom March is
several months behind us, perhaps it is
time to take an honest, statistical look at
gun control. After all, the march

increased the usually high
level of emotion surrounding
the topic, a policy realm
where logic takes a back seat
to rhetoric and propaganda

from both sides. ‘

Gun control proponents ‘rely on
heart-rending stories of victims of gun
violence, individuals who deserve our
sympathy. Meanwhile, they characterize
their opponents as “gun nuts” and “right-
wing extremists” and, according to a New
York Times description, “doomsday
cults” and “Montana freemen.”

Gun rights advocates are no better, as
they readily counter that their opponents
are “gun-grabbers” and “muddled moms”
and also make references to gun control
laws in Nazi Germany; this, however,
only increases the public perception of
them as, well, gun nuts.

Amid such terminology, we lose
focus of the actual facts. The National
Riﬂe Association and their allies over-
look the fact that that guns indeed do kill
people, and far too often. Something
should be done to work to decrease gun
violence. Meanwhile, Handgun Control
Inc. and their allies overlook the research
behind’ gun control legislation —-— a record

       

  

showing loudly and clearly that their

only

approach is wrong-headed.
Our most recent example comes
from Australia, a country where gun con-

trol laws have been in place for only over .

, _' ayear. Inthe first 12 months

‘i _ following passage of the leg-
islation, after authorities
conﬁscated hundreds of
thousands of personal
‘ firearms, homicides
increased 3.2 percent, assaults increased
8.5 percent and armed robberies went up
a whopping 44 percent after a 25-year

, decrease.

In the United States, gun ownership
has increased considerably throughout
the 1990s, despite the media’s attempt to
have you believe only fringe lunatics own
guns. Yet both violent crime and overall
crime fell for most of the decade. If gun
ownership did lead to violence, we would
see the reverse. L

Professor John Lott Jr., after review-
ing the data for 20 years from across this
country, found that safe-storage laws did
not reduce the number of suicides or acci-
dental gun deaths. Instead, the 15 states
that implemented such laws had more
burglaries, 300 more murders per year
and 3,800 more rapes per year. Where are
the feminist groups who should be oppos-
ing such rape-increasing laws?

Not only do gun control laws
increase the level of violence, but laws
allowing concealed weapons decrease

crime rates. If we should be passing new
legislation, it should increase citizens’
access to guns, not decrease it. We need
laws that will deter criminals by allowing
Americans to defend themselves more
easily.

While gun laws are not always a bad
idea, we should instead do what most
Americans desire in regards to such laws:
We should enforce the already-existing
laws. Recent polls have found that only
29 percent want new gun laws whereas
68 percent want stronger enforcement of
the laws already on the books. Gun con-
trol groups and gun rights groups both
agree with the majority of Americans on
this issue, though gun rights groups
fought these laws when they were initial-
ly proposed. , .

Not only is this an idea that promotes
unity, but it works! In Richmond, Va., the
murder rate quickly fell once law
enforcement ofﬁcials agreed to back
existing rules that penalize gun-toting
criminals. V

Is it any wonder that scholars have
altered their views when studying the
issue? Many have begun, reviewing the
issue believing they would find data
favoring gun control laws, but after look-
ing more closely at the controversy have
concluded that we do not need new gun
laws if we’re concerned about citizen

safety. One does not hear of the reverse

scenario ever taking place.

I know my views certainly changed
once I began looking at the facts. Those
facts speak loudly and clearly —— while
gun ownership causes some violence and
crime, the overall effect is that violence
and crime decreases because of the deter-
rent effect of gun ownership.

Not only is it a logical, fact-based
approach, but it is the legal way to pro-
ceed, especially here in Pennsylvania.
While the Second Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution does have open room for
reinterpretation (it specifies that gun
rights exist only because a militia is need-
ed, and many would argue we do not
need a militia in this day and age),
Pennsylvar1ia’s constitution is blunt and
to the point: “The right of the citizens to
bear arms in defense of themselves and
the State shall not _be question .”

The Democrats, by backing more
and more gun control laws, continue to
abandon their roots as the party of the
people. With their increasing social liber-
alism and economic conservatism, they
abandon their populist history. They have
already lost the House and the Senate
under this “New Democrat” ideology.
Wﬂl they keep abandoning their base
until they lose the presidency in addition
to their souls?

Mischa Gelman wonders why a bright
guy such as Ralph Nader is on the wrong
side of the issue.

Pitt’s women’s soccer team began
its season over the weekend with-a pair
of games against non—conference foes.
In Friday evening’s game, the Panthers
squeaked by Air Force, but on Sunday,

the Panthers could not -get the offense

Richmond goalkeeper Kristen
Samuhel in a 1-0 loss.

Pitt 3, Air Force 2

The Panthers opened the 2000 sea-
son with a solid performance in a vic-
tory over the Falcons.

“We played as well as we could
have,” Pitt head coach Roland Sturk
said. “But I don’t get overly excited

‘Pitt had some good scoring

chances early in the game. Cande Ruiz .

sent a cross to freshman Emily Tipton
that was blocked by the defense about
ﬁve minutes into the game. I

A few minutes later, Air Force
midﬁelder Billie Rothwell took a pass

    

shot from close range, and Ruiz got the
rebound but could not put the ball in
the back of the net.

Falcons forward Beth Boyer then
had a penalty kick that was tipped over
the top of the net by Pitt goalie Rachel
Brown. On the ensuing corner kick,
Boyer sent the ball toward the net and
freshman midfielder Erica Palmer
headed it in the goal to give Air Force
the 1-0 advantage at the 21:54 mark.

Pitt almost evened the game up
when Melissa Smith blasted a shot

‘from the top of the box, but Air Force

goalie Kristy Kuhlman made a diving
stop. Just a few minutes later, Smith
headed the ball wide-of the net.

About 15 minutes after Palmer
gave the Falcons the lead, she was
involved in another play that changed
the game. After Pitt midﬁelder Katrina
Shibata shot a ball past‘ Kuhlman,’
Palmer stopped the ball at the goal line
with her hand. She was given a red
card for the infraction, and Shibata

consequently ‘converted the penalty I

The ideal situation for the Pitt football team would
be complete health, several Big East victories and con-
tinuing development of younger players. V,

Only the third may be in store for the 2000 squad
because of several key injuries that may keep some
players on the mend.

In the first of two preseason intrasquad scrim-
mages at Three Rivers Stadium, wide receiver Latef
Grim hurt his ankle trying to catch an under-thrown
pass by John Turman in the end zone.

Grim appeared to be seriously injured, but X-rays
were negative and it was diagnosed as a sprained
ankle. Originally, he was to miss Pitt’s home opener
against ‘Kent State, but he retumed to practice on
Saturday.

Grim said that head coach Walt Harris would make
a decision later in the week as to whether he’ll play.

“Anytime you lose a player of his caliber for any
period of time, it hurts your rhythm in practice,” said
David Priestley, who will be vying with Turman for the

In his absence, Lamar Slade appeared to be next on
the depth chart but redshirt freshman Chris Curd has
played well and‘ received time with the first-team
offense in the second scrimmage. ,

Both Grim and Bryant were named to the
Biletnikoff Award watch list. The award is presented

er. ’

Harris said that he is waiting for either Priestley or
Turman to make the decision for him as to who will be’
under center on Saturday. E ’ .

Harris had the same dilemma last year, but used

both quarterbacks in Pitt’s first two games.

“Neither player has separated himself from the
other,” Harris said. “Both have done well, and, obvi-
ously, David is a little bit behind "because he missed
spring practice.”

Priestley also missed the last two games of the
1999 season and had off-season surgery to heal liga-
ments in his throwing shoulder. ‘

As the 2000 football season
approaches, the Big East Conference is
celebrating its 10th anniversary.

Over this time, the league has seen
Miami win a national championship
and West Virginia have an undefeated
season.

Just last year, Virginia Tech made a
run for a national title. ,

The teams that will take the field
this year, however, are quite different
than those of the early ‘90s.

Here is a look at the Big East teams

Pitt will be competing against this sea-

‘ son and the key players who will have

the greatest impact.

Boston College (8-4 overall, 4-3 Big
East last season) . .
Boston College has 13, starters
returning from the team that earned the
Eagles an appearance at the
Insight.com Bowl last year. T h e
offense will _be led by senior running
back Cedric Washington, whose aver-
age of 102 rushing yards per game in
1999 earned him All—Big East First
Team honors. «
- His 1,122 yards last season were
the 10th most in the nation and allowed

Washington to become the 13th 1,000-

yard rusher in the school’s history.

the top recruiting classes in the country

ing The Sporting News and Athlon.

Miami’s offense includes a group _ -

led by sophomore Clinton Portis: He
set a Miami‘ freshman mark with 838
rushing yards and added eight touch‘-

~ downs in 10 games.

Portis will be joined by senior-_
James Jackson, whose 782 yards rush-

ing earned him a spot on the All—Big
I East Second team. ’

American candidate Santana Moss. As

starter, Kenny Kelly, left school to pur- ~

sue a professional baseball career.

_ The Houston Astros were supposed
to be one of the top teams in baseball
this year. Three—time defending
National League Central division
champions, _the Astros were supposed
to go to the next level this year.

_ The team had a new home, Enron
Field, that was much more fan—friendly
than the Astrodome, and with_ the added
off-theefield success of the new park

. combined with the on-the-field success

of the team in recent years, nothing
could go wrong. Or could it? /
Well, apparently it could, because
the Astros are dueling with the
Pittsburgh.Pirates for the worst record
in Major League Baseball. And if you
want to know the reason why, look no
further than your wallet. Money. That’s
Houston’s biggest problem. '
But the problem isn’t lack of
money. While the Astros don’t have an

astronomical payroll like the New York

Yankees or the Los Angeles Dodgers,
they do have a decent amount of money
for payroll. Houston’s biggest problem
is that the Astros’ front office is as good
with its money as Dylan McKay was
with his trust fund back in Beverly
Hills. ' '
Look at who the Astros have lost in
the last year. Derek Bell, Mike
Hampton and Carl Everett are just a
few of the big names who left Houston

for fiscal purposes. They were_ all com— -

ing up on their last year before free
agency, so the Astros’ got rid of them.
You don’t suppose that the Astros

. could use Harnpton’s solid pitching, or

Bell’s clutch hitting, or even Everett’s
30 homers and 90 RBIs, do you?

That’s what I thought. On to some
other sports thoughts:

- When the Yankees acquired slug— Y

ger Jose Canseco off of waivers from
Tampa Bay a few weeks ago, everyone
assumed that New York was getting the
designated hitter it really needed.
Well, Yankee fans, it looks like you
got the guy you needed, but not in the
Canseco deal. Glenallen Hill, acquired

V at the trade deadline, has been the"

biggest surprise in New York City since

.Willis Reed’s performance in the 1970

NBA Finals. ‘
’ - I’m not sure, but after watching
the Little League World Series in

‘Williamsport, Pa., this weekend, -I think

that all of the teams_that competed in
the LLWS could have defeated both the
Pittsburgh Pirates and,the Philadelphia
Phillies.

Even if I’m exaggerating a bit on

R that statement, I do think that there is

one thing that the Pirates and Phillies
could learn from the LLWS teams, and
that is teamwork. Winning is about

more than playing well and staying.

For a few current and former mem-
bers of the Pitt men’s swimming team,
the Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia, were no more than a ﬁve-hour
drive away.

That’s because the seven swimmers
competed in the United States Olympic
Swimming Trials, which were held from
Aug. 9-17 in Indianapolis.

Although no Panthers qualiﬁed for a
spot on the Olympic squad, it was a con-
siderable leaming experience, according
to Chuck Knoles, the headacoach of Pitt’s
men’s swirmning team. .

  

  

    
     
   
   
   
   
     
      

 
    

 
   

time in Indianapolis,” Knoles...said. “It’s
all part of their development.”

Redshirt junior Steve Siler turned in
a strong performance, as he competed in
the 100- and 200-meter backstroke
events and placed in the top 40 of both.

The 100 was won by Lenny
Krayzelburg with a time of 53.84 sec-
onds. Siler ﬁnished 38th with a mark of
58.13. ’

In the 200, it was Krayzelburg again
setting the pace for the other swimmers.
His time of 1:57.31 was a record for the
Olympic trials. Siler swam a strong race
to come in 31st in the preliminary swim
with a time of 2:05.85.

“Steve went out and swam wel1,”

Knoles said. “He has nothing to be,

ashamed of.” _ A _

, Pitt junior Miah Heath competed in
the 100-meter butterﬂy, which was won
by Ian Crocker’s trials-record time of
52.78. Heath swam the distance in 56.33.

‘g‘Miah was a little disappointed with
his performance,” Knoles said. “He
thinks he could have done better. He was
a little off of his best-ever time.”

Sophomore Mike Grube competed
in two of the ﬂashiest events, the 50 and
100 freestyle.

V In the 50, Gary Hall won with a U.S.
record time of 21.76. Grube came to the
finish line in 23.78 seconds.

The 100 was more of the same, as
Hall dueled with Neil Walker for the title,
with Walker edging out Hall to win the
race in 48.71. Grube finished in 52.04.

“Mike Grube really improved,”
Knoles said, adding that Grube’s time
was a personal best.

Two of the Panthers expected to
compete in the trials were incoming
freshmen Ken Shellhorse and Randy
Gertenbach. Shellhorse did not go to the
meet, while Gertenbach swam in the 200
breaststroke. ' '

Kyle Salyards won the race in a time
of 2:13.21, while Gertenbach swam a
time of 2:24.50.

“Randy had a disappointing 'swirn,”,

Knoles said, _ while adding that
Gertenbach came up to him after the
group’ had returned to Pittsburgh and
admitted‘ that he was a little apprehensive
during his swiIn._ ‘ .

“Randy came up to me and said
‘Coach, I was really nervous and I’m not
going to do that next time,”’ Knoles said.
“So now I know that he’s already learned
his lesson.”

Three former Pitt stars also swam in
the trials. Brian Elko, who won three
individual Big East titles in his Pitt
career, swam in three events. ’

In the 100 backstroke, Elko came to ~

the line in 57.90, ﬁnishing just ahead of

this former teammate Siler.

one touchdown pass and two intercep-
tions. , .

Turman has been more successful as
he completed 25 of 40 passes for 337
yards, including four touchdowns and
two interceptions.‘

The third—string quarterback, Rod
Rutherford, has also seen time ‘at the
receiver position in the last week of

camp and had ﬁve receptions in the sec- -

ond scrimmage, two for touchdowns,
for a total of 81 yards.

“Rod’s an excellent athlete, and we
want to get him on the ﬁeld,” Harris

A said.

The running game has been suspect,
as projected starter Kevan Barlow con-
tinues to heal from what Harris called

,f‘multiple bruises.”

After gaining just seven yards on

nine carries in the first scrimmage, A

Barlow managed 49 yards on nine
attempts on Wednesday.

Nick Goings-and Torrie. Cox will

give Barlow some rest during games,
although Goings missed the first scrim-
mage with an injury. ’

Top recruit Dustin Picciotti, a fresh-
man fullback from Chalfont, Pa., just
returned to practice on Friday after suf-
fering from post-concussion‘ syndrome.
A day later, he was out again with recur-
ring headaches. 1

Picciotti suffered the initial injury in
the Big 33 Game, a match pitting
Pennsylvania against Ohio high school
all-stars. ‘

The offensive line is battered with
Joe Manganello, Khiawatha Downey

and Bryan Anderson all missing signiﬁ-
_ cant practice time with injuries. ~

Harris has had to_ use true freshman
on the O-line during second—team drills
and the results are not positive, as both
Priestley and Turman were hit hard sev-
eral times in Wednesday’s scrimmage.

On the defensive side of the ball,

All-American candidate Ramon Walker

continues to suffer from a shoulder
injury. Walker returnedto practice on

 Saturday, however, and said he will be

able to play through the pain. It may
take some of the edge away from the

, main strength of the defense a tough

hitting. a ‘ -

“He’s hit a lot of people real hard,”
Harris said- “Right now, he’s hurt and
beat up a little bit.” ‘ .

Walker was named to the Jim
Thorpe Award watch list. ' The Jim

Thorpe Award is presented to the.

nation’s top defensive back.

Another preseason award winner
was linebacker Ryan Gonsales, who was
named to watch list for the Butkus

, Award for the best player in the nation at

his position.
With Gonsales, Amir Purifoy,
Gerald Hayes, ~ Brian Beinecke, Nick

Cole, Kody Miller and former running .
back Brandon Williams all healthy, it is

Harris’ best linebacking corps in" four
seasons.

The defensive line has been hurting,
with Darrell McMurray on crutches for
the second scrimmage. Bryan Knight
and Mike White have also missed time
with minor injuries, and that’s why
Harris moved former linebacker Brian
Guzek to the defensive end position.

“We feel he’s going to get more
playing time at defensive end, and he’s a
guy we want in the lineup,” Harris said.

Pitt will have two games to figure
out who is ready for the grueling season.
‘Games against Mid-American
Conference members Kent State and
Bowling Green will give Harris’ a
chance to_ see players in game situations
and give the injured players time to heal
before the tough part of the Panthers
schedule begins.

GOALIE

Brown, a junior, made four saves in

picking up her first victory, but also A
picked up her first yellow card in

the match.

As an Air Force player broke in
alone on Brown, she ran out of the
goal area and executed a takedown
that most wrestlers would be proud
of. .

Referee John Woodruff was not
impressed and gave Brown the yel—
low card at 32:07 for tripping.

Eleven minutes before the cau-
tion, Brown allowed her first goal
on‘ a crossing pass by Beth Boyer
that Erika Palmer headed into the
net.

“I lost my focus a bit,” said
Brown, “and didn’t really judge the
cross right.” T

After the Panthers rallied to
take a 2-1 lead, the Falcons tied the

game on a blistering shot -from A
Boyer that ﬂew past Brown» into the

corner of the net.

Brown appeared to hurt her
back on the play, diving to makethe
stop. She quickly regained her com-
posure and after the Panthers took
their second ‘lead of the game,
Brown made an interesting stop in
the goal area toward the end of the
game. ,
“Boyer made her way in on- goal
again, but fell and got trapped
beneath Brown. '

“She almost got past rne,’’‘
, Brown described the action, “but I

It seemed Brown would do_ any-
thing to keep the ball from going in
the net, and that fact was not for-
gotten by teammate Jacqueline Fix.

“She’s the backbone of our
team,” Fix said. “She’s awesome.-”

I played World Cup by watching me
out there today,” Brown said.
A Yesterday’s _ contest with
Richmond was -a close defensive

keep Pitt in the game.

She made 15 saves, allowing
just one goal in the 27th minute.

goal. '

It seems that B,rown’s attacking
style might have hurt her on that
particular play, but she also made
several big saves.

“There were a couple of times
where she misplayed the ball,” said
head coach Roland Sturk. “But I
have no doubt her leadership was
great out there.” ’ —

The former World Cup player,

‘who puts winning above all else,

has had mixed results to begin her
Pitt career

“We won, and I'm happy about
that,” Brown said after Friday’s
victory. “I’ll do anything I can to
help the team win.”

SOCCER

toward the goal but fired a shot wide of
the net. Ruiz then took a shot from the
corner, but a diving save by Kuhlman
kept the score at 1-1. .

With the Panthers playing a man
up because of the red card issued to
Palmer, Pitt was able to take advantage
of a breakaway situation just near the
end of the half.

Pitt defender Jacqueline Fix got
the ball on the right wing and made a
brilliant move to evade Air Force’s
Laura Abt, and from that point, she
fired a shot into the top right corner of
the goal to put Pitt up 2-1 with‘ 43:42
on the clock.

Fix, a native of nearby Monaca,
Pa., who Sturk calls the best player
from the Pittsburgh area playing colle-
giate soccer, doesn’t usually get the
chance to score goals, but she certainly
took advantage of her opportunity on
Friday. ' J . . M
“I like playing defense,” Fix said.
“But I certainly don’t mind the chance
to score goals.” — p . ’

Pitt went into the halftime break
with the 2-1 lead, but the game was far
from_ over. Boyer evened the contest
justover ﬁve rninutes into the second
half with a shot from the right side that
got past Brown.

"The Panthers tried to comeback

“In her position, a lot of people
don’t get scoring chances. But Jackie is
such a good player that I always want

Temple (2-9, 2-5 Big East)

The Owls will look to young talent
to help build a team that has been a
perennial doorrnat in the Big East.

Juniors Devin Scott and Mac
DeVito will lead the offense. Scott
threw for 1,815 yards and 12 touch-
downs while DeVito threw for 435
yards in limited action.

The only returning starter in the
backfield is fullback Jason McKie. Top
receiver junior Greg Muckerson had

in 1999. .

The Owls’ strength is on defense,
where they have a nucleus of talent led
