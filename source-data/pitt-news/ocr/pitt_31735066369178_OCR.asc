Steps to increase security in
the residence halls were
discussed with acting Vice
Chancellor William Markus
yesterday at an open meeting
of the Inter-Residence Board.

Working in conjuntion with
the Ofﬁce of Residence Life
Auxiliary Services and the
University Housing Ofﬁce the
Board drafted a series of
proposals, some of which
would result in increased costs
for all resident students begin-
ning next year.

Proposed were the following:

——prohibition of anyone ex-
cept holders of a Towers

parking permit and their
passengers in the garage and
basement after 8:00 p.m.

—possibly hiring a profess-
ional or student attendant to
keep watch over the garage.

--prohibition of middle ele-
vators in the Towers from
going to non-lounge ﬂoors
except during check-in and
check-out.

—pressuring the campus

police into moving their head-
quarters closer to the center of
the campus.
g —instituting a fine or
suspending student security
offenders from living in resi-
dence halls.

John Rosick, Resident

Student Association chairman,
described these proposals as
“short term,” meaning they
should be implemented im-
mediately.

Long-term proposals include
the installation of video
monitors in areas which
campus police consider to be
vulnerable to crime‘ and the
removal of the existing laundry
room in the Towers and
installation of washers and
dryers on_ each floor.”

The proposals will be studied
further and voted, upon at a
later meeting._

Markus urged those attend-
ing the meeting to thoroughly

'77 Langley Annex Explosion Brings Countless

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

On Jan. 20, two, years ago
tomorrow, an explosion ripped
through a section of Langley Hall
which housed two lecture halls,
laboratory facilities and ofﬁces.

The blast, determined in a
subsequent. investigation by Pitts- ‘
burgh City Police to have been
caused by gas-pipe leakage,"
injured’ 49 and killed two, Patricia
Hostetler, 20, a student from
Donegal, Pa. and Carleen Curry-,
35, a Pitt secretary from Pitts-
burgh ,,

The deaths, injuries, and des-

truction have touched off a
continuing series of legal suits
against Equitable Gas Company for
alleged negligence_ in properly
maintaining pipelines located un-
der the hall.
. Most notable of those cases are
those ﬁled by the families of Curry
and Hostetler, and_ by Hostetler’s_
ﬁance, Robert G. Cina, 21, from
Lower Burrell, and by the
University.

Dockets from the cases, ﬁled in
the Prothonotary’s Ofﬁce indicate
Equitable, while admitting some of
the blame for the incident, does not
wish to foot the entire" reparation
bill. ’

Pitt News Staff Writers _

Student Government Board
presidential candidates Drew
DiMaccio and Stan Galanski each
deﬁned what they consider to be
the major campaign issues in
Wednesday’s sparsely attended
presidential debate.

The debate, which some ﬁfty
people watched in the Kurtzman

District Attorney Robert E. Col-

Colville asked the candidates to
deﬁne what they thought were the
major issues of the campaign.
DiMaccio said these were the
isolation of student government,
the Pitt Union Programming
Council and allocations of student
money. ’

Galanski said he felt the issues
were academics, the campus bus
and the program council.

Concerning what he called
isolation on campus, DiMaccio said
he believes it is ‘ ‘important to work
on state-related problems,” but
“necessary to work on ‘campus-
related problems.” He said it was
important to get the SGB members
to attend the governance group
meetings. ‘

DiMaccio said he seriously
questions the constitutionality” of
the programjcouncil. He cited
section eight of the current SGB

constitution, which states that-all

groups much go through the
allocations hearings process. He
added that the program council was
not subjected to the allocations
process, but instead was granted a
ﬂat amount of money by the SGB.

Concerning allocations of stu-
dent money, DiMaccio reiterated
his support for the Governance
Group Fun-ding Amendment, a
proposed student government can-
stitutional amendment that would
turn 15 per cent of the student

activities fee over to the seven
governance groups.

The amendment will appear as a
referendum on a special ballot to be
voted on later this term.

Galanski, who listed academics
as a campaign issue, said he is
calling for an extension of the

deadlines, an improved hard bound

Presidential Candidates Talk Student Union Renovation

(Continued from page I)

DiMaccio also was in favor of an
improved academic review with
copies being distributed at’ depart-
mental ofﬁces. Instructors who
dc-n’t consent to having their
evaluations published in the review
will be listed as doing so.

Galanski" said he would like to
see a campus bus run an express to
Trees Hall, and have another one
run North Oakland to campus, and
South Oakland to campus routes.
Galanski said he would like the
administration to absorb the cost of
operating such a route.

Galanski listed the program
council as a major issue, and said
he would like to restore some of the
right to program to the students.
He said he believes small organiza-
tions depend on programming for
something to do.

constitution would remedy any
questions concerning the uncon-
stitutionality of the program
council.

Both candidates spoke also about
the proposed Student Union
rennovations. DiMaccio said he
was definitely not in favor of having
students pay for the rennovations.

He said he would like to see’

improved commuter lunch facilities
and a better choice of services
along with a more pleasant
atmosphere for commuter dining.
He also said he would like to see a
study area established to replace
the study space occupied by the
program council offices.

Galanski cited changes he would
like to see in the union. He said he
would like to see the food co-op

improved recreation room, a snack
bar, an “old English type bar,”
better TV facilities and, a trans-
portation center with an informa-
tion desk.

He said he would also like to _se_e
a ballroom, overnight facilities for
commuters, an auditorium, bowl-
ling alleys, campus phones, a quiet
study area, a special area for
student sales, a newsstand, lockers
for commuters, postal office
facilities, improved elevators and
as much student employment in the
union as possible.

Galanski said he didn’t feel
students should foot the entire bill
for renovations because faculty and
administrative offices in the Stu-
dent Union, prevent the building
from being entirely for student use.

university could pay for the work,
or the student could pay. He said
that if the students are’ to pay for

the rennovations, the latter issue

should only be decided by a student
referendum.

study “the proposals before
implementing them. He added
that reduced visitation may be
the answer to the entire
security problem.

“Our security system works
reasonably well, ” Markus said.
_ “This is the first murder in the
Towers proper. We can't really
put the rap on the campus
police.
“We have to augment the
. system to make it better.
Idon’t like to place dollar signs
before security, but this pro-

‘ gram has to pay for itself.
I don’t want to pass on
marginal costs to the con-
sumer.”

Tom Albert, director of
Auxiliary Services, said the
installation of washers and
dryers on each floor is not
feasible because of the expense
and the noise the washers and
dryers would create.

Albert did introduce a plan in
which a new laundry room
would be created in the old
snack bar next to the mail room
in the Towers B lobby.

Ombudsman’ Hears Request From Students Al Meeting-

By MARI HAWKES

The Student Affairs Advisory
Committee discussed suggestions
for improvement in handling
student business-related problems
at its meeting Wednesday.

Julius Ray, Student Ombudsman
for Business "Services, listened to
requests from students that asked
for improving staff-student rela-
tions, consolidation of the time
schedules and course descriptions‘
on the same ﬂoor and increasing
the availability of add/ drop forms.

“We must meetthe students
need without alienating them,”

Ray said concerning staff-Student
relations.

“We must be a little more aware
of what a student is about. More
attention must be paid to the
human elements of a student in a
hurry,” Ray said.

In regard to registration pro-
cedures, Student Government
Board president Josh Baylson
suggested thatone due date be
established for all invoices.

Currently, invoices are sentout 9
according to date of registration.

Those registering early——primarily
juniors and seniors—receive their
invoices sooner than und’erclass-

men and, therefore, must pay
tuition and fees at an earlier date
unless granted a deferral.

Additionally, students enrolled
in the College of Arts and Sciences
are billed first, and consequently
must pay before students enrolled
in other University schools.

Ray replied to Baylson that
offices dealing with billing and
processing of . invoices are so
scattered that it would be im-
possibleto handle all payments in
one day. He reminded"Bay1son
that the University has a student
population equivalent _to many
towns “or municipalities.

“The ball is in their (Equit-

Matthew Jackson, Assistant‘
University Council‘, said the univer-

negligence by any party, but is an .

Nosigniﬁcant action on-the Pitt

Jackson ‘ added that in his

opinion, the university should not

An out-of-court settlement for
any of the cases according to
several legal sources, is a
possibility.

While these cases, along with
approximately nine others ﬁled by
injured‘ persons, are building , the
university has plans for building of
another sort.‘

V According to Hunt Martin,

Director of Physical Plant, the
Pennsylvania Department of Gen-

eral Services (which replaced the ‘C

General by State Authority) has
granted the university $1.8 million

' to use for construction of anew

building on the old Langley site on
Tennyson Avenue.

Part of those funds, Martin said
came from insurance settlements
acquired by the department.

Ray stated that if a student has a

With Reluctance

dergraduates will elect him president of their student
government board during next week’s voting.

Each has been a determined and busy student of
late; the campaign has been peppered with issues
much as the campus has been spiced by election-
spawned signs. But while we are sure Galanski and
DiMaccio desire the office, we are not so certain we
care to see either assume the position he seeks.

To belittle either’s candidacy is not our goal. Any
student should be congratulated for investing time in
what could be a service to his fellow students. And
each has qualifications that could benefit him

during a presidency.

Drew DiMaccio is a Greek who was homecoming
concert chairman, who is well-informed because of
the campaign and who could be a welcome injection
of fresh spirit to student government’s offices. '

Stan Galanski is an independent SGB member, an
active member of several organizations and, in many
ways more than DiMaccio, a known quality.

Galanskils running mate is Todd Park, perhaps the

_ most attractive board candidate in the current cam-
 paign. DiMaccio’s affiliations are less public and less

demands. Student government at Pitt needs direc-
tion and force if it is to achieve a momentum that has
been lacking for years‘. Neither current candidate
appears able to handle that fuel bill.

But a student always is better for having voted,
and we believe he will have fared better—if only a bit
better—by casting a ballot for'Galanski. It is likely
the Student Union’s third floor—and student gover-
nment’s place on campus—will not change much un-
der Galanski’.s guidance, but he is, at least, a»knowri
commodity. 9

We thank DiMaccio and Galanski for allowing us
the opportunity to vote for them. We merely wish, in
addition, that someone else had afforded us another
opﬁon.

_ The Cultural Revolution began
on November 10, 1965, and Mao
turned to the nation's youth to lead
the surge. They were formed into a
vast organization called the Red
Guards with a membership of
approximatley 20 million. Mao’s
wife, Chiang Ching (Madame Mao)
was also a key organizer of the

purge and Chou En‘-lai functioned-

as a mediator between opposing
Maoist factions during this period:

The arts were abandoned and
Madame Mao, once an actress,
personally attacked the opera. The
policy of educating the masses
evolved, and standards for educa-
tion were lowered drastically.
“Class Struggle” became
theme of the Cultural Revolution.

Teachers were called “stinkng
bourgeois intellectuals” and were
punished and tortured publicly.
It was a period of chaos and
violence, which saw schools close
and students engaged in armed
battle. '

The successful candidate wil
His board promises to be inexperienced and his

promises will be difficult’ to fulfill if student govern-

ment’s arsenal remains unchanged.

It would require an exceptional individual tosup-
ply the drive and ability a successful presidency‘

“The Lost Decade of the Cultural
Revolution,” as it has come to be
know, most likely was a -bigger
purge than Mao had wanted. His
party and his country were divided
in the mid-1970's, but again,
thanks to Chou En-lai, stability was
returned and the opposition eli-
minated. A

g Mao had survived a war with the
Nationalists, a war in Korea with
the United States, and an ouster as
president of the Republic in 1959.
Again he sat as China’s undisputed
leader.

It was 6:30 p.m. July 15, 1971,
when President Nixon issued an
announcement heard simultan-
eously in Peking and the United
States. Nixon said that Premier
Chou En-lai and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger had held talks in
Peking and that the President had
accepted an invitation to visit
China. 

The announcement ended: “The
meeting between the leaders of
China and the United States is to
seek the normalization of relations
between the two countries and also
to exchange views on questions of

concern to the two sides.” Again,
the door was open.

The change in China’s attitude
can be attributed to Chou. The
brilliant statesman who spoke six
languages was
designing new policy which would
be ﬂexible to the outside world.
Mao reportedly was in failing in
health, and new party leaders were
receptive to proposals allowing
China to catch up with the rest of
the industrialized world. Chou’s
death on January 8, .1976 and
Mao's death later that year on
September 9, enabled the new
leaders to make abrupt changes in
China’s direction.

The visit of Chinese senior vice
premier Teng Hsiao Ping to
Washington, D.C. this January 29
should be the climax of temporary
goals in the new China policy. The
winning of official United States
recognition was the ﬁnal ac-
complishment over hindrances to
China becoming a modern world
power by 2000. Since the door was
closed for China gaining innovative
technological information and
equipment from Russia, the only

place left to turn was to the United
States.
Teng has said: “There is a new

atmosphere, gapouple involvement“

in science. and technology. ‘The
march to modernization is surging
throughout the country." Those
remarks, made to China’s National
Science Academy, show that the
party leaders look to science and
technology as the bases to
moderization.

However, the party leaders have
lifted the ban on -the arts and ‘have
turned to new educational policies.
Whereas “class struggle” was the
theme of the Cultural Revolution,
“quality education” has come to
represent this new era of modern-
ization. Emphasis is being placed

, on learning—from kindergarten to

college. Education is celebrated,
competitive, and rigorous. The
University of Peking has a goal to
double its enrollment to 20,000
within six years.

Competition among students is
rough, and the city student has a
much better chance for advance
schooling than his counterpart in
the rural countryside. Coaching for
college entrance examinations is
held four nights a week six months
before the tests. Only one out of 20
applicants will be accepted. China

will need many more scientists and"

engineers to reach its goals of
modernization, and 800,000 en-
gineers are hoped to be trained by
1985.

Many more students will be
allowedto study abroad, and just
last fall, -Pitt Chancellor Wesley
Posvar returned from a visit to
China and announced that Pitt will

take part in exchange programs
with Chinese universities.
~ English has become a part‘ of the
Chinese culture. The language is
taught to elementary school child-
ren. Mac has not
discredited,but he is being for-
gotten slowly. Madame Mao and
the other three members of “The
Gang of Four” were arrested in
1976. A new social system has
been developed, and the entire
country has been converted to the
modernization theme. \
The success of the new goals
may depend on how well the
peasants cope with modernization.
The peasants are at the’ bottom of
the Chinese social structure, and a
deﬁnite gap exists between the city

workers and those in the country- .

side. Should the gap widen andthe
goals fail by 2000, then Chinaagain
couldiﬁnd itself in internal tutmoil.

China’s new leaders have ‘deter-
mined’ to make China "ya techno-
logically sophisticated superpower
equal to the United States and
Russia. The United States could
not sit idly aside and pretend that
the world’s most populous and
bewildering nation did not“exist.
Rapprochement between the two

countries had to be more than an

ofﬁcial announcement made almost
eight years ago.

With the threat of war always
lingering between the Soviets and
China, the balance of world power
can be maintained better with
official ties intact. Recognition was
inevitable, and the long-range
effects should be positive.

Bergman Plays Perfect   ‘Autumn Sonata’  

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Autumn Sonata
Directed by Ingmar Bergman

Let's start out by getting one
thing straight: “Autumn Sonata”
is not an entertainment ﬁlm--not
entertainment in the usual Holly-
wood sense.

Through brilliant use of facial
close-ups and ﬂashbacks, Director
Ingmar Bergman has put together
a powerful, and intensely moving

psychological proﬁle of a mother-
daughter relationship. In this ﬁlm,
tortured souls battle with them-
selves and each other’s personal-
ities in a tangled web of
psycho-neuroses.

Liv Ullman portrays Eva, a
woman who was never allowed to
reach her own maturity because of
her domination by her mother_’s
wishes and desires. The mother,
Charlotte, is portrayed beautifully
by Ingrid Bergman.

The opening is relatively comp-
licated. Eva's husband, Victor

(Halver Bjork), informs the viewers
of Eva’s past. This bogs down the
viewer as he attempts to follow the
characters and unravel the complex
story line.

As the ﬁlm progresses, we learn
of the true feelings Eva has for her
mother--intense hatred and re-
pressed feelings that are slowly
revealed. When the ﬁlm reaches
its inevitable climax, many of the
more complex nuances in the plot
become clearer.

Ullman is positively brilliant in
this ﬁlm, moving from a woman

.E~T£R'-rAi~MtsNT

who has loving admiration for her
mother to a screaming, hysterical
woman who was never allowed to
blossom herself (“It’s as though
the umbilical cord has never been
cut,” Eva tells her mother at one
point). This movie does not thrill.
It impresses.

Bergman the actress also shines
in her role as a self-centered
mother from an extremely re-
pressed background. She is torn
with guilt for what she has done to
her two - daughters, Eva and
Helena, (the victim of a mentally

V

disabling disease), but she only
cares for her career as a concert
pianist. Bergman is able to hide
her neuroses behind a shell.
Ullman accidentally knocks off this
shell and Bergman scrambles to
pick it up to cover her guilt once
more.

This ﬁlm is very complex, both
emotionally and psychologically,
and should be treated as such. It is
a high-strung ﬁlm with important
social implications. _

“Autumn Sonata” is not a ﬁlm to
make you feel good inside.

Chuck Mangione’s ‘Sanchez ’ -4- Different

By HARRISON C. STACKPOLE
Pitt News Staff Writer
Chuck Mangione
The Children Of Sanchez
A&M Records

Before you can fairly judge
Chuck Mangione’s latest release,
“The Children Of Sanchez,” you
should know a little bit about some
of the things that were involved in
the recording of the album.

Hall Bartlett, the producer of the
film by the same name, contacted
Mangione in late August, 1979, to
write the score for the movie.
Mangione and his band had just
finished recording. “Feels So
Good” and were “exhausted,”

according to Mangione.

Mangione, however, had never
recorded a soundtrack for a
full-length motion picture (al-
though he had the soundtrack to
the television series “Side Street”
under his belt) and the idea was
very intriguing to him. \

Mangione accepted the offer,
only to ﬁnd out that he had about
three weeks to compose and record
the entire track. He immediately
locked himself in a motel room with
a piano over Labor Day weekend
and came up with a score.

From there it was into the
recording studio with his regular
recording crew of Chris Vadala on
woodwinds, Grant Geissman on
guitars, Charles Meeks on bass,
and James Bradley on drums,

along with a group of studio and
orchestra musicians.
Over the remainder of the three

week period, Mangione and his

crew recorded almost 24 hours of
music for approximately ﬁve hours
of ﬁlm.

This explains some of - the
strange things that occur in the
album; the’ rough edges; the
melody that permeates throughout
and the inclusion of “Bellavia,”

which is a cut from a Mangione ,

album of the same name.

Although the melody of ‘‘Child- ’

ren Of Sanchez” is a bit
repetitious, this in no way should
imply that that melody, which in its
most popular version is titled,
“Children Of Sanchez Overture,”
is not a very enjoyable and quality
theme.

The theme is found throughout
the album under different titles.

such as “Pilgrimage," “Hot
Consuelo,”, “Death Scene,” and
“Fanfare,” as well as the

aforementioned “Overture.” The
work is an effort to manipulate a
certain. melody under different
circumstances and it is important
that the listener understand this as
he listens to this album.

As always, the quality of artists
on this Mangione album is superb.
Aside from Mangione and his band
outstanding performances are
turned in by Ron Leonard, who
plays a magniﬁcent cello through-

out the album, and Don Potter,
whose vocals are 'very wll done
when one considers the fact that,
above all, this is a jazz album.

“The Children of Sanchez” is
not an album that everybody‘ is
going to appreciate, and it
shouldn’t be forced down anyone’s
throat. But it is a high quality
album that explores a new
dimension in jazz music for
Mangione,’and Mangione fans will
be sure to recognize the talents of
their heroin this release. If you are
into jazz, Mangione jazz in
particular, you might just get a real
kick out of this album.

The style of “Children of
Sanchez is somewhat similar to
“Feels so Good.”- However,’ a
marked development of his musical
style is clear here. .

In “Feels so Good,” Mangione’s
horn was very airy and translucent.
It ‘seemed to sail above the
instrumental. backing. The same is
true of “Children of Sanchez” to
the extent that he has continued his
musical, style while avoiding the

more commercial touches of the.

previous album. L

“Children of Sanchez,” how-
ever, has provided Mangione with
his second great commercial
success. —

The album took Mangione three
weeks to write (“Feels so Good”
was composed in a week) and was
to musically illustrate the ﬁlm

“based on Oscar Lewis’ book,
“Children of Sanchez.” The book,
a look at the adventures of a
mythical Mexican family, has long
been a cult favorite.

During a press conference prior
to his appearance at Pitt’s
homecoming concert in October,
Mangione discussed the then
upcoming album. “ ‘Children of

 

Sanchez’ would never have been
possible if not for the success of
‘Feels so Good,’ ” Mangione said,
“I would never have dared to do
the project.”

Although Mangione said nothing
in the album is geared for hit single

status, “Children of Sanchez” has ,

been well received.

by his excellent vocal work. It’s
Matthews’ voice--smooth, silky and
mildly dynamic--that’s emphasized
in his recordings.

notable successes (“M"‘A"'S*H”
and “Paper Chase”).

The big problems’ with contin-
uing a movie storyline on television
are: (1) getting the actors and
actresses to extend their movie

roles to continue the legitimacy of

the ﬁlm and (2) dreaming up a new
premise every week without selling
out the plot.

The pilot of “Delta House”
already has failed in the ﬁrst count.
Otter (Tim Matheson), Bluto (John
Belushi), Pinto(Thomas Hulse),
Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf) and
Gregg Marmalard (James Daugh-
ton) all have left the series.

Matheson, for example, claimed
in a Playboy interview that he could
- not continue his role because of the

general ideas of college life—-
disrespect for authority, lots of
anti-social behavior and a general
good time~are easy to portray here
week-by-week. Also, this show_is
written and produced by the same
folks who brought us the~ﬁlm,
Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney
and Chris Miller.

The show’s debut, which ran last

night, is just the pilot; the series V

begins on Saturday, January 28.

Yes, “Delta House” is another
exception to the general rule.
Despite the new faces, the pilot
moves along extremely well. The
same pranks are pulled and Dean
Vernon Wormer (John Vernon),
Neidermeyer (Gary Cookson), and
Marmalard (Brian Patrick Clarke)

Larry (Pinto) Kroger; and Josh
Mostel as Blotto, Bluto’s younger
brother. Mostel is very good at his
job here, acting ﬁrst as a student
attempting to control his “animal
instincts, and later as a near
‘carbon-copy of Bluto (he eats
bottles!).

in fact, the whole spirit of the
ﬁlm has been recaptured by these
amazing actors.

Those who loved “Animal
House” will adore “Delta House.”
Cynical fans of the ﬁlm might tune
in with reservations. “How could it
be possible to vulgarize the ﬁlm
with television, and have it still
come through as the exceptional
ﬁlm it was?” they will ask.

single offerings by Robert Palmer.
Rogers and Hammerstein, Richard
Stekol, Jeff Comanor, and John
Martyn.

The opening track on side one,
“Gimme an Inch”, is one of the
album’s faster-paced tunes. It
seems to have origins in the
contemporary jazz-rock fusion.

The brisk “Don’t Hang Up Your
Dancing Shoes” follows. Con-
cerned with the frustration of
unrequitted love, it is one of the
strongest cuts on the album.

The very effective string ensem-
ble in “King of the Nighf’
compliments Matthews’ soft, po-
etic vocals. On this particular
material Matthews excels.

‘ Finishing up side one are, “Man
in the Station”, a psuedo-funk
pirxe with excellent blues harp
accompaniment, and “Let There
Be Blues,” another easy listening
piece. The vocals on this final cut
are again very good, off-set by just
a wisp of alto sax played by Mel
Collins.

The first track on side two is
“Carefully Taught.” This is an

\ acappella piece done in a three part

vocal harmony that would rival thga

best efforts of Crosby, Stills an I
Nash.

The title cut, “Stealin Home,”
follows. It is another of the
album’s standouts, featuring good
lead guitars and fine keyboard
work. .

Next is “Shake It.” It was
released as a single and is patiently
climbing the A M ladder to number
one.' It’s a mildly frenzied piece
that constitutes one of Matthews’
few singles.

The most interesting cut lyrically
is “Yank and Mary (Smile).” Two
Midwest ruralists head, west toy
California in search of Utopia, only‘
to find it to be terribly elusive.

The concluding pieces, “Slip
Away” and “Sai1 My Soul”

comprise the duo co-written with ~»

Bill Lamb. Both are fine‘
compositions. ‘

“Stealin Home” has a lot of '
style. It’s a very musical album
that should satisfy all Matthews’
fans as well as attract new
listeners.

  Panthers Prepare for Tenors of Lehigh Wrestlingicrowd

By JIM LEWIS
‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team’s
preparation for fourth-ranked Le-
high Saturday includes‘ extra

conditioning—and screaming.
“We’re doing a lot of yelling at
them," Panther headvcoach Dave
Adams said. “We’re going to have
a lot of noise in the practice room to
prepare for Lehigh’s home crowd.”
The Engineers’ home gym.
which seats approximately 2,500
people, is always filled with a loud.
sellout crowd which assistant head
coach Rande Stottlemyer calls

“unmerciful . ’ ’

“And I’m not kidding when I say
‘unmerciful,’ ” Stottlemyer said.
“They’re crude, rude—any bad
word you can think of. They attack
you personally.”

Last year, Pitt hosted Lehigh and
lost a close 21-12 match. The year
before,‘ the Panthers traveled to
Bethlehem, Pa., and were crushed
by the Engineers and their
boisterous crowd, 42-3.

“Their crowd is worth about 7-8
points,” Stottlemyer said..

This year, - Pitt walks into
Lehigh’s den with a three-match
winning streak, using the same

(150), Tom Jones (158), Skip Bolin

(HWT).

Lehigh, coming pff a,home-gym

Louisiana State, will counter with
three all-Americans: Steve Bas-
tianelli (118 pounds), Mark Kieber-
man (177) and Mike Brown (190).

“In all honesty, I don’t think

Adams said. “And those all-
Americans give them a little extra
power.”

The Engineers’ only losses came
against top-ranked Iowa, third-
ranked Wisconsin and twentieth-
ranked Eastern Wrestling League
member Cleveland State (which
Pitt will meet in Pittsburgh Feb.
10)-—all on the road.

“We're working a little harder

Olinger,

Confidence
Return

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor
Wednesday night’s game
against Cleveland State was not
particularly remarkable during the
first 20 minutes. Both teams made
36 percent of their shots from the

‘field, which accounted for a 33-23

halftime score. .

The Panther basketball team
outrebounded easily Cleveland
State’s taller Vikings, and the
switch to playing a consistent
pressing game set up numerous
Pitt steals and subsequent fast
breaks, which is exciting to watch.

But a big surprise came in the

second half as (shades of Tom
' Richards) guards Dave Olinger and

Pete Strickland accounted for 18
combined points, practically all of
which were scored from consider-
able distances.

It has been one of those kind of
high-low seasons for Olinger, a 6
foot, 5 inch sophomore from
Fresno, Ohio. He earned a starting
spot in the Panther lineup at the
beginning of the season and scored
a season-high of 15 points against
Indiana University of Pennsylvan-
1a.

Then came the Canisius game, a

‘frustrating contest in which Olinger

shot poorly. The next six games
were a series in which he saw
minimal playing time and rarely
even attempted to shoot.

“Ever since that 2 for 11 game at
Canisius, I’d been losing confi-
dence in myshot,” Olinger said.
“The problem was mainly me,
because I’d get down on myself and

that just made things worse.”

Pitt Hockey Club Alive and, Well . . .

Pitt’s hockey club is alive and well. Well, maybe

years (2-5), seem to be spending much of their time
between blue lines these days and must hope to
rediscover either end of the rink before their two-
game trip to Cincinnati tonight and tomorrow.

The club's lessons, sandwiched__.between wins
against Penn State-McKeesport, 5-2, and Duquesne,
4-3, are better described as pillages: 7-4 to Ohio
University; 8-1 and 9-2 to Bowling Green’s junior
varsity; and’9-3 and 15-3 to Eastern Michigan.

Coach Dan Tucci’s Panthers do have a defense,
however. Of the three teams to which Pitt has lost,
only Ohio can be said to be on a level of talent and
resources equal to that of the Panthers, victims of
overscheduling and underdevelopment.

On the other end of the spectrum, though, are

Eastern Michigan and Bowling Green. teams whose
games nearly outnumber the practice sessions afford-
ed Pitt. The Hurons, though only in their second
year of competition, are members of the Mid-Central
Collegiate Hockey Association and are on the verge
of going varsity, a remote possibility for Pitt’s club.
The JV Falcons aren’t hurting either, being slightly
inferior to their varsity counterparts, who finished
third in last year's NCAA Division 1 Ice Hockey
Championships.

“The losses are my fault. I overscheduled the,

- Pitt Clips
.CSU, 77-5l

By cms HOEL
Pitt News Sports Editor
Pitt’s Panthers, struggling to stay ahead of a schedule
designed to spawn prosperity, moved past .500 Wednesday
by clipping’Cleveland State, 77-51, at the Field House.

Sam Clancy’s 16 points and 17 rebounds paced the
Panthers, who spurted past the Vikings with a second-half
surge that expanded a four-point lead (33-29) into a
26-point victory. -

The Panthers (7-6) travel to Morgantown tomorrow to
engage West Virginia’s Mountaineers, who defeated Penn
State, 72-53, Wednesday at State College.

Wednesday’s win came against an
opponent that largely was a
one-man (guard Franklin Edwards)
team. But CSU (6-8 against a poor
schedule) turned poor Pitt play into a
close basketball game shortly after
the second half began.

But Pitt’s rebounding, coupled
with the play of a pair of guards
who’d been spurned by Panther
coach Tim Grgurich earlier this 

season, allowed ‘the Panthers to
cruise toward victory. Dave o"n9°r

Grgurich sent Pete Strickland into the game during the
timeout born of the 33-29 score and the Panthers
responded with a ﬂurry of points that made victory secure
and the ﬁnal 10 minutes a meaningless period. -

Strickland scored 10 points, with five field goals, and
sophomore Dave Olinger, whose recent performance had
led Grgurich not to play Olinger at George Washington,
contributed a 12-point second half. Olinger, one of several
Pitt guards whose reluctance to shoot has displeased Pitt’s
coach, made five of seven attempts from the field.

Grgurich “just told me to go out there and take my
shot,” Olinger said.

Cleveland State, whose ‘taller players resembled
ﬂamingos more than they did basketball players, was no
match for Pitt either during or after a shot. Pitt’s shooting

percentage (43) was not exceptional, but it was better than\

CSU’s (38).

Pitt hit nine of 11 free throws; Cleveland State made half
of its 24 attempts.

The Vikings were outrebounded by Pitt. They nearly
were outrebounded by Clancy (17) and Sam Ellis (10). The
team margin was 57-31. ..

Cleveland State has a small team; three of its better (well
not-as-bad) players are Edwards (6-1), Greg Cobb (5-11)
and Ron Harris (5-10). When CSU coach Ray Dieringer
scanned his bench, he once saw 5-8 senior Stanley Quirk,
who played but did not score.

The only Panthers whose shooting was poor were Terry
Knight and Sam Ellis, who have been among the few
consistent Pitt players during a season of streaks, one of
which,the Panthers hope, has begun with a win against
Cleveland State.

PITT NOTES: “I think Pitt felt it could blow us out any
minute,” Cleveland State’s coach Dieringer said. “They
destroyed us off the glass”...Knight, who scored 12 points
(six of 18 from the ﬂoor), lost his team scoring lead to
Clancy...the Panthers will take on Iona, one of the East’s
better teams, Monday at Nassau Coliseum...Pitt’s halftime
lead was 10 (33-23)...Steve Gordon contributed four points
and ﬁve rebounds during his brief stay in the Pitt ,

Much of the same may be realized against the

many more hockey games; And the Panthers can
start shaping those figures tonight at Riverfront.

Olinger,  
Confidence
Retum p

“Dave just had to get his
confidence back,” said coach Tim
Grgurich following the Cleveland
State matchup. In that game
Olinger entered the game with
slightly more than 14 minues, left,
then proceeded to are in four long
shots, and threw in a layup and a
couple of free throws for good
measure.

“We’ll be needing Dave and his
shooting in our lineup,” added
Grgurich.

“For the last couple of practices,
I haven’t been allowedto pass the

ball,” Olinger said. “The coaches
, would make me shoot every time

and this really helped.” -

Strickland, the Panthers’ de-
signated super-sub, was a key
figure in the success of his team’s
pressing defense Wednesday
night.

. , . “I think our pressing made a lot

of difference because the game just
lot quicker.
Sure, we had a lot of turnovers but

when you’re runnning, it’s only .

natural,” commented the senior
point guard.

“I wasn't real pleased at first
(about Pitt’s slow first half).
We weren’t ready to play right
away and were actually lethargic.
Any other night we could have
been in a lot of trouble. But we are
determined, to be better prepared
for Saturday night.”

The difference between playing
West Virginia University in
Morgantown Saturday and Cleve-
land State at the Field House will
be shockingly evident from the
moment Pitt steps out on the court
to warm up.

“We expected the crowd to be
rowdy last year, but nobody
showed up,” recalled Olinger.
“It’ll be different this time, but I’m
looking forward to the game.”
