Campus police officer honored

By Andrea Barczykowskiv
Staff Writer

A University of Pittsburgh
department of public safety
officer has been honored by the
American Training System of Self
Defense as Martial Artist of the
Year.

The award, presented to Curtis
Smith, “is the best; it’s very
important to ATS,” said John C.
Kanzler, instructor and assistant

‘ regional director of the American

Karate Black Belt Association.
According to Kanzler, “The
Martial Artist of the Year is an
individual outside of the
American Training System of Self
Defense, who by their skill and

expertise in and out of
competition improves the arts,
improves the character of those
they inﬂuence as students and
friends and sets an example for
every martial artist to follow.”

Smith graduated from Pitt on a
football scholarship, then
attended the Allegheny County
Police Academy. In 1986 he won
the Pa. Belt Championship and
the Superstar Championship in
self—defense. He is mentioned in
Who's Who in Karate and was
recently inducted into the National
Federation of Martial Arts Karate
Hall of Fame. He was also rated
No. 1 in self—defense by NASQA,
a national ratings system.

“I’ve had a lot of headaches

and sorrows and also some good
points, but the most important
thing is to build character,” said
Smith.

He also stressed the importance
of family in his pursuits.

Smith said, “If you take the
values of the martial arts, family
is very important. Without family
unity, we would fall apart."

Besides just using the arts for
competitions, Smith uses his skill

to teach others how to defend

themselves.

“Martial arts is a growing field‘
and a positive field. It’s getting
even bigger because humans have
a need to feel‘ safer and stronger.
[They will do] anything to feel
comfortable and secure.”

Outstanding proﬁs to be awarded

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

The Provost’s Office is now
taking nominations for the 1990
President's Distinguished
Teaching Award, which is offered
every year to outstanding faculty.

Dr. Margaret Waterman,
director of the office of faculty
development, said that any group
can nominate a teacher for the
award. “Any person who has
evidence of fine teaching is
permitted to offer a nomination,”
she said. ,

Waterman added that groups
wishing to submit applications
for a faculty member must also
give strong evidences of the

5-,, professor’s work in three separate

classes. Types of evidences would
be instructional materials,
activities taken to improve
teaching techniques, a supporting
letter from the dean of the college
or department chair, and proof of
formal teaching evaluation by
students from three recent
courses.

A panel of judges will go
through the credentials of the
nominee. They will assemble a
dossier, containing both student
and peer evaluations of each
candidate, along with other
evidences of their teaching
excellence. Waterman added that
student evaluations are “very
important” to the judges.

Any teacher who wins the
award will receive a cash bonus

of $2,000 and an instructional
development grant of $3,000.
Teachers who win will be not be
eligible to win the award again
for six years. Any faculty member
who has worked full time at the
university for three years can be

nominated as long as he or she is A

active in teaching.

Sally Murphy, an assistant
professor of communications, was
one of four recipients of the award
last year. Murphy said that this
was the “most significant award I
could have won."

“At first, I was skeptical about
winning the award, because there
are so many fine teachers at this
institution,” she said. “But I was
very pleased by the support I got

First ROTC frat
organized at Pitt

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

Army and Air Force cadets at
the University of Pittsburgh have
formed the country’s first ROTC
fraternity.

Rho Tau Chi is “a place where
ROTC cadets can meet on a
social, friend-to-friend basis,
instead of strictly cadet—to-cadet,”
according to Cadet 2nd Lt. Rich
Howett, president of the
fraternity.

“I have to give a lot of credit to
Jo Parks," Howett said of the
fraternity’s vice president. “She
did a lot of the constitutional
work.”

9 Howett said their constitution
has been approved by the SGB
and, they have already held social
functions such as a “mocktail
and movie” mixer and an ice-
cream social.

“We are not affiliated with the
IFC,” Howett said. “We are a

professional fraternity, not a social
one.

“Professionalism is the most
important aspect,” Howett
continued. “We have to know
what [issues] we’ll be facing.
Right now the military is cutting
back on officers; we need to
know how this will affect us.”

Rho Tau Chi is open to all
Army, Air Force and Navy cadets
who have at least a second-
semester freshman status. It is
also open to alumni and certain
instructors.

This year’s senior class initiates
will become the first alumni of
the organization.

The purposes of the fraternity
are to promote interaction among
the cadets of different branches
of the military and to provide a
social outlet for the cadets.

Rho Tau Chi plans to have a
mandatory study night at the
library, bring in speakers and
have service projects.

For The Pitt News

A $78,000 grant from the
American Foundation for AIDS
Research is enabling doctors
at the University of Pittsburgh
to study the development of
AIDS in infants infected with
the virus through their mothers.

The grant was awarded to
the University of Pittsburgh
Graduate School of Public
Health last September. The
research, which began on Oct.
1, is headed by Phalguni Gupta,
Ph.D., associate professor of
infectious diseases and
microbiology.

Gupta, in collaboration with
Andrew H. Urbach, M.D.,
associate professor of
pediatrics at Pitt, and Michael
Brady, M.D. of Ohio State
University, will share blood
samples and information on
pediatric cases.

“The question we’re trying
to sort out is——are there
different strains of the human
immunodeficiency virus 1,
which is the AIDS virus,”
Urbach says, “ and if so, do the
infants that get it from their
mothers get infected by a more
virulent strain?"

The doctors are also seeking
to answer questions such as

Effects of AIDS Virus
on newborns studied

why infants are infected‘ by
their virus—carrying mothers in
only 25 to 50 percent of the
cases.

The study, which Urbach
says will last for a minimum of
two years, will also focus on
the development of AIDS in
the children over time.

Urbach said, “Some children
go on to have mild symptoms,
and develop AIDS. We want to
know what it is that makes the
virus act differently in each
child.”

According to Gupta, it is
difficult to do AIDS research
on babies because the
incubation period for children
is so short compared to that of
an adult, which is 10.7 years. It
may be because the immune
system of babies is not fully
developed, or that newborns
receive different strains of the
virus through the placenta.

So far only four patients have
been recruited into the
program, but the number is
expected to grow.

“We're collaborating with
Columbus, Ohio, so we
anticipate getting 30 to 40
babies in over a year or two.

“A lot has happened in AIDS
research,” Urbach said, “but
there is a lot more work to be
donef

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, January 17, 1990

By Christina Turner
For the Pitt News

Two years ago, a group for
student alcoholics and drug
addicts was formed to provide
support for those recovering from
substance abuse. Since then, a
group under the guidance of the
Student Health Service Education
Office has been available for any

student wishing to participate.

The group is a self-help group,
much like Alcoholics Anonymous
and Narcotics Anonymous. It is
directed toward students who
are recovering from substance
abuse and those who realize they
have a problem and need help.
The sessions are held every
Saturday night from 7:30 to 8:30
in Forbes Quadrangle.

In addition to providing social
support, the recovery group alerts
students to other such self-help

groups in the Pittsburgh area."
The group also presents a social
setting where alcohol and drugs
are not the focus.

f‘Bars are very much the center
of college social life,” said Shirley
Haberman of the Student Health
Service Education Office. “The
party scene is very hard for
recovering students.” Haberman
also said students should be aware
of the alternative activities on
campus such as the ones set up
by the Pitt Program Council, the
Student Health Advisory Board
and others. “Our culture is
permissive toward alcohol,”
pointed out Haberman, “and
drinkers need to be more tolerant
of non-drinkers.’’ »

Peer pressure is the reason

sophomore, started drinking in
high school. John is now a

alcoholic. He has been a part of
the recovery group for 18 months.

“The recovery group is the only
thing that has kept me sober and
clean,” said John. “You have to
have the will to overcome
addiction for yourself  No one
can force you to do it.”

When John’s parents found out
about his problem, they gave
him an ultimatum: go into
rehabilitation or no college
education. John went into
rehabilitation and came to Pitt 11
days later.

“From that point on, I could
have done pretty much what I
wanted, but I joined the group,”
said John. The recovery group

has put John in touch with other
self—help groups, and he said that
85 to 90 percent of his friends are
also recovering.

John realizes he can never go
back to drugs and alcohol. He
said stories he heard in various
groups made him realize a relapse
could take him a step further.in
his addiction.

“There are three options for me
if I go back,” John stated, “death,
jail or an institution.”John was an
addict for a year and a half until
his high school informed his
parents of his problem.

Campus self-belp group aids recovering substance abusers

students early. According to a
survey she conducted last winter,
4 percent of the students surveyed
were recovering from drug or
alcohol addiction. “An attitude
shift is needed,” said Haberman.
“We need more student-to-
student support.” E

No specific leader is appointed
for the group. The opportunity to
lead the session changes each
time the students meet. Typically,
though, the student who has been

recovering the longest leads the .

group. New participants are
greatly encouraged to share in
the discussion as well as learn
from their peers.

T/be Decade of the 1980's

5,‘ The 1980s were a remarkable decade.

The big names changed from Nixon, Brezhnev, Ford,
Carter, Begin, Sadat, the Shah, Somoza and T orrijos to
Reagan, Gorbachev, Bush, Thatcher, Khadafy, Ceaus-
escu, the Ayatollah, Ortega and Noriega. '

, The catalyst for Eastern European freedom became
known as “Solidarnosc,” supply-side economics was

_ termed “Reaganomics,” neo-Soviet-style political open-

ness and economic restructuring became known as
“glasnost” and “perestroika,” and the diversion-of-funds-
from-Iranian-arrns-sales—to-the-Nicaraguan-rebels was
dubbed “Iran-Contra.” - ,

Ollie North, Manuel Noriega, Moammar Khadafy, Dan

Quayle and Lech Walesa became household names. _

The first lady was cheered for her “Just say no” cam-
paign, but was jeered for her fascination with astrology.
We saw a $300—billion plus military budget bring the

Soviets to the bargaining table, but also witnessed its
effect on the federal budget deficit.

 A seven-year continuing economic expansion made un-
employment and inﬂation things of the past, but home-
‘lessness remained a problem for the future. —

Superpower relations transcended the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, to the “Evil Empire,” to Ronald Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev with their arms around, one another in
Red Square. . I

Our television sets broadcasted shootouts in the Persian
Gulf between the United States and Iran, the U.S. bomb-
ing of Libya, a truck—bomb explosion at a U.S. compound
in Beirut which killed 241 Marines, Great Britain and
Argentina battling in the Falklands, an eight-year ‘war
between Iraq and Iran which left over one million dead,
and the U.S. invasions of Grenada and Panama —— both

‘ resulting in international condemnations but hemispheric
liberations. ,

We saw a female vice-presidential nominee and Su-
preme Court appointee, and a black civil-rights leader

w~..,r finish second in the Democratic presidential nomination.

We found that the Federal Reserve Board could not only
control interest rates but also prohibit stock market
crashes.  "G

We went from the Challenger to Discovery to the
Voyager. And from superconductors to “cold fusion” to
split-liver and multi-visceral transplants.

Among the decade’s new health and environmental
issues were crack, AIDS, cholesterol, steroids, the ozone
layer, the destruction of the tropical rain forests and global
warming, the Mount St. Helens eruption, and major

 earthquakes in Algeria, California, Mexico City and

Armenia. . L »

Fifty-two U.S. hostages were released from Iran after a
444-day ordeal. ,

There was no energy crisis or Three Mile Island, but
there was Chernobyl and Exxon.

. Greenpeace moved from the whales to the sails.

Striking air-traffic controllers were fired.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown
and died. 1

 Both communism and the Berlin Wall fell. Chinese
students protested.

The 1980s were a tumultuous decade, indeed.

Soldiers take a soldier's chance.
They must realize that there is a
chance that they will be killed in
action; otherwise, they shouldn’t
be in the military. In the 19805,
335 US. servicemen were killed
in action. But were theirdeaths
worth it? Did they die for the
betterment of freedom, or could
their deaths have been averted?
Let’s take a look at our five mili-
tary interventions in the decade
and see how we fared. 0

Lebanon, 1983. The deploy-
ment of troops in Lebanon was a
disaster waiting to happen. The
United Nations sent a “peacekeep-
ing” force to calmthe Beirutarea
after the Syrian/Israeli invasion.
Unfortunately there was no peace
to be had in the region. The
Arabs did not fear our power.
They proved that by shooting
and killing six of our servicemen.
Another one was killed by a
mine. But we didn't seem to get
the point. So an Arab terrorist,
fearing nothing, drove a truck
loaded with explosives right into
the U.S. Marines’ barracks; 248
Marines died. It was the worst
single loss of U.S. servicemen in
one day sincejan. 13, 1968, when
250 men were killed at the begin-
ning of the Tet offensive in Viet-
nam. Even after the U.S. embassy
in Beirut had been bombed one
year earlier, causing 63 deaths,
we didn't learn our lesson. It took
this abomination to make us learn
that we would have no positive
effect in the region. The decade
was off to a rocky start, to say the
least.

Grenada, 1983. Less than one
week after the tragedy in Leba-
non, the United States invaded
the tiny island of Grenada. Presi-
dent Reagan felt that the 1,000
Americans, including 700 students
at the St. George University of
Medicine, could not be safely
evacuated after a bloody coup
d’etat. So with the help of six
other Caribbean countries, we
landed troops on the beaches to
protect American lives. Eighteen

85 more were wounded. Later
we found six warehouses full of
Soviet and Cuban weaponry. Our
troops were not only fighting
Grenadan soldiers, but Cuban
regulars as well. It was an ex-
ample of defending American
lives, and would later be used as
a precedent.

One bad thing about the mis-

sion was the reconnaissance. Two
days after the invasion, another
group of Americans was found
on the other side of the island.

 

Bad recon would come back to
haunt us later.

Libya, 1986. And now- we
come to everybody’s favorite
raving lunatic: Col. Moammar
(Muammar, Mohammar) Gadhafi
(Quaddafi, Khadafy). He won’t
even tell the world how to’ spell

_ his name. Why should we even

need a reason to step on him?
Well, we found one anyway.
Citing “irrefutable evidence” link-
ing him to the bombing of a
Berlin discotheque which killed
an American serviceman, Presi-
dent Reagan sent 24 F-111 bomb-
ers from Great Britain to wreak
havoc on the country. Two of
our men were killed in the raid.
But this raid produced its desired
effect —— over the long run, ter-
rorism as a whole has gone down.

Later, our “irrefutable evidence”
appeared somewhat dubious.
Oh, well. _

Persian Gulf, 1987. The Iran-
Iraq War raged on for eight years.
When that war started attacking
neutral shipping, Reagan again
stepped in" to protect the inno-

cent. This was especially danger- V

ous, because the Iranians were

Military Successes...

even prone to attack ships carry-
ing their own oil. So we dis-
patched a naval task force into
the Persian Gulf to escort 10
reﬂagged tankers in and out of
the Gulf with Kuwaiti oil. On
only the second mission, how-
ever, the S.S. Bridgeton hit a
mine, sustaining heavy damage.
Later, the U.S.S. Stark was hit by
an Iraqi missile, killing 37. The
U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts also hit
a mine and was heavily dam-
aged, luckily, there were no
‘casualties there. For these min-
ings, we turned an Iranian oil
platform into dust. This region
was, again, an accident waiting
to happen, as shown by the Stark

. incident and the Iranian airbus

tragedy. We did achieve our
purpose.

Panama, 1989. When he was
elected, many critics called
George Bush a wimp. Well, never
fear; he has taken care of that by
deploying 24,000 troops to Pan-
ama to arrest 01’ Pineapple Face
(or Manuel Noriega). This was

possibly one of the worst-kept

secrets of all time. The Panama-
nians knew about it. People in
Congress knew about it (which
basically kills any secret). Nori-
ega. knew about it 48 hours in
advance. This invasion should
have been doomed from the start.
Bad recon reared  ugly head
again, as five American troops
got stuck waist-deep in the mud.
Had it not been for the Panama-
nian civilians coming to the res-
cue, there would have been 28
casualties instead of 23. But after
all that, we still got Noriega.
Strange. _

So how did we fare? Well, we
achieved our objective in four
out of the five. Unexpected
“accidents” occurred in two of
the live. And one was a complete
disaster. But overall, our military
performed very well, despite
criticism of our actions from
abroad.

UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Decade-mania is upon us.
Everywhere I look in the media,
I see stories listing the most sig-
niﬁcant events of the 19805. Many
stories ask what the ’80s should
be named. I don't know why
everyone is still looking behind
us, though the fact that the ’90s
are less than three weeks old
mayhave something to do with
this. 7 _

Anyway, along with the lists of
top “news events, albums, fads,
movies, etc.,_ I am going’ to in-
clude my own list: the Top 10
dictators of the 1980s.

This may sound extreme,‘ but-I
am actually talking about a fine
tradition of totalitarianism, re-
pression by any means (some-
times including murder) and

. human rights violations. Stalin,
Mussolini, Mao. Zedong, Pol Pot, ,

the late Chicago Mayor Richard
Daley — all men Machiavelli
would have been proud of.

Of course, the last decade had
its share of dictators: men of all
sizes, shapes, races and radical
ideologies. Here is my list of the
most significant and accom-
plished dictators of the 19805.
Let's start with honorable men-
tions for Polish generaljaruzelski,
the man who tried to squash
Solidarity, and for Leonid
Brezhnev, for keeping Stalinism

It seemed like every time we
turned on our televisions or radios
in the 19805 someone was offer-
ing us a magical solution for
whatever ailed us.

If the problem was a few extra
pounds, no need to sweat —
literally. Just take a few revolu-
tionary new diet pills that work
overnight! After all, who wants
to exercise or eat salad when just
$59.95 for a three-week supply
can erase those candy— bar and
french-fry calories — before they
are digested, of course. And there
were even a variety of plans to

fruit Diet, the Beverly Hills Diet
and the T-factor Diet.

so we called him a good guy in
the beginning of the decade. With

presidency in a fair election —-

Ferdie proved us wrong. Any- '

bloodiest dictator, but he didn't
take any ﬂak from the people ‘he
ruled over. Imagine, Haitians
getting upset about trite things
like mass unemployment and the
poorest sanitation conditions on
the planet. '

8. Pablo Escobar. Some may
not consider the most powerful
Colombian drug lord a dictator.
However, Escobar has managed
to become one of the richest men
in the world; in fact, he offered to
pay Colombia’s national debt if
drug running were made legal.
When the authorities didn't take
him up on the offer, Escobar’s

WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 17, 1990

A decade without dictators just isn't a decade...

The bombings, hijackings and
‘other terrorist acts kept little
Moammar busy for much of the
decade. Anyone who thinks that
there is a chance of dealing with
Khadafy rationally should ask
him about his opinion on inter-
national ocean boundaries.

4. -Ayatollah Ruhollah
I thought about
ranking him at. No. 1, but he

reached his peak with the take- 

over of the American embassy in
1979. Still, he kept the hostages
-throughout the first year of the

decade and managed to pull off

room for opinions different from
 — in Iran or abroad — by
putting a hefty price on Salman

goat is ﬁnally worm food. Sev-
eral people died in the rush to
touch his corpse,‘ which shows
that the Ayatollah’s career may
have been inﬂuenced by The
Who.

3. Manuel Noriega. A very
talented man, this dictator was
paid the ultimate dictatorial

forces _invaded Panama because

several serious illnesses, most
notably AIDS and heart disease,
have forced Americans to take a
serious look at their health habits.

Just 10 years ago, nobody had
even heard of AIDS, let alone
knew what it was. Then out of the
blue, Acquired Immune Deﬁ-
ciency Syndrome became a
household term. Everybody was
afraid of it and feared that just
touching an infected person was
enough to kill them. Those and
other rumors ran rampant. Per-
haps proof that AIDS has become

but awareness about their poten-
tial dangers became more hip
than ever. From catch phrases
such as “Just say no” and “Thisfis
your brain on drugs...” to the
Drug Czar’s War on Drugs, to the
capture of a drug-peddling Pana-
manian dictator, America dis-
played its commitment to ridding
the country of drug abuse.

Alcohol abuse among teenagers
became another concern of the
19805. We saw groups such as

2. Nicolae Ceausescu. 1989
was a bad year for dictators, with
the deaths of both Khomeini and
this Romanian leader. Despite
pressures throughout the Iron
Curtain, Oeausescu adamantly
refused to .give..in to democratic
reform; he managed to slaughter
‘thousands of people in one week.

Later, when the ungrateful Roma-

on trial, he refused to recognize

I am not ashamed to own a

ask about what ‘life was like when
I grew up. Fascinated by how old
I am, the child will ask, “Wow,

Go figure. In the past 10 years
we've had some decent mus-
ings to keep our minds off some
of our more pressing dilemmas
like AIDS, crack and double

entertainment was much like
our food: a ﬂashy package,
served quickly and all pretty
much tasting the same.

It’s telling that according to

, Rolling Stone magazine the two

biggest albums of the final year of
the '80s were Don’t Be Cruel by
Bobby Brown and whatever the

Lack of depth keeps Pitt from being a top-ranked team

By Rob Codispot
Staff Writer

Depth.

Every great team has it. Just
take a look at this week’s AP
rankings —- every school in the
top 10 can go at least eight or

, nine players deep. ‘Last season's

Final Four teams —-— Seton Hall,
Duke, .Michigan and Illinois -'-
could all bring at least three quality
players from the pine. '
Coach Paul Evans’ Pitt Panthers
should have been a great team

this season. Six months ago, they

had all the makings of one.
Returning“ were the top seven

players from last year's 17-13
NCAA tournament squad, plus a
recruiting class labeled Top 10
by virtually every college hoops
publication in the country. The
Panthers had depth.

Then the Fitzgerald Field
House roof slowly started to cave

‘in. T
That world-class recruiting.

class soon became extinct
because of Prop 48. Floor general

Sean Miller was redshirted in

November due to a stress fracture

in his left foot. Then, as if things 

weren't quite bad enough, Rod
Brookin got tangled with a
teammate and dislocated his right

shoulder last Wednesday, just
five minutes before Pitt coaches
were going to end practice.
Pitt’s depth problem has now
plummeted them into the depths
of -the Big East basement. They’ve

,.lost nine games already this

season, including five in a row
and their first four conference
games. The lack of able bodies
has gotten so bad that Steve
Maslek, who quit the team earlier
this season to concentrate on

gacadernics, has been practicing

with the team this week just so
they have enough bodies. The
Panthers will try to gain their first
Big East. win Saturday against

Seton Hall, possibly without
Brookin, who missed last
Saturday's 71-70 loss to St John’s.

That leaves forward/center
Darren Morningstar, forward
Gilbert Johnson and guards Pat
Cavanaugh and Derrick Layton
to the void left by Brookin.
But they're not feeling any

‘ pressure.

“I ‘feel pretty comfortable,”
Morningstar said. “I’ve been
waiting for the chance to start,
and ‘I. don't feel any added

pressure being out there with“

four proven starters. It's real easy

«forme to come in and provide"

the help [the coaches] need."

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Pitt coaches would like more rebounding production from Dan-enMorningstar_, who had three boards against St. John's.

“I just take it the same, whether
we have all our guys or not,”
Cavanaugh said. “I prepare myself
the same way."

Cavanaugh was instrumental
in the Panthers’ late rally against
St John’s, assisting on Jason
Matthews’ three-pointer and
nailing two tneys himself. Assistant
coach Norm Law. said

,Cavanaugh’s» play against the

Redmen should merit him more
playing time on Saturday."

“He'll see a ‘lot more playing
,;am'e," Law said, “because [Seton

~_Halll plays three guards a lot. If

they're playing man-to-man and
they’re playing three guards, then
we’ll have to play three guards."

Morningstar’s starting debut
was less than auspicious. He had

five points, but more importantly ‘

grabbed only three rebounds in
33 minutes against St. John’s big
front line. Point guard Darelle
Porter, whose game is spent
mainly around the perimeter, had
just as many. Morningstar is
demanding much more from
himself this weekend.

‘‘I definitely have to get more

rebounds and keep playing tough
defense undemeath, ” Morningstar
said. “Maybe put a few more
baskets in, too.”

V Law said the coaches would
like to see Morningstar
concentrate on just one aspect of
his game.

“We feel we should get more
than three rebounds,” Law said.
“We’re not particularly concerned
with his scoring. If that comes,
fine. But rebounding and
defensively, if you play 33 minutes

, and are 6-10, if you’re around the

basket where you ought to be,
you should get more than three
rebounds. They ought to be falling
into your hands.”

Morningstar reported that‘ the
team is in good spirits despite the
tough run of luck — or lack of it.
Those spirits may be given a
boost come Thursday. Brookin
will test his shoulder in practice
then, and if all goes well, he may
be available for Seton Hall.

The All-Big East teams throughout the league's /9iSl‘O7j/

The Big East: arguably the best
basketball conference in the
country. Unquestionably, it's the
most watched and the most
successful. Since the dawn ofthe

«idecade, eight different Big East
squads have reached the NCAA
Tournament’s Final Four. Twenty-
-two have advanced as far as the
Final 16.

Naturally, the inﬂuence of the
media, particularly television -
the perfect spouse for the Big
East —-— has greatly contributed to
the Big East's success. But, above
all, what made it all tick were the
players and the coaches. That’s
not a surprise. How else would it
work?

But which players had the
biggest inﬂuence? And in what

capacity? As a tribute to the
wonderful decade that just
recently ended, we decided to
step back in time and find out
who were the ‘league's biggest
tickers of all. After poring over
hundreds of hours of game film,
we now are pleased to present to
you — drum roll and 21-gun
salute, please — the first deca-
annual Big East All-All teams of
the 1980s.

Pitt opens season with loss to PSU

By John Labriola
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team opened its season this past
weekend by hosting Penn State’s
Lady Lions at Trees Hall. The
Lady Panthers lost the catﬁght to
PSU by a score of 178.65 to
175.80.

Coach Debbie Yohman, who is

V starting her fourth season at Pitt,

said that she was pleased with
the performance of her squad.
This year’s team consists of five
freshmen, three sophomores, five
juniors and two seniors.

Yohman also found Penn State’s
team surprising. “I expected them
to be a heck of a lot better then
they were,” said Yohman.

Pitt opened the competition in
vaulting while Penn State started

on the uneven parallel bars.
The highest-vaulting scores for
Pitt were turned in by senior
Shelly Sleith and junior Tina
Taylor, both of whom scored 9.0,
and sophomore Jennifer
Butkovich, who scored 8.95.
“Even though the scores don’t
show it, and we didn’t win, we
looked very good,” stated Sleith.
I “This was just a stepping stone,”
Sleith added. “We showed a lot
of improvements, and it’s very
encouraging.”
Entering into the second event,
the uneven parallel bars, the_Lady
Panthers trailed the Lady Lions

" by 2.50 points. (PSU held 46.95

total points while Pitt held 44.45
total points.)

“Bars are always our weak
event, and [Pitt] probably did
better than I would have

expected," said Yohman.

Pitt’s high scores on the uneven
parallel bars were turned in by
Sleith and freshman Kristin
Brown, both of whom scored
8.75 and junior Kathy Wallish,
who scored 8.45.

For Brown, this was her first
collegiate performance, and it
was against the university’s
largest rival. “If you’re ready for
the meet, it doesn’t matter who
you’re going up against," said
Brown. “It’s just a little added
energy and adrenaline [in] the
meet when it’s your rival.”

At the opening of the third
event, the Lady Panthers were
trailing the Lady Lions by 3.7
points. “We gave them a run for
their money,” said Yohman.
“They had about as much trouble

Penn State 's depth too much for Lady Panthers

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Despite winning nine of the 16
events, the Pitt women’s swim
team was unable to overcome
Penn State's depth and came up
short in Saturday’s dual meet,
160-140.

“The score doesn’t indicate the
kind of meet we had,” said Pitt
Coach David Belowich. “Every
race was close, but unfortunately,
we lost some of the close ones.
We certainly had a focus; we
have nothing to hang our heads
about.”

Penn State did all it could to
pack its swimming facilities with
spectators, thus creating more of
a home—pool advantage for itself.
It was the Lady Lions’ parents’
day. They brought in past All-
Americans to honor them, and

r they had the KBL television crews

in to film the event. To add to
Pitt’s difficulties, it was the Lady
Panthers’ first competition since

the Pitt Invitational held on the’

first weekend in December.

The adverse conditions didn’t
stop Pitt in the first event of the
day, however. The Lady Panthers’
400-yard medley relay team of
Trina Thames, Laura Lee Sullivan,
Julie Rocks and Laure Walczak
blew by the competition winning

the event with a time of 1:48.32.
This is the relay team’s fastest

time of the year so far.

Theresa Picklo kept the
momentum going by winning
the 1,000-yard race. The junior
covered the distance in 10:17.91.
“She’s swimming with a lot of
confidence now and is off to
[the] best start she’s ever had,”
said Belowich.

Penn State took over the lead
after the next event, the 100
freestyle, by taking the top two
places. Thames put Pitt back on
top, winning the 100 backstroke
(59.10). Sandy Albright placed
third.

Karin Masal 7/and Sullivan
extended Pitt’s lead by tying for
first place in the 100 breaststroke
(1:06.SS). Belowich joked that
since this is 9 such a rare
occurrence, the Penn State coach

should have given them both
first-place points instead of nine
points apiece, but the PSU coach
wouldn't go for it.

Despite a PSU win in the 200
butterﬂy by Jen Wilson, Pitt
retained a -slight edge in the
Scoring (S7-55) thanks to Julie
Rocks’ second-place finish. This
was Rocks’ first competition as a
Lady Panther since transferring
from Maryland.

Penn State's depth hurt Pitt in
the S0 freestyle. Walczak
managed a second place, but the
Lady Lions pulled out first, third
and fourth places.

The Pitt divers put the Lady

A Panthers back in the meet. Krissa

Ratliff took first in the 1-meter
board; Donna Flatch took third,
and Nicole Bunker, ﬁfth. “Our
top three divers are three of the
best in the East. On any given
day, one can win and the other
two will be right around the top,”
said Belowich.

Then came some “disaster
events,” as Belowich said. Penn
State took the top three places in
the 100 freestyle.

Thames took second in the 200
backstroke, but Penn State built
up a 105-85 lead after the event.

Masal won the 200 breaststroke,
but once again PSU’s depth came
through, as it took second through
fourth.

The next event Pitt won was
Rocks’ victory in the 100 butterﬂy,
her first win in a Lady Panther
suit The Pitt divers closed the
gap to 141-123 with a Bunker
victory on the 3-meter board.
Flatch took third and Ratliff,
fourth.

Masal recorded her third win of
the day by taking the 200
individual medley. Penn State
ended the scoring by winning
the 400 freestyle relay.
