It was a game only the most
bleary-eyed insomniac could ap-
preciate.
But‘ when the last yawn was stifled
Saturday night, Pitt’s 1974-75
basketball team had tossed and
turned reluctant shooting Ohio
Northern, overcoming their own
a. offensive lethargy ‘en route to a
53-36 win in both team’s debut at
the Field House.

The 'contest's tone was‘ set early
by the,.slow, deliberate Polar Bears.
They worked the ball with tiring
patience. pasing up open outside
shots in hope of getting lay-ups, a
tactic muffled by the Cats’
leech-like defense.

After allowing Ohio Northern to
toy with them for the first eight
minutes, in which the Panthers
only had made three ﬁeld goals.
Tom Richards beat Ohio under-
neath andoutsidc for two straight
hoops. giving Pitt an 11-9 lead. on
which would not be relinquished
for the rest of the night.

Otherwise, Pitt limped through
the first half, shooting an anemic
9for 26 [34.6%], while the Bears
were content to throw only 12 shots
up in the twenty minutes._ ‘

lt's still an annual event.

Joe Patemo’s Penn State Nittany
Lions allowed the Pitt Panthers to
take a halftime lead Thanksgiving
night at Three Rivers Stadium but
then roared back to ﬂatten another
upset bid and successfully defend
their Lambert championship, 31-
10. . , ‘

A national television audience and
45,895 shivering fans _watched the
Panther defense limit the State
offense to a pair of Chris Bahr field
goals in the first half while Pitt

capitalized on a fumbledpunt to set 0

up its only touchdown of the night.
But once the second 'half.com-
menced, it was all Penn State.

Bahr added two more field goals.‘

but the play that broke the Pan-
them’ back was a gift of six points
to the Lions on a fumbled kickoff
early in the final quarter.

State had taken a 19-10 lead on
Bahr’s fourth three-pointer in four
tries when the ensuing kickoff was
juggled by Pitt’s Allen Webster, a
reserve wingback. The ball had

had a scintillating stuff. on

Northem’s Len Ours with :05 left in
the first half that everyone thought
was clean except for the refs. That

play brought ou the most hollering

on the night. ' 3

Coach Buzz Ridl decided to stay
with Bennett for the second half
tip-off, a move that looked good
when the Peabody grad took a Starr
pass from underneath and scored.
Moments later, he just missed on a
play m'ade famous by David
Thompson, as he received Sta'rr’s
pass high above the rim, only to
lose control.

Pitt slowly eased away from ONU
on the strength of two slick passes
inside to Starr and a couple of long
jumpers by Larry I-laris and Kirk
Bruce.

Ridl continued last year’s ritual of
substituting liberally, and two
other new faces besides the
freshmen produced big plays.

Bob Shrewsbury spelled Richards

in both halves and produced two,

stellar assists. And ACC transfer
Ralph McC1elland started acouple
fast breaks with some strong
rebounding.

Ohio Northern was kept in the
ballgame only by ()’4” Junior Al

Don_hoff. He led all scorers with 22 _.

popped into the air and Webster
was blasted by State’s John Bush.

The collision sent the ball spin-
ning into the end zone where Tom
Williams, a reserve defensive line-
man, fell on it for 25-10 PSU lead.
The following two point conversion
failed. .

There was, of course, more to the
second half than just that play. The
performance of Paterno's defensive
front four kept Pitt quarterback
Bob Medwid scrambling and the
rest of the offense off balance.
Mike l-lartenstine and Greg Mur-
phy tore the Pitt offensive line to
pieces and kept them from mount-
ing a sustained drive of any kind.

“He [Murphy] was all over me all
night,” Medwid said after the
game, his last in a Pitt uniform and

- one he wanted to .win badly for

personal reasons. “We’ve always
held respect for the Penn State
defense but I never expected that
much pressure.”,

,The pressure applied by State’s
front four came about by their
constant stunt maneuvering, whiehr
threw the Panthers’ offensive line
off.‘ I - if .

“They bothered us the most by
giving us so many different looks,”.,
said Pitt center, Mike Carey, one
senior who will be playing in a few
more collegiate games, a couple of
all-star tilts, at the end of the
season. “They kept changin

‘down-less

first half, then had
breathing room to spare as the
Lions graciously took a free six
points.

Johnny Majors was of course a
disappointed coach after watching
his crew play one of their more
unspcctacular games of the year.
“Disappointed: yes," he rcliected,
"but I'm still proud of my football
team." A

Paterno, whose teams have had
the running over passing reputa-
tion for quite a while, admitted it
was Shuman‘s strong arm tactics
that added the element missing
from the attack in the first half.

“During the half Tom (Shuman)
came up to me and said, ‘We can
throw on tliem coach,‘ " Paterno
remarked. v,,“Hc was telling me
what to call."

Patcrno was not one to turn a deaf
ear and Shuman did throw--Eaise
rcpcatcd with another touchdown

reception, this time 35 yards." in the’

final quarter to give State its 31-10
victory bulge.

Pitt’s defense suffered two key
blows when starters Don Parrish at
defensive tackle and linebacker
Kelcy Daviston were knocked out of
the game with knee injuries [Par-
rish’s was not that serious] but it

- was not a deciding factor in the

game.

Middle guard Gary Burley, who is
headed towards the_pros, finished
the night with another all-american
performance with five unassisted
and eight assisted tackles. Pitt's
Glenn Hodge and Hartenstine had
seven solo tackles apiece while
State linebackers Rich Kristen and
Greg Buttle led all defenders with
eight.

‘,1.

Connecting to Jim Eaise on passes of 23 and 35 yards for touchdowns,
Shuman added another dimension to the.Penn State offense usually

found to be lacking.

"1 really thought we had a good
chance‘ to win,“ Majors said,
shaking his head, “but they just
came at us with everything,-and
more. ‘And we helped them out,
you can't forget about that.

“They used‘ a variety of forma-
tions and we knew they would,” he
continued, “but it was not like last
year, when they depended on
[John] ‘Cappeletti. They out-
executed us. That's all.”

With the season now nothing but
water over the dam. Majors turned
his attention to the immediate

The Pitt basketball team opened
their 1973-74 basketball season
against West Virginia University
and suffered a heartbreaking 82-78
"loss. Everyone who follows Pitt
basketball knows what happened
after that. The Panthers went on to
win 22 straight games eventually
ending their season as the NCAA
Eastern Regional runner-up.
Perhaps last year’s opening loss
prompted Pitt head coach Buzz Ridl
to schedule an easier opponent for
opening night this year. The
Panthers topped Ohio Northern
Saturday night 53-36 to begin what
could be another very successful
season.

last year's 10-15 season. _
The Mountaineers are led by 6-7

Huggins shoudl Gardner feel it is
necessary. Eartha Fanst who saw
considerable action last year as a
junior will also be used as a
substitute in the guard position.

The biggest reason for WVU's
success on Saturday was their tight
defense that forced the Eagles to
commit 35 turnovers, most of them
in the first half. However. the
Mountaineers had some trouble
holding on to the ball themselves as
they committed over twenty turn-
overs.

The Mountaineers biggest
strength has to be Baker whose
coaches feel hasn't really reached
his full potential.

“Warren can be an AII-Ameri-
can,” says Gardner. “Last year
was a good one for Warren but
nothing like he is capable of. I look
for Warren to show marked
improvement his last two seasons

at wvu."  

“I don't have any personal
goals," said Baker. “I just want to
do my part and help the team to
win. I'm concentrating more than I
ever have on defense and I sort of
enjoy it. This year I hope to
improve by rebounding and sharp-
en by defense--the point scoring
will come as the team comes. I just
Vﬂiltato _help us win.”

 Pens Suffer Inconsistency

BY CONNIE GIEL

Swiss cheese and yogurt have
little to do with hockey except to
lend themselves to comparison.
"We're not sharp, we're full of
holes, we have a poor consisten-
cy," says coach Marc Boileau of his
Pittsburgh Penguins.

“Our biggest problem has been
consistency. We have to play 60
minutes of solid hockey before we
become a really good_ team,”
Boileau said. His criticism is well
taken considering the play of the

__,'*‘gg._-.,\ Penguins’ opponents in Division 3

:",5?x‘~-

//-D-' j

A    

 

of the NHL.

The Pens trail first place Los
Angeles by 13 points, and second
place Montreal by 11. Detroit,
earlier this year involved ina sticky
tie for third place with Pittsburgh,
is now in fourth place with only 16
points.

"The reason Los Angeles is so
successful is because they know
how to move the puck up the ice,"
Boileau explained. “They always
clear the puck, they don't worry
about setting up a play or breaking
one up. And they don't just do it
occasionally, they do it 100% of the
time.

“But we take the puck around the
net when we’re having trouble, and
you lose ground that way. Watch,
we do it time after time, and it
really costs us sometimes.

"Our best game was three weeks

ago against the (New York)

Islanders (home, November 13). It
was the best not because we won
by such a big score, but because
the puck wasn't in“ our end more
than 10 minutes the whole game."

That hasn't been the case in the
Pen's last two home games, last
Wednesday night against Montreal
and last Saturday night against the
Buffalo Sabres. In both games, the
Pens managed only to skate from
end to end, unfortunately usually
without the puck.

Both games were wide open, with
plenty of wild, hard shots, but
concpicuously lacked tight posi-
tional play. This, according to
Boileau, was the major problem a
few weeks back, and now it’s come
back to plague the Pens again. Or
was it ever really gone?

“The guys just won't play the
man instead of the puck. Every-
body tries to do everbody else's job
for them. They cover up instead of
doing their own job and letting the
other guy take care of himself. The
way I see it. if a player can't do his
job and take care of himself, he
won't be here long."

Regarding the positional prob-
lems. Boileau insisted everything
would be fine "if only our guys
would just each pick a man and
then take him out of the play. Then
that guy would be finished and we
could move the puck our way and
follow through."

The Pens seem to have less
trouble when the forwards play
their wing consistently. The wings,
left and right, should remain in

- position, ready for offensive or

defensive play, depending uypon
who has possession of the puck.
When the puck is in the offensive
zone, the center and left or right
wing should go after it. One man
should take the opposing ‘player out
of the play, accordingpto Boileau,
and the other should get the puck
out to the remaining wing, who
should be stationed in the slot,
waiting for the pass. I
The point men, usually a
defensive pair, have heeded
practice drills and remain ' in
position during the games. But the
forwards, responsible for the puck
delivery part of the bargain, just
can't seem to control themselves.
’lnvariab'ly the two wings will
converge upon the center, who is
engaged in his own task.
And just as invariably, someone
from the other team will pick off the
open puck and make off with it,

Ieaving the point men empty-
handed and the forwards skating
frantically up ice to recover from
their misguided enthusiasm.

"We've been making mistakes on
the plays. One mistake per play
would be ok. it's almost expected,
but we make 2. 3, even 4 or S
mistakes on a single play. And
that's with our most experienced
players, not only the rookies."

“You have to realize that the
forwards as well as the defensemen
are responsible for keeping the
opposing team covered. That
means they're also responsible for
the goals scored against us. It's a
shame that the defensemen look
bad when a goal is scored‘ against
us. but that's only because they're
the last ones in front of the goalie."

Boileau explained the duties of
that rarely-seen creature, the
two-way forward. “Of course it
means a guy who plays offense and
defense equally well. It can be a
center or a wing, as I6ng as the guy
can shoot, check, and score.”

Notable exceptions are the Pitts-
burgh forward lines. especially that
of Apps. Pronovost, and MacDon-
ald. They rate high in two
categories. shooting and scoring,
but care little for the other side of
the game.

Center Syl Apps is the leading
goal scorer with 13, and his wings
MacDonald and Pronovost have 8
and 9, respectively. The second
line, _centered by Captain Ron
Schock, has 23 goals between
them, trailing Apps’ 30. Pierre
Larouche’s third "line has the
surprising Bob “Battleship” Kelly
tallying no less than 11 goals and
eight assists.

Larouche himself, the first round
draft choice ofthe Pens, has 7 goals
and ll assists for 18 points, nearly
a point aigame. Fourth center Ron
Lalonde, last season's rookie-of-
the-year for Pittsburgh, has just
three assists and no goals, buthas
seen very little ice time on regular
shifts. .

The big disappointments in the
last few games have been right
wings Chuck Arnason a'nd,.to a,
lesser extent, Rick Kehoe. K‘ehoe's
play, to use Boileau’s term, _is
usually consistent, but Arnasonhasi
had all kinds of trouble.

While his five goals and seven,

assists compile a respectable .12
points, -Arnason sems to have
caught the hard luck syndrome that

Coach Len Ba:-calow was happy
with his team's victory but dis-
appointed in the meager support of
the Pitt fans. “lt’s about time the
University students wake up and
get out and see these games. They
know the schedule and they know
where the tickets are. This is the
greatest bunch of student athletes
ever assembled on blades,” stated
the Panther mentor who is never at

 ‘ It gets a bit tiring, week in and

has progressed inlhis attempt to

gram.

Last 'l‘hursday’s spectacle at

stand as another indicator of the
7 relative talent and success of
respective recruiting programs be-
_ ‘tween the established champion
 and the upstart challenger.

starters; key men in key positions.

I’m not undermining the play of
these individuals by any means.
They have proven their value to
Majors time and time again. But
it‘s still a fact that the one thing
that has slipped through the hands
of Panthers in the last two years
has been the ability to pull off the
big one, to win the most important
games.

Last year it was Notre Dame and
Penn State, and exactly like this
season, Majors came close. but not
close enough.

Coaches say that anything can
happen on any given day and field.
but is it realistic to believe in
upsets when two different classes
of caliber battle each other? How
far has Majors pushed Pitt in the
direction of the Notre Dames and
Penn States‘.’..    j  

When you're talking about the
caliber of a football prospect, it’s
very easy to become mired in a
mess of implicating statements and
relative restrictions. The obvious
difference exhibited in Thursday

night’s game was the outrageous
play of State’s lines--both defen-
sive and offensive.

Forget about Tony Dorsett and
Elliot Walker. Jimmy Cefalo and
Tom Shuman. The real difference
between Pitt and Penn State lay in

' the trenches, where the real work is

done. That is where the success of
a recruiting program, can be
measured.

Paterno, in his quarter of a
century at State. has nothing to
worry about. He is literally
guaranteed an annual crop of top
notch talent to maintain his team’s
top ten status. And he always
comes up with two sets of lines that
can win l-leisman Trophies for no
talent bums and make any fttllbaek
look respectable.

The constant reminder given to us

every Sunday afternoon that Penn

State has 26 graduates in pro
football, almost half of those being
linebackers, is an indication_ of
what talent Paterno emphasizes the
most in recruiting. Get the defense
first, and then worry about finding

a Dorsett or Walker.

Majors immediate problems in
the push to draw national acclaim
for Pitt are worse than the general
consensus might have them at this
point. The holes to fill are plentiful
and the personnel at hand may not
be the best Majors had hoped for at
this time last year. He's losing two
key offensive lineman with a sup-
porting cast of able bodies but
nobody in the wings to handle the
likes of a Hartenstine or Murphy.

Only a freshman and an unproven
Bob Haygood are the prospects for
quarterback. Scratch Gary Burley,
Glenn Hodge, Bruce Murphy. Mike
Bulino, David Spates and a few
starters already mentioned. The
losses are going to be heavy.

With a five year extension on his
contract beginning this year,
Majors has made the committment
to build a national champion at Pitt,
or to at least put the Panthers in
serious contention for it. His
original promise of “pride and
enthusiasm" and “exciting” foot-
ball at Pitt Stadium was only a

temporary goal.

National contenders are not built
on junior college transfers, no
matter how good the individuals
may be. Exciting football teams
with that ability to surprise the gib
teams every now and then might
be. That's what Iowa State was
and what Majors turned Pitt into
over the last two years.

Majors did indeed fulfill his short
range goals, but now he faces his
most rigid challenge--to build a

program that will sincerely rival,

Paterno's.

Personally, I’m not very psyched
about this university overall and I
have constantly. wondered what
motivations high school football
prospects are fed to lure them here.

The exposure Pitt receives still
doesn’t rival any of the nation’s top
teams, despite Majors’ immediate
success. ,

Loealplayers who choose Pitt for
the old “close to home" r_ational
can't seriously be hoping for their
reputations to’ be spread via local
publicity. Pittsburgh just isn't’the
place where that sort of thing
happens.

’l‘here's a lot of,give ‘and take.
. when it comes to the legitimacy of

recruiting in college programs.

The NCAA keeps a watchful eye
over the nation and every now and
then cracks the whip to keep the
big timers in line. Where the
boundaries are on that line is
something every coach and athletic

,l._
.5,»

director ca_n only estimate and hope . j ‘ I.‘

to keep close enough to.

There are certain benefits every
blue chips athlete receives no
matter which school he may choose
to pursue his athletic career. That
is an undeniable fact. What Majors
has to do is make Pittsburgh more
attractive place to play than say,
South Bend Indiana, Southern
California, Alabama, etc.’

.It's not going to happen over-

night. And the remorseful lament’

 

of every Pitt fan ‘at Three Rivers-

'l‘hanks'giving night might not be
heard fora few years to come.

Majors can't be held totally res-
-ponsible for tlietotal Pitt football
program for two more years, when

/every man on the field willjbe a

product of his own
program.

lt‘s been an exciting year. or two
years for that matter. and Majors
and the Pitt football squad have
nothing to hang their heads over.
But I'm feeling nothing but relief
that it's over.
