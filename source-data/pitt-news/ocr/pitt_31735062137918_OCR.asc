Fraternity Rush
Campaign To End
Sunday Morning

 

Rushees Warned By Biddle
Against Fraternity “Sweat-
Boxing” Last Two Days

Fraternity rushing will end at 2
o'clock Sunday morning. The close
of rushing season will climax one of
the most extravagant sequences of af-
fa.irs held in the history of school fra-
ternities. This year's rushing season
so far has been featured by more
dances, smokers and other social af-
fairs than were ever before offered
rushees.

Co—incident with the close of rush-
ing season, silence period will begin
and extend until 5 o’clock next Thurs-
day afternoon. During this period no
fraternity man may spea.k to or ap-
proach any student who ha.s been
rushed by his fraternity. Rushees are
given this time to choose their frater-
nities without any inﬂuence from in-
terested parties.

Men receiving bids will be notiﬁed
by the oiﬁce of the dean of men. They
will be summoned to Roo-m 801, Ca-
thedral, to signify their choice.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men, offered the following advice
to rushees:

"Be on the watch, especially Friday
and Saturday nights, against ‘sweat-
boxing.’ Don’t let any fraternity cor-
ner you in a locked room and feed
you so much ballyhoo that you ac-
cept their pledgeship because of high
pressure methods. Fraternities that
have to resort to ‘sweat—boxing’ meth-
ods show a weakness in their organ-
ization and should not be considered
as a choice for any rushee. There is
a difference between ‘sweat-boxing’

and ‘talking turkey.’ A fraternity
may ‘talk turkey’ by presenting its,
best qualities without high-pressuring!
the rushee. Listen to ‘turkey’ but re—‘
fuse to be ‘sweat-boxed.’ My office is
open at any time to all men wishing
to discuss any matter on the choice
of a fraternity.”

Leslie Johnston Comes, To Defense
Of Pittsburgb’s Mayor At Inquiry

 

By Thomas F. Pellow

Dc-fending Mayor M_cNair as a “man
of unﬂinching courage who possesses
a rare sense of humor,” Director of
Public VVorl;s Leslie J. Johnston de-
scribed his experiences as “Mayor
For a Month” to a packed Inquiry
forum VVednesda.y.

“The Mayor’s job is an extraor-
dinary one. There are always peo-
ple who are trying to tear down the
things one builds. Through my asso-
ciation with Mayor McNair the past
nine months, I have a growing sense
of respect for him,” he stated.

“He has ended the policy of telling
employee how to vote. Under McNair
the police department is being cleaned
up, and since he took office nine
‘months ago there has been no crime
in Pittsburgh as crime is known in
large cities throughout the country.”

Mr_ Johnston was appointed deputy
Mayor during llvlayor McNair’s ab-
sence in September,

Commenting on, Mayor
cabinet, Dr. Johnston said:

“The present_ mayor is particularly

McNair’s

fortunate in having a splendid cabinet
to carry on the work in Pittsburgh,
21 city representing a business invest-
ment of over a billion dollars. It is,
in my opinion, the best cabinet the
city ever had.”

Concerning the recent dismissal of
two members of the civil service com-
mission, Mr. Johnston explained:

“They were dismissed because they
allowed politics to interfere with the
business of the commission.”

The "immora.l” conditions in city
Darks also drew ﬁre from the director.
He exclaimed:

“Tliey have been turned over to the
rabble. It is hardly safe for a woman
to walk through them. This condi-
tion, however, can be remedied and
will be remedied.”

Vxlard chairmen also received a bar-
rage.

“A political organization must ha.ve
ward chairmen, but those who have
dominated Pittsburgh politics have
continuously sought beneﬁts for them-
selves and their party, disregarding
the needs of the city.”

Accommodations For Activities

Membership in the various groups

dations for all activities threaten to

day luncheon clubs report enrollment

The upperclass organizations, while;
not so crowded as the first year units,-

l‘Doodads’ Resembling
Cameras Measure
Cathedral

If you see a bunch of boys in front
of the Cathedral pee-ring very earn-

estly through long black camera-
shaped doodads, don't get excited;
your picture isn’t being taken.

They're only measuring the height of
the Cathedral, and it’s a regular ex-
periment in physical optics, according
to Dr. Wilfred N. St. Peter, professor
of physics.

Charles Thornton, C37, one of the
measurers, claims‘ that the height of
the Cathedral changes frequently,
what with building blocks being
tacked on. Its approximate height,
however, is 540 feet, and most of the
students measure or say they measure
somewhere near the right answer.

And if you go across the street,
_vou’ll find two more physical optics
students, Nellie and Jean. squinting
through  telescope at the Mellon in-
stitute. Some very obliging young
man holds a board in front of the-.Iu
with ﬁgures on it, and in some com-
plicated way the board makes all the
difference in the experiment.

Both Teams Set
For Tough Fight
ln ‘Natural’ Tilt

Jones Revises Trojan Lineup;
Sutherland To Start Same
Men As Last Saturday

Tomorrow afternoon at“2’o’clock a
referee in white knickers will blow a
blast upon his whistle. That blast.
will be heard from coast to coast. It
will send into action two of the most
colorful and potentially powerful foot-
ball teams in the country, Pitt’s Pan-
thers and Southern California’s Tro-
jans.

For Southern Cal, it will be an op-
portunity to prove to the world that
their defea.t at the hands of Wash-
ington State last week was all a mis-
take. In addition, the Trojans will be
ﬁghting to uphold a tradition of never
having lost a game to an intersection-
al rival other than Notre Dame. "For
Pitt, the game offers a stepping stone
on the way to a most successful foot-
ball season. 

The Panthers, likewise, have an-
other interest in the game. That is
the matter of atoning for a couple of
New Year’s presents in the form of
47-14 and 35-0 defeats. Whatever ad-
ditional ﬁre the Pitt gridders may
need, memories of those two contests
ought to fan it well.

Aside from these outside causes
which lend the game a big—league as-
pect and give it the term of “a nat-
ural,” the fact that both teams are
yet a couple of large and well—deﬂned
question marks makes tomorrow’s
stadium battle loom as the outstanding
one on the gridirons of the nation.
Southern Cal, a team which can put
on the,ﬁeld a capable line averaging
207 pounds to the man, has yet to
show that winning spark which critics
believe to be lurking somewhere in
its makeup. Pitt. even in the rather
handy win over West Virginia, offers
no indications that there is much
power in the backfield for plays out-
side of the guards.

Before the ‘Nashington State game,
Southern Cal’s record included two
victories over a duo of anemic ball
clubs in an opening day double-header
and a. rather sloppy 6-0 win over Old
Man Stagg’s College of the Paciﬁc.
None of these three exhibitions set

Los Angeles on ﬁre. Pitt’s other

Coach Howard Jones ha.s so many
methods of shifting his squad around
that predicting a Southern Cal line-
up is something akin to guessing at
styles for women’s winter hats. ‘While

dugoslav Council Defends
Slain King As ‘Democrat’

Kosto Unkovich Scores Louis Adamic, Author, For Bitter
Attack On Alexander; Prophesies Future Peace

Defending the assassinated King
Alexander of Jugoslavia. as one of the
“most democratic rulers of Europe,”
Kosto Unkovich, Jugoslavian consul
here, reiterated his belief in the fu-
ture unity and peace of his country in
an exclusive interview with the Pitt
News yesterday.

Flaying the author, Louis Adamic,
who assailed the late king as an “au-
tocrat and tyrant.” Mr. Unkovich ex-
Claimed:

“The prosperity of his people was
King Alexander's greatest ambition.
Their welfare was ever uppermost in
his mind.”

Mr. Unkovich denied King Alexan-
der drew a $1.000,000 a year salary for
his own beneﬁt. He said:

“The king contributed over $100,000
every year to Jugoslav universities
for the education of poor students.
King Alexander did not describe him-
self as a Serb; he was a Jugoslav and
as such wasiz; one of the most demo-
cratic rulers in Europe.

“Louis Adamic never really knew
the king. He associated entirely with
people who were against the mon-
arch.”

Commenting on future trouble, Mr.

Unkovich asid:

“There will be none. The Croa-
tians, contrary to what newspapers
say, were 99 per cent behind the king.
I see no trouble in the kingdom.”

The assassination was not an ex-
pression of a dissatisﬁed people, ac--
cording to the consul. He explained:

“The assassination was an act of a
political enemy. It was not sanction-
ed by the Croatian people. This was
easily proved by the fact there were
no clemonstrations. The government
was not forced to declare martial
law.”

Mr. Unkovich described Jugoslavia’s
friendship with France as due to po-
litical turmoil in Europe. He said:

“Jugoslavia holds the balance of
Dower there today. Surrounded by a,
circle of unfriendly nations——-Italy,
Austria, Hungary and others—it had
to turn to a larger power.”

Describing them as “one and the
39-1719 Deople.” Mr, Unkovich scored
the idea that only fear of Italy binds
the Juvoslavs as a nation. :

“'l.‘h.ere is no threat of war,” Mr.l
Unkovich said. “There was no dis-
order and will be none in the future.

“The next few weeks will prove
the truth of what I say,” he concluded.

Cream Of Wheat Dollars

A a class of 50 students, neither
brighter nor duller than the

usual class of 50 students, how
many would be willing to affix
their signatures to a contract en-
titling them to $3,600 a year for
life. The provisions of the con-
tract would make clear that the
annual income would never fall
short of, nor exceed that amount

_ as long as the student lived. Only

-one of the students, and that one
a girl, showed 21 willingness to
enter such a bargain.

The teacher smiled, he looked
-over the students seated before
him, and he didn’t know whether
to laugh or cry. No wonder. Ac-
cording to general University sta-
tistics, 25 of those 50 students
were meeting at least a part of
their tuition with “promise to
pay” notes; a former occupant of
one of those chairs, who had since
earned a Ph.D. after his name,
had advertised in a local paper
that he would do anything decent
for room and board; many of that
class had been in the mob turned
away from the employment office
of a large downtown department
store which had advertised for
University students to Work for
35 cents an hour. No wonder the
teacher smiled at such dollar op-
timism. He would have laughed
out loud, and even led a cheer for
their courage could he but see the
ham sandwiches pulled from
paper bags and swallowed hur-
riedly between classes, the paper
lining the soles of so many of the
shoes stretched out in front of
him, the brightest pupil in the
class on his daily ﬁve—mile jaunt
to and from school.

BUT THE answer to the query
should have rated an A from
the viewpoint of home training,
even if the answer was, according
to economics, leaning toward a
failure. The “ get—rich-quick” good
old American doctrine, the “get
rich,” better American slogan,
that they had learned ever since
they hadpmastered the sound of
their mother’s voice was at last
crashing through. That the good
old United States is a free coun-
try, that opportunity abides for
everyone to grow rich and fa-
mous, irrespective of color, race,
or creed, that success lies waiting
for them around the corner, was
fed to them along with the scald-
ed milk on their cream of wheat.
They were taught to look at Rock-
efeller, and Edison, Henry Ford,
and Abraham Lincoln as exam-
ples of poor boys who made good,
even before they were taught that
ﬁve pennies not spent is a nickel
saved. No matter what the size
of the pay check father brought
home on Saturday nights, they
received along with the bag of
candy and the fatherly hug, the
comment that when they were
big, a check this size would be
mere “bag of candy” money.
- When they grew older and suf-
ﬁciently wise to understand that
the shine on their blue serge suits
couldn’t be brushed off, they were
‘given the idea that the era of
shiny suits would soon pass, and
the era of custom-made suits
would begin. And once they were
in college, they were lulled to
sleep nightly, between tales of the
sacriﬁces that were being made
to send them, that it was but a
stone’s throw from the Com-
mencement platform to the seat
on the stock exchange, or the
presidential mansion at \Vashing-
ton, that their degree would be a
key to social and ﬁnancial suc-
cess. Once all this may have been
true. But along with the cream
of wheat, should have gone a lit-
tle advice about the world that
was overcrowded, and overpro-
ducing, the world that was not
tossing out $3,600 a year con-

tracts for life.

Pittwick Papers

By Alan Lloyd

Now that I have been at Pittsburgh for a week, I can really thank
The curriculum and training need no dis-
cussion; but the spirit of the school, the texture of the classrooms,
the reﬁnement of the buildings—all these make one intensely proud

You used to brag about your school days here, when they had
merely ﬁnished the outside of the Cathedral.

go to the Paciﬁc Coast. But all that
IS trivial now, compared to what I as
a freshman have before me.

Despite the fact that every newspa-
per and every newsreel has a picture
of the Cathedral in it, owing to some
educational conference or research
discovery there, and despite the fact
that it is well known as the offices of
the Superintendent of American
Learning Institutions, you and the rest
of the general public scarcely realize
the marvels a single building can con-
tain. And here I refer to the Cathe-
dral, of course. .

VVhen you started here in 1932, none

of the corridors was ﬁnished, none of
the rooms completed, none of the
arches formed to amaze you. Stacks
of stone and tile were piled on all
sides, and a shed containing ahoisting
engine blocked the view from the
Fiftli avenue corridor into the Com-
mons room, you used to tell me. And
the galleries of the second and third
ﬂoors were bare. with steel and con-
crete beams in plain sight. But now,
to look at the Cathedral, (that name
was excellently chosen) it is hard to
conceive of anything crude or unﬁn-
ished_ The whole interior has a lustre
andspaciousness that gives an atmos-
phere which discredits all the com-
men, the vulgar, and the boisterous.
r VI-HS COMI‘/IONS ROOM, most of
all, is fascinating. Inside it, above
are two long arches, and all around
the sides, the walls are modeled into
large pointed arches. Each arch is
divided into subarches, and those!
again into still smaller ones, until it
seems that you are looking through
old Episcopal church windows. You
can see nothing at all of the other
floors, so careful is the architecture,
unless someone passes the windows
which open into each of the upper
corridors. From above you look down
into the room, but we below can see
nothing but the arches.
Last evening the Chancellor and
the national secretary spoke to us in
this hall. VVe two thousand freshman
men and women had been given a din-
ner, and when we were ﬁnished, we
sang the school songs while the ta-
bles were removed. After an inter-
val, we reassembled there and all the
lights were turned out in the main
room, while the corridors were lit up
with golden lights. The effect was
awe-inspiring. I felt again that I was
in 3. church, for above me was the
lofty arched nave, and about me were
thousands of pointed windows glowing
with sunshine, The light fell in long
beams upon us, lighting up faces here
and there. We pressed toward the
lights. _

MMEDIATELY, EXCEPT for a fant

rustle of garments, dead silence
ensued. We were quite stricken with
the feeling of respect that the ancients
must have known when they viewed
the miracles of Christ. In the midst
of us, a light grew stronger about a
dais, and from there the two men
spoke. What they said mattered lit-
tle, for. even had they ranted and
stormed at us we would have felt only
a glow of honor and determination.
It seems, odd, but when-‘I look at one
of our massive pillars, and too, when
Icrecall the feel of those golden lights
streaming into the Commons room,
I know» a real urge to get up and do
something, Something ﬁne and hon-
orable, as write a famous treatise,
discover a new serum, or become a
great scholar. VVhen I feel restless in
my dormitory in Alumni hall, I walk
down to the Cathedral, and when I
come back I can study.

I realize now why Pitt. students
ha.ve become the moral as well as the
intellectual leaders of America in the
past decade: they have unknowingly
dedicated themselves to the spirit
and ideals the Cathedral has cast upon
them,

There are a thousand and one in-
teresting things about this temple.
You have asked that I write to you
about them, and so will I do every
week_

In answer to a generally popular
question,-I.offer this: Summer school
had enrolled on campus 2,256 persons,
and 321 on extension, for a total of
2,577 individuals who worked at the
University this summer.

 Aha, Victory!
THE TRIUMPH of every writer
lies in having some attention paid
to what he has written. Hence, mo-
mentarily at least, I am exulting in
my glory. As a sequence of my re-
marks about Paul Best and John
Adams in last Wednesclay’s Pitt News,
two downtown papers sent photogra-
phers out here to catch the boys. It
took them a day and a half to locate
them both, and then they watched the
birdie. You are welcome, gentlemen.

Novelty At Grid Game

Pitt students will be selling a new
football novelty at the game tomor-
row. The novelty, originated by Pitt
men, consists of 3. blue feather with
“Pitt” lettered on it with gold water-
proof paint

The feather is a timely, smart
looking article and no doubt thou-
sands of them will beworn by the
Pitt and Southern California specta-
tors.

tudent salesmen will be selling
them on the campus and at the game

the German professor, “do not mean

“The Nazi party was closed to new

Fresizman Football Team

Opens Season October 20 

Coach ‘Skip’ Gougler’s freshman
team will open the 1934 season on
October 20, meeting the Carnegie
Tech plebes in the Tech bowl. The
Pant11.3y cubs will be out to revenge
the defeat they suffered at the hands
of the Tech team last year. The Tar-
tans were the only team to defeat the
Pitt freshmen last season.

The starting line-up for the opening
game is still undecided. Coach
Gougler will be watching the play of
the entire squad closely in the next
two weeks of practice before he de-
cides on the team to line up against
the Tartans, .

John Michelosen, who suffered a

broken nose in a scrimmage play last 

week may be ready to start at quar-

terback_ Should Michelosen be unable; 
to play, Gougler will be forced to ' 7»

Both Teams Set
For Tough Fight

(Contined From Page One.)

on the jaunt across the country, Jones
has been most interested in locating
a good guard to lead interference.
Cal Clemens, the
blocking halfback, did a short shift
at the job but was eventually return-
ed to his post in the backﬁeld. Jones
is trying every method in the bag to
patch together a winning combination
to show against the Panthers. . Report.
has it that a 195-pound sophomore
named Russell Powers. who has never
played one minute of a varsity game,
may be in the lineup against Pitt._

Coach Jock Sutherland plans to
start the sa.me eleven which began
both the Wash-Jeff and West Virginia
games_ This will have Rocker and
Baxter at the ends; Hoel and Detzel,
the tackles; Ormiston and I-Iartwig,
the guards; and Shotwell at center.
Whatever may be Jones’ starting line,
it is a sure bet that they will out-
weigh the Panthers plenty. This feat-
ure may minimize Pitt gains through
the line and will direct the Panther
attack more at the ends and tackles.
The starting backﬁeld will be made
up of Munjas at quarter, Nicksick and
LaRue at the halfbacks, and Wein-
stock at fullback.

One of the prophesied bright spots
of the game may materialize in a duel
between Southern Cal's Cottontop
Warburton and Pitt’s Heinie Weisen-
baugh. The mighty mite from the
coast; whose work in pa.st years has
gained him all-American recognition,
hasn’t been doing enough running this
year to cause even a slight ﬂurry out
west. Tomorrow might well be the
Cotton’s day to explode himself all
over the ﬁeld and if he does, then
the Panther ends had better be very
much in the ball game. Like VVarb,ur-
ton, Weisenbaugh is the Pitt ace-in-
the-hole. Heinie has already started
his year off in grand style and a rep-
etition of his performances during the
past two Saturdays will give Warbur-
ton a run for the money, no matter
What.

To give fans a full afternoon of
football, arrangements have been
made for the junior teams of Shady-
side and Arnold to put on a battle
during the intermission at the half.
Such a game was played last year
and caused much good comment from
the stands.

’gO’iLoughlin And Kern
Hope To See New
Sport Added

 

A new sports, squash, may be added]
to the list of athletic activities of the‘
University, according to Dr. David
O’Loughlin, coach of the tennis team.

While no deﬁnite plans have been
made, it is hoped by William Kern
and Dr. O’Loughlin, that enough in-
terest will be aroused within the Uni-
versity to have a team representing
Pitt in the second division of the lo-
cal club league. In that event, Pitt
would meet the “B” teams of PAA,
Pittsburgh Golf club, Edgeworth, and
the Keystone Athletic club.

Out of the organization of a squash.
team may also come a. local college
league with Tech and Duquesne.

Being a very economical sport, an
inter-class“ organization is possible.
The game takes about but an hour to
play, so that students having a couple
of hours to spare could easily aﬁord
the time to take a good workout.

Either the PAA or the Keystone
Club courts will be available for play
if the idea can be worked out in a
satisfactory manner.
