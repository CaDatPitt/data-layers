WQED films
Nabokov lectures

in Pitt’s Cathedral

By Brian Lee
The Pitt News

A lecture hall on the third floor of
the Cathedral of Learning this week-
end was transformed into a 1954
Cornell University classroom as
WQED began production on
“Nabokov in Residence," a pilot
program for the Public Broadcast-
ing System» starring Christopher
Plummer. Scores of area college stu-
dents, outfitted in bobby socks and
saddle shoes, pony tails and DA’s,
made the transformation possible.

The program is a recreation of a

lecture presented by Vladimir“

Nabokov, the Russian emigre
author and poet, while he was an
author in residence at Cornell in the
19505.

“We wanted to shoot the class-
room scenes in Pittsburgh because
its home for us,” said David Gerber,
the production manager. “Our pro-
ducer, James Fleming, chose the
classroom for the look — it looked
like it could have been Cornell in
19.55’

So a casting call went out to area
university drama, film and fine arts
departments to find the students for
the classroom. An estimated 150 stu-
dents from Pitt, CMU, Duquesne
and even high school responded to
this rare opportunity to be a part ofa
major television production. A
drama major at the Catholic Univer-
sity of America came all the way
from Washington, DC. for the
chance to participate.

But due to production problems,
the students were kept waiting over
five hours for that opportunity.
Some passed the time sampling the
coffee and doughnuts provided, oth-
ers studied, and many more watched

Editor's note: This is the second ofa
two-part series on the plight of Ethi-
opian Jews and Israel’s involvement
in Operation Moses to evacuate
them from the impoverished and
starving Big Horn of Africa.

The first installment ran Friday,
detailing Shlomo Shoham’s first-
hand experiences with the newcom-
ers in his hometown of Sefat, one of
several absorption centers in Israel.
Shoham, a shaliach (community
ambassador), has been in Pittsburgh
two months.

transition.)

All along, Israel’s friendly foreign
relations with former Emperor
Haile Selassie precluded any exodus
for the Ethiopian Jews to avoid any
signs of internal instability. Then,
five years ago, after Selassie’s regime
toppled to Marxist and communist
control in the mid-l9"/Os, plans were
laid to begin the mass exodus.

The Israeli commitment has yet to
lay to rest unyielding speculation as
to whether Ethiopian Jews are actu-
ally Jewish. Shoham refuses to call it
racism.

of the Ethiopians ’

“There has been in the last I50
years the questioning of the Jewish-
ness of many Jewish groups,” Sho-
ham said. “You must check: Are
these guys originally Jews as every-
one? Even if they are, there IS a
second question. Along history, do
they keep the Jewish habits? About
this question, the Ethiopian Jews
have been strict [in upholding the
tenets of the faith]. I think the ques-
tions can be answered positively."

Conversely, Shoham is not so sure
what effect the completed integra-
tion will have on the Ethiopians now
in transition. Theirs, he commented,
is a faith unlike that of any other
Jews around the world.

“They have a very — strange is not

the word — but their ways of servi-
ces are unlike ours. They have differ-
ent kinds of services. This is what
I’m afraid of. Israel has a tendency
to destory past cultures, like the
Sephardic culture, and it’s happen-
ing again in front of our eyes. [The
Israelis] have good will, teachingthe
people. There’s a very big danger in
front of our eyes. Very soon, they
can be put in our society. Very little
attention is paid to their tradition.
The intentions are good because
[Israelis] are trying to integrate them
fast.”

It is believed large monetary
transfers to Ethiopia paved the exo-
dus’ way before the Soviet Union
became aware of the airlift. And

the television monitor as Chris-
topher Plummer rehearsed and
taped his lines.

All but the absolutely essential
crew members were ordered off the
set as Plummer alternately brooded
or paced to and fro. He began a
recitation as the students gathered
about the monitor. ‘

“Read the bloody thing off the
teleprompter you (expletive
deleted),” exploded Plummer, chas-
tising himself after he flubbed a line
of dialogue. “God! I’ve got to get
that right or I'll ruin the whole tape.”

Plummer walked out of the pic-
ture. The students listened as he
rehearsed the line that prompted the
outburst.

“Speed tape,” commanded the
director, Peter Medak. ‘

“Slate 610,” said a technician into
a headset.

“Action.”

Plummer and Medak repeated
this sequence time and again, after
each shoot reviewing the perfor-
mance in the monitor in search of
some nuance only they could see.

As the hours slowly went by, graf-
fiti filled the’ chalkboard. Many
complained but few went home.

As the students tiled into the class- 4

room set at long last. Plummer was
off in the corner, chin in hand. After
the seats were filled, the taping could
begin. Medak gave thestudents only
two directives.

“Just be yourselves," he said, “and'

never look into the camera because
it screws everything up.”

“This is terrific,” said Plummer

between takes. “When I was per-
forming without an audience I wor-
ried that my performance was too
dry or too stodgy. But with the kids

srael

Shoham added that Israeli-Soviet
relations are at one of the lowest
points in recent years.

So what is in store for those Jews
still stranded in Ethiopia?

“l was never so blind to tell you
that whatever the Israeli govern-
ment does is OK,” he admitted. “I
wouldn’t mind knowing the details
[of Operation Moses], but leave it to
the end. But the more important
thing is the fact that the lift stopped.

“The problem is: Do we accept
them as Jews? Do we try to budget
their integration? Do we pay atten-
tion to their culture and not destroy
it? Do we also see they’re human
beings and relate to them as such?
Will they become citizens of Israel?”

The Pitt: News,iMoinday, January] lcl, I985

Survey shows job outlook is improving

(MANPOWER) — The job out-
look across the country should
extend recent growth patterns dur-
ing the first quarter of I985 accord-
ing to a nationwide survey released
by Manpower, Inc. The survey of
lI,500 business ﬁrms taken each
quarter shows that 20 percent of
those interviewed plan to increase
their work force, slightly below the
22 percent of last year, while 12 per-
cent anticipate reducing staff, the
same percentage as last year.
Another 64 percent will remain at
present levels, and 4 percent don't
know.

Manpower President Mitchell S.
Fromstein observed, “A key factor
in the hiring forecast is less than
usual post-holiday staff reduction.
The number of firms intending to
reduce staff in the coming quarter is
equal to the lowest in the nine-year
history of the survey. This indicates
a stability in the overall job out-
look.” He said, however, that the
major job growth is predicted in the
white-collar areas of services, public
ad_ministration, and finance, insur-
ance and real estate. Manufacturing
sectors show a considerably slower

rate of growth than for the first
quarter of 1984.

“These indications are not sur-
prising,” Fromstein commented.
“They follow a strong trend of recent
years toward more white-collar jobs
and the present dip in factory
employment follows seven quarters
of abnormally high levels in the
manufacturing sectors.”

Fromstein said that the very
strong hiring plans in the ﬁnancial
sector reflect a narrow supply of
clerical, secretarial and administra-
tive workers available in major
markets, particularly in the financial
cente_rs of the Northeast. “The
demand for office workers has been
exacerbated by the rapid pace of
conversion to automated office sys-
tems," Fromstein said. “These sys-
tems initially require additional staff
as well as new skills. There arejust
not enough skilled office workers to
meet the demand."

Declining hiring in the wholesale-
retail and construction industries
reflects the strong seasonal trend
that traditionally makes the first
quarter the weakest of the year in
terms ofjob prospects.

Geographically, the South con-
tinues to show the healthiest outlook
and the Midwest forecasts the lowest

growth rate. Fromstein said the,

regional patterns extend the trend of
recent quarters and reflect the
slower growth in midwest manufac-
turing. The Northeast is looking for-
ward to its most favorable first
quarter in the survey’s nine-year his-
tory, while the hiring outlook in the
Western area is below normal.

Construction

Suffering its normal seasonal
plunge in the Northeast and Mid-
west, the construction industry will
be relatively flat in its employment
outlook nationally, although most
opportunity exists in the southern
states. The results extend the trend
first apparent in the previous
quarter.

Manufacturing

Levels of hiring intentions among
manufacturers are below any quar-
ter since early I983, after nearly two
years of active, post-recession work
force buildup. Both durable and
non-durable goods companies have
decelerated their hiring plans, a
trend particularly evident in the
Midwest. Non-durable goods manu-
facturing is notably weak in the
West. t

Wholesale-Retail

The wholesale-retail sector nor-
mally drops from its employment
rolls the multitude of extra holiday
season employees during the first
quarter. This usually results in a
sharp drop in jobs in this sector, but
the decline for the coming quarter is
not as precipitous as in prior years.
As was the case a year ago, as many
firms in this sector expect to add
staff as those who will trim the
number of employees.

The outlook is best in the North-
east where a record high 22 percent
of firms interviewed expect to
increase employment in the coming
three months compared to only 17
percent planning cuts.

Public and Private Education

Continuing momentum built over
the past year-and-a-half opportuni-
ties in the education sector continue
to be rather bright for this time of
year. Not since 1979 has a first quar-
ter been as optimistic. In the coming
three months, 12 percent of educa-
tional employers will be hiring. Only
4 percent expect to record declines.

Public Administration

Led by aggressive hiring activity
in the Northeast and South, public
administration jobs hold one of the
brightest pictures in the economy.

growing new companies, based in Pittsburgh, offering career
opportunities in robotics, computer software, CAD/CAM,

This is due in part to a reluctance to
decrease staff. Not since late I977
have fewer employers planned staff

‘ decreases. At the same time, 20 per-

cent plan additions, approaching the
high levels of hiring that existed
throughout 1984. Among public
administration employers in the
Northeast, 22 percent plan additions
and only 4 percent will cut back. In
the South, 23 percent plan staff
increases, while 5 percent anticipate
declines.

Services

Job opportunities among services
firms conform closely to those of a
year ago. At the beginning of the
year, 8-l0 percent of services
employers customarily plan declines
and the 9 percent recorded this year
is no exception. However, the 22
percent planning to increase staff is a
bit stronger than seasonal patterns
have indicated in recent years.

Finance, Insurance and Real Estate

The brightest picture on the first
quarter job scene belongs to the
finance, insurance and real estate
sector. Among those interviewed, a

robust 24 percent expect to hire

additional workers, while only 6 per-
cent forecast staff declines. The
strength is evident almost uniformly
in all geographic regions. The new
outlook‘ reflects highly positive
employment growth among these
companies extending -back three

years.

 Writer  to talk on the
 black experience

By Christopher L. Wells
The Pitt News

As part ofthe university's contin-
uing Contemporary Writer’s Series,
black author and poet John A.
McCluskey Jr. will speak on “The
Experience of Black America, Past
and Present” Wednesday at 8 p.m. in
room 501 Cathedral of Learning.

Born in Middleton, Ohio, in 1944,
McCluskey showed early promise as
a writer, winning a city-wide contest
as a third grader. It wasn’t until well
into his collegiate career at Harvard
that he began taking courses that
would contribute to his develop-
ment into a mature writer. It was
about this same time that McClus-
key found his focus — the black
experience - stimulated by the civil .
rights activism of the 1960s.

The author began writing poetry
about black culture for “both per-
sonal and extraneous reasons” dur-
ing his first year as an English
instructor at Miles College in Bir-
mingham, Ala. He refers tothis time
as his “growing up year” and notes
that “reading classics [while at
Miles] struck a care” within him and
served as a catalyst for the serious
study of black history and culture.

Following his contribution of the
“The Pilgrims" to a collection of

short stories published as “What We '

Must See: Young Black Story-
tellers,” McCluskey moved to Cali-
fornia and earned his masters degree
in Creative Writing/English from
Stanford University in 1972. He
went from Stanford to Case-
Western Reserve University in Ohio
to accept a position as a professor of
Afro-American studies. Most
recently, McCluskey became asso-
ciate dean of the graduate school at
Indiana University (Bloomington).
Currently at work on two short
stories and a pair of novels, one “sort

of a funny book" about a quasi-‘
religious cult, McCluskey notes that
“in most of my work, history is
becoming very important."

He feels that his work is political
in a way that affirms the black com-
munity. He asserts that blacks create
a political force when black writers,
acting as representatives of the com-
munity, affirm the strength of black
culture and experience in contem-
porary America. He aspires to fol-

low in the tradition of very strong _

black writers who have made areal
impact within his culture.

While he has no current plans for
an autobiography, McCluskey plans
on writing a biography of noted
black musician Lee Gunther.

An open reception will follow
McCluskey’s address. His appear-
ance in the Contemporary Writer’s
Series is co-sponsored by the Writ-
ing Program of the University of
Pittsburgh’s Department of English
and the Black Studies Department.

Cronies at Pitt

The administration would have us believe that the University
of Pittsburgh has fallen on hard financial times. In a ﬂurry of
excitement over just what to do, about this dreadful state of
affairs, the administration attempted to anesthetize the univer-
sity with a five-year planning document while running about
with scalpels. First there was talk of cutting the entire CAS
budget by fully 25 percent thereby eliminating the Advising
Center, the Writing Workshop, and other free-to-the-students
services. Then there was the announcement to the press that the
Graduate School of Public International Affairs (GSPIA) was
to be eliminated. Shortly thereafter, the administration
announced that the School of Pharmacy, which has 100 per-
cent placement rate, is also to be eliminated. What clearer
evidence of financial hardship could the students at large
require?

They require specifice figures. It strains the administration’s
credibility for them to shout, “We must be austere! We must be
austere!” while at the same time continuing conspicuous nepot-
ism. Not only has most of the present administration been hired
under questionable circumstances, but even now during an
ﬂrtiflblﬂlly liitltibetl state Bffinaneial panic, questionable hiring
practices continue. We refer specifically to the case of the
School of Health Sciences.-

Only two months ago, Thomas Detre was hired as the

a school’s new vice president. He was hired in the conspicuous

absence of any search for other qualified professionals to com-
pete for the position. His hiring was, according to the school’s
constitution, illegal as well as unethical, as a national search is
required before any replacement may be appointed to that
post. Now, after only two months of controversy surrounding
his appointment, an even more suspicious hiring has occured.

“ Jeffrey Romoff, who served under Dr. Detre at Western Psy-

chiatric Institute and Clinic (W.PIC) as recently as September,
is now going to serve under Dr.Detre again. This time at the

University of Pittsburgh. This time, we, the undergraduate.

student body, are paying his salary.

Surely, the administration does not believe that the under-
graduate student body doesn’t mind buying jobs for the admin-
istrator’s cronies while losing valuable services which are its
reasons for attending Pitt? In order to cast aside confusion
concerning the administration’s intentions and goals for the
university, we request that the university’s offices of business
and finance and administration produce honest and detailed
ﬁgures constructing their budget for public inspection and
discusion. Failing this, we can only conclude that the adminis-
tration_ has not acted in good faith and with valid intentions
toward securing a place for free intellectual exchange, but with
malice and the intention to decieve.

Letters to the Editor

A Day in
the Life

The University of Pittsburgh in its
grandeur has presented me, as a stu-
dent, with many moments of feeling
unwanted or uncared about. The
large number of students that attend
this sub-par university help me only
to understand one of the problems
here —- parking. As far as the rest of
the hassles, Pitt has given me the
f :eling that it has become more of a
place of employment than a place of
higher education.

Teachers — Last terml had a gen-
eral writing class with a TA, fine, no
problem yet, until grades came out.
The writing workshop people
thought my papers were good, well
above the C- average that my profes-
sor thought. At mid-terms there was
only one A in the class, a kid who
attended semi-annually and was
almost illiterate but belonged to the
same fraternity as the teacher.

Another instance arose last term
when, being the average Pitt stu-
dent, I cheated on a test with a
friend. Mostly an essay test, our
answers were almost verbatim.

’ While he got an 86, I received only a

70; we had different recitation
teachers. And speaking of recitation
teachers, two of my recitation
teachers are fresh off the boat. I
admire them for coming hereto
learn and excel, but recitation is sup-
posed to clear up problems you have
with class. I get more confused lis-
tening to the garbled English in reci-
tation than I do in class with an
English-speaking professor. Those
of us who are in this boat should
receive credit toward our foreign

. cultures requirements.

Administrators and other higher
echelon -—- Last year, while receiving
a refund (surprise), which I might
add came two months after the date
on the check and on which they even
spelled my name wrong, I was told
by one of the desk people in Thack-
eray to wait in the line in G-I2. After
the wait, I was sent back to the same
lady (after being informed that I
should have gone there first). She
accepted me with open arms and
asked if she could help me. When I
asked her why she sent me through
that line, she told me she had been
on break and didn’t want to be inter-
rupted. Thanks for nothing. While
trying to get a registration appoint-
ment with my advisor, I left a note
on his door (as usual, he wasn’t in) to
call me when he did arrive. I’m a very
busy person -— school, work, study,
etc. Never receiving his call, I went
to see him, finding out he was
booked until December (it might as

well be I996). I have come to learn
that his office hours (from past expe-
riences) are from 11-1 1:15 a.m. and
l-1:10 p.m., 25 minutes, not quite
office hours, more like office
moments. All but one of my classes
“are closed, much to my advisor’s sur-
prise, and it’s not even close to
December yet. I’m changing my
major to football anyway. That way,
I can take Bus Watching 10 (how
many Pitt students can you see get
hit by a PAT bus in one day and
report on it), and Vocabulary 20 (the
eloquence of interview and what to
say to The Pitt News to make the
stereotype of the dumbjock seem all
the more valid).
Parking —— Well, forget that,
that’s impossible around here
anyway.

Towers Cafeteria -— Well, we who i

live here know all about that. The
utensils and plates are never clean.
It’s too much work to clean them, so
just run them under water or set
them near it, maybe they’ll clean
themselves. At a major (or sup-
posedly that) university, you figure
that the food would be semi—decent
(with the money we pay). Well, guess
again. This is the only place I know
‘in the world, besides Mexico, that
can ruin water. Last year, my next
door neighbor spent the evening in
the hospital with slight food poison-
ing after eating the scallops. Yum!
We all heard about the slug-in-the-
salad caper last year, but that
happens all the time. Ice? No way,
that’s as rare as good food in our fair
cafeteria. Last year after Christmas
break, half of my floor went down to
dinner (the first day back). We all
got milk to go with our meal. The
milk had obviously been left in the
machine over vacation, three fun-
filled weeks of germ warfare. One of
my ball mates chugged a glass before
realizing that it was unbelievably
spoiled and spent the rest of the
evening in a cold sweat with a
temperature of 103 degrees. Is our
cafeteria taking kickbacks from
local restaurants to purposely serve
rotten food?

Housing — Living on a non-
elevator ﬂoor in the Towers means
that every time you want to go any-
where other than the bathroom, you
have to walk up or down I3 stairs.
On weekends, usually all the eleva-
tors except one are shut down, con-
serving energy, while everyone and
his brother use the elevators on
weekends. Windows? Open? In the
Towers? Come on, kids. What do

_you want, air? Go ahead, open them,
that will cost you. And how about
entrance to the dorms. You need 7
forms of ID and your birth certifi-
cate just to prove you really are alive
and your little brother as collateral
just to make sure you live there and
aren’t going to take anything. The
alcohol policy is in effect in the

dorms but not in the fraternity

Other fun stuff —— How about all
those pictures of the Cathedral you
see. It looks like the showroom for
General Electric with all the lighting.
Walk in there and you need a flash-
light just so you don’t.bump into
walls or other people. It’s as dark as
the gallows injolly old England. The
bus lane has been a big issue this
year. Good old Mr. Posvar says
build a walkway. Wesley, check the
one on Forbes. Count how many
people use it as compared to those
who cross the street. Go ahead and
fine them, that’s one possible solu-
tion, maybe then Pitt could buy the
football players some real cars
instead of the weak Camaros and
LTDs they drive now. Or maybe we
could hire a real football coach,
there’s a thought. No, this is Pitt,
we're content with a 2-7-1 record,
who wouldn’t be? I could see the
police trying to stop 700 students
crossing the street after one of their
overly exciting classes in David
Lawrence to give them citations. Of
Pitt’s freshmen, only 13 can sup-
posedly read and write on the college
level. So Pitt spends thousands in
preparation for the celebration of
the 200th graduating class when the
201st may not even graduate. How
about fire exits? The exits in the
Cathedral from the basement are
blocked off from the outside by gar-
bage cans and the ones from the
Towers cafeteria are blocked with a
lot of garbage. A

I know I’ve run at the mouth for a
while, but after all this is The Pitt
News, and that’s pretty typical of
this publication anyway. Other
schools in this country are trying
something that so far works and has
been pretty successful, it’s called
cooperation. They care about the
student and what happens to him
instead of the Pitt feeling of “when's
the check coming” or “hey, you
broke that light, that will cost you
$87.50 for damage, labor and lunch
for the guy who replaced it.” Come

on people, life outside these walls is a ‘

lot better than here. Let's try to
equal them out a little, huh? Give in
a bit, Pitt. If not, you’ll lose people
faster than your losing them now.
Oh, by the way, did you hear the one
about the Pitt student who trans-
ferred to West Virginia and raised
the IQs of both schools?

Deport Me

Penn State University criminally
used a mental institution to cover up
for administrators who were pro-
moting drug and alcohol abuse. For
several years, numerous state
government officials promised an
investigation into drug abuse at the
campus, but no investigation
occurred. When the attorney gener-
al’s office finally investigated, they
lied and covered up the matter.

Penn State has manufactured
bogus investigations to cover up
drug abuse. I filed suit in federal
court requesting the court to order
Penn State to release these bogus
investigations and other records
concerning drug abuse, and request-
mg an opportunity to subpoena
former students to testify about drug
abuse at Penn State. The court has
refused to hear my case and for five-
and-one-half years Penn State has
used its political power and money
to coerce and bribe government offi-
cials to cover up drug abuse at the
university.

I have renounced my American
citizenship as I no longer want to live
in a country where thejustice system
is a farce. l have requested the court
to order the government to deport
me, but Federal Jude-i Conabov has

Vito Valvano
Nicaragua’s
Tragedy

The following event occurred the
day after I left Nicaragua in a town
near where I stayed and was
reported by Americans I met there.

At about 2 p.m. on Saturday
afternoon, Sept. 1, three rocket-
firing planes and a helicopter
attacked the military training school
in Santa Clara, Hueva Segovia pro-
vince. It was visiting day for families
and 50 children were there. The
attack killed three Nicaraguan girls
and one 28-year-old civilian. No
Nicaraguan army soldiers died and
physical damage was minimal. Two
Amerian soldiers of fortune from
Alabama died when their American
helicopter was shot down. .

Two members of the Menonite
Church from Pittsburgh took part in.
the funeral and helped to bury the
three children, who were Juanita
Beltran, Elena Herrera and Alba
Luz Hernandez. Juanita and Elena,
both 12 years old, were selling fruit
juice and bake goods in "front of the
school; Alba_ Luz, 13, had climbed a
jacote tree to pick fruit.

A MK-40 rocket hit Juanita
directly and blew her to pieces, so
totally that a small box held all that
could be found for burial. “They had
to scoop her up with a shovel,” her
father mourned. Alba Luz was hit by
shrapnel, fell from the tree and was
carried to a building where she died
minutes later.

The planes and helicopter came
from the Jamastran airbase, one of
eight recently constructed by the
U.S. just outside the town of Donli,
Honduras, where I had talked with
Contra families in August. Only a
single range of hills separates Donli
from Santa Clara, perhaps 20 miles
away. Honduras and Nicaragua are
not at war. The U.S. has not
declared war, but somewhere
around 4,000 Nicaraguans have
been killed by the ClA—trained and
armed Contras. Most of those killed
have been civilians, men, women
and children like those killed in
Santa Clara.

Does the United States really need
the help of mercenaries recruited by
Soldier of Fortune magazine and the
Civilian Military Assistance Pro-
gram (CMA)? Does) this really
enhance our standing among the
community of nations? Do we really
wish to see young men from this
country sent there to die and notjust
to play war games and take part in
training maneuvers, such as Big Pine
II?

Nicaragua, it should be remem-
bered, has a population only twice
that of Allegheny County — and is
incomparably poorer.

From Where I Stand/

By Jim Hohman

Students, Unite!

The holidays are over. lt’s back to
the old grind. After the first week of
class, most everyone is more or less
readjusted to university life.

lt’s too soon in the year to talk
about this term, so let’s review the
previous one. How much did you
spend for the classes you took? Let’s
say the average tuition is around
$1200. Going to school,l5iweeks
that term means that you spent
approximately $80 each week on
classes.’Or to make it even more
meaningful, you spend 15 hours
each week in lecture/recitation (on
the average) and pay a little over $5
for each lecture hour. Five. Imagine,
that would be like handing your
professor a $5 bill at the end of each
clas_s for his lecture (you and 39
other people, again on the average).
Now ask yourself this question: Was

H he worth it?

Just think. That professor made
over $200 by being in class that day.
Was he organized? Did you learn
anything? Did he simply read the
book to you? Did you get your $5
worth?

That little economic example is
meant to show you what a crime
poor teachers are getting away with
at Pitt. And there are a lot of them.

Unfortunately, the attitude
among both the administration and
the students seems to be “Oh well,
it’s par for the course.” From a
student’s point of view, why
shouldn't we feel that way? We
students have no say over whether a
teacher should stay or go. But is that
right? In certain cases, of course.
There are good teachers who are
also unpopular with the students.
But then again, aren’t we the ones
who provide a good bit ofthe money
on which this university runs? If a
teacher is bad, why shouldn’t we be
‘able to generate some action? We
know better than anyone else the
quality of his N teaching.
Unfortunately, Pitt's system of
student evaluation of teaching_is set
against such ideas.

First and foremost, most teachers
(with exceptions such as grad
students) are not even required to
request such an evaluation and then,
if they do not like the results, do not
have to have the evaluation
published. So what do the students
usually get to see when the results of
the evaluations are printed? They see
pages of classes where the teacher
was rated “good.” And to add to the

‘ stories

irony, aren’t the majority of the
teachers you've had _ who've
requested evaluations the best
teachers you’ve had?

Also, the results of a teaching
evaluation have no weight in the
department’s consideration of the
professor in question. If he’s fired it‘s
because the department wanted him
fired, not the professor's students.
And, how many good professors

have been fired in spite of pleas from ~

students to keep them on? I know of
one such case in the computer
science department.

Dr. Buddemier was, in the words
of one of my friends, “a hard
teacher, but I learned so much off
her.” When the university did not
“take her back" (re:fired), a group of
students signed a petition asking to
retain Dr.Buddemier. She was not
retained. In the meantime, computer
science majors suffer under the
thumbs of men who do not belong in
a classroom. In one class I had last
term, the professor simply read from
lecture notes that he made available
in the library - no additions, merely
word-for-word readings off an
overhead projector. Another
professor mumbled his words or
spoke so fast no one could
understand him. Still another CS
professor spent 30 minutes on a
detailed proof that left most of his
students in a fog. After boggling the
entire class, he announced that this
kind of work was not going to be
presented again in class. He further
stated that he did not expect us to
understand it.

And l’ve heard similar horror
from friends in other
departments. Why do we put up
with this? Don’t we have any right to
dismiss a teacher of poor quality or
save ajob ofa good teacher? In 1983
there was some talk of updating the
teaching evaluation process and
giving more thought to student
input during SGB elections. I think
it is time to bring the subject up
again. It angers me to feel like I
wasted an hour by going to class,
and it should anger you, too. Write a
letter to the SGB, talk to the
department head when you feel that
a teacher isn’t earning his $5, let a
teacher know (in diplomatic terms)
what he could do better (maybe
compliment him on what he does
well first). If the man is at all
committed to education, he will
appreciate it. And you’ll be doing
yourself a favor.

As surely as a

m e e k answer

t u r n e t h away wrath does a sense
of humor deﬂate tantrums.

The Pitt News Has a Problem: N

The problem is one which has plagued’
mankind for centuries. We have what hal-
lowed philosophers throughout the ages
have called “very much space to fill, and
very little with which to fill it.” Recent
studies conducted at Upper Volta U. have
revealed that columns could fill the space.
If you would like to be a part of the paid
proof of this theory, submit your columns

Up Gallery -

By Niccol R. Donnelly
The Pitt News

l recently took advantage of a
little—known cultural center in Oak-
land. I went to an art display at the
UP Gallery. I wonder how many stu-
dents are aware of these exhibits.

.._ .r. .
o ,*_

i

Probably not many; most students
don’t even know where it's located.
The UP Gallery is on the corner of
Forbes and South Bouquet. (No, it
is not the cultural spot we know well
as the “O,” rather, a free art gallery
across the street.) Ruth Weisberg’s
“Works on Paper”is being displayed
there now through Feb. 3.

Ruth Weisberg is a noted artist,

“Second Child” by Ruth Weisberg

 

Dan Mottsmari/The Pitt News

critic, reviewer, arts advocate and
educator at USC and in the Los
Angeles area. She is acclaimed in the
field of“Dream Dramas,” including
revelations of the selfand the ability
to create a point where dreams and
realities meet. This theme is depicted
in a shadowy series of black and
white lithographs and drawings of
stop-time scenes involving the repe-
tition of a few main characters.
These characters are involved in acts
that appear to be part fantasy and
part reality. Her work emits a femi-
nist feeling toward male—female rela-
tionships represented by male
nudity when females are clothed.
These somewhat unusual works are
distinguished by a partially nude
woman wrapped in a sheet she is
holding closed. In these scenes we
also see barricades and ropes that
the woman might have once been
bound by, or perhaps they are dra-
matic attempts by the artist to create
an erotic illusion. Another theme
includes a dance teacher and reflec-
tions of her class. Other than the
theme series, there are a variety of
Weisberg’s works on paper.

This exhibit is a bold presentation
of Ruth Weisberg’s dream fantasies.
It has been well-received by the artis-
tic circles ‘and the general public. If
you are looking for bright colors or
placid landscapes, you may wish to
forego this exhibit for the next show.
But if you are intrigued by new
attempts at fantasy and the self, it
will excite your imagination. The
U P Gallery is open Tuesday through
Saturday from 11-4 p.m. and Sun-
days 2-5 p.m. Later exhibits will
include sculptures by Jim Morris in
February, Pittsburgh landscapes in
March and a finale ofstudent works.

More High Tech

Opportunities

Twenty-one high technology
companies from the Pittsburgh
area will recruit Pitt students for
high technology jobs when these
firms participate in a Job Fair/
/ Recruitment program on cam-
pus Jan. l7.

Companies scheduled to
appear at Pitt represent such
high tech industries as robotics,
software development, artificial
intelligence, process control sys-
tems, measurement devices and
liquid crystal display screens.

Sponsored by the Pittsburgh
High Technology Council and
the University of Pittsburgh
Placement Service, the Job Fair
is designed to assist the compan-
ies in their short- and long-term
recruiting efforts and help the
students make contacts and
explore opportunities to work
for local high tech companies.

This is the second year that the
Council has conducted the Job
Fair. A similar event will be held
for students of Carnegie-Mellon

University on Feb. 27. In 1984,
the Job Fairs attracted more
than 1,200 students, receiving
high marks from both job seek-
ers and recruiters. Companies

“We're sick and tired of being sick
and tired!" is the motto forthe Black
Women's Health Network, a branch
of the Health Education Center. The
group met on Saturday morning to
discuss the “Health Survival Needs
of the Black Community.“

The Black Women’s Health Net-
work, founded by Cora Raiford and
chaired by Dr. Judith Davenport, is
a national organization which
focuses on the special health needs
of the black female. The network
spends most of it's time and energy
trying to prevent such problems as
the high infant mortality rate, teen-
age pregnancies and what keynote
speaker Dr. Kenneth Goodrich said
is the most common cause of death
for blacks: heart disease.

In addition, the network hopes to
educate black women on such health
problems as lupus, stress and dia-
betes. They also hope to initiate
child-watch programs.

The Black Women's Health Net-
work is funded by such organiza-
tions as the Junior League of
Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh
Graduate School of Public Health
and the Urban League of Pitts-
burgh. The Health Education Cen-
ter sponsors a number of other
programs such as Tel-Aid and the
Healthy Pregnancy Program.

PITTSBURGH (UPI) — More
bad news for Pittsburgh motorists.
PennDOT officials have announced
plans to rebuild part of the Parkway
East. PennDOT said that in four to
six weeks five downtown Parkway

. East ramps will be closed. By April

I, the westbound lanes between

5 Oakland and downtown Pittsburgh

will be closed and traffic will be
shifted to the eastbound lanes.

(UPI) - An attorney has said that
David Crosby will undc rgo therapy
at a New Jersey hospi.al. Crosby
was ordered arrested because he
failed to enter a drug treatment
program.

Dallas lawyer Thomas Glenn said
Thursday that Crosby went from his
Marin County, California, home to
Fair Oaks hospital in Summit, New
Jersey, to enter a drug treatment
program.

Glenn said after Crosby enters the
drug treatment program, state dis-
trict judge Pat McDowell will with-
draw a warrant for Crosby’s arrest.
The . judge Wednesday revoked
Crosby's $15,000 bond and ordered
his arrest after lawyers told him
Crosby had not entered a drug reha-
bilitation program.

Crosby was sentenced to five
years in prison last August when he
was convicted of possessing cocaine
and carrying a loaded .45-caliber
pistol in the dressing room of a Dal-
las nightclub where he was
performing.

BONN, West Germany (UPI) —
An unarmed U.S. Pershing missile
being used in a training exercise
accidentally ignited at a base in West
Germany on Friday.

An intense blast of heat killed two
Gls on the spot, and two others died
before they reached a hospital. _At
least 10 soldiers were injured.

The army wouldn‘t say ifthe mis-
sile was an older Pershing-l or a

, modern Pershing-2, first developed

in West Germany by NATO 13
months ago. The Pershing-2 is a
two-stage, solid fuel ballistic missile
capable of hitting Soviet targets with
a single warhead within 10 minutes.

The army unit involved in the
accident ~— based near Heilbrown,
30 miles from Stuttgart — is
equipped with both Pershing-l and
Pershing-2 missiles.

(UPI) —— President Reagan is
spending the weekend at Camp
David, Md., polishing his inaugural
speech. Don’t look for any legisla-
tive proposals in his speech. It will be
what Reagan's aids call “thematic.”
The White House said Reagan will
(wear a business suit, not the formal

morning coat he wore at his 1981 ‘

inauguration. An aide said the infor-
mal look is more in keeping with the
“We the People” theme.

(UPI) — A private transportation
group said some states may scrap the
55 mph speed limit this year. The
Highway Users Federation said the
move would follow a study that said
the limit may not be needed on some
rural roads. In I974, Congress called
for the limit because of the Arabpoil
embargo which led to a gasoline
shortage. The penalty for states not
complying with the limit is loss of
some highway funds.

NICARAGUA (UPI) -— An
American nun kidnapped by Nica-
raguan rebels last week and later
released said she’s saddened to think
it’s her government that's helped
fund her kidnappers. Maryknoll
nun Nancy Donovan said the rebels
were trained to kill and terrorize
civilians.

PITTSBURGH (UPI) -- Doctors
at Pittsburgh's Allegheny General
Hospital said they will test a drug

The Pitt News, Monday, January 14, 1985

that may reverse the effects ofspinal
cord injuries. Testing of the drug
Naloxone will begin at the end of the
month.

(UPI) — A group representing
most U.S. aspirin makers has agreed

to develop warning labels about.

Reye’s Syndrome. There is a possi-
ble link between the disease and
aspirin. The disease affects children
and teenagers, usually after they
have had the flu or chicken pox, and
is often fatal.

PITTSBURGH (UPl)—Author-
ities said that more than 20 people
had to be evacuated when a six-
alarm fire swept through a Pitts-
burgh rowhouse early Friday.

Officials said the fire in the 3,500-
block of the Boulevard of the Allies
was of a suspicious nature. Officials
said they found gasoline and other
suspicious items at the scene.

Two firefighters were slightly
injured fighting the blaze, which
took an hour and a half to bring
under control. The blaze caused
about $150,000 in damage.

The residents were evacuated first

to a Port Authority of Allegheny
County bus and then taken to a Red
Cross Shelter.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (UPI)
— An investigation is underway into
a gas leak at a chemical plant last
Friday.

A cloud ofsulfuric acid gas spread
over the town of Karlskoga, 200
miles west of Stockholm, forcing the
evacuation of 300 people until
morning winds swept the gas away.

Twenty people were treated with
injections of cortisone and doses of

Shuten Finds Pot of Gold At Trees Pool

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

As is the case with all athletes, the
road to the top is not all fun and
games, and the percentage of those
who actually do make it is minimal
indeed. Perhaps no one realizes this
more than sophomore diver Jack
Shuten.

Since transferring to Pitt from
North Carolina-Wilmington last
year, Shuten has had to travel the
long road toward success. Said div-
ing coach Julian Krug, “Jack was a
good age group diver. Before com-
ing to Pitt, he had developed an out-
standing rip entry technique on his
basic dives. However, he needed
serious work on his strength and
boardwork and had extreme diffi-
culty with his optional dives.”

After arriving at Pitt, though,

Shuten added 10 to 15 pounds of
muscle — enabling him to become
more consistent on the board. In the
process, he has learned a one-meter
list in which five of his six optional
dives have the highest degree ofdiffi-
culty possible.

Shuten explained, “Coming to
Pitt and working with Julian made
me discover the natural talent which
I never thought I had. He isthe main
reason for me transferring."

Shuten started out with his inter-
ests mainly centered around swim-
ming and gymnastics, but was taken
into a private diving club his fresh-
man year in high school, and it’s
been practice ever since.

“I was always attracted to the div-
ing board,” Shuten said. “In seventh
grade I had the opportunity to work
with the high school team and by
eighth grade I was competing.”
Jack‘s biggest thrill: “Being elected a

high school honorable mention All-
America in Rochester, New York.”

However, high school diving and
competing at the NCAA level are
two different things and nobody
knows this more than Krug. “Jack’s
training time and improved board
technique have made him one of the
strongest divers around,” he said.
“He wants to be the best. His confi-
dence alone makes him believe he
can be the best. I'm very proud of his
progress in the one-and-a-half years
he’s been here."

His performance so far has
proven his talent. He has done the
best ofthe Pitt divers in his first meet

Not close this time for

By Michael Beitonaschi
For The Pitt News

After playing in a succession of
tight games, the Pitt women’s bas-

ketball team (8-6) finally got a,

reprieve when it blew out the Seton
Hall Bucettes at South Orange, N.J.,
Saturday 76-58.

Dating back to Dec. 15, the
Panthers’ final scores were enough
to make even the strongest hearts
flutter. The string of close games
began on that day and continued

ever as a Panther, taking the three-
meter competition at the Penn State
triple—dual meet late last year; this
indicates a commendable effort,
considering the strength and talent
of the Penn State and Pitt squads.

Krug is definitely pleased with
Shuten’s efforts. “This season Jack
has established himself as our No.I
diver, an extreme compliment, con-
sidering the quality of this team,”
stated Drug.

In high school, Shuten thought of
himself as very superstitious, some-
times eating the same breakfast and
lunch and wearing the same trunks
before a given meet. Shuten says

through the holiday season, culmi-
nating in last week’s one-point loss
to Villanova. Discounting Satur-
day’s blowout and a 20-point loss at
Detroit in December, Pitt‘s last six
games were all too close for comfort.
During that stretch, the Panthers
won three games and lost three. The
three victories were by a combined
total of eight points while the defeats
were by a total of five points. One of
the losses was decided in overtime
while another required two over-
times to declare a victor.
Considering all ofthis, Saturday’s

It was billed as a battle between
Mario Lemieux and Wayne
Gretzky, and as the 16,033 fans that
witnessed it will attest, it was no dis-
appointment. The Pittsburgh Pen-
guins pulled out all the stops
Saturday night at the Civic Arena as
Lemieux and Troy Loney scored
two goals apiece to lead the Pen-
guins over the Edmonton Oilers 4-3.

Lemieux was a crowd pleaser as
he opened the scoring and got the
Pens the lead, I-0 early in the first
period, then added the potential
game winner at 7:30 in the third
period. Both goals came off assists
from Wayne Babych and Warren
Young.

Gretzky did not score, but he
made more passes than Burt Rey-
nolds on a Friday night, and ulti-
mately assisted on all three Oiler
goals.

The Pens are currently I7-I9-4
and are in fourth place in the Patrick
Division. They trail the third place
New York Islanders by ll points.

Around the city over the weekend,
two of Pitt’s basketball rivals took
the same route the Panthers did.

In football news, Pittsburgh
Steeler running back Rich Erenberg
had reconstructive surgery done on
his nose for the second time in as
many weeks. Erenberg originally
had surgery the day after the Steeler-
Denver playoff game, but the nose
could not withstand the abuse Eren-
berg took in practice and in the
Miami Dolphin game, and had to be
redone last week.

The Steelers‘ main concern right
now is preparations for the NFL
draft. The Steelers are expected to
look to add depth in the offensive
line and in the defensive backfield.

One event that will occur before
the NFL draft is the opening of
spring training for the major
leagues. The Pirates have added sev-
eral key players that will help a great
deal, including George Hendrick,
Steve Kemp and Tim Foli. It will be
a new look for the Bucs when they
take on the defending Eastern Div-
ision champion Chicago Cubs on
April 9 at Wrigley Field to open the
I985 season. The Pirate home
opener is April I2 at 6:05 p.m.
against the St. Louis Cardinals.

Now Ijust try to be nice to everyone
before a meet - ifyou can call that a

Because of the close-knit team
and Krug’s coaching, Shuten
believes the NCAAs and All-
America status are goals to strive
for. Krug forecasts a shorter time
period, however. “Because ofJack's
lack of exposure and the fact he's
never tried for the NCAAs before, it
would be highly unusual, but I
believe Jack Shuten could become
an All-America this year,“ Krug
remarked.

game was a much-needed breather
and confidence-builder for Pitt. The
game was never in much doubt from
the opening tap. Pitt used superior
heightand quicknesstotake an early
lead and built a 40-2l margin at the
intermission. Seton Hall defeated
Pitt twice last year, knocking them
out ofthe Big East playoffs, but was
decimated by graduation, losing
four starters. The Bucettes were
further hurt by an injury to fresh-
man center Cheryl Greybush, who
was on the bench in street clothes
with a knee injury. With Greybush
out of the lineup, the Seton Hall
inside game was rendered useless,
and with guards Lisa Fubio and Kim
Tirik harassing the Bucette pair of
Cathey O’Reilly and Carol Allman
into making bad passes and shots,
the Lady Panthers were in blowout
city.

Both Tirik and Fubio had been
struggling as oflate, shooting a com-
bined four for I7 from the field and
handing out only four assists
between them in the one-point loss
to Villanova. The two turned things
around on Saturday. Tirik finished
with 10 points on five for six shoot-
ing, four assists and four steals;
Fubio also shot with confidence,
and finished with 13 points, four
assists and four steals. The two
guards also played tireless defense
which played a big part in the
Bucettes‘ 23 turnovers for the game.
Jenny Tyner, Pitt’s 6-5 center,
chipped in I4 points and blocked
four shots.

One player who has not had to
struggle this year, or any of her four
years at Pitt, is leading scorer Jen-
nifer Bruce. She finished the first
‘ialf with 15 points, tying her with
Debbie Lewis, who was the all-time
leading scorer in Panther history.
Two minutes into the second half
Bruce took a pass on the baseline,
and using her patent spin move, put
in a layup which broke the record.
She finished the game with 25 points
and needs only 50 points to pass
Clyde Vaughn to become the all-
time leading scorer in both men's
and women’s basketball at Pitt.

Pay your respects as you go by? A

the practices would be well in order
for Providence, a team ‘ready to per-

fanatical spirit has been that lacking.

injured and that put a damper on
our relay team for the entire season. ”

Next up for the team is the presti-
gious Kodak lnvitational in John-
son City, Tenn. next Saturday.
“There are a lot of big schools at this
meet, but I have to see what some of
our people can do,” said the coach.
Kennedy added that Henderson
would run the 55-meters but sit out
all other events.

There are no funny or diabolical
signs printed and waved. Students
wouldn’t know a chant‘from the
definition of thermodynamics. The
Pitt band — despite past comments
in this space —- performs admirably,
but fan cooperation is worse than
that found in U.S.-Soviet arms
talks. Putting it squarely, everyone’s
a square when it comes to Pitt bas-

Everyone, that is, except for some
die-hard enthusiasts who were

better clean up their act. Before con-

John Madden, “Wait a minute ...!"

Hockey Club tars Tartans

‘ By Mary Wolf

The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club
upped their already impressive
record to 8-2-1 Saturday with a 5-1
victory over CMU. The Tartans
made the Panthers sweat a little for
this win, denying them a goal until
the second period.

“It wasn’t that we weren't playing
well,” said right wing Roger
Oldaker. “CMU played good. They
played at our level._ Their defense
played really well.”

Early in the second period a CMU
skater was the first to score but the
Panthers followed close behind with
goals from Jeff Bell and Oldaker in
that same period. The Panthers held
on to the lead, adding three more
goals before the end of the game
while goalie John Godwin blocked
any additional scoring attempts
from CMU.

According to defenseman John
Pettit, the Panthers started out a lit-
tle slow. “We were a little flat at the
beginning‘ of the game,” said Pettit.
“It could have been higher scoring.
We can’t come out like that for Gan-
non or we’re going to get beat.” Gan-
non handed the Panthers their first

loss earlier this season and the skat- _

ers are hoping to gain their revenge
in a rematch set for Saturday.

The Panthers first will take to the
road to skate with Wheeling in a
game scheduled for l0:30 Wednes-

day night. The last time the Pitts-
burgh Hockey Club challenged
Wheeling, they came up with an
overwhelming 23-1 victory and the
Panthers expect much of the same
kind of action this time.

“For Wheeling‘s sake, I hope
they've improved," commented Pet-
tit. “I think we’ll dojust as good this
time."

Wheeling may pose more of a
threat than the Panthers expect. The
Pitt skaters may have no trouble
beating Wheeling, but ifthey do, this
game won’t do much to prepare the
Panthers for the tougher weekend
play.

“We’re looking forward to the big
weekend set with Gannon and
Slippery Rock,” said defenseman
Bill Kicinski. “I hope we’re not look-

ing too far ahead. When you play a’

team like Wheeling, you start getting
into some bad habits and those hab-

‘its tend to carry over. That's what

scares me most about a team like
that. ljust hope we can play a good,
solid game against Wheeling so we’ll
be ready for the weekend."

TOKYO, Japan (UPI) »— Quar-
terback Gil Gilbert threw for a pair
of touchdown passes to lead the
West to a 28-14 win over the East in
the lOth Annual Ricoh Japan Bowl
near Tokyo. The University of Cali-
fornia product twice stepped in for
Randall Cunningham, who was
plagued by interceptions.

made her contribution to the win by
assisting in the 400-meter freestyle
victory and by placing ‘second in the
500-meter freestyle. It was that kind
of contribution, according to Belo-
wich, that inspired the team during
the meet.

"I’ve been swimming really con-
sistently. That’s helped me develop
as we’ve fallen together as a team,”
Cassidy said.

Another inspirational moment in
the meet was diver Tricia Ney’s emo-
tional victory over All-America
Mary Ellen Clark from Penn State.

“It felt so good. It was a dream
come true for me,” Ney said of the
event. “I thought it would be close. I
really wanted‘ to win to get the team
points. I think we all did good
overall.”

“I think that the divers influenced
the swimmers and that the
swimmers influenced the divers in
this meet,” Belowich said. “Every-
one was really prepared for this type
of close competition.”

Olympian Sue Heon had a fantas-
tic day, taking first place in three
events: the 1,000-meter freestyle, the
500-meter freestyle and the 200-
meter backstroke. .

“I was a little nervous going into
the 200 backstroke,” she said. “I
didn’t let the fact that the race was
close affect me while I was swim-
ming. I was able to pace myself to
pull ahead for the last 100 yards.”

Other swimmers taking first place
in the meet were sophomore Jodi
O’Neil in the I00-meter and 200-
meter breast stroke, Judy Haughton
in the 200-meter butterfly and Susan
Hickman in both the 50-meter and
I00-meter freestyle.

The 5-0 record has the team set-
ting their sights on an undefeated
season. “Winning this meet was a
key factor in going 9-0," Haughton
said. “It brings us past the halfway
mark.”

“We want four more wins. We
swam so well here we have to keep
going,” Cassidy added.

The team will travel to Clarion
State Jan. I9. The next several meets
will provide more individual compe-
tition than the kind ofteam competi-
tion they had with Penn State.
Clarion State has been Division II
national champions for the last few
years, but they have a few holes in
their lineup due to the graduation of
some key people.

St. John’s.”

Now that he’s been vilified,
Carnesecca leads a team playing
with a vengeance that some have
already said may take it to the
Final Four. Mullin (16.6), Berry
(15.3) and Wennington (l2.3)
lead in scoring, leaving to ques-
tion how the Redmen lost to Nia-
gara and why Mullin’s scoring
touch wavered before hitting for
20 against Villanova a week ago.

“He was just missing some
shots,” Mahoney reasoned,
though weakly. “The papers
seem to build it up in a strong
way. He’s fine. They blew it out

Huskies sli

of proportion. It proved he's
human. When Lou had Rick
Barry in the pros, he had games
where he’d be four-for-16. Chris
has proved for over three years
he’s an outstanding shot."
None of which is lost on Chip-
man. “Like anybody else, he was
in a bit of a shooting slump,” he
said last week. “The thing about
Chris Mullin, he's such a good
player, he doesn’t have to score
to be a good player. Chris is as
good a player as any, but he’s
caught in a situation where he
doesn't know whether to pass or

keep it. He has to make adj’u'sti? I 

ments on the ballclub to keep

p past Pitt

everyone happy. With a guy like
[Walter] Berry up front, he has to
have the ball.”

“I would think, of his shot
selection, Chris is averaging like
he did last year at this time,”
Mahoney countered. “They’re all
getting a piece of the action.”

St. John’s has also been get-
ting 33.5 rebounds per game.
a Combined with the Redmen’s
six-game winning streak, includ-
ing wins over UCLA and North
Carolina State, asking for a third
_annual victory equals the task of
shooting arrows through a tropi-
cal gale.

respectively, in the three-mile run;
and Jesse Mikell, who finished third
in the 600-yard run. Among the rest
of the squad, Mickey Rihtarchik fin-
ished -fifth in the 1,000-yard dash;

Alan Laws ran to a third-place.finish
in the 880; Bob Weiner and Joe
Daniels finished second and fifth in
the mile-run, respectively; and
Darren Rogers garnered fifth place
in the 50-yard hurdles. The Panther

mile relay team of Rogers Thomas,
Dorrell Hilliman, Calvin Holmes
and Jesse Mikell ran to a second-
place finish.

Overall, Vasvary said that he was
pleased with the way the Panthers
had been progressing this season but
added that he is not really surprised
with the strong performances of any
one member of the squad or in the
squad as a whole. “Everyone is run-
ning the way we expected them to

when we came into the season.” Vas-
vary added that the one area that the
Panthers must improve in is that of
consistency. He said, ‘‘I’m very
pleased with the way we have been
running, but we must improve on
our consistency; that is to say, that
one week someone will run rather
well, while that next week that same
runner will not run as well.” The
next meet for the Panthers willebe
the Kodak Invitational this
weekend.

The Lady Panthers gymnastics
team traveled across the state this
weekend to meet the Temple Lady
Owls and came away with a 172.9-
l7l.55 victory.

Head coach Donna Sanft said
after the squad’s first meet of the
new semester, “I thought we did
pretty good. We started slow, losing
the first event, _but we did well after
that and won the meet.”

Sanft also said she felt a perfor-
mance on the balance beam by Kim
Calderone “was the highlight of the
whole meet for us. Her performance

was awarded a 9.4 for the routine.
Other team highlights included
freshman Lisa Monahan’s 8.75 in
vaulting and Kristy Pieters’ score of
9.1 in the ﬂoor routine. That event
was more difficult than usual for the

ﬂoor Surface than Pitt’s gym Debbie Dabkowski (right) and Jorge Sanchez

Sports Monday

January 14, 1985

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

In overall fortitude or ll
games, whichever is preferred,
the Big East leader board posi-
tioned the Panthers in a site most
foreign to them: the third slot in
rebounding marg-in (+5.3).

That, of course, appeared
prior to Connecticut's 76-74
glazing Saturday night, a win
that: 1) temporarily extended
Huskies coach Dom Perno’s job
after a four-game losing stretch;
2) had Coach Roy Chipman
wondering why his boys stood
around in the second half as if on
a street corner; and 3) makes one
wonder what it’s like playing St.

John’s at home with a 2-0 record
in the conference.

The Panthers (9-3, 1-1) will
attempt to make it three straight
Fitzgerald Field House wins in a
row tonight when they entertain
the ll-l, 3-0 Redmen. By.8 p.m.
tipoff, it is anticipated that the
team’s ticket for a loitering viola-
tion on Saturday evening will
have been paid in full. Part ofthe
citation read 29-24 rebounding
average, Huskies, and a woeful
l2 of 20 free throws for Pitt.

“I thought, really, all our
problems started at the seventh
or eighth minute of the first
half,” Chipman said on his radio
show after Pitt saw its 15-point
lead melt. “We got a great start
and then Charles Smith got his
third foul and we had to take him

out. Connecticut dominated
from there on. We're bulkier
than they are, and l wasjust dis-
appointed that we did not
rebound the ball at all.”

Though Smith led all scorers
with 22 points, ahead of Curtis
Aiken’s l7, his three rebounds
paled compared to his team-
leading 7.3.

“They were quicker to the ball
than we were,” Chipman admit-
ted later. “We weren't going after
it. We were doing a lot of stand-
ing, and it looked like, you know,
everybody thought someone else

was going to get it. There’s just v

no way we shouldn’t have
rebounded better tonight.
[UConn] is not one of the better
rebounding teams in the league
and yet they out-rebounded us.”

Chipman further explained: “I
don’t think we made three or
four fast breaks in the second
half, and I bet we had 15 in the
first half. We stopped running
when the game got on the line. It
comes from being afraid of doing
that little bit extra.”

Whether the illness Clears by
this evening could determine the
outcome, the last two coming by
one- and two-point margins.
Usually irrepressible, St. John's
coach Lou Carnesecca enters
with a lineup loaded with Chris
Mullin, Bill Wennington and
newly-acquired Walter Berry
(8.5 rebounds, overall tied third
in the league).

A couple of recent events
might have tested Chief Red-
man, who is in his 17th year, but,

Panthers hounded by Huskies

sigh, all in vain. First there was
this writer with a penchant for
using anonymity to the hilt,
quoting enough Deep Throats in
a recent Inside Sports piece that
he conjured up alleged cheating,
rule-bending and iron-hand
Coaching practices by Carnesec-
ca.

Secondly, a flu attacked Loo-
ie's antibodies last Wednesday,
forcing bedroom isolation
through at least the early S
weekend.

In his place, assistant Brian
Mahoney set the mood Friday.
‘‘It‘s a false article, a real hatchet
job. lf anybody reads and if
anybody knows Looie’s been in
coaching 35 years, they know
what kind of program he has at

Swimmers
Top PSU

By Mary Dalgle
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s swimming and
diving team boosted their record to
5-0 Saturday in their 77-63 victory
over Penn State.

‘ The decision came down to the
fi al nt, he 400-meter freestyle
;2'la;.el‘i;z relay team, e3a§i§tia§ at
junior Alicia Dugan, freshmen
Cindy Rose and Marian Cassidy
and sophomore Susan Hickman,
needed to takethat event to avoid a
tie. Coach David Belowich said
before the meet that he thought that
the meet would be decided by the

final relay, but he was very confident ,

in that ‘relay team.

“If it came down to the last relay, I
knew that all four girls are great
sprinters, and I had a lot of confi-
dence in them taking that event.”

The rallying finish was not the
only factor in the victory, according
to Belowich. “The team really pulled
together. Everyone did a fantastic
job. Even the people who didn’t
score made lifetime-best times.
Everyone contributed, even the
crowd was fantastic," he said.

The Panthers were able to take
points in every event but the first -
the 200-meter medley relay. Accord-
ing to Belowich, this shows that the
team has “no holes” and is covered
in every event.

“We were able to [stop] Penn
State from taking too many first and
second places. That was the key,” he
said. “People came through down
the line. We have the depth to sur-
vive anything. There is always some-
one there if we need to pick up for
someone else.”

Adding *to the team's depth is
freshman Marian Cassidy. She

‘Lucky’ seven
for runners

in Carolina

By Rich McKenzie
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s
men's track and field team traveled
to North Carolina for the North
Carolina Invitational Track Meet

_ on Saturday and came home with a
victory. In a meet that is scored
based upon who has the most first-
place finishes, the Panthers regis-
tered seven for the victory. Their
closest competitor was North Caro-
lina State, who garnered four first-
place finishes, followed by host
North Carolina with three.

The 10 teams that were entered in
the meet ran on a l76-yard, board-
based track which Coach John Vas-
vary called a slow surface to run on.

The first-place finishes on the
Panthers’ side came from Lee
McRae, who set a new record with a
time of 6.0 in the 60-yard dash and a
time of 5.3 in the 50-yard dash; Ken
Picciano finished first with a time of
l,434.3 in the three-mile run; and
Tim Manes, with a 214.5 in the
1,000-yard run.

Other first-place finishes‘ came
from Rodney Giles in the 880-yard
run with a time of 156.0 and pole
vaulter Jim Johnson with a height of
14-6. The distance medley team of
Tim Manes, Alan Laws, Bob Weiner
and Rodney Giles also ran to a first-
place finish. Tim Manes received a
special award as the Outstanding
Distance Runner of the meet.

Other strong performances were
turned in by Panthers who did not
finish first in a particular event.
These included Calvin Holmes, who
finished second in both the 50- and
60-yard high hurdles with times of
6.2 and 7.4; Joel Ninos and Michael
Doll, who finished third and fourth,
