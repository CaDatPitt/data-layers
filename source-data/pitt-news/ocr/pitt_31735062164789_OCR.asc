Registration Turn-Out
Responsible for Early
Fill - Up Of Courses

A list released Wednesday
stating that 63 courses were
closed does- not mean that
the students registering this
trimester cannot enter these
courses in the fall.

Anthony Athens, assistant
registrar of student’ records,

~ explained that because of the

number of students who have al-
ready registered, certain courses
will be offered sparingly, ac-
cording to deﬁnite need.

Registrations are currently be-
ing processed on an alternating
basis between students who reg-
istered in the winter term and
those who are registering now.

In this way students who met
with their advisers_ on the ﬁrst
day of registration in March will
have their registrations processed
with students who registered on
the ﬁrst day of registration in
June. A similar procedure will
be followed with the other reg-
istrations.

 

e . REMINDER

ltegistration for the an term is
now in progress. Those students
who have not yet registered
should make appointments with
their advisers immediately. Un-
derclassmen should contact the
Liberal Arts Advising Center
for their appointments. Those
students with 60 or more cred-_
its completed by S, the. end of
this term should contact their
major adviser.

SG to Expand

Directory  

Work begins this month
on the 1965-1966 Student
Government Student Direc-
tory, which will list both full-
time undergraduates and
graduate students for’ the
ﬁrst time.

According to David Ur-
baitis, editor of the Direc-
tory, it will include supplement
in order to list ’ all late regis-
trants, transfer students, and in-
complete registrants, who pre-
viously were not listed.‘

 

All student organizations and
student related officers, suchtas
the advising and health centers
will also be listed. The Directory
should be reduced in cost this
year and distribution is sched-

uled for the ﬁrst week of October.

Urbaitis announced that lay-
out, design, publicity, sales, _busi-
ness, secretarial and proofread-
ing positions are open_.

All interested students are in-

Because approximately 600 stu-
dents registered during the ﬁrst
week of March, and a large num-
ber have already registered this
term, many of the small recita-
tion and laboratory courses are
ﬁlled. So far, though, only Intro-
duction to Social Science 85 and
Fine Arts 10 and 11 are closed,
said Athens. ‘ .

Temporary

Chancellor

Considered  

The University is consid-
ering appointing an acting
Chancellor to assume Chan-
duties
while he is recuperating
from his recent heart attack.

 ‘ The announce-
ment was made
r e c en tly by

A Gwily m A.
i Price, chairman
of the Board of

"Trustees.
 "It is quite
<' . ; true that, we
V DR. cannot get along

LITCI-[FIELD for very long
without an administrative head,”
he. said in explaining why the
move was being considered.

.“I think it’s possible that Dr.
Litchﬁeld may be back on the
job by Labor Day,” Price said.
“But in a health matter of this
kind it is always possible that
an -extended leave of absence
could be in the picture.”

Price said that no decision
would be made “for at least a
week, maybe a month.” ,

Chancellor Litchﬁeld. is aware
of the move under consideration
and is “mulling it over.” Any
move taken will be done with the
.Chancellor’s recommendation.

Shortly after Dr. Litchﬁeld’s
heart attack the University had
considered dividing his duties
among the various vice-chancel-
lors but is now reconsidering the
policy.

Council of Higher Education

Meets Following Aid Request -

Legislators Polled
Favor State Grant

By KAREN TOKAR and EMMTA THOMPSON
The University's request for $5,million
in state- appropriations received. varied com-
-ments from state legislators, but most of

the legislators were in favor of the bill.
State Senator Albert Pechan, a Uni-
versity trustee, commenting on the Uni-
versity’s need for ﬁve million dollars said that he
thinks “we're going to get it.” He remarked that
“we have to have it, it's a crisis and the state has
the funds and should come to the University’s

rescue.” ,
“We have a medical, dental, engineering and

' law school; we're a whole university. Now would

the Commonwealth be willing to spend the amount
of money necessary to keep this.going?”. concluded
the Senator." "

“I hope the University gets it,” stated Repre-
sentative Harry Markovitz, “and I’ll vote. for it
100 per cent . . . if Governor Scranton says OK,
the appropriation probably will go through, but
the committee is still investigating the possibil-
ities.” . -

Representative Markovitz did not feel that the
University would be required to become a state
school in order to receive the money. .“They’ll (the
University) get the _money. someway, but you can
never_ tell wh_at,.th,e.-state» might._..d_0. They might
declare’ an ultimatum stating “ﬁve million‘ and ‘go
state or no money,” he said.

“Either the University gets more state money

State To Examine

Financial Problems

The State Council of Higher Education
will convene at the University Wednesday
morning to make a ﬁrst hand examination
of financial difficulties at the University,
in the hopes of ﬁnding a solution.

The decision for the meeting was made

Wednesday after Pennsylvania Governor William '

W. Scranton appeared before the State Board of
Education to discuss the University’s ﬁnancial sit-
uation, describing it as “dire.” ‘

Charles G. Simpson, a Philadelphia industrial-
ist and chairman of the Council, said that the
Council intended to treat the situation as an emer-
gency. The University has asked the "state for an
immediate appropriation of $5 million. '‘

Simpson said that it was because of the emer-
gency that the Council ‘decided on so immediate
a trip. He. further stated that no decision will be
made on the University request until after the
visit. -
There has been considerable discussion .that
making the University a state school would solve
the present ﬁnancial crisis. Simpson, however, felt
that the University management is not in favor
of ‘this proposal.

Simpson said that in the course of its investi-
gation, the Council learned. that the University

had received large contributions from. private

donors in the past, but that these donors _are.SO
disgusted with present ﬁscal management at‘ the
University that they are unwilling to make fur-
ther contributions. ~

Editorial

_ 7 - Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s absence from the University
scene and the conditions surrounding it -have made him more
of a topic of discussion than when he was here. Because his
illness and consequent absence bear many of the earmarks
-iwofitthe usual method of easing out unwanted corporation
‘L_ executives, most talk (usually irresponsible) has centered
 on his “faults.”
o The Chancellor’s major “fault” is that he is responsible '
[infor the University’s ﬁnancial trouble because he spent too
3 freely. Such an argument is completely ridiculous! First of
 all, despite what many people believe, Dr. Litchﬁeld does not
  have a free hand in running the Univ.ersity—ﬁnancia1ly or
 otherwise. The Board of Trustees must approve every major

 

    
  
   
 

 spending recklessly or in excess, they could have stopped
 y him at will. It is unfortunate that people must find a scape-
.3 ., goat for everything, It is even more unfortunate that the
ff 5 Chancellor’s illness and absence makes him an easier target.

In the excitement of the hunt for a scapegoat, Chan

cellor Litchﬁeld’s critics overlooked and ignored his achieve-

I ments-. The strides which the University has made under

__ , his guidance and design are impressive. The quality of the‘
student body has increased to the point where 88 per cent
of last year’s entering class came from the top two-ﬁfths of
their high school class as opposed to 67 per cent of the 1955-
56 class. In the past ﬁve years the average board score has
risen from 982 to 1121.

. The increase in quality and quantity of faculty is equal-
 ly impressive. The number of full-time faculty members
has doubled since Dr. Litchﬁeld assumed the Chancellorship.
This increase has raised the student-faculty ratio fromg12-1
to 7.8-1. The percentage of faculty members who hold

earned doctorate degrees has risen from 40 to 84 per cent _

Another major change, one which many people have
M failed to accept as an improvement, is the trimester system.

Students Oppose
Towers’ Change .

Editor, The Pitt News:

Our attention has been direct-
ed' to the June 7 issue of The
Pitt News in which it was an-
nounced that freshmen women
students will be housed in Tow-
er C next term. We greet this
announcement with enthusiastic
approv.al. However, we should
like to offer a modest proposal
which would augument the an-
nouncement and which would re-
main consistent with present
dormitory -policy.

We agree that housing fresh-
men women in the same build-
ing with graduate men is a good
idea. It will undoubtedly help
alleviate the housing. shortage
and no complications need be
expected since graduate men are
not attracted by younger women.

But why stop here? We pro-

pose alternating rooms of men I

and women. The architectural
difficulty of installing shower
curtains ‘for the women should

not prove to be insurmountable. -

Furthermore, being residents
of Tower C, we can say with
conﬁdence that our purpose here
is not to enjoy the comfort and
convenience of the Towers, but
is to enrich and enlarge our re-
spective a c a d e mic disciplines
through continuous concentrated
study, "meditation and suffering.
For this reason we feel that
under this plan it would not in-
convenience graduate men to
share their single rooms with
two or three other graduate men.
Because of theincrease in the
academic atmosphere provided,
an appropriate increase in the
room rent will be necessary.
The Tower facilities for con-
vention delegates and itinerant
guests of the University should
be expanded: Lamps should be

i Imasro THE EDIT

purchased for their rooms, since
these people deserve the very
best we can oﬁer in the-< way of
luxury. '

We must still consider the up-
perclass women: they should re-
main in the quadrangle dormi-
tories. To suggest that they be
moved-to the Towers is unthink-
able since convention delegates
and guests will occupy all of

- Tower A and half of Tower B,

while Tower C will be occupied
by freshmen and graduate wom-
en. -
The housing 7of undergraduate
men is the remaining problem.
Recall that the Nurse’s Residence
will be partially empty due to
the departure of women to Tow-
er C. The remaining undergrad-
uate men will move into the
Nurse’s Residence and the arch-
itectural difficulty of removing
shower curtains should not prove
to insurmountable.

Graduate Students, Tower C

Women Question
Dorm Move

Editor, The Pitt News:

-A_ little further explanation is’

due on the statement by the
Dean of Women’s Office on the
arrangements being made for
freshmen women who are to
live in Tower C during the fall
trimester. '

It is rather illogical that sud-
denly "the “technical problems"
will be solved and the once ma-
jor, now seemingly minor, de-
tails such -as installing a desk
for sign-out procedures in the
lobby, controlling (or is it not
controlling) elevator usage, etc.
can be worked out satisfactorily
for freshmen women in thefall,
but were quite insolvable for the
women enrolled for the spring
trimester.

—. It . seems unfair that the air
conditioned Towers were unavail-
able and totally unfeasable for
spring trimester students( most
of whom'had already completed
at least one year under Pitt’s
dorm rules for women); yet, the
buildings can be “prepared to
accommodate freshmen women”
entering in the fall.

After suffering the inconveni-
ence of having people moved in
and out of our suites at the Uni-
versity’s discretion, we cannot
help but look with longing at
the private rooms that were un-
available, and totally unfeasable
for us.

     the Miser‘  L ' i T

  Prof Discusses Play

This is the second of two arti-
cles designed to better acquaint
University students with the pro-
ductions of the'Uni'versity Thea-
tre. The articles are, concerned
with this summer’s production of
M oliere’s comedy The Miser which
will be presented June 17, 19, 25
and 26 at 8:30 p.m. in Stephen
Foster Memorial Auditorium.

The following article was writ-
ten by Dr. Robert Whitman, as-
sociate professor of English.

The Miser is representa-

tive of Moliere at his best.’

A brilliant fusion of broad
farce, polis-hed wit, and cor-
rosive satire, the play takes
as its province not only the
follies of its milieu, Parisian up-
per-middle class society of the
mid‘ 17th century, but also the
absurdities and pathos inherent
in the nature of man.

The image of Harpagon, the ob-

, sessive miser, for whom love of
money has replaced wife, chil-

 

dren, friends and all, is wildly
comic. And yet, in the scene that
focuses most sharply. on his av-
arice, the passionate outcry of the
betrayed lover to his lost money,
the miser emerges as a profound-
ly pathetic ﬁgure.

BY giving his full devotion to
a mere thing, Harpagon has so

perverted his own nature, that

he "has wholly ‘isolated himself
from any kind of genuine and
mﬁavningful human intercourse.

Even the absurdly contrived
resolution of all the difficulties

at the end of the play, although
in keeping with the comic mood,
has its serious implications, by
reminding us that in the real

world, the price of man’s b‘e-'

trayal of his own nature is not so
easily paid. , '
And yet for all this, The Miser
is never anything less than rich-
ly comic. It is just this capacity
for balance and control, for be-
ing serious without being solemn,
for being funny without descend-
ing to the silly and trival, that
has earned .Moliere universal
