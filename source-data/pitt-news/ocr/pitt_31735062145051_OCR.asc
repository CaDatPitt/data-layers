Show Deep Interest
In Panthers Trip West

Alumni on the Paciﬁc Coast are
very much interested in the coming
trip of the Golden Panthers to play
.the Tournament of Roses game at
Pasadena, against Stanford. Before
the State game, when there was
some doubt as to who would be in-
vitedto take this trip, coast. alumni
got real busy and boosted the stock
of the Panthers to everyone they
met, including newspapers, etc.

Among‘ the alumni who‘ were

Dr. John W. Shuinan, prime mover
‘back of the Southern California Pitt
Club, whose address is Suite‘ 820,
West Lake Professional Building,
2007, Wilshire Boulevard, Los An-
geles. Dr. Shuman has a wide ac-
uaintance in Los Angeles, especial-
= y among the sports» writers of that
city. He played football here years
ago, and he knows the athletic con-
ditions at Pitt, so he was a good
press agent. .
Others‘ heard from were M. W

impress the people with the record
of the Panthers and the desirability
of their being‘ invited to the coast.

. Needless to say, these alumni and
hundreds of others who are on the
coast and in the Middle_West, will
be on hand at the Pasadena Bowl
January 2 to see the Panthers er-
form. It is anopportunit ‘to w ich

_._..__.....o_..__........

She sits in front of me and spoils a class I could otherwise en-
joy. Always when I see her ﬁdget in her seat, I pray she will -not
look a.round—-I saw her face once. Her map‘ of blond hair perches
in aknot on the back of her head, and countless little pins jut from
the knob as from a frayed pin cushion. Perhaps if she used bigger
pins her ﬁngers would not always be jogging them into new places.
Yet I like to watch her hands caressing. that pile-‘-whitehands with
ﬁngers that taper without *a. bulge to the pink tips, hands that would

' be more ‘at home conjuring sonatas from _the keyboard of a piano.

dirty strands that have escaped those pins.

Three little glrls crept through the unlatched shutter,of- the1,b_i‘g.

blue trousers, up pastthe folds of his uniform’ coat to his hands,
folded betweentwo cherished medals. His beard, its pink paler now‘
that the white hairs outnumbered the red, had been trimmed to a
point. His face, thinner, and just a little less white than the"sa.tin
of the pillow, seemed so rested, so happy that they. longed to "kiss.

Instead, they watched his mouth corner, drawn slightly-‘to one,

had smoothed away from his eyes. He seemed younger, somehow;
younger, very tired, just testing before he sniggered and started
to tease them. ' . . ‘ I 0

They stood very still. Only their ﬁngers patted up and dpwn
the white satin frilling and the black cloth of the box covering.

LIBRARY NOTES

How many‘:

present day authors,

‘ .'American‘ or ‘-European, could qual-

ify. as having‘; “never written a dull
or unclean‘ book?”

Booth Tarkington has been paid
that compliment by William Lyon
Phelps, professor of English litera-
ture at Yale and author of a num-
ber of critical books on’ literature,
in his reading course, “The Twen-
tieth Century American Novels,”
now available at the university
library. .3

In this booklet of twenty-eight
pages Phelps introduces a few out-
standing American novelists who
write, not in studied imitation of
European standards of literature,
but with a national consciousness
that, he says, “comes directly out of
American soil.”

American Women novelists, Edith

liWharton, Annie Douglas Sedgwick,
iDorothy Canﬁeld, Willa Cather,-Zena

Gale and Edna Ferber, are discussed,
and certain of their books recom-
mended for reading. Phelps also in-
cludes the best novels by Booth
Tarkington, Sinclair Lewis, Joseph
-Hergsheimer and other authors.

D “I have included the most signi-

‘ﬁcait books,” the author states, “and
have also mentioned some of our .

most popular writers, in order that
readers of all kinds may ﬁnd some-

A thing of interest.”

This is the twenty-eighth course
which has been published in the
“Reading with a Purpose” series by
the American library association.
Discussions on English literature,
the modern essay and the modern
drama have been included in these
courses. ‘

MARINE LIFE DESCRIBED
IN BOOK BY PITT MAN

“The Wealth of the Sea,” a,com-
prehensive treatise" on the exploita-

 

. tion of the sea marine products, is

the subject of the book written by
Donald K. Tressler, Ph.' D., indus-
trial fellow at Mellon institute of

For the ‘general reader as well as
for students of commercial geogra-
phy, biology, chemistry and naviga-

tion, this volume offers an authentic
survey of the uses and economic 1rn- l1f

portance of the great variety of
products which come out of the sea.
Dr. Tressler describes the origin
and evolution of such maritime
treasures as jewels, perfumes, food-
stuffs and condiments, chemicals,

To p right-—Facult

 

sponges, furs, leather, oil‘ ai‘1d.whale-

The procuring -and preparation of

each of these represents a. large, and

in most cases, intricate industry of
which Dr. Tressler gives a detailed
account. This! book which is. pro-
fusely illustrated includes stories of
whale hunts and picturesque pearl-
diving; the history of deep-sea ﬁsh-
ing and the exploration of ocean
beds; analyses of temperature and
oceanic conditions and movements,

During her lecture
tours, Miss Ekrem has met women
who have not lived at home with
their parents ‘since graduation from
college. On the, other hand, when
Miss Ekrem wished to come to
America, she had to beg permission
from her parents for a longwhile,

eventhough they are liberal in com- ‘

Girls in Turkey spend even their
time for ‘recreation with their fam-
ilies.’ After dinner in the evening
the family sings, plays, or reads to-

go riding, the family in a bodygoes
off in the car.

From her two short visits to the
United States, Miss Ekrem was im-
pressed with American speed. _“Ev-.

“The people even eat fast.” The

Welch, Kern Named
On All-American
Elevense

Althou h hardly a week has pass-
ed since utherland’s Goldmen rang
down the curtain on the_ home
football season,» several Panthers
have already been named. on All-
American selections. Captain Gib-_
by Welch and Big Bill Kern are the
favored stars. .

Inwbeing chosen.on. the United
Press All-American team, selected
by sports editors. of United Press
newspapers throughout the country.
9 nd upon recommendation of ‘ leading
coaches,- Gibbyfwas the only local
star’ honored‘ and one of the three

Eastern players chosen.‘ “We ‘ choose;
Welch because he is thebest back
in the East,”"agreed. the namers of
this All-Star combinati_on/.:.~

The New York Sun’ announced
its All-American football selection
for 1927, featured by the choice of
Welch on’ the first team and Bill

Kern on. the’ second; The selections:

were based on a canvass of 129 col-
lege teams throughout the country.
Gibby was given his customary
rirrht halfback position on the first
team and Bill Kern, outstanding
Golden tackle, drew the left tackle
assignment on this official team.
Welch was also placed on the All-
Ifastern eleven, in‘ fact no All-Star
team has been namedﬂto date with-

out the nameof. the. famous Welch.

Bil1Roper, Princeton coach, [also
n°med Gibby on his All-American;
Glenn Presnell, who played bang-
up, football at the stadium, was
 need. on the second teams of
both above All-American selections.
 And so Pitt has another name «to-
add to its listof All—American men
which includes: Peck, center, 1915-

19161. Herron, end, 1915-16 ;_. I-lilty,

tackle, Davies, halfback,‘ 1918; Stein,
center, 1920,‘ Bowseif, center, 1922;
Bohren, halfback,‘ 19239; Wissinger,
1924, and Chase,,tackle, 1925..

Friday night, Grantland Rice,.the ~
foremost football authority in the .

land -will announce. his All-Amen
ican team over the radio, and. the
reasons-' for his choice. So if you
want to know why Gibby» Welch is a
unanimous All-American choice af-
ter, having seen‘ him play in even
one game this season, just tune‘ in
Friday night and Mr. Rice will tell
you, and if he does not all we can
say’s that he might know something
about golf. »

Intimations that Joe Donchess,
crack Panther wingman, may ap-
pear on Grantland Ricefs All-Amen

statement in Rice sport column,

“Pittsburgh had one of the best ends

of the year in Donchess.” Joe was

“The passing attack. and the de-

Pop: as his eyes sparkled behind his

* In commenting on Captain Gibby’s
excellent performance during the
day, “It was the first time I ever

1 saw that elusive Gibby in action but

believe me he’s some halfback! As
I have often stated, Ernie N evers of
my Cardinals’ is the best player in

the country but he is altogether a

different type of player than Welch.
Nevers isva plunging fullback» while
Gibby is a ﬂeety heads-up halfback.
Gibby has the stuff that all-Ameri-
cans are made of.”.

.In.his' usual modest way Coach

‘Warner informed, “The game on the

Coast 'New.Year’s Day will be a
har_d_jfo"ught battle. After seeing
the. Panthers in action I am inclined
to favor them over my Stanford
team.’ Both teams play the same
brand of ball and a Welch—I-Iolfman

Sutherland and his ‘aides fully
realized the capabilities of the
strong team from Nebraska and
knew that only a cleverer and
smoother team could defeat them.
"Nebraska came here with .a record
-of having won every game except
one,‘ and that an early season; up-
set at the hands of Missouri by the
not-humiliating score of 7-6. It
‘__was“an ambitious job toitackle those
Nebraska jboys especially. after how
_the Nebraskans of 1921 upset a
‘good Warner team by the score of
10-0‘; But Sutherland‘ was both am-
bi\t‘io,us and silent. He versed his
‘men’? in both these, and in the art
.of building a defense to break down

braska was noted for. is

made runs of .93 and 65 yards, Ha-
'gaii};tore off 63 yards, while Pres-
,nelliiiof,_the Nebraska team scored
ruiisgof 38_..and 20 yards. Welch
catchingithe opening kick-off on his
ozvn seven-yard line raced through
the entire western team for a touch-
down. - Nebraska came back strong
and deadlocked the score by inter-
cepting a forward. Hagan soon put

then caught a forward -hurled by
