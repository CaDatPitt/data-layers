Russian Reporter

Discusses

By DAN BOOKER

Ten people sat around a
table in ,2.3.06CL, Thursday.
Nine of these were "Univers-
ity graduate and undergrad-
uate students and they dis-
cussed the United States
policy in Vietnam. The tenth man
was Stanislas Kondrashov, the
United Nations correspondent for
the Soviet newspaper, Izvestia.

Kondrashov is currently. trav-
eling across the country trying to
gauge the attitude of Americans
toward the Vietnam war. The re-
actions he received from Univer-
sity students and Cornell Univer-
sity students will be the basis for
at least one of his articles for
Izvestia.

The Russian reporter found that
none of the students present sup-
ported President Lyndon John-
son’s policy wholeheartedly. Mah-

Mellon Gives Funds for Ruskin

(See editorial, Page -1)

A $1,075,475 gift from
Pittsburgh. financier Rich-
ard K. Mellon has enabled
the University to retain the
Ruskin Apartments in Oak-
land and use them to house

-medical students and hospital
personnel.‘ -

Receipt of the gift was an-
nounced by Acting ‘Chancellor
David H. Kurtzman.

Dr. Kurtzman said -the new.
funds would enable the Univer-
sity to reﬁnance the apartment

building at 120 Ruskin Ave. and‘
to reduce the indebtedness on it. ..

This, it is hoped will allow the
University to operate the Ruskin
with rentals reasonable enough
to attract medical students and
members of the house staffs of
hospitals in the University Health
Center.

Dr. Kurtzman emphasized that
facilities in the building would

be offered to the ‘new clientele
only as apartments become va-
cant; none of the present tenants
will be asked to move. Approxi-
mately 35 of the apartments pres-
ently are out of use and will be
converted to the new purpose im-
mediately.

“This will be a distinct bene-
ﬁt to the University and the
Health Center Hospitals‘/’ Dr.
Kurtzman said, “and undoubted-
ly will have an impact both on
the teaching of medicine and the
quality of medical personnel. Re-
cent studies have shown that the
University faces stiff competition
in its search for outstanding med-
ical students, and the affiliated
hospitals in the University Health
Center face similar problems in
obtaining “house staffs. The pro-
visions of adequate and reason-
able housing for these people,
many of whom are married and
1*.-avefamilies, is one of the more
effective aids in recruiting.”

Blind Students Attend-
English Courses Here A

, By BERNI MCLEOD

Twenty blind students will re-
ceive a taste of college this sum-
mer, through course work at the
University. From June .23 until
July 21, they will take‘ Freshman
English composition, in prepar-
ing to attend various Pennsyl-
vania colleges this fall.

The students, who will he stay-
ing at the, Western Pennsylvania
School for theiBlind, are the sec-
ond group to participate in this
annual program, initiated last
summer by Dr. Ferson, the assis-'
tant superintendent and psycho-
logist at the School for the Blind.

This year, the ,University’s
YWCA_ is planning to help. with
the program, WY re-all a,

   

sity and area college blind stu-

dents with their studies during

the‘fall and winter trimester.
This summer, volunteers in'the

Reader Service program will read
"to the group of students and as-

sist them in the library. The proj-
ect is headed by Ruth Schilke, a
junior psychology major from Ir-
win, Pa., who has been with
Reader Service since her fresh-
man year. '

According to Miss Sghilke, “the

course ‘will help the blind stu— ’

dents become oriented to a Uni-
versity with all its pressures and

  
 

tional advantage, Dr. Kurtzman

‘ said, inhousing medical students

together with young physicians.
“We are grateful to Mr. Mellon,”
he added, “for his continuing in-
terest in the University and his
continuing sensitivity to speciﬁc
problems in education as exempli-
ﬁed by this generous gift.”

Part of thefunds provided by

the gift will be used to make

needed structural repairs in the
building and to install a self-.
service laundry for tenants.-

Scranton Has

“No Offers”
On Pitt Post

At a special press conference
held last week Governor William
W. Scranton stated that nobody
had offered him any kindof job
—-“and that includes the chancel-

\/lorship of_the University of Pitts-

burgh.” ‘ _
Early last winter talk began
that Governor Scranton might be-

, comethe next chancellor of the

University. State Senator Albert
Pechan, a member of the Univer-
sity‘s Board of . Trustees, stated
that he felt Scranton would make

an excellent candidate for the -

post, which is temporarily being
ﬁlled by Dr. David A. Kurtzman.

At the press conference, the.

Governor also ﬂatly stated that
he would “not ever run for pub-
lic office again.”

The Governor’s statement start-
led many people since the gener-
al opinion in national political

circles has been that he would .

seek the Republican nomination
for president again in 19_68.

were the most outspoken critics.
They said that they objected to
the war mainly on the grounds
that the bombing of North Viet-
nam Was wrong on a moral basis;
This problem of the bombing,_
noted Kondrashov, is one of the’
greatest importance to his Rus-
sian readers. He asked whether,
“Americans just don’t think about
it (the bombing) or do they just‘-K
want to ignore it?” The students
answered that they felt that mor-
al considerations were generally:
overriden by the international re-f
percussions of the war. They also
told the correspondent that the
moral implications of the bomb-
ing aren’t considered by the
American people because it is" an?
impersonal form of destruction‘
as compared to the tortures re-
portedly used by the Viet Cong;
As the students switched their
discussion from the bombing to
the nature of the Red Chinese
threat in Southeast Asia, Kon-
drashov sat back and just liste 
ed. The argument centered on,
what effect the present. U. S. poli-
cy has on Chinese expansionismﬁ
One student, Pete Galie, felt that
the present policy has had- the
effect of checking this expansion-
ism. But the other students a '
gued that Chinese inﬂuence
being enhanced because the e A.
no one else to whom the North
Vietnam and the National Libera-
tion’ Front could turn. Kondras-
hov shook his head in agreement
and marked the high" points of
the discussion in his notebook,
Later, the correspondent noted
that Americans generally seemtto,
feel that “one Chinese dolla
'more expansionistic than a }m-11:-
lion U. S. dollars.” He also said
that he thought world lead
such as U Thant, secretary ge
eral of the United Nations, "we

Finally, Kondrashov asked ;the‘
students what ‘they felt the ge

. By »DON DE CESARE

, Lately, the entertainment
“adage, “stick with a good
thing until the public gets
sick of, it,” has been applied
to converting Broadway mu-
Vsicals into movies. From Mu-
ksic Man to My Fair Lady and The
' Sound of Music, Hollywood has
turned almost every popular or
successful Broadway musical in-
. to a phenomenally successful mo-
jf_'tion picture. A new adage, “it it
works on Broadway, it’ll work
,in the movies,” seems to have
ijmonopoliied producer’s thoughts.
A As;a result some Broadway shows
if not-suited to the movies become
movies anyway. This is the case

;‘-with Stop the World—I Want t

..:Get Off. ,
_  Stop the World, which An-
7 thony Newley in a live perform-

__-__”ance‘ could make only a decent

show, is not much more than a
~ curious motion picture. The
‘ show’s necessary lack of scenery
and its too obvious use of alle-
. gory, -create serious problems for

a motion picture director. The
‘attention of an audience is easily
lost. Philip Saville, the director,
Ahas tried to solve the attention
*problem by making the movie

Stop The Whirl

into a semi-documentary limita-
tion of a live stage performance,
interspersing some tricky camera
work. He almost pulls it off. But
the show’s inherent weaknesses
only become magniﬁed without
the spontaneity of a live per-
formance. S

The plot is dead. It seems
there’s this fellow, appropriately
named Little Chap, who starts
at the bottom of the ladder in a
large industrial ﬁrm and ruth-
lessly works his way to the top.
On the way, to prove something-
to himself, -he conquers every
woman in sight. Naturally, his
lawful wife spurns him — but
never really loses faith in him
Old age brings reconciliation and
understanding. How simple can
you get! Tony Tanner in Newly's
role as Little Chap is good, but
the part’s possibilities are too
limited. Little Chap simply does-
n’t have anything new to say.

The movie's best performances
comes from Millicent Martin, who
bounces through a series of roles
with great enthusiasm and abil-
ity. Her charicatures of British,
Russian, and American coquettes
achieve the right note of satire.
And her good looks are always
worthwhile.

The music has to be the big-

young girl say: “These people

they were lost was crazy. They

Then came the “Religious Gen-

They were termed “vital, alive

If Stop the World—I Want to
Get Off is a director’s experiment
in the staging of movie musicals,
it is interesting but not success-

have been made into a movie.

Junior Wins
Political
Internship

Robert Hartland, a junior ma-
joring in political science, has
been awarded the Gow Internship
in practical politics. Hartland
will be working for the Republi-
can Executive Committee of Al-
legheny County under George
Pott, the Republican party chair-
man. The internship is for the
entire month of August and part
time work up until the November
elections.

To apply for the Gow Award,
Hartland had to submit an essay
stating why he wanted the in-
ternship. In his paper, he men-
tioned certain goals which he
hoped to achieve.

“I want to be able to contri-
bute to the functioning of the
Government and change that
which needs changing and make
whats good even better. I would
also like to help others under-
stand what their government and
political systems are all about.”

Hartland who hopes to make
politics his career expressed his
gratitude to Dr. Edward Cooke

-who is the’ campus advisor for

the Pennsylvania Center for Ed-
ucation and Politics, and Dr. Mor-
ris Ogul for assistance and en-
couragement.

 Franconia College
Offers Flexible Program

A new solution to a longstand-
ing problem of small colleges was
‘announced on May 1 by Fran-
conia College, a three-year—old

liberal arts institution in the
White Mountains of New Hamp-
shire.

The problem: How can a small
college provide the varied aca-
demic program which is increas-
ingly needed and demanded by
today’s college students? The so-
lutio_n: Franconia’s new Upper
Division Program, which ‘offers
mature, high motivated college
juniors the opportunity to design
and pursue a ﬂexible A B curri-
culum, using any facilities in the
world -which can help them meet
their educational goals.

Although Upper Division Stu-‘

A‘;-/5" dents may take courses on the
Franconia campus, many of them
will spend a signiﬁcant portion

, of their time away from the Col-
lege in a variety of work, study,
and research situations.

“We want Upper'Division Stu-
dents to take advantage of the
teachers, facilities, and programs
which will best fulﬁll thir needs,”
said Franconia. President Richard
R. Ruopp in announcing the U1)-
per Division, “Now we have found
a way to keep these wide-rang-

. ing activities under the personal
supervision which only a very
small college such as Franconia
can provide.

Public announcement of the
program comes after two years
of planning and testing. An ‘ini-
tial group of Upper Division stu-
dents are now pursuing their
studies in a wide variety of sit-

' uations: one is a VISTA volunteer

studying Eskimo culture in an
Alaskan ﬁshing village; another

is gaining laboratory experience‘.

at the Cornell University Medical
Center in New York City; another
is helping a grouplof Navajo In-
dians ‘set up their own businesses"
on a New Mexico reservation.
Franconia’s new program is
planned for a limited number of
students who have their educa-
tional goals clearly in mind. Ad-
. mission to the program is based
' on a “letter of intent,” in which
a student proposes his own course
of study after consulting with a

agreed to work with him in the
Upper Division. To qualify f0I‘
admission, applicants must pass a
comprehensive examination in
the humanities. Applicants from
Franconia’s own Lower Division
wil lhave taken the college’s two-
year “Core” humanities curricu-
lum.. transfer students are ex-
pected to have done equivalent

' work elesewhere.

A Height of Absurdity

Selective Service Exam

By Robert Zwuos

I sat looking at my ink-smeared left hand after I had
impressed my ﬁngerprint on the Selective Service identiﬁca-
tion card and began to laugh as I thought of the absurdity
 of the entire situation.

It was 8:40 on a Saturday morning and by all laws of
men and reason I should have been tucked snuggly away
waiting for the noon ring of my alarm clock. But instead, I
sat sleepily in the back of the lecture hall waiting for the
test to begin. I was not in the top 25 per cent of my class
sohl liad to score above 80 to be allowed to enter graduate
sc oo.

\

on the answer sheet (so that the machine “knew who we
were”) the test began. ‘

I read the directions for the first section-—FIND THE
WORD MOST NEARLY OPPOSITE. The ﬁrst word was
“happy! The choice were: orange, jump, clock, Superman,
..-and sad. _

_ At ﬁrst I thought it must have been the sample ques-
tion. I looked again—it was numbered “1” and there was no
answer. Right below it came number “2.” I looked through
the rest of the words. They were all the same-—words which
could be found in See Tom, Dick and Jane reader.

th “Okay, if they want to play games I’ll go along with

em.”

‘ I THE SYNONYM SECTION came next. Some of the
words near the end were a little harder, but I was a grad-
uate of 30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary so I got
most of them.

~- I had learned early that memorizing vocabularly words
increased aptitude and intelligence test score signiﬁcantly,
contrary to what the people who administer the tests would
like us to believe.

_ When I started the arithmetic section I almost fell out
of my chair! I had been tutoring an eighth grade girl in
arithmetic and the questions looked like they came out of
her.Fun with Mathematics text.

The ﬁrst problem was 1/7 divided by 2/5. All you have
todo is invert the second fraction and multiply, or maybe
you invert the ﬁrst. No matter though, the next question
was pretty easy: 6f‘ = ?. Choices were: 6 + 6 + 6 +6, 24,
6x6x6x6,64,and13.

7 “Well maybe every test should include a few easy ques-
tions so nobody will get discouraged,” I thought as I con-
tinued. But alas. the next page of questions was the same!
‘ THE ROUGHEST PROBLEM was ﬁnding the area of a
rapezoid which was drawn way out of porportion in order
to be tricky. A 15 inch altitude was drawn_longer than a
25 inch base. Geometry might have never made it into the
high school curriculum if Euclid had been as lax! ,
The reading comprehension action seemed to be a little
more sane. The sections were drawn from different ﬁelds so
as not‘ to favor any particular college major. However, the
‘graph analysis section followed the trend of the vocabulary
‘and arithmetic section.

 Any math student would know that graphs are used to
show a relationship between two variables. But when a prob-
lem on the test involved ﬁve variables on the same graph
the situation became quite hairy.

‘ The climax of ineptness came on the ﬁnal graph section,

»'-ﬁnding out if one particular line was less than or more than
{ﬁve times another. Now, if I had brought my millimeter rule
.I might have been able to do it, but unfortunately I didn’t.
L‘ . It was rather symbolic that the sky was gloomy and
rainy as,I walked out of the testing room. Most of the other
:; Silas were laughing since the test had been such a snap.
But I wasn't laughing, because I was remembering why we
‘ad to take the test to begin with.

the favor of the Mellons. Yet there is much to grieve. We live in a city
where industrialists have billions to donate. Yet the trend of the Mellon
donations indicate that the catholic approach of a Litchfield is to be con-

demned. A balanced budget seems to be more appreciated than plans for
superior educational facilities.

Pittsburgh will never fulfill the wish of the late Alan M. Scaife for

one of the “world’s great universities” if hard fiscal lines border the
dreams of men. When Chancellor John G. Bowman began building the
Cathedral of Learning the University was faced with a $2 million debt.
Yet he held strong to his vision of a great building to inspire Pittsburgh
adolescents and he bitterly fought those who opposed the Cathedral's cost.

When Dr. Litchfield left the University, we face a $20 million debt.
But the school had attained greater stature then it ever knew before. It
then appears there is a rather low correlation between ﬁnancial security
and University growth. '

We can only hope that men like Mellon will realize that solid com-
munity support of brillance of plan is the crucial key toprogress. If they

do then perhaps the late Mr. Scaife’s dream of the year’s past will be a

reality.

Marine Questions .

, Student Opposition-

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing this letter on my
behalf and at the request of sev-
eral Pennsylvania Marines sta-
tioned with the third batallion,
First Marine Regiment here at,
Chu Lai in South Vietnam. We
don't hear much of what is going
on in the United Statesor on the
cther side of the world except
what they transmit over the Armd
ed Forces Radio Station here,
which isn’t much. The only thing
they keep us informed on is our
enemy. But we have heard that;
the college and university stu-
dents in the United States are
demonstrating against our gov-
ernment’s policy in Vietnam. It
really hurts the ﬁghting morale

of, troops, here, whether they be

Marines, soldiers or sailors, to
think that the future leaders,‘
businessmen and women of Amer-
ica won't even go along with the

policy of the United States on. ~

Vietnam.

The people of the United States
may feel this is not our war.
True, we are ﬁghting the war of
the people of South Vietnam, but
in reality we are ﬁghting oui7
own war—a war against Com-
munism and its aggression. Wherl
we are on the battle ﬁeld we‘
don't think of protecting the peo-
ple of South Vietnam, we think
of protecting our families and

good men who are giving their
lives in this ﬁght. But to us, the

‘ones God has left behind to con-

tinue ‘this struggle, we feel our
fellow Marines and ﬁghting men
have not died in vain. We feel
that they have died for the same
reason that thousands of other
Americans have died in the past
centuries—to preserve and pro-
tect our heritage.

Why should we, the Armed
Forces of the United States ﬁght
in this remote, God forsaken, jun-
gle infested country when our
efforts not only aren’t appreci-
ated, but are demonstrated against.
Why? Because we have answered
the call of our government to pro-
tect and preserve democracy des-
pite the feelings of some Ameri-
cans. This is how the American

‘ﬁghting men, in Vietnam feel

about this war.

As residents of the state of
Pennsylvania, myself and my fel-
low Marines hope that the stu-
dents of the University of Pitts-
burgh do not participate in anti-
Vietnam demonstrations.

Editor, The Pitt News:

Robert Bly, a well-established
poet who participated in a re-
cent Cornell University “read-in”
to end the war in Vietnam, came
forth with a rather prefactory
statement. He referred to Presi-
dent Johnson as a “slimy, bas-
tard.” We listened and we were
stunned. Even admitting that
Johnson was the scapegoat for his
comment and the degrading draft
System used to support our “war
for democracy,” ‘we could not
help but wonder if there wasn't
an element of treason in his
words.

The Saturdays came and we
trotted off to the war boards.
Twenty-eight hundred on the
campus herded themselves into
classrooms to ensure that it was
their roommate or the unknown
guy behind them, not themselves,
who might die in war. There
were 2,800 frightened faces lis-
tening to the proctors as they
read the last paragraph of the
prepared instructions informing
us that “anyone creating a dis-
turbance would be committing a
federal offense punishable by no
more than ﬁve years in prison
and/or a $10,000 ﬁne.” These

Editor, The Pitt News:

Although irritated by the ini-

strained my impulse to reply.
This restraint was prompted not
merely by sentiments of charity,
but also by a lack of appetite for
soiling myself by engaging deni-
zens of the gutter on their own
terms. His second offering (May
23) indicates, however, that his
earlier aberration was not mere-
ly temporary, and requires some

Perils of Predicting

l7Vith.all due respect to the Computer Age, I hereby submit my
qualiﬁcations to replace the computerized system of predicting elec-

NOT ONCE did I ever vary in consistency. As campaign manager 
for Student Government presidential candidate Marty Engels in the 
January, 1966, election, I emerged as a supporter not of the runner-
up, but of the third-place candidate in a three-man race. My record 
was untouched by any glimmer of near-success—-only complete failure. '

Undaunted by my experience in 

student politics, I eagerly backed
State Senator Robert P. Casey for
the Pennsylvania Democratic gu-
bernatorial nomination. After the
Pennsylvania Democratic State
Policy Committee backed my can-
didate, I though I was at last on
the" threshold of victory. After
all, Pennsylvania is known for its
machine politics. No candidate
would beat the machine. On pri-

Beset by frustration early
in the season and dismay
late in the season, the base-
ball team may never want to
look back into the past. But by
next year coach Bobby Lewis’
comparatively young team may

DAVE WELTY reveals the form that might lead him on to the major
leagues. He was the baseball team's top pitcher and hitter.

“Since anything can happen in
baseball, I decided to get at least
two years of a college education
before even considering the ma-
jors. And most likely I’ll ﬁnish
here before I try anything-

“I want to go all the way if I
can since not too many people
ever get the chance. They say if
you have the stuff the scouts will
follow you. Right now I'm streak-
ing. I just hope it stays that
way.”

Welty, a lefthanded fastballer,
has learned most of his lessons
in local sandlot ball. His story is

The learning process for the
young star is nowhere near over.
The major problem confronting
the busy Panther now is whether
to concentrate on his pitching or
hitting. But considering that ei-
ther one could earn him a pro
bid it’s quite an enviable prob-
lem.

ents and not the weather spoiled
their hopes. The Panthers ended
the year with eight wins and 10
losses.

In a Forbes Field doublehead-
er, Penn State ﬁgured .out left.-
hgander Dave Welty in the first
inning for seven runs. The ﬁnal
score was 8-1. In the second
game, the Lions had it even easi-
er, winning 15-1.

After losing to Kent State, 9-3,
the baseball team dropped a dou-
bleheader to Southern Illinois, in
a night mare reminiscent of State,
10-1 and 10-0. ‘

Next year, however, Lewis may
still have problems with the
weather, but he shouldn’t be
plagued by inexperience, for all
but four players are returning.

JIM McKEON tees up in match against Penn State several weeks ago..

The golfers gave quite a scare to the Eastern champions before how-

after 18 holes, only to lose in sudden death.

Tennis Team?
Forecasts

YouthfulLook

As the tennis team trouped off
the court after their 9-0 loss to
Penn Statethey raised that fami-
liar cry, “Wait till next year.”

Things are bound to look up
for the players who have suffer‘-

The fact that Jim McKeon
could come here from the

small Johnstown campus of
the University and establish him-
self as the top golfer on Rex
Peery’s team in his ﬁrst year at
the big school might be used by
some people as further evidence
of the poor quality of the golf
team. But not if you know Jim
McKeon.

McKeon took up golf when he
was in the service, and found that
the game came easy. When he
entered Johnston College he ‘went
out for the golf team, and for two
years, 1963 and 1964, was the
Pennsylvania Junior College golf
champion. In 1964 the Johnstown
campus also won the team‘title.

Thus, it was no wonder that
Rex Peery looked upon McKeon’s
arrival here with fondness. How-
ever, upon arriving McKeon was

plagues many other athletes at
Pitt-—no place to practice. “I went
up to the women’s gym at night
and hit golf balls into a net. I
did this for most of the Winter.”
McKeon credits this as a big fac-
tor in his scoring in the 70’s from
the beginning of the season.
