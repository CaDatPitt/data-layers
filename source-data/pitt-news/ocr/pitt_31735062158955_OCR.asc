The Critic Of Boston
Discovers That People

6 Look Like People

By ALICE BENOVITZ

It seems that a certain Moses
Smith, music critic of the Bos-
ton Evening Transcript‘, came
to Pittsburgh a few weeks ago
to hear Dr. Otto Klemperer con-
duct the Pittsburgh Symphony.

Excerpts from the criticisms
were reprinted in the symphony
program of last Friday. While the
Symphony Society might be
pleased by the rather favorable
write-up, I take exception to
many of Mr. Smith's remarks.

He began his article “The art
of playing symphonic music in
America does not begin and end
in the three capitals of the Atlan-
tic seaboard—Bos-ton, New York
and Phi1adelphia———where the art
has been developed to a superla-
tive degree . . .”

Chilled Culture

This is stmply a negative method
of stating that Mr. Smith thinks it
does. Perhaps Boston has not as
yet officially recognized the terri-
tory west of the Alleghenies, but
I have heard on fairly reliable in-
formation that there are symphony
orchestras in .Cincinnati, Los An-
geles, Minneapolis, St. Louis, De-
troit, San Francisco, and Chicago.
However this may be a malicious
rumor to discount that city of
chilled culture, Boston.

He went on to say that there was
“surprisingly good balance be-

tween the choirs and instruments.” .

Hundreds of musicians were audi-
tioned before the reorganization of
the symphony; soloists were called
from well—pa.id positions in fa-.
mous orchestras; Dr. Klemperer,
one of Germany’s and Ameriea’s
most outstanding conductors led
the orchestra and Mr. Smith says
“surprisingly good balance.” I
fail to see anything so surprising
about that.

But the piece de resistance, the
tops, the climax came in his state-
ment “Closing one eye to the
scene one might almost have mis-
taken the audience, from its de-
meanor and department, as the
kind of aggregation one meets in
Symphony Hall in Boston. Ambi-
tion for musical culture, one was
happy to discover,‘ is not confined
to the middle Atlantic seaboard.”

See No Evil

Probably the reason Mr. Smith
did not close both eyes was that if
anyone did that in Boston, he
would freeze to. death. Then too,
Mr. Smith. may not have felt en-
tirely. at home. .

One must learn to listen to
Chavez's “H. P." or Ravel’s “Bo-
lero”—if they play such sacri-
legious pieces in Boston—without
a thrill of excitement, One must
be 891.6. t9.f.al1: asleep in the sec.-
ond. m9veui§:nt..o£, '1TS¢haili0wsk3"s
“Fourth Syxnphony.”: Thate is, one.
must, if one is to be a true Bos-
tonian.

But all you need» in Pittsburgh to
be included" in a large group of
symphony goers is a love for mu-
sic and a vibrant enthusiasm to
make the  Symphony
more of a success each year.

As for. you, Mr. Smith, it was
nice havingy-ou._ —

the bottom of the page and turn
them in today at the Pitt News of-
fice, 817 Cathedral, or put them in
boxes placed at several stations
in the Cathedral.

These ballots will be counted

tained can anything be accom-
plished.”

trick of finance to sabotage “re-

“more sympathetic view towards

up construction and expansion.

But you-' might have expected

Reasons For Mediation

Germanv’s Wish To End Sino-Japanese War
Not Attributed To Any Desire For Peace

By Irving

V\'hile American marines,

Kaufman

British ’l‘ommiesA, and French

poilus were throwing a few sour notes into the Banzais of the
Japanese victory marchers, the Nazis were trying to pull a

sleeper.
Recognizing the inability of

the democratic nations to check

the Japanese land grab, and, according to the observers, realiz-
ing the glory that would descend upon them and their haloed

leader if they could end the

Sino-Japanese “ incident, ’ ’ the

German government has expressed
a willingness to act as mediator.
In fact, they are so willing to end
the war, that they even sent their
envoy, Dr. Oscar Trautman on a
special mission to Chiang Kai-
Shek’s Hankow hide-away.
QUESTION MOTIVES

Most observers have stated that ‘

Hitler wants to settle thewar in
Asia in order to make the demo-
cratic bloc of nations and their
anti-Fascist inspired Brussels Con-
ference look weak and vacillating.
This may be so, but it looks ﬁshy.
Hitler, who as yet has not been a
candidate for the Nobel Peace
Prize, is not in this mediating bus-
iness for nothing. He’s got some-
thing up his sleeve besides a
swastika and his “eratz” red ﬂan-
nels. (On second thought, I. doubt
if Hitler’s ﬂannels would be red.)

REASONS FOR MEDIATION

There are several possible other
reasons for Hitler’s anxious will-
ingness to end the war. Although
they are winning, the fearsome
reputation of the Japanese military
has been deﬂated if not deﬁnitely
ﬂattened. The Nipponese soldier
is no longer thought to be the mar-
velous ﬁghting robot he once was
considered. Hitler, being an out-
and-out ally of the Japanese, does
not like to see his little yellow
friends tarnish their reputation.
It might indirectly reﬂect on his
goose-stepping iron men. Some
people might think that the effi-
ciency of the totalitarian armies
has been over rated. Then, too,
the Germans and Italians don’t
like to see the Japanese weaken
themselves chasing the Chinese
and stepping on hidden land mines,
etc. They want the Japanese to be
at full strength for the real McCoy
war against Russia; they don’t
want Japan to waste its energies
in the prelims.

JAPANESE PREFERENCE
Another factor is that Japan
would do a lot better with Ger-
many refereeing the peace settle-
ment than she would with France
or Great Britain acting ‘as medi-
ator.‘ Hitler probably realizes this,
and‘ since he’s an old hand at ig-
noring treaties and settlements, he
wouldn’t ﬁnd it too hard on his
conscience if his mediators should
close their collective eyes and let
After

many, couldn‘t squawk, and the

Pitt Cagers Hop Pullmans,
Open Season In Midwest

Meet Wildcats °

In First Game;
Badgers Next

By KAL KALVVARY

I’it.t’s Golden Panthers will
o-pen thehoop season tonight,
jeopardizing D 1'. C-arlson’s
wide--spread ultimatum, ‘ ‘\Ve ’1l
win ’em all,” when they tangle
with the Northwestern ﬁve at
Evanston, Illinois.

This is the initial 19.37-38 dis-
play of the popular Pitt “ﬁgure
eight" system in its annual M1d—
western tour. The Golden Cats
will pick up the animal feud the
folioxving evening against Wiscon-
sin‘s Badgers in Madison.

Lifting the intercollegiate bas-
ketball gang-plank successfully
this season, will necessitate the co-
operative efforts of all Pitt hands.
Northwestern is that kind of a
team.

BADGERS WAITING

Pitt’s cagers will have to be
doubly on the alert against the re-
venge-minded Badgers. The Blue
and Gold courtment manhandled
them last year, and the same color
combination was none too gentle
with them on the gridiron this fall.

The Wildcats took the local
quint’s measure two years in suc-
cession, without extending them-
selves. And the Carlson club was
considerably stronger then than _it
is today. The Chicagoans will
take the floor with a squad of de-
pendable veterans, which still cen-
ters around the Midwest’s star
shot,»-L\/Lil-Ie Mclvlichaels. Pitt play-
ers elected McMichaels to their all-
opponent team last season, which
should mean something.

SPOTTY STARTING

Coeds To Begin Sports Season
With Interclass Cage Matches

Two Trophies

Will Be Given
To Grid Team

Two trophies will be awarded to
the Panther football team at the
Varsity Letter Club banquet in the
Hotel Schenley Monday evening.

The City Championship trophy
will be presented to the undefeated
gridiron squad, and for the second
successive year the Panthers will
be named as the outstanding east-
ern team with the presentation of
the Lambert Trophy. '

’l0 TEAM ATTENDING

The Monday banquet, given by
the organization of athletic-nu-
meral men, will also be the scene
of a reunion of the 1910 team. In
that year the Panthers went
through a nine.-game season unde-
feated, untied, and unscored-on. A
member of that team, Dr. Karl M.
Dallenbach, will be the principal
speaker of the evening. Now as-
sociate head of the psychology de-
partment of Cornell University,
Dr. Dallenbach is also editor of the
American Journal of Psychology.

Besides the members of the var-
sity squad, in attendance will be
members of the freshman team,
student managers, Dr. John B.
Sutherland, and his assistants. ‘ An
invitation has been extended by
George I. Carson, secretary-treas-
urer of the Varsity Letter club, to

Dame and building a few big
apartment houses around ‘the
city are among the many things
John E. McSorley has done in
the past few years. Now the
ﬂourishing landholder has some-
thing else to keep him buSY- He‘
is the new coach of the new Pitt
hockey team. , - .
_About eighteen years ago at
Schenley High School John Mc-
Sorley started his version of “lo-
cal boy makes good.” He played
hockey, football and basketball
and captained the hockey team in
his ﬁnal year to hang up a record
seldom equaled in scholastic ath-
letics. * .
SHADY SIDE NEXT
Following his marticulation at
the triangle school, he entered
Shadyside Academy and won his
spurs in hockey and football. As
in high school, he captained the
hockey squad during his senior

yearat the Fox Chapel school.
. Not content with what Shady-
side gave him in preparation for
his attack on Notre“-Dame records,
Mcsorley. enrolled in Princeton
Prep. Continuing something that

. had by this time become a habit

with him, he Lromped his way
through school, making a hero of
himself .and gathering no end of
letters and the like.

Toppinghis athletic prowess in
the amateur ranks, was his assault
on Notre Dame sports. Mcsorley
took the South Bend school for
nine letters in three sports. Hock-
ey was his best sport, however.
For three years he was one of
Notre Dame’s top ranking hockey
stars.

IRISH CAPTAIN

Mcsorley ﬁnished his last year
in Notre Dame as captain, as usual,
of the ice hockey team.

After leaving South Bend in
1928 with a degree, Pitt's latest
coaching staff addition, played
hockey in Chicago before return-
ing to Pittsburgh to erect apart-
ment houses and install himself as
one of the most popular referees
in the American International Pro-
fessional League.

John Mcsorley stands ﬁve feet
ten inches, and weighs 178 pounds.
He is graying a little at the. tem-
ples, in spite of the fact that he is
a man in his early thirties.

INIIERITED TRAIT

At the present, Mcsorley, pre-
sides in a very nice office in his
King - Edward Apartments.

Mcsorley comes by his hockey
honestly. His two brothers cap-
tained teams at Notre Dame and
Carnegie Tech. Early in collegiate
hockey history, as far back as 1915,
Arthur Mcsorley led a pioneering
band of icemen from the school
across the hollow.

Notre Dame saw its ﬁrst McSor-
ley in the early twenties and liked
him well enough to honor him
with the leadership of their hockey
outﬁt.

The only word John Mcsorley
will give out concerning his new
charges is, that they will be in-
vited to any Ice Bowl, but they
will be better than most folks will
be expecting them to be.

Double-Headers
Feature Local
Ice Schedule

Seeing Pitt on the ice will be
something new for Pitt students
and fans in the city. And the day
.isn’t far away when Pitt will help
inaugurate the lidlifter of the
Cleveland - Pittsburgh H 0 c k e y
League on the Duquesne Garden
Ice against Duquesne with Tech
and Western Reserve completing
the doubleheader.

In a schedule recently, Tuesday,
December 14 is the day set aside
in Garden activities for these teams
to open hostilities. Eight more
double headers are arranged for
local hockey fans which will carry
the playing season into the middle
of March. ,

SEVEN TEAMS

The newly formed league will
show seven teams including the
three local schools and four col-
leges in Cleveland, Baldwin-Wal-
lace, Fenn, Western Reserve and
John Carrol.

Following the lidlifter on Tues-
day the league is inactive until
after the Christmas recess. The
local season starts again in Janu-
ary when John Carroll journeys
here to face Pitt on January 19
and Tech meets Duquesne.

John McSorley, Pitt" -hockey
coach, has been in charge of the
hockey squad for a little more than
a week and in such a small amount
of time has been able to do little
more than get them organized.

INEXPERIENCED

Unlike Tech and Duke, Pitt will
take the ice needing more ex-
perience and practice, but even so,
stand a good chance of upsetting
the dope and giving Duke one
grand ﬁght.

In the league as a whole, the
western half ﬁgures to ﬁnish above
the local teams. Each of the
Cleveland schools have been play-
ing hockey for the last few years.

Tonsillectomy
Takes John
 Woodruff

JOHNNY WOODRUFF, gen-

erally acknowledged to be
the greatest half-miler in the
world ‘today, is doing very well,
thank you, after a recent ton-
sil operation. ‘ ’

The operation was necessi-
tated by an enlarged set of ton--

.sils, which were designated by
physicians as the cause for a
general impairment of t h c
Woodrutf physical efficiency.

It will be remembered that
Woodruff did not fare so well in
his competitive trip to Japan.
Responsible for that showing was
the fact that Woodruff was not
in the best physical condition.
This has been attributed to both
the change in diet and the ton-
sil ailment.

Woodruff, returning to school
early in October, did not par-
ticipate in the cross-country
season. He will resume train-
ing upon his return from the
yuletlde holidays.

Smack! 'I‘hat"s exactly what
happened when wild fists con-

ing bouts of the sixth Annaul
Infra-mural Boxing Tourna-
ment got under way.

_‘A larger number of entries
than expected made the event a
great success.

With the fine officiating of
Jack Schricker, the able handling
by Conti, and Wargo, and the
timekeeping of Willie Campbell
and Steve Petro, the first round
was run off smoothly.

VVENGRYN WINS

In the first bout of the after-
noon, two 135 pounders, Pete
Wengryn and Chuck Hawkins,
toed the canvas and exchanged
blows with Wengryn coming out
on top.

In the second fight, a game but
outclassed light-heavy, Hackswin-
der, lost to Bill Frick, a terrific
slugger. Frick won by a technical
knockout.

When Art Whalen, 113 and
Fisher, another 118 pounder, got
together, there was a whale of a
fight. Fisher whaled Whalen
around in the last round and won
the closest decision of the after-
noon.

TECHNICAL KAYOS

In the 155 pound class, Ku-
burnak and Kritzon slugged
around for three rounds with Ku-
burnak winning the verdict.

In another 155 pound bout,
John Miller defeated John Carrz
by a technical knockout.

George Ralph and Speigal, both

fastest bouts of the day. Speigal
won a unanimous decision.

Two more 125 pounders, Cohen
and Rosenberg, slugged it out for
three rounds. Cohen ﬁnished up
with a strong last round and
barely won.

145-POUN D SLUGGERS

In another 135 pound fight, lvlax
Zeman outclassed a hard swing-
ing southpaw, Morrison.

Trexel and Turner put on one
of the finest exhibitions in the
145 pound class. It was a slug-
fest with Turner slugging ahead.

All-Stars!

Panthers Accept

Added to the team of East-
ern football stars who will par-
ticipate in the annual All-East
versus All-West game in San
Francisco on New Year's Day
are Frank Souchak and John-
] ny Michelosen, Pitt stalwarts.

The team, of hand-selected
stars from the Eastern part of
the country, is under the di-
rection of Andy Kerr, former
Pitt coach and now head grid-
iron man at Colgate. -

Only seniors are eligible to
make the trip, which will start
about December 20. The play-
ers are picked up en route un-
til the entire team is assem-
bled in Chicago.

One other Pitt player, Tony
Matisi, was invited to accom-
pany the team, but for person-
al reasons, declined.

Wanta Letter?
Join Olson’s

Squad

“You don’t need any past ex-
perience to win a letter in track or
cross-country,” claims Coach Carl
Olson. He has proof, and each
year the proof piles up.

Exhibit A, B and C are Ed Spitz,
George Cook and ,Alex Leggin,
members of last yea_r’s team lost
by graduation, who won letters in
both track and cross-country.
None had drawn on a track shoe

in high school, and running under
Panther colors was their initial
competitive experience.

Book Covers Reason
Underlying Problems
Of Public Assistance‘

“Economic Backgrounds of the
Relief Problem,” a volume. by
Dr. J. P. Watson, assistant direc-
tor of the .Bureau of Business Re-
search, and professor of economic
research, has recently. been pub-
lished by the Banta Press. ‘

This volume is the ﬁfth of a
series of business monographs
written by members of the staﬁ
of the bureau. It contains 160
pages in which are 14 chapters of
material on the subject of unem-
ployment and relief. Throughout
the book are charts explaining
the data.

The primary aim of this study,
according to Dr. Watson, is to
analyze the economic reasons un-
derlying the relief problem and
the reasons why this problem
will not disappear with the re-
turn of “prosperity.”

Most of the statistical material
deals with Allegheny county. A
majority of the material deals
directly with the Pittsburgh dis-
trict, using it as representative
of national conditions.

Monthly estimates of the num-
ber unemployed for the period
from 1929 to 1936, also are given. 
In addition, there are estimates
of the time in human labor lost
during this period of unemploy-
ment, and a chapter outlining
facts on socialpolicy toward the ‘
relief problem. 1

Play Adolescent,
Critic Says

By RAY C. MacIN'I‘YR.E
“Ceiling Zero,” a
crashing melodrama by Frank
Wead about big-time aviation, pro-
duced by Pitt Players last night in
Stephen Foster Memorial audi-
torium, was, in this one man’s
opinion, more than worth its salt
as student efl’ort—at least from the
standpoint of production.
tation was dynamic, smooth and
well-acted t h r 0 u g h 0 u t , with
scarcely a trace of nervousness ob-
servable in any of the players.

GOOD ACTING

Top honors for acting can be
given no one, as performances
were uniformly good—-which fact
suggests a tribute to director Buell
Whitehill, a newcomer whose first
play was an example summum
bonum of integrated, synchronized
production.

But, regardless of performance,
“Ceiling Zero” will not appeal as
a play to many college people. Ex-
cept for frequent swearing and
some clever innuendo, it is largely
adolescent stuff; and I should be
inclinedto recommend an expur-
gated version especially for air-
minded children.

WELL DONE

I liked it, however—because it
was well—done, as I have more
than intimated already. Besides,
I was young once, and air-minded
too, and the effects have not yet
quite worn off.

But in more serious contempla-
tion, it does seem a shame to waste
such good college talent on a show
so devoid» of intellectual and eso-
teric emotional suggestion. “Ceil-
ing Zero” is-perhaps best classiﬁed
as social melodrama, The distinc-
tion between melodrama and
drama is the emphasis of the for-
meron external circumstances and
events for stimulation rather than
on character as moulded by en-
vironment.

_ gmore educated response.
smashing, ‘

course, depend upon the latter.

Perhaps then, the Players should
try producing for a change a
drama which would provoke a
If Pitt
Players’ budget is at fault, a larg-
er appropriation should be made.

EXCELLENT SET

Returning to the play, one fact
deserving mention is that techni-
cal director James Lindsay’s set
seemed ﬂawless. Entailing what
might be. termed a “corner angle”
of perspective, it did not give the
flatness of impression that so many
sets convey.

The following members of the
“Ceiling Zero” cast also deserve
commendation for a job well done:
Bernard Mayer, C39, as Buzz Gor-
don, operator; James Lalor, C40,
as Doc Wilson, Chief Mechanic;
Harold Shapiro, C41, as Shorty
Wright, mechanic; Dale Claypool,
C41, as Les Bogan, metereologist;
and John Withum, BA38, as Jake
Lee, superintendent.

War, Exploration Don’ t M
Says Roy Chapman. Andrews,
Gobi Desert Explorer

By. ROBERT ADAMS

Politics and exploration don’t

And until the Chinese war is
ended and the countryrestored to
some... semblance of order, there
will be no more scientific expe-
ditions in Mongolia.

So declared Roy—Chapman An-
drews, explorer and scientist; and
director ofthe American Museum
of Natural History, in an inter-
view before his, lecture yesterday
at the University assembly in
Syria Mosque.

ASIA: CHAOTIC

, “All of-- eastern~Asia is in a_
state of chaos now,” said Dr. An-
drews. “Japan will certainlytake.
Nanking, even though the Chi-
nese have 300,000 men defending,
it, but then Japan’s t1j0(1b).'.8S.Wi-l1_
have just begun. The. Chinese
may be able to, keep up a. 
warfare. for years, and until the
situation is cleared ;up, an expe-
dition is outof the question.

“When I was over there in the
summer of, 1936, I talked to the
Mongolchiefs, and; I realized that
this affair was coming. Of‘; course,
.1_,h_aye_._ no idea, when orzhow the
fighting will, end. Soldiers and

ba.ndits—in- Mongolia, the, words,
are synonymous-—-are very active.

now, and life in Peking, under
the Japanese influence,,is prac-
tically regimented.”
CAMELS STOLEN

Describ,ing. the u dif‘r‘ic'_ulti_es,- of
leading an expedition in bandit-
infested. country, Dr. 
told howhis caravan of 150 cam-
els was stolen by vbandits, When
he found out that the bandit chief
who had made the raid was a
friend of his, D_r. Andrews vis-
ited him, and securedthe return
of the camels with this exclama-
tion from the chief--“If I- had
known they were your camels, I
wouldn’t- have taken them."

Weather conditions in Mongolia
vary greatly, with the tempera-
ture going as high as 140 degrees
and aslow as 50 below, said Dr.
Andrews. But Mongolian cold is
easier to endure than Pittsburgh
cold, he thinks, because the air
on the Gobi Desert is very dry.

DUNE DWELLERS

“It is very likely that central
Asia was the center of distribu-
tion of much of the world’s. life
today. Remains of the dune
dwellers, which we found in Mon-
golia, are much like those of a
people who lived in Alaska. We
have yet to discover what their
relationship to other peoples was,
though,” said Dr. Andrews.

The Gobi Desert is I essentially
a rock desert, with only small
areas of sand, he explained. In

his lecture, he showed motion pic-
tures, and slides of desert scenes,
depicting the rocky roads, mud
holes, and great canyons formed
by.-land» erosion. Among. thetbest
scenes were movies of the camel
caravan crossing sand dunes in
the moonlight. _
 Andrews described-,th.e. 
covery» of : the-_~d.in.o$aur eggs. and
of some of . the fossils of.preh;is-
