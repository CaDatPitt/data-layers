Properly management helps ﬁnd living room

 

Searching for off-campus housing
and ﬁnding a landlord that won’t rip stu-
dents off doesn’t have to be as hard as it
used to be, according to Pitt property

ers.

Ken O’Shauglmessy, director of the
Oﬁice of Property Management, said

- ﬁnding a home outside the dorms does-

n’t have to be as frustrating as it once
was.

Property management not only rents
out Pitt-owned apartments, but also
screens outside landlords, helps students
ﬁnd roommates for their present apart-
ments, and locates subletters to take over
current leases.

V If students have questions before
signing a lease, they can take the lease to
property management, where advisers
will explain what it means in terms stu-

dents can understand.
Property management also
has its own web page

(httpJ/www.pitt.edu/~property/pm.html)
listing currently inspected landlords, stu-
dents looking for subletters, and
University-owned apartment buildings.
With this web page, out-of—town stu-
dents can communicate with landlords
from a remote area. They don't have to
be in the office to find the information
they need.

student goes into the office looking for a
landlord, property management will
provide them with a list of landlords
who have been inspected by the
Pittsburgh Bureau of the Building
Inspection Department.

What this means is that all of the
landlords or real estate agents property
management keep on ﬁle have been
inspected by BBI and that their units are
up to a liveable standard.

“[Property management] are only
accepting listings from inspected land-
lords. A landlord’s building must be safe
for students to live in,” said
O’Shaughnessy. “I want to be able to go
home at night, put my head on a pillow,
and know that I am not responsible for
sending a student to an apartment which
may cause them bodily harm.”

As it stands, landlords and real
estate agents are under a voluntary
inspection policy. They don't have to be
inspected. However, if a landlord wishes
to be inspected, they have to fill out an
application with the BB1 and pay an
application fee of $10 per unit to be
inspected.

O’Shaughnessy said he wants the
voluntary inspection to be a mandatory
one. This way, he said, students will
know that no matter where they go, the
apartment they choose has been deemed
liveable by professionals who know
what to look for.

The standards of liveability, accord-
ing to O’Shaughnessy, include reason-

Neighbors recall details
about minister's murder

The investigation into the murder
of Sam Brunsvold, campus minister at
Pitt and Carnegie Mellon University,
continues as neighbors try to recollect
facts from that night to help find the
killer.

Brunsvold, 36, was gunned down
Jan. 28 in what appeared to be a drive-
by shooting. After hearing a gunshot
that night, one person saw‘a car drive
away. .

“I was up in my apartment watch-
ing TV, heard what I thought was a
gunshot, went to my window, and
looked out and saw tail lights of this
car going through the stop sign. [It]
did not stop,” said Jim Devaney.

Devaney recalled that at 10:15
p.m., a car sped through the stop sign.

“I knew [the sound] was not a car

 

backﬁring and looked at the clock. At
10:14, there was one gunshot. Exactly
at 10:15 p.m., I heard a car acceler-
ate,” said Devaney. “Especially at
night, there is not much noise. I knew
it was a car and not a truck.”

Devaney lives on the third ﬂoor,
but was unable to see out the window
and identify the car’s make and
license number as it ﬂed the murder
scene. Moments later, he rushed out-
side and saw a crowd gathering near
the left side of his apartment.

“I saw people across the street
[from the crime scene] and walked
through the comer. ‘Have you called
911?’ I asked,” Devaney said.

Others had a similar recollections
of that night, but some remembered
hearing Brunsvold engaged in a con-
versation with someone before the
murder.

Nearing end of Marriott deal,
some want to keep status quo

._Zc_i_cl1arialr Blott

= '  ga=*.»;«*«'.:»:::»:'-'-==:e.*-: 
 .... ..,- .......... 

Time is about to run out for
Marriott on campus.

Marriott’s contract is set to expire
this summer, at the end of the fiscal
year. The race for the honor to feed Pitt
students next year is on.

While there is no clear winner yet,
some think it would be best to stay with
the status quo.

Both Director of Food Services
Betsy Sallade-Farina, who works for
Pitt, and Schenley Cafe Food
Production Supervisor Leroy Divelbiss,
who works for Marriott, said that
Marriott offers students decent meal
options for fair prices.

“They offer a decent product for a
decent price,” said Divelbiss. “The por-
tions are also good.”

Sallade-Farina acknowledged that
students complain about the fact that

  

they spend around $5 for a block worth
only $4.50 at retail eateries, but says
that the students are not being cheated.

“If we were to go dollar for dollar,
the students would have to pay signiﬁ-
cantly more at the all-you-can—eat cafe-
terias,” said Sa1lade—Farina. “Also, this
system lets the parents know that we’re
encouraging their kids to eat right and
get the healthy block specials that are
all worth more than $5.”

Sallade-Farina says that the largest
recommendation/complaint from stu-
dents, though, is the desire for a change
in the block system to allow meals to be
purchased that are worth less than $4.50
without spending an entire block. She
said this recommendation led to next
year’s implementation of the Dining
Dollars.

Student’s have also questioned why
Schenley Cafe closes half of its vendors

THE PITT NEWS 3

Freshman survey aims at
improving University life

3.. . ’.’.‘C"_.:::.":";:'.CV:::::"$"'.:::'C'3':':°:;

 
 
  

   

Jean ,M°".° 1°‘

The administration has a new
strategy for improving Pitt — just
ask the freshmen.

The provost’s office has devised
a two-step program of surveys and
discussion groups to use students’
insight, particularly that of fresh-
men, to improve the University’s
services.

“We are starting fresh with the
freshmen so we can follow them
up,” said Dr. Scott Beach of the
University Center for Socialization
and Urban Research (UCSUR).

In the first step of the plan, the
provost’s office has ordereda stu-
dent survey by the UCSUR. The
center has randomly chosen 1,200
freshmen to "be interviewed by
phone about their satisfaction with
Pitt so far.

Jack Daniel,
vice provost of aca-
demic affairs, said
he did not want to
reveal the exact for-
mat of the survey
questions but did
say they touch on
such aspects of stu-
dent life as acade-
mics, advising, res-
idence halls, dining
facilities, safety,
transportation, diversity, and many
others. ~

The UCSUR plans to notify stu-
dents of their selection for partici-
pation in the survey by mail. The
survey will be conducted in three
waves of 400 students at a time.

Beachsaid the first wave of let-
ters is already out and the inter-
views already conducted have gone
well. Contacting students by phone
takesless time and makes getting a
response easier.

The UCSUR chose a telephone
format because a good response is
necessary for the survey to succeed.
Beach said that when surveys are
mailed, only about 20 percent of
students return the questionnaires.

The provost’s office has never
conducted such an in-depth survey
of freshmen, but other recent input
from students has led to improve-
ments in the University’s services.
Daniel cited the shorter lines at reg-
istration and the new electronic
processing of loans as examples of
improvements made in response to
student input.

Since improving the Pitt experi-
ence might not be incentive enough,

 

students participating in the survey
will be eligible to win a $500 gift
certificate from the University
Book Center.

Daniel said students’ participa-
tion in the survey is essential
because the survey is designed to
enhance their experience at the
University.

This survey has long-term goals
for improving University life.

“In the midst of academic plan-_

ning, one of the ways in which we
want to reposition the University is
to make sure we are known to have
one of the highest-quality under-
graduate programs,” Daniel said.‘
According to Daniel, the
provost’s office intends to consult
with other areas of the University
based on the survey’s findings to
identify and maintain areas of
strength as well as improve the

tions is whether or
not the students
will be back next
year.

“We are ulti-
mately interested
in keeping students
here,” he said.

In part two of
the plan, Daniel

expects to use issues raised by the -

survey for discussion in focus
groups of about 20 students who
will address specific topics in
greater depth.

To better determine the needs of
all University students, the
provost’s office plans to relate the
results of the survey and discus-
sions to the profiles that the fresh-
men completed at the beginning of
the academic year and also to sur-
veys of upperclassmen.

“We will continue to check with
the students as sophomores,
juniors, and seniors,” Daniel said.
They also plan to survey the new
group of freshmen next year.

Daniel said that he expects the
results to come out some time in
April and that they will be made
accessible to the people who pro-
vide the services that students men-
tion.

The UCSUR designed the sur-
vey and is in charge of conducting
the telephone interviews. Beach
said the center has conducted stu-
dent surveys in the past, but never
one with such far-reaching implica-
tions.

Ricci said it was not a robbery
because nothing seemed to be missing
when the police arrived.
“He had his hands in his pockets.
He wasn’t robbed because he had his

book bag and keys to his car,” said’

Ricci.

The neighbors did not really take
the sound seriously in the beginning.

“Most people reacted the same way.
Nothing ever happens around here.
Went on with their business. Nobody
realized it was a gunshot,” said Ricci.

As neighbors try to recall any
details of that night, the police from the
homicide division of the East Liberty
Bureau of Investigations continue to
investigate the murder.

“It’s difficult to quantify the inves-
tigation,” said Commander Ronald
Freeman, head of the investigation.
“We are full-thrust. after the case. We
are not up against a stone wall, moving
forward and making progress. We are
not at a pace we want to be.” p

Freeman had all his officers work-
ing on this case when it happened, but
even as other cases have come up, there
are still 18 officers working on this case
including himself.

“We don’t have any results to share
with the public at this time, but we are
optimistic about solving this case,” said
Freeman.

There is a $7,500 reward for any
information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the suspect. Four thou-
sand comes from three anonymous
donors, crime stoppers have offered
$2,000, City Council President Jim
Ferlo has offered $500, and the
Highland Park Association has offered
$1,000.

At a news conference, Sherri
Brunsvold asked the people of
Pittsburgh for help.

“If there is anyone out there who
has any information, who knows any-
thing about this, please come forward.
The children and I deserve that. And
you need to do that for us,” she said.

“Some people have been renting

20 years without having ﬁre exits,” he

because a landlord isn’t listed with prop-

there are many realtors and landlords who

quality apartments. These landlords sim-
ply choose not to list through property
management.

Some realtors with apartments close
to the University who do not choose to
list through the service include Glickman

South Oakland), and
McKinney/Ringham Realty (The

But, O’Shaughnessy said, a student
will pay for the luxury of living in such
apartments. Two bedrooms at all three
locations generally run higher than $700,

which can seem a lot of money for two
students to pay. However, Glickman pro-
vides full furnishings in their units.

“I don’t mean to say that landlords
who don’t list with us are bad landlords.
But if a landlord wants our referrals, they
have to get inspected,” said
O’Shaughnessy. “In fact, a lot of land-
lords have properties that will pass
inspection, but they are skittish about the
whole inspection process and fear what
they don’t know, which is if they will pass
inspection or not.”

The Office of Property Management
doesn’t just dictate the standard by which
University area landlords must operate.
According to O’Shaughnessy, they prac-
tice what they preach.

“We have to hold ourselves to the
same standards we ask of other land-
lords,” said O’Shaughnessy, noting that
they just sent in the check for each of their
units to be inspected.

Each year, the Pitt Program Council
sponsors an apartment hunting fair. This
year, any landlord was allowed to attend
and advertise their properties.
O’Shaughnessy said that future housing
fairs will be limited to inspected land-
lords.

A crowded lifestyle

Because there are more students
seeking olf-campus housing than there
are places to live, students will sometimes
rent a place that is too small for the num-
ber of people who live there.

O’Shaughnessy said this happens
due to the cost of living.

“The cost [of off—campus apartments]

. may cause students to accept bad condi-

tions because with ﬁve or six students liv-
ing in one place, the rent is cheap and
affordable,” he said. “A lot of students
tolerate horrible conditions because of
this, which all goes back to my point of
having mandatory inspections for land-
lords.”

The problem with having four or
more students living in one place is that it
violates housing codes. The code states
that no more than three unrelated occu-
pants may inhabit one apartment or

house. Theoretically, if four unrelated

people sign a lease, the lease was signed
unlawfully. O’Shauglmessy claims this
code is violated all the time.

Property management will not
encourage more than three students to go
to a unit, even if there is ample size,
because of this code. They also won’t

sign a lease for University-owned apart-
ment with more than three students.

Dealing with untimely repairs
O’Shaughnessy encouraged students
who are living in uninhabitable condi-
tions to inform their landlord in writing of
the problems with their apartment. Once
a “reasonable” amount of time has
passed, if the landlord has not repaired
the conditions, O’Shaughnessy stressed
the need for students to call outside orga-

nizations for help to get the problems

ﬁxed, repaired, or dealt with.

These numbers include the
Allegheny County Health Department at
687-2243, the Bureau of Building
Inspection at 255-6700, Housing
Counseling Services at 227-4804,
Neighborhood Legal Services at 255-
6700, and Legal Information for
Undergraduates at 648-7970.

Applications, for University-owned
apartments, listings for inspected land-
lords, and listings for subletters can be
picked up in the Office of Property
Management, located behind Sorrento’s
Pizza on Atwood Street. Students can
also call property management at 683-
1460..

“Most colleges close their cafeterias
at 6:30 p.m.” Sallade-Farina said. “We
stay open but we don’t have enough stu-
dent interest to utilize all of the vendors.
Also, we’ll try to rotate which stores are
Jpen after 8 p.m.”

“I try to keep a block special up for
students who have late classes and they
can always get a burger, fries, and a soda
for under a block,” Divelbiss said.

Sallade-Farina also discussed the
request for vegetarian entrees. University
Food Services worked with Marriott and
vegetarians to create solutions. As a
result, a line in the C-Side Cafeteria was
dedicated to vegetarian foods including
garden burgers, pinto beans, and sweet
potatoes.

She also said that Food Services lis-
tens to students’ suggestions for vegetari-
an options.

“The potato bar in Eddie’s was a stu-
dent’s suggestion,” said Sallade-Farina.
“We also have a vegetarian healthy block
special everyday.”

Divelbiss likewise said that he listens
to students’ suggestions or complaints.

‘Tlhe students’ ideas] have to be
taken seriously,” he said. “Any comment,
compliment, or complaint is listened to.”

According to Divelbiss, students
have complained about employees or
how crowded the cafe can become, and
he can understand these concerns. If a
student ﬁnds Schenley Cafe crowded, he
recommends they come during the off

hours.

Sallade-Farina said that reports about
employees with bad attitudes are greatly
exaggerated.

“My office gets more compliments
than complaints about the workers,” she
said.

Sallade-Farina encourages students
to voice their opinions by either filling
out a comment card at any of the eateries
or coming to her ofﬁce. She said that she
maintains an open-door policy. Her office
is located through the red doors at the top
of the C-Side Cafeteria steps.

“We’ve taken students’ ideas and
proposed them_ to the bidders,” Sallade-
Farina said. “We’re here to listen to the
students and make changes accordingly.”

Food service contracts last ﬁve to 10
years. Marriotl’s current contract was
signed ﬁve years ago, based on their rep-
resentation at other large universities,
their quality at sirnilarly-sized universi-
ties, and the locality of a district manag-
er.

This year, approximately 10 compa-
nies are vying with Marriott for the con-
tract, including such large food service
providers as Aramark, Park Hurst (who

owns Eat N’ Park), and Sadexho.‘

Companies receive a set fee for providing
food services to the University and incen-
tives based on quality performance.

Tomorrow: students’ and SGB’s
thoughts about Marriott and food ser-
vices.

This project has been shown to audiences all over the world.

Stress at work: how to deal with it and not kill anyone

 

A history professor once told
me that, rather than working and
going to college at the same time,
students should just take out loans
and focus on their studies. For
those of us who understand how
impossible that is, being at work all
the time is a fact of life. VVrth that in
mind, and ﬁnals knocking at the
door, now is deﬁnitely the time to
start thinking about how to relieve
workplace stress.

Unless, of course, you’ve
already gone postal on that annoy-
ing coworker ’s ass.

Since I have, so far, managed
to restrain myself from committing
mass murder by planting a small,
but effective, bomb in a drawer in
one of the cubicles in our oﬂice, I
think this qualiﬁes me to give some
advice about how to reduce stress
without too much violence.

Now, I understand that not
many people work in a situation
where they can suddenly jump up,
grab a pair of 20-inch-long wooden
sticks, pound whoever bugs them
into a bloody pulp, and call it
something bourgeois like “arnis.”
Not everyone has the pleasure of
walking calmly to her coworker’s
cubicle and politely explaining, for
the 18th time, why he doesn’t have
the slightest clue what he’s talking
about. Not everyone can yell at her
boss and beat her ﬁsts against a pil-
lar trying to get his attention
(although it causes even more
workplace stress when this ﬁustrat-
ed attempt fails to get his attention).

Everyone can, however.
remember to eat lunch outside the
oﬂice. Iknow tint the temptation to

work through meals and get done
sooner is hard to resist, but believe
me, after so many times, you begin
to spend more time plotting anoth-
er worker's demise than writing
your news articles. There are only
so many times you can think about
who in your oﬂice you’d shoot if
you only had a six-shot revolver.
Remember to take some time

  ini rce stress.

 

to eat without a coworker, or else
you’ll end up conspiring about who
the two of you would introduce to
the barrel of Uncle Bob’s shiny
new toy.

Keeping that in mind and get-
ting back to my point, there are, in
fact, healthy ways to relieve work-

place stress. When your place of
employment has those long,

tedious holiday and end-of—the-
year ﬁmctions, go. The food is free,
what have you got to lose? Get all
gussied up — a dress and heels, a
jacket and tie, whatever — just
don’t wear those ratty jeans with all
theholesinthemthataretwosizes
too small. Then ask all your
coworkers to go, too.

If they have other plans, don’t
threaten them or their pets, just
annoy them until they threaten you.
Then make them feel so guilty that
they decide to go.

Remind yourself that there is
more to work than work itself.
Think of stupid little things you can
change in the capacity of your job
that most people won’t notice.
Point out what you did to the peo-
ple you like; make it a goofy inside
joke. You’d be amazed by how
much joy you can inject into your
dingy cubicle-based life by modi-
fying something simple.

Change another person’s
screensaver. Quotes are nice.

' Messages about how the two of

you should put your heads together
and eliminate the urmamed source
of your stress are probably
unhealthy. They put a smile on
your face, but well, I can’t really
advocate things like luring people
to deserted dockside warehouses
and taking care not to leave any
evidence behind It’s not like I
would even consider anything like
that. Ilm not Keyser Soze.

_ More to the point, minor
changes and inside jokes are a
good thing. Laughing is very
important. So, when someone
decides to do their best Mark
Nordenberg impression, complete
with the measured contemplative
pause and Midwestern nasal drawl,

sit ‘ k for a few minutes and
enjo ,it.

Don’tbe afraid to read The Pitt
News at work, no matter what your
boss says. Draft a letter to the edi-
tor with some coworkers lambast-
ing an opinion you don’t agree
with, syrnpathizing with a witty
sports column, or expressing con-
cern about something on campus
like, say, the food Or what about
fan mail? Tell your favorite writer
how much you like her work

The other really important
thing to point out is how to recog-
nize the need to reduce workplace
stress. It may sound odd, but some-
times things have just been a cer-
tain way for so long that people
may not realize that it’s ﬁxable.

When your boss starts beating
on Skittles with a hammer — or
better yet, attempting to balance a
Skittle on the head of one his
dear ﬁiends in order to s it
withaharnrner—thereistoo
much stress in your workplace.

When you wander around
your office barefoot, wearing a
tank top in, say, January, plotting
ways to requisition a University
vehicle and head for sorrre place
warm, you’ve been under too
much pressure.

Of course, it could just nrean
that you’re a bit neurotic and that
your boss is a psycho.

But if you can get beyond the
stress and learn to cope with work,
you can learn more in the oﬁice
than you can in the classroom
Working is really much more
rewarding if you manage not to kill
anyone in the process. Honest.

»Cesca Antonelli has a low-
paying, high-stress job, but most
days she kind of likes it anyway.

l.l. ABOARD!

  p.r. raylor buys a
ticket to ride on
Europe's high -speed
train of the future

I just got more time to spend with the

people I am visiting on my trips home to

England. My brother, who is employed by a
U.S. multinational corporation, and his farm-

ly now live in Brussels. 1, thus, barely had’

time to get over my Pittsburgh—to—London jet
lag when I and a friend found ourselves up at
the crack of dawn and heading from Penge, a
low—lying area in the southern outskirts of the
city, to the hustle and bustle of “real” London.
We passed the Houses of Parliament,
Westminster Abbey, and, of course, that

_famous London landmark, St. Thomas’

Hospital, where I was born.

I was excited about the trip and looking
forward to experiencing the latest in modern
luxury travel — the high—speed train which
links London’s Waterloo Station with
Brussels Midi in Belgium In fact, my brother
and his family live in Waterloo, so our actual
journey was from Waterloo, England, to

' Waterloo, Belgium, all in all giving the whole

affair a nice circuitous feel. -

Waterloo Station in London is one of th
major train stations in the city. Boasting a
towering Victorian facade rising out of the
typical London mix of modern concrete with
ancient stone, the station was completed in the
last century and has transported passengers
from the noise and chaos of the city to the
peace and greenery of the Kent countryside
for over 100 years.

While the facade of Waterloo Station still
looks much as it did when horse—drawn taxis
pulled up and steam trains transported pas-
sengers, the inside has been transformed into
a typical, high—tech modern station. In 1994, a
major new glass and steel addition was
opened by Queen Elizabeth II and French
President Francois Mitterrand This newest
addition to the terminal is named Waterloo
International and is the London home of the
Eurostar high—speed train service which links
England with France and Belgium.
Passengers board the train in London and
arrive in Paris or Brussels about three hours
later.

When I was growing up, seeking the sun
in the south of France or Italy from the mists
of London always meant a ferry boat We
would drive or take the train to Dover, hop on
theferry, and watch the white cliffs of Dover
slowly recede across the sea until reaching
Calais, and then it was time to say “merci”
instead of “thank you."

The water separating England and
France is only 21 miles across at its narrowest
point, and is called the English Channel by the
English. (Guess what the French call it —- no,
Le Manche.) It was nearly 200 years ago that
the idea of an undersea link was proposed, but
minor details like being at war with France, let

alone technical difficulties, meant that the
project would take‘ some time to come to
fruition. On December 1, 1990, a British and
a French engineer shook hands in a dusty pit
some200feetbelowtheseabed,andGreat
Britain ceased to be an island for the ﬁrst time
since the Ice Age.

In America, Clinton is building a bridge
to the 21st century, but in Europe, they built a
tunnel instead It runs from Shakespeare Cliff
in England to Sangatte in France, partly
because the channel is at its narrowest point
here, and also because there is a layer of chalk
man which runs almost the whole way across.
Marl is a mixture of chalk and clay, soft and
easy to tunnel through. Although more or less
waterproof, it is also strong enough not to col-
lapse when holes are bored through it. An
extremely good omen for the “chunnel”
occurred when engineers started work in 1987
at Shakespeare Cliff and found the remains of
a tunnel, started a century before, still dry and

in good condition, despite never having been '

lined. —

During the tunnel’s construction, eight-
hour shifts of up to 1,000 people were trans-
ported into the tunnel on a construction rail-
way. Huge tunnel—boring machines were cus-
tom built from tungsten carbide. These cut
through the chalk marl at a rate of 62 miles a
month by using laser beams to keep them on
course. Conveyor belts carried the “spoil”
(2,400 tons an hour) out of the tumrel. In fact,
the design speciﬁcations called for three
linked tirmrels, not unlike the Fort
Pitt Tunnel -—- one in, one out,
and one service tunnel in
the middle.

The decision to run the trains nonstop
through three countries (there is not much
point in traveling at three miles a minute if
you have to stop for a 10-minute crew
changeover) meant creating new grades of
railway personnel. Eurostar is a complex
machine operating within four different rail
and electrical systems in three different coun-
tries. Therefore, a new “lntemational Driver”
grade was created by British Rail. About 400
people applied to be drivers and took aptitude
tests measuring their powers of coordination,
concentration, and reaction times. Twenty-
four drivers made it through to the 15-month
training program, which includes psychologi-
cal and pyschornetric testing; language acqui-
sition, which included living “en farnille” in
France; and using “train simulator” computer-
ized training like that given to airline pilots.
Finally,‘ the drivers got to drive the Eurostar
trains through England, France, and Belgium
during the thousands of miles of test runs that
every Eurostar train was subjected to.

seats complete with table, reading lamp, and

“Eurostar Magazine,” which details events of
interest that month in all three countries, we
listened to the chatter of many languages
going on around us.

The train pulled out exactly on time, so
quiet and smooth we could barely notice we
were moving. The streets of London fell away
from the windows, gray city blocks changing
with those funny sneak peeks into peoples’
lives (laundry, gardens, kitchen windows) into
the suburban brick houses with long, thin gar-
dens stretching down to the railway lines. We
picked up speed as we left even those behind
and moved into the open countryside, heading
for the coast. The land became ﬂatter toward
the sea, and the cows and sheep started
hurtling past at a speed which was too fast to
focus on the names of the stations we sped
through. The ride was still so smooth and
quiet that the smoke from the Gauloises hung
in the bar car in ribbons, and the wine in my
glass didn’t even ripple.

The tunnel comes upon you as a surprise;
you don’t even see the sea, but suddenly the
View is gone. About 20 minutes later, the view
returns, and the driver announces (now ﬁrst in
French, of course) that the train is now travel-
ing at a speed of 168 kilometers an hour.
Fields, trees, cows, farmhouses, villages -—— if
they are far enough away from the train, you
can see them —— but don’t try to focus on any-
thing close by. You can’t, it’s just a blur. The
sun started setting as we crossed from France
into Belgium, and we sat and drank our wine
and watched the sky change the scenery from

‘ green to beige to pink to gray to navy blue,

and by that time we felt the train slowing. The
driver announced (in Flemish ﬁrst) that we
had arrived at Brussels Midi. He then thanked
us for choosing Eurostar and said he hoped to
be of service again, and wished us good
evening. We stepped off the train, showed our
passports, and were in the heart of Brussels,
smelling a good smell of waﬁles cooking and
hearing a cacophony of languages. As I
bumped into somebody, I found myself auto
rnatically saying “pardon!” instead of “sorry”
and kissing my brother hello on both cheeks
with a, well, European level of enthusiasm

It is silly to fear the influence of corporate Japan

 

A few days ago, I was
searching in my Time maga-
zine CD-ROM researching
information for a class of
mine when I came across an
article from March, 1992,
about how presidential can-

didates that year were
attempting to bash Japan for
its supposed economic supe-
riority over the United States
as a way of elevating their
ﬂailing Presidential cam-
paigns. Remember when the
Japanese scared the you-
know-what out of us?

They seemed to be every-
where, buying up real estate,
golf courses, and computer
businesses.‘ They even had
the audacity to try to buy an
American baseball team!
American workers were
being put out of work, and
newspapers and magazines
ominously talked about how
the Red Sun of Japan was ris-
ing once again, threatening
our future. A little-known
economist named Pat Choate
caused a stir in Washington
circles by writing a book
(Agents of Inﬂuence) that
darkly detailed in conspirato-
rial terms more suited for the
X-Files instead of a serious
policy debate, how the

Japanese recruited govern-
mental officials to work for
their corporations. We
Americans, the pundits
warned darkly, would have to
become more competitive in
order to compete with the
nefarious Japanese if we are
to survive.

Guess what: they were
wrong! Today the United
States holds all of the cards.

and Japan are growing much

ing in fewer imports.”
Stanford economist Paul
Krugman wrote an article a
few weeks ago for USA
Today ridiculing all of the
people who thought that the
Japanese were out to conquer
the world. To prove his point
that the Japanese were not
; invincible, he
 recounted a

record in the   tour he had

years sinceé §Japan’s

Since 1992,   up as the
America’s  ‘ organization

economy has grown five
times as fast as Japan’s stag-
nating economy. Recently
their stock market dropped
dramatically, sending
Japanese businessmen into a
panic. Even our persistent
trade gap with the Japanese,
a well-cited statistic by those
afraid of the Japanese, is not
as bad as everyone thinks.
Deputy Secretary of the
Treasury Lawrence Summers
noted recently: “In some
ways, the trade deficit is a
measure of our strength. We
are growing, that means

the central Japanese govern-
ment used to control private
enterprise. On his tour
Krugman saw that: “What
the Ministry of Finance

looked like was,’ well,
Boston’s Department of
Motor Vehicles. Staffers

wandered around in their
socks, gossiping or smoking,
while their desks were
heaped high with disorderly
stacks of yellowing paper.”
This is the nerve center of
the juggernaut whose mis-
sion is the total domination
of the world economy? I

fight

don’t think so.

For all of the sinister talk
about the Japanese creed that
“Business is War” and about
how Japan, Inc. has become
a massive economic power-
house, the fact is that Japan’s
corporate generals are not
competent leaders.
Historically, military sys-
tems with little vision or cre-
ativity have always tended to
the last war even
though the situation present-
ing them has changed dra-

matically. For example, the

French thought that World
War II. would be fought
exactly the way World War I
had been fought: a defensive
war in the trenches. They
failed to appreciate the
advantages offensive
weaponry like tanks and air-
planes gave the German
army. As a result they lost
because they lacked the abil-
ity to adapt to a radically dif-
ferent situation. In much the
same way, the Japanese
bureaucracy still "thinks that
it is fighting the wars of the
1980s, when they were able
to scarf up devalued
American assets. .

Anyone who seriously
thinks that the Japanese pose
a threat to the United States,
and we should respond by
raising tariff barriers to

Japanese goods is naive.
Instead of the Japanese, we
ought to be wary of the rise
of China. With three million
troops, over 5,000 combat
aircraft and more than 300
nuclear warheads, the
Chinese are a significant mil-
itary power right now and
their economy, thanks to
government deregulation, is
growing each day. With
China becoming increasingly

determined to assert itself in’

the Pacific region, it is per-
haps inevitable that ‘the
United States and China will
begin to bump heads in the
not—so-distant future.

John Hay, Secretary of
State from 1898-1905, wise-
ly noted in that “[t]he
Mediterranean is the ocean
of the past; the Atlantic, the
ocean of the present; the

Pacific, the ocean of the»

future.” Japan is our largest
trading partner in Asia, a"
region that accounts for 30
percent of America’s exports
and a region that will only
grow in importance for us in
the future. We would be fools
to actually believe that
attacking Japan would do
anythingbut harm us in the
long run. V ‘
Michael Berquist thinks that
Japan-bashers should wise

up.

aware the students are at a high risk waiting
for a chance to cross, and are delayed in
getting to classes or to their residences.
'Iheir safety and their concerns should have
priority over business establishments.

Am I sounding too simplistic with the
idea of the construction of a couple of ele-

access between the Cathedral of Learning
and the William Pitt Union? Wouldn’t one
think the construction costs would equal
those of narrowing the street and planting
trees and shrubs? How is the latter going to
eliminate risks and frustrations?

Sure, we like
grass, but this
is a bit ‘too little

I am a big fan of grass, but come
on, 30 feet? If you are going to give us
grass, I want enough to do something
on it. What am I going to do, sit and
watch the cars drive by? I can do that
on any part of the campus. I appreciate
the effort, but this Bigelow stuff is a
dead-end situation. Why is Pitt going
to throw away $500,000 -$750,000 on

a piece of land that is not really bene-
ﬁcial? I’d like to be able to get a free
bus ride downtown with that money,
or more computers, or just whatever.
But for 30 feet of grass? That’s a big
price tag. Would you pay $500,000 for
30 feet of sod? I think that’s an appro-
priate question we should ask our-

selves.

Kevin Willard is
an asset to

Pitt basketball

This letter is in response to the col-
umn written by Sports Editor Matt
Grove, entitled “Daddy Dearest: The
Kevin Willard Story.”

As a Pitt student, employee, and an
avid Panther sports fan, I am outraged by

 
     

the personal attacks on one of our finest
basketball players and his family. Kevin
Vlfrllard has made countless contributions
to our winning season and is not only an
integral part of the team, but also an out-
standing Division I athlete.

Kevin's admirable work ethic,
exceptional skills, positive attitude, and
Pitt pride are exempliﬁed every time he
steps on the court. There‘ is no question
that Kevin Willard deserves to be on our
Pitt basketball team and a member of the
starting line-up. I agree that “he brings
spirit and hustle to the team and con-
tributes things that don’t show up on the
stat sheet.”

Our student athletes put an immense
amount of energy and time into being the
best. We all can be proud when those
blue and gold uniforms represent the
University of Pittsburgh in competitions
all over the United States! ‘

Panthers start conference season with win

Office pools
make great
paper airplanes

 

It’s Wednesday. All significant post-
season tournament action will be on hold
until tomorrow evening.

Time for a little self-affirmation.
Drop your Southeast region bracket, find
the nearest mirror, and repeat this mantra:
I am still a good sports fan even though
my NCAA championship pool is now an
ofﬁcialfederal disaster area.

Sure, in every office, there’s’ some-
body that has nailed every upset, called
every 8-9 rnatchup successfully, and now
looks like a genius. Of course, usually it’s
the person who’s never seen a basketball
game in his life, filled out the pool in ﬁve
minutes, and couldn't tell Dick Vitale
from Dick Clark on a bet.

Maybe he picks Tennessee-
Chattanooga because he likes trains.
Maybe he takes Coppin State because
he’s uncomfortable cheering for any
squad called the Gamecocks. Maybe the
selection process involves coin ﬂips,
magic crystals, or the Psychic Friends
Network.

Whatever it is, it works. Sports fans
hate these people.

I speak from experience. I haven’t
filled out an office For-Entertainment
Purposes-Only document since I lost a
football pool three years ago. The winner
was the sales executive’s 6-year-old
daughter. I think she picked the teams
with the pretty uniforms.

Talk about an ego destroyer. And now
that 48 teams have been eliminated,
chances are there are many other sports
egos that have taken a hit.

If you aren’t one of these people,
you’ve seen them. While the dorm room,
bar, or frat house was screaming for a
Coppin State upset, the die-hard NCAA
fan was in the corner there, ripping up his
pro-Gamecock toumament bracket.

Now, it’s time for the healing process:

Evay season in every sport, teams
begin their conference schedules with the
same undefeated record. Whether a team
is 20-0 or 0-20 in its nonconference
games, everybody starts off with a clean
slate and the idea of winning the confer-
ence championship. The Pitt women’s
tennis team had this in mind Sunday
when they defeated Big East rival
Connecticut 6-1 in their ﬁrst conference
match.

“Our tearri was very up for this
match. Fran and myself remember what
it was like to lose to them at last year's
Big East Toumament,” senior captain
Tamara Kalesnik said, referring to the 4-
2 loss that eliminated Pitt from the tour-
nament.

Head Coach George Dieffenbach
was noticeably delighted with his team’s
performance against the rival Huskies.

‘The ease of our victory surprised
me,” he said. “The combination of our

Lacrosse clinches spot
in playoffs with ll-9
win over Grove City

 

 '

Freshman Ed Murphy helped lift the
Pitt men’s lacrosse team to a victory over
Grove City last night in a game the
Panthers were calling their game of the
year.

Murphy was the difference in the
contest, netting a hat trick in the 11-9
win

 

‘This is a huge win for this team,”
Murphy said. ‘This was.tlie game of the
season for us. We played them back in
the fall and they beat us pretty good.
Tonight was sweet revenge.”

More importantly, the victory
clinches a spot in the playoffs, a step the
Panthers did not reach last year.

“The victory basically gives us
home field advantage,” Murphy said.
“Nobody can beat us at home.”

“We will probably play Ohio
University here in the first round. We are
looking forward to playing them again,”
Head Coach Gary Neﬁ said.

The Panthers almost blew their shot
at revenge against the Wolverines,

Pitt took ﬁve out of six singles

(the Kalesnik-Allison Bucher doubles
match was ruled a default), to improve its
season record to 10-6.

Unlike the past several games,
where the Panthers have struggled early
on in the contest, Pitt jumped out to an
early 5-0 lead on goals by Stephen Love,
Dave Corrado, Ed Swierczyk, Matt
Hoplamazian, and Bret Meyer-Kincak.

Although Pitt lead the entire game,
the Wolverines fought back and made
the game interesting for the dozens of
fans in the upper level of the Cost Center.

The Panthers lead as much as 7-2
before a lapse in the ﬁnal quarter which
allowed Grove City to climb within two

defeated Kara Kaczynski in the only
three-set match of the afternoon.
Hoffman dropped the first set 4-6 before
battling back to win the second set 6-4

Hoffman won the tie-breaker 7-6 to win
her 13th match of the season. No. 5 seed
Beth Gang also recorded her 13th victory
by beating Sarah Russo 6-1, 6-0.

Kalesnik recorded career win No. 35

“She was really deceptive. She got a
lot of balls back with top spin that were

my ball and wait for an opening.”

However, the Panthers hung on alter

senior goaltender Dave Travis said.
“’Ihis game was all hustle. It was a big

Strength and conditioning coordi-

nator Buddy Morris represents every-

thing that's right with the University
of Pittsburgh’s football program.
Morris came from a single-parent
home. With only his mother to earn a
salary to support the family, the
prospect of attending college hinged
on Morris’ work ethic alone. 9
“I ran track for the first couple
years here [at Pitt], which provided
me with financial assistance so I
could attend school,” Morris said.
“My mother just couldn’t afford
to send us to college, so the track
scholarship helped tremendously. So
did working in the Clairton steel
mill.” _
Morris graduated from Pitt in
1980 with a degree in speech and
communications. Pitt football Head
Coach Jackie Sherrill originally
offered Morris a graduate assistant-
ship as a strength .......  ........................................ _ .
coach. Once Morris "  
interviewed for the

and said, ‘You’re in
charge  you're the head guy.’ And
that was it.”

Sherrill’s decision paid dividends
for Pitt football. Morris trained Pitt’s
athletes during one of the program’s

, most successful periods, from 1980 to
‘1989. After the 1989 season though,
~ ‘Morris suffered a personal crisis

which forced him to leave the pro-
gram. His oldest daughter, Kara
Leigh, now 10-years-old, suffered
liver damage due to illness and was
placed on a donor list for a liver trans-
plant.

“When Kara was diagnosed with
her illness and placed on the list a
couple years ago, I had to take some
time to be a parent,” Morris said.
“The most important thing I do in this
world, is I’m a husband, and I'm a
parent  I don’t care how big, how
strong, how tough you think you are,
at the end of that first day I was numb.
It was very hard for me to accept that

my child fights for her life every day.”

After six years away from Pitt,
Morris longed to return to the place
he had called home for 10 years, and
the people who had been there for he
and his ‘wife when his daughter fell
ill.

“It just see ed that all the people
who were coni?ng to help us, ﬁnan-
cially, spiritually, emotionally, were
Pitt people,” Morris said. “Pitt has
given me an opportunity, and I think
this is the greatest place in the world
to be  I think being here is a tremen-
dous honor and privilege for me.
"Being away six years has made me
appreciate that much more how fortu-
nate I am to be here. Every day I get
up, I’m excited to be here.”

The coaching staff didn’t have to
hard-sell the merits of Pitt’s program
to Morris to get him to return.
Although Morris had received inter-
views for positions with the Miami
Dolphins and the Pittsburgh Steelers,
Morris approached Pitt about return-

‘Yeah,’ he just sent us a resume.

Morris’ presence alone, provides
the Pitt program an incredible asset.
His loyalty, work ethic, and energy
inspire everyone around him.

“Buddy is a tremendous asset to

enthusiastic, positive, extremely
motivated, knowledgeable, and he

In November of 1995,
the Panther wrestling
coaches were ecstatic
about landing their first
blue-chip recruit of the
early, signing period.
High school phenom Rob
Loper had agreed to
bring his mat skills here
to Pitt.

Here we are some 16
months later. Having fin-
ished second at the 126-
pound weight class in the
Eastern Wrestling League
tournament, Loper is on
his way to the NCAA
Championships with an
excellent shot at becoming an All-
American.

But the road from Erie

NCAAs has not been completely
smooth for Loper. After having lost

winning,” the 1996

state champ said. “This is
so much harder than high

“I remember the one

talking about goals. He
told me that I should shoot
for 20 wins. I went back to
my room and looked at
how tough the rest of the
schedule was and thought
there was no way I’d ever
get there.”

Loper had 10 losses then; he
has 11 losses now. His record cur-

First, learn to separate yourself from
the horror that your bracket has become.
Remember, it’s the nature of the beast -
nobody would watch the games if it was
easy to pick the winners.

Next, focus your energy on another
sports pursuit. See if you can name five
members of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Convince a friend that the Pitt football
team is heading toward the Nokia Sugar
Bowl.

See if you can be the 1,000th person
to complain about my boss’ most recent
dissertation on backup Pitt point guards.
Sorry, no prize will be awarded — we
blew the awards budget on that television
from the Football Experts contest.

After you’ve recharmeled your nega-
tive energy, sit back and watch the region-
al finals without the bracket in front of
you. It’s crunch time, and there’s no rea-

son to miss good college basketball just ' *

because you thought Thursday’s
matchups would involve Duke, Villanova,
Illinois, and a few other teams that went
home early.

You lost — face it. Now that the pres-
sure’s off, cheer for the underdogs. Take
some Big East pride in the Providence
Friars. Cheer on Dean Smith and his
record-setting season. Be a fan.

Or, if not, there’s always the art of the
side bet. _

Some sports fanatics have outgrown
this Entertainment-Purposes-Only crap
and need a game-by—game gambling fix
for the rest of the way. So what if they pair
off and put a few small bills on the region-
al finals? It might be against a law or two,
but so are the oﬂice pools.

Pick your own method, but it is the
duty of all good sports fans to transcend a
pitiful office pool and once again bore the
rest of the office to death with your sports
expertise. Don’t leta complete inability to
pick the tournament keep you from being
the resident expert — remember, even
Dick Vitale makes mistakes.

So does Dick Clark.

“The win is an important stepping-

Kalesnik thinks the UConn match
and this weekend’s matches with St.
Bonaventure and Villanova will have a
positive effect on the team.

"Ihe UConn and Villanova matches
are important for the freshmen to build
comidence and see what kind of competi-
tion they’ll face in the Big East.”

“We have very good memories of last

Kalesnik said of Pitt’s victories.

“We want to set the tone this weekend

Morris’ training and conditioning
style arises from his personal philos-

negativism. He encourages and

“I believe to win, you" have to be

timidly. Being a freshman and
wrestling some of the top guys in
the country, I was intimidated,” he
said. “I’m just so much more confi-
dent now. I’m wrestling a lot more
aggressively. I go out there and try
to get every point
I can.” .

“Rob went
through the grow-
ing pains that all
freshmen ' go
through,” Payne
said. “He’s
matured a lot just
in this season. I’m
not_ surprised at
all. We knew from
the beginning that _
he had that kind of ability which is
why we recruited him so hard.”

Payne and Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer conveniently showed
up at Loper’s house on the day
before he was to leave for a recruit-
ing ‘trip in which he was to visit sev-
eral other schools.

“At that point, my mind was
pretty much made up. I knew I was
going to go to Pitt,” Loper said.
“But I went on the trip anyway. I
just wanted to take a look to see
what other schools had to offer.”

Loper said that his recruiting
visit here is what really sold Pitt to
him.

“I went out with [Bryan]
Matusic, [John] Withrow, and [J.J.]
Fasnacht and had a great time.
Fasnacht wouldn’t let me leave until
I gave him an oral commitment. I

just knew this was the place I want-
ed to be.” ‘

“I liked him right off the bat,”
Fasnacht explains. “We wanted to
give him a positive impression of
Pitt. We felt getting him to come
here was real important for our pro-
gram.”

With Loper being just a true
freshman, his long-term prospects,
and the future of Pitt wrestling, look
very bright. Since he did not red-
shirt this year, the coaches probably
will redshirt him
later in his career
in order to benefit
the most from his
superb talent.

Loper real-
izes it took a lot
of work to get to
this point, and it
will take a lot
more work to
reach his ultimate
goal —— becoming
a NCAA champion.

He also realizes that he has not
made it this far alone. He credits
John Rupp, a family friend, for first
getting him into wrestling. He also

feels that John Early, his freestyle l

coach, had a lot to do with his suc-
cess on the mat. Off of the mat,
Loper feels support from his grand-
parents has shaped him as a person.

For now, though, Loper must
concentrate on this weekend’s
NCAA Championships. Loper is
one of a school record-seven NCAA
qualifiers who will make the jour-
ney to Northern Iowa for the tourna-
ment.

The other qualifiers include,

Chad Jesko (134), Kevin Johnson ‘

(150), Jake Schaus (158), Withrow
(167), Matusic (177), and Mark
Bodo (190).

The Pitt News would
like to wish all the
wrestlers going to

the NCAA

Championships
this weekend
good luck.
