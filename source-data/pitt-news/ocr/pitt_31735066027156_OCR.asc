Still no replacement for Detre

Highest-paid official at Pitt still here, two years alter resigning

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt spent at least $50,000
and three years trying to find
a replacement for Thomas
Detre, and despite two
search committees over that
time, no one has been named
to fill the post.

Detre, the senior vice
chancellor for health sci-
ences, announced his resig-
nation in the summer of
1992, effective August 31,
1993. That day has come and
gone, and Detre is still at

Pitt, collecting over
$450,000 in salary.

Both search committees
have ended in basically the
same way: four candidates
selected for the job, but no
takers.

James Cunningham, a pro-
fessor in the school of social
work who served on the most
recent committee, said he
“was very disappointed” no
replacement was named.

“It was a very onerous and
time-consuming job,”
Cunningham said. “We did a
tremendous amount of work,

working continuously over a
year and a half, reading 70 to
80 resumes, 40 pages thick.”

Cunningham estimated that
over $50,000 was spent on
bringing people to Pittsburgh
for interviews and various
other expenses. 2

“At least 15 people wer
brought in, and all their
expenses were paid for,” he
said.

The chair of the second
committee, law professor
Mark Nordenberg, could not
be reached for comment on
exactly how much money

was spent on the search.
Two weeks ago, Pitt was
close to naming a successor
for Detre. Edward Benz Jr., a
professor in the the Pitt med-
ical school, was a finalist for
the post. He instead decided
to take a position at Johns
Hopkins University, and
according to Pitt vice chan-
cellor for student and public
affairs Leon Haley, after
Benz left, the replacement
process was put on hold.
After the first committee’s
work did not result in a suc-

Hillel gives Jewish students a voice

By Nikki Prevenslik
For The Pitt News i

There once was a time when the
Hillel Foundation for Jewish cam-
pus life was considered too reli-
gious, too nerdy and downright

unimaginative.

However, Hillel of the ‘90s has
adopted a new approach, enhanc-
ing positive Jewish life on campus
by emphasizing student involve-

ment.

“While students are searching for
their identity, we try and offer them
positive outlooks on Judaism and

positive ways to learn more about

who they are and where they’re

coming from,” said program asso-
ciate Shana Flatt.

Hillel was founded 70 years ago
for Jewish students in the 1920s

Since then, it has expanded to 105

foundations which in recent years

have faced their share of struggles

—— small staffs, financial problems

and poor distribution of student
involvement and control.‘

Asst. News Editor

The new wave in health care degrees is master’s pro-
grams which allow health care professionals to broaden
the scope of their course work. -

In an effort to meet the needs of a growing number of
health science professionals, the Graduate School of
Public Health has added the multidisciplinary master of
public health program. ’

This master’s program trains graduates to perform the
roles of public health generalists and public health lead-
ership positions. '

According to Duane Kavinsky, the program’s coordi-

.nator, the multidisciplinary master’s gives individuals

with health service degrees the opportunity to further
pursue the public health education they were exposed to
in their doctorate degrees.

Typically, a physician who enters GSPH is guided into
one of the school’s six departments, said Kavinsky.
These departments include biostatistics, environmental
occupational health, health service administration, epi-
demiology, human genetics and infectious disease
microbiology.

The multidisciplinary program requires students to
take core courses which expose them to all of the six
areas without concentrating in a specific area. This pro-
vides the experience needed to practice general public
health services to various parts of the community.

Dr. John Benitez decided to enter the program after he
became the medical director of the Poison Center.

“The Poison Center is a public health agency, and I
thought the public health experience would be helpful,”
said Benitez.

Benitez is also the head of toxicology fellowships at
UPMC, and he feels the multidisciplinary degree has
been beneficial in this area of his career.

“You can make it [the degree] fit your needs,” said
Benitez. “I have specialized training in other areas, and
it allowed me to choose where I wanted to‘ go [with the
training].” '

“It offers an overview instead of focusing on one spe-
cific area,” said Janet Sloan, support administrator for
GSPH. J

According to Sloan, there are np "limitations to gener-
alizing the area of study.

“It opens the doors to leadership and administration in
the public health community,” she said.

In a newsletter, GSPH said it expects graduates will
practice in areas such as clinical setting, public health
agencies and instructional settings in community and
teaching hospitals.

Kavinsky said the program has two primary aims -

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-
Herzegovina — French United
Nations peacekeepers com-
manded by Lt. Col. Jean—Pau1
Michel were attacked by the
Bosnian Serbs. The ﬁring came
last Friday just a few hours
after the declared NATO air
strike.

Twenty-one soldiers, who

were members of the Fifth

Infantry Battalion, were sta-
tioned just south of the Bosnian
capital when the Serbs
demanded their surrender by
using an array of bullets.

The firing and use of
grenades destroyed three U.N.
vehicles parked out front of
their position. The 21 soldiers
are currently being.held with
325 other hostages as insurance
against further NATO air
strikes. - The New York Times

TEHERAN, Iran — In a vain
effort to hold onto power, Iran’s
government has permitted a
surprising amount of freedom.
Leaders are allowing the elect-
ed Parliament to override the
wishes of the president and are
allowing scholarly journals to
critique the one-party system.
The theocracy that once
inspired the nation has only
turned to uncertainty and
‘unpredictability. And President
Hashemi Rafsanjani’s econom-
ic reform plan has been aban-
doned after only three years.
The inefficient leadership has

resulted in the steady decline of
revolutionary ideals and con-
cerns of corruption. - The New

NEFTEGORSK, Russia — In
Russia’s Far East yesterday,
rescuers worked to retrieve vic-
tims from an earthquake that
may have killed at least 2,000
people.

Measuring at 7.5 on the
Richter scale, the earthquake
destroyed most of the sleeping
city at 1:03 a.m. on Sunday.
Russia’s Minister for
Emergency situations, Sergei
K. Shoygu, told the Itar-Tass
news agency that 300 bodies
have been found so far.

Neftegorsk is located on
Sakhalin Island, 4,500 miles

LEON, Mexico —— An opposi-

party caused the biggest elec-
toral defeat in more than six
years in the country.

Farmer Vicente Fox crushed
Mexico’s ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party in the race
for governor in the central city
of Guanajuanto on Sunday.

The PRI holds all but four of
the country’s 32 states, and the
result was not enough to alter
their power. However, Fox’s
victory of 58.5 percent comes
at a time when President
Ernesto Zedillo’s popularity is

at the bottom of the scale. - The

BEIJING — Amnesty
International said yesterday that
Chinese police have jailed hun-
dreds of Tibetan monks and
nuns for torturing children
accused of political offenses..

The report said that many of
the 45 juveniles arrested
between 1991 and 1994 had
been tortured, ill-treated, held
with adult prisoners and forced
to do hard labor.

Amnesty said many of the
child novices were tortured into
confessing, and many died of
various illnesses while in
prison or shortly after being
released. A

The oppression expressed by
the Tibetan monks and nuns
was attributed to recent restric-
tions put on Buddhist worship
in the area and also to limita-

cessor being named to the post,
Edward Stricker, a neuroscience pro-
fessor and the chair of that commit-
tee, said, “They [Pitt and the candi-
dates] weren’t able to come to a
mutual understanding on both sides,”
according to the University Times.

The two sides in question are Pitt
and the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, two groups that
have been in some controversy late-
ly,., Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor
recently decided to allow Blue
Cross, a medical group affiliated
with UPMC, to become the sole
health care provider for Pitt faculty
and staff, upsetting many Pitt faculty
members who had voted to keep
HealthAmerica, in addition to Blue
Cross. That decision led to increased
feelings of animosity between Pitt
faculty and UPMC.

Senate Council President James
Holland said the problem with
replacing Detre is the “refusal to
come grips with the [medical] orga-

nization.”

“The incoming person would need
to know they are in full control of
the medical school,” Holland said.

After the formation of the second
committee, Holland said the position
would be difficult to fill, because the
“job is subordinate to that of Jeffrey
Romoff, president of the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center,”
according to the Sept. 15, 1994,
issue of the University Times .

Cunningham said that some of the
blame for failing to replace Detre
lies with the board of trustees.

“I feel that the board of trustees
dropped the ball,” Cunningham said.
“They failed_to move with any
aggressiveness.”

After the second committee com-

pleted its work and no replacement
was named, Pitt’s board of trustees
stepped in and said no one will take
over for Detre until a replacement is
found for O’Connor.

Detre could not be reached for
comment.

Hillel

 

The Pitt News,

*'From page 1

serves about 3,000 students from Pitt and
CMU, including graduate students‘ from
both campuses.

“I think Hillel has really turned around
a lot,” said Pitt senior Brian Lockner. “I
wasn’t really involved in Hillel up until
this year basically because the governing
structure that was in place at the time
was very exclusive. It really didn’t allow
students to get involved because it was
staff driven and not programmed for us.”

Lockner, who is a Diplomatic
Chairman for Hillel, said this year the
students created an open forum to give
more students a say in what goes on.

A driving force in the new and

improved Hillel is Dr. Barbara Burstin,

recently elected president of the Hillel
Foundation of Pittsburgh ‘Governing
Board and a professor in history and
Jewish studies at Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon University. As vice president, she
headed the Restructuring Committee
Task Force that paved the way for the
rejuvenation of Hillel on Pittsburgh area
campuses;

“It is exciting to be taking over the
leadership reigns of a major Jewish orga-
nization. Clearly, at a point when stu-

dents are forging their life plans and per-
haps choosing their spouses, we must do
all we can to involve them Jewishly,”
said Burstin.

“Not only is Hillel a support network,
but a very active and thriving organiza-
tion for students to create programs that
they want,” said Flatt.

Hillel emphasizes empowerment and
engagement through experiences, events
and personal interaction. Activities and
programs are planned solely by students
who like to organize social activities that
are culturally diverse. A recent cruise on
the Gateway Clipper and a fashion show
fundraiser for charity involving African-
American and Jewish students from
CMU proved to have successful results.

“It was the first time that Hillel ever
participated with another student organi-
zation in such a formal capacity,” said
Flatt, adding the experience was so suc-
cessful because it was great to see such
interaction between two cultures working
together and sharing a common goal.

Most of Hillel’s success can be attrib-
uted to the 11 current special interest
groups organized by students including
the Women’s Interest Group, Community
Service Group and Israel Affairs

Committee. There’s also a Jewish
Community Relations Council, which
strives to develop and improve campus
relations with other religious, ethnic,
racial and cultural groups.

“Our approach is that being Jewish is
not a religion, being Jewish is part of a
people,” said Executive Director Rabbi
Art Donsky.

Through Hillel, Burstin and Donsky
plan on reaching more students and giv-
ing them a positive experience and iden-
tity during their college years.
“[Outgoing president] Sherman Shrager
has done so much for this organization.
Now my job is to continue the momen-
tum he has generated,” said Burstin. “I
look forward to the task.”

“You can be anything you want to be
on campus, but just also remember that
there’s a very positive piece of you that’s
Jewish. Come make that a positive piece
for everybody else,” said Donsky,
encouraging Jewish students to become
more active in the organization ’

Any students interested in becoming a
part of Hillel can stop by their offices,
located above Cafe Arabica on the corner
of South Craig Street and Forbes
Avenue, or they can call 621-8875.

to provide complementary pub-
lic health education to
advanced medical students and
to create a mechanism to go
through GSPH without focus-
ing on any particular depart-
ment.

“It really gives [graduates]
extra credentials to advance in
their careers,” said Kavinsky.

Benitez is the school’s first
multidisciplinary master gradu-
ate, but the program is well on
its way.

“When I was going through
the program, there were only
two or three other students,”
said Benitez.

According to Sloan, the pro-
gram now has about 17 stu-
dents enrolled.

Benitez said he feels that, in
the age of corporatization of
health care, this is the direction
many doctoral degrees in the
health sciences will want to
pursue.

He did say there are li-mita—
tions for those who want to spe-
cialize in a certain area of study.

But the whole idea behind the
program is to provide exposure
to health care professionals
who desire more public health
or community-based experi-
ence.

“The community really
doesn’t know about it yet,” said
Kavinsky.

GSPH is hoping to attract
more medical, dental and vet-
erinary students who normally
would not specialize in epi-
demiology or toxicology, or
any of the school’s depart-
ments, to explore this unique
public health master.

The program is open to hold-
ers of doctoral degrees in health
sciences and advanced medical,
dental and veterinary students.
The program also extends to
individuals’ with extensive
experience in health—related
fields and students with
advanced standing from other
professional schools.

Unabridged freedom

Congress shall make no law  abridging the freedom“of
speech, or of the press 

This is from the text of the First Amendment to the
Constitution, ratified by the states in 1791. If you don’t already
know it, memorize it. Surprisingly, however, after 204 years that
is exactly what the 104th Congress is trying to do.

According to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, a House panel
moved the proposed constitutional amendment banning desecra-
tion of the American flag one more step toward passage. Last
Thursday, the seven Republicans on the panel outnumbered the
five Democrats in the vote to send the proposed amendment to
the House Judiciary Committee. .

The debate on whether to make desecration of the American
flag illegal is one which sparks passionate responses. Those who
value freedom of expression hold the First Amendment to
include the right to desecrate the flag. Supporters of the pro-

posed anti-desecration amendment, however, say that desecra— .

tion is tantamount to treason.

In the 206 years since the Constitution was first put into
effect, Congress has only seen it necessary to amend the docu-
ment 27 times. The l04th Congress has proposed this would-be
28th Amendment in order to circumvent the Supreme Court’s
inevitable decision to find the amendment unconstitutional. The
Court would be bound to find the law unconstitutional if it were
only a statute, as it directly contradicts the First Amendment.
Should such a law, then, be allowed to be written directly into
the document which it contradicts? No.

Freedom of expression is something which we should all hold
dearly. Proponents of the amendment argue that flag-desecration
is equivalent to destroying the symbol of that very thing which
guarantees the freedom to do so. If a person ,.does not value the
ideals behind the ﬂag, should that person then be protected by
those ideals?

The answer to this question is yesi The Constitution does not
discriminate based on political beliefs or affiliations. While we
neither condone nor support desecration of the flag, we do not
think there should be a law against it.

Efforts in Washington to make flag“ desecration illegal are a
potential threat to all freedom of exprPitession. Though you
may agree with allowing this particular exception to freedom of
expression, it should be questioned whether Congress has the
right to limit any type of expression. Flag-buming does spark a
lot of anger, but it is still a form of expression. If Congress is
allowed to establish this limit, where will the exceptions and
limits end?

Flag-burning is a form of protest, and a relatively non-violent
one. In the grander scheme, it is preferable to protests against
the government which result in countless deaths, like the
Oklahoma City bombing. Though ﬂag desecration may be con-
sidered unpatriotic or un-American, it should not be unlawful
nor unconstitutional.

Financial aid cuts

Dear Editor:

In an effort to balance the
federal budget, Congress voted
to cut $30 billion in student
financial aid. Many programs
that help put students through
school may fall under the con-
gressional axe unless we act
quickly to fight the cuts. The
Perkins Loan and
Supplemental Grant programs
may be terminated, pending
final passage of the federal
budget and a hearing in June.
Pell grants and College Work-
Study will also be cut signifi-
cantly. In a time in which
Congress is under pressure to
trim the budget in any way
possible, nothing is sacred.
Students around the country
must let Washington know that
this slashing of our investment
in higher education is unac-
ceptable!

Many lawmakers believe
that they can cut student aid
programs because college stu-
dents as a whole aren’t as
vocal politically as other sec-
tors of the population. Only a
fraction of college-aged people
voted in the 1994 midterm
elections. There are also only a
handful of interest groups rep-
resenting student concerns in
Washington. But the truth is
that investing in higher educa-
tion increases productivity and
economic growth, leads to a
higher tax base and strength-
ens our global competitive-
ness. It is some of the best
money our government spends
and has long enjoyed biparti-
san support. Moreover, opin-
ion polls show that the
American public strongly sup-
ports federal financial aid.
Disinvestment in student aid is
a cheap, shortsighted attempt
to trim the deficit. Indeed, bal-
ancing the federal budget is an
admirable goal, as future gen-
erations should not have to
suffer because our government
couldn’t make ends meet in the

1990s. But if Washington real-
ly wants to do something ben-
eficial for our generation, cut-
ting $30 billion in, student aid
is not the answer. What good
is a balanced budget if we are
unable to gain the skills neces-
sary to earn a living?

A good number of Pitt stu-
dents receive federal financial
aid. Many of these students
will be forced to drop out if
these programs are curtailed.
Many more potential students
will never get to start college.
Even students who don’t
receive financial aid will be
adversely affected by the uni-
versities’ loss of revenue as a
result of the decreased enroll-
ment. All university services,
from academic computing to
health services to student gov-
ernment, will feel the financial
burden.

It’s time for students to get
active in preserving their right
to quality, affordable higher
education. Call your senators
and congresspeople today, ask
for a person who works on
education or budget issues and
tell them to restore $30 billion
to higher education as part of
the final budget resolution.
Also, Student Government
Board will be sponsoring a
petition drive this week. We
will be sending students’ let-
ters to Congress and President
Clinton. Please stop-by the
SGB office (639 William Pitt
Union) to add your name to
the growing list of students
who are fed up with
Washington’s proposals to
abandon higher education.
Let’s send our politicians a
strong message: “Don’t cut our
future short! Don’t cut finan-
cial aid!”

Free speech

Dear Editor:
I appreciate your column
and that of the editorial board

in the May 24 issue of The Pitt
News.

You are right, and I com-
mend your efforts to ensure

freedom of speech is alive and .

well in the USA. One must
wonder about those trying to
limit that speech. 4
Even if we do not ,agre.e'with
what a radio talk show host

says, a journalist writes or a.

teacher professes, we can still
respect the rights we have.
People must have the chance
to present ideas. Then let the
merit of the ideas stand the test
of time. Do the Thought Police
fear losing power/control if
other ideas are expressed?
Truth and ideals will always
live.

Jim Quinn’s morning show
on WRRK highlights some of
the various viewpoints alive
today. We may not agree with
every single thing he says, but
can appreciate some of the dif-
ferent perspectives he brings to
the issues. They make listeners
stop and think.

On Thursday, May 25, 1995,
he mentioned the proposed
amendment against flag burn-
ing. There are other ways to
exercise free speech than bum-
ing ﬂags and stealing newspa-
pers. He also talked about how
tolerant the framers of our

’ Constitution were.

He opined that some may
want liberalism to become the
religion of the state. It is not as
tolerant as other religions. If
speech is truly free, then why
restrict it or refuse to fund it?

More and more people are
devoting their money and time
to the causes they believe in.
People need to carefully con-
sider all aspects of the issues
to be open-minded.

It is important that the media
present all facets of the issues.
Thank you for bringing these
issues to our attention and
please continue.

  [:~[I1:ltlil} Boukﬁ are

They're primarily childish,
banal and masturbatory, yet,
like all of popular culture,
some comic books are actually
good. Not many, mind you.
More like 5 percent of every-
thing produced. Maybe 2.

I’m just being realistic here,
and, in turn, trying to find that
small piece of quality in the
sea of drek.

For the most part you can
cancel out anything involving
super-heroes or costumes.
That’s not a prejudice, it’s a
reality. The stories included in
comics with the words “incredi-
ble” or “amazing” in the title
are neither. They replace actu-
al emotions with that of
aggression and physical
appeal (women with huge
breasts and men more defined
than Joe Weider), and in turn
create sociological falsehoods
more garish than even super-
powers and nuclear-induced
madness.

The unreal is not unaccept-
able, though. Entertainment is
all about things that probably
never will happen — bizarre
car chases or visits from
aliens. But it must supplement
the story, not control it.

From Hell

Alan Moore, writer

Eddie Campbell, artist

Mad Love/Kitchen Sink Press

For the past several years
writer Alan Moore and artist
Eddie Campbell have been
retelling the story of Jack the
Ripper in their From Hell
series. Certainly not the defini-
tive (and not really striving to
be) history of the character,
the story unfolds slowly and
meticulously in reviewing the
story of the Whitechapel mur-
ders. Obsessive at times (each
issues contains five to 10
pages of notes researched
from numerous histories and
texts), the comic shows the
attitude and actions of the era,
the odd medical practices and
police investigations, plus the
hysteria created through the
connections to British royalty.

The best part of From Hell,
though, is not in the actions of
Jack the Ripper himself, but of
the victims, prostitutes in an
era of seemingly endless dirt
and soot of the industrialized
Victorian period, and those try-
ing to solve the mystery, them-
selves unclean and devious.

Their connections, which
Moore makes admirably, make

Domu comes off as a spectac-
ular and interesting-looking
book.

As with many Japanese
comics,some of the intricacies
of the story take a back seat to
a methodic plotting of the art
and action. in many instances
it may becomes boring, a
style-before-substance plod-
ding that hurts most comics
today, but in Domu the action
clearly reflects the child vs.
adult conflict in the story, and it
becomes more important when
the smaller, supporting charac-
ters come out and reveal
themselves to be foolish and
problematic (like kids).

in Domu, Otomo does what
is necessary in comics for
good entertainment. He com-
bines quality art with an inter-
esting writing style and story
and succeeds where so many
fail in the adventure mode; a
story that never becomes too
much of a bad thing, never
leaving the boundaries that
separate interesting from far-
fetched and just plain bad.

They’re out there, these
quality comics. You just have
to look for them.

Burnt By the Sun
Written and directed by Nikita
Mikhalkov

With Nikita Mikhalkov, Oleg
Menchikov and lngeborga
Dapkounaite

Two central characters, one
day. How much can so little
say about Stalin’s 1930s?
Much more than those plot-
twisting historical epics that
span decades and feature
more characters than even the
most attentive viewer can han-
dle. Few historically based
texts work this way. What we
usually get is a meandering
James Michener epic or some-
thing like Bertolucci’s 1900.

“Day in the life of” stories are
common, of course, but few
manage to tell as much as
Nikita Mikhalkov’s Burnt By
the Sun does with so few nar-
rative crutches. Spike Lee
pulled it off with Do the Flight
Thing and offered a “feel” for
Bed-Stuy’s street politics, but
Spike downplayed any specific
historical reference in favor of
different aesthetics: atmos-
phere and character. So
what’s so engaging about
Burnt by the Sun, then, is that

 

 

Mikhalkov s text does both.
offering atmosphere as well as
a substantial slice of history.
It’s a credit to both Lee and
Mikhalkov that they address
specific politics of complicated
situations with economic nar-
ratives. Bertolucci’s 1900,
albeit a fine piece of work in its
own right, didn't do this. On
the other hand, what we find in
1900 and what’s missing from
Burnt By the Sun is the move-
ment of history. Bertolucci’s
film was more bound to time
than Mikhalkov’s and could
deliver more specifics about
the rise and fall of Italian fas-
cism.
So, then, let’s talk about the
narrative. Burnt by the Sun
opens on a summer day in
1936 in rural Russia. Serguei
Kotov (played -by Nikita
Mikhaltov), an aging hero of
the Bolshevik revolution, has
been comfortably spending his

time with wife Maroussia-

(lngeborga Dapkounaite),
daughter Nadia (Nadia
Mikhalkov, Nikita’s daughter in
real life) and various other
family and friends. Later in the
moiining arrives Mitia (Oleg
Menchikov), who

was

memories to the agitation of
Serguei. As the personal ten-
sion between Mitia and
Serguei escalates, we find out
Mitia now works for Stalin’s
secret police has come to the
household with a suspect
agenda.

What followsis an engaging
portrait of a complicated and
often misunderstood era.

8Cloud Nine
on Forbes

Unlike most people who
form their own theater compa-
ny, Carey Smith didn't exactly
have a season in mind. She
just wanted a showcase for
her directing talents, so last
year she formed Totally Bard
Theater, produced
Shakespeare's The Taming of
the Shrew and donated all of
the proceeds to charity. Yet,
when the opportunity arose for
a second season, she invited
David Tener to join her as oo-
artistic director and jumped at
the chance to produce the odd
combo Othello and Cloud
Nine.

“lt’s very collaborative,”
Smith explains. “The main
point is not to sell tickets, it’s
for the people involved to learn
something.”

Composed centuries apart,
the plays were paired together
because they both make
strong statements involving
racial/sexual issues. Othello
has an extended stage to fur-
ther involve the audience in its
modern twist: having the
media represent the corruption
— sending the confusing mes-
sages, because in the period

of the original, Othello’ would
have been scrutinized by
those around him. Using video
playback, the 10 actors bring
this tale of revenge, hate and
love so close, Smith
explained, “You can’t distance
yourself from it.”

So how did Smith, a self-
proclaimed woman's director,
portray the deceived, disillu-
sioned. A distressed
Desdemona? ‘‘I made her
stronger. She is not portrayed
as weak, just uninformed.
Usually Desdemona’s just a
figurehead  a shadow. I
wanted to have her make her
own decisions.” Smith
explained that the real tragedy
of the play is that you like both
Othello (played by Scott
Nunnelly) and Desdemona
(Julie Paparella), and you
know that the situation could
have been resolved, but it
never is.

On the flip side, David Tener
directs the comedy Cloud
Nine, set in 1880 Victorian
Africa and 1980s London. Men
portray women, women por-
tray men, and the daughter in
Act I is played by a doll
because daughters had no

raters under

place in Victorian society. (And
Act ll is supposed to be the
surreal act.) The play makes a
statement about the oppres-
sion of sexuality using comedy
as a release.

Tener says he better under-
stands the play since the first
few productions. “When you
direct a comedy, you can’t find
out how it’s going to (go over)
until you go in front of an audi-
ence.” He finds himself repeat-
edly workshopping.

With more than a handful of
Shakespeare productions
being produced this summer in
Pittsburgh on a wide range of
budgets, I wondered if Tener
felt challenged. “lt’s just going
to become more popular,” he
told me. Overabundance of
productions is not an issue.
“The lack of Shakespeare is
what’s hurting. Shakespeare is
constantly reinterpreted to fit
the times. Each generation
gets a different perspective,
and that’s pretty damn coo|.”

Both Tener and Smith are
discussing the aspiration of
one day uniting smaller the-
one name.
However, Smith still wants it to
remain as a showcase for
young area directors. Original
concepts are everything.

Othello and Cloud Nine are
running in repetition at
Luciano’s Coffeehouse,
Forbes .Ave. downtown,
through June 17. Call 281-
6877 for performance times
and ticket information.

Due to the countless entertainment

options the city has to offer, I will
attempt to weed the night life garden
and offer a lone ‘show of the week’ sug-
gestion. After glancing my concert cal-
ender, Sunday, June 4th, was forever
etched in my memory. On this coveted
date, l.uciano’s Coffee House will host
seminal New Zealand noise rockers,
Dead C. The band is foremost a punk
ensemble with a handle on crushing
rhythms and pounding drums. Of course,
the band is most famous for their sear-
ing white noise explosions, and scream-
ing dissonant overloads. But don't dis-
miss this as soul-less noise! The Dead C
prove that noise can be beautiful and
subtle, too. There is much depth to their
music as well as diversity, and it will
surely carry over well live. Pittsburgh
has been blessed by performances from
fellow New Zealan_der's Peter Jefferies,
and Trash last year, and this show will
continue the saga. Perhaps Chris Knox
will be next! Opening the show is
Blunderbuss (celebrating a CD release on
Homestead-buy it!!), and a new local
group Storm and Stress featuring Ian
from Don Cab on guitar, George from T4
and ‘Don Cab on bass, and Kevin from 40
Stories on drums. Whew! A new super
group...Don't miss this 8PM show on
June 4th at Luciano's.

Columnist
Matt
Grove

ob Dylan

said it

best
_ when he
crooned, “The times, they are a’
changing!” It is highly unlikely s
that Dylan foresaw the resurrec-
tion that Pitt basketball is under-
going as we near the millenni-
um, but nevertheless the
Panthers are, like George and
Weezie, movin’ on up!

Pitt beganxthis trek last spring
by landing Ralph Willard as the
replacement for Paul Evans.
Many wondered if VV1llard could
work the same magic at Pitt that
he had at Western Kentucky, tak-
ing that team to the Sweet 16 of
the NCAA Tournament in 1993.

In a little over a year, it seems
that he has begun.

Pitt fought through a rough
season last year and Willard
could have easily given up, but
instead he brought in one of the
best recruiting classes in Pitt his-
tory. Vtfrth the likes of Mark
Blount, Vonteego Cummings
and Isaac Hawkins, the Panthers
have instantly become con-
tenders once again.

But what is the next step in
this journey for Pitt? The answer
to that question may be closer
than we think.

The Master Space Plan
unveiled by the university could
provide the ﬁnal piece of the
puzzle for the Panther program,
while at the same time acting as
the tool that keeps Willard in
Oakland.

The proposed Convocation
Center has the potential to rank
Pitt among the elite in college
basketball and offers positive
changes for the entire communi-
ty. The opposition argues that the
area does not need a
Convocation Center because it
will only add to present prob-
lems and quite possibly cause
new ones.

It is difficult to agree with
those opposed to this project
when you look at the dividends
this could pay.

A new, attractive facility will
help bring Pitt in the blue-chip
recruits on a consistent basis.
Not only has Pitt lost out in
recent years on a national level,
we carmot seem to keep the local
recruits here either.

Case in point is Danny
Fortson, the 6-foot-9 power for-
ward from Shaler High School,
who played his way onto the
Sports Illustrated All-Freshman
Team with the Cincinnati
Bearcats. ’

Despite being so close to
home, Pitt did not actively pur-
sue Fortson and it fell off his list
of schools early. It was not a case

Pitcher Tedde Campbell gets congratulatedby his teammates after being taken out against Oklahoma State in Pitt's
ﬁrst game. Campbell pitched 13.1 innings in four NCAA regional games, with one win, one loss and one save.

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. —- By
winning the Big East
Tournament, Pitt found itself in a
position it hadn’t been in for 30
years — making travel arrange-
ments for an NCAA regional

appearance at Lindsey Nelson

Stadium in Knoxville.

Pitt also found itself in another
position — it had the opportunity
to notch the ﬁrst NCAA wins in
school history.

“It’s something special being
there,”_said head coach Mark
Jackson. “I hope it’s something
that [the team] will remember for
the rest of their lives.”

Pitt, the ﬁfth seed, had to open
up the double-elirnination tourna-
ment against the second-seeded
Oklahoma State Cowboys, partic-
ipants in their 15th consecutive
regional and the highest scoring
team in the country.

The Panthers got on the board
ﬁrst, in the second inning, thanks
in part to faulty fielding by the
Cowboys’ outﬁeld.

First baseman Rob Garvey
doubled to right and then
advanced to third on Sam
Crowley’s ground out to short.
Garvey then scored after Joe
Carter’s ﬂy ball to right was
dropped by OSU’s Herb
Hardcastle.

Pitt padded its lead by adding
two runs in the fourth off
Cowboy starter Jason Bell (12-3).
After a single by Jon DeBemardis
and another double by Garvey,
Crowley grounded out to short,

- scoring DeBemardis.

Their third run came in off a
double-steal attempt. Carter
walked and attempted to steal
second. Garvey, who was at third,
crossed the plate before Carter
was tagged out in a rundown.

Ace Tedde Campbell got the
call for the Panthers, and kept the
hard-hitting Cowboy offense in
check early in the game.

"I felt that I had the game in
control for the first four imrings,”
said Campbell. “ As the game
wore on, they adjusted more to
my breaking pitches. It’s tough to

In the bottom of the fourth,

 

with two outs, OSU’s Beau
Champoux was hit by a
Campbell pitch. He then stole

‘ second and scored on a single by

center ﬁelder Brian Aylor.

The next inning, the Cowboys
knotted the game at three. Rusty
MacNamara led off with a walk
Campbell managed to get the
next two batters out, but then
made his -only mistake of the
game. i

“It was a 3-2 pitch and he hung
it,” said Cowboy first baseman
Chris Richard. “He might have
been a little tired, or lost concen-
tration, but I got it and it went
out.”

Oklahoma State then got the
go-ahead run in the next inning,
off the bat of Champoux. His
400-foot homer to right gave the
Cowboys a lead they wouldn’t
relinquish.

 

“[Campbell] started off trying

The Cowboys added two runs
in the eighth, one off Mike
Rohrbach, who came in for
Campbell, making the ﬁnal score
6-3. Pitt was sent to the loser’s
bracket. "

Oklahoma State’s head coach,
Gary Ward was very impressed
with what he saw from the
Panthers and especially
Campbell, who strained a muscle
in his rib cage in the second
inning. He pitched seven and a
third innings, giving up ﬁve runs
on eight hits, with three strikeouts
and three walks. His record fell to
14-4.

“As a ballclub, they played
very smart baseball.” Ward said.
“Because baseball is so impacted
by who’s on the bump, if they
have a smart guy out there han-
dling the baseball, it all starts with
him.

“Pitt threw a guy out there that

'GAME2

  
   

On Friday, the Panthers came
out smoking against The Citadel,
the sixth-seed, who lost to host
Tennessee the previous night, 5-2.

Jason Conti drew a two-out
walk and stole second. Citadel
pitcher Brian Callahan then
walked DeBemardis, who also
stole second after Conti moved to
third on a wild pitch. They both
scored on a single to right by
Garvey.

Garvey then moved to third on
a single by Crowley that rico-
cheted off Callahan’s leg and into
the Citadel dugout. Another dou-
ble steal attempt scored Garvey,
and Crowley was safe at second.

Pitt scored their third run of the ,

inning, as Crowley scored on a
single by Jeff Murse.

Panther starter Chris Bean held
the Bulldogs scoreless through
the first four innings. Citadel
pitchers were not quite, as fortu-
nate, as head coach Fred Jordan
used three during that time and
six in the game.

“Pitt did a great job of being
very patient,” Jordan said. “You
can’t defend the walk, and they
had some timely hits behind

them. You’ve got to establish,

where the umpire’s strike zone is
and throw it right there.
Unfortunately, we weren’t able to
do that”

Throughout the game, the
Panthers scored a total of seven
runs on eight walks and two hit
batters.

Pitt scored two more runs in the
second, and then added four more
in the fourth, giving itself a 10-0

- advantage.

In the fourth, it was catcher Bill
Derr notching his ﬁrst hit of the
series, and one of his three on the
day. He moved to second on Josh
Mellor’s walk. Kurt Womelsdorf
was then hit by a John Hinkle
pitch to load the bases.

Another walk to Conti scored
Derr, and a DeBemardis single
off the wall in right scored Mellor.
That RBI for DeBemardis tied the
school’s single-season mark at 48.

Womelsdorf and Conti crossed
the plate for the ﬁnal Pitt runs of
the inning after Crowley’s
grounder to third was booted by
Bo Betchman.

The Citadel scored two runs in
the fifth, making it 10-2. First
baseman Ryan Butler walked and
scored on a fielder’s choice to
David Beckley, and catcher Dan
Crosby singled and scored on a
sacriﬁce ﬂy to center by designat-
ed hitter, Donald Morillo.

In the bottom of the inning, the
Pitt scored two more runs, their
final two of the game.

In the sixth, Bean gave up a
leadoff walk and was replaced
with Kevin Kramer, who got the
next batter out with a fielder’s
choice, and then Terrance Smalls
grounded into a double play.

Bean finished the game with
five innings of work, giving up
five hits, two runs (one earned),
while striking out five and walk-
ing two.

The Panthers looked to be well
on their way to capturing their
f1rst—ever NCAA tournament vic-
tory. However, the Bulldogs
wouldn’t go quietly.

Kramer gave up two more runs
in the eighth on a homer to right
by the Bulldog’s left fielder, Curt
Beerman.

Then in the ninth, just as Pitt
had done the previous weekend,
The Citadel mounted a come-
back.

Four straight hits, including a
three—run homer by Morillo led to
Kramer’s exit, with Pitt still ahead
12-8. Lefty Mike Rohrbach came
in and gave up two hits and a
walk with one run scoring.

Then, with no outs and runners
on first and third, Jackson went to
the bullpen once again, this time
for Campbell.

“I was ready,” Campbell said.
“I was actually trying to point to
[Jackson] to get me in there. It’s
just a situation I like to be in.”

Campbell struck out right ﬁeld-
er Dale Sistara for the first out of
the inning. Butler grounded into a
f1e1der’s choice, scoring Garrick

Haltiwanger. With two outs, Pitt
was still up 12-10.

That’s where it would end, as
Campbell got leadoff batter David
Beckley to ground to short and
end the game.

Campbell got his second save

of the season, and Bean evened «

his record at 2-2.

“We wanted to make the game
real exciting for the fans. I think
we were able to do that,” Jackson
joked after the game.
“Fortunately, we were able to run
our offense early in the game,
score a lot of runs and be in posi-
tion to give up a few at the end.”

More importantly, with the win,
Pitt kept its World Series hopes
alive.

“I told the team after our
Thursday’s game, ‘Be very posi-
tive about what happened. You
showed you belong in the touma—
ment, come out and play like that
tomorrow.’ They did that,”
Jackson added.

With their victory over The
Citadel, up next for the Panthers
was third-seeded California on
Saturday afternoon.

GAME3

“They were a good team. They
weren’t a strong offensive team
like ourselves, but they had good
pitching,” said Jackson.

The Golden Bears jumped out
on top early with a run in the bot.
tom of the second. Left fielder
Jonathan Petke scored on a Cody
McCormick double to right ﬁeld
off of Gregg Mrochko, Pitt’s
starter.

The Panthers countered with
two runs in the top of the second
and then one run in the third,
putting Pitt on top 3-]. In the
third, Garvey kept up his torrid
hitting pace, singling to center and
knocking in Conti who had
reached on a f1elder’s choice and
stole second, his 32nd of the year.

Garvey finished the tournament
with a .412 batting average, five
RBI and six runs. Three of his
seven hits were doubles.

In the fifth inning, Cal came

back and tied the score at three. '

After Pete Economos was hit by a

Mrochko pitch, the long ball con-

tinued to plague the Panthers.

°From page 10
First baseman Mike Wolger sent
a shot over the wall in right—cen-
ter.

Campbell came in for his third
appearance in three days and got
the next two batters to ground out
and ﬂy out respectively.

In the sixth, the Panthers took
the lead and never looked back,
scoring four runs on four hits.

A Garvey double to right was
followed by a Crowley single to
center. Murse then singled, scor-
ing Garvey. Derr singled to right,
scoring Crowley. Murse scored
on a f1elder’s choice by Mellor,
and Derr scored the final run of
the inning on a wild pitch.

“I was upset about the lack of
intensity in their big sixth inning,”
said Cal head coach Bob Milano.
“Nobody was willing to step up
and put the brakes on.”

From there, Pitt only gave up
one more run, while adding two
of their own to make the ﬁnal 9-4.

In the game, both Garvey and
Crawley were three for five and
scored two runs apiece. Campbell
raised his record to 15-4 on the

. SC'dSOIl.

“We were fortunate to get off to
a quick start and score some
runs,” said Jackson. ‘They proba-
bly got discouraged because they
got behind early, but they’re deﬁ-
nitely a good team.”

The party ended here, though,
as Pitt was scheduled to face
Oklahoma State for the second
time, a mere half hour after their
victory over Cal.

GAME4

Mike Rohrbach got the call for
the Panthers and pitched three
innings giving up three hits and
five runs. .

A solo homer by catcher J .T.
Messick in the second got the
Cowboys in front 1-0.

Pitt answered in the bottom
half of the inning. Garvey walked
and eventually scored on a wild
pitch. DH Tyler Shantz singled
and scored on an error by first
baseman Tal Light. And, Ed
Shaffer scored on a double by
Mellor.

OSU countered in the top of
the inning, scoring four runs on
one hit. The Cowboys took
advantage of two hit batters and
three wild pitches. The lone hit
was a three run homer by
Hardcastle which gave OSU a 5-
3 advantage.

The game continued back and
forth, with Pitt scoring a lone run
in the bottom of the fourth, fol-
lowed by six Cowboy runs in the
top of the ﬁfth. Aylor hit a two
run homer and Wyley Steelrnon

hit a solo homer for OSU, both.

off of Kramer, who came in for
Rohrbach. Bean came in and
closed out the inning for the
Panthers.

Pitt then scored four runs in the
bottom of the inning in a torren-
tial downpour, on a series of
walks and wild pitches.

The game was then suspended
and resumed Sunday afternoon.

With OSU up 15-9, the
Panthers mounted another come-
back in the eighth.

Murse walked to lead off the
inning. Womelsdorf followed

with a single, and Conti was hit
by a pitch. Already having left the
bases loaded three times in the
game, the Panthers looked to
DeBernardis for salvation. He

shut down the Panthers in the
ninth.

Pitt lost 15-13 in a game that
lasted four hours and 13 minutes
over two days. The two teams
combined for 30 hits.

It was also Pitt’s ﬁrst loss in a
game in which they scored over
seven runs.

Rohrbach’s record dropped to
8-4. Brook Holding (2-1) got the
win for the Cowboys.

“We got behind, and they hit
the longball against us,” said
Jackson. “They play for a big
inning, like our offense, but we
don’t have the power they have.

“If we could have got a rally
going in the ninth, we might
have had a chance to beat them,
but we didn’t do that.”

The Panthers closed out their
season with a new school record
of 39-16.

“We did better than any team
in the northeast [in the touma—
ment],” said Jackson. “It put us
on the map as being a solid base-
ball program, and hopefully it
will get us some respect.”

Tennessee defeated ‘Oklahoma
State 3-1 in the championship
game to advance to the College
World Series this week in
Omaha, Neb. They will join
other regional winners: Florida
State, Miami, Southern
California, Oklahoma, Cal. State
Fullerton, Clemson and either

Fortson — cross-town rival 3 

Duquesne was one of his ﬁnal
three choices, along with
Michigan and Cincinnati.

This new Convocation Center
would reap excellent beneﬁts for
the student body and faculty on
a first-hand basis. A lack of ade-
quate recreational areas in
Oakland means that anyone who
wishes to simply shoot some
hoops has to climb the hill and
face the crowds at the Fitzgerald
Field House and Trees Hall.

Also, varsity athletics take
precedent over intramurals here
at Pitt, and it is often virtually
impossible to get a game. This
problem could be solved if there
was a place just for varsity V
teams to practice and compete
that did not cut into the student
and faculty use.

I deﬁnitely see a pattern form-
ing ..

The opposition argues that we
do not need the ﬁnancial burden
that comes along with the
Convocation Center. Granted,
the initial cost of the center
would hurt the pocket, but the
long—tenn beneﬁts would be
priceless.

The addition of such a place
would give the campus another
center for student activity, draw
events not related to athletics
year-round and would generate
revenue for the entire communi-
ty for years to come.

Hopefully, within the next few
years this plan can be ironed out,
and Panther Paul can pack his
bags and ﬁnally live like a king.
