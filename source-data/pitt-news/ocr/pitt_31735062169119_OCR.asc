LaPietra'Maps Solution
To Univ-ersity’s Off-
Campus Housing Plight

by PAUL STOLLER
The ultimate solution to University’s problem concern-
off-campus housing, according to Jack LaPietra, chairman

. of the Student Government (SG) off-campus housing com-

mittee, is to procure University owned apartment buildings
in the Oakland area. LaPietra stated his beliefs at Satur-

day’s SG meeting. V

LaPietra stated that “landlords, will notin most cases,

lower their rents, improve the conditions of their dwellings,

to any significant extent, cease to ‘discriminate (those who

do discriminate), oribe forced
through com-petit-ion to offer any
particular . privileges to stu-
dents.” -

“Let us assume," said LaPie-
tra, “that Off-Campus Housing
cannot initiate any decisive ac-
tion on its own to greatly alter
the housing situation.” '

LaPietra’s conclusions reﬂect-
ing the Off-Campus housing
problem are the result of] an ex-
tensive survey of Oakland land-
lords. The survey was conduct-
ed by the members of SG’s Off-
Campus Housing Committee.

The survey was initiated in
late April with an article con-
cerning University Off-Camlpus
housing -that appeared in a local
Oakland newspaper and the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. After
this, the members of the Off-
Cam-pus Housing Committee cir-
culated questionnaires to a great‘
number of Oakland landlords.

Items on the questionnaire
ran-ged from the number of
rooms that were available for
rent to the fundamental ques-
tion of whether or not the re-
spective landlord Was interested
in renting rooms t-o students. In
the end, the survey was a suc-
cess, according to LaPietra.

LaPietra also made a statement
concerning the role of the Direc-

--tor of Off-Campus Housing. He

stressed that “the Director . .
must be available at all times to
receive students.” I >\

Group Allocation Requests

In a nine hour session Saturday, Student Government (SG) approved allocations of
$115,966 ‘to 40 student groups. It refused six recommendations of the Allocations Commit-

tee totalling $5925. The 45 requests considered were more than have ever been considered ,
by a Committee or the Senate.
This was the first time allocations to student groups were made‘ for a fiscal year.

Previous allocations were per term.
Twelve senators initially satin the SU Supper Room listening to recommendrtaions of the Al-
locations Committee. By '6:45 pm, when the meeting ended, seven senators remained. There are 25 sena-

tors, with 13 being a quorum.
Of the requests returned to the
Committee for reconsideration,
that of Associated Women Stu-
dents (AWS) caused the mo-st
debate. The total request was
for $8,500 with the Committee
recommending a $8,350. alloca-
tion. The senators objected to
giving funds to two speciﬁc
parts of the AWS request—$3'_75
for a Senior A-ssistant Retreat

and $4,000 for purchase of lan-
terns for Lantern Night.
The Retreat contended Sen.

Denni Rinovato, was for em-

ployees of the University and
should be paid for by the Dean
of Women's office. Other sena-
tors concurred. The Senate split
6-5 on allocating money for the
lanterns. The “nays” had the

margin. Since part of a request
cannot be passed or approved
by the Senate, the entire request
was returned.

The Allocations Committee
then recommended that AWS re-
ceive its requested funds minus
the Senate’s objections, since it

- would need funds ‘immediately

when the new ﬁscal year begins
Saturday. The Committee will
review the Retreat and lanrtern
request and submit another rec-
ommendation in the fall.

The Committee will also sub-
mit ~reoom-mendations ‘on the
other returned requests. (See
list printed below.)

Thecommittee had a total of .

$133,770 available for allocation.
The base sum for the year was
$126,000, but a. spring reserve of
$2,400 and a return from the
Student Union Board (SUB) of
$5,300 made up the difference.
The SUB returned funds came
from money allocated previous-
ly by the Committee and Senate
for a. spring term concert. The
funds were returned because of»
unavailability of entertainment,
time to plan the event, and lack
of students to attend.

The" Committee left a balance
of $11,879 to cover emergency
allocations over the next year.
In a "preliminary report, they
warned that it did not consider
this a large amount and thus
would review only the most ur-
gent emergency requests.

Page in —— THE PITT  — Tuesday, June" 27, 1967‘ A

The nine-hour Student Government (SG) Senate meeting Saturday
is a phenomenon that has not occurred since the days of SG President
Eric Stern’s brief but exciting regime. During that period, the Senators
counted on at least five or six hours for every meeting. Unfortunately,
the results from.the seemingly endless debates of that. era did not reflect
the time spent. Saturday’s SG session differed from the SG session of
two years ago in that important -respect: the "hours spent produced con-

‘. crete results. .

Forty-five requests were considered‘ by a now weary Allocations
Committee, as they met their responsibility to allocate funds for an entire
fi'scal year. After carefully evaluating the requests on the agenda, the
Senators present approved allocations of $115,966 to 40 student groups,
while refusing six recommendations totalling $5,925. '

We lament. that the Senate attendance was noticeably poor for this
vital session, as the maxi-mum number present was 12, with only seven
remaining for the entire meeting. No one called for a quorum, which
would have required 13 Senators, and the minority in attendance had the
unfair responsibility of tackling the massive task before them without
a majority of their colleagues present... _ A.

_ V The Senators were.‘ informed weeks in advance of this session, and
it is inexcusable that more of them did not make the effort. to participate.
By failing to respond, they have lost the opportunity to express their
thoughts on the most important piece of legislation to be discussed by
the Senate during this school year, one that concerns the activities of
every student organization that requested funds to operate.

 

A w...h,h.l.   my    

We must commend those Senators who did fulfill their obligation
and diligently evaluated the ‘numerous allocations on the agenda. The
issue that caused the most debate, the allocation for the Associated

Women Students (AWS), was decided wisely. The Senior Assistant Re-’ ,

treat, as correctly viewed by Senator Denni Rinovato, specifically served
girls who were “employed” by the University in a real sense, and should
be funded by the Dean of Women's Office. The $4000 request for lan-
terns had previously been met by the University, and must be differen-
tiated from the category of student activities. Lantern Night is a Uni-
versity tradition requiring the attendance of freshmen women and can-
not be equated with the other events that requested allocations, which
are sponsored and planned by students.

Although we are not in accord with every decision ‘made. by the

Allocations Committee, we must applaud them for doing a thorough job. 

Their task was an exhausting one, and the priorities they were forced
to establish was not an easy responsibility. It is difficult to- decide the
merits of one program as opposed to another, especially when so many
worthwhile agenda were presented. A value judgment has to be made
and tho-ugh we do not concur ‘with every choice, we feel that the Com-
mittee has not taken. its responsibility lightly.

We only wish that the majority of our SG Senators would give
their roles as representatives of our student body equal consideration
For there is no excuse for allowing a minority of our Senators to make
these. vital decisions, regardless of their qualifications. The students
chose 25 Senators and deserve to be represented by every one of them.

Expo 67

A Pi1grim’sProgress

EXPO ’67 is terriﬁc. Every-
thing from its bounteous
ﬂora to its bustling hot dog
stands exudes Expo’s metic-
ulous planning and bursting
excitement. They say that
experience is the best teach-
er, and those Expo officials

-— who witnessed Flushing’s de-

bacle in 1965 apparently

learned quite a bit of what '

not to do-.
Two man made islands
serve as Expo's grounds. Isle

St. Helene and Isle Notre

Dame host the national pa-
villions, the theme pavillions
(man and his World), and
La Ronde, a kid of Freedom-
land-Coney‘ Island revisited.
The three greatest c-rowd-
drawers are the national _pa-
villions of Russia, the Unit.-
ed States, and Czechoslova-
kia. The first is Ex_po’s big-
gest disappointment, the
next is its most controver-
sial, and the latter is by far
its ﬁnest. I imagine that the

man, Russians really are.

gineers. Reputedly Expo's

largest ediﬁce, and certainly
its most. abundantly stocked‘,
the Russian endeavor has
everythng except imagina-

tedious... For someone with
sore feet—not. an uncommon
malady at Expo —- the So-

trek from miniature hydro-

nation that could, if it want-

it would be bumptious folly,
the U.S. pavillion is. a very
clever attempt to extend to
the world a different View

The Legislators Stand Firm

A Step Forward

by Linda ‘Goldstein

THE’ CU RREN T’ clashes in, the State Legislature over
Gov. Raymond P. Shafer’s proposed budget for the next
fiscal year recalls unpleasant memories of one year ago.
At that time, everyone was pondering over whether our
University would receive its state-related status, and, if
so, would this be passed soon enough to reduce the tuition

/ for Pennsylvania residents from $1400 to $450.

Although we received a steady stream of verbal as-. 
surances that we would become a state-related university v "
before our Fall Term began, we were exposed to 3. seem-
ingly endless display of legislative maneuvering and a
reflusal to compromise that. almost lost the day for our
bi .

This year, too, the Legislature is once more haggling
over an issue, one that may not concern us as students but
does: concern us-as people residing in Pennsylvania. How-
ever, the Legislature is fortunately not repeating its. per-
formance of one year ago, for its leadership is now suc-
cessfully rising to its challenge. '

LAST YEAR, the obstructionists. lay within the legis-
lative body, but now both the Republican and Democratic .
elements are standing firm against Gov. Shafer’s record M);
budget. Surprisingly, the Governor’s Republican “allies”
refuse to echo his will. As our Legislature is usually
typed as a backroom operation with members knowm to
vote strictly along party lines, the Republican leadership
should be commended for publicly backing policies that
differ from the Governor's.

One man who has emerged as the leader of the day is
Rep. Herbert Fineman (D—-Philadelphia), the House Min-
ority Leader. Fineman cannot be accused of following the
conduct attributed to his predecessor, the then Majority
Leaderuloshua Eilberg, now a U.S. Congressmen. Eilberg
was continually accused of following the line espoused by
-the Philadelphia Democratic organization even at the ex-
pense of the people of Pennsylvania. Unlike Eilberg, Mr.
Fineman’s record clearly speaks for itself.

As stated in Sunday’ Pittsburgh Press, “Mr. Fineman
spent many 20-hour days comparing the new fiscal budgets
for each department with those from last year—and con-
cluded that. the Shafer Administration was attempting to
set up .a cushion for the next three years.” He estimated‘
that Shafer needs not the $267 million more he requested
but only $47 million. .

FINEMAN ALSO proposed a bill to abolish the De-
partment of Internal Affairs, which the people voted to
eliminate at the May 16 Primary. Shafer increased the ex-
penditures for this Department and intends to continue
it for another four years. He requested $2,259,341 for this
purpose, an increase of $311,529 over last year. Rep. Fine-
man’ bill to abolish the Department proposes to transfer
its necessary functions to other‘\departments, at a savings
of at least $1 million.

As The Press, Sunday editorial declared, Fineman’s
proposal represents “the kind of economy that can help
solve the budget problem.” And I might add, Rep. Fine-
man’ reso-urcef‘ul_ness and fine performance represents the
kind of leadership» that can hopefully produce a more .
independent State Legislature. which will effectively f ulfill 
its responsibility, to serve the people of Pennsylvania‘.- A it

Pennsylvania, Ohio and New
York. We also have accepted a
very lucrative invitation from
the University of Colorado to
visit them at Boulder, Colo., next
November for 12 additional de
bates."

The debaters receive their top-
ic in August in order to prepare
for the tour, which starts in
October. Kane said that the _top-
less are -generally those of inter-
est to the high school student
so that the debates would be
“well accepted.” He recalls, how-
ever, an incident when one high
school cancelled its debate when
the principal found out that the
topic was to be Vietnam. “I
guess they didn’t want the stu-
dents’ views disturbed.”

Most of the time, though, “the
assembly debates serve as an
educational tool for the high
school students. Many teachers
focus their problems of demo-
cracy unit on Vietnam or NATO
or some other debatable issue
around our visit and the stu-
dents have the opportunity to
hear both sides of the problem.”
Kane also commented that “in
addition to the debate tours,
WPDU sponsors a tournament

1:-ary, which includes up to 21
states.”

The tournaments and the tours
bring about “close ties with
high schools.” Kane emphasized

that “people hear about Pitt this '

way. VVhen we missed a certain
high school one year because ’of
a snow storm, the admissions
office reported that the applica-
tions went down in one area.
For this reason, the office of ad-
missions has given our program
a great deal of support. I am
glad that Pitt recognizes debate
as it does. There is a great deal
of admirationfor Pitt national-
ly. We came -in third in the na-
tional tournamen .”

Kane wishes to continue the
system that Dr. Newman start-
ed .by which anyone who wishes
to join WPDU may do so with
little or no trouble. The -sys-
tcm “handicaps Pitt, since it is
not as competitive as other uni-
versities, yet our system pro-
vides more opportunity for more
people. There is a spirit in

. WPDU that makes it more than

a club. More than in most col-
leges, the Debate Union works
for the good of the University
studen .”

A favorite project of Kane is
an exchange program with the

University of West Indies. “In
the first part of January they
visit us, and in the last part of
January, we visit them. The pro-
gram was established through a
contact of Dr, Newman in the
West Indies. Debate there is an
every day part of life; instead
of a company bowling team,
there is a debate team. Each
year we debate at the town of
Manddeville, and we are given
national coverage. The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is well known
in the Islands.”

WPDU also sponsors three
tournaments for colleges, Kane
related. “The second weekend in
October, students from Cam-
bridge debate American stu-

dents. In December, P-itt spon-
sors debates from 45 -colleges,
mostly American. A debate week-
end for novices takes place the
second weekend in March.
Kane stated that the Debate
Un-ion’s innovations have helped
increase its stature. “It is one
of the few debate societies that
has public debates. I hope to ex-
pand the number of public de-
bates to once a month, Next

year We will have Cambridge‘

and the University of the Paci-
fic.” K-ane noted that the Uni-
versity sometimes usesthe “Ox-
ford style, which employs less

‘evidence than the American
style. It’s an innovation which
helps Pitt.”

‘Pitt News’ Review

  Central Park . July   20

by ROBERT L. HOROWITZ

It was not the kind of evening
one would go for a walk in Cen-
tral Park, no less sit in an open-
air theatre waiting for a pro-
duction of Shakespeare to begin.
Rain had been predicted, and
the overcast sky had already
rumbled its warnings to the
wary. But there I was, feeling

-more a part of Shakespeare’s

Comedy of Errors than aspec-
tator.

My friend had been waiting in
line since 5 o'clock in order to
get good “free” tickets/for the
show. The procedure is “ﬁrst
“ﬁrst come ﬁrst served.” My
friend and I were one of the ﬁrst
in line; our seats were in the
front row center.

By 8 o'clock the theatre was
ﬁlled, ﬁve minutes later the
‘show began.‘The director and
actors worked together ~to—pre-
sent one of the most enjoyable
productions of The Comedy of
Errors I’ve seen.

After a storm at sea, baby
twin masters and baby twin ser-
vants are separated from each
other—-one master and one ser-
vant were rescued by one city

- and one master and one servant

were rescued by another city.
The crux of the play deals with‘
the misadventures that occur
when the twins are, unbe-
knownst to them, in the same
city at the same time—-one mas-
ter and servant as visitors, and
one master and servant as resi-
dents. The humorous confusion
that results when the town peo.
ple mistake one set of twins for

the other is magniﬁcently han-
dled by the Shakespeare in the
Park Company.

Softly at ﬁrst, then harder
and harder the rain began to
fall during the -performance.
Soon the management stopped
the action, asking the audience
to wait for the rain to stop be-
minutes passed, the rain contin-
1'ore continuing the play Fifteen
ued to fall. Many- members of
the audience left. A few valiant
die-hard theatre goers held off
against‘ natures wet onslaug-hut.

The audience began clapping;
randomly at ﬁrst, then more or-
ganized. As if in answer to the
audiences demands the rain
abated. The actors continued the
play from where they left off.
Unfortunately the rain began
again.

 

The lights were turned off;
the actors continued perform-
ing. The audience oheered their
appreciation of the actors drive.
Finally, THEY became more ad-
ament and the actors stopped
the performance. The audience
had already -moved from their
seats to. stand around the stage.
Each of us in that little out-door
theater felt something deep in
our .hearts that was wonderful.
There we were drenched from
the unconquerable“ rain, hud-
died togetherfcheering wildly.
Actors and audience members
em-braced one another, each
wanting the other to stay and
ﬁnish the play together. Then
out of the dark rain came a
voice: “I can see those idiots
waiting in the rain to see a ball
game, but -to get pneumonia for
Shakespeare——‘God --help them.”
