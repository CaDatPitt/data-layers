Wherein We Resume
Our Discussion

On Charles M. Veacli

By MILTON G. LEHMAN, JR.
One of the most unusual print,

.job orders inithe history of

Pittsburgh printers was that

placed by Charles Morris Veach

of the Charles Morris Veach

Foundation, noted here the other

day, for a several thousand copy
publication of World’s Headlight.

According to a publication no-
tice on page one: “This publica-
tion was ﬁrst formed to be a
newspaper, but its sole purpose
being to portray the most funda-
mental thin.gs of Earth—it has sur-
rendered its premises to the
Veach Foundation as such; and
will have no speciﬁc time of issue.
Price 25 cents.”

“Here, take a couple hundred of
them,” Charles Morris Veach in-
structed us. “The price doesn’t
mean anything. It’s a joke.”

We took three ‘Won-ld’s Head-
lights, settled down comfortably,

A and began supplying punctuation,

to the Veach ‘monologue. Mr.

Veach declared:

'“You see why people aren’t
ready for my invention. People
try to hitch up my machine next
to old machines, and expect it to
work. The only way you can get
the Veach machine to work is to
throw out all the other old ma-
chines. Do you understand?”

We did not, so we agreed that
we did. The conﬂagration spread.

_TI_u-own-To The Air
- “Here. _ It’s all explained in
here,” Charles Morris Veach de-
clared, waving about a copy of the
Headlight. ‘ “It’s all in here. Just
you read this. Take a hundred
with you and read .them, and you’ll
understand. what it’s all about.
I’m going to print 25,000,000 of
them, so everyone will know what
it’s all about)’ f
We believe he will. He has al-
ready broadcast several lectures,i
reprinting. them under the cap-
tion: “Lecture by Veach Thrown
to the Air,:over, WFBG and WJEJ
Radio Stations, Altoona, Pa., Ha-
gerstown_,.. Maryland.” -_ He, offered
KDKA ‘a certiﬁed check to “throw
a few broadcasts” over the pioneer
station, ‘but=was rejected because
he would ,_not permit his lectures
to be__censored. . I

Mr. Veach’s invention, he tells
us __as we gasp nervously, “is a
force to destroy Wall Street’s Bias
circumventing the Common Man.”

He draws an analogy in the
Headlight" using a Big Tree and
Little Tree to represent Wall
Street and Veach, respectively.
He illustrates it with cartoons. In
the ﬁrst sketch, the tree, resemb-
ling an overgrown mushroom, is
ballooned: “I am Wall Street the
Big Tree and Little Trees can not
Grow Under Me.”

A little tree, labeled “Veach,” is
commencing to grow beneath the
shade of. the big one, giving the
lie to the boast. In the third car-
toon, the Veach tree, grown large
by a “new principle of Mathemat-
ics and Physics, Sir,” declares:
“Thou, I Little Tree, take unto
thyself legs and run away for, 10,
bug eats bug, dog eats dog, and
hence the survival of the fittest.”

Explanation

On page ten, with six pages to
go, Mr. Veach settles down to the
question: “Do You Know.What
Veach Is Up To? If You Do Not
Know—Here Is The Key.” The
key explains:

Afternoon

Men’s Health
Service Moves

To (Cathedral

In a ﬁnal day eﬁort to pass
the 2,000 mark in Tuberculin
tests and to enable men who

haven’t had time to go to Falk:

Clinic, the men’s student health
service will move up to the Ca-
thedral from 9 to 3 o’clock today,
according to Dr. H. C. Carlson,
director of the men’s student
health service.

At the end of last week’s test-‘’

ing period, exactly 1,905 students
had taken the free Tuberculin Tu-
berculosis-detection tests being of-
fered by the student health service
in cooperation with The Pitt
News. I .
BEGIN THIS MORNING

Women’s tests have been given
all weekgandwwill conclude today
along with the men’s tests.

From 9 o’clock, this _. morning

(until 3 o’clock this afternoon, Dr.

Carlson and Dr. Paul Zehfuss will
administer testsin Room 144, the
evening students’ lounge, in the
Cathedral.

. Women’s tests, administered by

day today. » .
This will be the last time Tu.-

the University this year, All tests
are free, and if positive reactions
result, the health services have
made. arrangements with Falk
Clinic to. offer students X—ray
photos, ordinarily costing from $10
to $15, a $2 rate, -less than the cost
of the plate itself. , V
, MOVE fro CATHEDRAL ,
, The moving of the men’s health
service, it is believed, to the Ca-.
thedral will enable those students
who aretoo busy to walk to Falk
Clinic, to take the tests. Actual
administration of the test-takes
something less than a half minute.
“This will be your ﬁnal oppor-
tunity to take this most important
of health tests,” said.a joint state-
ment released by the student
health services yesterday. “It will
be impossible for us to give these
tests beyond today since Tubercu-
lin materials must be prepared in
mass, and it is impractical to of-
fer individual tests.

Wu, 4 Pans I Show

Says Cooper

By DICK COOPER,

Publicity Manager, Cap and Gown

After plugging ‘Pickets, Please!”
in every amenable newspaper in
western Pennsylvania as the most
rollicking, most hilarious show in
the history of Cap and Gown, for
the past two months, I shudder at
being responsible for such gross
inisrepresentation. Written around
an idea supplied by Robert Saffron
and Nick Spanos, “Picket, Please!”
provided not'one little rollick ‘dur-
ing ,the entire Monday evening
performance. .

i This does not mean that it is not
a good show. In fact I think, that,
minus the gags,
it is swell. Cap
and Gown can
well dispense
hilarity for one
year, ; whether
the change be .
intentional o r--
not, to .. take a
few playful jabs
at the passing
scene; and this it
does :with re-
markable success.

football past, Dante Dalle-Tezze as
Bellini provedto‘ have lot more

few self-conscious minutes in the
ﬁrsttact, he straightened out to
make the perfect buffer for his
minister of propaganda, V Jack
Hoeveler, who , turned in the
smoothest, if not the most inspir-
ed, ‘performance of the entire cast.
, Prince Bill Gibsonand Princess
Bill Vaughen were high-normal,
as "Cap and Gown juvenile leads
go, having some difficulty in put-
tingtheir songs across. The luck-
iest bit of casting was that of‘ Al-
bertiBarr, who made the unhap-
py little king of Asphyxia_the only
clear« characterization of the
show. i A I ' '
, The appearance of Bill Murray
and Sidney-Shore as the Twaddle
twins, female international spies,

. with their thoid -avenue accent and

seductive hips, served more than
once as -the ;needed’ shot" of :ad-
renalin in an otherwise dull scene.
Again,..the l.oveliness of Billl-loev—
eler and the‘ amazing. femininity
of Leo Cafferty. as Minnie McTish
and Burtie Burtz go a, long way
to justify such things as Cap and
Gown.  I ~ . . —

erably better «than average, both

inuthei cleverness of the routine

and in the_footwo_rk_ ofgthe gboys
themselves. "Tops in ‘effectiveness
are dictator number, in which the
chorus wears Hitler and — Mus-

solini masks, and the “I’m N0
Dummy” number, in which life-

sized dummies are tossed around
as dancing partners. _‘ The May-
pole dance, making a really beau-
tiful scene,’ brought the greatest
applause from the audience.’ ,

However, and this is important, if the bill.
fails, it means another Congressional crack at
the Roosevelt administratioii——a second Su-

It is for this reason that the anti-Roosevelt

The one nice thing about being a columnist is
that you can write about your ti‘avels——if any. For
instance, I just spent a whole week—c-nd going to
Washington (D. C.), being in I/Vasliingtoii, and com-
ing back from Washington and if you think you’re
going to get away without hearing about it, Ayou’d
better turnthe page now. A

Of course, it probably won’t be like Mrs. Parry’s
New York columns.

By her non-intervention policy,
England in reality aided the in-

reward for her generosity. «Again,
however, the reward will probably
be economic rather than political.

‘France and? Russia, ’ having
backed the wrong horse, can ex-

the spoils, but this fact in itself’
will strengthen the bonds between
those two powers. In fact, "France .

You’ll excuse me if I havel
that down—in-the-mouth feeling,

but I just came back from the
front lines. Monday was one
of thoserdays that just wasn’t
‘ours. Everything went wrong.

It used to be one of my theo-
ries that the team that went out
with the most ﬁght, and what is
known, psychologically, as the
will toiwin, was the team that was
certain to get the breaks.

‘But, now I’m afraid that I’m
disillusioned again. At ‘least, to-
‘ day I am‘ skep-
tical.

T h e r e was

Lowe Handicapped

_ By the‘ time that hockey game
came along, I realized that my ap-
prehensions were‘ -justiﬁable. ' It
just wasn’t_ our night- Everything
went wrong, I .

In the ﬁrst quarter, Schooley
scored a goal on a beautiful angle
shot. That part was alright. But.
there was a clean chance to score
another goal. The bad luck turn-
ed up in the fact that the only man
who was in the position to do it
was Bob Lowe, ‘playing with a
‘broken -bone‘ is his hand. He
'wasn’t able to maneuver the stick
around to push the puck past that
hulk of a goalie that guarded Car-
:r0ll’s nets because of the injured
hand, even though he was out in
‘the Wide open. ‘

Then, as the team came off the
icefor the intermission rest at the
end of the ﬁrst period, it was
found that the Garden manage‘-
ment had misplaced the key to the
Pitt dressing room, so the team
had to sit around in the under-
ground tunnel, trying to get some
‘relaxation before the key was
located.

The death blow came in the ﬁ-
nal period’ when the two Pitt
stars, Bob ‘Schooley on the wing,
and Lenny Broido on defense,
were slapped down on the ice with
torn ligaments. Schooley’s was an
over-extension of the ligaments
in the elbow and Broido’s came in
the shoulder. Both were elimin-
ated from the series play.

McSorley Listens

In face of all this gallant Pitt
team didn’t give up ﬁghting. With
the score, 4-1, Dick Friday was
still sckatingraway at his furious-
est, trying to score a goal as the
game ended.’

Mcsorley was ordered to stay in
his bed, but he was still in there
giving everything. He made an
arrangement"‘with Johnny Harris
by which he had a loud—speaker
set up in ‘the Pitt dressing room.
During the time-outs he talked "to
his team by‘ a telephone ‘hook-up.

By JIM DAILEY

“Calamity” hit Pitt ’s hockey
team last Monday ‘night, at Du-
quesne Garden when they lost
to John Carroll’s Blue Streaks,
4-1, in the ﬁrst game of tl1e‘Col-
legiate league play-oifs.

Late in this period Arsenault
picked up ‘a loose puck from in
front of his own nets while the
whole Panther team was in Car-
roll territory; skating the length
of the ice witha clear ﬁeld, he
hastily beat Ellis for the ﬁnal
marker. ~ — .

Therewasn’t any doubt that Pitt
was outplayed in the last two
quarters,"but there might still be
a diﬁerent story if some of the
smooth Pitt plays had gotten past
Ryan. The boys in the press box
commented favorably one time in
particular.

POVVER DRIVE

“Tate” Brittain worked the puck
through Arsenault and passed un-
der the defense to Schooley in
back of the Carroll net. Schooley
held the puckifor a split second
and fed it back to Brittain at the
mouth of the net. ' Goalie Ryan
came out and caught Brittain’s
shot with his skates, barely avert-
ing a goal.

Late in the third period Pitt, on
a power play with five men in
front of the Carroll net, took at
least ten shots at Ryan who had
the luck of the gods- at times.

TURNER SPEAKS

In commenting on his placing
the News first in the contest, col-
umnist Allen said: “I gave The
Pitt News ﬁrst place because of its
consistent featuring of future
news events on page one. Most
papers __give play space..to events
several days old. In giving the
play to coming events, the editors
of The Pitt News grasped the most
fundamental tenet of alert news-
papering.. The paper also had ex-

tion . . . ”

Clean p pets  Depression
Continues Because‘ Government,

Big Business para-te

-rim rrrr News

As long‘ as the “cat and dog¢

ﬁght” between business and the
Roosevelt administration contin-’
ues, the present depression is like-
ly to continue, declared Dr.-
Charles “ Tippetts, dean of the:

13.
School of Business Administration;

; in his address Monday at Inquiry

Forum. , .
Blaming the - administration,
business, and labor alike for pres-
ent. conditions, Dr. Tippetts main-
tainedthat the country is now in
the midst of a real depression.

- Recovery will come, he claimed,

only when businessmen feel con-
ﬁdent about the future.

“This talk about ‘conﬁdence’ has
been greatly overemphasized, but
it has something to do with the
situation. If we are going to have
the kind of recovery which will be
permanent, then we must have a
condition in which individual bus-
inessmen. have a feeling. of conﬁ-
dence to go ahead with a certain
amount of safety,” Dr. Tippetts

ate in restoring conﬁdence by eas-
ing up on its program of reform
and regulation of business, but

businessmen must also stop at-

tacking the administration and
spreading a “fear psychology,” he
said.

“The time has come to call a_

halt on any of these reform meas-

ures that scare people,” asserted

Arts Galleries Show
:Mexican Photographs  

By NORMAN GIBSON

* Samples of both the Old and
New Mexicos have been caught in
the 40 photographs by Donald R.
Laidig and George E. Fischer
which form the current exhibi-
tion inthe department of ﬁne arts
galleries, seventh ﬂoor, Cathedral.

The majority of the pictures,
done in the ordinary two-tone
combination, show interesting use
of lighting effects. Deep shadows
are often contrasted with bright
sunlight reﬂecting from colorful
stone walls. The artistshave, in
general,- attained a soft atmos-
phere in their camera studies.

More than half of the pictures
aregivene over to architectural
subjects. The large brightly-col-
ored dome, typical of the old
Mexican churches is shown’ in the
picture “Dome of the Church and
Convent of}.N.uestra Senora.” Ris-
',ing from an jfo-ctagonal ‘tower, the
’dome'f' is ’i1A'decorated.;-,w/ith _ a Isimple
design ;{denfe_‘_w’1th ,‘;s_iha11 titles.

' The‘ ,i‘nﬁiienceTo'f ,A-Spanish <Bar-
oque‘ arA,chitecturAé,’f,_with its scrolls,

‘walls, aiid. f.,,itw‘b'-tovned , stone is

.A
—v

shown in “Church of -La Santa
Veracruz,” and especially in “Con-
secrated Corner” which shows a
type of cross peculiar to colonial
churches in Mexico.

One of the most interesting of
the architectural group is “The
Parish Church” which with its
broken walls, deserted court yard,
and very old laurel trees, has the
romance of Old Spain.

Of the pictures stressing people
as subjects, “Siesta Hour,” and
“Noonday” are the best. The for-
mer has caught the atmosphere of
humid air ‘and glaring sun, and
the woman hurrying across the
street displays a most unusual ex-
ample of the camera as a medium
of art. In “Noonday,” the straw
in the foreground suggests a con-
fusion which permeates the whole
picture. In this picture the artists
have caught motion. »—

But in most of their ~ picture,
they have taken merely documen-
tary, sympathetic photographs,
leaving out much of the activity

and Iifeof-the people. Asa group,’ '

Special Correspondent

CHAPELHAILL, N. C., April 6—
Six members of Men’s~Debating

Association arrived here this

morning from Washington, D. C.,
for a discussion of - the NLRB
question with a debate team from

the University of North Carolina.‘

Defending the aﬂirmative of the
Pi Kappa Delta proposition, “Re-
solved: that the National Labor
Relations Board should be em-
powered to enforce arbitration in
all industrial disputes,” in this
evening’s debate are Saul Dizen-
feld, C39, and Bernard McKenna',
C39. V

The Pittsburgh delegation also
includes William Stark, C38, Ed-
ward Springer, C3'9; Hyman Rich-
man, C39; and Charles W. Lomas,
debate coach.

Last evening University teams-

debated representatives from the
American University YMCA of
Washington, D. C. Richman and
SpriAnger discussed the negative of
the NLRB question with a two-
man law school team from Amer-
ican University before an enthusi-
astic audience which included sev-
eral Congressmen.

At the YMCA, Stark and Dizen-
feld led the debate on the question,
“What type of unionism is best
suited to American industry?”
They advocated the industrial
union type of the CIO, while the
YMCA team preferred the craft
union idea. ,
