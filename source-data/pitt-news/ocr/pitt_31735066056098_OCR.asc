Racism, bigotry,
oppression main

focus of cultural 

diversity seminar

By Chisma Giles
and Monika Colbert
The Pitt News

Even though last night’s Diversity Sensitivity
Performance got off to a late start, the program leaders
emotions on racism, oppression and bigotrywere not
dampered.

“Feel angry, sad, happy, enraged. I don’t care, I
just want you to feel something._ Don’t think!
Don’t judge,” said program leader and Resident
Director Ed Crist as he. was trying to get everyone to
“conjure up some feeling” about the struggles students
have. I

“I «as really tired of people judging things, thinking
about things [and saying], ‘That’s right. That’s wrong.
T hat’s good. T hat’s bad.’ While that’s a part of a process
[leading to racism and bigotry], it’s not where it starts.
The whole idea of bigotry and oppression and hatred
and racism starts here,” Crist said while pointing to his
heart. .

Kishma DeCastro, one of last night’s speakers,
defined prejudice as “hostilegor unreasonable feelings
based on fears, mistrust, ignorance, misinformation or a
combination thereof.”

Shealso defined culture as “the subtotal of ways of
living includes values, beliefs, standards, linguistic
expressions, patterns of thinking and styles of cornmu-
nication with groups.”

Movies, music, poetry and speeches were the compo-
nents used by the Cultural Diversity Committee to
get its ideals across. .

The movie clips shown dealt with all types of racism.
Scenes from movies like D0 The Right Thing and Sclaool
Ties, which illustrate black/white relations and anti-
Semitism, were used to make students more aware of
the stereotypical beliefs they harbor.

Pauses in between clips were filled with speeches
and poetry by student committee members. Each
speech served as a means to educate students about
various cultures.

Emerging Leader facilitator Mart Evans brought his
group to the Diversity Sensitivity Performance “to
expose them to all the groups and viewpoints on carn-
pus.”

Other students came out on their own.

‘Colleen Shotwell said she came “to leam to see differ-
ent views and to learn people’s views on certain issues.
Also, to try to be open-minded about things.”

Student Bridget Lee said she came “to see how the .

GPSA looking into graduate student housing at Pitt

By Karen Ferry
For The Pitt News

The lack of graduate student
housing at Pitt is among the
Graduate and Professional
Student Association's main goals
for this and future years.

Last night at its first meeting
of the year, it voted to form a
housing committee to address
this problem.

-Plans for the committee will
begin with a mailing to all grad-

uate students to survey their
housing needs.

“The university just built
Sutherland Hall‘, and they have
a shuttle service for it, and they
have the Towers, and all the
other dorms for undergrads 
the amount of housing for grad-
uate students compared to
undergraduates is pathetic,”
said GPSA President Steve
Parks.

The new housing committee
will be looking into married and

domestic partner housing for
graduate students.

“It’s appalling that a school of
this size and caliber isn’t com-
mitted enough to provide grad-
uate students with housing on
or near campus,” committee
Chairperson Jerome Crowder
said. ’

“Ruskin Hall is the only pseu-
do-graduate student housing
facility.here,” said member
Colleen Ring. GPSA members
said that Ruskin Hall’ is mainly

for dental students.

“It’s just a crime that graduate
students don’t have housing,”
Ring said.

In other business:

-GPSA voted to expand its
newsletter into a. newspaper
and hire an editor. '

-Free legal service to gradu-
ate students is within the budget
this year, as well as money for
the student travel and research
fund program which is new this
year. GPSA members said it is

being created so graduate stu-
dents can go to conferences and
do the research they need to do.

“There isn’t a whole lot of
money to do dissertations and
things, and this will be a way to
help with that,” Parks said.

The GPSA has a lot of pro-
grams solidly in place this year,
said Parks. “V/e’re meeting
needs and expanding on them.
We became strong last year, but
this year we’re really taking
off.”

People commonly think of an
alcoholic family as a family with
an alcoholic in it, rather than

‘ realizing that the entire family

has learned to function in a sys-
tem of addiction and denial.
Alcoholism is a family disease,
in which to some degree or
another, all members of the
family are affected. This disease
is “the gift that keeps giving” —
it is multigenerational. Members
acquire the characteristics of the
disease even though many of
them may never pick up a
drink.
Living in an alcoholic home
is like living in a house with
anelephant in the living room.

‘ Sometimes the elephant is lov-

ing, funny and pleasant to
be around. Then, without warn-
ing, it loses control. Everyone
in the family works carefully
to quiet the elephant and
feels responsible for its behav-
ior. However, no one talks
about what its like or acknowl-

Former
NY Mayor

Ed Koch F

to lecture

I By Wendy Parkhouse

For The Pitt News

Ed Koch, former New
York City mayor, will
address students on
issues of- race, unemploy-
ment and AIDS tonight,
according to Tony Josato
of the Pitt Program
Council. ‘

“Koch will also speak
about current politics,"
said Josato, PPC lecture
committee chair. “This
will include the first por-
tion of the Clinton admin-
istration.”

Josato. said ticket sales
were low so far but he
said that “Pitt students
seem to be procrastina-
tors,” and he hoped off-
campus sales would go
up after Koch’s radio
appearance on KDKA.

Koch was mayor of
New York from 1978 to
1989. When elected into
office, New York City was
on the brink of bankrupt-
cy and Koch is credited
with creating an effective
recovery plan.

Koch gave approxi-
mately 40 to 50 lectures to
corporations and colleges
all over the United States
in his first year out of
office, according to the
April 25, .1990 issue of
New Yor/e.

Koch provides radio
and television commen-

. taries and wrotea book,
A All the Best, Letters From

a Feisty Mayor.

Josato said he had been
searching for an early
September speaker and
Koch had “caught his
eye.”Funds received from
the student activities fees
of all the College of Arts
and Sciences, College of
General Studies and most
graduate students will be
used to pay for this lec-
ture which will cost
$10,000 to $15,000,
according to Josato.

Koch will speak at
8p.m. in the Union
tonight.

Pitt's five—year face—lift plans start to cement

By Tom" Schneider
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s
ongoing face—lift gained
momentum Tuesday as expan-
sion plans were discussed by
the University Board of
Trustees’ Property and Facilities
Committee.

At the meeting, the committee
reviewed current construction
projects as well as new propos-
als, all a part of the university’s
five-year building plan. The top-
ics discussed included branch
campus renovations, a new
.medical science building, an
update on the convocation cen-
ter and a first look at the
Iroquois Development Project.

“We were a little more ambi-
tious when we started, but [the
expansion projects] arelmoving
along in a reasonable fashion,”
said Associate Vice Chancellor
of «Facilities lvlanagement L.
Thomas Hussey. ’,

The Iroquois development,
still in the early stages, would
be located on Forbes Avenue,
bounded by Meyran Avenue
and Atwood Street, where the
present‘ Iroquois Building
resides. \

According to Ronald J.
Forsythe, vice _ president of the

University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, it is proposed to include
237,000 square feet of office
space, as well as a 572-car
underground garage. The devel-
opment will also create several
new storefront properties,
adding to those already lining
Forbes.

If and when completed, the
Iroquois development will
house the School of Health and
Rehabilitation Sciences,
Forsythe said. ’ '

Also discussed was a proposal

for a new medical science facili-

ty that would be added on to
the Biomedical Science Tower.

The 200,000 square foot facili-
ty will make Pitt’s», biomedical.
complex the largest of its kind
in the country, said Director of
Facilities Management Ana
Guzman. Completion of the
project is slated for December
of 1995.

At Pitt’s branch affiliates in
Johnstown, Bradford
Titusville, reconstruction is
adding acre upon acre to their
individual campuses. ’

According to Hussey, Pitt-
Johnstown has already begun a
$22 million reconstruction pro-
ject that will produce several
new residence halls, improved
athletic facilities and plenty. of

According to Guzman, the
preferred site for the location of

tion center would adjoin it to

Field House. A walkway would
also be created to link the con-
vocation center and Trees Hall,
thus creating a large complex
connecting Pitt’s four major ath-
letic facilities.
In addition, the convocation

center and Pitt Stadium would '

share a concourse level which
will include concession areas

ESC starts plans for October job fair

By Kelly A. Hanna
For The Pitt News

General Motors, IBM and
Honda Motors Corporation are
just a few companies planning
on attending the Engineer
Student Council-sponsored job
fair in October. A

“I can’t understand why
everyone wouldn’t be planning
to attend this job fair. This is the
way to actually meet the people
that do the hiring,_ rather
than just sending in your
résuméf’ job fair Chairperson
Erin Lilley said at yesterday’s
ESC meeting.

On Oct. 23, the ESC is spon-
soring an Interviewing Skills
Seminar. Kevin Collins,
the head of Pitt’s job placement
department, and a representa-
tive from Westinghouse
Corporation will be speaking.

“We feel that it’s real impor-
tant to offer as much academic
support as we can,”
said ESC President Jeanette
Johnson. .

However, academic support
is not the only function of
the ESC. The group has‘ al-
ready organized a white water
rafting trip for this Saturday
and a Pirates game for Sun-

day.

In addition, it is organizing
a Halloween hayride with the
School of Nursing in order to
mix the two groups.

Also, the,ESC is rafﬂing Les I

Miserables tickets for a dollar
and organizing the installation
of acampus phone in Benedum
Hall. -

Johnson and Vice President

Tom Webster are both very
excited about the upcoming
school year.

Study

Continued from page 1
the world partaking in the
study.

“Usually with Type 1 dia-
betes, the onset occurs during
adolescence and it is necessary
that the patient take daily injec-

tions of insulin for the rest of his‘

or her life,” said Rick Jones,
research coordinator for the
study.

The current types of insulin
available come close to mimick-
ing what a normal person’s pan-
creas would do.

“Normally when a person
eats, his or her blood sugar
rises. The pancreas detects the
rise and sends out fast-acting
insulin to break down the sugar.
This then can control the blood
sugar from one to two hours
after a meal. At the same time, a
small amount of long-acting

insulin is also sent out to control -

the blood sugar from three to 10
hours later,” explained Jones.

Currently on the ‘market, the
fastest acting insulin is known
as Regular and it takes 30 min-
utes for it to activate. “I would
have to wait a half-hour before I
could eat or else my blood
sugar would be imbalanced,”
said Tom Anderson, one of the
25 participants in the Pittsburgh
study.

“With LYSPRO, a diabetic’s
body can mimic a normal per-
son’s breakdown process,” said
Jones. “LYSPRO is identical to
Regular insulin except for two
amino acids, numbers 28 and
29, Lysine _and Proline. They
switched locations on the 1nole—

cule and now the body can

absorb the insulin six times
faster than before.”

After taking an injection of
LYSPRO, a person can eat with-
in five minutes instead of wait-
ing. This gives the person over-
all better control of their blood
sugar.

“Helping prevent the short-
term side effects will help con-
trol the long—term effects,” said
Jones. “And when a diabetic is
feeling well, he or she is more
compliant with therapy.”

The study is now coming to a
close and the researchers hope
to have LYSPRO approved by
the Food and Drug
Administration within 14
months. _

“The study seems to have
been a success, and we would
like to have the drug out on the
market as soonas possible,”
Jones said.

Anderson said, “With
LYSPRO, I feel that the conve-
nience has been put back in my

life.”

Educate

It is becoming harder for many Americans to meet
their living expenses every year. This is a surprise to no
one.

Inﬂation rises every year but Americans just aren’t
earning enough to keep up with the increases. ‘

A group of Americans that are being affected by these
rough economic times, and are very often not men-
tioned either by public officials or the media, are col-
lege students. '

A report released this week by the College Board

states that the cost of higher education continues to .

outpace income, inﬂation» and ﬁnancial aid, whether it

be from state, federalor other sources.
This news is quite alarming considering that, accord- _

ing to the Department of Education’s National Center
for Education Statistics, the most recent figures show
that of the roughly 12 million undergraduates nation-
wide, about 44 percent of them receive some form of
financial aid. ,
' It is evident that a significant number of college stu-
dents in America today are unable to meet their
expenses, either from the help of their parents or them-
selves. .Not many American families are making enough
money to offset the yearly increase in prices. According
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, consumer prices rose
5.4 percent in 1990.

There are not many middle—class Americans, let alone

the lower class,’ who received that high of a raise that '

year .

At the University of Pittsburgh the situation looks
even worse. According to telefact, over 70 percent of
students atthis university depend on some form of aid
or another. ' l

The Associated Press reports a ‘dwindling number of
potential college students in America. The inability to
pay for college due to tuition increases, the fact that
financial aid «cannot meet students’ needs and because
America’s work force is not earning enough every year
to meet rising costs are all directly related to this unfor-
tunate situation. '

For a nation that claims to pride itself on its educa-
tional system, it is evident that not enough is being
done to support it.

A first step is one that President Clinton has already
begun to undertake. His plan would allow potential
college students to work in some public service capaci-
ty for a few years" in compensation for the money "bor-
rowed to receive an education. The proposal will not
only offer more opportunity to those who want to go to
college and cannot, but it will also benefit society
tremendously. . ' ' ' - -

’ Finally, universities such as Pitt need to scrutinize its
budgets and look for ways to reallocate funds. Wasteful
spending has to cease. It’s about time university admin-

- istrations realized that priority number one is to educate

America — not to make money.

Negation of others not solution

Given the historic and current assaults on the
image and identity of African Americans in the
larger social context, the desire to promote pride
and self-image among African-American students
at Pitt is understandable. But some of the recent
activities and statements of the Black Action
Society require a close examination by all mem-
bers of the campus community. Particularly trou-
bling is a pattern of trying to create unity by
denying the diversity of opinion within the black
student body and the attempt to achieve self-affir-
mation through the negation of others.

Black unity should not occur at the expense of
black diversity. Unity requires a recognition of the
diversity within the African—American community
itself. We come from many differ-

they promote the same kind of "ignorance and
stereotypesthat have been used against blacks by
others; Just as bad, and possibly worse, they
divert the attention and the energies of the
African—American community away from its great-
est challenge, the challenge to make real and sub-
stantive strides toward constructive self-help and
self-empowerment.

Appealing to bigotry may be an effective emo-
tional release, but it is also cheap and cowardly. It
does not require much thought or initiative. What
is needed is to take the more difficult road of
directly and creatively confronting some of the
self-destructive activities within our own commu-
nities from black-on-black crime to the need to

' encourage younger blacks to

ent backgrounds, from Harlem to
the Caribbean, from rural
Mississippi to the inner-city of
Chicago. We have a variety of
experiences, and we possess dif-
ferent points of view. ‘While we

pursue a formal education and to
assist them in the full develop-
ment of their talents and their
skills. These are the challenges
that would be worthy of an orga-
nization that claims to be inter-

have all experienced racism in its
various forms, we have developed
different strategies to destroy it. Moreover,
African—American identity [should not be subject-
ed to an ideological litmus test. There cannot be
an “essential” African American thought any more
than there can be an ‘essential thought of
American women or an essential thought of the
working class. It is a mistake to assume that if a
person‘ doesn’t embrace a certain line or dogma,
he or she is not ‘‘black.’’

It is also necessary to fight against the tempta-
tion to try to boost one’s self—esteem at the

I expense of others. Being pro—black should not
require that a person be anti—white, nor should it -

require being anti—semitic and homophobic. Self-
affrrmation cannot be built upon the negation of
others, it can only be built through developing
one’s own skills and expanding one’s knowledge
so that a person is able to make a meaningful
contribution to their community and to the ongo-
ing human project.

When people who aspire to leadership in the
African-American community resort to anti—semi—
tism and homophobia to advance their agenda,

ested in black pride and unity.

It must be pointed out that no
single organization can speak for all of the num-
bers of a given population within the student
body. This makes a mockery of the intelligence of
each of its members. The Campus Wornen’s
Organization, cannot claim to speak for all cam-
pus women; Campus Crusade for Christ cannot
claim to speak for all Christians; the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance cannot claim to speak
for all gays; and the Black Action Society cannot
claim to speak for all African Americans.

Each organization represents a view within a
community. It is important to keep in mind that
the what's expressed by an organization reflecst
the opinions of that organization, not necessarily
the population it claims to represent.

Hopefully, the Pitt Campus will be able to cele-
brate its diversity and not be destroyed by it. Also,
hopefully the pursuit of black pride and black
unity will not get bogged down in intellectual
dogmatism, unproductive witch-hunts and self-
imposed isolation.

Two weeks.

Fourteen days.

Half a month.

\‘(=’hate\'er you want to call it, that is

-how long the Pitt football team has

between the Ohio State debacle and its
next contest against Louisville.
And boy is it happy. 1 _
"I think we needed it," senior safety
Doug \‘C'haley said of Pitt’s timely open

date. “'lTimel allows us to take a step

back and take a‘ deep breath, the season
has gone so fast for us."
' How true.

In a blink of an eye, the Panthers

‘were on top against Southern

Mississippi.

Blink again and the Virginia Tech and
Ohio State beatings sent Pitt to 21 1-2
record with a quarter of the season
gone.

Now with the week off, Pitt has the
time to stare at its most recent problems
and try to correct them through prac-
tice. ‘

“We have to see our mistakes from
the previous games and learn from
them," \\'/haley said. “We have to

regroup from the past.”
The most recent past has not been
kind to the Panthers.

Beingoutscored 126 to 49 in its last‘

two games, something needs to be cor-
rected. ‘
“Fundamentally, we have to be

sound," Whaley said. “That was our

problem the last two games.”
Two games offensive tackle Reuben
Brown does not want to remember.
“This is how I look at it,” Brown said.

’ “We had two bad games and one good

one. We have to get back to the basics
and get back to the one good game we
had.” , I

To get back to that form, tailback
Curtis Martin thinks execution is the
key.

“A week to concentrate on execut-
ing,” Martin said. “A week to get our
minds together and focus on what we
have to do. »

‘‘The~coaches feel we have to capital-

ize on all the breaks we can get," Martin‘

said. “We can’t make the minor mis-
takes, those little things make a big dif-
ference.”

They sure do. But considering the last
two games, the littlethings got a little

The Panama Deception
Directed by Barbara Trent
Written by David Kasper

— Organized , government
deception? In the same year that
brings the Oscar winner The
Panama Deception to Pitts-

"burgh, “6O Minutes” jumped on‘
the story of El Mozote, the vil-
lage in El Salvador where some
700 civilians were massacred by
U.S.—backed Contras in 1981.

The Reagan administration,
then trying to push Contra .aid
through congress and fearing
the-negative press, engaged in
smear campaigns against
reporters Ray Bonner and Alma
Guillermoprieto (one represent-
ing the hallowed The
Washington Post and the other
that bastion of truth The New
Yorle times) who broke the stoiy
on the massacre itself, accord-
ing to the CBS news show.

Worse yet, mainstream media
sources Time and The Wall

,‘St7'eetl_/omnal acted as accom-
plices in the near slander of
these two reporters,-as both “6O

. Minutes”- and The Village Voice
document well. 0

But Doug Ireland of The
Voice, in a follow-up to the “6O
Minutes” piece, asks a critical
question,” Why then did Bonner
and the others have to wait
more than a decade to have
television cleanse their reputa-
tions? And why did this chal-
lenge to the credibility of the
Reagan and Bush administra-
tions have to wait until the mis-
creants had left office?” A

In the wake of this story
(Iranscam) and others, The
Panama Deception is but
another example of a belated
exposure of America’s dubious
dealings in Central and South
America, Banned by the Public
Broadcasting Station for its bla-
tantly one—s-ided boinbast
against Bush and thelvarious
governmental menageries he
travelled through, the film

,makes strong accusations of
government deception and its
illegal, subversive results. ’

Deception takes the decidedly
effective visual tactic of juxta-
posing footage of the massive
collateral dainage during the
actual invasion and the mili-
tary’s talking heads (Gulf War
star and Pentagon spokesman

A Pete \Y/illiams looks particularly

silly.) going on and on about
just how careful we were to
minimize any civilian casualties.

But there can be no doubt
that Deception has but one man
in mind as the culprit in the
cover up of atrocities and ille-

galities in Panama, George-

Bush.

As Central Intelligence
Agency director under Ford,
Bush was responsible for culti-
vating a special relationship
with General Noriega, one that

, involved the U.S. sending mil-

lions of taxpayer dollars into his
bank account in exchange for
information. ‘ \

CIA payrolls under garter, Bush,

up the ﬁles and see what We find.

Artist: Tha Alkaholiks

Album: 21 6; Over .
Producer(s): artist, E—Swift, Loot Pack and King
Tee

label: Loud/ RCA

Rating: @@@@@

If you’ve heard King Tee’s most recent album,
' T ha T riﬂin’ Album (which was dope as hell),

you have to know about this group. The song
“Got it Bad Y’all” the was debut for the ‘L-I’/es
(Alkaholiks, that is). But that was in ‘92.

Now it’s ‘93 and the group has its own ﬂavor.
On its debut album, the “‘Liks” (J-R0, Tash and

E-Swift) shows off like a poor person who hit the
lotto. This album is the true essence of hip—hop;
phat—ass beats and rugged rhymes complete with
clever metaphors and scratching. It’s not trendy at
all. It’s what rap started out as and is coming back
to. It’s very basic and funky as hell.

In addition to their basic, straightforward style
of rhyn1e,]-R0 drops the “alky-style of rhyme” on
us in “Only When I’m Drunk." That means he
burps and hiccups off of a brew while he’s
ﬂowin’. Then he passes the mic because he’s too
drunk to flow. Tash grabs it and drops funky—ass
lines like: « .

“It goes onefor the Chronic two for the amne-
sia/z't’s the pimp slczppin’ niggy with drinks in the
freezer. Bust the one eyed two eyed ‘hlitzed’ tithe
of rapper/that’ll get that ozifcha seat quicker than
61 carjacleer. ”

E—Swift (the deejay and producer of the group)
even gets wrek on this joint and a couple of oth-
ers throughout the album. This song consists of a
very basic loop (If you have EPMD’s first album,
check “It’s My Thing”) and sparsely placed piano
licks and horn riffs. '

“Last Call” (b-side of first single) has a heavy
drumtrack with a “Fat Albert” type of bassline and
a psychotic—piano strike, coupled with hard-
edged lyrics that make this cut extremely
knockin’. “Mary Jane” is a very clever song about
ism (weed), even though at times it’s so clever
that the band has you believing it’s an actual girl
at times. “Soda Pop” gives the ‘Liks a chance to
breathe while their boys, a new group called

Unrest
Perfect Tee!/3
4AD/TeenBeat

Next to M&Ms and squid, there are
few things Unrest leader Mark Robinson
likes more than writing gooey, gushy
songs about love. The D.C. band’s latest
effort Perfect Teet/9, debuting on
London’s 4AD label, is no exception.

A celebration of adolescent hormonal
bliss, all—night make out parties and
“seven minutes in heaven,” Perfect Teet/9
abides by the same fonnula Unrest’s last
release on its own TeenBeat label,
Imperial f.f.r.r., perfected In fact, very lit-
tle new ground is broken. One of the
tracks, “So Sick,” is so lyrically similar to
“Loyola” off the last album that when

, Robinson sings, “Yes, I would die for

you,” it’s easy to slip into verbal déja vu.

Opening with the ultra—slow, visceral, _

moody “Angel, I’ll Walk you Home,” the
band plummets full force into the hyper-
frenetic guitar of “Cath Carroll.” Almost
all of the material is about love and sex
and growing up. On “Light Command,”
Bridget Cross takes the lead and sings
“Back when I was 20 ...,” voicing two
years Worth of hindsight in breaking
from an obsessive relationship. It’s as if
those two years make a world of differ-
ence in personal growth.

One of the longest tracks, “Soon it is
Going to Rain,” is a slow, repetitive love
song. At times the lyrics are downright
pretty like, “From the day I found you/
love was so insane/ shovels in my hand

fron1/ digging for your pain.” But almost
every sugary, affectionate line is met
with a saccharine quip of some sort to
balance it out into cynical romanticism
for the "905 ‘indie youth. Robinson packs
more schmaltzy, sexual imagery into this
song than a Madonna video: “Ice cream
spilling down/ onto your chest” and “I’ll
hold your pants tight/ hands follow/
More to Come lcomel.” Subtle.

One of the strongest guitar cuts has to
be “Make Out Club,” an ode to every-
one’s first one, and “Six Layer Cake,” a
tune that has Robinson shouting out
numbers like some dadaist chemistry
equation, comes in a close second.

For the final cut, Bridget takes the lead
again in “Stylized Ampersand.” Her pret-
ty, fragile—sounding voice certainly con-

veys loneliness, but the lyrics try too
hard at times and end up feeling like one
of those overly-hip GAP commercials
that use poetry in a late—night supper
club to sell jeans.

Speaking of hip, Unrest seems to
ignore the trend set forth by most of its
hip indie counterparts. Instead of capital-
izing on its ‘70s roots and shunning an
early-"80s influence, the group asked
Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran to pro-

duce Perfect Yeet/9, and in a recent inter-

view, Bridget admitted that the first
album she ever bought was Rio.
Reinforcing this wave of retronostalgia,
the band snags a Robert Mapplethorpe
photo of early—’80s Factory Records artist
Cath Carroll for the cover.

STHE AGE OF
1NNocENcE 

The Age of Innocence _
Directed by Martin Scorsese

‘ Starring Daniel Day Lewis,

Michelle Pfeiffer and Wynona
Ryder

Living in. a town like
Pittsburgh where mansions
symbolizing old wealth still line
Fifth Avenue, it’s not hard to
imagine what life was like over
a hundred years ago. The
Mellons schmoozing it up with
the Scaifes and the Benedums,
the Fricks and the Carnegies
always trying to outdo one
another. -

But unlike Pittsburgh, the
mansions that" lined Fifth

Avenue in New York City have

either met their demise via a
wrecking ball or been bought
out by the likes of Ralph

.I.auren, Cartier and Chanel.

 \

With overdevelopment and
overcrowding, it’s hard to get a
feel for the old New York. The
New York of Edith \Y/harton’s
novel The Age of Innocence.
And who better to recreate this
old New York than homeboy
and auteur of Italian-American
culture, filmmaker Martin

Scorsese.

Although this stunningly
beautiful film has absolutely
nothing to do with the mob,
and not one scene was shot in
Little Italy or Soho, it deals with
a closed society where gaining
admittance is hard and respect
is even harder.

Set in the 1870s, Newland
Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), an
attorney and offspring from one
of the wealthiest clans in
Manhattan, is society’s best
catch and well—bred, wanly
beautiful,/naive socialite May
Welland’(Wynona Ryder) has
him. The couple announce their
betrothal at the annual Opera
Ball to coincide with the arrival
of May’s eccentric older cousin
from Europe, the Countess Ellen
Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer).

The countess’s bold flirtations

and straightforwardness seems

fresh and appealing to Archer in
comparison to his radiant, but
seemingly clueless, wife.
However, most of New York
societyfrowns on the countess
for her untraditional upbringing
and her outspokeness. But most

Cover Up

Continued from page S-3
as vice president under Reagan,
personally put him back on the
government gravy train, some-
thing the ﬁlm clairns as an indis-
putable fact.

All this despite Noriega’s
known involvement in drug
traficking. Bush, as vice presi-

dent, was ironically in charge of _

the Reagan administrations anti-
drug programs at the same time
that he re-enrolled the general.
It should be obvious at this
point that Bush’s righteous

rhetoric around the time of the

actualinvasion is at extreme
odds with his previous actions
concerning that by now, infa-
mous international criminal and
evil, “-narco—terrorist” Manuel
Noriega. Deception plays this to
the hilt, matching presidential
soundbites with rather incrimi-
nating snippets from the days
when Noriega was somehow
fair-complected in U.S. eyes.

No less incriminating are

comments by both a Rear ;

Admiral and a former CIA ana-
lyst that the Panama invasion
was more than partially spurred
by Bush’s political need to shed
his “wimp” image.

Deception rarely holds back
for fear of pointing a ﬁnger and
often uses journalists, former
officials and a vast array of
experts to do that bidding in the
filmmakers stead.

More importantly, the film
takes a critical look at the main-
stream (television) medias sore-
ly lacking coverage of the inva-
sion and its aftermath. This look
is perhaps the film’s most damn-
ing, and the parade of America’s
evening news ‘talking heads as
they do little more than capsu-
late the official line (or lie if you
like) for their captive audiences
has an ominous effect. As
Deception uses the montages of
news coverage from all the
major television sources
(including CNN and MacNiel/
Lehrer), the Rathers, Koppels
and Brokaws go a long way in
indicting themselves.

Few documentaries go as far
as Deception in challenging
government cover—ups. To call
the film manipulative is a little
ridiculous because thellogic
behind that criticism assumes
that there is some standard of
objectivity. _

That in mind, Deception can

be seeas a valuable, informa-

tive and compelling criticism of
what amounts to a tangled web
of dubious dealings, and yes,
even conspiracy among U.S.
policy mongers in general and
Bush in particular. The result.
evident in the untold destruc-
tion and violence, lived mostly
upon Panarna’s civilian popula-
tion. V

You’d almost think PBS felt
that its viewers would be too
stupid to look at this documen-
tary with their own critical eye
and thus the ban. Until, that is,
you see that the “fairness”

decree was an act of
Congressional wisdom. So

much for the credibility of that.

of all they frown on her for marrying the
wrong man abroad. Seeking a divorce at
this time in history is unheard of, and
everyone is so caught up in tradition and
rituals that any underlying feelings she
has get stepped on almost instantaneous-
1y. I - I
Wharton’s novel is ultra-sensitive to all
the social mores of New York’s elitist
society. -In fact, she’s so in tunewith her
material that Scorsese’s adaptation is

‘almost biblically and methodically word

for word. From the opulent gowns, interi-
or decorum and attention to period
flower arrangements to the elaborate
table settings and food preparation,

everything about The Age of Innocence ,

transports you into the Victorian era with
all of its beautiful decadence and obscene
frivolity. But for all its sweeping beauty
and suffering heros and heroines, some-
times it’s hard to feel sorry for people
who’s main daily concern is deciding
what’s fashionable.

In the opening at the Opera Ball,
through narration Joanne Woodward
describes the series of drawing rooms
one moves through to get to the grand
ballroom of a posh New York mansion.

The jostling camera follows Archer
through the rooms dizzying the audience
with social claustrophobia. By the time
Archer makes his way to the ballroom,
the now—swirling camera is completely
caught up in the Waltzing couples on the
dance ﬂoor making us as whoosey as a
Victorian lady in a corset three sizes too
small.

All of these oh-so-perfect exterior
details play surface to a whole subtext of
human emotions. Like novelist Kate
Chopin, Wharton addresses the woman’s
place in society. Should a woman have
weightier concerns than what dress she
should wear to a luncheon? According to
the overwhelming majority of men in the
film, no, women shouldn’t fill their pretty
heads with any attempt at truly intelligent
conversation. Archer is the exception,
and he pays for it by giving up the one
thing that is most dear to him.

The Age of In nocence is about requited
love disguised under the pretext of unre-
quited love. And in this case, the only
solution seems to be to run away. Human
motivationsjbeing what they are, some-
times_the easiest thing in the _world to do
is to avoid the very thing that you want to
see the most. And in following the long-

standing tradition of the tragic protago-
nist, Archer and Countess Olenska do this
to each other on countless occasions
making their own internal suffering all the
more unbearable.

Finally, The Age of Innocence addresses
a familiar Scorsese theme — the
American identity. Throughout the film
we see Americans vainly struggling to act,
dress and live according to European tra-'
dition. Pfeiffer’s character blatantly corn-
ments on this, joking that Christopher
Columbus shouldn’t have gone. to all the
trouble of discovering America if all we’re
going to do is copy European tradition.
Similarly, as in mob flicks, it’s not so
much copying all of Europe to suit the
memories of midtown Manhattan but
recreating Sicilia or Palermo as the dons
of Mulberry Street remember it.

So in reality Scorsese isn’t dealing with
any really new themes, it’s the presenta-
tion that’s different. Instead of smearing
the screen with blood and various inter-
nal organs, he smears it with smoked
salmon and garnet-colored silk. It’s a
kinder, gentler Scorsese than of recent
years and a much appreciated one.

Field Trip, shows its skills on
the mic (and these kids can def-

initely hold their own!).

The whole album is the sh't,
but the song that got me open
the most has to be “Make
Room” (the first single). Once
you listen to this song, you can’t
help but rewind it and play it
again. It has an evil horn riff that
grabs the hell out of your atten-
tion while the drumtrack
pounds heavily. Thef’Liks freak
this one like it was the group’s
last song. _I—ro “knocks ‘em out
the park while other rappers are
hittin’ bunts,” and Tash is
“screamin’ ‘ on MCs like
Onyx/'he’s hooked on gin and
tonic like your mama’s hooked
on phonics.” With cameos by
King Tee, Threat, Loot Pack
and Field Trip, it’s a sure
investment. It’s the bomb!!

You’re probably thinking this
is too good to be true, and
you’re right. -I do have a prob-
len1 with this album. My beef is

 the sh*t’s not long enough!!
There’s only 10 cuts on the
album, but all 10 are bomb!! If
the group would have pulled a
Russell Siirunons move (buying
the rights to the song that fea-
tured its artist on someone
else’s album) and put “Got It
Bad Y’all” and “Bust Dat Ass” on
here, this would be the album
to beat. But nothing takes away
from the strength of this album.
They‘re right, “You can’t tell ‘em

and had ‘em soaring high and
fast like a Concord jet. But once
you get the album and listen to
it, the group starts to land like
the Greatest American Hero.

On this its debut LP, the
“trendmen” fail to impress. “Off
and On” had that commercial
appeal with that catchy hook
and phat track to get it over.
The style of rhyme was weaker
than sugar water, and the lyrics
were muddier than quicksand
but the beat was knockin’. The
second single, “Valley of the
Skinz,” basically sets the theme
of the album. On “Valley  it
starts out with a live ass piano
and space organ set up. The
band starts chanting its chorus
and messes. up the whole pro-
gram with a lazy drum track. On
the remix, it makes up for that
by hooking up a drum track
with some swing.

The basic theme of this album
is skins, skins and more skins.
No skills but skins. “Old Habits”

refer to the groups exs and"

other women the members
have done in the past. “Crotch

, Ripper/Mad Speaker” speaks of

how it pulled off these amazing

- feats. In a nut shell, this album

is very redundant and goes
nowhere fast. It did have a few

bright spots. The jazz break the
group used for “Who Got My
Back” was hella phat. It gives a
smoky jazz club feel to it. The
“Valley...” remix has a rugged

drumtrack and heavy bassline. V

(Although, I find it stupid to put
the same song twice on an
album.) “Off and On” has a
slammin’ track with a “ragtime”
like trumpet. “Top Ten

V Interlude” has a smooth, milky

jazz groove that serves as the
basis of this song.

Even though the production
had it moments, the lyrics
didn’t. When the band was
“freestylin’,” it didn’t say any-
thing spectacular; hell, it didn’t

, say anything average. That “off

and on” style of rhyming was
Very annoying, ‘boring and
wack. The only reason that they
didn’t get @ headphone is
because I found myself bobbing
to a couple of tracks before the
group started rhyming. If the
album was instrumental, it
could have probably received
@@@ headphones.

One thing the members said
to one of my colleagues from
the video show, that I also work
on, definitely refers backto
themselves. , When asked what
an aspiring artist should do to

get in the business, they replied,
“Work hard and keep your day
jobs because some of y'all are
wack and don’t know it.” I sug-
gest that they go and get their
Mcjobs back!

Volleyball finally returns home, hosts USAir Classic

Panthers host

Syracuse, Kansas, .

Virginia Tech
at Fitzgerald
Friday, Saturday

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

Today is a first for the Pitt
volleyball team for the 1995
season —— it is Thursday, and
they are not going anywhere.

After three weeks of road
trips, the Panthers will be at
home this weekend hosting
Syracuse, Kansas and Virginia
Tech in the USAir Classic at
Fitzgerald Field House.‘

“We're all excited to be play-
ing at home,” setter Annemarie
l\/Iernagh said.

There are other reasons for

the anticipation of this week-
end. -
“I think they are excited to
prove to themselves that _we’re
capable. of playing three _great
matches and not have a let-
down,” assistant coach Brian
Begor said. “That’s the goal 
to be able to sustain a high
level of intensity.”

Last weekend, a letdown cost
the Panthers a loss to
Wisconsin at the Hofstra
Spalding Classic.

“I’d be very surprised, if
mentally, we're notprepared to

play this weekend, because I '

think we felt as a group, we

_ were not mentally prepared to,

play last weekend at Hofstra,”
Begor said.
Pitt opens its conference

’ schedule as well as its home
schedule with Syracuse at

7:3_Op.m. tomorrow. The
Orangewomen have been top
contenders in the Big East in
recent years but lost four
starters to graduation. One of
the few returning starters, six-
foot—three—inch middle blocker
Angie Casazza, has been the
top attacker with 104 kills, and
rookie outside hitter Danielle
Bethre leads with 108 digs.

So far, Syracuse has stumbled
to a 5-7 mark, losing" its last
four matches entering this
w_eekend.

“Coming into the tournament,
thcy’ve struggled,” Begor said.
“I’m sure they see this tourna-
ment as an opportunity to beat

_peop1e. Teams like thatiare

dangerous.”

More dangerous for the
Panthers will be Saturday
morning’s opposition, Kansas.

“They have a lot of returning
players and they are pretty ath-
letic,” Begor said. “That’s what
concerns me most about
Kansas. They’re a lot like
Wisconsin. I think they are 
athletic. They are going to play
good defense”,

Kansas is the kind of match
Begor says is important for the
team. It is not a great team, but
not one Pitt can easily over-
whelm.

“The only matches where

you can really learn about

yourselves are the ones that
you really have to battle for
points.

"You are in a position to win
them and in a position to lose
them,” Begor said. “[The play-
ers are] still learning, trying to
find their level of mental tough-
ness.

."Trying to get over the edge.
That’s the way you get over the
edge, by beating equal oppo-
nents.”

The jayhawks are 6-5 this
season. Senior- middle blocker
Cindee Kanable has been the
top attacker with three kills per
game. Sophomore outside hit-
ter Tracy Walt and one of the
team’s two setters, Leslie
Steinert, anchor the Kansas
defense with 135 and 144 digs,
respectively.

At last weekend’s Big
Eight/South East Conference
Tournament, it knocked off a
solid Louisiana State University
team and lost to 18th-ranked
Georgia. The loss broke a five-
match winning streak for the

‘ Jayhawks.

Saturday night Pitt will trade
shots with another of Georgia’s

for the regular season Metro
Conference championship. The

Cardinals beat the Hokies in

the finals of the conference
tournament. '

The Hokies’ top player is

outside hitter Heather
Berglund, an all—conference
pick the last two years.

Berglund is Virginia Tech’s top
defensive player and has‘ 177
digs this season.

“I consider her the best pri-_
mary receiver in the Metro
Conference,” Hokie head coach
Stephanie Hawbecker said.-
“Her leadership, consistency
and ball control will be a key
for us this year.”

Despite returning four
starters, the Hokie attack is still
adjusting to a change at setter.
Kelly Chambliss graduated and
rookie Laura Hanner has
stepped in, with sophomore
Hilary Love seeing time in

reserve.

All three opponents are part
of Pitt’s respite from the road.
The Panthers go right back out
of town next weekend as they
visit Big East rivals Seton Hall,

Providence and the University .

of Connecticut.

IUP upends women ’s tennis team at Cost Center

By Dan Lauso
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s tennis team
lost a thrilling match against
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania yesterday after-
noon at the Cost Center.

Six singles matches didn’t
decide anything with each team
winning three matches.

The Panthers’ attack was led
by sophomore Marla Zielinski.

Zielinski frustrated her oppo-
nent throughout the match with
viscous forehands and aggres-
sive play at the net. She won
the match in two sets by the
score 6-4, 6-2.

Tammy Keister fought
through the pain of a sore
shoulder to record her first vic-

tory of the season. Keister hus-
. tled her way past the hard hit-

ting Jenny Galvan of IUP to
win 6-2, 7-5.

The match of the day
involved Pitt’s Kristen Siegel.
Siege] ran a marathon on her
way to a three-set victory over
her IUP counterpart, eventually

_ winning 6-5, 4-6, 6-1.

The other Panthers fell in
their attempts to secure the
team’s third victory of the sea-
son.

Pitt’s No. 1 seed Alison Baker
fought hard but lost her match
in straight sets. Baker’s game

matches each, the deciding
doubles matches began.

The doubles matches started
out promising for the Panthers
with the top-seeded team of
Zielinski and Baker breezing
through their opponents. The
team of Zielinski and Baker
easily won in two sets by the
score 6-3, 6-2.

The Panthers bid for victory
fell short, however, in the ﬁnal
two doubles matches of the
afternoon.

Both teams played some
intense and spirited tennis but
just couldn’t get over the top to
secure a victory.

Kristen Siege], tired from
playing a three-set match, and
teammate Hillary Gordon lost
in straight sets 6-2,’ 6-2.

Junior Tammy Keister, still
nursinga sore shoulder, and
her partner Becky Elliot lost the
final and deciding match of the
afternoon losing 6-2, 6-3.

Coach Dieffenbach was not
discouraged by his young
teams’ defeat. _

“Even though we lost, it was
still a positive experience for
us,” Dieffenbach said. “A good
win followed by playing a
strong team [Duquesne]
Tuesday makes us better.

“IUP only played better dou-
bles than us,” Dieffenbach said.

The loss dropped Pitt’s sea-
son record to two wins and
three losses. .

weekend at Princeton.

Panthers

Continued from page 6
smaller, courtesy of the lop-
sided scores.

Injuries, however, never get
smaller, they just linger. But the
week off definitely eases the
bumps and bruises.

“We needed time for our
injuries,” Brown said. “And for
the guys who are playing, they
just need the rest.” '

“It’s really a healing process
for those taking the abuse on
the field,” Martin added.

With the two weeks, Pitt can
hope for the recuperation of
linebackers Tom Tumulty
(elbow) and Gerald Simpson
(knee), and the long-awaited,
full-strength return of running
back Tim Colicchio.

But enough of the hard
work, gutsy practices and the
healing power of time,‘what
does a free weekend mean to
some of the players?

“Relaxing, that is what I will
be doing on Saturday,” Whaley
said. “I’ll watch some college
games that I don’t normally get
to watch on Saturdays.”

How about do—it—all Martin,
and a week off from the

  
  
  
  
   
 
  

 
  
  

numerous hits the tailback
takes each Saturday?

“The one day off [does mira-
cles for your body,” Martin
said. “After that one day, my
body feels like it is the begin-
ning of the season.

“I’ll also watch a few teams
that we play later in the season,
the Notre Dames and Miamis,”
Martin added.

And what about thebig
offensive lineman Brown.

“We’re going to go fishing,”
Brown said about a teammate
outdoor excursion. “Hopefully
we can catch some catﬁsh.

“Last week Hayes [Clark] and
I went out and I caught a four-
and-a-half pound catfish,”
Brown said. “[Matt] Bloom and
I now have a bet to see who
can catch the most fish this
weekend.” ’

Good luck guys.

Soccer

Continued from page 6
1y) 73:34 of the game. That’s
when Pitt’s Eric Duffy, who
had been rejected by Rocket
goalies on breakaway
attempts earlier, took the
long walk from the front
porch of emptiness to the
front seat of redemption,
knocking in a corner kick —
the culmination of a myriad
of unanswered prayers — to
put Pitt up. '

Finally.

“I don’t’ know how it hap-
pened,” Duffy said. “The ball
hit oﬂ° one of their guys and I
think one of our guys put it
back in play. It was more of
a pass to Prex than a shot.”

Duffy’s goal — his first of
two last night — came after
numerous breakaway

attempts by the Panthers
came up hollow.

“It was a real cheesy goal
 the guy got lucky to hit it
in the way that he did,”
Slippery Rock goalie
Newcomer said. “It was really
disheartening  you could
tell we kinda snapped. We
were really pushing up trying
to get one [goal], and it really
seemed we were going to
win because I kept coming
up [with a save]. It just didn’t
happen tonight.”

Duffy’s two goals busted
the night open, taking Pitt to

the road of victory for the

first time this season. He
added his second of the
game -— third of the year —
at 85:50, followed by
Panthers’ forward Eric Prex’s

second goal of the year at
88:00 to seal the Panthers’
first win of the season.

But despite the late scoring
outburst, Luxbacher was out-
wardlyfrustrated with the
Panther forwards’ lack of
production — tonight and
throughout the season.

“Bottom line is they had
chances, they were given
golden opportunities, and
they didn’t do it,” Luxbacher
said.

“These guys have got to do
it. Everybody wants to play.
up front but we don’t have a
lot of guys who are doing the
job, so we’re gong to be
looking at other people. We
need people who can put the
ball in the goal when it’s
there.”
