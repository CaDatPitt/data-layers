Brad Swink is a full-time Pitt student, a
full-time waiter, a writer, biker, triathlete,
husband, and a public relations intern.

But Swink is also a baseball fan who

could not stand the Pittsburgh Pirates’
advertising campaign last year. It irritated
himsomuchthathewrotealettertoPirates
owner Kevin McClatchy and proposed the
slogan “Pittsburgh Pirates: Everything
that’s right about baseb ” to replace “Let’s
go to wo ”

gan,” said Swink. “It had nothing to do with

baseball. These guys are getting paid mil-
lions of dollars to live out their boyhood

“I thought so little of [last year’s] slo-.

dreams.”

Swink never really expected the
Pirates to respond to his proposal, but
McClatchy surprised him by offering to use
a portion of his letter as the basis of their
new advertising campaign. The Bucs liked
his closing line, in which he said the Pirates
are “what baseball is all about.”

At this time last year, Swink did not
knowifhecouldmakealivingasawriter.
But now his slogan is splashed all over
Pirates territory and he’s mentioned in the
media, not to mention that he’s ready to pay
his bills with his pen.

“You really can’t put a dollar ﬁgure on
the exposure I’ve been getting,” said
Swink.

KDKA News have proﬁled Swink, and the
Pirates acknowledged him in their monthly
newsletter. Swink said he placed the slogan
ﬁrst in his writing portfolio for job inter-
views.

And in what was especially valuable to
this life-long baseball fan, Swink got to
throw out the ﬁrst pitch at last wednesday’s
Pirates-Braves’ game.

VV1th one more item on this busy stu-
dent’s list of things to do, Swink could be

and relaxed, despite the attention andextra

Swink said matter—of-factly. “It was just

Maintenance
worker

  found dead

Hal Turner

News Editor

A Pitt maintenance worker was
found dead of apparent natural causes
in the third ﬂoor men’s bathroom of
Mervis Hall Thursday evening.

While checking the bathroom
around 11:30 p.m., a security guard
found the man dead on the ﬂoor.

Emergency crews arrived shortly

afterward, and the man -was declared-

D.O.A.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service did not
know the employee’s name, and the Pitt
police refused to disclose it, claiming
that his name was possibly “sensitive
information.”

According to Service, a Pittsburgh
city detective said the 45-year-old man
died of natural causes.

After police examined the scene,
the body was removed at 1:35 a.m. on
Friday and transported to the county
coroner’s office.

The coroner could not be reached
for comment.

_ “If God himself put stipulations on
the system, and Jerry Klayman wanted to
come back and embezzle, he could,” said
SGB member Kelly Meyers.

She added, though, that the current
system makes such actions more conspic-
uous to other allocations committee or
SGB members over the summer. This
summer, several people must approve
decisions instead of just the allocations
chair and the board president.

Board President Alyson Wallach
noted that summer corruption could only
occur if every board and committee
member at Pitt was “in on it.” She said
this scenario is highly improbable.

Milani said because he made the
changes and the current board wasn’t
familiar with the allocations system when
it took over in January, the members’
ideas were “less valid.”

Christopher Boback, the Allocations
Committee chair, reasserted Milani’s sen-
timent, saying that SGB candidates often
promise changes to the committee before
knowing what goes into it. For someone
to thoroughly understand the system well
enough to make positive changes, he
said, they would have to sit on the com-
mittee for a year, which none of the cur-
rent board members has done.

But Milani and Boback said the
board now has the experience to make
contributions, as far as alterations to the
system go.

“After the appeals they just ha ,”
said Milani, referring to the lengthy stu-
dent organization funding appeals
process the board was part of last month,
“they now have the opportunity to make
suggestions on what they’d want to
change.”

Board member Damon Hudac had a

THE PITT NEWS 3 A

suggestion, although he made it during
his campaign: He proposed the
Allocations Committee be given the
power to overrule the SGB’s decisions.
The board currently decides whether allo-
cations’ recommendations to them are
accepted or denied.

Now that Hudac is a SGB member
and understands how the entire system
runs, including Milani’s changes, his
original goal isn’t important, he said.

“If you have good board members,
it’s really urmecessary,” said Hudac. “I
don’t think it’s as necessary as I did
[when campaigning].”

Hudac went on to say that the current
board has a concern for students’ needs,
so now he doesn’t feel as strongly about
his campaign proposal.

Wallach also changed her mind about
an allocations suggestion since she’s been
on the board for a few months.

While running, she suggested the
Allocations Committee allow the SGB
president and business manager to sit in
on its meetings. Now, she doesn’t see the
point.

“There’s no reason for that,” said
Wallach. “The communication has been
great [between the groups] so it’s not nec-
essary.”

Boback agrees that communication
between the board and committee is
good, especially compared to previous
years. » .

“If the board overturns one of our
recommendations,” he said, “they also
send back the rationale and reasoning.”

“I sat on the committee a year ago
and we never got any feedback,” Boback
said. “Relations were not so ‘smooth,
sometimes rocky.”

Boback said these improved relations
are professional, as well as personal, and
that has made a world of difference. A

Tornado victims remembered

Across the Nation

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — On the day
Christians celebrate the resurrection of
Jesus Christ, funeral services continued
in Alabama for victims of last week’s
tornado.

One followed the Easter Sunday
service at Rock Creek Church of God,
which lost six members, including a
mother and two sons killed in the col-
lapse of a nearby house.

Thirty—three people were killed and
more than 160 others were injured
when tornadoes marauded across three
counties around Birmingham
Wednesday night. Seven more people
were killed by other tornadoes in the
south.

At the Open Door Baptist Church,
worshippers had a message of rebirth,
love and healing. Pastor Rick Cooper
told the congregation, “There’s a time
to cry. But let me tell you: Life is
important.”

WASHINGTON — A U.S. govem—
ment report suggests crime in schools is
on the rise. _

The study says nearly twice as
many teenagers reported gangs in their
schools in‘1995 as they did in 1989.
Meanwhile, the number of students vic-
timized by violent crime increased
nearly 25 percent.

President Clinton calls the findings
“unacceptable.” He’s urging Congress
to ﬁght the trend by approving anti-
gang and youth violence initiatives he
offered a year ago.

Based on surveys of students aged
12 to 19, street gangs were spotted in
schools by 28.4 percent of those ques-
tioned in 1995 compared to 15.3 per-

‘cent in 1989. One of the study’s authors

says that could reﬂect an increased
awareness of what a gang is.

Violent crime at school was report-
ed by 4.2 percent of students in 1995.
That’s up from 3.4 percent six years
ago.

another part of my day, my week, my
month.” _ A
Swink’s days, weeks and months
encompass -a whirlwind of responsibilities.
-He returned to school full-time last
May after a ﬁve-year hiatus. In June 1997,
in the midst of his retum to college, he got
married Since then, he’s balanced three

' full—time -obligations: ﬁnishing his under-

graduate writing degree at Pitt, working
full—time at the Carlton Restaurant down-
town and “ﬂying to be a good husband.”
Plus, Swink interned with Mellon Bank’s
Public Relations Department for the entire
1997-98 school year and spent this semes-
ter reporting for The Pitt News.

Somehow, he gets everything done.

“I’m the most organized person you

know,” he said “I’m a planner. I write down
everything.” V

Some of Swink’s intensity and
endurance stems from athletic training. His
athletic career began as a kid playing base-
ball. As an adult, he participated in
triathlons from 1987 until 1990. He discov-
ered his love of bicycle racing by training
with a friend. I

“I was a much better endurance athlete
than baseball player,” he said. “It was all
about training hard and eating right.”

For ﬁve years, Swink paid his bills as a
waiter, beginning at Houlihan’s and work-
ing his way up to the ﬁne dining at the
Carlton. And in his spare time, he trained for
bike races. _

Swink surprised himself by winning
his ﬁrst cycling competition, a 20- or 30-
mile race with 100 competitors.

“After winning the ﬁrst bike race I ever

   

entered, it wasn’t the illustrious career I
anticipated,” he said, smiling. “But it was a
good beginning.”

Swink last raced in 1996 and said he
hopes to start again soon. He’s anxious for

. the ﬁeedom from deadlines and exams after

graduation so he can devote more time to
riding, training and racing.

Despite Swink’s dedication and organi-
zation, his academic career started olf in a
rocky fashion. He attended Penn State
University for two years after high school,
earning 60 credits. Then he attended mortu-
ary school for a year and joined his father’s
business for a year and a half as a flmeral
director. Following that stint, Swink
enrolled at Pitt for three semesters before
dropping out again. i

“I never knew really what I wanted to

do,” Swink said.

His interest in writing began in 1985

when he started writing poetry. But he did-
n’t realize at the time where that could take
him.

“One day I woke up and realized I had
a talent. I knew I needed 30-some credits, so
I plotted the quickest schedule to graduate,”
he said. “[Graduating] is going to be a big
deal. I made it a big deal. It means a lot to
me,” he said.

Swink, who is generally laid—back
about everything, even his descriptions of

his busy schedule, gets excited when he 

talks about becoming a writer: That’s anoth-
er reason why he can’t wait to graduate.
“I’d like to pay my bills as a writer.
That is very, very important to me.” He said
humbly, “It’s tough to make a statement like
this, but I think I’m a good writer. Whether
it be as a corporate writer, a book writer, a
magazine writer, that’s what I want to do.”
Like most seniors, Swink said he
expectedto relax throughout this semester,
ﬁnally his last. But his Newspaper 11 course

requirements derailed those plans. As a "

News II writer, Swink devised a health and
ﬁtness beat for The Pitt News and wrote fea-
tures, proﬁles and news stories that were
published every week The course also
required him to write a 10-page, three-part
newspaper feature story, for which he

. researched and reported on smoking on

campus.
“What struck a chord for me,” Swink

said, “was when [my instructor] said you

can get everything done in the beginning of "

the semester.” - ,

Swink hit the pavement looking for
stories and wrote an average of two articles
per week until he met the requirements.

Describing his packed schedule, Swink
said, “Before work I was interviewing peo-
ple, between shifts at the Carlton I was writ-
ing. I remember making phone calls at
11:00 at night after wor ”

He said the course, although a chal-
lenge considering his other obligations,
taught him how to be a good interviewer
and how to improve his skill.

“In these last three months, I can’t even
tell you what a better writer I’ve become,”
Swink said emphatically.

Rather than taking a deep breath and
relaxing after completing his News 11
requirements, Swink started working on his
novel. For a while he’s wanted towrite a
novel about cycling based on his own expe-
rience of difficult rides or races. So far, he
has completed about three chapters and
hopes to send a manuscript to the Velo Press
in Boulder, Colo., when he completes 10
chapters.

Swink described the book as “deﬁnite-
ly a niche novel.” But, he said, it’s fun to
write.

Even with so many obligations to con-
tend with, Swink still ﬁnds time for com-
passion to others. While he talked for this
article, a young, pregnant woman
approached him asking for money. Before
she even reached Swink’s side, he had
jumped to his feet, and pulled a dollar from
his wallet.

Swink sat down, shaking his head
sadly, and said, “I hate to see things like
that”

Promises kept and
more to come, we hope

As the semester comes to a close, so does the ﬁrst
third of this term for members of this Student
Government Board. V

Perhaps out of fear of reliving a series of foul—ups by
last year's board, or perhaps just because they are, on the
whole, a very dedicated group of student leaders, this
board has surprised us all by keeping up with many of its
campaign promises and goals.

The members have also proven to be an honest
group, always willing to answer questions honestly and
frankly, even when they would rather not. It's refreshing
to see a group of "politicians" who are so forthcoming.
The credit for this should probably go to President
Alyson Wallach, who has allowed her board members to
speak their minds openly and ﬁeely, in stark contrast to
former President Justin Da]Molin, who seemed to keep
his troops quiet, so only the "oﬂicial" opinions were pre-
sented. '

It is for both of these reasons that we believe they
were sincere when they made their campaign promises
and that they will continue to chase the goals they have
yet to achieve. Some of these goals are quite worth mak-
ing the effort. ‘

For example, board member Jennifer Karch said she
wanted to "heighten campus safety and awareness."
Karch says she now plans to open the lines of commu-
nication with local police to provide us with more infor-
mation about near-carnpus crime. .

The Pitt police already provide this newspaper with
a "police blotter" which lists on—carnpus police reports.

In addition to furnishing a few laughs on occasion, the .

police blotter serves an important purpose: It can tell stu-
dents a great deal about what kinds of crime they should
watch for.

But a lot of criminal activity occurs just off campus,
outside the Pitt police jurisdiction. Such activity is han-
dled by city police, who do not ﬁle a list of their reports
for students to access.

Since most students who live off campus spend a
great deal of their time in these areas, knowledge of
crime there would enhance the likelihood that students
will be able to look out for their own safety.

Karch also said she would like to continue trying to
establish a student representative on the Board of
Trustees. While this goal may be a bit lofty and more dif-
ﬁcult to achieve, it would allow direct communication
between students and those who really run this school
and decide the direction for our chosen University, as
well as to what uses our tuition dollars go.

Do you want me to make you a saint?

Dave

Madden

I'm not 20 years old yet —
close, but not yet. I haven't willing-
ly gone to church in years and I
haven't prayed in even more. I'm
neither religious nor an atheist, I
just don't have anything to say
about religion except that it's not for
me. Period.

I am, however, an ordained
minister.

You can probably assume that I
didn't go through years of training
in dogma or what have you to get
this title, and you'd be right. I don't
quite remember exactly how I got
my certiﬁcation, except that I was
on the Web, it was late, and I found
myself on the page for I the
Universal Life Church, who (not
surprisingly) have based them-
selves somewhere in California, I
think. All it took was a short form to
ﬁll out — anything of moderate
length and I probably would have
surfed right past the page —— and
BOOM! — I printed out my little
certiﬁcate granting me all the rights
and privileges of a full—ﬂedged min-
ister.

"Rad," I thought and tacked it
up on my wall, where it received the
admiration of several visitors to my
room, along with a lot of questions:

"How'd you get that?"

"What does it mean?"

"What can you do now? Can

- you wed somebody?"

Not knowing any in—depth
answers to any of these questions, I
soon forgot all about my little min-
istry jaunt, until I got an obnoxious-
ly large e-mail message several
weeks later along with an obnox-
iously large sound ﬁle attachment.
In it were all my rights and duties as

a minister, along with the "story" of
the Universal Life Church.

The real story, which they did-
n't overtlytell me but my cynicism
eventually spelled out, was that
these wackos were lonely and want-
ed a bunch of people to join their
club, hence the rampant indoctrina-
tion of minsters they practice over
phone lines. They told me to use my
ministerial (you'll have to forgive
my weirded—out variations on the
word minister, it's not a word I'm all
too familiar with) powers to name
other ministers. They also let me
indoctrinate saints. Me, a guy who
can't name many real—life saints out-
side of the ones named after holi-
days, can indoctrinate saints. But
hey, they let me do it, so who am I
to get in the way of spreading the
Universal Life word?

Of course, this whole situation
is ludicrous, but at the same time I
think it makes a pretty poignant
statement about the seriousness of
religions today. Obviously you have
your old standbys (Catholicism,
Protestantism, Judaism and all the
others) who are serious about who
they are and who they want heading
their churches. But now we have
these odd sects and churches pop-
ping up all over the place just to get
recognition.

I think these guys in California
are Christian, but they seem to be
much more interested in numbers
and public awareness than in prac-
ticing some sort of faith. How seri-
ously can you take a church that lets
me be a minister, and enables this to
happen with a tired Internet connec-
tion at 2 a.m.? I've never met a sin-
gle member of this church, and yet
I'm a well—respected member.

Maybe this isn't as bad as I
think. Maybe the Universal Life

THE PITT NEWS

Church, is only doing one of its core
jobs as a religion by making people
feel as though they're an important
part of something larger. Is it really
that bad that I have the power to
marry two people? If anyone is
foolish enough to have me preside
over their wedding, then I'm sure
my complete lack of respectable
credentials isn't a big important fac-
tor for them. And who's to say my
credentials as minister aren't
respectable? Maybe there's a couple
out there who refuse to be married
by anyone outside of the Universal
Life Church.

I personally have no opinions at
all about religion, which may be a
big lie (I mean, how can I write a
colunm about religion without hav-
ing opinions about religion?), but
it's what I like to tell myself. So I
take this whole situation as humor-
ous. I believe that some of you out
there would be angered by this:
either by the fact that a heathen like
myself can now be called Rev.
Dave Madden, or that I would
speak so lackadaisically about a
subject you hold dear.

If either of these is the case,
then I hope you would be so angry
as to actually do something like tell
me or my fellow church members
how stupid you think we are, but
I'm already aware of how stupid we
are, so you can save your breath.
The Universal Life Church, though,
apparently still needs some real
enlightenment: http://www.ulc.org
is their URL, in case you're up to the
challenge.

Oh, and if anyone would like to
be a saint, just drop me a line. I'm

p1'CtlIy easy.

Dave Madden is damn proud of his
lack of hyperbole in this column.

ome rewrite history as they see fit, others as it suits them

John Lacny
Columnlst

When I heard that the National Airport
in Washington had been renanred in honor of
Ronald Reagan, my ﬁrst thoughts were natu-
rally of the 11,000—plus air-tralfic controllers
Reagan ﬁred in 1981 in a ﬂagrant display of
contempt for workers’ rights (not to mention
airline safety).

The enactment of the name change was
a stroke of genius on the part of the House
Republicans who pushed it through: Not
only did they ﬁnd a way to glorify their medi-
ocrity of a hero in the name of the whole
nation, but they did so by delivering a sym-
bolic slap in the face to working people.

At ﬁrst, this latest act of Gipper-canon-
ization struck me as particularly repugnant.
But then I remembered that Reagan and his
supporters have long had a ﬂair for the use of
symbolism in ﬂaunting their contempt for
basic democratic values.

After all, it was Reagan who, in his ir1fa-

‘ mous visit to Bitburg, Germany in May of

1985, saw ﬁt to lay a wreath in memory of
the Nazi S.S. ,

These ruminations on the subject of
moral blindness in public monuments
inspired me to embark on a search of the
local area for such curiosities. I remembered,
of course, that Schenley Park had already
been covered Last October, an anonymous
group of "vandals" had used red paint to
remind us that the so-called "discoverer" of
theAmericashadagreatdealofbloodonhis
hands. I knew, though, that there must be

other symbolic outrages to expose, perhaps

even closer to the main buildings of the Pit
campus. Maybe something all of us walked
by every day.

Deciding to go with my instincts, I took
a jalmt up Fifth Avenue to Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial. And there, like a juicy
apple ripe for the picking, I found one.

At . _Soldiers—.. and
Sailors Memorial, there
is a series of plaques
commemorating the
dead and wounded in
each war the United
States has been involved
in. And on the ﬁnal
plaque which bears an
inscription — that is, the
plaque regarding the war
that the Vietnamese refer
to as "the American War"
v— one can read that "At
the request of the
Republic of South
Vretrrain the United
States began its longest
war against the commu-
nist aggression of North
Vietnam." We are further
told that "support at
home lessened," but there is no further indi-
cation that a large percentage of the popula-
tion of the United States — probably even a
majority — has a very different perception of
that conﬂict.

After all, it strikes sane people as either
mildly ludicrous, nauseatingly deceitful or
both for a powerful govermnent to claim it
invaded a country "at the request of" a pup-

He said

pet government set up by said powerful gov-
ernment. Doubly so when the leaders of said
puppet government (e.g., Ngo Dinh Diem)
could be removed and assassinated at the will
of the leaders of said powerful government

Sane people also ﬁnd it both wildly ludi-
crous and blatantly deceitful for said power-
ful government to claim
that its enemies (who, not
incidentally, had the sup-
portlof the vast majority
of the local population)
were the real "aggressors"
in the region. Doubly so
when the military forces
of said powerful govem-
ment found it necessary to
drop tons of bombs on the
country they were sup-
posedly "defending,"
killing between 2 and 3
million people in the
course of the war.

In this instance,
then, the designers of
Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial are exhibiting
moral blindness. But in
their zeal to follow the
principle of "My country, right or wrong,"
they also occasionally end up on the right
side of things, even if in a roundabout way.

It is refreshing toreadthetruismthatthe
Civil War was fought to repress a rebellion
by "Southem separatists and slaveholders,"
especially in an era when demagogic legisla-
tors adorn statehouses with the racist Stars
and Bars in the name of "Southem Heritage,"

and when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
has dubbed his own Republican Party "the
party of Jefferson Davis," as if that were a
good thing. '

Soldiers and Sailors Memorial can at
least plead consistent, uncritical support of
the United States government in all cases of
war. These folks do not even have that lame
excuse. Isn't it curious that the same people
who ﬂy the ﬂag of the most dangerous trea-
son the country has ever known are also the
people most likely to question the loyalty of
those who opposed the invasion of Vietnam?

It is also true that the apologists for the
Confederacy are among the most fanatical
devotees of Ronald Reagan, and it is here
that one begins to notice a pattern. Reagan
was always fond of tarring opponents of his
Central America policies as closet enemies of
the United States, and yet he paid his respects
at a cemetery in which men were buried
who may very well have participated in the
massacre of American Gls at the Battle of the
Bulge (not to mention millions of defenseless
European civilians, Jewish and non-Jewish).

A contradiction, you may say. But I beg
to differ The pattern is consistent; a tendency
to make apologies for the enemies of this
government when it has been in the right,
and to make excuses for this government
when it has been in the wrong. Such is the
mentality of those who yeam for the bad old
days of this country at its worst, while spurn-
ing the achievements of this country at its
best.

John Lacny is not and has never been a
member of you-lmow-what.

A sports news publication report-
ed late last week that Pitt basketball
players John Finneman and Michael
Shin would not be with the team next
season.

Finneman has since confirmed the
report; Shin, despite many attempts to
contact him, has yet to reply.

The two freshmen saw limited
playing time this year. Finneman
played in one exhibition game before
being sidelined with injuries. Shin
received playing time early in the sea-
son, but was then benched because of
injuries and ineffective play.

Finneman is not sure of his plans
for next school year, but he is sure that
basketball will not be part of them.

“I don’t know what I’m doing at
this point in my life,” said Finneman.
“I just don’t have the desire to play
anymore. I don’t know if I’ll ever play
again.”

Finneman was also adamant that
his quitting the team had nothing to do
with Pitt.

“I have nothing against
Pittsburgh, the school or Coach
Willard,” said Finneman. “This is just
a personal decision.

Shin, shown in an early  s. olre H
Dame, saw few minutes late in the year.

“He [Coach Willard] told me that
if my heart wasn’t in it then I should
do what I want.”

As a high school junior, the 6-
foot-6 shooting guard was one of the
top prospects in Virginia, averaging

/



9 .

19 points and six rebounds. But, a
knee injury early in his senior season
kept him out for the entire year. That
same injury was problematic again
this year and was part of his depar-
ture.

“My leaving has something to do
with my injuries, but that’s not the
only reason,” said Finneman.

Shin‘ could not be reached for
comment after the report —— published
in Big East Basketball Briefs maga-
zine —— but in a phone interview two
weeks ago he said he was thinking
about transferring to another school
where he could see more playing time.

The 6-foot-8 forward from
Richmond,—Va., played 13 games this
season averaging 1.2 points, 1.1
rebounds and shot under 30 percent
from the field.

Panther Notes:

0 Panther recruit Fred Primus out
of Middleburg, Va., scored 24 points
to help the U.S. All-Stars to a 134-129
victory over the Pennsylvania All-
Stars in last night’s Bom2Run All-
Star Game at LaRoche College. He
was 12-20 from the field and sank ﬁve
3—pointers, the most on either team.
The 6-foot-3 Primus averaged 24
points a game at Notre Dame

Connecticut hitter Glenn Katz for the

Katz won the battle convincing-
ly, smashing a high fastball far over

homer that pulled UConn to within

In the bottom of the ninth, with

Coughenour threw a 70-mph curve
that hit the ground before it reached
the plate.

Katz swung. He missed Pitt

header— its only win in its last ﬁve
games — and Coughenour had no
idea what he’d done.

“I didn’t even know he got me
the last time,” said the pitcher, whose
strikeout helped Pitt split Saturday’s
doubleheader with the Huskies. “I’ve

got a real bad memory.”

Perhaps memory didn’t serve
the hurler, but his catcher, David
Hoopes, knew whattodowhenKatz
came back to the plate.

“[Jory] was just throwing all
junk to that number 22,” Hoopes
said “We knew he’d chase it.”

The catcher said

In contrast, the UConn hurlers —

Hoopes notched the game-win-

Katz deep to left ﬁeld for a three-run,

NFL Draft.

While Gonzalez was in junior high
school he discovered the game of football.
He enjoyed a lot of success at Corral Park
High School, and had scholarship offers
from many schools including Miami
University. Gonzalez chose Pitt so he would-
n’t be too close to home and so he could con-
centrate on his studies. “It’s called a career
move choosing Pitt, and coming up here to
this weather,” Gonzalez said

It didn’t seem like much of a career
move for the ﬁrst four years of school.
Gonzalez started a total of. two games for the
Panthers, and things weren’t looking good
for him to play any time soon. “When I got
yanked at the Temple game two years ago, I
thought that was it.”

After the season, Coach Walt Harris
gave new life to Pete Gonzalez’s career.

r “Coach Harris said he wanted to give
everyone a fair chance. I worked harder than
Ieverhadinmy life, andwonthestarting

named to the second-team All-Big East
squad After an eﬂiciency rating of
146.7, 30 touchdowns (a Big East
record), and 2,657 passing yards later,
the 6—foot-1, 210-pound Pete Gonzalez
is preparing for the NFL Draft.

Tony Orlandini

Tony Orlandini started playing
football when he was just 7 years old
Orlandini grew up in West Wyoming,
Pa., where he played high school foot-
ball. Orlandini attributes his motivation
to his parents and older brother Roger.

“My brother and I always pushed
each other and made each other strive
for better things,” Orlandini said before
the Notre Dame game.

The 6-foot-5, 295-pound Orlandini
anchored a line for Wyoming High
School that averaged gaining 300 yards
per game during his senior year.
Wyoming High School also won a
state—AA-class championship under
Tony’s leadership. ‘

Orlandini was recruited by Paul
Hackett (now the head coach at USC),

but played for both Johnny Majors and
Walt Harris. He has been plagued by
knee injuries his entire career — during
the off—season three years ' ago,
Orlandini was forced to have recon-
structive anterior—cruciate—ligament
surgery. VV1th hard work and dedica-
tion, Tony was able to make a corne-
back, only missing two games.

“It was tough and I worked out
three times a day. We have a great staff,
and before I knew it I was ready to go,”
Orlandini said.

The rest is history. Orlandini only
allowed one—and-a—half sacks for the
entire 1997 season. He was a ﬁrst-team
all-conference selection and also played
in the East—West Shrine All-Star game.
Now he is working toward taking his
talent and 295 pounds to the NFL.

Jake Hotfart

Jake Holfart dreamed of playing in
the NBA while growing up. In seventh
grade, however, he discovered football.

Hotfart played basketball and foot-
ball from seventh grade until his gradu-
ation ﬁom Yuba City High School out-
side Sacramento, Calif. He played both
defensive end and wide receiver during
his high school career. The combination
of positions he played is odd, but at an
early age he was bigger than most of his
teammates. '

After graduation, Holfart became
the ﬁrstfreshman in 10 years to startfor
Sacramento State football, while play-
ing baskaball as well. Then a few of
Holfa1t’s coaches took positions else-

where —— Sacramento State’s football
program was in turmoil and Holfart
was forced to either stay and risk his
career, or to take his talents on the road.

Holfart decided to follow Coach
Mike Clemens to the University of
Paciﬁc. Holfart fought the NCAA’ s rule
that transfers must sit out for one full
year because of the turmoil of the
Sacramento State program, and before
Paciﬁc’s sixth game, Holfart won his
appeal.

However, it wasn’t meant to be.

“My dad and I were stacking ﬁre-
wood in our backyard, and he got a
phone call. He told me that the
University of Paciﬁc had dropped their
football program I could have kept my
scholarship  but I had football still left
in me,” Hotfart said

He then considered many schools,
including schools like UCLA. Hotfart
enjoyed his visit to Fit so much he
decided to transfer and play football for
the Panther squad “I saw the national
coverage and who we played and I
decidedto come to Pitt,” Hotfart said

Hoffart had an incredible season
for the Panthers. He set the record for
the most receptions by a Pitt receiver“,
he was Gonzalez’s favorite target, and
he delivered the big play against West
Virginia. Now Jake is setting his sights
on the NFL Draft.

(Wlth the stage set for all three athletes,
tomorrows installment focuses on each
player's attempt to get noticed by the
NFL in postseason workouts.)

fans, players, and money to the University.

The ESPPYs do have a darker side to them, where all
of Pitt’s blunders in sports performances do r1ot go unno-
ticed: ‘

1) Most Disappointing Team: Men’s basketball team, who
went 11-16 and missed a postseason bid 1

2) Most Embarrassing Actions by a Pitt Athlete: Tie. Kirk
McMullen, whose attempt to ﬁght an entire ﬁaternity
brought him legal problems, and Tony Zimmerman, who
led a brawl in a well-known restaurant.

3) Team with the Worst Playing Field’ Pitt baseball, which
plays at Trees Field — often mistaken for a beer league soft-
ball ﬁeld and located in the scenic, gang-infested Hill
District. ' ’
4) Biggest Choke Performance by a Team: The football
team, which blew a 14-point lead against Boston College in
the fourth quarter for a 22-21 loss.

5) Most Difficult to Watch Performance by a Pit Team: The
Lady Panther hoops team, with a 31-point loss to
Connecticut,‘ 87-46.

runs had already scored, Delsignore launched
a triple into deep right-center ﬁeld, scoring
two more and giving Pitt the lead 4-3.

The next inning, UConn took a 5-4

Then, after a brief huddle with Head

COMPETE IN NATIONAL TOURNAMENT

PITTSBURGH, April 1 -- The University of Pittsburgh College Bowl Team
has won the Regional Championships and will compete for the national title at
the College Bowl National Championship Tournament on April 17 -I 19 at the
University of Texas at Dallas.

midway through the second walk, gave up a
two-rim single toAlejandro Rodriguez to give
the Huskies a 9-7 lead

” Then Hoopes took over, and
Coughenour settled down — something,
according to the catcher, Coughenour nor-
mally does. ’~

“He’s been doing real well for us all
year,” Hoopes said of the sophomore pitcher.
“He comes in for us in a lot of tough situations
and he usually gets us out of it”

Unfortunately for the Panthers, game one
of the doubleheader was too tough of a situa-
tion.

In the third inning of that game, senior
Husky co-Captain Billy Rich put Connecticut
on the scoreboard with an RBI single to left
ﬁeld Pittsburgh would retaliate, as second
baseman Han'y Ciavarella continued his
recent offensive surge by ripping a double to
center ﬁeld He would later score on an inﬁeld

The Pitt team beat George Washington University, Georgetown University, and
Carnegie Mellon University in the Regional Championships. The team
members include: team captain Eric Steinhouser, a freshman and chemical
engineering/philosophy major; Niladri Das, a freshman majoring in
neuroscience; Lawrence Eger, a sophomore and bioengineering major; and
Adam Schaible, a junior and business administration/history major. They will
be accompanied by their coach, Joe Wright.

The College Bowl National Championship Tournament is the culmination of a
year’s play on 300 campuses. It features the 15 Regional Champions plus a

l6th wild card team. The tournament format is a full round robin with the top
two teams facing off in a best two-out-of-three ﬁnals. I

The College Bowl has been called “The Varsity Sport of the Mind” and has a
long history on television, radio, and college campuses. It has provided the
arena for college students to demonstrate their skills under the fire of varsity
competition. College Bowl began on October 10, 1953 in new York and
featured only two universities. The competition was nationally televised for 17
seasons and has been cited by-the national PTA and Congress as “entertainment

The 3-2 loss gave Pittsburgh its fourth in a
