Union Calls
For Salary
Adjustment

By TIM DINGER

The faculty union of Pitt has
called‘ for a 9 percent “catch-up"
salary adjustment to “begin making
up for a decade of lost real income,”
the union announced last week.

Professor Philip Wion, president
of the United Faculty, said the raise
is necessary in order to reverse the
long decline in faculty salaries.

“In 10 years, we have lost 20 per-
cent of our purchasing power,"
Wion said. “‘Governor Thornburgh
now is asking the universities to pro-
vide the innovation and research to
bring the commonwealth out of its
severe recession. Such creative effort
cannot happen inan atmosphere of
depressed salaries and discourage-
ment.”

The United Faculty proposal asks
for a 7.5 percent across-the-board
increase for all Pitt faculty, plus 1.5
percent for discretionary funds to be
used in cases of promotion, removal
of inequities, outstanding achieve-
ment and extraordinary merit. The
1.5 percent across-the-board

Grievance
Reaches

State Level

By MARK A. SINDLER

A hearing for the two Pitt Book
Center employees fired in early Jan-
uary was held Monday in the State
Office Building downtown. After an
initial university offer was turned
down by both Charles Delaney and
Tim Brady, approximately three
hours of litigation followed. .

The two former employees and
three others were initially suspended
for one day each at the beginning of
the year for what they believe was
the university's attempt to thwart
union-orgainizing activities.

A hearing examiner from the
Pennsylvania ‘ Labor Relations
Board heard testimony from book-
store supervisors Peter Sollento and
Jesse Peters. Dan Coffman, repre-
sentative from the Allegheny Joint
Regional Board (AJRB), said that
bookstore administrators never
acknowledged union-organizing
attempts by the employees.

“We put people on the stand and
they testified that they saw the
union’s letter on [bookstore direc-
tor] Mary Bonach’s desk,” Coffman
said, “so the bookstore knew that
there was union activity going on.

Nation’s FirstOrgan DonorTransplant Established

By PEGGY FERRI

Pittsburgh, known nationally for
sophisticated organ transplant oper-
ations, is now the headquarters fora
national organ donor hotline estab-
lished by the North American
Transplant Coordination Organiza-
tion (NATCO).

The referral hotline system is the
first of its kind and was started last
month by Pitt’s transplant program
for the purpose of finding organs for
transplanta.tion. The telephone
number, 800-24-DONOR, is for the
use of medical personnel, but not the
general public.

Efforts are being made to better
publicize the hotline number,
according to registered nurse and
transplant coordinator Mary Ann
Palumbi. She said there has been
national publicity of the number and
it has also been published in various
medical journals.

“It [a national system] has been

overdue for a long time,” Palumbi
sririd’.
J" One doctor, for example, who
recently had a potential organ
donor, would not have thought to
get in touch with a transplant pro-
gram if he had not seen the number,
she explained. ~

Hotline operators in Scaife Hall
have received over 200 telephone

calls including potential organ
donor referrals, according to organ
procurement coordinator Brian
Broznick.

To donate organs, Broznick
explained, the donor must have suc-
cumbed to brain death but maintain
the function of vital organs. To
suffer brain death is to be considered
legally dead according to many state
laws, including those of Pennsyl-
vania.

“He [the donor] must be perfectly
healthy but be legally brain dead,"
Broznick said. He added that less
than 2 percent of all people who die
are suitable donors. ~

NATCO has also established a
hotline number for the local area.
Hospitals in the area call DONORS
7 when they have a potential donor.
Organ procurement coordinators
will even talk to the family of the
potential donor and do everything
but the actual recovery, according to
Broznick.

“The idea here is to take the
burden off of the hospital staff,” he
said. With the advent of higher costs
and staff cuts, he explained, nurses
cannot be expected to care for the
potential donor until someone
arrives.

Pittsburgh has 39 children and 41
adults waiting for livers. Kidneys are
also greatly needed. Figures show
that, nationally. over 8,000 patients

await kidneys and of those, 200 are
from Pittsburgh.

Transporting patients to where
operations can be performed might
have been a problem for medical
facilities in the past, but local corpo-

rations have agreed to volunteer
their airplanes for emergencies,
Broznick said.

“They [corporations] have all
been very cooperative and agreed to
fly our surgical teams around,” he

said.

The problem for transplant pro-
grams is doctors and nurses who are
unwilling to approach a family
about organ donation, Broznick

More than 100 cinematolo-
gists, or people who study
movies, met last week at Pitt to
discuss everything from daytime
serials to the avante-garde
cinema, and when it was over,
one of this school‘s best kept
secrets——the film studies
program—let itself be known.

An appearance Friday at
David Lawerence Auditorium
by director Robert Altman
(“M"" A"'S" H," “Nashville”) high-
lighted a tour-day conference of
the Society for Cinema Studies,
held for the first time ever at Pitt.

A crowd of over 800 packed
the auditorium to hear Altman
and viewla screening of his latest
film, “Come Back to the Five and
Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy

Dean.“

Pitt Goes To The

Film and television scholars
from the United States, Canada
and Great Britian delivered pro-
fessional papers on a wide vari-
ety of topics, all of which fell
under the conference theme-
“Genre and Beyond."

The genre theme was devel-
oped by organizers here in an
attempt to give the conference
more of a focus, according to
Lucy Fischer, director of Pitt’s
film studies program and confer-
ence coordinator.

“We thought it was a good
idea to take a" specific problem,
especially a current problem in
film study, and to develop all
aspects of it,” said Marcia
Landy, professor of English at
Pitt and a member of the confer-
ence organizing committee.

Movies

Genre, explained Landy,
encompasses certain narrative
film forms developed over a
period of time. Contemporary
examples of genre include west-
erns, science fiction, melodrama,
musicals and others

The Society of Cinema Studies
approached Pitt with the idea of
hosting the annual event during
last year’s conference held at the
University of California at Los
Angeles. The organizing com-
mittee began working on the pro-
ject as early as last spring.

Fischer called the four-day
event the major film conference
of the year, noting that Pitt
would be joining the company of
such past hosts as Northwestern
and New York University.

Altman Highlights Conference

continued from page one‘-

Organizers here hope that
bringing the conference to Pitt
will give the film studies program
some of the prestige previously
reserved for those at more widely
known institutions.

“I hope that the conference
will solidify our position within
the university and within the
national film community," said
.Dana Polan, as assistant profes-
sor in the English department at
Pitt and a member of the organ-
izing committee. “It will let a lot
of people know that there is a
film studies program here. .I’m
prejudiced, but I think this [con-
ference] is as good if not better
than the others I have attended.”

John Fell, a professor at San
Francisco State University and
outgoing president of the Society

for Cinema Studies, echoed
those sentiments.

“I didn’t realize that the film
studies program at Pitt was as
large and as well organized as I
found it to be,” Fell said. “A con-
ference such as this will familiar-
ize all the people here of that and
they will take those impressions
back to their representative
schools."

Attracting Altman to the con-
ference certainly brings with it an
element of that prestige.

Asked if he was surprised by
the invitation to come here to
Pitt, Altman jokingly replied,
“I’m kind of trashy—I'll go
where ever they invite me."

Long considered one of the
major practitioners of the genre
form, Altman is also its most

“Sollento said he had no knowl-
edge that there was union activity
going on; we find it hard to believe,
though. We also had notices posted
on the lunchroom bulletin board.”

“Coffman and AJRB representa-
tive Tom Schied have been repres-
enting bookstore employees for the
past several months in their attempt
to gain recognition as part of Retail
Wholesale Department Store
Union, Local 101.

University counsel Ron Talarico,
representing Pitt in the case with
Scott Zimmerman from the legal
firm of Reid Smith Shaw & McClay,
said there has to be a line drawn as to
who actually was aware of possible
union recognition.

This fine distinction is necessary,
he added, because the lawsuit is not

over justification of the two firings
but whether the terminations were
issued in retaliation for union-
organizating attempts.‘

“It...matters greatly who knew of
the union activity,” Talarico said.
“Mary Bonach, whether she knew or
not, was not part of these firings.
Testimony will show that it was
Peter So1lento’s decision to fire these
peole, and Peter did not know.

“There’s also a big, big jump
between somebody’s knowing of
some alleged or starting union activ-

’ ity and somebody’s taking action in

retaliation to that.” ,

Talarico believes that because
Coffman and Schied cannot make
the distinction, there is inadequate
evidence that the Book Center acted
illegally.

“Even if you could prove that I
know that the fellows in the shop are
talking about starting up a union,
you still have a quantum leap to now
connect my action in firing you as
being in retaliation for your
attempting to start a union,” Tala-
rico said.

“I think they’re just attempting to
prove the first hurdle—that we
somehow know about it, and Ithink
their proof is weak at best,” he
added.

Coffman and Scheid also

included as part of their case the fact -

that Sollento did not confront Brady
and Delaney, as required in the
handbook of university guidelines,
before firing both individuals
because of alleged physical threats
against both Sollento and Peters.

“We’re not here to decide whether
they were fairly fired or not,” Tala-
rico said. “The issue and the only
issue before the hearing examiner is
whether whatever action was
taken—I don’t care if it. was correct
or incorrect——was that action taken
in retaliation for them in trying to
exercise their unionizing rights.

“I’m not too concerned with dot-
ting i’s and crossing t’s in the
handbook.”

It was this oversight, not follow-
ing university guidelines, which Cof-
fman says led to unfair
unemployment action taken against
Brady and Delaney.

“On page 18 or 19, I’m not sure
which,” Coffman said, “it says that
the supervisor will make every
attempt to investigate and find out
the facts of the case, and Sollento
admitted that he never talked to Del-
aney or Brady. .

“But he fired them without talking
to "them directly. He never got their
side of the story,” Coffman said.

The A} RB representative also

- ~pointed out——that---Sollento-~ took-

action against Brady and Delaney
after hearing that both directed
threats at Peters and Bonach. But,
Coffman said, Sollento admitted on
the stand that he didn’t hear those
comments directly.

Before the hearing started, both
parties worked at coming to a com-
promise. Although neither side
granted specifics of the offer turned
down by Brady and Delaney, it is
known that one was offered a $7 per
hour union position with Pitt in
another area.

The other former employee was
offered nothing at all by Pitt and
would not qualify for unemploy-
ment compensation.

Coffman recounted the 10-minute
conference Brady and Delaney had
in pondering the offer. “The one
individual said to the other. ‘I’m not
going to sell you out—I’ll stand
behind you.’ He gave up a $7 per
hour job, on principle, and you‘ve
got to admire someone like that.”

noted parodist. In addition to his
commercially successful works,
Altman has directed ﬁlms cover-
ing many genres: the western
(“McCabe and Mrs. Miller"), the
ganster film (“Theives Like Us”)
and the musical comedy (“The
Perfect Couple.")

“He [Altman] has been one of
the most important recent film-
makers, especially in terms of
genre,” Polan said. “He not only
has been making films in the
genre mold, but also he has been
changing that mold.”

In her introduction of Altman,
Fischer described the director as
“going beyond the breed” of
filmmakers who work within
each genre category.

In a question and answer ses-
sion after the film, Altman
remarked, “I think there is an ele-
ment of danger in talking about
your work. I find this somewhat
dangerous, but I just make sure I
don’t say anything I might hear.”

Nevertheless, Altman agreed
that conferences such as this are
worthwhile.

“I think the exposure is the
most important thing,” Altman
said. “Anytime there is an
exchange between people with
the same interest it is beneficial.
You can learn more from each
other than from the so-called
experts.”

Fell thinks that film studies
programs and their graduates are
having an increasing affect on
the filmmaking industry.

“The older generation of film
scholars such as myself didn’t
have the benefit of film studies
programs,” Fell said. “These
programs are affecting the way
films are made and the way we
perceive them.”

 Making A

Point

Institutions like the press are constantly
under attack for being too big, too subjective,
too unaccountable. It is easy for the press to
dismiss such attacks as the disgruntled rum-
blings of a vocal minority-—it is also easy to
lose complete credibility.

The masses, as the media refer to diverse
groups of individuals, have a point. News-
papers, television and radio stations who
choose to ignore public outcry will pay for it
later.

Many televisions panels, press club lun-

cheons and news close-ups have been devoted
to the role and responsibility of the media,
with ever more attention focused since Stern
magazine brought and published the alleged
Hilter diaries. That constant search for a
scoop feedsxthe false generalization that the
media act irresponsibly and cost other publi-
cations some of their credibility—a chain
reaction. V r
, Those who attack the media on -the
grounds that they abuse their privileges and
the public trust are not correct in damning
the entire profession of journalism, but they
are justified in demanding accuracy.

Objectivity as the public thinks of it doesn’t
exist. As a recent panel on “Nightline” con-
cluded, the journalist can’t be objective, but
he can be fair, and he should be accurate.

A recent Gallup pool revealed that hostil-
ity toward the media is the strongest it’s ever
been. The media would do well to admit their
mistakes and not try to fortify an image of

, infallibility.

There is educating to be done among the
public as well. They have to learn the media is
a human collective capable of human mis-
takes. They have to stop blaming the media
for what is wrong in the world. /

The media have power because of the trust
granted them. It is foolish to act in an irres-
ponsible way that could betray that trust.

Eckankar Religion Explained

Dear Editor:

I am an ECKist. For over 10 years
I have studied the teachings of Eck-
ankar as I’ve worked towards gain-
ing a deeper understanding of myself
and the universe I live in. I work
full-time as a computer systems ana-
lyst for a manufacturing company in
Bloomfield. Every evening, in my
home, I spend twenty minutes in
contemplation, performing the spir-
itual exercises of Eckankar. And
once a week or so, I meet with other
local ECKists at the Oakland Eck-
ankar Center to study the writtem
materials and discuss topics of mut-
ual interest.

It is a lifestyle which allows me to
deepen my spiritual understanding
while maintaining my responsibili-
ties to my job, my family and my
community——a lifestyle shared by
many thousands of Pittsburghers in
dozens of other religions and spirit-
ual teachings.

I came across a section in this
newspaper which claimed that I,
along with other members of Eckan-
kar, were in fact “cultists” (Inside
Story, March 9, 1983). The article
went on to say that we were “cen-
tered around a blind authority,”that
l have “sacriﬁced my individuality”
and that, reportedly, I am “no longer
responsible for my own decisions.”

These allegations are ridiculous,
as even a superficial examination of
the Eckankar teachings would show.
Eckankar is first and foremost a
path of personal freedom and
responsibility and is no more a cult
than Judaism, Christianity or any
other mainstream religion.’

What is -Eckankar? Simply stated,
it is an individual, spiritual teaching
which provides the sincere seeker
with the tools to gain a great, per-
sonal understanding of God. These
tools are the spiritual exercises of
Eckankar, a set of techniques are
simple, natural, and (they) do not
involve the use of drugs or any other
artificial means. The ECKist learns
how to discover truth for himselfnot
by blindly accepting the words of a
priest, minister or charismatic
leader, but by personal experience,
through_tech_niq_ues taught for cen-

Columns

The Pitt News encourages
and accepts column submis-
sions from interested faculty,
students and staff. All sub-
missions should be typed and
double-spaced on non-
erasable paper. The subject
matter is left -to the discretion
of the author. All submis-
sions should be addressed to
The Pitt News, Fourth Floor
Schenley Hall, and should
include the writer’s name,
phone number and university

affiliation,

turies by the ECK Masters.

ECKists do not live in communes,
ashrams or spiritual communities.
There are no rituals, no dogmas, no
churches and no priestcraft. There is
no tithing and no physical require-
ments of any kind. The entire teach-
ing of Eckankar consists of
developing the personal and direct
relationship between the individual
and ECK, or Spirit.

While cults often proselytize, Eck-
ankar in no way seeks converts or
tries to persuade others to drop what
they're doing and join. Every ECK-
ist who I’ve ever met is on this path
solely through personal choice and
understands enough about the spir-
itual law of non-interference not to
try to convince another person to do
or think anything. Sometimes I wish
that members of certain “respecta-
ble” religions had a similar under-
standing of this law. -

I’ve thought quite a bit about the

article about cults that appeared in

this paper and similar articles that
occasionally appear in the print
media. I don't really know why some
people and some organizations
insist on labeling Eckankaras a cult

when it doesn’t meet any of the crite- .

ria of a cult. It seems, though, that
there are at least three categories of
these people.
‘ In the first category are those peo-
ple who, apparently, are convinced
that anyone who follows a spiritual
path different from the one that they
follow is committing a grievous sin,
and these people consider it to be
their sacred duty to stamp out such
“unbelievers.” There’s not much I
can say to someone who considers
my very existence to be a personal
affront, but hopefully, the Constitu-
tion of the United States will suffice
to keep these peoples’ activities
somewhat limited.

Then there seems to be a number
of people who have had a bad ex-
perience with another religion or
pseudo-religious path which turned
out to be, in fact, a'cult. These peo-
ple often band together into organi-
zations designed to combat cults and
support techniques such as depra-
gramming. While these individuals
have an understandable suspicion of

anything unfamiliar, I would simply
ask them to investigate each patlit
with a sincere and open attitude and
not to judge before theyunderstand.

' And finally, there are the journal-
ists and shapers of public opinion
who may have no personal or reli-
gious ax to grind, but who see the
“cult issue” as an opportunity to
increase readership and gain atten-
tion. These individuals, who are
considered by their readers to be
authorities simply by virtue of their
access to the media, may decide to
run a feature on “the cult menance”
or “cults in Pittsburgh.” They then
attempt to fill a certain amount of
space with whatever truths, half-
truths, allegations and lies they can
collect in a limited amount of time '
These people, despite their lack of
bad intentions, can in fact do more ‘
harm than anyone in the other two
categories because they are per-
ceived as being impartial. The harm
that they can do, and the misinfor-‘
mation and ignorance that they
spread, is far greater than they
suspect.

A journalist has a clear responsi-.
bility to his or her readers to tho-
roughly research a topic and then
present it in a fair and balanced way.
If the writers and editors of this
newspaper had fulfilled their
responsibility, they would not have
made the unfounded allegations that
they did. V

Nobody has a monopoly on the
truth. It can be found in Christianity
and in Judaism, in the arts and in the
sciences, in the Asian paths of yoga /
and in the spirituality of the Ameri-
can -Indian. For myself and
hundreds of others in the Pittsburgh
area, truth can be found through the
teachings and spiritual exercise of
Eckankar. It is not up to me or
anyone else to dictate what another
person should believe, or which path
he should follow. If the founding’
fathers of the United States felt it
necessary to safeguard the individu-
al’s freedom of religion in the Con-
stitution, it hardly» seems right for
any of us, through carelessness or
through design, to deny it to our
fellow Americans in our own time.

The Pitt News, Wednesday May 11, 1983

‘I Love The Nightlife!’

With spring here and most
Pitt students at home until the
fall, remaining students often
find it hard to meet people and
find things to do in Oakland
besides study and lay out in front
of the Cathedral.

Although there is a drop,
sometimes dramatic, in the busi-
ness of local bars over the
summer, nightspot owners say
that many students still frequent
the bars during the off-beat

‘ months.

Barney Silverman, one of the
owners of Zelda’s Greenhouse,
the Wooden Keg and, most
recently, Gustine’s, said that
there is “somewhat of a drop” in
bar business over the summer.

“It's only natural because the
kids aren’t here,” Silverman
said. “Every business in Oak-

’ land has somewhat of a drop.”

Business doesn’t suffer drasti-
cally, Silverman said, because
many young people who live in
Pittsburgh and go to school out-
side of the city come home for
the summer——and visit the bars.

 

ny’s Pub, said that college stu-
dents comprise one-quarter to
one-half of Danny’s usual crowd.
He attributes their summer
crowd to “whoever’s left over
the summer and regular
workers.”

Nick Leventis, one of the
owners of the Santuary, attrib-
utes half of their fall and winter
crowd to college students but
said that “we really get busy here
in the summertime.”

During the summer, the Sanc-
tuary’s clientele consists of an
older, working crowd, he said.

“It’s a mellow crowd out to
have a drink and enjoy itself,”
Leventis said. The customers
aren’t fighting the cold outside
or anything.” ’

Although business at Danny’s
drops over the summer, “lt’s still
usually college students,”
according to bartender Pat
Horn.

“A lot of students who come
here go to school year round,”
Horn said.

Some Oakland nightspots

 

revamp their image over the
summer. One of these bars is
The Decade, which is trying to
replace its “bad reputation” with
that of a collegiate hang-out.

‘Although there Is a
drop (sometimes
dramatic) In the
business of local
bars over the sum-
mer, night spot
owners say that
many students stlll
frequent the bars
durlng the oft-beat
months.’

“There used to be a lot of trou-
ble down here,” Decade man-
ager Bill Pascale said. “That
doesn’t happen anymore. We’re
trying to turn it around and get
some new people down here.”

catered to a “young adults
crowd” featuring bands such as
The Nighthawks, Billy Price,
Norm Nardini, the Silencers and
The Core. Big-name bands have
been one source of The
Decade’s trouble, Pascale said.

“We get some transients, peo-
ple who follow the bands
around,” he said. “There’s some
trouble there sometimes.”

“We’re going to be starting
this summer to get things
going,” Pascale said. “We don’t
do a whole lot of business with
students down here, so we're
going to work on that.

“A lot of students don’t know
The Decade’s here. We’re going
to be starting specials and stuff
aimed toward the college crowd
over the summer.”

Although The Decade hasn’t
started with specials yet, the
manager is thinking about con-
tests or discount nights. The
Decade already features live
music Tuesday through Sunday
nights. Every Thursday night is a
beer blast with no cover charge

Another lo mg tspot in the
process of an image change is
the Luna Restaurant. A little off
the beaten track, the Luna is
carding heavily to keep out their
previous inﬂux of underage
drinkers.

“We get a lot of students, but
it's a neighborhood bar more
than anything,” said Gil Sokol,
one of the Luna’s owners. “We
have a pretty good cross-section
of people who come in here.”

On some Saturday nights, a
disc jockey plays records from
the 19605 and early 70s and on
some nights they feature a live
guitar player.

Upstairs at Mr. C.’s is another
Oakland bar currently in a tran-
sitional period. According to
manager David Soloman, Mr.
C’s now features a variety of
bands, from new wave to coun-
try rock, on weekends, but the
new owners are planning live
bands five nights a week.

About half of Mr. C’s clientele
consisted of students during the

Gustine’s, previously owned
by former baseball player Fran-
kie Gustine, recently changed
hands, too.

“We don’t really know what
direction we’re going to take
there yet,” said new owner Sil-
verman. He plans to continue
with blue.grass music on Friday

Most local bars have an after-
noon Happy Hour in addition to
evening specials (see chart).

For those who like to gaze at
the summer stars before or after
visiting the bars, the Pittsburgh
Department of Parks and
Recreation sponsors outdoor
movies on Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park on Sunday and
»Wednesday evenings.

Many Oakland nlghtspots otter afternoon specials for
drinking and getting together.

At Zelda’s Greenhouse, Sil-
verman will continue the spe-
cials over the summer. These
include Taco Night on Tuesdays
and Progressive Night on Thurs-
days, when drinks start out inex-
pensive and progress hourly to
their regular prices.

On Monday nights, Zelda’s
has an open stage, “if you want
to play an instrument or sing or
do whatever you do,” Silverman
said.

The Wooden Keg, adjacent to
Gustine“s, will continue its
Thursday night beer blast over
the summer, as well as its pro-
motion nights on Fridays, where
reductions for different drinks
are given at various times.

Danny’s Pub still runs a 2-for-1
special on Wednesday nights in
the summer, and a disc jockey is
on hand on Wednesday, Thurs-
day and Friday nights.

The Sanctuary’s summertime

plans include a new wave disc

jockey on Monday evenings, a
beer blast from 8 p.m. to mid-
night on Tuesdays, and a variety
of live bands (featuring every-
thing from rock to jazz to reg-
gae) on Wednesday nights.
The Sanctuary also offers
aerobic dance classes on some

. Saturday aftetnoenﬁ ,  . , . .  

The movies will start running
in June and begin at dusk. All
types of movies (contemporary
and oldies, comedies and hor-
rors) are featured, and there is a
live band before each ﬁlm.

“lt’s just entertainment for the
public in the summertime,” said
Parks and Recreation program
coordinator Gary Kaboly. “lt’s a
way to take advantage of the
outdoors and the parks.”

.ei.€?’

Kaboly said the turnout
ranges from a few hundred to
several thousand, depending on
the weather and the popularity
of the film. The largest crowd
ever at a Flagstaff movie was
7,000.

All age groups attend the
movies, which are paid for by
Pittsburgh 9 taxes, but “the
majority of the crowd is from 18
to 35,” according to Kaboly.

Despite the campus’ seem-
ingly deserted appearance, Oak-
land offers ample opportunities
for students to eat, drink and
meet while fighting the heat of
summertime.

increase would be 4 percent above
last year’s inﬂation rate and would,
according to the union, allow for
catching up in five years if the same

policy was continued.

Wion emphasized that the salary
request was in line with a recommen-
dation of the University Senate
Council which recently voted
unanimously to support raises sub-

, stantially above last year's increase

in the U.S. Price Index.

“ ‘Substantial increase’ is the
wording used by the Senate Coun-
cil," Wion said, “We think that 9
percent is a reasonable target. We
hope that the administration will
assign the very highest priority to
these increases in faculty and staff
salaries.

“Salary increases are just one ele-
ment of expenditures the university
faces. Weare just trying to get the
faculty and staff to become a prior-
ity instead of being forced to wait for
whatever is left over.”

According to Wion, a report from

’ the National Commission of Expen-

diture in Education reported that
“the neglect of education in America
in the last 15 years ‘has endangered
the country's ability to meet eco-
nomical, social, and political chal-
lenges that are ahead.”

“It calls for' increases in public
support in education at all levels,”
Wion said. “What we [United
Faculty] are saying fits right into the
figures that showed faculty salaries
at Pitt have declined 20 percent over
the last 10 years.”

The United Faculty is working
toward negotiating for all the faculty
by getting the power of collective
bargaining. It has so far persuaded
45 percent of the faculty in the pro-
vost’s area to sign cards requesting a
collective bargaining election.

The provost’s area include all
faculty of the College of Arts and
Sciences, several professional
schools and the four branch
campuses.

“In contrast to United Faculty,
collective bargaining is the best way
to pursue our goals,” Wion said.
“When the United Faculty has col-
lective bargaining, it will be in a bet-
ter position to insist that our needs
be met, and we are convinced that
there is strong faculty support for
the increases we have proposed.

“Salaries at state-owned colleges
and universities are in many cases
better than at Pitt, especially in the
lower ranks like associate professors
and instructors. Other universities
are doing better due to the fact that
they have strong unions and they

SHAPE UP FOR SUMMER

Come One, Come All! Now is the time to
beat the battle of the bulge and get your
body into shape for summer. If you have
five or more pounds to lose, come and
see Patty Verdi, the nutritionist at the
StudentHealth Service. You will be pro-
vided with idividualized counseling and a
personalized diet plan custom made to fit
’ your nutritional needs. So take advan-
tage of this free offer and make an
appointment. Appointments available

days, 2 pm to 8 pm. Call 624-5240.

 
  
 

  

 
   
     
   
   
   
   
   
   
       

have been bargaining effectively for
many years. Declining salaries is
wide spread, but that does not make
our position any better.”

According to Wion, the increases
are necessary to maintain faculty
and to attract younger scholars.

“For the schools of engineering
and sciences, it is hard to hire profes-
sors because the salaries are far
behind the salaries in private com-
panies,” he said.

He also pointed out that Pennsyl-
vania must be especially aware of the
salary decline because its economy
depends so heavily on steel and said
Pennsylvania needs a more ﬂexible
economy, which" would require a
more highly educated work force.

The United Faculty was formed
last year from a merger of the Pitt
Chapter of the American Associa-
tion of University Professors
(AAUP) and the Pitt Professional
Union.

United Faculty is presently affil-
iated with the AAUP and the Ameri-
can ‘Federation of Teachers, but
Wion insists all decisions regarding
wage increases and collective bar-
gaining remain local.

“We make all our own policy deci-

sions. It’s not like outsiders tell us,

what to do," he said. “Once we get
collective bargaining, a contract will
be negotiated by the faculty and
voted on by the faculty at Pitt."
Collective bargaining was tried
before at Pitt in 1976, but in the

_,Pitt’s Faculty Union Calls For Salary Hike

deciding election, only 40 percent
favored the union, and 60 percent
were against it. Wion, however,
believes that the support right now

,in the faculty is much better than it

was in 1976.

said, not a shortage of donors,
although pediatric donors are less
frequent.

Over 80 percent of families who
have suffered a death agree about

the benefits of organ donation,"

according to Broznick.

“They see it as something positive
coming from their loss,” he said,
“and that’s really what it is."

Concerning the difficulty of edu-
cating doctors and nurses, however,
coordinators go into area hospitals
to remedy the situation.

“We [coordinators] sit and talk
with medical personnel to try and
make them aware of the benefits of
suggesting organ donation to fami-
lies,” Broznick explained. “More
physicians are becoming aware and
it’s getting better.

“Not many feel we are ambulance
chasers or waiting around like vul-
tures," Palumbi said. She added
that, as transplants become more

common, people are able to see the
benefits.

The popular belief that there is no
organization in the number of organ
recovery programs is one created by
the media, according to Broznick.

“There are 110 programs in this
country that share vital organs and
kidneys," he said. “And now there is
a national one.”

In the much-publicized case of
Jamie Fisk, a girl in need of a liver
transplant operation, the organ was
found after her father went to the
media with his plea. Broznick said,
however, this does not mean the
organ could not have been found
another way.

Another purpose of the hotline is
to stop people from going to the
public, according to Broznick.

“It’s no longer newsworthy, and ,

people are becoming fed up with it,”
he said. He explained the recovery of
organs has become a ghoulish activ-
ity to the media, a connotation that
is not accurate. ’

o Support Dramatizes

By MARK A. SINDLER

Four years ago, Pitt volleyball
coach Ray Reilly herded together
several committed players and
embarked on a voyage he hoped

would someday take the team to the
top in the East.

He never made it.

Due to departmental politics,
inﬂation, a lack of particular interest
or whatever, Reilly and his bank of

Track Invitational
Attracts Big Talent

By CHARLIE O'HARA

—This Saturday, the Pitt track team
will host a field of 26 teams in the
Pitt Invitational at Pitt Stadium. It
is the only major college invitational
in the Pittsburgh area, and many
area athletes will perform.

For the Panther coaches, John
Vasvary and Steve Lewis, it will be
their first invitational, and they have
some basic ideas as to what the meet
will mean.

“It's a qualifying meet," Vasvary ‘

said. “Most of the teams competing
are using the opportunity to qualify
for the NCAA or ICAA meets. As
for the Division II and Ill teams,
they will be vying for spots in their
respective national meets."

There will be several quality teams
at the meet from the Division I, in
addition to some outstanding lower-
division runners.

The Big Ten Conference sends
three representatives: Ohio State

»

which boasts Del Ray Feagin, 13.8
in the I 10 meter high hurdles, Scott
Wall, 7-2 in the highjump, and Mike
Anderson, 1:48.61 in the 800-meter
run; Wisconsin, the ’82 NCAA
Cross Country champs, adding
strength to the distance events; and
Purdue, which will bring a well-
balanced, competitive team.
Eastern Michigan, known for its
outstanding relay teams, is sche-

duled to compete. The Naval
Academy, with Dallas Roper
entered in the 1500-meter run,

should be competitive. Roper is a
junior, originally from Fox Chapel.
West Virginia will also be among the
Division I schools present.

There will be two Pittsburgh area
teams competing, Carnegie-Mellon
and Robert.Morris. Although the
Tartans will be without the services
of two-time All-America Central
Catholic grad Mike Short, their
President's Athletic Conference title
is proof enough ‘that they have

mnlinmwl rm f)ag(' (‘trawl

10 received their last rites during the
third week in April.

That was when Pitt finished its
season in the Eastern Collegiate Vol-
leyball League playoffs, held at
Penn State. Before that season ever

 

i

started, athletic director Edward
Bozik announced that this would be
the final year for NCAA varsity vol-
leyball at Pitt.

At the time, Bozik detailed‘ how
cutting corners every year had
finally reached the point where more
drastic changes were in order.
Accordingly, Panther volleyball
would be no more.

Dissent since then has come from
everywhere. Interestingly enough,
though, not much was made of the
fact that volleyball is the emerging
sport of the times, just as indoor
soccer was when the MISL was
created several years ago.

Dreams fade fast, however, and
Reilly's wilted quicker than yester-
day‘s tulips. The boys knew what
was ahead of them back in January
and learned to deal with the prospect
of no tomorrow.

But when it came time for postsea-
son play and possible rewards for
earlier toiling, the administration
handed them an empty bankbook.
Already the funds had dried up.

That was April 16, the day the
Panthers were to leiive for Boston

By SCOTT DELLETT

Pitt baseball coach Bobby Lewis
could only imagine how good the
1983 Panthers would have been—if
the rains would have stopped in
April.

Lewis has a goal of 20 wins this

season, but that was «washed out '

along with Trees Field. Pitt has had
an incredible 17 rainouts, including

- a period of two weeks of practicing
outdoors.

With the break in the weather, the
Panthers have been playing virtually
every day and the results have
shown. Pitt has won 11 out of the
last 14 games including wins over

Bucknell, 8-7 in l0 innings Monday ,_

and Gettysburg, ll-8 yesterday. ‘

A l6-hit attack led the Panthers
over Gettyburg as catcher Tim
Schwadron hit a two-run home run
in the sixth inning. The senior back-
stop also had two other hits and
drove in a third run as Pitt scored 10
of its 11 runs in the middle four
innings.

Senior lefthander Tim McAloon
replaced starter Tom Seebacher to
pick up his second win of the season.
McAloon stuck out eight batters in
five innings of work and allowed
four hits, although he walked five. A

According to Lewis, both the
pitching and hitting were affected by
the long layoff,‘ but the entire team is
starting to gel.

“I wish the beginning of the sea-

son was like it is no.w,” he said. ‘-‘In__

the last two weeks we have been
playing well since we have had the
opportunity to play nearly every
day.”

Even though the team was able to
practice indoors during the incle-
ment weather, it wasn’t the same as
playing outdoors.

“The long layoff hurt us; it’s not
the same hitting in the Field House
as it is in a game," Lewis said. “When
we played Kent Stateyou could tell

-—-Page 9 it

The Pitt News, Wednesday ‘May 11, 1983

]

how the rainiaffected us———we were '

way off with our hitting.”

Now the Panthers are in mid-
season form. Besides being able to
play a lot of games in a short period
of time, the team doesn’t have to
worry about school. .

“It’s obvious that the pressure was
on the players with ﬁnals,” Lewis
said. “School is important to the
players. They come to Pitt for an
education, not to prepare for profes-
sional baseball. Baseball is an extra-
curricular activity.” V

The only thing Lewis would like
to have is a longer season, especially
‘the way Pitt has played recently.

“I wish we could play all
summer,” Lewis said. “We wouldn’t

_have to worry about rescheduling all

those games.”

With the goal of 20 wins impossi-
ble to accomplish, Pitt would like to
achieve a winning season and hopes
for a better season in 1984.

l

- PANTHER PATTER: Third base-

man Tom Horew leads the Panthers
in hitting with a .430 average. Short-
stop Paul Westwood is second, hit-
ting at a .403 clip. He leads the team
in runs batted in with 22. Second
baseman Mike Miller leads Pitt in
homers with 4....In the pitching
department, Aaron Krause leads the
staff in wins, complete games,
innings pitched, strikeouts and is
second in earned run average....K-
rause and Frank Craska are starting
pitchers today against the Nittany
Lions....Lewis said he would like to
see the Big East establish a baseball
conference. “It would bea real com-
petitive conference,” he said.

.“Rivalry would be established."

Another benefit of having a confer-
ence: the champion would gain an
automatic berth in the NCAA
regionals. Pitt, being an independ-
ent in baseball, has little chance of

. gaining such an honor due to the

schedule played and the number of
games rained out. ‘

Inevitable End

and the ECVL quarter-round play-
offs. According to Reilly, the budget
would have covered a plane ride to
Newark, but that was‘it.

“We did pay for it out of budget—
my budget,” Reilly said. “We had
money to ﬂy to Newark, then could
have driven five hours to Boston,
but we wouldn’t have made it.

“The school really didn’t care one
way or the other.”

The embarrassing insult was still
left to come after Pitt defeated
Albany State (15-4, 15-8, 15-4) and
Harvard (15-12, 15-9, 15-4) during
Sunday's earlier hours. Later in the
day, the Panthers found out they
would be spending the evening in the
airport. Not in a hotel, but in chairs
and on the floor.

“ I think myiwhole

problem up there is
that nobody seems to
care about anything

other than football or
basketball.” .

The height of the athletic depart-
ment’s disinterest in the team——as if
it wasn't evident yet—surfaced one
week later, April 22, when all the
players had to finance their trip to
Penn State for the, ECVL finals.

“I talked with Walt Cummings

a [assistant athletic dlrector].a_nd ‘he.

1

said if we could make it out of our
budget, we could go,” Reilly said.
“That was all he said. What I’m try-
ing to get across‘ is that the school
was willing to offer no assistance—it
was quite a hardship on the players,
seeing that we had to sleep in the
airport Sunday night.

“I don’t have any problem with
the administration,” Reilly said.
“They’re doing their job as they see

\

fit. I find some problems with the ‘

way they do,their job.

“All there is are the constant
roadblocks, which bothered me
‘more than anything. There's never
any support. ‘Did you get your
financial reports in, did you do that?’
There's never any ‘Well, how did you
do, congratulations’ or a small pat

. on the back,” Reilly said.

The whole experience for Reilly
culminated when it came time to
travel north for the playoffs.

“There was no help getting me to
_Boston," Reilly said. "Not so much
financing, but I had to do all the
work myself. You know, here we
qualified for an Eastern champion-

ship playoff, and nobody seems to

care . ~-

“I think my whole problem up
there is that nobody seems to care
about anything other than football
or basketball.”

Now that the anger has cooled to a
simmer, Reilly, a middle-aged man
who’s raising three kids and working

c'onti,nuec1 on .bag.'e . ten .

Clim a x Inevitable For Reilly

('ont1'nu(*d from [mgr Illllf’

fulltime as an on-site plumber, isn‘t
sure what the future holds.

Of the several avenues he says are
open to him, he is considering
coaching at the college or high
school level or perhaps officiating at
either level. He is also currently
pondering an opening for a coach at
Franklin Regional High School.

“As far as coaching goes, [the last
five years] _ have been extremely
enjoyable,” he said. ‘‘I’ve enjoyed
working with the kids; travelling and

’ meeting people. I’ve really even

enjoyed meeting most of the people
at Pitt. It just bothers me that_ the
administration is not more suppor-
tive of minor sports.”

Reilly will be available next sea-
son in a supportive role as under-
classmen pursue a possible club
status for Pitt‘ volleyball." Such
arrangements now exist at Notre
Dame, Army,. Penn and many
others. '

Sometime soon, once the club is

established at Pitt, it hopes to hook _

up ‘with ones at Clarion, IUP and

Edinboro and create a Western Div- "ﬂ

ision in the ECVL.
“I will always be in touch with the

. game. It"ll never get away from me—-

once it gets in your blood it‘s pretty
hard to shake. It’s been in my blood
for a long time."

He goes back long and far in say-
ing that. He played for Penn Hills in
1965 when the Indians won the
PIAA state championship.

Reilly was never afforded that
chance to win any type of champion-
ship at Pitt.
