Massive Open Online
Courses meet mixed reviews

Susan Snyder
M CT Campus

PHILADELPHIA — The University of
Pennsylvania is at" the forefront of a
movement to experiment with free open
online courses, but the undertaking, as
its own researchers are ﬁnding out, has
yielded mixed results.

While Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCS) have attracted millions of

viewers and been heralded as a poten- '

tial way to address skyrocketing tuition,
very few of their viewers — 4 percent,
on average —— actually complete the
courses, according to the latest study by

researchers in Penn’s Graduateschool A

of Education.

Many who register drop off after the
ﬁrst week or two, the researchers found
in a study they will present Thursday at

a MOOC conference at the University of
Texas-Arlington. About half who regis-
tered viewed at least one lecture.

The results come on the heels of an-
other Penn study, released last month,
that showed a vast majority of students
enrolled in MOOCS already hold college
degrees and are taking the courses pri-
marily to advance in their jobs, which
called into question the notion that the
courses were providing greater access
to the world’s underprivileged.

“The technology offers some prom-
ise of a new approach to addressing
both” costs and access, said Laura Per-
na, a lead researcher on the new study.
“We just don’t know to what extent this
is going to be more than a promise.”

The researchers looked at 1 million

plicants’ social media may override academics, leadership  

Isaiah Brown
For The Pitt News

Social media has often been celebrat-
ed as a new form of communication, a
means of self-expression and creating
identity, —— but it may also be a danger
to students applying for college.
Recent data suggests that high school
seniors should be less focused on what
they put down on paper and-more fo-

cused on what they post on social media
websites. '

On Oct. 31, The Kaplan Test Prep As-
sociation surveyed college admissions
ofﬁcers and found that 29 percent have
Googled applicants’ Facebook pages to
learn more about them.

Seppy Basili, vice president of the
Kaplan Test Prep Association, said this
is a growing trend.

“There’s deﬁnitely greater acknowl-

edgment and acceptance of this prac-
tice now than there was ﬁve years ago,” I
Basili said in a statement.

In a separate study of Kaplan stu-
dents who tookthe SAT or ACT, 50 per-
cent of students said they were “not at
all concerned” with how results of an
online search would negatively impact
their acceptance chances. Only 14 per-
cent of students said they were “very
concerned.”

The same survey also found that 26
percent of individuals had untagged
themselves-from photos, 22 percent
changed their searchable names and
12 percent deleted their proﬁles alto-
gether. ‘ O '

With technology increasingly domi-

' nating modern life, social media is be-
- coming more prevalent, as well. This

raises the question of how the social
media spectrum following this new age

of technology affects college applicants’ ‘

chances of acceptance.

Amber Howe, a Woodland Hills High
School student applying to Carnegie
Mellon University, said_she paid atten-

tion to how she would look to college ,

admissions ofﬁcers who searched for
I
her onhne.
“The whole reason I created a Face-

’ book page was just in caselthe college

admissions ofﬁcers decided to Google
me,” Howe said. “It would give them a
chance to get to know me betterbeyond
an inter_vi_ew.’’ ,

Her  Shane Howe, had a dif-
ferentilperspective. A freshman at the
University of Chicago, he said he be-
lieved he ruined his chances of getting in
to the college he desired, the University
of Notre Dame, “because of things [he]
posted on the Internet.”

“Social media has had a negative im-
pact on me,” Shane said.

“I was so caught up in_the fun of being
in high school,” he said.

However, both the University of
Notre Dame and Pitt deny that they
monitor applicants’ social media pres-

 

based on the information the applicant
provides. The admissionscommittee
does not search for additional informa-
tion via any search engines, including
Google,” Lantz said.

i “The ,~who|efreason I created a
<Faceboo‘k page was just in case
the coliege admissions officers
decided to Google me.”

Amber Howe F

.ence and stated they do not Google
search their applicants’ names for fur-

ther information. .
Joyce Lantz, the director of communi-
cations and recruitment for Notre Dame,
said an examination of social media “is
not a part of the.application process.”
. “We read applications holistically

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele described
a similar policy at Pitt. ,

“The University of Pittsburgh does
not scan the _Internet to ﬁnd personal
information about applicants as part of
the review process for undergraduate
admissions at the Pittsburgh campus,”
he said. ' '

 

This begs the question of whether
the social media spectrum is beneﬁ-
cial to prospective college students or
should be seen as a pitfall for unwary
applicants. .

Christine Brown, Executive Direc-
tor-of K-12 and college prep programs
for Kaplan Test Prep, said that having
a social media account can be either a
blessing or a curse.

“The social media sw’ord cuts both
ways. It’s deﬁnitely a two-way street,
and we think it’s a healthy thing for stu-
dents to maintain an active social me-
dia life, as long as they are being smart
about it,” Brown said.

She suggested that as long as it is
properly used, the outcome should be

' «advantageous for students’ long-term

goals. She provided. the examples of ath-
letes posting videos of successful plays,

- or artists using Instagram or Pinterest
“to share their portfolios.

' “If you are-an accomplished mu-

.‘ sician, maybe you can post videos of

yourself in concert. These are all things
‘that could conceivably help you get into

college if seen by an admissions ofﬁcer,” _

Brown said. I

users who registered for the 16 free
courses offered fromjune 2012 to June
2013, among them “Calculus: Single
Variable,” “Greek and Roman Mythol-
ogy” and “Fundamentals of Pharmacol-
ogy.” The classes were taught by Penn
professors and offered in partnership

with Coursera, a California-based on—_

line education company and a pioneer
in MOOCS. ‘ '
The study, conducted by the newly
created Alliance for Higher Education
and Democracy at Penn, delved into
when users enter and leave courses
and when and how they participate.
The courses varied in use of quizzes
and homework and instruction time.

Completion rates wereslightly higher
in courses with smaller workloads.
Most courses focused on personal
enrichment or occupational skills, such
as “Cardiac Arrest, Resuscitation Sci-
ence and Hypothermia.”
Perna said she was a bit surprised

‘ by the results.

“Four percent is low. I didn’t expect
it to bequite this low,” she said.

But Ed Rock, who heads Penn’s
MOOC initiative, called the ﬁndings
“entirely unsurprising and not at all
troubling. Four or ﬁve percent of 1.6
million».(current users) is still.80,000
people, and 80,000 people isa huge
number to educate.” . .

Rock, senior adviser to the president
and provost and director of open course
initiatives, al_so said those who do not
complete have gotten something from

the experience.

The majority of MOOC users are
doing it for leisure learning or job de-
velopment, so it’s not surprising that
few ﬁnish, said Cathy Sandeen, vice
president for education attainment and
innovation at the American Council on
Education.

“There is a place for MOOCs in terms

of degree attainment, but it’s probably —

a smaller component overall than we
might have originally thought,” she

‘said.

Rock acknowledged that educa-
tors have a way to go in learning how,
best to ﬁt MOOCs into the educational
mission. Penn has partnered with 10
high schools locally and nationally
whose teachers are using Penn’s cal-
culus course to supplement classroom
learning.

“Our hope is our material will be of
value. We won’t know that unles's,[high
school teachers] try it out and tell us,”
he said. “We believe these materials
have the potential to revolutionize edu-
cation, but they’re only going to work
in a partnership.” _

Perna, whose team includes re-
searchers Alan Ruby, Robert Boruch,
Nicole Wang, Janie Scull, Chad Evans
and Seher Ahmad, agreed that MOOCs

could beneﬁt society. She cited the .

case of a neighbor who is taking a
management MOOC with co-workers
who meet each week to discuss what
they’ve learned. -

“I think there is something there,”
she said,»“but we needlto understand
better what that contribution is. Penn

‘is clearly committed to exploring these

issues.” I

PALLIGRAPI-iii  

University needs to learn lesson in ﬁscal responsibility

" Rohith Palli
Columnist

College is expensive. Pitt, com-
pared to the average public
university, is particularly ex-
pensive. According to the Col-
lege Board, the average tuition
at public universities last year
was $8,655. So why does Pitt
charge almost double this,
$16,240?

One reason is almost cer-
tainly the stinginess of the
Pennsylvania state govern-
ment. Gov. Tom Corbett signed
into law'a budget that allocates
$136.3 million to Pitt. In the
2012-2013 school year, 72 per-
cent of students at Pitt were
from Pennsylvania, according
to the Pitt Fact Book produced
by Pitt’s Office of Institutional

Research.

If we assume the same num-
ber and breakdown of in-state
and out—of-state students for
this school year, there are just
more than 20,000 in-state
students at Pitt this year. That
means the state government
contributes approximately
$6,600 per in-state student
(if we are very generous in our
calculations). Though this is
above the national average re-
ported by CBS News of about
$5,900 per student, this comes
nowhere close to covering the
difference between in- and out-
-of-state tuition. Pitt receives

. more than $3,000 less state

support and tuition per in-state
student than it does per out-of-
state student. .

- Despite being greater than

the national average, Pennsyl-

A vania’s supportof Pitt seems
piddling in comparison. to _

the roughly $17,400 spent by
Michigan on the University of
Michigan-Ann Arbor, by the
same metrics. They- spend
$279.1 million on 27,979 un-
dergraduates, 57.4 percent of
whom are in-state students.
In this limited contrast,
state funding seems to free a
university to providehigh qual-
ity education with low tuition
levels for in-state students.
For those universities that lack
such state funding, they need
to ensure students that their
current spending is appropri-
ated to benefit the most stu-
dents. At Pitt, it doesn’t seem
like that’s the case.‘ I .
To combat these problems,

and to stay competitive with _
institutions such as the Uni—'
versity of Michigan, Pitt needs
to take a closer look at making
the most of the funding it does
get, regardlessof the amount.
It is important to efficiently
allocate funds for every insti-
tution. ' -
According to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette, the athletics sec-
torhoused four of Pitt’s top
five highest-paid employees.
This allocation of resources,

‘although it may seem outra-

geous, might not be a terrible
thing: According to businessof-
collegesports.com, our basket-
ball team earns the University
more than $7 million in prof-
its. With that money, we could
support hundreds of students
with full scholarships. Hence,

athletics seems to add to the
University’s culture without
detracting from academics.

Recently, the University
of Kentucky built new hon-
ors housing and physics and
chemistry teaching facilities
using money generated by ath-
letics. However, Pitt doesn’t
necessarily bring in the same
amount of revenue from sports
as Kentucky.

In a time of shrinking bud-
gets, Pitt should begin to cut
the opulence in -athletics and
redirect that money to fund
learning. I don’t mean the Uni-
versity should pay out fewer
athletic scholarships. Giving
motivated students who are
invested in sports the chance

to go to college and learn is great, but
maybe some sports teams could travel a
little less or we could not waste money
on new stairs for the Pete at random
times.

Another issue of questionable fund- I

ing pertains to recent renovations on
campus. For instance, Market Central
certainly didn’t require renovations this

December 5, 2018 | The Pitt News l wvvx/v.pittnevvs.com

past summer. It’s great students now
have a dessert bar, but the renovations
surely did not justify their cost.
Another example is the new book
center: Despite being an impressive and
remarkable new storefront, it certainly
did not justify a cost of more than $300
per undergraduate student for the hour
each year most students use that space.
What is most mind-boggling about
this tendency is that the University has
opened a new dorm and renovated all
of these spaces instead of providing

something more useful for its students.

As an example, Hillman Library, a com- V

mon study place for Pitt students, has
not been given the same thoughtful
consideration by the University.

For one, the library still lacks proper
lighting and space for students to learn
and study for exams. The Pitt libraries
have wisely ‘moved to 24/7 hours dur-
ing the work week, but because of poor
lighting, an unstable Internet connec-
tion and the fact that the floors often
ﬁll to capacity during exam periods due

to the serious lack of space, the current
efforts are not a sufficient solution.
Ultimately, there are key problems
on campus that can be solved by real-
locating our budget. A little less atten-
tion to less important spots on campus
may solve the problem, whereas a closer
consideration to renovating and im-
proving the most used and important
campus buildings may ‘actually enhance

‘Inside Llewyn Davis’ gives poignant glimpse

Stay?’ Wrz'ter

“Inside Liewyn Davis”
Directed by: ‘Ethan and Joei
. Coen
Starring: Oscar‘ Isaac, Carey

Muiiigan, John Goodman

Grade: A

“Everything you touch turns to sh*t!”
the icy words spat byjean (Carey Mul-
ligan, giving a beautifully bitter per-

formance) linger in the even icier New

York air. “You’re like King Midas’s idiot
brother.”

This witty, biting criticism is di-
rected at Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac)
having just been told he’s potentially
the father ofJean’s —— his close friend’s

’girlfriend’s —— unborn child. And it’s

an unfortunately accurate reflection
of the Coen Brothers’ titular character.
Nothing can possibly go right for him.

The hazy, smoke-filled barsgand
woolen~clad, bearded folk singers may
suggest a nostalgic reflection on the
Greenwich music scene of the 19605.

Yet the Coen Brothers inject their id-

-iosyncratic tragedy—laden humor and

humanity to provide a touching insight
into this often-mythicized era of Ameri-
can music. And it’s all through the eyes
of one of their most engaging characters
to date.

“Inside Llewyn Davis” paints a living
portrait of Davis. Through his inability
to maintain friendships, his attempts

to remain sincere to his craft and his‘

attempts to avoid becoming the dreaded
“careerist” musician, he all the while
tries to make ends meet. Though it
might be hubristic, it’s this integrity
and idealism that encourages the audi-
ence to continually root for him, even
though he manages to infuriate anyone

Davis, however, appears to sit com-
fortably in this role of deadbeat artistic
rogue, roaming from couch to couch.
He informs his disinterested nephew,
after an argument with his sister, that
“your uncle’s a bad man” without even
an ounce of regret.

The Coens succeed in capturing this

_week in the life of Davis with an intimate

stillness, lingering on Davis’ failures
and documenting the stagnant nature
of his existence. Nothing is achieved.
There are no dramatic realizations or
character arcs. Yet it’s his failures that
make him so believable and empathetic.

“The Hunger Games: Catching

Fire”

Directed By: Francis Lawrence’

Starring: Jennifer Lawrence,
Josh Hutcherson, Woody

Grade: A

The odds were deﬁnitely in favor of “The
Hunger Games: Catching Fire,” and the

’ ﬁlm proves to be exactly what was ex-

pected as the second installment of the
best-selling franchise.

In this ﬁlm, Katniss Everdeen (Jen-

Hutcherson) are still recovering a year
after their ﬁght to the death in the last
annual Hunger Games. As the members
of the Capitol watch their every move,
anything they say or do could result in
rebellion. Chaos ensues in the twelve dis-
tricts of Panem, and when President Snow
tells Katniss to either quell the districts
on their “Victory Tour” or face the conse-

can to save her friends and family. But a

John Dellaverson didn’t write or produce
“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,” the
season’s biggest blockbuster. But he did
help build the house that’s making mil-
lions of dollars because of it.

Dellaverson, a Pitt grad and former
executive vice president of Lionsgate
Entertainment, worked for a Canadian
ﬁlm company, Cinegate, that eventually
merged into Lionsgate. While at Lions-
gate, Dellaverson also served as an execu-
tive producer on ﬁlms, including “Diary of
a Mad Black Woman.” Currently, he serves
as vice chairman of Film Finances Inc., a
company that ensures the completion of
many of the world’s independent ﬁlms.
Dellaverson is just one of the seemingly
endless examples of Pitt alumni working
in the ﬁlm industry.

Although Pitt does not have a formal
ﬁlm school, many students have utilized
plentiful opportunities from the Univer-
sity and the city. One of the strongest
bridges between Pittsburgh and" H01-
lywood is the Steeltown Entertainment

‘Project.

Steeltownis a nonproﬁt headed by Pitt
professor and Hollywood screenwriter
Carl Kurlander (“St. Elmo’s Fire,” “Saved
By The Bell”). Its objective is not only to
springboard local talent into Hollywood,
but also to lure the business to Pittsburgh.

“Steeltown’s real mission is to build
an industry here.” Kurlander said. “With
all the creative disruption in Hollywood

Raymond Cho is a psychologist at Pitt, a medi-
cal director and afather——but onthis Monday
night in November, he’s also a singer-song-
writer perforrningfor the ﬁrst time, stepping
up to the stage at Club Cafe.

Club Cafe is a 21'-and—older music venue in
the South Side known for its excellent food,
posh ambience and intimate performances
by critically-acclaimed musicians. But on
Monday nights, at their increasingly popu-
lar Open Stage event, anyone can perform.
Instruments, backing band and talent are
all optional. The only thing mandatory is the
courage to get in front ofa crowd and perform.

Cho, 44, has played keyboard for six years.
His original compositions, at their best mo-
ments, were reminiscent of the exhilarating
piano style of classical pianist Jon S_chmidt,
interspersed with Cho’s still—developing vo-

cal style.

“It went okay, a little rough in patches,”
Cho said alterhisperformance. He saidthathe

set the bar low for himself. As long as he didn’t ‘

walk off the stage in shame, he was happy.
For college students, open mic is perhaps
associated with off-key singers, turgid poets
and cringe-worthy comedians, and sure, those
are all possible at Club Cafe. But in addition to
being a chance for newcomers such as Cho to

with aprofessional sound system, this weekly
event also brings insome of the best perform-
ers in Pittsburgh, where they collaborate, jam
and try out new songs.

“It’s so nice to come to a venue like this
where you play a song you wrote and people
aren’t just tuning you out,” said singer—song-
writerjessica Saenz to the crowd, before belt-
ing out two sultry, jazzy originals. Saenz, 21,
is a self—described broke bar musician who
began playing piano at 12 and who plays by
ear. A former contestant on “The X Factor”
who made it to the second round of auditions,
she exuded style and conﬁdence on stage, and
the cheering crowd made it clear that they
weren’t clapping just to be polite.

Joel Lindsey, aprofessional musician from
East London, England, said that the blunt
honesty of Pittsburghers is one of the things
he loves about Club Cafe’s Open Stage night.

. “Nobodywill shush the crowd here,” Lind-
sey said. “Controlling the crowd is the musi-
cian’s responsibility. Inexperienced musicians
learn their lesson here.”

Lindsey, 32, settled in Pittsburgh after mar-
rying a fellow musician who is from the city,

and he is now the frontman for the band Bou— .

LLEWYN DAVIS

Great restraint is demonstrated so as

not to patronize the audience by allow— '

ing the narrative to tell you how to judge
their central protagonist with grand and
predictable revelations. But then again,
these are the brothers who brought the

world such unique anti—heroes as The '

Dude in “The Big Lebowski” and H.I.

McDunnough in the woefully underap-

preciated ﬁlm “Raising Arizona-”.
New/York is similarly photographed

in a somewhat less-than romantic light

— there are no sweeping Woody Al-
len-esque love—letter shots of the Big
Apple. Instead, the audience is placed at
ground level, among the.dirt and winter
slush, to bear the brunt of this unfor-
giving environment alongside Davis.
The camera navigates through cramped
Greenwich apartments, framing awk-
ward interactions between Llewyn
and the various characters he annoys.
That said, there is still unquestionable
beauty in the grimy, snow-speckled al-

leyways and the smoke-ﬁlled folk clubs
into which we are led. . . ”

Like “O Brother, Where Art'Thou?,”
it’s easy tohview “Inside Llewyn Davis”
as much as an ode to a musical epoch
as an unorthodox odyssey. All but one
of the musical inclusions are performed
live by the various actors, and the no-
table absence of music otherwise sup-
plies greater gravitas to the few perfor-
mances the audience is gifted. This is
where the ﬁlm, and also Oscar Isaac as
Davis, shine the brightest. The rendi-
tions given by Isaac provide the most
delicate and touching moments of the
ﬁlm, granting the audience (both on
screen and in the movie theatres) a
glimpse of his vulnerability, his art-
istry and also the craft for which he has
sacriﬁced so much. '

The ﬁlm ends where it began, em-
phasizing the circular monotony of
Davis’ situation as a committed singer-
songwriter in ’60s New York. A brief
glimpse of this musician, suspiciously
sounding and looking like a young Bob
Dylan, might suggest that perhaps times
are a—changin’. E

l With the holidayslapproaching, stu-

dents’ stress levels skyrocket with the
final push of papers, exams, presen-

that healthy eating, sleeping well and
exercising consistently can lower stress
levels and help students maintain their

But practicing what is preached is not
always easy.

Eating well is one ofthe best ways to

maintain a healthy lifestyle. What you‘

put into your body dictates what comes
out. Levels ofproductivity, energy and

that healthy eating translates to high

“What you’re learning in college is es-

When you plan ahead, it’s not difficult to
eat well on a tight budget,” Ardine said.

Ardine outlined quick and easy ways

and opened the night with a stunning original
song, backed by his thumb-slap and ﬁnger-
style acoustic guitar work.

According to Lindsey, Club Cafe is not only
the best open mic venue in Pittsburgh, it’s
also one of the best in the country. He con-
trasted Pittsburgh’s eclectic music scene with
Nashville’s scene, which is a country scene by

default, or to NewYork City, where performers ’

are competing to be the ultimate hipster, using
weird vocal effects and avoiding straightfor-
ward songwriting.

“Pittsburgh has no musical identity,” said
Lindsey, “and that is a good thing.”

For local musician David Dickinson, Club
Cafehas not only beenaplace to connectwith
the Pittsburgh music scene, but it is also.a good
place to get back into playing guitar after cut-
ting off a ﬁnger with a table saw.

“It completely changed my playing style,”
said Dickinson, 34, a contractor by trade and
a father of three. Since the accident two and a
half years ago, Dickinson also picked up the
bass to play for Jeremy Caywood, another

artist he met at Club Cafe. .

“Open mic nights are good for two things,”
said Dickinson, “gettingbetter and network-
ing with other musicians.”

Although the crowd mostly consisted of
musicians and their friends and families, some
people were there justto enjoyan evening out
in South Side. Mohini Dasari andJoyce Kimare

at Club Cafe after taking a big test.

“There’s a lot of hidden gems here,” said
Kim, who said itwas her ﬁrst time at Club Cafe.

Jessie and Kiki Young, the core members

They’re sisters. I

“We’ve been singing together since we
could talk,” saidjessie, 29, and this showed in
their performance. While suumming rhythms
on guitar, Jessie laced her laser-precise har-
monies over her sister Kiki s blues-tinged lead
vocals. Their performance also got a guest
appearance from Dickinson, whose lead
guitar lines popped and twisted overJessie’s
rhythms.

“This is the best of the best here,” Kiki,
28,_said, after their performance. “If you’re
a musician in Pittsburgh, you have tofcome

machine midday. You’ll be eliminating
a lot of trans fat from your diet and

she said.

With Pitt’s flexible meal plan, many
students make a beeline for the con-
venient fries-and-burger bar that wel-
comes them into Market Central, or
they grab a quick pastry on their way
out of Towers or into the Cathedral. If
students venture down Forbes Avenue
to the many restaurants that ‘accept
Pitt’s Panther Funds, they’ll see the

nutritional values often posted next to
menu items. 1

The novelty of Red Oak is not just
that the restaurant caters to patrons

tively low prices.

“We try to do higher volumes and
lower margins. We’re limited in service

HOLLYWOOD

such as “The Dark Knight Rises,” “Jack
Reacher” and “Foxcatcher” have been
drawn to the city for its generous tax in-
centives.

Despite Pitt’s lack of a formal ﬁlm school, _

Kurlander notes that many of the students
Steeltown has exported to Hollywood ad-
justed smoothly to the industry.

“The business there is much more about
doing the job, showing up, being a self-start-
er  a lot of things that I think Pitt kids
particularly excel in,” Kurlander said.

One of his own former students, John
Paul Horstmann, took full advantageof all
the University’s opportunities — and even
managed to create a few of his own.

Horstmann founded The Creation Sta-
tion, which is currently known as UPTV,
and gained invaluable experience editing
shortﬁlms to be broadcast for students. He
recalls the overwhelming freedom granted
to the group by the University.

“They were incredibly supportive of us
putting this together our way, and didn’t

step in to regulate what we could or couldn’t
do,” he said.

From editing videos at Pitt, Horstmann
was given a_platform of experience to -pre-
pare him for an internship with American
Cinema Editors. He has since edited sev-

. eral major studio ﬁlms, including “Killing

Them Softly” and “The Assassination of
Jesse James,” and he doesn’t rule out the
possibility of returning to Pittsburgh for
future projects.

“Pittsburgh has some of the most in-
credible locations in the country and is very
enthusiastic about getting productions to
shoot there through Steeltown, and their
tax incentives,” he said. i .

But not all Pitt alumni in the ﬁlm industry
embrace the Hollywood lifestyle.

Anne Estonilo, co —founder of New York—
based production company mouseROAR,
attests to the notion that Hollywood is a
“one—industry town,” and she is proud of the
professional diversity that New York offers.

“I’m much more interested in any per-
sonalities that are outside of the ﬁlm in-
dustry,” Estonilo said. “It broadens your
perspective.” _ . ,

With mouseROAR, Estonilo said she aims

’ A V V . counts or Arwoon 3. auras I 412.681.5656  I »

A MAD-MBX.COM ’ '

to create projects with purpose —-‘those that
extend beyond the medium of ﬁlm.

“Part of the reason I’m in New York, is
I’m more interested in treating a ﬁlm as sort
of a start-up venture,” she said.

From its early emphasis on advertising
and marketing, mouseROAR has come to
embrace the mantra of “proﬁt with pur-
pose.” Whether it is through documentary,
scripted ﬁlms or advertis_ing,‘mouseROAR

_ strives to reach for the larger message. Two

of Estonilo’s upcoming projects, an adapta-
tion of Henry “Box” Brown’s escape from
slavery and “Future Tense,” a documentary
exploring the stunning achievement and
pitfalls of technology, both point to a larger
thematic purpose.

Though Estonilo geographically distanc-
es herself from most other Pitt ﬁlm success
stories, she acknowledges Hollywood’s ﬁ-
nancial value in advancing the message of

documentaries like “Future Tense.” But she ‘

also wants these ideas to operate outside of
the traditional forums of ﬁlm.

“We want it to become more than just a
ﬁlm that goes out there and does the festival
circuit,” Estolino said. “It’s a ﬁlm that is
presented to high schools and can start a

town hall conversation.”

Other alumni, while not directly produc-
ing ﬁlms, have headed out West to cover the
industry. Anthony Breznican, a senior movie
writer for Entertainment Weekly, cites his
time at Pitt as an excellent foundation for
both his background in journalism and his
affinity for creativity.

“Even though Pitt isn’t known as a ﬁlm _

school, like USC or NYU, it’s a place where
people go and have tremendous creativity,”
he said.

Breznican points to the community’s

’ numerous creative offerings -— from Sunday

Night Live play readings at the Beehive to
Friday Night Improv —— as being particu-
larly instrumental in his desire to be around
creative output. '

Living in Hollywood has given Breznican
the opportunity to interview everyone from
cinematic legends, such as Steven Spielberg,
to far younger stars, such as Daniel Rad-
cliffe. Covering ﬁlms and award shows has
probably allowed him to meet just as many
prominent personalities as any ﬁlmmaker.

“If ‘you like being around people who
are creative and funny and weird, there’s
no better job,” he said. I

double digits

Redshirt freshman center Bubbles An-
dersonwon the opening tip on Wednes-
day night with relative ease.

As much is expected from the 6-foot-
11-inch center. Nine seconds later, she
converted the first bucket of the game,
a layup at the rim that even Lamar Pat-
terson might envy.

A similar highlight occurred on mul-
tiple occasions Wednesday night, but

the rest of the contest did not go as '

planned for the point-thirsty Panthers,
as they fell to James Madison 71-61.

The Pitt (4-4) offense struggled
mightily in the first half, posting only
28 points.

The lack of execution on the offensive
end is becoming a dangerous trend for
this squad.

The team has now failed to score
more than 30 points in five ofthe eight
first halves it has played, forcing them-
selves to yet again attempt to come back
in the second half.

James Madison (6-2) senior guard
Kirby Burkholder, pegged as the Co-

ACC

and has one shot at a BCS bowl, which
would also be a first. The Blue Devils
don’t have a national title on the line,
but considering how bad Duke football
has been, winning an ACC title by heat-
ing the top-ranked team and going to a
BCS bowl was more far-fetched at the
beginning of the season than what FSU
accomplished.

Here’s this week’s ACC Breakdown:

Florida State '

The systematic drubbing of struggling
in-statelrival Florida had to feel good for
the Seminoles. FSU has always been the
little brother in the state but cemented
a 4-8 season for the Gators and wrapped
up its own perfect season. The Seminoles’
ﬁnal test lies in the ACC Championship
game at Bank of America Stadium in
Charlotte, N.C., against Duke.

Duke '

Like FSU, Duke also took care of an
in-state rival. The Blue Devils, in less im-

pressive fashion, defeated rival North .

Carolina 27-25 after a 27-yard ﬁeld goal
with just more than two minutes remain-
ing put them ahead for good.

Clemson

Clemson didn’t fare as well in its
matchup with an in-state rival. The Tigers
turned the ball over six times in their 31-
17 loss to No. 10 South Carolina. Although
its goal of a BCSTbowl is looking slim,.
Clemson will play in a high—proﬁle bowl
and can send out stars Tajh Boyd and
‘Sammy Watkins on a high note.

— Miami . ’

After three straight losses, the Hur-
ricanes’ offense appears to have hit its
stride again, although against inferior
competition, by winning its last two
games while scoring 86 combined points.
Miami defeated Pitt 41-31 in a game that
was never close.

Virginia Tech _

. For the 1oth—straight time, Virginia
Tech defeated its in-state rival, Virginia.
Although it wasn’t pretty, the Hokies took
down their rival 16-6 while turning the
ball over_ twice and only converting 4 of
14 third-down attempts.

UNC

Quarterback Marquise Williams’ pass
was intercepted after advancing his team
into Duke territory while down two points
late in the game. If the Tar Heels could’ve
executed the drive and got at least a ﬁeld
goal, they would’ve ended Duke’s improb-
able run while capping off their own sev-
en-game winning streak. Considering it
was once 1-5, UNC should be happy to
have made it to 6-6 and bowl eligibility.

Georgia Tech

20-0 lead over rival Georgia before al-

a 6-2 James Madison run in the opening
minutes of the second half slowed any
hopes of a Pitt victory.

After a Frederique Potvin three?

point shot narrowed the JMU lead to
just six with 14:31 to go, Burkholder led
the Dukes on an 8-0 run that pushed the

The built—up frustration from Pitt’s
poor performance on Sunday versus
Buffalo coupled with the team’s perfor-

sideline, as ﬁrst—year head coach Suzie

discontent with both her players and

The Dukes’ pressure—packed defense
stood as a large barrier, as they pre-

up—ternpo system.

“Sometimes we get stagnant when
they take away our first or second op-
tion,” McConnell—Serio said. “In the
second half, we started standing around
and not creating opportunities. You are
too easy to defend if you are’ standing
ﬁve players-on the perimeter with no
cutting or’ screening. I think once we
got tired, that started to happen.”

Anderson put it plain and simple-
This team needs toplay with an edge
that it has been lacking for some time.

“We need to come out with more
fight and more intensity,” she said.

Pitt knew" coming in that it would
face a formidable opponent in James

Madison, as the Dukes had already tak¥ -

en down Virginia and UCLA by double-
digit margins earlier this season.

Junior guard Brianna Kiesel said the
matchup with a high-quality opponent
was one the Panthers talked about he-
forehand as a potential ego—booster if
they could pull out the winl

“We knew they were a very good
team, and it would have been a very
good win,” Kiesel said. “I thought we
did a lot of good things, we just have
to do better.”

Kiesel led _the Panthers with 15
points. .

The Panthers return to action Sat-
urday when they travel to Staten Is-
land, N.Y., to face nonconference foe
Wagner. Following the Wagner game,
the Panthers return home to play Old
Dominion on Dec. 15 before embarking
on a trip to Las Vegas for Duel in the
Desert, a three-game swing that will pit
them against DePaul, Louisiana-Monroe
and Washington over a three-day span.
