Oakland students pause to reflect  

by Kelsey Shea
C0/ztri/mti/z_q Editor

For Pitt students, Thursday’s
commemoration ceremony for the
three fallen Pittsburgh police officers
was impossible to miss. ,

The steps of the Petersen Events
Center were navy: blue with the
uniforms of hundreds of police
officers from across the country.
Cop cars from as far away as_Or—
egon and Toronto lined Forbes and
Fifth avenues, and a somber silence

permeated Pitt’s campus Thursday’

afternoon.

Students speckled the crowd of
hundreds that lined the streets of
upper campus showing their sup-
port for the fallen officers outside
the Petersen Events Center. '

\While some students dressed
for the occasion, wearing black
and holding American ﬂags, oth-
ers, laden with book bags, pulled
their headphones out, closed their
cell phones and stopped to watch
the event. _

Freshman Vince Pronesti stopped
on his way back to Sutherland Hall

, “It’s a really sad thing. I heard on
the news that a Pittsburgh police of-
ficer hasn’t been killed since 1995,”
said the Pittsburgh native;

Students from outside the Pitts-
burgh area were also movedby the
tragedy and came out to the to show
their support for the officers.

“This isn’t my city, but this is _

where I go to school  these are
the guys who protect us,” said fresh-
man Gail \X/oodward from Reading,
Pa. “It’s awesome that all these of-
ficers came here.”

For freshman Kimberly Goody,

‘the memorial was particularly emo-

tional.

“My father is actually a police
officer and he was shot in the line
of duty,” she said. “He didn’t die,
but this brings back those memories,
especially having been brought up in
that tight community.”

Though relations between the
student community in Oakland and
law enforcement can get rocky at
times, the students attending the me-
morial emphasized their respect and
appreciation for the police officers.

“As a college‘ student, I don’t

think a lot of students recognize
what law enforcement does and how
they put themselves at risk every
day to keep us safe,” said Pitt junior .
Doug Prah. _

On campus, buses stopped run-
ning, Fifth Avenue was closed, and
Forbes Avenue was restricted to one
lane.

For many students, the memo-
rial disrupted their usual Thursday
afternoon schedules.

“I was late to a couple classes
because of the bus schedules,” said
"freshman Svetlana Vodicka. “On
some level I don’t know if they

stuff, but it’s a pity that this hap-
pened.” _

But for most Pitt students, the
importance of the memorial out—
weighed the inconvenience. '

“At first I thought it was just traf-
fic,” said freshman Aderayo Sanusi.
“It’s a very striking way of making
a point to the community.” '

Goody agreed.

“I think it’s great that this is being
held on campus,” said Goody. “It’s
good for Pitt to be involved in the

Staﬂ Writer _

The three ofﬁcers who were killed’ on
Saturday did not receive warning that Rich-
ard Poplawski, of Stanton Heights, owned
weapons. - _ ,

Pitt police ofﬁcer Ron Bennett could
not provide further comment on the mis-

communication, as the investigation is still ‘
pending, but he explained that emergency .

calls to the Pitt police department operate
differently.

A call made to 911  put you  con— ,

tact with a call-taker, who then sends the
information electronically to a dispatcher
who will send police response.-

’ ‘ Inside the Pitt police station on 3412
Forbes Ave., however, there is a communica-
tions room where calls made directly to the

Pitt police line (412-624-2121) are ﬁelded. '

A call-taker records the information from
the caller and immediately contacts police
officers in the area by radio, said‘ Bennett.

_E.ssential1y, the Pitt police’s_ method of
communication has cut out the middle-
man, where the communication issue in the
Poplawski shooting occured. V ,

1 Bennett would not say whether he felt
the Pitt police’s,methodiis better than the
one used by cityppolice. Robert Harvey, the

911‘communications manager, could not be
reached for comment.

Depending on where an incident occurs
on campus, area police will respond to the
scene. ' '

“The University is set up in sectors,’_’ said

Bennett. There are six beat officers on foot 1
who cover areas like the residence balls on

Forbes Avenue, the Hillman library block
and the buildings on Ruskin Avenue.
Upper Campus, speciﬁcally by Sutherland
Hall, is the only area without foot officers
and instead relies on patrol cars, he said.
Patrol cars are assigned different sections
of campus, said Bennett, and can be radioed
for backup if needed.
The University and the city also have
different laws for carrying weapons.
People who are 21 and have a proper

permit are allowed to carry a concealed gun

in Oakland, said Bennett. A
However, once you step foot on Pitt
property, he said, “it becomes a sanction

_ against the University.

“No one except police are allowed to
carry weapons on campus,” he said.

When a student commits ‘a crime, either
on- or off—campus, the Pitt police turn them

over to Student Affairs to consider disciplin-

ary action, said Bennett.

Patty Mandia watched the proces-

same bureau where the three officers
worked.

Mandia left her job at UPMC Pres-

ﬁont of the Center for hours so she
could‘ get a good view of the proces-
sion. It left her speechless, she said.

“Ifs just very, very sad,” she said.

Mandia at UPMC, stood with her into

she said “You hope you never have to

Lansing police Sgt David Ellis felt

Oh. Weﬂ hello there. It appears

No, no, I insist. You_ go first. I’m

bestowing my selﬂess charity upon
someone else at that next set of
swinging’ doors down the hall.

' No, no, I appreciate the gesture,
but I insist. These terms are non-
negotiable. Door-holding has its
own set of conventions and norms
that we must adhere to unwaver-
ingly at riskof extensive scorn and

‘public ridicule.

For example, it is customary
to check behind you as you’re ap-
proaching a door so that you may

behind you. You’ll likely be thanked
for this selﬂess.a<_:t of grace and
altruism for this nonchalant, yet
somewhat genuine manner. You
nod because it sounds simple, but
I assureyou, it is not.

In some cases, perhaps you’re

aware that someone is coming but-

you’re unsure if it would be worth-

 

 

for

while to not only hold the door
for this stranger but also to hang
around for a while until he or she
catches up." In such cases, expect
the degree of verbal gratuity to be
variable in directproportion to the
length of time you sacrificed for the
sake of thissperson not having to
open his.or her own door.

For consistency purposes, you -

may want to consider establishing

a personal time limit for such situ—.

ations. Personally, if someone is
more than 3.5 seconds behind me,

- I will not hold the door, although

this value may vary depending on
whether or not the. person ap-
proaching is dealing with inclem-
ent weather or is particularly mean-
looking. ' _

No, no, I don’t mean to patron-
ize you. I’m' just trying to make a
point here, the crux of which is that
my proceeding through this opening
before you would irreparably tear
the social fabric so delicately woven
into our psyches since birth. That’s
all. And then there’s the whole be-
ing nice to others thing. ‘

So, please, I urge you: proceed.

Go first, if not for the sake of main--

taining the universe’s equilibrium,
for the sake of my left shoulder. It’s
getting pretty sore at this point.
' Really? You’llgo? Please do.
Well, you’re very welcome.
Thank you for your —— albeit some-
what delayedl— compliance. But
before we go our separate ways,
I have only a few remarks regard-

ing the manner in which you just i

thanked me. It underscores another
point I would like to. make with
respect to the ethical conventions
of‘ holding doors.‘

In situations where one pedes-
trian immediately follows another,

edly. A barely audible “anks” or
even “ks” will suffice in these most

mundane of circumstances. If both _

individuals are clearly in a hurry, you
rnay bypass thanking altogether, al-
though this is considered extremely
rude and off-putting. H l
But when the door holder has
expended a larger than average
amount of time and/ or energy,
the person being held for should

give a hearty “thanks” or even

, “thank you.” In highly unusual

circumstances, there’s even some
eye contact.

I’m  you another chance
here because you’re so painfully

inexperiencedat this. Since our ex- '
change falls into the above category,

I strongly advise you grace me with
_a much more clearly enunciated
“thank you.” A quick smile would
be nice, too. ‘
OK? I’m waiting. Nothing?
Listen lady, you can bypass stan-
dard thanking procedures under
only three conditions (none of
which you meet at the present):
You need not thank someone
for holding your door if you are
elderly.Being old excuses you from
pretty much anything. i , ' -
You need not thank your door

' holder_ if you are carrying some-

thing particularly heavy or cum-
bersome.

Finally, you are excused from '

door-holding gratuity if you are
eating something, as talking with
your mouth full also transgresses
polite conduct. ' _ I
You got all that? Good. Now

In the Carnegie Museum of
Art’s Hall of Sculpture, a vibrant
display of contemporary art sits
nestled among tall marble columns.
The placement of ancient Greek
statues towering over abstract
pastel portraits creates a stunning
juxtaposition.

Even more remarkable? None _

of the artists are more than 15
years old.

The museum’s latest exhibit
features work from 163 student
artists. All are students of The Art
Connection, Saturday art classes
for kids offered by the museum,
which celebrates its 80th anniver-
sary this year. The Art_ Connection
classes began in 1928. ,

“What really sets this program
apart,” said Ellen James, the mu-
seum’s assistant director of mar-
keting, “is that a few notables got
their ﬁrst training here. People like
Andy Warhol, Philip Pearlstein and
actor Jeff Goldblum all were stu-
dents here. ‘ . ~ '

“It’s something that’s been a
part of Pittsburgh for a long time.
It’s still teaching children how to
observe and study art. It’s a very
rich class. It’s also nice since art

"sometimes is the ﬁrst department

trying to cut back with a tight bud-

, get,” said James.

Art teachers ‘often suggest students
they believe would beneﬁt from

an extra art class per week, James T

explained. Studentsin grades ﬁve
through nine can enroll, and each
class is divided by grade.

“Each grade has its own theme
for the class. For example, ﬁfth
grade’s is ‘Art in Nature,’ and

‘ they’re looking at the natural world

and how it inspires all sorts of art
making,” she explained. “They’re

i doing painting, clay, drawing, deco-

rative art —— they even painted a

~ chair. It really runs the gamut and

gives the students further experi-
ence in all sorts of media.”

The exhibit displays the: wide .

  A Woman a Man Walks By

PJ Harvey and John Paris
Island Records

Rocks Like’: Pixies, Yeah Yeah
Yeahs 7

There is screaming, jamming and a ukulele
— all in the name of depressing, moving,
heart-touching music.

In a mere 38 minutes, P] Harvey and John
Parish take the listener through
exhilarating and emotional terri-
tory on their collaborative album,
A WomanA Man ll,/a/,éed By.

jumping straight into» the jams,
“Back Hearted Love” begins on a
dark, creepy and stalkerish note.
The words, “I think I saw you in
the shadows / I move in closer

beneath your windows / Who would suspect _

me of this rapture?” conjure the image of
a secret love that has completely enveloped
vocalist P] — short for Polly jean.

Please, listeners: Keep any latent desires the
song arouses conﬁned to the lyrics. It is still
illegal to stalk people.

From that hardcore opening, the duo pro-
gresses to a softer musical tone by simply sing-

ing andistrumming their instruments. Still, P]’s
voice can impressively take over the deep notes

- and soar on the high ones, so the lack of jam-

ming is only rninimally disappointing.

The second track hints at a dark storyof a
couple playing hide—and-seek while counting
down from 16 (hence the title “Sixteen, Fifteen,_
Fourteen”), only to cease with their laughter
in a muddy garden.

The high—pitched ballad “California” says
an ominous goodbye with the words, “No one
but me is walking / Under palms that give no
shade / I’m leaving you today.” It’s
so easy to substitute other names
for theemetaphors established by
the song, but the lyrics keep it su-
perﬁcially mysterious. _

Four songs in, and there’s no
sign of a cheerful ending. “Chair”
ends with the words, “Pieces of my
life / Are gone / Washed away’in
the water that took my son.” Oddly enough,
this is the song that reinttoduces the jamming
guitar in a switch from the melancholic acous-
tics, creating a tense ambience in its harmonic
chords.

Through “April,” P] croaks over the organ,
“I dreamed April / That I’m walking / That I’m

' watching / Your rain / It overcomes me.” The

album seems to suggest that all relationships are

doomed — at least the ones portrayed here. A

Taking a step toward the gruesome, the
track “A Woman a Man Walked By,/ The
Crow Knows Where All the Little Children
Go” takes the prize for longest song title,
but also showcases the abilityof thevocalist
to switch between unftlteredaharmonizing
and aggressive snarling. The lustful song
has contorted music in the background to
match the animal nature of lust — the word
“twitchy” is used, and it couldn’t be more
appropriate. V p 4 _

Leaking into the realm of current events,
“Soldier” proclaims, “It’s the year when
some poet said / We rrfust love or accept
the consequences / I want you to share
every pinprick of guilt / That I have felt,”
as Parish strumsi away on his ukulele. The
lyrics and P]’s passionate vocals will make
listeners feel the burning guilt the artists so

passionately try to convey in the song, but

only to a middling degree. ’ ' _

I Ironically shifting to a song called “Pas-
sionless, Pointless-,”» suddenly the passion
is gone, at least almost —— it’s a passionate

expression of a lack of passion in the i:e— _ '

lationship:“‘Passionless, Pointless / -Where
does the passion go? I’m asking  There’s

no kindness in your hands / ‘No reaching,

out for me tonight.” Confusing, yes, but the
artists poignantly express their feelings in a
relatable way. _

Finally, at the end, “Cracks In The Can-
vas’_’ proclaims, “Walking toward something
/ Waiting for something / I’m looking for
an answer / Me and a million others.”

Right on, P]. Thank you for that —-— be-
cause everyone will be dlamoring for answers
after this album.

Freshman L

by Kyle Craig 1
Staﬂ Writer

At Blair Academy, in Blairstown,‘

'‘ NJ, Dion Lewis’ former ‘classmates
are preparing for their May gradua-
tion. Butin the South Side, Lewis is
trying to become the Panthers’ start-
ing tailbackinthe fall. ‘

l Lewis, who graduated" from Blair

' in December, enrolled at Pitt for the
spring semester.  on campus
before the rest of Dave Warnistedfs
2009 recruiting class gave Lewis the
opportunity to adjust to the college

i lifestyle easily and work with the
team during spring camp. .

4 After a couple weeks of prac-

’ tices, Lewis has made a big impres-
sion on the coaching staff . and his
teammates At the moment,-the true
freshman appears to be the leading
candidate to replace LeSean McCoy
as Pitt’s feature back. ‘

“If we’re playing tomorrow, heis
in the mix for about 30 carries,” said
Wannstedt after the Panthers’ scrim-
mage on Saturday. , ' ..

Warmstedt and  back
coach David Walker noted that Lew-
is’ ability to gain an understanding
of the offense has been one of his
biggest assets. -

“Dion has come in here, and as
strange as this sounds,ihe probably

has as good a grasp of what we’re

i doing offensively as any of the backs,
and [he] has done it in a very short
amount of time,” said Wannstedt.

Unlike some freshmen, Lewis
hasn’t let more complex college
schemes hamper his progress.

“{Lewis] is agood learner,” said
Walker. “The playbook is not con-

 him. Sometimes  young,

guys, the playbook hamsuings them
and they play slow Right now, he’s
playing fast because he understands

‘what he’s seeing and understands C
what he’s lookihg at.”

Besides an understanding of the
Panther offense, Lewis also has the

Draft's ﬁrst round

Zellous, page 10

While Berenato knew Zellous
would be drafted, the anticipation
kept her anxiety levels high.

“Before they called her name, I
was a nervous wreck,” said Berenato.
“I kept  Shavonte if shetwas
OK. When they called her name, all I
said was, ‘Congrats, and I love you.”’

A January 2008 USA Today re-

port projected that WNBA rookies_

selected between theninth and 14th
picks in the Draft should expect to
receive $36,353 in their first years.
Rookie contracts in the league last
for three years, while teams retain
the option to add a fourth year. The
projected salaries for the second and
third seasons are $37,080 and $40,788,
respectively. ’

Zellous was one of four Big East .
players drafted in the first round. Mc—‘

Coughtry went first to the Atlanta
Dream, Connecticut guard Renee
Montgomery was selectedrfourth
by the Minnesota Lynx and Rutgers

‘ center Kia Vaughn was the eighth pick

for the New York liberty
Zellous, however, may have the
most to be excited about because she

joins the defending WNBA cham-

pions. »\
"joining the world champions
is unbelievable for Shavonte,” said
Berenato. “I can’t tell you how elated
I am.” '
In addition to helping Detroit win
another championship, Zellous will

be doing it alongside her idol Deanna _

Nolan, who averaged 15.8 points per
game for the Shock in 2008.

After being selected, Zellous told,
reporters she was overwhelmed at
the thought of playing alongside her
favorite" player.

Berenato said that Detroit will re-
ceive a great individual in Zellous.

“Mostly, I think I’ll miss her genu-

ine smile and  personality,” said. a - '
Berenato. “She is-really genuine, and,‘ .» .

“He has balance, he has acceleration, [and] he '
' has toughness.” ’

Lewis didn’t let the new environment and
the upgrade in talent—level intimidate him.
Conﬁdent in his abilities, he has tried to make
his statement on the ﬁeld.

V “I knew that it was  to be a tough road -

Lewis for being away from home. His biggest

mates. . .

“Just coming here and not really knowing

“But everybody welcomed me. It’s like a family.

here, so I felt really comfortable.” _ _ .

I With his feet ﬁrmly set on the ground,
Lewis can now concentrate on earning playing
time. Though Lewis has taken some repeti-
tions with Pitt’s starting squad, he’s still aware
of redshirt freshman Chris Burns’ and redshirt

I sophomore Shariff Harris’ desire to get on the

ﬁeld.
T “Everybody wants to look their best out
here,” said Lewis of the early competition. “It’s
a friendly competition for the job, but when
we’re on the ﬁeld it’s  business. If you want
to play you’ve got to work hard every day.”
For Walker, the competition is beneﬁcial for
the development of all three players. Consider-
ing how inexperienced the group is, the more

L competition generated in practice, the better.

“We don’t have so-called starters in the of-

, fensive backﬁeld,” said Walker. “We’re trying to
‘ﬁgure out what [everyone’s] role [is] going to‘
be So every day, guys have to come out here _
and compete to try, to earn the trust of the

coaches and the trust of their teammates”
Despite his early success, Lewis knows that
things could change at any point. That’s why
he’s focused on keeping “a humble approach; ’
and continuing to push himself. .
Things can change very quickly For in-

stance, you could go from one of _three incom-

ing freshman  backs to the likely No.
1'tai1back on the team in a matter of weeks
Or, you could leave a small private academy in
Newjersey early to attend classes at Pitt. '

Those are some pretty big changes, and so
far for Lewis, change has been good.”
