ANNUAL REPORT OP , -
EMPLOYMENT BUREAU

According to the report of «A.'R.
chairman of the Student
Employment Bureau, this bureau has
been of great service during the past
year in aiding students to work their
way through the University. Mr.
Hamilton's report is as ‘follows:

To the Alumni'Council:

As Chairman of the Committee on
Employment for Students 1 beg to
submit this, my ﬁrst annual report,
outlining the’ accomplishments of the
Student Employment Bureau for the
Academic year: of 1911-1912. As a re-
sultof our efforts, 239 undergraduates

were placed in employment of ‘tem-
porary or permanent nature, and
these students earned during this

time an aggregate of $15,991.’ The
members of your committee accept
this as a gratifying showing. ,It was
a new field of effort in which much
time and effort were .consumed in

‘building an organization to grapple
' with the problems involved. We laid

our groundwork on the information
gathered from more than sixty insti-
tutions of learning, which conduct
similar bureaus, and from which we
received in responseto our inquiries
complete information and valuable
suggestions.

Alumni, 1912 graduates and under
classmen of all departments were
given the opportunity of proﬁting by
the work of the bureau. At the out-
set, we sent a letter. explanatory of
our ‘rpose, to the managers of man-

ufacturing corporations, department

stores, retail shops, express com-
panies, etc., enclosing reference‘ card
and asking them .to communicate
their needs in our line as‘they arose.
We also sent out four Hiousand cards
to our registered Alumni, asking them
to indicate thereon any desire for a
change of employment. The student
body was advised of the formation
and purpose of the bureau, and each

' student was provided with a card on

which to indicate ‘his wants, giving a
brief history of his previous business
experience, if any.

To supplement this work among
the undergraduates, the Secretary of
the Bureau arranged to spend two

1 mornings each weekat stated hours

at the University to receive these
cards and‘giye each student an op-
portunity, if he desired, to go person-
ally a.little deeper into his particular
case. By this method_t=he secretary,
having the applicant’s previous his-

‘tory and being in a position to gather
from a personal interview an idea of

the student’s aptitude, could so close-
ly, adjust theapplicant to the position
that not once during the year did the
bureau receive a single complaint of
unsatisfactory services. ' ,

This successful ﬁtti_ng of the man
to the job was one of the most grati-
fying features connected with our
work and reﬂects great crfeditupon
the judgment of our secretary. It
obviated a situation which most Stu-
dent Employment Bureau managers
complain, of. Several of these bu-
,reaus -in. their reports complain of the
fastidiousnessi of students about ‘em-
ployment offered them and dissa‘tis-

faction arising on account of it. We

believe the‘ seat of this complaint lies
in the indiscriminate placing of stu-

’_,‘dents in rotation, asthe demand for

help develops, without rgeference to
the_‘ﬁtnes_s of the applicantjand hav-
ing been fcrewarned of this condition
elsewhere in the communications we
received on the subject, we evolved
our system of previous history and

personal interview.
In comparing the work of our bu-
reau with that ofisimilar organiza-
tions of large educational institu-
tions, we are satisﬁed flhat a good
start has been made during the past
year. Our organization is as com--
plete, we believe, as any maintained
by other institutions, with possibly
one or two exceptions, where several
men are employed exclusively in stu-
dent employment work. The amount
of money earned by our appointees
exceeds that of the majority of these
institutions. .
'.Our original canvass of all the
large colleges andiuniversitiesgtaken
at the time the employment bureau
movement was proposed, showed that
only a small percentage of themihave
bureaus as well organized as ours, so
that we are, not able to carry our
comparisons further than the brief
summary given above. We are fully
satisﬁed, however, that the University
of Pittsburgh is a step ahead’ of many
of them in this feature of the alumni
activities, and is therefore able to
hold out this as one of the many ad-
vantages to prospective students. In
this connection, allow us to observe
that. our experience during the. past
year in helping worthy students to
help themselves brought out in bold
relief the advantage of a city univer-
sity‘ to those who must employ their
hand and brain out of classroom
hours to pay for the education they

soiearnestly desire.

Respectfully submitted,
A. R. HAMILTON, ’94,
Chairman.

MUSICAL CLUBS BUSY.

 

The University of Pittsburgh
Musical Clubs combined with the
Glee and Mandolin Clubs of the
Pennsylvania College for VVomen last
Friday night in a joint concert that
proved highly entertaining to the

stitutions-who had gathered in the
Assembly Hall of the young ladies’
college. ,From the opening number,‘
“The Burple and the White,” by the
P. C. W. Glee and Mandolin clubs
combined, to. the ﬁnal strains of “Hail
to Pitt” by the Pitt combined clubs,
and the ﬁtting ﬁnale, “The Star
Spangled Banner” by the entire as-

. semblage, the interest did not lag for

an instant. . _
The P. C. W. Glee club’s num-

bers were. unusually well sung.
One number, especially, met with
popular approval; that being “Li

Tsin,” a Chinese chorus selection in
which Miss Ethel Williams featured as
soloist, with the glee club accompani-
ment. Another entertaining’ feature
was the Slnging of Mr"s.';Charles E.

Mayhew,-who ren_de.red- a trio of

many patrons and friends of both in- -

pretty numbers in pleasing style. The
 C. W. Mandolin club, although
composed of but ten youngladies,
gave a most excellent rendition of
the diﬂicult selection, Dvorak’s
“Humoresque.”

Following the concert, the P. C. VV.
young ladies entertained the Pitt
clubmen in their assembly hall, danc-
ing continuing until 11:30.

_ Friday night of this week the Uni-
versity clubs will journey to Hoboken
for their annual concert in the Work
House of Allegheny County located
in that borough. The boys will leave
the Union Station at 5:15 in the after-
noon. On the arrival at the Work
House the musicians will be shown
through the- institution, later being
guests of the superintendent and
chaplain at a dinner. Following the
dinner. the clubs will retire to the
chapel where they will present their
musical numbers for the approval of

the prisoners. -

Ne‘xt Friday night another out-of-
town concert will be held at New
Kensington. The following Friday
night a similar production will be
staged in the Carnegie "Library Hall
in Carnegie. Many other week-end
excursions will follow these concerts
in rapid succession until the draw-
ing near of the ﬁnal exalfninations.

Duquesne. .

The Davis Stock Company will
present the farce comedy, “Are You
a Mason,” at t'he Duquesne next
week. This is the ﬁrst production of
this play in Pittsburgh. It is similar
to the farcical favorite, “Charley’s

deans of the various schools of the
University, askingvthat these classes
be done away w'th. ltiwas the 'opin_
ion of the tudent Senate that this
matter ough ‘to, have immediate at-
tention, for the reason that there are

‘. a great many students that are put
A at a..disadvantage owing to the fact

that they have‘ a class at lunch time
two or more days a week.

For this action the Senate deserves
great, credit. It gives evidence that
the senators are on the alert and ever
willing to take up the cause -of the
student body, when the cause is a
worthy one. Surely ‘there is enough
time for classroom work in each day

. without asking the students to come
” to‘ class between the hours of 12:30
and 1:30. Irregular eating hours have

‘a bad effect on the constitution of any

. person, and the effect on college and
< university men is especially detri-

mental. |
,Another bad feature of_ the noon
hour class is -that the social life of

’ the students is interfered with to a

great extent. ‘-The one hour_ in the
day that students ought to be able
to meet together, the fraternity men

at their houses and the non-fraternity’

men at their eating clubs, is from
12:30 to 1:30. But with some classes
going on, at this time, this pleasant
social hour is often spoiled;

There.’ are no classes run at the as-

C sembly periods or at the weekly con-

vocation hour, *because they would in-
terfere with the meetings. Why’ have
classes at the noon hour and inter-
fere with the students’ social life?

BA GOOD REPORT.

The reportof the Student Employ-
ment bureau, which was recently
submitted to the’ Alumni council by
A, R. Hamilton, gives proof that the
bureau has been hard at work during
the last year._ Many of the‘ students
of the University have secured good
positions from the bureau, where they
earn enough moneydoutside of recita-
tion hours to paytheir way through
the Uiiiyersity. o The work of the

bureau ciomparesfavorably with or-

ganizations of a like -‘nature in other
instituti_on.=, and the plans for the
next year embrace an ‘even’ wider
range of activity than ha. een covered
in thepastx THE PIT WEEKLY
commends the bureau for What it has
accomplished so far and expresses
conﬁdence in theiability of the or-

ganization‘to do even greater things"

in the future.

To ABCLISH NOON
HOUR CLASSES

(Continued from Page 1)

lute importance of the noon hour to
the student is known to you all. II a
student I_nisseh ‘his noon hour entirely
or gets nothing to eat within two or
three hours of his habitual time, he is
not» fit for his work. Neither the stu-
dent _nor theinstructor can do jus-
ticepto noon hcﬂr classes or to after-
noon classes following.

A minor consideration is the detri-
ment to the fraternal organizations of
Pitt by keeping their men from lunch,
l.he.~one time each day they get to-
gether for fellowship and spirit.

Another point is that noon hour is
for the students, belongs to the stu-
dents. Last year the chapel hour was
refused a certain group of students
for the reason that it belonged to
the University for chapel.» Then cer-
tainly noon hour belongs to the stu-
dents and they should say ‘whether
they will have ‘classes during ' that
hour. The only solution is to sched-
ule no classes during noon hour. 'If
any class and instructor agree to hold
a class during "noon hour, it is all
right,=for it is the wish of everybody
concerned. But no classes should be
regularly scheduled at 4 noon -hour,
leaving the ti‘me open to all, faculty
and students. Trusting the deans
will be able'to remedy this and make
better arrangements for next term,

Yours very truly,
A. H. WETTACH,
‘ Chairman.

V This letter was considered at the
deans’ meeting. Each dean will try
to make any changes possible this
term. Prof. Mellor. chairman of the
schedule committee. makes every as-
surance that no noon hour classes _will
ever bescheduled in the future.

HONOR CODE
PRAISED BY DEAN

(Continued from Page 1)

during that time only one case oi
cheating had ever happened. and this
man was suspended. He says that
it develops a habit of honesty which
cannot be developed otherwise.
When asked whether he favored
adopting the honor system of exams
in all departments ‘of Pitt, I Mr.
Tthompson said it was one of the best
things the students could do. He said
\that practically every University had
adopted it up to the present time
and that it was now a question
whether Pitt should let other univer-
sities surpass it in honesty. Mr.
Thompson said that at first it might
be a good thing to adopt the sys-
tem only in the three upper classes at

. First, in order to’ see how it works out.

Q

COMMITTEE WILL
" P DISCUSS BASEBALL

-.

 

Thebaseball question will probably —

be discussed at the next meeeting of
the Athletic Committee, as the time
is approaching for settling t'he coach-
ing and other impor_tant questions.
The schedule is nearing completion
and Manager Grove states that it will
be a good one, although he is having

considerable trouble arranging games

with some of the small local colleges.

The baseball team did not have a’

successful season last year and the
cause can be traced to three leading
factors: First, the coaching system;
second, the lack of suitable practice
grounds; third, the fact that baseball
was newly organized‘ at. the Univer-

. sity.

The coachjingisystem receives most.
of the blame for the poor showing the

team made and',,while it probably was ’

a deciding factor, the other condi-
tions certainly were important disad-
vantages. Many of the players and

students think that Coach McCreer_v A

did not make the best of his oppor-
tunities, ppor. as they were, while
many others are inclined to blame
the players for the large number‘ of
defeats. V -_

It has been persistently, rumored
that the committee has received the
applications’ of several major leagie
players {who want the job of coach-
ing the ’Varsity ball team this ‘spring,
but the rumor has not been veriﬁed
and nothing will be done till -the next
meeting early in, February. , , 0

CUP WILL BE DoNA'rED

 

Word was received recently by the

track manager that a splendid trop'hy
cup will bedonated by a prominent
local man to thewinner of two of
the next three’ dual track meets be-
tween Pitt and W. & J. The donor
does not wish his name published, b-ut
the report is ‘correct and the college
that wins the trophy will be fortunate
as the cup is a beauty and cost a large
sum of money. ,_

The dualiymeets between Pitt and
Wash.‘-‘Jeff. are becoming of greater
importance each year as the two in-
stitutions are great rivals and _ar'e of
nearly equal strength in athletics. Pitt
won, last year’s-meet with plenty tb
spare,‘ but W. & J.'has_ some new
track “stars this season and hopes to
get revenge for past defeats admin-
istered by the Gold and Blue. No
arranfgements have been made for
next spring, but- the managers ex-

pect to come to terms shortly for a

meet in "Washington. '.

_ The cheer leaders were sadly
I'l’IlSS€‘1.t the last two games, but they

will probably turn'out_ to such an im- ‘
portant contest as-the i State game. ,

The cheering was a feature of the
Penn game last month, butihas not
been in evidence since.

favor of the visitors. Pitt then started
a rally and" the Juniatavplfayers made

is this sort of playing that makes any

on the work which they have been
doing along this line. Only the most
prominent universities of the eastare
members of the association, in which
there are some of the most noted

Juniata took the lead at the begin-
ning of the game when Capt. Bigler
tossed a couple of foul goals in the
basket and held it through the entire
ﬁrst half. Pitt did not display good
form and several times baskets were
missed that looked easy. In the mean-
time Bigler of the visitorswas scor-
ing many foul goals which placed his
team ﬁve points in the lead several
times. He put up one of~ the best
garges ever seen on the local floor, but
a severe fall late in the ﬁrst half
slowed ‘him up perceptibly.

Baker was the individual star of the
game, gettingll ﬁeld’ coals, several
of which were the most difﬁcult kind
of shots. He saved the game for Pitt
by his stellar performance. Frishman
also played a good game but‘fouled
repeatedly,’ which gave_Bigler many
chances to -score. Reese, who was

substituted for Ochsenhirt in the last ,

half, showed to good advantage. His
height makes him a valuable man for

center and he will probably alternate
with Ochsenhirt in the remainder of
the games. . *

NEW CONFERENCE FORMED

 

» It was recentlywlearned that a new
intercollegiate conference had been
formed by several colleges in the east-
ern part of this State and New York.
The ﬁrst meeting was held in Phila-
delphia and the colleges represented
were Lafayette, Lehigh, Swarthmore,
Haverford, Rutgers, New York Uni-
versity, Dickinson, Stevens Institute
and Muhlenburg. Paul F. Landis of
Lafayette was elected president and
Prof. W. H. Rees of Muhlenburg, sec-

retary. .The name of the new asso_- .

ciation is the Middle States Inter-

collegiate Athletic Conference, and it i

should do much to boom track ath-
letics in this section..
‘Since its organization Penn State,

F. Sz‘ M. and Ursinus have applied" for '

admittance and it is probable that
Pittsburgh will fall into line shortly.
The ﬁrst meet will be held at Easton,

SMOKE .. INVESTIGATORS
ARE HARD AT WORK

“That Pittsburgh maybe a cleaner,
more healthful ‘and more beautiful
city him which to live as well as in
which to work,” is the warcry of the
twenty-ﬁve men who are on the staff
of the Smoke Investigation of the In-
dustrial Research Department.

These twenty—ﬁve under the direc-
tion of Dr. R. C. Benner are engaged
in making the most thorough inves-
tigation of the “Smoke Nuisance”
ever attempted. No phase of this
many sided problem has been ne-
glected. As a basis for the whole in-
vestigation a survey is being made of
all the plants in the city which burn
bituminous coal. The conditions un-
der which the coal is burned in each

0 of these plants are being recorded

and when tabulated will form the
basis of general recommendations of
the means of burning bituminous coal
without dense smoke.

A study of the soot—fall in the vari-
ous sections of the city is being
made. Six physicians are investigat-
ing the relation of smoke and disease.
Five of Pittsburgh’s best architects
are going into the subject of smoke
and architecture.. Dr. Wallin, who
holds the chair of clinical psychology
in the School of Education, is en-
gaged in writing a paper ’ on the
“Psychological Effects" of Smoke,” a
subject upon which practically noth-
ing has ever been done. The effect
of smoke on the weather and plant
life is also being investigated. The
losses imposed upon Pittsburgers in
Various ways is being tabulated by the
economist of the staff Mr. Joseph
Beck is looking into the legal side of
the problem.

While these men are‘ gathering
their facts an effort is being made
through the newspapers, bulletins and
lectures to acquaint the people of
Pittsburgh ‘with the importance of the
problem and to arouse their interest
so that the recommendations of the
ﬁnal report of the investigation will
be put into force. A

The smoke nuisance ‘is undoubtedly
the most important problem before
the City of Pittsburgh. Dr.‘ Holds-

worth in the Euconomiic Survey wrote:
“The smoke nuisance is here’ set
down frankly and unreservedly as the
greatest hindrance to Pittsburgh’s
econdmic progress. It is the one
single problem imperatively demand-
ing solution if this city is to take and
maintain its proper rank in the indus-
trial world.” He could have added
the words of the Cleveland Chamber
of Commerce—“The smoke nuisance
is the greatest hindrance to the high-
est development of civic beauty and
refinement."

As the smoke investigation is pure-
ly, a University undertaking, it is ex-
pected that the alumni, students and
facult-ycwill show their interest by
spreading the news of‘ the purpose
and aim of the ' vestigation that it
may come to 13 “that Pittsburgh
may be a cleaner, more healthful and

more beautiful city in which to live.

as well as in which to work.”

POLICEWOMAN
ADDRESSES STUDENTS

Mrs. Alice Stebbins‘ Wells, one of
the new “policewomen” of Los An-
geles, Cal., gave an address to the
students of the University under the
auspices of the First ..Baptist Church
last Sunday night. She unveiled a
few’ secrets on the social questions
now commanding attentio. A few
quotations from her speech are:

“We must ﬁrst learn of evils be-
fore we can attempt to right them.”

“Women must solve the complexity‘

of crime among women and chil-
dren.” S -
“The policeman is a bigger man
than We think ‘and deserves more
credit.”
“Cities were never made for chil-
dren.” ‘ -

“Tlhe average parent is criminally

careless of the welfare of the child.
and criminals are the result.” .
