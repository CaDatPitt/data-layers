Homecoming
” Sales Over

Last Year’s

Homecoming was termed “quite
successful” by Homecoming
Chairman Jimmy Meyerson.
“More people went this year than
,in the last two years,” Meyerson
said. “We sold over 500 tickets,
, which I think is almost 200 more
than last year.”
Meyerson added: “We operated
33-_.  on our budget. We might even
have made some money.” Final
ﬁgures are not yet available.
The general reaction to the
Four Saints who entertained at
the Holiday House Friday eve-
-ning was very favorable, accord-
ing to Meyerson. The consensus
seemed to be disappointment

with Lisa Kirk, the other enter- _

tainer.

pa Kappa Gamma sorority, was
crowned Homecoming Queen at
the Pitt-Notre Dame game ‘Sat-

 urday. Miss Walker is a sopho-

Must Try for Change

Dr. Perkins of Cornell Demands

Powerful, Initiating Univ. Leader

By FRED N. FRANK

“With the faculty in orbit, students out looking
for their lost identity and administrators out
setting off dynamite. under foundations vaults,”
Dr. James Perkins, president of Cornell University,
asked “Who is in charge?”

Speaking at Princeton University, last week,
Dr. Perkins described the ideal university presi-
dent who would take change. He would not be
a mediator between conﬂicting forces, but an
“agent both for stability and change . . . who must
not fear poweror be afraid to exercise it because
he must know that power cannot be the direct
concern of either student or teacher.

“The despairing trustee and administrator have
frequently shared the longing of the bewildered.
student and critic for a return to some academic
Walden,” Dr. Perkins stated, “University integrity
is involved not with preserving things as they
are, but rather with the ways in which they are
changed.” P

Dr. Perkins felt that the burden of leadership
in the University would always be with its presi-
dent. The university president must look for a
few outstanding professors who are not only ex-

perts in their fields, but also understand the op-

erations of a general problem of a multiuniversi-
ty. Also he should try to establish a rapport with
those student leaders who exhibit ‘an ability to
administer.

Above all, Dr. Perkins thought the president
must realize that “someone must be concerned
with the institution as‘a‘l whole, the activities it
supports, the public face it presents, and the pri-
vate concerns with which it is occupied. This job
(the president’s) cannot be divided among dis-
parate elements of the university.”

,Warning what the ‘future may hold, Dr. Perk-
ins stated “those who want academic direction to
remain in academic handshave no choice but to
learn how to balance their desires for “indepen-
the necessity ' for close .univer‘s,ity,colla-
n . , .

direct intervention ‘in university affairs by gov-
ernment agencies. And none of us look comfort-
ably on that prospect.”

Dr. Perkins also predicted that if the univer-
sity president would‘ assume a role of strong lead-’

ership, certain changes would inevitably occur in-

the make-up of the university. “The student is
a» student. He is at the university to learn-—,not
to manage: to reﬂect--not to decide; to observe-—
not to coerce.’_’ ‘ 1

First the nature of the student body itself
would change. The students “who need the sense
of security that comes from being a member of a
smaller tighter community should ,not come to
the university.” He felt, however, the university
should work for alternatives for this type of stu-
dent such as a state supported system of junior
and four year colleges. ‘

The university student, according to Dr. Perk-
ins, would be extremely mature’ and not in need‘
of security within his educational community. His
liberal education would no longer be a group of
general courses which he would have to pick up
in the ﬁrst two years of his university career.
Rather his courses would “run on a track parallel
with professional work.”

He felt this would result in a great reduction
of the number of students attending universities
at the undergraduate level and ‘this would fac-
litate “the re-introduction of the undergraduate
to the research professor.”

Dr. Perkins saw the faculty as having as much
time as possible to be free to do research and
teach. Rather than being involved‘ in a lot-of
administrative duties, he would prefer them to
have time to be with their students and the other
members of the university community. But any
of; campus activity that a faculty member is in-

volved in must in some way be connected with’

his role as a teacher. /“Otherwise the professor is

‘just in business or moonlighting, and his students
are being _.shortchanged;’_’ ‘

explained Dr. Pérkins_._q

‘DUKE’ Editors 
Resign From Staff 

Four editorial board members of the Duquesne Uni-
versity student newspaper, The Duke, resigned as a result
‘of “personal aggravation, criticism, mental and emotional
strain, among other reasons.” Lawrence Walsh was appoint-_

'T\he students: Linda Michalowicz, editor-in-chief ; Elliot;

ministrative beats as they should.”

Dr. Kenneth Duffy, coordinator
of special activities, said, “I am
sorry that the student’ editors
resigned. I believe that with less
emotionality, the issue could
have been solved.” "

According to an editorial in
The Duke of Oct. 27, the resigna-
tions “were made after careful
consideration and were not the
hasty decision of an immature or
irresponsible nature.” The stu-
dents “charged that The Duke
operation had become too de-
manding and stated the faculty
editorial adviser had expected
too much of them as staff mem-
bers. Declaring they could ,noT_,
longer work under such a, sit-,1‘.
uation, they resigned.”

This University needs a leader. It has been three months since Chan-
cellor Edward Litchﬁeld resigned. It has been three months of insecurity,
instability, and indecisiveness.

Acting Chancellor Dr. Stanton Crawford has been here since 1920.
He has contributed many years of loyal service and we respect him for
that. He was obviously chosen to preserve the status. quo while the Uni-

versity recooperates from its ﬁnancial dilemmas.

Unfortunately, Dr. -Crawford’s altruism does not make him the type

of leader this University desperately needs. He is elderly, undynamic,
and unable to participate actively in guiding the future course of the Uni-

versity.

ministrative functionaries.

What this University needs is a dynamic, forceful Chancellor who
can guide and-initiate change. He must be as Cornell President James
Perkins states an “agent both for stability and change . . . who must not
fear power or be afraid to exercise it because he must know that power

Crawford now serves as mainly a mediator between conflicting forces,
all too numerous for him to, reconcile. A With Crawford as its figurehead, the
University operates on the drive _of individual department heads and ad-

cannot be the direct concern of either student or teacher.”

He must not identify University integrity with “preserving things as
they are, but rather with the ways in which they are changed,” says Per-

kins.

I Letters To The

Senator Defends
Dor/In Council

Editor, The Pitt News:

It would appear that editor of
The Pitt News has become’car-
ried away with his charges of
“inaction” and “ineptitude” af-
ter the abundance of editorials
on the previous actions of Stu-
dent Goverment (SG). Mr. Cabin
has confused the inaction of SG
and the insufficient reporting of
the accomplishments of Men's
Dormitory Council (MDC), as
well as other student organiza-
tions and groups. ~

Both Mr. Cabin of The Pitt
News and’SG Senator John Rus-
kay have charged that “there
has been inaction by MDC” for
this term as well as several

years previously. Mr. Cabin,_ it-
would seem, writes stirring edi-_

torials for his paper yet neglects
to read the other articles con-
tained therein. For example:
“More Student Seating Available”

_ in which it was speciﬁcally stated

that MDC had requested this ad-
dition to student section in the
Stadium due to the. large inﬂux
of Freshmen. Sept. -22, “MDC
Passes New Rules for Tower Dor-
mitories,” which list such revi-
sions in the social rules for the
dormitories as the decrease in
the required number of chap-
erones for each social event, and
permitting only one couple to re-
main in a “living-study -room.”

Other articles appeared Sept.
24, Oct. 1, and Oct. 27 dealing
with such actions of lVﬂ)C as the
request for tighter security, a
review of the Tower’s Lobby

_ Rules, and lately the news of the

*3"

social hours bill, which provided
for a committee to study the pre-
sent social rules in the Towers
and make recommendations.
MDC has been charged with
being inactive. I would ask Mr.
Cabin and Mr. Ruskay if their

mitories. On page.27, the Official
Handbook, under the heading
“Student Government,” states
that Student Government has
jurisdiction “. . _
which affect‘ both men and wom-
en and which. do not fall under
the jurisdiction . . . officially rec-
ognized s tu d en t organizations
functioning in specialized areas.”
On the next page MDC is listed
as one of these officially rec-
ognized organizations.

Editor, The Pitt News:

In reply to Alex D’Ippolito’s
editorial in The Pitt News of Nov.
1. I was shocked to learn that
those who do not support the
United States ‘policy in Vietnam
do not represent the future of

America. Well, all you “provoca-

tive loudmouths and demonstra-
tors” who oppose our Vietnam
policy (if you can call it our po-
licy) don't despair because we

‘haven't been disinherited from

the American future as of yet;
unless Washington adopts Mr.
D’Ippolito’s policy as its own.

I do agree with the writer on

one point; and that is his state-

ment that “this voice came from
the heart.” It didn’t come from
the mind which is proven by the
various signs _carried in the rally
stating such enlightning bits of
wisdom as>“We Got Guts,” “The
University Isn't Run by These”

(referers to beatnicks), and “We

Want a Large Draft of Draft
Dodgers.” I must admit that I
was unable to ﬁnd a sign bearing
the slogan “A Splendid’ Little

Editor

War.” Still these marchers should
be commended because they are

a civilized group and they do »

“bury their dead.”

The last thing I take objection
to in this editorial is the state-
ment “it is those who will pre-

A serve the heritage‘ of the past

and improve upon it in the fu-
ture.” To me this implies that the
past is so perfect that to -veer
sharply from tradition would be
catastrophic to American "life.
Conserving stagnant doctrines of
the past. will only lead to more
and more social turmoil and ten-
sion within the world. It is about

time that the public ‘awakened

to the fact that Communism is
not the real bogey man of the
present and the future, but in-
stead that it is blind nationalism
and imperialism. Surely the po-
licy makers in Washington could
ﬁnd a better answer to Asian
nationalism and imperialism; than
American nationalism and im-
perialism in its moral cloak.
These two powerful ideas are
from the past and I hardly feel
that this type of heritage needs

conserving‘ and improving. In-\

stead we should take a sharp
veer and pursue a policy that
takes into account that what‘ is
good for America is not neces-
sarily good for the other peoples
of the world. Instead of pursu-

iirig a policy of selﬁsh self inter-

est we should pursue a policy of

true interest for the welfare of ‘

manki’nd which will enable us
to live in peace. We shouldn’t be
afraid to take the ﬁrst step even
thought it is a momentous one
filled with uncertainty, because
by not taking the ﬁrst step we
remain stationary and stagnant
in an ever changing world.

Case in Point

News Fitly

 

Printed.
By Marsha Rehns

The recent suicide of Daniel Burros, Grand Dragono

the Ku Klux Klan in charge of ‘New York, raises the basic
question of journalistic responsibility in news coverage. 7 

Burros, also a member of the American Nalzi-Party and:
other anti-semitic organizations, was confronted by a New
York Times reporter with the fact that his parents had beefs,
married. in a Jewish ceremony and that he himself had beeii‘

confirmed in the Jewish faith. ‘~

BURROS told the reporter that if the
story was published, “I’ll have to retaliat‘
.. . . I'll kill you . . . I'll be ruined. This_'1‘s,__ 
all I’ve got to live for. The story of Bur‘
ros’s background was published and. the
same day the Klan leader was found dead.
supposedly by suicide although he was in
the apartment of a fellow klansman‘ wh___
said he struggled with Burros for the mu "
der weapon. 

REPORTER McCandlish Phillips had probably heard
similar threats before. The story was a somewhat sens
tional one (although Phillips’s treatment of it was straight‘-
news style). Phillips was faced with the'~“ruination” of,a, :
Klan leader, a threat of murder or some other formiof rf
taliation, and a -reader-capturing story. Should he ‘hay
printed it? Certainly. I ‘ '

\

THE SAME problem is faced by those who-publishla
expose’ on, a prominent political ﬁgure, report on a U.S. mi
sle failure, or criticize a new play by a here-to-fore success
ful playwright. The basic problem in all three is ruinatio
in the eyes of various numbers of people, although all th
effects are theisame. ’ ' -‘

In the first, a man may lose a career although (if thee
report is correct) justly. In the second, an important imag
is lost and in the third,,weeks of preparation, not to mentio,
large amounts of capital, are wasted. In Burros.-’s case,”
member of a vicious. organization is shown to have an in
credible background, so deleterious to his career, death’ ,
the only way out. 

BRINGING the situation closer to home, there is
coverage given this summer to Eric Crabtree’s arrest fo
stealing hubcaps or the article in today’s Pitt News on th
library theft by Sig Norr. Possibly neither will be terribl-
affected by the reporting, but itcould be argued that their

   

 

How much, then, does the public deserve to be told
“Everything” encompasses anything from missile failuret
the sadistic sensationalism of the National Enquirer. “Tha
news without deleterious effects” is too strict and to ditfi
cult a line to draw. _ ’ ’

AN INTELLIGENT editor must present his readers,
with all the news of pertinence to their daily lives; as Ameri
cans, or“”as Jews, or as University students. The problemis
not so much in the news but its presentation. The story
which destroys a political candidate in one paper can simplf
give an analytical insight to personality in another. I _

The information available to Phillips from “a Jewis,
agency” was certainly as available to the Klan. The ruina-
tion was in Burros’s own eyes. f 

The public, then, deserves to know all that which
touches it in any of its roles. The burden rest with the edi;
tor to see that the news is in its proper perspective bo_t_hii_i_
writing and placing in the newspaper so that public reaction
is  rational

. After two of the most lop-
‘sided defeats in Panther
‘football history, the spirit of
the players, especially those
on the defensive unit has to
be‘ questioned. Defensive
‘tackle Bob Guzinsky feels that
the team is .down but not by any
means out.
“Nobody is going to quit or
give up," Guzinsky said. “The
squad doesn’t have a defeatist
‘attitude; and who knows, there's
‘nothing to prevent us from
“bouncing back and giving South-
ern Cal. and Penn State ﬁts.”
Guzinsky places most of the
‘blame for the Syracuse and Notre
Dame holocausts on himself and
the other players. “We played
' real ﬁne ball until we hit Syra-
cuse,’.’ he noted. “We were in
: virtually every ball game. Then,
—‘all of a sudden, everybody seem-
ed to be making mistakes.”
“Our defenses were designed
to stop the‘ power plays of both
teams," Guzinsky continued. “We
just couldn’t execute them prop-
erly. I made some stupid mis-
takes last Saturday, mistakes
that Coach Steigman taught me
not to make.
“What can I say?” Guzinsky
 asked. “I think I'm trying hard
I. but I ‘don't seem to be playing
' good ball. When (Larry) Conjar
went for that long touchdown, I
had their tackle (Dick) Arrington
_taken care ‘of. But as I: reached
out to grap Conjar he was by
me.” .
. Notre Dame’s Arrington gave
Guzinsky problems all afternoon.

explain,” Guzinsky said. “We
average only about 215 or 220 up
front. Other teams outweigh us
by as much as 20 pounds a man.
You can’t sacriﬁce that gmuch
weight and expect to stall a
rushing oﬁense.”

This week in practice, Guzin-
sky was moved to offensive team

“He’s very strong, very big, and
has good moves,” Guzinsky said.
“I expected trouble from him.
But I didn't expect trouble from
their second stringers, who gave
me just as tough a time.”
Every team that has a good
ground attack gives the Panthers
a tough time. “It’s very easy to

for the ﬁrst time this season.
“The coaches are experimenting,
I guess. I love defense and I’ll
probably still play there on Sat-
urday.”. I

Whether or not Guzinsky is
switched with two games re-
maining in his career matters lit-
tle. As he himself said, “this en-
tire season is a shame, because
at the beginning I thought that
we had the potential to be a
Bowl team.” /

Philip, ZBT Reach Football Finals;

Hawthorne Trips Keystone in Dorm

Phi Epsilon Pi and Zeta
Beta Tau both gained spots
in the ﬁnals of their respec-
tive IFC intramural football
leagues this week with vic-
tories. Monday. iHawthorne
House moved into the Dorm

' League semi-finals.

Phi Ep defeated Pi Lambda
Phi in double overtime in an “A”
league semi-ﬁnals, and ZBT trip-
ped Delta Iota Delta in the “B”
league game, 13-6. Hawthorne
blanked Keystone House, 13-0,
last Thursday.

Phi Ep outgained Pi Lam ﬁve
yards to minus 19 in the second
overtime period to earn the right

U" to meet Sigma Chi ‘in the league

ﬁnals. Andy Wiener ran for the
yardage. Phi Ep had mounted
three offensive drives earlier but
'never could cross the Pi Lam
goal. Dave Brinn intercepted
three passes, one in overtime,

and Richie Miller and Ken Brooks
led the pass rush. >

Steve Merkin ﬁred two scoring
passes to Tom Geiger, covering
50 yards in the second period and
10 yards in the third quarter for
the Zeeb’s victory. Mark Pollak‘
was especially effective as a pass
rusher and blocking halfback,
and Geiger saved the game with
a clutch interception in the
fourth quarter. ZBT now meets
Theta Chi_ for the “B” league
championship.

Steve Solnoki led defending
Dorm league champion Haw-
thorne into a semi-ﬁnal pairing
with Panther House. The winner
meets Roaring 20’s for the league
title. Solnoki ran 20 yards for

Hawthorne’s ﬁrst score in the
third period and passed 40 yards
to Steve Cohan to clinch the
game in the fourth quarter. Key-
stone’s major threat came ‘in the
third period when they moved
to the Hawthorne. 18-yard line,
only to have a pass intercepted
in the end zone by the winners’

John Hylwa. Solnoki added an

interception in the fourth quar-
ter.
