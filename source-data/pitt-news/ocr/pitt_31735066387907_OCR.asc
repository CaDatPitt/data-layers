UF begins effort
for faculty votes

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

The United Faculty has launched its campaign to
represent the Pitt faculty in collective bargaining.

“If the faculty choose to enter into collective
bargaining, we will have the unique opportunity to
build a strong, positive, cooperative relationship
between faculty and administration, based on a new
balance of authority and responsibility,” according to
a platform statement released by the UF,

In November the Pennsylvania Labor Board ruled
that Pitt faculty could vote on whether or not to
unionize.

The administration recently announced that it will
not attempt to seek a court order to stop the election
while they decide whether to appeal, though Pitt
President Wesley Posvar remains opposed to the idea
of a faculty union.

“My years at the university convince me that faculty

interest and would henceforth alter the character of
the university,” Posvar wrote in a letter to the faculty.

“We were quite pleased that the administration
chose not to try any longer to block the faculty from
voting,” Wion said.

The PLRB has set a pre—election conference for
Tuesday, where representatives from UF, the
administration and the PLRB will discuss the issues
surrounding faculty unionization. Wion said that he
expects the election, which will probably be done by
mail ballot, to be held in late February or early March.

UF has sent a document detailing the UF platform
and what UF would do if the faculty votes in favor of
unionization. The case for unionization centers on

unionization would not be in our best common‘

Byjennifer Calabrese
News Editor

The presidentia1—search committee has
narrowed the choice for Pitt’s new
president to 40 candidates.

The 24-member search committee has
been busy since it was chosen in late
September by Board of Trustees
Chairperson John Marous. The process
began with placing ads in the Chronicle of
Hz'gberEducation and the New Yorle Times
education section. The committee also
sent out an eight—page document to
about 100 universities, foundations and
associations.

“The document includes brief
background information about the

university and talks a little bit about what
the issues surrounding the university are
as we look to the future and what some
broad qualiﬁcations we think are required
of our new president,” said Farrell
Rubenstein, chairperson of the search
committee.

Much of Rubenstein’s work has involved
personally contacting people.

“We have sent letters to everybody in
the university community asking them for
any recommendations they may have for
candidates. In addition to that, we have
spent a good deal of time, myself in
particular but with the help of a number
of members of the committee, talking to
everybody we possibly can talk to, all of
the constituencies at this university,”

Rubenstein said.

Rubenstein has visited Pitt’s four regional
campuses and has talked to many student,
faculty and alumni groups about their
concerns about the new president. The
committee has held open hearings for the
university community to air its concerns
and suggestions about the presidential
search.

The committee broke into subgroups to
review the applications that it received.
The next step in the process will be
interviewing the candidates.

“We anticipate that for January and part
of February we will be interviewing a
number of candidates on campus or at
some regional location. From that process
we aim to take eight or six who we

consider to be finalists, bring them to
campus and give those people an
opportunity to see our campus. At that
time, somewhere from Feb. 20 to Apr. 15
we have finalists on campus to interview,
to see our campus,” Rubenstein said.

Rubenstein said that he expects to have
a narrow list of three candidates to give to
the Board of Trustees chairperson's office
by the end of March or the beginning of
April. The chairperson’s office consists of
Marous and the two vice chairpersons,
Howard Love and Frank Mosier.

“They will make V the final
recommendation to the Board of T rustees,”
Rubenstein said. “It is the responsibility of
the search committee to take input, to get

Students must register as conscientious objectors before draft

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

Being drafted doesn’t
necessarily mean having to fight
in a war.

“If there’s going to be a draft,
then all I believe is that students
should know all the facts,” said
Pitt teaching assistant Maurice
Rickard. “They should know their
options if they want to become a
conscientious objector.”

Rickard, who teaches in the
English department, became
interested in what being a CO
means and how to become one

when a student shared his concern
about the draft. They started to
research conscientious objection.
“There are two different kinds of
CO5,” said Rickard. “The
difference is in what one is
opposed to. In the first instance,
a student might be supportive of
war but is unwilling to kill. If that
student becomes a CO, he will be
put in a MASH [medical] unit,
battalion aid or some other part
of the military that does not
involve killing.”

Rickard said that the second
kind of CO is opposed to all
kinds of war and killing. During

a draft this type of CO would be
kept in the United States and
would have to work in soup
kitchens or do other forms of
community work.

Rickard got his information
from the Friends of Pittsburgh, a
Quaker house located on
Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside.

“We, as Quakers, have
traditionally been conscientious
objectors and have been
counseling people in this area
since the Vietnam War,” said
Celeste McCurdy, the caretaker
of Friends of Pittsburgh. “When
you sign up for the draft at age

18, there is no place to sign in as
a CO.”

McCurdy said that students only
have 10 days to report for duty
after they have received their
draft notices. According to
McCurdy, this is not enough time
to become a CO.

“A person needs a ﬁle in order
to be classified as a CO at a place
where trained counselors are
acknowledged, like Friends of
Pittsburgh,” said McCurdy. ‘‘If a
student is interested in becoming
a CO, they should call for a
counselin g session with us or any
other place that will counsel them

and keep a file for them to prove
they are a CO.”

During that session a student
will be given information on being
a CO and will be asked questions
to determine where he or she
stands on the issues of war and
killing, according to McCurdy. If
after that session, the student
feels that being a CO is the right
decision, then Friends of
Pittsburgh will help the student
start a file. The ﬁle, according to
McCurdy, consists of an essay
about why the student believes
in conscientious objection, along
with several references.

Though Indian women have
equality within the law, it is not
implemented, according to Dr.

J Ania Loomba.

An associate Professor at the
Center for Linguistics and English
atjawahorlal Nehru University in
India, Loomba spoke on the
topic “Women and the Past Year
in India” yesterday.

Loomba said historically

women’s questions have been at
the forefront of many political
issues in India such as better
education and equal pay. Women
are given equal rights in the Indian
constitution and receive equal
pay for equal work, said Loomba.

Loomba said in the early 1980's
women began to articulate their
needs themselves. Though many
Indian women hold prestigious
jobs along side men this initial
pictures does not reﬂect the
realpicture of India, and the many

ways women are oppressed.
These rights are given to
women in the Indian constitution
because men articulated these
needs, said Loomba. .
One example Loomba gave was
the relationship between the
women of India with the police.
Loomba said under the law
women are protected from being
beat by their husbands, but these
laws are not implemented.
Often times, Loomba said,
wives are murdered by their

husbands for not bringing in
enough dowry to the husbands
family, this is called dowry death-
The police frequently label these
murders as suicides and never
fully investigate them, said
Loomba.

Feminists in India are asking
for revision of this law against
dowry death because the present
laws are not just, said Loomba.

“Why call them ‘dowry deaths’?
Why not dowry mu rde r?" Loomda
asked.

as much information as we
possibly can, to try to mold a
consensus of what we want our
new president to look like, to try
to ﬁnd some people that look
like that and to make those
recommendations to the board.”

The Board of Trustees will then
vote on whether to approve the

0 final candidate that the chairman's

office submitted.
Rubenstein said that the

committee is on schedule, with
the expected date for naming
Pitt’s new president set for the
end of this academic year.

“As best as I can determine,
yes, we are not slipping. Time
will tell though; the tough time
will be when we get down to
interviewing the finalists. Right
now we are right on schedule,”
Rubenstein said.

Rubenstein has repeatedly
stressed the importance of

keeping the names of the
applicants confidential, citing that
many applicants might currently
be holding positions elsewhere
and would not want it known
that they were considering
another ‘job.

“The only things that we are
trying to keep confidential are
the recommendations and the

_ names of the candidates that we

are looking at. As far as process
and procedure, we are trying to

be as public as possible. There
are no secrets about [the process]
and what we are doing,”
Rubenstein said.

Rubenstein added that the
professional search firm hired by
the committee is working well.

“The professional search ﬁrm
is performing a support function
for us. They are gathering
information when we need it,
getting credentials when we need
it."

SAW’ helps wo rld traveler

By Lane Hornfeck
Suﬁ‘ W1-iter '

To prepare for their upcoming
travels, students at Pitt can take
advantage of an have an
organization devoted entirely to
helping them understand and
appreciate all aspects of the Study
Abroad Program.

Founded in 1983 Students
Around the World, an extension
of the Study Abroad Program, is
a student- run organization which
attempts to make the entire
process less formal.

“SAW is a fun and informal
component of the Study Abroad
Program. It is a chance forstudents
to talk to people who have already
been there. Plainly, it is
information to the interested
student without the formalities,”
SAW Vice President Tracy Seeley
said.

The members of SAW illustrate

A to new members or inquiring

students all of the “ins and outs”
of the program through personal
experiences. .

“We want students to know
that there is a whole social
network which they can be
involved in,” Seeley said.

Seeley and Nicky Cromis,
president of SAW, are attempting
to re-establish the meaning of
Students Around the World to all
Pitt students.

“It is basically for awareness of
the organization, to let people
actually know what is out there
for them,” Seeley said.

By joining SAW students can
learn about the “different types
of program models” which help
familiarize them with the program
concerning money, academics,
and personal interests, Seeley
said.

Greeks change rush policy

By Karen D. Speece

and Christopher Barthel
The Pitt News

The traditional Greek rush period began last
night with a few changes in rush policy.

Held at the beginning of each semester, rush
provides interested non—Greeks the opportunity
to acquaint themselves with the fraternities or
sororities they have a desire to join. Rush events
are sponsored by each house to help attract
potential members and to allow brothers or
sisters to discuss their houses, members and
standards. I _

“Meet the Greeks,” the first official rush
function, was held last night in the William Pitt

Union Ballroom. Representatives from each
house were on hand to meet potential rushees.

The changes include a limit of seven brothers
per house established for “Meet the Greeks” this
term to give rushees more freedom and to
alleviate some of the pressure associated with
choosing a fraternity.

“There will be less brothers standing around
talking to each other,” said Gil Borok, a brother
of Delta Tau Delta. He added that because of the
new rule, the rushees will feel more comfortable.

Some students who had previously attended A

“Meet the Greeks” noticed a difference. “It’s not
as crowded as it was in the fall,” Josh Hollywood,
a rushee, said. "It's nicer not having it as full.”

three sets of issues, according to
Wion.

The first is the governance and
decision-making process at Pitt.
“Decision-making processes
would be much more orderly
and there will be a better balance

agreement," Wion said.

Collective bargaining would
also allow for clearer policies and
contractual agreements, ac-
cording to Wion.

“That way, if there is a dispute,
the administration is bound to

The second set of issues deals
with economic.

“Clearly much needs to be done
to make salary more rational and
less arbitrary. Salaries certainly
need to be improved, and

and for administrators," Wion
said.

The third set of issues concern
faculty who have special needs.

“There are a number of groups
of faculty who have special
circumstances and needs which

can be addressed through

bargaining,” Wion said. “Part-
time faculty clearly need to have
their working conditions and
salaries improved. "

The faculty at the regional
campuses need to have their
salaries brought into a more
appropriate commensurate
relationship with those at the

“Librarians also need to have
much better recognition of their
professional con-tributions; their
working conditions need to be

professional status," Wion said.

Full—time faculty who are
currently outside the tenure stream
would also be helped by collective
bargaining, according to Wion.

“Protections need to be put in
place for all non—tenured faculty,
to protest academic freedom. All
too often, people who lack job
security experience a chilling effect
on their right to speak out and to
exercise academic freedom. There
are large numbers of people now

Save the strippers. ..

Americans in the Middle East must deal with a culture
in which women must be clothed from head to toe. If the
state of Indiana gets its way, some women will at least
have to be wearing something (or more than just G-
strings).

The state is attempting to outlaw all public nudity,
especially in barrooms. To do this, they are asking the U.S.
Supreme Court to grant states the right to ban barroom-
style dancing.

State officials say that they are “striking a blow for
traditional notions of what constitutes public decency.”
But they are really making an attempt to infringe on the
First Amendment.

In 1981 the Supreme Court ruled that nude dancing had
protection under the First Amendment. Although the
reach of the protection was never clearly defined, it was
clearly protected to some extent. Now Indiana wants to
strip that protection completely. ‘

Two bars in South Bend, Ind., the Kit Kat Lounge and
the Chippewa Club, along with three dancers, faced the
Supreme Court Tuesday, as did Indiana officials. The
Indiana government wants to ban all public nudity.

However, the state went even further. While the Indiana
legislators originally maintained that they only sought to
rid the state of this nuisance, they then decided to seek a
“blanket ban” on public nudity. This means that all public
nudity, even that in operas and plays, would have to be
eliminated.

In recent Supreme Court rulings, obscenity is defined as
something which “depicts or describes in a patently
offensive way sexual conduct and lacks serious literary,
artistic, political orscientific value.” Though nudity may
be offensive to some, it does not fall into this category.
Therefore, it can not be termed as such by Indiana or by
any state.

Furthermore, the Kit Kat Lounge and Chippewa Club,
along with other bars of this nature, are closed off from
the street. People who do not want to be exposed to them
do not have to be. Only people who are willing to watch
exotic dancing are in the clubs.

Indiana Attorney General Wayne Uhl contended that
the dancing in the bars does not constitute “expressive
activity” or speech. However, there is a ruling under the
First Amendment that also protects freedom of expression.
Therefore, the Supreme Court should rule in favor of the
clubs.

The lawyer for the clubs and three of the dancers said,
“It is not the business of the state to determine what is
trash and what is of value.” This is true, as Indiana seeks
a ban on all nudity, artistic or not.

Updates:

As if anybody cares 

-It’s so nice to see that Gov.
Robert Casey has taken a firm
stand on how to treat higher
education in this state: badly.

If you haven’t heard, Casey
discovered, to his dismay, that
Pennsylvania is falling into debt
—— more than a billion dollars, to

be exact. So how does Mr. Casey
plan to find these funds? Simple:

by taking them from people who
are least able to give it to him:
college students. Yep, he cut 3.5
percent from each college and
university in the state.

In case you’re wondering, that
means $5.5 million from Pitt. And
since the university will have to
ignore the tuition cap to come up
with its own funds, that means
higher tuition for everybody. Gee,
what a surprise. It's really strange
when you can’t blame a university
for raising its tuition. And you
can’t because they have to get the
money from somewhere, and the
only other place would be from
student programs. Seeing as this
campus already lacks student
enthusiasm, though, maybe it
wouldn’t be such a bad idea.

-Speaking of the Casey
administration, it has taken yet
another tough stand on important
issues: the morals of drivers on
our highways. Yeah, anyone
caught producing, selling or
displaying “obscene” bumper
stickers canbe lined up to $10,000
and be sentenced to five years in
jail.

This law came from state Rep.
Thomas Scrimenti (D. — Erie),
who “ﬂies off the handle” every
time he sees “defecation [in terms
of] ‘something happens. ”’ So if he
had his way, this slogan would
be illegal to place on your car. I
wou1dn’twony too much, though.
This law is virtually impossible to
enforce, not to mention a blatant
violation of the FirstAmendment.

Let me repeat this, in case you
are so dumbfounded by this
outrageous ruling: If you have a
bumper sticker that reads
“S.S.D.D.,” watch out! You could
be a wanted person.

 

Jeff
Tatusko

A word of advice to Rep.
Scrimenti and the rest of the
legislature: Lighten up.

-The Soviet Union seems to be
digging itself a nice big grave
these days.

Two days ago, Soviet savior
Mikhail Gorbachev sent about
10,000 more troops to quell
disturbances in those pesky Baltic
states. Oh, you know, the ones
that want everything: freedom,
sovereignty, rights. Well,
Gorbachev will have none of that,
so here come the troops, ready
and willing to stop anything.

Gorbachev has given himself
so many new powers lately that
it’s easy enough for him to do
things like this without doing
anything messy, like getting
permission from the Supreme
Soviet. At the rate he’s going, he’ll
be out by, say, July.

Can you say “authoritarian,”
boys and girls? No? OK, how
about “civil war?”

0 Speaking of our friends in the
Kremlin, we actually lost one last
month.

In protest against Gorbachev’s
new powers, Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze surprised
everybody by resigning. He said
that he felt the Soviet president
was gaining too much power and
becoming too authoritarian.
(Sound familiar?)

Shevardnadze was actually the
closest thing this country has had
to a friend in the Kremlin. He was
in favor of the foreign—policy
revolution by Gorbachev. He

asey

to soaps

really believed it could work.
Too bad he didn’t have the same
confidence in Gorbachev.

The most troubling thing, for
Gorbachev is that the two men
were very good friends, and this
resignation caught everybody off-
guard. Remember that grave I
talked about earlier? I think this
resignation put a Soviet foot in it.

-I hate deadlines.

Five days from now, the Iraqis
must pull out of Kuwait, or at
least make some effort to do so.
Otherwise we will go in, and a
bloody mess will take place. An
ultimatum to end all ultimatums.

As a journalist I know the
meaning of deadlines. I’m sure
that Saddam Hussein knows them
as well. I just wish he was as big
a procrastinator as I am.

-But wait. Here comes
Congress to save the day. It wants
to debate about the situation
before giving President Bush the
OK to destroy (excuse me ——
free) Kuwait. Everyone knows
it’s so important for Congress to
give its approval for this.

Of course, it’s not like Congress
didn’t have the chance to do that
earlier. Last month it had the
opportunity to debate the Gulf
crisis. Instead, Congress opted to
spend time on vacation. Now it
wants to save the day. Give me a
break.

-I saw something that really
irked me yesterday. In a recent
Gallup Poll more people decided
that they are more worried about
a recession than they are about
war. Excuse me, folks, but a bad
economy is kind of meaningless
when you’re dead.

-Finally, for all you “As The
World Burns” fans, here’s an
update. The Baker-Aziz meeting
in Geneva Restaurant came up
with nothing in six and a half
hours. Aziz said that Iraq will
attack Israel if war breaks out.
But will the others join him? Stay
tuned

Lady Hoopsters win three of four, up Big East record to 3-1

By Rob Mazur
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
team
returned home from a two-game
road trip Wednesday night for a
showdown against Big East foe

Villanova.

The Lady Panthers emerged
from the contest victorious, 68-
62, raising their record to 8-7
overall and 3-1 in the Big East.
Villanova dropped to 7-6 overall,
1-2 in the Big East.

The Lady Panthers were playing
their fourth game in seven days.

ﬂwo of these were on the road

against Providence and Syracuse.
“You have to win all of your
home games and at least split
your road games in order to finish
in the top of this league,” said
Coach Kirk Bruce.

“We went 3-1 over the past
four games. It’s been a rough
swing, with games last
Wednesday, Saturday, Monday
and this Wednesday. We split our
two on the road, so I’m pretty
happy-”

The game started off slowly,
with both teams exchanging
buckets until the 11:04 mark in

, the first half, when Pitt began to

pull away from its Wildcat
counterparts.

The Lady Panthers trailed only
once in the first half, 8-10, and led
by as many as eight en route to a
27-25 halftime advantage. _

“We didn’t defend the zone
very well in the first half, but we
made up for it in rebounds," said
Bruce.

2,, The Wildcats came out of the

locker room inspired at the
beginning of the second half,
gaining leads of 35-34 and 37-36
before Pitt pulled away, leading
by as many as eight points on its
way to the ﬁnal 68-62 margin.

“I felt we could have done
better, but you are always happy
when you win a game, especially
after the stretch we just finished.
I think that our strong rebounding
at the end of the game helped us
to pull out the win," said Bruce
about his team’s effort.

The Lady Panthers were led in
scoring by senior forward Lorri
Johnson with 28 points. Johnson
became only the second player
in Lady Panther history to score

. 2,000 career points in Monday’s

game against the Syracuse
Orangewomen.

The only other player to
accomplish this feat was Jennifer
Bruce (Hmmm?? Does that last
name sound familiar?) with 2,295
career points.

Johnson has led Pitt in scoring
in all but two games this season,
averaging 26 points and eight
rebounds per game.

Freshman Jonna Huemrich
scored 10 points and wiped the
boards clean for the Lady
Panthers. Guard Lisa Fessler hit
two three-pointers and scored 12
points for Pitt.

Other scorers were forward
Whitney Mack with four points,
guard Maureen McConnell with
seven and seven for forward Jill
McElhinny. - .

Villanova was led by forward
Justine Chaverini with 23 points
and forward Sheri Walker with
12 points. Other scorers for the
Wildcats were forward Renee
Groft with eight points, guard
Sandy Litkenhaus with seven,
forward Nikki Benedix with six,
guard Mary Beth Tukis with four,
and forward Eloise Berry with
IVVO.

The Lady Panthers are off until
next Wednesday when they travel
to South Orange, N.J., for a Big
East showdown with the Bucettes
of Seton Hall.

Panthers need toﬁnd
new solution toiEM T

When Providence College Coach Rick Barnes needs a bucket,
he calls for “EMT” —— as in Eric Murdock Time.

That’s what Barnes calls it when Murdock, a senior guard for
the Friars, single—handedly takes control of a game.

It was EMT last Tuesday when Murdock scored 30 points,
including the Friars’ final 13,

in a 72-69 upset of No. 16

Pitt Coach Paul Evans is hoping the same thing doesn't
happen when the Friars (10-4, 1-2) play the Panthers on
Saturday at Fitzgerald Field House.

“He’s been like a one—man wrecking crew,” said Evans. “I
think he’s been averaging about 30 points per game and even
more on the road, which is even more phenomenal.” Murdock
averages 38 points on the road, compared to 25 at home.

Murdock, selected only as a second-team All-Bi g East selection
by the coaches in the preseason, has been ﬁring in shots at a

Penguins on slow, steady upswing

By Brian Berger
Stajf Writer

Revenge can be sweet,
especially when it comes at the
hands of the defending Stanley
Cup champions and puts a team
one notch closer to the top spot
in its division. On Tuesday night
at the Civic Arena, the Pittsburgh
Penguins did both, thrashing the
Edmonton Oilers 6-1 and moving
past the surprised Philadelphia
Flyers into second place in the
Patrick Division. The Pens’ record
now stands at 23-20%, good for
49 points, eight behind the first-
place New York Rangers.

The game was over early, as
center Barry Pederson, who had
been benched eight of the last 10
games, took a centering pass from
Joe Mullen and snapped the puck
by All—Star goalie Bill Ranford at
8:12 of the first period to put the
Penguins on top. The Pens then
added three more ﬁrst—period

Analysis

goals, two on the power play,
and one each from newcomers
Scott Young and Jiri Hrdina, to
chase Ranford from the nets and
chase the Oilers from the game.
At the end of 40 minutes the
Pens had built a 5-0 lead and the
team’s second-newest player
scored his second goal of the
game. “Funky cold” Hrdina took
a pass from fellow Czech Jaromir
Jagr, pulled down Edmonton
replacement goalie Kari T akko
“Bell”, shot and then ﬂipped his
own rebound past the fallen net-
minder. Hrdina is all too familiar
with the Oilers. His former team
(Calgary Flames) is a perennial
Smythe Division rival.
Edmonton ﬁnally got on the
board just 37 seconds into the
third period, as Martin Gelinas
spoiled Tom Barrasso’s shutout
bid by wrapping a power-play

goal by him. John Cullen closed
out the scoring with his second
goal of the night and 18th of the
season on a two—on—none break
with Mark Recchi. '

Coming into the game, the
Oilers had won seven of their last
eight, including wins over the
Rangers and the Kings, and two
victories over the Flames. Maybe
it was all too much for Edmonton,
as the Oilers were nowhere to be
found on Tuesday night. The
Penguins did as they pleased,
and the Oiler defense left huge
gaping holes, particularly in the
first period, and scored four goals
from inside the slot.

This game was an exact
opposite of the last time the Oilers
were in town and drummed the
Pens 7-3 and it was the Penguins
who were frolicking around their
own end, while Glenn Anderson
and Mark Messier beat up on
Frank Pietrangelo. But this is a

“He’s a tough guy to stop,” said
Evans. “I don’t know that we can
stop him. What I'm trying to get
across to the kids is that if he
scores 30 points and we can play
good defense against everybody
else, we should be OK. It’s when
he starts banging in threes and
we start fouling him that gets us in
trouble.” 8

Murdock’s 28.7 points-per-
game average puts him 10th in
the nation in scoring,- a dramatic
increase from his 15.4 average a
year ago. Murdock also seems to
play his best against Pitt. He’s
scored 18, 21, 18 and 20 in his last

four games against the Panthers.
Providence has won three of those
games. '

“He’s having a great year,” said
Pitt guardjason Matthews. “We’re
pretty good friends. He’s been
scoring a lot. This is his senior
year, and I know he wants to
keep playing. I hope he does a
great’job against everybody —
except us.”

After losing four starters from
last year’s 17~12 team (Carlton
Screen, Marty Conlon, Abdul
Shamsid—Deen and Quinton
Burton), the time for the Friars to

win seemed like the future. But .

Helping Murdock out in that
cause is guard Chris Watts (the
only other returning starter from
last year), forward Marques Bragg
and a slew of newcomers.

“Their young kids are all starting
to improve," said Evans. “[6-9

forward Dickey] Simpkins is
playing really well, and the one
kid I6—8 forward T onyl Turner
started out 1-21 in three—pointers,
but he went three for three last
week against Holy Cross and hit

One thing the Panthers aren’t
doing is taking Murdock or the

“They’re a good team. We’ll

Hockey club begins second half of already strong season

By John Labriola
sum‘ Wﬁter

The Pitt Hockey Club will be
opening the second half of its
season this weekend against the
Saints of Penn State West.

The Panthers are beginning the
latter half of this season with a
record of 4-0-1 in the West Penn.
College Hockey Association, and
an overall record of 5-2-1. The
Panthers share first place in the
WPCHA with West Virginia
University. I

The Panthers ended the ﬁrst
half of their season with a loss to
cross-town rival Duquesne
University and a tie with Indiana
University of Pennsylvania.

In the last nine encounters the
Panthers have had with the
Duquesne Dukes, Pitt has come
away licking its wounds. '

The Panthers and the Dukes
went into overtime, only to have
‘ﬁe Dukes skate away with an 8-
7 Win.

“Every game we play with
Duquesne, we start with the lead

Pens

and the passing,” said Dave
Koval, the Panthers’ captain.
“They always come back and tie
us up.”

Both of the teams seemed to
explode on the ice. For every
goal the Panthers netted, the
Dukes were able to retaliate with
a goal of their own in end-to—end
hockey.

“Every time we scored a goal,
we let down and they came right
back and buried it,” said Koval.
“They never let us stay in the
game. Every time we tied it up,
they buried us.” I

For the most part, both squads
played a very powerful and clean
game, with the exception of a
few minor roughing calls. While
Pitt took to man-to—man coverage
of the Duquesne squad, the
Dukes geared themselves to a
more conservative game plan.

“We'_ are trying to stress
fundamentals,” said Duquesne
head coach Jim Koch, “having
defensive play in our end, taking
it man-to-man, moving the puck
a little bit quicker and having our

defensemen not taking as many
chances because [Pitt is] so
explosive.

“lPittl plays two one—on-one or
three—on-one, three—on_—two. In
general [we are] being more
cautious than we have been
during the course of the season,”
added Koch.

“[Pitt] has a very high—scoring
offense,” said Dukes assistant
coach Ray Conway. “They have
a few very good skaters,
especially Dave Koval."

“It was abig win for us,” added
Conway. “We lost three games
last weekend.”

This weekend the Panthers
will be traveling east to
Greensburg to compete against
the Saints on Saturday at the Kirk
Nevin Ice Complex. Faceoff is
set for 9:15 p.m.

PANTHER NOTES: Here are
the highlights from the first half
of the Panthers’ season (eight
games): 72 goals were scored,
whereas only 44,were given up.

different Penguin team than that
from the ‘dreadful night of Nov.
27 — sometimes.

Since Dec. 6, the Penguins
own a record of 11-6-1 and have
made a significant number of
player moves. General Manager
Craig Patrick’s first move was to

S: ship off Jim Johnson and Chris

Dahlquist (both Minnesota
natives) to the North Stars for
de fensemen Peter Ta glianetti and
ex—Capital (and always Penguin-
killer) Larry Murphy. Then Patrick
shipped big Jim Kyte to Calgary

' for Hrdina. And then the inevitable

happened, as the Penguins
shipped Robbie Brown back to
his master (Hartford GM Eddie

Johnston) for former U.S.
Olympian Scott Young.

The Pens’ reasoning for the
Minnesota deal was their need
for a big, strong defenseman (who
was supposed to be Taglianetti).
Unfortunately, he has been rather
sluggish and prone to mistakes.

STORRS, Conn. — The
University of Connecticut men’s
basketball team has added an
American ﬂag patch to its home
and away game uniforms as a
sign of support for the men and
women of the U.S. Armed Forces
who are stationed in the Middle
East.

“As we begin our Big East
Conference season, we realize
that thousands of American men
and women are a long way from
their home and loved ones,” said
UConn Coach Jim Calhoun.

“We know they have a duty to
perform, and we felt by our small
gesture of wearing an American
ﬂag patch, we’d be letting all of
__ our military personnel know that
 the UConn Huskies basketball
team supports their individual
and collective efforts to help make
our world a better place in which
.. to live. We especially wanted to

UConn hoops dons

ﬂag to honor troops

let all of the Connecticut-based
military personnel know our
thoughts and our prayers will be
with them until they return home
safely.”

“Everyone at the University of
Connecticut and within our
division of athletics is aware and
appreciative of the great personal
sacriﬁces that each member of
our military personnel is making
in the current Operation Desert
Shield procedure,” said UConn
director of athletics Lew Perkins.

“I endorse and wholeheartedly
support the decision to add the
American flag patch to the
uniforms of our basketball
student-athletes. As we perform
on the basketball court, we also
want to recognize the outstanding

performances being put forth org.‘

a daily basis around the world by
the men and women of our U.S.
armed forces.”

Showcase selects top 10

BY Dmitri Ragano

Showcase Editor

Some of our town's crankier critics use
the year-end list to nitpick, whine and
attack the state of movies in general, but
I won’t do it. The way I see it, if Nelson

' Mandela can survive 20 years in a South

African prison and make the best of it, film
critics can cope with an imperfect year of
movies. (Sound reasoning, eh?) -
So, without further ado, here are the 10
best films I saw in theaters this year. And
by best, I mean the ﬁlms that linger most
in my memory —— the ones I could see
again, ones where you leave the theater
with an unqualiﬁed “Ooooo baby! That
was a good ﬁlm.” A few of them were

released in New York and Los Angeles in
December 1989 but didn’t reach Pittsburgh
until 1990. And two of them, A Woman
Underthelnﬂuence and Performance, are
old ﬁlms shown at Pittsburgh Filmmakers
and at retrospectives at The Carnegie. I
put ‘em in there because: 1) They are
amazing, and 2) Pittsburgh Filmmakers
and the Carnegie are always showing
amazing films, and more people should
know about it!

1. A Woman Under the Inﬂuence.
The Carnegie’s retrospective on.the late
John Cassavetes was probably the most
signiﬁcant movie event of the year because
almost all of this seminal director’s work
is not yet on video. Cassavetes was the

first American independent, laying down
the blueprints forJim Jarmusch, Spike Lee,
David Lynch and others in the '80s. As a
struggling actor/director in the ’50s, he
decided to buck the Hollywood system
and make exactly the ﬁlms he wanted to
make. Using a stock cast, he made film
into an actor’s medium, incorporating
improvisation into his films.

Cassavetes explored a breadth of
humanity unmatched in American cinema.
From black be—boppers to half-crazed
housewives to philandering drunk
celebrities, Cassavetes created
unforgettable characters that seem utterly
human in a way you don’t expect from
movie characters. And as you watch these

' characters go through life’s lessons, you

find them resonating with your own
experience. And you pick apart your own
world, looking to see if you have anything
to learn from them (which you usually
do).

Cassavetes’ theme was the search for
love, which he compared to the quest for

the Holy Grail. In A Woman Under the .

Influence, his. 1972 masterpiece,

Cassavetes’ wife, Gena Rowlands, plays a .

suburban housewife coming to grips with
her marriage, her children and a society
that deems her insane. Dazzling.

Close—up of
year in films

By Matthew Myers
S ta_[)“ Writer

In the 1930s, while many
American industries were
toppling to the ground as a result
of the Great Depression,
Hollywood was one of the few
businesses to experience a

tremendous surge in revenues. .

Although people had little success
in earning enough money to feed
their families, they always seemed
to have plenty of dough to spend
at the movie theaters. Films like
Top Hat, Duck Soup, Bringing
Up Baby and His Girl Friday
allowed people to escape from
their miserable lives to the comfort
of a darkened theater, -where
they could enjoy someone else’s
good time. '_

In 1990 the same principle
seems to have manifested itself,
but instead of Fred Astaire, Ginger
Rogers and Cary Grant, American
audiences have embraced Kevin
Costner, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Julia Roberts as their
cinematic icons.

But even though 1990 was a
year for substantial box—ofﬁce
receipts (thanks to the
aforementioned folks), the
industry's ﬁnancial total can be
safely called mediocre at best.
While people flocked to movie
houses for Ghost, Pretty Woman
and Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, everyone seemed to stay
away from financial monsters like
Dick Tracy, Days of Thunder and
RoboCop 2. ,

One of the reasons for this
unexpected downturn was
Hollywood's self—imposed
sequelism. Maybe Americans
have finally realized that the
sequel market is just so damn
packed full of mindless factory
garbage that mere confusion
would assign those ﬁlms a number
after the title for home-video

Highlights from the world of pop music

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

As the start of a new decade 1990 was a banner
year. Thankfully, Milli Vanilli turned out to bea no-
talent, sham duo, and Vanilla Ice proved himself to
be the true borrow—happyjackass he is.

We suffered some great losses in the past year as
well,- Stevie Ray Vaughn, Leonard Bernstein and
Stiv Bators were just a few.

After close brushes with the ‘Moral Majority’s”
censorship eﬁbrts, sensibility prevailed enough to
allow the "artistic expression ” of 2 Live Crew, Judas
Priest and Robert Mapplethorpe to continue, not to
mention the battle they fought for every other artist
in the country.

As each yearpasses and everyone tries to improve

on his or her previous accomplishments, new and ,

exciting things happen. The following are just a few
of my personal favorites, music-wise, from 1990.

oRap made a true onslaught in 1990 and

established itself as a permanent and powerful
fixture in the music scene. Public Enemy’s Fear of
a Black Planet and Digital Underground’s Sex
Packets were probably two of the more potent rap
albums of the year, even though their airplay was
minimal. .

Sex Packets set the tone for the hip-hop craze,
while Fear of a Black Planet provided a biting shot’
at our country’s growing racial unrest. I’ve heard
rumors that Public Enemy has alleged that its bass

.line is part of Madonna’s latest hit, “Justify My

Love.” That’s a switch — pop stars borrowing from
rappers!

0 It seems as though Neil Young has been around
forever. More power to ‘im if he can keep making
great music. Neil had two biggies that went mostly
unnoticed (as usual) in 1990: Ragged Glory, with
Crazy Horse, and Freedom. Young has the uncanny
ability to change musical styles from song to song,
and yet when you hear it, you know it’s Neil. He’s

1. Naked City (Elektra).
Simply put, Naked City is the
band that can play anything.
Saxophonist John Zorn and his

movie soundtracks and funk, to

Naked City plays a few of these
styles within the borders of a

The fact that the members of-

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January It), 1990

Manchester, so much to answer for...
New psychedelic dance-rock shaking up internatialmusic sen

By David M. Krivda
Staﬁ“ Writer

“Rave on! Rave onlﬂ’ is the most
current exultation among British
youth as it files into clubs,
warehouses and abandoned
airplane hangars all over England.
Upon entering these “raves,” the
youngsters are about to take off
on an all-night kaleidoscopic
dance ﬂight, complete with the
coolest tunes and all the drugs
they can eat.

The general fashion call for the
evening seems to flash back to an
archaic Monkees re-run -—— super

1 bowl haircuts, baggy paisley

shirts, Doc Martens and 26-inch
bell-bottoms. No, this isn’t a new
and twisted Saturday-morning
Scooby Doo spinoff starring
Shaggy. This is the Manchester
scene. .

In the wake of Britain's late-
’70s punk explosion, Manchester,
England, has served as the

1 premiere breeding ground for

Euro-pop. Beginning with the
early-’80s emergence of such
“Mancs” or “Mancunians” as the
Smiths, New Order and the
Buzzcocks, the Manchester scene
has clearly redefined the
boundaries of pop music.

But the latest raving wave of
Manc bands has taken it all a step
further than their more sullen
predecessors —- they’ve created
a new cultural movement. The
new sound is buoyant,
retrospectively psychedelic and
wildly dance—oriented —— a
manifestation of American hip-
hop and quasi-folkish late-’60s

 

rock. The result is a musical
inﬂuence that has spawned a
crusade of kids in hippie glad
rags who live to shake their bones
and indulge in chemical
refreshment.

“The scene,” as ex—Smiths
guitaristjohnny Marr told a British
tabloid, “is a celebration of being
a young white guy with a little bit
of hash in your pocket and a
really cool haircut.”

The Mancunian scene began
taking shape in the mid-'80s at
the Hacienda, Manchester’s
legendary dry bar, where the
music and atmosphere have
always been too hip for European
words. In 1986, disc jockeys took
to spinning Detroit-based house
music, which soon provided a
new dance craze among the
venue’s clientele. But within
months the Manchester
movement had stumbled upon
the flower power it needed, when
two Djs ventured to Ibiza, the
Mediterranean escape for Britain’s
working class.

What they-found there was
Balearic Beat music and Ecstasy
-—— a designer hallucinogen
(known in Manc speak as “X” or
“E”) that makes its user fall in
love with anything and everything
in sight. The fusion of lightweight
Euro—pop, house music and
Balearic beats with Ecstasy-
induced illusions generated the
neo-psychedelic style that now
epitomizes Manchester. 1

Since then, the Hacienda has
played host to all the Mancunian
media darlings. The Byrds-like
Stone Roses were one of the first

and have already had a nibble of
commercial success in the States.
The Roses’ brazen front man, Ian
Brown, made tabloid headlines
earlier this year when he snubbed
the Rolling Stones’ invitation to
open two sold-out dates at Giants
Stadium. In the meantime, their
self-titled debut album was
soaring to the top of the U.S.
college charts.

The drug-induced Happy
Mondays were another, making
their living peddling “X” to
teenage rave regulars while laying
down a trippy sound that
endeared them to the English
lasses.

“We used to take advantage of
girls taking “E” for the first time
and have naughty sex parties,”
reminisces the Mondays’ founding
father, Shaun Ryder. The band
has just released the follow-u p to
1988’s Bummed called Pills ‘N’

Thrills and Bellyacbes which
features the No. 1 indie dance-
chart smash, “Groovy Kinky Afro.”

But recently, the Charlatans
have basked in the Manchester
limelight with their late-’60s, Deep

Purple-ish sound. Their dominant «

retro—organs and “Love Boat”
Theme wah-wah guitars have
earned them a U.K. No. 1 spot
with their debut LP Some Friendly.

In addition to their native land,
these Mancs have hit America's
shores to storm the college charts,
each making their case for a shot
at Yankee-style mega-stardom.
In succession, the Roses, the
Sundays and currently the
Charlatans have reigned at the
No. 1 position and have also

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, January 10, 1990

S—3

 

For The Pitt News

With the new year upon us it’s
time to look back at the rap music
of 1990. This was the year for rap.
Not only did it explode on the
commercial scene, but it also
brought us new talents that will
be with listeners for a long time
to come.

This was the year of the nasty‘

and the clean. 2 Live Crew gave
the public the worst possible “rap”
from a musical standpoint yet
cashed in on the censorship hype.
Vanilla Ice and M.C. Hammer
danced their way into the living
rooms of the young, while both
artists fought for the position of
No. 1 album in the country.

It was a year in which the
female rap scene was truly
noticed. Salt ‘n’ Pepa returned
with a new, more mature style,
while B.W.P., Yo-Yo, Monie Love
and Harmony gave us a taste of
the new “girl thang."

It was an excellent year for rap
music, not only in sales but also
in shedding knowledge. So
without wasting further time, here
is my own Top 10 of the Year in
Rap.

1. Public Enemy — Fear of A
Black Planet (Columbia).

This is always the hardest
choice. P.E. really stood out this
year. Chuck D, Flavor Flav and
company kicked the funky jam
with this release. Listen to “91 1 Is
ajoke,” “Burn-Hollywood Burn,”
“Anti-Nigger Machine” and

“Welcome to the Terror Dome,”

and you'll see what I mean.

2. Boogie Down Productions
— Edutainment (Jive/RCA).

KRS—One shares his philosophy
of the world and life in general.
His “educational” style reigns
supreme. This was a solid effort
but just couldn't catch up to P.E.
Check out “Love’s Gonna Get
‘Cha” and “Beef.”

3. A Tribe Called Quest ——
People’s Instinctive Travels and
Paths of Rhythm Give/RCA).

Q-Tip and crew gave us a new
style of “daisy hip—hop.” The Tribe
uses the most interesting samples
on this release, from Stevie
Wonder to Lou Reed. “I Left My
Wallet in El Segundo” was one of
the year’s top singles. ’

4. ErikB. and Rakim-———Let The
Rhythm Hit ‘Em (MCA).

Erik B. and Rakim show us
once again that “they ain't no
joke. ” This was not their strongest
release but still was one of the
best of 1990. Title track is on.

5. Ice Cube — Amerileleleas
Most Wanted (Priority).

The members of N.W.A. should.

be kicking themselves for letting
the Cub go. He showed us allsthat
he wasn't “gonna go out like a
sucker.” As hard as he is, Cube is
a damn good rapper.

6. L1,. Cool J — Mama Said
Knock You Out (Columbia).

OK, I know it’s poppy, but L.L.
kicks hard on this one. “The
Booming System” has to be this
year’s car anthem. It’s a good
follow-up release to 1989’s so-so
“Walking With a Panther."

7. Paris — The Devil Made Me

Do It (Tommy Boy).

This guy came out of nowhere
and sounds like Erik B. and Rakim
but with a different style. One of
1990's most surprising rappers.

8. D-Nice —— Call Me D-Nice
(live/RCA). .

With a little help from KRS-
One and BDP, D-Nice came out
with one of the smoothest releases
of 1990. Check out “Call Me D-
Nice,” “Crumbs on the Table”
and “The TR 808 is Coming.”

9. Monie Love — Down To
Earth (Warner Bros.)

This fine young lady hit America
with full force. Her English style
of rap iswhat captures you. Monie
and Queen Latifah did one of the
most interesting duets of the year
with “Ladies First.” She'll be with
us for years to come.

10. Digital Underground --
Sex Packets (Tommy Boy).

One word can be said about
these guys: Hype. D.U. released
some good singles with “The
Dance” and
“Doowutchyalike, ” but the album
as a whole falls ﬂat at certain
points. However, it’s still good
enough to make the bottom of
the Top 10. Have you noticed

truly a musical amalgam. (He’ll
be in Pittsburgh in February with
Sonic Youth and Social
Distortion.)

-If there’s one band that
avoided the wrath of the Parents’
Music Resource Center, while at
the same time taking vulgarity to
new levels, it’s GWAR. Its music
isn’t astonishingly fresh, but its
on—stage antics with squirting
blood and pornographic lyrics
made the members of GWAR
true censorship warriors in 1990.

-Locally, plenty went on in
1990.’ The Cynics completed a
successful tour of Europe in
support of Rock ‘n ’Roll. (Did you
happen to catch their video on
MTV’s “120 Minutes?”) Bone of
Contention’s 48 Points qf View
made a formidable entrance onto
the local college charts, and local
noise-mongers, the Heretics,
released their second and
unfortunately last album,
Omnivore. (Forgive me for all
the local acts I’ve failed to
mention.)

°Glenn Danzig boasted the
ultimate metal/demonic com-

bination of 1990 with Danzig II.-
Luczfuge and then opted to
release a little Samhain nostalgia
with The Final Decent, which
contains “previously unreleased
material. ” It looks as though Glenn
is trying to milk his legacy for
everything it’s worth.

-The “sell—out” cry has lost
most of its impact; heck, it’s almost
fashionable now. 1990 proved to
be a big year for indie—label bands
to make it into the majors. I guess
the money-hungry powers-that-
be in upper management finally
realized what they were missing.
Sonic Youth released Goo on
Geffen without sacrificing any of
the raw feedback of its previous
Daydream Nation. The
Screaming Trees of Seattle’s Sub
Pop label also scored big with an
EP and an upcoming album on
Epic.

-Henry Rollins took a break
from the macho, ball~bustin g force
of the Rollins Band to dabble in
the industrial/rap/ funk genre with
his pet project, Wartime. lt’s mean
as ever, just a little more melodic
than usual.

the long-awaited sequels to

Show, with their cleverly
concealed titles (The Two fakes

(Jack Nicholson, Cybill Shepherd
and Jeff Bridges) cou1dn’t muster
enough movie-going interest to
pay their horrendous bills.

high—concept packaging:

and Bob Hoskins in Heart

Moore and Daryl Hannah_in Crazy
People; Robin Williams and Tim
Robbins in Cadillac Man; Bill
Cosby in Ghost Dad, and Jim
Varney in Ernest Goes to fail.
Star vehicles also died quickly
with major releases by every
studio: Quick Change (Bill
Murray), Revenge (Kevin
Costner), Stella (Bette Midler),
My Blue Heaven (Steve Martin),
Air America (Mel Gibson),
Grafﬁti Bridge (Prince) and The
Adventures of Ford Fairlane
(Andrew Dice Clay) were released

bymajorstudios but diedquickly
at the box office.
The only saving grace for the
Hollywood coffers was the
Christmas season, which was
once again jam—packed with too
many choices for moviegoers.
Movies like Bonﬁre of the
Vanities, Edward Scissorhands
and TheRussia House are doing
fairly well, but the long-nin gross
proﬁts remain to be seen. (One
movie critic called The Russia
House “cinematic caviar.” In
my opinion, caviar is overpriced
and tastes like shit, so if that’s
Russia House, more power to
you.) These big-budget films
like Godfather, Part III, which
isn’t doing so hot, and Havana

and Mermaids, which are doing
reasonably, have been supplanted
by the smaller films again. Home
Alone remains the true champ for
the holiday season, with over $90
million in projected revenue by
the end of January.

Surprisingly, the biggest films of
the year were the smaller, lower-
budgeted romantic comedies.
Ghost and Pretty Woman were the
highest—grossing films of the year,
earning $180 million and $177
million, respectively. The biggest
surprise hit was, strangely enough,
an independent film from New
Line Cinema called Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, which
grossed $133 million in its first run.

this is hardly an actOr’s showpiece.
We follow Jacob from one bad

And before it’s all Over, we’re

and fact-based reports of drug

Call it Stephen King meets The
Tibetan Boole of the Dead. A real
surprise from Ghost screenwriter
Bruce Joel Rubin. (A bigger
surprise is that it got made in

3. My Left Foot. First a stick-

Beautiful Launderette, then a
smooth super-stud in Unbearable

portray next with total conviction?
This tme story of Christy Brown
is anything but a Rain Man-style
tearjerker. Day—Lewis makes you
feel the gloom, rage and
selﬁshness of an impoverished
young man who can only
communicate through his left foot.
This is a classic “little movie”
which shouldn’t be overlooked.
4.Dances With Wolves. Kevin
Costner’s new-age Western isn’t
just good because it’s politically
correct, it’s good because it’s
visually beautiful and a damn
entertaining adventure story. The
ever-earnest Costner journeys into
the “savage” Sioux culture and
finds it a lot less savage than his
own. The first mainstream ﬁlm to
delve into the lush, mystical
beauty Of 19th century Native
America since Dustin Hoffman’s

Little Big Man.

5. Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!
Must admit I’m surprised how
many women I know love this
story of an ex—con who captures
a porno star and waits for her to
fall in love with him. But then,
what do I know about women?
Spaniard Pedro Alrnodovar keeps
churning Out one zany, sexy ﬁlm
a year. Despite the X rating, this
isn’t as hardcore as Matador or

Labyrinth of Passions: It is

delightful.

6. Glory. An emotionally
overwhelming historical account
of the first black regiment to fight
in the Civil War. Denzel
Washington deserved his Oscar,
but Morgan Freeman and
Matthew Broderick were just as
good. About 10 times as
interesting as Driving MissDaisy.

7. Gremlins II. The little

bu ggers return, this time to invade _

a tycoon’s skyscraper, which
towers Over Manhattan as a tribute
to Reagan— and Bush-era greed
and indecency. I didn’t like the
first Gremlins and generally don't
like this kind of thing. But this
film is so wildly inventive and
satirical that it’s hard to resist.
Among other things, the film
spoofs Donald Trump, other
movies (cuddly Gizmo wears a
Rambo headband and shoots
ﬂaming arrows) and animal
testing. Like the old Warner Bros.
cartoons, this is kiddie pap with
built-in jokes for adults.

8. Henry V. Unknown
Irishman Kenneth Branagh took
the world by surprise with this
adaption of Shakespeare. Branagh
hardly looks like a king, but he
certainly cuts a Cagneyesque
hero’s figure when leading his
army to battle the French. As a
fellow who has been known to

(New World). This orchestra is
more like a big band, although its
sound has little to do with big-
band music. A virtual who's who
of the downtown New York
scene, it plays pieces that range
from loud jazz to more
atmospheric pieces. “Prodigal
 Song Revisited” clips a phrase
' from an old blues song and builds
. it up into something completely

different. Their version of the
’50s pop song “Fever” keeps the
feel of the original song but has
only vague statements of the
melody, using it more as a bridge
for solos. “The Montana Section”
features only reeds and brass,
with the intention of creating the
sound of the wind blowing
through in the ﬁelds of that state
—— and it works. An appropriate
term for these works would be
“ “writes” because of the way they
move and develop.

7. Salem 66 ——' Down the
Primrose Pat/9 (Homestead).
Salem 66’s posthumous last album
just happens to be its best one as
well. Judy Grunwald (guitar) and
Beth Kaplan (bass) are/were
unlike other female songwriters.
The songs on this album are
usually mid—tempo and often
quiet, with guitar playing that
weaves hypnotic melodies
around the vocals. The lyrics are
poetic and haunting. Judy and

0 Beth don’t usually sing about
happy people, but they don’t get
too melodramatic, either. They
draw you into the songs instead
of depressing you. I'll miss this
band.

8. Supercbunle (Matador).
Finally a pop band that was
concerned more with a powerful
recording than a clean one! The
guitars are muddy, and the bass

jounds like a sludgehammer
beating on metal girders, while
the vocals scream in harmony on
top of it all. There haven't been

too many new bands lately that
have the heavy attack of sludge
bands and still manage to write
good pop songs. This young
North Carolina quartet is one of
them.

9. Volcano Suns —-— Thing of
Beauty(SST). Speaking of noisy
pop bands, this goofy Boston trio
pulled off a hard task — putting
together a double album that
rarely slows down throughout all
four sides. Drummer/leader Peter
Prescott handled most of the
songwriting, and after five years
he shows no signs of running out
of ideas. The big surprise, though,
is that guitarist David Klieler and
bassist Bob Weston both
contributed several songs which
are just as loud and powerful as
Prescott’s. And they ended the
album on a quiet note for once.

10. Art Blakey and the Jazz
Messengers — One For All
