Students
question
security

By G, Warren Players
The Pitt News

Security in the William Pitt
Union and use ofthe building’s facil-
ities have become concerns of stu-
dents and staff following last week's

discovery of the body ofa man who
suffered a heart attack in the lower

level lavatory.

Some admit to being concerned
even before the discovery of the
body of Mark Harris, 35, last_Sun-
day afternoon. Harris, campus
police said, was not a Pitt student,
and they are unsure ofwhy he was in
the building.

Sergeant Wa1t"W’aters of campus
police said that because the building
is open to the general public, not just
students, keeping track of the flow
of people is difficult. Waters said
that he has heard no talk of prohibit-
ing non-university people from
using the building.

Students and other staff working
in the union have a similar problem.

“The only time the building is
really secure is at 11 p.m., when all
the ‘doors are locked electronically,"
said an employee who asked t-hathis
name not be disclosed. “A security
guard is then placed at the main
Fifth Avenue entrance to check peo-
ple in and out of the building.”

“I know one female student,.who
also works on campus, and she is

’ afraid to walk to her car at night

after hearing of the dead man.”

Director of Student Activities
Andy Smith said the union should
not be" limited to only students.

“The student union is the one
place where the public is invited
because of the types of activities car-
ried on here,” he said. “If we were to
limit the use of the building to stu-
dents, we would have to ask eve-
ryone who enters to show some type
of identification. It is my belief that
this would produce a very negative
reaction among students and among
alumni we’d like to welcome back.”

Smith added he is confident that
present security systems can address
almost any emergencies that would
arise. L

Smith said Harris could have died
anywhere on campus, in a cafeteria
or in his car. “Anytime someone
dies...those around the victim
become uncomfortable.”

“Since we opened last September,
there have been no murders, armed
robberies, muggings or other acts of
violence against persons in the
union. So, from our perspective, the
building is safe," Smith said.

Pitt freshman Andrew Iezzi, who r

works part-time as a game room
attendant on the union ground
floor, said anyone can come in to
play the video machines and hang

out. .

Inside Today

Now that all the dust and hoopla has settled down
since America’s invasion of Grenada, the island is
revisited through the eyes of Virgin Islander and
Pitt News colunrriist G. Warren Mayers.

By Diane Leikowitz
The  News

How do you prepare for final
exams’?

Do you keep up with classwork all I

semester so, when exam time comes,
all you need are a few hours of
review and a good night's sleep? Or
do you wait to cram l2'weeks of
knowledge into a night or two,
equipped with study tools like caf-
feine pills and instant coffee?

The latter is the method professor
Ron Curran of Pitt's English depart-
ment used until after years of expe-
rience, he changed his study habits.

“In the beginning, I sort‘ of viewed
finals as an ‘end of the world‘ expe-
rience and weighted them with a lot
of pressure they probably didn’t
deserve,” Curran said. “I crammed
and choked. It took a whole bunch
of them to relax that tension."

During this stressful period, when
students turn to everyone from‘
classmates to parents to the pizza

man for advice on how to handle

finals the best ‘people to look

towards for valuable advice might
be those who took years of finals and
lived to tell about them —
professors! ’ _ .
Keeping up with reading and
work throughout the semester seems
to be the name of the game when it
comes to relieving final’s tensions.
“I discovered the best way to pre-

pare for finals was to study early on r

so I could relax the night before
them,” Curran said.

Anthropology professor Arthur
Tuden also took a calm, rational
attitude toward finals.

“Studying for finals was a rela-
tively simple matter,” he said. “I
would try to keep up with the course
and spend at least a day reviewing
each subject.

“I would never study as I see some
of the students here,” he said. “I see
some students studying up to the
morning of the exam. I think that
screws them up more than it helps
them.”

‘On the night before an exam,

Learning to survive finals

Tuden said, he went to a movie or
read a d-etective story.

L Holbert Carroll, a, political
science professor who finished his
undergraduate work in the 1940s,
once had a professor who.said, as a
student, he was always so prepared
he could take a long walk the day
before thefinal.

Carroll himself always made sure
he didn’t get caught in a rut the night
before an exam.

“I happen to be a very disciplined
person, and I was prepared,’ hesaid.
“Of course, students‘ work harder
during examinations. I did, too,
[but] there was less frenzy.

The problems many students have
now, Carroll said, is they don’t exer-
cise discipline and have to cram at
the end of the term. “They should
use the semester to study and review
at the end instead of cram the last 48
hours before the examination,” he
said. ‘ .

That may be sound advice, but
with finals, just around the corner,
students are finding that what began
as the best of intentions in January

Pre-med  
advising
dropped

By Bob Nasslf
and Marty Willis
The Pitt News

In what one advisor termed “a
large mistake," the university's pre-
professional advising office will be
eliminated as of July 31. _

The office, located in room 207,
William Pitt Union, gives advice to
undergraduates on how to apply:to
medical, dental and other profes-
sional schools. After the Spring
Term, however, the jobs of pre-
professional adviser Della Hudson-
Tomlin and secretary Marette
Simpson will be terminated due to
budget cuts in the office of the vice-

‘ chancellor for student affairs, execu-

tive assistant to the vice-chancellor
Robert G. Houston said yesterday.

Barbara Hays, the major adviser
in the department of biological
sciences, said she is very disap-
pointed with the decision to elimi-
nate the office.

“Students deserve this program. I’ '
think that an adequate pre-
professional advising program helps ‘
sell prospective students on Pitt,"
said Hays, a former member of the
pre-professional advising committee
which works with Hudson-Tomlin
to evaluate and issue recommenda-
tions for students. V

Chemistry professor Darel
Straub, one of three faculty
members currently serving on the
committee, said, “The committee
will cease functioning as well. It may
be that the service will no longer be
available, but it may be transferred
to some other area. ,

“Maybe the committee will still be
around for a while, but it will be very
difficult to function without the
adviser or any secretarial help...It’s
still unresolved,” said~Straub, the
committee’s chairman, in a tele-
phone interview yesterday.

Houston explained that the deci-
sion to close the office came from the
office of senior vice-chancellor for
administration Jack Freeman as
part of an ongoing,- relatively rou-
tine budgeting process. It was
entirely unrelated to Provost Roger
Benjamin's recently implemented
university-wide planning process,,he
said.

“None of us are ha-ppy about it, of
course,” Houston said. “We are

, doing it very reluctantly. As you

recall, last year we had to give up the
internship office. Nobody liked
what we had to do, but it did emerge
in another form in the provost’s

office.”

Since the university's internship
office formally closed last year, it
has operated with a staff of one part-

Advisor issue slated
for next board meeting

By Colette Ferris
The Pitt News

The Student Government
Board will reconsider Wednes-
day an Elections Committee
proposal suggesting that the
board, not Pitt’s administration,
select its adviser * after tabling
the issue at Thursday’s meeting.

Board president Ken Stram
saidthe board electedtotablethe
proposal because many board
members still had questions.

Elections Committee chair-
man Jim Brady was surprised
after the board meeting. “What
can I say?” he said. “They tabled

It."

He said he will present the
proposal duringthe next meeting
at 2 p.m. on the 6th floor board
suite in the William Pitt Union.

Brady did point out that the
board is acting on one other
Elections Committee proposal
calling for the appointment of
students to a Student Govern-
ment Judicial Board. Board

_ members began conductingjudi-
cial board interviews following
the meeting. '

In other business, the board
unanimously endorsed the
Governmental Relations Com-
mittee resolution calling for Pitt
vioe—chancellor Jack Freeman to
disclose the list of South African
conrpanies with which the uni-
versity conducts business.

“It's been two weeks sincethey
[Freeman’s office] said they
would disclose the list, and they

‘Its been two i weeks
since they said they
would disclose the list
and they haven ’t yet.’
—-A very Abrams

haven't yet,” board member
Avery Abrams said.

The board also voted to sus-
pend the Student Government
Board bylaws referring to the
need for a student assembly.
Board member and assembly
chairman Jeff Mallinger said he
was unable to organize another
assembly because of“the lack of
interest and lack of time.” Mal-
linger added, however, that a
meeting of the student assembly
will be conducted early in the
fall.

On the heels of reports that
student appointees are failing to
attend University Senate meet-
ings, the board swore in students
who will participate in the meet-
ings. It was the first time in the
history of student government
that students took an oath of
office at the board's weekly pub-
lic meeting.

Board member Bob Kramer,
in charge of the senate appoint-
ments, supported theidea. “Ken
[Stram] thought this would be a
good idea,” he said.

Security
questioned

cominuedfrom page one

“Anyone from the general public
can walk into the game room to play
video games or the jukebox. The
campus police patrol the room once
every night, at least while I’m work-
ing," lezzi said.

“We have no control over who
comes into the game room,” he
explained, “only over student use of
the equipment.” He said students are
required to show a valid ID card if
they want to play pool or use the
room. The room attendant keeps the
card in a plastic file folder until the
student leaves. This ensures that any
damage to the equipment is paid by
the student.

_ lezzi said that if any trouble situa-
tions erupt, he responds by calling
the main desk on the first floor. The
building manager then comes to the
game room or sends a representative
to investigate the matter.

There is only one main entrance to
the game room, but in case of an
emergency, people can exit through
two additional doors located at the
rear ofthe room. One possible draw-
back is that there are no signs to
clearly mark these emergency exits.

Although he said he is not worried
about security in the future, lezzi
admitted the procedure for checking
people in and out of the building is
“neither adequate nor inadequate.”

After the doors are electronically

locked at ll p.m., the building man-
ager goes on a floor-by-floor inspec-
tion to collect the names and reasons
for staying of everyone remaining in
the building after hours. The man-
ager gives the log book to the night
watchman who waits for all those
leaving to sign out.

p‘age*3*

By Catherine Save!
The Pitt News

Few seats were empty Saturday
morning in the Graduate School of
Public Health auditorium where
representatives from both sides of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
shared their views in a panel-
dialogue sponsored by the
Pittsburgh-based chapter of the
New Jewish Agenda and the Ameri-
can Friends Service Committee.

Outside the building, Young
Socialist representatives distributed
leaflets advertising the controversial
film “The Palestinian." The film,
scheduled to be shown March 21 at
the William Pitt Union, was can-
celled due to what the group called
“Zionist pressure” but what Pitt
administrators explained was adver-
tising that_ misrepresented the
group’s identity.

New Jewish Agenda spokesman
Clint Geller said that the literature
being distributed Saturday morning
outside the auditorium had “nothing
to do with the sponsoring organiza-
tions [of the discussion.]”

The chance for dialogue between
the two panelists, Munir Fasheh and
Mordechai Bar-On, was described
by moderator Tom Kerr as an
tunity to hear all views.

Fasheh, a Harvard doctoral can-
didate and past dean of students at
the Firzeit University in the West
Bank, represented the Palestinian
view. Bar-On, a member of the Cen-
tral Council of the Israeli Labor
Party, gave the Israeli side of the
issue. He has also served as a colonel
and an assistant to General Moshe
Dyan.

Both panelists agreed that the
acknowledgement of the right pf
each side to exist is essential if peace
is to be brought to the Middle East.
They both emphasized open dia-
logue as a means of achieving this.

 

‘If you occupy my
home, I don’t care

where you put your
bedroom.’

--Munir F asheh

Bar-On pointed out that people
from both sides of the Palestinian-
Israeli conflict feel “there is no one
on the other side to talk to.” Both
sides go to a third party such as the
U.S. or U.S.S.R. to step in and
mediate the conflict, Bar-On said.

Fasheh said not all outside in-
volvement in internal affairs has
been positive and pointed out the
negative results when other coun-
tries got involved in Third World
matters. a Christian Arab," Fasheh
said. “But I remember missionaries
coming from this country to tell my
mother and father how to be better
Christians.”

He quoted author George Cra- I

mer, who in February, 1948, said
that the United States has only 6
percent of the world’s population
and yet consumes 50 percent of its
resources.

“The American policy has stuck
to that,” Fasheh said. “People
around the world will not accept
that equality for too long.“

Bar-On questioned whether Israel
had accomplished anything by
invading Beruit. Fasheh added that
the Lebanese war has temporarily
distracted the attention of the world
from the conﬂict in the West Bank
and Gaza strip.

“The existence of Palestinians
cannot be denied. Unless their rights
are addressed, the whole world will
be affected,” Fasheh said.

A few weeks ago, Palestinian Lib-
eration Organization (PLO) leader
Yassir Arafat said that Jews are not

ZZZ.

. Dialogue: Solving the conﬂict

people —— they are a religion. Bar-On
said he sees himself culturally and
environmentally as a Jew.

Fasheh expressed his distress with
Western media coverage ofthe Mid-
dle East. For example, the press
ignored when the Palestinian
National Congress met in Algiers
and endorsed a policy recognizing
mutual security of an Israeli and
Palestinian state. “No one [the
press] paid any attention to that.”
Fasheh said. I .

Bar-On said the media have a ten-
dency to misuse language in their
reports. “The use of ‘war’ to make
peace in the Middle East is used
incorrectly."

Bar-On said when two sides are
involved in a dialogue, the side that
speaks of the future is more inter-
ested in peace than the side that con-
stantly talks about history and what
has already been done.

Bar-On admitted he saw the pro-
liferation of settlements in the West

Bank as a major stumbling block to ~

peace in the Middle East.

In an earlier interview, Bar-On
told an American Friends Service
representative that of these settle-
ments,” thirty thousand Israelis now
live in the West Bank and Gaza and
many more in the Jerusalem area.
So a solution will be very painful for
the Israelis, but we must remember
we are talking of even higher stakes
for both the Israelis and the Arab
side.” . V

When asked about the recent
move of the U.S. Embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem, Fasheh said, "If
you occupy my home, I don’t care
where you put your bedroom." Bar-
On, on the other hand, called it a
“bad strategic move.”

Fasheh received applause from‘_

the combined audience ofArabs and
Jews when he said, “We [the Palesti-
nians] are a beautiful people. If a
Jew were to go to one of-our homes,
they [the Palestinians) would invite
you [the Jew] in. They would make
you the best meal.”

Didn’t you know that if you’re a senior with the promise of a $10,000
career-oriented job, you could have the American Express" Card?
Where have you been?

Asleep?

Because for some time American Ex Jress has been sa in that we believe
a O Q 0 o y ’
in your future. But even more than that. We believe in you now. And we ve
been proving it. A $10,000 job. That’s it. No strings. No gimmicks. And this

offer is even good for 12 months after you graduate.

But why do you need the American Express Card now? First of all, it’s a
good way to-begin to establish your credit history. And you know tha't’s
important. Of course, the Card is also good for vacation travel, as well as

for shopping for things like a new stereo

The official student newspaper
of the University of Pittsburgh.

The Pitt News staff.

To Forgive...

The Duquesne Duke published a highly controversial issue
last week as a joke April Fools’ edition. The issue was ﬁlled
with sexual references and obscenities. Duquesne University
has responded by seeking retribution from the editors. The
punishments may include removal from editorial positions and
possibly from the university. Whereas the present editors
showed negligence and poor judgment, the university must
refrain from abusing the paper’s vulnerable position for the
sake of future Duke staff members and readers.

The issue, called The Weekly Douche was amusing, but it
was the cheap, easy way out and didn’t belong in the college's
newspaper. Instead of trying to be really creative, the editors
simply published graphic stories, which showed little
imagination. .

The actions of the present editor will have long-lasting and
detrimental effects on the paper and student body for years to
come.
announced that there will be no April Fools’ edition next year.
The actions by the present editors have handed the Catholic
university the ideal excuse to clamp down on the newspaper. In
their carelessness, the editors have threatened the life of free-
dom of the press at Duquesne.

The editors could have printed the same spoof without uni-
versity funds and not have threatened the independence of
future Duke editors and readers.

College papers are where most professional journalists learn
their craft. The college newspaper is a major part of a journal-
ist’s education. It is a place for experimentation. Students
should be given full leeway to expand their horizons, refine
their skills and enjoy themselves. The Duke went beyond the
limits of good taste, even in the name of fun. It is now an
opportunity for Duquesne’s administration to show its Chris-
tian compassion and turn the other cheek -- to act not with
vengence, but rather, with gentle instruction and trust in its
students. C

That’s Life?

While students at most other colleges and universities return
to their studies and the daily grind after spring break, Pitt
students find themselves in the last few days of the academic
calendar.

Looking past their immediate concerns - finals - students
will consider a summer of good times, tough decisions and
work ahead of them. For one group of students, graduating
seniors, the next few weeks will usher in the biggest transition
of their young lives.

What these seniors may be surprised to discover is how little
the lessons of the past four (for some longer) years at ‘Pitt apply
to a 40-hour week with too little pay and an overabundance of
aggravation. While many have eased that transition with
internships or part-time employment in their field of interest,
the majority will be forced to learn on their feet much of which,
although not available in the formal structures of a university,
can nevertheless be learned during the course of an undergrad-
uate’s study. »

While America stiffens over the declining quality of the
educational systems, undergraduates at schools such as Pitt
ought to remind themselves that life has never been completely
or adequately encapsulated in the chapter of a book or an entire
course of study. '

So Pitt undergraduates might take the time, before they find
themselves a weekaway from graduation, to open their minds
to the education provided to us beyond the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. Economics major could do themselves a favor by walking
through Pittsburgh’s strip district one early morning and talk-
ing with a produce supplier. Social work majors might volun-
teer their time to the Ozanam Center one day a week.

Graduation memories ought to be composed of more than a
crowded transcript and stolen beer mugs from Peter‘s Pub or
the Sanctuary. Life is here for the asking, and you won‘t be
charged by the cashiers office for the credits you earn.

Letters To The Editor

  Pitt’s Campus

Cops Keystone
comedians

I had to chuckle out loud when I
came upon a copy of your March 14
issue at a fast food store in Oakland
and saw the article on the front page

about the Pitt campus cops trying to
get the Fraternal Order, of Police as
its bargaining representative to the
university administration.

The Pitt campus cops fancy them-
selves as “real” police, just like the
Pittsburgh city police force. How-
ever, l.don’t see how any reasonable
person can take the Pitt campus
cops seriously.

Infractions that would result in
the suspension or even firing of a city
policeman will be hushed up and
swept under the rug, as it were, by
the university administration when
committed by campus cops.

I don’t think that the Pitt campus
cops deserve to be called “police.”
They should be called just “security

An education
brings

responsibility

It is now the end of another aca-
demic year, and what have we done?
Another year wiser; another year

older? Are there any accomplish-C

ments to look back on (not just
another 30 credits or a new lover)?

, For weeks now, these authors have

been calling for students to go
beyond matriculation and its partic-
ulars. lt has been said the students in

today’s colleges are apathetic, that

they don’t care about anything but
themselves. Maybe the “Me Genera-
tion" never ended.

In the future, if events or your life
aren‘t what’ you want them to be,
and if you have done nothing, you
deserve what you get. You worked
hard for it, here in college! If your
sons or you go to war —- well, you
had a chance to do something. lfthe
country hits another depression, you
had the chance to do something new
when the problem could have been
addressed. Later will be too late.

One thing can becounted on to

endure and continue, even if today’s
generation refuses to be vigilant for

all of us: Walden. It will always be‘

here as a conscience for the people.
It remains, poking, prodding and
chiding people to get up and be
accountable for what they have
created and create. This responsibil-
ity cannot be escaped. _
Rome fell through general apathy

(along with the marauding hordes of_.

Visigoths ' and Barners). It can
happen again. The excuse “It can’t
—- or won’t — happen here”just isn’t
true without constant vigilance. Ask
the Jews who survived the Holo-
caust or the Cambodians who sur-
vived Pol Pot or any of the other
survivors of one of the many acts of
genocide or societal collapse. It
happens; even today, even here!"

We haven’t gotten much smarter
as a people; we still repeat the same
old mistakes. But mistakes are not
deterministic-; the future is to be
made not retried or rolled over.

So let us feel hope and feel the
sunrise in our minds.

Thank you,
The Walden Staff
A peak in a
utilitarian’s
rnental revolt

What motivates man? Is it to go
through life being the best person he
can possibly be? To be a charitable

and compassionate person and to

perform good deeds and help his fel-
low man? Yes, these could possibly
be the superficial motives of man,
but what is the driving force behind
all these ideals? What moves man to
do good deeds or help his fellow col-
leagues? Fear. This is the single
motive behind every act, good or
bad that man achieves.s.

Every action man performs is
done by fear. Who go to school? To
get a job and make a lot of money.
Security —— with money one avoids
being poor. This fear of being poor
drives people to do well in school
and possibly to take courses that are
not their main interests but that
offer more security. This is happen-
ing in today’s colleges; more people
are enrolling in the sciences and
staying away from the fine arts.

Why be kind to your fellow man?
Instead of helping a man who
dropped a stack of papers on the
floor, why not kick them all over the
room? Why should one be moral?
Although this has been a question
that has plagued mankind for thou-
sands of years, one possible answer
could be fear of the afterlife. In the
most basic form. religions state that

.,.. .,, .., . .,...... ..   . . , .   ,, , W ., .., ., .,,,_...

after life as we know it, there is an

eternal afterlife. Those who have
made all the correct decisions will go
to an everlasting life of goodness,

while the others who have made the

wrong ‘moral decisions go to an af-
terlife of perpetual pain and suffer-
ing. The fear of this everlasting
suffering could make man be kind
to his fellow man and try to make the
correct decisions.

Why does the seventh grader
smoke a cigarette after his,class-
mates called him a coward for not
doing it‘? Fear of not being accepted,
fear of individuality. If everyone
does it, it must be all right. It is the
different one, the one who stands
alone, at whom the people point and
ridicule. Fear of being the one
pointed at and not the one pointing
makes mankind one general cate-
gory: people, not persons.

These are a few ways in which fear
motivates man. There are many
more. The next time you decide to

do something, think why you’re'

going to do it. Maybe you will draw
the same conclusions I have.

One last call
for fairness

It was very discouraging to read.

about a “debate going on between
proponents of heterosexuality and
homosexuality,” as so worded in the
article found in March 26 issue of
The Pitt News. This might not have
been so disturbing if it weren't for
the fact that many people —— both
homosexual and heterosexual - do
approach this issue in this way. I find
it hard to grasp the idea of there
being “proponents" of sleep, food or
laughter? These, like sexual tenden-
cies, are examples of natural human
behavior.

The point to which I am leading is
that it is senseless to fight a battle in
which there will be no winners. Ever-
yone will lose in this battle. Why?
Because this is the wrong battle!
What need to be fought against are
attitudes — attitudes that hurt peo-
ple, attitudes that stifle human
potential

As long as there will be people,
there will be homosexuals and heter-
osexuals. People of both natures
must learn to accept each other --
not fight each other.

From where I stand/G. Warren Mayers

America should practice what shepreaches

While presidential counsellor
Edwin Meese defends his integrity
and “loses" his memory on Capitol
Hill, the memory of U.S. forces
storming the beaches on the island
of Grenada is still painfully alive.
That action by the Reagan adminis-
tration; preceded by the Thatcher
government’s war against the people
of the Falkland Islands, has not as
yet been justified by the measuring
stick of social or moral ethical stan-
dards, standards that purportedly
are upheld by the International
Court of Justice at The Hague. And

contrary to the Geneva Conven-
tions, both actions were undeclared
wars.

Public opinion polls conducted
after these events allegedly showed
that “a majority of those polled sup-
ported the action” oftheir respective
governments. However, closer
examination of the official reason
for America's intervention in Gren-
ada paints another picture. Not eve-
ryone agrees with Reagan that
“American lives were in danger."
Keep in ‘nind that Lyndon Johnson
used this very reason for sending

Marines intothe Dominican Repub-
lic in 1965."

Let the record show that for at
least two years preceding the
October 25, I983, assault by com-
bined U.S.-Caribbean forces, many
Grenadians spoke openly ofa possi-
ble invasion. In several speeches,
Prime Minister Maurice Bishop
warned his people ofthat possibility.
The Washington Post reported on
Feb.27, 1983, “The CIA developed
plans in the summer of I981 to cause
economic difficulty for Grenada in
hope of undermining the political

Cutting government’s credit

A man went to his employer's
office and asked if he could have a
minute with him.

“What’s the problem?” asked‘ the
boss. .

“I need a raise."

The boss raised an eyebrow. “But.
you just got one.”

“It wasn’t enough. My bills are
still bigger than my paycheck.”

“It sounds like you’ve been foolish
with your money.”

“I admit it, but now I’m a bad
credit risk, and it’s either a raise or
the loan sharks.”

“I’m sorry to hear that,” said the
boss, “but I can’t give you a raisejust
because you need the money. I can
only give raises to people who earn

them. And with your spending hab-
its, a raise for you would be a bad
investment.”

“But you‘re only thinking of
yourself!”

“That’s true. That’s how I got to
be your‘boss. And if you had done a
better johfof -looking out for your-
self,’ yb.11‘wouldn't be in this mess.”

“Then there’s nothing you’ll do to
help me?”

“I didn’t say that," said the boss.
He pulled a pair of scissors from his
desk drawer and said, “Hand me
your credit cards.”

Judging from the columns and let-
ters I‘ve read in this paper, I guess
most of you would not only sympa-
thize wilth the worker, but criticize

his “greedy" boss for being so “self-
ish". So would Gary Hart, Walter

‘ Mondale and, in his own way, Presi-

dent Reagan, for each of these politi-
cians want their “employer” -

namely you -—- to give them a “raise”

in the form of higher taxes to help
relieve the government’s huge defi-
cits. (I’m alarmed that so many of
you agree; perhaps we have lost so
much freedom to the Welfare State
that many think that citizens are
obligated to work for the govern-
ment, instead of the other way
around.)

It may sound strange to hear Rea-
gan put in the same class as his
rivals, but when if comes to the

control of.'..Bishop.”

The facts are undeniable. Bishop
angered the Reagan administration
by repeated speeches criticizing U.S.
foreign policy, by openly soliciting
economic aid from Cuba and, by his
support of the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. In what regard were
these actions “a threat to American
lives”? The medical students who
kissed the ground upon their return
to the United States gave thanks for
their “deliverance." A carefully
rehearsed and staged media event if
ever there was one! Why were so
many eager to return to Grenada?

The Reagan administration suc-
cessfully closed out the media to per-
tinent information in the early stages
of the assault. Reagan was then able

to justify this move as done “in the
interest of national security.” This
reason lacks authenticity in the
Grenada situation. Also, the idea
that “Cuba was building asuper run-
way on the island for future attack
against the United States,” is pat-
ently ridiculous!

The administration also argued
that the invasion was conducted at
the behest of the Organization of

Eastern Caribbean States. This
argument leaks worse than a sieve!
Over 200 Marines were sitting ducks
for a Beirut bloodbath, and the Uni-
ted States responds by withdrawing

‘ its forces to a “safe distance” at sea.

The Polish government brutally
crushes Solidarity and “America
responds with ecomonic sanctions.
However, in the ﬁnal analysis, the
communists are triumphant.

When the Soviet Union invades
Afghanistan, there is a howl of pro-

test. coupled with threats of sanc-
tions, from the White House. The
hoopla has died down, the Soviet
Army is still entrenched in that
country. The pro-American govern-
ment of the shah is overthrown by
revolution and Americans are taken
hostage. The United States commits
one of the worse blunders in recent’
military history, and the hostages
are held in a game of international
blackmail. In the face of these
events, was America simply thirsty
for a military victory?

Finally, no evidence has surfaced
that the pro-Marxist government of
Bishop posed a direct threat to any
other Caribbean nation. Bishop was
tremendously popular among his
own countrymen, in spite of reports
in the Western press to the contrary.
Meanwhile, former Grenadian
prime minister Eric Gairy, under
whose rule the island suffered eco-
nomic devastation, now lives in the
United States undera 1979 grant of
political asylum. Recent reports
have stated that “things are back to
normal” on Grenada, meaning that
Grenada has once again become a
part of the tropical playground of
rich jet-setters. But the most promis-
ing report of all was the announce-
ment that the murderers of Maurice
Bishop have been arrested and will

‘stand trial. The Reagan administra-

tion should also be put on trial for
exporting war into the usually tran-
quil Caribbean. Whether or not they
acted to “protect American lives” or
at the “invitation” of others is a mat-
ter a jury of their peers should
decide. For this, after all, is a corner-
stone of American jurisprudence.

For responsible government, cut their credit line

continued from page ﬁve

government’s income, his only quib-
bles with the liberals are how to raise
the money and what to name the
method of raising it. Although he
spoke of the prosperity cutting our
income taxes would bring, he turned
right around and increased the
Social Security and gasoline taxes
and plugged up a number of “loop-
holes,” all to fill up federal coffers
with still more money that we, not
the government, earned.

I doubt that anyone could make a
convincing argument for giving the
government a raise. There has been
wasteful spending in both social and
defense programs. If a private indi-
vidual were to run a retirement plan,
a health insurance plan or an invest-
ment firm the way the government
runs Social Security, Medicare or

“savings” bonds, that person would
be arrested and convicted for fraud.
And while many who voted for Rea-
gan really believe in restoring our
military capabilities to full strength,
running up a defense bill that even
hawks like Barry Goldwater call lu-
dicrous is not what they had in mind.

Oneironic aspect of all this is that
when any serious budget cutting
takes place, one of the first victims is
the only program that ever brought
a return, let alone broke even. Every
billion dollars that are invested in
the exploration and commercializa-
tion of space creates some 800,000
jobs, increases the gross national
product by $23 billion and lowers
inflation by at least one percent. But
if you remember the ﬂap over Rea-
gan’s proposal to spend $8 billion
over the next ten years to build a

space station, try dividing $8 billion
by ten and then divide the result by
$300 billion (next year’s budget
rounded down to the nearest
hundred billion), and see for your-
self how silly it is to say that cutting
back on space will help cut deﬁcits,
lower unemployment, and fight
inflation in a big way. (The answer is

0.0008889 —- that‘s the percentage

that has the anti-technology people
up in arms!)

The real sources of our govern-
ment’s deficits are the social pro-
grams, which do not help the “truly
needy," and the defense expendi-
tures, not all of which provide any
real defense. I’m not against the

good intentions which inspired these‘

programs; they appear in the Consti-
tution itself. But we should take a
closer look at what we’re getting

from our “employee” in return for
that whopping salary we’re paying;
moreover, we should start question-
ing the motives ofthose who want us
to cough up still more to pay the hills
which they ran up. Those who say
that tax cuts help the “rich” obscure
the fact that tax hikes hurt the
“poor" and working classes most.
(Keep this in mind when a million-
aire who is running for president
calls for tax increases.)

Our “employee,” like the one in
the story above, also has a “loan
shark” to invoke — its name is inﬂa-
tion. As the laws of supply and
demand tell us, inﬂation occurs
whenever there is a large supply of
money and a shortage of goods.
Most liberals and socialists will
blame the shortage on the “greedy
capitalists,” while conservatives will

STARTS FRIDAY AT THEATRES EVERYWHERE

J

either blame the“greedy workers" or
in more lucid moments, point out
how regulations, taxes and other
forms of government interference
keep production down. Only on the
rarest occasions will any one ques-
tion the government’s constant
increasing of the money supply.

So before you vote for someone
who will increase taxes, ask yourself
if your “employee” really deserves
that “raise.” Don’t be afraid to be a
good boss and be ‘‘selfish‘’; your
altruism could result in a society
where Izods cost fifty dollars, Volks-
wagens go for $20,000, your siblings
will pay $250 a credit to go to Pitt,
and, ifyou find ajob, you won’t have
two pennies to rub together after
taxes. —

Football team aids library fund

A Panther football tradition of donating money to Pitt’s
libraries was begun in I976 and has now reached an amount
totaling $350,000. Following the national championship Sugar
Bowl in l977, the team donated $l00,000 ofthe net proceeds to
the various librarieson campus and gave $25,000 after partici-
pating in last year’s Fiesta Bowl.

Edward Bozik, director of Pitt athletics, said, “The dona-
tions have been well received by the university and are a fitting
way to show the team’s success. We recognize that education is
preeminent [at Pitt]."

Pitt grad appointed to state board

Jeanne W. McKelvey, a 1967 Pitt graduate with a B.S. in
medical technology, has been appointed by Governor Richard
Thornburgh to the State Board of Medical Education and
Licensure. The board, which totals 10 members, is made up of
five physicians, one representative of the Department of
Health, the Secretary of the Bureau of Occupational Affairs

’ and three members of the public. McKelvey has been

appointed to the last category.

Pitt prof receives fellowship award

Dr. John W. Williams, a professor of fine arts, was one of
several hundred nation-wide recipients ofthe 1984 John Simon
Guggenheim Fellowship Award. The award honors scholars,
scientists and artists who have demonstrated acomplishments
in their field in the past and show strong promise for the future.
Of the 3,542 applicants this year, 283 were selected, with 16

‘Student Rafe With I.D.

By Lisa Keer
The Pitt News

in the continuing battle against
abuse of wildlife and laboratory
animals. demonstrators are prepar-
ing to rally this month in Los
Angeles, Washington, D.C. and at
Pitt’s campus, hoping that their voi-
ces will be heard on the national
level.

Dan Kinney, co-chairman of the
Pittsburgh chapter of Mobilization
for Animals, estimates that 5,000
people will attend the Washington
rally, and said he believes the Pitt
rally can be just as successful.

“If one hundred people will travel

. to Washington on April 7, an equal

number will travel across town on
April 24,” Kinney said.

      

Kinney cited cuttingoffallforeign
animal fur importation into the Uni-
ted States and ending the use of
spring-released leg hold traps to cap-
ture wild animals as the two main
issues to be addressed at the
Washington and Los Angeles rallies.

To build support for the two
issues, Kinney said, local involve-
ment has consisted of letter-writing
campaigns in favor of House Bill
1797. which seeks to impose a
national ban on leg hold traps, and
picketing in front of fur distributors
on a yearly basis. However, the pick-
eting is now being planned as a bi-
weekly event.

So far, New Jersey and Rhode
lsland are the only states which have
laws prohibiting the use of the leg
traps.

The Pitt demonstration will take
place on April 24, with activities

Pre-profession
advising office
to be dropped

cominuedfrom page one
time graduate assistant in the pro-
vost’s office.

Could the pre-professional advis-
ing services now provided by
Hudson-Tomlin and committee
members Straub, physics professor
John Townsend and psychology
professor David Wood reappear
next fall in another part of the
university?

“That's a possibility," Straub
acknowledged. He said he sent a let-
ter written by his committee to Irwin
Schulman, dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences, on Friday.

The letter asked Schulman to con-
sider the idea of transferring the
advising of pre-professional stu-
dents to the CAS advising center on
the 9th floor of the Cathedral of
Learning, Straub sa'd, adding, “I
don’t know what Dean Schulman
will say.”
~ Houston noted that this type of
specialized advising benefits only
those students who apply to medical
and other professional schools and
that most undergraduates at Pitt will
be unaffected by this decision.

“I view this as a subprogram ser-
vicing a very important population,
but not a sizeable population, com-
paratively,” he said.

One Pitt senior majoring in chem-
istry, who asked not to be identified,
said he is applying to medical school
but considers the elimination of the
office “no big deal at all.” A student
who uses the office's evaluation ser-
vice and is recommended “less than
fully” for medical school is in a
weaker position than one who does
not use the office, he said.

“I just don’t like the system
because if Pitt doesn’t recommend
you fully, then the medical schools
won’t even look at your applica-
tion,” he said.

Scott Haluska is a Pitt junior
majoring in biological sciences who
made good use of the office to help
him apply to Pitt’s School of Dentis-
try, which recently accepted him for
next fall on an early admissions
basis. When informed of the deci-
sion to eliminate Hudson-Tomlin’s
position as pre-professional advisor,
Haluska responded, “She was just
hired in January! And now they
want to 'eliminate the office? I find
that really strange."

Without a pre-professional advis-
ing office, Haluska predicted, the
brunt of the necessary advising will
fall on adivisers in the chemistry,
biological science and other
departments.

Physics professor Townsend
warned of one possible drawback to
an advising system limited to indi-
vidual departments. “We’re going to
end up with fewer students who
know what is required of them."

Learning to survive finals

has amounted to a familiar situation
—- having to learn a whole semester’s
information in a few days.

The problem these students have
is handling the situation while keep-
ing sane and getting a passing grade.

According to Dr. Warren Hill of
the Counseling Center, the best way
to help fellow students cope with
fears of finals is to be there for
support.

“Sometimes it’s hard for a student
to find a sympathetic ear," he said.
“Often the parents, not having gone
to college themselves, don’t under-
stand what the student is going
through.”

What the_ student is going
through, Hill said, is a very stressful
period in which all aspects oflife can
be affected.

“In anybody’s life, one stress
always relates to another stress," he
said. “For example, one person may
not be able to spend as much time
with her boyfriend, and the boy-
friend may not understand this. It
causes tensions.”

Hill advises students to pace

themselves and remember that it’s
only a temporary situation. Stu-
dents should remind themselves how
happy they’ll be when finals are
over, he said.

This advice was repeated by
Simone Myers, a junior pharmacy
student.

“Youjust have to look forward to
the day when they‘re all over and
remember this is the final push," she
said.

Her own study habits include tak-
ing exams one at a time and concen-
trating on one test only after the
preceding tests are over.

“I try to think about nothing else
but the final,” she said. “l’Il have
time after the final to think about
other things.”

Sophomore Keith Tuttle, a studio
arts major, keeps up with his work
all year and tries not to lose much
sleep over exams.

“I usually don’t stay awake to
study,” he said. “I study during the
daytime and get normal sleeping
hours. It’s a lot when you have to
study for like five finals in three
days.”

Engineering major Bill'Baker. a
junior, also doesn’t lose much sleep
over final exams, but he admits he
isn‘t always quite as prepared as he
should be.

“I refuse to take a final on no
sleep. I learned my lesson about
that," he said. “I always just get it
done underneath the wire. All engi-
neers get it done under the wire,
except the nerds who getgit done a
week in advance."

Lisa Kathryn Johnson, a sopho-
more writing major, said she handles
finals “poorly” and has some regu-
lar, effective study habits.

“I eat lot of pizza," she said.

What motivates Johnson to
study?

“Fear of what my mother is going
to do when I get home and she opens
that grade report and sees disaster,”
she said.

Sophomore Eric Miller also has
some study patterns he tries to fol-
low on a regular basis.

“I blow them off and party," he
said. “I cram the night before. It

works every term.”

New career tool

Transcripts can make a difference

By Lisa B. Keer
The Pitt News

There is onemore way Pitt stu-
dents can catch the eye of_.pros,pec—
tive employers this summer, but not
all employers are impressed.

An official transcript recording a
student's extra-curricular activities
during his college career is available
for a fee of $4. “We’1l have to raise it
to between $6 and $7 for the next
printing,” said" Joyce Giangarlo,
assistant director of the Office of
Student Activities.

“The smart student will use it as a
tool,” said Giangarlo.

For the past five years, the Office
of Student Activities has organized
the Emerging Leader program
offered to freshman and the retreats
for other student organizations. The
transcript was the next logical step,
Giangarlo said. The idea was
initiated in September l98l.

Once a student has applied for a
transcript, he receives a booklet
explaining the program and provid-

ing the necessary forms to be com-
pleted. The forms are then signed by

the organization's adviser, provid-
ing the validation.

Giangarlo said she checks those
submissions signed by advisers she
does not recognize, “I have never
had a problem with integrity,” she
said.

The students’ activities are classi-
fied into four categories: leadership,
professional or educational develop-
ment, honors and awards and par-
ticipation. Employment experience
is not eligible for inclusion, she said.

Giangarlo expects many juniors
and seniors to apply for the pro-
gram, she said, because “they are
conscious that they will graduate.”

Maxine O’Donnell, employment
manager for Kaufmann’s depart-
ment store downtown, said she
would welcome the transcript,
although “most students are forth-
right and honorable.” She has rarely
encountered prospective employees
who have lied about their extra-
curricular activities, she added.

David Kearney, regional recruit-
ing supervisor for Westinghouse,
agreed with O’Donnell. He said it is
especially good to highlight leader-
ship roles, and the transcript does

this.
A spokesman for Mellon Bank,
who asked not be identified, said it

i does not make a difference.

“We don’t really pay attention to
these things," the spokesman said.
“it is Mellon Bank’s policy to verify

graduation dates, degrees and insti—.

tutions attended. The transcript
wouldn’t be particularly helpful."

. None of the employers contacted
said they had ever seen anything
resembling the transcript. Giangarlo

b said Pitt got the idea from the Com-

munity College
County.

The Universities of Minnesota,
Nebraska and Texas at Austin have
similar programs. The closest area
school with such a program is Hiram
College in Ohio, she said.

Giangarlo added that the tran-

of Allegheny

"script offers an opportunity for the

student to “pat himself on the back"
and for the Office of Student Activi-
ties staffto “use their abilities as edu-
cators rather than just as staff.”
Since the end of February, 5,000
mailings were sent to juniors and
seniors, Giangarlo said. To date,
over 750 students have enrolled in
the program. ' .. 2

Natural parents keep tabs

By Ron Smutny
The Pitt News

When parents give up a child for
adoption, it is generally assumed
that they are also giving up all ties to
the child forever. There is a national
group, however, that believes it does
not have to be this way.

Concerned United Birthparents
Inc., based in Dover, New Hamp-
shire, is a non-profit organization
advocating the rights of birthpar-
ents, the child’s natural parents. The
group’s efforts will be highlighted
this week in the nation’s first annual
Birthparents Week.

The week provides everyone with
an opportunity to offer support and
understanding to parents who are
separated from their children
because of adoption, according to
Sharon Rocca, a spokesman for the
group. ‘

During the week, the group plans
to encourage adoptive parents to
update the information agencies
keep on them because many birth-
parents like to inquire about the
child’s progress with his new par-
ents. If they do so, the birthparents"
will not feel totally excluded from
the child’s life, according to Rocca.
Such information sharing can work
the other way as well, such as when
the adoptive parents need informa-
tion about the child from his natural
parents.

New bills and programs now
being drawn up at the state and fed-
eral levels promote the complete

separation of families through adop-

tion. Rocca said, however, that
society is unaware of the pain felt by
many birthparents who are perman-
ently separated from their children.

“Our research confirmsthat the
grief of having children missing in
adoption can negatively affect birth-

chologist and Concerned United
Birthparents president.

Basically, the organization serves
as a support group for mutual
understanding and friendship for
birthparents, according to Camp-
bell. In addition, its national new-
sletter provides members with
solutions to problems and points of
view from other birthparents’as well
as adoption-related information.

The Pittsburgh chapter offers

birthparents under the coordination

passing vears do not lessen the inten-

“What we want people to do is

the birthparents make,” Harsch
said.

A college fraternity is a
select group of‘men with
similar ideals, hopes, and
purposes bonded together
by deep friendship and mut-
ual understanding. Such. a
bond furnishes the indis-
pensible incentive which
turns the college youth into
the poised and self-
confident man equipped
with a keener mind, a
greater appreciation, and
broader sympathies, and
fortified by a group of true
and understanding friends
which will abide through
life.

The American college
fraternity is one of the few
institutions in our higher
educational structure
which was invented by us
and not borrowed from
European models. Not sur—'
prisingly, it has been a sym-
bol of American college

1984 GREEK WEEK RESULTS

Greek Week 1984 consisted
of many events in which sor-
orities and fraternities partici-
pated in. For some of the
events, the fraternities and
sororities were ’matched
together. For other events,
each fraternity and sorority
competed individually.

Fun and Games night was

one of the first events of

Greek Week. Each matched
group competed in many
events such as tug of war,
apple bobbing, musical chairs
and Simon Says. The winners
of Fun and Games were: Delta
Tau Delta, Chi Omega, Delta
Phi, Delta Phi Epsilon and
Sigma Chi, first place; Lambda
Chi Alpha, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Pi Lambda Phi, and Pi
Kappa Phi, second place.
Each .matched group
designed a banner displaying

the logo, the sponsors’ name
and the names of their groups.
The banners were displayed at
Fun and Games and at the
Dance Marathon. The
winners of the banner compe-
tition were: First place Delta
Tau Delta, Chi Omega, Delta

Phi‘, Delta Phi Epsilon and_

Sigma Chi; and second place
Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Alpha Epsilon
Phi, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa
Theta, and Zeta Beta Tau.
The chariot race was based
on two criteria: apperance of
the chariot, worth 60%, and
the actual race, worth 40%.
Each matched group con-
structed a chariot out of any-
thing they wanted. The
winners were: Kappa Alpha
Theta, Sigma Phi Epsilon’,
Alpha Epsilon Phi, Phi Kappa
Theta, and Zeta Beta Tau;

ternities, Sigma Phi Epsilon
was first, Delta Tau Delta was

Greek Sing has traditionally
been a highlight of Greek
Week. Each sorority and fra-
ternity spend a lot of time and
effort into choosing their
songs and choreography and
perfecting their acts. The
winners were Delta Phi
Epsilon, first; Delta Delta
Delta, second; and Delta Zeta,
third for the sororities. For the
fraternities, Phi Gamma Delta
took first place for the fifth
year in a row; Delta Tau Delta,
second and Delta Phi, third.

the Dance-a—thon had to have
a minimum of $100 from a

W35

sponsor and compete at least

16 hours of dancing. Over
$18,000 was collected during

‘ the twenty-four» hours. The

winners were based on which
group collected the most
money. Chi Omega was first;

Delta Zeta, second and Delta
Delta Delta, third for sorori-
ties. Delta Tau Delta was first,
Sigm Phi Epsilon, second and
Delta Phi, third for the

points that each sorority and
fraternity accumulated from
every event. The winners for
the sororities were Chi
Omega, first; Delta Delta
Delta and Delta Phi Epsilon,
tied for second. The ‘winners
for. thefraternities were Delta
Tau Delta, first; Sigma Phi

Chi Omega and _Sal Leto of
Delta Phi were found to be the
most deserving.

GREETINGS FROM...

Panhel and IFC had a very
busy Winter Term. This
semester was the first time
that sorority leaders partici-
pated in President's Weekend.
Not only was this a great
learning experience for those
who attended, but it was also a
lot of fun.

Following the retreat,
members of the Panhel Exec
Board and IFC Exec Board
attended the Northeastern
Panhellenic Conference/Nor-
theastern Interfraternity
Council Convention in Phila-
delphia. We had the opportun-
ity to learn about ways to
improve the Greek system and
compare notes about Panhel
and IFC with other universi-
ties across the country.
Melinda Smith, Panhel Exter-
nal Vice President, was elected
as our Area IV Vice President.
I had the opportunity to serve
on the NEPC nominating com-
mittee which reviewed all the
candidates for NEPC ‘Presi-
dent and the Executive Secre-
tary and devised a slate. The
conference was beneficial to all
the board members present
and Pitt's Greek system.
Bridget Guernsey, our Greek

-Advisorﬁdeserves a special

thanks for all the spirit she had
throughout the convention.
Soon after we were back,

Greek Week began. All the
sororities who participated did
a great job. Special thanks to
IFC and Panhel Greek Week
Chairmen and The Family
House for helping to make
Greek Week such a successful
event.

At Greek Week Talent
Night, members were tapped
into Rho Lambda which is part
of the Panhel system,,again
due to the two remaining
members Jean Sterling and
Bridget Guernsey. Rho
Lambda is the Panhel honor-
ary for Greek leaders who are
Juniors and Seniors. Over
thirty new members were
initiated and a new executive
board was recently elected.

George Zdravecky, IFC
Rush Chairman and Laura
Ferlan, Panhel Internal Vice
President have a lot of great
plans for Fall Rush. Not only is
Rush going to be in a short
time period, but there are also
some great PR plans to get
people interested. The Rush
Committee Chairman, Rush
Counselors and sororities and
fraternities are looking for-
ward to a successful‘Fall Rush.

PanhellIFC have a lot of‘

plans for Fall Semester start-
ing off with the Greek Greet-
ers Program organized by
Michelle Anderson, Panhel

External Activities Chairman.
This program involves Greeks
helping freshmen to move into
the dorms to introduce them
to Pitt and the Greek system.

Panhel/IFC wish the best of
luck to Bob’ Sevcik. We know

he will do a great job as IFC

President next term. We wish
the best of luck to Rick Pollock
when he goes to TEMPLE den-
tal school next year.

__ We hope everyone has a
happy and healthy summer
break. Make the best of every
minute because itseems to go
by so quickly. We would like to
extend a special thanks to
Melinda Smith, Suzanne Lang,
and Patrick'Good for getting
the OLYMPIA published. It is
a publication that has been
long awaited and will hope-
fully maintain a tradition for
Pitt Greeks. You did a great
job!

Once again, have a great
summer!

Fraternally yours,

Lousie Marshall
Panhellenic President

John O'Connor
IFC External Vice

President

In the Inter-Fraternity
Council Intramural Sports
program, there was once
again great rivalry among
the fraternities in compet-
ing for various sports cham-
pionships. Throughout the
fall and winter terms all
who participated showed
outstanding athletic ability
and commendable sports-
manship in making the

1983-1984 sports year a
success. The following were
the team winners of the

emphasizes scholarship. It
is only through these varied
interests that a sorority can
benefit and become a
whole.

The members of a soror-

strong bond of love and
acceptance. Through this
close relationship with oth-
ers, a girl will reach a fuller
development of her own
character.

What is a sorority? It is
‘the most worthwhile and
rewarding group to which
one could belong.

Scurry admits drug abuse

Relief pitcher Rod Scurry was placed on the inactive list after
conceding to a dependency on drugs. although not specifying which
type. Don Robinson brought the problem to manager Chuck Tanner‘s
attention Saturday morning, but Scurry sought advice from Execu-
tive Vice President Pete Peterson a short time later.

‘‘I’m happy he’s going to get this thing straightened out,“ said Tanner.
“This is just a bunt. I’m certain hell come back and hit a home run.”

Sox suffer Morris’ magic

1 Jack Morris pitched a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox
Saturday to keep Detroit’s record free of losses (5-0). Morris is 2-0
thus far in this young season, but there were a few instances when the
no-hitter was in jeopardy. Tiger manager Sparky Anderson inserted
Dave Bergman at first base in the seventh inning, correctly anticipat-
ing Bergman’s defensive ability. The firstbaseman snared two line
drives in that inning to preserve the rare accomplishment.

The World champion Baltimore Orioles are keeping a firm grip
on last place in the American League East, and weretwice subdued by
the Minnesota Twins over the weekend. Yesterday, it was Minnesota
7, Baltimore 3, but Saturday’s embarassment tells the story more
accurately. The Orioles (0-4) were subjected to a 13-4 defeat paced by
homeruns from Twins Tim Teufel, Tim Laudner, and Lenny Faedof

The Pitt News, Monday, April 9, 1984

By Jim Pietras
The Pitt News

Yesterday was a day of evening

the score for the Pitt men‘s tennis
team. The Panthers evened their
record at 7-7 with victories over St.
Vincent’s College and Carnegie-
Mellon University.

The Panthers played an early 9
a.m. match at Trees courts, but it
didn’t seem to affect their play as
they won easily, 9-0, over St. Vin-
cent’s. Only the first doubles team of
Dave Johnson-Larry Lederer had to
go to three sets, beating the Tom
Helisak-Mark Silko team, 4-6, 6-0,
6-1.

“St. Vincent’s weren’t as strong as
we expected,” said Panther head
coach George Dieffenbach.

The afternoon match, however,
was quite a different story.

The Tartans of CMU provided a
lot more competition than expected,
as the Panthers beat them at CMU
6-3. It was even closer than the score
indicates, as two matches went three
sets and the victory was still not
assured after singles competition
was completed.

The first four seeds for Pitt won,
but CMU’s Bhaskar Thapa beat
Kevin Lash 7-5, 6-4 at the No. 5
position, and Ed Martin defeated
Pitt’s No. 6 seed Rich Monteleone,

2-6, 6-4, 6-3. The score going into
doubles competition was 4-2, with
Pitt’s needing only one out of the
three matches for the victory.

Pitt went one better, winning at
second and third doubles in straight
sets. Coach Dieffenbach was pleased
with the play of the team, especially
both winning doubles teams, against
the surprising Tartans.

“CMU was more difficult than we
expected,” he said. “We had to play
well to beat them. It was good to
have a close match like that because
it meant that the doubles counted. 1
was really pleased with the play of
the No. 2 doubles team of [Chuck]
DeVera and Lash."

The Panthers have one more
home match left, today at 3:30 p.m.
against Youngstown State. They
may also reschedule the Robert
Morris match for Tuesday, but they
really want Youngstown State. To
beat them will require “consistent,
aggressive play” by the Panthers.

This match means a lot to the
team for it would guarantee at least a
.500 record for the year.

Panthers court victory

“Since we can’t go to the NCAAS,
having a .500 season is the only way
to determine how successful we
were,” Dieffenbach said. “It would
be a real accomplishment consider-
ing the below .500 start in
Tennessee.”

There is also a little incentive
being added by Dieffenbach to get a
victory today.

After the St. Vincent’s victory, the
coach said that if the team were to
finish .500 or better, he would try to
schedule a midwest swing, possibly
in Michigan, for next year.

“With a win against Youngstown
State, we would havean outstanding
season. We have a lot of freshmen,
but they have worked really hard
since September,” Dieffenbach said.
“The schedule was also one of the
toughest we have played in I0
years.”

So. the Panthers‘ outlook on the
I984 season may well rest on the
outcome of one match. This out-
come can be inﬂuenced by some fan
support, something the Panthers
have had little of this season. Dief-
fenbach said that this little intangi-
ble could very well be the difference,
so, try to get up to Trees courts
today at 3:30 p.m. to root the Pan-
thers on to a winning season.

Nationals

gymnasts

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

  
 

Tough competition at the NCAA
National meet this weekend tripped
up the hopes of Pitt’s lady gymnasts
Lisa Shirk and Alisa Spector. Shirk
retained her All-America status by
placing eight in the ﬂoor exercise,
but aside from this small victory,

  

    
   
      
    

 
   
   
  

21Q.543.4511 both Shirk and Spectorpwere over—

whelmed by the competition.
§ K I D  N G Shirk, who was the national
CIOVOIOHC P0” R.D. 2 BOX 216 champion on the uneven parallel
. ; bars three years ago, failed to live up

to her past by scoring a 9.35 on the
bars. She also scored 9.35 on the
vault, 8.35 on the beam and 9.4 in
the finals of the ﬂoor to become an
All-America once again. -

    

Parachutln school _gGarr_ettsvl|l _ g

The scores Shirk received in the
vault, beam and bars competition
placed her below the cutoff for ﬁnals
competition. She became eligible for
the floor exercise ﬁnals by placing in
the top 10. This berth also made her
an automatic All-America.
