BAS kicks
off I 987
Black
Week

By William Young

Assistant News Editor

The Black Action Society
kicked off the 18th Annual Black
Week yesterday with Gospel
Night. This year's Black’ Week
has been dubbed ”A Celebration
in Pride” in order to raise con-
sciousness within the black com-
munity at Pitt that the black
heritage is one to be proud of.

”The intentions of Black Week
are a celebration of talents,
strengths, accomplishments, peo-
ple in general and who we are,”
said Lynette Wellington, chair-
person of Black Week.

”We considered several
themes before we decided that
‘Celebration of Pride’ was the
most appropriate theme,” Wel-

v Iington said. ”It’s supposed to re-

mind us in situations where
people are holding us back or
outside forces are keeping us
down, that we have something to
celebrate over and be glad."
The Black Week program is
designed to make a broad range
of events available to everyone.
”With Black Week, we try to
provide a well-rounded set of

' programs,” Wellington said. ”We

provide programs that are spiritu-
al, social, cultural, educational

and political.”

Wellington stressed that Black
Week is not merely for black stu-

' dents but for the entire student

body.

”Just'because it's Black Week,”
Wellington stated, ”doesn’t mean
it's only for blacks. We want
everybody to come out and par-
ticipate.”

Wellington said that she want-
ed everyone who participates to
be able to get something out of

it. She believes that anybody who
takes part will find something
useful to them.

”After this week is over, the
black students will be able to take
a better pride in themselves,”
Wellington said. ”Other people
should get a better understanding
of blacks. I feel I put together a
program that anybody could
enjoy.”

important is the Minority Jobs

WASHINGTON — Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole is
launching his campaign for the
1988 presidential nomination as

' the clear runner-up to Vice Presi-

dent George Bush in the polls,
but critics and supporters say he
faces lingering questions about
personal style and political con-
tradictions.

As Dole embarks on his cam-
paign from his hometown of Rus-
sell, Kan., there is general
agreement on the impressive
steps he has taken in the last 12
months as he has emerged from

’ the pack of Bush's pursuers.

’’I think we're ready to go one
on one” with Bush, said Bill Lacy,
a key campaign aide. ”The thing
that pleases me most is organiza-
tionally, we've made dramatic
strides,” he said, referring to
strong fundraising and paid polit-
ical operatives in 35 states.

But others say that won't be
enough.

”Dole has a marvelous sense of
humor, but it's like a two-edged
sword,” said one campaign aide,
speaking on condition of
anonymity. "This aide said Dole

must be careful to use his humor
on himself, and not use it for ”un—
derminingand deprecating an
opponent” .

In public he has accomplished
that thus far, but in private, Dole
is still capable of cutting, acidic
remarks. According to one aide,
when Dole was musing about
how to answer a debate question
on which portraits he would hang
in the White House, he said he
would put up pictures of the men

-he has defeated in past cam-

paigns.

Weinberger warns of
Soviet arms trickery

WASHINGTON Defense
Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger
warned Sunday that the Reagan
administration has ”to be very
careful” in reaching a nuclear
arms accord with the Soviet Un-
ion and said the United States
must maintain its military strength

as a deterrent to Soviet attack.

Weinberger, who announced
his resignation Thursday, also
said he believed that his chosen
successor, national security ad-
viser Frank Carlucci, would not
use the Strategic Defense Initia-
tive, commonly known as ”Star
Wars,” as a bargaining chip to
additional arms accords with the
Soviets.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gor-

bachev will meet with President
Reagan on Dec. 7 in Washington,
where they are expected to sign
a pact eliminating intermediate-
range nuclear missiles.
. ”We do have to be very care-
ful with any agreement that we
make,” Weinberger said on NBC-
TV’s Meet the Press. ’’First of all
that it's verifiable because the
Soviets have a long record of
cheating in theseagreements and
secondly that we have the'mi|i-
tary strength and keep the mili-
tary strength after the agreements
are over.

Cash lost
in freak
«highway
accident

By Dwight Woodward

Associated Press Writer

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Many of
the passersby who scooped up
hundreds of thousands of dollars
that fell from an armored truck
are holding on to the money, and
nearly two weeks later, the city
was still buzzing with talk of mys-
tery and morality.

No one has said how much is
missing, and police admit they
face a difficult task in getting the
money back. .

’’I’m not saying it's going to be
easy,” Franklin County Prosecu-
tor Michael Miller said about the
chances of successfully prosecut-
ing anybody in a case-with appar-
ently little physicalevidence.

An estimated 200 people con-
verged on Interstate 71 moments
after the rear door of a Metropoli-
tan Armored Car Inc. truck swung
open Oct. 28, sending bills rang-
ing from 105 to 1005 fluttering to

-the pavement. 

The airborne bills looked like
snow, said one of the first police
officers on the scene. The truck
continued for at least a mile be-
fore the drivers realized what had
happened, witnesses said. .

Tales about the passersby have
made the rounds, including one
about a woman supposedly seen
stuffing cash into her under-
clothes.

”Don’t forget, there was no ar-
mored car in sight,” said Michael
Berens, police reporter for The
Columbus Dispatch. ”You just
have cash, hundreds of thousands
of dollars blowing around the
highway.”

Larry Bromagen, 31, a high
school social studies teacher, said
a debate broke out among
teachers at his school when
Bromagen said he would have
kept the cash.

United Way raises record    

amount of funds in '87 drive.

A record-breaking $31,534,743
mi-llion has been raised by the
United Way so far this year, ac-
cording to W. Bruce Thomas,
.1987‘ United Way of South-
western Pennsylvania campaign
chairman, vice chairman of ad-

officer of USX Corporation.

Thomas spoke last week before
hundreds of United Way volun-
teers at Carnegie Music Hall.

Thomas said the money raised
to'date is only 99.5 percent of
their total year end goal of $31 .7
million.

The United ,Way has so far
raised 4 percent over last year's
total. ”We’re almost there, but to
make it, we must all continue to
work very hard, providing a
strong finish to the ongoing cam-
paigns and encouraging every in-
dividual, company and
organization to make a pledge
and be a part ofthis crucial com-
munity effort. Our 140 agencies
and the 400,000 people they
serve are counting on us,” said

D8 Israelis taken ho

BEIRUT, Lebanon —— The Abu

. Nidal- Palestinian terrorist group
- said Sunday its guerrillas seized

a French-registered boat Off the

‘ Israeli-Occupied Gaza Strip and

took the eight Israelis On board
hostage.
Walid Khaled, identified as one

Of the factiOn’s leaders, said at a
«news conference in Moslem west

Beirut that the captives were five

‘men, a woman and two children.

He said they were unharmed.

”They were given all essential
medical and humanitarian care,”
he told reporters.

”We shall transfer them to a
safe place, where representatives
Of the lnternatonal Committee of
the Red Cross can examine
them,” Khaled said.

He said the I 7-ton boat was fly-
ing the Israeli and Belgian flags
but was registered in France. He
declined to say when the vessel
was stormed.

In Jerusalem, the Israeli army
said it had no knowledge of the
vessel's seizure.

”The Israeli army is not ac-
quainted with the incident,” the

army command said in
statement.

Abu Nida|'s faction, known as ,

Fatah-Revolutionary Council, has
been issuing its communiques in
Lebanon since the Syrians closed
down the group's information
offices in Damascus earlier this
year. _

Khaled said all eight captives
are Israelis with dual nationali-
ties. He said five hold Belgian
passports, and the woman holds
a French passport.

Khaled warned Israel against
launching reprisal attacks on
Palestinian refugee camps in Le-
banon, ”Otherwise the prisoners’
lives will be in danger.”

Iranian missiles kill
many Iraqi civilians

NICOSIA, Cyprus —- Iran said
it fired two su rface-to-surface mis-
siles into Baghdad Sunday. Iraq

reported that at least one missile
exploded in a densely populated
neighborhood, killing a large
number of civilians.

The attack came as Arab lead-
ers convened a summit in Am-
man, Jordan, to seek a united
stand behind Iraq in its 7-year-Old
war against Persian Iran.

The missiles, fired less than an
hour apart during the evening, hit
Iraq's state—run television and ra-
dio headquarters and the capital's
central communications center,
‘said Iran's official Islamic Repub-
lic News Agency.

Iraq's official news agency, also
monitored in Nicosia, said at
least one missile exploded in a
heavily populated residential dis-
trict, killing "’a large number Of
innocent civilians, including
women and children."

Iran fired five missiles into
Baghdad last month, saying the
attacks were in retaliation for Ira-

_ qi air raids against what it called

”nOn-military targets.”
Sunday's twin missile attack

was launched a few hours after

Iran said in a military commu-

and Iranian artillery pounded

IRNA quoted a statement by
Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps
as warning that ”mOre smashing
blows will be inflicted On Iraq's
military, economic and industri-
al centers if the Baghdad regime
continues its mischievous acts.”

In another development, Libya
said Sunday it would ”al|y itself
militarily with Iran” if the Amman

hands through the rubble Of a
community center where the
bomb was planted in this County
Fermanagh town near the Irish
border.

The blast blew out one end of
the building and the structure col-
lapsed, trapping men, women
and children against sidewalk
railings. I A

Police said three married cou-
ples were among the six women
and five men killed, and that
many Of the wounded were bad-
ly hurt in the 10:45 a.m. blast.

A 14-year-Old member of the

BOy’s Brigade said he was stand-
ing near the war memorial ready
-to lay a wreath when the blast
came. -
”I dropped the wreath and
rushed to where the wall had col-
lapsed. People were screaming,
and we did all we could to pull
them out. At 11 o'clock we
should have been remembering
the dead, not digging them Out,”
he said.

The Rev. Michael Jackson, who
had been waiting near the com-
munity center at the monument
to the war dead for the ceremo-
ny to begin, said, ”PeOple start-
ed to scream and people started
to run away — those who could
—- but it was obvious that many
would have been killed ins-
tant|y.”

New mother loses sexual interest in her husband .

Q: I had a baby two months
ago and am happy to be a
mother. I seem to be doing just
fine in recovering from the vagi-
nal delivery and am successfully
nursing my baby. My problem is
a complete lack of desire for sex.
I go through the motions, and
have been doing so for a month
now, but I am increasingly turned
off by the whole idea. My "hus-
band is having a hard time deal-
ing with my lack of excitement.
Please help me. This is seriously
affecting my marriage.

DR. RUTH
WESTHEIMER

A: I hope not, and I hope that
you are only worrying about this
because you think that you
should be thinking more of your
husband and not entirely about
you and the baby. But what you
are going through happens regu-
larly in marriages when children
are born, and good marriages sur-
vive this the way they survive
measles, plumbing breakdowns
and the intrusions of the tele-
phone and TV on private life.
Naturally, you are preoccupied
with your baby.

Many, many women temporar-
ily lose sexual desire at this time.
Not all women, but you are
among the entirely‘ normal per-
centage of women who do go off
sex for a while after the baby ar-
rives. Your husband can under-
stand this, and you can give him
some kind of touching and‘ some
consoling words and tell him you
will want to be his lover again in

a while, and it will be better than

even
But this is an important time in

— your life, one of great change and

involvement, and all your feel-
ings are going another way for a
while. You can hold him some-
times, or let him hold you.
Perhaps you can give him some
affectionate if not passionate
pleasuring, not taking full part in
sexual A encounters. Don't feel
guilty or rushed. Perhaps in a
month or so, if you feel no stir-
ring of your old interest in sex,
you should see a sex therapist for
a visit or two. For now, care for
the baby.

Q: Can the dimensions of the
male organ be enlarged, and
how? And will a curve to the left
cause any problem in having sex
with a woman? s

A: There is no way to enlarge
this organ the way muscle-

care unit.

”|t’s not a major setback, and
it's not a giant leap forward

either,” Riebling said. ”It’s one

more bump on the road to recov-
ery, a small bump. We're hoping
for smooth sailing.”

Tabatha received her five or-
gans from a brain—dead Virginia
girl during a 15-hour transplant
that ended Nov. 1.

The procedure had been per-
formed only twice before in the
United States, in 1983 at Chil-
dren's Hospital and last year at
Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's
Hospital in Chicago. The first pa-
tient,'a 6-year-old girl, died a few
hours after surgery, while the se-
cond patient, a boy, survived just
four days. .

Tabatha was born. with a fatal,

failure from a highly concentrat-
ed liquid diet she had to take be-
cause of the condition.

The toddler needed only a new
liver and small intestine to sur-
vive, but doctors said it was less
complicated to transplant the
five-organ group. ~

‘Up until Friday evening,
Tabatha had been showing
remarkable recovery, watching
television, playing with her dolls
and looking at the scores of cards
and gifts she's received from well-
wishers around the country.

”She’s got to recover from the
second surgery now, but I don't

task,” Riebling said. ”It’s just a

builders enlarge upper arms or
chests and, fortunately, there is
no need to do so. As we sex edu-
cators say again and again, as
often as this age—old question is
asked, size is not important —
performance and knowledge of
sexual functioning are. Women
may have to adjust their lovemak-

ing style to either a smaller or_

larger male organ, but when they
do complain, it is about perfor-

mance and attention and skill —
not equipment.

You have to give dimensions in
your letter that are adequate. I
don't print them here because
there might be opening and shut-
ting of drawers all over the coun-
try as guys look for rulers!

I can't predict how the leftward
curve will affect sex with a wom-
an. You have to find a nice wom-

an you want and who wants you

and see how your shared sex.

goes.

Remember, there are several
basic positions for intercourse
and many variations on each bas-
ic position. Men and women,

with their individual male and fe- '
male conformations,_ find their’

own ways of doing things and
helping each other. But find a
nice relationship, and when the

time is right, see what happens.

Interested in a Cape Buffalo
mount? How about an old
printer's job case? Maybe a white
porcelain soup tureen like the
one your grandmother had?

— If you're feeling the least nostal-
gic and can find your way to
5854 Ellsworth Ave. in Shady-
side, Jim Cornelius is the man
you want to see.

Cornelius is the owner and sole
proprietor of the Antique Corner,
where he’s'been buying and sell-
ing antiques and collectables for
the past 13 years. '

Cornelius claims he's not
”stiff.” Nor are rocketing price
tags his sole concern. You'll rare-
ly find period pieces from the
Louis XIV or Victorian eras and,
as Cornelius says, ”any money is
good money.”

Cornelius said his collection
started, ”like everyone else’s in
this business,” as a hobby —— and
as a sideline to his sales career.
Then, through his experience and
ability to trim the usual travel
time involved in sales, he found
the extra hours he needed to go
in search of new items to add to
his collection. His storerooms

and attics filled slowly to the "’

brim, until one afternoon in
1975, he took the great plunge.
Cornelius gave his boss two
weeks notice and opened his
doors. ' '

Cornelius said his decision
wasn't easy. ”You always collect
what you like,” he said. ”It’s
when you can part with that first
piece that you've made the tran-
sition.”

A Pittsburgh resident, Cornelius
said he was surprised at the rela-
tively small number of antique
dealers in the Pittsburgh area.

”There was a lot of wealth here
in Pittsburgh during the Industri-
al Revolution,” he said.

Cornelius added that the once— '

booming glass industry along the

Mike Watt of flREHOSE pulled
up a chair, leaned into the micro-
phone, and loudly said, ’’Hello,
America." Watt, the bassist,
served as spokesman for the band
before last Thursday's appear-
ance at the Electric Banana. At
present, f|REHOSE is in the mid-
dle of a 30 day, 30 stop tour in
support of their soon to be
released album, If’n.

f|REHOSE’s first album, the in-
tense Ragin’ Full On, was a suc-
cess as an independent release.
The album took five days and
$2,300 to produce. The result
was the college radio hit, ”Brave

Captain," and album sales of
25,000 copies.

Watt praised his label, SST, for
their trust and support of f|RE-
HOSE. f|REHOSE was then a new
band, combining Watt and Ge-
orge Hurley of the Minutemen
with a complete unknown — Ed
”fROMOH|O” Crawford.

Watt said, ”Hey, I got this kid
from Ohio, and I'm going to
make an album with him. They
(SST) just said OK.” SST’s liber-
al treatment of bands is cited as
amaior reason why f|REHOSE re-
mains with SST instead of seek-
ing major label» distribution.

flREHOSE’s main concern is
getting their music and its politi-
cal, provocative messages across
to people with ”a minimum of

hassle and interference.” While’
they pride themselves on remain-
ing ”non-mersh” (their slang for
non-commercial), they are acces-
sible through records, CDs, and
the ”Brave Captain” video on
M T V .

f|REHOSE’s new album should
prove an even bigger success
than.Ragin’ Full On. It uses the
same live in the studio produc-
tion techniques as the first album
but uses less acoustic guitar and
will be more ”Rock ’n’. Roll.” in
style.‘ -
The title comes from Bob Dy-
Ian's song ”Don’t Think Twice,
It's Alright.” Watt said the title
reflected the band's attitude dur-
ing production. He felt confident
about the new album, and was

flREHOSE is following up Ragin’ ull On (above) with a new album entitled If’ . They played the Banana lat Thursay

quick to mention the musical
progress made by the group's
members.

Watt described singer Ed Craw-
ford’s voice as ”road-hardened"
and said Ed's guitar playing was
greatly improved. The new al-
bum features a greater variety of
songwriters, featuring three lyrics
by Ed; two songs from drummer
George Hurley; a song by ex-
Black Flag member Kira; and
those of Watt himself. ~ V

The album was described as
”extremely political” and will
contain a variety of styles. Unfor-
tunately, the album’s release date
has been delayed until Novem-
ber 25th. '

During the interview, Watt
readily discussed his experiences

with the independent music bus-
iness. A former label owner, he
brought up some interesting ideas

about the industry's problems, Si 2
He pointed out that the arrival A

of CD technology has been one
way of preventing smaller labels
from receiving shelf space for
their products. He is proud that
SST has developed the capacity
to manufacture CD5 and put

Last Friday night at Graffiti
was a case of ”you had to be
there.” Lee Ritenour and his
band played two shows. I
caught the first show, and it
was dynamite. \

Brought to Pittsburgh by
promoter Mike Elko, Lee
Ritenour’s first show. was a‘
sellout performance, with
many of his fans vocalizing
their enthusiasm throughout
the evening. Master of

Ceremonies Ron Chavis, an

announcer for WAMO-AM,_

got the audience psyched for’
Ritenour’s jazz of the '80s.

Ritenour played an acoustic
guitar for most of the evening.
in regard to the sheer quality
of the music, it was true to the
studio recordings. I've heard
Ritenour’s Rio on compact S
disc, so I knew what to expect.
Sitting close to the stage, the
music suffered little from d_is-
tortion.

Fortunately, Ritenour’s band

ments and sound system, so
distractions, like feedback or
too much bass were delightful-
ly non-existent.

Ritenour played 12 songs in-
cluding ”The Sauce,” ”AM At-
titude,” ”Water Solo,” ”Earth
Run,” ”Har|equin" and "Rio
Funk!’

Joining the" band on stage
was vocalist Phil Perry, who
was one of the artists perform-
ing on Ritenour’s latest LP,
Portrait. Clad in a polka-dot,
silver, double-breasted suit,

Lee Ritenour and band produce the jazz of the 80's

for many of the show’s songs.

Downstairs from the stage at
Graffiti, Lee and his band
members tried to unwind after
the show. An untouched bot-
tle of Johnny Walker Red was
on the table as they all cried
out for coffee.

Despite his mild case of ex-
haustion _from playing on stage
for over two hours, Ritenour
was laid back and friendly.

’’I won my Grammy for Best
Instrumental Performer for my
Harlequin album. The next al- ,

recorded in Japan and features

said Ritenour. . ,

A requiem for a friend in Afghanistan

 

 

fV|ARK
BROWN

Several weeks ago, I was hav-
ing a cup of tea and listening to
National Public Radio — outside,
a rainy, fall day. As I went
through my morning routine,
NPR gave an Associated Press
report that I didn't need to hear.

A couple of days before, film
director Lee Shapiro and his
cameraman Jim Lindelof were
killed in an ambush west of
Kabul, Afghanistan. According to
Cable News Network, one
Westerner is missing in action.

Jim Lindelof was a buddy of
mine.

While I was in Afghanistan dur-
ing May of this year, a man who
was helping me learn the ropes
in Peshawar, Pakistan, suggested
that I Contact Jim because of his
firsthand experience in Af-
ghanistan. He had been a para-
medic in the Panjsher Valley in
I 985, arriving there the day after
the Soviets had airlifted in two
battalions" of paratroopers to
stomp the local Afghan rebels.

When I met him, Jim was on
the crew of independent film-
maker Lee. Shapiro, who is best
known for his controversial

-  - ,. ,., V_..-.. H

documentary on Miskito Indians
in Central America. Having a
paramedic around in a war zone
was a prudent move.

I needed a good bit of factual
information on war develop-
ments and dealing with the re-
bels, so on May 4, Jim agreed to
meet me for lunch at La|a’s Grill
at Green's Hotel. Most Western-
ers in Peshawar eventually wind

up at Lala’s despite the terrorist

bombing of Green's in 1986.
People just don't sit near the win-
dow anymore.

Jim was a decent sort. He was
a dead ringer for guitarist Gary
Vincent. When a number of Pakis
sat down within earshot of our ta-
ble, we decided that they were
folks who didn't need to hear us
talk about sensitive issues. We
changed topics to brands of beer,
college pranks —— harmless talk.
Jim had attended UCLA, his
.mode of transportation in
southern California was a bicycle.
He had been in and out of Af-
ghanistan at least nine times.

In order to help me get a fuller
picture of how to survive over
there and how much to trust my
Afghan hosts, be arranged for me
to meet with several British Com-
monwealth journalists.

Just speaking English with these
people was a pleasure. They all
did their best to explain the cold
reality of one of the weirdest
guerilla wars of all time. We had
a support network there, where
the journalists looked out for
each other. We agreed to meet in
London after the war was over
and paint the town red, maybe
hop over to Frankfurt for some
real fun.

Jim won't be there.

The Associated Press story left l

out a lot of important facts which

I'll have to gather, _but ifJim got -

shot up west of Kabul, his
chances for survivalwere nil.
Some sympathetic Afghan doc-
tors in Kabul may have been able
to treat his wounds, but the act of
getting him to Kabul would have
exposed the underground net-
work there.

You may be wondering why I
refer to Jim as a buddy and not
a friend. Americans learned in the
nightmare of the Vietnam war
that a buddy can't hurt you as
much as a friend can. Emotional-
ly, that was a defensive measure
that helped keep people from
cracking up under the strain.

In war zones, people suffer. In
time, those who are killed be-

come memories. A ‘commander I

on a battlefield cannot get too
emotionally attached to his
troops, despite the lengths to
which he must drive them. The
death and mutilation in a war is
real. Each day is an unpredicta-
ble series of chances to be killed.

The last time I saw Jim Lindelof
was when he, General Sajani’s
son and the British journalists
paid me a visit after I had some
problems with my malaria medi-

cine. We chatted for a long time,
swapped some mementos and
caught up on war developments.

‘ We were all serious about tear-
ing London apart. I wonder when
that will happen.

Part of what I'm going through
today is called ”survivor guilt.”
I survived. Jim didn't. If I
wouldn't have been prescribed
Fansidor for malaria, would I
have been behind the. lines with
Jim and Shapiro? Would my
presence have possibly saved
them? Why am I stuck in Pitts-
burgh in a cozy college lifestyle
when I've got buddies shot to
pieces on a muddy mountainside
near a place they'd have trouble
pronouncing? I go to bed with a
full belly every night, and my
buddies behind the Russian lines
subsist on rice, bread and tea —
when they're lucky.

Some take journalism serious-
ly enough to risk their lives to get
the story. Unfortunately, Jim
didn't bring us the news, he be-
came the news. Rest in peace,
Jim. J ‘

Pot. Abortion. Opinions of du-
bious respectability. The fashion
for this fall in the government is
the admission of past indiscre-
tions. The Alcholics Anonymous
of politics. Let's get it all out there
in the open and let the news me-
dia sort out the morality.

I have to wonder whether
there's anything our intrepid
band of government officials
have missed. Are there any other
secrets lurking behind their
smiles, secrets we feel a right to
know?

0 Speeding -— I wonder how
many of our officials have shown
a flagrant disregard for the law
and pushed their cars over the

- posted limits. How can any per-

son be so disrespectful of the law
and still be permitted to ad-
minister it?

Maybe we should run a check

A double standard in the university

For those faculty with the vi-
sion and will to see beyond the
perimeter defined by their own
tenure and lucrative TIA-CREF
retirement package, they will see
that a glaring double standard ex-
ists in many schools of the univer-
sity, one which benefits the
faculty and discriminates against
staff employees. The double stan-
dard relates to salary and job
security.

It is not uncommon for ad-
ministrators, particularly vice
presidents, deans and chairper-
sons of departments, to begin to
get resentful of a staff worker who
has been in place for a decade or
more, and who by virtue of hav-
ing stayed alive and having
received no more than cost of‘liv-
ing increases, reaches a point in

T his or her employment where

they are making a decent and
reasonable salary which might
even be several times greater than
that of an entry-level worker, who
could replace them tomorrow.

Never mind, for example, that
the laboratory technician, elec-
tronics repairman, secretary, ad-
ministrative aid or machinist has
been doing a conscientious job
and has been a dependable and
productive employee. To many
Chairpersons, such a staff wor-
ker's salary is viewed as a big
chunk of the departmental budg-

et. The following thought enters ‘
; . his mind; Find some pretext to: ~

 

     

on all our representatives and ap-
pointed bureau(c)rats. Get all
their moving violations out in the
open. Speeding is nothing more
than reckless endangerment of
other motorists, and I, for one,
don't want anyone with such a
dangerous disregard for life in
office. V

0 Drinking — Alcohol is a de-
bilitating drug, whatever its legal
status. If an official drinks, he
might be intoxicated when the
time comes for a crucial decision.
As the result of a few martinis, we
could all be jeopardized.

We could interview all the offi-
cial’s friends from college and
find out whether the person in
question was ever observed in a
state of intoxication. Should such
be the case, immediate dismissal
would certainly be in order. Each
citizen of legal drinking age
should be forced to carry a card
stating that he is not employed by
the government. To get a drink,
‘it would be necessary to carry the
non—government employee iden-
tification. ' ‘

Our leaders have to be of un-
blemished moral character, and
many suppose they already are,
so a new law to that effect would
certainly cause few problems.

0 Sex — The Gary Hart inci-
dent showed us that our sexual
adventures should be made pub-
lic, that even what goes on’ be-
hind the doors of a bedroom is

. reasonable subject matter for

news analysts. The problem,

though, is that it is very difficult
to keep track of all government
employees’ sexual lives. The Mi-
ami Herald doesn't have a staff
big enough to cover all of
Washington. But we should be
watching.

Maybe we could issue chastity
belts to anyone given a govern-
ment job. It could be made part
of the official swearing-in
ceremony.

”... and do you solemnly swear
to uphold the Constitution, de-
fend the country and, above all,
not to engage in any extra—marital
hanky-panky? Do you swear that
the only hanky-panky in which
you'll participate will be of a
clean nature, that you will not
employ the various sexual aids
and stimulants available in the
worst parts of our cities.”

”Oh, yes, Your Honor. Yes I do
indeed.” ‘ -

”Good, then I do bequeath to
thee this official United States
government chastity belt. Please
remove your trousers, so it may
be fastened to your person. The
only key will be given to your
wife, and it can be removed only
in the event of a divorce or of
your removal from office,
whichever comes first.” ‘

That may be taking things a lit-
tle too far, even for the new puri-
tans in Washington, but the
image of the Chief Justice fight-
ing with the buckles on a chasti-
ty belt, the president with his
pants around his knees, the popu-
lation looking on approvingly, it

get rid of the staff worker, replace
them with a new employee and
save the department $15,000 to
$20,000. -

Many non-tenured staff on this
campus are falling victim to this
deplorable practice while others
are well aware of the game and
live in a state of constant fear,
gripped by the anxiety that der-
ives from an awareness of their
chgronic vulnerability, a vulnera-
bility which only deepens with
each passing year. ‘

Now for the other element of
the double standard — the te-
nured faculty member who has
gone to seed, become petrified
and ‘ metamorphosed into what
we euphemistically refer to as
dead wood. With rare exception,
the various departments and
schools of this university all har-
bor tenured but grossly un-
productive faculty members who
have not done a stitch of

' research, written a book or pub-

lished a paper in years.

Those same individuals often
have‘ teaching loads so embarass-
ingly light that they hardly justify
their $50,000 to $70,000 salaries.
It is not uncommon to find such
dead-in-the-water faculty in the
laboratory growing African. vio-

lets.’ and watc ing cact

    
 

       

      

  
 

when they should be doing ex-
periments or writing papers.

I fear that if this trend con-
tinues, the ever-expanding dead-
wood faculty will turn the univer-
sity into one of the city's largest
greenhouses. Yet, rare it is to find
a chairperson who will take ac-
tion against such loafers who no
longer meet the criteria they once
had to satisfy when they were ac-
corded the academic free lunch
we call tenure.

Professors aren't the only ones
who benefit from the double
standard. The university's bloat-
ed administration is overflowing
with highly paid paper-shufflers
who do little more-than serve as
handmaidens at special events
like the bicentennial. [...],

If the .wise men in the
Cathedral of Learning really want
to save the university money,
they should begin by pruning
some of the freeloaders on the
faculty and in the administration
rather than victimizing some
hardworking and conscientious
poor bastard on the loading
docks of Scaife Hall or in the boil-
er room at the Law School who

‘is making $19,000 ’r’ibefo‘re

was just too much to resist.

0 Atheism — Oh, Jesus, where
would I ever start? In this one na-
tion under God, the land of the

. free (so long as we embrace the

currently popular philosophy),
the nation that places its mone-
tary trust in a centuries-old myth,
it is certainly reprehensible to not .
be affiliated with at least one of
the various institutions designed I
to spread the Word.

Possibly, we could have a writ-
ten exam for piety that would_be
required of any seeking public
office. Candidates would be
quizzed on their understanding
of various philosophies, and they
would have to sign a form
promising to continue belief in
their God, no matter what the
evidence.

At the end of the test, at least
the one for candidates of a Judeo-
Christian persuasion, there
should be a section asking them
to list the 10 commandments. —
When they get to the one about '
killing, the test should ask them
to defend, in 500 words or less,
how it is possible to subscribeato 0
ideas in that list and still support
a military installation.

So there you have it. If it seems

Rob Lowe has no penpals, but his ghostwriter does

BURBANK, Calif. (AP) --
Hundreds of thousands of fans
who write to screen idols are get-
ting personal replies, thanks to a
woman who makes it her busi-
ness to keep their dreams alive.

Spanky Taylor, the 34-year-old
president of Fan-Handle lnc., is
the paid ghostwriter for young
heartthrobs like Michael J. Fox,

' Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and

Judd Nelson.

”Answering fan mail is very im-
portant to an artist's career,”,Tay-
lor said. ’’If a child doesn't get a
response, they start to get skepti-
cal and eventually feel
alienated.”

Equipped with computer, stars’

stationery and stock phrases de- "

veloped after interviews with her
celebrity clients, Taylor tries to
make her letters sound as if the
star had actually written them.
Volume makes it impossible for

: stars to answer their own mail.

Fifteen-year-old Alyssa Milano,
for example, who stars in the TV
series Who's the Boss? gets up to
10,000 letters a week.

Most of Fan—Handle’s clients
are male, and most of the mail is
from teen-age girls asking about
relationships, the star's family and
pets, school and hobbies, Taylor
said.

BEIJING (AP) —— French movie
star Alain Delon celebrated his
birthday Sunday by appearing be-

and performed under a doctor's

observation during another, two

newspapers reported Sunday.

Karajan, 79, canceled a Berlin
Philharmonic concert Saturday
night in Stuttgart, and the tabloid
newspaper Bild am Sonntag said
it was because he was ill from
food poisoning.

Another tabloid newspaper, the
Frankfurt Abendpost Nachtaus-
gabe, said Karajan became sick
after eating fried chicken and was
barely able to conduct a concert
Friday night at the City's Old
Opera.

The newspaper also reported
that Karajan stayed in bed at a

LOS ANGELES (AP) ~ Dr.
Haing S. Ngor, the Cambodian
refugee who won an Oscar for his
performance in The Killing Fields,
told demonstrators protesting the
Soviet Union's 70th anniversary
that communism must be fought.

’’In my country, the ‘killing
fields’ are not over yet,” Ngor
told the gathering ‘on the City
Hall steps, as protesters held up
prison bars with the names of
countries under communist rule.

”They won't end until millions
of dollars go to support the fight
against communism and the
Soviet Union.”

Ngor, who has lived in the '

United States for six years and
who became a U.S. citizen last
year, said Americans seem to be
unaware of torture and execu-
tions in communist countries.

In the 1985 film, Ngor por-
trayed Cambodian journalist Dith
Pran, who was captured and tor-
tured by the Communist Khmer
Rouge after American forces
pulled out of Southeast’ Asia.

Movies
about
women

By Bob Thomas

Associated Press Writer

Among the major items for
consideration by film historians is
the emergence of movies about
women that were made by wom-
en. |t’s a welcome trend, and
something entirely new, though,
there is precedence in the 1930s
films of Dorothy Arzner (Craig's
Wife and The Bride Wore Red).

Now comes I've Heard the
Mermaids Singing, a new Cana-
dian film by Patricia Rozema that
transcends its modest cost of
$272,000. Her vivid and surpris-
ing imagination, coupled with a
startlingly original performance
by Sheila McCarthy, helps make
the film a rare and unexpected
dehght

Polly Vandersma (Sheila
McCarthy) is a contented loner
without family, friends or lovers.
She lives in a small Toronto apart-
ment which she plasters with
photographs she takes of other
people's lives. This is her escape,
her dream life, and indeed she
can envision herself soaring ec-
statically over the city as mer-
maids sing. _

Although a temporary—work
agency considers her virtually un-
employable, Polly finds work in
the office of an art dealer (Paule
Baillargeon) who is tolerantly
amused by her.

Polly becomes infatuated with _

her boss’ style and intelligence,
though, she resists any suggestion
of romance (the curator already
has a lover, played by Ann—Marie
MacDonald). V

Polly is shocked to learn that

the curator has been lying about

her own artwork, and when the
curator rejects Polly’s anony-
mously submitted photographs
Polly freaks out. But her violent
act is not what it seems, and all
ends happily.

Patricia Rozema’s script is a
fragile basis for a movie, and the
ending is a letdown. But the

brightness of her dialogue and‘

the perception of the camera's
eye make Mermaids worth
watching.

It is primarily the performance
of Sheila McCarthy that saves the
film from preciousness. She is on
camera most of the time —— she

narrates her story into a TV sur— ‘

veillance camera she has stolen
from the gallery — and her quirky
face is ever fascinating.

The most prized scene comes
when Polly is treated to a
Japanese lunch by her employer.
She struggles with sitting on the
mat, tries to eat the hot towel and
orders blindly, ending up with a
large octopus.

The title, incidentally, comes A

from T.S. Eliot's ‘The Love Song
of 1. Alfred Prufrock: ”l have
heard the mermaids singing, each
to each. I do not think they will
sing-for me.”

The Alarm’ is making their en-
trance into the '88 pop climate
with the release of Eye of the Hur-
ricane, their third LP_. Produced in
London by John Porter (Roxy
Music, Billy Bragg and Eric Clap-
ton), the album was remixed in
Los Angeles.  ‘

Eye of the Hurricane marks a
departure from the anthemic

.A|arm of the past.

”We’re not out to make some
kind of’ almighty statement.
We're not on some kind of holy
pilgrimage. We're‘ just people
growing up and learning to cope
with our world,” said vocalist
Mike Peters.

Peters points out that the ‘album
is the product of much heartache,
blood and tears. ”We’ve rede-
fined the meaning of our friend-
ship in a new world,” he added.

The Alarm began playing
together in 1977, and in 1982,
signed with IRS. They came to
world attention with their single
”Marching On.” The message
was simple: preserve your in-
dividuality, and fight to realize
your dreams. I

producer Alan Shacklock, the
Alarm released their first full LP,
entitled Declaration. The record
entered the UK charts at No. 6,
and its single, "68 Guns,”
penetrated the American Hot
100.

In 1985, the Alarm released"
Strength, from which the songs
”Absolute Reality” and ”Spirit of
'76” came.

Perhaps the most important
moment in the history of the
Alarm was on April 12, 1986,
when they performed to 20,000
fans on the quad lawn of UCLA.
The show was telecast in a nine-
camera shoot for simulcast on
MTV. and satellite channels
across the globe — from the UK
to Australia, from Canada to Mal-
ta. This telecast thrust the Alarm
onto the international stage and
brought world recognition.

Almost two years after the con-
cert at UCLA, the Alarm has
released Eye of The Hurricane. As
a result of the UCLA concert, the

Alarm has found a much wider .

audience and will most likely
‘enter the American popular mus-
ic scene.

Volleyball team wins Ohio State Classicl

By Don Boyd

For the Pitt News

The Lady Panthers continued
their winning ways this weekend
as they captured the Ohio,State
Invitational.

After sweeping the host Ohio
State Buckeyes on Saturday by
scores of 15-6, 16-14 and 15-11.,
the Pitt women anxiously await-
ed the result of the Penn State-
Cincinnati match. The Lady Lions

of Penn State defeated Cincinna-

ti three games to one to advance
to Sunday's final against Pitt.
The Pitt-Penn State matchup, in
the final, was the kind of volley-
ball oné would expect when two
intense rivals meet. After winning
the first game fairly easily (15-8),
the Lady Panthers’ determination
led them to, consecutive, hard-
fought victories (17-15, 16-14).
According to head coach Shelton
Collier, ”A key factor in our vic-

tory over Penn State was our
defensive play. In most Pitt-Penn
State matches, Penn State has
more digs. Today, we had 82 digs
while. Penn State had 58. We
played great.”

Lisa Stewart, spearheading the
Pitt attack with -17 kills against
Penn State, was named tourna-
ment MVP. Joining her on the all-
tournament team was Pitt's other
top gun, Denise Frawley. .”When—

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. I

— The most coveted awards in
college football are the Heis-
man Trophy, the Outland
Trophy, the Lombardi Trophy
and the Maxwell Award.

However, with the excep-
tion of running back Craig
”lronhead” Heyward who has
an outside chance at winning
this year's Heisman Trophy,
members of the Pitt football
team don't have to worry
about winning these awards.

But, collectively, the Pitt
offense could be a finalist for
an Oscar.

And the category? -

Best imitation of Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde.

Quite simply, the Panther
offense has had more perso-
nality changes than Sybil.

And that could pose
problems for the 6-3 Panthers
at Pitt Stadium Saturday night
against 7-2 Penn State in a
game which will be televised
nationally by ESPN.

The Panthers’ second half
scoring difficulties were once
again evident in'Pitt’s 1 7-0 win
over Rutgers at the Giants
Stadium before a crowd of
25,444 fans and scouts from
the Sun, Peach, Liberty and In-
dependence Bowls Saturday.

The Panthers’ performance
was further testimony to the
gist of the Pitt attack: Go to the
locker room at halftime with a
lead, and holdon for dear life

A _ the last :30 miniutes.

The Panther defense held
Rutgers in check, limiting the
Scarlet Knights to 97 total
yards, and Heyward and quar-
terback Darnell Dickerson led
Pitt to 17 first-half points, as-
suring Pitt of its first winning
season since 1983, when the
Panthers finished 8-3-1.

Pitt didn't score in the sec-
ond half, as coach Mike Gott-

fried was content to play
conservatively and let the
defense control the game. Pitt
was able to keep the clock
moving, thanks to the running
of Heyward, who carried the
ball 28 times in the second-_
half. '

Heyward finished the game.

said Collier.

a number of interesting scenarios
for Pitt. Having already defeated
Penn State twice in two tries

”We held back the second
half and played a little more
conservatively. Of course, our
defense was playing so well,
so we let them play,” said
Gottfried. .

_The Panthers had the ball

times in~th_e' second half but .

Heyward was stopped short
of the yardage marker on a
fourth-and-1 at the Rutgers’
11-yard line in the third quart-
er, and Dickerson was stopped
short on a fourth-and-3 play at
the Scarlet Knights’ 13-yard
line in the fourth quarter.

Late in the game, a holding
penalty and two sacks

all season, two of which were
scored well after the outcome

' of the game had been
decided.

r ’’We could open it up in the
second half, try to get points
and then. shoot ourselves in
the foot, too. When you're
playing as well as we're play-
ing on defense, why gamble a
lot?” said Gottfried.

that's important to me. it's not
the statistics of how many
points you get in the second

‘half. It's not the statistics of
how many times you throw.
The statistic that matters is the
wins.”

While Gottfried isn't overt-
ly concerned with the Pan-
thers’ second-half scoring
problems, some players are
worried.

Said offensive guard Mark
Stepnoski, ”lt bothers me a lot.
Every time we get near the end
zone we self-destruct. If our
defense wouldn't have played
so well, we might have lost the
game because our offense was
so terrible in the second half.
Against Penn State, we can't
do that.”

Osborn said the coaches
have talked about the
problem, but no one has yet to
find a solution.

”We always have a com-
mittment we want to do well
the second half. That's some-
thing we pride ourselves on,

”There’s only one thing,

and it's something we're hav-
ing trouble with,” he said.

All the players agree Hey-
ward isn't being used too
much in the second half. Os-
born said the scoring opportu-
nities have been there, but the
team hasn't converted.

Said Osborn, ”lt’s not like
we give up. We controlled the
second half. We just didn’t put
the ball in the end zone. We
just can't get in.”

Dickerson, who completed
eight of 22 passes for 108
yards, is also dumbfounded
about Pitt's second-half woes.

”We’re really supposed to
be the team that dominates the
second half. I don't know what
[the problem] is,” he said.

In the first quarter, Pitt
scored on a 20-yard field goal
by Jeff VanHorne and a 1-yard
run by Heyward after the Pan-
thers recovered a fumbled
punt at the Rutgers’ 9.

Pitt added a second—quarter
touchdown on a botched play.
With a first-and-goal at the six,
‘Dickerson fumbled while at-
tempting to hand off to Hey-
ward, but the ball took a
perfect bounce — right into
the freshman quarterback’s
hands — and he ran into the
end zone untouched.

PANTHER NOTES: Pitt's
dominance was evidenced by
its 16-minute margin (38-22) -
in time of possession. The Pan-
thers had 386 total yards in the
game.

Steelers

Chiefs

By Doug Tucker
AP Sports Writer

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -— Gary
Anderson, 90 seconds after miss-
ing a 41-yard field goal, drilled a
45-yarder Sunday to give Pitts-
burgh a 17-16 NFL victory over
Kansas City and hand the Chiefs
a club record-tying seventh con-
secutive loss.

It also was the second straight
game against Pittsburgh in which
the Chiefs’ defense and special
teams scored every point.

Nick Lowery’s third field goal
carried 38_yards with 10:36 to
play and gave the Chiefs, 1-7, a
16-14 lead.

After Anderson was wide right
from 41 yards out, the Steelers,
4-4, got the ball back when Ger-
ald Williams recovered Christian
Okoye’s fumble on the Kansas
City 27. Anderson then kicked his
winning three-pointer with 4:02
to play.

It was a fumble by Okoye, a
250-pound rookie running back,
that led to Chicago's fourth-
quarter touchdown in a 31-28
victory over the Chiefs last week.

The Chiefs, making their first
home appearance since Sept. 13,

”This sets up a critical game
with Penn State for Pitt," said

bowl turnout for next week will
be pretty heavy.”

The win was the Panthers’ sixth ‘

of the year, assuring them of their
first winning season since 1983.
That year, Pitt went 8-3-1, includ-
ing a trip to the Fiesta Bowl.

0 In the Panthers’ nine games
this season, the defense has not
allowed a touchdown in four of

those games. They shut out North
Carolina State 34-0 and Rutgers
17-0 while holding West Virginia
to one field goal (6-3) and Navy
to two field goals (10-6).

0 The defense was anchored
by junior linebacker Jerry Ol-
savsky, whose seven tackles led
the team. Olsavsky, however,
wasn't overly-pleased with his
performance.

”We had a couple of break-
downs. That was my guy — the

guy that got the touchdown that '

was brought back,” said Ol-
savsky, referring to a second
quarter play where Rutgers
scored on a reverse handoff,
which was thrown for a touch-
down but nullified on a clipping
penalty by Rutgers.

’’It [the play] lingers, but the
win eases that. I'm just happy to
win,” Olsavsky added.

'0 The play of freshman quarter- '

Steelers

Continued from page 16

Maas, who went to_the Pro Bowl
last year as a noseguard, fell on
the ball on the 6-yard line, got up
and lumbered into the end zone-.

The lead held until 3:59 re-
mained in the second half and
Rodney Carter, capping a 90-yard
drive, caught a 4-yard toss from
Malone for the first of his two
touchdown receptions.

Lowery sent the Chiefs into
halftime with a 10-7 lead by kick-
ing a 41-yarder midway through
the second quarter. Carter's
26-yard touchdown catch gave
the Steelers a 14-10’ lead with
9:55 left in the third period. Low-
ery’s 27-yarder, following a Kan-
sas ‘City interception, trimmed
Pittsburgh's lead to 14-13 early in
the fourth period.

The Chiefs also lost seven
straight in 1985. '

Kansas City's defense and spe-
cial teams also scored every point
last December in a playoff-
clinching 24-19 victory at
Pittsburgh.

Kenney, a week after throwing
four touchdown passes against
Chicago, hurt himself with two
critical interceptions. Thomas
Everett stole an underthrown
Kenney pass on the Pittsburgh

9-yard line, and Dwayne
Woodruff intercepted another on
the Pittsburgh 3.

The Chiefs had driven from

-~ their own 21 to the Steeler 22 in

the second quarter when Everett
victimized Kenney for his first
NFL interception, giving Pitts-
burgh the ball on its own 10.
John Stallworth, working
against backup cornerback J.C.
Pearson, caught consecutive
passes for 13 yards each in the
ensuing 13-play drive. On
second-and-20 from the Chiefs’
31, safety Deron Cherry made a
diving. interception of Malone’s
pass at the goal line. But pass in-
terference on cornerback Albert
Lewis wipedout the play and
kept the Steelers’ drive alive for
Carter's first touchdown catch.

Carter, a second-year running
back from Purdue, was wide
open on his second catch, mak-
ing the reception without a

I defender within 10 yards of him

as the Steelers took a 14-10 lead
5:05 into the second half.

Mark Robinson intercepted
Malone midway through ‘the
fourth period and returned it 17
yards to the 24 to set up Lowery’
third field goal. '

PANTHER
NOTEBOOK

back Darnell Dickerson was im-
pressive, despite the fact that he
completed only eight of 22 pass-
es for 108 yards in his first start
of the season. Dickerson was the
victim of a few dropped passes by
his receivers,‘and he was sacked
three times. His scrambling skills
enabled him to pick up 42 yards
rushing and prevented him from
being sacked again.
Dickerson’s top receiver in the
game was junior Bill Osborn,
catching three passes for 44
yards, including a 23-yard pass in
the second quarter. Osborn
couldn't seem to say enough
about Dickerson’s performance.

young and enthusiastic,” said Os-
born. ”I’m excited how much he
has improved this.week."’ '

0 Osborn was one of 14 Pan-
ther players from New Jersey and
was fortunate enough to play be-
fore the hometown fans. Osborn
was injured in’ last week's Syra-
cuse game but was ready to play
against Rutgers.

”It was a big game for me,
coming home,” said Osborn, ” 
besides it being six wins and the
possibility of going to a bowl
game. I didn't practice all week.
I wanted to play so bad.”

0 Junior right cornerback Cor-
nell Holloway replaced starting
senior Gary Richard early in the
game and showed that he's ready
to step in and help Pitt's secon-
dary next season.

Holloway, who had four tack-
les and an interception, came in
for Richard, who suffered a ham-

string injury in the first quarter.

Billy Owens, Quintin Jones 
and Richard are in their senior .

seasons, and only Troy Washing-
ton will return from the secon-
dary next season. Holloway’s
play against Rutgers showed he
has the ability to fill a cornerback
position.

0 Ezekial Gadson received the
Toyota Leadership Award for last
week's game against Syracuse.

The award is presented week-.

ly by Toyota for a player from
each team participating in the
CBS-broadcast football game of
the week. Selections are made by
coaches and faculty advisors,
based on their contributions to
the team, school and community.

Against Rutgers,» Gadson
recorded two sacks, bringing his
school-record total to 21 ‘/2 with
two regular season games re-
maining.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —
For junior tailback Craig ”lron-
head” Heyward, playing before
the home crowd in New Jersey
can be a rewarding experience.

Not only did Heyward have his
finest game of the season, but to
do it in your hometown makes it
sweeter.

”I’m happy to come to Jersey
and get a victory. I'm just enjoy-
ing winning in front of the home
people,” said Heyward. ”They
see me and cheer me on. I'm still
doing what I did when I was

here.”

Many had reason to cheer be-
cause Heyward rushed for a
season-high 175 yards on 41 car-
ries. He has 1,236 yards rushing
for the year, the highest single-
season total since 1976 when
Tony Dorsett rushed for 2,150
yards. Pitt still has two remaining
games and perhaps a bowl game.

Heyward has rushed for more
than 100 yards in all nine games
this season, a mark of consisten-
cy that has made him a Heisman
Trophy candidate, something
Heyward feels has helped the
team.

”Being up for the Heisman has

helped the team, not just for me.
Knowing that you have someone
on the team that can possibly win
the Heisman, I think, helps,” said
Heyward.

’’I don't know how people
think about me being able to be
the first 260-pound tailback to get
1,000 yards," he added.

Heyward has been a work-
horse for the Panthers this season,
carrying the ball 284 times
through nine games, an average
of 31.5 carries a game. But all this
work doesn't seem to bother him.

’’It doesn't bother me a bit. I
did it once before [a school-
record 42 carries against Notre

 
 
  
 
  
   

T

Dame]. Each week, I seem to like
to carry more,” said Heyward.
”At this point, I-’m getting used to
it — carrying 35-40 times a game.
That's why as the game goes on,
I get better.”

Head coach Mike Gottfried
realizes the effort Heyward
shows on the field, and he
doesn't hold back his praise.

”.He works so hard out there.
He was facing a lot of eight-man
fronts. He's constantly pounding

against eight-man fronts, and he

earns every yard he gains.

”He gives us the ball control
we needed. He's a legitimate
Heisman Trophy candidate. I

he's done for us,” added
Gottfried.

Pitt must now turn its sights to
Penn State this weekend. Hey-
ward knows the importance of
this game, one he feels they are
ready to play.

”lt’s going to be a great game.
We're not the best of friends,”
said Heyward. ”This rivalry has
been going on for years. It was
here long before I came and will
go on after I'm gone. It's not go-
