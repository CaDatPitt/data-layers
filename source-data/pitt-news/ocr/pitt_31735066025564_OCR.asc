Sexual assault is a I
realityon campus’

Byjohn Temple

Staﬂ Writer

More than 24 female Pitt stu-
dents receive counseling each
year at the Pitt Counseling Center
for recent acquaintance sexual
assaults and rapes, according to a
center estimate.

Numerous sexual assaults occur
in the resident halls, and come to
the attention of resident assistants,
said Mary Ellen Hiotakis, a resi-
dent hall director .and director of
the Sexual Assault and Violence
Education program.

One in six female Pitt students.

will be sexually assaulted or
raped during her four years,
almost. always by an acquain-
tance, according to Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape, to which
many Pitt student are referred."

Despite the frequency of these
cases, one rape and no attempts
were reported to the Public Safety
Depaitment in 1991'. Also, despite
the large number of cases that
become known to counselors
and RAs at the un_iversity, a Pitt
survey taken three years ago indi-
cated that 63 percent of female
students who have had sex
against their will never told any-
‘one about it.

The reasons why cases of
acquaintance sexual assault and
rape are not officially reported to
university of legal authorities vary,
according to people throughout
the university.

“Acquaintance rapes are not
likely to be reported because [the
victims] have all these feelings
about why they let themselves
into the situation,” said Robert
Gallagher, director of the
Counseling Center. “Frequently
there is a lot of alcohol involved.”

Others reported that victims, for
different reasons, are afraid of the
legal process. a

“A lot of the problem for a
young woman who reports a sex-
ual assault is that very early in the
process she is made aware that
this is a crime, a felony, and that
if she pursues it, [she and the
accused person] will be caught

up in the criminal justice predica-
ment,” said Dennis Donham,
assistant vice chancellor for
Student Affairs.

Susan Rubiscli—Gisler, the~

University Student Judicial System
Coordinator, said that on the few
occasions when she has dis-
cussed pursuing a _ludicial Board
hearing with a victim, the victim
did not want to press charges,
sometimes for fear of seriously
damaging the other stud‘ent’s
record.

This situation presents a legal

and ethical dilemma to university ~-

administrators, W110 know that
Pitt students are committing and
suffering rapes and sexual

' assaults but not reporting them.

“We have been discussing [sex-
ual assault policiesl from a_ univer-
sity perspective,” Vice Chancellor
for Student "Affairs William
Harmon said during..Tuesday
night’s open forum between stu-
dents and administrators.

“What is our ethical and moral
role in a situation like this when
we know a crime has been per-
petrated but the victim does not
want to take action?” he said.
“Can we take action? I’m leaning
in the direction that, yes, we can
take action.”

If a victim reports a rape to
campus police but does not want
to press charges, the campus
police still identify the suspect
and investigate the incident,
according to Gary Moses, assis-

tant director of the.Public Safety‘

Department.

However, the university cannot .

conduct a Judicial Board hearing
without the victim present and
identified to the accused, accord-
ing to Rubisch-Gisler.

“That is the biggest question
the victims have when they are
asking about a hearing — can the
report be anonymous?” said
Rubisch—Gisler, who said there

' has been no such hearing in, her

two—and—a-half years on the
Judicial Board.

“Mono — oh no, that’s it for
me!” If you are diagnosed with
mononucleosis (or mono) don’t
panic. It doesn't mean the end
of your college life. Most of the
fear of mono is based on com-
mon misconceptions about this
illness. In fact, mono is a short-
duration viral illness without
adverse or long term conse-
quences. ~

The mono virus is usually
transmitted about two to six
weeks before symptoms
appear. It is believed to be
transmitted through saliva and
mucous.

It is not, howeverphighly
contagious. We rarely see
roommates, family members or.
couples become infected at
the same time. In general,
you should not worry. about
giving the virus to others but
deep kissing might be avoided.
Once you have mono you are
usually immune from getting it

To test for mono a blood

help. You can take ibuprofen,
acetaminophen or aspirin for
pain. However, you should not
take any other medications,
including birth control pills,
without your MD’s approval.
Also avoid alcohol or recre-

ational drugs. Alcohol intake
shouldbe restricted for about

six weeks. Mono causes the

Moomreogts ,~.t,/mi the  aaaatiwe  

liver to enlarge and drinking
a-lcohol_or taking drugs can
cause further damage. You are
also advised to avoid any pres-
sure and/or direct blows to the
abdomen in order to protect
your liver and spleen against
rupture. This means no strenu-
ous activity suchas heavy lift-
ing, contact sports, jogging and
running.

After initial diagnosis, you
should see a physician again
four weeks later, or sooner if
there is an increase in your
symptoms, such as yellowskin
or eyes, dark urine or severe
abdominal/back pain.

Most students with mono

continue attending classes with
a minimal change in lifestyle.
Remember, the best thing you
can do to reduce your chance
of catching mono, as well as
many other illnesses, is to eat a
healthy diet and get plenty of
rest.

away from its pursuers, and
then the second vehicle
stopped in the bus lane with
the police directly behind it.
‘The driver of the Jeep
pulled into the driveway of
the William Pitt Union, then
got out of the vehicle and
walked up the steps between
Amos and McCormick
Residence Halls. Several cam-
police cars arrived
moments later, but the driver
was gone. After checking the
Jeep’s license plate, police dis-
covered that it had been

stolen.

The driver of the first car
told police that he didn’t
know the Jeep’s driver but
though-t he had recognized
him as a friend and had
pulled into the bus lane to fol-
low and try to talk to him.
Police searched both vehicles,
finding matching tools in both
and liquor in the second car.

Campus police cited the dri-
ver of the second car for
transporting liquor but did not
arrest him. They did not have
enough evidence to link him
to the driver of the Jeep.

The next morning when the
cadets-in-training came out for
PT (exercise) they had seven
Dis (drill instructors) on them. I
guess with only five they
weren’t learning enough.

  

Back at the barracks I attend-
ed a rifle range safety class.
Then it was lights out (bedtime).

The next morning, some
cadets complained about the
breakfast. It was creamed beef
on toast, called “shit on a shin-

gle."

“I don’t know what you’re
complaining about. I already
chewed it up for you,” supply
technician Jerry Morrison said.
Again, I thought the food was
OK, and filling.

attention in recent years on the
subject of campus sexual assaults
has motivated recent legislation
which is causing colleges every-
where to review their sexual
assault policies and procedures.

Assault

The Campus Sexual Assault
Victim’s Bill of Rights Act of 1991
has spurred Pitt to work on the
sexual assault policy. I

“We have brought in people
from all over the university [to
develop the policyl,” Assistant

Vice Chancellor of Business and
Finance John DeVitto said at
Tuesday’s open forum. “It will be
a lengthy process.”

Part of the new act requires
that colleges treat victims with
seriousness and dignity. Gallagher

said that in his experience, the
campus police have always been
gentle and helpful to victims. Yet
the .cases continue to go unre-
ported.

Counseling helps victims
decide what course is best to

take, according to Gallagher.

“Some victims get some coun-
seling and then feel strong
enough to take some action,”
against their assailants, he said.
“And taking action often has ther-
apeutic va1ue.”

A vote for Clinton

It all started in New Hampshire. Characters named
Bush, Clinton, T songas, Buchanan, Brown and “that little
Texas billionaire with big ears” graced television screens
and front pages of newspapers around the country. They

were all trying to win the confidence of their respective _

parties and bring them to the promised land on Nov. 3,

‘)1992. Through the jockeying and debating, three men

stood tall. And it is of these three men that the voters of
this country will choose to lead their country forthe next

four years. In 27 days we will either choose President-

George Bush, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton or that lit-
tle guy with the big ears to live in the White House. As
should be the case, we are going to toss Perot aside and
leave him to Larry King. Hopefully we can do the same
thing with Bush in a month and a half. 0

President Bush has proven to be an inept leader. His
record on the economy, the environment and inability to
work with Congress proves it. Furthermore, one has to
question Bush’s commitment to women’s and minority
issues with his questionable appointments to the
Supreme Court. And even where Bush is said to have
done a commendable job + for example in foreign poli-
cy — we disagree. The primary thing to rememberhere
is that you cannot be strong abroad unless you are
strong. at home. That is a lesson that Bush should have
learned, ironically enough, from the former Soviet
Union.

Secondly, as the party wl1ich claims a smaller role for’

government, Bush has stepped where he should not —
questioning family values. The role played here by the
Pats —— Robertson. and Buchanan —— raises concerns
about keeping government out of I the family and, most
importantly, abotg a small but vocal faction of society

< ’ which breeds intolerance.

. Bill Clinton knows what it means to be strong at home.
Some people call his plan wasteful spending, we call it
human investment. His commitment to education has led
to the highest high school graduation rate in the South,
and moreover, the state’s college enrollment rate has
increased from 38.2 percent in 1982 to 51.3 percent in
1991. Finally, with Al Gore as his runr1ing mate, environ-
mental issues will no longer be tossed aside.

In the end, we have to ask ourselves in which direc-
tion has this country gone in the last eight years? It is not

,~}..a difficult question to figure out. GNP has slowed to a

snails pace and, in a very real sense, America is being
forced to pay attention to the radical right which has
made a lot of headway into the Republican Party. If it
ain’t broke don’t try to fix it. Well it is broke. Can we sur-
vive another four years with George Bush? We don’t
think so. Is Bill Clinton the man who can straighten
things out? We think he can. That is why we endorse
Governor Clinton to be the next president of the United
States.

Bush is the best candidate for change

Bill Clinton says that when it
comes to economic policy,
George Bush is offering noth-
ing new. For someone who
equates “new” with “new gov-
ernment program,” that’s not
surprising, Clinton is offering
more taxes to support new
government spending that,
based on the results of past
decades of government
“investment,” is doomed to
lead to new bureaucracies,
more inefficiency,’ more debt
and few, if any, long—term
benefits to those it is meant to
help.

I agree that it’s time for
something new, but when it
comes to economic policy a
new government “investment”
program is not enough.

We need a fundamental
change in the way our govern-

- ment intervenes in the econo-

my. We need the policies of
George Bush.

Democrats have been trying
hard to portray the president
as the symbol of the status
quo. It’s the failed policies of
the Reagan—Bush administra-
tions that have led us to the
edge of economic disaster. So
the story goes. ‘

But take a look at the status
quo. In the past three years
Congress has raised taxes,
increased domestic spending
by 30 percent, killed the line-
item veto, the Balanced
Budget Amendment and cuts
in wasteful spending.

Congress has also perpetuat-
ed entitlement programs that,
while transferring wealth on a
negligible scale, stigmatizelthe
poor and give them no oppor-
tunity or incentive to partici-
pate in the workforce. I, along
with George Bush and the
Republican Party — as well as
most other Americans — find
this very offensive.

President Bush has some-
thing else in mind. He has
offered a variety of programs
to help revitalize our impover-
ished urban areas. The welfare

reforms he proposes would
reward people for hard work
and independence. His HOPE
program, for example, offers
grants to public housing ten-
ants and low-income
Americans to purchase their
own homes which fosters
more independence and gives
them a stake in developing
their communities.

Keith
Cump ston

But the president realizes
that those initiatives are use-
less without jobs. Bill Clinton
and other Democrats have
pointed out that tax cuts don’t
guarantee that “the rich”
(those who make $150,000
annually) will invest the
money. That’s true when the
tax codes and interest rates
favor consumption over
investment.

So President Bush wants to
change the tax code to
encourage the kind of invest-
ment our country needs. ,

His proposals to establish
“enterprise zones” offer tax
incentives for investment in
impoverished urban areas. His
capital gains tax cut proposals,
coupled with the current low
interest rates, makes capital
investments and real estate
investments more profitable
for both the rich and the mid-
dle class. '

The president has proposed
to cut income taxes by 1 per-
cent across the board,- which
would result in an average of
$261 a year for a family of
four making $45,000 annually.

In addition, he wants‘ to
increase the personal tax
exemption for dependent chil-
dren. Clinton, while raising
taxes on “the rich,” wants to
offer the middle class a
“choice”: a tax credit averag-
ing $150 to $300 or an
increase in the exemption for
dependents.

A major concern of the pres-
ident is the growing federal
deficit. Deficit spending isn’t
all bad — it can often help
jump—start a faltering economy
during recessionary periods —
but our leaders in Congress
have proven that they can’t be
trusted to use the tool wisely.
The result is what we call
pork.-barrel politics.

To stop the dangerous
trend, President Bush has lob-
bied for the Balanced Budget
Amendment, the line—item
veto and significant cuts in
thousands of programs that
cannot be justified sufficiently.

Does most of this sound
new to you? If it does, I’m not
surprised. Though the presi-
dent has fought for most of
these measures since he’s
been in office, very few have
passed. Congress slashed
funding for HOPE and stalled
on the education reforms'sup—
ported by the president and
40 states.

It took three and a half
years to approve enterprise
zones and they capped the
number of zones at 50. Now
they are trying to kill NAFTA.
You see, President Bush does
not represent the status quo.
He is as offended by it as you
are. -

The American people know
that Congress is a problem -
recent polls have given them a
17 percent approval rating.

So why would you want to
replace the man who has been
fighting them so hard with
someone who may rubber-
stamp everything they send
him? (Clinton certainly might,
when he finds out that
Congress doesn’t want his bal-
anced budget amendment
or welfare reform either.)

If you really want “change”
Clinton is not the way.

When Chuck D. of Public
Enemy lent his throaty vocals
to Sonic Youtlfs “K001 Thing,”
it seemed a monumental merg-
er of the underground worlds
two strongest outlets, Rap and
Independent rock. But it turns
out that the song was really a
forebearer for upcoming disap-

-pointments from both groups.

Appearing on SY’s debut
major label effort (Goo, DGC)
“Kool Thing” was a rousing,
true-to-the-game single that
brought back memories of
lusher, more beautiful moments
from SY’s brilliant past. But
Goo, as a whole, quickly tired

‘ and got hung out to dry like

socks on a line, thanks to an
overabundant dose of stripped-
down rock that bordered too
much on pop senses and not
enough on attitude.

SY actually dabbled in
melodic rock with Daydream
Nation, a bold two—record set

that playfully acknowledged —

the band’s tuneful side with
enough cacophony to keep
purists eager to listen. Then
came the napful G00, and now
we have _Dirty, the band’s sec-
ond effort for the DGC con-
glomerate and the first it hasn’t
produced itself.’ Dirty is easily
the most disappointing work of
the Youth’s influential career.
Only three songs stand out as
playable (Sonic Youth are
openly in favor of preserving
vinyl and put an extra track on
this effort for wax’s sake). It
seems that SY, which used to
revel in the bands anti—every-

Gordon, always the groups sex-
iest member, no longer turns‘
her attention towards sexual ‘
‘ posturing, but "rather sexual

harassment. on “Swimsuit
Issue,” one of the albums
stronger cuts. “I’m just hear for
dictation/ don’t want to be a
sensation,” Gordon growls over
a hyper stop-’n’- go guitar
drive. _

What makes Dirty so upset-
ting is the lack of guitars that
used to ring true on past
efforts. “Where the hell is Lee
Ranaldo’s guitar,” I kept asking
myself during various listens.
Obviously lost in harmonious

that seem to dominate every
tune. Things used to be that a
Sonic Youth record meant
months of daily enjoyment,

now it’s like weekend bad-S

minton with the folks.-i

The sound isn’t rough and
tangled, but boring and super-
imposed,‘ almost as if the band
was thinking too much about
its sound. I never thought I
could be this bored with Sonic
Ranaldo’s “Wish
Fulfillment,” with its cheesy
guitar riffs and- MTV—oriented
vocals is the album at its

crossover worst. “Youth Against.

Facism”. is Thurston Moore’s
politically correct outcry‘ attack-
ing everyone from Clarence

Thomas to skinheads. “This is
the song I hate,” Moore ban-
ters, and I couldn’t agree with
him more. ' ‘

“Sugar Kane,” which hints at
an infatuation with Marilyn
Monroe is a funky mid-tempo
groover that emphasizes
Moore’s vocals. The track
bursts with energy like no
other on the album, but it’s
clean production hampers the
albums highlight. Throughout,
the production ‘is clear and
granted more attention, unfor-

tunately for the worse. It’s,

oftentimes too crisp, and for a
producer who ‘is known for his
umpghl, Butch Vig doesn’t
allow the group enough free-

l._I ,
  I—I

dom to, explore and fad in and
out of tracks, the improvisation
is lost on Dirty.

V Sonic Youth has meant
everything to the sudden rush
of former Independent groups
who have landed on the pop

charts. Nirvana wouldn’t be)

jack without SY’s ability to

attract media attention early in 

the mid-'80s when Independent
rock was in its strictest phases.
But it was groups like SY (and
Big Black and the Minutemen)
who forced people to look at
music in a different perspec-
tive.

Sonic Youth, live, has always
been improvisational (The
Showcase section’s favorite
word). On the Goo Tour they
stuck to basics and cranked out
all new material with a few
classics. Some were disappoint-

ed, hoping to revel in past glo— ‘

ries. But, as the opening act on

‘Neil Young’s (SY’s hero), the

band went deep into its pock-
ets and tuned its guitars in
familiar warbled fashion and let
rip, pulling no punches while
delivering goods from its past,
upsetting the more traditional
Young fans and forcing beauty
upon the small contingent that
were more interested in Sonic
Youth than Neil Young.

As Gordon yelps on_“On The‘:
Strip,” “That was then, this is‘
now.” She couldn’t be more on’

target, but you couldn’t be
-more wrong if you miss ‘em.

street-burn‘ Bubber does. This
plot folds and unfolds in a

. series of justice done and injus-

tice twists. Eventually everyone
wins a little bit, making Hero a
pleasurable, if light, movie.
Trapped beneath the neat
shell of hero and hero-would-
be characters, there lies a
scathing parody of television
media in the United States.
Gayley, who has won the pres-

tigious “Silver Microphone”
award for journalistic integrity,
longs to cover just one story
about human excellence. She
is tired of the muckraking
involved in her field.
Personifying the “we delight
in your misfortune” side of the
press is Gayley’s cameraman
Chucky (Kevin J. O’Connor).
He is seen filming human
tragedies while congratulating
himself verbally for his “brav-

ery and award winning shots,”
all the while people are in
great peril. O’Connor’s perfor-
mance, brief as it is, is the fun-
niest in the movie. _
CNN’s coverage of
“Operation Desert Storm” is
parodied in clever fashion as
well. The unfolding develop-
ments of the crash of ﬂight 104
are covered in an overdramatic
and genuinely hilarious fash-
ion. Images of Wolf Blitzer and

Bernie Shaw are connoted as
channel four (Gayley’s and
Chucky’s employer) attempts
to keep ahead of the opposi-
tion with sensationalized
savvy.

Also parodied _are all the
“real life drama” shows on TV
today, ‘such as “Rescue 911,”

'1 “America’s Most Wanted” and

“Unsolved, Mysteries.” This is

\ done when channel four does

a dramatic re-enactment of the

crash of ﬂight 104.

Thepress parody and every-
one—is-a-hero message of Hero
make it an enjoyable movie to
watch. It is a strong message in
a neatly-disguised package; a
success for director Stephen
Frears (T799 Grzfters, Dangerous
Masons). With strong perfor-
mances from Hoffman, Davis,
Garcia and O’Connor, this
movie is a witty, light comedy
worth seeing.

‘Knapp and the demolition

crew known as the Irish offen-

and the Irish sledgehammer,
Jerome Bettis, comes smashing
through like a rumbling tank
to finish the job.

Bettis, a 6-foot, 247—pound
junior fullback_from Detroit,

tion of power‘, agility and
quickness poses a threat not
seen in the college game for
quite a while. It is not often
that a cannonball fullback
flashes occasional moves that
earn the description of grace-
ful.

 

‘ ‘‘I feel I’m a punishing run-
ner,” Bettis said. “I think I
have a little bit of lateral
movement, but I don’t put that
in my repertoire to say I’m a
slasher or anything like that. I
believe I’m a powerful running
back, and I’m a ‘pounder’ and
I feel I can pound it in there

Is it an off—tackle run by

Notre Dame defense not so golden

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

They have given up an aver-
age of 373 yards a game. They
have allowedfour opposing
quarterbacks to throw for over
200 yards passing in a game.
They are the obvious weakness
of their football team.

Sounds like the anemic Pitt
defense, right?

Try the

Fighting Irish

.. -"jefense.

While the aura and sugar.-
coated mystique of great Notre
Dame football exists in head
coach Lou Holtz’s offense, the
tradition comes to a screeching
halt when the Irish defense is
mentioned.

Despite returning 10 starters
from last season, the ND defen-
sive unit has been the number-
one liability of Holtz’s ‘92 South
Bend crew. With the exception
of a solid effort against Purdue,
1-5, the Irish defense has given
up at least 372 yards a game —
twice allowing over 400 yards.

xj While the seventh-year Notre

Dame coach expected troubles
on defense — particularly in
the line play — he didn’t antici-
pate two facets of the defense
that have failed time and time
again this year: the play. of the

secondary and the defense’s
inability to stop opponents on
third down.

The ND defensive backfield
includes cornerbacks Torn
Carter and Greg Lane; the
safeties are Jeff Bunis in center-
field and John Covington shad-
owing the tight ends.

“The biggest concern we
have is in the defensive sec-
ondary,” Holtz said. “I.didn’t
think that would be a problem
going into this year, but it has
been.

“[Another] thing that bothers .
us  [about the Irish defense] ,

is  we haven’t been real
effective on third down +-

third—and-eights, third-and—l

nines. People have been far too
successful on us. We’ve given
up some big plays.”

One of the big reasons why
the Fighting Irish defense has
been susceptible to the big
play could be the late arrival of
inside linebacker Demetrius
DuBose, who was suspended
the first two games for accept-
ing money from a Notre Dame
alumni while in high school.

If big plays are to be made
by the ND defense — more
times than not, DuBose will be
in the middle of it. A versatile
senior from Seattle, the 6-foot-

2-inch, 234—pound senior’s
presence on the Pitt Stadium
turf Saturday is Pitt head coach
Paul Hackett’s biggest offensive
concern. ,
f‘Clearly, Demetrius DuBose
is the key guy,” Hackett said.
“They rush him, they drop him
[in_-pass coverage] — I’m very,
very impressed with him.”
Helping DuBose stop the
Panthers’ running game is fel-
low inside backer Anthony
Peterson" (6 feet tall, 217
pounds).
~ Along with a young defen-
sive. fivesome, this duo draws
the inenviable task of stopping
an improving Pitt offense
that ranks third nationally in
total yards. The productivity of
Hackett’s air squad is a
combination of all cylinders
working in sync — cylinders
that are equally talented, Holtz
said. ‘ V
“The problem with Pitt is,
number one, their offensive
line is a very, Very good one,”
Holtz said. “They have a lot of
weapons and speed at wide
receiver. [Dietrich] Jells catches
your eye immediately.”
“They run‘ the ball well, [too].
I think that’s the thing that Pitt
does so well — run more two-

What does Demetrius
DuBose mean to the Notre
Dame Defense?

Imagine peanut butter
without jelly, orbeer with-
out pretzels or even worse,
Sonny without Cher.

DuBose, the 6-foot, 234-
pound linebacker, is defi-
nitely the most valuable
player on the Fighting Irish
defense, and maybe even
the best defensive player in
the country.

“Clearly, Demetrius
DuBose is. the key guy,”
Irish head coach Lo‘u"Holtz
said. “I mean he is all over
the field — I’ve been very,
very impressed with that.”

When Notre Dame comes
to Pitt Stadium on Saturday
night, all eyes, especially
those of the Pitt offense,
will be on DuBose.

After last week’s embar-
rassment by Stanford,
which scored 35 points in
the second half en route to
the victory over Notre

Du loose is irreplaceoz ble  
mom for Fighting Irish

Dame, the Irish defense
will be ready to perform a
reappearing act after many
claims that they may be
invisible.

“I think we’re just trying
to focus on getting better,”
DuBose said. “We just
want to go out and get
ready and play. We’re striv-
ing for overall consistency
in all aspects of the defen-
sive plan. We still struggle
with our third-down situa-
tion.”

DuBose’s hard play‘ and
nose for the ball has not
gone unnoticed. He is con-
sidered one of the best
linebackers in the country.

This year he is expected
to be an All—American and
a Butkus award finalist.
Being the best is what
DuBose strives for.

“It’s good to be recog- _

nized as one of the top
linebackers in the country,
but I just want to go out
and do the best I can,”

DuBose said. “I want to be '

the best linebacker in the

Men's tennis Eiirebounds,

Byjason Brame
For the Pitt News

The men’s tennis team
improved its season record to
2-0 in match play with a
resounding 9-0 victory over the
Gannon Golden Knights. '

Dropping a total of only
eight games in singles play, the
Panthers cruised through the
match. —

Fresh off a disappointing per-
formance at the Eastern
Michigan Invitational, Pitt ran
into little resistance with the
Division 11 school from Erie,
Pa. Pitt head coach George
Dieffenbach went into the

match without the luxury of

Eric Weaver, his usual‘No. 1 V

seed, however, who ‘was
absent from the competition.

Weaver’s replacement, Alex
Cobbold, did not miss a beat in
adjusting to the new seed as he
rolled to a 6-0, 6-1 thrashing of
Gannon’s Matt Kellan.

“To use one of Weave’s
lWeaverl quotes, ‘cliche, cliche,
cliché,”’ Cobbold said. “[Kellan]
was ridiculous. It seemed like
he double-faulted about 87
times. My forehand was really
working today, though. I was
blasting it in both [singles and
doubles] matches.” '

USC. His ‘91 numbers earned
Bettis All-American honors. He
racked up 972 yards on 168
carries with 16 TDs and 17
receptions for 190 yards and
four more touchdowns.

All that established Bettis as
the best fullback in the coun-
try, and some observers —
namely the Sporting News —
call himthe best player in the
country, regardless of position.
Bettis’ name usually arises in
any Heisman Trophy conversa-
tion, and he has already been
nominated for the Doak
Walker Award, which is pre-
sented to the nation’s finest
back. '

.His domination can best be
characterized by last season’s
Sugar Bowl, where Bettis
unleashed a ‘memorable MVP
performance against a rugged
Florida Gator defense. Bettis
rumbled for three touchdowns

in a span of less than three
minutes during the fourth
quarter. Two of those scores
came on runs of 39 and'49
yards. His monster night in
New Orleans totaled 150 yards
on 16 carries and set the stage
for this highly-anticipated cam-
paign. '

But more than all the yards
and touchdowns, what Bettis
loves most is punishing the
helpless tacklers in his path.
For him there is nothing quite
like running someone over.

“I mean, it’s like a rush. It
just goes straight through me
becauseiit’s one of the great
feelings that you can have,”
Bettis said. “For me, I'm not a
linebacker so I don’t get a
chance to just hit anybody.
What I have to do is try to lay
a hat on somebody. Whenever‘
you can get a chance to run
somebody over, it’s a good
feeling because as a running
back you’re always being
pounded. So whenever you
get a chance to pound some-
body I think it’s real, real

gerous for the Panthers.

“I was very upset at the half,”
Luxbacher said. “It seemed
every time we were around the
goal and no one would take a
shot.” ‘

But things changed in the
second half as most of the
game "was played around CM’s
net. ‘Shapiro had some big
saves early, but it would only
be a matter of time before Pitt
would score, outshooting the
Tartans 13-4. .

Prex, probably a good.candi-
date for team MVP, didn’t play
much against CM.

“He’s a little bit tired and he
seems to be a step off in the
last game or two,” Luxbacher
said.

Pitt’s next game is at home
against SUNY-Buffalo at Pitt
Stadium this Sunday at 1 p.m.
Buffalo will not be taken lightly
since it has upset Big East foe

Syracuse earlier this season._,

The Panthers will not contin-
ue their Big. East schedule until
Sunday Oct. 25, when they
host Syracuse.  . . 

With -a win against the

Orangemen, the -Panthers will -'
s most likely secure a birth in the

Big East Championship.

nice.

Bettis’ bruising style is remi-
niscent of ex-Texas Longhorn
and Houston Oiler great Earl
Campbell. It's no coincidence
either since Bettis idolized
Campbell growing up.

“He had the speed to outrun
you, but whenever he got to a
pile it just seemed like he was
the only one standing. He’d
blast through there and he’d
put his helmet in somebody’s
chest and just bowl people
over,” Bettis said. “It just
seemed like he was having so
much fun doing that, and
that’s what inspired me.”.

Through five contests in ‘92,
Bettis has carried the ball 83
times for 435 yards (5.2
avg/carry) with four TDs. His
finest performance came at
Soldier Field in Chicago where

Bettis stormed for 130 yards

on 19 rushes
Northwestern.
However, last Saturday Bettis
and the Irish both fell victim to
the Stanford Cardinal. In N.D.’s
33-16 defeat, Bettis carried 17

against

times for just 54 yards, and
more importantly, coughed up
two crucial fumbles in the sec-
ond half. Those turnovers
were more shocking than the
Irish defeat itself.

“Jerome, who I think went
all last year with only one
fumble, had two fumbles in
the second half,” Notre Dame
head coach Lou Holtz said.

Most backs that put the ball
on the grass on two crucial
drives dwell on it, but Bettis
has already forged ahead.

“I’m gonna forget about it,”
Bettis said. “The way for me to
forget about it was to think
about it optimistically. I just
looked at what I did wrong,
just to make corrections. I
didn’t dwell on it. I looked at
it as I need to get better in ‘cer-
tain areas and protecting the
football was one of them.”

For his career, Bettis’ line
reads 266 carries, 1522 yards, a
5.7 average and 25 touch-
downs. If Bettis rushes for 93
yards or more against Pitt, he
will break into N.D.\’s Top 20

career rushing list. With over a
season and a half to play, his
potential accomplishments
seem limitless.

Entering ‘92, the Irish tail-
back slot was a bit of a ques-
tion with the departures of

Tony Brooks and Rod Culver. ‘

But senior Reggie Brooks,

brother of Tony, has quickly ,

emerged as an All-American
candidate as well, with 573
yards and seven touchdowns
on 58 carries. Brooks’ lightning

success has taken a few of .

Bettis’ carries, but Bettis said
the new one-two punch makes
it impossible to key on him.

“It puts me in the same situ-

ation that I was in last year,
where we had the powerful
running game with the power-
ful tailback,” Bettis said. “Now
people can’t just-key on me
and say ‘OK, we’re gonna

stop the inside game’ because‘

they know in fact that‘ Reggie
can tear them up on the ‘out-
side.” '

quite a bit. He is coming back off

; of an ankle injury which has

lijnpered his ability the last cou-
ple of weeks to make cuts that he
is normally able to make. I expect
to see him back in full force this
weekend.” «

,A good showing against Notre
Dame this week is no guarantee

2 of a starting position the follow-

ing week against Temple.

Peete said that Pitt’s depth in
the backfield will make it hard
for Martin to get that job back.

“To be honest, it is hard for me
to say Martin is going to come
back and be the starter,” Peete
said. “We got some guys right
now that played the last couple
of weeks and have done a good

“I feel Martin has to come and
earn his spot back. It is not like

I you’re the starter, you get hurt
 and you come back and be the

starter [again]. Whoever is playing
at the particular time is the
starter. If Martin plays hard and
does the things that he is capable

of doing, he has a chance. Right
now Colicchio has done agreat
job the last two weeks. He had

-over 100-plus yards [in every

game he has started].

"He had a great outing last
week against Maryland. Colicchio
"had 22 carries for 158 yards,
which is not a bad day.”

Not ruling out the possibility of
Martin wrestling the starting job

“away from Colicchio, Peete said

that the best running back will
get the start.

“The entire sports world is
competition,” Peete said. “You
compete against different individ-
uals. All I want to do as the run-
ning backs coach at the
University of Pittsburgh is put the
best guy in the backfield regard-
less of what year of school he is
in.

"The best guy is going to play,"
Peete said, "I don’t care what he
has done last year or yesterday. I
am going to go with the guy who
is doing it right now. Colicchio is
the starter.”

breezed through his match as he
trounced Marx D’Amico 6-1, 6-0.

“He sucked, the whole team
sucked,” Smith said. “I just
played the percentages against
him and used the match to work
out some kinks.”

James Chronister also enjoyed
an easy day as he dismantled
No. 3 seed Bob Hoinoski 6-0, 6-
1.

“It was a big difference going
from the outside game to the
inside surface, but everything
worked out pretty well,”
Chronister said. “During the tour-
nament you could tell that we
weren’t used to playing outdoors
but luckily we had the advantage
[of having experience on these
courtsl.”

Pitt's bottom three seeds also
won. Effium Gamett with a 6-3,
6-2 victory over Jim Sweeting,
Jeff Campbell beat Joe
Santangelo 6-0, 6-0 and Kevin
Sambuchino breezed to a 6-0, 6-
0 victory over Chris Folino.

Doubles play presented little
more challenge than singles as
Pitt won all three matches in pro
match scoring.

The team of Cobbold and
Smith defeated Kellan and
D’Amico 8-4, Campbell and
Dumpel beat Sweeting and
Hoinoski 8-6 and Richard Dodge
and Anirban Mukherjee
overcame Santangleo and Folino
8-5.

Smith was very critical of
Gannon’s doubles pair.

“This match was -nothing. They
were an extremely bad team,”

Smith said. “It’s hard to play dou- ‘

 

bles against such a bad team
because you are not Challenged
and you begin to lose concentra-
tion.”

Not surprisingly, Dieffenbach
was pleased with the team’s per-
formance.

“The match was good for us
because it helped the team to
gain some confidence,”
Dieffenbach said. “It helped
them to work on some of their
weaknesses.”

A recurring complaint among
both the team and opponents

16’ Cheese Pizza

has been the slick play of the
Astroturf surface. ‘It gives the
Panthers a decided advantage.
The Pitt players said they would
prefer playing on a different
court.

“Not many people know how
to play on these courts,” Smith
said, “because of this Astrolturﬂ.
They built it for the football team
and then put lines on it and told
us to go play tennis. There was
some talk of a new facility, but
so far there hasn’t been anything
done.”

pumping on all cylinders. With
this momentum, they bring their
fine—tuned offense to Pitt
Stadium Saturday night in hopes
of spinning the Panthers swivel-
door defense.

“This is a great offensive foot-
ball team,” Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said. “They have the

"ball-control attack that [Irish

head coach Lou] Holtz is famous
for.”

Holtz again has handed the
offensive reigns to senior
quarterback Rick Mirer. Mirer,
who has led the Irish to the
Orange and Sugar Bowls the
past two seasons, has started- the
season by throwing five touch-
downs while passing for 903
yards.

“We will have to put pressure
on Mirer,” Pitt cornerback
Vernon Lewis said. “A guy with
his ability will kill you.”

Mirer, when he has time to

zacé ao' zed 

Piano Players non—stop EVERY

throw, is almost unstoppable.
The Panthers nonexistent pass
rush must, somehow, get in his
face.

“They are throwing the ball
with Mirer more than ever
before,” Hackett said.

Mirer, who has passed for just
125 yards in his two games
against Pitt, may not pass at all
on Saturday.

He could hand the ball over
to his fullback Jerome Bettis.

Bettis is on pace for a 1,000-
yard season. In his first five

games of ‘92, Bettis has already »

churned out 435 yards and is
averaging 5.2 yards per carry.

“He’s something special,”
Hackett said. “He is running the
ball with more confidence this
year.”

Confidence should again be
on Bettis’s side when he faces
the Panthers this Saturday. Last
year, Bettis had a field-day when
he ran for 125 Yards on 17 car-

ries and scored twice in Notre
Dame’s 42-7 rout of Pitt.

This year, Pitt’s defense, which
has been depleted by the
Nationa_l Football League draft
and injuries, will have its hands
full with Notre Dame’s punish-
ing fullback.

But if the Panthers key on
Bettis, they might just watch
number 40, Reggie Brooks, cele-
brating in the end zone. Brooks,
a senior tailback, has paid his
dues and has waited behind star
rushers like Ricky Watters,

have to beg, borrow and steal
every idea to stop them.”

For all of the offensive punch
that Bettis and Brooks provide,
they would go nowhere were it
not for their tremendous offen-
sive line. Seniors Justin Hall and
Lindsay Knapp anchor a line
that can open holes for Bettis
and Brooks as well as keep
Mirer unscathed.

“Our offensive line has played
fairly well,” Notre Dame head
coach Lou Holtz said. “We have
a pretty proliﬁc offense.”

With a solid offensive line giv-
ing Mirer time to throw, Pitt will
have to look out for big—play
man Lake Dawson. The junior
wide receiver is Mirer’s main tar-

Another target Mirer can’t miss
is preseason All-America pick Irv
Smith. At 6 feet 4 inches, 246

basically everything you look for
at that position; He is compara-
ble to former Notre Dame All-
American Derek Brown, except
Smith can block. His blocking
skills also give the Irish an extra
lineman in those crucial third-
and-short situations.

Capping off the Irish offensive
threat is another A1l—America
candidate in senior kicker Craig
Hentrich. Hentrich is having a
tremendous season so far. He is
averaging a whopping 45.5
yards per punt and has been
solid on extra points and field
goals. 5

Having all these weapons,
Notre Dame still has some ques-
tions to ask itself as it goes
head—to—head with Pitt.

Will it be the speedster Brooks
burning the outside, the power— -
ful Bettis laying waste in the
inside or Mirer standing in the
pocket and throwing deep? The
answer: maybe all three.

country.”

Despite his numerous
accolades, DuBose is
unhappy with his perfor—
mance so far this year.

“I think I have a lot
of work to »do,”_ DuBose
said. “I don’t think I’m
wrapping up on my tackles
and getting to all theright
spots.” .

DuBose was suspended

. for the first two games
because of allegations of
him taking money from an
Irish alumni while he was in
high school.

Since his return, DuBose
has picked up right were he
left off last season.

As defensive Captain,

DuBose chooses to lead by
example rather than with
words. Vt _

“I don’t really pay too
much attention to {being
captain]  I just give the
guys the calls andjplay as
hard as I can.”

DuBose is a fierce hitter
and has an amazing nose

for. the ball. And the fact_

that Notre Dame runs a
5-2 defensive front allows
DuBose ‘all the room

he needs to roam -the grid?

iron. 2 .

V AgainstiPitt, expect num-

ber 31 to be called a lot

during the game.
Although‘Pitt is off to a

slow 2-3 start, DuBose

expects Saturday’s game to

a tough one.

“I think Pitt has a great
quarterback and a good
offensive line,” DuBose
said. “It’s gonna be a great
challenge.”

With all the individual
awards that DuBose will be
up for_ after this year, he is
concentrating on the team’s ‘
season performance. .

_“I just _want to go out and
help our football team win»
games and my future will
take care of itself  as long
as Notre Dame football
takes care of itself,” DuBose
said. ‘

“As far as the future goes,
I-haven’t really thought
about it that much. I hope
to got out on top.”
