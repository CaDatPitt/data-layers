which the student feels should

The Committee on Student
Affairs of the Faculty Senate
has initiated a four point
program in an effort to be-
come aware of problems of
student life at the Univers-
ity. ,D_,r._,Robert J. Agnew, associ-
ate professor in the Graduate
School of Business and chairman
of the committee, made the an-
nouncement of the program to-
day.

l The committee planiof action
is as follows:

student demonstrations and other
activities should not cause reper-
cussions that either the Universi-
ty or_ the Pittsburgh area will

of how far they can go, this does

that this forum might attract

Secondary School Committee

Students Visit Communities  

1 The Student Government
(SG) Secondary School Com-
mittee is offering University
students a chance to be part-
time “admission officers.”
The SG Committee was set
up this year to enable high school
students to receive a clearer pic-
ture of the University as present-
ed by student body members who
will have personal contact with
the students.

According to Barry Nudelman,
chairman of the SG Committee,
each area from which the Uni-
versity accepts high school sen-
iors will receive a student repre
sentative from the University,
himself a graduate of that high-
school or area. The size of the
committee will be proportionally
based on the acceptances from
each area.

The student representatives,
working in conjunction with
alumni representatives‘, will
speak with high school students
who have been accepted by the
University. (The program may
later be increased to include those

students who have only applied
to the University, but have not
yet received their acceptance.)

Besides being of benefit to per-

spective freshmen, says Nudel-

man, the committee will help,

University students themselves.
Since applications are open to any-
one, the committee will bring to-
gether people from every school
of the University and will
“aquaint the student body with
new ideas.”

Nudelman pointed out that the
committee’s idea has already
been tried on a smaller basis in
Youngstown, the New York area,
and some parts of Pittsburgh. In
one of the Pittsburgh schools, ‘a
“coketail party” was given for all
the high school students who had
been accepted into the Universi-
ty. The committee representatives
informally discussed the social
and ac-ademic aspects of the Uni-
versity with the students. Nudel-
man emphasized’ that “no high
school student who left after the
get-together felt that the Univer-
sity could be cold and imper-
sonal.”

Pitt Ski Club Offers

Excursions P St Instruction

bunnies and experts, the Pitt Ski Club provides numerous
opportunities for learning and practicing the sport.
The instructors, Thomas Graves, Les Guthorn, Scott
Lydick, Wayne Masterman, and Ruth Zuckerman, tetch bas-
ic fundamentals of skiing‘, new techniques, and point out

noticeable errors in a skier’s
style. They also explain rules of
the slopes.

Pitt YMCA
Hosts City
Hootenany

Plans are being made for the
fourth semi-annual All-City Inter-
collegiate event, sponsored by the

.., University YMCA in cooperation

withsarea colleges.

Past events have included hoot-
enanies and talent shows and
this year's event tentatively
scheduled for Friday, March 3,
will be a big surprise.

Cooperation from the area
schools, Chatham Duquesne, Tech,

Mt. Mercy, Robert Morris, Point 1

Park, and Washington and Jef-
ferson, have contributed to the
great success of these events.

The Joseph Home Company-
University YMCA All-City Col-
lege Trophy will be awarded to
the school who has accumulated
the highest total number or points
from the Fall Hootenanny and
the spring event. Robert Morris
won the trophy last year.

Admission will -50 cents per
person plus an ID card. For fur-
ther information call the Pitt
ther information, call the Uni-
versity YMCA, 212 SU, 621-3500,
ext. 281, or consult your local
campus represenative.

The club provides prospective 1

members with pre-season condi-
tioning exercises, information on
proper equipment, and ﬁlms of
experts in action. As a result, no
-member of the group has sus-
tained a serious injury thus far.

Under the leadership of Presi-
dent Masterman, the club is or-
ganizing a weekend trip to Eagle
Ridge, N. Y., Feb. 17-19. This
excursion, which is thehighlight

of the Ski Club's program, is be-.

ing offered to club members at
minimal cost. The club has al-
ready traveled to the Bear Rocks
ski area and trips are being plan-
ned to Laurel Mountain and Sev-
en Springs.

‘The committee now includes
students who have taken an “ac-
tive interest inxthe University,”
said Nudelman. Applications for
the committee may be picked up
as of now at the SU_ Desk. Nudel-
man added that applicants should
have three references ‘from the
staff, administration, or faculty
of the University, and a 2.0 mini-
mum QPA. Applications are due
by Feb. 21, ‘after which inter-
views will begin. Nudelman
stressed that those who qualify
pick up an application for the
Secondary School Committee and
take advantage of the opportun-
ity for “the enriching and re-
warding experience” of working
with high school students.

«ACLU Stand
Editor, Pitt News:
P-Upon Dr. Kurtzman’s appoint-
....ment as acting chancellor, The
, . .;'*‘§-Pitt News noted his Willingness
' '_ "'-to- discuss student problems di-
rectly with students concerned.
But as a result of the adminis-
7 tration’s reaction to a problem
of national dimensions, explicitly
involving a statement by the
Chancellor himself, the above in-
tention can be viewed with irony,
 annoyance.

- The focal point of the issue
--was-—-and still is——Dr. Kurtzman’s
. quite ambiguous reply to the
American Civil Liberties Union’s
request that colleges and univer-
-Vsities legally contest any House
on Un-American Activities Com-
ffmittee subpoena for membership
'=lists,of campus organizations. Ac-
?’-cording to The Pitt News of Jan.
6, 1968, “the University will take
__5n‘o stands . . . until such a sit-
”u'ation arises.”

The chronology of the prob-
em is as follows: 1) For a gamut
of  reasons, a number of
, ‘tudents felt -that the adminis-
5 tration’s policy ‘should be con-
structively clariﬁed and examin-
 before such as problem arises,
.5 that Dr. Kurtzrnan’s reported-
statement was an insufficient
 guarantee that principles of aca-
demic freedom and legitimate civ-
lliberties would not be abridged.

_ — On the front page of this paper there is a box entitled “Do you have
 gripe ?” Anyone who knows what’s going_on realizes how any Pitt stu-
dent will answer that question. Everyone can cite some policy that they
feel should be changed, discontinued or initiated. Now the faculty com-
mittee concerned with student affairs is asking the student to list these

 The logical result would be that the Committee would receive several
thousand letters, with each student loging his particular complaint. But
we have to be pessismistic about the results of the letter writing compaign.
Tragically we can predict that the Committee will not be flooded with let-C
-ters. As a matter of fact, we will be surprised if one hundred are written,
1 In essence the biggest problem of student life the Committee faces is
the all pervasive apathy of the students themselves. When one sits down
and talks with students all have something to say about the cafeteria, the
. Bookstore, Student Government and The Pitt News, Yet a small percentage
“of these same students feel any kind of committment to change these ills
_of,student life. Falling back into a comfortable ennui, they say “Oh I can’t
..:._do anything about it. The administration will do what it wants any way.”
‘A We realize we aren’t making any startling revelations when We say
is student disinterest. But like poverty, disease, and war, it is a con-
tinuing problem that must never be ignored. The Faculty Senate Committee
on Student Affairs represents an excellent vehicle whdreby students could

ed: Consequently plans were
made for representatives of the
students» and faculty to person-

ally request Dr. Kurtzman to»

clarify his statement.~

2) Students attempting to ar-
range an appointment with the
Chancellor were told by his secre-
tary that they should ﬁrst dis-
cuss -the matter with Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Helen Rush—appar-
ently to see if'it was ‘worth the
Chancellor’s time.

3) A week later, astudent call-
ing at the request of a professor
was told by the Chancellor’s of-
ﬁce that “rules” prohibited the
students from seeing Dr. Kurtz-
man, even if they were accom-
panied by faculty members. They
were again referred to Dean
Rush and were informed that if
the Chancellor was willing to en-
tertain discussion, Miss Rush
would also have to be present,
regardless of the presence of fac-
ulty members. '

4) Two students eventually met
with Miss Rush and were explicit-
iy told that because the Chancel-
lor cannot be bothered by small
student issues, her job Twas to
«ﬁnd out what the «students want-
ed. At the meeting’s close, she
said that consulting Dr. Kurtz-

man might take some time, and.

that the students should contact
her later.

5) In fact, it was only about
an hour later that one of the stu-
dents ran into Dean Rush in the
powder room. There Miss Rush
informed her that she had just
seen Dr. Kurtzman who inform-

articulate their concerns about the University. Though a new group, the
committee has already investigated several student problems and made
recommendations to the Dean of Student Affairs. The Committee itself
represents the divergency of the type

ed her that he would be happy
to receive a written statement
from the students but would per-
sonally meet only_ with faculty
members.

This vague procedure (there
are no “rules”!) and the vague
character of the way in which
responsibility is delegated inher-

ently impede the free discussion

of problems. This observation is
indeed condemning when’ one
considers the. importance of the
issue as indicated by the execu-
tive:_j:f_aculty support, by the fact

to over 900 colleges and universi-
ties, and most importantly by

‘the crucial questions of civil li-

berties that the administration

sider. if -

The issue involves the Chancel-
lor together with students and
faculty: he issued the statement.
If the Chancellor has not been
well informed as to the nature
of student-faculty concern, as the
above observations may indicate,
then fault lies with the Dean of
Student Affairs. If he has assessed
the situation accurately, then he
has abdicated a signiﬁcent M re-
sponsibility‘ as _well as contra-
dicted himself. But it is not neces-
sary to pinpoint speciﬁc flaws
and faults. It is enough to show
that the administration’s proce-
dure has been a condescending
affront to students and scholars
united on an important issue.‘

This indictment indicates per-
haps that the administration is
not really concemed with stu-
dent-facutly problems, that they
either don’t comprehend their
importance or feel consideration
of them _may interfere with their
public relations functions, and
that their avoidance is in some
measure intentional.

to an administrator, you are often making the appeal to the person who
set-the policy in the first place. But with the institution of the faculty
committee, this complaint is «no longer valid. These faculty members will
-rarely be the authors of the policies you are challenging. Therefore a stu-
dent. can feel free to discuss any aspect of administrative policy with the
committee,. knowing that his written statements will be held in confidence.

Further, we are certain that once ‘these letters are sent to the com-
mittee, the faculty members Will do more than «just give them a quick
glance. Tliey will try to sift out the common problems which seem to be
felt by a majority of the students, and then they will searchout solutions.

, This isuone instance where The Pitt News would be happy to be proven
wrong. Nothing would please us more than if bags of letters piled up on
the committee’s desk. The only way -to dispell the charge of apathy, is by
taking the initiative to comments by letter on a crucial issue of University

Kurtzman States Student Policy

In response to the above‘ letter,
The’ Pitt News asked, Chancellor

- Kurtzman to clarify his stand:

I

   

“In response to the statement

that I’d be glad to confer with
students, I do meet with stu-
dents who have been duly elect-
ed every month (the Student Af-
fairs Advisory Committee). I

can’t very wellﬂmeet with every,
. student who disagreeswith every

statement-I make; this is really
an impossible task.”

Concerning his stand on the
ACLU’s request to refuse to re-
lease students’ names to HUAC,
Dr. Kurtzman replied, “I’m meet-
ing with a faculty group Tues-
day on this very issue. I’ve made
my position clear, and if they

disagree with it, they have a,

right to express their views.

   

“My answer is that I frankly _

don’t think this is a situation
that would arise at Pitt, and if
we were subpoenaed, we don’t
have the names of the students
in every organization, only their
officers.”

Dr. Kurtzman felt. that if stu-
dents “have any complaint, they

could meet through Student Gov- —

crnment.” He _ pointed out that
the issue at hand “is not a ques-
tion of student affairs, but a mat-
ter of opinion.”

On the students’ ‘right to dis-
agree, Dr. Kurtzman emphasized,
“T-hey have a perfect right and I

takelno offense, but for me to

see anyone who disagrees with
me is an‘ impossible task and I
think it’s an unreasonable re-
quest.” ‘ ’

the next year’s editor might not‘
have the funds. The Pitt News
now is only better than having
ﬁve or six bulletins boards around
the campus -because this way the
readers can read through all the
wonderful advertising without
which this forum of commercial
propaganda would fold up in its
sedimentary and die.

But in returning to the ap-
proved-for-the-Pitt readership ar-
ticle, one cannot pass off student

apathy as beneﬁcial for the stu-
dents because of I suppose their
studies and for the university be-

cause of I suppose the necessary '

administrative functions. There

is unfortunately no clear line be-
tween where the administrative
functions end and active partici-
pation, learning, and experience

begins. To advocate refraining
from joining a political party in-
stead of student activism and
thinkism and trial and errorism
and to advocate errorism and to
advocate being “reasonably in-
formed” instead of enthusiastic
digging so that the hard facts and
problems can emerge instead of
the opposing ideological crusades,
is to call for students to behave
like scared~ ostriches and stick

   

their heads in the sand.

So, there's going to be friction
on the university where the learn-
ing is free and pursued enthusi-
astically, and if some students
don’t like the commotion, let
them go to the library instead of
demanding astiﬂing and steriliz-
ing peace and quiet when a little
conﬂict occurs, because not all
students are ostriches by nature.

It’s trade-in time

for tired old myths.

Like the one about business. Especially
big business. That it is beyond the ‘rugged
individualist’s wildest daydream to enter
this holy of holies because he’ll lose some-
thing that’s very sacred—like his inde-
pendence. ‘ i

Sure, it can happen. If a, guy or gal
wants to hide, or just get by, or not accept
responsibility, or challenges.

We’re not omniscient enough or stupid
enough to speak for all business, but at a

company like Western Electric, bright '

ideas are not only welcome, they are en-
couraged. And no door is shut. Create a
little stir, go ahead, upset an old apple-
cart (we replace shibboleths at a terriﬁc

these wry words of Oliver Wendell

Holmes? “Never trust a_ .generality— not

even this one.”
‘ That’s how we feel about the generality
that claims you’ll just become a little cog

. in a company like Western Electric. You

might, of course, but if you consider your-
self an individual. now, odds are 10 to 1
that you’ll keep your individuality. And
cherish it. And watch it grow. Even at big,
big Western Electric.

You know, that’s the only way we’d

want you to feel. If you feel like coming -

WAC Offers Program

 For College Women

The United States Women’s Army Corps offers a new
Army Student Program to those college women interested

in _ in an education with pay.

The new program for Potential WAC Officers offers
participants $317 mailed to them each month during their
senior year in college. However, they are under no obliga-

"tion to participate in military

training or activities and may
use their stipend as they choose.

Upon graduation, participants
are commissioned as second lieu-
tenants in the active Army with.
a two-year commitment to serve.

Young women applying for the
Army Student Program must be

4 . between 19 and 28 years of age,

unmarried and with no depen-
dents./They must also be enroll‘-
eﬂ as full-time seniors in accred-
ited colleges or universities and
pursuing bachelor's degrees in
one of the major ﬁelds useful to
the Army. A

In addition, they must have
successfully completed the Col-
lege‘ Junior Program. For this
program, college women must be

" R between 18 and 30, unmarried

and with no dependents, and ex-
pecting to complete their junior
year or the ﬁrst semester of their
senior year of college this spring.

Frosh Handbook

 Needs Editors

The Office of Student Publica-
tions, 406 SU, is accepting appli-
cations for the position of edi-
tor and business manager of the
Polaris, the freshman handbook.
Application forms may be picked
up at 405 SU.

The executive committee for
Polaris will meet at 2 p.m. Fri-
.c’.ay, Feb. 10, in 406 SU to select
the editor and business manager
for the coming year.

 

Under this program the women
are offered a four-week “vacation
with pay” while looking over 03/-
reer opportunities in the WAC’s.

In the summer between their
junior and senior years, these
women attend a month-long
course at Fort McClellan. Those
selected for this College Junior
Program receive free transporta-
tion to and from Fort McClellan
and their room and board while
there. In addition, the Army
gives them a “salary” of over
$160 to do with as they please.

Upon completion of the Junior
program there is no obligation to-
further military service, but in
the future a commission as sec-
ond lieutenant is available.

Student Creativity Stressed

Computer Seminar Planned

Most courses taught at a uni-
versity are surveys of what other
men, sometimes hundreds of
years in the past, have done. The
students busy themselves with
study and memorization. How-
ever, the Library _Science Depart-
ment is planning a new Graduate
Seminar which will devote itself
fully to the development of new
techniques of information re-
tiieval as the actual course our-
riculum

The course is LS 360. It will
be offered in the Spring term
under the direction of Associate
Professor Jack Belzer and Pro-—
fessor Allen Kent. It will be
open to advanced and doctoral
students, who must have the per-
mission of the instructors to en-
roll, because of the level of com-
petence required of the students.
The course will be entirely cre-
ative.

Professor Belzer, in comment-
ing on the plans, emphasized the

importance of this type of course.
“We (the University are_ more
advanced that anyone else in the
country in the instruction of

computer techniques. This repre— .

sents the most modern approach
to conversational modes now be-
ing‘ planned.”

Professors Belzer and Kent are.

hoping that the seminar will re-
sult in the application of Pitt In-
terpretive Language (PIL) via
remote console systems connect-

- ed with IBM 360/50 to the prob-

lems of cataloguing and retriev-
ing data such as references to
articles in technical journals and
speciﬁc topics within general sci-
entiﬁc works.

Sign-up sheets are now up op-
posite room 505 in the NASA
building, in the American Insti-
tute of Research, or at the Know-
ledge Availability Systems office.
lnterested students should plan
to sign these’ sheets by Feb. 22,
so that plans for the development
of the seminar can be completed.

   Cagers In Final Lap, Visit

 

Unbeaten Hurdlers Seek
Varsity Indoor Records

by DAN LICHTENSTEIN
At this point in the season, the track team consists of
winning athletes on a losing team. The team has been beaten
58-42 and 74-26. But in the midst of‘ these drubbings five

varsity and Field House records have been‘broken by four athletes.

Another record will probably drop soon. Juniors Tom Christie
and Dave Brinn have ﬁnished one, two in the 60-yard high hurdles
in both meets, and Christie is now just a tenth of a second behind
the record with Brinn a tenth of a second behind him.

Brinn is more conscious of the record. “We’re getting down every
week.” He has gone from a 7.9 to a 7.7 in the meets. “We’re both
shooting for the record of 7.5.”

This tall, thin boy from nearby Peabody High never ran until
his senior year in high school. Then he placed fourth in the city
in the 120-yard high hurdles. After an idle sophomore year, he earned
a full scholarship here with hard work and ambition.

“Tom and I are both capable of a 7.4.” But Brirm is even more
enthusiastic about the outdoor record, the Penn Relays and the
ICAAAA meet in New York. Coach Jim Banner believes Brinn’s fu-
ture as a runner is unlimited; Dave’s conﬁdence and ambition cer-
tainly indicate his own faith in the future.

Christie is more quiet and almost vague about his own success.
But the conﬁdence is there. Against Kent State, he set a Field House
record in the broad jump, he ﬁnished third in that event last week,
and is undefeated in the hurdles.

Christie gives the impression he doesn’t even_ know the record
exists. When reminded of it, he concedes that tying it is within reach.
“We could tie it anyway. With three more meets and the right com-
petition, it’s Possible.”

Banner gives Christie more than just the possibility of a new
record. “Tom can do a 7.4 with very little trouble.” He credits Chris-
tie’s almost perfect form for his success. “Of the three hurdlers,
Tom has the least speed, but the best form. They are all in real good
shape, but it’s Tom’s form that_puts him ahead of the others.”

Banner adds, “Don’t forget Paul Lambert.” Lambert is a fast
and versatile senior who is running behind Christie and Brinn for
the moment. He and Roger Ho-lly will join the two juniors to make
the shuttle relay team for the Penn Relays in April. .

Banner, Brinn and Christie, it sounds like a Vaudeville team.
But they’ve been putting on an unbeatable show so far, and they’re
bound to cut a few records before they’re ﬁnished.

Hoover Likes Pairing  

Football With Wrestling

by ROY JACOBS

The days of the two sport athlete seem to have disap-
peared from college athletics. Years ago someone like Dick
Groat would be a basketball All-American but go on to play
major league baseball. More recently, Jim Nance was an

NCAA wrestling champion but is now a football star.
But the high pressure of col-

lose time from studying. I do it

legiate academics has all but _ ”
eliminated the two season ath— beﬁlause I bk‘? with SP°:S‘e on a
lete from the sports scene. But Oover’ a Jumor’ is er

wrestling scholarship from Cur-
wensville High. He played foot-
ball all through high school but
concentrated on wrestling here
until an assistant coach invited
him out for football last spring.

Since then he’s been a two
sport athlete.

The surprising thing is that his
wrestling coach doesn't mind Ter-
ry’s football aspirations.

“I’m all for it,” says Dave
Johnson. “The more athletic ex-
posure he has, the more confi-
dence in his own ability and the
more physical development. I
don’t worry about his getting hurt
—you can get hurt doing any-
thing.” Terry agrees.

“Playing football helped me

not in Terry Hoover’s case.

Hoover spent his fall after-
noons with Dave Hart this year
as a linebacker, and he currently
is the leading varsity wrestler,
competing at 191. And nobody
had to twist his arm.

“I like it,” says Terry. “It nev-
er gave me much. trouble in high
school, and it keeps me on a
schedule here. The time I spend
practicing would probably be
wasted anyway. If it bothered
my studies, I'd drop one.”

There are a few other athletes
out for more than one sport, but
Hoover. thinks there could be
some more.

“With the situation this school
is in for athletes, we need them

here,” he explains. “There are
two or three guys on the football
team who could help the wrest-
ling team.

“Some guys don’t want to put
the time in. They think they’ll

agility-wise. It gives me a start
for getting in shape. It helps me
moving on the mats.” But he
adds, “It hurt me conditioning-
wise, coming out a month late.”

Hoover played football at 210
pounds and last year wrestled

heavyweight. He has since drop- “

ped to 191.

“It was my own idea. I drop-
ped because I didn’t like wrest-
ling big guys. I thought I had a
better chance at 191’. We need a
real big guy to wrestle heavy-
weigh .”

Tonight the wrestlers meet Cor-
nell at Ithaca, N. Y., and Terry
faces a relatively inexperienced
191-pounder. The rest of the'Big
Red is well-balanced‘ and the
match should bea close_one.-

 

  
  
 

Cats Battle’
Local Boy
Hank South .

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Assistant Sports Editor

The Panther Basketball
team opens themonth of
February at ‘Cornell tonight
and if the cagers follow their
regular pattern, they will lose
more games than last year’s 5-17
squad.

Currently sporting a 4-12 rec-
ord, the Panther quintet won two
games of eight in December and
had an identical mark in Jan-
uary. Coach Bob Timmons is
among the ﬁrst. to note that
Ithaca isn’t the easiest place to
start to reverse the trend.

The Big Red of Cornell are
11-3 for the season. They have
lost once at home, and that was
a 66-65 squeaker to Syracuse.
Among their victims is Kentucky,
by 92-77 in Lexington. Cornell
has also trounced Columbia, 74-
40, in an ECAC game of the
week. That’s the same Columbia
that‘ won this year’s Steel Bowl
Tournament, outlasting the Pan-
thers in the process, 69-57.

Two sophomores and a junior
have made Cornell contenders for
the ‘Ivy League championship.
Hank South of Pittsburgh’s South
Hills Catholic and Walt Esdaile
of New Haven’s Hillhouse High
have provided coach Sam Mac-
Neil with strength up front that
he didn’t have ‘last year.

The two heralded sophomores
support Gregg Morris, Corne1l’s
leading ‘set:-er',‘ who is averaging
better than 21 points a game.
Timmons has nothing but praise

interest in Panther basketball if the coach

would provide them with some reason for
caring. P i
, Paul Birch former All-American from Duquesne, re-
A cently said that Pittsburgh is a high school town. “They
 love their local heros,” he said, inferring that nobody cares
about Pitt basketball.
- There is a ring of truth in what Birch says. About the
only people outside the immediate college community who
follow the Panthers’ losing streak are the local penny-ante
gamblers. _
-"_ « Currently within the University, more people are atten-
tive-to the football recruiting program than to the upcom-
ing basketball game. At last Satu-rday’s swimming meet,
the crowd was more vocal than any hoops crowd to date-.

Even when the Panthers win, they have been criticized
for taking the excitement out of the game.
. . In response to this criticism, Timmons said,;“0ur boys
aren't naturally aggressive. They're not the type of ball
. , players that will scramble for the ball. You can’t just change
their habits overnight. We don’t have the depth to concen-
‘trate on this in practice.

. “At some colleges, they roll and ball down the court and
send two boys out after it. ‘We can’t afford to do that and
risk an injury.” ‘

‘ Red Manning, Duquesne’s coach, disagrees,

.- “The gbod athlete is ‘naturally aggressive, It’s instinc-
tive that they will go for the loose ball. If a boy is on the
fringe of being a good athlete, then the ball will come off
the boards, hit him in the hands, bounce out of bounds or
into the hands of the opposition. You can’t teach a boy to
!be, an aggressive ballplayer. If he’s an athlete he will be
naturally.”

: ‘ . Veiled behind Manning’s-retort was the implication that
‘i. Pitt doesn’t have any really good basketball players. 'I‘im-
__mons would probably agree. _ _

. I The responsibility for what is here, however, rests with
' Timmons. If he expresses dissatisfaction with himself. Re-

cruiting is the key to college sports.

 The pressure of. recruiting is greatest in football. Be-
cause.of numbers, it should be that much less with basket-
ball. But it wasn’t until Tim Grgurich was hired that some
bright new faces began to appear. What’s more disturbing
‘are the stories about the ballplayers that got away.

I It was reported severial years ago how Jack Marin al-

to establish a tradition. Then would have been the easiest
period to attract the outstanding basketball players. In-

bine to equal 1963’s victory production.

 Charlie Hunt Expects
I To Strengthen Himself,
Next Season’s Varsity

by MIKE BROURMAN
Once a year the high schools of Indiana box the state’s
major exports and send them all over the country. The
boxes arrive at college campuses where gleeful basketball
coaches open them to find inside their stars of the future.
Until recently, this has been one of the few major col-

leges left off the Indiana mailing
list. But, as frosh coach and re-
cruiter Tim Grgurich said, “In-
diana’s where the ballplayers
are.” So .this year, the Hoosier
state graciously sent along not
one, but two of its valuable ex-
ports.

One is Rob McFarland, a 6’5”
forward who helped Michigan
City to the Indiana state chain-
pionship last year. The other is
Charlie Hunt.

All of this year’s crop of fresh-
men are being counted on to
strengthen next year’s varsity.
But, none will have to carry a.
heavier share of the load than
Charlie Hunt.’ Says coach Bob
Timmons, “He’s going to have to
take LaValley’s place.” And then
Timm-ons adds that “Jim has
been our steadiest and most con-
sistent ballplayer.”

Timmons believes that Hunt
can do the job. “He’ll be stronger
than Jim was as a sophomore.
Charlie has played a lot mo-re
basketball. In Indiana, that’s
their sport.” But Timmons and
Grgurich both know that Hunt
has a long way to go.

“He has got to Work on his ball
handling and his shooting. He
should have a hook shot from
the low post. He’s big enough to
use it.” Tim Grgurich has Brian
Generalovich -and Daryl Ruby,
former Panther stars, working
on his inside moves and on the
hook.

And then there is defense.
"Most freshmen are weak in
that,” explains Timmons. “They
have to learn to help out in there,
to pick up the loose man, and
to play the ball.”

Hunt agrees with his coaches
that improvement is needed.

“Basically, I think I have to work
on my moves from underneath,
and especially, I have to work
on my strength.”

Back in Greenﬁeld, 7 Indiana,
Char1ie’s strength was never a
problem. “I was always as big
as the guy I was playing against,
and he was never any stronger.”
But, here, it has been different.
Playing against the West Vir-
ginia freshman, Hunt was intro-
duced to muscle basketball by
Dennis Peterson.

“That guy was really strong
underneath. He pushed me out of
there pretty good.” That has
made Hunt determined to add
some more muscle to his 6’7”
frame. “After the season is over,
I’m going to workout with weights
to built up my strength. I hope
to put on 10 or 15 pounds.”

It will not be an easy task
for Hunt to accomplish all which
he has set out for himself to do,
but if Panther basketball im-
proves next year, then Charlie
Hunt will have to be partially
responsible.

It took awhile, four telephone
calls and three visitors within 15
minutes to be exact, but head
football coach Dave Hart ﬁnally
signaled timeout on his over-
burdened schedule to illuminate
on his recruiting program.

A recruiting program which
began long before last season
ended, which witnessed Hart"s
dynamic staff scouting many high
school games and viewing the
ﬁlms of many more. And which
culminated in the signing-up of
some top-ﬂight scholastic talent.

Since December 1, 1966, there
have been 13 players recruited
for the 1967 freshman football
team. However, this is technical-
ly.

“Actually we have 20 boys now
committed and a dozen more we
have a good chance to get,” said
Hart just before the phone rang.

Under agreement with Penn
State, West Virginia, and Syra-
cuse, Hart is allowed 100 schol-
arships over a four-year period.
He plans to use 32 of them this
campaign.

For most of the highly rated
1303's, Hart had to compete with
Penn State recruiters who do
quite a job in the central and
eastern part of Pennsylvania.

“We’re beating them on a few
kids,” Hart said. “They’ve beaten
us to only one boy that I know
of but I don’t know how many
more they’ll get before it’s over.

“In the Penn State case, par-

ticularly since we’re ﬁghting for
the same boys, I think we’ve got
more of them,” Hart said. “Com—
pared to Notre Dame, were
even.”

With a few exceptions, Hart
has concentrated his program in
Pennsylvania. He and his staff
has covered over 6,000 miles, us-
ing every minute of the day re-
cruiting.

Hart Hustles “Blue Chippers”

“That’s all we’re doing,” Hart
said. “It’s tough, boy it's tough.”

Compared to his first year, Hart
said his program is “way ahead
of last year's pace. We didn’t
have 20 at this time last year,
but we still have the same old
admission problem. A lot of them
can’t get in. We lose them and
they get in elsewhere.”

Dear Mr. Bymanzl

Through much ‘current student thinking about
business runs a rebellion against the prospect of
knuckling under to a corporate mold. A smart
company will welcome this attitude (though the _

A  . same smart company will distinguish between an

individual with creative ideas and a malcontent
with a chip on his shoulder).

I 7WYou put the matter this way: The ”distinguishing

' mark’ of the businessman is ”sameness.” Mark ,-
Belnick at Cornell feels corporate use of personality
tests ”destroys any attempt at convincing students
that business is truly interested in them as
individuals.” Harvard's Jim Hill says students want
to keep the ”sense of individuality and creativity”

1. .ji_wh’ich a college education nurtures.

‘ .Fr0m the‘University of Illinois, Bob Byman asks why,

.  if business does indeed offer opportunities for

individuality, people do not know of it. Ed Kokalas

 at Michigan State writes about ”the square peg in the

_ square hole” and Larry Warner of the University of

l- Texas speaks of ”being lost in the corporate crowd.”

5 ,

, __Across all these comments falls the ghostly shadow

‘ of a stereotype.

_. JA writer friend of mine used to give a wind_-up toy to
‘leach child every Christmas. Now that his children
are grown, they give one to him. This year's toy was

 l_ a little tin man in a business suit, complete with

wind-up key in his back.
jalsn’t this how some_students see Mr. Average
f Businessman? Clockwork and hollow. . . no mind
' of his own . . .wind him up and away he hops, just

like all his brothers from the same production line.
Drive? Certainly. Values? Never!

_ Some of today's thinking and writing about ”the
— businessman’? has just about as much resemblance
to real life as this toy has. The more we cut through

 - the fictional or unreal part of the gray flannel and

” -organization man talk (while we listen to and benefit

.i.“",Afr'om the rest of it), the better off both businessman
'* ‘and college man will be.

Behind any folk myth is at least enough fact to
keep it alive. Joe Colleges and‘Absent-Minded
Professors do exist; so do Dizzy Blondes and
Organization Men. But all blondes aren't dizzy
and all businessmen aren't robots. We must sort
fact from fancy andact accordingly.

Here is the crux of this ”conformity” question!
Does or does not business try to make people into
wind-up robots? The answer: Any company which
tries to do'th‘is or does not try to prevent it from
happening is not a smart company.

This is how Crawford H. Greenewalt, chairman
of the ‘lO0,000—emp|oyee DuPont organization,
spoke of this in The Uncommon Man,

The Individual in the Organization: I

The alert and well—managed organization will be
fully aware of the dangers associated with individual
submersion. Progress will be made in direct
proportion to the intellectual freedom of action
given all the menon the team. There is nothing
inherent in large organizations which closes the
door to high individual performance, but the larger
the organization, the more assiduously it must work
at the job of keeping its channels of encouragement
and recognition open and flowing.

In the preface to this book, Columbia University's
Courtney C. Brown points up the distinction between

“debilitating conformity of thought” and”rati'onal
. conformity of behaviour within the bounds of

commonly accepted purpose.”

Would you buy this? I do, because I believe success
and fulfillment come to men who innovate, engineer,
develop, invent, create; to men who interact as
individuals with other individuals, each bringing
unique backgrounds and insights to bear on a
common problem.

How much ”cult of the organization man" do you
think there might be in a stock exchange? Listen.

The Midwest Stock Exchange used to be just an
apparently comfortable carbon copy of the New
York Stock Exchange. When it realized it was in a
rut, it hired a 44-year-old stockbroker named

James E. Day as president. His challenge: to develop

completely new and independent ideas, to build
a meaningful and major exchange.

His first change was to allow corporations as well

as partnerships to join the exchange. This had never
been done anywhere. ”C|earing by mail" was

Day's next innovation. This let out—of-town firms
deal directly with the exchange and improved the
service these firms could give their customers. The
exchange next pioneered by installing a computer
center to do the bookkeeping for member firms.

Note here that the organization—a stock exchange-
specifically welcomed radical innovations. Note
also that three ”industr,y firsts” resulted—and the
New York Stock Exchange has since adopted the first
two and is developing the third. Midwest volume
grew from $109 million to four billion dollars

in the process.

. Would you expect to find ”organization-ism” in

a public utility? But Illinois Bell Telephone Company,
for example,— consciously and constantly——even

. systematical|y—encourages its employees to question

every system it has (from the customer's point
of view), to ask why iris the way it is, to find
ways to make it better.

Probe any successful organization and you will find
attitudes like those in these two examples. They

are what make theworld go. Business benefits from
individual creativity working in-and through rational
conformity of behaviour. So does society. So do you.
