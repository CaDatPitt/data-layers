Like many
Pitt stuclents,
Corey
Appleby feels
Oakland is a
safe enough
place that
student
escorts such
as Jocelyn
Keer are not
necessary to
help him get
home in one
piece.

Is safety cl concern?

 

The impression that Oakland is an
unsafe place to live has ﬁltered down through
the generations of Pitt students for years, but
that impression seems to have changed —— for
the better.

In a Pitt News informal survey, most stu-
dents said they aren’t concerned about the
.area’s “rough” reputation, and this is evident
in the low usage of programs like the escort
service and Van Call.

“South Oakland is OK. Ifl have to walk
alone, I will. I feel safe,” said Vicki Shen, a
South Oakland resident.

The future of the escort service is in
question, and administrators say they don’t
think the program should continue if students
don’t use it. ,

At a “town hall meetin ” in Benedum

auditorium Monday, Bob Harkins, director of
parking and transportation, said the escort ser-
vice does nothing to ﬁx safety problems.

Since the service patrols such a small
area, Harkins said the money could be better
spent on permanent solutions on the area,
such as better police patrol.

“Having two people walk someone back
and forth between the library and Towers tells
me that if the area is that dangerous, maybe
we should focus the money we’re spending
on the escort service on cleaning up that sec-
tion,” said Harkins.

He also said the money could be better
spent in programs that more students use.

“We could put the money being spent on
the escort service into programs that are more
successful like Van Call or the shuttle ser-
vice,” he said.

While students feel the area is safe, and

cost students big bucks

When big business created monopo-
lies in the early half of the century, the U.S.
government formed anti-trust legislation.
When Pitt does it, students end up paying
for it. '

Pitt distributes a manual telling student
groups how they can spend their allocation
money, and it also tells them where they
can spend it.

This policy is enforced by the student
activities Allocations Committee and, ulti-
mately, the Student
G o v e r n m e n t

But some mer-
chants Pitt patron-
izes charge twice as much as other busi-
nesses providing the same service.

For example, the regular rate at Media
Services for an item such as a 180-minute
VHS tape is $18, while most stores only
charge about $4. The day rate for a video
projector is $100.

The Allocations Committee monitors
the funding that campus organizations
receive, assuring that they run under these
terms outlinedin the 1996 SGB Allocations
and Operations Manual for Certiﬁed
Student Organizations .

This year, the committee is in charge
of overseeing $447,000 which has been,
and will continue to be, distributed among
over 120 campus organizations.

If an organization wants to use their

student allocations fee funding, goods and
services must be purchased through specif-
ic University channels and entities.

“We are extremely limited in what
[requests] we can approve,” said Noelle
Carnpagna, the Allocations Committee
chair.

Simple but important services to orga-
nizations such as printing, travel, equip—
ment rental, and catering must all be
obtained through the agencies listed in the
manual to be eligible for reimbursement.

According to the allocations manual,
“all on—carnpus food services must be pro
vided through
University cater-
ing” for a student
organization to be
approved for cater-
ing funding by the Allocations Committee.

Likewise, all printing projects must be
submitted to Central Printing in the
Cathedral of Learning, and all media
equipment rentals must be made through
Media Services. \ A

“These contracts that we have through
the University are, in theory, supposed to
get us cheaper rates through lots of busi-
ness,” said Joyce Giangarlo, associate
director of student activities. “At least that’s
the theory of it.”

Giangarlo said that student groups
rarely get those cheaper rates.

Student organizers are upset because
the required agencies are often more
expensive than their off-campus competi-

UNITED NATIONS — The United
States yesterday vetoed the re-election
of United Nations Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros—Ghali. He won re-
election by a 14 - 1 vote by the 15-
member Security Council.

The U.S. is one of only five per-.

manent members of the council that
have Veto power in the council; the
others are China, Russia, France, and
Britain. Senior U.S. officials say the
reason for the veto is that the only way
to persuade the Republican Congress
to pay the $1.5 billion the U.S. owes
the United Nations is to replace
Boutros—Ghali.

Black Action Society president Janera Solomon, at Monday's wn hall meeting.

 

”OicIc:fo” guides BAS
president Janera Solomon

 

Janera Solomon is trying to make
Pitt’s Black Action Society move to the
beat of a diﬁerent drummer.

As the second largest organization on
campus, which has over 2,000 members,
this seems to be quite a task. But for
Solomon, the president of the BAS, it
doesn’t appear to be something that she
and her administration cannot handle.

Solomon comments on the problems
with the past leaders of the BAS and talks
of how she is taking it upon herself and
her administration to change the student
body’s perception of the organization.

“We are changing it from one that was
simply run by a ‘clique of friends’ to one
that brings together students from very
diverse backgrounds, to work together
closely on a common cause,” Solomon
said. I

The causes she puts high on her list of
“things to do” are increasing student
awareness and participation in the BAS
and increasing the level of student com-
munity activities.

Creighton Moorehead, the vice presi-
dent, agrees. “[BAS] needed an image
change this year, particularly in trying to
bridge the gaps which exist among our-
selves.

“The good thing about Janera is that

~ she has been with the BAS for four years,

and she knows what has gone wrong in
the past. She holds nothing back when
noting the areas that are in need of
improvement to the new committee
chairs.”

Ironically, Solomon was originally
reluctant to run for the office. It wasn’t
until she ﬁnally succumbed to the insistent
urging of her peers that she decided to take
the office. It ultimately came down to her
realization of knowing the organization
better than anyone else and possessing the

necessary leadership skills to run it.

Solomon drives this year’s adminis-
tration on her belief that “in the United
States, if you are not informed, you can’t
participate in the political process proper-
ly.” This is evident in her own decision-
rnaking processes as well.

“Janera needs to know every detail
when making a decision,” said
Moorehead, a quality which he strongly
believes makes a good president.

Solomon, 21, is a senior economics
and self-designed major who focuses
extensively on Caribbean studies — par-
ticularly its history and culture. This is an

interest which comes naturally, since she

is a native of Guyana, the only English
speaking country in South America.
Solomon lived in Guyana until the age of
10. It was then that her mother, father, and

0 three younger sisters moved to the United

States.

So how does a South American
native, whose farnily’s livelihood is gener-
ated from the crafting and selling of steel
drums, end up in Pittsburgh? Solomon
said Pittsburgh was a natural place to set-
tle because she had’ an uncle who lived
here to attend the University of Pittsburgh.

It is obvious the Solomon family ties are.

quite strong. Her office cabinet is covered
with more that a dozen photos of family
members and friends.

“What I’ve found most challenging,”
says Solomon, “is making sure we have a
team that is working on the same page,
and to make sure we reach the goals that
we set together.”

In fact, the sweatshirt she wears reads
“ofaafo.” In giving it a first glance the
logo is ‘confusing. Solomon clariﬁes this
when she says, ‘‘It stands for one for all;
all for one,” as she proudly displays the
shirt made by her friend’s clothing com-
pany,. a motto Solomon seems to take seri-
ously in the daily beat of life as president
of the BAS.

tors. This fact has been brought
to the attention of the allocations
board, but they say there’s little
they can do to change the poli-
cy.

“It’s unfair, but we are lim-
ited to University services even
if they happen to be more
expensive,” said Campagna.
“I’ve been told by others ‘that’s
just the way it.is.”’

Since many of these agen-
cies are either University-
owned or afﬁliated, Pitt is able
to cycle these costs and proﬁts
through itself at the expense of
students.

a If the service an organiza-
tion needs to purchase isn’t

obtained through the businesses
speciﬁed in the allocations man-
ual, then the organization may
ﬁnd itself reaching into its own
pockets to pay.

“I’ve had to print items that

only cost 75 cents each at Sir.

Speedy down on Forbes, but
$1.50 each at Central Printing,”
said Giangarlo. “If we take it to
Sir Speedy, it won’t get
approved on the funding request
and we’re stuck with the bill.”

Printing is not the only
more expensive “option” for
Pitt organizations.

Media Services does not
provide a discount unless the
student group is part of an acad-

 

emic center such as CAS or
CGS. According to the manual,
the group must apply “only for
instructional support events that
do not charge an admission
fee.”

This means the organiza-
tion can only get a discount if
they use it for a free academic or
public service event —-— purely-
social events get nothing.

Many events don’t meet
this criteria for a discount, and
the organization can ﬁnd itself
paying the much higher regular
rate, which then comes out of
their budget and, ultimately, out
of the student activities fee.

“[Members of SGB] have

FROM PAGE I

already been working on this
problem and trying to make the
University accountable and
match prices  but so far they
have met with no success,” said
Campagna.

This policy also makes it
necessary for student groups to
either use all of their funds, or
lose them at the end of the year.

If organizations don’t
spend their entire allocation by
the end of the ﬁscal year (June

-30) any unspent or uncommit-

ted ﬁmds are withdrawn ﬁom
the organization and funnelled
back into the SGB accounts for
emergency expenditures in the
fall.

Sallade-Farina and members of her

streets a little safer for the South
Oakland residents.

Pittsburgh City Police ofﬁcers
have even said they think the
Oakland area is much safer than the
old rumors suggest.

“I think you will ﬁnd that it’s
relatively safe to walk around in
South Oakland,” said Commander
Ed Kelly of Pittsburgh’s Zone 6
Police Department which has juris-
diction over South Oakland. “In the
early moming hours anyone is vul-
nerable and I’d advise them to walk
in groups. But it’s generally a very
safe area.”

Pitt Police officers, who often
assist the Pittsburgh Police, said
most problems in Oakland are
caused by students, not outsiders.

“Problems I’m familiar with in
the area usually stem from a number
of parties that take place,” said Pitt
Police Chief Rick Boyd.

"as:-5

 
   

 

«'3 FROM PAGE 2 2?"

Boyd said most assaults are a
direct result of drunk students who
either become involved in a ﬁght or
sexually assault someone behind
closed doors.

“In South Oakland, it’s not a
matter of people lurking behind
bushes and women being pounced
upon and assaulted,” Boyd said.

Boyd also said that all the
assaults reported to campus police
in the past three years have been
date or acquaintance rape situations.

Commander Kelly agreed
about the incidents reported to the

' city police.

“I think the trend of low use of
the [escort service] will continue,”
said Cortese.

With streets that are perceived
to be safe by students and statistics
to back up those perceptions, the
escort service may be in for a rough,
but very short, ride.

Foods

One of the major reasons stu-
dents ﬁnd the closing of Eddie’s on
the weekends inconvenient is that
Eddie’s offers options to use blocks
that would otherwise be lost at the
end of the week. Milk, fruit, lunch
meat, and cakes can be bought as an
alternative to losing two blocks, or
$900 worth of food.

Schenley Cafe, during certain

VIP safely is a special concern

«.9. ~: -- .:-,.. .1:-.~:~c ...-.

Aside from the everyday duty
of maintaining a safe campus for
nearly 26,000 students, the Pitt
Police often extend extra effort to
provide protection for the many
dignitaries who visit the University.

In the past few years, Pitt has
been host to many VIP speakers
including last fall’s visit by Vice
President Al Gore.

In most instances, the Pitt
Police provide the necessary secu-
rity according to the guest’s popu-
larity, importance, and controver-
sial issues surrounding them For
Gore, Pitt Police were needed to
assist the Secret Service,‘ who
accompanied the vice—president
everywhere he went.

When Gore delivered his
speech on the Cathedral Lawn,
every campus ofﬁcer was
patrolling the area, according to Pitt
Police Chief Rick Boyd.

At least 50 ofﬁcers were
spread within the shadow of the
Cathedral, including a man who
was stationed in the spire on top of
the Heinz Chapel, scanning the
entire area with binoculars.

Gore’s personal protection
was provided by his own body-
guards, while the Pitt Police were

to control the perimeter, including
the crowd and surrounding areas.

The City Police also lent a
hand by controlling traffic ﬂow.
When the president or vice—presi-
dent travels by ground, all roads the
motorcade will travel on are closed
until he passes, Boyd said.

“As a general rule, everything
stops when the president or vice-
president is in town,” Boyd said.

In addition to sarne—day secu-
rity, the White House sends an
advance team several weeks before
the event Every ﬂoor and every
room of the Cathedral was individ-
ually searched with the help of
bomb-snifﬁng dogs.

“When a VIP visits Pitt, hun-
dreds of individuals are involved,
and literally thousands of man-
hours are devoted to devising and
executing a plan,” Boyd said.

Not every guest receives the
undivided attention Al Gore was
favored ‘with.

However, some controversial
speakers are given extra attention,
Boyd said. LAPD Police Chief
Daryl Gates visited Pitt in 1993
amidst the controversy of the
Rodney King beating and its sub-
sequent trials.

“Normally two oﬁicers would
be present, but an extra group of
oﬂicers were assigned to overlook

Gates’ speech ﬁom the rear just in
case anything out of the ordinary
took place,” Boyd said. “Luckily
no violence occurred, although
Gates was shouted down and did-
n’t get to ﬁnish what he was say-
ing.”

Boyd said he’s conﬁdent
about his officers’ abilities when it

comes to devising security strate— .

gres.
“Deputy Chief Gary Moses
and our three detective sergeants
Kathy Shriver, Bart Stack, and
Fran Walsh all have at least 20
years’ experience and have been
through planning, coordination,
and execution of security for VIPs.
They do an excellent job,” Boyd
said

But not every student—spon-
sored event is a main priority
unless security is requested.

Hey you guys, SGB elections
are today - get out and vote

The Student Government Board elections are
today. To vote, each student needs to stop at one of
the polls with his new PittCard. -

Monday and Tuesday, we gave you our endorse-
ments for SGB president ‘and board members. We
hope you found those helpful. Now it is your turn to
make the endorsement for whom you would like to
represent you on campus, to the administration, and
in the community.

It is important for each student in CAS to vote in
the SGB elections. In the past, turnouts for SGB elec-
tions have been extremely low (last year, less than 15
percent of the student population turned out to vote).
The students who chose not to vote lost out on an
opportunity to send a message about what they want
in their leaders. Instead, the message sent was tha
students just don’t care. . '

We all know that this just isn’t true. Many stu-
dents have been ticked—of_f about the new PittCards,
the block system, and registration, among other
things. You have written us letters, and we have print-
ed them. Now is your chance to take direct action for
yourselves. -

The students who serve on SGB are there to rep— .
resent the interests of the student body at the
University of Pittsburgh. If you haven’t attended any
of the debates or met the candidates and want to know
more about who is running and what they stand for,
pick up a copy of The Pitt News. We have been run-
ning stories concerning the candidates and SGB elec-
tions since last Monday. ‘ '

As students of this University, it is our duty to go
out and vote. Quit sitting around campus and com-
plaining about the University. Grab your PittCard and
head out to the polls. .

Some problems don’t just disappear

 

He was a. smooth talker. He

was a criminal in the deepest
sense of the word: a manipulator,
an egotist with a deep disrespect
for everything and everyone who
stood in the way of his fulﬁlling
his own disgusting agenda. His
name: Adolf Hitler.

His adversary was an older
man of aristocratic birth, a man
who waited a decade for the rest
of the world to wake up and
smell the coffee, a man who pub-
lished over a million words of
newspaper articles and books of
British history while he was wait-

ing. His name: Winston
Churchill.

In March, 1933, the British
Ambassador in Berlin, Si-r

Horace Rumbold, wrote: “The
new Nazi regime brings out the
worst traits in the German char-

acter, i.e. a mean spirit of ’
revenge, a tendency to brutality,-

and a noisy and irresponsible jin-
goism.” In the heart of Berlin,
there were whippings and club-
bings in every park. Rumbold
sent another dispatch, noting that:
“...the departure of so many writ-
ers, artists, musicians, and politi-
cal leaders has created a vacuum
because they [represented] the
intellectual life of the capital and
all that was original and stimulat-
ing in the world of arts and let-

'ters. Even more disturbing, Jews,

Social Democrats, Communists,
and non-political critics of Nazi
policy are being seized and sent
to large concentration camps

being established in various parts
of country, one .near Munich

(Dachau) being sufﬁciently large V

as to hold 5,000 prisoners.”

One might think that this dis-
patch alone would be enough to
spur the government of Great
Britain to “do something.” They
did. They appointed a new
ambassador. Nobody wanted to
believe, nobody could believe, in
the evil of the illegally rearrning
Germany and the tacit message
of her illegally appointed Fuhrer.

An American journalist in
Berlin, Walter Lippmann, wrote
for the New York Herald Tribune.
On May 19, 1933, he commented
on a speech of Hitler’s as a “gen—

uinely statesmanlike address”.

which provided “convincing evi-
dence of good faith.” He even
went so far as to comment on the
systematic Nazi persecution of
the Jews. He described it as being
“satisfying” to the Germans
because it served a useful pur-
pose in allowing them (the con-
quered, of course, in World War
I) to “conquer somebody,” and it
acted therefore as a “kind of
lightening rod which protects
Europe.” Very generous of
Lippmarm, don’t you think, espe-
cially since he himself was
Jewish.

At the University of Oxford,
the Oxford Students.’ Union pub-
lished the resolution that it
would, “in no circumstances,
ﬁght for King and Country” and
aroused Churchill’s ire. He called
it an “abject, squalid, shameless
avowal.” However, it is typical of

Churchill’s character that he
agreed to speak and answer ques-
tions at the University in 1934.
Among the audience was a young
German, Rhodes scholar, one
Adolf Schlepegrell. His question

» was simple: “Does Mr. Churchill

believe that the German people
were responsible for the war?”
(Meaning, of course, WWI).
Winston looked straight at
Schlepegrell and said “Yes.”
Whereupon the youth turned and
walked out of the lecture amid
tumultuous applause ' from the
other students-. Later in the dis-
cussion, Churchill remarked that
British Rearmament was “essen—
tial for us to be safe in our island
home.” The students’ burst into
laughter; in fact, it became so
loud and raucous that the discus-
sion broke up. '

An interesting and ironic
codicil to this anecdote is that
when Schlepegrell returned to
Germany, planning a law career,
the German authorities found that
his grandmother was Jewish, and
he was therefore disqualified
from taking the bar exam.
Eventually, he became a natural-
ized British citizen and served as
an Intelligence officer during
WWII.

Why am I telling you all
this? Because I think it is curious
how the policy of avoidance of
unpleasant facts and a deterrnina—
tion to avoid confrontation “at all
costs” is a good example of how
to get what you don’t want.

Fourth in a series on Campaign ‘96.

I love it when my predictions come
true.

Two years ago, I wrote in this paper that
President Clinton would be re-elected with
a little bit of help from his enemies. Was I
right, or what?

Things did look pretty bleak for the
president after the 1994 general election
when, thanks to Newt Gingrich and the
gimmickry of the Contract with America,
the GOP swept into power in Congress for
the ﬁrst time in 60 years. No doubt the
Republicans felt that recapturing the presi-
dency, which they felt was their birthright
(and that should tell you why they hate
Clinton so much), was the next step in dom-

~ inating American politics into the next mil-

lennium. »

However, the Republicans made three
crucial mistakes in dealing with the presi-
dent:

1) They underestimated Clinton’s
‘personal popularity. The GOP ﬁgured his
gaffes concerning gays in the  his
ill-fated “economic stimulus package,” and
Hillary’s ' health care reform plan, not to
mention the assorted scandals that have
plagued the Clinton White House, would

give them a good shot atretaking the presi-
dency. To their thinking, he was dead meat.

However, about a year ago, Iran across
a poll taken by the Democratic Party and
published in The Wall Street Journal which
revealed that Clinton’s approval rating never
sank below 40 percent. Anyone who studied
that situation should have ﬁgured that if he
could maintain that rating, he would win.

Vlrrth the traditional issues of crime and
welfare gone (although he admittedly
signed the “welfare reform” bill with a gun
to his head), the political chicanery called
the partial-birth abortion bill having practi-
cally no eifect, and the lack of interest in the
“character” issue (see my Sept. 19 column),
the GOP couldn’t respond. At this point,
only the identity of the sacriﬁcial lamb run-
ning against him was a mystery —— too bad
for Bob Dole. ’

2) They campaigned on principle
and yet tried to play politics at the same

time. That became clear when they tipped

their hands in talking about balancing the
federal budget. Gingrich boldly proclaimed
that they were out to “[defund] the left,” and
Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana added,
“We’re going to ﬁmd what we want to ftmd
and cut what we want to cut.” Translated:
Whatever beneﬁts us is safe.

However, they never thought that the

president would offer his own balanced
budget plan, using their numbers but spar-
ing the programs they targeted for extinc-
tion. Nor did they expect him to reject their

‘budget plan, resulting in two government

shutdowns for which the GOP was widely
blamed. That’s why Gingrich was invisible
during the campaign — that is, except for
Democratic campaign ads. ,

On top of that, as bad as the ‘94 election
turned out for the Democrats, it did birth
Clinton’s political revival, thanks largely to
Harris Wolford.

Harris Woﬁord?

Yeah, the former Senator, whom
favored challenger Rick Santorum barely
held off. The week before the election, the
Woﬂord campaign ran an effective (if
below-the-belt) spot which suggested that
Santorum would raise the Social Security
age requirement.

And voila —— instant issue.

The Democrats only had .to mention
that Republicans, in their rush to slash the
budget, would threaten goverrnnent entitle-
ment programs for senior citizens in the
process — thus the ﬂap over Medicare
funding. Demagoguery again, of course, as
the $270 billion ﬁgure the Democrats threw
out only referred to the cut in the proposed
increase; but it worked, which is why GOP

Christian stronghold is not just on Reps

  

I know I’m probably going to get into
a little hot water for saying this, but here it
is: America is a Christian country. Ninety-
four percent of the American people
believe in god, 91 percent identify them-
selves as a member of a religious faith, and
about half of all Americans pray regularly.

Unfortunately, when many liberals
think of religion and politics, they irnme—
diately jump to negative images like Pat
Robertson’s.Christian Coalition and other
right-wingers who wish to press their
agenda upon America. It is vital that the
Democratic Party makes sure to differenti-
ate the leaders and agenda of the religious
right from those who consider themselves
church—goers. Part of the reason behind the
party’s disastrous melt down in ‘94 and its
resurrection in ‘96 was our perceived hos-
tility toward religious voters. We must, as
a party, rethink some of the negative
impressions we have about religion in
America. _

Are all religious voters Republicans?
No. A poll inThe New York Times in 1994
found that about half of all members of the
religious right consider themselves
Democrats. In the Aﬁican—American com-
munity (generally the voting group that is
most loyal to Democrats), the vast majori-
ty of evangelicals are Democrats. In 1994
Democrats chose to frame the election as a
culture war between the right and main-
stream Americas. The party rhetoric,
unfortrmately, had a distinctly anti-religion

 

tilt. Unsurprisingly, the party got trounced
at the polls big time. In 1996 the party
focused on the main issue of concern to the
American people: the economy. President
Clinton (who himself is a devout Baptist
who often invokes religious themes in his
speeches) was re-elected, and the
Republicans saw their majority in the
House of Representatives reduced heavily.
Religious voters who deserted the party in
1994 came back in 1996. Clearly the sup-
port of religious voters is vital for
Democrats.

Another huge misconception that
Democrats have about church-goers is that
religion itself is a conservativeinstitution.
“Religion in America,” noted French intel-
lectual Alexis de Tocqueville in 1830,
“takes no direct part in the government of
society, but must be regarded as the first of
their political institutions; for if it does not
impart a taste for freedom, it facilitates the
use of it.” Progressive political movements
have used religion to better civil society
since the 19th century. Churches have
founded numerous schools, hospitals, and
spearheaded reforms to make the govem-
ment more responsive to the people. The
abolition of slavery and the civil rights
movement were both launched by reli-
gious leaders like Rev. Martin Luther
King, Jr.

Unfortunately, narrow-minded ideo-
logues like Pat Robertson have used their
own interpretations of the Bible to screen
themselves from criticism and to promote
their own agendas, but the fact is that

Christianity has been a positive force for
helping the disadvantaged, and I certainly
hope it will continue to be. As religious
historian Martin E. Marty of the
University of Chicago commented, “The
prophets teach us to put our religious ener-
gies into the homeless, our relatives in
need, and the poor in gener .”

' As a Democrat, I‘ have to say that
spending our time ﬁghting about cultural
issues makes little sense. Social issues
barely registered at all in the minds of vot-
ers. Author Ben Wattenburg, whose book
“Values Matter Most” was highly praised
by President Clinton, said, “When
Democrats open up the culture war front,
they pay a price. It’s not the Republicans
who are regarded  as the party in opposi-
tion to the death penalty, praying, and
Christmas.” When Michael Dukakis
decided to ﬁght George Bush on frivolous
cultural issues in 1988 instead of the eco-
nomic issues that the majority of American
people cared about, he lost big time, and it
served him right for running such an unfo-
cused carnpaign. The vast majority of
Americans (liberal, conservative, whatev-
er) doesn’t like when their beliefs and val-
ues are infringed upon by the government.

Democrats should follow the advice
Massachusetts Governor Wrlliarn Weld

gave to the 1992 Republican National .

Convention: keep the government out of
people’s wallets and their bedrooms.
Michael Berquist wants to encourage
everyone to rethink their misconceptions
about religion and America.

 
I hate to brag, y'all, but I told you so, two yearsago

strongholds and retiree havens Arizona and

Florida went Democratic.

3) They fought with their right wing
once again. Even with moderate
Republicans’ complaint that conservatives’
passion killed George Bush in 1992, this
year the GOP promoted a party platform
still practically written by Ralph Reed. So to
look less “intolerant,” the Republicans invit-
ed such pro-choice moderates as Colin
Powell and Susan Molinari to speak in
prime time at theconvention.

And naturally, the right then com-
plained about being sold out. The Christian
Action Network’s Martin Mawyer wrote in
The Washington Post, “Dole [lost] because
the GOP presidential ticket [forsook] the
clout of its only populist cause for a series of
Big Tent messages that have all the bang of
a water pistol.” But with Mawyer admitting
that “pro-family, bom-again Christians”
made up only one-third of convention dele-
gates, such a declaration sounds awfully

arrogant, not to mention deluded — espe-

cially in a national race.

What's in
that Notre
Dame water?

 

Gamblers, pay attention.

While your best sources of grid- 1

iron advice are still (and will forev-
er be) The Pitt News Football

Experts, there is one thing you can‘

do to improve your personal prog-
nostication performance: relocate to
South Bend, Ind. If -you stay there
long enough, you may develop the
same ability to see into the crystal
ball of college football that the
local residents have.

Example one: while Lou Holtz
did‘ not announce his resignation
until Tuesday, every breathing

I organism within three blocks of his
' postgame press conference knew

his reign at Notre Dame was over.
Gary Barnett rumors started as early
as Friday. Speculation in the press
box for probable successors was on
before the game ‘started.

His best effort in avoiding the
issue after the game had Holtz
dancing around faster than Gregory
Hines after five cups of coffee.
Everybody saw through it, includ-
ing the out—of—town scribes and
national reporters who had only
been in the area for a day or so.
Holtz should have just shown up at
the conference with a Minnesota
Vikings jacket — he wasn’t fooling
a soul.

Irish fans have a natural sense
for these things. Maybe it’s the
water. Maybe it’s a Catholic phe-
nomenon. Maybe it comes from eat-
ing too much steak (the wait at any
one of the three local steak joints
was quite long — I think‘ George
Gipp’s table is almost ready).

Example two: a South Bend
merchant advertised his Pitt-Notre
Dame prediction on a s_ignboard.

Howard drops Aussies down under

Matt Grove

Vonteego Cummings leads the Panthers with 22 points
intheir win over the Geelong All-Stars last night.

Wednesday, November 20, 1 996

 

The Geelong All-Stars
did everything in their
power last night to upset the
host Panthers but Andre
Howard had something else
in mind.

The sophomore scored
18 points but none were big-
ger than his lay-up at the
buzzer to drop the
Australians 88-86.

With the score tied at 86
and only six‘ seconds
remained, Geelong’s Big
Red Machine Cameron
Dickenson missed a running
jump shot at the foul line.
Kellii Taylor grabbed the
last of his eight rebounds
and fired a pass to Vonteego
Cummings at mid court.
Cummings found Howard
driving towards the basket
and he layed it in as time
expired.

“I was aware of the
clock, I figured that if I at
least tried to lay it up I
would have enough time,”

Howard said following the
game. “If it goes in it goes
1n.’’ -

Howard finished the
game seven of ten from the
field and grabbed 10
rebounds, including seven

offensive.

“Andre didn’t have a
good game the other night
against Marathon Oil, but he
came out the next day and
had the best practice of any-
one on the team,”
Cummings said. “He just
comes out and works hard
and when you come out and
do that good things work out
for you.”

Cummings led the
Panthers with 22 points.
Jason Maile hit four of five
from three—point range and
ﬁnished with 16 points and
Taylor added 14.

When Georgetown jumped out to
a two-games-to-none lead on Sunday,
it looked as if the Hoyas were destined
for a conference tournament bid,

The cross country season is over for
Pitt, ending rather uneventfully last week-
end in Boston’s Franklin Park for the

- District 2 championship meet.

The Eastern College Athletic
Conference and Intercollegiate
Association of Amateur Athletics of
America have the nation divided into eight
districts, which are used to determine who
qualiﬁes for the national championship
meet, held next week in Tucson, Arizona.
No Pitt runners qualiﬁed for nationals.

Two races were run for both women
and men. There is a championship race for
teams trying to get to nationals, and a uni-
versity race for other teams in the district.
Pitt’s men and women ran in their respec-
tive championship races. .

“It was a team decision,” said Pitt
Coach Dave Soba1._ “I posed the question
to them, and they decided to run in the
championship race. Our aspirations are to
compete with the best. You don’t learn
how to do that by shirking the competi-
tion.” 9

The women raced 5,000 meters, as
they have all year. The men went 10,000
meters, or 2,000 more than their usual race
length. 3 j

“I don’t think the extra distance was a
problem for anyone. The men came fully
prepared to run 10,000 meters,” Sobal

‘The comeback victory means
Georgetown will not be attending the

THE PITT NEWS

Pitt’s men ﬁnished 32nd in the com-
bined Disnict 1 and 2 race, which includes
most of the northeastern U.S.

Ed Adamson led Pitt’s men with a
time of 30:50. He finished 78th overall.
Scott Curry was 151st with 31:45. Rich
Walsh had a good performance, 185th in
32:17.

“His time after 8,000 meters was
faster than the 8,000 meters he ran at the
Big East championships two weeks ago,”
Sobal said.

Matt Samuel endured a bloody nose

to finish 206th in 32:38. Matt Homsby

rounded out Pitt’s ﬁnishers with 33:39, in
232nd place.

“Sometimes you just get to a point in
the season where you run out of gas.

That’s what happened to him,” Sobal said.
“That’s part of the adjustment from high
school to the longer distances in college.”

Villanova edged out St. J ohn’s for the
team championship. West Point’s Dan
Brown won the race in 29:28.

Lynda Andros officially had a person-
al record time of 19:16 in 181st place, but
the course was shortened to eliminate
patches of poor footing. Lauren Fittz com-
pleted Pitt’s team, ﬁnishing 220th in
20:34.

It was the last collegiate cross country
race for seniors Adamson and Ellsworth.
They can hold their heads high after this
meet.

“They ran well throughout the season
and very well in the last two meets when
it counted most. They both improved from
the year before, and that’s how it should
be,” Sobal said. “The question now is, ‘did
the rest of the team learn anything?’ If they
did, hopefully we can look for similar
jumps from everyone next year.”

Madison makes historyfor women's soccer

Ned Schano

 

Vanessa Madison has already made
history. \

As the starting center midﬁelder for
the this year’s ﬁrst ever women’s soccer
team, Madison secured her place in his-
tory.
“It was cool we were the first team,”
Madison said. “Everything was new, and
we were all learning. Everyone was at
the same experience level, plus we’ll be
in history as the first team.”

But as the first team, Pitt experi-
enced plenty of growing pains. The Lady
Panthers ended their season last week
with_ a record of 3-16. That record could
be discouraging, but Madison, only a
freshman, found positives.

“The losses built character, and they
made us stronger.” Madison said. “I
knew we had a lot of tough games, but I
really didn’t know what to expect. It’s a
totally different level than we are used
to. It was our first year, and we learned
from it.”

Madison came to Pitt with a solid
understanding of the game. She was part
of Head Coach Roland Sturk’s first—ever

recruiting class
at Pitt, coming
all the way from
Bonita, Calif.
Madison was a
highly—touted
athlete in high
school, earning
11 high school
letters, including

gram at Pitt.

“I thought it
would be cool going to the East Coast,”
Madison said. “It’s been a smooth [tran-
sition]. I really get along with all the
players. We’ve all connected well, and it
helped me adjust to Pitt. Plus, I love all
the travelling.”

Next year, the Lady Panthers will be
doing plenty of travelling‘ as they begin
Big East Conference play. In preparation

their final game.
“I’m definitely
excited for next
year.”

“We’ve experienced a lot this year,”

, Madison noted. “Hopefully our experi-.

ence will carry over next year.”
Experience was something the Pitt
team sorely lacked this year. Pitt had 14
freshmen on the squad and only one
senior, forward Tracy Mascari. Coach
Sturk had a recruiting class of only eight
players this season. The rest of the play-

ers came through preseason tryouts. That
means that a majority of the players were
thrust into starting roles as freshmen.

Before her first collegiate game,
Madison felt some pressure.

“I was pretty nervous,” Madison
said. “It was a whole new level, a higher
level. It’s hard to know exactly what to
expect.”

Madison said she saw quite a change
between high school and college.

“The pace of the game is a lot faster.
The players are bigger and stronger,
especially in the Big East.

Although the Panthers had a poor
record this season, Madison is confident
about next season.

“In the beginning of the season, it
was hard to play together because we
didn’t really know each other,” Madison
reﬂected. “By the end of the season, it
was a lot easier to play together at the
collegiate level. It was easier knowing

‘ what kind of moves to make and play off

each other.”
By next season, the Lady Panthers

. will certainly be prepared after gaining

more experience and having a season
under their belts. And Vanessa Madison
is prepared to lead the charge.

Lou quits from The PM News Sports Briefing

from local and wire services
College Football
- Lou Holtz announced his res-
ignation yesterday from the
most prestigious job in college
football, stepping down as head
coach at Notre Dame, effective
at the end of the season.
Ending a week of specula-
tion, Holtz made the announce-
ment yesterday at South Bend,
saying it was time to make a
change. “It’s the right thing to
do,” Holtz said in a prepared
statement. '
Holtz has a lifetime record
of 99-29-2 and is second to
Knute Rockne on the school’s
all-time victory list. The 59-
year-old Holtz has said he
would rather not break
Rockne’s record of 105 victo-
ries. B
Athletes in trouble with the
law _
0 Former major leaguer Jose
Lind was arrested for reckless
driving Sunday night in Tampa.
Lind was reportedly not
wearing pants when troopers
stopped his Toyota Land

  
 
 

Cruiser. According to Polk
County Florida Police, Lind
had several cans of beer and a
gram of cocaine with him.

Lind was regarded as one
of baseball’s ﬁnest ﬁelding sec-
ond baseman. He played six
years for the Pittsburgh Pirates
from 1987 to 1992 and was a
member of three division-win-
ning teams. Lind also played
for the Kansas City Royals.
Baseball .

- The Boston Red Sox have
named Jimy Williams their
new manager.

The former third base
coach for the Atlanta Braves,
Philadelphia Phillies’ manager
Jim Fregosi, and former San
Diego Padres’ manager Larry
Bowa were believed to be the
three ﬁnalists for the job, which
became vacant when Kevin
Kennedy was ﬁred after the
season.

ball recruits when they tried to
sign with the school.

The players who were
recruited and denied admission
were 6-foot-11 power forward
Elton Tyler of West Roxbury,
Mass., and point guard
Jonathan DiPina from South
Boston. 1

The players signed letters
of intent to play at Boston
College, but the administration,
not the athletics department, did
not accept them.

Though the recruits met
NCAA standards, ofﬁcials said
the two did not meet the
school’s strict . academic crite-

32 minutes of action.
Dickenson scored 12 points in
the ﬁnal 4:44 of the contest
but he missed a pair of shots in
the final 30 seconds that
would have given Geelong the
win.

“This is a really good
team, they beat Georgia on OT
last night and they have expe-
rience. I’ll tell you about that
one kid [Dickenson] is one

- heck. of a player. I wonder if

he has any eligibility left, I’d
like to get him over here.”
The Panthers grabbed 43
rebounds, but the interior
game will have to improve
before they face Illinois State

in the season opener Sunday‘

night at the Field House.
“No doubt we’re going to
need it. Mark [Blount] isn’t

really playing well right now ,

and he has to come along but
the big thing is that he’s keep-
ing his head up and working
hard. We miss Gerald and

The final score: Notre Dame 60,
Pitt 6. This guy was off by only 12
total points, and he nailed the mar-
gin of victory, despite its unnatural
size.

If you could take that ability to
Vegas, you’d own a small nation by
now. Out there, it makes you a leg-
end.

In South Bend, it makes you a
shopkeeper. Apparently, this
Fightin’ Irish blessing is confined
by geographic limits.

Gee, maybe it is the water. Oh,
that reminds me...

Example three: junior Ryan
Gee, the Notre Dame Leprechaun,
was asked about his rags—to-Lucky
Charms lifestyle.

“I tried out my freshman year,”
said Gee. “I never thought I’d actu-
ally become the Leprechaun.”

Now, we have a crucial part to
the theory -- the exception that
proves the rule.

Example four: Pitt alumnus
Steve Buchman, who lives in
Chicago, was asked for his predic-
tion on the contest hours before it
started.

His best guess — “I think it’s
going to be closer than a lot of peo-
ple think.”

A Nice try, Mr. Buchman.
Apparently, Chicago is a bit too far
northwest for the Irish magic to
work. It probably didn’t help that
Buchman and his cronies were
wearing Panther colors on Saturday
— nobody in light blue and yellow-
ish gold had much going for them.

Finally, example five — our
most famous subject:

NFL commish Paul Tagliabue
was in attendance at Saturday’s
contest. An avid Notre Dame fan,
Tagliabue rarely gets a chance to
exercise his prognostication ability
as the unbiased head of a sports
league. You might think he would-
n’t be good at this type of thing.

However, South Bend brought
him out of his shell. Cornered at the
press gate, the commish came
through with this gem: “Well, I
guess you’d have to think the home
team has a chance of winning.”

Not a sure statement by most
standards, but remember — nonbi-
ased commissioner. Coming from
him, any kind of prediction means
something.

And, of course, he got it right.
Notre Dame did have a chance of
winning. A large chance.

Maybe the line told him some-
thing. Maybe he’s a closet Jimmy

‘ the Greek.

I still say it’s in the water.

’itt News.
