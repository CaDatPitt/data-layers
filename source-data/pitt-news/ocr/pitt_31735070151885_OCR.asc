reident-elect to pitch travel grants for student researchers

Matt Olm said he would have spent about
$800 on a trip to the American Society for
Microbiology meeting in Denver last sum-
mer if his research lab had not covered the
expenses. _

Olm, a senior majoring in microbiology,
attended and presented his research on bacte-
rial DNA at the conference. L

But if senior Mike Nites, the incoming
Student Government Board president, ﬁnds

success with one of his campaign initiatives, A

Pitt students may have access to additional
funds for research-related trips.

Nites said he plans to introduce student
travel grants that the Board would award to
undergraduate students conducting research.

‘PEDUTO

Political Empowerment Project in
Pittsburgh, said he hopes Peduto will
be “veryresponsive to the needs of the
city, in general, and the many needs of
the African American community.”

Stevens said Peduto’s attention to the

Coalition Against Violence, a collabora-
tive that aims to decrease violence and
crime throughout the city, increases
his confidence that the new mayor will
enforce legislation against violence. He
said Peduto has attended several of the
group’s conferences and meetings. ,

Before Peduto’s inaugural address,
several members of the community
spoke on behalf of Pittsburgh’s future
under a new regime.

Vanessa German, a Pittsburgh-based
artist, performed spoken word poetry.
Her passionate speech, which highlight-
ed the human need for endless hope and
love, catapulted audience members,out
of their seats at its conclusion.

“Let us bear forth the power of hope.

These grants would be used to help cover the
costs of travel expenses for students hoping
to attend or present at research conferences.

TheStudentGovernmentBoardcurrently ’

oversees the distribution of the $2.6 million
Student Activities Fund, into which all‘non-
College of General Studies undergraduates
pay $80 per semester. The Board allocates
the money to clubs, organizations and club
sports teams at Pitt. C

The recent cuts infunding toward certain
formula groups —— student organizations that
receive a set percentage of the Student Ac-
tivities Fund —— has freed up more money for
other pursuits, according to Nites. .

For instance, Pitt shut down Telefact,-a stu-
dent organization through which employees
answered callers’ requests for information,
last spring. Telefact received $80,000 per

by simply saying, ‘hello,”’ German spoke.
She encouraged the audience not to
give up on the city of Pittsburgh.
“We will insist that this city isas liv-

, able for me as it is for you,” she said.

The Rev. Randy Bush, pastor of East
Liberty Presbyterian Church, followed
German with remarks’ that suggested
the quality of a leader can be measured
in photographs. He said he hopes the
mayor’s duties, which will comprise ad-
ministrative tasks that involve fixing
potholes and plowing snowy streets,
will not conﬁne him to his office. He

recalled legendary leaders, including

Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa and
Martin. Luther King Jr., who are often,
featured in photographs surrounded by
common people.

“What types of photos will hang on
your walls?” Bush rhetorically asked
Peduto. I

Likewise, Bush said he hopes photo-
graphs will show Peduto “in the streets”
and less often with celebrities or politi-
clans.

“The secret of lasting success is not
how tall you build things, but that you

_ year in allocations while it was active.

The University also cut yearly funding
for the University yearbook, Panther Prints
— which received $40,000 per year in.al—
locations — this fall. Panther Prints will still
receive $10,000 for an online photo album
thatwill replacethe print yearbook. _

Nites said some of the leftover money
could go toward funding this_program. He
said he plans to propose the reservation of
$20,000 — a sum which could later increase
depending on the success of the program ——
in allocations for undergraduate research.

He said the Board wouldnot determine

whether to award travel grants based on the
‘ content of the research, but any undergradu-

ate student presenting research at a confer-
ence could be eligible for a grant.
“When we think of the Student Activities

ensure a ﬂoor exists, below which no
one isable to fall,” ‘Bush said. _
Peduto focused much of his cam-
paign on platforms of accountability,
responsibility and sustainability, which
he reiterated in his address. ‘A
“Whatever we take from this place, be
it wealth or success or happiness  we

have a moral obligation to return with -

interest to generations yet unborn,”
Peduto said. _ A
Rachel Filippini, executive director
of Group Against Smogand Pollution, a
nonproﬁt located in Garﬁeld, said she
hopes Peduto will enforce laws and leg-

, islation to protectlclean air and water.

Filippini worked with Peduto on sev-
eral of the group’s projects, calling him
a “champion of environmental efforts.”

Cecile Springer, who was a co—chair
for Peduto’s campaign,_said the “secret,
to his success” was the network of sup-
porters and his own efforts.

“What I see is a mayor with a vision, a V
plan and a focus on our neighborhoods,”

Springer said.
Peduto surprised Chuck Christen,
executive director for Pittsburgh AIDS

Fund, we usually think of things like mock
trial, club sports, cultural groups or religious
groups. We forget that conducting research
is also an activity that students mightwant to
pursue,” Nites said. A . _
Nites plans to award the grants on a ﬁrst-
come-ﬁrst—served basis until the ﬁmds run
out. i ,
Nites said he has been researching a pro-
gram known as the Undergraduate Confer-

which he plans to use as a model for travel
grants at Pitt. P '

“Bill has been a promoter of neigh-

borhoods as long as I’ve known him,”

Christen said. “He’s promised the voices

Lucille Prater—Holliday, a resident

of Homewood, said she was impressed“ '

the Undergraduate Conference Fund, which
Picon helped create.

“We felt it was important to provide un-
dergraduate students equal opportunity to
use their student activity fees whether they
were playing sports, participating in cultural
events or presenting their research around
the world,” Picon said.

Picon said the Student Government As-

sociation made the ﬁmd available to students '

this fall, and that undergraduates can apply to
receive a $250 stipend to help pay for travel
costs while attending research conferences.

The Undergraduate Conference Fund is
based on a Graduate Conference Fund pro-
gram that has been available for graduate
students at Georgia Tech for at least eight
years, according to Arren Washington, presi-
dent of the Georgia Tech Graduate Student
Government Association. The ﬁmd consists of
$110,000 in allocations reserved for research
conference expenses.

Although Olm said he believes $250 would
not cover an entire trip’s expenses, he sup-

ports Nites’ idea to reserve funds for indi-
vidual undergraduate students attending or
presenting in research conferences.

“I think that attending a research confer-
ence is a great experience for undergraduate
researchers to have, and I would support any
effort to help make that possible,” Olm said.

Nites said he plans to introduce his pro-
posal for travel grants with the Board privately
during their retreat onjanuary 11. After the
retreat, he said he hopes to discuss the grants
at public Board meetings. 

Nites added that a majority of the Student
Government Board members must agree on
a proposal for the travel grants before the
Board can present the ﬁnal plan to Pitt ad-
ministrators for approval. If Dean of Students
Kathy Humphrey approves the proposal, N i-
tes hopes students will be able to apply for
grants next fall.

Pitt’s Graduate and Professional Student
Government has already implemented a simi-
lar program.

David Gau, GPSG president, said he thinks
the grants are “an interesting idea.” '

The GPSG executive board collects
$180,000 from the activities fees graduate

students pay each semester, according to Gau.

Each school year, the board allocates 25 per-
cent of the ﬁmd to travel grants for students
to attend conferences.

Graduate students who apply for the
grants receive $200 if they present research
at a conference or $100 if they attend a con-
ference, Gau said.

Gau said the GPSG allocates more money
to students presenting at research confer-
ences because of submission and registration
fees. Gau also said the extra $100 incentivizes
graduate students to submit their work to
research conferences.

Alex Majchrzak, the former SGB Alloca-
tions Committee chairman, said he supports
Nites’ travel grants.

“There should be a portion of money
set aside for this project and [that portion
of money] should be clearly separate from
the allocation of ﬁinds for student groups,”
Majchrzak said.

According to Nites, extra allocation funds
roll over into an overhead ﬁmd for the next
year.

Majchrzak and Nites both said they were
unsure of the approximate amount of unspent
allocations from 2012 through 2013.

biology, saidshe attended a meeting of the
Allegheny Branch ofthe American Society for
Microbiology last spring in State College, Pa.

She said that whi1e,$250 might not cover
the costs of national conferences, the amount
could be enough to cover “equally important
local meetings.”

“Pitt does a great job at offering research
experiences,” Shine said. “But it often doesn’t
follow through in providing these types of op-
portunities which truly make our graduates
stand out for grad school, medical school or
the work industry.” I

Ken Service, Pitt’s vice chancellorfor com-
munications, said that the University provides
extensive opportunities" for undergraduate
students to be involved in research.

He said he does not know of any program
similar to Nites’ proposed student travel
grants.

' “While there is no University—wide pro-
gram to support student travel to confer-
ences to present research papers, most of
the schools have some resources available
for this purpose,” Service said.

Service recommended that students speak
with their respective research instructors
and dean’s offices or the University Honors
Collegein order to seek out opportunities for
research grants. ' . 0

Nites agreed that Pitt, as well as individual
University departments, provides many op-
portunities for students conducting research,
but said that the Student Government Board
is striving to encourage more participation in
research among undergraduate students by
providing some ﬁnancial aid.

“Student Government Board’s goal is to
explore creating and ﬁinding for an under-
graduate, University—wide program to en:
courage academic excellence and intellectual
curiosity, while supplementing opportunities
provided by the departments,” Nites said. I

EDITORIAL,  

 

Tread carefully: Peduto’s progressive

rhetoric optimistic, empty

Matt Barnes
Columnist

District 8 Councilman Bill Peduto
is Pittsburgh’s mayor, and as pro-
foundly stated on the night of his

victory, we have ended “the era of '

Renaissance.”

” ' Instead, Peduto aims to change
Pittsburgh through community co-
operation, rather than “big thing”
investments, in order to promote
economic growth and long—term
sustainability.

A key element of Peduto’s new 4

Pittsburgh is based upon the idea of
a“21st-century Pittsburgh Survey.”
In 1907, a team of social scientists
developed the Pittsburgh Survey,
a comprehensive study designed
to identify the challenges of urban
life and reform city government in
a progressive direction. According
to the policy paper “A 21st Cen-
tury Pittsburgh Survey,” posted to
billpeduto.com, the mayorbelieves
that the 106-year—old study needs
an update.

Peduto wants to directly investi-
gate the ills that plague the modern
urban environment: “We need to
talk to workers, to entrepreneurs,
to people who ride public transpor-

tation, to community leaders and .
to the corporate and foundation ‘

communities —— people of all stripes
throughout Pittsburgh — to ﬁnd
out where we are now and where we

could go and to put it into metrics _

that we can use to make positive
change.” -

Our 67th mayor aims to change.
A proud progressive, Pedutoseeks
to govern Pittsburgh as the director
of an “urban lab.” He plans to imple-
ment universal pre—kindergarten

education in the city. He intends _

to limit city congestion by rework-

ing bus lanes. Additionally, Peduto
holds clean energy and green alter-
natives as integral com ponents to
his agenda. Although his plans are
optimistic and his rhetoric is awﬁilly
convincing, the progressive agenda
he boasts must be ﬁlled with initia-
tives that truly enhance Pittsburgh.
Empty promises are unacceptable.

Peduto’s plans for a new Pitts— -

burgh are ambitious and will hope-
fully prove successful. However, ac-
complishinghis goals and executing
his agenda will prove a difficult and
complicated process. I

Even so, Peduto and his asso-
ciates do not seem worried. In an
interview with People for Peduto
Communications Director Sonya
Toler, she gave insight into how
the new mayor intends to bring his

. plans to fruition.

‘ “It starts with hiring people
of integrity and keeping them in
place,” Toler said. “Greater trans-
parency and accountability to the

public are. main focuses.”

It appears that the new mayor is
sendingamessage that city govem-
ment should be aplace comprised of
high—caliber individuals whose par-
amount concernis those governed.
Inaddition, Peduto wants to update
city government technologically.

“Pittsburgh is behind,” Toler
said,‘ in comparing city govem-
ments across the nation. ‘

“Better technology leads to
"more efficiency, which leads to

ﬁnancial savings, which leads to
more accessibility to the people,”
Toler said.

Toler proposes a simple logic
— perhaps too simple. In real-
ity, nothing is that easy, especially
with government. How exactly is
Pittsburgh going to progress tech-
nologically? Who will provide the

money for such upgrades? Why is
it necessary to upgrade? Chang-
ing just because other éities are
changing does not always lead to
proper action. Pittsburgh has done
extremely well compared to other
post-industrial cities. Why change
for the sake of change if things are
not going badly? Should new city
government technology really be
a top priority for Pittsburgh, resi-
dents? Oftentimes, the cure is worse

-than the disease, even in regard to -

small matters such as unnecessary
technological upgrades.

When it comes to environmen-
tal policy, Toler clearly stated that
“The environment comes ﬁrst in
everything we do.”

At a December White House
meeting for city mayors, Peduto
directly discussed the environ-
ment and progressive energy poli-
cies with President Barack Obarna.
Peduto asked the White House for
assistance regarding an energy-sav-
ing program that would make Pitts—
burgh the nation’s ﬁrst city to move
entirely to LED street lights. He also
asked for requirements forcing lo-
cal municipalities to decrease their
sewage overﬂows, which would
allow for more environmentally
friendly improvement plans. a

. Going green.is great. But once
again, how is this going to happen?
Obama is not Santa Claus. Asking

the President for something makes » I

for a good story but shouldnot be
considered as a reliable road map
for implementation.

Peduto also spoke with the
president about.his universal pre-
kindergarten plan. I b

“He talked directly to the presi-
dent about it, who in turn was very

interested in seeing it happen,” Toler said.

According to Toler, Peduto feels that “the
public must be involved in every decision.”

, The generalities keep piling up. The 21st
century is notthe time for general rhetoric but
rather for clear and speciﬁc policy.

Peduto and his team are equipped with
zealand sincerity. “Bill was ﬁxed on.a_ goal
— to become mayor of Pittsburgh so that
he could be the chief advocate for the city,”
Toler claimed. ‘

Unfortunately, pure enthusiasm can only
go so far. It takes rational policy experts and
efﬁcient managers to execute good gover-
nance. Idealistic proposals alone cannot get
the job done. 2

. This should be painﬁllly evident to every
American citizen. In 2008, then-Senator
Obama campaigned on a promise of change.
Nearly ﬁve years have passed since hisjanuary
2009 inauguration and there is little to show
in the form of actual accomplishments. In
2008, The Illinois senator promised to close
Guantanamo Bay Prison, implement no new

taxes forfamilies making under $250,000 per
year, and introduce a comprehensive immi-
gration reform bill by the end ofhis ﬁrst year
in office — none of which actually happened-.
In fact, the only major domestic accomplish-
ment of the president’s administration, the
Affordable Care Act, is the quintessential
example of the inefficiency and ineffective-
ness that is a result of change through big
government. _

The reality is that our system is not one
suited to the whims and generalities of cam-
paign rhetoric. Because of this, citizens are
often disappointed, particularly when the few
programs that ‘actually come into existence
are not as remarkable as theywere made out
to be. Carefully conceived plans must be put
in place for anything to move forward.

Peduto andhis staff can discuss the im-
portance of the environment and universal
pre—l<indergarten education. But once again,
How is this all going to happen? From where
is the money coming‘? What makes Peduto
different from every other progressivewhose
ideas look great on paper but fail in real life?

“The mayor is keenly aware of ﬁnancial
realities,” Toler said. ,

"Toler insists that progress cannot be made

by city government alone.

“Nonproﬁts, foundations and any respon-
sible and good citizenwill all be a part ofbuild—
ing a new Pittsburgh,” she said.

Civic engagement is essential in reaching
a representative democracy’s potential. How-
ever, Peduto and his staff continue to speak in
generalities _that offer no true solution. What

‘ exactly are the ﬁnancial realities of which the

mayor is keenly aware‘? Which nonproﬁts,
which foundations, which citizens are going
to help build a new Pittsburgh? Relying on
entities andpeople that are not fully lined up
is afailure waitingto happen. Remember, mil-
lions of young people were supposed to_sign
up for new health plans and bring Obarnacare
to fruition. Howﬁclid that turn out‘?

_ For policy to be effective, it must be clearly, I

thoroughly and succinctly devised and im-
plemented. The problem with progressive
agendas such as Peduto’s is that it sounds
great, but it offers little substance in terms
of real-world application. The fallacy of big
government intervention is the belief that
the state can effectively bring about sweeping
change in an efﬁcient manner. In reality, the
world is a complicated place. Change for the
sake of change usually only contributes to

greater complication and more burden for
the citizen, whether through excess taxes,
over-regulation or uimecessary mandates.

With arational outlook, ﬁscal responsibil-
ity and an eye focused on detail and efficacy,
government involvement can help to move
Pittsburgh forward. Peduto appears to be
aware that his agenda is not feasible if only ex-
ecuted by him and his city hall colleagues. An
agenda focused on the public can only prove
successful with the public’s participation. It
is, then, the responsibility of every Pittsburgh
voter, corporation, foundation, nonproﬁt,
university andlhealth care conglomerate to be
open—minded toward the new rnayor’s wishes
and to not only wish for his success, but to
contribute toward it.

Reducing poverty, preserving the environ-
ment and ensuring educational opportunities
are the responsibilities of all citizens, regard-
less of their political dispositions. Today be-
gins a new era for the city of Pittsburgh built
upon the foundation of civic participation.
The new mayor appears welcoming to diverse
solutions, and it is our responsibility to help
provide them in order to realize a new and
greater Pittsburgh. I

Paleo dieting: Even a caveman can do it, but should We?

Jackson Crowder
Stuff FVrz'ter

Everyone wants to be healthy, but follow-
ing through is often challenging — par-
ticularly over winter break, when many
students ﬁnd themselves catching up on
their favorite shows and scarﬁng down
homemade cookies. Conveniently, New
Year’s is a time for new beginnings (at
least, in theory). It’s a time when people
resolve to hit the gym and go on a diet.
While the general consensus is that
regular exercise and a good diet are
the keys to a long life, the deﬁnition of
healthy eating is far from clear. One needs
only to step into a GNC, a health food
store or even watch late night infomer-
cials to see another miracle diet guaran-
teeing everything short of immortality.

Whether or not such diets work seems
irrelevant. According to NBC, Americans
spend close to 50 billion dollars annually
on diet products, most of them going
unused.

The Paleolithic, or Paleo, Diet how-
ever, has bucked the trend. The diet has
not only gained real popularity, but has
stood the test of time — both because of
and in spite of its use of dietary science.

The Paleo Diet, which bases its ap-
proach to dieting on evolutionary his-
tory, has existed since the 19705. Famed
gastroenterologist Walter Voegtlin intro-.
duced the concept in his book “The Stone
Age Diet,” published in 1975.

Loren Cordain later introduced the
Paleo Diet as it is known today, taking
issue with the fat and sugar-heavy diets
of contemporary Americans and calling

for a return to the diets of our hunter- »

gatherer ancestors.

The idea of the Paleo Diet is simple: If
our caveman forbearers could have found
it, picked it, or bludgeoned it to death,
the Paleo Diet approves.

The diet promotes foods that Paleo-
lithic humans could have easily acquired,
speciﬁcally hormone—free meat, ﬁsh,
seeds, fruits, certain vegetables, mush-

‘ rooms and even insects. The diet shuns

Neolithic innovations such as cultivated
grains like barley and wheat, legumes,
dairy and more modern fare such as re-

. ﬁned sugars.

Unlike other diets, Paleo is not singu-
larly focused on weight loss or building
muscle mass. Rather, its goal is an overall
improvement of one’s health, particularly
a reduction in the risk of chronic diseases

that advocates claim have arisen since the
start of the Neolithic, or agricultural, era.

Since the publication of Cordain’s
2002 book, simply titled, “The Paleo
Diet,” the nutrition plan has gained popu-
larity, ﬁrst in exercise communities, due
largely to its emphasis on protein. The
diet made its way to mainstream society
soon after.

Brandon Lee, a senior engineering ma-
jor who has been on a low-carbohydrate
version of the Paleo Diet since his second
year on campus, sticks rigidly to the plan
— except on days when he lifts weights.

On lifting days, more carbohydrates are-

needed to replenish one’s glycogen levels.
“I still don’t eat grains or pasta on
these days, but I do have ice cream, choco-

or protein.

Since beginning his diet, Lee said that
his average weight is about nine pounds
less than it was beforehand. Prior to
starting Paleo, Lee said he was eating
an abundance of reﬁned carbs (grains,
pastas, cereals and the like).

“That actually made it difficult to eat
vegetables,” he said, referencing the dif-
ﬁculty of balancing one’s diet while’ eating
the wrong things. ‘

Beyond weight loss, Lee claims that
the diet is making him feel better in his
everyday life, even going so far as to at-
tribute healing qualities to it.

“The pain I received in freshman year
of high school as a-result of joint injury
from swimming is gone. I used to [have
an asthma attack] like once a year, but
it pretty much stopped shortly after I

started my [new] way of eating,” he said. .

ies” deals with the female anatomy. On
thealbum highlight, “Marry the P*ssy,”
Kelly romanticizes and personiﬁes his

A 2006 study undertaken by the de-
partment of clinical sciences at Lund
University in Sweden concluded that
the Paleo or a Paleo-like diet can reduce
C—reactive protein levels in the body ——_
which eases joint inﬂammation.

Suggestions have been made by some
in the medical community that there is a
link between asthma and the consump-
tion of processed foods, but thus far,
no evidence has arisen to support their
claims. It is, however, widely accepted
that vitamin C and E deﬁciencies can lead
to poor lung function.

Unlike most people on Paleo, Lee eats
only one big meal a day but rigidly follows
his diet, which can predictably lead to
some challenges when trying to eat on
campus.

tral and eating lunch meat and cheeses.

Some tracks, such as “You Deserve Bet-

and autotune, evoking the emotional

Disappointing ‘Anchorman 2’

‘ ’ I substitutes cameos for content

Jack Trainor
. ‘Staff Wrz'ter

“Anchorman 2”

Directed by Adam McKay

Starring: Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul
Rudd

Grade: D

Will Ferrell takes his scick too far in his reprisal 0 Ron Burgundy. MCT Campus

If you were as big afan of 2004’s “Anchorman”
as I was, then you understand why “Anchor—
man 2” was one of the most highly anticipated
ﬁlms of the last decade, and thus one of the
most disappointing. The sequel to one of the
landmark ﬁlms in Will Ferrell’s career puts
so much effort into making a spectacle that
one has to wonder if Ferrell forgot what made
“Anchorman” ﬁmny in the ﬁrst place.

Set in 1980, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell)
and wife Veronica Comingstone (Christina
Applegate) pick up where Anchorman ended,
co-anchoring primetime news in New York
City. The story accelerates quickly when Ve-
ronica is promoted to the new nightly anchor
position while Ron is ﬁred. He returns to San
Diego, where a new 24-hour Global News Net-
work (GNN) hires him and his old news crew
buddies.

From there, the plot promptly turns into a
series of tangential “Saturday Night Live” skits
loosely connected by Ron’s quest to regain
his mantle as America’s No. 1 anchor (again).

Where to begin? Everything we loved about
the original — boisterous and loony charac-
ters, violently ﬁmny slapstick — is forcefully
over— exploited in “Anchorman 2.”

For instance‘, incompetent weatherman

Brick Tarnland (Steve Carell) was arguably the
funniest character in “Anchorman.” He didn’t
have many speaking lines,» but when he did
talk, itwas usually hilarious and quote-worthy
(“Loud noises!”).,- . '

In this sequel, Brick has twice as many
speaking lines, and not a single one is memo-
rable. When he’s not saying something com-
pletely irrelevant (which he does a lot more
this time), he’s screaming at the top of his
lungs in that nasally shriek of his.- This isn’t
what made Brick’s lines ﬁmny in the ﬁrst ﬁlm,
and it certainly doesn’t conjure a laugh in the
sequel.

Sports anchor Champ Kind (David Koech-
ner), is even more overblown than Brick. His
secret love for Ron Burgundy, whichwas ﬁmny
because it was only hinted at in Anchorman,
becomes woefully exaggerated. ,

The ﬁlm doesn’t lack material with which
to work, either — it has the entire decade of
1980 and CNN (represented by Ron’s new
employer, GNN) with which to play.

Instead of doing what “Anchorman” did
best — poking ﬁm at news culture —- the
movie shamelessly leans on aplethora of non-
sensical celebrity cameos (Kanye West, Drake
and Liam Neeson, to name a few) more than
actual jokes and media commentary.

Harrison Ford’s cameo as an intimidat-
ingly stoic news anchor is actually a pleasant
and amusing surprise — until he tums into a
werewolf and disappears (literally).

It’s disheartening to see the likes of Ferrell,
Carell and Paul Rudd waste their talents on a
movie that obviously spent mo re thought and
effort on celebrity cameos and advertising
than it did on writing. I

Panthers cruise to first
, conference victory

Nate Barnes
Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

Pitt’s ﬁrst home ACC game started fairly
better than its ﬁrst ACC game on the road,
when the Panthers faced an early 15-point
deﬁcit in Raleigh, N .C., against North Caro-
lina State Saturday.

Back at the Petersen Events Center Mon-
day,the Maryland Terrapins hung tight with
the Panthers through the game’s ﬁrst 18
minutes. But a quick spurt by the Panthers
at the end of the ﬁrst half and through the
start of the second keyed a 20-point, 79-59
victory for Pitt (14—1, 2-0 ACC).

Behind that run?

“This man. Durand Johnson,” redshirt
senior forward Lamar Patterson said post-

V game, gesturing to the man sitting to his

right.

J Johnson, a redshirt sophomore guard,
ﬁnished with a career-high 17 points —
including a stretch at the beginning of the
second half in which he scored seven of
Pitt’s ﬁrst 11 points —— on 6—of-8 shooting

and a 3-for-4 performance from long range.

Head coachjamie Dixon startedJohnson
in the second half after Maryland forward
Evan Smotrycz challenged freshman for-
wards Michael Young andJamel'Artis with
his three 3-pointers. Dixon wanted Patter-
son on Smotrycz, whilejohnson provided
scoring punch off the bench.

“Playing smaller, I think, was key late in
the ﬁrst half, then in the second half getting
us the lead,” Dixon said.

"From there, the Panthers didn’t look
back. V
" “We all came together before the half
started and said “C’mon y’all, this is our half.
Let’s sustain this lead and let’s turn it up a
notch,”’ Johnson said. “We ended up win-
ning by 20 points, so that was good to see.”

Johnson’s effort led a 31-point scoring
night from Dixon’s reserves, whom he said,
“[were] really the thing that got us going
in the ﬁrst and then continued through-
out the second half.” Newkirk added eight

better — whatever I gotta do to be the guy
that just brings the team up.”
In that case,Johnson gave the Panthers
the answer they needed, too. V
With Pitt trailing 26-23 with 6:14 re-
maining in the ﬁrst half,Johnson uncoiled
a jumper from the big hands on his long

arms, which were’ covered just below the .

shoulder by a tight white undershirt worn
under the Panthers’ all—gold uniforms that
made the 6-6 forward stand out as soon as
he walked on the court.

Johnson sank the shot, fading away
from the basket in the process and cut-
ting Maryland’s lead to 26-25. Nearly four
minutes later, Pitt had grabbed a lead.

Johnson pushed the Panthers ahead

even further with 2:21 left in the ﬁrst half.
He received a pass at the right elbow and
heldthe ball, peering back toward Dixon,
who held aclenchedﬁst in the air. Turning
around and quickly breaking to his right
with a crossover, Johnson found himself
at the top of the key with the ball cocked
high above his head for a 3-pointer.

Pitt led, 34—28, but Johnson had one
more trick for the half tucked behind his
white spandex sleeves.

With less than a minute to play, Johnson
stood with the ball near the left corner of
the court before charging toward the hoop,
penetrating the paint. As he went up for a
layup, he was met at the rim by one of the
Terrapins’ thick-bodied big men.

‘Roc’ a tradition of school pride upheld by those in the suit

Antonio Reed
For The Pitt News

As the shot goes up and the fans anticipate
the result of the game, another, more rec-
ognizable fan is also waiting for the shot to
go in or bounce off the rim. As the ball exits
the bottom of the net, Roc, Pitt’s mascot,
leaps from the sideline, throws his paws
in the air and becomes the ringleader for
the ensuing mayhem. _

The person currently behind the suit
is current seniorjohn Kornaga, who has
worn the suit since his sophomore year.
Kornaga hails from the Greater Philadel-
phia area majoring in ﬁnance in the College
of Business Administration.

Because Kornaga was always a bit of
a class clown in high school, his trans-
formation isn’t at all surprising for him.
But becoming the mascot for a Division
I university was the result of something
very common to men: a dare.

“I told my roommate about [the open-
ing for the mascot position] and he said
to me, ‘You won’t go try out. I dare you
to do it. You won’t,’” Kornaga said. “And
from there I went, showed off some dance
moves, did a routine to some music and
eventually got the position as Roc.’f

Although I(ornaga’s tenure as Roc has
been relatively short, the development of
Roc — and the Panther —- has spanned
multiple centuries.

Until 1909, Pitt was known as Western
University of Pennsylvania and was located
on the North Side.

The school’s team name was the Wups,
derived from the University’s nickname
“Wup.” Once the location of the school
moved from the North Side to Oakland, the
name University of Pittsburgh was adopted

and the Panthers were born.

George M.P. Baird, who wrote the Uni-
versity’s alma mater. and suggested the
name the “Panthers,” says it was chosen
for a multitude of reasons.

According to the University’s web site,
Baird said the most important reasons are
that panthers once populated the Pitts-
burgh area, the alliteration with the word
Pittsburgh and that no other college had
that mascot at the time. The University
was evolving into a very different, new
and exciting entity.

It wasn’t until the 1990s that Pitt’s mas-
cot became what he’s known as today: Roc.

The name serves to commemorate for-
mer Pitt football player, assistant coach,
assistant to the athletic director and life-
long fan, Steve “the Rock” Petro.

“Steve was a man who loved his school
with unwavering loyalty, regardless of the
fortunes,” former football head coachjohn
Majors said. “Never in my life have Imet
a man that I thought was more loyal and

’ more dedicated and had a deeper love for

one school than Steve Petro had for the
Panthers and the University of Pittsburgh.”

And now as the physical embodiment
of that dedication, Kornaga as Roc must
continue the tradition of Pitt pride set
before him.

After earning the mascot position,
Kornaga had to shadow the previous
mascot for a three-month period. During
that time, learning to mimic the move-
ments and mannerisms became Vital to
the process.

With that in mind, learning to make the
position unique is equally as important.
But there are certain things that won’t
change from mascot to mascot.

For instance, at Pitt football games, the

    

 
   

azaé-

Roc frequently enters the Panther Pitt to spark entiiusiasm.lBobby M_izia [Visual Editor

mascot must do push—ups after each touch-
down for every point the team has scored
by that point. After one touchdown, Roc
does seven push—ups, after two, he does

14 and continues this pattern for as many .

touchdowns as Pitt scores in one game.
It might be hard to notice Roc during a
football game because of the size of the sta-
dium, but this isn’t true for the basketball
games held at the Petersen Events Center.
“I love football games, but the basket-
ball games are awesome,” Kornaga said.

“You’re just as much a part of the game as
the players. You can swing the entire mood
of the crowd with your own enthusiasm.
Leading the Zoo in chants will always be
a fond memory of mine.” ‘
Fortunately for Roc, the student body
reciprocates his feelings of gratitude.
“It’s always fun to see the team win,
but with Pitt you never know,” lifelong
Pitt fan and junior Cooper Cullen said.

points in 18 minutes off the bench.

_ “Both of them are spark plugs coming off
the bench,” Patterson said. “It’s just good
to see these guys step it up a notch in big
games like this, in ACC, and we expect that
from them all year long.”

Among the starters, Patterson led all
scorers-with 19 points on 8—of—12 shoot—
ing and Talib Zanna nearly posted his ﬁfth
double—double of the season with 13 points
and a game—high nine rebounds.

Patterson’s steady play led a Pitt team
that continually wore the Terrapins (10—6,
2-1 ACC) down, especially on both ends of
the ﬂoor. .

“I thought we tried to guard in the ﬁrst
half,” Maryland head coach Mark Turgeon

- said. “I don’t think defensively we were di-

aled in the second half. I think we let the
score and missed jump shots affect our
defense in the second half.” J

In that second half, due to Pitt’s con-
tinual defensive pressure and physicality,

the Terrapins seemingly gave up on attack-
ing the basket.

“I do think that we settled for too many
jump shots,” Turgeon said. “I won’t mention
any names.”

After Smotrycz made three of four
3—pointers in the ﬁrst half, he made only one
of seven in the game’s second 20 minutes.
Overall, Smotrycz scored 14 points but shot
an inefficient 4—of-13 from the ﬁeld.

Seth Allen led the Terrapins with 18
points off the bench and ﬁnished 5-of-11
from the ﬁeld. Jake Layman, who entered
the contest scoring 13.7 points per game,
was held to just three points and one made
ﬁeld goal.

Layman, another versatile forward, was
held in check via the adjustments made from
the Panthers bench.

“We were able to play a lot of different
options today,” Dixon said. “I was really
concerned about Smotrycz as a four, hav-
ing two freshman guarding a guy that can
shoot it like that.”
