VOLUME EIGHTY-TWO, ISSUE.SlXTY-SEVENQQ,

Pitt nightclub set to
open next weekend

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board announced plans to open
the long—awaited university-
sponsored campus nightclub and
discussed plans for the coming
term at their first meeting last
night.

Opening night for the non-
alcoholic nightclub is set for Jan.
22. Admission is free for all Pitt
students.

The Pittsburgh band, The Af-
fordable Floors, is scheduled to
perform at the nightc|ub’s Jan. 22
opening, according to Melanie
Naro, chairman of the nightclub
committee.

Last year’s Board allocated
$16,000 for the nightclub project
to be used for decorations and to
pay the bands. The allocation
enables Pitt students to use the
nightclub free of charge. Naro
said the committee is considering
a charge for non-Pitt students
who are brought as guests of
students.

Since the nightclub is still’
- without a name, the Pitt Program
Council is to sponsor a contest at A

the nightcIub’s opening. The stu-
dent who' devises the winning
name will be awarded a prize, ac-
cording to Naro.

The nightclub will be held ev-
ery Friday night of the term in the
Concourse area of the William
Pitt Union. I

In other business, SGB Presi-

dent Craig Jackson announced
that students will now be able to
use the Bellefield Annex’s recre-
ation facilities. ' The facilities,
previously open only to Pitt's
faculty and staff, include a swim-
ming pool, gymnasium, six
raquetball-handbalI-squash
courts and locker-room facilities.

The fee for use of the pool is
$30 per term and $25 for use of
the courts.

 

Please see story on page 3

Ron Miletta, chairman of the

Judicial Committee, presented-

the Board with a proposal for
changes in the SGB constitution.

The changes mostly entail revi-
sions in the wording which clari-
fy that the Student Government
Board does not represent or in-
clude the College of General
Studies.

Other -revisions include:

0 Appointment and removal of
committee chairpersons shall be

determined by a quorum of the -

Board. v

0 Elections for the SGB will be

held during the third week in
November, rather than the sec-
ond, in order to avoid conflict
with national, state and local
elections.

0 Responsibility for the recog-
nition status of student organiza-
tions is removed from the
Allocations Committee and grant-
ed to the Office of Student Ac-
tivities.

IFC and Panhel induct officers

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

The new Interfraternity Coun-
cil and Panhellenic Association
officers, elected last November,
began their term of office at 6:30
Tuesday afternoon.

Chuck Farinella, from Pi Kap-
pa Alpha, is the IFC president,
and Michele Jedlica (Kappa Del-
ta) became the Panhellenic Coun-
cil president.

”It’s hard to follow in their foot-
steps,” said Jedlica, referring to
last year's officers, "because they
had an excellent executive board
last year. ldon’t think I'd like to
do much differently.”

This year's officers, however,
do have certain goals in mind for
the Greeks in 1988 and beyond.

”We want to promote unity
among the Greeks," said Farinel-
la. ”There has always been com-
petition among the houses, and
we don't want to stop the com-
petition because it is healthy, but
we want the fraternities to work
together more often.”
Farinella also wants to work
more closely with each house.
”We find that if a house has a
problem, they aren't likely to
bring it up during the meetings of
the heads of the houses,” said
Farinella. ”So we are going to
visit each house. In that environ-
ment, the fraternities tend to be
more open about any problems.”
Another goal is to polish up the
Greeks reputation among the‘ rest
of the university. ,
”When people think of Greek,
we don't want them to think of

something negative,” said JedIi-
ca. ”We want them to think of
something positive, something
that benefits the University of
Pittsburgh.”

With Greek Week and winter

Crush occupying the next few

months, the IFC and Panhellenic
Association will have their hands
full. Greek Week includes raising
around $75,000 for charity and
donating blood. As for rush, the
new officers are planning to make
it bigger and better.

”We are looking for ways to
improve dry rush," said Farinel-
la, ”We want the Greek system
to have more- influence in Pitt.
Being a Greek was an experience
that I will never forget, and I want

other people to have that kind of

experience.”

Democratic presidential
candidate Bruce Babbitt will
be making a stop at the
University of Pittsburgh Sun-
day during a one-day swing
through the state of Penn-
sylvania.

The former governor of Ari-
zona will discuss his demands
for ”workpIace democracy,” a
plan which would allow em-
ployees more influence in the
workplace. ’’It is a plan to in-
crease productivity," accord-
ing to Pat Gormley, the
Western Pennsylvania contact
for the Babbitt campaign.

”Babbitt is known for hav-
ing a real specific plan for in-
creasing taxes and cutting

spending,” according to
Gormley.

He will also talk about the
universal needs test. ”It is an
idea by which every program
has to be targeted by a specif-

Babbitt to

4 public and is sponsored by

ic need. Farm subsidies should
be targeted to family farms,
not corporate business,” said
Gormley.

Babbitt has been criticized
by Newsweek for being una-
ble to stir up voter interest in
Iowa, despite major advertis-
ing campaigns a year in ad-
vance of his opponents. Iowa
is considered to be the key
state in the election.

Babbitt is not considered to
be a leading democratic can-
didate in the 1988 election,
trailing behind such candi-
dates as Hart, Jackson and
Simon.

Babbitt will speak in David
Lawrence Hall, room 120, at
I p.m. The event is free to the

The Democratic Forum of
Western Pennsylvania, a non-
partisan group that commis-
sions various political candi-
dates to speak.

After his Pittsburgh talk, he
will head for Philadelphia.

Judge sentences man to 5 years of celibacy

PHILADELPHIA — A federal
judge sentenced a convicted drug
dealer who had fathered three
children out of wedlock to five
years of no sex and threatened
jail for breaking the celibacy re-
quirement.

The unusual condition of a five-

’ year probation sentence, which
0 only marriage can void, was im-

posed on Michael Youngblood,
31, of Philadelphia by senior -U.S.
District Judge John Hannum.
Hannum ordered abstention from
”fornication” and ”bastardy.”
Youngblood offered no

A reaction.

Hannum, describing what he
called the defendant's unaccept-
able ’’social history,” agreed to
be easy on Youngblood only if he
curtailed his sex life.‘

”Subject claims that he main-
tains contact with and provides
some limited financial support to
his three children [but] at this
time subject still remains unmar-
ried,” the judge said as he spelled

out his terms for freedom.
‘ ”You will, as a term of this pro-
bation, obey all local, state and
federal laws, and that pertains to
fornication and bastardy.”

Hannum warned Youngblood
he would go to prison if he vio-
lated the terms during the next
1,825 days.

How the sentence would be
enforced was not spelled out by
the judge. I

Jail officials ignoring

overcrowding orders

PITTSBURGH — Allegheny
County Jail officials routinely vio-
late a federal court order against
inmate crowding, a court inves-

. tigator said.

A daily census to determine
whether the order is being
obeyed is taken at 4 p.m. before
the excess prisoners have
returned from jobs outside ‘the

prison, said the investigator,
former U.S. Attorney Robert
Cindrich.

”There have been some sug-
gestions made to us by prisoners
that during the 4 p.m. count, a
certain number of prisoners are
placed in the. gymnasium at the
new jail in order to artificially
reduce the count,” Cindrich re-
cently told U.S. District Judge
Maurice Cohill.

Based on a 4 a.m. headcount
requested from Warden Charles
Kozakiewicz’s staff, Cindrich cal-
culated the jail’s average popula-
tion to be 560 inmates.

Following a civil rights lawsuit
brought by inmates, Cohill for-
bade the county from keeping
more than 540 inmates in the old
section of the jail and in an an-
nex opened last year.

Gov. Casey may soon

get anti-abortion law

HARRISBURG — The Casey
administration and anti-abortion
advocates met privately Wed nes-
day to seeka compromise on
legislation to restrict abortions in
Pennsylvania.

”|t’s very important that it's car-
fully worked out, and this is hap-
pening right now,” said Mary

Beliveau, an official with the
Pennsylvania Pro—Life Federation.
”We feel progress has been made
 Details of the legislation are
being worked on.”

Lawmakers and other pro—|ife
advocates declined to publicly
discuss specifics of the meeting
they had with members of Gov.
Robert P. Casey's staff. Casey met
with them Monday.

”When you are in the middle
of something like this, the worst
thing you could do is get into
specifics publicly because you
have a tendency then of pushing
people into a corner,” said Rep.
Stephen Freind, a Delaware
County Republican and leading
abortion foe in the Legislature.

But Freind said you can ”bet
the ranch” there will be a new
anti-abortion law in the very near
future.

Casey last month vetoed legis-
lation that would have restricted
access to abortions, but said he
was willing to work with lawmak-
ers to resolve his constitutional
concerns about the legislation. ,

Casey is an opponent of abor-
tions, but vetoed the proposed
legislation because he considered
it unconstitutional. A proposed
anti-abortion law he considers
constitutional will thus probably

get his signature.

States with 55 mph

limit getting ripped

ALBANY, N.Y. — The 12 states
that opted to keep the 55 mph
maximum speed limit are being
unfairly penalized because of
flawed federal regulations, said
New York's chief highway
official.

The 12 states, most of them in
the East, are still bound by rules
requiring speeds to be monitored
at sites chosen by federal officials.
If more than half the motorists are
found to be speeding, highway
aid to the offending state may be
withheld. I

The states that chose to raise
speed limits to 65 mph on rural
highways, as permitted last year,
are free from such monitoring.
This creates a situation where one
state _could be penalized if a
majority of its motorists exceed
55mph while another would be
OK even if its drivers hit 70 mph.

The Student Government
Board has informally agreed to
support the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance's effort to include sex-
ual orientation in the univer-
sity's Equal Opportunity
Statement, according to SGB
President Craig Jackson.

The SGB informallyagreed
prior to last night's meeting to
discern whether such an addi-
tion is needed and, if so, to
draw up an SGB resolution
urging the university to in-
clude sexual orientation in the
Equal Opportunity Statement.

”We first want to find out
why sexual orientation isn't al-
ready in the statement,” said

Board responds to ACT

Jackson. ’’If it is needed, we
will make a resolution.”

The SGB does not have the
authority to make changes in
university policy but can call
upon the university to address
changes by means of resolu-
tions. All changes in universi-
ty policy must ultimately be
aproved by the board of
trustees.

Joel Rapoport, co-
chairperson of ACTION, the
Action Committee to Include
Sexual Orientation to the Non-
discrimination Policy of the
University, said, ”We believe
that in accordance with the be-
liefs of the students and the ac-
tions of the SGB, this is an
extremely positive action by
the SGB. It is, however, only

J a first step, and we have a long
way to go.”

Jackson said he hopes to
take formal action on the issue
as early as next week.

”We want to get.the other
two members [Nan Beal and
Jon Scanlon, who were absent
from last night's meeting] be-
fore we take any action.

”[GALA] is a student organi-
zation we [the SGB] need to
represent, and ifthey’re being
discriminated against, it's our
job to put a stop to it.”

GALA is currently gathering
statments which will support
its claim that students and
faculty are being discriminat-
ed against on the basis of sex-
ual orientation.

Birds get bubblebath

By Bob Dvorchak

Associated Press Writer

FALLSTON, Pa. — Victims of
the Ashland Oil Inc. spill are be-
ing nursed, washed and pam-
pered in a makeshift center that
looks like a MASH unit.

Only this hospital isn't for hu-
mans, it's for ducks and geese. By
Wednesday, 65 of the 80 birds
admitted had been treated and
released back to the wild. "

’’It looks very much like an
emergency room or an intensive
care unit in a special care hospi-
tal,” said Janet Rimmel of the Au-
dubon Society of Western
Pennsylvania. ”These are very
sick birds. They have all this oil
inside them.”

The hospital was set up in the
Beaver County Public Works
maintenance garage. ”Whisper”
signs caution visitors to be quiet
while nurses give intravenous
feedings, doses of medicine and
tub baths.

Oily birds are unable to float

and keep warm. They also swal-g ._  
low oil when they preen their"

feathers, leading to internal
damage and bleeding. Only
about 5 percent of those oiled in
such spills are treated, wildlife ex-
perts said.

An estimated 2,000 ducks and
geese died in Pennsylvania from
thejan. 2 spill of one million gal-
lons of diesel fuel into the
Monongahela and Ohio rivers,
according to the Pennsylvania
Game Commission. The 27 miles
of river from the broken Ashland
Oil Inc. tank to Pittsburghwere
devoid of ‘waterfowl for three
days following the spill.

’’It’s a tragedy. The birds co-
vered with oil lose their buoyan-
cy or they freeze to death. They
slowly sink like a submarine un-
til they disappear,” said Barry
Moore of the Pennsylvania Game
Commission.

Rehabilitated birds were taken
by truck to the Juniata River in

Bedford County, about 120 miles ‘

east of Pittsburgh.

Pitt students discover new cultures across the sea

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

The Semester at Sea and Study
Abroad programs at Pitt offer
more than just an academic ex-
perience in foreign lands. They
lend the opportunity for students

' to experience firsthand the many

different cultures of the world.
The two programs are similar in

their goals, but each uses a differ-

ent approach to achieve them.

Cindy Weinman, the assistant’

director for Study Abroad at Pitt
and the assistant director for in-
stitutional relations for Den-
mark’s International Study

program, said, ”The Study
Abroad program exposes a stu-
dent to one culture and one lan-
guage. They find that an
immersion process has taken
place, and they leave the coun-
try with an intimate knowledge of
it.

”In Semester at Sea, more of a
comparative, generalized view is
given to students as they travel
around the world,” said
Weinman. A

Paul Dobransky, a junior at Pitt,
went on his Semester at Sea last
fall.

’’Approximately 500 students
from around the world gathered

in Vancouver, British Columbia
at the start of our trip,” said
Dobransky. ”From there, we
went to 13 ports around the
world on a midsized cruise ship
that was specialized to suit our
needs/’

Dobransky also said, ”We took
classes both on and off of the
ship, however, our course work
tried to relate to our field work.

”I went out of the anthropolo-
gy department to study
philosophy and medicine around
the world,” added Dobransky,
”and was able to go into the jun-
gles of three countries and ob-

‘serve natives in their natural

Dobransky said he felt that

things has thelability to change,
and you can more fully develop

into your full self,” said
Dobransky.
Another student, Robin

Richardson, spent the first term of

her senior year in Denmark on a
study abroad program.
She said, ”There were about

300 of us [students] from the‘

United States and Canada study-

_ ing at the University of Copenha-

gen for four months."

Richardson, who is a business
major, said, ”The classes I took
were difficult, but not impossible.
I learned a lot of things you can't
learn in Pittsburgh. The Danish
have such a different perspective
than we do.

”One of the highlights of my
trip was a study tour that took me
to East ‘Germany, Poland and the
Soviet Union,” Richardson said.

Throwing away the key
to aman’s chastity belt

A convicted drug dealer from Philadelphia received an unusual sen-
tence yesterday. As part of his probation requirements, he is not to
engage in sex unless he marries. I

The man, Michael Youngblood, is the father of three bastard chil-
dren, whom he claims to support and seeoccasionally. Youngblood
became an FBI informant after his arrest, and the celibacy require-
ment was part of a lenient sentence requested by the prosecuting at-
torney. J

At first sight, the sentence seems laughable. Imagine trying to en-
force such a monumental tribute to stupidity. Would the man be
watched constantly, which is impossible, or would he need to en-
force the sentence himself? If the latter is to be the case, why impose
the sentence at all?

We have to wonder why the judge in question felt a need to im-
pose his beliefs about pre-marital sex on the defendant. Now that
there is a precedent to curtail the sexual behavior of a convicted drug
dealer, a man not on trial for any sex offense, how far is the jump
to limiting the sexual practices of much greater portions of the popu-
lation? ‘ ‘ .

Let's create a scenario. A man is convicted of drunk driving. Over
the course of the trial, it comes out that the man had been at a bar
to pursue the possibility of fornication. Let us also.assume that he
has a child out of wedlock. Should the man, unmarried, lose his right
to engage in sex with any consenting adult?

There were not any laws broken by the sentence, but the ramifica-
tions of such a ridiculous and inane sentence are truly frightening.
It seems that when the conditions of probation are imposed, a little
more attention should be paid to the offenses which brought the
offender to trial.

Hail, holy rock and roll

There is a new wave of whole-
someness that has washed upon
and re-baptized our native shores
of sin —— and it has manifested it-
self in the guise of rock 'n' roll.

Chief passivists of this silent
reformation include Stryper and
that toe-headed dimpled delight,
Debbie Gibson. Erstwhile fans of
George Michael who sipped their
mocktails in disgust at "l.Want
Your Sex,” have taken self-
righteous repose at Faith.

It seems suspiciously calculat-
ed that Michael would release a
cut whose teasing title is one of
the three heavenly virtues,
though it is extremely doubtful it
will become the wedding song of
the '90s the way Endless Love
was of thedead and buried-in-a-
runaway—disco—beat-forever '70s.

The founding mother of this
renaissance of ecclesiastical im-
agery, Amy Grant, has popula-
rized a new classification of
music- Behold, pop gurus,

M.O.R. listeners and heavy me-
tal maniacs, and make way for
the rock of Gibraltar.

Most of this puritanical rock is
not so blatant as Grant's,
however. Take, for instance,
Debbie Gibson. She's exactly
what America didn't know it
wanted.

I have yet to see any negative
reviews of her album or her style.
The message that is coming
across to me is: "But she writes
her own material. But she's so
damn cute. She's just sooo cute,
you know? And so innocent.”

But when a reviewer in the Vil-
lage Voice stated he preferred her
spunky Shake Your Love to Billy
Joel's (whom Debbie never miss-
es an opportunity to boast is her
mentor and idol) Only The Good

Die Young, I knew it was the end
of something. ‘
Perhaps it was the greatest pop

tart of them all, Madonna, who

was the catalyst to the formation
of this musical
counterculture. For those of you
who were appalled by her
pasties, nauseated by her navel
and outraged by her dreadfully
sacrilegious flaunting of religious
icons, there was an alternative.

While Billy Idol is fighting in

court to have his video for Hot in-

the City aired uncensored on
MTV, the Christian rock group
Stryper is getting more and more
airplay, parading as a heavy me-
tal band. Jesus!

If George Michael's new
release Father Figure is a hint to
what we can look forward to in
music, just take those old records
off the shelf, and I'll sit and listen
to them by myself. _

us simply became the idiots we
were destined to be, only more

When I was in college, a rela-

When I told him his sympathy

In his mind, through an acci-
dent of timing, we missed all the
excitement and self-discovery of
being a student in the 19605. Ad-
mittedly, in those days, mixed
with the militancy, exploding
sexuality and more apathy than
people are willing to remember,
were some grand ideas about
peace and freedom. But for those
of us who were children at the
time, somewhere along the line,
something went askew.

the possibility of ending up with

we've allowed ourselves to

I'd just shrug my shoulders, chalk
it up to fate and go back to read-
ing James Joyce. But experience
tells me that, though we've been
pummeled by a government and
society that care about as much
for the well-being of the minds of
its people (witness cuts i_n spend-
ing for education) as I do the
color of the walls in my base-
ment, we have not lost all. Some
leaders actually believe that to-

day's students and young profes-
sionals are satisfied by simply
reacting to their environments in-
stead of thinking about them. If
I thought this to be so, I'd be real-
ly depressed. But I know this to
be not only a false reading of the
situation, but a dangerously com-
placent one as well.

All that's happened, I believe,
is that while developing our
professional or public selves,
we've allowed our private selves
to atrophy. Over the long term,
this inevitably will lead to disil-
lusionment (check your history
books — it always has) as our
dreams of happiness being inex-
orably linked to affluence turn to
dust. Hopefully, we'll be resilient
enough to begin re-evaluating
and rebuilding our private selves.

To me‘, the key to rebuilding
what has been ravaged is educa-
tion. James O. Freedman, presi-
dent of Dartmouth College, has
made some waves in academic
circles with his views about the
dangers of not developing the pri-

vate self.

"I'm very concerned that one

thing liberal education does not ‘

sufficiently address the need for
students to develop both a private
self and a public self, and to find
a way to have those selves con-
verse with each other and form
the whole human being," Freed-
man explained to Edward B. Fisk
of The New York Times.

"We read, on all sides today,”
he said, "that students are entire-
ly interested in vocationalism and
careerism. If that's the case, those
students are not sufficiently de-
veloping the private self, a self
that can be alone at three o'clock
in the morning.”

Perhaps one day soon, we'll
wake up and realize that there is
as much to be gained from
thoughtful reflection as there is
from effective action. One
without the other just won't cut
it. Check your histdry books on
that one, too.

Stargell hopes to manage in major leagues

By Ben —Wa|ker

AP Baseball Writer

NEW YORK -— Willie Stargell,
the newest Hall of Famer, now
has another goal: to manage in
the major leagues.

’’I want to do it very much,”
Stargell said Wednesday, a day
after he became the 17th player
to be elected into baseball's
shrine on the first ballot.

’’I’m like a guy who goes to the
minor leagues, equips himself
and gets ready for the majors,”
Stargell said. ”But I have no
timetable for managing.”

Stargell, whose fame came as
a slugger with the Pittsburgh

Pirates, is preparing for his third
season as a coach with the Atlan-
ta Braves. He said he would wel-
come a chance to manage in the
winter leagues.

There are no minority
managers in the majors. Commis-
sioner Peter Ueberroth, who

i greeted Stargell at a press confer-

ence Wednesday, has said
repeatedly that blacks and

V Hispanics should get more op-

portunities. ,

Only a handful of players have
managed in the majors after be-
ing elected to the Hall of Fame,
and none has enjoyed much suc-
cess. Ted Williams, Rogers
Hornsbv and Frankie Frisch are

3-point range, leads

Panthers over UConn

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

The Pitt Panthers didn’t‘expect
a tough basketball game from
Connecticut last night, and it
showed. But Charles Smith woke
up in the second half, Sean Miller
got hot and Connecticut Coach
Jim Calhoun got mad, as the Pan-
thers escaped Fitzgerald Field
House with a 61-58 win before
a capacity crowd of 6,798.

”lt was one of those games.
Everybody was laid back. We
tried to get the momemtum go-
ing but it was hardto do," Smith
said.

The win moved Pitt (ranked
sixth by The Associated Press) to
2-1 in the Big East and 12-1 over-
all. Connecticut dropped to 1-3
in the league and 8-4 overall.

Smith, who was held without
a field goal for the first 34
minutes, scored on a pass from
Miller with :09, giving Pitt its fi-
nal two points and a three-point
edge, 61-58.

The game‘wasn’t decided un-
til Smith knocked away a Con-
necticut inbounds pass at
halfcourt with one second left on
the clock. 1

”Nothing went right for us. The
good thing is we came out with
a win,” he said.

The game was tied, 42-42, with
8:21 left when Sean Miller hit a

Huskies

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

The Lady Panthers’ basketball
team outscored, outrebounded,
and generally outplayed the Con-
necticut Huskies lastnight.

In fact, they even held 6-foot—1
senior center and Big East pre-
season player-of-the-year Renee
Najarian to two field goals.

In the first half, that is.

A second half letdown again
struck Coach Kirk Bruce's squad
as the Lady Panthers surrendered
36 second-half points in a disap-
pointing 62-56 loss to the
Huskies at Fitzgerald Field
House. ‘

3-pointer, to give Pitt the lead.

The Panthers went into a press
and got the ball on a traveling
violation by Robert Ursery. Cal-
houn, incensed because he
thought the officials missed afoul
on Demetreus Gore, ran onto the
floor and was hit with a techni-
cal foul. Another one soon
followed.

Miller hit the four technical foul
shots, expanding Pitt's lead to
eight points, 52-44.

Smith added two foul shots and
Pitt appeared safe with a 54-44
lead and only 5:34 remaining.

Calhoun said he was wrong to
pick up the second technical, but
he didn't think his temper took
his team out of the game.

”Why should (the technicals)
bother me. We got the next six
calls in a row,” he said.

With Pitt leading 59-53, Phil
Gamble hit a 3-pointer and Tate
George scored on a duck-in
layup, cutting the deficit to one,
59-58.

Pitt had the ball and called
timeout with :15 left and only five
ticks on the shot clock. _

But with Cliff Robinson and Jeff
King out of the game due to fouls,
the Huskies had no one to cover
Smith down low.

Smith hit a bank shot over Wil-
lie McCloud and Pitt had escaped
with a victory on a night when

’’I don't know what's happen-

ing —- it's hard to explain,” a con-
fused Bruce said after his team's
fifth straight loss. ”Prior to the
game, we want to win so bad we
can taste it. Then we just tighten
up.” ;
At halftime, the Lady Panthers
had control of the game, leading
36-26 after a 16-6 spurt, includ-
ing nine unanswered points. ”We
should be able to win comforta-
bly with a 10-point lead at hal-
ftime,” Bruce said.

But after the half, the same un-
explainable problem that has
plagued the Lady Panthers in re-
cent games’ reared it's ugly head
again.

among those who have struggled
in the dugout while their golden
plaques hung in the Hall.

Stargell was honored for a
21-year career with 475 home
runs, 1,540 RBI and a .282 aver-
age. He was also the Pirates’ lead-
er in the clubhouse, where he
presided over ”The Family” and
played a key role in two World
Series championships.

”l've always . felt hard work
earns results,” Stargell said. ”This
is an overwhelming feeling.”

Stargell was named on 352 of
427 ballots (82.4 percent) in vot-
ing by the Baseball Writers As-
sociation of America. He was the
only candidate who received the

Part of the problem was a
second-half break in the Pitt
defense that allowed UConn
freshman guard Laura Lishness 14
second-half points, 6 on uncon-
tested layups. She finished with
16 points, one of four Connec-
ticut players in double figures.

Also scoring in double figures
for UConn was senior forward
Krista Blomquist with 10 points,
senior guard Jill Brumbaugh with
10 points and Najarian with 17.

With the score tied at 54 late
in the second half and Pitt hold-
ing their destiny in their collec-
tive hands, Tabatha Long, Deidra
Baker and Connie Hurt all missed
the front ends of consecutive one-

required 75 percent, which was
321 votes, and was the first to
make it on his rookie ballot since
Willie McCovey in 1986..

Stargell said he tried not to wor-
ry about whether he would be
elected on his first try.

‘'1 didn't allow myself to get
that high with my expectations,”
he said. ’’I just felt that if it was
meant to be this year, then it
would be. If not, then sometime
down the road.”

”Now, I'm feeling the effects of
not having to wonder each year
whether I'll make it.”

Then, breaking into his familiar
big smile: ’’I thought if they
looked at my. stolen-base total

and-one opportunities. Pitt then
spotted the Huskies (9-6, 2-3) a
four point lead with only 1:03 to
play.

Despite the loss, which leaves
the Lady Panthers at 0-4 in the
Big East and 6-7 overall, Pitt
seemed to play it's most intense
game of the season. Bruce rotat-
ed his five inside players in and
out of the game to try and frus-
trate UConn’s Najarian.

”Renee’s a tough player,”
Bruce said. ”She’|| go after it, go
after it, go after it. I planned to use
all the big girls to stop her,”
Bruce continued, referring to his
combination of Lorri Johnson,

[17], they could leave me out.”

Stargell will be inducted July
31 during ceremonies in Cooper-
stown, N.Y. He said he will not
write an acceptance speech and
instead ”will let itjust come out."

Stargell learned of his election
Tuesday night at his home in At-
lanta and caught a flight to New
York. He-was hugging his daugh-
ters Precious and Dawn at the
news conference Wednesday
and planned to go on to
Pittsburgh. . -

He will be honored there
Thursday at a luncheon. The
Pirates have already given him a
crystal clock engraved with his
election date.

The quintet shut down Najari-

five field goals. Conversely, they
also provided scoring opportuni-

bined for 17 personal fouls.

Sheerer finished the game with

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January 14, I988

"I've never seen a worse piece
of yellow journalism in my life. "

— Rollie Massimino’s opinion
of The Pitt News after the Pan-
thers defeated his Villanova Wild-
cats at Fitzgerald Field House last
Feb. 23.

It's that time again. Rollie, Dou-
gie and the boys are coming to
town Saturday night for a show-
down with Paul Evans’ Panthers.

It wasn't suppossed to be a
showdown, but I've got to give
Rollie credit. He's doing a won-
derful coaching job. No wonder
Rollie thinks he's the greatest

a coach in the world.

He's not looking forward to this
game, though.

Pittsburgh is probably the only
Big East city where Rollie doesn't
feel right at home.

As I most hoop afficionados
know, Rollie and Dougie aren't

S well liked around the city of
Pittsburgh.

Need I rehash the events of the
last few seasons?

Good, I wasn't planning on it.

I thought I'd fill Rollie in on
what's new.

Dear Rollie,

Congrats! Your team looks su-
per. Tom Greis is probably the
most improved player in the
league. Maybe this time he'll get

off the ground when he and
Charles Smith go up for a re-
bound. You remember Smith
don't you? You almost had him,
Rollie. What happened?

And Dougie looks good also. I

JOHN
ENRIGI-I'I'

caught the St. John's game, and
he looks like he's asserting him-
self more this year. But Pitt fans
are still glad he decided on your
wonderfully clean program rather
than playing for Dr. Roy
Chipman.

If Dougie came to Pitt, Jerome
Lane would have ended up at
Ohio State or Oklahoma. Yeah,
Rollie. I know Dougie’s a nice
guy and a goodplayer. But would
you really pick him over a Jerome
Lane? I hope not, Rollie.

Gee, come to think of it, Rol-
lie, you've had a lot of class play-
ers in your program. Speaking of
class, how's Gary McClain do-
ing? What a class act he is. I guess
Gary's another fine example of
the kind of quality people you
bring out of your program.

I heard Eric Leslie left school.
Why, Rollie? Yeah, I know he's
a 6-foot-3 guard who couldn't
handle the ball worth a damn.

But I thought you must have seen
some superior quality in him that
no other rec; ;iters could see. I'm
sorry to hear that, Rollie.

Gee, it must be tough for you
guys to scrimmage with only
eight or nine players. You had
two recruits last year. Bobby Mar-
tin ended up with your second
favorite team, and Delino
DeShields is playing baseball.

What do you guys do in prac-
tice, Rollie? I heard you throw on
your Chuck Taylors once in a
while and scrimmage with the
guys. Is that true, Rollie? I hope
not. I wou.ln't want you to show
up at the Field House looking
emaciated because of too much
practice and not enough pasta.

Rollie, I know you probably
don't want to hear about this, but
I just can't resist giving you the
scoop.

Bobby Martin looks good. He's
no Charles Smith, but he'll be a
dandy before he's through.

I hope the fans don't give Bob-
by a hard time down at your
place. What's that new place
called, Rollie? The duPont Pavil-
ion. It sure looks like a ski lodge
to me.

Getting back to my point, I
heard the fans were really hard
on Martin at the McDonald's All-
America game at Villanova last

spring.

A letter to Rollie, a real swell guy

I hope you'll tell your fans to
clean up their act. I mean, look
how congenial Panther fans have
been to you and Dougie the past
two years.

Plus, Rollie, you seem to think
you have a pretty good idea
about what college athletics
should and shouldn't be. It would
be nice if you would try to
remember that when your stu-
dent body starts acting up on Feb.
13.

I sincerely hope there are no
hard feelings toward The Pitt
News because of the last two
years. We really like you, Rollie.
We're thinking of making you an
honorary member of our fraterni-
ty, Theta Nu Gamma. Stands for
The Nice Guys, Rollie, and boy,
you're really swell.

I got to run, Rollie. Have fun at
Fitzgerald Saturday.

And don't be upset with us. I
mean, Rollie, what do you expect
from yellow journalists anyway?

And Rollie, please do me two
favors. Would you refrain from
smoking one of those god-awful
cigars if you win Saturday night?
The stench is really annoying.

And start playing that Enright
kid a little more. He's a good-
looking guy and class all the way.

Sincerely,
John Enright

Wrestlers set for upcoming meets

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt wrestling team doesn't
have any time to rest these days.
In the span of five days they have
two tough matches.

Thursday night, the Panthers
square Off against Morgan State,
followed by Eastern Wrestling
League rival and national power
Lehigh on Monday night. Both
meets take place at Fitzgerald
Field House and begin at 7:30.

”The easiest thing for us to do
is look past Morgan State,” said
Pitt head coach Rande Stott-
lemyer. ”We can't do that,
though. Lehigh is obviously the

bigger of the two matches, but if
we don't watch ourselves, it
could be a bad night.”

The Panthers will stay basical-
ly with the same lineup, the only
exception being at 126 pounds,
where Matt Gerhard will replace
freshman Sean Moffit.

Pitt is currently 2-0 in dual
matches. They dominated Frank-
lin & Marshall 48-0 and Waynes—
burg 46-0. A

”These upcoming matches
shouldn't be the same,” said
Stottlemyer. ”We have to watch-
out for ourselves.”

Panther All-American Pat San-
toro will put his 28-0 record on
the line at the 142 pounds divi-

sion. Santoro is ranked No. 1 in
his division by the Amateur
Wrestling News and has been
dominating every match in which
he has competed.

”I think that I'll be a little ner-
vous going into the Lehigh
match,” said Santoro. ”As for
Morgan State, I really don't know
who I'll be facing. I'll just have to
go out and wrestle my best. It
should be fun’... I'm looking for-
ward to wrestling.”

The key to the Lehigh meet will
be the four upperweight classes.
The Panthers should be able to
hold their Own early, but
whoever can get the upper hand
late in the meet should win.

’’If somebody would tell me
right now that we have a split in
the last four matches, I'd have to
say that we won the meet,” said
Stottlemyer. ”We have had pret-
ty good success against Lehigh in
recent years, so they are going to
want to kick Our butts.”

One of the key matches will be
Mike Tongel at 177.

”Lehigh is the tougher team,”
said Tongel. ”But that doesn't
mean that we can concentrate on
them. Every team has a few good
individuals; that's what you have
to look out for.”

”Everybody has to do their job
this week,” said Stottlemyer. ’’It
should be a good one.” A

Game

Continued from page 6

their play called for defeat.

”We didn't get a whole lot of
good performances. Sean Miller
did well, Darelle Porter played
good defense and Demetreus
played well at times,” Pitt Coach
Paul Evans said.

That was a good thing because
Smith and Jerome Lane weren't at
the top of their games.

Lane scored nine points and

grabbed 10 rebounds, two below
his average. Smith finished with
1.4 points, but shot only two of
eight from the field. He hit 10 of
13 foul shots.

Said Evans: ”[Smith] really did
struggle. His shots were rolling
on him. He was falling away a lit-
tle bit and looking for fouls. He
really didn't play a good game.”

The real hero for Pitt was

A Miller, who came out of his three-

point shooting slump. Miller
hadn't made one since the se-
cond half of the Georgetown
game.

He hit four of nine from 3-point
range, and those were all the
shots he took. He also sank the
four technical shots and finished
with 16 points and four assists.
Miller was the only Pitt player
who played all 40 minutes.

Other Panthers weren't so for-
tunate. ”(Coach Evans) was rotat-
ing players as they were making
mistakes on the flOor,” Smith
said.

 Smith himself was pulled out
two times early in the second

half.

Robinson, Connecticut's lead-
ing scorer, hit on eight of the
Huskies first 10 points.

Connecticut was ahead 12-4
when Lane asserted himself on
the boards. He scored two quick
baskets to pull Pitt to within four,
12-8. -
Connecticut responded with a
bank shot by George and Ursery
added a field goal to expand the
Huskies lead to 16-10. .

The Panthers outscored Con-

necticut, 6-3, in the next four
minutes as Miller .hit two
3—point__ers.

After the Huskies’ King made a
foul shot, Pitt went on a 12-4 run
to close out the half.

PANTHER NOTES: Robinson
led Connecticut with 19 points
and George added 10  Gore
had 14 for Pitt  Smith is now
fifth on Pitt's all-time scoring list
with 1,684  The Panthers next
game is Saturday night at Fitzger-
ald (8:00 p.m.) against Villanova.

Cher finds
celestial
inspiration

By Robin Shepherd

Staff Writer

From the opening credits,
when the strains of Dean Martin
crooning the seductive but silly
”That’s Amore!” fill the theater,
one gets the sense that Moon-
struck will be a tongue—in—cheek
romantic comedy. in this affec-
tionate look at New York's Little
Italy, the affairs of several gener-
ations of a family are examined
in a warm and humorous light.

Directed by veteran Norman
Jewison (Fiddler on the Roof, And
justice for All), the film's plot
centers around a young widow,
Loretta Castorini. Played by Cher
(most recently seen in Suspect),
Loretta agrees to marry her suitor,
Johnny (Danny Aiello) out of a
sense of boredom and a need for
change in her life.

However, when he leaves to
visit his ailing mother in Sicily,
she meets and is immediately
swept off her feet by his strange
one~handed brother, Ronny,
played by Nicholas Cage. Mean-
while, her own father is having
an affair with a younger woman,
and her mother enjoys an even-
ing out with ayoung professor.

While the story itself sounds a
bit mottled and slow-paced, the
movie runs smoothly because of
its sincerity and its knowing use
of rich details about New York’s
Italian culture. From the bakery
where Ronny works to the neigh-
borhood restaurant where the
characters dine, every nuance is
captured.

Moonstruck’s main attributes
lie in its rich portrayal of charac-
ters, which result both from John
Patrick Shanley’s witty script and
from the outstanding perfor-
mances by nearly every actor in
the film.

Vincent Gardenia and Feodor
Chaliapin as Loretta’s father and
grandfather, respectively, are
among the many performers in
the movie who manage to hu-
morously perpetuate the stereo-
types of ltalian—Americans
without seeming offensive.

Veteran stage actress Olympia
Dukakis, playing Loretta’s

mother, gives a funny but also’

touching performance that makes
us look forward to seeing more of
her on the screen. Nicholas Cage,
while still speaking in that weird
nasal tone he used in Peggy Sue
got Married, brings the. right
touch of charismatic eccentricity
to his role. Cage proves himself
best at making seemingly offbeat
characters endearing in this fol-
lowup to Raising Arizona.

But the real attraction here is
Cher, once again demonstrating
that she is one of the most intrigu-
ing and dynamic actresses cur-
rently working. In her per-
formance as Loretta, she displays
the right balance of complacent
acceptance of her fate along with
the wistful romanticism that
causes her to fall in love with

 Venture into the noisyworld of Negativland

"5"w:::~»r -:'>"*~‘* st‘

Negativland
Escape From Noise
SST

Once upon a time, SST was
known as a premier label of
punk—surf-garage rock. Noise gui-
tars were king, and such luminar-
ies as Black Flag, Minutemen,
Meat Puppets and Sonic Youth
reigned supreme. Cult favorite
Husker Du even managed to

make the leap to a record deal I

with the majors.

Now that hundreds of other
labels have begun feeding noiz-
rock imitations to their over-
stuffed audience, SST has
sensibly stayed a step ahead by
diversifying in experimental
directions.

The trend began with the

., release of albums by improvisers

Paper Bag and avant-gardist Elliot
Sharp and culminates with the
newest record from the wackiest
characters in California's Contra
Costa County, the irrepressible

foursome known as Negativland,

whose name is derived from a F

piece by the '70s German ex-
perimentalists Neu!.

Veteran followers of indepen-
dent music will remember
Negativland’s 1983 classic A Big

70-8 Place, released on their own '

Seeland label. The title magnum
opus, a 15-minute, mind-bending
excursion through the sewers and
writhing innards of California
suburbs, was an overwhelming
favorite on WRCT, Carnegie Mel-
Ion’s radio station.

The group next completed a
cassette called ]amCon 84,
documenting a gathering of
amateur radio airwave jammers.

In the preparation of their first
release on a big independent
label, the members of Negativ-

land experienced an unexpected ’

setback when their apartment
caught fi re. However, in an act of
now-legendary courage, they
managed to save not only their
cat but also their master tapes.

Such good old American hero-
ism made the wait for new
material a fruitful one. Escape
From Noise, their fifth effort, con-
tinues the logical continuity from
previous releases. Tape loops and
audio collages remain an integral
part of their sound, and the
whimsical humor and the nasal
voice of David Wills are as per-
vasive as ever.

The Negativ guys turn the plas-
tic container of suburbia on its
ear and shake out the crusty in-
festations of conformity. The
purification process involves a
thorough drubbing of sell-out
stuporstars in ”Micae| Jackson”
and a shredding of familiar,
parochial ideologies in ”Chris-

ment is a hyperdisco smash
scientifically manufactured for
maximum hit potential, parody-
ing the obsession with
meticulous perfection that drains
all emotion out of many commer-
cial hits.

The crucial difference between
Escape From Noise and prior
Negativland offerings lies in the
technological wizardry and high-
quality production. Beat-oriented
tracks alternate with folk tunes,
tape manipulation and other tom-
foolery to create a succession of
vignettes that will evoke a wry,
understanding grin from almost

anyone. Negativland goes forthe _

throat of pop music itself in an at-
tempt to change the very nature
of ”accessibility.”

As far as radio is concerned, Es-
cape From Noise has already
made progress in achieving that
goal. Locally, the record has
reached the No. I spot on WRCT
and has been in medium rotation
at WPTS. Negativland recently

cracked the College Music Jour-
nal Top 10.

”We’ve even received reports
of airplay from commercial sta-
tions,” enthuses band member
Mark Hosler. All this exposure
leads to pressure to produce a
live show, no small task for such.
complicated arrangements.

Previously, Negativland
presented performance-"art hap-
penings along the West Coast
andoffered live radio broadcasts
via phone lines. Now they are
contemplating a national tour in
the spring, and if we're lucky
enough, Pittsburgh could be in-
cluded on their itinerary.

With an acclaimed SST album

under their belt, the boys from M

Contra Costa County could move
in any conceivable direction.
Doubtless, they will continue to
chart unknown experimental
waters. From here on, the posi-
tive force of Negativland can only

' become more powerful.

Richard Vuu appears as Pu Yi in the film The Last Emperor.

By Bob Thomas

Associated Press Writer

It had to be a filmmaker’s
dream. After lengthy negotia-
tions, the renowned ltalian direc-
tor, Bernardo Bertolucci, won
permission to film inside Beijing’s
Forbidden City. The splendor and
the majesty of that fabled place
(9,999 rooms on 250 acres) are
captured in Bertolucci’s The Last
Emperor.

The story traces the amazing
history of Pu Yi, proclaimed em-
peror of China in 1908 when he

'was 3 years old. History soon
overtook the imperial throne, and
at 6, he became a powerless resi-
dent of the Forbidden City, at-
tended by hundreds of eunuchs.

Political turmoil caused Pu Yi
and his two wives to be banished
in 1924, and he embarked on a
playboy’s life among the interna-
tional party set. In 1931, he ac-

cepted the Japanese offer to
become the puppet ruler of in-
vaded Manchuria. The Russians
captured him at the end of World
War II, and he was sent to Red
China in 1950 for a decade of in-
doctrination. He ended his years
as a gardener in Beijing, where
he once ruled. Death came in
1967.

Bertolucci is an expert in epic
tales, as witness 1900. The Last
Emperor offered a greater
challenge: telling a long and
‘varied life against the complexi-
ties of war and revolution in the
Far East. Bertolucci’s camera
magnificently captu res the scene.
His script, written with Mark Pep-
loe, is less successful.

The first third of The Last,Em—
peror stuns the eye. The opulence
of the Forbidden City, the mass-
es of eunuchs, the ornamented
costumes are almost overwhelm-
ing. There is added fascination

with the customs of the imperial
court. Bertolucci overlooks
nothing.

The story is told in flashbacks
as Pu Yi (John Lone) is interrogat-
ed by a stern but compassionate
prison governor (Ying Ruocheng).
The device helps relieve some of
the historial confusion. But noth-
ing can offset the fact that Pu’Yi’s
later life was depressingly sordid

1 and useless.

The young emperors (Richard
Vuu, Tijger Tsou, Wu Tao) per-
form admirably, and Lone is one
of the most riveting actors in the
trade. Joan Chen is adept in the
sketchily written role of the em-
press. Peter O'Toole appears
briefly as the boy’s tutor.

Jeremy Thomas produced the

mammothundertaking, a remarl‘.

able achievement in itself. The
Columbia release is rated PG13,
perhaps for some nudity, sexual
goings-on and violence.

Women take a place
behind the camera

By Susan Washburn

Showcase Editor

A collaboration of Pittsburgh
institutions is examining the
cinematic trends in representing
the social, sexual and cultural
relationships between ‘men and
women in the series Women be-
hind the Camera.

Sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museum of
Art, Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Car-
negie Mellon, Chatham College,
B|oomer’s Restaurant and WYEP,
Women Behind the Camera
brings to light the criticisms and
movements that have resulted
from the representation of wom-
en in mainstream cinema.

Featured in the series are wom-
en who have taken a place in the
male-dominated industry of
directing and filmmaking. The
program of films, lectures and
visits asserts that the representa-
tion of women must be negotiat-
ed, contested and changed to
assert fundamental human and
political values.

”These women have taken on
the challenge of defining their
own roles, contesting what men
have defined them as,” said
Shekhar Deshpande, a communi-
cations professor at Chatham Col-
lege and coordinator for the
series.

Women behind the Camera is
a semester-long program with
screenings and lectures through-
out the city. Works featured
throughout January are being
shown at the Carnegie Museum
of Art for $3. Films shown this
month are: ~

housewife and part-time prosti-
tute. It studies the obsessive daily
routine performed with the per-
fection and elegance of a
Japanese tea ceremony. .

The Girl — Jan. 23.

An award winning film, The

who longs to know more about
her family and eventually con-
fronts her natural mother.

Syntagma examines how the
body, particularly the woman's

change, chaos, child-rearing,

Leather Nun changing old habits

I don't think I was all that bad
in 1987. I mean, my grades were
all right if you don't count the C +
in organic. Anyway, it seems that
I was a recipient of Santa's dis-
favor. Instead of ashes, I was sen-
tenced to a musical hell. Under
the tree, much to my fearful sur-
prise, was a trilogy of foul albums
by Bananarama, Samantha Fox

‘and Leather Nun.

The first thing that came to my
mind was that these albums must
be pretty good. An undiscovered
treasure trove. Well, I was wrong.
About as wrong as a person could
be.

Bananarama’s latest offering,
Wow, is incredibly weak. The
songs are drum-machine dirges
lacking any depth or creativity.
The Bananas haven't even come
up with anything nearly as catchy
as ’’Cruel Summer” or even

"‘”’Robert DeNero’s waiting.”

One of the main problems with
this album is that these girls
should learn how to sing. I find
it really difficult to get into three

voices singing uninteresting
melodies in unison.

Next ‘up was the wonderfully
weIl—greased Samantha Fox's
sophomore album. The former
page-three girl slaughters most of
the album's tuneless offerings.

LEE
SI-IARRA

Her vocals lack any of the over-
production that made last year's
”Touch Me” so tolerable. The
sparkling clean production re-
veals her voice as the stump it is.
The cover is an attractive photo-
graph of Samantha falling out of

her leather jacket. But that

doesn't even save her wretched
version of the Stones’ classic
”Satasfaction.”

By now, you would have prob-
ably thought that I’d had enough;
well, you are wrong. With the de-
termination of a devout S&Mer,
I jumped at Leather Nun's Force
of Habit. The cover shot of an in-

nocent young lady tied to a sur-
gical table detailed the way I was
feeling at this point.

Figuring that the last would
probably be the best, I was grave-
Iy mistaken. This album was sup-
posed to be a compilation of the
Nun's best songs intended to win
an American market. Unfor-
tunately, everything they play
sounds strikingly familiar.

Two of the songs sound like
bad Nico era Velvet Under-
ground. ”Pink House” sounds
like a cross between the Doors’
”L.A. Woman” and the Scorpi-
ons’ ”Rot chew like ah hurrican.”
Ifl had to limit my description of
their music to one word, ”bor-
ing” would definitely qualify.

It's Christmas presents like
these that make me want to be-
lieve that Santa isn't real after all.
In a vain attempt to recover my
sensibilities, I went out and
bought Sonic Youth’s Sister and
Fleetwood Mac's Tango in the
Night. If I’m going to listen to
straight pop and alternative mu-
sic, I want to listen to the best.

So why just type your documents when they can
look printed and ready to publirh with Electronic
Publishing? It’ll cost only a little more, but it’s
worth it! Your work will command the attention
it deserves.

 

Select what’s appropriate for your work from
over 50 typefaces. We can even scan your typed
text and set it into type, without the need for
retyping. We’re professionals with heavy-duty
hardware 8: software capabilities for the most
sophisticated documents including headers,
footers, footnotes, index, table of contents, pic-
turs and line art — all to produce anything
from -books to newsletters to directories.

Yes, we’ll do word processing in a typewriter
font if you insist, but you won’t"want it when
you see typesetting oﬂ‘ a laser printer. Call Ted:
