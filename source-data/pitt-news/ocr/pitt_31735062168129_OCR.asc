1 "The bulk of the energies of the
"Faculty of Arts and Sciences

Council (FASC) members was ex—

erted in the discussion of the pro-
posed 10 per cent cutback of teach-
ing assistants (TA) for next year.
Dr. Jerome L. Rosenberg, newly
appointed dean of the Faculty of

_Arts and Sciences, presided.

At the inception of Friday’s
meeting, Mike Fabricant, the stu-
dent representative on the Coun-

 cil, motioned that special consi-

deration be given to TA and teach-

 ing, fellows and also to the Uni-
 versity’s position on 1199, the un-

ion now vying with Local 29 to rep-

 resent the hospital workers. Af-

ter a brief discussion. it was

 agreed to include these items on

the agenda for the day.

_.,Faculty Of Arts" And Sciences

Council Debates. TA Situation

evoked the discussion that even-
tually dealt with the TA situation.
It seems that the University. has
fallen behind in the faculty-student
ratio. Dr. Rosenberg noted that it
is necessary to hold back on any
faculty or non-faculty increments
until the Governor comes through
with the money.

He also said that the University
hasn't been able to provide the ex-
pansion necessary and it isn't pos-
sible to give the Advising Center
the increase in staff that it needs.
although there has been a modest
improvement. Said Rosenberg.
"We have had to defer for further
consideration . . . there are too
many uncertainties."

Dr. Rosenberg stated that there
were a lot of worthwhile demands
to be considered and then listed a
three point order of /priorities. The

first was a firm commitment to

the undergraduates of the Univer-
sity to provide the instruction
needed in recitation and labs.

The second dealt with a moral
commitment to the graduate stu-
dents who are brought in on sup-
port with the implied promise that
an assistantship or a fellowship
will be available for the number
of years that a student pursues a
graduate course of study.

The relationship between the
University's limited budget and
the TA situation composed the
third point. Dr. Rosenberg empha-
sized the need for a readjustment
in both the number of TA‘s sup-
ported by the University and the
load that each TA will be required
to handle. stating that full utiliza-
tion of each TA would probably
lead to an equalization of loads de-
pending on each individual depart-
ment.

"The Chancellor wants to wait
for the governor's proposal in
Harrisburg."said Rosenberg.

ets. I'm sold out on money. . . . We

have not gone back on any com-
mitments. . . . We want to main-
tain credibility. . . . I do not want
to make any promises that I can't
keep." He also mentioned that
there would be no reduction in the
ratio of TA‘s available for stu-
dents in the classrooms.

At this point. Joshua C-hasen. a
TA in the History Department and
a visitor at the FASC meeting. in-
terjected his opinion that more
money is needed for TA‘s. He em-
phasized the point that the cur-
rent cutback in numbers is cutting
off the livelihoods of many grad-
uate students.

Dr. Rosenberg responded by
saying that the Chancellor has to
balance all legitimate demands in
the University, and it is difficult
to say what facet of education
‘must have priority over another.
He mentioned that the Chancellor
also has constraints. “We all have
to-accept responsibility for/the
constraints of society,” stated
Rosenberg. “The general society
to which we owe our alligience is
stingy.” -

Another visitor. Dr. Jerome B.
Schneewind. Dean of the College
of Arts and Sciences. then said
that putting the teacher-student
ratio above other things should be
taken into consideration. noting
that the time to reduce the num-
ber of TA‘s is not now because
there will be no cutback in the
number’ _of undergraduate, stu-
dents in the fall of 1970.

The discussion continued with-
Dr. Robert Newman of the Speech
Department outlining four levels
of concern in dealing with the TA

_ situation and other areas of the

University's financial woes. In-
clusive were (1) the size of the

-budget: (2) the share available for

Arts and Sciences «noting that the
legislature is more interested in
the University's professional
schools: (3) the division of‘ the

monies within the College of Arts
and Sciences: and (4) the use of
the monies in the CAS.

The lengthy discussion ended
simply with the unanimous ap-
proval of a motion by Dr. Newman
to invite Chancellor Posvar and
Edison Montgomery to the next
meeting. The purpose of their
presence will be to discuss over-
all institutional priorities. includ-
ing the TA situation. tuition and
enrollment.

Following the FASC’s endorse-
ment of the by-laws for the School
of General Studies, the Council
moved to the University’s position
on the hospital workers and the
proposed union. At this time there
was barely a quorum left, and the
ensuing discussion was, at best,
sketchy.

Dr. David Montgomery. a mem-
ber of the Council and also one of
the organizers of 1199. ‘gave a
brief resume of the situation and
the University’s position. After a
proposal by Dr. Rosenberg to con-
sult University lawyers. Dr. Mont-
gomery motioned to endorse the
principle of free election.

The passage of this motion con- ‘

cluded the two and a half hour
meeting. a meeting that resulted
in an invitation to the Chancellor
and Mr. Montgomery for a discus-
sion. an endorsement of the by-
laws of the School of General
Studies. and the endorsement of
the principle of free election for
the hospital workers.

There are rats, mice, and

of the Cathedral of Learning.
Paul Hensler, head of the Com-

students have left candy wrap-
pers and food remnants on the
floor and in’ corners, causing

the rodents to gather.

"This can become a real health
problem soon.“ Hensler com-
mented. “The "people from Quo
Vadis won’t even go into the kitch-
en behind the elevators because
there are so many mice in there.
It seems that the rats and mice
are nesting in the cracks and holes
in the walls. "

Hensler added that he doubted
that the University had called in
an exterminator yet. but he will
meet with Executive Vice Chan-
cellor Jack E. Freeman later this

"week to take action on the rodent

problem. Trash cans will be

 FAS To Vote on Council’s Recommendation

 

CAS Council Passes Crmliiig Proposals

Following is the text of the
grading system proposal passed
by the College of Arts and Sci-
ences Council last Thursday. The
Councils recommendation will be
voted on by the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences April 9.

WHEREAS

——the methods of evaluation used
in undergraduate courses are of
central importance in influenc-
ing the nature and quality of the
education acquired by students:

—the results of evaluation. when
properly transmitted serve
many vital purposes, such as in-
forming students of their abili-
ty and their progress. helping
faculty and others to judge the
student's potential for further
work in specific areas. and cer-
tifying to the university the stu-
dents progress toward a de-
gree: and

—a certain degree of uniformity
of practice in applying methods
of evaluation and in recording
the results is necessary both if
these purposes are to be served
and if equity in treatment of stu-
dents is to be protected:

THEREFORE BE IT
ENACTED THAT

(1) Each student shall have a
transcript recording all grades in
courses in which credit is award-
ed.

(2) There shall be two options
for 'evaluations,that must be en-
tered on the transcript: (A) the
Letter Grade System, and (B) the
Credit—No Entry System.

(A) Letter grades shall be as
follows:

A‘: superior attainment
B: meritorious attainment
C: satisfactory work

force,

D: below average. but not incom-
petent work

F: failure to do work of even min-
imal competence

G: work incomplete. for reasons
beyond the students control*

I; work incomplete. further re-
search in progress*

W: withdrawal from course with
no penalty and no credit
(B) The Credit-No Entry Grade

shall be as follows:

S: credit awarded for at least
minimally competent work done
in course.

No entry shall be made for less
than minimally competent work
done in course.

Courses for which an S is received
are not counted in QPA.

(3) The Normal Progress Re-
quirement passed by FAS on Jan-
uary 31. 1970. shall remain in
as shall the traditional
rules governing the calculation of
quality point averages and the
minimum allowable cumulative
QPA. '

(4) Subject to the restrictions
provided in Paragraph 8. there
shall be no numerical limit to the
number of courses a student may
elect to take on a Credit—No Entry
basis.

(5) Students shall decide at the
time of registration which grad-
ing system they wish to.use in a
given course. This decision may
not be changed, nor may a grade
of one kind awarded for a course
be replaced by a grade of the other
kind for that course.

(6) Eligibility for mention on
the Dean's List shall be restrict-
ed to students who have earned
grades of A. B. C. D. or F in at

least 12 credits during the term _.

Tom Rush seems to have
made a career of exposing talented
new song writers. For instance, he
sang Joni Mitchell"s songs years
before she recorded them herself. ,
He also picked up on a young writer
named James Taylor, whom The
Beatles later signed to Apple.

Tom‘s new album is brim-
ming with his latest discoveries. _

‘ Murray McLaughlin, whom Tom
met in Canada, contributed“Child‘s
. Song’_’and “Old Man Song.“David-
Whilfen,_another Canadian, is repre-

for which the List is published.
The criteria for actual inclusion
on the List shall be established by
the Dean of CAS.

(7) While no student can be re-
fused the option of taking any
course on a Credit—No Entry basis.
departments may feel that some
of their courses are of such a na-
ture that they should not be graded
on the letter-grade system. In
such cases. departments may re-
quest permission from CASC to
give the course solely on a Credit-
No Entry basis.

(8) Departments shall have the
option of deciding how many de-
partmental courses. if any. may
count toward a major when taken
on a Credit-No Entry basis.**

(9) An optional method of re-
cording evaluations shall be es-
tablished to supplement the man-
datory transcript. This method
shall be called the Portfolio
method.,Each student shall be en-
couraged to accumulate a variety

of kinds of evidence of academic

and personal growth and achieve-
ment. e.g.. samples of academic
work such as term papers. reports
of experiments. paintings. or rec-
ords of musical performances;
evaluations by various members
of the academic community. or by
efnployers and others who may

know the student well. etc. The —-

student shall determine the con-
tents of his portfolio and shall ex-
ercise over its transmission to
anyone outside the college the
same complete control he shall
have over the transmission of his
transcript. The CAS shall offer as
much aid as it can to students in
maintaining portfolios.

(10) It shall be incumbent on
faculty members to award grades

sented by “Driving Wheel.“ All

three pack a lot of emotion into

their lyrics, and Tom‘s style brings

out all they have to offer.

His album also includes a

rocking version of Fred Neil‘s
“Wild Childfa sensitive reading of
James Taylor’s “Rainy Day Man)‘
and five other lyrical gems.

‘ Sure, a lot of people can
make a career out of ﬁnding song
writers, but it still takes an artist
to tu_rn a song into a real ﬁnd.

_ Someoneglike Tom Rush.

to each individual student on the
basis of the work done by that in-
dividual in that course in accord-
ance with the evaluation options
provided in Paragraph 2.‘

(ll ) The responsibility for deal-
ing with infractions of the rules
governing grading policy by any
faculty member rests. in the first
instance. on the department to

which the faculty member belongs.

*The regulations concerning G
and I grades passed by FAS on
January 31. 1970. shall govern
these two grades.

**Since one major purpose of
the Credit-No Entry System is
to encourage students to inves-
tigate disciplines with which
they are unfamiliar, CAS Coun-
cil strongly urges departments
to allow some freedom on this
point. Students who have been
led by courses taken on the

Credit—No Entry System to wish-

to major in a given department
should not be discouraged by be-
ing led to feel that they have
made no genuine progress to-
ward mastering the discipline.

Trial Of Pittsburgh 8

 

Erupts Into Violent Spree

by RUSS TRUNZO
Contributing Writer

..(Editor’s note: This is‘ the sec-
ond part of the article which ap-
peared in‘ the- Monday March 23.
issue of The Pitt News dealing
with the fight that broke out at
a trial of eight anti-draft demon-
‘ 'straters charged with disorderly
I conduct.)

  

_After the scuffling caused by
the bailiff pulling Cappy Asch-
A‘ eim’s hair, there was a lull for
,a few minutes, during which
time one of the police asked if
"’ ‘ the magistrate wanted the court-
‘—’room cleared, and he said he
‘ ,‘did. Some of us sat down and
_ _ said that we were not going to_
“ leave, but after a few minutes
’ we got up, grumbling, and start-
ged out. It appears that what
{touched off the police riot was
that they felt we weren’t leav-
" ing ‘fast enough, because they
began pushing people. telling
.them to get out, and some of
the people objected to being
__ pushed,rsome pushed back, oth-
,ers fell, knocking over chairs,
' other people and police. '

' ' When we got out of the court-
room ‘into the ante-room some-
. one yelled that there was a girl
_-in the courtroom who had faint-
fed, and someone else yelled that
the police were pummeling a
,, young man inside the court-
/“room. The people nearest the
door tried to get back in to res-
:cue both, but were ‘met by a
[wall of police. ‘

‘For a few minutes it was a
"stand-off. We were in the ante-
.oom, the police were'in the
I’-courtroom, and‘ we traded in-
'___'sults. They told us to go home
.-and take a bath, some of us call-
._:ed them “Pigs,” "Faggots.“ and
gsome ‘even challenged them to

Oil/oice of Ghetto

by RICHARD PALAZZI

Herein suburban America,'we

ustgtake for granted the fact

hat our schoolteachers, business-

'en;' storekeepers, and other

ontacts frequently live right‘
near as in our own communities.

.They are our neighbors. This./is

not’ so in the ghetto; but it is an

iriiportant part of the cry xor

“Black Power” that is coming

om" the lips of modern Black

om'munity leaders.

Again the question of identity.

mentioned in my last article.

"comes in here. Let me. remind

you that when a Black child at-

“tends a, school taught by a

hite man, and lives in a house

-‘owned by one of these white

outsiders, hegrows up with a

{sense of being only a second-

class citizen in a world run by

i.“whitey.”

,”But the other important effect
‘of. white intervention in the

ghetto is economy — the reason

merica’s ghettos aren’t fit for a

lg to live in.

Did it ever occur to you how
such money flows from the

._pocke_ts of the common laborers

‘who live in the ghetto, out of the

hetto neighborhood and into our

iddle-class pockets? The school

H g - perty_.or make‘

eject us from the building.
Suddenly the lights went out.
the police rushed -us, we back-
ed up. the lights came on then
went off again, police climbed
over chairs. a policeman would
grab one of us and two would
try to wrest him from the cops
grasp. and three police would
come to the cops rescue. The
only light in the ante-room was
from the open elevators — which
contained policemen —— and the
light from the exit stairs. As a
group of us moved toward the
stairs a girl collapsed in front
of us. and we could see blood
coming from her mouth. Imme-
diately the police around us yell-
ed "You people did it. you peo-
ple did it," and all activity in
that corner of the room stopped.
Meanwhile, others were being
herded into the elevators and
downstairs. -

Leaving one person behind to
stay with Jamie. the girl who
had collapsed in the doorway.
the rest of us went downstairs.
where we were told that we
could not even stand on the’
same side of the street as’ the
so-called Public Safety Build-
ing. '

Reports were scanty — we
didn't know how many people
had been arrested or hospitaliz-
ed. we didn’t know who they
were and whether they were
being charged with any kind of
crime. We would later learn‘
that the person being pummeled
in the courtroom was Kenny
Boas. who was literall_v "beaten
to a pulp" by enraged mad-dog

policemen —— but at that time »
2 not even Kenny‘s wife was allow-

ediback into the building to see
what had happened to him.

We had been standing outside,

for perhaps half an hour when
one girl who had apparently just
arrived said she was going to go
into the building. She walked
across the street. into the build-
ing and got on the elevator.

take their paychecks and use
them to improve their comfor-
table homes in middle-income
areas. Even non-resident window
washers and janitors are milking
the ghetto of money that could
and, should stay within -its boun-
.daries.

And look at the grocers who

operate large ghetto supermark- ‘

ets. They employ some local re-
sidents. but all the big money’
jobs go to managers and butch-
ers and,people who carry the
poor people's shopping money
home to their own communities.
They don't even pour much mon-
ey into improving their services
in the stores.

The worst offenders of
these are the slumlords. who
know that ghetto housing is
scarce. So they collect the rent
from the poor people every
month and use none of it to
improve the buildings they own.

They- don't have to: there is
always someone who will rent
even the worst apartment at out-
rageous cost. The result_ is row
after row of crumbling; poorly-
heated buildings with broken
plumbing and rats and bugs.

Whitey isn't the only one to
blame for all this. either. It
has always been common prac-
tice for a Negro _who_owned',pro-'

all

at which point three officers.
clubs up. rushed to grab her.
Roberta Lynch ran across the
street protesting that the police
should leave the girl alone. and
Roberta was immediately grab-
bed by Friedman. the cop who
had grabbed her in the court-
room. He put her under arrest.
and we later learned that on the
elevator he made obscene re-
marks and gestures to her.

Shortly after that many of the
people waiting across the street
went home. not realizing, not
having been told. that -the mag-

istrate had ordered the police to-

let everyone back into the build-
ing and back into the courtroom.
The police downstairs never got
that order, because no_one saw
fit to deliver it to them. We
didn't find out about it until la-
ter because no one who came
out of the building‘ felt we
needed to know that we were
allowed back in. ' -

As you probably know. Kenny
Boas, Robert Ruck and Tom
Simonds were arrested during
the melee. charged with a list
of crimes including "inciting to
riot." and were held in $10.000
bail. Friday. March 20. a group
of people went to talk to Mayor
Flaherty about the incident. We
sat on the floor. the mayor and
the head of the police sat on
his desk. and several of their
cronies stood beside Tthem. lis-
tening patiently and patroniz-
ingly. After we'd told them our

story one of the mayor's- cron-_

ies informed us that an imme-
diate sign of good faith was the
fact that the bail had been re-
duced from $10000 to $4.000.

' $4.000 bail for people who were

merely victims, Ifthink that's

a fine example of the good faith-

we can expect from them. It

_leads me to believe that the

three of them might get off with
a light sentenceif they‘re found
innocent.

‘Don’t Fear, But Stay Out M The Ghetto’

ghetto to move out as soongas he
was able — to desert the people
who need him and his money.
and move to another more plea-
sant place to live. rather than
stay and improve the community
that supported him.

So, you see, Black Power advo-
cates aren’t after you, or your
wife, or your home, or your com-
munity. They want exclusive
power and. control over their own
communities so that Black-earn-
ed money will stay in the ghetto.

They want Whitey and Uncle

Tom out of their ghettos com- -

pletely. They want crooked busi-
nessmen and landlords to take
their budiness elsewhere.‘ And
they-are finally ready, after_ a
hundred years of patiently wait-

It is impossible today to pick
up a newspaper or magazine.
turn on the television. or listen
to the radio without being sub-
jected to a tirade against pollu-
tion. The air waves are fast be-
ing polluted with passionate
pleas to curtail the destruction of
our environment.

How disgusting it isfor the
clear-sighted among us to see our
nation fall prey to the agitators
and alarmists who would de-
prive us of our right to breathe
any kind of air we please. It's
time we stopped shouting and
looked objectively at the worth
of pollution.

In the first place. think of all I

the people that the battle against
pollution employs. A myriad of
writers. professors. professional
conservationists, litter collect-
ors. actors. folk singers, demo-
graphers. and public officials
owe theirlcareers to pollution.
While the campaign to keep the
earth clean wages. the wages of
the smog-watchers flourish.
When they prosper. a significant
sector of the American economy
prospers.

This can only occur if the
fight against pollution is pro-
longed. Should the conserva-
tionists win too quickly, they
will throw the economy‘ ‘into
immeasurable chaos. They will
be forced to seek employment
as firewatchers in Yellowstone
National, and, my dear readers,
there just aren’t that many fires
in that great park. The battle
must be maintained and should
only end when the economy is
strong enough to withstand the
shock. -

 

Polluted   WithPo||ution \

‘ And. of course.‘ if the fight is .4, »

actually waged. it will be your
dollars that will finance it. Those
would-be friends of humanity
would ask. nay. demand .that
you pay for your own safety.
This is not something to be tak-
en lightly. If you want to
breathe foul air. why shouldn't
you-be allowed?

The right of the minority is
one of the pillars of our society.
If might ‘is permitted to make
right, where will the abrogation
of freedom of choice stop? If
they can tell us what to breathe
today, tomorrow they may tell
us how to breathe. and the day
after, they may even tell us when
to breathe. Inhale, Exhale,
Big Breather is watching,-

Andthere are those that will
tell you that smog is hazard bus
to your health. This allegation,
and it is only that, has never
been verified. The fact that the
rate of tuberculosis skyrockets in
the presence of smog is mere
coincidence. Tuberculosis exist-
ed long before smog. TB or not
TB, the question has not been
answered conclusively.

Finally, there is the matter of
progress. Fumes from the high-
balling bus, smoke from the
?_factory, gleaming oil from the
lcrippled tanker, all are signs of
-our affluence. Our country must

ush on, and’ if a little smoke-

is the price we must pay, then
_I say it is a necessary price.

 Yet there are those who will
speak against anything. (You re-
member that bleak period in our
history when Jonas Salk conduct-
ed a smear campaign against
polio). The time has come for us
to ignore these doomsday advo-
cates and get on to the more
urgent problems that confront

Peace Symbol Vender  

MICIIAEL SIMON
Staff Writer

'The Pgh. Police showed rare.

form in their arrest of Mrs. Car-
ol Brown of_ the Opening Nite
Co.'Store. in Oakland.

Mrs. Brown was taken in for

.merely selling decals of a sup-

posed U.S. flag with a peace
symbol substituted -where the
stars -formerly were. She was
charged with desecration of the
U.S. flag. and its improper dis-

play.  ’

Several months ago. the Police
on a patriotic binge. put repli-
cas of the flag on all of their
vehicles. James Cortese. Safety
Director at that time’. gavethe
police ‘ample time to remove
theiflags. as their improper dis-
play is considered to be dese-
cration. ' '

WHY WASN’T Mrs. Brown
given a= convenient -warning
period. our Police were’? I on-
l_v ask that Mrs. Brown.'and the
Police be measured by the same

,yardstick. no matter what the
issue.
‘In the heroic. chauvanistic

efforts of the Police during Mrs.
Brown‘s arrest. they unfortunate-
ly overlooked one vital fact.
Namely. Mrs. Brown's flags
were not labeled as U.S. Flags.

How ..could she be arrested for

  
  

 desecration -..andf improper di’s- *
play; of ‘the.’  .f.lag\,:_: when «.that. 

  
 
  

h.¢'T

 

 Charged With   Desecration

If the Police would like to
press the. issue of desecration
further. they could no doubt
bring suit against the Gulf Oil

‘Co.

..GULF OIL, SEVERAL months
ago, initiated a campaign bf
which the sole purpose was to
spread replicas, exact replicas
of the U.S. Flag. '

Since practically no one ob-

, serves the rules for proper .dis$

play» of this decal of the U. S.
t'lag, (which are no. displaying
after dark- in the snow, mud.
etc). shouldn't the people that
sell this flag. andthose that dis-

play it be arrested. justas Mrs.

Brown was-

Even the Pgh. Police are
known to display such decals «in
an improper manner which
would no‘ doubt. lead to their"
arrests also. '

The tactic. or antics maybe.
of the Pgh. ‘Police have reached
a new low. There style reeks
of the Gestapo tactics that Hit-
ler used to achieve His Police
State.

..THEN AGAIN, there may be
another reason for Mrs. Brown's
arrest. The Pgh. Police may pos-
sibly have nothingbetter to do.

Imagine Pittsburgh known from
coast to coast for its crime free
streets.‘ and; very ‘bored police
force. who, can't ‘fev'en ~ uphold

t PGH Perry cum
 By Committee Charges

Editor's Note: The article appearing in the March 23 edition
of The Pitt News used as a reference by WPGH General Mana-
ger Craig Perry was issued by Student Government.

It was the fruit of a three week probe of the SG Committee
«on University Resources and Services (CURS), established to hear
and investigate complaints of students. A

CURS is an ad-hoc committee recently formed by President
elect Steve Cundra and chaired by Mike Haley. The report that
was published in the last edition of The Pitt News was a re-
lease from the Student Government Committee and did not re-
flect an official position of The Pitt News.

I The legitimacy of the committee has been questioned by a
number of students, but as of yet no counter action has been tak-
-"-.. en.

Also unknown 'at the present time is the course of action
that committee members, Cundra or Student Government as a
body can or will take. It should also be clarified that the SG Con-
stitution does not call for the establishment of such a review
committee although it is within the implied poweres of the Pre-
sident of Student Government to do so.

The responses of Craig Perry to the allegations made‘ against
him and other WPGH station members by two staffers of the radio ’
station are answered in the following open letter.)

Outgoing General Manager, WPGH

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PITT NEWS AND_ TO THOSE
PAYING THE $6 ACTIVITIES FEE /

Appearing on page 1 of Monday's The Pitt News was an ar-
ticle reporting alleged irregularities in organizational spending.
One of the areas of concern was a $250 WPGH party. As General
Manager of WPGH I feel as though an explanation to the student
-. bodyisin line. ' 4 ‘ a
First I wish to state that the annual WPGH year end party was
indeed held at the Yeshiva Achei T‘mimim. ‘which was rented at
a cost of $35 rather than the $98 reported on Mondays The Pitt
News article. ‘ ’

Furthermore, a committee headed by station's business man-
ager, Mike Star, did arrange the purchase of the gifts listed on
Monday. As is traditional. all graduating officers and past ‘offi-
' cers of the organization were given gifts in appreciation of their
service to the organization.

What was misrepresented by Mr. Freundt and Miss Nhvotny

was the origin of the funds spent for the celebration. The funds

were not those appropriated by the Student Government Alloca-
tions Committee

Instead these funds were drawn from. monies collected as
advertising incomeby the radio station. This year’s student allo-
cation has been spent in line with the budget submitted to the al-
locations committee.

— N5

.,I can confidently say that no irregularities exist in the or-
ganization’s finances. I '

The allegation made by Miss Novotny and Mr.‘ Freundt ac-
cusing me of striking mention of_ the party from minutes of a
board meeting is absolutely untrue. .

Finally, in explanation of the emergency allocation request
made to student government last November. I offer. the follow-
ing. ‘ _ .

The $1,200 request was made in order to help finance the
Black Side of WPGH, a newly begun program designed to serve
the interests of Black students on campus.

_ -These funds were not includedjin the original budget be-
cause there was‘no such program in existence when the original
 request was made.

"Put down your sword. Ev-
eryone who lives by the sword
will die by the sword."

Matthew 26:52

The big systematized institu-
tion that developed from the
simple revolutionary named Je--
sus has prostituted much through-
out the ages in its celebration of
joy. _peace. justice. and love.
Yet. a perusal of its most recent
document on The Church In The
Modern World from Vatican Coun-
cil Two shows the system still
ringing with revolutionary
sounds. It does not celebrate
war-mongering. Can every Chris-
tian come to terms with THAT‘?
Let‘s listen. ‘

"The joys and hopes. the
griefs and anxieties of the men
of this age. especially those who
are poor or in-any way afflict-
ed. these too are the joys and
hopes. the griefs and anxieties
of the followers of Christ.

Indeed. nothing genuinely hu-
‘man fails to raise an echo in
their hearts. For theirs is a com-
munity composed of men. . . . It
is always and everywhere -legiti-
mate for the Church to preach
the faith with ‘true freedom. to
teach her social doctrine and to
discharge her duty among mep
without hindrance.

The Church has a right to pass
moral judgements. even on mat-
ters touching the political order.
whenever basic personal rights
make ‘such judgements neces-
sary .
uncover. cherish. and ennoble all
that is true. good. and beautiful

' in the human community.

HOUR OF CRISIS:,;=

"In our generation when
men continue to be afflicted by
acute hardships and anxieties
arising from ongoing wars or the
threat of them. the whole hum-
an family has reached the hour
of supreme crisis in its advance
toward maturity.

Moving gradually together and
everywhere more conscious al-
ready of its oneness. this family
cannot accomplish its task of con-
structing for all men every-
where a world more genuinely
human unless each person devot—'
ed himself with renewed deter-,
mination to the reality of peace.

Consequently as it points »

out the authentic and most no-y
ble meaning of peace and con-
demns the frightfulness_ of war.
this. council fervently desires to
summon‘ Christians to cooperate
with all men in making secure
among’ themselves a peace based
on justice and love. andin sett-
ing up agencies of peace.

Citizens should develop, a gen-
erous and \loyal devotion to their
country. BUT WITHOUT ANY
NARROWING OF MIND.

In other words. they must look
_simultaneousl_v to the welfare of
the whole human family. which
ties together by the manifold
bonds. linking races. peoples.
and nations . . . For this reason
all Christians are urgently sum-
moned "to practice the truth in
love" and to join with all true
peacemakers in pleading for
- peace and bringing it about.
Motivated by this same spirit.
we cannot fail to praise those
who renounce the use of violence
in the vindication of their rights
and who resort to methods of de-
fense which are otherwise avail-
able to weaker parties too. pro-
vided this can -be done without
injury to the rights and duties of
others or of the community it-
self: .  t

Council wishes to recall first of
all the permanent binding force
of universal natural law and its
all-embracing principles.

Man's conscience itself gives
ever more emphatic voice to
these principles . . . Indeed, now
that every kind of weapon pro-
duced by modern science is used
in war. the fierce character of
warfare threatens to lead the
combatants to a savagery far
surpassing that of the past . . .
Therefore. actions which deli-
berately conflict with these same
principles. as well as orders
commanding such actions. are
criminal. Blind obedience cannot
excuse those who yield to them.

Among such _ must first be
counted those actions designed
for the methodical extermina-
tion of an entire people. nation,

or ethnic minority. These ac-
tions must vehemently be con-
demned as horrendous crimes.

The courage of those who op-
enly and fearlessly resist men
-who issue -such commands mer-
its supremecommendation . . .
All men. especially government
officials ‘and experts in these
matters. are bound to do every-

thing they canto effect these

improvements. ,
REASONS OF CONSCIENCE
Moreover. it seems "right that

laws make humane provisions.

for —the case of those who for
reasons of conscience refuse to
bear arms. - provided however,
that they accept some other form
of service _to the human com-
munity . . . Today. it most cer-
tainly demands that these lead-

~ers extend their thoughts‘ and.

their spirit beyond the confines
of their own nation, that they
put aside national selfishness
and ambition _to dominate other

nations. and that they nourish a B

profound reverence for the whole
of humanity. which is already
making its way so laboriously to-
ward unity.-

All these considerations impel
us to undertake an evaluation of
warwith an entirely new atti-
tude: '

The men of our times must

realize that they will have to-

give a somber reckoning for their
deeds of war . . . It is one thing
to undertake military action for
the just defense of the people,

and something else again to seek_
the subjugation of other nations. .

   

 

has unhappily begun. mean that
all is fair between the warring‘ -
parties . . . . " -

With these truths in mind, this
Council makes its own the con-
demnations of total war al-
ready pronounced by recent Pop-
es and issues the following de- .
claration: Any act of war aimed.‘ 
indiscriminately at the destruc— 4
tion of entire cities or of exten-
sive areas along‘ with their pop-" ‘
ulation is a crime against God?
and man himself. It merits un-
equivical and unhesitating con- I"
demnation. . —

TO OUTLAW WAR

It is our clear duty to strain‘
every muscle as we work for the " ‘
time when all war can be cqm’-r
pletely outlawed by internation-ii
al consent. In the meantime, ef _
forts which have already begu_n_f

 

and are still underway to eli
minate the danger'of war at;

of the very many leaders wh

  I Posvarl Views Strike

(Editor's Note: This is the state-
ment from Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar on the strike of hospital
workers at Presbyterian-University
Hospital.)

"I have been askedby a number
of faculty and students to clarify
the University's and my own posi-
tion regarding several specific is-
sues concerning the present strike
of hospital workers at the Presby-
terian-University Hospital.

"First. it should be understood

that although the University of_

Pittsburgh is linked to Presbyteri-
.an-University Hospital through its
medical faculty. ‘the University
does not own. control. operate or
set policy for the hospital. The
hospital has a separate and inde-
pendent Board of Trustees. some
of whose members also hold

membership on the Board of Trus-

tees of the University.

"Becauseof this separate stat-
us. existing labor contracts of the
l'niversity of Pittsburgh do not
extend to the .Presbyterian-Uni-
versity Hospital. However. mem-
bers of the University community.
and our health professions faculty
and, students in particular.’ have
a vital -interest in the well-being
of the hospital; its patients and its
employees. I,

"I believe in the principle that

workers have a- right, to bargain.
collectivelyif they wish to do so

and to select a bargaining agent

' by an appropriate. legal and dem-

ocratic procedure. ‘Furthermore.
it is,clear that hospital mainten-
ance and service employees as a

class of workers. have been.‘left,-

behind in the general improve-

ment of economic status—of‘Amer- '

ican workers during the past gen-
eration. This is partl_v because the
National Labor Relations Board.
has not assumed jurisdiction over
local charitable institutions. such
as hospitals: Without an _'ins.t'_ru-'.
mentality. hospital worker_s have
found themselves underpaid. their
interests sometimes. inadequately

‘ represented. and their own labors.

in effect. made a part of the char-
itable services provided by hos-
pitals.

“In keeping with theseviews,
as an individual trustee of Pres-
byterian-University Hospital, I
favor an election to determine
whether the hospital’s mainten-
ance and service employees wish
to have a collective bargaining
agent and who that collective bar-
gaining agent should be. I have ex-
pressed this view at meetings of
the Board of Presbyterian-Uni-
versity Hospital beginning some
weeks ago and on a number of
public occasions since. '

"I attach two important..condi-
tions to this view. One is that any
election should be carefully plan-
ned and regulated by independent
authorities so that it is truly dem-~
ocratic'and so that workers can

express their views by secret bal- _

lot without intimidation or fear
of reprisal by any of the parties
concerned. Second. whenever a
collective bargaining agent is se-
lected by such a democratic pro-
cedure. I feel that. because of the
nature of,a hospital as a public
service activity affecting human
lives. there shouldbe provision

for arbitration binding on both the -

hospital and the union -in any labor
dispute.."In other words. strikes
shouldbe prevented by this agree-
ment both before and after the
signing of any contract. P

...j*.-=13‘? '1

"I hope there would be interest
on the part of union officials and
hospital administrators and trus-
tees in pursuing an agreement
along these lines.

"In order to enhance this possi-
bility. present tensions among
hospital workers. hospital admin-
istrators and university faculty
and students should be reduced.

“As a step toward reducing ten-

sions, I would urge a liberal inter-
pretation of the current injunc-
tion limiting the locati.on and ex- ‘
tent of picketing in the vicinity of
the hospital so as to insure free- '
dom of expression on the part ‘of
hospital workers and their sym-
pathizers.

, gwfoj

“At the same time. I call upon
the supportersof the striking hos-
pital workers among our students
and faculty to regard the concept
of the injunction as a legitimate
use of court authority for ensuring _ _
that rights of all parties are pro-
tected. including the rights of
hospital patients. The welfare of-
patients must be viewed as the
first responsibility of all persons
connected with the present dis-
pute. even though there may be ,-
.disagreement with specific provi-V, '
sions of the injunction.

"If these two objectives are-
recognized. I believe it may be" 
possible to create a climate in 8-?
which the prospects of pa settle-
ment are enhanced. *

Inst1'11ctoI' Stresses Infornlality

By VIRGINIA JOYCE

Associate Editor

"We want to have a fiesta to cel-
ebrate the end of the term." an-
nounced one of the students in
Jose Cisneros' Spanish 82 class.
"It'll be at Joe’s place."

The comment typified the suc-
cess that Cisneros has achieved
in his goalof informalityin con-
ducting the new course in Latin
American culture. Set up and
organized by the native Ecuador-
ian. the innovative class. an alter-
native to the now abolished lang-
uage requirement on level four.
stresses ‘student involvement.
The slight dark Latin. a Uni-
versity undergraduate and mast-
ers' candidate in Spanish Ameri-
can literature holds very strong
ideas concerning "traditional meth-
ods of education. '

No MACHINE

"The student is not a machine
that collects data and puts it to-
gether to feed back-to the teach-
er." he insisted. “In this type of
course. everyone can have an an-
swer." 4

Monday. Jose lead on a class
session on Che Guevara. the Cub-

I an guerrilla leader. discussing the

legendary figure as a man. a
"soldier" and a politician.

But he considered it only fair
that he alert the students to his
own biases, "I'm trying to be
honest with you and myself." he
prefaced. “'1 am a Latin Ameri-
can and I won‘t dance around and
pretend. I'm subjective: you know
my bias." "

The ensuing discussion hit
upon the role of the United States
in the Cuban revolution and the
relation of Latin American revo-
lutions to American revolutionar-
ies.

RELEVANT MYTHS

‘The examination of Guevara
as a myth awakenedstudents to
corresponding mythological lead-

‘ers in their own country.: a name

repeatedly mentioned was John
Kennedy.

A   _  Parapeghhe rna'll,Va® .

Although the liberalized format
of the course lie. no final and the
single requirement of a short
paper summarizing personal feel-
ings about a chosen subject area»
appeals to most students. Spanish
82 enrollees were most attracted
by the sincerity of Cisneros.

“He believes what he‘s saying."

affered Lloyd Wislon. Senior

Psychology-Studio 'Atrs major.
"he’s tying two extremes together
and presenting it in a rational.
' fairwa'_v.."

Richard Seidel. sophomore in
Philosophy. finds Jose "extreme-
ly fair" and appreciates his aware-
ness of his own "prejudice and
the fact that he makes it known."

MORE OF IT

Seidel believes that courses
of this "type should be taught in
the elementary schools.

Cisneros‘ undergraduate years
made him acutely cognizant of
student problems and frustra-
‘tions. ‘'1 was not encouraged
an undergraduate to think
and thinking and reacting are the
keys to everything Students are
not here to come to a class and
listen to me"

J5

His students appreciate Jose
Cisneros: they appreciate his
honesty and his admission of his
own bias: they appreciate the

. reading material and his approach

to a difficult subject area: they
enjoy the specialized speakers
he brings in

'-‘You know. mused student
Arnie Steinberg. "Jose once
recommended that some of the
students transfer to another teach-
er‘s section. because his group
was overcrowded. But nobody
went."

Ceremony Honors   Tappees

By MICHAEL SIMON
Staff Writer
The honors ceremony Tap Day,
was given a new dimension Mon.-
day .-by emcee Mark Belsky, and

,, keynote speaker, Miss Konnilyn

Feig, Associate Dean of Students.
Belsky. in his address. asked

for this ceremony to be only a

beginning. only an initial attempt

at participation in the University

community and outside of it
also. He said we could not just
take from the college. but we
must stress a mutual relation-
ship with it in order to benefit.
"Tap Day." concluded Belsky.‘
"is a day of acknowledgement-and
thank-you to those making con-
tributions to the University com-
munity." '
The keynote speaker. Miss Kon-
nilyn Feig. talked much about the

value of caring. and how it is
related to students at the Univ-
ersity. She said that too many
of us do not care about the issues
that should concern us. as our
virtual existence is at stake.
"Environmental.. political.
social suicide" are the prevalent
issues upon which our fate de-
pends. and the only solution in
sight is to make people care.
Phonies. excuse. and plasticity of
the worst sort are drawing us
closer to our doom.

Miss Feig then asked» the
students to view Tap Day as
only a small beginning, not as an
end to participation. Too many
of us put our emphasis on school
activities, but there are so many
extra.-curr’icu'lar, living experien-
ces that can help us learn to care.
‘We have to learn to care about

and "

mankind, not just ourselves. “Peo-
ple must stop being blind to the

needs of man, we must care,”
concluded.Miss Feig.

The program theniturned to
the recognitiongof achievements
of the student body.

the “new offensive” of the police

modified for use as an ambulance

Eirenciiitalian Uepartment Revises Courses

by KATHY McCANN
Staff Writer
The coming school year 70-
‘71 will prove to be "quite an
experimental one" for the French
and Italian departments. accord-
ing to Dr. Barbara Sargent.
Acting Chairman. In a recent
interview. Dr. Sargent explained
that the French and Italian de-
partments have established a sys-
tem of "two different tracks to
accommodate the interests and
needs of different students".

The first track of courses.
numbered 1-4. is designed to pre-
pare majors in the spoken lang-
uage. The purpose of the new
track. courses 7-9. is to accom-
modate people who need a read-
ing knowledge of French, wheth-

er their main interest lies in
fine arts. music. History. etc.
Dr. Sargent briefly describ-

ed these new Courses. Concentra-
ting on reading recognition and
comprehension. French - and It-
alian ? willeach be a term "of
intensive grammar in prepara-
tion for reading". For those in-
terested in improving reading
skills in their own field of inter-

est. Readings in the Sciences
and Humanities will be offered
in a manner "largely like how
Ph.D. courses are set up."
French-and Italian 9. Interme-
diate Literature. will include
readings in the foreign lang-

uage with class discussions in
English. In this manner. by re-
moving "the obstacle of doing

- the
maintained Dr. Sargent. it will

discussions in French“.
also eliminate “the frustration
of the students who cant discuss
things on their own level. only

the level of their French".
Another innovation an in-

dependent study program which.

Dr. Sargent asserts. is "for peo-

is

ple who are fed up with work-

ing at the same speed asievery-
one else".

New courses are also being
projected in the upper levels.
French 50. formerly a history
course. is aimed at ‘Tan under-
standing of the'French now". in-
dicated the acting chairman. Ti-
tled Contemporary France. the

course will include readings in

French on the post-intermediate

level that explore allaspects of
French life today.

A new 80 course in literature
has been developed in both
French and Italian. All readings.
lectures. and examinations will
be in English.

Further information on all
these courses is available at the
advising center.

...llnd The Beat

Goes On

iviet A Sixth Rate Power:/.g........But Asians Disagree

/2

by ALLAN SEN IO
Contributing Writer

In this column I will state my views on our number one pro-

‘ blem, the Viet Nam war.-

- This should prove to all that I was undeserving of the Pro-
fessor Irwin Corey Incoherancy award, which was bestowed upon
‘ me April; Fool’s Day 1968.

All who read this will readily see that I do not attempt to
solve complex problems with more complex answers. in the
manner of the fuzzy-headed, lavender tailed freaks.

This only obscures thetissue all the further and makes solu- A

tions impossible. My views on the war start from the facts and
follow to logical, common sense conclusions. ‘

FIRST OF ALL, we have been engaged for five years in a
Vmajor altercation with a sixth rate Asian power. Something is
radically wrong when a country which subdued the Nazis and

i.iJ«apsy in four years takes this long to lose a war to a bunch of

farmers.

The difference is that in 1941 we determined to use every
.,,means at our disposal to defeat the enemy. Not sotoday. '

As thousands of Americans die in VietNam the U.S. govern-

ment actively promotes trade with and gives foreign aid to east-

ern European communist countries and the Soviet Union.

One of the reasons we beat Hitler is because if some politi-

 cian said “Let’s send the poor boy some wheat" he would have
; been shot for treason.

But times have changed. We are sending the Reds radar
equipment, diesel engines, machine tools (for making guns)
and many other strategic goods. If you don‘t believe‘ that just

- :.-,write your congressman and see the runaround you get.;

THIS ACTIVITY AMOUNTS to outright aid to North Viet-
Nam since the satellite countries and the USSR supply their Viet-

 namese allies with 80 per cent of their war supplies.

This and many other equally insane policies. such as cul-
tural exchanges, wheat deals. and non-prolif'eration treaties. have
been made and pursued by a group of liberal politicians who
-think it is feasible to fight the communists on one hand. and
trade and colloquize with them on the other. This has led us to

our present predicament.

In this as in any war. there is no substitute for victory. The
pointy headed intellectuals who sit in the White House and the
"Congress seem to think that there is a substitute for victory.

, In Korea they substituted a stalemate when to win would
have been easy. So the Reds. feeling we were a paper tiger
.moved the show south and started all over again. If we show
lack of backbone in VietNam they are ready to move into Laos.

'....The only definite end to this war will come when the com-

munists_ar_e so completely defeated that they will have no de-

sire to engage in aggression. But common sense talk like mine
is not appreciated by our leaders.

STOP AND THINK: Every man who took a stand for total
victory over communism has been driven from public life. Gen-
erals LeMay. Walker and MacArthur are gone.

Statesmen like Goldwater and Joe McCarthy were smeared
beyond recognition by the let'twing mass media. All the people
really against the Reds are out. and the bombastic; college edu-
‘ cated (by pinko-profs no doubt) are pulling the strings. ‘

If the peace freaks really want an end to this war thev
should be out demonstrating for military defeat t'or the com-
.munists. To demonstrate for peace without victory is treason-
Ious behavior. Concerned Americans should tell their representa-
ytives that they desire VICTORY, by any and all means. '

Top military men say the job can be done overnight or about
a month, depending. I can only wonder about the motives of the
politicians who prevent the military from achieving victory.

(UPI) LAOS — Communist
China has accused the U. S. of
sending Thai troops into Laos
to make them “cannon fod-
der.”

In a broadcast monitored in
Tokyo, Red China said that two
battalions of Thai troops were
airlifted by U. S. planes into
the Long Thien District of Laos
to “reinforce the Van Pao Ban-
dits.” The Laotian government
denied that any Thais were in
Laos fighting Communist
forces.

The deputy premier of Thai-
land said North Vietnamese
successes in Laos have
prompted guerillas in North-
ern Thailand to step up their
anti-government activities.
These Rebel Hill tribesmen
operate from Laotian bases
some eight miles from the Thai
border. -

Loyal Laotian forces report
killing seven North Vietna-
mese in defense of Long Cheng
some 80 miles from.Vientiane.
Among the dead were six wom-
en in full combat gear. Long
Cheng is the headquarters of.

"Thanks for nothing."

I didn't blame them. If you

As Asians in the United States. we have so far been inhibit-
ed from challenging the presumptions of/American officials who
claim to find support for their policies after touring Asian pal-
aces. We are demonstrating to break our inhibition and to chal-
lenge their presumptions.

WE PUBLICLY DEMAND immediate. unconditional. and
total withdrawl of U.S. troops from Vietnam. We also demand
the termination of all U.S. military presence and political inter-
vention in other Asian countries.

WE OBJECT to all foreign intervention in the domestic af-
fairs of any country. We strongly feel that U.S. interventions
against social and political revolutions in Asia and in behalf of
the corrupt ruling oligarchies of our countries are particularly
damaging to the interests of our people.

WE FEEL that the policy of “Vietnamization” is only an ef-
fort at selling a protracted war to the American public. It is
calculated to prolong America's military presence in Vietnam.
and to maintain a puppet regime there, .

In so far as the withdrawing troops are being substituted
by intensified artillery and aerial attacks on Southern Vietnam
and Laos. this new tactic will greatly increase an already un-
bearable destruction of a people and their culture. In so far as
this policy concentrates on reducing U.S. casualties while in-
creasing Vietnamese deaths. it also has intolerable racist moti-
vations. - ’

A1) HOC COMMITTEE FOR
ASIANS AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR.

On Tet, the Vietnamese New Year (February 6, 1970) a group
of Asians gathered at the White House to express their concern for

the suffering of the Vietnamese people and to demand the im-.

mediate withdrawl of US. troops from Vietnam. The above peti-
tion was drafted atthis gathering and we are now asking those
Asians who for one reason or another were unable to attend this
gathering to sign the petition to show their support.

Sometime this April. before the April 15 Moratorium, we
are planning to conduct an all—Asian teach-in, and a massive
Asian demonstration thereafter at the White House. However this
will not be possible without your support. and we cannot contin-
ue with these plans until we are assuredfof at least 2000 Asian
signatures. '

With Desecration

by JOY MANDEL
Staff Writer

On March 2. 1970 Mrs.
Carol Brown. one of the co-own-
ers of the Opening Nite Stores.
found herself under arrest on
charges of desecrating the Amer-
ican flag. In an interview. Mrs
Brown explained the details of
her arrest.
On the afternoon of the 2nd.
two Pittsburgh police officers

’ the Opening Nite with a warrant
for the arrest of the manager.
'l‘he objects of the warrant were
two peace—symbol decals. The
first had a circular design with
alternate red" and white stripes.
The face of the decal was a full
peace symbol with nine stars in
a field of blue in the left corner.
The second was rectangular in
design. also with red and white
stripes. In the left corner was
a peace symbol. Q -
The manager immediately cal-
led Mrs. Brown. the closest of the

On Friday. March 6. a hearing
was held to determine whether
or not the case would go to court.
However. the arrest warrant was
thrown out because of an illegal
technicality. In spite of this. at
5 p.m. on that day. the whole
staff of the Opening Nite Company
was brought downtown because
a new summons had been issued
stating that as of the morning of
March 6th. two decals were
still in the windows of the store.

On March 11. the three owners.
Douglas White. Jack Brown. and
.\/Irs. Brown were summoned be-
fore the magistrate for a new
hearing. It was decidedto send
the case to court as a test case.
According to Mrs. Brown. "The
law must be clarified because if
not the police could arrest many
people on this charge." She fur-
ther stated that the law was very
vague. and that if they are found
innocent the law will have to be
modified in order to include the
decals and similar items. The

 After ‘seeing Michelangelo An-
tonioni's new film‘ Zabriskie
Point, currently playing at the
Squirrel Hill Theatre. four stu-
dents at the University comment-
ed on the Italian director's artis-
try and the meaning of his latest
work. -

Zabriskie Point, billed as a mo-
vie about young people in the Unit-
ed States. focuses on the theme

of student protest as it depicts the
attitudes and behavior of Mark
and Daria. two discontented young
people who meet in the Mojave
Desert.

Following are excerpts from a
discussion in which Joe Rossi.‘

. Gary Cummins. Jason Feinman.
and Bill Gormley expressed their
reactions to the film. . ' '

‘tf

Perspective I ‘ ’

Cummins: To begin with. I don't
think that Antonioni had any busi-
ness making a film about th e
American scene. You can't really

,m~ue about American youth un-
'.less you're’a part of it. Maybe An-

tonioni saw what'was happening. -
’,« but it‘was'impossib_le for him to ..

truly feel the pulse of American
youth. ‘  - “ ’ '

_ agree‘. I think it‘s quite‘conceiva-

V of course.

Gormleyzi Theoretically. I,can't"'

ble‘ that an ob_je'ctive foreign ob-_

server might be better able to cap
ture the spirit of modern America
than anyone else. But Antonioni.
I do agree. hardly can be called
such an observer. He was not de-
tached. as he should have been.
Rather. he was immersed in a sea
of distortion and blinded by a bit-
ing wind. '

Rossi: Antonioni definitely does
come _across as being on "the
movements‘ side. But as least
that made it all the easier for him
to portray the superficiality of
"the "movement" — "unwittingly.

Craftsmanship .
Feinman Didn’t youfind An-

_ton‘ioni‘s style especially-disap—
pointing’? .

Rossi: Yes. Particularlywh_en'
you consider he’s ‘supposed to be
so far aheadof his ti\me-.V "

‘ Feinman: The" movie was un-
- sophisticatediand unpolished.

Gormley: Can we be sure‘?Mv
immediate «reaction to the incon-
sistencies in the movieand An-
_tonioni‘s failure to tie together
the knots of the plot was to consi-
der Thiminept. But is it possible’

‘ . that he was being extremely "sym-
bolic throughout? V ‘

Rossi: “I doubt it. rm really

riously. He impressed me as be-
ing as up in the clouds as people
who are a part of "the move-
ment." Now I'm sure that most
radicals will see the film and

feel afterwards that they have sat‘

through a radical experience. But
I’m a radical and I felt personally
insulted by the movie. It just did-
n‘t tell the truth. It was a cute lit-
tle fairy-tale. '
Judgment

Cummins: Alright. but h o w
about the final scene in which Da-
ria blew up mentally the rich peo-
ple‘s villa‘? I've never seen that._

. kind of explosive force in a movie
‘ before. I thought is_ was tremen-

dous. ~-
Rossi: But it has in fact been
done before.. V- V .
Cummins: Even if it has. I'm
sure that most college students
have never seen something like

’ that.

Feinman: ‘Yes. Can't you sirriplyi
forget about other films and judge
Ant“onioni_‘s7-work _ simply on its

éR'_Vosisi': Ifathere isno conntinuiity I
that I shouldstoop to ‘the lowest

levelof movie-goer and judge the
film from there. I ‘don’t accept
that. Movie-goers have taken the

‘whack. You don’t go__to a‘ movie to

that this movie was‘ the ‘ work :of-

served. something. "better I‘ from

to matchingit. _. ' ..

Acting

Gormley: Do we all agree that
the acting was egregious?

Cummins: It was, but“ that did-

n’t bother me too much. If I see

- acting in a movie that's poor. but

not offensive’, I don’t mind.

Antonioni ,p'ermit_ted Mark‘ Freeh-

that he also allowed them to "re;-_.

so ever on either the room or
the board charges. The Univer-
sity does not charge Saga rent,
and as a result, they pay us 26 per
cent per meal ticket.” Vrana
noted that in the past few years,
this kickback has been less than
the cost of maintaining the fa-
cilities that come under the
jurisdiction of the Housing Of-
fice. This includes paying off the
debt on the cafeteria equipment,
repairs of this equipment, and
salaries for maid and janitor
services.

"If we didn't get that income."
stated ‘ Vrana. “we would have
to pass it on to the students
some other way, possibly in addi-
tional room charges."

In view of Vrana's comments.
the Housing Office has three def-
inite reasons for making the pur-
chase of meal tickets manda-

  

Or

Vrana Explains Saga F immces

tory. "Number one. the only way
you can hold down the costs for
all students is to have all stu-
dents participate. If the pur-
chase of meal tickets were on a
voluntary basis. the price would
go up significantly." Vrana also
pointed out that even with fewer
people eating in the cafeteria.
almost the same number of per-
sonnel would have to be em-
ployed to maintain the service.

“Secondly. noted the Housing
Director. the University would
have to adjust room charges to
pay the debt the University is
paying off on that area."

As his final point, Vrana said
that “there have been other
schools that have experimented
with other plans and have gone
back to the mandatory method.
The students couldn't afford to
pay the higher prices.”

The Housing Directors initial
comment on Sagas contract
dealt with the price of one con-
tract for the number of facilities
maintained by Saga. "They (Sa-
ga Foods Incorporated! are in
charge of the Hunt Room. the
Faculty Club‘. the Towers Cafe-
teria. Schenley Cafeteria. and
all of the vending machines 
Because all of these areas are
under one, contract. is is far
cheaper" in the interest of the
University.

Although Vrana couldn't sup-
ply complete details of the past

, Ar..- .

seven years under Sagas con-A-_vs<,,,.

tract. he. did say that it has
been re-negotiated each year. In
what appears to be a positive
step towards better food service.
he added that "This is the first
year that we're going to get con-
crete proposals from other ven-

»/

dors. We want to take a look and '

see what else is available." Vra-
na stated that he also wanted to
have a representative of the stu-
dents participate in the consider-
ation of the proposals.

The other area of concern that
was brought into view was the
alleged change in the Housing
Office’s policy to refuse to all
non-residents of the University
dormitories admittance to the
Towers after midnight.
This action was originally con-
sidered. but was rejected as be-
ing unfair to off campus students.

I "We have had problems in the

Towers such as damage to the

' _,\,,facilities and security. I feel that

we do have a strong responsi-_

‘ V ___\ .bility to the students to provide

“ \ security.

We‘ve tried everything

in the Towers to tighten secur-.

ity. Some methods have worked.
and some haven’t. "

The procedure for the rest ‘of

the term, according to ‘Vrana,

will be putting the living areas/gag.

off limits to non-students after 
1:30 a.m. Sunday through Thurs-

day. and after 2:30 a.m. on the

weekends. The main lobby will

remain open at all times.

80th Anniversary

Concert

Glee Club "Experimertt” a Success

by CARL VAN HORN
Staff Writer

The Men's Glee Club. under the
direction of Philip Cavanaugh. re-
ceived a standing ovation from the
audience of 1.000 in attendance at
Carnegie ‘Music Hall on Friday.
The performance marked th e
club's 80th anniversary concert.

Ironically. the group chose this
year‘s concert for an experiment
which broke many long standing
traditions of the oldest student or-
ganization on campus. While the
men appeared formally in the
first half of the program and did

a number of classical works. it

was the second part of the pro-
gram which was more pleasing to
the listener as well as the mem-
bers of the Glee Club.

The first half of the program in-
cluded Psaume 121 by Milhaud
and the Glee Club did an adequate
job of handling the French work.
At times, however. thegroup was
singing eight parts and the bass
line was not audible. ’

The men also performed two
choral hymnsfrom the Rig Veda
by Gustav Holst—Hymn to Manas
and Hymn to Agni. Ericz. Fuchs
had the baritone solo throughout
and executed it well. Fuchs’ voice
had just the right quality for the

‘ . piece and he stayed on pitch‘, how-
ever, the rest of the group flatted

it a bit. I

Chanson a Boire by’P’oulenc was
perhapsthe most difficult number
on the program and‘ the men are

—‘ to be commended, for attempting

' -tions from McCord’s Menagerie j
by Irving Fine. By this time, the '

the work. Unfortunately. the solo?

ists were unable to master their
parts for theconcert. ‘

Next. the club sang Aaron Cop-_ -

land’s Song of the Guerrillas. With
Bill Gormley accompanying and‘
Fuchssoloing again, the group

conveyed the stiring message of”

Copland’s‘piece.

Glee Club performedtwo selec-

, group had finally warmed hp their

‘ voices; consequently, they did‘ an

9 .

I

,pear.ance‘ offthe _Pitt'Tunes—-ia1bar-
ber 'shop “quartet 'which'_' is com-

excellent job of executing the
rarely performed pieces. They
demonstrated a good vocal tech-
nique in the Malot selection of at- '
tacking notes and then drawing.
back to a soft tune. The Clam. a ,
piece about soup making, com-
pleted the selections from the
Menagerie and the first half of the
Glee Club program.

The first half of the program
was very difficult musically and
the men were well disciplined
throughout. However. they lacked
the breadth of tonal variety that
such a program demands. During
the final selection. the men seem-
ed .to liven up in expectation of

_ the program after intermission.

While the men werepreparing
for the second halfgof their pro- .
gram. the Pennsyngers. directed”
by Susan Dash. performed several

numbers. The all female group ,

from -the University of Pennsyl-
vania was not adequately pre-
pared for the concert, but the di-
rector has udonea good job in
bringing them to their present lev-
el ofcompetance, -in just two
months. ' V g '
Having- changed into blazers‘
and sweaters ‘from. tuxedos, the:

Glee Club presented a staged mu-1

sical review.‘ They sang from lad-T
ders, stools_'and_risers and pre-
sented a ‘varied ‘visual picture.
They opened witha rousing ver-
sion’of'Brothers Sing Ong’ , 1,
It was obviouS_'that— the group
was moreat ‘home with the con-

.\

temporary andfolk songs. Even '

though it is difficult to sing ac-'
curately while, moving around, ..
they stayed on. pitch. and finished

phrases together. .

One of the most deylightfull seg-
ments oflthe evening‘ was-the ap-

posed of four members of the Glee

. To end, the formal concert, the 4‘. Club,? The)’ 33118.3 medly‘0f_-‘ George

M. Cohen numbers in well bal-
anced harmony that’ rang‘ true
throughout the‘ha~ll._ ' " 

The Glee "Club .did ‘a tribute to
the ‘American Folk Ballad with

appropriate lighting and staging.
They ‘sang Deep River. Charlot-
town and Shenandoah. Gary Cum-
mins displayed his well trained
voice on the baritone solo, hitting
the high notes with superb artis-
try. \ '
The Varsity Quintet was next to
perform. While‘ their choreogra-
phy was not by Gower Champion.
it was indeed amusing and proved
to be a crowd pleaser. They did a
delightful rendition of De Animals.

In addition. an octet sang In-
vention in C by Bach. arranged by

with drums, guitar, bass, and pi-
ano accompaniment. The men fin-
ished off the evening by singing

the Alma Mater and by inviting

the alumni of the club to join them
for Hail to Pitt. With Gary Cum-
mings directing, it was refreshing
to hear the two songs done in‘har-
many and good taste.

_ Theigroup offered two encores
at the command of the audience
and-departed thelstage with an-
other chorus of Brothers Sing On.

‘ It seems that the Men’s Glee

_Club hit the right formula in the

second half of the program. They"

not only enjoyed it more-them-

selves, but they also were able to
execute the scores with more Amu-
sical artistry. ~

the concert, ‘‘I ~ have been attend-

g‘,g_Wesgsel_ Off To Utah;

/.;.Vies for NationalTitle
In Both Board Events

 BY JERRY MEYERS

Dave Wessel. Pitt’s outstanding varsity diver, joins swimming
Coach. Bill Grant for the long trip out to the National Swimming
Championships which begin tomorrow in Salt Lake City. Utah.

Wessel, a junior who graduated from Churchill High School in

Pittsburgh, makes his second
visit. to the Nationals. One year
ago he placed sixth in the one-
af-egmeter board event and tenth in
‘ "’ the three-meter dive. According
to Grant, "Dave looks real good.
His point total was much high-

er this year and he has a good

.chance to place high."-.

Grant was reluctant to put
much emphasis on the Eastern
Finals at-Dartmouth as a proper
indication of Wesse‘l’s diving
ability. The junior finished sixth
and tenth in the one and three-
meter boards, respectively. “The
Easterns are just a small closed-
circuit meet run by the Ivy Lea-

gue. Dave should have a better .

chanceat the Nationals with a
,more widely distrubuted set of
, divers,” Grant said.

I

H *” Wessel‘s qualifying point

total was substantiallyabove the
required total for National com,-
petition. Dave's highest score

_ on the over 420 on the one-met-'

er (qualifying total '— 350) and
398 in the three-meter (qualify-
ing total — 375). He will be com-
peting against about fifty-four
other top divers from across the

and the top six from the West
Coast Conference. I ' ‘

with -the trials in the morning

and the main events later that

day. "The divers get about a
half day off between the trials
and the competition dives." com-
mented Grant. “Dave looks ‘real
_ good and he wants to score high
this year." ‘ '

Next year. Grant is expecting’-

to take along more than his div-
er to the Nationals. “Rick Rowe
is closest to ‘qualifying in the
-500,‘l650, and 1000. Al Morris
is about one second off in the
breast stroke.” Tommy Hayes
also has a chance of qualifying,
but Grant went on to comment;

‘.‘there’s about thirty-five «guys.
doing’ Tommy’s time across the-

country and its very hard 'for a
sprinter to pick up much.” ’

Since his emergence on the
varsity diving scene. Wessel has
consistently broken and reshat-
tered his own school and pool
records in the two diving ev-
ents.

He ‘currently holds the school
and Trees Pool mark in the one-
meter dive with a point total
of 290.20. and in the three-me-
ter with a tally of 317.85. Both
these records were set in the

Injuries Plague Matmen In Nationals

Five Grapplers H11 rt g
Including Mark Pavn 

BY MIKE MILLER

Injuries are taking-their toll among the wrestlers just as the
NCAA championships are coming up. The Nationals will be held
this week—end at Northwestern University.

Mark Payne, Bud Morris. Pat Lavery. Paul Allen. and Willie Sal-

oky. are all on the injured list.

Coach Dave Adams was unable to judge as to how much he_ 

would miss his five regulars.

“It’s hard to say what will
happen,” he says, “We’re taking

"the best men available.”

The grapplers will have to
face the toughest competition in.
the nation.

"We have‘ to beat good guys
all the way through,” says Ad-
ams, "There is a-conference
champion in every class. We
can’t look for any ten point mat-
ches anywhere.”

Adams has four big gaps in his
line-up. Steve Weiss, who usual-
ly wrestles at 118 “Is just not
ready,” according to the coach.

Bud Morris, 150, has been in-
jured for the past several weeks

along with Pat Lavery. who has’

sustained a shoulder ‘and back
injury. ”
Paul Allen (177. 190 and Hea-
vy weight) is also injured.

The mat line-up will consist
of Randy Payne '(l26), Dave
Wylie (134), Bud Smeltz (142),-
Bob Kuhn (158), Craig Tritch
(177), and Jim Caramanna (190).

Tritch‘ and Caramanna are
both freshmen and both rela-

tively inexperienced, though
they have distinguished them-
selves in freshman competi-

tion. Caramanna. took first and
Tritch took second in the Navy
Plebe tourney. . ’

According to Adams the East—'

ern Conference is the only one

that does not give freshmen the
opportunity to participate in var- 5
sity competition. This puts the?»-
Pitt freshmen at a disadvantage ~
since their competition will be
more experienced. , 

Each weight class is filled by

every conference in the’natio‘n._
At 126, Payne will meet"j

Dwayne Keller from Oaklahoma
State, Lew Mason from Navy?
and Tim Chec from Michigan’;
Others distinguished wrestlers’

Medich. as a result of his col-V

one of two athletic careers. foot-

is more concerned with medicine.

“My medical career is upper-
most in my goals, and I don't want
athletics to put a cramp in it," he
stated.

Although he wasn’t selected in
the recent pro football draft, the
Pittsburgh Steelers asked him

- about the possibility of "signing as

a free agent. I
— "I wouldn't like to play pro foot-

V ball and if I did spend "time with

that, I would have to forget about
becoming a doctor." he explained.

“I’d like to try to go to Med
School and perhaps play baseball
during the spring and summer,”
he said. Yet he quickly pointed
out, “I’ll only do this if I can man-
age to play baseball without in-
terfering with my studies.”

When the baseball draft occurs
in early June. Medich‘s wavering
position (between a single or dou-
ble profession) will be stabilized.

"I doubt if I'll be picked," he
commented. “because I’ve al-
ready told scouts about my in-
tentions to enter the medical field.

Medich, during the past two
seasons, has been the most reli-
able hurler on the staff; he com-
piled a 9-3 record and achieved
the lowest ERA (earned run aver-
age) last year.

"My best pitch is the fast ball
because it”s the least strain on
my arm. but I also like to throw a
slider—change and an overhand
curve ball,” he remarked.

Medich regards his shutouts
over Tennessee and Penn State in

- his sophomore year as his most

memorable mound achievements.

However, he regards last f_all’s
21-20 conquest of the Syracuse
football squad as his greatest
thrill at Pitt. I I

Associate Sports Editor
After postponing spring drills
on the two previous dismal days.
Coach Carl DePasqua_1s deter-
mined to kick-off practice at 4:30
p.m. today at the Stadium.

Approximately 95 athletes are
expected to turn out for the initial
grid drills. Thirty-one lettermen
are returning. 13 who are starters.

Basic techniques and funda-
mentals will be stressed during
the early phase of the drills. Af-
ter‘ the workouts today and to-
morrow, DePasqua and his staff
intend to take a three-day layoff

V over Easter weekend and then re-
.’.;§«sume practice Monday afternoon.

This season, unlike last year,
the football staff will not be forced
to evaluate the entirelvarsity as
well as the freshmen. V_

However, there are a few ath-

followers) who are strange faces

Edwards will be displaying his
quickness in the defensive back-
field and the 6'5” Paluzzi will at-
tempt to handle a split end post.

vided most of the soccermen’s of-
fense, will be battling Joe Spicko,
Tim Hornish and Andy Mollura in’

dary role, he _probably will return

Defensive line, linebackers. of-
fénsive backs and receivers are

the positions that DePasqua has

shown the most confidence in.
However. he‘ll be anxious to test
his personnel in his weaker spots
—offensive line, defensive sec-
onday. and quarterpack.

J. D. Lewis, Bill Ramos, and
Craig Kugler are expected to pre-
sent the toughest competition for
the defensive backfield spots.

Also, Dan Lynn and Bob Kuziel
should be the best bets to break
into the gridders’ offensive line.’

DePasqua has mentioned that
he is hoping for, some surprises
from his freshmen. Quarterback
John‘Hogan. offensive tackle Er-
nie Webster. defensiveend Rich-
ard Oldshue. and fullback Lou Ju-
lian are considered his top pros-
pects.

The fans‘ expectations and
press releases are of little rele-
vance at the present‘, however.
since players vieing for starting
positions still must prove them-
selves in the spring and summer
drill sessions. a

 At Luncheon 22

Carl DePasqua
Opens Practice

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

The Athletic Department held a noontime luncheon in
the Student Union Supper Room Monday to kick off the spring
football drills, but the recent poor weather cancelled the ac-

tualopening of the practices that afternoon. -

Like the weather, Carl DePasqua, the Panther head grid
coach, was unwilling to ‘co-operate with the optimistic well-
wishers who look for a great season from the Panthers in the
fall. '

After the members of the local press and his coaching
staff had completed an almost one-hour delayed lunch, De-
Pasqua opened his dialogue session, without the excitement
that might have been expected.

 

“Ive always been evasive—all yearlong,’ he said. “It has-'.  
n’t been a very good year for us—you can interpret that any.- in _: 1_
way you want." " ‘

DePasqua went on to interpret the statement in his own ‘
way. Saying things like “we had to learn personnel” and “phy-
sically we’re a better looking prospect than last year at this
time.” Evidently Carl DePasqua considers -last year’s im-
proved 4-6 record to be exactly’ what it was—a losing record.

DePasqua does'n’t deny having made. progress in his first ."

season with the Panthers,_ though. In fact, his relatively suc- .
cessful recruiting program was mentioned as one of the indi- ;

cations of improvement. “The guys like to know you’re going a‘ 
to be here as long as they will be,” he reasoned, when dis- T 

cussing the fine group he is lining up for next fall’s freshma
team. - ‘

‘DePasqua,’ avoiding the overly optimistic verbia (quite
frankly, because the opening day of spring drills is too early
to be optimistic) talked about the important loss in personnel
the 1970 gridders face. _

The squad loses five offensive‘ starters and four defen-

sive regulars and, as defensive line coach Serfafino. “Foge""l",..j.“;

will not return.

Of course, -all is not bad and-everyone expects improve-  if if

ment from the Panthers in thefall. There will bell two-year] -7.
lettermen returning and 31 lettermen overall. The Panthers
will have plenty of experience in the fallline-up and already/

are publicizing three players on the “potential All—American _ "

list.”

Ralph Cindrich (linebacker), Lloyd ,_Wes/ton (defensiveifl

tackle) and Charlie Hall (defensive halfback) were on the list
which really doesn’t mean a great deal since the season is _
still six months away. But Cindrich has also been selected to -
the Football News All-America pre-season squad, indicating
respect for the Panther defense and its leader from sources’.
outside the University. .

DePasqua and his assistants aren’t doing the optimistic
talking, but they don_’t seem to mind the flattery. _
“You either get it one way or the other,” offensive coor- "
dinator Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi said. ~ - ‘

Fazio’ agreed, saying, ‘‘This way you can be happy for
two weeks! ’’
