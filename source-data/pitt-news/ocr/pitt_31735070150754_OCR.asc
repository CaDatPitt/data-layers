Suzie McConnell-Serio has a new
job, but she won’t have to travel
much farther to get to work every
day.

Pitt introduced McConnell—Se-
rio as its new women’s basketball
head coach in a press conference

, on Friday afternoon at the Peters-

en Events Center, hiring her away
from cross-city rival Duquesne on
a six-year contract.

Following back-to-back win-
less seasons in the Big East for
the women’_s team under recently
dismissed, longtime head coach
Agnus Berenato, athletic director
Steve Pederson and his adminis-
tration felt the program needed
change before moving into the

Atlantic Coast Conference.

“She has achieved tremendous
success at all levels of basketball,
both as a player and a coach,” Ped-
erson said of McConnell—Serio.
“Our program is on the cusp of a
new era with newopportunities in
the ACC. Suzie is the right person
to lead usinto the new era. We are
all committed to her success and
are very excited to begin working
together.” - .

Pederson said he consulted

men’s basketball head coach Ja-

mie Dixon when searching for a
newcoach, and Dixon told him “it’s
kind of a no—brainer, isn’t it?”

  Students share mixed reactions to
reports of secret society on campus

Brett Wilson
Staﬁ Writer

Students have recently been
made aware that members of
Pitt’s Student Government Board
and other prominent student
leaders on campus aremembers
ofthe Druids, a secret society on
Pitt’s campus. ,

But for SGB member Dave
Rosenthal, the revelation did
not hold many surprises.

“To be quite honest, a lot of us
knew that [SGB members] were
in the Druids society. The society
seems to take the most involved
students on campus, so it really
isn’t all that shocking that many
students on SGB were involved
with the Druids.”

Last week, the names of 18
Druids,’ including six SGB mem-
bers, were revealed in an article
in The Pitt News. Of the other
12 students identified, several
were involved in SGB commit-

 

tees and other campus organiza-

. tions. Most of the Druids on SGB

ran togetheron the same mega-
slate, Fifth and Forbes Proposed
changes to the Elections Code,
including a ban\on the slate
system, aim at creating a more
diverse Board. Accounts of the

“Miss Relay,” running through
Oakland hoping to collect funds
for Relay For Life at Pitt.
Relay For Life is a nationwide
event that honors cancer survi-

track for the duration of a night.
A total of 80 teams, composed
of about 900 participants, com-
peted in the relay. Team mem-

and their loved ones along with
members of campus organiza-
tions supporting the cause. At
Pitt, the student group Colleges
Against Cancer organized the
event. The relay began at 5 p.m.

on Friday and endedat 8 a.m. on '

Pitt professors collaborate to compose, perform folk music

Andrew Fishman
For The Pitt News

As Philip Smith strummed his guitar and
Stephen Weber plucked at his upright bass‘,
the duo harmonized on the chorus of an Ir-.

ving Berlin classic, “The Song Has‘Ende_d”. _

“Thesong has ended, but the melody
lingers on,” they sang together.

The melodies of that performance cer-
tainly did linger on for the roughly 25‘
people who attended. Smith, a Pitt English‘
professor, and Weber, a Pitt chemistry

professor, played a free concert at the -

Cup and Chaucer Cafe on the ground ﬂoor
of the Hillman Library on April 5. They

staged the performance through Calliope, ‘ '
a folk society that has been active in Pitts-

burgh for about four decades.

The duo combined their musical tal-
ent byplaying guitars, lap slides and an
upright bass. Weber and Smith have been
playinginusic all their lives. They played
a variety of folk and blues songs ranging
from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. '

Despite being experts in vastly dif-
ferent academic subjects, there was pro-
nounced chemistry between the _two mu-

sicians". The two professors have known

each other for more than two decades.

“We met through classes in blues guitar
we took in the 1990s at the Calliope School
of-Folk Music,” Smith said via email. “We

have performed two to three times a year -

[.for the past three years].” .
Patricia Tanner, Calliope’s executive

director, encouraged the musicians to col-

laborate, thinking the pair would comple-

* ment each other well.

play agreed. - . . - -

t “Their music was so relaxing,” fresh-
man Richard.:-.Koppenaal said.~“lt was the
perfect way to unwind after a stressful
week. And as a guitar player, their use of

V many instruments was really interesting

for me.” _
A The highlight of their performance was
a cover of Alfred Lord Tennyson’s “Cross-

“|’ve deeplyradmired their talent for

reworking old songs from _the ’20s
and 7303 to sculpt them into their
own compos,itions.’f
Patricia Tanner

“Not only are they extremely talented,
but they do a remarkable job of providing

the fascinating historical context behind '

the lyrics. They’re marvelous teachers
inside and outside the formal classroom,”
Tanner said. _

One student who saw Weber and Smith

ing the Bar.” The duo /composed an origi-
nal arrangement to perform the famous

poem as a folk song. Tennyson served as '
poet laureate of Great Britain and Ireland «

throughout the mid-19th century. A
“I have always been amazed at the
breadth of their musical knowledge, and

I’ve deeply admired their talent for re-
workingold songs from the ’20s and ’30s
to sculpt them into their own composi-
tions,” Tanner said. -

Weber said that he loves the folk,
acoustic and blues genres because they
speak “the language of Western music”
without too much complexity. _ M

Weber cited folk musicians Joan Baez
and Bob Dylan as influential musicians.

Next spring, Weber and Smith will open ‘
for musician Del Rey, whom Smith called V

“a great blues lady.” The exact date for this

performance has yet to beset.

The concert will be held at Calliope’s
newest venue, The Roots Cellar, in‘ Shady-
side. While the concert is still about a year

away, folk music lovers will have plenty —

of opportunities to see Weber perform

, A with his band, the Monongahela Sheiks, as

well as Smith with his band, Smokestack

Lightning, in the Pittsburgh area.

Though Weber and Smith might be
unlikely collaborators, they’ve united to
form a powerful duo in the folk and blues
music scene. g ’

- “Music transcends cultural boundar-

u ies,” Weber said in an email. “Within the

Western world, we all can communicate
through music.” I

American Cancer Society. Although the
group hosts many other fundraisers —
such as Save Your Balls Dodgeball, a late-
night Balls and Weiners Sale and a 3-on-3
soccer tournament -— at Pitt throughout
the year, the relay marks their biggest
fundraiser. '

Gamma Sigma Sigma, a service soror-
ity at Pitt, had the largest representa-
tion —— 60 students — at the event and
raised more than $8,000. Because of
23 on-site fundraisers, including bake
sales and raffles, an American Cancer
Society staff member predicted that the
ﬁnal amount of donations collected will
total more than the $76,000 counted on
Saturday. As of yesterday evening, CAC
had not finished counting the donations

‘ the event raised.

' While most of the donations came
from individuals who reached out to
potential donors, manyjcorporations
also supported the event. For example,
7-Eleven donated cases ‘of water and

Junior Rebecca Callodonato, a mem-
ber of CAC, said that the money raised
directly beneﬁts the American Cancer So-
ciety and will benefit cancer patients by
sponsoring research, lodging, hotlines,
education programs, advocacy initiatives
and other programs. I" -

“Some people are lucky enough to be
affected more distantly, but everyone’s
connected somehow,” she said.
' Pitt" junior Julia Noll, a social work
major, gave the opening speech for the
ceremony, telling the audience about

“Cancer touches leveryone. If-it
hasn’taffected you yet, it wi|l- in
  the future.”-

.Emi|y Nevin

CAC has about 30 to 40 active mem-
bers, some of whom have been impacted
by cancer. Callodonato, who majors in
biology, said that almost everyone in the

~ organization has served as a caregiver

. (someone that supports a loved one dur-

ing cancer treatments).
Cancer has affected the lives of two
of Callodonato’s uncles and three of her

her mother’s battle with cancer. She said

that much like a butterﬂy must struggle "

to protect itself during the winter, her
mother struggled to survive during her
fight with _cancer. « '

“Because my mom chose to fight, I

_ can have her beside me through more

adventures,” she said. .
Following her speech,_a, group of six

\

cancer survivors took the first lap along
the path behind the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. One of these ‘was ‘Marina Posvar, a
two-time breast cancer survivor and a
coordinator at UPMC’s Hillman Cancer
Center. This was Posvar’s first time par-
ticipating in Relay for Life at Pitt.

A larger group of approximately 30
caregivers for cancer sufferers took part
in the second lap. Lastly, the Pitt Band led

all participants in the first of hundreds ,

of laps. ; _ A
' At 7 p.rn., Robert'Binder of the Depart-
ment of Immunology at Pitt spoke about _
the progress-of cancer research and about
how people can help it to advance.
About two hours later, participants
gathered to take part in the Luminaria
Ceremony, in which participants place
white paper bags containing glow sticks

' in formations across the lawn. During

this ceremony, many Pitt studentsgot
the opportunity to share their own per-
sonal stories. I ,. A

DRUIDS 

‘nally designed to secretly perform acts

of kindess, has recently been focused on
promoting its members politically, ac-
cording to former members. Leaders of
the group have recently emphasized gain-
ing political power in student government
by running its members on SGB election
slates. As a result, former members have
since defe.cted from the group, citing the
group’s shift in purpose as rationale.
The Druids began in the 1920s as an
organization that promoted leadership
on campus. In the 1990_s, they withdrew
certiﬁcation through Pitt’s Student Or-
ganization Resource Center, becoming a
group with secret membership.
_ Five’Druids, including Louderback,
C.J. Bonge, Thomas Jabro, John Cordier
and Sarah Winston, ran together on the

Forbes and Fifth megaslate. Onelmember,’
Sowmya Sonapala, ran on the Steel and»

Stone megaslate.

SGB Elections Committee Chairman
Aaron Gish expressed “disappointment”
at finding out that so many members of
the Board were members of the Druids.

On March 31, Gish filed a complaint with -
- the SGB Judicial Committee that stated

that Louderback was infringing-on the
autonomy of the ElectiuonsiCommittee.
“I had known previously that the Dru-
ids had a heavy presence on the Board,
but I did not know the extent to which
the Druids had an active interest in using
their secret connections as a platform for
political endeavors,” he said. . l
'Gish,.wh'o is in the process of revisirfg
the Elections Code, had made comments
stating that the Board is not a diverse
representation of the student population
because" the majority of its members are
Druids. Louderback had asked Gish to

refrain from making such comments be— a
cause it could be seen as biased-against a

specific student group. 4 '

During a hearing on April 4, the Judi-

cial Committee determined that Louder-

back was exerting an “undue influence” _

over the Elections Committee.

Gish said that he doesn’t know whether

or not this information will have an effect
on future SGB elections. His committee
has" unanimously approved revisions to
the Elections Code that prohibit candi-
dates from running on slates —- a provi-
sion that he hopes will allow for more
diverse Boards in the future.‘ The Board
will vote on Gish’s revisions on Tuesday.

“I would not be surprised at all if it
doesn’t receive a single vote from the
Board,” Gish said. '

SGB member Mike Nites said he hoped
that Thursday’s revelation in The Pitt
News would help in changing the Elections
Code and the way the Board conducts its
elections. 

Like Rosenthal, Nites is not a Druid. In
addition to serving on SGB this year, Nites
was the Allocations Committee chairman
for last year’s Board.

"‘We heard it all before, back around
election time,” he said. “Even last year
on SGB, we heard about people in SGB
being Druids.”

V Although both Rosenthal and.Nites
said they were glad that the Druids’ pres-
ence on SGB was revealed, Nites said he
did not think that reporting on the Druids
would have much of a lasting effect...

“Theaverage student will not care that
much about it. Regardless, it was a story
that needed to be written and will draw at-
tention to the current Elections Code and
the way SGB elections are run,” he said.

Students not directly involved with
SGB had different reactions to the reports.

Freshman neuroscience major Teressa
Opalka said she found it “shocking” that
many of those involved with SGB are also
Druids. '

“It does leave you with feelings of dis-
comfort and uneasiness,” she said.

Like Opalka, sophomore Kim Lor said
she found the accounts shocking,_but was
doubtful-about the existence of the Druids
on campus, referring to the reports a
“conspiracy theories.” ~ "

“To me it just seemed unreal, because
it’s weird to think that a group would try
to just take over SGB,” Lor said.

Sophomore microbiology major Owen
Maley also wasn’t convinced.

“I’m» a skeptic of the organization and
of the articles,” he said. “I don’t. believe
it’s all exactly real.” I T

A departing senior imparts Words of
Wisdom, reflects on Pitt experience

Tracey Hickey
 Columnisf

I wrote the ﬁrst_Going Mental col-
umn in the fall of my junior year."
It was spread over four separate
issues, focused on how to seek"
help if 'you’re struggling with
mental illness,‘ and-was met with
a small, outpouring of heartfelt
—.and sometimes heartbreak-
ing — emails from Pitt students.
who felt_ like there was no relief
available for their pain. I
My next column was about

why Pennsylvania’s new abortion

regulations were a misguided and Z

disingenuous response to the nor-
rors of Dr. Kermit Gosnell’s unli-
censed slaughterhouse “clinic” in
Philadelphia, and it was met with
an angry letter from Pitt Students
for Life. A ' .

Over the course of my column,
those have been the two hats I’ve
worn primarily — the self-help
hat for my columns about living
with mental illness and the ac-

tivist hat for my columns about

' politics and social issues. —

I’ve _ often ‘ worried that my
politics would alienate’ people
who could beneﬁt from my ad-
vice about mental health, or that
disclosing my _own struggles with
mental illness would discredit
my other opinions -—— why hear
out‘a' writer who disagrees with
you when you already know she’s

-crazy? But overall, I’ve enjoyed

wearing both hats, and more
than anything, I’ve enjoyed the
fe'edback from! other students,
whether my column inspired them
to go into therapy or whether they
thought I was abrainwashed, left-
wing bimbo. ‘

A lot of changes are on the ho- if

rizon for me after graduation. I’m
moving to Gainesville, Fl., with

my boyfriend, desperately seek»-

ing a job and getting ready for the
ﬁrst year of my life that won’t be
spent in Pennsylvania. I’m look-
ing for ways to stay on _top of my

writing, and considering continu-'

ing this column on my WordPress
blog, especially if I could ﬁnd a
way_ to monetize it.‘ It isn’t easy.
In the age of the Internet, it’s a
struggle for writers to get paid
because millions of people are
willing to write for free.

In lieu of a well-thought—out
reﬂection on my time at Pitt, I’ve
decided to share, as my farewell,
some unrelated pieces of wisdom
that I accumulated during my four
years here. If you didn’t beneﬁt
from any of the_ advice in my col-
umns, I hope you will beneﬁt from
these.

4 Sometimes the cruelest thing
you can say to someone is ‘‘There’s

a nothing wrong with you.” When

you’re struggling withjsymptoms

‘ ~—— mental or physical —— that

make you miserable and impair
your daily living, those words
sound like, “There’s no relief for
this. It’s always going to be this

person, you’d just be able to deal with
it.” That is a cruel lie. If you are suffering
more than you are enjoying your life, then
something is wrong —— whether or not it’s
diagnosable —- and you don’t have to live
like that. '

Don’t trust anyone who goes out of their
way to tell you that “no one cares” about an
issue or controversy or piece of news. If no
one cared, why would those people be try-
ing so hard to shut the conversation down?

The person who tells you that “no one
cares,” especially if they seem unusually ve-
hement or even angry about it, is someone

April W5, 2013 1 The Pill News 1 \A/vvx/v.p1t‘mews.oom

that people do care. If you’re an SGB mem-
ber — Druid or not — involved with the
megaslates and rule-infraction cover—ups, it
might be very important to you to convince
people that “no one cares” whether SGB
elections are being conducted honestly.
If you’re very invested in the idea that “no

one cares” whether there’s horse meat in,

the beef in England, maybe you should re-
evaluate why it would pain you so much to
admit that other people don’t share your
apathy about food safety or peoples’ right
to know what they’re feeding their families.

Be kind to yourself. Treating your body
well is part of this, but don’t prioritize it to
the point where having a forgiving attitude
toward yourself falls by the wayside. Hav-

you eat something made with high—fructose
corn syrup is worse for you than just eat-
ing it. Exercise won’t improve your mood
if you use it as a way to punish yourself.
With all the millions of ways to move your
body, there is absolutely no reason to go
running if you hate" it.

Men: if a Woman you approach at a bar
or a party is unsubtly backing away from

you, it means she is not going to touch your -

genitals tonight. Cut your losses. Don’t keep
pursuing her after she tells you she has a

Maybe -she is. So what? Making up a boy~

sign that a woman is not going to _touch

forgiveness after an insincere apology; an

Stellar pitching paves way forseriesmsweep over Notre Dame

Rhysmdenhoven improves! his record to 6-0 on Sunday.-Sool Lee | Staff Photographer _

Nate‘Barries -'
Senior Staff Writer ’

One week removed from a series sweep at a

the hands of the‘ South Florida Bulls, the
Pitt baseball team rebounded in magniﬁcent

fashion by sweeping the No. 16 Notre Dame V

Fighting Irish‘ at Cost Field this weekend.

Pitt (24-9, 6-3 Big East) used a weekend of '

solid starting pitching along with consistent
offense to defeat. N otre Dame (19-14, 4-8 Big
East), as the Panthers never trailed the op-

position over the course of the three games. ‘

Junior Ethan Mildren started the weekend
with a complete game shutout on Friday,

propellingyitt to a 4-0 victory.

Fellow junior-Matt Wotherspoon followed
suit, pitching eight innings on Saturday and
picking up the 4-2 win.

Rhys Aldenhoven received all the run sup-
port he needed while pitching seven shutout
innings in a 12-3 rout of the Irish to cap off the
weekend. Right ﬁelder Casey Roche paced
the offense, going 2-for-5 on the day with a
two-run home run in the eighth.

“ “It’s huge,” Roche said about the sweep.
.“I .don’t think anybody really thought we.
were going to sweep Notre Dame —— they’re a
pretty good team. But it’s good to see us come
back after three tough games against USF.”

Pitt 4,_Notre Dame 0 _ ’

Friday’s story revolved around Mildren’s
pitching. For the third—straight start, the ju-
nior pitched a complete game.. N otre Dame
threatened in the ﬁrst inning when Frank
DeSico led off with a single, but he was caught
stealing by Pitt catcher Elvin Soto. . _

Third baseman Ericjagielo later doubled
to right-center ﬁeld and advanced to third
when ﬁrst baseman Trey Mancini reached
on an error. Mildren worked out of the jam,
getting left ﬁelder Ryan Bull to ﬂy out and

* then cruisethrough the ﬁnal eight innings.

‘ Notre Dame managed just one more hit '

during the rest of the game, as Mildren (6-2)
ended his day. allowing just three hits, two
walks and no runs, plus three strikeouts.

“I think the storyline today was deﬁnitely
Ethan Mildren. He pitched outstanding,”
head coachjoejordano said. “He was in total
command and I thought that we played some
solid defense behind him, as well.”

I At the plate, Pitt’s hitters prevented Notre
Dame’ starter Pat Connaughton (0-2) from

even qualifying for a decision. Connaughton ,‘_

only lasted 4 2/3 innings and allowed three
runs on six hits and four walks.

Center ﬁelder Stephen Vranka continued
his hot hitting to open up Friday’s scoring as
he tripled with two outs in the second inning
to score third baseman Sam Parente, who
singled to lead off the inning.

Pitt forced Notre Dame n;anager'Mik
Aoki to pull Connaughton in the ﬁfth after
a sacriﬁce ﬂy from Soto scored Roche from
third. Later, Parente dealt the ﬁnishing blow
to Connaughton’s day with an RBI triple of
his own following a Steven Shelinsky single. .4

Soto gave Pitt an extra insurance run
in the seventh inning with a solo shot to
right ﬁeld — his fourth round—tripper of
the season.

Pitt 4, Notre Dame 2

Replicating Mildren’s Friday performance
was unlikely, but Wotherspoon (5-1) deliv-
ered a solid outing on Saturday afternoon.
Wotherspoon left the mound after eight in-
nings and 117 pitches, giving up ‘two runs
on four hits and three walks while striking
out ﬁve batters. ' V

More impressive about ‘Wotherspoon’s—a-9:
performance was his ability to out-duel Notre
Dame starter Adam Norton, who entered

The Pitt football team didn’t keep score
during its spring game. But if it did, Chad

, Voytik’s team probably would have won.

Despite thecold and windy weather, the
diminutive quarterback from Cleveland,
Tenn., who entersnext season as a redshirt

, freshman, shined in the Pitt Blue-Gold Game

at Bethel Park High School on Friday night,
completing 27 of 33 pass attempts for 358
yards and three touchdowns.

Although head coach Paul Chryst is ex-
pected to select veteran transfer Tom Savage
next season as Tino Sunseri’s replacement
under center, the inexperienced Voytik
certainly impressed the 3,642 fans in at-
tendance Friday. And more importantly, he

pleased his coaches. '

Voytik impresses in 

After the game, Voytik said that he isn’t
ready to give up the battle for the starting

, quarterback job just yet.

“I’ve never really thought [the quarter-
back competition] was over,” Voytik said.
“I’m just doing everything I can. It’s been a
fun spring. We’ve all improved?‘ ‘

The redshirt freshman connected with

~ early enrollee tight end Scott Orndoff for

two touchdowns early in the game. He later
showed off his arm strength on his third
scoring pass, ﬁnding redshirt junior Kevin
Weatherspoon deep down the ﬁeld for a
66_-yard touchdown.

Weatherspoon, who finished with a
game-high 11 catches for 175 yards, also
stood out, as the Panthers look to replace
graduating wide receiver Mike Shanahan’s
production. 5 . V '

“I thought we got some good work  _
Street said. “I felt like we came out today ,

and showed .-the fans that we’re putting-it
together on offense.” '

‘ All three of Voytik’s touchdowns came
against the Pitt second-team defense. The
starting unit played well, aside from allow-

‘ ing a4'8‘-yardtouchdown run by sophomore
Isaac Bennett midway through the game.

_ Defensive tackle Tyrone Ezell felt good
about the defense’s performance, and the
redshirt senior said he feels comfortable
as a leader in the locker room.» '

“I feel like I got a lotof respect on the
team from my teammates. I’m not too much
of a vocal—type leader,‘ I prefer to lead by

‘ example,” he said. “But I’m embracing be-

Mcconnell-Serio takes over at Pitt after six years at ﬂuquesne. Bobby Mizia | Assistant
Visual Editor . . ' ‘

. McConne1l—Serio graduated from Seton-
La Salle Catholic High School in Mt. Lebanon
before attending Penn State, where she be-
came one of the nation’s best point guards

while playing from 1984 to 1988. She then.

won agold medal with the United States
women’s basketball Olympic team in Seoul,
South Korea, after graduating from Penn
State. - . "

' Despite her State College connections,
McConne1l—Serio said Pittsburgh was the
only place she wanted to be. _

“I grew up a Pitt fan. I am a Pittsburgh
girl. I wouldn’t have left Duquesne for any
other job,” she said. . ~ _

Following ‘six successful seasons at
Duquesne, including a 24-8 record in her
ﬁnal season, McConnell-Serio faces the tall
task of turning around the Panthers program.

Regardless of the current standing of

the Pitt team, McConnell-Serio is a proven.

winner. I -

After her stellar playing career, McCon-
nell~Serio returned home to coach Oakland
Catholic High School-to three Class AAAA
state championships in 13 seasons.

While" coaching at Oakland Catholic,
McConnell-Serio also played three seasons
in the WNBA and was named to the all-WNBA
First Team in her ﬁrst season with the Cleveé
land Rockers.

Three years after she played her ﬁnal

WNBA game, McConne1l—Serio returned to
the professional scene as a coach, leading
the Minnesota Lynx to the playoffs. In just
her second season, she was named WNBA
Coach of the Year after guiding her team to
a franchise—record 18—win season.

Pitt junior guard Brianna Kiesel said she
is looking forward to learning from the deco-
rated point guard, especially in the up—ternpo

I style McConnell-Serio prefers.

' “Just for her to come in here being a gold
medalist, being a winner —— I really don’t
know what a winning season is like yet,”

Kiesel said. “I am excited, I know I have a,

lot to learn from her.”

During her six seasons at Duquesne,
McConnell-Serio guided the Dukes to ﬁve
consecutive 20—win seasons, and she now_
hopes to have similar success in rebuilding
the Panthers. y

“We will work as hard as we can to bring
the pride back to Pitt women’s basketballjf
she said. ,

McConnell-Serio and Pedersonreached
an agreement Thursday night. She signed
the contract in Pederson’s car outside Consol
Energy Center, and now the_ former Oakland
Catholic, Minnesota Lynx and Duquesne
head coach hopes she has found her des-
tination job. ' .

“This is my last job,” McConnell-Serio
said. I

the series victory for Pitt against Notre Dame.

“To win the series today puts us in a great
shape entering tomorrow, but as always we’re
going to take it one day at a time,” Jordano
said.

Pitt 12, Notre Dame 3

Sunday’s sweep—c1inching victory came
in a fashion Pitt fans are more accustomed
to seeing from the explosive Panthers this
season. Pitt’s 12 runs came on just 10 hits, and
the Panthers saw almost half oftheir offense
cpme on just two swings of the bat by Roche“
and sophomore ﬁrst baseman Eric Hess.

Hess gave Pitt its ﬁrst runs with his three-
run home run in the ﬁfth inning, and Roche
ended the Panthers’ scoring with a two—run
blast in the eighth.

On the mound, Aldenhoven (6—o) kept his
record perfect with seven innings of shutout
baseball, allowing ﬁve hits and ﬁve walks
while lowering his ERA to 2.52.

This weekend’s performance moves Pitt
into ﬁfth place in the Big East standings and
gives the Panthers a four—game winning
streak that senior shortstop Evan Oswald“
believes will boost the team’s conﬁdence
as they push through the second half of the
season. ' . ‘

A ‘‘we’re coming off two walk—off‘losses
at USF, and those were devastating for us
because we felt we deserved to win those
games and they just didn’t turn out in our
favor,” Oswald said. “Coming up here, refo-
cusing and taking out Notre Dame is a huge
conﬁdence boost for us and gets us back to
where we need to be.” I -
