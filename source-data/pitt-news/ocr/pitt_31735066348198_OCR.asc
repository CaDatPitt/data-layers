Pitt Heads Fear Coal Strike

BY PETE BUTCH

An extended strike by the United
Mine Workers (UMW) could bring
about a serious curtailment of Pitt’s,
heat and power, causing a possible
shut down of buildings or parts of
buildings, according to Hunt
Martin, director of Pitt’s physical
plant.

The UMW has threatened a
walkout November 12 when the
current contract expires over issues
of wages, cost of living escalator,
company contributions to the
union’s welfare and retirement
fund and sick pay. Unlike many
other industries, miners do not
receive sick pay.

Furick Solicits Opinions

For Pitt News Betterment

BY BILL MOORE
Student Government Board (SGB)
president Mike Furick solicited
suggestions for betterment of the

Pitt News at the board’s Wednes-I

day meeting.

Furick plans to take the SGB’s
recommendations to a November 6
meeting of the Pitt News study
commission formed last month at
the suggestion of Pitt News Editor-
in-chief Scott MacLeod.

“I’m upset about internal opera-
tional procedures at the Pitt
News,”,said SGB member Bruce
Keeler.’ “One person has ﬁnal say
over the editorial content of the
paper.

“I think it is important to deter-
mine how the Pitt News stands in
relation to Student Government,

Union Hearings

Cancelled Today;

Resuming Monday

Faculty unionization hearings,
which were scheduled to resume
downtown today after nearly a
month’s recess, have been can-
celledby Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board Hearing Examiner
Sidney Lawrence.

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar’s
academic advisor David Powers
was expected to return to the
witness stand and face questioning
by the counsels for several faculty
organizations who are bidding to
represent Pitt’s professors.

William Hannon, Pitt’s director of
Employee relations, said yesterday
that Powers is expected to be
heavily involved with the contro-
versy over the chairmanship of the
black studies department tomor-
row, and probably would not be
able to-testify. But he said the
lawyers had agreed to cancel the
hearing and resume Monday.

and how we should go about
funding the paper in the future,”
said Furick.

SGB member Paul Hertneky criti-
cized Pitt News editorials. “One
fault with the paper is that it should
have a closer correlation between
the Editorial department and the
News department. There are a lot

of times when‘ the editorials don’t i

reflect what is going on in‘ the
news,” alleged Hertneky.

Keeler objected to the number of
pages allottedto sports coverage.
“It always seems the Sports de-
partment has four or five pages in
each issue while most of the
articles are AP (Associated Press)

’ coverage.”

“I’m tired of only seeing Tony
Dorsett’s picture on the sports
pages, there are other ‘ football
players,” added Hertneky.

Hertneky suggested the Pitt News
study other college publications
“to see how they are funded and
how they are run.”

Furick said the Pitt ‘News should
be working towards future ﬁnancial
independence. “This is of prime
importance,” he said.

“I think we should be aware of the
fact that it is not the place of the
SGB to tell the Pitt News what to
do,” closed Keeler.

The board also discussed the
possibility of attending a meeting
of student government leaders
from numerous Pennsylvania col-
leges to be held at Penn State. The
summit meeting is planned to
discuss the possible formation of a
student lobby in Harrisburg‘.

College Young Democrats presi-
dent Betty Nelson told the board
the November 9 meeting would
concern “beginning a Harrisburg
student lobby to lobby for bills
speciﬁcally concerning education.”

“The lobby would work towards
legislation to .have the state pick up
any rise in tuition at a state college,
instead of passing it on to the
student. Formation of this lobby

Hayes Raps

Ford's Plan

For 70,000 Veteran Jobs

B.Y LISA RUBENSTEIN

Office of Veterans Affairs Director
Jack Hayes blasted Ford’s recent
proposal for the federal hiring of
70,000 Vietnam Veterans by July 1,
1974, saying the action will be
insufﬁcient to aid the majority of
veterans.

Hayes explained if the Ford plan
worked it would provide 70,000
jobs for veterans,7but it would not
aid the vets who did not receive one
of the 70,000 jobs.

He also doubted federal capacity
to provide the jobs. '

“The success of the job program
will depend on the reactions of
federal agencies,” he said. “At a
time when agencies are being
asked to cut back their budgets and
unemployment is on the rise for
everyone, veterans and non-vet-
erans alike, my question is, where
are the jobs coming from?”

Hayes questioned the quality and
character of the jobs the veterans
will receive under the program. ‘I
wonder if they are going to be
given the type of jobs I think they
deserve. If they are just ﬁller jobs

Davis Challenges Moorhead

BY KEN GORMLEY

In what has been described as a
race between the Democratic and
Republican philosophies,. incum-
bent Congressman William S.
Moorhead is challenged for his
14th district seat in the US House
of Representatives by Republican
Zachary Taylor, Davis.

“The -difference is obvious,”
Davis said. “Mr. Moorhead’s
philosophy is, if a problem exists,
appropriate money and form a
committee to spend it, even though
nothing gets accomplished. But I
say most problems can be solved by
capitalism and the free market
system. I believe- in leaving to

people what they can do for‘

themselves. ’ ’

Although Moorhead found his.

opponent “an agreeable fellow,”
he did not entirely agree with this
evaluation, ‘declaring he was only a
big spender in areas where a
Congressman has a duty to be a big
spender.‘ “It's true: I would
probably put a great deal more
emphasis on spendings for social
expenditures than Mr. Davis. But

other than that I’ve tried to reduce’

the budget, particularly for pro-
grams where real wastes occur,

such as defense.”

In an effort to’ make their
similarities and differences clearer
to the voter, the two candidates
attempted to deﬁne their positions
on various issues, in separate
interviews with the Pitt News.

INFLATION
Besides supporting the more

obvious means of sparking ;the-
economy by cutting the federa
budget, Moorhead noted food. 
fuel together constitute thellarges
component of inﬂation. He the
fore favored “methods to reduce...’
consumption, particularly of

‘ favis pointed out “The govern-
“ent can’t be relied upon entirely
Jogend inﬂation. We can’t wave a
wand and create more oil and
decrease prices. But it is Con-
gress’ .' responsibility to do the
one thing economists agree upon...
deduce .unnecessary government
pending.” However, he felt his
pponent has not done this.
‘Congressman Moorhead has
ailed miserably to cut government
pending, except in defense. If I
I ere in Congress I would cut every
budget...a million here, a million
here.
I THEPROPOSED HOME

I RULE CHARTER

A Moorhead admitted he did not
‘:‘pretend to be an expert” on the
subject, but the Congressman did
hope the referendum would be
passed ‘next Tuesday, since “it’s
ridiculous for Pittsburgh to have to
;ely on the State Legislature for
things that should be handled at a
ocal level.” He added that the
planned neighborhood advisory
councils were “great.”

Davis said he has endorsed both
the Pittsburgh and‘ Wilkinsburg

 

ge PITT NEWS-—'Friday, November 1,1974
Zlth Congressional District

ovis Challenges Moorhead

Home Rule charters. “I come from
Colorado where Home Rule has
been a fact of life for 70 years.”
Although the Congressional hope-
ful was not completely satisﬁed
with the charter as it stands, he felt
it was an acceptable first step
towards ‘a workable Home Rule.
ISSUES OF
RADICAL DIFFERENCE

Moorhead pointed to one clear
difference in opinion which was
brought up in several of the
debates he had with his opponent.
Unlike Davis, he said, “We have to
support, on a federal level,
expenditures for the arts and
humanities.” Moorhead agreed
the Congress must limit its
spendings, but believed it was
nit-picking to cut out small,
essential funds rather than “the
major sources of waste.”

In general, Moorhead felt the
major difference between him and
his opponent was easily defined. “I
like to think that I am a
representative of the Democratic
Philosophy, while Mr. Davis fairly
well represents the Republican
Philosophy.”

On the latter point, Davis seemed
to be in agreement. “We disagree
on the basic approach to govem-
ment.” In comparing American
political activity to a football game,
he was of the opinion that
“Government should be a referee
and only call fouls,” hut believed
Moorhead was more _i_nclined

towards a government which
“called the plays.”

Getting more specific, Davis cited
de-segregation as an issue on
which he and the Congressman
held entirely different views. He
stated that Moorhead has generally
favored bussing to achieve racial
balance, while he found the
practice “racist, stupid, and
wasteful. It is demeaning to tell a
black he has to go to school with
whites if he wants to learn
anything. And it also teaches .a
white kid he’s-superior. It’s Nazi
Germany all over again.”

William S. Moorhead has been a
,member of Congress since 1958,
and is Assistant Democratic Whip
for the House of Representatives.
Recently, he has worked on
legislation for consumer protection,
additional funds for effective mass
transit systems, and played an
important role in the passage of the
Housing and Community Develop-
ment Act which will provide
Allegheny County and the City of
Pittsburgh with $25 million in ﬁrst
year funding for housing activities.

Zachary_ Taylor Davis presently
operates a sales consulting busi-
ness in Pittsburgh. An active
political scientist for most of his
life, Davis served as a college
student on the staff of the late US
Senator Eugene Millikin, and was a
1958-1968 Delegate to the Colorado
Republican Convention.

lobby,” Nelson said.

SGB members Bruce Keeler, Paul
Hertneky and Ruth Weinbrom
tentatively agreed to attend the
Penn State meeting.

The board discussed the Under-
graduate Academic Review and
how it should be improved in the
future. Furick termed the recent
UAR a “fine, ﬁne publication” and
promised it would improve stead-
ily. “Next time the UAR will be
bigger“ simply because interest has
been generated now that teachers
see that it is. being published
again," he said.

Furick clariﬁed the role SGB plays
in publishing the UAR. “We pay
for the printing of the resultsithat

the Center for the Improvement of .

Teaching gives us, out of the
goodness of their heart. They pay
to have the individual classed
surveyed and the results tabulated.
Furick said. ~

Young Socialist Alliance  ‘

requested‘the SGB’s assistance in
his attempt to organize a forum on
the faculty unionization controver-
sy. “The YSA along with other
campus organizations has taken the
initiative in feeling out prospects
for a public forum with both sides

represented. This would be mainly
for the benefit of the students,”
Satinoff said.

Satinoff asked the board to co-
sponsor the forum and assist in
getting administration representa-
tives to participate in the planned
forum.

Emergency allocations to the Pitt
Commuter Association ($650), the
Glee Club ($85), and the Greek
Week/ Engineering ' Cabinet
concert ($1,000) were all approved
by the board.

Furick said he would meet with
Black Action Society chairperson
Graylyn Swilley to discuss the
recent Black Studies controversy
and commended the Chancellor’s
office for its action during last
week’s BAS demonstration. “They
(the assistant chancellors) could
have called in the police and the
whole thing coiild have turned into
something like‘Ke*tit‘State, but they
didn’t,” Furick said.

which will not supply enough steam
to heat the University.”

The manager of the Bellefield
steam plant, Louis Susany, felt the

strike would have little effect on the:

plant. “We have 50 carloads of coal
stored which would last six weeks if
a strike occurred. But even if we
run out of coal we can burn gas and
oil to supply steam. But this would

not supply enough. We would I

probably ask people to curtail their
heating to conserve steam. This
would be by asking them to lower
their thermostats to 68 degrees as
we did with last year’s energy
shortage. This resulted in a
considerable savings of coal even
though the plant faced no real
shortage.

“Steam will be the ﬁrst source

«we’ll have trouble with,” rMartin
‘ said. “Should the steam supply fall

shortwe will be faced with two
alternatives. We could reduce the
amount of heat to all buildings.
“But depending on how the strike
goes we could keep reducing the
heat until all
uninhabitable. Or we could close
some buildings or parts of
buildings at the onset of the
cutback so we could maintain the

other buildings at a habitable.

temperature. .

But that decision over which
buildings will close will be made
later. We have done enough

research that the choice could be -

made in a day,” he said.

“If Duquesne Light would start
running low on coal. there would
probably be appeals issued to cut

However, not everyone supports the home rule charter. Those who
eallfor its defeat maintain the charter should have made provisions for -

according to the charter City Council can institute provisions calling for

{We are convinced, though, the beneﬁts of this charter outweigh the
iabilities. The time and energy it would take to reestablish a charter
commission and rewrite a charter to be approved by voters would be so
overwhelming that Pittsburgh would more than likely lose the
op'portunity to have home rule. We; however, encourage the City
 to vote for the election of the legislative branch by district once

Tljespite this shortcoming, we recommend to Pitt students and the

Flaherty:

BY BET NELSON

The people of Pittsburgh have
found a governmental figure whom
they can still believe without
having their faith shattered time
and time again. Pete Flaherty, the
"so-called “Maverick Mayor,” has
proven to the people of Pittsburgh
he understands and shares their
concern with economic issues. He
has tried to control inﬂationary
trends in Pittsburgh's government
while still maintaining adequate

service to his constituents.
The reason for Pete’s success in
Pittsburgh is not a “family secret.”
In essence, it is the basic thrust of
his governmental outlook, fiscal

responsibility. Pete has long been

the advocate of tax decreases,
reduced crime rates and fiscal

conservatism. He‘ has carefully
nurtured "the image of the
governmental official who has

slashed his payroll, eliminated
unnecessary budget items and
abolished the wage tax with the
approval of City Council.
Austerity and frugality have long
been the traits of his executive
abilities. There is no reason to
presume that Mayor Flaherty will
look at governmental expenditures
differently in Washington DC. He
has succeeded in improving the
efﬁciency of government while still

. cutting the cost of government. He

has dogmatically maintained the
image of a politician who opposes
spending, and he preaches tax
decreases with results.

The citizens of Pennsylvania are
- being hit hard by growing inﬂation,

the accelerated cost of government,
and the lack of constructive reform
Pete
Flaherty , has proposed many

' since over.

Maverick Senator

substantial programs to combat the
increases in the inﬂationary spiral
which has captured the heart of the
American economy. He believes
the federal government musttake
the first steps to make ‘ends meet.
The first order of business on
Pete’s agenda is to balance the
budget by cutting federal spend-
ing.

For the past five years, the US has
seen nothing but deficit spending,
in spite of the fact the war is long
The budget, in -line
with President Ford’s belief that no
area is sacred, should be cut across
the board. Pete believes the
Defense Department budget alone
can be cut by 15% A without
jeopardizing national security.

Flaherty has recommended that
income from Social Security be
excluded from “eligible income”
under the Federal Food Stamp
program. “High food costs are
hitting those of our aged population
who are least able to pay,” the
Mayor contends. Unfortunately,
many elderly citizens are just above
the income level allowed for the
purchase of food stamps. This
would indeed be a welcome step to
ease the ﬁnancial burdens of the
elderly.

As the saying goes, charity begins
at home. One can transpose the
saying _to read, tax cuts and
reduced spending begin at the
federal level of government. It
would be a substantial beginning
on the .road to economic recovery.

Pete is in favor of increasing the
personal exemption on the income
tax from $750 to $1000 apiece for
husbands and wives, $1000 for
single persons and $850 for
dependents. Mayor Flaherty
explains ‘‘This cut in federal

Search Committee

of its contents at the meeting in
which it was read to the Dean.

Iraised no objections to the report
at that time, largely out of a
concern not to wash dirty linen in
front of the Dean and because the
report sounded fairly accurate. A
week or so later, when committee
members finally received the
written report, it was clear that it
contained certain misrepresenta-
tions. Subsequently, certain of
those misrepresentations have
been used to confuse and mislead
the public. For this reason they
merit some attention.

The report gives the impression
that there was a consensus around
the name of Curtiss Porter. There
was no consensus around any one
name; there was a consensus
around three names, as the
chairman himself forcefully, even
physically, argued just after the
vote was taken. Second, the report
states that the “senior” faculty
members of the committee felt all
the names submitted were capable
of receiving tenure. This is highly
doubtful; if true, it must have been
communicated to the chairman in
private.

The committee agreed it was
crucial for the chairman to be
capable of receiving tenure, but it
heard reports attesting to the
likelihood of only two candidates
receiving tenure--Smith and Ach-
olonu. No tenure report was given

_, on Porter. Finally, in reporting‘ the ,

 

committee vote, no mention was
made of the fact that Graylyn
Swilley, president of the BAS,
appeared unannounced at the last
search committee meeting when
the vote was scheduled on the
candidates. Despite the fact she
was not a member of the committee
and. had not attended a single
previous meeting, she was permit-
ted to vote in place of Jan Mouzon,
the regular BAS representative on
the committee, who had regularly
attended meetings from the begin-
ning and was therefore more
familiar with the committee’s
criteria and the records of the
candidates.

I make these statements because
certain, unspeciﬁed, procedures
used by the administration pre-
sumably biased the selection
against Porter; as the above-
mentioned irregularities attest, the
procedures of the search committee
chairman, to some extent, biased
the selection in his favor. Perhaps
the unfair procedures of the
administration were spelled out in
detail at that October 25 meeting
with the Chancellor. I don't know,
because inexplicably, only certain,
as yet publicly unidentiﬁed, mem-
bers of the search committee were
notified of that meeting and were
present._

This is the fourth in a series of
articleson the issues involved in
the US Senate race. Members of
the Pitt Young Socialist Alliance,
the Pitt College Republicans, and
the Pitt College Young Democrats
have been invited to submit articles
‘for this series concluding today.

revenue can be balanced by a cut in
federal spending. A tightening of
the belt on all federal bureaucrats
might be a good beginning.”

Pete believes, and rightly so, that
we must avoid using our nation’s
food supply indiscriminately for
political purposes at the expense of
our people. For example, the US
gave ‘/3 of its entire wheat crop to
Russia, allowing the State Depart-
ment to regulate our economy and
trigger a wheat shortage.

It’s unfair tothe people of this
nation not ‘to' wisely use our
resources to feed the hungry at
home and to reduce the burden of
day-to-day living expenses for the
working middle class.

Opposition is now unanimous.
However, at the time of the
Russian Wheat Deal, where were
our two Republican senators? Why
did they remain silent, willing to
allow the transaction to occur
without their protests? Also, why
have they voted for deficit
spending in each of the past five
years?

Throughout his political career as
mayor of Pittsburgh, Flaherty has
made government work for the
people instead of the lobbyists and
special interests. However, lobby-
ists and special interest groups still
control the major operations of the
federal government, as Lee Rich-
ardson indicated, when he recently
resigned from the Federal Energy
Office, protesting the oil barons’
control of the government’s federal
energy policy.

Pete captures the sentiments of a
large majority of Pennsylvania-
citizenry when he states
cannot afford to allow lobbyists and
special interests to control our
government any longer.“ It’s time
governmental officials on the

national level respond to the needs ~

and concerns of the people.
Lobbyists and special interests
must be removed from the major
operations of government.

The executive branch has called
for people to make tough decisions,
people who can cut governmental
spending and waste from the
federal budget. Flaherty has made
those tough decisions here in
Pittsburgh. He is asking for a
chance to counteract the high cost
of government and the big inﬂation
squeeze in Washington, DC.

Mayor Peter Flaherty is the
Democratic candidate for US
Senate. He has ‘proven he is a
friend of the working man and the
middle income wage earner. -He
strongly believes the federal
government must tighten its belt
before asking the taxpayers to
tighten theirs.

We should elect a man to the US
Senate who is aware of our
economic concerns. Don’t you
think the taxpayers have already
tightened their belts enough to
meet the additional cost of
inﬂation? Pete thinks so. How
about you?

Star Trek is only one of the many
computer games at Pitt, all of
which magnetically attract unsus-
pecting students in droves—and
often keep them enthralled until
the unfortunate creatures are sap-
ped of life and decent QPA’s. I’d
often heard tales of how these
games hold strange powers over
people...but I assured myself, as I
sat down to the computer terminal,
it would never get me.

The program advisor punched out
the proper command, and I started
playing one of the most basic
games, WAR.‘ As the computer
explained, I was the off1cer-in-
charge, giving orders ‘to the gun
crew by telling them the angle at
which totire. '

After successfully bombarding the
target several times, I fired at 90
degrees. The computer responded
immediately. “You idiot. You
Destroyed Your Own Position." I
pounded the machine for its snide
remark, and moved on to another
game.

I continued to play, game after
game. The computer would slyly
allow me one or two victories to
whet my taste for‘ glory, then
mercilessly crush me many times in
succession. _The machine knew it
was driving me to madness, so it
continued to print out statements of
stinging ridicule. I refused to be
intimidated. ,

By the time I regained my senses,
I had played (and usually lost)
several games of War, Landing on
the Moon. Marbles, Black Jack,
Slot Machine, and Tic-Tac-Toe. I
had also skipped a class, forgotten
toeat, and missed my bus home.
As the computer whined and
hummed, I could have sworn I
heard it laugh.

Although many of these computer
games are frowned upon the com-
puter science department, anybody

with a computer number can learn
to play the more basic games by
talking to a program advisor. But
think about what you’re doing
before you sit down to play. You
may become a permanent fixture in
G-25.

_/ , . It matters because of Walt Harper, Walt Harper’s band, the location
 the Attic, the attitude of Walt Harper and especially the -total

importance of such a nightclub.

Recently, I spent an evening at the Attic. «At the time Jacques Brel is
Alive and Well and Living in Paris was playing, as it still is. The decor .
was comfortable, the theatrical attempt realistic, the music excellent.

Jacques Brel is a smooth,‘ comfortable mixture of music and drama,
limited of course in terms of props and setting, an excellent choice for

dinner-theatre-nightclub.

The production pinpoints the guts of

Q

Jacques Brel’s music, the hate-love conﬂict, the sweetness and

bitterness of both love and death."

With what little stage room available the dancing was a mixture of
grace, and stiff, static force. With little possible orchestra room the
music was varied, sweet and distant but also powerfully close. A credit
to co-producer and musical director, Carl Geruschat.

The cast of Lynn Beckstrom,- Chris MacLaine, Beth Austin and Dan
Madia gave no impressions of limitation. Drawing heavily on accented
facial impressions, varied voices and tone, each piece worked within
,jf‘}f1iself while not sidestepping the total movement of the musical review.
‘ i In much the same way, changes in stage and musical movement were

semi-drastic enough to again, carry each piece individually without

losing grasp of the whole.

“Modmon” Mixes Good, Bad, And...?,

BY TOBI ROSEN
Back -and forth and up- and down
and back again. The gleam in his
eyes possess a demon"-like glow.‘
His mind never stops to rest.
With this singular visual image,
director Bruce Pribram has created
the perfect metaphor: the caged
stalking tiger who remains perpet-
ually in motion. And is that where
the mad belong? In cages to
contemplate their own madness?
But what of the “sane”? Are they

' on the outside only because of their

skill in playing the game?
Questions like these and others are
superficially handled in Stanislaw
Witkeiwcz’s The Madman and the
Nun. ‘

The entire evening settled into’
categories of the good, the bad,
and the worst. Ryun Cutrona"s
brilliant portrayal. of the poet
turned madman can only be
classified as the “good” (possibly
even the best.) He shone out like a
diamond among a gravel pit. Yet he
has an uncanny capacity to disturb
and move our senses.

And until a somewhat rash and
confused ending, Witkiewcz builds
the momentum through the mad-
man. For example, the opening
sequence drags, particularly due to
poor acting, but mainly because the
tiger has not yet been unleashed to
spring and attack. Cutrona has
created a translucient texture to his V
madman. Motivations behind each
line were disguised and hidden.
Never does he stoop to hysterical"
madness for emphasis’ sake. He’,s
too subtle and sophisticated an
actor. i

 Even

BY JIM SPANOS

Pitt’s soccer team has an excellent
opportunity to even their season’s
record this Saturday, as they travel
to Gannon College in northern
Pennsylvania.

“We should win,” says Pitt
soccer coach Leo Bemis, and if Pitt
emerges jvictorious, it will even
their season’s slate at 4-4-2. The

Panthers will start the game 4-2-4 

alignment which they have used for
the most part of the season.
‘W Starting at the fullbacks will be
‘fJerry Luxbacher, Chet Venanzi,
Ernie Gross, and either Andy
Behrend or Stan Sbei. The defense
has played remarkably well all
year, and Pitt’s opponents have
only scored eight goals in the last
six games against the Cats.
Comparing common opponents of
the two schools this season, Gan-
non beat Grove City 4-1, lost to
Slippery Rock 6-3, and was beaten
by Edinboro by a 2-1 margin. On
the other hand, the Panthers
defeated Grove City 3-2, tied the

1-1.
_,m...,h“Gannon is gradually getting
“W better,” Bemis remarked. “They
have some good players, but they
also have some players who they’re
still teaching how to play. If we go
up there and play the game the way
we can, then we’ll win. We should
win these next two games.”
After playing Gannon, the Pan-

Rock 0-0, and also tied the Scots

season. .

Goalie Frank Bucci will have an
extremely crucial job to do the
remainder of the season in pre-
venting the opponent from scoring.

A freshman, Bucci has done an
outstanding job in net, as has
another freshman, Fred Dohrmann
when Bucci didn’t play. Those two
freshmen deserve a considerable
amount of credit for holding the
opponents to a small number of
goals.

each weekend.

Romano grew up just a punt away
from Syracuse University, in So]-

he'll be terrorizing Saturday. That
is, if he gets the chance.

The 6-3, 220 pound sophomore
pulled a groin muscle against the
Navy last Saturday, and has prac-

Majors listed his Thursday as
“questionable” but keeping Ro-
mano out of this game would be
like keeping Attila and his hunkies
out of a ﬁght.

“In a way I have something"to
prove because I have a lot- of
friends coming to see me play,”
Romano said.

What he has proved so far is this
mustachioed Italian is too good to
waste on the bench. Originally, the
coaches had groomed him to take
over Gary, Burley’s middle guard
spot. But when Burley was injured
last season, Romano stepped in

The Pitt football team has not won
in Syracuse's Archbold Stadium
since 1960 when they snapped a 16
game Orange streak. But then the
Panthers didn’t win many games
anywhere back in the 60’s.
Nevertheless, the jinx still remains
and if the Panthers are going to
ﬁnally break the curse of ‘Ancient
Archie’s Stadium, they are going to
have to beat a football team that
has had two weeks to prepare for
tomorrow's game and will be ﬁred
up in an attempt to. upset the
favored Panthers.

The Orangemen are currently
nursing a 2-5 record but records
can sometimes 'be deceiving.
They have been in every game up
until the fourth quarter with the
possible exception of their 31-0 loss

.to Maryland. Syracuse has im-

proved quite substantially since
last year’s miserable 2-9 season
which included a 28-14 defeat at

he is one of the smallest defensive

Wednesday morning's title ﬁght
Muhammad Ali, the challenger,
‘said-, “I’m gonna completely

~« outclass this man tonight.”

Of course, “this man” was then
heavyweight champion George
Foreman, who had held the title
since he reduced Joe Frazier to
rubble in January ’73, so Ali’s
words were characteristically
strong. Foreman had 40 wins in 40
fights, with 37, including the last
24 straight, by knockout. He hadn't

 been pushed beyond the second

round in any of his last eight ﬁghts

' -- hardly the type of man who’s

likely to be “outclassed.”

But by the time dawn broke in
Kinshasa, Ali looked every bit as
prophetic as his namesake and
hero, Elijah Muhammad: he had
destroyed the indestructible Fore-
man by a knockout at 2:58 of ‘the
eighth round. “It wasn't a close
ﬁght, was it?” Ali asked reporters.
No, it wasn’t. Only in the first
round, which was relatively even,
did Ali do the kind of‘ dancing he’s
Thereafter he
‘spent most of the ﬁght relaxing

His Stolen Championship

against the ropes and protecting
his face with his forearms, but
seldom did the champion connect
with blows of any signiﬁcance.
“Using the ropes can be
beautiful,” Ali said, “when you
make him take his best shots and
heis missing. I just let him swing
his arms at me for a couple of
rounds,~ and after that, he was
mine.” ’ _
Just occasionally, Ali ventured off
the ropes to return Foreman’s ﬁre,
and looked good doing it. He
connected with some solid counter-
punches, and also did a lot of
damage while he was backing
away. It seemed he was just testing

Foreman, to see if the strain of-

throwing those huge .arms around
was beginning to show.

In the ﬁfth round, Ali’ spent the
ﬁrst 2:20 leaning on the ropes, as

»he had since the first. Then he

must have seen whatever he’d
been looking for in Foreman’s
attack: he struck out with a brutal
series of punches. The last of them
was a ringing right to the side of

Foreman’s‘head, and the ﬁght was

in Ali’s hands from then on.

Harriers Place Fourth

/It  Ilwitrttiolirrl

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

A depleted corps of Pitt runners
placed a disappointing fourth be-
hind Michigan, host Kent State and
Edinboro at ‘the UN Day Invita-
tional cross-country meet last Sat-
urdav.

Veteran Nick Martin placed ﬁfth
to lead the Panthers, who were
without the services of an excellent
freshman runner, Tom Herman.
Another freshman, Melvin Boyd,
placed eighth in the meet and
second on the squad.

“Time-wise, we ran well,” said
Pitt coach Jim Banner, “but we
didn’t get as much improvement as
I thought we should."

Another of the freshmen crop
Banner calls “tremendous’,’ is
Dave McDonald, who ran at Kent
State but didn’t place high. “A
couple of our freshmen are having
trouble going from 21/2 to six
miles,” Banner said. “It’s a
difﬁcult transition to make.

A

“It used to be we’d have a special
program for freshmen where
they’d only have to run three miles.

But they would be ready for six by
the time they were sophomores,
but now it’s harder, especially
since these guys (Herman, Boyd
and McDonald) were only milers or
half-milers in high school.”

Banner has been disappointed
with the performance of sophomore
Terry Wile, the other of Pitt’s top
five runners. “He’s not perform-
ing up to his potential, right now.
But it takes time to mature in
distance.”

Pitt should be at full strength for
its upcoming meet with Penn State.

“They're 'a tough team,” Banner
said, “and they have three solid
veteran runners. It’ll. be a close
rrget. We also have the IC4A’
coming up November 18, and the
nationals November 24. I expect
we'll have a few runners qualify for
them.”

way around. They have given  »

2672 yards and 152 points so far
this season with most of the
yardage coming on the ground. The
Orange defensive line is not very
big although they have been able to
compensate for their lack of size
with their quickness and strength.

Monster man John Rafferty is the
top player on defense. He is quick
and has been a key man in the
many stunts the Orange have used.
Rafferty has gotten some valuable
assistance from linebacker Ray
Preston and wide halfback Tim
Moresco with both players turning
three interceptions.

turned one of his three steals into at '

touchdown on a 24 yard run.

The Orange were off last week
giving them plenty of time to heal
any injuries they may have suffered
at Penn State. It has -also given
them an opportunity to work on
some new things that they wouldn’t
have had time for in only four days
of practice.

“Basically what we tried to do in
the layoff was work with our

younger players and maintain ourv , '

conditioning,” said Maloney.

So the Panthers have their work‘ :4

cut out for them tomorrow. The
Panthers will be facing a young
enthusiastic squad that is deﬁnitely
tired. of losing. But, it’s about time
the Cats proved there was nothing
to the Archbold curse."

Ali allowed Foreman to punch at
will for nearly three full rounds
after that, but the champion was
obviously dazed and exhausted,
and his shots were no more than
meaningless taps. Like the 60,000
plus at Vingt du Mai Stadium, the
predominantly black crowd of 500
at East Liberty’s Sheridan Square
Theatre shouted impatiently for*Ali
to put him away.

The only question was when, and
Ali answered it near the end of
Round 8. He sidestepped Fore-
man’s awkward lunge with a

: ,,lgft-right combination that left him

Jfnging to the ropes, and when
Foreman staggered off them, Ali
was ready.

 He straightened Foreman up with

an uppercut left to the chin, and
followed it with a crushing right.
Foreman looked like 226 pounds of
disjointed rubber as he reeled away
on his right foot and landed on his
back. Only as the count reached
nine did he even attempt to regain
his feet.

“I told you all I was the greatest of
all time,” Ali said. “Never again
say I’m going to be defeated until
I’m about 50 years old.”

Ali’s victory was an important one
for boxing, which has suffered from
scandals, adverse publicity and
poor promotions in recent years. It
showed that in boxing, as in all of
the more respected sports, brute
physical power alone is not enough
to win.

Ali beat Foreman by devising a
successful strategy, and by outwit-

ting him. He said he’d dance-

before the ﬁght, and practiced little
else but dancing in his workouts.
He dazzled the crowd with an
amazing display of footwork just
before the ﬁght, and Foreman must
have been prepared for anything
but the sight of Ali spli_tting his
weight between his heels and the
ropes.

To add to the charade, Ali’s
trainer, Angelo Dundee, who
predicted the knockout and just
missed the round, kept yelling,
“Get off the ropes! Get away from
those ropes!” Foreman was not
prepared to face Ali’s strategy, and
he fought a bewildered fight as a
result.

Also, Ali’s inﬂammatory remarks
toward Foreman succeeded in
getting his goat before the ﬁght
