University

Senate

discusses plans for
renovating campus

_:g;;~"§;;

 

Within the past few
months, Pitt has ban creating a
plan that will signiﬁcantly
change student life on campus.

Within the University
Senate a special committee
known as the Capital Planning
Committee has been working
closely with faculty, staff, and
students in an attempt to create a
plan that will take the University
into the 21st century.

The report of the Capital
Planning Committee was
addressed yesterday afternoon
in the VVrlliam Pitt Union at the
University Senate meeting.

Chancellor Nordenberg
spoke early in the meeting and
emphasized the importance of

the document.

“The upcoming years that
we will be facing will not be
easy due to economic con-
straints,” said Nordenberg, “Our
future depends on our ability to
effectively utilize University
fimding to create an attractive,
hospitable campus.”

The report of the Capital
Planning Committee was
launched in early 1995 before
Nordenberg became Interim
Chancellor. The oomrnittee was
initially asked to approve a pre-
existing spending plan.

In later months, however,
the comrrrittee’s task was broad-
ened to include the budgets in
athletics and recreation. As a
result, six new members were
added to increase the dimension

Students say candidates
should act on sitcoms

According to a Pitt News’
survey of students after the
presidential debates, few
young voters are willing to
change their minds about
either main candidate.

A group of Pitt students
were interviewed after the
presidential debates, and a
series of political advertise-
ments ran for them in order to
get an understanding of how
these ads inﬂuence young vot-
ers.

Surprisingly, students said
they weren’t inﬂuenced at all
by the candidates’ commer-
cials, intemet sites, debates, or
appearances.

Students interviewed said

they don’t think enough carn-
paigns are aimed at them
except for a few token appear-
ances on MTV.

Some of the students said
candidates could market
themselves better if they
advertise on networks and sit-
coms that young voters watch
—— not just MTV, but on shows
like “Friends,” “ER,” and
“Seinfeld.”

During breaks in those
programs last week, there was
not one political ad.

“The best way to get the
young vote is to appeal your-
self and gear advertisements at
us,” said Mike Bennett, a 24-
year old Republican and com-
munications major.

SAN DIEGO —— Yesterday’s presidential
debate was being billed as the deﬁning

moment of this year’s campaign. Underdog
Dole was trying to unseat Bill Clinton as king
of this race.

Tuesday, Dole began his character ques-
tions about President Clinton with stinging
attacks on Clir1ton’s character. Dole accused
him of betraying voter’s trust and presiding
over one of the most unethical administra-
tions in history.

“I don’t know of any administration that
has been more self-righteous. But few have
displayed more ethical failures,” Dole said on
Tuesday to a group of electronics executives.

misconduct.”

One ofthe things that Clinger was talk-
ing about was the FBI background ﬁles on
oﬂicials from Reagan and Bush’s administra-
tions that the Clinton administration alleged-
ly took During his investigation, he said of
the Clinton administration that his committee
“encountered a systematic and sustained
resistance  as well as an incredible display
of faulty memories and missing documents.”

'l'I'IE PI'l"I' NEWS

Klink claims cuts can't be

Mott Samuels

 

People used to tell Ron Klink that there
was no diﬂ"erence between the Republican
and Democratic parties. But when the for-
mer KDKA news anchorrnan got to
Washington, D.C., he found that the differ-
ence was profound.

Klink, a democrat who is the current
Pennsylvania congressman from the 4th dis-
trict (Allequippa and surrounding commu-
nities), spoke to the University Democrats
on Monday night about the dangers of keep-
ing a Republican majority in Congress.

He told students about three major tasks
the Republican Congress pushed over the
past four years: increase defense spending,
decrease taxes, and balance the budget.

“I can’t see how we can take in less
money, spend more and still balance the
budget.” said Klink. “The only way it’s pos-
sible is to rob a bank.”

Klink blamed Republicans like Newt
Gingrich for trying to limit the growth of
Medicare and Medicaid, which, in Klink’s
eyes, is like cutting them. He also mentioned
cuts in student aid, a hot topic here on cam
pus. He talked about direct lending, a pro
gram where students can get a loan through
their own school as opposed to through a
bank.

Klink said Republicans also intend to
make cuts in the Summer Youth Programs,
which help impoverished youth leam trades
and get jobs during the summer. He also

spoke about cuts on Drug Free School pro-
grams and the Head Start program, which
the Republicans created and previously sup
ported.

Klink said that Democrats fought off
the “Republican wave of cuts” with
President Clinton, who “wasn’t afraid to
veto these cuts.”

“This election isn’t about the next two
or four years, it is about the next genera-
tion,” said Klink. “If they push these cuts
through now, it will take years to repair the
damage.”

Klink, however, is opposed to the
Brady Bill, and the assault weapons ban,
two Democrat-sponsored bills for gun con-
trol and waiting periods. He said he believes
that the Brady Bill is unconstitutional, and
that the assault weapons ban was poorly
written. Klink even supports presidential
candidate Bob Dole’s idea of an instant
background check on ftreamts purchases.

Even though he lends his support there,
he is still vehemently opposed to the
Republican party. He regards the upcoming
election as a war.

“lfl could give up my seat in Congress
to insure a Democratic majority. and the
presidents re—election, I would do it." said
Klink.

He said he hopes he can look back
when the elections are over and say he did
all he could to help the Democrats win this
election. He faces the upcoming election
with a quote from Ed Hams in the movie
Apollo 13: “Failure is not an option.”

Among the swarming bees and smell
of peanut butter and jelly, students were
on the steps of the William Pitt Union
yesterday making the popular gooey
sandwiches for a special cause.

“We are making sandwiches to feed
hungry people,” explained Lynne
Annapolle, a member of the Hillel
Foundation.

Some of the sandwiches will be
picked up and others will be delivered by
the Hillel Foundation to the Rainbow
Kitchen, Light of Life Mission, YMCA
McKeesport, La Rosa Boys’ and Girls’
Club, Deborah’s House in Braddock, and
Mary’s Church in Red Door.

Students share favorite lunch with homeless

Numerous organizations, such as Circle
K, the Jewish University Center, Lamda
Sigma, Phi Kappa Theta, Phi Sigma Pi,
and others, were represented.

Taking place on World Food Day,
three other campuses in Pittsburgh,
including Duquesne, Chatham, and
Carnegie Mellon, held similar events.

“With all of us working together, we
hope to make 5,000 sandwiches,” said
Jane Berger, also with the Hillel
Foundation.

The event was kicked off yesterday
morning at 11 after Ken Siegal, of Just
Harvest, spoke about the cause. Just
Harvest is a political action group that
rallies on behalf of the hungry in the
Pittsburgh area. Siegal lobbies to City
Council and works with other organiza-

tions in the area to help the hungry.

“This is a great thing,” Berger said.
“It’s a great way to get people involved,
and it’s right out in front of the union
where everyone can see us and partici-
pate. Some people come by and say they
have a half hour until class, and they can
help out, which is super.”

Other students agreed that spending
an afternoon or even a few minutes help-
ing to feed the hungry was worth their
time.

“It’s a good idea,” said Kelly Bixler,
of Circle K. “There was even a homeless
guy who came up to us saying how he
enjoys having free food.”

Scott Malik, of Phi Kappa Theta,
agreed, saying that it’s such a great cause
around the holiday time or just any time.

Driver

While the police ran through the pro-
cedures of the traffic stop, students danced
around the car, shaking signs and chanting
“Keep Bigelow Closed.”

Officer Amanda Ford, of the Pitt
Police, said the individual was uncoopera-
tive but “Officer Nemeck was the officer
who wrote the ticket, and he basically told
him that ‘You have your opportunity to
ﬁght it in court if you disagree with the
charges.’”

After being pulled over, the driver,
who refused to identify himself, said he
thought the road was open because of a
news report he heard. “They said the road
was open,” he said.

The driver also said he didn’t think
the ticket was fair and was going to con-
test it in court. ‘”I‘hat’s the news for you,
they get things wrong.”

Apparently, so did the driver.

“He was cited with careless driving,”
said Officer Ford. “There was a blockade
up by the police unit. The fact that he
drove up on the sidewalk to get around our
vehicles  also put him on the wrong side
of the ma .”

When asked how he felt about the
Bigelow closing, the driver said “I don’t
know. I have mixed feelings about it. If it’s
fun for [the students], then it should be
open.”

The driver was told to turn his car
around and return to traﬁic on Forbes
Avenue. Only 12 minutes later, Bigelow
Boulevard was open again to city traffic.

Senate 

and scope of the capital allocation plan.

The speciﬁc parts of the plan deal with
constructing new athletic and academic
facilities, increasing on—campus student
housing, building more fraternity houses on
campus, and renovating already existing
facilities on Pitt’s campus.

Robert Pack, vice provost for
Academic Planning and Resources
Management, said these changes must be
made because more students live on-cam-
pus and rely entirely on University facilities
now.

Seventy-eight percent of the students
thatcomprisethec1assof2000cornefrom
other areas of Pemrsylvania and other
states, while only 22 percent come from the
Greater Pittsburgh area.

According to Pack, with more students
coming from other areas, Pitt must increase
and update its facilities not only to deal with
the increased student population on campus
butalsoasameansofattractingnewstu-
dents to Pitt.

According to the Capital Plan, one of
the ways to meet these goals is to strength-
en the athletic facilities on campus. This
will be accomplished by constructing a
new Convocation Center for basketball
games, by increasing funding for the foot-
ball program, by building a new recreation-

Bennett said he hasn’t seen any can-
didates appealing to the younger vote.

“I haven’t really seen any ads geared

Bennett said MTV has influenced his
vote more than any other media outlet.

tive in educating and introducing us to
the candidates,” Bennett said. “In fact,

critical of ads, so they really do not effect

al and fitness center for Pitt students, and by
improving on the recreational facilities
such as Trees Hall and the Fitzgerald Field
House.

Kenneth Metz, dean of the School of
Education said the athletic facilities need to
be renovated because few of them have
been improved at all during the past 30
years.

“None of those facilities [are] adequate
to handle the increase in student population,
the growth of the NCAA, and the growth of
women’s sports,” he said. “The plan is
designed to alleviate the athletic facilities
crunch."

Metz said some immediate need can
be addressed with minimum expense to the
University.

“For example. outdoor field space is
almost nonexistent in regards to soccer. ten-
nis, softball, et cetera." he said. “So one of
the immediate things is to put outdoor play-
ing ftelds on campus."

According to the Capital Plan. another
way to improve student life is to build more
on-campus housing and increase fratemity
housing.

It also calls for a “housing resource
center" for students looking for apartment‘
and homes off campus.

According to Dennis McMzmnis. 1
member of the Capital Planning
C ommittee. ‘This document encourage:
fratemities to move on campus and calls to
increased student housing. It also calls fo
the University to take on a more active ml.
in guaranteeing that their students who liv.
off campus receive adequate. safe hous
ing.“

The final way the committee hopes I
improve Pitt is by making sure each acadc
mic prognmi has enough physical space o
campus for their operation.

Pitt is also plarming on investing
minimum of $3 million each year on tl
renovation of already existing academ
buildings and constructing a new science
building that will provide new resources
and materials for majors such as computer
science, psychology, and neuroscience.

“Obstructing traffic is obstructing traf-

Students organizing the rally opposed
the blockade planned by these students.

"The police and drivers really aren’t
doing anything wrong,” said Jennifer
Molluso, SGB’s Bigelow task force direc-
tor. “I don’t condone blocking the road at all.
We were given a chance, a trial closing, and
 everyone knew it would reopen.”

_ Molluso said students should find a
more positive way of keeping Bigelow
closed.

“Stage one, the trial, is now complete,”
she said. “Now it is time for the students to
show that. they support the permanent clo-
sure Of the road. By calling 255-8996, stu-
dents have the opportunity to use their voice
where it is the most signiﬁcant —— the city

. As the official opening drew closer,
more than 150 students gathered at the rally
held on the Cathedral’s lawn and made their
way down into the street, holding signs and
banging drums.

As the clock struck 12, the Pitt Police
pulled their cars ﬁom either end of Bigelow
Boulevard, and the ﬁrst car to drive on the
road in one month rolled past the protestors
beeping its hom furiously among the chant-
ing students.

“Keep Bigelow Closed! Keep Bigelow

shouted. “Why be afraid of the police?”

His cry was answered by a lone student
standing in the shadows of a tree on the
Cathedral lawn. “I have priors,” that student
said. “I don’t need to get in trouble over
crossing the street.”

As time wore on and the cops’ patience
wore thin, most of the protestors made sure
they stayed Off the road, too.

“This has gone on too long now!” Pitt
Police Sgt. J. Chester announced to a group
: of students prepar—
 ing_ to cross the
 road again. “It’s a

“I thought I had people with me, but I
ended up in the middle of the street by

Though it only takes one person to
block a car, Parr still didn’t think it was
worth it.

“One person will get run Over,” he said.
“I want to die for some cause, but not for

“There are a lot of cops who are out
here who are arrest happy, and they would

i start to arrest people,” she said. “They want

some action to occur and are happy to use
their force.”

Not everyone had ill feelings towards
the police, and SEAC member Jed Netzler
said be appreciated their efforts that night.

“I’d just like to sincerely thank the Pitt
police for holding the road closed until mid-
night as the contract said, even when the
barriers were gone,” Netzler said. ‘That was
very cool.”

Drivers on the road said the opening
was pretty cool, too.

“It is okay for me. I need to go to my
apartment, and to my lab this way,” said Lee
Shao as he sat at the red light.

Another unidentiﬁed driver said he
supported the closing, but after being asked
why he was driving on the road he only
shouted: “It saves gas, bro!” and sped away.

By 12:30 am. most of the crowd was
gone, too. Afew organizers were left, hang-
ing posters on trees, and cleaning up after
the bands.

“We just wanted to prove that the shut
down increased student morale,” said
Molluso, as the crowd dissipated. “We did-
n’t want to get anybody upset.”

Until then she said students should
write or call the city and express their views
on the shutdown.

“We’re not laying down in the road
though,” she said. “That’s just not appropri-
ate.”

[IEJVIEWS

The Capital Planning Committee of the
University Senate unveiled the report it began com-
piling in early 1995 yesterday.

There are some basic ﬂaws to this plan, which
focuses more on space constraints and sports than on
the academic foundation of this educational institu-
tion.

One of the focal points of the plan is to build
more housing facilities on campus. The plan would
like to bring the off-campus fraternities back into the
fold. There is nothing wrong with fraternity members
living on campus. If a student who happens to be in a
fraternity would like to live on campus, there are
plenty of dorms to choose from. But housing that is
for the usage of a single fraternity should be the
responsibility of the fraternity to provide, not the
University. Fraternities are part of national chapters
which are supposed to be their guiding inﬂuence and
benefactors. Pittshould let them house themselves.

The plan also has provisions in it for renovating
Trees Hall and Fitzgerald Field House. This is the
'_ighlight of the plan. Trees and the Field House are
Jadly in need of updating and maintaining. As these
facilities are for the usage of the entire campus, keep-
ing them in tip—top condition is a bonus for everyone.

However, building a new recreational and fitness
center for students seems to be rather cavalier in light
of the fact that the University spent the money to
build a ﬁtness center in Lothrop just last year. What
was the point of spending the money to do that when
the Capital Planning Committee was working on a
plan which includes more ﬁtness facilities?

As Chancellor Nordenberg noted in his remarks
about the report, Pitt is facing economic constraints
as it heads into the 21 st century. Wouldn’t that money
be better spent providing more scholarships and
grants for students, and by upgrading and innovating
the educational programs at this campus? It is the
University’s main responsibility to worry about exer-
cising our minds. Our bodies are our own problem.

We need more givers and fewer

 

I was talking to my uncle about
the election the other day, and we
were both trying to figure out why
Bill Clinton is ahead by a substantial
margin. There are certainly a num-
ber of reasons, but my uncle brought
up an interesting explanation. He
said that the number of takers is
finally larger than the number of
payers in this country. In other
words, there are now more people
receiving government assistance in
some form than those who are
pulling their own weight.

It was once predicted that
democracies were destined to fail as
soon as their people realized that
they could vote themselves money.

That is exactly what has been
happening in the United States over
the last several decades.
Entitlements are always introduced
with the intention of helping a par-
ticular group. This group usually
lobbies enthusiastically for their
cause, and the rest of the nation
rarely puts up any real opposition.
Then, as the entitlement grows larg-
er and stronger, its targeted group
relies on the assistance and sees it as
a right. The growth of such pro-
grams has, of course, coincided with
a continually rising tax burden.
Unfortunately, Americans have been
slow to notice higher taxes, but they
have become more sensitive to any
reductions in their precious entitle-
ments.

Medicare and Social Security
are perfect examples of this trend.

Before they were created, peo-
ple actually saved their own money.
Now, they have little extra money to
save, and they are forced to rely on

the government to assist them.
Workers pay six percent of their
income to Social Security, and this
sum is matched by employers.
Unfortunately, when I start working,
the government isn’t going to come
and ask me if I wish to save for my
own retirement. Everyone is forced
into the dependency trap. After
years of paying into the system, peo-
ple aren’t about to let the govem-
ment eliminate their beneﬁts. Thus,
the elderly have become staunch
Democrats.

Welfare, Medicaid, and pro-
grams such as school lunches also
serve this purpose. Instead of creat-
ing opportunities for the poor to
work, the government pays them for
having more babies and not work-
ing. If we wanted to give them
money, why don’t we eliminate their
taxes and give them money for tak-
ing minimum-wage jobs. If we cut
all of the other government pro-
grams targeting the poor, we could
easily afford such measures. But
then again, all of these people would
start voting Republican, and we just
can’t have that.

Slowly but surely, liberals are
creating a state of “cradle to grave”
dependency. We start our citizens
out by giving them Medicaid and
school lunches, then we fund their
college educations, and then when
they join the work force, they begin
to pay the government to fund their
retirements. And if they are unem-
ployed or disabled, they rely on
Uncle Sam even more heavily.
Thus, big government has systemat-
ically broken the arms and legs of
the American people and forced
them to beg for mercy. (If you
remember that line from an article of
mine last year, you have way too

to ke rs

much time on your hands.)

As we have created more and
more government programs with the
intention of being kind-hearted and
caring, we have forgotten about the
toll it is taking on the American peo-
ple. We are truly headed toward a
state of serfdom, with the fruits of
our labor going to government
bureaucrats and politicians who
control our lives. The time will
come when we can’t sustain the run-
away spending of the federal gov-
ernment anymore. For instance,
Medicare is growing at a rate of
around 10 percent annually. The
overall economy is increasing at
close to 2.5 percent per year. It does-
n’t take a genius to realize that this
trend can’t continue forever. When
Medicare was created, its supporters
projected an annual cost of $9 bil-
lion by 1990. Its actual cost was
about $70 billion in that year.
Virtually every government pro-
gram also follows this trend.
Slowing their growth is the least we
can do at this point. I honestly

believe that anyone voting for '

Clinton for economic reasons is
either ignorant or in denial of reality.

President Clinton has been talk-
ing about building a “bridge to the
future” and improving the lives of
the young. If he really meant it, he
would get serious about cutting
taxes and controlling entitlements,
thus freeing the American people.
However, Democrats are trying to
maintain and increase our state of
dependency. This is the only way
they can stay in power. The more I
think about it, the more I realize that
Bob Dole is the only logical choice
this election year.

rant liberals at -mamst85.

Curfews are no solution to crime woes

 

Before you move the fumiture to do that
back hand spring you’ve been practicing all

week in celebration of teenage curfews, slow

down. Sit and think the situation through
before you break a bone or two. Someone
may be setting you up for a major disap-
pointment. A

Although implementing teenage cur-
fews seems like a welcoming plan of action
to defeat youth  it has serious ﬂaws.

First of all, putting a curfew on all ado-
lescents is like calling them all potential crim-
inals. Despite what we see on the news and in
daily papers, the majority of teenagers are
not rtmning wild They are not sex-crazy,
uncaring, thoughtless, juvenile delinquents as
we’ve come to believe.

True, some are misguided. Granted
there have been times I’ve wanted to put one
in a ﬁgure-four leg lock when he or she acts
ignorant.

But punishing all for the crimes of a
small percentage is unjust.

How can “hanging out” get you arrest-
ed? That really doesn’t make sense. Being
out past curfew, (which varies from 8 or 9
pm on weekdays and 10 or 11 pm. on
weekends) does not merit an arrest

An honest teen who stays out of trouble

can add an anest record to the list of achieve-
ments on his college application.

Then they have to attend counseling ses-
sions. Counseling? For what? On how to tell
time? In some cities, if a teen is arrested again
for violating curfew, they could receive two
or more months in juvenile detention centers.
I fail to see the logic in our governrnent’s
methodologies.

President Clinton and other otﬁcials are
quick to boast about reducuons in youth
crimes since starting curfews, but neglect to
inform us of the other factors involved

The main reason curfews have worked,
in some areas, is because the cities have given
many teens alternatives to just hanging out.
Day and evening employment and volrmteer
programs, religious and social organization
involvement, and extended recreation center
horns have had greater impacts because they
give our youth something to do. But as
expected, these community efforts are being
threatened by Congressional budget cuts.

Themostalarrningﬂawisthatthesecur-
fews will effect inner city youth more, espe-
ciallyblackandlatinoyouth,whoarealready
targets for constant police scrutiny and stops.
To give police greater authority to stop and
arrestthemisgivingtherntherighttoharass
teenagers just because they’re teenagers.

I understand that there is a severe prob-
lern when our teens are out committing

crimes we only read about or think only
adultsdo.Thereisnodoubtthatsometeens
areactingasiftheyhavenomorals,asifthey
don’t know the difference between right and
wrong. But it is unfair to blame them all.

Criminal teens can already be tried and
convicted as adults for some crimes and their
parents can be punished for not taking
responsibility for their children. They can be
put in prison (although prison could make
them worse criminals).

Crime can happen at any time. If some-
one wants to commit a crime, they’ll ﬁnd the
timetodoit. Hell,Igotjurnpedonthesub-
way when I was in the ninth grade. It was
about 3:30 in the afternoon.

Ifthere was something for them to do,
like jobs and extracurricular activities, crimes
among youth would be greatly reduced on a
nation-wide level. But as long as the govem—
ment continues to slash programs which
could help our youth, the outlook doesn't
look promising.

But once again, we can’t throw rocks at
the government for everything. Some of soci-
ety needs to be tied up and stoned V

lfteens wanttobetreated like responsi-
ble adults, they have to act like responsible
adults. And parents  love your kids. For
sorneteens,beingoutinthestreetsissafer
thanbeinginthehouse.VVrthviolenceand
substance abuse running rampant through

our homes, the child you force to go home
could show up on tomonow’s evening news,
the next homicide case.

What’s going on? Is our society that ill,
that we’ve allowed the govemment to place
curfews on our children? Have parents truly
lost touch with their children‘? Do some teens
really not care?

Whatever happened to your mom stick-
ingherheadoutthewindow and screaming
your name for you to come in? Her voice
could be heard for a ﬁve—block radius.
Although you were clowned by your friends,
you moved your butt to avoid getting that
beating. Now, instead of hearing rnom’s
voice, the red and blue lights and the “Woop-
Woop” of 5-0’s sirens do the duty.

I was sitting around the other day,watch—
ing and episode of Von the SCI—FI channel,
whenthispartcameonwherethishuman
was stopped by an alien guard for being out
past curfew. A disturbing thought came to
me.

If our government believes these cur-
fews are effective in stopping adolescent
crimes, who’s to say they won’t try curfews

to end adult crimes? How long will it be

beforeadultsareorderedtobeinsidebya

The political process is wrought with party flaws

   

As an individual with an avid
interest in politics and government,
I have long had worries about the
future of the United States. My
anxiety over the future was recent-
ly exacerbated by a 10-part series
of articles that ran recently in _the
Philadelphia Inquirer entitled
“America Who Stole the Dream?”
It was the result of research by two
investigaﬁve reporters which paint-
edableakpicttrreforthefuture: an
America increasingly divided
between the rich and poor, people
working longer and harder and for
less, and a growing elite that pays
litIleintaxesandgetsalloftheben-
eﬁts.

For example, as stated in the
Inquirer article, in 1970, the mid-
dle class (defined as those who
earn between $20,000 to $75,000 a
year) numbered 57 percent of all
income tax ﬁlers, while the poor
made up about 39 percent and the
wealthy just four percent. In 1995,
the middle class had shrrmk to just
47 percent, while the poor and the
rich had increased to make up 45
percent and eight percent of the
number of people ﬁling income

with those 10 countries has since
gone from $2 billion to $161 bil-
lion in 1995? That is a 7,950 per-
cent increase.

With the current elite-dorni-
nated two-party system, voters
don’t have much of an opporumity
to break the corruption cycle. The

New Republic magazine nick-
named the democratic elite the
“Rhodes Scholar maﬁa” because
so many members of the Clinton
administration had gone to Yale
and Harvard and were former
Rhodes Scholars. In 1992, the
bipartisan group Common Cause
detailed what they called “George
Bush’s Ruling Class,” a group of
249 wealthy republicans who gave
at least $100,0(X) to the Republican
Party and were rewarded for their
donations.

In 1994, the Republican Party
pledged to change America if they

Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich told contributors in 1994.
The current Congress has been
bought and paid for by special

tobacco lobby, and assorted inclus-
try groups. The ﬂagrant corruption
of the 104th Congress stunned
rmny reporters, who watched as
business lobbies actually had their

One Republican freshman con-
gressman actually made the ludi-
crous claim last year that the mid-
dle class was anyone making
$300,000 to $750,000 a year.

Republican analyst and
reform advocate Kevin Phillips
hopes that the Republicans will
lose control ofCongress this fall so
that Gingrich and his cronies will
no longer be in a position to cause
further harm. Taking the reins
away from Gingrich and his
cronies is a start. Reforming
Arnerica’s campaign ﬁnance laws
(which the Republicans actually
weakened last year to get goodies
from their contributors) should be
next, along with the formation of a
viable third political party to give
the American people a real choice.

Pitt’s campus starvation camp strategy is crap

   

They say music soothes the savage beast,
right? Nice try, Marriott, but putting a band in
the C-Side cafeteria at noon to placate the
Coney Island—size line of students trying to get
in and get fed doesn’t even begin to solve the
problems with Pitt’s food service. (By the way,
staffing that other, unused register only takes
one person, the band took four.)

Ahh, you’ve got to love the wonderful
environment of the academic world. Have you
ever had that Monday exam that you wanted
to study for Sunday morning or even that
Saturday morning class? I’m sure you woke
up, took a nice shower, grabbed your bookbag,
and ambled on down to grab an early weekend
breakfast? No? OK, maybe not an early break-
fast, how about a 9:00 breakfast? 10:(X)!?! Oh,
that’s right: Marriott doesn’t even open before

11:00 a.m. on the weekends. What an incen-

LEITER: Meet capitalism's

Along with noted author and political
analyst Michael Parenti, I think a more
appropriate term for the Central Intelligence
Agency is Capitalism’s International Army
or Cocaine Import Agency.

The CIA has been very successful at
keeping the poor of other countries in line
with death squads, torture, and proxy armies,
and the poor ofthe United States under con-
trolwithdrugs.ThemainpurposeoftheCIA
is not intelligence, but protecting and
enhancing corporate power and global capi-
talism.

When the CIA receives adverse publici-

as either a rogue agency or a bumbling

is neither! It is an extremely successful
agency for its mission, which is to keep the

Thank you Pitt and thank you Marriott for
making our lives so much better.

Marriott has successfully established its
own starvation canrp monopoly here on our
campus. Assuming that you have the largest
available block plan offered, 14 blocks per
week at the “paltry” cost of $975.00 per
semester (the catch here is that if you don’t use
the 14 between Monday morning and Sunday
ni t, well  you guessed it: you lose them),
and you budget well, you can only eat twice a
day. The next largest, nmning in at $950 gives
you 180 blocks to spend at your own leisure,
or until the end of the semester when you have
to call home to avoid starving during exams.

If you don’t walk over to the C-side “all
you can eat” cafeteria or hike up to Sutherland
Hall, you have a budget of $4.50 to buy your
satisfying meal with. Great Now, isn’t it frrnny
how you walk to the register with a sandwich
and a Coke and there's always that 40 cents
you always seem to have left on your block?
Stranger yet is that there is nothing in any
Marriott facility for less than 60 cents.

Coincidence? I think not.

Let’s take that 40 cents, hell, we’ll make
it 35 cents to give Marriott a chance here, mul-
tiply it by the 16,721 undergrad students
(minus the oﬂ"—campus students, students who
use the “all you can eat option,” and students
who choose not to buy a meal plan, let’s say. ..
8,721) and we see that Marriott makes $2,800
a day. This doesn’t include the students who
exercise the option of not even eating on cam-
pus that day or simply wasting a block to cover
that 45 cents they ran over their $4.50 limit.
While these satisfying meals may be nice for
Kate Moss, they aren’t that nice for young,
active college students.

Nowhere else in my entire life have I ever
corrre across a 75—cent bag of chips so small,
and that includes Three Rivers Stadium, the

they aren’t, then why don’t they get off carn-

THE PI'I"l' NEWS

Joe Pa’s not impressed with The Pitt News Sports Briefing

{from local and wire services

Entertainment

- Former sports star Bo Jackson made
his acting debut in the new John
Grisham movie The Chamber.

Jackson said the transition to acting
was not nearly as difficult as his decision
to leave the sports world. The decision
was made easier when Jackson’s son
complained that his dad was never home.
Baseball
- The American League champion New
York Yankees continue their World
Series preparations at home. Darryl
Strawberry’s big toe is the main topic of
conversation. He fouled a pitch off his
right foot in the Yankees’ ﬁnal game of
their playoff series with Baltimore. A sec-
ond x—ray yesterday revealed a small
crack in the bone of his big toe. An initial
x—ray was negative.

Strawberry says the injury will not

keep him from playing when the World
Series begins Saturday night.
- Baltimore Orioles’ manager Davey
Johnson is being elusive about his return
next season. Johnson offered no com-
ment when asked if he would return, say-
ing only that he was under contract.

An unnamed Orioles’ source quoted
in the story says team owner Peter
Angelos has no plans to fire Johnson, but
would not keep him from leaving.
Angelos is reportedly angry over com-
ments Johnson made during the season
and about some of his managerial deci-
sions during the playoffs.

Basketball

- Shawn Kemp’s return to the Seattle
SuperSonics will be within a week
according to a newspaper article. The
Seattle Times reported that Kemp told a
friend after a meeting with team owner
Barry Ackerley that he’ll rejoin the team
within a week. Team President Wally
Walker said he has no indication that
Kemp will return and that no timetable
has been set.

Kemp has missed the first 15 days of
training camp and did not accompany the
team on its current trip to Europe. Kemp
wants to renegotiate his contract.

- A referee with three years’ experience
officiating girls’ junior varsity basketball
games is suing the PIAA and the Del Val
Athletic Association in federal court in
Philadelphia. Noreen Kemether says
she wants to ref boys’ high school bas-
ketball, but she was told by the man in
charge of assignments that “girls don’t do
boys games.”

- Allegheny County, city officials, and

the Pittsburgh Penguins reportedly have
agreed in principle on how to pay for
$10.5 million in improvements to the
Civic Arena, the NHL’s second oldest
arena. Penguin lawyer Chuck
Greenberg says negotiators hope to pre-
sent a deal to Mayor Tom Murphy by the
end of the week.

Football

° Former Philadelphia Eagle Keith
Byars is back in the NFL after signing
with the New England Patriots The veter~
an tight end/fullback was released by
Miami two months ago. Byars has at
least 50 receptions in seven of his last
eight seasons.

0 Pittsburgh Steelers’ Coach Bill Cowher
says Tom Myslinski will start at right

guard for the injured Brendan Stai in
Houston on Sunday. Myslinski had not
played since training camp and was cut
late in the preseason, but later resigned
with Pittsburgh. Stai will miss four to six
weeks with an elbow injury that will
require surgery today.

- Penn State’s Joe Paterno says he has
changed his mind about the Nittany
Lions’ offense after watching game tapes.
Immediately after the Lions’ 31-14 victo-
ry Saturday over Purdue, Paterno said his
team was not very good and would strug-

gle if it didn’t improve. But now Joe Pa.

thinks they’re pretty good.

N'l'l5'l' ON CAMPUS

Vinces Blue Plate Specials

 

With an oﬂ° week for the Pitt Panthers,
this writer’s thoughts tum to the future of the
program and what needs to be done to get it
back to where it belongs — among the
nation’s elite. There is no doubt that John
Majors was one of the greatest coaches in
college football, and Pitt will be forever
gratefulthathe rescued the programin 1973.
But it’s equally clear that, despite a stellar
recruiting class last year and fabulous
improvements to the football facilities, the
team is not as good as it was four years ago.
There’s no truth to the rumor that Pitt is pro-
ducing a commemorative video entitled,
“Paul Hackett: The Golden Years,” but it is
true that there’s no way this team is 72 points
less talented than Ohio State or 48 points
less talented than Syracuse. Majors should,
and will, resign at the end of the year.

The task of rescuing the program now
falls to Chancellor Nordenberg and the
soon-to-be—narned athletic director. Pitt and
Oval Jaynes blundered badly in 1992 by
waiting until mid-December to hire Majors,
because it wasn’t until mid-January that
Majors was able to assemble a staff and hit
theroadrecruiting.Asaresult, wegotapoor
class and are now paying for it. The new
coach must be named by the end of
November, and no expense should be
spared in luring a top coaching prospect. In
1981, Texas A&M raped and pillaged Pitt
by luring away Jackie Sherrill with a $1 mil-
lion contract. Pitt must now do the same.

The students, faculty, alumni, and fans
deserve better than the raw deal they’ve
been getting from the University administra-
tion over the last 10 years. Pitt is a school
that should never lose more than two or
three games in a given year and should chal-
lenge for the national championship every
five years. lt’s time for Pitt to do it right.

Georgia Tech (4-1) at Clemson (3-3)
— If you thought Pitt got blown out by Ohio
State, how about this score: Georgia Tech
222, Cumberland College 0. It actually hap-
pened, back in the Paleolithic Era of college
football. Clemson should fare a little better.
Georgia Tech 17, Clemson 10.

Auburn (5-1) at Florida (6-0) -- Last
week, I was dead sure that Ohio State was
the best team in the land. After Florida’s
destruction of LSU last week. I’m not so
sure. The Gators romp in The Swamp and
ﬂog in the bog. Florida 49, Auburn 14.

West Virginia (6-0) at Temple (1-5)
—- Plenty of good seats are still available in
the Vet. West Virginia 31, Temple 0.

Arkansas (2-3) at South Carolina (3-
3) — What has happened to Bill Clinton’s
adopted alrna mater, which won the SEC
West last year? In the spirit of Clinton’s

impending rout in November, which is just
as scientiﬁc a reason to pick an upset as any,
I go with the Hogs. First Blue Plate Upset
Special: Arkansas 26, South Carolina 19.

Northwestern (5-1) at Wisconsin (3-
2) — The ﬁrst Rose Bore—tiebreaker in the
Big 10 is best overall record, which means if
both Ohio State and Northwestern win the
rest of their games, Ohio State goes to
Pasadena. The Badgers have just played
Penn State and Ohio State on consecutive
weekends, and no team can be “up” for
three weeks in a row. Nevertheless,
Wisconsin prevails. Wisconsin 27,
Northwestern 21.

Mississippi (3-2) at Alabama (6-0) —
The Tide is the least impressive undefeated
team in the country, having only beaten
Bowling Green by 14, Vanderbilt by 10, and
most recently, N.C. State by 5. Alabama’s
ﬁrst real test comes Oct. 26 at Termessee,
where a win would make them one of the
favorites for the national title. Alabama 13,
1‘ I. . .ppi 0.

Iowa State (2-3) at Oklahoma State
(3-3) — This is the only remaining game for
the Cyclones where they don’t ﬁgure to be a
heavy underdog, which could mean a repeat
of last season, when Troy Davis rushed for
2,000 yards but Iowa State still managed
onlya3-8 record Itwillbeinterestingtosee
ifthe Heisman voters are willing to deny a
2,000-yard rusher for a second year in a row.
Iowa State 36, Oklahoma State 35.

Kentucky (1-5) at LSU (4-1) — One
rumor has Lou Holtz leaving Notre Dame
for the Oakland Raiders, with LSU Coach
Gerry DiNardo taking over in South Bend.
Why Holtz would want to work with so
much less talent, and lower player payroll,
I’m not sure. LSU 41, Kentucky 7.

USC (4-2) at Arizona State (6-0) -
Even considering their big win over
Nebraska, I’m not yet convinced that the
Pac-10 has a top ﬁve team. Having unsuc-
cessfully picked the Sun Devils to be upset
last week, I’m going to the well one more
time. Second Blue Plate Upset Special:
USC 21, Arizona State 17.

Guest Pick of the Week, Head Coach
Neil Gordon, Penn Hills High School: Air
Force (3-2) at Notre Dame (4-1) — If you
think that high school football in Western
Pennsylvania isn’t tough, how about this:
Gordon‘s Indians are the number—one team
in America according to USA Today, but
they’re only number two in the WPIAL
according to Metro Index Scouting, which
has North Allegheny at number one. Penn
Hills also has been a pipeline to Pitt over the
years, sending such greats as Tom Flynn,
Bill Fralic, and Tom Tumulty down the
Parkway to Oakland. Current Penn Hills
products on the Panthers’ roster are 300-
pound linemen Bill Craver and Demond
Gibson. Notre Dame 42, Air F oree 6.

Last week 3-5 (38%); overall 29-15
(66%); guest picks overall 3-2 (60%);
upsets overall 4-6 (40)%.

Horse racing is perverted, even though I

Who can forget about Michigan? Year

shots around, they could be booking a trip to
the Final Four in March.

This is just a small sample of the excite-

Jonathan Richman, the hardorking person in showbiz, will stop by

Rosebud this Tuesday. Watch him delight the audience with his lovely songs.

 Hxgscene

Jonathan Richman has been
performing his songs in public
since he was 16 years old, way
back in 1967. He formed his
band the Modern Lovers in 1970
(with David Robinson of the
Cars on drums). Since then, he
has not stopped touring either by
himself or with a band for more
than two months at a time.
Maybe you’re already familiar
with his work. If you’re not,
there's a good chance you’ve
heard at least one of his songs
before.

Ever see the movie Repo Man
? Remember the song “Pablo
Picasso (Was Never Called An
Asshole)”? That’s Jonathan. His
song “Roadrunner” was covered
by Joan Jett and the Sex Pistols
back in the ‘70s, and his song
“I’m a Little Airplane” is regu-
larly featured on Sesame Street.
He also has been the “most fre-
quent guest" on “Late Night
With Conan O'Brien.”

The man is truly a PUNK
ROCK legend, and the best thing
about him is the fact that some of
his songs are so feel-good that
they can make you ill if you
aren’t ready for it. He has been
an influence on countless under-

ground and mainstream musi-
cians, and music lovers in gener-
al. I would compare his ultra-
personal lyrical style with Half
Japanese’s Jad Fair and local hit-
maker Scott Prairie (of
Hopefools and 7 Goats).
Musically, his style has changed
with every album and tour. Folk,
soul, country, and punk are
among the genres conquered thus
far by Richman in his extensive
career.

His 21st album, Surrender to
Jonathan, is out on the brand

new label Vapor Records, and he‘

will be playing at Rosebud this
Tuesday in one of his 140 shows
before the end of the year. He
drives himself to every gig. This
truly is one of the hardest work-
ing people in showbiz, and he
loves what he does. He has been
quoted as saying that he
promised himself that he would
quit the minute it felt like work.
He hasn’t quit yet.

A ollywod film

  

Italians with no moiioso?!!

Big Night

Starring Stanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub,
Isabella Rosellini

Directed by Stanley Tucci and Campbell
Scott

Big Night tells the story of two Italian
brothers trying to make it as restauranteurs
in America.It is a simple little story that is
big on heart.

Prime and Secondo Pilaggi own a
restaurant called “The Paradise.” Primo
(Shalhoub) is the cook. Secondo (Tucci) is
the manager and host. The movie starts
with Secondo ﬁnding out the bank is going
to foreclose on their loan if the restaurant
doesn’t start to make money. When talking
it over with his brother, Secondo realizes
his brother is going to be against any
changes that need to be made.

Prirno believes his cooking should
stand alone. He thinks that people should
come into his restaurant because the food
is excellent and worth the price, even if it
is a bit high (which, if looks mean any-
thing, no price would be too high for this
food). Secondo, on the other ,

i 3

Pascal has set the date.

The second half of the ﬁlm is about
the preparation that is involved in setting
up this dinner and showing the party itself.

In preparation for the party, Secondo
has to almost empty their savings account
just to buy the food. For the booze, he
makes a call to Pascal’s wife (Rosellini).
This call involves a little more than just
asking nicely. During this entire process,
Secondo breaks up with his girlfriend, gets
back together with her, then breaks up
again. None of which is because of his
affair with Pascal's wife. Prime, on the
other hand, gets too nervous around
women to even invite the woman he is
interested in, so Secondo has to match-
make for him.

All kinds of little twists are thrown
into the story to make it engrossing as well
as extremely enjoyable. The relationship
between the brothers is explored through-
out the ﬁlm, but enough characters, and I
do mean characters, are thrown into the
mix to spice it up.

It might seem amazing in this day and

, age, but there are no

hand, thinks they should do   ‘,3 1;} V I e W maﬁoso in this ﬁlm. Some

something similar to the

restaurant “Pascal’s” across the street. He
thinks they should cater to the American
taste buds, not force certain tastes on them.
“Pascal's” is always busy, always teeming
with people. Secondo thinks they must be
doing something right. “Rape!” is what
Primo calls what they are doing to the
food. He treats his ancestors’ cooking like
a mother treats a child, and will not com-
promise himself or the food.

Secondo happens to be friends with
the owner of “Pascal’s” (Ian Holm) and
asks him for help with their loan. Pascal
refuses to give money but oﬁers to help
bring in more guests. He assures Secondo
that the popular Italian singer, Louis
Prima, will come and eat in his restaurant
whenheisintown.Pascalassureshimtlmt
Primaisafriendandeverythingwillbeset
up.

Secondo loves the idea of a famous
singer, and hopefully his followers, oom-
ing to his restaurant, but isn't sure Primo
will be receptive to help from Pascal.
Primo, being a consummate chef, hates
Pascal for serving the food he does.
Secondo decides not to tell Primo that

are hinted at, but none glori-
ﬁed like in most. The thing this ﬁlm has in
common with the rest of the Italian-
American ﬁlms in recent years is the
prevalence of food. And lots and lots of
food. There is so much delicious food in
this ﬁlm, there is even a cookbook forth-
coming. Don’t see this ﬁlm on anything
less than a full stomach.

T‘wo primarily television actors handle
the ﬁlm like experts. Tucci especially, with
co-writing and co-directing credits, shows
hecanhandlehirnselfintheﬁlmbusiness.
Shalhoub contains himself, unlike his
incredibly quirky character on “Wings.”
He shows us he can be funny, but doesn’t
have to go over the top. His is a ditﬁcult
character because he is at once the irra-
tionalbrotherandtheolderbrotherwho
lcnowswhatisgoodforthebothofthem.
Shalhoub pulls it off.

The last scene of the ﬁlm rivals open-
ing shots suchasthosein ThePlayerand
Persuasion. A seemingly 10 minute long,
uncut shot shows us the unchangeable
relationship between the brothers. The ﬁlm
doesn’t let us forget what it is really about.

Manifold Splendour~—~ look for the
name on the radio and MTV within the
next year. In the meantime, catch one of
their upcoming shows:
°Friday, Oct. l8, 9:30 pm at The Attic
(21+)
°Saturday, Oct. [9, 8:00 pm at Chatham
College coffeehouse (all ages)

This band has been working together
for only three months, yet they’ve pro-
duced 20 songs and a more cohesive
sound than many established, chart—top—
ping bands. They have a layered, “mod,”
brit—pop sound, like Sloan or Superdrag.
Two vocalists collaborate to create well-
blended harmonies any Beatles fan will
appreciate. People who don’t like pop
music will still enjoy Manifold Splendour
shows— I’ve seen it happen before.

Singer/rhythm guitarist (and Pitt stu-
dent?!) Emily Bome’s voice is eminently
suited to this kind of music -— it‘s not
obnoxious or forceful like that of Small
Factory’s female vocalist, yet it contains
none of the wavering breathiness that
characterizes less structured genres of
songwriting. She manages trippiness with
the detachment and clarity of Madder
Rose’s Mary Lorson, adding a brightness
all her own which makes the songs irre-
sistible. The singing of co—vocalist and
lead guitar player Alex Brenner is sincere
and raw. with the freshness of a disillu-
sioned little kid. The two harmonize ﬂaw—

Thursday, October 1 7, I996

 

lessly without overpowering one another,
and the blend is blissfully intoxicating. In
addition, Brenner adds expert guitar play—
ing, including skilled, tuneful, compactly
melodic solos, and the fastest strumming I
have ever witnessed. The other three band
members are equally noteworthy. The
playing of bassist Mike Mancini meshes
seamlessly with the band’s three guitars,
going beyond creating the music’s back—
bone to spice it up with good ﬁlls and
overall interesting playing. Drummer
Sean Finn’s finesse in negotiating time
changes and adding ﬁlls at pivotal points
reminds me of ex—Smashing Pumpkins’
drumming genius Jimmy Chamberlain.
Finally, Craig Svitek fills in the spot that
Kurt Cobain always wished for, hiding in
the comer on rhythrn/sometimes lead gui-
tar. Craig appears very modest about his
position in this band, but Manifold
Splendour‘s signature sound depends on
the use of at least two guitars at all times,
so don’t let his shyness fool you — he
deserves as much credit as everyone else.

When you hear one of this band’s
catchy songs on the radio a few months
down the road, don’t be the one who
regrets not going to see their amazing,
dance—entrancing show. Be sure to catch
them soon, or you won’t be able to say, “I
saw them at a club,“ when they’re playing
Starlake!

Amidst the eclectic collection of
hardly-known galleries in Pittsburgh,
two dedicate themselves to the exhibi-
tion of photography. Many artists and
art—goers are acquainted with
Pittsburgh Filmmakers in North
Oakland because of classes they might
take there or the movies they see there,
but few are aware of the exhibition
space that Filmmakers hides on the sec-
ond tloor. In another part of town is
Silver Eye Center for Photography.
This organization not only exhibits pho-
tography, but it also provides programs
for the photographer. Currently there are
two very worthwhile exhibits at these
galleries which you probably didn’t
know about until now, so the following
includes more information and further
persuasion to get you out of your dorm
room/living room.

At Filmmakers’ gallery (a.k.a.
Melwood Photography Gallery) is
one of the most broadly represented
photographic shows you will ever see.
Until Nov. 16 the space is devoted to
Pittsburgh Filmmakers ’ Members ’
Show, a periodic event that showcases
Filmmakers’ members. The amateur
photographers in this show have all
interpreted the medium in very different
ways, and the works exhibited illustrate
the wide variety of processes
Filmmakers offers to those who utilize
their facilities. Traditional black and
white photographs are hung with color

. THE PI'l"I' NEWS

and non—silver prints. A huge painterly
color photograph shown is reminiscent
of a canvas in its size and presentation.
Meanwhile a group of much smaller 4 x
5-inch Polaroids that are attached to
empty Polaroid cartridges refer to their
own origin in their unique framing. A
three dimensional interpretation of the
medium is also assessed in a piece that
incorporates text, a wooden box, and a
plastic doll. It is very worthwhile for
anyone interested in understanding the
possibilities of the medium to go and see
this show.

Once you have seen the Members’
Show, you can head over to the South
Side to Silver Eye gallery to see a more
traditional group of work. The term “tra-
ditional” may also be misleading in this
exhibition because although the work
consists of a series of black and white
prints, this group of photographs were
taken by children. The artist Wendy
Ewald initiated this photo project enti-
tled Retratos y Suenosl Portraits and
Dreams: Photographs by Mexican
Children. Ewald, who has taught chil-
dren around the world, worked with ele-
mentary school children in Chiapas,
Mexico for three months. These stu-
dents, who set out to record their envi-
romnent with cameras, ended up with an
interesting document of the Tzotil
Indians and descendants of Spaniards
that have a history in Mexico dating to
the 1520s. In addition to these images

that give insight into the point of view of
children, the creative writings of these
students are presented as part of this pro-

ject. Together these elements thoroughly

express the thoughts of a group of chil-
dren that live in a very different world.

One other thing to catch at Silver
Eye is Cafe Silver Eye. Every third
Friday Silver Eye hosts this infomral
gathering of artists and photographers. It
is an opportunity for artists to gather and
share their work and experiences. This
month on the 18th, Cafe Silver Eye will
present “Magazine and Documentary
Photography” hosted by Lynn Johnson,
a well known Black Star Photo Agency
photographer. Johnson, whose work has
appeared in TIME, Newsweek, Life,
Forbes, and Business Week, will share
her experiences from taking pho-
tographs for 22 years and will also
review any portfolios or work.

You may not be an aspiring com-
mercial photographer, but all of these
events are free so your excuses are lim-
ited. If you have to pick one, go to
Filmmakers; it’s closer and you can
catch a movie afterwards. The Melwood
Photography Gallery is located at 471
Melwood Ave. and the hours are Mon.-
Fri. ]2—5pm and Sat. 10—2pm (681 —
5449). Silver Eye is at 1015 East Carson
St. and hours are I2—5pm Mon. -Sat.
(431-1810).

Two weeks ago. In Pittsburgh made
another attempt at their Women in Rock "fea-
ture story due to a huge inﬂux of critical letters

responding to their first article. They got it .
' wrong again, though, because IP has failed to
recognize a fundamental fact that will foil.

every attempt they make at compiling these
lists: THERE ARE NO WOMEN IN ROCK
IN PITTSBURGH.

Feminists continuously serve unintention-
al blows to their own cause when they set out
to put women heroes who don’t exist in the
spotlight. In this case. a list of mediocre musi-
cians was used to supposedly prove that there
are women who can rock out there. they just
don‘t get the publicity that men get. The reason
why women in bands in Pittsburgh don’t get

any attention is because they don’t deserve it.

To understand how masochistic this campaign
to show off female rockers is, envision a list of
the top four male rock musicians in town and
compare it to IP's list of women. —

This spotlight on women in rock has
undermined the initial goal to celebrate these
musicians, and instead has brought to the sur-
face a severe deﬁcit in the pool of rock artists.
Little girls play the ﬂute, not the guitar. Here is
where stereotypes begin. and to put some girls
on the cover of a magazine because of their
gender. not their musical ability only rein-
forces this system.

Bette an ’t make your life better
Lilys ’
Che Records

The Lilys have come a long way
from being dubbed a My Bloody
Valentine ripoff band. But if you’re
like me and you disregarded this label
(nothing wrong with sounding like
MBV) you may have spent your time
and money well following this band’s
releases. In the Presence of Nothing
earned the Lilys their MBV compari-
son early on, but it also introduced
their penchant for complex and textur-
al melodies and pretty vocals. Their
next release, A Brief History of
Amazing Letdowns, was a sharp diver-
sion from «the thick, blurry “epics” on
In the Presence. Instead, this album
made the melodies clearer, the vocals
a little louder, and made the songs
more rocking. Their hit “Ginger” from
this period was a perfect mix of an
addictive pop song and the complex
weaving of melodies that the Lilys
have mastered. After these albums
came something that would elevate
this Philly band to monumental status:
Eccsame the Photoband.

For anyone who hasn’t heard this
album, which came out in ‘94 on
spinART, do yourself a favor and go
get it. On this record, the Lilys
returned to their epic songwriting,
exemplified on In the Presence, but
here they set forth their own sound.
Kurt Heasly, the mastermind behind
the band, orchestrated the production
of this album with bandmate Rich
Costley and created lush sounds with
mysterious origins. Despite the heavy
texture of melodies, the songs are
crisp and clear, not weighed down by
overproduction.

Then fans eagerly awaited another
Lily release until last spring, when an
interesting 7” came out on Che.
Maybe the Lilys got so fed up with
comparisons that they decided to give
people a real reason to compare, or
maybe they just wanted to do some-
thing fun, but this time the Lilys real-
ly changed their sound. The two songs
from this 7” (Returns Every Morning)
could have been put out 30 years ago.
They are genre songs, perfectly mim-
icking the sounds of late Beatles or the

Thursday, October I 7, I996

 
      

Kinks. So, what are we to think of
this?

These two songs are actually real-
ly great songs. Once again, the Lilys’
good taste in what to copy justifies
this imitation, especially if it’s just for
two songs. But then last month in New
York, the Lilys appeared on stage at
CMJ announcing their new look and
sound. All suited up and looking as
tight as they sounded, the Lilys played
their new songs from Better can ’t
make your life better, an extension of
the sound introduced on the 7”. The
songs are fast, upbeat and the vocals
are mixed at an all time high for
Heasley. Although the sound is retro-
spective, the Lilys redeem themselves
by nailing it perfectly. Sometimes a
song will really hit the spot, like
“Returns Every Morning,” which
exemplifies the Lilys’ mastery of
structural song writing. Others,
though, initially sound too much like a
‘60s sitcom theme song or a track
from The Wonder Years. This is most
likely a superficial assessment,
though, because Lilys’ songs have
always proved to get better the more
you listen to them. It is possible that
this applies to this album because the
sound they have created is not a sim-
ple one to master, and the good song
writing, well-done vocals, and tight
instrumentation that the Lilys have
always possessed is still there.

If you have a chance and you are
lucky enough to find it, get the 7” first
and, if you ﬁnd yourself obsessed
with this sound, then go get Better
can ’t make your life better. You might
also already have a Kinks craving that
needs to be appeased with something
new, in which case this is the album
for you. But even if none of this
sounds like your kind of thing, go and
see the Lilys live if you ever have a
chance. They are one band that will
still blow you away on stage.

Les Claypool and the Holy
Mackerel
Highball with the Devil

Interscope/Prawn Song

Les Claypool wants to make sure
his current project, Les Claypool and
the Holy Mackerel presents High Ball
with the Devil, is not confused with
his work on Primus.

“Well,” he says in his press
release, “all I can say is it’s not
Primus.”

Okay, then maybe it could best be
described as Primus Lite, or Primus
Red, or Primus Ice  you get the
point. It may have a bit of a different
taste, but it is still an awful lot like the
original.

As much as Claypool may wish to

Thursday, Oclober ‘I 7, ‘I996

differentiate this work from Primus,
he cannot. Les Claypool is Primus, as
much as John Lennon was the Beatles
or Jerry Garcia was the Grateful Dead.
He spreads his influence over the band
so much that his solo work is automat-
ically going to be grouped alongside
them.

Even though the idea for this
album came from some of Claypool’s
old private knickknacks that were lay-
ing about, most of the tracks were
actually recorded during the past year.
This CD is not just made up from lit-
tle tidbits that Claypool had scooped
up from his pre—Primus days. Once the
inﬂuence is there, though, it is hard to
shake, whether it is realized or not -
and there is a lot of Primus inﬂuence.

Of course, this is Les Claypool
and the Holy Mackerel, not just Les
Claypool. You are not supposed to
think it is a solo project, but really it
is. Sure, Claypool gets a lot of help
from some talented musicians, but it is
his vision that drives the album. He
wrote almost all of the songs and
plays many of the instruments.

The only consistent musician,
besides Claypool himself, is Mark
“Mirv” Haggard, who plays guitar on
six of the cd’s 15 tracks. He also plays
an electric-bowed handsaw, one of the
most unusual instruments on the
album.

Along with Haggard,’Claypool is
joined by a parade of great musicians,
including Jay Lane (the drummer from
Sausage), Joe Gore (guitarist for Tom
Waits and PJ Harvey), Charlie Hunter,
and Henry Rollins.

The album itself is a conglomera-
tion of Primus-like tunes. The first
track, “Running the Gauntlet,” sounds
like it could have been taken from
Sailing the Seas of Cheese. “Holy
Mackerel,” the second track, takes
more from harder albums like Suck on
This or F rizzle Fry. The whole thing
wraps up with “Carolina Rig,” a nifty
little instrumental groove, with a fish-
ing TV show laid over the top. The
theme of fishing has been seen before
throughout Primus lore.

The same nasal voice and slappy
bass lines that separate Primus from
the norm remain in the forefront of
High Ball with. the Devil. Also includ-
ed is Claypool’s wacky sense of
humor, as evidenced on “Granny’s
Little Yard Gnome.”

“Content to stand alone,” he sings;
“Waiting, watching, guarding
Granny’s house/His face reflecting
simple joy/But he is not a happy plas-
ter boy.”

This is not to say that Claypool is
not trying anything new here. “Me and
Chuck” is an interesting departure for
Les, with a heavy funk inﬂuence.
Likewise, “The Awakening” is a cover
of a little known tune by Otis

TI-IE PITT NEWS

 

Redding’s son Dexter with an interest-
ing, jazzy feel. “Delicate Tendrils”
features Henry Rollins performing a
spoken word segment over a classic
Claypool bass line.

Besides being one of the longest
album names of all time, Les Claypool
and the Holy Mackerel presents High
Ball with the Devil is a great interlude
for those waiting for the next Primus
album. There is nothing that will real-
ly blow the regular Primus fan out of
the water. However, it does have some
catchy tunes that are less filling, but
taste great.

KMFDM
Xtort
Wax Trax!/TVT

What is KMFDM?

That’s an interesting question. To
tell the truth, KMFDM is somewhat of
a enigma. It is hard to say what exact-
ly KMFDM is. Is it industrial? It is
alternative? Is it dance? What exactly
are they striving for?

Many people have spent many a
year trying to determine what exactly
they are. This even includes the fact
that no one quite knows what the
KMFDM moniker even means. Due to
people spreading disinformation
(myself included), the general consen-
sus was that KMFDM stood for “Kill
M.F.’ing Depeche Mode.” That is all
well and good, and may fit KMFDM’s
attitude, but I recently found this to be
incorrect.

Well, thanks to my adept skill at
investigative reporting (okay, so I
looked at the KMFDM web page), I
can now give a definitive answer.
KMFDM stands for “Kein Mehrheit
Fur Die Mitleid,” which is a German
phrase meaning “No Pity For The
Majority.” I guess NPFTM didn’t
sound as good.

Basically, KMFDM’s purpose is
to question what society has tradition-
ally governed as “normal.” They ques-
tion government, culture, attitudes and
almost anything else they can get their
grubby little mitts on.

But let’s get to the point: What
kind of music does KMFDM play?

If the new album, Xtort is any
indication, most people would jump
up and say “Industrial!” However, it’s
a bit more complex than that. The
songs “Craze” and “Blame” both fea-
ture horns prominently — sounding a
lot like something from a Morphine
album. Tracks like “Power,” the first
single, exude a techno/dance feel.
“Dogma” is a spoken word track
backed by banging percussion and
synthesized loops. It may be industri-
al, but it is also inﬂuenced by other

GUNTHER SPEAKS...

about art, money, and
ultimately  himself

Money is pure evil, but that doesn’t
mean I/we shouldn’t want and need it.
When I was a junkie I wanted DOPE.
DOPE is and was pure evil (that’s anoth-
er story though). But still I needed it to
be happy and to survive. What I am try-
ing to say to ya’ll is that we are all
junkies when it comes to money. Don’t
worry folks, this does have an artistic
swing-a-swang to it.

Money makes the world go ‘round,
and more importantly, it feeds, clothes,
and drunks ya. Work seems like the sim-
ple solution for a healthy person who
needs money to live a decent life.
Certainly to you that does make
CENTS. But you must remember that
the artistic soul is not a healthy one, and,
arguably, neither is the artist a healthy
person.

The artist is an ordinary cripple. Not
a cripple in the ordi-
nary sense, but
instead crippled
when it comes to
being ordinary.
Artists tend to hallu-
cinate when given an
ordinary tool. (at this
moment I am seeing 
so much sexuality in ii
a hammer). To an -
artist the simple task .
of makin’ an Arch-
Deluxe becomes a i
symbol for the main-
stream’s power to force vegetarians to
live in a meat-eater’s crue1—small—cow-
torturing—world. As you may under-
stand, the artist cannot operate in a sim-
ple, plain man’s pleasant manner in a
crazy, distracting work environment.

Thus, the artist tends to hide himself
in his studio (if funds permit such a lux-
ury) or whatever hole he tends to best be
able to transform the distractions around
him into art. If he is good at it, then he is
considered a genius who doesn’t need to
work. For he must, at all times, be able
to create when the mind deems it neces-

sary; however, if he is less than great or
sucks, then he is a lazy loser wasting his
time with a hobby instead of going out
and making himself useful. The latter is
usually what most of the incredibly
great minds in art—history were consid-
ered (such as the partially earless Van
Gogh).

My point is this: an artist knows if
he is an artist, even if he really seems to
suck badly like Zak Shuman of CMU-
ART/Bumpy Toast fame (who is well-
known for saying “this piece of art was
supposed to do this, but...”). If one feels
compelled to be creative over all else
unless tempted with sex or drugs, then

  

he should be able to do so just as a
woman in labor should be allowed to
give birth when SHE feels it is neces-
sary.
And if an artist should be able to
live this creative life of lives then he will
need money to do so, not because he
wants to be rich, but because he must be
able to eat, have shelter, get drunk-ass-
wasted—till—falling-down—or—breaking—
shit, and to impress folks by putting
really expensive items in his art and
wasting them. We as a society need
these artists as much as we need hook-
ers, strippers, pom-stars, and Taco Bell
employees. Therefore, they need your
support and. more importantly, your
money, if you are rich.

So, if you are rich, I am an artist. All
my life I have been creating art that
makes people say “oh” and writing
words that make
folks say “holy shit,
that’s the best god-
damn thing I ever
heard!” (I’m trying
to say that I write,
which I am great at,
and I paint, which I
am not so great at.)
So, I need your cash,
and a lot of it. (I like
to smoke expensive
French cigarettes and
drink Johnny Walker
packs and a bottle a day.) To keep this
creative soul making America proud and
happy, please, send all the cash you can
spare and then some to P.O.Box 1362,
Monroeville, PA 15146  as soon as
you get home and ﬁnd your checkbook.

I am down to my last ﬁve cigarettes,
I only have three bucks, no scotch here,
I need a couple of new cds, I also need a
steak or two, I’d like to go out tonight
and drink Guiness Stout and watch jazz
if possible, and the heels of my
HushPuppies are wearing thin. So,
please, as you can surely see, I need
your money badly to keep up the great
output of artistic energy, so that society
can stay balanced. If you can’t do it for
me then do it for my girlfriend (she has
expensive taste and I can’t say no!).

Please, ﬁnd it in your large green
heart to send me more than you can real-
ly afford because if you think about it,
you and your children can do without
for a few days for art’s sake. Really,
Sir/Ma’am, I am jokingly serious and
honestly middle-class—poor. I need you.
NO! ART needs YOU! (remember:
MONEY HELPS ART MOST!)

Why am I telling you to go see Porno
For Pyros this Saturday night? It’s got all the
elements of the type of show that I ordinari-
ly would try to dissuade people from paying
to see (corporate so—called ALTERNATIVE
ROCK, $23 tickets, an egotistic singer, fash-
ionable gear, It Comes From L.A., etc... )
The thing is, like many other kids from my
generation, I’ve seen Perry Farrell perform
live before, and I remember how great I felt
inside after seeing Jane’s Addiction (and
even Porno For Pyros, whose ﬁrst album I
detested) when I was younger.

Their second album, Good God is Urge,
is a million times better than the ﬁrst one, and
though I don’t listen to it all the time, I would
love to see the band play the songs in such an
“intimate” (of course everything is relative)
setting as the Metropol. You see, Farrell is
one of the only .rock stars I can think of who
is so completely full of shit that he’s believ-
able. You can tell that he believes himself,
and that’s enough for me to put some faith in
the guy. Indie politics aside (and I probably
listen to just as much corporate stuff as indie

THE PITT NEWS

stuﬂ’, it’s just that most of the corporate stuff
I listen to is from the ‘70s), when I’m old (if
I’m ever old) I’ll be proud to tell the other
kids at the rest home that I once saw Perry
Farrell do his thing. He’s very good at it.

Supposedly, Mike Watt is their full—time
bass player now, but I don’t believe it. I just
can’t imagine Watt kickin’ around with
Farrell and Co. for more than a couple shows
before getting armoyed at all their outlandish
get—ups and whatnot. I’m sure all the music
will be very professional, no matter who’s
playing.

So, if you’ve never seen the man/the
band, and just got a big fat cash settlement

from that bad batch of Manic Panic hair dye .

you bought, or some birthday money, or for
some reason are feeling particularly wealthy,
I would suggest you go see Porno For Pyros
and that shitty band that’s opening up for
them on Saturday.

Porno For Pyros and Fun Lovin’
Criminals will play at Metmpol this
Saturday, Oct. 16 at 7:30 p.m. All ages.

alternative psychedelia ain’t your cup of tea,
perhaps you’d rather go to Tobacco
Roadhouse for the Mods and Rockers
Weekend Showcase, where Cleveland’s Ace

Pittsburgh’s own rockabilly champs

band, the B-3’s. Tobacco Roadhouse would

San Francisco’s Tribe 8 are some
badass punk rockers who happen to be les-
bians. What does that have to do with their
music? Everything.

This band has got the type of attitude
that can only come from being a rnarginal—
ized member of society, and since punkers
aren’t exactly marginalized anymore, being
gay can sure come in handy, if you’re a punk
rocker looking for some lyrical inspiration,

that is. These chicks were invited to hang out
on a cruise -ship with Luther Campbell, of 2
Live Crew (yawn) infamy, because he heard
that they sometimes perform topless. The
whole thing was ﬁlmed, and apparently they
all had a good time, once Luther got over the
shock of seeing the band sever fake penises
onstage. (He didn’t realize, apparently, that
he had invited a bunch of militant dykes to
hang out with him for his TV special.)

Musically, Tribe 8 does a lot more than
simply punk out, as most punk bands do
when they get bored. Being able to actually
play your instruments seems to be a disease
that is particular to the Bay Area; you may
recall that the Dead Kennedys had the same
“problem” in the early ‘80s. Watch them
play their instruments and spew propaganda
this Sunday when they play an all—ages show
at Charlie’s with In Pittsburglfs proof that
women can rock, the Barbed Wire Dolls
and also Oakland’s Favorite Punk Band

This is not hard to imagine, how—
ever, when you realize that KMFDM
has been making music since 1986,
when their first album, What Do You
Know Deutschland? was released on
an unsuspecting public.

Growing out ‘of the early ‘80’s
German dance halls, KMFDM was on
the forefront of the so—called
“Industrial Revolution.” The music of
KMFDM has a much more techno feel
to it than today’s newer guitar-inﬂu-
enced industrial bands like Gravity
Kills, Stabbing Westward, or Sister
Machine Gun.

The sound of KMFDM has grown

borrowing from other genres like
metal, techno, pop and jazz. It is this
melding of styles that lead to the
unique sound of KMFDM today. It
was not something that is easily dis-
covered overnight, and you can tell
that KMFDM has a sound that has
matured with a continual influx of
musical influences.

KMFDM is every bit as hard as
those newer industrial bands; they just
achieve it in a different way. If you
think about a mixture of KLF, Nine
Inch Nails, and Metallica, then you
probably get the gist of it.

Xtort is a great jumble of experi-
mental noise and rhythm. As front

“German engineering, astounding
ingenuity. Over a decade of conceptu-
al continuity.”

While this may just be overzeal-
ous self—promotion, it does describe
the evolution of KMFDM quite well.
The group is not afraid to experiment,
trying new technology and different
combinations of instruments in bizarre
new ways. Xtort is a prime example of
this, as the two main forces behind the
group, Konietzko and Gunter Schulz,
are joined by several guest musicians.

Throughout the album, the lineup
changes on practically every song.

Ministry members Chris Connelly and

noise-master Einheit
William Rietlin. This gives
Xtort a fresher feel than KMFDM’s
last album Nihil. While “Juke—Joint
Jezebel” was probably one of the most
accessible KMFDM tunes ever (it was
on several movie soundtracks), the
rest of Nihil remains pretty much a
standard industrial album.

Xtort provides a much better
example of KMFDM’s creativity in
experimentation. It is an excellent step
in KMFDM’s continual evolution. As
Thoreau said, “Music is continuous ——
only listening is intermittent.”
