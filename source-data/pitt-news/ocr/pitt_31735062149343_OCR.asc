Campus Canvass’
Asks Another Question

N an,_2uljoini,pg- column appears another in the

series of “ lainpus Canvass" columns, one of
the 1-'é‘gnl;+i- features of this year’s News.

life are piililisliiiig this column in line with our
,_r.ol7ic_v oi’ presenting: a wider opportunity to the
g-enerzil student body to express themselves on
topics of general interest. ‘

Today's question, though it may seem a little
remote from campus life strikes us as being one
ct’ vital importance. For in a North Side audi-
toriiun this week, meetings are being held which
will undoubtedly play a large part in the future of
organized labor in this country.

\Vlicther the CIO and the AFL will ever get to-
gether, just what the results of this week's orga1i-
izational convention will be, are subjects beyond
the scope of this editorial.

But the point is this-—we, as students, cannot
ignore problems such as these which have such
t’ar-rea.cliing' Slg'llll‘lc:lll('(‘. And from the answers
we have received to to(la_v's question. we gather
that many students agree with us and are deep-
ly interested in things l)t‘_VOll(l the limits of the
Oal<ian(l quadrangle.

“Don't resent it if the faculty does some back seat

NLRB Bats .500

Excerpt from the NATION: . _ _, '

“Unfair treatment of the NLRB by important
newspapers has been noted in ‘Washington. Hence
this comment now circulating, particularly among
nurwspapermen, in the capital. ‘The NLRB has a
batting average of .500; it wins all its cases in court
and loses them all in the ncwspapers’.”

Mrs. Mabel Cooper, housemotherat Kappa Alpha Theta,
University of Pittsburgh:
“American college girls have changed consider-
- ably ‘in-the last 18 years. Eighteen years ago, girls

Now they do most things on impulse, but they have

find that a certain librarian was the sole cause.

We Voted . . .

and felt awfully
self-conscious about it all. At least we did our duty
as a good citizen, even though we suspect our ‘vote
didn’t do too much good.

But the results of the election were somewhat sur-
prising to us, we must admit. Here everybody had been
expecting an even ﬁght between the Democrats and Re-
publicans, and venturing predictions that the GOP
might come through with a few state and national of-
ﬁces. But you know what happens. Without even
bothering to sliaké oﬁ the Pews and Annenbergs and
Grundys, the Republicans’ man James sweeps through
on top of an almost comple‘te"state-wide upheaval to
keep pace with the nation-wide trend. But, after ‘think-
ing it over these last couple of days .

We’1'e Not Worried . . .

too much. Sure, We remember J udge James’ -.2-aznpaign
promise to burn all the “Little New Deal” statutes he
were elected . and we’ve heard a lot about those
reactionary backers of his. But reineinoer, all this :30-
cial legislation of the Earle adrninistration is clown on
the books and has been in operation for some
time.

No doubt the new Governor and the Republican
House could throw out many of these laws and effect
drastic changes in others But the main question
to be considered before such a thing is done is “What
will the people say?” The citizens of the state, espe-
cially the working population, have had a taste of the
beneﬁts of many of these laws, from both state and na-
tional sources. They will, without. a doubt, insist on
their continuance, in some form or other.

And Besides . . .

Any good political scientist will tell you that once :1
law is on the books, it's not a very ‘easy process to get
it out. The Democratic adrninistra't.ion, in its four
years in Har1'isbu1‘g,' has enacted a sizeable body of
laws, many good,1some bad, others indifferent. We
think Governor-elect James will have one super-human
job rooting them all out and burning them, even with
the help of his inﬂuential fri"en"ds.

To Change the Subject . . .

We were glad that SFA President Downie issued 3.
statement interceding in this tribal warfare which has
been going on over on the- Tech campus ever since :1
certain sad Saturday’s football game. We were getting
pretty tired of opening up our morning paper and see-
ing pictures of fraternity boys in semi-scalped
state.

But the timely intervention of our president leaves
only one thing to puzzle us. We seem to remember
reading in the News a couple weeks back of how -SFA
Assembly commissioned Dovvnic to meet witli the presi-
dent of the Tech student council to attempt’ tb arrange
some sort of mutual non-aggression pact between stu-
dents of the two schools. So far, we ,‘qa\'en’t heard
anything more about it. Maybe were just being impo-
lite by bringing the subject up again, but we think :1
successful agreement on these lines might cut -lown
Jimmy Hagan’s goalpost budget and considerably lighten
he burdens of Oakland barbers.

W’e’re Still Hearing . . .

repercussions about that Orson Welle‘ “l\"I-en froni
Mars” broadcast, which makes us all the more :sorry
that we weren’t around to hear the program that Sun-
day night. We understand the duty—b0und Federal
Communications comm.i.ssion has issued a warning to
the networks and that the nation's populace rose in
righteous indignation against the cruel “hoax” that was
perpetrated against them.

Well, we‘fo'r onefrom what he have been able to
gather, don’t thilnlii’ that broadcast was a hoax or any-
thing near it. To us it takes on"th’e ap‘p‘ea’ra'nce of one
of the most important broadcasts since the invention of
radio.

For These Reasons . . .
first, it demonstrated what a powerful instrument radio
can be in forming public opinion and exciting public
emotion. Already in. Germany, where Adolf Hitler
-regularly blares into eveiy good Nazi home and beer
garden, and in Spain, to mention only a few places, it
has proved its importance. But to see‘ an innocent little
radio play cause such a mass uprising in ‘these United
States is just allittle too much. '

Growing out of this, we can see how it wouldn't be
as impossible as many people think to work on "the mass
sentiments and emotions of the great populace to pro-

'4.‘
ll

duce some sort of political upheaval or anti-democratic

‘upsurge. ' And we’ detect somehow a certain childish
simplicity coupled‘ with fear in the fifakeup of-the"g1"éat
mass of people which builds up ‘a gullibity that some
day may extend beyond Buck Rogers radio programs.

Campus
S Canvass

by Sam Rosenberg

Each week “Campus Canvass”
, brings to -you, via. The News, a ques-
ition, timely and of student interest.
§The students whose answers ap-
pear are selected at random
throughout the University.

The Question:

low do you interpret the recent
political setback suffered by the
CIO and the withdrawal of the In-
ternational Ladies’ Garment Work-.
ers’ Union from the Committee?

The Answers:
Marie Powell, C39.

“Although the withdrawal of the
ILGWU from the CIO will perhaps
lessen its numerical strength, a much
more far reaching effect on the real
strength of the CIO will probably be
seen in the swing toward conserv-
at.is:n in the recent election which
will greatly lessen the importance of
the CIO. It may even make Lewis’
organization more conciliatory to-
wai‘-d the AFL.

“l-"robabl_v they will in the end
Iloose all the rel‘ormist power they
, have gained.”

Chas. 0. Beltz, J12, SEE-11.

“I think that the loss of David
Dubinsl«:y’s union is a terriﬁc blow
to the CIO and although John L.
Lewis  taking a lacl~:adaisical atti-
iuds: it will probably break 
united ‘front of "'

i‘.-l:’-5
.1e ‘CEO which will
eventually bring him to terms with
the AFL.”

Dorothy Dcring, C39.

“Dubinsky’s present attitude re-
minds mc 01’ William Green’s posi-
tion during the depression when he
said the labor movement must re-
main inert and that it was up to in-
dustrial and ﬁnancial powers to re-
lieve the situation.

“Dubinsky hopes to bring the AFL
 the CIO together by withdraw-
ing from the CIO and remaining in-
dependent. Does he mean to .do_,it
by weakening the CIO so that it
must become conciliatory? If this
is his idea, his particiation in labor
movements is certainly negative.”
Paul Mahoney, L39.

“We can interpret these factors as
a swing of the pendulum toward
more conservative policies of gov-
ernment. This is a more normal sit-
uation when the basic principal of
political thought is private owner-
ship of property.”

Member of economics department
faculty:

“For the labor movement as 21
whole it n'~..:—1y be a somewhat fortun-
at.e.condition, because of the influ-
ence o.t' the union (that is, the ILGW
leaving the CIO) peaceful settlement
between the CIO and the AFL in.-_-..y
. be hasten_cd.”

Emily Bucar, C39.

“Because the Democrats have been
liberal toward the CIO and because
that party lost 77 seats i.n the house
along with particular states, inclur.'-
ln-.g Pennsylvania, I believe the CIO
has lost a great deal more than the
surface shows at this time.

“Tholoss of Dublnsky’s garment
wo1‘i:e1‘s may result as a strengthen-
ing force to the labor movement
which will ultimately result in com-
bining the AFL and the CIO but
about which we will be able to make
bet:;ei' predictions, pending the out-
come of the CIO convention, which is
being held here in Pittsburgh this
Week.”

Bill Fullet, ChE=l1.

“I thinl-: the loss of the garincnt
union is going to have {:1 pretty bad
effect on the CIO. Lewis has told the
press that the loss of 250,000 ITlelTll).'.‘l.‘S
at one blow does not mean anything;
if that is his attitude I think he will
suflcr more losses.”

Fresh Grid
Team Meets

With Weber

In an attempt to correct a “mis-
understanding,” a group of freshman

athletes met with John Weber, sec-_
rotary-business manager of the Uni- .

yesterday morning during

the third period.

versity,

The meeting was concerned with;

the
the

tuition notes that members
football basketball
were called upon to pay recently.

and teams

The "inisundcrstanding" concerned
the fact tliat these freshmen had
been led to understand that they
would be given jobs with which
they would be able to earn the‘-L:
boarcl and room.

They were also led to believe that
thei~.-;- would be scliolarship recipients.
Upon this point Mr. Weber dis-
agreed, claiming that the Univer-
sity's policy had no such provision.

The result of the meeting was a
temporary truce, with Mr. W/Veber
promising to look into the case, and
the freshmen agieeing to await his
decision.

_ place in the thirtieth IC.'~\;\AA cross-

country championship over the Van
Cortlandt Park course.

Crossing the line first was Penn
St:ite’s brilliant Bill Smith who won
‘the freshman race last year and who
is undefeated this year. Although
he was a favorite to win, it was ex-

ipected that the race would be-close,
1but he ﬁnished 200 yards ahead of

Joseph Moclair of Manhattan while
Maine's Don Smith trailedlin third
place.

Smitlfs winning time for the five-
rnile course was 26:32.4 minutes.
Coming in first for the Panthers was
the fast stepping Walt Sterner who
ﬁnished in seventh place in 27:34

Other runners scoring for Pitt were
Al Boulanger who ﬁnished four-

You Can’t Tell a Thing About

It's been an open season on football critics znul <lcinocrats. and

All season the Penn State football
team has been making ﬁbbers of the
so-called football experts to prove
the theory that football writers may
not always be right. They’ve been in
and outers all season, but they've
been in when they should’ve been
out and vice-versa.

It all started when Syracuse beat
Cornell, who later beat Dartmouth,
who were supposed to be the tops.
Penn State was supposed to be very
docile and behave when they met the
horrible -Orangemen from Syracuse.
Instead they‘ ‘upset the apple cart,
and not content with eking out a slim

So the bewildered football critics.

wrong by our critics. They had
dropped a 14-0 decision to Bucknell
and then they allowed Lafayette to
eke out a 7-6 victory. Again our
saddened yogis did a little swinging
and when Penn State met Penn, they
naturally backed the boys from
Quakertown. Who wou1dn’ta!

The win gave the Metallurgists the

p;actically conceded to them since
their impressive play in the first two
‘games of the season. The Mets

To be eliminated from the playoff, a
team must be beaten twice as in reg-
ular championship play. _

The old pass combination of Mann
to Leith did most of the damage as
the Mets came through in their only
severe test of the season. Leading
only 2-0 at the half, the Mets sewed
up the game shortly after the second
half opened when Mann flipped a 0-
yard touchdown heave to Leith in
the end zone.

After the Mets had kicked Off, a
punt gave them the ball on their
own 20. Mann passed to Leith for
three yards, and Leith followed with

a wide end sweep that went for a.

‘first down on the Electrical B 19.
Three passes were incomplete, then
Mann tossed to O’Donnell for ﬁve
-yards, the ball going to the EES on
down. On the first plaly. Reilly drove
through and tabbed Krane behind
his own goal line for two points.
The lone Electricals’ threat came
near thevend of the first half. Krane’s
pass from midﬁeld was taken by
Uptegraph on the Mets’ 17-yard line,
where he was immediately tagged.
Two plays later, Donics gathered in
a Krane aerial on the Metallurgists’
2. Reilly then broke up an attempt-
ed pass, nailing Krane 10 yards back
of the line. On fourth down, Krane
passed incomplete into the end zone.
Electrical _B kicked off to open the
second half, and the Mets marched
to a touchdown. Mann threw to
Leith a foot short of a ﬁrst down,
then, Leith made the distance on a
two-yard gallop around end. Un-
derwood took lVIann’s pass and was
stopped on the 4. Knapp ran to the

the Mets drew a ﬁve-yard offside
penalty. Mann then spotted Leith in
the corner of the end zone for a
score.

During the rest of the game, the
poor visibility kept both teams near

midﬁeld as ball carriers fumbled
snaps from center, and receivers
failed to locate passes. With one

minute to play, the game was called.

Brien of the Panthers scored on a
pass from Jackman in the first pe-

into a battle of strong defenses. Poe,
Pitt goalie, was exceptional, stopping
two penalty kicks in addition to all
of Frostburg’s regular drives.

* The Phi Garns threatened early in
the gameafter Mitchell intercepted
Cashdollaar’s pass on the Phi Delt
15-yard line. However, Scherer in-
tercepted Dimit’s pass on the ten-
yard line to halt the Phi Garn march.
Shortly before the half ended, Phi
Delta Theta made it first down on

dollar's pass. Three passes and a
quarterback sneak only advanced to
the 2-yard line where the Fijis took
possession of the ball.

All the scoring was conﬁned to the
second halféwith the Fijis registering
six points one minute after the kick-
Off. Cashdolla:’s pass was inter-
cepted by Bob Burns who had just
entered the game, and cinderman

Burns sprinted 20 yards for the
i; score. Bill Edmund’s pass to Burns

in the end zone slipped off Bob's
hands, as the extra point went bad.

Neither team was able to advance
the ball beyond midﬁeld as the two
teams shadow-boxed in the center
of the gridiron.

the break which enabled them to
win. Bob Black intercepted Ed-

ed to invade the Tech campus after
dark and remove the Pitt goal
posts. Some of the Tech fellows
in ambush objected. The Pitt lads
were rushed across the street to the
Tech fraternity houses and given
a close shave. The Tech lads

on the faces of the three members

‘Dr. Hart Gives

‘-3 Culttire Theory 

Modern civilization can survi\'e

, only if we have a cooperative pattern ,

,0: science and religion. Dr. I-lornell

 Hart, author, lecturer, and professor-

 of sociology and anthropology at
 Duke university. told students at last
il\rIor1day's meeting

Forum.

1

i Dr. Hart refused to accept the the- t
5 Sorokin, .3
land Ogburn and advanced his own;
which states that civilizations do not ‘

ories of Petrie, Spengler,

go through birth then to death, but
swing from sensate to ideational.

‘ “Sensate civilization,” he deﬁnes,
'; “is a materialistic one where values
are determined by the empirical
method. The other «extreme is the
ideational, or spiritual.”

_ “Past civilizations have disintegra-
ted because their peoples became
possessed with a sensate outlook. If
we look around us we can find relics
of the magniﬁcent cities of Egypt,
Mesopotamia, and Mexico, which are
now empty ribs of unburied corpses,”
he declared.

Presenting a rather complicated
theory of his own, Dr. Hart places
much importance on an “inner
.world.” “Three aspects of this inner
f world are memory images, verbal ab-
istractions and wordless conscious-
guess,” he reveals.

“The fundamental diﬁiculty with
‘science today is that it had no busi-
iness to deal with this inner world. I
‘have reached this decision because
it appears that for every advance
made ‘;owarcl lengthening life similar
strides have been made to shorten
it,” he says.
