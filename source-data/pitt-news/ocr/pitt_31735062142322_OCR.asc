is likely to be THE game of the year for 
Pitts, for this is the game that will show how
good they really are.

Unfortunately, Pitt did not come away,
from Great Lakes unscathed. They lost the
services of Left End Chick Gestner who in- .
jured his knee, and it is still debateable as
to whether Center George Allshouse, also
out with a knee injury, will be sufficiently
mended in time to take his regular place in -
the lineup tomorrow.

Mike- Sotack, second team man last year,
is slated to take over the left end position.
This is apparently open season on Pitt cen-
ters.‘ First Larry Braner, second string center
was knocked out for the season in Minnesota‘
game. Howard Scott, third string center is
out with a broken foot. And now Allshouse
is on the sidelines.‘ If he is unable to play
Jim Clowes, who shifted from end when Scott
was injured will take over at center.

it   Views About
"Final Victory

“' _-By MIKE LAZAROFF

 

  

ruse... As.  

 

, Inaugurating its new series of
‘forums for this year, Pitt Town
‘meeting presented four prominent

I ‘University students in discussion of

“What Is Ultimate Victory” be-
fore an enthusiastic audience of

Wstudents and faculty last Tuesday,

October 13. The student speakers

. were Aldo Icard.i, C43; Irwin Rosen,

'  C43; Miriam Rosenbloom, transfer
1 from PCW, and Edward Tablac,
“- BA43.

Delivering the first talk, Icardi

A a declared that “we must build a
"foundation for the future world
1 . upon sincerity” which means the

abolition of intolerance and
S discrimination. He continued that

» “unless we believe that we can
 live, sleep, and eat with the vari-

I ous races of the world, we can-

: not understand what ultimate vic-

tory means.” Ivcardi emphasized

. that “we cannot get brotherhood
A of man if nationalism is to per-
‘ sist.”

’ Irwin Rosen, second speaker on
the program, reasserted that the
end of nationalism isa goal to be
worked for. True relationships
among the various peoples of the
world, he said, transend ,national
boundaries.” Rosen warned that we
must not succumb to the wave of
reaction after the war aimed at
sweeping aside the social gains be-
ing realized today as a result of the
united effort. “The gains we make
today are not for the duration but
for the duration of human pro-
gress.”
Pesenting the woman’s view-‘

" fpoint in the discussion, Miriam

I Rosenbloom declared that secur-
ity, peace, and strong economic

V foundations must be guaranteed

so that “we will not feel that we
will have to start all over again

‘ after the war.” Miss Rosenbloom

explained that in order to combat
andgovercome the evils of nation-
alism, we must have an adequate
appreciation of our own cultures

V and the cultures of others as well.

Last student speaker at the

-meeting, Edward Tablac introduced

the thought that America must be
guided to a great extent by relig-
ious thought if it is to deal with

.this problem adequately and in-

telligently. “We must have faith in
the goodness "of our fellow men,”
exclaimed Tablac, “and we must,
have religion if we are to under-
stand the kind of spirit in which
the world is to live.” Stressing the
need for the economic security for
all peoples of the world, he admon-
ished that we all together must‘
share the responsibility of aiding
all of those in need. j
Following the talks, three fac-
ulty members, speciﬁcally invit-
ed to the meeting, directed ques-
tions at the speakers involving
some of the statements that had
been made. D. Ben Williams, pro-
fessor of political science, asked
how extensive ' ultimate victory
was to be. Icardi answered that
ultimate victory must provide for
all.

Dr. Deitze, assistant professor of
psychology, pointed out that “there
is nothing ultimate about ultimate
victory, but that is it a progressive

' change,” to which the speakers

agreed and Rosen added that Fas-
cism and its causes were the great

‘ obstacles which must be overcome

in the progress of human civiliza-
tion that Dr. Deitze spoke of.

At the end ofthe meeting, Hal
Gondelman, C43, publicity chair-

Oman,’ announced that an oﬂicial

British ﬁlm revealing the actual
bombing scenes in the Battle for
Britain will be shown. at Pitt town
meeting Tuesday. The ﬁlm is equip-

‘ ped with a sound track and has

been obtained through Dr. Geise
and Dr. Peter Gray of the Univer-
sity Civilian Defense.

The ticket for admission to the
Zeta Tau Alpha bridge on Monday
afternoon is a 25 cent defense

 On Aid  cm... . 

   

    

Last week ﬁve young ﬁghters of the United Nations
spoke at Pitt. An incident during their stay brought to mind
theremarkable habit of people for judging the importance
of a war by its mileage from their kitchens.

Wendell Wilkie is reported to have told Stalin that in

general Lend—Lease aid has followed American public opinion:
thus, mathematically, if the Gallup poll showed China to hold
one per cent of the popularity that Russia held, usually and
in time China would ﬁnd herself receiving but one per cent
of what the Soviet Union was receiving.

Yung Wang, our guest from China poignantly bespoke
the anti—mathematical View of one who has seen her fellow
men die in an uncaptivating struggle. She who has partici-
pated deeply in a ﬁght that she knows ‘goes beyond the nation-
alism of China felt the terrible impact of apathy in America
for her country’s role: apathy that will be the deathof the

cream of our ﬁghting alley.

We know that American production is not at high enough
a level for us to ﬁll the arms needs of each of our allies——that
the choice must be made onwhich front the next tank off

the line will ﬁght. A choice must be made; the protest is not

on its fact but on its method: what defense but that of slovenly
thinking can be made for using the Gall-up poll as a substitute
for military strategy tempered by a living belief in the power
and brotherhood in the united common peoples of the earth.
The ﬁnal comment on American apathy should better
stress the need for thinking in terms of a united world people

rather than any speciﬁc proposal for

handed-down ideology.

Works Hard, Successfully

By BOB COOK

If you are an air raid warden in
your local district, you know what
an enormous job you have.

Last January, Dr. Einar W.
Jacobsen, dean of the School of
Education and director of Uni-
Versity defense, appointed Dr.
John J. Geise, associate profes-
sor of h‘istory,.as his assistant
to the post of air raid warden for
the University.

Since that time Dr. Geise has
been woking almost twelve hours
per day perfecting a program of
defense that has made the Cathe-
dral and the University one o'f the
safest zones of this area in the
event of an attack from the air.
Two of the ﬁrst evidences of pro-
gram were the air raid instruction
placards that appeared throughout
the University buildings, and the
drills that were held last January.
During the next month, 75 men
were trained in ﬁrst aid.

'We Gotta Watch Our Liberties; Save 'Em

lot of deep thinking to figure out.
It gets me pretty mixed up from
the ﬁrst. In the ﬁrst sentence it
says, “Ever since human beings
lived in caves . . . the progress of
civilization has been measured by
the peope able to leave the pack
and care for themselves.” And here
I learned in ﬁfth grade history that
the cave man didn’t get anywhere

until they learned to get together

with each other and form tribes so
that they could help each other and
divide labor among themselves.
The second part doesn’t help
clear nothing up, neither. This

don’t want our freedom, because
of these 19_million ignorant for-
eigners who come here since 1900.

He says all most of them came for
-was to “share the ready-made pros-
perity.”

And he says that probably be-
cause of them one of these pubic
opinion polls says that “ of all
Americans who have an opinion,
only 41 per cent thought some form
of Socialism would be bad. Ten
years ago this would have been in-
credible; it is not increditable to-
day.”

I’m not so good at arithmetic,
but I know that 19 million ain’t no
41 per cent, so all Socialists ain’t
foreigners.

Another part of this article gets
A me to feeling pretty ashamed of
myself. Here I haven’t been ap-
preciating the poor capitalists
_ who “continue to risk their money
competing with one another for
public patronage” just so the con-
sumer, like me, can get the bene-
ﬁts of lower costs when this “in-
ventive and management genius
of a gifted minority . . . could have
made more proﬁt investing their
money in Government bonds than
putting it into their businesses.”
Government bonds pay only 21/;
per cent, don’t they? And what
was it the Truman committee
showed about .war proﬁts——up, in
onecase to 4,280 per cent.

And to make a longer story short
this gap says that what we have
to holdonto is economic freedom.
“The freedom to develop man’s pro-
ductive abilities, sell them to the
highest bidder and retain for him-
self and his family a fair share of
the beneﬁts.” I guess s-o, but I
don’t like auctions, so I dunno.

Bowser Declines Optimism

E3; JERRY RIPP

Although his team gained a
“moral” victory last Saturday af-
ternoon by holding the powerful
Great Lakes eleven to one touch-
down and, nearly scored an upset,
Pitt football coach Charlie Bowser
is not too optimistic over the pros-

_pects of winning tomorrow from

Indiana.

It seems that the Fighting Hoos-

iers are another team that is over-

loaded with better than average

grid material. According to the re-
ports Bowser received from assist-
ant coach Doc Hartwig who scout-
ed Indiana, the Hossiers have one

up of the best balanced teams in the

Western conference.

However, Bowser did say that the
Panther cause was not hopeless. He

- stated, “If we could play the ball

,we played last week we’d’ have a

. chance.” Bowser then added that
it it was hard to expect the team to

be “up” every Saturday in view of
the schedule that they have been

' facing and will continue to face.

.

The Panther mentor pointed out
that with Bob White, captain o'f the

. Indiana team, back in shape after
L being out for a short while with an

injury, the visitors tomorrow will
have a full squad of experienced
backs to throw at his team. ‘

Other backs expected to cause
_the Blue and Gold trouble tomor-
row, according to Bowser, are Billy
Hillenbrand, last year’s sophomore
ace, Hugh McKinnas, Negro soph-
omore sensation from Farrell, Pa.,
and Lou Saban another junior.

A Injuries may also hamper the
Panthers’ efforts tomorrow. End
Norb Gestner deﬁnitely is out of
the lineup and George Allshouse,
ﬁrst string center, may also have
to watch the game from the bench.

 Students Ollerecl

Work in Mills

Possibilitiespfor part time em-
‘ployment this fall are very good,
according to a report issued by R.

Don Hamilton, student director of
the men’s part-time employment
bureau.

‘Among the positions that have

i' been and are being ﬁlled by the

part time work of Pitt students are
special shifts at one of the larger

I A steel works and ushering at theatre

matinees.

Later this fall, and especially
around the Christmas season, there
will be a great demand for depart-
ment store and post ofﬁce workers.
Anyone desiring this work is urg-

ed‘ ed to apply now at the employment

oﬂice, 819 Cathedral. Those persons
seeking employment as shoe store
salesmen have been very success-

 I ful in their efforts so far.

Lack of male workers is laid to
two sources_.‘the draft, and the num-

Sees Hard lndiana Game

CHARLES BOWSER
every team has bad days

However, the .Panthers have
shown that they can make trouble
for the opposition. Coach Bowser
may be right in his analysis of to-
morrow’s situation, but we think
that he’s trying to keep the team

from getting over—conﬁdent. A team ‘
I that can hold Great Lakes for three

and a half periods has more than
just spirit.

Pitt Jayvees Supply Hope For  

Future-—-Tie Navy "3" Squacl ,

Last Saturday at Annapolis the
Pitt Junior Varsity held a highly-
favored Navy “B” team to 6-6 tie.
Contrary to previous reports, the
Middies were favorites, for al-
though accelerated graduation and
scholastic programs have payed
havoc with their teams, the men of
Annapolis have once again come
through with a strong Junior Var-
sity outﬁt. ‘ ‘

Outstanding for the Panthers
was. Lind Lauro, whose -fullbacking
in this game gave promise that
Iron-Man Saksa will have a cap-
able successor when graduation

time rolls around. Lauro’s ball—han-
dling was, plainly put, terriﬁc, and
his defensive play put the Navy
men in a “What’l1 he do when he’s
a varsity man” frame of mind.

Lauro also scored the Panthers’
only touchdown, in the second quar-
ter. Navy scored early in the ﬁrst
quarter, but although they threaten-
ed more than once as the game wore
on, ﬁne Pitt defensive play in the
shadow of their goal-posts prevent-
ed any further score for the home
team. .

..Fig ures Drop

Revealing that only 450 students.
registered for the University’s stu.

rlson, director of Men's Health
her-vice, urged students today to
hke advantage of the drive that
has been extended until tomorrow
‘and sign up immediately.

Beneﬁts that may be realized
from the $2.25 payment are so
‘great that it is foolish not to en-
roll in the plan, according to Dr.
Carlson. He cited many cases of
students last yeat who failed to
register for hospitalization and
who were later required to ex-
pend much greater sums during
illness.

Last semester 32 of the 575 stu-
{dents enrolled in the hospitaliza-
tion plan were hospital cases. These
students spent a total of 204 days
in the hospital with a cost amount-
log to $1,250.80.

Students may register for the
hospitalization plan by the payment
of the $2.25 semester fee at the
Teasurer’s oﬁice on the twenty-
fourth ﬂoor.

“The young physician should nev-
er be sent among his great respon-
sibilities, without the preparation
that human wisdom, and that the
experience of former ages, can be-
stow upon him.” So spoke the Rev-
erend Robert Bruce, ﬁrst principal
of the Western University of Penn-
sylvania, now the University of
Pittsburgh, in his inaugural address
in 1822.

Made Theme

Ol Key lntormation Center

BY MYRON LEVINE

“What Are We Fighting For?" is the present theme featured by
the war information library on the sixthgﬂoor of the Cathedral. The
library is an integral part of the Key Center of War Information and

Training, one of 140 units on other
campuses throughout the country.
At Pitt the activities of the key
center are directed through the Uni-
versity Committee on Student and
Faculty Morale, headed by Dr. John
W. Oliver, professor and head of
the history department.

Lorena Garloch, reference librar-
ian, is the administrator of the
library committee headed by Dr. A.
L. Silverman, professor and head
of the chemistry department. The
program division is under the direc-
tion of Dr. Charles W. Lomas, in-
structor in English.

According to Miss Garloch, the
main purpose of the War Informa-

tion library is to convey to the stu- ‘

dent body a clariﬁed picture of the

Engineers Open
Two-Day Meet

With registration at Hotel Web-
ster Hall today counselors and stu-
dents of Student Branches, District

Electrical Engineers open their an-
nual two-day convention.

Some 75 to 100 representatives
from 23 engineering schools in
New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
West’ Virginia, Ohio, and Penn-
sylvania are expected to attend.

A banquet and trip to the Buhl
Planetarium will highlight today’s
program of business sessions. The
banquet, scheduled for 6 o’clock in
the University room of Webster
Hall, will feature E. A. Holbrook,
dean of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines, speaking on “The
Place of the Engineer,” and James
Potts, former Pitt track coach, with
his subject, “Highlights of 1936
Olympic Games.” Recorded music
will be furnished by Edwin Blair
Henry and R. C. Gorham, associate
professor of electrical engineering,
will serve as toastmaster.

Inspection trips of University
buildings, a lecture, and the Pitt-
University of Indiana game tomor-
row williconclude activities.

war effort in the United States as
well as the other allied nations. To
accomplish this, the library staff
has collected and catalogued some
one thousand pamphlets as well as
all the latest and most up-to-date
material about the war.

Practically every one of the allied
nations and particularly those in
exile manage to get their reports
to the students of Pitt via the In-
formation Library. Free publica-
tions are being supplemented by the
University library and faculty
members from their private collec-
tions of material about the war
effort in this area.

Also of great interest to the stu-
dents is the bulletin board facing
the collection of war material show-
ing the latest newspaper and mag-
azine clippings, cartoons, and book
lists.

It is hoped that the library,
which is rapidly becoming larger
and more important will be of great
service to the University. “We feel

that we have something of deﬁnite .

value to offer to the students,” con-
cluded Miss Garloch.

New Dean ol Law Finds Chinese Students

l.il<e Americans in lndustry, Patriotism

“Chinese students are as indus-
lzrious and patriotic as American
‘students. They are keenly interest-
ed and alive to social and economic
problems. They realize the neces-
pity of modernizing the political
fund economical institutions of their

A juountry in order to maintain its in-

dependence.”

That is the opinion fo Dr. Jud-
son Adams Crane, new dean of
Pitt’s School of Law, who taught
Anglo-American law in China in

  
  
 

 , 1911. He set up his classroom in
..,_gAie-Yang, meaning north coun-‘

  
  

the capitol, Peking. Oddly enough
all lectures were given in English,
from English textbooks.
Enrollment in this Chinese uni--
versity was on somewhat of a schol-
arship basis, with competitive pro-
schools as the medium of selection.
Young men chosen ranged from 20
to 25 years of age and were highly
versed in public affairs. '
Shortly after his arrival, Dr.
Crane was caught in a violent
revolution led by Sun-Yat-Sen,
a Chinese patriot who was seek-
ing to ovei-throw the Empire and
set up a republic intits place. In
‘the course of the rebellion and
‘because’ the school was located in

  
  

classes were dismissed for several
months.

During the three years which he
spent in China, Dr. Crane had an
opportunity to study the people and
country with enlightening results.
As far back as he can remember,
the Chinese have felt a distrust to-
ward the Japanese. They have long
realized that they would have to
resist territorial encroachments.
China has unlimited resources, es-
pecially in mining, agriculture, and
man-power.

The future of this gigantic na-
tion now rests in the hands of
these young men. . A

School of Medicine Established in 1903~c

At the time of this speech the
University had not even establish-
ed a School of Medicine, and it was
not until 1908 that the Medical
School became an integral part of
the University.

Today, faced with a world at
war, the School of Medicine is
well prepared to carry the bur-
den that exists, claims William
.S. McEllroy, dean of the School
of Medicine. “Few University stu-
dents realize the extent to which
the Medical Center has grown.
The Medical Center of 1942 is
made up of: the Presbyterian
Hospital, Elizabeth Steel Magee
Hospital, Eye and Ear Hospital,

a The Women’s Hospital of Pitts-

burgh, the newly dedicated West-
ern State Psychiatric hospital,
the nearly completed City Hos-
pital, and the Falk clinic. Total
bed capacity of this group is
over 1,300 beds, and witth -the
Medical School aboratory Build-
ings, represent an investment of
$20,000,000.

In addition to these hospitals
which comprise the Medical Center
group, the School of Medicine has
teaching affiliations with the Mercy,
Allegheny General, St. Francis,
Tuberculosis League hospital, and
Leech Farm. Though not located on
the campus, these institutions play
just as important a role in training
future physicians.

The medical student at Pitt gets
actual hospital contact with pa-

   

   
 
 

 4;-

   

 

 

 

tients in the various institutions of. , p
the Medical Center during his juni- ”

or year. He is under the guidance "A

of a teacher or staff man. He is as- 
signed to a case and compiles the

history of the patient, makes physi-
cal examinations, undertakes sim-
ple laboratory procedures, and
takes blood and urinal analysis. Af-
ter this preliminary task is com-
pleted, he must write a summary
and diagnosis of the case, to be fol-
lowed by his opinion for a course of
treatment. His work is checked by
a senior instructor who then points
out the errors in a series of con-
ferences and lectures.

Seniors in the School of Medi- ‘
' cine develop their medical knowl-
edge further by personal contacts
ith patients in dispensaries and
clinics. Here they have an oppor-
tunity to study disease in its in-
cipient stage, a knowledge so
necessary for preventive measw .
ures or early recognition of dis- ~
ease that it may mean the differ-' .l

 

 

 

ence between life and death. It ‘ 

is more diﬂicult to diagnose a
case in its ﬁrst stages than to
treat a patient conﬁned in bed.
That is why thejunior student
is placed in the hospital and the
senior student is stationed in the
‘dispensary. n
University students may easily
see now how vital and necessary the
Medical -Center is to the Schoolof
Medicine, asserted Dr. McElroy.
Rev. Bruce’s plan has certainly
been carried out by the. University.

Cap and Gowner Kelley At
lt Again--Now for the Army

He’s a guy who graduated from Pitt in 1939, took pre-med, majored
in economics, was in three Cap and Gown shows, was the Panther mas- 
cot, worked on the Pitt Panther, and carried twenty-two credits  ‘

senior year. I could say that and
then stop, but there is so much
more to “the guy.”

Fred Kelly is now appearing in
“This Is The Army” at the Nixon
theatre . . . nightly, and matin-
ees Wednesday and Saturday,
plug . . . and a 1-A man who
became an A-1 soldier. Sitting
backstage in the theatre on Tues-
day, with khaki-clad men walking
in and out, he gave me the high-
lights of his past, present, and
what he hopes to be his future.

Here at school, Fred‘ majored in
economics, and considered Dr. John
Ferguson tops. He recalled the
many times “Fergy” had helped
him in his economics, for . . . “I
was never considered much of a
student.” Nevertheless, Fred car-
died 22 credits his last year, plus
teaching dancing eight hours a day
in his own studio, directing dances
at the Playhouse, andat the many
religious organizations a round
town.

Corporal Kelly received -a
lovely Valentine day gift last
year—his induction into the
Army. He was stationed at
Camp Stewart in Georgia. . . .“in
the middle of the biggest swamp
of all Georgia swamps.” He was
an aid in the hospital, being in
the Medical corps. He still takes
care of injured boys in the show,
for until last week, the company
had no medical oﬂicer. Now, Fred
is his assistant. A’
