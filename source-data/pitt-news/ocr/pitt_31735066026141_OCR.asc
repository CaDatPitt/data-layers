Newly-
formed

policy
kicks in

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer

Last winter, students donned
every thing from long under-
wear, hats and wool socks to
boots rugged enough to brave
Antarctica, just to trek five or
so blocks to class.

Then they saw it. After their
decision to be good students by
going to class, and after all of
the grumbling and preparation,
they saw the sign on the door.

Class cancelled.

Due to last year’s excessive
amount of snow and freezing
temperatures, Pitt Chancellor J .
Dennis O’Connor issued a
severe weather policy effective
Jan. 3.

The policy states that the uni-
versity will remain open in all
but extreme circumstances,
although students and staff are
urged to use their own discre-
tion in deciding whether they

can safely commute to class or

to work.

“This policy tries to bring
some consistency to what, if
anything, will be done in severe
weather,” said Pitt Director of
Communications Ken Service.

Just because classes are can-
celled, that does not mean the
university is I closed.
Notification of the cancellation

T of all classes will be aired on

TV and radio. For questions
regarding the cancellation of a
specific class, students should
contact the school or depart-
ment that offers the course.
“We really want people to
listen to the radio and TV so
they know what’s going on as
early as possible,” said Darlene

University offers cancer risk evaluation

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

If your family has a history of a certain
form of cancer, then a new program might
be able to help you by evaluating and reduc-
ing your risks of getting cancer.

One of only a handful of programs like
this in the country, the Cancer Genetics
Program established by Magee-Women’s
Hospital and the University of Pittsburgh “is
certainly one of the biggest in scope and
depth,” said Dr. John Mulvihill, medical
director of the Cancer Genetics Program.

The program will offer counseling for can-
cer risk assessment and prevention and will
inform patients of the most current informa-
tion on inherited cancers.

“I think it is [important,] because one in
three Americans will get cancer in a life-
time,” said Mulvihill.

This program is specialized for those indi-
viduals with two or more relatives of their
immediate family with any form of cancer. It
also includes two or more distant relatives
with the same or related cancers, cancer
occurring at an early age, rare cancers or
more than one tumor in one organ.

According to Mulvihill, there are many
environmental factors and lifestyle charac-
teristics which can increase a person’s
chance of getting cancer. Through this pro-
gram, people can become aware of the risks
in their lives and take steps to eliminate or
reduce them.

People with an increased risk also can fre-

quently go for screening tests so to deter-
mine cancer at its earliest and treatable stage,
as well as enter clinical studies testing the
effectiveness of cancer prevention.

“We think knowledge is better than igno-
rance or denial,” Mulvihill said.

According to Mona Penles Stadler, coordi-
nator of the Cancer Genetics Program, some
people who have a family history of cancer
may overestimate their risk of developing
cancer. “Knowing one’s actual risk rather

than a perceived one, based on family or --

genetic tests, can provide a sense of control.”

For more inforrnation,call the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute’s Cancer Information and
Referral Service at 1-800-237-4724 or
Magee-Women’s Hospital at 1-800-454-
8156.

Students
argue
for fun

By Susan Perfater
For The Pitt News

The Pitt debate team
is currently rated fourth
in the nation.

This applies only to
the varsity squad which
includes Bryon Gill,
Jim Lyle, Tony
Marsowicz and Carl
Schifferle. Wake Forest
University holds first
position, followed by
Northwestern
University and the
University of Kansas.

Cecilia Graves, direc-
tor of the debate team,
holds high expectations

” for the varsity debaters’

future.

“The top debaters
have the chance to be
regularly recognized
nationally,” she said.

Formally called the
William Pitt Debating
Union, the Pitt debate
team also ranks eighth
in the overall squad
division. The rankings
were sent out by the
National Debate
Tournament at the end
of November, and new
rankings are expected
soon.

The team has had
seven competitions thus
far and is looking ahead
to its next competition
Jan. 20-22 at George
Mason University.

Graves is pleased
with the team’s progress
over the past semester.

“I feel the squad’s
made a big turnaround,”
she said.

She dedicates the
team’s success to its
excellent researchers

' and to the great amount ‘

of time the debaters
invest in preparation.
Each year a new topic
is introduced by the

Tournament. All com-
petitors must adhere to

Library veteran takes care of books

By George Cann
For The Pitt News

Sitting back in his chair with
many books staring him in the
face is what Charles Aston
said he loves about his profes-
sion. Aston is in charge of rare
books and manuscripts in
Pitt’s Department of
University Libraries, called
Special Collections, located
on the third floor of the
Hillman Library.

“I really enjoy working with
old, unique and unusual mate-
rial,” said Aston. Aston also
said some of his interest in
working with Special
Collections is meeting and
having contact with outside
professions.

“I am really fortunate, work-
ing most of my career in an
area that is interesting, with a
lot of diversity,” said Aston.

Aston graduated from Pitt,
where he worked as an under-
graduate while pursuing his
degree as a student assistant
part-time in the fine arts
library. He later applied and
became a circulation assistant
in the old main library in the
Cathedral of Learning while
finishing his undergraduate
studies.

After some consideration,
Aston said he decided to
attend the School of Library

and Information Science.
After graduation, he worked in
the reference department,
shortly after acting as head of
the department.

Aston is treasurer for the
Pittsburgh Bibliophiles and a
member of the its advisory
council. He-has been active in
the Bibliophiles for 20 years.
The primary function of the
Bibliophiles is to hold a meet-
ing five or six times a year
with a speaker present.

“I’ve always .
thought that it
is important for
someone from
the library
department to
be involved,”
Aston said. He
added that the meetings,
which began two years ago,
are held at the Hillman
Library.

Aston said he is also grate-
ful teaching a Freshmen
Studies class. He is one of two
librarians who are involved in
teaching.

“From what I have seen,
most of the freshmen see the
class as worthwhile,” said
Aston. He also added that the
class is a good experience for
both the students and the fac-
ulty members.

Aston said his main concern
for new freshmen are the dis-

tractions due to the complexi-
ty of the university

“lt’s important that fresh-
men allocate themselves to
pursue an outside interest,”
said Aston. He also said Pitt
instituted the Freshmen
Studies class to improve the
rate of success and so fresh-
men wouldn’t get disgruntled.
After being here for three
decades, Aston said he can see
a major change in the univer-
sity.

“It has
become much
more known

for a greater
reputation due
to professional
s c h o o l s ’
growth,” said
Aston.

He also said the physical
aspect of the university has
Changed. “I can still remember
when Forbes Field was right
out here on the lawn,” Aston
said, looking out the window.

In Aston’s opinion, the uni-
versity still has to come to an
agreement about the teaching.

“My honest feeling is that
teaching has not improved in
the last three decades,” said
Aston. “What has improved is
the amount of courses and
programs for the students’
use.”

A concern Aston said he has

with the university is the
accessibility for students and
faculty members.

“It is extremely important
that we consider undergradu-
ate teaching in the College of
Arts and Sciences and related
schools,” said Aston, who
added that students need more
ability to access information.

Aston said the upcoming
expansion of the Hillman
Library is long overdue.

“Most of us are very excited
because this is the first time in
many years that there will be
more space for the students’
use,” he said. Aston’s depart-
ment and others will be relo-
cating to the Masonic Temple.

“lt should be a very elegant
and handsome addition,” said
Aston. T

Hillman Library has been
serving for over 25 years as
the general purpose humani-
ties and social science library
for both graduates and under-
graduates.

When Aston is not heavily
engrossed in his work at the
library, he spends his time
with his wife, walking their
dogs, reading and travelling.

Aston did have some advice
for Pitt students:

“Treasure the time and
understand how important it is
that you have the opportunity
to learn.”

Lewis, an associate vice chan-
cellor.

A group consisting of repre-
sentatives from various offices
under the chancellor is respon-
sible for maintaining consisten-
cy in their closing decisions.
They determine how severe the
weather is and what the travel
conditions are like and then
advise the chancellor on
whether or not to cancel class-
es.

“Last year was very confus-
ing as to whether or not classes
were cancelled or not. This pol-
icy is important because it
states that only the chancellor
has the authority to close the
university,” said Lewis.

Although the policy mainly
addresses employees, it covers
everyone from far away com-
muters to students living in the
dorms said Service.

“Last year, it seemed that
[university officials] focused
more on people living here in
the dorms than the university as
a whole,” said senior Marty
Edwards.

“It was a nightmare. And
what made it worse was that
Oakland seemed to be the only
one having ‘classes on a couple

of occasions. Greensburg
would cancel theirs and
Oakland would still have
them,” said Edwards, who com-
mutes from Jeannette and also
takes classes at Pitt’s
Greensburg campus.

“It made the semester more
stressful and definitely affected
my grades.”

The policy states that only by
authorization of the chancellor
would the university be official-
ly closed, although the presi-
dents of the regional campuses
are authorized to officially close
their respective campuses.

‘‘I couldn’t believe they were
having classes. It was absolute
hell trying to get to them,” said
sophomore Danielle Shuster.

Senior Paul Opferman said,
‘‘I only slipped and fell two
times last winter. There could
have been more salt put down,
and even though the parking
spaces were plowed, I couldn’t
reach them because of the huge
mounds of snow that were
blocking them.”

The university has no policy
on shoveling snow I and
salting sidewalks because, “it’s
the law to do it,” said Leon
Haley, vice chancellor for stu-
dent and public affairs.

Debate

°From page 3

their own angles and inter-
pretations.

Last year’s topic
addressed the presidency.
This year’s topic relates to
the rules and guidelines of
pre-trial detention and sen-
tencing.

The team has approached
civil disobedience and
inconsistent sentencing. For
example, the team has found
through research that blacks
are 40 times more likely to
receive the death penalty
than whites, even if the
crime they committed was
the same. Therefore, one of
the two-partner debate
teams has taken a position

in favor of the Racial Justice
Bill that was included in the
Crime Act. Regarding the
civil disobedience issue, the
team suggests accused peo-
ple should not be denied the
opportunity to explain the
reason for their behavior.

Lyle and Marsowicz, two
of the varsity debaters,
admit that debating leaves
little time for other activi-
ties. Marsowicz is a resident
assistant in Tower B an.d
Lyle, though not involved in
any other organizations, said
he would like to be if he had
more time.

“I probably put in 10
hours a week [in research]_.”
he said.

Marsowicz is attracted to
the competitiveness of
debate. Lyle is more direct
about his involvement.

“I enjoy the arguing,” he
said.

Graves points out that the

lWilliam Pitt Debating

Union is open to everyone.

“We have an open squad
policy. You don’t have to be
an experienced debater to
participate in debate,” she
said.

At the end of March, the
William Pitt Debating
Union will compete against
11 other districts in the
national competition at West
Georgia College in
Carrollton, Ga.

Help prevent assault

Sexual assault is an issue that keeps rearing its ugly head. It
is an all too pervasive problem on college campuses. In an
effort to control this problem, the University of Pittsburgh has
set up a program to educate students about sexual assault, pro-
vide victims with help and create a peer educator program.

The peer education program is designed to let students edu-
cate others on campus through presentations made to various
groups. Among the groups included were fraternities and
sororities, Office of Residence Life groups and freshman stud-
ies classes. The goal is to raise awareness concerning sexual
assault and thus reduce the incidence of it on campus.

The coordinator of Sexual Assault Services is now looking
for more men to become peer educators. Right now there is a
group of 35 students who are peer educators. Males are often,
by virtue of their greater physical strength, the offenders in
sexual assault cases. This is why it is important for more men
to become involved with training to help prevent these prob-
lems.

Because this issue is important to everyone on campus, it is
important to make as many people aware as possible. This can
only be done by having as many people involved as possible.

Anyone interested in becoming a peer educator should see

Center, 334 William Pitt Union.

End the spoils system

On Monday, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich dis-
missed House Historian Christina Jeffrey after it came to
light that she criticized an educational program on the
Holocaust because it did not include the views of Nazis and
the Ku Klux Klan. Although Gingrich claims he had no
knowledge of the statement until recently, Jeffrey’s assistant,
Lois Kubal, said he was aware of the comments in December
(The New York Times).

According to The New York Times, Gingrich had also made
arrangements for Jeffrey’s husband to work as his “personal
chronicler.” The last House historian, Raymond Smock,
ought not to have been fired, having served since 1983 when
the post was created. Yet, in an example of the supposedly
defunct “spoils system,” Gingrich awarded the job to one of
his political friends. It would appear that the conservative
trends in this nation are so reactionary as to want to return
the country to the 19th century.

As in the case of all appointments, this one should have
been well researched before so as to prevent ideologues from
bringing their radicalism to bear in positions of importance.
Gingrich’s one laudable act in this instance is that he
removed Jeffrey quickly. 3

Future House appointments, however, should be made only
when necessary. When these appointments are made, let the
screening process be one of qualifications and not one of
patronage.

The true meaning of King '5 dream .

need not
r e m i n d
you that it

has been 31
years since
Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther
King Jr.
delivered his
“I Have a
D r e a m ”
speech at the foot on the Lincoln
Memorial in Washington, D.C.,
and his vision has not come
true. Racism is as bad, and some
say worse, as it was then. The

Columnist
Rick Nowlin

Ku Klux Klan came back in the

1980s, and affirmative-action
programs have been challenged,
occasionally successfully, in the
courts. What’s worse, much of
the controversy is now taking
place outside the South, the tra-
ditional bastion of white racism.

Whatever happened to The
Dream?

I don’t think that American
society was really ready for it. I
know for sure that black
America wasn’t.

Now, before people get angry
with me, let me say that to refer
to Dr. King as simply a “civil-
rights leader” is to miss com-
pletely the impetus for what I
consider to be a work of God.
Remember, he was primarily a
Baptist minister, and his reli-
gious convictions shaped not
only his ideals but his strategy.
Furthermore, what we now call
the “civil-rights movement” (a

‘misnomer, I think) came from

revival meetings in black

churches in the South.

That’s important, because true
spiritual revival, at least in the
Christian sense, has less to do
with changing others than in
changing oneself. It’s so easy to
blame other people or “the sys-
tem” for their problems, but
while oppression exists, mainte-
nance of an unjust system
requires cooperation from
everyone involved.

However, noncooperation
with evil isn’t really about
ignoring a few laws; it's about
takingonanewmindsetthat,in

this case, invites enemies into a
new type of relationship which
is based on equity, fueled by
reconciliation and free from the
shackles of the past.

And that was the goal of
“nonviolent resistance.”

However, he also understood
one thing: That same system
enslaved whites as well. Racism
functions as a social addiction
based on fear that feeds upon
itself; in addition to degradation,
it also costs a lot of money.
Therefore, his real interest in
destroying “Jim Crow” in the
South was to free everyone.

Think I’m talking nonsense?
Here’s what he said to his “bit-
terest enemies”: “We shall
match your capacity to inflict
suffering by our capacity to
endure suffering. We shall
match your physical force with
soul force. Do to us what you
will, and we shall continue to
love you. We shall not cooperate
with your unjust laws, because
noncooperation with evil is
every bit as much a moral oblig-
ation as cooperation with good.
Throw us in jail, and we shall
still love you.

“Send yourihooded perpetra-
tors [that is, the KKK] of vio-
lence into our neighborhoods at
the midnight hour and beat us
and _leave us half dead, and we
shall still love you. But be ye
assured that we will wear you
down with our capacity to suf-
fer.

“One day we shall win free-
dom, but not only for ourselves.
We shall so appeal to your heart
and conscience that we shall
win you in the process, and then
our victory will be a double vic-
tory.”

That’s where the black com-
munity has missed the boat.
These days, its leaders talk
about “rights,” “justice” and
“diversity” but not “reconcilia-
tion.” Why is that word so
threatening? Perhaps it chal-
lenges their own notions of what
racism is and how to fight it.
Ironically, they have worked
with the very system they claim

to hate, and this may be the rea-
son that racism is still alive and
well.

Yet, I see evidence that The
Dream still lives.

In 1978, when Brashear High
School, which had opened three
years earlier amid considerable
racial strife, won its first
Pittsburgh City League football
championship, its white quarter-
back told his black teammates,
“I’m gonna party with you boys
on the Hill tonight.”

In 1985, my almost all-white
church had a black guest
preacher who, to the best of my
knowledge, was judged solely
on the content of his sennon.

In 1988, a white Chatham
College student sang black
gospel music in a choir during a
Christian student conference.
Her response: “This is treat!”

In 1989, a white Kansas
church asked for, and received,
forgiveness from a black church
for making conditions so into]-
erable 100 years ago for its
black parishioners that they had
to form their own church.

They all understood that The
Dream was about reuniting the
previously separated. The ulti-
mate goal of the Montgomery,
A1a., bus boycott of l955-56
was not just to allow blacks to
sit in the front‘ of the bus, or to
drive the bus, or even runthe
bus company, good as these
things may be. No, the real
meaning came forth when Dr.
King was able to sit on a bus
with the late Glen Smiley, a
white Montgomery minister.
You see, a law can force you to
admit me to school, give me a
job or even keep you from say-
ing racial slurs publicly.

But no law can force you to
love me. Only a relationship can
do that -— and without relation-
ships, justice is impossible.

And thats what The Dream is i

all about.

Oh, well, whatever, nevermind 
—— Kurt Cobain

It wasn’t supposed to happen like this.

There were albums to be made and col-
laborations in the works, and, goddammit,
I had never seen him live.

Hell, it was even Opening Day at Three
Rivers Stadium, a one-day reprieve from

the gloom and snow of winter. Rumors of 

Nirvana’s ‘break up had not been con-
firmed (though talk of the band's pulling
out of Lollapalooza had) and then, a few
hours after dawn, a Seattle electrician
stumbled upon the body, called a radio
station in Seattle and, just like that, Kurt
Cobain was a memory.

Kurt Cobain blew the back of his head
off, man. Play ball.

The networks took us onto his front
porch; Kurt Loder told us every hour on
the half hour that, yes, he was indeed
dead; radio stations played Nirvana well
into the night and MTV re-ran Nirvana’s
unplugged session in New York in a con-
ﬁnuousloop.

Courtney Love read his suicide note to a
flannel-burning mass at his Seattle memo-
rial, and a sickening picture of his body
lying next to his driver’s license and little
cigar box ran in People. The New York
Times tried to put him in his historical
place, and Andy Rooney and Rush
Limbaugh trashed him  something about
human debris.

The sales for In Utero jumped and
Bleach soared — curiosity as much as

interest. Three days after he was found, _

Love’s band Hole released the extremely
emotional Live Through This. Cobain’s
body was cremated.

“Fuck Kurt Cobain, I can’t get a job”
-Gregory Askew, a Seattle 20-year old as
quoted in Rolling Stone

“I take pride as the King of llliterature. 
-Kurt Cobain

The rock world has gone on.

The machinations of corporate rock con-
tinued in the days, weeks and months
since April 8, 1994, kicked off perhaps the
shittiest year in recent music history:
bands were signed, money was made,
records were sold, rock stars were vener-
ated — typical stuff. We the nai've hoped
that his suicide would temporarily shut
down music, but even Seattle indie Sub
Pop, Nirvana’s first label, still had its sixth
anniversary party the next night.

In the sick irony of it all, however, his
suicide brought out the media like nothing
else he had ever done — fitting, I guess,
for a man sickened by all of the unwanted
national attention. What we journalists call
a “news event” was covered by an older
generation — a generation that may-have
had only the vaguest inkling of his name
and occupation — almost to the extent
that they covered the death and burial of
Jacqueline Kennedy and Richard Nixon.
(Ironically, Cobain was listed among each

of the network’s roll call of fallen figure-
heads, right up there with George
Peppard, Jessica Tandy and Nixon —
quite unusual company for a man who
spat in the face of delineated authority.)

Of course, Cobain appeared on the
cover of Newsweek, People, Spin’ and
Rolling Stone, and the latter even issued a
book, released, coincidentally, just in time
for the holiday season. Love has appeared
on the cover of Rolling Stone and Spin
(twice), right next to promises that the final
days of Kurt Cobain lay inside.

As expected, the suicide sparked mass
consumption of the band’s four albums:
Bleach, their only LP on, Sub Pop; major-
label debut Nevermind; /ncesticide, a col-
lection of b-sides and rarities; and In Utero
—— their final album that shook up the rock
world. An audio version of their brilliant
performance in MTV’s Unplugged series,
including David Bowie, Meat Puppets and
Leadbelly covers and a pair of songs not
shown on the television presentation, sold
millions; and “Live, Tonight — Sold Out,” a
video collection of live performances and
interviews, was released a week after
Unplugged.

And with a log of work still unreleased,
Cobain’s legacy still holds promise months
after In Utero emblazoned itself upon the
musical spectrum — several tracks avail-
able only on bootlegs continue to spark
rumors of a final album.

Following his death, Michael Stipe con-
firmed that the two had talked about col-
laborating on material, giving fans just one
more reason to wonder what might have
been. Stipe included a song on recent
smash Monster that was dedicated to
Cobain, a long-time admirer of the work of
R.E.M. “Let Me In’’ is a beautifully garbled,
noise-infested track that ‘stands as one of
the best songs on the album. The title
track to Neil Young's Sleeps With Angels
is as beautifully haunting as R.E.M.’s, and
the title to Pisces lscariot, a collection of b-
sides from Smashing Pumpkins, is a direct
reference to “the sad, sensitive  Pisces
Jesus man,” a self-empathetic title Cobain
gave himself in his suicide note.

The Stinky Puffs, whose teen-aged lead
singer sang a tribute to Cobain at the Yo-
Yo a Go-Go in Washington state, played
with the surviving members of the band,
Krist Novoselic and David Grohl. And Fluff
just recently released a 7" dedicated to
Cobain, complete with a picture of him on
the record sleeve.

-Cobain page 10

1994, a bummer, another
Lollapolozer summer with nature’s
kids playing in the mud.

“I threw a piece of mudl”
Generation X and slacker are well
understood words; if I relate the
clothing combination of Doc
Marten-wearing and J. Crew-order-
ing, you know who was at

 ~ Woodstock ‘94. Generation X is in

vogue. American capitalism, ‘60s
déja vu, and the complete market-
ing to the Gap-buying stereotypes
were all the well-tuned features of
Woodstock. It was nothing about
music. One-hit-wonders (i.e.
Candlebox, Collective Soul, Blind
Melon et cetera) lack the criteria of
making untimely music. The sound-
track completely tastes and smells
like chicken, no spice. Most of the
bands released songs that were
already previous singles. lt’s like an
REM CD single -- live versions of
popular songs. The miss of the
year

At the time of the original
Woodstock, no one expected a
later generation would regret and

say, “That was so cool. I wish I was

there.” The essence of Woodstock
‘94iwas tainted‘ with Thurston
Howell l|l’s greed. No one was
allowed to bring their own food, fun-
neling money directly to one higher
source.

Hippies have been replaced by
the mudpeople, MTV will burn away
Hendrix’s flaming guitar for Billie
Joe’s mud-covered one, and
Greenpeace will know — we don’t
really recycle. In another 25 years
will big business contract another
Woodstock?

Woodstock 19. It doesn’t sound
right. I think it needs a better name.

“I was listening to that before it got
really popularI”

The music of 1994 was misfitted
by the death of Kurt Cobain and the
rise of once shoestring-budget
bands to the hall of fame of MTV’s
heavy rotation. We saw the rise of
an underachiever, Beck, with his
post-baby boomer anthem “Loser.”
Which made the lyrics, “|”m a loser
baby/so why don’t you kill me” a
universal tongue.

Also on alternative music totem
pole is Weezer. Their video for
“Buddy Holly” confirms the market
to the ‘70s children and that Spike
Jonze, also the director of Beastie
Boys’ “Sabotage,” is a_ genius.
Closer to home, Live, who is
Pennsylvania version of Pearl Jam,
released their second album,
“Throwing Copper.” The band’s pro-
gression from high school parties to
Woodstock’s limelight seems like a

    
 
  

Pol|yanna’s wet dream. Berke|ey’s
Green Day smashed their head on
the punk rock and went to a major
label. “Longview” sent the future
Lollapalooza moshers to the mall,
intent on hearing the words “fuck-
ing” and “masturbation”. The
screaming and emphasizing of
taboo words offer shock value, and
thanks to NIN and Henry Rollins it
makes money too.

Paul’s Nifty Ten
1. LILYS (spinART): “dandy”

- The Gypsies of indie rock. The
band has no continuity to its mem-
bers, except for Kurt Hisley (prima-
ry songwriter/guitarist/vocalist), who
has the ability to write perfect pop
songs.

2. ROCKETSHIP (s|umberIand):
“your new boyfriend/like a day-
dream” 4

- The ‘80s are completely over,
however the music can be heard
forever. Screw K—Tel! If you
escaped to the mall and searched
for any UK band (circa. 1980s),
Rocketship deserves a pitch.

3. SEBADOH (SubPop): “magnet’s
coil”

- Lou successfully tends to the
feelings of a man with lyrics like ‘‘I
don’t want you to be another mirror
of my fears.” ' ‘

4. THE PASTELS (Matador): “yoga”

- I want more Aggil ’

5. FLYING SAUCER ATTACK“

(Drag City): “soaring high”

- Whoever figured that staticky
AM noise would be in style?
6. NOISE ADDICTS
Royale): “| wish I was him”

- An expression of teen angst, a
tribute to Evan Dando and New
Zealand birthright qualifies this
acoustic pop tune. —
7. RODAN (Touch N
“Shinner”

- More power to the amps!
8. GUIDED BY VOICES (Matador):
“Tractor Rape Chain”

- Lo-fi music is a major compo-
nent of indie rock, these guys have
been recording on a boombox for-
ever.

9. PAVEMENT (Matador): “Gold
Soundz”

- Two-minute tunes work well,
especially with the savory talent of
Malkmus.

10. BAILTER SPACE (Matador):
..X..

- My Bloody Valentine’s essence
and over-spiraling guitar certify this
song to me. Another band acknowl-
edging that New Zealand might be
better than Portland or Seattle.

(Grand

Go):

-I swear to God! I am not a rep for
Matador Records!

spikes on their jackets, but it
all sounds pretty weak to
me.

5. Long live the king of rap
clichés and the flavor of the
month: Dr. Dre. The whole
Death Row sound is getting
a bit tiresome. Synclavier
and Moogs only go so far;
leave Parliment alone. Get
some diversity — I mean this
guy is supposed to be a cre-
ative genius of rap  yawn.
6. Sheryl Crow hit it big and
is nominated for a Grammy.
Her sound is  retro, rootsy,
and dull. Her writing is  l’|I
say this: mentioning beer,

V smoking and bars does not

win you the Tom Waits
bohemian credibility award

with me. I liked her better on ,

that Michael Jackson tour.

7. Birds of a feather stink
together! The Counting
Crows are another of those
rootsy bands that are just
plain annoying. Let’s see 
the singer has a cute alter-
nalook going and makes ref-
erences to Dylan and in gen-
eral must think of himself as
“deep.” Survey says:
Blechhhhhh. Of course, this
says nothing of his exagger-
ated vocal style.

8. What happened to
SoundGarden? I used to
kind of like them. Super
Unknown=Super Weak.
They were definitely better
when they ripped off
Sabbath instead of making
concept video songs like
Black Hole Sun.

9. I could write a book on
why I hate the band Live.
Talk about a guy who’s into
himself! Cripes-o-Mighty!!!
That Krishna looking dude
thinks he wrote the book on
self-introspection and the art
of being “deep!” He’s so dra-
matic, especially in the “I
alone” video it gives me
goose bumps. Oh, please 
what the hell is up with the
drummer in that video?? OK,
you have the singer hogging
up the camera with his con-
tortions and grimaces, the
bass and guitar players mov-
ing around with their
unplugged electric guitars
(cool effect), but what about
that drummer? Did they for-
get his snare drum; they
didn’t even give him sticks.
He just dances(!??), almost
trips, gets on the camera
and sings a lyric. I must say I
am embarassed for him, and
to top'it off the video con-
tains a spooky tree and a
snake. Oh, man.

10. My final gripe is directed
to two VJs. Idalis: love that
‘80s in the ‘90s look, keep it
upll John Sencio: Did you
really think that Woodstock
‘94 was beautiful and excit-
ing? It must be cool to be
you. Where do they hire
these people? What hap-
pened to Louis Largent?

Oh well, there you have it. I
know this list is far from com-

     

plete, but I haven't got any
time for anything but
Slacking and um, Fiea/ity

some of Kurt’s songs in con-

For many of us, the realiza-

realization that he’s gone. As
Unplugged videos are
released first “All
Apologies” then “About A Girl”
and now “The Man Who Sold
The World” — we are con-
stantly reminded of the
Thursday night about a year
ago when it was first aired. In
the freest, most unobstructed
moments, we can kind of
wonder who will be next in
line, the next to follow the
legacy of Lennon and Cobain.
What will he say? What will
she say?

Of course, nothing is

integrity is the exception and
commercialism is the rule,
how the fuck can we expect
anything but a exploitive bar-
rage of merchandising —— no
matter how good the Rolling

should, be held up as cashing
in. Unplugged was out by the
end of the year, and the video
was hot on its heels, all on the
same rack for your holiday
shopping. If anyone can stom-
ach the Kurt Cobain Death

’94 paraphernalia, the more

widow and the mother of his
little baby, was revolted -
she ripped a shirt with a pic-
ture of the frowning Cobain off
a shameless poseur after her
show in Pittsburgh, one in
which she threatened to kick
the hell out of a fan who stuck
his or her finger in her. lt’s all
become a big, ugly mess.

And the sad part is that it's
nothing less than the same
shit that sent Cobain into fits
of depression during his rise
to the top of the ridiculously
overblown Seattle scene —
people throwing his name
around as if we had any sem-
blance of his pain, physical or
otherwise. I miss him more.
No, I miss him more. Hell, |’m
guilty of it. You’re guilty of it.

Non-Fiction
Black Sheep
Polygram

Non-Fiction goes from
freestyle, improv, porch
stump, hip hop to eloquent,
finger-snappin’, jazz club
poetry. I was instantly
aroused by the “Non-Fiction
lntro” which has a silvery,
extra-terrestrial dance beat.
The “lntro” and “Outro” are
the highlights of the album.

Non-Fiction is an erratic
brew of obscure samples,
expressive lyrics and jazzy,
jazzy rhythm (sometimes a lit-
tle too jazzy). “B.B.S.” stirred
me up with sultry female
vocals and the pitter patter of
piano keys upheld by that
inevitable, pummeling, hip
hop sound. “Peace to the
Niggaz” is a little 10-cent life
lesson with a sluggish, drony
baste and chuckling lyrics like
“Now to the shorties in the
world/Listen up-that shit is just
TV/Far from reality/And half
the niggaz you see on TV/ are
frontin’/ they ain’t sayin’
nuthin’/so take yo’ little ass
somewhere and watch
Barney or somethin’.”

The lyrics make up for what
the music lacks. l was
extremely amused by “Who’s
Next,” a song about a woman
of all persuasions. This song
humorously chimes in with ‘‘I
had her/you had her/we had
her/he had her/she had
her/they had her/it seems that
yeraho’.” I can't recall the
melody because it was
drowned by me and my room-
mate's uncontrollable laugh-
ter. “We Boys” is an idiotic,
machismo, ego trip with a
D.C. go-go flair. “Without a
Doubt” is an obvious hit. Then

~ again, any song with an Isley

Brothers sample is an auto-
matic hit. “Gotta Get up” has a
pudgy baseline and a chafing
flutey‘ sound that clash with
Mista Lawnge’s crystal clear
verbalizing.

Non-Fiction has very little
“hit” potential due to its over
emphasized “jazz” sound and
songs like “City Lights,”- “Do
Your Thing” and “Let’s Get
Cozy" which is a tasteless
and coarse rendition of a sex-
ual episode that left a bad
taste in my mouth. I really
don't know what will become
of this album. It's not bad and
it’s not great. I think Black
Sheep's sound is a little out-
dated. They spent too much
time on the lyrics and the
wardrobe for the album cover
and not enough time on the
music and the overall sound.
Sure, there may be a few
motion-inducing sounds here
and there, but for 15 bucks,
that’s simply not enough.

Their best bet would have months. in the meantime, to a “Without A Doubt” single.

which
brought last
night’s Pitt-
UConn game
to a 10-point
differential,
and a rowdy
Fitzgerald
Field House
fell silent.

 

Columnist
Matt
Groff

UConn forward Rudy
Johnson had just slid down
the baseline for a reverse
layup. Before Johnson could
worry about getting back on
defense, teammate Doron
Sheffer was laying the ball
back in the hoop for two
more after a UConn steal off
Pitt’s slowing offense.

The crowd’s adrenalin
turned to gut-wrenching
worry at this point, which
would be a surprise in some
games, considering Pitt was
on the top end of the 10-
point difference. Especially
since the game, in which 13
minutes were left, was
nowhere near over.

However, this is a Pitt
team whose worst enemy is
the clock and its ability to
take the life out of their
uptempo style, not to men-
tion their seven scholarship
players.

When UConn broke the
10-point barrier seconds
later, it was in the midst of a
furious 44-l6 second-half
run which the Panthers could
do little to derail, and every-
one in the.Field House could
feel the slide. Pitt,which
had constructed a 25-point
lead by attacking the unde-
feated No. 2 UConn team in
thefirst half, was no longer
using its building blocks.

Pitt was no longer block-
ing shots, out—muscling the
Huskies on the boards or
zipping past them in transi-
tion. The Panthers were still
hustling to the ball, but the
quickness and execution
which was characteristic of
the game’s opening 15 min-
utes was nowhere to be
found.

Perhaps most noticably
missing was the confidence
and fire with which they
played the opening half. On
defense, Pitt had been play-
ing so well that the momen-
tum pushed its offense to its
most explosive level all ‘sea-
son —— 40 points in less than

1 For 32 minutes, 6,798 fans at

House sat on the edge of pan-
demonium waiting for the final
horn to sound to rush the
court.

Up by 25 points with 5:13
remaining in the first half, Pitt
had the undefeated No. 2
Connecticut Huskies backed in
the corner ready to land the
knockout blow. But in the end,
UConn weathered Pitt’s first
half blitzkrieg of three-point-
ers and spoiled the Panthers’
upset hopes last night, winning
85-76.

“No one has attacked us like
that the way Ralph Willard’s
team did tonight,” UConn
head coach Jim Calhoun said.
“We took some pretty big
shots in the early rounds, and
then we started to come on.”

Pitt (4-8, 0-4‘ in Big East
play) jumped out to a 16-4
lead in the first six minutes of
play, mostly due to a harassing
1-3-1 half court trap that dazed
the usually aggressive UConn
(ll-0, 4-0) squad. ,

The Panthers extended their
lead to 36-15 on Jason Maile’s
three-pointer, one- of 'six first-
half bombs, opposed to the
Huskies 0- for-8 half.

Pitt pounced to its largest

lead, 25, on Orlando Antigua’s
rimming shot in a crowd with
4:50 remaining. From then on,
UConn began to slice the lead
to an eventual- 15-point deficit,
45-30, after Pitt’s Jaime
Peterson, who scored a team-

high 18 points, grabbed 13
boards" and had six blocks,
nailed a pair of free throws
with no time remaining in the
first half.

One of the reasons for Pitt’s
first-half bulgewas it caused

16 UConn turnovers toqthe
Panthers’ 11. But as the seven-
man Pitt rotation began to

fatigue, the Panthers started 

turning the ball over with,re'g-
ularity —— ending _th-efgame
with 25 miscues, one more

than their season average.
“We did an excellent job

against West Virginia and Michigan this
Saturday night at 7 p.m.

“I couldn’t have asked for a better fall

Debbie Yohman said. “The kids‘ have-

really, really worked hard.”

Yohman enters her ninth season as the
head coach of the ,Pjtt' women’s _gymnas-

mer Pitt gymnast Meg Johns.

“We are real strong on beam and

Yohman said. “We are definitely

Leading the way for the squad is,

junior Brenda Stevens. Stevens is Pitt’s

t"No;..i‘fl1 all-arounder, and last year she rep-

resented Pitt at the NCAA Northeast
Regionals. V '

“Stevens” is the type of person who

will keep pushing and pushing, even

_ when she’s ‘hurt, and everyone else sees ,
that,” Yohman said. “She will be one of 7

Another gymnast the coaches hav-e‘~¥

Yard.

“Robyn looks tough in the
all-around,” Yohman said.
“Lori has been working hard.
She will be a better gymnast
this year.”

Juniors Christine Battista
and Deena Daller return to
the roster this season and are
ready to compete.

The newcomers to the team
are Bodnar, Kristin Bond,
Brown and Joy McElhinny,
from local Thomas Jefferson
High School.

“The freshmen are doing
a really good job,” Yohman
said. “Calli has a shoulder
problem i and is not
working bars, which is
her weak event, so we are
saving her for the other
events.”

“Kristin is doing what we
thought she would when she
got here,” Yohman said. “She
will be one of our top bar
scores.

“Joy is in the running for
any of the four events.

‘Tracey is coming off of an

ankle injury and will com-
pete exhibition on bars.”

Opening the season against
West Virginia and Michigan
is only the beginning of a
tough schedule for the Lady
Panthers.

“We are opening the season
with a very, very tough West
Virginia team and a Michigan
team that finished fourth in
the nation last season,”
Yohman said. “We are going
to take it meet by meet this
season. We have a tough
schedule. We don’t have any
sure wins.”

Yohman sounds as if she is
looking forward to a strong
season from this team.

“I want the team to stay
focused and disciplined
enough to do the best job that
they can do,” Yohman said.
“What I would like this team
to accomplish this year is
that some of those meets that
are possible wins, for us to
win them because we beat
that team and not to lose
them because we beat our-
selves.”'

happens to us in a lot of games
this year, we’re just wearing
down. I think we’re not just
wearing down physically, but
mentally.”

UConn came out firing in
the second half. Huskie guard
Doron Sheffer hit a three-
pointer to start the period. For
7:23, Pitt fought to keep a
double-digit lead, but the
inevitable finally happened on
Brian Fair’s slicing layup, cut-
ting the margin to eight, 55-
47.

After Rudy Johnson’s tip
and three-point play on a fast
break, coupled with a 21-9
run, UConn finally knotted the

. game at 60 with 8:39 left.

From then on, it was the Ray
Allen show. The 6—foot-5-inch
sophomore swingman slashed,
shot and dunked his way to a
game-high 27 points, and 12
of his 19 second-half points
came in the last nine minutes.

“Big-time players make big-
time plays, and Ray Allen is a
big-time player,” Calhoun

said.

The Panthers were kept in
the game by forward Chris
Gant’s relentless pursuit on the
boards. He snagged 15
rebounds, seven of which
were on the offensive end.

The lead swayed back and
forth, and at the 7:19 mark it
was again tied at 65 on Sotiris
Aggelou’s three-pointer,
which was followed by a tele-
vision timeout.

UConn smelled blood, and
Pitt came out ﬂat — dead ﬂat.

. An Antigua traveling violation

was cashed in by a Kirk King
layup, who started in the place
of a suspended Donny
Marshall.

After a Peterson hoop,
UConn went on an 18-9 run to
end the game. Allen buried a
three, then point guard Andre
Alridge fumbled the ball right
into Huskie center Pat
Knight’s hands for an easy
layin. Then Allen exploded to
the hole for another hoop, and
before a blink of an eye, Pitt
was trailing by seven with

It was academic after that — 

and if it wasn’t, Allen made
sure of it.

Two minutes and 19 seconds i

after the previous Pitt score,
Peterson tipped in a miss shot.
Then Allen buried another
three, and followed his scoring
barrage with a double-pump
dunk.

The story of the second half
was that the Panthers shot a
dismal 2—for-l6 from‘the
three-point arc and 27 percent
from the field, while UConn
shot a cool 60 percent.

“I guess we were satisfied
being up against the No. 2
team. We gave the game
away,” said Alridge, who
scored 14 points. “We just let
down on defense, and they
took advantage of it.

“Mentally, we broke down
and gave them easy buckets.
The second half we mentally
broke down, our focus was
gone. They [UConn] stepped
it up a notch, and we didn’t
step it up.”'

the best teams in the coun-
try. Even after they missed a
shot, Pitt players were bat-
tling for their own rebounds
and confidently putting the
ball up again, most of the
time sinking their shots or
getting fouled.

But when UConn started
cutting into the lead, first to
15 points and then to 10, you
could see Pitt’s confidence
eroding along with the lead.
Their fresh edge was going
dull with fatigue, and
UConn was eager to capital-
ize.

Though none of the Pitt
players would say so after
the game, the Field House
crowd witnessed why it is
nearly impossible for a team
with seven scholarship play-
ers to stay ahead of a team
with any real depth, let alone
UConn’s size, quickness and
athletic ability for 40 min-
utes.

“We didn’t do the things
we did in the first half,’’ an
anguished Jaime Peterson
said after the game.

When asked if it was
fatigue and pressure to pick
up the slack when the team’s
shooters had gone cold, he
quickly answered.

“No, it was a mental
breakdown. This game is 90
percent mental, and we just
weren’t moving the ball like
we knew how. If we
would’ve continued to play
like we did in the first half,
we would’ve won. Easily.”

Pitt head coach Ralph
Willard said even though the
team was making mental
errors, a major part of the
loss was fatigue.
