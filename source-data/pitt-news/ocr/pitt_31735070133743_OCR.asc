Raising the ar since 1906

VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 113

Asian Student Alliance

"GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

The Asian Student Alliance is

now the eighth student group in the

history of the University of Pittsburgh
to obtain ‘governance status.

" Dr. Jack, Daniel, Pitt’s vice
provost and interim dean of students,
granted the status on Friday, two
years following ASA’s initial request.

Governance status allows certain
umbrella organizations, such as Black
Action Society and the Panhellenic
Association, to apply’ for much larger
budgets from the Student Government
Board and it grants themrecognition
and prestige as among the most inﬂu-
ential groups on campus. . ‘

According to Daniel, one of the

A reasons that it took so long for the

University to respond to ASA’s

» request was that it has been some time

since a group requested governance

status. A

_ . “I don’t thinka governance group

had been approved in. decades,”

Daniel said. I ' -
Consequently, ‘Daniel and other

administrators within the University
' decided that a new standard for deter-

mining which groups can achieve
governance status was needed.
“When I came aboard in
September, I asked for clarification
about all of the guidelines about what
is ‘a government group and a gover-

. nance group,” Daniel "said.

Those guidelines were prepared
last year by Daniel’s predecessor,

- Sharon Johnson, largely in response

to the confusion caused by ASA’s’

I application.

“There haven’t been clear guide-

lines, policies and procedures,”
. -Daniel said.

ASA’s application was aided by a
recommendation that SGB wrote in
its favor last spring. SGB member
Kevin Washo said that the application
process was a “new experience” for
everyone involved. ’

“There hasn’t really been a trend
with alot of groups looking to be
governance groups,” Washosaid.

Both Daniel and ASA President
George Ayub credited SGB’s recom-

      gets governance status

mendation as a major factor in the
success of the. governance applica-
tion.

year, we wouldn’t have gotten gover-
nance,” Ayub said.

The proposed budget for ASA,
which began in 1993 as the Asian
Student Association and now encom-
passes many smaller Asian student
groups, was about $23,000, according
to Ayub.

“It means we can reach out to
more Asian students,” Ayub said. “It
means better access to resources for
our members, it means more funding

for programs for Asian students.”

ASA’s application cited underrep-
resentation as the main problem\ that
the organization would address.
According to the application, Asian
studentsmake up 4.5 percent of Pitt’s
student body. V ‘

“We can institute programs to
help integrate Asian students into the
mainstream even more,” Ayub said.

With the amount of money avail-
able to governance groups so large,
Daniel said that SGB needs a new a
set of parameters to determine which
groups they will recommend in the
future, so that they “[do] not leave
themselves on an ad hoc basis.” He
said that he had formally asked SGB
President Jeff Alex to develop stan-
dards for future groups seeking gov-
ernance. ' _

“I’ve asked him and his people to
develop fonnal criteria  and to for-
ward those to me,” Daniel said.

He said that one of the most
important parts of the governance
application ‘process was SGB’s
involvement as a voice for the student
body.

‘‘It’s not something that I select or
[Director of Student Activities] Joe
Cavalla selects,” Daniel said. “It’s

something that came from the stu-

dents.” A .

With new procedures and guide-
lines prepared, Daniel said that he felt
that ASA met all of the requirements
for governance. ..

“I didn’t think it was fair to pro-
long it because of my interim status,”

“Without SGB support from last

Jackie Kay’s Highland lilt

Staff Writer

Jackie Kay was an unusual sight in

her childhood hometown. Born half.

Nigerian and half Highland'Scottish and
adopted by a white family in Glasgow,
Scotland, Kay’s cocoa tinted skin set

her.

Now Kay writes poetry and repre-
sents other people who fall on the mar-
gins of society; people who feel they
don’t ﬁt in. She has published collec-
tions of poems dealing with such
themes as adoption, identity and les-
bianism, as well as books of poetry for

children.
On Thursday, Kay gave a poetry

/‘reading in 501 of the Cathedral of
Learning. The poems were punctuated

with sighs and laughter as Kay guided
her audience through a series of emo-
tions in her strong Highland accent.

Kay encouraged the audience to lis-
ten to the poetry and actively think
about it. At the same time, she empha-
sized the importance of just enjoying
the music of it all, comparing listening
to poetry to listening to music.

“Don’t worry about the meaning

too much,” she said. “Just listen to the‘?

Marianne Novy, the faculty mem- -

helped to set up the visit, talked about
the reason for having Kay read to stu-
dents. ~ ’

“It’s so important for students to see
that poets are real live people,” Novy
said. “[Jackie Kay] represents so many

get expressed in poetry.” V

One of the reasons that these vari-

Because black role models were
rare in her daily life, Kay looked to
black American women such as Bessie
Smith and Angela Davis. 

She read a poem at one point in the
night written about the memory of
Bessie Smith, titled “The ,Red
Graveyar .” "

“There are stones that shake and
weep in the hot night, down in the
graveyard where Bessie haunts her
lovers.”

poetry or prose one day, Kay offered

Champagne, an ice sculpture, and
traditional libations all made appearances
at the ﬁrst Ujima Awards Brunch held at
the Pittsburgh Athletic Association on
Saturday morning. The ceremony pre-

sented awards to local teachers, lawyers

and companies for their support of and

contributions to diversity and equality.
Pitt School of Law’s Black Law

Students Association organized the event.

“In the past, we had honored other '

people in the community. This year we
decided to take it to another love ,” said
Jacquelyn Omotalade, chair of the
brunch committee.

One highlight included a West

2 African drum and dance presentation by

ReSunSum, a performance group, while
about 100 sharply dressed attendees nib-
bled on apple crepes and poached
Atlantic salmon. -

A post.-Olympic evaluation

Last night marked 17 days since the
Rice Eccles Olympic Stadium hosted the
Opening Ceremonies. Three and a half bil-
lion people worldwide watched the event
with all its pageantry, music and patriotism.
It had been a long haul coming —— from an
embarrassing bidding scandal to slow ticket
sales and security anxieties. Yet the amazing
execution of the Opening Ceremonies wel-
comed the world to Utah and promised an
exciting two weeks of Olympic competition.

Inthe days since, the Olympics have
dished out a wild mix of triumph and disap-
pointment Here’s The Pitt: News’ conven-
tional wisdom on the Olympic highs and
lows.

Sportscasters: § No one expected
unbiased journalism from American com-
mentators, many of whom are former
Olympians and still highly connected to their
sports and the current Olympians. But,
somehow, we didn’t expect them to forget
who the judges were —— not them.

Curling: & Public attention surged for
this sport ... which is basically shuﬁleboard
on ice with brooms.

Media Coverage: § Around-the-
clock coverage for everything from curling
to hockey was available, with television rat-
ings rising by nearly 20 percent. But
American journalists are being blamed for
creating a so-called North American bias by

pressuring judges to favor North American
athletes, thus causing high medal counts for
the United States and Canada. According to
The New York Times, one South Korean
skating coach even went so far as to say,
“American journalists only print lies.”

Judging: | Every day following the
disgraceful Russian pairs skating gold saw
some contest for question. Russians and_
South Koreans even threatened to withdraw
from the Olympics as a result of what they
called unfair judging. The International
Olympic Committee should look into some
judging regulations or it could be looking
down the path to even more divisive
Olympics. What happened to a little friendly
national competition?

Commercialism: With ultra-
short commercials in the men’s hockey
game, one couldn’t miss the commercial
omnipresence. From T-slnits to pins and
patches, you can buy your piece of Olympic
history. Berets like the ones worn by U.S.
athletes in the Opening Ceremonies can
even be purchased online.

Diversity: 9' With the ﬁrst black ath-
lete — Vonetta Flowers from women’s bob-
sledding — to win a gold medal in the
Winter Games and the growing inclusion of
women’s sports, diversity was on the rise
this Olympic season. Even a greater range of
sports. saw prime time coverage.

speaking out against apartheid, I did-
n’t even bother looking up what the
word meant. I was in no position to

not sure how much I really did manage to get
out of the American bubble.

Traveling is great fun, but it will also
change you if you allow it to. For me, the adven-
ture was more than going where I didn’t quite fit
in — that was how it was at home too! But there
were times, walking into some village in Africa
where nobody spoke my language or remotely
cared about my culture ~— or alone for a day in
some tropical jungle -— when I experienced
what was for me a new feeling: I was complete-
ly irrelevant. This was frightening, depressing 
and yet somehow thrilling and liberating.

I was deeply inﬂuenced by my later experi-
ences as a doctor volunteering in poor countries
around the world. Many of these societies seem
to be rushing headlong in the wrong direction.
Billions of people live in deplorable and often

deteriorating conditions, while the natural envi-

ronment gets trashed and converted into cash as
soon as someone can figure out how to do it. A
doctor might feel like Sisyphus, treating an end-
less stream of sick people, while the real forces
making them ill go unchecked. (A doctor could
also feel that way in this country, but that’s
another story.) I «

I wish that we could say that America is a-

force for positive change in the developing
world, but spending on foreign aid is less than

we might like to think, and our conduct and .
- policies in many cases only make things worse.

I’m not sure how much I can do about any of

‘Emancipation Proclamation is signed, when the

this, but lately I’m trying to find out.

For me, global civics is a lifetime process of
deepening my understanding, widening the cir-
cle of my compassion, and nurturing my abili-
ties to do good things. Now it’s midterm for me
already, and I- find myself wondering how I'°am
doing. ._ ’

Well, let’s see. As a starting point, I try not
to do things that harm others if I can help it. For
example, I have been vegan for 22 years. I’m
still not done learning, though, how to be good
to myself and to those around me, and I’m still
trying to become more aware of and responsive
to the wider world. Maybe most importantly,
I’m still having a pretty good time.

- I believe our species as a whole is also
undergoing an education. It may be hard to
imagine breakthroughs and revolutions before
they happen, but we are the fingers with which
humanity is groping its way forward. It’s up to
today’s students to figure out what they care
about and how they can work toward what they
believe in, both by taking action now and by
empowering themselves for the future.

I have learned this much: when the next

next apartheid system is dismantled, when the
next Berlin Wall comes down, I don’t want it to

happen before I at least look up what the words

mean.

“Know thyself” — Socrates

PAGE 8

\

Jeep Jaitlas self-portraits have included images of himself as an old man, as well

as images of his sister.

" f . Pnoros counrssy J ASDEEP J AITLA

CMU art major discovers himself in his artwork    

MARIAH MOORE
The Pitt News

“I’m ready to talk about me and that’s
for sure,” said Jasdeep Jaitla as he sat
down in front of a computer showing a
screen saver of his bearded face.
Although Jaitla has never spoken forrnal-
ly about himself and his self-portraits, he
is deﬁnitely not a stranger to the art of
introspection. . ,

At 26, Jaitla, a senior art major at
Carnegie Mellon University, has done
many interpretations of himself since he
was a freshman, but that was not always
the case. When Jaitla arrived at the uni-
versity in 1995, he hadn’t really taken on
art before, let alone portraiture.

After receiving a self-portrait assign-
ment from CMU professor Herb Olds,
Jaitla said his ﬁrst self-portrait was so
“horrible” that Olds would not even dis-
cuss it in class. The drawing ——- the head
and shoulders of an eyeless ﬁgure with
only the distinctions of glasses, facial hair
and a turban ——- was “... almost car-
toony,” Jaitla said. He continued, “I used
Xerox copy paper, a number two pencil,
drew right in the middle of the page [and]
there was no contrast ...”

Jaitla admitted that when he was
younger, he did not know the language of

art, but as he talked he stood over scrolls -

of self-portraits in his hallway and it was
obvious that he has now not only_learned
it, but made it his own. '

Standing inside his modest apart-.
ment, the artist unrolled drawing after.
drawing — done with black charcoal on
huge white sketch sheets — and he
revealed many different angles of him-
self. One was of Jaitla turned to the side,
looking pensive with his hair draped over
his face. In another he screams at the
viewer with raised eyebrows and a
gnarled beard. Still others are much more
elaborate. One portrays Jaitla in the garb
of Jesus but wearing his turban as he
makes the sign of communion, and anoth-
er is of his reﬂection through a bottle of
water where his face and hands are gross-
ly distorted.

But these were the portraits he did
before he quit school for three years. As
his last self-portrait during that time, Jaitla
drew two ﬁgures, one over the other —-
one is screaming with his eyes pressed
shut while the other stares blankly, with
only vacant eye sockets.

J aitla returned to CMU last
September after some “self discovery,”
and his latest self-portraits have taken the
form of sculptures. Jaitla’s sculptures say
more than even his sketches do, and they

 

also hint at the conﬂict presentiin his last
sketch. A
Two of his sculptures are rife with

self-reﬂection. One is of a wooden choir

stage with clay pieces painted as ﬁgures,
representing the children in his third
grade class.

“I stood out,” Jaitla said of the. inci-
dent with which the work is concerned,
“not only did I look diﬂ’erent than every-
body with [my] dark skin, but I was wear-
ing a dark blue suit.” The piece is about
being different, but also “being part of a
whole,” Jaitla said. He did not want “to
say too muc ” about his piece.

“I like people to have their own inter-
pretations,” he said.

Another piece is also on the same
theme, but on a subconscious level. J aitla

-created a clay bust of himself sleeping on

a black box, inside of which is a relief of
his 9-year-old self — torn on a wall.
When J aitla was in third grade, his teacher

ridiculed his turban.

“The whole class then turned away
from me,” said Jaitla, who is Sheik.

He remarked, “a friend noticed the
tear [in the work] stopped at the turban.”

Standing with Jaitla among his self-
portraits — his sketches, his sculptures
and even photos of his art, “Who is this
person?” seemed appropriate to ask. What

would one think of J aitla? Perhaps that he
has much to unravel? Upon-meeting. him,

one sees a person with a slender build,-

golden brown skin and waist-long black
hair, but through his self-portraits, much
more can be learned.

Jaitla himself provided a reason for
doing self-portraits: “to ﬁnd out what
other people think we think of ourselves.”

{Jaitla will have hisnﬁrst art opening,
showing his self-portraits April 12 at the
Frame on CM U is‘ campus. _ .

Students encouraged
to explore the
city with ‘Little

Black Book’

_ HEATHER BowLAN &
GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Report

From time to time, we’ve all thought
it: There’s nothing to do in Pittsburgh.

Some of us say it nearly every week-
end. But now, thanks to some smart mar-
keting, there’s no ‘reason to believe it.
There’s plenty to do in Pittsburgh, and
most of it is listed in one pocket—sized
resource guide.

“Little Black Book,” a small, stylish
and fairly comprehensive book distributed
by the Freedom Mentoring and
Leadership Development Project, an orga-
nization thatifocuses on retaining students
at Pitt, was designed in response to stu-
dents, ‘often from the Washington or
Philadelphia area, complaining about the
lack of activities

Perhaps the best feature of “Little
Black Book” is that every listing includes
the Port Authority Transit bus routes that
will get you there and PAI"s phone num-
ber is listed in the front of the guide. This
is essential information for students just
learning the bus routes and reluctant to
venture outside of

about town. Oakland;

“The goal of An additional
Freedom is the “ ..’. One Of the incentive is the

Freedom President

“And one of the
main reasons ‘stu-

resource guides out there, but they wanted
to create one that was practical (hence the
small size — perfect -for a purseor cargo
pocket) and student—tested; all of the estab-
lishments listed come recommended by
students.

Freedom printed 1,000 copies of the
book, which is available for free at the
Student Organization Resource Center, the

lishments listed ‘in

Oal<land—area busi-
nesses.

Proceeds from
the card will go to
establish the
Freedom Meal and Book Fund, an endow-
ment the group plans to create to help
underprivileged students pay for board
and books. .

“We were going to raise money that
was for Freedom,” Flint said, “but it turned
out that there was a bigger issue here and
that there were disadvantaged students
who couldn’t afford meals or boo 0.”

students and $5 for '

the fund, which the group plans to do
through grants, more fund-raisers and the
expansion of the Little Black Card.

“We want to have the ftmd established
by next year,” Bryant said.

Freedom is counting on the Little
Black Card to be a large source of money
for that fund, and they have already started

working on it. ~

“[More stores] are going to work us
into the budget next year,” said Julia
Wilson, the business manager of Freedom.
“We have a list of about 30 stores right
now [that give discounts].”

Businesses do not pay to have their
names in the book, so Freedom feels that
they should be willing to offer discounts in

exchange for the ﬂee advertising.

The Eat’n Park in Squirrel Hill is one
of the establishments that offers the dis-
count.

“Because we have so many college
people here, we wanted offer something
speciﬁcally to them,” said manager Carrie
Zickesoose, who added that since the card
ﬁrst started circulating almost two weeks
ago, about 10 students a day have been
using it at the restaurant.

Like any resource guide, “Little Black
Book” does not list every business or
venue that might appeal to students. For
example, in the “Cinemas and Theatres”
section, no playhouses are listed, and
Tom’s Diner on the South Side is conspic-
uously absent from the “Late Night
Eateries” section of the dining guide.
Despite these discrepancies, the book also
provides practical information on ﬁnancial
institutions, markets and health care
providers along with its entertainment list-
ings.

So the next time you ﬁnd yourself
playing Snood on a Saturday night, pick
up a copy of “Little Black Book” and ﬂip
through — chances are you’ll ﬁnd a better
way to spend your time and get some
human interaction while you’re doing it.

Pitt claims its sixth consecutive
Big East championship title

DON NGUYEN
Staff Writer

The Panther swimming team traveled to
the Big East championships to place the
crown on what has been a wildly successful
season. An undefeated mark (7-1 overall, 5-
0 Big East) in the conference schedule creat-
ed expectations for the season-ending cham-
pionship that demanded nothing ‘short of a
toumament victory.

Over the course of the championship,
which ran from Feb. 21-23 in Long Island,
NY., the Panthers accmnulated a whopping
319 points more than second place Rutgers.

There hasn’t been a ﬁrst and second place

differential this large since the formation of
the Big East conference in 1980.

The 200-meter freestyle medley team of
Mike Gmbe, Adam Webber, Max von
Bodungen and Miah Heath started the
Panthers’ quest for their sixth consecutive
Big East title by breaking the year-old meet
and team record with a time of 1 minute,
19.57 seconds. This mark was .05 seconds

Lirnkernann continued the Panthers’ record-
breaking pace when he won his second

career Big East title in the 500 freestyle. The .

4:23.26 time in the ﬁnals broke the school
record, which he set earlier in his career.

“Their attention to detail in the last two
months of the training season positioned
each of them to perform at their best,” said
head coach Chuck Knoles, who was named
the Big East Coach of the Year for his sixth
time. “I can say that this was one of the most
unbelievable team perfonnances I have ever
seen.”

Because of the increased point totals of-
the relays, dominance of these events is per-
tinent to sustaining a lead on the competition.

The Panthers went on to win four out of
the ﬁve relays at the Big East championship.

Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s basketball team collected its eighth vic-
tory of the season with a 68-53 win over Seton Hall, keep-
ing its chances alive for the Big East Tournament.

The Panthers improved to 8-18 overall and 3-12 in the
Big East, while Seton Hall dropped to the .500markwith an
overall record of 13-13 and 5-10 in the Big East .

“I’m just happy that we got a win because we haven’t
had one for a while,” head coach Traci Waites said “That is
the best basketball that we have played and won.”

Seton Hall quickly jumped out to a 2-0 lead, which was
followed by 10 unanswered points by the Panthers.

Alter senior center Bettina Love scored the Panthers’
10th point, the Pirates went on a 14-7 run, which put them
ahead by one.

The score would continue to ﬂip-ﬂop until junior guard
Brooke Stewart drained a three-pointer to give Pitt a 25-21
lead in the closing minute of the ﬁrst half. Stewart ﬁnished
the game with ﬁve points. The Panthers’ went into the lock-
erroomathalftime with a25-23 lead.

The Panthers and Pirates exchanged the lead four dif-
ferent times throughout the game as the Pirates came out in

the second half and quickly put four points on the board to
take a 27-25 lead'The Panthers regained the lead on a Haley

' Murray layup, putting ﬂie Pirates back on top by ‘one.

Following two Love free throws, the Panthers went on
to blow the game wide open with a 13-4 runin which Love
and freshman center Allisha Morris each made two layups.
Selwyn joined the fray with a layup of her own and Harguth
hit a three-pointer. The Panthers’ biggest lead of the after-
noon was 20. ’ «

Love and senior guard Jessica.Ryndycz played in their
ﬁnal home game at Pitt. Love was the Panthers’ second lead-
ing scorer with 16 points in her ﬁnal game at the Field
House. 5 _

“It was meaningful for me because my parents were
here and it was a great game,” Love said “It is something
thatwillbe specialtomefortherestofmy life.”

Junior guard Laine Selwyn led the Panthers in scoring
with 19 points and also contributed nine rebounds. Harguth
added 13 points for the game.

“We deﬁnitely did it for our seniors who have con-
tributed so much,” Selwyn said « ’

The Panthers were outrebounded 44-36 and this is an
area that Waites said she would like to see an improvement

in as the Panthers close out the season. I
Selwyn, who is listed at 5 feet 7 inches, led the team
with nine rebounds against the Pirates and is now the teams’
leader among active players with an average of 5.8
rebounds. Junior Center Mandy VV1ttenmyer led the team
with an average of 7.1 rebounds before going down with a

leg injury. ~ V

The game marked the ﬁnal women’s basketball game to .\

be played at Fitzgerald Field House. ‘ - t . “

’ “I have talked about how muchvwe  our‘

seniors,” Waites said ‘They obviously won’t get a chance to
play in the Petersen Center and I think our kids rallied

around our seniors. I would have to‘ saythat is why we"

played ajlot harder because they didn’t want to lose.’’‘* ~ A _
VV1th Pitt’s victory over Seton Hall, it can possibly gain

an invitation to the Big East Toumament. The Panthers’ torn‘-j ' _ i
nament hopes rest on Georgetown losing to both Seton‘Hall I

and Notre Dame. The Panthers also must win at Providence.
“I think this is what we needed,” Selwyn said. “We
needed a conﬁdence booster and just knowing that we have

a chance to go to the Big East Tournament and not going last .

year; we are just really excited”

The Panthers will play at Providence tomorrow.'Tip-oﬂ’

* THE PITT NEWS

2002 Winter Olympics
was oneto forget about

The Olympics ended last night and it
wasn’t soon enough for me.

Athletes: I hope you’ve packed up
your skis, bobsleds and curl-  V

ing scandal.
Or should I say ﬁrst skating scandal?

Before American speed skater Apolo _
Anton Ohno ever even

 

ing stones and gotten out of
Utah by now. VV1th any luck,
some of you could still be
proud to call yourselves
Olympians come tomorrow.
But who knows? Maybe
a few more scandals will
break out inthe coming days
or weeks to implicate anyone



   

stepped on the ice in Salt
Lake City, he had been
accused of ﬁxing a race. Ever
since, he’s been mired in con-
troversy.

During the ﬁnals of the
1,000-meter race, he was in
the lead with only a few
meters to go when he collid-

3

 

and everyone who was in sponfs vlgw ed with the other skaters and

Salt Lake City for the games.
I mean, honestly, what
are the 2002 games going to

Shaun Grifﬁn

he went down. Australian
Steven Bradbury, who was in
lastat that point, was the only

be remembered for? Belarus’
men’s' hockey team beating Sweden? It
was quite possibly a bigger upset than
when the United States beat the Soviets at
the 1980 games. ‘ .
’ It’s doubtful.

' More likely, these games will be
remembered as a blatant example of the
evil that pulses through sports these days.

I was a little surprised the apocalypse
didn’t break out at_ last night’s Closing
Ceremonies. I was just waiting for Satan
to burst out of the Olympic ﬂame with a
certain French judge at his side, laughing
and raining hellﬁre down upon us all.

That would have seemed a truly ﬁt-
ting end to these atrocious games.

We should’ve known from the day
the first scandal broke '—— that
International Olympic Committee ofﬁ-
cials accepted bribes ir1 exchange for
granting Salt Lake City the games.

These games were hazy well before
the ﬁrst gun was ever shot (starting gun,
that is) or first slope ever skied.

It started for me during the Opening
Ceremonies. Bob Costas was nothing
short of ajackass during the introductions
of the teams. -I wondered -sometimes how
he thought his responses were appropriate

like when he made fun of what the ~
. ' Mongolians were wearing.

Maybe it wouldn’t have been such a _
'bad thing for \&nce.McMahon to have

kicked Costas’ ass durir.1grthat_ interview
back when the XFL  still around.

Of course, , after that came
“Skategate.” ; . . .

I Now, I: didn’t; actually see Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier’s last routine, so I
donft knowhow much better it was than
the Russians’, butl certainly got my ﬁll of
the ‘story. over thenext week.

The whole scenario was so wrong
and ridiculous, and what was worse was
that it overshadowed so many other great
stories at the Olympics. There have been
some great stories at the games, like that
of the Shea family, but who knows how
many were passed over thanks to the skat-

“ skater not to fall, and he
crossed the line and won gold. Ohno
crawled in for silver.

There was a push for a re-race, but it
was shut down by the person in charge, a
judge from Australia.

Then in the 1,500, Ohno took second
again, but was soon given gold because it
was ruled that South Korean Kim Dong-
Sung pushed Ohno. Dong-Sung was dis-
qualiﬁed.

Later on in the week, it was Ohno
who was disqualiﬁed in the 500 semiﬁ-
nals for bumping another skater. That
same night, Ohno’s relay was involved in
a crash, and they took fourth.

Ohno didn’t run a clean race during
the games. Sometimes, it was his fault
and sometimes the other racers’. You
could even fault the nature of the sport
itself. .

But none of ‘it was clean, and nothing
Ohno did should be remembered too
fondly.

Gretzky, the best hockey player ever and
who I thought was one of the sport’s best
spokesman, degraded himself with some
unsubstantiated claims that Canada was-
n’t getting any respect at the Olympics.
Spain’s Johann Muehlegg, who won
three cross country skiing golds, has test-
ed positive for a harmed substance. He
has been stripped of at least one of those
so far.
Russia has caused all sorts of prob-
lerns.
Was there something in the water in
Utah? A -
Oh I don’t care anymore. I’m just

glad these games are over. I’m sorry I

watched any of it.

Now I can get back to sports where I,

expect corruption, like in baseball.
Ahh, good ol’ baseball corruption -. ..

Shaun Griﬁin is a columnist for The Pitt-

News. He thinks Satan showing up at the
Closing Ceremonies would ’ve given NBC
some really good ratings.
