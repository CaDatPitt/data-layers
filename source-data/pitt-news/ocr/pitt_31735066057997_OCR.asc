Heinz speaks out on elections

By Mark Gordon

News Assistant

One out of three American
people do not trust the
American government to do
what is right, according to
Teresa Heinz.

Heinz, the soft—spoken wife
of the late Pennsylvania sena-
tor, John Heinz, spoke at a
lecture presented by the
University Honors College
and the American Experience
Thursday night at Benedum
Auditorium.

“It is indeed gratifying to
see someone do more then
serve their own interest
today,” said Robert Hazo, the
director of the American
Experience about Heinz.

Heinz’s lecture, “Leading
Amid Chaos,” focused on the

political situation in
Washington, D.C. and the cur-
rent senatorial race in
Pennsylvania.

“It is fitting that we discuss
politics, with the election
coming up,” Heinz said.
“Today we seem to dread pol-

itics and the people who work
in Washington, D.C.”

Heinz said something has to
be done to change the resent-
ment people have for the gov-
ernment.

“Democracy is a great privi-
lege. If the government is
ignoring us, it is because we
let them,” Heinz said.

One reason Heinz values
democracy so much is that
when she was growing up she
did not have it.

“I grew up in East Africa, in
a dictatorship,” she said. “I

Manley gets engkineers $3.54 million

By Anthonylfreznican
For The Pitt News

Thanks to John Manley, the engineering
department of University of Pittsburgh will
receive a $3.54 million grant from the U.S.
Navy to deliver a master of science degree
program to the J ohnstown campus.

Manley is the director of this program
which not only assists students who are prac-
ticing engineers to receive their master’s
degree, but also helps to solve various prob-
lems in the manufacturing industry.

“Every student has to do a master of sci-
ence thesis in a manufacturing company or
manufacturing-related organization and solve
an actual applied problem for that company,”
Manley said. “To the best of my knowledge,
this is a first for a whole degree program at
Pitt."

Manley, a professor of industrial engineer-
ing, also teaches an undergraduate course in

engineering economic analysis and two grad-
uate courses in the manufacturing system
engineering program.

Manley said he got into teaching acciden-
tally while in the Air Force when he graduat-
ed first in his class from the school of
advanced navigator/bombardier training.

“What they told me was that the higher you
were in your class, the better choice of the
assignment you got when you graduated from
the school. What they didn’t tell me was
every now and then they took the first one or
two [students] in the class and kept them as
instructors,” Manley said.

Afterwards, Manley came back to get
his master’s degree from Pitt, and after
five more years in the Air Force, he came
back to Pitt again in Industrial Engineering
and operations research and received his
Ph.D.

“It’s never too late to go back for your

was fortunate enough to spend
time with my father, a doctor,
in clinics where I learned the
importance of the environ-
ment and dependable health
care.”

Heinz spoke about how
political campaigns have been
run recently.

“We are witnessing in the
current political races not how
to move our country forward.
but a contest between parties,”
she said. “Negative political
campaigns are dangerous.

Second open-

forum empty
once again

By Brian Estadt
Staff Writer

All of two people showed
up Thursday for an open
forum held by the committee
designated to find Pitt’s next
senior vice chancellor for
health sciences.

Committee chair Mark
Nordenberg was disappointed
at the low turnout for the
meeting, which was intended
to give students and faculty a
chance to voice their opinions.

“We’re glad we provided
the opportunity for people to
speak out,” he said, “but
we’re disappointed that more
people didn’t take advantage
of it.”

Thursday’s forum was the
second of two the committee
held. The first took place on

Oct. 20, with only two people.

attending it as well.

Lacking a crowd in the
William Pitt Union ballroom,
the committee listened to the
concerns of two faculty mem-
bers from the health sciences.

Dr. Thomas Zullo, a profes-
sor from the School of Dental
Medicine, said he felt there
may be difficulty in attracting
qualified candidates for the
job.

When asked by Nordenberg
what qualities he would like
the new senior vice chancellor
to have, Zullo said he would
prefer someone with a strong
background of success in
research to get the position.
He also said the person should
have sound administrative
skills.

Zullo said he would like to
see changes in the process of
tenure that medical faculty
must go through as well.

The position of senior vice
chancellor for the medical sci-
ences is an additional hurdle

WASHINGTON — The U.S.

Nationality

Rooms 

Adding character to Pitt

By Anna Katselas
and Alicia Curran
The Pitt News

According to Ray Rotuna,
“It’s fun to have class in a room
that is not just four walls, a
desk, and a blackboar .”

This opinion, echoed across
Pitt’s campus,
shows how
many students
feel about the
N a ti o n a l i t y
Rooms. Unlike
many of the
rooms in the
Cathedral of
Learning, the
N a ti o n a l i t y
Rooms are
diverse in style
and history.
With the earliest
rooms built in
1938 and the
latest in 1990,
they are a large
part of a long '
tradition at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The Cathedral of Learning
was built between 1926 and
1937 by former Pitt Chancellor
John Bowman, who wanted to
distinguish the university from
other parts of the city.

degree,” Manley said.

Manley taught at the
University of Maryland and
George Washington
University before retiring
from the Air Force in 1976
after 20 years of service.

From there he taught at
The John Hopkins
University and the Graduate
School of Industrial

Administration at Carnegie ’

Mellon Univesity before
coming to Pitt in 1987.

Aside from teaching,
Manley has consulting roles
not only in industry, but also
with the government on the
National Research Council.

“The essence of it all is
what I learned in the aero-
space industry which I’ve
been in primarily most of
my life,” Manley said.

Manley said the most sat-
isfying thing about teaching
is when a student learns
something new.

“I really enjoy when a stu-
dent all of the sudden gets
the expression that they’ve
finally learned something
that was complicated that
they obviously didn’t know
before,” Manley said.

“I like to see people
grow.”

Manley and his wife,
Josie, recently celebrated
their 36th wedding
anniversary. They have four
children and four grandchil-
dren.

“They’re all living on the
West Coast,” Manley said.
“We have big phone bills.”

Constructed during the Great
Depression, the outer structure
was built first to ensure the
building’s completion. The con-
cept of the Nationality Rooms
was intended specifically to
fund the interior structure.

“As a Pitt ‘Pathfinder, I find
they’re wonderful in showing
families Pitt’s rich
history, strong
diversity and com-
mitment to excel-
lence,” said Todd
Neufeld.

What students
may not realize is
that the Nationality
Rooms require a
great deal of work.
Building a room
starts with the for-
mation of an open
committee. The
members are citi-
zens of their native
countries, as well
as residents of local
communities.
Fund—raising activities include
dinners, dances and lectures, as
well as festivals and the solicita-
tion of funds.

“Years ago, if we worked

professors face when up for tenure, he said.

After the department chair approves of the
nominee, the senior vice chancellor must do
likewise. Then the provost decides whether to
grant tenure. In schools other than Health
Sciences, once the candidates are approved by
the department chair, their names go directly to
the provost.

“The thing that I think is simply critical is
that the faculty in the Health Sciences does not
have to have this additional step to go
through,” Zullo said.

The faculty in the School of Dental Medicine
is particularly affected by the way tenure is
granted, he said, with only one professor from

the school being granted tenure in the past 10
years.

The structure of dental education precludes
its faculty from receiving the larger, more pres-
tigious grants, Zullo said, because its emphasis
is on clinical treatment rather than research.

Grants given to professors are often taken
into account when the question of tenure
comes up, according to Zullo.

A fellow faculty member from the School of
Dental Science echoed Zullo’s concerns.

Organized a month ago at the request of Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor, the committee
hopes to make a selection by March and to
have the new senior vice chancellor working at
the position in the summer of 1995.

Austrian, Indian and Japanese
Rooms, which are all in plan-
ning stages. Of the three, the
Austrian Room is the furthest
along, with construction tenta-
tively scheduled to begin in
January of 1995. Depending on
material availability and other
factors, the anticipated dedica-
tion date is August 1995.

The Indian and Japanese
Rooms are both presently in
fund-raising stages. The
Japanese city of Omiya has con-
tributed $5,000 to the project,
and in addition its school district
has raised $21,000 to date. The
committee has virtually final-
ized its concept for the room,
however no construction date
has been set.

As far as Rachel Yudell is
concerned, “There is no excuse
if you haven’t seen the
Nationality Rooms and you are
beyond the freshman level.”

Many students, in addition to
Yudell, said the Nationality
Rooms are a benefit to the uni-
versity. Carolyn Gerlocka, for
example, emphasizes, “I find
that when you are studying a

Opinions

It's time for crime reform

One of the hottest issues in this year’s political campaigns
has been crime and prison reform. The Pitt News feels it
time for substantive reform of the criminal justice system.
Therefore, we recommend the following.

The first issue of concern is the death penalty. As it is cur-
rently instituted, few people are put to death and the costs of
endless appeals are enormous.

One of two things should be done: either we should
streamline the appeals process, such as by limiting criminals
to one appeal, or the death penalty should be elimin-
ated. Without streamlining the appeals process, the death
penalty is an inefficient program which fails to deter crim-
inals.

Prison reform is also direly needed. Prisons are currently
overstocked and are forced to release hardened criminals
into society long before their prison terms are served.

It is easy to say we should build more prisons, but that
alone is certainly not the answer. Additional prisons would
merely increase the already enormous price tag for keeping
prisoners in jail. There are a number of ways, however, to
improve this system.

In effect, prisons should be made to pay for

‘ themselves. We need to reinstitute the idea of hard labor.

There are plenty of projects on which prisoners could
be placed, like road improvement, which would
give something back to society. Having a poten-
tial labor force of that size merely sitting in prison is
ridiculous.

Also, there havebeen proposals of charging prisoners
for their “rooms.” Bedford County is planning to charge
prisoners $10 a night during their stay and extra fees
for things like non-emergency medical treatment.
The nightly fee idea is a questionable policy, because the
reason many prisoners are in prison is because they lack
funds.

However, it could be instituted if it were done on an
ability-to—pay basis. On the other hand, charging for other
services is an excellent idea. A large portion of the rampant
costs involved in prison maintenance comes from such
things as unnecessary medical treatment. Such a policy
wouldgmake prisoners think before trying to abuse the sys-
tem.

Another way to take the pressure off the prisons is for the
police to place less emphasis on victimless crime. Prisons
are being flooded with inmates with charges that are not
very dangerous to society.

Rather than arrest individual drug users, police should
go to the heart of the problem and also transfer more
resources to street patrol in an attempt to cut down on vio-
lent crime.

By combining all of these reforms, the cost of crime
punishment to society could be dramatically reduced.
This would allow longer prison terms, as additional prisons
could be built with the saved funds.

It would also free up the prison space used by victimless
criminals. If we can accomplish this, then this would be the
first step toward truly making this a safer society.

Instigator

In the three'years that I have
been a student here at Pitt,
I have read The Pitt News
and found it informative
and ‘neutral in its repor-

‘ ting until now. It seems to

me that there has been a lot
of “Greek bashing” going
on this semester, and I do
believe that The Pitt News has
been instigator in this recent
event

I am a member of a fratemi—
ty here at Pitt, and in the three
years I’ve been here I’ve
found my fraternity experience
fun. It’s allowed me to meet a
lot of people and make friend-
ships campuswide, as well as
other campuses.

I’ve found fraternity parties
fun, but not “social clubs that
cater to underage students.” I
can honestly say that every
fraternity party I have been to,
including my own, the broth-
ers have been responsible in
handling crisis situations had
they arisen and, in general,
look out for the welfare of
their guests.

I am not denying that the
sexual assault occurred at that
fraternity party in September,
but every fraternity party I
have been to, I have never
seen, nor heard of, any sexual
assaults.

Yet when I lived in Tower C,
I witnessed drunk girls signing
in guys and the next day cry-
ing to a campus police in the
lobby because she was raped.

If the sexual assault
occurred at the party in
September, I believe that those
individuals involved should be
punished, but not the entire
fraternity. It is not the other
members’ fault, so why should
they be punished?

Yet they stand accused
because The Pitt News printed
the fraternities’ names. I
believe this was poor judge-
ment by The Pitt News.

By naming these fraternities,

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

The Pitt News made three
houses out to be rapists. Is this
right? Thanks to The Pitt
News, brothers at these frater-
nities who were not even
involved in the assault now
stand accused not by a court,
but by the student body! I feel
that this is doing these frater-
nity members injustice.

In response to the coming
out article, I found that this
also was in poor taste for the
same reason — naming the
fraternities involved. I feel that
The Pitt News should have
refrained from printing the
names of the fraternities that

Mr. Gray had boyfriends
in. Don’t get me wrong, if Mr.
Gray wanted to come out
of the closet that is fine, he has
every right to do so. But
I don’t believe The Pitt News
realized what it did when
it printed the names of those
fraternities named in the arti-
cle.

By having these fraternities
named,'it labeled the entire
organization as “gay.” Is
this correct? Yes, the organiza-
tion may have had a homosex-
ual member, but is the entire
fraternity “gay?” Well, that's
the message I believe The Pitt
News sent out to the student
body. Secondly, by naming
these fraternities, it created
a “witch hunt” among those
fraternities to find out
who makes up the “two mem-

bers” in the fraternity who are .

gay-

These gay members, or
pledges, may not have wanted
to come out about their sexual
identity. Thanks to The Pitt
News, these people have all
the more reason to “fear”
being found out. Is" this a good
consequence?

In conclusion, I suggest The
Pitt News not print the names
of the fraternities unless writ-
ten consent is given. They
should be treated as an indi-
vidual and their identity pro-
tected by the press.

As a result of the "recent fra-
ternity bashing in The Pitt
News, all fraternities are now
suffering.

All members are now
labeled as “rapists” or “homo-
sexuals.” I am. not a “rapist,”
nor a “homosexual,” but I am
a fraternity brother and proud
of it!

Brett C. Beauregar

Brotherhood

I am responding to the col-
umn “Personal Look at Gay
Members,” with some of my
own experiences as a bisexual
and alumnus at CMU.

Being in my situation taught
me that intolerance doesn’t
come from just one direction.
Just as fraternity members
can be intolerant of queers,
queers and queer—positives
can be intolerant of Greeks.

A disturbingly small num-
ber of people that I’ve talked
with have had no problem
with me being a part of both
groups.

But defending my Greek
membership made me realize
why it was important
to me. Talking to others about
my house, I would tell them
that what we had was a group
that would come together
under the common bond
of brotherhood regardless
of differences. Our house
would have disagreements,
sometimes serious, some-
times strong enough to shat-
ter.

But it never did. And when
the most bitter disagreements
were crushed by the most
diehard respect and honor was
when I was proudest to be a
Sig Tau.

That is what brotherhood
is. So if you’re a fraternity
member who would disown
a gay brother, then quite hon-
estly, you don’t have the first
clue what being a brother is
about

“It’s

good, and it feels great. I just
wish it could have happened
earlier,” Pitt wide receiver
Billy Davis said of the win.

“It was long overdue,” cen-
ter Lawson Mollica said.

The victim — the Temple
Owls. The outcome ——-— an
assaulting 45-19 win.

After being deprived
for six straight weeks, includ-
ing four conference games,
Pitt finally cracked the win
column in a triumphant fash-
ion. ‘

This is opposed to the fash-
ion in which Pitt has become
accustomed to losing — in a
wild, degrading manner.

Despite all the bad
bounces, all the zany plays
and all the interceptions that
were run back for touch-
downs that the Panthers have
been victims of all season,
things at last went Pitt’s way.

For example, in a frantic
five—possession series in the
second quarter, Pitt and
Temple combined for five
consecutive turnovers. But
the Panthers, who usually
flirt with doom when they
turn the ball over, were the
ones taking advantage of
their meek prey.

Pitt cashed in twice on
Temple turnovers, whereas
the Owls scraped nothing but
more turnovers in their
efforts.

After John Ryan threw his
only interception of the game,
Pitt took the ball right back
when safety David Sumner
picked off Henry Burris’ pass
and ran down the sideline for
a 20-yard touchdown.

Two turnovers later the
Panthers capitalized again on
Tom Bamt’s fumble-causing
sack. Wasting little time,
Ryan hit Chad Askew for a
four-yard touchdown pass to
up the score 28-7.

It was a game of role rever-
sals in a sense, except the
Owls played their usual feet-
wiping selves.

“It feels good to have some
luck go our way, because
we’ve had a lot of bad breaks
all season,” Askew said.

den, off their backs and a
cleansed soul, the Panthers

Panthers slaughter Temple, 45-I9

By Brady Slater
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt football team got
caught up in the Halloween
spirit on Saturday. Donning the
cape of a dominant football
team, the Panthers finally
ended up in the winning lane of
a’ route, beating the Temple
Owls 45-19 at Pitt Stadium.

Pitt’s 45 points is its highest
total since the team scored 52
points against Kent State three
years ago.

“We came in, we knew what
we had to do and everybody
was comfortable with the game
plan,” quarterback John Ryan
said.

Pitt’s offense looked particu-
larly at case on its way to
amassing 547 yards. Ryan
passed for 330 of those yards
and four touchdowns.

“He did an excellent job,”
head coach Johnny Majors
said. “When he has some time
he’s quite effective  our pass
protection held up better than it
has all year.”

Two of Ryan’s TD tosses
went to wideout Billy Davis,

who finished with seven catch- A

es for 116 yards. Receiver
Chad Askew also topped the
100 mark with eight catches for
138 yards and one TD.

Running back Billy West car-
ried 28 times for 149 yards,
giving him 1,010 yards in just
eight starts this season.

Volleybol clrps to Husies

By Adam Pincus

Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team
has only itself to blame, as it
was not able to maintain sole
possession of first place in
the Big East.

Prior to Wednesday, the
Lady Panthers (l5—8 overall)
shared the top spot in the
conference with the UConn
Huskies. However, after
Seton Hall was able to knock
off the Huskies on
Wednesday night, Pitt
assumed first place all by

’ itself.

Unfortunately, the team’s
reign only lasted for three
days. On Saturday afternoon,
Pitt faced a very determined
UConn squad, which was
able to defeat Pitt and cam its
share of the top seed.

“We played very poorly,
and we deserved to lose the
game,” sophomore middle
hitter Jennie Driscoll said.
“We were not making the
right adjustments that we
needed to make, and we
didn’t play with any emotion,
so we lost.”

UConn did its damage in
four games. The scores were
15-11, 16-14, 7-15 and 15-9.

Billy Davis caught seven passes for 116 yards and two TDs.

ball player,” Majors said. “He’s
tough, intelligent. He runs hard,
and he sees daylight well.”

The Panthers basked in end-
zone illumination on the first
drive of the game, even after it

looked like their season-long_

penalty plague‘wou1d stall yet
another drive.

A 15-yard clipping penalty
on a West Virginia 7-yard gain
took Pitt from a second-and-

goal to a second—and-18 from
the Temple 20. But on the next
play, Ryan hit Davis crossing in
the front of the endzone for the
score.

“Usually when something
goes wrong like that, the
coaches really don’t have that
much confidence to call a play
like that,” Ryan said. “They
usually call a run or some-
thing.”

Pitt News File Photo

Jennie Driscoll and the Lady Panthers‘ loss puts them in a

three-way tie for first place.
“It was a very mental loss,”
Driscoll said. “There was no
way that team should have
even taken a game against us,
let alone three. We just
assumed that we were going
to just stroll right through
UConn and win the Big East
because we are Pittsburgh,
and that obviously didn’t

happen.”

There is now a three-way
tie for first place between
Pitt, UConn and Seton Hall.
Match scores are the criteria
that the Big East uses to
determine the conference
champion and seedings.

Since these three teams

Down 7-0, Temp1e’s first
series conjured up shades of the
big-play, see-saw second half
of the West Virginia game.

On third-and—long from their
own 35, Owl quarterback
Henry Burris threw a middle
screen to split end Marc Baxter,
who broke to the outside for 61
yards before Pitt corner
Anthony Dorsett hauled him
down at the Pitt 4».

The Owls scored on fourth-
and-goal from the one on a
Burris sneak.

A minute into the second
quarter, Ryan threw complete
to a wide-open Dietrich Jells.
Jells proceeded to side-step a
diving cornerback Lamart
Watts on his way to a 61-yard
touchdown.

But Temple had no answer
for that score. -

Midway through the second
quarter, following Ryan’s only
interception, safety David
Sumner read a Burris’ sideline
pass perfectly, picked it off and
raced 20 yards untouched for a
Pitt score. 1

And with under four minutes
left in the first half, defensive
end Tom Barndt hit Burris,
forcing a fumble recovered by
defensive lineman Mike
Mohring. It was the third
turnover on as many posses-
sions for the grounded Owls.

and-goal from the 4, Ryan hit

scoreless
tie on

senior day

By Ed Ziegenfuss
staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team took a
crash course in missed opportu-
nities yesterday as the Panthers
ended in a scoreless tie against
Syracuse.

It was senior appreciation day
at Pitt Stadium, but the five
Panther seniors playing in their
last home game could not create
any magic and pull out a victory
in the 120 minutes played. Pitt’s
record now stands at 8-7-1 over-
all, 1-6-1 in the Big East
Conference.

The game started 30 minutes
late because the officials did not
show up at the scheduled 1:00
starting time.

“There was a mix-up with the
ofﬁcials, but it was not a factor
to either team,” Pitt head coach
Joe Luxbacher said.

Panther receiving trio too much for Temple

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor

John Ryan completed 18 of 29
passes for 330 yards and 4
touchdowns. After the game,
Ryan was overloaded with ques-
tions about his stellar perfor-
mance.

While Ryan was praised, how-
ever, three young men were
overlooked.

If it weren’t for their hustle
and determination throughout
the game, reporters probably
wouldn’t know Ryan’s name.

Pitt receivers Chad Askew,
Dietrich Jells and Billy Davis
proved to be the difference in
Saturday’s contest against
Temple.

“I think with Billy, Dietrich
and Chad all in the game at the
same time, [Temple] couldn’t
key on one guy or two guys with
three great receivers out there,”
Ryan said. “They were special.”

They did everything from
making diving catches to mak-
ing key down-ﬁeld blocks.

Askew, who has been coming
on in recent weeks, had the most
productive day of his career. The
6—foot—4—inch senior caught eight
passes for 138 yards and one
touchdown.

,“They are starting to throw the
ball to me a lot more to get my
confidence right,” Askew said.
“Coach [Bird] is always realiz-
ing what I can do, since I’m
going out every week and trying

B l’ S (I H G A

to do the best I can do.”

While Askew led in recep-
tions and yards, Davis’ two
touchdowns stood out, as he
caught seven receptions for 116
ymds

In the fourth quarter, Davis
caught an 11-yard pass, froze the
defenders and cut back for his
second score.

“I was beating that guy on that
route all day,” said Davis, com-
menting on his touchdown.

Jells, who ‘s the Big East track
champion in the 100 meters, was
also on the receiving end of a
Ryan touchdown pass.

Using his speed, Jells beat his
defender and galloped 61 yards
for the score. For the day, he
caught two passes for 67 yards
for an average of 33.5 yards per
reception.

“The big difference in this
game was that everybody was
real confident in the game plan,”
said Davis. “We had very basic
schemes we knew what we
wanted to do. And we knew
how we wanted to attack the
defenses that they were giving
us.

“It wasn’t a matter of adjust-
ing to them, but for them to
adjust to us with the scheme that
we designed.”

After this weekend’s perfor-
mance the Panthers feel that
their receiving core is one of the
best.

“I know people around the
Big East conference, and they

RDENS/\VlI.l.l

view us as being one of the best
receiving cores in the confer-
ence,” Davis said. “I think we
are. I looked at film of other
receivers and I don’t think there
are many other teams with
receivers that are comparable to
us.”

One person who helped to
open up the passing lanes was
Billy West. Due to his ﬁne rush-
ing performance, Temple
neglected the pass in some
instances. ,

At game’s end, West had
rushed for 149 yards and one
touchdown on 28 attempts.

For his efforts, the sophomore
currently has 1,010 yards rush-
ing with two games left in the
season.

“We ran it between the tackles
with our 1,000-yard back, using
our play action scheme to get the
ball down field to Chad, myself
and Dietrich,” Davis said.

The win salvaged the
Panthers’ egos. '

“Our coaches kept reminding
us every day that we couldn’t
lose to Temple,” Askew said.
“Our whole season was pretty
much riding on this game. A lost
to Temple would have made the
program go down a little bit. We
knew as a team we had to come
out and get a victory so we can
start building back up the Pitt
tradition.

“It feels good to come in and
get a victory. We usually come
in, and the coaches are mad. The

each have 1-1 records against
each other, the number of
games won head—to-head dur-
ing each match will be the
tiebreaker.

For example, if the season
ended today, Seton Hall
would have the top seed in
the conference champi-
onships because their game
record against Pitt and
UConn is 4-3. Pitt would get
the second seed with a record
of 4-4, and UConn would get
the third seed with a 3-4
record.

“If the team comes to play,
we will win the Big
East. And if we don’t,
we won’t,” head coach
Cindy Alvear said. “If we
have another showing like
we did against UConn, we
won’t, but if we play like we
did against Seton Hall, we
will. And that is the big ques-
tion.”

Despite the frustrating
loss to UConn, as long as
the team finishes strongly

this weekend against
Georgetown and Villanova
it will end the Big East with
a 7-1 record, and that may
be good enough to
earn the number one seed.

“We knew that UConn was
going to be a very emotional
team, and I guess we were
not mentally prepared. I don’t
think anyone has any answers
as to what happened this
weekend,” senior Annemarie
Mernagh said.

The fact that the Lady
Panthers have been so
successful lately, winning
7 out of their last 8 games
prior to UConn, may have
made them a slight bit com-
placent as they allowed them-
selves to relinquish first
place.

If Pitt is able to use this
game as a motivator, like it
did with the loss to Akron on
October 4, then the Lady
Panthers may be able to start
a new winning streak that
will carry into the Big East
tournament.

net of the endzone for a '

Panther’s touchdown.

The half ended with the
Panthers up 28-7.

A David Merrick field goal
on the Panther’s first posses-
sion of the second half made it
31-7. Following this, Temple
put together a 9-play, 80-yard
drive that was capped by a pass
from Burris to fullback Juan
Gaddy, who caught the ball in
the flat and scored from 11
yards out. The point-after try
failed, making it 31-13.

Temple threatened to make a
game of it later in the third
quarter with a 10-play, 51-yard
scoring drive. Burris hit tight
end P.J. Cook for a 7-yard
touchdown pass that made it
31-19. Burris’ two—point con-
version attempt was incom-
plete.

But the Panthers made game
out of the Owls on following
the kick.

A 23-yard Ryan-to-Davis
completion ended the third
quarter, and Ryan opened the
fourth with a 43-yard comple-
tion to Askew. And following a
3-yard West run, Ryan and
Davis connected for an 11-yard
touchdown.

Following a Temple punt,
West Virginia capped Pitt’s last
scoring drive with a 1-yard bull
through the line for the score
that made it 45-19.

“A lot of things came,togeth-
er today,” West said. “It’s not
that it was magic. It was that
everybody was playing with
the confidence that we needed

“It didn’t affect anybody, I
don’t think,” senior Bobby Dyer
said. “If anyone says it did, they
are just looking for an excuse.”

Once under way, the contest
was dominated by the defenses.

“Both teams played very
hard,” Luxbacher said. “It was a
tight defensive game.”

During the 60 minutes of reg-
ulation time, both -teams missed
chances at scoring. The best
chance for Pitt was a penalty
kick called on a Syracuse foul
as Mike Dyer attempted to
make his way to the net with 23
minutes and 37 seconds left in
the second half.

Eric Prex took the shot from
12 yards out. The ball arched
toward the net and over
Orangemen goalkeeper Josh
McGibbon. Fitting to the game,
though, the shot careened off

the right post and bounced back
into play. Regulation time ended
with neither team getting a
chance to break into the scoring
column.

“I don’t think this game fits
my career, but it fits this sea-
son,” Bobby Dyer said. “We
just didn’t get lucky, and it takes
luck to win.”

The first overtime period was
highlighted by a Dean Astorino
shot with 10:25 left, but
McGibbon was up to the task
and stopped the shot.

After 118 minutes had been
played, senior mid—fielder
Charlie Wasson took a pass and
dribbled down the middle of the
field. Cutting left and right,
Wasson evaded nearly all of the
Syracuse defensemen and had
one man to beat when that last
defender tripped him. The refer-
ee whistled another penalty kick

for Pitt.

Once again, Eric Prex was
called on to shoot the penalty
shot for the Panthers. With less
than two minutes left in the
game, it was a perfect opportu-
nity for Prex to be a hero in his
last home game. ' Prex
approached the ball and let it

‘ rip, but McGibbon was easily

able to save the shot and kept
the game scoreless.

“We had two penalty shots,
which usually we convert,”
Luxbacher said. .“It was a long
afternoon, a long hard game,
and we ended up with a tie. You
have to question whether it was
worth it.”

With not much time left on
the clock, neither team had any
more opportunities to score.

“It was disappointing that we
couldn’t come up with a win
today,” Luxbacher said.

Pitt managed only eight shots
on goal while Syracuse
unloaded 12 at the Panthers. Pitt
goalie Kirk Brodows had five
saves, with McGibbon of
Syracuse saving seven. Dean
Astorino led the way for Pitt
with seven shots on goal. Prex,
Brett Stezoski and Jeff Porter
had three shots each for Pitt.

Pitt has now completed its
home and conference schedule.
The Panthers travel to Slippery
Rock on Tuesday and to Penn
State on Saturday to wrap up
the season.

“Slippery Rock will be tough,
because we only get one day of
rest,” Bobby Dyer said. “Penn
State will be a war.”

“Penn State is number one in
the region and fifth in the
nation, so we still have a lot to
shoot for this year,” Luxbacher
said.

Column

°From page 6

conference frustrations are
finally relieved.

They have been relieved
in a way that would
make Miss Dominatrix
shake in her knee-high, black
leather boots — a 26-point
spanking with a total of 45
points, the highest since
Pitt’s 52 points whipped
on Kent State three years
ago. _

With no game next
weekend, the Panthers can
kick back and have a
smoke before they play
Miami Nov. 12.

“Nobody would be
offended if I smile,”
Pitt coach Johnny Majors
said.
