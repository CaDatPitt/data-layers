"Beat. the Syracuse Freshmen” or
report. to the next meeting of- -the
tribunal,” was the verdict "of the
Sophomore Tribunal jury ‘in the case
of the «Sophomore Class. vs. Uhlard
Hangartner, captain of the Fresh-
man football team at the first'meet-
ing of the Tribunal. The meeting was
held in 201 State Hall last Thursday
during the lunch period. Other ver-
dicts were: Wear a. white sock and a
greenjock with trousers turned up
half-way to the knee, wear white
socks over trouser legs and held up
by garters visible to all eyes, replace
all washed out signs on the campus
concerning the Syracuse game, lead
a. goat around the field d-uring the
Syracuse game, and wear coats in-
side out with placards attached ex-
plaining the reason. .

President Lewis Abeles of the
Sophomore Class, presided, and the
Jury consisted of members of the Stu-
dent Senate, a few upperclassmen
and Bert McNeil, of the Freshman
Class. WThe Freshmen were prose-
cuted bqyl Cliﬁord Bryce repre-
senting the Sophomore "Class.
’The, ‘ Freshmen were allowed
to speak in their own defense and
then the jury made its decision. Two
Freshmen were declared not guilty
and excused. All the Freshmen found
guilty were sentenced to wear a.'serv-
ice stripe of charcoal or any other
black substance on their faces. They
are to report to a sophomore while
serving out their punishment. All the
Fresh-men who were called’ and did
not report will get a. haircut on sight.

_ Nation-‘wide movements have been
started by the Student Friendship
Fund, administered through the
World’s Student Christian , Federa-
tion, for -the two-fold purpose of of-.

fering immediate relief to the stu-

dents of Europe and to vote on the
disarmament -question.. The‘ initial
step was taken by about two hundred
students, representing all the largest
Eastern Colleges‘ and Universities, at
zi convention called in New York City
on Sunday, October 16. Pitt. was
chosen. as one of ﬁve colleges from
Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New
Jersey to be represented. Consequent-
ly, Pitt is authorized to direct all col-
leges and preparatory schools in this
district of the state in the campaign.
 Dorothy Stewart, Pitt's representa-‘
live at‘ the conference, reports "that
the convention took action favoring
limitation of armaments to the low-
‘est possible minimum to police the
world and to insure world peace. The
student body will have an opportu-
nity to vote on drisarmament before
the ‘Disarmament Conference to be
held November 11, at Washington, D.
6., where the result will be wired not
enly from the University of Pitts-
liurgh’but from all the higher, insti-
tutions of learning in the country.‘

; Our s-harein showing world broth-
erhood will take the form of a ﬁnan-
cial ~ campaign. All students will be
approached. and ‘Pitt is expected to
take a position with Harvard, Yale,
and Princeton.'.Pit.t will entertain . a

THE Pi_sTT.

 quw uni wuun  
,   YESTERDAY

The women or the University met
in the Heinz House and were given
the ﬁrst opportunity, Tuesday, to
learn of the conditions among the
students in Europe and of the move-
ment .’being launched by American
students everywhere to offer relief
for these conditions. Miss Louise
Holmquist of New York, executive
of Student Committee of Y. W. C.
A., who spoke in the interest of the,
World Student Friendship Movement,
made very clear what these condi-
tions are. The students of Europe
are torn with hatred, suspicion and
distrust. This mental condition is
augmented by the untold physical suf-
ufering which they must endure be-

 

lack of means, to ﬁnd work.

Last year the students: of the
United States contributed $580,000
through the World’s Student Chris-
tian Federation to relieve the suit-.
fering and needs of their fellow stu-
dents in Europe. This fund was ad-
ministered impartially, with regard
to race, nationality or creed or any
other criterion than proven need.
American students are again asked
to contribute a like amount this

“I have been at this ‘University
for four years, but this is the best
pep meeting I have ever seen,” de-
clare-d “T'om” Davies, speaking at
the Syracuse football mass meeting
in "Memorial H-all last Friday at
noon. On the stage were “Pop”
Warner, the entire football squad,
Abe Klinestiver, manager of the foot-
‘balll team; -Clarence Smith, head
cheerleader, and Jim Scott,’ former
cheerleader. The meeting was called
to raise enthusiasm and practice
cheers for the “biggest football game
_in the United States,” according to
“Tom” Holleran. .

Speeches were made by Dan -Kovar
who opened the meeting, Pop War-
ner, Abe Klinestiver, Davies, Holler-
an and Harvey Harman. Carl Mulert,
vice president of the Student Sen-
ate, .plresided. After the speeches,
Smith and S-cott lead a. few cheers
and gave instructions concerning
cheering at the game. The Sand in-
terposed with musical selections and
the meeting closed with the singing
of “Alma. Mater” and an “Alle-
ghenee.”

A Each speaker was greeted‘ with
large applause and -Walked to his
seat after his speech to the tune. of

students not to be -overconﬁdent, be-
cause he had seen the ‘‘Orange‘’ team

_ must have the co-operation of alumni and students i-n two respects.
First, students and alumni must patronize our advertisers. The
Weekly contains advertisements from ﬁrms whose character has been
closely scrutinized. These ﬁrms have conﬁdence that this publication

I will secure patronage from Pitt students. Accordingly, it is the duty

of the students not only to deal with these companies, but also -to let

them know that you are enrolled in this University. If you deal with

any of our advertisers, tell them that you read their advertisements
, in this paper. If you do so, The VVeekly will be greatly beneﬁted.

- Then, we must have co-operation in obtaining news. As long as
The 'Weekly' was limited to four pages, many organizations were un-
able to obtain their necessary publicity. It was no fault of the staff.
The limits of space prevented much news from being put into print.
With eight pages, the staff feels that it can cover all the news of the
campus and thatlschool activities, fraternities, clubs, athletics and
other organizations will receive their just publicity.

Ba.ckI’l.‘he Weekly in these two respects and we are sure that you

will be satisﬁed with the results.

NO 1923 OWL! Q

 

t  1923 Owl! This is the unprecedented situation which faces

' the business management of this ysar’s Junior publication.
1 -  »bers of the Advisory Board of Student Activities individually have

Mem-

taken the stand that no year book will be published unless the Junior

. class, through the Owl management, can show that an appreciable
amount of moneyhas been collected for its publication.

Owl managers have been on the campus for nearly two weeks,

seeking to obtain subscriptions. And what has been the result? At

the" time ofthis writing only one subscription had been received by

the business manager.

Such is the record of the Class of 1923 which

last year made claims to being one of the best organized groups which

. — this University had ever contained.

If one subscription in two weeks.

is the total which this class can produce, it surely can not consider
itself a “world-beater’-’ as far as classes go. . .
The Owl absolutely needs the support of all Juniors, if they wish
.’ to have-a year book. If the members of the class neglect to support
their publication, they probably will be faced with the situation of
being the ﬁrst Junior class to fail to- publish an Owl. VVhether an
Owl is published depends solely upon. the attitude of Juniorstudents.
If they are slackers, they may be without an Owl. If they are hard

workers, they will have one.
An Owl or’ no Owl. That is
selves’ must decide it-

the problem. The Juniors them-

Casts For Plays:

Will Be Picked
By Pitt Players

The plays selected ‘to be presented
by the Pitt Players during the win-
ter season are by such noted au-
thors as Shaw, Moliere and Synge.

The try-outs held last Frid‘-as’
brought to light much dramatic tal-
ent. '1‘i-yiouts will be -continued this
Friday from 3 to 5, in Room 215,
Alumni Hall. This will give an Op-
portunity to those who could not ap-
pear last week to sho-w what ability
they possess in this ﬁeld.

Passages from’ Swohnitzle-r’.s»
tol,’,’_ Shaw’s “Arms and the Man." Mo-
liere’s “Doctor in Spite of Himself”

or Syngefs “Riders to the Sea.” may

be presented by those trying out and
these may be supplemented by a per-
sonal selection.

Announcement of -casts will be
made known asdsoon as all try-outs
are completed. Vacancies in the or-
ganization make it possible for many
with histrionic ability to become af-
ﬁliated with the club.

shaping of policies, both national and
international. The representatives
of governments meeting at Wash-
ington, November 11, can be
strengthened in their resolution to
plimit armament if sufficient public
opinion can be brought to ‘bear upon
them. The opinion of American Col-
lege Students. can be the means of
making history if it is strong enough
and insistent enough to demand real
action upon the part of representa-
tives to the cconfe.renceL

The question as to how Pitt is to
take part in the national movement
presents itself. The Princeton plan
provides that a telegram be sent to
Washington, November 11, voicing
the sentiment of the entire student
for dtisarmament. The Penn State

delegates: to the conference, carry-
ing with them petitions signed by
all the students.

In order to plan some action a con-_
ference was held in Heinz House’,
yesterday morning at which Dean
Amos, M. D-. Straney, Miss‘ Ebers-
bach and student leaders represent-
ing the Senate,’ W. S. ‘G. A., Y. 
C, A. and Y. W. C. A. were present.

PENNSYLVANIA SYSTEM
Pittsburgh, Pa.,‘octobei- 19, 1921.

_l have received your favor‘ of the 14th instant, regarding move-
ment of the University of Pittsburh football team and followers from
Pittsburgh to Philadelphia account of game to be played at that point
with the University of Pennsylvania, October 29. ,

. with reference to your inquiry as to whether a reduced fare can
be named for this movement, I beg leave to advise that we are notil-in
a position to meet with your wishes in that regard. L A

While it is true the Central Passenger Association, which has ‘:
- jurisdiction over rate matters west of Pittsburgh, has permitted re-
duced fares undercertaln conditions for inter collegiate football con-
tests, nevertheless the Trunk Line Association which has jurisdiction
over the lines cast of Pittsburgh at their meeting yesterday unani-
mously voted not to accord any reduced fares for movements of this

Yours very truly,

Theformation of “a "hockey team at;
Pitt has been agitated recently from
a L number of sources.-. ._'ll'he.:cbances _ are
that there, can be no such ‘organiza-
tion this year. Nevertheless,.. it is not
beyond the realms of possibility.
‘-Thgre are a large number of A good
hockey men in school, The freshmen
class, especially, contains the pick of
the men in the City Scholgistic League
last year. With sufficientlpractice and
capable coaching there is littlerdoubt

which in a few years would reach the

Dartmouth, and other
schools. _A ~ A .
The difficulty in starting hockey
this year lies in «the fact that a co-
operative agreement pmustibe reached

big eastern

iment before a team can be put on
the . ice. Special hours for practice
would .haye to be provided, as would
some arrangement for bringing teams
here from the east. These matters

‘will have to be worked out in time,

‘but Director Miller has promised to

ment with »,the Duquesno .-Garden
management. 1 . L. .
. Students who havefplayed “hockey

A‘ should leave their names with Direc-
_tor Miller, so that if anything should "

develop, no time will be lost.

THE GREATEST

*F BilFI Hanna, dmincht New°York‘ sport writer, called the 191e_ Pitt team -
:‘th:e“greatest team that ever stepped onto a fFo’otball"ﬁeld.‘ The 1916 Pitt team
‘ :\wo‘n tliat"rc*putation largely ‘through its decisive 30-0 ~wallFo‘ping ‘ofsyracusey
Twhen Flt was supposed ‘that Syracuse was-lnvincib|e..“ -That. memorable vic-

tpry'Awas?a|lA the more surprising because the week previous Pitt had been

held Ato a 20-19 score by the Navy. -Th,erc_.ls remarkable similarity between
the season of A‘l.9.1F6 and Lthé”'pres'en.1L;“season.-
had certainly ‘been. none too impressive.

Pitt's record up to last Saturday
Syracuse Lagaln . was supposed. to
have one of the strongest teams, in" the country, yetA.the“old Panther steam-
rollergot going just right and mowed. down the Orange as though there were
no opposition FA'at1‘LLaFll‘. LA There is not the least’ doubt whatsoever in_ our mind
but that if Bill‘ Hanna could have seen last Saturday’s game he would,have
declared the Pitt team of 1921 thee ual, if not the superior of the~1916~’team.
lf a more perfect football machine han Pop Warner’: was last Saturday

.,ever was i.nventet.d».\_N.e would give our last penny to see it. . A team surely

wasL.ncv,er;.mor’e,deserving of l:he._congr.-atulations of a student body. If
there was any Pitt student after last Saturday’s game who wasn’1L: more
proud of his Alma -Mater than of anything else in the world, excepting his

Tcountryand his‘ home, he ought toltakc Chancellor Bowman's advice and get”

out right away. F ' . G .
To ‘select any few who“were responsible“ for the victory is an impossible

A'l:-ask: Every man onlthc.-Pitt team, ‘including the substitutes, played one of

t._he~Agrcate‘st, if not the greateFst;'gamc ofhlscareer. There was nothing that
lookedlike a weak. spot on the whole team... However, rwithout detracting

-in the least fromlzhe praise that is coming to the rest of the team,‘ we must,
‘in justice to the‘ three men,Ai make special mention of theA_wor_k of Stein,

o_aw¢s and "Ho|L1e,LI'_an’.L Deferisively _Herb’s playing shone as the brightest
star inthe heavens.’ He wasln ‘every play’, was responsible for number-Fess

tackles, many-ofFjthemF for big” losses, and his power to diagnose the other

side's plays was .ccrtalnly'.thc most uncanny ever seen at Forbes Field. If
there was a doubt -in anyone’s mind of Herby’s deserving All-American last
year thqreshould be none whatsoever now. Tommy Davies’, playing gave
him a substantial boostlfor an All-American position. -His carrying of the
bal_l was none less ﬂgreat .than_that which l1asF won him fame the past few
years. While he, dld_not get"away_ for any of the long‘:-uns we have come
to expect too ’o_fteLn, all offhis gains were of. the most consistent order and
more than did .juFstlicc to the Davles of old- Tom Holleran‘ more than made
good. his promise to -do*two men's workand was about “the wildest ‘Irish-A

:man”- we ever seiw—,-so wild, in fact, that poor little Benny Moses was scared
to death. Holler-an played, we frankly believe, the best game of hi‘s.;caree_I*.ﬁ

In addition to his splendid work on offense and defense his judgment in se-
lecting Iplaysi was’ absolutely unlmpefachable.
Tommy that there are, no better quarterbacksln thcland. _

PROSPECTS FOR A‘ HOCKEY TEAM   ‘~* A F 

._Every year. there. is a demand foria hockey team. This year‘ ‘the’ cry
comes \louder;th,an~F ever before. A number of men have already" handed their
names to Dircctjof?.Miller,‘ signifying that they would report for hockey, were

, ajn’ice team organized. AmFForlg‘tl1e*m were practically all of. the,bes,t',i'n’er:’F in

the.clty high school leaguef-the“ past-'AtwoLyears. There is"no cloub’t "but: what
there is material which: would soon~.d.evelop hockey at Pitt to ‘the’ plane on
which ltexists. at Dartmouth, Yale and same other of the big, cas‘tc“i'nFfFsF',(:li*ooljs.
Howe.vc"r there are many problems yet to be solved before Pitt can p’u’t"a”teTat-‘rn
on the ice. The most important of‘Atbes_c has to do with the nccessar co-
operation ‘between the Duquesnc Garden management and the Pitt F'aLuf_‘ho'rl-
ties In regard to practice hours and the scheduling» of \games,F’TljLe;§e’: 1'9“ no

matter of proﬁt to the Duquesnc Garden‘ people, if the thingwere go‘n’eF’into

will not be too far in the future. Any students who have had hockey.expeF-
