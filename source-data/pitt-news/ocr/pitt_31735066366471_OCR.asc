The YM-YWCA-sponsored Proj-
ect Teach is seeking the support
Jot students and faculty who de-
‘:I_ sire a re-evaluation of the under-

‘(student-faculty group will hold

interested in the project. Time and
place ‘will be announced later.
A The project's steering commit-
tee organized three committees
at a recent meeting. The ﬁrst
committ'ee will re-evaluate the
distribution of studies courses.
The second will re-evaluate the
entire curriculum, include ma-
jor and minor requirements and
honors courses.

The development of a merit
system for professors is the goal
of the third committee. It will in-

‘-.§‘,vestigate the manner in which

 felt that the students as a whole,

:¥‘

   

other colleges recognize good
teachers and try to ﬁnd the best
way to reward professors for out-
standing classroom teaching on
this campus. The committee will
also write a course guide.
Faculty members at the meet-
‘ ing felt that the project's recom-
mendations submitted before Jan.
1 to the Libenal Arts (LA) "Exe-
cutive Council, a faculty commit-
tee working under LA Dean
James A. Kehl
The faculty members present

' should have a voice in the mat-
ter. “Just how much is accom-
plished is directly dependent up-
on just how serious student in-
‘terest is,” said Dr. James Merritt,
assistant professor of English.

According to Frank Watanabe,
YMCA staff adviser to the proj-
ect, faculty members felt that
students have the obligation to
“shape up- to meet the kind of
quality education they want.”

Watanabe explained that proj-
ect Teach is “open to co-opera-

the value in the project is “the
process of interaction between
faculty and students as well as
the end goal.” »

The project is composed of
nine faculty and 22 students, and
membership on all the commit-
‘tees is open to other interested
faculty and students. They may in-
quire at the “Y” Office, 210 SU.

Bill Murphy is the overall chair-
man. Joel,Rosenberg heads the

ley HalL

Dr. Thomas Donahue, professor of
physics; and Allen Kent, profes-
sor in the Graduate School of Li-
brary and Information Sciences.

According to Dr. Cohen, the
geochemistry research is center-
ed on a study of the effects of
collisions of meteorites with the
earth and moon. Some of the
studies include those on: hyper-
velocity shock effects in meteor-
ites which have collided with
each other in space; the proper-
ties of rocks found near meteor-
ite-like craters; and the quantita-
tive examination of lunar craters
using Ranger VII, VIII, and IX
photographs.

Dr. A Donahue explained four
phases of work-in the areas of
atomic physics and aeronomy.
“In our theoretical studies, we
are trying to determine and un-
derstand the distribution of hy-
drogen and helium around the
earth from 60 ’miles to" 40,000
miles above the surface; the re-
-actions involving atomic sodium
in the upper atmosphere; ionos-
pheric reaction rates; - radioactive
transfer of resonance radiation
\ and excitation by electrons in
the day-glow and Aurorae,” he
said. ,

The three remaining phases of

this research are: A ground‘ based
explorations of air-glow,’ rocket
experiments ﬂown from U.S. and
French launch sites; and labora-
tory studies of atomic collision
‘processes.
“ Prof. Kent, director of the
Knowledge Availability Systems

building, explained the purpose
of- the Center. “The Center has
undertaken a program with the
National Aeronautics and Space

‘Playboy’ Bares Facts
In Vietnam Survey .

A majority of U. S. college students believe’ that if
there is no negotiated settlement in Vietnam before the end
of this year, the United States should push the war into
North Vietnam. This is one of several ﬁndings of the ﬁrst
Playboy College Opinion Survey, conducted by Playboy Mag-
azine. The survey polled 200 college campuses.

An even larger percentage of
. students believe the United States
should extend bombing raids to

other North Vietnamese cities.
The survey, which measured
opinions of both students and
faculty members, found that the

not take the above attitude and
feel instead that the military ac-
tions should be conﬁned to South
Vietnam only.

The students and faculty, how-
ever, make it clear that they
overwhelmingly believe that

The survey also reflects opinions
from campuses on a regional
basis — in the East, Midwest,
South, Southwest, and West.

A noticeable exception to the
uniformity of opinion occured on
the question of..ifShouId we avoid
bombing military installations in
populous areas of North Vietnam,
such as Hanoi? While 67 per cent
of all student respondents favor
bombing these areas, 82 per cent
of all student respondents favor
puses advocate bombing but only

Public ire has been aroused recently by
, a group of young men, mostly students, who
 protest United States involvement in Viet-
 nam by setting ﬁre to their draft cards in
violation of federal law.

.- This mall and often bearded minority
represents a segment of the population
whose political opinions should be fairly re-
ported. With this in mind, I set out last
night with notebook in hand to interview
University student Dell Krip who several
weeks "ago attempted to break into radio
station WAMO so that he could burn his
draft card on the Porky Chedwick show.

: I I HAD expected that locating Krip would
be difficult since he has been sought by‘
the FBI and HUAC ever since his abortive
‘protest. But Mr. Krip proved ridiculously
easy to ﬁnd because the draft card burners
are not only a small but also an extremely
noisy minority.

 It was the clatter of spoons hitting a
wash-pan which ﬁrst attracted my atten-
;_tion to the tiny knot of people seated on
the ﬂoor of the Tower C lounge on the Gus-
tine‘ side. A long blast on a steam whistle
held by one of their number deepened my
-interest as well as hurt my eardrums. But
when a lanky boy with a ﬂowing beard
‘emerged from the group and set off a stick
of dynamite under a nearby chair, I knew
I had found my man.

L “Mr. Dell Krip, I presume,” I said, ex-
tending my hand.

>. He looked at me blankly, then held out
«both of his arms,. palms down, ﬁsts closedr’
.  Ild. wrists together.

acaught up with me. But lemme get a tooth-
brush, “Okay.”

“No, no,” I replied, smiling broadly. “I

of cotton from each of his ears, then shook
my outstretched hand.

‘-‘So you’re not the FBI,” he said.
“No. I represent . . .” ’
“The thinking public?” he interrupted. ,
We both laughed. _
“We’re interested in knowing more
about the motives underlying your unusual
method of political protest,” I continued.

“Actually, you know, our protests cover
a great deal more area than politics,” he
replied. “The draft card burning isonly our
most recent and most widely publicized pro-
test by ﬁre, as you might call it. You may
have read about Harry Snig up at Illinois
who burned his social security card as a
protest against having to work for a liv-

Such duplication of effort is unnecessary. Of the three groups, the
Y Project structure is the most efficient. Instead of having any student,

    

student-faculty, or other liberal arts evaluations being conducted separ-

ately, there should be a group similar to the Y’s structure with the power
of the LA Executive Council.

Such a group would provide the opportunity for interaction between

students and faculty which the Y Project emphasizes. Such a group would

evaluate the liberal arts realm as all three groups currently do. Such a
group would have authority, something possessed by the LA Executive

This committee would allow for student initiative and professional
consultation on devising a program. Their effort would probably take less
time and produce a higher quality product than any of the efforts of the
three separate groups. i

If the University continues the structure as it currently stands,

I changes in the liberal arts system may never occur.”

Thanksgiving, which used
to be such a nice non—parti-
san holiday has this year
been turned into an occasion
in which Americans should
thank Lyndon Johnson, not
necessarily God for the bless-
ings we en-
J°Y- . .

Beginning
w i t h t h e
Pres i d e nt ’ s
traditional
Thanksgiving
Proclamation
by thanking
the Lord “for

  

D’Il’P0L1'l0 all the bless-
ings that have been bestow- .
ed upon our nation during
the past 12 months,” the,
President of all the people
set the tone of his message

I...

“Was he a member of your group?” I
asked, incredulous.

“O yes. Illinois branch of course. And
Bill _Trumming from Iowa who burned his
driver's license to protest parking meters,
that was one of our boys.”

“Amazing!” I exclaimed.

“But that's not all,” he went on. “We’ve
burned money to protest credit buying, and
credit cards to protest money, and diplomas
to protest academic hyprocrisy, and, oh, all
sorts of things. Tomorrow we're going to
burn our birth certiﬁcates as a protest
against life.”

“You may have something" there,” I
admitted.

“Well you'll have- to excuse me now, I’m
afraid,” he said, ﬁshing a cigarette from a
crumbled pack in his pocket. “I’ve got plen-
ty to do to getthe boys ready for tomor-
row’s demonstration. They’re a few decibels
too soft today. Out of practice I guess.”

I thanked him and had turned to leave

of self-congratulation for an
LBJ job well done.

_ “WHEN THE Pilgrims
ﬁrst observed Thanksgiving
nearly 350 years ago, life
was harsh and unrelenting.”
(In other w 0 r ds Lyndon
Johnson wasn’t President).
But wait, “Today we have
much ‘more than an abun-
dant harvest.” How did 'it

' all come about? The Presi-

dent will ‘tell us.

“In the past year, we have
added greatly to that nation-
al legacy. We have guaran-
teed the right to vote to all
our citizens. We have pledged
dignity to our elder1y——even
in sickness. We have added
new dimensions’ to the edu-

‘cation of our youth. We have
broadened the horizons .. of
opportunity for our poor.
And all the while, we have
enjoyed the greatest pros-
perity in history.” (Please
excuse the President’s mod-
esty for using -“we” instead
of “I.”)

‘ AND LET us not forget
“those steadfast principles
that the Pilgrims forged for
all generations: the belief
in the essential dignity of
man, the restless search for
a better world for all, and

« courage—as shown by our

sons in Vietnam today—to
defend the cause of freedom

“. . . For these blessings
we thank God 'most__..of all
(and LBJ second of all?).”

But how about those Who
_don’t buy all of the blessings
that the cornucopia from
Texas has seen ﬁt, in all his
inﬁnite wisdom, to bestow-
upon the , nation? Is there
anything for them to be
thankful for at grandma’s
farm Thursday?

THANKS,“ MR. President,
for “guaranteeing the right
to vote to all our citizens”

but doesn't “all” mean those '

who can't vote in Texas too,
but are not protected by this
bill? Thanks for giving “dig-
nity to our elderly” but what
about those who feel the eld-
erly can have more dignity,
more health care and for less
money under some other
plan? Do they get “the dig-
nity” .-without even being
thankful for it? How big of
you. ‘

- Thanks, but no thanks for
the efforts to beneﬁt educa-
tion and to help the poor.
And what about those who,
with nothing against the
soldiers in Vietnam, honestly

are not thankful for current’?

American policies there? Al-
though I do not happen to

be one of them I still want,

these people to have a happy,

IT’S A new political low A

Senator Engels Explains
Role of Student Government

By. MARK RAVENSCRAFT
Student Government Senator
Martin Engels spoke to Men’s
Freshmen Council on the Able

Party and Student Government,

(SG) elections at Tuesday’s meet-
ing.

Engels said he viewed SG as
a means of “creating an identity
for ourselves” and providing ex-
perience in«1:‘he ﬁeld of “learning
how to deal with people.” Ex-
plaining how the Able Party
works during an election, Engels
said everyone who runs for po-
litical office at the University
should be prepared to work hard
and spend a lot of time on the

campaign. Speaking on campus
parties, he said that he was in
favor of them because of the

‘ advantage of working as a group

in the SG on legislative programs.

Wayne Masterman and Frank
Slovich were selected to help Roy
Meckler and Basil Zitelli draft a
resolution urging freshman rep-
resentation on the Orientation
Committee. A commuter mailout
was approved by the Council.
Each freshman commuter will be
mailed a questionnaire for com-
ments on problems facing com-

tivities. Tom Bryan, chairman of
the Council’s Commuter Commit-
tee is in charge of this pilot

Lucas to Longo Passes Set Up
Last Second Score in 30 - 27 Win

By TOM SACHS

The old-timers say that anything can happen in a Pitt-Penn State game, but they’re
zvrong. Saturday’s 30-27 upset showed that everything, including the impossible, could
happen in the interstate rivalry.

The impossible must be looked at from the side of the Nittany Lions. At the end of
the ﬁrst half, they found themselves behind 20-0 to a team that hadn’t been noted for

much of anything except for being a so-so scrimmage opponent for some of the nation’s ’

top offenses.

. Sensing that their 27th conse-
cutive winning season was in
jeopardy, the Lions rallied to tie
the score at 27-27 with only 55
seconds remaining in the game.
It was at this point that the Pan-
thers made believers out of those

who had never before believed.‘

there was such a thing as a mir-
acle.

They marked 59 yards to the-

State one yard line and then
called in somebody named Frank
Clark to try an 18-yard ﬁeld goal.
Clark, who is so short he has

trouble seeing the goal posts with

all those people in front of him,

‘ . bloomed the ball between the up-.-‘

rights, and suddenly reversed
what had been a very frustrat-
ing season for everybody in-
volved with the football team.

' “I don’t think we were over-\‘
- conﬁdent going into this game,”
‘ said Penn State’s Rip Engle. I’d

say it was just the opposite. We
were ﬂat. Look at all those mis-
takes. That’s because the boys
were too tight. , .

In the locker room coach John
Michelosen denied having the jit-'

ters while waiting for Clark to-

kick the ﬁeld goal. “I wouldn’t
have sent him in if I Wasn’t con-
ﬁdent that he could do it.” But
he was the ﬁrst person out on
the ﬁeld to congratulate Clark.
The person who deserves the
most congratulations is Kenny

 Lucas, who ended his college ca-

reer with an output not many
will forget. He completed 18 of
24 passes for 228 yards and
shocked the Lions with 52 yards
on the quarterback rollout.

“We just never expected Lu-
cas to be running,” said Engle.
“He did a great job.”

For his efforts he was awarded
the James Coogan Award for the
outstanding player of the game.

The 252 yards Lucas contributed
to the offensive brought his sea-.-
son total to 1,762 yards, breaking
Fred Mazurek’s record set in
1963. “I wasn’t thinking of his
record out there today. I never
had time,” said Lucas.

‘ Two of the reasons for Lucas’
success Saturday were Barry Mc-v
Knight and Bob Longo. Mc-
Knight"s running ﬁnally gave Lu-
cas the option he has been look-
ing for all season to counteract
the blitz. The senior fullback
closed out the year in form rem-
iniscent of last year with 81
yards on 23 carries.

Longo, who has been scream-
ing for more playing time all
year, ﬁnally got his chance when
Mickey R0soborough’s.injured
ankle kept him out of the game.
The sophomore end latched onto
six passes for 92 yards and wasn’t
stopped until the Lions decided
to double team him.

Safety Tippy Pohl, who never
gets his hands on the ball when
the Panther offensive team is in

Yogi Title Despite
Blitz by ‘The Log’

Even though George
“lVlou_stachio” Lies had his

Worst day of the college sea-
son, his 8-7 record was enough
to win‘ the Yogi championship.
“The Log” Cabin fought
gamely to the end as he went
10-5 in this week of upsets but
he fell two games short.

“Moustachio ﬁnished the 10
week schedule with a 101-47 rec-
ord. “The Log” wound up at 99-

49. They were the only two in
contention for the title going into
the last few weeks. “The Log”
picked the upsets, such as UCLO
over USC and  over Flori- _
da but faltered with the, favor-
ites, especially with Penn State,
and Princeton.

The girls ended the year in a
tie for third place with the coach-
es at 90-58. This result proved
most embarrassing to the two
sports “experts,” Jay “Flatbush”
Rosenstein and Frank .“Wimpy”
Smizik.

“Flatbush” could only pick six

could only .manage eight. Both;
felt good, however, as the Pan-
thers made good their pick of

Booters Oppose StroudsburgToday

By GEORGE LIES

It’s “lay it on the line time" for
the soccer team. Today at 2 p.m.
they battle East Stroudsburg
State College in ﬁrst round com-
petition for the National Collegi-
ate Championship at Pitt Sta-
dium. 1

One way for the booters to win

is to outscore East Stroudsburg,
but since goals come the hard
way for them, they’ll use their
1965 victory plan. That is, the
soccermen will try to keep
Stroudsburg from scoring more

than one goal.
For the forward line, this gets

to be frustrating. In every game,

The soccer team's defense did
this eight times already. and it
resulted in seven victories and a
tie. However, the booters have
not played a team this year (ex-
cept for West Chester who de-
feated both teams) who can, put

the ball in the nets as much as 

East Stroudsburg.

“On comparable scores, this
game should be even,” said coach

Panther   Leo Bemis, “butgstroudsburg has
more scorin unch than an

 , Charles Reeder of Chester,
Pennsylvania; George Stan-
‘ j ley of Philadelphia; and Bob

Renrfey of Norfolk, Virginia,
d have one thing in common.
They are students living in
dormitories at the University of
Pittsburgh at Bradford. They are
never short on conversation.

' They have a basic concern for
 improved human relations in the

world.- They are not inexperi-

enced in the manner attitudes of
men. An interview with the three
_' men ‘turned into a major discus-
"sion.
 Reeder was at Chester two
-years ago when race riots broke
- out in a town that formerly had

‘acknowledged its accomplish-

ments in uniting the Negro and
awhite community.

Reeder couldn’t believe the
» riots were there. He watched the
V brutality from behind police lines.
;.He' suspects, - however, that the
 riots were fermented by mem-
bers of the local Branch of the
3NAA_CP who wanted brutality in
’o_rder to bring a simmering sit-
nation into the limelight. Reeder
believes that the situation has im-
proved asa result of understand-
iiigs achieved after the riots.
3 A’ political science major fol-
owing a pre-law course, Reeder
walks the streets at Bradford
‘sir tudying ways to participate in

ﬁ_ e war against poverty and per-
bnal degradation. ’
' One of his roommates said,
‘H_e’ll ﬁnd ‘a slum where no one
else, can.” /
"Not prone to school activities
because they _“keep us busy,”
eder is more interested in wel-
fare "work. He would like to work
with welfare agencies in the
Bradford area -as a means to ad-
vance on a human scale that Con-
gress has been able to do effec-
'vely this year.

like asking your mother for a
drink.” ‘

The reason he came to Brad-
ford? First, Bradford offered him
an educational opportunity when
he needed it. He says he has had
excellent teachers at the small
college. But being a student at
Bradford attaches to itself the
prestige of ‘attending a large
school.

Renney became more serious
about his education as ' he con-
templated the future and the
possibility that he may be called
upon to ﬁght in South Vietnam.

“I feel strongly about the bat-
tle,” he said, “because we can’t
lose face.” He said, “We must

stand up as we did in Cuba and.

we must ﬁght as we did not in
Hungary," in effect.

George Stanley from "Philadel-
phia is from a big city. He likes
Bradford because it is intimate
and the pace of the community is
slower. “It’s easier to study,” he
said. ‘

He felt that for the United

“States to be in Vietnam is moral-

ly wrong. But, “if I go, I'd go. It’s
the law,” he said He said he did
not equatethe war with World
War II. The issues were clearer
then.

The three were joined in the
dormitory room by Bill Lott, six
foot, two inches tall, sporting a
continental beard who heard the
discussion and joined the infor-
mal meeting.

Lott’s beard attracted the at-
tention of the group. He had
heard of bearded Bietniks, he
said, but he wasn’t a party to
their ideas. “I wear a beard to
see the reactions of others,” he
said. “I like to wear a beard and
I speak out for Vietnam policy.’_’'

The unanimity of opinionrwas

his fellows. “We walk into a

there were no free elections ‘in
the country for self-determina-
tion. The West, he said, has re-
fused to sponsor a plebiscite.

Asked point-blank whether he
would ﬁght for his country if he
were drafted, Moses replied, “All

principles. It’s principles ' that
count,” he volunteered. “I’d real-
ly have to wait and see if that
happened.”

that it shbuld be stated his view:

known for non-conformity.”

Not only has Moses shown his
non-conformity in the national
scene, but he backed the losing
candidate in recent Student Gov-
ernment elections.

Moses countered, “The reason
people object to me is that I
ﬂare up vehemently in argu-
ments. They want V me to talk
calmly and to be a gentleman at
all times.” '

Moses, a resident student from

  Small Size of Bradford
Called Beneficial, Limited

Mary Ann Pappas, from Buffalo New York, is enthusi-
astic about Bradford College. She said, “I love it here, bet-

ter than most kids.”

Miss Pappas was enthusiastic about the people she has
met from various parts of the country at Bradford. “We’re .
Working to get a student union building,” she said.

She enjoys weekends, she ‘said;

‘because she likes to talk. Dis-
cussions are often long and heat-
ed among students.

Ann Connell from Westport,
Connecticut, a sophomore,’ was
less happy with her experience.
Coming from a larger town where‘

life was a ‘mixture of deb balls '

and society dances, she feels that
Bradford is too small for her.
She explained that the school

was an entity of its own, apart’

from the town.- When she at-
tended a special showing of Ham-
let at the local theater, she noted
that only college people were
