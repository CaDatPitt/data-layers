ACTIVITIES IN
JOHNSTOWN

A typically collegiate atmosphere
nas been built up at Johnstown as
the extra-curricular activities have
gotten under way. "

The students, of the Johnstown
Junior College have-already organ-
ized many of‘ the usual student

 

groups which feature the extra-cur-‘

ricular rogram of most colleges.

_ The andling- of ordinary disci-
pline,’ the establishing of customs
and the general management of stu-
dent utfairs are in the hands of a
student council. This organization
is made up this year of eight men

and two women. Mr. John D. Lamb-

ing is "its president. The other mem-
bers are‘: Messrs. Fred Brickner,
William Heslop,~Joseph Matan, Paul
Mattern, Harry McClellan, John S.
Pardoe, Fred Reinhart and Misses
Elsa Jahn and Virginia Lambert.
This group will conduct annual stu-
dent elections and through its reg-
ular meetings it is in touch with the
general problems of the student
body. Professor R. A. Sheets is fac-
ulty advisor of the student council.
-. Separate from the student council
but affiliated with it is the Women's
Self-Government Association. Miss
Sara Rhoads is president of this or-.
ganization. ’This organization has

ers is faculty advisor for this or-
ganization.

The freshman class organization
was the first to be set up at the
college. Mr. Harold Price is presi-
dent of this, the first class to enter
the Junior College. In addition to
handling problems peculiar to the
Freshman this group has conducted
a Hallowe’en dance and will soon
hold a Christmas party.

DRAMATICS

The College Players, which will
present a series of plays next week,
has a membership of ﬁfteen stu-
dents who are interested in dramat-
ics and who have shown the neces-
saryqualiﬁcations. Many of them
are known for their skill as shown‘
in High schools dramatics.
sor‘C arke Olney is the adviser of
the College Players. Theo member-
ship, all but one of whom will ap-
pear‘ on next week’s program, in
cludes the Misses Elsa Jahn, (‘- '

to -be given next week are: “Ten

stant Lover,” 23. comedy; “The Price
of Coal, a drama, and “The Ris-
ing‘ of the Moon,” an Irish comedy.
To those interested in writing,
tl_1ereVare several avenues of expres-
sion. This Journalistic work is un-
31' the direction of Professor Ford
E._Gurtis. Students write for the
“Pm? ‘We€k1Y»”.a newspaper which
all students receive, and prepare
c0lumn_sV for the local newspapers.
The “Pitt Panther,” a humorous pub-
lic.ation,,is sold locally by students
and all have the opportunity of con-
tributing to it also. Students who
show proﬁcency along these lines at
Johnstown will have the opportunity
of trying out for positions on the
publications staffs when they go to
the University. V .
The athletics program so far-‘is
centered in basketball. Professor
My_ron.Teter is coaching the group
which includes a number of former
stars from Central and Catholic
High schools and from other high
Schools in the vicinity. This is a
freshman team and will compete
with freshman teams from other
colleges. It is probable that next
year a varsity team will also be es-
tabhshed. The athletic authorities

-of the University will keep in touch

 

with the local men and they will

V have an opportunity of trying out

for the _University varsity squads. In
the spring track and‘ tennis will be
fostered.

 

_ _ DEBATING

Interest in debating was increased

varsity debating teams from the
University who conducted a debate
on the subject, “Reserved, That the

this organization" will be to‘ arrange
meetings at which the special prob-
lems of medical students can be dis-
cussed and at which local medical
men and other special speakers. can
meet with the students and help
them in planning their life work.

A marked change in the atmos-

phere of the college halls has been

evidenced since the typically colle-
giate activities have gotten under
way. The experience gained by. the
students is such‘ lines of interest is

believed to supplement in a valua-

~ PLAY NIGHT

‘Four’ one-act plays will be pre-
sented at Johnstown ‘junior college’s

DISCUSSES GERMAN
UNIVERSITY L I F E

BEFORE STUDENTS‘

 

Fraternities in German universi-
tieswere ‘especially emphasized by
Dr. Ernst W. Jockers, assistant pro-

fessor of modern languages, in his
discussion before the German
club Friday in 201 Alumni hall.
To obtain the true, traditional
life of the German student filled
with theromanticism of the Middle
Ages, one should attend a small uni-
versity such as Heidleberg and
Strassburg. The city type of
school, like Berlin, because of its
environment, lacks the background
suitable for the activities carried
through the generations. The small
town university, for instance Hei-
delberg, enables its student body to
enjoy freedom, in the broad sense
of the word, inasmuch as the citi-

zens of the town seem to make up

the other half of a large family.

’ Fraternities do not become a
part of -the student life, Dr. J ockers
states, until he enters the univer-
sity, which‘ corresponds to the
graduate school in the American
system. As soon as an individual
accepts what is known to Americans

"as a fraternity bid, he is known as

a “Fuchsen” until he has met the
regular entrance requirements which
in some of the fraternities is the
ﬂgliting. of two duels. is
second, third and fourth years, af-
initiated, he is
known as a “Bursch,” in other
words, a qualiﬁedbrotlier.

Two types of fraternities exist‘

in the German university, the “schla—
gende _Vcrbindenung,” (fencing),
and the “nicht schlagcnde Verbin-
denung” (no fencing). Dr. Jock-
ers discussed only the former type
so that he could impress on the
club’s members the real social life
of the student. The “Korps” is
one type of fraternal organization

“ which solicits for its membership

sons of the rich and exclusive fami-
lies, more or less, the aristocracy.
These individuals are usually the
survivors of the old feudal aris-
tocracy which has now given way
to the modern money aristocracy. A
second class is the ., “Burschen-
schaften” which trains its men to
be political leaders. This society
is a development of the groups of
students who previous to 1870, or-
ganized for the one political pur-
pose of unifying the principalities
and small kingdoms into tlieVGer-
man empire. The essayist, "Carl
Schulz, was a member of such a
group. Other types of fraternities
are the “’I‘urnerschaften,” the prin-
cipal purpose of which is training
in Physical Education, and the
“Landsmannschaften” which has no
special characteristics, but interests
itself in all of the specializations
of the other.

DR. JENNINGS VISITS’
BOTANY EXHIBITION

Dr. 0. E. Jennings, head of the
botany department, last Friday vis-
itedthe exhibition of the Washing-
ton, D. C., Carnegie Institute, which
represents the results of research
activities.

The local Carnegie Museum was
not represented at the exhi ition, but
the University departme t of ge-
netics and evolution of Cold Springs
Harbor, for which S. M. Cartledge
and Mrs. E. M. Brooks of the botany
department worked for several years,
had an exhibition showing the effects

that the foreign offices have’ become

they blamed for lack of “security”
comes forward with proposals for
disarmament to which they have no

More Goldens Named On
All-American Selections

‘The few weeks of All-American
picking are almost gone now and
we might be able to keep track of‘
the few teams that remain to be
named during the rest of the year.

Without exaggerating, we may say I

there are at least ﬁfty prominent
teams with Pitt men on them that

have been gathered by All-American 3

pickers this year.

The latest All-Star aggregation A

to be named is the Associated Press
team, gathered by Alan J. Gould,‘
on which we ﬁnd four Pitt players.
Captain Welch is on the ﬁrst team,
and Kerri, Donchess and Booth are
given honorable mention.

Tad Jones, Yale coach, announced .
his All-Eastern selections several :

days ago with Welch on the ﬁrst
team, Cutler on the second, and

Kern, Hagan and Donchess on the .4

third team.

Without a doubt this has been "the
greatest All-American year for Pitt
in the history of Blue and Gold
football teams. No‘ less than ten

_P_anthers have received All-Amer-. I ‘

ican recognition this year.

Warner explained that the coast
teams have been meeting eastern
teams in post-season games for so
many years that they are prone to
take it as just another game. East-
ern teams regard these tournament
games as great events and often drill
more diligently, and they are more
easily keyed up.

a comparatively weak team on the
coast, caught the Cardinals when
Warner was scouting both California
and Washington.

Pitt has a better record than the

Cardinals, having defeated West

Salesmanship Game of

Wits, Says Pitt Frosh

“A game of wits between myself
‘and the customers,” is one student’s
idea of a saleman’s job. Earning
as much as $12.87 a day as a house-
.to—house salesman for a silk hosiery
company, a‘ Pitt freshman is work-
ing his way through school.

At present his clientele includes

ninety customers, the majority of

whom reside in the Oakland district.
Included in this number are several
deans and professors at Pitt. Un-
married school teachers are his best
customers, he ﬁnds, because they are
‘always at home and because there
:.is a bond existing between the
teacher and the student.

For having the best sales record,
Pitt’s frosli salesman was appointed
organizer of a crew of Pitt men for
the same company. He has already
assigned work to three men.

Before selling hosiery, he drove
trucks,’ clerked, sold magazines,
worked in a radio laboratory and re-

ported for a paper.

‘Pittsburgh _With Strong

Team to Battle. Panthers At Stadium

Pavilion I

After the Blue and Gold basketeers have completed their four-game

campus Thursday night, go through

a light workout. and the following night, Friday, will step out on the
stadium to take on Dartmouth in the opening game of the homehardwood
Coach Carlson will have deﬁnitely decided on his starting
lineup, after having watched the -boys in the four Western encounters,
and will throw a fast, smooth-working combination against the invaders.

This ‘will mark the ‘ﬁrSl1'l}IIY!9...iIi."‘l3he_ history of both schools that
Panther has tangled with Big Green on..:the hardwoods, and the Dartmouth

boys are prepared to make it a warm meeting-. for Coach Cliff Carlson’s

proteges.

Coach Wachter will bring the big-
gest part of his ﬂashy quintet re-
maining from last year, which won,

_ the Eastern Intercollegiate League,

crown in 1927, to Pitts‘ "rgh. Cap-
tain Heep will lead a list of veterans
which includes Ellis, Austin, Spaeth,
guards; Hein and Langdell, centers,
and Vossler, forward. The invaders
will also have Swarthout, Cheney,
forwards, and Lewin, center‘, from
their undefeated frosh team‘-‘of last
year to bolster the veterans. All of
these men h-ave played on champion
teams at Hanover andthe brand of
ball they ﬂash on the_. home court
will be far from dusty. I
Three easy victories_,.over the
toughest. teams in the East have al-
ready been chalked‘ up by the, Big
Green as an indicator . of their
strength. In their opening game
they trimmed Northwestern Univer-
sity of Boston, 36-18. For their sec-
ond triumph they‘ picked on City
College of New York, which , is
coached, by Nat Holman, famous
Celtic player, who is undoubtedly the
greatest basketball player living,
and handed them a clean-cut 48-32
trouncing. Their other victim was
the reputed Providence College team
which they walloped tothe tunes of
52 to 30. In all these games the
shooting of the Green's forwards
was spectacular; Coach _Wachter
does not drill his men totry to pass
through -five'- men defenses, -but
coaches them in accurate shooting‘
from the floor. His team boasts of

ﬁve of the best shots in the East.

,, Although the Dartmouth coach
has not yet deﬁnitely decided on his
starting lineup for next Friday
night, it is probable that he will use
Swarthout: and. Vossler at forward,
Hein at center and Austin and Heep
at guard; ,.He» has been using this
lineup-‘regularly in scrimmage this
week and if they continue the fast
pace at which they are now traveling
theywill give the crowd a real treat
in the basketball line.

The game‘ with Pittsburgh will be
the ﬁnal game on the Big Green’s
week -trip, which begins tonight with
a game at Massachusetts Tech, fol-
lowed by games with Albany, Roch-
ester, Case, Akron, and the game
with Pitt.

The Panthers will play one other
game during the Christmas recess,
New Year’s Eve, Saturday, Decem-
ber 31, when they meet Ohio State
on the stadium, ﬂoor. This game,

coming asit does on New Year’s

Eve, is expected to draw a record-
breaking crowd to the under—saucer
ﬂoor./ The pavilion seats over 5,000
and. will no doubt be taxed to‘
capacity. ‘ ,

Last year the Qhioans invaded the
new Panther hardwood headquarters
and departed with an easy 48-23 vic-
tory over Captain Lissfelt and his
men tucked under their belts. Their
marvelous passing attack was the
best exhibited on the home court
during the entire season.

Refutes Prof. iSilvernian’i.s

“If Professor Silverman implies
that students are entirely at fault
when he says. that they are like "ﬂeas
-—they jump around in numerous"
subjects, then I do ‘not agree with
him,” says Dr. Annie Louise Mac-I
Leod, head. of the euthenics depart-
ment of ,Vassar, college, who spoke
on the-campus during Woman’s Day,
Friday. . '

“To whoms do you attribute the
root cf the evil?” Dr. MacLeod was

asked.  ,
“To both the student and the
teacher. How can the ‘pupil be ex-

pected to have a deﬁnite purpose if
his teacher has none?”

“What remedy do you suggest?”

“Merely this, the pupil should be
taught to focus his interests‘ around
one particular goal;- then build his
courses around this end.”

“Does that allow the pupil
change his mind?”,

“Yes, it does, providing he does
not wait until too late in his college
career to do so. The principal fault
lies in the various curricula. Too
much emphasis is put on theory and
not on practical application.” ’ ‘

QUEEN MARIE MAY COME»
ON INVITATION TO PITT

 

Possibility that Queen Marie [gr
Roumania may yet ‘cometo Pitts-
burgh through the efforts of a group,
of Roumanian students and alumni
of Pitt is the belief ‘of. Mrs... Ruth
Crawford Mitchell, chairmanhof the
committee on foreign students of the
University. J ' ‘

A group of foreign students;
headed .by Alexander Ionescu and
Julian Dragusano of the school of
mines, have organized -a committee
for the purpose of inviting-the RoI_1-
inanian queen to make a,special=trip
to Pittsburgh to receive an honorary
degree from the University. Their
idea is to prepare a memorandum on
the Cathedral, its purpose and fu-
ture, present data on the number of
Roumanian students that have at-

tended Pitt since 1914 and to send -

this data, along with a formal invi-
tation, to Queen Marie.
- G. Anagnostache, head of the Ron-
manian consular service, an alumnus
of Pitt, is taking an active interest
in the program of the committee and
has promised to aid in bringing the
Roumanian queen to Pittsburgh.

Queen Marie, while touring the
country in the autumn ofv1_926, had‘
made arrangements to visit Pitt at
the invitation of Chancellor John, G.
Bowman. The invitation wasgiven,
to the" queen personally by Ionescup
who is now working to bring ‘her
highness here. However, theI.sudden
illness of her husband, the late" King
Ferdinand of Roumania, compelled
her immediate departure for her na-
tive country at the sacriﬁce of her
visit to this and several other Amer-
ican cities.

SUCCESS SLOWED UP BY FEAR.
JEALOUSY, SAYS -DR. MILLER

“Worry, fear, anger and jealousy:
impede success, cloud happiness and
destroy health,” says Dr. Henry K.
Miller, noted psychologist and editor»
of “Psychology” magazine, who lec-
tured at Memorial Hall last Sunday.
, Inahis lecture Dr. Miller explained
in detail the things which kill the
enemies of the mind. Among these,
according‘ to Dr. Miller, are “fresh
air, plenty of water and milk, and
exercise.” “Shift attention away
