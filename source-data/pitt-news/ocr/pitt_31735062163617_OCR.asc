Of ‘Nation’ Editor

Carey McWi1liams, editor of “The Nation," America’s oldest

journal of political thought, will discuss “Automation and an
- Abundant‘ Economy” at the noon Midday Series Wednesday in
the Student Union Ballroom. . I _

McWi1liams has devoted many years of study to problems
of labor, agriculture and minority groups. He believes that
the major problem of the 1960’s is how to'run, with a measure
of economic and social efficien-

lcy, an economy of abundance
which‘ relies less and less on _,
human labor. .

He contends: “the growing '
use of automation is not the
sole threat; rather it is auto-
mation plus the population ex- 2
plosion an obsolete way of 
looking at’ the new issues r
which have come-in the wake .,
of the scientiﬁc revolution.”

Authored ‘Many Books :

He is the author of nearly 
a dozen books dealing with
various phases of minority
problems and anti-democratic
practices. When his book
“Prejudice” was published in
1944, Bernard De Voto called
it “a public service of unquestionable value.” 0 , P

“Brothers Under the Skin” was translated into 17 lan-
guages and has beerrcredited with having a marked effect
on the development of local, state and federal policy to- —
ward minority groups. _

A graduate of the University of California and -a_ two-time
recipient of Guggenheim Fellowships,’ he has written several
books on the ‘land and agriculture of California.

Besides contributing‘ to the Dictionary of American Biog-
raphy and to such magazines as “The Atlantic,” ,“Harper’s,”
“Saturday Review” and. “New Republic,” he is also a frequent
lecturer at colleges and universities throughout the country.

The approach of the “Five-Day Plan” is to fortify the motiva-

tion of the smokers to quit smok

ing cigarettes, hoping they actual- P

ly will. Then the plan will help them cope with\anxieties and prob-‘

lebs which may occur.

This ‘will be done through lectures, movies, group discussions,

and even.a “buddy system.” According“ to Dr. Thompson, “Everybody -' ' I
-will reinforce everybody else.” '

The plan calls for a substantial diet which emphasizes fruits
and fruit juices, cold showers, cold mitten frictions, brisk walks‘ and _ ,.

Student ‘Government will present a plaque
with the names of all football players to the

football team in about a month, it was announced -

at the SG meeting Thursday night.
“I think the student‘ body, in general, is thril-

led with what, the team has done this year and-

we were all disappointed that .we didn’t get a
bowl bid,” commented Marty Landy, SG presi-
dent. SG wants the team to realize how the stu-
dent feel, Landy continued.

At the top of the plaque will be the inscrip-
tion “In recognition of their outstanding football
season, the Student Body, of the University of
Pittsburgh presents this plaque to the 1963 invited
Panthers.”

“Because the whole team does the work and
not just those that are seen playing, we are put-
ting the names of all members of the squad, about
70, on the plaque,” added Bruce Coull, chairman
of the Football Award committee.

Carol “Gussie” Smith, SG vice president,
stated that she is “prone of Student Govern-
ment and the record we have this _year” and
that she feels that “all projects we have had

year.” A _ ' . , P , T .

‘ This year SG will conduct mandatory brief-

“We want them to realize how much time
and responsibility it takes by informing them
beforehand.” Any candidates not attending will
be considered ineligible.

In other SG business:

The Book Exchange will be open from 4 to 5
p.m. today through Wednesday so that students
may pick up their books or money, according
to Jack Koury, Book Exchange chairman. Books
will be returned in the SG office, 325 SU. All

A PittshurghiSymphonetta
  Shines at P.M. Concert  

By LARRY BERNFELD

The Pittsburgh Symphony Symphonetta, performed at

’ I the PM Series last Thursday evening as one would expect
from a group of selected musicians which included all the
ﬁrst chairs of the Pittsburgh symphony-—s.uperbly. ‘ /’
Haig Yaghijian, associate director of the full symphony,
conducted the program for the symphonetta. The purpose

of the symphonetta aside from
presenting good music, is, accord-
ing to conductor Yaghijian, “to
be able to bring symphonic music

‘to .places where the facilities do
not warrant the complete sym-
phony orchestra.”

“The music is an all sym-
phonic repetoire particularly
suited to an ensemble this
size,” Yaghijian said. '

The program opened with the

. overture to “Don Pasquale”, writ-
ten by the Italian composer Doni-
zetti. The initial sole passages by
french, horn and cello were not of
the precise bell-like quality that

‘ typiﬁed the piece as a whole. The
ﬂute and trumpet shortly made
up for this deficiency in their solo

 

"passages.
 ’ The sound was amazingly large
when the entire symphonetta

played together. The complement
of instruments nearly achieved
the effect of a full orchestra, lack-

 ing only the usual full depth in
the lower register achieved by the
entire symphony.

Bach’s Brandenburg concerto
No. 3 in G was for strings only.
This is in direct contrast to
Branden-burg No. ,2 presently
popular in Music 89 and In-

. terdisciplinary Humanities 8-.
This work features the valve-
less trumpet.

Schubert’s “Rosamunde” (En-
 tre Acte No. 3) highlighted the
'7 Woodwinds and later the Romantic’
3 usage of a ﬂute passage doubled

by the violins. The characteristic
dynamics throughout was an al-

“Divertissement” by the French
impressionist Ibert was an, un-
questionable hitlwith the audi-
ence. A’ delightful piece combin-
ing the lively comic atmosphere
of the circus, ;a wedding, a'waltz,~
and a/ march, “Divertissement’?
highlighted lively clarinet arpoeg—
gios, blaring trumpets and various
percussion sound effects.

Following Intermission, the
Symphonetta performed “Sin-
fonieiconcertante for Violin in
E-ﬂat Major.” Conductor Yaghi-
jian characterized the two so-
loists, Violinist Murray Feld-
man and Violist Godfrey Lay-
efsky, as “outstanding instru-
mentalists.” The tonal expres-
sion and technical excellence of
both soloists matched and. ex-
ceeded Yaghijian’s claim.

The symphonetta played softly
behind the soloists, with French
Horn passages strong and played
well. , -

ending, an appreciative audience
called back the soloists with three
ovations.

An excellent performance of
“Carmen” and ‘Danse Boheme” by

Sororitykush: An 0ldAnd Honored Custom 

Thisessay from the 1915 Owl
was written by a coed who
identiﬁed herself merely as
‘Peggy Smythe.’ Even half a
century ago a little light-
hearted ribbing was viewed as
an asset to the sorority sys-
tem. It is here reprinted for
that same purpose. ‘

Was I ever rushed by a Soror-
ity? Say, rushed isn’t the right
term. They had me on the gallop
and panting for breath. I wouldn’t
want to take a chance on another
experience like that. But say, I

had better begin at the beginning’

so you can get me straight.
You know ever since Uncle
picked up all that coin in Coal
lastlyear, he has been crazy to

have me get an education.
‘Gee! I’ll never forget my ﬁrst
day at Pitt —— for that’s where he
sent me. I thought some of the
Professors were real dears, but the
girls -— bless you — why, do you
know that a whole lot of them
were a year behind in Style and

. wore their hair straight. back in-
~ stead of over their ears and didn’t

even know the ﬁrst step of the
tango or the Castle Walk -— why,
the half of them were not even
living. -
Oh, yes, they treated me cool;
enough. Guess they thought I
wasn’t in their class, too crude
or something. But I could see
alright that they were crazy
.about the way I wore my‘ hair
and the drag I had with the
boys and the way that I could
dance. But after I was made
President of the Society for the
Development ,0 f B a c k w a r d
Young Men, and elected Repre-
sentative of the Equal Francises
,Society, my stock ‘began to
boom and I soon had them eat-
ing from my hand. So I really
was not so very much surprised
when one day.-Ellen Fish who is
one of the big bugsvin the Bid-
dies Sorority came up and put
her armaround my waist and
says, “Peggy, how would you
like to join our Sorority?’-’
“What is themthings?” I asks.
“It’s just a crowd of girls who
are all from school and who agree
to stick by each other" just like
sisters. If youbelong, you would
be a -sister to “me.” . r
“I think I get you,” I says. “It’s
kind of a Union like we had down
at the store to prevent somebody
beating our time. What’s the
dues?” A ‘
“Suppose you come up to house

for ‘supper to-night, and you can ,

meet the girls and see what kind

of a jolly" time we have,” Ellen’

says, kind of discouraged like.
“I’m on,” says I, “I’ll be there

_ with bells on.”

It wasconsiderably later in
‘the afternoon, that Hazel Heﬁer
who is a shining light in the
Pie-faces Sorority came rushing
up to me and asks, “Where are
you going tonight, Peg? Got a
date?”

“Bet, you life,” I says. “You
never saw me lay out a dull eve-
ning for myself studying. I am
going over to Biddies for eats.”

“Don’t do it,” she says earnestly.
“You won’t have a bit of a EOOC1
time, They are a poor crowd. And
this is Friday night! They always
have beans and beans only Friday
night for supper.”

’“Ca.Il Ellen up,” says Hazel,
“and tell her V011 0311,‘ “me-
Come over to our house instead.

and ice cream and lots else. The

“I believe I will,” I says, and
beats it off to call Ellen.

“Hello, Ellen,” says I. “Sorry,
old girl, but I can’t get up for the

_ eats tonight. Beastly headache and

a "little indigestion. I guess it’s bed
and a hot water bottle for me
alright.” .

“Oh, I am so sorry,” says Ellen.
“We had prepared such a nice
supper. Chicken, ice cream, choco-
late cake, candy and Oh, just lots
of things.’ Besides all we girls were
going to take you down to see the
Blindness of Virtue.”

‘,‘What! Ain’t there gona be no
beans?” I yells, about as sore
and disgusted at myself as I
could be, for I was simply crazy.
to see the ‘Blindness of Virtue.’

“No, we used to have beans on
Eriday night but we cut that out
long ago. Say, who put you next
to that?” she asks suspiciously.

“Oh,_ I was talking to Hazel
Heifer and she happened to men-
tion that you girls al‘ways
have beans on Friday night. But
say, listen, I feel better now and
I do want to see the ‘Blindness of
Virtue’ —- I believe I will come
over after all’ for the eats.

“Sure, come,” says Ellen. “But
just you wait until I get a hold
‘of that two-faced Hazel Heffer. So
that’s her game, is it? Well, I am
glad that you didn’t let her per-
suade you to go to the Pie-face
house for supper. You. sure
wouldn’t have gotten even beans
there.”

I was received at the Biddies’

0 house with as much welcome
. as an allowance from home and

found the girls an awfully jolly
crowd. The eats were swell, and
there wasn’t ever a suggestion of
beans. V .

We had just gotten to the corner
on ourway to the show when I
saw Herb Little, one of the Pitt
boys, coming along in his auto-
mobile. He stopped in front of us
and says, “Come ‘on, girls, get in.
!We’ll go for a- joy ride.”

-“Nothing doing, kid,” says I,
“we’re going to a show.” ,

,“Hop in anyhow,” says A Herb,
“I’ll drop you at the theatre. I’m
going‘ in town and you can go in
along.” 4, I .

That listened good to usand

Finally he told the other girls
they would have to get out so he
could ﬁx the differential or some-
thing. They got out and Herb
climbed in beside me, and, bless
my heart, before I knew it, he has
turned on the power and we were
speeding away leaving Pat, Beth,
and Ellen standing open-mouthed
with surprise in the middle of the
road, shouting frantically after us.
Of course, I was furious.

“Herb Little,” I says, “are you
plumb crazy? Turn back immedi-

I saw I had to make‘ the best

merely A says, “Well, I should

Show me some speed.”

And, believe me, he did.
And I was just beginning to en-
joy myself when all of a sudden
Herb stopped the machine in
front of a house in Craig Street.

I barely had time to adjust my
hair and_ put a dab of powder on
my nose (Herb is such an unruly
boy) before the door opened, and
I was carried into the house by
a bunch of girls.

“What’s the idea,” I asks as
soon as I can get my breath, “I
don’t owe Ybu nothing.”

The girls all crowded around
me, assuring me that I was among
friends ‘at the Pie—face House.
Agnes Wells and Hazel Heifer said
it was all a good joke on the
Biddies and that, if I wanted they

would take me to see the Blind-

ness of Virtue the next evening.

what could I do? I saw I would

bearings or learned the part I was
to play before there was an awful
rumpus outside and in a minute
the door bell rang and Hazel, who
had run to the window, shouts,
“Hey, Peg, duck behind the divan.
There is a bunch of those Biddies
at the door. Don’t let them get
next to you.”

y, rgfimiti-y ‘2-1’. 1964

\

Carol “Gussie” Smith, vice-president of the organization, told the members assembled
that no matter what anyone else in the school thought, it was her contention that
SG has done a good job this past year.
' It is rather obvious from the. timing of her statement — coming as it did so

I "soon after the recent articles on SG which have appeared on the editorial page of

The Pitt News .— that it was intended as a defense of the group’s actions rather than

1 %I_rgandy and Miss Smith as individuals.

Statements of the sortmade by.Miss Smith last Thursday have been uttered

 frequently‘ in the ‘past few weeks by supporters of SG, and it has cometo our atten-

.tion that there is some discussion on campus regarding the reasons behind the attitude
of The Pitt ‘News concerning SG. A number of caustic critics of this newspaper have
asserted that The Pitt News is out to revenge itself upon SG because of the group’s«

’ ’ recent ‘investigation of the paper’s policy. Others havesuggested that it is a struggle
 T‘ of personalities in which the editors of The Pitt News are trying to destroy Marty
‘A as a declaration of accomplishments. / ' '

—Both of thesecontentions are, of course, ridiculo
A ‘ nor has it ever been out to revenge itself upon SG as an organization nor upon any

us. The Pitt News is not now, V

individual in the group. This paper, however, does feel a responsibility to the under-

 graduate body to stand up for student rights and to criticize those organizations which’
,['.-do not adequately serve the students. V V
7 ' i SG, we believe, has not fulﬁlled its responsi

A bilities, and we have "attempted to
j_  point out the reasons for and areas in which these failures have occurred.

However, The Pitt News also. is a ﬁrm believer in allowing the group being
j criticized to have its say and to defend its position. Therefore, we would like to extend ‘
to SG an invitation to proclaim. its accomplishments in a special feature appearing in»?

e The Pitt News next week. The paper shall use as much_ space as SG feels it requires

to explain its projects.

a The Pitt News shall impose no restrictions upon the article except to insist. thatall
SG committees be accounted for. We would also like to see included a section devoted
"to a ﬁnancial statement explaining into what areas SG funds, both appropriations and

’ proﬁts, were injected.

If Miss Smith sincerely believes that SG ‘has done a good job this year then
there will be no question concerning the appearance of the feature. It shall appear.

If by some chance all levels
of government in the U.S. de-
cided to jointly take on the Her-
“culean task of creating within
the next few years an educa-
tional system

help to many other‘ millions of‘

Americans.

How much good would the
best school facilities and the
best teachers accomplish in the
midst of a slum? Obviously, a
good school would be much bet-
ter than'the poor schools we
have now. There would be a
dif’ference. Yet some tough prob-
lems would remain. Children
who come to school hungry and
undernourished don’t learn very

' well. Children who ha_ve no

place to study at home don’t
learn very well. Children who
don’t know the value of edu-
cation, who don’t expect to do
anything but live in the same
slum they they were born in,
because there is no reason to
hope for anything else; these
children don’t learn very well.

If we want to enable all
Americans to take advantage of
our hypothetically improved

school system we_ would have to

eradicate what Michael Har-
rington in his book The Other

America — Poverty in the rU_.S.
calls the culture of poverty. We

all know how important edu-
cation is today; we could al-
most state an axiom, “If you
want a good job, get a good ed-
ucation.” But today if someone
is born poor, his whole en-
vironment works against educa-
tion. His parents don’t read
books; quite possibly they’re il-
literate, He goes to the worst
schools and gets the worst teach-
ers. He probably receives pres-
sure from home to begin earn-
ing a living as-soon as possible.
Many other factors could be
enumerated but the general pat-
tern should already be clear.
The problem -can be ap-
proached from another view-
point. The American Negroes,
most of whom belong to and
make up a sizeable portion of
the “Other America.” are ﬁght-
ing for among other things
equal job opportunities. Yet it
is obvious, even when they win
a few isolated cases as they
have in Pittsburgh, largely
through the efforts of "the
UNPC, they _haven’t attained
their goal. How can the Negro
have an equal opportunity in
the job arena when he gets an
unequal, an inferior education,
and how can he get an equal
education it‘ he is forced into
an inferior segregated school in
the South or an inferior ghetto
in the North because he can't
buy dr rent a house in any
other neighborhood. And even

if and whenthe Negro will be

neighborhood, most of ‘them

,.will be unable to afford_ it be-
cause they don’t have equal
opportunity in the job market.
Education, unemployment and
discrimination all are part of
the sanrie problem. An attack on
one is an attack on all three, but
all three must beattacked. si-
multaneously for ‘a successful
outcome.

The American Negro has
never participated in the -Ameri-
can game of equal opportunity.
And although the poor always
had‘ a handicap, the ethnic
slums of our past were merely
way-stations for people with

‘ aspirations and hope. The new

slums. as Harrington points out,
have a permanancy about them
and worst of all a lack of hope.
lt cannot be said of anyone born
in a slmn today, especially of
a Negro born in a. slum, that
he has equal opportunity. This
makes a mockery of the concept.
Formal equality then, is not
enough. It will do the vast ma-
jority of Negroeslittle good if

' a middle-class neighborhood is

integrated because they

couldn't afford to live there’

anyway. And what is perhaps
more important is. the fact
that in spite of the formal and
legal prohibitions against dis-
crimination, discrimination will
persist as a reality for the mid-
dle-class Negro at least as long
as the overwhelming majority
of Negroes are poor, or in
other words until the “other
America” is eliminated.

This is so because any Negro
upper, middle, or lower class
is visibly identiﬁable as a Negro.
And people in our society, and
the ,world over, categorize;
white-black, for instance. They
also have stereotypes, and the
stereotypes of the Negro is de-
rived from the ‘slum Negro. Like
it or not then, the middle-class

ership and most of the rank and

Cigarette smoking has ﬁnally been declared a national health

hazard. The Surgeon General’s Committee on -Smoking and Health

has produced a ‘set of statistics that bring great pleasure to the
anti-cigarette lobbies‘ in Washington. '

A heavy smoker of many years standing can now die of cancer
of the lung. with tentimes the ease of a’ non-smoker. So what?
These cofﬁn-nail addicts have been on the smoke-
now-die-later plan "for such along time that at
best they can read down the list of statistics to

most ‘fregulars” this is.highly unrealistic. .

P The Surgeon-General’s committee (known in
these parts as Dr. Thompson’s boys) is dealing
with highly reliable data judging fromlthe repre-
sentative size of the sample which exceeded
1,000,000 men. The anti-cigarette lobby is wisely
ignoring the moral overtones which in the l920’s
led to the ridiculously ineffective prohibition of
alcoholic beverages. . -

The “pitch” of this interest group is to “educate the people.”

,The problem is where to start. Consensus seems to want to aim the

campaign at the teenéage population. What about printing the
nicotine and tar content on the back of the pack? Then again,
how many students do you know who read‘ the back of the pack
unless they are clipping Raleigh coupons? 0

These and other suggestions are backed by the best of in-'
tentions, but_ they do not, I feel, get to the heart of the problem.
(No pun intended, honest.) Teen-agers set themselves in their
ways at a young age. In fact they usually set their parents in
these ways at the same time. H

_The place to curb the habit ‘then, is on the primary school level
before it begins .-'. . hopefully. The vehicle of communication
would be the primary “reader.” ‘ '

Increase in Death Rates

The Advisory Committee on
Smoking and Health has reported
that there is a 70 percent increase
in the age—speciﬁc death rates of
males. It is slightly less for fe-
males. Their judgment is. that
“cigarette._ smoking contributes
substantially to mortality from
certain speciﬁc diseases and to the
overall death rate.’

The sessions will be run by the
Seventh Day Adventists as a part
of their community service. They
have successfully sponsored the
plan all over the country and on
college‘ campuses over the past
years.

It was first started by Dr. J.-
Wayne McFarland, physical medi-
cine and rebabilitation specialist,
and the Rev. E. J. Kolkenberg, a

    West Virginia, 25-2;
Tie Highlights [Watch

A By BOB SMIZIK ‘
West Virginia met the Panther wrestlers for the ﬁrst
time in six years Saturday at Fitzgerald Field House and

left wishing they had never renewed the series as Rex
Peery’s‘team humbled the Southern Conference champ-R

The manner in which West Virginia scored its two

points was the highlight of the meet
and most of the small crowd in at-
tendance probably are still wondering
what happened. In the 157-pound match
the Mountaineers’ unbeaten Jirri Jioio
and Frank O’Korn battled to a 16-16
tie. .
At the end of the match the score-
board clock, run by Horse Czarnecki,
had O’Korn leading, 16-14. But the of-
ficial scorebook, run by baseball player
Jim Yedlicka, had Jioio in front by the
same score. .

Since Yedlicka’s score was official, referee Mike Babyak

 

tied.

 

was set to call Jioio the winner when Peery stepped in. He
convinced Yedlicka and Babyak that a reversal by O’Korn
-had not been scored and therefore the match was ‘actually

But if that was the only scoring mistake made in that match
than.Horse Czarnecki is the hero of Duquesne University.
- Referee Babyak was ﬂashing more signs than a boyscout

learning Morse code and Yedlicka, working the book for the

 

ﬁrst time, was getting as confused as a novice ‘driver on the
Los Angeles Freeway. Czarnecki was not much better off. “You

had to know semaphore to get what that guy meant,” Horse later

complained.

Jioio’s 16 points represented six more points than the rest
of his teammates could score. Duff Killian shut out Dave
Cain ‘at 123-pounds, 8-0, and Tom Heniff scored. the first
Panther fall of the year by pinning Mike Gaich at 4:26 to
keep West Virginia’s offense nil in the first two bouts.

Mike Johnson, the master of the take down, was just that,
as he beat Bill Meacci, 12-6, at. 137 pounds. Like last season,

however, Johnson showed an inability to successfully ride his op- .

. ponent.

In other matches Dino Boni remained unbeaten by a decision-
ing George Walter, 7-1, at 147 pounds; Tom Baily beat Bart Bion-
dolillo, 5-0, at 167-pounds; Lee Hall won his fourth straight at
.177-pounds by whipping Roy Sisler, 8-2; and Ken Barr trounced
Ken Woodenshick at heavyweight, 8-1.

Give Army coach Taylor
Locke Cal Sheffield and
Dave Roman and he would
have_ a great team. After his
team lost to the Panthers, 86-64,
at the Field House Saturday
night, Locke said, “Pitt’s guards
beat us. Our ‘four loses this

guards couldn’t defense the op-
position.

“We haven’t been beaten up
front all year. All our team

shoot and play defense the way
Pitt’s guards do and we would
have a great team.”

Sheffield led all scorers with

'26 points. He shattered Army’s

man to man defense by con-

tinually driving and caused the

' Cadet’s Bob, Seigle to foul out
with only one point.

Sheﬁield made 12 of 13
from the foul line as he led
Pitt to a Field House record
for free throws made—40. In
making 40 of 48 from thefoul
stripe, the Panthers broke the
old record of 39 set by Geneva
in ' the 1952-53 season.
_Roman continued hitting at a

near 50 per cent clip from the
ﬁeld as he made seven of 15
shots. It was his three baskets
in a row with 4:40 left in the
game that gave the Panthers
a commanding ten point lead.
Locke also said that Brian
Generalovich was a great play-
er but that he knew Mike Silli-
man could hold him. “Sl1liman

Traekmen Take Distant Second

To Army in Triangular Meet

.f_ Disaster was the word that best described what happened
as the Panther track team opened their indoor season against
Army and Rutgers in a triangular meet at West Point Sat-

urday afternoon.

The Panthers came in second, but were swamped by
Army, 83-37, because of a lack of depth. Rutgers ﬁnished
with 23 points. Although several bright individual perform-

. ances made up the Panther total, Army’s depth proved fatal

in the ﬁnal analysis.

Four individual events were

won by Panthers. Bill DelVecchio
won the 60-yard dash, Joe Friend
won the 60-yard hurdles, Luddy
Hayden won the broad jump, and
the mile relay team won in 3:19.4.
The Panthers were hampered
by the plane flight from Pitts-
burgh to West Point. “It was a
very rough flight. Most of the
~ boys got sick, and some of them
were very weak for the meet,”
said coach Carl Rees. “The dis-

Didn’t Have A Chance

Unfavorable Odds No

  Bother To

Larry Szykowny’s chances
of breaking into the start-
ing lineup of‘ the Panther
basketball team this season

seemed about as good as Charles
Finley’s chances are of being
elected commissioner of base-
ball. » i ‘
Due to scholastic ineligibility
last year, Szykowny did not
play freshman ball. This year
he had the dubious task of beat-
ing out four senior letter win-
ners to break into the first team.

But by the eighth game of
the season Szykowny had
made the starting lineup and
in the process had beaten out
Dave Roman, Tim Grgurich
and C.Q. Larkin.

Hot-shooting Roman has since
put .Szykowny back on the
bench,_‘but this doesn’t mean
that the North Catholic High
grad isn’t seeing ‘plenty of ac-
tion. I

. Coach Bob Timmons likes to
alternate his guards andwunder
such a system, Szykowny is see-
ing almost as much actionas
regulars Roman and Cal Shef-
ﬁeld. _

Despite his rise to promi-
nence, Szykowny is far from
satisﬁed with ‘his perform-
ance. “I’ve got to get my
shooting touch back,” he said.
Szykowny’s shooting -has been
hampered by a broken arm he
suffered before the season
started. He missed much of I
the pre-season practice but

  Szykowny

 

was ready to see limited ac-. ‘ ' 

tion in the season-opener,
against Fairfield.

Although he’s‘ concentrating

on this. season and hoping the,
Panthers will get a tournament-
bid, Szykowny can’t help but
wonder about next year when
the Panthers lose their entire
starting team. ‘

“People say the reserves are
bad because we only play a lit-
tle bit-, and‘ it’s tough to show
anything" when you’re onlyi n._for
so little time,” Szykowny said.
“But-I think we’ll be okay next
year.

Freshman Cagers
Defeat Kent State

The freshman basketball team,
with,-same ﬁne shooting and re-
bounding, built up. an‘ early 15
point lead, and then hung on,- to
stave off at strongrally. by the
Kent State Frosh to win,v53-50,
last Wednesday night at the Field
House. A « A .

The victory was the fourth in
their last five games for the Cubs,
and gives them -a season’s record
of 4-2 with eight games still, re-
maningron the schedule.

Stan Falenski, who is making
a habit of beinghigh scorer, led
the team ‘ again with 25_,points
on nine ﬁeld goals and six foul
shots. _

Bill McNally and Bob Caldwell
tied for second place honors with
8 points apiece-

by winning their second game
of the season last Tuesday,
a 65-36 win over the Beavers.

-40 point -surge by Miles Cohen,“

slaughtered the Raiders, 92-24.
The Friendly City Five were’t
friendly to Delta Iota Delta as
they handed them their second
loss, 65-43. .

_ Dorm action was highlighted
by Startford House's third vic-
tory of the season. Stratford

placed four men in double ﬁg- ‘’

ures as they sent Round House
to the cellar with a 74-51 de-
feat. The Counselors kept in
second place as Warren May-
ﬁeld’s 18 points sparked a" 47-40
victory over Uncle Tom’s Cabin. ._
Tom Furjanic turned in another
ﬁne performance as he sank 30
points in leading the Industrial
Engineers to a 97-56 trouncing of

’ the Metallurgical Engineers. With

this victory the Industrial En-
gineers took ﬁrst place in the En-
gineering League with the Chemi-
cal Engineers one game behind
in second.

However, Delta Sigma Phi
kept a close second as they beat
Pi" Lambda Phi, 50-25, giving
them a 2-0 record. With this
loss Pi Lam sank to the cellar
with an 0-3 mark.
