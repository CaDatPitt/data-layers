Singing Greeks  
help raise money

NIKKI SCHWAB
ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Report

.There was a whole lot of bump-
ing and grinding. \

All in the good name of charity.

Fraternities and ' sororities of
Pitt’s Greek community‘ spent weeks
preparing l0 themed song and dance
acts to perform at Friday night’s
Greek Sing.  . .

Greek Sing was held in Soldiers '
and Sailors Hall as the last event in
the year long Greek Week, a culmina-
tion of fund-raising events for. the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation.

- The event was hosted by Brian
Kelly, of Lambda Chi Alpha, as Well
as Mike Kelly, of Sigma Phi Epsilon,_
Ruthan Skelton, of Chi Omega, and
Mardie Gresco, of Delta Delta Delta.

Highlights of the evening includ-
ed when the Kappa Sigma fraternity ‘
and Sigma Delta Tau sorority paired

L up to tell -the story of a college
‘ romance “from ‘break-up _to make-'

up,” according to the event’s pro-
gram. The brothers and sisters related

‘ this tale in‘ song and dance using

music from Good Charlotte, Gloria
Gaynor and “the all-famous break-up -
couple” Justin Timberlake and
Britney Spears. L

Wedding bells rang as the broth-
ers of Sigma Chi and the sisters of
Chi Omega paraded down the aisles
and took stage performing to a matri-
monial montage of songs. Sisters
wearing short pink and white w_ed-
ding dresses held up large cardboard
diamond rings as they danced to
Marilyn Monroe’s “Diamonds are a
Girl’s Best Friend.” Sigma Chi’s
brothers, wearing suits fit for a
groom, danced with the sisters to
Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” and Billy
Idol’s “White Wedding” along with

several other wedding-themed songs.

Kappa Kappa Gamma sisters and
Delta Tau Delta brothers got together
for an evening at the ‘ Pussycat
lounge, inspired by Carmen Electra
and The" Pussycat Dolls from the
movie Charlie’s Angels 2.

The performance began with each
sister dancing seductively behind a
translucent screen. They then stepped
into the “lo'unge’.~’ wearing short black
skirts and black tops, laced in thick,-
pink thread to look like corsets. The
brothers of‘ Delta Tau, Delta wore
snazzy suits and bowler_hats as the
sisters waved fans and boas and strut-
ted, their stuff to the music of Spears,
Missy Elliott and Bjork, They con-
cluded their act with intense swing
dancing to the music of ‘the Benny
Goodman band.

It was time to go to class for the

brothers of Sigma Phi Epsilon and ‘

the sisters of Delta Zeta. They began
their school days performance by
singing Pitt’s alma mater a cappella
and wearing khaki skirtsand '+pants,
white shirts and ties while ‘standing "in
front. of a ‘blackboard. ' '

Once ‘the Alma Mater was fin-
ished, the dancers stepped away from
a blackboard, which read, “Sex Ed
101.” The sisters held pom-poms as
they danced with the brothersto the
Beach Boys’ “Be True to Your
School.” A Delta Zeta sister took on
the role of schoolteacher by day,
stripper by night, honoring the movie
“Varsity Blues.”-She grinded on a

flagpole wearing black pants and a

black, sparkling bra. The school-
inspired performance concluded with
a Sigma Phi Epsilo.n brother handing
his stripping teacher an apple. ' __

During the‘  Program -liouncﬂfsr‘ ‘
V Bigelow‘Bash on Saturday, attendees had

the chance to interact and take photos
with exotic animals, including a snake, a
chinchilla and a monkey.

But Voices for Animal Liberation, a
Pitt-based group that includes both..com-
munity members and Pitt and Carnegie

Mellon University, students, spoke out

against the animal exhibit.
Animals in traveling acts and
exhibits “endure constant stress” by

being “confined to tiny cages, and

gawked at by crowds,” VAL wrote in,a
letter sent to Vice-Provost and Dean of
Student Affairs Jack Daniel and Izabell
Musial, who was then the Pitt Program
Council’s special events director.

Musial’s term ended after Bigelow’

Bash, which is when the term usually

. ends, according to PPC Student Service

Specialist Tom Misuraca.

“Musial and Daniel did notreply to
messages left by~The Pitt News yester-
day  _ f  r  .

.The‘:~' VAL letter, which?‘ was dated

* April 1,‘-‘two days before Bigelow Bash,

urged PPC to cancel the exhibit, which
was called a “sad and pathetic display of

exploitation and inhumane treatment of

captive wildlife.” _

“The animals often suffer from tem-
perature extremes, irregular feeding and
watering, lonehness, lack of veterinary
care  andrloss of their freedom and
independence,” the letter stated.

But VAL didn’t receive any respons-
es from either Musial or Daniel, Candice
Zawoiski, the community liaison for
VAL, said. i ' .

On the day of Bigelow Bash, about
10 VAL members held a demonstration

' on the William Pitt Union patio facing

Bigelow Boulevard.

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday, April 6, 2004 _ >

First African-American
librarian, alumna honored

MARIA NICOLE SMITH
For The Pitt News

Tamika Maddox stepped back in
amazement as the crowd of about 30
people yelled, “three .. two  one,”
followed by a thunderous round of
applause. It was then that a newly dedi-
cated plaque was unveiled last Friday.

The commotion and'emotion were
for the dedication of a plaque honoring
Virginia Proctor Powell Florence, the
first African-American woman to
receive professional training as a librari-
an.

“I never thought this day would
come to pass,” Maddox said before the
unveiling. From 2001 to 2002, she
served as the chair for the Minority
Concerns Council at the School of
Information Sciences.

Florence earned her degree from
Pitt’s School of Information Sciences in
1923.

As part of an assigmnent to create
an annotated bibliography, Maddox
found an article about Florence’s experi-
ence as a librarian. According to the arti-
cle, Florence did not even know sheiwas
the ﬁrst African-American woman to
have obtained a degree in librarianship.

Friday’s occasion was not only a
time to recognize diversity within the
University, but also a time to reﬂect on
the school’s history ofﬁrsts.

According to Ronald Larsen, dean
of the School of Information Sciences,
Pitt offered the ﬁrst place for teaching
children’s librarianship more than 100,
years ago.

Information science ' student,
Rachelle Shells added that, “Pittsburgh
has a lot of ﬁrsts, and it feels good. to be
a part of it.” ;

Shells went on to mention Tywanna
Whorley, a future ﬁrst from Pitt. -She
will be the first black person to receive a
doctorate in archiving.

Present at the dedication was the
author of the article that inspired
Maddox to honor Florence at Pitt,
Arthur Gunn. Also in attendance was the
ﬁrst black president of the American
Library Association, Dr. E.J. Josey.

The honored guest at the dedication,
Dr. Carla Hayden, also delivered a
speech a few minuteslaterrinthe English
Room of the Cathedral of Learning:
Hayden was the second African-
American woman to be president of the
American Library Association in the
organization's 127-year history.

After the nostalgic and emotional
dedication, the crowd, consisting pri-
marily of SIS students, walked to the
Cathedral and sat in a room decorated
with coats of arms for English authors

such as Jane Austen and Charles
Dickens. The quote engraved in the wall
was William Shakespeare’s and it read,
“Once you learn to read, you’ll be for-
ever free.”

Framing her speech, “Equality and
Liberty in Libraries,” around the occa-
sion of the 50th anniversary of the his-
toric Brown vs. the Board of Education
of Topeka, Ks., Hayden posed the ques-
tion: Are citizens able to receive equity
in their information seeking, particularly
in library settings? , I

As the director of the Enoch Pratt
Free Library in Baltimore,‘ Md., Hayden

described her consideration of that ques-

tion in relation to her position. -—~ "

“Fifty percent of_ the state’s people
that live in poverty, live in Baltimore
city,” Hayden said. “['I'here is] a 38 per-
cent illiteracy rate. What is a library
when people in the city canft read?”

Hayden went on to say that a library
in those conditions has to play ‘a part in
bringing information and access to the
community. This is what most of the
people gathered to hear her speak aspire
to do — provide people with accessible
information.

When asked about the relevance
that access to information has on an
average student Hayden responded that
students would realize the importance if
they had to prepare for a course or write
a paper without information. Going on
the Internet or to a library is usually a
student’s ﬁrst step in locating informa-
tion.

“People who are information spe-
cialists prepare and package the infor-
mation for people to use in every kind of
ﬁeld,” Hayden said. “We not only have
to prepare the information, we have to
protect the people’s right to have it,”

She added that if librarians do not
continue to ﬁght for people’s right to
have access to information, the govern-
ment will increase its intrusion. '

Librarians are currently concerned
with people’s right to ﬁnd information
freely without fear of the government
watching them, and they are becoming
more and more vocal with regard to this
concern. A

Librarians were the ﬁrst group to
take a stand against the USA PATRIOT
Act, arguing that it infringes on citizens”
access to information. The librarians’ ‘
position led to the stereotypes of librari-
ans, a predominantly female occupation,
as being “hysteric for freedom,” she
said. It also led the editorial board of
Ms. Magazine to nominate Hayden one
of its 2003 Women of the Year.

According to.Hayden, it was a spe-
cial honor to speak after the dedication
of the plaque to honor Florence.

Pitt’s writing program ended this
year’s Contemporary Writers Series with
5 “spectacular” evening of poetry. "

Jeff Oaks, a professor in Pitt’s

English department, opened the reading
by explaining that the writing program
was ending the series “in a spectacular
way with three spectacular poets.”
\ Elizabeth Alexander, Harryette
Mullen and Marilyn Nelson read selec-
tions of their poetry Thursday.«night in the
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.

Toi Derricotte, a Pitt poetry profes-
sor, introduced the night’s readers as fam-
ily.

All three women are members ‘of
Cave Canem, the first national work-
shop/retreat for African-American poets,
which Derricotte co-founded.

“I’m proud of the quality of writing

adding that the ‘poets who attend the
workshop are quite diverse.
“You will hear some of that diversity
tonight,” she told the audience.
Alexander received a _National
Endowment for the Arts fellowship
A among other awards and currently is a fel-
low at the Whitney Humanities Center at
Yale University.
Alexander read a new poem about
the 1839 Amistad incident, in which 53
Africans, who were taken from Sierra
Leone and brought to‘Cuba in violation of
international law to ‘be sold as slaves,
revolted on the Amistad ship and ended
up in New Haven, Conn. .
There the Africans were charged with

in Cave Canem poets,” Derricotte said, ’

Poetry reading ends series

murder and piracy but were freed after a
trial and allowed to return to Sierra Leone
as missionaries. . '

Mullen has received two artist grants

and other literary awards and fellowships. _

She now teachesAfrican-American liter-
ature and creative writing in the English

department at the University of California V

at Los Angeles.
Mullen read some old and more

recent‘ poetry, including two poems in

honor of Derricotte, with whom Mullen
and a group of other writers went to Cuba.
Mullen also read the title poem from her
book, “Sleeping with the Dictionary.”

“Yes, I have been known to fall,

asleep with thetdictionary and wake with

-. it poking me in  ” Mullen said.

She paused.

“My back,” she continued. The
crowd responded with laughter.

Nelson, named a Connecticut state
poet laureate, ended the reading with
poems addressing such subjects as
George Washington Carver and the
lynching of Emmett Till.

A Nelson has been a professor of
English at the University of Connecticut,
Storrs, since 1978 and has received many
awards and ‘fellowships, including the
Guggenheim Fellowship. 1

Though this was the last reading of
the series, itrwas not the last reading of the
term, Oaks said.

The English Department’s Faith
Adiele will be giving a reading in cele-

bration of I her newly published book .

“Meeting Faith: The Forest Journals of a
Black Buddhist Nun” on April 6 at 7 p.m.

in the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium. The I

event is free and open to the public.

Madeleine Adam, a Point Park
University ballet instructor, and Bob
Pilon, a representative from the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation judged the event.

“You guys are so fun  so fun,”
Williams said, waiting to announce
the winners. A

Williams remarked on the amount
of energy that all of the 10 groups put

’ out, but the judges decided to give L
Best Original Performance to Kappa '

Sigma and Sigma Delta Tail for
“From Break-Up to Make-up.” Best
singing went to Sigma Chi and Chi
Omega. Best dancing was given to
the Pussycat lounge performers,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Delta Tau
Delta. ‘ A

9 ‘Overall, Sigma Chi and Chi
Omega were given third place, Sigma
Phi Epsilon and Delta Zeta were

given second place and Kappa Kappa
Gamma and’ Delta Tau Delta won
Greek Sing with their first-place per-
formance. _

“I had an awesome_time. By the
end it was the people who smiled and
really sold it [who won],” Williams
said. “It really relates to school spirit
and‘ Greek spirit.”

Williams also said that she gave
every act a perfect score for “appro-
priateness.” ' A g ‘

_ By the end of the night the
Greeks raised $8,133 for the charity.

Lee Kimball, the university

development coordinator for the

‘Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS

Foundation was enthusiastic about
the Pitt Greek community.

having they really show their leader-
ship‘ on campus,” Kimball said,‘ “It’s

to leave University property if they want-
ed to continue demonstrating.
“If you want to do something as a

student group, you have to reserve space

to do it,” Misuraca said in an interview
yesterday.

The group was told that they could
demonstrate on the sidewalks of Forbes
and Fifth Avenues, he said.

“If they’re out on the sidewalks,
that’s their -right [to protest]',” he added.

' VAL demonstrators moved to the
sidewalks and‘ passed out leaflets to
passers-by. M ’

Zawoiski said that many of the peo-

A ple posing with the animals probably

were not aware of the conditions the ani-
mals lived in.

VAL also sent Musial and Daniel
copies of some 1998 and 1999 USDA
inspection reports of speciﬁc Animal
Rentals, Inc. sites.

An April 1998 report of a site only.

referred to as Site 001 [detailed a black
lamb that was in “need of immediate vet-
erinary care.” The lamb was unable to

. stand and-had not eaten or drank for at

least three days. In the same report, a pri-
mate was described as having “bare
patches’ on his arms and across his hips.”
Misuraca defended PPC’s' decision
to use Animal Rental, Inc. by pointing
out that the report was six years old.
“People get some things wrong and
they correct them,” he said. A
The following USDA report of the
same site, taken in February of 1999,
stated that the primate had been exam-

SPPC defends decision“ to have animals

ined and the lamb had seen a veterinarian '

and‘ was euthanized the day after the
April report had been taken.

‘The primate was found to be in a
“relatively healthy condition for his age
[of 26 years],” a North Avenue Animal
Hospital document stated.

“There is no evidence of loss of hair
due to self-trauma or mutilation,” it con-
tinued. .

Misuraca said he called the local

, USDA inspection office‘ and asked them

to call him back if there was any problem
with Animal Rental, Inc., and he didn’t
receive a call back. A

He also made sure Animal Rental,
Inc. was certiﬁed by the government to
display animals, Misuraca said.

PPC also received a fax from the

People for the Ethical Treatment of .
Animals as well as an e-mail from a Pitt

alumnus who urged them not to have the

exhibit, Misuraca said. " I ,
The students and advisors of PPC

discussed the issue, he said, but the stu-

- dents decided to go ahead with the exhib-

1t.

who demonstrated with VAL ’ on
Saturday, said -that he is optimistic that
VAL will get their message across to the
campus.

VAL is also urging the PPC to adopt
a formal, written policy that would ban
live animal exhibits at PPC events.

Groland said that he is prepared to
start a “call—a-day” campaign in which
VAL members call the ofﬁces of Daniel
and the new ~PPC special events'director,
who Misuraca said will be Emily Yosd.

Shockingly, toomuch TV bad for kids

A study appearing in the April edi-
tion of the journal Pediatrics has sug-
gested a link between television view-
ing in toddlers and attention deﬁcit dis-
order later in life.

The govemment-sponsored study
used data from 1,345 children placed
into two groups, 1- and 3-year-olds at
the outset of the study, and asked their
parents about television viewing habits
and perceived attention problems in the
children at age 7. The children hadn’t
been diagnosed with any disorders, but
previous studies have shown parents’
perceptions to be mostly accurate.

Every daily hour of television
watched by the subjects correlated to a
10 percent increase in attention deﬁcit
disorders, possibly because the over-
stimulation of developing brains can
permanently rewire the brain, as it has
been deﬁnitively shown to do in new-
born rats.

None of these ﬁndings are surpris-
ing in the least.

The American Academy of
Pediatrics recommended in 1999 that
children under 2 should not watch tele-
vision at all. Common sense, and not
expensive government research, should
have allowed that recommendation to
become a rational part of child rearing
wisdom. ’ '

Attention deficit disorders are a rel-
atively new phenomenon, and televi-

sion’s prevalence as a third parent has
been rising, too. Children naturally are
wildly imaginative, and if they are
merely plunked in front of a television,
that fertile mental soil just lies fallow.
Kids have so many more television
options open to them thanks to the
advent of cable. It’s unlikely that a kid
today will be unable to ﬁnd something
to watch, and give up _and go play with
the dog. But, if television time is close-
ly monitored and kept to a minimum,
children are always capable of coming
up with something amazing to amuse
themselves. ’
What ever happened to imaginary
friends, to running around getting mud
in your hair? Story time was a wonder-

s ful part of many a childhood, and often

led kids to lifelong reading habits them-
selves.

Jennifer Kotler, assistant director i‘
for research at Sesame Workshop,_

which produces educational children’s
programming such as Sesame Street,
questioned the study’s lack of emphasis
on the content of~the television the chil-
dren watched. The quibble is valid,.to a
small degree: it’s probably better for a
child. to watch old episodes of Mr.
Rogers’ Neighborhood than Robocop.
But in reality, no child should spend
hours in front of the idiot box when a
whole world of crazy kid, ideas and fun

"is rightoutside the door.

Even broke college students can eat with celebrities

Whether you are a starving
Ethernopian, possess a bountiful,
Star Jones-like physique, or cram
MetRx alongside Mariusz
Pudzianowski, it is a good bet that

food and food “processing” occupy,

a goodly percentage of your daily
life. You may frequent —Eddie’s, or
work in a restaurant, or simply be a
gourmand; either way, you eat, you
digest, you poop. I

' Recently, researchers spent 600
trillion .taxpayer dollars and 17_tax-
payer cents in a study that suggested

that food may be “essential” to life.‘

Having learned this, we decided to
offer some recipe suggestions for
lazy, po’, or just plain gluttonous
college students. Not everyone has a

Foreman Grill, or its Korean equiv-_

alent,=but with a few simple kitchen
tools, a few dollars and a little good
old-fashioned America-nftingenuity,
assuming it has not been pounded
out of you by years of forced indoc-
trination at the hands of a teaching
staff ‘that has been trained by videos
from Dr. Mengele’s Educational
Institute, thereby rendering you so
meek that you still feel the need to
raise your hand to go to the bath-
room even in "important business
meetings and while on dates, you
can easily make any of these meals!

Without further ado, here are our
favorite cheapo recipes, with
celebrity names attached to make
them even more mint!

Measure 1 cup of regular or

whole-wheat couscous into a large
mug orbowl. Add the veggies,
the PCP, and the soup mix. Stir and
add about 1 cup of boiling water.

‘Cover and let sit for aboutV5 min-
utes, and get a prostitute to entertain,

you while you wait for the drugs to
kick in. Murder the whore in an
unstoppable PCP—fueled rage, and
then eat the delicious couscous with
a fork. Best when enjoyed while lis-
tening to the Edgar Winter Group’s
“Frankenstein.”

NOTE: Do not stabs self with
fork while on PCP. It won’t hurt, but
the resulting scars will lead to prob-
lems in the job.market. Also: Killing
whores is generally considered ille-

gal, unless of course you have diplo-'

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

PAGE 7

 Melt Banana Will

heat it up at Nick’s

As the semester draws to a close, and
we witness the end of Club Laga, a few
venues around Pittsburgh are still
kickin’. J apan’s ﬁnest spazzcore/noise
rock act Melt Banana will be coming to
town with Mike Patton’s side project,
Fantomas, on Thursday night. The show
begins around 8:30 p.m., so it’s nice for

. people to be able to sneak out for a show .

before ﬁnals comes up in a few short
weeks.

Melt Banana is probably more popu-
lar here in the states compared to their
home of Japan. Contrary to popular
‘belief, vocalist Yasuko O. sings, screams
and speaks in machine-gun English
phrases. Most think that she does this in
her native Japanese tongue, but it is in
English.

Guitarist Agata is the band’s most

. unique member. While the rest of the

band members have their own quirky
secrets, Agata wears a surgeon’s mask, or

some other form of mask, at every show.
This is because he is rumored to have a
communicable disease, which only lets
him remove his mask when he’s eating.

It remains on him for the rest of the time. . J

Melt Banana’s latest album, Cell

‘Scope, is a lot more accessible than their

previous material, but still difficult to get
into for those without an open mind. If

' you want a real raw example of what

they do, pick up their seminal Speak
Squeak Creak, which was mastered by
Steve Albini (Smashing Pumpkins,
Shellac, Nirvana, Mogwai and many
more). Their live shows are energetic and
frantic, especially with covers. Imagine
their sound to be similar to the Beach
Boys’ “Surfm’ U.S.A.” Fantomas’ lat-
est release is the full-length Delerium
Cordia. The band features ex-Faith No
More vocalist Mike Patton, who has
been extraordinarily busy as of late.
Patton has spent -a great deal of time

working with his other side projects,
which include Tomahawk (and their phe-
nomenal 2003 release, Mit Gas), as well
as an EP with the Dillinger Escape Plan
last year. The band also features ex-
Slayer drummer, Dave Lombardo. But

the only way to really describe thisband,
which formed from the ashes of Faith No i

More in 1998, is weird. It’s not the same
kind of weird, which Melt Banana brings
to the table, but rather its own unique

brand, which adds much ﬂavor to the
whole show.

If you’re looking for something
besides all that boring rock and think that
Laga’s closing was the end of the
Pittsburgh concert life, you need to get
yourself down to Nick’s Fat City this
Thursday. It promises to be a wonderful
night of wackiness and raw energy
onstage. See you kids there.

Kill Henry Sugar sings old countrylikel ohnny

Love Beach

Kill Henry Sugar

Surprise Truck Entertainment
7’.‘n’.‘r1/2

Recommended if you like: Johnny Cash

 

Listening to Henry Sugar is like sitting down for
a cup of coffee‘ with an old friend. It’s comfortable" arid
simple storytelling, old country-like Johnny Cash. It’s
best described as a combination between alt country

and folk.

COURTESY GOODCOPPR.COM

Kill Henry Sugar is
made up of Erik Della
Penna and Dean
Sharenow. Penna does all
the strings of this project
ranging from banjos to
acoustic guitars to elec-
tric guitars. Sharenow
plays a drum kit creating

 different sounds using

brushesand other objects
to create a fusion that is a
big sound for a little
band. V

Both of their jobs’
before their collaboration
consisted of playing for
large crowds with artists .
such'as Natalie Merchant
and Joan Osborne. They-
met while on tour with
Joan Osbourne and real-
ized that they had the
same musical aspirations. '

There started Kill Henry Sugar. Both reside in New
York City, but you would have never guessed it with
their southem-inﬂuenced sound.

Their ﬁfth album together, Love Beach (set for
release June 15), is an acoustic country-meets-blues
infusion. The intro to the album, “Viking Burial,” has
a bluegrass feel to it while the snare drums keep the
steady beat ﬂowing.

“Company We Keep” and “Middle of the Day”
are personal favorites on the album. They are soft lul-
labies with smooth vocals, soft drumbeats and lazy
strumming of guitar. They are perfect songs to listen
to calm and sooth you down.

“Cold Was the Ground” brings the alt country to

p the album. With a touch of electric guitar, this is their

most powerful track on the album.

Their versatility from track to track is caused by
their imaginative use of sound. Their lyrics are raw
storytelling, almost as open and honest as country, but
more insightful. Their musical talents bring in a com-
bination of guitars, drums and piano, intertwined to
create well-crafted, mellow beats.

You can catch Kill Henry Sugar on May 11 at The
Quite Storm Coﬂeehouse, 5430 Penn Ave. For more
information, call (412) 661-9355."

So drop the act, boys. And don’t

The Sleepy Jackson never gets tired of trying new things

OK,""_I got it. The Sleepy Jackson
sounds like Galaxie 500 “cove-ring
Blur. No no, they sound like the
Flaming Lips covering Wilco. No
wait, I really got it this time. They
sound like Air and Pulp getting
together to play Johnny Cash songs.

Either way, it’s clear that Western
Australia’s The Sleepy’ Jackson
thrives on chameleon-like shifts from
one pop influence to the next, And
while these inﬂuences seem so easy
to pin down on first listen, there also
seem to be too many of them to point
and fingers. Their music, then,
becomes somewhat of a celebration
of a feedbag of artists and pop inno-
vations, from Woody Guthrie through
John Lennon, from blues to‘ jangle
pop. Eventually, the music filters
itself through the unique disposition
of The Sleepy Jackson front man
Luke Steele, whose ear for saccharine
textures and inviting choruses is
impressive. .

Take Lovers, the group’s 2003
debut. It starts with the dreamy femi-

nine chants and digital orchestra of '

,L0vers,

“Good Lovers,” segues into the

brooding boogie-woogie jam of
“Vampire Racecourse” and then to
the electro—country of “Rain Falls for
Wind.”

Elsewhere, Steele is unabashed in
breathy backing

use of petal steel,
vocals and
heavy elec-
tronic filters;
in his reliance
on a simple.
“na na na” to
carry a song’s
melody. The
most notewor-
thy aspect of

though, is its
a b" s o l u. t e
meticulous-
ness. ' While
S t e e 1 e ’ s
melodies never
fail to catch
the ears, it’s
his careful
attention to

detail that makes each song worth
remembering. ' '
Steele, then, could be considered
one of modern Pop’s most promising
artists. He’s no John Lennon, Damon
Albarn or Wayne Coyne yet, but his
potential foreshadows a day when he

may be. '
The Sleepy Jackson will play a 21-
and-over show at the Rex Theatre—0n
the South Side on Tuesday. For more
information} call (412) 381-681].

The collegiate careers of Pitt gym-

nasts Diandra O’Connor and Alyse
Zeffiro came to end on Saturday, but
not the way they wanted them to.

The pair finished out the season at
the NCAA Northeast Regionals, with
O’Connor finishing 13th in the all-
around with a total score of 38.625 and
Zeffi_ro ending up 15th on the vault and

myself,” Zeffiroi said. “It wasn’t my
best performance. My vault was great,
but I didn’t.do my best on the ﬂoor
exercise.” .

Zeffiro received a 9.85 on the vault,
giving her a total of 127.25 points in

that event on the year, , breaking her’

oyvﬁ record of 126.4, whichshe set in
2002. With a 9.725 on the ﬂoor, Zefﬁro
became the 15th gymnast in Pitt history
to reach the 1,000-point plateau.

“I was a little anxious, and I ended
with, my chest down,” she said about
her performance on the floor. “I was a
little nervous. It was hard without my

team there  I’m glad that I, ended on

a good note.”

O’Connor ﬁnishes her career with
1,375.9 points, fourth most in school
history. O’Connor tied for 35th on the

couple of doubles for the Wildcats in

give them the final four—run lead.
“Their pitchers did a good job of

Phalen.

Because of the temperature outside,

it may be hard to believe, but Major
League Baseball is officially back.

\I guess baseball returned last
Tuesday when the Yankees and Devil
Rays opened up in Tokyo, but to me, it
has officially returned Sunday, since
games are now being played on

American soil

Even though the weather is still very
frigid, the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore
Orioles opened up their season Sunday
night in Baltimore. That means baseball
is here to stay for the next six months.

Even though off-season changes will

make this season exciting, it is too early »

to tell who is going to win the World
Series, but based on Sunday’s game in
Baltimore, it has become a little clearer
that it is possible that all of the teams in
the American League East, the best divi-
sion in baseball, will compete for playoﬁ
spots. '

The New York Yankees, along with
the Red Sox, are currently‘ the front-run-
ners in the American League East. I am
convinced that the team that wins the
wild card spot for the playoffs will come
from this division. And it is not too far-
fetched for another team in the East other
than Yankees or Red Sox to at least
secure the wild card spot.

Both teams made big moves during
the off-season, but there is one trade in
particular that caused turmoil within the
team’s organization‘ and may become a

hindrance to the team’s success. Boston d

made a lot of noise trying to acquire for-
mer Texas Rangers’ shortstop Alex

Rddriguez, while it still had All-Star 7

shortstop Nomar Garciaparra in the fold.

Garciaparra has been a steady pro-
ducer on offense and arguably one of the
better defensive shortstops in baseball.

Women’s track places first at Clemson

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Both the men’s and women’s track
teams competed -in the Clemson
Invitational over the weekend. The
women placed first in the meet with a
score of 273.50, with Clemson coming
in second with 217.50 points.

The men placed in third with
92.50 points, behind Clemson who
scored 258 points and Illinois who
scored 182 points.

“[T he women] just really stood up
big,” head coach Alonzo Webb said.

“It was an excellent meet for the
whole team.”

Women

The women finished in first place
in 12 of the 19 events. Tamara McGill
finished in first place in three events
—- the 100-meter hurdles, the high
jump and the long jump. She ran the
100-meter hurdles in 13.74 seconds
and qualified for the NCAA Regionals
in the event.

Elizabeth Bayne won the 400-
meter hurdles, adding 10 points to the
Panthers’ total. She ran the event in
59.61.

In the 100-meter dash, Kimberly

Lyles and Lamoy Stephens finished in,

first place in their heat, while compil-

.ing 18 points for Pitt’s overall score.
Lyles ran the 100 meters in 11.75 sec-
onds and Stephens ran it in 11.60 sec-
onds. Both qualified for NCAA
Regionals in the event.

“Normally, [first place winners]
don’t come out of the second heat,”
Webb said.

Lyles also came in first place in
the 200-meter dash with a time of
23.87 seconds. Stephens ran the dis-
tance in 24.27 seconds and placed
third.

Trenace Elliott earned the
Panthers 10 points when she ran the
400-meter dash in 55.38 seconds,
which was first among all contenders.
Lauren Tyler came in sixth with a time
of 57.23 and earned three more points
for Pitt. _ 4 '

In the 800-meter run, the Panthers
had no one finish in first or second
place, but they owned the third- and
fourth-place slots. Kristen Epps came
in third with a time of 2:15.14 and
Maureen McCandless placed fourth
with 2:15.43. '

McCandless also placed first in
the 1500-meter run. Her time in the
event was 4:28.41.

Pitt placed second in both the
4x100 and the 4x400-meter relays. In

Men

The men finished in first place in
only two of the 19 events.

The javelin was one of the events
in which the Panthers placed first. Pitt
also took secondand third place in the
event.

Mike Kennedy finished in first
with a distance of 69.94 meters. Tony
Bonura came in second and Corey -
Keuhner was third with distances of
64.29 and 60.20 meters respectively.

Kennedy’s distance of 69.94
meters not only qualified him for
NCAA Regionals in the javelin, but
also broke the old meet record of
68.40 meters. I

“I was standing right there when
he threw it,” Webb said. “It was a phe-
nomenal throw.” ’

Webb explained how the javelin
traveled so far that it went out of the
area provided for ‘the javelin competi-
tion and into the discus circle.

The other first place score came
from Troy Roberson in his 400-meter
run, finishing the race in 47.21 sec-
onds. He also set a personal best in the
200-meter dash with a time of 21.85.

(9.675) and tied for 31st on the floor
(9.725).

Overall, the experience was a great
one, according to Zeffiro.

“We got to compete" in the same
rotation withl[No. 4-ranked] Georgia,”
she said. “We got to watch their team,
which was a really great experience. It
was a lot of fun, although not having
the team there was discouraging.”

The Panthers set a school record

with 17 victories on the season and set .

a number of other school records. As a i’
team, the Panthers broke scoring

‘records in the vault, the ﬂoor exercise

and in total points, along with tying the
school record on the balance beam.
Zeffiro also set new school records
on both the vault and the ﬂoor, becom-
ing the first Panther to receive a 10.
She also ﬁnishes her career with six of
the top 16 all—time scores on the vault

. and seven of the top 11 scores on the"

“It has been an outstanding experi-
ence, especially this year,” Zeffiro said
about her time at Pitt. “It’s something
that I will always remember.”

Yankees make the right move

Nash, page 11

He has also been the face of the Red Sox
over the past seven seasons. When you
think about the Boston Red Sox of today,
Garciaparra is probably one of the first
names that come to mind. To him, it was
completely disrespectful for the Red Sox
to try to push him out the door.

Yankees owner George Steinbrenner,
on the other hand, was intelligent enough
to make it work out so that none of his
players’ senses of conﬁdence or ego were
hurt ' in the process. He traded for
Rodriguez and left current All-Star Derek
J eter at shortstop while moving
Rodriguez to third base.

Instead of Boston’s organization
using its brain, you have Red Sox first

basemen Kevin Millar, who’s unproven‘
' and nowhere near the ability of
‘ Garciaparra, appearing on SportsCenter

saying that he would rather have
Rodriguez on his team than Garciaparra.
That was clearly insensitive and has to

hurt Garciaparra deep down.

Garciaparra will start the season on
the disabled list, so once he returns to the
lineup, it will be clear whether or not this
team is going anywhere this season. I just
do not see this team putting up the‘ same
offensive numbers that they put up last

season. Too many of these players are,

unproven — such as Millar and the 2003
American League batting champion Bill
Mueller.

If Sunday night was any indication of
how Boston’s season will go this year,
then it is in trouble. In Boston’s 7-2 loss to
the Orioles on Sunday, the Red Sox
stranded two runners on base on several
occasions. ~

The Orioles are a team that Boston
and New York should be concerned
about. They have a young pitching staff
that is up and coming, and they had two
key acquisitions in the off-season _— for-
mer Atlanta Braves catcher Javy Lopez
and former Oakland Athletics shortstop
Miguel Tejada. Along with first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro for his second stint in
Baltimore, the Orioles could cause some

- trouble for the Red Sox and Yankees.
"Baltimore probably will not compete -

for the division, but it will have a say in
which team is the AL. East Champion.
The Toronto Blue Jays, behind the strong
pitching of Roy Halladay and the slug-
ging of Carlos.De1gado, are also legiti-
mate contenders, and if Boston and New
York are not careful, one of these teams
may get the Wild card spot and may even
steal the division.
