Romeus
done for
the year

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

The Panthers’ game against Connecticut last
Thursday will likely-be the last in defensive
end Greg Romeus’ Pitt career, because he tore

. the ACL in his right knee during the game.

“It was a non-contact injury rushing the
passer,” head coach Dave Warmstedt said in
Monday’s news conference. “He stopped,
tried to come up under the guy and twisted
his knee. It was something that he has done
a thousand times.”

The match was only Romeus’ second game
of the season. It was his ﬁrst since the season

opener against Utah, after which back surgery

kept him sidelined until last week.
v “He will work to get his knee healthy and
begin to prepare now for the NFL,” Warmstedt

said. Wannstedt also said that Romeus, who ~

was last year’s ‘Big East co-Defensive Player
of the Year, will look for a second opinion as
to whether or not surgery is necessary. I

Candidates explain how they hope to improve SGB visibility, follow through with platform ideas and boost voter turnout

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staff Writer

Onlyahandful of students gathered to hear SGB
presidential hopefuls discuss how they would
spend $2.3 million of students’ money during a
presidential debate last night.

Although the debate was broadcast over
WP'I‘S airwaves, fewerthan 10 students showed
up at Nordy’s Place, where the debate was held.

SGB presidential candidates Ben Vaccaro,
Matt Weiss and Molly Stieber dismissed issues
rangingfrom allocations’ transparencyto declin-
ing election participation. -

‘The three juniors all brought distinct plat-
forms to the debate. Vaccaro said he plans to
bring kitchens into dormitories, as well as im-
prove recycling efforts on campus.

Weiss, who has served on the SGB Allocations
Committee, said he plans to help student orga-
nizations collect funds outside the allocations
process and improve the Emergency Notiﬁcation
System on campus.

Stieber plans to continue her work with the
eBookprogram and also'implementAllocations
101 sessions that will teach students the SGB
allocations process.

The allocations class caused a bit of a stir
during the debate, with Weiss contesting that a
similar class is-already in place.

. He drew comparisons to the advisory meet-
ings SGB currently holds almost exclusively for
business managers of student organizations.

Stieber used the exclusivity of the advisory
meetings to underline the necessity of an allo-
cations class. a ' I

She said that Allocations 101 wouldbe differ-
entbecause itwouldbe opento allundergraduate
students and address topics beyond the alloca-
tions process, although she didn’t say what other
topics would be addressed. »

Stieber said her proposed class — which
would be free and not for credit — would im-
prove SGB’s visibility.

Vaccaro presented unofficial ofﬁce hours -
whichwouldbeanadditionto regular ofﬁce hours
—— as his own plan for improved Visibility.

Candidates hope that increasingvisibilitywill
boost voter turnout.

Last year, only13 percent of eligible students
voted in the SGB elections, Weiss said.

He said he doesn’tbelieve this demonstrates
student apathy toward the elections. Rather, he
sees the low tum-out rate as evidence of a lack
of knowledge. I

“It’s about gettingtheword out there. A lot of

. students don’t know about it,” Weiss said.
Because almost 90 percent of eligible vot— .

ers didn’t cast a ballot in last year’s election, the
presidential hopefuls debated ways to improve
student knowledge about elections. Vaccaro
proposed making the process more prominent
on my.pitt.edu by adding a pop-up to remind
students to vote. on election day.
Vaccaro did not mention who would imple-
ment this or how it would be done.
‘ WPTS News DirectorRichWhite, who moder-

ated the event, had some questions of his own, '

speciﬁcally addressingaproposal introduced to
SGB earlier this year.
The proposal details the creation of a Stu-

dents’ Constituents Assembly —— a body of stu-
dents elected from residence halls who would
check and balance SGB’s powers.

Stieber questioned whether the proposed
governmental body would give more power to
those who live in residents halls than those who
live off—campus.

She said she would consider the idea, though,
ifsuidents presented a strong voice for it.

“Ithinkit gives too much power to residence
halls. There needs to be an outcry from students
to have this,” she said.

Weiss agreed and said that he would need
to see some sort of petition or referendum to
approve the idea, and even then he would advo-
cate for the delegates to represent the different
schools in Pitt _— not each residence hall.

Vaccaro, president of the Resident Student
Association,.said he would supportthe idea, but
with representation from North and South Oak-
land in addition to the residence balls.

The next debate will be held today at 8 p.m.
in Nordy’s Place. Representatives from SGB will
moderate the debate. I

City Council meets with student leaders, I

Tegan Hanlon
Staff Writer

Representatives from the Pittsburgh Student '

Government Council, comprised of student lead-
ers from local schools, expressed their peers’
concerns with PortAuthorityﬁ1nding and safety
inthe South Side during itsﬁrstmeetingwith City
Council yesterday.

The City Council invited members of PSGC
to their chambers yesterday aﬂtemoon to hold
round-table meetings so they could share their
expertise in certain areas.

The PSGC is made up of representatives from
10 Pittsburgh student governments. Present at_
the meeting were students from Pitt, Duquesne,
Carlow, Point Park and CCAC.

Each student had achance to speak abouthis
school’s concerns. Fundingfor PortAuthority and
safety in the South Side were common threads
among speakers.

Nila Devanath, Pitt’s Graduate and Profes-
sional Student Assembly president, spoke spe-
cifically about GPSA’s petition that asks the state
legislature to fund transportation in Allegheny
County.

The petition went up on the GPSA website

about aweek ago. Anyone who logs into the web-
site cansend ane-mail directlyto theirstate nep-
resentative aboutfundingfor the Port Authority,
Devanath said. The names will also be added to
the petition to increase ﬁmding.

The petition cites the PortAuthoritywebsite,
which says busfare rateswillincrease injanuary
2011, and the number of avaﬂable routes will be
reduced by 35 percent in March 2011.

“Wewanttowrite aformallettertothelegis—
lature at the state level, and we want Council to
support the letter and sign onto it,” Devanath
said.

The City Council agreed to look at the letter.

“If City Council wants to see people stay in
the city, you need to show that you really care
about our transportation,” said Michael Potoc-

zny,presidentoftheUnitedStudentGovemment. y

at Point Park University.

These cuts will have a very large effect on
college commuters, Potoczny said. ',

“The student body is about three-fourths
commuters at Point Park. Some students have
already withdrawn from school in anticipation
of cuts,” he said.

The City Council welcomed the representa-
tives’ involvement in city issues.

Councilman Doug Shields said, “You’ve come

to an age where you’ve become enfranchised.
You canvote. You no longer getafree pass ifyou
get caught drinking in a parking lot. Welcome
to adulthood, welcome to enfranchisement. As

' citizens what do you want? What do you want

ﬁ‘om the city of Pittsburgh?”

Charlie Shull, president ofPi_tt’s Student Gov-
ernment Board, wants students to join Pitts-
burgh’s housing market.

Shull proposed aﬁrst—time home—owners pro-
gram, which would create incentives for young
people to join the housing market. ‘ _ _

He also discussed the need to create jobs for

‘ students currently studying in Pittsburgh. He

told the Council members they must create jobs
if they want current students to stay in the city
after graduation.

“'I‘heyarefacinghard competitionfrom more
experienced workers who have been laid o ,”
Shull said.

Whereas Pitt representatives were concerned
about funding and buying markets, other schools
brought up the issue of safety, particularly inthe
South Side.

Hally Ramirez, senator of the Student Gov-
ernment Association at Duquesne, addressed
police enforcement in the South Side.

“On Carson Street afterz am. when the bars

close, there are a lot ofhighly intoxicated people
and not enough police enforcement,” Ramirez
said. '

Duquesnewillhold a“Black Out Day” on»Feb.
17 to bring awareness to underage drinking and
problemsthat go along with it, such as drunk

The state of the South Side, especially during
the weekend, is something Pitt students should
be concerned about, Shull said. _

“We use the South Sideas arecruitrnenttool,
not for the drinking or the bars, but as some-
where where you can go shop, go to the movies
and enjoy restaurants,” he said.

The City Council was adamant about stay-
ing in close contact with the Pittsburgh Student
Government Council.

“I want to remind you that you are a_ large

, segment of this population. There are tens of

thousands of you. You have avery large voice —
organize that voice, bringthat voice_ together,’.’
Councilman Patrick Dowd said. “Practice advo-
cacy. Interactionwith organization members and

P elected ofﬁcials is the best form of advocacy.” -

Pitt approves $110 million in leases, renovations

State and federal money will cover most costs of six projects

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Pitt approved several projects duringyesterday’s
trustees meeting. But, they won’t be footing
most of the bill.

The Property and Facilities Management
Committee of the Board of Trustees approved
another $110 million for four on-campus reno-
vation projects and two off-campus leases. More
than $25 million for the projects will come out
of Pitt’s budget, and the rest will come from
federal or state sources.

The committee approved renovations to the
Thomas E. Starzl Biomedical Science Tower,
Salk Hall, Benedum Hall and a fourth project
at Langley and Crawford Halls. The University
also approved a pair of leases from City View

Properties, LLC —- one on Forbes Avenue and
another on Meyran Avenue.

The projects included $80 million in alloca-
tions from the state government, which Pitt
spokesmanjohn Fedele said was separate from
the University’s annual appropriation from Har-
risburg. Fedele said the funds from Pitt come
from the University’s capital budget.

An amount of $50 million from the state
will go to almost fully fund an addition and
renovations at Salk Hall, with a contribution
from Pittof morethan $600,000. The addition
will include four ﬂoors oflaboratory space and
ofﬁces, as well as another loading clock for the
building. Pitt plans fortheprojectto attain LEED
Silver certiﬁcation for sustainability.

Benedum Hall’s renovations will be funded
by $30 million from the state, and an addi-

‘tional $9 million from Pitt. The plans will up-
date utilities and ventilation in the building to
accommodate research at the Swanson School
of Engineering. , p

The National Institutes of Health will frilly
supply the nearly $14 million to go to renovation
of the 12th ﬂoor laboratories of the Biomedical
Science Tower. Fedele said the $13.9 million
from the National Institutes of Health was al-
located solely for that construction, and not for
any speciﬁc research project. ’

The renovations at Langley and Crawford
Halls will include a_new laboratory suite of Bio-
safety Levels two and three on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of
the hall. The renovations will include abiocon-
tainment barrier and specialty air systems to
meet the National Institutes of Health labora-

tories guide. Pittwill fund the entire $6-million

project.

The two leasesfrom Cityviewwerefor grant-
funded projects in the University’s Department
of Biomedical Informatics and the Department
ofNeurological Surgery. Together,the leaseswill
cost morethan$400,000 ayear. They included
options for the University to back out of the
leases with 90 days written notice’. _ V

John Pelusi, the chairman of the Facilities

Management Committee, said afterthe meeting —

that although the University prefers to do most
of its research “in-house,” the leases provided
a ﬂexible alternative for projects ﬁmded by re-
search grants. , i I c
“It helps the community, and it helps land-
lords who rent ‘these spaces,” he said of the
leases. “And if these grants aren’t renewed, then

it offers great ﬂexibility for the University.” I j

Facebook won’t kill e-mail

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced
that the site’s messagingsystemwill soon include
e-mail —  each user an “@facebook.com”

Accordingto The Huiﬁngton Post, “Facebook’s
latest evolution ofMessages ties in multiple forms
of communication —— SMS [Short Message Ser-

Facebook and other platforms to allow users to
communicate in real—time, on—the-go through
whichever messaging tool they prefer.” .

The new service will provide “seamless mes-
saging, conversation history and a social inbox,”
says Zuckerberg.

In an article in The New York Times, analyst
Jeremiahowyangsaid that “all of the e-mail ven-
dors should be worried — Google, Yahoo, MSN.
All of these platforms have been trying to add
social networking features to their services.”

We had to wonder why something as simple

FOREPLAY ON WORDS

Do we get more sexually adventurous as We age?

Leah Trimble finds more are willing to give ‘salad—tossing’ a shot.

Leah Trimble
Columnist

A couple years ago, a male friend and I had a
conversation about anilingus — aka “salad-
tossing,” or oral stimulation of the anal
cavity. It started with me telling him about
someone I knew receiving the act. After he
gasped in horror and I had to convince him
to refrain from hangingup on me, I told him
about an older couple I knew that made it a
regular experience in the bedroom. The girl
was in her mid-twenties and he was a little
over 30 years old, and they weren’t the only
ones that I knew in that age range getting
kinky. Though I might not act on it, I am
open to the thought of almost anything in
the realm of sexual experimentation. My
friend on the other end of the line, however,
was not. Or at least he wasn’t back then.
Based on pure hearsay and the laws of
maturity, it seems that an open mind comes
with age. People, especially men, seem to
get freakier with age. I blame it on plain ol’
boredom — the more you do something,
the less it excites you, and this leads to

more adventurous conquests. That was the
end of our ridiculous discussion.

Years later, it is still an absolute treat
when a friend calls me to report the dirty
details of their own or_an acquaintance’s
life. See, some would say I have a bit of a
nosey side to me, but I think it’s just plain
curiosity. When anyone has a story worth
telling, I’m ecstatic. Add a little extra juic-
iness and I just get closer and closer to
becoming a child on Christmas morning.
It’s very_rare that one of these tales takes
me by complete surprise. But a few nights
ago, a friend accomplished thiswith ease,
and I was brought back to the chatI had
previously mentioned. -

I was ready to hear this friend tell me
that I should bejealogs of the great sex she
had had that night with her friend with
beneﬁts. Then she broke the news. In a
nutshell, she was expecting to do it doggie—
style by the way they were positioned, and
then he just started going down on her 

only he wasn’t focused on the area she was »

used to. I couldn’t help but crack up at her
embarrassment. '
This has been a recurring theme lately.

cause it’s something that, even a few years
ago, most people wouldn’t admit to. Maybe
my old theory is correct and I’m entering

‘Glory Daze’ escape show

Kayla Sweeney
Staff Writer

“Glory Daze”

' Premieres Tuesday on TBS at _1o p.m. .
Starring: David Guzman, Timjo, Natalie
Dreyfuss '

D+

By college, every student should be well-
acquainted with television clichés. English
professors hate them — they’ll result in bad
grades on papers.

So why would a bunch of television execu-
tives sit in a room together and say, “Hey —
let’s make a television show about university
life ﬁlled with every cliché imaginable —- col-
lege students will eat it up?” I’m not sure, but
the result of thathypothetical meeting is the
formulaic “Glory Daze.”

“Glory Daze” tells the story of four fresh-

cal professor that strives to “educate, not

hot English professor is the activity of the

Of course, in order to prove their al-
legiance to the house and their newfound
friendship, the guys wind up in some crazy
antics on their very ﬁrst night — including
keg stands, stealing a painting from a rival
fraternity and ﬁnding a secret rave — but
these scenes nonetheless feel hopelessly
tired.

Furthermore, one can barely tell this show _
takes-place two decades ago: playing music
from the era and giving a few girls side pony-

My advice to you: skip this hackneyed

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Unstopp-

able’ keeps 
momentum

Azia Squire
For The Pitt News

“Unstoppable”
Starring: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Ro-
sario Dawson

Directedby: Tony Scott _ A

Film studio: zoth Century Fox
B+

Tony Scott is an easy director to pigeonhole. He
likes shaky cameras, sirens, explosions and most
of all, Denzel Washington.

“Unstoppable” isthe sixth movie of Scott’s that
Washingtonhasworked on— one of the reasons
whyit’s temptingtobrandthe directoraone-trick
pony. But this time, his formula actually works.

A Mark Bomback—penned action/drama
loosely based on true events taking place in Ohio

in2oo1, “Unstoppable” opens witl1,inexperienced,;; ~

train conductorW1ll Colson (Chris Pine) sleeping I
onhisbrothersﬂoorinarural Pennsylvaniatown.
We later learn he’s wound up in marital troubles.
On the job, he’s paired with Frank Barnes
(Washir1gton), a veteran engineer with 28 years
of experience on the AWVR railway. The duo
tries to quickly establish a work rapport, but the
task proves more difﬁcult as the movie moves
along. Colson keeps messing up under Bames’s
critical eye and Barnes remains unimpressed
with “young heads” like Colson. It’s not quite the
riveting conﬂict the movie’s trailer suggests, but

it makes for some entertaining repartee betweenss '

the two men.

While Barnes and Colson continue their pas-
sive-aggressive banter, we’re treated to a massive
mishap in another Pennsylvaniatrain yard when
another worker, Dewey (Ethan Suplee), in an at-
tempt to cut corners while moving the half-mile— *

long engine #777, leaves the train unattended I

long enough to send it poweringunmanned down
the track. .

The second half of the movie zigzags with ur-
gency through the rest of the plot, introducing
no-nonsense train dispatcher Connie Hooper
(Rosario Dawson), and hilarious railroad wielder \
Ned (Lew Temple). It’s a fast—paced mishmash of
over-the—top, edge-of-your-seat efforts to stop
the train —— or as Hooper nicknames it, “a mis-
sile the size of the Chrysler building” —— before it
barrels through highly populated towns carrying
explosive ﬁtels. These efforts are as ﬁm to watch__
as they are questionable, particularly the scene

WRESTLING

Familiar face returns, defeats Panthers

Mike Furlong
Stajf Writer

The Pitt wrestling team began its home
schedule against a familiar face.

The Panthers’ Friday night match against
No. 15 Lehigh marked the return of Moun-

itain Hawks head ‘coach Pat Santoro to his
alma mater.

‘ While attending Pitt from 1985-89, San-
toro was astandout wrestler under current
head coach Rande Stottlemyer, posting re-
cords for most career wins and pins. Santoro
also posted season records for most wins,
pins and most matches without a loss. San-
toro is also the only Panther in history to be
a four-time NCAA All-American.

After the match, Coach Santoro spoke
very highly of his time as a Pitt student-
athlete and of Stottlemyer.

“It’s always great coming back. It’s like
Pittsburgh is a home away from home. It’s
always great to be back. Always great to see
Rande [Stottlemyer] because we try to stay
in touch and we talk at least every couple
of weeks.

The No. 14 Panthers were unable to defeat
Lehigh, losing 29-7.

Returning All-American and redshirt

. juni.°rTy1e.r Naumansatoutths 14.1-p_m.md.

match due to an undisclosed injury. Nau-
man’s absence was a major loss after last
season’s undefeated dual—meet season.

“Of course when you’re missing your All-
American, it’s very difficult,” Stottlemyer
said. “Guys like Naumanlcertainly don’t grow
on trees, so we really missed having him in
the lineup.”

Filling in at 141-pounds was freshman
Mike Tully. Tully was wrestling in his ﬁrst
collegiate dual meet and lost by major deci-
sion, 16-2.

The return of Ethan Headlee at 174-pounds
after a redshirt season did not go as planned,
and the junior fell to his opponent 6-4. Ear-
lier in the week, assistant coach Matt Kocher
spoke very highly of Headlee and about his
return to the lineup for the Panthers.

“Ethan Headlee, in my opinion, is one of
the toughest, if not the toughest guy in our

- room,” Kocher said. “He’s a guy I wrestle

around with and I see a lot in him. I think
he’s capable of placing at nationals.”

In the heavyweight match, redshirt se-
nior Ryan Tomei faced off against Zach Rey,
the top-ranked heavyweight in the nation.
The match was unable to be decided in regu-
lation time and went into overtime with a
score of 1-1.

In the sudden-victory portion, neither

Ton_1ei_nor Rey. could secure a takedown,

' _ John Elster I Staff Photographer
Pitt freshman Shelton Mack looks to pin his Lehigh opponent in their match on Friday night.

and the match was forced into a ride-out in
which each wrestler was given a chance in
the bottom position to escape and score.
In the ride-out, Tomei was unable to
escape, and Rey came away with the win.
Tomei was unable to secure a takedown as

‘ time expired, and the match ended 2-1.

Despite theloss, the Panthers still have
high expectations for the rest of the season.
Santoro recognized Pitt’s talent.

“We knew it would be one of these match-
es that would come down to the wire,” he
said. “This is a team that if we wrestle again
tomorrow, a lot of these matches could go
the other way. They have a really talented
team and I’m sure we’ll be seeing them again
this season.”

On Saturday, Pitt lost another tough
match to Michigan, 17-15. Pitt and Michigan
split the matches with ﬁve victories each
but Michigan won the contest on bonus
points. '

The Panthers’ squad wrestles again on
Saturday at the Buckeye Duals with matches
against Ohio State and Nebraska. A

“We’re certainly not shying away from
the competition,” Stottlemyer said. “Both
Nebraska and Ohio State have established
programs so we’re learning from things
and getting back out there against good
teams.” I

Top 10
basketball 
teams Pitt

Tony jovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Pitt men’s basketball head coach Ja-
mie Dixon does a great job scheduling
tough nonconference teams. Pitt’s RPI
rating, which measures teams’ strength-
of-schedule and success against said
schedule, is consistently near the top
of the NCAA.

Even the so-called “cupcake” teams
that Pitt plays —- such as Illinois-Chi‘—"~i
cago — are generally the best in their
respective conferences.

In the past two years, the Panthers
have had some exciting nonconference
games, including Texas and Indiana last
year, and Maryland, Rhode Island and
Tennessee this year. But that doesn’t
mean that there aren’t teams that I would
like to see Pitt play in coming years.
So for my top 10 this week, I bring you
the top, 10 teams Iwould like to see Pitt

basketball play.

Michigan State. The Spar-L‘

And Michigan State is pretty much the

the other way around. MSU is known
