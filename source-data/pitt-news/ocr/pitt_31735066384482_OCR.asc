Hopefuls Differ on Apathy In BAS

ByJIMLEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Millidge Harris and Eric
Johnson, candidates for chairman
of the Black Action Society (BAS) in
a March 8 election, view student
apathy toward BAS in different
lights.

“None of us running are
administrators,’ ’ Johnson said. ‘ ‘So
we have to get students involved so
we can do what the black student
population wants. Unfortunately,
most of the people don't care. I just
can’t explain the apathy. My central
theme is solidarity—as black

students, we have to come together,
we have to get ourselves together. If
the students want to wallow in
disparity, they will elect the current
administration . ’ ’

“No one is apathetic toward BAS T
now,’ ’ Harris said. “There is a lot of
student interest—it’s just that there
are students involved who believe in
different philosophies. But these
philosophies believe in the same
thing-—that we should be able to
work _with people. There is peer
pressure that says black and white
people can’t do things together-
that’s why we're pushing education

now, to break down that pressure.”
Harris is the incumbent, winning

the chairmanship last year by 

acclamation when ﬁve of the
candidates withdrew from the
election. He had worked on the
public relations committee prior to
his victory.

Johnson, who has been a Pitt
student for a semester and a half, is
currently editor of the BAS Forum.

Johnson believes that the BAS
needs to be revamped.

“As it stands, there are no checks

and balances,” he said. “This

Some 70 supporters of striking
workers at Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic marched and
chanted in picket lines Saturday
afternoon during a rally at the
hospital to drum up support for the
strike.

The supporters represented

chapter of the Coalition of Labor
Union Women.

RSA Objects to,New Dorm Rates

By SUE McFARLAND

, Pitt News Staff Writer

" Members of the Resident Student
Association have expressed strong
opposition to a recently-approved
$24 increase in housing costs for
rooms in Bruce Hall, Forbes
Pavillion and McCormick Hall
cathedral suites.

RSA members learned of the
proposa from an inside tip
Thursday and called for a Friday
meeting with director of housing
Don Hughes and director of
auxiliary services Tom Albert. The
University planned to announce the

 increase Friday, but witheld at the

request of RSA which will use the
extra time to formulate alternative



methods of charging the increase.
No formal action was taken

Friday on the increase, which would
boost the price of those accomoda-
tions from $511 per term to $535
(effective fall term), but more talks
are expected tomorrow.

At Friday’s meeting, RSA
chairman Phil Cillo questioned the
validity of the increase. He asked
why ‘the price of housing in the
dorms in question should be more
than that of other suite facilities and
why RSA was not formally informed
of the increase.

Hughes said the increase was
based on the fact that McCormick
Hall cathedral suites have large
living rooms, which other suites do
not have.

“We are charging for this extra *

space,” Hughes said. “If this space
would be available for everyone on
the ﬂoor we would reconsider.
However, it can be used by only six
or seven persons living in the suite
and we believe it was necessary to
charge.”

Hughes said the ﬁgures for Bruce
Hall and Forbes Pavillion were
based on an average between the
costs of living in the Towers and the
new facilities as well as the quality
of life in and the cost of renovating
the new buildings. “In a meeting
with architect George Anderson,
the cost of renovating Forbes came

The organization representing
some 1,600 graduate employees at
Pitt voted unanimously Friday to
approve a resolution of support for
striking workers at Western Psych-

closed their meeting to the press to
discuss what was termed “sensi-

statement of support to be
presented to the University Senate

Dowﬁtown ‘Jubilee’ Offers
‘Release’ to 2,100 Participants

By GARY GOVERT
Pitt News Staff Writer

Two hundred Pitt students were among the approximately 2,100
persons who attended the ﬁfth annual Jubilee conference this past
weekend at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh.

Sponsored by the Coalition for Christian Outreach—a
Pittsburgh-based, student-oriented evangelical organization-
Jubilee was billed as “a conference of release for serious people.”
Most of the conferees came in groups from campuses in the tri-state v
area, but others came from as far away as Boston and Toronto. V
About 1,600 of them stayed at the Hilton Friday and Saturday
nights, while another 500 commuted from the local area.

Dr. Tom Skinner, author and president of Tom Skinner
Associates‘, delivered the conference’s keynote address Friday
evening. Christians must cease to view their faith as “ﬁre
insurance,” he said, and they must “come to grips with what it
means to do God’s will on earth as it is in heaven.”

Pitt Students To Meet With State Legislators Today

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Student representatives from
Pitt are travelling to Harrisburg
today to lobby with state legislators
over the status of state-related
universities in the state budget.

Representatives from Temple,
Lincoln and Penn State universities
will not be in Harrisburg today, as‘
Pitt is the only school which has
accepted the constitution of the
Pennsylvania Student Association
of State-Related Universities
(PSASRU), which is the student

out to $794,000,” Albert said. “The
University was looking for a ﬁgure
of about $500,000.” ’ .-

He stresed the fact that Auxiliary
Services is compelled by the
University to run as a no-proﬁt,
no-loss operation.

“We had to ask ourselves
whether we wanted to spend
$500,000 for another mediocre
dormitory like the Towers, six
blocks from campus, or whether we
were shooting for a high-class

operation,” Albert said. He added

that the $794,000 ﬁgure has been
approved by the administration,
and at the present time, the cost of
renovation might exceed this
ﬁgure. . P ,

worried about our projections,

them to bid on other job openings at

A representative from the
workers’ union’s national ofﬁce told
the gathering that WPIC workers
may expect support “until we have
this thing won.” Minimum strike
beneﬁts, amounting to about $30
per week, began last week from the
union’s national strike fund.

Also addressing the crowd was a,

Some 120 WPIC employes,
members of district 1199-P of the
National Union of Hospital and
Health Care Employes, AFL-C10,
walked off their jobs Feb. 17,
almost two weeks after their
contract expired. Wages are the
major issue in the dispute between
the union and the University, which
hires a majority of the workers.

In the resolution, the FAS-GSO
also urges the University ORS to
grant the demands of the WPIC
workers and settle the strike.

“We didn’t want to strike this
time,”Pete Reinnart, a striking
psychiatrlc assistant told FAS-GSO

- members, “but we’ve been ﬁght-

ing with the University for three
years now, and we ﬁnally had no
choice.”

of last year’s budget crisis.

“This is a Pitt lobbying effort,”
Student Government Board mem-
ber Stan Galanski said yesterday.
“We have the professionalism and
ﬁnance to do this. At this point it is
an individual effort.”

Today’s lobby is ﬁnanced entire-
ly by Pitt and was organized by new
Governmental and Public Relations
Committee (GPR) of student
government.

“This is the ﬁrst lobbying effort
of the new committee,”Galanski
said. P

He said the main reason for the
Harrisburg trip is
“legislative contacts.”

Mark McKillop GPR chairman,
stated that the trip involved
orienting students with state
lawmakers and the lobbying
process.

“We will be meeting withall the

senators and representatives of

Allegheny County,” McKillop
said, “along with House and

Senate leaders.”

McKillop called the effort an
“information gathering process”

increase it would be $802. Multiply
this ﬁgure by four (the number of
cathedral suites) and does it really
make that much of a difference
ﬁnancially?” Cillo asked.

Albert said the increase in
McCormick was vital and asked
Cillo if RSA had any alternatives to
the proposed method of charging.

Cillo suggested an “across the
board increase” whereby all
on-campus residents—regardless
of where they live-—would be

you 100 percent.” ‘

The ACTWU has been urging
consumers to boycott J .P. Stevens

due to alleged unfair labor
practices.

Pitt’s Student Government
Board, also tapped for their support
of the strike, still is studying the
issues.

‘ ‘I’d have to say most of the Board
is probably sympathetic with the
strikers,” SGB president Josh

‘Baylson said yesterday, “but we

Quinn. Thursday’s meeting was
the ﬁrst between negotiators since
talks broke off Feb. 15.

“We did settle some peripheral
issues, but, when it came down to

said no,” Reinhart said.

Jack Hustwit, chief negotiator
for ll99-P said a compromise was
reached Thursday that would grant
time-and-a-half wage to union
members working more than 40
hours weekly. Wording that as-
signs overtime hours to union
members rather than to what the
union called ”outside non-profes-
sionals,” was also ironed out at
Thursday’s six-hour session.

“We did make some progress,”
Hustwit said, “But when it came to

under debate in the State senate.

McKillop said about one-third
of the 16 students making the
Harrisburg trip are experienced in
lobbying.

“Pitt’s lobbyists are fairly

Pitt students in Harrisburg today
include McKillop, Phil Cillo,
chairman of the Resident Student
Association Todd Park, executive

Today’s lobby will be followed up
by a press conference in the state
capital Friday involving state
lawmaker and administrative and
student representatives from the
state-related schools.

_ Saturday morning and afternoon, conferees had the opportunity
to attend any three of over 50 seminars in nine different “tracks,”
including politics, medicine, theology and the arts. Seminar
speakers, many of them well-known Christian academics, came
from all over the United States and Canada. Topics discussed in the
seminars ranged from “Justice and the American Empire” to ‘ ‘The
Problem with the Situational Love Ethic.” ‘

Skinner spoke again Saturday evening, and his speech was
followed by a concert featuring Bill Romanowski and The Randy

Christian College in Illinois. “They had been thinking about what I

Senate Finance Committee in favor of a bill that would grant tax
credits to parents of children in non-public schools, used the issue of
education to illustrate his seminar on ‘ ‘American Civil Religion and
Civil Rights.”) '

Pitt student Marsha Scholl said, ‘ ‘It's exciting to know that there
are this many Christians and that if we do God’s will in all aspects of
life we can really have an impact.”

No further talks were scheduled
following Thursday’s bargaining
session, and Hustwit says both
sides remain far away from a
settlement.

Following discussion of the
WPIC strike, FAS-GSO president
Jim Murphy dismissed a reporter
from the meeting so the council
could discuss another issue in
private.

‘‘I’m not trying to get rid of you,
I’m just asking you to leave,”
Murphy told the reporter.

After the meeting, Murphy said
the “private” discussion centered

The Rev. Robert Long, director of the Coalition for Christian
Outreach, said he thinks the large-conference format is important

“We’re committed to this being a large conference,” he said,
predicting that next year’s turnout will be around 3,000. ‘ ‘Christian
students have a minority complex and need the psychological lift a
conference like this gives them. They need contact with people who
are both excellent in their disciplines and Christian.”

Summing up his view of the conference, I.ong said, “We’re
challenging people to think through what it means to be Christian in
all areas of life. I think we’ve been successful.”

Christy Wauzzinski, the conference committee worker in charge

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Cost Considerations

Members of the Resident Student Association have come out
against the University’s proposal to charge an additional $24 for
rooms in Bruce Hall and Forbes Pavilion and for cathedral suites in
McCormick Hall. We think their indignation is a bit misplaced,
although the rationale behind the University’s proposal seems to
leave something to be desired as well.

It makes good sense to charge more for the cathedral suites in
McCormick. They are among the most desirable rooms on campus,
and, as such, they should be worth’ more on the “market.” In ad-
dition, suites in Bruce Hall, should they prove to be attractive to
students, ought to be priced accordingly.

The double rooms in Forbes Pavilion, on the other hand, should
probably not be put in the same increase-category as suites in the
other two buildings. It is unlikely, we think, that students will be at-
tracted to Forbes Pavilion, six blocks from campus, like they will

be to Bruce and McCormick Halls.

Put simply, room costs should be determined in accordance with
room desirability, not according to whether or not those rooms
have been recently renovated. In other words, the total cost of
University housing should be evenly spread over the total number
of rooms, and then costs for an individual room should be adjusted
up or down, depending on the desirability of that room as demon-
strated by students. This procedure would correct present prac-
tices—under which a Tower C single costs as much as a Lothrop
single—and it would provide a more equitable basis upon which to
determine costs for new rooms. Desirability of the different
categories of rooms could be measured by evaluating bidding tren-
ds of the previous year. The cost of new 'residences,_not included in
previous bidding, could perhaps be initially set at a middle level and
then adjusted after that year’s bidding had taken place.

These are tentative suggestions, certainly open to criticism, but
they seem more sensible to us than RSA’s across the board op-
position to the University’s proposal, as well as more equitable
than the University’s somewhat arbitrary pricing system.

YSA Asks Support for WPIC Strikers

On Feb. 17, 120 workers at
Western Psychiatric Institute and

their employer, the University of
Pittsburgh. The workers, who are
members of District 1199P of the
National Union of Hospital and

seeking the continuation of basic
union rights. They would like to

contracting activities carried out by
the administration. Despite the fact
that the union has been negotiating
for weeks and had even remained

on the job for a week after the
expiration of their contract, the
University bosses have refused to
make any concessions.

This would be serious enough if
only these workers were involved,
but the Western Psychiatric strike
is only part of a prolonged
anti-union campaign by the Pitt
administration. Pitt is the biggest
employer in the city and.wages are
quite low for all its thousands of
non-union workers. The workers of
Western Psychiatric represent a
test case.-If the administration can
break the 1199 strike, it will
discourage other workers at Pitt-—-
including those in the faculty, staff,

and hospitals—from attempting to
organize. The administration will
have a free hand to carry out its
cutbacks in services to students
and patients, and the deterioration
in working conditions will continue.

Students, staff and faculty at Pitt
and the hospitals need to rally
behind the 1199 strikers. Some
have already done so. The faculty
union at Pitt has donated its office
as a strike headquarters and others
have joined the strike support
efforts. Help make Pitt negoitate in
good faith by backing -the 1199
workers.

A Problem With Democracy ‘In America

By GARY GOVERT

‘-‘I know no country in which,
speaking generally, there is less

‘independence of mind...thanv in

America. ’ ’
——Alexis de Tocqueville, 1835

When the author of “Democracy
in America” included these words
in his analysis of Jacksonian era
political life, he was referring to
what he called “the tyranny of the
majority”——speciﬁcally, the tyran-
ny of majority opinion. Throughout
the states, he said, the cult of
themajority was strong enough to
stifle any distinctively dissident
views. If anyone did have the
courage to publicly voice an
unpopular opinion, the majority
would loudly shout him down.
What’s more, those who agreed
with the minority spokesman
would, according to de Tocqueville,

“retreat into silence as if ashamed
of having told the truth.”

Unversed as I am in the sociology
of Jacksonian democracy, I am
reluctant to pass judgement, on the
accuracy of de Tocqueville’s
maxim, at least insbfar as it applies
to that particular historical period. I
am, however, fairly convinced that
“independence of mind” is rela-
tively rare in our day-—although not
necessarily as a result of majority
tyranny. Within the political context
at least, I am persuaded that our
nationa
result of ignorance.

The burden of an uninformed
electorate has always weighed
heavy on democracies, particularly
those in which universal suffrage
has been the rule. Under pressure
to exercise their political rights,
unlearned and lazy citizens have
little choice but to follow a
charismatic leader, a party line or
an ideological prejudice. They
endorse or condemn, with much

“sheepism” is a direct

emotional fervor, such things as
nuclear power, the Panama Canal
treaties and the coal strike-often
without any good notion of what
they’re talking about.

There are several reasons.behind
the difficulty in ﬁnding a well-in-
formed, independent-minded
American these days._

Expanding technologies and
societies are reﬂected in ever more
complex issues. Political and
economic inter-relationships are
often so far ﬂung and obscure it is
nearly impossible to identify them,
let alone judge them. Even the most
ambitious and intelligent citizen is
liable to be frustrated in an attempt
to keep up with the machinations of
20th century government and
business. A lot of people simply
give up.

Whether or not it is necessitated
by increased social and technologi-
cal complexity, the trend toward
bureaucratic centralization has
contributed to apathy, and there-
fore to ignorance. The local political
institutions that were once funda-
mental to the American sense of
liberty and responsibility are mere
shadows of what they were in de
Tocqueville’s day. Local bureaucra-
cies are larger now, of course, but
relative to the Federal Government
their inﬂuence is narrowing. Most
policies are no longer decided or
administered within reach of the
average citizen’s indignation, so his
interest has tended to wane.

Perhaps the strongest push
toward intellectual superficiality
has come from the least expected
source—our burgeoning afﬂuence.
Although prosperity has given us
access to more and more informa-
tion, it has also given us an excuse
for editing certain kinds of

information out of our lives.

r The hazards of new fortunes have
included an increasing—-—and in
some ways alarming—devotion to
--entertainment. Any number of
people can wax eloquent on the
career of Joe Namath, but how
many know the details of what went
on in Columbia while. Teddy
Roosevelt was President? Without
that knowledge, it would be pretty
difficult to make an informed
decision on the canal treaties.
Closer to home, I would be afraid to

study the ratio of record album to

Television is everjybody’s whip-
ping boy, but in view of the fact that
the beating is eminently justifiable,

I don’t mind contributing a few—

licks. The seemingly evolutionary
inanity of general programming is
bad en0Ugh._bu.t TV news seems
quite determined to follow the Six
Million Dollar Man into the abyss.
Local news programs in Pittsburgh,
for instance, are increasingly
devoted to studio banter, man-on-
the-street interviews and narrow-
minded “consumer reports.”
Television (and radio) are, of

course, also limited in their ability
to function as news media by, time

and by technical constraints. Unlike
newspapers, for instance, they
cannot provide detailed news or
comments; the clock moves too
quickly, and listeners’ attention
spans are too short. Yet despite the
broadcast media’s inability to
provide wide-ranging, in-depth
reporting on substantive issues,
Americans get their news from the
tube more than ever. Newspapers,
on the other hand, are in decline.

The result has been, I think, the
development of an authentically
American ‘ ‘headline mentality. ’ ’
We know, from watching Walter
Cronkite, what the issues are—we
just don’t know very much about
them.

America's “headline mentality”
—if it does, in fact, exist—is bound
to have a profound and disturbing
effect on “govemment by the
people.” Counteracting that effect
is an important and difficult
problem.

Any attempt to somehow limit the
franchise to the well-informed
would cause more problems than it
would solve, and it would smack of
elitism. Imposing minimum stand-
ards on television news would be
vehemently opposed by that
industry (for good reasons as well as
bad), and would probably be
unconstitutional.

Ultimately, if popular govern-
ment is to work very well, we will
have to set aside some of our toys
and concentrate a lot more attention
on the business of responsible
citizenship. It will not be an easy
task in this complicated age, but
surely Americans can at least‘
temper their lust for entertainment
with a little serious reading. Unless
we stem the tide of our ignorance,
we are doomed to wallow in it.

Strange Customs Flourish At Arena Car Show 

 

From Heartbreak Hotel to a galaxy far, far
away, the Custom Car show displayed the
vehicles of American fantasy last weekend at
the Civic Arena. Besides the van tributes to
“Star wars” and Elvis, there were roadsters,
dragsters and a “Mafia Mixer,” TV stars, Big
Bird and a Wookie. The point of the hoopla?
At $4 per person, it seemed obvious.

“The Tony Dorsett Story”
By Phil Musick

. Ridley Enslow Publishers

Since many books have been
written about lesser sports stars, it
was inevitable that someone would
write a biography about Pitt’s
former Heisman Trophy winner and
current Dallas Cowboys star Tony
Dorsett.

“The Tony Dorsett Story” is the
first book about Dors*ett to be
released in the Pittsburgh area.

“The Tony Dorsett Story” was
written by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
sports editor Phil Musick in an
easy-to-read, straightforward style.

The book is a chronicle of Dorsett’s
career from his days at Hopewell
High School, where he earned prep
all-America honors as a senior,
through his college career, to the
day he signed his first professional
contract with the Cowboys.

The book probably contains
nothing the reader doesn't already
know about Dorsett. Musick, who
wrote a successful biography of
Roberto Clemente several years
ago, doesn’t rely on sensationalism.

What he does, and does well, is
take the statistics and pertinent fact
about his subject and arrange them
in an orderly, chronological style.

Included in the book is a chapter
devoted to last year’s Navy game in
which Dorsett broke the all-time
collegiate rushing record. Musick
quotes several of Dorsett’s team-
mates about the game.

Pitt lineman Tom Brzoza, best
remembered for tackling Dorsett in
the end zone after the Panthers’
running back‘ scored on his
record-breaking run at Annapolis
last October, says about the tackle,

“I remember I was screaming at _

him. I don't even know what I was

saying. I don’t even know if they
were words. I was just as happy as
hell.”

This chapter, probably the most
interesting one in the book, also
includes the full sequence of photos
showing Dorsett’s historic run.

The book tells how “homesick"
Dorsett though about quitting
football. * '

“Tony had been at Pitt for about
two weeks," Tony's mother
explains in the book. “He hadn’t
even played a game yet. He called
and said he was going to quit. He
told me he didn’t like it at Pitt. That
football wasn’t fun the way it had
been in high school. That it was
rougher and tougher, more like a
business.”

Myrtle Dorsett goes on to explain
how she then called Jackie Sherrill,
then head coach at Washington
State, and told him about her son's
intentions to quit. Sherrill soon
called Dorsett. Several days later,
Dorsett called his mother back and

said “everything was all right.”

Many black-and-white action
shots are included, among them
some interesting pictures of Dorsett
in action as a skinny-legged, 158
pound high school running back.

“The Tony Dorsett Story” is a
good reference book for those
football fans who want information
about Dorsett, but who don’t want
to dig through back issues of Sports
Illustrated and The Pitt News to get
it —

often ﬁnd hard to accept today. One
cannot help but feel that time may
have dulled the edge of much of the
play’s speciﬁc humor. Also, despite
its clever scenes and exchanges,
much of the play could drag.

However, the Pitt Players proved
tht this is not the case. Their

production was lively, well-paced,
sharp and vivacious. The cast
exuded vitality and enthusiasm at
all times. The play was a total
delight from beginning to end.

Written in 1672 “The Country
Wife” was ﬁrst produced in 1675
and became the first great
Restoration comedy. “The Country
Wife” is lusty, merciless and
free-wheeling. Its tone is heavily
‘£:‘3’:'x‘il"c’él, %’r“n‘6'ial aria anti-‘puntan. it
is a brilliant socio-historical com-
ment on its own age and still retains
impact today in a society hardly less
hypocritical.

The play involves a triple plot.
Plot one concerns Horner, a rakish
libertine, king of the “cuckold-
makers,” has devised a new way to

r... .—-q'-

procure a harem of mistresses for
his insatiable sexual appetite.
Returning to London from a trip
abroad, he pays a doctor to spread
around a lie——that he has become
impotent.

The London husbands no longer
fear Hornet. The pretentious and
“respectable” wives are no longer
afraid to be seen with him.
Ironically, the husbands even seek
out Hornet as a companion and
escort for their wives, since they are
now “safe” with him. The
hypo-critical ladies—prim, proper
and “moral” on the outside—turn
out to be sex-pots within. In the
“china” scene, "Homer makes love
to Lady Fidget while in the next
room her husband, Sir Jasper
Fidget, almost rolls on the ﬂoor with
laughter at “poor” Horner’s
“problem.”

Plot two involves Mr. Pinchwife,
an old companion of Homer in
whoring and carousing. He is well
aware of the dangers London
presents to marital ﬁdelity and the
hypocrisy of the “intelligent” high
society women. His one goal in life
is not to be a cuckold. Thus, he has
moved to the country and found
Margery, a beautiful, young and
naive “country wife.”

He is forced to return to London
for 3 days on business, and he tries
to keep his curious wife on a leash.
Unwittingly, every effort to keep
Margery ignorant only leads her
one step closer to Horner’s
bedroom. The doctor, in disbelief
and amazement, watches from
behind a screen as the husbands
lead their wives to Horner’s
lodgings, and the women literally
wait in line outside his bedroom.

Plot three involves Alithea
(Pinchwife’s sister) and her up-
coming marriage to Master Spark-
ish, a foppish, self-proclaimed
“wit.” She is caught in the middle
of an incredible and hilarious
series of ironic misunderstandings,
confusions and double-meanings,
as she is secretly courted by Master

Harcourt, a friend of Homer.

The production fulﬁlled and often
exceeded all expectations. The
opening-night audience of about
200 responded with enthusiasm and

for long periods the laughter was
uninterrupted.

All aspects of the presentation,
from the simulated-parchment
handbill programs and the .cos-
tumed stagehands to the rococo
period music (by Christine Frezza),
were geared to recreate the
atmosphere of 17th century London.
The simple, yet classically elegant
set was well designed by David
Ferguson. The period costumes
(Heidi Hollmann Pribram) meshed
well with the tone of the production.

The acting was generally top-
notch. The 17th century English
provided few problems for the cast,
which handled it with ease and
polish, except for the maid, Lucy
(Nancy Brickner) who seemed to
have a little difficulty. with some of
her lines. Paul Rosa (Homer),
Daniel Frezza (Sparkish), Lisa
Bansavage (Alithea) and Alice Rosa
(Margery Pinchwife) were most
impressive in their roles. Alice
Rosa especially stood out for her
excellent portrayal. Ronald Wis-
niski’s Mr. Pinchwife, though at
times uneven, was generally
effective.

Bernard McKenna (Harcourt),
Len Kupfer (Sir Jasper Fidget) and
Keith Hoovler (Dorilant) seemed to
miss opportunities to further
characterize and add depth to their
roles. This was not the case with

Gary Grant (the Quack), who added
an incredible amount of subtlety
and depth to a character who had
relatively few lines. Not a single
gesture, step or expression was
wasted, just as with Nardi Novak
(Dainty Fidget) who also had a
smaller part. She and Patricia Stack
(Lady Fidget) and Martha Gronsky
(Mistress Squeamish) worked well
as a trio. Debra Goron (Old Lady
Squeamish) seemed at times
uncomfortable in her part.

Director Kathleen George de-
serves much credit for the success
of the production. The play was
subtly but unmistakeably well-
timed and paced. It was not
overpaced, a “trick” often used in
directing a Restoration or Moliere
comedy, to have the company do the
play in “double time.” The rhythm
was natural and seemed to flow
rather than “run.”

George should especially be
noted for her handling of the last
scene, which could be called a
director’s nightmare.

Aside from the actual mechanics
of stage direction and production,
George seemed to add something
intangible to the work—-an earnest-
ness, vitality and exuberance that
many college companies, cranking

' out musty play after play, seem to

lack. “The Country Wife” is a
delight.

Villanova Calls Off Panthers, 72-70 

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writers

It was only ﬁtting that the two
themes of the Pitt basketball
season, controversy and a case of
“almosts” at the end of the game,
should combine to give the
Panthers their ﬁnal defeat, 72-70,
to Villanova at the Civic Arena
Friday night.

The controversy began with the
benchings of Larry Harris and

Sonny Lewis and then spread to '

encompass the question of coach

   

Tim Grgurich’s winter occupation

for 1978. The “almosts” reached
their zenith after losses to George
Washington, Temple and Cincin-
nati, at which time speculation was
that graduate assistant Jim Bolla
was doing a thesis on the different
ways to lose a basketball game.

In front of the largest crowd to
watch a college basketball game in
Pittsburgh, 13,676, controversy,
the “almosts,” Wayne Williams
and Rory Sparrow all came
together in the ﬁnal seven seconds.
Referee Mickey Crowley, playing

. his role in the melodrama, made

The Call, setting the stage for
Sparrow to make the most
important basket of his college
career.

Much debate will surround The
Call for some time; right after
Crowley let the Arena crowd know
why he had blown his whistle,
there were many people who could
be heard voicing a deﬁnite opinion
as to his parents’ marital status at
the time of his birth. After the
game, no one admitted seeing the
play, and, if they did admit it, the
usual cliches about referees’ calls
not affecting the outcome of a game
were the rule. But three things can
definitely be said about the
situations surrounding The Call:
Although it may not have affected
the outcome of the game, The Call
shortened the game by some ﬁve
minutes; the result of the Pitt-

Villanova game affected the atten-
dance for Saturday night, and,
after making The Call, Crowley
exchanged what could have been
construed as congratulatory hand
signs with the Villanova bench
during the ensuing timeout.

For the first ﬁve minutes of the
game, Sam Clancy was the Panther
offense, which added up to only
four points. Pitt was having trouble
working the ball on offense in
general and Williams was having
trouble in particular. Enter Pete
 ; €t‘:ie’_'_’_e:*_é-. E-xit farther trouble

bringing the ball up the ﬂoor.

’ Villanova began the game with a
deadly touch from the ﬁeld, and,
when the Wildcats cooled as the half
wore on, the team that had ﬁnished
eighth in the league in rebounding
(Pitt ﬁnished ﬁrst) began asserting
itself on the boards. Villanova’s
actual shooting percentage was
below 50 percent, but its ratio of
points to possessions of the ball was
» much higher.
The Panthers found themselves
in danger of being blown away by a
combination of the scoring of

 

Larry Harris

Srakocic photo

Reggie Robinson and Alex Bradley
and the rebounding of Whitey
Rigsby (a 6-4 guard who rebounds
more with intelligence and hustle
rather than leaping ability). Pitt
regrouped to outscore the
Wildcats, 14-6, in the latter stages
of the ﬁrst half to cut the deﬁcit to
three, 37-34.

Although down by less than two
hoops, the Panther situation was
not as rosy as Massimino’s pudgy
cheeks. Pitt was being outrebound
ed at the alarming rate of 2 to 1,
and of the 14 ﬁeld goals the
Panthers registered in the ﬁrst 20
minutes, Harris and Clancy com-
bined for 13 (Strickland had the
other). Pitt was not getting
anything even resembling balanced
scoring.

Terry Knight laid a goose egg in
the scorebook in the ﬁrst half, and
increased his scoring total to one
ﬁeld goal by the game’s end.
Granted, Knight did not play as
many minutes as usual, but for Pitt
to win against the good teams, it
must get more than two points from
a starting guard.

Rigsby was the game’s leading
rebounder with 12, and his 10
points and six assists would qualify
the Wildcat guard as the main
reason (that wore a Villanova
uniform) why the Panthers were
not in Saturday’s ﬁnal.

Clancy, although ﬁnishing fourth
in the rebounding race with eight,
played the type of game that
spurred one local journalist to vote
for Pitt’s prize freshman as the
tourney‘s MVP simply because he
“liked to watch him play.” A man.
and, despite stories that began to
circulate after a few of his
performances, that is all Clancy is,
can accept only so much physical
punishment before the body
succumbs. Being the Panthers sole
strength underneath ﬁnally caught
up with him, but 22 points, eight

Wildcats Claw West Virginia, 63-59

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Villanova Wildcats built a
17-point second-half lead and held
off a furious comeback bid by West
Virginia to defeat the Mountain-
eers, 63-59, in the ﬁnals of the
Eastern Eight tournament Satur-
day night at the Civic Arena.

A crowd of 6,152 (the three-day
total was 30,451) saw the glass
slipper West Virginia had worn
since its opening round upset of

Rutgers turn to plastic when three
Mountaineer turnovers in the ﬁnal
minute handed Villanova the
NCAA tournament bid.

Behind 27 ﬁrst-half points from
its front line (Alex Bradley, Reggie
Robinson and Keith Herron) and 53
percent shooting, Villanova took a
37-29 intermission lead.

Only half of West Virginia’s
two-man show performed in the
first half, as Lowes Moore was left
to carry much of the offensive

burden alone. Maurice Robinson,
the taller half of the act and the
league’s leading rebounder
through the regular season, only
could convert 33 percent of his ﬁeld
goal attempts and was shut out (as
in zero rebounds) in the battle of
the boards.

Villanova’s defense, whether a
zone or man-to-man, continually
forced the Mountaineers to work
the ball for long periods of time

The Pitt men’s swimming team

captured the Eastern championship
for the third straight year over the
weekend with 444 total points at
Trees Pool. The three-day meet saw
Panther Scott Winkler named
outstanding diver, while teammate
Mark Schuman took the outstand-
ing swimming award. In addition,
coach Dick Bradshaw was selected
coach of the meet for the third
consecutive season.

“I am pleased with the team’s
performance,” said Bradshaw.
“This year, I think some of the
swimmers who qualified for
nationals have a good chance to
place.” ‘

Pitt took the lead early, winning
three out of ﬁve events the ﬁrst day.
They kept up the momentum and
went on to win more than half of the
events. During the course of the
meet, atotal of 15 pool records were
set, 13 Eastern records fell and 14
swimmers qualiﬁed for the NCAA
championships.

49.37 and the 100-yard freestyle in
45.76. All three were both pool and
Eastern records, and the butterﬂy
performance entitled him to NCAA
competition.

The Pitt freshmen did their part
toward the Panther victory. Jeff

Trew won the 500-yard freestyle in
4:31.96 and the 1650-yard freestyle
in 15:46.87. He also placed third in
the 200-yard freestyle.

Scott Winkler, a sophomore

diver, placed third in the one-meter
diving, but it was his excellent

springboard that won him the event
and the outstanding diver distinc-
tion. Pat Greenwell also performed
well on the three-meter board,

large margin. 7

Other notable swimmers were}

who won the 200-yard butterﬂy, 3 

event in which WVU took all three
top spots. His time was a record and
qualiﬁed him for the NCAA’s.
Maryland’s Greg Blasic won the
50-yard freestyle in 21.28, a tenth of
a second ahead of Bill Thorne of
East Carolina. Steve Shinholser
captured top honors in the
one-meter diving with an excellent
performance. Bruce Ziegler, from
Syracuse took the 100-yard breast-
roke in record time and qualiﬁed for
nationals.

Maryland took second in overall
competition with 319 points, ‘ _
Virginia took third with 282 and

of the year take the form of a 17-foot swish by
Villanova’s Rory Sparrow. Sparrow’s Panther
killing with but a second left in Friday’s Eastern
Eight semifinal game at the Civic Arena was the sixth
and final slap to Pitt’s 1977-78 basketball face.

“Out of our 11 losses,” Grgurich said of his 16-11
squad, “I’d have to say six came that way... "As far
as the charging call goes, it’s part of the game. One
call doesn’t make or break a game.”

That already infamous call, issued a scant six ticks
of the clock before Sparrow’s winning field goal,
came at a time when Pitt was setting up for the final
shot (designed to go to Mr. Everything, Larry Harris,
Grgurich said). The Panthers had successfully
drained more than an anxious Villanova minute off
the clock before referee Mickey Crowley made one of
the bravest calls since the pot called the kettle black.

A judgement infraction against Wayne Williams
for charging (or a moving screen or whatever
Crowley interpreted it as) sent 13,676 partisans (a
Pittsburgh basketball record) to the farthest edges of
their seats.

But the crowd’s hope for a flubbed Wildcat at-
tempt at the game winner was in vain; the turnover
situation was a deja vu six times over for the Pan-
thers, who took one last dejected walk to the dressing

(Continued from . Page 12)

“It’s a tough way to lose the last game of the
season,” said Pete Strickland, the Pitt guard who
was working a weave with Williams at the time of the
offensive violation. “But that’s something every
major college team has to think about—every season
is going to end with a loss unless you win the national
championship.”

  

 

Villanova coach Rollie Massimino, who went on to
win the tournament with a Saturday win over West
Virginia, was “of course elated” that his Wildcats
were able to win “one of those trade-me games,” in
which the lead was never greater than four points for
either team in the second half. Massimino undouted-
edly was elated with that final foul call, too, which,
even though Grgurich contends didn’t break the Pan-
thers, did brake Pitt’s hopes.

“I thought the officiating was outstanding,”
Massimino said.

Crowley looked as if he enjoyed himself, as well.
Standing along the sideline after the foul call,
Crowley pointed what seemed to be a go-get—’em

“We ended the season the way

rebounds and two blocked shots is
nothing to hang one’s head about.
Villanova, and the rest of the
Eastern Eight, will all have to
answer to Clancy before his career
is over.

Williams, who didn’t even take a
shot in the first half, caught ﬁre in
the second 20 minutes to add 10
points to the Panther cause,
demonstrating an ability to take
any number of Wildcat defenders
to the hoop. Williams, possibly the

ost inspirational player on the
siguad, will have to undergo
surgery to repair damages to his
left knee.

for a cracked bone in his knee,’
Grgurich said. “That guy is what
it’s all about; he’s been injured
since the first basketball game and
never made a single excuse.”
Strickland was as poised on the
court as he was at the microphone
following the game. Inserted into
the game to give the Pitt offense

did just that with a long jumper.
The junior guard ﬁnished with four
points, but considering his 13
assists, Strickland had a hand in
almost half the Panther points.
The lone criticism of Harris’s
style of play was that the 6-7 senior
didn’t play with intensity. Harris
threw a monkey wrench into that
theory with two outstanding
performances in the tournament.
His points (25 and 26) came either
over the defense or through it with
a steady frequency. Harris was
involved in what proved to be his
ﬁnal non-paying performance to
such a degree that on several
nccasioris he appeared to be on the
‘verge of a technical foul. A ﬁtting
way for the game to end would
have been for Harris to do
something that has become his
trademark, hitting a jumper With a
hand in his face to end the
ballgame. Harris’s basketball
career is not over however, it will
simply become more lucrative.

To the victors (Whiter Riasbv) 90 the spa!

we started it," Grgurich said. “We
experienced a lot of tough losses,
but we’re a team now; we’re a
program again. The kids deserve it
because they’re the ones who
turned it around after a very
negative year last year.”

‘‘It was one of the ﬁner games in
the city this year,” Grgurich
added.

PANTHER NOTES: Massimino V

and Sparrow disagreed about what
The Call actually was...“It was
deﬁnitely a charge,” Massimino
said. “The officiating was out-
standing, and it was called.”...

Sparrow believed it was more a

moving screen violation. “It wasn’t
a charge,” Sparrow said. “At
home, we would have gotten the
call, and since the ofﬁciating was
so great, they made the call.”...
Pitt’s 16 wins were the most since
1974-75...Harris finished with
1,914 points...Grgurich’s record as
a head coach is 34-47.

Panthers’ Final Breath a Fitting End to a Frustrating Year ‘

clench of the fist toward the Wildcat bench. The
gesture, whatever it was meant to be, was stupid at
best—a controversial move that only added insult to
Panther injury. Keeping in mind five similar heart-
breakers, it was a fitting end to a frustrating basket-
ball season.

And it was the end; even NIT to the Panthers
means Not In Tournament. But the Eastern Eight
playoffs, if nothing else, proved two things: One,
that Tim Grgurich is a basketball coach and not just
a recruiter, and two, that basketball is not dead in
Pittsburgh. The latter was proved by the appearance
of a major league crowd Friday night and the former
is apparent by the way Grgurich turned around one
of the most anemic basketball programs in the coun-
try. Put them both together and you get (unlike at
the end of last season) an urge to yell, “Wait’ll next
yearf’

A sidenote: Even more dangerous to one’s health
(considering the size of the crowd) than Crowley’s
foul call was an Arena usher’s attempt to keep Pitt
cheerleader extraordinaire, Tiger Paul Auslander,
off the court during a timeout. After a boisterous
suggestion from those in attendance, a police officer
finally gave the usher permission to let Tiger do his
thing.

Sidenote to a sidenote: Mossie Murphy,
Duquesne’s attempt at Tiger Paul, might do well by
taking cheering lessons from his Pitt counterpart as
the University might do well by sending Tiger to this

year’s annual cheerleading competition in California

before getting it into shooting
range. And, unfortunately for West
Virginia, the man getting the open
shots was Joe Fryz, who was colder
than a Civic Arena hotdog
throughout the game (three for 11).

Mo Robinson suddenly came
alive in the game’s final 11 minutes,
scoring 10 points to lead a West
Virginia surge that saw the
Mountaineers outscore Villanova,
21-8. Sid Bostick added seven

 

points during the span that had the
Mountaineers crash the offensive
boards to score no fewer than 10
points on second or third shots.

Although he cooled somewhat in
the second half, Bradley was still
Rollie Massimino’s main man, and
his two free throws with less than
one minute to play put the
handwriting on the wall.

“Not too many people gave us a
truly legitimate chance to win this
thing,” said Massimino. “Last

year, we went to the NIT and this
year it’s the NCAA, and that’s
what it’s all about. That's what we
have been working for.”

EASTERN EIGHT BALLS: The
attendance at this year’s tourna-
ment was nearly four times last
year’s ﬁgure... Moore was the
tourney’s leading scorer with 61
points, followed by Bradley with 54
and Larry Harris with 5l...Du-
quesne’s Jesse Hubbard was the
leading rebounder.

Stetler Sets Five Individual Records

By KAREN KADILAK»
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt all-America swimmer Kathy
Stetler smashed both meet and
team records in ﬁve individual
events to pace the Pitt Pantherettes
to a fourth-place ﬁnish in the
women’s Eastern Regional Cham-
pionships at Penn State this
weekend.

While Rutgers waltzed away with
the team title on the wings of a 623
point team total, Stetler stole the
individual spotlight in the three-day
meet. The junior from Oakmont
broke records in all ﬁve of her
events—-S0-, 100- and 200-yard
freestyle and 50- and 100-yard

butterﬂy. She also anchored the

200-yard freestyle relay team as it
also set meet and team records.

It marked the first time in the
championship’s history that any
individual set records in six
separate events. For her perfor-
mance, Stetler earned most
valuable swimmer honors in the
meet and was accorded a standing
ovation at the award ceremonies
yesterday.

“She (Stetler) had a super
meet,” Pantherette coach Kate
Matheson said. “Just a super
meet. We had a lot of good swims.
A lot of people had their best times,
and Kathy was one of them.”

In ﬁnishing fourth, Pitt scored
253 points. Princeton took second

place honors behind Rutgers while
Penn State (255 points) edged out
Pitt for third place. Syracuse
ﬁnished ﬁfth.

Besides Stetler, Suzanne Pulley,
a freshman from Richmond, Va. set
team records in both the 100-yard
breast stroke and 100-yard indivi-
dual medley.

Pitt will now prepare for the
national championships, which will
be held at Duke University in
Durham, N.C. next week. Stetler
(50-, 100- and 200-yard freestyle
and 50- and 100-yard butterﬂy),
Pulley (100-yard breast stroke and
100-yard individual medley), and
the 200-, 400- and 800-yard
freestyle relay teams have qualiﬁed
for the nationals. V I
