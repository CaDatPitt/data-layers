‘News’ Poll Indicates War Disapproval

Student Government Inconsistencies Mark Voting

As Leaders Show Views

Elects Rosenstein As
Review Board Member

by PAUL STOLLER
Student Government (SG) has approved (elected) a
third member to the University Review Board. The new-
ly elected member is Jay Rosenstein, sports editor of the
Pitt News, a member of Pi Delta Epsilon (National Jour-
alistic honorary), and a brother in the Zeta Beta Tau fra-

ternity.

With the election of Rosenstein, the Board Willl begin
to function. The board will serve in two capacities.

%> It will be the ﬁnal arbitrator in any Student Govern-
ment const:itutional dispute. In this sense, it will serve as a judicial

arm to Student Government.

I> The board will also provide a student element in University
policy. The members of the Review Board will sit in on University
policy discussions with members of the faculty and administration.
“My ﬁrst duty,” stated Rosenstein, ‘‘will be to help originate and
organize the structural set-up of the Review Board. After a brief

period of organizational work
the Review Board should begin
functioning.”

The Senate also discussed and
transacted the following items
Tuesday night:

>T‘he revised SG By-Laws
presented to the Senate by Sen-
ators Sue Bloom, Dick Camp-
bell, Joan Saltzman, and Frank
Tutino. Each revision was dis-
cussed by the Senate. The vote
concerning the by-laws will be
held at the next meeting.

>Angel Flight, the women’s
auxiliary to the Arnold Air So-
ciety was granted continued rec-
ognition by the Senate.

>Alpha Phi Omega was al-
located the sum of $500 for the
construction of its Homecom-
ing ﬂoat. The allocation was
passed after a long debate.

In an effort to survey the
leaders on the University cam-
pus, The Pitt News sent out 38
questionnaires to the people
who have executive positions in
all-campus or large special.in-
terest groups. The purpose of
the Poll was to try to ascertain
how much anti-war activity
might be expected on the cam-
pus this year, since the opinions
of the campus leaders should be
an extremely important factor.

The people surveyed were Stu-
dent Government (SG) sena-
tors, officers of IFC and Pan-
Hel, AWS, chairmen of the Lib-
eral Arts and Engineering Cab-

‘Revolutionary Politics’
Focus For New Course

The International Studies Pro-
gram (ISP) has -announced a
special interdisciplinary pro
gram on “Revolutionary Poli-
tical Movements” for juniors
and seniors in the winter term.
According to the ISP office.
“The course is like the program
in Latin American Studies con-
ducted last spring. It is intend-
ed to give well-qualiﬁed under-
graduates an opportunity to
study a vital topic intensively,
and to do this from the pers-
pectives of several disciplines.”

Faculty for the course will be
Professors Robert Colodny, his-

tory; Burkart Holzner, sociol-
ogy; James Malloy, political
science; and Richard Tobias,

English. Says Dr. Robert Avery,
associate director of ISP, “This
kind of education is important

for students in their junior and
senior years. The students will
have an opportunity to worl:
closely with the faculty.”

The ISP office has stated that
“the course is not limited to
students who are majoring in
one of the four ﬁelds represent-
ed by the faculty, but back-
ground in at least one of the
fields is presumed.

“Admission is by formal ap-
plication and enrollment will be
limited. The course will carry
nine credits toward the B.A. de-
gree. Some of these credits mav
be used to meet departmental
honors requirements (though
admission is not restricted to
honors students), and some may
be used to ﬁll distribution of
studies requirements in human-

inets, senior members of the
Pitt News Editorial Board, S-G
officers, and the officers of
Men’s Dorm Council.

Many of the results (printed
below) speak for themselves —
the leadership on this campus is
not for the war, but not too
sure how against it they are.
The most striking aspect of
their replies was the seeming
inconsistency of their replies.

For example, one SG -senator
checked “no” to all three items
in question III, thereby seeing
no advantage at all for the US
to continue the war. Yet, the
senator checked to the
question asking him if he con-
demned war.

“no?!

There are ‘two interpretations
of this phenomenon. The ﬁrst
is simply that the people polled
do not have an adequate know-
ledge of the war—a good as-
sumption, judging by the pre-
valance of replies of this na-
ture. Another interpretlatio-n,
however, «could be just as valid
—the simple fact that the is-
sues of the war are so clouded
as to preclude more consistent
answers, even by people who
have some knowledge of the
issues

Because of this, a person who
can see no good at all to the
United States being in Vietnam
can still not condemn the war-
certainly a sad sign, but not at
all an isolated incident. Almost
every reply included seeming

Pin a Monicker on the Little Cub

“Name The Panthe” ontest Begins

For the ﬁrst time since the
glory days of Panther football,
the team has a real, live mascot.
Alas, the mascot as yet has no
name. To rectify this intoler-
able situation, the Athletic De-
partment and the Pitt News are
sponsoring a contest to name
him.

The object of all this atten-
tion is a 12 week old male pan-
ther cub who hails front North
Dakota. Although small enough
now that he can be kept on a
leash at home games,'he will
soon grow to full size. Then, he
will be kept in a glass cage at
the Stadium.

The new panther is the direct
result of a statement made by
Dave Hart when he took over
the reins here. Although he ex-
pressed admiration for the work

 

done by the University’s stu-
dent Panther, Hart said that the
school should also have a live
mascot.

The Beaver County Pitt Club
took him at his word and the
now nameless “real thing” is
the result of their efforts.

The contest is open to all Uni-
versity students. Entries will he
received from now until the
week of Homecoming. The win-
ner will be announced at half-
time of the Homecoming game.

The Name the Panther Com-
mittee consists of Dean Billick,
sports information director; Jav
Rosenstein, sports editor of the
Pitt News; Paula Radvak, cap-
tain of the cheerleaders, and
Cathy Walker of the Homecom-
ing Committee.

Saturday Night Entertainment?

Men Watch Chiller Theater

by DAN LICHENSTEIN

The men’s social life
thnives long into the night

past the women’s curfews.
Spirited bull sessions often
last until dawn. Card games
probably produce more all-
nighters than ﬁnals week. An
important staple of late Satur-
day night entertainment is Chill-
er,Theater.

Chiller Theater is WIIC-TV’s
offering of two, third-rate mons-
ter movies.

By 1:30 a.m., -most men have
left their dates and have drift-
ed back to a fraternity house or
apartment. There, on any given
Saturday night, they -are bound
to ﬁnd a group of friends gath-
ered about a TV laughing at
vampires, mummies or other as-
sorted, creeps. Laughing at these
creatures is ‘the key to the enter-
tainment of these horrible old
movies. -

No one would ever think of
tuning in such drivel as Terror
from the Year 5000 alone. But
with a group of fraternity broth-
ers or roommates, Chiller The
ater can become more fun than
comedy hour on television. The
more ridiculous and unbeliev-
able the movie gets, the funnier
it becomes.

The movie itself provides only
a part of the amusement. Most
of .the humor is supplied by the
audience. As -late as 1:45 .a.m.,
there may still be a couple left
over from a fraternity party
huddling at the far corner of a
living room couch. But they are
ignored, for most humor con-
cerning a typical “horror ﬂick”

monster’s sex life, or lack of .

one. Of course, the entire cast
is subject to this type of re-
..mark.

Most viewers play the old

“American standard TV commer

cial game: dashing to the kitch-
en for a sandwich o-r Pepsi and

_ back without missing any pre-

cious seconds of the feature
show. In apartments, this game
can be expanded to include a
shower for the duration of two,
one minute -commercials. It can

WIIC does not limit itself to
Saturday night fare. The sta-
tions oflfers a few horror movies
in the weekday afternoons as
well. These matinees are prob-
ably not as popular, but they

“do provide a good way to kill

time between a last class and
dinner.
After several years of Chiller

Theater, WIIC is getting a lit-
tle desperate for titles. Long
gone are the old classics such
as Rodian and I Was a Teen-
Age Werewolf. A list of mons-
ier movies from a few years
ago revealed titles of He, She,
It, They, and Them. WIIC has
probably seen them all.

You know, the people who build the cars

mixed with the standard, third-
rate domestic fare. But a few
are timely, such as Monster

as The Swamp of the Lost Mons-
ters. And who could resist Mons-

Another question explored by SG involved the Student Union. The

Both issues cited require intensive investigation in order to be

Questions

Although only one month of our Fall Term has elapsed, key is-
sues of student concern have already developed. As Student Government
(SG) has taken the initiative on most of these issues, the machinery has
been set in motion to achieve solutions to problems raised.

The most recent topic of student concern to be explored is the
out-of-state student fee. The Senate bill passed this week called for tui-
tion reduction from $1,400 to $1,050 is a step in the right direction. How-
ever, it doe.~sn’t begin to solve the other problems involved gin attracting
out-of-state students, such as the lack of dormitory space. As our new
dorms will not be completed for several years, we must inaugurate a
massive University «off-campus housing program to remedy the lack of

 

 

To Examine

followed up by exploration of all aspects of the speciﬁc area of concern.
A bill to lower tuition deals with only one aspect of the problem of the
declining numbers of out-of-state students attending our University.

SG must explore every phase of the out-of-state student problem,
as this question directly affects the composition of our student body.
Fortunately, we have a ﬁne Director of Admissions in Bernard Kobosky.
SG representatives should work with him and the Admissions Office
in exploring the area of out-of-state student enrollment as there is ob-
viously a common concern about this problem.

The other issue cited, the Student Union, also has not been fully
explored. We urge the SG executive branch to carry out the dictum in

the Senate bill and work towards a resolution of the students’ grievances

as expressed by the Senate.
In raising issues such as those cited above, SG is fulﬁlling its role
in representing the student body. However, questioning is only the ﬁrst
step. Solutions must now be found for the problems raised by SG. SG
must show its determination to see these issues through. For only then
will the students really be represented.

Letters To The Editor

Reader Answers
Edwards’ Letter

Editor, The Pitt News:

In answer to Gabbie Edwards’
accusation-s, I will ask the fol-'
lowing questions:

1. Has Miss Edwards ever at-
tended a class in the French
room while the jukebox is blar-
ing? If she -has, she can hear
it quite distinctly, while the
ﬂoor under her feet is vibrating‘.
Some students, although maybe
not Miss Edwards, like to have
a decent classroom atmosphere.

2. Does Miss Ediwards know
the function of Student Union,
especially the now-defunct Cub’s
Den. Its primary function “is to
allow students to let off steam
and not to study. If one want-
ed to -study, all he would have
to do is stop all the card games
and yelling which goes on from
9 to 4 o’clock.

3. Has Miss Eidwards ever
stood in the speed lane, where
only the bass part can be heard?
If she h.as, she now hasan Ex-
cedrin Headache.

4. How many people did she
ask about the box? Did she ask
the Slaga ernployees, the jani-
to-rs, or maybe the elevator op-

erators? If she asks these peo-
ple, she might ﬁnd that it is
not only unnerving but can be
heard in the halls. But this only
to more mature, elderly people
than herself.

5. Did “Gabbie” read out let-
ter? Maybe she did. All we did
was deplore the bad conditions
and noted that students now
rendered present study facilities
impotent.

In summary, as we stated ll‘.
our last letter, the University
now needs more study areas,
not less. Miss Edwards’ “lovely”
jukebox is now eliminating one

_area. sorely used and needed by

commuters and is making the
“students squeeze” pinch more
than ever.

GrittlesonReview

Of Concert Hit

Editor, The Pitt News:

I disagree with Mr. Gittle-
son’s review of the Rooftop
Singers, concerning their per-
formance here recently.

It was not the Rooftop Sing-
ers who “faltered,” as he put it,
but rather, the audience, the
Student Union Committee that
did the planning, and the mas-
ter of ceremonies.

The audience, in part (the
part that got up and walked
out), was disgustingly rude and
inconsiderate, to say the least.
If these people wanted to leave,
they could have done it proper-
ly—instead, they left talking
and laughing and -disturbing the
remainder of the audience and
the performers.

Here is where the Student
Union comes in. The program
should have had an intermis-
sion to alleviate partially the
outﬂow of students going to
other affairs. An intermission
also would have cooled off an
already restless -audience.

The master of ceremonies
must be given some credit also.
His virtuoso performance, which
included talking to himself for
no less than ﬁve minutes under
the so spo-tlight on stage, did not

‘exactly captivate the audience.

How can the University ex.-
pect socalled “big-name” enter-
tainment to perform here if this
is what we have to offer them?

Co-op Possibility
Editor, The Pitt News:

In an effort to ease the criti-
cism on the policy of the Book
Center, the Center has announc-
ed the reduction of prices for
hardlbacks by ten per cent. This
is no solution to the great prob-
lem created by the high Cost of
books. It may even enhance the
problem by causing professors
to be less hesitant about o-rde-r-
ing hardbacks for their courses.
Perhaps the bookstore was not
altogether unconscious of this
possibility.

I-Iardbacks are not the only
problem. The majority of books
for most courses are paper-
backs. Conspicuously, prices on
these books have not been low-
ered, and some of them are be-
coming nearly as expensive as
the hardbacks.

Many other problems exist in
relation to bookstore policy. The
two week deadline on the re-
turn of unused books is one. A
student dropping a course -after
two weeks is stuck with the un-
used, unreturnable texts.

Another source of irritation
is the policy on used books. The
bookstore buys them -at half
price and marks them up, thus
increasing their proﬁt -on‘t‘he
books they have already sold
once before.

There is a solution. It is far
reaching and even drastic in

scope, but with the present con-
cern and with proper organiza-
tion, it can be accomplished.
The retailer must be eliminated.
The establishment of a student
cooperativ-e is the means by
which this can be accomplished.

This idea is not original. It
has worked well at many other
colleges. Its most notable suc-
cesses are at Yale and Harvard,
where students ruin the co-ops,
and divide the proﬁts.

At the University of Pitts-
burgh, a co-op, run by the stu-
dents, would reduce book prices
to wholesale levels. Used books
could be traded more easily at
a co-op, and students would ﬁnd
a. central co-op more convenient
than hunting through lists of
books for sale posted on a bulle-
tin. Sweatshirts, decals, and
other items bearing the Pitt in-
signia co-uld be carried by a
co-op, and this would -eliminate
the conﬂiict of «interest issue con-
cerning the Book Center and its
director.

A book cooperative could be
located in the Student Union it-
self. It could be ﬁnanced with
caplital obtained from the stu-
dent ‘body. This would be simi-
lar to the methods used by Yale
and Harvard.

This proposal needs suprport.
Right now it is in the talking
stage. The Pitt News can serve
an excellent purpose in arous-
ing the interest of the student
body.

BOB LONG O
Offensive Captain

Soccer Team Visits Ohio U.;
Rockets Shutout Fresh, 1 - O

by ROY JACOBS

As the ‘soccer season moves
into its fo-urth week, the varsity
booters have yet to score, and
that might be enough to un-
nerve anyone, including head
coach Lee Bemis. But the out-
look is somewhat brighter as
the boot-ers travel to Athens,

Ohio, for tomorrow’s meeting .-

with Ohio University.

“We’re going to have to win
1-0 if we’re going to win,” said
the head coach. “The two teams
should be aborut even, although
they have more experience than
we do.”

However, the booters’ scoring
ineptness -so far this season has
resulted largely because of the
team's inexperience. Bob Racu
-nas, last year’s leading scorer,
was counted on for a big year
this season, but Rlacunas is out
for the season with a head in-
jury.

In addition, two of last sea-
son’s freshman stars haven’t
realized their scoring potential.
Bob Quinlan had to be moved
back to halfback because he was
of more use there, although he
now has fewer scoring oppor-
tunities. The other is also a bit
jittery. I

“Bob Trexler is our sopho-
more center forward,” explained
Bemis, “and he’s playing like he
did in high school. I-Ie’s a good
player, but -he never Was a high
scorer. We're wo-rkiin-g on it _with
him.

“Playing offense is tough,” he
continued. “You not only have
to beat the other guy, but you
have to have the skill to -put the
ball through the net afterwards.

“When the pressure’s on, we
look hard to ﬁnd a goal.”

The pressure is on the boot-
ers. Last year they beat Ohio
U., 5-1. At -this point, Bemis
would probably settle for a 1-0
victory.

THE l{AWK’S RUFFLED

What was Jay “Flatbush” Ros-
enstein doing carrying around a
cup ‘of salt all week? And why

.'-as «George “Moustachio” Lies
walking around with -his mo-uth
open? Why, -they were after the
‘'Hawk,’’ of course.

Mike “Hawk” Brourman still
leads the Yogi contest, but his
two biggest competitors are tak-
ing drastic action. “I'm going
to salt down his tail feathers,”
boasted “Flatbush,” while the
“Moustache” hopes to stop him
with salty language. But the
‘‘Hawk’‘ isn't worried. “I am
unstoppable" he cries from his
lofty perch,

 

ROUGH ACTION typliﬁes freshman soccer team’s rivalry with
Slippery Rock frosh. Last Tuesday, the Rockets dealt the little boot-
ers their second loss, 1-0.

_ by CHARLES DWORAK
A third-period goal by Mike Adams led Slippery Rock
to a 1-0 win over the freshman soccer. team Tuesday at Ken-

nard Field. Adams kicked his goal from =three yards out around
goalie Al Everett with 7:25 gone in the period for the gam;e’s only

score.

Frosh coach Jim Snyder ‘con-
sidered the inaccurate shooting
of the frosh a main factor in
their defeat. “We kept the ball
on their side of the ﬁeld most
of the second quarter,” he said,
“but we ‘missed two easy shots
at the goal.”

During the game the Pitt frosh
missed eight shots, and the Slip-

pery Rock goalie had eight saves. -

“We got the long kick working
against them,” Snyder comment-
ed, “but we couldn't do any-
thing close to the goal.”

Snyder complimented the work
of his goalies, who had ten
saves in the game. “Al Evereﬁ:
blocked the shots, but he left
the goal unguarded in‘ the third
period when he called for the
ball, and that was how they
scored,” he said. After Slippery
Rock scored, Snyder took Eve!‘-
ett out and put in Dick Paster-
nak, whom he also credited with

doing a ﬁne job.

“The W-formation blocked
their long kic ,” Snyder ana-
lyzed, and it was also -good
enough to stop them in the mid-
dle of the ﬁeld. But the team-
work still left something to be
desired. The boys couldn't get
together on the plays, and We
h-ad many balls stolen from 

“Slippery Rock. also defeated
us in manpower," Snyder con-
tinued. “They -have 27 men 011

their team, and theirvplatopning

on offense wore out -our half
backs.” ‘

The fro-sh will play Slippery
R.ock again on the road Oct. 18.
Snyder said that he would use
less substitution in that game.
He also mentioned he would
switch to the 4-3-3 defense in
this game, possibly during the
second quarter. “We switched
to the zone defense in the last
quarter Tuesday and held them,”
he -said. “We will again start
with the ,W-formation and will
switch to the 4-3-3. defense if
they score.”

WVU Sets
Sights On
‘Big Game’

by MIKE BROURMAN

West Virginia is a land
of green mountains, hollow-
ed out by dingy coal mines;
of blue -sky covered by a smoky
black :haze. Very little light falls.
Bot, tomorrow no one will no
tlce the atmosphere. Tomorrow

West Virginia meets Pitt.
This game is the season for
the Mountaineers, and all the

rest is merely
WUV window dress-
FOCUS

ing. Thus, when
the two teams
meet, records
can be thrown
away; they won’t mean a thing.

But, West Virginia has some
football players who would be
dangerous even without the rab-
id support of ‘the Mountaineer
fans. Chief among these is sen-
ior tailback Garrett Ford.

Last year Ford had 153 yards
rushing against the Panthers,
including a 56 yard TD burst.
This year, bothered by a sprain-
ed ankle, Ford has carried few-
er times than in either of his
previous seasons. _

Still, Ford has had two tre-
mendous games algainst the
Panthers. And, Ford's bread and
butter play is the pitchout; the
same play that Illinois used to
rip the gridders last week.

When the Mountaineer quar-
terbacks decide to pass, they
have a huge targert in split end
Oscar Patrick. The 6’6” sopho-
more has grabbed off six pas.ses,
including a 55 yard TD play
against Villanova.

Two Mountaineers who rely
on their feet are the other chief
offensive threats, John Mallory.
a slippery runner, is leading the
nation in punt returns. And soc-
cer-style kicker Ken Juskowich
has already booted six ﬁeld
goals.

Quickness and aggressiveness
highlight the West Virginia de-
fense. “They seem to contain
well on wide plays,” observes
Dave Hart. Most aggressive of
the group is linebacker Ron
Yuss. -

Wide plays should provide the
key then. If the Panthers can
stop Ford on the pitch-out, they
will blunt the Mountaineers
most effective offensive weap-
on. Dikewise, Hart believes he
has found a weakness in the
WVU defense. By concentrating

Hart Seeks
First Win
In Hills

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Sports Editor

No one can tell Dave Hart ,_

that tomorroW’s 1:30 p.m.

game with West Virginia at

Mountaineer -Field is the big one
After facing UCLA and Illinois,
each game is a big one, if the
Panthers have a chance win.
Each of the Jungle Cats two
losses have affected Dave Hart
in -different ways. After losing
by 32 points to the Bruins, Hart
was smiling; glad «his sopho-
mores had one game experience
behind them. After last week’s
Illinois debacle, Ha-rt was sick
to his stomach, especially after

seeing his offense fail to score “

four times Within the Illini 30-
yard line. ‘

To boost the sputtering of-
fense, Hart made two changes,
putting defensive back George
Pribish at tailback and moving
George Medich from split, end
to tight end. Pribish, Hart wish-
es, may be that running back
the Panthers need so badly.‘

“I’m looking for someone to
run the football.» Right now 'I
know Mike Raklewicz is the
only runner we have,” said Hart.
who was in a similar situation
last season. '

‘‘That’s why I made the moves.
Right now I'm -grasping and
groping, and it’s -not the easiest
siltuat-io~n,” Hart said.

The loss of three rulnznin-g
backs hasn't helped Hart. He
needs a breakaway back, but he
could be hard pressed to ﬁnd
one on the varsity.
don’t know why we're looking
for 80-yard runs, we should be

looking for 20 yard plays,” point- -, '

ed oust CE-Ilart. A O
In two games, the longest run
from scrimmage is 16 yards by
Raklewicz last week.
In past years, when the Pan-

thers won, people complained‘ ’

the offense wasn’-t exciting. Now
Hart wants to comply. He’.s try-
ing to open u-p, but he is also
experimenting. And in his impa-
tience to win, he must shift
_ players every week, looking for
the right combination.

on sweeps, they" leave them-

selves open in other areas, and‘
“we can take advantage of that ‘A

style -and we can beat them,”
Hart --concludes.
