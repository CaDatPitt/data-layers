Their attitude changed, how-
ever, when Sam Shapiro’s request
for an absentee ballot for last
:night’s presidential election was
brought to the ﬂoor by Advisor
Lester Brailey.

President Howard Greenberger
cited the decision handed down
last year banning absentee voting,

Plans: F or Union Hazy

._The building of a student
union at Pitt will be a “ﬁght
the whole way,” according to
Dean of Men Theodore H.
Biddle. _

The two obstacles facing the
proponents of the student union
are ﬁrst, securing National Pro-
duction Authority sanction, and,
then, securing building materials.

a Dean Biddle has just returned
from a conference sponsored by
the Association of College Unions
in Lansing, Michigan.

There it was reported that “ap-
proval can possibly be obtained
from the N.P.A. for a student
union provided the building can

be proved to serve an educational
rather than a recreational pur-
pose,” said the Dean.
Approval Necessary

N.P.A. approval is necessary for

all construction work.

Dean Biddle believes “we
should design a building which
we hope will receive N.P.A. ap-
proval and proceed on that basis.”

Materials which have become
“increasingly difficult to obtain”
will also be more diiﬁcult to ob-
tain for a building which might
be questionable to the N.P.A.,
such as a student union, than for
one which is clearly eligible, said
Dean Biddle.  .

In yesterday’s mail th e

All four contained votes for

joker or were really stolen:

Warn iAtt’y-General’s  

Power Could be Abused

By DICK KOVAR
Pitt News Editor _
HARRISBURG, May 1 (Special to The Pitt News) —Edu-

cators won a clear—cut victory

today as state legislators and

administrators joined with them in calling for outright defeat
or drastic amendment of the controversial “Loyalty oath” bill.
Following testimony on Senate Bill 27 by Pitt Chancellor

Rufus H. Fitzgerald, Penn Presi-G’ ‘

dent Harold Stassen, Penn Statef
President Milton S. Eisenhower,i
and Temple Provost Millard Glad- ;
felder Monday, Democratic lead-E
ers from both State houses calledfi
for ‘outright defeat’ of the bill,i
while others, including Attorney-
General Robert Woodside and?
House Legislative Committee
Chairman Ivan Watkins, asked for
drastic revision of the already,
amended measure.
Pechan Backs Down

Even the bill’s sponsor, Senator
Albert Pechan, reported that the
State Justice Department was
preparing several amendments,
evidently with his approval, and
stated, “We’d like to get the bill
in such shape that it will not be
oﬂfensive to any patriotic Ameri-
cans. But we don’.t want to weak-
en it any way.”

The about-face left only the
American Legion and the Veter-
ans of Foreign Wars as support-
ers of the measure. ‘

Strong Opposition Felt

Since its passage by the Senate
March‘ 28, the bill has come un-
der heavy ﬁre from all over the
state as teachers and students
from most of Pennsylvania's in-
stitutions of higher learning joined
in opposing the bill and demand-
ing public hearings on it. This
opposition was answered last
week by an invitation to the four
university heads to discuss their
objections with the legislators on
Monday.

KQV Airs Oath

A panel of four students
with William S. Tacey, pro-
fessor of speech, as moderator
will discuss the loyalty oath
bill tomorrow night at 9 p.m.
over KQV. The students are
Bob Gardner, Ernest Huddle,
Edward Burtell and Dick
Kovar.

Top Scholars Lauded at 1:30

Over 410 Pitt students will be tapped by ﬁfteen honorary*

Woman’s Seat
On Congress

: Deadlocked

Ann Curran and Dolores Schaub i

are all'tied up in their battle for

‘a much—disputed senior Student W

Congress seat.

After another recounting of the 

Congress ballots by a committee
of the whole chaired by Bill Mc-
Kinley, the: two women have
emerged with 933 votes apiece.

This ruling about—faces a pre-

vious ruling that Miss Curran had
won by one vote over Miss
Schaub, 924 to 923. .

The tie resulted when the re-
count committee declared invalid
a ballot which carried a vote for
Miss Curran. ’

McKinley explained the ten-

count difference in the tabulations A

by saying that the previous com-
mittee missed the ballots. but it
was ten on each side and they
cancelled each other out.

“Fair, Accurate”—McKinley

In his report to Congress,“Mc-
Kinley said that his committee
veriﬁed this previous recount
which was undertaken shortly aft-
er the elections and called it “fair
and accurate.” . »

As provided for in the Con-
gress Constitution, the women’s
nominating committee met yester-
day with the responsibility of
breaking the tie and will announce
its decision today.

Ten Top Women Meet

This committee, headed by J anei

Dobrosielski, WSGA president, is

made up of the heads of ten topﬁt

campus women’s organizations.‘
The method of breaking‘ the
tie came in for sharp debate ,

ly settled.

Paper Pick Up

Approximately 45,000 pounds of

$281 last Saturday by teams from
_ 14 of Pitt’s fraternities.
The money was turned over to
Pittsburgh’s Hill City project. _
Jack Grodin, chairman of the
IF Hill City Drive, said that the
goal was exceeded by a comfort-
‘ able margin.
. He also felt that if 100 trucks

were made available to the IF
committee next- year they could
easily be filled with waste paper.
John Atkins, leader of Local
249 of the Trucker’s Union, prom-
ised that if Pitt’s fraternities were
interested in such a drive again
next year, his union would be glad
to supply 100 trucks free of
charge.

Appointments For Draft Test
Are Fast Running Short

Appointments are fast running out for the May 26 date
for taking the Selective Service aptitude test.. V’
According to Dr. William Turnbull, vice-president of the

Princeton Educational T e s tin g6
Service which is administering the
test, college men who want to take
it before the spring semester ends
had better apply immediately.

Turnbull, who spoke Sunday on
the “Youth and the Draft” radio
program, stated that 140,000 ap-
plications have been received "to
date.

This ﬁgure, far lower than was
expected at the testing headquar-
ters, is expected to rise to more
than 500,000 eventually. These lat-
er applicants will probably receive
the June 16 or June 30 appoint-
ments.

Major General Lewis B. Her-
shey, Selective Service director,
has strongly urged all draft eligi-
ble‘ college men to take the test.

Although the present draft calls
have shrunk, as he pointed out re-
cently, a test score on ﬁle at the
local draft board is a good recom-
mendation for deferment should
future changes raise manpower
needs.

Pittsburgh

Progress  

By WASH GJEBRE
Staﬁ‘ Reporter

Pittsburgh Progress is the subject of_ an article in this

month’s Atlantic Monthly.

Karl Schriftgiesser, author of “The Pittsburgh Story,”
says that Pittsburgh is beneﬁting by the “master plan,” a pro-

gram calling for better routing¢-

of through traffic for quicker ac-
cess to the airport, slum clear-
ance , park development, and
smoke control.

“Pittsburgh was a ‘used’ city,”
says Mr. Schriftgiesser, “and eco-
nomic considerations beyond the
control of Pittsburghers seemed
to be conspiring against the city
and its surrounding towns.

Executives Worried

“At worried board meetings to-
wards the war’s end there was
more and more talk about ‘leav-
ing Pittsburgh; and no plans for
post-war expansion lay on execu-
tive desks after vast industrial
expansion was taking place in the
West.” ‘

Then, as Pittsburghers say
“the smoke cleared” follow-
ing the passage of the anti-
smoke ordinances. The gov-
ernment got busy; federal
money came in to support the
proposed program for ﬂood
control, highways, and new
airport.

The noted journalist goes on to
list the many improvements, men-
tioning the Conemaugh Darn Proj-
ect, the Pennsylvania Turnpike,
the Greater Pittsburgh Airport,
the new Gateway Center, and sis-
ter buildings to the Cathedral of
Learning, such as the Alcoa Build-
mg.

Tribute To Builders

Continuin in his article Mr.
Schriftgiesser pays tribute to the
persons who have made this city
come into being.

Festival Stunt

2 Pitt Students To Make
Allegheny Canoe Trip

By'I‘IM

KOVAR

Staff Reporter

,— Two Pitt students from Warren, Pa. will canoe down the
Allegheny River as a publicity stunt for the Spring Festival

“Pitt Goes West.”

James Rock and Lewis McCol1ough, both former Eagle

Warren Friday, May 11, and dock
near the Point Bridge at noon
Monday, May 14.

In keeping with the western
theme of the Festival, both stu-
dents will be dressed in full In-
dian regalia, complete with head-
dress and war paint, and will be
paddling a canoe dubbed “The
Panther.”

Trip Covers Old Route

The trip will cover the old route
used by the logging rafts of yes-
ter-year. The grandfather of

James Rock was one of the first.

men to make this trip in Pitts-
burgh’s early history.

Rock and McCol1ough will be
roughing it on this unique trip,
sleeping in the open and cooking
their meals along the way.

The young canoers will pass
through cities that were mere
spots in the wilderness 20 years
ago — Oil City, Brady’s Bend,
Franklin, and Oakmont will be
some of the check points along the
way.

They will also have to pass
"through eight locks on the river,
a situation not encountered by the
logging rafts.

Both Activities Men

Rock, a pre—med junior, is pres-
ident of Sigma Pi, a member of
Druids, the Pitt Riﬂe Team and
Alpha Phi Omega, honorary serv-
ice fraternity.

Pitt Chest Falls Short

 

"is

In Spring Campaign   r I

The Pitt Chest drive fell
“far short” of its goal in the
recent campaign conducted on
campus.

According to ﬁgures released
by Richard Cunningham, assistant
to the dean of men, the Chest re-
ceived $l278.l9 in the spring cam-
paign.

Though the spring receipts
fell below expectations, the
fall and /spring drives togeth-
er managed to bring in about
three-fourths of the $9000
goal. Red feather workers
netted $6128 last fall.
Speaking of the disappointing

spring campaign, Alfred C. Payne,
executive secretary of the YMCA,
said, “The Pitt Chest Council
hasn’t met yet to evaluate the cam-

but at

paign or approve the allocations,
the next meeting we } will
discuss the advantages of having
either one or twodrives a year.

._ Too often-——and especially around Spring Festival time

-_-we tend to forget the primary aim of a University, which
isto educate the student.
 Since Student Congress elections, IF Ball queens, and
yalty oath debates make more interesting reading than
diligent research and scholastic achievement, you’ll rarely
read of the latter in these pages, nor will Tuck Shop chatter
or even Faculty Club shop talk include it.

 Once a year, however, the University takes time out to
recognize the normally unsung scholastic wheels at a short
but ﬁtting ceremony in Stephen Foster Memorial Hall.
Today happens to be that time, Scholars Day, and the
ceremony is at 1:30. If you’re free, Why not drop over there
 take a look at the real campus wheels-—---the ones who.
make the world go ’round? You might ﬁnd some of your
classmates there on the stage. '

D '
Vile hope that this week will see the end of the Penn-
sylvania ‘loyalty oath’ issue, and that the Harrisburg legisla-

‘tors will have the Wisdom and decency to let Senate Bill
27 die of its own diseases.

 The bill, conceived in ignorance, passed in passion, and
supported out of — stubbornness and fear, is potentially as
dangerous as the evil it seeks to ﬁght. To make it into law
would transform the bulwark of democracy into the prison
wall of totalitarianism. ,
Make no mistake: we fear and hate the designs and de-
Nices of Russian Communism. We would‘ willingly shed our
last drop of blood in defending the principles of American
Democracy against it. (Under the circumstances in which
we ﬁnd ourselves, this is no idle statement.)
Yet equally do we fear the threat to our liberty from
»,within, the insidious and, for the most part, unrecognized
ﬁmovement to restrict our constitutional rights by legisla-
tion. The chains of slavery weigh just as heavily when forged
Q by our own hands as those with a Made-in-Stalingrad stamp.
 So we ask that the lawmakers throw the Pechan bill

on the scrap-heap and instead ‘fashion an anti-Communist
Weapon that won’t backﬁre.

of its students.

Much slammed at the bar of criticism lately, the SC
has need of some vindication. The press has been bad‘-
dirty politics, throat cutting, useless debate on trivial mat-

Far from being an anemic bunch of legislative amoebae,
the Pitt Student Congress is a hard-working gang of men
and women trying to better the University, and the position

ters, inefficiency at times.

We hear all the bad about the
eighteen men and women on Con-
gress and ignore their positive ac-
complishments.

Looking Backwards

Looking backwards, we can see
the long list of things which Con-
gress has either done by itself or
supported. They include things
which no other organization on
campus could have done, every-
thing from a Notre Dame train
trip to a series of special chapel
services. '

Student Congress is worth de-
fending. ‘In the ﬁrst place it is

one of the few organizations on

campus which can be a positive
force toward getting rid of the
Pitt inferiority complex.

Inferioriiy Complex Evident-
That complex is evident in all

the things the Pitt? student does

and thinks. You meet it outside

the school in the continual cracks"

that “if you can’t go to college go
to Pitt.”

Congress, working closely with
the dean of men’s office, has long
tried to combat this feeling. It has
s p o n s o r e d dances, speeches,
movies, High School Day, pep
rallies in an attempt to get an

esprit de corps going.

-
Also, student government is
needed, especially in the ﬁeld of
social activities. Congress does in-
dispensable work in setting up so-_
cial rules and working with the
University social committee.
Fundamentally C o n g r e s s il
sound. Every now and then if!
members tangle in political bat-
tles and we sneer at them. Look
at its realistically, though, and
you can see nothing wrong with a
bit of “dirt” now and then.
Serious This Year
This year the Congressmen have
been a serious bunch, too sober at
times, perhaps. They have con,-
trasted sharply with the three-
ring Congress we had last year '
when the “Filthy Five” ran things.
If other student governing
groups on other campuses exhibit

l

the same vigor and strength that L

the Pitt Congress does, it would
be safe to say that student gov-
ernment in general is OK, too.

Two hundred seventy-two
freshman men, expecting to
return to Ellsworth Center

The Center is being closed this
June and all is not well with stu-
dent morale. Surprisingly enough,
many of the fellows are quite put
out and don’t want to come to the
Cathedral.

When questioned on his reaction

Wohlhieder replied, “I’m sorry
they’re closing it. We had a lot
of good times here.”

‘Closing a Mistake‘ _ _
Joseph Yut, in agreement, said
“Ellsworth Center is a ﬁne P13Ce
in which to start college work,
and I think closing it is a mus.-
take!”

Another freshman, Steve Beer-
ing, answered, “Ellsworth has be-
come a home to us and we’re go-
ing to miss it,” while Howard
Schubel, a man of few words, ex-
claimed, “Damn shame!” .
Perhaps the most heartbreaking
reply was that of Ronald Esper’s
--—“‘The closing of Ellsworth Cen-
ter touches me deeply.”

Some others, not set in any par-
ticular opinion, include Ronald
Hugh who responded “hate to see
it go, but I’ll be glad to get to the
Cathedral” and Richard Ulrner
who answered “I liked it at” Ells-
worth. The only thing wrong was
-—no women!”

Some Students Reioice

There are a few, however, who
are in favor of the decision. Ex-
plained Fred Bell, “I believe the
closing of Ellsworth will give the
students here an opportunity to
become more active in University
functions.”

A colleague, Samuel Millstone,
said “I’m glad it’s going. It’s good
because it’s compact, but it lacks
the feeling of the University.”
Jack Boyd merely remarked .“very
good idea.”

Ll/ost Has

Role in Movies

By WILLIAM DELSERONE
Sports Writer

So you want to be in pic-
tures?

Then listen to Tackle Char-
ley Yost—-a person who has
had a ﬂeeting experience with
the Hollywood method. He’ll
tell you motion-picture acting
isn't everything people think it is.

Now don’t get him wrong. The
six-foot, 209-pound Charley really
enjoyed his one-day job as an
extra in the forthcoming “Angels
and the Pirates.” But he wouldn’t
.want to do it all the time.

“It’s the number of times they
shoot the_ scene that gets you,”
says Charley.

‘-‘I know after the tenth ‘take’

" of the scene I was in, the whole

deal became very tiresome.”

Charley Lifts Hero

The scene Charley mentions
happens to be the one in which
he—along with another extra-
rushes out of the Pirate dugout
and lifts actor Bruce Bennett on
his shoulders.

That bit of dramatics results
when Bennett wins the ﬁnal game
of the season—and thus sends the
Pirates into the World Series.

“For that brief scene, which
needed 20 ‘takes’, I received
twelve dollars,” laughs Charley.

The Pitt footballer also got quite
a chuckle out of the number of
times it took Bennett to put the
ball across the plate for the ﬁnal
pitch. 1

, Bennett No Ace

particular scene since both the

out on the ﬁeld had to be accom-
plished in one shot. '

As Charley puts it: “It must
have taken Bennett twenty pitches
before he could put the ball over
the plate. And on each delivery,
we had to tear out of the dugout
and lift Bennett on our shoulders.

“Finally, on the twentieth pitch,
he got the ball over the plate and
the batter .missed it. Then the
scene was completed.”

Built Like Bennett

Incidentally, it was quite by ac-
cident that Yost got his ‘starring’
role. Seems MGM contacted Bob

Artman and wanted two athletes

about the same build as Bruce
Bennett. Yost happened to meet
the requirements.

The one thing that caught
Charley’s fancy was the treatment
given him and the other extras by
actors Paul Douglas and Bennett.

“I thought because they were
actors, they would act high-hatted.
But that never once was the case.”

Other Pitt athletes—in addition
to Yost—who ﬁlled in as extras
were John Dazio, Ted Geremsky,
Bill Gasparovic, Chris Warriner,
Jim Campbell, No'rm Chizmar,
Bill Priatko, Don Virostek, and
Wade Jones.

‘It was announced today that four more former Panthers .
had agreed to play for the Old-Timers. They are Bobby Lee
Bill Abraham, Walt Cummins, and Emil Naric. ’

The ﬁrst two mentioned weic¢

members of the Panthers of 1949.
Lee, a blocking back, and Abra-
ham, a halfback, played on the
last football squad coached by
Mike Milligan.
Single Wing Revived

Chickerneo had to go away back
in the yesteryear to come up with
Naric. A former halfback for the
Blue and Gold, Naric played in
1939 under the tutelage of Char-
ley Bowser.

A 1948 backﬁeld star, Cummins
has been lined up to play quar-
terback in the single-wing, for the
Old-Timers. Chickerneo will re-
vive the single wing for the Var-
sity-Alumni contest. '

For a punter Chickerneo has a
pretty good man in Bill Hardisty,
who played for the Panthers in
1949. Known as “Big Boom”
Hardisty averaged more than 40
yards per kick during his college-
playing days.

He is now head football coach
at Claysville high school.

Bucknell, 6-3, and Penn State, 5-

try redeem themselves against

Navy at Annapolis this afternoon}

Following this match they will
meet West Virginia in their ﬁrst
home meet of the season on Fri-
day at 3 p.m. on the Mellon
courts.

The big surprise of the Buck-
nell battle beside the loss was the
defeat of Johnny Lohstoeter by
Paul Remney 9-7, 7-5.

Harry Campney and Bob Ilise-
vich were the only singles win-

ners for the Blue and Gold.

Lohstoeter fared a little better

' in the doubles as he teamed with

Campney to win 6-1, 6-6. The
Bisons conceded the second set
because of darkness.

In the State match Campney

' was moved up to the number one

spot and he came through with
ﬂying colors as he defeated the
State ace, Owen Landon. Loh-
stoeter, the number two man for
this meet, then defeated tough
Dick Wieland. The other singles
winners was Bob Ilisevich.

Campney and Lohstoeter com-

V bined to win their doubles match

and the meet was decided in the
last doubles encounter of the aft-
ernoon when Ilisevich and Harry
Duncan lost a heartbreaker 6-4,

If the Pitt baseballers think they have had a hard time »
winning at home, wait till they encounter the Navy ball-
hawks at Annapolis, Maryland this afternoon.

The Middies and Panthers have met one common foe—-
West Virginia. Navy won that game, 15-2, while the Mounties
blanked the Panthers here last week, 7-0.

2-6 and carries a three—game

Good Pitch, No Hit

The Panthers must improve in
the ﬁeld and sharpen up at bat if
they expect to do any winning
this season. Coach Ralph Mitter-
ling has ‘been able to get good
pitching from three regulars, Bob
Russell, Paul Lomond, and Ray
Hollis, and excellent hitting from
catchers Chuck Gibson and Ollie
Niemela.

The rest of the team, however,
has not produced at bat or in the
ﬁeld. Last weekend, the mittmen
lost two games to Notre Dame,
5-1 and 10-5. In Friday’s game
Irish hurler Stari Konopka pitched
a one-hitter with only six Pan-

losing streak into today’s _contest.¢

Jim Williams leads off and plays
left field. Niemela moves up to
third in the batting order after

thers reaching base.

Saturday’s efforts were some-’
what improved as the Panthers
lost out in the eleventh inning. Pitt
collected 12 hits for their biggest
output of the season, but also com-
mitted four errors to bring their
season total to the amazing ﬁgure
of 37 in eight games.

was moved to the Cathedral in
1936.

During World ‘War II the Room
was occupied by the Civil Aﬁairs
School for a period of six months.
This necessitated the removal of
the books to the lending depart-
ment of the University library.

Idea Was Alldred’s

The idea for the room started
with Peter Alldred, born in South
Side, Pittsburgh, in 1837. His isn’t
simply a story of the “idle rich.”
When his father died, Peter A11-
dred, only seventeen years old,
was forced to support seven other
children in the family.

During the Civil War he served
as hospital steward in the Fifty-
second Regiment of Pennsylvania
Volunteers. Later, using his train-
ing as a chemist, he went into the
drug business. He became wealthy,
and began to travel widely and
collect books.

Interested in Books

Peter Alldred was not interested
in scholarly works. He read any-
thing that appealed to him, and
his interests were diverse. His last
years were spent almost entirely
among his books in the library."

Only half of the collection is
kept on the shelves. The other half
are in the stacks but are inter-
changed often enough so that the
same books are not always on the
shelves.

The newer books are displayed
on tables together with much-used’
books.

A fund, established in 1922 by
John Alldred, the last surviving
member of the family provides
for newer books which the gen-
eral library might ordinarily buy.

The room’s books are listed in
both the general library catalogue
and the catalogue in the Alldred
Room.

Writer’s. Conference Called
Success By Visiting Authors

Henry Volkening, literary agent and speaker at last
week’s ’writer’s' conference, said that he had never seen a
student body more realistic than Pitt’s in itsconception of the

difficulties of getting published.
Other speakers, too, were gen-

erous in praise of the conference.

Frank Luther Mott, dean of the
University of Missouri School of
Journalism, claimed that it was
one of the best-run conferences
that he had ever attended.

Caroline’ Gordon described the
conference as a very “literary”
one, and John Crowe Ransom, edi-
tor of the Kenyon Review, praised

the graduate students whom he’

addressed.

Mr. Ransom also was gratified
at the change in Pittsburgh itself.
He said the city reminded him of
“a strong man all‘ cleaned up.”

As a literary agent, Henry Vol-
kening, was interested in ,Martin
Madancy’s story in MSS, A Crown
for a King. Mr. Volkening asked
if the story was eligible for out-
side publication.

He was informed by Edwin L.
Peterson, editor of MSS, that Ma-
dancy had just sold the story to
Extension Magazine.

Improved Anti-Flu Vaccine

Developed In Pitt Virus Lab

Dr. Lonas E. Salk, head of the Virus Research laboratory
here, has announced the discovery of an improved inﬂuenza

According to Dr. Salk, this_vacc1ne should give greater
‘_—""*immunity

T. o. w. B. o. o. T.  

against inﬂuenza to
more people and for a longer per-
iod of time. He added, however,
that only time can tell if this is
an absolute answer for protection
against inﬂuenza.
Results Promising‘ '
The Pittsburgh Press quoted Dr.
Salk as saying, “The results ob-
tained so far on both animals and
humans are very promising and
very hopeful.”

This new vaccine is made up of
three different ﬂu viruses, plus a
special type of mineral oil. The
oil is the main feature of the vac-
cine.

It perks up the production of ﬂu
ﬁghters in the body and it keeps
them in a person’s system for a
longer time than was possible with
other vaccines.

There is no danger of a person
getting the disease when he is in-
noculated because the vaccine is
made of dead influenza viruses.

Developed Other Vaccine

Dr. Salk helped develop a dif-
ferent vaccine when he was at the
University of Michigan. The old-
er vaccine, however, did not pro-
duce as many ﬂu ﬁghters in the
body as the new one and they did
not have as long a life.
