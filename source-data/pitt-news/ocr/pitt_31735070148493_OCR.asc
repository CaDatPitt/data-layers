Professor values   social capita

Kelly Lyons
‘‘ . For The Pitt News

Harvard professor Robert Put-
nam believes that social con-
nections are more valuable than
college degrees.

Putnam, a professor ofpub—
lic policy at thejohn F. Kennedy
School of Government at Har-
vard University, spoke to about
150 people in the ballroom of
the University Club on Friday
about the importance of social
capital in society during his
lecture, titled “Social Capital
and Equality.”

The author of a number of

famous books on political sci-
ence —— most notably.“Bowling
Alone” and “Making Democracy

Work” —— came to present to his-

guests the idea of social capital.
Putnam defined social capital
as social connections with oth-
ers, and he explained how valu-
able these connections can be
to the economy and soc_iety’s
well—being.

When it comes to jobs, Put-
nam acknowledged that tools
and training are important,
but he said that most people
are hired because they hear
about positions from friends
of friends.

“The value of friends is
greater than the value of your

degree,” he said.
Putnam also remarked that it

has been proven that a socially .

isolated person’s health over
his lifetime is roughly equiva-
lent to the health of a lifetime
smoker. ‘

“Your chances of dying
within the next 12 months are
cut in halfbyjoining one social

group,” he said. . .

Putnam emphasized to
younger audience members that
his subject, social capital,*“is
a crucially important public-
policy issue for the rest ofyour
life.”

Yet the political scientist
also took a moment to empha-
size that not all social networks

are positive. Putnam used al-
Qaida as an example ofa nega-
tive social network. '
Putnam said that social iso-
lation has increasedduring
this recession, as _it did dur-
ing the Great Depression. The
increased social isolation _can
and has, in Putnam’s opinion,
— caused income inequality and
social trust of one anotherto
decline. He said that the U.S.
needs first to develop social
capital before it can fix the
problem of income inequal-
ity that the- country currently
faces. .
‘ Although he noted that “it’s
not fair,” Putnam said that it’s

invitation

Phil Aitken
For The Pitt News

It’s been in the news for a while, but
,Pitt’s move to the Atlantic Coast
Conference just got its official
stamp of approval.

The Executive Committee of

_Pitt’s Board of Trustees hosted a_
‘ ﬁve-minute conference call Friday _
afternoon, during which it voted

unanimously to withdraw from the
Big East Conference and formally
accept the ACC’s invitation.

'l University spokesman john
Fedele said the vote will not need
to go before the full board.

‘At a meeting held last week, the
Board of Trustees discussed the
possibility of‘ Pitt joining the ACC
as part of the NCAA realignment.
After a presentation from
Chancellor
and Pitt Athletic Director Steve

Pederson, the board sent a letter
-to ACC oﬂicials to express Pitt’s

interest in becoming a member of

the conference.

The ACC Council of Presidents
voted unanimously to invite Pitt
and Syracuse University into the
conference over the weekend.

During a teleconference on
Sept. 18, Chancellor Nordenberg
said, “We were ﬂattered by the
ACC’s interest in us. We’re grateﬁil
to receive the invitation to join this
very special conference and feel

' privileged to be moving forward in _

UPMC announces proposal for Oakland expansion

Danny Zaidi
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center wants to start
laying the groundwork for some
future expansion in the Oakland
area.

UPMC otﬁcials have
announced a proposal to plan the
construction of a 12—story clinical
services and patient care building
in place of the old Children’s
Hospital building on Fifth Avenue
at DeSoto Street.

The Children’s Hospital
moved to its current campus in
Lawrenceville in May 2009, and
a green lawn has since taken its

“It is important to understand
that this is just a tentative
proposed plan. Nothing is
conﬁrmed or approved yet,”

UPMC spokeswoman Susan
Manko said.

Department of City Planning
zoning‘ administrator Susan

Tymoczko said that UPMC has
yet to submit any part of its plan
to her department.

Regarding‘ the length oftime it
takesforapprovalforconstruction
on this scale, Tymoczko said
that, “It’s a legislative process by
zoning code.”

Manko said there is no set time
frame for the approval process by
the City Planning Commission,
but she said it will most likely
begin next spring.

The proposed plan comes as

‘ a result of UPMC’s Institutional

Master Plan process —— a planning

a fact that people’s overall life-
time success can be predicted
by how successful their parents
were. Middle class parents are
able to spend more time with
their kids, whereas working
class family time is often dis-
rupted by economic anxiety,
Putnam said. Putnam believes
that the government should fo-
cus more on this problem.
Maggie O’Brien, a second-
year master’s GSPIA student,
has read a number of Putnam’s
works. ' A
“[Putnam’s] kind of famous
in the realm of political sci-
ence,” she said. '
Najeeb Shafiq, an assistant

- professor at Pitt’s School of

Education, said Putnam writes
with ease about his topics.

“It’s so dense, but it’s so well
crafted,” Shaﬁq said.

Maureen Porter, an associate
professor of anthropology at
the School ofEducation, agreed
with Shafiq. P .

“Hetakes complex ideas an

makes them easily accessible,”
Porter said.

David Miller, the director
of the Center for Metropoli-
tan Studies at GSPIA, invited
Putnam to participate in the
Wherrett Lecture Series on L0-

cal Government, which has his— .

torically “brought scholars and
thinkers” to Pitt. The Wherrett
Lecture Series focuses on prob-
lems of local government.
Miller said that Putnam was
an appropriate speaker be-

" cause he is “cutting-edge” and

“changing culture.”

The lecture at Pitt ‘worked
out for the weekend because
Putnam was planning on run-
ning in the Great Race with his
grandchildren on Sunday.

Porter emphasized her inter-
est in Putnam’s work, although
she’s not doing research in his
specific field of studies. Porter
is an anthropologist, and her
friend Shaﬁq is an economist.

“[We’re] both sitting here
because we’re drawn to his
work,” Porter said. I

Scalia praises Catholic law
school education

Danny Zaidi
For The Pitt News

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia visited
Duquesne’s Law School to help celebrate its
100th-year anniversary.

Catholic Law Schools served as the topic of
Scalia’s Centennial Keynote Address Saturday
at the A]. Palumbo Center.

Scalia spoke in front of more than 800
people at the celebration about the ways in

which he has tried to keep his religion from _

inﬂuencing his decisions on the Supreme
Court, and he praised Duquesne’s approach of
defending moral judgments based on religious
views. '

Since Scalia himself is a Catholic, the dean
of the university asked him to speak about a
Catholic law school education.

“Does my identity as a Catholic affect my
legal decisions?” Scalia said.

Scalia, who attended ‘Harvard Law School,

emphasized that religion and law do not cross
paths in his decision—making as a Supreme
Court justice and as a Catholic. He cited his
stance on abortion. A
“My honest. reading of the [Constitution]
shows that it says nothing about abortion,” he
said. _ -

EDITORIAL

Digital badges
promising

For decades, Americans have
regarded college as a necessary
rite of passage to obtain a high-
paying job. Now, however, some
commentators predict that a bur-
geoning technology will give the
four-year, ﬁnancially taxing ex-
perience a run forgits money.

In a Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation blog post last Thursday,

editorial director Jeffrey Selin-

go praised the ingenuity of the
digital badge system —— a new,
pioneering certiﬁcation infra-
structure that aims to redeﬁne
what we value in post—secondary
education. The badges — which
companies, online courseware
providers, colleges and commu-
nity groups all have the power
to bestow —— will recognize and
symbolize, among other qualiﬁ-

cations, experience and skills _in

outside—the-classroom learning
and critical thinking, communi-
cation and information aggrega-

' tion. Most excitingly, perhaps,
Selingo expects that the badges /
will provide links to the papers,

transcripts and other documents
completed to earn them.

' Selingo is not -alone in his
enthusiasm for the plan. A few
weeks ago, the John D. and Cath-
erine T. MacArthur Foundation
announced a $2 million compe-

tition to develop a standardized‘

badge system. At the announce-
ment, U.S. Secretary of Educa-
tion Arne Duncan, in partnership
with the Department of Veterans
Affairs, pledged $25,000 for the
best badge—system prototype
that would service veterans seek-
ing high-paying jobs.

Of course, despite what Selin-
go suggests in his blog, it would
take a truly remarkable technol-
ogy to completely supplant tradi-

tional higher education. College,
after all-, provides an almost un-
beatable set of professional op-
portunities, including access to

_ instruction in many possible ca-

reer ﬁelds and a vast network of
connections. -
Nonetheless, the badge sys-
tem carries several important
beneﬁts. First and foremost, its

‘ ability to correlate documents
.with their resulting qualiﬁca-
tions would provide employers ‘
. an invaluable opportunity to as-

sess applicants’_ actual strengths.
Instead of simply reading “proﬁ-
cient in HTML” on a candidate’s

resume, for example, a human

resources department would be
able to determine for itself how
extensive an applicant’s training
really was.

Additionally, as aforemen-
tioned champions have noted,
a badgesystem could serve as a
more a_ffordable, albeit less au-
thoritative, alternative to college
degrees — the digital equivalent
of trade school. And for those
who earned their bachelor’s de-
grees along time ago, the badges
could act as supplements to high-
er education — extra certiﬁca-
tion for when college _degrees in
themselves are insufﬁcient.

Of course, much as with col-
lege degrees,’ employers should
take into account the sources of
badges — many companies and
organizations will doubtlessly
dole them out all too readily and
thereby diminish their value. But
as with any new idea, the badge
system’s possibilities, at least
for now, overshadow its down-
sides. As tuition-paying college
students, we’d welcome any chal-
lenge to the entrenched superior-
ity of traditional academia. I

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Social Security a Ponzi scheme

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

Rick Perryhas away of gettingliberals
eitherto smirk orto scream.

One ofhis latest claims —— that
Social Security is a Ponzi scheme —
engendered both reactions. Perhaps
it wasn’t the most politically astute
thingto say, as itadds upto almost
perfect ammunition for Jon Stewart.
Yet amid all the mirth and irritation
following the Texan’s remark, a ques-
tion remains: -

Was his statement unfair?

No, itwasn’t.

A Ponzi scheme begins when
someone pretends to start a mutual
fund —— that is,. a system in which a
bunch of people contribute money to
a pool to buy a set of stocks -and other
securities. Real mutual ﬁmds have the

advantage of providing a lot of money t

that can be invested by the ﬁmd man-
agers in a diverse selection of secu-
rities.‘ As a result of the investment
diversity, participants can effectively
buy a thousandth ofa  in_1,o00

olwccnar-urn

companies instead of one share in one
company. This diversiﬁcation should
eamamorepredictableret11rn,wl1ich
is split between participants in the
fund and the managers who bought
and sold the actual st_ocl<s. Those
who participate in the mutual ﬁmd
can continue to watch their nest eggs
gow on paper, or they can demand
their money and cash out.

A Ponzi scherner takes advantage
ofthe fact that avast majority ofpeo-

' ple don’t know what’s going on with

the money in a mutual ﬁtnd at any one
time, as well as the fact that as many
people are depositing money in a mu-
tualﬁmd, fewerarepullingtheir mon-
ey out. A schemerbets that as longas
people keep depositing more money
in the “ﬁmd,” he can pay those who
are withdrawing from the scheme
with that inﬂux of deposits. The scam-
mercanmakemoneybysiphoningoff
some of the cash that is ﬂowing ﬁ‘om
people paying in and people cashing
out. As long as more money is ﬂowing
into the scheme than ﬂowing out —
and the government doesn’t connect
the dots —-— nobody will be the wiser.
Compare Social Security. Workers

-rurv¢I¢9vouuI~s¢v4rov-

pay a tax on their incomes, matched
by contributions from their employ-

, ers. Money is collected into a pool,

and the pool is used to pay out bene-
ﬁts. This is OK as long as more people
arepayingintothesystemthanare
 beneﬁts. In the past, Social
Security ran a large surplus, stacking
up a $2.5 trillion dollar reserve to dip
into. In March 2010 The New York
Times said, “For accounting purpos-
es, the systems accumulated revenue
is placed in Treasury securities.” The
reserve is composed of money the
government owes to itself. However;
Social Security paid out more than it
took in in 2010, so now the govem—
ment has to pay itself the money it
owes to itself. Does anyone see a prob-
lem?

To recap,- Social Security is a sys-
tem in which money is taken from
people putting money into a fund,
and paid out directly to people who
withdraw money from the fund. The
surplus is loaned to the government,
which spends it and promises to pay
itself back later. A Ponzi scheme is

fund, and those who want out are
paid directly with the money put into
the fund. Any surplus is spent by the
person running the scheme. The ba-
sic mechanism ofboth concepts is the
same, although the latter, of course, is
illegal. '

So why do some argue that Social
Security is not a Ponzi scheme? In a
discussion on the New York Times’
website, Paul Pierson of the University
of California, Berkeley, argues that the
government can raise taxes and jigger

the beneﬁt structure to sustain the
program. For this reason, he posits,
Social Security is sustainable whereas
Ponzi schemes are not. However,
when we reduce this argument to its
essence, all it says is that Social Securi-
ty cannot be a Ponzi scheme because
it can use the law to remain in busi-
ness. If Bernie Madoff had been able
to force people to contribute to his
scheme or revise the expected payoff
he promised people,would he have be
accused of a retirement fund
instead of a Ponzi scheme?

that Social Security is not a Ponzi‘

scheme is that Ponzi schemes are
disingenuous whereas everybody
knows how Social Security works.
However, that Social Security is “com-
mon knowledge” ‘is an assumption.
You could also assume that every-
body knows the basics of how the
government works, but 38 percent of
1,000 randomly chosen Americans
in a Newsweek poll wouldn’t pass the
citizenship test administered to for-
eigners seeking naturalization. Social
Security also operates on the lie that
beneﬁciaries are simply paid back

In a game during which both teams

sion to produce the ﬁnal score.

The Panthers could’ve pulled

' away earlier in the game, but penal-

ties and twice settlingfor ﬁeld goals

Pitt from building its advan-

“We just have to learn how to ﬁn-

we’re going to. We’re so close we can

lead on their ﬁnal drive of the game,

CLUB SPORTS

 

Club. teams set goals,

prepare for seasons

Jasper Wilson
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s club sports teams have set some

high goals this season: The roller

hockey team wants to go to nationals
for the second consecutive year, and
the Division II men’s ice hockey team
is focused on winning its league.
Since" returning to campus, the

teams’ leaders have focused on hold— .

ing tryouts and ﬁnalizing their ros-
ters, looking to put together the right
combination of returning players and
newcomers to make the goals achiev-
able.

Club sports teams compete with
teams from other universities, but
theirathletes aren’t on athletic schol-
arships and the teams aren’t governed
by the NCAA.

While play has begun forfsome
clubs — men’s rugby competed in a
tournament over Labor Dayweekend
-—. others are still preparing for the
start of their seasons.

The Pitt News checked in with
some of the teams on campus to see
where club sports at Pitt stand early
inthe school year, i

Ice Hockey I .

Dennis Wilson, captain of the Divi-
sion H men’s ice hockey team, said that
histeamwill accept “nothinglessthan
winning the league” this year, after
losing to Dayton in overtime of the
Tri-State Collegiate'Hockey League
championship game last March.

Pitt only lost a few players to
graduation and returns several» se-
niors who have played together for
three years. The team added nine
new players through tryouts and two
have experience playing collegiate
club hockey. L

. ‘Wilson said that a league—ﬁnals O’

rematch  Dayton is likely, as the
opponent didn’t lose many players to
graduation either. '

V‘ L Destefano, sophomore and president

Ralph

ofthe-rollerhockeyteam‘, said he feels
conﬁdent that Pitt roller hockey can
make a return trip this year.

 victory over Slippery Rock.

The second—semester return of
two veteran players from study abroad
will strengthen the team’s chances.
The season runs from October to the
beginning of April.

Tryouts, which concluded overthe
weekend, brought players capable of
contributing from the start, and that’s
imperative given the small tumover_
the team experienced, Destefanm
said.

The squad’s goal is to make it back
to Division II nationals, where it ﬁn-

ished in the top eight last year.

To accomplish this goal, the team
mustwinits league, the Eastern Colle-
giate Roller Hockey Association, or do
well enough during the regular season
to receive an at-large bid —— the route
Pitt took last year.

Slippery Rock, which ﬁnished
second to Pitt in the Keystone Con- ‘

ference and also received an at-large-.

bid to nationals, will likely challenge
the Panthers in the division.

SUNY Binghamton mightprovide
the biggest challenge forthe Panthers
at regionals,which consists ofthe top
eight teams from the Eastern Colle-
giate Roller Hockey Association. Pitt
beat the Bearcats during the regular
season last year, but Binghamton
eventually defeated the Panthers to
win the region.

Pitt moved down to Division II two
years ago. Destefano said that division
placement for teams is performance-
based, and if the Panthers do well in
Division II again this year, they could
get bumped up to Division 1.

COLUMN

Sunseri needs more time to prove himself

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

Herewe areagain,watchingaPittfoot—

, _ ball team that isn’t meeting the high
’— or high-octane —- expectations of .

its fan base.

Just a few short weeks ago, Pan-
ther fans seemed full of excitement
and hope for Pitt football, believing
that Pitt couldwin anoutright BigEast
Championship and clinch a berth to a
BCS bowl game.

The sudden change of attitude from
excitement for the season to anger at
new head coach Todd Graham, his
system and the team shouldn’t come

., as a surprise to those of us that have
watched Pitt sports for more than one
or two years. When haven’t fans pro-
tested at the supposed incompetence
of a team’s players and coaches?

It seems like the latest hot issue for
football fans is redshirt junior quar-
terback Tino Sunseri. Through four
games, Sunseri has completed 82 of
his 126 passes for 823 yards with four
touchdowns and four interceptions.

In the same four games during

' which Sunseri completed 65.1 percent

 einz   I

of his passes, he’s played through in-
creasingly frequent and intense bouts
of “boos” from Pitt fans.

Sofar,ﬁrst—yearhead coach Graham
has stood by his quarterback. Graham
seems more realistic than the average
Pitt faithful. Itwas wishﬁilthinkingat
besttothinkthat Sunseri could power
up the offense early on in the season.

Despite the fact that he’s a redshirt
juniorwho started last season, Sunseri
is essentially a ﬁrst—year player again
as he operates a completely new of-
fensive system.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the ﬁrst
time that Pitt fans have booed their
own players at Heinz Field.

During the 2008 season, then-
redshirt-junior Bill Stull was quite the
opposite of a fan favorite. Fans heck-
led Stull with boos during that season
and repeatedly questionedhisstarting
position based on his apparent lack of
football intelligence, poorarmstrength
and lack of effort. To be fair, Stull only
completed 57 percent of his passes
and threw more interceptions than
touchdowns.

But guess what? The following sea-
son Stull emerged as an effective pres-
ence under centerforthe Panthers, as
he led a 9-3 team to the Meineke Car

Between now and the end of the
season, there will likely be plenty for
the “boo—birds” to squawkat concern-
ing Sunseri and the Panthers. Sunseri
will throw interceptions, he will be
sacked, hewillmakesomebad throws
and, yes, hewill most likely be apart of
more losses. Atthe same time, I expect
to see Sunseri build chemistry with a
group of receivers and tight ends who
are all returning next season.

Sunseri might not have a bond like
Stull had with Dorin Dickerson and

“They did a nice job. I thought we adjusted
to the things we needed to,” Notre Dame head
coach Brian Kelly said. “I think it’s the ﬁrst time
that somebody really aggressively tried to take
Mike out of the game, and it opened up some
things for us, obviously, as well.”

Eifert led the Irish in receiving with eight
catches for 75 yards. Rees ﬁnished with 216
yards and a touchdown on 24-41 passing.

The number of penalties really hurt Pitt,
Sunseri said, because each one places the Pan-
thers in a difﬁcult situation, and it’s hard for
the team to overcome negative plays.

Running back Ray Graham agreed.

“We preach so much about penalties and
being a more disciplined team out there,” he

said. “The penalties just take you off course 1  _

penalties falls on him because he needs to speak

louder and make sure that the offense can hear 1

his voice. False starts accounted forﬁve of Pitt’s
nine penalties. , I

“We had three false starts in the ﬁrst half,”
Graham said. “I think our players were, kind
of antsy.” . f .

Notre Dame also sacked Pitt’s quarterback
ﬁve times to go along with the penalties. Coach
Graham said Sunseri needs to get rid of the ball
faster to avoid thejsacks, and Sunseri agreed.

“The line is cutting, and I’m not used to the
line cutting and then working back,” he said.
“That’s a little bit less time forthe quarterback
in the pocket. I need to be able to make that
adjustment.”

Redshirt sophomore Cory-King made his
ﬁrst career start, replacing Chris Jacobson at
left guard. Jacobson will miss the rest of the
season because of a knee injury he sustained
in the fourth quarter against Iowa.

Jacobson, a redshirt senior, -will petition the
NCAA for a sixth year of eligibility.

King said he was nervous last night, but
settled down after the ﬁrst play. Even though
he makes mistakes, King said that he always
puts forth his best effort, . '

“Ijust need to get in and watch the ﬁlm,” he
said.”There are some things I need to improve

After going into the break trailing 7-6, Pitt
took the lead during the third quarter .
A roughing—the—kicker penalty gave the

Panthers another chance on their ﬁrst drive '

of the second half, and Sunseri used a°10—yard
rush and a 10-yard pass to wide receiver Mike
Shanahan to help move the team down the
ﬁeld.

Sunseri found tight end Hubie Graham in
the end zone to put Pitt ahead 12-7. Backup
quarterback Trey Anderson — who played
the third series in the ﬁrst half — came in to
attempt the two—point conversion but was
unsuccessful. 1

Todd Graham said he planned to use An-
derson in the third series this game and that
the.trend might continue in order to get the
backup quarterback some experience.

I Pitt got onthe board ﬁrst during the game

Notre Dame 23. The Panthers, although unable
to convert the good ﬁeld position into a touch-
down, went ahead 3-0 when Kevin Harper hit

' a 45-yard ﬁeld goal.

Notre Dame answered early in the second
_quarter.Jonas Gray broke through the Pitt de-
fense for 79 yards and a touchdown to put the
Fighting Irish ahead 7-3. A

Harper hit a 23-yard ﬁeld goal to make the
score 7-6, still in favor of Notre Dame, after
Pitt couldn’t convert a third-dowi'1—and—1 from
the 2—yard line. .

The Irish missed a ﬁeld goal with 19 sec-
onds. remaining in the second half, and the
teams went into the break with Notre Dame
leading 7-6. 1

Sunseri threw for 165 yards on 22-30 pass-
ing and a touchdown, and Ray Graham led
the charge on the ground with 89 yards on 21

Ultimate uses fall season

Club Sports 4 7

Women’s Rugby _

The Women’s rugby team continues its win-
ning ways, despite losing many players this
season. '

After going undefeated in the league a year
ago, the Pitt women’s rugby team is 2-0 in its
fall campaign. The Panthers dominated their
opposition, winning the past two games by a
combined score of 183-5.

The club’s goal in the spring is to repeat as

. Allegheny Rugby Union champions and go to

regiqnals.
To win the league, Pitt‘ must ﬁrst win its

a division and then the Allegheny Rugby Union

playoffs.

League rivals Slippery Rock and Indiana Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania will pose a challenge to
the Panthers’ repeat bid. S

O “The team has lots of girls that have never
played before,” secretary Kirsten Andrews
said.

She added thatthebestway to learnthe game
and gain experience is by playingin games, which
the new players will be able to do by playingwith
the squad’s B-side.

Women’s Ultimate

After graduating only four players from last
year’s squad and startingthefall season offwell,
the Pitt Women’s Ultimate team, Danger, has
nationals in its sights. ' \

In orderto qualifyfor nationals, Danger must
ﬁrst win sectionals, a competition that consists

of other Pennsylvania schools, and then Ohio V

Valley Regionals. _
Although the Ohio Valley didn’t get any auto-
matic bids last spring, one team from the region
could potentially secure an automatic bid.
Dangerfailed to qualify for nationals lastyear,
losingto Penn State 15-6 in the regional quarter-
ﬁnals.’ The team is conﬁdent that the rebuilding
phase is over and that theywill ﬁnd success this
year, team captain Bailey Moorhead said.
Although the fall season doesn’t count for

to gain experience

the spring season.

* Moorhead said that fringe players get ample
playingtime inthese tournaments, which allows
captains to do thorough evaluations before they

put the rotation together for the spring season. '

The extra time provided by the fall season
also helps the team members gain experience
playingwith one another. Coupled with practices
at the Cost Sports Center between seasons, the
fall season eliminates the needforanacljustment

Moorhead said. She said that it takes a semester
to get the offense. clicking. ' ,

nationals, the captain said, and two transfers
with prioi“crzillegiate Ultimate experience will
begin to contribute right away.

Ohio State, lastyear’s regional champion, and
Penn State, the other regional ﬁnalist, will again
provide challenges for the Danger.. O‘

Men’s Lacrosse i

The men’s lacrosse team made it to its confer-

, ence championship lastyear, losingto Michigan
~' State inthe semiﬁnals 19-3. This year, Pitthopes '

to get to the championship again.

But the road will be a bit different —as the
Central" Collegiate Lacrosse Association now‘
consists of a six-team conference instead of two
four-team’ divisions. Michigan is now an NCAA
Division I Program, and Ball State left the as-
sociation.

The Pitt team lost just three players to gradu-
ation, and team president Brian Faber said the
new players on the squad, — a mix of transfers
and freshmen, — have the ability to contribute

right away. ‘ i

With Michigan out of the equation, the team -‘

most likely to challenge the Panthers for the
conference championship is Michigan State.

Faber said the team’s goal is to qualifyfor the
Men’s Collegiate Lacrosse Association National
Championship. ’ .

Winning the conference automatically quali-
ﬁes the team, but there’s also the possibility of an
at-large bid. To prepare forthe spring season, the
team faces a ﬁve—game fall slate in addition to a
tournament at West Virginia in October. Q
