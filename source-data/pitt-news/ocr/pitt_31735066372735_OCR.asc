Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar .
told state legislators in Harris--

b‘urg yesterday that unless the state
comesthrough with extra dollars,
the university will be forced to hike

tuition forani eighth consecutive

year and cutback on) existing
programs. .

In testimony before the State
House Appropriations Commit-
tee, Posvar called on the state to
“maintain its share in funding the
institution if the university is to
continue to fully serve the educa-
tional needs of Pennsylvania. The
partnership between the common-
wealth and the university is an
investment to the benefit of all citi-
zens,” he said.  . ~

. The chancellor claimed the pro-

  

I

posed funding level is “only suffi-
cient to maintain the quality and
scope of existing programs.”

Pitt requested an appropriation

of ($85,506,200, a l5*percent

increase over the current fiscal
year’s funding. Gov. Richard
T hornburgh proposed an appro-
priation of $78,220,000, a 5.8 per-
cent increase‘.

Posvar noted that over the past
five yearsaccess to higher educa-
tion for lower and middle’ income
students has been constrained by
the tuition hikes. =

In light of the gap between

requested and actualfunding, Pos-
var said the university has under-
taken measures to seek special
funding and improve efficiency: a
$50 million _ capital campaign
which has $30 million pledged to
date; a 50 percent increase in fed-

 
   

eral research support resulting in
over $60 million in grants and con-
tracts; an internal reallocation of
$3.5 million annually from lower

to higher priority programs’; and 0'

strong efforts to increase produc-
tivity and holddown costs.
The chancellor pointed out that

‘deferred maintenance is beginning

to take its toll at the university.
“Renovations are required because

of the aging of ourbuildings and‘

the need to implement extensive
energy conservation projects. Fail-
ure to fund maintenance of facili-
ties will result. in far higher

.long-term maintenance and

replacement costs,” he said.
Posvar commended the governor
for recommending a nine percent
increase for the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assitance
Agency. “The importance of our

NeededTo Avoid Increase

state appropriation and the
PHEAA program is underscored
by the federal government's pro-
posal to sharply reduce federal

funding for student financial aid.” S
The proposed cuts could result in a I .

47 percent drop in available aid.

Posvar also noted the governor’s P
increase medical I

proposal‘ to
school funding by six percent.
“This is an encouraging step in the '
right direction, butia major short-
fall still exists,” he said... When
adjusted for inflation, funding for’
the medical school has undergone

a.53 percent decreasethe chancellor -~

pointed out. He urged serious con- r
sideration of a proposal to create a
special student loan program for.
medical students under PHEAA.

Burger Chef:Bag  
Lunches Welcome

By JEFF RUSSELL

Burger Chef has never had, never

planned to have, and never will

have a policy forbidding brown
bag lunches in\ the restaurant,
according to Burger Chef owner
Pete Maggio.

Burger Chef management was
“surprised” last week when they
read a “policy” in last W ednesday’s
Pitt News, according to Maggio.

Last week, Burger Chef manager
Vic Foster refused to comment on
the reported policy. However,
Foster (lid say “to go read the sign
on the seventeenth floor," if there
were any questions concerning the
proposed policy. The sign requests
that people do not bring’ bag
lunches into the dining area.

“-1 thinkthat someone is using
The Pitt Ne‘ius as 'a personal

- weapon to settlea vendetta against
.Bfu-rgerf Chef ,”i-Ma ggio

 

said. “What these people [in the
article] said is a lie," he said.

Regarding reports of someone
having been thrown out of Burger
Chef, Maggio said, “in five years,
we’ve never thrown anyone_out for
anything. We've never asked them
(the security guards) to escort
anyone out."

In reply to a quote in last week's
story saying “who'd want to eat
there anyway,"Maggio said, “our
customer count is higher than ever.
We‘ve never had any complaints
except for those abput not having_a
place to eat."

Burger Chef manager Vic Foster,
who referred a Pitt Nears reporter
to the sign on the l7th floor
prohibiting bag lunches in the
dining area last week, refused to
comment on "the matter when

/ What are the possibilities of

in thiscountry? Is the fact that
few studies on the long term
effects of marijuana exist the
only thing hampering its legal-
ization? What are the latest

-legalization of marijuana? To

shed some light on these ques-
tions, Forum solicited com-
ments from George Farnham,
the national director of the
National Organization -to
Reform Marijuana Laws, and

.;Pitt P-rofessor Larry Laudan.

Marij uana—also known as

1“pot," f‘reefet" and “weed”——is _
“the common name of the drug 0

prepared by drying the leaves

; and ﬂowering tops fo the plant
“Cannabis sativa or more com-
" monly known, hemp.

Once widely used medically

* in the United States to ease the
‘effects of such things as gout,

rheumatism, hydrophobia, epi-
demic cholera and tetanus,
marijuana is now.illegal.
Unlike alcohol or nicotine,
marijuana is not addictive.
Neither the tolerance or with-

-drawal symptoms have been

reliably reported. Although the
lethal dose of marijuana is not
known, ‘ no human fatalities
have been documented. ,
Marijuana, despite the fact it
is commonly classified as a hal- —
lucinogen, is not unique both

in its chemical and psycho-
_ logical effects produced. ‘Hal-

lucinations are notwa common

~ effect, but a symptom of over-
dose, as is the case with alcohol.

Unawareness and misinfor-
mation have been major hin-
drances in the legalization of
marijuana, according to Pitt
Professor Larry Laudan. ”

A professor in the history and
philosophy ” of science depart-
ment, Laudan taught the
“Nukes, Pot and Gays” course
last winter term to provide stu-
dents with a “means to evaluate

socially relevant issues from

both a moral and scientific
view.'’ , _ A
People are unaware when it
comes to the facts about the
effects of marijuana-—choosing
to believe nothing has been
documented-—when_ in fact

there are several scientific stud-
ies that find the effects of mari- A
juana are much less devastating

than alcohol,” said Laudan,
who is currently on sabbatical
doing research at the Virginia
Polytechhical Insititute. 0

Not only are people unaware
of the scientific studies, they are
alsojnfluenced by the myths
and misinformation of the past,
said Laudan.

Price: Free f

Oneof the sources of misin-
formation back in the 19305 was
the Federal Bureau of Narcot-

ics, which took over fromwhere _

sury Department left of after
the end of Prohibition i

According to Laudan, an all-

the Alcohol Unit of thek\Trea-

out campaign against mari-
juana was waged.

v“This agency was responsi-
ble for ‘grossly exaggerating
the potential danger of mari-
juana. despite the fact that an
organizationlike the American
Medical -Association publicly
opposed the federal anti-
marijuana law in 1937," Lau-
dan said. “Before that
marijuana had been grown

extensively for the manufactur-
ing of rope and there IS evidence
that it was also smoked back
then for both ‘medical and»
recreational purposes.”

legalization of the drug that in
1765 George Washington grew
at Mount Washington for both
its fiber and medical value and
that in 1935 was documented in

NORML, the National Organi-
zation to Reform Marijuana
Laws.

“We’re seeing more activity
now, on college campuses,”
Farnham said. “But overall, our
organization is ,made up pri-
marily of people in the 18-30
age group.” ,

NORML is an non-profit
consumer lobbyist organization
with a membership of about
10,000, Farnham said. It works
primarily with state legislators,
trying to convince them to»

! «reduce or eliminate marijuana

laws. \ v
Currently, Alaska has the
least stringent laws of all the
states, according -to Farnham.
Alaska is a progressive state
in terms of marijuana laws,”
Farnham said. “For possession
and cultivation of small‘

\amounts of marijuana for per- 0
- sonal use, there aren’t ‘ any

penalties." ’

Alaska's laws contrast greatly
with those of Nevada or Arizo-
na, where possession of small'
amounts of marij uanacan draw

year-long jail sentence.

Farnham said that NORML
is “at something of a standstill
legislatively.” Thirty-nine
states have moved to [reduce
penalties for possession of
small amounts of marijuana,
but it’s been four years since the
last state eased its laws.

NORML is attempting to
establish realistic legal models
to aid states in reforming mari-
juana laws, Farnham said.

Q Trustees Approve Early Incentive Retirement Plan

By LINDA MILLER

A retirement plan designed to
trim the number of faculty in
anticipation of declining eti-
rollm-ent was approved unarni-
notisly by the board of trustees
on W ednesdiiy.

The Faculty Early Retire-
ment Incentive Plan. which
will l)e put into effect for a five-
year period l)eginning July l,
offers a maximum incentive
payment of $25,000 a year for
those faculty memﬁbers age 62 or

‘ older with 25 years of service.

The plan represents the two-
year long deliberations of a
joint faculty *adminis_trative
committee and has the approval
of both the University Senate

(Iouncil and the administra-

tion.

Some 200 members of Pitt‘s
L200 lull-time tenured faculty
will l)e eligible for the plan that
is available to all lull-time
tenured faculty and administra-
tors with l0 or more years of
service and between 62 and 09
years of age. (2urrently, all
tenured faculty have the right to
remain in full employment
until the age of 70.

According . to Planning and
Budget Vice Chancellor john
Yeager, only 65 percent of the
laculty that retire early will be
replaced in order for the plan to
operate on a break-even basis.

Faculty opting for the plan
will continue to be covered

under Pitt's health and life
insurance plans. They will also
retain such benefits as lree titr-

tion for their children and“

spouses.

Yeager said that, faculty elect-
ing to particpate in the plan
mttst provide the university
with one year’s notification and
that the university has the
option to request that a faculty
member delay entry into the
plan for one year.

The plan. which is also
designed to foster and provide
intellectual renewal within the
university and to provide
increased opportunities for
younger faculty members,‘ will
be evaluated at the end of three

y(’{l TS.

I

The board also unanimously
approved a university proposal
to borrow 5-’)25,(l()() for the pur-
chase oi Tanglewood Manor
Apartrnents in Greensburg.

The apartments will be used
as a dormitory for H2 students
attending the Pitt regional cam-
pus. With a current enrollment
of l.2:')0 commu‘iing students,
the (lreensl)u.t‘g catnpus seeks to
develop student housing as a
means to recruit students
beyond the commuting dis-
tance in order to meet future
enrollment goals and “toenrich
the academic, social and cultur-
al interaction resulting from a
broader mix of students." .

Dutton said that the lending

Young Republicans Resign From SGB Task Forces

By LAURIE MACLEOD

A ‘petition denouncing student
aid cutbacks was endorsed at the
first meeting of the Student
Government Task Force for Finan-
cial Aid on Wednesday.

Organized by the Student
Government Board (SGB). the task
force is designed to look into finan-
cial aid for higher education and is
comprised of vot' , members from
every recogniz

 organization.

The petition, which asks Presi-

dent Reagan, Gov. Thornburgh

Pitt student

and legislators to "substantially
increase student funding," will be
presented at the Speakers‘ Forum
on March l9.

Debate arose over the endorse-
ment oi the ition when College
Young Rep icans president Joe
Aloe said the task force should be
educating the students and not ask-
ing for increases, considering the
state of the budget.

Aloe also said he thought that
the petition’s sig 'tures ,were
obtained under ' be pretenses
involving other political issues.

Progressive Student Network
representative George Cebullca

said that when he was obtaining
si‘ 2 tures. he emphasized only the
st an aid cuts. °
“I don't care if you're a Republi-
can, Democrat or Communist. we
are talking specifically about the
student aid cuts," said SGB "si-
dent and task force chairman ’ dd
DeLuca. i
College Young Republicans
representative Brett I-lynninen said
it‘s important to look at how and
where student aid is being allo-
cated and less concern should be
given to endorsing petitions. V g
When the petition w‘as endorsed
by the task force, Aloe said the Col’-

lege Young Republicans would
have to drop from the new
organization.

"My organization is far to the
right, and we can't sign anything
that goes against tts," Aloe said.

When polled, the majority of the
task force members said their 2 'or
concern wzis to increase st ~nt
aid.’ A

DeLuca said an outdoor rally on
the Cathedral of Learning lawn is a
possible event for the beginning of
April A

Cebullca said the dental students
have a well organized letter-

writit ‘ atnpaigti'dealitig with the
cuts a will be asked 'to have some
input at the next iask force
meeting.

Other student groups repres-
ented at the task force meeting were
the Nursing Student Organization,
College of Young Democrats,
lnterfraternity Cot "l, Pre-Law
Society, Americans Democratic
Action and the University of Pitts-
burgh Student Aid Committee. ‘

To be successful, you have to be

“It’s -a‘ program where you get to

The program is in its second year
of existence at Pitt and promises to

be around for a long time. In its
first year it had 75 participants and
this year there are 86 students
enrolled.

Designed for freshmen, the pro-
gram has three objectives: to help
students acquire a positive sense of
personal identity; to help them

understand leadership skills and
the basic principles of group
dynamics; and to provide oppor-
tunities to test the fundamental
concepts of leadership and group
dynamics by affiliation with exist-
ing student organizations on the
Pitt campus.

Interest is the only qualification
freshmen need to participate in‘ the
program.

“Any in-coming freshman can
participate so there is no unfair
edge to anyone,” said Giangarlo.
“There is an edge to those who do
though; they get specialized train-
ing and interaction with people."

The program is a free, non-credit
course that covers two semesters.
The course begins in September
and continues through early
March. To complete the course,

students must attend all 20 of the
two-hour sessions and join an
organization.

The sessions cover a variety of

subjects such as relationship build- ..

ing, communication skills, moti-
vation and_risk taking.

“The program is not judgmental
and focuses on the student as a per-
son,” said Giangarlo. “It’s
designed to allow each student to
grow and to give them an arena to
try things out in."

The program has been successful
so far. Many of the students who
got involved with organizations for
the course last year are still in
organizations this year. The organ-

izations include fraternities, sorori- - '

ties, the Mentor Program. The Pitt
News, Army ROTC and theStudio
Theatre.

Cheers

It is a typical Thursday night in any Oakland bar
between the hours of midnight and 2 a.m. The bars are
serving their last rounds for the students, non-students
and usual barflies who have made a weekly ritual of get-
ting plastered on Thursday night. Soon, they will all be
completely drunk, and soon they will start to wander the

V streets of Oakland. »

Some of them will stagger to their dormitories, apart-
ments, or cars and drive home, albeit slowly and carefully.

' Others will stagger to their cars, sit down behindithe .,

steering wheel and fall asleep before turning on the igni-
tion, and never go anywhere until they wake up the next
morning wondering where they are and where they have
been. Then there will be others who will stagger -to their
cars, fumble with their keys, and manage todrive. They
will drive somewhere, all right, but it won’t be home.

Those select few who don’t make it home that fateful
Thursday night join more than 200,000 other people in
similar circumstances who die each year in alcohol-related
accidents, according to a recent Pitt News Inside Story on
alcohol (“Alcohol and the Student,” March 10). And of the
ones who die who are between 16 and 24 years old, they
will add further to the claim that alcohol-related accidents
are the chief cause of deaths among college students.

The previous statistics could just be the result of some
scare-story perpetuated by so-called alcohol counselors
who get paid "for rnaking such claims. They could, but
they aren’t. They are very real and frightening statistics,
and Pitt of all places cannot clairn immunity to its share of
alcohol-related accidents. \ ’ ,

It would be hypocritical of a student newpaper, how-
ever, to advocate the complete prohibition of alcohol con-
sumption on Pitt’s campus, not to mention just plain
ridiciilous. In fact, prohibition in such areas as the dormi-
tories and fraternities would create more problems than it
would solve. ” .

About the only alternative to prohibition that would cut
down on the number of alcohol-related accidents is the
simple act of taking responsibility for one’s own actions

~ while 'drinking.We would be foolish to not realize thata
. good majority of Pitt students like to drink now and then,

such,as after finals, graduation or an important achieve-
ment. That same majority also gets legally drunk during
those times. But a lot of those people, whenthey recognize

the fact that they are drunk, have enough pride in both ‘V

themselves and their lives to be careful about what they are

doing. ~

Others, like the ones who drive their cars when they
shouldn't, obviously don’t have enough pride in them-
selves to realize the stupidity of their actions. Perhaps, as
part of an educational experience in realizing the value of
life, those persons ought. to be taken down to the city
morgue to visit a few of the people who were involved in
similar incidents. One look at a corpse is worth a week of
counseling. . i

We have no objections to persons who drink to escape
the pressures of daily life, to celebrate or to_just get drunk.
That’s what the stuffis there for, and it's anybody’s right

to do as they please with it. If getting drunk is the only way — ‘

they can have fun, then by all means go ahead.
What. we do object to are those persons foolish enough
not to know how to handle themselves in a responsible

, and mature manner when they drink. That includes

anyone who drives, maliciously destroys property or
abuses other persons who have the misfortune to get in the
vicinity of irresponsible drinkers.

All said, drinking can be fun, especially for college

students who live in an environment where alcohol is

Spending Has Inflationar

Dear Editor: ,
This letter is in response to Allen
Jones’ reply to Tim Kearney in the
March 5 edition of The Pitt News
(“Whatever Happened To Patrio-
tic Spirit?i”). Mr. Jones must be an
amazing person. He has succeeded,
where the leading economists in
this country have failed,.in coming
up with an economic program
that will solve the nation’s ills.
Give the military any amount of
money it desires to build any weap-
on or weapon system it desires and,
prestol—-The rate of inflation and
interest rates will drop, employ-
ment will rise and all Americans
will even have two cars in their
driveway again. “Happy days are
here again. . .  .
On a more serious note, how-
ever, our economic problems will

not be solved with simplistic solu-’

tions such as Allen Jones suggests.
Taking the time out to write a letter
shows sincerity in one’s beliefs, but
this program will, in all probabil-
ity, prove counter-productive.
Defense spending of this magni-

tude in such a short period of time’

has the potential for greater infla-
tion. Such a massive build-up
means hiring back‘ idle workers or
attracting workers from other
industries who will, then be
replaced by idle workers. All this
added income means more money
chasing the same amount of goods
,—-the assumption being that not
too many private citizens purchase
MX missiles or X-l Abram’s tanks.
One need only remember that man-
datory wage and price controls
were put into effect during World
War II just to prevent such an
occurrence, and that no such con-
trols were used during the Vietnam
War._ Considering. that deficit
spending will be used to finance
this military. build-up, just as it
was for Vietnam, the potential for
greater inflation -is present. Even

A the amount spent for defense is

similar—29 cents of every dollar by
l985 under the Reagan program
and $30 billion out of a 15 l 30 billion
budget in l967—68 just for Vietnam
(not including other‘ defense
expenditures). _

What's truly iiniaziiig about the
planned defense huilcl-up is that
it’s based on past rhetoric and
cliches. Many people in this conti-
try just refuse to look at cyideiice
such as Jeff Krossc tt1(‘l1ll()l)(‘(l in
his fine letter (i\l2lt‘(’ll  "Rcagan’s
‘Nice Guy‘ linagc Not Issue"). .-\iid
his points are only the beginning
of the ai‘guin<'nt that the more
inoderatc people in this country
have coiiccrniiig Soyict
tions——thc gist‘ l" ivliicli is that the
I'SSR is a (lclicn'si\‘e power‘ (lllll(‘ll
like lltt" t'.s.). 0‘

One cannot gauge in Mr. Jones
lettei'_t'he type of l)()ttll)(‘t‘ that he is
discussing. J but ‘if it is the ‘B-l

. J '*4iB()tnl)(‘1‘.cI'('l like to propose a (‘pies-' .‘
 »t—roii: r~,jIf{‘,,l\c\'-.'I.S« 1: seci.ii:iiy .lielj.)e.*tl~r;L  V - 

“..

ltll('ll-_ '

by spending $40 billion on a weap-
on that, according to many defense

analysts, will be obsolete within

five to (ten years after it comes on
line in 1986-87? The silly assump-
tion being ‘that, in building an
advanced bomber, one is concerned
with national security and not with
solving economic ills. . -c..-.

Lest we forget, though, the main
point behind Mr. Jones’ letter-—
our lack of patriotism. If patriot-
ism means not criticizing a $91
billion deficit, - budget cuts that,
especially after 1983-84, will hit
much more than “fat” in the social
programs of this country and a for-
eign policy right out of the l950’s,
then, no, I and many other people
in this country are not patriots. If,
hbwever, constructive Criticism is
permitted (I seem to recall it being
guaranteed according to a litt.le,
insignificant slip of paper known
as the Bill of‘Rights) as part of the
definition of patriotism then, yes, I
am patriotic—and to a great extent.
-Articles in The New York Times or
The Washington Post critical of
the president aren’t written out of
hate, but out of disagreement with
his policies. A

Mt‘. Jones writes, “the president
wants to reduce the loopholes and
corruption" in this country———why
not start with the Pentagon. Ilone

 

/

does not believe that the Pentagon
has it s troubles, then one need
only walk up to the fourth floor of
the Hillman Library and read the
April 27, 1981 edition of U.S. News

I and World Report. Keep in mind
‘ that this is not a Socialist workers"

weekly, but the most conservative
of the three major news magazines
in this country (Time and‘News-
week being the other two).

Mr. Jones also mentions sacrifi-
ces on the part of the citizenry of
this country. One’ would be hard-
pressed to find too many of the

wealthy in this nation hurt by Pres- J,

ident Reagan's economic progra,

The working poor and the middle
class are hit heavily by it, however.
Student aid is just one area. When
The Wall Street joumaltakes issue
with the cuts in student aid, one

-should at least begin to take issue

with some of the policies being
adopted.

In closing, I would like to add
that Mr. Jones’ definition of patri-
otism -is perverse, andif it ever
becomes the standard by which
patriotism is measured, the Bill of
Rights won’t be worth a damn
thing.

Pitt’s Mission: Slow Down Pepperdine

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

All the clamor overthe slow-
down doesn’t bother Pepperdine
Waves Coach Jim Harrick. The
slowdown tactics are the farthest
.».thing from Harrick’s mind. Go
ahead and introduce a shot clock in
college basketball-—Pepperdine
doesn’t care. They’d never use the
whole 30 seconds anyway.

  

That would be considered a.

slowdown by 20th-ranked Pepper-
dine’s standards.

‘ And you thought West Virginia
could run. Haven’t seen the Pep-
perdine Waves, have you? Pitt’s
Roy Chipmaniwill get a first hand
look tonight at 9 p.m. in Pullman,
Wash., in the first round of the
NCAA Championship- Tourna-
ment’s West Regional.

It’s in Pullman that Chipman
v".Vwill find out that life on the West

Coast isn’t that laidback. Pepper-

dine surely isn't. These guys moon-
light as track runners, or so it will
seem. Like five guys -on speed. Up
and down, up and down the court.
Patterned offense? Shoot’; we’re
here to shootithe basketball.

And, oh, how they can shoot.
The Pepperdine team is shooting
55 percent from the field.‘ Four of
their five starters score in double
figures every time they step on the
court, the most successful being
guard Boot Bond with an 18.4
point average. Backcourt mate
Dave Suttle chips in at a 17.1
points-per-game clip.

“People on the coast seem to
 think that the two form the best

tonight’s Eastern Regional
women’s gymnastics champion-

ships is about as easy as explaining
the intricate details of Reaganom- ,

ics to a two-year old child. Yes,

tonight’s’NCAA team competition

* will probably be the closesst, most

t-fisted battle the Eastern
region has ever witnessed.

The East’s six best teams will
assemble tonight at the Fitzgerald
Field House for this important
meetwhich will determine
national championship bids.

In recent years, Penn State has
been the overwhelming power-
house of the East, dominating
regionals almost effortlessly. How-
ever, this year the Penn State dy-_

backcourt out there,” Chipma_n~

noted fearfully.

That is something when you
consider that UCLA, Oregon State
and San Francisco are included in
t_hat category. Yes, these guys are
for real. 7 4

There’s more. Like twogfor-\

wards, Orlando Phillips and Bill
Sadler, who average 15.2 and 12.6
points per game respectively, and
along with center Scott McCotton,
form what may be the widest front-
court in college basketball.

“They have one of the heaviest
front lines in college basketball.
One of their kids goes (weighs)
about 230 (pounds), withlthe big-

gest rear end on the West Coast‘

according to one scouting report,”
Chipman said with a smile.

But who are these guys? They’re
against whom--St.
Mary’s girls’ school or DePaul?
The Pepperdine Waves are the
undisputed champions of the West
Coast Athletic Conference
(WCAC) with a perfect 14-0,league
record. Included in their confer-
ence is highly regarded San Fran-
cisco, whom the Waves beat twice
by scores of 104-95 and 106-100.

Bond, Suttle and Phillips were
named All-WCAC, while Harrick
was “Coach of the Year” and
Sadler was an honorable mention
all-league player. Pepperdine
avaerages a whopping 86 points a
game.

Plain and simple, the.Waves like
to fill it up.

to average a score of 144.26 this sea-
son. This excellent average makes
them the top seed in tonight’s team
competition portion of the two-day
meet. Saturday, gymnasts will
compete for individual honors.

‘ “Penn‘State has a really strong
second half (of a meet) , especially
in big meets like this one,” said
Donna Sanft, coach of the Lady
Panthers.

Most teams’ downfall is the bal-
ance beam, where scores are slashed
at any show of unsteadiness. But

up-tempo game,” Harrick said. He
then added, a bit defensively, “But
we can play different types of

,games. We have played slow‘-

down.”

A little more impressed? Have to
be, right? Don’t-rush to call your
bookie yet, though. These guys can

put the ball in the hoop, no ques-

tion. But take a look at their
defense; they don’t have one.

“If you believe the scouting
reports, we’re playing the No. 1
team in the nation. But they’re giv-
ing up 84 points a game, too,”
Chipman said in a tone laced with
optimism.

Give Pepperdine an outdoor
court, some rims and any old ball,
and nine times out of 10, they'll
win. Defense? Come on, the name
of the game is putting the ball in
the hoop.’

“I want to'see how they do‘

against a little pressure,” Chipman
casually retorted.

The pressure Chipman is talk-
ing about is, of course, the Pan-
thers’ tenacious 1-3-1 trap zone.
Put the brakes on that fastbreak,
because an intense trap is waiting
for you at halfcourt.

“We're going to slow them
down. I want to see how they react
to a trapping defense,” Chipman
said. ‘ _

It worked well against West Vir-
ginia. The Mountaineers, whose
propensity to run is well-known,

were severly slowed by the Pitt trap.

for Penn State, this highly difficult
event is one of their strong points.
Leading the Lady Lion team is
sophomore All-America Heidi
Anderson in the all-around.
“Penn State is scoring as much
on the beam as others do on vault
and floor,’.’ Sanft said. ‘
The second-seeded team,,with an
average of 141.13, is No. 16 Univer-

sity of New Hampshire. Earlier’

this sea-son the Pitt Lady Panthers,
currently ranked 11th, nationally,
defeated New Hampshire .in dual
competition. But, as Sanft noted,

” “We beat them early in the season,

improved.” New Hampshire will

Chipmagn’s Second Act?
Better Than Debut

B)/JOHNETTE HOWARD --

Two Eastern 8 champion-
ships, two NCAA tournament
berths and an error thinking are
the only basis for comparison of
this, basketball coach Roy
Chipman’s "second Pitt season
to his first. .

For, of the good doctor's two-

 year medicine act here at Pitt,
the latter performance has been
even more remarkable than the
debut. / 1.

Gone this season were seven
players from last year's 19-12
team, including four of five
starters, two eventual NBA draft
choices and an excess of that
valuable commodity called
“senior leadership.” If last
year’s NCAA tourney team had
a wealth of experience, the mass

. departure left this year's start-
ing team comparatively bereft
o.f such seasoning.

No matter—two freshmen,
one transfer player and a substi-
tute-turned-star later—an(l Roy’
Chipman has molded a team
that has already added one more
victory than last year's group.
as well as additional increments
of that which personal history
predicts of Chipman: success.

A career record of 264-105,
with a respectable 16-12 season

"’ the ‘worst among his previous

14, suggest it, if only as an echo. j_

His Pitt’-t’eam’s results verify ,

that, so far, winning is more
habit that happenstance for the
42-year-old coach, burying the
criticism that he had beefed up
his record at Lafayette and
Hartwick College against lesser
competition. A

Of all his seasons before,
Chipman admitted Tuesday
that the conclusion of this one,
Pitt’s first 20-win _season since
the 1973-74 NCAA tournament
team, has been the most
enjoyable.

“We didn’t have such great
expectations placed on us, and
from that standpoint it made it

A easier for us this year," Chip-

man said. “At times this season
we were frustrated—we
expected things to come sooner
than they did—but -the end so
far to this year has been as satis-
fying as any team 1’ve ever been
with. 4 C
After an impressive 8-2 start
that included wins over Ten-

nessee and Temple,’ the Pan-

thers skidded briefly to four
straight losses before rebound-
ing to win 12 of their 15 final
games. _

With aplomb and cockiness
that belies their youth, the Pan-
thers dispatched five of the
seven eventual NCAA or NIT
tournament teams they faced

~ The Pitt Panther men's volley-
ball team embarks on athree-day
gauntlet of competition this week-
end‘ that may determine whether
the team is a contender or pretender
for the Eastern regional crown it so
actively pursues.

The Panthers, beginning with
today’s match with perennially
nationally-ranked Rutgers-
Newark, continuing t5morrow

‘with the Eastern Collegiate Volley-

ball League mid-season tourna-

ment, and ending Sunday against
Army, should emerge -from ‘the
three-day_marathon with a firm
indication of whether they are to
shed the third-place Eastern rank-

I ing they've been-cloistered in for

.'l

the first four years of their varsity
existence at Pitt. ,
Several hard-fought matches
with the two traditional Eastern
powers, Rutgers-Newark and Penn
State, have instilled a great mea-
sure of confidence in the Panther
squad which, if last weekend’s two-.
game draw with Penn State is any
indication, is confidence that is
well-founded and supported by
ability. .
The Pitt team should benefit this
weekend by the return to form of

 freshman outside hitter Tony Zor-

tea, who had missed several weeks
with a knee in’j ury.

I’ Zortea, who is still playing him-
self back into top shape, will be a
welcome addition to the Pitt front
court, which is still without junior

nursing strained ligaments in his
‘ankle.
Though Friday's opponent,

Rutgers-Newark, has slipped to

Weekendschedule to Testspikers’ Worth

No. 2 in the East rankings behind
Penn State, the difference between
the two teams’ ability is minimal.
In addition to their crisp, textbook
play, Rutgers-Newark isalways an
interesting team to compete
against, with its contigent of ja-
Amaican leapers, its Russian immi-
grant coach, and the team ’s habit of
warming up before matches by spi-

warming up before matches by
spiking over-inflated volleyballs
that exaggerate the players‘ hitting
power.

Even without the doctored vol-
leyballs, the Scarlet Knights are an
imposing team, and a team the
Panthers have just missed upset-
ting the last two seasons. In one
match at Pitt last season, the

Panthers extended the contest to a ‘

fifth game, finally succumbing to
' Rutgers-Newark by three points in
the deciding game. . _
Saturday's ECVL tournament is
a mid-season indicator of what to
expect at the season’s end and at the
regional tournament, which will
ultimately decide which team
represents the East at the NCAA
National Championships in April.
Pitt, 2-1 this year in league com-
petition, will be hoping to improve
on its third-place finish of recent
years, as well as observe the play of
other teams in the league as a scout-

ing prelude for future matches,

Pitt's only loss in league play so far
this" season is to rival George
Mason, a team the Panther regular-
ly defeat.

Saturday, the Panthers face
another team they invariably
beat—Army-—which should be a

manned Cadets to‘ give‘ his
second-string players some court
time, and Sunday’s match should
be no exception, especially as the

welcome light touch after the
heavy weekend of match play.
Panther Coach Ray Reilly regu-
larly uses the matches with the out-

tiring weekend of play drags to an
end. ‘

Pitt has already defeated Army

Senior Panther swimmer Rick
Carter had a fitting end to his last
meet at Pitt at the Men’s NCAA
Eastern Regionals at Trees Hall
Pool last weekend. His sixth per-
sonal event, and last event of the
meet, the 400—yard freestyle relay,
set a new Eastern record as it quali-
fied for Nationals. r

The Pitt team of Ed LaNoue,
].D. McCrillis, and Carter powered

to a 3:01.99 finish, beating the

A  second—place West Virginia Moun-

N ngtztineer relay in the next lane by a
 solid seven-tenths of a second.

“It was a good pressure,” said
Coach Fred Lewis. “We knew there
was nothing left to swim after that
event, so they gave it all they had
left in them." Even after three days
of heavy swimming, all four
Panthers felt sure of themselves
and their ability to break the
3:02.01 national championship
meet cutoff time.

The event boiled down to each
Panther versus his respective
Mountaineer, as Pitt's relay went
in order of seniority: freshman
LaNoue, sophomore‘ McCrillis,
junior Zaleski, and senior Carter as

against WVU’s John Critchfield,
should have put the Panthers into
an early one-stroke lead. LaNoue

had beaten Critchfield’s 100-yard
freestyle time earlier that night in
finals. But Critchfield put up quite
a battle and touched even with
LaNoue. Both freshmen refused to

taineer Brian Day. Day's time ear-

lier in the individual 100-yard
freestyle was better than McCrillis’,
but it didn’t seem to faze McCrillis,
who was part of the Panther 400-
yard freestyle relay of Scott Shearer,
McCrillis, Zaleski, and Carter that
just missed national qualification
by one one-hundredth of a second
last year. That memory still sting-
ing, McCrillis went for broke this
year.

Despite having already swum
four events, McCrillis did the exact
national caliber split time that
Lewis was expecting. McCrilli‘s
and Day were even for three laps,
but his strong surge in the fourth
pulled McCrillis ahead as Pitt’s
third man, Zaleski got ready to
swim.

Like McCrillis, Zaleski was also’
‘ swimming his fifth event. But both

Panthers knew enough to save a
little of that National-qualifying
adrenalin for their last event.
Zaleski, like his three relay team-

mates, is an excellent 200-yard-

freestyle swimmer. In comparison,
only one of West Virginia's relay
swimmers swam the'200 the day
before. That was their anchorman,
Rick Hyser.

The longer-distance power
proved to Zaleski’s advantage. This
was the Panther’s most question-
able race of the four individual bat-
tles ‘within the relay, as the

Mountaineer he had to race, Tim
Pheland, had finished four places
ahead of Zaleski in the individual

100-yard freestyle earlier that -

evening.

Zaleski not only hung on, but
swam his second two laps faster
than his first two to touch out Phe-
land and give Carter an extra edge
over Hyser. Zaleski did not pull
away until his fourth lap. By then,
the entire Trees Pool crowd was on
their feet as were all the swimmers
on the-pool deck.

Carter had ‘been dreaming of
finally qualifying in the 400-yard

freestyle relay, and with a one;
stroke lead, the senior took off to set

the new Eastern record for Pitt.
Carter pulled ahead of Hyser on
every lap. Carter had won the 100-

yard freestyle earlier that evening ‘

for his third consecutive Eastern
title in the events.

After finishing his leg in the
relay, one look at all his teammates
who were rushing to congratulate
him and the relay team told Carter
that his dream had come true. They
were going to Milwaukee.

“The crowd went wild," said
McCrillis, “That was so great. We
were all so psyched. With a little bit
more rest before Nationals and
we’ll all be shooting for All-

The Pitt indoorsoccer club had a
smashing weekend, taking first

sisting solely of freshmen and
sophomores. _

“The young players did a real
fine job at Youngstown." said
Bemis. “The whole team did a
good job. It was a real team effort."

The Panther scoring was led by
freshmen Eric Hohman’s four
goals and Keith Reinhard’s three
goals, while Gary Gaido, Joe
Davin and Scott Norton each added
two, and sophomore Steve Dunn
scored one goal.

On Sunday, the Panthers con-
tinued their winning ways, captur-
ing all five matches to win the
tournament trophy in the Spirit
Collegiate Invitational.

The five-team field consisted of
Carnegie-Mellon University,
Slippery Rock, St. Vincent and

Grove (.‘ity. The teams played each
other once, with the top two teams
advancing to the championship
game. Pitt beat (EMU 1-0 to take
first place.

The Pitt scores came on two
goals each by junior Tom Trem-
pus, sophomore Nick Wilson, and
freshmen I)an Zemanski and Sher-

ilund “iSparky" Lucke. junior Eric

Tiedtke, freshman jim Steele and
Matt Engle each added one.

Junior goalie Jay Hirt recorded
shutouts in all five games, giving
him a season record of 17-1.

7 According to Bemis, the shut-
outs were due to the outstanding
play of Hirt and the Pitt defense.

“Hirt did a finejob in goal,” said
Bemis. “But our defense did a fine
job, also. They kept the pressure off

Pitt placed second in the tourna- ,-

Patemo blasts
A ggies. . . '

Penn State head football coach
joe Paterno took several shots at
the Texas A8cM administration
Wednesday for hiring former Pitt
Coach Jackie Sherrill for an esti-
mated $l.8 million.

In an article in the Post Gazette
yesterday, Paterrto said that Texas
A8cM’s search committee “have
determined that we’re going to
have a football team no matter
what. No matter how much it dis-
rupts our academic community.
No matter how much it disrupts
our image as an academic
institution.”

Paterno went on to praise his
own school, saying “that there’s
something beyond winning foot-
ball games, regardless of how
tough the competition is and how

Sports Briefs    

fiercely you want to win and how
determined you are.” '

Paterno, in town toreceive the

1981 Bobby Dodd Coach of the
Year award, donated the $1,000 he
received from the award to the
Penn State Renaissance Fund for
gifted students.

for his heavyweight title fight in
June against Gerry Cooney, he
should try ex-Pitt star Sam Clancy,

The 6-6, 235-pound power for-'

ward who now plays for the Bil-
lings Volcanoes of the Continental
Basketball Association took his
frustrations out on the league’s
leading scorer, Ronnie Valentine
of the Montana Golden Nuggets,
earlier this week. 1
Both men were fighting for a
rebound under the boards seconds
before the end of the third quarter
of their game . After the buzzer
sounded, both men exchanged

words while going to their respec-
tive benchesand then Clancy put ~

Valentine out with one punch.
Valentine suffered a broken
cheekbone and will be out of action
at least 10 days. If he needs surgery,
the former Old Dominion forward
will be out for a month. Clancy,
meanwhile, was slapped with a 21-
day suspension without pay, and a

$250 fine. The fine and penalty—-.
the most severe in league history—-- '

\

will cost Clancy $1375, or about'20 :

percent of his salary.

first NCAA qualification. For Car-
ter, it was his fourth year in a row as

= a Panther to go to Nationals.

“That relay made the meet," said
Carter-. “The last two years ,we
didn't send a relay. This year we
were the only one (in the East) to

, send‘any and we qualified two."

Carter will also anchor Pitt’s
400-yard medley relay of lid Ber-
gan, Sandy Pidgeon and Geoff
Emore.

“Both our teams (WVU and Pitt)
were going for National qualifica-
tion, so our strategy was for each of
us to beat our own Hoopie,” Carter
said.

WVU missed the cutoff by .68
second.

All four Panthers agree that

- there islstill tapering to .be done and

time to cut.
“We were all just a bit worn out

R from the day before swimming four

sets of 200-yard freestyle each,” said

Zaleski. “But we had confidence.’

We knew we could do it. I even
expected a better time than we did,

. but I guess with us all swimming

five and six events, I’ll have to wait
.until ‘Milwaukee to see our real

time.”
In Milkwaukee, Carter will l)e

 

the gas pedal a little faster. So, the
trap obviously has to be installed
just at the right time.

"We’ll come out in an extended
2-3 /.one and maybe a little pres-
sure. If they handle that well then

Nationals

the only swimmer from the free-
style relay entered in more than one
event, so Lewis will look for a drop
of about two seconds off their East-
ern time. .
“The key of keeping my mind
clear and relaxed was awful hard,"
said Zaleski. “With our whole team
going bananas on the side of the
pool I loved it though. It was a big
hype for Iny leg of the relay."

Although the Panthers finished ,

second to WVU in theoverall point
standings of the Ineet, the Panthers
are sending seven men to NCAA

Nationals compared to West Virgi-

nia's one qualifier.
Mountaineer Rick Hyser quali-

-fied in butter_fly.

The overall second-place finish
for the Panthers was attributable to
less team depth. If Pitt's times were
to be put against thoseof any other
tem, and the results tabulated like a
regualar -dual meet, Pitt would
have beaten all 15 teams repres-
ented at Easterns. Much of this top
strength was the four Panthers-
I.aNoue, McCrillis, Zaleski, and
Carter. These four have the ability
to put thellniversity of Pittsburgh
within the Top 20 ranks in the
United States with a good showing
at Nationals March 25-27;

have a little left for the second
round. We're looking forward to
playing Oregon State again; it's
important for our program. I'd like
to see how far we’ye come since
Deceinber."

Yes, that is nI_ore than a hint of
confidence. (lliipman, like his
Panthers. is riding a high prompt-
ed l)y the way his team has waltzed

through the last part of the season..

“We're feeling a little cocky right
now. This is not to say that we
won't go out there and fall on our
faces, but I don’t think we will."
Chipman remarked.

If the Panthers do fall flat on
their faces, it won't -matter to the

_“We were just looking for

was important, especially for
our younger players, to be

SCOT ' NORTON AND LISA 
FRIEDMAN STAR IN THE PITTS-

 

Quest For Fire may do for the
past what 200] and Star Wars
have done for the future-
influence and shape our percep-
tions of eras which, for obvious
reasons, cannot be examined
concretely.

Quest For Fire is an extrava-
gant, prehistoric science fan-
tasy; but it differs greatly from

"(:}1‘1‘sst films described in such

terms. Its extravagance, for
example, lies not in the ultra-
sophisticated world of special
effects, but rather, in its enor-
mous attention to detail and
accuracy. Instead of spectacular
displays of exploding planets,
there are scenes depicting B.C.
man living his life in normal
fashion: fighting off Cannibals,
romping with mates, hunting
for food, fornicating, and———
probably his most important
activity-—his search for and
maintenance of fire. It is the

fﬁelief by many anthropologists

that fire was the center of early
man's existence (it kept him
warmand dry, cooked his food,
gave him light, and could also
be used as a weapon) which
served as the inspiration for
Quest For Fire.

With a budget of some $12
million and an impressive list
of contributors (including
Anthony Burgess, who created
a special language used by the
tribesmen in the film, and
famed authorlbehavioral theor-

aist Deslhond Morris, whose

was designing body lan-
guage and gestures to be used
by the actors which,ar§,'theoret-
ically consistent with those
used by prehistoric man), one
might  expect an equally
impressive list of stars-——but, as
in other ways,Quest is not your
ordinary movie. Its "stars” are
relatively unknown, chosen not
just for their acting ability, but

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

 

E

also for their ability to with-
stand the physically harsh film-
ing conditions, which included
120 degree weather in Africa,
and freezing temperatures in
Canada.

familiar names, but to Quest's
director, jean-Jacques Annaud,
they were the perfect choices.

"These young players had to ‘

have faith in what they were
doing. Otherwise the terribly
rigorous locations, the appal-
ling discomfort-ts, the indigni-
ties, would not have seemed

worth the trouble. The choices

we made proved absolutely cor-
rect,” Annaud says enthusiasti-
cally. ‘

For being such a young direc-
tor (38), Annaud has had quite a
career (his Black And White In
Colour won an Academy Award
in 1978 for Best Foreign Pic-
ture), which may account for

his premature,‘ but becoming,

gray hair. A small-framed man,
he's filled with energy and
exuberance, gesturing and
smiling grandly as he talks
about Quest For Fire, his pet pro-
ject for "nearly four years.

"I could have done the same
old thing—-the same old tricks

the same dialogue, used well- I

known actors, had the usual
setting...but I wanted some-
thing different. Actors want to
transform, correct? So who

these?" he asks.

”But, really, I don't like to
make people suffer,” he says,
commenting on the film's
rigorous style which tested its
actor's endurance. ”I hate it! But
they suffered for good
reasons——-so it could be realis-
tic. They were half—naked—of
course—-but how could I avoid
it? If I put them in underwear,
they'd look ridiculous! Shoot

I've ever done. The physical
suffering was enormous-I
don’t know how many actors
could have suffered through it.
It took a few years off of my life
for sure,” says Everett McGill,
who plays Noah, a member of
the Ulam tribe, primitive
homosapiens whose existence
depends on the fire which is
preserved in a cage hidden in a
cave. «

McGill, whose ‘past credits
include a starring role in Union
City with popster Deborah
Harry, a major part in Broad-
way’s Dracula, and a substantial
part in Robert Redford’s con-
troversial Brubaker, is a quiet,
shy man whose severe-looking
face contradicts his true nature.’
Like the film's other actors,
McGill had to undergo the
same, often painful working
conditions, but he doesn't really
regret it.

Rae Dawn Chong (daughter
of comedian Tommy Chong of
Cheech and Chong) is the only
woman in Quest For Fire with a
major role. Only 21 years old,
she has the self-confidence of
someone much older, perhaps
due to her very independent
lifestyle (she lives in New York
and regularly commutes to
L.A.). Like McGill, she has no
regrets about making Quest.

’'I wouldn't ever do another

really satisfied with my charac-
ter,” she says.

”And,‘ hell, it could have been
so bad! How it turned out, well,

‘there are always things you

like how everything turned

text, she (her character) was
liberated, pretty hip, and
strong. Hopefully, it will make
more people want to see the
movie——the tits/buns...I like
the idea, it should help at the
box office!" she laughs.
Judging from Quest For Fire's

months and is doing record-

It is with a keen eye and at good
sense of humor that Agatha Chris-
tie's murder mysteries have been
translated successfully to the screen.

Directors. like Sidney Lumet (Murder_’

on the Orient Express) and Guy Hamilton
(The James Bond series) have just
what it takes to weave visually excit-

ing and witty films. Hamilton's Evil ‘

Under The Sun, thenewest of the ser-
ies, is no exception.

Once again, Peter Ustinov steals
the show as the infamous nonchalant

 elgain detective, Hercule Poirot. He
seems to have his characterization

down to the most minute of details;
the way Poirot swims, his eating hab-
its, and his double entendres. We are
perhaps not even watching a por-
trayal of Poirot...we are actually wit-
nessing the detective incarnate. I
suspect that Ustinov has had clair-
voyant sessions with Agatha Christie
herself, discussing the character at
length. It's uncanny.

The film features a variety of

extravagant characters, all of vifhom

Smith brings a stab of sarcasm to her

actress can do no wrong. Save for a '

dinner sequence where she is forced
to wear a gown that looks like
somene threw 1,000 wet ‘jujubies on
her (which actually only lightens her
performance). Miss Smith delivers a
performance which confirms her tal-
ent as one of today's finest. Diana
Rigg, appearing as the actress eve-
ryone has a motive for killing, is given
perhaps the best one—liners of the
film. Her appearance is brief, but
essentially bitchy. Roddy McDowell
plays a Noel Coward—like poof by the

‘name of Rex Brewstenwhose motive

for killing is over the release form
needed to publish Arlena Marshall's
(Rigg) biography. His performance is
like...ahhh...hmmm, well, Roddy
McDowell. Iames Mason, as debonair
as ever, and Sylvia Miles, sounding

continued from page seven

Through all this his thesis on British
repertory theatre was completed.
His first preview of the celebrity
world came with his role as a villian-
ous bigamist and blackmailer on the
soap opera Love of Life. That certainly

'had its interesting moments. "I

stopped at this Friendly’s Ice Cream
store once for another ice cream fix

you know, and this woman comes up
to m'e‘in the parking lot with her
handbag. BOP, right over my face;
‘how dare you treat your mother that
way!’ No preamble like ‘I watch your
show and I think you're terrible and
howjdare you’ just BOP. I thought
jeeze, somebody is watching too
much TV here." »

Reeve’s ability to put fame into
perspective, his general politeness

‘and basic respectability along with

his well-to-do persona (one senses
immediately that he is from a cultu-
rally expedient family) are character-
istic of many of todays’
successful actors. Perhaps our fasci-
nation with actors we could take
home to meet mom and dad is a by-
product of the conservative climate
of the country.

”I don't think 10 years ago anyone
could have made Superman because
the mood of the country would not
have sustained it. If you'd made Super-
man during the Nixon Whitehouse
and a guy comes out and says ‘I'm,

"something like a Brooklyneese Mer-

cedes McCambridge, play Myra &
Odell Gardener, a bigshot producing
couple from New York. They have
come to persuade Arlena into doing
their nextshow, at the same time
trying to get revenge for when she
left their last successful vehicle.

Other admirable performances are
given by Emily Hone, Denis Quilley,
and Nicholas Clay (Lancelot in Exca-
libur). Jane Burkin and Colin Blakely,
who previously have had only sup-
porting roles .in the other Christie
mysteries, now handle lead perfor-
mances with confidence.

Technically, the film lacks nothing. .

The settings are lush, the photo-
graphy crystal clear (with sharp edit-

ing during flashback sequences), and

the costumes are 1930's outlandish-
to-gaudy (but oh, so appropriate).
The screenwriting skills of Anthony
Shaffer (Sleuth) are far superior to
most current screenwriters. It is to
his snappy and unexpectant dialogue
that we owe the success of one of
Christie's less popular novels. To put
1
fighting for truth, justice and the
American way’ I don't think it would
have gone over as well as it does
today. It just seems to me though
that the media is far too quick to
identify everything. They aren't
comfortable until they pigeonhole
you. It seems that if anything
happens twice they call it a trend and
if two people look alike they call it a
movement. I don't know where I fit
in yet and I don't want to jump on any
bandwagon.”

This refusal to put himself into a
trend or movement is of course
understandable. After all, Superman.
will haunt him the rest of his life.
He's signed to play him again in
Superman Ill (this one’s with Richard
Pryor), a fact he seems perfectly
happy with. Reeve LIKES playing

the topping on the banana syrup (Poi-
rot's favorite drink), the score is by
Cole Porter. Somehow, ”I’ve Got You
Under My Skin,” ”You're the Top,”
and ”Night and Day” seem to~be the
perfect leitmotifs for this film, and
they are cleverly scored.

It would have been so much easier

i for me to write a bad review, as it

usually is, but the film does not merit

one. Evil Under The Sun is for those‘
- literate few who still like to go to

films that make you think. It's not

that it's a heavy film, but all the pieces V
are not given to you; as most films.

today leave nothing to the imagina-
tion. The task‘ of solving the crime
must be done by carefully watching
the screen and thinking of past
events at the same-time.

Don't bother asking, ”Harry, do
you think I could go to the bathroom
now and not miss anything?” The
obvious answer is: no—do every-
thing before you go in. And don't
forget the popcorjn—-this is one hell-
of—a—Saturday matinee. '

Superman, though he admits some-
times forgetting he's played him. ”It
was four years ago, you know, that
was a long time ago. I'm always asked
about the Superman image thing and
I really have to be patient when I'm
asked that because I don't know what
they want to hear.’

Whatever the public wants to hear,
Reeve seems to have his own answer,
and Deathtrap and The Fifth of luly are
just as much a part of it as Superman III
is. Sure, the success came quickly and
dramatically but Christopher Reeve
seems to be taking it in stride; what
else would you expect from a man
who played a blackmailing bigamist
as easily as he did the greatest of all
American heroes? Now that's
diversity.

    
  

  
    
 

    
 

When success comes as quickly and

r dramatically ‘as it came to Chris-

topher Reeve there is a temptation to
wait for what seems inevitable; a big,
loud crash. "We set up our heroes so
that we can knock them down," says
Reeve, and he should know. Coming
from seemingly nowhere to star as
the man of steel .in two of the biggest
movies of all time, he was a prime
target. But Reeve has an unusually
healthy attitude about the unhealthy
desire we have to knock our heroes,
be they fictional or real, from out of

: the sky.

I

"We live in a consumer society,’
notes Reeve, "we consume people the
same way we consume Kleenex or
Hagen Dazs ice cream. At first I
wanted everyone to like me. It was as
though I were running for student
council, so I trotted out on every talk
show I could find to sell that fact that
I wasn't Superman. But now I realize
that isn't necessary. You 'can't get
everyone to like you and you'll drive
yourself crazy trying to. Just do your
work as deeply as you can and get on
with your life."

But even "getting on with his work,
most notably with a six month stay
on Broadway as a double amputee,
homosexual, Vietnam Veteran, in
Lanford Wilson's critically acclaimed
Fifth of ]uIy left Reeve open to another
charge—now he was trying to
CHANGE HIS IMAGE!

"I don't try to play different parts

for the reasons people imagine. It's _

easy to think, "he's desperate to
change his image,’ but that's not the
case because I'm very proud of hav-
ing played Superman. It could have
been a disaster for everyone
involved, but I think both movies
were well done, I think I played the

’ part well and it's something I look

back on with a real sense of achieve-

ment- When I try to play different I

B-

because the only way to be happy is
to always set new challenges for
yourself.” '

This healthy attitude probably
comes from the fact that Reeve has
been acting since he was nine years

-old--so much for overnight success.
~ "The public sees my career as before

Su erman and after Su erman, but I see

 

.-  12/

to be an actor or an entertainer. An
entertainer is somebody who you pay
to watch repeat himself, an actor is
somebody who you look forward to
seeing in a new incarnation."
Reeve's latest incarnation is Clif-
ford Anderson, a seemingly inno-
cent, eager beaver student in

it as, and this is a silly image, but I see
it as a train track. Superman was one
station, admittedly it was Grand
Central, but nevertheless it was one
stop along the way. You look for
diversity, but you don't thumb your
nose at the public and say, ‘look at
me, I'm being different.’

"I’ve always wanted to be a per-
former who looks for diversity, not
someone who cashes in on some-
thing. You have to decide if you want

sion of the longest running comedy
thriller in Broadway history. The
role will surprise those who have
only seen Reeve as Superman
because Clifford Anderson is not
quite what he seems. The role calls
for a constantly shifting personality;
one minute he's sweet and kind, the
next he's menacing and aggressive,
and Reeve handles it all masterfully.

"I reniember going to see the play

in the first three months of its run
and just being scared out of my wits.
I'm not good with thrillers, I miss
most of the action because I'm under
my seat. But I instantly liked the fact
that Deathtrap wasn't a graphic, vio-
lent, unremitting horror. It's a classy
melodrama which tries to balance

laughsand thrills. That's an interest- . 

 

ing challenge; trying to get the

ing opposite Katherine Hepburn in A

Matter of Gravity on Broadway may
surprise some, though it really
shouldn't. Reeve is a classically
trained actor (he graduated from Jul-
liard) whose good (almost too good)
looks fit into the classic matinee idol
mold perfectly.

I _There is still a sse of awe in

MICHAEL CAINE AND CHRISTOPHER REEVE IN

those matinee idol looks though.

when he talks about the acting pro-
fession; a delightful star struck qual-
ity that you don't see too often in

1 stars. This is particularly obvious

when he talks about Katherine Hep-
burn. "I think she's a great actress!

She's a marvelous blend of Katherine-

Hepburn and the character every-
time she performs. That really fasci-
na‘tes me.

"What I learned from her was sim-

      
 

plicity. Before I worked with her I I

looked on acting as a way of escaping
into a character to protect myself.
Hepburn taught me the opposite
approach. You, the person you really
are, since you're three dimensional
and you already exist, are more inter-
esting than a piece of fiction, which
however brilliant is still imaginary.
So don't try to pretend you're lost in
the character and be completely
somebody else. You still look basi-
cally like you, your whole personal-
ity is up there, so use it to the extent

possible, then change when neces- -

sary to adapt to the character."
Working with Hepburn, who adds
a flair for ‘the dramatic to everything
she does, was for Reeve the highlight
of his career. "I came in to read for
the play, expecting just the stage
manager to be there and she herself
is sitting in the front row. So I read
for her and she said ‘you're going to
be my grandson’ (his imitation of
Hepburn is right on the mark).

WOW! I mean there's still a whole in .
the ceiling where I went through."

And even though I was dreadful in
the play, I was petrified, I just froze
like a wooden indian, I had somehow
gotten an endorsement that I was
OK. After that anything seemed pos-
sible, and I owe that to her. You can't
get a job without self confidence, so.

where does it come from? You need

that endorsement." I
Reeve’s interest in acting goes way

back. Although he doesn't come from ‘

an acting family (his mother isa
reporter and his father is a
professor—Reeve notes the last film‘
his dad saw was Casablanca) he has
been working professionally since he

was nine years old. While earning his ,

master's degree he worked at Lon-

”don’s Old Vic as a "dogsbody” and the

legendary Comedie Francaise, where
he was also a glorified errand boy.

C CMU Field House

March 4, 1982

By IOHN RUSNAK

On their pint-size tour of less
than a dozen cities, Cheap Trick
proved that they can still put on
a good show, both musically and
visually, in CMU’s fieldhouse of
all places. Gyms are for jocks,
not for rock concerts. The
acoustics were horrible to say
the least; only once in a while
could a word be understood.
The P.A. was probably very
good but the metallic gymna-

sium made everything and any-
thing sound like vibrations on a
clutter of garbage cans. Even
the miserable rain couldn't
dampen the sound. Definitely
not worth the eight bucks gen-
eral admission.

The intimate hall was half-
filled but held a huge crowd con-
sidering the localized pro-
motion. The audience was
plagued with bubble-gum-
chewing adolescdnts wearing
Rush and Jackson Browne T-
shirts. This was not going to be
fun. But Cheap Trick proved
that preconception wrong.
They played like they didn't give

 

a damn about the rain, or the
hall or Reagonomics.

ﬁyiitarist Rick Nielsen pro-
clai ed at the start that they
were going to play rock-n-roll
and ”not that shit that you've
been listening to.” The crowd
roared and the band proceeded
with ”Dream Police,” ‘'1 Know
What I Want," "Gonna Raise
Hell” and the whole string of
their hits, along with a preview
of their new album due out next
month.

With another new bassist,

_ John Blant, who did a fine job on

”Gonna Raise Hell" and the new
songs, ”Losing Control" and

”Saturday at Midnight," Cheap
Trick brought back the fun
that's been missing lately with
all these pretensious, serious,
new wave bands. Robin Zander
screamed for most of the show‘
while Nielson acted as crazy as
ever with his five-in-one guitar.

The two encores included, ’’I
Want You to Want Me” and
”Surrender" in which lead sin-
ger, Zander and Nielson kicked
out Kiss records into the crowd,
who in turn tore them to
shreads. Too bad the acoustics
screwed up the night 'cause the
house WAS rorlcin'.

SICKNESS

Skibo Ballroom

February 28, 1982

By FRANK DIGIACOM0

It's not the right night for a
concert tonight. The walk to
Skibo is quiet, listless and laced
with beer-toting concert—goers.
Inside, the atmosphere is even
more glazed—over. Everybody

‘seems to be trying to figure out
where to put their hands. Front
pockets'll do fine until the circu-
lation goes...”Look Ma, no
blood..." l try to walk around so l
don't have to talk to anyone. l
wish the damn show would
start.

Carsickness is on first. Lately,
this group has been nothing but
hot. Their gig two days before
at the Stanley and tonight's
show, the group's 200th, are
incredibly tight. The band's
characteristic layering of subtle
rhythms is scintillating and by
the time ”For You" is
announced the multitudes are
dancing. The highlight of Car-
sickness' set though is ”Runa-
way Soldier"—-it's a runaway
winner. The vital signs have
returned..."Look Ma, new
blood..."

The intermission is remarka-
bly short, but long enough for
many of the more intrepid
females: to batter their way up
front and stake their claim for a
glimpse of this boyish e~<—l)oll.
The lights go down and
lohansen rum band take the
stage with their best New York
strut‘. lohavnsen, dressed ‘in tur-

quoise cords and a non—discript
shirt looks like a Murjani
poster-child while his ”blow-
dried" band of sessionists

resembles some sort of a Vidal '

Sassoon wet-dream. Nonethe-
less, these guys are no slouches
as they begin to toy with a
snazzy guitar run that develops
into the first song. From that
moment on it would be a non-

stop set of fast-paced rock—n- *

roll.

Probably one of the best
aspects of tonight's show is that
Vlohansen doesn't have any new
album to push. Consequently,
the set consists largely of songs
from his first album; one NY
Dolls’ song; and a large amount
of cover material including the
Four Tops’ ”l'll Be There," Bon-
nie Tyler's "lt's A Heartache,"
and "Stranded ln The lungle."
The Dolls; song is "Personality
Crisis" and seems to be an
obvious favorite among the
crowd. Other faves include
"Donna," ”Build Me Up Butter-
cup," and the lohansen staple,
"Funky But Chic."

Although the concert is
enjoyed by most, the female sec-
tor of the audience is having the
best time ogling this domestic
version of a young Mick Iagger.
Although lohansen doesn't
exude the blatant sexuality that
lagger does, he nonetheless has
the stuff that little girls’ dreams
are made of-- especially the
ones that were here tonight.
The women couldn't keep their
hands off of lohansen-—-some

OUTLAWS  

O'UTLAWSlALEX BEVAN
February 25, 1982
Syria Mosque‘

By GEORGE HOLZER

The Outlaws are one of Pitts-

burgh's most consistent concert “

draws; but for some reason,
when the P.P.C. recently
brought them to town they
couldn't even sell out the
Mosque.

Alex Bevan was a poor, make
that terrible, choice for an open-
ing act: an up-and-coming act,
or even a local southern rock
band would have been a much
better choice. Bevan was met
coldly by a near-‘empty house,

and the few people in the

audience rudely talked between
his songs. A lack-lustre show
could have been his downfall.
The standing (acoustic) bass
solo was one of the few things
Bevan’s band did that caught
the audience's attention. One
thing about Bevan —he really
seemed to like what he did; too
bad not very many other people

 

did.
The stage set-up for the fea-

ture act was swift, and soon the _

Outlaws were on stage. Much
to the crowd's surprise was the
absence of original member
Billy Jones (guitarist/vocalist).
But the four remaining Out-
laws (guitarist/vocalist and last
remaining original member
Hughie Thomasson, guitarist
lvocalist. Freddie‘ Salem,

‘drummer David ‘Dix, and bass

player -Rick ;Cua) made_the
crowd forget Jones With their
fire and energy.

The ten song set included two
from the Ghost Riders album,
"Devil's Road" and ”Angels
Hide,” featuring fine harmoniz-
ing by the three vocalists. Also
included were four old tunes,
"Hurry Sundown,” "You Are
The Show," ”There Goes
Another Love Song," plus the
always-expected, always-
delivered "Green Grass And
High Tides." The other four
songs were from the as-of-yet
unreleased album Los Hombres
Mala (release date March 17).

The titles of these cuts are
"Don't Stop," "Easy Does It,"-
with Rick on lead vocals, ”Fox-
tail Lilly," and "Good-Bye."

. The one-song encore, "Ghost
Riders (In The Sky)” was com-
plimented by dry—ice fog which
poured onto the stage. This is
the only special effectthe Out-
laws use in concert, but this is
not to say that there is nothing
to watch during the show.
Hughie, Freddie, and Rick fre-
quently got together in pairs to
do some guitar jamming and

feuding, The show was com-
plete to both the visual and
audio senses. L

The concert was, in one word,
GREAT. The P.P.C. couldn't
have done anymore (O.K.,
maybe Bevan could have been
replaced), and the crowd of just
over 1,600 seemed satisfied.
Finding -blame for the low
attendance is not my job; all I
know is there aren't many
chances to see a band of the
Outlaws’ calibre for‘ the low
price tag of five bucks.

By THE CAN ADIANS

Pittsburgh's self-proclaimed
progressive-rock community
beware: this review has been
compiled by the less-than-
experienced. Theincompetents
assigned are’ the newest
members of Showmse's crack
crew of rock reporters. These
men have never been in Pitts-
burgh, never seen the Silencers,
and don't. even wear leather
jackets. They are imports. To
them the Electric Banana
sounds like cheap thrills for
lonely women. Remember, you
have been warned. Showmsv can
not be held responsible for
insulted intellects or bruised
egos.

Like, good day.‘

How's it goin eh?

The topic of this review is, like,
two things; us and this band we
went to see.

First off, us. Like, o.k., we did
this album.

Yeah, so, like, by the album, but
don't go around callin' your fra-

. .,.-....... .ternit-y- bro-thers-"hey, hoser:"4 ~
  (O.K., plagerism, now our

 

second topic; The Silencers,
good band, eh?

Yeah, so, like, now that we're
rock-reporters...

Which was, like,my idea to be.
Ah, take off!

So, like, we went to the concert
and it was raining so we got one
large soaker. g

And like the 7-11 had only New-
port Lights and no beers.
Yeah, and, like, we get to the
concert and there's cops. O.K..7
So, like, first no Newports, no
beers, and now they say the
Coleman's not allowed.

But it was,like, a good show
anyway, even if we were like,
dry.

Frank, the singer, he calls every-
one a name that rhymes with
"searsucker" and, like, is the
lower 48's version of hoser.
They did "Lets Spend The Night
Together," beauty, eh?

Which, for all you hosers, is a
Stones’ song, who we opened
for in Toronto.

Ah take off! We didn't even get
tickets.

E  --O.K»., so, like, they did "Head
0" Collision" WW? .l“.,m5‘*’..‘?.lfl";..‘.._-..,,  

ing with a few too many of your

favorites consumed.

Then they played two new
T songs, "Bad Boy Reputation"

and ”Don't Hurt Me So Bad,"

good songs eh?

Yeah, like, "heavy airplay,"

"with a bullet", ”could go

bronze." That's like, album talk

from an expert in the field.

Expert, eh? Like it's platinum as

in blonde, what a hoser!

Like O.K.,”Angel of Mercy” was

' next, like, it was fairly good, but

long. .

Yeah, like the drummer, who
they call "Bird," looks Canadian
and afterwards he gave us beers
so we're going to get him for our
next album.

Nex came ”Peter Gunne
Theme,"like, beauty again, eh?
Yeah, beauty, so like, that'll be
on our next album,too!

So, like, we gotta skip the next

part 'cause, like, we stepped out .

for some smokes and some air;
like, our toques were dripping
wet and our flannels were
soaked, too. V

Yeah, so likegwe came back in
and heard this song ’*[_’m A

 

Hog."

Which is, like about those peo-
ple in the donut shop who like
get a Sunday paper and about
three» dozen of the cake donuts
and nothing to wash them
down.’ .

So the band walked off stage
and the crowd started again
with the lower 48's version of
hoser.

Yeah, so it went like this in Can-
adian, "Hoser you Frank! I-loser
you Frank!" G

So that's our review for today»,

good day.

Yeah, like, good day, and, oh, we
got the Coleman back and drove
all night looking for Canadian
beer.

Yeah, and like, hoser here, we're
driving and the cops say we

OH!

YES IT'S YOU LADY

Tamla/Motown

’ Yes it's you who can do

The same old things
And make me feel good
every time

———"Yes It's You Lady"

Words couldn't be said any
better to describe someone who
does it best. That someone is
William "Smokey" Robinson
and what he does best is sing
love songs that melt us all into
romantics.

Smokey's -latest, Yes It's You
Lady, reminds us that, yes, some
things can still be counted upon

‘to deliver. There isn't even the
slightest sense of "reaching out"
on Yes It’: You Lady, but it cap-
tures such a warm feeling that

Robinson commands his vgice
as never before. Yes It's You Lady's
best cuts possess the same rich

texture achieved by four-part
harmony groups like The
Whispers. "Tell Me Tomor-
row,” which broke out as the
first single, manages to both
glide out onto the dance floor
and step out onto the street as
Robinson's vocals are glazed
over kinetic rhythms. The title
track and "Old Fashion Love"
follow, sticking more to the bal-
lad formula but remaining solid.

Side two plays a little more
erratically. "The Only Game In
Town" attempts a departure
into more up—beat, funkier
ground and suffers accordingly.
"International Baby" drowns in
its own sappiness: No one makes

Honolulu/Lilce I know you do/ Rhode

Island to San Diego/ They envy, me

'cause they lcnow./ Robinson, how-
ever, recovers in style with
"Merry—Go—Ride" and "I'll Try
Something New," the album's
two best ballads.

Yes It's You Lady breaks no new
ground but a smoother collec-
tion of. love songs will be hard to
find and a finer voice to sing
them may be generations in
coming 'cause, "Dad, it's still
Smokey!"

P NON-STOP EROTIC CABA-

' RET
Soft Cell

- Sire

Quite simply, Non-Stop Erotic

Cabaret delivers exactly what its
title promises and then some.
With so many electro.-‘plop bands
dominating today's (or is it just
this week's .7) music scene, it
would be easy to lump Soft Cell
in with thatgroup and watch
them” disappear quickly. But
don't bet on it. If Non-Stop is
indicative of future efforts,
chances are when all those
other bloodless bands fade into
the next trend, Soft Cell will
still be around. I

Non-Stop is" very unusual in
that it not only provides e-n—t—e-

‘ r—t—a-i-n—m—e—n-t, but enter-

   

tainment with substance. The
music is sometimes whimsical
and unobtrusive, often loud and
commanding, but always excit-
ing, as is the writing, which is
clever, witty and usually-ironic;
Marc Almond, vocalist and lyri-

cist, teases us through so.ng I

after song about sex (titles
include "Sex Dwarf,” "Seedy
Films," and "Frustration") like a
charming but perverted cabaret
singer. Many of the numbers,
especially "Secret Life" and "Say

Hello, Wave Goodbye/actually ‘

sound like something out of Bob
Fosse's Cabaret, with Almond in
the Joel Gray role. In fact, most
of Non-Stop is done in such a toe-
tapping, stagey manner that it
probably would be great if it
were adapted for the stage.
But don't get the impression
that it's too avant—garde to be

accessible; Non—Stop has been at
the top of several countries’
music" charts and has spawned
no less than three hits thus far
("Tainted Love,"_ "Bedsitter,"
and "Say Hello, Wave Good-
bye”). So now it's America's
turn. Will Soft Cell prove the
breakthrough in the U.S. for the
glut of electro artists who keep
knocking but get no answer
here? Truth, justice, and all that
aside, if there's any real justice,
they will.

LAST SAFE PLACE
Le Roux ‘
RCA

SPIES OF LIFE
Player
RCA

RCA's long—standing reputa-
tion as a l\/[OR/easy—rocking
record company has been
extended by the signing of two
acts with solid pop histories.
Both Player and Le Roux have
recently released their RCA
debuts and, although there are
differences, some similarities
can be found on these discs and
between the groups.

Similarity No.1: Both albums
were produced with the pop
audience in mind. Le Roux's
"Last Safe Place” (the single) is
climbing the charts and is in reg—
ular play rotation on 96KX.
Player's album has yet to spawn
a hit, but several songs have
Top 40 potential. Nothing like
their mega—hit "Baby Come
Back," though. The songs on
both albums‘ are well written,
accessible, catchy, and produced
to a high—gloss finish.

Similarity No. 2: This is the
fourth album for both bands;
therefore, experience has
helped them work out the bugs.
There are few, if any, flaws on
the albums.

Similarity No.3: (This one is
(most important.) Both albums
are FUN. They even make the

pain and suffering of heartache
sound like it has a sugar coating.

Last Safe Place is a little harder
driving than the Player album,
but is still not the power—pop
vein. Best cuts are the title cut,
"Addicted," and "You. Know
How Those Boys Are."

Player's Spies Of Life has more
variety than Le Roux's disc.
Songs range from slow ballads
to mild rockers. Top picks are "If
Looks Could Kill" and "It Only
Hurts When I Breathe."

Both albums are highly
recommended to pop/easy-
rocking fans. It looks as if RCA
signed up a couple more
winners.

ANYONE CAN SEE
Irene Cara
Network

Does anyone have any taffy I
could chew on? I just heard the
new Irene Cara album, Anyone
Can See and I have this URGE to

_ overdose on something sickningly '

sweet, like cotton candy, or fudge,
or maybe just plain old sugar
cubes.

Fame is not the root of this
album, even though every song
sounds like a pale imitation of it,
The Electric Company is. Cara
starred in that show for a couple of
years and the cloying "Let's learn
about something through music"
quality of it sticks to every song.

Irene Cara has everything it
takes to be a star—a good voice, a
pretty face, and the public's atten-
tion (Fame, Fame, Fame) but she
doesn't have a producer (this limp
effort was done by Ron Dante)
who prevents her preciousness
from overwhelming her. So we
get her cute voice singing cute
songs, with cute arrangements.
This record should besold in
candy stores only.

ALDO NOVA
Aldo Nova
Portrait

Fittingly enough, the opening
cut to this album is titled "Fan-
tasy" after all, this album is a
fantasy created by the Italian-
Canadian, Aldo Nova.

M /lldo Nova is the perfect defini-
Ltion of power-pop short, simple
songs, riveting guitar runs,
high-speed drumming, and
powerful vocals. The only trou-
ble with this is that nothing
really new is offered; bands
such as April Wine have been
doing the same thing for a
while, a long while. Aldo does
have a few things going for him;
he is multi-talented (he plays all
the instruments except drums
and handles the vocals as well),
and he writes all of his own
material. Favorite cuts include
, ”Fantasy," "Too Late," and

 ”Can't Stop Lovin’ You."

\

Aldo Nova's fantasy has
become reality (cliche I know,
but true), and it is worth a
listen.

Only three songs stand out as
passable: "The Things That

they drone out the Ramones

Want Me." The rest is back-
ground party muzak, although
the entire disc sounds great on a
good stereo. The music is so list-
enable, yet weak, that a copy
should be bought for your dad

took as much effort in the music
as they did in packaging and
sleeve design, this record would
be a feast for the ears.

SPEAK AND SPELL
Depeche Mode
Sire
' ’ A How good can a debut album
I'_}/ be with a cover depicting a
goose entrapped in a cellophane

bag? Well, you might be
surprised! .
Speak and Spell, the debut

album by Depeche Mode,
reveals some hot keyboard tal-
ent arranged in a zany yet lofty
fashion. Mixed with soft, pol-
ished vocals, the keyboards cap-
tivate and enfold the mind's
senses, providing an escape
from the complexities of every
day life. Many of the songs are
dance-oriented, using backbeats
in a consistent yet subtle style
unlike the pulsating beats of
disco that pound the brain in
every direction.

The group is made up of four
musicians with Vince Clark des-
tined as chief songwriter. How-
ever, Clark has recently left the
group after becoming intolerant
of all the touring that came in
the wake of the group's success.
The other three members,
David Gahan, Andy Fletcher
and Martin Gore will carry on.

The album hit America with
the single "I Just Can't Get
Enough." The song is a strange
array of Jamaican-style drum-
beats coinciding with diverse
and creative keyboard work.
The vocals are reminiscent of a
barbershop quartet, clearly deli-
neating the bass, mid-range and
soprano parts. The technique,
however, is unique to _ts_song,

 

   

whereby the other
involve only one vocalist.
All in all, I would say the
album is worth adding to your
record collection. It's quite an
intriguing composition of melo—
dies and words and is truly a
pleasant break from the average
commercial rock repeatedly
played on Pittsburgh stations.

HEART ON A WALL
Iimmy Destri
Chrysalis

songs

If there is one group that has
been at the crux of the musical
and cultural shifts (however
slight they might have been) of
the past few years, it would be
Blondie. Argue their ingenuity
or loyalties or talent, but
they've managed to successfully
portray "moderness" to a mass
which is increasingly bent on a
rear-view mirror approach to
their music.

Out of this, Jimmy Destri
emerges with the band's second
solo effort, Heart On A Wall.
Maybe the album's best descrip-
tion and finest compliment
would be to call it a musical
director's enigma: this is album-
making untouched by formulas.

The first cut, "Bad Dreams,"
hits on a Bowie-like sound that *
re-appears throughout the
album. "Don’t Look Back"
stands out as the best of the
album's power-pop numbers in
a style easily likened to Donnie
Iris. ”Living In Your Heart"
reveals some of Lennon's
melodical influences as its
heavily—synthesized arrange-
ment bops along to Clem
Burke's up-front percussion.

Destri's vocal roars dominate
much of the album, the only_'
exception being ”The King Of
Steam" which allows the band
to come front and center.
Deborah Harry lends a vocal
tnack to "Little Metal
Drummer;” a far out collection
of Burke's rhythms and Deb-
bie's coo—coo-coos. If only Des-
tri would have seen it fit to
include a lyric sheet, the integ-
rity of the words on this
musically—rich album could have
been discovered.

/l Hands-On Interview With Fingerprintz

 

By STEVEN HORWITZ

"Modern life is filled with sex
and violence,” expounds Jimme
O'Neill’, leader and songwriter
o_f Fingerprintz.

Fingerprintz, a band born
four years ago in London, Eng-
land, has recently added a third
album to their repertoire
entitled Beat Noir. The album is,
as Iimme describes it, ”basically
dance music with the songs
being stories within them-
selves.”

While in Pittsburgh in Febru-
ary, I had the opportunity to
interview Iimme before the
show.

SHOWCASE: Where do the band-

members originate from?

‘ IIMME: ”The band comes from

various countries—— one is from
Liverpool, another is from Cov-
entry, Bogdan is Polish, and
John and I are Scottish, but the
band is based in London."
SHOWCASE: Where are you popu-
lar now?

IIMME: ”There is a big demand
for us in Canada and New York
because the audiences are more
dance—oriented."

SHOWCASE: How would you des-
cribe the first two albums?

IIMME: ”The first album con-
sists of various pop and punk
songs while the second, Distin-
guishing Marks, is directed solely
toward pop songs. The second
album was inspired by Alfred
Hitchcock whereas the songs
were meant to be suspenseful-
type songs reflecting on what's
happening today between peo-

ple and their relationships.”

SHOWCASE: (After hearing this, I
thought I had come upon a clue.) Where
do your ideas for your music comefrom?
IIMME: ”A lot of song material
comes from news reports and
newspapers. Anger inspires -the
band to go on because the world
sucks. The songs, however, are
only meant to point out the
problems of modern society not

‘tW¥&K%~"\*’~\$.'\§2.‘x\\\~i~\m\\\mze. "

to influence and inspire rebel-
lious activities.”
SHOWCASE: What about the new
album Beat Noir, what image are
-‘you trying to portray with the album?
IIMME: "The title refers to a
certain type of black and white
films, during the 1940's. The
films were cynical, stark films
that depicted corruption in high
places, the mafia, etc. The films

I7

I  ré 

fi:f’iYél_i‘e';: beiieve 

   Rega_rdiesswhett’-her the summit 

 

were meant to be entertaining,
yet say something. We are try-
ing to do much of the same
thing——writing about the
underworld atmosphere below
the social level and making com-
ments about it."
SIIOWCASE: This is all very inter-
esting; I'm wondering whetherthe back
cover of Beat Noir means anything
and what's in theglass. (The back cover
depicts the band members intently gaz- ,
ing at ]i_mme who is sitting in the mid— I.
dle of them reaching for a glassllg’
half—full being held by the drummer of
the band. They are all wearing dark
40's clothing and/there is an old fan
sitting on a table in the background.)
IIMME: (laughs) .”The picture is
an interrogation scene from a
typical 40's flick. The glass is
filled with nothing but water.
The glass serves as an object
that I want, but can't have until I
provide them with answers.”
SHOWCASE: ”Beat Escape" (from
Beat Noir) is a good dance song but I
found it difficult to hear the words. . A
IIMME: (snickers) ”Yeah, someéaw
times.we want the beat to stand
out but it went too far on this
song. It talks about escaping to
the dance floor to get away from
the misery of life. You know:
Riot heart/and a riot street/ana' a riot
blood/and a riot beat."

The Fingerprintz’s show at
the Decade surely proved these
statements. The crowd was
electrified with the music—¥
arms swang, legs jumped, and
hearts thumped. A riot dance, a _
riot scene, and, most of all, a riot
beat. '
