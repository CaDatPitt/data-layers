Famous English Actor

Set for Review Series

By LYNN SCHWARTZ ~

Sir Cedric Hardwicke, considered by. many as one of
the world’s most versatile and experienced English actors,
will discuss “A Victorian in Orbit” in the Fine Books Room
of the Book Center Thursday at.3 p.m.l _

Hardwicke’s appearance on campus coincides with the

Pittsburgh, Performance of “A Majority of‘ One” in which

he co-stars with Gertrude Berg at‘? .

T Karen Tuttle

the Nixon. K
“A Victorian in Orbit” con-
tains Hardwicke’s theatrical

memoirs. which he calls irrev-
erent, as told to its author,
James Brough and is a look at
a life spent. entirely in the
theater.

Hardwicke, the son of a doctor,
was born‘ in Birmingham, Eng-
land in 1893. He lived among the
slums of factory workers there
and. decided/that life in an in-
dustrial town was not for him.
This decision plus a growing in-
terest in the theater impelled him
to enroll at the Royal Academic
of Dramatic Art.

As a member of the Birming-
ham Repertory Company, Hard-
wicke went to London with the
Company in 1924. There heap-
peared at the Court Theater in
George Bernard Shaw’s plays,
“Back to Methusela,” and the
“Farmer's Wife.”

Other plays in which Hard-
wicke has appeared are Shaw’s‘
“Ceasar and Cleopatra”, Edna
Freber’s “Show Boat” and “The
Biarr'ett’sc of, Wimpole Street.”

In 1937 Hardwicke was award-
ed the Delia Austrian-Medal by
the Drama League of New York.
He has played in such movies as,
“The Tudor Rose,” and “On Bor-
rowed Time.” He is the author of
“Let’s Pretend: Recollections and
Reflections of a Lucky Actor.”

At the usual time, 4:15 p.m.
April 12, Mrs. Hibberd V. B. Kline
will discuss Alan lVIoorehead’s,
‘The White Nile.” This isthe story

ed, evangelized and eventually
awakened the vast unknown
spaces of Central Africa.

In an effort to alleviate the tie

brary floor and to give students
more eﬁicient service, an ex-
press car will run exclusively
from the ground floor and one to

on this floor going up but, will

Stocking Feet Reviewer

Critic Asserts Writers
Exp’lainHu,manityBest

By PAT CHERKIN
Miss Virgilia Peterson stepped upon the stage before the

jacket and shoes, announcing
“I’m too tall for the mike.”

‘Midday Series audience this week, and calmly removed her

that “a button popped,” and

p Standing in her stocking feet, she began to explain why
writers are best equipped to tell “what it means to be

human.” -. ‘
Miss Peterson mentioned ﬁrst
“The Firmament of Time” by Dr.
Lauren Eisley, a scientist who
says, “I am a naturalist and fossil
hunter and I have crawled

' through life.”

Albert Camus is ‘another of
these gifted writers, said Miss
Peterson. Her favorite book of his
is ‘a collection of essays‘ and
speeches titled, “Resistance, Re-
bellion and Death.” , 4.

Camus’ classic on capital
punishment is in this collection.
Miss Peterson praised Camus,
calling him a “most. important
-European mind—-a tuning fork
sounding the note. of human
freedom.”

As ‘an example of one type of
human meaning, the speaker
mentioned the suffering and. spirit
of the Jew, as represented in An-
dre Schwartz-Bart’s “The Last of
The J ust.”" The book tells the story
«of a little Polish boy, who was
chosen to be the ‘just’ man of his
generation, and “to be a Jew every
day of the week.”

“The Wastemakers” by Vance
Packard does put it’s ﬁnger on
the truth, said Miss Peterson. But,
she added, the author “is a writer
only in the sense that he puts one
worddown after another.”

The speaker reviewed an-
other “crusader” book, John
He-sey’s “The Child Buyer.”
which she said, in contrast to
Packard’s work, turns crusades
into literature.

Virginia Peterson-,_ then discuss-
ed the symbolism in “To Kill A
Mockingbird,” by Harper Lee. The
book depicts a small-town Ala-
bama lawyer who defends a
young Negro falsely accused of
rape.

The mockingbird in the title is
a symbol of innocence, and both
are peculiarly American, Miss
Peterson noted.

A new interpretation of death
is offered in the next book that
the speaker reviewed. Cyrus
Seltzburger’s “My Brother Death”
draws away the cloak of immor-
tality, dropping the euphemisms

Signs of Progress .. . .

By Harriet Wehner
If students can be criticized for
dissenting, then administrators
can be’ criticized for_not under-
standing why there is an in-
crease in this type of student re-
action.
Eve r y o n e, 
e x c e p t stu '
dents, s e e m .;
to think that
the University
is ‘progressing
a t rocket’s
speed toward
the ideal col-
lege commu-
nity. But what
are the signs
of progress? Students know
there has been little, if any, ad-
vancement in the realm of stu-
dent—administrative r e l a t i o n s
since the trimester began. In
fact, their actions have been re-
gressive at times.
If a university were advanc-
' ing, it would surely include stu-
dents on committees that recom-
mend administrative, academic
or disciplinary policies. Students,

 

 

-A ...<- .-.

as well as administrators, can

point out weaknesses in.curric-
ulum,’ communications between
University members, distribution
of coursework, integration of
freshmen, and other areas of im-
' portance to a university commu-
nity. , _
Keep’ Goals in“ Sight ~ ‘ -I
When Chancellor Litchﬁeld
spoke at the«Tap Day -ceremony,
he stressed that a student’s goals
should -be kept in sight. I think
there are many students who are
trying to "keep a particular goal
relating to the University in
sight. Inspired by the newness

_ of the trimester, many of them

want to participate in its devel-
opment since they know better
than anyone else its weaknesses
as well as its strong points.

' It is true that students do not
possess the practical wisdom and
experience that administration
and faculty members should
have, but how does one gain
these qualities if the opportunity
is not provided?‘

’Many students are just begin-
ning to realize that their efforts
organizations

that they aren’t

. are
rather futile,
really contributing to other stu-
dents or to — the . University it-

_ self.

Administratorsor advisors to
the few student groups that are
functioning, channel student 0-
pionions in the direction of their
own policies. Yet, it is this stu-
partcipation that merits
award on Tap Days. It is this

mythical participation which ad-
ministrators discuss in whispers
behind closed doors unaware that

,students.also realize their own

worthless endeavors.
Standards Rising

The frustration and disillusion
that results from being managed,
controlled, directed, pampered or
ignored does not represent pro-
gress.

Our academic standards may
be rising, but nothing else is. Ad-
ministrators have succeeded only
in insulting the student’s intel-
lect, and tossing out into that
big, wide world a bitter person
who has learned‘ to neither trust
nor respect others simply be_-
cause he himself, has been the
subject of distrust and disre-
spect. A university that offers
society a student who has never
had the opportunity to develop
his leadership qualities by par-
ticipation in real activities, is not
doing that society a favor.
Concerned with Success

If the University’s administra-

tors are concerned with the tri-
mester’s success, then possibly
they should accept the fact that
they cannot ignore students. By
not encouraging students to ex-
press their opinions about goals
which all University members
should have in common, they are
slowly destroying the means by
which a universitly can develop
a student to his fullest potential-
ity.

Whether or not administrators
try to understand why students
are dissatisﬁed with the trimes-
ter is their prerogative. If they

. don’t there will always be a few

who will continue to step aside
and watch scornfully while they
continue to race toward that
illusionistic college community of
cooperation. '

i Lettersto

Editor’s note: Space does not
permit us to run all the letters
concerning Woody Turner or the
action; stimulated by his speech
on ’1(ap‘Da_y. -

(Turner Prompts

'Profess'ori,.s._. Views

Editor, The Pitt News:

Mr. Tur'ner’s Tay Day speech
was profoundly disturbing to me,
not-for what he said about the
University  administration, but
for what his speech

tions with our students.

Mr. Turner is an intelligent,
energetic, courageous y”6 u n g
man. For this the faculty can
take no credit. He‘ is superﬁcial.
For this we must take the blame.

-If he had been raised in the

‘USSR, he would now be a happy

young leader in a country where
man’s ultimate nature is presum-
ed known and whereit is gov-
ernment policy to extirpate all
evidences of non-conformity be-
tween the living culture and the
espoused value system. In a
drifting, morally decadent" so-

ciety such as ours, he is an angry -

young man. This I think is im-
plied, not by what he said, but
by what he failed to say.

There was no recognition that
we must operate in a world not
of our own choosing. Speciﬁcally,
he showed no comprehension of
the fact that a logically self-
consistent administration of a
publicly supported university is
an impossibility in a_ society
whose values, to put it mildly,
are not those of theeacademic
world, nor of the fact that, in so
far as talent is commanded by
money, a university is severely
handicapped in its search for
subordinate administrators. He
committed the cardinal sin of the
intellectual; he narrowed the
scope of his problem until he
could solve it, and then vigor-
ously set about its solution.

This’ is his teachers“ failure.
If he had encountered even a
few professors whose personal
revolt ‘against our culture was
matched by a deep understand-
ing of the human situation, one
supposes that some of that un-
derstanding might have rubbed
off. - it

Self-educed wisdom ‘comes in
old—age, if at all. Unless we, the
teachers ,can implant a little wis-
dom prematurely in our better
graduates, while they still have
energy and the will to rebel-
lion, our chances of renaissance
and survival are nil.

burning thoughts — even a curs-
ory glance through
Shop will discover many minds
smouldering away (or perhaps
these were copies of the Univer-

_ sity Bulletin, or, worse yet, The

Pitt News, being put to the
torch) —— burning thoughts, that
is, on the general subject of The
Big Bad Administrators, or, The
Chancellor’s New Clothes‘ and
How an Honest Lad Made All
Those Faces Turn Red.

Mr. Turneris speech, as revis-
ed by a no doubt wellemeaning
typographer and reprinted in
The Pitt News, was a well or-
ganized‘ and articulate piece of
work and I think Woody would
make a ﬁne administrator. It is

implied ‘
about our faculty and its rela-

the Tuck ‘

 

certainly true that many of his
points were accurate and telling,‘
but I also think, and this is my
major premise, that Administra-
tors, like they rest of us, Are
People. Follow that up With:
People, besides being funny, Are
Fallible, and you are hooked,
because, as you will learn in the

iintrothctory course to practically.

anything, trimester or no, if all

men ‘are mortal and Geise is a‘

mortal." then, obviously, Admini-
strators Are Fallible (and fun-
ny) Also, one of the saddest of
all human fallibilities stems from
losing sight of where the other
fellow is, or wants to be. Al-
though I have reached the ill-
ustrious age of 21, have pain-
fully acquired all my wisdom
teeth, and have taken a modi-
cum ofpsychology courses, I am
yet idealistic, or perhaps ‘just
plain naive enough to Believe
that in general persons with
power and authority do not de-
liberately misuse that power.
When they make what some
well—known entertainer aptly
refers to as a “boo—boo” they do
so usually out of neglect and/or
ignorance due to the lack of
contact with the ultimate source
of that authority.'This is cer-
tainly not commendable but it
is understandable and I don’t
think the Administration is the
villanious gang of cold-hearted
despots it has been made out to
be. ‘ _ ’
True, the students have a right
to expect‘ integrity, high ethical
standards, respect for Truth, etc.
etc. on the part of their leaders,
administrative and otherwise;
but, especially in these Turbu-
lent Times, when Pitt is. busy
becoming (choose one) a: better
and better day by day; b: a dirty
lousy diploma-factory; c: Lord
knows what; (but even He isn’t
sure sometimes), and suffering
all sorts of pangs, twinges, grow-
ing pains, and other unpleasant
sensations, the‘Men at the Wheel
have a right to expect patience,
at least from those who choose
to come here. Those who are
compelled to come have a right
to complain, but only to the
origins of that compulsion. For
those who chose to come but
have run out of patience, maybe
it would be diverting to organize
your protest. Since this is a total-
itarian regime, you would have
to go underground of course, and
hold clandestine meetings in the
fabulous catacombs under the
Cathedral, where . the skeletons
on martyrs await. Der Tag. You
could invite Castro to be a Mid-
night Series speaker; and when
the hour is ripe, brandishing
spindled, bent and torn IBM

, cards, you could march on the

Babcock Room and demand your
money back. Then you’d have to
ﬁnd a market for a s1ightly.used
ball—park. 

It is conceivable that I am too
tolerant of near‘-sighted admini-
strative tactics. But this is pro-
bably due totthe fact that, tri-
mester system, academic para-
sites, and‘ cancerous nests of
power-mad deans notwithstand-
ing, I have somehow managed
to become frightfully broaden-
ed,‘ liberalized, and who knows,
maybe even integrated. The trick
is tokeep your blood-shot eye on
your goal even when your clever
leaders are trying to point you
away from it.

Engineer's Role

Editorial Countered

Editor, The Pitt News:
In the March 8th edition of

the Editor’

The Pitt News an- editorial Wag
written on “The Men in Green”

which in effect said that the en- i

gineers don’t want to convey

’ their role of engineers t6 the

non-engineers.

First, in retaliation, let me say
that certainly  college student
is and ,does, as much as he
knows what a teacher, la»wyer,._p1-
doctor does. As it would be too

lengthy to give all the details,
«briefly an engineer is a planner, _ "

designer, constructor, and man-
ager of tangible and intangible
objects such as machinery, elec-
tricity, metals, bridges, chemi.
cals, planes, etc.

The mention of hills brings to
light another point made in the
editorial, that the only time En-
gineers descend" from the white
building on the hill is Engineer-’s
Week. Just where do we take
our non—engineering courses the
rest of the year if not at the
Cathedral? And more on this sub-
ject of the hill —- we are not
purposely keeping aloof ‘from

.the rest of the University. It is
merely due to the geographic lo-
cation that makes it impossible
to rundown to the Tuck Shop or
Student Union between classes
just as it is for SC.

Another phase of the editorial
questions the engineer’s role on
campus. I believe the main ob-
jective of the engineer is what
the main objective of any stu-
dent should be, and that is to
prepare oneself for his vocation
in life. If you meant, what ac-
tivities does an engineer en-
gage in, let me name a few. We
have what is known as the En-
gineering and Mines Association
— the governing body of the
School of Engineering and Mines,
which also holds social events

. during the year with money it

earns independently .,(not dona-
tions from the central Univer-
sity). Then there is the E&M
Bulletin, which, read by some of

the other students, would give‘

them the news of the engineers
on campus without bold report-
ers inquiring arid telephone calls
made at three minute intervals.
And also we publish the Sky-
scraper Engineer, a monthly
magazine technical and general
articles of an engineer in society
which also is on sale to all stu-
dents. And for physical activity,
we plan inter-department foot-
ball, basketball, bowling, and
other athletic events. ‘

Most of the things mentioned
are year round activities and or-
ganizations which lead me to
conclude that, yes, one week is
sufficient to “emphasize the role
of an engineer on the University
campus.” So if, as you say, “the
majority of students see only a
group of students invading the
Cathedral with their green hats”
it is only because that is all they
want to see.

and nuclear process engineering.

The Hagan Company will also
supply the laboratory with vari-
ous types of process control equip-

The department, which has
functioned under such programs
in the past, has planned a new
spring course in the advanced
ﬁeld of stochastics, which will
only be available on a post-

 de Jonge
Offers Views

On Own Course

By CHRISTINE LUNDBERG

Few teachers of natural sci-
ences will admite that their courses
have no applied value. Dr. Kieweit
de Jonge, a native of Holland, is

this. From his point of view, As-
tronomy l is worth learning only
for the sake of learning itself.

This course is valuable in dis-

ciplining the student‘ towards sci-
entiﬁc thinking and problem ap-
proach. It strives to explain the
,material stage in which life un-
folds.

"‘Astronomy is a challenge in
learning,” said Dr. de Jonge.
“It makes the student identify
the universe to a vast stage on
which the story of the expanding
physical universe is being por-
trayed.”:;s

are offered at the University in
the ﬁeld of astronomy. Astronomy
1 is a systematicapproach to the
physical universe with emphasis
on what is known, and how this
knowledge was obtained. ‘
It is a descriptive—quantitative
study involving some mathematics,
but not beyond the high school
level. .
A history of Astronomy is taught
by Dr. Nicholas E. Wagman, the
head of the Astronomy depart-
ment. Both are introductory
courses. ‘’ ‘
Drgde Jonge explained that
even larger universities with
Astronomy departments do not
offer a‘ major in the ﬁeld to un-
dergraduates.
Graduate courses are offered to
compliment actual experience at
the Allegheny Observatory, where

puter laboratory.

the department is located.

Larry Lauchle

 ‘Mighty Mites’
Lose Lauchle R

' C
After Nationals
Senior Captain Vies
V For National Crown
By BOB SMIZIK
Whenever a professional
sports team becomes a con-
sistent winner, almost invar-
iably the cry arises from the
loyal supporters of ‘the un-
derdog’, “break them up.”

In collegiate sports that cry
never comes forth because it is
known that sooner or later gradu-
ation will break up a great team.

Here at Pitt, graduation is about
to dissolve the most successful
group to hit Skyscraper U.‘ in
many years. In a matter’ ' of
months Larry Lauchle will re-
ceive his diploma and thus mark

” ﬁnis of the reign of the wrestling

“mighty mites.”
Outstanding Lightweight
Lauchle and his fellow “mites,”
"Rich Martin, Daryl ‘ Kelvington
and John Zolikoff have given the
Panthers the most outstanding
group of lightweight wrestlers in
the country for the past two cam-
ipaigns. During that time the
“mighty mites” have complied a
63-43 record. They have cap-
tured three Eastern titles, four
second places and one third.

If one member. of the group
standsvout it is Lauchle. While
his three cohorts were still dis-_
playing their wares for the
frosh, Larry was making a big
name for himself with the var-
sity. - if .

As a sophomore Lauchle capped
an undefeated season by winning
the Eastern championship at 130
ponds and then ﬁnished second in
the National Tournament in the
123 pound class.

Elected Captain

*The following season, although
only a junior, Larry’s teammates
saw ﬁt to elect him captain. To
those who know _him it was no
surprise. His perpetual grin and
keen sense of humor make him an
easyman to like. During a meet
Larry is always ready with timely
advice and words of encourage-
ment for his fellow wrestlers.

Larry’s Junior year was al-
most a duplicate of the previous
year, except for one major dis-

A appiontment. He was beaten in
the ﬁnals of the Easterns. How-
ever, he repeated his second
‘place ﬁnish in the Nationals.

‘Last summer, in what appeared
to be a futile attempt, Larry tried
out for the United States Olympic
Greco-Roman wrestling team. His
chances of making the squad were
slim ‘because he had never wres-
tled the Greco-Roman -style be-
fore. It is vastly different from

V collegiate wrestling.

‘They Dis

(EDITOR’S NOTE: THIS IS A

like Us, 
liut Hate You, ‘Sue ’

COPY OF A LETTER SENT

FROM A CO-ED AT’ PENN, STATE TO HER FRJEND AT

PITT.)

Now, Judy, you are not

going to believe what I am

about to tell. In fact, you are going to call me a liar but be-

lieve me, Jud'y,.'it’s the truth.

I know the wrestlers at Pitt have told you about seeing

a match at Lehigh. I know the
kept telling me stories but I

boys on our team have. They
never believed them. Well,

Judy, I went to Easterns last¢
week-end and I will never forget
it. Nero’s group was nothing com-
pared to this bunch.

They dislike us but, Judy, they a
hate you. Every time a Pitt wres-

body would yell, “Sit down, you
burn. Go back to Pittsburgh.” I
was told they were still upset over
losing 16-14) to you. Actually,
upset isn’t the word. They are still
furious. And all this over a
wrestling match. .

I was told Navy lost to Le-
high. You know that your
coach’s son (Rex Peery) son
(Ed) coaches Navy. Well, when
Rex walked onto the gym ﬂoor,
they'yelled, “We took care of .
your son. Now it’s your turn.”
\ You once told me about the
fans at Morgantown (West Vir-
ginia Basketball rooters‘; but they
cannot be one—tenth as bad as
these people. At West Virginia,
they applaud a performance by a
visitor but not at Lehigh. It just

isn’t right. ‘

Then there was one match
when a Pitt boy was winning. He
kept away from his opponent and
the Lehigh people yelled, “Quit
stalling, Pitt. .You’re a bunch of
bums. Go-home.” Then at Lehigh
boy (althoughthey keep saying
they are not taught to) did the
same thing. “Good strategy. Won-
derful strategy.” It just doesn’t
make sense. I

I also felt sorry for your one
wrestler (Larry Lauchle). He
won first place (130) and some
of those Lehigh monsters booed.
It was a disgrace.

I could go on and on, Judy. I
remember you told me how upset
you were when a few Duquesne
students rode your basketball
team.*That isn’t too bad. At least
when the game Was over, they
applauded.

In many ways, this tournament
reminded me of Lord Tennyson’s
“Charge of the Light Brigade.”
Those boys had it easy compared
to your boys and mine.

I understand there was 'a lot
of noise in the press row. I
looked up and saw a guy from

Columbia .(Phil Burke—pub-
licity director) yelling and
shouting. I understand your

publicity“ director (guess who)
had a little trouble. Our man’
(Jim Tarman) was calm until
Johnston Oberly (heavyweight)
wrestled. He wanted him to pin
that Lehigh man. I at ﬁrst felt
terrible about Johnston being
so much bigger than that Le-
high man.

Well, I 'quickly remembered

how all those~Lehigh people rode‘

our coach (Charlie Speidel) and
I yelled with the other Penn State
people.

I. understand. the Easterns are
at Penn State next year. I am go-
ing to see our athletic director

(Ernie McCoy) and tell him he‘

should tell our fans to be polite
and fair. I remember last year
when your cute Dick Martin de-
feated ourvTony Scorbo in a close
match. Although your man won,
everybody in the place stood up
and applauded. They appreciated
a great performance.

Now don’t get me wrong, Judy.
We don’t love Pitt but I think we
are pretty good sports. We want
to win but if we don’t, I am going
to root for you against Lehigh. .

Before you graduate, Judy, be
sure to see a wrestling match at
Lehigh. You haven’t lived until
you do. It will make those silly
fraternity parties ‘look like tea
parties. .
Your friend,

Sue

Netmen Open Card
In Three Weeks

For the last two weeks about
15 boys, under the careful eye of
Head Coach Bill Summers, have
been practicing I tennis funda-
mentals on the Field House hand-
ball courts.

The netters are preping for
a difﬁcult 15 game season which
opens against Juniata College on
April 8. All the Panther home
matches will be played on the
,Wildwood Country Club courts.

The six matches that are slated
to play at home will be another

Infielders Thinned   by  Injury
' Cuthbert Responding
Slowly to J Treatment

By JIM 0’BRIEN
William Shakespeare once wrote in his play, Anthony
and Cleopatra, that “some griefs are_med—cinable.” Although _
Coach Bobby Lewis is no, bard, he did author, some neat
plays in by-gone years on the diamond, and he now echoes
the above sentiment when dwelling on his inﬁelding situ-

ation. -

can be cured if the magical al-
chemy of trainer Roger McGill
proves successful in the case of
Bob Cuthbert,
junior second-
sacker, who is
hobbled by a
leg injury.

During the
initial f i v e
games of the
upcoming sea-
son, Lewis
must manipu-
late a token
inﬁelding. corps
of five men, ,
that is, if Cuthbert responds to

Cuthbert

treatment. Three of these in-
ﬁelders are lettermen, a mark
which. distinguishes only four

players altogether.

Hits .296
Cuthbert batted a ﬁne .296 last
season, and was a highly-toutde
forward on oC,‘ach Leo Bemis’ soc-
cer team this fall. “Corky” was
injured, however, and only per-
formed sparingly for the booters.
“Corky” has yet to work out
with his teammates, but has
been just as busy beneath the
ﬂoors of the Pitt Field House
in the trainer’s room. Cuthbert
has been lifting weights-—steel
shoes——and McGill measures his
leg in various sectors periodic-
ally to see how he is responding.
“I guess I’ll be lifting those
heavy shoes for the rest of my
life,” Cuthbert moaned. “I was
on crutches for four days and ever
since I’ve abandoned them, I’ve
adopted the clodhoppers. Roger
(McGill) says that if I don’t hurt
it again, I should be ready.”
Vacuum Inﬁeld
There was another vacuum in
the inﬁeld created unexpectedly
even before the glovemen donned

power-hitting ﬁrst baseman, va-
cated his_position to throw his lot
in with the Los Angeles Dodgers

In Lewis’ case, his biggest grief¢

 

their practice togs. Rory, Maser,‘

at Vero Beach. Coach Lewis call-
ed Maser, “as good a glove man
as there is in the majors today.”
Lewis feels that he has solv-
ed the ﬁrst base problerm by.
Switchiﬂg‘ Shortstop Pete. Suder,
who was one of the country’s
leading collegiate hitters last
term with a whopping .406‘ clip,
. to Maser’s old post. -
Captain Jerry Matulevic is a
mainstay at the “hot-corner”, and
the ﬁnal occupant of the short-
stop position promises to be a
newcomer from the sophomore
ranks.

Golf Team to

Start Practice '

Everyone talks about the weath-
er but no one does anything about
it. The Panther golfers are well
aware of this. After all, snow-
balls and golf balls just don’t mix.

With‘the advent of favorable
weather, the Panther golf men
will take to the links in prepara-
tion for the oncoming season.
Their ﬁrst match is at Ohio State
on April 8th.

Coach George Underwood had
this to say in sizing up the situa-
tion: “I wish the weather would
clear up. The boys have to get
out and practice. Our ﬁrst match
is in less than four weeks.”

_Underwood is looking for-

ward to an excellent season.
Experience is no problem. Let-
termen returning are Don Der-
mitt, Stewart Snodgrass, Dale
Long, Gary Stewart and Wil-
liam Herron. ‘

There also are 12 freshmen try-
ing out.

 

Denis Peters. There will be a
freshmen team until. April 24
when the boys become ﬁrst tri-
mester sophomores and are eligi-
ble for varsity play.

Cat Athlete In
Quandry Over
1 ECAC vs NCAA

Executive Sports Editor

By JACK Sl\IITH

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIlIlIIIIIIlIIIIIIII'

National Collegiate Athletic Association rules are not hard for
any college to follow. But the University is also a member of the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference, and although these organiza-
,tions have many of the same rules, the ECAC has extra ones which
/4 can be the cause of confusion.

Confusion is not only in the mind of the public but in the players’
minds too. Only last week, for instance, a group of athletes played

in a charity basketball game near Monongahela.

Arrangements for

the game were made by Lou Cecconi, Pitt’s backﬁeld coach in football.
The athletes, all seniors, played as a favor to Cecconi and were given
‘$5 each for traveling expenses. Being seniors, they could not partici-
"°l pate in sports next year, thus they had no fear of losing their eligibil-

ity for accepting money.

There was one athlete, however, who was not a senior. He was
Fred Cox, Pitt’s star halfback who hails from the Monongahela area.
Cox did not play before his hometown crowd because he was ‘afraid
of losing his football eligibility for accepting the expense money.

.“I would liked to have played,” Cox said,
isn’t worth a year of football to me.”

“but ﬁve dollars

Contrary to what Mr. Cox and the public believes,“-;under NCAA
*’ rules he could have accepted as much as $7.50 for incidental expenses
as long as it did. not come from a professional athletic association. He
could even have played on a team against professionals, but not with

professionals on his team.

According to NCAA rules, anbamateur athlete is one who engages
in athletics for physical, mentalj social and educational beneﬁts he
derives from the sport. Anyone who takes or has accepted the promise
of pay, in any form, is not eligible for intercollegiate competition.

Under these conditions, Cox couldhave participated and still
maintained his amateur standing. ‘But then the ECAC hasia clause
in addition to the NCAA rules that says the athlete must also get
permission from the University's Athletic Director before he
participates in any sport outside the University’s jurisdiction. It’s
true that Cox did not have that permission, but he could have
gotten it. By misunderstanding the rules governing his case, Cox
passed up the opportunity to play before his hometown fans.

Maybe this incident with ‘Cox isn’t important, but it does show.

how the rule differences between the ECAC and the NCAA can cause
some confusion. During” the ‘next few weeks I hope to explain differ-
ences in rules between the two governing bodies that confuse both

_athletes and students.

Bd ED HOWARD
There was more blue than
gold in the Panther colors in
October of 1954, as the foot-
ball team prepared for its
Saturday bout with the Naval
Academy.

The Jungle Cats were “singing
the blues” over their first three
games. They had scored a total
of only 14 points while dropping
decisions to Southern Cal, Minne-
sota and Notre Dame. Moreover,~
the Middies had yet to lose. Eddie
Erdelatz’s men had won the same
number as the Panthers had lost,
and were destined to win them
all after the game at the DeSota
Street stadium. “

Then, early in the week before
the" game, the “most unkindest
cut of all” became apparent. The
Panthers, who were to be depriv-
ed ofithe services of All—American
end Joe Walton because of in-
juries, found themselves without
a coach. Amiable Red Dawson was
stricken with heart irregularity
and was confined to a hospital
bed.

Called Captain

Since Dawson would not be
available for the rest of the sea-
son, Panther Athletic Director
Tom Hamilton, referred to as
f‘Captain,” was forced to hurried-
ly choose an interim coach. He
solved the dilemma by deciding
to finish the season as head
coach himself.

This wasn’t as irregular as it
sounds, since Hamilton for years
‘had been among the nation’s top
grid mentors. In fact, Captain
Hamilton acquired both his rank
(really Admiral) and the bulk
of his coaching reputation at the
very same Naval Academy his
squad was to face that Saturday.
The coincidence can be carried
even further. Tht\se two teams
had last met in 1934. The Pan-
thers won, spoiling on otherwise
unblemished Navy slate. The Navy
coach: Tom Hamilton, of course.
And his top aide at that time was
a young man named Eddie Erde-
latz. '
