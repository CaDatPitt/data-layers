Letters

Editor’s- note: '5' The following
letters are expressio-ns of the at-
titude of the student body in
l’aﬁai;re Hoode. That Dr. Hovcle
is held in the highest esteem by
students who have taken his
classes, may be seen in a perusal
of these letters. The‘Pitt News
has received no letters unfavor-
able to the News stand that Dr.
Hovde should return to the cam-
pus. The list is limited by lack
of space.
Editor, The Pitt News:

Dr. Hovde is one of the most
inspiring instructors I have known
at the University. His sincerity

and tinder-standing,‘ together -with .

his scholar'l'y”‘ approach to the
problems of history created a
warm respect for him among his
students.
-—Karl Punzak, C38.

-Editor, The Pitt News:

Dr. I-Iovde-’s failure to return to
campus will be a great disap-
pointment to those students who
knew him. His great learning
combined with a personality par-
ticularly adapted to teaching col-
lege students is needed at the
University.

—Rosemary Lutz, C39.
Editor, The Pitt lxewsz

Dr. Hovde is-without peer as a
scholar, a teacher and a gentle-
man. It is men like him who
make life fuller. His knowledge,
breadth of mind, and clear think-
ing take it an intellectual treat
to know him. He adds a needed
intellectual spark to our campus.

—-William Stark, C38.
Editor, The Pitt News:

No greater injustice to the stu-
dent body could possibly have
been accorded it than was evi-
denced the other day by the ad-
1nii1isti‘ation attitude toward D1‘.
Hovde. '

Open—minded scholarly teach-
ers are too rare to permit them
to be taken away from us as eas-
ily as they have been.

the material he offered. His course

I would consider it an irreparable

cil, will be open every day of ex-
amination week from 10:30 to 1:30
o’clock..

At the set hours, in anticipa-
tion of the new semester, students
who wish to sell their old texts
may hand them over to the ex-
change, which then sells the books
for the students. Although the
business done by the exchange

.during exam week is primarily to

build up its stock of used books,
students may procure second-
hand books at this time.

At present the exchange has on

‘ hand about 200 books. Proﬁt made

in the sale of books accrues to the
Student Loan Fund.

Bob Forsythe, C40, chairman of
the exchange, ., aski.ng for student
co-operation, declares “The book
store worked successfully last
year, and since it is conducted by
students for students, we would
like to see it function even more
successfully this year. The only
way this can be done is for every
one to bring in his old books.”

Stories In Today’s issue

A
V

Three short short stories are in-
cluded in today's issue of the Pitt
lPanthe1*, it has been revealed by
seditor Tom Smith, C39.

 The stories were written by two
students and one graduate, who is
‘living now in New York. The
graduate is Les Hammer, who
writes of the dark streets of New
York in his short entitled “Man-
,hattan Melodrama.”

“Sally” by Estelle Kovacs and
“The Broken Dish” by S. S. Kal-
wary are the student writers’ 1".ic—
ition contribution. The first con-
cerns a couple who had a spat
and tried their own way to “drown
their sorrows.”

A serious article on the sorrows
and horrors of war is written by
Alice Benovitz. Its title is “They
Were to Graduate in ’48.” The
regular fashion features include
this month for the men, “How to
Care for Clothes, (modeled by
Ray Light).

“The Cash Register” is the new
headline for» Bernie Cashdollar’s
regular questionnaire feature. A
new feature section was created,
“Refutations on Lines,” to include
a, letter received by the editor
shortly after the December issue
of the Panther appeared with
Frank Miller’s “Jock and I.” This
letter is being printed anonymous-
ly as the writer still refuses to di-
vulge his or her name, despite
Editor Smith's plea via the “Per-
sonal Ads” column of The News.

 Registratioii
Will Begin
On February 2

Second-semester registration for
underg1:'aduatc students will be
conducted from Wednesday, Feb-
v ruary 2, through Friday, February
4, according to the schedule on
study lists distributed this week.

Serving as permits for second-
semester registration, study lists
are being distributed today to all
stuclents in the School of Educa-
tion by the office of the registrar,
8 State hall, open from 8 o’clock
to noon and from 1 to 4 o’clock
this afternoon.

Students in the College and the
Schools of Engineering, Mines,
and Business Administration. were
to have received their study lists
from the office of the_registrar on
Monday and Tuesday. Students
in those schools who have not al-
ready procured study lists should
call for them as soon as possible,
says John G. Quick, registrar.

Complete directions for regis-
tration are contained in study
lists, which are numbered serial-
ly according to school and serve
as permits to register. On study
lists, students must fill in their
ﬁrst-semester schedules and pro-

posed schedules for the second
semester.
In order to register, students

must have study lists properly
ﬁlled out, warns Mr. Quick. No
student will be admitted. to the
registration area in the Commons
room without a study list.

If changes of sections are ne-
icessary or new courses are to be
‘added, signatures of heads of the
departments concerned must be
obtained on the study list during
registration. Ordinarily, courses
and sections will remain the same
as those of the ﬁrst semester.

Freshmen entering the Univer-
sity in February will register
Wednesday, February 2, begin-
ning at 9 o’clock.

Students in the evening, late
afternoon, and Saturday classes
will be mailed permits to register.
They will be scheduled for either
Friday, February 4, from 11:30 to
8 o’clock or Saturday, February 5.

Lecturer Stresses 
Foresight

Need Of
_Dr. Holmes Tells
Forum Of Men’s

Interdepeiidence

By ROBERT ADAMS

Foresight" in working for the
“larger objectives of life is a
prime necessity for the younger
generation, in the opinion of Dr.
Jesse Holmes, professor emeritus
of philosophy at Swarthmore
college, who ‘addressed Inquiry
Forum‘ Monday. V

“We human beings are well
stocked with instincts,” declared
Dr. Holmes, “and one of them—
:toresight—has turned out to be
most eﬁective in gaining control
of the earth for us.

‘“‘.'I‘he ability to see in advance
the ends we want to attain and of
estimating their values, and then
planning for the future and set-
ting to work to get that future--—
that is what foresight has meant
for us.”

NEW INTERDEPENDENCE

Stiessing the fact. that man is
essentially dependent upon others
for practically all of the material
things of life, Dr. Holmes stated
that one cannot possibly live with
reference to his interests today,
but must consider the interests of
many other people.

“The only imperative of life
that we humans feel,” he contin-
ued, “is the accumulation of val-
ues of life. That accumulation is
the basis of religion. But religions
have gone astray in trying to tie
themselves in formulas about
things that have happened.”

LVEACIVIINE DEPENDABLE

“As a result of our foresight,
we have succeeded in taking con-
trol of nature, until now we have
about 300 man-power in use for
every flesh-and-blood man. To-
day, who would take a human be-
ing to do his work, if he had the
option of taking a machine. A

’machine can’t cause a rumpus by
going on strike, or by requiring a
certain standard of living.

“If our generation were left in
charge of the world, there might
be grave danger that we would
let the system come to‘ disaster.
VVe congratulate
able to start in life where you are
today, but we don’t want you to
let the human race down when
you have such a tremendous
start,” ‘declared Dr. Holmes.

With Win Over Tech

Pitt (lagers Meet
Irish Tonight,
Hoyas Friday

By S. S. KALWARY

Dr. Carlson honked in his hand-
kerchief, the ball was sent up be-
twe‘en"the_'centers for the opening
tip-of-E, Myles Zeleznik found the
hoop for the first goal on a neat
set-up, and the Pitt—Tech City
series was on. Very much on for
the Panthers.

With the Oaklanders from this
side of the tracks showing their
best basketball to date—-the kind
they’ll need tonight to make a re-
spectable stand against the highly
;<ki.ll.ed basl.-:et—mal{e:'s of Notre
Dame —they soundly whipped the
Scotchmen i'rom the other side
of the tracks, 50-33, lvlonclay, at
the Stadium. -

“Ziich"’ Zeleznik, in a whirl-
wind fashion and on a very profit-
able business ‘relationship with the
Hoop and Net Company, led the
Carlson team, vcliich moved the
‘ball down the ﬂoor to the goal
register with the zip and precision
of a 15-cylinder automobile, for
21 two-pointe I-le peppered the
bucket for  field goals and two
fouls, and was tied for the scoring
honors with 'fecli’s Captaiii Billy
Miller, with 1% points.

“'ZILCH," MILIJER STAR

Z’-eleznil: exhibited all the finesse
of an All-Ainerican. His work
"was fractionally over-shadowed
only by the nimble Miller, xvlm

count, and cemented the Tartan

one fell apart ‘under the brilliant
Pitt machine.

in the Skll“lD.lSl1 for four full
quarters.

Maxie Hannum‘s outfit did not
look bad. His scrappy senior
mite, “Buzzy” Greenberg, and star
sophomore, “Toughy” Tumpane,
did everything‘ they possibly could
for the Plaid. The Pittmen were
just too good. ‘

After absorbing‘ the racy ball-
handling of the smaller and speed-
ier Carnegie cagers during the
ﬁrst half, when the score read,
21-14, in favor of the Blue and
Gold, the Pantliers took a decided
spurt in the second period and
blasted away all Tech Victory am-
bit-ion.

Company wien “Zilch” was busy
elsewhere, passing. blocking and
feeding them for set-ups. “Rags”
was the next highest scorer, net-
ting himself 12 points, and Spot-
ty was one notch behind, with 11.

IRISH, HOYAS IEERE

The Tartan contest was only
the beginning of a hard week for
the Carlsonmen. The Irish of-
South Bend, Indiana, move into
the DeSota St. court this evening,
with their All-American giants
of last year, Johnny Moir and Joe
Nowak, and a half-dozen other
Notre Dame dribblers of note.

Ice Against Strong

Cleveland Outﬁt

A greatly improved Pitt entry
in the Ohio-Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate Hockey Iseague will
take the ice tonight against what
is recognized to be the strongest
combination in the Ohio division,
John Carrol college.

This meeting tonight on the Du-
quesne Garden ice marks the sec-
ond venture of Coach John Mc-
S-orley and his Blue and Gold out-
fit this season.

NEW LINEUP A

A month ago Pitt opened the
season against Duquesne and
dropped a rough and tumble at-
fair by a 3-1 score. Since then
l\/lcsorley has been juggling his
lines trying to put together a sex-
tet with some punch at the nets.

Pitts biggest problem tonight
will be in adjusting its defense
to stop the fast skating Eddie Ar-
senault who sticks them from the
pcrtsi.de and has averaged four
goals. per game for a sum total of
16 goals and three assists.

‘Ethical’ Question
In The Hovde Case

N AN IN(’,TlDEI\"'l‘ that never should liave

happened, the lfniversitv is about to earn

the contempt.‘ of liberal educators the couiitii-y
over and of the local public of the. district.

Dr. B. J-. llovdc has been denied the right to

teach part-time. at the Ui1iversit.y while hold-

ing 3' p°Si''ti0n 33 director of th" ("'ity’S De]mrt' l ducc-oi in England hearing‘ this bv-line. “Written ’l).V

ment of \Veli’are, because of “ethical rea.sons.,”
and the disruption of the histor_v depzirtincnt
staff orga.nizat.ion.

The statement by University oﬂicials followed
by a blast. from City Council President. O”l‘oole,
followed closely by an unini'ormcd editorial in
the Pittsburgh Press, unf0rt1111a.tely will neither
end nor settle this matter satist'v.cto1'ily.

The repercussions seem to luive just begun.
Already we have found wide dissatisfaction
with the ad1ninistr21.tion’s move, from former
students of Dr. Hovde, alumni, liberals, and
other thinking people inside and outside Uni-
versity life.

The Pitt News t'lll.9lll1_)f€Cl to :mswer the state-
ment. rega.rding the disruption of the history
department if Dr. llovde were to be allowed to
teach on R part.-time basis. , Our answer to that
was tliot, valid as the statciiient may be, Dr.
Hovde’s presence in the Ilis’r.or_v department
was worth any little inconvenience to that de-
partnient.

And now, on the matter of “ethical 1'e:i.so11s”
for Dr. llovde giving up tea.cl1ing, we V1'e.co1n-
mend to you the story on page one which is a
partial list of the University faculty who have
been or are now doing outside work, while at
the same time teaching on campus.

Just what, does this mean '3 If this “e_t_.hical
reasons” item is a valid one, why is it not ap-
plied To all Universit-y professors?

Or is private business more szmctiiiecl than
public service?

Now do not think for a. moment that we
advocate that every University faculty as-
sociate should drop all outside activities, or
drop his school work in preference.

The contrary is true. We believe that
faculty-men gain much in their contacts out-
side the University, that these gains will
result. in broadened views that will make
them better educators. The thirty men
listed on page one receive our congratula-
tions for putting their knowledge to prac-
tical use and for gaining more practical
knowledge in return.

And we can see no valid reason why those
who have the opportunity should not be per-
mitted to increase their revenue outside the
campus. Educators are a notoriously under-
paid group, and at the University one could
hardly say that the situation is different.

What we would like to know, though, is why
Dr. Hovde has been made an exception. Why
is he picked out from the list of men who do
both teaching and outside work as long as he
showed the capability of performing both?

And‘ so we fear tliatthe ghosts of anti-libexu
alism at the University may again be dragged
from the cupboards where the dust has hardly
settled. The situation is unfortunate, and if
Dr. Hovde is not permitted to return, we be-
lieve it may be disastrous.

We repeat again that it never should have
happened.

The eight-page Daily Texan shows that the Uni-
versity of Texas favors the New Deal policy by a
60.8 majority. 20.1 frown on the New Deal. 10.1

Buttonbagatelle

By Shorty Long

Today we are going to hold a special session of

are going to begin with quotations from an article.
by the ruddy Irishman in G. K.’s Weekly entitled
"Me, VVells and Chesterton. Said he:

“My works are a‘ bible in which men can ﬁnd

the problems they are roaring about like beasts in
a zoo when an earthquake shakes them. The works
of G. K. Chesterton and H. G. Wells are full of v.'i’s-‘
dom and warnings that, if heeded, would have abol-
ished War, epidemics, gangsterism, and all the hor-
rors of capitalistic civilization long ago. We three
roar louder, and over wider circulations, and much
more amusingly than Ruskin, Marx, or Henry
George. , But nobody marks us.”

combining an intense public activity with an ex-
tension of popular initiative an individual freedom
beyond the power of workers under liberal capi-
talist-n even to conceive, and I think that th.ou.gh
I and my fellow geniuses, being such incorrigible
vagabonds mentally, will not cooperate with one
another, we might at least give an encouraging pat
on the back to any statesman who manages by
ﬂuke or crook to make a step in our direction .

“And we should pay much more attention to the
churches. All the churches should institute a good

spring cleaning everygyear as to their doctrines and

. rituals, with a vigorous reformation at least once

every twenty years.”

'Well, so much for Shaw, Shaw. Shaw, and Rus-
sia. Now for Shaw and Shakespeare, if we may
mention them in the same breath. The Sha.ke-
spearean drama “C,vmbelin.e” was recently pro-

William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw.”

Yep, GBS has rewritten “Cymbcline.” Whether
or not the fact that the play happens to have par-
allel circumstances with the abdication of Edward
VIII was the reason for this Elizabethan-Hibernian
alliance we do not know. George Bernard Pshaw!

From the London Observer: “Professor Valen-
tine told the British association that he had seen
Mr. Bernard Shaw ‘shaking with laughter when he
went to one of his own plays.’ Well, there seems
to be no reason why the author should be the only
man in the world who may not enjoy his own jokes.
And, on the whole, Mr. Shaw holding his sides is a
prettier spectacle than Tennyson sitting in 9. box at
his own play and “loudly applauding the best pas-
sages.”

 Senators Have Ulterior

‘ Motive About Lynch Law

By foseph

McCloskey

,Sc>ut.lJ<31~i1 Senators are ﬁlibust.eriug' in the name of states’
ri.gl'2ts. 'l‘l1<-ryiiisist. that the passage of an anti-lynching bill will
set. a. h :n"mi.'11l p1'ccc(lcn.’(, that it will serve as on entering wedge
for tho i”iurtIhcr encroa.clnnent of the federal government upon

the police powers of the states.

Are the gentlemen from

the South sincere when they

argue thus‘! ls t.here~ not a possibility that they have an ulterior

motivairion based upon a threat°

to their,_economifcy integrity rather
than their political integrity?

One of the most important
measures pending before the pres-
ent session of Congress is the
wages and hours bill. The prin-
cipal opposition to this legisla-
tion also centers in the South. Is
it not just possible that the South-
ern Senators will call off_tl,,1eirﬂl-
ibuster if they can secure‘ a
promise to include sectional dif-
ferentials in the wages and hours
bill?

Wage Law Favored

An affirmative answer is logical
for the reason that it is more
easy to convince a constituency

of the evil of an act which de--,

prives that constituency of one of
its favorite diversions, rather
than to convince the folks back
home that :2. law which will secure
for them higher wages and short-
er hours is also evil. Even the

paternalism of southern manufac-
turers cannot _witl_is_t,andv the ap-
peal of more money for less work.

Idle Legislature

In arguing this, of course, one
may be accused of giving a Sena-
tor credit for having enough
mental acumen to reason ahead,
but most people do become more
acute when their pocketbooks are
threatened.  '

And meanwhile, we must sit
back and endure the continuation
of a scene which started when the
President proposed that the Su-
preme Court be reformed—the
legislative branch of our govern-
ment will do everything but legis-
late. '

 And if it should become neces-
sary for the executive branch to

stitutional means, the Southern
 Senators will probably be the first
E to scream ,“Dictatorship!”
