Imprisoned LaRouche speaks out about his critics

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer

,Editor’s Note: The following is
the first installment of a three—part
series investigating the incidents
and allegations surrounding the
conviction of political activist
Lyndon LaRouche.

Political maverick Lyndon
LaRouche said in an exclusive
Pitt News interview that his re-
cent jail sentence is the result of
a political vendetta against him
set in motion by the United States
government.

He received a 15-year prison
‘sentence on Jan. 27 on one count
of conspiracy and one count of
mail fraud. The mail fraud charge
involves $294,000 worth of loans

, made by his supporters. The can-

LaRouche attempted to impede

_ somehow.

from determining his tax liability.
LaRouche is presently being
held in the county jail in Alexan-
dria, Va., and is expected to be
moved to federal prison within
two weeks. He hopes to be
paroled within five years.
LaRouche said that all charges
against him are false and that he
considers himself a political
prisoner. ”The government start-
ed the operation and set up a task
force to get me for political rea-
sons,” he said. ”The operation
was set in motion by the presi-
dent's Foreign Intelligence Advi-
sory Board. They said, ’Get him
According to LaRouche, the
operation by the federal govern-
ment to ”get him” began in Oc-
tober of 1983. Charges brought
against him included tax evasion,
misuse of credit cards and other
financial schemes.

Pitt's '89 College Bowl champion crowned  

By Michael Seperack
Staff Writer

‘There were several hours of ac-

9 tion over four intense rounds, but

when it was over, Zippy y Los
Tres Amigos won the College
Bowl competition.

Nine teams competed Thurs-
day night for the right to represent
the University of Pittsburgh at the
regional competition in Washing-
ton, D.C.

”|t’s just for kicks,” said Jason
Bloomberg, a member of the win-

8 ning team.

”There really isn't any way to
prepare'for it,” added Zippy y Los
Tres ' Amigos team captain

Michael Young. ”You just need

to know a lot of weird infor- '

mation.”

The four-member Zippy team
also included Chris Weber and
Fred Hann, with Madeline Larson
as the alternate.

The Zippy team beat The Un-
touchables in a closely contested
final round with a score of
110-60. They led with a score of
45-30 at halftime. The Untouch-
ables tied the score early in the
second half, but Zippy y Los Tres
Amigos pulled out -to an 80-40
advantage with two minutes re-
maining and coasted from there.

In the College Bowl, teams of
four members each square off in

on the charges of mail fraud and
conspiracy. However, the case
was declared a mistrial,
LaRouche said, because the
government knew it was going to
lose the case. The case was then
brought to Alexandria in an at-
tempt, according to LaRouche, to

railroad him.

”The Boston case was coming
up for retrial at the beginning of
this year. But, they knew they
were going to lose it, so they
recrafted the Boston case and put
a few little touches on it and ran
it here in Alexandria. So they
used that technique to get a con-
viction with a railroad,”
LaRouche said. ‘

”Virginia is the only railroad in
the United States which runs on
time,” he added.

LaRouche claimed that the Vir-
ginia jury was stacked with em-
ployees from the federal
government.

head—to-head competition. The
moderator asks questions, and
the teams hit their buzzers and
give their answers. The team to
answer a question correctly
scores points and also gets the
chance to answer a bonus ques-
tion for additional points. Each
round is broken into two five-
minute halves.

Some of the questions from
Thursday night's competition in-
cluded:”Name the six types of
quarks,” ”Who created the fic-
tional character Father Brown?”
and ”What two plagues did Jim-
my Carter wish upon Ronald
Reagan?”

At one point it looked ',like

The operation to indict
LaRouche began, he said, be-
cause leaders in the Soviet Union
asked the U.S. Justice Depart-
ment to do so in order to main-
tain good relations.

According to LaRouche, the ac-
tions which the Soviet Union
took against him stem from his
theories of Soviet conspiracies
which threaten world peace.

”The Soviets demanded my
head,” he said. '

Other political theories that
LaRouche disclosed included
worldwide drug trafficking or-
ganized by Great Britain. He also
claims that many high-ranking
U.S. government officials are in-
volved with satanic organi-
zations.

The Soviet Union, according to
LaRouche, wanted him eliminat-
ed because of his involvement
with the Federal Bureau" of Inves-
tigation. However, LaRouche

going home early. In the first
round they trailed Camisura’s
Kids 60-0, and fell as far as 65
points behind before coming
back to beat the team, 130-60.

”We knew we had it all the
way,” said Leshock after the
comeback. ”We were just biding
our time, waiting for the ques-
tions that we knew.”

would not explain his actual in-
volvement with the FBI.

LaRouche is registered as a
member of the Democratic Party,
but according to his press secre-
tary, Dana Scanlon, his ideology
does not always allow him to be
easily categorized.

She described him as a conser-
vative Democrat or a maverick
Democrat.

LaRouche has attacked U.S.
policy toward third-world nations
because he feels they are being
exploited. He is an advocate of
health care for all U.S. citizens
and believes in improving the
standard of such care. LaRouche
is also a supporter of the Strateg-
ic Defense Initiative project and
sides with the National Rifle As-
sociation on gun ownership
policies.

LaRouche said that he liked
Ronald Reagan but feels that he
knew nothing about economics.

For The Pitt News

On the way to his second day
of trial in Washington, ,D.C.,

Oliver North, a born-again Chris- _

tian, took time to talk at a prayer
breakfast ”to pray for America,
the peace of Jerusalem, the na-
tions of the world,” at the annu-
al National Religious
Broadcasters’ convention. \
The prayer breakfasts are or-
ganized by Ed McAteer, president

of the Religious Roundtable, one .

of the bulwarks of the religious
right. The breakfasts generally
feature a prominent public figure
(last year, it was Senator Bob
Dole) with a supporting cast of re-
ligious and secular figures who
have a deep commitment to Is-
rael; they usually include the Is-
raeli ambassador to the United
States (this year, also the Philip-
pine and South African ambas-
sadors), one or two heads of
Jewish organizations_ and the
president of the NRB, Dr. Ben
Armstrong. V

Believing that Israel represents
the fulfillment of Biblical prophe-
cy and that ”God -blesses those
that bless lsrael,” Christian fun-
damentalists are among Israel's
most loyal supporters.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, February 6, 1989

South African leader P.W. Botha may beretiring

JOHANNESBURG, South Afri-
ca (AP) — Newspapers Sunday
said President P.W. Botha, who
stepped down as leader of the rul-
ing party last week, may retire
soon.

Botha, who suffered a stroke
Jan. 18, resigned Thursday as
head of the National Party and
was replaced the same day by
National Education Minister 'F.W.
de Klerk, who is considered
Botha’s heir apparent as
president.

Botha said he will stay on as
president, but he has appointed
Constitutional Development
Minister Chris Heunis as acting
president while he recuperates.

Doctors say the 73-year-old
Botha is making a rapid recovery
but will need at least another
month before he can consider

' returning to work.

Botha was not present for the
opening of Parliament in Cape
Town on Friday and has not been
participating in the government's
day-to-day operations, officials
have said.

The Sunday Times, the coun-
try's largest paper, said in a front-
page story that Botha’s decision
to step down as partychief ”is a
prelude to complete withdrawal
from public life.’’ '—""““‘“

The newspaper, citing uniden-
tified sources within the Nation-
al Party, said Botha may retire
”within weeks.”

Bush discusses plan
for S&L with aides

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi-
dent Bush isn't talking publicly

NEWS BRIEFS

about his plan to resolve the sav-
ings and loan crisis, but members
of Congress and industry officials
say they have a pretty good idea
of what it's likely to include._
Bush met Saturday at Camp
David, Md., with top advisers to
go over their recommendations.

' He plans to reveal his decisions

before Thursday when he
delivers a nationally televised
speech to Congress.

Industry officials and members
of Congress who have spoken
with the Treasury Department
predict the plan will feature these
elements:

—— Borrowing, in the form of

T bonds, of up to $90 billion over

the next several years. Congress’
General Accounting Office
recommends spending $85 bil-

lion over three years.

— A mixture of income
sources, including taxpayer dol-
lars and insurance premiums
from S&Ls and banks, to pay the
$7 billion to $9 billion in interest
on the bonds.

— An administrative reshuffling
that would include a separate ap-
paratus to sell off insolvent S&Ls,
a recapitalized insurance fund for
healthy S&Ls and a regulatory
agency. I

”Western civilization,” he said,
”rests on the U15. and its values."

Deploring the fact that the
values of our forefathers have
come into question in recent de-
cades, he urged a return to the
wisdom of Jefferson and Madi-
son. He wants to see a govern-
ment which promotes the general
welfare but not the welfare state.

North cautioned against wel-
coming the embrace of Gor-
bachev and accepting glasnost at
face value, pointing out that the
gulags are still open, democracy
is non—existent in the Baltic region
and that the Soviet Union will still
have great military superiority
even after the reductions Cor-
bachev has promised.

the answer?

‘Foreign T.A.s should
speak better English

' Inthe land of education, students expect the best.
possible educators their money can buy. As Pitt's tu-
ition steadily increases each year, so should the qual-

Unfortunately, that isn’t the case.

The problem here is with teaching assistants — spe-
cifica|ly,.,foreign T.A.s. Pitt, it seems, is content to al-
low T.A.s who do not have s_ufficient command of
the English language into the classroom, and this is,
without question, a serious problem. How can Pitt
expect its students to get the most out of their educa-
tion when it is frequently difficult to understand the

Atpresent, foreign T.A.'s need only take a single
course in English to qualify to teach, and this can be
taken at the same time they are also teaching under-
graduates. Odd — how can someone who is learn-

' ing English be expected to instruct in English?

The Student Government Board is drawing up a
proposal that would make it mandatory for T.A.s to,
finish the course and demonstrate proficiency in En-
glish before they are allowed to teach. A good idea,
but this should have happened a long time ago.

The departments at Pitt which use T.A‘.s owe it to
their students to _not only pick T.A.s with the best
grasp of the subject to be taught but also with the
best ability to convey it to a student. How can a stu-
dent ask a question if he won't beable to understand

During a visit by President Rea-
gan to the Soviet Union last year,

Qthe former U.S. leader encoun-

tered some skepticism from our
wonderful, glasnost—supporting
"allies.” A faithful Soviet doctrine
supporter, in a desperate search
for loopholes and faults in our
capitalistic system, asked Ronald
Reagan why there were so many
poor and homeless in the United
States. In reply to this question,
the great American leader
promptly stated the fact that if

you are poor and homeless in the

United States of America, then it's
your own fault. Of course, this
answer outraged all the "talk-
before-you-think" liberals back in
his homeland.

The question is whether or not
Mr. Reagan is correct. In light of
this concept, I'll propose some
methods for the homeless to

remedy their tough situations..
».$Personally, I think the easiest so-

‘ lution for them, is to simplyget up

and find a job, but .th'/; liberals
don't -seem to‘ be -satisfied» with;

 

Alternative solutions

that answer— I really can't figure _

out why. So, I'm going to propose
some solutions.

First of all, why don't these
people do what other lazy Ameri-

cans do and collect welfare? Of
course, in this way, they're still

not giving anything to their coun- '

try, but it sure beats living in the
streets. Besides, welfare might be

the start that they need to begin -
_ their climb up the economic lad-

der. Surprisingly, to collect wel-
fare, the homeless don't'even
need a permanent’ address.
However, to qualify, they must
be under some type of public
housing, which is offered in near-

‘ly all metropolitan areas. Also,
once they are living under these .

conditions, their children can
enter public schools. So, these

people can:.get; free money and»; -

Israel is just defending itself 

In the Jan. 31 issue of The Pitt
News,‘ once again an inaccurate
editorial was printed concerning
the Isreali military policy in [the
West Bank]. Do you sincerely be-
lieve that Israel's military tactics
are "comparable to terrorism"?

When I think of terrorism, I

LETTERS _

think of blowing up schoolhouses
full of children and highjacking
or bombing TWA jets. Israel does
not perform these atrocities. 
Second, you printed that "Israel
finds itself practicing the same
oppression which historically led
to the need for its own exis-

* tence." Maybe I haven't watched

the news lately, but has Israel re-
cently slaughtered 6 million inno-
cent people? Iffit hasn't, it's not
the same oppression.

Third, although, as you stated,
”the rubber—covered and plastic
bullets the Israelis are using have
frequently been fired at close
range and have proven to be as
lethal as the real thing,” why do
you think they are being shot at
such close range? Let's see,
maybe it's because the Palestini-
ans are also at close range, armed
with just as lethal weapons such

housing — why don't they take
advantage of this? What more can

. our government give them?

Once these people areson wel-
fare, they meet the lower eco-
nomic income level they need to

' satisfy eligibility requirements for

financial aid. And who says these
people can't go to college? Of
course‘ they're probably not, at
this point in their life, qualified to
be accepted to a university.
However, nobody ever said that
they had to start from the top.
They can always ‘apply to a junior
college, where academic accep-

. tance standards are lower.

Don't think it's possible for the
homeless to do any of the things
I've mentioned so far? Then how
about the military? Sure, they
need at least a General Education
Diploma to get-in, but most com-
munities offer preparatory
coursesfor the GED (which, from
what I've heard, .isn’t much of a
mind-boggling test anyway).

I find it extrememly disturbing
that The Pitt'News always takes
the side of the terrorists and agiti-
a'tors of the Middle East and has
never actually written something
shedding Israel in the positive
light it deserves. There is one
more point that still confuses me.
If the Arab nations waged a war
against Israel and Israel won fair
and square, why should they give
any of that land (West Bank) back
to the aggressors? They shouldn't!

Is homelessness a social. disease?

Editor's note: This letter is in
response to William Young's
column, ”The search for reali-
ty/Who are the homeless?" in the
Feb. 2 edition of The Pitt News.

[...] The homeless want to be
homeless? True. A very small per-
centage do live on the street by
choice. A much larger percen-
tage, however, do not live on the
street by choice. Mr.Young asks,
”What human being does not
know at least one other human

their country, and it does look
good on a job application. .The
military also has the GI Bill. With
this bill the military pays a hefty
portion of a veteran's college tu-
ition. Additionally, these people
could make a career of the mili-
tary, from which they could retire
after 20 years of service and col-
lect a nice pension with good
benefits. %

Liberals always think that we
should send more food and
money to the homeless, but that
won't solve the problem. During
the inauguration,’ thousands of
homeless from the Washington,
D.C., area were provided with
chicken soup. Is it possible that
these same people will be lined
up at the next inauguration
screaming for roast duck?

.The libera|'s concept of throw-
ing money at a problem isn't go-
i ngto work — the poor can only
help themselves. Just watch: the
homeless of today will ‘be, the-—.

sarily mean to care. Homeless fa- }_

tion and is currently the fastest

growing catagory. Whom does? ‘ z 
the homeless family turn to? How   

many human beings . do you
know with the resources to sup-
port your family during a period
of transition? .

As for organizations, organiza- . I

SGB investigates VCR rental service in residence halls

By Stephanie Myers
Staff Writer

A proposed plan providing
VCR rentals for residence halls
— looks promising according to Jill
Phillips,~ Student Government
Board member, who is presently
working with Gerry Kowalski of
the Office of Residence Life on
the project.

At the SGB meeting last Thurs-
day, Phillips said she is not sure
when the university will get the
units, or if the plan has been ap-
proved.

Phillips explained that a lot of
work and contacting still has to

 
 

be completed. She said, ’’I have
yet to speak with Mary Cacali and
Linda Perkins from housing about
the duties of the desk attendants
concerning these rentals.”

Phillips said that there once
was a VCR—rental location at the
Concourse Center in the William
Pitt Union, but it was discon-
tinued for an unspecified reason.

The board is presently working
on the" Urban 13 project.,_,For this
project, the 5GB membe‘r‘§"of Pitt
will host SGB members from
other universities similar in en-
vironment to Pitt.

These representatives will dis-
cuss similarities and differences
among the_schools, and they also

plan to share opinions and ideas.
Urban 13 has been extended
from 13 universities to 26. ”The
reason for this expansion is to
broaden our areas of perspective
and increase information,” said
Julie Shepard, one of the mem-
bers working on Urban 13.
The program will involve infor-
mal round-table discussions with
representatives from the various
student government boards.
Some of the topics of discus-
sion will be housing, campus
safety, financial aid and parking.
The tentative dates are Aug. 3-5
of this summer.

Shorter  
continues

3 to shine

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

At the beginning of the season,
Pitt forward Brian Shorter said he
was_ looking forward to the games
against Big East foes. '

Halfway through that part of
the schedule (nine games, Pitt is

4-5), Shorter is averagingjust over I

18 points, 10 rebounds and 34
minutes a game. He is, right now,
Pitt's most dominant player.

”I think I can do better than I
have been doing,” Shorter said.

' “I know that everybody says that,

but I really believe it. I know
what I can do, and I know I have
to do it.” __ I

Shorter sat out last season as a
victim of the NCAA’s Proposition
48, but that was last year. Now,
he just wants totalk about this
year. »

”All of that is behind me now,
I just want to concentrate on‘play-

ééing,” the 6-foot-6, 235—pounder

said.

And playing he has been. The
Panthers have played 20 games
(11-9). In 10 of those games,
Shorter has been both the high
scorer and high rebounder (in-
cluding last Saturday's 103-80
loss to Syracuse). He scored 37
against Oklahoma and had 20 re-
bounds against Northwestern for

 his season highs.

’_’Through the‘ last -1-5 games,
Brian has been our most consis-

tent player/g’, Pittguard ‘Jason Mat-T _

- The Panthers’ Brian Shorter (00) and Syracuse's Billy Owens (30) are two highly touted Big East rookid;
these games can really help us -

thews said.

It has been Shorter’s play that
helped Pitt beat four top 10 teams
so far this season. The only bad
thing has been that some of Short-

’ er’s bigger games have been hid-

den by Panther losses.

Against Providence (96-81),
Shorter scored 24 and pulled
down 16 rebounds. Against Vil-
lanova (79-78), Shorter had 19
points and seven boards. Against
Syracuse last Saturday, Shorter
pumped in 28 points and
grabbed nine rebounds against a
much taller team. '

”That does bother me a little

- bit,” Shorter said. ’_’It gets a. little
frustrating_ sometimes, _-because

later in the season. It is up to
everybody to do the best they can
as well. When that doesn't hap-
pen, we lose the game.”

As a result of the numbers that
he has been putting up, Shorter
feels that the team is starting to
rely on him more and more. That
is the way Shorter likes it, though.

’’I do feel a little bit of extra
pressure because the guys-are
looking at me a little more,"
Shorter said. ”I just can't let it
bother me. I knew coming in that

Syracuse gives Pitt a

hard time

in 103-80 2

loss at Civic Arena...

By Matt Martin

Sports. Fglitor

Pitt basketball coach Paul
Evans needed no prodding after
the Panthers’ belittling 103-80
defeat at the hands of the Syra-
cuse Orangemen Saturday after-
noon at the Civic Arena.

”We didn't get a very good
game from a whole lot of peo-
ple,” Evans said. A crowd of
16,669 and a national viewing
audience via CBS can attest to
that.

The Panthers were unquestion-
ably outmatched. When Syra-
cuse, ranked 14th by the
Associated Press, plays as it did
Saturday, nearly any team in the
country would have been.

The Orangemen shot 70.0 per-
cent from the field (81.5 percent
in the first half) to the Panthers’
40.6 percent, hit on 11 of their
last 14 free throws, out-
rebounded the Panthers 38-29
and executed the fast break to
perfection, among other things.

The loss dropped the Panthers,
now straining to make the NCAA

_ 64-team Tournament, _to 11-9

overall, 4-5 and sixth place in the
Big East. '

Syracuse improved to 19-4 and
5-4 in the conference, breaking a

confidence with each game. As I
gain confidence, the team will
depend on me more. That's the
way I like it.” ’

By now, Shorter should be

used to the extra pressure. As a '

three-year starter at Simon Gratz
High School in Philadelphia
(Shorter transferred to’Oak Hill
Academy for his senior year),
Shorter scored 1,869 points, aver-
aging 31 points and 15 rebounds.

Former Pitt assistant coach John
Calipari (now Massachusetts"
head coach) said,‘ ”Brian_was the.

,best ninth-grade player-. I've ever.’ .

Bausmith was also the top Pan-
ther on the high bar, scoring
8.85. Pollaci and MacBeth fol-
lowed closely behind, with
scores of 8.65 and 8.55.

”Our high bar and parallel bars
are looking better,” said D’Ami-
co. ”Our overall score was sur-
prising. We scored what we have
been, even though we're hurting.

”Our execution still needs

help. Our guys have to do the
sets. I'm going to keep changing
the lineup until we find the mag-

ic mark.”

Pollaci, this year's team cap-
tain, finished with a score of
52.15 in the all—around competi-
tion, which is a season high for

him.

”Pat did a fine job for us~to-
day,” said D’Amico. ’’I’d never
guess that he'd be where he is to-

day [because of an ankle injury].

action.

Miller picked up three fouls in
the first half and played only eight
minutes in the second period.

/‘From the point guard position
today, I don't think we played a
good game,” said guard Jason
Matthews, who contributed 18
points, 12 on three-point shots.

’’I thought our guards were flat,
and that was suprising,” added
Evans.

Particularly surprising, con-
sidering it was the guards who
led Pitt to an 81-76 upset victory

’’I don't think any of us were
lax or anything like that. We just

The Orangemen got double-

Evans applauded Douglas’
play.

”Sherman’s playing much bet-
terthan he did the first time_we
saw him,” Evans said. ”[He]
could be one of the best in the
country.”

Most of Douglas’ assists came
on alley-oop passes to Coleman,
Thompson, Owens and freshman
forward David Johnson.

”Sherman has been playing
great all year,” said Boeheim.
”He makes the plays for us.
When Coleman and Owens got
into foul trouble, he took over the
offense for us.”

Douglas scored 15 of his points
after the 10-minute mark of the
second half, when Coleman and
Owens were on the bench with
four fouls each.

But the game was over long be-

Orangemen jumped out to a 4-0
lead before Martin converted two
free throws at 18:49 of the first

Syracuse stretched its lead to
eight, 21-13, at 11:41 on an
Owens foul shot, and then was

only lead of the game.

But Syracuse went on an 8-0
run, getting six points from

momentum and silence a sud-

Coleman hit both free throws,

The Panthers seemed lifeless af-

Lady Panthers shot down by Connecticut

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

Pitt's women's basketball team
got more than it could handle this
past weekend, bowing to the first-
place team in the Big East, Con-
necticut, by a score of 77-63 in
an afternoon game played at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

The Huskies used tenacious
defense and a hot first-half shoot-
ing streak to send Pitt reeling ear-
ly on, as the hosts dropped to
10-11 overall (3-8 in the Big East).
Connecticut solidified its Confer-
ence lead, improving to 16-5

(8-2).
’’I think this was one of those
games that we had nothing to
lose and everything to gain,”
Lady Panther head coach Kirk
Bruce said aften/vard. ”We’re at
the bottom of the Big East, and
they're at the top, and we just felt
that this was a good opportunity
for us to really make a move.”
But Connecticut center Kerry
Bascom made sure that Pitt re-
mained in the second division of
the Big East for at least another
game, as she shot a scintillating
10 of 12 from the field (including
a six-for-seven day from beyond

the three-point line), on the way
to racking up a game-high 31
points from the field.

The Huskies also helped their
cause tremendously by holding
Pitt forward Lorri Johnson, who
came into the game averaging
25.6 points and 8.5 rebounds a
contest, to an unusually low 15
points and five boards.

Pitt hung tough with the visitors
early on, as both squads battled
to a 10-10 tie early on. Lady Pan-
ther guard Jennifer Shingler car-
ried her team early on, scoring six
points in the first five minutes of
the contest on two 18-foot jum-

From there the Huskies seemed
to turn up their defense a notch,
while simultaneously freeing Bas-
com for wide-open jumpers.

Connecticut went on a 33-20
run to close out the half, and in
the process allowed Johnson to
score only four points in the first
20 minutes, including only one
basket during the key run.

’’I didn't feel really bad about
being down 13 at the half,”
Bruce said. ”The reason for that
is I felt we played pretty good
defense in the first half, other than
a couple of transition situations

that we didn't cover. There was
still 20 minutes to go, and with
a three-pointer here or there and
good defense, 1 felt we could
sneak back into the game.”

Indeed, the Lady Panthers did
methodically battle their way
back in the second half, probably
in no small part due to the resur-
gence of Johnson.

After Connecticut’s- Wendy Da-
vis nailed a 16-foot jumper mid-
way through the second-half to
give her team a-59-46 lead, the
Lady Panthers scored the next six
points to climb to within seven.

Johnson opened the rally with
a score underneath. On the next
trip downcourt, 6-foot-4 Pitt
center Connie Hurt did her share
of damageinside, as she tickled
the twine to seemingly begin to
bring the home team back into
the contest.lPitt’s Shaunda Byrd
completed the run with a 17-foot
jumper to get the Lady Panthers
to 59-52.

At that point, however, Con-

necticut called a timeout, as '

Huskie Coach Geno Auriemma
attempted to settle his squad
down and avoid a major upset on
the road.

That strategy apparently
worked, as the Huskies seized

control of the contest from that

point on and walked out of Pitts-
burgh with a 14-point victory.
Bascom hit a 17-foot jumper
and a three-point shot to spark
her team on the way to the deci-
sive 10-2 run ’
”We kind of felt that if we

' would have followed through

with our game plan in the second

' half that we could have done 
lot better,” Bruce stated. ”We di

get it down to seven by doing the
things that we're Capable of
doing. . .—.— .

”We were able to get the ball
inside on offense, and therﬁwhen
we didn't have anything, ’we
were able to open it up from the
outside. ' .

’’It seems like once they called
timeout when we got down by

seven‘ and then hit a couple of&' '

three—pointers that we kind of had

our backs broken a little bit.”
Johnson and Shingler each

scored 15 points to pace theiLady

-- Panthers on the day. Connie Hurt
‘ was the only other Pitt player in

double figures, as she scored 1 1.

Meanwhile Shingler piled up "six A
assists to add to her impressive .

day.
