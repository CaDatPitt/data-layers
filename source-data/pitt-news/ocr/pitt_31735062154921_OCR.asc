Speaker Harrington
To~Answer Commie
"In Series Tomorrow

The YM—YWCA World Per-
spective Series will bring to

campus Michael Harrington,

a spokesman for the World
Socialist Movement, who will
discuss Democratic Socialism.
He will lecture at noon tomorrow
in G24 Cl. An informal discus-
sion will be held jn the SU
Lounge at 3 p.m.

“As. a socialist b I was deeply
disturbed to hear that the repre-
sentative of the Communist Party
who spoke at Pitt described the
totalitarian Russian system as be-
ing Socialist,” Harrington com-
mented.

He added, “I will show that
Russian and Chinese Communists
have nothing in common with,
Democratic Socialism, and that
Democratic Socialism offers the
best-real alternative tothe dicta-

torship of Communism on the one
hand and the recessions and in-
justices of capitalism on the

’ other.’’

Harrington is a member of
the Executive committee of the
Young Peoples Socialist League,
the youth section of the Social-
ist Party, and the American
affiliate of the International Un-
ion of Socialist Youth.

He was the personal assistant to
‘John Cogley in his work on the

book “Blacklisting,” a study’ of
employment practices in radio,
television, ‘theatre, and the movies
during the McCarthy period. He is
currently the editor of “Anvil?

. and a contributing editor of “Dis-
went” and “commonweal.”

MacLeish - Poet, Statesman, Schola1'

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

In’ 1923, a young man decided
to take his family to France and
attempted to make a living by be-
ing a poet. He was just one of
many young Americans who fled
America in the twenties to ﬁnd
perspective and acceptance on the
continent. ‘ .

Many who took this great gam-
ble with their futures, who risked
all that was known and certain
for a dream of fulﬁllment, were
doomed to failure and disillusion.
They were no more artists abroad
than they were in their native
land. But this “lost generation’
of that decade (1920-1930) had its
successes, the men who found
themselves, artistically and intel-
lectually, once away from hime.

That adventurer, who in 1923
turned expatriate to France, suc-
ceeded marvelously 'while others

write strong, beautiful lyrics and
published his ﬁrst volume of verse
in 1924. ‘His plans had jelled, the
dream had been realized. Archi-

unique career in American letters.
Unhappy in Law

Educated at Hotchkiss and Yale,
MacLeish entered Harvard Law
School in 1916 (“to avoid going to
work"), after having served in
the First World War. After prac-
ticing law for awhile and being
unhappy in it, he packed up his
family and went to the continent.

There he wrote poetry, studied
the French poets, and Eliot and
Pound. Back in the U. S. in
1928, he continued to turn out
for publication subjective, high-
ly original, rhythmic verse. _In
1932 he went to Mexico to fol-
low the route of the conqueror
Hernando Cortez.

The narrative poem, “Conquis-
tador,” a re-telling of the con-
quest, won the Pulitzer Prize for
poetry in that year. His ﬁrst col-
“Poems, 1924-1933,” es-
tablished him as one of the coun-
try’s distinguished writers.

Man of Action _

MacLeish was a great deal more
than-a poet. The man of action
ry__ much 3:‘.-pav1:t‘of ‘

 

the social and political upheavals

which marked the Thirties. He
became an articulate, and ﬁery
spokesman for freedom and jus-
tice in the years which were noted
for the scarcity of those commodi-
ties. \ —
In a verse-picture narrative,
“America Was Promises,” he
portrayed the plight of the op-
pressed farmer who heard that
this was a land of plenty, but
saw only famine and squalor.
“The American Cause,” .“The
American Story,” “The Fall of a
City,” a verse drama for radio,
were other expressions of his dis-
satisfaction with contemporary
society. Naturally, his vigorous
political works made him a con-
troversial ﬁgure, a position he
seemed to relish. ~
Against Ivory Tower»
Ma‘cLeish condemned the writ-
ers of the Thirties who refused
to leave the Ivory Tower and

speak out for the truth as they‘

saw it. In an essay, ,“The Irre-

sponsibles,' MacLeish, lashed the. ,.

of the New Deal.

When Franklin Roosevelt ap-
pointed him Librarian of Con-
gress in 1939, the_ professional
librarians of the nation and the
wolf pack which saw Roosevelt
as a tyrant were up in verbal
arms. He held the position, with
distinction, until 1944, when he
resigned to become Assistant
Secretary of State. . _

He held the post for about a
year, until -the war was con-

United States’ role in UNESCO
and attended the opening meetings
in Paris.

Teaches Writing n

In .1949, MasLeish returned to
the academic life "after too long
an hiatus. Harvard offered him
the Boylston professorship of
rhetoric and oratory. (The title
means he teaches creative writ-
ing-.) With his acceptance of the
position, MacLeish nearly came

satile intellectual career.

The new role as teacher gave
him much time for his. own
work: His magniﬁcent, “Collect-
ed Poems,«l917-1952,” "won an-
other Pulitzer Prize, the National
Book» Award, and Yale’s Bol-
lhgen Prize in 1953.~ Richard
Eberhart "called it, “a major
achievement in American let-
ters.”

 Seek Work

Of Writers

Two New York Publishing
houses are seeking the work
of promising young writers
studying at the University.

In a search for new talent
and promising ﬁrst novels, G.
P. Putnam.’s Sons and Doubleday
have requested Professor Edwin
Peterson, professor of English and
director of courses in creative
writing, to submit the partial or

complete novel manuscripts of
his students. .
The University is ‘the only

school selected to participate ‘in
-Doub1eday’s program and is. in-
with only Columbia University in
G. P. Putnam’s Sons’ invitation.

Both publishing houses have
made similar oﬁers. These in-
clude an option payment against
ﬁrst refusal of a publishing con-
tract, editorial assistance in
completion of the novel, and
-consideration. of Peterson’s rec-
ommendation in selection of the
manuscripts. -

Both publishers have also indi— .

cated willingness to read five or
six manuscripts submitted by
June. All manuscripts must, how-
ever, be submitted through Peter-
son’s oﬁice to be considered for
this plan. ‘

Roll-A-Matic shaving obsoletes them

than just a monetary ﬁgure.
One cannot price a diamond
by size alone. There are over
20 other factors involved be-
sides carat weight. There is
only one thing all diamonds
can have in common and that
is" size. Nothing else! ! After
size,-consider Color, Perfec-
tion and Cut. There are 7
colors ranging from top white
(blue-white) to yellow. There
are nine degrees of perfec-
tion and numerous types of
ﬂaws. Then remember that
the polished diamond is man-

-in selecting a diamond,

proportioned stone, expertly
cut, will give the maximum
brilliance. HOVVEVER buying

The days of going for long rides in sleek convertibles and lying.
around on the Cathedral lawns are here. The Pirates open tomorrow
the season that will see them ﬁnally winning the National League
pennant after 32 years. Mid-terms are over and only. two more months
of school remain. Russia still hasn’t sent anyone to the moon or at-
tacked the United States.

Everything’s just lovely. So why be nasty, I asked‘ myself." On
second thought why step out of character? Don’t go softy now.
There’s enough nastiness left in youto say some more nasty things-

about some more unsuspecting people. That’s‘also what I told my-

self, and that sounded more like ms. Thus, I will be nasty.

J First on, today’s list is the “Prez” of the Pittsburgh Steeler
football club, Arthur J. Rooney. I’ve never met Mr. Rooney, but
from what I read about him in the papers he’s probably a nice
3113- ‘

Whether he is or not is unimportant. It’s the type of businessman-

_ he is that interests me at this moment. Before the 1958 football season,.

everyone—-‘including Prez Rooney—was concerned with convincing
Pitt to permit the Steelers to use the Stadium. ‘

Acting very civic-mindedly, Chancellor Litchﬁeld and the Uni-

versity signed a ﬁve—year agreement taking care of this matter. Then
after the season was over, the_ Steeler boss decided _that.h'e had to get
back down the hill to Forbes Field. " '

There are too many drawbacks to the Stadium: the hill, too
hard to scale,'keeps people away; the rain also deters the; specta-
tors from appearing at‘ Steeler games because none of the seats
are covered; the seats don't have backs on them.

Did Mr. Rooney discover only last season that these consequences
went along with playing in the Stadium? He’s been in Pittsburgh quite
a .number of years, and he’s surely seen football at the Stadium a
number of times — -

Did he think that the hill would-level out, the rain would
stop and the seats would automatically acquire backs just because
his Steelers were going to play there? I give Mr. Rooney credit
for more brains than this. I -

The move to the Stadium was‘ a ﬁnancial ﬂop. The pro gridders,
in one of their_,better seasons in recent years, drew one of their low—'

, est totals in attendance. Naturally, they wanted out. And once again,

civic-minded Pitt made everyone happy by releasing the Steelers from
the contract. I ‘

.But just let civic-minded Pitt propose something, such ‘as ex-
pansion, and the citizens of the city are shocked and areextremely

A dogmatic againstit. For some reason, I can’t see that the relationship

between the" city and the University is on a 50-50 basis.
* * * * * -
One of themajor items of interest about the city's future Munic-
ipal Stadium is the seating capacity[ I have nothing against the de-

cision of the chancellor and the Board of Trustees. The facts j_ustiﬁed

the action. . ' = I , g
However, there is one.point that.» was included in- Dr. Litchﬁeld’s

A report to the Board that seems further out than Pitt Stadium’s center

ﬁeld would have been. The chancellor states that both the Pirates and
Steelers “are emphatic in their opposition to playing in ‘a stadium
with a capacity of much in excess of 50,000. 0
“They state that they would rather play‘in a smaller stadium
at the expense of losing some attendance occasionally than regu-
larly in a stadium which could be only partially filled.”

This statement, I must confess,

c In Game Conditions

B3! ‘LARRY HAGGERTY
For the past three or four
seasons the Panther baseball
teamihas been hampered by
rain, wet ‘grounds, and cold
weather during the initial
stages of the campaign. This

year hag proven to be no excep-
tion. ,

“We thought that the weather-
man might give us a break during
our trip down‘ South last week,

but darned if it didn't rain on

three of .the~four days, and we
had to cancel our games with
Quantico and Georgetown," said a
water-logged Bobby Lewis,’the
Jungle Cat‘ skipper.»

The Panthers had only four
days practice at the Wildwood
diamond before departing on
their three game road trip.
What little work that they play-
ers got in was accomplished in
the Field House.

,-“This.should be the ﬁnest col-
lection of pitchers that ‘I have

had much of a chance to show
what they can do under actual
game conditions because of this
lousy rain,” declared Lewis.
Composing the Panther’s
crack mound corps are right-
handers Bill Hamilton, one of-
the co-captains, John Reichen-
bach, Dick Wirth, Bob Conti,
Lauren Guthrie, Jim Walsh,
Dan Swanson and Dick Wis-
niewski with Bob Shearervbeing
Lewis’s only southpaw twirler.
The catching situation is being
taken care of by Fred (Yogi) De-
Lost, co-captain of this year’s
team and the number one receiver
for the past two seasons. He is
considered a. ﬁne handler of
pitchers. His number one replace-
ment is Fred Laningham.
Hamilton and Conti have been
nominated by Lewis to face the
California State Teachers in a
doubleheader at California, Pa.,
this Saturday.

trials will get underway at 1
p.m. while the ﬁnals are sched-
uled to start at 7 .p.m.

The three lifts in the .meet» are
the‘ press, snatch and clean and

will rate each contestant’s lift.
The‘ heaviest lift will ‘count in
each event with each entrant be-
ing permitted three attempts in
his specialty. , ‘ .

In the press there are two dis-
tinct movements. The ﬁrst is
bringing the weight from the floor
to the chest while the second
move is to lift the weight over the
head after acquiring the signal
from ‘one of the three olﬁcials to
do so.

The snatch has one motion
which is’ to bring the weight
from the ﬂoor to an arm’s
length over the head without
pausing. ‘In the clean and jerk
a contestant is allowed to use all
parts of his ' body in’ pressing
the weight over his head.
