Undergrad
business
school sites
considered

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

At least four possible sites are
being discussed for the upcoming
construction of Pitt’s new undergrad-
uate business school.

Anna Guzman, director of
Facilities Planning at Pitt, highlighted
some of the proposed sites for the
new Undergraduate College of
Business Administration at yester-
day’s meeting of South Oakland
community organization, Oakland
Directions Inc. planning and trans-
portation committee.

The most viable option for devel-
opers, according to Guzman, is the
construction of a building on the hill-
side along Joncaire Street next to
Mervis Hall.

Guzman said the proposed site
would not interfere with any existing
structures and would leave the
wooded area adjacent to Joncaire
Street intact.

“[The proposal] offers a lot more
possibilities  this building would
frame the ‘green space,” Guzman
said. “It’s a lot more of an acceptable
solution.”

Guzman said the site would also
allow for 90 parking spaces to be
located under the building.

Planners also submitted a proposal
to build an extension from the top of
Mervis Hall across Roberto Clemente
Drive to Forbes Quadrangle, but
finding sufficient parking near the
school could be difficult.

“There is really no way we could
put whatever parking would be
required for this building within the
building structure,” Guzman said.
“The parking would have to be locat-
ed within a 1,000 foot area of the
building itself.”

Guzman also said steel trusses that
would be needed to support the

Day Against Apartheid observed hy students

Jennifer Sikora
Staff Writer

A moment of silence hushed those gath-
ered in the William Pitt Union Ballroom
last night after Students For a Free South
Africa opened their meeting with a liba-

tion for 13 people reportedly killed recent-

ly in South Africa.

“It’s not enough to be angry,” said SFSA
President Thurston Winbush. “It’s about
doing something with that anger, coming
up with constructive changes.” People
must learn to break down the barriers of
what and who is seen as an enemy,
Winbush said at the event, which was held
in observance of the United Nation’s
International Day Against Apartheid.

“Nobody is born prejudiced. Prejudice is
a part of the socialization process,” said
speaker Mongezi S. Nkomo, a native South
African. Racism could be better under-
stood by looking at economic and social
structures, according Nkomo.

“The capitalist system encourages greed,
envy and competition,” Nkomo said.
Racism in the United States and South
Africa became a means to justify power
and the economic process of capitalism.

“Culture is a product of social relations
of empowerment,” Nkomo said. “When
we look at prejudice, it’s a product of dis-
crimination. But discrimination is not
wrong in itself.”

He said people discriminate every day,
such as deciding to eat red meat instead of

fish for dinner.

Nkomo said myths are created when a
person or group feels threatened by the
abilities of another. “We need to challenge
the way we look at relations between each
other  In order to struggle against
racism, tribalism and global oppression,
we need empathy and good will.”

He said principles of religion are often
used to justify oppression. “We need to
fight against religion that is used like a
drug  there are people who defend capi-
talism with the Bible.”

Nkomo said as capitalism works its way
into South Africa, many people will not be
poor because of racism but because of the
economic system.

Pitt says
cancer
research
results
still valid

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The Pitt—based National Surgical
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
has released a statement support-
ing chair Dr. Bernard Fisher’s find-
ings which declared a 1985
research study valid despite
flawed data.

According to the NSABP, the
women included in the study and
those who have been treated as a
result of it “can be assured of
the appropriateness of their thera-
pY-’’ ,

Dr. Fisher, a researcher at Pitt,
announced the results of his inves-
tigation into the breast cancer
study on Monday. He said that
when the flawed data is excluded,
the conclusions of the study
remain valid.

However, since Monday there
has been a storm of national atten-
tion questioning the study
which had a major impact on
breast cancer treatment in the
United States.

The study, published in The Neui
England‘/ozirnal of Medicine,
helped convince many in the med-
ical field as well as the general
public that the removal of the
entire breast is not always neces-
sary to treat breast cancer success-
fully.

According to the study, radiation
treatments following the removal
of only the lump in the breast
result in the same survival rates as
when the breast is removed com-
pletely.

In February 1991, however,
NSABP determined there was mis-
conduct involving Dr. Roger
Poisson of St. Luc Hospital in
Montreal, who was one of the
study’s researchers.

Allegedly, falsified reports were
identified in more than 100 of Dr.
Poisson’s patients. -

The matter was referred to the
United States Public Health
Service’s Office of Research
Integrity which confirmed, after
a two—year investigation, that
Dr. Poisson’s research in the study
was ﬂawed.

According to the NSABP, they
conducted “multiple reanalyses” of
Dr. Poisson’s research and found
there was no change in the NSABP
published findings.

In addition, federal officials from
the American Cancer Society and

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 17, 1994

Low self esteem hinders one’s ability to change

In my last column I wrote that
many of us get “stuck” in our
lives in a variety of ways. We
are unhappy and want to find a
new direction for ourselves but
we find it difficult to do so. To
some extent this is because we
have come to believe that
change is painful and some-
thing » to be feared.
Consequently we resist, avoid
and block change in a multi-
tude of ways.

We construct elaborate barri-
ers to protect ourselves from
the pain we believe change
would bring us. One of the
most powerful internal obsta-
cles to change is low self-
esteem. If we do not value our-
selves then we are not likely to
believe that we deserve a better
life.

it is the voice within us that
says “no you can’t,” “you are
not good enough,” “you are not
smart enough,”“you are not
pretty enough,” and so you had
better just settle for the life you

have.
Low self—esteem damages us
in many ways. It makes us

underestimate our capabilities
and fear the exposure of our
real self. It also helps sustain
our self—fulfilling negative
expectations and often traps us
in an endless cycle of despair.
Low self—esteem usually has
its roots in early childhood
experiences. If we lived in an
atmosphere that was character-
ized by excessive criticism from
significant people in our lives

 

or if we lived in a family filled
with domestic violence, alco-
holism or abuse, then we are
likely to reach adulthood with a
damaged view of ourselves.

As adults, however, we are
capable of recovering from this
early damage and developing a
better self view. We need to
fight the fear that changing will
only make things worse and
open our minds to the possibili-
ty that we can develop a more
accepting view of self.

Seeking some professional
counseling is one way of
addressing this problem but
there is also a lot you can do on
your own. For example, one
strategy for building self—esteem
is to find models or mentors
who seem to be happy with
their lives and who demonstrate
positive self-esteem by the
behavior they exhibit. These
people are all around us and
they are not necessarily the best
looking, the slimmest, the
smartest or the most athletic.

They are, however, people who
use what they have in creative
and positive ways.

Find these people and study
them. Try to understand what
traits they have or how they
think about things that make
them happier and more accept-
ing of themselves. Most of our
own behavior and ways we
think about things were learned
from other people, but when
we were younger we didn’t
have much to say about who
the significant people were in
our lives.

Now you are capable of
choosing your own models. I
recommend that you do this
and not be afraid to begin prac-
ticing some of those behaviors
that you observe in these peo-
ple that you admire.

-I have written before that a
good way of becoming a suc-
cessful student is by imitating
one. I think that the advice
holds for a lot of other mea-
sures of success as well.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, March 17, 1994

Professors,
students
bridge  
social gap
with club

ByJ.M. Gonzalez
For The Pitt News

For the various English majors
and faculty there is one place
where both can meet. Pitt’s
Undergraduate English Club
allows English majors to meet
the faculty on a more social
level.

The English Club “takes down
the barriers of college,” said
senior Ron Murphy, co-chair of
the group.

“It fosters a relationship
between the teachers and stu-
dents on an academic level,”
said Murphy. “You can talk to
teachers as peers.”

The English Club organized
the second undergraduate poet-
ry reading at Hemingway’s yes-
terday.

It is part of Hemingway’s
poetry reading series in which
usually only graduate, faculty
and local writers participate.

The reading was arranged by
Anna Henderson, a senior, who
also read her poetry.

Aside from the undergraduate
poetry reading, the English Club
is trying to assemble a discus-
sion forum to raise awareness
on censorship and perspectives
taken by journalists.

According to Henderson, the
discussion would include cur-
rent censorship involving cam-
pus groups, banned books and
the media. The discussion forum
would tentatively be between
student groups, he said.

In the future, the English Club
will set up a Seminar Day for
English majors to help their
major work for them.

Co-chair Fred Bigelow, a
junior, is organizing a fiction
writing workshop where stu-
dents can critique each other’s
work outside. of the classroom.

The club is also planning a co-
op program between poetry
majors and high schools.

According to Murphy and
Henderson, the program would
involve poetry majors teaching

M poetry workshops.

A trip to Stratford, Ontario,
Canada — a_Shakespearian
town — is also underway.

According to the club’s faculty
advisor, Carol Kayes, the English
Club Was established about
three-and-half years ago to
allow the various undergraduate
English majors to meet each
other.

The group is “both a recre-
ational and an educational
club,” said Henderson.

On the recreational side, the
club sees plays and movies
together because they “provide
a common interest,” said
Murphy. _

The English Club is “goo
because you get to know the
faculty on a really small level,”
said Henderson.

Greek

Continued from page 1
1994's Greek Goddess and God, held last
night in the Soldiers and Sailors War
Memorial.

“I was very, very pleased,” Myers said
after the event. “It was stressful but well
worth it all at the end.”

“I was very honored to represent my
house and I’d like to thank them for sup-
porting me because I couldn’t have done
it without them,” Myers added.

The event, which kicked off 1994
Greek Week, consisted of representatives
from 27 fraternities and sororitites com-
peting for trophies and points towards
Greek Week.

According to Greek Week Overall Chair
Cassi Berarducci, Greek God and
Goddess raised close to $3,000 for Special
Olympics.

“Every contestant must have a $100
sponsor and in return they must incorpo-
rate the sponsors name with their toga
outfit,” Berarducci said.

Some of the acts featured in last night’s
event ranged from Broadway classics like
“The Music of the Night” from Phantom

of the Opera, sung by Nick Sacobs of
Theta Chi, to “The Beer Barrel Polka” per-
formed on the accordion by Mark
Dubravec of Delta Phi.

Contestants were judged by five indi-
viduals who based their decisions on
three categories.

The first is participation, which includes
attendance at meetings and tuming in the
sponsors’ money on time, and is worth 20
percent of the overall score.

The second part is the toga competition
which also counts for 20 percent. “The
toga competition is based on how well
the person incorporates the sponsor into
their toga and how the toga appearance is
overall,” said Greek God and Goddess
Chair JJ. Seiler.

The third and final category, which
counted for the last 60 percent of the
scores, was the talent competition. This
portion of the event was based on how
well the contestants presented themselves
to the audience and how well they per-
formed.

According to several students who
attended the event, some of the partici-

pants performed very well.

“It was awesome,” Nicole Walz said.
“The judging relies more on talent then
on looks. It was better competition than
people might think  each house got to
show off their stuff.”

Pitt junior Tom Bailer said he was
impressed with the level of talent he saw
during the competition. “I thought it was
great,” Bailer said. “The guy from Sigma
Phi Epsilon did a drill team routine that
was exceptional, and the brother who
played the accordion was outstanding.”

Greek Week business manager Kelly
Reddy said she was pleased with the
crowd in attendance last night. “It is a
great honor and I think that is why we
have so many people in the audience
because they truly support the brothers
and sisters who represent them.”

However, some people who attended
last night’s event had some criticism
about the show’s length, which lasted
over four-and-a-half hours. “It was too
long,” student Jim Dockey said. “They
should make it about three hours shorter,
[or] at least get rid of the toga part.”

approximately $4.5 million to
the cost of the building.

“This is a very expensive

An additional proposal sug-
gested constructing a building
next to Mervis Hall where
Mazeroski Field stands and relo-

would require flattening the hill

Guzman said planners gave

to cut into the residentially-

He said the main strug-
gle will not be racism, but
a fight for power and
wealth.

On another topic,
Winbush discussed mis-
education and said
African-Americans are
bombarded with deroga-
tory images from the
moment they start school.

Winbush said older stu-
dents should break down
what they have already
learned and then aim to
reeducate themselves.

Both Winbush and
Nkomo said the media
often misinforms the pub-
lic as well. To help com-
bat misinformation, mem-
bers of Students for Free
South Africa have devel-
oped an internet system
to “hook up” with people
of other countries that
can provide factual infor-
mation quickly.

Known as the
Committee Against
Global Oppression, the
system was formed two
months ago to link anti-
oppression organizations
and individuals world-
wide. .

Winbush said CAGO
has about 200 members
and most of the commu-
nication is done through
electronic mail.

“As I grew older, I
came to understand that
struggle brings about
change,” Winbush said.
“What I’d like to do is talk
to my generation about
internalizing the struggle
 The struggle to us has
taken on a different
meaning.”

sponsors of the original study,
said they supported the ﬁndings
of Dr. Fisher’s reanalysis.

But according to Wednesdays
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, federal
officials from ORI‘ criticized
Fisher for not releasing his
report on the false data sooner,
which addedto public appre-
hension about the accuracy of
the reanalysis.

Fisher responded by saying
federal investigators “nev inti-
mated that there was anﬁ)rob-
lem in terms of delay,” pointing
out that ORI spent two years
investigating the matter them-
selves.

In order to allay fears, the NCI
has commissioned three inde-
pendent statisticians to re-
analyze the effect of the fals-
iﬁed data on the study’s conclu-
sions.

The independent investigators

are expected to give their report
in two weeks.

According to the NSABP, Dr.
Poisson was one of more than
5,000 physicians who participat-
ed in the study which included
484 medical centers and corn-
munity hospitals in North
America.

The NSABP said that if any of
the results would have been
affected by Poisson’s flawed
research, “these findings would
have been made public immedi-
ately.”

At this point, Dr. Fisher has
not released his reanalysis of
the study excluding the falsified
cases.

According to one federal offi-
cial in the The New York Times,
Dr. Fisher is expected. to submit
his own reanalysis of the
data within two weeks to The
New England journal of
Medicine.

than if conventional treatments are used. Now imagine
that that it comes to light that some of the research was
falsified. Can this be tolerated in the life and death
field of medicine, or for that matter in any research that
is supposed to reveal the truth?

This is more than a hypothetical case. It turns out
that results were falsified in a breast cancer study
whose results were published in the New England

journal of Medicine in 1985. One doctor who partici-

pated in the National Surgical and Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project falsified approximately 100 of his cases.
The results of this report are supposedly unaffected by
the data given by this doctor, but so far it has only
been reviewed by people who have been directly asso-
ciated with this project (New Yorle Times).

The research study found that women with breast
cancer who had mastectomies (full breast removal) had
survival rates which were equivalent to those who had
lumpectomies and followed them with radiation thera-
py. This report was published in 1985, and many doc-
tors used thisas a basis for outlining treatment for their
patients. .

In 1991, it finally came out that there were cases
which had been falsified. The Federal Office of
Research Integrity examined the cases for two years.
The fact that research was falsified should have led to
nearly immediate warnings that doctors should have
received. It is important that proper information is used
in diagnosis and treatment of patients. Only now,
according to yesterday’s New Yorle Times, is the
National Cancer Institute appointing three independent
researchers to examine whether these falsified results
may have skewed the data to lead to erroneous con-
clusions.

While anyone can see the importance of examining
the data carefully before setting off alarms that could
lead to panic, it is nevertheless important that as soon
as it is discovered research data has been falsified that
independent groups begin to look at what effect this
data has on the conclusions.

Beyond this fact, there is also the need for proper
procedures for reading and review of research informa-
tion. Although everyone should have a strong sense of
responsibility and should work to maintain intellectual
integrity on their own, some amount of looking over‘
each other’s shoulders should occur in scholarly cir-
cles. This should not only happen in science, where it
is easiest, but also in the humanities and social sci-
ences, where the grey areas that are studied often have
an effect on people which, while it may not be life or
death, is as dear to them as their health.

What can really be

The Allegheny County coroner says while you
were on spring break, five Pittsburghers were
killed by gunfire; two died in car crashes. _

Handguns are about to exceed automobiles as
the leading cause of death amongst consumer
products in this country.

Americans remain paralyzed in an emotional
frenzy over what to do about a terrible public
health problem, death by firearms. Philosophical
protectionism has resulted in failed solutions that
offer only liberal or conservative political cor-
rectness.

The left says, “We need gun control.” The
Violence Policy Center reports there are about
20,000 separate guncontrol laws

percent) were suicides. The fact is that most
handgun deaths are suicides.

Since there is virtually no governmental regu-
lation covering the manufacture of handguns,
and since manufacturers are privately-held cor-
porations, it is difficult to say exactly how many
handguns are made every year. But by using
excise tax figures paid to the federal govern-
ment, it is possible to estimate that the wholesale
value of handguns made in America last year
totalled $386 million. That’s a lot of pistols.

What about our Second Amendment right to
bear arms? Kristen Rand, one of the “Cease Fire”
authors points out that at no time in history has

any gun—control law been

in this country. The right says, “We
need to lock up more criminals.”

and federal level has given us the

tion in the history" of the world.
The result? 35,000 dead from gunﬁre in 1992.

A recently published study from the Violence
Policy Center titled “Cease Fire: A
Comprehensive Strategy to Reduce Firearms
Violence” offers new ideas for dealing with this
devastating pox afflicting American society. If we
really want to solve the gun violence problem,
we need to divorce our thinking from the emo-
tionalism of the debate and coolly consider
some facts, presented in the study:

Crime is not at the heart of gun violence. Of
murders of known circumstance committed in
1992, anonymous killings accounted for only 14
percent of all homicides. Almost half the victims
were either related to or acquainted with their
killer. According to the “Cease Fire” report, the
vast majority of firearms homicides stem from
arguments “turned deadly because of ready
access to a gun.” The crime myth is firmly
debunked by the fact that, of firearms deaths
reported in 1988 (30,565), only 7 percent
(2,179) stemmed from felonious activity.

The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports addresses the
issue of self-defense. Using FBI standards, justi-
fiable homicide by handgun involving private
citizens happened only 262 times in 1992. At
the national level, this means that the ratio of
lives lost due to gunshots vs. justifiable homicide
was 95 to one.

Suicide is a subject ignored by both sides of
the handgun issue. As the Violence Policy Center
report states, the pro-gun lobby brushes the sub-

, ject away by saying that -victims would find a’

way to kill themselves “no matter what.” And,
since only 10 percent of suicide by firearms are
committed with weapons specifically purchased
for that purpose, the anti-gun people ignore the
fact that traditional gun-‘control schemes (back-
ground checks, registration, training, etc.) have
little_effect. In the 1988 statistic, 18,169 (59.5

Rand argued. In 1981, Morton
Grove, Ill. banned the sale and possession of
handguns, period. In every court challenge to
that action, the law was upheld. “States are not
prohibited by the Second Amendment from con-
trolling private ownership of handguns and
other categories of firearms in virtually any way
they see fit,” Rand concluded.

Where do we go from here? Liberal and con-
servative philosophies have both been tried.

What exactly are handguns? They are sport-
ing goods legally available for sale, which have
the potential to be incredibly dangerous. If any
other consumer good caused 35,000 deaths, the
federal government would act.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission is
the agency that should become involved. Its
congressional mandate is to “protect the public
from unreasonable risks of injury from consumer
products.” In its 1990 annual report, the CPSC
banned 24 separate items from a general group
of 15 product categories that had caused 5,404
deaths. ‘

As the “Cease Fire” study pointed out, the time
has come to invest in feasible new ideas.
Manufacturers need to be motivated through the
responsibility of regulation. Research on how to
make handguns safer, the outright ban of
destructive accessories (armor piercing arnmuni—
tion, and laser sights, for example) and educa-
tion to save the next generation are but a few of
the new ideas that should be tried by the federal
government. Regulating where these weapons
can be purchased is another necessary step.

We owe it to the future to take care of a
problem of our own making. Thirty-five thou-
sand deaths a year is not much of an endorse-
ment for Plan A (what we're doing now). The
“Cease Fire” study presents a Plan B that’s worth
an honest try.

At this time of the year,
hope springs eternal, or
something like that. But I
think it has something to do
with equating springtime
with an internal spawning of
anticipation for the coming
months. Doesn’t seem to
make much sense to me,
but hey, its not the first time
intellectual matters have
ﬂown over my head.

But maybe all this antici— Sometimes victory

members of the Pitt Panther ask the Panthers’ heavy-
wrestling team who will be weight Pat Wiltanger.

Wiltanger, who was seeded
first in the tourney draw for
the big men, tore an anteri-
or cruciate ligament in his
knee and will be forced to
miss the big show in
Carolina. Wiltanger still
placed second in his draw
despite the injury.

preparing for the NCAA qualifiers.

Even though the regular season ended on a sour note
for the team as a whole, these wrestlers have an oppor-
tunity to brighten the wrestling offices up at the
Fitzgerald Field House by having their names placed on
the wrestling program’s Wall of Fame — the wall in the
main office with the names of all the previous All-
American wrestlers from Pitt.

"So before the ref whistles for the start of the first

West: Some say Missou got a
gift when they received the No.
1 seed in the tournament’s
weakest bracket. Those people
will be vindicated when
Cincinnati beats the ‘Cats after
torching Wisconsin (by more
than five, Dunc), a team who
got into the party by the skin of
their teeth.

Head coach Bob Huggins
has watched his Cincy squad

grow up quickly (rookies
Damon Flint and the gap-
toothed Dontonio Wingfield
are playing like sophomores)
and forward Curtis “Zero-
Percent Body Fat” Bostic is a
rock—hard forward. LaZelle
Durden’s perimeter play is
extremely important (ask
Memphis head coach Larry
Finch, who watched the
streaky Durden bomb his

Brame

Tigers with 25 first-half points),
as he can light it up like he did
in last year’s tourney or pro-
vide nuthin’ but mortar from
the arc.

The Cal vs. Wisconsin-Green
Bay game is intriguing, but
Jason Kidd and Lamond
Murray will advance past the
Phoenix and Syracuse (and
right into the NBA). Sorry
Serlin, the ‘Cuse has had a
decent enough season but

aren’t talented enough. Autry
and Moten are an adequate
one-two punch, but Kidd and
Murray (or Temple’s Eddie
Jones and Aaron McKie or
UCLA’s O’Bannons or St. Louis’

~ Erwin Clagget and Donnie

Dobbs) are much, much, much
better. Throw in Monty
Buckley from the perimeter
and surprise freshman Micheal
Stewart on the glass, and this

team could conceivably
beat anyone in this
bracket.

If you want an upset special
in this region, look no further
than Southern Illinois over
Minnesota. Coach Rich Herin’s
squad had lost out on the Big
Dance the past two seasons
after getting beat in the
Missouri Valley champi-
onships, but they’re in this year
against a very inconsistent
Golfer (I mean Gopher, it’s not
my fault that no one can under-
stand him) squad. Talented
enough to blow out Indiana by
50+, Minnesota is also inconsis-
tent enough to lose here in the
first round.

Louisville has little depth, but
no one has five better starters
than Dwayne Morton, Clifford
Rozier, Greg Minor, DeJuan
Wheat and Jason Osborne.

Hit the Highzuay
The Proclaimers
Chrysalis records

It was about thiity years ago
that the British mods obsession
with American soul and R&B
music collided with the Irish
penchant for religious mysti-
cism, typified by Van Morrison’s
hard R&B/rock group Them. It
was only the question of time
before the hard—working, low-
paying reality of life in Ireland
and Scotland discovered an
affinity for African—American
music, parenting a concept
which has been dubbed, by its
musical and literary descen-
dents, “Celtic Soul." This has

 

been documented over the past
three decades in Van Morrison’s
solo work, and most recently in
Roddy Doyle’s book and subse-
quent 1991 film, The
Convzntitnvzems.

Now, on their new album Hit
the Highway, Scotland’s twin
brothers Charlie and Craig Reid,
known collectively  The
Proclaimers, continue in this tra-
dition. Following hot on the
heels of last summer’s hit single

Beimy and,/oon.

Over the past six years, the
Reids have been penning songs
for a new album to get back to
the music they were raised on,
to fully live up to the
Proclaimers’ name. As Craig
said, “We wanted [a name] with
a gospel feel to it that indicated
strength in the vocal delivery, a
sort of spiritual element.”
Adding a full R&B horn section
to the band, and producer and
Everly Brothers band member

-Pete \Y/ingfield, the Proclaimers

have created a record worthy of
that name and that tradition.

It’s a little bit disturbing, at
first, to hear Otis Redding’s clas-
sic “These Arms of Mine” sung
in that trademark thick Scottish
accent, and the brothers
revamping of a 40-year-old
gospel number, “I Want To Be a
Christian” can feel a bit like a
novelty, but after a few listens
to the entire album it is obvious
that this music fits perfectly with
the Proclaimers’ menu. There is
perhaps no one outside of the
American soul world more enti-
tled to sing songs like this.

Songs like “Follow the
Money,” a punching R&B num-
ber declaring the purity and
beauty of working-class life
could easily be the work of a
Sam Cooke or Sam 8; Dave.
Songs like “Shout Shout” and
the driving “Don’t Turn Out
Like Your Mother,” based equal-
ly on the domestic disputes
which caused the recent
breakup of Charlie’s marriage
and the uncertainties and won-
der inherent in the birth of
Craig’s first child, that show the
strain of dark humour in the
Reids’ songwriting.

Much like soul music, politics
is not a direct topic for the
Proclaimers, but the gap
between people’s lives and pol-
itics is all but invisible. The

stanley turrentine
comes home

 

by mike shanley

This weekend the
M a n c h e s t e r
Craftsman's Guild will
host four performances
by iazz legend Stanley
Turrentine.

Since he began play-
ing tenor sax in the
'50s,the Pittsburgh
native has gone on to
receive international
acclaim for his music,
which runs the stylistic
gamut.

Turrentine grew up at
a time when Pittsburgh
was a popular
stopover for musicians
traveling from New
York to Chicago.The
town's club scene
spawned vital forces
such as drummers Art
Blakey and Kenny

Clarke and pianists E

Mary Lou Williams and
Errol Garner.

Stanley and his
brother Tommy, who
played trombone,
made a name for
themselves in local
clubs at that time.

Turrentine eventually
moved on to play with
band leader Tadd
Dameron, who was
also a significant com-
poser in bebop music,
and drummer Max
Roach.

Turrentine's gritty
sax tone made him a
popular sideman as
well as a bandleader.
He began appearing
on a lot of sessions
recorded for Blue Note
Records in the '60s.

The funky sound of
the B3 organ became a
popular staple of iazz
clubs in the early '60s
and when organists
like Jimmy Smith and
Big John Patton led
recording sessions,
Turrentine could often
be heard blowing with
them.

Unlike some more
c o m m e r c i a I
organ/tenor record-
ings of the time,
albums like Smith's
classic Back at the
Chicken Shack rely
less on gimmickry and
more on iazz chops.

On the title cut and
on his own "Minor
Chant," Turrentine dis-
played an authorota-
tive voice with a bop
background, while still
laying down phrases
that wouldn't fly over
the heads of r 'n' b
listeners.

Around the same
time, Turrentine also
played in a more
straightforward vein

 

“with tenor sax master
Ike Ouebec. Although
the session wasn't
released for a few
decades, it presented
an interesting constrast
between Quebec's
smokey romantic sound
and Turrentine's

tougher grit. The ses-
sion also featured

Since then, Turrentine
has not been afraid of
experimenting with his
music to appeal to a
larger audience. His
albums for CTI like
Sugar and Salt Song
show him in more of a
contemporary style and
won him commercial
success.

In the past two years,
the tenor man has
played in several TV
commercials, including
one for 7-UP. But

style. He looks to the primitive
age of rock and roll and finds
inﬂuence in the likes of Hound
Dog Taylor and the wealth of
releases on Sun Records. The
primal energy and intensity of
the blues and rockabilly is evi-
dent in the music.

Spencer’s vocals are reminis-
cent of Screaming Jay Hawkins:
whooping, barking, snarling
and pouting. Although the lyrics
are largly unintelligible, they are
delivered with authority and
display a keen sense of dynam-
ics. His guitar playing is loud
and spastic  John Lee Hooker
on crystal meth. It plods
through the rhythm, and
screams furiously like an
ensemble of power tools in the
solos. Spencer uses a Theremin,
a strange feedback device to
achieve these signature bursts.

Judah Baur’s guitar is equally
intense. His style is aggressive,
nearly savage. He plays hard,
real hard. Herb Hitts from Bad
Vibe magazine, in the liner
notes for Extra Width,
described Judah with “hands all
blurred, professor of his own
six—string style.” He ravages
through the songs, giving their
structure a gnarled, command-
ing edge. He creates a full
sound, solid as granite, which
leaves no room for a bass gui-
tar. The Blues Explosion is bass-
less, and doesn’t regret it.

One of the most undeniable
forces of the Explosion’s sound
is Russel Simin’s drumming. As
idiosyncatic as Spencer and
Bauer are, Sirnin’s drums are

powerful. His playing is so
straightforward, tight and
heavy, it’s frightening. The idea
is simple: be commanding, hot
flashy, and hit the drums hard.
As overwhelming as he sounds,
he does not overshadow the
rest of the band. He anchors
them down and keeps them
from sputtering out of control.

The band smokes. Their crazy
rock and roll sound shakes,
shimmies and thunders. It’s “hot
and cold at the same time,” rag-
ing in every direction. The band
has released several albums,
most notably Extra Width, their
latest.

Spin magazine considered it
one of the top—ten best albums
that you have never heard. A
recent 7-inch adds to John
Spencer Blues Explosion mania,
as does a video for “Afro,” from
Extra Width which appears on
MTV.

They went on a rock and roll
rampage at CMJ’s Music
Marathon, and opened up for
Helmet locally. Now they’re
back.

Wednesday. March 23, at 8

character, an honesty which is
hard to find in music in these
days of spiritless rock and
motionless roll. Scottish tradi-
tion demands of its people a
straightforwardness, though
with a grain of wit, and this is
illustrated in a commanding
way by Hit the Highway.

In “Follow the Money,” the
brothers address their
“Celticness” directly, singing
“You can drop allthat mystical/
Celtic bull.” They prefer to
express their spirituality and
religion in more black-and-
white, anticlerical Christian
terms: “I can’t put my faith in/
Your words and demands/ I
believe in God all right/ it’s folk
like you I just can’t stand.” At
the same time that the
Proclaimers deny mysticism,
however, they emlirace musical
styles whose very essence,
whose “soul,” is rooted in
breaking through reality and
reaching a spiritual healing nec-
essary to continue under diffi-

cult circumstances. In this way,
the Proclaimers have found the
soul at the root of what we call
the “Celt,” and recorded it on
H it the Highway.

Charlie Reid recently said of
the album, “It’s the most
Proclaimers record [so far] 
ten years of performing and
recording in the making. Where
they will go next is unknown,
though we can be certain that if
the next album isn’t better, they
will not release it. As Charlie
said four years ago, “The next
album has to be the best thing
we’ve ever done, or else there’s
no point in putting it out.” Wit
and honesty, urgency and
integrity, spirit and sweat: Celtic
Soul.

Clarks over the past few years
most likely knows what to
expect when they go see the
band live: nothing really fancy
(smoke machines and fireworks
don’t fit Very well in The
Decade or Nick’s Fat City), just
tons of solid, energetic, catchy
rock ‘n roll tunes. I

Love Gone Sour, .Sztspz'cion
and Bad Debt, The Clarks’ first
album since late 1991, is an
almost perfect summary of the
band’s live shows over the past
few years. Though not a live
album, Love does all it can to
show anyone who’s too young
to get into Pittsburgh’s rock ‘n
roll clubs just what they’ve been
missing.

Love is filled with several
songs which have been staples
of The Clarks’ live shows in the
past. Singer Scott Blasey and
company have been belting out
“Treehouse,” “Cigarette,” “Climb
Down” and “Better Day” for
quite some time now.

. Despite the familiarity of most
of the 14 tracks on Love, The
Clarks have been making a
good deal of musical growth
lately. The clang ‘n twang of

Robert James‘ guitar still echoes
back pretty strongly to pre-MTV
R.E.M., but Love undoubtedly
contains The Clarks’ most pro-
gressive work yet.

“Promised Land,” a mysteri-
ous look at commitment and
revenge (“I’ve been tried and
convicted, you’re sending me
away/but I’ll have the last
inscription on judgment day”),
opens with a melancholy,
Doors-y guitar lead which grad-
ually builds up into the song’s
crashing chorus.

Unlike ‘91’s The C/arles, which

contained plenty of straightfor-

ward rock songs (“If I Fall
Through,” “Thought It Was
Free,” “Train of Love”) and one
acoustic ballad (“Penny on the
Floor”), Love contains more of
a musical variety. Pounding
rockers “Behind My Back” and
“Better Day” are offset by some
rather subdued songs such as
“Let You Go” and “Madeline.”
The band even gets down-
right mellow at times. The dark,
haunting “Madeline” is another
song based on what appears to
be Blasey’s favorite subject:
screwed-up romances. The

closing lyrics, “Tell her that you
mind the way she crosses her
heart and says I hope to die/I
guess I’ll never know you/I
guess I’ll never know why,”
could make one wonder if
Blasey has been listening to
Sting lately. And, for those fans
of the “unplugged" craze, The
Clarks even throw in an
acoustic version of “I’m The
Only,” which first appeared on
their 1988 debut, I’ll Tell You
What, Man.

Loves finest moments, how-
ever, are those which make one
feel like they’re actually sitting
at one of those miniscule round
tables on a dark, smoky night at
Graffiti. The only things missing
from “Tell Me” "and “Cigarette”
are Blasey’s ad~libs and beer-
chugging crowds singing along
with the chorus.

Accurately capturing the ener-
gy of 21 bands live show on disc
is usually a major accomplish-
ment. To do this on an album
recorded in the studio is noth-
ing short of incredible.

Gimme a smoke, man!

Lacrosse team putting "D" back into a mean ole defense

Win over Grove City College has lacrosse team rolling along with a perfect, 4-0 record

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team
added Grove City College to its
list of victims Tuesday night at
the Cost Center by defeating
them 21-3. The win raises the
team’s record to a perfect 4-0 to
open the season.

Pitt has outscored their
opponents so far by a combined
score of 68-18, and
Tuesday night’s game was no
different.

“We’re just that far ahead of

_ eveybody else right now, and

the guys are playing very well,”
head coach Gary Neft said.
“This game here was with our
subs, that’s just how deep we
are this year. We’re just
loaded.”

However, they are not as
loaded as they used to be,
thanks to a pair of injuries to
key players Eric Kaveny and
Darrell Schmitt.

Kaveny will be out indefi-
nitely after injuring his wrist in
the season opener against
Frostburg State, and Schmitt will
be out for about two weeks
with a bad knee. His
injury occurred in the last game
on March 3, against
the Pittsburgh Lacrosse
Club.

“Monday when I tried to
practice with my coach, it
swelled up, and I had trouble
walking and I had no ﬂexibility
in it,” Schmitt said.

“I went to the doctor, and I

have to wait until April 4 until I»

hear from him. I’m supposed to
be out until then, but I think I’m
going to play on Thursday
[against West Virginia
Wesleyanl.”

Yet without missing a beat
the Panthers dominated the
game from the start and led 14—2
at halftime.

The scoring punch came
from Brett Mulligan who led the

way with four goals and two
assists.

Brian Barrett also added
three goals and an assist, while
Ed Croot and Eric Seamen each
contributed a goal and an assist.

The defensive tandem also
looked good, and Goalie Brian
Schiff had some nice saves to
his credit.

“Grove City is a weak team,
so it’s hard to measure. I
thought that overall we played
solid defense,” defenseman
John Foris said.

“We only let up three goals,
and in any lacrosse game that is
excellent.

"Our defense is solid this
year, Matt Shea, Luke Fox, Tim
Kenkel, Darrell Schmitt and Stu
Flank make up a good combi-
nation with myself up top
as a long—stick middie,” he
said.

The team’s last game against
PLC was definitely their most
competitive as they were forced

to face their first comeback of
the year. PLC opened the game
with a 4-0 run, but the Panthers
showed their determination and
got hot at the end
of the first half as they went on
to win the game by the score of
15-8.

“We’ve been playing each
other for so many years and we
all play in summer league
together that everybody knows
how each other will play,” Tim
Kenkel said.

“PLC games are always close
—— they’re always rough. They
are a big bunch of guys
who know how to play
lacrosse.”

After taking care of business
against the Wolverines of Grove
City, the team faces West
Virginia Wesleyan on Thursday
night at the Cost Center at 8

p.m., and then they will_ play"

their first game of the year
outdoors on Saturday afternoon
at 2 p.m. against

Division III rival Fredonia (NY)
State.

Thursday’s game should be
competitive, but it still should
be no problem for the team
compared to their past perfor-
mances.

“West Virginia Wesleyan
should be an exciting game.
They have an established pro-

gram, and I’m looking for a fun,

and exciting game,” Kenkel
said.

Saturday’s game should be
the toughest one so far for Pitt,
and if they win they stand a
good chance of going into the
Pittsburgh Lacrosse Shootout
undefeated.

“I think that Saturday’s game

may be the best one,” Neft said.
“They beat us three years ago
up there, but I just think that
we’re on a roll and the guys are
playing really well.”

“There shall be some
revenge in the air,” Kenkel
said.

onship game, this team is talent-
ed, deep, wild and crazy.

Illinois will route Georgetown
in the eight—nine game (the only
thing more boring than watch-
ing Jay Leno rollerblade with
Bonnie Blair). The Hoyas
helped themselves by getting to
the Big East finals, but they will
get destroyed by Dean Tohmas
and super-frosh Kiwane Garris
(]B’s advice of the week to T].
Wheeler: it, um, isn’t the best
thing to drink and drive  a
week before the
tourney.)

I think I am going toroot for

Jim Harrick’s UCLA Bruins

because that former All-America
at UCLA, your fav and mine, Bill
Walton isn’t. The much-
maligned Bruins are full of
friendly, boy—next—door phe-
noms such as the O’Bannons
(Ed, Charllie, Joe Bob, Steve
and Ed again) and Shon Tarver.
Will they have enough to
progress past the second game?
Yes. Further? No.

Winners: Michigan beats
Texas, UMass over St. Louis,
Arkansas over the Illini and
UCLA over Big Country and OK
St.

East: Penn vs. Nebraska ——
what could be one of the best
first-round games in the coun-
try. Penn has got three PTPers
in Matt Maloney, Jerome Allen
and Barry Pierce, gunners and
slashers. Nebraska counters
with Eric Piatkowski.

With an upset of conference
champs Missou in the tourney,
the ‘Huskers are playing some
of the best hoops in the coun-
try, but Penn busts out any Ivy
League myths by playing up-
tempo ball. No matter who
you’re rooting for, make sure
you see this game. I’ll take Penn
by a bucket.

Florida’s backcourt of Steel
High’s pride and joy Craig
Brown and Dan Cross make up
a pair that are playing excep-
tionally well together right now.
Unlike Pugs, I think I’m a—gonna

the Quakers.

No. 2 UConn has got an easy
bracket and will blow away
Rider and then UAB to get to
the Sweet 16. Donyell Marshall
is unbelievable — a 6-11 scorer
who can do it all. He can step
out on any center in the coun-
try, he can block shots, he can
dunk and he can pose. Throw
in guard Kevin Ollie, who has
come on of late, Doron Sheffer
and role players Donny
Marshall and Brian Fair and this
is a No. 2 seed that will cake-
walk through their half of the
bracket.

Bob Knight is Bob Knight ——

he always finds ways to win.

Forget the Ohio U. game,
Knight's Hoosiers will give
Temple a lot of trouble. The
one way to beat the Owls’
match-up zone is to shoot over
it, and IU can do just that.
Damon Bailey has played well,
moving to seventh on IU’s all-
time scoring list. Alan
Henderson has, since the first
few ‘weeks of the season,
stopped favoring his bad leg.
Shooters Bryan Evans and Pat
Graham provide perimeter help
for a team that is not that talent-
ed or deep, but still solid
enough to do some damage.

Temple has the same problem
that Louisville does — good tal-
ent, no depth. McKie and Jones
log a ton of minutes, and point
man Rick Brunson sometimes
logs all 40 for head man John
Cheney. Derrick Battle has

and Jason Ivey has also played
well.

'The key here, however, is
McKie and Jones. The duo has
gotten them this far and will get
them further. Both are incredi-
ble athletes and incredible ball
players.

Pugspeak: Temple got
absolutely screwed — there’s no
reason that they should be a
four seed. The tournament com-
mittee doesn’t know their geog-
raphy because [Temple and
Drexell are a pair of Big Five
City League rivals. It’s going to
a death battle, and it isn’t fair
to either team.

How can a team with as much
talent as North Carolina lose six
games? Possibly too much tal-
ent?

No, the public’s opinion of
Dean Smith is far overrated. He
can recruit, but with a team this
talented how could he possibly
not win? It is time for him to
abandon his arcane traditions of
letting seniors play no matter
what and let the kids get some

run. Jerry Stackhouse and
Rasheed Wallace are for real.
Eric Montross has had a very
subpar season, finishing around
fourth among centers in many
key categories, like scoring,
rebounding, etc. Smith must
take this team to Charlotte and
Monday night. Otherwise, they
will go down as one of the most
overblown disappointments in
college basketball.

Pugspeak: Yhe biggest ques-
tion of the tourney is if Dean
mith has ﬁgured out that his
two best players are ferry
Stackhouse and Rasheed
Wallace. Kevin Salvadori and
Brian Reece are stiffs, and Eric
Montross is very average. Reece
looks lost and is afraid he’s
going to be pulled every stop-
page of play. That is no way to
handle your players.

The baby bluers don’t have
their annual cakewalk and
could get a huge surprise in the
second round by the Pac 10’s
high-flying Cougars of
Washington St.

Pugspeak: Washington St. is

another underrated team with
an underrated coach in Kelvin
Sampson. Mark Hendrickson is
one of the best leapers in
America.

Winners: Florida beats Penn
in a shoot-out, UConn waltzes
over UAB, Carolina knocks off
Washington St. and Temple
beats Indiana by 12.

Southeast: Everyone knows
about Glenn Robinson, so I
won’t waste any characters.
Providence, who has peaked
late, will beat ‘Bama but lose to
the Boilermakers. Some ‘say
Micheal Smith and Dickey
Simpkins will knock Robinson
down a lot and intimidate him.
Yeah, right.

Wake Forest, who finished
third in the ACC, is great, and in
fine position at number five.
Trelonnie Owens and Randolph
Childress rival the best in a two-
man team, and Tim‘ Duncan
plays great defense in the
paint. V _

Pugspeak: Everybody knows
Childress is one of the top scor-

ers in America. They have been
overshadowed by Carolina and
Duke in the ACC.

Kansas will beat upstart UT-
Chattanooga, but the Wake train
will roll through Roy Williams’
best. Dave Odom has done a
great job, and the Deacs will be
playing next weekend.

Bottom line, Seton Hall

I should not be in the tourna-

ment. They supposedly played
themselves in with a strong
showing in the Big Easts, but
Georgia Tech is currently out-
side looking in a Dance they
should be part of.

Michigan St. has Shawn
Respert. Seton Hall has a flight
home.

Kentucky has become famous
for bombing and smiling, but
some people have forgotten
that you need an inside game,
too. Jared Prickett is not enough
in the paint -— Rodney Dent’s
leg injury disqualifies them for
heavy consideration to advance
farther than the second round,

A Land1ord’s Thanks to
EIHSTING TENANTS
and a Landlord’s message to
FUTURE TENANT S
We at Glickman Real Estate thank
our present tenants especially the
high percentage that renewed. You
that are prospective tenants will be
pleased to discover the best
service, the best furniture, and the
best values, but we also have the
SHARPEST TENANT S
because we screen our tenants
carefully (and obtain parents’
signatures). Consequently, you can
be assured that other tenants in the
building are generally mature and
sharp.

We run a
TIGHT SHIP
which translates further to fewer
problems with your rommates and
other tenants in the building.
WE INVITE YOU TO
validate our claims by checking
with our existing tenants in our
absence and having your parents
call the Student Housing Office.
Although we may be demanding,
we “give good” in return because
we appreciate “together" tenants.

Classic card: a body of services and peace of
mind for students, now with No Annual Fee. For years, scientists could only

theorize about the Citibank Classic Visa® card, unable to actually observe anything below its epidermal surface
(i.e. the plastic). Surely the highly intelligent services were evidence of an advanced brain. But with the latest
advances in x-ray technology, and when the light could catch the various parts just so, it was conﬁrmed: the

Citibank Classic Visa card is head to toe more evolved than

ever imagined. ‘H At its backbone are 3 services to cover the
purchases you make on the card. Starting at the Lower Costa]
Spine, we see Citibank Price Protection can assure you of

the best price. All you have to do is discover the same item

 

advertised in print for less, within 60 days, and Citibank will

 

‘Scientists theorize that the mind of the Citibank Classic Visa refund the difference up to $1501. Along the 00pS_Il._S[l-pped

cardmember (Fig. A) is secure because it receives superior
service; the mind of the non—Citibank Classic Visa cardmember _ _ Sm » _
(Fig. B) is not secure because—c0uld it he?—it hasascrew loose? DISC, Buyers Security can cover thOS€ purchases against

accidental damage, ﬁre or theft, for 90 days from the date of purchase‘; and Citibank Lifetime Warranty“ allows
one to extend the warranty for the expected service life of eligible products up to 12 yearsz. So if you ever buy a
walkman, a stereo, whatever, it will be reassuring to know that Citibank can bend and be ﬂexible while still lending
support. 1] The backbone is then connected to the cranium or headbone. Look at the bottom of the page. The
Citibank Photocard has the head of the cardholder, as well as his or her own signature, right on the front. That
way, it will help prevent fraud. It will also make a good form of ID, since you get to choose your own photo. '1] But
what about the Nervous System? The fact is, it doesn’t have one, not in the spinal cord nor in the brain. What it has
is the Very Calm System. Because even if your credit card gets stolen, or gets lost, an involuntary muscle called
the Extendus Anewcardeus activates the Lost Wallet“ Service which can replace your card usually within
24 hours. 11 As suspected, there’s another involuntary muscle: the heart—a beating and caring heart, big enough
to give students special discounts and savings. You’ll receive a $20 Airfare Discount on domestic ﬂights3;
savings on mail order purchases, sports equipment, magazines and music; a low variable interest rate of 15.4%“;
and, No Annual Fee. (In other words, the card itself doesn’t cost a forelimb and a hindlimb.) ‘H Naturally the
heart of the Citibank Visa card pumps life and personalized customer service into all its parts, 24 hours a
day. So no matter what the question you might have concerning your card, you need only call the
800 number, You’ll ﬁnd Citibank has a neck they are eager to stick out for you. They will always lend
an ear. Or a hand. They will keep an eye out for you. They will put their best foot forward. Etc. ‘[1 So call
