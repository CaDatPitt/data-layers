news of the mass murder of the

most shocking fact about the
whole affair is that the murderer
is none other than the Cady’s

lavished by the entire family——

dollars which were virtually
poured down the drain in getting
people to listen to his music.

Tremendous Struggle

County Coroner Dr. Asbestos
Linsey-Woolsey stated that a tre-
mendous struggle had obviously
taken place between the victims
and the iron-fisted, Herculean
murderer. "He apparently used
some sort of large, pointed in-
like a
knife,” the coroner reported.

The scene of the quadruple
slaying was the studio of the
would-be musician. It was dif-

strum ent, something

ficult for the police to ascertain
the motive for the murder. It is
believed that the killer had an
overpowering addiction to tutti-
frutti ice cream and that when
the Cady family refused to sub-
mit to his whims any longer,

Crazed Musician;

City in Mourning

By ANNE O’SMARE MCCORBACK
The ’36 Big Flood and the ’SO Big Snow will long be remem-
bered by the townspeople of this city, but the year 1951 will go
down in Pittsburgh’s history as the year of the Big Murder and will
probably remain in the memories of Pittsburghers long after the

The city was plunged into gloom and despair this week when the

N0 CRIME WAVE, SAYS LAWRENCE

Cady, Kensinger, Brusco

Cases "Just Coineidences”

Emphatic denial that the City
is in the grip of a crime wave
was voiced last night by Mayor
David L. Lawrence. The mayor
hurried to Police Headquarters
when news was flashed over the
local television station, WDTV,
that four people had been killed,
and the mayor was seen there by
reporters.

“You may say to your read-
ers,” said Mr. Lawrence, “that
the city is positively not in the

grip of a crime wave. I am aware
that the killing of these four
people, coming as it does after
the Brusco murder and the Ken-
singer killing and eight or ten
others, might Cause some people
to think that there was a crime
epidemic of some sort going on.”
Bus Terminals Watched

"I do not believe, however,”
he pointed out, "that the murder-
ers worked together in any way.
Each of them made up his mind

quite separately to commit the
murders in question, andthey will
all be apprehended within 24
hours. Every bus in the city is
being watched, and so are the
railroad terminals. Moreover, the
men assigned to this duty report
some very interesting sights
indeed.”

Myers Blames Administration

Ex-Senator Francis J. Myers
while trying to get a friend on
the telephone happened to get
connected with the Pitt News by
mistake, and consented to give
his views on the murder.

“I do not know Neil McRae,”
said the senator, "but I am not

surprised that a thing of this sort
shai ld take place under the pres-
ent administration. The quota of
Roumanians for the month was
exhausted on the 32nd, and the
bonus is unfair in every way to
organized labor. Then where
would the UN be?”

LIVINGSTON, Pa.-— Livingston
residents who heard tonight of
the killing of all the Cadys by
native son Neil McRae did not
express themselves as surprised
at the news, as young McRae
was known here as a peculiar
chap. Old citizens recalled that

McRae took to the knife. This
is, however, just a supposition.
McRae Nuts

The city psychiatrist stated
that the man was obviously a
psychotic with schizoid tenden-
cies given to cycloid swings not
alleviated by an oﬁ‘-center libido.
In the words of Dr. Quacko, "I
wouldn’t put anything past him. ”
As a matter of fact, McRae was
found trying to palm off some of
Tschaikovsky’s music as his
own.

Meanwhile, the murderer,
America’s new Public Enemy No.
1, has been placed in solitary
confinement in the County jail.
The bodies of his victims have
been removed to the mortuary of
Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer, and
Ledbetter at 4214 Bigelow Blvd.
Mayor Proclaims Mourning

Thoughtful friends of the be-
loved Cadys have hired the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
to play "Rock of Ages” in the
slumber chamber where the fam-
ily will lie in state. The hymn
was Mrs. Cady’s favorite.

With the tragic passing of the
Cadys, an era has come to a
close. In commemoration of this
event, Mayor David L. Lawrence
has proclaimed one minute of
silence to take place at exactly
31471/2 a.m. Friday morning.

as a small boy he rarely played
with other boys, but was always
off by him self. Hundreds of Liv-
ingstonians trooped out tonight
to stand morbidly around the old
McRae home, where the murderer

'was born and grew up.

General regret was expressed
at the death of the Cadys, ex-
cept in the case of Homer. F. G.
Cady was well known here. He
built the Chatham and Phoenix
Buildings, and it was in a small
shop on Downe Street that he
made his first widget, doing the
work entirely by hand with the
aid of only one mechanic.

The Cady Murder

What has happened to the sanctity of the American home? The
Cady murder has revealed to the great AMERICAN PEOPLE that
there are more PARLOR PINKS than it knows. Not to mention
Chrysanthemums. Look out for the SEVENTH COLUMN and lay off
the gin.

If such OUTRAGEOUS CRIMES are to be committed against
humanity, the BURLESQUE HOUSES should be Closed down!
Goodbye, Bubblesll

The reactionary Truman government should GET WISE some day
and send all the REDS to Lower Slobbovia. Let’s not get NAMBY-
PAMBY at this stage of the game.

After all, WIDGETS represent a MAJOR PART of our national
ECONOMY. More WIDGETS, better WAGES. Let’s go, PITT!!!

In conclusion, with malice toward some, give me LIBERTY and
give me death.

Letters to the Editor
THE WHITE HOUSE

January 9. 1951
To the Mayor and Citizens of the City of Pittsburgh:

It was a great shock to me to hear that my friends, the Cadys,
met with such an untimely end. Their memory will always remain
dear to me.

I am herewith volunteering for the funeral a few regiments of the
Navy’s Police Force, er, the Marines, I mean, to march in the pro-
cession. My daughter Margaret will be happy to sing Mrs. Cady’s
favorite hymn at the services. (That’s an order and let’s hear no
more about it!)

Back again in ’52!

Cordially,
Harry S Truman

FREDERICK CADY

Prominent manufacturer of widgets, Mr. Cady was a great bene-
factor of humanity. He was accustomed to saying that had there
been no Andrew Carnegie, he personally would have seen to it that
all the good works established by his predecessor would have been
established by himself. "Yep, yep—I can see it now,” Mr. Cady
would say, "Cady Institute of Technology, Cady Museum, and all
those dandy libraries. Yep, yep, I’d ’a built ’em all. Yep, yep!”

Mr. Cady represented the modern Horatio Alger hero. Born of
humble parents on a tugboat in the Allegheny River, he assumed
full support of a family of 17 at the age of 4, working as a news-
boy. By dint of hard work and perseverance, Fred Cady took over
the newspaper, the paper mills, and the forests in Montana from
which the paper was made. He was twelve years old at that time.

Although he could well afford the tuition, he preferred to work
his way through college as a singing waiter at the La Cucaracha
Cafe. It was while singing there one evening that he met his future
wife, socialite Hepzibah Mfft.

After graduation from the University of Pittsburgh with a major
in widgit engineering, Mr. Cady married Miss Mfft and the couple
had two children.

Along with his many business associations, Mr. Cady belonged
to many social organizations. He was a member of the Bird-
and Bourbon-and-Water Society, the Widgiteers of America, the Golf
and Gin Country Club, and the Association for the Beautification
of the Fire Hydrants of Pittsburgh, of which he was president for
28 years.

HEPZIBAH MFFT CADY

Pittsburghers will long remember Mrs. Frederick Cady as one of
the foremost churchwomen of this area. She personally organized
126 hymn-"singing societies, serving as president‘ of all 126.

According to her last will and testament, the entire text of
"Rock of Ages” will be inscribed upon her tombstone and a built-
in perpetual Wurlitzer will pump out the music for eternity.

Born of a family accustomed to great wealth and social promin-
ence, Mrs. Cady never did a lick of work in her life, but she did
nothing extremely well. She was a ‘C-plus’ student at Miss Bull-
finch’s School for the Non-Educating of Young Gentlewomen of
Genteel Birth before she met a nd married Frederick Cady.

HOMER CADY

Considered a young man of great promise in his Harvard days,
Homer Cady was elected as the young man “most likely to suc-
ceed in getting rid of a cold one of these days.” His classmates
expected him to go far in his chosen profession—whenever he got
around to choosing it.

The younger Mr. Cady was considered one of the most eligible
bachelors in town and his untimely demise came as a shock to the
fair damsels of Pittsburgh. Twenty-seven socially prominent deb-
tantes were said to have fallen in dead faints when news «of his
murder leaked out. ‘

Like his father, Homer Cady was an active clubmember. He
belonged to the Long Tales and Short Beers Club, the exclusive
Straight-Bourbon and Bowling Society, the Pitt Independents, and
the Flea-Weight Athletic Boxing Club.

GLADYS CADY MCRAE

Miss Cady’s ‘Coming-Out Ball,’ held at the fashionable Univer-
sity Grill, was the main social event a few seasons ago. She was
considered the belle of the ‘Greeks’ before her unfortunate entan-
glement with Neil McRae, who eventually murdered her.

Like her mother, the former Miss Cady was never guilty of doing
anything at any time in her life. In this, she probably surpassed
her mother. It was said that she was gifted with extraordinary mus-
ical talents which McRae tried to squelch.

The former Miss Cady (and late Mrs. McRae) had many friends
during her short lifetime. She was the idol of lower Craig Street.
An alumna of East Overshoe University, she participated actively
in the Mouton and Mothballs Society, the Rudolph Valentino Fan
Club, and the Freud, Nietsche, and Al Capp Thursday Discussion
Circle.
