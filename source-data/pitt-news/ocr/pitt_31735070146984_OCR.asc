Defy predictions — take democracy

0 you like the feeling you
D get when people place
bets against you?

Well, judging from how young
voters conﬁrm the predictions
of political scientists every four
years — when they skip midterm
elections en masse —— perhaps
being deemed to fail is somehow
exhilarating. -

Just look at the 2006 mid-

. terms — according to a report

on civicyouth.org, although more
than 50 percent of older voters
visited the polls, only a quarter
of eligible "voters aged 18 to 29
found democratic participation
more important than watching,
and then re-watching, the third

- season of “Lost” on Hulu.

ions

But The Pitt News’ nerves are
strong enough not to let broad,
national statistics get us down.
We believe that — given the
quality of our student body --
at least Pitt students will be the
ones to break the apathetic mold
on Nov. 2.

And they should know that if 6

they don’t, it’s really their own
futures at stake.

The truth is, college students
have ample reason to be con-
cerned about the future, and
voting is a constructive way to
address that concern. One huge

v reason is college students’ in-

creasingly embattled pocket-
books. ’
According to the Christian

Science Monitor, last year about
8 million college students — out
of fewer than 20 million total
students —— beneﬁted from a

.bailout-era college tax credit

that’s set to expire after this se-

_ mester —- unless, of course, Con-

gress does something about it.
The credit, called the American
Opportunity Credit, was passed
as part of the 2009 American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act
and has made it easier for low-
to middle-income families to
ﬁnance their children’s "higher
education. ‘

Instead of the federal gov— _
ernment offering a maximum-of

$1,200 in tax breaks per year,
per student for only two years of

college ‘— which was the case be-
fore the new credit — this year,
families could beneﬁt yearly from
up to $2,500 in tax breaks that
would continue for all four years
of college. But, the credit could
disintegrate into historical dust
in a matter of months.

In pursuing a more affordable,
more accessible higher—education
system and an advancing nation
as a whole, having such initia-
tives vanish could be a tragedy
for millions of students, espe-
cially considering a depressing
job market and skyrocketing tu-
ition hikes. As President Obama
has said, “We’ve got to make sure
that in good times or bad, our
families can invest in their chil-

dren’s future and in the future of
our country.”_

Although the tax—credit issue
is only one example of how the
government directly and signifi-
cantly affects our collegiate lives,
it underscores how getting to the
polls should be particularly im-
portant for students. So over the
next week and a half, take charge
of your future — research candi-
dates’ positions, attend debates
and town hall meetings and get an
absentee ballot already if you’ve
been planning on it. As most of
the country’s 18- to 29-year-olds
will likely shirk their civic duties,
we’re sure you’ll send the politi-
cal scientists the message that
Pitt takes voting seriously. I

' THE STAMATTACK

Respect the Colonel, be an entrepreneur

By studying the founder of KF C Corp., students can realize the beauty of creating wealth out of nothing

_ Nick Stamatakis
Columnist ’

He’s the white-suited, bearded old
man on the chicken bucket who ac-
companies you on your pilgrimage
towards Kentucky Fried bliss. A
colonel — well, an honorary colo-
nel — whose recipe of 11 herbs
and spices changed the world.
And he was a real man, which
apparently isn’t obvious to many A

college students. According to a -

recent USA Today poll, only half of
18- to 24-year—olds could identify
Colonel Sanders, the founder of
KFC, as a real person. The other
half considered him to be only a
ﬁctional spokesperson — a South-
ern-gentleman version of Ronald
McDonald.

To the half of you who are still
in shock that he was real, you can
be comforted by knowing that
your ignorance isn’t completely
your fault: KFC has not marketed
the Colonel well and has strayed
from its fried—chicken roots in
recent years. Plus, without a KFC
on campus, there isn’t too much

. reason to be thinking about it that

often.

But if this poll only spoke
about the fast-food industry, this
wouldn’t be much of a column.

Incidentally, a bigger truth about

the nation as a whole was revealed
by the survey: increasing disre-
gard toward the value of starting
a business.

Starting a business never used
to be such an odd thing in this
country, and really it still isn’t.
Even with the recession, about 104
in 100,000 adults started a new
business in 2009, the highest rate
in 14 years.

But we don’t celebrate business
leaders like we used to. As the poll
shows, Colonel Sanders is quickly
becoming forgotten, which I imag-
ine is true of many of the founders
of other popular businesses. You
can probably name more brands
of beer than business founders.

, A This is;-bad though, because a
new businesses are the primary

source of wealth and jobs in
America. _j_*A Kauffman Founda-
tion studyiffound that from 1977
to 2005, e:stablis'hed businesses
actually were _a net job killer for
a majori-gt-T..of the time, while
start-ups were the source of all
net gains.i§I7n other words, while

older businesses become more ef-
ﬁcient and require fewer workers,
new businesses create wealth out
of nothing and need more work-
ers. Even considering the fact that

. most start-ups fail, this truth still

stands.
So as much as the Colonel is
derided —— for contributing to

. Americans’ unhealthy‘ eating

habits, for being a symbol of a
romanticized South, for making
it impossible to have a sweet white

brightest join Teach For America,
which, according to The'New York
Times, saw a 32 percent jump in

‘applicants for a total of nearly

50,000 in 2010. And in 2009, over
27.3 percent of college graduates
were planning on going into gov-

. ernment or nonproﬁt work, up 5 A
_ percent from the year before.

But are these people creating
jobs or actually creating wealth?
N 0, at least not directly. Although
lauded for being so selﬂess, they

sons — what he did above all else
was magicallycreate wealt:h out

hesitate to guess that few

   

consider business creationfjtop be.

a virtuousthing. 

 Instead, increasing numlfe -s’ of
college graduates who wa “to;-be
.Vi_rtuous are devoting theiizigtime
to service. Many of the coLﬁ1try’s

 

could be thought of as a wasted
resource, as many possess the
talents and skills that could be
used to create actual wealth in
new businesses. I

In TFA’s case in particular,
there isn’t scholarly consensus on

. whether the program is effective.
For example, a,2002 study out of ‘

Arizona Stat‘e]-’University‘ found
that TFA-instructed students per-

formed just as well as students

taught by under—certiﬁed teach-

ers. Sure they might be helping
children learn how to read, but is
that a good trade-off considering
the wealth and service a new busi-
ness could have provided in terms
of new employment opportunities
and consumer satisfaction? I’m
inclined to believe not. g.-1.

More people need to see creat-
ing a business in this light. Good-
hearted, smart people —— which I
do believe represent a large por-
tion of college graduates —- need
to realize that you can actually
create personal wealth and soci-
etal wealth. It is not a zero-sum

' game.

So the next time you decide
you really need a bacon sandwich
with melted cheese and two greasy
pieces of chicken as buns,remem—
ber to thank Colonel Sanders. His
vision has made you happier, a
chicken supplierhappier, a cheese

supplier happier and a truck driver a
_ happier. Then, if we collectively ‘
remember the people whostarted

businesses, perhaps more olonel

Sandjerses will exist.

Cindy Albert, costume shop
foreman, said as she wandered
through the costume storage
room, pointing out various aisles,
like ones for suit jackets, petti-
coats and even a “weird stuff”
aisle that includes items like
chaps and serapes.

The Theatre Arts Depart-
ment’s large costume collection is
a necessity for the organization,
which uses numerous costumes
in each show. St.‘Pierre breaks
it down by explaining that if the
department has a show of 20
people and each person needs
three costumes, that adds up
to 60 costumes, not including
the several options they like to
have for the costume designer to
choose from.

MOVIE COLUMN

 

Horror-movie lovers should look outside the U.S..

Tybout suggests that those with a taste for scary ﬂicks should consider the wealth of movies made in other countries. ‘

Andy Tybout

Horror fans, rest easy: Even if
this season’s crop of scary movies
seems limp and uninspired,_.the
rest of the world is there to pick
up the slack.

Rather than settling for the

- latest diminishment of the “Saw”

franchise, I’d direct audiences

to look overseas for more truly

unsettling, less 3-D-dependent
takes on the horror genre. This
might be a daunting prospect

Family, after all, offers little that
we haven’t seen already.
Thankfully, world cinema is
becoming increasingly acces-
sible, and other countries have
lately been turning out their own
“Exorcist”- and “Paranormal
Activity”-type motion pictures.
Below is a compilation of the

V . , ‘ . . . . . . i . 1

foreign ﬁlms made in the last ﬁve

years that have managed to tran- V

scend cultural barriers to terrify
audiences across the globe. .

- “The Orphanage” (2007): Not
to be confused with “Orphan”
—V which I’m told is equally dis-
turbing — “The Orphanage” is a

‘Spanish—1anguage, Guillermo del

Toro—produced ﬁlm with a decep-
tively familiar beginning: family
and child move into an orphan-
age, child develops mysterious
new “friend,” child disappears.
Soon, however, the story
fractures into a frenzied and
complicated narrative. Hidden
antechambers are unearthed.
Old women are hit by cars. Most

memorably, there’s a catch at the

end that manages to blow your
mind without undermining the
preceding scares. Like much of
del Toro’s' directorial work, “The
Orphanage” is a cocktail of ter-
ror, imagination and poignancy
that leaves an indelible impres-
sion.

“The Host” (2006):.Ifyou’ve
read my column in the past, you’ll
notice thatl pay frequent lip
service to Joon-ho Bong’s “The
Host,” a South“ Korean monster
ﬁlm that brilliantly exceeds the
sum of its parts.

The setup is straightforward:
chemicals are being dumped into
the Han River, awakening a mam-
moth fish-like beast that soon
spirits away a family’s teenage
daughter. The execution, how-
ever, is complex and masterful -
the family of “The Host” is unfor-

- gettable, as are their increasingly

elaborate rescue plots. g

In equal parts horror film,
tragedy and black comedy, “The
Host” broke box- office records in
South Korea not only bec_,aus.e it
featured a deftlyimagined mon-
ster, but also because it drew on

. disparate genres in a way few B—,

movies had before.

“The Troll Hunter” (@010):
First, a disclaimer: Seei1jgg%as it
has no official U.S. releasjedate,

I haven’t seen this ﬁlm — I can
only endorse it based on the stel-
lar reception it’s garnered at the
Fantastic Fest ﬁlm festival in
Austin, Texas. With its rapidly
mounting hype, however, it’s only
a matter of time before ithits
more States.

Not to be confused with the
upcoming Guillermo del Toro
project “Trollhunters,” this

' Norwegian “Cloverfield”—esque

mockumentary follows a group

of intrepid students into the I

black woods of Scandinavia,
where they discover '— surpris-
ingly enough — giant, homicid-
al trolls who have the ability to

A “smell the blood” of Christians.

The subtitled trailer is wonder-

, fully hyperbolic, promising “a

ﬁlm so revealing that it changes
your concept of society!_” More
likely, it’ll be a mockumentary so
entertaining that it bolsters your
opinion of Norwegian cinema. -

“Let the Right One In” (-2008):”
The first thing audiences will.

notice about Swedish vampire
ﬂick “Let the Right One In” is
its impeccable cinematography
—- never has Scandinavia looked
more bleak and austere. “The sec-
ond thing audiences will notice is
its protagonist, a 12-year-old boy
named Oskar who wanders about
the courtyard of his apartment
complex, absorbed in loneliness.
That is, until he meets the girl
next door, a friendly but mysteri-
ous kid who, unbeknownst to Os-
kar, massacres people and drinks
their blood. The bond these two
“children” form —— a morbid play
on preteen romance ,— retains
a poignancy that “Twilight” can
only hope to emulate.

ﬁlm’s American adaptation, “Let

Rarely do you see a CIA—endorsed assassi-

Youthful, agile agents who don’t look

agents in pop culture. But “Red” seeks to
change that by proposing a new View of a
different sideof being a spy: retirernent.

a boring life in a nameless suburb. His
only excitement comes from ripping up
his government pension checks just so he
can talk to Sarah (Mary—Louise Parker),
the customer service woman on the other
end of the telephone, who reads romance
novels and wants to travel.

That is, until a hit squad tries to as-

_sassinate him in the middle of the night.

But our retiree, not to be underestimated,
manages to defeat them all.

His obvious next move is to ﬁnd out
who is trying to kill him and why. Instead,
he gets swept up in a rescue/kidnapping
after he realizes the CIA will go after Sarah
(they can track phones calls, it turns out)
and asks, ahem. . .forces, her to come with

Not only will the sale serve as a ﬁ1nd-

perfect for Halloween. With the kind of

Nothing at the sale costs more than $10.
and there are set pricelists broken down

will go to Goodwill, but inevitably, some
gems. that were previously hidden in the

The Pitt volleyball team set a Panther record for the most kills in one
game (110), against Robert Morris on Tuesday night.

Torie Wytiaz
' Stajf Writer

Strong defense has been a hall-'

mark of the 2010 Pitt volleyball

' team, but during Tuesday’s 3-2

victory over Robert Morris, one
woman took those efforts to a
record-setting level.

Sophomore libero Margy Ac-
ton set a Pitt record with 45 digs
in the five-set match, breaking
the previous record of 36 digs
set by Megan McGrane during
the 2003 season.

“Margy had a great match and
the record she set is very impres-
sive,” head coach Toby Rens said.
“I am very pleased with her level
of play.” . '

Acton joined the team" this

-season after transferring from

Lehigh, and she found little dif-
ficulty in the transition.

“I do my best to be a leader for
the defense,” Acton said. “I think

. I get more comfortable in that

ts dig record in 3-2win

role every time we play.”

As such a leader, Acton also
played a part in another record
set in the match. The Panthers
earned 110 kills as a team, sur-
passing their previous record of
98. .

“Our defense is a way to keep
us in the match,” Rens said.
“Good'defense allows our offense
to work efficiently.” ' ,

Defensive stability, combined
with the offensive power of senior
outside hitter Amy Town, allowed
the Panthers to prevail in a close
match against nonconference lo-
cal opponent"Robert Morris.

Town recorded a match—high
25 kills and added 16 digs in her
fourth consecutive double—dou-
ble performance.

The Panthers (10-13) won with

, set scores of 23-25, 25-13, 24-26,

25-16 and 15-13. -

‘ Rens said Pitt’s success in
their winning sets came from
an aggressive serving attack that
presented Robert Morris (8-15)

with difﬁculties.

“When we served aggressively,
Robert Morris was thrown off
of their offensive system,” Rens
said. “In the two sets we lost, we
pulled back on our serving and its
effects were evident.”

Actonwas also vital in this
serving effort, contributing three
aces. The Panthers totaled six
aces on the match, and Robert
Morris only managed one. '

.While Acton and Town are
often major factors in Panther
victories, other players were a so
able to show their. value to the
team in the match.

“We changed the lineup
around a little bit,” Rens said.
“From those changes, Michelle
Walker and Monica Wignot really
stepped up and played well.”

Walker, a sophomore outside
hitter, had ﬁve kills in two sets
while freshman outside hitter Wi-
gnot came off the bench to earn
four kills on four attempts. $3,.

Three of Walker’s kills came

Never? Great. Neither does anyone else.

It’s a sport that, at least recreationally,
levels the playing ﬁeldby putting everyone
in an unfamiliar situation.

That’s probably why it’s popular on col— H

lege campuses, where my Syracuse friend -

must have seen it. I haven’t even played it
yet and I’m-hooked.

Can you imagine playing defense? It’s
one big game of being caught flat-footed.
How about goaltending? You 'don’t get a
glove, and with one false step you can
careen out of the crease. ’

Whoever invented broomball must have
been a creative genius, albeit a very bored
one. When I was 9 and friends visited, it

was only a matter of time until we were
smacking pears through croquet wickets
with Wiffle Ball bats. (Tip: If you hit the
pear softly, it is less likely to explode.)
Brloomball must have been invented the ,
same way. .

Or maybe on a blustery winter day
in Alberta, a pee—wee hockey team’s bus
broke down on its way to the provincial
championship.

Having just recently watched an inspi- ‘
rational movie, the team trekked through
mountains of snow to the arena — only to
realize they’d left their equipment on the
bus. In a “never give up, never surrender”
“Galaxy Quest” moment, they took to the
ice in their boots and, armed only with
brooms pilfered from the utility closet,
emerged victorious.

Broomball Australia says the sport
dates back to the Vikings and “was one
of the roughest games invented -... often
deaths were reported from the games.”
But'that doesn’t sound like broomball to
me. Did they even have brooms back then?

_ Somebody ask a broom major. I’m sticking
with my bored genius and inspirational-
movie hypotheses.

I wish Central Oakland had an ice rink
just so broomball could be at my frozen, _
numb ﬁngertips. Yeah, an Oakland rink '
would mean Oakland hockey, too, but right
now I have broomball fever. And it takes
a strong fever to make me temporarily
disregard hockey. _ ' '

Manitoba is the world’s broomballop‘o—
lis, but the province is 1,300 miles away
from Pittsburgh, and I promised myself no
more than an eight—hour drive to obtain
my broomball experience.

Good thing the Mt. Lebanon Ice Cen-
ter, which offers the sport, is 20 minutes

. away.

With ﬁve players and a goalie per side,
the cost to rent the ice, brooms andball
will be a little over $10 per person. That
sounds like a fair deal. V

Several buses go within walking dis-
tance of the center, and nobody has to
carry skates or a stick onto one. I just
need to find 11 people whozwant to come
with me. p —. g i

so whojwants to play some broom-
ball? I ' .- ‘
