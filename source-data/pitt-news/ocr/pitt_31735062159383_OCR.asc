dergrclds Tapped by

robbing

U.S. Holds

Suspected

Thief

The arrest of a thief by the
U.S. Post Office department has
solved the looting of numerous
fraternity and sorority ‘houses
and Cathedral offices which oc-

cured over a period of two months,
beginning last September.

H. W. Glenn, a postal inspector,
reported that the arrest of Robert R-
Ferko, 23, accussed of robbing the

mails has uncovered the whereabouts
and

-of coats, cameras, wallets,
purses which were stolen from the
University area.

Ferko, whose only‘ connection
with the University was his alleged
expeditions, entered the
Cathedral and wandered through the

building, removing anything he could
find of value. His success in

the
fraternity and sorority district was
due to the hospitality of housemen,
who usually leave the door open.
He is now awaiting trial in Fed-
eral Court. _
According to Mr. Glenn, Fetl-to

pawned most of the equipment which
he stole. Ferko’s family, attempting
to make some restitution for his

misdeeds, recovered many of the

missing articles, most of which have
been identified and returned.

- However, Mr. Glenn has, not been
able to return a number of coats
which contained no identification.

He said that anyone whose coatwas

stolen could claim it in his office,
333 New Federal Building, after

making proper identification.

H. H. Green of the commercial

education department said that though
his own coat was stolen, another
one was left in its place.’ This other

one can be claimed in Mr. Green's
office, room 417 Cl.

Congress Joins

Fight Against

Trolley Rates

Student Congress may take up
where the City of Pittsburgh left
off in its fight to reduce bus and
streetcar fares.

Phylis Beck, corresponding
secretary, suggested on Monday
that Flora Diemert and Dick Kovar
investigate the possibilities of
reduced rates forvstudents. Miss
Diemert and Kovar are represent-
atives to the National Student
Association conference to be
held today at PCW.

They are to discuss the ways
and means to this end with dele-
gates of the other local schools.
Congresswoman Pat Leix pointed
out, however, that Pitt tried to
get reduced rates for students
several years ago but the Pitts-
burgh Railways Co. vetoed the
idea.

service to the institution.

The criticism was welcomed by the News,for it was advanced
in a constructive -- and by no means rancourous -- fashion. How-
ever, one point was raised with which we must take issue. It was
pointed out, in some circumstances, that the News, by publishing
articles which are uncomplimentary to the University, does a dis-

‘ J

On the contrary, we feel that the best service we can do the
Universityis to report both the school's good and bad sides. This
may prove disadvantageous to the school in isolated situations,
but in the long run it adds up to a boost. _

An honest paper is a credit to any University. Throughout the
nation there are many student publications which follow a rah-rah

policy of patting the school on the back at every occasion. Such
cream puff tactics are, we believe, an insult to the readers and
ultimately pull down the intellectual and academic respectability

of the schools.

.-

The News has attempted to present adult and straightforward
reading matter. Our efforts have been rewarded by a first place
in a national journalistic contest andan All-American rating--the

highest given -- in another. While we are harboring no illusions

of blazing our way to a Pulitzer Prize, we do feel that the afore-
mentioned awards have given us reason to believe that we have,
at least in part, accomplished our aim.

We shall continue to pursue a policy of candidness, meanwhile
welcoming criticism from both faculty and students. Such a policy
will, more than anything else, make us a credit to the institution.
And that, of course, is what we have always aimed to be.

‘Keep Record Straight

Editor,
, Pitt News

Just to keep the record straight,
I wish to point out an error in your
editorial “Before or After,” Pitt
News, November 8, 1949.
In the editorial you have stated
that Dean Biddle was called on the
carpet by Carnegie Tech officials
because of the actions of Pitt stu-
dents celebrating a. football vic-
tory on the Tech campus, hence the
open letter of apology to Dr. Do-

herty.
Dean Biddle was not "called on
the carpet,” but came voluntarily

" to Dr. Doherty with his apology.

The apology was accepted in the

 spirit it was given -— that of further-

ing relations between neighbors.

I hope this explanation will cor-
rect any misconceptions that Car-
negie Tech has tried to humble
or humiliate either Dean Biddle or
the University of Pittsburgh as im-
plied by your editorial.
~ Bert Kimmel

Editor-in-Chief
Carnegie Tartan

ED NOTE: Far be it from us to
stir up any trouble between Pitt

: and Tech, but we must defend our-
‘ selves against this charge. Con-

trary to Kimmel’s statement, we
,did not say in our editorial that
Dean Biddle was “called on the

’ carpet.” Quoting directly --- “Mem-

/bers of the Tech administration 

» had Dean ‘Biddle on the carpet ...”

In other words, as told us by the
Dean himself, he wasn’t called to
Tech «but went there and listened
to complaints from several persons
about the Pitt victory celebrants
who included the Tech campus in
their festivities. The Dean made
no inference that Tech officials
tried to humble him and, of course,
felt that, as a responsible adminis-
trator at Pitt, he must apologize

C - for the uncalled-for behavior of Pitt

students.

« P/Pitt News

I just happened to pick up a copy
of your Pitt News and noticed the
articles about having dances in
the Commons Room.

I -had wondered why the Penn
State-Pitt dance was held down
town, but now I am of the opinion

2 that all your dances are held down-‘
town. Are they "University of Pitts-
burgh” dances or "City of Pitts-
burgh” dances? Wouldn’t‘the Uni-
versity be a good place for Univer-

if sity dances? Doesn't the University

ggwant any of the money that could

possibly be saved by using Univer-
sity facilities?

Would it be disrespectful to hold
a dance‘ in the Commons Room?
Certainly you can use and appreciate
at the same time. It seems to me
that the University of Pittsburgh is
a rather cold place. Why not warm
it up? I think the Commons Room
would still be beautiful if a formal
or two were held there. That doesn’t
mean you have to installjuke boxes
and coke machines; you still have
the Tuck (.7) Shops. -

Faculty Rating Plan

Turnabout will be fair play when the students are able to grade
their instructors by mea.ns of the Faculty Rating Program which
was outlined at Monday’_s Student Congress meeting.

Congress began work on the Faculty Rating Program last year
and /is continuing the project at the suggestion of former president,

\

L arry Burwinkle.

The student legislature, through
its Faculty Rating Committee, plans
/to pre-test theprogram this semester
before installing it throughout the
University next spring. The big
question, which was left unanswered
on Monday, is to what use the rat-
ing scale results are to be applied.

Carol Nunes, chairman of the
rating committee, suggested either
turning the rating scores to the de-
partment heads or to the instruc-
tors for their own benefit.

According to Flora Diemert,
Congress president, administration
approval would be necessary to
-compel the deaprtment heads to
take action on the test findings.

Value Questioned

Howard Green berger, Men’ s “Coun-
cil representative, supported Miss
Nunes’ plan. He said that Men’s
Council conducted a test of this
kind and the results were turned
over to the faculty members for
their own use. "The test wouldn’t
be any good unless the majority
of departmentsiwere forced to use
it,” Greenberger said.

Congress also showed concern
over the Student Activity Fund and
the lack of school spirit at Pitt.

Accounting Asked

Cora Pancereve, secretary, in-
formed Congress that S 1/3 per
cent of each student’s tuition is
diverted to the Student Activity
Fund every semester. Who admin-
isters the money and where does
it go," she asked. A

'Nobody was able to answer her
questions. As a result Miss Pan-
cereve was appointed committee
head to investigate appropriations
of the Fund’s money.

Dr. John Ferguson, faculty re-
presentative to Congress, raised
the issue of poor school spirit.
According to Dr. Ferguson, the
facultywand students relations are
poles apart.

At Vassar, the instructors and
students were much closer together
and school spirit was much better,
Dr. Ferguson said. He suggested
instituting some sort of an honor
system here at Pitt. "I’m appalled
at the dirty tactics of nice girls
during tests,” Dr. Ferguson con-

cluded.

MC Weighs
Floor Plan,

Men’s Council Tuesday discussed
the possiblities of taking over the
entire eighth floor for men’s acti-
vities. Also on the agenda were
requests for appropriations from the
Debate Club and the Religion-im
Life-Week program. Both requests
were refused.

Roy Nelson, chairman of the
eighth floor committee, pointed out
the advantages of using the avail-
able space for men’s activities.
He suggested. that the Panther Room
and the adjacent hall space be
equipped with ping pong tables, a
television set, checker boards and
other recreational equipment.

The appropriation requests totaled
35 dollars. They were both turned
down on motions by Dario Icardi.

Summer

Jug Affair
Corked

The case 0fMarjorie Homan’s wine
.jug figuratively remained up in the
air today when Oakland police an-
nounced that no hearing date has
beenset forthe case,now two weeks
old.

Mrs. Paul J. Homan, mother of the
jug beaned Tri Delt sophomore, has
told the Pitt News that when the
hearing does occur, in all probabil-
ity no further damage claims will
be pressed than actual medical ex-
penses involved. ‘

Eugene Seiling, Pitt junior, was
charged with ggraevatet assault
and batteryin Oakland police station
on Nov. 19 for allegedly throwing the
half-gallon wine jug that KOed Miss
Homan while she watched the Penn
State game 20 rows in front of him.
He was later released under $2500
bond. ‘

The case as it stands now is in-
definite. No witnesses of the actual
throwingofthe jug have yet appeared.
No contact has been made for aweek
between Selling and the Homans.

Returning to her classes last
Monday, Miss Homan appeared out-
wardly not too much the worse for
wear from the incident. She reported
her biggest trouble as dodging what

-seemedto herlike "several hundred”

of,»Pitt’s journalism students who
clamored for her story for class-
room assignments.

Spring Festival Positions

lt’ll be a case of odd man out in
the race for Spring Festival exec-
utive positions if more students
don’t get up to the dean of men’s
office to apply fo; the three top
jobs of general chairman, business
manager, and publicity chairman.

According to Dick Campbell,
chairman of Student Congress Ap-
pointments Committee, only four
applications have been received
for the three jobs.

This, Campbell moans, is not
nearly enough. He claims that “at
least 20 ‘applications are necessary
for screening to determinelthe best
man for each job.” ‘

The only qualifications set for
the applicants are “some exper-
ience, and above all, some good
ideas as to how the Festival
should be conducted.”

_ Campbell stresses the fact that
if more applications do not come in
soon, there will be no Spring Fes-

 

WITH SMOKERS

 

ival next year.

In view of last year’s record-
breaking success, he thinks that
this would be “regrettable.”

The‘ appointments chairman ad-
vises all interested students to
take an elevator to the eighth floor
and get an application from Miss
Thomas in thedean of men’s office.

Decm.’s Aide Takes Off Stripes

By DAVE POLLOCK

"Kill the referee” is a term that needs no
introduction to Lester Brailey, but when an 11-
year-old girl actually started to carry it out a
few years ago, Brailey decided that it was time
to quit officiating basketball games. «

Brailey, an assistant to the dean of men, ‘had just
finished officiating an exciting high school tourna-
ment when the little girl, whose favorite team had no
doubt lost, ran up to him and, as he says, "socked
me right in the puss.”

After that incident, he gave up basketball and ex-
cept for a few football games in recent years has
practically retired from officating.

Was a Coach

A graduate of Ohio State, Brailey first took up
officiating when he was coaching high school base-
ball and football in Ohio.

"To keep from starving I went into officiating,”
he jokingly said.

Brailey was forced to give up his football work
because of toogmany other activities. He is now study-
ing for his Ph. D. in Education, besides working at
his full time job of advisor to student and fraternity

organi zation s. *-

He worked two «games this fall,

and Tech—Marietta.

“I get a kick out of officiating, especially foot-

ball,” he says.

Hoop Sport rough .
He believes that football is easier to work with
than basketball because everything is covered by
rules, while in basketball nearly every call is a matter

of judgement.

According to Brailey, the hardest thing about of-
ficiating is knowing and understanding the rules.

“There’s a lot of work in officiating. You have to
put in as much time studying therules as you would
put in on a three credit course in college,” he says.

Married and the father of two children, Brailey_’s
future whistle-tooting will be aimed at keeping his

offsprings in \hand.

Two Pitt tennis players,cJohn

burgh Tennis Association.

Lohstoeter, last year’s No. 1

while Campney, a promising sopho-
more, made the tenth spot.

Dr. O’Loughlin and Lohstoeter

Gophers Win

First Game

Displaying poor early season
form, but showing definite class,
the Gophers dumped Johnstown
Alumni 42-26, in an All StarL eague
tilt at the stadium Wednesday.

Bad Bob Badke hit the hoops for
11 points to lead the Gopher attack.
Playing against a team comprised
of last year’s Johnstown, Center
varsity, the Gophers were never
in trouble as they jumped to a
2"-9 lead at halftime.

The Gophers, winner in their
sectionlastyear, will have a tough
time duplicating ‘it this year. All
league winners in last years IM
play have been entered in the All
Star League including the power-
ful Whips. Another strong five is
the Dazzling Dukes.

Frosh to Get
Hoop Slate

Pitt’s first freshman basketball
team to have an intercollegiate
schedule since 1938 is practicing
diligently at the Stadium under the
direction of frosh coach Bobby
Artman. N

The Athletic Department is plan-
ning a ten-game schedule for the
frosh, but as yet the schedule has
not been released.

Reads Well

Artman’s team, on paper, looks
good. Such standouts as Michael
Zernich, all state center from Ali-
quippa, and six foot four inch
Jimmy Bingham from South Hills,
who holds a city record for total

points in a single game at 52, are I

on this year’s squad.

Two exceptional guards, Jerry
Montini and Paul Smith, hope to
prove themselves as valuable to
Pitt as they did in theirhigh school
playing. Montini, a guard on the
Aliquippa state champions, is noted
for his deceptive work. Although
not a high scorer, he figured in
many of the Quip games last year.

Sllith Small

Smith, a fast breaker from Wilkins-
burg High, makes up for his small
stature, 5 feet 6 inches, by his
accurate scoring from close up.

All in all the Pitt frosh are look-
ing forward to a successful season.

THREE PANTHERS-Lou Cec-
coni, Nick Bolkovac, and Bernie
Barkouskie were selected on the
Ohio State all-opponent team.

Kerr Turns Down Cecconi for T’;

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

Football’s "T" seems to re-
semble society’s afternoon tea.
Apparently there is a difference
between brands, depending on V
where and with whom you have it.

To prove the point, take’ Pitt's
Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi. Yale's Her-
man Hickman, who will coach the
Northern team in Miami’s up-and-
coming North-South game, will use
the peewee single winger in his T.
Yet Andy Kerr, head coach of the
Eastern squad in San Francisco's
East-West game, says that he would
gladly have Bimbo if it weren't for
his T-formation.

In a telephone conversation with
the News, Kerr explained why he
and his staff did not select Cec-
coni or All-American guard Bernie
Barkouskie.

Just Missed

“We'll use the T-formation,”

said Kerr. "That lets Cecconi out.

Herm Says, °I’ll Take Him for Mine’

Tuss McLaughrey. Bierman, of
course, saw Pitt battlevhis own
Minnesota club and after the game
had high praise for the Panthers,
especially for Barkouskie.

year than ever befoi-e.The game has

hip up a seance and recall the
00d Doctor from the past? Person-
ally, however, I can’t wait for the
irst game.

There is nothing in the game of
asketball more beautiful than a
mooth "possession” job. It takes
rains, patience, teamwork, and
ven trickery to hang onto the ball.
But of course these are the things
which basketball has been steadily
doing away with.

— No Troume at All

The dribble-and-shoot sport (that
s what it now amounts to) features
the automatic individual who trots
o half-floor and flips in a goal as./
ine might plink a carcheck in the
rolley box or toss a bundle down
-helaundry chute. He is the rage of
be game. He is the fellow who is
making basketball a moron’s para-
dise.
Perhaps the basic trouble with
basketball is that the payoff - the
score -- can be had by the simple '
rocess of dropping a ball through
,a hoop.
Yet the dropping is a simple pro-
cess only because today’s coaches
have made if soft for the droppers.
Carlson and Hank Iba of Oklahoma
&M are two rare exceptions. With
sharp passing and ball handling
they have made the modern robots
‘shift for their goals.

=~ Backfire

V’ Last year reputable West Virginia
"tried to mock Carlson’s club by
freezing the ball against the Pan-

 

thers. Trouble was, the Mounties
didn't know how. It was like Mrs.
Duffy’s boy Junior trying to play
"The Flight of the Bumble Bee”
on one or two fifty-cent fiddle les-
sons. The Panthers stole the ball
repeatedly and made Lee Patton’s

. men frantic.

And Pitt won the game.
Freezing is an art not to be tam-
pered with by the athletically ig-

norant. it requires study and prac-

tice. Down in the Southwest, Iba
has taught it to the Aggies and they

"have. consistently been among the

nation’s best teams.

Looking Forward
Iba’s backward boys twice trim-
med St. Louis, reputed to be the

last word in basketball last sea-_

son, and both times the high- scoring
Billikens not only lost but looked
anaemic in the scoring department.

To get back to the local picture,"

however, Carlson's gang of midgets
give every hintof a freezing winter.
A lot of people won’t warm up to
the idea. Then again, we artistic
souls are crazy about it.

honors in their respective sports.
In the annual choices made'Y_by a
board from the American Football
Coaches Association, Barkouskie
was named to the first string in to-
day’s issue of the national magazine.
Bimbo Cecconi, who along with
Bernie made the Collier All-East
team last week, was named for
honorable mention.

Lou Little, Columbia coach and a
member of the selecting board was
quoted by Collier’s as saying that
"You’d never have to worry about
team spirit so long as you had a
never-give-up kid like Barkouskie
on the club.”

Little was refering to Barkouskie’s
heroic blocked kick in the Penn
game that gave the Panthers a
22-21 win.

Coach BobVoigts ofNorthwestern
also had sweet words of praise for
the senior guard. Voigts reported
that "Barkouskie’s hard charges
disrupted our passing attack, and
his blocking figured heavily in
Pitt's ,successful reverses. He’s
smart and poised. The tougher the
situation, the better he likes it.”
DePasqua and Neilson were voted
as the most valuable players on
their respective squads, it was an-
nounced at the annual Lettermen’s
banquet at the Hotel Schenley Wed-
nesday.They were selected by their
teammates in a poll taken by The

- Owl, Pitt’s yearbook.

Their awards, gold trophies, were
presented to them by Dr. Homer
Butts, president of the Lettermen.

preparations

After several months of daily
workouts that stressed fundamen-
tals and conditioning, the empha-
sis in drills switched to the finer
points of wrestling. Imparting the
wrestling know-how that won him
champion honors at Oklahoma A&M,
Peery drilled his charges on the
refinements of the sport.

In the process Peery, who started
the season without a single ex-
perienced collegiate wrestler
among the aspiring matmen, has
found some able and willing grapp-
lers in the 35 men who work out
daily at the Stadium.

Waynesburg Rerresented

Jim Conklin, a _junior from
Waynesburg, is the top man in this
week’s rankings in the 165-pound
class. Conklin was a four-time
Pennsylvania high school cham-
pion while at Waynesburg High.

In the 155-pound division, Sopho-
more Howard Leckey ranks’ high.
Leckey, who is also from Waynes-
burg, competed with Conklin in the
state high school tournaments. An-
other standout among 155 pounders
is M-elvin Thomas, a junior from
Cannonsburg.

Frank Skirpan, 145-pound junior,
has shown best in his class.

soph Looks Good

Among. the lightweights Sopho-
more Ray Cappelli at 128 pounds
and Dan Richards, a 121 pounder,
stand out.

Clement Caughey is at the top of
ladder in the 175-pound class. A
newcomer to this group is gridder
John Coyne. Along with Nick Bol-
kovac and John Masarik, he joined
the squad after the close of the
football season. a
i Bolkovac and Masarik wrestle in
the heavyweight class. The top
pinner among the heavyweights is
Sophomore Ray Hoffman-

The leading grappler in the 136-
pound class is Frank Clark,iAa senior
from Bedford. Clark was an out-

standing performer in his weight‘-

division in high school.
Future Bright

Although the wrestlers haven't
competed for several years and
lack experience in college circles,
Peery thinks Pitt will have its
share of college wrestling glory
within the next two Years-

The fact that only one of the mat-
men who have displayed the most
promise is a senior proves that the
best of the present crop will be
around for several years. ‘

Peery said that the lack of col-
lege experience will be compen-
sated. in part by the interest, will-
ingness to learn, and the physical
condition of the grapplers.

BERNIE BARKOUSKIE is Pitt's
first All-American since Ralph Fife.

If Pitt, like its sister schools, Duquesne and Carnegie Tech,
ever gets its own radio broadcasting station, the Pitt Radio Guild
willbe all ready to take over its operation. The Radio Guild, an~
all-student group, has been reorganized to give students exper-
ience in many phases of radio production. ‘

The administration of the Univer-
sity's only student radio activityh as
been improved considerably since
last year. Previously, the Radio
Guild had confined its activities
to assisting in the recording of
speech instructor Victoria Corey*s
class projects. '

They went to KDKA’s studios
where they recorded original scripts
written by members of the class.
Their radio activities were con-
fined to acting.

Now the Radio Guild’s activities
encompass a greater sphere in the
field of radio production. In addition
to acting, the group writes, directs,
and produces radio programs. Scripts
from the Columbia Workshop and
other dramatic radio series"are pro-
duced as are original scripts.

The director of the Radio Guild
is Betty Gitelman, a junior in the
College.’ Miss Gitelman is well
qualified to lead the group in its-
activities. She wrote and produced
"Footnotes of History,” a six-
month’s series of episodesrelating

their sound of inventory taking.

nard Clerc. I

the Western State Psychiatric Hos-
pital‘ in an organized campaign to
inventory all the schools furniture
and equipment.

Power Drills and Tags A

Zahorchak and Clerc, with their
tags, power drills, and etching drills,
go after a room full of furniture like
“a Forbes Street construction gang
“goes after a stretch of good highway.
They attach metal tags with the
‘ power drills on the larger pieces and
carve the correct classification
7 numbers on the smaller pieces with
'7 the etching drills.
They buzz into a room, check
every piece of equipment in sight
against their records, and start in
tagging. Anyone interfering receives
the standard reply, "We tag all
University property."

While drilling and etching in the

 
  
    
  
   
    
  
  
  
    
   
    
   
  
    
  
  
  
    
  

starchedhead nurses stopped them
to demand, "Are you patients-or
are you working for the University?”

Job Has Laughs

_ In all they have found that the
job produces its daily quota of

r laughs. They kept the Registrar's
Office in an uproar as they swept
through. One of the secretaries in‘
in the dean of men's office still
bears.a,rnental scar from their visit
there. "

While she was engrossed in
a difficult stencil, Zahorchak crept
up behind her and jabbed the whin-
ing drillinto her chair, then beamed
innocently as he swung the now-
empty chair around to finish tagging
115.

Paper Work Headache

The paper work for the inventory
is what occupies most of Zahor-
chak’s and Clerc’s time. It is acom-
plicated one glistening with admin-
istrative red tape and involving sev-
eral recordings of all information
together with IBM cards.They must
check some records as far backinto
the dust as 1915.'°

According to Ivy the inventory

0 will probably stretch out for at least
two more years.

Only once did the inventory appear
to bog down. The day after they
finished listing everything in the
old Mines-Building it burned down
completely.

 The story had a happy ending,

I however. Bursar G.S. Rupp revealed
.later that their records together with
those of the departments, involved
gave the University invaluable in-
formation on which to base insur-
ance claims.

Meet the  
Faculty  

The FacultyRelations Committee
of Student Congress is sponsoring
a faculty student Blennd on Dec. 6,
from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. in 1228 Cl.

According to Phyllis Beck, chair-
man of the committee, this Blennd
is being sponsored to bring stu-
dents and faculty closer together.

The committee believes that the
classroom does not offer enough
opportunity for the students and
faculty to get to know each other.
These Blennds are an attempt to
remedy the situation.

A lively program based on the
Christmas theme has been pre-
pared. The room will be decorated
in red and gre.enwith be1ls,a Christ-
mas tree, and a Santa Claus. The
Pitt Singers will sing Christmas
carols.

In accordance with the student-
faculty theme, students will wear
dunce caps andifaculty members
will wear mortar boards.

Lemon Blennd, candy canes and
suckers will be served, as a com-
bination of the Blennd and Christ-
mas motifs. ‘

Students interested in attending
may leave their names with Miss
Thomas in the Dean of Men’s office.

Slates Plans A tDinne,r

Plans for Pitt’s I950 Religion-in-Life Conference appeared to
be well on the way asleaders and committee members got together
Tuesday night for dinner and a report on theprogress of confer-

ence plans.

conference were alternately fed,
instructed, exhorted, entertained,
and relieved of their money at a
dinner-meeting at the Bellefield
Presbyterian Church.

Informed that only about $200
had been received toward a $1300
budget, the diners submitted to one
of the most humorous and least
painful donation methods on record,
superintended by the (Rev. Paul
Offenhiser, and kicked in quite a
sum in cash and pledges. The re-
mainder of the budget will be se-
cured by popdar subscription and
donations from religious groups.

The committee chairmen,number-
ing about 20 in allreported on their
progress since the first meeting in
December, then listened to short
talks by Robert Sullivan and Dr.
Asher Isaacs of the economics de-
partment, and Prof. Blossom Henry
Massey, of the department ofmod-
ern languages.

Student chairmen ofithe confer-
ence are Renee Schorin, James Say,
and George Hughes.

day and hour in that month.

The calendarwill include mass
