SGA Group
Finds Women

Active at Pitt ‘

50 Women in Each
Class Lack Activities

. By JEAN THOMS

Only -about 50 women out of
each class‘ are not connected with
any of the activities sponsored by
the University, it was revealed to-
day from a survey made by a
WSGA committee. The survey re-
vealed another fact——that the soph-
omores are most active of the three
classes.

When the committee had de-
termined which of the women at
Pitt did not take part in any activi-
ties, they interviewed each girl to
ﬁnd out why she did not belong to
any group.

Reason given by most of the
girls was that she was interested in
activities, but did not know how
to get into them. Other reasons the
women gave included “Too much
home responsibility,” outside work
which demanded all the girl’s free
time, “not interested,” and the fact
that the girl commuted, and
couldn’t ﬁnd the time. A

To those women who indicated a
desire to join a group, the survey

committee gave a choice of activi-

ties. The most often-m_entioned or-
ganizations were the YWCA, and
WAA. Another much-desired ac-
tivity, wa_s..work for some branch

j of WSGA.

All Intervention

Majority Still Hope
To Keep Out of War

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN, TEX., March 28.—
Let's keep out of war!

College youth have demanded
this consistently during recent
years, and last week those inter-
viewed by Student Opinion Sur-
veys of America in a national samp-
ling again expressed the desire that

the United States should keep
away from the battle fronts. Near-
ly six out of every ten of those in-
cluded in the survey say they do
not want the U. S. Navy to inter-
vene if Japan decides to attack
British Singapore and the Dutch
East Indies.

Although 10 per cent of the na-

.tion’s students were undecided on

this issue, the remainder are divid-
ed in this fashion:
U. S. should intervene. .41 per cent
U. S. should NOT inter-
vene ~. . . .-.~  -.»~. ; . .~~.59~per cent
Singapore, is one of the largest
naval bases in the world-, and the
Dutch East Indies would be strate-

_ gically advantageous to J apan’s Far

Eastsea operations.

The present survey appears sig-
niﬁcant in that it shows American
youth of college age still cling to

-. the hope of keeping out of war,

even on the," face‘ of ever-growing
aid to Britain. The same (1eClSl0ll
was reached in February, 1940, the
found, and during that
same month students opposed com-
pulsory training. Even back in
October, 1939, majorities declared
they would not volunteer should
the United States send troops to
help England,‘ and opposed chang-
ing the neutrality law to allow any
belligerent to buy American sup-
plies.

Despite these efforts of college
students to steer clear of any for-
eign engagements, a slight major-
ity last month admitted through
the Student Opinion Surveys poll,
that they felt the United States
could not stay out of the European
conﬂict.

300 Students Hear ‘Voder’ Talk

At Demonstration of Apparatus

' Reciting the alphabet and part
of the Gettysburg address, singing
the scale and “Home on the Range,”
speaking in French and German,
the Voder performed before ap-
proximately 800 University stu-
dents and faculty in the Soldiers’
and Sailors’ memorial Wednesday.
Manipulating the keys and dials
of a console, a young woman pro-
duced sounds from an assemblage
of coils, tubes and loundspeakers
that were remarkably like a hu-
man over-enunciating through a
worn public address system.

Dr. J. Owen Perrine, assistant
vice-president of the American
Telegraph and Telephone company,
demonstrated the speech produc-
ing apparatus during his talk on
“The Artiﬁcial Creation of Speech.”

Under the direction of Dr. Per-
rine, sounds were produced by the
apparatus, ranging from simple
electrical hummings to pronounci-
ation of complicated words and
phrases.

In a short explanation of the en-
semble before the actual demon-
stration began, Dr. Perrine assert-
ed, “.Not until we got this pheno-
mena that bedeviled Edison could
speech be created electrically.”

He, explained that the phenomena
used in the Voder had baffled Edi-
son. in his research to perfect the

electric light. '

Through combinations of elec-
trical vibrations, heard as hum-
ming and whistling sounds as the
frequent scale increased, vowel
sounds and “s” sounds were pro-
duced.

Showing the development from
these elementary sounds, the Voder
“recited” the alphabet and re-
ceived a round of applause.

Repeating after Dr. Perrine, the
Voder “said” — “extemporaneous
and “incomprehensibility,” spoke
French phrases and a poem in Ger-
man, and, after the demonstrator
had twisted a dial, talked in a
shaky, high pitched voice of an
old woman.

The apparatus produced the mu-
sical scales, and sang “Home on
the Range.”

At the request of Dr. Perrine, the
machine was made to recite the
ﬁrst and last line of Lincoln’s Get-
tysburg address. It also “said,”
“Is you all from Georgia?” with a
Southern accent.

“We are adapting the simplicity
of the telegraph to the complexity
of the telephone,” declared Dr.
Perrine as he explained the im-
portance of further research with
the Voder and the possibility of
converting words spoken into a
telepphone into telegraph signals.

Amity Bowlers
Win Intramural

Championship

Exhibiting usual championship
form, the Amity Club bowlers cap-
tured their second consecutive in-
tramural crown when they topped
the keglers of Pi Lambda Phi Wed-
nesday afternoon in two straight
games. .

The Pilams had gone down to de-
feat at the hands of the Amity
Clubmen in the first round of the
championship -playoffs last week

-and Wednesday’s results were not

unexpected as. the Independents
emerged victorious by margins of
14 and. 91 pins. ~ ' "

0 Neither team produced their cus-.

tomary high -scores, but the vAmity
Club gave ample evidence of their
great competitive spirit when they
eked out a victory in the ﬁrst game.
At the start of the match it seem-
ed as though the Pilams might up-
set the dope when theyrjumpedto
an early lead, but the champions
put_on a strong ﬁnish to slip under
the wire by a score of 703-639.

The second game wasn’t even
close as the Amitymen virtually ran
awaylwith the title, winning easily,
761-670.

Emil DeLeo was high man of the
day, knocking down 201 pins in the
second and ﬁnal game. His team-
mate, Jack Henning, Al Norbut,
Ed Murphy, and Frank Franch-ini
bowled consistently good games for
the victors.

Top Electricals

Independent Ralph Fife dropped
a ﬁeld goal and a foul through the
hoop in the last ten seconds to give
his team a thrilling 32-31 victory
over the Electrical team in last
Wednesdz-1y’s all-intramural game.

The Electrical quintet got away
to a good start as Bilowich took the
center jump and tossed it to Dugan,
who ﬂipped in the opening bucket.
Orloﬁ’s free throw made the score
3-0.

“Dusty” Rhoades tipped a re-
bound into the basket and Jones
dribbled down the side and ﬂipped
one in to give the Independents a
4-3 lead.

Jones, Rhoades, and Williams
boosted the Independents’ margin
to 11-3. but Dugan dropped in two
ﬁeld goals and a foul; Bilowich
sank another. and Orloff made a
free throw to tie the score.

Tratar of the Electricals tossed a
long shot that put his team 2-rf':caI.'i.

F Elects Four
Men to Serve

In Party Group

Fraternities Choose
Steering Committee

Marking the second year they
have openly admitted control of
fraternity slates in the general stu-
dent elections, Interfraternity ‘coun-
cil members have elected four men
to serve on the steering committee
of the party for the elections this
year.

Two junior and two senior mem-
bers of the council were chosen at
the last meeting to serve on the
committee along with its ex-oﬂicio
chairman Alvin Ludwig, BA41,
Theta Chi, president of the group.
The men elected by the council,
which is composed of two repre-
sentatives from each of the 13
men’s social iraternities, are: Jack
Stauff C42, Delta Tau Delta; Rich-
ard Mansﬁeld, E42, Phi Gamma
Delta; Robert Jones, BA41, Delta
Tau Delta; and Morton Lincoif,
BA41, Phi Epsilon Pi. A

The steering committee, ﬁrst of-
ficially established last year, was
set up to be the spokesman for the
fraternity men on political matters,
to draw up tentative slates for ap-
proval by the entire membership
of the council, to make all political
contacts, to handle procedures in
meeting, and to take charge of pub-.
licity. -, 5‘ .

Lincoﬁ and Ludwig served “as
members of last year’s - pioneer
group, the ﬁrst fraternity steering-
committee which was officially-._ and
publicly organized. ‘

 

The e'n_t.rance of Interfraternity

council into an active and open

part in campus politics came last‘
a year shortly after the women’s fra-
ternities, acting‘ through Fraternity‘

Presidents’ council, voted to re-
frain from formal or informal po-
litical agreements.

proving student government on campus is a little disgusted this

week.

In fact, he’s a little angry-—or maybe we should say, plain
mad—mad at student members of Student Faculty association.

He got worked up into this condition because at last Wed-
nesday’s SFA meeting he saw a vital problem of constitutional
revision bandied about as a political football. He saw inde-
pendents voting straight down the line for all the amendments
proposed by the committee. He saw fraternity men and women

opposing it as a block.

_He knew that no matter what juicy statements were made
by independent and fraternity leaders, the way the individual

student members voted was a clear—cut demonstration that their

actions were governed by purely political motives.

tion.

The independents wanted to reduce fraternity representa-

The fraternities would not give any consideration to a plan
which diminish the number of slate positions for their houses in

the spring elections.

The student who is sincerely interested in improving student,

government at Pitt further saw that the independents, fraternity
men, faculty and administration representatives alike are com-
pletely satisﬁed with the present vague statement of the purpose
and powers of their organization. If anything. their w0rd—revi-
sion of these made a vague thing even more “va,quer."’

SFA is still a house divided. Fraternity factions still act
for fraternity interests: independent factions still act frr in-
dependent (non-fraternity) interests. Until the two have learn-
ed to act jointly for the interests of the student body. regardless

of affiliation, SFA will have no semblance of unity and no it dica-b’
tion that it is ﬁlling the conditions under which its members

were elected.

Enlightened Intellects:
The New ‘New Order’

IN ITS MEANDERINGS down through the
centuries, the middle class has held the reins
of government, regardless of the external form
of that government. Scratch a revolution and
you will ﬁnd a bourgeois. Look for a great
religious movement, a program for social re-
form, or a radically different scheme of economic
distribution; the worm that makes the jumping-
bean jump will be the middle class.

Always it has manifested itself under some
different guise. It has been, at various times,
military, ecclesiastic, economic, and just plain
leisurely.

In none of these forms has it functioned sat-
isfactorily.

Under a military set—up, the ruling members
becrme arrogant, insufferable snobs. The Spar-
tan despises anything that smacks of physical
\xr.-oz’-!l<n€SS. The military ruler shapes his ambi-
ticns at the properly symmetrical ﬁlling out of
a gilt-braid uniform.

He frames his life with a rhythm of disci-
pline. Consistency is more to be desired than
righteousness and the gleaming brass button is
the trade mark of all that is wholesome and
good. -

He lives precariously. At any time the crisis
mtrv pass, the rest of the elements in the social
pattern may realize that he is a useless. non-
contributing cog. Impossible as eternal peace
rn.ajf seem, perpetual war (or even perpetual
tension) is rvr-‘n more so.

No more successful has been the eocleaiastic
dominance. As Sarovan'.s Arab
dation, anywhere. All the way rlov<.m. the line."
In its prime, it was based upon an cl3sci.11'i1i9; of
the facts. There were four loaves of bread for
every ﬁve-men in the world; the ﬁfth man had
to be convinced of the hereafter. VVhen a
knowledge-starved world‘ scented the possibili-
ties of universal education it went on a two-
century spree, like a tiger on the hunt after its
first‘-nibble of man, meat.

Recently we have seen the power of the mid-
dle-man. Producer and distributor have been
.°*"tin"“ on tho center of a see—saw, bouncing

tlioriders of domestic_ and international policy
as they have seen fit.

The 'ore<-‘on-t rwoitalist "Wtem. ‘co“»'°*'er. roav

room for it to. do so. in which event it will lose
its "keno and. tlocrofore. its reason for existence.
Self-increasinv nrofit cannot continue to self-
increase. It wil.l expl.ode or collapse. Even after
the inevi.table course of American imperialism
has been travelled. the shape of events will
block the further growth of economic empire.

More freonent. perhans, than any of these
threo a<-mm-+,.q of the middle-class have been the
hevdavs of the leisured peoples. Fox-hunting.
pipe-smoking, and gouty. they have never ruled
rliroctlv. Theirs has been the power of o ‘oe-
hind—the-throne inﬁuen.ce. which deliw-“~<: all the
punches and takes none in return. In the ﬁnal-
i.ty, thev have always been routed by the less
leisured members of their own class.

Now we stand by and watch an entirely new
group coming into promise.

We are watching the rise. of the noon of edu-
cation, a new order predicated upon intellectual
snobbery (pride). The movement began with
the basic concept underlying President Roose-
velt’s ibrain trust and extends through to the
recent Dykstra appointment.

These are the men most coronetent to ban-
dle the affairs of government. Theirs is a ner-
spective that stretches backward upon the ﬁeld
of nast liistorv and laterally over all the areas
of the contemporary world. To anticipate. to be
able to crush out problems before thev are born
is the newest and the most valid principle of
government. Here is the material with which
to carry it out. 1 '

The question arises, Providing that they have
the power to do so. have these educators the de-
sire to administer justly?

Look about you. These professors of chem-
istry. of physics andpolitical science and English
and!bi.ology——these are the men who may some
day sit around the conference tables and ‘plot
the r_nove:ments of man. '

Life Story

With our hearts on our sleeves we announce a series
of columns by Bob Hamilton, concocted from his mem-
ory of the “good old days.” “The good old days” are
gone, but Bob isn’t, thank youknowwhom.

If I ever have any kids I think I’ll raise them in a
small town somewhere in the Ohio-Mississippi valley
region. This country is small-boy Paradise. How do
I know? Well, I used to spend one-fourth of my
year in a small river town, thank goodness. All us
great writers, me, Mark Twain, the late 0. 0. Mc-
Intyre, etc., came from river towns.

I think I was the baddest little boy that ever Was.
Huck Finn was a little bolder in some ways, but I had
more imagination and less respect for vested authority.
My summers, so far as possible, were spent in mis-
chief and out of bathtubs.

The Five of Us

There were about ﬁve of us little rufﬁans, and for
three months a year we concentrated on eating green
apples, catching turtles, devouring pawpaws, picking
blackberries, ﬁshing, building tree houses, swiping
cookies, playing strip poker, warring on wasps, smok-
ing corn—silk, stepping on rusty nails in our bare feet,
and being afraid of grave-yards after dark.

Attila’s hordes had nothing on us when it came to
devastation. We carved our initials on everything in
sight except little girls, and we tried to scalp them,
and often experimented with hanging. We caught
bees on hollyhocks by closing the ﬂower over them,
tying it shut with a bit of string and snipping it off.
The whole thing was dropped into our pockets until
the moment was ripe for stuffing the bee down some-
body’s back.

Once we went ﬁshing and brought home the better
part of a dead horse, which some farmer had dumped
into the creek to rot. Our favorite pets were vicious
little water snakes that would bite without provoca-
tion. We used to turn them loose in the movies, in a
tmvn where all kids went bare.~‘_‘oot in summer.

The River

We weren’t allowed to go to the river, so we
naturally saved our money until we had enough to
rent a boat (stolen boats usually leaked and the good
ones were always locked up). Then we would disap-
pear for an afternoon, rowing back and fozth from
the Ohio side to West Virginia, hitch-hiking on the
steamboats, pestering’ the captains, reading the pilot
rules out loud in awed voices, and suddenly discov-
ering we had been carried far downstream by the de-
ceptive, apparently slow-moving boat.-f. Blisters as big
as hen.’s eggs not uncommonly resulted from the row
back, but we would troop home shouting, sun-burned
and happy, with a vague feeling of having traveled
far and seen great things.

The state pen was on the other side of town, and
besides dark grave-yards, we feared only the prisoners
therein. Our parents often. offered to take us through
the place, but __we ‘always turned them down. We
weren’t sure, but we thought maybe the bad men would
catch us and torture us, or maybe we’d be kept for
our misdeeds.

Pablo Picasso’s Art

By Anita Pat Barone

A ow <*eneretio"s ‘wok ~‘ul_r)hm‘-and-mo-lasses was
the prescribed remedy for mid-spring lethargy.

Nowadays it’s not lethargy; it’s ennui. And vitamin
pills (A, B, C, D, E, etc.) have replaced sulphur and
molasses.

I was in a mid-season slump, and vitamin pills did
not help to pull me out of it.

In one of these just described moods, I dragged
myself over to the Carnegie institute to see what
Picasso had to say on the subject——1ife and all those
other things that begin to puzzle one in such a state
of mind.

Vitamin pills are no longer the prescribed cure-all
for my money.

Picasso has taken their place.

Forty Years of Art

Picasso doesn’t talk much. No one knows too much
about him, and most of what is known is theory. The
few words he has said publicly are considered classics.
So. very few people if any, know positively the how
and why of his art. Yet, he is probably the most famous
pai-.uter of the present day.

The exhibit, “Picasso, Forty Years of His Art,” is
a stimulating emotional and intellectual uplift. It is
over-whelming. It leaves you gasping for breath.

Don’t try to digest it in one gulp, relax and l.et all
the radiance of that rash design and riotous color
soak in like a good warm ray of sunshine.

Picasso is a panacea.

Here is a man. who has taken art, life, conventions,
politics and what-have-you, grasped them by the horns,
torn the roots up, and thrown them for a row of ten-
pins. And I don’t doubt for one minute that he didn’t
have one hell of a. good t.ime doing it. V " V I

The man is tremendously wonderful.
him his freedom.

Because of this and because of the startling forms
some of his art has taken, he has established a World‘
reputation such as few artists ever attain during their
J1-e t=noe Be “as been the inspiration for legions of
art literature, realms of newspaper copy, has been the
leading topic for discussion at all the pseudo—intel-
lectual-tea—drinking-women’s-clubs, and collectors have
scooped up his paintings like mad at fabulous prices.

The Great Art Mystery

How I envy

All the discussion, both the written word and the

spoken word, has been of a controversial nature. It
has been going on since before the First World war,
and his one-man shows such as this one only serve to
fan the ﬂame, and keep it burning through World War
the second.

. Nevertheless, Picasso is and must remain a giant
in the ﬁeld of art. It is obvious as one walks through
the present exhibit, how and why he has attained that
state. There is hardly existing a school of art that is
not represented. He has been at various times a
classicist, a cubist, an impressionist, a surrealist, and
a few unclassiﬁed “ists.” He has been a sculptor, an
etcher, a muralist, and a portraitist. He has even de-
signed sets and costumes for the ballet.

In all these ﬁelds he has shown brilliantly, even
though _ at times some have suspected a neurotic
psychosis as the only possible explanation for a few
of his more weird stabs at painting.

What I like best about Picasso is his meticulous
abandon. his wonderful color. and his excellent sense.
of design. His work is free and uninhibited, but
everything in his paintings has a purpose.

Nothing frightens him, although many things re-
pulse him such as the horrors of war shown in the
mural Guernica.

I like Picasso.

I recommend the show highly.

It will be open through April 13.

ers do not conflict with the author-
ity as deﬁned by the‘ board of

“It shall have administrative,
judicial, and advisory powers re-
lating to student life atthe Uni-
versity‘ limited only by the provi-
sions of these by-laws, insofar as
they do not conflict with the
authority of the faculty and ad-
ministration, as deﬁned by the
board of trustees.”

The power to administrate was
substituted for the power to leg-
islate when Dr. R-obert'Ayers, pro-
fessor of accounting and faculty
member of SFA, explained that leg-
islative powers were permitted only
to the board of trustees. He point-
ed out that “the faculty senate has
no legislative powers and I doubt
if this assembly has any.”

Eight Activity Boards

Discussion on ' the defeated
amendment centered on the activ-
itv representation phase. Under the
proposed and defeated amendment,
activity representation would have
been restricted to certain boards of
activities. Eight boards would
have been created. representing fra-
ternities, independents, music. pub-
lications, dramatic and forensic,
WSGA, Y, and Men’s Council.

Besides these activity representa-
tives, there would be 18 student
representatives and 4 faculty rep-
resentativee. Of the student rep-
resentatives, the plan called for
the election of six senior men and
three senior women, and six jun-
ior men and three junior women.

Thus when the Spring Elections
occur, elections will be on the same
basis as in previous years; name-
ly the election of 30 student rep-
resentatives, with 15 chosen from
the senior class and 15 from the
junior class.

Tucker’s Statement

Commenting on the treatment
of his plan, chairman Dave Tuck-
er, C4l. made the following state-
ment to News reporters: “The com-
mittee is gratiﬁed in seeing two of
the three.amendments passed. They
have brought the purpose and pow-
ers of SFA into line with its acual
program. However, the committee
was disappointed with the party
vote that met amendment regard-
ing activities representation which
was..the most important proposal.
We, the committee, feel that the
discussion was inadequate, and that
the support of the assembly in
working out the proposal insuf’ﬁci-
ent in spite of the comments that
the caliber of SFA members and
programs are improving. the com-
mittee feels the present structure
does not yet meet the needs of stu-
dent government. I, personally
feel that a progressive assembly,

‘less politically minded, will some-

day pass the third amendment.”

- Roberts’ Statement

Joe Roberts, BA4l, SFA presi-
dent. issued the following state-
mpnt;

“The majority felt that the sug-
affecting the
composition of the assembly had not
been thought out suﬂiciently to war-
rant its passage.

“There was still a doubt in the
minds of many whether the rec-
ommended boards (activity) would
adequately represent the different
activities which would be affect-
ed.

“The activities have little sym-
pathy for a student government
which could control their actions

‘for the beneﬁt of the activity sys-

tem. And this attitude is justly so
because the activity system at Pitt
is considered one of the best in the
country.”

Chatter

by Bill l‘DIcElu'ain
Sports Editor

 

Out around the Middle West they’re saying that Pitt has one
of the greatest defensive basketball teams they ’ve ever seen. Com-
ing on top of the mild unenthusiasm which locally greeted the
Panthers’ bid for national recognition, the warm reception given
Doc Carlson ’s boys in Madison, \Visconsin, last weekend was more
than satisfying.

In the ﬁrst place, it seems that the mid-Westerners weren’t
expecting a great deal from the Pittsburgh entry. Pitt’s won and
lost’ record, even though it included a victory over Big Ten cham-
pion Wisconsin, was less brilliant than other teams in the tourney,
and Badger rooters had been inclined to write off the Pitt loss as
all a mistake.

Apparently, they had considerable respect for the scoring
propensities of George Glamack, towering North Carolina all-
American. When the Panthers tied big George in knots, held him
to nine points, and stopped the Tarheels. 26-20, there were quite
a few revised opinions running around the streets of Madison.

Then, when the Pitt delegation ganged up on Badger star
‘Gene Englund and limited him to 11 points. only four of them on
field goals, the mid-western basketball fans decided that Carlson
really: had something there. True. \Visconsin won the game, 36-30,
but it was the lowest point total the Badgers had accounted for in
many a day. Incidentally, the same evening Mr. Glam-ack was
?bo1nl>arr.‘ling Dartmouth baskets for 31 points.

All in all, the “dark horse” Panthers left. the general impres-
sion that \Vestern Pennsylvania basketball will stand up well
against the best in the country.

We got checking through our schedules the other day, and
we discovered that Pitt has a bat-zeball. game scheduled at the Sta-
dium Monday against Ohio State. Now, at the moment we dis-
covered this, it was snowing and/or raining outside, and Pitt
cozicli Ralph l\Iitterling' was I"rct‘ti11g away while his charges went’
through limited workouts in the cramped conﬁnes of the indoor
practice quarters, near the Stadium ’s gate three.

This ought to prove several things: (1) that it. is fIllP.‘='rl0W“l)l€
whether the Stadium diamond will be in good condition by Mon-

day; (2) that it is questionable whether the Pitt team will be in

good condition by Monday; (3) that‘ it is questionable whether

Mitterling’s nerves will be in good condition by Monday; and (4)

’ that it is questionable whether it all makes any difference.

Should the game be played, not even the staunchest Pitt rooter
will expect a Panther vict/ory. The Buckeyes have been roaming
all over the South, getting in shape for the Big Ten season by play-

ing Southern college nines; Pitt hasn’t- even had an outdoor prac-

tice yet. Putting two and two together, we discover that‘ every-
thing points to a repetition of the Pitt.-State football game.

Pitt Rifle Team Departs
For Intercollegiate Tilts

Townsend, LaSpada, Haywood, Weisman Carry
Hopes of Underdog Pitt Squad at Washington

By V!.\'CE MATERA _
Six varsity riﬂers leave for Washington, D. C., today to com-
pete with -15 leading college riﬂe teams in the National Intercol-
legiate matches tomorrow.
V Thirteen teams will shoot in a neutral range at the capitol,
and the rest of the teams will be shooting in ﬁve other ranges scat-
tered around the country.

The team will arrive in Washing-
ton this afternoon and have a ﬁnal
tuneup practice session tonight. To-
morrow morning they will have
eliminations to decide which ﬁve
will shoot in the matches.

Hopes for the team rest on the
shoulders of Captain Jim Town-
send, senior and veteran of two
matches, and Larry Laspada, and
those who shot last year. The other
two lettermen competing are Gerry
Haywood and Joe Weisman.

This will be the ﬁrst national
for junior Bill Shuck and Bruno
Cengia, the only sophomore mak-
ing the trip. Cengia will not shoot

stant improvement in his ﬁrst year
and can easily be the surprise of
the season.

One shining light in the Pitt pic-
ture is their superiority in the
army standing position, which is
required in this match. Most of
the schools use a different stance
and must make corrections which
usually lower their scores.

Those going to Washington, in
addition to the team, are Lieuten-
ant W. R. Havlak, coach; McDon-
ald; and student manager Ralph
M. N. Hines. Coach Captain M.
U. Wills is unable to make the trip.

62 Players Report to Bowser;
Sophomore Gridders Show Well

Showing little concern over the
Panther team’s lack of training
lettermen, Coach Charles Bowser
appeared in an optimistic mood
early this week when he greeted -1
banner squad of 62 players for
spring drills.

Unwilling to make a prediction
for next season’s suicide schedule,
Coach Bowser intimated that soph-
omore players would make up the
backbone of the varsity team.

Since weather did not permit the
football players to practice outdoors
in the opening days of practice, the
squad is not quite ready for intra-
squad games. But outdoor drills
should be frequent enough next
week for the souad to participate
in their ﬁrst intra-team tilt.

Swim Records

Preparing for the coming all-
«campus intramural swimming meet,
swimming coach Ben Grady put the
independents through , their paces
last Tuesday afternoon‘ in the Trees
pool.

In the 120-yard medley, the trio
composed by Paul Kurhan, Israel
Grossman, and Sutinock bested a
trio made up of Steve Bilowich,
Tony Matero, and Pete Homnack
'by one tenth of a second. . The win-
ning time was 1213.7. ~ -

In the l00—yard free style even
Jerry Zaslov, the only swimmer
entered, ﬁnished with a poor 61.3
seconds. ‘

The 80-yard relay foursome of
the independents seems strong with
Homnack, Joel Donahue, Norty Ra-
paport, and Joe Petrone turning in
the fine time of 39.4. Last year’s
best time was 40.8.

Kurhan beat Bilowich in the 40-
yard back stroke race by two sec-
onds with 25.8 seconds as his time.
Grossman knocked three tenths of
a second from last year’s 40-yard
breast stroke time by turning in
a 27.6.

Zaslov, Rapaport, and Petrone
ﬁnished in that order in the 40-
yard free style event. Zas1ov’s
time was 22.8 with the others ﬁn-
ishing close behind.

The 160-yard relay quartet of
Mason, Donahue, Matero, and Su-
tincck showed good form and came
in only one tenth of a second be-
hind last year’s best time of 1225.2.

Mason knocked ﬁve tenths of‘ 2
second from last year’s time of 40.8
in the 60-yard individual medley.
Matero and McCafferty qualiﬁed
as the divers for the independent

; squad.

abundant on the practice ﬁeld.
Coaches Greene and Stebbins have
named three backﬁeld combina-
tions for the scrimmage sessions,
and all three look promising.

On the “A” team appear veteran
star, Edgar Jones, and Bill Dutton
at the halves, Walt West at the
quarterback post, and Johnny Ross
at the plunging spot.

Dutton and Jones have been run-
ning wild in recent scrimmages,
and a miracle would have to occur
for a reserve to replace either var-
sity candidate.

Playing for the “B” squad are
letterman Jack Stetler and Frank
Sakes on the wings, Ralph Ham-
mond at the signal calling post, and
Bob Malloy at fullback.

“Twinkletoes” Stetler was thrown
into a few varsity games last fall
and came through like a veteran.
Frank Sakes also participated in a
few varsity contests, and is spec-
ializing in the forward passing de-
partment.

The third team squad has Econ-
omos at quarter, Kerr at fullback,
and Hap Sti-ckel, Reuter, Klemczak,
or Adamchic at halfbacks.

Hopes of Game
With OSU Dim

Unless the weather in Pitts-
burgh takes an almost miraculous
change for the better, the scheduled
baseball game between Pitt and
Ohio State on Monday will be post-
poned. Up to the present time
workmen have been unable -to get
the Stadium diamond in condition
for play. _

Coach Ralph Mitterling. was
forced to cancel his plans to send
his baseballers outdoors for bat-
ting drills when a cold spell ended
the brief appearance of spring.
However, the team will probably
take to the Stadium turf on the ﬁrst
warm day.

Now that the basketball season
is ended, the Panthers will have
the undivided services of second
baseman Eddie Straloski. The high
scoring basketball ace has consid-
erable experience and should bol-
ster the shaky Panther inﬁeld. To
cop the second base position Strai-
oski will have to displace Al Hol-
brook, veteran of the past two sea-
sons.

Indications at the present time
are that the Pitt team will bank
mainly upon veterans to carry the
load in the 1941 campaign. Only
a few of the talented sophomore
athletes seem to have a chance to
break into the lineup.

current title with the best perform-
ance of his career.

At the Kansas City festivities,
Cosgrove will probably compete in
the 220 and 440-yard free style
races, besides doing backstroke
duty.

Heading the list of top contend-
ers for the National Collegiate
crown are the Big Ten champions
from the University of Michigan.
Matt Mann is expecting his boys
to collect many National titles, ‘and
he probably won’t be d’isapp‘oin‘t'et'l.

Barker has been rated as the best
50 and 100-yard sprint star in the
country. Gus Shrimet, present Na-
tional Collegiatepfree style cham-
pion, has not been defeated in dual
competition this season. Any Wol-
verine relay team always has a
head start with Sharimet swim-
ming.

Two more Big Ten title holders
will be competing for the Ann Ar-
bor entry. Skinner owns the West-
ern Conference breaststroke cham-
pionship and Welsh rates the same
standing in the 220 and 440-yard
free style groups.

Ohio State has entered only two
men in this year’s race, but in Earl
Clark and Arnold Dempsey, the
Buckeyes have two of the most
competent divers since the days of
Al Patnik.

Yale university has entered a
trio of stellar swfmmers. Johnson
took the Eastern Intercollegiate
lOO—yard free style title in the fast
time of 51.8. Bob Cook. the F-li
diver, has shown outstanding abil-
ity but is not expected to give Clark
or Dempsey of Ohio State much
trouble for springboard supremacy.

Brauer Predicts Return

Of German Democracy

Town Meeting Speaker Sees Fall
 Of Hitler in 1942, End of Own Exile

. By CHARLES CAMARATA

Predicting the return of democracy and the uprooting of national
socialism in Germany, Max Brauer, German political exile and muni-
cipal administrator, spoke before Pitt Town meeting on Wednesday and
stated that the future will see greater freedom for all peoples.

Brauer, speaking on the subject
“Freedom Faces the Future,” said
that he expects to see the down-
fall of Hitler in 1942 and when
that happens he will “take a clipper
ship back to Germany.” He has
been an exile from his native Ger-
many for eight years.

An experienced municipal ad-
ministrator and expert on political
and social sciences, Brauer is a
strong opponent of the Nazi party,
and is at present lecturing in this
country. _ .

Explaining the true signiﬁcance
of World War II, Brauer said, “This
is not a war among European pow-
ers, but a battle against irrespon-
sibility in public oiﬁces, against
slavery, inhumanity, and barbar-
ism.”

He then went on to relate the
highlights in his life as an admin-
istrator of municipal affairs and as
a member of the secretarial staff
of the League of Nations.

When he was twenty-four, Brau-
er said, he joined the army and
fought for Germany in the last
World war. Later he became the
mayor of Altona, a German city
near Hamburg, and held that of-
ﬁce for 14 years. He was also a
member of the Prussian senate for
ten years.

Brauer went on to tell how he
was ousted by the Nazi party and
ﬂed from the Gestapo for many
years over half of the continent of
Europe. He told how one day he
was listening to a radio in Switzer-
land and learned of his arrest back
in Germany.

Brauer also described his work
in China where he worked for a
number of years as the head of a
League of Nations mission to study
city and provincial governments
there.

“But,” said Brauer, “the main-
spring of my whole life has ‘been
and will continue to be the defense
of the democratic principle.” ' '

Concerning himself more speciﬁ-

 cally with present day Germany

and the Nazi party, Brauer stated
that the main issue of Nazi expan-
sion is not elimination of the Jews,
nor a total regimentation of labor.
"‘The main issue is one of re-
venge and armament, with the
View of war.

nation ‘would have felt resentment
to such. a treaty as that of Ver-
sailles,” "said Brauer.

“But as for Hitler,” continued
Brauer, ,“he only succeeded be-
cause ,_of the economic collapse of
1929,:l.5,f,'Nat_i0nal socialism in Ger-
manyjfrnade-~no advancement in the
prosperous ’period bet .een 1924
and 1929.”

Brauer stated that the American
people were fooled by Hitler’s
plebiscites, just as the rest of the
world was fooled by his simulated
opposition to communism.

“The Nazi party theory is a
German brand of bolshevism,” said
Brauer.

In conclusion, Brauer expressed
his views for the future of the pres-
ent war and the future following
the war.

Said Brauer, “My outlook for
the future is that Germany will be
ﬁnally defeated. This is certain,
because the English peoples pos-
sess over 50 per cent of the poten-
tial industry of the world, and Eng-
land has a far superior navy. I
will not promise a revolution in
Germany, but the downfall of Hit-
ler is certain to come in a few
years. I told you that I believe
in the democratic way of life, and
I believe that democracy and free-
dom for all peoples will return.”
