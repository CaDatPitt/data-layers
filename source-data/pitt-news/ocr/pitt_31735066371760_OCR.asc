Provost briefs Senate Council
on progress of F ive-year Plan

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

The first planning cycle of the uni-
versity “Five-year Plan” is “winding
down,” according to University of
Pittsburgh Provost Roger Benjamin
at the Senate Council meeting
yesterday.

Benjamin, reading a report writ-
ten by President Wesley Posvar,
stated that the contact persons for
the various schools and departments
within the university have been
receiving responses to the plan’s
recommendations.

The contact persons, who are per-
sonnel in the provost’s office and in
the office of the health sciences
senior vice president, are collecting

The Swinburne Bridge has been sche-

vience many Pitt commuters.

Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri
informs the Pitt Board of Trustees of his
support of South African divestment. A
student government questionnaire
shows Pitt faculty are also in support of

rebuttals and criticisms of the plan
from representatives of the targeted
schools and departments.

“There are a lot of creative ideas
and proposals which are being for-
mulated and are at various stages,”
Benjamin said. _

Benjamin also stated that a tenta-
tive timetable has been set for phase
four of the plan. Early in March, the
Ad Hoc Monitoring Committee and
the University Senate will meet to
discuss -further the recommenda-
tions. “This will be a procedure by
which we will give everybody a
chance to express their views about
specific items in the final recommen-
dations or the overall philosophy
and goals as represented in the docu-
ment,” Benjamin said. "

Benjamin added that timing A is
important in the planning process.

“We are determined to move
through a whole set of problems,
which may or may not cause us some
calendar problems,” he said.

“I want to make sure,” Benjamin
explained, “that when we put out a
set of recommendations to any par-
ticular school, those recommenda-
are well-constructed,
well-written, and well-thought-out.
To the best of our ability, we are
going to try and meet that
timetable.”

Benjamin plans to make his final
recommendations to Posvar some-
time in March. a

In an effort to keep the faculty of
Pitt's regional campuses informed of
the ongoing planning process, Ben-

Speaker tells of

fall of military
rule in Brazil

By Michael Fay
The Pitt News

Brazil's president-elect Tancredo
Neves, whose election ended a 21
year military rule, will have to make
major conciliations in order to
organize his new Social Democratic
government, according to a speaker
yesterday for the Center for Latin
American Studies.

Enrique Amayo, a Pitt Ph. D. can-
didate from Peru, who recently
returned from a trip to Brazil said
the need for these conciliations is
due to the broad scope of Neves’
support. His supporters, Amayo
explained, cover the entire political
spectrum from right-wing indus-
trialists to communists. .

“The struggle [for power within
the new government] is running
deep,” he said. He added that the
opportunity for change within the
government is significant but will
depend upon how the power falls.
All of this will become apparent, he
said, as positions of importance are
filled.

According to Neves, the indus-
trialists and bankers, who finally
abandoned the military government
in favor of Neves, (are allowed to
takeicontrol of the economy) little
will change.

Amayo explained that the major
difference between Neves’ philo-
sophy and that of the military
government is in their emphasis on
politics. Neves, he said, puts great

- stock in politics. He went so far as to

say that Neves is -considered to be
one of the greatest Brazilian politi-
cians of the century. According to
Amayo, he will have a chance to
demonstrate his great skill in dealing
with Brazil's many problems. '
The most significant of these

' negotiations

problems will be paying back Bra-
zil’s enormous foreign debt, which
exceeds $100 billion,‘ Amayo
explained. However, be com-
mented, Neves seems more con-
cerned with internal issues such as
the 40 percent unemployment and
220 percent inﬂation rates. He
quoted Neves as saying that he will
pay the foreign debt, but not at a
great expenselto the people.
Amayo also stated that Neves has
already been very active in establish-
ing himself and “showing that he's in
charge” even though he will not offi-
cially be inaugurated until March
15. In his victory speech, Amayo
said, Neves took a strong stance in
vowing to support “all democratic

movements in Latin America.”This,

Amayo stated, was surprising
because, “no president has been so
aggresive [in foreign policy].” He
added that the president-elect wants
to both establish Brazilian Policy as
independent and improve relations
with other Latin American countries
and the west.

To improve his public image and
to gain external support, Amayo
said, Neves traveled through Latin
America, Western Europe and the
United States. During this trip,
according to Amayo, Neves hoped

to gain support in his battle to erase

the foreign debt. Neves also dis-
cussed the possibility ofjoining with
other debtor nations such as Mexico
and Argentina to form a coalition
that would have more power in
for better payment
terms, according to Amayo.

One thing, Amayo commented,
that surprised many people about
Neves’ victory and the period of
transition (which is still underway)
is the peacefulness with which it
has occured, in spite of right-wing
militarists’ attempts to provoke
unrest. ’ I

Education dean
sought by task force

By Susan Benedek
For the Pitt News

A committee set up to search for a
new dean for the School of Educa-
tion discussed tile need to entice elig-
ible persons at its third open meeting
Monday.

“There exists a pervasive feeling,
external to the universitv, that the
School of Education is not the place

to go,” explained Naomi Zigmond,
chairman of the search committee.
“This misperception disinterests the

potentially strong candidate.”

The search committee intends to
“do some selling” in order to attract
potential candidates and overcome
those misperceptions. “Lots of peo-
ple are not enthusiastic about Pitts-
burgh, so we will have to do some
selling on a number of levels,” Zig-
mond said. i

To attract applicants, the commit-
tee “will distribute literature,” said
committee member Nicholas Defi-
gio, who questioned the ethics of
“selling.”

The results of a faculty question-
naire concerning divestment are in
and show that, by a margin of six to
one, Pitt professors are in favor of
the withdrawal of university funds
from South Africa.

John Leopold, chairman of the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee which performed the survey, said
that the study was done to inform
the Student Government Board of
how the faculty felt about the
board’s plan to urge the Board of
Trustees to divest. “We wanted to
show the feeling ofthe whole univer-
sity community,” Leopold said.

Eighteen hundred questionnaires
were sent out to all full- and part-
time faculty, except those teaching
at the law and medical schools. The

Governmental Relations Commit-
tee worked from the United Faculty
Mailing List. The surveys went out
Jan. 10.

Responses of faculty not only
showed their support for university
divestment in South Africa, but also
typically praised the SGB for its
efforts. Richard Blackett of the
black studies department com-
mented, “SGB should be .com-
mended for this effort.”

Another response from a faculty
member in the Spanish department
stated, “Ownership of South Afri-
can stocks by the University of Pitts-
burgh is incompatible with its stated
commitment as an institution of
higher education.”

Faculty member Jose Marino
echoed the sentiments of the SGB in
his comments on the questionnaire.
Marino said,“Students and faculty
should work together on total div-
estment of South Africa.”

When asked whether he thought
the questionnaire would have any
effect on the administration, Black-
ett said,“They can't ignore it if the
faculty comes out in support of
divestment.”

Leopold also thought that the
measure would be effective in the
SGB’s fight for divestment. The
information obtained from the ques-
tionnaires will be used as support for
the board's position on divestment
when they make their presentation
at the Board of Trustees meeting this
week.

The faculty were not alone in their
praise of SGB’s request for total div-
estment, according to Leopold.
When the members of the Govern-
mental Relations Committee tra-

- veled to Harrisburg last Monday,

they were praised for the work they
have been doing regarding South

Mayor Caliguiri urges
Board of Trustees to divest

The Pitt Divestment Campaign, a coalition of individuals and groups favoring South African divestment
at the University of Pittsburgh, today received support for their efforts from Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri, an
ex-officio member of the board of trustees of the university.

In his letter addressed to the board of trustees, the mayor stated, “I believe the curtailment of financial
involvement with South Africa can be a most effective way of getting our message across to its leaders. To
add greater impact to this effort, I feel that other segments of the Pittsburgh community should consider
taking similar action against the apartheid policies.

“As mayor and member of the University of Pittsburgh's board of trustees, I would ask the board to
determine the feasibility of divesting the university of any financial involvement it has with South Africa. The
repugnant apartheid policies in South Africa are of community-wide concern and I believe the university
should take a definitive position in opposing it.”

The mayor’s statement was obtained through the efforts of Chuck Pascal J r., a Democratic committeeman
from Oakland who has been working with the campaign.

Pascal said, “As a Pitt student myself, I’m happy to see that the mayor is standing up and openly
supporting the efforts of the students and faculty at the university. '

“In addition, that the mayor saw fit to stick his neck out on this issue before the Democratic endorsement
for mayor next Sunday is admirable and should be applauded and recognized.”

Avery Abrams, a member of the divestment campaign and the SGB, will present a proposal tomorrow to

Of the Mayor’s letter, Abrams said, “It is heartening to know that our efforts are being supported by the
mayor. His support will prove to be important because he is well-respected by and has a good relationship
with many of the corporate leaders who also sit on the board of trustees.”

The divestment campaign here at the university has also received supportive statements from House
Speaker K. Leroy Irvis and State Senator Edward P. Zemprelli, who are also members of the board of

For the past three years, Heming-
way’s Cafe, in conjunction with the
Pitt writing program, has been pre-
senting the Tuesday Night Read-
ings. At 8:30 p.m. Hemingway’s
invites the public for a night of fic-
tion and poetry.

“A lot of people show up, usually
a crowd of 60 to I00," said Heming-
way’s representative Debbie Ban-
kert. “There is a lot of student
interest. We provide a relaxed
atmosphere. People feel more com-
fortable listening to the readings in a
public place rather than inside a
classroom. Not only students
attend, but also graduate students
and professionals. We attract a
diversified group of individuals."

The readings benefit the univer-
sity community educationally and
help Hemingway’s economically.
“Many people who attend the read-
ings enjoy the atmosphere of the
back room, generating business for
private bookings,” Bankert said.

Hemingway’s Cafe has limited
involvement in the operation of the
readings, providing the room, a mic-
rophone and a waitress. When asked
to comment on the readings, one
student replied: “It’s a nice place; the
poems are good. After youlisten to
the first poem, it's hard to concen-
trate on the next one because you’re
still contempla_ting the previous
poem. They really make you think.”

“I attend as many readings as I
can. Lately, there has been a
standing-room-only crowd,” com-
mented another member of the
audience. ‘

Two different readers are featured
weekly. Future readers include
Frank Lehner and Kevin Rippin,
both reading poetry on Feb. I9; Eli-
zabeth Drescher reading poetry and
Mary Moody ' reading fiction on
Feb. 26; and John Repp and Linda

A Loss of Integrity

Last Sunday, the Association of American Colleges issued a
report entitled “Integrity in the College Curriculum.” Accord-
ing to an Associated Press news release, the association

A declared: “The curriculum has given way to a marketplace

philosophy —-— it is a supermarket where students are shoppers
and professors are merchants of learning. Fads and fashions
enter where wisdom and experience should prevail.”

The association also wrote, “We have reached the point at
which we are more confident about the length of a college
education than its content and purpose." Nowhere are the
association's findings more truthful than at the University of

Pittsburgh.

During last term’s accreditation of the occupational therapy
school, three occupational therapy students proposed that a
physiology class designed for Health Related Professions stu-
dents that OT students were required to take be expanded to a
two-term class. Jerome Martin, the vice president of Health
Related Professions, told the three students that physiology
classes are difficult no matter where one goes and that they
didn’t understand “the way the school works.”

Those same students, along with several other classmates,
asked an accreditation official whether it would be possible to
stretch the occupational therapy program from a two-year
program to a three-year program. They said that their reason
for such a request was that there is so much material presented
in so short a time that it is difficult to remember it for any time
longer than that required to pass a test. Dr. Martin said that the
accreditation official responded that that was a “philosophical

matter.”

Last fall, a student asked a math TA to explain the derivation
of a formula and was told that “this is not a theories class — just
memorize this, so we can move on to other things.”

Students are not entirely without blame for this pitiful state
of what passes for a modern education. They strive to gain
admission to the most prestigious institutions, and, once there,

— drive themselves into a state of ill health worrying over grades,

and building a “respectable” transcript. Unless a union of
college students and administrators agrees to return themselves
to dedication to the idea of education as an end, rather than a
means to an end, the minds of American college students -
and America at large — shall suffer a great loss.

Letters to the Editor

  No Original Sin

(Editor’s Note: This letter was read
on WPTS FM on Feb. 12.)

Last Wednesday. Feb. 6, you, The
Pitt News editorial staff, published a
poll to determine whom Pitt stu-
dents preferred —— former Chancel-
lor Litchfield or current President
Wesley Posvar. The spread featured
statements made by each, reflecting
some of the two contestants’ ideas
on the role of the university in Amer-
ican society.

Though the printed remarks
(which did not derogate either party)
were not broad enough to be called
“the university's mission," by the
same token they were not narrow
enough to be considered “funda-
mental” errors, as they were labeled
in the retraction printed in the Feb. 8
edition of The Pitt News.

You expressed regret that the
president was never consulted to
confirm what, indeed, is his mission
for the university. But you neglected
to apologize to Chancellor Litch-
field —- and I have serious doubts
that he was consulted either, as he
died in 1968.

As I understood it, the poll was
not to determine whose “university
mission” was better, but rather to
determine whom the students would
prefer as president of the university.
This poll would have allowed the
students to voice their opinions
about President Posvar and his poli-
cies. Although the statement cited
was not a statement of President’s
Posvar’s “mission,” is that any rea-
son to invalidate the poll?

Though a more plausible scenario
(such as a referendum on the popu-
larity of the Five-Year Plan) might
have been more effective, this lack of
effectiveness does not seem to merit
an invalidation. The display was not
presented in an offensive manner, as
other editorials have been. For
example, the “air force mafia” edi-
torials alleged that President Pos-

' var’s administration was “assembled

on the basis of nepotism."

What does all of this mean? The
editorial entitled “Your Free Voice”
(Jan. 30) proclaimed that “if dis-
agreement were presented orally, in
private, and resulted in a threat to
the autonomy to which The Pitt
News is, by charter, entitled, this
would be an attempt to control the
editorial content of the newspaper.”
No letter to the editor accompanied
the retraction, though Monday's
(Feb. ll) apology to Daniel Berri-
gan was accompanied by a letter.
This suggests to me that a disagree-

ment was presented verbally and in
private, which is “an attempt to con-
trol the editorial content of the
newspaper.”

I and, I think, most of your read-
ers feel as John Picone said he felt in
the Jan. 30 issue: The Pitt News is
laughable sometimes, for different
reasons, but they generally don‘t sell
out to the administration."

This is something you and all Pitt
students should be proud of. Don’t
disappoint us, your peers, or Presi-
dent Posvar, who deserves to know
exactly how popular he and his Five-

Year Plan really are. Rephrase the '

poll and run it again. Don't desert
the university community. We
depend on you.

Liberal Error

Why is it that whenever liberals
want to eliminate waste in the
government’s budget, they only look
at defense spending (“God Save
America,” The Pitt News, Feb. 4)?

According to your own statistics,

no less than 64.8 percent of the fed-
eral budget will be spent in other
ways, including wasteful programs
such as the Social Security pyramid
scheme and fat pensions for “civil
servants.”

At least one out of six Americans
works for the government, but prob-
ably not for the military. If you want
to cut government spending, start
laying off bureaucrats, saving us
their salaries today and their pen-
sions tomorrow.

Welfare and Medicare are not
only wasteful, but are based on the
false premise that people deserve
something simply because they
“need” it, as opposed to working for
it and earning it. Such programs
reward those who do not produce
wealth and punish those who do;
only the recipients and social
workers benefit from this form of
domestic spending. Defense spend-
ing, on the other hand, has one
redeeming feature that most other
programs do not: It is one of the few
instances in which the government
takes money from all the taxpayers
and spends it helping all the taxpay-
ers.

Perhaps you do not realize that in
a free society the government has
only three functions: to maintain
sufficient military force to provide
defense from hostile countries, to
support a police force to protect us
from criminals, and to operate a
judicial system so we can settle civil
and criminal cases in court instead

I

of through feuds and vendettas. If
our government performed only
these functions, our taxes would be
lower, our standard of living would
be higher, and our national debt (if
we had one) would not be in the
neighborhood of $2 trillion.

Since young liberals are always
talking about “new ideas,” try this
one: Eliminate all government
spending not related to these three
functions, cut the waste from what's
left, hold taxes right where they are,
and use the surplus revenue to pay
that whopping national debt. We
could do it by the end of the century
— and once we’ve done it, we could
cut our taxes by perhaps as much as
two-thirds of what we’re paying
now.

“But Mr. Bold, who would help
the poor if we tried that?" If you
wanted to help them, I wouldn’t stop
you.

No rational philosophy has ever
taught that the productive individu-
al’s duty is to ensure the survival of
those who could be working but are
not. Those who claim a “right” to
free food, free housing, free medical
care or a free education are claiming
the “right” to someone else’s earn-
ings. lt’s time the kids at The Pitt
News grew up and abandoned the
ethics of the parasite.

Self-righteous

The almost unbelievable arro-
gance of Tim Hunter (“No Choice,”
Jan. 30) in reference to an issue
about which it is obvious that per-
sons of good will do disagree, typi-
fies the problem with the
right-to-life movement: the appar-
ent inability of self-centered, self-
righteous doctrinaires to conceive of
any other viewpoint that their own

-«or to accord the honestly held opin-

ions of others the respect due them.
As for forcing beliefs on others, it is
societal consensus, obtained via
freedom plus persuasion, that out-
laws most murders. Coercion will
never end abortion — but if Mr.
Hunter feels strongly enough, per-
haps he'll join a family planning
clinic and explain. to pregnant
women the moral imperatives of
bearing children and where they’ll
find the resources to care for them. .It
IS. uniikely'he will ever face such a

From the Foul Line/A Mark A. Sindler

Now that the Provost’s Office has
temporarily donned a straitjacket
after recently purging several of
Pitt’s specialty schools, the univer-
sity can proudly attest to upstaging
the school of the cerebrally advan-
taged, Harvard.

Bearers of the Crimson stumbled
into the spotlight, an irritating black
light, for inauspicious reasons last
week. A tenured professor resigned
over charges of sexual harassment.
It caused quite a fuss, though there
are no sightings yet of bearers of
scarlet letters.

Seemingly, this could never
happen at familial Pitt, where eve-
ryone looks out for everyone else’s
best welfare. If — perish the thought
— someone might get frisky, violet-
lettered signs nip him in the bud.
Cropping up, they scream, “THE
UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
PROHIBITS SEXUAL HAR-
ASSMENT.”

After anguishing for three years
over the administration's wavering

position on such a touchy matter, I
can now rest assured. There is an
emergency hotline at my fingertips.
Harassees can avail themselves of
confidential counseling. And Uncle
Sam stands behind his latest stance.

Yet, anytime Washingtonian po-
liticizing enters into the picture,
static blurs the reception. Soon the
fine people who depend on Pitt for
their very employment oracademic
enrichment will be confronted with
more university crusades. Imagine:
“THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTS-
BURGH PROHIBITS FIRST
DEGREE MURDER.”

Since there has been a lull in Pro-
vost Roger Benjamin's office lately,
the budget-cutting ledger sitting
unattended, why just stop with sex-
ual harassment? In the interest of
better serving an already under-
catered-to university community, a
broader list has been asssembled.

Prohibit antitrust practices at
Schenley Cafe. To eradicate such
morning specials as pancakes and

syrup for $5.95, a regulatory com-
mission would enforce pricing
guidelines. The University Senate
would establish a toll-free number
for victimized patrons that patches
into President Posvar’s chambers.

Prohibit unaccountable slashings
of departments. This would require
bringing in Pitt’s board of trustees,
but not as it functions now. While
ousting present board members
from their stuffy, smoke-filled
room, an electoral college would be
formed to establish campus-wide
suffrage. Since everyone except
athletic department officials would
vote for pre-determined candidates,
those elected would stand accounta-
ble to the people. By the way, who
could ever imagine the Pitt athletic
department being slashed?

Prohibit overt defacing of library
property with different penalties for
different offenders. Those found
carving their lovers’ names or favor-
ite Obscenities into the oak tables
would be sentenced to eat a meal in

Sunshine in the Shade_/ Dirk Kaufman
Mr. Reagan’s latest fop

It seems that William J. Bennett,
recently appointed secretary of edu-
cation, has made a strong move
toward becoming the James Watt of
Reagan’s second term.

At his first press conference, he
announced wholehearted support
for the cuts in education in President
Reagan’s latest budget proposal.
These cuts limit eligibility for federal
aid to applicants whose parents earn
less than $32,500 a year. Also, eligi-
ble students would be limited to
$4000 dollars per year in federal aid.
Finally, students whose parents earn
over $25,000 a year would be ineligi-
ble for grants, work-study jobs and
any other available aid. ‘

Bennett’s support ofthese propos-
als is not necessarily a bad thing.
After all, the president gave him his
job. It is the bumbling manner in

, which Bennett voiced his support

that I find hard to believe.

At the press conference, Bennett
said that two things would result
from the cuts: (1) Families that are
already in tight financial straits will
need “to tighten the belt even
further," and (2) the cuts may force
some students to give up their stere-
os, cars and beach vacations.

This reeks of the same incredible
lack of tact that James Watt used
when addressing environmental
issues.

If there's anything I know about
college life, it's that filling out finan-
cial aid forms is somewhere between
cafeteria food and waiting in add/-
drop lines on the student's list of
“Things I love about college.” The
belts of those who have the patience
to complete these forms are already
at the last cinch.

The concept of “tightening the
belt even further” for those who find
federal aid necessary right now is a
very difficult thing to consider. It’s
unfair to say to a family, “Look, we
know each of you has a life to lead,
but we all have to sacrifice so that
John can finish his schooling.” It’s
also ironic that the man whose plan

the Towers cafeteria. Those found
riffling a bag of Dorito’s would be
forced to stand on the corner of Bou-
quet and Forbes one weekend night
while Oakland's riffraff make their
rounds. And those who raise their
grubby feet onto tables or chairs
would be assigneda place in next
year’s family portrait of the Posvars.

Prohibit the cavalier practices of
south Oakland landlords. You
wouldn't want to deport them
because the riffraff are already
needed as a means of penalizing
other offenders. Again, a regulatory
agency would be required. Drawn
into its bylaws would be limits on
rents that already surpass Third
World per capita rates; quotas on
the number of other allowable living
inhabitants; and mandated provi-
sions of presently unavailable neces-
sities such as air ducts, workable
plumbing fixtures and locks that
don’t need hairpins to open. As a
protective device. an amendment

Bennett supports so strongly said in
his State of the Union address that
the virtues of “family” were keeping
America strong. How can he say this
and then propose a plan that would
weaken the foundations of the fam-
ily? To ask of these people that they
tighten the belt even further is
ludicrous.

Next is the statement that the stu-
dent will have to give up his stereo,
car and perennial trips to the beach
so that he will be able to pay his own
way.

I must say, at the risk ofsounding
homely, that I’ve never been to the
beach and I don't own a stereo. My
parents have to fund any repairs that
are done to my car which, by the
way, is sitting at home in the
driveway.

I never knew (until Bennett made
his statement) that college students
were so afﬂuent. All this time, stu-
dents have been traveling to the
beach every spring on federal money

ble movie called “Spring Break”that
came out a while back. Perhaps this
is his sole source also.

Whatever the fate of the budget
cuts, I already feel a ﬂickering hope
inside me that Mr. Bennett will meet
the same fate as Mr. Watt. Judging
from his actions since assuming the

.. job, he and his lack of foresight will

feed that hope until it is indeed
realized.

Swinburne Street Bridge
Scheduled for demolition ~

By Bryan Lee
The Pitt News

The six-year development pro-
gram approved by City Council last
year calls for the demolition of the
Swinburne Street Bridge, which
connects south Oakland with Green-
field and Second avenues in Hazel-
wood. Its destruction will prove to
be an inconvenience for the many
university students and employees
commuting from West Mifﬂin and
the South Hills via the Greenwood
Bridge and Second Avenue through
Hazelwood, according to Jay Rol-
ing, assistant to the vice president
for public affairs at Pitt.

The city had three options,
according to Rich Connors, the
engineer with the city planning
office who inspected the bridge. A

new bridge could be constructed at a
projected cost of $2.75 million; spot
repairs costing $500,000 could main-
tain the bridge for another five to 10
years; or the bridge could be demol-
ished for $400,000. The city chose to
demolish the bridge as the most cost-
effective solution.

“Traffic counts we had done show
that people rarely use the bridge,”
said Terry Lawrence ofthe city plan-
ning office. “We don’t think the
bridge is needed anymore.”

Lawrence said commuters from
Second Avenue in Hazelwood who
now rely on the Swinburne Street
Bridge (also called the Frazier
Bridge) can either take Bates Street
or continue up Greenfield Avenue
and take the Greenfield Bridge into
Schenley Park to get to Oakland.

“I have a hard time agreeing with
the city’s logic,” Roling said, stating
that Swinburne Street is the most
direct route into Oakland. The

Greenfield Bridge is a “circuitous”
route, he said, and the bridge demo-
lition will coincide with the next
phase of the Parkway East renova-
tion, which calls for a detour of
Parkway traffic onto Bates Street to
the Boulevard of the Allies.

“Half the world will be coming in
Bates Street,” said Roling.

He added that the Schenley Park
detour will also be a problem since
the Anderson‘ Bridge, which links
the Boulevard of the Allies with
Schenley Park near Dawson Street,
is scheduled for renovation at that
time.

Roling plans to lobby the city to
keep the bridge. He said all commut-
ers who would be affected by the
shutdown of the bridge should con-
tact his office at 624-6254.

“Who knows?” said Connors. “If
there’s enough pressure, maybe we’ll
reconsider.”

Valentines Show Signs of the
times; themes less romantic

Looked at Valentine’s Day cards
lately? You can still find the tradi-
tional kind, but there are some new,
different, ones as this special report
from UPI tells.

The first valentines in America
were exchanged during pre-
revolutionary days. These colonial
creations were mostly hand-made
and notable for their graceful pen-
and-ink drawings.

Today’s valentines are a far cry
from those highly sentimental
verses, written in flowing script.
Some of the cards are now targeted
toward co-habitating couples as well
as the “typical” family.

Halle Conway, product manager
at American Greetings, said the val-

entine of yesteryear may have
alluded to passion and desire, but
today’s is more likely to say some-
thing about sharing.

Conway said a card for two peo-
ple living together may read, “I guess
I‘ve sort of gotten used to having you
around  That’s as close as you’ll get
me to admitting that I’m crazily in
love with you.”

And there are other changes as
well. While Cupid, lace hearts and
the color red were once popular
symbols of a Valentine’s Day ro-
mance, today’s market offers them
as a compliment to simple line draw-
ings, updated graphics and a new
line of pastel colors.

The card has even broadened to

include computer voices and sound
effects. One card on the market
depicts two animals staring into
each other’s eyes and reads, “Valen-
tine, I love you  you’re my‘ kind of
animal.” Then a growling mating
call shrieks from the card’s speaker.

Hotlines hot
after "TV movie

(UPI) -—— Several suicide hotlines
across the country were ﬂooded with
calls from youngsters after a TV
movie about teenage suicide and its
effect on families.

The switchboard in Miami
reported about 30 calls in the first
hour Sunday night following the
ABC movie “Surviving.” Switch-
board staffer Jorge Arocha said
most callers were in their 20s and
teens and about half were Hispanic.
Most said they’d been considering
suicide but began to think after the
film.

Arocha said: “We think movies
like this are helpful. Many people
think if you talk to them about sui-
cide, that will drive them to suicide
and that’s not true.” At the Sui-
cide Prevention Center in Los
Angeles, Pat Pilkenton said phones
were “ringing offthe hook."She said
the number of phone calls increased
during commercial breaks in the
movie. Pilkenton said at least halfa
dozen callers were teenagers who
wanted to talk about suicidal
feelings.

Since 1970, the suicide rate for IS-
to I9-year-olds has shot up 44 per-
cent compared to an increase ofonly
2.6 percent for the population as a
whole.

Conrail to stay
based in Philly

NORFOLK, Va. (UPI) —— The
chairman of Norfolk Southern Cor-
poration, Robert Claytor, said yes-
terday that the company will keep
Conrail’s headquarters in Philadel-
phia if it is successful in purchasing
the railroad. I

Claytor also told a news confer-
ence that Norfolk Southern’s pur-
chase of Conrail would have no

major impact on area employment.

Claytor said he made the assuran-
ces to Mayor Wilson Goode and
other local officials at a two-hour
meeting. Goode did not attend the
news briefing with Claytor.

Claytor told reporters he plans to
have Conrail operate as a full
partner with Norfolk Southern‘s
other subsidiaries -— the Norfolk
and Western Railway and the
Southern Railway System.

The U.S. Department of Trans-
portation announced Friday it
wants to sell its 85 percent owner-
ship interest in Conrail to the
Virginia-based corporation. Con-
gress, however, must approve any
sale, and area congressmen have
said they will fight the choice ofNor-
folk Southern.

Claytor said he hopes the Conrail
purchase can be completed by mid-
year.

‘Torchlight’ star
knows her stuff

(UPI) — Pamela Sue Martin, the
onetime dimpled darling of the
“Nancy Drew Mysteries”and “Dyn-
asty” TV series, has written and stars
in a hard-hitting movie about
cocaine.

Now in her early 303, Martin
knows her subject. She once experi-
mented with potent drugs, she said,
and has seen enough drug use
among friends and acquaintances to
last a lifetime. The destructive pow-
ers of drugs convinced her three
years ago to write the script for
“Torchlight,” due for release this
month.

Martin said “Torchlight” isn’t
about the ’60s, but it deals with the
past decade and the runaway use of
cocaine. She said the characters
include professional men and
women, doctors, lawyers and execu-
tives being introduced to cocaine
socially.

middle-class businessman who
seems to have the perfect marriage
and a bright future until her hus-
band becomes a coke fiend. The
addiction ruins their personal rela-
tionship, destroys his business and
eventually ends in catastrophe.

Martin said, “we're not trying to

audiences. She called it “a subtle
story of what happens to people
involved with drugs."

Dollar K05
European money

(UPI) -— The dollar's the story.
Once again it sent European curren-
cies reeling like punch-drunk
fighters.

.The_greenback finished at record
highs in Britain, France and Italy,
despite a minor sell-off spurred by
nervousness over the dollars high
levels.

Tourists enjoy
strong dollar

(UPI) m The pound sterling
dipped below $1.10 for the first time
ever. That’s good news for American
tourists, at least.

In Italy, the buck stopped above
2,000 Lire. In France, the dollar
bought 9.97 francs. In West Ger-
many the dollar was at its highest
since December 1971. In Switzer-
land it was at a 10 year high against
the Swiss franc.

Dealers attribute the latest surge
to a few buyers. One dealer for a
major bank says those dealers wil-
ling to sell are making the buyer pay
through the nose.

Although money is still ﬂowing in
from abroad, some investment
houses report what could be the
beginnings of a shift from US and
Canadian investments to the British
pound. The reason is high interest
rates in the UK.

Pitt YMCA volunteers provide
friendship for troubled youth

By Lynne Recktenwald
For the Pitt News

When a child or teenager is placed
in a shelter or detention center, the
experience is probably one of the
most traumatic times he’ll face —
alone. It is vital that he have some-
one to talk to or to be his friend,
rather than someone who will coun-
sel or preach to him. Volunteers at
the Pitt YMCA provide children at
the Shuman Center and the McIn-
tyre Shelter with this friendship.

Under the auspices of the Oak-
land chapter of the YMCA, located
on the seventh floor of the William
Pitt Union, approximately 230 stu-
dents are put in touch with the
young people through a variety of
programs. Projects vary from talk-
ing with the boys at Shuman Center
and arranging activities for the
young people at Mclntyre Shelter to

working with blind children and a
Big Brother/ Big Sister program. In
addition, the YMCA sponsors a day
camp, a tutoring program, a Work
Relief Center where women are

taught new skills and a program that

works with deaf children.

Programs like these are time con-
suming; commitment is necessary.
In exchange for this dedication, stu-
dents earn solid volunteer expe-
rience. According to Nancy Wells,
one of the directors of the Pitt
YMCA, such experience is a valua-
ble asset. Wells said that the YMCA
can develop a young person’s leader-
ship potential. A volunteer student
coordinator recruits, trains new
volunteers, makes arrangements for
transporting volunteers to the cen-
ters and confirmsthat volunteers are
where they are supposed to be when
they are expected.

Student volunteers can also
receive credit for their work. The
YMCA can arrange to give students
credit for individual or field study.

added, “We have to cast as wide a
net as possible. This has nothing to
do with ethics,” he commented.
“Professionals leave positions for
other jobs all the time.”

The I2-member committee was
formed a month ago to recommend
a list of viable candidates to replace
Dean James Kelly, who will be retir-
ing in July. The committee aims to
have a new clean for the fall of 1985.

Questions during the hearing were
raised as to what the committee was
looking for in a new dean. »

“I have devised a list of 28 differ-
ent characteristics for the potential

dean,” stated Bond, “and he or she W

Discussion then focused on
whether the next dean should be a
scholarly intellectual or a person
with “hands on” experience.

“It is not an either/ or situation,”
explained DeFigio. “We need a dean
who can recognize the complexity of
the university, someone with a

proven track record, a person who,

can deal with the problems of higher
education.”

Zigmond agreed: “We want some-
one who is happy in his currentjob,
a person with leadership ability and
a vision for the future." _

Only about five to I0 students work
for credit each term; the others are
volunteers who continued to work
after they became ineligible to
receive credit. According to Wells,
the volunteers express a feeling that
the experience of working with these
young people is something very
special.

At the Mclntyre Shelter, the
volunteers usually work from 5 p.m.
until about 9 p.m., conducting
recreational activities for the child-
ren such as basketball and arts and
crafts, as well as dances and holiday
parties for older children.

The volunteers gain as much from
the experience as the children they
are helping, according to Amy Hart,
another director at the Pitt YMCA.
‘‘I’m living proof ofwhat the YMCA
can do for a person,” she com-
mented. I find I have_a realjump on
others in any field in practical expe-
rience. I wouldn’t be where I am
today if it weren’t for YMCA
volunteering.”

Dean

were broadened when John Flint,
from the University Center for Inter-
national Studies, proposed that
“any would-be dean should think in
international terms.” He recom-
mended that the next education
dean emphasize Pitt’s role in the glo-
bal scheme by preparing teachers for
the international environment.

The committee agreed that the
next dean should possess “interna-
tional understanding and a feel for
education.”

In the next few months, the com-
mittee will conduct interviews and
begin selecting from among the
applicants.

Flowers perfect Valentine’s gift

(UPI) — “All ﬂowers say the same
thing, no matter what kind.”

That’s the message from the
owner of a ﬂower shop in the
nation's capital.

But on Valentine’s Day, roses
seem to be the traditional favorite.
The cost of a dozen roses seems to go
up every year, largely because they
are in such demand. And on Valen-
tine’s Day, ﬂower retailers do have
their annual tradition. It’s called
“jacking up the prices.”

But the shop owners say they're
not to blame. Just ask Sandra
Turner, an employee at a Miami
ﬂower shop where a dozen red roses
sell for $45.

Turner said ﬂower shops are “at
the mercy” of wholesalers who, as
she put it, “always raise their prices
tremendously for Valentine's’ Day
and Mother’s Day.” In fact, said
Turner, wholesale prices tripl_e on
those occasions.

Glenn Harper, owner of a ﬂower
shop in Atlanta, said he charges $60
for a dozen red roses —- but that’s

Benjamin added that he was
unaware that other areas have
received the updates and timetables,
which he felt are very important.
“We are now trying to sort out what,
in fact, happened, and take correc-
tive action,” he said.

Benjamin also stated that the
search for a new Dean of the School
of Education was “off and running.”
The search committee was charged
by Posvar on January 21. Several
hearings have already taken place.

In other business, Executive Vice
President Jack Freeman discussed
the continuing efforts of Pitt to
obtain the Harmarville Research
Center as a charitable donation
from Chevron Corporation.

only for now. On Valentine's Day,
his price may escalate to about $67 a
dozen.

Prices are more moderate in the
Midwest. At O‘Connells Florists in
Columbus, Ohio, store clerk Marily
Smith said prices range from about
$36 to $48 a dozen.

If money is no object for you, the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel Flower
Shop in Manhattan is selling a
dozen roses for as much as $100,
depending on the stem length.

If the price of roses makes you see
red, there are alternatives.

Some ﬂorists suggest tulips as a
substitute. They cost much less than
roses and, after all, it’s the thought
that counts.

Valentine’s Day is taking on
added significance this year, because
of what many see as a resurgence of
romance. And as far as symbols go,
none is more important on this spe-
cial day than the Valentine’s Day
card.

It’s a scene reported in schools
across the country on Valentine’s
Day: boys and girls handing out
colorful symbols of devotion and
love to everyone in their class and
maybe hoping that one “right per-
son” will take the message seriously.

In fact, officials at American
Greeting Cards Corporation said
that children send valentines more
than any other group.

It's not just schoolchildren. Older
boys and girls also send valentines,
often with the same hopes.

People who send Valentine cards
may not realize they‘ve got quite a
history behind them. It’s taken more
than l,700 years for valentines to
develop into what they are today.

Valentines originally were strictly
messages of friendship. They had no
romantic significance. Historians
believe that the first valentine card
was sent in the year 270 A.D. by St.
Valentine himself, on the eve of his
execution for refusing to renounce
Christianity.

Signed, “from your Valentine,” it
was a note of appreciation from the
doomed young priest to the jailer’s
blind daughter. She had been kind
to him, bringing food and delivering
messages.

It was not until the Middle Ages
that the love element was intro-
duced. Valentines were hidden by
love-struck young men in hollow
trees to elude vigilant fathers.

The oldest known existing valen-
tine is in the British Museum in Lon-
don. It was penned in 1415 by the
Duke of Orleans to his lady love
after he was taken prisoner in the
battle of Agincourt.

From those early days, valentines
have become big business in the Uni-
ted States.

Every year, more than 500 million
valentine cards are sent and received
in this country. And they all ask that
sweet old question: “Will you be my
valentine?”

Here’s hoping that every answer
this Valentine’s Day will be “Yes.”

Favorable results come from
Freshman Council survey

By Johnene Lonski
The Pitt News

A discussion about Playfair, a
proposed orientation event aimed at
helping freshmen “break the ice,”
dominated last night's meeting of
the Freshman Council. Some coun-
cil members are attempting to find
ways to prove the usefulness of this
new approach to freshman
orientation. _

To better evaluate Playfair, coun-
cil member Debbi Edwards wrote
letters to several colleges and univer-

sities that have already implemented
the program. The result: All of the
campuses contacted spoke highly of
the project.

In other business, the council’s
concern over commuter apathy has
led them to devise a commuter sur-
vey. They plan to distribute 200
copies of this survey to commuter
students, in hopes of finding ways of
getting commuters more involved at
Pitt.

The cancellation of the council’s
proposed ice-skating project proved
to be a disappointment to those
present. The Allocations Committee
refused funding the project. After

listing several reasons why the funds
were refused, SGB representative
Greg Cederlof assured the council
that their reasons were reasonable.
“They had good reasons, they did
theirjob, and that’s all there is to it.”

The recent problems of the Pirates
baseball team, resulting from their
low ticket sales, has the council hop-
ing to secure tickets at half-price for
Pitt students.

Finally, President Jim Garboden
invited freshmen with new ideas to
become involved with the program.
“I‘d like to keep the enthusiasm
going to further years in the Fresh-
man Council," he said.

Writers’ Conference showcases local talent

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

Pulitzer Prize-winning essayist
Annie Dillard and PBS “Smithson-
ian" host David McCullough, both
natives of Pittsburgh, will appear as
featured speakers Saturday evening,
March 30, at the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Ninth Annual Writers’ Con-
ference. Sponsored by the
university’s writing program in the
Department of English, the confer-
ence brings together past and pres-
ent Pennsylvania writers in a series
of lectures, readings and workshops
that coincide with the 1985 year-
long celebration of the Year of the
Pennsylvania Writer.

“This will be the largest and most
important conference we have ever
staged,” said conference director
Lee Gutkind. “Not only are we feat-
uring writers of international

acclaim, they have important local 9

connections as well. Many were
raised in Pittsburgh  Gerald Stern

and Jack Gilbert were boyhood
friends; Dillard and John Wideman
lived just blocks apart but in com-
pletely different worlds."

In 1975 Dillard, who was born
and raised in Point Breeze and
attended the Ellis School in Pitts-
burgh, won the Pulitzer Prize for
General Non-fiction for her novel
“Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,” and the
New York Presswomen’s Award for
Excellence for her essay “Innocence
in the Galapagos." McCullough is
best known for his two books, “The
Johnstown Flood” and “Mornings
on Horseback." His 1977 book on
the history of the Panama Canal,
“The Path Between the Seas,” won
the National Book Award for his-
tory, the Parkman Prize and the
Cornelius Ryan and Samuel Eliot
Morison Awards.

Screenwriter Julius J. Epstein and
novelist John Wideman are among
the other guests. Epstein, the writer
of the Oscar-winning film “Casa-
blanca,” graduated from Penn State
University (which he chose to attend
because of its boxing program) and
went on to a 50-year screenwriting

Pitt women host Big East rival tonight 

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Pitt women’s basketball coach
Judy Saurer hopes her squad will
react the same way they did last time
at South Orange, N.J., when they
face Seton Hall tonight at 5:30 at the
field house in a preliminary contest
to the men’s game with Connecticut.

When the Panthers played Seton
Hall on Jan. 12, Pitt ame away with
an 18-point victory and snapped a
two-game losing streak. More
importantly, the Lady Panthers
seemed to have finally gotten it
together against Seton Hall. Follow-
ing the squad’s 96-84 victory over
Duquesne last Saturday, Saurer
commented on the upcoming game:
“The Seton Hall game really got us
going. But they're going to come in
here ready to play."

Yes, indeed, just ask Syracuse.
The Orange were cruising along last
week after upset wins over Villanova
and Pitt, but then came I-9 Seton
Hall to upset the Orange.

The Bucettes, under Coach Sue
Dilley, were able to stay with the
Panthers throughout the first half in

“It was the first time I had
started in a while when I
hit my first shot, it felt
good.”

— Senior Guard Stephanie
Collins, who hit 8 of9 field
goals

their first meeting this year, but the
Panthers, behind Jennifer Bruce’s 25
points, pulled away in the second
half for a 76-58 victory.

If Pitt is to continue its winning
ways, it will need the same team
effort it showed against Duquesne.
The Lady Panthers had five players
score in double figures. Senior Ste-
phanie Collins put on a shooting
performance, making 8 of 9 shots
from the_._.field, most of which hit
nothing but the bottom of the net.

Collins, who will probably start
tonight following her solid perfor-
mance against Duquesne, com-
mented on the game Sunday night:
“It was the first time I had started in

Joey avid tries to dribble arouiid dender. 

 

a while  when I hit my first shot, it
felt good.”

Pitt will also need solid play from
junior point guard Kim Tirik. Tirik
has played well. of late, reaching
double figures in points and assists
more than once, but she has been
plagued, just like the entire team, by
a high number of turnovers.

Pitt turned the ball over to
Duquesne 29 times -- the only thing
that kept the Duchesses in the game.

Pitt will look to use this game as a
springboard into a solid finish as it
prepares for the Big East tourna-
ment, which takes place Feb. 28 to
March 2 at Manley Field House in
Syracuse, N.Y.

Notes: St. John’s dismissed guard
Faye Gerald from the team. In the
Pitt-St. John’s game on Jan. 19,
Gerald scored 20 points and had six
assists and a steal as St. John’s pre-
vailed 73-67. Her absence will give
the Panthers an added boost in the
upcoming Big East tournament.

McCloud big fish in SH pond

By Jim (Irban
The Pitt News

Seton Hall has a record of0-ll in
the Big East, and 9-I3 overall. For
Coach P.J. Carlesimo, it has been a
long season. Carlesimo has seen his
team blow a 12-point lead against
top-ranked St. John’s last Monday
night, and squander many other
chances for victories in the Big East.

Looking over the Seton Hall pro-
gram from top to bottom, it bears a
strong resemblance to the Pitt pro-
gram of several years ago. Seton
Hall boasts the top scorer in the Big
East. Andre McCloud, but lacks a

supporting cast equal to the level of
McCIoud's play. Does this sound
familiar?

Two years ago, Clyde Vaughan
led the Big East in scoring with a
21.9 average as the Panthers finished
their first year in the Big East with a
6-10 record. Vaughan, although his
performance deserved the recogni-
tion, was not even named first-team
all-Big East. McCloud finds himself
in the same predicament. “It is frus-
trating," said McCloud after the
Pirates’ 80-68 loss to Pitt on Satur-
day. “But it’s just something you
gotta overlook."

McCloud is not being overlooked
by everyone, however. Pitt coach

~Roy Chipman praised McCloud

after the game on Saturday. “He
reminds me of Clyde Vaughan," said

“I ’m looking forward to
next year. Next year,
everything could turn
around.”

 though, Davide wants to practice

medicine.

David is a pre-med/ neuroscience
major and plans to attend medical
school. “I am going to apply to med-
ical school this spring,” he said.
“Right now, it is a matter of getting
in there and being accepted. I don’t
know what I want to specialize in.
I’m not the type to sit at a desk,
though. I want to be occupied. I
want something that is interesting
and a challenge.”

David has a good track record
that should be quite an asset when

acceptance time comes. Since com- -

ing to Pitt, he has earned a QPAV of
3.0 or better and has also been a
member of the athletics director's
honor roll every term. In addition,
he was recently nominated as Big
East Male Basketball Scholar Ath-
lete of the Year.

“Joey typiﬁes what we think of as
the student athlete,” commented
Pitt assistant coach Joe DeGregor-
io. “He really takes his studies
seriously. With his intentions to go
to medical school, he knows that he
has to get good grades. He always
takes books with him on the road.“

Being on the Panther basketball
team means a lot of travelling, but
David finds time to study. “I take my
books with me whenever we go on
the road," David said. “It's hard,
though, because between watching
films and having shooting practice
there’s not much free time. I do try to
get in at least an hour, though. I have
friends in my classes and whenever I

miss class they help me and give me

the notes that I missed.”

Even when the team is not on the
road, David has a busy schedule.

A typical day includes attending
morning and afternoon classes,
going to the field house at 3 p.m. for
warmups, practicing from 4 until 6
p.m., eating dinner and then return-
ing to his dorm room at about 7:30.

“It’s all a matter of having a time
schedule down,” David explained.
“If I don’t study after practice, then I
won’t get it done until the next night.
It’s not that bad, though, because I
know I have to study and Ido on my
free time. Sometimes, though, I
think it would be so easy to be just a
student."

The person who probably knows
what David is going through more
than anybody is his father, Sam
David. He played for the Panther
basketball team from 1946-49 and is
now an Orthodox priest at St.
George Orthodox Church near
Schenley Park in Oakland.

“I was in pre-med at Pitt on a
basketball scholarship, too,” the
elder David explained. “I under-
stand how difficult it is.

“I tell Joey to realize his full
potential and to study and play as
hard as he can. Not many basketball
players make it in pro ball, so the
most important thing is to get a good
education. Joey is well motivated,
though. He knows the demands of
college athletics, especially with
grades."

During the spring term for the
past two years, David attended
classes that have really benefitted

him. “It is much easier in the spring,” -

Memories of medals
shine five years later

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

It seems hard to believe, but it’s
been ﬁve years since the 1980 Winter
Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. In
fact, it was five years ago this week
that the games got under way. I
don’t remember much about the
games now, just things like Eric
Heiden in his gold speed-skating
suit, so fitting for the man with a
Midas touch; and Tai Babalonia and
Randy Gardner, missing their shot
at the Gold Medal because of an
injury to Gardner.

But one thing stands out from
those games, shining like a diamond
in a field of rubies: the Olympic
hockey team and their achievements

-will live in my memory, forever

vivid.

If the team’s gold-medal perform-
ance didn’t touch you, if it didn’t
mean anything to you, then this arti-
cle will seem pointless, just some
sentimental slobbering over an event
long passed. If, however, during the
final seven minutes of the game with

Russia, you were sitting inches from b

your TV, your heart pounding faster
when the Russians buzzed around
the American net Jim Craig so bril-
liantly defended, and hanging on
every word ABC commentator Al
Michaels uttered, then this article is
intended for you.

At that time it meant more for
America. There were hostages in
Iran, the Russian army was in Af-
ghanistan and the inflation rate was
around 15 percent. We weren’t in a
depression, just depressed. We
needed something to lift our spirits,
and the American boys on blades fit
the bill. It was a time when heroes

Midweek
Commentary

were few. There were, of course, the
Pittsburgh Pirates, the “We Are
Family” pennant winners of the fall
of ’79, but that was only for Pitts-
burgh. The rest of the country still
needed to find its own family, and on
the ice in Lake Placid, it did.

One reason we liked that team so
much is that they reminded us of
ourselves. We saw them the way we
saw ourselves - the underdog,
down and out maybe, but never
beaten. That team embodied some-
thing we remembered but seemed to
have lost; the indomitable American
ideal of never giving up.

It was a patriotic type of thing,
like picnics on the Fourth of July -
“fun wrapped in red, white and
blue.”

So just cast your mind back and
think about where you were when
you watched the games, who you
were with. Maybe these memories
will jar some of yours:

0 The first night of competition
and defenseman Bill Baker ties the
Sweden game with six seconds left in
the final period.

0 Then a stunning 7-2 win over
powerful Czechoslovakia.

0 The wins piling up as the games
progress. America leading the Blue
Division and an uncomfortably
close game with Norway on Satur-
day afternoon.

0 Team U.S.A. in the medal
round. A game with the Soviet
Union looming on Friday evening.

0 ABC does not carry the game
live but opts for tape delay, giving
more Americans the time to get
home from work and watch.

0 The Russians score first, but the
Americans aren’t getting blown out.

0 Tension builds in the second
period. Jim Craig makes save after
save. Mark Johnson scores a goal to
tie the game at three with one second
left in the second period.

0 Midway through the third.
period, Americans steal the puck in
their own end, pass to Eruzione at
center ice; he moves around a lone
Russian defender and rifles a wrist

shot ‘past Russian goaltender Vla-V

dimir Myshkin.

0 In the final seconds, Al
Michaels, unable to hold his motion
back any longer, yells into the mic-
rophone, “Do you believe in mira-
cles?  Yes!"

‘The crowd chants, “U.S.A.! 
U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!”

0 The anticlimactic game with
Finland on Sunday. As the clock
winds down on one of the greatest
sports stories of this century, Al
Michaels counts down the seconds:
“Four to the gold  three to the gold

. two  one  The impossible
dream has come true!” And in the
process all our dreams seemed a lit-
tle closer to coming true.

0 After the Finland game, Jim
Craig, unshaven with a flag draped
around his shoulders, searches the
crowd for his father.

Happy anniversary, guys.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, Februarv 13, 1985

Cohesiveness propels Panthers toward tournament

ByMarkA.8Indler
ThePIttNews

The ﬂuidity so evident in the
Panthers’ fourth straight win Satur-
day could be attributed to a variety

, of reasons.

Seton Hall was winless.

Pitt had already extracted 60 per-
cent of its schedule's contents.

The basketball game did not
attract a sellout crowd.

Although the Panthers (I4-7, 5-5)
still haven't won conference games
in soldout arenas, they did play last
weekend in a fashion that bodes
fancily for their six remaining Big
East games. Beyond that, it’s tour-
nament time, a juncture at which it’s
ill-advised to embarrass yourself.

Anticipating that, Coach Roy
Chipman finally found the cohesive-
ness that must stick if the Panthers
advance beyond Madison Square
Garden. It came packaged in an 80-
68 win over the Pirates —— in a game
that saw the reserves score 30 points

and pull down 14 rebounds.

For the first time this season, with
the regulars hindered by foul trou-
ble, reserves like Marlon Ferguson,
Matt Miklasevich, Darryl Shepherd
and Joey David emerged to keep the
point flow pouring sthoothly.

Sure, there have been earlier

sparks by David or Shepherd, but
never the concerted effort in one
afternoon.

“We felt good, things were click-
ing for us,“ Shepherd said. “Now we
feel that when the big guys get in
trouble, well, before there was ques-
tion whether the reserve players
could do it.”

Shepherd is now tops among
reserves with a 49.4 percent shot
from the field, although David is
good for about six ppg for the l7
minutes he played.

Neither Shepherd nor David
question their jumpstart status,
although David, a junior from
Upper St. Clair, refuses to diagram a
uniform team concept.

“I can’t say whether the team has
come together, I couldn’t tell
whether it’s jelled,” David said. “We
still have big games coming up and I
would look foolish if we started los-
ing those. Hey, this is the season. If
we play well, there’s a tournament
for us to play in.”

Before fantasizing about the 64-
field NCAA Tournament or the
NIT, the Panthers begin their last leg
of ’85 at 8 p.m. tonight against Con-
necticut. After that, there are con-
secutive visits to the foxholes of St.
John’s (Friday) and Georgetown
(Tuesday).

A five-game winning streak that
looks so inviting after tomorrow can

further deteriorate on the road
against Syracuse or at home against
Boston College and Villanova.

“I don’t think we’ve reached our
peak,” David said. I

Vkmpomt

“We're playing pretty good
together,” forward Chip Watkins
said.‘“In the beginning it looked
pretty bleak. We started winning
when everyone got their heads
together."

Though not a Wayman Tisdale,
Watkins has persevered over fellow
senior Andre Williams at power for-
ward, lookingto compensate for lost
opportunities at the tail-end of his
college career.

In 14 of2l games started, Watkins
passed off numbers that «would list
him a reserve were it not for the
absurdity of a 6-7, 205-lb. veteran
sitting on the bench. His 47.1 per-
cent field shooting has gotten him
6.4 ppg when not grabbing five
boards a game.

“This is my last year, but I still
take it day by day," Watkins said.
“I’m happy to be at Pittsburgh, but
it’s been ups and downs. If I didn’t
capitalize on the time I was given, it’s
my own fault. There are things you
expect out of yourself and I’m still

trying to reach for them."

During Pitt’s current winning
streak, Watkins has averaged more
than seven rebounds and his 80 per-
cent free throw efficiency (28-35)
ranks among the conference’s Top
10.

Shooting about 40 percent his
freshman year, sophomore Marlon
Ferguson has had as unstable an
initiation as Watkins did three years
ago.

Though still too lanky at 6-8, 190
lb., he might find his niche quicker
than Watkins ever had. His 18 min-
utes of playing time on Saturday
proved to be his strongest Pitt game
ever. More importantly, Chipman
finds in Ferguson a forward becom-
ing nearly as reliable as Shepherd.

It’s getting to be symptomatic,

this greater reliability.
“We’ve jelled, but I don’t know how
strong [the team] is,” Ferguson said.
‘We’re hungry for our victories;
we’d like to go to the NCAAs. We
see that. Tha*’° what it is.”

Off the Boards: The last time the
Panthers faced UConn, Jan. 5, Pitt
blew a 12-point first half lead before
losing 76-74. I

Earl Kelly, who scored 18 points
despite fouling out with 10 minutes
remaining in that game, leads the
Huskies with 16.9 ppg. Their front-

court of seniors Ray Broxton (13.6)
and Alvin Frederick (ll.6) sealed
the victory.

About 500 tickets remain for
tonight’s game.

David, earlier caught in a hor-
rendous shooting slump that saw
him hit only 32 percent, is up to 39.4,
contending that one of the Panthers’
improvement areas does not include
his second guard position.

“I don't think that's a problem,”
he said, mindful of starter Deme-
treus Gore’s 43 percent. “I’ve been
shooting well [62 percent the last
two games]. Rebounding —— that’s
where we can do better.”

For the record, the only honest
leaders are forward Charles Smith
(7.8) and center Keith Armstrong
(5.8).

UConn is currently in seventh
place at 4-7 (1 1-9 overall).

continued from page thirteen
David admitted. “It’s a chance to get
better grades.”

Although David grew up around
basketball, his real interest in the
sport came from watching Larry
Bird when he played at Indiana
State.

“I fell in love with basketball after
watching him," he said. “I saw him
play a lot in college and he sets a nice
example."

Despite his success in the class-
room, David has not had it as easy
on the basketball court this year. A
dislocated ﬁnger on his right hand
requires surgery in March. He has
had to play with his fingers taped
together for the majority of the
season.

David admitted that having his
family, relatives and old friends at
the games really helps. “I like having
my dad around, especially during
the rough times,” David stated.
“When something happens, good or
bad, it is nice to have him there.”

David almost chose not to play in
front of the home crowd.

“I had made.a verbal commitment
to Ohio State,” he explained. “But
the coach went back on some of the
things he said. I then decided to
come to Pitt. I wanted to play in the
Big East. My dad also had an effect
on it. He is all blue and gold.”

ADOPTION: We are a young,
responsible and happily mar-
ried couple who want to share
their love with a newborn. Our
family can give a child a beauti-
ful home and a chance to have
the best things in life. We can
help make this difficult time
easier for you. Please give your-

situation Clyde was."

McCloud came to Seton Hall
from Woodson High School in
Washington, D.C. Only a junior,
McCloud has already reached the
l,000-point plateau, and is currently
ranked in the Top 10 of three Big
East statistical categories. McCloud
leads the league in scoring, averag-
ing over 19 ppg, is seventh in
rebounding (7. I) and is fourth in free
throw percentage (78 percent).
Carlesimo ‘noted, “He continues to
improve each season. Andre is an
excellent scorer and rebounder who
has worked very hard on his defense
and ball handling.”

McCloud is a strong(6-6, 210 lbs.)
forward who has started every game
but one since coming to Seton Hall.
McCloud passed up such schools as
Syracuse, Ohio State and Maryland
in favor of Seton Hall. Since his arri-
val, Seton Hall has shown bits of
improvement, but as Vaughan illus-
trated at Pitt, it takes more than one
player to make a program.

During McCloud’s freshman
year, the Pirates were 6-23 - as

McCloud averaged 16.6 ppg. Last
year, as a sophomore, McCloud‘s
production fell to l4.8 ppg, but the
Pirates increased their record to 9-
19.

The general consensus is that
Seton Hall is maybe one recruit
away from respectability. Perhaps a
Charles Smith type would be the
hidden treasure the Pirates have
been looking for. Chipman laid it
out plain and simple: “They need a
big kid.”

In the meantime, Seton Hall is
enjoying the presence of Carlesimo’s
finest recruiting effort. The Pirates
started three freshmen against Pitt:
forward Martin Salley, center Mark
Bryant and guard James Major. Of
the 11 Pirates that saw action on
Saturday, only two are seniors, and
only one, guard Ransom Eaves,
started.

That alone makes McCloud itch
for next season. “I'm looking for-
ward to next year,” said McCloud.
“Next year, everything could turn
around.”

Chipman agrees, “They have to
feel optimistic.”

Doctor Takes
Break

(UPI) — Philadelphia 76ers
forward Julius Erving will not
compete in the NBA Slam-dunk
competition on Saturday in Indi-
anapolis. Erving had earlier
refused to participate in such
events. One reason for his
absence at Indianapolis is the
pressure he received beforehand.
Erving said: “I got drafted.
That’s like in the Army. To be
drafted takes something away
from it, I would think."

Guinness shot

(UPI) ~— It was still a sensa-
tional basketball shot, but it’s
not as long as was first thought.
The length-of-the-court shot by
Bruce Morris of Marshall at the
halftime buzzer against Appala-
chian State last Thursday night
has been re-measured. Now it’s
89 feet 10 inches.

PRESENTS...

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February l3, 1985

Sports Briefs  

The shot will be submitted to
the Guinness Book of World
Records. At first, it was thought
to be approximately 92 feet. If
accepted, the senior guard’s shot
would break the record of 89

feet, three inches by Les Hinson,

of Virginia Tech. Hinson’s last-
second shot beat Florida State
19;77 in January of 1980.

Lendl upset

(UPI) — Sweden's Stefan
Edberg upset top-seed Ivan
Lendl yesterday by the score of
6-4, 7-6 to reach the quarter-
finals of the International Play-
ers Championship at Delray
Beach, Florida. Because of rain,
Monday’s match was interrupted
with Edberg leading 6-4, 5-6.

In other tournament action,
France’s Yannick Noah
advanced to the semi-finals with
a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Sammy
Giammalva. 15-year-old "West
German Steffi Graf needed only

47 minutes to upset 13th-seeded Q

Hungarian Andrea Temesvari,
6-2, 6-1, to reach the women's
semi-ﬁnals.

Goodbye Girls

(UPI) — The NFL New Eng-
land Patriots have disbanded
their cheerleading squad after
being slapped with two $1 mil-
lion lawsuits for injuries. Club
General Manager Pat Sullivan
told the squad last Friday about
the decision.

Illegal
Recruiting?

(UPI) — The NCAA is investi-
gating Duquesne University for
the alleged illegal recruitment of
6-10 center Tom Harvey. They
have ruled that because he
attended Cal-Poly—San Luis
Obispo and spent a semester at
Victor Valley Junior College in
California, he will be ineligible to
compete this season. He
attended both schools before
coming to Duquesne, thereby
violating the NCAA’s “four-to-
four rule,” which will cost him
one year of eligibility.
