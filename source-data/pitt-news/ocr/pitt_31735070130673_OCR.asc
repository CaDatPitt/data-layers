The permit" also names “four south panels” in the
building as areas to be abated, and says that it must be
“posted in a conspicuous location and  framed or oth-

The permit is also gluedronto the plastic sheet.

On one of the floors, the bottom of the plastic sheet
had been ripped open. . 0

“It’s precautionary,” Pitt spokesman Ken Service

News Editor

Matt Lieberman is used to speaking
in front of groups. He is even used to

speaking in front of students.

The son of democratic vice presi-
dential hopeful Joe Lieberman, the
younger Lieberman is used to speaking
to his eighth, 11th and 12th grade
English students. 0

He is canvassing the nation, work-
ing for his father and Vice President Al
Gore’s campaign. He said he spends

about half of his time with his father

and the other half on his ‘own.
“I just want people to know that

' Dad and Al Gore are both really good

guys,” he said.

Lieberman has been on the cam-
paign trail since August, when his
father was named the democratic vice
presidential candidate.

“I help him out however I can,” he
said.

As part of this strategy, Lieberman
visited Pitt last night to address the
University Democrats and to join some
of them at Mitchell’s Restaurant and
Bar to watch the presidential debate
between his father’s rumiing mate and

‘Texas Gov. George W. Bush.

“Al Gore will do great,” Lieberman
said. “He understands the issues from a
policy perspective and a human per-
spective, [making him] a good public
servant.”

“[We’ll] enjoy Al Gore’s command
of the issues,” he said, predicting a stel-
lar Gore performance during the debate.
He also alluded to the vice president’s

admitted factual errors he made during

the last debate.
“Gore’s in the public light. A lot of
people were turned off by  some sort

of ‘mysterious debate’ Al Gore that
popped up,” Lieberman said.

Lieberman said the scrutiny that
Gore has been under has not affected
him or his father.

Since he has been campaigning
since August, the younger Lieberman
has yet to meet any of his classes at The
Hopkins School, where he teaches in
New Haven, Conn. He plans on meet-
ing them for_ the first time on the
Monday after the election on Nov. 7.

“I like teaching,” he said. “It’s a
grind  [but] it’s a wonderful grin .”

Aside from being there to “fire up
the troops,” Lieberman was also thank-
ing the troops +- the core of University
Democrats from both Pitt and West
Virginia University who have been
working on the democratic campaign
this fall. .

Lieberman also encouraged other
University students to vote. '

“This is our future,” he said. “It’s
the future of college students more than
anyone else.”

He said that college students are the
ones who are going to feel the brunt of
the impact "of legislative decisions
being made now. '

“The world’s going to start being
theirs,” he said.

He said that Gore and his father are
proposing $10,000 tax deductions for
college tuition expenses, as well as

increased grants and federal1y—ftmded '

scholarship programs. He said they plan
to expand the work—study program.

By maintaining a balanced budget,
as the democratic ticket is proposing,
Lieberman said interest rates on things
such as student loans, credit card bills
and car payments will stay low.

“Whether you’re a Democrat or a

Republican, it’s important that you try

to get involved,” he said.
