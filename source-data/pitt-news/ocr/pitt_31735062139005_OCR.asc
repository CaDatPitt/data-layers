Academic Procession in the r

Morning—'Many Degrees

HONOR AIVIBASSADORS

 

The Anniversary or Charter Day
exercises were held last Wednesday
inthe Soldiers’ Memorial Hall. The
celebration was dist-inguished by the
presence of numerous learned and
notable men, and by the conferring of
honorary degrees. It was a typical
winter day, being cold and windy, bur
in spite of this fact the scheduled
academic procession was formed near
State Hall. It was estimated that
nearly one thousand persons were in
line, marching to Memorial Hall by
way of—Parkman boulevard and Fifth
avenue. The parade was headed by
the student band, followed by students
in cap and gown acting as an escort.
Other divisions were representatives

of American institutions, representa-

tives of foreign institutions, delegates
from secondary schools, trustees, fac-
ulty andlast the speakers and lion-
orary degree men, lead by Dean I. C.
Fetterman. In the number of distin-
guished mezi marching this procession
has probably "never been equaled.
Large crowds lined the route of the
parade. The men marched in: double
ﬁle and the students separated at the
entrance of the hall forming a line-
on either side of the steps through

‘which the remainder of the procession

marched.

‘ After all had been seated the exer-
cises were opened by an invocation
by the Rev. M. B..Riddle. Mayor W.
A. Magee then made an address of

welcome. He said in part: .
“Never beforeein the history of
Pittsburgh has there been exactly

such an occasion and never before has
our city been graced by an assemblage

Pittsburgh Papers i 
s Help University

During the week of the anniversary
celebration, almost fifty columns of
space were devoted by the Pittsburgh
newspapers to the events taking place
at the University. In many cases the
leaders were anniversary events. An
unusual amount of space was given
by the papers to the convocation
Wednesday morning and to the
alumni banquet Wednesday evening.
The papers gerformed a prominent
part in making the celebration a suc-
cess through the publicity which they
gave the various activities of the an-
niversary week. Without such efﬁ-
cient and able aid it would have been
impossible to secure so large audi-
ences as were present.

Dr..Linhart, Secretary of the Uni-
versity, expressed himself as ‘very
well pleased with the cordial support
offered the ,University by the Pitts-
burgh newspapers. He stated that to
them a large part of the success was
due aiidvthat their co-operation was
heartily appreciated by the authorities
and friends of the University.

Many Famous Men‘

Address Students

Speeches Made on Afternoon of Char-
ter Day by Men From East
and West.

 

Several speeches by men represent-
ing all the different parts of the
United States featured -the afternoon
program of Charter Day. Dr. W. J.
Holland gave history of the Universi-
ty from the time of its incorporation
as an institution of learning to the
present day; Dr. E. F. Smith of the.
University of Pennsylvania, represent-
ing the East, gave a short address:
Dr. J. D. Moffat, president of Wasli—
ington and Jefferson College, spoke

on behalf of Western Pennsylvania’

Dr. J. H. Finley, president of the
C-ollege_of the City of New York, rep-
resenting the East, gave a brief
speech; Dr. W. 0. Thompson, presi-
dent of Ohio‘ State University, spoke
for the West._ _

Dr. Holland gave a very complete
history of the University, consider-
ing the fact that he was only per-
mitted to speak for forty minutes. He
praised the present Chancellor for his
untiring efforts to promote the inter-
ests of the University, since his ap-
pointment to the office of Chancellor
He urged every student and friend of
the University to give the Chancellor
their most hearty co-operation in the

Musical Entertaininent

L Is Well Attended

The anniversary celebration came
to a close on Thursday evening with
a ﬁne concert given by the combined
musical and dramatic clubs of the
University. The program was divided
into two parts; the ﬁrst part devoted
to the‘Glee and Mandolin Clubs and
the Student Band, and the second part
turned over to the “stunts” of the Cap
and Gown Club. The affair was well

 

attended and every one went away '

well pleased with the evening's en-
tertainment.

The Student Band made its initial‘

appearance upon the concert plat-

'form and rendered several selections

in _a manner, which reflected credit
upon the organization and the school.
Vocal solos were rendered by A. R.
Cancelliere, Richard R. ]»ohnston,._l.

_ B. O’Donnell and Gustav -A. Laub.

Lach of these men displayed rare tal-
ent and individuality in the singing of
their numbers.

I. Weinmann Cratty played a solo
upon the mandolin, which was of the
excellent quality, that is a character-
istic of his mandolin solos. ’

The dance given by the Cap and
Gown Club was a feature of the even-
ing. About a dozen fellows took _the
paints of girls and. -certainly made
charming -“ea-eds.” -

COLLEGE PRESIDENTS
HOLD CONFERENCE

iArticulation ‘of the High School and
College Is Discussed at
Conference.

Dr. Kettler of Grove City college

 _ introduced the topic, “Articulation of

the High School and the College,” at
the conference of the College Presi-
dents of Pennsylvania last Thursday
morning with an outline of the work
of the committee appointed by the De-
partment of Secondary Education last
year. One of the important thoughts

‘ in his speech‘ was that “the time has

passed when you can say to the moun-
tain,,‘come to Mohamet.”’ The High
School is an important factor and the
colleges. would -be assuniing a high

and "mighty position if they should

*tell the high schools to arrange their

~ -work to conform with that of the
1' f"col1ege.” .

Dr. Seiplein, a professor in Grove

"City College, presented ﬁve’proposi-

tions from the report of the commit-
tee appointed to ‘consider the recom-
mendation of the National Educa-
tional Association, adopted at San

' - Francisco. ~

George Leslie Omwake, Vice Presi-
dent of Ursinus College, in consider-
ing the report from the point of view
‘of a complete High School course,
said in part:

“Let us broaden the idea of educa-

a -tion and have the high schools do for

the mechanical arts what the universi-
ty has done "for the sciences underly-
Education was always‘
viewed as essentially a broadening ex-
ercise. The most liberalizing study is
-that which the student least of all

.. needs for a speciﬁc function in the

world. Training is anarrowing proc-

ess. The intention of training is con-
centration. e aim 1S_ to bring an
ind1v1dual’s power to do one thing

-right and shut out other things. If

' we.can enrich education by training

we are ready for it, but we do not
want it to supplant education.

,.
«I

view of the increasing complexity of .

our edu-cation some laxity might be
granted to the high schools.”
In considering the merits of the re-

.~ A port of the committee as a basis for
‘ qadmission to college, Isaac Sharpless

President Haverford College, said:_'
“It is a revolutionary report, but I
like to live in revolutionary times and
The high
school should represent the demands

0 A of the public and the colleges should

co-operate with them. The high
. school age is the age when foreign
" languages should be taught and

studied. The need of foreign lan-

_guages _-in all departments as a basis

of scientiﬁc work is so great that col-
leges will have to demand a reason-
able amount of foreign languages if
it wishes to go on.

(‘High school principals say that
they should teach what they please
and -the colleges should accept it. But
the colleges must uphold the standard
_of education and must not be lax. The
colleges would rather take a high
school student without any science

« The right way for a college man to

study is to begin with the foreign lan-

. guages and then goon with the sci-

ences. I would vote for the ﬁrst four

' ’ but not the ﬁfth.”
In discussing the question, W. H.-

Crawford. President Allegheny Col-
lege. said:

‘ “Do _not mix high school and col-
lege work. When he gets into col-
lege, a student shouldbe made to
understand that he has grown to in-
tellectual manhood. When he enters
c-ollege, we are looking to him as the
man he will be four years later not

 what he has been in high school."

Ethelbert Dudley Warﬁeld, Presi-
dent Lafayette College, who presided
at the meeting, at this point asked

a THE PITT WEEKLY

SCHOLZ VSPEAKSLTO _ ;
- T VJOURNALISTS

 

Lecture on “Newspaper Management"
Is Given by Prominent News-
-paper Man.

Emil M. Scholz, general manager
of the Post and Sun, s-poke- to the
Journalism Class Monday evening on
“Newspaper Management.”

Mr. Scholz told of the relation of
the editorial, the mechanical and the
business sides of the newspaper and
how intelligent management brought
all three into harmony with one an-
other.

“The small cities, say from 25,000
to 75,000 population,” said Mr. Scholz
“are to-day getting out as- good a
paper, both from the standpoint of
mechanical perfection and news, as
the large cities. It is accounted for
by the fact that newspaper men travel
from city to city and bring the ideas
and methods into other cities in their
new ﬁelds.”

1Mr.-Scholz concluded ‘his interest’-
ing talk by stating that the essentials’

of newspaper management, or any
kind of management, for that matter
lie in being able to make the most of
what opportunities are at hand.

Next Monday evening H. B. Lauf-
man of the Leader will speak on “The
Work and Pastime of the Newspaper-
man.”

SIES SPEAKS TO ‘COLLEGE.
CONFERENCE

Professor ‘in Education School "Dis-
cusses System of Grading.

Professor Sies of the School of Ed-
ucation read a paper on the “Scien-
tiﬁc Grading of College Students” at
the Conference of College Presideiits
last Thursday _,morning. It was a
very scientiﬁc lecture, illustrated by

a series 0 charts andidata. In part
he said: T
“College honors are everywhere

awarded on the naive assumption that
grades in college courses .are di-strib-
uted on a scientiﬁc basis. We esti-
mate the ﬁtness for candidates for ad-
mission, determine eligibility for ath-
letics, assign annually hundreds
thousands of dollars in scholarships
and fellowships, award commence-
ment honors—-elect men to Phi Beta
Kappa, and confer honorary degrees
wholly or in a large part on the evi-
dence secured by merely counting the

number of A’s, the number «of B’s and i

so forth, that each student has to his
credit.

- “Fundamental to the entire discus-
sion of the question are the scientiﬁc
principles in accordance with which
mental abilities or achievements are
actually distributed among» college
students. It is a matter of common
experience that human beings, even
those of the same sex and approxi-
mate age, vary greatly among them-
selves. The variation is far greater
in mental than in physical traits.

“We now come directly to the mat-
ter of‘the dis-tribu-tion of the ability
or achievements of college students in
college classes which constitutes one
of the complex mental traits which we
have no satisfactory means of meas-
uring at the present time.”

After an explanation of the charts
and much data, Prof. Sies said
“There is a need, as has been proven
for a scientiﬁc distribution of the
grades of college students and it is
possible from a mathematical stand-
point if the abilities and achievements
of college students are distributed" in
the form of the probability surface.
Given a faculty desirous of improve-
ment and conditions carefully con-
trolled and the principle of scientiﬁc
grading is practically feasible.”

of educators distinguished by the
number and eminence of those who
have honored us by their attendance
to-day. The anniversary comes in the-
midst of an era of wonderful activity
among us in the ﬁeld of learning. One
of the most striking activities of Pitts-
burgh during the ﬁrst years of the
twentimeth century is the advance of
higher education.

It is my province to extend the fe-
licitations of our people to this assem-
bly and in their behalf I do most cor-
dially welcome the hundreds of «.li-,-
tinguished men and women who have
gathered here to join with us in*cele-
brat-ing a century and a quarter of ex-
istence of the University of Pitts-
burgh. The good wishes of the com-
munity also go out to the large and
earnest student body and the learned
faculty composing the organization of
the institution. Congratulations are
due those public-spirited citizens who
constitute the board of trustees, and
thanks deep and sincere beyond ex-
pression~to that great man who is the
head of the institution. Formal speech
is inadequate to acknowledge the debt
of the University and the community
to the matchless constructive genius
of the chancellor. Laboring day and
night tothe limit of his powers, from
year’s end to year’s end, directing the
administration of its organization and
amassing and assembling the re-
sources necessary to its existence, he
r-epresents in his person and his life
the spirit of.the movement in our
community which is evolving, I think
the leadership of knowledge for the
future.” S

Dr. S. G. Dixon, of Harrisburg, rep-
resenting Gov. John K. Tener, fol-
lowed with an address of welcome
from the state and conveyed the greet-
ing of -the governor. He said in part:

I have the great honor of—appear-
ing before you to bring our good gov-
ernor’s greeting and to express his
deep regret that official business pre-
vented him fro-m being with you on
this your hundred and twenty-ﬁfth
birthday. i V
. ‘It is his fervent wish that you may
continue your good work throughout
this century that you are now in with
even greater success than y u have in

‘-the past, and it is his hope that the
~ very atmosphere

of the .inst-itution
will impress the students with the im-
their studies
with the idea of carrying their learn-
ing into everyday‘ life. .
“Further, I know it is his idea -that
the students should be impressed with
the truth that the battle of life is not
to be fought singlehanded. Co-opera-
tion with our fellow beings is essen-
tial for the success of all human un-
Public duties shall ‘ be

their choice of profession may be

otherwise they must fail to represent

the best influence for public good, par-
ticularly in a representative form of
government.

“This venerable institution, like all
great institutions, has had its ups and
downs, and t'heref.ore it has learned
better how to take care of itself now
that it has become one of the ﬁrst:
universities of -the United States of
America, and this, gentlemen,‘ is say-
ing a very great deal in this twentieth

ued prosperity and advancement as a
great institution of learning.

“Extending again to you the gree-t-
ing of his excellency, the governor, I
desire to express my cordial individ-
ual good wishes for your increasing
success and usefulness.”

Dr. J. H. Kirkland, Chancellor of
Vanderbilt Univers-ity, was the other
speaker of the morning. He spoke
on “Problems of H_igh'e‘r Education.”
His address in par-t was:

“‘Our institutions of high-er educa-
tion measure and gauge the intellect-
ual life of ourlpeople. They are at
once the record of our past and the
hope and prophecy of ourfuture. As
they are strong, so shall be the
strength of our nation, as they fail
so shall disaster encompassus.”

“It was not a great while after the
Revolutionary VVar until American
colleges. “developed a type different
from that of the Colonial period.
brom about 1870 to the present time
we’ have seen the extensive develop-
ment of the new American- college
and during the same periodvoccurs
the evolution of the American uni-
versity. '

p“The development of the American
college in the last »40 years has
brought many problems to the front
and has been the occasion of pro-
longed and serious discussion. The
college _journals, ofﬁcial professional
reports, educational magazines, daily
newspapers and all forms of fugitive
lit-erature have -taken part in the con-
ﬂict. Questions have been raised re-
garding the purpose, the plan of or-
ganization and usefulness of the col-
lege. At one time and in some quar-
ters it seemed that an attack -was to
be made on its very existence. While
these problems have not all been
solved, it may be conceded that ‘we
have reched comparatively . stable
ground. We are nearing deﬁnite re-
sults and are working our way toward
agreed conclusions on at least a few
points. '

“At one time the heat of conﬂict
raged around the classics, at another
time around the historic value and
sacredness of the A. B. degree. While
there is still much division as to de-
tails there are some broad, conclu-
sions that have been established and
are generally accepted. (a) The rigid
college course is gone and no one
wishes it res.tored. (b) New sub-
jects and new courses _have been in-
troduced by every college ‘to the ex-
tent of their ﬁnancial ability, and
even beyond. No question of theory
has restrained any of us; our limita-
tions are ﬁnancial alone, and equally
so from those in Germany. Some
years ago Dr. Von Holst delivered
an address and published an article
on ‘The Need of Universities in the
United States.’ In this article he took
occasion to deny the existence of any
university in this country. Practical-
ly the same position was taken by
Dr. Burgess, of Columbia University
in his paper published in 1885 on ‘The
American University.’ When shall it
be? Where shall it be? What shall
it ‘be? We may at once frankly admit
-that‘ the‘ German university does not
exist, because the social order out of
wfhich. that institution sprang is for-
;eig~nv.to .us..-. But there. is-no necessity
inf-hierins in....the .or.d.e,r-«Of things “W
re_q_uir_€..S all ulniversities to_be molded
aft'er _the"._Ge_r'rr1an ‘type. That "type it-

and intellectual changes. (c) The.ex-
tent to which the individual student
slfall "beallowed to his work is still
under discussion, and no agreement
seems at hand. Diversity of practice

 

self iisiiian‘ "evidl'11tio’n,- "réflecti'ng’ social"

continues and will continue. (d) The
typical courseis to occupy four years
but many students will accomplish it
in three. (e) The degree of A. B. is
already permanently changed in char-
acter. ’

“A special group of problems has
ar'sen in connection with the size and
material resources of colleges. ‘The
demands of modern life are impera-
tive. No college can m-eet'the con-
ditions of to-day with the resources
and equipment of a century ago. A
college may voluntarily choose a path
of renunciation, may refuse to intro-.
duce somenew subjects or to go to
extremes in subdividing old ones, but
no college can escape the ﬁnancial
burden involved in providing certain
essential laboratories, scientiﬁc equip-
ment, and a well ﬁlled library care-
fully administered._

“The American

University has

within the present generation rapidly.

assumed a deﬁnite form and type.
This type differs essentially-from that
of the historic English universities.”

At the conclusion of Chancellor

'Kirkland’s address the honorary de-

grees were conferred by Chancellor
S. B. McCormick. There were twen-
ty—eight in all who received degrees
Dr. W. J. Holland presented Count
von Bernstorff, ambassador extraor-
dinary and plenipotentiary from the
German Empire, as the ﬁrst of the
notables to be honored by the Uni-
versity. After having conferred upon
him the degree of doctor of laws by
Chancellor McCormick, Count von
Bernstorff responded, «saying:

“It is always” a great pleasure for

me to return to Pittsburgh where the A

good people of this city have given
me several kind and warm receptions
in the past. I appreciate the great
‘honor which has been conferred upon
me, and 1 now consider that I am in
lasting connection with this great
University of Pittsburgh. I feel, how-
ever, that this is not given as a mark
of individual distinction." It is a trib-
ute to the friendship of the German

MISS M’KEAG SPEAKS . i .

AT CONFERENCE

 

At the joint conference of colleges
and secondary schools held last
Thursday afternoon, Miss Anna]. Mc-
Keag, President Wilson College, de-
livered an address on the subject of
high school inspection by the college.
The subject was very clearly and in-
terestingly placed before the audience;

In discussion of the topic “High
School Inspection by the College,” J.
A. Shott, Professor of Westminster
College,‘ read an exact and well-writ-
ten paper on the subject from the
view point of a college professor.
Among the things he said were the
following:

“Where the colleges inspect the
high schools, limit it to the inspection
of the work done in the colleges. We
are inspecting high schools when we
accept students on ’ certiﬁcates or
watch their work in college. The com-
mon problem to-day is that we do
not seem to know what a high school
or college course ought to be. lWe
agree upon and have lots of deﬁni-
tions, but we seem to have no aim. A
high school education is a stage of
transition. A college eduction cannot
escape the inﬂuence of the
school. The best remedy is to ‘have
every college teacher know . every-
thing about secondary school educa-
-tion. Let us get together and unjust
criticism will cease. Let us work to-
gether for

ti'o'n.”

THE ANNIVERSARY.

No one connected with the ‘anni-
versary celebration can deny that
._:.Pitt’s one hundred and twenty-ﬁfth
"birthday was 'most gloriously kept.
_From thetorclhlight parade on Monday
+evening thr-ough Wednesday’s great
convocation and banquet to the ﬁnal
renter-tainment by our musical and
gdramatic clubs, not a single mishap
-marred the festivities. "From all over
‘the land our visitors came. For such
‘anarray of noted, learned men, one
would seek far. Persons famous for
their success were honored by the
. Unriversirty with her honorary degrees.
Delegates from foreign
Jirought their ‘greetings from abroad.

E

iover thirteen "hundred present there

_. iwas held the greatest banquet which

7the University and the City of Pitts-
gburgh has ever seen. So great was
lthe success, far surpassing the “antici-
lpations of Pitt’s most ardent friends

l that the City of Pittsburgh may well _

ibe proud of a University which can
fboast of an event which will go down
iin her annals as one of the greatest
fcelebrations ‘ever ‘held in America.

ii The most hearty congratulations
{are due the many men who prepared
;for this anniversary. Chancellor Mc-
*'Cor.mick and Secretary Linhart have
worked for almost a year planning
-the many details of this‘ celebration.
Of late months these indefatigable
workers could be found almost every
night in the office until morning. And
with them were associated some of
the most able men cnnnegted with the
University, such as the general execu-
tive committee, the trustees, the
alumni banquet committee, the men
in charge of the different entertain-
ments, and many, others. To these
tireless, loyal men is due the wonder-
ful success of Pitt’s celebration. There
is no.pra,ise too great, 110 reward too
high_for these loyal sons of Pitt.

 

THE PITTSBURGH PAPERS.

To the newspapers of‘ Pittsburgh
the University owes a deep debtvof
gratitude for the attention paid by
them to the University events of the
past week. Without such cordial sup.-
port as was given by the city’s press.
the plans for the anniversary could
,not have been carried into execution
‘The attitude of the newspapers was

 a determining factor‘ in our success

Not a single paper failed to give the
University the mostprominent "posi-
tion in> its news columns. We take
the opportunity here to convey to the
newspapers of Pittsburgh, together
with the many weekly magazines who
have helped us, for the cordial sup-
port which they have given the Uni-
versity during the past week.

 

With but two weeks remaining of
the present term it behooves every
one to start .. to work immediately
after the close of the anniversary. Ex-
tra time must be devoted by the stu-
dents to their studies in order to
make up for the period lost during
the short vacation. Another side of
undergraduate activity ‘which de-
mands immediate attention is that of
the student clubs. Owing to the many
.demands of the various anniversary
activities, the undergraduates ,were
severely crippled in the work of con-
ducting their. clubs during the last
month. For the time lost much work
must be accomplished in the next few
weeks in order to prevent a fall in
the efficiency of the different clubs.
Let no time be lost in this work.

Man. ‘Box

Editor‘ Pitt Weekly:

Sir :——On behalf of the Alumni
Banquet Committee, and personally‘as
toastmaster, I want to say through

\

tive share of the undergraduates in
making, our Charter Day Banquet so
successful. T
The real “star” of that occasion
was the student body. As listeners
they were inspiring; as performers
electrifying. It is their college yells
and songs and parodies that will make
this one evening stand out for years
in the memoryi of even the most in-
veterate banquet-goer. '
i To President Ashe and the other
senators, to” Cheer Leader Kirk and

   

which could not be surpassed. With -

your columns how very greatly we'
all appreciated the exceedingly eifec-g

to every undergraduate present "we
give our heartiest thanks.

Dear Mr. George:
,Please express through the columns

of your paper the appreciation of the‘

Trustees and Faculty of the splendid

versity throughout the entire three
days of the anniversarycelebration-
at the banquet, in the play, in the
concert, and in the service at the
trains and at the University. The
wonderful success of the celebration
was due in no small’ degree to the
hearty co-operation of the students
and we are sincerely grateful to them

We can at all times rely upon our

and the visitors at our anniversary ex-
ercises will carry back to their own
colleges and universities a good re-
‘port of the enthusiasm, loyalty and
gentlemanly conduct of our student
body. The manner in which our stu-
dents conclucted themselves, and the
contribution they made to the success
of this anniversary occasion increased
our pride in them.‘ i
I am, ”

My Dear George:
In behalf of

the Committee of
rangements for the Anniversary Ban-
quet, I desire to thank the students
who assisted the Committee ‘on that
occasion. Every task assigned the
studen.t aids. no matter how burden-
some or unpleasant, was promptly
and satisfactorily attended to. With-
out their invaluable assistance it
would hav_e been impossible to c.arry
out the elaborate program of last
Wednesday evening. I

I also desire to thank the under-
graduates who participated" in ,the
Student Dinner, and afterwards in the
exercises in the Banquet Hall, for
their hearty co—operation. .

I ask that this letter or the sub-
Weekly.

By Prowler. «

Certain sundry individuals, whose
names, by some strange" oversight, ap-
pear in the catalogue of the Carnegie
Technical Schools, paid our campus
a visit last Wednesday evening. Dur-
ing their stay on the University
grounds the Tech children attempted
a very shocking trick, tampering with
the huge electric sign erected for an-
niversary vmeki , ,

The call was a phenomenal success,
‘viewed from the brains of Carn-egie.
but it lacked one, or two things to
make it complete from the Pitt stand-
point.

I sincerely regret thattime was not

the University of Pittsburgh have re—-
quested me to apologize for the ab-
‘sence of those most appropriate re.-.
ifreshments.

iacross Forbes street to see us we will
have milk, nipples, rattles, bottles and
{toys galore!

f I expect some one will have their

aname inscribed in a Carnegie pension
ﬁbook of perpetual life as a result of
‘VVednesday night’s valor. v

Poor Tech, they don’t believe in
signs! »

But,..seriously, the action of the
Technical school men was decidedly
puerile. '
our celebration was quite above the
prattle and pranks of school boys, and
it is a lasting disgrace to the intel-
lectuality (and we know it exists
some place) of Carnegie that an ef-.
fort was made “to show off.”

The happening, however, was a
boomerang, rebounding to the dis-
credit of the thrower. We are just
one hundred and twenty-ﬁveyears
ahead of such foppishness, Tech, and
perhaps you will have some sense
when the bones of last week's heroes
have lain in dust that long.

When our rivals outdistance us in.
an undergraduate activity we are men
enough to shout bravo, but a vicious
attack ongthe University of

C. W. Scovel was toastmaster. He
ﬁrst introduced Dr. B. I. Wheeler.
president of the University of Califor-
nia, who spoke on “The American
University.” He brought greetings
from the “Golden Gate” to the Iron
Village. He said in part: I -

“The American university serves the
purpose of the American people, be-
cause American men care only for
men. Good old New England gump-
tion is what we need in American
men, "ordinary horse-sense. We want
to train the young man to pass hon-
est judgment on everything. Ameri-
canism knows no favoritism, decis-
ions are given "according to the ap-
,proval of the minds of the American
people. We must ﬁrst imbue the stu-
dent with faith. -Democracy has
always been a success with us.

“In bringing the greetings from the

golden west I repeat that before long
the ‘iron village’ will be in communi-
cation with the Golden Gate _by means
of water. due to the erection ofthe
iPanama canal. Then we will be able to
handle more freely the things the
‘graduates of this institution will be
lresponsible for in the future.”
l Dr. James Ewing, of Cornell, spoke
jon “The Medical School and the Pub-
flic Welfare.” He spoke of the great
progress being made by the various
;medical schools of the United‘States.

Dr.]. G. Hilibemprcsident of Prince-
lton, spoke on“The University Man.”
j>I'I€ said the,University man is always
§on_ the lookout for thewelfare of his
lfellowmen. ‘In the past, he said, the
iyoung man could show his spirit by
enlisting in an army to preserve the
:nation, and.h.e -sa.id the young men
should enter into their college work
with-the same spirit.

. Councilman Robert Garland re-
sponded to “The City and the-Uni-
fversity.” He said in part:

“What is the connection between
our city and our university? To a
large etxent each is interdependent
upon the other. The more renowned
the city, the greater should be the uni-
versity. Having the name of our city
in your corporate title should also be
of great beneﬁt to the university, as
the name of Pittsburgh is written in
strong characters in all parts of the
civilized world. -

“These are the days. of great
achievements in applied knowledge.
There is yet a great deal to be accom-
plished in engineering, in mechanical
in chemical, and in electrical lines, and
there is as large a ﬁeld for the young
man as there ever was. You »have
your school of economics, for com-
mercial, industrial and ﬁnancial tra.in—
ing. You have your department of in-
dustrial chemistry, and one of your

“We have been ,known as the
‘Smoky City,’ and to tell you the
truth, some of us old-timers gloried in
the title. But modern ideas prevail
and we have awakened to the fact that
smoke is not only harmful in many
ways, but it means ineﬁiciency and a
willful waste. The city authorities are
engaged in the enforcement of a.
smoke ordinance,’ and it is unneces-
sary to say that we_‘will welcome any
assistance which your special corps
of engineers may render towards solv-
ing the problem -of total elimin-ation.

PITT WINS

The Westingho.use Club was the
scene of a lively battle last Friday
night when the wearers of the Gold
and.Blue defeated the Carnegie Clan
in a ‘hard-fought and close contest by
a score of 31-28._ The ﬁrst half was
all Pitt as the Tech bunch were only
able to score half as many points, but
in the second half the Plaid took a
brace and climbed within a few points
of victory. - _ '
i Frishman, Pitt’s diminutive guard
was unable to play on account of
sickness and his absence was keenly
felt, but Brady who replaced him
played a very creditable game and
will probably be used by Coach
Flint on the Eastern trip if Frishman
is still unable to play at -that time.
McDowell seemed to be -off in shoot-
ing so Graham was given a trial at
‘his forward and during his period
tossed one from the ﬂoor. Ochsen-
hirt played the best game for Pitt
getting ﬁve ﬁeld goals and also out-
jumping his larger opponent. This
man is becoming more valuable every

Pitt Will Be Well Represented-
Trials for Relay Team Held at the
Garden Last Monday -— Hope t
Win This Event. ‘

 

 

The P. A. A. meet to be ‘held at
Duquesne Garden next'Saturday night
will give Pitt supporters their ﬁrst
chance to get a line on the track
team for the coming season. The
handicap "and novice races, relay race
and ﬁeld events offer a splendid
chance for all entrants and several
Pitt men are expected to shine. Cap-
tain Bryson, the star quarter miler,
is in splendid form and if early pre-
dictions point to anything, “Pork”
will win many points for the Gold and
Blue.

The ‘Marshall boys have been
training consistently for the past sev-
eral weeks and much is expected of
them. Rosenthal and Davis who
earned their letters last year, are not
in any sort of condition at present
but several weeks of good consistent
training will probably put them in
shape. There are several other good
‘quarter milers in school this year and
the prospects for a winning relay
team is particularly bright. Octave
Opsion, .who has been training hard
for the two-mile event in the P. A.
A. meet, took a severe cold recently

The victory over Tech not only

handed the Penn team an awful wal-

to a tune of 32-11. Dope on George-

strength, so the Pi-tt tossers will have
a hard row to hoe on their extended

COLLEGE PRESIDENTS _
HoLD CONFERENCE

(Continued from Page 2)

President Apple of Franklin and
Marshall College to take the chair
and he himself made one of the most
convincing speeches of the conference.
Brieﬂy he said: '

“We must articulate the college and
the University. We must not forget
that we must consider boys and girls
and able and vigorous teachers be-
sides the colleges.. We must set, a
standard that we do not deceive the
boy into thinking that he is fit for
‘college work. We don’t want mere
college men——not the men who only
root for football and go to dance;
but those men who come to us with
earnest minds. .(App1ause.) This re-
port is not progressive by any means
We want conditions that will bring to
us men with mental stamina. VVhy
is it more vocational for g-irls to be

V able to sew than to conjugate a Latin

verb? VVhy is it more vocational for
a boy to be able to drive a nail than
be able to express himself in good
pure English? We are trying to
make real boys. .We want to give
boys a higherrealization of culture.
We will put up a‘ standard to make
boys want to come to Lafayette. And
I knowethat you all want to do that
for your colleges.”

Dr. Babcock of the Bureau of Edu-
cation at VVashington gave statistics.
gathered through his many years of
experience in inspecting colleges, that

showed that there has been “a steady A
deterioration of the standard of stu-_*

dents in the last seven or eight years.”

Rev. George of the University of

Pittsburgh spoke brieﬂy as follows:
“I remember when there was

is a high school, a mere child, stand-
ing up to the University of Pittsburgh
which is 125 years old, and saying
“I’1n as big as you.” You can’t screw‘,
minds but you must train minds. In

the same way you can’t make a high,

mem.ber that youare working for the

President Granville then spoke and
Chancellor M-cCormick closed the

‘discussion with a short ‘speech, em-

phasizing the fact that the colleges
are not dictating but setting up .a

high standard for the high schools to .

reach. After it was voted to put the
report-back in the hands of the com-

mittee for further consideration, gen,-.

eral business was attended to and the

meeting concluded with a cordial 5n*-; ;
vitation from Chancellor McCormick”

said in part: -

“Pennsylvania may justly claim the
honor of having started the first med-
ical school in the United States. She
may claim the honor of the first real
start in the development of law
schools. A goodly group of colleges
have grown up in this state that she
may well be proud of, and not only
the State «of Pennsylvania, but the
world in general may be proud of the
graduates of her colleges.

“Upon the educators of. this state
rests the duty of training the young
minds of this commonwealth in
kn-owledge not only for future use-
fulness in the world, but the educators
must train the young people t-o a high
sense of what a good character means
for after all, character is to be de-
‘ sired above all.

“I wish to congratulate the Chan..-
cellor on this great day for the work
he has done and is going to do in
the future for the city, through the
upbuilding of a great school for Pitts-

Chancellor’s speed, for I fear I can-
not keep up with him. _Ever since we
graduated together, many years ago.

I he has been pulling a little ahead of

me. At graduation we both believed
that W. & J. was the ﬁrst college
founded in this part of the State,.but
now he claims the University of
Pittsburgh was es-trabl'shecl six months

' ahead of W. & I.‘ And he is right in

that statement. ’

“There never has been any real
rivalry between W. & J. and Pitt. Of
course, during the dreary days of No-
vember we ‘have sometimes gripped
each other on the gridiron, but alto-
gether there has been a great amount
of harmony between the two institu-
tions.‘ '

 PITT WEEKLY

“It is surpri-singto know that the
University of Pittsburgh is not larger
today than it is. Why is this. Be-
cause there has be n too much indus-
try and men wheiﬁth-ey ‘have made
their money, instead of contributing
freely to build up a great school at
-home, have sent their children out or
town to school. Schools to the east
and to the west of Pittsburgh have
sprung up and prospered while Pitt
has struggled on. What Pittsburgh
men need is to recognize what the
University of Pittsburgh, can be.
Jump in and build up a gr-eat school
here, and every small college in West-
ern Pennsylvania will be greatly
beneﬁted.” _

Dr. Finley and Dr. Thompson each
brought brief greetings from their
universities to Pitt on her one hun-
dred and twenty-ﬁfth birthday.

Chancellor McCormick paid Dr.
Linhart a splendid trirbute when he
said:

“The success of this great celebra-
tion is due in large part to Dr. S. B.
Linhart, who had the details to work
out, and to carry into effect all the
various plans for this week.”
