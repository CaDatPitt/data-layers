Student Affairs Committee Feels
Fee Will Improve Activity Quality

By JACKI KATZ

The Student Affairs Committee unanimously decided at TuesdaY’s meeting that an
activities fee is the only way to keep student activities in step with the needs and inter-
ests of the student body. The suggested fee, $5 per term, would be submitted to the

Chancellor for the ﬁnal approval of the Board of Trustees.

The University is in no position to giv e the committee more money and the money
available to the committee now is limited, one member of the committee pointed out. Stu-
dents are asked to pay much for such things as Homecoming, The Owl, and Winter Week-
end because there is not money to subsidize these activities.

“I feel that the activities fee
will return more in services than
the student pays for the year,”
expressed John Vrana, Student
Government .president. “For in-
stance, by increasing the budget
of The Owl by $4,000, the price
of The Owl to the students could
drop from $10 to $4.

“If we could subsidize major
events such as Winter Weekend,

Homecoming, and Greek Week,’

the cost to the students would be
less,” Vrana continued. “Also, if
we bolstered the Student Union
budget, dances and other pro-
grams which now cost the stu-
dent, would be free.”

In another example, Vrana ex-
plained that if the WPGH, cam-
pus radio station, budget were in-
creased, the station could broad-
cast FM if they so desired and

:they could also increase the

range of their broadcasting.
“Every student could get an
identiﬁcation card free,” he add-
ed. '

“In general, every activity in
the school, whether it is design-
ed for the general student body
or a special segment of the stu-
dents, will be able to expand -its
services and programs through
the activities fee,” Vrana said.

“It can stimulate new activities '

and help activities which are
presently not receiving any,mon-
eyy

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee will undertake a campaign

to educate the student body con-

cerning the distribution of the

$700 tuition and University fee,‘

according to Vrana. They hope
that if this is explained, the stu-

dents will see the rational   

promoting the activities fee.’ A. "

“They will be. able to see how '

much money we don't have and
how the activities fee can. help

the situation,”“Vrana con_tin_ued._ ‘

The education campaign will
be conducted by a Student Af-
fairs steering committee com-

posed of Vrana, "-Michael  - ~

MDC Proposes Food Plan

Alternatives

The, Executive Board and
Cabinet of Men’s Dorm
Council has proposed ﬁve al-
ternatives to the present 21-
meal per week meal ticket
for senior men and women.
Harvey Lefton, MDC presi-
dent, announced at Wednesday's
meeting the list of alternatives
submitted to Helen Rush, dean
of students.

The suggestions include a
choice of lunch and dinner (14
meals per week), breakfast and
dinner (with option of two
lunches on weekends), dinner
only (seven meals weekly), punch
card meal ticket ($14.80 for $16
worth of meals), or no meal tick-
et at « all.

In addition, MDC passed a mo-
tion recommending extended li-
brary hours. It was suggested
that the circulation, reserve, and
reference rooms be open until 11
p.m. Monday through Friday and
from noon to 10 p.m. Sunday. No
change was recommended for
Saturday hours. 1

Final action on the proposal to
have a barber shop installed in
the Towers will not be taken
until next year because of tax

. difficulties.

GRADES

Feb. 12 is the ﬁnal day for
the removal of incomplete or
G grades in the School of Lib-
eral Arts. Any registered stu-
dent with a G grade must ob-
tain permission to purchase an
oﬁicial Grade Change Authori-
zation card.

To obtain this card, a student
must submit to the Dean of
Liberal Arts evidence that the
incompleteness was the result
of forces beyond his control

such as conﬁning illness, a sub- . ii

poena, or a death in the fam-
we ‘ P

The official card must be in

in the Office of the Dean of T

the School of Liberal Arts by
Feb- 15. .All unremoved G
grades of a registered student
will be changed to F3 after
that date.

 
    

 

 

 

 
 
 

 

   

A Statement on Cheating

‘ (Fourth in a ﬁve part series on cheating at the University.)

(The following is a statement prepared for
the Pitt News by Lawrence Lee, professor of
English. He has asked that it appear in its
entirety if printed. The Pitt News considers
the question of academic dishonesty impor-
tant enough to throw it open to public debate.)

MOST MEN, I think, make a contin-
ual effort to live honorably by the best
values which they understand and without
injury to others. Even with good fortune
the effort is not perfect in its achievement.
So, at‘ the earliest moment of awareness,
anyone who wishes to live at peace with
himself would beneﬁt by a conscious cul-
tivation of his own honor. Holding this
view, I cannot help but think that the
young man who asked why anyone should
care whether he cheated or not was not
only young but also morally unperceptive ;
if we did not care we would be slack in our
characters and he would be in grave dan-
ger in his. We do care; and, over and over
again if we must, we shall try to explain why it is important
to care. a
_ It is the nature of man to be uneasy when he hears that
he lives among thieves and murderers. This is to state the
’ issue luridly and yet in a manner which may by shock make
‘ it clear to students, who everywhere are the reason for the
existence of a great University; for the man or woman who
Icheats is a thief of an intellectual possession which he has
not earned and does not own and he does violence to the
rights of others, killing the true nature of learning and of
.1 -testing such learning.
 _ The system is poor enough in the best circumstances

iandastudents, often being but a melancholy alteration of
I that compassionate intimacy which should exist everywhere

1 between a dedicated teacher and a sufficiently limited group

‘_ of students sincerely desirous of knowing. . _ _
‘ Under these happier circumstances, which now exist in

'few places in any country, a sincere teacher knows at what

stage of unfolding the nature of his studentsmay be. When

 ’ féthis is theciscumstance, then written work becomes an act ~

_'of creation and not a function of measurement and detec-

 - vtion. Then the passion to cheat is minimized, though per-
' haps not utterly mastered.

I believe that men desire to be good and honorable, as
they are also generous toward one another in the most diffi-
cult" circumstances. I believe that external pressures in-

~ crease the fear from which students degrade themselves

 jthrough cheating.

When classes are so large that, for example, they may

 interrupt to ask a question which puzzles them but
 not seem to puzzle their fellows, then a situation exists
ggwhich creates a pressure for cheating. When numbers are

‘so great or library volumes so few that an individual cannot
7-”~'.’l:study,a volume which costs too, much for him to own, then

:;., a situation exists which creates a pressure for cheating.

7; These conditions do not exist at Pitt only; they exist in

 tmany universities, and even in those which I think to be the

, most celebrated there is a need_ to be on guard against errors
A of a grave nature. It is certain that I am not alone in this
~ apprehension; here also the men who have power to make
A decisions have considered these _things and they have acted

exhibited two . qualities in com-

as wisely as conditions permitted, even if

I believe that other solutions should have

been sought on some occasions. Yet, these

are some of the outer pressures which
contribute to that failure of honor which
is cheating.

The student himself bears his share
of responsibility. If he will not cheat, he
cannot be made to cheat, even when a
friend or a bullying companion asks or
threatens. All of these crises are a part of
the process by which character is made
'1 secure in its own integrity; and this is
surely one of the main objectives of a true
education, along with the increased seren-
ity of understanding.

There have never been, in my more
than two decades of teaching in several
institutions, students whom I felt more
worthy of teaching than those with whom
I have had the privilege of associating at
The University of Pittsburgh. I have never
_ had a deeper respect for the young any-
where than I -do for those whom I know and have known
here. I believe them capable of responding affirmative y to
an honorable code with great strength and responsibility.
For me the outlines of such a code are simple, however diffi-
cult it might be for some to fulﬁll it: I
—1. The Code should be clearly published at all moments in

the life of the University, so that no student or pro-

fessor or administrator will have a reasonable cause
for doubt.

—2. If a student cheats on any aspect of a course, the pro-
fessor should dismiss the student from that course and
should register a grade of F for the student in that
course.

-3. If any"stude-nt aids another in such an act of cheating,
the assisting student should be judged equally guilty
and should be dismissed from the course with a grade
of F.

—4. If any student is guilty of a second infraction, either of
cheating or of aiding in cheating, that student should
be viewed as one cynical toward the principles of honor
and should -be dismissed permanently from the univers-

. ity.

-—5. A student Honor Committee composed of men and wom-
en elected by the students from each department or
school, not appointed, should exist for appeal. A student
accused of cheating, or of any dishonorable act, believ-
ing himself unjustly accused and desiring to be cleared,
should have the right to face his accuser and to present
any pertinent evidence to the Committee.

—6. The decision of the Honor Committee should be ﬁnal
and should bea part of the student’s record if adverse.
If the student is cleared, his record should be cleared,
including the erroneous grade. '

‘Handles Chancellor

w3Y1‘Hams’1t Up

Russia, Ecuador, and Aus-
tralia are a few varied loca-
tions which the campus ham
radio station, W3YI, has
contacted. The station has
regularly handled message
“traffic” for the Chancellor,
primarily to Quito, Ecuador,

where the University has fac-

ulty members.

The station activities include
more than just operation of the
ham equipment. Stan Schwartz,
the club’s president, is pressing
for the completion of a program
to obtain licensed operators to
provide a message service for the
University community. Students
wishing to call home or send a
“hello” to parents will be able
to do so by means of a nation-
wide network composed of simi-
lar stations which handle mess-
age traffic as a hobby.

Every November the club com-
petes against other college clubs
in a major national contest. Fail-
ure to win can be attributed to
the insufficient number of opera-
tors. This year, however, the
manpower is not only available
but the members are putting ﬁn-
ishing touches on superior equip-

receive an all-purpose ID card

, which would entitle them to all

The money would .be allocated
by a sub.-committee of Student
Affairs and would be approved
by SG- “It will help put those ac-

world-wide “DX Contest." The
contest is sponsored by ham ra-
dio’s largest organization, the
American Radio Relay League,
of which the University is 8
member.

The radio club is presently in A

the process of rebuilding and
overhauling their equipment. The
appearance of the office or
“shack” has been extensively
changed. The cobweb of wire
that used to blot the sky over
Schenley Cafeteria has been re-
placed by two new, more eﬂici-
ent antennas.

Another project is a radio tele
type complex, similar to the net-
work that services all major
newspapers. Upon completion of
the equipment, the club hopes to
enter a nationwide teletype net.
The club’s members hope that
this project will set the Univer-
sity's ham club apart from the
other colleges by having the most
versatile equipment.

These projects, plus the classes

in progress, are all making the
Pitt Amateur Radio Association
the argest and most important of
its type in Western Pennsylvania.

The club meets Wednesdays at
7 p.m. in 328 SU.

Since they took office last spring, the student leaders on the Student Affairs Com-
mittee have been discussing the possibilities of an activity fee. The suggestion, we empha

. size, came from the students, not the administration, as_ a_ means of helping their own ﬁ-
. nancial crises.

For the first time this year, the students W e r e directly involved in allocating

Z; funds to the various student organizations, and also for the ﬁrst time realized how low the
jStudent Affairs ceiling is, how impossible it is to satisfy some organizations’ minimum
budgets with the funds they had available. For the ﬁrst time they could empathize with
’Dr. Alan Rankin when time after time he had to turn down student requests for more
’ money.
’ From ﬁrst hand experience they know the ﬁnanc

_ ial problems of student organiza-
tions: they see established groups like publication operating on budgets ten years out of

date; they see growing organizations like WPGH stunted because they cannot get a lump
investment to put them on their feet; they see creative student efforts like Winter Week-
end forced to charge prices that dull student interest because there is no extramoney to

subsidize them.

The cold facts. say that there is very little chance of getting a significant raise in -
the University appropriation: we are fortunate, in fact, that in light of recent budget
cuts Student Affairs is on the hands-off list, making the sum that we do get even more
precious. Thus, the only answer seems a stu dent-suggested, student-distributed, student-
beneﬁted fee. As Dr. Fredrickson pointed out, the monkey is on our back alone.

But no fee will even be suggested until the student body is fully aware of the
need for it, and this includes clearing up the misconception that the students are already
paying an activities fee under the vague title of the University Fee. The whole $700 ﬂat
fee, as a matter of fact, is misunderstood in terms of what the student is paying for in
relation to what he is receiving.

Within the next couple weeks, The Pitt News will feature several articles ex-
plaining the need for the fee through statem ents and actual breakdowns of tuition and
University Fee payments, the present limitations of the Student Affairs budget, and the
proposed solution of an activities fee.

Quotable Quotes

World History R

eversed

. ’ .
 By Alex D Ippolito

Back in the old days when
love of country was called
patriotism instead of extre-
mism there crept into Amer-
ican thought certain slogans,
cliches, and phrases which
guided the actions of Ameri-
cans in time of national cris-
is.

Today, however, we are.

living in a -different world
in which goals and ideals of
    the past no
longer apply.
In this age
we have new
ideals to fol-
low and hence
new slogans
to guide us.

One of the
problems in-

n'n='roLrro volved in di-
recting American goals 1S,
unfortunately, correcting the
mistakes of the past. With
this in mind, writers of _ to-
day, such as columnist Rich-
ard Starnes, have proposed
that we do a little careful
editing in writing future
United States history books,
and have offered sugges-
tions to that end.

Instead of making George
Washington “first in war,
ﬁrst in peace, ﬁrst in the
hearts of his countrymen”
he can simply be remember-
ed as being “ﬁrst in peace.”

‘ IN PLACE OF the radical
statement Nathan Hale made
about having but one life to
give for his country he can
be translated into more 20th
century terms as saying, “I
regret that I have but one
life, and I want to keep it.”

Perry's dispatch could be
rewritten to say “We have
met the enemy, and they
are human beings like our-
selves.”

That patriotic nut who
told his troops “Don’t fire
until you see the whites of

 

school children more about
modern diplomacy if his
wording could be improved
to say “Don’t ﬁre until they
have had a chance to accept
our latest concession.”

It would be much easier to
teach today’s youth the vir-
tue of tolerance if the un-
compromising motto “Don’t
tread on me” which appear-
ed on the ﬂags of the early
American Navy ships could
to tread on me, please.”

Certainly if Barbara Frit-
chie’s plea to the Confeder-
ate soldiers were changed to
the more believable “Take if
you must this old, torn flag
but spare my old, gray head”
history would become more
meaningful for the average
pupil.

Kids would be able to see
that the whole Spanish-
American War could have
been avoided if we had said
“Forget the Maine,” and our

heritage could be something.

we Americans could be proud
of if only we had been moti-
vated to say “Fifty-four for-
ty or an appropriate com-
promise. ”

MAYBE WE could show
school kids that we wouldn't
be having trouble in the Pa-
ciﬁc today if General Mac-
Arthur had said “I shall re-
turn, maybe” and that we
could have avoided Viet Nam
if he had improved on his
Korean War statement to
read “In war there is no sub-
titute f o r a negotiated
peace.”

Although Woodrow Wil-
son’s -heart was in the right
place some of his words were

misplaced for an age as
complicated as ours. His be-
lief that the ﬁrst world war
was a war “to make the
world safe for democracy”
could be understood better
by the nonaligned, undemo-
cratic nations if we would
have said that World War

I was a war to “make the

world safe.”

Much confusion could be
eliminated in young minds
if it could be pointed out
that what Teddy Roosevelt
really meant was “Speak
softly.”

WINSTON CHURCHILL
could be assured a place of
greatness in history if some
of his worse pronouncements
could be modiﬁed. Instead of
his saying “We shall ﬁght
on the beaches, We shall ﬁght
on the landing grounds, we
shall ﬁght in the ﬁelds and
in the streets, we shall ﬁght
in the hills; we shall never
surrender” corrections could
be made so that it would
read, “We shall negotiate on
the beaches, we shall parlay
on the landing grounds, we
shall seek a meeting of the
minds whether it be in the
ﬁelds or in the streets; we
shall never surrender our
hopes for a peaceful settle-
men .” s

“With textbooks like these
the next generation would be
trained to view problems in
a more contemporary man-
ner. The only problem to-
day’s teacher would face
would be the smart alecky
kid who asks “What does
total victory mean?” ’

Letters to the Editor

Director Denies

Health Charge

Editor, The Pitt News:

One of the basic purposes of
the Student Health Service, as
stated by its director on Jan. 28,
is to provide students with “good
clinical medical care 24 hours a
day.” However, the Student
Health Service is failing to carry
out this important function.

In the past three years I have
had the misfortune to require the
frequent service of a doctor.
Luckily my problems have either
arisen during or been able to
wait until regular office hours: 9
’ti1 4:15, Monday through Fri-
day- This past Sunday was the
ﬁrst time I hadn’t been ill Mon-
day through Friday between 9
and 4:15.

My problem was certainly not
a matter of life-or-death, so I
waited until the regularly sched-
uled time for visits on Sundays:
2 ’til 2:45 p.m. At 2:10 I found
that the doctor was not in the
Health Service and that four
other students had also tried to
obtain medical attention. Ten
minutes later, a call to the Uni-
versity operator revealed that
probably the doctor was on a
case at Presbyterian-University
Hospital. At 2:30 the operator
reported that she had reached
the doctor and that he would be
down immediately. He arrived at
3 p.m., an hour late.

If the Health Service is to
serve the general student body,
a doctor should be in the office
at least during scheduled hours.
How can medical care be pro-
vided 24 hours a day if no doc-
tor is present?

Student Asks
For More Time

Editor, The Pitt News: '

Although Joel Beeler’s evalua-
ation of the trimester system
(The Pitt News, Jan. 25, “Tri-
mester Examined”) was too se-
vere, he recognized a familiar
student complaint — lack of time.
Osmosing and assimilating all the

material that is represented by

  

12 to 18 credits is indeed impos-
sible in the short space of 15
weeks.

Unfortunately, his proposal to
reduce a “l5-week maze” to a
six-week maze, followed by a
six-week recuperation period is
unrealistic. A more practical sol-
ution would be to extend the
length of each trimester by about
a week and to introduce an in-
terim period before exams.

Health Service
Called Lacking

Editor, The Pitt News:

An article in the Jan 26 News
refers to “the student health fee.”
This is not correct for there has
not been a student health fee
since September, 1964, at the
University of Pittsburgh- The fee
referred to is the premium for
the Hospitalization Insurance
which the University sponsors
and requires all full-time resi-
dence hall students to have.

This insurance is complemen-
tal to the Student Health Serv-
ice services for those students re-
quired to have the insurance and
supplemental to the Student
Health services for other full-
time students who may purchase
the insurance optionally.

I believe there are some im-
portant distinctions between a
student health fee (or absence of
Such) and insurance premiums,
and that students should be
aware of these differences. It is
mainly for this reason that I
call your attention to the mat-
ter.

Ruby Showing
Hot Shooting

The Panther basketball
team makes an infrequent

visit to their own court to- _

morrow night as they meet
Fordham University, at 8 :15
p.m. The Panthers will be

after their third win in four .

games.

Fordham has had two common
opponents with the Panthers so
far this season, and has beaten
both of them- Fordham defeated
Army by three points at the
Rams’ home court. and they also
defeated Massachusetts soundly
in the Queens City Tournament.

Massachusetts lost to the Pan-
thers last Friday 'night by 15
points and the Panthers lost to
Army at West Point by 25 points.
“I don’t think Fordham could
have beaten Army at West Point,”
said coach Bob Timmons, “No-
body wins up there.

“Fordham is a good team,”
said Timmons, “I watched them
upset Temple on television a con-
ple of weeks ago and they have
good size and that (Bill) Stev-
ens boy at six-foot-ﬁve is a good
scorer.” They have three players
back from last year, Stevens,
Mike Zandy and Tom McGuirt.

Timmons will keep the same
line-up against Fordham as he
used last week end and against

- Westminster last Monday. He is

extremely happy with the play
of two‘ players in particular the
last few games.

“Brian, Fisher has done an ex-
cellent job for us and I intend to

keep him in there,” said Tim-
mons,” he has driven well, play-
ed good defense, and has made
several key steals. It seems as
if when Fisher plays well the
whole team plays we .”

Daryle Ruby is the other play-
er Timmons has been enthusias-
tic about. “Ruby, as captain, felt
all he had to do was sort of
coast when in the game. We had

a talk and he seems to have
snapped out of it and has been

hustling and shooting very well .

He has been hitting his jump shot
against the zone that the teams
have been putting up against
us.”

After the three games the Pan-
thers played in four‘ days 'I‘im-
mons was .a little worried about
the condition of his team against
Westminster on Monday night.

“I couldn’t substitute much
against Westminster because the
game was so close,” Timmons ex-
plained. “I only substituted once

' in the ﬁrst half, when I put Dave

Blyshak in for Bob Lovett. And
once in the second half when I
put Roth McNally in for Fish-
er. The boys held up real well
and didn’t look as travel weary
as they did against Dartmouth
last Saturday there shouldn’t
be any problems about tiring to-
morrow night-”

game to the students in the
Dorms as has been done the en-
tire season.
