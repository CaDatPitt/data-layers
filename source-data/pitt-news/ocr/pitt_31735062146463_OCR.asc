’. The activities of the Southern

Californ_ia a1umni- grou'p,'—under the

guidance of Doctors J, W. Shuman

and F. -A. Rhodes have stirred up the
Northern California crowd, as indi-
letter from M. 
COL, '20,“ active
- He
asks for aicomplete list of alumni in
“our part of the States’, adding:
- “This ‘ thingof the Southern
California bunch ‘getting ‘so.
, blooming active, all of a sudden. .
,get_s' my goat. We want to show
‘them just what [real ‘activity is
- in the Northern. part of the
, State, which includes every-’
.‘ thingnorth of the city limits‘_of
iLos Angeles, except Santa Bar-
bara,” V . , I
“Mike” writes an interesting style
of Pi-tt news, commencing on items
which he gleaned from The __ Pitt
Weekly. He says, in part;
. “It is ‘lucky that I only spent
1 two years at Pitt‘, instead of the
usual four. Here I am, riding
onithe Southern Paciﬁc, between
Fresno and home, and nobody
with a grain of good sense,
would sit quietly reading, sleep-
ing or looking out the window,
when he "has .a pleasant ﬁve-
hour ride ahead of him, with the
air full of San Joaquin Valley
dust,_, and the thermometer mer-

‘the tube, but my quietude has
been ‘completely upset. It may
be lack of good sense, but I apre- “
fer to think it is the lastcopy
of The Pitt Weekly, which I
have with me. Here I am heat-
ing up-thei bearings of my little
portable typewritelifﬁover a mere
impulse. I suppose if I had spent

M four years at Pitt I would have
been carrying a Hoe
aroundato write letters on.

‘‘I «noticed a lot of things‘
which interested me in this
(April 23) issue. One thing was
the Band Concert. That was one
of our dreams in the days when

T I was keeping the cadence on
the bass drum, and later, when
-1 took the ‘silver stick for a
couple of seasons, but we never
got anywhere with the idea. We,

and often spent some mighty
cold hours on the side lines with-
out them. I see.;’by thepicture,
. that the ‘boys have'_now, been
_ well ii_xed‘up,.a’nd I feel a little
thrill “at having been an early -
member of so successful an or-
iganization. Another column re-
ports the marriage of Bill Greg-
ory. No doubt, Bill’s charm was
greatly enhanced by‘ that white
cap in which he used to parade
with us. a . . 7 '.
“The rifle‘ team, which you
seem to have developediwin late
years, is one of the. finest ‘addi-
tions to your sports’ program, in
my estimation. 1 am sorry not
. to hear anything more of the
aeronautical team, nor even of,
they journalistic fraternity, Delta.
Sigma Chi, but, perhaps, I have
not been following The Weekly
regularly enough. We hear a
~ great deal more of riﬂe team

The music of “All in a Day’? was‘ i

‘outstanding. Gus Schnabel, the.‘ mu-
sical director, was responsible Ltor

stage director;

George MacDonald, the student man-
-ager of “All in a Day” -for the capable
manner in which the performances
were executed. An alumnus who was
the author or the club's vehicle--a. few
years ago remarked after seeing, the

given.” l‘ Ma-cnonald, who-lea :Junior

__ner. Inno other event, be it dash,
distance, ﬁeld or weight, will_.we
concede Carnegie an entrant, better
than the -best Pittman. -In the two-

us -skeptical. Nevertheless,‘ Lafter
looking at each man, :Tedf Corbett.
Pitt, and Dykeman, -Tech, we would
only be pleasantly, surprised to see
a‘ few honors change hands. ’ ‘
Dykeman has, beaten Corbett in
the past,’ we admit. ,.He ran second

run, but dig,h’t*enter ’the«Penn Re-

pic ‘try-outs. At this» time, each is
in perfect condition from’ weeks of,
training; Last Saturday, Dykeman
won his race from Geneva by lapping
two men and finishing in 10:31, and
Corbett won just as handily’ from
West '_Virginia. in 10:09. Neither
time means much, _as neither man
was pushed.» - .

When looking at each as a run-
ner, we notice that ‘Dykeman works
harder for the whole distance, using
a. longer stride. Corbett, appears -to
make an ‘easierjob of two-miles and,
to us, has a. smoother body and arm
