Presidential candidate addresses stud

By Jennifer Calabrese
News Editor

Communication is the key for improving
the relationship between a university
administration and students, Pitt
presidential candidate Gershon Vincow
told student leaders yesterday.

“A lot can be accomplished simply by
opening up chains of communication and
chains of command and finding out what
is on students’ minds and equally trying to
tell students what is on the mind of the
institution so that we can work together,”

. Vincow, the vice chancellor at Syracuse

University, said. Vincow is among five or
six finalists being considered to succeed
current president Wesley Posvar.
Vincow was interviewed by members of
the Student Affairs Advisory Council as

   
    

part of his two-day visit to the Pitt campus.
Vincow opened the session by discussing
some of the projects and goals with which
he is involved.

Improving undergraduate instruction has
been a “very significant mission" for
Vincow. This year Vincow said he surprised
many of his colleagues by signing up to be
a freshman advisor.

“To me it was very refreshing because it
was to see the curriculum from another
point of view -— from the view of the new
student——while helping this person select
their curriculum,” he said.

Part of Vincow’s approach to improving
undergraduate education includes
communicating with student groups.

“I went to see the executive board of the
student government, and we saw that we
had so much in common that they invited

me to their assembly,” Vincow said. “I
found it very interesting because I talked
about what I wanted to do academically
for students, and they talked about the
problems that there were for undergraduate
students.”

On the basis of that dialogue Vincow
was able to make necessary improvements,
he said. ‘

“There was aproblem connected with
computer clusters, and there was no 24-
hour study space before exams. What we
did was open up the student union two or
three weeks before exams and some of
the student [computer] clusters. That was
on the basis of a dialogue which had not
existed before,” Vincow said.

Brent Saunders asked Vincow about

"This is a sad day for the educational community."

Kinko’s loses copyright suit

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Sta_ﬂ' Writer

On March 28, a decision was
reached in U.S. District Court
limiting the rights of Kinko’s
Copies to supply course materials
to professors and students.

The decision was contingent
upon the Basic Booles vs. Kinko’s
Graphics Corporation lawsuit,
decided in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New
York.

“[Kinko’sl lost [the court case],
so we’re following the court
ruling,”said Mark Nycz, manager
of the Kinko’s store located at
3945 Forbes Avenue in Oakland.

The court has limited the rights
of commercial establishments to
provide copies of educational
materials for classroom use.

“This is a sad day for the
educational community,” said
Kurt Koenig, Kinko’s vice
president and counsel.
“Professors across the country
depend upon Kinko’s to help
them provide up-to-date course
materials for their students.

“Professors and students who
depend upon this timely material
will suffer as a result of this court
decision," added Koenig.

According to Kinko’s Graphics
Corporation, based in Ventura,
Calif., the guidelines outlined in
the court’s decision limits the
fair-use doctrine in the copyright
law. I

Kinko’s also stated that the case
was designed to reinterpret the
1976 CopyrightAct, which allows
university faculty members to
make multiple copies of
copyrighted materials for
classroom use under the act's
“Fair Use” clause.

The corporation added that it
will no longerbe able to distribute
packets until they have been
reviewed to ensure they comply
with the judge's criteria.

The lawsuit began in April 1989
when eight textbook publishers
filed suit against Kinko’s.

“Through the Kinko’s Service
Corporation Rights and
Permissions Center, [Kinko’s] is
well—equipped to abide by these
new standards and implement

full compliance measures at all of

our Kinko’s Copy Centers across —

the country,” said Koenig.

“With our copyright-
permissions systems, numerous
publisher agreements and overall
investment in education, we will
continue to serve the educational
community," added Koenig.

Kinko’s Corporation stated that
because of the timing of the court
decision, students may not be
receiving course materials in time
for the upcoming semester.

The corporation added that it is
working with professors to make
materials available as quickly as
possible.

In order to comply with the
court’s decision, Paul J. Orfalea,
chairperson of Kinko’s Graphics
Corp., said Kinko’s stores are
taking the following actions:

-Any original material or
material that is not copyrighted
will be made available for students
immediately.

-If copyright permission has
been granted on classroom
materials, then the materials will

Faculty Assembly endorses BAS demands for campus reform

By Jenifer Crook
Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

Calling for a university plan to
combat Pitt's deficiencies in
recruiting and retaining black
faculty and students, the Faculty
Assembly passed a resolution
yesterday supporting the Black
Action Society's demands for
improving campus conditions for
black students.

“The committee commends the
Black Action Society for its
offering of suggestions to make
[Pittl ‘a recommendable university’
from the standpoint of recruitment
and retention of black faculty
and students,” the resolution
states.

to public-service projects.

Honoring profs for public
service projects supported

Although exceptional Pitt professors are honored annually
for their research andteaching skills, no university awards are
given ‘to faculty members who donate their time and expertise

“I know literally hundreds of faculty in the [Faculty of Arts and
see Service, page:

In February, the BAS listed 14
demands that it said must be met
before it would recommend Pitt
to black students. Of those
demands, the FA specifically

endorsed three: increased funding
for the University Challenge for
Excellence financial-aid program,
which has not been adjusted for
cost-of-living increases in 15

years; a university plan for
increased’ employment and
retention of black faculty; and a
university plan for hiring black
faculty in areas in which there are
presently none.

The resolutions were forwarded
to the FA yesterday by the Senate
committee on admissions and
financial aid. All three passed
unanimously.

Professor Harold Gordon,
chairperson of the senate
committee, said that the shortage
of black faculty is a serious
problem.

“We feel it impacts on black-
student admissions and
retentions. We want to bring these
issues to the public,” he said.

The FA resolution also calls for
university research projects to
pinpoint ways to retain black
students.

“We want someone to ﬁgure
out if these students just need
funding or if they need
counseling, tutoring or other
services to keep them enrolled,”
said Gordon.

In light of the state’s and the
university’s tight budget, the
resolution suggests that the
university solicit more funding
from third parties.

“There’s a lot of funds that can
be attracted from non-
governmental sources; there just
needs to be someone to get out
‘there and get them,” Gordon said.

Pitt’s Student Government
Board last night held the inaugural
meeting of a community crime
watch program that will for the
first time involve both Pitt students
and permanent residents of
Oakland.

According to SGB member
Andrew Gould, who started the
Crime Stop program, the purpose
of the meeting was to try to
encourage students and
permanent residents of the 200
to 300 block of Oakland Ave. to
formally sign up and become
involved with the program.

Gould added that this is a pilot
project which, if successful, will
be expanded to all of the
residence halls and possibly all
of the off—campus areas in

‘Oakland where students live.

“This is’ the first stage," said
Gould, who added that the project
will be similar to the crime watch
project that has already been
initiated at the Lothrop and Tower

A residence halls, except that it
will involve cooperation between
students and permanent residents
of the area.

The meeting at Forbes Quad-
rangle was attended by represent-
atives from the organizations
involved with the project: the
SGB, the university's Department
of Public Safety, the Pittsburgh
city police department, the South
Oakland Citizens Council, and
the students and residents of the
area.

According to Sgt. Charles Grier
of Pitt’s Dept of Public Safety, the
200 to 300 block of Oakland Ave.
was chosen because the university
owns a lot of property there. He
said the idea behind the program
is to get off—campus students
actively involved with their own

security and with the rest of the

community.

Grier said “captains” will be
chosen by student residents of
apartment buildings and houses,
and it will be their job to keep
track of the building's residents
and to keep a phone network

operating to gather and dispense
information.

Grier added that the program
will also involve greater sharing
of crime statistics between the
Pittsburgh city police and
university campus police to help
pinpoint areas where crimes are
occurring and “so we can get
information where it's warranted
quickly.”

Grier said that crime
information will be provided in
bulletins to persons involved in
the program.

Grier said by getting residents
actively involved with their own
security, it is hoped that incidents
of crime will decrease and the
fear of crime will also decrease.

“We want this thing to grow so
that we can enhance the quality
of life for everybody, particularly
in the area of public safety,” he
said.

According to Pat Scanlon,
executive director of the South
Oakland Citizens Council,
students also need to know how
to report crimes to the police and

\

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, April 3, 1991

 

SGB Crime Watch program expands to South Oakland

what actions to take if they
observe a crime or suspicious
activity in their area.

“If you don’t report the crime,
it doesn't exist,” said Scanlon,
who is the founder of South
Oakland’s crime watch program.

Scanlon said she hopes that
communication between students
and permanent residents will also
lead to a better understanding of
problems that exist between the
two groups. Scanlon said, “We
hope that better community
relations come out of these
efforts."

According to Officer Sandy
Verbish of the Pittsburgh city
police department, this program
is unique in the country because
“no place else are communities,
colleges and police departments
getting together.”

Verbish said that national
statistics indicate that effective
crime watch programs in other
communities can reduce crime
by an average of 25 percent.

t Mean old man?...

Life—1ong Oakland resident tries to cope with changing neighborhood

By Wendy Prostko
For The Pitt News

In rain, in snow, in dead of
night, he emerges from the
shadows, ﬂashlight in hand and
baseball cap pulled over his eyes.
He keeps a safe distance from his
young patrons.

“Two dollars plus tax to park
here ‘til 6 a.m.," he announces.

“What? Pay? I only have three
bucks on me,” most of the drivers
protest. They are only looking for
a place to park their cars safely
within the realm of the happening
Oakland scene.

Most pay reluctantly, too
frustrated to aimlessly circle for a
street space close by. Others
speed off, leaving a fantail of
gravel spewing from beneath their
spinning tires and screaming
obscenities.

This usually happens in front
of a crowd of jeering observers
looking over the balconies of
nearby apartments.

“It’s become quite a spectator
sport, and right here from our
porches we have a bird’s-eye
view,” said Pitt junior Craig Segar.

“Some nights it’s better than TV.”

After the meter maids go home,
many of Oakland's outrageously
priced parking spaces are
believed to be free game —— and
free of charge.

But John Katzur, owner of the
parking lot on the corner of
Dawson and Bouquet streets, sees
things differently.

“Well, it’s simple. When I go to
bed at night, I want to get to
sleep. When you kids wake me
up, I come out, and you don’t get
to park for free," Katzur said.

Then, while onlookers jeer and
taunt, Katzur either collects his
money or catches a face full of
pebbles from the spinning wheels
of an angry driver.

The sometimes—scared but
never scared-away, 79-year-old
lifetime resident of Oakland and
his 72-year-old wife Mary Ann try
to live normal lives —- lives they
feel have been dramatically
altered by the college students’
takeover of the neighborhood.

Most weekend nights the
Katzurs lay awake because of the
noise from parties. Their yard
becomes a public Port—a—_Iohn,

and recently their living-room
window was a bull’s-eye target
for a ﬂying beer bottle.

Although their lives have been
disturbed, moving to a new
location is not how they want to
solve their problems.

“I grew up in this neighborhood
and raised my kids here. The wife
and I built this lot here with our
own two hands because we didn’t
have the money to pay someone
to do it. The kids just don’t realize
how hard we’ve worked for what
we have,” said Katzur.

As Katzur and his wife walked
outside, they remembered when
they got engaged.

“We have many fond memories
of this neighborhood. Just over
the hill at Panther Hollow Lake is
where we had our engagement
party,” said Mrs. Katzur.

“Believe it or not, it was 50
years ago that I hid her ring in a
hot dog, and I had to stop her

before she ate it," said Katzur.

But Katzur has a reputation
among students as a greedy old
man.

Katzur said, “What people don’t
understand is that I’m not in it for
the money. It doesn't mean
anything to me."

His wife claims that Katzur is
not a selfish man.

“He gives it away as fast as he
gets it —— always to people in
need,” she said.

"I don’t want to approach
bragging. I’m only emphasizing
the fact that I don’t do it out of
greed. I'm sorry if they're bitter
against me. If they are, I don’t
know how to prevent it," Katzur
said.

After a while, Katzur
disappeared into the house and
then reappeared on the walkway
in front of the large, cracked,
concrete driveway.

He looked across the yard with

his steel—blue eyes. His hands
were rough, worn and wrinkled
— hands of a worker — and he
smiled more frequently as he
spoke.

He walked to the front of the
house, and he pointed out the
place where some pine trees that
his children once planted used to
stand.

“The wife and I used to take the
children to the country so that
they could see what it was like
away from the city. The farmer let
them take home small evergreen
saplings one trip, and they planted
them here in the yard," Katzur
said.

But one weekend night, the
tops were cut off for Christmas
trees.

Katzur said, “I try to be positive
and overlook it as youth. I realize
that it’s not all the kids — just a
few bad apples.”

reconciling research and
undergraduate education within
a university.

Vincow said that a university
has to attempt to perform both
academic and research functions
as well. Syracuse is similar to Pitt
in terms of its large research
facilities, graduate programs and
membership in the American
Association of Universities.

“You have got to figure out a
way in which one can
complement the other,” Vincow
said. “All institutions are different,
and all have their own traditions.
You [also] have to take into
account what the faculty feel
about this.” I

Saunders also inquired about
Vincow’s views on affirmative
action.

Since he is the chief academic
officer at Syracuse, Vincow said

‘rm-3 PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, April 3, 1991

he would address the "significant
need at every institution to
increase the number of African-
American faculty.”

Vincow started a program at
Syracuse in which funds are held
back every year and then the
various schools and colleges are
asked to write out proposals
outlining what minorities they
could conceivably attract.

“Our strategy has been to go
after some significant faculty
members who have an impact on
the whole institution by their
coming," he said.

Vincow said that there are many
problems a university encounters
in trying to attract and hire
minority faculty. One problem is
looking for a defined candidate.

“When you define a faculty
search and you start to search for

chemistry, you narrow the field
to maybe 10, 15 or 20 people,” he
said. “Leaving the project open
on the sides and saying that, in
the context of a large university,
surely we should be able to find
five outstanding people a year in
fields that we happen to need but
may notbe searching for is more
successful."

Another problem is convincing
a candidate to leave the university
they are currently at, Vincowsaid.»

“The issue is can you convince
outstanding people to uproot their
families and believe that there is
a good life at your university,”
Vincow said.

Presidential search committee
chairperson Farrell Rubenstein
told SAAC members about
Vincow’s reputation in the area
of affirmative action.

“What I had heard is that you
are putting money where you
mouth is. You are making a
serious, honest effort,” Rubenstein
said.

Vincow said that hiring more
minority faculty was the short
term solution to the problem.
Vincow said he has been workin g
very actively on the long term
solution -- increasing the number
of minorities in doctoral programs.

Lisa Campoli, the
undergraduate representative on
the presidential-search
committee, asked Vincow how
he planned to get his ideas and
messages to students at a
university as large as Pitt.

Vincow said that a student
round table which would meet
with the president periodically to
discuss concerns might be one
answer to that problem.

Panhellenic association
President Sandra Kramer asked
Vincow about his views on the
Greek system.

“The Greek systems nationally
have become much more
responsible about alcohol. I
believe they are going to lead the
way for the rest of the campuses,”
Vincow said.

The system offers freshman
support when they first come to
a university, Vincow said.

“The Greek system offers an
opportunity in a difficult
environment. It is something

which you can bond with -- like '

a new, surrogate family,” he said.

The Faculty Assembly hopes to
change that. Yesterday the group
voted overwhelmingly to support
a senate community-relations

recommendations for university
recognition of -faculty public-

-Developing institutional

could include the establishment
of an “excellence in public service

Km/eo’s copiers canned...

Many students at Pitt have complained about the
escalating prices of books. Now, along with the expected
cost increase, the number of necessary books for classes
will probably also rise. “

On March 28, U.S. District Judge Constance Baker
Motley ruled that Kinko's Graphics Corporation’s right to
print copyrighted materials would be limited. In short, it
means that Kinko’s will be restricted in its ability to
distribute smaller, cheaper packets of previously printed
material.

The decision stemmed from a 1989 court case filed
against Kinko's Graphics Corporation by eight textbook
publishers which wanted a new interpretation ofthe 1976
Copyright Act. This act allows faculty members of a
university to make copies of copyrighted materials for

use in the classroom. Motley, a judge in the Southern New

York District, ruled that their ability to do this through
companies such as Kinko's would now be restricted.

Students who need small amounts of information will
now be forced to buy the original texts. Instead of buying
a small packet with important, relevant information,
students will have to buy more material and therefore
spend more money to get the same amount of information.

Currently, professors send a collection of material to
Kinko’s and requests that copies be made. Kinko's, in
return, processes the packets and charges students for
them. I

With this decision, however, students may beforced to
find other sources of information. For example, instead
of looking through a small booklet for information from
a magazine, students will have to find that magazine in
the library.

The students, however, are not the only ones hurt by
this decision. Professors will now be limited in their
ability to produce handy material for students. Without
this information, many of the theories presented in
classes will have to be independently researched by
students. ‘

Professors also should not be expected to pick up the
additional charges. As any student knows, copying a
page costs money. Copying hundreds of pages, however,
costs a lot more. Instead of the professors handling that
extra charge, it will most likely be passed on to students.

Kurt Koenig, vice president and counsel for Kinko’s,
said, “This is a sad day for the educational community.
Professors across the country depend upon Kinko’s to
help them provide up-to-date course materials for their
students.” .

Unfortunately for students, it restricts their access to this
material, downgrading their education. And students at
the University of Pittsburgh realize that they already
spend enough for that ‘

Dead enemy...

Warsaw Pact failure not all good

The mighty bear has fallen in
the East.

The Warsaw Pact, the formal
military alliance of Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union, has ceased
to be. On Monday, the alliance
formally dissolved, leaving the
Soviet Union alone in defending
its borders. I think that it’s now
safe to say that the Cold Waris
ofﬁcially over.

Quick history lesson: After
World War II, Joseph Stalin
decided that he didn’twant to see
the Soviet Union invaded any
more (three times in the past 150
years). A quick solution to this
would be to create a buffer
between it and the evil empires
to the West. So Unclejoe overran
everything east of Berlin, called it
Communist and put in his own
puppets (governments, not
Kermit and Miss Piggy).

This alliance wasn't exactly
stable during its "prime," either.
Uprisings in 'Eastern Europe were
frequent and often bloody, as
shown by the Hungary uprising
of 1956, where some 20,000 died
at the hands of Soviet troops and
tanks.

So what does this mean? World
peace has finally come to us? We
can stop making weapons, feed
the hungry and play nice guy the
world over? We can do that now,
right? '

Not quite.

Just because our former
enemies to the East have suddenly
become our buddies doesn't
mean they’re the most stable of
buddies. Eastern European
countries all have one thing in
common: Their economies are in
the toilet. When people don't
have money, they aren't happy.
And until they get that money, it
is plausible that they will try any

 

Jeff
Tatusko

way possible to get it.

Now, before everybody starts
believing Vaclav Havel is the next
Saddam Hussein, hang on for a
minute. I’m not predicting that

the Eastern Europeans will come '

after us, one after another. I doubt
very highly that they would. That
would only result in the
destruction of those countries.
(Maybe Saddam isn't such a bad
analogy.)

But behind them is a small
place called the Soviet Union.
Again, not exactly the bastion of
stability, especially today. Civil
war is a real possibility.
Demonstrations have even started
popping up in, of all places,
Moscow. (You get the feeling
Uncle Joe is doing ﬂips in his
grave.) Lithuania, Latvia, Georgia,
Moldavia, Armenia, Azerbaijan——
all of these have held some sort
of demonstrations against the
government. Boy, next thing you
know, they’ll be screaming for
abortion rights and world peace.
(Sorry, that was a cheap shot.)
Anyway, when all of this settles
down, I get the feeling that Uncle
Gorby ain't gonna be in charge
any more. Now that the Soviet
people have had a taste of

capitalism, they’re not going to
be satisfied with anything less
than a total free market. And

- even though Gorbachev might

want that, there are still too many
conservatives in the government
to let him have it. (Honest, this is
leading somewhere.)

If these people do not get what
they want, civil war could break
out. If that happens, the
government could very well
decide that it needs someone
from the military to lead the
country. And glasnost or not, this
won't be good news for the West.

Getting back to my world—peace
scenario, Europe still won't be
very stable. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization was formed
to counter the Soviet_Union, not
just the Warsaw Pact. Therefore,
it must stay intact. The Soviet
Union will now have to fight
through its former alliance
partners in order to get to
Germany. By that time I think it’s
safe to say that we would have at
least noticed and would be able
to do something about it.

But even if this happened, we
still won't need the troops that
are stationed there now. And
current treaty negotiations are
working to get some more of our
troops home. However, some
formidable U.S. military presence
must remain in order to show
that we will defend Europe.

Yeah, I know. This is all
hypothetical, and maybe I'm
leaning farther to the right in my
old age. But hey, you never know.
Of course, not too many people
believed we would send troops
into the desert to fight back in
June, now, did they?

Here we go again! The Wales
Conference playoffs begin tonight in
four cities across our fair nation.
Unfortunately for a few teams, their
entrance into the postseason ball will
abruptly turn into an exit. Let’s have a
look, shall we?

PATRICK DIVISION

Pittsburgh 41-33-6 vs. New Jersey
32-33~15

Season Series: Pittsburgh 4-3

New Jersey comes in slumping,
particularly on the road where it has not
won in eight games and has only
recorded nine total road wins. Pittsburgh
is hot, having gone 9-2-2 since the big
trade with Hartford, en route to capturing
its first-ever Patrick crown.

The Pens won’t be satisfied unless
they’re playing in May, while Newjersey
might be happier to end it right now.
Don’t count on a rout, though; New
Jersey has a plethora of fine goal scorers,
and the Devils are tough at home.

Wale s tal

Brian
Berger

During the season series the home team
won every game, but the Pens are clearly
the team to beat in this division. Another
stat on N.J.: Against the Patrick playoff
teams, it is 0-10-2 on the road. Pittsburgh
should sweep at home, and the Devils will
never see game six. Pittsburgh in five.

New York Rangers 36-31-13 vs.
Washington 37-36-7

Season Series: New York 4-2-1

Another tale of two cities heading into
opposite directions when the season came
to a close. The Capitals gained access to
the priority event by going 9-4-2 in March
while the Rangers choked up first place
by winning two of its last 13. This series
could turn ugly. Both teams are physical

The next time Penguin goaltender Frank Pietrangelo refreshes himself on the ice will be during one of the Pens‘ postseason appointments as Patrick Division Champions.

Pens in five while Caps, Bruins and Sabres prevail

and goon-infested.

Washington goalie Don “How old am I?”
Beaupre is second in the league in goals-
against average and recorded back-to-
back shutouts last weekend. Having a hot
goaltender often wins a playoff series.
Meanwhile, the Rangers’ rietminding
situation has suddenly turned to a
shambles. Coach Roger Nielsen has
alternated rookie Mike Richter and John
Van Biesbrouck all year, but now Beezer
is on the trading block, and Nielsen has
indicated that Richter is the man. Baffling
move.

The Rangers do not look at all like the
team that reigned Mount Patrick much of
the season, but more like the team that the
Pens drilled in four games two years ago
in the playoffs. (Remember that when Phil
Esposito fired his coach right before the
series?) Washington has made it to the
playoffs for nine straight years, sometimes
with great talent, but always because of its
commitment to play defense. Interesting

ranked power-play unit (New York) vs.

Hartford is in deep trouble. The

Men’s tennis punishes Fifth Avenue rival Carnegie Mellon

By Arthur Graziani
Stalf Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
men’s tennis team traveled to
Carnegie Mellon yesterday and
defeated the Tartans with a
balanced attack. The Panthers
(10-7) captured every match
except No.1 singles to win 7-1
against their local rival.

The team got off to a good
start; three of the singles matches

were over within 45 minutes.
Seniors Jeff Mills, No. 3 seed,
Terry O’Connor at No. S and
junior john Tegano at No. 4
quickly dispatched their
opponents.

Pitt’s balance is one of the main
reasons for its success this year.
Freshman David Ginder, who
won his match in straight sets, 6-
2, 6-3, feels that balance is very
important. “We have a lot of
balance on this team,” said Ginder.

“On any given day one of us
could lose, but the balance keeps
us from suffering too much. We
usually match up pretty well.”
In the second set, Ginder
strained a muscle in his shoulder
but went on to finish the set by
holding serve. “I just went back,
and I don’t know. It just stiffened,
but 1 was able to finish," said
Ginder. In the No. 2 singles
matchup, junior Larry Garrard of
Pitt defeated Mike Beaudry in

straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. The match
was closer than the score
indicated, as both players were
able to take command of the
game. Garrard prevailed by
constantly charging the net,
keeping Beaudry chasing his
shots from one end of the court
to the other.

The only loss of the afternoon
was suffered by Pitt's Eric Weaver
at the hands CM’s Andrew Lee in
a grueling match which lasted

almost three hours. Lee was able
to make the comeback with much
the same style as Garrard:
charging the net. Weaver won
the first set, 6-3, with his powerful
serve, but Lee won the second
set, 62. In the third set each
player kept the pressure on by
using controlled serves. The final
set went to a tie breaker, with Lee
winning the tie breaker (7-6), the
set and the match.

Baseball team wins one, drops two to UCo1m

By Bob Maselli
Smﬂ Writer

While everyone was home this past
weekend enjoying their Easter or Passover
celebrations, the Pitt Panther baseball
team was in Storrs, Conn. playing the
1990 Big East Tournament Champion
University of Connecticut in a three-game
series.

The Panthers came home with one win
and two losses, posting their Big East
record at 1-5 and 11—15 overall.

On Friday, with the score tied 5-5 in the

seventh inning, the game was delayed
until Saturday because of darkness. When
the game resumed the following afternoon
(snow delayed the game even longer), the
Panthers grabbed two runs to take the
victory, 7-5.

The winning runs were scored in the
seventh when Ralph McNelly cranked a
double, sending home Greg Christman to
take the lead. In the ninth, an insurance
run was added when Ernie Massa laid
down a suicide squeeze bunt scoring
Bryan Henne. Pitcher Chris Wittgartner
grabbed the win.

“We played really good in the first
game," said Massa. “We were never down,
and everyone came together. If we played
like that every game, we would have
swept UConn."

Because of the schedule changes, the
Panthers had to play the second game on
Saturday and the third on Easter Sunday,
when they were supposed to come home.

The Panthers dropped the next two
games, 6-2 and 13-6.

The only bright spot of the game on
Sunday was UConn’s first baseman Mark
Rosenthal. Rosenthal went 4-6 with four

doubles. All six of the Panthers’ pitchers
were used throughout the weekend.
“We were in both games the whole
way,” said Massa. “But one or two plays
hurt us. We could have won both games.”

PITT‘ BITS: The next Panther home game
is today against Geneva College, at 3 p.m.
at Trees Field.

The Panthers will travel to Akron
University on Friday for a doubleheader,
then will return for a weekend series
against Providence in another Big East
matchup.

New football league has its merits and SportsCenter rules

So you say you don’t like
football in the spring and summer.
It’s stupid. It’s time for baseball.
It’s not going to work out. No
one will ever watch it.

C’mon, lighten up. Try it. You
might like it.

Before I watched the World
League of American Football, I
also said many of the previous
things. I was skeptical. I thought
it would be stupid, or it would

just showcase a lot of college or
National Football League has-
beens. Well, maybe it has, but it’s
also been very exciting. Quite
enjoyable, I might add. I’m an
avid watcher and supporter, now.

Now don’t get me wrong. The
NFL is still tops with me, but
where else can you see Knights
ﬁghting Dragons (New York—New
Jersey and Barcelona) or Fire and
Thunder (Birmingham and

Bob
Maselli

Orlando)? Now, unless you read
medieval tales or the Bible, you
have to see this stuff in the WLAF.

What really won me over was
the way these guys play. The
aggressiveness is outstanding,

and they’re playing for minimum
pay. It’s pretty unbelievable that
a player in this day and age is
putting his loins on the line for
no more than 30 grand a season.

But to top it all off, I think the

s best thing about the whole league

is the uniforms. Watch the games,
and you’ll know what I mean.
They are something else. Check

out Orlando; they’re the best. I~

their jerseys lime green.

I honestly believe the WLAF
will survive for the simple reason
that it’s going to a market
(overseas) that has already proven
to be successful. It has direct
backing from the NFL (Tex
Schramm, former Dallas Cowboy
owner, and Bill Walsh, former

San Francisco head coach, were ’

involved in the setup), and
because of the low cost of salaries,
it will stay alive. If anyone
remembers the USFL, one reason
it folded was because of the
outrageous salaries.

So if you haven’t caught a game
yet, tune in this week, and see for
yourself. I guarantee by Sunday
night you’ll have a favorite team,
and you’ll want to see more.

Maselli’s madness:

-I’ve been thinking. Should I
buy a Panther football season
ticket? Will it be worth it? Could I
use the 10 bucks for something
else? Should I go face a team that
makes me depressed for three
days after I see it?

I’ve been watching Pitt for the
past 15 years, and I’ve never
been more disappointed in those
years than I’ve been in the last
two. I want some victories.

I guess I’ve been spoiled; I
grew up with Dan Marino and
Tony Dorsett. They brought pride
to this university. I want those
days to return. I want some
excitement, and I want to have
fun watching the games.

-Did you ever sit around your
apartment with your roommates
and watch ESPN’s Sportscenter?
You should try it; it’s fun. Listen
to how your roommates respond
to the telecast. Why, the other
night, my roommate was
watching a segment on pro tennis
player Steffi Graf, and I was in my
room reading. My roommate
didn’t say he thought she was a
terrific player or anything. He
said, “Boy, is she powerful, very
powerful. I wonder what she’s
like in bed.”

-Drop me a line, and let me
know how you feel about the
WLAF and what it’s like to watch
ESPN with your friends. I will
record the results in a future
column.

 Arrivederci, my friends

“Lee has been their .\'o. 1 player
for over a year, so he knows the
top competition,” said Panther
head coach George Dieffenbach.
“It was impressive for Eric to
push him to the tie breaker in the
third set," he said.

“He started to get a little
confidence in the second set, and
he started coming to the net more
and kept me off balance,” Said
Weaver. “In the last set neither of
us were tired, with this cool
weather, so the set stayed close
‘til the end.

“My serve was okay, and I
hung in there, but you really
don’t get much out of a defeat,
whether it is_close or not.”

In the doubles matches, Pitt
swept the events, winning 8-7 in
each. The team of Garrard and

Joel Orth took the first match.

The team of Jeff Campbruster
and James Chronister, a late
addition, also won the set with
steady play. Their opponents
were much less consistent and
suffered through many more
unforced errors. The final doubles
match was cancelled because of
the unusual length of the No. 1
singles match.

“The local teams are not the
type of quality of teams that we
will encounter at the end of the
season,” said Ginder. “However,
we can’t take them lightly or
overlook anyone because you
never know whatmight happen.”

The men’s team returns home
on Saturday for a match against
another crosstown rival, Robert
Morris.

Crew team adds new

boat, ready for season

By John Labriola
Stajf Writer

As warm weather ﬁnally begins
to return to the Pittsburgh area,
the Pitt crew team is beginning to
gear up for the opening of its
spring season this weekend in
Baltimore, Md., with several new
additions to the team.

The team has added a new
eight—man shell to its clock of ﬁve
four-man shells and one two-
man boat. The eight-man shell
will allow the team to compete in
head races, such as last season’s
Head of the Ohio. 3'

The second addition to the
team is an executive staff. The
staff was elected to office in
January, and this will be the first
official race of its term in office.

The new officers are Graham
T urnbull, president; Julie Norris,
vice president; John Evers,
treasurer; and Amy Meier,
secretary.

“We ’ve been practicing six days
a week as normal,” said Turnbull.
“We usually use each of the

Randy Burridge (15 points in last
year’s Bruin Cup run), and Dave
Poulin is once again healthy. The
Bruins have been short on offense
all year but still have maintained

boats."

This weekend the Panthers will
be competing at the second
annual Johns Hopkins
Invitational. There are 15 teams
entered in the race, three of which
are from the Pittsburgh area.
Duquesne University and
Carnegie Mellon will also be
traveling to JHU this weekend.

At the competition there will
be sets of 2,000-meter sprint races
in seven divisions.

The racing divisions are men’s
lightweight, men’s heavyweight,
men’s novice, women’s
lightweight, women’s heavy-
weight, women’s novice and
men’s eight—man.

According to Steve Perry, the
coach of the Johns Hopkins crew
team, the weather for the race
will be dreary with a chance of
rain, but the water conditions
should be favorable for rowing.

“We really have a strong feeling
for this race,” said T urnbull. “Last
year we did real well, Ieven
though] the water was real rough
down there.”

a comfortable lead in the Adams
Division. Hartford has flopped
around all year looking for‘a
trigger man on the power play,
first grabbing Doug Crossman
from the Islanders for 25—goal

and Zarley Zalapski. Meanwhile,
Hartford has gotten worse, and
Johnston got a three—year contract
extension.

You may recall that Hartford
took Boston to seven games in
last year’s Adams semis before
faltering, but Hartford was also
the NHL’s best road team a year
ago and had 12 more points.

But things aren't the same this
time. What did Hartford do to
deserve the wrath of Eddie
Johnston?

Boston in four.

Montreal 39-30-11 vs. Buffalo

31-30-19

Season Series: Montreal 4-2-2

Could it be the year that Les
Habitants get buffaloed in
Buffalo?Maybe, but Buffalo hasn’t
gotten past the semis in seven
years, so why should this year be
any different from all the others?

Last year Buffalo and Montreal
finished third and fourth,
respectively, in overall points in
the NHL, and the Canadiens KO’d
Buffalo in six games in the
playoffs. Both teams are well off
last season’s pace, but both are
still lethal.

Montreal was supposed to be
rebuilding this year, but Coach
Pat Burns has wielded his police

club magically over a young
Canadien defensive group which
is anchored ﬁrmly between the
pipes with Patrick Roy’s
overwhelming presence. But the

young Habs have shown cracks 
of late, winning only three of

their last 10. As always, Montreal
is tough at Le Forum; they’ve got
playoff experience and Roy.

Buffalo, who was overrated
coming into the season and has
underachieved all year, has put
together a late surge led by Dale
Hawerchuk and Alexander “Fly
me to the moon” Mogilny.

Both players are playing
tremendous hockey and have
revitalized the Sabre power play,
which bombed all year without
Phil Housley.

Uwe Krupp has taken the reins
on the point and shown that his
shot sometimes hits harder than
his upper body. Buffalo is knee-
deep in scoring punch, but media
enemy Coach Rick Dudley needs
to send the wake-up call to

everyone for this series, including

goalie Darren Puppa, who will
have to be sickle-sharp. I like it.
