Dr. Wreber Believes
Traﬂic Committee

Wlill Solve Problem

Fcinoval of the two-hour park-
ing restriction on the Mellon In-
stitute side of Fiftli avenue
opened a. \va_v to the solution of
the parking‘ problem, reveals Dr.
John \V(’l)(*l‘, secretary and busi-
ness manager of the University.

Dr. Weber further states t.hat he
is conﬁdent that  solution will be
found when the Better Trafﬁc com-
mittee meets and considers the Uni-
versity's sole property ownership on
one side of Fifth avenue between
Bigelow boulevard and Belleﬁeld
avenue.

It Is a. Joint Problem

For the past 10 years a similar
problem has arisen, Dr. Weber
pointed out, and each year a solu-
tion has been discoverecl.

“it is a joint problem of the Uni.-
ve1‘sit.y and the city,” he claims,
“an .. students must be patient un-
til the committee meets and a solu-
tion is worked out . . £01‘ agita-
tion will not help.”

He points out that the University
is situated in a busy civic center
for which parking areas must ulti-
mately be provided to accommodate
the huge number of cars.

Weber Oﬁers Plan ,

At the suggestion that the Uni-
versity consider buying a 30,000
square foot lot on the corner of
Forbes street and Bigelow boule-
vard, Dr. Weber claims that the
‘fproperty would probably be very
expensive and, if parking fees were
charged to pay off the property, the
tax exemption would be forfeited.

According to Dr. Weber. it would
be cheaper to buy nearby property
and tear down the houses to clear
the lots for a parking area.

A city-built structure, similar to
the one recently constructed across
from l<Iaufmann’s department store
on Diamond street, has been men--
tioned in casual conversations be-
tvceen city officials, he declares, but
no deﬁnite action has been taken.

The traffic oﬂiccrs in charge of
the parking in Schenley plaza be-
came angry Monday.

Angry Police

Temporary no—parking s i g n s,
posted along Bigelow boulevard
near Forbes field, were mysteriously
torn down and cars parked in the
no-parking area.

A traiiic oflicer was seen emphat-
icallv disapproving the removals of
the signs, waving the yellow card-
boards in the faces of bewildered
news boys and expressing his dis-
approval with choice profanity.

Elections which saw fraternities
take 19 positions in the assembly of
the Student Faculty Association, all
offices in the College Association,
and six seats in Men’s Council are
over, and the organizations con-
cerned are settling down to the
election of officers and preparing
for the coming year.

New officers of the men’s group
will be elected at a regular monthly
meeting on Tuesday, May 14. With
the Fraternities in control, an en-
tire slate of Fraternity-sponsored
oﬁﬁcers will be elected.

It is conceded the president for
1940-41 will be Alvin Ludwig,
BA41, Theta Chi. Donald Parke.
C41, Kappa Sigma, will serve as
‘vice president. Secretary of the
council is expected to be Richard
Gardner, C41, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon. Originally slated. for treasurer
but defeated in his attempt at elec-
tion was Henry Nemrod, E42, Sigma
Alpha Mu. No candidate for the
position. has been named by the
Fraternity steering committee.

The first meeting of the new as-
sevnbly of SEA has not as yet been
scheduled. At that time, the as-

sembly will elect six members of
the executive committee. The ex-
ecutive committee, composed of the
six student members and three fac-
UNY members, will. then meet and
choose the ofﬁcers.

Each political group in SFA will
be enabled to elect three members
of the executive committee on the
basis of their representation. The
faculty representatives: Dr. Vincent
W. Lanfear, dean of men; Miss
Thyrsa VV. Amos, dean of women;
and Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men, will then have the de-
ciding votes in the election of of-
ﬁcers.

Fraternity representatives in ex-
ecutive committee will probably be
Joe Roberts, BA41, Phi Gamma Del-
ta: David T. Buente, C41, Delta Tau
Delta; and Gene Pyle, C41, Kappa
Kappa Gamma. Independents have
not as yet decided upon their
choices, but a meeting of party
leaders is scheduled for tomorrow.

Adele Yorio, Ed41, is certain. of
being selected by the steering com-

mittee, and two out of these three .

men are slated: William l\r’IcElw-ain,
C4-1, Fred Robie, Ed~l1, and David
Tucker, C41. 1

Novelty Day to F ealure

Water Fight,

Shoe ‘Race

No steam. calliopes, no bearded women or wild men from Borneo,
but present plans for the Spring Festival Novelty Day call for practically

everything else on May 7.

Political competition between fraternities and independents will be

replaced for a day by a friendly
«water battle. Permission has-been
secured to use the ﬁre hydrants
near Trees gym and ﬁre hoses will
he tupplied by the city of Pitts-
b!u‘gh, according to Bill Sheris,
BA41,

At ﬁve minute intervals the op-
}:iosing team will advance closer to
each other, thus making‘ the stream
of water stronger and enabling the
more rugged team to win.

A pushball game, which is played
\x=ith a large diameter rubber ball,
will bring together teams from the
freshinan and sophomore classes.
The idea of the game is to keep the
ball in the air and propel it forward
the opposing teams goal.

Engineering and Mines students
wi.l.l have an opportunity of using
their “mathematical calculations”
in pulling each other of'‘;' balance in
a tug of war.

Saddle shoes are the ticket: of ad-
mission in a. boys versus girls shoe
race. Team versus team, the ﬁrst
group to get their shoes on and ‘lied
will be the winner.

Especially “goodey” custard pics
are being imported for a custard
pie ﬁght. They will be the same
type as used in various staged cus-
tard pie fights and will try out the

co—chairman.

ants. Who can get hit with the

most custard pies ﬁrst?

Other events scheduled are riding-
a greased pole, hoop race for girls
and a race in which a pillow case, a

Teller Traces
Social \V01°k

Sidney A. Tell-er, director of the
Irene Kautmann settlement, out-
lined the history of settlement
muses for members of a sociology
class Monday.

Speaking to Dr. Elmer’s sociology
class, Mr. Teller traced the begin-
ning of the settlement house from
Toynby hall, established’ 57 years
ago in London, through the Henry
street nursing home in New York
city, and Hull house established in
Chicago by Jane Addams. He dis-
cussed the Kingsley association, the
fzrst house established in Pittsburgh
in 1894, and the second Pittsburgh
hcuse, the Irene Kaufmann settle-
ment.

Mr. Teller distinguished settle-
ment work from other community
relief because workers in the for-
mer must live right in the settle-
ment, and the settlement itself is
non-sectarian. He pointed out the
house’s relation to its neighborhood,
and concluded by distributing
aamphlets explaining the services
of the Irene Kaufmann settlement.

Panther Rejection

Nets 125 Dollars

The loftiness of the Pitt Panth-
vcr“s literary standards was conclu-
sively proved last Monday.

Three months ago, Mel Perring,
erstwhile editor of the Panther, de-
cided to iun a series of stories by
members of the faculty, particular-
ly those of the English department.

Mr. Edwin L. Peterson. author of
the recent “No Life So Happy,” was
approached and asked to write a
story. Mr. Peterson wrote a story.
Mi.ss Perring rejected the story; it
was too long to use in the Panther.

Last Monday word came to Mr.
Peterson that a small publisher in
C‘.hicago, putting out an illustrated
monthly periodical, Esquire by
name, had accepted the story and
shipped Mr. Peterson $125 to defray
mailing and other expenses.

For $125, according to Panther
business manager Jack Hocveler,
you could buy 833 Panthers and
have enough left over to get l\v'ii.ss
Perring a Bromo-Seltzer.

of the University, who are also

The new plan for nomination of‘
alumni trustees would give the
Board a choice from a panel of 30‘.
nominees elected by alumni of the

Inherent in the new plan is the
idea that alumni trustees, once
elected by the Board, could be re-
elected as alumni trustees when
their terms expire. ‘

Alumni Association president
John B. Nicklas, J12, has objected-
to this teaturei of the new plan, V

Edi.tor’s Holiday

By Alvin lﬂalakolf

We heard an American speak the other night.

He was talking about individualism, American indi-
vidualism. And he had several interesting things to say
about this almost forgotten philosophical notion. He
pointed to the fact that American individualism was dif-
ferent from all others, that it was a product of this
country.

He showed how it came into being because the pio-
neers in this country deliberately went to the wilder-
ness to free themselves. They wanted to create an
existence that they alone might order. Planting when
they wanted to plant, hunting when they preferred,
playing or working as they alone decided, helping to
make any decisions for the common good, the American
pioneers were real individualists who ran their own lives

and took orders from no one.

However, things have changed a

An Urban bit since then. Both the wilderness
Industrial and the individualists seem to have
America disappeared. Both have disappear-
ed for the same reason: this coun-
try has become and urban industrial
country.

Now people live in cities and work when they are
able, play when they are able, live when they are able.
They rarely have anything they can call their own.
The American people are no longer the individualists
their forbears were.

.5.’l‘_’here still is freedom of a sort. t is the freedom
that the National Association of Manufacturers is always
crying for, freedom in the economic sphere for those in
possession of economic power. This kind‘ of freedom. is
embodied in an imported “ism” called economic liberal-
ism. t is freedom all right, but it lacks the necessary
concomitant‘ that makes it part of the American indi-
vi_du'alis‘t’.s creed.

' For economic liberalism as practiced in the United
States has been one sided; it provided freedom, but did
not as the real Amercan individualism did, insist upon
responsibility. A

If you went to the wilderness,
back in pioneer times, and got bit-
ten by a snake, you blamed your-
self; you knew the snakes were
there. There was no thought that
the snakes were in league against
you. The responsibility was com-
munal, as well. The pioneer was ready to promote the
general welfare and to provide for the common defense,
in everything he did.

The Thieves
‘ And Robbers
Came

But soon the robbers and the thieves came into the
settlements, and took for themselves this foreign “eco-
nomic liberalism” as a cloak of respectability. And they
became dominant in the country, teaching the young to
believe in their ways. Thus, the country has been
robbed, of many material things but more of the moral
way,of_life,,,which made the American individualist.
There are those who call this loss, the loss of guts.

The speaker said that Americans ought to recapture
the freedom necessary to their individualism, that they
ought to re-gain control over their political, social and
economic life. That could be done, he said, not by going
back to the wilderness, but by aiming for what the pio-
neers aimed for, freedom.

We believe that the speaker knew
what he was talking about, not only

What from sound reason, but from expe-
Dr. Turner rience.
Said

For when Dr. Ralph Turner was
asked after his speech on “The
Meaning of American Individual-
ism” at Community Forum Monday night, what a teach-
er might do to escape domination by financial interests
who sought to control academic freedom, he replied:
“The teacher ought to do what he believes to be right
and to take the consequences. If he hasn’t got the guts
to “do that he doesn’t belong in a classroom.”

Poli-Sci Instructor Discusses
U. 8. War Policies at Conclave

Active military assistance to the
Allies, non-military intervention
under the princinles of internation-
al law, or all intervention short of
war are the three courses which
American policy can follow in the
present European war, Louis John-
ston, instructor in political science,
declared at the annual convention
of the Pennsylvania Political Sci-

ence association in Harrisburg last
week.

These courses of action were dis-
cussed by l\/Ir. Johnston during the
two-day discussion of American
foreign policy and United States
neutrality. His topic at the round-
table was “Inﬂuencing the Outcome
of the European War by Methods
Short of War.” Dr. Benjamin H.
Williams, professor of political sci-
ence, was chairman of the discus-
sion.

Pointing out that an Allied de-
feat “would endanger legitimate
national interests of the United
States, particularly by destroying
the security we enjoy from the ex-
istence of strong and friendly Brit-
ish and French empires,” Mr. John-
ston declared that the only safe
and practicable policy would be
non-military assistance thus insur-
ing an Allied victory and prevent-
ing American involvement.

Dr. Williams, speaking at the first
meeting of the roundtable, portray-
ed the policies of the United. States

during past world wars, tracing
American involvement through
trade trade and ﬁnance, strong
preference for democracy, and the
fear that a great military power
would arise in Europe to threaten
the nations of that continent and
eventually the United States.

For the second discussion, which
dealt with post-war world organ-
ization, Dr. Williams asserted the
conditions of an American partic-
ipation:

“We should participate in any
organization that should be set up
to solve non—political problems;
take part in the solution of polit-
ical problems through internation-
al legislation and mediation; give
our support to the judicial settle-
ment of disputes by joining the
World Court, and accept no obliga-
tions to send expeditionary forces
outside the American hemisphere to
punish aggressors. We might, how-
ever, agree to use economic sanc-
tions and methods short of war to
shut off our resources from ag-
gressor nations.”

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, professor
and head of the political science
department, participated in the dis-
cussion on teaching the basic course
in political science. He described
the set-up of the University polit-
ical. science courses, and explain-
ed the purpose of the small sec-
tions, weekly quizzes, true—false. ex-
aminations, and general methods.

The other evening, nostalgic, I looked through my
prep school yearbook once more. to help recall the days
of detention. “Beat Shadyside.” and forbidden smoking.
Below the thickly dotted rectangle which was my face
and the photographe-r’s background, was Beth.

by Kalwary

As if by accident the ﬁve-dollar a dozen picture-
taker had caught what she wa.s——and wasn’t. Her fea-
tures were regular, too regular, like those of a bad
Greek statue. and her mouth a smear of lip rouge out-
lining a full cupid’s-bow. Her hair was plastered down
in bangs, as though they had been painted on. But her
eyes, outlined, of course. with pencil, gave her away.
What she had probably intended as a coy glance, the
camera showed as a wide-open, bovine stare. It was
pretty, but empty.

And that '\ ias Beth in the life, as I remember. Bright-
ly blond, she was generally considered the best looking
girl in school. “The boys would whistle in a crescendo
as she strolled about the school grounds, arm linked
with one of her girl friends, picked, I thought, because
they were all ugly. Beth was dated by the “big” men,
naturally. They were never troubled by her I. Q., be-
cause it’s the girl the other fellows see you with, not
the brains.

She managed to select soft—touch courses. In my
Caesar class, she used a pony for the first term and
then dropped out the second. “That meanie Mr. Can-
ning is sore at me because I don’t play up to him, and
he’s just making life miserable for me,” she explained.
I helped. her with her English compositions, as others
had done the term before: a pretty girl begging help is
pitiful, like a child’s trying not to cry after falling
down stairs.

Beth’s conversation, which I often heard before and
after class, was always a lisp, interspersed vzitli giggles
and “obs,” of her boy friends. She knew all the catch-
words of the day.

She just couldn’t understand why the boys all liked
her, although I do think she went out of her way a.
little to attract their attention with sweaters and subtler
wiles. At basketball games she sat in the first row,
legs crossed, calling “Yoohoo” to the girls across the
ﬂoor and “Hi boys” to the players.

After four years in prep school, her ambition in life
as listed in the annual was to “drink my fill of Alexan-
ders and marry someone with a framework like Max
Baer.” That was the only part of the yearbook which
she approved. The engraving of herself set her wail-
ing, “Oh, I hate that editor . . this picture doesn’t
look like me at all!” A

She has realized both ambitions, I’m sure. I saw
her put away the Alexanders . . more than her ﬁll,
though. And she is now wearing the fraternity badge
of a muscular Pitt senior, who doesn’t play football or
croon, swim or work on the Panther. But he does re-
semble Max Baer.

Co-education

There are over 3,000 co-eds at Wisconsin.

In a typical year the average girl would have quite
a round of activities to cover. She would have 210
quarts of “coke” to imbibe, and 20 pounds of candy to
ruin her complexion with, not to mention 20 feet of gum
to chew.

Seven and a half days would be squandered in the
movies and 55 days devoted to studies to compensate for
the 99 classes cut.

Preparing for her 80 days of dates, she would sleep
115 days for beauty, spend three days putting her hair
up, and 16 combing it, bathe 90 hours, and zip 1,000
zippers.

She would also turn down 125 dates, receive ﬁve
declarations of tender sentiments, and be the object of
500 kisses (these statistics included several “steadies”),
which transaction would speed the yearly consumption
of six inches of lipstick.

Besides these pursuits, she would spend 13 days
clinging to a telephone. In the chase for the opposite
sex she would annihilate 50 pairs of stockings. absorb
two pounds of cold cream, and buy a quart of “My
Sin” or “Moonlight Madness” perfume.

‘Man Who Isn’t

Editor, The Pitt News:

This is a notation to Common
Sense. Believing that anything
short of strict neutrality will plunge

the U. S. into the European em-.

broglio, I respectfully submit the
following for the Senator*s atten-
tion:
Echo From 1917

“We who are dying salute you

With torn hands dripping red.

We die that they may not recruit

you
To the ranks of the living dead.

“We are the laughing war"r1'.o7's_
Tom from the soil and the plow

Devoid of all sorrow and hope of

Whose only future is NOW!

“We’ve-l crawled thru water-ﬁlled
holes

Thru filth and 7'ed—stained mud

To hear a gasp, give a farewell
clasp

To a buddy’s hand ——‘ bathed in
blood. «

.

“Yes, we -who are dying salute you,
With our last breath wish you well.
But cursed be the man who does

what he can

To send you to meet us——in hell!”

'“ When war drums throb, it is not
the Senator who votes for war that
sends us there. He is merely the
voice of the people. It is the pro-
pagandist, however altruistic his
motives, who is responsible, for it
is he that stirs the sentiment of the
people; sentiment which in the hu-

man being'is ever stronger.,th_an the _, The change has been made so that

THE SPECTATOR.

Student Demands
Spectator’s Name

Editor, The Pitt News:

Who is this person that has ap-
pointed himself critic of certain
Pitt News columnists? To be sure,
I enjoyed reading his recent cen-
sures of the Senator. At last, a
man has come who can quote poe-
try and argue the war situation,
both at the same time.

But is the Spectator a man? Or
is he a woman or some other form.
of beast? Perhaps he’s a secret in-
vestigator for the Dies committee.
He couldn’t possibly be a college
prof who has taken time out from

. ‘writing text. books andidelivering.

lectures to reprimand the two per
cent Liberals or could he?

The Spectator has shown that he
can dish it, but I should like to see
him ﬁght out in the open. - How?
He can do this simply by signing
his own name to future letters in
place of the blank check word,
Spectator. -

Only in this way can Pitt News
readers know w’hb ideserves credit
for the attempt to bring, the great

Juggle l..in,eup

For Teachers

Ziolimwski, Katz Start
At F iist, Third Base

Against Indiana State

Several changes have been in
the lineup of the Pitt nine that
will face the Indiana State
Teachers team on April 27, ac-
cording to baseball. mentor Ralpli
Mitterling.

Two new faces are slated for the
infield in the major part of the
shake-up. At first base newcomer
Lefty Ziolkowski has wrested the
nod from veter-
ans Guy Gua-
d a g n in o a n d
Lefty Drobnuski.
The failure of
Ziolkowski to re-
port earlier for
baseball was
blamed on scho-
lastic trouble.

T h e other
“changeable” po-
sition to be set-
tled for the time
being is third
base. l-Iere Larry _
Katz has been :
given the assignment over his com-
petitcrs.

In the outﬁeld l\'Ii'tterl.ing—l1as de-
cided to juggle only one job, right
field. The other positions, left and
center, will be handled by Frank
Goelz and Al Bush. lvlitterling ap-
parently is undecided as yet as to
the third member of the outer de-
fense.

Pitt’s pitiful pitching situation
was some-wha.t remedied last week
when it was reported that footballer
“‘Big Chief” Ben Kish would pitch.
‘The addition of Kish to the hurling
staff should give‘ l\/Iitterling the a.id
he has been looking for to bolster
his hurlers.

With the addition of Kish, the
‘Panthers now boast. three fairly de-
pendable hurlers. The other two,
Jones and Johnson, showed signs of
good pitching when they performed
for the Panthers on their Southern
trip.

Pitt willbe aided somewhat for
their home opener by the fact that
Duquesfne will meet the Indiana
team the day before. The Panthers
will watch the outcome of this game
closely.

Sun Gives Gridmen
Chance to Practice

Charley Bowser’s Panther foot-
ball squad had their ﬁrst real
workout in nearly a week last Mon-
day when it stopped raining long
enough to allow the boys to get in
a full practice session.

A pouring rain washed out prac-
tice most of last week and kept up
Saturday, so that a scheduled intra-
squad game had to be postponed.

This left Bowser still without a
glimpse of his 1940 club in action,
but a continuance of Monday’s
Weather will ﬁnd the Blue and
Gold elevens opposing each other
this Saturday.

for the match. Captain Joe Kris-
tufek will be the number one man,
but may have some trouble repeat-
ing last year’s win. Lack of prac-
tice and uncertain physical condi-
tion are sure to handicap the vet-
eran star.
Harmuth at No. 2

Frances Harmuth, hold-over from
the 1939 varsity, duels at number
two, and Ed Goehring, another re-
turning regular, will shoot from the
number three spot. I-Iarmuth and
Goehring will team up for the
doubles play. As a tandem during
the last campaign, the two juniors
turned in several impressive Vic-
tories.

Banging the ball at number four,
Dudley Weiss will inaugurate his re-
turn to the varsity after a one-year
lay-off. Senior Bob Martin is
slated to play in the ﬁfth notch,
with Bob Nickeson, former fresh-
man racquet-wielder, serving them
up from number six.

Playoff Places Last Two

A play—oﬁ between Chuck Her-
gcnroeder and Syl Kortz last Mon-
day decided who was to be the sev-
enth player to make the trip. Her-
genroeder trounced Kortz, 8-3, 6-0.

In addition to the duo of I-Iarmuth
and Goehring, the other Pitt doubles
teams will probably be the number
one Weiss-Kristufek two some and
either Nickeson or Martin pairing
with Hergenroeder for the third
tandem outﬁt.-

Richards Plans
Wrestling Meet

Wrestling has been added to the

long list of intramural sports. An

open meeting will be held on May

23», 14, and 15 at Trees Gym. .
Luke Richardson, former Pitt

football and wrestling star and now
on the intramural staff, will be in
charge of the meet. The only re-
quirement for the meet is that those
entering the meet must not have
had varsity college experience.

This is the ﬁrst open wrestling
meet ever held in the University
and, judging from all advance re-
ports, should be an immense suc-
cess. Richards and his aides are
expecting approximately 100 boys
to compete.

There will be eight different
weight classes, ranging from 121
pounds to an unlimited class of 175
pounds and over.

The 175—pound class and the un-
limited class should provide the
main thrills for noted basketball
and football players are expected
to enter. "

Pitt Spiked-Shoe Brigade Defends Titles

this Saturday for the 46th running of the Penn Relays, it will seek to re-
peat its unprecedented 1938 coup Of grabbing f0uI' ﬁ1'5T D1309 t1'0phi€S-

Forty-ﬁve years ago, the University of Pennsylvania started a car-
nival that has grown into the top ranking relay event on the national track

horizon. Four times in 45 years
teams won three championships,
Penn, Columbia, Yale, and the 1938
Panthers.

Panthers First to ‘Win Four

Last year in the 45th running. the
Panthers grabbed the greatest
amount of glory one team ever

Frank Ohl, who whizzed into the
lead as first man in all four events,
will draw the same assignment Sat-
urday. Already he has set up a
mark that will probably never be
approached by running lead-OH on
seven winning combinations in two

The veteran senior, one of the
greatest competitors the sport has
known, has an even more diiﬁcult
task cut out for him, for in the luck
of the draw the Pitt mile sprint
medley and mile foursomes, got the
12th and seventh lanes, respective-
ly. This means about a 20 yard
deficit that Pitt will have to make

up.

Carlson Issues Call for Cage Squad

19410.-41. Basketeers Begin Light Spring Practice Drills

By Phil Lynch .

Though peppery Dr. Carlson puts
little stock in poetry, the chipper
basketball coach has turned Vic-
torian for a time, attaching to Ten-
nyson’s, “‘,. in the spring a
young man’s fancy turns to thoughts
of . . .,” of all things, basketball.

The annual spring session got
under way Monday when cage can-
didates went through the paces of
simple cuts and dribbles, many for
the first time under Carlson’s tute-
lage.

Varsity members need not re-
port for the drills, though many of
them have found it too difficult to
keep away from the hardwoods and
are hanging around the Stadium to
gain the advantage of the light prac-
tice sessions. '

The purpose is to acquaint can-
didates with the routines of a Carl-
son system. Footwork, passing and
dribbling are also stressed. Players
who have played only sandlot bask-
etball feel thatmthe opportunity to
play varsity ball is lost ‘unless they
are subsidizzed. This-, however. is

ing contributions from the fresh-
man ranks are Tay Malarky, Ray
Artman, John Swacus, Ed Masten,
Paul Lohmeyer and Red Silverman.
Main diasablers of this year’s
team were the midwestern squads
whose unerringsshooting and pass-
ing stripped four victories from the
Panthers. Most of the same clubs
appear on the 1940-41 schedule.

As the doctor says, “They were
tough this year. We’ll be a little
tougher than them next year, that’s
all. Last year we assumed that we
would be a good team; this year we
know we’ll be a good team. We’ll
work together.”

We hope so.

Tregoning, a member of three win-
ners in 1939 and Al Ferrara. a baton
wielder and runner in three vic-
torious outﬁts in both 1938 ond 1.939,
veterans Bud Graf and A1 McKee,
and two sparkling sophomore
sprinters, Bill Carter and Hap
Stickel, vie for starting roles.

On Friday they defend the 440
and sprint medley cups, and on Sat-
urday the 880 and mile togas. The
aforementioned world sprint med-
ley record, as well as their carnival
marks of 31:29.9 and 3114.8 respec-
tively, for the latter races, are also
at stake.

A win in the four furlong test
will give the Panthers permanent
possession of the Provost Penna-
man Challenge Cup, their 1938 and
1939 wins giving them two legs on
it. Five niches are necessary to
retire the Mike l\/lurphy Challenge
Cup in the one mile relay. I

Ail: Model Conventioli

The Uni\'ei'si.ty had the outstand-
ing clclegation at the model political
convention sponsored by the liner-
collcgiate Conference on Govern-
rneiit last vveelc-end in Harrisburg.

This was the opening advanced
today by l\«liss Beth Howard, FCW
junior and ICG regional director.

Miss Hoxvard described the local
unit as “a real powerhouse, leading;
the convention not only in determ-
ining the substance of the model
political platiform but in _promotin___c_z
an orderly parliamentary proce-
dure."

Led by Sam Rodgers. C41, the
‘U?‘.‘l\7(il."Sl"[:\-" delegatioii representing;
the state of Texas, stampeded the
opening session when they ‘marchr;-id
on to the convention floor, twenty-
three strong, flashing ten-gallon
lwats and singing “The Eyes of Tex-
as.” They promptly led oil‘ in de-
_lec.ting the “fixed” candidate for
chairtnan, breaking the political
line-up, pushing the insurgent can-
didate into office.

Plenary Session

When the convention went into
plenary session to adopt. the plat-
iorm, Macy ‘Levin’, C<i0, led the dis-
cussion as chairman of the taxation
committee, Esther 1V.larcuson, C41,
pushed through the foreign policy
progirain, with the continual ap-
praisal. and condemnation of any
“irregularity” by Tom Abdo, C40,
and Abe Wolovitz, C40. debate man-
ager.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was
overwhelmingly nominated as pres-
idential candidate, receiving the full
support of the University delega-
tion, although “whiskey drinking,
poker playing, labor baiting, evil
old man, Texas Jack Garner” was
accredited with “no votes from
Texas” in a ﬁfteen. minute de—nom-
"iating speech made by Rodgers.
List of Delegates

Bernard lVIcKenna, graduate as-
assista.nt in political science, at-
tended the conclave as faculty ad-
viser. Dr. Rosalind Eranning, in-
structor, and Alice Rotzche, grad-
uate assistant, were observers at the
