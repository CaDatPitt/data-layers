_Weekly Magazine . . .

By MELVHV ROGOW

Pursuing a rah-rah article
policy that is timely for this
period of the year, the Septem-
ber 25th issue of the Saturday
Evening Post includes a story
entitled “Pigskin Preview” by
Francis Wallace.

Wallace, who has a ﬁne rep-
utation among not too far-see-
ing sport fans for his football
knowledge, due mostly to a serial
story which appeared in the SEP
last year which was supposed to
have taken the lid off subsidiza-
tion and football gambling, seems
very friendly to Pitt, judging by
the article.

Twenty-three times, by actual
count, the University name is
used, and in many other places,
men representing the University
are mentioned. Not only coaches
are referred to: Marshall Goldberg
and Bill Daddio receive special
mention, several others are noted.

Further, Wallace picks Pitt to
ﬁnish as champion of the mythical
East, to share with Minnesota the
mythical national championship,
and to have several men included
on the All-American lists.

Whether Wallace made a spe-
cial attempt to be friendly to the
University, or whether the oft-
mentioned “Pitt” was merely used
«because the football teams here
attract wide attention, is not im-
portant.

Unfortunate Error . . .

It is doubted, however, that the
ﬁrst is entirely the case. Wallace
makes a grave error and an un-
fortunate error, because the mis-
take he makes could have been
cleared before printing. In fact,
Dr. John Sutherland, who is listed
several times as an authority by
the article, had seen the article
before it was published, suggested
that mistakes had been made with
regard to the University, and pro-
posed changes. And not a line was
changed.

Peculiar issue is taken. with
Wallace in one instance. Last
year’s editor of the News, in at-
tempting to clarify the football
situation, included one paragraph,
which was, in point of fact, the
very least of the thesis. A down-
town newspaper, licking its chops,
sailed ‘into the offending phra-
graph and made real capital of it.

Explanations Ignored. . .

The Pitt News, Dr. Sutherland,
interested members of the admin-
istration, and others inte;»..,-sted in
fair play, attempted explanations,
were ﬁrst laughed at, later heard.
But Frank Wallace couldn’t or
wouldn’t hear. And the offending
paragraph is included in the Wal-
lace article as proof that Pitt can't
have amateur football, because
the students don’t want it. Here
is the quoted article:

“Pitt football men, not un-
like men in many other
schools, train ﬁve hours each.
school day for seven months
out of ten and add a few
weeks in summer for good
measure. During these months
they are expected to sleep,
eat, think, talk and act foot-
ball. To ﬁnd time in that
schedule (classes, practice,
meals, etc.) for outside em-
ployment to earn money for
room, board and clothes is im-
possible.”

Dr. Sutherland is bitter about
the inclusion of the quote, “As a
matter of fact, he says, “this spring
we got only 24 days of real‘ prac-
tice, the boys drill something less
than 10 hours each week in the
pre—season work, and about the
same durin.g the football season.
This is probably less time than
any other major football team
spends in practice.

Exaggeration Intended . . .

“To begin with, other Univer-
sities have no afternoon classes,
have enclosures wherein they
may hold dummy practice year
round (this is true particularly
in the Western Conference), or
keep the boys so busy that they
have time for little else. Beach-
ler, former editor of The News,
explained the item to me and
together we attempted to ex-
plain that it was exaggeration
used to make a stronger point.
We thought we had succeeded
until it blossomed forth once
again under Wallace’s facile
pen.»

Subsidization also takes its “al-
ways good for an argument” place
in the Wallace story. Six types of
colleges are portrayed, ranging
from the Simon, Simonpure. of
Johns Hopkins, which “chucks all
traﬁic with money,” to the “shoot
the moon colleges” which go
whole hog in an almost undis-
guised professionalism. It is Dr.
Sutherland’s opinion that “no col-
lege can ﬁt into any pat policy—-
each has its own problem and its
own way of treating that prob-
;lem.’’

Hoover Speaks
011 ‘China
Fights Back’

Inquiry Forum holds a spe-
cial meeting today at 12 :30
o’clock in 8 Cathedral, with
Lyman Hoover, student leader
from Peiping, speaking on
“China Fights Back.”

Former student-secretary of the
Peiping YMCA, Mr. Hoover will
explain,’ the ‘background of the
present undeclared war between
China and Japan, from the Chinese
viewpoint.

Mr. Hoover, a leader in the
formation of study and discussion
groups among Chinese students,
has many acquaintances among the
business and professional men, of
Peiping. He organized the ﬁrst
large-scale employment bureau in?
that city.

SPEAKS CHINESE, ARABIC

In addition to his work with the
students and business men of the
city, the speakerhas become an
authority on the problem of Mo-
hammedans in China. He speaks
Chinese and Arabic ﬂuently.

Before assuming his Peiping post
in 1930, Mr. Hoover was regional
secretary of the YMCA in the
Rocky Mountain area. He is a
graduate -of Butler College and
Yale Divinity School.

On his way to a new position in
Shanghai after a vacation in this
country, Mr. Hoover has been un-
able to leave American because
of the outbreak of hostilities in
China.

Inquiry Forum, which meets
regularly each Monday under
YM-YWCA sponsorship, has been
scheduled for today because Mr.
Hoover was unable to speak at
any other time. Beginning Mon-
day, Inquiry Forum will meet
weekly during the ﬁfth hour, pre-

OFFICIAL STUDENT TRI-WEEKLY PUBLICATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

PrI'TsBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER, 24, 1937

Dramatics Group
Will Reorganize

Cass Schedules
Tryouts

For Next Week

Announcing the entire reor-
ganization of Pitt" Players, Carl
Cass, assistant professor of
English and director of the
dramatic group, today called a
tryout meeting of members for
Monday.

“Instead of ﬂoating along with
a large inactive group, Players
will step out with a compact
working organization,” Mr. Cass
declared. “With the new Foster
Memorial as theater for our plays,
we will make qualiﬁcations for
membership in Players more rig-
orous.”

Oscar Goodstein, C39, Pitt Play- ,

ers’ president, advises all old and
new members to attend the Mon-
day meeting, which is to be held
at 3:30 o’clock in 324 Cathedral.
This meeting will be the ﬁrst of
regular monthly meetings, with
the others probably being held in
Foster Memorial.

STUDENTS MUST APPLY

“All students who desire to
work this year in acting, business,
technical, or publicity staffs of
Players must attend Monday’s
meetings,” warned Goodstein, In
addition, he stressed, newcomers
and old members must register to-
day with Mr. Cass in 2017 Cathe-
dral, if they have not already
done so.

According to Goodstein, an-
nouncement of appointments to
various positions will be made at
Monday’s meeting. He also plans
to reveal a program for the dra-
matists “by which Players through
wider social activities can become
a ranking Univerity organization.”

Expecting the tryouts to be over
by next Thursday, Mr. Cass has
set that day for the beginning of
tests for parts in the ﬁrs-t show.
Mr. Cass has not yet disclosed
the titles of that play, merely say-

ing that he has several plays un-.

der consideration, one of them be-
ing a recent Broadway produc-
tion.

In discussing applications for
Players, Mr. Cass emphasized the
need for women applicants. “Not
that men are not wanted,” he said,
“but here we have twice as many
men as women. Usually the re-
verse is true.”

Radio Star

radio, and Metropolitan opera bar-
itone, will be the ﬁrst artist to ap-

Columnist Scoops
News On ‘Gagazine’

Startled Wednesday were
members of The Pitt News to
learn that Charlie Danver, bat-
tered Post—Gazette newshawk,
had scooped them on their own
beat. -

Source of surprise was dis-
covered that University stu-
dents were editing a new mag-
azine soon. to ﬂood Pitt, Tech
and Duquesne campi. '

Danver’s “Pittsburghesque”
further revealed that editors
of the new monthly, labelled
“The Bird,” were Nick Spanos
and Robert Saffron, already
notorious for their activity in
the University Cap and
Gown; business manager, Sid-
ney Tumpson, younger brother
of former Pitt News business
tycoon, Ellis.

Practically gloating was Dan-
ver as he revealed closely-
guarded names of other Uni-
versity student associates: Sid-
ney Shore, William Murray,
Jackson Sigmon, Peter Math-
ews, Nora Sanderson, and S.
Sidney Kalwary.

News Editor Koeberlein, irate
over staﬁ lethargy, promises
a shakeup.

’ tensive drills

Starting the football season to-
morrow with formations between
the halves of the Ohio Wesleyan
game, the University’s 120-piece

1- marching bandswill be breaking

a precedent of long standing. This
will mark the ﬁrst time in the his-
tory of the band that there has
been a display at a game so early
in the season.

To make this early appearance
possible, the 160 applicants for the
band have been going through in-
during the past
week. On Monday and Tuesday,
two drill sessions were held. A
banquet was served to the 145
men present in the University

cafeteria between the afternoon‘

and evening drills.

Forty freshman men practiced
in special musical and marching
drills during registration week and
25 of the freshmen continued
training over the week-end at
Freshman Camp.

The band is under the direction
of Theodore M. Finney, lecturer
in music appreciation. Drill coach
is Major K. P. Flagg, assistant
professor of military science.
Stephen J. Tracy, Jr., instructor
in mechanical engineering, is drum
coach.

Students who are in charge of
organizing the band are Theodore
Whitaker, C38, student direc-
tor; John Cheffey, C38, drum ma-
jor; William Morse, C38, assistant
drum major; Alfred E. Baumann,
E38, student manager; and Edwin
J. St. Peter, E38, publicity direc-
tor.

News Inaugurates Weekly Poll
With ‘Subsidized Football’ Query

Long the subject of rampant$*

speculation and assumption, stu-

dent opinion at the University on

matters social, economic, political
and moral will become vocal with

' the inauguration of the Pitt News

‘Student Poll next Wednesday on

-the issue of Amateurism vs. Pro-

fessionalism in American colleges
and universities.

Wednesday’s poll will be con-
ducted in pursuance of an article
published this week in a national
weekly -magazine reviewing the
status of important football teams
for the forthcoming season, and
discussing the problem of com-
mercialism.

The poll enterprise, under the
direction of Ray C. Maclntyre,
C38, is being launched in response
to a need long felt on campus that
the student and his opinion should
be less an “unknown quantity.”
Each week some question of public

-signiﬁcance will be submitted to

the student body for an expression

of opinion, and the results print-

ed in. The Pitt News.
Interviewing of students for

Wednesday’s poll, having begun
yesterday, will continue through
today and Monday. Mimeographed
forms with speciﬁc questions re-
quiring an answer of “yes”
“no” are being used. Space is
allowed for brief comment by the
person interviewed.

Answers will be classiﬁed on the
basis of school and sex. Interview-
ing at random "will be continued
until the proportions of students
interviewed in the college, School
of Business Administration, School
of Education, and the ‘School of
Engineering coincide with enroll-
ment percentages of the Registrar’s
office——i. e., there will be no set
number of questionnaires to ﬁll,
as the percentages must work
themselves out. This method will
insure a better cross-section and
a more accurate poll. if

The following questions will be
included in the ﬁrst poll:

1. Do you in general favor
the practice of most universi-
ties‘ of extending to good high
school football players extra in-

or‘

ducements in the form of schol-
arships, exemptions, “jobs,” etc.,
in order to persuade them to at-
tend that particular school?

2. Do you believe athletes
should be paid outright salar-
ies? _

3. Do you believe that a sys-
tematic exploitation of football
at any given university neces-
sarily hampers the development
of, and interest in, a comprehen-
sive recreational program at that
institution?

4. Do you believe that inter-
est in college football would be
as great among the students if
it were kept on a strictly ama-
teur (without organized prosely-
tyzing or subsidizing) basis?

5. Do you believe that inter-
est in college football would be
as great among outsiders if it
were kept on a strictly amateur
(as deﬁned above) basis?

6. Do you think college foot-
ball machines should be main-
tained with an eye to the gate
receipts? I

There are some who say, “No-

game will give some slant on how
the 1937 Pitt football team charges

idown the ﬁeld.

SECOND OF SERIES

Opening Jock Sutherland’s 14th
year as Pitt gridiron coach, the
game tomorrow will be the sec-
ond of a two-year inaugural ser-
ies with the Buckeye team. Last
year the Panthers were set for
what was to be their toughest
opening game in a good many
years. Instead, they jumped to a
quick start and overpowered the
inexperienced Bishop team, 56-0.

This year the Bishops have
vowed it’s going to be different.
They come back with a veteran
team and a great amount of de-
termination to vindicate them-
selves. And they do have a good
record against big time competi-
tion in recent years. They have
scored upsets on Michigan, Syra-
cuse and Michigan State.

PITT FAVORITE

Pitt, completing their pre—sea-
son training with a brief work-out
up at Trees Field today, will come
on to the ﬁeld as a decided favor-
ite, on the strength of what hap-
pened last year. There have only
been three losses by graduation
on the starting Panther ieam.

The lineup as indicated by Dr.
Sutherland today will contain four
new members from that which an-
swered the opening whistle at the
Rose Bowl.

Harold “Curly” Stebbins will
replace Bobby LaRue at right half-
back, a position at which he is not

Health Service
Office Moved

Among other location changes
being made this year is the trans-
fer of the Women’s Student Health
Service, under the direction of
Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, to 825,
Cathedral. Dr. J amison’s office is
the last one to be moved from
Alumni Hall, which will remain
closed for the year.

In its new location, the Student
Health office will include a wait-
ing room; two sleeping rooms;
one for students and one for fac-
ulty members; a room for pro-
posed new equipment; and an of-
ﬁce for Dr. Jamison. Plastering
and decorating in these rooms will
begin soon.

According to Dr. Jamison, there
will be more space in the Health
Service this year to accommodate
students other than those taking
physical education, since physical
education is now an elective sub-
ject.

Panther Predictions

Topic of the day will also be in tomorrow’s
headlines.

Pre-season releases from the Panther prac-
tices ﬁeld atop University hill have had, with
a few minor exceptions, a particularly sooth-
ing air; sports writers the country over pre-
dict that the Panthers will have a stronger
powerhouse than last year; and this week a
national weekly runs a preview of the 1937
football season, placing, in effect, the squad at
the top of the season’s standings.

On the whole, players and student fans are
following the general attitude of the writers:
the 1937 season will be one of the most success-
ful in the history of Pitt football.

One minor cloud is coach Jock Sutherland ’s
skepticism and his pointing out that the squad
is not nearly so far along as it was last year at
this time, and that Pitt opponents Wlll be
pointing for the Panther games more than ever
before.

Generally, this air of skepticism on Jock’s
part is taken with just so many grains of salt
and this year is no exception. But, personally,
we’ll say that the good doctor has Something
there. ,

No doubt the team will live up to general
Panther speciﬁcations, but championship stuff
doesn’t come from pre-season predictions or
the fact that the boys won a Rose Bowl game
last New Year’s.

Our “odds” are even money that, if the Pitt
team places on top of any national season
standings this year, it will probably be on the
major casualty list.

 

Blessings On Thee . . .

In The News today are published 14 commit-
tees of Student Faculty Association whose re-
ports will be given at the ﬁrst regular meet‘-
ing next Tuesday night. _

In the impressive list of the usual commit-
tees to direct social affairs are a number which
merit special attention.

Among these is the Lounge and Lunchroom
Committee set up to investigate possibility of
a lunch room and lounges in the Cathedral.

VVe wait for the report of this committee
with something akin to the desire we’ve had in
recent‘ years for the centralization of classes in
the Cathedral.

The present cafeteria is more inadequate
than ever before. Back in these columns as
early as 1931, the editors of The Pitt‘ Weekly
were praying for its removal to the Cathedral.
Perhaps SFA of 1937 can do something to an-
swer the prayer.

Other committees of note that will report
Tuesday are the Concert Hours and the Forum
Committees, inaugurated late last spring; the
News Reel Committee that met such difﬁculty
the past‘ several years; and the resurrection of
the High School Relations Committee, reorgan-
ized and with a different personnel from last
year.

'l‘o these, particularly, and to the other of
the SEA committees go our hope that their
programs are carried out before next June.

drew W’. Mellon ’s will the other day in front
of the corner drug store where I sometimes
spend a few hours in relaxation. Scanning the
headlines of a’ borrowed paper, one of my
friends, whose-name ‘is Mud, said:

“See, wise guy. ‘Mellon Gives Entire Fortune
To Charity.’ C Maybe he wasn't such a hard-hearted
man after all.”

Now I have been accused of being ‘continually
on the lookout for the sordid, materialistic things
in life. This, some say, is due to my having been
frustrated early in life. At any rate, I proceeded
to point out to Mud that the late ﬁnancier had al-

Well, let us be materialistic.

Now that Mr. Mellon has died, another of the
plutocratic oligarchies carved out in the days of
the “Robber Barons” has entered the honor roll
of foundations subsidizing charities, art, and edu-
cation. I do not blame Andrew Mellon, the man,
for taking advantage of the situation. He was as
much a victim’ of “the system” as the poor suck-
ers who contributed to these fortunes.

Income Not Sacrificed

The Mellon educational and charitable trust has
been endowed with several hundreds of millions of
dollars, the proceeds of which go for advancement
of humane endeavors. Allow me to be mean and
jealous and say that the Mellon clan does not sac-
riﬁce any income by the creation of this trust fund.

It is extremely simple.

The stocks and investments of the trust are nat-
urally placed in Mellon interests: Gulf Oil, Alu-
minum Company, Koppers, Eastern Gas and Fuel
Associates, Union Trust Company, and who knows
how many others. The executors of the trust, who
control these investments, are Me11on’s son, son-in-
law, and tax lawyer.

Thus the family still retains control of these
corporations even while their holdings are tax free.
But that is not all. The Mellon practice has been
to manipulate their properties so as to take profits
from one and present it to another. They usually
preserve the biggest proﬁts for the companies
which they own almost outright, such as Alu-
minum, whose dividends they do not need to share.

At the present time, the government has the
family up on the carpet for just such fenagling.
The charge is that the Mellons diverted all coal
shipments of Koppers to the Virginia Railway, in
which Koppers holds stock. Virginia proﬁts then
are paid back to the Koppers holding company,
thus constituting a rebate and enabling it to under-
sell its competitors.

Company’s Proﬁt Increases

By investing’ the trust’s money in the Virginia
railroad and lowering the rates, the executors
can increase the profits of Koppers at the ex-
pense of the beneficiaries of the will. The same
can be done up and down the lines of their maze
of holding companies, for every one of the cor-
porations sells to each other.

And so a good and great name is created for
posterity. The Guggenheims, the Rockefellers,
and others have gone through the same pro-
cedure. VVhy, John D. at the turn of the century
used to be lampooned in the papers as an ugly
ogre, levying tribute from every family in Amer-
ica which used kerosene.

Editorials denounced him as a “Coal Oil John-
nie” who could squeeze out a million dollars a.
day by adding an extra. penny to the price of
kerosene. But now we have the Rockefeller
Foundation and all that is changed.

I don’t deny that art collections are fine and
aesthetic gifts to give to a grateful public. But
I don’t think Rubens and Titians will be greatly
appreciated by the coal miners who lived an ani-
mal existence on $3 a day to help amass those
millions——or by the girls in the aluminum works
who until recentlymade 35 cents an hour—-or by
the hundreds of men who were forced to the wall
by ruthless competition from Mel1on’s oil empire.

Bureau Of New Plays
Offers Prizes To Students

Students with a serious interest in drama will
have an opportunity to try their talents in the sec-
ond play competition of the Bureau of New Plays,
Sponsored by the seven leading motion-picture com-
panies.

This contest, opening October 1 and closing De-
cember 15, has been established to discover and
encourage playwriting talent for the theater and
to assist authors not only with ﬁnancial aid, but
with criticism and advice.

Awards of 500 dollars each will be made to the
authors of the six best plays submitted in the com-
petition. At the discretion of the Bureau of New
Plays, these awards may be increased to scholar-
ships of $1250, or to fellowships of $1500 to $2500.

If, in the opinion of the judges, material sub-
mitted does not justify the full quota of the awards,
the Bureau will grant only as many as they recom-
mend.

Recipients of scholarships or fellowships are ex-
pected to submit at least two plays within the
year’s tenure of the award, or within six months
thereafter. In case one or both of these plays are
produced, part of the scholarship or fellowship
award will be considered as advance on royalties
and must be returned to the Bureau for the main-
tenance of awards.

Plays must be full—length, original, unpublished,
and unproduced by any professional theater. They
must have the written recommendation of the head
of the English department or his representative.

The panel is composed of leading producers, di-
rectors, educators, actors and critics from which
the committee of judges will be chosen to pass upon
nanuscripts submitted in the second play compe-

b tition.

VVe were reading the text of the late An-I

gifts of about $500,000,000 within the last ten years.‘

Editor, The Pitt News:

Before your columnist, Mr. Mc-
Closkey attempts to evaluate ad-
vances and setbacks suffered by
John Lewis, and the CIO, he
should acquaint himself with the
facts. It is not a matter of the
CIO “overwheming U. S. Steel or
General Motors, or anybody else
-——it was merely that the leaders
of these organizations had a more
sensible and humane attitude as
to their responsibilities to society.
It is only a narrow-minded, big-
oted fool like the illustrious presi-
dent of Republic Steel who must
demonstrate his exhibitionism,
who will continue to throw him-
self against labor, contrary to pub-
lic opinion and common sense.

And who is Mr. McCloskey to

1 say that the Johnstown strike was

a “slipshod” affair, and that or-
ganization had been “superﬁcial?”
Of course, if he takes newspaper
tripe as dogma, it is likely that he
will reach that conclusion; but to

' say this on knowledge is infantile.

If Mr. McCloskey knows any-
thing at all about the CIO he will
know that “careful planning” does
precede every strike that the or-

ganization undertakes, and cer-

tainly the Johnstown strike was
no exception. The great oracle
ventures the opinion that no
movement can arford many such
defeats.” First of all, who says
it was a defeat? Let Mr. Mc-
Closkey examine union records
and see for himself what was lost
-—-certainly not membership.—
William Stark, C38.

Editor, The Pitt News:

This is written after carefully.
considering the “Well—I Think”
column of Wed.

I don’t like to be argumenta-
tive so I’ll start by saying that I
can see some good points in both
views taken toward the Index. We
should respect our professors. We
should be very sparing in criti-
cism that might undermine that
respect and incidentally hurt
some professors sincere in their
efforts toward students.

In spite of this, though, I would
like to congraulate the editors of
the Index. Student opinion could
work wonders. And we do need
the very best professors. In spite
of the fact that some students
probably used it to pick snaps I
think the majority used it to

Excavations Made By Student
Paleontologist With Carnegie

Scientists Dlsproves Theory
By William Colker

“Explorers in vertbrate paleontology need no longer go
West to discover the remains of prehistoric monsters,” states
William Moran, C38, one of a party of scientists for Carnegie
Institute who exploded that geological theory this summer.

By exploring the Tri-State region, they have made sensa-
tional discoveries of fossils of grotesque creatures which made

Western Pennsylvania :1 zoologic-
al habitat in prehistoric time.

“One of the queerest looking an-
imals ever found——an amphibian
with an arrow-shaped skull, we
discovered in a quarry in West
Virginia,” said Moran. “The place
was packed with bones, remains of
fresh water sharks, and lung ﬁsh.”

A huge amphibian, with a skull
about a foot across and teeth as
big as your ﬁngers, was found at
Wind Ridge, Pa., and Cameron, W.
Va. It was ﬁve feet in length,
with a skull the shape of a spade.
The bones were found in a road
cut, embedded in l.imestone.

A rich locality was found
around Blacksville, W. Va., con-
taining skulls and skeletons of a
small reptile which may have
been the stem from which reptiles
and mammals could have arisen.
The young scientist classed it as
a reptile, but it was an in-between
type never found in this region.
The Cotylsaur, which they have
named it, lived more than 218 mil-
lion years ago, and must have
been about a foot in length.

These discoveries have not only

given scientists a better insight
into the early development of ver-
tebrate life, but have shed further
light on evolution.

After working the Tri-State
area, they were surprised to make
a discovery at home—in a brick-
yard quarry on Soho street. It
was similar to the type of big am-
phibian found at Wind Ridge.

It is interesting to note that out
West, every plainsman knows
about fossils, but here in Western
Pennsylvania when people see.
geologists exploring road cuts
they always ask if they are look-
ing for gold.

architect Bohumil Slama, and
chiseled by the sculptor, Professor
Spaniel, of Prague. The plaque
is now in the office of Mrs. Ruth
Crawford Mitchell, adviser on na-
tionality rooms, 1309 Cathedral.

vakia, who died recently, were

Chairman
Appointed

Paul Jennings A
Continues

As Head

At a meeting of Men ’s Coun-
cil Wednesday evening, Paul
Jennings, C38, was reappointed
chairman of the customs pro-
gram to complete arrangements
for the ﬁrst semester project which
has been under way since regis-
-tration week.

October 5 and 7 were set at the
same meeting_as the dates for the
customs examinations. The ex-
amination form for this year will
be similar to last year’s test. To
pass, freshman men must have a
knowledge of three songs, Hail To
Pitt, Panther Song, and the Chant.
They must also know nve cheers,
be acquainted with the history of
the University, know the various
schools and their heads.

PLAQUES AWARDED

After they have passed this test,
their green pins will be exchanged
for gold panther pins stamped
with bliue class numerals. On
November 19, plaques will be
awarded to approximately ten per
cent of the men. These plaques,
polished wood shields holding the
seal of the school in brone, are
awarded to outstanding freshman
men on the basis of scholastic
rating, activities, and general co-
operation with the customs pro-
gram.

Jennings stressed the point that
all freshmen must wear their green
pins until the examinations have
been completed. Upperclass coun-
selors have been instructed to ob-
observe freshmen on the campus
and report those not co-operat-
ing with the plan, since this is
part of the basis for awarding the
plaques.

New Secretary

Mrs. Emmett Barr has been ap-
pointed executive secretary of the
YWCA. She will replace Miss
Helen Battrick, who recently re-
signed to become adviser to women
at the University of Akron.

Mrs. Barr has been connected
with the YWCA since 1921. She
continued her active membership
while attending Bradley college,
in Illinois. After two years at
Northwestern University, where
she worked as assistantipersonnel
director for women, she married.
Mrs. Barr obtained her master’s
degree at Columbia University.
