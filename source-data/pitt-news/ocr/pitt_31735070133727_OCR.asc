Playboy renews itsparty school search

' MELANIE DONAHOO
. Staff Writer

Playboy magazine is looking to make
your weekend parties a little more pro-
ductive.

The magazine recently armounced the
resurrection of its ranking of the top party
colleges in America. Students are encour-
aged to send the magazine their tales of
rowdy campus parties, tailgates_and kegs.
The winning college will be featured in
Playboy’s annual college edition in
October. I '

According to Allison Lundgren, asso-
ciate editor of Playboy, the magazine
chose to hold the contest for the ﬁrst time
since 1987, because of the urban legends
about the magazine’s alleged armual
school rank. '

“Our public relations department gets
a number of calls from students every
week on when we’re going to do another

ranking,” Lundgren said. “So we thought
that it was -in high demand.” ’

representative for Playboy, confirmed that

SIS hosts a
Cathedral
brew ha—ha

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

In a protest against the “poverty
wages” earned by Pitt food services
workers, Pitt’s Students in Solidarity
gave away coffee Wednesday across
from Starbucks Coffee Company on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral of
Learning.

Offering free “fair trade” coffee as an
alternative to Starbucks coffees, SIS
members asked people to sign petitions
for their living wage campaign. 
trade” coffee is coffee that is produced
under “minimally humane conditions,”
according to an SIS ﬂier.

“Living wage for the workers at
Starbucks,” chanted Paul Cooley, co-
chair of SIS’s living wage committee, to
get the attention of the crowd. Workers
across the hallway at the Starbucks
laughed and yelled in support of their
competitors.

Despite several conversations with
Pitt police and administrators, the coffee
giveaway lasted from noon to 5 p.m.,

. when the group announced that its permit .

had run out and members were escorted
away by the Pitt police.

Anthony Faino, an SIS member, said
that the problems were related to confu-
sion about who could issue permission to
groups wishing to table in the busy‘

Cathedral Cafe area.

“No one knew what to do,” ‘Faino
said. “We asked if it was a problem and
[were told that] people do it all the time.”

When asked several times for a per-

‘mit, Faino showed Pitt police ofﬁcers an

e-mail that he had received from a Pitt
official, granting the group permission to
table on the ground ﬂoor of the
Cathedral. A

But University spokesman Robert
Hill said that some student groups are not
allowed to table in the Cathedral.

“Tables for the purpose of handing
out information or dissenting or any of
the activities that characterize the actions
of Students in Solidarity are more appro-
priate for the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union or the

Junk e—mail becoming a fact of life

_ J USTIN MCCLELLAND
Staff Writer

Chn'sMaitlandmaintainstwoe-mailaccounts-—-"

one from Yahoo and one from Pitt, which he checks ﬁve
or six times a day.

“I use my Pitt account to talk to ﬁiends and profes-
sors,” Maitland said. “I never use it to enter online
sweepstakes or mailing lists.” /' I

Yet Maitland,'like many Pitt students, has noticed a
sharp increase in junk e-mail, or spam, on his Pitt e—mail
account.

“I get all kinds of junk,” Maitland said. “Credit card
applications, sniff about trips and cell phones. Just today
I got an oifer for a satellite dish.” '

According to Jinx Walton, Pitt’s director of com-
puter services and systems, the junk e—mail epidemic is
aﬁlicting e—mail users throughout the world.

“I think everyone’s seeing an increase in junk e-
mail,” she said. “Companies are just looking for more
and different ways to advertise their products, and e-
mail is cheap and easily accessible.”

Walton said the spread of junk e—mail is in no way
caused by the University. - '

“Pitt isn’t selling e—mail. lists,” she said. “We never
have sold them and as far as I know we have no inten-
tion of ever selling that information.”

Walton said that many times, hamlless Web surﬁng
can lead to an address being captured and distributed to
businesses. Also, many e-mails come equipped with
links that claim to “unsubscribe” a recipient from a
mailing address.

“If you use that link, it just veriﬁes to a company
that you are a valid e—mail address and then they will sell

Walton said that Pitt is looking for software that can

ﬁlter junk e—mail, but far been unsuccessful."

‘‘A big danger is that your ﬁlter will start to elimi-
nate legitimate e—mail, too,” Walton said.

' . Maitland is concerned about the problems associat-
edwiththis.  

' “Junk e-mails just take up space and can spread
 he said. ‘

Walton said students can safeguard themselves
against viruses spread by junk e—mail in a number of
ways. The easiest is to pick up a free Toolkit CD from a
campus computer lab that comes equipped with virus
ﬁlters for a home computer.

“Software companies typically can ﬁx a virus with-
in a couple of days of its discovery and will send a patch
through the software that updates ’it and protects your
computer against it,” she said. V

Walton also warned against seemingly ﬁiendly e-
mails from unknown sources.

“A lot of the most dangerous viruses have subject
lines like ‘I-Ii’ or ‘Can you check this out for me?”’
Walton said. “And when you open them, they infect
your computer and often send themselves out to other

Walton said that the University isquick to publish
alerts about dangerous viruses that are carried by e-
mails. V

But for now, Maitland and other students must co - i

tinue to wade through clunky advertisements and, ille-
gitimate business ventures scattered among lettersfrom
friends and instructions from professors. If nothing else,
he can take comfort in knowing that Pitte-mail pro-
grams all come complete with a delete button.

CMU gradstudents  
consider unionizing

SARA STILLE

(U-WIRE) PITTSBURGH — Whilestudents at uni-

versities such as Temple, Yale. and Columbia have been"

struggling with their administrations to form teaching
assistant or graduate student unions to fight for better
benefits, Carnegie Mellon University students have
watched and reﬂected on the need for improvements at
CMU. And while Carnegie Mellon studentsihave taken a
much less radical approach to the problem than union-
ization, there are still negotiations» in the works to
improve‘ conditions. . I

In the past, graduate students who teach in connec-

tion with their programs were considered primarily stu— ’

dents and notemployees who may unionize, but recent

government decisions and collegiate resolutions‘ have

provided course and teaching assistants with more labor-
related avenues. ’

Suthcrland’s African heritage  
museum features music, history

SYDNEY BERGMAN
I Staff Writer

Hair braiding, modeling clay and
hip-hop all playa role in Sutherland
Hall’s celebration of Black History
Month. A _

The Sankofa Museum, now located

in the West Programming lounge of"

Sutherland Hall, aims to educate stu-
dents through exhibits about Africa an
the African Diaspora. 1

“Black history is part of American
history,” said Janncl Lee, a senior neu-
roscience and urban studies major, who
serves as a resident adviser at the resi-
dence hall.

Created by Suthcrland’s RAs and
resident director, Clive Pursehousc, the
Sankofa Museum was funded by Pitt’s
Resident Student Association. The
muscum’s multimedia displays include
movies, a colossal map of Africa‘ and
interactive exhibits on traditional
Africanbraiding and art. Students can

try their hands at three- and four-strand V
I braids or mold modeling clay to match

pictures of artwork.

But the exhibits take a more serious 4
turn, detailing the transatlantic slave -

trade and the black civil rights move-
ment. Pictures and articles tell of black
leaders from Sojourner Truth, an aboli-
tionist, to Martin Luther King Jr. and
Malcolm X, an activist and spokesman
for the Nation of Islam who was assas-
sinated in 1965. _ e -
Pursehousc said that the RAS were
sensitive to controversy surrounding
some of the exhibits. “We had to select
our Malcolm X [quotes] very. acutely.”
Further addressing the topic of the

Black Nationalist and Black Power
movements, the museum’s closing cer-
emonies. today will feature Pitt
Professor Liann Tsoukas speaking on
the latter subject at 5:30 p.m.

Other displays include material
about black inﬂuence on American
music. Much of it reads like a who’s
who of modern music, with album cov-
ers of and commentaries on such
groups as Public Enemy, N.W.A. and A
Tribe Called Quest. '

This section traces the history of
black creative expression, covering the
roots of jazz and the blues in the South.
Pursehousc names scat-singer Ella
Fitzgerald and Robert Johnson — con-
sidercd the godfather of Mississippi
blues guitar — as two great inﬂuences
on black music. ‘ 0

The museum also informs visitors
about African history and society. For
instance, in Akan, a vernacular lan-

guage in Ghana, the word “Sankofa”
means “looking back on the past in _

order to change the future.”

Even so, Lee points out that African
culture is quite diverse. Explaining the
inspiration behind the exhibit, she’ said
that another RA expressed concern
about the African Heritage Room in the
Cathedral of Learning. 0

“Africa is a continent, not a coun-
try,” she said. 7‘ .

According to Lee, the museum took
almost a month to piece together and
there have been few visitors. K

Pursehousc agreed, saying, “It’s

tough- to get people? to come to things.”

A The Sankofa Museum is open from ‘ ‘
8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., but the muse- _

um closes today.

schools.” 1 .

Lundgren said the competition is still

in “phase one” and how Playboy will"

choose the top party school has not yet
been determined. Lundgren said the most
mentioned schools might be visited by
Playboy staffers. - ' »

Since’ the announcement of the com-

petition two weeks ago, the magazine has
received an overwhelming response.

“We’ve been really ﬂooded with I

Among the most humorous responses

the magazine has received, Lundgren

cites a drunken message left on her

Florida State University.

1 “They called early inthe morning and

,I don’t know how they got my number,”

Lundgren said. “They said ‘Hey it’s 8

I a.m., we have class at 9 and we’re wast-

ed!’ It was really funny.” . _

' While the winning -college will be
featured in Playboy and may receive an
additional prize, Henncssey and
Lundgren both stress that they are looking

s for a well-rounded college.

“We don’t want just a party school,”
Hennesscy said.‘ “We want a school where
people party hard and study hard as well.”

Lt. Gov. candidate calls on

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Senior Staff Writer

Speaking to members of Pitt’s Student
Democratic Forum last night, candidate for
Lt. Gov. Catherine Baker Knoll reaffirmed
her loyalty to the young people of
Pennsylvania. ‘

“You’re never going to have a closed door
to me,” Knoll said. I

She recounted stories of how she had
helped her young volunteers from the past,
including her mandate that all of them go to
school at night and work on advanced
degrees. ,

“It’s all the work you put into the people
who are with you,” she said.

SDF, the student political group that split’

from the University Democrats last semester,
received Knoll as a part of its mission to help
elect Democratic candidates.

Knoll focused on the state economic
decline, saying that Pennsylvania lost 55,000
jobs last year. '

“All of the beautiful young men and
women I’m looking at tonight — you’re leav-
ing,” she said. ‘

Knoll also praised her experience as state

towers,” Hill said.

Neil Bhaerrnan, an SIS member, said
that disallowing tabling in the Cathedral
was a change in University policy.

“We’ve seen tables down there
before, selling subs and selling cookies,”
Bhaerman said.

Hill said that groups have never been
allowed to table in the Cathedral Cafe.

“[The policy] doesn’t constitute a
change,” Hill said. “They aren’t allowed
to do that.” '

Some SIS members expressed con-
cerns about not having proper documen-
tation of insurance to hand out food or
drink. According to Cooley, no one who
spoke to the group addressed the issue.

“They said there’s no problem,”
Cooley said. “In fact, the police even said
there’s no problem.”

When asked if he had knowledge of

any law that would require SIS to have
insurance to give out coffee, Cooley -said:

goups may table in Cathedral

“No comment.” T
Hill said that the coffee “didn’t help”
SIS’s lack of permission to be in the

Cathedral. But he also said he couldn’t‘

think of a single student ‘organization that
he thought would be allowed to table
there. '

Hill said that SIS was asked to leave
as soon as the proper authorities knew
that the permission issued to the group
was “not ofﬁcial.” He said that he had no
knowledge of when their permit time ran
out, but that groups would not be allowed

- there in the future, as consistent with
University policy.

“[The Cathedral Cafe is] too congest-
ed,” Hill said. -. .

“Fair trade” coffee, described by SIS
in its ﬂier ‘as “an attempt to overcome
unjust and exploitative conditions in the
coffee industry,” was used as an attraction
“in the spirit of social justice — and to let

you know that the workers inside‘

Cathedral Cafe are making less than a liv-
ing wage.” ; ”

This ruling has set a precedent
for several other universities in. the
formation _of graduate student
unions. According to the Temple
University Graduate Students
Association Web site, more than
25,000 graduate employees at 28
separate universities currently have
collective bargaining contracts.

since.

But this may not
be ‘a practical or pre-
ferred solution to grad-
uate issues at CMU.

Graduate Student
Assembly President
Kim Murday‘ said
graduate students here
watched what occurred
in the NYU Case, but
there would be several
problems with forming
a union at CMU. The
largest issue is that
graduate students are
very decentralized.

Murday said one of the largest

issues for graduate students is health" _

insurance. She said the GSA has been
working with Provost.Mark Kamlet

not included in their allowance and

will cost most of their stipend.

“Some graduate students thought

they would be getting insurance and

were surprised-. to find out they,

sidize at least a portion of insurance,

fewer students to do this.

Ruling will inhibit ﬂow of ideas

Mergers are the way of the business
world. America Online bought Netscape.
Philip Morris swallowed Nabisco.
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
has, in recent years, gobbled up many
smaller hospitals. Hewlett Packard wants to
merge with Compaq.

Mergers in the media world just got
easier. Tuesday, a federal appeals court ruled
that the federal government must reconsid-
er its limitations on the number of stations a
network can own, and struck regulations
that prevented cable operators from owning
television stations.

If you thought media giants AOL and
Time Warner joining forces was bad, hold
onto your seat. It’s time for a media consol-
idation frenzy.

It’s time for a crash course in mass
communications. Media are businesses. A
very small portion of the newspaper or mag-
azine you read is paid for by subscriptions.
The larger portion is ﬁmded by advertise-
ments. Additionally, media are corporate
entities with boards of trustees and stock-
holders. The journalists whose work you
read or voices youhear are people with per-
spectives and opinions. They decide what’s
news, what will make the front page and
what won’t make the paper.

What does all this mean? While jour-
nalists in general make every eﬁbrt to be
objective, it matters where you get your
news. From who owns it to who reports it,

the people involved in the process make

decisions that alfect what news you’re get-
ting and how you’re getting it

The more media outlets merge, the
fewer options remain and the harder it will
be for smaller newspapers, television sta-
tions and other sources to compete. The loss
of options will mean a restricted ﬂow of
information.

Imagine the consequences: a smaller
number of corporate entities with old white
men making the decisions for an increas-
ingly smaller number of major media out-
lets.” '

And what about the watchdog role of
the media? VV1th fewer and fewer people
controlling media outlets, the corporate
advertising inﬂuence will rise. IfTed Tumer
owns half of the media world, how much
easier will it_be for him to conceal what his
corporations are doing? And how much eas-
ier will it be for politicians to lobby him to
conceal what they’re doing?

The Telecommunications Act of 1996,
which removed many of the Federal
Communications - Commission’s media
ownership restrictions, was intended to
deregulate the media and to encourage com-
petition. In the relatively few years since its
passage, deregulation has done anything

but. Tuesday’s court ruling will only make ~

these effects worse.

Public discourse requires a variety of
media outlets. It’s time for Congress to
reconsider its position and act to protect
media diversity.

Bikers ruining campus property must be stopped  

Every day, as I walk from my South
Oakland apartment to one of a variety of
campus locations, I ﬁnd myself asking the
same question over and over again.

“What is that large yellow object

between Posvar Hall and
Hilhnan Library?”

I have never claimed to be
an art aﬁcionado, but I think it’s
safe to say that whatever it is, the
large yellow sculpture is a piece
of art '

Even though this piece of
art remains a mystery to most

 

olds —— trying to do these tricks is like watch-
ing the outtakes from an episode of
“Jackass” Most of these guys end up on
their knees and backs more than porn stars.
Day in and day out, these bikers enter
campus, performing stunt
after stunt, and in the process,
min hundreds of dollars of
University property. '

In order to perform a vari-
ety of stunts, these bikers
must “grin ” and ride all over
the marble that is between
Posvar Hall and Hillrnan

and is relatively ignored, I want Mark McCullough Library. In the process, they
to issue a warning that this mon— Columnist tear away and erode the luster
ument is under attack. This and grandeur of the
sculpture, as .well as other pieces of University’s property.

University property, is being destroyed right
in front of our eyes.

Who, you may ask, is the culprit?

The answer: bikers.

When I say bikers, I am not talking
about large, hairy men with beards riding
Harley Davidsons and wearing leather jack-
ets and chaps. I am talking about people rid-
ing normal bicycles who have turned
University property into their own obstacle
course.

Maybe I’m wrong, but I think the X-
Games are over.

No doubt many of you have seen these
bikers using the marble stones and steps
throughout campus to perform tricks and
stunts. Recently, these bikers began toﬁbuild
makeshift ramps to perfonn tricks off the
aforementioned yellow structure.

In all honesty, watching some of these
guys — especially the local 11- and 12-year-

are apparent to any onlooker. These signs
were erected for the expressed purpose of
preventing skateboarders from damaging
University property through their tricks and
stunts. So why does the university allow bik-
ers to inﬂict the same damage on the proper-
ty they have sought to protect from skate-
boarders? A

The stunts and tricks are damaging the
marble in the same way_ that the prohibited
skateboarders did All one has to do is to take

Some may respond that bikers are just
practicing their art, so the University should
just let them enjoy themselves. But, they are

end up costing the rest of us. I do not claim
to be a geologist, but I-am assuming that

marble (or at least, the marble-like surface
around campus) is a little. pricey. -

I do not wish to rid bikers from campus
entirely. I am just suggesting that the
University protect this property as they
should protect all campus areas. University
oﬁicials should place police otﬁcers on duty
to patrol the area being desecrated. Anyone
climbing on top of the panther statue outside
of the William Pitt Union would ﬁnd himself
surrounded by Pitt police. Since the area

- between Posvar and Hillrnan is University

property, it should be protected with the
same vigilance. ' _
I do not know whether theebikers are
students on this campus, but if they are, the
University should attempt to provide alterna-
tive arenas for them to practice their craft.

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Two red-hot basketball teams will
make their way into the sold—out
Fitzgerald Field House tonight as the
No. 10—ranked Pitt Panthers take on
the Rutgers Scarlet Knights.

Rutgers (17-8 overall, 7-5 Big
East) will surely be out for revenge
tonight as Pitt is the lone team to
come away with a win at Rutgers’
Louis Brown Center. .

The Scarlet Knights are winners
of six of their last seven games, which
include victories at Notre Dame and

at home against Miami, Syracuse and 7

Connecticut. A win against Pitt would
give Rutgers an even stronger resume
as the NCAA selection process is on
the horizon.

Rutgers features a young team
that has come together over the past
month. Rutgers has just‘ one senior in
its starting lineup: Rashod Kent, a 6-

rebounds per game. Teammate Ricky
Shields, a freshman, was named Big
East Rookie of the Week as he scored
16 points in the win over Notre Dame
and 17 in the team’s most recent 64-
61 victory over No. 13—ranked Miami.

Pitt (22—4, 10-3) has won seven of
its last eight games, behind the strong
play of Knight, who scored a career-
high 29 points in the team’s win over
West Virginia Saturday.

Knight, who will most likely
compete with Connecticut’s Ca-ron
Butler for Big East Player of the Year,
averages a team—best 15.6 points and
6.8 assists per game.

Pitt’s Jan. 8 win at Rutgers was a
game of wild spurts and physical play
underneath, and the same can be
expected for tonight’s battle.

In the teams’ first meeting, Pitt
followed Rutgers’ opening basket
with an 11-0 run. The teams went
back and forth throughout the opening
half, with play being stopped twice as
Pitt’s Toree Morris and Rutgers’ Kent
had to be separated.

Pitt has work to do after Big East Championships

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

SYRACUSE, N .Y. — Most members of the Panther
track team will probably not look back on the 2002 Big
East Indoor Championships held in Syracuse’s Canier
Dome over the weekend too fondly. _

Both the men and the women had some letdowns
leading to eighth and seventh place ﬁnishes in the team
standings, respectively. The women ﬁnished runner-up
in the meet last year.

But it wasn’t all bad, especially not in the shotput
circle. Freshman Amanda Walker owned the event in her
ﬁrst trip to the meet. ‘

, Walker screamed after her winning toss of 14.91
meters, a school record and NCAA provisional qualiﬁ-
cation.

“I was excited, because it was a [personal best],”
said Walker, who beat out her closest competition by a
few centimeters. “It would’ve been more exciting if my
team won.” _

“All of her throws were good,” head coach Steve
Lewis said. “She had a great series.”

Defending Big East Indoor Field Athlete of the Year
Patrick Harding almost gave Pitt both victories in the
shot, but a Rutgers thrower made it a freshman sweep in

the event. Harding ﬁnished runner-up this time around
with a toss of 17.35 meters. He also ﬁnished seventh in
the weight throw (16.92).

The 800-meter runners for Pitt had their ups and
downs in the dome.

The women half-milers, Janine Jones and Beth
Rocks, followed the same plan that made them success-
ful all year.

Jones went out strong at the start to set a good pace
for the race and Beth Rocks started making her way to
the lead during the last 400.

“If you go out fast and die at the end, at least you can

i still get a fast time,” said Jones, who has already provi-

sionally qualiﬁed for the national championship in the
800. Rocks has an automatic qualiﬁcation.

Jones looked to be in good shape until the last few
meters when Georgetown’s Tyrona Heath burst to the
front and won the -event. Jones ﬁnished second with a
time of 2 minutes, 9.24 seconds and Rocks third
(2209.37). Both times were provisional qualiﬁcations.

JerylW1lbom applied the same strategy as Jones in
the men’s 800. Wilbom led for most of the race but, like
Jones, wasn’t able to hold on in the end and dropped to
seventh (1:58.34). Teammate Jesse Chalfant ﬁnished just

Back to the diamond for healthy Pitt baseball squad

DAN SIGNS
Staff Writer

Coming off an injury-plagued
2001 season, the Pitt baseball team
is healthy and ready to contend in
the Big East in 2002.

Pitt returns 16 letter winners
from a team that posted an overall
record of 18-27 and 6-18 in the Big
East.

“We just need to stay healthy,”
head coach Joe Jordano said. “Our
biggest key is staying healthy. Last
year‘ we were devastated by
injuries.”

With an able-bodied squad,
Jordano and his staff have put an
emphasis on live situations in prac-
tice. They are focusing on what they
deem the core essentials to success
— base running, situational hitting
and preventative maintenance.

The team ‘is strong from both
sides of the plate, which gives it
options. Pitt is capable of fielding a
potent lineup with four or five left-
handers in against a right-hander or
nine righties against a lefty.

Behind the plate, sophomore
Mike Zambriczki and senior Rob
Beahn will see playing time. Both
players have been performing well
in practice, according to Jordano.

First base is home to Pitt’s
biggest bats in senior Brad Rea and
junior Brant Colamarino.

Rea, ‘a preseason all-Big East
selection, batted .295 in 2001, lead-
ing the team in home runs and RBIs
with 12 and 49 respectively.
Colamarino batted .337 with a team-
high 57 hits and 18 doubles.

“We need both bats in the line-
up,” Jordano said. The two figure to
split time between first and desig-
nated hitter.

Junior Scott Folmar, a two-year
returning starter, will see most of
the playing time at second base,
with junior Brad Papciak backing
him up.

The left side of the infield
belongs to sophomore shortstop
Bryan Spamer and senior third base-
man Rolando Bello. As long as they
stay healthy, both can expect to play
every inning of every game.

Bello is coming off a season in
which he hit .302 with 29 RBI.
Spamer started all 45 games for the
Panthers last year and tied for the
team lead with 31 runs scored.

Jordano feels he has his fastest
outfield ever.

Left field finds the return of
junior Stuart Rykaceski, who sat out
the 2001 season with an injury. In

2000, he batted .330 with one home
run and 31 RBI.

“We’re excited about what he
can do on offenseand defense for
us,” Jordanosaid.

Center field is also home to a
returning player. Hampered by a
hamstring injury, senior Tony
Railing batted .339 with eight dou-
bles and one triple in 30 games.

Two pitchers are contesting the
battle for the right field position.
Junior P.J. Hiser and senior Eric
Ackerman both will see playing
time at the position.

Junior Chris Papst will also fight
for time in the outfield. Papst hit
.298 in 41 games last season.

On the mound, senior right-han-
ders Joe Engel and Scott Schultz
lead Pitt. .

Engel, named all—Big East third
team in 2001, led the team with five
wins and a 1.92 ERA. He accumu-
lated 69 strikeouts in 70.1_innings of
work. ‘

Schultz played in only six games
last season before going down with
an arm injury. Before the setback,
he had a 1.90 ERA and a 2-1 record.

Sophomores Don Rhoten and
Jeff Barnyak, who both saw signifi-
cant time on the mound as freshmen,
will also play important roles in

Pitt’s pitching game.

Ackerman and Hiser will also
contribute on the mound, and fresh-
men Jimmy Blue and Mark Rager
are expected to see time as well.
Jordano said the team’s attitude is
tremendous.

For Jordano the objective is
clear. ,

“If we are healthy, our goal is
simple, go to the Big East playoffs,”
he said. “Once: we get into tourna-
ment play, Ilike our chances.”

Making the tourney won’t be
easy. The Big East is one of the
strongest conferences‘-in the nation,
behind baseball powerhouses like
the PAC-10, ACC, SEC and_Big 12.

, Big East foe Notre Dame is
ranked No. 9 in the ESPN/USA
Today coaches? poll. Rutgers,
Virginia Tech. and Seton Hall have
also received votes. 9

“You have to be full-strength 

every weekend,” J ordano said.
“There are no weak teams in the Big
East.” .

After hours of practice, the team
is ready to play some ball.

“We’re excited to get started,”
Jordano said. i

Pitt will see its firstaction of the"

season with three games Sunday and
Monday at Maryland—Eastern Shore.

Tennis team back to the
courts after long break

SHAUN GRIFFIN
Senior Staff Writer

After a long hiatus, the women’s
tennis team begins its second part of
the season tomorrow when it takes
on Mercyhurst at the Oxford
Athletic Center in Monroeville at 2
p.m. a

The last time anyone on the
team participated in college compe-
tition was at the end of October,
when the team finished off a short
but strong fall run.

In about the span of a month, the
women competed in two dual meets

and three tournaments. They won

one out of the two dual meets and
left their marks on the tournaments.
First off was a one-sided 7-2

win at Bloomsburg. In that meet,"

junior Nikki Borza and sophomore
Jill Williams teamed up as Pitt’s No.
1 doubles team, and started off with
an.8-5 win.

Junior Brooke Yablonski and her
partner, sophomore Laura Pegula,
won their match 8-4, -and the duo of
junior Jena Fiore and sophomore
Hayley Hughes completed the
sweep with an 8-5 victory.

Borza, Yablonski, Pegula and
freshman Sydnie Zillig won their
singles matches to seal the victory.

The next event in which the
team competed was the Bucknell
Fall Classic, where Borza made it
all the way to the singles finals in
Flight A —- the most‘ competitive
section of the tournament. In Flight
D, Hughes beat fellow Panther,
freshman Erin Cammarano, in the
championship match. ’

While their doubles perfor-
mance won the Panthers the meet

' against Bloomsburg, doubles did the

women in at Youngstown State,
where they lost 4-5. Pitt did get
some comfort from singles victories

by Williams, Borza, Pegula and ‘

Zillig.
Up next was a trip down the

A road to Morgantown for the West

Virginia University Invitational.
The tandem of Williams and Borza
made it all the way to the doubles
finals of Flight A, having beaten
Duquesne’s No. 1 team as well as

the host’s top rated duo, before_los-
ing to West Virginia’s No. 2 team.

The tournament in Morgantown
was the last action most of the team
saw, but Borza and Williams moved
on to the highly competitive Rolex
Tournament, held at the University
of Pennsylvania. The Tournament
invited only the No. 1 singles play-
er and No. 1 doubles team from
Division I teams.

Williams went up against
Georgetown’s best player, Liora
Gelblum, in the first round of the
top section of the singles tourna-
ment. Gelblum beat her Big East
rival in straight sets 6-1, 6-4.

Soon after, Williams teamed up
with Borza to take on the Virginia
Tech duo of Meredith Vincent and
Carolyn Kramer. Virginia Tech got
the better of the Pitt team winning
the single set match 8-3.

The team went back to work last
month, and head coach George
Dieffenbach said his players are
ready to get back into action. The
singles positions and doubles teams
have staye.d-consistent since the fall.

“They’re well prepared,”
Dieffenbach said of his team.
“They’ve beendrilling a .lot and
conditioning hard.”

Dieffenbach said the team’s

main goals are to get into one of six .

spots in the Big East Tournament
and to have a winning record. Last
year’s team finished 12-12.

He said this weekend’s matches
at home against Mercyhurst and
away at Marshall on Saturday will
be good tests.

“They’ll be pretty strong at the
one, two and three positions, but
they drop off after that,” said
Dieffenbach of Mercyhurst.
“Marshall’s strong one through six.
They’re one of the best teams in the
east. They’ll be tough.”

Remembering the unexpected loss

-I was going to leave

-Staying with the Canadian hockey

team, I leave Mario Lemieux my hip.
Team Canada’s captain was slowed

in the team’s first game and missed the

second one because of soreness. Then

he came back and scored two goals
against the Czechs.

Apparently the Olympics are more
important for Lemieux. He hasn’t
scored a goal for the Penguins since
mid-January. ‘ .

VV1th his days on the ice numbered
and considering all the setbacks the
squeaky joint has caused him, he might
be in need of a new hip sooner than he

leave my conscience. ‘

Gailhaguct has been accused of
pressuring a French figure skating
judge into voting for the Russian pair,

‘ in exchange for the Russian vote for the

some evidence that this is not the first .

ahead in sixth (157.37).

It wasn’t a good race for either run-
ner, and they set out to redeem’ tl1em—
selves in the 3,200-meter relay. Forhis
strong performances throughout the year,
freshman Andrew Zang was rewarded‘
with the leadoff spot in the relay. He‘
stayed with the front pack throughout the

‘race and up until the baton exchange

zone.

“It was OK for the first 700 meters,”
said Zang, who prefers running leadoff,
“but I got myself in a bad situation with
the handoff.” . 8'

gas tank started to run out again down the
last stretch when he handed off to
Chalfant. Chalfant pushed ahead of a few
runners at the end, and the team ﬁnished
third behind two of the better relays in the
country, Villanova and Connecticut.

The women’s 3,200 relay made up of
Trenace Elliot, Jones, Maureen
McCandless and Rocks had similar suc-
cess ﬁnishing in fourth place.

In the sprint» events, Kim Lyles had a

spectacular weekend.
Lyles had a pretty easy time in th
preliminaries of the 60-yard dash and the
200, advancing to the ﬁnals as a high seed
in both. Lyles raced to third place in the
200, missing out on first by less than half
a second. Her time of 24.19 provisionally
qualiﬁes her for nationals. Lyles placed
eighth in the 60 with a time of 7.72.
Maurice Patterson ran the same two
events as Lyles and the senior had his best
time ever in the 60 preliminaries (6.90).
He placed seventh in the ﬁnal (6.96).
“He’s been injured all year,” said

1' Lewis of Patterson, who ﬁnished sixth in
_» .  the 200 (21.92), about halfa second from
Zang and second leg Robert Edgar '

a provisional qualiﬁcation. “It was only
the second time he ran the 60 this year
and he made it to the ﬁnal.”

Patterson also ran the fastest split on

e the sixth place mile relay.

Pentathlete Alvin Jones ﬁnished oﬁ a
solid performance with 3,491 points,
good enough for ﬁfth. Women pentath-
letes Nicole Kelly and Tamara McGi1l
ﬁnished a respective fourth and ﬁfth.

The Panthers now have about a week
and a half to get over the bad perfor-
mances and build on the -good perfor-
mances of the Big East meet before they
head to Boston for the regional champi-
onships, which the women won last year.

Rutgers‘ comes to Field House with
intentions of avenging only home loss

Rutgers preview, page 11

Pitt had lost all momentum and it
looked as though Rutgers was going
to win, but J aron Brown stepped in by
scoring five consecutive points to
give Pitt some cushion and eventually
the win.

Brown, Pitt’s leading rebounder,
led Pitt with 14 points in the win.
Ontario Lett paced Pitt with big bas-
kets in the paint as he scored 11 and
Knight, despite making just four-of-
15 free throws on the night, scored
13.

Though Pitt has struggled mighti-
ly from the free-throw line this sea-
son, Rutgers is one opponent who has
performed worse. While Pitt is con-

necting on just 60 percent from the
charity stripe, Rutgers is hitting just
57.8 percent of its free throws.

Look for Pitt’s top defender,
Julius Page, to be matched up with
Rutgers’ leading scorer, Jerome
Coleman. Coleman is averaging 16.7
points per game as he scored 30
points against Miami. He put up 16 in
the loss to Pitt.

With a win at the Field House,
Rutgers can move ahead of Notre
Dame for third place in the Big East
West division.

Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. It is
the sixth game that Pitt has sold out
this season, the most since the 1987-

. 88 season, when it had nine straight

sellouts at the Field House.
