Pete Gonzalez finishes his l6-yard touchdown run through the USL cletense.

Pitt football wins
Iirst game

Kevin Lilley

Sports Editor

After every spring practice, summer
camp scrimmage and press conference, Pitt
Head Coach Walt’ Harris said the same
thing: His Panthers will run the ball as
much as possible this season,

And for all that time, everyone thought
he meant the running backs.

Quarterback Pete Gonzalez had eight
carries for 73 yards, including one touch-
down, to complement his 212 passing yards
Saturday. ,

And to complement his team’s 45-13
victory over Southwestern Louisiana, in the
coming-out party for the “New Attitude”
Panthers. \

“We teach him to run,” said Harris of
his starting quarterback. ‘Tm not one of
those guys [who says], ‘Always throw the .
ball.’ It’s a great example of a guy that real-
ly went after it.”

Senior tailback Dwayne Schulters led
Pitt with 86 yards on the ground, but it was
Gonzalez’s scramble in the first quarter that
set up the team’s ﬁrst score. After the Ragin’
Cajuns blocked a Grant Coﬁield punt and
kicked a ﬁeld goal three plays later, Pitt
started its second drive of the game on its
35-yard line. '

A pitch to Schulters and a quick
Gonzalez pass to Jake Hoffart put the ball at
midﬁeld. Then, a Panther holding penalty
and an illegal touching call on Pitt guard
Reggie Thomas put the ball back on the Pitt
33. Thomas had turned quickly to make
sure a screen play had developed in the
backﬁeld, only to ﬁnd the ball bouncing into .
his hands.

So, on second and 27, Gonzalez
dropped back to throw. When he couldn’t
ﬁnd an open receiver, he pulled his arm
down and took off as Ragin’ Cajuns began

Pitt pays $3
million for
false accusation

Staff Writer

Dr. Bernard Fisher, a Pitt researcher noted
for revolutionizing the treatment of breast can-
cer in the mid—1980s, has received a multimil-
lion-dollar settlement from Pitt and a written
apology. V

Fisher was suing the University for remov-
ing him as head of a national breast—cancer
study in 1994 after the National Cancer Institute
erroneously accused him of publishing false
data in that study. I

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Friday
that part of the settlement was a grant of $2.75
million to Fisher from Pitt.

After numerous requests, Pitt and Fisher’s
attorneys declined to release the details of the
settlement. Neither of Fisher's attorneys, Robert

J. Ridge and Joseph A. Katarincic, or Pitt's.

lawyer, Thomas W. McGough, Jr., would com-
ment on the money involved.

The settlement was reached on Wednesday,
August 27, just six days before the two sides
were supposed to go before a federal judge.

Local Big Bird goes bye-bye  

Giant Eagle leaves Forbes Avenue location

Corrine LaFata
For The Pitt News

Brent Lind liked the convenience of
the Giant Eagle grocery store in South
Oakland. He could walk a few blocks, get
what he needed and carry it all back with-
out much hassle.

But carrying a couple of bags of gro-
ceries is about to get a whole lot harder for
Lind and other residents of South
Oakland. On Friday, the convenience of a
local grocery store will be gone.

The Giant Eagle on Forbes Avenue
armounced Wednesday that it will close
on Friday, September 5, at 6 p.m. The
closest store of comparable size is the
Giant Eagle on Centre Avenue in North

L Oakland, a 15-minute walk from campus.

This means -that South Oakland resi-
dents, including thousands of Pitt stu-
dents, will be forced to haul their groceries
from one end of Oakland to another.

"I shopped [at the Forbes Avenue
Giant Eagle] because of the convenience.
Now I'll probably walk to North
Oaklan ,” said Lind. “I'm a little mad
about the closing."

The store's owner, Bill Bricker, cited
increasing costs and decreasing sales as

the reason for the closure.

"It was not an easy decision,” he said.
“We had been operating at a loss for some
time," Bricker said.

The store has had problems since
1988, when the corporate store closed. In
1993, the store’s private owner had to sell,
and Bricker has been trying to pull the
store out of financial despair ever since.

But many people are not concerned
with the reason behind the closing. They
are simply shocked or upset by the clo-
sure, and are wondering where they will
shop and how they will transport their
groceries.

Freshman Nick Graczyk said, "I can
see how people with cars will shop, but
for freshmen it will be hard. It's a lot
cheaper at the Giant Eagle than most
places around here."

Students with cars seem unfazed by
the closing, while others say they never
shopped there anyway.

"They have a poor selection, and the
place is dirty," says Julie Word. The
sophomore said she'd rather go to the
Food Gallery in Shadyside.

Dan Bostick, a senior, agreed. He said
he’d rather take the interstate highway all

THE PI'l"l' NEWS

To drink or not to drink:

what's happening Friday   F

Joy Drzewiecki
For The Pltt News

\V1th the ﬁrst week of school behind
them, students were ready to ﬁnd a friend, a
party or both this weekend and make‘ the
ﬁrst Friday of the school year something to
remember.

But there were almost as many different
ways to kick back as there were people
crowding Forbes Avenue looking for some-
thing to do. «

Some said they simply enjoyed hanging
out with ﬁiends, while others tried to get
enough brews down the hatch tojcause a
Saturday morning hangover. Few inter-
viewed said they were looking for a one-
night stand or for drugs. '

Many students who said they would
drink that night appeared to look younger
than 21 but were reluctant to reveal their
ages. Those distributing or hunting for alco-
hol at parties employed a "don't ask, don't
tell” policy when it came to underage drink-
mg.

"There's nothing like partying on a
Friday night. Getting out and drinking  is a
great way to relieve stress from a week's
load of wor " said sophomore Courtney
Smith as she talked to friends gathered in a
circle outside McCormick Hall.

Many other students agreed, saying
alcohol was a good way to take the edge off
the start of a new semester.

"We've heard of several parties, so we
plan on getting really smashed," said sopho-
more Stacy Fitzgerald, Smith's ﬁiend.

The majority of the Friday-night party
hype originates on campus, especially in the
Towers lobby or on the Towers patio.

"People talk about where they are
going, so usually by the end of the night
everyone knows the major gigs," said fresh-
man Eileen Wright.

Several large groups hiked the streets of
South Oakland to hunt for the parties they
heard about at the Towers courtyard.

Dan Wright's apartment on Meyran
Avenue was one of the hotaspots of the
evening, particularly for freshmen. More
than 100 people were inside his home and
lined up outside.

"I accept all kinds of people in my
house," said Wright, while taking a gulp of
Yuengling Lager from his plastic cup.

"Big, small, young, old — it doesn't
matter. It's Friday night — time to throw a
few back, ‘relax, check out the chicks, and
you don't have to wony about waking up
early the next day," Wright said.

Some people said they prefer a more
subdued atmosphere to long lines to the
bathroom and crowded living rooms.

"I normally like to hang out with my
friends at a quieter place, but parties like this
are good ways to get free beer," said Janet
Nagel, a sophomore. "If you're a girl  all
you have to do is bat your eyes and say, ‘But
I don't have any money."'

Eventually the crowd was so large that
Wright feared too many underage drinkers
were present and started allowing only his
friends to enter.

John Darnas, Wright's friend and a ﬁfth-
year‘ student, said he prefers the parties with
large crowds.

"It makes me want to go to college for
ﬁve more years," Darnas said as he surveyed
the scene. "I even get lucky sometimes."

The atmosphere at Darnas’ party was
relatively platonic, though. The two upstairs
bedrooms were empty for most of the
evening.

Another hot spot for underclassmen
was a fraternity party on Ward Street, where
hundreds of students crammed into the
Kappa Sigma house.

Rebekah Kohn, a freshman, left the
party shortly after arriving due to the over-
abundance of people. a

"Parties like that are horrible. Everyone
was yelling and screaming for beer, so I
le " said Kohn. "Freshmen are so imma-
ture, and they travel in packs. Laterl went to
a grad party, and I had the greatest time
because it was smaller and more sociable."

But drinking and partying were not the
only way students relaxed that night. Some
gathered at a hip—hop dance party in the
William Pitt Union, some made their own
ﬁm at the Friday Night Irnprovs, while oth-
ers were satisﬁed just to do their laundry
with friends.

"Tonight our plans will be watching
movies, eating junk food and hanging out
with friends," said Andy Groff as he waited
with his friend, Pam Cullen, for his load of
laundry to ﬁnish in the Towers laundry
room.
"1 have a lot of hard classes, so I felt
tired by the end of the week I don't feel pres-
sured to go out. I'm just going to let it ﬂow,"
said Cullen.

Georgette Champagne, a senior, said
she's tired of the party scene she once
enjoyed as a freshman.

"After awhile, the feeling of having to
party on a Friday night wears off. Now I
usually study, go to dirmer, or hang out with
my friends," she said. Champagne spent

much of the evening at a table in Towers _

lobby enoouraging students to join her soror-

lty.

Others, like Bettina Lee and her ﬁiends,
spent their Friday night at the "Hip Hop
Reggae" party at the William Pitt Union.

"We are healthy students. We choose
not to drink and get wasted because it's
smarter and safer," said Lee, a freshman.

Omolara Olowoyo, a junior who
attended the reggae party, said she refuses to
subject herself to parties populated by drunk
people or smokers.

"I am allergic to smoke and do not pre-
fer to be in the company of those acting
crazy from alcohol. These ﬁmctions let me
get my booty on and have ﬁm with my

friends," Olowoyo said.

Adrianne Elliot, a freshman sipping her
coffee outside the Beehive, said she'll spend
her Friday night relaxing and watching the
nightlife pass by.

"I like this because it's, laid-back, it's
nice outside and I like to watch people," she
said in between drags from a cigarette.

On South Bouquet Street, students of all
ages were huddled in the Pitt Theater to
receive entertainment from the Friday Night
Improvs, where members of the audience
volunteer to improvise comedy sketches.

"I like it here as an alternative from the
party scene. It's fun and relaxing," said
Carrie Carr, an education graduate student,
who preferred to just sit back and watch the
antics of the other comedy members.

Around 2:00 a.m., when the bars
closed, parties began to shut down, and cou-
ples said their goodbyes. Students began to
ﬁlter through the Original Hot Dog Shop
and Prirnanti Brothers to satisfy their late-

rright food cravings.

The "O" was ﬁlled with students trying
to ﬁnd a seat while they carried their boxes
of pizza and heaping trays of fries.

People in Pn'manti's struggled to eat the
famous french fry andcole slaw sandwiches
without any extras dribbling out.

"After a long night of drinking, you
have to put something in your stomac ,"
said Michael McNulty as he shared a large
pizza with his friends after a night at Market
Square.

Jim Magee, a freshman, got his "O"
pizza to go and searched for the friends he
lost track of in the Towers lobby.

"Right now I'd have to describe myself
as ‘tipsy’ and ‘unbalanced.’ But, I had one hell
of a good time tonight," Magee said with a
loud hiccup.

So, as Magee ﬁnally found his ﬁiends,
and as others meandered home, once again
another Friday night was put to bed in
Oakland.

But in his precar days, he would of
necessity shop in South Oakland.

''I bought what I needed there, strictly
boxed or prepackaged food,” said Bostick.
“I didn't want to buy anything that they
had their hands on or touched.”

Cheri Ambersold, a Bruegger's
employee, said she's concerned that peo-
ple who don’t have transportation will
have a hard time getting their groceries.

"Some people don't have a car or are
a little afraid of taking the bus. What are
they supposed to do now? It's along trip to
Squirrel Hill or North Oakland," she said.

Campus shuttles make the commute
to the North Oakland store relatively easy
for students. Also, the North Oakland
location accepts CarnpusFunds.

The closing of the South Oakland
store worries some people living in North
Oakland, too. V

North Oakland resident and Pitt
junior Daniel Morgan said people are
"probably going to crowd the North

The Great “Carl” Caper is
over

Police have arrested Richard
Scalise, the man they say burglar-
ized at least 15 apartments in
Oakland since March. According
to police, when ‘ victims would
catch Scalise in their homes, he
would act confused and pretend to
be looking for a friend — “Carl.”

Scalise used to walk the
streets of Oakland checking for
unlocked apartment doors, accord-
ing to Sgt. Mark Ninehouser of
Pittsburgh’s burglary squad. He
focused primarily on student
apartments, Ninehouser said.

When Scalise would find one
open, the 43-year-old man would
sneak into the apartment and start
riﬂing through the owner’s draw-
ers, eager to steal anything of
value, said Ninehouser. ’

But once inside many of those

unlocked apartments, Scalise
found an unwelcome surprise —
the owner.

”Carl” burglar caught after
15 Oakland break-ins

He came up with a trademark

excuse to’make it look like he was
simply in the wrong apartment.

“When he’d run into someone
he’d say, ‘Oh, I was looking for
Carl,”’ Ninehousersaid. “It was
just a ruse, just a way to justify\his
being there.” Then Scalise would
hurry. from the apartment,
Ninehouser said.

Because Scalise used the
“Carl” excuse at almost every‘
apartment where was caught,
policeiwere able to tie him to
numerous break-ins. ‘ Detective
John Balobeck, of the burglary
squad, said he expects more
charges to follow as word of
Scalise’s capture gets outto stu-
dents.

Balobeck encourages anyone
with information about Scalise to
call the burglary squad at 665-
3771. Scalise is white, 5 feet 8
inches tall, with a medium build,
dark hair and a mustache.

Ninehouser said Scalise physi-
cally attacked only one victim.

“That was when a victim
pulled a gun on [Scalise] and said

World mourns for Princess Diana

A frozen speedometer is the latest clue
to emerge in the death of Princess Diana.

A source close to the investigation in.
Paris says the speedometer was stuck at 121
mph in the wrecked Mercedes that canied
Diana and her companion, Dodi Fayed.

It's not clear whether the reading actu-
ally indicates the car's speed when it
crashed. But witnesses have said the car
was going well over the speed limit of 30
mph.
In addition, judicial sources say the dri-
ver had a blood—alcohol reading of more
than three times the legal limit in France.
The reading works out to more than 0.22
percent, and is similar to an individual
quickly drinking nine shots of whiskey. 1

Princess Diana and Fayed were killed
Sunday morning Paris time when ‘the
Mercedes they were riding in wrecked. The
car was apparently being chased by
paparazzi on motorcycles. The driver was
also killed, and Princess Diana's bodyguard
remains in grave condition, but his injuries
are no longer life threatening.

Photos of the accident are reportedly
being oﬂered around the world for more
than $1 million. Editors at the National
Enquirer have refused to purchase them
and are urging other tabloids to boycott the
photos as well. '

Eyewitnesses say paparazzi surround-
ed the car after the crash, photographing the
injured Diana, Fayed, the driver and the
bodyguard Some said the photographers

even pushed away people who were trying
to help those injured in the crash. Police
have detained the group of photographers
for further questioning.

The princess's only brother is blaming
the media for her death. Lord Charles
Spencer says he always believed the press
would kill Diana, but he says he could not
have imagined that the media would have
"such a direct hand in her death as seems to
be the case."

The body of Princess Diana has been
returned to Britain. Prince Charles and
Diana's two sisters ﬂew to Paris to collect
the body and have brought it back to
London.

Thousands of people have waited in
line for hours to sign a book of condolences
for Princess Diana The line outside of St.
James Palace in London stretched to one

quarter of a mile. -

An American wrote in one of the books

yesterday, "Thank you for the admirable

way in which you chose to use your wealth
and inﬂuence to positively affect the
worl ."

Flags are ﬂying at half-staﬂ across
Britain today as the country struggles to
make sense of the death of its beloved
Princess Diana. World leaders and other
celebrities have expressed their grief over
the death of the princess.

Also, the Office of Research
Integrity accused Fisher of scientif—
ic misconduct by using fraudulent
data in research documents and not
responding quickly enough to accu-
sations that a research team he
oversaw falsified data.

These accusations centered on
the studies of Dr. Roger Poisson, a
Canadian researcher who worked
under Fisher from 1975 until 1991
on 22 case studies. Fisher was
accused of using false data that
Poisson created for the cases. These
charges were dropped in March

1997.

Multiple accusations against
Fisher led Pitt to replace Fisher in
1994 as head of the research pro-
ject.

Fisher began heading the
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast
and Bowel Project in 1967. Over
the years he made strides in breast-
cancer research, discovering that a
lumpectomy, a partial removal of
the breast, was just as beneficial as
a mastectomy, removal of the entire
breast, in the treatment of breast
cancer. He also found that
chemotherapy and hormonal thera-
py would extend the lives of women
with breast cancer.

According to an article in
Friday's Post-Gazette, Fisher will

receive $2.75 million from Pitt and
an additional $300,000 from the
National Cancer Institute in the set-
tlements.

A statement from Pitt
spokesman Ken Service said the
agreement "represents a good-faith
effort" and that "the University has
agreed to serve as the distributor of
a settlement fund established by
various parties."

In a written apology, Pitt
expressed “its sincere regret at any
harm or public embarrassment that
Dr. Fisher sustained which was in
any manner related to the activities
of the University of Pittsburgh.” It
went on to say, “the University
wishes to affirm that at no time was
Dr. Fisher found to have engaged in
any scientific or ethical misconduct
concerning any of his work."

The apology added, "the now
settled litigation reaffirms the
necessity of the University's com-
mitment to fully investigate any
allegations against faculty members
which have the potential to impinge
upon their First Amendment rights
or the essential rights and freedoms
of the academic community."

For Fisher, the agreement
between him and the other parties
finally brings closure to the last few
years.

"I'm pleased and satisfiedthat
the litigation is over. I can continue
my work under favorable condi-
tions," he said. "This supports the
continuation of my work and brings
closure to this loop of events."

‘Stay here while I call the police,”’
Ninehouser said. “And even then,
[Scalise] only pushed him away and
ran out the door.”

Balobeck said the FBI came
across Scalise in an unrelated inves-
tigation and tipped off the city
police as to his whereabouts.

“When the FBI said he may be
our man, we took his picture around
to some victims and they identified
him. So we arrested him,” Balobeck
said.

Ninehouser said Scalise had a
list of prior violations — mostly
drug charges — dating back to 1971.

Scalise was arrested in his home
on Forbes Avenue Thursday and
charged with 11 counts of theft, 11
counts of receiving stolen property
and 15 counts of burglary.

“When the officers who arrested
him brought him in, a different
detective began questioning him,”
Ninehouser said. “When that guy
walked into the room, he put his

Unscientific theories don't
belong in science class

The Moon Area school board (located just outside
Pittsburgh) is, for the second time in three years, trying to
include in its lOth—-grade biology curriculum “creationism”
—- the idea derived from the Bible that the universe was cre-
ated from nothing by God. Putting this in the curriculum for
a biology class, as it aspires to do, is a very bad idea, and we
hope it does not go through. -

The Moon Area school board suggests that teachingstu-
dents creationism as well as evolutionary biology will allow
them to make their own decisions about which theory_is bet-
ter by assessing facts and testing hypotheses.

Biology class should not be about teaching hypotheses; it
should be about teaching theories. In science, the term “theo-
ry” denotes a hypothesis‘ that fulﬁlls two important criteria.
First of all, it must be testable, and second, evidence to sup-
port it must be observable — that is to say, you do not take a
scientiﬁc theory on faith alone.

Now, there is nothing wrong with believing in the cre-
ationist theory of the universe, because one’s personal faith
does not have to be a slave to the scientiﬁc method. But there
is something very wrong with teaching it in a science class.
The creationist belief is not testable, and there is no observ-
able evidence to support it that decries other theories.
Choosing between the two ideas then becomes a matter of
opinion, a matter of faith — that is, it becomes unscientiﬁc.
Thus, even though it may be permissible for a philosophy
class, creationism is not appropriate material for a biology
class.

Even if we go with the reasons that the board suggests for
teaching creationism side-by-side with evolutionary biology,
there is a much bigger ethical problem with teaching students
to choose between those two: They’re not the only two!

To be fair, Moon Area schools would have to teach sev-
eral other hypotheses as well, including the Norse myth that
the nine worlds were created out of the body of a dead giant,
the story from Douglas Adams’ ‘The Hitchhiker’s Guide to
the Galaxy” that the universe was created in “The Big
Sneeze,” and the Hindu myth that none of this is real and that
we are all living the dream of the god Shiva. None of these is
testable, and all are, logically speaking, just as good hypothe-
ses ' as creationism. But, scientiﬁcally speaking, none is as
good as evolutionary biology. . . . .

Affirmative Action is outdated

Michael Berquist
Columnist

_ President Clinton has said that
he wants one of his legacies to be
that race relations improved during
his presidency. He has already done
much to that end His civil-rights
record is noticeably better than that
of his rs. There is some-
thing else, though, thatl feel that the
president could do. Something that
would go a long way toward contin-
uing America’s long jornney toward
racial harmony: end affirmative
action

Aﬂirrnative action has already
doneallitcandotohelpthesocial,
political and economic forumes of
the African-American community,
whose economic situation has never
been better. Economist Peter E
Drucker noted: “In the last ﬁfty
years since the second world war,
the economic position of African-
Americans in America has
improved faster than that of any
other group in American social his-
tory—orinthesocialhistoryofany
country. Three—ﬁfths of America’s
blacks rose into rniddle—class
incomes;,before the second world
war, the ﬁgure was one-twenti .”
As for political power, those who
believe that African-Americans are
powerless are fooling themselves.
About one-tenth of the members of
the United States Congress is

African-American.

While it is true that affirmative-
action prograrns have helped minor-
ity groups that had previously seen
the door of opportunity slammed in
their faces, today these policies do
little more than exacerbate tensions
between whites, blacks, Latinos,
and Asians. White applicants to the

example, were told that they ought
not to even bother taking the. quali-
fying exam because the department
had already hired its quota of whites
for the year.

In 1871, famed abolitionist
Frederick Douglass attacked the
idea of racial quotas, calling them
“absurd as a matter of practice.” He
also derided the idea that African
Americans “should constitute one-
eighth of the poets, statesmen, schol-
ars, authors, and philosophers.”
Douglass noted that these quotas

Wrnightservetokeepupthevery
prejudice, which is so desirable to
banish, by promoting blacks as the
privileged wards of the state.”
Today, aﬂirmative—action propo-
nents seem to have forgotten
Douglass’ words. I was stunned to

read an editorial by an aﬂirmative- ‘

action supporter who asserted that
because money spent by African
Americans accormted for 30 percent
of all movie revenues, then 30 per-
cent of all Oscar nominations should
go to African Americans.
Thatsortofinsistenceonasys-
tem of equality of result over equal-
ity of opportunity is an appallingly
bad idea It does little but reinforce
the hatreds about which Douglass
spoke. In California, for example,
the state’s ethnic guidelines for edu-
cation have had the paradoxical
effect of playing one ethnic group
off against others. African
Americans receive preferential treat-
ment for admissions to state univer-
sities, while Asian Americans have
been discriminated against because
their academic scores are too strong.
At San Francisco’s elite Lowell
High School, Chinese-American
students have been denied entry
because their attendance would
exceed the schoo ’s “ethnic cap.”

The California state legislature
unsuccessfully attempted a few
years ago to set guidelines for
admissions to- and (perhaps most
disturbingly) graduation from state
universities.

Such ideas are inherently
ﬂawed, because instead of helping
open doorsthathaveotherwisebeen
_shut to African Americans, these
policies have done little but close the
doors to other groups such as Asian
Americans. To discrimmate' ' agamst'
an ethnic group for being too suc-
cessful runs contrary to the central
idea behind these policies: to help
remedy the injustices of the present.

One of the largest problems
with aﬂirmative action is that little
support for these policies exists
among the American public. There

was a clearconsensus during the ‘

civil-rights era to end racial discrim-
ination. Since the 1970s, well over
nine out of 10 Americans have
opposed racial discrimination. But
that broad-based support no longer
exists. When asked “Do you believe
thatwheretherehasbeenjobdis—
crimination against blacks in the
past, preference in hiring or promo-
tion should be given" to blacks
today?”, just 33 percent of the
American public said “yes” to this
question,‘ and 53’ ‘percent said “no.”
Seventy-two percent of whites
oppose giving preference to African
Americans in university admissions
or in hiring for jobs. Two-ﬁfths of
African Americans also oppose
these preferences.

The consensus is clear:

For students in the liberal arts, the most prestigious
academic honor is to be elected to Phi Beta Kappa. The
qualifications for election are more stringent than those for
graduation from the College. Students who aspire to this
honor should plan their curricula during their early
undergraduate years so as to meet the requirements for
membership.

 

 
 
  

The Pitt Chapter Of Phi Beta Kappa encourages
undergraduates to grasp this opportunity to achieve an
honor that will be highly important to them throughout their
careers.

Pitt Football,
Part V:  New
Beginning

Triumphant beginnings.
There was the “shot heard ‘round the

 

world” marking the beginning of '

America’s revolution against British
rule.

The happenings ‘at Concord trans-
formed a ﬂedgling colony into a power-
ful country.

And on Saturday, Walt Hanis and
his Panthers took part in a beginning that
one day will be considered the tri-
umphant start of making a three-win-a-
season team into a contender. By ﬁrst
beating and then embarrassing the Rajin’
Cajuns of Southwestern Louisiana 45-
13, the Panthers proved something to
their fans, their critics and themselves.

1 They will not succumb to the tyran-
nical rule of the Big East by the
Syracuses and Miarnis of the world.
They are no longer .a pathetic, Third
World country among superpowers.
They are a rising power, and in the near
future they will overtake the world, or
play in a bowl game.

They proved they are better than last
year’s team in just the first ‘game. They
may have been playing a weaker oppo-
nent. It’s debatable._And the game may
have been closer than the score shows,
Pitt was up only 17-13 at the half. But,
who can deny that this program and its
new attitude will transform Pitt from a
perennial cakewalk into a contender
within a few years?

This team played more strongly as
the game progressed. Last year, Pitt
could only muster together a quarter of
decent play or so and then it was
“kaput.” Against Notre Dame, the game
was scoreless after the first quarter, but
the Irish put up a 40 spot in the second.
Saturday’s game was still in question
heading into the fourth quarter, but the
defense shut out the Cajuns and Pete
Gonzalez and Dwayne Schulters
marched down the ﬁeld for multiple
scores.

Not only did Pitt impress on the
ﬁeld, but they impressed off the turf as
well. The new uniforms may seem Notre
Dame-ish, but isn’t that an okay school
to emulate?

And is an awareness of fans’ needs a
bad thing? In an attempt to make Pitt
games more entertaining and desirable to

An emotion emerged Saturday on the
University of Pittsburgh’s campus that
has not been around for a long time.

Panther Pride.

The Panthers beat the Ragin’ Cajuns
from the University of Southwestern
Louisiana 45-13, but that wasn’t the best

news of the day.

The best news was that the fans came
out and were excited to see their Panthers

play.

The team didn’t disappoint the
34,000+ in attendance, but it wasn’t all
the team’s doing. Athletic Director Steve
Pederson and Head Coach Walt Ham's
have been working" all year to ‘get the
excitement back into Panther football.

“We are just a part of this University.
We are no better than anyone else. When
we win, we all win,” said Harris after the

Men's soccer ties powerhouse Notre Dame

Pat Robertson

Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer
team faced a stiff challenge
Friday night and met it, tying
the Notre Dame Fighting Irish
0-0 at Pitt Stadium.

The Irish were coming
oﬁ a Big East championship
and a Sweet 16 finish in the
NCAA soccer tournament last
season. The Panthers knew
they had their hands full.

The two teams played
120 minutes without a goal by
the finish of the game.
Despite silence from both
offenses, the game was far
from quiet. .

During the game
Pittsburgh received four yel-

low cards and was whistled
for 31 fouls. Notre Dame col-
lected one yellow card along
with 22 fouls. Panthers Matt
Gray, Greg Hoolahan, Drew
Kopp and Brian Baleno
received yellow cards-.

Pitt’s Head Coach Joe
Luxbacher said his team
“expected a physical game.
Notre Dame is a big, strong
team, but this is probably the
most physical game we will
play all year.”  

Pittsburgh dominated the
ﬁrst 20 minutes of the ﬁrst
half until the Irish made a run
which kept the ball on
Pittsburgh’s end until the horn
blew for halftime.

Matt Gray had a chance
to score early, but he could not

catch up to a pass. Ben Garry
missed a cross-ﬁeld header
that would have put the
Panthers ahead.

Later in the half, there
was a scramble in front of the
Notre Dame net. The ball
came out to Spencer Barton
who wound up for a shot but
missed. Kopp and Phil
Matilla had their own chances
early on as well, but both
missed wide left. —

Late in the half, Pitt

defender Keith Blass was

very busy as his team had
some mental lapses. He made
numerous shot-stopping
plays, keeping goalie Chris
Hanlon from any serious trou-
ble.

Luxbacher said the oifem

:L u _—\—.n.<.‘«»%'r‘.rv~!—¢-‘wv ,._-.,. W .- .._..«....-.:- ‘>9’ --.

sive lapse was due to the
“ebbs and ﬂows you have in a
game.” He was pleased that
his team “weathered the
storm.”

Both teams had good
scoring chances in the ﬁrst
half. For example, Notre
Dame had about ﬁve minutes
of constant pressure on the
Panthers but could get notl1-
ing out of these.

The second half was
more of a seesaw battle. Notre
Dame dominated early on, but
for the rest of the half, both
teams went back and forth
with no real dominating force.

According to the oﬂicial
rules of college soccer, the
teams play two 15-minute

to crack the pocket. He passed the
line of scrimmage untouched, and
by the time the USL secondary
came up to make the tackle,
Gonzalez had scrambled for a 31-
yard ﬁrst down.

“I don’t see myself as a
[Donovan] McNabb or any-
thing,” said Gonzalez, alluding to
Syracuse’s option quarterback,
“but the opportunities were
there.” _ ‘

Three plays later, Gonzalez
hooked'up with junior-college
transfer Terry Murphy on a 10-
yard touchdown pass. Murphy
blew by USL sophomore comer-
back Charles Woods into the back
of the end zone, then juggled the
pass a few times before gaining
control of the ﬁrst touchdown of
the contest.

The crowd roared but soon

fell silent as a loud crash echoed _

from the northeast corner of the
stadium -—- ﬁreworks.
Blue-and-yellow streaks shot
into the air after every Pitt touch-
down —- until rookie Kevan
Bar1ow’s one-yard plunge at the
end of the contest, when most of
the fans (and possibly all of the
ﬁreworks) were gone. It was one

of many new features on display
at the game, including the new $1
million PantherVision score-
board, a new navy blue paint job
inside and a carnival-style
PantherFest held outside the sta-
dium before kickoff.

Gonzalez found Murphy
again before the first quarter was
over, this time connecting for a
24-yard score with Woods trailing
far behind his man.

While the USL defense tried
to solve the new West Coast
offense, Pitt’s defense held the
Cajuns to just one touchdown —
a 17-yard pass from Barton Folse
to Mark Buford set up by a
Barlow fumble early in the sec-
ond quarter.

Harris attributed ' the
defense’s success to Defensive
Coordinator Larry Coyer’s mad
dog scheme, and a matching mad
dog attitude.

‘There was some hellacious
hits,” said Harris, “some guys get-
ting wiped out right in front of
me.”

Doing hellacious duty for the
ﬁrst time in the college ranks was
D.J. Dinkins, the ex-quarterback
who became a defensive back
after ﬁnishing third in the presea-
son QB rankings. Dinkins broke

up two passes, nearly intercepting
both, and was happy in his. new
role. »
“We started having fun,” he
said of his team’s aggressive’ play.
“Just killing people.” _

As vicious as Pitt may have
been, the Cajuns wou1dn’t die —
keeping the score at 17-13 well
into the third quarter. Pitt drove
deep into Cajun territory on its
second possession of the half, but
the drive stalled on the USL 28
after two incompletions. S

On third and 10, Gonzalez
was left without an -open man
again. He pulled his arm down,
again. He lowered his head and
stormed out of the pocket, again.
And again, he picked up a crucial
ﬁrst down.

On the next play, he hit_

Hoffart with a 14-yard touch-
down pass and Pitt went ahead,
24-13.

“The game was in question,
and I think our football team took
it,” said Hanis.

Pitt put the game out of ques-
tion with two quick scores to open
the fourth quarter. On the third
play of the quarter — a third and
10 from midﬁeld —— Pitt wideout
Cheo Angel burned Woods for a
34-yardpickup. Gonzalez would

scramble again on the next play,
this time picking up 16 yards and
a touchdown. '

The Cajuns rattled off nine
quick plays in an attempt to close
the gap, but on the tenth play of

the drive Folse hit a wide-open .

Terry Murphy hauls in one of his two touchdown catches._

Tray Crayton —- Panther comer-
back Tray Crayton, that is — in
the numbers on Pitt’s 15-yard
line. Backup quarterback Matt
Lytle then drove the squad 85
yards for the game’s ﬁnal touch-
down.

Pitt women lose to downtown rival Duquesne

Brian Knavish

Staff Wrlter

Getting adjusted to college makes this
time of year one of high anxiety for many
college freshmen.

And considering that Pitt’s women’s
soccer team is composed primarily of
ﬁeshmen, it’s no surprise that nerves ended
up playing a major role in the 1-0 season-
opening loss at Duquesne on Saturday.

“As a team,'I think we were very ner-
vous early on; it was the ﬁrst college game
for many of our girls,” Head Coach Roland
Sturk said. “But as the game went on we
settled in, and in the second half, we really
started to play better.”

This nervousness is an expected side
elfect of a team that is in only its second
year of Division I competition and its ﬁrst
year playing in the Big East, the toughest
soccer conference in the nation.

Sturk feels that the overall inexperi-
ence of his team may have been the decid-
ing factor in the game. Pitt’s 25-player ros-
ter is composed of 15 freshmen (seven of
whom start), nine sophomores, just one
junior and no seniors.

“If we would have played them later in
the season, I’d really like ourchances of
winning,” he said.

The game’s only goal was scored by
Duquesne’s Erin McKane and was assisted
by Kate Matuszewski. The goal came just
seconds after one Duquesne player earned
a red card and was ejected, forcing the

Dukes to play shorthanded for_ the rest of
the game.

“I was coming down the left side and
I passed it to Erin,” Matuszewski
explained. “She had good position, and she
made an awesome shot. She put it in a
place where it was impos-
sible to save.”

Only shots that were
impossible to save got by
freshman goalkeeper
Nicole Bashor, who dove
all over the ﬁeld making _
dramatic saves all game
long.

“She was the No. 1
kid for us; she really
played well,” Sturk said.

She said

on both teams spoke highly of the team’s
improvement from last year, when they
lost to Duquesne 3-0 and went 3-16 over-
all.

“We’ve made a tremendous improve-
ment,” said Beasly, who was the team’s
MVP and leading scorer
last season. “We have a
much better team mental-
ity this season.”

Sturk feels that his
group”has improved a
lot” and “played extreme-
ly well for such an inex-
perienced team”

“The whole game was a “We have bigger ﬁsh to

thought it might end in a “We’re a more important

0-0 tie.” . game for them than they
Her fellow Panther are for us.

players also expressed
their admiration of Bashor’s performance.

“She’s awesome, she’s just so good,”
sophomore defender Kara Kunkle said of
the team’s freshman net—minder.

Bashor downplayed her stellar perfor-
mance and like a true team player, gave the
credit to her teammates.

“Anything I do is a reﬂection of the
team,” she said. “There are 10 other people
out there who deserve credit, too.”

Despite the loss, players and coaches

 O?~tn1fs~(t?ri_i»G*_0‘¢-I.rOBi&"U.‘Qi309:i'_t-.|ns  _ -

“As a team playing in
the Big East, I think our aspirations are
higherthantheirs,andItl1inkthatwill
show with time.”

The Panthers were supposed to take
on Youngstown State last night in Pitt
Stadium, but the Penguins canceled
because they had too many injuries to ﬁeld
ateam.

If the two teams cannot reach a mutu-
al agreement on a makeup date, the

halves of overtime if the game ends in a
tie. It is not sudden death. 3

About four minutes into the first
overtime, Pittsburgh’s offense put pres-
sure on Notre Dame. The Notre Dame
keeper left the net wide open and Matilla
blasted a shot that was kicked’ away by
Irish defender Matt Johnson. Then, Blass
picked up the rebound, but his shot was
denied by Johnsonfs midsection. Finally,
Baleno ﬁred a shot that glanced off
Johnson’s head before the Irish cleared the
ball.

For the remainder of the game, each
team only got off one good shot.

After the game, Luxbacher was very
happy with the performances from his
younger players. Two freshmen made
shots in this match.

“It is a new game coming from high
school, but these guys are adjusting well,”
said the coach.

In the end Pittsburgh outshot the Irish
8-7, and both goalies had spectacular
games. Hanlon, a senior who played
behind fonner Pitt star Adam Spitzer for
most of his career, stepped in well against
Notre Dame, a national powerhouse.

Pittsburgh lost ﬁve players to injury
during the game, but all returned. No one
was seriously injured.

“We could have faltered, but we
played solid soccer,” said Luxbacher.‘ “We
are content, but not happy with this out-

impressive win, sarcasm from skeptics
surrounded me all day long in the press
box. Everything that this team was try-
ing to do and change was in some way
wrong or not good enough for this col-
lection of overweight, never—played—

' sports—in—their—life writers.

The new scoreboard wasn’t big
enough.

“I can’t even read the trivia ques-
tion,” whined one reporter many
decades my senior. “A rrrillion dollars
for that,” remarked another.

Actually, if you were there for the
pregame entrance of the Pitt entourage,
which a ‘sizable number of students
were, it was quite chilling. There was
electricity in the  and it wasn’t just
the static from the rumbling on the green

THE PITT NEWS

carpet.

There was a feeling of uncertainty
and excitement, kind of like when your
parents tell you they’ve got a surprise
for you. Everyone hopes for a car, but
it’s usually just a new Dirt Devil — for
your use only.

It was much the same feeling at that
first glimpse of the team as it blasted out
of the PantherV1sion (the big TV at
north end of the stadium). I was expect-
ing something great, and it was. Harris
stood stern and confident in front of a
gold and blue hoard. As the team begin
its march toward the ﬁeld, the crowd
cheered and that ever%familiar “Let’s get
really excited because our team is going
to win” music bumped through the air.

The music needs a change. At least

one team already uses it — Da Bulls.

But, besides the music selection, the

pregame was phenomenal. When the
team reached the ﬁeld, carmons went off
and the fans erupted with an enthusiasm
not heard in these parts for several years.

The enthusiasm boiled over into the
postgame hoopla as the 1-0 Pittsburgh
Panthers moved over to the stands and
began shouting along with the fans,
“BEAT PENN STATE!”

. This team isn’t as good as it looked
on Saturday, and it isn’t as bad as Penn
State will make it look this weekend.
However, no matter what the Panthers’
record is this year, Pitt fans should bask
in this program’s turnaround and
promising future.

SPIRIT

painted in the University’s new colors and
ﬂags featuring retired football numbers
ﬂew over the east side of the stadium.

The most noticeable difference was
the PantherVision scoreboard video
screen. The pregame festivities included
interviews with Harris and Pederson on
the screen. The festivities ended with a vir-
tual journey leading PantherV1sion view-
ers through a virtual-reality landscape
complete with an animated Panther.

The journey ended in Pitt Stadium at
the front door of the Panther locker room.
When the door opened, the screen
switched to live footage.

Fans watched as the Panthers, led by
Harris, walked silently to the locker room
exit. This sent the crowd into a frenzy at
the opening kickoff —- something that has-
n’t happened since the Backyard Brawl
one year ago.

During the course of the game,
Pederson ventured into uncharted territory
— the student section of the stands —— to
shake hands and see that everyone was
having a good time.

The Pitt band —— the group formerly in
charge of cheering —— led the crowd’s
chants from their new spot in the north—
west corner of the stadium. After the con-
test, Hanis brought his team over to the
band and the remaining fans to salute them
for a job well done that day.

The football team raised its shiny,
Vegas—gold helmets to the stands in a
salute as the fans returned the sentiment
with a chant of “Beat Penn State! Beat
Penn State!”

“I’m a big rah—rah guy,” Harris said. “I
am a big tearn—spirit guy. I am a big
University spirit guy. We ran to the band
and the fans to humble ourselves to them.”

After the game, Harris received the
game ball from his seniors, which he said
he accepted on behalf of “Chancellor
Nordenberg, Steve Pederson, my staff, the
band-, the dance team, the cheerleaders and
of course, the 34,802 people who came to
today’s game.”
