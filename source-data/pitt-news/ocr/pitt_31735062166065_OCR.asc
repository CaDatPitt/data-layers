Construction Dispute Settled, Workers Back

No Details Revealed

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS -
The jurisdictional dispute between the members of Local

No. 5 ofrthe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers-

and members of Local No. 12, Sheet Metal Workers, as .to
who would unload, uncrate, and install electrical equipment
in the common cafeteria of the new men’s dorms was settled
Monday after a month’s haggling.

The dispute arose when Ty-

' son Metal Products Co. allegedly
in-*

used sheet metal workers
stead. of electrical workers to

handle electrical equipment in the
kitchen. Consequently, the elec-

trical workers shut off the lights
in the cafeteria forcing the metal
workers to carry lanterns and

- ﬂashlights.

However, the foreman of the
IBEW declined direct comment
on the dispute. “What really
happened was,” he said, “that a
line blew up and shut off the
electricity . that’s all . .
We're one big happy family now.”
Turning to his workmenihe de-
mandingly informed them, “no
comment.”

Capt. Liles W. Creighton, as-
sistant director of the Physical
Plant at the University com-
mented. “tempers ﬂared one
day. as will happen anywhere,
but the conflict was resolved
quickly.” ' .

The union’s business agents
could not solve the problem 10-
cally. The international represen-
tatives encountered similar dif-
ﬁculties. Finally the situation was
referred to th e International
Board for labor’s jurisdictional
disputes by the National Labor
Relations Board in Washington.
According to Capt. Creighton, this
International Board had the prob-
lem for four weeks with no con-
crete results.

Finally, through the help of
the general contractors, Dick
Corporation, the disagreement
was settled late Sunday after-
noon. Dorsey Dick, secretary of
the Dick Corp., revealed the an-

ID Cards Mandatory

SG Worliing on Cheaper All-Purpose Cards

Meanwhile,‘ Student Govern-

ment is working on a plan to re-
place student invoices by an all-
purpose, university-wide, plastic
ID card that would make the Ath-
letic Department’s plan unneces-
sary.
Stop Misuse

“We don’t really care who han-
dles the cards,” Carver comment-
ed. “We only want to cut down
misuse of the studentinvoices for
admission to football and basket-
ball games and Trees Hall.” Car-
ver, citing lending and selling of

A invoices for admission to the

games as examples of misuse, ob-
served “A large percentage of
people viewing the games from
the student section are deﬁnitely
not stu_ ents.”

The proposed Student Gov-
ernment proJect would elimi-
nate this problem equally well
and would also provide the only
identiﬁcation necessary for any
facet of the University, accord-
ing to Carrol Smith, SG vice-
president. “
The plastic card with the stu-
dent's photograph and number,
more durable than a paper card,
would facilitate cashing of checks,

SU Hosts New ‘Gidget’ Team  

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Cindy Carole, 18, is the slender,
blond-haired star of the movie
Gidget Goes to Rome which opens
today at 69 theaters in the area.
She appeared in the Student
Union Lounge with producer
Jerry Bressler at 3 p.m. for a
question and answer session. Al-
though the students, mostly male,
came to see the young starlet,
most of the questions were di-
rected to Mr. Bressler.

Many students wondered _why
the movie’s world premiere is in
Pittsburgh in 69 movie theaters,
rather than one or two major the-
aters. Bressler explained that
Pittsburgh is the best place for
the movie to open.

“We chose Pittsburgh because
the other two Gidget movies were
so successful here,” he said. “In
fact, Gidget Goes Hawaiian, was

STAR OF THE SHOW Cindy Carole did very little talking her--

self. Jerry Bressler, producer of the new “Gidget” series answered
most of the questions and explained any remarks made by the’

young actress. They were in SU on .Monday._. '

 

  

¢ Dr. Noll, an associate professor
of microbiology, and his two com-
panions, Dr. Henry Finck, as-‘ ‘
sistant professor of anatomy, and
Dr. J. V. Hallum, ‘researcher in
microbiology, participated in the
demonstration with Homestead
resident, Clemmie Stubbs, who
claimed he had made a numbers
buy at the shop earlier. ,

“We demonstrated,” Dr. Noll
said, -“because we believe illegal
gambling and clean government.
to be incompatible.” According to
Dr. Finck, pay-offs and‘graft as-
sociated with illegal gambling
subvert the proper functioning not
only of the police force, but of
the local, state, and even national
government as well. '

Circulate Petition

The three professors have been
circulating a petition addressed to
Governor Scranton "among their
colleagues for signatures. The
petition asks Scranton‘ to investi.
gate corruption in Allegheny
County. It charges that the treat-
ment of the case of the ten “rebel"
-county patrolmen, who claim to be
able to expose corruption in the
county government, “violates all
principles of justice and sound
government.”

The existence, not only of
illegal gambling, but also of “ae;
cay of the public streets,” and
“outrageous conditions of the
public buildings,” are indicative,
in Dr. Noll’s view, of either
“grossly incompetent. or crimin- _.
ally corrupt” government.

“If the streets of a Swiss com-
munity were in the condition "of
Pittsburgh streets," Dr. Noll re-
marked, “the managers of the
city would be ﬁred and locked up.
Why do citizens here allow such
conditions?" “

People Indifferent

Dr. Noll later answered his own‘
question in stating, “This is only '
possible if people are . indifferent A‘ 1:

A Dangerous Precedent

 

The ID Question

  

It appears that the nine months struggle over identiﬁ-
cation cards to be used for admittance to all University ath-
letic events is ﬁnally being brought to a head through the
efforts of Frank Carver, head of the athletic department, and
our summer Student Government.

Admittedly, the situation existing up at the stadium

A during the football season and at the ﬁeld house and Trees
Pool during other times of the year is not the best that the
Athletic Department could hope for.

Many students — usually not from the University —
are using invoices borrowed from registered students to
enter free and illegally, athletic events, and to sit in sec-
tions especially reserved for the fee paying members of
this institution. >

Most students feel that they have paid for the priv-
iliges. of free admittance through their activities fee, and
that if they choose not to make use of their invoice then it

, is perfectly permissible to loan it to someone else. Un-
fortunately for the student case, this contention holds little
water when placed up against the acts. ,

We have been assured repeatedly by members of the
athletic department that although they do not know exactly
where the so—called activities fee goes, it most certainly
does not go to provide free seats at .football games.

Therefore, any person who illegally enters an athletic
event on a borrowed invoice is depriving a ﬁnancially—in-

secure athletic department of the money from the sale of

‘one ticket. Multiplied by ﬁve thousand, the amount lost
runs into a staggering sum.

The need for a more positive method of identiﬁcation at
athletic events is, therefore, not a radical nor an unfair
proposal, yet it should be realized by the administration

j” A that this need is not restricted to athletic events but that

ID cards could also be used at the library and for cashing
checks. The invoice is an out-of-date method of identiﬁca-
.tion and should be replaced by the plastic coated cards
suggested" by SG. . ' .

Carver is apparently in favor of turning over the project
to SG just to get the job done. No oneis going to make any
money by the one dollar fee for printing the card. Carver
is worried about his revenue and SG is worried about the
students.

Ideally, the University should foot the entire bill of
supplying the cards to students, but if the administration
is not willing to go this far; it should at the very least permit
SG to provide the student body with an identiﬁcation card
which can be used for more than a pass to a football game.

Vigilance Committee

A policeman ceases to be a policeman when
he takes off his uniform. The ten county police-
men who conducted unauthorized raids on gam-
bling dens in Allegheny County Ire no exception.

Off duty they have no more
authority than any private
citizen.

The unauthorized raids on
gambling dens represent a
precedent that is dangerous in
a free democratic republic.
The type of action the ten
policemen carried out is not so
different from the raids car-
ried out by Hitler’s Third Reich
Gestapo. The only difference
between the two is that the
Nazi force was authorized.

The ‘ten raiders are also no different than the
vigilantes and vigilance committees of the Old
West. These men, like the ten raiders, rode
throughithe night preserving “law .and order.”
Most of these committees became nothing more
than mobs shortly after their establishment. Many
innocent people were hanged as a result of these
raids to preserve “law and order.’j

Unsafe Homes

The ten modern day v_igilantes were successful
in their first raids, but that is not _what is in
question here. What if they would have raided
a house and found nothing? Someone’s privacy,
and their right to the same would have been

broken any laws breaking into a private home
where they suspected gambling. They would have‘

the right to break into any home where they
suspected illegal doings. Our homes are no longer

safe if these men are allowed to conduct these.

unauthorized raids.

The issue here is the public’s right to privacy.

Some people seem to think that policemen are
capable of enforcing the law on their own at any
time of the day, and that they should have the
right to use their own discretion in matters con-
cerning law enforcement.

No_ one is capable of enforcing the law on his
own, whether he be a policeman or a truck driver.

Military Discipline

A police force is a military organization. The

only way such an organization can be run is by

strict discipline. This means the policemen should

have "deﬁnite orders which must not be violated. a

Giving a law enforcement oﬂicer discretionary
rights is to make him a vigilante, and a threat
to our privacy.

Furthermore, the policeman is only paid to
work an eight hour day. When he takes off his
uniform, he ceases tobe a law enforcement offi-
cer. Lawbreakers may not recognize work shi-fts,
but policemen must, for reasons already stated.

It is more dangerous to pat the ten policemen
on the back and tell them they've done a good
job than it is to publicly castigate them. _What
these ‘men did constitutes a deﬁnite threat to ou

But, what if these men were authorized to

The ten raiders should be severely repri-

Senior Raps
Graduation Fee

To the Editor:

The University has done it
again! I've kept my mouthpshut
four years concerning the vari-
ous fees the University charges
the student, which, in my mind
appear to be nonsensical. I’m

_ sure that many of the students

are aware of the many that exist.
‘ My most recent (and I hope
the last) fee that I have been
charged for is the University of
Pittsburgh Graduation Fee. Upon.
inquiry at the office of Student
Records, I was informed that
this fee covers the cost of grad-
uation expenses spent by the
University. I inquired as to the
specific expense(s) that gradu-
ation requires. I was then in-
formed that this fee covers the

. cost of closing the student’s ﬁles

‘and in addition pays for the
transcript that is sent to the
graduating senior. $30! Really!

Library Policy
Unsatistacrory

To the Editor:

.My bone to crunch is the li-
brary’s policy of not permitting
photostatic copies to circulate
overnight. -To me it is a grossly
irrational policy, and further-
more extremely unjust in refer-
ence to the University fee which
we pay for precisely such _privi-
leges.

This read-it-here policy. is
highly irrational. Why does the
library permit “reserve” books
to circulate at night——books

which have only one or two -
copies—and then abstain from-

letting one of the 6 or 7 photo-
staticcopies out? Does 10c a
page cost the more?

As to the condition of the
copy, it seems to me that if cir-
culated in a manila envelope, no
drastic damage could be in-
curred. Furthermcre, if the stu-
dent gets small brother’s sticky
ﬁngers marks on the copy—
well, can’t said brother just as
easily gook up a book?

As to the argument of copies
being stolen or returned late——
I believe the offender pays for
the former offense in cash. As
to the larceny 'caper———I must
confess I have known of students
who strolled nonchalantly from
the “reserve” room with a book
under their arm, card and all.
They knew they wouldn’t be able
to return the book until the fol-
lowing afternoon and really
didn’t relish paying 21 25¢ per

hour ﬁne, or [whatever the going A

rate is now. I acknowledge that
this is wrong; nonetheless it hap-

pens and makes laughable the”

book-lending policy.

Secondly,’ the non-lend policy
on ‘photostatic copies is grossly
unjust considering the Univer-

sity fee paid for precisely such

service. Of course, I am assum-
ing library privileges is one of
these services. This is a service
which is mandatory at a Uni-
versity so I donot object to, the
cost; that is to say, when such

services are rendered. But when

The fellowship is in memory of
the late Samuel Benkovitz, who
_died in February, 1962, and Janet
Heller Benkovitz, a social work
student at the University at the

4., time of her death 11 years ago.
 Established as a memorial by

',,Civil rights had been one of his
fmain interests for many years.
The fellowship will train one
student each year in commu-

The group will study the Uni-
versity of San Carlo for ten days,
centering. on the institution’s cur-
riculum and facilities.

Problems Investigated

Members of the study group are
Chancellor Litchﬁeld; Dr. Charles
A. Peake, vice-chancellor for the
Academic Disciplines;
Van ,Dusen, vice-chancellor for
the Professions; Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, vice—chancellor for Stu-

Paul H. Masoner, dean of the
School of Education.

The group also plans to send
12 faculty members from var-
ious University schools to in-
vestigate further the problems
and needs of the Guatemalan
college.

Dr. Litchﬁeld commented, “We
are extremely plea_sed to have an-
-other opportunity to assist in the
enlargement of higher education
in Latin America. This is a pro-
ject to which‘ the University is
most deeply committed.”

This would not be an exact answer to
‘the question of ‘-‘How long does a
Volkswagen last?" Truly, we just
don't know, but there are no \vorn
out ones around as yet‘. 6,000,000
Volkswagens are now on the road all
over the world. Demand still outstrips
supply. There must be a reason for
it. Why not find out for yourself and
see how many extra_ built-in features
you get in a VW besides low gas
mileage, low initial cost, and high
resale value. See M. W. Motors, Pitts-

“The Gain of Carthage”

 “Reality: Sandwich’cs”

And

~ By MATTHEW NESVISKY
Bryher’s The Coin of Carthage (Harcourt, Brace and
World, 240 pp., $4.50) is a puny Punic War novel which re-

minds us that war, any war, usually hurts the “little people”
_ of the world, too. '

The amateur historian-novelist’s l-atest work describes the

" blooded traders, Dasius and
Zonas, who scratch and grub a
living by trying to deal with
both the Romans and the Car-
thaginians. ‘

One would expect all sorts of

' swashbuckling adventures with

such a set-up, but hardly a
buckle is swashed. The pair ex-
, periences dangers in dealing
with the warring armies, but the
intrigues simply aren’t very _in-
triguing; The two characters are
at their entertaining best when
they are trying to double-deal
each other; but who needs the
trappings of an historical novel
for such Two Stoogéry?
A Warm Picture
A warm picture of a small
Roman farm is presented, how-
ever, when the author introduces
Karus and his mother,’Domina

_ Sybilla. But the novel’s plot cools

any warmth quickly, as a shep-
herd boy saves Zonas’ life, Zonas
saves Karus’ life, Dasius saves
Karus’ best friend’s life, etc., etc.,
ad nauseum historicalum.

Plumpish, balding Lawrence
Ferlinghetti has just published
the latest collection of poems by
plumpish, balding Allen Gins-
berg, Reality Sandwiches (City
Lights Books, 98 pp., $1.50).

The Beat Bard may be
changing in appearance, but
his poems remain the same
and, in an overall view, that
really isn't bad news.

"This collection of 29 poems,
written between 1953 and 1960,

. smacks of the same verve, ex-
citement and jarring imagery
and thought that typiﬁed his ﬁrst
collection, Howl and Other
Poems. The wildness and the
“dirty talk” are still in the
poems but. if anything, this new
offering shows a better under-
standing of some of the realities
of life, principally, the value of
youth.

Off To The Races

Ginsberg begins one racing
poem with" /If.I had a Green
Automobile/I'd go ﬁnd my old
companion/In his house on the
Western Ocean/Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha!/But after an insane dash
around the country, he now
knows that he will come sadly
back to his black apartment‘ in
New York.

And so sadness and reflec-
tion have joined the exuber.-
ance of Allen's Ginsberg’s re-
cent pieces. Quiet poems con-
cerned with the meaning of a.

effects of Hannibal’s threat to Rome on the lives of a hand-
_fu1 of characters. Chief among these are two Greek-

house and a garden, or a good
meal, have joined the ones
concerned with screaming an-
guish and, shouting kicks.

A good deal of his efforts may

not be poems at all, but there is-

enough .of the Touch of the Poet
to give the book merit. Some of
the most vibrant poems were
written under the effects of
drugs, such as/4 sniﬁs and I’m
High/Underwear in bed/white
cotton in left hand/archtype de-
generate . . ./ and the quality that
shines through the drunken haze
makes one wish that he could
produce without such crutches.
He can be a good poet; if only he
would allow his vision to clear
itself.

more successful here than Grits
of Navarrone.”

Must Be Saturated

Bressler then went on to ex-
plain why the movie is opening in
so many theaters. “We get the
best exploitation of a movie by
opening it in a lot of small towns.
A movie such as Gidget Goes to
Rome must be saturated , at its
playing time.

“It’s not like Lawrence of
Arabia,” he continued. “A movie
like that is like a. road show. It
depends on word of mouth expec-
tations. Mutiny on the Bounty, for
example, did not have wide audi-
ence approval. The people who
saw it were not impressed with it,
so the movie isn’t as successful as
was hoped.”

Another student asked why so

many movies appeal to the “teen
age intellect.” Bressler explained
that his idea of what a movie
should be is different from that of
David Susskind. ‘
Movies for Entertainment
Bressler sees nothing wrong
with an enjoyable, funny, under-
standable movie. “Movies are for
entertainment as well as art.
Some "people may like Ingmar
Bergman movies, but I saw Wild’
Strawberries and still don’t un-
derstand it. I "found Parent Trap
thoroughly enjoyable. Good mov-
ies don’t have to be art movies.

Walt Disney’s pictures are suc-
cessful.”

“Good pictures can be those for
the teen age intellect,” Bressler
said. “In -fact, we get as many
letters about ‘Gidget’ from adults
as we do from teen agers.”

Despite the students’ interest in
the type of movies currently being
ﬁlmed, Bressler” was surprised
that more students did not take
advantage of the opportunity to
ﬁnd out more about the entertain-
ment ﬁeld. “I expected more ques-
tions about acting,” he said after
the discussion.

Miss Carole answered few ques-
tions, and her answers were al-
ways clarified‘ by Bressler. One
student asked her if she had had

acting lessons. Theyoung actress '

replied, “I don’t take acting les-
sons. I learn more by working in
shows.” .

At this point, Bressler broke in.
“I think I’d better explain that,”
he said. “Acting lessons are
strange. A character role with
dialect requires "study, but acting
is basically an emotion. No one
can teach you how to project
that.”
