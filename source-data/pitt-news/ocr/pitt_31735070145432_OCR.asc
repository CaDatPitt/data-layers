A run into the blazingsun

Pitt junior Andrew Dilla will run 180 miles through the Sahara Desert in 10 days to promote a cause.

Mollie Durkin
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Running 180 miles in 10 days across
theSaharaDesertisn’t something most
students do two weeks before ﬁnals.

Butfor PittjuniorAndrew Dilla, this
trek is an exciting reality.

Dilla, who isfrom Edinboro, Pa., is a
youth ambassadorforimpossib1e2Pos-
sible, anonproﬁt group thatencourages
peopleto performfeats of strength and
endurance to raise awareness about
sustainability and other world issues.

Ray Zahab, the founder of impos-
sib1e2Possible, said he createdthe orga-
nizationto show people thatthey have
the capacity to do extraordinary acts.

“We so underestimate whatwe are
capable of doing,” he said. “We have
limitless poten ' .”

Dilla, 20, leaves todaylto make his

journey to the northAfrican country of
Tunisiawiththree other students —— all
from Canada —- to demonstrate the
importance of clean drinking water.

Pushingthe limits

To qualify for the trip, Dilla, who is
intl1e Panther Cycling Club at Pitt, ﬁlled
outanapplicationwith essay questions
and then had a phone interview with
Bob Cox, impossib1e2Possible’s execu-
tive director.

“I guess mybike trip and the Boston .

Marathonwere kind of sellingpoints,”

he said.

Two summers ago, Dilla and his
father bicycled 3,800 miles from
San Francisco to Yorktown, Va.,in
49 days. Prior to that, he participated

[in the Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon in San
‘ Diego, for which he raised $3,800 for

the Leukemia 8i Lymphoma Society.
Local and regional bands surrounded
the race track while Dilla ran the 13-
mile course. He clocked in at 3 hours
and 10 minutes.

Lastyear, Dilla, whowas part ofhis
high school’s cross country, track and
football teams, ran the Boston Mara-
thon as well.

He said he expects his experiences

in Tunisia to be different ﬁ'om his ex-

periences in marathons.

 

“Itwillbealot slower. It’s notarace,
and its alot more team—based. We’ll be
takingalot ofbreaks ——- it doesn’ttake
all day to rim 20 miles,” he said. He
added that there won’t be fans cheer-
ing the team on either, like in his past
races.

Dilla said he has been training for
this trip by himself since the end of
January, when he learned that he had"
been accepted to the irnpossible2Pos-
sible program. .

He also received Olympic—level
training from Zahab’s brother, John,
who coaches some Canadian Olympic
athletes. The trainingprogramhe made
for the teambegan on Feb. 8.

A federal labor agency is  .'

how Sodexo treats its workers at Pitt.

The National LaborRelations Board
began investigating Sodexo, the com-
pany that cooks the food in  of
Pitt’s diningfacilities, after the Service
Employees International Union Local
32B] ﬁled a complaint with the board
March 23. The union represents some
of the.Sodexo employees who work in
Market Central, The Perch at Suther-
land and the William Pitt Union. It has
attended several Sodexo workers’ pro-
tests on Pitfs campus.

Inits complaint, the SEIU statesthat
Sodexohasallegedly engagedin“unfair
labor practices” since aboutjanuary.
These practices include, “interrogat-
ing a worker about his union act1'vity,”
“tellingworkers thattheir effortsto or-

, ganize with a union would be ﬁitile,”

“threatening to more strictly enforce
company rules iftheunionbecomes the
collective bargaining representative,”
“threateningto eliminate cert:ainwork—
place privileges if the union becomes

the collective bargaining representa- - 

tive,” and “telling a worker that he is

' notallowedto attendaunionmeeting

and threatening to discipline him for
attending such meeting,” accordingto
the complaint.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele de— 

clined to comment on the issue.
“'I‘hisisanat1'onalissuebetweenthe
union and Sodexo,” Fedele said. “We
will not be commenting at this time.”
Sodexo has about 400 employees,
accordingto the complaint.

Pitt launched a mobile version of C

its website last week, delighting
some students.

The site, m.pitt.edu, brings to-
gether several University resourc-
es — a campus events calendar, a
campus map and Pitt’s Find People
tool, to name a few — and pres-
ents them in a form compatible
with most Web-capable phones.

“This gives you access to the
University no matter where you
are,” Brian Decima, a site architect
for Pitt’s Computing Services and
Systems Development, said. i

The site, which does not have
a ‘‘w’’ in front of its name,
also has a list of Twitter feeds,
including the official University
account, Pitt Tweet; The Pitt

.News; Pitt CSSD and My Pitt. It

also features a campus news link

that has a collection of articles’

from ﬁve campus publications,
including the Pitt Chronicle, the
athletic department and others.

Senior Mark Meyers said he '

likes the campus map feature avail-
able on Pitt’s site. Last month, he
paid $1 to get a Pittcampus map

offers better. The iPod Touch map
only offered street names, while
-the Pitt map includes the locations
of campus buildings, he said.

Junior Meghan Danielsons said.

the Pitt map feature helps her ﬁnd
“those obscure classes in buildings
you’ve never seen before.” She’s
also excited about the “Hours”
link that the site provides for com-
puting labs, libraries, dining halls,
ﬁtness facilities, bookstores and

the Registrar’s Oiﬁce.

“It’s deﬁnitely convenient to
not have to pick up the phone and
call to ask for that,” she said.

Both Meyers and Danielsons
said they were disappointed the
site doesn’t give them access to
what CSSD calls “security servic-
es” — enrollment information
and grades.

SGB proposes groups  

advertise funding sources

Student organizations would have to print ‘-Paid for by the
Student Activities Fee’ on all public advertisements.

- Carla Trinca- Conley
Staﬂ" Writer

Student Government Board introduced two
new resolutions at its meeting last night to
a small collection of students in Nordy’s
Place. , ‘

Board member David Petrone announced
a resolution pertaining to student groups
receiving funding from the Board.

Student organizations that receive al-
located money from SGB would have to

sororities and fraternities without losing
either party’s nonproﬁt status. Previous
legislation did not allow nonproﬁts to do-
nate funds to sororities and fraternities,
forcing the organizations to raise their own
funds to ﬁx housing safety issues.

The SGB resolution said students be-
longing to sororities and fraternities op-

erating nonproﬁt housing contracts are

currently unable to raise money to improve
smoke detectors, alarm ‘systems, sprinklers
and other housing facility safety measures.

The resolution would allow SGB to write to -

Board President Charlie Shull said y
this will allow students to see how the
Student Activities Fee is being spent.

print “Paid for by the Student Activities A

Fee allocated by the Student Government
Board” on all public advertisements. This
resolution is part of SGB’s larger goal to
make the allocations process more visible
to students. - '

Board President Charlie Shull said this

willallow students to see how the Student »

‘Activities Fee is being spent.

Shull also introduced a resolution to
support the Collegiate Housing and Infra-
structure Act, a federal legislation intro-
duced in 2009 that is currently in a House
of Representatives committee.

If passed, the act would allow the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and any other non-
proﬁt organization to donate funds to

legislators on behalf of the “student popu-

lation of Pitt” in support of passing the '

Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure Act,
rather than just on behalf of Pitt’s fraterni-
ties and sororities. V

This expands the base from which they‘
can receive funding, Shull said.

Board member Phil LaRue, working
with fellow board member David Gau, an-
nounced their project of creating a “con—
stituent assembly” last night.

The constituent assembly would include A

17 elected representatives from all parts
of campus. l E V

Runner’s route takes him to scenes from Star Wars

speed work, one day is hill work and weekends

, are devoted to long runs that could last for two

hours.

“One ofthe mostimportantparts about itwas

running with a hydration pack [a backpack with
a hose that allows runners to drink hands free],
becausewehavetogetusedtot:aking...ﬂuidswhile
running and eating on the run,” he said.

He said he spends much of his time running
on soft surfaces, suchas those found in_Schenley
Parkand FrickPark,because they have less impact
on his joints.

The terrain ofthe desertwill presentachange,
though. Alarge part ofthe region the team is run-
ningthrough is salt ﬂats, but there will probably
be sand dunes as well, he said.

To prepare for the change of scenery, Dilla
consultedanunusual source— Starwars. Scenes
from the movie featuring the ﬁctional planet
Tatooinewere shotin'Iunisia. '

“I actually justwatchediANew Hope’ the other
day to see where I’ll be going,” he said. “There’s a
canyon where that part of ‘Star Wars’ was ﬁlmed
in, and ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ was also ﬁlmed

there.”

He said the route through'Iunisiawill beginin
Tozeur, in southwest Tunisia, and end in Gabes,
along the country’s southeastern coast. .

Cox and Zahab, both of whom having expe-
rience with endurance events, will accompany
the team.

“I’ll be running every step of the way,” Cox
said. “We run as a team. It’s not a race. It’s their
expedition; were there to support them.”

Dilla said the twotrain“a little bit diﬁerently”
than other team members do, but both are very

‘ other team members will ﬁlm videos for “Back—

Story,” a show on CNN International and will be
videoconferencing with about 10,000 students
inthe United States and Canada. ‘

The conferences will be in real time through
satellite communication. The team does not yet
knowwhat time itwill hold the video conferences,
but there is an 8-hour time difference between
British Columbia, on Canada’s western coast, and
Tunisia . ‘ ‘

CNN Internationalprovided the teamwith Flip
video cameras so its members can upload videos
throughouttheirtrip, Cox said. He said dailycov-
erage of the teamwillbegin next Monday.

A new adventure

' The actual run will represent only one facet
of Dilla’s trip. He said he’s excited to learn about
'Iunisiancult11re. ’ '

Dilla said he was raised Catholic, but that
he thinks Islam is interesting, and has always
been curious about it. He added that he went to
a mosque last Friday to “check it out.” Dilla said

He said the customs were similar to ones he saw
in Morocco during Semester at Sea.
“The prayer motions were really intense,” he

said, adding that he went through the motions .

withthe congregation. .
But Dilla isn’t excited about all aspects of the

‘ trip, despite loving advent11res — he said he has

a couple fears about being in such a desolated
area. 1
‘‘We’re goingto haveasupportteamand Land

Dilla, who is majoring in history, hopes to
graduate in December and then attend medical
school. He saidhiscurrent18—creditloadhas not
been easy but that his professors allowed him
to reschedule his ﬁnals to make his trip across
Tunisia. He said he worked with his professors
to schedule some earlier and some for when he

Schenley Quadrangle, as well as off-campus
students living in South and North Oakland
and commuters.

The representatives would meet twice a
month, act as a lower chamber to carry out
ofﬁcial SGB business and be able to pursue
their own projects, LaRue said.

LaRue said the project was driven by
Board members’ desire to “see a Student
Government Board representative of all
students.”

Shull said the proposal was a “mega-
progressive direction for Student Govern-
ment.”

Shull said the documentation will be
available online and he will “expect” and
“push” for a lot of student debate.

LaRue also announced the formation
of two new Green Fund task forces — one
for the creation of the Green Fund and one
for the creation of the Student Sustainable
Projects Committee.

The groups’ responsibilities will include
seeking further project submissions and
interested applicants for the committee
and reviewing documents already prepared
— the draft manual and the draft charter,
LaRue said.

Lost walletwoes

 
 
  

Ben Korman
For The Pitt News

It was somewhere in the two-block
stretch between Bates Street and Fifth
Avenue. That’s where I lost my wallet.
I had noted its absence from its
usualpocketsomewhere alongcoltart

Avenue, but didn’t concern the matter ,

much—thehourwaslate,Ihadbarely
walkedtwoblocksandIiiguredI’dsim-
plyleititatrrtypointofdepartmelwas
sure I’d retrieve it the next day.

In the morning, I conducted a
thorough search of my friends’ living
room,butto no avail.Ithenchecked
the establishment at which I had last
used my debit card.

The next stop was Panther Central
—IneededanewPittIDsinceIhad
boughtast11dentticketforaPit1:football
game.Tl1isprovedproblematicbecause
PantherCardscost$2oto renew, and I,
of course, was functionally broke.

I would have to head to the bank,
explain my situation to the teller, re-
port my lost debit card and withdraw
the necessaryﬁinds. Naturally, the on-
campus PNCbranchwas closed, aswas
the next—closestbranch atFil’chAvenue
and Craig Street.

Telefactwas mylasthope. The rep-
resentative informed me that I had a
half-hourtomake itto aPNC branch on
the West End before ittoo closed.

However, my lack of a Pitt ID
stripped me ofthefreebus-ridingprivi-
legesthisinstitiitionso graciously offers
me, and I didn’t even have $2.25 to pay
the layrnan’s fare.

My journey was over. Not only
would I have to watch the game from
home, but I’d also have to apply for a
new New York state driver’s license,
report my debit card as lost, apply for
a new one and also deal with whatever
havoc my wallet’s new owner had de-
cided to wreak on my bank account.
To makemattersworse, Iwasjusttwo
punches away from a free six-inch on
my Subway Club Card.

Ididn’tbothert11ninginwhen game
time rolled around because I already
knew what the score was: World 1,
Ben 0.

After a week of contemplation, I
now blame the debacle on the ﬂawed
model ofthe wallet itself. Iflhad simply
kept one item apart from the others,
this whole situation could have been

avoided.

Indeed, the wallet has risen to its
currentprevalence duetoconvenience:
Ifwekeep allourthings inthe same

place, we don’t have to ﬁimble around
for them.

The ﬂipside is the colossal risk. In
idiomaticterms, the wallet“putsallour
eggs in one bas ”

Yet over the course of evolutionary
history, several species of birds have
gone extinct because they, quite liter-
ally,puttoo manyeggs inonebasket
— predators ruin a particularly large
batchinonefell swoop. The riskherein
rougl1lyapproximatestothatofthewal-
let.Bykeepingsomanyimpo11antitems
inthe same place, we tempt disaster.

Homosapiens, on the other hand,
have beneﬁted immensely from more
conservative managementofouryoung
because,A—we usuallyjusthave one
“egg” in our “baskets,” and B — our
“baskets” just happento be inside our
uteri.-

Thus, the concept of the wallet
disregards one of the primary factors
behind our rise as the most dominant
species on Earth.

Even historically, putting all our
important stuff in the same place has
netted some downright nasty results.

TheStockMarketCrash of1929 and
ensuing depression, the incapacitation
of millions when Gmailwent down, the
ﬁnancialruinofBernie Madoifsvictims
and the natural security risks incurred
when severalprominentworld leaders
arenestledwithinthe same municipal-
ity — a la last year’s G-20 here in the
Steel city — are all testaments to the
fact that we should abolish the wallet.

Irealizelcastabroad shadowwith
thisargument. Granted, thewallet does
haveits advantages. Considerthatwhen
the Pitt police ultimately returned itto
me -—- it had somehow escaped my
pocketoncoltartandwas rescuedbyan
“anonymous motorist"—therearenot
one but two forms of photo identiﬁca-
tioninwhich myfacehasbeenoutﬁtted
with a curly mustache, a monocle and
atop hat.

Here, at the very most, the wallet’s
consolidation factor may have indi-
rectly given me a legitimate excuse to
actually grow a curly mustache, wear
a monocle and don a good ol’ Lincoln
hat -—- and yes, this might sound awe-
some on the surface.

But this is trivial compared to the
dangers we face by keeping all our
important stuff in the same place. If
we wantedto avoidrepeatingour past
mistakes, we’d keep our cash in one
pocket, our driver’s licenses in another,
our Panther Cards in our armpits and
our Subway Club Cards in our uteri.

THE GILES FILES

Laws, leaders not the solution

Citizen legislatures the real ftxfor governmental ineﬁtciency and corruption

 
 
  

Giles Howard
Columnist

Writing about warrantless wiretaps

lastweek, I concluded that the federal

government holds too much sway
overthe lives of individual Americans

and that its intrusiveness can only be

diminished through non-traditional
solutions which limit the power of
both government oflicials and politi-

cal parties.

Indeed, we have passed the point _

where a package of laws, a change in
power or a court decision are capable
of doing anything more signiﬁcant
than blunting the government’s will
to power. Thus, ﬁndinga solution
capable of permanently rolling back
the size and power of government
is the pressing cause of our modern
Republic.

Last week, I suggested that the
answer might be a part—time federal
legislature. Through this plan, the
Congress would —- like Texas’ legis-
lature — meet for only 140 days ev-

ery two years to set abiennial budget
and then meet in a special session if
a crisis arose.

The value of the part-time legis-
lature is that it requires legislators
to work and live as citizens under the
laws they pass. In theory, it eliminates
the insulation of career politicians at
the same time it lowers costs.

Currently, the creation of part-
time legislatures is the subject of
state-level activism where support-
ers of limited government seek to
replace full-time state legislatures
with part-time ones in an attempt to
lower costs and eliminate corruption.
This movement is gaining speed in
Pennsylvania where the high cost of

, the state legislature —— $300 million ,

annually— and the frequency of cor-
ruption trials provide ample reason
for a move to part-time status. ,.
Writing for the Commonwealth
Foundation — a Pennsylvania think
tank based in Harrisburg — Nathan
Beneﬁeld said, “There is convincing
evidence that restoring the General
Assembly to part-time citizen legis-
lature would result in lower taxes,

more efficient government and less
corruption.”

But more important than creat-
ing part-time legislatures at the state
and federal level is the need to cre-
ate citizen legislatures. Admittedly,
changing legislatures from full-time
to part—time would go 'a long way
toward accomplishing this, but it
wouldn’t necessarily solve the entire
problem. I

First, I should explain that a citi-
zen legislature is one where the legis-
lators are citizens with unrelated full-
time jobs rather than professional,
career politicians who live off their
legislative salary. In many ways, it is
possible to identify a citizen legisla-
ture by examining the armual salary
of a rank-and—ﬁle legislator in any
given state.

Take your time before choosing your destiny

 
   

Katie Azzara
Columnist

I have no idea what I’rn doing with
my life aﬂzer college. In fact, I haven’t
had a clear direction in mind for quite
some time.

Vague memories still exist of an

L elementary-school version of my-

selfwho hoped to be an artist some
day. Though ﬁnger painting isn’t the
best measure of actual artistic ability.
Eventually the realization dawned on
me thatI didn’t have the skill to make
a living in this trade.

_ From time to time, my parents try
to convince meto follow intheir foot-
steps and become a speech—language
pathologist. Butasfor having my own

, dreams in life, I have to say that re-

cently I have felt a bit lost.

This, of course, made the whole
college application process slightly
frustrating, especially when schools
required me to respond to essay
prompts such as, “Howwill attending
our university help you to accomplish
your life goals?” Uh, what goals?

Instead of trying to ﬁgure out the
answer to that question, I ended up

writing an essay that creatively dis-
guised the factthatl had no ideawhat
Iwanted to do with my life.
Choosing a major was an even
trickier task once I was admitted
to college. Whﬂe people around me
chose career—oriented majors in en-
gineering, education and business, I
opted for the one that sounded the
most interestingto me even if itwere
slightly vague —— communication.
Paired with my other topic of study,
Spanish, it still doesn’t offer me much

talent that I never knew I had and be
able to make a living off that for the
rest of my life.

But with my older sister gradu-
ating in May, she’s had to do some
serious thinking about her life after
college, and it’s made me realize that
someday soon, that will be me. The
thought of graduating and moving on
to the real world is daunting enough
for most college students. For those
of us who remain undecided about a
career path, it’s all the more unset-

After all, a life goal isn’t
exactly something that can
beestablished simply.  

of an orientation toward any speciﬁc
career.

Until recently, I didn’t reallythink
too much about my lack of direction,
hopingthat maybelwould just stum-
_ble across a career and have every-
thing fall into place. Or, better yet,
that I would be discovered for some

tling.
It is this fear that leads some stu-

dents to hastily and impulsively select .

a career path —— especially with the
notion that not ﬁnding a job right
away means you’re destined to dwell
in your parents’ basement.’ Despite
my lack of direction, I still think

rushing it is an unwise move. While
perusing my psychology textbook I
read that it is normal for people to
change jobs as many as seven times
throughout their lifetime. After all, a
life goal isn’t exactly something that
canbe established simply. It’s the kind
of thing that most people just know,
and if not, they have to discover it.

Thus, I have to caution those of
us who don’t “just know” what we
want to do with our lives against pre-
maturely choosing an occupation.
Consider this: Isn’t it worse to force
yourself into choosing a career path
than it is to wait until you ﬁnd some-
thing that you truly love and want to
do for the rest of your life? _

I think that people tend to forget
that entering the workforce is not
the only option that they have after
graduating from college. If you have

, the means, travelingis an option that

might point you in the direction of a
career or at least give you some ex-
tra time to think about it. Programs

such as the Peace Corps and Teach

ForAmerica are also viable options of

productive post-college activities.
But ifyou have no other choice but

to get a job after graduation, remem-

ber that it can be useﬁil to explore a
number oftemporary jobs before set-
tling on a full-time career. It’s ﬁne to
be undecided aboutwhatyou want to
do, but you’ll certainly regret spend-
ingyour life—-— or at least the younger
years of it — doing something you
hate just because it’s the ﬁrst job you
were offered.

My advice to people like me -
those concerned about the fact that
they do not have any deﬁnite post-
college plans — is simply to keep
your options open, and wait until
you ﬁnd something that genuinely
sparks your interest. There are plenty
of explorative opportunities to take in
the meantime.

Now, it’s not realistic to expect
that the perfect careerwill just magi-
cally appearupon graduation. Infact,
it would be impractical to think that
way. But for those of you who haven’t
been blessed- with the knowledge of
what you want to do after college,
it might be just as silly to expect to
arbitrarily choose a career path and
expect to be content with it for the
rest of your natural life.

In contrast, New Hampshire is _
. considered to have a citizen legisla-

ture because their legislators receive
a salary of only $200 per two-year
term with no per diem, according
to data from 2008. Similarly, New
Mexico pays its legislators nothing;
Alabama pays its legislators only $10
per day and a handful of states pay
their legislators less than $15,000
ayear. ,
By paying legislators far less than
they need to live on, citizen legisla-
tures cultivate a membership that

is truly dedicated to public service
rather than monetary gain. Further-
more, the rniniscule pay of citizen leg-
islatures requires that legislators hold
full—time jobs in the state in which
they legislate, thus forcing them to
work under the laws and regulations

they enact.

Examining the salaries of federal
legislators, it is clear that members
of Congress occupy a position more
similar to that of Pennsylvania leg-
islators than their New Hampshire
counterparts. Speciﬁcally, the base

pay of a member of Congress in2010
is $174,000, a rate of pay thatmakes
sitting in Congress a ﬁill—time job.
By way of further contrast, mem-
bers of Congress in the early decades
of the Republic received no ﬁxed sal-
ary and only a $6 per diem for each
day the Congress was in session.
With $174,000 a year plus ben-
eﬁts, senators and representatives
don’t work outside the Capitol. They
don’t work under the regulations they
enact and they certainly don’t run a
small business impacted by Obama-

care. , 0

So while making federal and
state legislatures part-time bodies
would constitute a step in the right
direction, it’s important to recognize
that the ultimate goal is the creation
of citizen legislatures. Such legisla-
tures rest on their members being
successful members of the private
sector rather than career politicians
who live off taxpayer dollars.

This can best be accomplished by
returninglegislative compensation to
its early republican roots when leg-

Citizenlavvmakers more dedicated to public service

islators were compensated for their
expenses and little more. Aiterall, the
citizen legislatures of the Revolution-
ary Era produced the brightest and
best statesmen in this nation’s his-
tory. The Founders’ collective talent
and intellect has yet to be matched by
the current professional legislatures
and their political career—oriented
members.

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Girl on the Train’ stays on track

French drama examines the reasons behind a faked anti-Semitic hate crime and its repercussions.

Courtesy Strand Releasing
Jeanne (Emilie Dequenne) and her mother (Catherine Deneuve) deal with anti—Semitic controversy.

Andy Tybout
Staﬁ’ Writer

I From “To Kill a Mockingbird”

to “Munich,” hate crimes have
served as cinematic fodder since
the ﬁlm industry’s inception. But
in the French ﬁlm “The Girl on the
Train,” acclaimed director André
Téchiné throws a wrench into the
formula —— what if, Téchiné asks,
the hate crime was fake?

Based on a real incident in
2004, the ﬁlm follows a young
woman, Jeanne, through her slow
psychological deterioration, cul-
minating in her impulsive deci-
sion to cast herself as the vic-
tim of a fabricated anti-Semitic
crime. ‘

Jeanne’s descent accounts for
nearly half the ﬁlm. At the begin-

FEATURE T

Berger makes a splash
with ‘Water Test’

Jocelyn Meehan
Stajf Writer

It’s time to tear down that tacky “Wedding
Crashers” poster hanging on your wall and
replace it with a new unique piece that screams
individuality and soul. In fact, take this op-
portunity to get rid of all your college posters
because nobody_cares about your house rules
for beer pong.

Suitable for an Urban Outﬁtters’ wall,
Chicago artist Laura Berger’s artwork comes
across as a vibrant combination of color, in-
novative design and quirkiness.

Berger’s work has been showcased in the
United States, Canada and at indie craft mar-
kets. She does freelance illustration work and
is currently trying to write and illustrate a
children’s book. V b

If you enjoy interesting modern visuals,
cute creatures and would like to meet the
artist, WildCard is the place to be Thursday
night.

WildCard, one of the newest additions to ’

Lawrenceville’s growing design district, will
be hosting afree reception from 6 to 9 p.m. for

Berger’s presentation of her collection entitled .

“Water Test,” a series of work not surprisingly
inspired by the natural element of water.
WildCard is a gallery owned by Rebecca
Morris, a Pitt graduate, and it’s located at
4209 Butler St. in Pittsburgh.» '
The boutique opened in October. It show-
cases artists, sells homemade craft items and

is a really cool place to just hang out —— you

can evenplay pinball in.the back. y
“We have a gallery area where we feature

. artists every six weeks. Laura will be our ﬁfth

show,” Morris said.

Berger willbe WildCard’s ﬁrst non—Pitts-
burgh artist to be featured, and she’ll be in
attendance at the reception to chat and answer
questions.

Besides getting to hang out with Berger
in person while perusing her art, Morris said

WildCard will also provide munchies during
the reception, and the shop will be open for
purchases.

“Laura’s art is some of the more special
work we sell here in the store, and it’s always
been a personal favorite of mine,” she said.“She
combines humor and elements of Japanese
and street art in really unique ways.”

The press release says that the size and
medium of Berger’s work vary, but most are
acrylic or gouache on paper or wood.

According to her blog, Berger plans on
bringing 27 new paintings on paper and wood
to WildCard along with other prints of her]
work. . .

If you can’t make it to the reception,
Berger’s exhibit runs from April 15 through
May 26. '

WildCard’s business hours are 11 a.m. to 7
p.m. Tuesday through Saturday (open until 9
p.m. on Thursday), noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday,
and it’s closed Monday. -

CD REVIEW

‘Masterful

Brian Pope
Staﬁ Writer

Fans of legendary bands Metallica and The

Beatles probably never thought that it would
happen — a mashup of the best of both
genres. They most likely questioned the
musical practicality of such an epic rock
collaboration.

To those loyal devotees’. doubts and res-
ervations, guitarist Grg Hammetson ‘III,
bassist Kliff McBurtney, drummer Ringo
Larz and lead vocalistjaymz Lennﬁeld have
only one word in response: Beatallica.

The idea for this mashup band started
with one concert recording of a single called
“A Garage Dayz Nite” performed by Ham-
metson and Lennﬁeld in 2001. It was not
until a year later that the original group
members met Dr. David Dixon. P

Dixon created a web page and dubbed
the act Beatallica in homage to the groups
who inspired their uniquely arranged songs.
Since ﬂeshing out its lineup in 2004 and
releasing its ﬁrst album Sgt. Het_ﬁeld’s Mo-
torbreath Pub Band in 2007, Beatallica has
maintained a low proﬁle and made all of
their music available for free download to
protect themselves legally.

Maxtegfulll/lyxtegz Tourcaptures Beatallica’s
playful spirit and musical creativity very
well.-It doesn’t matter whether listeners
take songs like “I Want to Choke Your‘Band”
seriously because it is clear that the band
itself does not. The average rock fan is more
likely to walk away satisﬁed after listening

CD REVIEW

lt’s Too Late for Roses with
a mediocre ‘Debut’

Larissa Gula
_ Staff Writer

Described as alternative and punk, Too
Late for Roses kicks off its album Debut
with a song that ﬁts its genre mold. “Take
Me Out” runs through swiftly with a solid-
sounding instrumental mashup of guitars,
drums and the other necessities of just
about any punk band. ’

The vocals sound like they were run

through a synthesizer, blending into the
music. When are they understandable?
When the singer screams, “Take me
out.” .
The band tones it down for most of the
album, begging the question: Why compose
two hard punk and techno style songs that
don’t ﬁt in with the rest of the album?

Too Late for Roses

Debut

LPE

Sounds Like: Pacific
Dust '

Grade: C+

None of the other songs really tune into
the “punk” genre, instead becoming soft
alternative and guitar based. Even then,
whatever the band members sing is often
not noteworthy. It’_s easier to listen to their
music and stare into space daydreaming
than it is to pay attention to their lyrics.

But the last track on the album, “Win—
ter Tide,” is almost 20 minutes long. And
while it starts this ﬁnale off with a fantastic
acoustic guitar, it ﬁlls about 15 minutes
with what sounds like static. What was the
point, guys? Static is for bad cable con-
nections, not album releases that need to
make a good impression. _,

This album isn’t bad for a “debut” -
but seriously, it lost a ton of points for
static.

T rain ’s strongest moments occur in middle

it seems everyone in this film teeters on the

brink of debilitating sadness —— a modern
melancholy borne of missed opportunities

and dreams unfulfilled.

a range of emotion perfectly tailored to
Jeanne’s bizarre predicament. It seems

everyone in this ﬁlm teeters on the brink
of debilitating sadness —— a modern mel-

ancholy borne of missed opportunities and "

dreams unfulﬁlled. By the end, viewers
get the sense that all these characters,
not just Jeanne, have suffered some sort
of breakdown.

Emilie Dequenne is especially cleft
in her portrayal of Jeanne —.— making it
impossible to dismiss her character as
merely “stupid” or “naive.” As a result,
viewers may feel more sympathy towards
the fraud’s perpetrator than any other
character. .

The emotional weight of the ﬁlm’s end,
however, comes up a bit short. Because
the story’s centerpiece —Jeanne’s break-
down —— falls precisely in the middle of
the ﬁlm, the subsequent action serves as
a sort of calm, extended resolution. In

S contrast with most movies, the most pow-

erful scenes are found in the middle — the
moments whenJeanne is most vulnerable
and most devastated.

There, at least, the audience feels
there’s a real danger — a frailty that’s
profoundly affecting. ' ‘

I’m not sure if this emotional dissipa-
tion is a problem the ﬁlm could ever fix,
given the fact that a faked hate crime re-
quires both background and consequence
to fully comprehend. But when the credits
roll, it may seem the emotional weight
of “The Girl on the Train” has disap~
peared.

Make no mistake: “The Girlqon the
Train” is an excellent study of Jeanne’s
fragile psyche, and in most other respects,
an excellent ﬁlm. Just don’t expect itto
break your heart. ' '

Pnther football players toenter NFL draft‘

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

They won’t be stepping onto Heinz
Field with aP_itIjerseyagain, but some
members of last season’s Pitt football
team mightremrnto the North Shore
wearing the logo of an NFL team next
year.

At least eight players have hired
agents and declared for the 75th NFL
Draft Aaron Berry, Nate Byham, Dorin
Dickerson, Adam Gunn,John Malecki,
Gus Mustakas, Bill Smll and MickW1l-
liams will all be eligible for the draft,
which begins on April 22.

This year’s draft takes place over
three days at Radio City Music Hall in
New York, with the ﬁrst round held

during primetime on Thursday night.
In previous years, the draftwas onlya
two-day event.

In the draft, NFL teams select
graduating seniors and eligible un-
derclassmen (if they have been out
of high school for three years). The
players selected then begin contract
negotiations with the team. The player
is not guaranteed a spot on the roster,

and he does not have to sign a con-
tract. Ifhe holds out, he can sit out
that year and re—enter the draft the
followingyear.

This year, the St. Louis Rams have
theﬁrstpick, and it is widely speculat-
edthattheRamswillselect Oklahoma’s
quarterback, Sam Bradford. Bradford
wonthe HeismanTrophyasaredshirt
sophomore in 2008.

Accordingto three different mock
drafts —from ESPN, Sports Illustrated
and Bleacher Report — no Pantheg
are expectedtobe selectedinthe ﬁrst
round.

However, over the next week, The
Pitt News will talkwith some of these
players and provide an in—depth look
at each player’s drafthopes and future

NFL DRAFT

Versatile Malecki
aims for pros

Offensive guard faces size disadvantage

Michael Furlong
Staﬂ’ Writer

It’s not often that you hear a
6-foot-2, almost 300-pound m
called “undersized.” V

But size is a major concern for
John Malecki, the departing right
guard of the Pitt football team.

“Unfortunately, size is going to
be a factor with me,” Malecki said.
“I’ve been preparing myselfto play
center at the next level because my
height doesn’t really meet what
teams look for.”

Malecki hopes to earn the op-
portunity to prove that his size
is not a factor at the NFL Draft,
beginning on April 22.

Malecki is one of several Pan-
thers who hope to be selected dur-
ing the three-day event. If he is not
selected during the draft, Malecki
still has a chance to enter summer
training camp as an undrafted free
agent. ~

Not all scoutsxsee Malecki as a
center prospect, as he is ranked
by nﬂdraftscout.com as the No.
41-ranked offensive guard in the

’ draft class.

Malecki could be a high-upside

H type of player because he’s only

played on the offensive side of the
ball for two seasons. He didn’t be-
gin playing offensive line in college
until spring practice before his
junior season.

As a true freshman, Malecki
made an immediate impact on the
ﬁeld, getting playing time in 12
games and recording 11 tackles,
all at defensive tackle.

' Returning to the defensive line
as a sophomore, Malecki increased
his impact, playing nose tackle in
12 games and recording four sacks
on the year. ’

The following spring, Malecki
moved to the offensive side of the
line, where he had not played since
his senior year of high school.

Malecki’s transition earned
him the starting right guard spot,
and he started in all of the sea-
son’s 13 games. At the conclusion
of the season, Malecki received the
team’s Most Improved Offensive
Player award.

Malecki not only made an im-
pact in his junior season on the
football ﬁeld, but he also excelled
in the classroom, being named to

- the Big East All-Academic Team.

Malecki, a business market-
ing major, is still unsure what he
wants to do after his playing days
in football are ﬁnished. ’

“I’m not sure what I eventu-
ally want to do with my degree,”
Malecki said. “At some point I
would like to get into coaching,
though. Probably starting at the
high school level to help build up
a program and maybe move up in
coaching from there.”

It’s certainly possible with his

TENNIS RECAP

2 — game streak breaks  

Only one duo won a match for the Panthers this weekend.

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Stajf Writer

The Pitt tennis team’s two-game winning
streak snapped over the weekend, as it fell
in consecutive matches to No. 55 Marshall
and Cincinnati in Huntington, W; Va.

On Saturday, the Panthers lost 7-0 to Mar-
shall. 4 - 4 . , f

Elizabeth Adams and Sharmon Benic won
the only match of the day for the Panthers,
defeating Michaela Kissell and Kara Kucin
.43-'7_ (3) in doubles. . . . 5
"  V ' “Thatwas their bestwin of the season,” Pitt
head coach George Dieffenbach said. “That
was an outstanding team they defeated. They
were mentally tough in that match.”

The duo of Adams and Benic impressed

George Dieffenbach:

“The team was well focused and played
very well against Marshall,” Dieffenbach
said.

He wasn’t as pleased with the team’s per-

‘ formance against Cincinnati, as the Panthers

fell 4-3 in a closely contested match.

Pitt started well, clinching the doubles
point after Adams and Benic won 9-7 and
Adela Aprodu and Parbhu picked up an 8-6
win. . .
In doubles, however, the Panthers failed
to pull through in close matches._Three of
Pitt’s four singles losses came in three”-set
matches. 1 ‘ “ ' W “ ’ 7 '

“That’s very tight,” Dieffenbach said. “We
battled them until the very end.”

Aprodu and Parbhu picked up singles wins
for the Panthers. Aprodu won 6-4, 4-6, 6-3,

The team was well focused and played very

well against Marshall.

Dieifenbach all season. He said they are con-
sistent and aggressive but play defensive ten-
nis when needed.

“They also return serves well,” he said.
“They attack. That’s what produces Wins.”

The Herd swept the next two matches to
take a 1-0 lead into singles play. The duos
of Gabrielle Catanzariti and Sabrina Visram
and of Sarah Dieffenbach and Karma Parbhu
both lost 8-0.

Marshall won all six singles matches in
straight sets. Dieﬂfenbach said Adams had a
good showing against the nationally ranked
Kissell, losing 6-4, 6-4. Adams showed she
was a very tough competitor, Dieffenbach
said.

, Despite the loss, Dieffenbach said the team
played well against “arguably the best [team]
on the schedule.”

while Parbhu won in two sets 6-2, 6-2.

“Credit goes to them for winning,” Dief-
fenbach said.

Dieffenbach commented on the “close and
competitive” loss for Adams, as she fell in
three sets to Lindsey Lonergan 6—7(3), 6-4,
6-3.

“We came very close, but close is not good
enough,” Dieffenbach said of Pitt’s loss to the
Bearcats. “It was a very disappointing out-
come, but now we pick up the pieces and prac-
tice well to get ready for our next match.”

Pitt’s next match starts its ﬁnal stretch of
the season. The Panthers will travel to Rhode
Island on Friday to take on Providence at 2
p.m. Pitt wraps up the regular season with
matches against St. John’s and Connecticut.

The Big East Championship is set to begin
on April 22 .

ANALYSIS

 gne putt for he American faml

  

MCT Campus

With his third Masters win, Phil Mickelson is saving the family.

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

 

How are you feeling, America? Pretty good right
now?

Of course you are. This past weekend was
marvelous, just a wonderful display of why we
love sports.

Character. V

Yes, ifthere’s one aspect of sports thatwefans
love, it’s when good things happen to people we
don’t knowbutthinkdeserve goodthings, based
on their public persona. And vice versa.

So it was only ﬁtting that over the weekend
Phil “Lefty” Mickelson won the Masters. After
clinchinghisthird Masters title, Mickelson hugged
his wife Amy, who last year was diagnosed with
breast cancer. It was a beautiﬁil moment with
plenty oftears, and not solely bythose participat-
ing in said hugs.

Or as CBS announcerjim Nantz said as Mick-
elson sankhis lastputttowin, itwas “awinforthe
family.” Indeed.

But perhaps you’re still not convinced that

Mickelson’s victory helps aim America back to-
wardfamilies huddling aroundthe crackling radio
listeningto “The Lone Ranger” as opposed to its
current direction — an all—out premarital orgy
paradingas a dating show on VH1.

Maybe you don’t think of Nantz as the voice
ofthe country, whichisﬁne, even if itis incorrect.
Let’s take a look at the pulse of the sports world,
as represented by some of the country’s most
prominent sports writers. Here arethe headlines
of a justafew articles written inthe pastfew days
about the Masters.

On AOL Fanhouse,_]ay Marriotti penned a
colurrm titled “The ending we needed: Phil and
Amy, hugging.” Yahoo!’s Dan Wetzelwrote about
Mickelson’s caddy in “Leﬁy’s Masters win unlike
any other.” Mike Lupica provided the Daily News’
contribution to the straightening out of society
with“At Masters, champion Phil Mickelson shows
good guys canﬁnish ﬁrst.” And lastly, ESPN.com
chimedinthankstoRickReilly’s “Mickelson’swin
avictory for women.”

This seems likea good placeto note: The Mas-
ters are held every year at the Augusta National
GolfClub, acoursethatopened in1933 andhasyet

S eed and smarts
s ould help Malecki

Malecki 4 13 v

Diana Connor] SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Malecki (No. 74) has anchored the Pitt offensive line, and now he’s looking for NFL play.

history of being able and willing to switch
positions, as well as his good standing off the
football ﬁeld, which could propel Malecki to
a late-round draft selection or a chance as an
undrafted free agent in training camp.

While Malecki might not have the size
some NFL teams look for, his other statistics
do not disappoint. At Pitt’s Pro Day, Malecki
put up 25 repetitions of 225 pounds on the
bench press, a number that at the combine
would have put him in the middle of the pack
for offensive linemen.

Malecki’s strength isn’t the only statis-
tic that could impress NFL scouts. He’s re-
corded a 40-yard dash time as low as 5.04
seconds, and is consistently around the
5.16-second mark. Both numbers would
put Malecki in the top 10 of the offensive
lineman invited to the NFL combine.

The fact that Malecki was not invited
to the NFL combine should not discour-
age interest in his ability. The combine

prided itself on the fact that every offensive
lineman in attendance was listed as taller
than 6—foot—3 and weighed more than 300
pounds, both numbers that Malecki does
not have.

While Malecki has been the consistent
anchor of the Panthers’ offensive line for the
past two seasons, he very well could get a
chance to do the same for an NFL team.

Looking back on his time at Pitt, Malecki
has had plenty of good memories.

“The standout moment looking back was
probably the Notre Dame game from this
season,” Malecki said. “The whole envi-
ronment surrounding that game was great,
from walking into the stadium to game time
itsel .”

Malecki is hopeful about his future.

“If I don’t get drafted I won’t be that wor-
ried about it. Being an undrafted free agent
isn’t as bad as it sounds. All I have to do is
get a tryout and impress one person.”

appreciated. Exrery time Mickelsonwins a major,
how many percentage points does the divorce
rate drop over the next month?

But why are all these stories about the state
of the_ American family coming out, now? Well,
the Masters saw the return of Tiger Woods, who‘
hadrft competed inatournament since November
because hewaspreoccupiedwithhisperformance

going to be afavorite any time he’s competing as
he’s arguably the  golfer ever. A

But that didn’t matter last weekend. History
and odds had nothingto do with it. Or not nearly

as much to do with Mickelson’s win as his great -

character did.

It’s the exact opposite reason that over the
weekend, former Pittsburgh Steeler Santonio
Holmes learned he’ll need to ﬁnd a new place
to live after being traded to the New Yorkjets.
Holmes, 26, ﬁnished last season at seventh in
the league with 1,248 yards and was
the MVP of Super Bowl XLIII in Pittsburglfs 27-

. 23win against the Cardinals. Hewastraded for

a ﬁfth-round draft pick.

The immediate reaction for most was that _

thejets stole Holmes. But Holmes has had some

A instance, Holmeswillmisstheﬁrstfour games of
