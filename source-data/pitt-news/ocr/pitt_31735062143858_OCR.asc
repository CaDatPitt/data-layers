Lang Explains
Protestantism

Inquiry Forum Hears
Preacher Tomorrow

The second of a series of three re-
ligious discussions will be presented
before -the Inquiry Forum tomorrow
at 12:30 o'clock when Rev. Dr. David
Lang, pastor of the Shady Avenue
Presbyterian Church, will answer,
“What is Protestantism?”

Rabbi B. B. Glazer of the Rodef
Shalom Congregation opened the sym-
posium last Wednesday when he dis-
cussed Judaism and its precepts. Re-
ferring to his faith as an “ethical
monotheism,” Rabbi Glazer stressed
temperance in all things as the guid-
ing principle of Jewish life.

A history of Protestantism from its
formal inception by Luther until the
present day,.when groups as widely
separated as the Episcopalians and
the Unitarians are placed under a
Protestant classiﬁcation, will be out-
lined by Dr. Lang. In addition, the
reasons for the change in ceremony,
the evolution of the faith, and its
modern problems will be presented.

Next week, a priest, as yet not
chosen, will speak on “What is Cath-
olicism?" before the forum. His talk
will conc1ud’e“'the explanations of re-
ligions as such, and will be followed
by a defense of atheism.

The views of the speakers, says Ru-
dolph Morgan, president of the forum,
are presented without a desire to es-
tablish faith in any religion. They
are not meant to conﬂict, or to be par--
tisan statements. The series, he
points out, aims to give Forum mem-
bers a more_.__enl_ightened idea of three
popular beliefs, ‘and to make them ac-
quainted with the conceptions of co-
religionists who do not worship in the
same way.

Dr. Boots Commends City
Manager Plan At Meeting

 

Dr. Ralph S. Boots, professor of po-
litical science, declared at the Penn-

sylvania Conference on Present Day
Crises in Government at Harrisburg
last week, that the city manager plan
is the only system that supplants po-
litical patronage by business meth-
ods in the conduct of government,

The two-day conference was pre-
sided over Tuesday evening by Dr.
Francis D. Tyson, professor of eco-
nomics. In his Wednesday speech
before the conference, Dr. Boots also
attacked" overlapping governmental
functions, double assessments, double
collections of taxes, multiple inspec-
tions, and the fee system in public
office as opposed to sa-laries.

Dr. Tyson pointed out the critical
economic plight of the state, stress-

on relief in Pennsylvania, and that
funds must be made available for
these unemployed. “Philadelphia and
lAllegheny County indices of employ-
iment," he said, “have fallen off 40 per
cent since 1929, and wages have
dropped 60 per cent.”

College Association's Dance
Proﬁts go to Aid
of Students

Start Membership Drive

An expenditure of $365 aiding eight
students to attend the University this

years was announced by the cabinet of
the College Associaton this morning.
It was revealed that approximately
seventy-ﬁve students have been helped
by the association since its founding
in 1926.

A recent cabinet meeting voted an
additional sum of one hundred dollars
to the $265 which were being spent at
that time. No student can receive
more than $50, thus assuring a good
turnover of the Association's loan
fund.

Dr. Omar Held, personnel director
of the College, praised the work of the
Association in assisting students to
continue their studies at the Univer-
sity. He pointed out that the social
side of the College Association's activ-
ities have been given more publicity
that the really basic work of the loan
fund for the maintenance of which
the social program:-has been devised.
It was also pointed out that the Col-
lege Association is the only other or-
ganization on the campus, with the
exclusion of WSGA, which uses its
proﬁts in this manner.

The College Association was estab-
lished in 1926 and adopted its consti-
tution on December 1-0, 1926. The As-
sociation was established to foster
greater unity of spirit and action.in
the College, to advance social interest,
and to promote the general welfare of
students and of the University. Rob-
ert A. Jarvis, Col. '33, is president of
the group.

The two dollar membership fee of
the Association includes an informal
dance next Friday, and a formal dance
in May. Memberships are on sale at
the present time and are limited to
350 students.

 

 

Mardi Gras Shows Profit: 1

committee meeting on Friday, an
estimate of the ﬁnances of the
-Mardi Gras shows a net proﬁt of
between $300 and $400. Final re-
ports will be made. at Mrs.
Mitchell’s office, 809 Cathedral of
Learning. Approximately $450
was realized from the sale of
1,700 tickets, $60 from check

under $400.

 

Freshman Dance
“ Shows Probable
Profit Today

Approximately 187 couples at-
tended the Freshman Dance
last Friday night at the Webster
Hall Hotel, according to an in-
complete and unofficial report of
the affair. . It has been intimated
also that a margin of proﬁt has
been realized, although its extent
is as yet unknown.

Emil K. Meacham, Bus. Ad. and
a committee of 21 ﬁrst year stu-
dents succeeded in presenting a
deﬁnitely successful social as
well as ﬁnancial d-ance, with par-
ticularly clever dance programs
shaped in the form of Fresh
dinks, and with a series of novelty,
musical presentations by Burt
Weidenhamer’s popular 12-piece
orchestra. The Grand March
was held at 10 o'clock, with Miss
Dent Strock, Ed. '35, and Meach-
am leading. Dancing lasted until
1 o'clock.

There were two surprise offer-
ings at the affair, the ﬁrst being
the selections given ‘by a talented
accordionist — a. newly added-
member of the Weidenhamer or-
ganization.

The second was a. routine of tap
dancing steps by Willi-am Pillich,
special student, instructor in
tap dancing at Trees Gym, and a
star of last year's Cap and Gown
show. Pillich was persuaded at
the last minute to entertain the
guests with an intricate arrange-
ment of shuffle-ball-changes,
time-steps, and Flying Dutchmen.”

81 Women Are

Taken Into 15-

Fraternities

 

Women Rush 198 in Second
Semester’s Period;
Heads Show Pleasure

 

Figures Show Decrease

 

Eighty-one women were inducted
last night with traditional cere-
mony into ﬁfteen of the women's
fraternities on campus. Out of the

198 marked eligible for rushing, these
were in the group that accepted
bids to join and were accepted by the

group in which they were inter-
ested.
Mary Garber, president of Pan-

hellenic ‘Council, expresses herself as
quite Satisﬁed with the outcome of
the season's rushing. “Because of
existing economic conditions,” says
Miss Garber, “Council expected that
there would be a correspondingly
large drop in the number of women
joining fraternities on the campus."
However, this year's quota is only
eight less than last year's of eighty-
nine.

Of the 117 women whose records
were marked eligible and who did
not join a, fraternity, some originally
accepted no rushing invitations.
Those who attended rushing events,
received bid-s, but did not accept -gave

as their reasons any or several of the"

following: ﬁnancial, parental ob-
jection, interested in a fraternity
that did not rush her, not interested
in fraternity, or cannot join now but
wishes to join later.

Pledging last night marked the end
of the formal rushing season. Be-
ginning March 20 and extending
through the end: of the semester,
open bidding will be in session.
Council expects that this season will
greatly enlarge the quota of fra-
ternity women.

Yesterday afternoon mothers

of
freshman women were entertained

Technocracy Useless For
Students Says Dr. Johnson

 

“Technocracy will have no effect
on the incentive of college students
to do advanced work,” Prof. Roswell

racy," assured a, number of students
last Thursday at the combined semin-
ar meeting of the oil and gas and the

One of the tricks of cigarette advertis-
ing is to pretend that“HeatTreatment”
is an exclusive process,making one cig-
arette better than any other.
EXPLANATION: All cigarette manu-
facturers use heat treatment. It is a
routine process of manufacture. The
ﬁrst Camel cigarette ever made was
manufactured under the heat-treating

 

process. Every one of the billions of
Camels produced since has received
the necessary heat treatment.

Harsh, raw tobaccos require inten-
sive processing under high tempera-
tures. The more expensive tobaccos,
which are naturally mild, call for only
a moderate application of heat. Heat
treatment never can make cheap, in-
ferior tobacco good.

It is on fact, well known by
leaf tobacco experts, that
Camels are made from ﬁner,
MORE EXPENSVE tobaccos than
any other popular brand.

This is the most important statement
ever made in a cigarette advertisement.
Weigh its words. Consider what it
means. Then try Camels.

Speaking as the head of the depart-
ment of football tactics of the Univer-
sity, Dr. Sutherland lifted a three-

month moratorium on football prac- '

tices to take effect next Wednesday
afternoon on the practice ﬁeld, when
varsity, freshmen, and those who
have the desire to participate al-
though they have not had any pre-
vious football experience will join
hands for a ﬁve to six weeks’ spring
training period.

In issuing his perennial call for
spring practices, Dr. Sutherland said:
"I want to make the invitation plain
for those students who have the de-
sire to play football, but have had
little or no previous experience.
They’re wanted just as much as the

and varsity squads. Football at Pitt
isn’t a closed institution as a great
many have been led to believe in the
past. If the boy has a desire to play,
we don’t want him to think that the
way of making the team is impossi-
ble. His chances are just as good as.
the seasoned varsity player.”

Although many colleges in the coun-
try already have gotten in from three
to nine weeks of practices, Dr. Suth-
erland frowned on the idea of
lengthy spring practice sessions. Last
year 26 days of spring practices were
held on the campus. This year the
number will probably be the same.

“Spring practices at Pitt,” said the
doctor, “are far more important al-
though they are considerably shorter
than the majority of such sessions at
other colleges and universities. Just
about two weeks before we are to be-
gin our fall campaign, the boys go to
camp. About all the time we have
‘there is to get the ‘boys into condition
for their strenuous season. At the
spring practices we must outline and
work on the plays which we will use
during our season, which the other

schools can do in the fall because of
their long preliminary training period!
I personally, don’t like the idea of at
long spring practice. I feel that the!
participants are under too much of a
strain, and the boys suffer too much
scholastically, which is more import-
ant than spring training.”

Uniforms will be issued varsity
men Monday afternoon at the Sta-
dium locker room and Tuesday after-
noon the freshmen will receive their
playing outﬁts with the ﬁrst prac-
tice session to begin the following
afternoon.

Between 60 and 75 potential candi-
dates for next year’s team will in-
dulge in the preliminary practice ses-
sions at the practice ﬁeld. Spring
training will be brought to a close at
the conclusion of the Easter vacation.

Dr. Sutherland will be assisted in
his training programby Dr. Roscoe
“Skip” Gougler, head freshman foot-
ball coach; Andy Gustafson, assistant
to Sutherland; Ray Montgomery and
and Ralph Daugherty. _

Eliminating one game from their

relations with Pitt after a lapse of six

Cagers Need One More Vic-
tory tor Championship

 

Blasting -the eastern league hopes
of Temple :Saturday night, the Golden
Panthers moved within striking dis-
ance of the league’s ﬁrst champion-
ship flag with a 40-30 victory over
the ‘Owls.

It was the last game of league com-
petition for the Temple ﬁve When
they faced the Panthers in Mitten
Hall. Previous to Saturday night’s
game, the Owls had won ﬁve of their
seven games, having lost only to
Carnegie Tech and Pitt.

Gaining a 14 point lead over their
opponents during the ﬁrst half the
Panthers coasted to their ﬁfth league
victory during the latter period. Don
Smith, Rus Ochsenhirt, and Don Mc-
Camant, ﬁring the scoring guns of the
Panthers held the Owls to a nine
point score during the initial half,
while the -trio of Panther stars
amassed a total of 23 points for the
Blue and Gold.

After the beginning of the second
half, the Panthers eased off with
their scoring, content with guarding
the scoring advances of the Owls
throughout that period of play.

The Owls had depended upon Reds
Rosen, the league’s nbest individual
scorer -to bring them a much desired
victory, as the defeat of the Panth-
ers Saturday night would have given
them the opportunity of tying the
Panthers for ﬁrst place in the league.
The close guarding of the Temple
guard, aded to .the difficulties of the
Owls for a victory, and their defeat
was marked soon after the game’s be-
ginning.

,With, two more games to play, the
Panthers now need but one more vic-
tory to assure themselves possession
of the ﬂag of the newly organized
cage league. These games include
return engagements‘ with Carnegie
Tech and West Virginia, teams which
have been beaten by the Panthers on
previous occasions.

as in an inter-class basketball compe-
tition, the seniors ﬁrst captured vic-
tory from the sophomores with a 4
to 2 score; then the juniors narrowly
won over the freshmen with a similar
4 to 2 score.

During the matches Miss Dorothy
Joyce, of Peabody, and Miss Jeanne
Muter, of Taylor-Allderdice, judged
the coeds in action. When the ﬁnal
game had been played, they an-

There seems to be quite a difference
in the food served at West Point and
Annapolis . the Navy boys get
the break on the food . . . which re-
minds us that a few more trips by the
Pitt boxers to Annapolis would cause
an increase in the Naval food budget

It’s certainly too bad that Pelucha

vault 12 feet, 8 inches is a sure point
winner . . . and Skippy Hughes has
been reported as favoring more pub-

suffered through the loss of “Splin-

they’ve certainly uncovered a big help

Disability Causes Much
Change in WAA Team

 

 

Because of physical disabilities, too
many activity points, and a lack of
interest, several changes have been
made on the WAA honorary swim-
ming team, the latest WAA innova-
tion. Dorothy Lee will replace
Evelyn King on the senior team;
Helen Crozier’s position will be taken
by Mary Elizabeth Reinard on the
sophomore team; the substitution of
Margaret Huey for Lulu Stilley has
been made on the freshman team.

The group is continuing its prac-
tice according to the rigid rules pre-
pared by Mrs. Frances Tracy, adviser
of the WAA swimming team. The
primary purpose of the new organiza-
tion is to place ﬁrst in the four events
of the inter-telegraphic swim meet
sponsored by Pitt to take place some
time in the month of March.

Temple Holds
Score Records

Rosen Leads; Don Smith is

Fourth With 46 Points

Scoring 16 points against Temple
Saturday night, Don ‘Smith, Pitt
basketball team captain advanved
from eleventh to fourth place among
the individual scoring leaders of the
Eastern Intercollegite Basketball
Conference. Don McCamant added
ﬁve points to his total and continued
in ﬁfth place in the race for individ-
ual scoring honors. Smith’s points
were made as a result of _16 ﬁeld
goals and 14 fouls in six conference
games. In the same number of
games McCamant has scored 18 ﬁeld
goals and nine fouls.

Reds Rosen, of Temple, conference
scoring leader, has totaled 82 points
on 23 ﬁeld goals and 36 fouls in the
eight games played by the Owls. The
Conference schedule for Temple is
now completed while Pitt has two
more league games remaining with
West Virginia, this coming Saturday
night, and with ‘Carnegie Tech, March
17; but it is doubtful if either of the
Pitt leaders can displace Rosen. To
do this Smith and McCamant would
have to average better than 18 points
per game. A considera.bly better
chance is open to Bobby Smith, Tech
co-captain‘-, who now possesses 54
points and has three games yet to
play.

Averages up to date indicate that
Dr. Carlson’s team is the best of-
fensive and defensive team in the
Conference. Pitt has limited her op-
ponents to 23 points per game, at the
same time averaging 35 points
against her league opponents.

Pitt has undisputed possession of
ﬁrst place, ﬁve victories and a loss
giving a, percentage of .833. At the
present time Temple is in second
place with ﬁve victories and three
losses, but as the Owls’ season is
ﬁnished the best they can possibly
get is a tie for ﬁrst place. Carnegie
Tech, ‘maintains  mathematical
chance of capturing the champion-
ship. Should the Tartans win all
three Olf their games, while Pitt is
losing her next two, the ﬁnal stand-
ings would be Carnegie Tech six vic-
tories and two losses, Pitt ﬁve vic-
tories and three losses.

Elimination ol: Center Jump
Gets Trial in Varsity Game
Tonight; Frosh in Prelim

 

Panther Boxers Favored For Match With Wash-Jelit Mitt Tealil‘
Tonight; Crsini May Shitt Siegel to Lightweight C
Class, Giannatti to Welterweight

The Panther will have ample opportunity to snarl tonight when
the Wash-Jeff basketball and boxing teams invade the Stadium pa-
vilion tonight in what will provide a “triple—feature” attraction for
any fan interested enough to attend. Two basketball teams and a
boxing team will represent W. & J. tonight, and unless something
radical takes place, the Panthers are quite likely to take all three

contests.

Dr. Carlson’s new play to elimin-¢

ate the center jump will be given a
trial in the varsity game tonight.
Play will start with the ball being
thrown in from the center of the
ﬂoor, the ball being put in play alter-
nately by each team. Time will be
“out" from the time a ﬁeld goal or
-foul is made until the ball is thrown
in to begin play again.

Coach Zehfuss’ unbeaten frosh
basketball team should have little
trouble in winning tonight. The
varsity team should also add to its
string of victories as the Wash-Jeff
basketeers are hardly likely to pro-
vide enough opposition to make the
game interesting. Maury Leiber,
star forward on the President ﬁve will
cause whatever trouble the Panthers
will encounter.

The affect. if any. that the abolition
of the center jump will have on the
Panther offense will be interesting to
notice. Incidentally this will mark
the ﬁrst time that the center jump
elimination has been tried at Pitt
since the Muskingum game, a few
years -back.

Joe 0rsini’s boxers will ﬁnd them-
selves in the unfamiliar position of
favorites for tonight’s bout with W.
& J. A shifting in weights will likely
be tried, with Bernie Spiegel ﬁghting
in the lightweight, or 135-pound
class, and Jimy Giannatti ﬁghting at
145 pounds. Both boys can make the
138-pound weight li-mit for the light-
weight class, so the Pitt entry for
either class will not be known until
ﬁght time.

The remainder of the squad will
likely be unchanged, with Junge in
the 115—pound class; Gambatese or
Conte in the 125-pound class; Schrick-
er in the 155-pound class; Captain
Seigel in the 165-pound class; Joe
Kopp in the lightweight class.

The W. -& J. -squad has yet to win a
match, but may provide an upset in
tonight’s bouts. McCarrell, 125
pounds, and Captain Demodowitz, 175
pounds, are the best bets for \Vash-
Jeﬁ victories.

WAA Presents
Novel Cabaret

Novelty Dances to Feature
Women’s Event

 

Reminiscent of the eighteenth cen-
tury, Ye Olde Hicke Taverne will be
the form of WAA’S annual cabaret
to take place in Heinz House on
March 15 from 5:30 to 8:30 o’clock,
One of WAA’s oldest traditions, the
cabaret is sponsored solely for Pitt
women. Every year it is modeled

after a mode prevalent at one era-. '

Last year’s cabaret was a Gay Nine-
ties’ Bar. Music by a dance orchestra,
a. full program, and an old fashioned
meal, will form the entertainment of
Ye Olde I-Iicke Taverne.

Novelty dances and songs will com’-
prise the amusement. Charlotte
Nlady, Ed. ’33, will do a tap dance.-
The sophomore physical education
class will do an American country
dance. A song and dance quite char-
acteristic of its name, Goofus, will be
done by Betty Quarrie, Col. ’34. Jane
McNamara, Ed. ’34, will be an eccen-
tric dance. The surprise of the pro-
gram will be the appearance of that
famous WAA pair, Hilda Ru-bin and
Adelaide Hunter, who will revive one
of their old numbers. 1

The dinner will be served by
waitresses garbed in overalls. VVhi1e
the coeds will be dining, blue and red
bandanas will be distributed as favors,

General chairman Jane Walton, Ed,
’33, is rapidly ending all arrange"-
ments for the affair. The admission
fee is 35 cents, 25 cents for members.

Another New Deal

GENE-RALiLY‘con-ceded, to now, that positions on athletic ﬁelds at
the University have been open to achosen few, a new deal in
athletics is now seen arising. There has been agitation in the past
few years of the over specialization as well as overemphasis in the
ﬁeld of athletic endeavor—that one must of necessity be a good ath-
lete before an opportunity to tryout for various teams may be ex-
tended——that 0ne’s name must be known——that one must “have a
drag”—until now, athletics have taken on a purely professional
rather than amateur standing.

This growing feeling of professionalism in athletics has led to
reforms which now point to a considerable revaluation of collegiate
athletics the country over.

As a result, the year on the campus has seen broadening of
student enlistment in athletics on the campus. Last fall, the ﬁrst
‘call of such a nature was made by Carl Olson, track coach at the
University, when an invitation was extended any student on the cam-
pus to participate in the University ’s ﬁrst fall track and ﬁeld games.
Today, Dr. John B. Sutherland opens another ﬁeld for the average
student. In his pronouncement of the beginning of the spring foot-
ball practice next week, Dr. Sutherland is explicit in his invitation
that students who have the desire to play football, but have had no
past experience on the playing ﬁeld, to try out for positions on the
varsity squad.

Such a thing as this was, not so many seasons ago, practically
an unheard of idea. Football players were not made, they seemed
to be born to the football playing ﬁeld. Solicitation of athletes of
known quality was openly made, and the novice shunned as one of a
dread disease might be. The idea that equality existed among
those who had a desire for positions on athletic teams, was an en-
tirelydisregarded one, so far as those in charge of athletics were
concefned.

What might be the results of this change of policy can not
easily be determined, but one thing that this revision of attitude will
do is to arouse more interest, which has, despite the increase of
stadia. and box ofﬁce receipts, grown lax in recent seasons.

Dr. Sutherland and Mr. Olson deserve commendation for the
attitude they have taken. They know that to extend. an invitation
to include anyone who has the desire to participate will increase
their training problems—for fundamentals of training, of form, and
of play will have to be taught those who have not had experience
at the same time instruct those who have “graduated” because of
their past experience and training in the advanced workings of
athletics. But seeing the advantages, and the increase of interest in
athletic endeavor they are willing to take on additional duties that
the equality which has been forgotten in the mad race of overﬂowing
cash bags which has weighed the. success or failure of athletics in
the pastgmay once again put athletics as a student activity rather
than a stadium building business.

Not once in the year did the ultra-
violet report for duty with the longer-
waved visible light. This, according
to the report, was not because the
luminous energy got an earlier start;
both started from the parent sun at
the same instant and at the same
speed. Both raced ne_ck,to neck un-
til they reached the earth's atmos-
phere.

Here, the visible radiation plowed
ahead, but the ultraviolet radiation
pancaked and disappeared-. It was not
able to pierce the heavy smog and
had to wait until the sun had gained
in altitude before it contacted the
earth. There was always a delay of
minutes.

From October to March, the sun's

gives them an advantage, for they
may encourage delay; and with the

sale before the ratiﬁcation machinery
got under way, opinion might change
in states which are now wet by a
small plurality. And this danger is
particularly real in view of the imme-
diate necessity for increased revenues
which a taxed beer promises. In
spite of the Democratic promise of no
return to the “open saloon,” there is
no provision in the repeal resolution
for a control of the liquor traffic be-
yond the prohibition of the importa-
tion of liquors in dry states. No
doubt even in this enlightened decade
there are numbers of people, other-
wise wet, to whom that phrase “open
saloon” connotes all the bestiality of
the old San Francisco water-front on
a ‘Saeturday night. They have forgot-
ten, of course, that state regulation
of the saloon, as in Pennsylvania,
often worked very well. But no doubt
they are justiﬁed in their demands
that a socialized or stringently regu-
lated distribution be substituted for
the existing laissez faire policy.

One of the writers brave enough to
make a deﬁnite prediction on the out-
come of the pending submission of
repeal to the states is Mr. Russell
Owen of the New York Times. Class-
ifying the states into four classes of
for ratiﬁcation, probable ratiﬁcation,
doubtful, and against ratiﬁcation, Mr.
Owen ﬁnds eleven states in the doubt-
ful and against ratiﬁcation columns,
making repeal possible.

Repeal Probabilities

There is good reason to believe that
his estimates are as accurate as such
things usually are. But considering
that the repeal probability of it is
only by a margin of one state, any
slip-up through a. false indication of
feeling in recent elections or a pos-
sible change of public opinion would
render such a prediction unreliable.
Mr. Owen's listing of two states, Kan-
sas and Oklahoma, as certain dry ter-
ritory is believalble enough. But in
others, in the light of more or less
deﬁnitely wet and dry referenda re-
cently voted upon, his predictions are
deba.table. North Dakota, for in-
stance, which he lists as sure to rat-
ify, has been dry since 1889; and al-
though it recently repealed its state
enforcement act, it did so by only a
small margin. Washington, listed as
a probable ratiﬁcation state, has
shown a very deﬁnite wet sentiment
by a popular vote in which the drys
lost, 217,000 to 139,000. On the other
hand, Oregon, also listed in the prob-
able ratiﬁcation column, has shown
only a mildly wet opinion by a vote
on the repeal of an unusually strin-
gent state prohibition act which wets
won by a mere few thousand votes.

‘Mr. Owen's’ estimates ‘are offered
as such. And they are, on the whole,
accurate enough right now. But it is
pertinent to observe that we are prob-
ably witnessing right now the high
tide of anti-prohibition feeling, with
a good chance of a. decline in coming
months.

How Wets Win

Supporters of the repeal resolution
hope for ratiﬁcation by the necessary
thirty-six states before this year is
out. And it is likely that they will
get it, for there are only ﬁve state

discouraged by three major blows.

First, recent banking failures
have given conﬁdence a severe
setback. The Review says, “The
failure of the banking structure to
function properly in these critical
times is a striking argument for
the need of banking reform.”
Secondly, the Congressional mo-
guls in their dissections upon the
future of the important. Recon-
struction Finance Corporation,
have given the country a series of
“shakes." And too, the shady in-
vestigations conducted by Con-
gress liave been anything but in-
spiring to national hopes.

However, the Review holds
forth to hopeful readers at least
one gem of good news. This is
the growing disposition to accept
inevitable losses and to write
down ‘debts and capitalstructures
to tolerable levels.’' As ultimate
recovery is dependent upon such
action, the Review considers that
recent tendency to be very en-
couraging.

Phi Sigma Sigma_Lmia_n Hahn’ chases since the Freshman Dance last

Friday has practically assured the suc-
cess of the informal Engineering As-
sociation Dance Friday at the Grotto
Club on the North Side, according to
E. H. R. Pegg '33, president of the As-
sociation and general chairman of the
affair.

Billy Weixel’s well known ten-piece
Pittsburgh orchestra will play from
9 to 1. This is the same band that
was booked for the formal dance of
the College Association last semester
and for the Physical Education formal
in January.

Entrance to the Engineering Dance
is possible only through the purchase
of a membership ticket to the Associ-
ation, selling for one dollar. These
tickets entitle undergraduate engi-
neering students to admission to both
the dance and the general engineering
smoker which takes place in May.

Pegg’s committee is composed of
the eleven other representatives on
his Engineering Cabinet, which is
composed of two delegates from each
of,the six departments in the Engi-
neering School.

The chairman conﬁdently expects
that ticket sales will at least hit the
standard reached last semester when
400 men registered in the Association.

Mr. H. C. Pavian, instructor in
aeronautical engineering, Mr. S. J.
Tracy, instructor in mechanical en-
gineering, and Mr. William Brinker,
faculty adviser of the Association and
instructor in chemical engineering,
with their wives will serve as chaper-
ons of the affair.

Financial Structure Tottering!

 

So Claims Dr. Van Dusen, Prophecying Dictatorship,
Poverty and Suffering in This Country

 

The ﬁnancial structure of the coun-
try stands in a more perilous condi-
tion at this moment than at any time
since the foundation of the Republic,
claimed Dr. Henry Van Dusen, dean
of Union Theological Seminary, at
his assembly address here at noon
Friday. Striking a, pessimistic tone
throughout, Dr. Van Dusen preached
a gospel of complete destruction of
our political, social, and economic in-
stitutions. A small audience in Me-
morial Hall heard the address which
was sponsored by the campus YM and
YWCA.

“A mild form of dictatorship seems
to be the direction in which we are
moving," said the speaker, on the day
before Presidlent Roosevelt's inaugu-
ration. He scored the “proph-ets" of
a. better day and suggested a mora-

torium on all political prophecies.

Declaring that in fifty years we
shall have a radical transformation
with a new and far more perfect era,
Dr. Van Dusen laid the cause of the
present depression as the “ultimate
price of the World War."

The speaker dismissed the prem-
ises of the technocrats, the socialists,
and the reactionary capi-talist group,
and left his audience hanging on a
string of pessimism, declaring, “that
this country faces a. major break-
down of society's health and society's
nerve."

A dismal note was brought into the
address when the speaker pictured

a gloomy America where poverty for

millions and general discouragement

will be a semi-permanent feature of
the period into which we are advanc-
in-g.

Saying that recovery will be pain-
fully slow, Dr Van Dusen prophecied
no work, hardship, poverty and anx-
iety for the people of the United
States He claimed that the tradition-
al skepticism of youth is being out-
done by the skepticism of experienced
adults, and ﬁercely attacked the
“prophets" of 1930 who were unable
to see the coming cataclysm. “They
.Weren’t sufficiently wedded to the
truth,” he said of the men with whom
President Hoover conferred following
the stock market crash in 1929.

Although the picture he painted
was one of intense pessimism, the
speaker said that the men of the fu-
ture must have intelligence, realism,
and insight coupled with beauty, good-
ness and ‘simplicity. He deplored
personal ambition and called for

intellectual dogmatism of the era."
