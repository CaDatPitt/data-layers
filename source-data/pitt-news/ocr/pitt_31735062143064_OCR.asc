Vets Group
Fills Openings
In Directorship

The Veterans’ association’s
board of directors is at full
strength, once more following the
appointment of Walter Thompson
and Robert Lee Hutton to the
vacancies created by last week’s
resignations by Earl Kelley and
Larry Gibson.

Stuart Workmaster, Vets asso-
ciation president, disclosed the
names of the new directors last
Friday. Both appointments are
temporary. -

Still unﬁlled, however, was the
post of editor of Fire Power, of-
ﬁcial association organ. Kelley
relinquished the post at the same
time that he quit as director.
Workmaster will retain control
of the paper until a new editor
can be chosen.

Disagreement over President
Workmaster’s policies brought
about the resignations of Kelley
and Gibson. Both men felt that
the association should remain non-
political, while W0-rkmaster be-
lieves that it must enter politics
in order that it may best serve
its members.

Thompson and Hutton will serve
on the board until permanent di-
rectors are chosen at the spring
election.

Druids Return;
Outline, Plans

After almost a year of inactiv-
ity, Druids, an’ honorary activi-
ties fraternity, is making a con-
certed effort to return to active
status before spring tapping.

The ﬁrst major reorganization
meeting will take place Thursday
at 12:30 in room 113 C1.

Last week a group of six for-
mer Druids met with Dr. John
Maxwell Ferguson and outlined
plans for the future. A new con-
stitution is being prepared and
soon will be forwarded for ap-
proval_. It is likely that the re-
quirements for attaining Druid
honors will be changed.

The reason for Druids’ dismissal
from campus was a political ‘one
and it has been agreed that,
should Druids return to Pitt, pol-
itics will no longer -enter into a
man's chances of becoming a

member.

New Interpretation Course

Set For Summer Semester

Courses in interpreting French and German into English, as
taught by specialists in the School for Interpreters of the University
of Geneva, Switzerland, will be offered at Pitt duirng the summer
semester and the 1947-48 school year. These specialists have trained
many of the expert linguists who served as interpreters at recent

international conferences.

Dr. Elizabeth Waelti, a member of the Geneva faculty, will come
to Pittsburgh for twelve months‘:

to demonstrate and apply the
techniques developed in the School

‘for Interpreters for this highly‘

specialized language instruction.
The course at Geneva, which

produces the fully qualiﬁed “Par-.

liamentary Interpreters,” requires
a minimum of three years of in-
tensive study and practice. Quali-

.ﬁed Pitt students may be able to

meet the requirements for the

pﬁrst of the three proﬁciency

grades recognized by the School

A for Interpreters.

To qualify as translators, stu-
dents must devote their time en-
tirely to the language course with
related studies in the geography,
history, and institutions of the
countries concerned.

The ﬁrst phase of ‘instruction
planned by Dr. Waelti will apply
specialtechniques to develop ﬂu-
ency and accuracy in the oral use
of the foreign language, particu-
larly with subjects that are most
commonly involved in internation-
al communications.

Arrangements with Dr. Waelti
provide for further training in in-
terpreting at the University of

» Geneva for those who show suf-

ﬁcient promise in their work here.
Credits earned at Geneva will be

_ applied ‘to degrees at Pittsburgh.

Large Turnout At Spring

 

Drills Hampers Coaches

Spring sports at Pitt have run into a snag—the right kind
though. So many candidates have reported for practice that
harrassed coaches are looking in desperation for more practice
space, dressing facilities, and equipment to meet the overﬂow.

Coach Ralph Mitterling had 47 candidates for battery posi-
tions working out at the Stadium for several weeks. Then, more

than 50 men responded to the calle

for inﬁelders last week. These
two groups have overflowed the
small indoor ﬁeld.

By the time weather permits
the squad to go outdoors, base-
ball ofﬁcials expect to have 150
players in action. '

However, heads have already
begun to fall. With Coach Ralph
Mitterling wielding the ax, some
ﬁfteen men have been cut from
the list of pitching candidates,
which formerly numbered over
forty.

“We’ll carry only eight pitchers
on the squad; four of them with
the traveling_ squad,” said Coach
Mitterling. “Considering the brief-
ness of the season, a larger staff
would only prove cumbersome
and unnecessary.”

Thus far practice sessions have
consisted largely of bunting, slid-
ing, and limbering up the throw-
ihg arms.

The air is chilly under the Sta-
dium, but Mitterling does not an-
ticipate any arm trouble. “As
long as the boys keep working,”
he explained, “there is no danger.
We’ll go outdoors as soon as we
get a break in the weather.”

I Grid Uniforms Scarce

As for football, 115 aspirants
greeted new head coach Mike Mil-
ligan on the ﬁrst day of spring
grid drills. This group was out-
ﬁtted, while mpre than twenty-
four were temporarily turned
away from lack of uniforms. Be-
sides this group, football directors
willhave to plan for the ’46 let-
termen who are due to report on

Cupple’s All-Stars _
Defeat Benedetti

The week’s choicest piece of in-
tramural basketball was dished
out in an exhibition game by the
Benedetti club and Cuppleis All-
Star. The All—Stars won, 39-38.

Benedetti’s had already cinched
a berth in the playoﬁfs by captur-
ing the Physical Education league
title. But the Cupples, led by Mc-
Crossin with 14 points, were too
much for their opponents.

Three one-sided games” took

Allegheny Y in two battles for th
championship of the Metropolita-
YMCA league.

Thursday night Allegheny sur-
prised Pitt with a display of spec-
tacular shooting and won/ easily.
76-61 on the Allegheny court.

The following night Pitt sought"
and gained revenge by winning
57-46. Razzano and Skladany led
the scoring for Pitt with 16 and

The Synthesis of Nylon

 

Chemists of original nylon research team honor memory of Dr. Carothers at the dedica-
tion. They are: J. W. Hill, Ph. D., M. I. T. '28; H. B. Dykstra, Ph. D. Ohio State '27; G. J.
Borchet, Ph. D. Colorado '29; J. E, Kirby, Ph. D. Iowa State '29; E. W. Spanagel, Ph. D.
McGilI '33; D. D. Cotfman, Ph. D. Illinois '30; and F. J. Van Natta, Ph. D. Michigan '28.
Dr. Carothers received his Ph. D. from Illinois in ‘I924.

Recently the Nylon Research Labora-
tory near Wilmington was dedicated as
“The Carothers Research Laboratory,”
in honor of the late Wallace Hume
Carothers and his classical researches
on the structure of polymers, the mech-
anism of polymerization, and the in-
vention of nylon.

In 1928, a group of chemists under
Carothers began a study of polycon-
densation which led eventually to the
discovery of nylon. The project; was
part of a program of fundamental re-
search to discover scientiﬁc facts which
might be of eventual value in laying a
foundation for applied research.

As the ﬁrst point of attack, they chose
the condensation of dibasic acids with
glycols and reaction materials which
would preclude the formation of rings.
They obtained linear polymers of mo-
lecular weights between 2300 and 5000.

Molecular Weights Increased

After two years, a signiﬁcant advance
in linear polymer preparation was
achieved. Through the use of the molec-
ular still, it was possible to obtain ma-
terials of molecular weights between
10,000 and 25,000, which, when molten,
could be drawn into ﬁlaments.

More important, the cooled super-'
polyester filaments could be further
drawn into ﬁbers several times their

original length and thereby acquired
luster, tensile strength, elasticity, plia-
bility, and toughness much greater than
the initial polymer. In contrast with
ordinary textile fibers, their tensile
strength was unchanged byiwetting.

The striking properties of the ﬁbers
aroused the hope of ﬁnding a commer-
cial ﬁber from some type of linear
superpolymer. Investigation showed,
however, that ﬁbers from the polyesters
were too-low melting and too soluble
for textile purposes. Mixed polyester-
polyamides were also not of interest in
this category.

Research on Fibers

The possibility of a commercial ﬁber
development seemed remote, but the
intuition that frequently accompanies
research genius prevailed, and Carothers
was encouraged to direct his research
on superpolymers speciﬁcally toward
spinnable ﬁbers. A polyamide from 9-
aminonanoic acid gave a ﬁber of 195°C.
melting point, equal in strength to silk,
and clearly indicated the possibility of
obtaining a material for ﬁberstof com-
mercial utility.

In 1935, the superpolymer from hexa-
methylene diamine and adipic acid was
ﬁrst synthesized. It melted at 263°C.,
was insoluble in common solvents,

tough, elastic and had the best balance
of properties and manufacturing costs
of any of the polyamides then known.
A third period of research covered
commercial development. The task was
enormous, and to reduce to a minimum
the “time between the test tube and
the counter” a large force of some of
the most competent chemists, physi-
cists, chemical and mechanical engi-
neers available was assigned to the
project. The story of the manufacture
of nylon will be told next month.
