Teller Talks on Proliteration;
Nuclear Secrecy

Asks No

0 by ALAN msum

At a dinner address to the
American Assembly Friday-
night, internationally famous
nuclear physicist Dr. Edward
Teller discussed various as-
pects of the problem of nu-
clear proliferation, suggest-
ing that this country unclas-

sify non-strategic secrets
concerning the production of nu-
clear weapons, urged the devel-
opment and deployment of an ef-
fective missile defense, and ad-
vocated giving countries like In-
dia purely defensive nuclear
weapons to protect themselves
against possible Chinese threats.

Speaking at Carnegie Tech’s
Skibo Hall, the Hungarian-born
scientist maintained that “the
number one danger is the multi-
plicity of threats. The main meth-
od we have adopted to preserve
stability is being prepared to re-
taliate. I believe it should be our
policy not to strike ﬁrst.”

He pointed out that if there ex-
ists an excess of nuclear powers,
“we might be attacked and not
be sure from where the attack
came.” Another possible result of
proliferation would be “war by
mistake, which becomes more
plausible when the membership
of the nuclear club becomes
great.”

Dr. Teller held that “we must
continue in a dangerous world
to be in a position to retaliate,”
but suggested a modiﬁcation of
present policy which would con-
sist of delaying retaliation until
a better analysis of the situation
could be made.

“We should like to retaliate
--3, with certainty,” he explained,
’ “and a delay should make it pos-

sible to assure retaliation against

the right party. It would elimin-
ate a mistake on our part.” Also,

“a delay will save lives.”

However, Dr. Teller conceded
that there might be “a high price
for delay. We must be strong, so
that we are not destroyed and
our military strength is not

\\’

broken. We are rich and we can
afford to be strong and patient.”

Citing the purported develop-
ment by the Soviets of an effec-
tive ballistic missile defense sys-
tem, Dr. Teller explained that
“the strength I am talking about
includes the development of a
missile defense.” Perceiving Chi-
na as the prime threat, he said,
“We could put up a missile de-
fense strong and effective enough
to deter any Chinese attack.”

Teller maintained that we could
deploy a missile defense “effec-
tive enough so that no one who

is a newcomer to the nuclear
club can threaten us. Looking
at the alternatives, he hypothe-
sized a situation in the early
1970's in which “the Chinese can’t
blackmail the Soviets because the
Russians have a missile defense,
but they can blackmail us.”

This situation he argued would
“disturb the delicate and precari-
ous international balance of pow-
er in a most terrible manner. We
can’t afford to let this happen.”
With a missile defense system,
“proliferation would not be like-
ly to hurt us directly.”

Dr. Teller warned against adopt-
ing a fortress America-type poli-
cy. “If we defend ourselves,” he
said, “andat the same time leave
the free and uncommitted nations
undefended, we will have dan-
gerous consequences. It would be

ACTING CHANCELLOR Dr. David H. Kurtzman was recently tap-
av ped by the Order of Omega, honor society for interfraternity lead-
‘ crship. Seen shaking Dr. Kurtzman’s hand is Ken Frederick (left),

the last nail in the coffin‘ of the
NATO alliance.”

He advocated that we make “a
good missile defense system avail-
able to others,” especially those
countries potentially threatened
by China.

The alternative to this, Teller
feared, would be a situation of
“imagined stability” based on pa-
per promises and “unfulﬁlled
guarantees that led to the ﬁrst
world war.”

He urged giving India, for ex-
ample, nuclear weapons “which
can be used for defense and de-
fense only,” and would be pre-
vented electronically from being
converted to offensive weapons.

He reminded his audience that
at this time nuclear devices and
delivery systems are relatively
inexpensive to make and that
tests are not necessary for their,
development. Countries like In-
dia could very well develop their
own nuclear capabilities if we do
not remove the necessity.

Dr. Teller’s last main point was
prefaced by a quote from Niels;
Bohr. Bohr once advocated abol-
ishing secrecy, that the “right
weep-on a dictatorship is secrecy
and the right weapon of a demo-
cracy is openness.”

Teller maintained that making
public nuclear production secrets
would constitute “a form of uni-
lateral disarmament that would
strengthen us,” adding that “the
Russians probably know all our
secrets anyway.”

While allowing for the neces-
sity of certain tactical secrets, he
said that “in a democracy the
people decide and you can’t make
decisions without facts. If the
people are kept ignorant they
may decide in a wrong manner.”
Teller added /that a policy of
openness would “prevent the ad-
ministration from using secrecy
for the purpose of covering up
their mistakes.”

Proposed Fee To Be 
Impetus For Planning -   

Of New Student Union   

by FRED FRANK , » ;
(See editorial, “Manning and the Student Union,” page four.)
Students have received a promise from the administra-
tion that a new Student Union will be built and a Union:  .
fee will be employed to maintain the new building. Acting ~‘
Chancellor David H. Kurtzman told a group of students
Thursday that the Student Union will be part of the Master‘
Plan to be drawn up in about 12 months. _-
At the meeting in the Chancel-
lor’s office, Student Government
(SG) President Ralph Manning
told the Acting Chancellor of the
passage of an SG bill providing
for a union fee. Dr. Kurtzman re-

    
 

The Acting Chancellor added,
“We deﬁnitely want student opin-
ion about what they want in‘
their Union once we are a little
further along in our plans. We _ g
want the Union to be in the cen-‘
ter of our academic facilities,” he’ 
continued, “and we‘wil1 be able
to see where this will be once "7’?
the Master Plan is complete.”

 

Dr. Kurtzman suggested that 
alumni might donate funds for
the construction of the Union I 
“if we present the package in the; 
right way.” Imaginative student 
fund raising projects could be an- =
other source of support for the 
Union, he said. Dr. Kurtzrnantgjli
predicted that in three years the’;
building could be a reality.

Board that they _have received

Miss Bonney explained, “The
funds available for gifts and en-
dowments will be the same that
the University presently has.” She
implied that because of the Uni-
vex-sity’s state-relatedness, the
amount needed for in-state stu-.
dents will decrease. “Therefore,” I
‘continued Miss Bonney, “there
will be a higher percentage of ‘
gifts and endowments for out-of-
state students.”

Miss Bonney went on to say,
“It is impossible to give any real 4,.
estimate on the increase, since 
next year’s budget, one of the
sources of the scholarships, is un-
known.” She added, “Gifts from
individuals, industry, founda-
tions, and organizations, plus en-
clowments (income from previous _ _, I
contributions) are the two other V 
sources of funds.”  -_

CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS

In an effort to prevent fires, the Build-
ings and Grounds Department requires
that all decorations be flameproof, and
suggests that artificial trees be used
wherever possible. They offer these pre-
cautionary suggestions:

1. Never attach lights to aluminum trees
due to shock hazard.

2. If live trees are used, they must be
sprayed with a flameproofing solution.

3. Adequately support your tree in a
container filled with sand and kept moist
with water. Sand for filling containers
will be available at no charge at the
Cathedral of Learning (containers must
be provided by your office).

4. All tree lights must be turned off
before leaving the building or upon re-
tiring.

5. No candles or other "open flame
type of lighting is permitted.

6. Check all wiring before using and
be sure it is of an approved type and in
good condition.

The Buildings and Grounds Department
will flameproof all trees and cut greens
without charge. Trees and greens to be
paid for by the University must be
requisitioned through the Purchasing of-
fice not later than December 1st. These
will be flameproofed prior to delivery to
you. Arrangements for flameproofing all

_ other trees and greens must be made with

the Buildings and Grounds office, exten-
sion 221. There is no charge for this ser-
oe. _

Manning and the

When the new Student Union is built, somewhere there should

 a little plaque which says, “To Ralph Manning who never let the Stu-

dent Union issue die.” Student Government President (SG) Manning
was certain that something could be done with the problem. Others told
him that the administration would build a Union when it felt like it

 ’ and nothing SG or Ralph Manning would do could help.

But Manning decided to pretty much “go it” on his own and at-
tacked the problem from two angles. First he would work for having
the present facilities (Schenley Hall) cleaned up and second he would
investigate the possibilities for building a new Student Union. While
some might have sat back upon the dubious laurels of just running SG
events such as Homecoming and the Book Exchange, Manning felt that
more was required of the head of the student body.

At a meeting with the Acting Chancellor and a group of student

I leaders last October, Manning presented Dr. Kurtzman with a well docu-

mented and decisive statement about the problems ofthe present Union
and the need for expanded facilities. Out of this meeting came a prom-
ise from the Chancellor that maintenance of Schenley Hall would im-
prove and a suggestion that SG investigate means of ﬁnancing a new
Union. _

The next step was Manning-’s decision that the SG senate should
form a committee to ﬁnd out how a new Student Union could be built.

Student, iUnion

Manning worked with the Student Union Board-’s representative to SG,
Arthur Cohen, one the idea and eventually the Senate passed a bill calling
for such a committee.

A few weeks later, the committee reported back to the Senate that
a Union fee paid by the‘ students would be the best way for the student
body to aid in the construction of a Union. That resolution to this effect
was presented by Manning to the Chancellor the day after the SG meet-
ing. At that time Manning secured a deﬁnite commitment from Dr. Kurtz-
man that the Union fee suggested by SG would be used to maintain a
new student center to be constructed sometime in the next three years,

Manning was lucky in som respects. He found a cooperative ad-

ministrator who was willing to meet with him and listen to his proposals. ‘I
He also got 21 got a lot of help from his fellow SG officers in researching ..

the problem. But no would deny that he led the ﬁght. So often SG passes
milk and toast bill about the prices in the book center, -food service in
the cafeteria, etc. These bills have as many teeth‘ as a user of Polident
and are allowed to sit in a dusty SG ﬁle.

But apparently Ralph Manning doesn’t work this Way. When he
takes on a problem he sticks with it. The passage of the Union fee and
the commitment by the administration for a new student center are ex-
amples of Manning determination.

The 1968 Campaign

Romney For President?
by Linda Goldstein

I

WITH RESULTS from this
year’s elections barely re-
corded key Republican vic-
tors have already turned to
the prospects of choosing a
Republican presidential nom-
inee for 1968.

While vacationing in Puer-
to Rico, this past week-end
New York Governor Nelson
Rockefeller met successively
with Pennsylvania Governor-
elect Raymond P, Shafer and
Michigan Governor George
Romney. There are indica-
tions that a prime conversa-
tion topic was a move to sup-
port Romney for the presi-
dency. This is in line with
Romney’s announcement a
few days ago that he would
take a “long hard look” at
the possibility of contending
for the GOP nomination —
his ﬁrst public statement to
that effect. _

Pennsylvania is already
participating in the “Rom—
ney for President’ movement
by virtue of Governor Wil-
liam Scranton’s secretary,
William G. Murphy. Murphy

conﬁrmed last week his in-.

tentions to join Jack McIn-
tosh, Michigan director of
commerce, as co-director of
a “Romney for President”
organization in Washington.

WHY THE sudden activ-
ity on behalf of Romney? As

The H

  

one Romney supporter com-
mented, “Most delegates who
go to conventions are inter-
ested primarily in picking a
winner. For a Republican to
be a winner nationally, he
must be able to get 90 per
cent of the Republican vote,
65 per cent of the indepen-
dent vote, and 20 to 25 per
cent of the Democratic vote.
That is what Governor Rom-

ney has done in Michigan”,

U. S. News & World Report,
Nov. 21 issue).

In Romney’s overwhelm.-
ing (61 per cent of the votes
cast) victory in the heavily
Democratic state of Michi-
gan, he captured 50 per cent
of the labor vote and 34 per
cent of the Negro vote. The
election results revealed that
Romney’s popularity was
definitely transferable: his
protege, Robert Griffin, won
a sizeable victory over ﬁve-
time Michigan Governor G.
Mennen (Soapy) Williams in

their Senate contest; he also

boosted ﬁve Republican con-
gressional candidates to vic-
tories over Democratic in-
cumbents. This was a re-
sounding answer to Rep,
Melvin Laird (R. —Wiscon-
sin), a Nixon supporter, who
months ago had remarked
that if Romney could pull
Griffin through, the 1968

Editor, The Pitt News:

The new steps taken by the
Collegiate Association of Pitts-
burgh (CAP) should deserve a
hearty welcome by the students.

The organization’s aims are truly \}
praiseworthy. “A Smart Student 1

Shopper’s Board” is doing a great
job. I think that the Board should
also go into other areas _besides
c1othing——such as——discounts in
movie theatres, laundries and in
other commodities used by the
students. I believe, an organiza-
tion such as CAP, can accom-
plish these. I gave my full sup-
port to the CAP and I am of the
opinion that it deserves the supr-
port from all the Student Gov-
ernment senates of the CAP
member schools and all the stu-
dents.

by GEORGE LIES

Dave Hart shrugged his shoulders and sighed. The Pan-
ther football season was over, and Penn State had added salt
to the wound in a 48-24 shellacking last Saturday.

The game started as had every game this year. The
Panthers were behind early and were forced to play catch-
up. Before quarterback Ed James could throw his 21 com-
pletions, the Nittany Lions sat on a 33-0 lead. And it took
everything the Cat defense knew to keep the score under

the half-century mark.

“It’s been the story of our
year,” Hart said. “We give them
two touchdowns and we have to
play catch-up football.

“We haven’t gone by our game
plan all year,” Hart continued.
“We never got a chance to exe-
cute it.”

The big play in the Lions’ vari-
ed attack was a deep reverse.
Most of the time the handoff
went to wingback Bob Campbell,
a sophomore who was _a school-
boy All—American. Most of the
time, it caught the Panther de-
fense napping; napping enough
for Campbell to gain 137 yards
on 14 carries and increase his
yards-per-carry from a 6.3 to a
7.2 average.

“We’ve seen that play before
and it was nothing new to our
boys,” said Hart. “It’s just that
we can’t run.”

Campbell scored three touch-
downs. His big play came when
he broke through right tackle and
ran 41 yards to the end zone.

In the light of Campbell’s ef-
forts, Bob Longo’s late-stage hero-
ics almost went unnoticed. Longo
caught seven passes to just break.
the school record of 45 recep-
tions in a single season. Eric
Crabtree established the mark
last season.

“We thought Longo could get
the record and we tried to throw
to him purposely,” Hart said.

Passing to Longo also came as
a matter of necessity because the
Panther ground game ran in low
gear, or almost in reverse. It
gained 54 yards; it lost 45 yards.

Underclassmen Dominate

, Booters End Season, Beat State

by MIKE BROURMAN
“This is just like winning
the ﬁrst one next year.”

With that comment, soccer
coach Leo Bemis summed up the
hooters’ 2-1 victory over Penn
State at Forbes Field on Satur-
day.

For the seniors, it was their
last game in Pitt uniforms, and
they played “a real determined
game,” said Bemis. But, it was
the efforts of the juniors and
sophomores which got the boot-
ers their fourth victory of the
season.

When junior‘ rover GaI'y Foer-
tsch scored the game winning
goal with a little more than ten
minutes left in the contest, there
were eight sophomores and jun-

‘iors in the booter lineup. “It was,
' a second team victory,”

com-
mented captain Art Richardson,
one of the graduating seniors,
“they won it for us.”

Foertsch’s goal broke a 1-1 tie
that had existed since the ﬁrst
period of the hard fought game.

Sal Tavares gave the booters
an early lead, taking a pass from
fellow senior Al Traunsteiner,
and beating the Penn State goalie.

Bob Gettlerman tied the score
for State some seven minutes

I: . later, when he beat goalie Len

Harmon on a breakaway. The
hooters dominated the action the

these seniors,” said Bemis. “They
may be disappointed" because of
our record, but they can always
be proud of beating a great rival
like Penn State. And, it’s nice to
see the way the underclassmen
played. I think they are going to
bring us a winner next year.”

and scored the ﬁrst touchdown.

Longo caught a James pass for
another score as did Gerry Rife
and Joe Jones.

“It was a long afternoon,” Hart
said. “I wasn’t looking forward
to the end of the season, but
again we were just battling-for
respectability out there.”

When Penn State students tore
down the goal posts at the end of
the game, there weren’t many of
the 30,362 chilled spectators re-
maining in the stands.

And about the onlyperson who
gave them anything to cheer
about was quarterback James. He
threw for 283 yards on 21 of 46
passes, bettering his marks of the
UCLA game (137; 15-22) and the
Duke game (205; 15-30).

What James could have done
this season with more experience
in his sophomore and junior
years will never be known.

did he merely prove that favor-

This question is currently be-

any decision that esteemed body
