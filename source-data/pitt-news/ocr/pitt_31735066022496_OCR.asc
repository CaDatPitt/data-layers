End of an era

Final Pitt-Penn State home game draws ixed emotin

By Brett Gilrnan
For The Pitt News

Since Penn State is entering the Big Ten and Pitt
is now in the Big East Football Conference, the
rivalry between the two schools is coming to a
close. The final game being played in Pittsburgh
between Pitt and Penn State brought mixed
reactions from students at both schools.

Because of the recent successes of Penn State
and the disappointments of Pitt football, many
Penn State fans don't see the rivalry as a big deal..

“When we play Notre Dame, there is an intense
atmosphere on campus with lots of partying and
concern about the game. It just isn't that way
when we play Pitt,” Penn State junior Allison
Farber said.

Judy Wagner, a Penn State junior, agrees that
the game has lost something. “Since Pitt is not
ranked and because we are entering the Big Ten,
the rivalry doesn’t mean much.”

Not all Pitt fans are excited about the game.

Pitt junior Adam Siegelhiem said the game is
insignificant.

“I won’t be shedding any tears that the rivalry
is ending next year. This game is just another
chance for Pitt to prove that they're a national
embarrassment,” he said.

Other fans disagree. Jim Brinling, a brother of
Phi Gamma Delta at Pitt, can’t wait for the game.

‘Even though Pitt hasn’t performed so well this
season, a win for Pitt would be like a major bowl
victory, he said. “It’s what the Pitt football season

Cold weather and a little snowfall didn’t scare away_ the diehard
fans who gathered in Schenley Quad last night and dorm residents
who hung out their windows to “get psyched” and show their
support for the Panthers.

The Pitt-Penn State rivalry continues this year with an 11:15
kickoff on Thanksgiving Day in a game which may be the last one
in which Pitt Stadium plays host to this long—celebrated tradition.

Pitt’s cheerleaders led the crowd in stirring up spirit and tried to
convince everyone that the snow and freezing temperatures are all ’
a part of what is considered real football weather.

Athletic Director Oval Jaynes and football coach Paul Hackett
expressed their thanks to the students for their support of the team
throughout the year.

r=- Children’s Hospital staff member
tested positive for HIV infection

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor ,

A Children’s Hospital staff
member has tested positive for
HIV, but there seems to have
been no risk to patients or other
employees, hospital spokes-
people said yesterday.

The empl ‘lee, a non-physician
member of the operating-room
staff, is now seriously ill and is no
longer dealing with patients,
according to Lynn McMahon at
Children’s public relations. The
hospital will not release the name

or title of the infected person.
Between June 1990 and
November 1991, the staff member

' had been present during 1,000

surgical cases. But a staff review
of all surgical records showed
that no “incidents, such as a glove
puncture” occurred that would
“constitute a risk for transmission
of HIV,” said hospital medical
director Dr. William Donaldson.

McMahon said families of_

patients present during operations
attended by the staff member will
be notified of the risk.

The Centers for Disease Control

and county and state health
departments also reviewed the
situation and found there was
little to no risk of exposure.

“We were encouraged with the
meticulous data available through
Children’s Hospital’s surgical
records  that allowed us to
conduct [an] extensive, in—depth
review,” said Dr. Bruce Dixon,
chief of the STD/AIDS program
in the Allegheny County Health
Department.

Children’s has set up an
information line at 692-7500 or 1-
800-647-5437.

When Bonnie Larsontook her gay son and his lover out to
dinner for the first time, she was worried everyone in the
restaurant “saw ‘gay’ written right across our foreheads.”

But Larson, a member of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and
Gays, said participating in PFLAG helped her deal with her son
coming out. She described her initial reaction to her son’s

V homosexuality as “devastated, is the only word I could give you.

“As accepting as I felt I was, when it hit my own family, the
reaction is very different  You need someone who’s going
through the same thing you are to share with,” Larson said.

Holidays raise church and state separation issue

By Mark Smith
Staff Writer

Pittsburgh winters, with their
chilling winds and festive merry-
making, have a new traditional
seasonal element. Every year
about this time, the city of
Pittsburgh, the pro-separation of
church and state community, the
pro—religious—displaycommunity
and the American Civil Liberties
Union square off in a holiday
scuffle. The issue is religious
displays on public property.

’l'empers rise when the holiday-
display issues surface each winter.
Some people assert their rights
are violated by not having
displays. Others cite the First
Amendment forbidding
government advancement of
religion. Further conﬂict could
erupt if members of the Church
of Satan request an display.

To help answer some basic
questions concerning church and
state involvement, Know Your
Rights dedicates this special
holiday column to the religious

wars fought in Pittsburgh, Islam,
Ireland, India/Pakistan and all
other regions in conﬂict over
belief.

Question: Does the phrase
“separation of church and
state” appear in the United
States Constitution?

Answer: No. The phrase does
not appear in the Constitution.
The First Amendment reads,
“Congress shall make no law

respecting the establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.” This is more
commonly referred to as the
Establishment Clause. As with
other aspects of American
constitutional law, the First
Amendment provisions have
changed with time. This is what
is meant by the U.S. Constitution
as a living document. It is able to
adapt with the times. A “right to
travel” or “freedom of association”
does not appear in the
Constitution either, and both have
an established legal history.
The phrase appears in an
important 1947 Supreme Court
case, Everson vs. Board of
Education. Here, the Supreme
CourtadoptedThomasJefferson’s
view of a “wall of separation
between church and state.” The
view is simple: ‘Government
cannot set up one or many
religions, pass laws to aid one or
all religions, force or prevent a
person from attending a church,
tax people to support church
activities or punish a person for a

belief. A

Q: Where do church and state
separation ideas originate in
the law?

A: Separation has its roots in
religious conﬂicts. In colonial
times, the Puritans of
Massachusetts left‘ England
escaping religious discrimination.
Once in America, they set up a
theocratic state and forced other
religious sects to leave. Catholics
leaving founded Maryland and
setu p a theocractic colony forcing
Protestants to leave. Andthe story
goes on. It can be best discerned
that the constitutional framers
sought to avoid these
controversies.

Q: Under church and state
separation, can school
children pray in school?

A: Yes. It would probably be a
constitutional violation if public
school personnel forced children
not to pray. In the early 1960s,
the Supreme Court handed down
two significant decisions. It
concluded that public schools

By Ross Pasquale
The Pitt News

“One of the luckiest people in the
world,” is how Anne Levenson, associate
dean ofthe College of General Studies and
chair of the Provost’s Advisory Committee
for \X/omen’s Concerns, chooses to sum
up her existence.

Levenson placed her college years in
context with the women’s movement in
the 19505. She attended the all—female
Smith College in Massachusetts, receiving
a bachelor’s degree in education in 1954.

The famous, deceased poet Sylvia Plath
was among her classmates, and feminist
author Gloria Steinem was one year her
senior. It was common at this time for
women to graduate from college and
marry, with few exceptions to this rule.

Levenson followed this trend, and after
her three children were born, she became
heavily ‘involved in volunteer work.
“Traditionally, [volunteering] had been a
way that women had had an impact on the
community, while not working for money.”
At this time, Levenson was involved with
the Head Start program in Pittsburgh.

Eventually, Levenson returned to her.

Anne Levenson

education and obtained a master’s degree
in social work from Pitt in 1972. She had
been a staff social worker at Arsenal
Family and Children’s Center for a year
before joining the staff of CGS as an
assistant to the dean.

She calls the child-care situation at Pitt
‘a “major issue” and commends the Child

Care Coalition for what she calls f“an

. impressive job,” and for understanding
' the complexities of the situation.

“Financial, I think, is a major point of
view [in child care]. Look at our resources,
look at all the areas in which resources are
requested faculty salaries, student health
care, student financial aid, campus security

. there are millions of things that need

5 money. Is child care something that

university money should go to? How would
students feel about that? I don’t know the
answers. I don't know how it’ll play out.
I don’t know how it sbould play out. I do
know that our country sadly under-invests
in our children, “ Levenson said.

Her own childhood was spent injersey
City, N.]., where she often left on Saturdays
for a 20-minute ride into Manhattan. “My
mother never thought twice about sending
me alone into the city  and living in
Pittsburgh has been wonderful. I think
there are so many opportunities, and
they’re accessible. The convenience, the
safety, everything they say about Pittsburgh
— it’s been quite marvelous.”

Public safety, which has concerned much
of Oakland’s population oflate, is another
topic that Levenson reflected upon. “I

wouldn’t think twice about walking to the
[Pittsburgh] Playhouse when I lived in
Oakland a few years back. Pittsburgh is
such a safe place  but things happen.
Things happen everywhere. I’m not a
fearful person  This new incidence about
publishing crime reports is very interesting.
Now, I would absolutely feel comfortable
at midnight in Forbes Quad. It wouldn’t
occur to me that that wouldn’t be a
comfortable, safe place to be. It turned out
for one young woman to be a very
dangerous place, and that’s a very hard
thing to deal with. I mean, that could have
been my child. It could have been me 
It’s hard to protect against the
unpredictable, it’s just so hard.”

Her professional success hasn’t been
terribly difficult, however. She said that
she came to CGS in 1973 due to a “series
of coincidences." She started there as an
assistant to the dean, and her duties
included overseeing off-campus sites,
admissions, recruitment and marketing.

She completed her doctoral work in
education in 1983, also the yearshe became
associate dean and a founding member of
PACWC. Her duties as associate dean

Easing stress of finals

By Leon Fuksman
stag Writer

It's midnight the night before your first final. You feel the stress
beginning to build as you realize you still have 500 pages of your
psych book to read. Desperately you start slurping down coffee,
hoping it will keep you awake.

But your study tactics might backﬁre.

According to Mary Early, an intern at Pitt’s counseling center,
caffeine interferes with studying and retention and can lead to
more stress.

Instead ofdepending on stimulants, Early suggests taking study
breaks away from the books in another environment.

“Of course there is no substitute for a good night’s sleep, but
if you must study late, find some time for relaxing on a couch,
walking around or even getting some fresh air,” she said.

A U.S. Department of Health Education report suggests that
students periodically take several deep breaths to help reduce
stress while studying.

According to the report, heavy breathing enriches the body's
supply of oxygen and allows the mind to forget about any

have expanded to include
overseeing Pitt’s Informal
Program, Continuing Education
for Women and the Office of
Conference Coordination.

The needs of CGS students are

different from those of other’

students, mainly in the amount of
time that is available to them.
Many of them have full-time jobs
and need the admissions,
registration and advising centers
of CGS to be open for extended
hours.

Levenson also said, with a
laugh, that a CGS student would
call “parking” one of his or her
greatest needs. She also recalled
that her favorite compliment from
a CGS student in regard to the
availability and ease of the college
was, “It was never this easy at

Penn State.”

She isn’t sure of the exact
obstacles she's faced from being
a woman in the work force,
because she said that obstacles
would have been more noticeable
if she had had a goal in mind.

“I would have been able to
measure if I had gotten there or
not, and when I had gotten there
 I think I’ve been very fortunate
to be where I am. I’m sure there
have been obstacles, but I just
haven’t pushed up against them.
I’ve probably just gone around
them or shrugged them off,
probably gotten more assertive
with age.

"You’re not as vulnerable to
the putdowns; I think maybe
people are getting more careful,

I don’t know. I hear plenty of

horror stories still.”

Levenson said that the influence
of PACWC may have been most
evident in the university sexual
harassment policy, for which the
committee made a large
contribution.

The committee also presents a
workshop to untenured women
entitled “Navigating the Tenure
Stream.”

The committee also had the
opportunity to interview the five
presidential finalists, which she
notes as a good opportunity for
the presidential candidates,
including President J. Dennis
O’Connor, to see that “we exist,
we are here. I think that there will
always be a need for such
organizations to exist as long as
there are constituencies that feel
under—represented and under-
fulfilled.”

Rally

Continued from page 1

Coach Hackett hailed this as
the “big game” and stressed how
all students are needed to
contribute to beat Penn State.

The Pitt-Penn State rivalry
began in 1895, and in the last
four games each team has two
victories. Hackett introduced the
senior squad and said a victory
Thursday will allow the seniors
to be 3-2 against Penn State.
“That’s what it's all about,”
Hackett said.

“It’s easier to go out there and
play our hearts out when we

- know you’re 100 percent behind

us,” said Captain Sean Gilbert.

“I don’t know about all of
you, but I’m not cold because I
have so much adrenaline
flowing,” he said.

Gilbert will be looking for
everyone on Thanksgiving Day
when the Panthers “will have
lions for turkeys.”

Co—Captain Eric Seaman told
the crowd how much Penn State
hates coming to Pitt Stadium to
play. ~

“They’re not just playing us —
they’re playing everyone,” he
said.

Debz I Kavaler, Student
Government Board spirit
chairman, and SGB President
Brent Saunders coordinated the
rally.

Kavaler opened it with, “Show
the team how psyched you can
get to kick Penn State’s ass.”

Both Kavaler and Saunders said

they are sorry to see one of

Pennsylvania’s greatest rivalries
coming to an end.

“Rivalries are healthy and keep
up spirit,” Kavaler said. “I hate to
see politics end a celebrated
tradition.”

President Dennis J. O’Connor
was unable to attend, but Coach
Hackett delivered a clear message
for O’Connor by leading the
students in the P-I—T—T cheer.

Hackett and the Panther team
thanked all “of their true friends
out there” for their support and
spirit and look forward to
T hursday’s game.

she fears her lesbian daughter
will be discriminated against,
discussed PFLAG with about
25 students at a Bisexual, Gay
and Lesbian Alliance meeting
last night.

Parents of gays and lesbians
are concerned that they won’t
have grandchildren, Larson

V said, and they also worry about
their children facing job
discrimination and anti-
homosexual violence.

Maurene said she is
“impressed that the parents who

come to the meetings love their
children so much.”

Although parents may love
their children, they are often
shocked when their children
come out as gays or lesbians.
Accepting her gay son was the
“end of my dreams and the
realization that he has his dreams
too,” Larson said.

Parents need to re-evaluate
their perspectives on homo-
sexuality before they can be
comfortable with their gay and
lesbian children, Larson and
Maurene said.

“We all live in this homophobic
society,” Maurene said.

‘‘We’ve all been sold a bill of
goods that’s really not true. We
all have to reassess this
information that we’ve been
bombarded with,” she said.

Learning more about the
lesbianand gay community with
her daughter taught Maurene
about the “extent of range of
human sexuality. There’s so
much more than anybody can
ever imagine.”

They counseled students
coming out to their parents to

“give your parents time. That’s
essential. You didn't know and
come to terms with yourself
overnight.”

It is also important to set
limits about what parent and
child feel comfortable talking
about, she said.

“It wasn’t fine initially, but it
was fine once I processed the
information,” Larson said. “Now
I’ve had five years to think
about it.”

Both women said they now
come out as parents of
homosexual children.

F fkepresentation, finally

The Pitt administration has long been criticized for its
“top-down” policy-making system. In 1988, Provost
Rudolph Weingarten resigned because then-President
Wesley Posvar wouldn’t give him any authority over the
budget.

Although Pitt President}. Dennis O’Connor has recently
been accused of reneging on his promise of an “era of
openness,” he took a step forward at last Friday’s Board
of Trustees meeting.

- O’Connor announced that a student representative
would be included on the committee to decide the
guidelines of the University of Pittsburgh’s budget for the
fiscal year 1994.

The committee will consist of administrators, faculty, a
staff member and a student. Although the College
of General Studies Student Government Council does not
feel that a student representative is necessary, Student
Government Board President Brent Saunders said he feels
it is imperative that a student is on a committee at that
level.

“Why would you take away a voice when you finally get
a voice?” Saunders said. -

According to O’Connor’s plan, university “responsibility
centers” will create budget requests and submit them to
the Office of Budget, which will, in turn, summarize the
information and pass it on to the planning and budget
committee. The committee will then review the requests
and pass them on to O’Connor, who will finalize the
committee’s decisions and inform the “responsibility
centers” of denials and/or approvals.

Although somewhat intricate, O’Connor’s plan will
provide an opportunity for more than just the administration
to make budgetary decisions. The plan satisfies students
in more than one way. Not only will it educate us
concerning Pitt funding, but it will also give the
administration more time to concentrate on the educational
aspects of Pitt —— something it has been known to ignore
in the past.

Hopefully, the decision to place a student on this vital
committee will prove to be very positive. Although a
decision cannot yet be made as to whether or not the
committee will be effective, at least we will have more
input than we have ever been offered before.

O’Connor said, “My full intent is to keep [the budget
process] as open and as public as possible and include all
sectors of our community.” A

During the reign of ex-Pitt President Wesley Posvar,
student input was not held in high regard. The Pitt budget
is something we, as students, must acknowledge. Our
tuition money contributes to the (minimal) allowances
from the state of Pennsylvania, and it is then divided up
among the many departments of the university.

We have a right to know where our money is going and
why it is being spent. llopefully, with this new
representation, we will not be left out in the cold for much
longer

Voter apathy becoming extreme

The election in Louisiana is over, and the citizens ’
of that grand state will not be graced with the
presence of ex-Nazi (so he says) David Duke in the
governor’s mansion. People everywhere are
wondering how the former grand dragon of the Ku

a lever in a voting booth every four years or so
(which we do at virtually the lowest rate of any
democratic republic in the world anyway).

.Democracy demands an informed citizenry that

bothers, in some meager way, to keep up with the

Klux Klan could have gotten so

far. Mark
Carlin

The concern is not just about
David Duke but about the whole

issues and maintain some form of
spirited debate. Unfortunately, we
can’t be bothered. We are too
busy watching reruns of

political process. Over and over
again, we see pandering, self—serving, venal
politicians whose sole interests are getting into and
staying in office. They promise one thing and do
the exact opposite. They lie with such regularity it
is now assumed that, like lawyers, any honest

utterance is the rare exception to the norm. Nothing v

substantive seems to get done by government —
any government — federal, state or local.

So who’s to blame? Many are convinced it’s the _

politicians. They are just a bunch of lying, corrupt
hypocrites trying to get their hands in the public
trough. Nothing can be done about it because it is
the nature of the beast. Others say the whole
political system stinks. It has slowly been corrupted
so that now only money, power and inﬂuence have
any meaning in politics. Still others say it’s the
media. How can anyone keep up ‘with the
shenanigans in government when all we get is
“World News in a Minute” or comic books like USA
Today pretending to be newspapers? (1 love those
bold and controversial headlines, like “U.S.A. loves
ice cream” or “U.S.A. daffy over Dynasty”) There
are many who point to slick campaign advertising
which doesn’t deliver issues or ideas, just warm
fuzzies or vile mudslinging. These are but a sampling
of the many complaints commonly made.

The suggested solutions generally come in one of
two varieties: Reform the system or “Vote the bums
outta office.” Currently the favorite option among
the reformers is term limits, otherwise known as the
Stop me before I vote againinitiative, which just failed
in Washington state. Another approach for reformers
is election reform, usually based on trying to limit
the effect of political—action committees, special-
interest lobbies or anyone who can lavish great
sums of money on an eager—to—please candidate.
Reformers are also interested in finding some way
to regulate the kind of advertising a candidate may
use.

The nonreform-based approach is even simpler:
Just vote all the incumbents (bums) out. Every

election we hear this one, and every election we «

keep electing the same goons to office. These
solutions remind me ofa great H. L. Menken quote
which I will paraphrase: Every problem has one
solution which is simple, easy, clear and wrong.
We can look all we want to find someone or
something else to blame, but ultimately the blame
rests with us. We have forgotten that democracy is
not simply a system of governance or political
philosophy but a way oflife. It is more than pulling

“Gilligan’s Island” or the latest
Schwarzenegger slaughterfest to read a real
newspaper or open the pages of a magazine of

public affairs. The fact is the media, the candida_tes_,_

and the campaign experts are giving us exactly
what we want: little substance, lots of pretty-
pictures and under no circumstances anything that _
might ask us to think. ‘ - '

I have heard that keeping up with the issuesis
hard and confusing. That is only partly true. The
issues can be confusing, but nobody said democracy
was neat. It is our job to sort out the issues as well
as we can. Spending a little time each week is not
too hard a task. The rest of the world does not
regard it as such hard work. Germany's version of
Time or Newsweek is called Der Spiegel and is
normally four to five times thicker than our major
news Weeklies. Citizens of almost any other
developed country are much better informed on
U.S. affairs than most Americans.

The fact is that if we read more and did a better
job keeping up on the relevant issues confronting
the country, most of the other problems would not
be very important. For instance, the media is like
every other business in America and is just trying to
make a buck. If we demanded moreand better
news, we would get it. But the networks and
newspapers know if they offer more than world
news in a minute, we turn to see what Kojak is
doing tonight-. If we paid real attention to our
elected officials and held them accountable for
their actions, they would act more responsibly, if
for no other reason then to get votes. If we voted
better, we would get better representation. To pass
legislation that would set term limits is to surrender
our responsibility to vote intelligently and to admit
that the American public can not handle the
fundamental obligation of a democracy.

I don’t pretend that an informed and involved
citizenry is a panacea. Those with power and
influence will always be able to exert more pressure
than those without power. The poor and
disadvantaged will always be weak, but a better
informed public is a more compassionate public
and is better able to counteract abuses of power. It
is time we quit looking for excuses and someone
else to blame and admit that we are the problem.
Things won’t get better until we accept the blame
and find in ourselves the will to live and act
democratically.

is all about.”

Jennifer Gobrecht, a junior,
would also like to see the game
go on.

“This is my first Pitt—Penn State
game and unfortunately my last.
I would really like to see it
continue.”

While the rivalry may have lost
something, there are some Pitt
and Penn State students who are
sorry to see it end.

Penn State Student President
Mark Stewart is upset about the
ending rivalry. “The rivalry is a
great tradition, not just for Pitt
and Penn State, but for the whole
state of Pennsylvania. I’ll be sorry
to See it end next year.”

Pitt Student Government Board
President Brent Saunders said he
is also sorry to see the tradition
end. It will have a negative
impact for the entire state and
students and alumni will miss it,
he Said. “On the practical side,
the game creates a lot of revenue
for both schools, and losing that
will hurt too.” V

Like a lot of Pitt students,
Saunders has many friends at
Penn State and thinks that besides
the competition between the
teams on the field, the game has
become a competition for him
and his friends.

But the ending ofa rivalry can
have its beneﬁts also, according
to Saunders. Since much of the
school spirit here is vented on
Penn State, “with Penn State now
out of our schedule, the school
spirit here at Pitt can be turned
into one of a pro-Pitt attitude,
rather than an anti—Penn State
one ”

‘problems.

Another tip from the report is
to stop studying an hour before
the test. Seeing Something you
don’t know at the last minute
could Set off anxiety. Spend the
last hour relaxing and doing
something unrelated to the test.

Early agreed with the report-
“Studying up to the last minute
will make people more anxious,
and that could make them forget
what they learned.”

Kay Wilson, a graduate assistant
at the Student Health Service,

recommends the deep—breathing ,__ ,

technique before entering the
classroom and before reading
through the exam.

After arriving at the test site, do
not talk about the test with other
students, who might mention a
problem you neglected to learn.
That could cause you to panic
and forget what you studied,
Wilson said.

In addition, Early recommends
eating a good breakfast before
the exam with foods rich in
protein (cereal, eggs, juice) “The
brain gets energy from the body, .

and if it’s working on an empty » ‘

stomach, it’s not able to work at
top efficiency,” she said.
According to Wilson, the best
way to reduce stress is to plan
beforehand the amount of time
needed to study for the test.

Reportedly, when the casting for
The Addams Family began, Cher was
interested in playing Morticia.
Interested, that is, until she read the
script. Smart woman.

For all the hype, the Hammer
soundtrack and the $33 million price
tag, the script is what makes The
(Addams Family the biggest
disappointment of the year. '

This movie is confusing; the cast is
terrific. Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia,

A full-blown, metallic, three-
ring circus is right around the
corner, destined to bounce
your head off a few walls,
while yourears gasp for breath
and your eyes bulge and
contract in and out of your
damaged skull. What?

lihh, drop the corny,
overstated, “this has never
happened to me” descriptions
and move your booty out to
the Penn Hills for a mammoth, thrce—band tilt.
Yeah, it’s metal all right: No glam, all slam rawk
with a lot of roll (ing Rock). Good ol’ American-
bred stompin’ with Raleigh's Corrosion Of
Conformity, Boston’s Bullet Lavolta and New
York heroes Prong. While these bands are
enjoying success thanks to large recording deals
nowadays, there were days when things were
much simpler for all ofthese bands. As the metal
explosion launched into the pop rocket (which
has given us the wonders of Extreme and
Nelson), many hardballers enjoyed success on
college radio. While commercial rat—y-oh was
ignoring their talent, the college shows were
lapping at them like they were orange push-up
pops. As a gosh darn matter 0' fact, all three of
these pounders got their start on‘the collegiate
airwaves. This is only a subtle plug for college
radio and a major plug for the big trio show at
the City Limits.

Corrosion Of Conformity, or C.().C., has been
around the block. Formed in June of 1982, it
wasn’t until February of '84 that C.O.C. had
something on wax. It was entitled [Eye For/in Eye
and showed the band’s raw punk and ‘political
side. By 1985 and the second LP, Animosity,

Tommy Victor, Ted Parsons and Troy Gregory of Prong.

  

hardcore punk sounds with a
metal feel, something that
hadn’t really been done yet
but which has reached an out-
of-control state these days.
Since then the band has gone

through various lineup
changes, a hiatus, a breakup
and other unstabilizing
elements, all of which have
brought them back into focus
with a new lineup and a new
album, Blind, which guitarist
Pepper Keenan described as a
“blatant endorsement of race-
mixing revolution, tha assassination of right-
wing public officials and hearing loss.” So why
not? They are a touring machine (when together),
and they're on the right side of the law.

Bullet Lavolta crashed onto the scene with Tbe

O

Gzﬂ, a generous 1989 offering from the Boston- .

based Taang! label. A deep, pulsing member full
of crushing guitars and Yukki Gipe’s howling.
Since then (they also released an EP earlier on
Taang!) the Bullet has taken off, scoring a live EP
on Metal Blade that features a cover of Kiss’
“Detroit Rock City,” a song that everyone seems
to talk about when they mention Bullet Lavolta.
Now the Beantowners got vinyl out courtesy of

the mega-RCA label under the ironic title Swan '

Dive. The name comes from the poet Marianne
Moore, who suggested the name to Henry Ford
for a new car he was developing. Who cares?
Lavolta will be loud and bruising, so request
“Over Your Shoulder.”

And then came Prong. Spawned from the
minimal Swans comes a trio of such density and
power itseems damn near schizophrenic. Formed
in 1986 with Tommy Victor at the mike and on
the geetar and Ted Parsons poundin’ skins and
Mike Kirkland on bass, the group released a self-

BAD Michael

   

is back

and he’s ‘Dangerous?’

Michael Jackson
Dangerous
Epic Records

Ever since. the phenomenal
success of Michael Jackson’s
landmark album Thriller, the
world has placed a heavy burden

on him. Every move he makes is.

under the view of the public
microscope. This scrutiny didn’t
apply only to his art; it pertained
to his private life also. From the
infamous sleep chamber to the

buying of the Elephant Man’si

bones, these events made the
news even when the music didn’t.

' It must be extremely difficult to
be Jackson, the musician. The
public in general can’t or won’t
separate his behavior from his
art. So with each video, each
song, the music isn’t only
critiqued, so are his actions. But
when you get to the basics, it’s
the music that matters. The
irrelevancy of his skin color or his
new pal Macaulay Culkin aren’t
important when listening to"his

first release since 1987’s Bad. It’s
called Dangerous.

Ofcourse when you’re a star of
Jackson’s magnitude, all eyes are
watching. Perhaps he’s
acknowledging this dissection
because the only image you’ll
find of him are his eyes staring at
us on the cover. But this is good
because maybe people will enjoy
the music without a visual bias. I
know this is nearly impossible,
but I will do my best to review
just the music and only the music.

As I popped the Dangerous
CD into my player last week, I
highly anticipated a slamming
intro jam that would define the
album. What I got instead was
“Jam," which hardly did that.
Teddy Riley of Guy, who co-
wrote and co—produced half of
the CD’s 14 songs, merely
submerges Jackson with an
overproduced, substandard Guy
throwaway. Luckily this lame
pseudo—funky track is nothing
like the other tracks.

nu 1_>n'r NEWS, Tuesday, November 26, 1991‘

However the next track, “Why
You Wanna Trip On Me,” ﬁnds
Jackson at his most politically
correct, speaking about school
teachers “who 'don’t wanna
teach,” “police brutality” and
“strange diseases. ”Jackson didn’t
write the lyrics to “Trip,” but it
hardly matters, as he sings animal
tough over a mid—tempo, new-
jack groove. But basically he’s
asking why, with all the problems
in the world, the public wants to
“trip” on him.

Jackson’s disgust at how he’s
treated and taken advantage of
pops up on several other tracks.
For instance, “Who Is It?” and the
title track both tackle similar
ground with that girl you can’t
trust but can’t resist. The former
has Jackson “lying” to himself
about the woman who he thought
could fulfill him, but who only
left him without explanation. This
song is the perfect companion

‘piece to “Dirty Diana” in both

style and lyrics minus the heavy
metal guitars.
The latter song, “Dangerous,”

which closes the CD, features
whisper verses like “Justify My
Love” and builds and sustains
with a chorus about a “dangerous”
girl who blinded him with “lust”
and took away his “money.”
Inviting yet defensive, this is the
track that defines Jackson’s
paranoia.

But it’s “She Drives Me Wild”
that defines the sound of the
album. This song findsJackson at
his “Beat It” and “Billie Jean”
best.

A genuine ass-shaker that grabs
you from start to finish without a
pause. It’s new jack and then
some with a percolating beat that
weaves in and out of the cryptic,
you-got-it—and-I-want-it lyrics.
The lines “she composition/she
statistical fact” don’t make any
damn sense, but they get the
point across: She’s driving M.J.

‘wild. This song will rule the

airwaves (deservedly so) because
it’s a definite classic—to-be. '

MichaelJackson album ifit didn’t
contain the obligatory let’s—go—

on-a-save—the—world—crusade
anthem. Guess what? It’s here
and entitled “Heal the World.”
You pretty much know what the
song is about from the title, and
we’ve heard it all before. No,
really. We have heard it all before
in a song — “We Are the World.”
While this ballad features
Jackson’s voice at its most delicate
and beautiful form, its a rip-off.

From the melody of the chorus to .

the lyrics “make a better place/
for you and for me,” it’s been
done before. But it’s a decent
song nonetheless.

Other than “Jam," which was
weak, “Can’t Let Her Get Away”
is the most pathetic. The song is
pure filler that could have been

 

omitted and only breaks the
album’s flow. The title is repeated
about as much as an M.C. Hammer
(excuse me, Hammer) rap (not).
Even the generic music can’t help
the repetitive lyrics.

By now we’ve all heard the
preview single “Black Or White.”
More ofa single guitar riffthan an
actual song, it’s still catchy despite
the amateurish, unneeded rap.
Hardly a great leadoff to
Dangerous, but do you remember
the other Jackson songs that
preceded his previous releases:
“I Just Can’t Stop Loving You”
and “The Girl Is Mine?” Well then

Next to "She Drives Me Wild,”
the other contender for the best
song is ‘‘In the Closet.” Benefitting
from the breathy vocals of
“Mystery Girl” (perhaps the
rumored Madonna), “Closet” is a
relationship song— a relationship
where bothJackson and “Mystery
Girl” love each other, but she
wants everyone to know while
he would prefer to “keep it in the
closet.” A steady beat that gets

 

deeper in the refrain and
emotional vocals take uneven
love to its edge with Jackson’s

final words: “Dare Me.” Six
minutes of hesitation — love at
its finest.

So today the wait is over, and
everyone is looking to see if
Michael Jackson will rise to the
challenges of his detractors. While
Off 7he Wall hinted at the

brilliance of Thriller and Bad '

attempted to maintain the glow
of it, Dangerous breaks no new
ground. it’s still a highly enjoyable
release and must—own for any
fan, but it will inevitably be
compared to his past. If a new
artist would have released this,
everyone would be screaming
“artist of the year.” However a
new artist didn’t: Michael J. did.
Thus Dangerous will be judged

against the lofty heights of his
musical history.

In my opinion this is a solid A-
release containing only two
mediocre tracks. Buy it before
you get tired of hearing it.

in The Kiss of the Spider Woman.

The makeup and scenery are
impressive, and I the
cinematography is above average.
There are some great parts in the
movie, many coming from
Wednesday Addams, played by
Christina Ricci, including a scene

where she is playing a game with
Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) called
“Is there a‘God?” Unfortunately,
those moments are usually 15
minutes apart. , '

I What it comes down to is, as
Cher apparently noticed, the script
stinks. The plot is amazingly lame
for a multimillion dollar movie.
The main problem is that it isn’t

funny enough.

The script seems so interested-
in the characters that it forgets
that what makes the Addams
family so funny is the way they
interact with other people. The
actors do their best with the
material given to them, but they
cannot keep the movie from
sinking below par.

What made The Addams
Family even more disappointing
is the six months that most fans of
the Addams family waited for the
release of the movie.

Charles Addams created the
Addams family in a series of
cartoons. He made around 1,300,

TV series came about in the '60s,
and its syndicated reruns have
been a cult favorite. So when the
previews for a movie based on
the cartoons and the series started
running early this year, the
anticipation was great.

It is possible that people will‘

i believe that, just like Batman, the

hype was so large that there’ was
no way the movie could have
matched it. The truth is that,
similar to Batman, The Addams
Family was bound to be a
disappointment because the hype
was not for the movie but for the

concept of the movie.

Unlike most movies, many of
these large-budget movies are
targeted for production before a
script is written. This was the
case for The Addams Family.
Larry Wilson, who had a story
credit for Beetlejuice and
Caroline Thompson, who wrote
Edward Scissorhands, combined
to write this script afterthey were
contacted by producer Scott
Rudin. According to the
November Premiere, the two of
them spent a month in a hotel
writing pages of script on a quota

' system.

Then after Wilson and
Thompson finished, Rudin
brought in New York playwright
Paul Rudnick to rewrite the script.

The result ruins the movie. To
try to make an idea into a movie
without having a good script is a
good formula for disaster, and in
TheAddams Family, it detonates
better than one of Uncle Fester’s
homemade explosives.

A clear plastic binder does not
guarantee an A, no matter how
professional—looking or expensive
it may be.

Civilization key to ‘City’ triumph

By Alon Orstein
For The Pitt News

Civilization is what it’s all about,
and john Sayles slams in head
first in perhaps his most
monumental work to date.

City Of Hope rushes down the
avenues of downtown corruption
and inner-city unrest with the
fluidity of a purse snatcher. His
lens wandering, Sayles (whose
directed such beauts as Mdleu/an,
BrotherFromAnotherPlanetand
Return Of The Secdcus Seven)
employs a multifaceted cast of
players and breathes life into a
stunningly real metropolitan
scenario.

Up-and—coming “thes” Vincent
Spano takes up the lead as Nick,
the disenchanted son of shady
contractorjoe Rinaldi. Nick dekes
out on a cushy, no—hassle job at
one of his father’s buildings and
dives blindly into the urban
morass. ,

From here the flick follows a
slim yet seductive narrative
thread, intertwined around Spano
and the -\tories of close to 40
other featured characters. Joe
Morton, of Equal justice fame,
plays the role of a town council
member walking a tight rope

between city hall and his alienated
black constituents.

Sayles, himself, puts in an
almost too believable per-
formance as the resident hooligan.
A virtually unknown yet
remarkably talented group of
individuals bring up the Hudson
City backdrop, carrying with it
everything from street violence
to political intrigue to ethnic
discontent.

When Nick becomes the pawn
in a high-level housing
conspiracy, things begin to spiral
out ofcontrol. At the close, village
idiot “Asteroid” echoes our
frustration, and we are left with
the haunting questions of hope.

Sayles, in his own anti-

Hollywood, non—linear fashion,
keeps things interesting
throughout.
- Taking into consideration the
limited budget (they brought it in
for under $5 million), the
production value is quite
impressive.

Burnt yellows and bright, fuzzy
white.s cast an unsettling haze
over the expansive Cincinnati
scenery.

Sayles once again demonstrates
his proficiency at conveying the
feel ofan area. Skinny gray houses

blocks reek of authenticity and
exemplify his trademark blue-
collar locations.

The cast is solid across the
board. Off-beat renditions of the
town’s quirky denizens are
somewhat reminiscent of Richard
Linklater’s Slac/eer, the summer’s
indie surprise. Sayles pushes and
pulls, pokes and prods these
players, forming a delicate yet
malleable web of relationships
that is nothing short of
mesmerizing.

What more can one say about
such a strong, entertaining and
important film? Along with Boyz
In The Hood I rank it as the year’s
best. Maybe our urban centers
are headed down the rocky road
to involution and decay. Maybe if
Bush and his lackeys keep
snoozin’, we will turn into one
big Newark. _

Or maybe not. One thing for
sure is thatjohn Sayles is etched
in stone. With all the riffraff out
there, this is comforting to know.
Perhaps come March, the

Academy will think seriously V

about giving the man his much-
due props.

Or maybe not. Right now we
can only hope.

So which is the real Penn State?
Is it the team that wrecked Notre
Dame and Georgia Tech or the
bunch that struggled against an
average Southern Cal team?

Most Pitt fans might like to
think that it’s the latter, but this
rivalry-usually brings out the best
in both teams. And Penn State
can be very good on both sides of
the ball.

The offense starts with senior
quarterback Tony Sacca, who has
proven a lot of people wrong.
His touchdown-to—interception
ratio of 4-1 is particularly
impressive for a wide-open attack
like State’s. While Joe Paterno
will never be confused with, say,
Jack Pardee, he has loosened the
reins and allowed Sacca to hold
sway over a potentially explosive
offense. Sacca has responded,

‘ completing nearly 60 percent of

his passes. Along with the passing
dimension, Sacca also is capable
ofscrambling with fairly effective

THE‘Fie.sta‘B0wl.|ll TEMPE. ARIZONA    

   
 

Come see the final

results. He has four rushing scores 

to go along with his 20 through
the air.

Penn State’s passing attack is
not as sophisticated as Pitt’s, but
it is still capable of big plays.
Sacca is more limited in his targets,
but they are good ones. Receivers
Terry Smith and OJ. McDuffie
have been on the receiving end
of 14 touchdown tosses. Together
they have caught 93 passes, more
than half of Sacca’s completions.
Both are big-play talents,
experienced and must be
respected.

The tight ends are a young
bunch, headed by sophomore
Kyle Brady. Brady is an architect’s
dream at the position: 6-feet, 6-
inches and 255 pounds. However
he still makes mistakes and has
only caught 14 passes.

While Paterno’s newfound
passing attack is working and
exciting, the running game still
has an important place in the
Lions’ offense. Where would Joe
Pa be without a stable of solid

PSU-Pitt

ADS still

talking

By Chris Franklin
scagr Writer

When Pitt takes on Penn State
next season at State College, _it
will be the ﬁnal meeting between
the two rivals. The 1995 season
will be the first one in which the
two schools haven’t played each
other since 1954. Although both
universities have talked about
scheduling further games, no
progress has been made as of
yet.

“Basically, we have talked, but
we have not ﬁnalized anything
yet,” said Pitt Athletic Director
Oval Jaynes. “We probably will
talk when the season ends.”

“I have talked with Oval, and
we’re still talking. That’s where
it’s at right now,” said Penn State
AD Jim Tarman.

The major stumbling block,
according to both men, is Penn
State’s Big Ten Conference
schedule. Big Ten rules state that
a team must play eight conference
games, and they must be the final
eight games of the season. Add
to that the fact that Pitt will soon
be playing a Big East schedule.

“This gives us the problem of
matching available dates,”
Tarman said. “I think both Pitt
and Penn State realize that it’s not
possible to play on a yearly basis.”

Jaynes said he hopes the Penn
State series can continue in a
pattern similar to that of the Notre
Dame series. From now until the
year 2000, Pitt plays Notre Dame
six times.

Bothjaynes and Ta rman agreed
that the series should continue in
some respect.

“We are very interested in
scheduling future games,”Jaynes
said. “I think it’s in the best
interest of both schools."

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, November 28, 1991

By Cory Walborn
Stcgﬂ‘ W/riler

Winning comes in several
different ways. Indiana’s Bobby
Knight throws chairs. Chicago’s
Mike Ditka throws tantrums. But
Pitt’s volleyball head coach, Sue
Woodstra, throws blanks. _

Saying very little and never
raising her voice, Woodstra truly
“speaks softly and carries a big
stick.” Her attitude keeps her
team loose but focused.

This “loose” attitude is one of
hard work and the desire to be
the best. The concept is unique,
but the results are ordinary: just
plain success.

Success has explained
\X/oodstra’s foundation of hard
work and her yearning to be No.
1.‘ —

With this structure she has
enjoyed the satisfaction of
winning. Combining the past and
present, Woodstra has guided
the Pitt volleyball program into
the realm of national prominence.

Growing up in Colton, Calif.,

,\‘I(/Oodstra was far from the scenic

beach and “fun in the sun” part of
California. Volley_ball was not
even in the back of her mind.

“I thought volleyball was a
stupid sport when I was a
freshman in high school,”
Woodstra said.

That feeling lasted until her
hi gh-school coach convinced her
to try out for the team. Woodstra
didn’t want to, but her parents

wanted her to.

“My parents always pushed me.
They believed in doing something
until you do it right,” Woodstra
said. She said her parents stressed

their hard-work values upon her. '

Those hard-work values
eventually started to pay off. By
\X/oodstra’s junior year in high
school, she had made the U.S.
Junior National Team. “I was one
of the last players to be chosen to
the Uunior National] team because
I didn’t have the finer skills, but
they liked my attitude.”

That attitude, consisting of hard
work and hard practice, improved
Woodstra’s ﬁner skills.

Practicing "six days a week for
the junior team, Woodstra and
her teammates were being
groomed for the \X/omen’s
National Team and the 1980
Olympics.

But before the Olympics,
Woodstra, along with several
Junior National Team,members,

enrolled at the University of

Southern California. Their vast
experience and hard work
overwhelmed the college scene.
Southern Cal posted_a perfect 38-
0 record and won the national
championship in 1977.

After‘USC, Woodstra made the
U.S. National Team. ‘Her hard
work and desire to be the best
culminated in WOOdstra’s winning
of the Mikasa Award for the
nation’s top all-around volleyball

‘player in 1979 and 1980.

A conversation about the end of the Pitt-Penn State rivalry

For the past 23 years, Nat and
Chuck have regularly met in mid-
November to eat dinner, renew
acquaintances and plan out their
annual tailgate party for the Pitt-
Penn State game. This year, the
two Penn State alums got together
at a trendy bar/restaurant for
burgers, booze and banter:

“So how ‘bout that Sacca? Really
turned it around, huh?” Nat said,
reaching for the ketchup.

“It’s about time!” Chuck said,
unfolding his napkin. “I knew
Joe Pa would straighten him out.”

“If he'd listened to Joe Pa three
years ago, we’d have ourselves a
national champion or two by
now,” Nat said before biting his
burger.

“Yeah, ol’ Joe Pa never ceases
to amaze me,” Chuck said, wiping
mustard off his chin. “Did you
know that after we crush Pitt,
he’ll pass that Ohio State coach in
lifetime wins? You know? The
guy who punched that Clemson
linebacker?”

“You mean Woody Hayes,” Nat
said. “His teams used to dominate
the Big Ten. Just like we will.”

“Got that right! Here come the
Lions, Big Ten bound!” Chuck
said, dipping a fry. “Comin’ to
beat the Buckeyes, Michigan;
going to the Rose Bowl to play
for the national title!”

“Well, the Rose Bowl hasn't
exactly decided a national champ
in a long time,” Nat said, sipping
his beer. “But that’ll change when
we get there._Ioe Pa will dominate
those tough Pac-10 teams.”

“You’re right, man!” Chuck said.
“Who needs Miami, Georgia or
Tennessee? Who needs the Sugar
Bowl or Fiesta Bowl? We’re gonna
play in the ‘Granddaddy of Them
All!’”

“I hear ya!” Nat said before
taking another bite of burger.
“But you know what's better?
Seeing Pitt suffer in Big East
football!”

“Yeah, you might as well give
a permanent league-champ
trophy to Miami,” Chuck said,
ordering another beer. “Pitt really
blew it with that league.”

“You hit the nail on the head
there!" Nat said, finishing off his
fries. “They’ve got sooo much

Brian
Gallagher

tradition in the Big East  l\'O'l‘!”

“They do have great hoops,
though,” Chuck said, grabbing
his beer from the waiter.
“Syracuse, the Hoyas, Seton Hall.
You can't deny that.”

“I know,” Nat said, lighting a
smoke.” But so does the’ Big Ten.
Great basketball AND football!”

“Joe Pa really knew what he
was doing, huh?” Chuck said,
pouring his beer. “He fixed hoops
up real nice! That Coach Parker
should be kissing the ground th
Joe Pa walks on!” ‘

“You mean Coach Parkhill,
right?” Nat said, blowing a smoke
ring.

“Whatever,” Chuck said,
crossing his legs. “Listen. Now
that Pitt is on the shelf, who’s
gonna be our big rival? Someone
from the conference or what?”

“I’d say OSU,” Natsaid, flicking
an ash. “They’re the closest
school.”

“I don’t know, man,” Chuck
said, scratching his chin. ‘‘They’ve
got that OSU—Michigan thing. How
about Iowa?”

“Too far away,” Natsaid, taking
one last drag. “Seems like half of
those schools are in another time
zone or something.”

“Hey, who cares? What are we
worried about? Joe Pa’s not
worried. It’s Pitt who’s losing
out,” Chuck said, picking his teeth.
“Heck, we fill up half of Pitt
Stadium when we play there!
And anyway, who do they have
left to play when we're gone?”

“West Virginia. You know, the
‘Backyard Brawl?”’ Nat said,
adjusting his seat. “They have
Syracuse left, too. Most eastern
teams, in fact.”

“We’ll still play Syracuse, right?”
Chuck said, opening a roll of
Turns.

“Nope,” Nat said. “They
wouldn’t take two away games
for one home game. Do you
believe that?”

“I know. Who wouldn’t want
to play Joe Pa’s Nittany Lions?”
Chuck said, rubbing his gut.

“Not Temple!” Nat said,
chewing his nails. “We’ll still play
the Owls —— get to see Philly
every once in a while.”

“Yeah, they’re really
underrated!” Chuck said,
stretching his back. “Doesn’t Pitt
get to go to Miami every other
year?”

“I think they do,” Nat said,
standing up. “I'm going to the
restroom. Be back in a minute.”

.While Nat was gone, Chuck
finished off his beer and lit a
cigarette. As he leaned back in
his chair, waiting for Nat to return,
a busboy came over to clear the
table.

Seeing the “PSU” logo on
Chuck’s sweater, the young man
spoke. “Are you a Penn State
fan?” the busboy asked as he
took Chuck’s plate.

“A ’68 graduate, son,” Chuck
said, sitting up in his chair. “They
don’t come any more loyal than
me. You root for Penn State, too?”

“No, I'm a Pitt fan. My dad
graduated from Pitt in ’72,” the
busboy said, wiping off the table.

“Send him my regards,” Chuck
said, looking off toward the
restrooms.

The busboy continued. “Listen,
can youxanswer me something?”
he said. “Why is Paterno being so
stubborn in not renewing a great
rivalry like Pitt-Penn State? I mean,
all those years and tradition
stopped by one man’s

stubbornness! It’s not worth it!” '

“Hey, Pittstarted it! Notjoe Pa!”
Chuck said, standing up to get his
coat. “They screwed us, so now
Joe’s screwing them back!”

“Oh! That makes sense,” the
busboy said, pushing his cart
away. “Whatever.”

As Chuck put on his coat, Chuck
glared at the busboy and took a
deep breath. A minute later, Nat
returned.

“You all set?” Nat said, pulling
his coat on.

“Yeah, let's go,” Chuck said,
walking past the busboy.

As they got to the door, Chuck
said, “Nat, can you actually believe
that Pitt has the gall to want to
renegotiate with Joe Pa? After

Bring spirit of college football back to Pittsburgh

After I ﬁnished covering the
Pitt-Rutgers game for the
newspaper, I went back tolmy
apartment and flipped on the
television to one of the college
games that was on that day. It
happened to be halftime in one
of the games, and a halftime
show, possibly ABC, was just
coming on. Watching the opening
introduction, I saw a bunch of
other schools and their crowds,
mascots and such, and I started to
feel a real jealousy.

After watching that display of
school spirit and enthusiasm, I
came to the conclusion that every
school in the country has a way
to get the crowd involved in the
games except us. Actually, Pitt

has absolutely no traditional thing .

that it does before football games.
Nothing. Nada.

Other schools do.

Take for instance the University
of Colorado. A live buffalo runs
out before the games, and the
place goes mad. At Clemson
University, just before the games
every member of the team touches

A a rock and sprints down a hill

onto the field.

The most famous to date is at
Florida State, where Chief Osceola
rides onto the field on a horse
with a flaming spear in his hand,
which he throws into the ground
on the 50-yard line, right by the
visiting coach.

Again, in these cases, the crowd
goes crazy. For that matter, when
the Seminoles score, the whole
stadium does the tomahawk chop
and chants the war song.

Why doesn’t Pitt have
something such as this? Why?

We don’t even have a special
song other than the “Pitt Victory
Song.” The University of
Tennessee, for instance, sings
“Rocky Top” before the game,
after big plays and scores. Over
100,000 fans sing and stomp their
feet so loudly, you can’t hear the
person next to you.

Now don’t give me the excuse
that we don’t have nearly the fans
that these schools do and that
even if we did, no one would
cheer. That is just a c'op—out. Hell,
if we had some type of song or

dance or cheer (i.e. “We are 
Penn State" and “Let’s Goooo 
Mountaineers”), then the 25,000
people that do attend games on
Saturday would cheer. I guarantee
it. ‘

It’s a shame that Pitt, a school
with such a long tradition in
football, can’t come up with
something to get the players and
fans fired up. You never hear
anyone say, “It’s hard to play in
Pitt Stadium.” Do you?

But you do hear that about
other schools’ stadiums. When
the University of South Carolina
plays rival Clemson, pageantry is
at its best. When the Carolina-
Clemson game is played at USC,
they hang a stuffed tiger from the
scoreboard. When the game is
played in Clemson’s Death Valley,
all the fans bring rubber chickens.

These teams even have special
uniforms they can wear. South
Carolina wears all black. Clemson,
on the other hand, wears orange
pants. This is the only time all
year long that either team does
this. Why don’t we wear a certain
color uniform for the “big game?”

Another impressive sight is at
Oklahoma games, where the
Sooner Schooner, a horse-drawn,
covered wagon, rolls onto the
field. The entire place goes nuts,
and it serves as a moral boost for
the‘ team.

These sights are so impressive
and appreciated by fans of these
teams that it’s impossible to
describe. We are really missing
out. *

Bob Maselli

Now I’m a senior, and I will be
leaving here soon. But before I
leave, I want this place to have a
reputation for getting excited for
football games even though our
attendance is dismal. And I want
this place to have some sort of
traditional sight that people who
come to our stadium will always
remember. .

I would have to blame this
whole situation on our past
administration, dating back to
the beginning of this school’s
football team’s existence: It’s their
fault. But I am challenging our
students, faculty and especially
our new athletic director to start
a long—standing tradition now.
Something needs to be started;

why not now?

I thought of some basic ideas
that maybe we can try. They may
sound unoriginal, but we have to
start somewhere.

I. Take the two panthers down
from that ratty old bridge that
leads you into Oakland from
Schenley Park, and bring them
up to the stadium. Place them
right on the steps in front of the
Stadium. This is where they
belong. Not on some bridge that

is rarely traveled. Some people,

don’t even know they exist
because of their location. Uust as
an idea: Before the “big game,”
we could all go and sleep out at
night and “protect” them as a
tradition.l

2. Change the name of Pitt
Stadium to Panther Stadium. It
just sounds better.

3. Go to the zoo, and get a live

mascot. Simple, right?

4. Paint the bleachers blue and
gold.

This is about all I can think of
without copying any ideas from
other schools. Maybe someone
else out there can think of
something. We need to do this.
It’s what college football is all
about
tomorrow. We must make
decisions now so that we will be
able to enjoy in the future.

Forget all the grumpy Golden
Panthers who come to the games
to tailgate and sit quietly through
the entire 60 minutes on their 50-
yard—line seats. Let’s get crazy at
the games. Let’s bring stuff to
throw at the opposing teams and
their fans. Get brave. This is our
turf. We don’t want them here.

Let’s put some pride in Panther
football. Amen!

On the desk of Bobby Lewis
there rests a photograph of four
smiling brothers of the Bianco
family, all of whom have played
baseball at Pitt under Lewis. One
of the brothers is a painting
contractor. One is a teacher and
coach. The other two are dentists.

Sammy Glass also played
baseball for Lewis as a catcher in
1968. Today Glass has a successful
practice as an ophthalmologist in
Johnstown.

These are some of the fondest
memories Lewis has of his 36-
year coaching career at Pitt. He
isn't concerned as much with
what a player did on the field as
what that player has become since
leaving Pitt. According to Lewis’
philosophy, baseball is more ofa
“means to an end than an end to
an end.”

“To see the success of an
individual and hope that you
played a small part in it; that's

retired from coaching in 1989.

Lewis, who is currently in his
second year as Pitt’s assistant
athletic director for men’s sports,
recorded 438 victories during his
lengthy career. This is a school
record. However victories aren’t
his measure for success.

“I don’t think I was a very good
coach,” Lewis said. “I just wanted
to be a good person. I wanted
[the players] to walk away
knowing they had a good
experience at the University of
Pittsburgh. I wanted them to have
the same pleasant experience that
I did when I was here.”

The year was 19/18 when Lewis
came to Pitt as a first-year student
after graduating from Schenley
High School. Lewis chose Pitt
over a group ofDivision II and III
schools since it was one of the
only schools around that offered
a degree in physical education.

“I always knew I was going to
teach and coach someday,” said
Lewis, who is also a member of
Pitt's faculty.

Lewis came to Pitt. He just
happened to grow up on Craft
Avenue, which is justblocks from
the campus.

“I walked by Pitt every day, so
I knew I was going to go there,”
said Lewis, whose grandmother

donated to the building of the .

Cathedral of Learning by
purchasing one ofits bricks in her
name. “My grandmother invested
in my education, and it worked
out that I went to Pitt.”

\\’/hile attending Pitt, Lewis was

- a three-year letter-winner as a

center fielder and captained the
team as a senior. Not long after
graduating, Lewis became the
Panther coach quite by accident,
when the ‘old coach, “Sarge”
Mitterling, suffered a stroke.

“'I'he day practice started,
lMitterling’s] daughter called and
said, ‘You’re in charge,”’ Lewis
said. “Eleven months later
lMitterlingl passed away.”

It was then that AD Tom
Hamilton asked Lewis to be a
full-time coach and a physical-

role with the university expanded
into the administration. He
became a program coordinator.
For the next 10 years Lewis
handled both jobs until it was
time to step down from the rigors
of baseball.

“It was getting harder on me
standing for all of the double-
headers. I just felt it was time to
give up coaching,” Lewis said.

Lewis, 62, discovered at the
time he had a circulation problem
in his leg, which caused him
discomfort. His condition was
finally resolved when surgery was
performed this past fall to
transform a vein in his leg into an
artery.At the same time Lewis’

coaching career was ending, a

new opportunity arose. Walt
Cummins retired as assistant
athletic director for men’s sports.
Former AD Ed Bozik gave him
the job.

“Things broke at the right time,”
said Lewis, who replaced
Cummins in June 1990. Lewis
said his new position is more of

concentrate on all men’s sports
excluding basketball and football.
The way he sees it, he’s the
luckiest guy in the world and
would never leave Pitt.

“It doesn’t get any better than
this,” he said. “I’ve never
envisioned leaving. We have such
a great university, great students
and a great faculty.”

Lewis has had the opportunity
to pursue a career in sales, which
he said would have been more
lucrative. But a sales career
doesn’t have the benefits of
interacting with students.

“Most people die and go to
heaven,” Lewis said. “Well, I’ve
lived heaven. I work with the
greatest group of people around.

schools feel the same way, but
we have a good mixture of people
here.”
Just how long will Lewis
continue his tenure at Pitt’
. “It depends on my health, but
as long as I can help Pitt, I’ll stay.”
It looks like Lewis will be

In last year’s contest, Pitt was
able to throw heavily against the
Nittany Lions, but Pitt quarterback
Alex Van Pelt was intercepted
four times. .

The Penn State secondary is at
least as good this year, but it will
have to defend the myriad of
targets that Van Pelt can utilize. A
strong rushing effort by the
Panthers can only help their cause,
especially if the State offense is
clicking.

On defense, the continued
absence of Keith Hamilton could
really hurt Pitt. Hamilton’s left
knee continues to hinder him,
and he is listed as questionable

can get to Sacca, it could force
him into hurried throws, making
the job easier for the secondary.

Gymnasts
win Metro

Invitational

Byjeremy Swarbrick
S tajf Wﬁter

The Pitt men’s gymnastics
team opened up its 1991-
’92 season by winning the
Metro Invitational, a five-
team tournament held last
weekend at the U.S. Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Md.

Pitt finished the meet with
a team total of 260 points,
outscoring second-place
finisher -William and Mary
(2494) and the third-place
team from Navy (248.45).

_Als.o competing in the

tournament were James
Madison University and
Radford College.

Panther head coach Frank
D’Amico said he was
extremely pleased with his
team’s victory. “Of course
we wanted to win, but we
wanted to set a good score
as a marker for the year,”
D’Amico said. D’Amico

explained that the team lost —

two top seniors from last
year’s squad, so “everybody
had to work a little harder.”

Pacing the Panthers was
junior Genero Severino,
who took individual all-
around first—p1ace honors
with a score of55.1 over six
events. Senior co-captain
Dave Bausmith finished
fourth overall with an
individual score of 51.55.

After the meet Bausmith
expressed his surprise in
winning the meet.
“Honestly, we didn’t expect
to win. We won last year
with a lot better team.”

In the floor exercise, Pitt
senior Kyle MacBeth took
third place with a score of
9.15.

On the pommel horse,
Severino placed second
with a Score of9.3. Severino
also took first onthe rings
with_a 9.55, second in the
vault (9.25) and second on
the high bar with a 9.2.
Senior Mike Englert also
placed for the Panthers,
finishing just behind
Severino to claim second
place on the rings with a
score of 9.3.

Senior co-captain Stu Yoss
explained that as a team,
“We wanted to use this meet

\ElS 3 measurement [0 SCC

where we are. Our goal
was not to win but to have
a good showing. It was a
bonus to win.”

The win is Pitt’s seventh
straight tournament victory,
a streak dating back to the
1990 season.

, “This is the highest we
have ever scored at this
meet or even this early in
the season, ” D’Amico stated.
“In head—to-head
competition, things are
different, but it is a very
optimistic beginning. I hope
we can improve on this.”

Pitt seniors look back on Penn State games

By Donald Young
For The Pitt News

Pitt versus Penn State. These
words together stand for many
memories, both good and bad.
The last four years alone have
seen four closely contested
games. Penn State has won the
last two exciting games by a total
of eight points. Pitt won the two
games before that by giving up
only seven points. '

The Pitt—PSU series will end
next year. Several Pitt fourth- and
fifth-year seniors were
interviewed about the Pitt-Penn
State rivalry. Linebacker Ricardo
McDonald said, “It’s terrible that
this rivalry has to end. The rivalry
ending "is like losing someone

you love, like a brother.” But he
also said he feels, “lt’s time to
move on.”

Linebacker Nelson Walker said
he is somewhat sad. I-le noted
that Pitt—PSU is college football’S
14th-oldest rivalry. The series
began in 1893.

Curtis Bray remained a little
more upbeat. He agreed the
ending of the rivalry is a shame,
but he said, “lt’ll pick back up in
a few years.” Bray and fellow
linebacker Ken Radinick
concurred that the series is special
for two reasons: The first reason
is that the records don’t matter.
The other reason is, “It’s a true
players’ game — no
administration involved.”

Steve Israel said he is ecstatic

about the game. He is a ﬁfth—year
senior, but he has never played
in a Pitt~Penn State game because
of injury and other reasons.

For Israel, McDonald, Walker
and the other fifth-year seniors,
this game is extra-special. The
past four years have had both
teams win two games. Therefore

a win will break the tie in Pitt’s,

favor. Ask these guys about their
favorite memory of the series,
and the answers will be based on
whether they are fourth- or fifth-
year seniors. Walker, McDonald
and Israel — all fifth-year seniors
—-— agreed their fondest memory
was the 10-0 victory at home in
1987, when they were first—year
players. As for the fourth—year
seniors, like Bray and ‘Radinick,

they smile most when they talk
about “going up to State” as first-
year players and winning 14—7 in
1988. None of the seniors said
they have friends at Penn State,
although many of the players on
the teams have been consistent
from year to year. Don’t worry
about any soft feelings because
as McDonald said, “I don’t like
em."

How important is fan support?
According to Israel, “Fan support
will be a definite factor, probably
bigger than you’d think.”

Walker said he hopes that
people will skip out on some
turkey and come to the game
because the fans could be a factor.

Bray said, “Hey, people will
show."

The Panther Hockey Club held
its undefeated Western
Pennsylvania College Hockey
Association league record this
past Sunday by defeating the
Rockets of Slippery Rock
University 6-3 at Golden Mile Ice
Center in Monroeville.

The Panthers showed that they
skate at least a level above the
Rockets during the first few
minutes of the competition. The
Rockets made up for their lack of

Five minutes into the

Slippery Rock retaliated late in
the period by netting a goal of its
own with five minutes remaining
in play. Pitt then returned to
score a goal at the 14:16 mark.
Pitt’s Don Fendor scored off Phil
l.aux to bring the score to 3-1 at
the end of the first period.

The second period began a
different style of skating for both
teams. Although the Rockets
continued to skate extremely
erratically, a few members of the
Panthers’ squad were beginning
to take a few cheap shots oftheir

own. The Panthers scored two
consecutive goals in the second
period. Both goals came from the
line of Crousey and Eugene

Rockets took two penalties.

period of the competition was
the most physical of the night,
the Panthers started it off on the
right foot.

At the :35 mark Barilla netted
his first goal of the evening, with
assists going to Crousey and Laux.

Although a few minor
infractions occurred during the
third period, things started to
heat up during the final seven
minutes of play. At the 10:30
mark, Pete Gadd ofslippery Rock
and Dennis Scanlon of Pitt took
off their gloves and went at each

disqualification. Although neither

received a slash above his right
eye when he was hit with a
helmet.

scored their "second goal of the

continued to tolerate Slippery

With two minutes remaining in

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, Novernbe1_'”.28, £991

Thanksgiving is always a day
for turkey, pumpkin pie and pro
football. However this
Thanksgiving Day is given a new
twist: This year’s Pitt—Penn State
game is being played on
Thanksgiving Day at 11:15 a.m.

We have the former athletic
administration to thank for that.
Apparently, former Athletic
Director Ed Bozik and company
didn’t care that a great deal of Pitt
students don’t live in Pittsburgh
and, thus, go home for
Thanksgiving. These students
‘could make it back by the Friday
or Saturday after Thanksgiving in
time for a later Pitt—Penn State
game. Given that fact, plus the
fact that there are more Penn
State alumni living in Pittsburgh
than Pitt alumni, don’t be
surprised if there ends up being
more Penn State fans at Pitt
Stadium for the game than Pitt
fans. Is this bad or good for Pitt?

Well, in recent years Pitt
seemed to play better against
Penn State when in front of a
hostile crowd. Last year Pitt
played one of its best games of

 
 

the season at University Park only
to run out ofgas late in the fourth
quarter. The last time Pitt beat
Penn State was on the road three
years ago. So maybe the
inconsideration for the ticket
holders which was commonplace
with the former Bozik
administration will be a good
omen for Pitt. In this year’s battle
of the big cats, the Panthers will
need all the help they can get to
beat the Lions.

Some more intangibles in Pitt’s
favor include the Panthers’ habit
of playing to the level of their
competition. Pitt seems to play
better against the good teams
and worseagainst the mediocre
and bad teams. I won’t say Pitt
will be treating this game as its
bowl game because that’s been
said by too many» sportscasters
and sportswriters already, but
Penn State may be looking past
this game to its bowl game against
Tennessee and former Pitt head
coach Johnny Majors.

ﬂ So let's hope we have a
memorable game since it is the
last Pitt—Penn State game at Pitt

Penn State says it may be able to

snubbed by Penn State the same
way Pittsburgh Pirate fans feel

wouldn’t join his all—sports league

any better between the two

to join the Big East Conference

thereafter Pitt was asked to join.

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Thursday, November 28, 1991

Woodstra

Continued from page P-3

With the boycott of the Moscow
Olympics in 1980, the U.S.
volleyball team, then captained
by Woodstra, had to wait four
more years in its bid for a gold
medal.

Instead of waiting, the U.S.
team played and played all over
the world. \X/oodstra led the
Americans in competition
throughout the world, visiting 20
different countries in the process.

When the 1984 Olympics came
around, the well-prepared U.S.
team fell short in the finals. They
did, however, win a silver medal
— the only medal the United
States has ever won in women’s
voHeybaH.

That medal gave Woodstra a
sense of satisfaction and
accomplishment that only hard
work can bring.

‘‘If you work as hard as you
can, you will derive plenty of
satisfaction from it,” \X/oodstra
said.

After six years on the national
team \X/oodstra moved on.
Splitting time between coaching
and playing, Woodstra lived in
Arizona during the summer and
in Tokyo during the winter. She
was an assistant coach at Arizona
State University and played
professional volleyball in Japan
for four years.

“When we won the Japanese
League Championships [in 1989],
I knew it was a good time to
finish my playing career,”
\X/oodstra said.

Finishing her playing career
meant the start of her head
coaching career— a change that
would enable Woodstra to use
her own experience and-
knowledge in a team effort.

“I wanted to channel my game
[as a player] into coaching,”
\X/oodstra said. Channelling
meant showing a team that hard
work and desire do provide
rewards and satisfaction.

This channelling happened to
take place at the University of
Pittsburgh, an awkward place for
a well-known volleyball star but
a place that had been consistently
winning for years.Woodstr2
replaced good friend Shelton
Collier as the head coach in 1989.

“I think Shelton wanted to leave
his team in good hands,”
Woodstra said. “I also wanted to
come back east and raise the
level of volleyball.”

These reasons brought
Woodstra to Pitt, and the winning
continued. “I love Pittsburgh, and
I have used my volleyball
reputation to make Pitt known,”
Woodstra said.

Making the Panthers known
was just the “tip of the iceberg.”
Woodstra made Pitt dominant. It
has not lost a Big F.astConference
match under her direction, and
Pitt’s overall record in \X/oodstra’s
three seasons is an impressive
92-22.

This success is Woodstra’s past
success shown through her
players. ‘‘I tell the girls to work
hard; ifyou give your all, you will

reap the rewards,” Woodstra said.

Woodstra said Pitt’s practices
manifest the “loose” type of play
the Panthers have shown since
her arrival. “If you get through
yvhat’s hard, you can have a lot of
fun,” she said.

Following these goals makes
the Panthers a great team, but
implementing these goals is what
makes Woodstra a great coach.

“She wins the girls,” assistant
coach Cindy Braziel gxplained
about \X/oodstra’s coaching
prowess. “She has the magic
combination,” Braziel said. “The
girls like her. They play well for
her, and they win for her.”

“There is such a light
atmosphere around Sue,” senior
co—captain Dee MacAulay said
about \X/oodstra’s coaching style.
“But she knows how to push us
and make us work harder. She is
the one who gets us {to the top of
our gamel:”

The team shows Woodstra’s
hard-work ethics and desire to be
first. They, like Woodstra, have
experienced the satisfaction of
victory. _

“The team takes on her
personality,” Braziel said. “Sue is
real positive and real honest. She
brings out the best in each
person.”

That is what great coaches do.
Woodstra has the discipline,

of her coaching career at Pitt.

0 Fact 1: She has led the Panthers
to four Big East Championships
in a row.

oFact 2: She was named Big
East Coach of the Year last season.

-Fact 3: She has never lost a
match against a Big East foe and
is hoping that the streak will
continue. '

These facts demonstrate the
“icing on the cake” for Woodstra
and the Panthers. Both can
appreciate these awards and
accomplishments because they
know it took a hard—working effort
to get them.

“I know what it takes to get [on
top], ” Woodstra said. “Now I focus
on 12 people doing the things I
used to do, to maintain that top
form.

“But I try to approach the game
as not a life-or-death situation,”
Woodstra explained. She wants
the girls to enjoy themselves.
They do. Plenty of smiles and
laughter are prevalent on the
court. This shows that “loose”

play can be achieved by a very

serious team.

Working within these

dimensions, \X/oodstra feels that

Attention:
There will be no

sports build the inner character
that everyone needs to enjoy life.

“One thing I teach [the team] is
how to work effectively with
others,” \X/oodstra said. She said
she teaches “how to add to their
lives and to other people’s lives
as well.”

Woodstra also stresses
academics. “It’s important to me
for the athletes to do well in
school,” she said. She explained
that hard work in school will
produce the same result as hard
work in volleyball: producing a
winner both on and off the court.

Her team responds. “She
understands [the players’] point
of view,” MacAulay said. “She
knows us well enough and is
able to ‘plug in’ her knowledge,
in different ways, to each person
on the team.”

Plugging in the hard-working
effort and the desire to be the
best is what Woodstra has done
all her life. In the past, it was for
herself and for our country. In
the present, it is for the Pitt
volleyball team. She knows this
effort has led to her success and
is now shining through her
Panthers.

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, November 28, 1991

Pitt, Penn State Gree

The brothers of Phi Gamma
Delta are coordinating the Pepsi
Pitt/Penn State Fiji Football Run,
an annual charity event coinciding
with the Pitt versus Penn State
football game.

The history of the run dates
back to the early ’80s. Spina Biﬁda,
Special Olympics of Western
Pennsylvania and the Western
Pennsylvania School for the Blind
ranked among the beneﬁciaries.

The run itself started on the
morning of the 23rd of November
in Happy Valley and ended in
Pittsburgh early Saturday evening.
The ceremonial game ball was
started in Beaver Stadium by the

  
  
  
 

   

 
  
 
 
 

Nittany Lion and was run in one-
mile increments by different
brothers of Phi Gamma Delta’s
Penn State chapter to a
predetermined halfway point. The
exchange was made at a Citgo
Station outside of the Johnstown
exits on Pa. Route 22.

The ball, at that point," was
handed to brothers from the
University of Pittsburgh’s chapter
and carried the remaining distance
into Pittsburgh.

The game ball will remain at

the Pi Sigma chapter house until .

Thanksgiving Day, when the ball
will be run into Pitt Stadium and
handed to Pitt head coach Paul

The ultimate goal is to raise as
much money for the charity
sponsor as possible.

This year’s beneficiary of the
efforts of the Pitt and Penn State
chapters is the United Cerebral
Palsy Association. Proceeds from
both chapters will benefit the
United Cerebral Palsy’s newly
created Pitt Greek Week
Equipment Fund.

This fund is one of the most
immediate means of positively
impacting the lives of people
with disabilities who live in our

“United Cerebral Palsy

Miriam May, director of
development and public relations.

“We’ve put a lot of effort into
making this run work. With the
help of dedicateddsponsorship,
such as that which came from

ks run game ball for charity  

Pepsi-Cola, we were able to make

the run a success," said Jim ,

Brinling, Pepsi Pitt/Penn State
Fiji Football Run chairperson. ‘‘All
proceeds are going to a worthy
cause, which really makes any
aches or pains seem small
compared to the good it
produces.”
