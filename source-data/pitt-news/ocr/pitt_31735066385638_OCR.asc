New AIDS treatment
to be tested at Pitt

By Linda Marie Micco
Staff Writer

Researchers have launched the
first phase of an experimental
attempt to destroy the AIDS virus
by activating patients’ own HIV-
speciﬁc attacking white blood
cells in vitro and returning them
to their bodies in a process unique
to the University of Pittsburgh.

Using a common technique
known as euphorisis, blood has
been drawn from six volunteer
patients with AIDS or a severe
AIDS—related complex and spun
in a centrifuge to extract only the
white blood cells. After the red
blood cells are returned to the
patient, the CD—8 cells, specific
disease—fighting lymphocytes
stifled by the virus, are then
isolated in a test tube and bathed
for two weeks in interleukin—2.
This is a genetically engineered
protein which allows the
lymphocytes to grow and
multiply.

The theorybehindthe research
is that after 12 weeks of repeated
infusions of highly purified CD—8
“booster shots,” these HIV-
targeting white blood cells will
selectively destroy the Human
Immune Deficiency Virus which
leads to AIDS, preventing its
replication by killing infected cells
and by ﬁghting other AIDS—related

infections such as
cytomegalovirus and
pnuemocystis.

“If the results from this trial are
positive, then this therapy will
represent a major advance in the
treatments, of patients with
immune-system diseases such as
AIDS and cancer,” said Dr. Ronald
Herberman, who is working with
the CD—8 cells in vitro for this
experiment as director of the

Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.
“HIV kills only one type of cell,
and that is CD—-4, which is another
very important lymphocyte. It is
sort of the leader of the orchestra,”

said Dr. Monto Ho, chief of the '

AIDS Clinical Trials Unit, which is.
in charge of all patient care and
follow—up for the study. After the
AIDS virus starts to cripple the
immune system, CD—4 can no
longer “direct” the infection-

killing CD—8 cells to work, said I

Ho, who is also chairman of the
infectious diseases and
microbiology department at the
University of Pittsburgh Graduate
School of Public Health.

Ho stresses that the research is
still in phase one, which means
that the physicians have not yet
determined whether there will
be such serious side effects as
toxicity associated with the
procedure. One of the initial
challenges of the study was to
isolate the CD—8 cells from the
other lymphocytes, according to
Ho. However, now the concern
lies in the patient’s ability to accept
the cells which have been grown
outside of the body for 14 days.

“We have already done four
infusions. So far it seems to be

going well,” said Ho, who plans V

to give each of the six patients
two more infusions of cells

followed by three months of *

extensive laboratory testing. “We
don’t have any of the acute toxicity

. that we’re watching for, nor do I

expect it.” According to Ho,‘ this
experiment is similar to some
cancer—treatrnent studies, because
some forms of that disease act
like AIDS in crippling the immune
system; however, at this time

there is no other cancer
application.

Campus Big Brothers and Sisters program may end

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Panther Pals, the University of
Pittsburgh’s 2-year-old Big
Brothers and Big Sisters program,
is in danger of being cancelled.

Ron Carter, adviser for Panther
Pals and Carnegie Mellon
University’s Big Brothers program,
said that Panther Pals is “in a
transitional period because the
current president is now in
Europe.”

Without a president and a
structured board of officers,
funding from Pitt’s department of
student activities will cease at the
end ofjune. Without that funding,
Pitt’s program cannot survive.

Carter said, “[Pittl won’t
recognize us as a structured
organization. Until we reorganize,
resubmit our budget, {and}
resubmit our officers and
volunteers, we can not apply for
any money from the university.”

According to Terri Milani,
associate director of student
activities, Panther Pals, like any
other group at Pitt, “has until
March 15 to remain certified by
[producing] ten volunteers and
three officers. After that, they
become inactive. They have to
meet the requirements by October
or inform the office that they
need more time, or they become
decertilied.”

Under this policy, Panther Pals

will have to forfeit any money
that has been given to them to the
student government.

Carter said the current president,
Holly Beaston, is studying abroad
this term and left the program
without electing a president or
finding an interim president to
take over her duties.

The rest of the officers, Carter
said, are leaving at the end of the
term and have cut back their
involvement in the program, as
the activities of the program are
at a near standstill.

Vice president Teresa
Perrington said that she is leaving
the program upon graduation at
the end of this term. She said that
she is still the acting vice president

and is willing to take on
responsibilities to keep the
program on its feet. \

“We tried to have an election
but only [the officers] showed up.
We can’t get a consistent number
of people involved who are
willing to make a commitment,”
said Perrington.

Perrington blames the loss of
their previous adviser for the
standstill of the program. Carter
has been a caseworker for Big
Brothers and Big Sisters of
Allegheny County and the
university programs since
November.

She said that she believed that
Carter was taking the
responsibility of finding a new

board of officers,
“Ron told me that he had a list
of contacts: a list that I haven’t

seen. He told me that he was ‘L

taking care of lrecruitmentl,” she
said.

Carter said that Panther Pals is
looking to assign a new president
and board of officers quickly so
that the group can stay in
existence. ‘

“We’re looking for, hopefully,
a high—energy freshman or
sophomore‘ [for president],
someone who wants to make a
commitment to stick around and
get involved and actually run the
program on campus.” he said.

Even though Carter said “he

Pals

Continued from page 1
would like to assign a freshman
or sophomore, the application is
open to all students.

Presently, Panther Pals has not
had any applicants for the
governing positions. Carter
refuses to blame the lack of
applicants on Pitt students’ apathy.
“I will not accept the fact that it is
a lack of interest, because there
are too many people here at Pitt
that would make me think that
there is a group of people of four
individuals that would be
committed to taking on the task
of running the Panther Pals
organization here on campus. I
think it’s a matter of [bad]
presentation and the lack of
[student] knowledge.”

Carter said that he is dispensing
ﬂyers and advertising in The Pitt
News in order to find people that
will fulﬁll the positions that are
needed. Once the positions are
fulfilled, Panther Pals can regain
their status and then be
considered for an allocation from
Pitt’s student government;

“I have no doubt that Panther
Pals will be revived once
[reorganization] takes place. All I
need is a body to work hand in
hand with me to get this thing to
ﬂy. I’m not closing the door on
the Pitt program. It’s going to
survive,” he said.

According to Carter, recruitment
is a lengthy and thorough two- to
three-month process that all

volunteers and board members
must undergo. The process
includes an orientation, Act 33
and 34 intensive background
checks, four reference checks, an
in-office interview and
questionnaire, investigation of the
applicant’s living environment
and a personality test that is
analyzed by a psychologist.

Milani, who helped start Pitt’s
Big Brothers program, said that
Panther Pals can apply for
extensions and will be given any
help that they need.

“If they are having problems,
all they need to do is come and
see me, and we’ll help them.
We’ll give them extensions if they
ask for them,” Milani said.

Carter said that current matches
between adult volunteers and
children are still in progress. The
program will soon suffer if it must
close, especially if it is defunct for
a long period of time. “As an
organization, it can do more. You
can have clout as an organization,
more accessibility to the campus,

plus funding which pays for
transportation, among other
aspects of the progtam," he said.

Not only will the lack of funding
cause volunteer transportation
problems, but it will tie the hands
of the recruitment process of
volunteers and board members,
which could possibly lead to the
program’s permanent end.

Carter made an extremely
rough estimate of $1,500 spent
for each volunteer and/ or board
member, some of whom don’t
even qualify for or stay with the
program.

I

Although Pitt’s Big Brothers and
Sisters program is faltering, Carter
noted that CMU’s program is
doing extremely well.

He said, “We’re currently going
through the same thing at CMU.
Fortunately, they had their act
together and had elections. They
now have a whole new set of
officers, and everything is going
as usual.”

He said, “The CMU program is
running very strongly. They’re
not having any problems with
[university] funding, and they get
funding from some of their

fraternities. They have quite a
few people involved, and they
have a very supportive student
body."

Carter said, “It's like night and
day. I can't believe the enthusiasm
of the exact same programs run
[at CMU], basically the exactly the
same way by schools basically
right next to each other.”

Carter said that he couldn’t
pinpointexactly why Panther Pals
has had so many problems, but
he blames it on the lack of
structure of the program’s
previous government.

H0 is examining the patients’
immune system for changes in
activity after each infusion of
CD-8 cells, and soon will be
“labeling” the treated cells with a
harmless radioactive substance
called indium, which will

One patient in this experiment,

clinical coordinator of the
Pittsburgh Trial Unit. “He says

about four hours’ to initially
remove the blood and 45 minutes
to infuse the activated CD-8. “He’s
had minimal effects, and is
tolerating these infusions well.”

However, Groh does not want
to build false hopes about the
procedure at such an early stage.
“We’re really only looking for
safety and tolerance right now,”
she said. “We hope that it will be
of benefit, but we don’t know
that yet.”

Individuals found to be HIV
positive (having the virus that
causes AIDS) tend to neglect
themselves, said Groh. “We try to
encourage them to avoid stress
and live as well as possible to
maintain their health. We’re trying
to find a medication or a treatment
which will help them live through
this.”

Arc/very targeted as newest club

By Chantal Evans
Staff Writer '

An archery club will soon be
the new addition to the various
student organizations at Pitt.
The president and founder of
the upcoming club is
sophomore Richard Kobuck.
“I’d like to have speakers come
to Pitt to speak on a;gghery and
bow hunting. We’ll ‘probably
have practices at Trees Hall
once [or] twice a week, but
practices will notbe mandatory,”
Kobuck said.

Kobuck said that the archery
club is basically modeled after
the Panther Pistol and Riﬂe club.
He also said that anyone is
eligible to join the club, and

that nothing is required from
members.

According to Kobuck, if the
archery club is established at
Pitt, members will be able to
compete in shoots with other
area colleges.

“During the fall and winter
semesters we will go to
competition shoots if the
members want,” Kobuck said.

Terrence Milani, assistant
director of student activities,
said that as long» as three
officers are chosen, a
constitution is written that is
not illegally discriminating and
if there are at least 10 members,
there should be no problem
with the club being recognized

as an official Pitt organization.

It has not yet been decided
who the vice president will be,
but Chris Domer and Arthur

Clark are candidates for the .

position, according to Kobuck.
George Gazzam is the treasurer
of the organization. At present,
about 15 students have shown
an interest in the club.

Milani said that to establish a
club at Pitt, certification forms
must also be filled out.

“These materials are geared
to provide requirements for
certification,” Milani said. After
the certification applications are
reviewed, a decision concerning
the validity of the club is made.

Smo/emg in the girls’ room

. The board of trustees of Chatham College, an all-
women’s school since 1869, is considering a proposal that
would allow men to enter the college in the 1991-92
academic year. On Monday, the trustees voted unani-
mously to consider the change and will make a final
decision on April 22.

The proposal has been met by intense opposition from
Chatham students. Many of the girls feel that the proposal
is a big mistake; about 1 50 of them angrily chanted, “Better
dead than coed” last Monday night.

Admitting male students is one among other considera-
tions of the trustees’ long-range planning committee, the
Committee on the Future. One student protested, “I think
a lot of students feel anger and resentment that they didn't
tell us about this whenwe were thinking of coming here.”

" Chatham students argue that the college’s all—women

tradition gives the school a uniqueness not commonly
found in modern-day colleges.’

Now granted, being unique may be a nice quality, but
it-is also rather trivial if it serves no beneficial function for
Chatham’s long-term objectives. Admitting men will sat-
isfy long-term objectives.

College President Rebecca Stafford said, “Studies have
shown that fewer than 5 percent will attend an all-
_women’s college. We feel we can attract more students to
Chatham [as a coed school], but we will continue our
commitment to women. We just feel that we cannot
enhance the quality of the school without having more
students.”

Additionally, college is supposed to better prepare a
student, whether male or female, for the real world. How
can a young woman expect to prepare herself for female-
to-male communication in such essential areas as job
interviews when they have had very limited experience in
interacting with men? A coed college provides that expe-
rience. ..

We must wonder whether the presence’ of men on
Chatham’s campus will actually destroy_the academic
quality and performance of female students. We have
difficulty envisioning hundreds of girls dropping from
their dormitory windows in the middle of the night to visit
male students, thus ruining their study habits.

Chatham students should set aside their archaic prefer-
ences and consider expanding the college’s future hori-
zons, thus making it more competitive in the national
collegiate circuit.

Casually walking by the New
York Times newsstand last T hurs—
day morning, I took a quick glance
and then a long stare at the front-

page headline which knocked

me over as if I had just been hit
by a Soviet SS-18 missile. The
headline read: SOVIET LEADERS
AGREE TO END COMMUNIST
PARTY MONOPOLY ON POWER.

‘ “Wow! I can’t believe it!” I yelled.

Political pluralism in the Soviet
Union?! Sure, it happened more
as a result of necessity than of
choice. Nonetheless, this is great.
The Cold War is over! After all,
the Cold War was based on the
Soviet ideology of exporting
communism, but if they’re no
longer going to be communist —
which their repudiation of Article
VI of the Soviet Constitution
should signify — then they can’t,
or at least shouldn’t be, exporting
communism anymore.

The underlying premise of the
Cold War — seemingly often lost
in the jungles of Vietnam and
deserts of Afghanistan — was

"that, in the end, there would be

an apocalyptic clash between the
United States and its allies and
the Soviet Union and its. But
communism, the link that held
the Soviets and their Eastern
European allies together, has been
broken. They can’t win; they
forfeit.

Imagine the money we’ll save
from defense cuts. We can finally
begin to concern ourselves with,
as the saying goes, problems in
our own country.

But then, ambivalence quickly
setting in, a frightening thought
struck me: if the Cold War really
is over, then who will I hate? I
won’t be able to commie-bash in
my columns every week. There
won’t even be a need for McCar-
thyism in the United States any-
more — since anybody who
would still be stupid enough to
be a communist after all this
doesn’t deserve our attention, let

Singingfh

alone worry. But still, that’ll be
good.

I may even be able to shake my
negative image as a “political
dinosaur” in the Free University
Press which was assigned to me
for my conservative anti-commu-
nist sentiments and rhetoric.

 

Paul

Kengor

Besides, the M-16 has been passed
to the true anti-communist
diehards in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union — they seem
rather eager to take over my old
job. (Has anybody noticed the
McCarthyism in Eastern Europe
these days? It’s quite prevalent.)

Yes, everything will be differ-
ent. Just imagine living without
containment. A U.S. foreign pol-
icy without containment would
be like a Middle Eastern terrorist
with no passenger planes to blow
up. It would be like a world
without the Ayatollah, Moammar
Kaddafi and Fidel Castro. It will
just seem as though something is
missing.

Furthermore, if we’re going to
be friends with the Soviets, then
we’ll have to quit referring to
them as Reds, Pinkos, Commies
and even Russians (they don't
like that name anymore).

But then, that means we’re
going to have to have to come up
with some nice, creative,’deroga—
tory names for our enemies in

No Cold W r Blues

Iran and Libya (they now move
up to numbers 1 and 2, respec-
tively, on Uncle Sam’s hate list).
Let me interpose with a few
suggestions: Muslim Maniacs,
Allah Oilballs, Persian Perverts,
Koran Clans and, my personal
favorite, that oldie but goodie,
T urbanheads. Think of the impli-
cations in terms of national unity;
everyonein the United States hates
Iranians and moron Moammar.

Of course, the historical Soviet
change doesn’t mean the end of
communism; Cuba, Albania,
Nicaragua, China and American
universities are testament to that.
But it should be the end of the
Cold War as we knew it: the
communist Soviet Union vs. the
capitalist United States.

So, should we lay down our
arms? Definitely not. SDI is needed
now more than ever to repel
incoming missiles, but now the
missile threat doesn’t come so
much from the Soviet Union as it
does the Middle East —— where
the Iranian, Libyan and Syrian
loonies are currently attempting
to develop, or may already pos-
sess, nuclear missiles. The Middle
Eastern madmen probably
wouldn't be too reluctant to “let
‘em fly,” as a missile-inferior Soviet
Union was in the ’SOS, '60s and
’70s. After all, Stalin, Khruschev,
Brezhnev and Andropov may
have been SOBs, but at least they
weren’t nuts.

Regardless though, before our
anxiety over future crazies be-
gins, let’s pause, put down the
Molotov cocktails and have a
nice, cold Budweiser and a shot
of Russian vodka with the Soviets
— a toast to the end of the Cold
War.

Then again, are the Soviets
really serious about this? Just
asking.

Valentine's Day...
...a giddy and goofy time of year

I just don’t get it. Everyone seems to
have a little too much milk in their
scrambled eggs this week.

One of my friends is ready to kill herself
because she has to live through yet an-
other single Valentine’s Day.

Another is terrified that this “total geek"
she met at a CMU frat party who keeps
calling her is somehow going to fully
embarrass her today. You know, he might
serenade her dorm room tonight or may
have placed a mushy ad

their eyes. After all, nothing would be
more humiliating than having to go through
classes that day not toting around a bundle
of stinky carnations for everyone to wit-
ness.

One by one they would be handed out,
until there were only about 15 or so left.
And guess what happened to them —-
yep, one girl, Shelley Slinkle, got them all.
It wasn’t fair, even if she was, and proba-
bly still is, a perfect~36—24-36. Didn't per-
sonality count? Boy, were

Love, or something un-
imaginably worse.
And’ still another
friend has complained

Crook

we all jealous.

least we
never went completely
without ﬂowers, though
-— there always was an

for the past two weeks
about how he’s furious
that somehow he feels obligated to buy
the love of his life “ﬂowers or a teddy or
something” so he doesn't look like a real,
well, insensitive butthead.

Then I have to listen to the “real men
and women” who ﬂat-out refuse to be
suckered into this “downfall of commer-
cialism at its greatest — this card—store
created mania that's just out to steal the
money of poor, innocent, love-sick teen-
agers.” One guy I know, a Pitt News
personality who will remain unnamed,
even thinks this day is just one more sign
of communist infiltration into our country.
Why? But of course, what else could the
vivid display of the color red mean?

But enough already. Tell me one holi-
day that isn’t commercialized. Even the
supposedly holiest — Christmas -—— has
been nearly reduced to a retail store-
owner’s dream and a consumer’s night-
mare. Yet for some reason, most people
still like those holidays.

So why do we all worry so much about
today?

I’m not saying I never did. Or for that
matter, still do. Yeah, I still remember
homeroom in high school every Feb. 14
when the student senate passed out the
camations that people had ordered dur-
ing lunch period the past few weeks for
their most highly regarded schoolmates.

The delivery girl would come in our
room with humongous buckets of red,
pink and white ﬂowers all smushed to-
gether and suddenly the room would go
silent. All the girls looked down at their
desks — so no one could see the fear in

unspoken agreement
between female friends
to buy a carnation for each other. That
way everyone could return to school Feb.
15 with a small bit of pride. Yet there were
always the guys and gals that didn't get a

darn thing. Nothing. It must have really V

stunk to be in their shoes. However,
believe it or not, some people had it worse
— like the boys whose mothers sent them
ﬂowers during the middle of geometry
class. They had the option of transferring
right then or suffering a slow, painful
death, courtesy of their schoolmates’ ridi-
cule.

On the other hand, I’m not sure that
many things can beat what one might term
a “successful” Feb. 14. You know, one
where you get ﬂowers and ﬂowers and
ﬂowers and an anonymous card or two. I
had one of those once; I still blame it for
permanently inﬂating my ego.

Sol guess it's all a matter of where you

stand on any given Valentine’s Day —

committed, casually dating, single, des-
perate or somewhere in between. But me,
I'm still a big advocate of today because I
can eat all the chocolate I want and not
feel guilty and, well, who knows what
interesting surprises I might receive this
year? It could happen.

As for you, well, if you’re thinking you
are the current apple of this writer’s eye,
who knows, you just may be. But please
just don’t get your hopes up too high. I'm
broke. Again. No roses for you. But after
all, it is the thought that counts. Isn’t it?

...a plot by communist subversives

Seeing as this is our Valentine’s Day
issue, I thought I'd ask an important
question: What is the true meaning of
Valentine’s Day, anyway?

Folklore tells us that some St. Valentine
fell in love with somebody important and
got executed for it. So what do people do
about it? They create a holiday for him.

What a joke. Valentine’s Day was cre-
ated for one reason and one reason only:
to make money. Does anybody realize the
killing that stores make

given in return. Everything about this
holiday has an ulterior motive.

Actually, my personal theory on the
subject is that it’s all a communist plot, de-
signed to make us yuppie, capitalistic
Americans infatuate ourselves with each
other.

This day must be a communist’s dream.
Everybody in America will be watching
each other, not the enemy. So what rea-
son do the Soviets have not to launch an
attack? Nobody here

over this day? Flower
companies live for this
day. Candy makers drool
for this day. High-school
newspapers use it as an
excuse to actually pub-

Jeff
Tatusko

will notice, because
we'll be so worried
about each other. Yes, I
feel that the world will
end on a Valentine’s
Day. But, at least every-

lish a newspaper and
make it sound important.

Now some people may call me bitter
just because I think that the person who
wrote “The Book of Love” was a drug
addict who had absolutely no sense of
reality, not to mention a complete opti-
mist. Call me bitter, but can anybody tell
me a reason why we have this holiday?

Look at Christmas, for instance. This
counts as a holiday because a religion
celebrates the birth of its leader on this
day. The same is true for Easter, although
that same leader rose from the dead on
that day. A true miracle. Did this St.
Valentine rise from the dead or create any
major miracles? No. He died. That’s it. It
sounds cruel, but everyone has to die
sometime. He died for love. Gee, isn’t that
special? 4

Now look at Memorial Day. We cele-
brate this day in remembrance of those
who died in the defense of this country.
This guy died for the love of a woman.
Big, fat, hairy deal.

_Granted, we do celebrate some silly
holidays. What is Thanksgiving? It’s the
celebration of a meal. It was a rather big
meal, mind you, but it was only a meal.
New Year's Eve is just another reason to
get really drunk.

But these days were established, na-
tional holidays. Valentine’s Day is a tradi-
tional holiday. But these days, who listens
to tradition anyway? "

Valentine’s Day is now almost totally
commercialized. Greeting- card sales
skyrocket. Red roses and candy are sent to
lovers in hopes that something will be

body in America will be

happy at the time. "D
You still don’t believe it’s a communist
plot, eh? Well, look at the color, we use to
celebrate the holiday. Yes, it’s red, the
color of love. It’s such an ironic color

though. Not only is it the color of blood .

(which gets spilled in huge amounts over
love anyway), but it’s also closely associ-
ated with our “friends” in the Soviet Un-
ion. ‘ g '

Now, you might say, look at the reforms
in the Eastern bloc countries and in the
Soviet Union itself. Communism is dead,
right? Think again. That’s what they want
you to think. They just want to lull us into
a position where we won't be looking for
an attack. It lends itself to the situation,
don’t you think?

But wait, this isn’t the worst part. If this
holiday wasn’t*bad enough, other places

. around the country have now started-

celebrating something called Sweetest Day.
Give me a break. I'm getting sick of all of
this nonsense. This country needs to stop

-concentrating on everybody inside their

lives and start preparing for more impor-
tant things, like the end of the world.

Boy, those commies must think we’re
really dumb. But we can beat them.
Refuse to celebrate Valentine’s Day. If
you’re going to break up with your girl-
friend, do it before Valentine’s Day. It’s so
much cheaper that way. Common sense
will prevail. Those damn commies don’t
fool me for asecond.

Tearing down not just an old church but a tradition

“You can’t tear those buildings
down; they’re a part of me,- they’re
a part of me. ” — Living Colour

“My God, whathave they done?”
A passer-by, observing the
destruction of the church.

Dear Old Church,

Grinning dollar bills sat atop
the wrecking ball and laughed
when it broke your buttressed
legs and gouged your eyes out_—
your windows. Old Church, this
week developers, driven by
avarice, destroyed you. Or at
least they tried.

You were the oldest existing
sanctuary, built long before my
grandparents arrived. When
smokestacks blackened the air
with their plumes of soot, your
air —both figuratively and liter-
ally — massaged peoples’ lungs
and soothed their spirit. When
men of labor had worked them-
selves to weakness in a dark mill,

your pews provided them with
rest; they left stronger.

I know why they wanted to
tear you down: somebody ceased
to own you, and a developer saw
a prime slice of real estate. For
this writer, the issue lies not in a
quarrel over ownership but in
what losing you means. It is both
the loss of a symbol and a gap in
the bridge that links one genera-
tion to its past.

Religion was the glue that held
our nation together. Misguided
demagogues have tried to dis-
solve that glue, bringing acidic
attacks on prayer in school and
on religious displays during the
holidays. “In God we trust.” Yes,
but it means reverence beyond
the dollar. The developer had
every technical right to tear you
down, Old Church, but you ought
to have remained. You were a

symbol of that piety: a beacon of

devotion in a society that has
become more and more godless.

It was something of an ecu-
menical outrage when the cranes
lifted your brittle debris from the
rock pile.

We are a people who are
meaningful only through an

Michael
Moore

understanding of our roots,
through an appreciation of that
great American history. We can
show our grandchildren pictures
of you, but those cannot be
touched or felt. As an aspiring art
historian, I can't help but feel a
void in linking the past now that
you are gone. In Lithuania and
Norway, among other traditions,
bogwood is a physical bridge
between past and present. It is
wood that is submerged into a
bog, and several generations later

is removed as a blackened icon.
One generation puts it in, and
another pulls it out; they are
bonded. You were blackened,
Old Church, but we haven't saved
you. Could we care less about
preserving our heritage?

I know we can't save every-
thing that pre-dates Planned
Parenthood, but you were the
oldest. Couldn't we have taken
that into consideration? Will
cement fill our heads whenthere
is no more stone left standing?
America is such an infant, and it
bothers this writer when at this
stage in our development — as a
sovereign tradition, gaining
uniqueness from the Old World
— that we would be so eager to
rid ourselves of you.

I know there is always a time
for goodbyes, but we could have
done better. Nobody really tipped
his hat to you in your final billion

breaths, but only tipped the

switch that brought you down.

Disrespect, combined with eco-
nomic irreverence, can only lead
to temporary betterment. Tradi-
tion and heritage — these things
can't be bought. Walls of yellow
— F. Scott Fitzgerald's color of
wealth and destructive greed —-
were revealed as your facade fell
to the earth. That you were

. painted in that color is only too

ironic, I thought, as Gatsby him-
self sat and watched.

You existed not only in stone
and wood, but in prayer and
memory. When the last piece of
your debris finds its way to eter-
nal blackness, you will not cease
to exist. Your domain went be-
yond that plot of land. 4

Developers will build and fall,
but your domain will not.‘ You
have achieved permanence; it’s
just a shame that we have no
tangible proof.

Sincerely,
Michael Moore

Plenty of stripes, but no stars in 80-77 UConn lss

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Everybody loves the circus.

And a circus is was last night at
Fitzgerald Field House as the
referees dished out 44 personal
fouls and three technicals in the
Panthers’ 80-77 loss to the
University of Connecticut

. Huskies.

Fans were screaming, objects
hit the floor at certain intervals
and profanities abounded from
the stands as an irate crowd
expressed their disappointment
with the men in black and white.

On the ofﬁciating, Pitt’s Jason
Matthews and Darelle Porter both
said with an angered look, “No
comment.” Leading scorer Brian
Shorter (27) said, “It was the
most ridiculous thing I ever saw
in my life.”

Head coach Paul Evans said
sarcastically, “They [the -officials]
were wonderful.”

The Huskies’ early full court
pressure set the stage for a run-
and—gun contest and plenty of
physical action all over the court.

The Huskies picked up the ﬁrst
four fouls of the game. But Pitt
proceeded to pick up the next
nine.

Theylgwantlters did not buckle‘
undé}, the press and were down
 than six within the
first 11 minutes until a strange
turn of events gave the Huskies a
cool six charity shots.

With Pitt down by one, Shorter
was called for an intentional foul

A on sophomore forward Rod

Sellers. Evans disagreed and
attempted to make his case with
the ofﬁcial. Evans was tagged

with two technicals and the
Huskies nailed four of the six
ensuing shots to take a 21-16
lead.  *

A fired up Pitt squad rallied
late in the half and pulled to
within one point twice in the last
two minutes. Rod Brookin sunk
all three of his attempts from
three point land in the first half
and played an instrumental role
on defense, causing several
Huskie turnovers and ﬂying high
for a monster rejection on aJohn
Gwynn layup attempt. I

Shorter knocked down 11
points and Porter dished out
four assists to take the Panthers
into the locker room down by
only three, 38-35.

‘‘I thought this was an
emotional win for the coach,”
said UConn coach'Jim Calhoun.
“This was a game which both
teams certainly wanted to win
and they went at each other from
the beginning and it was a difficult
game to control from the
beginning because of the
frustrations of both teams.”

Pitt led once in the second
half, by only a point, and fell
behind the rest of the game. But
with 3:28 to go, this contest had
all the makings of a come from
behind nail-biter.

Pitt pulled to within one as Pat
Cavanaugh sunk two clutch free
throws after being fouled by
UConn’s Israeli freshman
sensation Nadav Henefeld. But
the_Huskies went up by three on
an ensuing possession at 7875.

needing a three-pointer to tie the

Douglas’ claim legitimate
in annals of boxing lore

MIAMI BEACH, (Feb. 25, 1964)— 22-year-old Cassius Clay
beats "int/incible” heavyweight champion Sonny Liston, who is
unable to answer the bell for the seventh round.

James “Buster” Douglas is not the undisputed world
heavyweight champion yet. But he deserves to be. Douglas
thoroughly pummeled Mike Tyson until late in the eighth
round of their title fight in Tokyo.

That’s when Tyson threw his first effective punch. It was a

‘ patent uppercut that was not quite powerful enough to knock
Douglas unconscious. It was strong enough to knock him
down and force a re—evaluation by the challenger.

CHICAGO, (Sept. 22, 192 7)— Savage puncher Jack Dempsey
knocks down Gene Tunney in the seventh round. Dempsey does
not proceed immediately to a neutral corner, and the count
lasts for 14 seconds. Tunney gets up and wins a 10-round

Douglas waited until referee Octavio Meyren counted to six,
then began to get up. Unlike Tyson, this is not the first time
Douglas has been knocked down in a professional fight. He

Swimmers and divers earn prestige

By Jim Iakely
Staff Writer

No team has dominated the
Big East swimming scene like the
Panthers, and for the eighth
consecutive year, the Pitt women’s
swimming and diving team has
won the Big East championship.

Here are some quick facts to
put the victory in perspective:

-Pitt swimmers captured nine
event championships to match
the nine titles won last year.

0Lady Panther swimmers
placed no lower than sixth in any
event

-Runner-up Villanova’s best
‘effort in the 200-backstroke
placed them 15th out of 16
swimmers.
0 Pitt’s eighth championship ties
a Big East record for most
consecutive conference titles.

A Pittsburgh sports dynasty
continues.

The four-day event began last
Thursday as freshman Donna
Flatch won the 1—meter diving
championship en route to
capturing the Diver of the Meet
award. Her score of 389.85 was
good enough to earn a berth in

5

the NCAA pre-qualifying meet.

Syracuse diver Shannon Jerome

spoiled a clean sweep by the

Panthers with a second-place
ﬁnish. Nicole Bunker, Krissa Ratliff
and Mindy Hennon finished third,
fourth and fifth, respectively,

leaving the rest of the pack far
behind.

Ratliff finished her Big East
career in grand style by taking
the 3—meter board championshi p.
Her point total of 431.30 was
plenty to qualify her for the NCAA
pre-quals. She won with an
impressive 15-point cushion.
There was a lot of blue on the
victory stand as Flach, Bunker
and Hennon ﬁnished second,
third and fourth, respectively.
Hennon was in sixth place when
the first half of the diving ended
but wound up in fourth place.

On Friday, the swimming
events began. Pitt took their eighth
consecutive 200- freestyle relay
championship with a time of
1:36.60. Second—placed Boston
College ﬁnished over a full second
behind.

Pitt expected Villanova to
challenge them in the freestyle
events, and that is exactly what

happened. Theresa Picklo placed
second to Mary Dowling of
Vil1anova’s winning time of
4:56.05 in the 500 free. Two- time
defending champion Celeste
Makiel of Pitt finished a surprising
seventh. Jill Comeau finished
fifth with a time of 5:05.74. Clare
McShane and Liz Sari placed 10th
and 12th, respectively. It may
have been an odd day for Pitt
freestyle as each swimmer was a
few seconds off her best efforts.

The competition in the 200
individual medley was so tough
that Laura~Lee Sullivan’s winning
time of 2:08.07 last year would
only have placed her third this
year. As a result, she finished
sixth in the ﬁnal heat. Suzi
McManus placed 11th swimming
in the consolation heat. Rival
Villanova placed second, third
and fourth. ,

Senior Laure Walczak finished
her Big_East season with a victory
in the 50 free. Close times were
expected in the sprint events,
and Friday’s event was no
different. Walczak’s winning time
of 24.09 was .07 seconds off her
personal best, and a victory by

Lady gymnasts Vault past Temple, Kent St. for first Win

By John Iabriola
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers’ gymnastics
team caged the Temple University
Owls (179.75) and the Kent State
Lady Flashes (180.50) this past
weekend at Trees Hall with a
score of 183.75 en route to its first
victory of the season.

The Lady Panthers are now 2-
10.

“Was I pleased! Man, I couldn’t
be more pleased,“ said Coach
Debbie Yohman about her team's
victory. “Then I say the same
thing I always tell them. There
are a couple of things we could
change, but we still had a couple
of mistakes.

“This was the best performance,
all four events, every single kid,
so far this year,” added Yohman.

The Lady Panthers started the
meet off with vaulting, while the
Lady Flashes started on the
uneven parallel bars, and the
Lady Rams received a bypass.

The Pitt squad turned in high
scores on the vault to give the
team a score of 45.65, while the
Lady Flashes received a 44.95 on
the uneven parallel bars.

Scores of 9.0 or higher for the
Lady Pantherswere turned in by
Kristen Brown (9. 1), Gina Venezia
(92), Karen Jorgenson (9.0),
Shelly Sleith (9.1) and Jennifer

Butkovich (9.25), who is coming
off of a shoulder injury.

“Our vaulting scores were
average, but we have average
vaults,” said Yohman. “We don't
have real high difficulty on
vaulting, and the scores are good
for what we did."

For the second round of the
competition, the Lady Panthers
moved on to the uneven parallel
bars, with Temple on vault and
Kent State receiving the bypass.

“We usually have trouble with
our releases and just making it
through our bar routines without
falls-. We finally had a good day
on bars,” said Yohman. “We’ve
been working hard on it, and if
the kids stay consistent, we will
continue to improve on bars.”

Strong bar routines for the Lady
Panthers were turned in by Hope
Celani (8.4), Kim Miller (8.95),
Kathy Wallish (9.1), Brown (9.35)
and Roby_n Borchers (with a career
high of 9.5).

“Actually, Iwas surprised; that’s
the highest I’ve ever scored on
bars ever. Bars aren’t supposed
to be my best event,” said
Borchers.

Going into the third round, the
Lady Panthers received the first
of their two bypasses of the meet,
while the Temple squad took its
turn on the beam and Kent State
did its floor exercises. V

Entering into the fourth event,
the Lady Panthers led the Lady
Rams (90.85) by one-tenth of a
point with a score of 90.95, while
the Lady Flashes held third place
with a score of 90.60.

“I'll say it right now; we won
this meet on beam, ” said Yohman.

A surprise was that Tina Taylor
was not competing on the beam
for this meet.

“When I took her off beam, she

wasn’t real happy about it," said
Yohman. “Basically, Tina suffered

a loss of confidence.”

According to Yohman, after
the falls that Taylor experienced
during the Purina Cat Classic,
she had to rebuild her confidence
level.

“As the week went on, she got
better, but I decided that Kathy
Wallish would have an all-around
meet this week,” said Yohman.
“That meant someone had to
come out on beam, and that
meant Tina, because Tina's beam
workouts this week were the
weakest of the group.”

The Lady Panthers turned in
almost ﬂawless beam routines,
but Yohman said that although
the routines were solid, they
were not clean or smooth.

“They looked a little nervous
or stiff; whereas, last week they
just breezed through the
routines," said Yohman. “I think
that’s because they were trying
so hard, and they knew they
could stay on, so they worked a

little slower.”

High scores for the Lady
Panthers on beam were turned in
by Jorgenson (9.05), Sleith (9.2),
Wallish (9.2), Venezia (9.3) and
Borchers (9.35).

During the fifth round, the Lady
Panthers received their second
bypass, while Temple and Kent
State battled for second place.

The Lady Panthers opened the
sixth and final’ round of the meet
with their strongest and highest-
scoring (46.7) ﬂoor performance
of the year.

Strong floor performances for
the Lady Panthers were turned in
byJorgenson (9.5), Venezia (9.4),
Butkovich (9.25), Wallish (9.2)
and Taylor (9.35).

“My confidence level was
down, and she wanted to keep
me out for a week, ‘til I get myself
up, and now I’ll be ready for next
week," said Taylor.

“Now she should have her
confidence back after her floor

Panther Notes:

The Lady Panthers will be
hosting both the University of
Rhode Island and James Madison
University at Trees Hall on
Sunday, Feb. 18 at 2 p.m.

Last year when the Lady
Panthers and the Lady Rams
bumped heads in Rhode Island,
the Lady Rams came out on top.

“There's no way they ever
should have beat us,” said
Yohman. “We had the worst meet

I have ever been involved in as a
coach at Pitt. 

“I feel that this weekend is
going to be a grudge match, only
because the kids knew they
shouldn't have lost last year. So
they’re going to want to stay on
top of things this week and make
sure that doesn't happen again,”
continued Yohman.

Yohman also feels that James
Madison will be a good team to
go up against, because it becomes
stronger every year.

“I'm real excited to see them
because [there are] some
Pittsburgh kids on their team,”
said Yohman.

posted the 14th best time.

Pitt captured the 400- medley
relay championship and set a
new meet record with a time of
3:55.61. A

Saturday’s competition began
with the 200-medley relay team
edging Boston College for the
victory. Pitt's time of 1:47.92 is
almost a full second faster than
last year's winning time. The
Lady Panthers have won the event

seven of the last eight years.
One of the most grueling events
is the 400 individual medley.
Swimmer of the meet Cindi
Luciani of Providence became
the 1990 400-IM champion with a
time of 4:29.08. Pitt’s Karen Masal
swam to a sixth—place ﬁnish with
a time of 4:38.62. Comeau placed
second in the consolation heat
and posted the 10th-best time in
the event. Interestingly, Sullivan
and Mary Caspero, who posted
Pitt's best times in the event last
year, did not compete.
Villanova only entered one

swimmer in the 100 butterﬂy,
and that is all they needed to
win. Jenny Miller took the event
with a time of 57.84. Julie Rocks
of Pitt finished third, only .24
seconds away from victory.

the top three slots in the 200
freestyle. McShane, Picklo, and
Makiel finished fifth, sixth and
seventh, respectively. In the
consolation heat, Gallagher
placed second, and Walczak came
in third.

Sullivan kept hold of her 100-
breaststroke championship by
holding off her own teammate,
Masal. The pair are two of the
best breaststroke swimmers in
the east and proved it with an
impressive 1-2 sweep.

Ritch of Providence came close
to Sandy Albright’s meet record
of 57.88 in the 100 backstroke but
missed by .04 seconds. Albright
was nearly three seconds off her
record mark and pulled in a
fourth-place ﬁnish. Sophomore
Trina Thames, who looks to fill
the shoes of the graduating
Albright, placed second.

For most people, the thought
of swimming for 18 minutes is

. enough to make you cough up a

lung, but for these exceptional

endurance athletes, it’s just
another day at the office.
Villanova’s Mary Dowling won
the 1,650 freestyle, but the Lady
Panthers showed their depth by
ﬁnishing ahead of most of the
rest of the swimmers. Comeau,
Picklo and Liz Sari ﬁnished third,
fourth and ninth, respectively.

The 200 backstroke matched
the swimmer of the meet against
Thames, Pitt’s fastest swimmer of
late. Luciani of Providence earned
her award by beating the rest of
the Big East pack very
convincingly. Thames finished
second, andjanine Atiyeh placed
eighth. Liz Sari, who swam the
1,650 free only two events ago,
came in fourth in the consolation

heat and finished 12th overall.

The Lady Panthers will host the
Eastern Women's Swimming
Championships, which begin in
two weeks, hoping the home-
water advantage can bring home
the title.
