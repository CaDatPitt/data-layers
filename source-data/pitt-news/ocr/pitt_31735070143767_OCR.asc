‘Horror’
ﬂick rages
to stage

by Andres Nliguel
Staﬁ’ U7/'£ter

This weekend the massive Eq-
uitable Gas . clock-sign in the South
Side will serve as a  beacon for
Pittsburgh’s alternative theatergoers,
sci-ft monsters and '— of course —-
sweet transvestites from Transylvania.

On Friday and Saturday at 8 pm,
the Rage of the Stage Players, com-
prised of local thespians and Pitt stu-
dent Shana Fowler as the music direc-
tor, will be  out its three—week
run of Richard O’Bnen’s cult classic,
“The  Horror Show” —.— al-
beit a version unlike  even
the most hardcore  Horror fans

have ever seen.

“TheRockyHorrorPicture Show,”

a sexy and subversive musical satire of
the horror and sci—f1 ﬁlm genres, was
first performed in 1973 and 
became an_ alternative theater staple
“[The Rage of the Stage Players]
philosophy, when we do stage stan-
dards, is to make changes without
fear,” said James Michael Shobeg
director of the show and founder of
the Players “I re—i1.'I1agined all the char-
acter conceprs, visuals and even some
of the ichoreography, but I reﬁised to
touch the dialogue or the music”

, Awisedecision,as“TheRocky
Horror Show” is perhaps best known
for its leagues of zealous fans that
dress up as their favorite Rocky Hor-
ror characters _— and other sci-fr and

~ honor ﬁgures —- to attend infamous

Rocky Horror late-night showings.
“I was, of course, aware of the

A fervor of Rocky Horror fans,” said

Shoberg “I  just removed enough
from Rod(y Horror to be able to
make these changes, and I knew I was

on the right track when [my wife] Car-~

rie, a fan and long-time performer of
the show, started  excited about
the changes” , ‘ ,

The general plot of the ‘show,
however, remains unchanged.

EDITORIAL _ --

for hookah's

hazards 

Hookah as dangerous as cigarettes, 
but many don ‘t know zt s

The laid—back atmosphere
surrounding hookah has long

« kept it off the health radar for

many hookah smokers, who see

_ it as more of a social activity

and an opportunity to relax with
friends.
The

misconception that

1» smoking hookah does not pose
. health risks is especially a con-

cern when it comes to college
students. While the practice

 of smoking hookah has been

around for more than 400 years;
the trend has seen a revival
among the college crowd.

A recent study by Pitt’s School
of Medicine revealed that 41

_ percent of Pitt students have
g smoked tobacco from a hoo-

kah and that nearly 88 percent

: of those students plan to do so

again.
And yet, it is likely that most
of these students are not fully

- aware of the dangers it poses.

When cigarette smoking ﬁrst

T became popular in the United
‘ States around the turn of the
M century, it took health profes-_

sionals nearly 50 years to affirm

 the dangers and even longer for
3 many to accept those dangers as
a fact.

Nonetheless, health pro-

: fessionals worked tirelessly to
A prove that cigarettes are harm-
~ _ ful. But those same efforts seem
 to be lost when it comes to hoo-
 kah.

For many people, hookah

: smoking is not practiced as fre-
§ quently as cigarette smoking.

Seen as a largely social and

5 cultural activity, deeply embed-
, ded in the traditions of many
1 countries, hookah smoking does
 not share the same negative stig-

ma as cigarette smoking.
But contrary to popular be-

S lief, hookah smoking is as dan-
% gerous, if not more so, than
; cigarettes.

According to the U.S. Cen-
ters for Disease Control and
Prevention, a typical one-hour-
long hookah smoking session
involves inhaling 100 to 200
times the volume of smoke in-
haled with a single cigarette.

The CDC also reported that
hookah smokers are in danger
of sustaining the same diseas-
es as those caused by cigarette
smoking, such as oral cancer,
lung cancer and reduced pulmo-
nary function.

And because hookahs use
charcoal to heat the tobacco,
the health risks are increased as
carbon monoxide, metals and
cancer—causing chemicals are
produced at higher levels.

To regular hookah smok-
ers, these facts might come as a
shock, especially because smok-
ing hookah does not feel as
harmful as smoking cigarettes.

While cigarette smoke causes
a burning sensation in the throat
as it is inhaled, hookah smoke
is cooled down by the water
pipe and is thus a lot easier to
smoke. Further-
more, the shisha tobacco come
in various ﬂavors, like mint, kiwi
and strawberry, which makes
the experience much more en-
joyable and seemingly innocu-
ous.

But no matter what the level
of enjoyment or relaxadon, it is
important that people are aware
that smoking hookah on a regu-
lar basis puts one’s health at
risk.

The dangers of hookah
smoking should be publicized in
much the same way health pro-
fessionals and activists raised
awareness about the dangers of
cigarette smoking and continue
to do so.

People should not continue
to live under the misconception
that hookah is harmless.

Power struggle likely in N. Korea

As we’ve seen with past foreign
policy misadventures, the only
thing worse than a corrupt, back-
ward leader is an even worse

that Kim is seriously ill, but his
complete absence from the public
spotlight during the past few weeks
has failed to convince anyone of
this. With each passing day, uneasy
media speculation seems to grow.
I’ve read concerned reports talk-

of upheaval on the Korean penin-
sula is on a lot of people’s minds

seem to be forgetting is that these

Dear Editor,

I read the column “Palin best female VP"

candidate from Alaska” by Giles

and a comment he made is untrue.

“Nothing says spiritual like attempting to
remove books from libraries that teach
children that homosexuals are people, or
supporting the teaching of creationism in

schools because one shouldn’t be
information.”

I suggest he do some research before mak-
ing statements such as these. The Pitt News
is a widely circulated newspaper in Pitts-
burgh, and‘ a number of your readers were
misinformed by today’s edition. I picked up
his motive for writing the article, but this
statement that he wrote was written.,a_s a’
fact, when it actually isn’t one. It’s one 
to draw people away from a candidate be- ‘
cause of the truth, but it’s completely im-

moral to do it through lies.

Dear Editor,

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

Giles Howard’s column, “Palin the best female VP candidate from.Alaska,” was utterly distasteful ‘and disrespectful to those who are
practicing Christians. His View is typical of the secular progressive movement in this country, which continuously mocks the Judeo-
Christian principles that this country was founded on. I ﬁnd it amusing that Mr. Howard criticizes Gov. Palinifor her faith in God, yet

makes no mention of ‘Sen. Obama’s religious connections during his one-sided political piece. Perhaps this is because when religion

a

and Obama are mentioned in the same sentence, his associations with his anti-American pastor Rev. Jeremiah_Wright and Rev. Michael
Pﬂeger would immediately pop into most people’s minds. ., 1 '

Mr. Howard attacks Palin’s faith-based social policies of teaching abstinence rather than safe sex in schools, obviously taking a veiled
shot at Palin’s 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, who is pregnant. But Bristol Palin is engaged and is going to marry the father. To the con-

.trary, Obama is. on record for saying that if one of his children has an unplanned pregnancy, he doesn’t “want them punished with a

baby.”

accomplishments to speak of and has no beneﬁcial solutions to offer the American people.

Jesse J. Sabatini

He was the only person in the Illinois state legislature to speak against the state’s Born Alive Infants Protection Act, which extends '
legal protection to an infant that was born alive after a failed attempt at induced abortion. Who do you think, Bristol Palin or Obama,
is being the more reasonable and responsible individual?‘ 1 ' . '
Mr. Howard assails Palin for her lack of experience, yet she has more executive experience than Obama. In addition to serving on the
' Wasilla citycouncil, being the mayor of  cityiand being the governor of the state, Pali_n chaired the Alaska Oil and Gas Conserva-
tion, Commission. She has taken on corruption in her own party and has achieved real change in her career. I would like someone to
‘name one accomplishment of  never run a city or a state, and he has not written  major legislation since being in the
Senate. Liberals have resorted to attacking Palin and Sen. McCain because their candidate is an empty suit of change, has no political

South. Right now the heavily _
. guarded demilitarized zone at the
38th parallel separates the two na— V

tions. Although the reuniﬁcation
of Korea has long been a goal of
both the Korean and international
community, the divide in prosper-
ity has led many in the South to
worry. about the effects of a" po-
tential flood of immigrants from
the "notoriously poor North. With
a -per capita GDP of less than
$2,000’— vs. the South’s $25,000
GDP ﬁgure 4 experts predict the
South’s strong economy would be

devastated by such an inﬂux.

But what reason do we have
to believe that North Korea will
make a serious attempt to cross the
DMZ under a new regime? While
it’s always better to err on the side
of cautionin regards to defense, it
mostly seems likeernpty specula-

tion. Keep in mind there are big:
ger players involved here, none of it

whom are eager to see any kind of
serious territorial incursion.

The United States and South
Korea will likely look toward
China. to take control in securing

a peaceful transition when the
time comes. With respect to ‘the

China-North Korea relationship,-

both would like to maintain the
close ties they’ve developed. And
while some might overstate the
inﬂuence of China on North Ko-
rean politics, a new government in
North Korea will not be able to
survive on its own without Chi-
nese assistance. '

Last year, the North imported
the majority of its. food and 90

' percent of its energy supplies

from China. Of course, right there

is reason why China does not want
to lose that market. The North is
also a tourist destination for mid-
dle—class Chinese, who willingly
submit to security measures like
leaving passports and cell phones _
at the border in order to enjoy the
few North Korea offers.

Most importantly though, from
the Chinese perspective, is main-
taining the strong capital invest-
ment that is coming in from South
Korea. Recently, South Korea’s
investment in China overtook that
of . Japan’s — despite ‘a Japanese

economy that is four times larger.
The ‘growth China has been en-
joying cannot afford a major Ko-
rean disruption, and I donit expect
they’ll allow one to happen.

When the time comes, look for
China to take a responsible role in
the handling of its neighbor, tak-
ing pressure off an overburdened
U.S. government. For North Ko-
rea, Kirn’s departure might not
be a pretty transition, but it won’t
spell doom.
