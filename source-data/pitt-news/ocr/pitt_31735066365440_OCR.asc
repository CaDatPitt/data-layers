New guest policies for residence halls have been endorsed by the

Residence Hall Advisory Board (RHAB) and.-will be immediately en-
forced.

The changesin guest policieshresulted fromjthe need to clarify

John Vrana. head of the Housing Office, appointed a committee.
chaired by Judy DiMittia and made up of ‘RHAB members. to study
these problems and recommend changes to the RHAB.

i A" definite limitation has been established for the length of a -gue'st’s

visitation. The policy states that'.“any guest who resides in the resi-
dence -halls for over one week is considered in violation of the‘ guest
poli_cy.”_ - . . ' A

Sign-in procedures will be completely eliminated‘ in the Towers
complex. although they will be maintained in the Quad dorms for all
male guests. Vrananoted that the sign-in procedures have been inef-
fectual in the Towers and that the RHAB committee felt continuation of
the policy would be of little value.

The committee suggested that Women‘-s Housing Board and Men's
Dorm Council set guidelines for the maximum number of guests a dorm

resident may have at any one time. Action has yet to be taken"on this .

recommendation. .. ' ‘

_A-minimum age of six yearswas established bythe committee for
all dormitory guests. ' «

Enforcement of the new policies will be basically dependent on
student cooperation. According to Vrana./the Housing Office will not
initiate investigations of policy violations until a formal complaint-has
been filed with the Housing Office. _ T

In comparison with other Pittsburglt colleges/Pitt's new guest
policies are quite liberal. -

.. Carnegie-Mellon University dormitories are closed to guests at
midnight on weekdays and 2 a.m. on weekends. David Ginevan of
C-lVIU’s housing office reported that a proposal for 24-hour open houses
is presently under consideration buthe said chances for its passage are
slim. He cited the problem of guests living in the dorms as the major
obstacle to the proposal’s acceptance. ‘ -

Visiting hours extend _
ends at Duquesne University. A policy instituted within» the past two
weeks requires anyone entering a Duqucsne dorm to produce universi-
ty identification: security forces are strictly enforcing the new rule.

All dormitory guests must also be signed in and out of Duquesne
dorms and must be escorted to and from reception areas by a dorm
resident. ' V _ . ’

Attempts have been made at Chatham College to institute a 24-hour
open house system very similarto the one at Pitt, but there ‘has been
little success in liberalizing the policies. I ; ‘ ’ - ‘

.Betsy Day. -president of /Chatham‘s' House Board.‘ said that a sur-

the possibility of a student—work—

Optimistic about the depth of
such an alliance, Cramer said stu-
dents distributed anti-war leaf-
lets in factories have found more
responsiveness among workers
than ever before. i

“There’s much less resentment
towards students." Cramer said.
“Even students with long hair get
a good responsefrom the work-
ers.” '

Noting that 160 trade unionists
have endorsed the anti-war move-
ment’s drive for the Saturday ral-
ly, Cramer said United Auto

ticularly receptive. He added that

are keenly interested in the anti-
war movement because they have
come to realize that the Nixon ad-

a ministrations wage freeze is ulti-

mately a result of the war.

Does th_e student willingness to
participate in demonstrations in-
dicate a belief in the responsive-
ness of the American political
system? Might the anti-war move-
ment endorse a dove candidate for
President, after the Nov. 6 rally.

According to Cramer. the an-
swer is no. While admitting that
"the vehicle of mass demonstra-
tion is an attempt to effect change
through the system,” Cramer ar-
gued that the system is too cor-

.rupt to be salvaged. Moreover.

he sees the Vietnam War as a con-
sequence of the system.

Sneering at the Nixon adminis-
tration's Vietnamization effort.
he termed it a camouflage for the
pursuit of victory. and argued
that the war is merely becoming
less visible. I

As for an endorsement of a dov-

would jeopardize the stability of
the anti-war coalition. ~ I

“If we were to endorse McGov-

ern, it would split the movement,”
he said. ‘

with a shower of days gone by.
The smell of fresh popcorn pene-

A far cry from last year’s bare
pumpkins stationed around cam-

races invited a sizeable turn-out-
students coming and going from
classes and students with a spare
half hour amid a week of mid-
terms.

The drive was proposed and

F rut   ‘demise’ examined  

by MIKE MILLER

According to popular rumors.
the college social fraternity.
like the Edsel or the Brontosaur-
us. can neither capture the con-
temporary imagination nor meet
the challenge of a changing en-
vironment. V

Formed nearly 100 years ago.
fraternities seem destined for
extinction. The question of their
impending demise remains a sub-
ject of debate.

According to, Steven Kaye, a
former member of Pi Lambda
Pi, the Greek system is out of
step with today’s student.

"I found that there were a lot
of good things about frater-
nities. especially when I first
came here. but as time went on
I felt myself changing faster
than the fraternity system. I be-
came more \liberal and more
friendly.

"The people I know who are
entering the University now are
more liberal and more friendly
than I was and the fraternities
have not changed fast enough
-to cope with their questions or
the activities they want to be
involved in on campus."

Kaye added that fraternities

still serve an important need
for some students.

The Greek system. he finds.
provides a form of relaxation
that he cannot find in other

positive incentive in joining.
Being a commuter, Jehovics
found that the fraternity was a
way of establishing closer ties
with the University.

Assi_stant Director of Student
Activities Louis McLinden feels
that fraternity members are far
from being in the same class as
Edsel drivers.

As far as the death of the Greek
system is‘concerned. McLinden
states. "I thinkit‘s a fallacy."

McLinden said that frats satis-
fy a desperate need for group
identification for incoming stu-
dents. He agrees with some of
the critics. however. in that many

students outgrow this need as-

they become upperclassmen.
though many upperclassmen have
needs which the fraternities
can satisfy.

Many observers, both mem-

bers and non-members, have
concluded that the Greeks, ‘
though declining, still serve _

a purpose for someindividuals.

As one former brother stated.
"I definitely feel that the frater-
nity system has a place on cam-
pus because any institution that
is ethical and honest and attempts
to cope with boredom and loneli-
ness should survive."

Bike registration set 1

  

by DICKIWALTVERS

A new. voluntary bicycle regis-
tration system recently develop-
ed by Campus Police officers
has been initiated to aid in the
recovery of bicycles stolen on
campus. a

According to Joseph Gil. Supt.
of Campus Police. "the system
will consist of an owner's regis-
tration file: a serial number
assigned and electrically stencil-
led on bike frame; and a dupli-
cate registration card retained
by owner.“ .

The recent upswing of bicycle
thefts on campus has prompt-
ed this action.

The registration system. open

to all members o_f the University

community who ride_ bicycles
to campus. will said Gil. provide’
a quick. uniform. semi-perman-
ent. means of identifying and
verifying ownership of recover-
ed bikes.

"It must be understood.“ Gil
emphasized. "that this system
aids in the recovery of stolen
bikes. notin preventing their
loss. Theyowner must- take the.
responsibilities of insuring that
his bike is properly secured by us-

The concept of a Pitt Woman, compared to that of a Home-
coming Queen, is a good one. If it continues, hopefully it will be
improved. Having a board of judges comprised only of women

would undoubtedly help.

If the current attitude of students continues. however, it might

. be better if the competition were once again for a Homecoming
Queen. It is uncomforbable and annoying to witness blatant hypo-
--"crisy, especially when it is perpetrated by fellow students and. more
heartbreakingly, women students. We have discarded a Homecom-

ing Queen in title alone.

Better still would be the abolition of the contest altogether.’ '
 ucha_/pageant is demeaning to women, and ought to be discon-

inued. 7

Any judgement of women, for the amusement of men is grossly
(demeaning. The traditional Homecoming.Queen contest was a flag-

though, other students were reluctant to accept
constructive, humanistic change when it was offered.

‘The bulk of responsibility lies with the organizations which
nominated candidates. The Pitt Woman was supposed to be an ideal

finalist parades around in hot pants at Homecoming, the answer

fulfilling his Constitutional duties.
Michalik grinned sheepishly.

“I suppose I’m’ guilty of that,” he
said.

Michalik shakes his head incredu-

"Do'you know how many bullshit

and how little gets done? They just get

jg Starnes “working miracles’ in

w

\V

 

by CHARLES LEVINE
Drama Staff

"I hope to inform the public
that children with such problems
exist." explained Leland Starnes.
director of the University The-
aters upcoming production of The
Miracle Worker.

Helen Keller. the subject of Wil-
liam .Gibson‘s realistic script.
was rendered deaf. dumb. and
blind early in her childhood.

We all know that. What we don’t
know, according to Starnes, is
that the teaching techniques em-
ployed by Annie Sullivan, Helen’s
private tutor, are basically the
same ones being _used today and
funds for such treatment are just
as scarce, despite a great in-
crease in the incidence of such
cases.

In‘ accordance with the great
demand placed on the director and
cast. Starnes has undertaken a
conscientious program in con-
junction with Mary Moore of the
Department of Special Education
and Rehabilitation. Mary Moore
is, ironically. the name of one of
Annie Sullivan's early teachers.

The cast has also been spend-
ing a great deal of time at the

_ Western Pennsylvania School for

the Blind and Western ‘State Hos-
pital, working with and learning
about the children.

“This type of preparation is es-
sential,” said Starnes, “and we
are all very excited about what
we’re learning.”

Starnes asserted that the plight
of such children _as Helen Keller
is by no means a hopeless one.

“There just aren’t enough in- .

formed people,” stated the direc-
tor, “and very little is being done.”

Textbookslor the Fall Term will be removed from the Book center
shelves on November 12, 1971 to make‘ room for the incoming Win- 
ter Term Books. It a textbook was orderedaand youhave not started
to use it in class, have your Professor call The A Textbook Department
and the book will be retained until the end of the term. A

Although one of the purposes of
the show is to be an informative
and educational experience for the
audience, Starnes stressed the
importance of this production for
the cast. Because of its documen-
tary style, The Miracle Worker
presents a fine opportunity for
work in the realistic play.

According to Starnes. Pitt‘s the-
ater program aims primarily to
teach . theater techniques. and
such a production as this is a good
chance to work on many of the
points raised in class.

In keeping with this. Starnes
casts his shows solely with Pitt
talent. a practice unknown here
before his arrival. This is not the
only innovation that has accom-
panied him.

The Studio Theater in the Ca-
thedral basement, the entity
which is now recognized as the
best of its kind in the area, was
acquired largely through the work

"It came a piece at a time. as
did the money." Starnes smiled.
"We ended up installing large
parts of the equipment ourselves."

enth production Starnes has di-
rected since coming to Pitt in

not versed. Formerly at Yale Uni-

Before Saturday's contest with.
Syracuse began. Pitt head
coach Carl DePasqua told‘ his
team to "have some fun in this
game and not to worry _about
mistakes.” . t

The calming approach result-
ed in a 31-21'victory for the Pan-
thers now 3-4. as they beat the
Orangemen at their own game
of grinding out yardage and ball
control.

Additionally. the Cats had the
chance to capitalize on some-
one else’s mistakes for the first
time this season. The Orange-
men turned the ball over on three
fumbles and the Panther offense
converted the recovered fum-.
bles into two touchdowns and a
field goal. '

“We got some fumbles _ and
good field position in the second
half and we were able to cash in

on them,” said DePasqua after V

the game.

The Panther defense got off to
a rough start as the Orange
scored the first two times they
had possession. After that. they
stopped Syracuse from making
a first down a majority of times
they did have the ba-ll.

Cindrich and Joe Carroll were

Harriers, clomirlatei ﬁeld
at Canisius Invitational

‘by VINCE DiNARDO

The Pitt Cross Country team
continued to show their awe-’
some power and depty last Sat-
urday afternoon.

They turned a tough Canisius
invitational meet into a runaway
victory, their third consecutive
of the current season. at Dela-
ware Meadow Park, in Buffalo,
New York, by scoring a low total"

of 24 points.

Jim Banner’s long distance
runners proved that they were
deep in ability and talent. by
overwhelmingly all the oth'er'24

competitors. Despite the facile’

fashion of their victory. competi-
tion-wise the’ meet was by far
the most difficult test of the
harriers to date.

After Dave -Antognoli of Edin-
boro, who won first place in the
meet, the. Bannermen made it
look like Pittwas the-only con-
testant, at least as far as the first
eleven places went. '

“It was the best competition

. we've seen so far,” commented
Banner afterwards.

“Our boys
(six of them) finished only 50
seconds apartywhich is only an
indication of- what a beautiful

team" effort it was.”

had little trouble adjusting to.

the shorter course. About the
only difference was that it took
the thinclads almost 10 minutes
less to finish their jaunts.

The meet, because of themore
intense competition, gave Ban-
ner a better chance to evaluate
what he ‘already knew to be a
good team. With 24 teams com-
peting, Pitt only missed out
on two of the first five, and

Delta Sigma Phi and Delta Tau Delta emerged as victors in yester-
day’s intramural football action on the Pitt Stadium’s Astro-turf.

In a closely contested game, the Delta Sigma Phi‘s edged the Sig-
ma Chis. 28-21. while Delta Tau Delta rolled over the Kappa Sigs, 35-0.

In the Delta Sig-Sigma Chi contest. Delt quarterback City Frank

Gill threw four touchdown passes
to spark his squad’s attack. Bill
Connely and Dick Trotz pulled in
two passes each to account for the
Delta Sig points.

Sigma Chi quarterback Mike
McCafferty also had a fine after-
noon as he threw three touchdown
aerials. Keith Stewart, Bob Mann-
ing, and Ken Krenicky grabbed
one pass apiece for the Sig Chi
tallies.

' However, an interception by Del-
ta Sig Gill set UP the winning
touchdown. Gill took to the of-
fense and threw a TD pass.

It was an easier day for the
Delta Tau Deltas as quarterback
Steve Kiser passed for five touch-

downs while the Delt defense held
the Kappa Sigmas scoreless.

Kiser connected with Ed Hohos
and Bob Loughery twice each for
the scores while. A. J. Grant
