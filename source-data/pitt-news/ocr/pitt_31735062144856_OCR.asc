FRESHMEN FORM‘
DiscUssiON GROUP

To create ‘interest in public
speaking, debating, and argumenta-
tion, a group of freshmen have
formed the freshman forum. I

Officers will be elected following
preliminary meetings. A constitu-
tion has been drawn’ up.

Dr. Elmer Graper, head of the
department of political science,
says: “It is a very excellent idea
to have such a discussion group.
The trouble with students is that
there has been no way for them to
meet to discuss questions informal-
ly. - There is no other organization
with which I am so much in sympa-
thy. Such a’ group will promote
clear and forceful expression.” Pro-
fessor W. M. Parish, professor of

ublic speaking, suggests that all
reshmen interested in debating
should join the freshman forum.

Each speaker in the forum is
given seven minutes to present his
views on a selected question, after
which the subject is thrown open
for general informal discussion.

Pitt Student, Who “Knows Nothing About
Art” Visits International Art Exhibition

By Poltroon, A Student

Since it was Sunday afternoon,
the person that I was in love with
that week-end and I visited the Art
Exhibition that everyone has been
talkin about. It has been re-
viewe by experts and inexperts,
clergy and laity, connoisseurs and
dilettantes, by scholars and, now,
by the popular conception of a stu-
dent. . .
At two-thirty, we inadvertently

' entered and saw all the folks from

the outlying districts who are‘ in-
terested in good pictures, all the
folks from the inlying districts
who are interested in moving ic-
tures, andall the other folks.’ he
institute was nearly as crowded as
the radio exhibit at Duquesne Gar-
dens, but most‘ of the people were
walking through so fast that the
exhibition must have looked like an
animated cartoon to them. In
short, the place was crowded,
malodorous, and noisy. With a
muffled scream, my heart’s desire

A rushed for the open air, but I beat

her to it. _ 4 - .
‘We walked into Schenley"1Pa'_. k,
breathing all the while, until we
came to a steepness where we sat
and watched red canoes shooting
over the pond below in, Panther.
Hollow. We were happy there until
‘four-thirty, which is almost closing
time for the Park. We walked to
the Institute again. It was now or
never, and we decided on now. Tak-
ing a deep breath, we lunged into
the milling crowd, bought .a guide
book, and'looked at apicture. Some-
thing titled Platonic Conversation
is goor‘ for a ﬁve—minute laugh at
any wake. Abe Savage says they
ought to have named it The Derby
'5'-inner. There were also a lot‘ of
pictures titled Still Life. ItVis a

behind me and the bad air and the
heat and the people there, I did

‘like the Exhibit. Of course, one

gets ‘tired walking all over those
marble ﬂoors and, since there» were
two of us, we—but that’s an old
joke. To keep to the topic sen-
tence, (I just love topic sentences)
I found a beautiful admixture -of
colors. There/were simple repro-
ductions, in the naturalist mood, of
all sorts, of lovely women, homely
men, and of natural scenes. There
were im ressions and caricatures
and sym lisms and freaks, all the
stuff that goes to make an exhibit,
and very few’ of them are easily

-overlooked. It would beperhaps de-

cent, unless presumptuous, of me- to
point out one thing or the other
about the place, but I refrain on the
ground that half of the fun of visit-
ing the gallery is in makin inde-
pendent discoveries and forming un-
guided opinions, to compare them
later, if ‘necessary.

If any of you young folks are
thinking of visiting the Exhibit,
let mo give you a piece of advice
out of my experience. Be sure to
have plenty of time on your hands.
Do not try to do the whole business
in half an hour, or even in one
visit. Make the expedition on a
day when everyone else is at home
with the mumps. Have mother pack
a light lunch for you. Follow these
directions carefully and you will
feel better in almost no time.

I dOn’t like the ﬁrst prize. It
may be art, but I’ll gurgle butter-
milk if it's pretty. It was a still
life icture, and I never did care
for ower vases or fruit bowls. My
girl,‘ who knows much more about
these things than I do, said that
they always give the prize to a still
life group.‘ The painting with
First Honorable Mention, however.
would be picked out of any crowd.
E_-lxplain it if you can.‘

DR. CRANAGE CONTINUES
TALK ON ARCHITECTURE

Continuing his lectures on archi-
tecture before Pitt faculty and stu-
dents in Mellon Institute last
Wednesday and Thursday, Dr. D.
H. S. Cranage of Cambridge Uni-
versity, England, gave his impres-
sions on the “Regulation of Archi-
tecture” and traced the “Develop-
men’; of Architecture.”

Stating that too much regulation

 

 

 

ment body is ex‘ .'emely dangerous
to the best interests of architec-
ture, Dr. Cranage gave many ex-
plicif examples’ of regulated archi-
‘1;€ct’(1'rE“ih"*E1‘Pgl’8nd;““"' "‘~  " ’ "  '
In concluding» his talk on the
"‘Regulation of Architecture," Dr.

authority on all buildings is needed
in order that no new ideas will de-
stroy the beauty of the old archi-
tectural successes.

Many interesting historical facts
were brought out in the third lec-
ture on the “Development of Archi-
tecture.” “Architecture , has a
great deal to say if we go back to
ancient times,” declared Dr. Cran-
age. “Architectural monuments
that have been discovered have
helped ‘in ascertaining historical
facts. Religion and civilization have
been studied through the medium
of architecture,” he continued. Dr.

ture of ancient Greece is the ex-_
pression of reﬁnement in fine
curves and. lines and that if the
‘works of the Middle Ages were
compared with the written records
they would be found to supple-
ment each other.

Dr. Cranage emphasized the de-
pressile, compressile, and tensile de-
signs of the three great pri iples
of architectural design. Co$ent-
ing on the tensile principle 0 sup-
port, he claimed that Pittsburgh
better illustrates this principle
than any other city in the "United
States by its many bridges.

Asked as to what he thought of
Pittsburgh architecture Dr. Cran-
age stated that he thought city
skyscrapers then were designed as
well as possible. He stated the
hope that Pitt along with _many
other schools would have a school
of architecture in its curriculum
andexpected to hear of such prog-
ress in the near future. .

The lecture last Thursday con-
cluded a series of talks on archi-
tecture. Dr. Cranage will deliver
one lecture today and another Fri-

ing National Movement in the Old

  ALUMNI EIITHUSIASTIC 

OVER FOOTBALL TEAM’

The Pitt-Tech football game was
the ma et which attracted thou-L
sands o Pitt alumni to the Pitt Sta-
dium Saturday. Hundreds of these
camc from out-of-town
some of themir-om grea
It was a perfect day, a wonderful
game, and a great crowd. and the
Pittites all went home delighted
with the outcome. and all the more
proudof the University's football
team and the Pitt Stadium. The
alumni had been praying for 8. View
tory over Tech this year,  the
decisive manner in which-it was ac-
complished made cveryoiie , feel just
right. ’ .

While the Panthers have been
making one of the best records in
Pitt football history, W. & J. and
Penn State have been keeping apace,
andthc parties with the two ancient
rivals wil draw capacity crowds to
the Stadium. . J. has ven-
qulshed Carnegie Tech and Lafay-

 ette, and has only Thiel to. face beg;
. fore tl.ie}Pitt-W. & J. classic. Which,‘

means that two undefeated teams
will meet, both well coached and
strong in every possible way. The,
advance sale for -this game is even
heavier than ZE01‘.’i.‘.1e Tech game. and
1; will be surprising if it does not
pack ~.the bQ’WI. . p
The State Classic 1
Thanksgiving Day . is always a
gala occasion for Pitt and State
alumni, and State people are much
enthused over their victories at
Pennsylvania. and Syracuse.
State alumnus would give his good
right hand to" have it football victory
over, Pitt on.':1‘hanksgi.vin . and that
is the one aim_,of every t. Nitteny
.adIl18rei1it*" ‘  ‘ ._’State game in the
past has“-alwj as drawn the largest
crowd of the‘ car at the Stadium,
regardless of t .e. records of the two
years, and with both teams havln
unusual strength this year, a record
is pretty sure to be broken.
Sandwiched in between the W. &
J. and State ames is the Nebraska
_ga_ine. The . iant Cornhuskeirs are
just as “gi_an%y"’ as evcr.gudg..1ng. by
all reports. ey are sad to be one
of the biggest teams in the United
States an one of the most powerful.
Pitt football fans will recall how
Missouri defeated West Virginia’
e~a,s_il~ last year, and the reports
wl.ic came to Pfittsbijnszh of their
immense bulk. This season Nebraska
and Missouri met, and while Nev
braska lost 7 to 55, they gsilléd ‘450
yards to 50 for Missouri. Chis gives
some idea of what Jock Sutherland’;
boys are facing on November 12,
All in;aIl bit is a great football

limitations which may be briefly
stated: -

1. “A1iimni,e_duoation*' does not in
any sense imply that the alumni body
should undertake to provide or sun-
plement the technical or professional
training of its members. We cannot.
of course. attempt to increase the
practical efficiency of the alumni in
their chosen vocations.

2. But to university men and
women, "culture," however much the
term has been abused. must always be
important. both from the standpoint
of social responsibility. and 11-om that
of personal enjoyment of the mind
and spirit. The committee feels justl-
ﬁed in assuming. therefore. that any-
thing which tends to broaden or
deepen the intellectual life of’ the
alumni is within the legitimate prov-
ince of its activities. _In this it has
no priggish or pedantic motives. but

‘Will only be sharing‘ In the vast and
, varied movement for adult education,-

which is one of the most conspicuous

_ signs of the times both in Europe and

America. '

3. The committee recognizes that
numerous other 'ag'enclcs. both local
andgnatiollal. are doing valuable work
in this field of adult education, and
it would, be poor economy and poor
co-operation to duplicate functions
which other. agencies are satisfac-
torily performing. It believes, there-
fore. that the alumni should. be urged
in every possible way to utilize the
existing cultural facilities of Pitts-
burgh, including, libraries, lecture

courses, radio studios. etc.

4 Financially. the Association is in
no condition to support large expendi-
tures for alumni education. Anything
that is undertaken must be either
self-supporting. supported by volun-
tary coptrlbutions from members, or
by outside assistance. Believing that
further demands upon the members
are out of the question at this time,
the committee has sought to finance
its activities by other methods.

11. - Leciu-on

The Ilrst type of activity suggested
was a series of public lectures of
graduate calibre. Owing‘ to the dif-
ficulties of publicity and the expense
of bringing a. first class man to intro-
duce such’ a course, the committee
believes it wise to postpone it until
it can be done on an adequate scale.
The idea. has ‘not been abandoned,
however, and is being studied for
future possibilities. Other projects
will be taken up as rapidly as they
prove desirable and practical.

However. the Committee has planned
for some preliminary lectures during
the present year of a, type that can

 ff,’ “MARKS” Z
7 }'1‘he Weekly publishes in» this issue the names
of the students who made the honor roll last
semester on the basis of their high marks and

i .honor roll has always brought forth consider-

A cance of marks in the young and merry life
of the college student.

tracting the least bit from _the. “glory’ of the
 0 osen 8 per cent whom different professors,
each in his different way, thought worthy of
receiving As and Bs, we reprint a paraphrased
parable” from Mirrors of Vanderbilt, as 11-
lustrative of the opinions of the great number
of 0‘ students who were not admitted into the
sacred order of Honor Students: P
 “And they questioned him concerning who
 would be admitted into the /sacred order of Edu-
 cated Men. And he answered them in a parable,
A saying: A certain Teacher had two students. One
or .attended— class and took notes, and put this ‘down
j and underscored that, and read the work assigned,
and on examination put down what the Teacher
 had told him; Now the other student took noinotes
L and used his books to study rather_ than to make
straight marks in, and thought verily on the sub-
 » ject. and on examination said that. which he.
be thought. ’
. “Now what think ye? Which deserves the ,-
 diploma—the ﬁrst or the latter?
« “And they replied, The ﬁrstl -
“For they were professors who had won their
 diplomasby taking notes.” '
F Perhaps, if you can‘ ﬁt yourself into the
parable, you might ﬁnd some consolation.

STUDENTS’ INTEREST IN POLITICS

;Next Tuesday thousands of votes will be cast
-in one of the most important elections in Alle-
gheny and other counties in recent years. It
.-would be extremely interesting to learn What
’;percentage of the hundreds of eligible Pitt
students will take part in the voting. 0
 ‘We venture to say that the number will be
iieglig_ible, notwithstanding the fact that two
or the candidates for judges are Pitt. law
school instructors, a Pitt law student and an-
other a trustee of the University, and that a
most interesting situation has- arisen in the
bitter contest between’Woodside and McGovern
for Allegheny county controller. -

And yet the keen rivalry and issues at stake

in this election are only a few reasons‘ why
students as a group should think, organize and
fact along political lines.‘ In the not distant
future, many of us will enter into the com-
munity life of the town or city we intend to
grace with our presence. \ s
V ‘The European university student is noto-
rious.for= the interest he displays -in the po-
litical life of his community and country. Not
seldom do we hear of European student politi-
cal clubs becoming even too enthusiastic in
their desire to mold public opinion. »
=~ In our educational system discussion of pol-
;‘itlcs= is to be conﬁned to political science classes
or to history or economics hours. ‘ ,
 Bravely, we sometimes get up a .discussion
of the political situation and the students’ re-
lation to’ it in group meetings such as our
forums. At no time, however, is organized
student opinion on politics encouraged in our
American universities, helped along by state
appropriations and looking to “big business“

_ , PUT B1‘ ACROSS. FBOSH  ’
p , Eorum discussion at Pitt, fashioned upon the
.present_Oxford plan of open discussion, was
formally inaugurated two weeks ago, when
neairliy‘ a score of freshmen met with the gradu-
tegmanager of student activities to plan a pro-
‘ram for the coming year. Weekly meetings

re‘}‘now being held. .

T-he'princip_1e of forum discussion is that a
group, bound by some common aim, meets and
discusses problems with some semblance of
parli=amentary procedure or order. In its in-
» ception the forum is usually spontaneous, un-
§OI'g_aIllZeCl and indeﬁnite as to membership.
.»From this amoeba state, it gradually becomes
settled, has a'_deﬁnite procedureaiid organizes
itsf;membei*ship to consist of those who exhibit’
a. sincere interest in its ideals. Such a course
do those who turned out for the initial meet-
ing» hope to follow. .

Wliile we heartily commend the freshmen
foritheir attempt to establish so stable and edu-
i§Cal3_10l1al an extra-curricular.activity as these
open or forum discussions at Pitt, we wonder
why the opportunities which these discussions‘
,holjd should be conﬁned to first-year men.

A DEBUNKUM
Some ‘mortals, praise be, de-
vote themselves to “belittli ”..”
-Though they seldom bring about
reforms or revolutions, they do *
‘keep life from settling into’
“wholesome” mediocrity. This
season our -champion, 0 all-
around belittler, H. L. Mencken,
gives way to the team of‘Stua'rt,
Chase and F. J. Schlink, who
crusade into the realms of

vertising" with Your Money’:
Worth, a study in the "waste of
the consumer’s dollar (Macmil-
lan, $2.00).
All of us are consumers, and
as college students our dollars
‘are ‘none too numerous. Your
Money’s Worth conﬁrms the
suspicions that we are “gypped”
almost every time we lay out
the shekels. We can probably do
nothing about it, but there may M
be some satisfaction in knowing '
that we know we are being
“gy-pped.” .
Instance ‘after instance is
cited to -show that high prices
‘result from expensive advertis-
ing and modern salesmanship,»
that products need not‘ amount
to much if well advertised, that’
most advertising statements- are
not reliable. You inay be sur-
prised to learn that tooth-paste
does not prevent pyorrhea. Ad-
vertisers, realizing that the pub-
lic does not object to being ex-
ploited, are not much worried
about the disclosures, but they
have been nettled sufficiently by
the book to devote considerable
space in their tradepjournals to
prove the authors at fault.’

PSEUDO-INTELLECTLUALS

It _i§:,_,wrongly held‘ by many that
the intellectual writ,esthes'es on “The
Split Inﬁnitive in Beowulf’? or -that
the intellectual is a radical. It is
unjustly claimed that L the purpose

‘ of the intellectual is to teach the

world ‘how to live.

There, have been always and there
are today especially, many men Who,
to cast some light on old writings or

- ta’. ﬁnd proof for present theories,

delve into their particula‘r1investi'ga-
tions. These men are research
workers. They may be intellectual
but they are not necessarily so. Al-
though many agree that specialists

H are not by virtue of their occupation

intellectuals, they insist that the

. radical has this unusual mental

capacity. , _
‘But. usually the radical, the ex-
tremist, is one who follows a leader.

with a_ few others joins. a group. -He
does. not differ from the majority of
the people. Instead of choosing one
leader. he follows another.

The young intellectual is very
scarce. The_ pseudo-intellectual is,»
however, very common. He quotes
Rousseau by the hour; he tries to
write prose like  L. Mencken's,

« poetry lilge Robinson. Jeifers; and he

-plays’ chess "because it is‘ generally
believed to take more brains than
poker’ c._loes.- Speak to him. of
women. he will quote Schopenhauer;
mention religion, he will repeat
Voltaire; in general,‘ pic philosophy
is a copy of Nietzsche’s._
haabeen widely read is all very true,
but that he is entirely iml-tative-—
that he.‘ has-no‘ opinions that he him-
self has thought out and‘ believes for
certain, is that which separates him
from the true intellectual. -

This pseudo-intellectual is con-
stantly feollng . dejected. He is a
hind oi neurotic for he,won’t try to
behappy as he gets a certain morbid
pleasure out of being: gloomy. He
scolfs at his parents, pedagogues,

‘and the people in O general, and

thinks them, panes of glass through
which his" shrewd eyes detect dod-
dering‘ lapses iromrsouud sense. ’

mun; who follows a leader, quotes
‘philosopher-s," sneer: ‘ at his fellow
beings, and prefers to be blue.

But he, who besides having great
intelligence. has acquired much

.learning and has also an -unusual

mental capacity, is an intellectual.
The . intellectual does not nccegg.
sarily have to. ‘be an atheist, a so-

‘ cialist, or a neurotic. He may be-

1.0118‘ to 8- ‘church, agree with the
majority, be a fraternity man, and
Play football. He does not write
cadenced verse unless he really feels
it. and he certainly does not display

though he may show it to a. few
close friends. Those things -which he
really‘ believes do not have to bore-
vealed toany passcﬁby. -

_ The only way‘ we can show. how
‘rare the true intellectual is, is to
draw the proportion that the intel-
lectual is to the genius what the
‘gifted is to the talented.

Beagle conce'r,ts;. the artist wag Be-

niamino‘ Giglie of the Metropolitan.
It was Gigli’s_ first pappearance in
Pittsburgh, but his fa‘me,had pre-
ceded him.‘ A great crow‘cl, one of
thsllargest.,.wo have overseen intbe

Mosque at a recital, was to‘ hear‘ “the
logical successor of Caruso.” They

came expecting to hearivgreat sing-‘

ing; they heard it and_appreciated it.

Gigli gave us. arias from. standard
tragedies and singleqsongs ranging
from Pergolesi and Gluck to one by

his accompanist, Vito Carnevali. ‘
Whatdoes it »rr1att_er,_ifjhe did add a ,
tfow ‘ vocal decorations ‘Z.

We must
say that .half of Italian singing is

the decorations. _Oi.’* all he sang we

prefer‘ the “M’Appari” from Martha
and‘ _ Pergolesi’s “Nina,’? although
We".-must admit the charm of his
“Pulcinclla” encore. His voice was

technically ‘ perfect and his stage »

personality disarmingly naive.
, The assisting,‘ artist, Miss Anne
Tyson, we ‘heard at as great dis-

advantage. The aria of Tschaikove '

ski’s with which she opened her first
groupof songs promised much, but
we were bitterly disappointed. If
she had sung under different condi-
tions or had chosen another group of
songs, wepwould feel safe to pass a

judg_ment—-but as it was, we have _

no opinions. _ ,  ,

The Allegheny team comes, to
Pittsburgh with a perfect‘ record
