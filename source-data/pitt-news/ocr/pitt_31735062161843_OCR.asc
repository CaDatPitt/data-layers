each and the’ individual depart-

" tzient can also choose to award-
credits to. the teaching fellow.

Awardees-are not equivalent to
graduate 7 teaching assistants or
fellows but. according to CAS Dean

Nominations from faculty mem-
bers are due Friday, November 16.
They should include:
1) A short (1 page) statement from
the nominating faculty member
explaining how the student is toibe
involved in the course and why this
particular stttdent is being nomin-
ated. ‘ .
2) A short statement from the
nominated student concerning why

Door-to-Door Bus Service

BY RITA VITOLO

A computerized “Dial-a-Ride"
mass-transit system which lets
travelers order instant door-to;door
bus service by phone is being
studied by two Pitt engineering
professors.

Drs. Marlin Mickle _and William
Vogt, of the electrical engineering
department, are working with a
$59,981 grant from the Urban Mass
Transportation Administration of
the U.S. Department of Transpor-

'tation. .
The system is not an alternative to ‘

Skybus, or any other rapid transit
proposal. Dial-a-Ride, Mickle
stressed, is a mass-transit program
designed especially to move “a lot
of people fairly short distances
without a great waste of time.”
Explaining no plans exist at
present for implementing a Dial-a-
Ride system in Pittsburgh, Mickle
speculated on some possibilities.
“A system like Dial-a-Ride could
possibly feed into Skybus or one of

\ the proposed Patways. It would be
' most

useful in the outlying
Pittsburgh areas, either through
bringing ' riders to established

An experimental Dial-a-Ride is
now functioning in I Haddonfield,
New Jersey, explained Vogt, with
24-hour, daily service throughout
the surrounding neighborhoods.

If a person wants service he calls a

' dispatcher, who then send a vehicle

to the pickup address. Waiting
time is normally 10-20 minutes
after placing the call; Dial-a-Ride
will wait 30 seconds at your door.

Fares are 60 cents per ride, with_

20 cent discounts for senior citizens
and groups of three or more.

In their research, Mickle and Vogt
will compare this real-world opera-
tion with data from a computer-
simulated Dial-a-Ride. One of the
drawbacks in the Haddonfield
system is its inefficiency in
handling large numbers of calls.

Presently, Mickle said, Dial-a-
Ride carries “about 800-1000
passengers per~day.” - More

extensive computerization of the
system is necessary, he and Vogt
contend, before the sytem can be
effective in larger markets.

\UAR editor Phil Keryan felt

political prisoners,‘ the ‘present
political repression in Chile, and
related issues."

Rich Tarquinio, chairman of

Student Govemment’s Committee‘

on Student Organizations [CSO],
said “We recommend to the
Student Government Board that
they deny the Chile group
recognition because we felt the
Chile issue was a short term issue
and that the goals outlined in their
constitution were limited and could
be covered by working with Young
Socialist Alliance [YSA].

“We won't recognize limited
groups because we feel many
splinter groups will decrease the
effectiveness of other student
organizations."

Ginny Burke, acting president of.

the Ad Hoc Committee on Chile,
refuted CSO’s reasons for denying

. recognition.

“They don’t have the powerto
foresee how long the Chilean issue
will continue,” she said. “We are

not Socialists,” she added. "We -I 
are a non-partisan organization and 7 ‘ I

we don’t want to work with YSA.”
John Beverly, faculty advisor for

Hitchhi

BY RITA VITOLO

Editor’s note: The 12 University of 1
Pittsburgh student recipients of’

Nationality Room Scholarships for
summer study, abroad ‘recently

- discussed their experiences in the

lifestyles of Colombia, "Mexico,
Scandinavia, Great Britain. and
Europe.

One of these, Ken Krenicky,
winner of the Farmer Memorial’
Award. studied at the University of

 Edinburgh, Scotland. During that

. were

time. he hitchhiked into Belfast,
the capital of Northern Ireland.

“I was traveling with a friend
from South Carolina;' he was
Protestant, and I’m Catholic. Now,
I couldn’t care less what religion
you or anybody is, but in Belfast, it
matters. The feeling of what you
are is there, it’s real.

We planned to turn the trip into a
paper for the course we were taking
in Edinburgh, so we planned to ask
a lot of questions--we were looking

' for a hard-core Protestant opinion,
I a hard-core Catholic opinion, and a
sort of a middle-of-the-road one.

“We had maps, streets ‘and

‘ areas that people said we should

stay away from," Krenicky ex-
plained. -

“An American passport turned,

out to be the best thing I had. They
suspicious of these two
Americans asking questions, we
could never go up-to anlrishman
and begin toj_a_sk questions directly,
we'd have to bullshit for awhile,

ask them about their families, thueg A

 

kids. They wanted to know why
you're asking’ them these ‘ques-
tions. just who the hell. you are."

Little «antagonism was shown
towards them because ;they were

‘Americans Krenicky maintained. '

“The only anti-American feeling
we got was on the first night we
were there, from the first woman

we met as a matter of fact. She ran -
"a B & B, a» bed-and-breakfast

where we were going to spend the
night.

“When she found out that we
were Americans, the first thing she
asked us was ‘Why don't you
Americans clean up your Water-
gate?‘

“We stayed for awhile with some
doctors and‘ nurses we met in ~

Belfast--they were an academic,
med-school group. From them, I’d
say that the animosity in Northern
Ireland is pretty well controlled, at
least on an academic level.
“There you’re dealing with
people who are more educated and
better off ﬁnancially then most, you
can talk rationally about an issue.
The feeling is that they're very
tired of all the fighting, and that
it’s a small percentage of radicals
causing the problems.
“Generally, "the less educated
and poorer you are in Northern
Ireland, the closer you are to the
fighting, and the more bitter is the
Protestant-Catholic "feeling. .
“Everyone there is ‘searched,
they plant bombs on kids even, so

department stores hire guards and "

Pittsburgh is getting a total-
community radio station.

The station is WYEP, 91.5 FM
on your’s or anybody’s dial. It will
be run by volunteers and interested
listeners, with_ a skeleton staff
filling the support positions.

These people hope to bring a
new kind of radio to
city--innovative and fresh--with a
solidly’ community-oriented out-
look.

The directors of the station,
Jeffery Smith and John Schwartz,
are determined to break the mold
of the media. Smith feels the new

station will fill a need in this city,‘
despite an abundance of radio
stations. '

He sees the station as a
community venture, totally sup-
-ported by the listeners. The policy

‘ of the station will be “If you’re not

getting what you want, you can

A ,_ come down to the station and make

it happen.”

The station will concentrate on
community-interest events, with
discussion and talk shows rounding
out local news issues. The music

varied as the listeners, from

libertarians. We don’t see the
issue" as ‘traditionalists’ vs. ‘liber-
tarians’, but rather “,leftist’ and
‘status quo’ groups, which tend to
be authoritarian, vs YAF,” Merit-
zer emphasized.

What is the YAF position on
some of today’s major issues?
Meritzer: first pointing out that the
leadership of an organization tends
to be more homogenous than its

have a transmitting range of 15-20
miles.

The van is being paid for by the
Thomas Paine Fund of St. Louis,‘
which donated use of the van and
an additional $10,000 to the
project.

Both Smith and Schwartz see a
distinct difference in what they are

going to offer the community. The

station is designed to make it
sensitive to the feelings of the
community. and the‘ needs of the
city.

According to Schwartz. its aim is
to evoke comment and reaction

felt that he didn’t keep his
promises. Although there was no
collective endorsement of Nixon in
‘72 there was a collective opposi-
tion to McGovern,” he said.
Watergate has left its mark on
the YAF. he noted. “We're more
hostile toward Nixon. feeling that
the first and sixth amendment
freedoms are crucial. We would be
happy if he resigned..but there
hasn‘t been a collective move for

_ impeachment." he stated.

He said that Watergate is living

ment and he predicts’ that in the ‘76
election there will be a rally around
the “traditionalis_ts” because

audience.

The emphasis of the program
Schwartz noted, “is the involve-
ment of the audience. Instead of
being one way it’s going to be a lot
more open, a two-way feedback.”

Smith and Schwartz both com-
mented that most of the funding for
the project would come from
subscriptions to the station. But
they were quick to addthey needed
more than money from the
audience.

“People find it hard to catch on
that we’re going to do it." said
Smith. “When the station goes on
the air it's going to be a hell of a lot
of fun."

less with the other two parties." he
said.

On the\international level,
Meritzer said that the YAF was not
united about the U.S. role in

,;\rl

Vietnam, noting, “Traditionalists

supported the war, but the great
majority--libertarians--remained
silent. I think that
‘pro-peace’ movement

Moving to'the Middle East, he
stated that t'he'YAF is 100% in
support of Israel. “We believe that
a democracy is better than military
dictatorship and Israel is the only
democracy between Rome and New
Delhi. Democracy is far from
perfect. but it's a step in the right
direction.’ he concluded.

George Nama, Artist of C:reaiVarieiy B

BY ALAN CONANT '

The sculpture and prints of
George Nama will run through next
week at the Kingpitcher gallery on
S. Craig St. The show includes his
bronze, aluminum sculpture and
lithographic, intaglio, and seri-
graph prints. The wide variety of
prints on display are the inspiration
for Nama’s series of sculpture.

Aluminum and bronze were the
principal materials used in his
“Monument” series of sculpture.
“Monument II”. composed of two
metal bars held and bent together
by cable, shows tension well and is
interesting in its appearance of
roughness and metal under stress.
The most interesting of his
sculpture pieces was #8, “Rope
disc Fracture”. Standing about
two feet high, it includes various
pieces of aluminum joined at
different angles and then painted.
A circular piece of bronze, cross
cut, is joined but_ left unpainted-—
showing to good effect a contrast
between finished and unfinished
metals. ’

Ropes binding and cutting is a
theme repeated in his series of

painted heads. The figurative
heads are bound four ways and the
bindings fracture the heads. They
are interesting for that effect but
other than that they have no strong
point.

The artist's finest works, by far,
are his lithographs. The “Ballet
Series” are four intaglio prints that
are ingenious. In a free. relaxed
manner brilliant hues are brought
together to create a very dynamic
series of prints. “Ballet Series”
#1. an Artist’s Proof. and #4 are the
most attractive and are easily worth
an hour of your time to look at. -

A number of other
untitled, include mixed media.
Print # 24, very similar to “Rope
disc Fracture”, is well executed
and has the same fine attributes as
the sculpture. Perhaps the most
interesting print is #32, an Artist’s

.Proof, done in 1973 as are all the

other prints. This eight color
lithograph shows the finest color
modulations in the entire show.

The same bright, c-risp style is ,

also evident in the linoleum'cuts;
all of them studies of air, land, and
water, five -prints of each are

Air-‘Force Rep. Declares‘

BY GEORGE ZRUST

Blacks are still likely to encouter
some academic difficulties in the
U.S. Air Force, according to
Lieutenant William Thompson, a
black Air Force Minority Affairs
advisor.

Tliompson.la 1973 graduate of the

Air Force Academy. was in
Pittsburgh this week recruiting
prospective candidates for career
officer training at the Colorado
academy. His agenda included
seven /predominately black area
schools and a conference at Pitt
Saturday morning.

“The black is going to have some
problems," Thompson said in an
“I had 1200 on my

Merit student in high school, and
had college preparatory courses.
But I had academic problems.’
“I grew up in the South, in an
all-black educational system. I
could compete in my region, but
Thompson, a
native .of Orangeburg, South
Carolina, said he got his problems
“straightened out.”

Nationally blacks make up 14% of
the "Air Force’s enlisted corps‘ and
onlyl2% ofits officers, according to
Thompson. - . '

Capt. Stanley Beyens, a Pitt Air

blacks are well-represented in the.

T finds temporary satisfaction in

of the play ends with Clay7s'

enlightenment through the wisdom

of a character called The Prophet,‘

the first sign of the tree’s
blooming. '

In, the" production, there are no
props. just hurnan beings. There's
no traditional stage setting, just ‘an
advantageous empty Studio Thea-

tre.‘ The costuming is limited. The;

actors are all identified in the
program simply by number except
for Telmachus and The Prophet.
The ' numbered actors are all
dressed in drab greens, blues, and
blacks; lost among each other and
therefore easily able to play the
many different characters they do.
Telemachus. dressed in bright
yellow, and The Prophet, dressed
in white. are the ‘only constant
characters throughout the‘ play.

left the tree as nothing but a dried

a strange tree,,it shoots directly

‘from seed to blossoms. With each

experience, Telemachus changes,
but Trahanis’s reactions are all

similar--facially. physically, and
vocally.
Often, in this situation, the

author is at fault as he tells us that
a‘ character is “such and such’?
instead of showing us that he really
is “such and such”. In this case
though, author Lewis John Carlino,
has properly timed the needed

‘experiences with “untelling” dia- .

logue such that if the presentation
of the character has this speciﬁc
problem, the actor is at fault.
When Telemachus is not por-
trayed properly, the play produc-
tion suffers. Since Telemachus is
the only developing character
within the play, the play must move

' and be directed along his develop-

ment.

The production is successful,

Pittiis going to a bowl game_. Itwill probably be the Fiesta Bowl,
which is played in Phoenix, Arizona, December 21st.fThe only thing .
that will keep Pitt out‘of. a bowl game is losing to Army. 

This prediction, which wouldhave been deemed absurd at the start of
the season, can be justified by running down the bowl games and
competing teams. I-will considerjall teams that received votes in AP’s
top “twenty poll, in which Pitt lost its 20th spot but still’ received votes._

Big Ten and Paciﬁc ‘Eight teams can piay' only in the Rose Bowl. This - 1

. eliminatestfrom Pitt's competition Ohio State, Michigan, UCLA, USC,

and Stanford.

The Sugar Bowl seems certain to pit Alabama against 'Notr_e Dame, 1 I

"and Penn State will_ play LSU in the Orange Bowl. The Cotton Bowl is
shaping up as a Nebraska-Texas confrontation. Oklahomais ineligible

due to recruiting violations. .-

The Liberty Bowl has strongly hinted that it would like to see Kansas

play North Carolina State. The Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune reports a
that Missouri will play Auburn in the Sun Bowl. I - ‘ L

r

Now’s where things get a little confusing.‘ Tulane has decidedito play

in the Blue-Bonnet ‘Bowl.

Houston looms as the opponent. -

‘ The winner of the Arizona-A_rizona’State game will be one of the '
teams in the Fiesta Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl committee had wanted
Houston‘ as the other, but Pitt is the next choiee according to the _
Orlando [Florida] Sentinel, and as I said, Houston is leaning toward the

V ' BIue-Bonnet Bowl.

The other top teams also will go to bowls.‘ Miami of Ohio will play in

‘V the Tangerine Bowl. . This leaves Texas Tech, Tennessee, Colorado and

Oklahoma Stateto ﬁll the four spots which remain open, two each in

‘the Gator and Peach ‘Bowls.

Even if Pitt doesn’t go to the'FiestaiBowl, it will go somewhere. If a
new team should make the top-twenty next week, remember that Pitt

._has more going forit than any otherpsclhool rated near it.‘
' THE BIG THREE _ v S 1 .
Pitt has three things going for it. First, Johnny Majors’ name and

reputation will attract fans.’ Second, although not "necessarily in
importance, is Tony Dorsett. No team in the country has a more '
exciting player. The third pro- Panther factor is that it is the only school
up for contention, except for Penn State. which is fromithe East, and
the East is where the television market is, ' ’ '

Pitt needs only to beat Army to go to a Bowl. The bids will be out long ‘
before _the.Pen.n State game. Should Army win Saturday, it will be the

I greatest catastrophy in Pitt football history. ‘ ' . L

‘New York City, NY—-The IC4A
Cross Country Championships
finalized Pitt's cross country
season for 1973,*on a promising
. performance by ﬁve underclass-
;.?men‘.‘ New York's University of
Manhattan retained its IC4A title.
It-Panther mentor Jim Banner was
pleased with his team's 11th place

 

” “that had few disappointments for
7 such a ﬁne young team. V

‘Y Nick Martin ran the fastest,Pitt

i‘lC4A time ever when he lowered

’ t former Pitt All American and close
 friend Jerry Richie’s 24 minutes 47
‘ second time by 15 seconds: 24
9 minutes .32 seconds for five [5]
iniles of country terrain: an average
of 4 minutes 54.6 seconds per mile.
Bob Steele ran second for Pitt with
a— highly respectable 25:15 race.
“Bob has improved steadily ‘all

with an ‘as expected’ improved‘

 ﬁnish in a highly competitive race .

performance," Coach Banner re-
marked. ' '
The youngest‘ of the Banner
Babies, freshman Terry .Wile,
ﬁnished ahead of all freshmen
entries" with a 26 minute effort.
Banner maintains that, “Terry is
making a splendid transition from
two mile high school racing to the

.ﬁve-six mile big time racing.”

Mickey Collins had a trying
season and a long afternoon at the
IC4A’s as he registered a poor
performance finished fourth team
wise; that is certain to motivate his
preparation for the upcoming
indoor track season.

An improved Rich Markely
capped a ﬁne season with a time of
26 minutes. Markely in his first
cross counry season ever, has
proven himself to be more than a
half miler and adds to the overall
strength of Pitt's distance team.

Pitt's cross country season has

. provided a preview of what appears

to be one of the best years yet for
Pitt Track. With a duel meet log of
4-1, a second place at Canasuis
Relays, and an eleventh place at
the east coast ﬁnals, Banner’s
Babies are beginning to bloom.

o 6. Raiders  Again

BY RICK STOUFFER

The Red Raiders, in a tune up for
their coming clash with
Quitters, defeated a tough EOS
team 24-8 in a game closer than the
score suggests.

The ﬁrst play of the game went
bad for EOS. A strong rush by the
Raiders McGinley forced "EOS into
their‘ own endzone for a two point
safety. . '

The Raiders took over on the free
kick moving well. Dunn hit

Murhammer with a screen picking .

up good yardage. But EOS held
and on fourth and two, the Raiders
chose to punt- _

EOS started moving well on a pass
from Reynolds to halfback Schard
coming out of the backfield for an [I
yard gain. Then it was “the Big
Red” defense’s turn to hold EOS
for threéidowns. EOS went for the
field goal but it was wide left with
the score remaining 2-0. '

Dunn, using the sneak, broke for

an eight yard gain. With third and.

two Dunn hit Morrison picking up
good yardage then lateraling to
McGonley who carried to the five.

The Raiders were ready to run it
in with four plays to score. But
EOS rose to the occasion. Two
plays could pick up no yardage and
on‘ thirdand goal Schard blew

throughfor EOS. to sack Dunn. On,

fourth and ten, Dunn decided to go
for the score. Dropping back he
ﬁred to the left corner but the pass
was dropped to end the scoring

the-

‘C out on first

drive.

With 30 seconds left in the half,
EOS took over. They could not
score in two plays leaving the. score
at the half: Red Raiders 2 EOS 0.

The Raiders came out “smokin”

to start the second half. With first '

and ten. Dunn dropped back
throwing to McGinleyito make the
score 8-0. The conversion was
good upping thescore to 10-0.
EOS'took the ensuing kickoff and
moved up the ﬁeld. With the ball
on the 50, Schard couldn't ﬁnd any
of his receivers open so he tucked
the ball away and ran. Trying to
cut upﬁeld, he lost his footing and
fell on the Astroturf twisting his
knee. The injury seemed to_ spark
EOS as they put on a steady drive
capped by a 20 pass from Reynolds
for a touchdown. The kick, was
good and the score stood.
Showing good hustle and deter-
mination, the Raiders came alive.
Loskot took, the kickoff getting all
the way to. the 45 before being
stopped. Dunn brought his team
and ten hitting
Morrison with a quick screen down
to the five. =
Two passing plays ‘by Dunn
gained zero yardage but on third
and goal, Dunn rolled right and
then threw to Mcginley in the left
corner of the endzone for the score.
The kick was good and-the Raiders
led 18-8. »
EOS wasted no time moving in
