  Students
reflect on

Boston  
attack 1

After ﬁnishing the Boston Mara-
thon on Monday, Vincent Chavanon
walked past the ﬁnish line to Mc-
Greevy’s, a bar located between
mile 26 of the 26.2 mile race and
the ﬁnish line. The fourth-year
Pitt medical student planned to
watch the ﬁnishing stretch of the

' "Marathon from the bar with some

buddies when he heard two loud
bangs ‘outside. At ﬁrst, he and his

friends didn’t think much of it until . ,

they saw police, ﬁretrucks and am-
bulances speeding downgBoylston

V’ Street to the ﬁnish line.

“It was all a wild swing of emo-

tions, since we were celebrating the

ﬁnish, cheering other runners on,

. and then all of a sudden everyone

ran to the windows to get a look at
what was happening,” Chavanon
said. “We were all pretty shaken
up after that happened. Quite a
few people were crying and-walk-
ing away from the ﬁnish.”

By now, the events that Cha-
vanon witnessed are known to be
a terrorist attack at the Boston
Marathon. At approximately_2g:50
pm. on Monday, two bombs went
off about 10 seconds apart by the
intersections of Boylston and Exeter
streets in downtown Boston. Run-
ners and spectators were impacted
by the blasts, which left more than
170 people injured and three dead,
including an 8-year-old boy. At least
nine individuals affiliated with Pitt

Zach Virshup didn’t intend to

speak to the nine members of
_ Student Government Board last

night, but after hearing his peers
express their frustration with the
way Student Government.Board
elections are run, he delivered
an unprepared speech.

The junior said that he at-
tempted to run in the last elec-
tion, but when he saw the list of
candidates and the slates they

had formed, he knew his only i

hope of winning a seat was forg-
ing campaigning alliances of his
own.

“When I tried to go at it, it was
very intimidating and unnatu-

' ral,” Virshup said.

Unfortunately, he received
only one uninterested response
to emailed requests to other un-
allied candidates seeking to form
a slate.

“I have a 0 percent chance of
getting on Board if I’m not on a
slate,” Virshup said.

 

Virshup, who didn’t end up
running in‘ the election,was just
one of many vocal students at
N ordy’s Place last night for SGB’s
ﬁnal public meeting of the se-
mester, which experienced an

unusually high turnout. About-

75 people sitting and standing
around the lounge and stage
area listened to the usual meet-
ing proceedings before about 10
students stood up to share their
own thoughts with the room dur-
ing the open—fl_oor portion of the
meeting.

ran in the marathon. The Pitt News could
not conﬁrm the status of all nine marathon
participants.

“It was a bit of a controlled chaos as every-
one tried to get out of the area,” Chavanon said
of the explosions’ aftermath. “People were
visibly shaken up, angry and crying as we left.”

Though the explosions went off in Boston,
their emotional reverberations have reached

all the way to campus through the effect they ,

have had on those who ran in the marathon
and Pitt students who call Boston home.

Pitt sophomore Hannah Maleson, who
hails from Boston, found out about the bomb-
ings a little after 3 p.m. through friends on
Facebook. After seeing footage of the attacks
on the news, Maleson describes it as “both
horrifying and humbling.”

"As a Bostonian, and furthermore, an
American, I deﬁnitely have a bubble effect
where I don’t think that this could happen
in my city,” Maleson said. “Perhaps the fear
would have been more real if I were at home,

as opposed to Pittsburgh. I am still kind of '

in shock.”

Pitt freshman Gordon Hall, who is also

from Boston, shared feelings similar to Male-
son’s.

“It deﬁnitely rattles me to think about what
went on in my hometown on Monday,” Hall
said. “It feels good knowing that everyone
that '1 know is safe, but at the same-time, it’s
upsetting to think of those that were injured
and especially the three that were killed.”

“I feel a little homesick now,” Hall ex-
plained. “It would be much better to be back
with family and friends to get through these
tough times with them.”

Bostonians across the nation have demon-

strated a strong sense of resiliency since Mon-

day’s attack. Those at Pitt are no exception.
In spite of his proximity to the attacks,

Chavanon, who attended Tufts University in

Boston as an undergraduate, said he wouldnit‘

hesitate to run the Boston Marathon again.

“Boston was my home for four years as
an undergrad. It’s terrifying to think I was so
close to what happened, and that we didn’t
know if it would happen again,” Chavanon
said. “That being said, I do feel safe here and
would be happy to come back to Boston and
to race again.,The explosions were a tragedy
that marred what was otherwise an amazing
day and an incredible event.”

Chavanon knows that these kinds of at-

. tacks are always a possibility. “I don’t want

to live in fear of thinking that something
might happen,” he said. “But knowing that
crowded areas were targeted like that is quite
discomforting.” -
Maleson watched the Marathon as a spec-
tatorin the past and said this tragedy will not
cause her to hesitate to attend again. 1‘
“Marathon Monday brings back great
memories for me, and I have every intention

in participating in the festivities inﬁhe years .

following,” she said.

President Barack Obama addressed the
nation following the tragedy in a televised
speech Monday evening. a

“All Americans stand with the people of
Boston,” Obama said. “We still do not know
who did this or why. Make no mistake — we

. will get to the bottom of this. We will ﬁnd

out who did this. We will ﬁnd out why they
did this.”

Maleson said that although it was nice to »

hear the president’s compassionate words
about Boston, she doesn’t need much reas-
surance. “I know I come frorna strong city
with deep roots, and this tragedy won’t break
us,” Maleson said. I

Pitt receives a ‘C’ on lglobalhealthreport card ,

Shruti Revankar
Staff Wrz'ter

Pitt is a nationally renowned research uni-
versity, and many see it as a moving force
when it corries to medical treatments for
many diseases that run rampant in our so-
ciety. But a recently compiled global health
report card may shatter this perception.
According to the" University Global
Health Impact Report Card released earlier

this month, Pitt is ranked 13th out of the 54 -

top research universities in North America

and received an overall grade of “C.”
This report card is a project conducted

by Universities Allied for Essential Medi-

_ cines (UAEM) ‘and seeks to provide letter_
grades to universities in three key cat- T

_egories: innovation, access and empower-

ment. Pitt received a D, B and a B+ in each
of these categories, respectively. UAEM is
primarily composed of graduate and un-'
dergraduate students who are interested
in related ﬁelds such as medicine, research
and law. The report card_was conceived,
developed and produced by these students.

Bryan Collinsworth, executive director
at UAEM, said in an email that institutes
like Pitt provide meaningful contributions
to various fields of research.

“There are many ways that universities
impact global health, but their roles as
major non-proﬁt, publicly funded medical
research institutions ‘is the most impor-
tant ~—- and the most overlooked,” he said.

Collinsworth said that the report card

focuses on the aspects of _global health
that have received the least attention and

where there are clear and practical ways '

to improve. .

Donald Burke, dean of the Graduate

School of Public Health, warned in an email
that “the survey was cobbled together by a
well—meaning but naive group of students,
so the results must be taken with a grain
of salt.” , .

UAEM dictates that universities must
invest in innovative research that focuses
on the neglected health needs of those who
live in low-income communities in order

to score highly in the innovation category. I

According to the project website, lack of
interest in this ﬁeld is a growing problem
because over a billion people a year suffer

from “neglected diseases.” The private "

sector rarely researches these diseases

v because a market supported by low-income

communities is not lucrative.

For this particular category, UAEM fo-
cused on the percentage of Pitt’s funding
from 2010 that went toward research and
infrastructure dedicated to neglected dis-
eases. According to their website, only 3.01
percent of funding went toward neglected-
diseases "research and no funding went
toward a building devoted to this type of
research.

Burke thinks otherwise.

“Researchers at P_itt are dedicated to

‘ﬁghting infectious diseases, including

sions to the Elections Code, which were
tabled for a week prior to last night’s
meeting. , A

The Board faced two different options
in addressing how to improve the current

, elections system. One option was Gish’s

slew of revisions that were proposed last
week, which include the abolishment of
slates in favor of all interested students
running independently. V

Gish spoke to the Board directly during

his report prior to the vote, stating that the
Coderevisions incorporate several of the
Board’s ideas and further challenging the
members to provide constructive criticism
on ideas they did not agree with.

“On other issues, you have simply sat

in a room with me for hours and berated‘
my committee’s ideas and stances,” he said

to the Board. “That does not constitute
constructive criticism.”

Board memberjohn Cordiersaid dur-
ing the meeting that Gish misrepresented
the way the meetings went.

“We provide criticism, but we also pro-

vide ways to improve things,” Cordier said _

after the meeting.

Cordier said that he and the Board
have been very willing to compromise,
while Gish has remained insistent on the
changes recommended unanimously by

C his Elections Committee.

Board member Dave Rosenthal said the

Board hadn’t had time to consider all of
Gish’s proposed changes to the Election
Code because it had not been informed of
the changes prior to Gish’s first reading of
them in public meeting last week.

Upon hearing the revisions, Rosenthal
said he did not agree with the changes in
their entirety.

Gish said that his committee did not

C present the elimination of the slate sys-

tem before public meeting because his
committee had not felt comfortable ap-
proaching the issue of eliminating slates
until the committee meeting before the
public meeting where he introduced it.
Gish said his Elections Committee met
bi-weekly with growing frequency as the
situation developed. _

“Discussions of the slate system have
evolved since the beginning of the semes-
ter,” Gish said.

A second option was to support Gov-
ernmental Relations Committee Chairman
Robert Beecher’s introduction of a petition
toamend the SGB Constitution and reduce
the number of candidates students can
vote for in SGB elections from six to four.

“The problem with thesystem now
is that it creates a supermajority on the
Board when it comes to making propo-
sitions,” Beecher said. “If we give each
person three votes, that will override
the supermajority problem, becauseany
proposition made would have to come
from someone else.” 4

The Board opted to support Beecher’s
proposal on how to eliminate the prob-

lem of slates allowing groups of people to
sweep elections, which was ﬁrst brought
to the public’s attention last’ night.

If Beecher gets 5 percent of the under-
graduate student body to sign his petition,
then it will be added to the 2013 SGB elec-
tion ballot as a referendum for students
to vote on.

A referendum may be introduced to
the student body through either a petition
drive, requiring the signature of 5 percent
of non—College of General Studies u_nder-
graduates, or through a recommendation
by a Constitutional Review Committee
selected by the Board.

According to Beecher, the current
Board has elected to introduce the ref-
erendum via petition to raise student
awareness and lend greater credibility to
the movement. The Board decided to an-
nounce the launch at this time to promote
transparency in regard to their intentions,
and begin building a broad coalition of
student groups to ensure this reform is
passed in November.

If the referendum earns enough sup-
port ffom the student body, it will be
placed on the ballot in the fall. At that
time, students would be able to vote for
the opportunity to retain the current vot-
ing system or approve Beecher’s vision, in
which each student would be allowed to
vote for only three Board members and
a president. -

Rosenthal said he is in full support of
Beecher’s petition for a referendum.

ing for,” Rosenthal said, following the
meeting. “I ran on an independent slate,
so I know how challenging it can be against
megaslates, but I do not think that elimi-
nating the [slate] system as a whole would
be effective.”

Rosenthal said that he did not think
limiting students to three votes would
limit their efficacy.

“Limiting ‘students to three votes would
not harm them. As it stands, allowing stu-
dents to vote for five Board members and
a president gives them a disproportionate
amount of voting power,” Rosenthal said.
“If I’m in the Democratic Party, then I’m
going to listen to people who vouch for
other candidates in the party. So slates
work as a mental heuristic.”

After the meeting, Beecher said the
petition has so far received 31 signatures.

' Gish was supportive of Beecher’s refer-
endum and said it would prove inﬂuential
in future elections, but that he would not
let it influence his proposed cha"nges'to
the Elections Code, which could impact
the upcoming election. ’ l

“The referendum should not affect the
Elections Committee votes on this code
because it won’t be in effect until next
year,” Gish said.

Board member Thomas Jabro said
following the meeting that while he has
vowed to put his support behind Beecher’s
proposal, he sees it as an “excellent com-

GLOBAL

some of the most neglected, through sound
scientiﬁc work,” he said.

_Collinsworth said the best route uni-
versities can take toward improving these
rankings is to place new emphasis on ne-
glected diseases. A

“Universities can start by directing
more resources towards these rarely re-
searched diseases that affect so many low-
income patients worldwide — including
neglected aspects of HIV, tuberculosis and
malaria, but" also Chagas disease, dengue
fever and many others,” he said.

Burke said that Pitt is involved in- cut-
ting-edge research regarding many infec-
tious diseases. According to him, f‘the Uni-
versity is among the nation’s.top-funded

institutions for research into HIV/AIDS and '

our Center for Vaccine Research is at the
forefront of discovering novel treatments
for infectious diseases, including dengue,
tuberculosis, malaria and Rift Valley fever.

Collinsworth said that UAEM used the,

’ G—Finder database, a comprehensive _sur-

vey of worldwide funding for neglected dis-
eases. He said that it is publicly searchable,
so anyone can look up the information for
which grants were and were not included‘
under each university.

~ He said that UAEM uses this same da-
tabase to establish a specificfinclusive

and empirically grounded deﬁnition of -

“neglected diseases,” since this definition

April 17, 2018 I The Pitt News I vvx/\/vv.pitlnevvs.com '

seems to vary among universities.

“For these reasons, we consider the
G—Finder a ‘gold standard’ data source
for both deﬁning neglected diseases and
cataloging the extent of research in these
areas, and UAEM relied heavily on it for

both_ purposes in developing our own’

evaluation,” Collinsworth said.

Collinsworth is conﬁdent that although
this G—Finder data isn’t 100 percent fool-
proof, it is the most rigorous and com-
prehensive record of neglected-disease
research funding available at this time.

Burke said that many of the resources
for Pitt’s researchcome from competitive
grants from other agencies. However, he
said that funding for neglected diseases is
limited. Pitt currently gets funding from
the National Institutes of Health, the Gates
Foundation and other institutions.

Collinsworth offers some advice on
steps that _a university can take in order
to gain more funding for research on ne-
glected diseases. _“Hiring faculty with ex-
pertise in these areas, supporting young
students and researchers and establishing
dedicated neglected-disease labs are key
ﬁrst steps that can draw more funding in
the future,” he said.

“While I applaud this student—run orga-
nization for its passion in raising aware-
ness of neglected diseases, this report
card is flawed on many fronts, primarily
due to the methodology used in issuing
the surveys and compiling the results,”
Burke said. . -

In addition to the G—Finder database,
the UAEM study also utilized the NIH Re-
PORTER database, among others.

Burke believes that there were limita-
tions with data sources used to answer
some of the questions. He ‘said that the NIH
RePORTER database was used to obtain
the data. He also ﬁnds the methodology
ﬂawed because, according to him, some
data was obtained by reviewing websites
where the content can vary in terms of
substance and accuracy. A

“With any survey of this nature, it’s
important to ﬁnd the most comprehensive,
accurate and credible source of informa-
tion,” he said.

/But innovation was only one of three
categories that comprised the survey.

For a high score in the “access” catego-
ry, a university should take steps to ensure
that any medical treatments that result

from their breakthroughs are accessible to.

patients worldwide at an affordable cost.
Pitt received a B in this category.

The major component in this category
was commitment to health access.-The
report card gave only 2.5 out of a possible
12.5 points to Pitt because “the university
has made no official public commitment
to access licensing.”

UAEM also evaluated each of the top
universities in a ﬁnal category: empow-
erment. To be successful in this category,
universities must have educated the next
generation of leaders on the potential im-
pact that academic institutions can have

5

on global health. Put simply, this category
seeks to grade universities on their global
health outreach success.

Pitt lost the most points in the Inter-
national Health Grants component in this
category because only 0.24 percent of the
University’s 2010 NIH funding came from
Fogarty International Center. Receiving
this type of grant is a strong indicator of
University commitment to global health
research, training and collaboration, ac-
cording to the UAEM website.

Despite the scores and criticisms given
by the global health report card, Burke is
conﬁdent in Pitt’s research capabilities
and is optimistic for the future. He ex-
pects Pitt to emerge as a clear—cut leader
in global health research and education
in coming years.

“Pitt is a biomedical research power-
house, but we are still learning as a uni-
versity how to project those capabilities
globally,” he said.

Collinsworth would like to add that
UAEM does recognize that many individu-
als and research groups within lower-scor-

‘ ing universities are doing groundbreaking

and high impact work that may not be
speciﬁcally highlighted or accounted for
by their methodology.

“Our intention is that the report card
be viewed as an assessment of each in-
stitution as a whole in comparison to its
peers and should be in no way be seen as
discrediting outstanding individual ef-
forts,” Collinsworth said. I

“Am I in agreement 100 percent? I
would say no,” Jabro said, but added, “If
this is something students say they want,
then I’m all for it.”

At the start of public meeting, Loud-
erback issued a personal statement ad-
dressing the article in The Pitt News last
week that identiﬁedhim and five other
members of the Board as Druids. In his
first public comment following the pub-
lication of the article, he said the story
was inaccurate, and he invited anyone

Students addressed that invitation im-
mediately when the open—ﬂoor portion of
the meeting began and members of the
general student body, ‘SGB affiliates, and
former Board members shared their opin-
ions and took the opportunity to candidly
express frustration at the current Board
regarding several issues.

Former Allocations Committee mem-
ber and former Druid Rosie McKinley
asked Louderback in front of attendees
if he was a Druid, and he said he would
talk to her after the meeting if she wished.

Louderback told The Pitt News follow-
ing the meeting that he is not a Druid and
that he didn’t read the entire story, so he
couldn’t cite specific inaccuracies. “Look,

I have ﬁnal exams to worry about, and.

this is just a distraction,” Louderback said
following the meeting, regarding why he
didn’t address the article’s content when
it was published. “Honestly, honestly, [sic]

it wasn’t worth my time.” . ,

He said that he had a meeting with th
Board following the publication of the
story regarding several members named
as Druids, but he said the meeting was
private,'so he wouldn’t comment on what
happened at the meeting.

Natalie’ Rothenberger, who ran on

Imegaslate Steel and Stone as a presiden-

tial candidate against Louderback in last
November’s election, urged the Board to
remember that it is a unit.

“You need to be an honest Board; an
approachable Board,” Rothenberger said.

Other students who voiced their opin~ S A

Hallinan, who expressed her disappoint- '

ment with the current Board from their
time campaigning through their first se-
mester in office. Tim Larkin, who ran on
the Kessler—Larkin 2012 slate during last

November’s election, echoed Hallinan’s —
' disappointment, calling attention to the

many infractions ﬁled during the cam-
paigning process.

After several committee chairs sug-
gested students take their concerns to SGB
members’ office hours, junior Rohith Palli
emphasized his belief that students do not
want to go to office hours because they
prefer the transparency of open discus-
sion at public Board meetings.

Following the meeting, Rosenthal said
that he was conﬁdent that the Board would
have a new Elections Code voted in by the
second public meeting of the fall semester.
Elections Code revisions must be approved
eight weeks prior to the election to be in
effect during the process.

Gish said his committee still believes '

that they must vote on a Code that will
create the fairest voting process, and
not “simply because a Board is telling us
to change it in a certain way. I won’t say
that I won’t change my stance on slates
in a future revision, but I am extremely
interested in speaking with the Board on

‘ the subject.”

' Gish said that his committee will work
on revisions over the summer and he plans
to propose revisions in the /first public
meeting in the fall. '

“[The Board] needs to convince me

that the changes they will support are not V

just strictly to protect the system we have
now,” he said. ’ - «

For Pitt’s undeclared majors,
consider studyingeconomics

Daniel Okwaisie '
Columnist '

The following is an infallible truth:
As an economics major, people will
ﬁnd you inﬁnitely more attractive
than other college students. This
observation is ceteris paribus,
of course — all else being equal.
Showering is still indispensable.
As another academic year
draws to a close and some of us
- prepare to graduate, there is no
doubt that we have acquired a
great deal of knowledge in college,
not only from books, but from col-
lege itself. I’m sure I’m express-
ing the opinion of a large swathvof
graduating seniors when I_say that
the challenge of ﬁnishing college
isn’t even necessarily the classes,
but how adeptly a student manages
his or her lifestyle outside of class.
Given that fact, I have come
to the conclusion that economics
is the best major to study. At the
very least, everyone needs some
knowledge in economics to have a
fulﬁlling college experience.’
First of all, economics majors

V — know that-one needn’t study nor

do any other sort of classwork at
all, because if it really has to be
done, the free market will do it.

If the need to study does‘ some-

how arise, however, economics
students have a leg up on prepa-
ration, because we know how to
study. And in college, knowing.
not just when’, but how to study
is probably the biggest asset any
student could have. Don’t tell me
you’ve never had one of those days

when you showed up to atest only V

to ﬁnd out the material you barely
even looked at was the exam’s main
focus.

. As an economics major ‘prac-
ticed inbuilding and interpreting
models, it should be easy to come
up with a probability-based model
to calculate the fewest number of
pages you can read to glean the
relevant material for any test. Such

an optimized systemwill enable’

you to ace that statistics test while
expendingas little energy and time
as possible studying e the only
minor blip in this plan possibly
being that you’ll probably have
to read the whole statistics book

before being able to structure your V

slacker-friendly model. If you have .

enough enthusiasm,‘ though, being
an economics major will motivate
you to work hard toward your goal
of effective laziness sometime in

.the future. And who knows? Read-
. ing the entire book might have a_

positive externality in terms of
your test results. .
Research has consistently
shown that the academic per-
formance of college students is
heavily affected by the romantic
relationships that they engage in
— or don’t — in college. As an

economics major, all worries in.

this-department are allayed. Be-
ing an economics student means

_ never lacking conﬁdence,‘ that

all—important self—esteem factor
necessary for one to radiate irre-
sistible charisma. This is because
economics majors know that if
they lack conﬁdence, the placebo
effect generated by pretending
they do is all that is necessary to
gain the actual virtue. Once con-

‘ ﬁdence is attained, pickup lines

aren’t hard to-come by.‘ Just walk

demanding, but trust me, I can supply it.”
The worst your romantic interest can do is
smack you with an invisible hand.

In addition to our clever charm, eco-
nomics students also have the skillset to
avoidiieartbreak during our collegecareers.
We know togavoid common pitfalls such as

Seeing as gifts don’t make loved ones de-

might seem cruel andlselﬁsh at ﬁrst, but as liable now orany time in the future for any
economics students, we know that all eco- ' heartbreak or trauma caused by an attempt

to implement this economic advice. User
discretion is advised.)
Ultimately, an economics major is a

smart choice because it imparts to students

a more complete education than any other ~.
ﬁeld. The truth is that, in college, physicists
and mathematicians write little, and English
majors calculate not much. On the spectrum
of education in the three ‘R’s, a major in
economics hammers home all three ‘R’s —
reading, writing and arithmetic — more
than any other major, and this should give
us a big advantage in the future in terms of
adaptability. Not to mention that if we ever
do ﬁnd ourselves unemployed, we can take
a little solace in the fact that, unlike others,
we actually understand why. I

CLUB SPORTE

Pitt Rugby: From the muddy Cathedral lawn tonationals ,

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

Before grass becomes a lush, green patch
of land, it’s mud or dirt. Nothing has grown
from it yet. The product must be cultivated
over time.

The patch of earth where the Panther
Rugby Football Club trains, located on the
southwest corner of the Cathedral Lawn,
embodies the squad itself, in many ways.

In a ﬁeldsituated between an‘inco‘n—
veniently placed sidewalk, a big tree and
some bushes that separate the space from
the bordering Belleﬁeld and Forbes avenues,

the men’s club rugby team at Pitt practices

three times a week during the fall and spring

months. It makes for an odd scene as the
players run through three-on-two situations
and complex—looking passing drills, darting
and weaving in all directions in short, cal-
culated movements while people meander
on, mostly unaware of the purpose of the
activity. A _ .

But neither the lack of adequate facilities

' nor new players’ lack of familiarity with the

sport has kept the team from achieving suc-
cess. It qualiﬁed for its ﬁrst national tour-
nament since 2004 by beating St.'Joseph’s
University, 35-26, last weekend.

Pitt boasts a winning streak going back
to this time last year. The team hasn’t had
a losing season in more than a decade and
has won seven ofits last 11 conference cham-

Next up for the team is its nationals match

27 against a to-be-determined opponent.
The majority of its members had never
playedthe’ sport — a pastime with English
origins that resembles American football in
its scoring system with two endzones and a
pair of uprights, but bans forward passes and
pads and keeps play continuous —‘ before
coming to college. Seven of the 15 starters
this season played rugby before they came
to Pitt. ”

“The people who become starters are
starters because they pick it up quick and
they’re already coming into college athletic,”
said senior‘ Evan Weinstein, a starter for the
team’s A-side before breaking his collarbone.
“They’ve already played sports throughout
high school, even if it wasn’t rugby.”

TASSER’S LAST TAKE

Student—atl1lete-sportswriter reminisces about his time at Pitt

Donnie Tasser
Stqff Wrz'ter

For my ﬁnal three-and-a-half years at the
University of Pittsburgh, I played a dual

role: a student—athlete and a sportswriter.

for The Pitt News. _ ‘ ‘

While it wasn’t always easy, and my ﬁve
years here were marked by a series of sport-
ing ups and downs (disappointment is a
lesson learnedthehard way for many Pitt
sports fans), I wouldn’t trade the experi-
ence for the world. «

For‘ three years, my editors saw ﬁt to
give me the chance to literally write what-
ever I wanted about the world of sports on
a weekly basis. And I am forever grateful
for that opportunity.

As a sportswriter, I witnessed Scottie
Reynolds and Villanova crush the collective
dreams of Pitt fans in one full-court sprint
in the ﬁnal seconds of an Elite Eight game
in 2009. Pitt basketball’s regular—season
brilliance and the collective dedication of
the Oakland Zoo to create an unmatched
home—court advantage still astounds me.

I saw four different head football coach-
es and the variety of disappointments each
one brought. - '

I saw the beautiful Petersen Sports Com-
plex open, ﬁnally providing the baseball,
softball and soccer teams with the amazing
facility they'deserve.  

I saw the Steelers play in two Super
Bowls and win one, prompting a ridicu-

_lous riot in Oakland. The Penguins won

a Stanley Cup that same year, -butit was
summer and there was no such debauchery
to be had. 2 -  7,"
.It'was strangetrying to play both the
sportswriter. and the athlete, having to
write about my fellow athletes objectively.

The task became especially diflicult .

when Pitt lost; I knew ﬁrsthand hovvihard
every athlete worked, and to write {nega-
tively about any team or player wasﬁnever
fun. ~ A "e

As an athlete, I saw our wrestlingfteam
evolve from a middlingprogram to the
powerhouse of the Eastern Wrestling
League. We recorded a very unimpressive
4-7-1 record during my ﬁrst yearon the

team, but we quickly improved. Over my .

four years, we went 22-1 in conference dual

meets and became a ﬁxture in the national
top-15 rankings. 4 .

Last season, we even broke into the top
10 for the ﬁrst timein 50 years.

I_ watched two of my close friends and
teammates, Matt Wilps and Zac Thomus—
seit, become All—Americans and win Pitt’s
most prestigious student—athlete awards,

_ the Panther Award and the Blue—Gold

Award, respectively.

I witnessed my younger brother, P._].
Tasser, defy all odds and qualify for the
national tournament at heavyweight last
season, despite giving up between 60 and
100 pounds to all of his opponents. _

I saw my coach, Rande Stottlemyer, win

The Pitt baseball team had already domi—.
-nated, Youngstown State thisseason, beating

the Penguins in three previous matchups by

' 'scores of 9-2, 16-1 and 24-7. '

On Tuesday afternoon, however, the Pan-
thers (2‘5—9, 6—3 Big East) barely edged out a
victory against-the,Penguins; sweeping the
‘season -series with an ‘11-9 win at Charles L.
Cost Field.‘ l ‘

Luke Curtis, a redshirt sophomore pitch-

er who has appeared for the Panthers as
both a starter and reliever this season, took
the mound for Pitt after probable starter
Alex Caravella was scratched due to food
poisoning. Starting second baseman Dylan
Wolsonovjch was also given the day off," a
move that head coachjoejordano conﬁrmed
was simply for some rest.

The Penguins took the ﬁrst lead of the
game after Pitt star junior outﬁelder Casey
Roche dropped a ﬂy ball.'It was Roche’s third
error this year. --

“I forgot my sunglasses,” Roche said of
the play. “I lost it in ‘the sun, and it actually
hit me in the head.”

But the Panthers immediately responded

back home runs by redshirt junior left ﬁelder
Steven Shelinsky and senior third baseman
Sam Parente. Pitt led 7-1 after the eventful
ﬁrst inning.

Shelinsky’s home run was his Big—East—
leading 10th of the season. However, the
slugger doesn’t care about that.

“I don’t'pay attention to- my statistics,”
Shelinsky said. “I think what’smore impor-
tant is that I’m more relaxed this year, and
it’s brought my game to the level it’snat now.”

Youngstown State tacked on one run in»

both the second and third innings to cut the
Pitt lead to 7-3 before Roche slugged a two-
run homer over. the left-ﬁeld wall to extend
the Pitt lead to 9-3.

7 The dinger marked the eighth ho m_e_run
and 47th RBI of the season for Roche, a lead-

’ ing candidate for-‘Big East Player of the Year.
“I’ve got to credit a lot of [my success] to -

the guys in front of me getting on base, as
well as guys behind me like Shelinsky and
Boo [Vazquez] hitting well,” said Roche, who
leads the Big East in RBIs. ' ' ’ .
The Panthers were forced to make due
with a shuffled lineup. ’ l ’
Sophomore catcher Elvin Soto was re-
placed by freshman Billy Lipari in the third
inning for non—injury-related reasons. '

the same caliber schools as the A-side, and
many of its members play on the A-side,
too, making the distinction between the two
teams ﬂuid. ,

An experience—laden squad has guided
the team through the transition with 13 play-
ers graduating this semester.

One of those veteran players is captain
Chris Halesey. Z, r ’ '

“We basically came in, as the underdog
and not a lot of people in conference or other
teams really expected much of us coming up
from D—II,” the senior said. “We just sur-

. prised everybody because we knew;/«hat we

were capable of.” . j A , ‘:

The fact that a team with a starting lineup
consisting of people who have the most play-
ing experience has had so much success is no
coincidence, according to junior starter Hans
Kessler, the club’s vicepresident, to whom
there’s no substitute for actual gameplay.

“You actually have to play, ﬁrst of all,

to ‘start to learn where you need to be [and '
' what to do in a game. It takes‘ about two to

three games where you don’t feel like you’re

‘ a complete idiot out there,” Kessl_er said. “It

takes some time, and then you start to realize
generally what you do.” i - ' = ’
Despite the time he has spent competing

over the past three years, Kessler admits

he doesn’t haveltotal-mastery of the:--rules‘ V
and the .garne’snuances‘  which   be
. expected witha sport such as this. 9 

“With B-side just being an opportunity for
everyone to play, that makes [those] games
extremely valuable because it allows our new
players to get some experience without hav-
ing the A-side on the line,” he said.

Halesey said the sport is hard to pick up
and truly learn just by attending._practice,
especially when you consider how the size of

the practice space doesn’t allow for a full, real ‘

scrimmage. Going full-speed forces people to

have to make the same split-second decisions

they would against an opponent.

“It’s tough to learn in practice,” he said.
“You have to actually go out and play the
games. The best way to learn is just to play it.”

To head coach Dan'Talbert, astute, ath-
letic people are assets because quick reﬂexes
are a requirement for success in the sport.

“The faster you make decisions in rugby,

_the better off you are,”» said Talbert, who’s '

been’ coaching the team since 1999 and
played at Pitt from 1991 to 1995.

This idiom especially holds true given
the increased talent level of Pitt’s opposition
this year after moving up from Division II to
I-AA, and as a member of the more talented
Keystone Conference. , ~

“The pace of the game is the main thing
that changed from D‘-II to D-I. You can tell
everything just got a little faster,” Weinstein
said. “You didn’t really have as many begin-
ner players. Everyone kind of already knew
what was going on.” . g '"

“Most of them don’t have any rugby in-
stincts. More than half of them never saw a
rugby ball before they got on campus,” he

added. “That’s  we try to do is build these

instincts, build the knowledge, and then it’s

up to them to put it together on the ﬁeld.”
Talbert, like many of the people he now
teaches, didn’t know anything about the
sport before he joined the team in the fall
of his freshman year. The false perception
that a lack of familiarity with the sport means
people should try to stick with the sport is
one of the greatest misconceptions he and

the players have to combat on a regular basis. T H

“You don’t have to know anything to come
out for the team. We will teach you, ‘and you

will learn how to play,” he said. “We lose’ '

a lot of people cause they’re like,_,‘Well, I
don’t know anything about it.’ Well, yeah,
neither did I.”. V . l_

V Many newcomers aren’t prepared for the

_ inherent struggles that come with learning

to play such a physical and demanding sport.
“A lot of people who were reallyvgood in
high school see rugby,,they try it and they’re
not really good right away, and again, that’s
the learning curve. It takes about 10 games to
be good to be able tobe like ‘OK, I’m making
all the right decisions.”’ A ’ ' , 1 __ :_  If -
‘- Matt Dunleavy, the sole freshman starter

for the A-side, began playing in eighth ‘grade

and continued through high school with
a rugby club alongside current teammate
juniorjimmy “Sprinkles” Lennox, the team’s
kicker. - V ' '

That p°rior experience has given him an
advantage over his peers andhelped him
secure ‘a starting spot this semester, his ﬁrst
withgthe team. 2 ‘ ’  *9

. “It helps aten. v_vouldn’_tl):e_ in the po_si- I

tion thatl am right now if it wasn’t for that,”
Dunleavy said. “Just coming in with that
experience when a lot of players are brand

new to it just gives you a head start and helps i

you pick up the game a lot easier.” .
It took him ab out two years after startin
to play to get to the point where the mental
part of the‘ game became less of a burden
and more of a strength. ' '
“You start to get toiwhere you don’t have
to think about it and it just kind of comes to
you,” he said. “It’s all ingrained in your mind,
basically, and just becomes a reaction.”
Weinstein doesn’t' think his schooling in
the sport is close to over. . i

‘‘I’m deﬁnitely still learning, every game '

I play,” he said. »

The high numberlof players on the ﬁeld -
. makes knowledge of the game imperative

for group chemistry purposes. - .
“Youhave the 15 positions, and each posi-
tion has its own role. But in order to-ﬁgure
what really that role is, you kind of have to
know where you ﬁt in among all the other

' positions,”_-Weinstein said. “You can be really

good at your position, but if you don’t have at

least a basic understanding of what the other - -
positions do, then you’re not really going to ‘

be very helpful as a team player in rugby.”
Twice more this week-and a few more

Pitr inni k u fies aferi use a seve-run ﬁrs_tin,in

to defeat the l’.enguins,11-9. Andy Slepman | Staff Photographer »

Curtis was pulled after. four innings of '

six—hit ball, striking out six, walking none

and allowing three runs, with only two of g

them being earned.

The Panthers then ran into some trouble
in the top of the sixth inning.

Two errors by senior shortstop Evan
"Oswald led to four unearned runs for
Youngstown State, who remarkably scored

' , those four runs on just one hit.
Freshman reliever‘ Andrew Belfiglio ~

danced his way out of further damage,
getting Penguins shortstop Phil Lipari -
brother of Pitt’s Billy — to ground out with
the bases loaded.

The Panthers responded with two runs in
the bottom of the sixth inning thanks to an
RBI single by designated hitter Boo,Vazquez,
who went 3-for-5 with two RBIs in the game.

After surrendering two walks to start the
inning, Belﬁglio was replaced by redshirt
sophomore Joe Harvey, who managed to_
surrender only one run (aninherited runner

from Belﬁglio) while again stranding the
Penguins with the bases loaded.

After both teams put up zeroes in the
eighth inning, Youngstown State tacked on
a run via a sacriﬁce ﬂy by catcher Dan Popio
in the ﬁnal inning. The Penguins managed to
load the bases, but Harvey struck out Lipari,
notching his third save and the Panthers’
25th-win of the season. '

It would be easy to attribute this lack—
luster performance against a 10-26 oppo-
nent — albeit a win — to overlooking this
matchup. B'ut Roche sees it differently.

, T‘Ydungstown State is a well—coached «

team,” he said after the game. “They’re not
just going to give in.”

Jordano echoed his star player’s.senti-
ment, simply explaining, “That’s baseball.”

The No. 25»Pi_tt Panthers won’t have much
time for rest: The team hosts a doubleheader
against Coppin State tomorrow. First pitch
for game one is scheduled for 1 p.r_n. at Cost
Field in the Petersen Sports Complex.
