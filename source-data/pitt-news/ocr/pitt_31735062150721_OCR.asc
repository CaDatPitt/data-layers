Letter To The Editor

This is a ﬁnal word to the new staff and the old. The school
year is_ passing and many things have been done which may do‘
no good, but such things I can never regret, nor wish undone.
a few parting remarks and the 1936-37 case will '

It still takes four years to learn that "there is so much.th'a"t‘ is

actually known. A college still

mcrcly opens up the way and offers a start in the right‘dir‘ection.

Then next, a message for Miss Amos, Dr. Lanfear, Ted Biddle,
and the others who have reacted‘ to what The News has had: to
say in the past few months: That the three first mentioned have
constantly given the best o-f their time, effort, and energy to the
University. They serve untiringly, accept rebuffs cheerfully and
with extreme tolerance and good nature, and are deeply inter.-
cstcd in developing students socially. They take slander, dis-

praise with equal graciousness.

The Cathedral of Learning. will do for the University what
no other person or thing has been able to do thus far. Education
will come to the front to assume its proper. position. Students
will clamour at the doors for“ admission; Footballs will be de-
ﬂared, and Pitt will still have national champions and Jock“

And ﬁnally to The 1936-37 News staff. it’s been a great year‘
of excitement, fun, and action. Any good that Inns l)~CCl‘l7d0I1€, has
been done by you. When again next year people derisively chant,
“Well what has The News done for the World today,” tell ’em
to stop their heckling and tend‘ to their own knitting.

Thanks and Good lnick,

Diploma Parchment Made
From Australian

Sheep

June 9th Sheepskins
Will Have Hand

Lettered Names

By L-EOPOLD KOI5.BERI.E.lN

On graduation day, June 9,
1100 spotless diplomas, taken

from the hides of sheep that

once grazed in Australia, will
be‘ rolled lnto a. scroll ‘form,-
tied‘ with the trad1't1o1‘1al Uiilversity
blue and gold, anddispensed on a
program that will obscure the story

I ~ that goes into their _making.

This story,.a_s told by C. VW. Nor-
der, engrosser, has a romantic appeal-
perhaps as strong as the rom_ance‘of
printing. And, he ‘adds, the (liploma
given here at ‘the U11ivers'ity' is one
with a particular story and appeal.

The Unive1‘sity’s di‘pl_o1na,v as do
all diplomas, hasthe heritage of Old

‘Oxford, says Mr. Nordcr, andin ad-'

dition they are done ina lettering

'o1'iginated ' by the * versatile Leonardo ‘
de Vinci four centuries ago on sheep‘

skins that come from Australia via
England.
hand letteredin ‘the same face as the
rest of the diploma.

“Until 15 years ago,” says Mr.
Norder, “Pitt diplomas were much
like those of other universities-
Gothic text lette1'ing.do.ne on sheep-
skin. It was then,” he. continued,‘
“that Chancellor John G. Bowman de-
cided upon a change. He wished ‘to
retain the sheepskin but to change
the Gothic text to a classical Roman
face.”

Mr. Norder was asked to take over
the job." He borrowed an Italian
book, “Divina l’roporcionc”’~ by a 16th
century Italian,‘ Pa'ccio.li, from the Art
Institute ‘of Chicago, one of the two
copies in the United -States. ‘In this
book, dc Vinci’s alphabet was first
used. ' '

One of’ the‘ main features of the let- -

ters is -their(lesigne1'_’s method which
permits them to ‘be rep’1'oduc‘ed With
;.>,'eome‘t1*ic. p1'e«.‘ision. ’

In describing Leonardo's alphabet,
Mr. Norder compares it to a type
known as Goudy, a face slightly simi-
lar to the headline type on this page.
It differs, he says, in the delicacy and
fineness of its lines which makes it
impractical for the harsh treatment
which types receive on the modern
press.

Because of ‘this impracticability, a
plate must be engraved, after being
etched by hand, for each degree given
by the University—totaling at least
60 variations a year. Each plate,
being dated, must then be destroyed
after the required number of “blank”
diplomas have been lithographed.
Then comes the real work:

The name of every student to re-
ceive a degree is embossed by hand
on the “blanks.” The work on the
diplomas to be awarded next month
was started during Christmas week,
1936, when the University registrar’s

oflice released a partial list of poten-

tial graduates. Mr. Norder and one

Honor Roll Significance

ODAY, THE REGISTRAR’S office releases

the first honor roll since the fall semester rat-
ings of 1935-36 were announced just one year ago
this spring. Under normal conditions the honor
roll is compiled upon the completion of each
semcster’s work. Last spring session (1936) rat-
ings, however, were not compiled due to a change
in the system at that time.

The fall semester 1936-37 list appears today
and perhaps it will mean something to a large
majority of students, either as a result of the
inclusion or exclusion of the respective name.
For those who “made” any of "the three honor
scholastic lists, the recognition will perhaps re-
ward them for past work well-done and drive on
the student so honored to even higher attain-
ments. To those who fail to make the grade, per-
haps the results, though negative in significance,

will likewise do good. Determination and appli-
cation may replace some of the latent qualities.

that too often characterize the work of students".

Grades, average or high ones, are necessary to
an extent. Few students are capable of learning
withoutshowing some of their learning on a re-
port card or blue-print. Though the system is not
perfect, students must accept the present system
and work according to its rules until a better
one comes along.

A blue-print can’t possibly show’ everything,
but it does show enough characteristics and ten-
dencies of the person whose name appears on
its face to prove of some worth. As soon as the
effects of graduation and the transition period of
settling into the reins of a life of employment
wear off, the grades mean little or nothing, ex-
cept possibly to bring back memories to the senti-
mentalist. A blue-print serves further, we admit,
as a record of recommendation for the graduate
when he seeks employment. The honor roll
merely reflects by semester what the blue-print
will show compositcly over a four-year span.

Some students will earn honor ratings by vir-
tue of “picking” the soft spots that frequent the
curriculum in most of our colleges and universi-
ties. Others climb to the top the hard way, by
selecting courses of study that beneﬁt and con-
tribute most to a particular line of work and to
a well-rounded background for the years ahead.
There are various motives and reasons for scor-
ing high scholastically, and the ones most worth-
while are the ones that arccharacterized by a

’   of the effort, and

rhe1s.gssw.

.has_.b.een observed that students just don't care

the will to use that knowledge to its best
advantage. ‘

Honor ratings do not necessarily predict suc-
cess and advancement for the future, but they
are a good indication of what to expect from the
man who has earned a high one.

Last Senior Ball ?

ONIGI-IT’S BALL WE ARE TOLD will be a
ﬁnale in more ways than one . . . It seems
thcre’s not enough interest to justify the ﬁnan-
cial risk and the efforts of the committee for this
last Senior social event. Over a period of years it

to attend. They arcn’t interested.

It takes no great insight to understand this at-
titude. For one thing, Senior Ball isn’t one of the
‘frnust” dances for a majority of the students.
And it occursltop late in the year--too near ﬁnal
cxarninationsglfvthc Seniors of ‘.38, ’39, ’4.0 want

to the proportion corresponding affairs have
reached at other Universities. Then there Will be
justification for its continuance.

It may be the fault of an overcrowded social
calendar. Perhaps students are socially weary
near the waning stages of the school year.

There is the possibility that the affair could be
made a compulsory event on the commencement
week program for Seniors. If this were to hap-
pen, the dance then would become a Senior Ball
for Seniors. 9.

However, if the present set-up is to be con-
tinued, the dance requires lowerclassmcn sup-
port. For scntimcntalrcasons if for no other rea-
son, the Senior Ball should be _a smashing ﬁnale
to the year's social season for all classes, and a
formal parting for the graduates.

The Senior Ball means much to many students,
and it would be regrettable if the affair were
"benched” from the social calendar until suffi-
cient interest is shown for its revival. It is to be
hoped that the Senior Ball is successful both
financially and socially tonight so that the gradu-
ating classes in the future may continue this
traditional event in the Senior program.

  Study In Comfort

(Editors Note: This is the seventh In a series of
articles dealing with the mechanics and composition
of the Cathedral Library.)

By MILTON G. LEHMAN

Thus far we have found that the reference room helps
students in research, that the reserved book room makes
it possible for students to obtain volumes containing
the required readings in connection with their classroom
work, that the lending department enables students to
borrow books, that the periodical room subscribes toand
keeps on ﬁle current magazines for the use of students,
that the Alldred roomis a place in which students may
browse among books on all subjects. .

Besides the Darlington Room, which will be reviewed
in the next number of our series, there are two rooms
in the library which have a deﬁnite purpose all of their
own. The Men's Reading Room and the Women’s reading
Room on the sixth ﬂoor, under the supervision of Mrs.
Jean Donaldson Wood, are reserved for study.

Mrs. Wood, who was graduated from the college in
1911 and was first president of YWCA on campus,
briefly outlined the function of the two rooms: “Quiet
study, generally,” she‘ said. A“Speciﬁcally, the Women’s
Reading Room has volumes of particular interest to Uni-
versity w-omen: books for the orientation course for
freshman wo-men: books on women’s occupations, books
of reference...biographies of women, and an extensive
collection given us by the alumnae of the Pittsburgh
School of De-signfor Women.”

Planned to hold some 600 volunies, the Women’s
Reading Room has been given a collection of several
hundred books by the Alumnae association, which has
been dedicated to Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women.
More volumes will be added to the collection from time
to time,

In the Men’s Reading Room fraternity ma.gazi11es are
located. Adjoining the room are two conference rooms
which may be used for various meetings with which
books are associated.

Chief feat‘ures of the two rooms are comfortable
chairs, good lighting, and, largely, provisions for "study
in comfort.”

Brain Straighteners

By Albert Lasday

An office worker whose secret passion was farming
grew industrious one Saturday and planted ten apple
trees in his orchard. As this was quite an accomplish-
ment for him, be communicated his very natural elation
to his fellow workers the following Monday by telling
them that he had planted five rows of trees, each row
containing four trees.

Now this was wrong, because it gaves the impression
that he had planted twenty trees, whereas he actually
had planted only ten. But our amateur gardener was
more resourceful than we are giving him credit for
having been. He was not ‘stretching things.’ .

The problem is to see if you can reproduce the dia-
gram by which be used ten trees to produce ﬁve rows
of four trees in a row.

"Matinee" Comes Down

When we delivered our first lines
this winter we were as clear about
our future as the drunk who kept
knocking on the lamp pole. When
asked why he kept knocking, he said
he was sure that someone was in be-
cause ‘there was a light on upstairs.
We’re a little steadier now, but we'd
like to know how you feel. Do you
want Matinee next year?

‘L-if .

As the athletic season, along with
the rest of the seasons, comes to a
close, we can't help butreminisce a
bit, in our‘ pseudo-sentimental man-
ner, over the events and athletic
milestones of 1936-37.

First high‘ spot of the year was a
great. game before a great crowd‘
at Ohio State. when Curly Stab-
bins.. behind remarkable blocking.
scampered over the Buckeye goal
with the only touchdown, he was,
in effect, -blazing the trail which
1936-37 Panther athletics woulclv
follow.

Bu’t~one week later, the unforget-
table sight of Duquesne’s George, Mat-
sik breaking through the line, evading
the secondary, and carrying all Pitt's

lost-lRose; Bowl hopes over the Pan-.

thor goal ‘line’-into oblivion became
some.thingywe’ll always think about,
though we don’t want to. -

Following that, high spots came «
thick and -fast. Notre Dame -was
swamped under an avalanche of
vicious Panthers- led -by -a world-
beating Goldberg. And then this
same» .?teain'-~-was- ‘stopped -inside -the
five-yard line for the only time this
yea:-‘when itatrtscl: the r"S‘even Pil-
lars of stori‘o3¥;_.ait.--‘Fordiham. --

Dr. Carlson - had a comparatively
weak team. It was awkward; it had,
apparently, a minimum of ability, but,
as the -season progressed, it became
obvious that the Panther courtmen
couldn’t be lickcd when it counted.
The first sign of it came when
the Pitt team overcame» a big lead ‘
to topple Notre Dame -and West-~
minster in last-minute rallies.

l

And then came the greatest cage

game the Stadium Pavilion has ever
seen. That, at least, was the opinion
of ‘the entire Pitt majority of the
4,000 or so howling maniacs who had
the fortune to see it. Losing by .15
points at halftime and hopelessly out-
classed by- a Duke team which played-
in a cool, professional manner, the
sipped a little ‘more ice
cream .-than». usual, and "stepped. out

to cut down that lead: to nothing as
the gun sounded. The extra period,

which ended as the gun again sounded
and Joe Garcia's push shot from l‘nl(l-
ﬂoor dropped through for the win-
ning count, made history,

That Pitt went on to win the-city
and Eastern Conference champion-
ships was almost an anti-climax.

And as for track, one week never

outstrips another in thrills only be-

cause Johnny Woodruﬁ‘ and Ken Ry-
den keep up their pace ‘continuously
with hardly a variation.
It's been a great~year- for the -
Panthers in sports. Not since 192-7-
28, nine years ago, has Pitt rated

so high or- gone -so‘ far in national 6

competition. But, from all appear-

cornparatively easy style, 7-2.

Captain, manager,‘ and number one-

man Joe Kristufek, led: his teammates

Having the ci'ty championship as

the only laurel. of their year, the
Panther putters will attempt to ex-
tend their might into a wider terri-
tory tomorrow afternoon when they
match tee shots with Waynesburg
down at the Yellow Jackets’ home
course.
_ Waynesburg and Pitt represent the
strongest fairway outﬁts in ‘this dis-
trict and the match tomorrow will do-
cide the mythical title.

Last Saturday, during the Tartan
Spring Festival ceremonies, Waynes-
burg did a little celebrating of their
own. They smothered the Tartans,
7-0, a better score than Pitt register-
ed against Carnegie.

Goldberg, Waynesburg number one V

man, is one of the best golfers in the
section. He shot a 74 over the Pitts-
burgh Field Club course last week.

Diploma

assistant are now completing the last
of the 1,100.

Among the processes that a com-
plete diploma must go through is that
of humidiﬁcation which makes the
skins pliant enough to be printed.
For a week or more they are kept in
the humidiﬁer and then they are
pumiced.

Mr. Norder tells of a hot, dry spell
one summer when it took two days
to get the ﬁrst skin into the press.

After the diplomas leave Mr. Nor-
de-r’s oﬂice downtown, they are
brought to the University where they
are sent to the transfer, the Secre-
tary of the University, the chairman

of the Board of Trustees and the

dean of the school from which the
student receives his degree. Here they
receive the original signatures of the
person’s name.-

In addition to its use on diplomas
Leon-ardo’s lettering "found a wider
vogue in the University this year
when it was used for an inscription
on the outside-of the Darlington Room
of the library.

Easy Over  Virginian S  1

Meet Tomorrow
  Ends Pitt‘Dual,

Track Season

Why did Pitt come very. close to
scoring 100 points in walloping West
Virginia tomorrow?

This isn't even a brain “straightener.
Carl Olson’s smooth-stepping track
and ﬁeld squad will do just that when
it completes its dual set-up tomorrow
afternoon at the Stadium.

Four out of four has been The
Pitt News prediction record in the
Panther-meets thus far. Three out of
four‘ have been the Pitt track .tri'-"

umphs during therecent campaign-’

Tomorrow‘-s victory will finish the‘-
dual phase of one of Pitt's greatest
track seasons. 4
Runningwalong with the varsity
meet will be a Pitt-West. Virginia
freshman dual.’ Tlfe spirited ‘Panther

yearlings, with an undefeated team,“

are likewise favored towin.
Virginians 5Ba"t-— .750‘
W‘est._Virginia has the _same kind
of a record asthe Panthers, so far

as»victories'and defeats are concerned, -1

having won three and lost one, but-—
with regard‘ to individual perform-
ances, the Mounit.ain-eers look like the
Foster ‘Memorial when compared to
Cathedral —reprcsenta‘tives.

Serious 4 competition‘, is expected

from only a handful of mountain men. :

Hogue -will give Mason something--to
runabout in the 100-yarddash, ‘being
a" consistent ten second man. His
teammate, Isaac, skips‘ right-along
with “him at about the ‘same pace,
which is only advice to Glen Cooper,
that he ‘will have a rather‘ diﬁicult
time capturing any kind of a point in
this event.

Isaac will be out :'to do his .-real-

scoring,.-however. in the broad jump“.
His distances this season "have been
about the same as thoseof .E'd.Ro‘utc:h.'
This event~of‘t‘ers the; biggest-shit of
competition of the afternoon. If
Routch can leap -up in the territory

that goes past 23 feet, he’ll ,win'and=*

he will also be getting a little -more

Child”

lcludes: -Bea. Abbiss, C; Charlotte At» .

How an urban -community ineets
the problem of giving its children_ad-
equate and safe recreation. is ‘told by
Dr. W. A. Lunden, -assistant profes-
sor of sociology, in afrecent issue of
the Federator, publication of. the Fed-
eration’ of =S_o_cial. Agencies of Pitts-
burgh and Allegheny County; 

Writing about Homesteadfs;l.,Cal-
hounv Day Camp, Dr. Lundenj relates
how more than 1000 young’ children
from Homestead, Munhall, ’West
Homestead, Whitaker, and _Miﬁ1in
Township made use of the.-ca-mp's
facilities last summer. - 

The camp's program lasted from
10:30 to 4 o’c.ock daily,"and included
hiking, cooking, story telling, nature
study, handicraft,_.dramatics, musﬁicl.
and water sports. Lunches were‘ given
at a cost of five cents each. 3 j '

Lunden Pleads for Camp 

About 200 children attende_d_each
camping period for ﬁve days;' The
campers were divided i.rit_.c_i..sr<2i.1.I2.$I:-2?
20, eachlgroup having a"councillo'r?~ 

The good work of the Calhoun
Camp was _'esp_ecial~ly interesting. to
Dr. Lunden, becausejof ‘the difficult
problem~-presented by the congested»
and poverty-stricken Homestead dis-
trict. Juvenile delinquency and social
maladjustment ﬂourish here. due to
the lack of recreational facilities to
keep the children .01? the streets and
out of troub_1e,¢-‘he,-‘ﬁnds.

He said :- "The.-,-Calhoun Day Cainp:
should command the 'attentidn‘of all:
community workers. It gives the ‘un-
derprivileged childia :better chance.
for recreation, andknormal social, .de--
velopment. This venture should serve"
as a pa'ttern for other day camps.”

Calhoun Camp is directed by Wil-
liam Leitch, a Boy Scout leader. Fi-
nancial aid is given by the Communi-
ty Fund, the Red. Cross, the Rotary
and Kiwanis clubs, the West Home-
stead Police Department, and a bak-
ing company.
