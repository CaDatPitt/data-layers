Pitt students begin registration despite long wait

By Jennifer Sikora
For T be Pitt News

At 2:30 Monday morning, the
line began forming outside. As
the hours passed, more and
more Pitt students gathered to
wait for .the doors toopen.

It was not a line for concert
tickets, nor a line for the
release of the new R.'E.M.
album. It was a line, extending
past the seventh floor of
Thackeray Hall, to begin regis-
tration for spring classes.

On Thursday, 1,498 students
registered at Thackeray, which
was the first day of registration
for seniors. The first seniors
arrived around. 4 a.m., and
once the doors opened, new
arrivals waited over an hour
and a half.

“I got there at 4:20 a.m., sat
in the freezing cold, just so
that I get my required classes
so I-could graduate,” said Pitt
senior Melanie Golletti, a com-
munications major.

Students used many adjec-

tives to describe this process:
“painful,” “ridiculous” and “irri-
tating.”

“I give the staff a lot of cred-
it. It’s a lot of grief,” University
Registrar Samuel Conte said.

Conte said the staff tries to
get as many people as possi-
ble working with registration
because “you can’t always pre-
dict how many students you’re
going to get.” V

Although the current regis-
tration system was created just
three years ago, investigations
into a possible telephone reg-
istration are starting.

Conte said that a committee
at Pitt is reviewing the phone-
in registration systems at other
universities. He said less than
half of the top 58 research
institutions’ in the Association
of American Universities have
phone-in registration.

“Even if you go to a tele-
phone registration system, you
still have to have a way to
space out the people who are
calling,” Conte said. “If you

have 30,000 people calling at
once, the phone system isn’t
going to work any better than
standing in line.” _

The committee is surveying
how and why other universi-
ties began phone—in registra-
tion. Kent State just began tele-
phone pre-registration.

An editorial in The Daily
Kent State)‘ said, “This system
is a luxury compared to stand-
ing in long lines at the begin-
ning of a semester.” After stu-
dents at Kent State pre—register
by phone, they must attend a
basic registration in person.

Although Conte said he
receives few complaints from
students about long lines, he
hears some students raise
questions about phone—in reg-
istration.

- Assistant Registrar Dave
Carmen said such a system
would be advantageous to Pitt
because it’s a large commuter
school. “I’m sure that in the
future we’ll go to something
like that  then you could just

“They only expect us to make
$100, but this year we’ll shatter

can double that, it makes us

people were donating what
they could.

dial from your dorm room.”
Until then, Carmen said, most
students expect to wait in line.

Conte said he is pleased
with the current registration
system. He said the process
slows down when classes
begin closing, and it takes
three or four minutes finding
alternate courses.

However, many students are
not pleased. Carol Whaley, a
junior majoring in English writ-
ing, had to get out of line
Monday because ‘she could not
miss an upper-level class.
When she returned, both
options for a sequence psy-
chology course were closed.

“Here I am a junior waiting
in line behind freshmen,”
Whaley said. “No wonder I
can’t ‘get the classes and
requirements I need. 7 can see
why it takes.five years to grad-
uate.”

Also waiting in line on
Monday was first-year student
Jean-Michele Gonzalez.
Gonzalez said she “luckily” got

all her classes. “I even got a
psychology class, which I hear

they fill up very fast,” she said. 0

Fred Koloc, director of
advising for the College of Arts
and Sciences, said he does not
think first-year students and
juniors are in competition with
each other for classes. “It’s
true that some juniors may not
get a course if they register at
the end of the first week,”
Koloc said. “There have been
some freshmen and sopho-
mores registering, too.”

Koloc said any competition
for classes is one of the rea-
sons seniors now receive two
days for their own registration.
“As long as seniors have a
chance to get first crack at any
remaining requirements, I
don’t have a problem with the
fact that freshmen through
juniors register together.

“Students who come to the
meetings and follow the sys-
tem are the ones who get the
appointments first,” he said.

the 1970s into law, business»

and engineering industries

‘where the pay and mobility

was better.

“Today the job situation
looks brighter becauseiof cur-
rent retirement in the profes-
sion, and the baby boom
in 1990 led to the growth
in the community,” she
said.

Candidates who complete
the four-semester program
will earn a Master of Arts
degree in teaching and
become certified to teach in
Pennsylvania. High school
certification can be obtained
in English, foreign language,
mathematics, science or social
studies. V

The fellowship awards
annual grants up to $20,000 to
participants with a Bachelor’s

‘degree and a consent to teach

in the Pittsburgh public
schools for two years after
certification.

Recipients of the 15-month
full-time program will be
selected by a panel made up
of staff from the Pittsburgh
School District_ and Pitt’s
School of-Education. During
that time span, Pitt fellows
will teach in the Pittsburgh

public schools and do formal .
classwork. '

“This is a'real intense pro-
gram. It’s an opportunity for
African Americans who had a
dream to teach but didn’t have

‘”"the finances to bring it into

reality,” Thomas said.
Recipients will also partici-
pate in the School -District-
University Collaborative Intern
program that stresses the

development of sensitivity in a ‘

multicultural setting.
“[The internship] is a direct
application of what they are

learning to the classroom situ— A ‘

ation wher_e they are teach-
ing,” she said.

Each year up to five individ-
uals are accepted into the pro-
gram. Felix Lewis, a second-
semester student who teaches
at Westinghouse High School,
said his experiences with the
program and the internship
have been positive.

“Its an excellent program

because it’s an opportunity to.

get more African Americans
into, the school system,” he

“The Faculty Assembly is
deeply distressed that the
chancellor referred its action

Ivy Kleinbart is one of the
students who missed the
advising meeting, resulting in
a‘ late registration date.
Kl’einbart, a sophomore,
argued with a receptionist at
the advising office in

Thackeray on Monday, saying.

she just wanted to get a signa-
ture on the schedule she had
already made up.

She was told to make an
appointment with her advisor
to get the signature. There
were no openings with
Kleinbart’s advisor before her
already—scheduled Nov. 20
appointment.

I “I know exactly what classes
I want to take  and all I need
is a signature which takes a
total of point-five seconds,”
Kleinbart said after leaving the
advising office. “My advisor

quit when I was a freshman,
and nobody sent me any infor-
mation that he quit. Nobody
sent me any information that I
had a group session this year.”
Kleinbart says she thought
sophomores did not need a
signature anymore, since they
know how to register. “I never
even saw my advisor  I don't
think that somebody has to
approve my classes when they
don’t know a thing about me.”
She also said there should
be enough advisors so all stu-
dents can register before
December. “I think that a
month wait is ridiculous.”
Koloc stressed that advisors
have a sense that students
should be seen first. He said
they “would bend over back-
wards” to help a student trying
to fill requirements. He added
that each advisor is in charge

“By just giving a signature,
that person would just jump

he hears many complaints
from students who say they
never hear about advising
meetings.

“We have them the same
week every year  we do mail
out letters. Anybody who’s
been around for a while
should know that these meet-
ings take place,” he said.

Koloc said advisors are very
sympathetic to students who
register late. “It’s not so much
the system. It’s the finite num-
ber of spaces available in
classes. I realize that causes
the problem of students all
wanting to be the first in line,”
he said. L «

semester to see which classes
filled quickly, according to
OSU’s newspaper The Lantern.
K “When first-round data came
in, welooked at what was fill-
ing and made commitments of
extra sections to those class-
es,” OSU’s Associate Provost
Robert L. A-rnold told the
paper. “Those classes contin-
ued to be monitored and new
classes added until we ran out

The result was 81 percent of
OSU students receiving all
requested courses for the
autumn quarter, reversing a
four-year downward trend at
the university.

Thank you President George Bush. The time has come
for you to bid us adieu, but we will never forget what you
meant to us. All the talk about the economy, about how
you didn’t give a hoot about America, about how you
were an inept leader; we know it isn’t completely true.

The only thing that you continuously did wrong was
stutter in your speeches. We laughed at you for that.
Through it all though, your babbling proved that, just like
the rest of us, you’re human. Mortals, like yourself and
Lyndon Johnson,’ don’t get re-elected. Only history tells us
how good or bad you were. Larger-than-life supermen,
like Ronald Reagan, F.D.R. and Teddy Roosevelt, are the
only ones who get re-elected. .

But the job of president is a tough one, hardly some-

 thing that a mere mortal is capable of handling. You did
 an adequate job. Some of the criticisms pinned on you
- - weren’t fair. As a leader, the United States would be hard

pressed to find someone who loves his country so much.
You waited‘long and hard to ﬂy in WWII. You even tried
to get permission to fight for your country before you

_ were of age. For your country, you were shot down.

. President Bush, you served as ambassador to China,

I were head of the CIA, a member of Congress and vice
president. But as president, there were times when you

were incapable and wishy-washy and other times when
you were very good.

Take, for example, the Gulf War. While Saddam Hussein
continues to be a thorn in our side,~the goals set out dur-
ing Operation Desert Storm were accomplished — the lib-
eration of Kuwait and continued access to oil. Secondly,

. your handling of the economy has been beaten with a

stick, and in reality, is not something to greatly criticize.
Inﬂation and interest rates are low, and these are the two

. things which could very well lead us to long—terrri growth,

providing Clintor‘ doesn’t go too crazy with  ﬁscal pro-

grams. ‘
George Bush, you were an  president that lost us

when you tried to play politics. You wished-washed on

the issue of abortion, your appointments to the Supreme .

Court could severely limit the rights of many Americans,
and history will tell us the real story of “Iraqgate.” Finally,
the way you handled the right wing factions of your party
could be the very thing which throws the Republican
Party into a frenzy. . l .
Your last hurrah will be when you pass the torch to
President-elect Clinton on Jan. 20. Your destiny is over —
fate has been decided. All that is ‘left now is for history to
record your actions. Bill Clinton, on the -other hand, is
now the one left to write the book. Let’s hope he writes a
great classic epic. ~ I
Up there on the podium George, all bleary—eyed, you
looked both happy and sad to see your term come to and
end. The ironic thing, Mr. President, is that some of us
shared those exact same feelings. ‘

This past Friday, I‘ had an
experience while visiting a friend
in Oakland —- Dawson and
Sernple streets, to be exact.

While I rang the doorbell at my

friend’s humble abode, a group
of young toughs could be heard
shouting obscenities from across
the street. I assumed this was
simply a ribald exchange of vul-

garity which high—school boys,’

as we know, are prone to enjoy.
But soon their malicious intents
were revealed as they clarified

the direction of their rude com-

ments. I was to become the cat’s
mouse this afternoon. _

One of these delinquents "pro-
found himself a sizable chunk of
concrete and headed across the
street in my direction. His hench-

men, boys of about 14 or 16, fol—'

lowedbehind. Assessing the situ-
ation, I made it perfectly clear
that they were barking up the
wrong tree; I had‘ no money, and
seeing as how none of them
were likely to be 18, my retalia-
tion. could land me in jail. This
didbnot deter my attackers.
After about a 20-minute stand-
off, a disturbing event occurred.
The apparent leader, the fellow
with the concrete, dropped his
-makeshift weapon and reached
into his jacket, gangster-style,
shouting, “I got a gun, man. I’ll
blow you away.” This kid was
probably 14 years old.
Apparently my hostility had
upset him considerably.
vg, Needless to say, if he had used
his gun, I wouldn’t be writing
this. I_ doubt that he had a gun,
but who’s to say? The entire inci-
dent ended unevent-fully, but
after careful consideration, I have.
 arfew conclusions. I

Let’s assume, hypothetically,
that that kid really had a gun.
This situation is not as absurd as
you may think. Obtaining hand-
guns illegally in this country is
no difficult task. There are mil-

lions upon millions of unregis-

tered guns ﬂoating around this
country today, and most can be
had on the streets for a song.
Now let’s assume that I didn’t
have a gun (which I didn’t, of
course, being only 20). I h_aVe

guy. So why, in this land of the
free and home of the brave, am I
standing here at the mercy of a
pistol-packing, pre-pubescent
brat? Because my government
says that even though every jack-
ass who wants a gun can get
one through shady dealings, I
am not allowed to own one. Is
this right?

Had I been carrying a gun,

that incident would have been a_

two—second ordeal instead of a
-20-minute showdown. The solu-
tion would have been as simple
as this: The moment that I saw
these three kids coming at me,_
concrete in hand and who
knows what in their pockets,'.I
would have established their
intentions. (“Do you intend to hit
me with that_?”) Then if this was
their intention, I would simply
‘reach into my belt, pull out my
‘S&W, point it in their general
direction and ._tell them, “I think
you were on the other side of
the street. Wouldn’t you like to
stay there?” End of discussion.

- gun, why should he get rid of

this moneymaking tool (and
that’s how they see it) for any

ing in your-CD the day before it

It doesn’t matter how old you
are or how stupid. If you have a
gun, you have become a deadly

Sports Assistant

Call him the miracle maker — the leader of
Pittsburgh’s chosen team.

Mark him the worst-to-first field general.

He prefers to be called Coach Luxbacher.

As head coach of the Big East tournament-

boun_d Pitt soccer team, Luxbacher has been‘.

the steadying sideline force for the second-
place Panthers — leading them to the best
record in school history, 12-5-1. Much of the
team’s one-year turnaround in league play (0-
6—2 in 1991) has hinged on his ability to
blend unproven rookies wi.th a solid cast of
veteran players.

The result? The previously unthinkable g———' a -

berth in the conference final four.

For Luxbacher, a 1974 Pitt graduate, the
_key to his team’s turnaround success has
been the ability to avoid mistakes and take
advantage of opponent’s miscues.

“The biggest thing by far has been consis-
tency,” Luxbacher said. “It’s not like we’ve
had 12 blowout wins this year — we didn’t.
But we found ways to win.”

“Even in the games we lost, we played
pretty well.” ’

Case in point: Of Pitt’s five losses, four
were decided by one goal.

While the ninth-year Panthers’ coach

admits that the ‘9.2 team is his best team ever -

at Pitt, he said he does not think his coach-

ing style has changed all that much from last

‘ers 
-could be.”

year.
“I don’t think I’m any smarter this year than
I was last-year,” Luxbacher said. “It’s just that
we’re getting by in the close games. Our
team is well organized and plays as alteam.”
“I think I’ve made a concerted "effort  to
be a better teacher this year, in terms of
going over all the minute things that-some—g
times I take for granted. Basics things like
certain individual tactics — things I teach in
my camps all summer to younger kids.”
Known for his disciplined, strict manner of
coaching, Luxbacher does. admit to pulling
back on the intensity. a bit. He attributes that
drive to succeed to his days of professional

A soccer — five years of NASL and MISL expe-I

rience.

“Although the players wouldn’t say so, I
think I’m probably somewhat more patient
than I was earlier on,” Luxbacher said. “I’m

still very demanding, upon myself as well as ’

the players. But these guys are still 18-19

Luxbacher ‘said of the week-
end tournament. “Our goal is
higher than that. The overall
record is important; our
regional ranking is important.
We just want to be known as
a very good team.

“Part of that is doing
well in the Big East,'but
that’s not our only objective.
We want to play as well as
were capable of playing.”

While Luxbacher has got
his team to play_up to its
capabilities for most_ of this
season, he does not expect
the ‘92 surge to be a one-
year mirage. As with most

I coaches, he is set on building
a solid tradition of success —
both onand off the field.

“When these guys leave
after four years, they want to
have a good feeling that they
had a good time and were a
top team,” Luxbacher said.

The Pacific — Only the
Strong Shall Survive

The Portland Trail Blazers,
-twice_in the last three seasons
smashed in the Finals, are a
question mark to many. It’s

either a fiercer-than-ever ‘rush’

for a ring or else time to fall
off and break this club up.

Gone is Danny Ainge, one of ‘
the steadier keels on a some- j

times rocky boat. Blazer brass
made every effort to polish
this exciting team for yet one
more run, adding Rod
Strickland, Mario Elie and
rookies Tracy Murray and
David Johnson. But ‘it remains
to be seen how under—the-
gun Coach Rick Adelman will

run these thoroughbreds.

For the Blazers, this race‘

will be sheer hell. Will their
fragile psyches hold up?
Three other teams in this
crazy division hold legitimate
title hopes, starting with the
Phoenix -— the Land of the

. Rising Suns. They are now

Charles Barkley’s squad, and
by the time Sir Charles gets
out of Arizona he’ll be wear-
ing a championship ring. He’s
rough and ready to heat up
the desert nights in the
spanking new America West
Arena, surrounded by all-stars
in floor general Kevin
Johnson and the selﬂess Dan’
Majerle. Few teams can score
with this bunch, bolstered by
the signing of the irascible
Ainge. Paul Westphal must
get his bunch to play “D”
‘during crunch time. '

The other two clubs with
title aspirations are Golden

‘deep

State and ‘Seattle. "Don

Nelson’s Warriors will relive a
familiar tale — tremendous
during the regular season,
but nothing doing in the
playoffs.

The Sonics are arguably the
. fastest rising team anywhere,

led by the amazing Kemp. He

has added touches‘ to his‘

game each year and appears
capable of leading Seattle
into the playoffs.
Flanked by Derrick McKey
and Benoit Benjamin, Kemp
has loads of help up front.
The backcourt is as deep as
they come, but also as erratic

EAST — The postseason;

will again be filled with scin-

tillating series. But we have _

widely disparagingviews on
what will transpire. Pugs sees
the Eastern Conference cut
and dried with the Bulls,
Cavs, Knicks and Nets reach-
ing the semis. With all due
respect to Price and his mag-
nificent game, Ewing and the
Knicks will prevail
tremendous semi—final series
to meet up with J “the
Gambler” Jordan and trash
Chicago in the Eastern Finals.

As for Bri"s thoughts, the

Knicks and Cavs will meet —'

only in
Conference

the Eastern
finals. “The

Gambler” will get his summer -‘ ‘

airline ticket to
punched by the Knicks .in
round two. The Cavs -- who
will run over the Celts in the

second round — will then_

beat the Knicks to go to the
finals.

WEST— Pugs: Out west,
Barkley and the Mailman will

duel in a fist-pumping series?

for the ages with Phoenix
prevailing. Seattle will upset
Rip City’s. Blazers in the other
semi—final.

Bri: The Suns. are too clut-

tered to get past the second

round, falling by the wayside
like the Pacific Trailblazers.
In the final, the Jazz will
sneak by the Slammin’ Sonics
to meet the Cavs. ‘ '.

NBA FINAL —— Pugs: Once
he reaches the conference
finals, Sir Charles will turn it

all is said and done, Barkley
will hoist an MVP trophy and
wear a much-deserved NBA

looks to be a doozyi -

Stockton against ' Price-

overcoming the “Bulls syn-

New York’s Knitting Factory might look -

like just another New York
club, but the artists that have
played there have given the S
place a "reputation that spans
the world. W'hether it’s indie
rock, art rock, performance
art or jazz (avant—garde or  ‘*
otherwise), the Knitting 
Factory has played host to it.
Next _ Tuesday, the
Manchester Craftsman’s
Guild on Pittsburgh’s North
Side will feature the latest
national Knitting Factory
Tour which features
Negativland, the Peter A
Brotzmann Trio, Amy Denio
and Roy Nathanson &_
Anthony Coleman. , ’
For over 12 years, San Francisco’s
Negativland has specialized in sociopoliti-
cal commentary on our society by build-
ing “songs” around sound effects and
random tape samples of everything from
Michael Jackson to religious evangelists
and twisted musical structures. The five-

. man group is notorious for manipulating

the media and pop culture,‘ completely
distorting the truth in the process.

Last year, the group got into trouble
when it released a 12-inch single entitled
“U2.” The cover featured the title written
in large letterswhile the band’s name’
appeared in small print atthe bottom.

. The single featured two interpretations, of ~
,U2’s “I Still HaVen’t{ Found What I’m

A

Freaks of the industry: Negativeland

  

/

Looking For,” which sampled the original
version, along. with outtakes of Casey
Kasem swearing up astorm while trying
to introduce the song. '

Island Records (U2’s label) wasn’t too ‘

fond of the record and won a case that

' forced Negativland an.d its record label

SST to recall‘ and destroy all existing
copies of the record. In this day when
sampling is used by so many pop artists
who can’t come up with an original idea,
Island blew the issue out of proportion.
And in the end, it just gave Negativland
more attention. Such is the groups raison
d’etre.

Amy Denio, on the other hand, plays a
unique brand of pop music with roots in

art rock, funk and a smidgen of jazz.

Based in Seattle, she has released a num-
ber. of solo cassettes and was a member
of the Tone Dogs with Fred Chalenor.

and Matt Cameron, better known for his
work in Soundgarden.
Now that the Tone Dogs have disband-
ed, Denio released Bmbing Chair Blues
on Knitting Factory Works.
‘She played all the instru-
— ments on the disc, which
, included bass, slide guitar,
saxophone and “the dreaded
drum machine.” Recorded at
‘her home in “the fou1'—by—

bed and the wall,” tracks
range from funky songs with
‘obtuse political overtones
(“When George Bush Was
Head of the CIA”) to juxta-
positions of angelic voices
with the sound of a dish-
washer being loaded‘
(“Dishwasher”). ‘
Peter Brotzman has
been a leading_ force
(emphasis on force) in the ‘free-jazz
movement in New York as well as his
home in Germany. His saxophone style"
picks up where players like Albert Ayler
left off, steeped in loud, intense walls of

sound. Some might call it noise, but that

would be a great injustice.

At home, Brotzmann worked on the
cooperative FMP‘ record label and played
with avant—gardists like Derek Bailey and
Cecil Taylor. ’

In New York, he has played with Iast
Exit, a band that practically defines the
tenn “Downtown New York Jazz,” based
around the Knitting Factory. Brotzmann,

Internal strife of Romanian revoltlost in Pitt's Mold Forest

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

The struggles of the
Romanian people leading up to

- the revolution of 1989 were

frustrating. Unfortunately, Pitt
Theatre’s production of Mad
Forest, a play chronicling the
revolution, is just as time-con-
suming and frustrating.

The play, named for an
impenetrable forest where
modern-day Bucharest stands,
translates the aftermath of revo-
lution into personal reactions
of those who lived through it.
Its author, Caryl. Churchill,
introduces us to two families,
the Vladus and the Antonescus.
Radu Antonescu, an art stu-
dent, loves Florina Vladu, but
their families have other
designs for the children.
Florina’s sister, Lucia, latches
herself on to an American hus-
band and gets out — but not
before she has an affair with a
Hungarian man, which is’ con-
sidered a cultural taboo, and
aborts his child. , '

Forest seems to be the tension
between generations. As revo-
lutionary tales are shared, a
common link bonds speakers
of the same age. All of the
young speakers wanted to run.
toward the revolution in the
square, whereas the older
speakers voiced fear of the
regime and change in general.
Director Richard Keitel
moves the play along through

a series of quiet scenes inter- '

changed with actual script.
These silent “pre-scenes” act as
still—life previews for the action
in some of thesequentia)
scenes. They are to the play
what ﬂowers are in a woman’s
hair: very pretty to look at,
sometimes even poetic, but
highly unnecessary.

As far as the acting is con-
cerned, the company “works as
an ensemble and does an
impressive job with what it’s
been given. Colleen A.

O’Conner especially stands out

as Flavia, Radu’s mother, and
as a young student who yearns
to be involved in the revolu-
tionary activity.
Overall, Mad Forest is a pow-
erful take on the events of
.December 1989. It has many
emotionally explosive
moments, but it also has some
extraneous ones. The play is a
‘plethora of every newsworthy
event in Romania in the past
three years that has been
siphoned through the media

into our living rooms. It touch- I

es on everything from illegal
abortions and the tragic
orphanages to notoriously long
lines for meat.
Mad Forest runs every other
night through Nov. 20 at the
Stephen Foster Memorial.

Here’s more evidence that
the seven—inch single mania in
indie—rock, land shows little

I sign of subsiding. The Simple

Machines label, renowned in

the underground for D.C.--

bands such as Tsunami and its
“Tools” series of compilations
(Lever, Screw, Pulley, etc.),
pull off a doozy —— a box set
of three seven-inches show-
casing a wide variety of bands
from three closely allied
scenes: Richmond, Baltimore
and Washington, D.C. Is this
the fabled Bermuda Triangle
of indie rock? Well, yes and
no.

First up on the Baltimore
disk is the Tear Jerks, the

group that has its own single
on Simple Machines and the
kind of geeky noise-pop that
forces your facial muscles into
an involuntary, silly grin. Then
Candy Machine takes the
stage with some churning rock
that walks the fine line
between Chicago fare,.like Tar
and the D.C. “emo—core”
sound a la Fugazi and Jawbox.
Its song here is at least as
good as the stuff on Candy
Machine’s four-song EP, which
was exquisitely -packaged in
oversized corrugated card-
boardto irritate hipsters with
singles carrying cases. "

The other two Balt tracks
are considerably less‘ appeal-
ing. Slack (not the former

band on Seattle’s C/Z) put ,

Stevie Nicks’ or maybe that
underfecl _waif from the
Throwing Muses. Also, False
Face Society makes an
appearance ,with some off-kil-
ter hippy—jang1e that takes
some noise—spaz breaks now
and again. But what sinks its
track are the horrid bongos,
like some multicultural disease
gone amok.

Richmond fares slightly bet-
ter in this sampler. Now-
defunct -stop—start, prog—rock
heroes Breadwinner (featuring
former Honor Role guitarist

Penn Rollins) contributes a"

very short burst of Rush—with—
balls heaviness, a treat that
lasts about as long as ‘a
Tootsie Pop. Meanwhile, Coral
(with other Honor Role mem-
bers) carries on the textured,
noisy, art—punk tradition of the
former band. This is slow and
good. Other ‘musical "neigh-
bors of Douglas Wilder are
the really bad’ reggae band
Burma Jam and the fair—to~
middling love rock of Fudge,

‘which may have been bitten

by the Olympia bug.

Finally, our nation’s capital
has the best selection avail-
able here, nearly batting
1,000. The Lilys, a shoegazing

band with the ‘CD In the

Presence of Nothing on
Slumberland Records, sound
like Ride, Curve and crew, yet
doesn’t bore you with overim-
itation. Whorl almost sounds
like throwbacks to the British
Factory days, with darkly-
tinged pummel-rock absorbing
the tendencies of, say, Red
Lorry Yellow Lorry or Crispy
Ambulance, but not in a man-
ner as obvious as fellow
Washingtonians Unrest. Here
as well is the usual jungle-
beat track by Bratmobile, the
“riot grrl” trio that continues
to be the female yin to Beat
Happening’s yang. Lastly,
th'ere’s Last (get it?), which
unabashedly rips off Dinosaur

Jr. but still possesses a solid‘

rock foundation. _
The Neapolitan Metropolitan

tag for this compilation was

brought on partly by the liter-

ature inside about the politi—. -

cally correct works of Ben and
Jerry’s ice cream (the three

vinyl colors almost look good ‘

enough to eat, anyway). But
even if you don’t have a han-
kering for frozen desserts, the
music contained within this
beautiful box will make you
shake until the cows come
home.

 PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, November_5, 1992

April  

Continued from page 3

: seeks a month of solace from

the stresses of her married
life.

The third member of this

unlikely quartet of travelers is
a beautiful young socialite,
Lady Caroline Dester (Polly
Walker). Caught up in the
fevered gaiety ofthe Roaring
‘20s, she doesn’t suffer from a
lack of attention, but from too

much. She wishes to disap-'

pear from the grabbing devo-
tions of her many suitors and
get re-acquainted with herself.
Loneliest of all is Mrs.
Fisher, a wealthy widow too
caught up in the memories of
her past to enjoy the present.
“All I want to do,” she ﬂatly
informs Lottie and Rose, “is to
sit in the shade and remember
better times and better men.’’
The women arrive at the
beautiful castle fully intent
upon pursuing their singular

goals, with no intention of.

cultivating friendships. They
weave their way through the
sun—soaked gardens, a par-'
adise 4 of flowers, slowly
absorbing the subtle magic.of
the seaside castle.

Gradually, the women begin
reaching out to one another
instead of turning away.
Finding solace and solitude in
the peaceful gardens, the time
away. from their perceived
problems, allows them to
examine the reasons they felt
a need to escape life in
London. Each woman slowly

begins to redefine herself. As
a new happiness slowly blos-
soms for the four,‘ they
become increasingly eager to
share among themselves and
with others in their lives.
Lottie is the first to respond
to the romance of the old cas-
tle, inviting Mellersh to join
her.__ He comes, most interest-
ed in forming new business
relationships with Lady
Caroline and Mrs. Fisher.
However, - the enchanted
ground of the castle works its
spell on him also, and he and
Lottie fall in love — perhaps
for the first time. Liberated
from the conventions of
upper-middle class London,
the pair rediscover them-

selves, allowing them to fully-

experience each other. One of
the film’s most touching
scenes centers upon this
rediscovery, as.Mellersh slow-
ly, tenderly brushes his wife’s
hair. _

A similar renewal happens
for Rose when her’ husband

- Frederick stops in on his way

to Rome, beginning the
research for his new book.
Frederick never makes it to
Rome, but he and Rose also
succumb to the romance and
rejuvenation of the castle gar-
dens.

In an ‘almost too—perfect
coincidence,‘ the cast-le’s
owner (Michael'—Kitc‘hen as
George Briggs) comes to visit
for an afternoon and ends up
spending the rest of the

month falling in love with
Caroline. One might disbe-
lieve them if this were not
such an incredibly we1l—done
film. Instead, the premise of
their chance meeting is
believable, although it bor-
ders on the unlikely.

Perhaps the best effect of
the castle is the change in
Mrs. Fisher. Affected by the
life andlove surrounding her,
she realizes the folly of con-

stantly reminiscing about the I

past anddecides to “rejoin
the living” and begins actively
adding to both her life and
others. ‘
Mike Newell has created a
lush, beautiful film, carrying a
vibrant message about life.
His slow, sensual camera fol-
lows the women as they dis-
cover the castle and gardens,
often lingering on a particular
piece of artwork or a single
flower. This slow, fluid style
allows us to experience as

much of the characters’ world ,

as possible. Color is used
superbly — London‘ is filmed
in a dull, almost sepia-toned
color film which explodes
into the warm, sun-drenched
colors of the Italian country-
side. '

Some viewers might find
this film slow and predictable.
I did not. Newell does take
his time as his characters
wander through the gardens,
but it works perfectly with
one of the fi11n’s major themes
