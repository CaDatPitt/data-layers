7'5" Student politicking may soon_
be officially as important as
eating turkey and pumpkin on
Thanksgiving and downing
large glasses of Alka Seltzer
the next day.

’ The University appears on the
verge of declaring a recess “asso-
ciated with each primary election
and general election,” applicable A
to most schools, including the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences (CAS). '

CALENDAR ALTERATION
On Monday, _-the University Sen-
fate Council recommended a calen-
dar modification to ensure that no
«recess would "decrease the num-
i ber of class days in the term in ..

-Senate should vote on the propos-
al June 19: _ V V , i .

There’s an underlying sense of

as there is in any minority. To be-

you must pay no dues. There are
no initiation rites, although you
may become “radicalized" dur-
ing a demonstration, or over a
specific issue. You may be push-
ed farther into the political be-
liefs and life style of the New Left
if you meet with some form of
frustration, as any minority be-
comes more united when it finds

Without Confrontation

push you deeper into the under-
ground community.

All you need to belong is a sense
of alienation, some high ideals,
and/or a bit of cynicism, and a
strong wish to see a better socie-
ty. If you lean toward idealism,
you do something to change so-
ciety through peaceful means. If
you lean toward cynicism, you
may either do nothing, believing
that whatever actions you choose
will be in vain, or you may vent
your cynicism through violence.
This approach may or may not be
justified, according to the situa-
tion or your personal viewpoint.

If you stand between idealism
and cynicism. you may believe
that the revolution must come
through individual experience and
the individuals desire to change
himself. Overall. membership
means a new life style a la the
Woodstock Nation.

Not all. but most of the hip
members wear a symbol to’ show
their membership—a symbol that
is sometimes a stigma. The sym-

bol may be an indefinable look that .

comes with living the life style. It
may be "freaky" clothes. or it
may be long hair. If the symbol is
the latter. it means constant con-
frontation with the straight world.
This includes refusal at restaur-
ants. dirty looks and shouted
phrases. and physical abuse.
THE STORY

There are few places in down-

town Pittsburgh where young peo-

Return Requested (In

the words "University of Pitts-
burgh Drill Team" on the left
breast of each). the wearer would
be admitting his guilt if seen.

They could not even be sold,
since they could be traced back to
the salesman. Since the jackets
could be of no use to the thief, they
were taken just for the sake of
taking them. ‘

This would seem to be a highly
irrational act for supposedly ma-
ture university students.

I'd like to propose aldeal for the
person concerned. however hope-
less it may seem.

ple who wear the ‘symbol can go
without meeting this often un-
wanted confrontation. They are
forced to "walk the streets of
Pittsburgh." as one girl put it.
On a pleasant day. you may see
Point State Parkis lawn dotted
with groups of young people——the
"long hair's." the “freaks." the
"hippies." The Point is their com-
mon. There they talk. joke. and
share ideas. Until the YWCA
downtown gave them another. the
Point was the only place where
they could meet.

Between 40 and 60 of the ones
who “walked the streets” now
meet at least once a week at the
“Y” and have formed a type of
“non-organization” called the
Streetpeople. Through this group,
individual members are beginning
to find in real terms rather than
underlying ones -what one member
called a “sense of community and
a senseof trust?”

The Streetpeopte have not felt
any sense of acceptance from so-
cieyt in general or within their
homes. Because of their appear-
ance. they are turned away from
renting some apartments. from
dining in even the informal coffee
shops downtown (there is only one
restaurant downtown where they
can eat with no trouble). and from
simply uninterrupted walks
through town. As far. as their
home lives. an attractive young
girl with long blond hair and wire-
rims named Patti said that "most
parents dont care that much.“ '

Women Want Own LII. House

by DON MARBURY
Editor

A few black and white women
students at the University have

. banded together. demanding the

female equivalant to the relative-
ly new Pitt Intercultural House.
labeling it "discriminatory" and
a "civil rights violation.“

Called the University Student
Committee for a Women's Inter-
cultural House (WICH).‘ they feel
that women‘s inter-racial living
situation is "even more vital and
relevant in today's society than
for men." -

._.-5.

    

JACQUELINE CLAIBORNE

In a prepared statement. six
women students who make up the
executive committee of the group
said. "Although a structure simi-
lar to that which we are about to
propose exists already. it does not
include 51 percent of the problem.
and therefore 51 percent of the so-
lution. which is women.“ '

Jackie Claiborne, a black sopho-
more member of the committee,
which is composed of three blacks
and three whites, stated emphati-
cally, “Everyone is talking about
brotherhood. Well, what about sis-
terhood? One of our members ap-
plied to the Men's‘ Intercultural
House, and was turned down be-
cause of her sex,” she continued,
“and this is in direct violation of
the 1965 Civil Rights Law.-"’

"We are only asking the Univer-
sity to give us the same opportun-
ity that they have given the men."

In a later press conference, Mc-
Govern noted that the Byrd
Amendment to the Church-Cooper
Amendment would grant powers
to the President that would weak-
en the original bill. The senator
commented that should the Byrd
Amendment pass its Thursday
vote, he would ‘vote against the
Church-Cooper Amendment. The
importance of the Church-Cooper

committee member. said. "We
are looking into Pittsburgh foun-
dations that might be interested
in helping us. and the only thing
we ask of the University which it
has not provided for the men is
help in our search for a sponsor-
ing foundation."

The women said they had con-
tacted John Tyler. one of the trus-
tees of the Gertrude Stein Founda-
tion. which funds the Men's Inter-
cultural House. to ask of the pos-
sibility of a women's counterpart.

- but were very dissatisfied with
his answers to their queries.

"We always have to be last to

do everything." said Rosemary -

Robinson. a black sophomore. She
attributed that fact tha: the Inter-
cultural idea was not started with

/women. as a manisfestation of so-
ciety "telling women what they
must be."

WICH has prepared a formal

proposal for the establishment of
a Women’s Intercultural House,
and is now seeking support from

  Publicity

At Bat

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

 

Five days away from their second All-Star game, most of
the Tri-State College Baseball Coaches Association mentors
met at a press luncheon Tuesday in the back room of Frank
Gustine’s Restaurant. The conference proved to be little
‘more than one of finalizing plans for the encounter with a bit
of humor added. College baseball isn’t a big attraction, not
even to the professional sportswriter or sportscaster. '

One scribe from. the Press and one from the Post-Gazette
listened as the coaches talked and introduced three of the
players who will be on the Forbes Field diamon Sunday.

“We want to give recognition to the players in baseball
as they do in other sports,” Owen Daugherty, Commissioner
of the coaching group, explained. “We have as many pros-
spects as other sports. But as coaches we have probablylbeen
lacking in promotion. ' g

The coaches decided to so something about the lack of
publicity for college baseball in the area by establishing the
All-Star gamelast year. The plans were made hurriedly, and
a well- played 3-0 game (practically sans prior publicity) was
witnessed by 258 people at Forbes Field.

This year 5,000 tickets have been sent to high schools,
and the coaches and their players have attempted to sell a

 few to raise the attendance figure. Tickets will also be sold
at the gate Sunday.

After the game the coaches have another talk session
scheduled. It’s listed on -the publicity sheet- as a “happy,
Hour,” which was a good name for the quipping that began
Tuesday when Pitt coach Bobby Lewis interrupted Gustine,
who was talking about the ticket distribution.

“There are a few tickets left, Frank!” Lewis laughed.
Later, Daugherty, who assisted Lewis’ coaching of the

North team in last spring’s 3-0 victory over the South, drop- ‘

ped a challenge upon the Pitt coach, who will act as pitching
coach Sunday. 5 7‘

J \ “Hey, Bob,” Daugherty beckoned. “You know the ERA’s
 a tradition in the North bullpen. That’s 0.00.”

Waynesburg’s Bill Hardisty, one of the South coaches
this year, warned Lewis of the South’s desire to win.

“The South has to win because I’m going to be 39 next
Sunday,” Hardisty said.

That joke was followed by a buzzing of questions concern-

_ ing the Waynesburg coach’s_true age, which he admitted was

over 39. But Daugherty, presiding over the meeting, soon fol-
lowed with the best line of the day.

One of the umpires for the game will come from Steuben-
ville with the Steubenville mentor Bob Kloska who is the
South’s other coach. ' G

1, “Bob’s bringing an umpire along with him,” Daugherty
said. “He took him with him everywhere he went all year.”

Medich Co

Friday, May 12, l970—THE PITT NEiws_‘page)

uld Start In

College All-Star Game

Pitt's George Medich was se-
lected by the New York Yankees
in the Major League’s “second
phase" draft recently, but he has-
n't signed a contract with the
baseball organization. Another

district player has signed a pro-,

fessional contract. though. and the
result could be Medich's starting
Sundays second annual Tri-State
College Baseball Coaches Asso-

' ciation All-Star game.

Larry Potash of Gannon was
named the Associations top left-
handed pitcher, but because of his
professional status he cannot play
in the Star encounter. .Medich
would seem like the probable
choice for starter for the North
team, then, since he was cited as
the district's most outstanding
right handed hurler.

Four other Panthers will play
in the game.

Bob Solonickne will start in
right field for the second consecu-
tive year, and Ron Ogrodnik will
be at short, just as he was last
season.

The two Pitt newcomers to the
game are the team's captain this
spring. Cliff Brown. and freshman
centerfielder Terry Stokes. _

The Association includes the
coaches from most of the Western
Pennsylvania schools, West Vir-
ginia University, Youngstown U.,
and Steubenville. The game is
scheduled to start at 1:35 p.m.

IM Softball Tourney
Comes To A Finish?

The University hasn't found its
intramural (undergraduate soft-
ball champion. The outcome is a-
mystery since the Kavics (the
Glee Club) were forced to post-
pone its semi—final tournament
contest on Wednesday. and will
not play again until Monday.

The winner of the Kavics-

Bloomersmust face the only un-

defeated team in the tournament
play the Pansies. Thus. the Uni-
versity's new softball champ
should be unveiled Tuesday atN6
p.m. at Trees Field.

The Boys in the Band. the only

6 squad to topple the Pansies in
'regular—season competition, has

been beaten twice in tournament
action and therefore have been eli-
minated.

The Bloomers edged the Boys
in the Band, 5-4, as Allen Gins-
berg slugged a three-run homer

and Mark Seltzer belted-in the
game winning runs. Also, Dan
Tanburo collected three hits in
four _at-bats.

A few. days later. the ZBT's_

knocked-off the Bands Boys. 11-
10, despite Tom Dolan's home
run. Bob Lacasse’s round-tripper
and two singles dented the Band.

The Pansies have been the only
club to upset the Bloomers in the
tourney, 8-5. Dan Lynn and Fran
Kramer tripled, and Jim LeJeune.
who has slammed 12 hits in 22 at-
bats throughout the season, went
3-4. The ZBT‘s lost to the Pansies.
10-9. The ZBT rally fell short as
they scored two runs in final inn-
ing and held the opposition to just
one run in the last three innings.
Bob Hagner. Jim LeJeune. and
Dave, Cobb all homored for the
Pansies. The following night. the
Kavics eliminated the ZBT's. 9-7.
