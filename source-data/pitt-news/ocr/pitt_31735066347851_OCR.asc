Season No. 4

 Was No. 1
or Panthers

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

E‘ In the late ‘60s and early ‘70s,
Pitt students and the handful of
other Panther Football
followers didn’t spend pre-
seasons contemplating how
their team would fare that year.
Even with the declining ad-
mission standards that accom-
panied Pitt’s move to state-
related status, anyone capable
of satisfying the University’s
entrance requirements could ‘see
the team would stink.
But Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, after spending the first
v - several years of his tenure on an
attempt to retire the huge debts
 her inherited in 1967, got
*5 together with a number of
“friends of the Univeristy” and
it was decided Pitt would go all-
out in its effort to regain
national football prominence.
Before that decision was
made, Pitt fans -wagered not on
each game, but rather on which
single game they believed
, (hoped?) the team would
manage to win during an entire
season. Four years later, they
were wearing “Pitt No. l” but-

~ t 4 The-past tenmonths were some of
the most eventful in Pitt’s 190-year
history, mixing the ecstacy of a
national football championship with
the tragedy of an on-campus
explosion that killed two persons.

New names and faces emerged on V
campus, people such as Marxist
Paul Nyden and former black
studies instructor Yusef Ali, in
addition to old ones——-Wesley

Posvar, Jerome Rosenberg and
Tony Dorsett.

Persons of national prominence
also touched the University—Jerry
Brown, Ralph Nader and Angela
Davis immediately come to mind.

Events close to home and far
away diverted the mainstream of
University life in one way or
another--the strike by Port Author-
ity Transit employes and a nuclear
blast on mainland China.

In summary, the 1976-77 school
year compiled a vivid event-ﬁlled
diary.

Klingons Attack Trustees

Starship Dama

BY DUSTIN HOFFMAN
AND ROBERT REDFORD

The top 15 floors of the Cathedral
of Learning were seriously damag-
ed late last night during an
hour-long surprise attack upon a
Board of Trustees meeting by a
Federation Starship.

Injured by phaser attacks were
Board of Trustees Chairman
William H. Rea, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, Professor Rudolf Emeritus
and janitor I.N. Adrum.

No speciﬁc reason for the

_ extraterrestrial attack has been

ascertained, according to acting

Chancellor Cas Myslinski. “It is ‘

possible, though, the attack was an
attempt to pressure the University
to reconsider its decision not to
renew the contract of Klingon
professor Paul Nzxrtp,” he said.

The Federation vessel made
three swift swoops past the aged
University building, each time
ﬁring short—range phaser bursts
into the heart of the building.

“It was your classical alien
attack," acting Assistant to the
Chancellor Johnny Majors noted.
“It was obvious they were trying to
beam a landing party to the
Cathedral. I don’t know why it

I a failed. I-like.”

One eyewitness reported seeing
three Panther football players hurl
half-empty cans of Iron at the craft
while on their way home from the
Keg. It disappeared soon after,
the bystander said.

A spokesthing from the Provi-
sional Klingon Government embas-
sy took credit for the attack and
said‘ more could be expected. “Us
felt Burger Chef was putting out a
substance that threatened life in
this solar system as us know it. Us
did the only thing your conscience
would allow.”

Pitt Students for Klingon Re-
form, the Third World Creatures
Coalition and the Commuter
Association all lauded the attack.

A spokesman from the office of
Governor Milton Shapiro, however,

The top floors of the Cathedral were seriously damaged last night
when a Klingon starship attack interrupted a meeting of the Board of

Trustees. Four persons were injured.

condemned the attack. “Wanton
destruction. That’s all it is. What if
everyone went around doing this?
There wouldn’t be any tall
buildings left,” he said in aspeech
before the Pennsylvania Elevator
Operators Association.

Rumors the Klingon ship had
been rented by members of the
Student Coalition Against just
about anyTHing (SCATH) could
not be veriﬁed. but there were
strong indications the pending
tuition hike may have been a cause
of the incident.

In other business, the Trustees
approved a motion to purchase the
Blawnox Sewage Disposal plant. for
use as student housing. They
vetoed a motion to set ﬁre to the
Student Union at noon on Wednes-
day.

The April Fool's day meeting
was recessed immediately after
the attack and will not reconvene
until the radiation subsides.

Theft, Exposures are Common Campus Crimes

Police Describe

Crime Picture

By MARY S. HUZINEC

‘ ‘Parents will always worry about
their children’s safety on campus,”
Charles Westbrooks admitted.
“Take it from me——I have six kids
who will probably be coming to Pitt.
When they enter school I’m going to
be very concerned about campus
security.”

Sound like a typical parent? Yes,
Westbrooks is—but he is also a
knowledgeable man on the subject
of campus crime. He's the campus
police Community Relations Spec-
ialist and his job is to keep the public
informed about Oakland’s crime.

Westbrook said for a crime to be
committed desire and opportunity
must be present. If a potential
criminal never gets the chance to
complete his planned crime, the
community has good security.

According to Pitt campus police
Chief Curt Graham, Pitt has a full
service department with officers
continuously on duty to assist
students.

‘ ‘We assign two officers to patrol
the interior and exterior of the

if By PETE BUTCH

A freshman who’s seen every-
thing worth seeing in Oakland
during orientation will see only part
of Pitt’s system.

Pitt has four regional campuses
located in the rural Pennsylvania
communities of J ohnstown, Greens-
burg, Bradford and Titusville.

“All regional campuses are not
the same,” explained Associate
Provost for Regional Campuses,
Robert Nossen. “Each oﬁers
programs not available not avail-
able in Oakland, along with the

basic College of Arts and Sciences
courses students take in their first
two years.”

When students apply to Pitt they
indicate, in order of preference, the
campuses they wish to attend.
More students select Oakland as
their first choice than there is
available space. It is then necessary
to refer some students to their
second-choice campus.

Students are referred to a
regional campus if they have not
been admitted to an exclusively
main campus program. Admission
offices think a student gets more
benefit from a smaller campus and
more individual attention.

Students with low high school

dorms seven days a week and have

an additional two walking beats‘

every day,” Graham said.

“Thirty-three of our officers are
Emergency Medical Technicians
and can handle most medical
emergencies,” he continued, “and
an ambulance is always on patrol.”

Data compiled by Lieutenant Sam
Conte and Sergeant Jim Watters
reveals theft is the most prevalent
campus crime. Theft accounts for
42.7 percent of all reported campus
crimes. Disorderly conduct,

CURT GRAHAM

behavior with intent to cause public
inconvenience, was second and
criminal mischief, destroying tan-
gible property, was third.

The highest crime areas, in order,
are the (1) Towers and quadrangle,
(2) Scaife Hall, and (3) Presbyterian
Hospital, Lothrop Residence and
Trees Hall.

In 1976 Oakland was the second
lowest crime rate area in the city for
major index crimes such as murder,
rape, burglary and robbery. In fact,
there were no rapes on campus
last year and only two reported
attempts.

According to Watters the local
crime picture is changing. “As-
saults usually occur in the late
afternoon and early evening now,”
he said. “The prime time is 3 to 8
p-m-”

“The biggest problem is student
carelessness,” Westbrooks said.
To inform students about the
campus police and campus crime,
he wrote a brochure, “It’s Time to
Start Thinking Realistically About
Safety.” The brochure lists
locations of emergency telephones
on campus and offers students
suggestions to protect themselves
on or off campus.

You can get the brochure at the
June 19th orientation presentation

are considered by admission ofﬁces

The rest of the regional student
body consists of ﬁrst-choice appli-

that each extention offers.

Nossen refuted the notion
students referred to regional
campuses don’t have the academic
promise of those who go to Oakland.

Last Year's

Typical Crimes

By BETSY NORMAN

Pitt’s campus has all the potential
crime problems of a big city. Cam-
pus crime runs the gamut from bike
theft to indecent exposure. While
many of the crimes have a
humorous note and can be solved
easily, others have serious implica-
tions which warrant further investi-
gations by campus and city police.

Persons outside the University
community commit a large percen-
tage of campus crimes.

The following are some of the
more serious crimes frequently
occurring on campus:

Two males, 23 and 20, were
arrested May 21 when one tried to
pull a .357 Magnum revolver on
campus police who ‘observed them
smoking marijuana in their car on
the 100 block of Bouquet Street.
The gun was stolen in a 1975
burglary.

Cit

An intoxicated 25-year-old man
was arrested for aggravated assault
in front of the Wooden Keg June
12. Campus police, who observed
the patron ﬁghting with the
doorman at the Keg, broke up the
ﬁght.

Graduate's Future Is

Major--Dependent

By DAVID MOYLES

A Pitt graduate’s job prospects
largely depend on his major.

Engineering, natural science and
health professions students have
very good chances of employment,
said‘ Dan Nagy, coordinator of
placement, while the less employ-

able liberal arts major should have 9

Tuition Hike of

on-the-job experience, a good
academic record and be willing to
hustle for a job. ‘

Nagy said the hiring of engineers
follows a peak and valley cycle
which is now at its crest with 90 to 95
percent of this year's graduates
finding employment. Chemical
engineers command the highest
starting salaries, $16 to $17
thousand dollars a year.

The natural science student is in
demand, said Nagy, though this
demand is decreasing. Most jobs
require a master’s or doctorate
degree.

The modernization and increas-
ing specialization of medicine has
created favorable chances for
employment in areas such as
nursing, pharmacy and medical
technology.

‘ ‘If a person wants to put forth the
effort, he will find employment,”
Nagy said, stating 40 percent of
liberal arts majors graduating from
Pitt find employment by June, while
70 percent of them are employed by
September.

Internships and practicums in-
crease the liberal arts major’s
employability. On-the-job exper-
ience means more to an employer
than grades and club involvements,
Nagy said, though the latter also are

. factors in getting a job.

Nagy advises the student with a
less marketable major, such as
philosophy, to take a minor
attractive to an employer-—busi-

A Master of Business Arts is a
good degree for those liberal arts
graduates who decide to study
further, Nagy said, but a higher
degree in a less employable ﬁeld
opens up college teaching positions
andlittle else.

12% Slated

By ANGELE ELLIS

A tuition increase, the third since
1974, will raise the price of a Pitt
full-time undergraduate°education
by $100 (12%) in the 1977-78 school
year.

Medical students will suffer this
fall as well, after a $1000 hike upped
medical tuition to a record 4,000 per
year for Pennsylvania residents.
Med school tuitiion was $1,500 in
1974. Out-of-state medical students
will now pay $6000 per year.

Dental students also face a large
tuition increase; an added $600 will
hike in-state tuition to 3,100 per
year. Out-of-state rates will rise by
$1,000, to $5,000 yearly.

And the hikes are likely to keep
coming, even though Pitt tuition is
significantly higher than that at
State universities in Ohio, West
Virginia, New York and other
neighboring states.

The legislators, however, main-
tained that an increase in Pitt
funding would necessitate a tax
hike, an unpopular measure in the
1970s scene.

Student Government-Role Debcited Constantly

Editor’s Note: Deanna Louise is the
Pitt News Student Government Board
reporter. Ariy opinions in this story
developed from her tenure in that post.

By DEANN A LOUISE

Pitt’s Student Government has
been described as quioxtic, dili-
gent, unresponsive, too political,
not political enough, stingy and
extravagant.

The debate over student govern-
ment’s role at Pitt and the form it
should take is perennial. Few facets
of its purpose are generally

 

excepted. Whether functions are
fulfilled each year and furthered the
next is usually fodder for debate.
The seven members of its
executive body, Student Govern-
ment Board (SGB5, oversee the
standing committees, and numer-

ous nicheless projects. They hear A

allocations appeals from many of
the 117 Pitt student organizations
A and set the priorities for distribution

of some $298,000 in student"

activities fees each year.

ALLOCATING STUDENT FUNDS

Tuition has increased, but the
student activities fee revenue has
not. This summer many organiza-
tions are appealing cutbacks in what
they consider essential funding.

The Allocations Committee of
student government, weighs each
group’s requests for funding and
makes recommendations to SGB,
which then hears appeals.

Sometimes these hearings last
ﬁve or six hours; both a person’s
ﬁscal sense and patience are
assessed by the board when
appointing committee members.

Presently Allocations Committee
members, SGB members and about

 

D/we I/estoznce

15 other student leaders receive a
token stipend for their many hours
of service.

Although student leaders have
shouldered, criticism for these
remunerations, the retribution they
receive for the time spent working
diligently makes J .P. Stevens labor
practices seem laudable in compari-
son. ‘

Advocates of a voluntary student

administration have sound argu-
ments for trashing the present pay
system. Their suggestion is
admirable, but some say inconsis-
tent with the logic dominating
business practices today.

Both sides have defendable
stances, and remuneration may be
ditched again as it has been in the
past.

EVERYBODY LOVES AWINNER

Retribution for duty, however,
should not be the first consideration
of a Student Government Board
candidate. The pay is bad and
criticism comes from every quarter.

Last year's board initiated the
fresh food co-op, now steadily
supported. But feedback about the
project, which was a major inroad in‘
student services, was negligible
compared to criticism the board
received from the Black Action
Society for being allegedly unre-
sponsive to the needs of Pitt’s black
students.

SGB campaign pleges are always
appealing and often grandiose.
Students should consider what SGB
can reasonably effect before blindly
trailing after the light of promise. .

Candidates who claim they can
make changes former regimes did
not because they are more diligent,
aggressive and dedicated are
probably not well acquainted with
student government at Pitt.

Pledges to tear.-up buerocratic
sideroads and increase student
voice in decision-making cannot be
fulﬁlled in a year or 10 vears or
maybe ever.

But only mass student support
can effect desired changes.

GOVERNMENT

SGB President Bernie Payne
pledged to return student govern-
ment to the students during his
-campaign last February.

He instituted the Student Assem-
bly approved by the referendum,
which established an advisory body’
to SGB of student organization
representatives. He moved SGB
meetings to spacious public forums
in the Student Union and even
varied session times to accomodate
students with class time-conﬂicts.

As it happened, SGB instituted a

budget freeze to punish nearly half *

the student organizations which did
not submit the names of their
representatives to the assembly.
Only 21 groups attended the
assembly’s first meeting last
month. And, when SGB brought its
meetings to the students attend-
ance and interest conspicuously
dwindled with each successive shot.
When the student population
returns in the fall, SG may be
re—energized. But what has occured
thus far may be interpreted to show
that students’ complaints about
SGB irresponsibility backﬁred.

SGB has come to the students
this year. What remains to be seen
this fall is whether the students will
welcome them with open arms or
ﬂee in retreat. '

For those freshmen with political
aspirations for their four years at
Pitt, the student government office
is in Room 305 of the Student Union.
The student government standing
committee chairmen welcome in-
put. The committees are: the

Elections Committee, Homecoming ‘

Committee, Programming Commit-
tee, Allocations Committee, _ Com-
mittee on Student Organizations
Freshman Fall Weekend Commit-
tee, Medical Action Committee,
Public Relations Committee and

Our Purpose——Service

THE BOOK CENTER is owned and operated by the University of
Pittsburgh. The primary chllenge facing the Book Center today is one
of extending service to the students of the University, its many depart-
ments, faculty, staff and alumni.

Organizational Structure

THE BOOK CENTER is a departmental operation. Merchandise or
services offered are catagorized into four given areas or departments.
These are textbooks, new and used, trade, supplies and sundries. All
buying for these areas is premised on three basic principles. First the
item must be required for a given course or program of the University.
Items of this type are naturally the textbooks, used books, and paper-
backs. Second, trade department items are made available that are
necessary to supplement and complement the course study and to en-
hance the cultural and academic significance of the University. Third,
supply department on the lower ﬂoor has supply items for your every
need, paper, notebooks, typewriters, and hundreds of other items.
Fourth, sundries department has all the professional items, engineering
supplies, art supplies, records, pens and pencils and the availability of
many items extremely professional.

"7 I Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

This Is College

It is with very little trepidation that we welcome this year’s group
of new students staying at Pitt for a three-day mutual look—see.
Though Pitt’s attractiveness as an educational bargain has
diminished somewhat of late, thanks to a curious state aversion to

funding quality higher education,

we hope you enjoy much of what

you see here and leave Wednesday with a good impression.

Don’t expect Pitt to be merely a continuation of high school; if
that is how you perceive it, that is how you will experience it and
you will have ignored a great opportunity to enjoy the great times
your college career offers. Take advantage of your independence.

But don’t expect college to come to you and surround you with
good times and valuable experiences. As you make mistakes, you’ll
pay for them. For most of you, however, the withdrawals will far
outweigh the deposits you choose to make and the penalties you’re

forced to pay.

Black Experience

By GEORGE VAN HOOK

The beat goes on. The beat goes
on. Drums keep pounding rhythms
to my head.

The lyrics to this popular Sonny
and Cher hit in my estimation
accurately describe the relationship
of the black student to this
white-dominated university. The
black student still dances to the
constant beat of a “racist”
drummer, a drummer who has
changed his beat slightly but not the

. meaning of his song. In spite of the

years of “lip service” given the
black community on campus, it
seems that the administration is
content to keep blacks right where
they are—-on the bottom.

The University over the past
decade has played an artful game of
deception. It would have you
believe that it is interested in the
black student, faculty and staff; but,
when you check out its “act,” you
see just the opposite. A good
example is the poor ﬁnancial

support received by UCEP and

black studies. The university
consistantly gives black studies and
UCEP just enough to survive. The
excuse given every year is that the

budget is tight. But the true reason 2

is the nonchalant attitude it has

about blacks. V
The problems black students face

largely stem from the fact they view
the white administrator as the
legitimate “owner” of this institu-
tion. Many black students believe
the white man is doing them a favor
by allowing them to study at his
university. Likewise, whites here
believe like they are doing the black
student a favor. What both fail to
realize is that Pitt is a public
institution supported by the tax
dollars of citizens. Consequently.
all Pennsylvanians have a legiti-
mate right tobe at this institution
and black people are included inthis
number. The school belongs to the

' public.

Because the black student views
this university as an arm of the
white power structure, to which he
is alien, there is a reluctance to
actively involve himself with the
structures that make up this
university. Perceiving a deﬁnite

adversary relationship, he keeps his
distance from-those programs and
services which are run by “the
man.” This is particularly true of
support services (i.e. job place-
ment, counseling, writing work-
shop, personal counseling) which
have a very bad track record when it
comes to the black student. It
should also be noted that an
extremely negative or insensitive
attitude exists on the part of many
white staff members who admini-
strate the various programs and
departments of the university.

Essentially, there is a, mutual
distrust and dislike which creates a
formidable barrier to black student-
white staff interaction. The same
thing is evident in the relationship
between the black student _and
white professor.

It was in the year 1787 that the
University of Pittsburgh was born.
Nearly 180 years later the seeds of a
black community were planted! It is
important to note that the
administration opposed the effort to

create a workable black community —

on campus. Black students and
community forces, through the
Black Action Society (BAS), had to
ﬁght a ﬁerce struggle. The basic
goal of BAS was to create a
“substantial black community and
an atmosphere in which black
students could survive without the
hangups...” That the university
was and is‘ interested in these goals
is evident by the fact black students
had to “sieze” the Cathedral
computer station before getting the
attention of the academic commun-
ity. ’

The immediate. response of the
academic community was rhetoric.
Chancellor Posvar said in a January
1969 statement: “The problem of
racial injustice is the most critical
domestic issue facing this nation
and thus every institution must
help...” - He committed" the
university to a massive recruitment
drive to increase the number of
black students faculty and staff.
The Chancellor went on to say, “I
believe that progress in our racial
programs is inevitable. The only
question is_whether that progress
will be made smooth by reason and
conscience, or made difficult but
mindless bias or opportunism.”

History bears out the fact that
black studies and UCEP were
formed but the “inevitable pro-
gress” the Chancellor referred to
seemed‘ to have stopped right there.

To be sure, there have been drastic
increases in the number of black
students and there are now more
courses available with a black
orientation. But are the majority of
these black students graduating
with usable educational skills? The
answer to the question is a
Is black studies
receiving the support necessary to
realize it's full potential? The

: Pitt's Nonchalani Attitude

The attempts of UCEP and black
studies to keep pace with the
growing demands of a larger
constituency have been met with
severe budgetary and policical
constraints.

In 1977, I must painfully
acknowledge the fact that racism
still runs rampant on this campus
and black people still are engaged in
a ﬁerce struggle for their survival.
Dr. Jack L. Daniel, associate dean of
the CAS, alluded to this fact in an
October BAS news article entitled,
“Beyond Access, Black Students’
Success at White Universities.” In

this article Daniel stated, ‘ ‘Let us be
clear that instituitonal racism
hardly turned over in its sleep much
less died during the decade of the
sixties...black attendance of pre-
dominately‘ white institutions still
constitutes a matter of culture in
encounter.”

One should not confuse the
tremendous strides made by black
athletes of the choosing of a black
student government president with
significant progress of the black
student body. / Equally, the
appointment of a few deans and
associate deans does not suggest

overall progress for the ' black
faculty.

V Progress will be made when all
blacks (faculty, students and staff)
can enjoy the privileges which are
characteristic of a free academic
community. Right now this is not
the case, but hopefully in the future
it will be. If Pitt can build a national
football team in a mere three years,
surely it can support the develop-
ment of black community power. In
my mind, the task of black
community development is inﬁnite-
ly more important than scoring
touchdowns. Meanwhile, the beat
goes on.

Father's Day: Let's Ban It

By KEN GORMLEY

Father’s Day should be banned.
You heard me right. I said Father’s
Day should be banned. But before
you accuse me of being a dirty,
rotten, God-hating commie (or
worse), give me a chance to plead
my case.

Let’s face it. By the time us poor
kids end up in college, we’re at the
crossroads of life (we’re too old -
and far too big - to bat an eyelash
when dad says “you do that or
else. ’ ’ But we’re too young - at least
that’s what we’re told ~ to be fathers
ourselves.) And at this awkward
stage in life, Father’s Day can be a
truly traumatic experience.

We spend a full, carefree year of
tramping around the house in
muddy boots, scratching up the
family car, and being just plain
ornery towards dear old dad. But all
of a sudden, when Father’s Day
rolls around, we’re expected to
swallow our prides, cause no
trouble, and bob around the house
nodding our heads agreeably to
everything dad_ says.

Not to mention the presents.
Yep, We have to spend a good
night's beer money on a couple of
those imported cigars in fancy
plastic containers. And there we sit
in the living room while dad blows
smoke rings and reads his new
Esquire magazine, wishing to hell
we could sneak outside and spend
the rest of the day crushing ants or
something. The whole idea of
Father’s Day is just too unnatural.

Many of you probably still think
I’m a commie. Father’s Day
unnatural? Is it unnatural to show
your love and respect for the man
who brought you into this world? Is
it unnatural to show your gratitude
to the man who puts bread on your
table and gas in your car? Why you
dirty, lousy, ungrateful...

Settle down. You just aren’t
looking at the matter rationally.
Just between you and me, even
college students...uh, ummm...
even college students love their

. ‘“°“' '2“ ‘?“"'3 3”‘? .’

between you and me). But we show
our love in a - you might call it
“unusual” manner. _

The first thing you have to realize
is that we college kids are bv nature
verv skeptical. A!1dY0“’d bet“?
believe that if anyone, even dad, is
foolish enough to give us something
to argue about, we'll leap on the
opportunity.

(EXAMPLE: Dad - “It's a shame
to see that poor guy Nixon taking so
much grief from everyone. He
never did anything worse than any
other president. He just got
caught.”

Son - “What do you mean? That
guy’s nothing but a lying, cheating
bum. He deserves to be hung by his
fat jowels and shot.”)

Besides being skeptical (which is
both natural and healthy), us
college students tend to_ be a very
proud breed. After all, we've been
taught for twenty or so years that
the only way to get ahead in this
crazy world is to get the upper hand
in everything we do. So even
though we think pop is a great guy -
and secretly agree with almost
everything he says - we can ’t let him
know that.

(EXAMPLE: Dad - “I’m glad
that Nixon guy is ﬁnally getting the
grief he deserves. The man’s

nothing buy a lying. cheating
bum.”
Son - “C’mon. The poor man

now: didanvthina that anvone else
in his shoes wouldn’t do. He inst
happened’ to get caught. That’s
what’s wrong with all you
old-timers...never want to cut
anyone a break.”)

Now, hopefully, you can see why
the whole idea of F ather’s Day is so
absurd. A whole day of sitting
around the house_trying to think of

pleasant jokes to exchange with the I

old man (not to mention the cigars.
If only they’d explode...) just isn’t
what father-son relationships are
built on.

And most fathers understand this
perfectly. They were ornery,
quick-to-argue kids once too. (If
anything, Father’s Day drives many
dads to mope around and wonder
“where did I go wrong?” Nobody

wants a kid who sits around talking.

about the weather and foolishly
spending his allowance on crummy
Cuban cigars instead of putting it to
good use in a bar.). '

But, now that I think of it, I guess
it wouldn’t be a very good idea to
ban Father’s Day. Our mothers
would just never understand.

first two terms of nursing or
pharmacy, the ﬁrst three terms of
engineering, or the ﬁrst four terms

As for regional students’ perfor-
mance over four years, Nossen‘
pointed out that Johnstown engin-
eering students rate among the
highest scorers in statewide engin-
eering tests.

“If it were true that Oakland
students were better students, then
none of them would flunk out,”
Nossen said.

Johnstown, in Cambria County,
is the oldest of the regional
campuses. It was founde4dgingl927;

the others were founded in 1963.
Pitt once had campus extentions
spread all over the state in a
network as large as Penn State’s is
today. According to Nossen, the
system became overextended be-
cause of lack of student interest.
Consequently, campuses like
Uniontown and Erie shut down.

“A growth potential does exist
for today’s regionals,” Nossen said,
“but it’s up to the University on the
whole to plan its facilities.”

“The regional campuses make
their fund requests, and the
University grants the ones which ﬁt
its priorities,” he said.

“Offering the right kind of
programs will continue to attract
students,” Nossen continued.
“Today, there are students not

.' ;»‘4'-"' T i

 

inclined to leave home who locate
closer to their hometown. There are
adults who want adult education
courses. Because of this, regional
campuses will continue to grow
despite a general population
decline.”

Greensburg is an especially
promising campus, Nossen ex-
plained, because it is in Westmore-
land County, the fastest growing
county in Western Pennsylvania.

Enrollment at Johnstown is
restricted because too many
students request it. “Johnstown’s
student body could increase 30 to 40
percent if we let it,” Nossen
estimated.

Tenure streams at regional
campuses are separate from the one

 
 

at the main campus. “The regional, ‘ I I

faculty are recruited for teaching

effectiveness, but a high degree of‘

professional activity is also expect-
ed,” Nossen said’. —

According to Nossen, there is
more professional activity at
Johnstown than at other regional
campuses. “At Oakland teaching
loads and facilities are geared for
research. At the regionals,

teaching loads are heavier and

facilities are limited—but our

' people are productive,” he added.

Statistics compiled by Pitt’s office
of Institutional Research for Plan-
ning _and Budget show the student

‘to faculty ratio is lower for the
.Faculty of Arts and Sciences in

Oakland than it is for any of the four
regional campuses. According to

director Marilyn Brown, this is

indicated because data for Oakland

teach recitations for professors. At

by the faculty.
The Oakland FAS student to

teacher ratio is 14 to 1. At
Johnstown it is 20 to 1; at the other
regional campuses it is 17 to 1.

The heavier teaching workload
translates into 13.35 faculty credit
hours taught per term. Oakland’s
average is 9.35 credit hours per
term but this includes the teaching
load of TAs and TFs.

According to Bradford’s Dean of
Instruction, Paul Robinson, Pitt’s
extention in this town near the New
York State border provides, “a
major university with a small
campus atmosphere. The courses
we deliver for students who relocate
are geared to the Pitt system. Our
faculty are judged by their
acceptabilty to this system.”

The Bradford campus completed
a move from a downtown storefront
to the site of an old airport two years
ago. One of its old hangars is used
as a temporary student union. A
gymnasium has recently been

constructed, along with two aca-
demic buildings and dorm space for
450 to 500 students.

The new gym was built for $1.2
million, with funds raised entirely
from local industries.

“The industries in the area are
very supportive of Bradford’s
efforts,” Robinson said, “Many oil
companies are in the region, along
with Dresser Industries (a manufac-
turing conglomerate located in
Dallas, Texas that got its start
making couplings and other items

.for oil pipelines in Bradford) and

Zippo cigarette lighter company, to
name a few.

“People here believe in what
we’re trying to do,” Robinson
continued. “Bradford has a young,
well-qualiﬁed, dedicated faculty
and staff. Most have been recruited
over the past three years from major
institutions.’ ’

Tuition at another state support-

This lack of concern for higher

tuition increases. The Pennsylvania
State legislature refused to grant
Pitt an asked-for $9.1 million
increase in funding this year leaving
Pitt’s 1977-78 state allocation at
$61.9 million of a $199.7 million
operating budget.

are not likely to allieviate the

situation.

At the May 17 meeting at which
the $199.7 million 1977-78 Pitt
operating budget was approved,

These statements are backed by
facts: between 1973 and 1975, Pitt’s
tuition jumped 14 percent, and the
number of freshmen from families
(below the national median dropped
ﬁve percentage points. Last year's
six percent tuition hike and the )
caused tuition here to rise 100
percent in four years.”

Pitt Trustee Ruggiero Aldisert
accused the state of “welching on
promises made Pitt in the sixties
and forcing a public policy that has

Aldisert and Trustees Sheila W.
Rathke and Al Lawson voted against
the proposed budget.

Rathke, a school of General '31
Studies student appointed to the
Board of Trustees by Governor
Shapp, noted that many upperclass-
men, as well as underclassmen, had
been forced to leave Pitt due to

recent tuition hikes.

Another solution posed to solve
Pitt’s budget woes is administrative
cutbacks.

A $3.5 million reduction in
physical plant and general operat-
ing costs was included inthe 1977-78
budget.

Also included in the budget,
however, were a $5.1 million
increase in utility costs and building
maintenance and $5.4 million for
faculty and staff salary raises.

“We’ve squeezed things as dry
as we can,” Chancellor Posvar said
at the Trustee meeting, going on to
‘say that further cutbacks would
have a debilitating effect at Pitt.

Posvar, who also said that budget
plans gave students and academics
high priority, apologized for the
tuition increases but put responsi-
bility squarely on the state.

“The lion's share of the problem
is the state’s policy of funding,”
Posvar said.

careers as teachers face decreasing
demand with each jyear’s lowering
student enrollment. Fields of
concentrated study—speech and
hearing, special education and
special readings-—are fairly solid.

Over-specialization occurs when
the engineer takes few liberal arts
offerings or the liberal arts student
avoid technical courses. Both
situations are undesirable to an

Union. The presentation is to
inform parents and students what to
expect regarding crime and security
at Pitt. Westbrooks and several
ofﬁcers will be present to answer
questions and show slides.

‘ ‘Crime tends to be down in areas
where the public is well informed, ’ ’
Westbrooks said. “That's why the
Pitt campus police are interested in
remaining a service oriented
organization. We want to keep the
campus as safe as possible.”

Pitt students major in the natural
sciences. Many are pre-meds,

pre-health, or pre-dents. ‘Students
should not feel locked into their
major, however, Harper said, citing
the popularity of the undecided
‘major.

Nagy said approximately 74
percent of white collar workers are
dissatisﬁed with their jobs, having
made the wrong decisions in college
due to parental inﬂuence, desire for

status or misconceptions about the ‘

career they chose.

“I don’t regard changing majors
as a signiﬁcant problem,” Harper
said. “The student who has not

I,

By CRISTOPHER C. HOEL

When your graduation-present
digital clock tells you it’s midnight
and your stomach lets you know the
last of the cafe'teria’s veal
whatever-it-was has gone, you'll
understand why so many fast-food
stops litter Oakland. Since few
Towers rooms are equipped with
kitchens, a dorm student soon
learns to budget a couple of dollars
each night for a trip to the strip.

Oakland has most of the major
very-fast food varieties. McDon-
ald’s, on Forbes Ave., is just like
any other, except the Golden
Arches are smaller. It’s open until 2
a.m.

Its more-expensive-for essential-
1y-the-same-bacteria-free-patty
counterpart, Burger King, is the
newest of Oakland’s eateries.
Located on the corner of Fifth Ave.
and Oakland Ave. , it is closest to the
dorms. It’s burgers are better, the
french fries not as good.

Taco Hut, one of the better
places, is on Forbes Ave. next to the

King’s Court theater. The burritos,

are recommended; the hot sauce is
not. The place is clean, the service
quick, and the people are unbeliev-
ably friendly.

Roy Rogers’ place, right in the
middle of the strip at Forbes and
Oakland has the best American

 

food. Expect to spend $2 or so,
but after you get past the waitress
“Howdy, pardner,” enjoy the best
conventional food offered by the
quickies. The roast beef is good,
but rare unless you specify a
preference. Specials are frequent.
Pitt football is featured, and the
place is expanding.

My Place is a rather-fast service
restaurant on Oakland, up from Gus
Miller’s newsstand. A variety of
made-to-order burgers and home-
made soups are offered, and prices
aren’t too high. The place closes
amazingly early, though, so it’s a
better bet for lunch.

The infamous “O” is situated
right across from the Law Building
on Forbes Ave. and has been a
legend at Pitt for years. Famous for
hot dogs, it also serves its own
brand of unusual, ﬁlling fries and
offers inexpensive hoagies at the
back grill. And if you want beer an
it’s dark out, the “O” is the only
game in town for take-out. The
pizza is cheap, too. The Hawaiian
punch is superb.

“Sorrento’s Pizza is on Atwood,
down from Giant Eagle. Rather
expensive, but very good. The pizza
bagels are interesting and not so
much a wallop to the wallet. The
soft drinks are extremely expens-
ive.

can get a complete dinner—includ--
ing vegetables—there. Kentucky
Fried Chicken is all the way down
Forbes, by the Playhouse, and
not-so-far down Forbes is Arby’s.
Closer still is the Bamboo Garden, a
Chinese establishment with fantas-
tic lunch specials. The fried rice is
especially good, and the food is
different. i

biggest selling point. It does draw
crowds, though.

Antonino’s Pizzerina, on 5.
Craig, serves good pizza and
hoagies at reasonable prices until 2
a.m. Across the street is Gino’s and
Pete’s pizza, with higher prices but
a wider selection.

You can eat at most places
mentioned for approximately $2-
at some places -they’ll ask you for

additional change, at others they

could return some.

But the most interesting culinary
experience for Pitt students lies not
in Oakland but in the Strip District
between Oakland and Downtown. It
can be found, inexpensively, at
Primanti. Bros., a restaurant-and-
bar located in that part of the city
marked by wholesale produce
markets and truck wharehouses.

Sandwiches at Primanti’s are
unusual, to say the least, and
delicious". Thick slices of Italian
bread surround your choice of ﬁlling
(pepper and egg to bacon and
cheese -to tuna and steak) and-
here’s the distinctive part-Qole
slaw and french fries. A favorite
with fraternities, Primanti’s opens
at midnight and closes at mid-after-‘

noon. . P

But if Oakland is your territory
and you haven't signed a contract
with the Dallas Cowboys for a
million dollars lately, get used to
Oakland’s fast-food strip. They all
have something to offer, though
Roy Rogers’ and the Taco Hut stand
out for various reasons.

From Books to Pigeons: What to do at Pitt

By DAN KACZMARSKI

.Most people are familiar with

those travel booklets which promise
the tourist a slam-bang time in the
big city for $5 a day.

Such economy is probably
possible, given a taste for
Y.M.C.A.s and extended periods-of
fasting. One of the more valuable
services that these publications
provide, however, is helping the
newcomer ﬁnd free or inexpensive
sights and activities.

Though Pittsburgh has not
traditionally been considered a
mecca for sightseers, it does ff H

   
 

number of attractions to help the
budget-wise student kill that
occasional afternoon when ‘ ‘Organ-
ismic Biology” looks especially
unpalatable.

Oakland is a particularly fertile
area for low-budget pastimes.

Most students will probably get
their ﬁll of the Cathedral of
Learning classrooms before finally
leaving ‘Pitt’s hallowed halls.
Nonetheless, the Nationality Rooms
on the main ﬂoor are nationally
famous and warrant a complete
tour. You can guide yourself and
save the fee. _
Those with eclectic tastes and a

or bookworms, Pitt is a virtual breeding ground for your kind of entertainment,
offering the University’s own Hillman Library and, farther up Forbes Avenue,
Carnegie Library (above), which, as the building's inscription says, provides

rainy day on their hands can have a
ﬁeldday in Carnegie Museum. The
exhibits range from the natural to
the anthropological and are high-
lighted by an impressive display of
dinosaur skeletons.

The museum houses a respect-
able collection of art, modern and
classical, and is joined to the Scaife
Gallery, a new and tastefully
designed addition to the Pittsburgh
art scene. If you don’t mind sharing
the museum with others, you can
attend on a Saturday and stroll
through the entire complex free of
charge. A $1 donation is requested
on other days.

Carnegie Library, next to the
museum, offers a fairly large
collection of those easy-to-read
ﬁction works that can’t be found in
Pitt's Hillman Library. You can
either apply for a library card or
read your books a chapter at a time
in Camegie’s semi-quiet reading
rooms.

Nature lovers who are into
something more exotic than dande-
lions and squirrels will be more than
sated by the acres of ﬂora under
glass at Phipps Conservatory, just
across the bridge in Schenley Park.
Banana trees and cacti vie with
hundreds of more domestic shrubs
and ﬂowers for the visitor's

attention. Admission is free.

A bus ride to Highland Park
deposits one at the gates of the
Pittsburgh Zoo. The Main Zoo is an
old one, slated for extensive
renovation, and many of the
animals live in cramped quarters.
The variety of permanent residents
is extensive, however, with the
bears usually stealing the show.

The relatively new Aqua Zoo and
Underground Zoo are nicely
designed and informative. Admis-
sion is free on Saturdays only.

Those who prefer their wildlife in
the wild should head for Schenley
Park. The graded, wooded trails

No, this fella hasn’t been dipping into Schenley Pond, but you can catch his year-
round act at the Highland Park Zoo, where things can get hairier than in Oakland.

Panther Hollow are favored by
young lovers, masochistic joggers
and an occasional undesirable.

In warm weather, Flagstaff Hill,
across the road from Phipps
Conservatory, is usually populated
with sunbathers and frisbee en-
thusiasts.

One of Pittsburgh's legitimate
claims to fame as a scenic city is the
view of the downtown Golden
Triangle from the Mt. Washington
observation decks. If you’ve ever
seen a postcard of Pittsburgh, it
probably showed this view.

Growing Regioncils--A Promising Future Pm Time

(Continued from Pagevlll)

In that time, the Bradford campus
grew to accommodate 350 more
students, bringing the population to
750. “Bradford tries to develop an
atmosphere of friendliness between
the faculty and student body, based
on quality teaching,” Robinson
said. ‘ ‘The faculty is not committed
to publication or research; the
teaching load is heavy. Besides,

-there aren’t enough research or

library resources available. Scholar-
ship is not scorned here, but it
requires a lot of extra effort.”

As part of his committment to
teaching, Robinson conducts one
course per term. Campus President
Richard McDowell also teaches one
course per term.

By September 1977 the faculty
will expand to 40 full time
instructors, 32 of whom have PhDs.

“Classes are ordinarily small,”
said Robinson, “Lectures average
30 to 35 students, skills classes
average 20 to 25 students, and labs
have about 15 to 20 students.”

Bradford is a town of 15 to 20,000
people that was the country’s major
oil producing region around the turn
ofthe century. It is still productive
today.
crude oil is world-renowned for its
high paraﬁn content, which makes
it an excellent lubricant.

One-third of Bradford’s enroll-
ment is not referred there, but
consists of local residents interested
in courses speciﬁcally offered at the
campus.

Eight baccalaureate degrees are
offered by Bradford’s School of
General Studies including an
associate degree in petroleum
technology, which trains peop1e_to
work in the oil ﬁelds. ‘

“The number of local people

Bradford’s Pennsylvania_

enrolled here is expected to grow in
the coming years,” Robinson said.
“Bradford may look upon itself as
part of a major university, but it also
relates to the area. As far as
Pennsylvania is concerned, this is
an educationally deprived area.
The nearest campuses are Clarion,
Erie and Mansﬁeld. That's why
we’re locally oriented.

“We’re not running a perfect
system,” Robinson’ said, “but
we’re reﬁning all the time. “We’re
primarily looking out for the
student. The price of attending a
major university is having to deal
with a large bureaucracy, but a
large campus, like Oakland, has
many cultural advantages that a
small campus is unable to provide. ’ ’

Bradford’s petroleum technology
program, directed by Wilbert
Keder, is one of only ten such
programs in the nation. According
to Keder, Bradford’s program is
more academic than others, with
more math, physics, and engineer-
ing requirements.

‘ ‘These extra requirements. make
Bradford’s program appeal to
corporate recruiters, giving it an
edge over other schools’ pro-
grams,” Keder said.

“The two-year program at-
tracts recruiters from the three
major oil companies in town
(Kendall, Pennzoil, and Quaker
State) and independent producers
in the area. It is also starting to
attract recruiters from out of state.
Last year Shell Oil sent a
representative from Houston and he
plans to visit the campus again this
year,” Keder continued. ‘

Before teaching at Bradford,
Keder was a researcher in the
nuclear power industry». His
administrative duties and teaching

load don’t permit him to continue
his research activities as much as
he'd like to. “I visit Oakland’s
chemistry library and Carnegie
Library to read the current nuclear
chemistry abstracts,” he said.

Keder likes teaching at Bradford.
“There’s closer contact with
students,” he said. “They’re in
and out of my office every day and
they’re always welcome.

“I’d like to see a four-year
program in petroleum technology,
but I don’t think the idea is being
seriously considered,” Keder said,
“even though some of the other
schools are organizing four-year
programsﬁ’

A lot of the professional work
from regional campuses originates
from Johnstown, the oldest and
most established of the four.

The humanities division of
Johnstown’s English department
has five four-year programs:
English literature, creative writing,
theatre, communication, and a
program not offered at the main
campus, journalism.

According to Carol] Grimes,
director of the humanities division,
Johnstown has “very ﬁne teachers
plus ﬁne scholars. ’ ’ Five professors
in her division have received
National Endowment for the
Humanities awards to pursue
post-doctoral study at other institu-
tions. Another professor is on leave
in order to complete a novel.

“Because of the busy teaching
load, their professional work must
be conducted on the side,” Grimes
said.

The Greensburg campus just
completed a move last year,
centralizing the campus; it used to
have classroom space in a suburb
and downtown. It is now situated on

an estate outside of the Westmore-
land County city, and a science
building and student activities
center have just been completed.
There are no dormitories as yet, but
their construction is planned.

There are 950 full and part-time
students at Greensburg. CAS and
Engineering students relocate after
two years, but SGS offers four-year
degrees in business administration,
administration of justice and
various social sciences.

According to Norm Scanlon,
assistant to the academic clean, 40
percent of Greensburg’s students
are referred there by the main
campus. Because of its proximity to
Pittsburgh,_, some Oakland faculty
also teach regularly at Greensburg.

“The graduate education and
administration of justice courses
taught by Oakland faculty give
Greensburg an edge over other
regional campuses,” Scanlon said.

Larry Senor teaches chemistry at
Greensburg. “This is basically a
commuter school, with students
from local high schools. It's
informal, with smaller class size,”
he said. “It’s what I wanted. when
looking for a job.”

Senor received his PhD in
chemistry from the Oakland cam-
pus. “The main campus is much
more research oriented,” he said.

“There is time here to research, but
the activity is neitheriencouraged
nor discouraged. There are no
graduate students to do our
teaching out here—all courses are
taught by the regular faculty.”

“"1 like the atmosphere,” Senor
continued. “There is no ‘publish or
perish syndrome’ here.”

Titusville also offers the first two
years of CAS and engineering

(Continued on Page B 10)

Washington, you should spend 50
cents and take a ride down and back
up the Duquesne Incline. The angle
of descent is exhilarating and the
cars themselves are works of art.

A trip to Mt. Washington
requires a change of buses in
downtown Pittsburgh. The shops in

I .

town are not remarkable, but three ,

major department stores and a
cluster of establishments on Fifth
Avenue let one window-shop
without having to hike for miles.

Pittsburgh is one of the few
American cities which still uses
trolleys (or streetcars, if you prefer)
as an integral part of its mass transit
system. A jouncing, rattling ride
into the South Hills is an
inexpensive, fun (except at rush

hour) experience which will one day '_

be only history.

Point State Park, located at the
confluence of the city’s three rivers,
is pleasant, if not terribly exciting.
The mammoth fountain makes a trip
there worthwhile.

The above suggestions are
nowhere near exhaustive. The city
frequently offers free concerts,
usually classical, and free plays.
For schedules and lists of upcoming

events, check the Pitt News and the 4 L,

Pittsburgh New Sun. Both are free
and regularly distributed around
the campus. An excellent guide to
local activities, free and otherwise‘,
can be found in the Thursday
edition of the Pittsburgh Press.

 THE UNIVERSITY ORATORY  
or THE HOLY SPIRIT PARISH

  

THE ROMAN CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY PARISH of the Diocese of Pittsburgh was
created iI1 1967 to meet the special needs and aspirations of a seeking and learning com-
munity. Through worship, study, retreats and a wide program of other activities, the University
Oratory seeks to serve the students and faculty of the Oakland area. It is their Parish and repre-
sents their effort to build Christian Community.

A New Student’s Most Wanted List

For many Freshmen, the inaugural year at Pitt may be

nothin

91 more than a maze of faces and places that only add to

the confusion_of what to major in, where to meet friends and
0:3: to cope with _a disagreeable roommate. ‘
or that reason, the following has been compiled to

familiarize

you with some of the more commonplace per-

sonalities that crop up on campus from day to day.

Some administrate, some ent
solutely nothing. Nevertheless,
sometime during your stay at Pitt.

Fred Fonseca

Fred Fonseca
controls Pitt’s of- 
ﬁce of Residence _
Life. Your resi- p
dent assistant is
responsible to
him and, as long
as you live _in the
dorms, you are,
too. a
He can speed up a room’s
painting,’ﬁnd you a nicer roommate
or explain the wonders of coed
living. He can also have you thrown
from the 18th ﬂoor of Tower A if you
hurt one of his elevators.

 

Bob Marshall

Bob Marshall,
the College of
Arts and Sciences
clean, is the ad-
ministrator con-
cerned only with
the University’s
largest group of
students, those
full-time under- " _
graduates pursuing studies in CAS
disciplines.

Not your average administrator,
Marshall is a nice guy who always
seems to remember the students’
best interests and acts accordingly
whether dealing with policy revi-
sions or a student seeking help with
his self-designed major.

Marshall is distinguishable by his
Boston accent and his love of the
Red Sox. His always-open office is
on the Cathedral's ninth ﬂoor.

was made tougher recently by the
retirement of Tony Dorsett, Pitt’s
former Vice Chancellor for Running

Fast and Winning Heisman
Trophies.
Sherrill is new to the job,

replacing John Majors, who recent-
ly was called home to Tennessee.
Majors must present that state with
a national title in two years or spend
5-to-10 running from the blood-
hounds outside Tennessee’s maxi-
mum security prison.

Sherrill, whose specialties are

Cas Myslinski

Cas Myslinski,
an old West Point
buddy of Chan- 
cellor Wesley
Posvar’s, is Pitt’s
athletic director.

Myslinski has
had a few run-ins
with students—_-a
few years ago, the
Student Government called for his
resignation, claiming he lied about

 

a football tickets——and instituted the

policy of having students pay for
football tickets, but Pitt has been
doing an unusual amount of
winning while he has been here. He
has an awful lot of nice jewelry
courtesy of various football squads.

Curt Graham

Charles “Curt”
Graham is chief of
Pitt’s campus po-
lice department,
a squad that prob-
ably is larger than
your hometown
force, unless
you’re from Pitt-
sburgh or Phila-
delphia.

Graham, who worked his way up
from beat officer and detective, has
brought many fresh ideas concem-
ing police work to- the department,
but most of the squad’s actions
involve service functions—opening
locked buildings and reassuring
members of the Pitt community.

Many officers are trained to
handle medical emergencies. One
is a registered nurse. They'll
usually help if they can, but
remember they can do anything any
ofﬁcer caii—-—even arrest you-.

 

Bernie Payne

  
 
 
  
 
 
  
  

Samuel Ber-
nard Payne, who
goes by Bernie, is
president of Pitt’s
Student Govern-
ment Board, a
seven - member
organ elected by
undergraduates
e a c h W int e r
Term.

One thing SGB has done in recent
years was to introduce—and
continue—a food co-op designed to
provide students with cheap, good
vegetables and cheese.

It has worked, and most students
like it. Payne’s project has been the
acquisition of student buying cards

_ good for a 10 percent discount at

some area businesses. Don't expect
the world from SGB, but it tries and
usually has your best‘ interests
tucked somewhere in its suite of
offices.

is a man who attempts to keep both

A jovial man with a distinctive

Hughes works under Tom Alberts,

as Mini-Corporation for Running
Fast, Selling Rented Cars, Working
for ABC and Making a Million
Dollars.

Tony’s grades weren't record
breaking, but he didn’t want to
become a biochemist and he did
gain a lot besides yardage in his four
years here. His scholarship was the
best investment the University ever
made, and Pitt was the best thing
that happened to him.

Tony left Pitt memories of every
kind and much of his wardrobe is in
the Field House’s trophy cases. You
may see him in the off-season; he’ll
be in the long, sleek gray
Continental that has" a “Pitt is

Going Greek

The Choice is Up to You

By MARY S. HUZINEC

“When I was in high school I
heard bad things about fraterni-
ties, ’ ’ said Pitt senior Bruce Ungar.
“At freshman orientation I was
afraid to go to frat parties because I
thought the brothers would drag me
into a room and beat me up. I guess
I had an image of frat men in my
mind as guys who did weird things
all the time.” -

Amy Ansel thought sorority girls
were “stuck-up” before she came
to Pitt. “I never even considered
pledging,” she said.

‘ ‘I originally thought frat men did
nothing but sit around and party all
the time,” admitted George Nagle.

Currently, Ungar is a member of
Delta Sigma Phi fraternity, Ansel is

Why did these people “Go

who's merit has been often
criticized, from neighbors “com-

students who view frat members as
nothing more than beer-guzzlers
and trouble makers?

Like nearly 1,300 other Pitt
students, they eventually saw the
fraternities and sororities from a
different perspective. They looked
beyond hell week, hazings, parties,
and stereotypes and discovered
another side to the Greek system.

said Michele Gnora, a Delta Delta
Delta sister. “It’s a home away
from home,” she continued.
“We’re like a family.”

Some Greeks say they believe
problems arise from this “one-big-
happy-family” image.

“We’re brothers and we act like
brothers—arguments and all,”
admitted Pi Lambda Phi brother
Wayne Morris. "

Although frats have been criti-
cized for interfering with school-
work, members believe they have
advantages, too.

According to Morris, joining a
fraternity brings many guys “out”
socially. It gives them the
opportunity to come out of their
“shells.”

“A frat can help you scholastic-
ally too,” Morris said, “Often we
are stereotyped as being basket
‘weavers. Many guys in fraternities

- have the same majors. Sometimes
‘ brothers study together and help

each other with academic prob-

. lems.”

Commuting

The ‘Ups’ and ‘D

By RANDY GAYSEK

For you newcomers who plan to
breeze through your college careers
living on campus, in an off-campus
apartment or with your newfound
siblings in the fraternal and sororal
organizations, this orientation will
show you some of the craziness you
can expect in the fall.

If you (or more likely your
parents) decide, however, that you
would be better off staying at home
and commuting to school, enjoy
these few brief days while you can.
For commuters, school can seem
more like a nine-to-ﬁve job than a
learning experience...unless, of
course, you know how to do it right.

Admittedly, living on campus is
no thrill. Putting up with a
sickening roommate and eating the
more-so cafeteria chow isn’t exactly
thelife of Riley. Commuters, on the
other hand, have problems resi-
dents can’t even imagine.
Northsiders, for example, must get
up at least two hours before their
class if they use public transporta-
tion, and the Northside is one of the
more convenient places to live.

Life for the busing commuter
becomes a special threat when the
drivers decide to go on strike. And

you can park there all day for under

have to leave your car keys.

to it, like the charity and blood
drives.”

According to John Powers,
Interfraternity Council president
and Delta Phi brother, the Pitt
Greeks donated 950 pints of blood,
making them the largest donating
group in Pittsburgh last year. The
Greeks also raised $22,600 for the
American Cancer Society and
$15,000 for the Allegheny Valley
School for Exceptional Children.

“We’re the largest, most active
system on campus,” Powers stated.

“In the last Student Government
Board election, Greeks cast 1,100
out of the 2,000 total votes.”

Powers said he believed the
Greek system produces leaders.

you programming experience and
get you involved with the campus

some tips. First, the closer to your
class, the harder it will be to. get a
space. The meters lining Bigelow

Boulevard, Fifth Avenue and other 0

handy roads have one or two hour

time limits. If you feel lucky enough
to find a spot,‘ you should be
prepared to start each day with a
pocket load of change which is

certain to jingle as you walk out of
class early to feed the meter and
stave off a three dollar ticket from
the meter maids.

There are ways, however, to beat
the meters,(no, not with a hammer).
Many people are surprised to
discover that slugs, when and if
they can be found, save a lot of
money and are perfectly legal, as
long as you don’t get caught using
them. One Pitt veteran found
perfect, quarter-sized washers that
sold for ﬁve cents each at a
hardware store, but he never named
the store—-the crumb.

Deﬁning the Species

Commuting life is an art that can
be learned, but not very success-
fully taught. Observation of
experienced commuters imparts
more information than a textbook.

The best places to -observe

commuters are the Student Union
lobby, the recreation area, Burger
Chef, the Commons Room in the
Cathedral and any free event with
free refreshments. Commuters are
easy to pick out. Most carry a
canvas book bag which often
contains lunch. Commuters shoot
pool very well and many follow soap
operas religiously. Since their
social time is limited to short breaks
between classes, they are usually
friendly and outgoing and make
friends easily. Commuters will
make you feel at ease so feel free to
walk up to one and begin a
conversation. He will be more than
happy to share his knowledge on,
for example, the good spots to catch
a nap in Hillman library.

suited for parking, and when you do...

Student Union has a special room
for TV viewing. The color set is
practically new and generally the
programs viewed are decided upon
by democratic processes, except of
course when the soap openas 01' Sta!‘
Trek are on. These programs
override all other requests.

The Recreation Area. Enter the
Union on the Fifth Avenue side,
make a left and another left and you
ﬁnd some of Oakland’s most
challenging pinball, billiard and
ping pong tables. All are available
for a small fee when you present
your ﬂashy new ID card.

Art Exhibits. It seems there is
always an art exhibit somewhere on
campus whether it be in the Union,
the Frick Fine Arts building or the
UP Gallery on Forbes. Bring your
eyes, no cash is required.

Free Lectures. Did you know that
as a duly registered student of the

any class you like? You don’t get
grades or credit and it is generally
appreciated if you don’t cause any
commotion, but it is an interesting
way to improve yourself or kill 50
minutes.

For once, this looks like a pretty
good summer for movie fans.
Opening the season is a ﬂick that
promises to be the biggest
’money-maker of the year and a sure
Academy Award winner. Actually,
“Star Wars” is not the greatest
movie ever made, but it’s sure to
pack in summer crowds looking for
entertainment “the way they used

I to make ’em.”

“Star Wars” is pure comic book
stuff—but ﬂawless technically. It’s
a romantic-adventure-space fantasy
with the best collection of special

 

 

romantic triangle, derring-do, mon-
sters, spacecrafts, ancient religions
and all sorts of fun things;

The ﬂick is a combination of
“Flash Gordon,” “The Three
Musketeers,” and Laurel and
Hardy, plus a bunch of other easily
identiﬁable genres, all jumbled
together in a universe and time far
removed from our own.

The central character is Luke
Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a perfect
d’Artagnan of a country bumpkin
turned knight errant. He ﬁnds
himself on a quest to rescue the
Lovely Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher),
a rebel leader captured b the forces

(and that includes Stanley Kub-
rick’s overrated “2001 ’ ’). PG-rated,
it’s the sort of ﬁlm parents will ship
theirkids to and hopheads coast to
coast will see many times.

The plot. There’s one some-
where. It deals with the rebellion
against the powerful, evil Galactic
Empire, a comedy team of robots, a

 

of evil, after intercepting her
message to Ben Kenobi (Alec
Guiness). Kenobi, one of the last of
the Jedi knights, is a famous old
republic warrior. He becomes
mentor to young Luke, who seeks to
learn the ways of the Force.

Walk and Kingpitcher Gallery are
just two of the many Oakland
establishments where top-rate art is
available for viewing and buying.

With the Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre, the Pitt Studio Theatre,
the 99 Cent Floating Theatre,
Allegheny Community Theatre, the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre and
productions at Heinz Hall—not to
mention repertory companies such
as the Theatre Express—there are
enough plays to keep almost any
Broadway addict occupied and
entertained.

near a complete gaze at what’s
available to you—Jazz Weekend,
the Fall Flower Show, the

New Doonesbury Letdown

An Especially Tricky People
By G. B. Trudeau
Holt, Rineholt and Winston

At long last, another Doonesbury
book is on the market. Unfortun-
ately, expectations outweigh the
outcome and “An Especially Tricky
People” does not measure up to its
predecessors. '

The major part of the book deals
with Uncle Duke (the cartoon
extension of gonzo journalist
Hunter Thompson) who ‘is appoint-
ed top envoy to China and meets up
with a senile Chairman Mao, who
insists Duke is David Eisenhower.
Except for the mistaken identity and
a run-in with a tricky translator, this
section is rather dull.

On the plus side, Ginny _Slade
decides to run for Congress.
Enlisting the aid of Joanie Caucus,
Zonker Harris and her “main
man” Clyde (who makes for the
book’s best» moments when he
canvasses voters) as well as rock
super star Jimmy Thudpucker, she
manages a mere four percent of the
vote.

There are also some good laughs
via the Patty Hearst trial, Governor

 

  

Jerry Brown’s campaign, and a
teaser at the end about the fourth
annual Watergate conspirators’
reunion. That’s all too brief.

Author Garry Trudeau hasn’t lost
his touch—it’s just that overt
attempts to be trendy are disruptive
to the ﬂow of humor. Trudeau
would do well to look into the roots

of “Doonesbury” and put it back in
its campus-based perspective. It’s
- getting hard to keep track of the

growing list of characters and J

harder still to care about them.

Possibly, Trudeau could split the
strip in two factions-one dealing
with current newsitems and the
other with his Yale-based original
cast.

Jail In Store For
Stones’ Richard?

By PETE DICKS

The legal ideal of ‘ ‘innocent until
proven guilty” is frequently put to
the test during. criminal trials

surrounded by great publicity, and

it seems that Rolling Stones
guitarist Keith Richard will have to
overcome extreme odds to get a fair
trial June 27 as a result of his
February 27 Canadian drug arrest.

Richard, in Toronto to perform
two unannounced club dates at El

 

Mocambo Tavern to provide
additional material for a soon—to-be-
released Rolling Stones “1ive”
double album, was charged with
heroin possession with intent to
traffic and possession of one-ﬁfth of
an ounce of cocaine. Royal
Canadian Mounted Police found
one ounce of heroin allegedly
belonging to Richard, while search-
ing the band’s hotel rooms a few
days before their concerts.

Rolling Stones May Be Without Richard

(Continued from Page 4)

A number of sources claim that
Canadian authorities unjustly
charge many alleged drug violators
with “intent to trafﬁc,” a very
serious offense, rather than mere
possession, the more likely viola-
tion. One must certainly question
the idea that Keith Richard,
member of “the world’s greatest
rock ’n’ roll band,” with his high
income, is a trafficker of drugs in
any quantity, let alone one ounce.

Word that the Canadian govern-
ment will seek the full penalty
against Richard has sent shivers
through the bodies of not only
Richard and the rest of the Stones,
but through millions of music fans
throughout the world.

A trafficking conviction carries
the penalty of imprisonment of
seven years to life—a heavy price

“Star Wars”

when one considers the millions of
fans who gain pure positive
enjoyment from the Rolling Stones’
music.

Mick Jagger may be the visual
focal point on stage, but Keith
Richard is the musical heart of the
Rolling Stones. Philosophically,
too, he is the center. Keith Richard
has always embodied every element
of rock ’n’ roll, more so than anyone
else except perhaps the late Stone
guitarist Brian Jones.

Richard’s embodiment of the
music is important even today,
since rock music has been the
uniting force of a whole generation.

Keith Richard has never overtly
advocated the use of drugs; in fact,
Jagger and Richard over 10 years
ago wrote a song “Mother’s Little
Helper, ” describing the problem of

‘prescription-drug abuse among

housewives.

By shunning the jet set crowd and
all its trappings, Richard has
avoided the media and publicity,
but the persecution persists. One
company has advertised bumper
stickers reading “Free Keith
Richard,” despite the fact that he
has not been put on trial. Much talk
seems to speculate about how long
the 33-year-old guitarist “will” be
in jail, completely ignoring the
notion of “innocent until proven
guilty.”

So let it be said: “Free Keith
Richard” indeed, not from jail, but
from persecution in his private life
by the media and authorities. First
and foremost, we should concern
ourselves with his music. All that

matters is Keith Richard in his role.

as guitarist for the Rolling Stones,
and without Keith Richard, there
would be no Rolling Stones, and
without the Rolling Stones...

Flicks Are Getting Better

(Continued from Page 4)

In their efforts for peace and
justice, Luke and Kenobi team up
with a pirate mercenary, Han Solo
(Harrison Ford) and his ﬁrst mate
Chewbacca, a Wookiee (“a race of
tall anthropoids with quasi-monkey
faces and large blue eyes”). They
encounter the Empire's - most
awesome ‘weapon—-a planet-sized
spaceship with the capacity to
destroy an entire planet in one shot.
Well, there’s a lot of excitement, '
some sparring with the, head
villains—the evil governor of the
Imperial Outland regions (Peter
Cushing) and the malevolent Dark

Lordof the Sith. Darth Vader (David ‘

Prowse), a traitor to the Jedi

knights: This leads to a big,
slam-bang ﬁnish. Don't worry,
fans———the story isn't over yet, and
director George Lucas is already at
work on a sequel.

The ﬂick’s two best characters T

are Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2) and
See-Threepio (C-3P0), the Laurel‘
and Hardy of the heavy-metal set.
This pair of robots (actually Kenny
Baker and Anthony Daniels)‘
provide most of the comic
relief—besides being essential to
the story line—and are much more
believable than. most of the
humanoids.

That's the only problem .with
“Star Wars. ’ ’ The dialogue is often R
ridiculously bad, the story is

sociologically inept (talk, about g

sexism——-there seems to be only one

woman in the entire universe) and
the characters are slightly more
shallow than those in the average
comic book.

Who cares?

‘There's a lot of action, more than
100 separate special effects (many
as the result of technological
advances made since “2001”), and

more than enough excitement to fill‘

the screen for two hours. The
camera work and editing, oouldn‘t
be better. “Star Wars”,is just fun,
with no redeeming social value
(unlike the pompous “200l”) and a
sure winner.

_ Starland Vocal Band

Windsong Records

Last summer, the career of the
Starland Vocal Band, a Washington
D.C.-based foursome, took off with
a hit record called “Afternoon
Delight.” And then the blitzkrieg
set in.

Group founders (and husband.

and wife) Bill and Taffy Danoff have
enjoyed a bit of ‘a gloriﬁed
reputation since they helped write
John Denver's “Take Me Home,
Countrv Roads.” Now, writers
from “People” magazine are
comparing the group to the Mamas
and the Papas (their sole resem-
blance is the fact that both bands
are quartets), they’ll be hosting a
summer variety hour (a la Sonny
and Cher and the Captain and
Tenille), and, yes folks, this is the
group that beat out Boston at the
Grammys. So what?

While “Rear View Mirror” is a
better effort than “Afternoon
Delight,” almost anything would
be. The vocalizing is fine
(especially Taffy Danoff’s—she
sounds like a disciplined Joni
Mitchell), the music is soft and

subtle. But it’s boringly similar and ,

the lyrics are generally inane. _ 
Take the title track, for instance.
Though easily the best effort on the

511+ AVE.

is coming!

album, the refrain—”...I see my
life in your rear view mirror, But I
don’t see heaven, And I don’t see
heaven getting any nearer...”—is a
prime example of the gushing
sentimentality that buries any
promise this album ever had.

In fact, most of the songs are
about traveling or the sea and it’s
enough to put you to sleep.

“St. Croix Silent Night” might
have been a good single but it too is
ruined by moronic lyrics.

Iveﬂcume

The Starland Vocal Band fares
best when they stay away from
country-western leanings. Two
songs, “Norfolk” and “Don't Stay
Forever,” were written by country

singer Emmylou Harris. Along with
the Denoffs’ twangy “Liberated
Woman,” they are the worst tracks
on the album.

What the Starlanders need is
better material and to overcome the
neurotic compulsion to emulate
third-rate Denver material.

“Star Wars” and “Annie Hall”

  They ’re Making ‘Em Like they Used To 

(Continued from Page 

Another excellent ﬂick is Woody
Allen’s “Annie Hall,” a love story
suffused with comedy. Allen and
Diane Keaton are again a pair of
advanced neurotic lovers in a story
more than slightly autobiographi-
ca .

Allen plays a comedy writer-
turned comedian-turned play-
wright, who after a couple of
unfortunate marriages, becomes
involved with a singing hopeful
(Keaton). Together they work out
their analysis. The movie, via

stream of consciousness, depicts
the affair and Allen’s life and times.

Chewbacca, the wookie, is at the controls as he and Luke Skywalker (Mark
Hamill) and Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness) come closer to the Death Star in this

scene from “Star Wars.’’

A--

Unlike previous ﬂicks, Allen
makes no great social statement.
Although he still has a lot of things
to say, Allen is more concerned with
creating an offbeat romance. His
character is a little more believable,
terribly insecure but not totally a
jerk. The women are more realistic,
as well, unlike the great uncaring
emasculators he usually includes in
his ﬁlms.

The core of the ﬁlm, however, is
the comedy. Most of it comes to the
audience in a series of asides (like
Eugene O’Neill or Groucho Marx),
although they get comically com-
plex in a fantasy structure. An
exchange in a theatre queue is one
of the biggest laughs of the movie,
as well as wish fulﬁllment for»
frustrated intellectuals everywhere.

There is less visual humor than in
Allen’s earlier ﬁlms, but just
enough slapstick to provide some
horselaughs. Mainly, the humor is
found in the gap between what is
said and what is meant.

“Annie Hall” is a bittersweet
romance (Allen would cringe at that

line) about two people who grow
together, and just as naturally grow
apart. He works to transform Annie
until she is ready to move on,
something he can’t quite accept
even after it’s all over (the ending is
particularly touching).

(or even if it extends that far), Allen
manages to get in some digs on Los
Angeles and the whole California
bit. If there’s a social commerlii
anywhere, it’s there. _
“Annie Hall” has lots of good
comedy—which is expected from
a Woody Allen ﬁlm—-and not so
much punch, making a ﬂick a lot of
people can enjoy. And laugh with.

Folk Festival
A Dose Of Culture

By MREA CSORBA

Pittsburgh got a dose of culture
last weekend it won't soon forget.
The folk festival swung through the
Civic Arena last Friday, Saturday
and Sunday nights, brought to you
and performed by your friends and
neighbors——the Pittsburgh ethnic
community.

They danced with zest, cooked
with ﬂavor and revealed more about
their cultures than how to look
pretty in national costumes.

The best dancing was exuberant
and thigh-slapping. The best music
was loud and spirited. And the most
appealing - costumes were fully
masculine—complete with linen

7 blousons and spurred leather»
3 boots-—-or folksily feminine—gath- -

ered, embroidered skirts with lots of
ruffles. The Bulgarians, Hungar-
ians and Latvians -carried the show
splendidly with these European
elements.

Clicking maracas, they pranced and
swayed to the deep southern music.

The Indians’ stage performance
and free-for-all dancing, however,
stole the show, which is not
unusual. Yearly they put on a
splendid show with exotic sitar
music, colorful silk saris and zabbas
and a well-coordinated light show.
And beneath the surface glitter, the
dancers move with subtlety and
grace. 3

who played the role of creator and in
four years built a football team that
completed a season in dynamic
fashion.

Beginning with a 31-10 win over
Notre Dame, the Panthers claimed
victory in 12 consecutive contests en
route to a number one national
ranking and a Heisman Trophy
award for running back Tony
Dorsett, the country’s top collegiate
football talent.

Dorsett, a product of nearby
Hopewell High, netted a record-
setting 6,082 yards for career
rushing before being drafted into
the pro ranks by the Dallas
Cowboys.

The' Panthers capped their

‘undefeated season with a 27-3

victory over Georgia in New

‘ Orleans’ Sugar Bowl on January 1,

giving Pitt fans from Forbes Avenue
to Bourbon Street something more
to toast than a new year.

Students returning here for
Winter Term carried the festive
spirit into January, with nothing on
their minds but New Year’s parties
and the just-completed_ football
season. Final exams were three
months away and many students
skipped class to avoid temperatures
that tumbled to . record lows.
University classes were cancelled,
for the first time in decades, to
comply with a state of emergency
declared by Governor Milton

, Shapp. With everything freezing

over, including classes, it appeared
that 1977 would not be an ordinary
year.

On January 20, Pitt suffered its
in recent
memory. An explosion rocked a
wing of Langley Hall, on Tennyson
Avenue, leveling two lecture rooms
in the building, one of which
contained more than 100 students.
A secretary and student were killed
and scores were rushed to area
hospitals, including several ﬁreman
who had inhaled highly toxic gases.

Officials searched almost a month
for the explosion’s cause before

concluding that natural gas acciden-
tally triggered the blast.

Although the explosion domin-
ated headlines for several weeks,
Professor Paul Nyden’s pursuit for
reappointment has lingered on the
front page since last April, when he
was denied a three-year contract
renewal by Pitt’s sociology depart-
ment. ~

Nyden, a Marxist, claimed
politics spurred the department’s
decision; the department held that
he lacked teaching ability and
proficient scholarly works.

Along with a small group of
student supporters, including his
wife, Linda, Nyden pressured the
administration to overturn the
department’s decision, exhausting
all internal appeals channels
available and surrounding himself
with controversy.

"Nyden’s supporters have staged
several protests since last April,
including an interruption of a Board
of Trustees meeting in January.
Black militant Angela Davis spoke
at Pitt on his behalf in March, and

later that month about 60 Nyden
supporters occupied the office of ’

Chancellor Wesley Posvar before
being dealt a court injunction.
After undergoing several re-
views, the Nyden case was
forwarded to Posvar for a final
decisionin April. Posvar granted
the sociologist a 15-month rein-
statement that Nyden accepted
“under protest,” listing‘ seven
pages of conditions to be met by the
University. Pitt lawyers, after
receiving Nyden’s reply, deter-
mined his conditions did not legally

constitute an acceptance and the

University revoked its contract
offer. Nyden maintains he will
attempt to resolve the issue through-
internal channels, but will go to
court if he must.

Under the University’s contract,
Nyden was removed from the
sociology department in all but title
and was to receive his teaching
assignments from Faculty of Arts

and Sciences Dean Jerome Rosen-
berg; Nyden reportedly fell into
disfavor with a number of his
colleagues during his fight for
reappointment.

Rosenberg, who would have been
the chief evaluator of Nyden’s
future work, was embroiled in
controversy over the dismissal of
another Pitt faculty member, Yusef
Ali, late of the black studies
department. Rosenberg earlier this
year reversed a decision by that
department to give Ali a renewed
contract, prompting Ali to speak out
harshly against what he termed the
administration’s racist policies and
against Rosenberg in particular.

fresh milk. And two organizations
——the Greeks and the Student
Government Board (SGB)—also
shouldered attacks in the past year.

In September, the neighbors of
Pitt’s off-campus fraternities
charged the frats with excessive
noise during rush parties and
urination in public, among other
complaints.

Meanwhile, the SGB, the repres-
entative body of undergraduates,
experienced internal and external
woes. Disagreement between the
board and two of its standing
committees in November resulted
in the cancellation of a rock concert
during Homecoming Week and a

Langley Hall’s auditorium wing was levelled and two persons were killed by
a natural gas explosion. 

Rosenberg’s decision was subse-
quently upheld, and Ali, who joined
Nyden in fighting for their jobs this
year, was dismissed from Pitt in
May after teaching for seven years.

While the administration should-
ered most of the controversy, two
faculty members debated, pointed
at times, the effects of a September
nuclear test on mainland China on

waste of $2,500 in student activity
fees.

A couple weeks later, more than
150 members of the Black Action
Society (BAS) disrupted a board
meeting and prohibited several
persons from leaving the crammed
Student Government offices. BAS
members demanded quick institu-
tion of proposals supporting blacks

and called for the resignation of
SGB President Barry Weisband.

But the Weisband 
managed to implement some
successful programs in 1976-77,
such as a food co-op oﬁering fresh
produce at reduced prices. And
when a strike by Port Authority
Transit employes crippled Alle~
gheny County in December, a
carpool coordinated by the SGB and
Carnegie-Mellon University gave
some 1,300 commuters alternative
transportation.

Another strike, this one more
immediate, affected Pitt when most
campus policemen walked off their
jobs in November, forcing campus
residence groups to tighten security
for several days, until the cops
returned to work after accepting the
University’s contract proposals.

While strikes, protests and the

Before last basketball season’s
initial dribble, ‘Pitt  Tim
Grgurich--the young, 
successor to_ Bun Ridl, who retired
two years ago after guiding a losing
program to two post-season tourna-
ments-’-was excited about his team.
He thought-and said-the team
-would be very good: the football
team nay not be the 
Panther squad in the national Top
20, Grgurich hinted.

Aﬁer the first few dribbles-make
that double-dribbles, bad passes,
defensive disasters and unwise
shots--he saw his team execute,
Grgurich had to regret those
remarks more than he regretted not
signing Phil Hubbard several
springs ago.

Though
Cincinnatti at the Field House on a
last-second corner shot by Larry
Harris, being walloped by several
members of the Top 20 was as close
as Pitt got to the Top 20. Or even
Top 100.

The record at season’s end was
6-21. The team managed fewer
wins in a 27-game schedule than the
football squad took in its ﬁrst seven
games.

Though the season was just as bad
asthe record indicates, it was not a
completely wasted year. Freshman
Mike Rice, a6-Bforwardwith a nice

ball, showed he was a dependable
major-college player when healthy.
He was the team leader in
rebounding with an eight-per-game
average, and usually scored in
double ﬁqures.

At times, he was the only player
under the boards, however, and
often was the only thing standing
between ﬁve opponents and the
basket.

Lewis of Schenley High, showed
bursts of absolute brilliance though
playing out of position at guard.
When roaming free, he was
fantastic--a favorite\ (and difficult)
play was to stay in front of a guard
bringing the ball upcourt, wait for a
pass to be thrown apparently out of
hisreach, leap to intercept, smile at
the stunned opponent and take both
ball and defender to the hoop for a
smashing dunk.

But Lewis, whose main problems
appear to be maintaining a good
attitude and dodging low-ﬂying
airliners, is no good to anyone 30
feet from the basket, and that is
where he spent most of last season.
There, and on the bench for
disciplinary reasons.

Larry Harris, a smooth, strong
6-6 shooting forward, spent his
junior year scoring 22.9 points per
game and attempting to fill the role
of team leader. A spectacular
player capable of controlling a game
when he desires to do so, Harris
suffered a mouth injury after being
tripped up during an early-season
dunk attempt and spent a good part
of the year recovering his aggres-
siveness.

The pro scouts may be enough
motivation this year for Harris, who
could be a great player with a good
team.

Other Panthers--shooter Scott
Nedrow, dribbler Pete Strickland,
6-11 Ed Scheuermann--turned in
good efforts at times, but the player
who got the most out of the year was
6-5 guard-forward Terry Knight,
who took a red-shirt after pre-sea-
son knee surgery. He’ll return as a
junior, and since Grgurich appar-
ently will make use of taller guards
next season, could make a
substantial contribution.

Pitt and higher ranking, it was
defeated by someone else. And no
man will again combine good
fortune and great talent as did Tony
Dorsett last season.

For two years, Dorsett amassed
amazing yardage totals by playing
the major part in what was
essentially a one-man offense on a
fair-to-good team. His teammates
were good enough to get him in the
secondary, but not talented enough
to get there themselves. Hence, no
one complained when his 200-yard
games were the result of ball-

hogging.

In Dorsett’s third year, the team -
was markedly better--Majors’ first ‘

recruits were upperclassmen--and
though he had to share the ball with
» Eliot Walker, there‘ was still enough
yardage for him to stay on the
6,000-yard track. V --

In his senior season, Dorsett was
the subject of a media hype rarely
matched. ABC promoted him as the
Farrah Fawcett-Majors of sports;
Sports Illustrated pictured him in a
Superman outfit. His name was
everywhere, and he was engaged in
a tight race with Ricky Bell for the
Heisman. , 1

Clearly, it was no time to let cries
of “ball-hog” tarnish his image
with the Heisman voters. But how

was Tony to get the ball as many I

timeslas he needed to accomplish

the goals his followers had set for

him? .

That problem was solved when
Pitt--which went into the season
with two excellent quarterbacks,
Bob Haygood and Matt
Cavanaugh--found itself with none
several games into the season.

For the team, it was potential

ﬂier Year of ?  

to show greatest improvement over
the summer. ‘

He has a nice touch for a big man,
but was outweighed by some
cheerleaders last winter. A special
weight program may take care of
that.

With the returning players,
including several battle-tested un-
derclassmen, and a crop of recruits
that figures to yield two usable
performers, Pitt may sport a
basketball team worth saving some
cheers for.

But don’t expect to hear that from -
Tim Grgurich. If he’s smart he’ll
contain his enthusiasm and spend
October forecasting doom.

disaster, since a loss would give
Michigan a chance to forever crush
the Panthers’ bid for the top.

But for Dorsett, it was unbeliev-
B L E
ble luck. Now he could carry the ball
50 times each game and his appetite
for handoffs and pitches would not
be questioned. In fact, his stamina
was an asset and his many charges
into and around the lines were
sacriﬁce for the good of the team.

They also were the perfect means
of clinching the Heisman and giving
Pitt the following it needed to hold
off challengers and ride all the way
to the Sugar and MacArthu rBowls.

It was a great time for Pitt;
though Christmas was past, it
seemed everyone connected with
the Pitt program got what he
desired after the season.

The fans could wear “Pitt” on
jackets and caps again, and could
brag as could no others.

The players had their national
championship rings-, and the
coincidental amenities. ‘ I

John Majors had a invitation to
return home, where he’ll learn to
live with a milder press and a
ravenous crowd of 9-and-2-isn’t-
good-enough fans.

The students had the rare luxury of

screaming, ‘ ‘We’re number one” at
football games, knowing it was so.

The University was back from the '

dark days of the '60s; it was as
big-time as it could get. lt’s
amazing how many facets of a
school are polished, at least in the
public eye, by a fantastically
successful football season and the
resultant publicity.

Tony Dorsett had his Heisman
and his million-dollar contract.
Grown men worried about whether
he liked them enough to play for
them.

And Jackie Sherrill had, by

following that has become accust-

intercollegiate football.

Some Pitt players are talking
about staying on top; pre-season
polls put them in the top 10 and one
had them number four. They are
not in as good a position to attack
the top spot as they were a year ago,
but should play some exciting aerial
football.

Revolts, Suspensions Fail
To Rattle Smooth lcers

By JIM PANE

Despite being hampered by a
number of problems, the 1976-77
Pitt Hockey Club emerged with yet
another winning season.

Player revolts and suspensions,
members quitting the team for one
reason or another and the
ever-present setback of University
funding (or lack thereof) apparently
failed to rattle the Panthers as they
amassed a very presentable 12-5-1
record against tough competition.

The successful campaign boost-
ed head coach Len Barcalow’s
record to 59-17-5 in his four years
with Pitt, which has not exper-
ienced a losing season in its

_ six-year history.

campaign, led Pm In scoring last year, canning 22.9 points per game tor the 6-

The season debut at the Civic
Arena saw the Panthers clip
Carnegie-Mellon. 12-2, but ~ an

incident following the next game
proved to be the beginning of
Barcalow’s headaches. After Pitt

overcame 4-0 and 7-4 deﬁcits to tie

Penn State, 8-8, on a last-minute
goal by captain Rick Vernon,
Barcalow and faculty advisor
Harvey Wolfe suspended Vernon
and teammate Scott Kimmick for
what Barcalow called “insubor-
dination.”

“They’re suspended indeﬁnite-
ly.” Barcalow explained after the
run-in. “and I don’t remember
dates too well.”

The team surrendered a mighty
scoring duo with the loss of Vernon
and Kimmick, who last year
contributed a combined 71 points to
the Panther cause. Kimmick
tallied 16 goals and 20 assists for 36
points and Vernon (26-9-35) was
Pitt’s all—time scoring leader with
138 goals and 83 assists during an
abbreviated four-year career.

Their absence was hardly
missed. however, as Barcalow’s
“new look” Panthers followed with
an 11-0 whitewash of Cleveland
State and continued their winning
ways to conclude a respectable
season.

“Wc’ve made some changes.”
Barcalow said after the Cleveland
game. “We have some discipline
now. a new morale. and a new
look."

AgostineIIa’s Conﬁdence
Squad Growing Yearly  

ByJIM LEWIS

As the young Pitt track team’s
experience grows so does head
coach Mike Agostinella’s conﬁ-
dence in his squad.

‘ ‘I'm pretty conﬁdent of the kids’
ability, ’ ’ he declared. ‘ ‘This team’s
growing up year after year.”

With the loss of Bill Shirley, Terry
Wile, and Willie Walker, you might
think success was a bit out of reach.
But recruiting has been good to
Agostinella this summer and able
bodies have been found to replace
lost talent. '

In the running events, a nucleus
of five fine performers are
reportedly ‘coming to Pitt, namely
Mount Lebanon sprinter Greg
Connover, high hurdler _=David
Henson of Delaware," ‘half-miler
Willis Shannon of New Jersey, relay
runner Jack Cabe of Norwin and
Indiana University of Terre‘ Haute
transfer BudMorris. \

In the field events, pole vaulter
Gene Roach of Trinity, high jumper
Lee Kirby of Fox Chapel and shot
putter Leon Milnes of Shenango
head the list‘, with more- new faces
expected to join in the form of
walk-ons.

Successful Netters
Ignore Records,
Enjoy Competition

By JIM PANE

Pantherette tennis coach Nancy
Gordon isn’t impressed with
records and statistics. After her
1976-77 team ‘completed a 6-5
season, equaling the mark it set a
year ago, Gordon didn't grieve over
the ﬁve losses.

‘ ‘Records don’t mean anything to
me,” claimed the second-year
coach. “We played well against a
tough schedule and beat the teams I
thought we’d beat.”

All of Pitt’s victories came in a
ﬁve-week fall season; the Panther-
ette performed at a 6-3 clip. Two
losses in an abbreviated spring
schedule rounded out the year.

Despite the ﬁve setbacks, there is
some consolation in knowing who

A dealt the blows. - Losses against

such powers as Michigan State,
Maryland, Penn and Penn State are
nothing to be ashamed about and
Gordon agrees.

“The only thing that bothers me
is when we lose to teams we
shouldn’t,” she said.

The Pantherette cause was led by.
the undefeated doubles duo of
Maris Paris and Janet DeCostro.
Paris, a sophomore, coasted to a 9-2
singles record while DeCostro
ﬁnished with a 10-1 slate.
DeCostro, undefeated until her ﬁnal
match against Penn State, was.
hailed by her teammates when she
was voted MVP in only her
freshman year.

Paris and DeCostro also partici-
pated
competition. Pitt sent four
representatives there and ﬁnished
sixth in a ﬁeld of 43 teams.

A stunning victory for Pitt tennis
occurred in February when the men
and women netters combined to
capture the annual Saranac Cup
Invitational, beating Maryland and
two-time Saranac winner Ohio
State. Pitt not only won but
sparkled, emerging undefeated in
the World Team tennis-like event.

Gordon expects the 1977-78
schedule to limit spring matches
because of bad weather, but it will
includeanexpanded fallislate.

Panther wrestling coach Dave
Adams discussed the team's last
season performance and what Pitt
fans could expect in 1977-78.

Pitt got off to a fast start last
season by winning its ﬁrst ﬁve
matches, and was ranked 18th
nationally before running into
trouble in the middle part of the
season.

The 1976-77 team did manage a
6-6 record and a third place ﬁnish in
the Eastern Wrestling League
(EWL) that includes Lock Haven
(Pa.), Bloomsburg State (Pa.), Penn
State, Clarion State (Pa;) and the

_ University of Buffalo.

f “Injuries were our”,-biggest

“We had to use ‘a majority of
inexperienced guys in our line-up. "’

On the positive side Adams’ said,
‘ff=I‘_he~ most encouraging thing was

that we had eight freshmen who

gained experience.”‘
The Panthers lost only one ‘senior

year. a . P .

Women Win Amp-Iy

By JOHN FINN

Although the energy crisis was
responsible for the cancelation of a
women's swim meet last January,
there was no evidence of an energy
crisis among this year’s Panther-
ette swimmers.

All-America Kathy Stetler led a
group of highly talented swimmers
to a 5-1 dual meet record for the
1976-77 season. In addition. the
Pantherettes captured their own
invitational relay meet and placed
third in a ﬁeld of 44 teams at the
Eastern Championships.

Individually. Stetler the
team leader in and out of the
water—sne served as team captain
and let her swimming do the

W35

talking. For the second consecu-
tive year. Stetler earned all-Amer-
ica status; this year it was for her
performance in the 50-yard butter-
ﬂy and the 100-yard freestyle.

The 800-yard freestyle relay with
Christy Elston. Jamie Conley,
Jennifer Price and Stetler missed
gaining all-America status by two
places. In diving. Linda Hamner
qualified for Nationals after an
outstanding performance in the
one-meter diving competition at
the Eastern Championships. Diane
Kluglien and Sue Guyer also
qualified for Nationals.

The Pantherettes’ only loss (by

two points) came at the hands of

Priiiceton. and Pitt scored impres-
sive victories over Slipoerv Rock.

Booters Hope to Score

Against Powerful Foes

By TOM FISHER

Pitt soccer coach Leo Bemis cited
several factors in the team's 1976
performance and looked ahead
optimistically to the 1977 season.

While crediting his squad’s
defense. Bemis pointed out the lack
of an offensive scoring punch.

“We scored only 10 goals during
the season. and I considered it a
minor miracle that we won four
games and tied two." Bemis said.

' Noting the number of youths on
the '76 team. he said. “The team
was predominantly freshmen and
sophomores who came out of the
season with experience and matur-
ity.”

Injuries to key’ personnel and a
tough schedule also ﬁgured in the
team's 1976 slate of 4-7-2.

Bemis also acknowledged the
loss of the junior varsity program
and its importance to the Pitt
soccer program.

“The junior varsity program was
phased out last year.” Bemis
explained» “I was running two
programs on one budget. The
junior varsity was meaningful
because it gave incentive to players
to play soccer who at first did not
make varsity."

Bemis said that the high point of
the season was a 0-0 tie against
Penn State. the NCAA Division 1
pick.

Bemis listed several things
which could improve the team next
season. Some ground was gained
in the off-season by virtue of last
winter's indoor soccer season.
Bemis stated.

“We played in seven tourna-

merits." he said. “We won the
Grove City tournament, and beat

_two teams that beat us in the

regular season. You can’t stagnate
your program."

Recruiting many high quality
freshmen was also sited as helping
the soccer team.

“We have (good freshmen
coming in. Two received all-state
recognition and a third one was the
leading scorer in the Philadelphia
public school system. It is also our
largest freshman crop (18).” Bemis
said. I

“We recruited very hard,” he
added.

Increased attendance at home
matches was a third point that
Bemis touched on.

“We had pretty good attendance
last season. On Friday nights.
many area high’ school soccer
players came to our home matches
and liked what they saw. It helped
our recruiting effort.” Bemis
explained.

Bemis is encouraged by the fact
that 30 non-student season tickets
(student admission is free) have
already been sold. He hopes to sell
100 this season.

Yet Bemis admits that lie is
primarily interested in the student
market. I

“We have to get the student
population in attendance to receive
recognition by the University
administration." Bemis com-
mented.

The 1977 home schedule in-
cludes quality teams like Akron.
Temple. Slippery Rock (Pa.).
Bucknell. Grove City (Pa.) and
Ediiiboro (Pa.).

Pitt head coach Kate Mathison
said she believes the Pantherettes
will be stronger this season after a
ﬁne recruiting year and the return
of a number of letter winners.

In addition to Hamner. Connie
Heister. Jenny Brooker and Cindy
Ferraro will return to bolster the
strength of the diving team. Sandy
Moran. Nila De Jesus. Debbie
Schloder. Judy Heretick and Lisa
Jarvis will come back to solid
nucleus of swimmers.

Swimming is a year-round sport,
and most of the Pantherettes are
already working hard in prepara-
tion for next season. With a
powerful group of swimmers
returning. the women’s swim team
is another of the women’s athletic
teams with a shot at a national
championship.

Field Hockey At
Home In Pitt’s

Winning Tradition ’

Women’s ﬁeld hockey has found
a home on the Pitt campus. Under
the leadership of head coach Janet
McDowell, the Pantherettes com-
piled a surprising 4-4 record in the
rookie season of Pitt’s newest
sport.

Teams in any sport have
difficulty predicting what an
upcoming season will provide but
the Pitt athletic department could
not even guess who its players

2 would be until school started last

fall. The Pantherette squad grew
through poster advertisements and
word of mouth until McDowell
found herself with a 20-girl team
(which was later reduced to 13
because of injuries and illness.) in
time for her first game in late
September.

Pitt surfaced with ‘five exper-
ienced performers—eventual lead-
ing scorer Cindy DiGiacomo, goalie
Robin Brust. Lisa Eppenhimer. Sue
Swick and Meg Stanger—and a
crop of enthusiastic beginners who
engulfed on an uncertain cam-
paign. which ended in a respect-
able manner against experienced
opponents.

“The kids did super well for not
playing before." McDowell pro-
claimed. “It's pretty tough playing
with maybe two experienced girls
on the forward line.”

Nothing to“ be ashamed of.
though—a .500 record against high

Water Polo: Pitt’s New
Unknown Claim to Fame

ByJIMPANE

Everyone and his brother knows
of the success of Tony Dorsett and
company but has anyone heard of
the athletic department's latest
claim to fame? It's none other than
the men’s water polo team which
came mighty close to enabling Pitt
rooters to boast of two national
champions in one year.

\In only its third year of exitence
and first as an "‘unofﬁcia1” varsity
sport, the poloists glide to a 19-3
record (17-0 in Mid-Atlantic Con-
ference play)—good enough for
best in the East and eighth on the
national scale.

Staffed with young but experien-
ced players from Puerto Rico and
the U.S., head coach Miguel Rivera
made the outrageous pre-season

prediction of an-undefeated cam-‘

paign for his third-year team.
Having been a coach of the Puerto

' Rican national team for 10 years and
an All-America at San Jose State
when it captured the national
championship in 1968, Rivera was
used to nothing but success and set
out to fulﬁll his goal.

The Panthers began their quest in
October by hosting the Pitt
Invitational at Trees Pool and
wasted little time showing that they
meant business. Ivy League power
Cornell was the first to drown, 12-5,
and 1975's East champ Bucknell
also bowed, 9-7. Pitt lost, however,
to Mi.chigan, the top-ranked
Midwestern team, 12-11, in the
final game.

Pitt then rambled through the
Cornell Invitational, beatiniz La-

Salle, 32-10 (every Panther scored
in the game), Richmond, 16-8 and
Army, 17-11. The latter contest was

atbattle for eastern supremacy and ‘

revenged three losses to the Cadets.
the year before.

The Michigan Invitational placed.
the Panthers fourth in aseven-team)
ﬁeld. Texas A&M and Loyola

' provided Pitt with devastating 28-16

and 21-9 losses, respectively, but
Rivera pulled his troops together for

a 2-0 win over Kentucky and a 16-14 I L‘
decision against Southern Metho- _ \

dist .

The Panthers raised their record
to 11-3 in the Bucknell Tourney by
sweeping Bucknell, 12-11, Ford-
ham, 13-8, Cornell, _
Syracuse, 18-4, another contest in
which every Panther scored.

Finishing the regular season with
wins over Ohio State, 14-7, and
Youngstown, 17-4, Pitt became the
number-one seed for the MAC
finals, in which the Panthers took an
11-8 decision from Cornell and an
11-0 devastation from Bucknell.

Pantherette Dribblers “Psyched”

enthusiasm of her 5’11” forward.

and we recently recruited two
exceptionally quick guards—Deb-
bie Lewis and Debbie Murray,”
Balthaser explained.

Lewis, a scholarship recipient,
was named state all-toumament
guard during her career at
Abbington High school, while
Murray is a walk-on from Turner
High School in Atlanta, Georgia.

“Wanda Randolph and Kathy
Paczkowski will be valuable assets
with the experience they got this
season,” Balthaser said, “and Terri
Vogt is coming around.”

Also returning are juniors Barb
Welsh, Diane Zaken and Robin Fry.

“This season I’d like to put
players where they can use their
talents best.” Balthaser explained.
“Last year some people like Kit
Loefﬂer and Linda Lesnicli were
playing out of position.

‘ ‘I guess my aim is to get the most
out of everyone,” she continued.
“With the kind of talent we have
coming back I feel we can compete
on the regional leve1—possible
national level.”

In Balthaser’s opinion, last year’s
offense was too structured.

“I hope to switch to an offense
that allows each player to use her
individual skills,” she said.
“Defense will be stressed, but we
won’t press as much—on1y as a
surprise. Basically we’ll concen-
trate on half-court defense.”

‘ Thus far the team is scheduled for!
19 games, with two tourmna-
ments—including the Pitt Invita-
tional in the first weekend of
September and a tour to Mississippi
in the middle of December.

“We hope to draw more
spectators this season,” Balthaser
said.

Another Numberl at Pitt?

By JOHN FINN

The anticipation of a national
championship_—-similar to the one
that gripped the 1976 Pitt football
team——is beginning to stir in the
minds of this year’s Pantherette
volleyball squad.

Cindy Chambers. last year's
MVP. leads a group of five starters
from last year’s squad that
compiled a record of 23-3 as well as
a fourth-place finish in the Eastern
Regionals.

Second-year head coach Mike
Hebert said he expects bigger and
better things from this year’s team.

"We had a fine season last
year." he said. ”and I’m sure we
are stronger this year.”

Also returning from last year’s
squad are Mary Savage and Mary
Iou Susang. Although the two are
only sophomores. they have been
playing together for four years.
beginning at Norwin High School.

There. under the expert coaching
of Sharon Watson. they helped the
Knights capture the 1976 Pennsyl-
vania Interscholastic Athletic As-
sociation (PIAA) State Volleyball
Championship.

At Pitt. Savage and Susang
served as the starting setters or
“quarterbacks" for the offensive

attack.

Andra Pletz. a freshman stand-
out from Stow. Ohio. will return
along with seniors Sue Hershelman
and Diane Zaken. Zaken also plays
basketball for the Pantherettes. _

Pitt's bench was quite strong.
and one of the resons was the play
of Cindy Frye. Frye. a sophomore
who also went to Norwin High
School. has a sister. Mitzi. who
played on the first Pitt Volleyball
team in 1974.

Despite the impressive record of
last year and the fact that so many
letter winners are returning, the
Pantherettes will have their work

cut out for them because of an
expanded 35-game schedule that
includes the top eight finishers at
last year’s Easteriis.

To sell volleyball to the Pitts-
burgh area as well as give students
an opportunity to witness power
volleyball, Pitt will host a 16-team
invitational from October .50 to
November 1 at Trees Hall.

While most Pitt students are
enjoying the summer sun. the
women volleyball players are
diligently working——diving. sweat-

effort to bring another national
championship to Pitt this year.

Tournament. which they captured
in heart-thumping style. After
disposing of New Church Academy
in the opening round, 8-2. Pitt slid
past Ohio University. 3-2. in the
championship game when Tom
Sherwin’s short—handed breakaway
goal shattered a lingering 2-2 tie
with 1:21 remaining. The win gave
Pitt its second Invitational crown in
three tries in one .of the most
exciting finishes ever staged at the
Civic Arena.

In their ﬁnal home game, the
Panthers clouted an oveimatched
Duquesne club. 10-1. for their sixth
consecutive win and began prepar-
ing for eight season-ending road
games. which proved to be up and
down affairs.

Pitt took its 8-1-1 record into
Philadelphia only to lose to ‘the,
Junior Flyers for the second time.
6-4. They bounced back the next
day. however. with a 4-0 shutout
against Mainline. Another two-day
trip saw a strong Princeton team an
8-5 setback before the Panthers
rebounded with a 9-3 clobbering of
Navy a day later. Pitt won its second
in a row against Gannon, 10-6, but
Dayton followed by taking 7-6
decision.

Long assured of another winning
season. the Panthers entered a
rematch series against Ohio Uni-
versity in an attempt to prove that
their earlier victory over the
Bobcats was no fluke. Following
the trend set in their last six
games. the Panthers split the
weekend series. taking the first
contest. 8-2. then bowing in the
season finale. 6-1.

Only defenseman Bob Arturo
will be lost through next year’s
graduation but five other players,
including Vernon and Kimmick.
will be missing. Bud Connelly and
Don Deltondo quit the team last
season for various reasons and
Russ Stump, Pitt's enforcer on the
ice. left to participate in a
work-study program in Wyoming.

Filling the holes left by these
playes seems to be the least of
Barcalow's problems right now.
The perennial issue of ﬁlling a
budget. for which the club never
receives aid from the athletic
department. is the number-one
concern. According [0 Barcalow.
next season's Student Govei'nn‘.ent
allocation has already been cut from
last year’s allowance but he, along
with club president Jim Wayne and
ither club members, is currently
gvorking on the problem.

Pushing all these drawbacks
aside, Barcalow predicts that next
year will produce a good club and
another winning season.

“After all." he said. “I ain’t in
this thing to lose."

Golf Future Sub-Par

By JOHN FINN

Unlike most teams in Pitt’s large
and rapidly improving athletic
prograiii.‘the future of the Panther
golf team is not too bright.

Although golf is a varsity sport.
no scholarships are awarded to
golfers at Pitt. The reason is that
most golfers with any pro potential
attend universities and colleges in
the South. where. the weather is
warmer and the season lasts almost
the entire year.

Despite the circumstances. coach
Steve Petro is not complaining.

.“We just have to make the best
of things.” he said. A

The Panthers were not able to
capture a tournament or win

Men

match during the 1976-77 season.
which featured both fall and spring
competition.

Pitt will be losing its captain. Bill
Burkardt. because his eligibility
has been spent. Although
Burkardt suffered through a dismal
season after being stricken with
viral ulcers. he was a valuable asset
to the team. Also leaving is Bob
Kurey. who graduated in April.

With the only two veterans gone.
the Panthers will have to rely on
youth. The potential for future
success rests jointly on the
shoulders of sophomores Alan
English and Jim McGrath_ Both
players tur_ned in several outstand-
ing scores during the seson. -and

McGrath finished as Pitt's medalist
(low scorer) on three occasions.

Although the Pitt golf team does
not actively recruit. Petro noted
that several students who are fine
golfers have expressed an interest
in playing for the Panthers this
year.

Pitt’s stiffest competition came
from Indiana (Pa.) and Penn State
last season and both teams are
9-‘Dected to be tough once again.

Petro believes that his team will
improve. “We have a young team.
and with Jim (McGrath) and Alan
(English) as team leaders. I think
we can look forward to a successful
season." he said,

aNetters Take

Unexcused Win Absence

By JIM PANE

Pitt tennis coach George Dief-
fenbach could be making excuses
about the 1977 tennis season. But
he isn't.

His team got off to a rousing
start by playing mostly local
opponents but settled for a 6-6

record after dropping its last five

matches. Instead of excuses.
though. Dieffenbach offered a
reasonable explanation for Pitt's
downfall.

“We just ran into tougher
competition during the second half
of the schedule.” Dieffenbach said.

A .500 season isn't much to
shout about but due-to Dieffen-
bach’s»rookie coaching efforts the
Panthers managed to best last
year's mark of 5-7.

As Dieffenbach later said, “It’s
better than a losing season.”

In April when the Panthers were
cruising along with a 4-0 record and
early May when they still had an
impressive 6-1 slate. breaking even
was the furthest thing from
anyone’s mind.

“You could say I’m disappoint-
ed.” Dieffenbach said. “I’m
certainly not happy with the way
things turned out."

The campaign began harmlessly
enough in -October when the
Panthers chalked up a 2-1 record in
the fall exhibition season. beating
WVU. 5-4, and West Liberty. 8-1.
then losing to California State
(Pa.), 5-4.

The team enjoyed a four-month
layoff before uniting with the
women netters to capture the
Saranac Cup Invitational on Feb-
ruary 26. They then had a month to
prepare for a pre-season warm-up

- tour through the South in late

March.

Although Pitt failed to muster a
win in the five-day trip. Dieffen-
bach returned with highhopes for
the coming season.

“The trip exposed us to good
weather and good competition."
Dieffenbach said. ‘‘It prepared us
mentally and physically for our
upcoming season. We will
definitely do it again next year."

The sunny southern weather
supplied Pitt with valuable outdoor
playing time while other area
teams were still waiting to hit the
courts for the first time. The jump
on local talent surfaced immed-
iately as the Panthers quickly found
themselves owning a 4-0 record at
the expense of Carnegie-Mellon.
Robert Morris. Akron and Slippery
Rock.

"The matches against Akron and
Slippery Rock were the high points
of the season." Dieffenbach said.
"Akron beat us. 5-4. last year and
we conipletely reversed the score
season. The same thing

happened against Slippery Rock
only the score was 6-3."

WVU then handed Pitt a 9-0
thrashing and the Panthers re-
venged their first loss by shellack-
ing crosstown rival Duquesne, 8-1,
to conclude April’s action and give
Dieffenbach’s crew a 5-1 record.

April flowers brought May
showers as the Pitt losses came in a
cloudburst. The final month’s only
victory came against Robert Mor-

ris. 6-3. for the Panthers’ second
win over the Colonials.‘

The edge over local teams
provided by the southern trip
didn't apply, however, when the
team traveled to Ohio for a.two-day
tournament that started Pitt’s
downfall. The University of
Cincinnati and Washington and‘
Lee University sent the Panthers
reeling with 9-0 and 8-1 setbacks,
respectively.

Lewis Not Puzzled Over
Piecing Panthers Together

By MARY S. HUZINEC

Pitt baseball coach Bob Lewis is
anxious to see his fall team.

“I’m looking forward to putting
all the pieces together,” he said’.
“We’1l need some pitching, but
other than that we should be in good
shape.”

Kurt Leitholf announced a few
weeks ago that next year he will
attend Pitt’s graduate school, so the
entire inﬁeld will be back.

Leitholf, the third baseman, will
rejoin Ken Muckle at first, Joe
Adlesic at second and Dan Skinner
at shortstop. Last season they
batted .323, .278, .313 and .361
respectively.

Dan DeStout, senior catcher,
team captain, MVP and team leader
in average (.416), at bats (72), hits
(30), home runs (5), doubles (8) and
RBI’s (5) will be missed.

“Dan’s hitting was a pleasant
surprise this season,” said coach
Lewis. “He has a lot of desire. I’d
like to see him get the opportunity to
play some professional baseball.”

With the exception of Melvin
Howard, the entire outﬁeld—Don
Nania, Gary Majetic, Mark Stevens
and Tony Roperti——wi1l be return-
ing the fall.

“Melvin helped us for three
years,” said Lewis. “We’ll really
miss him.”

The pitching staff is losing Don
Kennedy and Les Qualk, two of the
most consistent starters. -They
ﬁnished the season with a 4.62 and a
2.04 ERA, respectively. Marc
Bianco led the team with a 1.35
ERA.

Tony DiSaia, Dave Crist, Don
Koller, Mark Falvo and Jim Boyle

1 will all be returning for the pitching

staff.

This year Lewis hopes to have
tryouts in September instead of
waiting until spring. “We never
played games in the fall before,” he
said, “but I" think it would help to
start earlier. It would also be easier
to handle the guys on the ﬁeld
instead of in the gym.‘

“The nucleus of the team will be

back so this coming season should
be a good one.”

PITTCHES: DeStout is presently
in Texas trying out for the Harlingin
Sons, a Triple A baseball team.

James Pastin from Sto Rox High
School will replace DeStout as-
catcher in the fall. Lewis also
recruited pitcher John Stuper from
Butler and outﬁelder Walt Duke-
wich form Langley.

Lewis is still waiting to hear from
Penn Hills first baseman Ed
Adams, and Duquesne pitcher Mik
Luciow. -

Tankers Recruit Well 8

By Just LEWIS

Head coach Dick Bradshaw
wanted a third Easterns title for his
swimming and diving crew—it’s
that simple.

So when it came time to recruit,
Bradshaw and his staff—diving
coach Al Coffey, and assistant
coaches Kate Mathison and Fred
Lewis—outdid themselves by per-
suading a number of talented
swimmers and divers to replace
graduating seniors like All-America
Jerry DeMuro, Tom F atyol and Tim
Dowd.

“As far as quality goes, this has
been one of the best recruiting
years,” stated Bradshaw. “You
usually get one or two high school
All-American performers in a year,
but we’ve recruited seven.”

Among the prizewinning crop are
swimmers Stuart Swanson of
Florida, Tom McGinley of Wilkes-
Barre, Mickey Termin of Harris-
burg, Bill Stevenson of New Jersey
and Jeff Trew of Shaler, plus divers
Chris Mano of Virginia and Pat
Greenwell of Kiski Prep.

Rounding out the ﬁeld are divers
Mike Reinhard of Warren and
Mount Lebanon’s Steve Simich,
who are able artists in their own
right.

Although the season opener is
about six months away, Bradshaw
already has plans for his new
recruits.

“We’re hoping they can replace
our seniors,” Bradshaw. stated.
“Jeff and Mickey will probably ﬁll

in for DeMuro.”

Bradshaw will need replacements
for DeMuro, Fatyol and Dowd if he
hopes to ﬁnish close to the 7-2
record his squad posted last year on
their way to Eastern swimming
supremacy. This season's schedule
includes home matches against
powerhouses Maryland, Ohio State,
Cleveland State and North Carolina,
four of the best teams in college
swimming.

“I’m looking for 10 good meets '

this year,” Bradshaw claimed,
’ ‘and am hoping to win the Easterns
for a third straight vear.”

This season, seven of the eight '

qualiﬁers are returning and Pitt will
host the Easterns at familiar Trees
Hall Pool. These factors will
provide an extra edge along with the
great recruiting year.

Gymnasts to Impro ve

Pitt women's gvmnastics coach
Donna DeMarino was pleased with
the team's 1976-77 season and looks
for better things from the 1977-78
Pantherette squad.

Pitt compiled a 4-3 dual meet
slate which included losses to
national champion Clarion State
(Pa.) and third-place ﬁnisher Penn
State. '

“I am pleased with the team's
performance and maturity.” De-
Marino said. “Our last year’s
team was composed mostly of
freshmen and sophomores. one
junior and one senior.”

The squad has improved tre-
mendously in recent years.'De-
Marino said. “Three years ago. we
placed ﬁfth in the Penn State
Collegiate Championships. This
year. we beat out Slippery Rock by

four-tenths of a point to take first
place. Likewise, we went from 2lst
place three years ago in the
Eastern Regionals to seventh place
last season.

“We seem to have our best
meets against the better competi-
tion." DeMarino. added.

Among the returning team
members are sophomores Regina
Carson and Alison Hoburg. Carson
ﬁnished first and Hoburg second.
with scores of 35.3 and 34.2. in the

, all-around competition at the state

championships last season. Senior
Cyndee Severyn and sophomore
Germaine Zubritsky also join the
list of returning all-around com-
petitors.

Coach DeMarino also was
enthusiastic about recruiting for
the upcoming season.

Harriers to Stay Home

By JIM LEWIS

No home meets? A person would

;, be crazy to think that any sports

team could be successful with a
season schedule devoid of matches
in familiar home surroundings.
But life on the road is what the
Pitt men’s cross-country squad
faced last fall, and they responded

well, with a ﬁnal 5-2 record against .

West Virginia, Indiana (Pa.),
Allegheny Community College,
Syracuse and Ohio State—all on
opposition courses.

Besides a second-place ﬁnish in
the California State Invitational
September 18, the Panthers capped
a better-than-average season by

sending junior Mel Boyd to the
NCAA ﬁnals in Texas.

This year, the tables will turn-
all meets against the same seven
opponents will be at home in
friendly Schenley Park. That fact,
coupled with minimal graduation
loss and a good incoming group of
freshmen, has head coach Mike
Agostinella anticipating a fine
season.

“We should have . a lot of
experience this year,” he claimed.
“We’ll have a strong, veteran,
well-seasoned team.”

Terry Wile is the only graduate
leaving the squad, and the void will
be filled by Randy Bailey,
