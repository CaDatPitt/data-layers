Scientists in Pitt’s Allegheny Observa-
tory discovered earthquake activity

inthe region, thanks in part to a new

seismograph.

While people in southwestern
Pennsylvania might not think of the
region as a seismically active area, a
new seismograph captured evidence
of constant earthquakes too small for
people to feel.

William Harbert, a professor in
Pitt’s department of geology and
planetary sciences, said the new
seismograph is sensitive enough to
record earthquakes within 124 miles
of Pittsburgh, which previous equip-
ment could not detect. _

Pitt and Penn State maintain the
state-ﬁmded seismograph, which is
located in the North Side. It is part of
a nationwide effort between several
universities called the Incorporated
Research Institutions for Seismol-
ogy, or IRIS.

The group maps out seismic ac-
tivity across the nation in hopes of
developing a better understanding
of Earth’s internal structure.

Though not as seismically active
as otherparts of the nation, the Pitts-
burgh machine ﬁlls a gap in the net-
work. It can pick up seismic activity
from’ thousands of miles away.

Harbert said that soon after the
seismograph was installed it de-
tected a 6.2 magnitude earthquake
in Alaska, nearly 4,000 miles away

. from Pittsburgh.

“Pitt’s station ﬁlls a data gap and
places us in a group of universities and
institutions responsible for providing
the accounts seismologists need to
know how seismic activity in one area
of the world resonates everywhere,”
he said.

Seismograph detects tremors in Pennsylvania

Scientists read seismic activity on the seismograph located in Pitt’s Allegheny Observatory

Harbert compared the network
sonogram, which takes images of the
inside of a person. , 0

“With a sonogram, you essen-
tially have a vibrating source and a
receiver that takes apicture inside of
the person,” he said. “Imagine instead
you have one source and hundreds of

‘ receivers.”

This seismograph is not the ﬁrst
one at Pitt. Workers built a seismo-
graph into the Cathedral when it was
under construction, but took it out
for the 1950s.

The new seismograph, located on

the North Side, is directly connected
to the Internet and sends its data over
the Realtime and U.S.=regional net-
works to the center of IRIS, inseattle.

« It does this with one one-hundredth

of a second of latency, allowing for
unprecedented real time mapping of
seismic activity in the United States,

Harbert said.

“One thing your generation is
beneﬁtting from is incredibly dense
network,” he added. A _

Harbert said the seismograph is
also capable of recording events that
might impactthe region such as storm

activity, man-made events ‘caused by
sequestering carbon underground
or pumping water underground to

_ retrieve natural gas.

Harbert said that between coal
and natural gas mining, “Pennsylva-
nia is going through a revolution in
terms of energy production.”

This makes it even more impor-
tant to be able to detect the impact
of seismic activity and other events,
he said.

“There are questions we can an-
swer from, ‘How many small earth-
quakes have occurred in this area,’ 

to whether we’l1 create small earth-
quakes by pumping carbon into the
ground,” he said. “There is so much
we can learn about our region from
this.”

The seismographwillalso be used

as an educational aid. Harbert plans ‘

to use the data in his classes to help
students learn how scientists deter-
mine the location and magnitude of
earthquakes.

He said he also hopes the ‘Carn-
egie Museum of Natural History will

display some of the seismographs’

data. ~

Study challenges diabetes meds

Simone Cheatham
Staff Writer

Pitt researchers, along with others
nationwide, found that basic lifestyle

. changescanreducediabetes symptoms

inadults more effectivelythandiabetes—
related drugs.

Pit:t’s Graduate School of Public
Health recently ﬁnished a 10-year
study called the Diabetes Prevention
Program Outcomes Study, a nationwide
effort ﬁmded by the National Institute

‘of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney

Diseases. c

According to the study, recently
published on TheLancet.com, adults
who committed to “intensive lifestyle
changes” to lose weight delayed the
onset of'I‘ype 2 diabetes by about four
years, comparedto two years by those
who took the preventative drug Met-
formin.

Some ofthese changes included 150
minutes of exercise perweek and eating
foods with less fat and calories.

The American Diabetes Association
estimatesthat23.6 million childrenand
adults have the disease andthat57 mil-
lion people have prediabetes.

Type 2 diabetes makes up between

90 and 95 percentofthecases, accord-
ingto the association. Type 2 diabetes
can appear in younger adults, but it
occurs more frequently with increas-
ing age.

Elizabeth Venditti, director of the
Lifestyle Resource Core for the study
and assistant professor of psychiatry
at Pitt, said the results were somewhat
expected but show the importance of
having healthy habits.

The disease keeps appearing
in younger people.

Elizabeth Venditti

“It may seem like losing a bit of
weight and trying to exercise 150
minutes perweekforyourlife isn’tthat
hard,”Vendit1isaid.‘“ThatseernspretIy
distant to a college student, but rates
ofpeople withType2 diabetes usedto
only consist of adults. That’s not the
case anymore.” .

Vendit1isaid'I‘ype2diabetessy1np—
toms continue to manifest in younger

adults, attributingthe change to  in— _l

crease in obesity among children an
young adults. ‘ . ' ’

“The heavier and more sedentary
our students become, the more the
disease keeps appearing in younger
people,” Venditti added.

Shealsosaid college students should
“take heedofthe results” iftheyhavea
family history of the disease.

“Even if you’re not overweight and
eat healthy, people with a family his-
tory of the disease or those who are

_ Aﬁican—American, Hispanic Ameri-

can, Native American or Paciﬁc Islander
haveadisproporlionately higher rate,”
Venditti said.

Researchers said they’d like to offer
a course credit program to teach col-
lege students aboutbehaviorallifestyle
decisions. The programwould serveas

_ a place for at—risk students to go if they
wanted guidance on losingweight, eat— A

in college and in the future.

“Weight has a way of creeping up
on you, and not everyone likes to play

“If everyone ‘keeps voting,

it needs to be an effort on every-

Because the contest requires
people to vote through Facebook,
each person only gets one vote per
account, unlike other online con-
tests that allowed people to vote
multiple times. ,

The Motorola CLIQ Challenge
isn’t the ﬁrst time Pitt students have
waged multi-campus Facebook bat-
tles to attract celebrity gigs.

In 2007, AT&T launched its
Loudest Pep Rally promotion, a
collegiate competition in which
fans texted their votes in hopes of
winning a free Dave Matthews Band
concert on campus.

With the aid of a Facebook
group called “Dave Matthews Band,

voted their way to the top three
of 120 competing schools at one

But by the time the competition
closed in October, Pittfell from the
rankings, giving way to the ultimate
winner, the U.S. Military Academy,
which was followed by the Air Force
Academy and the U.S. Naval Acad-
emy in second and third places,
respectively. V

Pitt also fell short of a 2007 pro-
motion to bring comedian Dane
Cook to campus, although the Fa-
cebook group “Bring Dane Cook
to Pitt!” still has 993 members. In

this competition, people could text-

votes up to 50 times each day.
Despite the tough track record
for winning celebrity contest ap-

pearances, junior Alex Smith is

convinced that Pitt is a contend-
ing school for the free Weezer
concert. .

Facebook group with fellow Pitt
business student Zachary Adams

Motorola CLIQ phone and the newest Weezer
album, Ratzﬁtde.

Though he received four promotional
CLIQ cell phones to use during the contest,
Smith admits that his motivation doesn’t
stem from the phone’s new features.

“We don’t really care about the phone,” he
said. “We just want the free concert!”

If Pitt wins the voting contest, T-Mobile
representatives will decide where and when
to hold the Weezer concert on campus.

Since the online voting system records
participants’ names, Smith said, “Everyone
who voted for the winning team gets the ﬁrst
shot at tickets.”

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said the Uni-
versity attracts various performances even
without online Voting.

“Speakers, artists and musicians can
come to Pitt through any number of dif-
ferent means,” he wrote in an e-mail. “The
main way is through being sponsored by
an organization, anything from a student
organization to a school, a department or
a center.”

Fedele added that he has no memory of
Pitt winning a celebrity promotional appear-
ance, but since the University does not keep
track, it “doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened”
in the past.

Smith said Facebook allows students
from across the Pittsburgh region to par-
ticipate in the Vote —— which could provide
a major advantage.

“If we ‘could pull together people from
Duquesne and Carnegie Mellon  we could
pull together Pittsburgh and have the con-
cert here,” he said, adding that he’s sent Fa-
cebook invitations to students at Pittsburgh-
area colleges and high schools alike.

The promotion is set up as a Facebook
event, which allows Smith, Adams and at-
tendees to continually invite people.

Pitt currently boasts more than 2,640
votes in the contest — less than half the
number of listed attendees in the Facebook
event.

She received an invitation to the Weezer
promotional group but declined the offer be-
cause she didn’t think it would be effective.

“I don’t think it actually does anything,”
she said. “It’s just a bunch of kids in a group
— it’s not actually getting to the Pitt Program
Council to bring anyone here.”

While it’s not meant as a reﬂection of
her musical preferences, Tuli said she is so
conditioned to receiving Facebook “spam”

that she usually ignores invitations before
even reading them.

“Don’t get me wrong, I think Weezer is
chill, but they’re not gonna come here,” she
said. g

Still, Dickinson maintains that he’d rather
vote than miss the chance for a free con-
cert.

“It took ﬁve seconds, plus I get to see Wee-
zer for free,” he said. “Spending ﬁve seconds
of my life voting is no big deal.”

Fund libraries,
not pension funds

ity residents gathered in Oak-

land yesterday to protest the

closings and mergers of numer-
ous Carnegie libraries.

Because of a declining population,
stagnant contributions from the city
and rising costs and structural deﬁ-
ciencies, the Carnegie Library System
of Pittsburgh faces a serious budget
shortfall. To keep functioning without
cuts, the system needs an extra $1.5
million next year and $5.1 million by
2014, according to the Pittsburgh
Tribune—Review.

It’s diﬁicult to ﬁnd this money, es-
peciallyinarecession, so the systemis
likelyto close the Hazelwood, West End,
I.awrenceville and Beechviewbranches.
The Carrick and Knoxvillebrancheswill
be merged, while the Mt. Washington
branch will move to Virginia Avenue.

Suzanne Thinnes, communica-
tion manager forthe Carnegie system,
said that should the libraries close, the
bookswillbe sold, distributedto other
local libraries or donated to children’s
charities. It’s not as if books will be
burned, but theywillbe less accessible
to Pittsburgh residents. Ifyou’ve ever
wonderedwhypeople don’t read more,
here is one reason.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl wants to
donate $1 million annually to the Cam-
egie systemfromthe revenue generated
byhisproposedlpercenttaxon college
tuition. This might seem more noble if
the city had not kept its Carnegie sys-
tem contribution locked at an annual
$40,000 — the amount originally re-
quested by Andrew Carnegie in 1890.
Because Carnege did not technically
include an inﬂation adjustment provi-
sion, Pittsburgh never increased the
contribution.

How’s thatfora“fair share”?

_ Thankﬁilly, City Council President
Doug Shields is stepping up. He wants
the cityto givea$L2 million grantfrom
its operating budget to the library sys-
tem over the next two years.

It seems logical that abad economy
would drive more people to libraries,
but the branches targeted for closing
operate in neighborhoods with declin-
ingpopulations. Thishas raised the av-

erage cost pervisit; For instance, avisit
to the West End branch costs $9.60,
and the other targeted branches are

somewhere near $5 pervisit, according
to a CMU study. The Oakland branch
still averages only $2.20 per visit.

Unfortunately, some of the closings
are happening in the neighborhoods
that need libraries the most. The 
branch in Oakland is comprehensive
and historic, but practically spealdng,
Hillrnan is next door. And residents in
West End or Hazelwood might not be
ableto compensatewithalostfreebook
byGoogle searchingit. Libraries provide
many families’ only Internet access.

These branches need to stay open,
and they need their deﬁciencies ad-
dressed — such as partial— or non-
compliance with federal handicap
standards and a lack of air condition-
ing. Itis likely that remaining residents
use these libraries less because of such
shortcomings.

Nothing is free, though. The mon-
ey has to come from somewhere. As
students, we support the education
provided by public libraries. IfRaven—
stahl were truly serious about saving
the lﬂararies —— and not just ﬁlling city
pension coffers — he would narrow
his tax proposal to one-sixteenth of 1
percent to generate solely the revenue
needed for the Carnegie system.

The entire higher education com-
munity would ﬁnd this motive and
percentage much more palatable.

Or instead ofthe city outright reject-
ingthe Pittsburgh Public Fund offer of
a $5.5 million donation for 2008-10,
the city should bargainfor $8.5 million.
Again, this would generate the per an-
num amount Ravenstahl wants to give
to the Carnegie system, and, at a little
more than halfof the traditional past
donation, it is still a fair compromise
for the Public Fund.

The Carnegie System serves the
community, and it deserves com-
munity support. When the residents
demonstrated on Wednesday, some
broughttheir children along. The Pitts-
burgh Post—Gazette quoted a 6-year-
old  “I like the library because
I like books, and I like science books.”
Pitisburgh, especially the educational
community, should help this kid keep

I hissciencebooks.

pathyshouldgetconﬂatedwithﬁinding

Ultra-nerd: An endangered species

Where are our modem—day Minkuses?

 
  
 

Katie Azzara
‘ Columnist

Something that you, hopefully,
would not be able to tell by looking
at me is the fact that I am a nerd.
I’m not saying that I’m Screech from
“Saved by the Bell,” but I deﬁnitely
have my geeky tendencies.

First of all, there’s my need to
succeed academically. To me, get-
ting a B isunderachieving, and there
is some strange force inside of me
that refuses to miss a class — or
even a homework assignment, for
that matter. I actually start to feel
panicky at the thought of skippinga
lecture or not doing a required read-
ing,~even when I know the conse-
quences will be minimal. Last year, I
came down with mononucleosis and
managed to miss only two classes.

But I get even nerdier. I’ve har-
bored an obsession with “Harry
Potter” since an extremely young
age. I’ve waited in seemingly never-
ending lines for both the books and
movie tickets — the midnight show-
ing on opening night, of course.
I’ve even paid to see a band called

“Harry and the Potters.” When I ﬁn— ‘

ished reading the seventh book, the
last of the series, I went through a
dark period that my mother termed
“Post-Potter Depression.”

Still, the nerdiest thing about me
would have to be my love of video
games. Ever since my hands were
big enough to hold a controller,
I’ve been captivated by the magical
world of virtual games. Some of my

of being a nerd does not quite mean
the same thing today as it did when
I was growing up.

In my childhood, I was bombard-

Urban agriculture growing trend

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

 
 

Instead of taking notes’ during
class, a friend recently began till-
ing his land and harvesting his veg-
etables. I am, of course, referring
to the land and vegetables he owns
Virtually on the popular Facebook
application called FarmVille.
FarmVille, since its launch in
June, has become the most popu-
lar application in the history of
Facebook. More than 62 million
people operate their own cyber-

farms. But this seemingly distant .

world of blueberries, barns and
bunnies is not as remote as you
might believe.

If you were hoping to read about
the latest FarmVille cheat codes,
I’m sorry. I speak of a different type
of farming — the urban kind.

Urban agriculture has been
around for quite a while longer
than its computerized counter-

part but hasn’t caught on nearly

as quickly.

Urban agriculture is the prac-
tice of cultivating food in or around
a city. Although people have grown
food in cities for centuries, this
type of farming is taking an in-
creasingly important role as cit-
ies expand in population and land
area.

When it comes to energy effi-
ciency and quality of food, urban
agriculture beats industrial farm-
ing, hands down. This alternative
combats the known shortcom-
ings of factory farming, including
depletion of soil nutrients, water
contamination and the excessive
use of fossil fuels.

In the recent success of urban
farms like Growing Power in Mil-
waukee, we can see the potential
that urban agriculture holds. Not

only can it produce necessities for
an urban population, it can also
revitalize communities once con-
sidered dead.

Will Allen, a professional
basketball player-turned-busi-
nessman-turned—farmer, started
Growing Power 16 years ago and
continues to helm the organiza-
tion.

Located in one of Milwaukee’s
most economically distressed
neighborhoods, Growing Power’s

main farm operates on 2 acres of '

land surrounded by grocery stores
ﬁlled with beer, cigarettes and pro-
cessed foods.

Such bleak prospects haven’t
stopped Allen. His dedication to
providing his community with
healthier choices created an en-
thusiasm for farming in Milwaukee
residents. '

Nearly 2,000 residents volun-
teer, allowing Allen to focus his at-
tention on integrating techniques
such as aquaponics and vermi-
compost to improve the quality
of Growing Power’s harvests.

This isn’t just another passing
green trend. .

In September, the MacAr-

thur Foundation awarded Allen.

a $500,000 grant that gave him
the resources to dream bigger and
make Growing Power more energy
independent. '

The success of Growing Power
has inspired other farmers from all
over the country, including here in
Pittsburgh.

Grow Pittsburgh, started in
2005, is dedicated to growing
food, farmers and the community.
Its projects range from teaching
kids the basics of farming to work-
ing in the greenhouse of the Frick
Art and Historical Center.

Like other urban farms across
the nation, Grow Pittsburgh’s Brad-

dock Farms rejuvenate the city’s
neglected neighborhoods.

A booming business district
in the 1950s and ’60s, Braddock
has fallen on hard times, leaving
its residents, young and old, job-
less. ..

But the plot of land located be-
hind U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson
Plant has provided job opportu-
nities for young people as well as
fresh, nutritious produce.

The most exciting part of urban
agriculture is that we’ve yet to test
its limits. ,

The goal behind “vertical
farms” is to bring farming into
the heart of a city. With limited
space in cities like New York and
Shanghai, the logical agricultural
option is creating farms that shoot
several stories into the sky.

Population increases might
eventually leave traditional farm-
ers without much land. But the ver-
tical farm concept could help com-

bat that problem, not to mention .

the harmful effects of traditional
farming like excess agricultural
runoff and deforestation.

Ultimately, the most appealing
aspect of urban farming isn’t nec-
essarily ﬁghting economic injustice
or saving the environment.

It just might be the prospect of
being able to produce our own food
right in our metropolitan back-
yards. Maybe that’s why so many
of us are interested in applications
like FarmVille.

It might be a bit late in the
growing season to start your own
garden or have a major impact on
local urban agricultural initiatives.
But the spring could provide us the
opportunity to bring our virtual
aspirations into the real world.

Embrace your
inner—nerd

Azzara 4 6

66

Modern popular culture has
forgotten the art of nerd portrayal.

colorful glasses and plaid shirts --
all of which are totally fashionable
today. ‘

Consider the modern-day
“nerds” that currently exist in popu-
lar culture. If we take it a step beyond
physical appearance and think of
a nerd as someone who is socially
awkward, then basically every char-
acter ever played by Michael Cera
would have to be considered a nerd.
Think about George Michael Bluth
(“Arrested Development”), Paulie
Bleeker (“Juno”) and Evan (“Super—
bad”). These characters, though
deﬁnitely displaying some nerdy
features, always end up coming out
on top, so they can’t really be consid-
ered nerds in the classic sense.

_Other recent examples include
characters like Seth Cohen, Ugly
Betty and Dwight Schrute, who are
all portrayed as much more than
just nerds.

In fact, these characters are actu-
ally pretty cool. It seems that they
simply don’t make them like they
used to. Where is 2009’s Stewart
Minkus or Carlton Banks?

Modern popular culture has
forgotten the art of nerd portrayal.
Some might consider this to be a

good thing, a way to put an end to
unfair labels and stereotypes, but
I see this deﬁciency as more of a
detriment.

As you may have guessed, I fully
embrace my nerdiness. While it
might not be visible on the outside,
my nerdy characteristics have helped
to shape who I am today. Without the
Screeches and Urkels who deﬁned
the concept for me when I was grow-
ing up, I never would have been able
to identify these aspects of my per-
sonality as nerdy.

I’m tired of seeing the same
beautiful, trendy, stereotypically
cool people on TV, like the cast of
“Gossip Girl” or “The Hills.” These
shows don’t even pretend to have
characters that represent the nerd
population. Where is the fun in
that?

When was the last time you saw
anactual nerd, complete with braces,
pocket protector and an endearing
lisp? It’s time that we put intelligent,
socially awkward, uniquely dressed
nerds who are true individuals in
every sense of the word, back into
the public consciousness.

‘Candide’ boasts good music, set design

Voltaire’s classic story is re-styled to suit its setting, an old car dealership

Noah Levinsonl
Senior Staff Writer
“Candide”
Quantum Theatre
Nov. 5-22

Wednesdays through Saturdays
at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7 p.m.
Location: Former Don Allen Auto
City on 5315 Baum Blvd.

Until recently,‘the Don Allen
Auto City building on Baum Bou-
levard in Bloomﬁeld sat lifeless
and empty.

The same spot where many
Pittsburghers may have bought
their ﬁrst car is now the stage of a
modern production of the classic
show “Candide,” thanks to Quan-
tum Theatre.

The original 1956 Leonard
Bernstein operetta is based on a
satire written by Voltaire, which
celebrates its 250th anniversary
this year.

The operetta revolves around
a young man named Candide and
his quest to rescue the beautiful,
kidnapped Cunegonde.

Along the way, Candide en-

counters various philosophies that
cause him to question the way he
lives his life.

Set designer Tony Ferrieri
helped create the show’s unique
set in the Don Allen Auto City

building.

“It was a big, empty space that
we needed for this production,”
Ferrieri said.

It wasn’t an accident that the
defunct car dealership ended up

as the stage, according to stage
director Karla Boos.

“We were looking for a derelict,
modern ruin,” Boos said.

The production is ﬂooded with
modern automobile-related puns

Laurie Klatscher (the Old Lady) and Nicole Ann Kaplan (Cunegonde)

and props.

Car seats are used for powerful
characters’ thrones, Cunegonde’s
jewelry box is a toolbox, and the
orchestra members even dress in
mechanics’ coveralls.

“Everything we use is either
from a car or somehow related to
a car,” Ferrieri said. To ﬁnd what
they needed to ﬁll the vast emp-
ty garage, Ferrieri and his crew
searched through mechanic shops
and junk yards.

“We were only using one—tenth
of the space of the building,” Fer-
rieri said. “It was more of a blank
palette to work with than other
shows.”

Boos is also the artistic director -

and founder of Quantum Theatre,
which launched in 1990. “Can-
dide” has proven to be one of her
most ambitious projects yet.

“There was no heat, there was
no water, only limited power, and
we were playing in 13,000 square
feet,” Boos said. “To light 13,000
square feet with limited power is
an amazing challenge.”

Thecset design was one of many
decisions that Boos made with
Ferrieri and her music director,
Andres Cladera.

The English Beat caters toolder

For The Pitt News

The English Beat
Diesel Club Lounge
Nov. 13, 7 p.m.

+21

For a band that got its start in the
1970s, The English Beat shows no
signs of slowing down.

The band plays a lot of new songs
on its 30th anniversary tour, but the
old hits, such as Mirror in the Bath
room, continue to be favorites arm » g
young and old audiences alike.

When frontrnan Dave Wakeling



plays songs he wrote 30 years ago he
tries to “stay in the moment” by con-
necting the audience with a shared
sense of nostalgia.

“From the audience’s point of
view, a song that you wrote 30 years
ago had an important function in

_ their life and they have all their

memories wrapped up in it, too,”
he said.

He formed the group in Birming-
ham, England, in 1979, creating mu-
sic that mixed ska, rock and soul that
broke down age, class and race bar-
riers and still continues to embrace
a variety of audiences.

However, Friday at Diesel the
band will make an exception to this-

non-inclusiveness.

The show is 21 and older because
Wakeling claimed the band’s tradi-
tionally older fan base can “get a
bit sick of teenagers crowd surﬁng
because they can’t dance.

“Sometimes we do some shows so
that old folks can enjoy themselves,”
Wakeling said.

But the band hasn’t shied away
from reaching out to new, younger
fans either. This summer it toured
with ska-punk band Reel Big Fish.

Wakeling was thrilled to connect
with young fans but was a bit disap-
pointed when they hadn’t heard of
the band. But by the end of the tour,
Wakeling said, one fan summed it up

E«'.'»‘.‘5£.'::iz"ﬂ

7.1? 5' 

perfectly: “Excuse me, sir, I never
heard of ya’ll but ya’ll’s awesome!”

Wakeling hopes to do more all-
ages shows in the future.

“I like open shows because you
might see somebody who’s 60 and
you might see someone 16, and
they’re dancing the same dance
at the same tempo,” he said, “But
they’re not embarrassed to be in each
other’s company.”

The band has blended differ-
ences together since its beginning.

In the 1970s, Wakeling described
his music as a “punky-reggae party,”
inﬂuenced by the upbeat ska and reg-
gae music fromjamaica that drifted
overseas to be played before British

soccer games.

But Wakeling wasn’t quite ready
to be boxed into one genre.

“We were trying to hybrid and
mix up all of our favorite music,” he
said. “And make a dance beat that
was irresistible regardless of age or
color or any other demarcation that
could be used as a division.”

The fusion of beats successfully
combated the black—and—white divi-
sions in British society.

Dancing at clubs on weekends
made it easier for different races
to get along in day-to—day affairs
throughout rest of the week.

ill Vampire Weekend avoid a sophomore slump?

Kelsey Shea
 Assistant A&E Editor

Vampire Weekend is dropping its new
album injanuary, and as much as its
Afrobeat pop pleases my collegiate
taste, I’m worried.

After its self-entitled debut, I
have high expectations for the band’s
follow—up album, and anything less
than awesome is going to be bitterly
disheartening.

Getting an anticipated but disap-
pointing albumfrom one of yourfavor—
ite artists is downright crushing.

I Justaskanyweezerfanthat recent-
ly had the misfortune to pick up and
then promptly cast aside the band’s
new album Raditude.

There are some bands you don’t
really have to worry about. Industry
veterans know how to smoothly tran-
sition from one album, sound or even
genre to another.

The Decemberists, for example,
didn’t give me this much grief when I
was waiting for Hazards ofLorve.

I had a lot of faith in Colin Meloy
and pretty muchbelievedthathe could
come out on stage clanging pots and
pans and singingthe Canadian nation-

al anthem and still miraculously pull it
off and make it cool —— or interesting
at the very least.

But Vampire Weekend?

They’re just babies! On the indie
rock scene at least.

Lead singer Ezra Koenig and his
Columbia buddies have to meet the
towering expectations of fans of their
debut album. _

When Vampire Weekend came
onto the scene a few years ago, they
were fun and different with a cocky
Ivy League boy attitude — and we
liked it.

Even the ever—pretentious Pitch-
fork threw the coveted “Best New
Music” button on its review of the
album.

There was a bit of novelty in its
quirky sound, and it brought some-
thing new and refreshing to college
radios.

Two years later, the band has
moved on from its days on Colum-
bia’s campus and has been playing its
Afropop music for a much larger audi-
ence than those acadernic elite.

And with the buzz circulating
around its upcoming album, it seems
to be everywhere, which only builds
up the hype. 

You can hear them on HP’s new
commercial, learn guitar from Koenig
onhisYouTubevideos and countdown
until the album is dropped on the
band’s website.

I like Vampire Weekend a lot, and
Iwant its new album, titled Contra, to
blow me away. .

But like tons of otherfans out there,
I’rn questioningif mainstream success
will affect it musically and if Contra

will be afeeble attempt to emulate the
success of its ﬁrst album.

Even Paste Magazine’s “An Indie
Rock Alphabet Book” book says,
“Vampire Weekend is hot, so we’re
told. But will they be around when
you’re another year old?”

Personally, I’ve got a good feeling
about Contra despite my anxiety and
doubt.

The band putadownloadablecopy

of the ﬁrst single off the album, “Hor—
chata,” on its website. ‘

Ithas awhimsical poppy beat that’s
reminiscent of the band’s older stuff
with a more dreamy quality to it and
sounds pretty good.

Promisingthough it may be, “Hor—
chata” is only one of 10 songs.

So for now I guess we’ll just have to
sit and wait until the new yearrto see
the new Vampire Weekend.

We ’Ve got you covered.

looking for a roommate; we've got you covered.

Cavo releases Whiney,
unoriginal first album

Cavo’s songs about champagne fail to impress

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staff Writer

-..Cav.o 

Bright  .DWark Days
Rocks like: The beats of Linkin Park
with the lyrics of Simple Plan

”PN Grade

 

, What the world really needs is more
self—pitying wannabe rock stars. At least
that’s what Cavo thinks.

The band’s debut album is a collage of

tired beats and stupefyingly bad lyrics,

accompanied by liner notes with band
member headshots so hilariously serious it
would be remiss not to mention them.
It’s hard to decide which lyrics to cite
as evidence of the band’s overwhelming
pretentious lunacy and inability to uti-

lize logic, as there are so many to choose

from.

 

 

The winning lyrics might come from

“Champagne” “Could’ve been the
champagne / Could’ve been the cocaine
/ Could’ve been the way you looked at me
that told me we were through.” How does
one communicate through alcohol and
drugs?

If you were somehow able to tune out
the words, the melodies and rhythms
aren’t terrible, just unremarkable. Most
tracks would be ﬁne for the last half of a
marathon~running mix or to put on shufﬂe
at a party where everyone is talking over
them, anyway.

If you were going to skip just one al-
bum this year, Bright Nights Dark Days
should be it. ' _ is

ground,” Wakeling said. “It worked
f'antastic.”. ,

With shocking unemployment
numbers, a recession on the brink of
a depression and the looming threat
of nuclear attack, 19705 Britain was
not so different from the United
States today. ,

Many fans call Wakeling “Skas—
tradamus,” a play on words of the
reputed prophet Nostradamus,
because of the eerie similarities be-
tween his older songs and modern
times. A '

- For instance, a line in the song “I
Am Your Flag,” originally about the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, could
easilybe applied to U.S. involvement
in the Middle East today: “I ran into
Afghanistan/Dyingto become aman/
Well, I am your ﬂag.”

Despite his prophetic lyrical abil-
ities, a lot has changed in the produc-
tion and distribution of music since
Wakeling started the band.

In the 1970s, recording a song
was a long and tedious process.
‘ After collaborating with DJ duo

was astounded to see the producer
“snatch the best bits of what every-
body played and with ﬁngers work-
ing faster than you can see  all of a
sudden you are listening to this piece
of music  it’s like the greatest hits

of what you’ve played in the last 16

minutes.”
The band plans onreleasing

these remixes as well as some new

songs at the end of the year.

Wakeling is considering selling
demos or EPs at live shows orputting
out a full-length album, but most of
all he just wants to ﬁnd the best way
to bring music directly to the listen-
ers, something that he says was hard
to come by through the “corrupt”
and “dishonest” music industry of
his heyday.

Although he makes a living off
album sales, he doesn’t necessarily
disagree with illegaldownloading.

“My suggestion to people [who
download music] is, ‘Why don’t you
send some money to Greenpeace or
Amnesty International. ” he said.
“That way there’s some decent kar-

downward slope it started with Make
Believe. ’ ’

Literally, every song is so generic
that it can be summed up with the
following: parties, ‘money and “bee—
yotches.” ‘ '

At age 39, you might think that
Rivers Cuomo would be reachingtrue
proﬁmdity, but instead, he’s mumbling
about Patron, cars and-partying with
Lil Wayne, of all people.

Maybe he’s making up for all the
time wasted writing musical master-
pieces inhis younger years, but by the
time the chorus of“LetItAll Hangout”
startswith Cuomo announcinghow he
willletitallhang outwithhis “homies,”
all sympathy vanishes.

At this point, it’s a terrifying
thought that the album could outdo
itselfwith stupidity, but somehow it
does with “In the Mall,” a two.—and—a-
half minute track about hanging out
inthe mall. -

Ifthere’s a saving grace for this al-
bum, it’s the instrumentation.

Armed with syncopated drum
beats, synthesized power-punk mel-
odies and bombastic club bass that
would put 50 Cent to shame, when it

comes to head-bobbing (and maybe '

some drunken air guitar), Raditude
is nearly irresistible. I
The main issue with this album is
not that Weezer is no longer the band
it was with Pinkerton.
It’s that the band tries desperately
to be a band it shouldn’t want to be:
shallow and forgettable.

Pitt latest turn-around team for Toby Rens

Coach Toby Rens has a history of rebuilding struggling volleyball teams

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

When the Pitt women’s volleyball
team hired a new head coach before
last season, it knew what it was get-
ting. Coach Toby Rens is more than
a small-town kid now making noise
as the volleyball coach of a big-city
team. He’s a proven winner, a pro-
gram builder and rebuilder.

Dramatic turnarounds are the
norm for Rens.

His team found success this
year by putting away opponents
and playing an up-tempo game —
both staples of Rens’ style.

But this season didn’t look so
promising at the beginning of the
year.

Going into the season, this
year looked like a challenge. Five
seniors, including four starters,
were gone — the departed players
were an important part of Pitt’s of-
fensive production last season.

Consequently, the Panthers
were picked to ﬁnish eighth in the
Big East out of 15 teams in a pre-

season poll. That would put them .

just barely in the postseason Big
East tournament.

The onething Pitt didn’t need V V

was panic, which certainly wouldn’t

be provided by Rens.

“We knew going into it as a
group that we were certainly ca-
pable of greater things than tha ,”
Rens said about the preseason ex-
pectations. “That’s where it’s fun
to enjoy the success. Enjoying the

success has been very fulﬁlling be-
cause they’ve grown so much as a
team.”

Last year, despite transitioning
a Pitt team from a head coach leav-
ing right before the season, Rens
led Pitt to the Big East tournament

and an upset win over Cincinnati in
the ﬁrst round.

But that was last year —~ a win
over Cincinnati and a quick exit
in the second round. This year,
the Panthers want to sustain a run
through the Big East Champion-

of playing in the NCAA Tourna-

“I think it’d mean a lot [to earn
a berth to the Tournament]. This
group has worked exceptionally
hard, they want it dearly,” Rens

Young Panthers optimistic despite inexperience‘

With six new players, the Panthers are sure to mix things up this year

Evan Burgos A

Senior Staff Writer

You get a lot of player turnover in
college sports.. Four years is the
maximum a player can suit up for
a program, and in the cases of star
players, it’s often fewer. That is
the main issue the Panthers face
this season: the departure of four
starters, two now donning NBA
uniforms and another playing pro
ball overseas.

The Panthers’ roster consists of
far more freshmen than seniors,
with six newbies to only two four-
year players, one of whom, Chase

Adams, is a transfer. Sophomore
Ashton Gibbs and junior Brad Wa-

namaker ﬁgure to be  program’s g

leaders this season, along with se-

nior _]ermaine°‘Dixon,  squad’s »

The ﬁve probable starters for
Friday’s seasonopener against Wof—

ford have one start initheir com-
bined collegiate careers.

Ipg a stark contrast to lastuyear, _ C T
when Pitt started the same ﬁvej , ,
players every game. Forrmany, this _

would be reason for coﬁcern.

Head coachjamie Dixon does_n’t’l, 1. . V .

see it that way. _ 

“We’ve set no limitations,” Dix? . _
on said. “Most coaches would be ‘

’ as you want to be, you’re as young

as you play. We have no excuses. We
decide how good we’re going to be.
It’s not our youth, our young guys

or where we’re picked.”

_ Dixon remarked on the impor-
tance of timing, patience and execu-
tion with this year’s team. With an
inexperienced rotation, Dixon said
that, at times, players give great
effort but still struggle to execute

‘ You’re as young as you want to be, you’re
as young as you play. We have no excuses.

and play with the right timing in
the system. Despite that, the coach
believes his players will respond“
well to the challenges of increased!
responsibility and playing time.

“We’ve got some guys who have
played behind very good players last
year, and this is their opportunity,”
Dixon said. “They have conﬁdence
in themselves. We are who we are."
I have a lot of conﬁdence in this
group and where they will be.”

Players like Gibbs and Wana-
maker feel similarly. Both saw some
important minutes last season and
are ready to be leaders this year...-
Both are brimming with conﬁ-
dence.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

V The year was 1996, and I had a lot on

my mind. Fall weather began to creep

in, and, with it, the ﬂeeting feeling of
summer dissipated into the cold Phila-

delphia air. That year, I entered third
grade and, for the ﬁrst time in my life,

would have homework. That worried
me, butI had something more impor-

tantto consider: I neededanewpair of
basketball shoes. ‘

My mother obliged and drove me
to Sneaker Stadium. I must have been
standing in front of the shoe rack for
two minutes before I knew. It was a
no-brainer. Something drew me to
them — the red toe cap and Reebok
symbol againstwhite leather, the trans-
lucent baby-blue sole, the honeycomb
airbubbles on the side andthe number
“3” stitched on the back. They were his
ﬁrstsignature shoe and now theywere
mine. The Reebok Question.

Before I had ever seen him play in
anNBA game, we were sharing sneak-
ers. And Iwas gripped. My 76ers had

selected Allen Iverson with the No. 1
overall pickinthe NBA Draft. He’s been
my favorite athlete ever since.

For the decade—plus Iversonwas in
Philadelphia, he was by far the city’s
most beloved athlete. Before he came
along, going to a Sixers game meant
Dana Barros and Shawn Bradley. You
can imagine the excruciation.

So whenAI became the best scorer
intheNBA,wontheMVPandledPhilly
to the NBA ﬁnals, the city went nuts.
The team won game one of the 2001
ﬁnals in dramatic overtime fashion
against the Lakers. Iverson poured in
48 points. Although itpromptlylostthe
series inﬁve games, thatrun of success

is the most exciting thing I have ever

witnessed as a die—hard Philadelphia
sports fan. To me, it’s equal with the
Phillies’ 2008 World Series win. Even
in defeat, Iverson has always been my
8113’-

During his time as a Sixer, Iverson
amassed countless accolades: the MVP,
four league scoring titles, two All-Star
game MVPs and 10 appearances inthe

' game, Rookie of the Year, three—time

Rens seeks NCAA Tournament success

Diana Connor I SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Toby Rens observes his current turn—around team.

Rens 4 13

said. “No one on the team has
tasted that as far as winning the
Big East or going to the NCAAS. We
still have a lot of volleyball ahead of
us, but winning the Big East Cham-
pionship is the easiest way for us to
seal the deal.”

Rens wants to make the Pan-
thers NCAA Tournament regulars,
just as he has brought other teams
he has coached into the Tourna-
ment.

Prior to Pitt, Rens established
Long Island University as a peren-
nial Northeast Conference power.
Rens took the Blackbirds to North-

. east Conference titles and auto-

matic NCAA Tournament berths
in each of his four seasons there.
LIU averaged 26.5 victories a year
under Rens, including a 32-7 mark
in 2004, which isthe winningest
season in LIU history.

Before LIU, Rens was the head
coach at the University of Mary-
land-Eastern Shore. There, he
miraculously turned the program
around. UMES went 3-28 during

his ﬁrst season, but skyrocketed to

20-15 the following year and earned
a berth in the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference ﬁnal.

For completing one of the big-
gest turnarounds in Division I vol-
leyball, Rens was named the 2002
MEAC Coach of the Year.

Honestly, for me it’s
all about the players.

Toby Rens

Now it’s the Panthers year to
turn around.

“I’m just really happy for this
group to be in this type of position
where they put so much hard work
into developing as a team,” Rens
said. “That to me is the really fulﬁll-
ing thing as a coach.”

Rens grew up in a town of 700
people, he said, and learned to play
volleyball by playing with one of his
younger sisters, Trisha.

.3
“We even created our own net

and court from a clothes-line pole
to a tree with rope,” he said. “We
would pepper or shoot hoops until
it got dark.”

Rens said his sister’s initial inter-
est got him hooked on it. He played
in high school, in a league similar
to an AAU basketball league, and
college, then became an assistant
coach at his alma mater, Morning-
side College. What happened after
is what brought Rens to Pitt.

Now, he enjoys watching his
players improve and progress.

“Honestly, for me it’s all about
the players. It’s been ﬁm to see their
success and to see the development
of them as a team to see their con-
ﬁdence level grow week by week,”
he said. “That’s the fulﬁlling thing
as a coach, to see the growth col-
lectively as a team to seethe things
worked on in practice come to frui-
tion on the court in games.”
